Foram preparadas, modificadas e aperfei\u00e7oadas v\u00e1rias \nsuspens\u00f5es a fim de optimizar a etapa de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o. Para diminuir a \ntemperatura de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos filmes espessos, de forma a tornar a sua \nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o compat\u00edvel com o uso de substratos de cobre, recorreu-se \u00e0 \nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes aditivos de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, nomeadamente um vidro \ncomposto por SiO2, PbO, Al2O3, B2O3 e uma mistura de dois \u00f3xidos (B2O3 e \nPbO). Foram ent\u00e3o depositados por EPD filmes de PZT sobre folhas de cobre \nem presen\u00e7a destes aditivos de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o; primeiramente com a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n5, 10 e 20 % em peso de vidro e, posteriormente, com a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de 1 e 3 % em \npeso de uma mistura de diferentes propor\u00e7\u00f5es dos \u00f3xidos B2O3 e PbO (90/10, \n80/20 e 50/50) e os filmes foram sinterizados a diferentes temperaturas, entre \n800\u00baC e 900\u00baC e em atmosfera de baixa press\u00e3o parcial de oxig\u00e9nio (pO2) (~ \n5x10\n\n-5\n e 8x10\n\n-7\n atm). Verificou-se que a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o em presen\u00e7a de p\u00f3s de \n\nvidro origina filmes n\u00e3o uniformes, com superf\u00edcies irregulares e \nmicroestruturas porosas, o que se deve \u00e0 dificuldade em obter suspens\u00f5es \ndesfloculadas e est\u00e1veis. A resposta diel\u00e9ctrica dos v\u00e1rios filmes espessos de \nPZT sobre cobre foi analisada em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da frequ\u00eancia \u00e0 temperatura \nambiente. Verificou-se que a presen\u00e7a dos \u00f3xidos aditivos de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \nmelhorou a densifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos filmes. A adi\u00e7\u00e3o da mistura de 3 % em peso de \n50%B2O3 + 50%PbO originou a melhor resposta diel\u00e9ctrica de filmes \nsinterizados a 800 \u00baC e 850\u00baC (permitividade de ~1195 e perda diel\u00e9ctrica \nde~0,02). Os resultados obtidos foram comparados com os da adi\u00e7\u00e3o de uma \nmistura de V2O3 e PbO, previamente reportados. Foi ent\u00e3o demonstrado que \nos filmes espessos de PZT aditivados com misturas de B2O3 e PbO e \nfabricados por deposi\u00e7\u00e3o electrofor\u00e9tica em substratos de cobre flex\u00edveis s\u00e3o \npass\u00edveis de serem usados como condensadores embutidos em circuitos da \nmicroelectr\u00f3nica. \n \n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nkeywords \n\n \nLead Zirconate Titanate, PZT, thick films, Eletrophoretic Deposition, EPD, \nelectric properties, microelectronic applications. \n. \n \n\nabstract \n\n \n \nPowders of lead zirconate titanate with a particle size of about 300 nm, were \nused as base material for the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of PZT thick \nfilms on flexible copper substrates. With these powders, several \nsuspensions were prepared, modified and improved in order to optimize the \ndeposition step. To lower the sintering temperature of thick films to make its \nemployment consistent with the use of copper substrates, different sintering \nadditives, including a glass comprising of SiO2, PbO, Al2O3, and B2O3 and a \nmixture of two oxides (PbO and B2O3) were studied. Films were then \ndeposited by EPD of PZT films on copper sheets in the presence of \nsintering additives, first with the addition of 5, 10 and 20% by weight of glass \nand, later, with the addition of 1 and 3% by weight of a mixture of PbO and \nB2O3 (90/10, 80/20 and 50/50) and the films were sintered at different \ntemperatures between 800 \u00ba C and 900 \u00ba C in an atmosphere of low oxygen \npartial pressure (pO2) (~ 5x10\n\n-5\n and 8x10\n\n-7\n atm). It was found that the \n\ndeposition in the presence of glass powder causes non-uniform films with \nrough surfaces and porous microstructures, which is due to the difficulty in \nobtaining deflocculated and stable suspensions. The dielectric response of \nthe various PZT thick films on copper was examined as a function of \nfrequency at room temperature. It was found that the presence of oxide \nsintering additives improved the densification of the films. The addition of \nmixing 3wt% of 50% B2O3 + 50% PbO led to an optimized dielectric \nresponse for the films sintered at 800 \u00ba C and 850 \u00ba C (permittivity ~1195 \nand losses ~0.02). The results were compared with PZT films prepared with \nthe addition of a mixture of PbO and V2O3, previously reported. In \nconclusion, PZT thick films manufactured by EPD on copper flexible \nsubstrates and sintered in the presence of PbO and B2O3 (as sintering aid \nmixtures) can be used as embedded capacitors in microelectronic circuits. \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\ni \n\n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nList of Symbols \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...iii \n\nList of Abbreviations \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026v \n\nList of Figures \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026vii \n\nList of Tables \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...xi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nii \n\n \n\nIndex \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nLead zirconate titanate, PbZr1-xTixO3 (PZT) has a perovskite type structure. This structure \n\nis adopted by many functional oxides that have the chemical formula ABO3 and several of them \n\nexhibit important and useful technological properties such as ferroelectricity, pyroelectricity, \n\npiezoelectricity, non linear optical behaviour, inter alia, that make them very useful in \n\napplications such as catalysts, sensors, actuators, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), \n\nnanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), memories, superconductors, etc.[1],[2], [7],  \n\nIn PZT, Ti4+ and Zr4+ ions occupy randomly B sites of the perovskite lattice. At high \n\ntemperatures PZT has the cubic perovskite structure, which is paraelectric. On cooling below \n\nthe Curie point, the structure undergoes a phase transition to form a ferroelectric tetragonal or \n\nrhombohedral phase. In the tetragonal phase, the spontaneous polarization is along the&lt;100> \n\nset of directions while in the rhombohedral phase the polarization is along the&lt;111> set of \n\ndirections. Below the Zr/Ti ratio of 95/5 the solid solution is antiferroelectric with an \n\northorhombic phase. On the application of an electric field to this composition a double \n\nhysteresis loop is obtained. This is because of the strong influence of the antiferroelectric \n\nPbZrO3 (Lead Zirconate) phase.\n[3]  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1 Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT): General Aspects  \n\nThe solid solution between PbZrO3 and PbTiO3 (Lead Titanate), well known as PZT, is \n\nimportant for electronic applications due to the peculiar electric properties displayed by some of \n\nthe compositions, namely those within the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB), \n\nPbZr0.52Ti0.48O3. MPB compositions have mixed crystallographic symmetries and therefore are \n\neasily poled in the polycrystalline form and the electromechanical properties are maximised. \n\nAbove the ferroelectric phase transition Tc (being the Curie temperature) at >350\u00baC for the x = \n\n0.48 MPB composition, PZT is in the paraelectric phase, with a Pm3m cubic centrosymmetric \n\nspace group. Below Tc, a mixture of ferroelectric rhombohedral and tetragonal phases exists \n\nand the high dielectric permittivity (?r ~1000), high remanent polarization value (Pr ~30 \u00b5C/cm\n2), \n\nand high piezoelectric coefficients (d33 ~ 350 pC/N) make it useful in a wide range of \n\napplications.[4]  \n\nFigure 1 depicts the perovskite-type PZT unit cell above the Curie temperature and its \n\ndistorted unit cell below the Curie temperature. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1: Perovskite lead zirconate titanate (PZT) unit cell in the symmetric cubic state, \n\nabove the Curie temperature (left picture), and tetragonally distorced below the Curie \n\ntemperature (right picture).[5] \n\n \n\n \n\nPZT MPB compositions exhibit anomalously augmented dielectric and piezoelectric \n\nproperties as a result of the enhanced polarizability arising from the coupling between two \n\nequivalent energy states, i.e., tetragonal and rhombohedraI phases, allowing optimum domain \n\nreorientation during the poling process.[5] These properties make PZT-based compounds one of \n\n\n\n \n\nthe most prominent and useful electroceramics\n\napplications.  \n\nFigure 2 depicts the phase diagram of PZT\n\nvalue x in the PZT formula.

When the \n\nAO3 layers are arranged in cubic close packing, the BO6 octahedra are connected exclusively \n\nthrough corner sharing, and the structure is termed a cubic perovskite (Figure 2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Prototypical perovskite unit cell (ideal cubic perovskite).[13] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn an ideal cubic perovskite, the A and B cations establish their equilibrium bond \n\ndistances to oxygen without inducing any distortion of the unit cell, and dA-O = ?2(dB-O). The \n\nresultant cubic symmetry is Pmm and the so-called Goldschmidt tolerance factor describes the \n\nperovskite lattice distortion and is defined as: \n\n \n\n(1) \n\n \n\nwhere RA, RB, and RO stand for the ionic radii of the A-site, B-site, and anion ions respectively. \n \n\n As mentioned above this is the structure assumed by PZT, with a B-cation in the center \n\nof the cube (light blue ions in Figure 3), oxygen ions at the face centres of the cube (red ions in \n\n \nA - Anion \n \n \n \n \n \nO - Oxygen \n \n \n \nB - Cation \n\n( )\n,\n\n2\nOB\n\nOA\n\nRR\n\nRR\nt\n\n+\n\n+\n=\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nFigure 3), and lead ions in the cube corner. However, within this ordered perovskite structure an \n\na extensive disorder in the direction of the B-cation distortions within their oxygen octahedral \n\ncan take place. There is also disorder in the direction of the displacements of both lead and \n\noxygen ions away from their perfect perovskite positions. It is this local disorder within the \n\nframework of the orderly perovskite lattice that gives PZT its interesting properties.[14] \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n1.3 Dielectric, Piezoelectricity and Ferroelectricity of Ceramic Materials  \n\nThe group of functional materials (related to materials whose \u201cfunction\u201d is associated with \n\ntheir electric, magnetic, and or optical properties) mainly includes dielectrics, pyroelectrics, \n\npiezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, ferroelectric relaxors, incipient ferroelectrics, semiconductors, ionic \n\nconductors, superconductors, electro-optics and magnetic materials. It is common to identify the \n\nclass of functional materials with applications such as Materials for Information Technology, \n\nMaterials for Electrical Energy Conversion, Materials for Biologic Applications, Materials for \n\nSpace Technology, among others. The application of functional materials, typified by \n\nelectroactive materials including piezoelectrics, pyroelectrics and ferroelectrics, for sensing and \n\nactuation spans over most if not all industrial sectors.[15] \n\n \n\n 1.3.1 Dielectric Properties \n\nWhen an electric field E is applied to an ideal insulator there is no long-range charge \n\ntransport. In an insulator there is only a short-range dislocation of the positive and negative \n\ncharge centre, which causes electric dipole moments in the material. The material is called a \n\ndielectric. The effect of the electrical field can be twofold defined: \n\n1. The electric field induces electrical dipoles and aligns them in the field direction. In \n\nother words, the material does not contain electric dipoles without the electric field. \n\n2. The electric field aligns electrical dipoles that are already present in the material. In \n\nother words, the material contains spontaneous electric dipoles. In this case the dipoles are \n\nrandomly oriented and for zero fields the net polarization is null. \n\nFigure 4 depicts the dielectric response of a regular dielectric material under the electric \n\nfield.[16] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4: Dielectric constant dependence on the electric bias field.[Adapted from reference 23] \n\n \n\nThe total effect of an electric field on a dielectric material is called polarization (expressed \n\nin \u00b5C/cm\u00b2). Several polarization mechanisms can be identified within a material: atomic, ionic, \n\ndipolar and space charge; being each related to the nature of the charged entities, which suffer \n\ncharge displacement, or to the nature of the displacement. \n\nDielectrics are insulators with high dielectric permittivity. Dielectric permittivity or \n\ndielectric constant is defined as the capacity of a material to store electrical charge and it gives \n\nrise to the simplest practical application of a dielectric material such as a capacitor.[16] \n\nThe permittivity of a material is commonly measured as a change in dielectric \n\ndisplacement, D, with applied field, E, as shown in Equation 2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(2) [13] \n\n \n\n  \n\nwhere ? ?r stands for the relative permittivity, D for the dielectric displacement and E for the \n\napplied field. The dielectric displacement in turn establishes the relationship between \n\npolarization and permittivity, as in Equation 3 and results in permittivity being essentially the \n\nchange in polarization with applied field as in Equation 4.  \n\n \n(3)[13] \n\n \n\n,\n0=\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n=\nE\n\nr\nE\n\nD\n?\n\n,4 PED ?+=\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n(4)[13] \n\n                          \n\nwhere? P stands for the polarization. This holds particularly true near the ferroelectric phase \n\ntransition where the change in polarization with field is much larger than unity and dominates \n\nthe relation.  \n\nThe several polarization responses of the dielectric under an electric field are being \n\nincreasingly used in micro and nanoelectronic devices.[13] The various polarization mechanisms \n\ncontributing to permittivity, described in Figure 5, are: i) electronic polarization, ?e, defined as \n\nthe shifting and/or stretching of the electron distribution around the nucleus; ii) ionic \n\npolarizations, ?I identified by the shifting of oppositely charged ions from their equilibrium \n\nposition by an applied field; iii) dipole polarizations, ?d, which takes into account the rotation of \n\ninternal dipole moments to align with an applied force; and iv) space charge polarizations ?s.c., \n\nrelated to the movement of charged internal defects with applied force. The sum of these \n\npolarization mechanisms gives the total change in polarization and thus the total contribution to \n\npermittivity. These contributions are generally frequency dependent, revealing a dispersive \n\nbehaviour, with all polarizations mechanisms active at low frequencies and only electronic \n\npolarizations active at high frequencies.[13]  \n\n  \n\nFigure 5: Frequency dispersion of a dielectric showing all possible polarization \n\nmechanisms and the expected frequencies for their inactivation.[16] \n\n \n\nAs each polarization mechanism reaches its frequency limit, subsequent increase in loss \n\nis observed. This loss increase can be attributed to a dissipation of heat energy by friction of the \n\nspace charges and dipoles as they move under the applied field.[13] Electronic and ionic \n\n;41\nE\n\nP\nr\n\n?\n?\n\n+= ??\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n,\n\u00b4\u00b4\n\ntan\n?\n?\n\n? =\n\npolarizations show loss peaks over much finer frequency ranges than space charge and dipole \n\npolarizations. The peaks here are not so strongly related to internal friction, but are due to \n\nresonance of the bound electrons to the nuclear cores by high frequency electromagnetic \n\nradiation.[13]  \n\nThere is an intimate relationship between loss and the permittivity of a material. If the \n\nrelative permittivity is expressed as a complex function, Equation 5, one may identify two main \n\ncomponents to the permittivity: the real part, ?', and the imaginary part, ?'': \n\n \n(5) \n\n \n\nThe loss in the material can then be expressed in terms of a phase angle between the \n\npolarizing field and the response of the material commonly called the dissipation factor or loss \n\ntangent delta (Equation 6) \n\n \n\n \n\n(6) \n\n \n\n                     \n\nwhere ? stands for the phase angle of impedance as shown in Figure 6. For perfect insulators \n\nthe phase angle is 90\u00b0, while for perfect conductors the phase angle is 0\u00b0. Real materials have \n\nvalues intermediate between the two extremes.[13] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Schematic representation of the real versus imaginary components of the \n\npermittivity separated by a phase angle ?.[13] \n\n \n\nThe parameter tan ? is a measure of the energy dissipated per cycle and the energy \n\nstored in the dielectric and a quality factor Q (Equation 7) can be defined as: \n\n,\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4 ??? i\nr\n\n?=\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n(7) \n\n \n\nwhich represents an important design parameter for practical applications.[16] \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3.2 Piezoelectric and Ferroelectric Properties \n\nIn piezoelectric materials there is a coupling between electrical and mechanical energies \n\nand mechanical energy can be converted in electrical energy and vice-versa. [17] The direct \n\neffect (designated as a generator) is identified with the phenomenon whereby electrical charges \n\n(polarization) are generated from a mechanical stress (first part of Figure 7, designated as \n\npiezoelectric effect), whereas the converse effect (designated as a motor) is associated with the \n\nmechanical movement generated by the application of an electrical field (second part of Figure \n\n7 and designated as reverse piezoelectric effect).[12]  \n\nThe direct piezoelectric effect was originally discovered in 1880 by Jacques and Pierre \n\nCurie. Piezoelectrics did not come into widespread use until the First World War, when quartz \n\nwas used in SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging). Quartz was replaced in the Second \n\nWorld War by Barium Titanate, and this has become one of the most important piezoelectric \n\nmaterials of the modern era. They are both now commonly used in many ways.[6] \n\nFerroelectrics are polar dielectrics for which the dipole moment can be switched between \n\ntwo or more equilibrium symmetry equivalent states by the application of an appropriate electric \n\nfield.[17] \n\nOf the 32 point groups of the crystal structures, 20 can be characterized as piezoelectric, \n\nthat is, upon the application of a mechanical stress, an electronic displacement can be induced \n\nin the crystal. Equivalently, an applied electric field can induce a mechanical strain, a property \n\nknown as the converse piezoelectric effect. The 20 point groups, which can support \n\npiezoelectricity, are non-centrosymetric. While the lack of a centre of symmetry is a necessary \n\ncondition for piezoelectricity, it is not sufficient to observe a piezoelectric effect.[13] \n\nFurther categorization of the piezoelectric point groups reveals that in ten out of the \n\ntwenty, the electronic polarization is spontaneous, remaining finite in the absence of an applied \n\nstress or electric field. This spontaneous polarization is characteristic of pyroelectricity and is a \n\nconsequence of the atomic arrangement within the unit cell where the positive and negative \n\ncharge centres is not coincident, thus establishing a resultant spontaneous electric dipole.[13] \n\nUnder an electric field, ions undergo asymmetric displacement and results in a small \n\nchange in the crystal dimension, which is proportional to the applied field. Such electric field - \n\ninduced strain (or piezoelectricity) has found extensive applications in actuators and sensors.[17] \n\n,\ntan\n\n1\n\n?\n=Q\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nThe knowledge of the ferroelectric nature of ceramic BaTiO3 proved to be very useful \n\nwhen it was discovered by Gray (in 1945) that an external electric field could orient the domains \n\nwithin the grains, thus producing a ceramic material that acted very similar to a single crystal \n\npossessing both ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. This electrical aligning, or \u201cpoling\u201d \n\nprocess as it has come to be called, was thus correctly identified as the key to turning an inert \n\nceramic into an electromechanically active material with a multitude of industrial and \n\ncommercial uses.[12]  \n\nWith poling the ceramic becomes extremely useful, provided however that it is not heated \n\nabove its Curie temperature (TC), where it loses its polarization and all of the orientation of the \n\npolarization produced by the poling process.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na) Piezoelectric effect     b) Reverse Piezoelectric effect \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Piezoelectric effect and reverse piezoelectric effect.[Adapted from reference 9]  \n\n \n\nAll ferroelectric materials are pyroelectric, however, not all pyroelectric materials are \n\nferroelectric. Below the transition temperature (Curie temperature, Tc) ferroelectric and \n\npyroelectric materials are polar and have a spontaneous polarization or electric dipole moment. \n\nFor ferroelectric materials this polarity can be fully, in part reoriented or reversed through the \n\napplication of an electric field. Complete reversal of the spontaneous polarization is called \n\n\u201cswitching\u201d.[13] \n\nThe reverse polarization can be observed by measuring the ferroelectric hysteresis as it \n\nis shown in Figure 8. As the electric field strength is increased, the polar domains start to align \n\nin the positive direction giving rise to a rapid increase in the polarization (OB). At very high field \n\nlevels, the polarization reaches a saturation value.[3] \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Polarization versus electric field (P-E) hysteresis loop for a typical ferroelectric \n\ncrystal.[3] \n\n \nThe polarization does not fall to zero when the external field is removed. At zero external \n\nfields, some of the domains remain aligned in the positive direction; hence the crystal will show \n\na remnant polarization (Pr). The crystal cannot be completely depolarized until a field of \n\nmagnitude OF is applied in the negative direction. The external field needed to reduce the \n\npolarization to zero is called the coercive field (Ec). If the field is increased to a more negative \n\nvalue, the direction of polarization flips and hence a hysteresis loop is obtained. The value of \n\nthe spontaneous polarization (Ps) (OE) is obtained by extrapolating the curve onto the \n\npolarization axes (CE).[3] \n\nThe relative dielectric constant, in equation 8, increases as the temperature approaches \n\nthe Curie point. In this region the dielectric constant is most sensitive to the magnitude of the \n\napplied electric field. Above Tc, permittivity decreases with temperature and often exhibits Curie-\n\nWeiss behaviour. This is shown in Equation 8, \n\n \n(8) \n\nwhere C stands for the Curie constant. In the paraelectric regime, the spontaneous polarization \n\nis zero but the permittivity remains high. This effect is illustrated in the following figure (Figure \n\n9).[13], [16] \n\n,\n0\n\n0\nTT\n\nC\nr\n\n?\n+= ??\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9: Temperature dependence of the relative permittivity for a ferroelectric with a \n\nfirst order phase transition displaying Curie-Weiss type behaviour.[13] \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n1.4 The Importance of Piezoelectrics and Ferroelectrics \n\n \n\n1.4.1 General Applications of Piezoelectrics and Ferroelectrics  \n\nDue to the peculiar electrical properties of piezo -, piro - and ferroelectrics, that include \n\nhigh dielectric permittivity, high piezo and pyroelectric coefficients, in some cases low dielectric \n\nlosses, high tunability of the permittivity with the electrical field, hysteretic response of the \n\npolarization, these materials find applications in a wide variety of electronic and microelectronic \n\napplications (as stated before), as indicated in Figure 10. These applications range from \n\nsensors and actuators, to electro optic based devices, having a particular relevance as \n\ndielectrics for capacitors and memories applications that per se cover utilization areas from \n\ntelecommunications, electronics and engineering to healthcare. Some applications of \n\npiezoelectric ceramics are: medical ultrasound transducers, gas igniters, displacement \n\ntransducers, piezoelectric transformers and impact printer heads.[3]  \n\nSpecific applications for ferroelectric ceramics are in capacitors, explosive-to-electrical \n\ntransducers (EETs)[12], pyroelectric detectors and surface acoustic wave substrates[3], high \n\ndielectric constant capacitors, infrared detectors, piezoelectric transducers, optical modulators, \n\noptical waveguides, non-volatile memory chips and capacitors for dynamic random access \n\nmemories (DRAM). Therefore they can be used to transform acoustic waves to electrical signal \n\nin sonar detectors and to convert electric field into motion in actuators and mechanical scanners \n\nrequiring fine control. In a broader sense, ferroelectric materials can be used for pyroelectric \n\nand piezoelectric sensors (as mentioned before), voltage tunable capacitors, infrared detectors, \n\nsurface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, microactuators, and nonvolatile random-access \n\nmemories (NVRAMs), including the potential production of one transistor memory cells, and \n\napplications requiring nonlinear optic components. Another set of potential applications seeks to \n\nexploit the ferroelastic properties in stacked templates where they are justaposed to \n\nferromagnetic materials.[3], [12], [18] \n\nSome of these applications are more appropriate for bulk materials and others for films \n\nand some for both bulk and films, as indicated in Figure 10. Similar to most materials, the \n\nsuccessful application of these piezoelectric, pyroelectric, ferroelectric, electrostrictive, and \n\nelectro optic ceramics and films is highly dependent on the relative ease of adaptation to useful \n\nand reliable devices. This is, to a great extent, the reason why they have been so successful \n\nover the years in finding an increasing number of applications. Their simplicity, compact size, \n\nlow cost, and high reliability are very attractive features to the design engineer and have \n\nguaranteed a continuous increase of their applications. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10: Applications of bulk and film ceramic electronic materials.[12]  \n\n \n\n  \n\n1.4.2 Applications for PZT Materials \n\nPiezoelectrics based on PZT show the broadest range of individual applications ranging \n\nfrom applications on health-care, consumer electronics and environment monitoring,[3], [19] as \n\nmicrosensors and actuators for medical, military, telecommunication, environmental, vehicle \n\nand office automation industries (once again similarity as ferro- and piezoelectric \n\napplications).[3], [21]. PZT-based compounds are primarily used in the manufacturing of \n\nultrasound transducers. A secondary use is in the manufacturing of ceramic capacitors and \n\nmicroelectronic chips. PZT films have been widely investigated for applications in non-volatile \n\nrandom access memories (NVRAMs) (similar with piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics \n\napplications), as well field effect transistors (FETs), ultrasonic vibrators, filters, microactuators \n\nand microsensors, dielectric capacitors; IR sensors, buffer layers, integrated optics, electro optic \n\nshutters, AR coatings and electrooptic displays.[15] \n\nDue to its lead content and to the environmental restrictions associated with its use, there \n\nis the need to find alternative materials to PZT. There are currently several R&amp;D (Research and \n\nDevelopment) programs for the search of lead free alternatives to PZT, but until now none of \n\nthe barium titanate (BaTiO3), sodium potassium niobate ((Na0.5K0.5)NbO3) and or sodium \n\nbismuth titanate ((Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3) based compositions demonstrate similar properties to the \n\nones of PZT.[4] The so far reported properties for these several alternative materials are \n\nconsiderably inferior (as one can witness from table 2). This is the reason why PZT is still the \n\nmost important piezoelectric material and is still considered, even for modern applications such \n\nas composite structures with multiferroics. 15] \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTable 2: Electrical properties comparison between current major lead-free systems and \nPZT.[20]  \n \n \n\n Perovskite type structure ferroelectrics \n\n BaTiO3 (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3 (Na0.5K0.5)NbO3 PZT \n\nCurie Temperature (\u00b0C) 120 320 420 300~400 \n\nd33 (pC/N) 190 120~200 100~416 200~500 \n\nd31 (pC/N) -78 -7.5 -30~-152 -130 \n\nDielectric Constant \n(at 1 kHz) \n\n1500~6000 ~1700 200~500 1000~4000 \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n1.5 Fabrication of Piezoelectric and Ferroelectric Films \n\n \n\n1.5.1 Bulk versus Films and Thin versus Thick Films \n\nThe current trend in microelectronics industry is towards device miniaturization, \n\nincreased functionalization and greater reliability with low processing costs. Films respond \n\nbetter to these requirements than their bulk counterparts.  \n\nThin films normally refer to layers with thickness below ~1\u00b5m and thick films above this \n\nrange. However, the prime difference lies in the manufacturing process of the films.[21]. Thin and \n\nthick films of dielectric materials are being considered to replace the dielectric components \n\npresently in use in the form of bulk ceramics. This has been the driving force for the search for \n\nfabrication processes for mass-produced dielectric films with repeatable performance at low \n\ncosts.[15]  \n\nFor some of the applications (communication industry, resonators, filters and antennas), \n\nthick films are required, rather than thin films, as these are volume devices that store \n\nelectromagnetic energy within the dielectric volume. Furthermore, the ability to process thick \n\nfilms conformably on substrates, and also directly on metallic foils, opens up the possibility of \n\ninnovative structures and designs.[12] However, for thick films the required high sintering \n\ntemperatures present a challenge for processing on base metal substrates.[3]  \n\nThe techniques employed to prepare films are considerably different form the techniques \n\nused to prepared bulk ceramics and several techniques for making films are presently available. \n\nThese can be divided into two main categories: physical deposition techniques, such as \n\nphysical vapour deposition (PVD), and chemical techniques, which include chemical vapour \n\ndeposition (CVD) and chemical solution deposition (CSD).[3] For the case of physical methods, \n\nthe way the particles (atoms or ions) are removed from the target results in various deposition \n\nmethods, such as radio frequency sputtering, ion beam sputtering, evaporation, electron beam \n\nand laser ablation, among others.[21], [22]  \n\nAdvantages of PVD techniques include: dry processing, high levels of purity, the \n\npossibility of growing epitaxial films, and compatibility with the processing of semiconductor \n\nintegrated circuits. Nevertheless, the difficulty in controlling the stoichiometry of multicomponent \n\nfilms, the slow rates of deposition, the need to high-temperature deposition annealing \n\ncrystallization and the high costs to purchase equipment and maintenance are the main \n\ndisadvantages of these methods for the preparation of functional coatings.[21] \n\nThe second group of technical processes (chemical) does not require a vacuum \n\nenvironment. Chemical methods are generally characterized by higher deposition rates, good \n\ncontrol of stoichiometry, the production of large area defect free films and lower equipment \n\ncosts. These advantages make chemical processes, for example, chemical vapour deposition, \n\nvery attractive in terms of industrial production. However, CVD techniques are currently limited \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\ndue to the availability and toxicity of the precursor sources for functional materials what \n\npresents a major weakness of this technology. On the other hand, the methods of chemical \n\nsolution deposition technique, such as sol-gel, are becoming increasingly important for the \n\npreparation of films of piezo, pyro - and ferroelectric materials.[23]  \n\nThe wet chemical methods involve three distinct steps: the preparation of a solution, the \n\ndeposition of the solution onto the substrate by dip or spin coating and the subsequent thermal \n\ntreatment of the deposited layer to remove the organics, to crystallize the desired phase and to \n\ndensify the coatings. The details of experimental routines and chemical reactions, including the \n\nchoice of precursors, the choice of pressure and temperature, and reactions of polymerization, \n\nmake the difference among the several methods: sol-gel route, metalloorganic decomposition \n\n(MOD) and hydrothermal routes. Chemical methods provide a very convenient, economic and \n\nrapid processing methodology for the preparation of films or coatings on a variety of \n\nsubstrates.[21] \n\nThe methods described before are mainly used for the preparation of thin films. The \n\npreparation of films with thicknesses between 10 and 100 \u00b5m requires different technologies, \n\nsince thick films prepared by PVD and CVD become very expensive.[21] \n\nThe simplicity and versatility of sol-gel technique also makes it attractive for the \n\npreparation of thick films but has several problems. For instance there is a severe limitation \n\nrelated to the thickness of the coating that can be obtained from the conventional sol-gel spin or \n\ndip-coating process. Depending on the concentration and viscosity of the solutions the \n\nthickness of single layer is in the range of hundreds of nm. In order to reach the thickness of 10 \n\n\u00b5m the process of layer deposition has to be repeated many times. The deposition of a 10 \u00b5m \n\nthick green film will require several layers, making the process time consuming, tedious and \n\ncost-ineffective. Moreover the probability of creating defects (cracks, pores, and inclusions) in \n\nthe films increases with to the number of layers. \n\nDefect-free films of PZT with thickness lower than 1 \u00b5m are relatively easy to fabricate. \n[39, 41] Therefore, other methods have been used to prepare thick films and in particular \n\npiezoelectric thick films. Most of the techniques described are based on the densification of \n\npowder films. The powder layer is usually obtained after the deposition of a slurry onto the \n\nsubstrate. The powder can be delivered to the substrate by various techniques such as tape \n\ncasting, screen-printing, inkjet or electrophoretic methods. Dense films are then obtained after \n\nsintering. In all of these technologies, the sintering is a critical step because of the large surface \n\narea exposed to the environment and because of the relatively small thickness. Moreover, the \n\nfilms are under the influence of a controlled sintering process restricted due to the presence of \n\nthe substrate below. In the case of lead piezoelectrics for which a sintering temperature above \n\n800\u00b0 C is usually required, the evaporation of volatile elements (Pb) and problems of \n\nconsolidation may occur.[21]  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nTape casting is an ordinary process for making laminated thick layers of multilayer \n\nstructures, like multilayer capacitors and actuators of PZT[12] and 1-3 PZT-based piezoelectric \n\ncomposites, used as transducers for ultrasonic devices, naval sonar systems, medical diagnosis \n\nand non - destructive testing of materials. Although a low-cost process that allows mass \n\nproductions of laminates, tape casting is not easily compatible with the deposition onto rigid \n\nsubstrates and the suspension and firing without deflection are very difficult.[15] The screen-\n\nprinting method is one of the most appropriate technologies to prepare thick films with thickness \n\nranging from 10 to 30 \u00b5m. ln the screen printing technique the powder is also suspended in an \n\norganic solution composed of a solvent, a dispersant and a plasticizer. The suspension or ink is \n\napplied, with the aid of a racket, on the substrate through a screen. The thickness of the \n\ndeposited layer depends on the viscosity of the suspension, rate of deposition, pressure applied \n\non the screen, among other experimental variables.[21]  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n1.5.2 The Electrophoretic Deposition \n\nAnother thick film processing technique is the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) that \n\nutilizes a colloidal suspension of ceramic powders. The deposition by electrophoresis combines \n\ntwo processes: electrophoresis itself, in which the charged particles suspended in the solution \n\nmove under the influence of an electric field (Figure 11) and, in a dc field, this motion results in \n\nthe particle accumulation near the oppositely charged electrode; the deposited particles are \n\nattached by van der Waals forces or by chemical bonds and thus constitute a consolidated \n\nlayer, forming a solid deposit. This particulate deposit can then be densified by a sintering step \n\nand form structures suitable for many applications.[24]  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11: Schematic representation of the Electrophoretic Deposition process. After \n\nsintering, the coating densifies and becomes useful for example for piezoelectric applications.[25] \n\n \n\nSuccessful EPD requires the development of stable suspensions composed of \n\nelectrostatically charged particles suspended in a suitable solvent where specific mechanisms \n\nare active keeping the particles from flocculating or agglomerating.[26]  \n\nAmong thick film production processes electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technology \n\npossesses a set of unique advantages. EPD is very versatile since it can be modified easily for \n\na specific application. For example, deposition can be made on flat, cylindrical or any other \n\nshaped substrate with only minor changes in the electrode design and positioning. In principle, \n\nEPD can be applied to any solid and any material class that is available in the form of a fine \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\npowder or a colloidal suspension including metals, polymers, carbides, oxides, nitrides and \n\nglasses.[26] \n\nDespite being a wet process, EPD offers easy control of the thickness and morphology of \n\na deposited film through simple adjustment of the deposition time and applied potential.[26] The \n\ninterest in the EPD technique is based not only on its high versatility to be used with different \n\nmaterials and combinations of materials but also because EPD is a cost-effective method \n\nusually requiring simple equipment. With EPD, particulate deposits can be made in seconds on \n\nsuitable surfaces of planar or more complex geometry. Moreover EPD has high potential for \n\nbeing scaled up to large product volumes and sizes, as well as to a variety of product shapes \n\nand 3D complex structures.[26]  \n\n EPD has been quite investigated in the fabrication of high performance functional \n\nthick/thin films, such as (Ba,Sr)TiO3,\n[16] BaTiO3,\n\n[13] Pb(Zr,Ti)O3,\n[29] and more recently in the \n\nmanufacturing of thick films for high frequencies, such as BaO-Ln2O3-TiO2,\n[29], [27] and tellurium \n\nbased compositions (such as TiTe3O8).\n[30]  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n1.6 Current Demands for Piezoelectrics and Ferroelectrics \n\n \n\n1.6.1 Miniaturization and Low Processing Costs \n\nAdvanced functional components are made of materials systems rather than of discrete \n\nmaterials, therefore integration issues increase in importance. This is particularly true in \n\nminiaturized systems where interfaces play a very important role. Integration issues comprise \n\nboth the integration of electroceramics thin films with the substrates and the semiconductor \n\nchips as well as the combination of bulk ceramics for different kinds and/or other materials such \n\nas metals, glass or polymers to form compound devices.[19] \n\nThe key words associated with the current trends of microelectronic industry are: \n\nminiaturization, optimal performance, high integration and low costs (as alleged ahead of). [3] \n\nMiniaturization of systems such as planar circuits, antennas, filters and couplers are an example \n\nof a requirement and because of that it has been the driving force for the search for fabrication \n\nprocesses for mass-produced dielectric films with repeatable performance at low costs. Indeed, \n\nthe advances attained over the recent years in thick-film technology have permitted this \n\ninexpensive process to become significantly useful in electronics manufacturing.[20] \n\nThe growing need of the microelectronics industry for small, lightweight, multifunctional \n\ndevices that use less battery power and have low manufacturing costs has also been the driving \n\nforce behind the search for optimized materials. Thick films of materials with improved \n\nproperties and capable of fabrication at low temperatures to replace the currently used bulk \n\ndielectric components are presently of paramount importance.[30] \n\n The manufacturing of ferroelectric films on metal foils is an important mission for devices \n\nintegrated into electronic packaging, an approach that is currently receiving considerable \n\nattention due to cost and space advantages. One of the significant costs in the manufacture of \n\nelectroceramics is the energy consumed during thermal processing. The other one is \n\nassociated with the high price of the substrates (Si based) and under layers (noble metals). \n\nFrom this perspective low sintering temperatures for the materials are desirable.[31] \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n1.6.2 Processing Compatibility with Metals \n\nBase metals are commercially attractive because of their low cost and simple \n\npatternability. However their compatibility with the current fabrication techniques of functional \n\nmaterials is difficult and sometimes impossible.  \n\n \n\nTable 3: Physical properties for some of the metals used as electrode materials.[32] \n\n \n\nPhysical Properties Copper Gold Platinum Aluminium Nickel \n\nDensity (g/cm\n-3\n) 8.94 19.30 21.45 2.70 8.91 \n\nLiquid density (g/cm\n-3\n) 8.02 17.31 19.77 2.38 7.81 \n\nMelting Point (\u00baC) 1085 1064 1768 660 1453 \n\nBoiling Point (\u00baC) 2562 2856 3825 2519 2732 \n\nHeat of fusion (kJ mol\n-1\n) 13.26 12.55 22.17 10.71 17.47 \n\nHeat of vaporization \n\n(kJmol\n-1\n) \n\n300.4 324 469 294 377.46 \n\nSpecific heat capacity  \n\n(25\u00baC) (Jmol\n-1\nK\n-1\n) \n\n24.44 25.42 25.86 26.20 26.07 \n\nElectrical  conductivity \n\n(20\u00baC) (Sm\n-1\n) \n\n59.6x106 45.2x106 9.66x106 37.8x106 14.3x106 \n\n \n\nCopper presents an excellent electrical conductivity, as referred in Table 3, and has \n\nextensive use as an electrical and heat conductor, as a building material and as a component of \n\nvarious alloys. Copper does not react with water (H2O). Instead it reacts slowly at room \n\ntemperature with the oxygen from air to form a layer of copper oxide on copper metal. \n\nCu foils with thickness of several tens of micrometers are attractive substrates for thin \n\nand thick ferroelectric film deposition due to its low cost and high conductivity. The deposition of \n\na high-permittivity material on Cu is promising for embedded capacitor applications in printed \n\nwiring boards (PWBs). Besides cost reduction, the required wiring board area is greatly reduced \n\nby replacing the surface - mount components with pre-embedded capacitive layers. This offers \n\nindeed advantages for electronic miniaturization.[33] \n\nCompared to platinum, which is widely used as an electrode material in many oxide thin-\n\nfilm devices, the low cost and high conductivity of Cu makes it a promising candidate to replace \n\nPt for non-volatile ferroelectric memories, other ferroelectric, complex oxide thin and thick film-\n\nbased devices (as is demonstrated in Table 2). However, the utilization of Cu foils as substrates \n\nfor films poses several important problems. Cu is easily oxidized at high temperatures and the \n\noxygen partial pressure (pO2) needs to be controlled to avoid oxidation of Cu. Moreover, \n\nferroelectric films usually need to be annealed at high temperatures in oxygen atmosphere to \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nobtain the desired crystalline phase. Hence, success depends on finding deposition conditions \n\nthat fulfil both requirements.[34] \n\nThe successful use of Cu foils as substrates for the preparation of ferroelectric lead \n\nbased and lead-free thin films have been reported by some authors.[32, 33] BaTiO3 thin films with \n\nhigh dielectric permittivity have been deposited by sol-gel technique directly on Cu foils for \n\nembedded component applications. Cu foils were also used for the preparation of sputtered \n\nBa1-xSrxTiO3 (BST) thin films for tunable capacitors for radio frequency/microwave applications. \n\nThe feasibility of the preparation of sol\u2013gel-derived Ba1-xZrxTiO3 (BZT) thin films on Cu foils was \n\nalso recently demonstrated for tunable capacitors with radio frequency/microwave \n\napplications.[12] High-resolution TEM cross-section microscopy studies of these films revealed \n\nno interfacial reactions. According to the authors, the success in the preparation of BaTiO3 \n\nbased capacitors on Cu is related to the very low oxygen partial pressures required to reduce \n\nTiO2 and BaO, compatible with the conditions under which Cu oxidizes. However, a different \n\nsituation occurs for Pb-based systems. Due to the tendency of PbO to reduce at higher oxygen \n\npartial pressures than BaO, the processing window of PbO based films on Cu foils is \n\ncomparatively narrow. Two approaches have been reported to avoid the oxidation of Cu. The \n\nfirst approach involves the use of a Ni/Ni phosphide interface layer between the Cu foil and the \n\nPb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) and PLZT films. High-resolution cross-section microscopy studies revealed \n\nthe formation of a NiO layer[34] and consequently, a linear dielectric capacitor with a reduced \n\ncapacitance density was obtained. Although useful for embedded capacitors, this solution is not \n\nsuitable when higher dielectric permittivity responses are required. The alternative approach \n\ninvolves the control of pO2 within a narrow processing window predicted by thermodynamics. \n\nHigh quality sol\u2013gel-derived PZT thin films deposited directly on Cu foils with an accompanying \n\nferroelectric fatigue resistance were reported.[34] Within that window the stability of Cu against \n\noxidation is compatible with the stability of PZT against reduction. Generally, the annealing \n\ntemperature for sol\u2013gel PZT thin films on Cu does not exceed 700\u00baC. However, for thick films \n\ndeposited on Cu, a much higher temperature is required to achieve sintering of the PZT \n\nparticles. Hence, besides oxidation, problems such as diffusion, adhesion and interaction \n\nbetween film and substrate at such a temperature are envisaged. \n\nFrom the phase diagram of the Cu\u2013Pb binary system, there also exists a eutectic point \n\nabove 955\u00baC (Figure 12). It is considered therefore that this may also be a critical temperature \n\nin the processing of thick films containing Pb. The copper-lead phase diagram has a eutectic \n\npoint at 326 \u00baC for 99.94 % Pb and as a result terminal solid solutions of most pure lead (0.007 \n\n% Cu) and pure copper (0.005 % Pb) are formed at room temperature.[35] There are three \n\nimportant parts to consider: (1) the liquid that is miscible in all proportions at higher \n\ntemperatures, but develops a miscibility gap below about 1000\u00baC; (2) the face-centered cubic \n\n(fcc) solid solution (Cu), with very limited solubility of Pb, and (3) the fcc solid solution (Pb), with \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\npresumably negligible solubility of Cu.[36] The most important feature of this diagram is the \n\nmonotetic invariant reaction at 46 % Pb and 955\u00baC. At the monothetic point (100% Cu), L1 \n\n(46% Pb) and L2 (87% Pb) can coexist. Copper and lead are essentially insoluble in each \n\nother.[37] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12: Phase diagram of the Cu\u2013Pb binary system.[37] \n\n \n\nPrevious studies on the manufacture of thick PZT films on Cu by electrophoretic \n\ndeposition (EPD) have shown, for the films sintered under a nitrogen based atmosphere at 950-\n\n1000 \u00baC with controlled pO2, the formation of a Pb-Cu alloy at the Cu /PZT interface which \n\nmigrates into the bulk of the film causing the PZT decomposition into ZrO2 and lead titanate \n\n(PT) rich PZT. The dielectric permittivity and remanent polarization responses are consequently \n\ndeteriorated when compared with the properties of PZT thick films deposited on inert metal foils, \n\nsuch as, Pt. These studies clearly point to the need to decrease the sintering temperature of \n\nPZT thick films on Cu.[4]  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n1.6.3 Sintering Aids \n\nAs well explained above, because of the need of expensive electrode materials such as \n\nplatinum and palladium in many co-fired multilayer devices, imposed by the high sintering \n\ntemperatures and the environmental concerns over PbO volatilization at these temperatures, \n\nmuch attention has been paid at reducing the sintering temperature of a wide range of \n\nelectroceramics products such as barium titanate (BT) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT). \n\nSintering ceramics at low temperature has been done by using for example liquid phase \n\nadditives. Liquid phase sintering aids melt below the sintering temperature. Ideally, the sintering \n\naid should be chosen so that the ceramic particles are both wetted by, and practically soluble in \n\nit. Wetting of the particles by the liquid, results in curved liquid meniscus surfaces on witch \n\ncapillarity forces act tending to drown the particles together. When solubility of the solid occurs, \n\na higher diffusivity into the liquid may increase the rate of mass transport and shrinkage. \n\nPorosity is also reduced by residual liquid filling the pores.[26]  \n\nFor BT, PbO\u2013B2O3 and Bi2O3\u2013B2O3 glass sintering aids have been commonly utilized.\n[31] \n\nFor the case of PbTiO3 ceramics it has been demonstrated that borate- and silicate-based \n\nglasses which contain a high mol% of TiO2 and PbO act well as sintering aids. \n\nThe most studied additives for PZT have been: Pb5Ge3O11, PbO-B2O3, B2O3\u2013Bi2O3\u2014\n\nCdO, PbO- Cu2O, Li2CO3\u2013Bi2O3 and borate- and silicate-based glasses.\n[4] Literature also refers \n\nthe use of low melting oxides such as V2O5 and glass frits. The addition of glass frit enhanced \n\ndensity significantly to ~92% of the theoretical density, due to the low melting of the glass frit \n\nwhich helps densification during the initial and intermediate stages of the sintering. [1] However, \n\ndeteriorating effects on the piezoelectric and dielectric properties were reported. \n\nFrom the phase diagram of PbO-B2O3 (Figure 13) several eutectic points at low \n\ntemperatures can be identified, making these compositions suitable to be used as sintering \n\naids. Indeed, in some works 4PbO\u00b7B2O3 frit was added because of its low melting temperature \n\nand high polarizability, which was helpful to the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the \n\nsystem. If small amounts of 4PbO\u00b7B2O3 glass powder are added to the calcined PZT ceramics, \n\nthe formed liquid phase increases the surface diffusion and enhances the grain growth during \n\nsintering. Hence, the sintering temperature can be reduced and the piezoelectric and dielectric \n\nproperties are enhanced.[38]  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 13: Phase diagram of PbO \u2013 B2O3 binary system.\n[39] \n\n \n\n \n\nThe products of reaction between PZT and PbO-B2O3 glasses at 850\u00b0C were studied \n\nusing powder and bulk PZT samples.[39] The use of this additive has not been reported yet in \n\nPZT thick films. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n2. Objective of the Thesis  \n\nAs stated in the previous chapter, piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate ceramics find \n\ncurrently numerous applications. In some of these applications, noble metals such as platinum \n\nand palladium are used as internal electrodes; for applications in which the ceramic is cofired \n\nwith the metallic electrode low cost based electrodes such as silver, nickel and copper, among \n\nothers, cannot be used due to their low melting points as compared to the sintering \n\ntemperatures commonly employed for PZT. The use of these expensive metals adds significant \n\ncosts to the components. This issue becomes even more relevant when there is the need to \n\nembed capacitors into the circuit. It is then imperative to lower the sintering temperature of the \n\nelectroceramics and to make it compatible with low cost based metals. Concomitantly, sintering \n\nat low temperatures also brings other benefits, as well, regarding the reduced power \n\nconsumption and lead losses during sintering thereby contributing for a better environment.[3]  \n\n \n\nWithin this context, the topic of this work is related with the preparation of PZT thick films \n\non flexible copper substrates for embedded circuit applications. And the main objective of this \n\nstudy is to decrease the sintering temperature of thick PZT films to make them compatible with \n\nthe use of Cu substrates and concomitantly to improve the film quality and dielectric \n\nperformance. One way of doing this is through the use of sintering aids. By adding a \n\ncommercial glass powder and mixtures of PbO and B2O3 with different ratios, as sintering aids, \n\na systematic study of the preparation and properties of PZT thick films on Cu is undertaken.  \n\nAnother important objective is to lower the fabrication costs of thick films to add value in \n\nterms of commercialization. Within this context electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method is \n\nexploited for the fabrication of these thick films and the processing conditions such as voltage, \n\ndeposition time and suspension composition are studied in order to fabricate high-quality and \n\nreproducible coatings on the conductive substrates utilising a commercially available PZT \n\npowder.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n3. Experimental Procedure \n\nIn this work PZT thick films were fabricated by EPD on Cu metallic foils. In order to \n\ndecrease the sintering temperature of the films, the effect of sintering aids was addressed. The \n\nsintering aids used were a lead containing-borosilicate glass and a mixture of boron oxide and \n\nlead oxide. Lead oxide is a glass former with low melting point (phase diagram, Figure 12), \n\nwhich will help to decrease the sintering temperature of PZT. B2O3, as V2O5, is also a low \n\nmelting point oxide and a glass former one. \n\nThe obtained results were compared with previous ones reported within this group for a \n\nmixture of PbO and V2O5.\n[45] \n\nThe next table indicates the various compositions studied in this thesis. \n\n \n\nTable 4: Compositions prepared in this work and sintering conditions used for the \n\ndensification of the films. The glass composition corresponds to SiO2, PbO, Al2O3, B2O3 \n\n(commercial glass).

Glacial acetic acid was reported to improve \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nthe electric properties of thick films prepared by EPD over aqueous and alcoholic media on \n\nplatinised alumina substrate.[24] \n\n A commercial borosilicate glass powder, Glass Powder 8465, manufactured by Schott \n\nElectronic Packaging was used in this study. Its transformation temperature is 385\u00baC and the \n\ndielectric constant of this glass is 15 and loss tangent is 0.0027. The glass powder 8465 was \n\nadded to PZT in the amounts of 5, 10 and 20 weight percent (wt %) of PZT. PZT and glass \n\npowders were milled separately in acetone during 6 hours. The final particle size of 0,377 \u00b5m \n\nfor PZT and 5,12 \u00b5m for Glass was determined by Coulter LS230 Instrument (Coulter LS 230, \n\nCoulter Electronic Limited, Luton, U.K.), \n\nLead oxide (Panreac, 99%) and boron oxide B2O3 (commercial oxide) were used for the \n\nsecond set of compositions. The particle size of these oxides was also assessed by the Coulter \n\nLS230 Instrument. \n\nThe mixture of PZT powders with sintering aids (glass or oxide powders) were \n\nultrasonically mixed and dispersed in glacial acetic acid (Pronalab, 100%, Lisbon, Portugal) to \n\nform a suspension with a concentration of 3 wt % of PZT in acetic acid. \n\nIn this work, an electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) spectrophotometer (Delsa-440 SX, \n\nBeckman Coulter, Inc., USA) was used to determine the zeta potential of the PZT suspensions. \n\nFor that, a sample is typically placed in a disposable plastic cuvette and platinum electrodes \n\ninserted. The entire cell is placed into the internal chamber of Delsa 440 SX and the \n\nmeasurement automatically conducted. \n\nAs it is well know, the dispersability of the glass powders in suspension is very difficult \n\nand because of that two one dispersant was used in this work. Commercial Dispex A 40 \n\n(0,01g/mL) was used in the amount of 5 wt % and 5 - 7.5 wt % of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) \n\n(commercial product), was used as binder, added to a 10 and 20 wt % of glass suspension. \n\nElectrophoretic deposition was carried out in optimized conditions through varying the \n\ncurrent, voltage and time of deposition.

Right dispositive: voltage supply.[Adapted from reference 40] \n\n \n\nThe distance between the metal foil cathode and the stainless-steel anode was kept at 2 \n\ncm. A dc voltage supply (Glassman High Voltage Inc., Portugal) was used to generate the dc \n\nvoltage required for the deposition, ranging from 200 to 400 V. \n\n Prior to each EPD cycle the suspensions were ultrasonically dispersed and magnetically \n\nstirred for 5 and 10 min, respectively, followed by settling for 0,5 min in order to sediment the \n\ncoarse particles. \n\nTo fabricate >1\u00b5m thick films for which the properties are shown below, the suspension \n\nwas sonicated for 10 min and the deposition was carried out over 0.5 min at 200V. \n\nA mask with 10 mm diameter hole in centre (Figure 15 illustrates the mask with 10 mm \n\ndiameter in centre) was used for the deposition. The metal foil substrate (Cu) used for film \n\ndeposition was hold between the stainless steel and the mask.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15: Cell for electrophoretic deposition showing the mask with a 10 mm diameter \n\nhole in the centre.[Adapted from reference 40] \n\n \n\nIn previously works at this group it was observed that the rate of formation of the \n\nconsolidated layer during EPD is directly proportional to the amount of charge that passed \n\nthrough the cell. When EPD is operated under constant current conditions, the deposited weight \n\nincreases linearly with time. However, in order to maintain constant-current conditions, the \n\nvoltage has to be continuously increased as the deposit induces an increased electrical \n\nresistance to the system. Under constant-voltage conditions, the potential between the \n\nelectrodes is maintained constant, which thus results in a decreased deposition rate as the \n\ndeposit builds up.[42] \n\nAfter deposition, the obtained films were dried at room temperature overnight. The dried \n\nfilms were isostatically pressed at 2000 kg/cm2 during five minutes. The films were then sintered \n\nbetween 800 and 900 \u00baC under a low oxygen partial pressure (pO2) (between 5 x 10\n-5 and 8 x \n\n10-7 atm), during 30 to 60 minutes. \n\nThe thickness of the films was estimated by a Micrometer, and the structure and phase \n\nassembly were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku, \u2018\u2018Geigerflex\u2019\u2019 D/Max- B, Tokyo, \n\nJapan) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA, scanned from 20\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 with a scan speed of 1\u00b0/ min and \n\nstep interval 0.02\u00b0 using Cu K radiation with a wavelength of ?=1.5406 \u00c5. The microstructure of \n\nthe films was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4100, Japan) \n\noperated at 20 kV. \n\nDielectric properties (dielectric permittivity and loss) were obtained using an HP 4284A \n\nprecision LCR meter, measuring 5 dots for each condition. \n\nCapacitance\u2013voltage dependence was measured with a Keithley current/voltage source \n\nmeter. Before the measurements, gold (Au) top electrodes were sputtered onto the thick films \n\nthrough a shadow mask. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n4. Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n4.1 Characterization of the Precursor Powders and Suspensions \n\nAs mentioned before, there are three basic steps in EPD: formation of a stable \n\nsuspension of the particles, electrophoretic migration of the particles to the opposite electrode, \n\nand deposition of the particles in the desired arrangement on the electrode surface. First step \n\nincludes the preparation of a stable suspension in which the particles can move independently. \n\nIn the second step a DC electric field is applied to the suspension causing the electrophoretic \n\nmotion of charged particles toward the oppositely charged electrode. In the final step the inter-\n\nparticle repulsion forces that keep the particles stably suspended must be overcome. EPD is \n\npurely a method of moving and arranging particles. To produce a dense mechanically strong \n\nlayer or object it must be combined with some other process such as sintering and, sometimes \n\na pre-sintering isostatic pressing step to eliminate the pores between the particles and to \n\ndensify the film.[41]  \n\n EPD should not be confused with electrodeposition, here ions are deposited and \n\ndischarged at the electrode. EPD requires colloidal stable suspensions where the particles carry \n\na substantial charge. There are several suspension and dispersant media that can be used in \n\nEPD, that include aqueous, organic, acid and basis. Although aqueous media are important \n\nfrom the point of view of costs and environmental issues, due to electrolysis that tend to occur in \n\nwater based suspensions under an electric field, which causes bubbles and pores in the \n\ndeposited layer, aqueous media is seldom used. Although electrostatic stabilization is \n\nconsidered most effective in aqueous medium, a substantial surface charge density \u2013 with the \n\nassociated countering layer in solution \u2013 can also be created in organic and other suspension \n\nmedia, through the use of special additives. This is the case of the present work. \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Particle Size Distribution \n\n Another important aspect that accounts for the stability of the suspension is the particle \n\nsize. The particle size distribution of glass before and after milling and with and without Dispex \n\nis presented in the next graph (Figure 16). The curve of the glass particles without milling is \n\ncharacterised by three main peaks and the average particle size is 8.28 \u00b5m. After milling a \n\nbimodal curve was obtained with an average particle size of 3.58 \u00b5m. The dispersant effect of \n\nDispex is not obvious, since similar results were obtained for dispersed and non dispersed \n\nsuspension and the average particle size is 3.48 \u00b5m. This observation allowed us to conclude \n\nthat Dispex was not effective in dispersing the glass particles. \n\nConcerning the PZT powders, the particle size distribution illustrated in Figure 17 reveals \n\na bimodal distribution with a first major peak in the submicron region (peak at 0.2 \u00b5m) and a \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nsecond one peaking at 1.7 \u00b5m that might correspond to some particle agglomerates. The \n\naverage particle size is 0.414 \u00b5m. The addition of Dispex is not particularly effective in removing \n\nthe second peak and only a very subtle increase of the volume % of the finer particles is \n\nobserved. For this last case the average particle size is 0.337\u00b5m. Combined with SEM \n\nobservations (Figure 18 and 19), it is believed that the two peaks reveal a weak and stronger \n\nagglomeration of the original particle size, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 16: Particle size distribution of Glass particles before and after milling and with \n\nand without Dispex. \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n0.04 0.258 1.669 10.78 69.62 449.7\n\nV\no\nlu\n\nm\ne\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nParticle Size (\u00b5m)\n\nGlass after milling with dispex\n\nGlass after milling\n\nGlass before milling\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0.04 0.258 1.669 10.78 69.62 449.7\n\nV\no\nlu\nm\ne\n %\n\nParticle Size (\u00b5m)\n\nPZT\n\nPZT with Dispex\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17: Particle size distribution of Lead Zirconate Titanate powders with and without \n\nDispex. \n\n  \n\nThe morphology of the PZT powders was analysed by SEM and the micrographs are \n\npresented in Figure 18, in which individual PZT particles (Figure 18) and agglomerates (Figure \n\n19) can be identified, corroborating the particle size distribution analysis. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18: SEM morphology of PZT green powders. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19: SEM morphology of PZT green powders. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Zeta Potential \n\n \n\n4.1.2.1 Brief Introduction to Zeta Potential \n\nColloidal particles dispersed in a solution are electrically charged due to their ionic \n\ncharacteristics and dipolar attributes. In such a suspension each particle is surrounded by a \n\nlayer of oppositely charged ions called the Stern layer. Outside the Stern layer, there are ions of \n\nopposite polarities which concentration varies, forming a cloud-like volume. This volume is \n\ncalled the diffuse double layer, and the whole volume is electrically neutral.[43] \n\nWhen a voltage is applied to the solution in which particles are dispersed, particles are \n\nattracted to the electrode of the opposite polarity, accompanied by the fixed layer and part of the \n\ndiffuse double layer, usually called as the \"sliding surface\" (Figure 20). \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 20: Movement of charged particles under the electric field.[Adapted from reference 43] \n\n \n \n\n \n\nIn the double layer model, the Zeta potential is considered to be the electric potential of \n\nthis inner volume including this conceptual \"sliding surface\". As this electric potential \n\napproaches zero, particles tend to aggregate. \n\nThe static layer is computed using the following formula.[Adapted from reference 43] \n\n \n\n??? ? ?13 ? 128??\n \n  \n\nK = (Width of Cell)/(Thickness of Cell) \n\nb = A half of Thickness of Cell \n\nhs = Static Layer (Distance from center of Cell) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\nZeta Potential (Smoluchowski\u2019s Formula)  \n\n? ? 4??? ? ? ? 300 ? 300 ? 1000 \n\n?=Zeta Potencial (mV) \n\n? = Viscosity of Solution \n\n? = Dielectric Constant \n\n? ? ??/? \nEletrophoretic Mobility \n\n? = Speed of Particle (m/sec) \n\nV = Voltage (V) \n\nL = The distance between \neletrodes \n\n \nTo eliminate errors due to electroosmotic flow caused by any electrostatic charge on the \n\nmeasurement cell, the zeta potential is measured at the static layer, whose position can be \n\ncalculated from the width and depth of the cell (the software performs this calculation \n\nautomatically). \n\nSome considerations to have in mind that are important for EPD: \n\n\u2022 The magnitude of the zeta potential gives an indication of the potential stability of the \n\ncolloidal system; \n\n\u2022 If all the particles have a large negative or positive zeta potential they will repel each \n\nother and there is a dispersion stability; \n\n\u2022 If the particles have low zeta potential values then there is no force to prevent the \n\nparticles coming together and there is a dispersion instability; \n\n\u2022 A dividing line between stable and unstable dispersions is generally taken at either +30 \n\nor -30mV (Figure 21), being suspensions with zeta potentials > +30mV or &lt;-30mV normally \n\nconsidered stable. \n\nPositive Zeta potential \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..+30mV \n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u20260mV \n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. -30mV \n\n \n\n \n\nNegative Zeta potential \n\n \n\nFigure 21: Zeta Potential Stable Zone.[Adapted from reference 44] \n\nStable \n\nNot Stable \n\nStable \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\n \n\nTo guarantee the required suspension stability and a constant flow of particles under the \n\napplied electric field, during EPD, zeta potential curves are a good indicator of the surface \n\ncharges and stability of the suspensions. Meanwhile, zeta potential sign (positive or negative) \n\ndetermines the direction and migration velocity of the powder particles during EPD. Moreover, \n\nbecause high green densities are required for these thick films a very well dispersed suspension \n\nis needed. It is then crucial to maximize the repulsive forces between the particles to prevent \n\ntheir coagulation and consequent flocculation that will markedly affect the quality of the \n\ndeposited films. \n\nThe surface charge of these PZT suspensions was analyzed by zeta-potential \n\nmeasurements and the zeta potential of PZT powders dispersed in Potassium Chloride (KCl) as \n\na function of pH is depicted in Figure 22. At low pH, PZT is positively charged and presents a \n\nquite high zeta potential value, > +30 mV, indicating its suitability for electrophoretic deposition; \n\nunder an electric field the powders will be deposited onto the cathode. As the pH value \n\nincreases zeta potential decreases being zero (isoelectric point) for pH ? 10.15 and then the \n\nnegative surface charges increase for higher pH values.  \n\nThe zeta potential behaviour of the glass and oxide powders was analysed as well. The \n\nzeta potential curve for unmilled and milled glass is plotted in Figure 23. Similarly to the \n\nprevious curve, the zeta potential of glass powders decreases as pH increases with an \n\nisoelectric point for pH ? 10.15 for glass before milled and pH ? 10.9 for glass after milled. For \n\nlow pH values the zeta potential is around +30 mV, suggesting a good compatibility with PZT \n\npowders in terms of suspension stability towards an effective EPD. In accordance with the \n\nparticle size distribution, milled glasses present slightly higher zeta potential values.  \n\nBased on these results of zeta potential, suspensions of the films in this work were \n\nprepared in acetic acid media and under a pH value &lt;5, and a cathodic EPD took place.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22: Zeta potential of Lead Zirconate Titanate powders in Potassium \n\nChloride based suspension media. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 23: Zeta Potential of a Glass after and before milling in Potassium Chloride \n\nbased suspension media. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13\n\nZ\ne\nta\n P\no\nte\nn\nc\nia\nl \n(m\nV\n)\n\npH\n\nGlass before milling\n\nGlass after milling\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14Z\ne\nta\n P\no\nte\nn\nti\na\nl \n(m\nV\n)\n\npH\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24: Zeta potential of Lead Oxide in Potassium Chloride based suspension media. \n\n  \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n\nZ\ne\nta\n P\no\nte\nn\nti\na\nl \n(m\nV\n)\n\npH \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n4.2 Characterization of the Films \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Structure and Phase Analysis \n\nThe XRD patterns of sintered PZT films with addition of 5 wt % Glass additions deposited \n\non Cu are depicted in Figure 25. The crystalline phases present in the film after sintering at \n\n800\u00baC for 30 minutes are PZT, ZrO2, Cu, PbO, and PbTiO3. To be noted here is the high \n\nintensity of the Cu peaks, what may related with the low thickness of the films deposited with \n\nglass addition. Similar phases were identified for the films sintered with the other glass contents \n\nand at different temperatures. No significant changes were observed and no phases resulting \n\nfrom the reaction of the glass with PZT or with Cu were observed.  \n\nAll this bad results for formed crystalline phases, the appearance of second phases and \n\ndominant phases being copper were probably the reason for such bad results on dielectric \n\nproperties and the abandonment of these compositions for deposition of these films with glass \n\naddition.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 25: XRD patterns of PZT films with PZT with 5 wt % of Glass, sintered at 800\u00baC \n\nfor 30 minutes. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nThe XRD patterns of sintered PZT films with B2O3 + PbO on Cu are represented in \n\nFigures 26, 27, 28 and 29. \n\nFigure 26 depicts the XRD patterns of PZT films with 1 wt % of (90% B2O3 and 10% \n\nPbO) and sintered at 800\u00baC and 900\u00baC for 30 and 60 minutes. For the low sintering \n\ntemperatures (800\u00baC) three crystalline phases were identified as PZT, PbO and Cu, being PZT \n\nthe dominant phase. The presence of PbO in these films is related with the used additives. The \n\nabsence of boron based crystalline phases should be related with the glass formation character \n\nof boron oxide, implying an effectiveness of the role of PbO \u2013 B2O3 additions as sintering aid. \n\nImportant to note here is the nonappearance of any cuprite phase, resulting from the oxidation \n\nof the Cu substrate, what indicates that the used reducing atmosphere was effective in \n\npreventing the oxidation of the substrate, at least under the current XRD detection limit. As the \n\nsintering temperature increases to 900\u00baC besides the phases previously detected, peaks \n\ncorresponding to Pb and ZrO2 were identified as well. This may be due to a reaction between \n\nPZT and Cu leading to the separation of the PZT with the formation of lead oxide and zirconium \n\noxide, and as a consequence may degrade the electrical response of these films. Another \n\nindication of the degradation of PZT is that the intensity of the peaks correspondent to PZT \n\ndecreased as the sintering temperature increases to 900\u00baC. Indeed in a previous work [4] for \n\nPZT films deposited on Cu foils and sintered at temperatures higher than 950 \u00baC ZrO2 was \n\ndetected as well. [34] It was then postulated that the formation of a Cux-Pb when sintering above \n\n950 \u00b0C caused the decomposition PZT accompanied by the Ti enrichment of PZT and formation \n\nof ZrO2. \n[4] \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nIn\nte\nn\ns\nit\ny\n (\nC\nP\nS\n)\n\nTwo Theta (deg)\n\n800\u00baC, 30min,90%B2O3,10%PbO\n\n900\u00baC, 60min, 90%B2O3+10%PbO\n\nPbZr0,58Ti0,42O3 - Lead Zirconium Titanium oxide\nPbO - Lead Oxide\nCu - Copper \nPb - Lead\nZrO2 - Zirconium oxide\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nFigure 26: XRD patterns for PZT films with 1 wt % of (90% B2O3 and 10% PbO) sintered \n\nat 800\u00baC and 900\u00baC for 30 and 60 minutes. \n\nThe XRD patterns plotted in next figure (Figure 27) correspond to the PZT films with 1 wt \n\n% of (80% B2O3 and 20% PbO) sintered at 800\u00baC and 900\u00baC for 30 and 60 minutes. Similarly to \n\nthe previous films, for the low sintering temperature only the phases corresponding to PZT, PbO \n\nand Cu were detected.

The crystalline phases identified in \n\nthese films are the same as in the two previous cases: PZT, Cu and PbO for the films sintered \n\nat 800 \u00baC and plus ZrO2 and Pb for the films sintered at 900\u00baC. In this case the intensity of the \n\nPZT degrades as well with the sintering temperature. \n\nFrom the above XRD results there are no obvious differences in terms of phases formed \n\nand in terms of crystallinity (inferred by peaks intensity) between the PZT films prepared with \n\ndifferent B2O3 + PbO proportions. For all of the studied oxide mixtures the highest sintering \n\ntemperature (900\u00baC) promotes reactions with the substrate and the formation of secondary \n\nphases. Due to the excess of PbO used as sintering aid, residual PbO is present in these films. \n\nIn terms of phase formation the low sintering temperature of 800 \u00baC corresponds to the most \n\nadequate situation in terms of formed phases. \n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n8000\n\n9000\n\n10000\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nIn\nte\nn\ns\nit\ny\n (\nC\nP\nS\n)\n\nTwo Theta (deg)\n\n800\u00baC,30min,80%B2O3+20%PbO\n\n900\u00baC,60min, 80%B2O3+20%PbO\n\nPbZr0,58Ti0,42O3 - Lead Zirconium Titanium \nOxide\nPbO - Lead oxide \nCu-Copper\nPb - Lead\nZrO2 - Zirconium Oxide\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nIn\nte\nn\ns\nit\ny\n (\nC\nP\nS\n)\n\nTwo Theta (deg)\n\n800\u00baC,30min,50%B2O3 + 50%PbO\n\n900\u00baC,60min,50%B2O3 + 50%PbO\n\nPbZr0,58Ti0,42O3 - Lead Zirconium \nOxide\nPbO - Lead Oxide\nCu - Copper\nPb - Lead\nZrO2 - Zirconium Oxide\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 28: XRD patterns of PZT films with 1 wt % of (50% B2O3  and 50% PbO) sintered \n\nat 800\u00baC and 900\u00baC for 30 and 60 minutes. \n\n \n\n \n\nXRD patterns of PZT films with 3 wt % (50% B2O3 + 50% PbO) sintered at 800\u00baC for 30 \n\nminutes are plotted in Figure 29.

Thin and fluffy layers with irregular edges and surfaces cover some parts of the \n\nsubstrate for films prepared from PZT and glass powders suspensions. In these cases the film \n\nthickness was not uniform and in some cases it was even impossible to have a continuous layer \n\nof powder on the surface of the substrate. These observations support very well the XRD \n\nresults obtained for these films (Figure 25). It is then expected that for some of these films the \n\nability to measure the dielectric properties will be difficult. \n\nOn the other hand conformal and uniform PZT films were obtained for the films with \n\noxides additions.

However the film microstructure is not very dense and, as depicted in the high \n\nmagnification micrograph the grains are loosely packed. The cross section micrograph of these \n\nfilms (Figure 32 c)) indicates that the thickness of these films is around 10 \u00b5m, the surface is \n\nquite smooth, the grains are very fine and the porosity is clearly seen.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na) \n\n \n\n \n\nb) \n\nFigure 31: Microstructure of PZT green films with 1 wt % addition of (50% B2O3 and 50% \n\nPbO); a) low magnification, b) cross section. \n\n \n\nSubstrate \n\nFilm \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nb) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nc) \n\n \n\nFigure 32: Microstructure of PZT films with 1 wt % addition of (50% B2O3 and 50% PbO) \n\nsintered at 800\u00baC and 30 minutes; a) low magnification, b) high magnification and c) cross \n\nsection. \n\n \n\nThe next micrographs correspond to films of PZT with 1wt % of (80% B2O3 and 20% \n\nPbO) and 1 wt% of (90% B2O3 and 10% PbO) sintered at high temperatures, 900\u00baC for 60 \n\nminutes.

For very low frequencies, as the frequency increases the \n\ndielectric permittivity slightly decreases, keeping almost constant until 381 at 1 kHz. Similar \n\nbehaviour is observed for the losses. The dielectric permittivity ranges from 50 to 350 and the \n\nlosses from 0.05 to almost 2. In comparison with the values obtained in this work for the other \n\nPZT films and reported in the literature this range of permittivity values is quite low [1], [4], [39]  \n\nAs it can be seen there is no consistent variation of the dielectric response with the \n\nsintering cycle.

As the sintering temperature \n\nincreases the permittivity decreases. A similar statement holds for the effect of the sintering \n\ntime: higher permittivities were measured for the films sintered for 30 minutes against films \n\nsintered for 60 minutes. The dielectric response of the films corroborates well the observations \n\nof the phase analysis (Figures 26 to 28). Prolonged sintering time or high sintering temperatures \n\nfavoured the reaction between PZT and Cu, with the formation of secondary phases (ZrO2 and \n\nPb) and modification of the stoichiometry of PZT, which damages the dielectric properties. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 38: Permittivity versus PbO % of PZT films with 1 wt % of (xB2O3 + (100-x) PbO), \n\nbeing x = 90, 80 and 50) and sintered at different sintering temperatures, 800\u00baC, 850\u00baC and \n\n900\u00baC for 30 minutes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n\nP\ne\nrm\n\nit\nti\nv\nit\ny\n (\n?? ?? r\n)\n\nPbO (%)\n\n900\u00baC,30min\n850\u00baC,30min\n800\u00baC,30min\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 39: Permittivity versus % PbO of PZT films with 1 wt % of (xB2O3 + (100-x) PbO), \n\nbeing x= 90, 80 and 50) and sintered at different sintering temperatures, 800\u00baC, 850\u00baC and \n\n900\u00baC for 60 minutes.  \n\n \n\nIn the next graph of the permittivity versus frequency (Figure 40) for PZT films with 90% \n\nB2O3 and 10 % PbO one can observe that high permittivities are obtained for the films sintered \n\nat 850\u00baC for 30 minutes and the permittivity at 1 kHz was approximately 342.

These differences reflect \n\nthe different behaviour of the sintering aids, being the vanadium lead oxide mixture more \n\neffective in terms of dielectric response at lower temperatures than the boron lead oxide \n\nmixtures, although films with this last mixture presented the highest values of dielectric \n\npermittivity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 47: Permittivity versus frequency for PZT films with 1wt % of (V2O5 + PbO) and \n\nsintered at 800\u00baC, 850\u00baC and 900\u00baC and for 30 and 60 minutes. __800 \u00baC for 30 minutes, with \n\nfilm thickness of 0.007 mm; __850 \u00baC for 30 minutes, with film thickness of 0.010 mm; __900 \u00baC \n\nfor 30 minutes, with film thickness of 0.011mm; __900 \u00baC for 60 minutes, with film thickness of \n\n0.009 mm.  \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n1.E+02 1.E+03 1.E+04 1.E+05 1.E+06\n\nP\ne\nrm\n\nit\nti\nv\nit\ny\n (\n? r\n)\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n1.E+02 1.E+03 1.E+04 1.E+05 1.E+06\n\nta\nn\n?? ??\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n \n\nFigure 48: Dielectric losses (tan ?) versus frequency for PZT films with 1wt % of (V2O5 + \n\nPbO) and sintered at 800\u00baC, 850\u00baC and 900\u00baC and for 30 and 60 minutes. __800 \u00baC for 30 \n\nminutes, with film thickness of 0.007 mm; __850 \u00baC for 30 minutes, with film thickness of 0.010 \n\nmm; __900 \u00baC for 30 minutes, with film thickness of 0.011mm; __900 \u00baC for 60 minutes, with \n\nfilm thickness of 0.009 mm.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFor comparison the next graph depicts the variation of the dielectric permittivity and \n\nlosses as a function of frequency of PZT thick films on Cu foil sintered at 1000 \u00baC for 30 min at \n\npO2 ~5 x10\n-5 atm. The dielectric permittivity at a frequency of 10 kHz is 90 and the dielectric \n\nloss was 0.2. It\u00b4s obvious from these results that PZT thick films on Cu substrates sintered \n\nwithout sintering aids have not the required properties required to embed them into electronic \n\nsystems. On the other hand and based on the above results, PZT films on Cu sintered with a \n\nmixture of B2O3 + PbO posses enhanced properties making these films good candidates for \n\nembedding microelectronics applications.These observations are well visible in the next table. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 49: Dielectric Permittivity and Dielectric Loss of PZT thick films on Cu foil sintered \n\nat 1000 \u00baC for 30 min at pO2 ~5 x10\n-5 atm as a function of frequency.

Conclusions  \n\nIn order to decrease the sintering temperature of thick PZT films to make them \n\ncompatible with the use of Cu substrates and to improve the film quality and dielectric \n\nperformance for embedded circuit applications, using a low cost based process, the following \n\napproaches were tested in this work: fabrication of PZT films by EPD and utilization of two \n\ndifferent types of sintering aids: borate-based glass powders and a mixture of lead and boron \n\noxide. \n\nIt was verified that the addition of glass powders was not very effective as a sintering aid. \n\nThe main reason behind this observation is associated with the difficulties in depositing \n\nhomogenous thick films by EPD, what is related with problems in keeping stable the suspension \n\nof PZT and glass powder. The stability of the suspension depends on the interaction between \n\nelectrostatic and van der Waals forces acting on the individual particles. The coagulation of a \n\ndisperse system (suspension) is the result of the interaction of such forces. High electrostatic \n\nrepulsion forces occur for highly charged particles what was impossible to obtain in these PZT + \n\nborate glass suspensions. To improve the quality of the deposition, binders were added, but \n\nweren\u2019t effective and there was not any improvement in the quality of the deposition. As a \n\nconsequence these films presented a poor dielectric response. More research is necessary to \n\noptimise the stability of the suspension what implies the understanding of the mechanism of \n\ncharging glass particles. \n\nOn the other hand, it was verified that under controlled pO2 atmosphere dense thick PZT \n\nfilms on Cu were obtained in the presence of 1 and 3 wt % of a mixture of B2O3 and PbO. In this \n\ncase the stability of the suspension, related with the high zeta potential, was very good and \n\nhomogeneous and compact films were deposited on Cu foils. The addition of B2O3 + PbO was \n\nindeed effective in reducing the sintering temperature of PZT thick films and the best dielectric \n\nbehaviour was obtained for 3 wt % of (50% B2O3 + 50% PbO) and films sintered at 850\u00baC for 30 \n\nminutes. For sintering temperatures higher than 850\u00baC the dielectric properties deteriorate, what \n\nmay be related with the reaction of PZT with the Cu substrate.  \n\nIn conclusion, using EPD technology, crack-free PZT thick films with 3 wt % of addition of \n\n(50 % B2O3 + 50 % PbO) on Cu foils were obtained after sintering at temperatures lower than \n\n900\u00baC under controlled pO2 atmosphere and present dielectric permittivities ~1195 and \n\ndielectric losses ~0.02. The obtained dielectric performance is superior to the one of PZT films \n\npreviously prepared in which lead oxide and vanadium oxide were used as sintering aids. In this \n\ncase after sintering at 900\u00baC for 30 min a dielectric permittivity of ~450 and loss tangent of 1.39 \n\nwas reported.[45]  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n[1] R. P.
