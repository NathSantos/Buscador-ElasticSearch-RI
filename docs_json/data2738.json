Estes dois fatores em regra geram conflitos e atitudes negativas por parte das popula\u00e7\u00f5es humanas, face ao impacto negativo que as esp\u00e9cies silvestres t\u00eam nas atividades humanas, como a agricultura ou piscicultura. Em casos extremos, as esp\u00e9cies podem ser alvo de persegui\u00e7\u00e3o por parte do Homem, levando ao seu decl\u00ednio e por vezes extin\u00e7\u00e3o local em retalia\u00e7\u00e3o pelos danos causados. Estes problemas s\u00e3o particularmente relevantes em regi\u00f5es com elevada incid\u00eancia de esp\u00e9cies potencialmente problem\u00e1ticas (e.g. predadores), sendo os Tr\u00f3picos um exemplo adequado.\nO Sudeste brasileiro \u00e9 a regi\u00e3o mais povoada e desenvolvida do Brasil. Como consequ\u00eancia, apresenta graves problemas ambientais, incluindo desfloresta\u00e7\u00e3o em larga escala dos seus principais biomas (Mata Atl\u00e2ntica e Cerrado), considerados hotspots de biodiversidade. Esta desfloresta\u00e7\u00e3o atinge igualmente a vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o rip\u00e1ria associada aos ambientes aqu\u00e1ticos (e.g. ribeiras, rios ou estu\u00e1rios), considerada um dos habitats mais sens\u00edveis a altera\u00e7\u00f5es antr\u00f3picas, levando \u00e0 consequente perda de locais de ref\u00fagio, reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o e alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o para diversas esp\u00e9cies. Os mam\u00edferos semiaqu\u00e1ticos s\u00e3o um dos grupos animais mais sens\u00edveis a estas altera\u00e7\u00f5es, pois a sua persist\u00eancia depende significativamente da exist\u00eancia desta vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o durante o seu ciclo de vida. As lontras, pelas suas caracter\u00edsticas bio-ecol\u00f3gicas, s\u00e3o frequentemente utilizadas em estudos que visam a resposta de esp\u00e9cies semiaqu\u00e1ticas a press\u00f5es antr\u00f3picas.\nA lontra Neotropical, Lontra longicaudis (Olfers, 1818), uma das duas esp\u00e9cies de lontras existentes no Brasil, \u00e9 considerada uma das menos conhecidas a n\u00edvel mundial. A esp\u00e9cie est\u00e1 presente numa variedade de corpos de \u00e1gua, incluindo barragens e a\u00e7udes. O recente aumento de informa\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel sobre a esp\u00e9cie levou a uma mudan\u00e7a no seu estatuto de amea\u00e7a, de \u201cInforma\u00e7\u00e3o Insuficiente\u201d para \u201cQuase Amea\u00e7ada\" desde o final de 2015 devido, entre outros fatores, a incertezas sobre os efeitos das in\u00fameras amea\u00e7as antr\u00f3picas, mantendo-se, no entanto, um elevado desconhecimento sobre o efetivo populacional, \u00e1rea de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o, efeito cumulativo de amea\u00e7as ou intera\u00e7\u00e3o com as popula\u00e7\u00f5es humanas. Contudo existe a perce\u00e7\u00e3o de competi\u00e7\u00e3o por peixe, em rios e em tanques de pisciculturas, e relatos de persegui\u00e7\u00e3o a lontras por parte de piscicultores e pescadores em algumas \u00e1reas do Brasil.\nAssim, estudos sobre a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos conflitos entre a lontra e as popula\u00e7\u00f5es humanas e a sua distribui\u00e7\u00e3o regional, s\u00e3o considerados vitais para a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o efetiva da esp\u00e9cie.\nO presente estudo foi realizado na bacia do rio Guare\u00ed e na sua envolv\u00eancia, no estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil. Esta \u00e1rea est\u00e1 inserida nos munic\u00edpios de Guare\u00ed e Angatuba, originalmente correspondentes ao bioma Cerrado. \u00c9 uma \u00e1rea prop\u00edcia \u00e0 agricultura devido em grande parte, \u00e0 sua extensa rede hidrogr\u00e1fica. A popula\u00e7\u00e3o local \u00e9 composta principalmente por agricultores, gestores/encarregados de fazendas e pescadores de pequena escala, com uma elevada percentagem de pescadores desportivos e ocasionais.\nEste estudo teve por objetivos: 1 - Avaliar o conhecimento da popula\u00e7\u00e3o local sobre a ecologia da lontra Neotropical e sua perce\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie; 2 - Identificar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre o conhecimento e as atitudes da popula\u00e7\u00e3o local em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 lontra; 3 - Identificar fatores de amea\u00e7a para a esp\u00e9cie na \u00e1rea de estudo, incluindo potencial para o conflito com o Homem; e 4 - Obter informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie na \u00e1rea da bacia do rio Guare\u00ed e sua envolv\u00eancia.\nOs resultados esperados eram: (1) a exist\u00eancia de um potencial para conflito entre a comunidade local e a lontra, devido \u00e0 competi\u00e7\u00e3o pelos mesmos recursos, bem como com propriet\u00e1rios/utilizadores de pequenas lagoas/a\u00e7udes; (2) n\u00edveis de conhecimento vari\u00e1veis na comunidade local sobre a ecologia da lontra, com vantagem para os pescadores locais; e (3) uma correla\u00e7\u00e3o positiva entre o conhecimento e as atitudes em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 esp\u00e9cie. Adicionalmente, (4) era esperada uma identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos fatores sociais, como localiza\u00e7\u00e3o geogr\u00e1fica, idade ou escolaridade, que poder\u00e3o estar a influenciar as atitudes e conhecimento das pessoas face \u00e0 esp\u00e9cie.\nPara tal foram realizadas 44 entrevistas \u00e0 popula\u00e7\u00e3o, entre outubro de 2015 e mar\u00e7o de 2016, guiadas por um question\u00e1rio presencial semiestruturado. A maioria dos entrevistados pertencia ao setor prim\u00e1rio (agricultores, pescadores e gestores de fazendas) e secund\u00e1rio (trabalhadores da constru\u00e7\u00e3o civil). O question\u00e1rio incluiu perguntas sobre: i) o perfil do entrevistado, ii) a ecologia e contacto com a lontra; iii) atitudes para com a esp\u00e9cie, iv) e ainda perguntas sobre o habitat, qualidade da \u00e1gua e seu uso pela popula\u00e7\u00e3o local.\nPrimeiramente foram criadas diversas vari\u00e1veis com base na informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o perfil do entrevistado: Grupo (pescador/n\u00e3o pescador); Uso de a\u00e7udes (usa/n\u00e3o usa); Localiza\u00e7\u00e3o; Classe de idade e Escolaridade. Seguidamente foram criados dois \u00edndices: o \u00cdndice de Conhecimentos com base em perguntas sobre a ecologia da esp\u00e9cie e o \u00cdndice de Atitudes, com base numa escala de Likert constru\u00edda para avaliar as atitudes das pessoas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 lontra. A fim de avaliar se as perguntas de cada um dos \u00edndices eram ou n\u00e3o independentes\nentre si, recorreu-se a An\u00e1lises de Componentes Principais (PCA). Sempre que se verificou correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre perguntas, aplicou-se o coeficiente alfa de Chronbach para avaliar a consist\u00eancia interna das perguntas que compunham o \u00edndice. Foram tamb\u00e9m elaborados Escalonamentos Multidimensionais (NMDS) para perceber quais as potenciais rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre as vari\u00e1veis e os \u00edndices criados, antes da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o dos testes estat\u00edsticos. Finalmente, todas as perguntas do question\u00e1rio individualmente e os dois \u00edndices criados foram comparados com cada uma das cinco vari\u00e1veis atrav\u00e9s de testes de Mann-Whitney ou Kruskal-Wallis, dependendo da tipologia de vari\u00e1vel.\nComplementarmente, entre os meses de outubro de 2015 e junho de 2016, foram realizadas campanhas de campo para valida\u00e7\u00e3o dos locais de avistamento de lontras referidos nas entrevistas, permitindo construir um mapa de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie na \u00e1rea de estudo.\nCom esta abordagem, verificou-se que os entrevistados s\u00e3o capazes de identificar a esp\u00e9cie com base na sua morfologia, uma vez que a descreveram corretamente. No geral a popula\u00e7\u00e3o apresenta um elevado conhecimento sobre a ecologia da lontra, mas por outro lado mostrou desconhecer o estatuto de amea\u00e7a da esp\u00e9cie, tanto a n\u00edvel internacional como regional (estado de S\u00e3o Paulo). Quando analisado por localiza\u00e7\u00e3o, o conhecimento revelou-se significativamente menor na \u00e1rea da cidade de Guare\u00ed (uma das cinco localiza\u00e7\u00f5es amostradas), facto que pode ser justificado pela menor concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de pescadores na regi\u00e3o, pois esta encontra-se mais pr\u00f3xima da nascente do rio Guare\u00ed, que \u00e9 uma zona mais pedregosa e por isso menos adequada \u00e0 pr\u00e1tica de pesca.\nNo que respeita as atitudes, estas s\u00e3o no geral positivas, n\u00e3o tendo sido detetado nenhum conflito relevante com a esp\u00e9cie na regi\u00e3o, de acordo com a atual natureza da coexist\u00eancia dos habitantes com a lontra. No entanto, os utilizadores de a\u00e7udes apresentaram atitudes mais negativas quando comparados com n\u00e3o-utilizadores, o que pode ser justificado pelo facto de estes reservat\u00f3rios poderem ser usados como locais de explora\u00e7\u00e3o de peixe em pequena escala pelos seus propriet\u00e1rios, que muitas vezes aumentam os stocks de peixe nos a\u00e7udes com este objetivo.\nO mapa de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie obtido re\u00fane informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre 68 avistamentos ao longo dos \u00faltimos 20 anos, apesar da sua maioria estar concentrada nos \u00faltimos 2 anos. Este revelou que a lontra se encontra presente em toda a \u00e1rea de estudo e que apresenta uma presen\u00e7a regular ao longo do tempo, pois existem avistamentos temporalmente espa\u00e7ados nos mesmos locais. Os resultados do estudo indicam que o m\u00e9todo das entrevistas a popula\u00e7\u00f5es locais \u00e9\nmuito \u00fatil na obten\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00e3o acerca da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies com h\u00e1bitos solit\u00e1rios e de dif\u00edcil observa\u00e7\u00e3o como a lontra Neotropical.\nCom as entrevistas e as campanhas de campo realizadas, foi igualmente poss\u00edvel identificar potenciais amea\u00e7as ambientais para a lontra: (1) polui\u00e7\u00e3o dos rios por descarga de efluentes sem tratamento ou com tratamento deficiente, amea\u00e7a mais mencionada pelos entrevistados e mais observada durante as campanhas de campo; (2) desfloresta\u00e7\u00e3o, com especial destrui\u00e7\u00e3o da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o rip\u00edcola por convers\u00e3o dessas \u00e1reas em campos agr\u00edcolas; (3) redu\u00e7\u00e3o dos stocks de peixe, atualmente ainda sem grande express\u00e3o na regi\u00e3o mas situa\u00e7\u00e3o que no futuro pode vir a agravar-se se a qualidade da \u00e1gua continuar a declinar; e (4) perda de conetividade do habitat, consequente por exemplo do desaparecimento dos a\u00e7udes, o que pode levar a uma maior fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o do habitat para a lontra.\nUm maior investimento em a\u00e7\u00f5es de divulga\u00e7\u00e3o e de educa\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental, como aquelas j\u00e1 implementadas no decurso deste projeto contribuir\u00e1 para a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie na \u00e1rea de estudo. Mais a\u00e7\u00f5es de esclarecimento junto de pescadores para reduzir equ\u00edvocos como a quantidade e as esp\u00e9cies de peixe ingeridas pela esp\u00e9cie, ou junto de estudantes para despertar o seu interesse para quest\u00f5es ambientais e de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o, devem ser implementadas. Adicionalmente, a monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cie em \u00e1reas com: (1) maior potencial para conflito, (2) elevada interven\u00e7\u00e3o humana e (3) consideradas \u00f3timas para a ocorr\u00eancia da esp\u00e9cie, \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria a fim de antecipar a necessidade de promover medidas de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o.\nPalavras-chave: Lontra longicaudis, conhecimento local, distribui\u00e7\u00e3o, question\u00e1rios, conflito\nSummary\nThe Neotropical otter, Lontra longicaudis, is viewed as a potential competitor with humans in activities related to fisheries and aquaculture. Nevertheless, there are few studies concerning their possible interaction. With this study, we aimed at gathering information on the relation between local communities and the Neotropical otter as well as identifying environmental threats to the species and assessing the species distribution at Guare\u00ed river basin and its surroundings in Central-South S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil). We conducted forty-four semi-structured interviews, between November 2015 and March 2016, that included questions about the interviewees, otter ecology, attitude toward the species and on the habitat and water condition and its use by local people. Field surveys were also conducted to confirm information on otter occurrence in some of the areas with sighting records. Results showed that people using small ponds have a more negative attitude toward the otter, since they are used for fishing, with otters seen as competitors. Local population has a good knowledge of the species diet, habitat and activity period but most ignored its protection status; this indicates that knowledge is acquired through interactions with the species during labor or recreational activities with science-based knowledge not available or not transferred to public. Apparently, coexistence between local inhabitants and the otter is not problematic and no major conflict emerged. These are contrasting results with other areas of Brazil or Europe, where otter is a conflictual species and suffers persecution. This probably results from the fact that local fishing communities are not professional and fish stocks are still high. Otter is widespread in the study area, with information on sightings dating from 20 years ago up to the present, with most of the records in the last two years. Water pollution and destruction of the riparian vegetation for conversion to crop fields are major local anthropic pressures. More investment in education programs and species monitoring in risky areas for conflict might be decisive for local conservation efforts.\nKeywords: Lontra longicaudis, local knowledge, distribution, questionnaires, conflicts\nTable of Contents\nAgradecimentos..............................................................................iv\nResumo......................................................................................vi\nSummary......................................................................................x\n1.\tIntroduction............................................................................1\n1.1.\tTheoretical Framework..............................................................1\n1.2.\tStudy Aims.........................................................................5\n2.\tMethods.................................................................................6\n2.1.\tQuestionnaire survey...............................................................7\n2.1.1.\tQuestionnaire design..........................................................7\n2.1.2.\tSampling method and\tinterviews..............................................7\n2.1.3.\tStatistical analysis..........................................................9\n2.2.\tField surveys ....................................................................12\n3.\tResults ...............................................................................13\n3.1.\tInterviewees profile..............................................................13\n3.2.\tKnowledge and attitudes toward otters.............................................13\n3.3.\tOtter habitat and threat factors..................................................15\n3.4.\tOtter Distribution................................................................19\n4.\tDiscussion.............................................................................21\n5.\tFinal Remarks..........................................................................25\n6.\tReferences ............................................................................27\nAnnex.......................................................................................34\n1.\tIntroduction\n1.1.\tTheoretical Framework\nFor several thousands of years, man has induced major changes and pressures on natural habitats, either by converting them into anthropogenic landscapes (agricultural, urbanized) (Diamond, 2001, 2005) or by overexploiting resources provided by Nature (Micheli et al., 2001). In such context, conflicts between humans and predators arose, primarily because of competition for limited and shared resources (Akpona et al., 2015; Graham et al., 2005), and these are the product of socio-economic pressures and landscape management.\nAn example of a conflict-generator group of predators is the carnivore mammal community. These animals are globally characterized by having vast territories, low population densities and low intrinsic growth rate and for that are more susceptible to anthropic induced changes (Crooks, 2002). Carnivore mammals have also a great variety of feeding habits, that include all other animal groups, and this is the main reason why they are especially targeted as conflict species (Woodroffe, 2000). Episodes of competition between them and human populations have been reported around the world and are generally related to relevant economic activities, such as life-stocking (Berger, 2006) or fishing (Kranz and Toman, 2004). The coexistence between humans and predators has been reported for millennia, but the frequency of conflicts has grown in recent decades, mainly due to the exponential increase in human populations and the consequent expansion of human activities (Treves and Karanth, 2003; Woodroffe, 2000). These conflicts become more serious and intense in highly biodiverse regions, such as the Tropical region, that concentrates the largest proportion of global biodiversity, concerning both animal and plant taxa, encompassing several biodiversity hotspots (Brooks et al., 2006).\nBrazil is the second country in the world with the largest diversity of mammals (Vie et al., 2009), with about 650 native species (Cheida et al., 2006), of which the vast majority depends on forest native habitats that are currently being threatened. The Southeast is the most populated and developed region of Brazil. Consequently, it presents strong environmental problems, including a massive deforestation of its major original biomes, the Atlantic Forest and the \"Cerrado\" (Verdade et al., 2011), from core lands till the margins of aquatic environments. Thus, in this region, ecosystem modifications are intense and conservation concerns are high.\nAquatic environments (e.g. streams, rivers, estuaries) are among the most sensitive to anthropic induced changes and are currently under increasing pressure due to water pollution and loss of riparian vegetation. Riparian habitats are critical landscape elements for the conservation of several carnivore species, providing shelter and food (e.g. Matos et al., 2008). In spite of their recognized importance as ecosystem service providers (e.g., flood regulators), they are frequently considered to have small or no direct economic value, leading to substantial loss and degradation (Tockner and Stanford, 2002). Semi-aquatic mammal species, are constrained by the fact that in spite of spending most of their activity time in water, due to their terrestrial movements, they are also influenced by margin conditions and the surrounding landscape matrix (e.g. production forests, agricultural areas, livestock production) (Verdade et al., 2011). Habitat humanization near riparian areas is therefore a matter of concern since semi-aquatic mammals depend on these for terrestrial mobility and refuge.\nAmong semi-aquatic mammals, otters are used in ecological studies that aim the response of semi-aquatic species to human pressures (Alarcon and Simoes-Lopes, 2003; Pedroso et al.,\n2014)\t. Otters are also a group species that is on the spotlight of human related conflicts. Studies conducted, mainly in Europe, but also in other continents, like Africa (Akpona et al.,\n2015)\tshow that the relation between otters and people is often complicated, due to predation in fish farms, that can cause losses in commercial fish stocks (e.g., Vaclavikova et al., 2011). For example, Kranz (2000) reported that in areas where fish farming is an important industry, fish farmers perceive Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra, Linnaeus, 1758) as a threat, this being the case of central Europe, like in Czech Republic and Austria, but also southern countries such as Portugal (Freitas et al., 2007). For this reason, there are also some records of otter poisoning and illegal killing by fish farmers, mainly in eastern Europe (Kloskowski, 2005, 2011; Polednikova et al., 2010).\nHowever, negative public perceptions toward otters do not only apply to direct conflicting situations such as with fish farmers. For instance, Bath and Farmer (2000) found that more than one-quarter of teenagers questioned in Northern Ireland were afraid to swim in rivers where otters were present. Interestingly, in several studies concerning attitudes towards animals or their conservation, knowledge levels were correlated with attitudes, showing that the greater the knowledge, the more positive were attitudes toward otters (Bath and Farmer, 2000) or towards nature conservation in general (Rosalino and Rosalino, 2012).\nPublic perceptions and potential for conflict can also be influenced by aspects such as age, education and location. Pont et al. (2015), in a study on fishermen's perceptions on the South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens) in a marine protected area in southern Brazil, found that\nolder fishermen had a stronger sense of the damage caused by sea lions. Moreover, fishermen with a higher educational level had a less severe perception of damage caused by the species. In a review of published literature aimed at identifying the most investigated topics related to commercial fishers' attitudes towards Marine Protected Areas (Pita et al., 2011), divergent attitudes and perceptions were observed amongst fishers from different locations and cultural backgrounds and within different groups of fishers from the same location. However, common trends in fishers' attitudes were also observed irrespectively of geographical locations and cultural contexts (Pita et al., 2011).\nIn South America, some studies also report conflicts between fishermen and giant otters, Pteronura brasiliensis (Gmelin, 1788), because this species is more known due to their conspicuousness and highly territorial behavior (Lima et al., 2014; Michalski et al., 2012; Rosas-Ribeiro et al., 2012). But few publications address the interaction between men and the Neotropical otter, Lontra longicaudis (Olfers, 1818), namely in Brazil (Barbieri et al., 2012; De Castro et al., 2014) where the species co-exist with the giant otter. These are focused in fishery-based communities, where otters are seen as problematic, due to: 1) depredation in fishery and aquaculture stocks (Barbieri et al., 2012); and 2) gillnets damage, a common reported situation (Alarcon and Simoes-Lopes, 2004).\nBeing so, the Neotropical otter was chosen as model for this study. This species weights between 10 and 15 kg, with the males about 20% larger than the females. Being a semiaquatic animal, the otter is perfectly adapted to swimming, having a fusiform body and interdigital membranes, long and thick tail and short coat; this coat is greyish brown dorsally and slightly lighter ventrally (Lariviere, 1999).\nThe Neotropical otter has a wide distribution range (from Mexico to northern Argentina), occupying a variety of water bodies from sea level up to 4,000 m altitude: rivers, lakes, marshes, coastal areas and wetlands (Rheingantz and Trinca, 2015), including artificial reservoirs (Eisenberg and Redford, 1999). In Brazil, the species occurs almost everywhere, provided that water bodies show favorable conditions (rivers, streams, lakes and coastal areas with freshwater availability and with plenty of potential sites for burrows and resting sites), but is absent from a wide area in the semi-arid region in the north-eastern. Considered an opportunistic predator, the Neotropical otter prefers preys with low leakage capacity (Pardini, 1998; Quadros and Monteiro-Filho, 2001), feeding mostly on fish, but also consuming crustaceans, mollusks, amphibians and insects, depending on the time of year (Carvalho-Junior et al., 2010, 2013; Rheingantz et al., 2011).\nThe reproduction occurs mainly in the dry season, but in certain areas it can occur throughout the all year. Gestation lasts about 56 days and otters can have up to five pups, but the average is two or three (Lariviere, 1999). With solitary habits, except during the breeding season, it is mostly a diurnal species, being more active at the beginning and the end of the day, but becoming nocturnal in areas with high human presence (Rheingantz et al., 2016). The Neotropical otter is a territorial species, leaving scent marks (feces and mucus) to communicate their presence to conspecifics and to coordinate sexual activity. For refuge otters can use almost any cavity available on the riverbank, as well as digging shallow holes or open spaces in the underbrush (Pardini and Trajano, 1999).\nIn spite of its vast range the species is Considered to be \u201cNear Threatened\u201d, both by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and by the Brazilian government in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (Rodrigues et al., 2013). However, information is lacking about population size, area of occupancy, number of mature animals, the cumulative effect of threats (Rheingantz and Trinca, 2015), genetic diversity and levels of population connectivity, and even less is known about interactions with man (Barbieri et al., 2012). Threats include contamination and pollution of aquatic environments (Gallo-Reynoso, 1997), deforestation, agricultural activities, mining, construction of dams (Chehebar, 1990; Gallo, 1986; Gonz\u00e1lez and Utrera, 2004; Melendres, 1978), poaching (Chehebar, 1991; Gonz\u00e1lez and Utrera, 2004; IBAMA, 2001) and the increase of road kills due to habitat fragmentation (Duplaix, 2004). Studies concerning a more comprehensive understanding on distribution patterns and demographic parameters, such as population size and dispersal patterns (Rheingantz and Trinca, 2015), are therefore important for the conservation of the Neotropical otter.\nIn the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, small farmers combine fishing (both in rivers and in ponds) with agricultural activities. Many properties have natural or artificial small ponds usually used for water supply (for agriculture and cattle) but are also stocked with fish. Interactions between fishermen or people exerting other aquatic activities and the environment are important to the ecosystem management, due to the economic dependence of natural resources (Begossi et al., 2004). Being so, local communities that use aquatic resources can contribute with information about native species occurrence and status (Barbieri et al., 2012; De Castro et al., 2014). Local knowledge should be recognized as an important source of information for species management (Barbieri et al., 2012; Zappes et al., 2009). It becomes especially important when dealing with species with incomplete ecological information or facing drivers of conflict, that can be especially relevant when the resources involved have high economic\nvalue and the species under concern are legally protected (Thirgood et al., 2000), such as the case of the Neotropical otter.\nWith this study, we aimed to gather information on the relation between local communities, in a region of the S\u00e3o Paulo state in Brazil, and the Neotropical otter, and obtain additional ecological information on the species.\n1.2.\tStudy Aims\nSpecific objectives of this study were to:\n1\t- Evaluate the knowledge and perceptions of the local population about the Neotropical otter;\n2\t- Assess the relationship between knowledge and attitudes of the local population towards the species;\n3\t- Identify possible threat factors for the species in the study area, including potential for conflicts with humans; and\n4\t- Obtain information about the distribution of the species in the area of the Guare\u00ed river basin and its surroundings.\nWe expected: (1) an existing conflict between local fishermen and the otter that may lead to competition for the same resources (fish both in rivers and small ponds); (2) a greater knowledge on otter ecology by local fishermen compared to non-fishermen; and (3) a positive association between knowledge and attitudes (more knowledge leading to more positive attitudes towards the species). We further expect (4) that social factors such as geographic location, age or education of the interviewees are influencing the attitudes and level of knowledge about the species.\nWith this approach, we aimed to ascertain potential environmental threats to the local population of Neotropical otters and evaluate the need for conservation measures, as well as to provide a regional map of the species distribution.\n2.\tMethods\nThe study was conducted mostly in the \"Guare\u00ed\" and \"Angatuba\" municipalities, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil. The main river in these municipalities is Guare\u00ed river, inserted in the Alto Paranapanema river basin. It flows from 23\u00b020'54.1\"S / 48\u00b004'58.5\"W (river source) to 23\u00b028'38.3\"S / 48\u00b036'58.5\"W (river mouth). With an extension of approximately 78km has its source in the \"Guare\u00ed\" municipality (Secretaria do Meio Ambiente / Instituto Florestal, 2009), crosses through the \"Angatuba\" municipality and flows into the Paranapanema river (Henry, 2012) (Figure 1).\nBrazil\nAlto Paranapanema river basin\nGuare\u00ed river\n50 km\n' \u201cGuare\u00ed\u201d municipality\n\u201cAngatuba\u201d municipality\nS\u00e3o Pauio State\nFigure 1 - Study area in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, Alto Paranapanema river basin, Angatuba and Guare\u00ed municipalities and Guare\u00ed river.\nThe area is characterized by a sub-tropical climate (Cwa type according to Koppen climate classification; Peel et al., 2007), with average temperatures of 22\u00b0C in the warmest month (March) and 17\u00b0C in the coldest one (June). This region is highly suitable for agricultural production, due to its vast hydrographical network, represented by river courses with large (e.g., Paranapanema river), average (e.g., Itapetininga and Guare\u00ed rivers) and small (e.g., Santo In\u00e1cio and Jacu) water flows (Henry, 2012). Hundreds of farmsteads linked to the agricultural activity and recreation (\"ch\u00e1caras\") have emerged in riverine locations, including the Guare\u00ed river.\nThe study was based on: i) field interviews based on a questionnaire designed to assess local knowledge and attitudes towards the Neotropical otter, and ii) field surveys to confirm otter presence at locations given by interviewees.\n2.1.\tQuestionnaire survey\n2.1.1.\tQuestionnaire design\nThe questionnaire (Annex I), constructed as a guide for the interviews, was divided in four parts, each with a specific set of questions. Part I aimed the characterization of the interviewee (e.g. gender, age, education); Part II assessed knowledge about otters and its ecology, Part III assessed attitudes toward the species; and Part IV assessed the knowledge on otter habitat and water quality at the river and small ponds and its use by local people. Part IV was partly based on a previous questionnaire intended to report the history \"Angatuba\" municipality (Henry, 2012).\nThe questionnaire was semi-structured in design, being mostly composed by multiple choice questions (yes or no, or pre-established answers) and a few open questions, where interviewees were able to give details about their activities (Huntington, 2000). Peoples' attitudes toward the otter were measured by the Likert-type scale (Likert, 1932) and scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). A higher score indicates a more positive or negative attitude towards the otter. When statements represented a negative attitude, the scores were reversed for the analysis. To decrease the chance of having blank answers, the great majority of the questions included the option \"I do not know\".\nA pre-test was performed with experts and non-experts to confirm the relevance and comprehension of the questions, leading to small wording adjustments before field application.\n2.1.2.\tSampling method and interviews\nForty-four questionnaires were applied between October 2015 and March 2016. These were made through face-to-face interviews to a single individual and always by the same interviewer, in order to avoid sampling biases.\nTo ensure a higher likelihood that interviewees know about or had contact with otters they were selected on the basis of past or current activities connected to aquatic environments (e.g. fishing in rivers, river transportation, use of small ponds). Selection of interviewees was done with the help of local people (e.g. high school teacher, residents, representatives from state departments), in order to decrease chance of rejection and gain trust. These acted as guides and mediators. When necessary, a snow-ball method (Bailey, 1982) was used at the end\nof an interview, with the interviewee indicating others inhabitants suitable to respond the questionnaire.\nThe estimated time of the interview was around 15 to 20 minute but interviewees were allowed to make additional comments, complementing and contextualizing the answers to the questionnaire (Hill and Hill, 2000).\nA description of the animal was asked at the beginning of the interview. After that, a photograph of the otter was presented, to confirm whether the species indicated by the interviewee was indeed the Neotropical otter.\nIn order to maximize diversity of data collection, five areas were chosen for the interviews application: 1) \u201cBairro da Ponte\u201d, a small fishing village near the Guare\u00ed river mouth and its confluence with the Parapanema river; 2) \u201cSalto\u201d village, a small town bathed by the Paranapanema river, although located outside the main study area (in \u201cCampina do Monte Alegre\u201d municipality), was also considered since fishing is an important activity; 3) \u201cAngatuba\u201d city and its closest neighborhoods, located approximately in the middle of the Guare\u00ed river extension; 4) two contiguous farms (\u201cArca\u201d and \u201cTr\u00eas Lagoas\u201d) currently devoted to commercial Eucalyptus production although maintain areas devoted to conservation, according to the Brazilian law, and Angatuba's Ecological Station (henceforth EEcA, based on its Portuguese acronym \u201cEsta\u00e7\u00e3o Ecol\u00f3gica de Angatuba\u201d), characterized by a native vegetation of semideciduous seasonal forest and \u201cCerrado\u201d; all three properties are outside urban perimeter with an important number of small ponds; and 5) \u201cGuare\u00ed\u201d city and its surroundings, a larger urban area that corresponds to the beginning of the Guare\u00ed river (Figure 2).\nThese study areas have different characteristics (e.g. size, type of exploitation, number of small ponds, percentage of urban vs non-urban land-cover, percentage of native vs non-native vegetation, level of fishing activity) and a wide geographical distribution along the basin, ensuring high diversity of interviewees.\nFigure 2 - Location of areas where interviews (black circles; n= 44) were conducted (1 - Bairro da Ponte village, n=9; 2 - Salto village, n=9; 3 - Angatuba city, n=8; 4 - farms \"Arca\" and \u201cTr\u00eas Lagoas\u201d and Angatuba's Ecological Station (EEcA), n=10; 5 Guare\u00ed city and its surroundings, n=8). Main rivers and localities in the study area (Angatuba and Guare\u00ed cities and Bairro da Ponte, Salto and Guare\u00ed Velho villages).\n2.1.3.\tStatistical analysis\nUnivariate (Mann-Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis tests) and multivariate methods (Principal Component Analysis and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling) were used in order to better recognize potential relations between variables. The information gathered in Part I of the questionnaire (interviewee profile) was used to create variables categories (Table 1). Regarding age, the Sturges rule was applied. This is a widespread tool to simplify variables that have a wide variety of values (Scott, 2009). Its application resulted in the creation of six classes; but once the last class was under represented, classes 5 and 6 were merged. This categorization allowed the use of age as a factor in the statistical analysis, both as a continuous and ordinal variable.\nVariable\tCategory\nGroup\tFisherman Non-fisherman\nSmall Ponds\tUser Non-user\nEducation\tNo education Elementary school High school College degree\nAge class\tClass 1 (17 to 27 years) Class 2 (28 to 38 years) Class 3 (39 to 49 years) Class 4 (50 to 60 years) Class 5 (> 61 years)\nAge\tAbsolute value\nLocation\t\u201cBairro da Ponte\u201d village \u201cSalto\" village \u201cAngatuba's\u201d surroundings Farms/EEcA \u201cGuare\u00ed\u201d surroundings\nIn this study, we tried to balance the categories, mainly those we could control best like group, age and location.\nTwo indexes were created to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of interviewees about the otter. The first, the Knowledge index (KI) was based on the five questions about the ecology of the Neotropical otter. A right answer was coded with \"1\" and a wrong or \u201cI do not know\u201d answer was coded with \"0\u201d. This index varied between 0 and 5. The Attitude Index (AI) resulted from the interviewee opinions about given statements used in the Likert scale. These statements addressed a variety of actions people could take to conserve the otter and its habitat. Neutral opinions were coded with \"0\u201d, positive opinions with \"1\u201d or \"2\u201d depending on the degree of agreement, and negative opinions with \"-1\" or \"-2\u201d. Index value could vary between -14 and 14.\nA Pearson correlation was applied between age (absolute value) or age classes and the two indexes. The correlation was stronger with the age class, so was opted to use that variable in the analysis.\nData normality and homoscedasticity were tested with Shapiro-Wilk test and Levene's test respectively, but as assumptions failed non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis.\nA Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to explore the structure of the interview for each index and the relation between the questions and the interviewees' answers. It was also applied to see if the questions used in the KI and the statements used in the AI were correlated, contributing to the same result, or if they were independent with no relation between them. In the first case the Cronbach's alpha coefficient may be applied as a measure of internal consistency of the sets of questions/statements used in the indexes. Its value gives us a lower bound estimate of their reliability, indicating if they are positively related. Cronbach's alpha value varies between 0 and 1, but the reliability is considered satisfactory when alpha is at least 0.70 (Nunnally, 1978).\nA Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination was performed (Hyman and Sierra, 2010), using the scores of the KI and AI for each interviewee respondent. NMDS constructs a two-dimensional ordination with arbitrary axes in order to achieve the best representation of the relationships among interviewees based on a similarity matrix. The similarity matrix was designed using the Euclidean Distance for constructing the similarity matrix. A 2D bubble configuration plot was produced for both indexes. The robustness of the ordination is indicated by the stress value in the output diagram:&lt;0.2 gives a potentially useful twodimensional representation;&lt;0.1 corresponds to a good representation and&lt;0.05 reflects an excellent representation (Clarke and Warwick, 2001). Prior to NMDS application, data were transformed to improve normality, using a normalization by the standard deviation (Legendre and Legendre, 1998). Relationships between indexes and variables were explored by projecting the Pearson correlations between the NMDS axes and each variable on the ordination diagram.\nMann-Whitney U-tests - henceforth M-W - were applied, to test if there was a significant difference in the KI, AI and in frequencies of the answers given by fishermen and nonfishermen. The same applied to users and non-users of small ponds. Kruskall-Wallis H-tests -henceforth K-W - were used to test if there was a significant difference in the KI, and AI and in frequencies of the answers given per age classes, education levels and geographic locations. Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance was used to test if there was a correlation between the two indexes as these provide discrete data (Noether, 1981).\nThere was no effect of \"non-response\", because all people responded to all answers.\nMost of the statistical analyses were performed with the STATISTICA software, version 13 (Dell Inc, 2015) and IBM SPSS version 22 (IBM, 2013). Data analysis on NMDS was conducted using the software Primer 6.0 (Clarke and Gorley, 2006).\n2.2.\tField surveys\nField surveys in aquatic environments (streams, rivers, ponds) to search for otter signs of presence (dens, scats, footprints, claw markings) were conducted, by boat and foot transects, between October 2015 and June 2016 to validate the use of questionnaires as source of otter occurrence. A minimum of 30% of areas with reported sighting records was defined as appropriate. If after 1km of survey no sign was found the transect was considered negative for otter. In order to map Neotropical otter sightings in the study area, during questionnaires interviewees were asked to report whether, where and when they had seen an otter, for the last time and in the past. It was specifically asked to locate all sightings to get the maximum information regarding otter distribution. Data collated was as much precise as possible regarding location and date of sighting. This information was translated to a species occurrence map using QGIS version 2.10.1-Pisa (Quantum GIS Development Team, 2016).\n3.\tResults\n3.1.\tInterviewees profile\nOf the 44 interviewees, 90.9% (n=40) were men. The average age was 49 years (SD = \u00b1 14.9).\nMost of the interviewees (68.1%) attended elementary school meaning that the focus group had basic education; only 6.8% did not have any education. The distribution of interviewees per each category is given in Table 2.\nTable 2 - Number of interviewees per category\nVariable\tCategory\tNumber of interviewees\n\tFisherman\t26\nGroup\tNon-fisherman\t18\nSmall Ponds\tUsers\t23\n\tNon-users\t21\n\tNo education\t3\nEducation\tElementary school\t30\n\tHigh school\t7\n\tCollege degree\t4\n\tClass 1 (17 to 27 years)\t6\n\tClass 2 (28 to 38 years)\t5\nAge class\tClass 3 (39 to 49 years)\t10\n\tClass 4 (50 to 60 years)\t13\n\tClass 5 (> 61 years)\t10\n\t\u201cBairro da Ponte\u201d village\t9\n\t\u201cSalto\" village\t9\nLocation\t\u201cAngatuba's\u201d surroundings\t8\n\tFarms/EEcA\t10\n\t\u201cGuare\u00ed\u201d surroundings\t8\nInterviewees included people from the primary sector (farmers, fishermen, farm managers) (n= 18), civil construction, industry and small businesses workers (n= 8), teachers (n=2), students (n= 3), retired people (n=9), housewives (n=2), a biologist and a bus driver.\n3.2.\tKnowledge and attitudes toward otters\nRegarding the knowledge of the population about the Neotropical otter, all the interviewees knew the species, and all but one had already seen it. Otters had been seen in the surroundings of the place of the interview by 52.3% of interviewees and 59.1% have sighted the species elsewhere and were able to provide other locations for the species occurrence.\nRegarding the regularity of otter sightings, 56.8 % of interviewees stated they saw the animal at time lapses of more than one month, 6.8% said they saw the species monthly, 11.4% weekly and 22.7% more than once per week.\nWhen analyzing results by location and group, the inhabitants of the Farms/EEcA region saw otters less frequently than those in other regions (H=20.25, p<0.05), and fishermen more often than non-fishermen (U=20.3, p<0.05). The otter population trend was classified as \"increasing\" by 47.7% of interviewees, with fishermen being the group that reported that tendency more often (U=103, p<0.05), as opposed to those who think that the otter is decreasing (22.7%) or stable (15.9%).\nIn general, interviewees answered correctly to the questions about otter ecology, with an average knowledge score (KI) of 3.2. Almost all interviewees (97.7%) knew the main food resource in the otter's diet (fish), with 13.6% also referring birds as otters' prey. Concerning the habitat, 77.2% knew that the otter lives in riverbanks but when this question was analyzed by location, \"Guarei\" interviewees presented less knowledge of the species habitat, with 62.5% wrong and \"I do not know\" answers. On the other hand, \"Salto\" village inhabitants presented the most accurate knowledge about species habitat, with 100% correct answers (H=\n9.4,\tp<0.05). On species activity period, 84.0% reported the otter as more active during the day, mainly in the dawn and twilight.\nMost interviewees did not know that the Neotropical otter is currently protected by the Brazilian State government, mainly the inhabitants of \"Guarei\", where no one referred the otter as a protected species (H=10.5, p<0.05). Moreover, when asked if the drought affected the otter in some way, only 29.5% of the interviewees stated that it negatively affect otters, the other referring to it as beneficial, because it makes the prey (fish) easier to catch, or neutral. Fishermen think more often that drought is beneficial to otters than non-fishermen (U=153, p<0.05).\nRegarding the possible conflict between the human population and the otter, most interviewees stated that otters had never interfered with their activities (72.7%) nor their neighbors' activities (65.9%). But, when the answers are analyzed by location, \"Bairro da Ponte\" reported more incidents with otters when compared with the other four locations, both considering personal (H=15.8, p<0.05) and neighbors (H=12.3, p<0.05) damage. Fishermen also reported being more affected by the otters (U=170, p<0.05), as well as neighbors (U=143, p<0.05). Lastly, people with age varying between 39 and 49 years (class 3) reported more damage caused by otters (H=11.8, p<0.05).\nThe average attitude score (AI) towards otter was 9.6, in a maximum of \u00b114 points, indicating a positive attitude towards the otter.\n3.3.\tOtter habitat and threat factors\nRegarding otter habitat, prey and possible threat factors, 54.5% of the interviewees said that the water quality is decreasing (particularly those of age class 2 - H=7.8, p<0.05) and 65.9% stated that the amount of fish available in rivers or small ponds is declining. When asked if new species of fish are appearing in the river, 47.7% of interviewees answered yes, referring to Peacock bass (Cichla sp), Piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri - Kner, 1858) and Tilapia (Coptodon rendalli - Boulenger, 1897) as the main invasive species. \"Bairro da Ponte\" location (H=10.0, p<0.05) and fishermen group (U=308, p<0.05) were the ones thinking more often that the amount of fish species is increasing.\nUsers of small pounds more often consider that the amount of wild animals is increasing by those reservoirs (U=607.5, p<0.05).\nRegarding water availability, 84.1% of interviewees confirmed the region has been suffering from drought in the past years. Concerning the riparian vegetation, there was no concordance among interviewees, with 36.4% saying the vegetation is declining in area while 43.2% referred to it as increasing. But when analyzed per location, differences between locations emerged. Inhabitants of \"Salto\" village and \"Angatuba's\" surroundings state more often that the vegetation is decreasing, while those from \"Bairro da Ponte\", the Farms/EEcA and \"Guarei\" region, refer an increase in area. Lastly, when asked if the politicians were concerned about the river water quality, 63.6% of the interviewed people answered \"No\", with the older age class being the category that answered more often \"I do not know\" (H=10.9, p<0.05).\nThe PCA showed the KI questions are independent, being all distributed in different directions of the graph and representing different dimensions of the knowledge about the otter (Figure 3).\n1.0\n-1.5\t-1.0\t-0.5\t0\t0.5\nPC1\nFigure 3 - PCA applied to the Knowledge Index questions\nWhen applied to the AI statements, the PCA shows they are in some way correlated, contributing in general to the same result. Although, with the analysis of the Figure 4, the statements do not express all the same dimension.\nFigure 4 - PCA applied to the Attitude Index statements\nDue to the level of congruence among results Cronbach's alpha coefficient was only applied to the AI to validate the cohesion of its statements, showing a satisfactory reliability with a good cohesion between the statements that composed the index (a = 0.73). Although the elimination of some statements could increase the Cronbach's alpha value, it was very low and therefore all them were retained in the AI. Although the Cronbach's alpha, was not applied to the KI, this fact doesn't invalidate the application of the index, just shows the relation between the questions, that in this last case, could be all used independently.\nThe NMDS revealed trends in the relation between variables and the indexes. Concerning the KI output, the smaller values are mainly located in the \"Guarei\" surroundings axis, and larger values are located in the Farms/EEcA axis, revealing a possible correlation between KI and these locations (Figure 5). Regarding the AI output, the greater values of this index are located in the education axis while the smaller values are in the small ponds axis, indicating a positive and a negative relation with AI respectively (Figure 6).\nFigure 5 - NMDS between Knowledge Index values and chosen variables\nFigure 6 - NMDS between Attitude Index values and chosen variables\nThe stress value in both NMDS was zero, revealing that the representations with two axes are excellent, not being necessary the addiction of more axis, what could difficult the interpretation.\nSome of the NMDS trends reveled to be statistically true when M-W and K-W test were applied. Users of small ponds have more negative attitudes toward the otter (U= 148, p &lt;0.05) (Figure 7).\nFigure 7 - Box plot of the differences in the AI of users and non-users of small ponds.\nThe analysis of the otter knowledge in the different locations showed significant differences in the \"Guare\u00ed\" surroundings. In this town, the knowledge is lower when compared to the other four locations (H= 12.3, p &lt;0.05) (Figure 8).\nsurroundings\"\nI Mean\u00b11,96\u2018SD\nFigure 8 - Box plot of the differences in the KI between locations\nNo correlation was detected between the KI and the AI.\n3.4.\tOtter Distribution\nThe information obtained on otter sightings (n= 68) allowed to map otter distribution revealing a more or less generalized occurrence of the species in the study area (Figure 9).\nFigure 9 - Distribution of the Neotropical otter's sightings (black circles: &lt;2 years; grey circles: > 2 years) in the study area.\nThe 68 sightings corresponded to 57 different otter locations, since there are some sightings that occurred at the same location. The otter is widely distributed alongside the Guare\u00ed river basin, being also present in Paranapanema and Itapetininga rivers. Otter also occur in the \"Arca\" and \u201cTr\u00eas Lagoas\u201d farms, mainly in the main streams that cross those properties. In the EEcA, otter sightings were registered in places that have water permanently, namely the stretch of Guare\u00ed river and the larger pound inserted in the property. There were also reports of the species in seasonal streams.\nThese sightings date from 20 years ago up to the present, although the majority (53%) report to the last two years. In this study, field surveys allowed to confirm otter presence in 20% of the locations given by the interviewees, out of 35% surveyed sighting areas.\n4.\tDiscussion\nThe present study allowed the collection of relevant data about the Neotropical otter conflict assessment, the identification of other possible threat factors to the species and local otter distribution, contributing to an increased knowledge about the otter in the Guare\u00ed river basin and its surroundings. This is a relevant area for the species conservation in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, in Brazil.\nThe interviewees gave a correct description of the otter based on its morphological characteristics, confirming they are able to identify the species. This fact generates confidence in the data collected on otters during the interviews. Globally, the population has a good ecological knowledge of the species, especially of its diet, habitat and activity period. Two factors can contribute to the present widespread knowledge about the Neotropical otter. The first is the regularity of otter sightings in some areas, and the second the common and widespread practice of information transmission from the oldest to the younger generations that occurred in the region (Lisboa, 2008). However, this knowledge was unevenly distributed per locations with inhabitants of \"Guare\u00ed\" surroundings being less aware of the species. This can be justified with the fact that this region is located upstream the Guare\u00ed river, being less adequate to fishing activities (Henry, 2012). Additionally, the Guare\u00ed river is considered a medium flow river not easy to navigate and consequently less used for fishing activities when compared with the Paranapanema river. On the other hand, in \"Angatuba\" municipality, historical records prove that education was more widespread and complete when compared to neighboring municipalities, an aspect that can justify why the knowledge is locally greater (Lisboa, 2008). Notwithstanding, most interviewees did not know that the otter is a protected species (especially, again, in \"Guare\u00ed\" surroundings), indicating that knowledge is acquired through direct or indirect interactions with the species during labor or recreational activities and there is a deficiency of science-based information available to or assimilated by the public.\nNot well understood by the interviewees, especially fishermen, was the effect of drought to otters. They associate lower water levels to easiness in catching fish, not considering drought severity. In extreme situations, otters may be forced to move in search for other hunting grounds or face loss and fragmentation of habitat. This was observed during our field campaigns, when several ponds and small streams dried due to the extreme drought felted in 2014-2015. Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are becoming recurrent and unpredictable (e.g. there was a severe flood in the 2016 dry season) and will have impact on otter feeding and reproduction.\nThe inhabitants of the Farms/EEcA area reported less otter sightings when compared to other locations, that can be explained by distance to main river courses and lower water-related activities. When comparing fishermen with non-fishermen, the first see more often the species, an expected result since they have an higher likelihood to be in contact with otters, due to their fishing activity. Although a subjective assessment, since fishermen reported more often that the otter population is increasing, we could assume that this is probably a good indicator of a possible thrive of the otter population in the region for the last years.\nRegarding different perceptions on riparian vegetation cover among locations, these can be explained by the changes in land use along the Guare\u00ed river basin. In \"Angatuba's\" surroundings there is an increase of crop areas (Henry, 2012), causing more deforestation, namely along river sides, despite the conservative Brazilian environmental law (Metzger et al., 2010).\nRegarding the unbalanced sex-ratio of interviewees, this is common in communities with fishing habits (e.g. in a study that included two fishing communities in southern Brazil, of the 36 fishermen interviewed, only one was a woman - Barbieri et al., 2012). It was difficult to obtain a balanced age class distribution, because: on one hand some of the locations the representativeness of the younger age groups was very low, namely in Bairro da Ponte and Guare\u00ed surroundings; and furthermore the majority of the fishermen has around 40 to 60 years. Age class five (> 61 years) was the one that presented less knowledge about environmental measures promoted by politicians, a fact that can be related to less access of elderly people to information and also a higher discredit caused by a large number of unfulfilled promises by the local government. All age class two (28 to 38 years) interviewees think the water quality is decreasing with no clear reason.\nThe obtained results suggest that coexistence of inhabitants and the otter is not problematic, indicating that there is no major conflict. Only some interviewees, especially inhabitants from \"Bairro da Ponte\" and fishermen, reported few negative incidences involving the otter, like preying on gillnets and damaging fishing gear, a fact already mentioned in other regions of Brazil, like the states of Santa Catarina (Alarcon and Sim\u00f5es-Lopes, 2004) and Rio Grande do Sul (Barbieri et al., 2012). Regarding age class, 3 (39 to 49 years of age) was the one that reported more damage by otters, and this may be explained because these people are more active fishermen.\nThe perception of otters by interviewees was globally positive, because a large number of them did not explored fish and, when they did, their motivations were not economic but\nmainly for their own consumption. This was already reported in the Czech Republic with the Eurasian otter (V\u00e1clav\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 2011). In our study area, interviewees generally agreed that spotting otters in their natural environment is a highly attractive event, mentioning the species as an appealing animal that deserves protection. These are contrasting results with the state of Rio Grande do Sul, where two fishing communities see the otter as the major source of loss to their income (Barbieri et al., 2012). Our results are similar to those obtained in a fishing community in the south of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (Cai\u00e7ara) where, though the majority of the interviewees refer the otter as one of the major sources of fish loss, they understand that competition between humans and animals is inevitable and see the otter as a friendly companion (De Castro et al., 2014).\nOther studies also identified that the fishermen perception on the conflicts were directly related to otter depredation on fish in fishing gear and not to predation of fish species with no commercial interest (Alarcon and Sim\u00f5es-Lopes, 2004; Marques, 2001). In a previous study at the Paranapanema river (included in the study area), it was observed that the main species of fish preyed by the otter were those with low leaking capacity that live near the margins of the river and therefore are not the main catch by fishermen (Tavares et al., in press). However, they also reported fishing-net damage related to otters.\nThe average of both knowledge and attitude indexes reveals again that, in general, the population is knowledgeable about the species and do not perceive otters as a major problem to their activities. The significant differences in the KI between \"Guarei\" and the other locations are most probably related to the already referred environmental constrains, having less condition for the practice of fishing. Still regarding locations and although there was no significant relation, a positive trend was observed between KI and Farms/EEcA location, that can be related with the historical effort to provide valuable and efficient educations to rural areas (Lisboa, 2008).\nExpectation was that people with higher education would have more positive attitudes towards the otter and its conservation (Rosalino and Rosalino, 2012). For example, in a study about secondary-school students' knowledge of and attitudes toward the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and its conservation, results showed that students with greater knowledge had more positive attitudes (Torkar et al., 2010). Although there was no significant correlation between AI and KI values, nor between education and AI, a positive trend was observed. People that have progressed further in school, show attitudes with less variation, indicating a consistence in their opinions towards the otter.\nRegarding the attitudes of interviewees, small ponds users revealed to have a more negative attitude towards the otter, when compared to non-users. This can be justified because landowners frequently increase fish stocks at small ponds for their own consumption or for small scale sale. Moreover, these small ponds are usually located in more open areas, when compared to rivers, being easier to spot otters near the water. The simple spotting can be possibly seen as a competition event. That may explain also the pond users' perception of an increase in the number of wild animals using these reservoirs but also sustains the importance of these habitats for fauna especially during dry seasons and drought events.\nThe obtained distribution map shows an even distribution of the Neotropical otter in the study area, with a regular and continuous presence over the years. This result reveals that the interview method applied to local communities is a very useful tool to access distribution data of species with shy behavior like the Neotropical otter, being the inhabitants of the area more prone to see the species and give precise locations and habitat details.\nWith the interviews, it was also possible to identify potential environmental threats to otters at local scale. The first is water pollution, caused by agriculture and discharge of domestic effluents, namely that of the \"Guarei\" prison that is overcrowded and was a very poor water treatment; this was referred by several interviewees and observed during the field campaigns. Another threat is deforestation, with significant destruction of riparian vegetation, mainly for conversion into crop fields. In stretches of the rivers and streams it was possible to observe that it causes loss of refuge places, not only for otters but also for other species that depend from aquatic environments (Rheingantz and Trinca, 2015). Reduction in fish stocks was another mentioned threat, mainly due to the decrease of water quality. For now, this does not seem to be a problem for the otter, mainly because native fish species are being replaced by exotic ones (Tilapia); this however poses a problem for local biodiversity and should be a matter of concern for local conservation entities. Lastly small ponds revealed to be places where otters are seen in the area, a fact that support its role as connectivity elements, especially relevant in the dry season, when they represent water availability and act as important feeding areas mainly when close to watercourses with good refuge conditions (Basto et al., 2011). Although considered sub-optimal habitats, it is therefore important to preserve small ponds, not only for the otter, but also for other species, especially in view of ongoing habitat loss due to the conversion of farmland to eucalyptus plantations, with the consequent increase in evapotranspiration (Lima et al., 2012), drainage of water reservoirs, and severe drought events. For this reason, small ponds may be considered supplementary habitats.\n5.\tFinal Remarks\nThis study demonstrates how a social perspective provides insights about people's knowledge and attitudes towards a potential problematic species, as the Neotropical otter, and that traditional knowledge about animals can be an important asset for changing attitudes and protect conservation-interest species. From the data collected in the present study, we were able to conclude that presently there is a high frequency of interactions between the otter and fishermen, especially in Guarei and Paranapanema rivers. The reported shy behavior of Neotropical otters is not highlighted during some reported interactions, namely when removing the nets after a fishing period. This could be a potential threat to the species, if in the future a shift occurs in the current situation, namely a more professional fishing activity or a drastic reduction in the fish stocks, increasing conflict levels. Coexistence between the otter and locals seems peaceful at the moment, but if the present conditions change, especially the amount of fish in the rivers and the availability of small ponds, some management measures may need to be implemented (e.g., installation of fences around small ponds or landowners' compensation). In the Paranapanema river, some fishermen already freely adopted some proactive actions to minimize encounters, such as avoiding setting their nets near otter dens (Tavares et al., in press).\nThe objectives of the study were accomplished, however some difficulties were felt in the course of the field work, especially during the interviews. Sometimes the communication was difficult, mainly due to language constrains between Brazilian-Portuguese and Original-Portuguese. To overcome this problem and avoid misunderstandings, the questions and answers were repeated whenever necessary. Other limitation was the geographic imprecision of otter sighting locations given by some interviewees. To reduce uncertainty, an approximate distance was asked from the local where the interview was being conducted, and a map was also provided for pinpointing the sighting location so the information could be correctly incorporated in the distribution map.\nIn the future, some actions should be implemented in order to promote otter conservation both in the region and in other similar areas of Brazil. Monitoring species presence in: 1) potential areas for conflict, 2) human disturbance areas; and 3) optimal areas for otter occurrence such as protected areas, like Angatuba's Ecological Station, is needed in order to compare otter distribution and threat factors evolution and anticipate the need for conservation measures. The Neotropical otter is a \"Near Threatened\" species with still lacking scientifically sound information. For this reason, it is important to perform educational actions\nto widespread the existing information about the species, especially to people that coexist with it. Neotropical otter can also be used like a flagship species, once it is regularly seen by the inhabitants in the study area and is also referred as an attractive and friendly species.\nWith this in mind, several education actions were already implemented during the project, such as school presentations and participation on local environmental meetings and the production of supplementary material, like a short documentary about the Neotropical otter in the region and an informative record of the species for the students of the \"Angatuba\" and \"Guare\u00ed\" municipalities. Additionally, the information collected on ongoing otter threats is being conveyed to local public administration (e.g. municipalities, water management entities).\n6.\tReferences 1\nAkpona, A.H., Djagoun, C.A.M.S., Harrington, L.A., Kabre, A.T., Mensah, G.A., Sinsin, B., 2015.
