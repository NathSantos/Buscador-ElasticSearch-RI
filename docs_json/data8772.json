Drs. Pedro Terrinha e Filipe Rosas  \n\n \n\n2011 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nI \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nThe process of spontaneous subduction initiation at passive margins plays a \n\ncentral role in the plate tectonics theory, in particular in the Wilson Cycle paradigmatic \n\nconcept, which states that oceans form, evolve and finally close. The Wilson Cycle \n\nrequires that after a certain time of oceanic drifting passive margins are reactivated and \n\nsubduction initiates. However, the process of transformation of passive continental \n\nmargins into active continental margins with subduction zones is still far from \n\nunderstood, and spontaneous transition examples between these two types of margins \n\nare not known. In addition, recent works based on theoretical calculations and physical \n\nmodeling showed that it is mechanically unfeasible to form a new subduction system in \n\nisolation from an already existing one, i.e. spontaneous subduction initiation. One way \n\nto solve this problem is to consider that subduction initiation may generally be induced \n\nby the proximity of another subduction zone or by stress transference from a nearby \n\ncollision belt, i.e. induced subduction initiation. Therefore, passive margins in the \n\nproximity of pre-existing subduction zones would represent preferential sites for the \n\nformation of new subduction zones. In this work, the Gibraltar Arc and the Southwest \n\nIberia Margin are used as case studies to investigate the role that the orogenic arcs may \n\nhave in the formation of new subduction systems at passive margins. \n\nThe Atlantic margins are generally described as the typical case of passive \n\nmargins, often termed Atlantic type margins. However, there are at least two regions \n\nwhere the Atlantic oceanic lithosphere is being consumed in subduction zones: in the \n\nScotia and in the Lesser Antilles arcs (in the Southwestern and central West Atlantic, \n\nrespectively). These subduction zones seem to have been transferred from the Eastern \n\nPacific ocean to the Atlantic domain and potentially represent precursors to a system of \n\nconvergent zones that might ultimately result in the closure of the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nHowever, in these two systems the oceanic lithosphere has been subducted since at least \n\nthe Early Cenozoic, without lateral propagation of the subduction zones along the \n\nadjacent Atlantic passive margins. The Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. the foreland of the Gibraltar \n\norogenic arc, has been proposed as a potential locus for a subduction zone to propagate \n\ninto the open Atlantic. On the other hand, the proximity of the Gibraltar collision belt to \n\nthe Southwest Iberia Margin, together with the existing overall convergence between \n\n\n\nII \n\n \n\nAfrica and Iberia, induces compressive stresses that, in association with the existence of \n\nmore than 100 km long active thrusts (e.g. Horseshoe Fault and Gorringe Bank), make \n\nthis margin a strong candidate for the nucleation of a new subduction zone.  \n\nIn order to better evaluate the post-Miocene tectonics and the main tectonic \n\ndriving mechanism operating in the Gulf of Cadiz an up-to-date tectonic map of this \n\narea was produced. This map was based on the coupled analysis of a multi-survey MCS \n\ndataset and the recently compiled high resolution bathymetry dataset (the SWIM \n\nbathymetry). The mapping revealed the existence of three main systems of tectonic \n\nstructures: i) the subduction-related Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (CGAW); ii) a \n\nset of WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-slip faults (the SWIM fault system); and iii) a \n\ngroup of NE-SW striking northwest-directed thrusts located in the Southwest Iberia \n\nMargin (the NE-SW thrust system).  \n\nThe subduction-related accretionary wedge (GCAW) is materialized on the \n\nseafloor by a west dipping U-shaped surface and consists in an eastward thickening pile \n\nof westwards thrusted sediments. There are evidences that this thrust wedge is active \n\nand propagating westward.  \n\nThe SWIM fault system is a group of WNW-ESE striking subvertical strike-slip \n\nfaults extending from the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. the northwest Moroccan \n\nshelf, to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. These faults were interpreted in this work as the \n\nPresent day dextral reactivation of the old Mesozoic Tethyan plate boundary.  \n\nThe NE-SW striking thrust system is a group northwest directed thrusts located \n\nalong the Southwest Iberia Margin, comprising the Horseshoe fault, the Marqu\u00eas de \n\nPombal fault, the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault and the Gorringe northern thrust. This NE-\n\nSW thrust system seems to be the result of the migration of the deformation, in the \n\nPliocene-Quaternary, from the realm of the Gibraltar wedge to the west (onto the \n\nHorseshoe fault region) and to the north along the West Portuguese Margin. These \n\nstructures may be the expression of a new compressive deformation front.  \n\nBesides these three tectonic systems, other important structures were also \n\npromptly recognized such as the ENE-WSW to E-W striking system of thrusts (e.g. the \n\nPortim\u00e3o pop-up and the Coral Patch Ridge), related with the overall Cenozoic Nubia-\n\n\n\nIII \n\n \n\nIberia N-S convergence, and NE-SW striking Cadiz fault, a dextral strike-slip fault that \n\nprobably accommodates part the westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc. \n\nThe analysis of the multibeam bathymetry data from the northwestern part of the \n\nGulf of Cadiz also revealed the existence of several intriguing kilometric crescentic \n\ndepressions lying at depths between -4300 m and -4700 m, never before reported to \n\noccur at such great depths in the scientific literature. These features are located in the \n\nHorseshoe Valley between two major tectonic structures: the GCAW and the Horseshoe \n\nfault. Morphological parameterization of these features, coupled with detailed analysis \n\nof multi-channel and middle resolution seismic profiles, showed that these crescent-\n\nshaped features were formed due to the existence of specific interaction between: a) \n\nregional active thrusts on top of which most crescentic depressions are carved; and b) \n\ntectonically induced scouring comprising localized erosion and simultaneous \n\nprogradational sedimentation, produced by downslope turbiditic currents. The obtained \n\nresults also suggest a possible contribution of fluid migration and extrusion processes, \n\nsuch as mud volcanism and associated pockmark formation, besides gravity driven \n\nlandslides and slumping, in the development of the studied crescentic depressions. The \n\nactive (mainly blind) thrusts in which the crescentic depressions are carved root in the \n\nGCAW d\u00e9collement layer, to the west of the GCAW deformation front. Therefore, the \n\ncrescentic depressions are interpreted as the morphological expression of the westward \n\npropagation of the deformation related with the GCAW, into the Horseshoe Valley \n\ndomain. \n\nBesides the new produced cartography of the Gulf of Cadiz, the present work \n\nalso benefited from the instrumental use of analog modeling experiments. Three main \n\ndifferent modes of tectonic interference between the SWIM strike-slip fault system \n\n(related with the overall Nubia-Iberia convergence) and the GCAW (related with the \n\nGibraltar subduction) were tested through analog sand-box modeling, namely: a) An \n\nactive accretionary wedge on top of a pre-existent inactive basement fault; b) An active \n\nstrike-slip fault cutting a previously formed, inactive, accretionary wedge; and c) \n\nSimultaneous activity of both the accretionary wedge and the strike-slip fault. The \n\nresults obtained and the comparison with the natural deformation pattern favor a \n\ntectonic evolution comprising two main steps: i) the development of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nAccretionary Wedge on top of inactive, Tethyan-related, basement faults (Middle \n\nMiocene to ~1.8 Ma); ii) subsequent reactivation of these basement faults with dextral \n\n\n\nIV \n\n \n\nstrike-slip motion (~1.8 Ma to Present) simultaneously with continued tectonic \n\naccretion in the GCAW. These results exclude the possibility of ongoing active SWIM \n\nwrench system cross-cutting an inactive GCAW structure. The results also support a \n\nnew interpretation of the SWIM wrench system as fundamentally resulting from strike-\n\nslip reactivation of an old (Tethyan-related) plate boundary.  \n\nDetail mapping in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain also revealed the existence of a \n\nnew morphotectonic pattern near the intersection (corner zone) of the SWIM 1 fault and \n\nthe Horseshoe fault. Based on combined analog and numerical experiments this pattern \n\nwas interpreted as resulting from the (wrench-thrust) tectonic interference between two \n\nof the main tectonic systems recognized in the Gulf of Cadiz area: the SWIM faults and \n\nthe NE-SW thrusts.  \n\nFinally, the results presented in this work favor a hypothetic scenario in which \n\nthe Gibraltar subduction is active, but decreasing in activity since the Miocene, at the \n\nsame time that an incipient subduction zone may be nucleating in the Southwest Iberia \n\nMargin. The Gulf of Cadiz may be thus seen as a place where the proximity of a pre-\n\nexistent subduction system could be inducing the formation of a new subduction zone in \n\nthe Atlantic.  \n\n \n\nKeywords: Subduction initiation; Gulf of Cadiz; Tectonic Map; Crescent-shaped \n\nDepressions; Thrust-Wrench Interference. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nV \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\n O processo de inicia\u00e7\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea de novas zonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo de \n\nmargens passivas tem um papel central na teoria da tect\u00f3nica de placas, em particular no \n\nconceito paradigm\u00e1tico de Ciclo de Wilson, que afirma que os oceanos formam-se, \n\nevoluem e finalmente acabam por fechar. O Ciclo de Wilson requer que ap\u00f3s um \n\ndeterminado tempo de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de um oceano as suas margens passivas sejam \n\nreactivadas e que uma nova zona de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o se inicie. No entanto, o processo de \n\ntransforma\u00e7\u00e3o de margens continentais passivas em margens continentais activas com \n\nzonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 praticamente desconhecido, sendo que n\u00e3o se encontra \n\ndocumentado nenhum caso de transi\u00e7\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea entre estes dois tipos de margens. \n\nAcresce ainda que, trabalhos recentes de modela\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica e c\u00e1lculos te\u00f3ricos \n\nmostraram que \u00e9 fisicamente implaus\u00edvel a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de novos sistemas de zonas de \n\nsubduc\u00e7\u00e3o isolados de zonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9-existentes, isto \u00e9 subduc\u00e7\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea. \n\nUma forma de ultrapassar esta inconsist\u00eancia \u00e9 considerar que a inicia\u00e7\u00e3o de novas \n\nzonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 em geral induzida pela proximidade de outras zonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nou por compress\u00e3o induzida a partir de um or\u00f3geno pr\u00f3ximo, isto \u00e9, subduc\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ninduzida. Deste modo, as margens passivas pr\u00f3ximas de zonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9-\n\nexistentes podem ser vistas como os locais preferenciais para a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de novas \n\nzonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o. No presente trabalho, usa-se o Arco de Gibraltar e a Margem \n\nSudoeste Ib\u00e9rica como casos de estudo na tentativa de abordar a tem\u00e1tica do papel que \n\nos arcos orog\u00e9nicos podem ter na forma\u00e7\u00e3o de novas zonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo de \n\nmargens passivas. \n\nAs margens Atl\u00e2nticas s\u00e3o geralmente descritas como o caso t\u00edpico de margens \n\npassivas, pelo que estas s\u00e3o comummente denominadas de margens do tipo Atl\u00e2ntico. \n\nNo entanto, h\u00e1 pelo menos dois locais na Terra onde litosfera oce\u00e2nica Atl\u00e2ntica \u00e9 \n\nconsumida em zonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o: no arco Scotia e no arco das Pequenas Antilhas (no \n\nSudoeste Atl\u00e2ntico e no Atl\u00e2ntico Oeste central, respectivamente). Estes dois casos de \n\nzonas de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o parecem ter sido transferidas do Oceano Pac\u00edfico oriental para o \n\ndom\u00ednio Atl\u00e2ntico e podem ser vistos como os precursores do desenvolvimento de um \n\nnovo limite de placas convergente que poder\u00e1 em \u00faltima instancia levar ao fecho do \n\nOceano Atl\u00e2ntico. Por\u00e9m, a litosfera oce\u00e2nica tem vindo a ser subductada nestes dois \n\n\n\nVI \n\n \n\nsistemas desde pelo menos o Cenoz\u00f3ico inferior, sem ter ocorrido a propaga\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nsubduc\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo das margens passivas atl\u00e2nticas adjacentes. O Golfo de C\u00e1dis, isto \n\n\u00e9, a bacia de ante-pa\u00eds do arco orog\u00e9nico de Gibraltar, tem sido descrito como o terceiro \n\nlocal na Terra onde existe o potencial para uma zona de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9-existente \n\npropagar-se para dom\u00ednio Atl\u00e2ntico. Por outro lado, a proximidade do Arco de Gibraltar \n\nem rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Margem Sudoeste Ib\u00e9rica, em conjunto com a exist\u00eancia de converg\u00eancia \n\ngeneralizada entre as placas tect\u00f3nicas \u00c1frica e Ib\u00e9ria, induz tens\u00f5es compressivas nesta \n\nmargem o que, em associa\u00e7\u00e3o com a exist\u00eancia de cavalgamentos activos de largura \n\nsuperior a 100 km (por exemplo a Falha da Ferradura e o Banco Gorringe), a tornam \n\nnuma forte candidata ao processo de nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o de uma nova zona de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nCom o objectivo de melhorar a compreens\u00e3o da tect\u00f3nica p\u00f3s-mioc\u00e9nica e dos \n\nprincipais mecanismos tect\u00f3nicos for\u00e7adores a actuar no Golfo de C\u00e1dis foi elaborado \n\num mapa tect\u00f3nico actualizado \u00e0 escala do golfo. Este mapa foi preparado com base na \n\nan\u00e1lise conjunta de dados de diversas campanhas de s\u00edsmica de reflex\u00e3o multi-canal e \n\nde dados de batimetria multi-feixe de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o recentemente compilados \n\n(batimetria SWIM). A cartografia mostrou a exist\u00eancia de tr\u00eas sistemas de estruturas \n\ntect\u00f3nicas principais: i) o Prisma Acrecion\u00e1rio do Golfo de C\u00e1dis (PAGC); ii) um grupo \n\nde falhas de desligamento direito com a direc\u00e7\u00e3o WNW-ESE (sistema de falhas SWIM) \n\ne; iii) um grupo de cavalgamentos com a direc\u00e7\u00e3o NE-SW, vergentes para noroeste, \n\nlocalizados ao longo da Margem Sudoeste Ib\u00e9rica (sistema de cavalgamentos NE-SW).  \n\nO prisma acrecion\u00e1rio (PAGC) destaca-se no fundo do mar pela presen\u00e7a de um \n\nrelevo morfol\u00f3gico positivo em forma de U que consiste na express\u00e3o superficial do \n\nempilhamento de sedimentos cavalgados para oeste. Este prisma gerou-se como \n\nresultado da exist\u00eancia da referida zona de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o mergulhante para Este sob o Arco \n\nde Gibraltar. Existem evid\u00eancias de que este prisma acrecion\u00e1rio ainda est\u00e1 activo e a \n\npropagar-se para oeste. \n\nO sistema de falhas SWIM constitui um grupo de falhas de desligamento direito, \n\nsub-verticais, que se estendem desde a \u00e1rea mais oriental do Golfo de C\u00e1dis, na \n\nplataforma continental do noroeste de Marrocos, at\u00e9 \u00e0 Plan\u00edcie Abissal da Ferradura. \n\nEstas falhas foram interpretadas neste trabalho como tendo resultado da reactiva\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndireita da fronteira de placas Mesoz\u00f3ica do T\u00e9tis. \n\n\n\nVII \n\n \n\nO sistema de cavalgamentos NE-SW \u00e9 constitu\u00eddo por um grupo de \n\ncavalgamentos com direc\u00e7\u00e3o NE-SW, vergentes para noroeste localizados ao longo da \n\nMargem Sudoeste Ib\u00e9rica que compreende a falha da Ferradura, a falha do Marqu\u00eas de \n\nPombal, a falha da Plan\u00edcie Abissal do Tejo e o cavalgamento norte do Gorringe. A \n\ndeforma\u00e7\u00e3o plioc\u00e9nica-quatern\u00e1ria deste sistema \u00e9 interpretada como a express\u00e3o da \n\nmigra\u00e7\u00e3o da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o da frente de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o do PAGC para oeste (at\u00e9 \u00e0 zona da \n\nfalha da Ferradura) e para norte ao longo da Margem Oeste Portuguesa. Estas estruturas \n\nparecem corresponder a uma nova frente de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o compressiva, afastada do Arco \n\nde Gibraltar, que eventualmente poder\u00e1 resultar na nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o de uma nova zona de \n\nsubduc\u00e7\u00e3o na margem Sudoeste da Ib\u00e9ria.  \n\nPara al\u00e9m destes tr\u00eas sistemas tect\u00f3nicos, foram reconhecidas outras estruturas \n\nimportantes como \u00e9 o caso dos cavalgamentos com direc\u00e7\u00e3o ENE-WSW a E-W (e.g. \n\nBanco de Portim\u00e3o e Crista Coral Patch), relacionados com a converg\u00eancia N-S \n\ngeneralizada entre as placas N\u00fabia e Ib\u00e9ria no Cenoz\u00f3ico, e a falha de C\u00e1dis que \n\ncorresponde a um desligamento direito de direc\u00e7\u00e3o NE-SW e que acomoda parte do \n\nmovimento para oeste do Arco de Gibraltar e da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o lim\u00edtrofe da margem sul \n\nportuguesa. \n\n Os dados de batimetria multi-feixe da \u00e1rea noroeste do Golfo de C\u00e1dis revelaram \n\nainda a exist\u00eancia de um conjunto de intrigantes depress\u00f5es em forma de crescente com \n\ndimens\u00f5es quilom\u00e9tricas, localizadas entre os -4300 m e os -4700 m de profundidade. \n\nObjectos morfol\u00f3gicos com estas caracter\u00edsticas nunca haviam sido identificados a t\u00e3o \n\ngrandes profundidades. Estas depress\u00f5es est\u00e3o localizadas no Vale da Ferradura entre \n\nduas estruturas tect\u00f3nicas importantes: o PAGC e a falha da Ferradura. A an\u00e1lise \n\nmorfol\u00f3gica destas formas, em conjunto com a an\u00e1lise detalhada de perfis de reflex\u00e3o \n\ns\u00edsmica multi-canal e de m\u00e9dia resolu\u00e7\u00e3o, revelou que estas estruturas em crescente se \n\nformaram como resultado da interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre: a) actividade de falhas de cavalgamento \n\nque geram degraus tect\u00f3nicos no topo dos quais os crescentes est\u00e3o encaixados e b) \n\neros\u00e3o e re-deposi\u00e7\u00e3o simult\u00e2nea de sedimentos produzidos pela ac\u00e7\u00e3o de correntes de \n\nfundo, provavelmente de origem turbid\u00edtica, que interagem com estes degraus \n\ntect\u00f3nicos. Os resultados obtidos sugerem tamb\u00e9m uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de processos de \n\nmigra\u00e7\u00e3o e extrus\u00e3o de fluidos, como vulcanismo de lama e forma\u00e7\u00e3o de pockmarks, \n\npara al\u00e9m de movimentos de massa, no desenvolvimento das depress\u00f5es em forma de \n\ncrescente estudadas. Os cavalgamentos (essencialmente cegos) no topo dos quais os \n\n\n\nVIII \n\n \n\ncrescentes est\u00e3o encaixados enra\u00edzam ao n\u00edvel do descolamento basal do PAGC, a oeste \n\nda sua frente de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o morfol\u00f3gica. Deste modo, estas depress\u00f5es em forma de \n\ncrescente s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m interpretadas como a express\u00e3o da migra\u00e7\u00e3o da deforma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nrelacionada com o PAGC para oeste, em direc\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 \u00e1rea do Vale da Ferradura. \n\n Para al\u00e9m da nova cartografia tect\u00f3nica do Golfo de C\u00e1dis, sustentada na \n\ninterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de dados de s\u00edsmica multi-canal e batimetria multifeixe, este trabalho \n\nbeneficiou ainda do uso instrumental de modela\u00e7\u00e3o an\u00e1loga. Tr\u00eas modos de \n\ninterfer\u00eancia tect\u00f3nica entre o sistema de desligamentos SWIM (relacionado com a \n\nconverg\u00eancia generalizada entre a N\u00fabia e a Ib\u00e9ria) e o PAGC (relacionado com a zona \n\nde subduc\u00e7\u00e3o do Arco de Gibraltar) foram testados atrav\u00e9s de modela\u00e7\u00e3o an\u00e1loga, \n\nusando \u201dcaixas de areia\u201d, compreendendo: a) a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de um prisma acrecion\u00e1rio \n\nsobre uma falha basal inactiva pr\u00e9-existente; b) a actividade de uma falha de \n\ndesligamento afectando um prisma acrecion\u00e1rio inactivo previamente formado; e c) a \n\nactividade simult\u00e2nea de um prisma acrecion\u00e1rio e de uma falha de desligamento. Os \n\nresultados obtidos e a compara\u00e7\u00e3o com o padr\u00e3o de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o natural observado \n\nfavorecem um cen\u00e1rio de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o tect\u00f3nica que compreende duas etapas principais: i) \n\no desenvolvimento do PAGC sobre falhas basais inactivas, relacionadas com a abertura \n\ndo T\u00e9tis (entre o Mioc\u00e9nico M\u00e9dio e os 1,8 Ma); ii) subsequente reactiva\u00e7\u00e3o destas \n\nfalhas com movimento de desligamento direito (~1,8 Ma at\u00e9 ao presente) ao mesmo \n\ntempo que o PAGC se continuava a desenvolver. Os resultados excluem a possibilidade \n\nde exist\u00eancia de um sistema de desligamentos (SWIM) a cortar um prisma acrecion\u00e1rio \n\ninactivo (PAGC). Estes resultados suportam ainda uma nova interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema \n\nSWIM, na qual estes desligamentos resultam fundamentalmente da reactiva\u00e7\u00e3o direita \n\nda antiga fronteira de placas do extremo ocidental do oceano T\u00e9tis Alpino.  \n\n A cartografia detalhada realizada na regi\u00e3o da Plan\u00edcie Abissal da Ferradura \n\npermitiu tamb\u00e9m reconhecer um novo padr\u00e3o morfo-tect\u00f3nico existente na zona de \n\nintersec\u00e7\u00e3o (zona de canto) da falha SWIM 1 com a falha da Ferradura. Com base no \n\nuso conjunto de modela\u00e7\u00e3o an\u00e1loga e num\u00e9rica este padr\u00e3o foi interpretado como tendo \n\nresultado da interfer\u00eancia tect\u00f3nica (desligamento-cavalgamento) entre dois dos \n\nprincipais sistemas tect\u00f3nicos activos no Golfo de C\u00e1dis: as falhas SWIM e os \n\ncavalgamentos NE-SW. \n\n\n\nIX \n\n \n\n Por \u00faltimo, os resultados apresentados neste trabalho favorecem um cen\u00e1rio \n\ntect\u00f3nico hipot\u00e9tico no qual a actividade da zona de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o presente sob o Arco de \n\nGibraltar tem vindo a decrescer desde o Mioc\u00e9nico, ao mesmo tempo que uma zona de \n\nsubduc\u00e7\u00e3o incipiente poder\u00e1 estar a desenvolver-se na Margem Sudoeste Ib\u00e9rica. O \n\nGolfo de C\u00e1dis pode assim ser visto como um local onde a proximidade de uma zona de \n\nsubduc\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9-existente poder\u00e1 estar a induzir a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma nova zona de \n\nsubduc\u00e7\u00e3o no Atl\u00e2ntico.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Inicia\u00e7\u00e3o de subduc\u00e7\u00e3o; Golfo de C\u00e1dis; Mapa Tect\u00f3nico; Depress\u00f5es \n\nem forma de Crescente; Interfer\u00eancia Cavalgamento-Desligamento. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nX \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nXI \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n \n\nThis research project would not have been possible without the support of many \n\npeople.

Motivation \n\n \n\nEarth is a singular planet and plate tectonics is one of its most distinctive \n\nfeatures. Missions to other planets and moons revealed that the Earth is the only body in \n\nthe solar system with subduction zones and an active plate tectonic regime (Stern et al., \n\n2004; Stevenson, 2003). One of the most paradigmatic concepts in the plate tectonics \n\ntheory is the Wilson Cycle which states that oceans form, evolve and close (Wilson, \n\n1966). This dynamic process is based on the fact that the Earth\u2018s lithosphere is \n\ncomposed of several plates separated by three types of boundaries: divergent, transform \n\nand convergent (Isacks et al., 1968; Vine and Hess, 1970). Subduction zones are the \n\nconvergent boundaries where oceanic lithosphere is recycled in the mantle, allowing the \n\ndifferentiation of continents and heat transfer from the Earth\u2018s interior (Stern, 2002). \n\nThe Wilson Cycle requires that after a certain time of an ocean evolution, passive \n\nmargins are reactivated and subduction initiates. However, the process by which a \n\npassive margin converts into an active margin is still controversial and fundamentally \n\nunknown (e.g. Mueller and Philips, 1991; Stern, 2002 and 2004; Gurnis et al., 2004; \n\nNikolaeva, et al., 2010). Despite the abundance of both passive and active continental \n\nmargins on Earth, no obvious cases of transition between these two types of margins \n\nhave been identified so far (Nikolaeva, et al., 2010). One way to overcome this apparent \n\nparadox is to consider that subduction initiation may generally be induced by the \n\nproximity of another subduction zone or by stress transference from a near collision \n\nbelt. Therefore, passive margins in the proximity of a mature subduction complex would \n\nrepresent preferential sites for trench formation (Mueller and Philips, 1991). \n\nThe Atlantic margins are generally described as the typical case of passive \n\nmargins (Gibbs, 1984). However, there are at least two regions where Atlantic oceanic \n\nlithosphere is being consumed in subduction zones: in the Scotia and in the Lesser \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nAntilles arcs (Deuser, 1970; Schellart and Lister, 2004; Fig. 1.1). These subduction \n\nzones seem to have been transferred from the Eastern Pacific ocean to the Atlantic \n\ndomain (Mueller and Phillips, 1991; Royden, 1993; Goren et al., 2008). These arcs \n\npotentially represent precursors to a system of convergent zones that might ultimately \n\nresult in the destruction of the Atlantic Ocean (Mueller and Phillips, 1991). The Gulf of \n\nCadiz, i.e. the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc (Figs. 1.1 and 1.2), is the third place that \n\nwas described as a potential locus for subduction to propagate to open Atlantic (Royden, \n\n1993). On the other hand, the proximity of the Gibraltar collision belt to the Southwest \n\nIberia Margin (see Fig. 1.2), together with the existing overall convergence between \n\nAfrica and Iberia, induces compressive stresses that make this margin a strong candidate \n\nfor the nucleation of a new subduction zone. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Simplified tectonic map of the Atlantic and surrounding regions with the location of the \n\nAtlantic arcs (Scotia, Lesser Antilles and Gibraltar). Thick black lines indicate convergent plate \n\nboundaries; thick gray lines indicate divergent or transform plate boundaries (Adapted from Schellart and \n\nLister, 2004); grey areas roughly correspond to back-arc basins. \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n1.2. The Gulf of Cadiz \n\n \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, west of the Gibraltar \n\nStraits, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco (Fig. 1.2). It corresponds to the transition \n\nzone between the Mediterranean Alpine Collision Belt and the Atlantic Azores \u2013 \n\nGibraltar Fracture Zone (AGFZ), encompassing a puzzling segment of the Africa-\n\nEurasia plate boundary. Although in this region the nature of the boundary is not yet \n\nentirely understood and it is subject of a debate, geological and geophysical data point \n\nto the existence of a non-discrete lithospheric limit. In accordance, some authors \n\ndescribed this region as a diffuse plate boundary (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994; Morel and \n\nMeghraoui, 1996; Medialdea et al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009), in \n\nwhich several differently oriented tectonic structures, mainly Northwestwards directed \n\nthrusts and W-E to WNW-ESE wrench faults, are responsible for the dissipation of the \n\ncompressive stress associated to a WNW-ESE Present day convergence between \n\nEurasia (Iberia sub-plate) and Africa (Nubia sub-plate) at a rate of ca. 4 mm/yr (Argus \n\net al., 1989; DeMets et al., 1994; Sella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., \n\n2003; Fernandes, 2004; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Fernandes et al., 2007). \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz area has been proposed as the locus of the 1755 Great Lisbon \n\nEarthquake (estimated magnitude of 8.5 to 8.9; Abe et al, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Batista \n\net al., 1998; Martinez-Solares and Arroyo, 2004) that originated a devastating tsunami \n\nand destroyed the Portuguese capital (Baptista et al., 1998; Zitellini et al., 2001; \n\nMartinez-Solares and Arroyo, 2004). The precise location of its source is subject of \n\nongoing debate (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998; Buforn et al., 1998; Zitellini et al., 2001; \n\nGutscher et al., 2002; Gutscher, 2004;  Gracia et al., 2003b; Terrinha et al., 2003; \n\nGutscher, 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009). Major efforts were made to map the main \n\ntectonic structures that historical and instrumental seismic events have shown to be \n\npotentially capable of generating moderate to high magnitude earthquakes (e.g.  Ms=7.9 \n\nand Mw=6.0, 28/02/1969 and 12/02/2007 earthquakes respectively; Fukao, 1973 and \n\nStich et al., 2006, 2007). New findings emerged from the interpretation of a great \n\nvariety of recently acquired data (e.g. multibeam swath bathymetry, reflection and \n\nrefraction seismics, geodetic), which allowed a better understanding of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz tectonic evolution (e.g. Johnston, 1996, Gonzalez et al., 1996; Zitellini et al., \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n2001; Gutscher et al., 2002, 2009a,b; Baptista et al., 2003; Gracia et al., 2003a,b; \n\nMulder et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2004; Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; \n\nZitellini et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Simplified tectonic map of the Gulf of Cadiz area (Adapted from Duarte et al., 2010; TAP \n\nFault from Cunha et al., 2010; bathymetry and altimetry from the SWIM compilation published in \n\nZitellini et al., 2009). GCAW - Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge; SWIM faults - dashed white lines. \n\nBlack dots - mud volcanoes (Hensen et al., 2007; Duarte et al., 2010). Inset in the upper left showing (in \n\nblack) average direction of the Maximum Horizontal Stresses\u2014SHmax, and (in grey) the direction of the \n\n4 mm/yr convergence rate between Nubia and Iberia (Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich et al., 2006; \n\nFernandes et al., 2007). Inset in the upper right showing the location of the Gulf of Cadiz area in the \n\ngeneral tectonic setting of the western Nubia - Eurasia plate boundary. \n\n \n\n Gutscher et al. (2002), building on previously ideas put forward by other authors \n\n(e.g. Royden, 1993; Lonergan and White, 1997), considered the tectonic evolution of \n\nthis area as being dominated by active retreating subduction along an E-W oceanic \n\ncorridor, caused by the roll-back of an east-dipping lithospheric slab, presently \n\npositioned underneath the Gibraltar Arc (Figs. 1.3 and 1.4A). This hypothesis is \n\ncompatible with the geodetic data that show a portion of the Gibraltar Arc moving \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nsouthwestwards relatively to a stable Iberia at a rate of ca. 3.5 mm/yr, and obliquely to \n\nAfrica (Fig 1.4B; Stich et al., 2006; Fernandes et al., 2007; Tahayt et al., 2008). On the \n\nother hand, the West Iberia Margin also shows evidences of tectonic reactivation (see \n\nFig. 1.4A and C), possibly as the consequence of the westward movement of the \n\nGibraltar Arc and of the present WNW-ESE trajectory of Nubia in relation to Iberia \n\n(Terrinha et al., 2009). In this context, two end members of working hypothesis/models \n\ncan be envisaged: (1) The Gulf of Cadiz subduction zone is active and retreating \n\ntowards open Atlantic (Gutscher et al., 2002), comparable to what happened in the \n\nScotia and Lesser Antilles arcs; (2) The subduction is blocked/inactive and the \n\nSouthwest Portuguese Margin is being reactivated and possibly constitutes an example \n\nof an incipient subduction (Ribeiro et al., 1996). Recently, another significant tectonic \n\nfeature was indentified in the Gulf of Cadiz: the SWIM faults system (Duarte et al., \n\n2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). These faults were proposed to be the \n\nexpression a newly formed plate boundary, corresponding to a broad transpressive \n\ndeformation band, connecting the Gibraltar Arc to the compressive structures in the \n\nSouthwest Iberia Margin (Zitellini et al., 2009; see Figs. 1.2 and 1.4C).  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Sections from nonlinear inversion of global earthquake traveltime data (Bijwaard and \n\nSpakman, 2000; Gutsher et al., 2002).

This anomaly was \n\ninterpreted as a slab of Mesozoic oceanic lithosphere (see scheme on the right; Spakman and Wortel, \n\n2004). C-C\u2018 and D-D9\u2018 North-south cross sections show a narrow ?slab?

Aim of the work \n\n \n\nThe initial motivation of this work was to investigate the role that orogenic arcs \n\nmay have in the reactivation of passive margins, using the Gulf of Cadiz (foreland of the \n\nGibraltar arc) and the Southwest Iberia (passive) Margin as a case study. In this context, \n\nthis Ph.D. thesis specifically aims at: a) unraveling the main tectonic structures in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz, producing a new up-dated tectonic map of the region, based on the \n\ninterpretation of recently acquired bathymetric and seismic data; b) unravel the present \n\nday tectonics of this key segment of the Iberia-Nubia plate boundary, based on the \n\ninterpretation of the mapped structures, seeking to know what are dominant tectonic \n\ndriven mechanisms: the overall convergence between Africa and Eurasia, the westward \n\nmovement of the Gibraltar Arc, or both; and c) test previous models, and newly \n\nproposed assumptions, through analogue (physical) modeling experiments.  \n\nThe body of the manuscript is structured in eight Chapters. The first three \n\nChapters correspond to the introduction of the problematic at stake and the used \n\nmethods; the fourth chapter corresponds to the up-dated tectonic map of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz region; and the following three chapters are structured as research papers \n\n(including Duarte et al., 2010; Duarte et al., submitted; and Duarte, in prep.). A final \n\nchapter of conclusions is also included in the body of the manuscript. Three research \n\npapers in which the author of the thesis is co-author and were also part of the work \n\ninvolved in this PhD project are incorporated as appendixes (Terrinha et al., 2009; \n\nRosas et al., 2009; Rosas et al., submitted), together with another paper published by the \n\nauthor (Duarte et al., 2009)  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \nMain acknowledged concepts \n\n \n\n2.1. Subduction zones \n\n \n\nPlanet Earth has a cool strong external layer named lithosphere. This layer is \n\nfragmented in several tectonic plates moving in relation to each other with convergent, \n\ndivergent or transform kinematics above the less viscous and weaker asthenosphere. \n\nSubduction is the process that takes place at convergent boundaries by which one \n\ntectonic plate, typically more dense, sinks under another into the mantle (Fig. 2.1). The \n\noceanic lithosphere becomes denser than the underlying asthenosphere within 20-50 Ma \n\nafter it forms (Oxburgh &amp; Parmentier, 1977; Davis, 1992). At this stage the lithosphere \n\nbecomes unstable and subduction initiation is the Earth\u2018s way to maintain its \n\nthermodynamic equilibrium (Stern, 2004). In this context, subduction zones are the \n\nthree-dimensional manifestation of the Earth convective downwelling, and arc-trench \n\ncomplexes are the crustal manifestations of a subduction zone operating beneath it \n\n(Stern, 2002). Subduction zones are defined by the inclined array of earthquakes known \n\nas the Wadati-Benioff Zone (red stars in Fig. 2.1).  \n\nOne paradigmatic idea of the early Plate Tectonic Theory was that mantle \n\nthermal convection moves the lithosphere, dragging the plates as it moves (Holmes, \n\n1929; Mckenzie, 1969). This idea is deeply rooted in the scientific and pedagogic \n\ncommunity and it is generally spread among tectonics introductory books (Stern, 2004). \n\nHowever, it is now widely accepted that Earth\u2018s mantle convects mostly because cold \n\nlithosphere sinks at subduction zones (Elsasser, 1967; Hager &amp; O\u2018Connell, 1981; Davis \n\n&amp; Richards, 1992; Hamilton, 2003; Stern, 2004). The base of the continents may be \n\nlocally dragged by the circulating mantle but is the slab pull (and slab suction), resulting \n\nfrom the negative buoyancy of the cooler and denser lithosphere at subduction zones, \n\nthat drives the tectonic plates (see Fig. 2.1; Elsasser, 1971; Forsyth and Uyeda, 1975; \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nBott and Kusznier, 1984; Davis, 1992; Anderson, 2002; Conrad &amp; Lithgow-Bertelloni, \n\n2002; Hamilton, 2003). Elder (1976), based on laboratory models, also concluded that \n\nthere is no direct link between asthenospheric flow and plate motion, and thus plates \n\ncannot be driven by ?mantle drag? (Park, 1988). According with Lithgow-Bertelloni \n\nand Richards (1995) 90% of the force needed to move the plates is caused by the \n\nsinking of lithospheric slabs in subduction zones (slab pull), as the other 10% is \n\noriginated in the rift zones, consequence of oceanic spreading (ridge push; Stern, 2004).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Sketch illustrative of the two main forces driving plate tectonics: slab pull and ridge push \n\n(Extracted from UCSD-SIO15: Natural Disasters Course). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.1. When did subduction begin? \n\n \n\nOne of the major challenges in modern geology is to understand how and where \n\nsubduction initiates. To address this problem it is important to try to recognize when the \n\nPresent plate tectonic regime was established on Earth and when did subduction become \n\na dominant process. Given the present state of knowledge on planetary evolution, it is \n\nnot reasonable to assume that the Earth had the same tectonic regime for the last 4.4 Ga. \n\nIt is known that Earth was hotter in the past and consequently both crustal and mantle \n\nprocesses, including subduction, changed throughout the planet cooling process \n\n(Hamilton, 2003). For instance, if subduction is strongly dependent on the density \n\nincrease of the oceanic crust, and this increase is the result of its cooling, it is possible to \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nassume that in the past, due to the higher planet\u2018s temperature, the crust probably did \n\ncool slowly and thus would take more time to become unstable and start to subduct. \n\nAlso, the high heat flux probably caused high crustal melting and thickening. Given that \n\nthe crust is much less denser than the asthenosphere, a thicker crust would inhibit \n\nlithosphere to sink (Stern, 2004). With this reasoning becomes clear that plate tectonics \n\nrequires a planet to be in delicate thermal equilibrium (Sleep, 2000). Plate tectonics can \n\nalways be shut down either by rift lock, if the mantle is too cold to allow adiabatic \n\nmelting, or by trench lock, if the mantle is to hot that oceanic crust becomes too thick to \n\nsubduct (Stern, 2004). \n\nRecent studies indicate that the Earth did not have a conventional tectonic plate \n\nregime for a major part of its history. It is generally accepted that before 1.0 to 2.0 Ga \n\nthe Earth\u2018s surface was not cold enough to sustain plate tectonic and subduction zones \n\n(Kontinen, 1987; Scott et al., 1992; Davis, 1992; Davis and Richards, 1992; Kuski, \n\n2001; Hamilton, 2003; Stern, 2004). According to Hamilton (2003) the crust and upper \n\nmantle have formed a mostly closed system throughout geologic time, and their \n\ntemporal changes are responses to cooling. The changing processes define a Punctuated \n\nGradualism rather than the classical Uniformitarianism (Hamilton, 2003). Major stages \n\nin Earth evolution are (Hamilton, 2003):  \n\n(1) 4.567\u2013ca. 4.4 Ga. Hot accretion and major irreversible mantle fractionation;  \n\n(2) 4.4\u20133.5 Ga. Era of nearly global felsic crust, too hot and mobile to stand as \n\ncontinents;  \n\n(3) 3.5\u20132.0 Ga. Granite-and-greenstone era. Permanent hydrosphere. Old crust \n\ncooled to density permitting mafic melts to reach surface. Diapiric batholiths mobilized \n\nfrom underlying old crust; \n\n(4) 2.0 Ga\u2013continuing. Plate tectonic era. Distinct continents and oceans. Top-\n\ndown cooling of oceanic lithosphere enables subduction that drives plates and forces \n\nspreading. \n\nAlso new planetary geological data, resulting from the studies of silicate planets \n\nand moons in the Solar System, allowed the recognition of three general states of \n\nplanetary evolution based on different mantle convection modes: 1) magma ocean, 2) \n\nplate tectonics and 3) stagnant lid (Sleep, 2000). Mercury, Venus and Mars, despite the \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nexistence of some mantle convection, are presently recognized to be in the stagnant lid \n\nstate. Actually, Venus may be in the transition stage from plate tectonic to stagnant lid \n\n(Stevenson, 2003). The understanding of the geodynamical past and present of the other \n\nplanets and moons is one of the most promising investigation lines in the planetary \n\ngeology discipline, which may help to comprehend Earth\u2018s evolution and its past \n\ngeodynamical regimes. Specifically, it is crucial to understand if the Earth\u2018s plate \n\ntectonic regime with subduction zones is exclusive from our planet or if it might exist or \n\nhave existed in other rocky bodies.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Subduction initiation at passive margins \n\n \n\nDespite the widespread occurrence of subduction zones in our planet, the \n\nprocess by which a passive margin converts into an active margin is still highly \n\ncontroversial and fundamentally unknown (Stern, 2002; 2004; Gurnis et al., 2004; \n\nNikolaeva et al., 2010). It is traditionally assumed that spontaneous subduction \n\ninitiation at passive margins occurs when the gravitational unstable oceanic lithosphere \n\ncollapses into the asthenosphere, consequence of density excess resulting from \n\nlithosphere aging. This process is a corollary of the Wilson Cycle and has been for long \n\nthe most widely accepted model for trench formation (e.g. Vlaar and Wortel, 1976; \n\nDavies, 1999). However, several works showed that the strength of the oceanic \n\nlithosphere also increases with age and thus its aging by itself does not make it more \n\nsusceptible to spontaneously collapse in the asthenosphere (Fig. 2.2; McKenzie, 1977; \n\nCloetingh et al., 1984; Mueller and Phillips, 1991). This conclusion is supported by the \n\nexistence of 170 Ma old oceanic crust adjacent to the NW Africa and NE America \n\npassive margins. In addition, according to Mueller and Phillips (1991), the geological \n\nrecord does not reveal a single example of an Atlantic-type margin evolving into an \n\nAndean-type without the intervening of an arc-continent collision. One way to explain \n\nsubduction initiation is to consider that it may be induced by the proximity of another \n\nsubduction zone or by stress transference from a near collision belt. Therefore, fractured \n\npassive margins and transform faults in the proximity of a mature subduction complex \n\nwould represent preferential sites for trench formation (Mueller and Phillips, 1991). \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Minimum force (per unit of distance) required to promote incipient lithospheric convergence \n\nwithin normal oceanic lithosphere as function of fault plane angle. Lithosphere of all ages (t) is capable of \n\nwithstanding compressional stresses associated with ridge push (that are of the order of 10\n12\n\n N/m). This is \n\nwhy seafloor does not spontaneously founder upon achieving negative buoyancy (Extracted from Mueller \n\nand Phillips, 1991). Note that slab pull forces may exceed 10\n14\n\n N/m and typically are about 5 x 10\n13\n\n N/m \n\n(Mueller and Phillips, 1991). \n\n \n\nStern (2004), in its seminal paper, argues that in principle subduction zones can \n\nform by two distinct ways: induced or spontaneous. In its simpler form induced \n\nsubduction results from the continued plate convergence after a subduction fails due to \n\ncontinental collision, leading to the formation of a new subduction out of the collision \n\nzone. Note that in the case of induced subduction initiation the plates are already \n\nconverging before the new subduction forms. In Figure 2.3 it is shown how this \n\ncontinued convergence can trigger the formation of a new subduction zone. Two sub-\n\ncases are distinguished: transference and polarity reversal. Induced initiation by \n\ntransference occurs when a less dense buoyant continental bloc or submarine plateau \n\napproaches (or even enters) the subduction zone and causes it to fail. As consequence, a \n\nnew subduction forms outboard of the collision zone (see fig. 2.3). Induced subduction \n\nby polarity reversal also occurs when a buoyant block approaches the trench. However, \n\ncontrary to the transference case, the subduction nucleates in the original overriding \n\nplate (Stern, 2004).  \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 General classes, subclasses and examples of how subduction zones form (Extracted from \n\nStern, 2004). \n\n \n\nIn Figure 2.3 are also shown two possible ways for a subduction to initiate \n\nspontaneously: passive margin collapse and transform collapse. The first corresponds to \n\nthe model of passive margin collapse due to density excess and sedimentary loading \n\ntraditionally required for the closing phase of the Wilson cycle. In this examples \n\nconvergence only start after the subduction, corresponding to a newly formed plate \n\nboundary, is completely developed. However, as mentioned above, it is known that \n\nlithosphere becomes more rigid with aging and thus this process requires some kind of \n\nweakening mechanism like serpentinization or the existence of a pre-fractured \n\nextensional zone, since lithosphere easily fails when subjected to traction forces \n\n(Clothing et al., 1989; Stern, 2004). Furthermore, Stern (2004) shows that there is no \n\nknown example of spontaneous subduction nucleation in the Cenozoic, and that Pre-\n\nCenozoic examples should be avoided because the evidences are ambiguous and \n\nreconstructions more conjectural. Also, Mueller and Philips (1991) demonstrate that \n\nsimple models of passive margin collapse cannot be quantitatively substantiated and are \n\nnot evident in the geological record. Nevertheless, if plate tectonics started sometime in \n\nthe Precambrian and plates are driven by slab pull at subduction zones, then \n\nspontaneous nucleation of at least one subduction zone is required to first set the plates \n\nin motion (Stern, 2004), unless there was a progressive transition mode, from the ?pre-\n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nplate-tectonics? regime to the present-day plate tectonics regime, in which segments of \n\nthe lithosphere were already sinking in the asthenosphere.  \n\nFigure 2.3 also shows another possible way for a spontaneous initiation of \n\nsubduction: along a transform boundary or a fracture zone. This may occur when one of \n\ntwo juxtaposed plates collapse as consequence of density differences. However, recent \n\ngeodynamical modeling carried out by Hall et al. (2003) demonstrate that this process \n\nrequires a previous plate convergence of about 2 cm/yr to overcome plate strength \n\n(Stern, 2004).  \n\nNikolaeva et al. (2010) synthesized several previously proposed \n\nforces/mechanisms/processes besides slab pull and ridge push that could account for \n\nsubduction initiation (Table 2.1), however, the ongoing debate on this topic in the \n\nscientific community is still far from a consensus. Some authors even proposed that \n\nsubduction initiated on the Earth by exogenic processes such as meteorite impacts \n\n(Hansen, 2007). There is not even agreement on whether old passive margins constitute \n\nlikely sites for subduction initiation, as required by the traditional closing phase of the \n\nWilson cycle. Thus, the identification of an incipient subduction at a passive margin is \n\none of the major challenges in the modern plate tectonics. A natural case study would \n\npermit to constrain the previously vast amount of proposed models and allow a better \n\nunderstanding of one of the most enigmatic processes on Earth: the formation of a \n\nsubduction zone. In the present work, we explore the possibility of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\ntectonic setting as being one natural case of subduction initiation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 \u2013 Several proposed hypothesis for subduction initiation (Adapted from Nikolaeva et al., 2010) \n\n \n\nForces/Processes/Mechanisms \n\n \n\n \n\nExamples in literature \n\nPlate rupture within an oceanic plate or at a \n\npassive margin. \n\nMcKenzie, 1977; Dickinson and Seely, 1979; \n\nMitchell, 1984; Mueller and Phillips, 1991 \n\n \n\nReversal of the polarity of an existing \n\nsubduction zone. \n\n \n\nMitchell, 1984 \n\nChange of transform faults into trenches.

On the closure of the Atlantic Ocean \n\n  \n\nThe absence on Earth of oceanic crust older than 200 Ma, with the exception of \n\na small portion of Tethyan crust in the eastern Mediterranean (Fig. 2.4), suggests that \n\nnew subduction systems should initiate repeatedly (Goren et al., 2008). Passive margins \n\nare the reasonable place for trench formation since most of the existing subduction \n\nzones are located along continental margins (Goren et al., 2008; Nikolaeva et al., 2010). \n\nAlso, the current state of relatively young oceanic lithosphere is best achieved by \n\nsubducting the oldest oceanic lithosphere, which occurs at passive margins, before \n\nyounger oceanic lithosphere (Goren et al., 2008; Nikolaeva et al., 2010).  \n\nThe oldest oceanic lithosphere in the Atlantic basin is about 170 Ma, preferably \n\nlocated near the passive margins that almost entirely bound this ocean (see Fig. 2.4). \n\nAccording to some authors, the Atlantic has already entered in its closing phase (e.g. \n\nMueller and Philips, 1991; Ribeiro et al., 2006). In fact, there are already two places \n\nwhere Atlantic oceanic crust is being consumed in subduction zones: in the Scotia arc \n\nand in the Lesser Antilles arc (Deuser, 1970; Goren et al., 2008; see Figs. 1.1 and 2.4). \n\nThese arcs may be the precursors of a system of convergence zones that might \n\nultimately result in the closing of the Atlantic Ocean (Mueller and Philips, 1991).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Worldwide map of the oceanic lithosphere age (Extracted from Muller et al., 2008). \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n2.2.1. The Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs \n\n \n\nThe Scotia and the Lesser Antilles arcs (see Fig. 1.1) seem to correspond to two \n\ncases of induced subduction initiation. Some authors proposed that once existed a \n\ncontinuous east deeping subduction system extending from NW American margin to the \n\nAntarctica (e.g. Goren et al., 2008; Fig. 2.5A). The two narrow continental landmasses \n\nexisting between the Pacific and the Atlantic (marked with ellipses in Fig. 2.5) may \n\nhave allowed the transmission of stress between basins, inducing the nucleation of two \n\nsubduction zones in Atlantic domain (Fig. 2.5B). According with Mueller and Phillips \n\n(1991), in the Caribbean region the Pacific and Atlantic crust may even had been in \n\ndirect contact by a corridor of oceanic crust generated during a rifting phase between \n\nNorth and South America. Goren et al. (2008) speculated that the nucleation of the \n\nAtlantic subductions was facilitated by the addition of water and melts into the upper \n\ncontinental plates, weakening it and reducing its viscosity (see Fig. 2.5C). Both the \n\nScotia and the Lesser Antilles arcs then retreated around 2000 km to their present \n\nposition. The subduction of Atlantic seafloor occurred simultaneously with seafloor \n\nspreading in the back-arcs. Having reached the open ocean, the advance across oceanic \n\nlithosphere is essentially unhampered because an almost limitless supply of negatively \n\nbuoyant lithosphere is available to drive subduction (Royden, 1993).  \n\nMueller and Phillips (1991) used an interesting and, in accordance with the \n\nauthors, particularly imaginative analogy. They consider that the introduction of \n\nsubduction zones into a previously pristine oceanic basin (i.e. without subduction zones) \n\nmight be viewed, figuratively, as a contagious process in which an ?infected? ocean (i.e. \n\nwith subduction zones) infects an uninfected basin. Once that the first subduction zone \n\nhas invaded the pristine ocean the potential to multiply and eradicate the entire basin \n\nclearly exists. The exact form by which this process may occur is still unclear and in \n\nsome extent speculative. Nevertheless, two additional important characteristics of the \n\nScotia and Lesser Antilles arcs are conspicuous. Firstly, both these arcs are retreating \n\nbounded by transform faults and trenches that do not seem to be propagating laterally \n\n(see Fig. 1.1.). Secondly, both the Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs are propagating along \n\ntwo transform plate boundaries that connect the arcs to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (see \n\nFigs. 1.1 and 2.4). There is a striking similarity between these two arcs and the Gibraltar \n\nArc (see Fig. 1.1), which is also connected to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by the Azores-\n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nGibraltar Fracture Zone, a transform plate limit extending from the Azores triple \n\njunction to the Gulf of Cadiz, the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc (see Figs. 1.1 and 1.2). \n\nThis work investigates the possibility of this area to correspond to the third place where \n\nan initial stage of the subduction ?infection? process might be occurring at present, in \n\naccordance with some ideas addressed by Mueller and Phillips (1991) and Royden, \n\n(1993).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 (a) Paleo-tectonic configuration of the Americas during the Late Cretaceous, showing a \n\ncontinuous subduction system to the west of the continents (marked by black triangles), and narrow \n\ncontinental masses (black ellipses). (b) Paleo-tectonic configuration of the Americas during middle \n\nMiocene, showing two new segments of subduction, the Lesser Antilles and South Sandwich (Scotia) \n\narcs, to the east of the continents, correlated with the locations of the narrow continental strips. (c) \n\nSchematic model (proposed by Goren et al., 2008) of the lithosphere-asthenosphere structure along \n\nsection AB as appears in plate a. Subduction beneath a narrow continental lithosphere is favorable for the \n\ndevelopment of lateral density contrast that may lead to low-angle subduction. Subduction system with \n\neast dipping slab is active to the west of a narrow strip of continental lithosphere. Water and melts \n\ninduced by the active subduction infiltrate into the upper continental plate, weaken it and reduce its \n\ndensity and viscosity. As a result, a density contrast develops between the narrow continental lithosphere \n\nand the oceanic lithosphere to its east. Then, low-angle subduction to the east of the continent with a west \n\ndipping slab may develop (Extracted and adapted from Goren et al., 2008). \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n2.2.2. The Gibraltar Arc and West Portuguese Margin \n\n \n\nThe subduction zone now present beneath the Gibraltar Arc developed within \n\nthe Mediterranean Alpine Collision Belt and is a remnant of the subduction system that \n\nconsumed most of the Western Mediterranean Tethyan Ocean (see bellow section 2.3). \n\nRoyden et al. (1993) suggested that this subduction is still retreating westwards toward \n\nAtlantic domain (see Fig., 1.1). This idea was at the time somehow speculative and \n\nlacking the support of geophysical data. Also, further works presented by Lonergan and \n\nWhite (1997) and Maldonado et al. (1999) suggested that the subduction was inactive \n\nsince Miocene times. The idea of a present day active slab roll back was re-introduced \n\nby Gutscher et al. (2002) who related the existence of an east dipping slab below the \n\nGibraltar Arc (Bijwaard and Spakman, 2000) to the presence of a west verging \n\naccretionary wedge (GCAW) in the Atlantic domain (see Figs. 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4). The \n\nauthors proposed that the slab is retreating along an East-West corridor of oceanic \n\nlithosphere that once connected the Tethyan and the Atlantic oceanic basins (Fig. 2.6; \n\nsee section 2.3). Several authors still argue that the Gibraltar subduction system is no \n\nlonger active (e.g. Zitellini et al., 2009) or that it had diminished dramatically its activity \n\nsince latest Miocene times (Terrinha et al., 2009). According to Terrinha et al. (2009), \n\nthe present stress regime caused the migration of the deformation from the realm of the \n\nGCAW to the west (onto the Horseshoe fault region; Fig. 2.7) and to the north along the \n\nWest Portuguese Margin. The 300 km long NE\u2013SW trending fault system (Horseshoe, \n\nMarqu\u00eas do Pombal, Gorringe and Tagus Abyssal Plain faults; see Figs. 2.7 and 1.2) is \n\nconsidered by the authors as the expression of the propagation of a new compressive \n\ndeformation front, which will eventually lead to the nucleation of a West Iberian \n\nsubduction zone, as proposed by Ribeiro et al. (1996; Fig. 2.8). In addition, the \n\ntomography data presented in Gutscher et al. (2002) suggests that the Horseshoe Fault \n\nmay penetrate at least till 100 km in the lithosphere. On the other hand, Masson et al. \n\n(1994) also speculated that subduction may be nucleating further north in the Iberian \n\nAbyssal Plain ocean-continent transition (see Fig. 2.8). Here a thinned rifted crust is \n\noverlying a body of serpentinized peridotite. Serpentinization can provide an efficient \n\nweakening mechanism that may facilitate lithospheric rupture and subduction initiation \n\n(Cloetingh et al., 1984; Masson et al., 1994) \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 - Relief map of Southern Iberia region with location of arcuate structures, along the trend of \n\nthe straits of Gibraltar, shown in map view (see explanation in figure).

Was the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake triggered in a \n\nsubduction zone? \n\n \n\n The 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 8.5 to 8.9 and \n\nis one of the highest magnitude earthquakes in the history of Europe (Johnston, 1996; \n\nBatista et al., 1998). Several structures were proposed to be the source of this \n\nearthquake: e.g. the Gorringe Bank (Johnston, 1996), the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault \n\n(Zitellini et al., 2001) and the Tagus Valley fault (Vilanova et al., 2003). However, the \n\nempirical relationships proposed by Wells and Coppersmith (1994) indicate that such \n\nrelease of elastic energy requires a rupture area of approximately 27,000 km\n2\n and a fault \n\nlength of around 370 km (Gutscher et al., 2009a). Since the above structures are not \n\nlong enough to produce such energy (see Figs. 2.7 and 1.2), they were progressively \n\nabandoned as possible sources. To overcome this difficulty, other models proposed the \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nexistence of two faults acting simultaneously to generate the 1755 event by adding up \n\ntheir rupture areas: e.g. the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault and the Horseshoe fault (Terrinha \n\net al., 2003; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; see Fig. 2.7) and the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault and \n\nthe Guadalquivir Bank Fault (Baptista et al., 2003). Also, Zitellini et al. (2009) proposed \n\na possible link between the Horseshoe and the SWIM faults that together can comprise \n\nin total more than 400 km of connected fault segments (see Fig. 1.2). This last \n\nhypothesis was investigated in detail by Rosas et al (submitted) and is also part of the \n\nwork involved in this PhD project (see appendix).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 - A) Structural map of the Southwest Portuguese Margin with a compilation of stress \n\nindicators and focal mechanisms.

(2002) and Gutscher (2004) proposed that the 1755 \n\nGreat Lisbon Earthquake was generated in the Gibraltar subduction fault plane. Their \n\nargument was mostly based on extensive geological and geophysical data, but also in \n\nthe fact that most of the large magnitude earthquakes (M?8.5) are generated in \n\nsubduction zones. Accordingly, 11 of the 12 greatest earthquakes (M?8.5) of the past \n\n100 years occurred along subduction fault planes (the exception was a magnitude 8.6 \n\nearthquake in the Himalaya collision belt). However, the Gulf of Cadiz subduction fault \n\nplane shows negligible instrumental high magnitude seismic events. Gutscher et al. \n\n(2006) offers three possible explanation for such an absence: (1) the subduction is \n\ninactive and has ceased; (2) the subduction is active, but aseismic; (3) the subduction is \n\nactive and a locked seimogenic zone exists, gradually accumulating stress until it \n\nreleases the next great earthquake, a similar behavior as the Nankai (SW Japan), \n\nCascadia (NW USA), and Northern Sumatra (Indonesia) subduction zones. Based on \n\nrecently acquired seafloor and GPS data the authors favor the last hypothesis.  \n\nRibeiro et al. (2006) agree that the source mechanism of such a large earthquake \n\nrequires generation at a subduction zone. However, they proposed that the source was \n\nnot the Gibraltar subduction, but an incipient subduction zone that is presently \n\ndeveloping in the West Iberia Margin (Fig. 2.8). Also Terrinha et al. (2009) proposed \n\nthat the Horseshoe, Marqu\u00eas de Pombal and Tagus Abyssal Plain compressive \n\nstructures (the crustal expression of this hypothetical incipient subduction zone; see Fig. \n\n2.7) may be linked at depth and thus providing a possible and reliable source \n\nmechanism for the generation of the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake.  \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 Regional geodynamical framework of Iberia and the incipient subduction at the West Iberia \n\nMargin as proposed by Ribeiro et al.

The Gulf of Cadiz geodynamic evolution \n\n \n\nThe tectonic features present in the Gulf of Cadiz (see Fig. 1.2) are the result of \n\na complex tectonic evolution including rifting, compression and strike-slip motion \n\nbetween Africa and Eurasia since the Triassic (Wilson et al., 1989; Dewey et al., 1989; \n\nMaldonado et al., 1999; Terrinha et al., 2009). During the Mesozoic, this area was part \n\nof the more occidental Alpine-Tethys rift system (see Fig. 2.9) that comprised an \n\noceanic domain separating two newly formed passive margins. (Dercourt et al., 1986; \n\nSanz de Galdeano, 1990; Srivastava et al, 1990a; 1990b; Maldonado et al., 1999; \n\nStampli et al., 2002). This domain included several spreading axes and transform faults \n\nthat formed as result of the extensional reactivation of Variscan structures (Terrinha, \n\n1998).  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Reconstructions of the Western Tethyan realm in the Aptian, Lower Cretaceous (~120 Ma.). \n\nNote the position of the Iberian Peninsula at the left top, before initiating its Cretaceous 35\u00ba \n\ncounterclockwise rotation (Stampli et al., 2002).  \n\n \n\nIn the Eocene-Oligocene most of the Gulf of Cadiz (and SW Iberia) Mesozoic \n\nrifting faults were tectonically inverted as the result of the convergence between Africa \n\nand Eurasia that started in the Upper Cretaceous (Terrinha et al., 2009). This \n\nconvergence was accommodated by northwards dipping subduction of the Alpine-\n\nTethys oceanic lithosphere that extended from the SE Iberia to the Alps (see Fig. 2.10; \n\nRehault et al., 1985; Malinverno and Ryan, 1986; Dewey et al., 1989; Rosenbaum et al., \n\n2002; Jolivet et al., 2006). Since the Oligocene, the continental collision in the Alps \n\nabsorbed the bulk compression of the Africa-Eurasia convergence, as consequence, the \n\nnorthwards Alpine-Tethys subduction along Europe\u2018s meridional margin slowed down \n\nand became primarily driven by the density collapse of the subducting oceanic slab \n\n(op.cit). This, triggered slab roll-back, which led to the formation of the West \n\nMediterranean back-arc basins and associated continental terranes, among which the \n\nBetic-Rif (Figs. 2.10 and 2.11; Rosenbaum et al., 2002, 2004). Concomitantly, the \n\nconvergence direction between Africa and Eurasia in the western Mediterranean region \n\nrotated progressively from the N-S to WNW-ESE (Maldonado et al., 1999; Fernandes et \n\nal., 2003; Fernandes, 2004). \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 \u2013 Reconstructions of the Western Mediterranean region in the Oligocene (~30 Ma.; \n\nRosenbaum et al., 2002).  Note the existence of an oceanic corridor connecting the Tethyan Liguarian \n\nOcean to the Atlantic and the position of the northwest dipping subduction before it started to retreat. \n\n \n\nIn the Middle Miocene, the continuation of the southwestwards drifting of the \n\nAlboran terrane (see Fig. 2.11) led to its collision with the SE Iberia and NW Africa \n\nforming the Gibraltar Arc (see Fig. 2.11; also known as Betic-Rif Arc). In the \n\nTortonian, the westward overthrusting of the Gibraltar Arc into Atlantic domain led to \n\nthe emplacement of an accretionary wedge in the Gulf of Cadiz (GCAW; see Figs. 1.2, \n\n2.6 and 2.11; Lonergan and White, 1997; Gutscher et al., 2002). It was recently \n\nconfirmed by geodetic data that the Gibraltar Arc region is moving westward at a rate of \n\nca. 3.5 mm/yr relatively to Iberia (Fadil et al., 2006; Stich et al., 2006; Tahayt et al., \n\n2008). According to Gutscher et al. (2002; 2009a) this movement is a consequence of \n\nthe active roll back of the east dipping oceanic slab that still exists between the Iberia \n\nand Africa plates as imaged by teleseismic tomography (Gutscher et al., 2002; Spakman \n\nand Wortel, Transmed Atlas, 2004). The existence of Tethyan oceanic lithosphere in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz beneath the accretionary wedge was recently confirmed using seismic \n\nrefraction data (Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011). This oceanic corridor can provide a path for the \n\nsubduction hinge retreat further west. \n\nPresently, the Gulf of Cadiz region experiences a large scale NW to WNW \n\ndirected convergence between Nubia and Iberia, at a rate of ca. 4 mm/yr (Argus et al., \n\n1989; DeMets et al., 1994; Sella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2003; \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nFernandes, 2004; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Fernandes et al., 2007). A general strain \n\npartitioning scenario (Terrinha et al., 2009) considers this convergence to be \n\naccommodated both along the WNW-ESE dextral strike-slip faults (including the \n\nSWIM faults), and along NE-SW westwards thrust faults, such as the Horseshoe, \n\nMarqu\u00eas de Pombal and Tagus Abyssal Plain faults and the Gorringe Bank northern \n\nthrust (see Figs.1.2 and 2.7). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11 \u2013 Schematic evolution of the Gibraltar Arc/Betic-Rif arc (Rosenbaum et al., 2004).

Therefore nearly all tectonic studies in marine environment \n\nrequire the use of geophysical methods. The present work was done based on the \n\ncombined analysis and interpretation of ca. 180,000 km\n2\n of high-resolution multibeam \n\nswath bathymetry and more than 20,700 km of multi-channel seismic reflection profiles. \n\nThe combination of bathymetric data and interpretation of the main tectonic structures \n\nin the seismic lines was the basis for a thorough morphotectonic characterization of the \n\nmain structural features of the Gulf of Cadiz, which resulted in the production of a new \n\ntectonic map of the region (see next chapter). Based on this new map several \n\ngeotectonic models regarding the interpretation of the tectonic evolution of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz were proposed. Different assumptions of these interpretations were tested using \n\nsandbox analogue modeling experiments. The obtained results provided new insights \n\nregarding several problems at stake, and, I hope, progress in the understanding of the \n\ntectonics of this key segment of the Iberia-Nubia plate boundary. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n3.1.

This project promoted a \n\ncollaborative research agreement to coordinate marine cruises with the goal of acquiring \n\nnew bathymetric data and making all existent data of the Gulf of Cadiz region available \n\nto the whole scientific community.  It resulted from the compilation of 19 surveys over \n\n200 days ship time, performed between 2000 and 2006 by teams belonging to 14 \n\nresearch institutions from 7 European countries (Table 3.1). Each institution provided \n\ndata files and Digital Terrain Models (DTM) at a 100 m grid spacing in order to produce \n\nthe SWIM multibeam compilation published and available online in Zitellini et al. \n\n(2009). Interpretation was made using terrain analysis techniques and image analysis of \n\nthe bathymetry using commercial software, ArcGIS and Fledermaus. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 The SWIM multibeam compilation (Zitellini et al., 2009).

The MCS profiles were acquired in the Gulf of Cadiz and \n\nWestern Iberia Margin, from 1992 through 2006, during the geophysical missions: \n\nARRIFANO, IAM, BIGSETS, VOLTAIRE, SISMAR and SWIM 2006 (Fig. 3.2).

Information on acquisition parameters and \n\ngeometry of these profiles is summarized in Table 3.2.

Analogue Modeling \n\n \n\nPhysical (analogue) modeling is the study of natural tectonic processes by means \n\nof simplified scaled models in laboratory. Physical modeling makes use of different \n\nmaterials, mostly granular and viscous with known properties, as analogues of natural \n\nrocks. The materials are chosen in order to fulfill the ?similarity criteria?, i.e. their \n\nphysical parameters and properties are chosen to mimic geometric, kinematic and \n\ndynamic natural conditions (Hubbert, 1937; Ramberg, 1967). The similarity criteria is \n\nachieved by scaling the model through an dimensional analysis assuring that the \n\ndimension, velocities and forces in the model are proportional to those in the prototype. \n\nThe purpose of analogue modeling is not simply to reproduce the natural prototype \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n(nature observations), but to test by controlled experiments hypotheses as to the driving \n\nmechanism of the tectonic processes (Ranalli, 2001).   \n\nIn the study of nature it is only possible to access the final stage of a tectonic \n\nprocess, and attempt to reconstruct the possible chronological sequence of events that \n\nled to that final stage (Eulerian approach). The major advantage of analogue modeling is \n\nthat it allows to simulate and test different possibilities of evolution of the original \n\nprototype, i.e. to reproduce in laboratory sequences of chronological events that may \n\nhave led to that specific final stage (Lagrangian approach), at a suitable geometric scale \n\nand time ratio (Ramberg, 1967). This is of special importance because different \n\nsequence of events may lead to the same final stage. Also, the fact of laboratory models \n\nbeing three dimensional make it a powerful tool in the gain of a qualitative mechanical \n\nintuition of the processes at stake and the thorough identification of patterns of \n\nrepeatability. Ideally, analogue modeling should be complemented with numerical \n\nmodeling, which allows a more efficient thermo-mechanical and analytical approach.  \n\nIn this work analogue modeling experiments were produced to better understand \n\nthe deformation patterns resulting from thrust-wrench fault interference in the study \n\narea. These experiments revealed to be crucial in the understanding of the driven \n\nmechanism that account for the observed structures present in the Gulf of Cadiz. The \n\nexperiments were designed according to fallowing steps:  \n\n1. Identification of a key problem; \n\n2. Determination of the materials that satisfy the similarity criteria (scaling); \n\n3. Building of the apparatus given the chosen scale; \n\n4. Running the experiments; \n\n5. Verification of the repeatability patterns of salient observables; \n\n6. Interpretation of the obtained results; \n\n7. Elaboration of a generalized explanatory theory or conceptual model \n\nintegrating the experimental results in coherent framework; \n\n8. Finally, integrate the modeling outcomes into the broader geodynamical \n\nevolution model of the studied area. \n\nSince this work is partially organized in research papers and in order to avoid \n\nrepetitions, all the experimental problematic, scaling, materials and used apparatus is \n\nprovided in the respective analogue modeling chapters and papers.  \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \nThe Gulf of Cadiz main tectonic \n\nfeatures \n \n\n In the last two decades several efforts were made to produce a tectonic map of \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz active structures (e.g. Tortella et al., 1997; Medialdea et al., 2004; \n\nIribarren et al., 2007; Zitellini et al., 2009; Fig. 4.1). Most of these maps were done \n\nusing one recently acquired MCS dataset or in other cases using datasets that covered \n\nthe study area in a non systematic manner. Usually the MCS surveys were obtained for \n\nthematic studies and not for the overall mapping of the Gulf of Cadiz. The novelty of \n\nthe map presented in this work (Fig. 4.2) is that it was made by a thorough review of a \n\nmulti-survey dataset (six MCS surveys) coupled with the analysis of the recently \n\ncompiled high resolution bathymetry, which provided detailed morpho-tectonic \n\ninformation at the scale of the whole study area (see previous chapter).  This map \n\nbenefited from the existence of a stratigraphic model by Roque (2007) which correlated \n\nthe different areas around SW Iberia. \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Four different tectonic maps of the Gulf of Cadiz region proposed in the last two decades: \n\nA) Tortella et al.

(2009). \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nThe map shown in Fig. 4.2 depicts the Gulf of Cadiz - SW Iberia main active \n\ntectonic structures. Three main systems of structures are promptly recognized: i) the \n\nsubduction-related Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (CGAW; marked in grey in Fig. \n\n4.2); ii) a set of WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-slip faults (the SWIM fault system; \n\nmarked in white); and a group of NE-SW striking northwest-directed thrusts located in \n\nthe Southwest Iberia Margin (marked in yellow). These three systems are described in \n\nseparated sections below. Other noteworthy structures depicted in the map of Fig. 4.2, \n\nsuch as the more ENE-WSW thrusts and the Cadiz fault, will also be briefly described \n\nin a fourth section. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 The tectonic map of the Gulf of Cadiz region and SW Iberia.

Profile A-B is presented in Figure 4.3. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\nThe tectonic map was made using an extensive dataset of stratigraphically \n\ncalibrated seismic reflection profiles (see Fig. 3.2). However, the seismic sections \n\npresented in this Chapter aim only to illustrate the main studied features and not to be an \n\nexhaustive characterization of all the structures present in the Gulf of Cadiz. Specially, \n\nbecause a significant part of these structures were previously characterized with some \n\ndetail in previous works (e.g. Gutscher et al., 2002; 2009a,b; Gracia et al., 2003a,b; \n\nTerrinha et al., 2003; Zitelini et al., 2004; Cunha et al., 2010) some of which included in \n\nother chapters and appendixes of this thesis (Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2009; \n\nRosas et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2010; Duarte et al., submitted; Rosas et al., submitted). \n\nThe adopted simplified stratigraphy is shown in Figure 4.3 (after Torelli et al., 1997; \n\nTortella et al., 1997; and Roque, 2007). In general, it is possible to identify three basic \n\nvariations (A, B and C in Fig. 4.3) of a stratigraphic column constituted by three main \n\ntectono-stratigraphic mega-sequences: i) a succession of mostly Mesozoic sediments, \n\noccasionally with some units extending through the Eocene-Oligocene, overlying a \n\nbasement of oceanic nature, with exception of the Gorringe Bank, a region where \n\nsediments lay directly on top of serpentinized mantle; ii) Miocene sediments often \n\nexhibiting a chaotic acoustic facies, including the Chaotic Body (which may locally \n\nincorporate sediments of Eocene-Oligocene age) and the GCAW; iii) an overlying \n\nsuccession of mostly Pliocene-Quaternary sediments. Some degree of stratigraphic \n\nlateral variations may occur between profiles or even within the same profile.  \n\n \nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Schematic W-E profile of the Gulf of Cadiz region (see Fig. 4.2 for location; not to scale) \n\nshowing the main representative tectono-stratigraphic mega-sequences, and three variations of a \n\nsimplified stratigraphic column (A, B and C), used in the interpretation of the seismic profiles presented \n\nin this work (after: Sartori et al., 2004; Torelli et al., 1997; Terrinha, 1998; Roque, 2007).  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n4.1. The Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge \n\n \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW) is one of the most prominent \n\nmorphological features depicted in the high-resolution bathymetry, occupying a \n\nsignificant area of the Gulf of Cadiz (see Figs. 4.2 and 4.4). It is materialized on the \n\nseafloor by a west dipping U-shaped surface that extends for more than 250 km from \n\nabout longitude 7\u00ba to 9\u00ba30\u2018, with depths ranging from 200 to 4300 meters. It narrows \n\nslightly to the west with a width varying from 160 to 140 km. Its northeastern limit is \n\nmarked by the Cadiz fault (see Fig. 4.2 and 4.4; Duarte et al., 2009) and the Iberian \n\ncontinental shelf. The northwestern part is limited by the uplifted continental slope of \n\nthe Portuguese margin, an area dominated by the presence of plateaus incised by \n\ncanyons and submarine valleys (see Fig. 4.2 and 4.4). The southern limit of the GCAW \n\nis well marked by the Rharb Valley that extends from the Moroccan continental shelf to \n\nthe Seine Abyssal Plain. To the west, the rim of the wedge corresponds to the eastern \n\nlimit of the Horseshoe Valley and the Seine Abyssal Plain. In this region, it is possible \n\nto observe that the wedge deformation front is asymmetrically indented by the Coral \n\nPatch Ridge (see Fig. 4.4; see Gutscher et al., 2009a).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 Perspective view (from southwest) of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW) \n\nsurface and adjacent areas (Adapted from Duarte et al., submitted) \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nThe present morphology of the GCAW is the result of the activity of a wide \n\nvariety of tectonic, gravitational and fluid escape processes. The particular wrinkled \n\nappearance of its surface comprises thrust-related slope breaks and associated folds, \n\n?raft-tectonics? type features, abundant sub-circular collapse depressions and several \n\nmud volcanoes and salt domes (Torelli et al., 1997; Mulder et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., \n\n2003; Gutscher et al., 2009b; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). From a \n\nstructural point of view, the GCAW corresponds to an eastward thickening pile of \n\nwestwards thrusted sediments (Fig. 4.5), reaching a maximum thickness of ca. 15 km \n\nnear the Gibraltar Straits (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006; Gutscher et al., 2009a). The \n\nthrusts are rooted in a common sub-horizontal to gently east dipping d\u00e9collement layer, \n\nexhibiting an overall geometry interpreted as compatible with on-going eastwards \n\nsubduction beneath the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002). During the last 5 Ma the \n\nE-W convergence rate implied in such a subduction is thought to have diminished from \n\nca. 2 cm/yr to 0.5 cm/yr (Gutscher et al., 2009a), with a consequent decrease in the \n\nactivity of the wedge thrusts during this time span. Accordingly, the same authors argue \n\nthat the Present day internal deformation is more likely to be accommodated by small \n\nincrements of local reactivation of inherited blind thrusts, being more homogeneously \n\ndistributed over the entire wedge rather than concentrated on newly formed major \n\nfrontal thrusts disrupting the seafloor. However, a detailed study of the Horseshoe \n\nValley region (see Fig. 4.2), presented in the next chapter (Duarte et al., 2010), suggests \n\nthat the accretionary is still propagating to the west. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 \u2013 Multi-channel seismic Delsis profile (A) and respective interpretation (B) across the GCAW \n\ndeformation front; see stratigraphic column C in Fig. 4.3 for correlation of the observed seismic units (see \n\nFig. 4.4 for location; Adapted from Duarte et al., submitted). \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n4.2. The SWIM fault system \n\n \n\nThe SWIM fault system is a group of WNW-ESE striking subvertical faults \n\nextending along 600 km from the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz to the southern limit \n\nof the Gorringe Bank (see Fig. 4.2). These tectonic features seemingly interfere with \n\nseveral different morphotectonic domains such as the GCAW, the Horseshoe Valley and \n\nthe Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (see Fig. 4.6). The morphologic expression of the SWIM \n\nfaults corresponds to a more or less continuous alignment of seafloor crests and troughs \n\nwith wavelengths of the order of tens of kilometers, sometimes exhibiting an en echelon \n\ngeometrical disposition (Fig. 4.6), and commonly punctuated by active mud volcanoes \n\nwithin the domain of the accretionary wedge (see Fig. 4.2) and possibly just outboard to \n\nthe west. The linear morphologic expression of the SWIM faults is more prominent both \n\nclose to the northern part of the accretionary wedge deformation front and in the \n\nHorseshoe Valley (Fig. 4.7 and 4.8), where the lineament corresponding to the \n\nmorphological expression of the SWIM 1 fault can be followed almost continuously for \n\nabout 200 kilometers and the width of the affected area is of a few hundred metres. In \n\nsome segments of this lineaments is possible to identify undulations, striking E-W, with \n\nmaximum lengths of about 8 km. These features also show an ?en echelon? pattern that \n\nwas interpreted to correspond to NE-SW oriented folds of the Recent sedimentary cover \n\n(see Fig. 4.8; Rosas et al., 2009, in appendix). Despite the fact that the lineaments can \n\nsometimes exhibit some continuity reaching more than 200 km, this does not mean that \n\nthe underlying faults are strictly continuous and connected. Quite on the contrary, the \n\nlineaments seem to be controlled by a discontinuous alignment of deep rooted faults \n\nprobably resulting from a complex tectonic evolution (see text below and Chapter 6 for \n\na more detailed discussion). Also note that in this work there are noteworthy \n\ndiscrepancies in the interpretations of these structures. This results from the fact that the \n\nearliest interpretations of the SWIM strike-slip faults were done using limited \n\nbathymetry datasets, which did not allow an accurate cartography and sometimes led to \n\nmisleading or alternative interpretations. With the increasing availability of new \n\nbathymetry data (and MCS profiles), the interpretations were progressively upgraded. In \n\naddition, other authors proposed different interpretations for the SWIM fault system \n\n(e.g. Zitellini et al., 2009). The upgraded tectonic map presented in Fig. 4.2 intends to \n\ninclude the more recent interpretation of these features, though with some degree of \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nsimplification due to the scale adopted. The different sections of this manuscript and \n\nassociated papers may present alternative or simplified interpretations of these same \n\n(SWIM) features. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Shaded relief image of the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and continental rise to the NE; view \n\nfrom SW, showing the morphological expression of the SWIM faults 1 and 2, indicated by grey arrows. \n\nThe small black arrows show seafloor deformation probably corresponding to NE-SW oriented ?en \n\nechelon? folds.

The seismic data showed that the \n\nlineaments correspond to the morphological expression of more or less aligned arrays of \n\ndeep-rooted faults, often breaching out through Present day seafloor sediments (Fig. 4.9; \n\nRosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte et al., submitted; Rosas et al, \n\nsubmitted).  \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 (A and B) Different views of the L1 and SWIM 1 lineaments and associated morphologic \n\nfeatures.

Rosas \n\net al. (submitted) presented an alternative interpretation for the structure corresponding to the SWIM 2, \n\naccording to these authors it may correspond to a corner thrust formed as the result of the interference \n\nbetween the Horseshoe fault and the SWIM 1 fault (note in Fig. 4.7 that the two structures seem to merge \n\nin this area).

(1997) \n\nand Roque (2007).  \n\n \n\nFrom the inspection of the IAM 3 and 4 seismic profiles in Fig. 4.9 it is evident \n\nthat the SWIM faults are aligned along basement normal faults controlling the geometry \n\nof the Mesozoic sediments. These faults are interpreted as being formed during the \n\nMesozoic rifting events. This interpretation is supported by the presence of a growth \n\nwedge contemporaneous of a normal movement (Fig. 4.10 - Unit B). In this figure it \n\nalso possible to observe that the SWIM 2 structure was reactivated, after the extensional \n\nevent, with southwards reverse movement given that the growth wedge is over-thrust \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\ntowards the southwest. The thrusting seems to be contemporaneous of the emplacement \n\nof the accretionary wedge (Unit D and D\u2018) since this clearly tapers towards the \n\nnortheast. From the inspection of the seismic profiles it is possible to observe that the \n\nSWIM 2 fault deforms the Pliocene-Quaternary units, breaching through the seafloor. It \n\nis also noticeable that the more recent cover sediments are strongly deformed mostly to \n\nthe south of the SWIM 2 (see Unit E in Fig. 4.10), suggesting that this sub-vertical fault \n\ncorresponds to the present deformation limit of the accretionary wedge in this area. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Multi-channel seismic reflection profile IAM GC2 (see Fig. 4.7 for location). The white \n\ndashed line mark the SWIM 2 fault zone. The profile shows two previous movements along this structure \n\n(normal and reverse, white open and closed arrows, respectively).  A - Basement; B - Growing wedge \n\n(Mesozoic age); C - Post-rift unit (Meso-Cenozoic age); D and D\u2018 - Accretionary Wedge unit (Miocene \n\nage to Pliocene-Quaternary); E - Cover unit (Pliocene-Quaternary age). D\u2018 corresponds to the unit \n\nemplaced during late Miocene, while the deposition of unit D continued to more recent times (Adapted \n\nfrom Duarte et al., 2009, in appendix).  \n\n \n\nRosas et al. (2009; in appendix), based on the age of the sedimentary units and in \n\nthe en echelon folding geometry (see Fig. 4.8), estimated that the SWIM faults dextral \n\nstrike-slip reactivation in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and Horseshoe Valley may had \n\ninitiated at ca. 1.8 Ma ago. This is in agreement with the recent kinematic models \n\nderived from geodetic observations, indicating that the ca. 4 mm/yr Present day \n\nconvergence between Nubia and Iberia is subparallel to these faults. In fact the present \n\nconvergence direction is the most reliable (indirect) observation supporting the \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\ninterpretation of the SWIM faults as dextral strike-slip faults. Although, dextral offsets \n\nof other structures along the SWIM faults are sparse. For instance, the Horseshoe Fault \n\nhas two segments that seem to be offset by one structure with the same direction of the \n\nSWIM faults (see Fig. 4.2 and 4.11). However, both the SWIM faults and the Horseshoe \n\nfault are presently active and thus complex thrust-wrench interference patterns are \n\nexpected to occur, which appear to be the case in this region, as reported by Rosas et al. \n\n(submitted, in appendix). Also, in the region of the Coral Patch Thrust Front (see Fig. \n\n4.2 and 4.11) some of the active thrusts appear to be delimited and displaced along the \n\nSWIM faults. However, this displacement is most probably false, since it completely \n\nvanishes onto the Coral Patch Ridge. Here, the thrusts are most likely using the SWIM \n\nanisotropies as lateral ramps, since they clearly bound major thrusts without an obvious \n\noffset. Another important observation is that the SWIM faults do not displace the front \n\nof the accretionary wedge (see Fig. 4.11), which should be expected if the front of the \n\nwedge was nearly inactive since the Miocene as suggested by Zitellini et al. (2009). \n\nThis is a major paradox in this area and will be investigated in detail in Chapter 6 \n\n(Duarte et al., submitted). \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.11 \u2013 Detailed bathymetry and structural setting of the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (HAP) region. \n\nNote the possible dextral offsets of thrusted structures and morphologies along the SWIM faults \n\n(interrogation points).

The NE-SW thrusts \n\n \n\nThe approximately NE-SW striking thrust system comprises the Horseshoe fault, \n\nthe Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault, the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault and the Gorringe northern \n\nthrust (Fig. 4.12; see e.g. Zitellini et al., 1999; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al., \n\n2003; Rovere et al., 2004; Zitellini et al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009; Cunha et al., \n\n2010). This system extends for approximately 300 km from near the contact with the \n\nCoral Patch Ridge (35.5\u00baN), towards the north, along the West Portuguese Margin until \n\na latitude of ~38\u00baN. These compressive structures correspond in general to deep rooted \n\nbasement faults with prominent escarpments, possible cutting the lithosphere at \n\ndifferent levels, as attested by seismic imagery and deep instrumental seismicity (see \n\ne.g. Fig. 1.4A; Stich et al., 2007; Terrinha et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2010; Silva et al., \n\n2010). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 \u2013 Detailed bathymetry and structural setting of the NE-SW thrusts area (marked in yellow). \n\nSeismic profiles tracks are shown in purple (see below). GB - Gorringe Bank; GCAW - Gulf of Cadiz \n\nAccretionary Wedge; HAP - Horseshoe Abyssal Plain; HV - Horseshoe Valley.  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n4.3.1. The Horseshoe Fault \n\n \n\nThe Horseshoe fault extends for about 100 km, bounding to the East the \n\nHorseshoe Abyssal Plain (see Fig. 4.12). The fault scarp is only well developed on its \n\nnothern segment, where it reaches a height of about 1000 meters. The southern segment \n\nof the Horseshoe scarp is being eroded by the South Portuguese canyons drainage \n\nsystem and widsepred mass transport processes (Terrinha et al., 2009, in appendix; \n\nDuarte et al., 2010, next chapter). Close to the intersection with the SWIM structures the \n\ntrace of the fault becomes less evident and appears to interfere with the SWIM faults \n\n(see also Figs. 4.6, 4.7 and 4.11 and Rosas et al., submitted, in appendix). To the south, \n\nthe Horseshoe fault probably connects with the Coral Patch thrusts. To the north, the \n\nfault split in several branches, where a couple of associated back-thrust are also \n\nrecognized. Here, the fault seems to terminate against a small WNW-ESE thrust. \n\nNevertheless, a relatively minor fault (the S. Vicente fault) can be traced northwards \n\nalong the S. Vicente canyon. The IAM-4e seismic profile (Fig. 4.13) crosscuts the \n\nHorseshoe fault around shot point 1000. The fault is clearly imaged as a SE dipping, \n\ndeep seated fault, rooting well into the basement (possible through Moho), prolonging \n\nupwards across the overlying units, and breaching out at the seafloor, where a resulting \n\nprominent deformation is marked by an offset of ca. ~0.6s TWT. The NW directed \n\nthrusting kinematics is clearly shown by the geometry of the folds affecting the \n\nMesozoic, and by the unambiguous offset of the surface marking the top of the \n\nMesozoic unit (see Fig. 4.13). To the SE of the Horseshoe fault, other relatively minor \n\nthrusts affecting the basal Mesozoic unit were previously described (e.g. Terrinha et al., \n\n2009, in appendix; Duarte et al., 2010, next chapter), although these only affect the base \n\nof the overlying chaotic body, lacking any kind of bathymetric expression (see Fig. \n\n4.13).  The same authors also report some degree of tectonic imbrication within the \n\nMiocene chaotic body further to SE, perturbing the seafloor morphology and controlling \n\nthe formation of a group of ?crescentic? depressions (see Duarte et al., 2010 - Chapter 5 \n\nfor a detailed discussion on the origin of these features). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13 \u2013 (A) Seismic section of the profile IAM-4e intercepting the Horseshoe thrust fault (see Fig. \n\n4.12 for location) and the Horseshoe Valley, where a group of crescentic depressions can be observed \n\n(see Duarte et al., 2010 - Chapter 5 for a detailed discussion on the origin of these features); (B) Tectonic \n\ninterpretation (seismo-stratigraphy approximately corresponding to the column B in Fig. 4.3).

Note that crescentic depressions 2 and 4 are located on top of blind thrusts \n\nrooted in the sole of the chaotic body, probably at the same structural level as the accretionary wedge \n\nd\u00e9collement.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n4.3.2. The Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault \n\n \n\n The Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault strikes close to N-S, parallel to the Portuguese \n\ncoast line, extending for about 60 km (see Fig. 4.12). It has a prominent scarp reaching a \n\nmaximum height of about 1800 meters, limiting a submarine plateau. The BS-22 \n\nseismic section (Fig. 4.14) shows that the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault also roots deep in \n\nthe basement, probably throughout the Moho. It is also possible to observe that the fault \n\nbreaches out at the seafloor, offsetting the entire sedimentary cover by ~1.5 seconds. \n\nThe NW directed thrusting kinematics is clearly shown by the geometry of the folds \n\naffecting the Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary sequence (see Fig. 4.14).  \n\nTo the south of the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal structure two blind northwest-directed \n\nthrusts were also identified (see Fig. 4.12), presenting an en echelon disposition in \n\nrelation both to the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal and Horseshoe faults. It is not clear if all these \n\nfaults are connected in depth to a common d\u00e9collement level or if they are linked by \n\nlateral ramps, and thus forming a single complex structure. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14 \u2013 Seismic section of the profile BS-22 intercepting the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal thrust fault (see \n\nFig. 4.12 for location). Seismo-stratigraphy approximately corresponding to column A in Fig. 4.3. Note \n\nthat the sequence of Meso-Cenozoic sediments is overlaying a thinned crustal continental basement \n\n(Cunha et al., 2010).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n4.3.3. The Tagus Abyssal Plain Fault \n\n \n\nThe Tagus Abyssal Plain fault extends for about 70 km with a prominent but \n\nrather irregular scarp (see Fig. 4.12), reaching a maximum height of about 1500 meters. \n\nThe scarp is steeper close to its southern tip and smoothing progressively towards the \n\nnorth, where manifestations of mass transport processes are observed. The BS-11 \n\nseismic section (Fig. 4.15) shows that the fault zone corresponds to a basement rooted \n\neast deeping thrust, offsetting the seafloor and the cover units by ca. 1 second. In the \n\nimaged segment of the profile, associated with the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault, it is also \n\npossible to observe two west dipping back-thrusts limiting a slightly asymmetric \n\nanticline. Toward the southern part of the profile minor anticlines controlled by faults \n\naffecting the Meso-Cenozoic units are also observed. Among the four reported NE-SW \n\nthrust structures, the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault is the one with less instrumental \n\nseismicity (see Fig. 1.4 and Fig 4.17 below). Also, the inspection of available seismic \n\nprofile shows recent sediments (darker top reflectors in Fig. 4.15) onlapping the fault \n\nscarp, which suggests that the peak activity of this segment of the Tagus Abyssal Plain \n\nFault was in the Upper Pliocene. Present day deformation seems to be preferentially \n\naccommodated in the back-thrusts that cut through the seafloor \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 \u2013 Seismic section of the profile BS-11 intercepting the Tagus Abyssal Plain thrust fault (see \n\nFig. 4.12 for location). Seismo-stratigraphy approximately corresponding to column A in Fig. 4.3. \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n4.3.4. The Gorringe Northern Thrust \n\n \n\nThe Gorringe Bank is the most impressive feature present in the SW Portuguese \n\nMargin (see Fig. 4.12), believed to be constituted by exhumed highly serpentinized \n\nmantle peridotites (Girardeau et al., 1998). The northern flank of the Gorringe Bank is \n\nlimited by a major thrust (the Gorringe northern thrust), that extends for about 130 km, \n\nupthrusting the seafloor from ?5000 m to ?24 m. The fault scarp is highly sharp and \n\nsteep (~10\u00ba). A major mass transport scar and correspondent deposit is observed in the \n\nnorthern segment of the fault attesting for its recent activity. The IAM-4 seismic section \n\n(Fig. 4.16) shows that the Gorringe northern thrust bounds a short flank of a major \n\nnorthwest vergent asymmetric anticline, comprising the entire Gorringe Bank structure. \n\nThis fault probably roots very deep in the basement since it offsets the seafloor in about \n\n6 seconds, in an area of oceanic domain. Despite the general westward vergence of the \n\nGorringe, some eastwards vergent back-thrust-related folds can be detected, particularly \n\nin the base of its southern flank. In the northern segment of the profile a wedge of an \n\nacoustic chaotic unit is clearly observed, progressively thickening towards the north \n\nflank of the Gorringe Bank. This wedge corresponds to a gravity unit believed to have \n\nformed in a period of paroxysmal tectonic activity during the late Oligocene-Miocene \n\nage (Sartori et al., 1994; Tortella et al., 1997; Terrinha et al., 2009; Jimenez-Munt et al., \n\n2010). Since then, the Gorringe has undergone a minimum shortening of 20 to 50 km \n\n(Hayward et al., 1999; Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010). The present activity of the Gorringe \n\nNorthern Thrust is attested by a cluster of instrumental seismicity (see Fig. 4.17). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.16 \u2013 Seismic section of the profile IAM-4 intercepting the Gorringe Bank and the Gorringe \n\nNorthern thrust (see Fig. 4.12 for location).

This \n\npossibility is congruent with the conspicuous presence of WNW-ESE morphological \n\nscarps in this area (noticeably the same direction of the SWIM faults), suggesting that \n\nsuch lateral ramps exist, connecting the NE-SW thrusts. Also, a cluster of instrumental \n\nseismicity between the Horseshoe and the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal faults and a few events \n\nbetween the north tips of the Horseshoe fault and the Gorringe northern thrust suggests \n\nthe existence of such structures (see Figs. 4.17; see also Fig. 2.7). These lateral ramps \n\nmay be accommodating the strike-slip component of WNW-ESE convergence between \n\nNubia and Iberia in a scenario of strain partition as suggested by Terrinha et al. (2009, \n\nin appendix).  If this is the case, it bears major implications for the seismogenic \n\npotential of this area, and for the understanding of the margin reactivation process. \n\nAccordingly, further work needs to be made to test this hypothesis. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 \u2013 Re-interpretation of the area shown in Fig. 4.12 showing the hypothetical structures (lateral \n\nramps - dashed red lines) connecting the NE-SW thrust system.  \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n4.4. Other important tectonic structures \n\n \n\n Besides the three previously described groups of structures, which included the \n\nGulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge, the SWIM faults system and the SW Iberia NE-SW \n\nthrusts, other important structures were also recognized in study area, such as the ENE-\n\nWSW to E-W striking system of thrusts and the NE-SW striking Cadiz fault (see Fig. \n\n4.2). The Seine thrusts and the Coral Patch thrust front that are predominantly \n\nnorthwestwards directed thrusts show a larger variation in fault strikes with respect to \n\nthe ones located further north. These thrusts may also have a different geological \n\nhistory, related to the evolution of the Moroccan margin, which was not studied in \n\ndetailed in this work. Nevertheless, they will be described below with some detail since \n\nthey may be important for the understanding of the overall picture of the Gulf of Cadiz \n\ngeotectonic evolution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.1. The ENE-WSW to E-W thrust system \n\n \n\n The ENE-WSW to E-W striking thrust system comprise the Coral Patch thrust \n\nfront, the Seine thrusts and the Portim\u00e3o pop-up (see Fig. 4.2; and also Figs. 4.17 and \n\n4.22 below). The Coral Patch thrust front and the Seine thrusts are a system of faults \n\nstriking approximately ENE-WSW located off to the west of SW part of Gulf of Cadiz \n\nregion (Fig. 4.19), extending from the southern Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (~36\u00baN) to the \n\ninner part of the Seine Abyssal Plain (~34\u00baN). This fault system consists of scattered to \n\nmore or less continuous sub-parallel thrusts, often exhibiting a few hundred meters high \n\nlinear scarps, with the exception of the Coral Patch Ridge and the Coral Patch Seamount \n\nthat rise 1000 and 3500 meters, respectively, above the surrounding seafloor. The Coral \n\nPatch thrust front is interpreted as a low angle thrust that carries the Seine Abyssal Plain \n\nover the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (Figs 4.20 and 4.21). The NE-SW striking Seine \n\nthrusts are isolated in the middle of the Seine Abyssal Plain with hanging-wall \n\nanticlines that correspond to linear hills with a maximum elevation of 800 meters above \n\nthe seafloor. From the inspection of the seismic section shown in Figure 4.21 it is \n\npossible to observe that the Coral Patch thrust front and the Seine thrust form an active \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nthick-skinned North-vergent fold-and-thrust belt, offsetting the sedimentary cover \n\naround 1 second. The major thrusts root deep in the basement (at around 11 seconds), \n\npossible at the base of the oceanic crust, (or even deeper in the mantle). In addition, the \n\npresence of a blind thrust in the southern part of the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (see Fig. \n\n4.19, detected in the northern segment of the MCS profile (see Fig.4.21), strongly \n\nsuggests that these thrusts are propagating northwards, to an area where major \n\ninstrumental earthquakes occur (see Figs. 1.4 and 4.17). This thrust system is likely to \n\nhave originated as result of the Africa-Iberia convergence that started in the Upper \n\nCretaceous. Despite de fact that some of these structures seem to be active, their activity \n\nhas probably diminished since the Miocene as the result of the change to a more oblique \n\nconvergence direction (WNW-ESE), as attested by the almost lack of seismicity on \n\nmost of the thrusts (see Figs. 1.4 and 4.17). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.19 \u2013 Detailed bathymetry and structure of the Coral Patch thrust front and Seine thrusts region \n\n(see Fig. 4.2). The AR-7 seismic profile track and bathymentric profile are coincident and shown in \n\npurple (see Figs. 4.22 and 4.21, respectively).  \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20 \u2013 Perspective view from WSW of the area shown in Fig. 4.19 and a bathymetric profile along \n\nthe seismic line track. Note the relative elevation of the Seine Abyssal Plain in relation to the Horseshoe \n\nAbyssal Plain. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.21 \u2013 Seismic section of the profile AR-7 intercepting the Coral Patch thrust front and the Seine \n\nthrusts (see Fig. 4.19 for location). Seismo-stratigraphy approximately corresponding to column A in Fig. \n\n4.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nThe Portim\u00e3o pop-up structure comprises two E-W antithetic thrusts bounding \n\nthe Portim\u00e3o Bank morphological high (Fig. 4.22). The E-W scarps are more prominent \n\nin the eastern part of the bank, where widespread landslide scars are observed, attesting \n\nfor the activity of this structure (see Terrinha et al., 2009, in appendix). To the East the \n\nPortim\u00e3o Bank is connected to the shelf by a relatively gentle slope. The southern thrust \n\nprobably extends further east connecting with another thrust sub-parallel to the Cadiz \n\nfault (see Fig. 4.22 and text below). From the inspection of the seismic section \n\npresented in Fig. 4.23 it is possible to observe that the Portim\u00e3o pop-up forms a slightly \n\nnorth-vergent anticline bounded by two thrusts that breach out through the seafloor, \n\noffsetting the cover sediments in more than 1 second. The southern thrust appears to \n\nhave a wrenching component as attested by the presence of other minor faults, defining \n\na flower-like structure (see Fig. 4.23). The Portim\u00e3o pop-up also seems to have formed \n\nduring the early Cenozoic in a phase of more North-directed convergence (see Terrinha \n\net al., 2009, in appendix). Presently, this structure is probably accommodating some of \n\nthe shortening component associated to the more oblique Nubia-Iberia convergence. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.22 \u2013 Detailed bathymetry and structure of the Portim\u00e3o pop-up and Cadiz fault region (see Fig. \n\n4.2).

Black \n\ndots stand for mud volcanoes. \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.23 \u2013 Seismic section of the profile VOL-3 intercepting the Portim\u00e3o pop-up structure (see Fig. \n\n4.22 for location).

The Cadiz Fault \n\n \n\nThe Cadiz fault strikes approximately NE-SW and extends for about 200 km \n\nfrom the northeastern Gulf of Cadiz continental shelf to the inner part of the \n\naccretionary wedge (Fig. 4.22: see also Figs. 4.2 and 4.4). The fault probably extends \n\ntowards the NE into the Guadalquivir river basin, in the Betics foreland. The fault is \n\nslightly curved towards the west in its southern segment where it intersects the SWIM 2 \n\nfault (see Fig. 4.22). Its seafloor morphology is complex (Fig. 4.24), defined by a \n\nrelatively diffuse broad area with widths varying from several hundreds of meters to a \n\nfew kilometers, materialized on the seafloor by the alignment of several different \n\nfeatures such as crests, scarps, channels and diapiric ridges (see Figs. 4.22 and 4.24). \n\nThe Cadiz fault morphological expression is more prominent in its northeastern segment \n\nand loses most of its expression progressively towards the South, vanishing in the \n\nsurroundings of the SWIM 2 (see Figs. 4.2 and 4.22). However, several mud volcanoes \n\nare traceable southwards along the direction of the Cadiz fault suggesting that it may \n\nextend further south. The seismic section crossing the Cadiz fault (Fig. 4.25) shows that \n\nit is sub-parallel to a basement southeastwards-directed blind thrust, probably \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\ncontemporaneous of the Late Mesozoic - Early Cenozoic N-S convergence. The thrust \n\nmovement is supported by the gentle folding of the reflectors of the basement. In the \n\nseismic profile is also possible to observe a thin-skinned fault accommodating the over-\n\nthrusting of the accretionary wedge Miocene deformation front towards NE, over the \n\nbasement. Near the surface the more continuous Pliocene-Quaternary cover sediments \n\nare clearly folded; though, they do not show evidences of major vertical faulting and \n\ndisplacement, attesting for wrenching movement of the Cadiz fault, discussed in Duarte \n\net al. (2009, in appendix). No kinematic indicators could clearly be detected, probably \n\ndue to the high rate of recent sedimentation associated with the proximal parts of the \n\nMediterranean Outflow Water and as well as to the extrusion of fluidized material along \n\nmud volcanoes. The same authors, based on data published by Stich et al. (2006), which \n\nreported a 3.5 mm.a-1 of westward motion of the Gibraltar arc relative to intra-plate \n\nIberia, proposed that the Cadiz lineament is a major dextral strike-slip fault zone \n\naccommodating the westward expulsion of the Gibraltar Arc relative to Iberia (see Fig. \n\n4.2). Also, a NE-SW elongated cluster of low to intermediate seismicity exists in this \n\narea attesting for the activity of this structure (see Fig. 4.17; and also Fig. 1.4). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24 \u2013 Perspective view form NE of the Gulf of Cadiz.

Duarte, P. Terrinha, F.M. Rosas, V. Valadares, L.M. Pinheiro, L. Matias, V. \n\nMagalh\u00e3es, C. Roque. \n\n \n\n(This chapter is presented in a paper format, as published in Marine Geology; \n\nDuarte et al., 2010). \n\n \n\nThe subject of this chapter is a group of intriguing kilometric crescent-shaped \n\ndepressions lying in the Horseshoe Valley, between the GCAW and Horseshoe fault \n\n(see area in Fig. 4.2). A detailed morphotectonic analysis of the Horseshoe Valley \n\ncontributed for the unraveling of the processes that originated these crescentic \n\ndepressions. The present work showed that these features formed as the result of the \n\ninteraction between downslope currents and tectonically-originated slope breaks. The \n\ncrescentic depressions are controlled by active (blind) thrust faults that root at the \n\nGCAW d\u00e9collement layer, to the west of the GCAW deformation front. Therefore, the \n\ncrescentic depressions seem to correspond to the morphological expression of the \n\nwestward propagation of the deformation from the realm of the accretionary wedge \n\n(GCAW), into the Horseshoe Valley domain. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nMultibeam swath bathymetry data from the Northwestern part of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz revealed the existence of several intriguing kilometric crescentic depressions \n\nlying between -4300 m and -4700 m, never before reported to occur at such great \n\ndepths. Morphological parameterization of these features, coupled with detailed analysis \n\nof multi-channel and middle resolution seismic profiles, showed that these crescent-\n\nshaped features were formed due to the existence of specific time-recurrent interaction \n\nbetween: a) regional active thrusts, which portray the overall tectonic scenario in the \n\narea, and on top of which most crescentic depressions are carved; and b)  tectonically \n\ninduced scouring comprising localized erosion and simultaneous progradational \n\nsedimentation, produced by downslope currents of probable turbiditic origin. The \n\nobtained results also suggest a possible contribution of fluid migration and extrusion \n\nprocesses, such as mud volcanism and associated pockmark formation, besides gravity \n\ndriven landslides and slumping, in the development of the studied crescentic \n\ndepressions. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Gulf of Cadiz morphotectonics; deep sea crescent-shaped features; deep-\n\nwater sedimentary processes; deep sea scouring. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n5.1. Introduction \n\n \n\n5.1.1. Previous work \n\n \n\nCrescent-shaped morphologies in association with escarpments are common in \n\nsubmarine and sub-aerial slope surfaces (e.g. sand dunes). They are frequently \n\nassociated with gravitational mass transport (e.g. landslides and slumps), fluid escape \n\nand erosive processes. Landslides are typically bounded by arcuate, concave-downhill \n\nhead scarps and concave uphill toes (Locat and Lee, 2000; McAdoo et al., 2000; Wilson \n\net al., 2004; Martel, 2004). Features caused by collapse processes associated with fluid \n\nescape and mud volcanism can also exhibit crescent-shaped morphologies (Dimitrov \n\nand Woodside, 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Le\u00f3n et al., 2006), as in the case of \n\nasymmetrical pockmarks when occurring on slopes (Hovland and Judd, 1988). \n\nSubmarine crescent-shaped morphologies related to erosional processes, such as \n\nscouring, are also documented in various geological settings, and usually associated \n\nwith turbidity, downslope and bottom currents: Faug\u00e8res et al. (1997) reported the \n\nexistence of erosion scours in the termination of the Barbados Prism, at depths of about \n\n3000 m; Bulat and Long (2001) described a group of crescent-shaped scours in the \n\nFaroe-Shetland Channel with escarpments up to 200 m high, lying at depths of 200 m; \n\nBonnel et al. (2005) described features in the Gulf of Lions formed by erosion-\n\ndeposition processes associated with turbidity currents; Verdichio and Trincardi (2006) \n\nreported a set of crescent-shaped features at depths of about 600 m with escarpments up \n\nto 50 m in the Southwest Adriactic Margin, formed by bottom currents; Fildani et al. \n\n(2006) recognized a group of crescent-shaped giant scours with escarpments up to 100 \n\nm height at depths of about 3500 m near Monterey East Channel. \n\nIn the North-eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, sub-circular seafloor features \n\ninterpreted as asymmetrical pockmarks, slide scars and erosion scours, associated with \n\nmud volcanism, hydrocarbon seepage, mass wasting processes and bottom currents \n\nactivity have also been described (e.g. Somoza et al., 2003; L\u00e9on et al., 2006; \n\nHern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006; Mulder et al., 2006;  Hanquiez et al., 2007). However, \n\nunlike the ones discussed in this work, most of these features are located at relatively \n\nshallow depths, ranging from the outer continental shelf to the middle continental slope. \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nIn the present paper we report the existence of submarine kilometric crescentic \n\ndepressions at depths of more than 4000 m (between -4300 m and -4700 m). Based on \n\nrecently acquired multibeam swath bathymetry data (Zitellini et al., 2009; Terrinha et \n\nal., 2009), coupled with the analysis of available multi-channel seismics (MCS) and \n\nmiddle resolution seismic profiles, we supply a detailed morphological description of \n\nthese features, their internal sedimentary structure and their structural setting and \n\ndiscuss different processes that could have led to their formation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1.2. General tectonic setting and geomorphology \n\n \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located in the Atlantic Ocean offshore SW Iberia and NW \n\nMorocco (Fig. 5.1A and inset), comprising the easternmost segment of the Azores-\n\nGibraltar Fracture Zone, which is interpreted as the Atlantic Africa-Eurasia main plate \n\nboundary (e.g. Purdy, 1975; Zitellini et al., 2009). The most important tectonic features \n\npresently observed in the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 5.1B) result from the Early Cenozoic to \n\nLate Miocene Alpine orogenesis overprinted onto preexistent extensional basins of \n\nTriassic-Cretaceous age (Terrinha, 1998). This evolution is associated with the collision \n\nbetween Iberia and northwest Africa (Nubia) tectonic plates, which ultimately led to the \n\nformation of the Betic-Rif orogenic arc in Miocene times and the submarine \n\naccretionary wedge of the Gulf of Cadiz (e.g. Srivastava et al., 1990; Lonergan and \n\nWhite, 1997; Maldonado et al., 1999; Rosenbaum et al., 2002a,b, Gutscher et al., 2002; \n\nIribarren et al., 2007).  Late Miocene to present tectonics is mainly determined by: a) \n\noblique convergence between Nubia and Eurasia (Iberia) plates (Calais et al., 2003); and \n\nb) Eastward dipping subduction of an oceanic slab with development of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz accretionary prism (Gutscher et al., 2002).  \n\nThe overall morphological shaping of the Gulf of Cadiz results from the \n\ninteraction between regional active tectonics, sedimentation and erosional processes, \n\nfluid migration and escape and oceanographic dynamics (Gutscher et al., 2002; \n\nGutscher et al., 2009; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et \n\nal., 2006; Terrinha et al., 2009). The form and geographic location of this region, \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\nenclosing in its easternmost domain the gateway to the Mediterranean Sea across the \n\nStraits of Gibraltar (Fig. 5.1), locally determines the behaviour of various major water \n\nmasses, such as the North Atlantic Deep Water and particularly the Mediterranean \n\nOutflow Water - MOW (e.g. Ambar and Howe, 1979a,b; Llave et al., 2001; Johnson et \n\nal., 2002; Llave et al., 2006; Mulder et al., 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006, 2008). \n\nA more detailed characterization of the Gulf of Cadiz allowed the recognition of the \n\nseveral main geomorphologic features depicted in Fig. 5.1A. The kilometric crescentic \n\ndepressions targeted in this work are located in the so called Horseshoe Valley, offshore \n\nthe SW Iberian margin (see Fig. 5.1A, 5.2, 5.3). This area displays a network of well \n\ndeveloped submarine, canyons, gulleys and wide valleys, which are related to the \n\nchannelling of downslope and turbidity currents, driving the sediments from the \n\ncontinental shelf and slope to the abyssal plain (Fig. 5.2B). Here, the impact of \n\ndownslope processes on the shaping of the seafloor is clearly dominant. Moreover, this \n\narea is subjected to tectonic uplift (Terrinha et al., 2003, Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003), related to \n\ngeneral north-westward thrusting in the Gulf of Cadiz, which favours erosion by valley \n\ninception as a response to higher slope and more abrupt morphology building (Zitellini \n\net al., 2004, Terrinha et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 (next page) \u2013 (A) Gulf of Cadiz main geomorphologic features.

Methodology and data \n\n \n\nThe discovery of the seafloor crescentic depressions described in this paper \n\nresulted from the analysis of two main sets of data: multibeam swath bathymetry and \n\nseismic reflection. The bathymetry data were used to characterize the geomorphology of \n\nthe area where the crescentic depressions are situated and also to accomplish a detailed \n\nmorphological parameterization of these features. The seismic reflection dataset \n\ncomprises multi-channel and middle resolution seismics. The multi-channel seismics \n\nwere used to unravel the general deep structure of the area where the crescentic \n\ndepressions are located, whereas the analysis of higher resolution profiles aimed at a \n\ndetailed characterization of the shallow structure and sedimentary architecture of these \n\nfeatures.  \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Multibeam swath bathymetry data \n\n \n\nThe multibeam swath bathymetry dataset was acquired during the MATESPRO \n\n(Major TEctonic and Sedimentary PROcesses in the Portuguese Margins \u2013 see Figs. 5.2, \n\n5.4) cruise, onboard the Portuguese vessel NRP D. Carlos I in June/July 2004 (Terrinha \n\net al., 2009). The cruise covered a total area of approximately 38 000 km\n2\n in the \n\nnorthwestern part of the Gulf of Cadiz region. The bathymetric data were acquired using \n\na hull-mounted Simrad EM120 multibeam echosounder, fulfilling the rules established \n\nby the International Hydrographic Organization for an order 3 hydrographic survey (see \n\nTerrinha et al., 2009). Interpretation was made using terrain analysis techniques and \n\nimage analysis of the bathymetry using commercial software, ArcGIS and Fledermaus. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Seismic reflection data \n\n \n\nMulti-channel seismic profiles of the Iberian Atlantic Margin campaign (Banda \n\net al., 1995; Tortella et al., 1997) were used for the inspection of the deep structure. \n\nTwo single-channel seismic profiles were acquired (PSAT-244 and 246) during the 14\nth\n\n \n\nTraining-Through-Research cruise of UNESCO \u2013IOC, Leg 1, onboard of the Russian \n\nvessel RV Professor Logachev in July/August 2004 (Fig. 5.3; Kenyon et al., 2006), in \n\nthe scope of the MVSEIS Euromargins Project. The MCS has a vertical resolution \n\nbetween 20 and 50 m and the single channel have a vertical resolution of about 2 to 5 m. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3. Morphotectonic characterization of the \n\ncrescentic depressions \n\n \n\n5.3.1. Morphotectonic setting: the Horseshoe Valley \n\n  \n\nThe Horseshoe Valley, together with the S. Vincent canyon, is one of the two \n\ncollectors of the shelf and slope erosive system of southwest Iberia that converge into \n\nthe Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. The studied crescentic depressions are located in the \n\nHorseshoe Valley (HV) (Figs. 5.2, 5.3) that collects the Aljezur, Portim\u00e3o, Lagos and \n\nFaro Canyons, the Portim\u00e3o and the Cadiz Valley. The HV has a trapezoidal shape with \n\ndepths varying between -4200 m to -4800 m and a mean slope of 0.5\u00ba to the west.  \n\nThe HV is delimited by the Sagres Plateau in the North, by the Coral Patch \n\nRidge in the South, and by the deformation front of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary \n\nwedge in the East (Figs. 5.2A, C, 5.3). To the West, the HV is bounded by the NE-SW \n\ntrending Horseshoe Fault, which corresponds to a westward directed active thrust \n\n(Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003, Zitellini et al., 2004), whose morphologic expression is marked by \n\na hundred meter high scarp separating this domain from the westward adjacent \n\nHorseshoe Abyssal Plain (see Figs. 5.1B, 5.2C). The drainage system finds its way \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nacross the Horseshoe Fault scarp along narrows gullies that are the loci of retreating \n\nerosion showing evidences of landslide occurrence (Fig. 5.2). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 \u2013 (A) Bathymetry and slope map of the Horseshoe Valley. Location of the seismic profiles \n\nIAM-4e, PSAT-244 and PSAT-246; White arrows refer to the location of undulated seafloor features, e.g. \n\nslumps and landslides. (B) Line drawing depicting the interpretation of the main morphotectonic features \n\nobserved and the numbering of the study crescentic depressions. \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\nThe flat area of the Horseshoe Valley is thus interpreted as being uplifted on the \n\nhanging wall of the deep seated Horseshoe Fault (e.g. Tortella et al., 1997; Zitellini et \n\nal., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009). This area is also affected by several major WNW-ESE \n\ntrending lineaments, the SWIM lineaments (Figs. 5.1B, 5.3B), which were recently \n\ninterpreted as aligned arrays of also deep seated, sub-vertical, dextral strike-slip faults \n\n(Terrinha et al., 2009; Rosas et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). The transitional area \n\nfrom the Sagres Valley to the Horseshoe Valley displays an undulated seafloor surface \n\ncomprising waves varying from hundreds of meters to more than 10 km in length, and \n\nup to 5 km across (white arrows in Fig. 5.3). These features are generally straight to \n\nslightly sinuous, and their undulated surfaces have also been previously interpreted as \n\nthe bathymetric expression of mass transport processes and soft sediment deformation, \n\nincluding gravity driven folds, small scale slumps and turbiditic erosional/deposition \n\nfeatures (Terrinha et al., 2009).  \n\nDespite the shallow dip of the Horseshoe Valley, a thorough analysis of its \n\nbathymetry allowed the identification of slope breaks, separating a staircase-like series \n\nof flats, descending in the direction of the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain (Fig. 5.3). Some of \n\nthese scarps correspond to NE-SW trending folds sitting on top of westwards directed \n\nblind thrusts as described elsewhere in this work. The crescentic depressions reported in \n\nthis work are located on these slope breaks (Figs. 5.3, 5.4).  \n\n \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 \u20133D imaging of the Horseshoe Valley domain comprising the study crescentic depressions \n\n(digital bathymetry model from MATESPRO dataset, vertical exaggeration factor of 8): (A) General view \n\nfrom West of crescentic depressions C2 to C8; (B) Depiction of slope value distribution in the study area \n\n(SW view); (C) Bathymetric profile X-Y intersecting two slope breaks corresponding to the depressions 3 \n\nand 4 (white arrows), illustrating the striking contrast between the smooth dip of the Horseshoe Valley \n\nseafloor and the abruptness of the crescentic escarpments; (D) Parallel bathymetric profile X\u2018-Y\u2018 that \n\ndoes not cut across the crescentic depressions, depicting the existence of smoother slope breaks in the \n\nHorseshoe Valley seafloor (yellow arrows). \n\n \n\n5.3.2. Geometry of the Horseshoe Valley crescentic depressions \n\n \n\nThe study objects of this work are the crescentic depressions that are located \n\nstrictly within the HV only. This is because, firstly, they bear no obvious association \n\nwith gravity or mass transport processes as others in the Gulf of Cadiz, like the ones \n\nlocated further north on the slope of the Sagres plateau (see Fig. 5.3), secondly, they \n\ncluster within the shallow dipping channel (HV mean dip is 0.5\u00ba and the maximum local \n\ndip is 3\u00ba) that collects the drainage system already mentioned, thirdly, they are located \n\nbetween two main tectonic structures, the Horseshoe Fault and the accretionary wedge \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\nand, fourthly, they are probably the deepest crescent shapes described in the scientific \n\nliterature, between -4300m and -4700m.  \n\nThe crescentic depressions exhibit a morphology consisting of downslope \n\nconcave crescent-shaped escarpments surrounding an internal depression with \n\nkilometric lengths (Figs. 5.4, 5.5A). Morphological parameters were used to describe \n\neight crescentic depressions in the HV, as depicted in Fig. 5.5B and in Table 5.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3.2.1. Height and slope of the crescentic depression scarps \n\n \n\nThe height and slope of the crescent-shaped escarpments can be seen as \n\nexpressing the degree of abruptness (or steepness) of these features. The measured data \n\n(Table 5.1) show a mean slope value of approximately 0.2 (~11\u00ba dip), with the \n\nexception of crescentic depression 5 in which the escarpment exhibits a higher slope of \n\n0.51 (~27\u00ba dip). The escarpment heights vary mostly between 80 m and 120 m, with the \n\nexceptions of depressions 1 and 2, which show heights of 50 m and 30 m respectively. \n\nBased on these data (slope and height) no consistent relationship can be drawn between \n\nthe variation of the abruptness of the individual crescentic depressions and their location \n\nin the HV.  In fact, the data shows that some constancy exists in the steepness of the \n\nescarpment crescents regardless of their different locations, shapes and sizes. The \n\nroughly linear relationship between height and width suggests that the steepness might \n\ndepend on material properties, such as cohesion or plastic yield point, for the cases of \n\nloose materials like sand or clays, respectively.  \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 \u2013 Morphological parameterization of the studied crescentic depressions.

Crescentic depression axial ratio - a \n\n \n\nThe internal depressions of the studied features exhibit widths and lengths \n\n(parameters CW and CL as defined in Figs. 5.5A \u2013 inset, and B)  that vary from 500 m \n\nto 2500 m, and between 750 and 5000 m, respectively (Table 5.1). The axial ratio of the \n\ncrescentic depressions is here defined as: \n\n \n\n  \n    \n\n  \n \n\n \n\nParameter a equals 1 when the general overall shape of the depression \n\napproximates a semi-circumference. If depressions show semi-elliptical shapes, a is \n\neither >1, when CL/2> CW as is generally the case, or a&lt;1, when CL/2<CW. \n\nSimilarly to what was referred above for height and slope, no coherent/linear \n\nrelationship exists between a and the individual location of the crescentic depressions in \n\nthe Horseshoe Valley. Moreover, it is also clear from the graphic in Fig. 5.5D that with \n\nthe exception of feature 2, all samples plot at values of a?1, meaning that crescentic \n\ndepressions tend to develop similar shapes in spite of their different locations. \n\nIn Fig. 5.5E, the relationship between the slope and the axial ratio is graphically \n\nillustrated. Because the slope values are constant (between ~0.1 and ~0.25, see Fig. \n\n5.5C), all samples but feature 5 cluster under constant slope of ~0.25 and it is clear that \n\nthe crescentic depressions cluster in three groups as a function of their different values \n\nof a. The first group (Group 1 in Fig. 5.5E) consists of feature 2 only, which exhibits a \n\nsingular low a value, implying an extreme concavity, and a highly elongated geometry \n\nparallel to the direction of its longest CW axis (see Figs. 5.3B, 5.4, 5.5A). Group 2 \n\nincludes 5 of the 8 crescentic depressions with a values comprised between 1.0 and 1.5 \n\n(mean a value of ~1.23). Finally, the third group comprises crescentic depressions 4 and \n\n7 with relatively high a values of 2.5, implying highly elongated semi-elliptical shapes. \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that with the exception of crescentic depressions 2 and 5, \n\nwhich show anomalous values of axial ratio and slope, all the crescentic escarpments \n\nare oriented parallel to the direction of the large scale slope breaks that disrupt the \n\nHorseshoe Valley seafloor (see Figs. 5.3, 5.4). \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Measured morphological parameters. \n\nCrescentic \n\nDepressions (see \n\nFig. 5.5) \n\nEscarpment \n\nHeight - EH \n\n(m) \n\nEscarpment \n\nWidth - EW \n\n(m) \n\nDip  \n\n(\u00ba) \n\nSlope Crescentic \n\nDepressions \n\nLength - CL \n\n(m) \n\nCL/2  \n\n(m) \n\nCrescentic \n\nDepressions \n\nWidth - CW \n\n(m) \n\nAxial ratio \n\na=(CL/2)/C\n\nW \n\n1 50 476 6 0.11 3000 1500 1200 1.25 \n\n2 30 285 6 0.11 750 375 1500 0.25 \n\n3 120 565 12 0.21 5000 2500 2500 1.00 \n\n4 100 631 9 0.16 3000 1500 600 2.50 \n\n5 80 157 27 0.51 1500 750 650 1.15 \n\n6 80 454 10 0.18 3000 1500 1000 1.50 \n\n7 80 454 10 0.18 2500 1250 500 2.50 \n\n8 100 514 11 0.19 4000 2000 1600 1.25 \n\nMean values 80 442 11.38 0.20 2843.75 1421.88 1193.75 1.43 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Sedimentary and tectonic structure of the crescentic \n\ndepressions \n\n \n\nThe description of the detailed structural architecture of the crescentic \n\ndepressions was based on the interpretation of multi-channel (IAM4e, Fig. 5.6) and \n\nmiddle resolution seismic profiles (PSAT246 and PSAT 244, Figs. 5.7, 5.8). \n\n \n\n5.3.3.1. Multi-channel seismic profile IAM4e \n\n \n\nThe IAM4e profile strikes NW-SE along the Horseshoe Valley intersecting \n\ncrescentic depressions 2 and 4 and passing close to number 3 (see Fig. 5.6; 5.3 for the \n\nlocation of the profile). It comprises the following seismostratigraphic units and sub-\n\nunits: \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\na) A basal unit (A) of coherent high amplitude, continuous and parallel \n\nreflections, with a thickness of about 2 s (twt), corresponding to Mesozoic through \n\nEocene rocks (Tortella et al., 1997). This unit is cut by several reverse faults that also \n\naffect the overlying units, but do not breach out at the seafloor surface. The exception to \n\nthis is the Horseshoe Fault, which cuts through all the cover units offsetting them by \n\napproximately 1 s (twt). \n\nb) Unit B is approximately ~1.5 s (twt) thick, has a semi-chaotic seismic \n\nsignature, characterized by high amplitude shallow dipping discontinuous seismic \n\nreflections with continuous eastwards dipping reflections. The latter can be \n\ncontinuously followed for more than 10km and have been interpreted by various authors \n\nas thrust imbricate of middle Miocene age, and olistostromes deposits (Torelli et al., \n\n1997; Tortella et al., 1997), that detach at the sole of Unit B (Fig. 5.6). Some of these \n\nthrusts were reactivated as blind thrusts in Pliocene-Quaternary times because they \n\ndeform the sediments of this age that are included in Unit C. The deformation caused by \n\nthe blind thrusts is accommodated by the top Unit C by folds that account for the \n\nstepped morphology of the HV. The majority of the crescentic depressions are located \n\nalong these folds, carved in their slope breaks that disrupt the Horseshoe Valley seafloor \n\n(see Fig. 5.3, 5.4, 5.6).  \n\nc) A top Unit C of ~ 0.5 s (twt) of thickness, generally characterized by very \n\nwell imaged parallel reflections, corresponding to a hemi-pelagic sedimentary cover that \n\naccordingly with Tortella et al. (1997) comprises two seismostratigraphic sub-units of \n\ndifferent age (SU1 and SU2 in Fig. 5.6): \n\n- A Late Miocene sub-unit (SU1) that exhibits a thickness varying between 0.1 s \n\nto 0.3 s (twt), consisting of high amplitude, high frequency, coherent reflections \n\nwith onlap and downlap terminations on top of a folded and faulted basal \n\ndiscontinuity, which separates SU1 from the underlying lower to middle \n\nMiocene unit; \n\n- A Pliocene-Quaternary sub-unit (SU2) with a fairly constant thickness of about \n\n0.2 s (twt), consisting of a sequence of high amplitude reflections, although less \n\ncoherent than those of SU1, showing a parallel to prograding geometry, with \n\ndownlap and onlap terminations. \n\n \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 \u2013 (A) Multi-channel seismic profile IAM-4e intersecting crescentic depressions 2 and 4 (see \n\nFig. 5.3 for location); (B) Correspondent seismostratigraphic and tectonic interpretation.

This dome is seemingly impinging the uppermost \n\ncover unit, reaching the seafloor surface and producing a bathymetric ellipsoidal ridge \n\nin the vicinity of crescentic depression 3, clearly seen in the bathymetry (see Figs. 5.3, \n\n5.4). This dome shows a WNW-ESE elongation and a maximum high of 100 m. \n\nCrescentic depressions 2 and 4 incise the subunit SU2 as imaged at shot points \n\n587 and 340 in the IAM4e profile (Fig. 5.6). These crescentic depressions are located on \n\ntop of hanging wall anticlines of upward propagating blind thrusts that are well \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\nrecognized in Unit B. Despite the low resolution of this multi-channel seismic reflection \n\nprofile it is clear that the escarpment of depression 4 corresponds to an erosional \n\nsurface, since it truncates the uppermost seismic horizons. An upward convex geometry \n\nof the internal part of the depression is also detectable at this resolution and is imaged at \n\na higher resolution in Fig. 5.7. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3.3.2. Middle resolution seismic profiles (PSAT-246 and PSAT-\n\n244) \n\n \n\nThe detailed structure of the crescentic depression could only be \n\ncomprehensively addressed through the examination of the higher resolution seismic \n\nprofiles PSAT-246 and PSAT-244 specifically acquired for this purpose. The \n\nattenuation of acoustic energy by the water column of 4 km and sediments did not allow \n\nimaging below stratigraphic Unit C, to a maximum of circa 0.5 s (twt). The base of Unit \n\nC was cross checked with IAM4e seismic profile. \n\nThe WNW-ESE oriented PSAT-246 profile cuts across crescentic depressions 3 \n\nand 7 (Fig. 5.7, 5.3 for location). In its eastern part, between the Accretionary Wedge \n\nDeformation Front (AWDF) and depression 7, the lower SU1 sub-unit shows a \n\nsuccession of coherent reflectors with parallel, gently folded configuration (Fig. 5.7). \n\nThe continuation of this unit to the West of depression 7 is not clear, and it was only \n\ninterpretatively assumed by correlation with the slightly oblique (NW-SE) IAM4e \n\nprofile (see Fig. 5.3). The sub-unit SU2 is recognizable along the whole of the WNW-\n\nESE profile length. Between the AWDF and crescentic depression 7, the reflectors in \n\nthis sub-unit also exhibit a slightly folded configuration, but this is attenuated towards \n\nthe surface, where the reflections are almost horizontal (Fig. 5.7). Close to crescentic \n\ndepressions 7 and 3, to the West of each of their escarpments, sub-unit SU2 consists of \n\nseveral individual uphill progradation bodies. This, together with the truncation of sub-\n\nunit SU2 horizons behind the crescent-shaped scarps suggests uphill progradation of the \n\nsedimentary infill simultaneous with escarpment retreat (Fig. 5.7B). In the internal part \n\nof depression 3 several progadation bodies are buried (SU2a, SU2b and SU2c - Fig. \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n5.7C), separated by planar discontinuities (d2, d3 and d4, respectively) matching erosive \n\ntruncations, against which the reflectors often exhibit onlap and downlap terminations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 \u2013 (A) PSAT-246 seismic profile, intersecting the Accretionary Wedge Deformation Front \n\n(AWDF), and crescentic depressions 3 and 7 (see Fig. 5.3 for location); (B) Simplified \n\nseismostratigraphic/structural interpretation.

It is also possible \n\nto observe the dome-like structure (shot points 1026 in PSAT-244 and 460 in IAM4e, \n\nFigs. 5.6, 5.8, respectively) underlain by a seismically transparent zone, the origin of \n\nwhich is unknown. Considering the widespread existence of mud volcanoes and salt \n\ndiapirs with morphological expression on the seafloor in the Gulf of Cadiz, it is \n\nhypothesized that this dome could correspond to a fluid escape structure as well. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.8 \u2013 (A) PSAT-244 seismic profile intersecting crescentic depression 3 (see Fig. 5.3 for \n\nlocation); (B) Simplified seismostratigraphic interpretation.

Discussion \n\n \n\nThe morphologic parameters of the studied crescentic depressions determined \n\nabove (section 5.3.2), specifically slope and axial ratio (a), show that both their general \n\nshape and the steepness of their escarpments are independent of their location along the \n\nwestwards smoothly dipping Horseshoe Valley, whose general morphology is most \n\nprobably essentially related with the collection and transport of sediments from the \n\nshallower northern and northeastern domains of the Gulf of Cadiz (continental shelf and \n\nslope, see Figs. 5.1A, 5.2B). This suggests a similar fundamental origin for these \n\nfeatures, associated with natural processes other than only, or predominantly, the \n\nvarying smooth slope of the Horseshoe Valley as a whole. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4.1. Active tectonics \n\n \n\nThe studied features consist of crescent-shaped erosional depressions carved in \n\nseafloor slope breaks (see Fig. 5.3, 5.4) that correspond to the morphologic expression \n\nof blind thrusts, as shown in Fig. 5.6. The interpretation of the middle resolution seismic \n\nprofiles (Fig. 5.7) also showed that the sedimentary units deposited within the crescentic \n\ndepressions, and the external ones eroded by the retreating scarp (SU2 in Fig. 5.7C), are \n\nof the same age at the considered timescale. This scenario is compellingly indicative of \n\nthe control exerted by present day active thrusting in the formation and localization of \n\nthe crescentic depressions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\n5.4.2. Hypothetic hydrodynamic models \n\n  \n\n In the present situation, hydrodynamic models can only be discussed \n\nhypothetically, given the fact that the detailed deep?water circulation in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz, and particular in the Horseshoe Valley, is still fundamentally unknown. The \n\nprogradational architecture of the sedimentary lobes (section 5.3.3.2) is indicative of \n\nupslope deposition towards the internal part of the crescentic depressions, coeval with \n\nupslope erosion of their scarps. This requires the existence of deep water currents, \n\nwhich would be responsible for simultaneous localized erosion and sedimentation. Such \n\nspecific dynamics of interaction between a flow current and a pre-existent morphology \n\nhas previously been described worldwide by several authors, although at shallower \n\ndepths (Stow et al., 2002a,b; Verdicchio and Trincardi, 2006; Bulat and Long, 2001; \n\nFildani et al., 2006; Normark et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4.2.1. Bottom currents  \n\n \n\nIn this case, the observed erosional scarps and upslope progradational bodies \n\ncould hypothetically be both generated by the lateral movement of a bottom current, \n\nsuch as the North Atlantic Deep Water, parallel to the tectonically originated slope \n\nbreaks. However, this interaction would preferably cause the formation of more linear \n\nerosive and depositional features, similarly to mounded, elongated and separated drifts \n\n(Faug\u00e8res et al., 1999; Rebesco and Stow, 2001; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2009), rather than \n\nconfined crescentic depressions. \n\nAlternatively, the crescentic depressions could also be generated by the action of \n\nvertical eddies associated to this same type of current, at least by two different \n\nmechanisms (e.g. Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2008): i) the influence of energetic Meddies \n\nin the base of the Mediterranean Outflow Water, which could propagate to the seafloor; \n\nand ii) due to the local interaction of different water masses with similar densities. \n\nAccordingly, vertical eddy movement could generate erosional/depositional seafloor \n\nfeatures, characterized by less linear, i.e. more equidimensional, morphologies \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\n(Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2008). An objection to this, is the fact that even the more \n\nequidimensional features generated by vertical eddies would probably tend to display a \n\nrandom localization in the HV and have a sub-circular (or semi-circular) geometry, \n\nrather than corresponding to sets of crescentic depressions with scarps systematically \n\norientated downslope located on morphologic steps of the seafloor, as observed in the \n\npresent case. In addition, this mechanism also does not provide a clear explanation for \n\nthe formation of the observed upslope sedimentary bodies. \n\nAnother possibility corresponds to admit that the crescentic scarps could \n\nrepresent the scars of major landslides triggered by tectonic events, which would later \n\nbe reworked and filled in with sediments by the action of bottom currents, in a similar \n\nmanner to the formation of the ?infill drifts? (Rebesco and Stow, 2001).  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4.2.2. Turbidity currents  \n\n \n\nThe existence of erosive crescentic scarps consistently oriented downslope along \n\nthe Horseshoe Valley main drainage axis (see Fig. 5.2B), strongly suggests the \n\ncontribution of downslope turbity currents to the formation of these features. Such \n\ncurrents have previously been reported to interact with seafloor localized morphologies \n\ncausing simultaneous erosion (scouring) and (re)deposition (Fildani et al., 2006; \n\nAlexander, 2008; Lamb et al., 2008; Heinio and Davies, 2009; Normark et al., 2009).  \n\nIn the Monterey East system Fildani et al. (2006) studied several features that \n\noriginated in a field of sandwaves, geometrically similar to the ones described here. \n\nFollowing previous theoretical (Parker and Izumi, 2000; Sun and Parker, 2005) and \n\nlaboratory (Koyama and Ikeda, 1998; Taki and Parker, 2005) work, the cited authors \n\nmodelled the formation of linear sets of crescentic giant scours based on the idea of \n\ncyclic steps. The formation of cyclic steps (Fig. 5.9A) is determined by the occurrence \n\nof hydraulic jumps (Fig. 5.9B), in which a flow makes a rapid change from thin, rapid \n\nsupercritical flow (Froude number>1) to thick, tranquil sub-critical flow (Froude  \n\nnumber<1, Fildani et al., 2006; Normark et al., 2009). According to these ideas, in the \n\nHorseshoe Valley, the flow of an overriding turbidity current could be forced to \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\naccelerate to supercritical velocities (i.e. with a Froude number>1) as a consequence of \n\nstraightening caused by the seafloor uplift on the hanging wall of the blind thrusts \n\nunderlying the studied crescentic depressions (see Fig. 5.9). When passing one of these \n\nobstacles the flow would be abruptly slowed, increasing in height and dissipating some \n\nof its own kinematic energy through turbulence (hydraulic jump; see Fig. 5.9B). \n\nUpstream of the hydraulic jump the occurrence of high bed shear stress would locally \n\nfavour erosion, while downstream of the jump, very rapid deposition would be favoured \n\n(see Fig. 5.9B). These two areas would move in tandem upstream, forcing the hydraulic \n\njump in the same direction (see Fig. 5.9A, Fildani et al., 2006; Alexander, 2008; Lamb \n\net al., 2008; Heinio and Davies, 2009; Normark et al., 2009). \n\nIt should be noted that unlike the features studied by Fildani et al. (2006), the \n\ncrescentic depressions described in the present paper are not aligned in one single linear \n\ntrain, but rather scattered along a broad area (see Fig. 5.3). These different spatial \n\nconfigurations are probably due to the broad and curved geometry of the thalweg in the \n\nupper part of the Horseshoe Valley (see Fig. 5.2B), which forces the flow to spread and \n\nsub-divide. On the other hand, some degree of lateral alignment (Fig. 5.3B) concurs \n\nwith the tectonic control determined by the existent underlying blind thrusts (see above \n\nsection 5.4.1.). \n\n \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9 - Hypothetical adaptation of the conceptual model of cyclic steps (as proposed by Fildani et \n\nal., 2006) to the studied crescentic depressions in the Horseshoe Valley.

Interplay between active tectonics and turbidity currents \n\n \n\nThe above discussion of the possible hydrodynamic models, shows that the \n\ncontribution of bottom currents for the formation of the study crescentic features should \n\nnot be discarded, namely in view of previously reported interpretations for similar \n\nfeatures in somewhat different contexts (e.g. Bulat and Long, 2001; Stow et al., \n\n2002a,b; Verdicchio and Trincardi, 2006; Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2008). However, in \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nthe present case, the observed crescentic shape of the studied depressions, as well as \n\ntheir particular architecture resulting from simultaneous erosion and deposition, are still \n\ndifficult to explain exclusively as the result of these processes. Because of this, the \n\ncontribution of downslope turbidity currents should also be considered, and in the face \n\nof the presently available dataset, the formation and upstream migration of a \n\ntectonically controlled hydraulic jump seemingly provides a simpler explanation for the \n\nparticular crescentic shape of the observed erosional scarps and associated upslope \n\nsedimentary bodies. In accordance, the following events must be considered to explain \n\nthe origin of the crescentic depressions (Fig. 5.10): \n\na) Active blind thrusting was responsible for the formation of several \n\nmorphological steps in the smooth seafloor of the Horseshoe Valley (Fig. 5.10A-B). \n\nb) These abrupt linear slope breaks can originate gravity instabilities that exhibit \n\ncrescent-shaped scarps. These scarps localize the downslope turbidity currents (Fig. \n\n5.10B, inset), triggering the formation of a hydraulic jump, inducing scouring upstream \n\nof the jump and simultaneous prograding sedimentation of the eroded material \n\ndownstream (Fig. 5.10B-C). \n\nc) The fact that some of the progradational sedimentary lobes are buried and \n\nincised by shallower ones, strongly suggests a tectonic reactivation of the main blind \n\nthrusts, thus resetting the whole process, steepening the eroded retreated escarpments, or \n\nforming new ones, retriggering scouring and prograding sedimentation (Fig. 5.10D-E). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.10 \u2013 Schematic representation of the main succeeding events envisaged as leading to the \n\nformation of the crescentic depressions in the Horseshoe Valley seafloor.

The possible role of fluid escape processes \n\n \n\nBesides tectonics and scouring associated with the downslope currents, the \n\nmiddle resolution seismic data also reveals the possible importance of fluid escape \n\nprocesses, in the formation of the crescentic depressions as discussed elsewhere in the \n\ntext and shown in Figs. 5.6, 5.8 and in the bathymetry (see Figs. 5.3, 5.4). The \n\nassumption that the dome localized close to crescentic depression 3 can be related to \n\nfluid escape processes is based not only on the transparent character of a shallow \n\nstratigraphic unit, but also by the fact that in the Gulf of Cadiz, particularly in the \n\nshallow sediments of the accretionary wedge domain, several tectonically controlled \n\nmud volcanoes and pockmarks of similar dimensions (Fig. 5.1A) have also been \n\nreported by other authors (e.g. Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003). These are \n\ndescribed to be associated with widespread occurrence of fluid flow, and more recently \n\nwere also reported to exist at greater depths, close to the Accretionary Wedge \n\nDeformation Front (e.g. Hensen et al., 2007). Moreover, some asymmetrical pockmarks \n\nalso exhibit ground collapse geometries remarkably similar to the presently studied \n\ncrescentic depressions (Schroot et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003; Dimitrov et al., 2003). \n\nHowever, because there is only one of these structures nearby one of the studied \n\nfeatures, this mechanism alone could not account for the generalized origin of these \n\nfeatures, and should preferably be seen as one possible contribution amid the dominant \n\ncause related to the tectonic/turbidity currents interplay. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nChapter 6  \nThrust - wrench interference \n\ntectonics in the Gulf of Cadiz (Africa - \nIberia plate boundary in the North-\nEast Atlantic): insights from analog \n\nmodels \n\nJ.

The \n\nsubduction-related GCAW, which is crosscut by the SWIM faults, is also considered \n\nactive. If this is the case then some kind of tectonic interference patterns between these \n\nstructures should be expected to occur.

The results we obtained and the \n\ncomparison with the natural deformation pattern favor a tectonic evolution comprising \n\ntwo main steps: i) the formation of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge on top of \n\ninactive, Tethyan-related, basement faults (Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma); ii) subsequent \n\nreactivation of these basement faults with dextral strike-slip motion (~1.8 Ma to \n\nPresent) simultaneously with continued tectonic accretion in the GCAW. These results \n\nexclude the possibility of ongoing active SWIM wrench system cross-cutting an \n\ninactive GCAW structure. Our results also support a new interpretation of the SWIM \n\nwrench system as fundamentally resulting from strike-slip reactivation of an old \n\n(Tethyan-related) plate boundary. \n\n \n\nKeywords: SWIM wrench system; Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW); \n\nThrust - wrench interference; Analog modeling; Tethyan-related plate boundary \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n6.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is situated in the North-East Atlantic Ocean, west of the \n\nGibraltar Straights, offshore SW Iberia and NW Morocco (Fig. 6.1). This zone marks \n\nthe transition between the Mediterranean Alpine Collision Belt and the Atlantic Azores \n\n\u2013 Gibraltar Fracture Zone (AGFZ; see Fig. 6.1) and corresponds to a segment of the \n\nAfrica-Eurasia plate boundary previously described as tectonically diffuse (e.g. Sartori \n\net al., 1994; Medialdea et al., 2004). Accordingly, a variety of tectonic structures with \n\ndifferent orientations, corresponding mostly to W-NW directed thrusts and WNW-ESE \n\ndextral strike-slip faults (Fig. 6.1B), are thought to accommodate a WNW-ESE Present \n\nday convergence between Eurasia (Iberia sub-plate) and Africa (Nubia sub-plate) at a \n\nrate of ca. 4-5 mm/yr (Argus et al., 1989; DeMets et al., 1994; Sella et al., 2002; Calais \n\net al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2003; Fernandes, 2004; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; \n\nFernandes et al., 2007). \n\n The seismicity of this domain has been characterized as moderate, although \n\nseveral high magnitude historical and instrumental earthquakes are known (e.g.  Ms=7.9 \n\n28/02/1969 and and Mw=6.0,12/02/2007 earthquakes, respectively; Fukao, 1973 and \n\nStich et al., 2006, 2007). Among these, the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (estimated \n\nmagnitude of 8.5 to 8.7; Abe et al, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Martinez-Solares and Arroyo, \n\n2004) that triggered a devastating tsunami and destroyed the Portuguese capital \n\n(Baptista et al., 1998; Zitellini et al., 2001; Martinez-Solares and Arroyo, 2004). Despite \n\nrecent mapping updates of the main tectonic structures of this region based on the \n\ninterpretation of a great variety of newly acquired data (e.g. multi-beam swath \n\nbathymetry, reflection and refraction seismics, geodetic; Johnston, 1996, Gonzalez et \n\nal., 1996; Zitellini et al., 2001; Gutscher et al., 2002, 2009a,b; Baptista et al., 2003; \n\nGracia et al., 2003a,b; Mulder et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2004; Rosas et al., 2009; \n\nTerrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009), the precise location of the \n\nseismogenic/tsunamigenic source of 1755 major event is still the subject of ongoing \n\ndebate (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998; Buforn et al., 1988; Zitellini et al., 2001; Gracia et al., \n\n2003a,b; Terrinha et al., 2003; Gutscher, 2004; Gutscher et al., 2006; Terrinha et al., \n\n2009).  \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 - (A) Location of the Gulf of Cadiz area in the general tectonic setting of the Eurasia - Africa \n\nplate boundary. AGFZ - Azores-Gibraltar Fracture Zone; (B) Simplified tectonic map of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz area (adapted from Duarte et al., 2009, Terrinha et al., 2009, Zitellini et al., 2009 and Duarte et al., \n\n2010; bathymetry from the SWIM compilation; Zitellini et al., 2009).

(2009) - white lines. \n\nBlack dots correspond to the location of known mud volcanoes (e.g. Hensen et al., 2007).  \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nIn the tectonic map of Fig. 6.1B three main sets of structures are promptly \n\nrecognized: a) several NE-SW striking, westwards directed thrust faults (e.g. Gorringe, \n\nHorseshoe and Marqu\u00eas de Pombal faults); b) major WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-\n\nslip faults (the SWIM faults) and c) a major thrust bounding the so called Gulf of Cadiz \n\nAccretionary Wedge (GCAW frontal thrust). Structures of the first set have previously \n\nbeen described as active and, individually (e.g Gorringe fault), or together (Marques de \n\nPombal and Horseshoe faults), successively considered and dismissed as possible \n\nseismogenic/tsunamigenic sources of the 1755 Great Lisbon Earhquake (e.g. Baptista et \n\nal., 1998; Buforn et al., 1988; Zitellini et al., 2001; Terrinha et al., 2009). The other two \n\nsets of tectonic structures support the following two fundamental ideas for the \n\ninterpretation of the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic framework (Gutscher et al., 2002; Zitellini et \n\nal., 2009): \n\n \n\n- Gutscher et al. (2002), building on previously reported similar ideas (e.g. \n\nRoyden, 1993 and Lonergan and White, 1997), consider the tectonic evolution \n\nof this plate boundary as being dominated by active (roll back) subduction of a \n\nretreating east-dipping lithospheric slab, presently positioned beneath the \n\nGibraltar Arc (Fig. 6.1B). Accordingly, associated synthetic accretion of \n\nsediments is also reported to occur, represented by the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nAccretionary Wedge (GCAW, Fig. 6.1B), in which several imbricated west-\n\ndirected active thrusts accommodate on-going shortening. \n\n \n\n- Zitellini et al. (2009) argue for the existence of a broad transpressive \n\ndeformation band, comprising a set of WNW-ESE striking, subvertical, dextral \n\nstrike-slip faults (SWIM faults in Fig. 6.1B), which as a whole extend for more \n\nthan 600 km, from the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz to the southern limit of \n\nthe Gorringe bank. These faults are interpreted by the cited authors as \n\nlithospheric faults, and in view of that the SWIM fault system was proposed to \n\nmark a newly formed plate boundary connecting the AGFZ to the Rif Mountain \n\nbelt in northern Morocco. \n\n \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\nIt should be noted that Zitellini et al. (2009) considered the dextral transcurrent \n\nSWIM faults in the Gulf of Cadiz as presently active, and cutting the GCAW thrusts, \n\nwhose activity is considered to be negligible since late Miocene times. Conversely, \n\nGutscher et al. (2002) consider the GCAW thrusts as still active, and as referred above \n\nrelated with Present day on-going subduction beneath the Gibraltar Arc. \n\n In the present work, we test the above assumptions using analog modeling sand-\n\nbox experiments to model the interference between the two major tectonic systems in \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. SWIM dextral wrenching and GCAW thrusting, assuming three \n\nmain different possibilities: \n\n \n\n1) The GCAW is presently active and the SWIM faults are thought to correspond \n\nto inactive basement faults, inherited from a previous tectonic evolution; \n\n \n\n2) The SWIM faults are thought to correspond to major, presently active, dextral  \n\nstrike-slips, cutting a previously formed inactive GCAW; \n\n \n\n3) Both tectonic systems are presently active. \n\n \n\nThorough comparison of the obtained results with the observed natural \n\nmorphotectonic pattern is carried out for each of the above cases. Accordingly, resulting \n\ntectonic implications for the local and whole scale evolution of this segment of the \n\nEurasia-Africa plate boundary are carefully evaluated and explored. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n6.2. Morphotectonic characterization of the study \n\narea \n\n \n\n The morphology of the Gulf of Cadiz is largely controlled by the main tectonic \n\nprocesses in the area: the thrusting accommodating the GCAW accretion and the \n\nwrenching associated to the SWIM fault system. The high-resolution bathymetry of the \n\nGCAW shows a west dipping U-shaped body (Figs. 6.1B and 6.2A) that extends for \n\nmore than 250 km from about longitude 7\u00baW to 9\u00ba30\u2018W, with depths ranging from 200 \n\nto 4300 meters. It narrows slightly to the west with a width varying from 160 to 140 km \n\n(see Fig. 6.1B and 6.2A). Its wrinkled surface morphology is shaped not only by thrust-\n\nrelated slope breaks and associated folds, which define a large scale stepping \n\nmorphology, but is also the result of the different combined manifestations of \n\ngravitational and fluid escape processes (e.g. ?raft-tectonics? type features, sub-circular \n\ncollapse depressions, mud volcanoes, salt diapirs; Mulder et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., \n\n2003; Gutscher et al., 2009b; Zitellini et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). From a \n\nstructural point of view, the accretionary wedge corresponds to an eastward thickening \n\npile of westwards thrust sediments (Fig. 6.2B and C), reaching a maximum thickness of \n\nca. 15 km near the Gibraltar Straits (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006; Gutscher et al., \n\n2009a). The thrusts root in a common sub-horizontal to gently east dipping d\u00e9collement \n\nlayer, exhibiting an overall geometry complying with on-going eastwards subduction \n\nbeneath the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002). During the last 5 Ma the E-W \n\nconvergence rate implied in such a subduction is thought to have diminished from ca. 2 \n\ncm/yr to 0.5 cm/yr (Gutscher et al., 2009a), with a consequent decrease in the activity of \n\nthe wedge thrusts during this time span. Accordingly, the same authors argue that the \n\nPresent day internal deformation is preferably accommodated by small increments of \n\nlocal reactivation of inherited blind thrusts, being more homogeneously distributed over \n\nthe entire wedge, rather than concentrated on newly formed major frontal thrusts.  \n\nThe morphologic expression of the SWIM faults corresponds to a continuous \n\nalignment of seafloor crests and troughs, sometimes exhibiting an en echelon \n\ngeometrical disposition, and commonly punctuated by active mud volcanoes within the \n\ndomain of the accretionary wedge (see Fig. 6.1B; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., \n\n2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). This overall linear morphology is more prominent both \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nclose to the northern part of the GCAW front and in the Horseshoe Valley, where \n\nlineaments can be followed almost continuously for more than 200 kilometers (e.g. \n\nSWIM 1 in Fig. 6.1B and 6.3A). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 - (A) Perspective view (from southwest) of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge surface and \n\nadjacent areas; (B) Delsis Multichannel seismic profile across the accretionary wedge deformation front \n\n(see Fig. 6.2A for location) and (C) respective interpretation.  \n \n\nThe available reflection seismic dataset in the study area shows that the SWIM \n\nfaults correspond to aligned arrays of deep-rooted faults, often breaching out through \n\nPresent day seafloor sediments and showing extensive evidence for associated fluid \n\nmigration (e.g. seismic blanking along fluid extrusion paths in Fig. 6.3B and C; Rosas et \n\nal., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). From the inspection of the IAM 4 and 3 seismic \n\nprofiles in Fig. 6.3, it is apparent that the SWIM faults are aligned along basement pre-\n\nexistent (Mesozoic) faults (dashed black lines in Fig. 6.3; see also Duarte et al., 2009 \n\nand Terrinha et al., 2009). Analog modeling of sets of en echelon folds formed in soft-\n\ncover sediments overlying some of the SWIM basement dextral strike-slips (Rosas et \n\nal., 2009) yielded an age for their activeness of ca. 1.8 Ma. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3 - (A) Perspective view (from southwest) of the SWIM lineaments; (B) Multichannel seismic \n\nprofiles IAM-4 and IAM-3 crosscutting SWIM fault 1 and (C), and respective interpretation; note the \n\nMesozoic rift-related faults (black dashed lines).

The SWIM-GCAW interference area \n\n \n\nThe critical area to understand the interference between the SWIM strike-slips \n\nand the GCAW is close to its deformation front (Fig. 6.4A). Along this front, from \n\nNorth to South, three interference sub-areas were thoroughly analyzed (B to D in Fig. \n\n6.4).  The SWIM 2 fault intersects a northern segment of the GCAW front (Fig. 6.4B) in \n\nthe vicinity of the Sagres Valley, at an angle of about 40\u00ba. Within the thrust wedge to \n\nthe East, the morphological expression of the SWIM 2 is well marked by a slightly \n\narched trough that splays in the same direction. Conversely, in the Sagres Valley it is \n\nalmost indiscernible due to the widespread presence of scours and slumps, and it is only \n\ndetectable by the presence of a gentle slope break. In this area no offset of the wedge \n\ndeformation front is observed, instead only a small wrinkled WNW-ESE elongate bulge \n\ncan be detected in the bathymetry of the frontal GCAW (see Fig. 6.4B). The SWIM 1 \n\nfault exhibits a clear morphological expression in the Horseshoe Valley, intersecting the \n\nwedge deformation front just to the north of the Coral Patch Ridge, at an angle of about \n\n70\u00ba (Fig. 6.4C). Its continuation to the East is less visible, although punctuated by mud \n\nvolcanoes. Similarly to what was described for the SWIM 2 fault, there is no \n\nbathymetric evidence for the offset of the wedge front by the SWIM 1 fault. The SWIM \n\n3 fault cuts along the southern flank of the Coral Patch Ridge with a strong \n\nmorphological imprint (Fig. 6.4D), corresponding to a lineament marked by several \n\nelongated WNW-ESE ridges, troughs and slope breaks. To the East, this lineament \n\ncrosses a small portion of the Seine Abyssal Plain and intersects the accretionary wedge \n\ndeformation front, at an angle of about 80\u00ba. In this location the wedge front is marked \n\nby a slight embayment. On the wedge surface to the north of the fault and parallel to it, \n\nan elongated protuberance is also unmistakably observed, limited by two descending \n\nslope breaks and vanishing progressively towards the East. As in the two cases \n\ndescribed above, the observed morphology does not account for any kind of fault offset \n\noverprint relationships.  \n\n \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4 - General (A) and detailed (B, C and D) bathymetric imaging and respective morphotectonic \n\ninterpretation (B\u2018, C\u2018, and D\u2018) of the interference area between the accretionary wedge deformation front \n\nand the SWIM 1, 2 and 3 strike-slip faults.

Analog Modeling \n\n \n\n Our objective is to test several simple chronological possibilities of mechanical \n\ninterference between a strike-slip fault and a thrust wedge front, under model conditions \n\ncomparable to the ones governing the SWIM-GCAW tectonic interference. Three main \n\nexperiments were carried out to investigate the different deformation patterns resulting \n\nfrom: a) A thrust wedge developed on top of an inactive basement (strike-slip) fault; b) \n\nAn active dextral strike-slip fault affecting an inactive thrust wedge; c) The \n\nsimultaneous alternate activity of a thrust wedge front and a dextral strike-slip fault. \n\nExperiments were performed to respect the general, simplified, geometry, kinematics \n\nand rheology ascribed to the natural strike-slip (SWIM) system, and to the (GCAW) \n\nthrust wedge. However, analog modeling with dry granular materials cannot reproduce \n\nall the complex processes (e.g. fluid overpressure and expulsion, sedimentary \n\ndeposition, and local gravitational instabilities) which occur in submarine environments. \n\nNevertheless, the regional kinematic and relative timing caused by the local tectonic \n\ndriving forces and the ensuing structural evolution can be well investigated.      \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.1. Experimental method \n\n \n\n6.3.1.1. Material properties and scaling \n\n  \n\nThe material used as an analog of the GCAW sedimentary rocks was dry quartz \n\nsand, whose properties are summarized in Table 6.1. Sand is considered a Coulomb \n\nmaterial deforming in a brittle way according to the Coulomb fracture criterion (e.g. \n\nHubbert, 1937, 1951; Davis et al., 1983, Appendix 6.A), and it has been extensively \n\nused in scaled model experiments simulating similar brittle deformation in the upper \n\ncrust (e.g. Mandl et al., 1977; Davis et al., 1983; Malavieille, 1984; Mulugeta, 1988; \n\nMalavieille et al., 1991; Liu et al., 1992; Gutscher et al., 1998a,b; Casas et al., 2001; \n\nMarques and Cobbold, 2002; Le Guerroue and Cobbold, 2006; Rosas et al., 2009; \n\nGutscher et al., 2009a; Malavieille, 2010). The present models were properly scaled \n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\naccording to the scale model theory of Hubbert (1937). The assumed model - prototype \n\nratios are presented in Table 6.1, and the detailed procedure of scaling is specified in \n\nAppendix 6.A  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.1 - Parameters and material properties \n\n \n\nNote: \n\n- Scaled fundamental units are in bold \n\n- A mean cohesion of Co=40 MPa was assumed from the natural prototype (e.g. Hoshino et al., 1972; Weijermars et al., 1993) \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.1.2. Apparatus and initial stage  \n\n \n\nExperiments were done using a rectangular 100cm \u00d7 60cm Perspex deformation \n\nrig, comprising two laterally juxtaposed basal plates and a moving backstop (Fig. 6.5A). \n\nIn the initial stage of the experiments, 1cm thick layered sand cake was built on top of \n\nthe basal rigid plates by pouring batches of differently colored sand from a moving \n\nelongated funnel, guarantying the leveling of its top surface. The basal plates in the \n\nmodel move laterally relatively to each other, and account for the natural basement \n\nbeneath the thrust wedge d\u00e9collement (see Fig. 6.2C). The vertical contact plane \n\nbetween these plates complies with the dominant WNW-ESE orientation of the SWIM 1 \n\nfault system (see Fig. 6.1 and 6.4). The model sand cake corresponds to the overlying \n\ncover sediments, in which accretion is simulated by pushing against it a backstop that \n\nParameters and material properties \nQuartz sand \n\n(model) \n\nNatural \n\nprototype \n\nRatio: \n\nModel/Nature \n\nComposition (%) 99.7 % quartz - - \n\nGrain shape well-rounded - - \n\nGrain size (mm)  &lt;0.30 - - \n\nDensity (kgm\n-3\n\n) 1300 2600 ? = 0.5 \n\nInternal friction angle, ???\u00ba?? ~30 - - \n\nCoefficient of internal friction, ?c ~0.6 0.6-0.85 - \n\nCohesion, c0 (Pa) negligible 40x10\n6 \n\n - \n\nGravity accelaration, g (ms\n-2\n\n) 9.81 9.81 ?g = 1 \n\nLength, L (m) 0.01 5000 ? = 2\u00d710\n-6\n\n \n\nMass, M (Kg)  -  - ? = 4x10\n-18\n\n \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\nslides on top of both basal plates.

The final stage of the model was \n\nhumidified and serially sectioned for three-dimensional analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 - (A) \u2013 Sketch of experimental apparatus and model set-up at initial stage. (B) Model top view \n\nafter 20 % of shortening.  \n\n \n\n6.3.1.3. Procedure  \n\n \n\nThree main experiments were carried out two study three basic possibilities of \n\nmechanical interference between a strike-slip basement fault and a thrust wedge: \n\n1) Active thrust wedge and inactive basement fault: the backstop was initially \n\npushed against the sand-cake, on top of the two immobile basal plates. \n\n2) Active basement fault and inactive thrust wedge: after a thrust wedge was \n\npreviously formed in the sand, the basal plates were dextrally moved relatively \n\nto each other. \n\n \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\n3) Active basement fault and active thrust wedge: the reactivation of a \n\npreviously formed thrust wedge was successively alternated with the right-lateral \n\nmovement between the basal plates. \n\n  \n\n \n\n6.3.2. Experimental results \n\n  \n\n6.3.2.1. Experiment 1: active thrust wedge and inactive basement \n\nfault  \n\n \n\n Up until ~30% of shortening a thrust wedge was classically obtained, through \n\nthe forward propagation of regularly spaced thrusts, as a result of moving the backstop \n\nto the left (see Fig. 6.5B and Fig. 6.6A). For a shortening of 31 % (Fig. 6.6A) the front \n\nof the accretionary wedge developed an embayment coinciding with the direction of the \n\ninactive basement fault (yellow dashed line in Fig. 6.6A). For a shortening of 38 % a \n\nnew thrust (n+1 in Fig. 6.6B) was formed exclusively to the north of that basement \n\ndiscontinuity. Only when the shortening reached 39 %, did the equivalent new thrust \n\nform to the south, resulting in a misleading left-lateral offset geometry (yellow arrows \n\nin Fig. 6.6C), in spite of the total absence of relative movement between the two basal \n\nrigid plates. For a shortening of 48 % this false offset in front of the newer thrust \n\ndisappeared (Fig. 6.6D). In the wedge lower area a linear southeastward splaying, \n\nslightly anastomosing, deformation pattern (white lines in Fig. 6.6D) was progressively \n\ndeveloped as shortening accumulated and new outward thrusts successively formed. \n\n \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.6 - Results of Experiment 1: active thrust wedge and inactive basement fault.

Experiment 2: active basement fault and inactive thrust \n\nwedge \n\n  \n\nAfter 48% of shortening the basement strike-slip fault was activated with dextral \n\nmovement (Fig. 6.7). When the horizontal displacement between the basal plates \n\nreached only 0.2 cm, a thin elongated bulge formed coinciding with the basement strike-\n\nslip direction (Fig. 6.7A). At this stage no offset of the thrust wedge was observed. A \n\nfurther right-lateral displacement of 0.6 cm between the basal plates clearly offset the \n\nthrust wedge, preferably affecting its frontal outer thrust (Fig. 6.7B). For a displacement \n\nof 1.3 cm the strike-slip fault seemingly propagated inwards, but only across the \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\nfollowing three thrusts (Fig. 6.7C-D). The resultant model deformation pattern always \n\nshowed the preferential offset of the frontal thin part of the accretionary wedge, relative \n\nto its innermost domains that remained unaffected. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.7 - Results of Experiment 2: active basement fault and inactive thrust wedge.

Experiment 3: active basement fault and active thrust \n\nwedge  \n\n  \n\nAfter the formation of a thrust wedge due to 47% of shortening, a right-lateral \n\ndisplacement of 1cm was applied to the basal plates (Fig. 6.8A). As a result, a linear \n\nbulge formed in the sand foreland, along the strike-slip direction, cutting across the \n\nthrust wedge and offsetting its front. Similarly to experiment 2, the amount of right-\n\nlateral displacement diminished towards the thicker inner part of the wedge. \n\nSubsequently, another 0.4% of incremental shortening was applied to the model (Fig. \n\n6.8B). As a result, a new frontal thrust formed, but only to the north of the strike-slip \n\nfault. The resultant geometry mimics a false left-lateral offset of the outer frontal thrust \n\n(apparently n+1 in Fig. 6.8B), although careful consideration of the propagation \n\nchronology of the thrusts revealed a true dextral offset (affecting thrust n  in Fig. 6.8B), \n\ncomplying with the underlying basement fault kinematics. Further 1% of applied \n\nshortening (Fig. 6.8C) produced the new thrust (n+1) also to the south of the strike-slip \n\nfault, erasing the previously formed false offset. Another 3.5 cm of dextral strike-slip \n\ndisplacement was additionally applied to the basal plates (Fig. 6.8D), and as a \n\nconsequence, the wedge front was once more kinematically truly dextrally offset. Riedel \n\nfaults formed on the wedge surface displaying a clear en echelon spatial disposition, and \n\ninterfering with the preexistent stepping morphology associated with the thrust stacking. \n\nFinally, after another 2.6% of shortening (Fig. 6.9), reaching a total accumulated \n\namount of 51%, the frontal wedge offset was once again almost completely attenuated, \n\nalthough the total accumulated basal strike-slip displacement was of 4.5 cm \n\n(corresponding to 22.5 km). It should be noted that the previously formed linear en \n\nechelon pattern was preserved in the wedge surface, including in its innermost domain. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.8 - Results of Experiment 3: active basement fault and active thrust wedge.

Note the practical \n\nabsence of corresponding offset in the frontal thrust wedge. \n\n \n\n\n\n112 \n\n \n\n6.4. Discussion \n\n \n\n Experiment 1 shows that an active thrust wedge forming in cover sediments \n\nabove an inactive basement fault records the resultant mechanical interference in the \n\nform of a linear, inner splaying, perturbation of the wedge morphological surface (white \n\nlines in Fig. 6.6C-D). This formed as the result of the successive thrust propagation \n\nacross the basement anisotropy, which behaved as a mechanical obstacle for the lateral \n\npropagation of the frontal thrust. Since this basement anisotropy remains stationary \n\nrelatively to an external reference frame, and the thrust front propagates forward (to the \n\nleft), the resultant interference area between both these features migrates from the lower \n\nperiphery of the thrust front to its central domain (compare the position of the linear \n\nperturbation pattern in Figs. 6.6A to D). Comparison with the natural example shows \n\nthat the observed inner splaying lineaments in the GCAW (see SWIM 1 in Fig. 6.1B \n\nand SWIM 2 in Fig. 6.4B), could have originated simply as a consequence of \n\npreexisting inactive basement faults. This agrees with the fact that these lineaments are \n\nobserved in the inner thicker part of the natural thrust wedge, in the complete absence of \n\noffset of its thinner frontal part. \n\n Experiment 2 shows that an active basement strike-slip fault affecting an \n\noverlying preexistent thrust-wedge, must produce a clear offset of its thinner front, even \n\nfor minor increments of strike-slip basal displacement (1.3 cm corresponding to 6.5 \n\nKm). This offset vanishes rapidly towards the inner thicker parts of the wedge, affecting \n\nalmost exclusively the outer frontal thrusts. Comparison with the natural example shows \n\nthat if the GCAW is presently inactive, and cut by active dextral strike-slip (SWIM) \n\nfaults, then unambiguous offset of the GCAW front has to exist, which is clearly not the \n\ncase (see Figs. 6.1B, 6.2 and 6.4). \n\n Experiment 3 shows that if both the basal strike-slip fault and the thrust wedge \n\nare active, with alternating incremental fault slips, then the resultant interference \n\ndeformation pattern can be the cyclic repetition of the following three possibilities: a) \n\ntrue right-lateral offset of the thrust wedge front (see Fig. 6.8A and D); b) false left-\n\nlateral offset of the thrust wedge front (see Fig. 6.8B, similar to experiment 1 see Fig. \n\n6.6C); c) no offset of the thrust wedge front (see Fig. 6.8C and 6.9). It should be noted \n\nthat the absence of thrust wedge offset does not imply an absence of basement strike-\n\n\n\n113 \n\n \n\nslip displacement, which quite on the contrary is continually increasing. However, the \n\nalternation with the incremental shortening that drives the successive forward thrust \n\npropagation cyclically erases the offset of the frontal thrust wedge. Differently, the \n\nresultant linear en echelon interference pattern tends to be increasingly well marked, \n\nincluding in the innermost domains of the thrust wedge (compare the lineament in the \n\nFigs. 6.8A and 6.9). Similarly to experiment 1, the intermediate experimental stage in \n\nwhich a false left-lateral offset originates (see Fig. 6.8B), is here interpreted as the result \n\nof a delayed propagation of the newer outer thrust across the strike-slip fault, which in \n\naccordance seemingly behaves as a mechanical obstacle to such propagation.  \n\n In view of these results, and considering the fact that in the natural example the \n\nGCAW front is not offset across any of the mapped SWIM faults, one of the two \n\nfollowing tectonic scenarios is possible: a) either the GCAW is active, and forming over \n\na basement anisotropy (inactive SWIM fault?); or b) Both the GCAW and the SWIM \n\nfaults are active. The possibility of an inactive GCAW being cut by active dextral \n\nstrike-slip SWIM faults is clearly ruled out by the present experimental results.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.4.1. Tectonic implications \n\n \n\n The west Mediterranean tectonic evolution comprised the Mesozoic opening of \n\nthe Tethys Ocean (Fig. 6.10A; e.g. Maldonado et al., 1999; Gutscher et al., 2002; Gr\u00e0cia \n\net al., 2003a; Stampli et al., 2002; Jim\u00e9nez-Munt et al., 2010). This would account for a \n\nbasement tectonic anisotropy, hypothetically, either consisting in previous transform \n\nfaults, or in rift-related normal faults (Fig. 6.10A and B). In view of the presented \n\nexperimental results, the accretionary wedge (GCAW) is here interpreted to have \n\nformed on top of such basement faults (present day SWIM faults) as a consequence of \n\nroll-back subduction beneath Gibraltar. During this period (Middle Miocene to \n\n~1.8Ma?, Figs. 6.10C to E) these faults were probably inactive, although capable of \n\noriginating a linear-like perturbation in the GCAW surface morphology (experiment 1). \n\nAt same time, the main regional convergence direction between Iberia and Nubia \n\ngradually suffered a counterclockwise rotation, shifting from N-S (Fig. 6.10 B) to near \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\nWNW-ESE (Fig. 6.10E). Such reorientation is interpreted to have triggered (since at \n\nleast ~1.8Ma) a dextral strike-slip reactivation of the basement (SWIM) faults (Fig. \n\n6.10F), during a period in which the subduction driving the GCAW growth was still \n\nactive (experiment 3), although slowing down (Gutscher, 2009a). It should be noted that \n\nthis rotation of the main convergence direction also agrees with the general strain \n\npartitioning tectonic scenario previously proposed by Terrinha et al. (2009), according \n\nto which besides dextral strike slip faulting along near E-W orientated faults, northwest \n\ndirected thrusts also occur along NE-SW orientated tectonic structures (e.g. Horseshoe, \n\nMarqu\u00eas de Pombal and Gorringe faults in Fig. 6.1B).   \n\nOther indirect evidence supporting Present day SWIM and GCAW simultaneous \n\nactivity include the fact that, not only all known mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz are \n\nlocated on top of the accretionary wedge, but also the circumstance that most of the \n\ndeep mud volcanoes are symptomatically aligned and coincident with the SWIM faults \n\n(Fig. 6.1A). This suggests that the fluid migration and escape may be simultaneously \n\ncontrolled by the activity of both structures. If that is in fact the case, then the mud \n\nvolcanoes could be preferentially located in the intersection between the SWIM strike-\n\nslip and the GCAW thrust faults, with such loci providing good pathways for the fluid \n\nto ascend (Pinheiro et al., 2003, 2005; Duarte et al., 2005; Rosas et al., 2009; Zitellini et \n\nal., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009).   \n\n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.10 - Tectonic model: summarized, schematic representation of the main chronologic events \n\nleading to the formation of the Present day main tectonic features in the Gulf of Cadiz (stages A to D are \n\nmodified from Rosenbaum et al., 2002 and 2004; and complemented with Maldonado et al., 1999; \n\nMichard et al., 2002; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a and Terrinha et al., 2009).

In view of the presented experimental results, the observed morphotectonic \n\npattern of the frontal GCAW area is compatible with: \n\ni) The development of the GCAW on top of inactive, previously formed, \n\nbasement faults (present day SWIM fault system). \n\nii) The simultaneously (alternating) activity of the GCAW thrusting with the \n\nactivity of the SWIM-related dextral strike-slip faults. \n\n \n\nConversely, the comparison of the same experimental results with the natural example \n\nunambiguously excludes the possibility of active strike-slip faulting (SWIM system) \n\naffecting an inactive preexistent GCAW, implying that if the SWIM fault system is \n\nactive then the GCAW must also be presently active.  \n\n \n\n2. The main tectonic implications of the above conclusions comprise an initial \n\n(Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma) accretion of the GCAW sediments on top of \n\npreexistent Tethyan rift-related faults, preceding strike-slip reactivation of these \n\nfaults (SWIM system), simultaneously with decreasing GCAW activity (~1.8 \n\nMa to Present), as a function of counterclockwise rotation of the main Iberia-\n\nNubia convergence direction.  \n\n3. The modeling and morphological observations favor the interpretation of the \n\nSWIM fault system as the strike-slip reactivation of pre-existent basement faults. \n\nThis suggests that the SWIM plate boundary proposed by Zitellini et al. (2009) \n\nmay in fact correspond to the local reactivation of the older Tethyan plate \n\nboundary. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\nChapter appendix 6.A. - Scaling \n\n \n\n The material used as an analog of the upper crust sedimentary rocks was dry \n\nquartz sand, which is considered a Coulomb material deforming in a brittle way \n\naccording to the Coulomb fracture criterion (e.g. Hubbert, 1937, 1951; Davis et al., \n\n1983): \n\n \n\n                \n\n \n\nwhere     is the shear stress,    is the coefficient of internal friction (       , and \n\n   internal friction angle),    is the normal stress, and    is the cohesion of the \n\nmaterial. According to the scale model theory (Hubbert, 1937), proper scaling is \n\nachieved when the ratios between model and natural prototype are independently \n\nestablished for the three fundamental units of length (?), time (?) and mass (?): \n\n \n\n   \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n     \n\n \n\nwhere   = length,   = time and   = mass, and ( ) stands for model and ( ) for natural \n\nprototype. The Coulomb fracture criterion governs time independent deformation of \n\nbrittle materials like sedimentary upper crustal rocks, since yield stress is insensitive to \n\nthe rate of deformation provided that the inertial forces are negligible, as in the present \n\ncase. This means that   ratio is not needed for scaling in this situation. Length ratio ( ) \n\nwas chosen given the maximum dimensions of the deformation apparatus used in the \n\nexperiments (see section 3), and was conveniently established as         . In the \n\npresent case, of the two relevant material properties, coefficient of internal friction (  ) \n\nand cohesion (  ), the first is dimensionless, and approximately the same in both model \n\nand prototype, whereas the second has dimension of stress and thus must be scaled \n\naccordingly (Hubbert, 1937): \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n     \n\n     \n \n\n  \n\n  \n      \n\n \n\nwhere   and   are the model/prototype ratio for stress and for acceleration respectively. \n\nSince inertial forces are negligible when compared with gravity, \n\n \n\n     \n    \n\n    \n \n\n \n\n  \n       \n\n \n\nwhere    is the model/prototype gravity acceleration ratio. Thus, substituting     in \n\nequation (3) allows the following simplification: \n\n \n\n  \n     \n\n     \n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\n  \n         \n\n \n\nwhere   corresponds to the model/prototype density ratio. Substituting   and   in \n\nequation (5) by the respective values in Table 6.1, immediately allows the determination \n\nof the implied mass ratio         . It should also be noted that since   is generally \n\nclose to one (between 0.5 and 0.7, e.g. Withjack et al., 2007) the strength of the \n\nmaterials expressed by   is scaled with the lengh ( ). Given the fact that in the present \n\ncase          and since cohesion for upper crustal rocks is clearly typically less \n\nthan 50 MPa, it becomes immediately evident the utility of model materials with very \n\nlow cohesion (<100Pa), such as dry quartz sand, as analogs of upper crustal rocks.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\nChapter 7 \nDiscussion: The Gibraltar Arc and the \nSW Iberia (passive) Margin: a case of \nsubduction propagation or induced \n\nsubduction initiation? \n\n \n\nJ. C. Duarte \n\n \n\n(This chapter is presented in a paper format since it is being prepared to be \n\nsubmitted to a science journal) \n\n \n\n In this chapter, a discussion of the main ideas previously addressed in this Thesis \n\nis attempted, through a comprehensive integration of the diverse data and information \n\npresented herein (previous chapters, papers that are part of the thesis and papers in \n\nappendix).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nThe process of spontaneous subduction initiation at passive margins played a \n\ncentral role in the original Wilson Cycle concept. However, recent works showed that it \n\nis not feasible to form a new subduction zone in isolation from a previous existing one. \n\nThe unraveled tectonic framework of the Gibraltar Arc and the Southwest Iberia Margin \n\n(presented and discussed in the previous chapters) is here used as a case study to \n\naddress the role that orogenic arcs may have in the nucleation of new subduction zones \n\nat passive margins. An updated tectonic map of the Gulf of Cadiz (the foreland of the \n\nGibraltar Arc) is presented and analyzed in the view of the more recent published \n\nworks, and the possible tectonic reactivation of the Southwest Iberia Margin is \n\nevaluated within the context of the two main driving mechanisms accounting for the \n\nrecognized tectonic structures in the area: the westward over-thrusting of the Gibraltar \n\nArc and the Present day WNW-ESE dextral oblique convergence between Nubia and \n\nIberia. The role of orogenic arcs in the formation of new subduction systems is \n\nhypothetically proposed as of significant importance in plate tectonics. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\n7.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nThe Wilson Cycle is one of the most paradigmatic ideas in the plate tectonic \n\ntheory, stating that oceans form, evolve and finally close (Wilson, 1966). This process \n\nrequires that after a certain time of the evolution of an ocean, the passive margins \n\ncollapse and new subduction systems initiate. However, the process by which a passive \n\nmargin converts into an active margin is still controversial and fundamentally unknown \n\n(Nikolaeva, et al., 2010; Stern, 2002; Stern, 2004; Gurnis et al., 2004). There are even \n\nsubstantial doubts whether if it is possible to initiate a new subduction system in \n\nisolation from a previous existing one (e.g. Guarnis et al., 2004; Stern, 2004). Also, \n\ndespite the abundance of both passive and active continental margins on Earth, no cases \n\nof transition between these two types of margins has been identified (Nikolaeva et al., \n\n2010). The quest for the identification of an incipient subduction zone at a ?passive \n\nmargin? is a challenge in modern plate tectonics. A natural case study would permit to \n\nconstrain the previously amount of proposed models on subduction initiation (see a list \n\nin Nikolaeva et al., 2010; and Table 2.1 in Chapter 2) and allow a better understanding \n\non the forces driving and resisting plate tectonics (Guarnis et al., 2004).  \n\nThe margins of the Atlantic Ocean are generally described as the typical case of \n\npassive margins, often termed Atlantic type margins (Gibbs, 1984). However, there are \n\ntwo regions where Atlantic oceanic lithosphere is already being consumed in subduction \n\nzones: in the Scotia and in the Lesser Antilles arcs (Fig. 7.1, Deuser, 1970; Schellart and \n\nLister, 2004; Goren et al., 2008). These subduction zones are thought to have been \n\ntransferred from the Eastern Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic domain (Mueller and Phillips, \n\n1991; Royden, 1993; Goren et al., 2008), and have been described as potential \n\nprecursors to a system of convergent zones that might ultimately result in the closing of \n\nthe Atlantic Ocean (Mueller and Phillips, 1991).  \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz, i.e. the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc (or Betic-Rif Arc; Fig. \n\n7.1 and 7.2), is the third place that has been described as potential locus for a subduction \n\nto propagate into the open Atlantic (Royden, 1993), as the result of active roll-back of a \n\nnarrow oceanic corridor that once connected the Tethyan basin and the Atlantic \n\n(Gutscher et al., 2002). On the other hand, the proximity of the westward migrating \n\nGibraltar Arc to the Southwest Iberia Margin (see Fig. 7.2), together with the Present \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\nday WNW-ESE convergence between Nubia and Iberia, induces compressive stresses \n\nthat make this margin a strong candidate for the nucleation of a new subduction zone, in \n\naccordance to what was previously proposed by Ribeiro et al. (1996). The anomalous \n\nhigh magnitude seismicity in this area, such as the magnitude >8.5 Great Lisbon \n\nEarthquake of 1755 and the 28/02/1969 earthquake (M~8; Fukao, 1973), complies with \n\nsuch a scenario (Gutscher, 2004 and 2006; Ribeiro et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1 \u2013 Simplified tectonic map of the Atlantic and surrounding regions with the location of the \n\nAtlantic arcs (Scotia, Lesser Antilles and Gibraltar). Thick black lines indicate convergent plate \n\nboundaries; thick gray lines indicate divergent or transform plate boundaries (Adapted from Schellart and \n\nLister, 2004); grey areas roughly correspond to back-arc basins. \n\n \n\n\n\n123 \n\n \n\nUsing the Gibraltar Arc and Southwest Iberia Margin as case studies, the present \n\nwork aims at providing insights on the role that preexistent orogenic arcs may have in \n\nthe reactivation of passive margins and subduction initiation. The discussion is based on \n\nan updated tectonic map of this region, based on which the prevailing tectonic driving \n\nmechanisms that account for the observed structures were recently interpreted (see \n\nChapter 4; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Rosas et al., 2009, in appendix \n\nDuarte et al., submitted, Chapter 6). The key question concerning whether the Gibraltar \n\nsubduction zone is active and propagating into the open Atlantic domain, or practically \n\ninactive at its present location but a new subduction zone is nucleating westwards along \n\nthe West Iberia Margin (see Fig. 7.2) is also addressed and tentatively answered.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.2 \u2013 Location of the Gulf of Cadiz area in the general tectonic setting of the western Eurasia \n\n(Iberia) - Africa (Nubia) plate boundary. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \n\n7.2. The problem of subduction initiation at \n\npassive margins \n\n \n\nAssuming that various Wilson Cycles occurred in the last 1 to 2 Ga, the almost \n\ncomplete absence of oceanic crust older than 200 Ma suggests that new subduction \n\nsystems have to initiate repeatedly at passive margins in order to close the oceans that \n\nwere once formed (Goren et al., 2008). In addition, passive margins have long been \n\nconsidered the more logical place for subduction to initiate, for two main reasons: i) \n\nmost of the existing subduction zones are located along continental margins and ii) the \n\nPresent day state of relatively young oceanic lithosphere is only achieved if the oldest \n\noceanic lithosphere, which occurs at passive margins, is subducted before younger \n\nlithosphere (Goren et al., 2008; Nikolaeva et al., 2010). It is traditionally assumed that \n\nspontaneous subduction initiation at passive margins occurs when the cold \n\ngravitationally unstable oceanic lithosphere collapses into the asthenosphere, as \n\nconsequence of density excess due to its aging. However, several works showed that the \n\nstrength of the oceanic lithosphere also increases with aging and consequently does not \n\nmake it more susceptible to spontaneously collapse into the asthenosphere (see Fig. 2.2 \n\nin Chapter 2; Mueller and Phillips, 1991; see also McKenzie, 1977 and Cloetingh et al., \n\n1984;). This conclusion is supported by the existence of 170 Ma old oceanic lithosphere \n\nadjacent to the Northwest of Africa and the Northeastern American passive margins. On \n\nthe other hand, the geological record does not seem to reveal one single example of an \n\nAtlantic-type margin evolving spontaneously into an Andean-type margin (Mueller and \n\nPhillips, 1991). One way to overcome this apparent contradiction is to consider that \n\nsubduction initiation at passive margins may generally be induced by the proximity of \n\nanother subduction zone or by stress transference from a nearby subduction zone or \n\ncollision belt. Therefore, passive margins in the proximity of a mature subduction \n\ncomplex would represent preferential sites for trench formation (Muller and Philips, \n\n1991).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n125 \n\n \n\n7.2.1. The peri-Atlantic arcs and the \u201cinfection\u201d of the Atlantic \n\n \n\nThe Atlantic is almost entirely bounded by passive margins (see Fig. 7.1). \n\nHowever, according to some authors, the Atlantic has already entered in its closing \n\nphase (e.g. Mueller and Philips, 1991; Ribeiro et al., 2006). In fact, there are two \n\nregions where Atlantic oceanic lithosphere is by now being consumed in subduction \n\nzones: in the Scotia and in the Lesser Antilles arcs (Deuser, 1970; Goren et al., 2008; \n\nsee Fig. 7.1). These arcs seem to correspond to cases where the initiation of the \n\nsubduction was induced by the proximity of another subduction system. It was proposed \n\nthat these two systems formed due to stress transmission across narrow continental \n\nlandmasses that once existed between the Pacific and the Atlantic (see Fig. 2.5 in \n\nChapter 2; Mueller and Philips, 1991; Goren et al., 2008). Mueller and Philips (1991) \n\nused an interesting and particularly creative analogy to describe this phenomenon. They \n\nconsider that subduction zones may be introduced into a pristine oceanic basin (i.e. \n\nwithout subduction zones), in a way that might be viewed, figuratively, as a process in \n\nwhich an infected ocean (i.e. with subduction zones) comes in contact with, and infects, \n\nan uninfected basin. It should be noted that both the Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs are \n\npropagating along two transform plate boundaries that connect these arcs to the Mid-\n\nAtlantic Ridge (see Fig. 7.1). The third limit of this type in the Atlantic is the Azores-\n\nGibraltar Fracture Zone, which extends from the Azores triple junction (in the Mid-\n\nAtlantic Ridge) to the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc (see Fig. 7.1). This area was \n\nproposed to be the third place where an initial stage of this ?infection? process could be \n\noccurring at the present (Mueller and Philips, 1991; Royden, 1993). However, both the \n\nScotia and the Lesser Antilles arcs have retreated around 2000 km and their trenches do \n\nnot seem to have propagated laterally, along the adjacent passive margins (see Fig. 7.1), \n\ncontrary to the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc, where the deformation is propagating \n\nnortheastwards along the Southwest Iberia Margin (see Chapter 4; Terrinha et al., 2009 \n\nin appendix; and further in this chapter). We hypothesize that this difference may be \n\nrelated to the fact that the plates bounding the Gibraltar Arc, Nubia and Eurasia (Fig. \n\n7.2), are converging, which is not the case with the plates bounding the Scotia and the \n\nLesser Antilles arcs. This convergence may constrain the arc laterally inducing the \n\nmigration of the deformation away from it into the Atlantic. \n\n \n\n\n\n126 \n\n \n\n7.3.

Main tectonic features \n \n\n In the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic map shown in Fig. 7.3 it is possible to identify \n\nthree main tectonic systems: i) the subduction-related Accretionary Wedge (marked in \n\ngrey); ii) a set of WNW-ESE striking dextral strike-slip faults (the SWIM fault system; \n\nmarked in white); and iii) a group of NE-SW striking northwest-directed thrusts \n\nconcentrated in the Southwest Iberia Margin (marked in yellow). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.3 \u2013 Tectonic map of the Gulf of Cadiz and SW Iberia.

The Subduction-related Accretionary Wedge \n\n \n\nThe accretionary wedge occupies a broad area of the Gulf of Cadiz (see Fig. 7.3) \n\nand its influence on the seafloor is materialized by a west dipping U-shaped surface that \n\nextends for more than 250 km from about longitude 7\u00ba to 9\u00ba30\u2018. From the structural \n\npoint of view, this feature consists in an eastward thickening pile of westwards thrusted \n\nsediments that may exceed 10 km of thickness (Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006; Gutscher et \n\nal., 2009a; Duarte et al., submitted). The thrusts root in a gently east dipping \n\nd\u00e9collement layer, exhibiting an overall geometry compatible with on-going eastwards \n\nsubduction beneath the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002 and 2009a,b). The existence \n\nof a subduction zone in this area is supported by seismic tomography data, which shows \n\nan east dipping slab below the Gibraltar Arc prolonging 670 km deep into the mantle. \n\nThis subduction zone is believed to have developed within the Mediterranean Alpine \n\nCollision Belt and is a remnant of the subduction system that consumed most of the \n\nWestern Mediterranean Tethyan Ocean during the Cenozoic (Lonergan and White, \n\n1997; Rosenbaum et al., 2002). Gutscher et al. (2002) proposed that the subduction is \n\nstill active and retreating westwards along an East-West trending corridor of remnant \n\n(Jurassic) oceanic lithosphere. The presence of such an oceanic corridor was recently \n\nconfirmed by seismic refraction data (Sallar\u00e8s et al., 2011). Also, recent detailed \n\nstructural mapping of the Horseshoe Valley area revealed the existence of an intriguing \n\nset of kilometric crescentic depressions lying at depths between -4300 and -4700 m \n\n(Fig. 7.4A; see location in Fig. 7.3; see also Chapter 5 for a detailed study on the origin \n\nof these features - Duarte et al., 2010). The thorough analysis of seismic reflection \n\nprofiles from this area revealed that: i) the crescentic depressions are carved on the edge \n\nof morphological slope breaks (see Fig. 7.4A); ii) the morphology of the depressions is \n\nshaped by the interaction of downslope currents with this slope breaks; and iii) the slope \n\nbreaks are tectonically controlled by blind thrusts that root at the level of the \n\naccretionary wedge d\u00e9collement (see Fig. 7.4B). These blind thrusts are located to the \n\nwest and in front of the outermost limit of the accretionary wedge (thrusts marked in \n\ngrey in Fig. 7.3). These features are thus interpreted as the morphological (i.e. \n\nbathymetric) expression of Present day westward propagation of the accretionary \n\nwedge. \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.4 \u2013 A) Slope map of the Horseshoe Valley comprising the Crescentic Depressions studied in \n\nDuarte et al.

The NE-SW striking thrust system  \n\n \n\nThe generally NE-SW striking thrust system comprises mainly the Horseshoe \n\nfault, the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault, the Tagus Abyssal Plain fault and the Gorringe \n\nnorthern thrust (Fig. 7.3; Zitellini et al., 1999; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha et al., \n\n2003; Rovere et al., 2004; Zitellini et al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009; Cunha et al., \n\n2010). This thrust system extends for approximately 300 km from the Coral Patch \n\nRidge area (35.5\u00baN), towards the north, along the West Portuguese Margin until a \n\nlatitude of 38\u00baN, with an apparent en echelon spatial disposition (see thrusts marked in \n\nyellow in Fig. 7.3). The thrust structures have prominent escarpments reaching up to \n\n2000 meters in height and seem to root deep into the basement, possibly cutting into the \n\nmantle, as suggested by seismic imagery and deep instrumental seismicity (Stich et al., \n\n2007; Terrinha et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2010). According to \n\nTerrinha et al. (2009), this NE-SW striking thrust system is the result of the migration of \n\nthe deformation from the realm of the Gibraltar wedge to the west (onto the Horseshoe \n\nfault region) and to the north along the West Portuguese Margin. This migration is \n\nbelieved to have been caused in part by the rotation of the convergence direction \n\nbetween Nubia and Iberia since the Miocene (Terrinha et al., 2009). The same authors \n\nconsidered that these structures may be the expression of a new compressive \n\ndeformation front, away from the Gibraltar Arc and along the West Iberia Margin, \n\ncorresponding to the onset of its tectonic inversion, which could eventually lead to the \n\nnucleation of a subduction zone (Ribeiro et al., 1996). Note that in this region, the \n\nGorringe Bank (see Fig. 7.3) was shown to be mostly constituted by highly \n\nserpentinized mantle peridotites (Girardeau et al., 1998; Jimenez-Munt et al., 2010). \n\nSerpentinization, in addition to induced compression, can provide an efficient \n\nweakening mechanism that may facilitate lithospheric rupture and subduction initiation \n\n(Cloetingh et al., 1984; Masson et al., 1994). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\n7.3.1.3. The SWIM fault system \n\n \n\nThe SWIM fault system is a group of WNW-ESE striking subvertical structures, \n\ninterpreted as dextral strike-slip faults (Terrinha et al., 2009; Rosas et al., 2009), \n\nextending from the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz across the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain \n\n(see Fig. 7.3; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., 2009). The SWIM \n\nfaults were interpreted by Zitellini et al. (2009) as corresponding to a newly formed \n\ndextral transcurrent plate boundary connecting the Azores-Gibraltar Fracture Zone (see \n\nFig. 7.1) to the Rif Mountain belt in northern Morocco. The morphologic expression of \n\nthe SWIM faults corresponds to a more or less continuous alignment of seafloor crests \n\nand troughs locally punctuated by active mud volcanoes within the domain of the \n\naccretionary wedge (Hensen et al., 2007). Terrinha et al. (2009) and Duarte et al. (2009) \n\nshowed that these WNW-ESE structures seem to correspond to the dextral reactivation \n\nof basement normal faults probably formed during Mesozoic extensional events. \n\nFurthermore, the morphotectonic interpretation of strike-slip associated en echelon \n\nfolds, based on analogue modeling experiments, suggested that the dextral movement \n\ninitiated at least 1.8 Ma ago (Rosas et al., 2009).  The SWIM fault system may be \n\npresently acting as a transfer zone connecting the two main compressive systems (the \n\nGibraltar Arc/GCAW and the Southwest Iberia NE-SW thrusts).  \n\n \n\n \n\n7.3.1.4. Thrust-wrench tectonic interference in the study area  \n\n \n\n Assuming that the SWIM dextral strike-slip faults are active (Zitellini et al., \n\n2009) and cutting other (also active) structures, such as the Horseshoe thrust fault and \n\nthe accretionary wedge (Terrinha et al., 2009; Gutscher et al., 2002, Fig. 7.3), some kind \n\nof tectonic interference is expected to occur between these major tectonic features, \n\neventually expressed by complying cross-cutting relationships, or corresponding \n\ninterference structural patterns. Confirming this, Rosas et al. (submitted) reported, \n\ncharacterized and modeled the tectonic interference pattern between the SWIM 1 fault \n\nand the Horseshoe thrust fault, mostly consisting in secondary ?corner? faults \n\nconnecting the two tectonic systems as a result of ongoing thrust-wrench interference in \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\nthis specific area (see ?corner faults? shown in red in Fig. 7.3 and Rosas et al., \n\nsubmitted, in appendix). Likewise, based on analog modeling experiments, Duarte et al. \n\n(submitted; see Chapter 6) showed that the observed morphotectonic interference \n\npattern between the SWIM faults and the accretionary wedge thrust front is not \n\ncompatible with the possibility previously put forward by Zitellini et al. (2009), \n\naccording to which the accretionary wedge is presently inactive and cut by active \n\ntranslithospheric (SWIM) dextral strike-slip faults. These same authors showed that if \n\nthis was the case, an important dextral offset (at least c.a. 7 km) of the accretionary \n\nwedge deformation front should occur, and be plainly observed, which is simply not \n\nobserved in the surveyed bathymetry (Figs. 7.3 and 7.4; see Duarte et al., submitted). \n\nInstead, the same reported modeling results suggest that the easiest way to explain the \n\nobserved absence of cross-cutting relationships is by considering both the SWIM and \n\naccretionary wedge active (Duarte et al., submitted \u2013 Chapter 6). Also, based on the \n\nsame results these authors interpreted the SWIM system as the strike-slip reactivation of \n\npre-existent rift-related basement faults, originally formed during the opening of the \n\nAlpine-Tethys, rather than corresponding to the expression of the onset of a new plate \n\nboundary as previously proposed (by Zitellini et al, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n7.3.2. Was the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake a subduction-\n\nrelated event? \n \n\nOne major issue that should be taken into account when trying to understand \n\nsignificance of the main tectonic structures in the Gulf of Cadiz (and Southwest Iberia \n\nMargin) is the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake that had an estimated magnitude between \n\n8.5 and 8.9 (Johnston, 1996; Batista et al., 1998). The location of the source of this \n\nhistorical earthquake still remains one of the major unsolved questions regarding the \n\ntectonics of this area (e.g. Gutscher et al., 2002; Terrinha et al., 2009 and Zitellini et al., \n\n2009). Gutscher et al. (2002; 2004) argued that the 1755 earthquake requires a rupture \n\narea only compatible with a subduction zone plane and proposed the Gibraltar Arc \n\nsubduction as the most reliable source. Their argument was not only based on the \n\ngeological and geophysical data, but also in the fact that most of the large magnitude \n\nearthquakes (M?8.5) are generated in subduction zones. Accordingly, 11 of the 12 \n\n\n\n132 \n\n \n\ngreatest earthquakes (M?8.5) of the past 100 years occurred along subduction fault \n\nplanes (the exception was a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in the Himalaya collision belt). \n\nHowever, the Gulf of Cadiz subduction fault plane shows negligible instrumental high \n\nmagnitude seismicity. Gutscher et al. (2006) offers three possible explanations for such \n\nan absence: (1) subduction is inactive and has ceased; (2) subduction is active, but \n\naseismic; (3) subduction is active and a locked seimogenic zone exists, gradually \n\naccumulating stress until it releases the next great earthquake. Based on recently \n\nacquired seafloor and GPS data the authors favor the last hypothesis. Ribeiro et al. \n\n(2006) agree that the source mechanism of such a large earthquake requires generation \n\nat a subduction zone. However, they proposed that the source of the 1755 event was not \n\nthe Gibraltar Arc subduction, but an incipient subduction zone that would be presently \n\ndeveloping in the West Iberia Margin. Terrinha et al. (2009) proposed that the \n\nHorseshoe, Marqu\u00eas de Pombal, Tagus Abyssal Plain and Gorringe compressive \n\nstructures are the crustal expression of this hypothetical incipient subduction zone (see \n\nFig. 7.2 and 7.3). Some of these structures may be linked at depth and/or connected by \n\nlateral ramps, providing a possible and reliable source mechanism for the generation of \n\na seismic event such as the 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake.  \n\n \n\n \n\n7.4. An evolution model for the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nregion \n\n \n\n7.4.1. The formation of the Gibraltar Arc \n \n\nThe area that presently corresponds to the Gulf of Cadiz (the foreland of the \n\nGibraltar Arc) was initially formed during the Mesozoic as part of the more occidental \n\nAlpine-Tethys rift system (Fig. 7.5A), which comprised an oceanic domain separating \n\ntwo newly formed passive margins. (Dercourt et al., 1986; Sanz de Galdeano, 1990; \n\nSrivastava et al, 1990a,b; Maldonado et al., 1999; Rosenbaum et al., 2002; Stampli et \n\nal., 2002). At this stage, a continuous corridor of oceanic lithosphere probably existed \n\nconnecting the Alpine-Tethys to the Atlantic Ocean.  \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \n\nIn the Eocene-Oligocene, Africa and Eurasia were already converging (Fig. \n\n7.5B). This convergence started in the Upper Cretaceous and led to the reactivation of \n\nmost of the Gulf of Cadiz Mesozoic extensional structures (e.g. previous transform and \n\nrifted-related normal faults; Duarte et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). The North-South \n\nconvergence was accommodated by the northwards subduction of the Alpine-Tethys \n\noceanic lithosphere that extended from the SE Iberia to the western Alps (see Fig. 7.5B; \n\nRehault et al., 1985; Malinverno and Ryan, 1986; Dewey et al., 1989; Rosenbaum et al., \n\n2002; Jolivet et al., 2006). Since the Oligocene, the continental collision in the Alps \n\nabsorbed the bulk compression implied in the convergence of both plates and, as \n\nconsequence, the northwards Apline-Tethys subduction along Europe\u2018s meridional \n\nmargin slowed down and became primarily driven by the density collapse of the \n\nsubducting oceanic slab (op.cit). This, triggered slab roll-back, which led to the \n\nformation of the West Mediterranean back-arc basins and associated continental \n\nterranes, among which Sardinia, Corsica, Calabria and Alboran (Fig. 7.5C; Rosenbaum \n\net al., 2002; 2004). In the Middle Miocene, the Alboran terrane was migrating almost \n\nunimpeded in direction of the Atlantic Ocean. Note that if Africa and Iberia were not \n\nconverging the Gibraltar Arc could have ?invaded? the Atlantic Ocean, propagating in a \n\nsimilar manner to what is presently occurring in the Scotia and Lesser Antilles arcs. \n\nHowever, the continued convergence between Africa and Eurasia caused the narrowing \n\nof the East-West oceanic corridor existing between Africa and Iberia (see Fig. 7.5C) and \n\nled to the collision of the Alboran terrane with the SE Iberia and NW Africa forming the \n\nGibraltar (or Betic-Rif) Arc.  \n\nIn the Tortonian, the Gibraltar Arc was still migrating westwards, at the same \n\ntime as the accretionary wedge was forming synthetically with the associated eastwards \n\nsubduction of the Tethyan slab beneath Gibraltar (Fig. 7.5D; Lonergan and White, \n\n1997; Gutscher et al., 2002). At the Present day the Alboran block is nearly trapped \n\nbetween Nubia and Iberia, and the subducted slab could have been partially \n\ndelaminated. It is however debatable if there is in the Gulf of Cadiz enough oceanic \n\nlithosphere, attached to the slab, available to be subducted by roll-back (driven by slab-\n\npull). On the other hand, even though the subduction may be nearly locked, the N-S \n\ncomponent of convergence between Africa and Eurasia may also contribute to some \n\ndegree of lateral expulsion of the Alboran block (and the Gibraltar Arc). This could be \n\nalso contributing to the outward propagation of the accretionary wedge to the west even \n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nin the absence of major activity along the subduction plane. Such lateral expulsion, \n\ntogether with the counter-clockwise rotation of the Nubia-Iberia convergence direction \n\nsince the Miocene (see Fig. 7.5), may be causing the concentration of stress in the \n\nSouthwest Iberia Margin triggering the activity of the structures present there, since the \n\ncratonic Iberia would behave essentially as an undeformable rigid block (see Fig. 7.5D).  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 7.5 \u2013 Schematic reconstruction of the tectonic evolution of the Southwest Iberia Margin and the \n\nWestern Mediterranean region from the Mesozoic to Present (modified from Maldonado et al., 1999; \n\nRosenbaum et al., 2002; Michard et al., 2002; Terrinha et al., 2009).

The present-day tectonic driving mechanisms \n\n \n\nTwo main tectonic driving mechanisms can be envisaged as accounting for the \n\npresent-day active structures in the Gulf of Cadiz: i) the WNW-ESE convergence \n\nbetween Nubia and Iberia (see Figs. 7.3 and 7.5A; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich et \n\nal., 2006; Fernandes et al., 2007; Tahayt et al., 2008; Duarte et al., submitted) and ii) the \n\nwestward movement of the Gibraltar Arc (Gutscher et al., 2002; Tahayt et al., 2008; \n\nDuarte et al., submitted). \n\nThe first driving mechanism is a consequence of the overall convergence \n\nbetween Africa and Eurasia. In the Gulf of Cadiz this convergence is almost \n\nperpendicular to the NE-SW striking thrust system and sub-parallel to the WNW-ESE \n\nstriking SWIM system (see Fig. 7.5D). These two tectonic systems are thought to \n\naccommodate this convergence within a general overall scenario of strain partitioning, \n\nin which the NE-SW striking structures accommodate the thrusting/shortening \n\ncomponent and the more WNW-ESE striking structures (including the SWIM faults)  \n\naccommodate the dextral strike-slip movement (Terrinha et al., 2009). \n\nThe second driving mechanism has its origin in the westward roll-back implied \n\nby the eastward Gibraltar subducting slab that has led to the emplacement of the \n\naccretionary wedge in the Gulf of Cadiz since the Miocene. Evidence of blind-thrusting \n\nto the West of the accretionary wedge front (see Fig. 7.4; Duarte et al., 2010), suggests \n\nthat this system westwards propagation is still presently ongoing.  \n\nThis interpretation, according to which both driving mechanisms are active, is \n\nsupported by GPS data that show, not only a WNW-ESE ~4 mm.yr\n-1 \n\nconvergence \n\nbetween Nubia and Iberia, but also 3.5 mm.yr\n-1\n\n of oblique westward movement of the \n\nGibraltar Arc in relation to Iberia (Stich et al., 2006; Tahayt et al., 2008). One major \n\nquestion remaining is whether the seismogenic zone of the Gibraltar subduction system \n\nis locked, even if the Gibraltar Arc is still moving westwards. If this is the case, to what \n\nextent is this movement being accommodated to the west of the accretionary wedge \n\nforcing the activation of the Southwest Iberia Margin thrust system? Is the Gibraltar \n\nsubduction ?trapped? and slowing down, while the stress is transmitted to the West \n\nIberia Margin thus eventually favoring the formation of a new subduction zone?  \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\n7.4.3. The future of the NE Atlantic Gulf of Cadiz region: \n\nsubduction propagation or induced subduction initiation?  \n\n \n\nAt the present state of the knowledge it is difficult to quantify the specific \n\ncontribution of each of the two main driving mechanisms (WNW-ESE convergence \n\nbetween Iberia and N\u00fabia, and westward migration of the Gibraltar Arc) that best \n\ncomply with the evolving active tectonic framework in the study area. Further \n\nnumerical modeling could provide significant insight on this matter. Nevertheless, it is \n\npossible to speculate on the evolution scenarios that can be tested in the future, both \n\nthrough modeling and enhanced new observations provided by new geophysical \n\nsurveys. Two plausible evolution scenarios that can be foreseen as two competing end \n\nmembers are proposed and discuss:  \n\ni) Subduction propagation - The first scenario considers the westward roll-back \n\nof the Gibraltar subduction as the main tectonic driving mechanism acting in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz region (see Fig. 7.6A). Accordingly, the subduction could hypothetically continue \n\nto retreat and propagate westwards to Atlantic domain (see Fig. 7.6B-Alternative I). \n\nHowever, even though there apparent evidences of the westward propagation of the \n\nGCAW, the rate of migration of the Alboran Block/Gibraltar Arc seems to be \n\ndecreasing. It is possible that such a decrease is being primarily caused by the N-S \n\nconstriction imposed by the Africa-Iberia convergence, which may also be causing the \n\ndelamination of the subducting slab. Other mechanisms such as the approximation of \n\nhighly buoyant serpentinized basements highs (Gorringe Bank and Coral Patch \n\nSeamount; see Fig. 7.3) could also inhibit the bending of the lithosphere that together \n\nwith the entrance of ridges (such as the Coral Patch Ridge; see location Fig. 7.3) in the \n\nsubduction plane could contribute to the decrease in the subduction rate or even cause \n\nits total blocking. In this scenario, even if the subduction succeeds to propagate further \n\nwest into the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain domain, it will be hardly feasible to subduct the \n\nmore than 4 km high Gorringe Bank and Coral Patch Seamount. \n\nii) Induced subduction initiation - The second scenario considers the Gibraltar \n\nArc subduction system decreasing in activity (until it becomes completely inactive) and \n\nthe Southwest Portuguese Margin as being reactivated, leading to the formation of a \n\nnew incipient subduction zone (see Fig. 7.5B-Alternative II). If this was the case it \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\nwould be important to clarify, and if possible to quantify, what is the main mechanism \n\ndriving the reactivation of the margin: the westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc? \n\nThe WNW-ESE convergence between Nubia and Eurasia? Or both? It would be also \n\ncrucial to quantify the magnitude of the forces involved in this process, with the \n\nobjective of trying to understand if they are sufficiently high to overcome lithospheric \n\nstrength and to produce large scale bending of the lithosphere, which is required for \n\nsubduction initiation. \n\nEven though there are uncertainties on the role of the driving mechanisms \n\noperating in this region, it seems clear that a new convergent system is developing in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz. The formation of this system seems to have been induced by the \n\nproximity of the Mediterranean orogenic arcs (see Fig. 7.1). This hypothesis is in \n\nagreement with the Muller and Philips (1991) ideas that passive margins in the \n\nproximity of mature subduction systems are favorable sites for trench formation. This \n\ntype of passive margin induced reactivation (by stress transference) may be seen as a \n\nway to initiate a new subduction zone in a passive margin. Thus, the connection \n\nbetween pristine oceans to ?infected? oceans with active subduction zones, or the \n\nexistence of narrow landmasses in between, may have a crucial role in plate tectonic. In \n\nparticular, in the beginning of the closing phase of the Wilson Cycle. \n\n \n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.6 \u2013 (A) Schematic representation of the main thrust structures present in the Gulf of Cadiz and \n\nSW Iberian Margin (see Fig. 7.3); big grey arrows represent the two main tectonic driving mechanisms \u2013 \n\nthe westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc and the Nubia-Iberia convergence; (B) Present day \n\nschematic setting of the main thrust structures and two hypothetical evolution scenarios: Alternative I - \n\nthe Gibraltar subduction migrates to the Atlantic domain; Alternative II - a new subduction system forms \n\nin the SW Iberia Margin while the Gibraltar subduction progressively becomes inactive. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\n7.5. Conclusions \n\n \n\nIn this work it was tentatively addressed the problematic of the role of orogenic \n\narcs in the initiation of subduction at passive margins, using the Gibraltar Arc and the \n\nSouthwest Iberia Margin as case studies. To do so, it was analyzed an updated tectonic \n\nmap of the Gulf of Cadiz area (the foreland of the Gibraltar Arc). Our analysis showed \n\nthat at the Present day there are two tectonic driving mechanisms operating in the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz region: the westwards migration of the Gibraltar Arc and the local WNW-ESE \n\nconvergence between Nubia and Iberia. The Gibraltar Arc and the GCAW are part of a \n\nsubduction system that originated in the Western Mediterranean and seems to be \n\npropagating to Atlantic domain, however at a significant lower rate than in the Miocene. \n\nOn the other hand, the westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc, together with the \n\nPresent day Nubia-Iberia convergence, seems to be forcing/inducing the reactivation of \n\nthe Southwest Iberia Margin and the formation of a new incipient subduction zone. \n\nAccording to this scenario, the Gulf of Cadiz may be seen as a place where a pre-\n\nexistent subduction system is ?infecting? the Atlantic. Together with the Scotia and the \n\nLesser Antilles arcs, the Gibraltar Arc foreland may represent part of the nucleation \n\nlocus of a new subduction system that might ultimately lead to the closing of the \n\nAtlantic Ocean. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n140 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\nChapter 8 \nSynthesis and conclusions \n\n \n\nIn this chapter, the major out puts of the several subjects studied in this thesis are \n\npresented, outlining the main attained conclusions. Suggestions for further work are also \n\npresented in the end of the chapter.  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz tectonic structures \n\n \n\n? A new tectonic map of the Gulf of Cadiz was produced using the coupled \n\nanalysis of a multi-survey MCS dataset and the recently compiled high resolution \n\nSWIM bathymetry. The map depicts three main tectonic systems: i) the subduction-\n\nrelated Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (CGAW), materialized on the seafloor by a \n\nwest dipping U-shaped surface, which is the morphological expression of an eastward \n\nthickening pile of westwards thrusted sediments; ii) a set of WNW-ESE striking dextral \n\nstrike-slip faults (the SWIM fault system), extending from the eastern part of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain; iii) and a group of NE-SW striking northwest-\n\ndirected thrusts located in the Southwest Iberia Margin (the NE-SW thrust system), \n\ncomprising mainly the Horseshoe fault, the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault, the Tagus \n\nAbyssal Plain fault and the Gorringe northern thrust. Despite these main systems, other \n\nnew structures were recognized, such as the ?corner faults? connecting the SWIM \n\nwrench system to the Horseshoe thrust fault, the thrusts located in the Horseshoe Valley \n\nregion to which the crescentic depression are associated, and the NE-SW striking Cadiz \n\nfault, a major dextral strike-slip fault located in the northeastern part of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n142 \n\n \n\nThe crescentic depressions and the GCAW propagation \n\n \n\n? The morphotectonic mapping of the Gulf of Cadiz revealed a group of \n\nkilometric crescentic depressions lying at depths between -4300 m and -4700 m. The \n\ndetailed morphotectonic analysis of these features showed that they were formed due to \n\nthe existence of specific time-recurrent interaction between: a) regional active thrusting \n\non top of which most crescentic depressions are carved; and b) tectonically induced \n\nscouring comprising localized erosion and simultaneous progradational sedimentation, \n\nproduced by downslope currents of probable turbiditic origin. The thrusts on top which \n\nthe crescentic depressions are carved are active (mainly blind) thrust faults that root in \n\nthe GCAW d\u00e9collement layer to the west of its morphological deformation front. The \n\ncrescentic depressions are interpreted to correspond to the morphological expression of \n\nthe westward propagation of the deformation from the realm of the accretionary wedge \n\n(GCAW). \n\n \n\n \n\nThrust-wrench tectonic interference  \n\n \n\n1. SWIM-1 vs. Horseshoe Fault \n\n \n\n? Detail mapping in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain revealed the existence of a new \n\nmorphotectonic pattern near the intersection (corner zone) of the SWIM-1 fault and the \n\nHorseshoe fault. Based on combined analog and numerical experiments this pattern was \n\ninterpreted as resulting from the (thrust-wrench) tectonic interference between two of \n\nthe main tectonic systems recognized in the Gulf of Cadiz area: the SWIM faults and \n\nthe NE-SW thrusts.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\n2. SWIM faults vs. GCAW frontal thrusts \n\n \n\n? Detailed morphotectonic analysis showed that there are no apparent crosscutting \n\nrelationships between the SWIM faults and the GCAW. Physical modeling on the \n\ninterference between an accretionary wedge and a strike-slip fault showed that the \n\nobserved morphotectonic pattern of the frontal GCAW area is compatible with: \n\n \n\ni) The development of the GCAW on top of inactive, previously formed, \n\nbasement faults (Present day SWIM fault system). \n\n \n\nii) The simultaneously (alternating) activity of the GCAW thrusting with the \n\nactivity of the SWIM-related dextral strike-slip faults. \n\n \n\n? The comparison of the obtained experimental results with the natural example \n\nunambiguously excludes the possibility of active strike-slip faulting (SWIM system) \n\naffecting an inactive preexistent GCAW, implying that if the SWIM fault system is \n\nactive then the GCAW must also be presently active.  \n\n \n\n? Tectonic implications of the experiments on the tectonic interference between \n\nthe GCAW and the SWIM faults comprise: \n\n \n\ni) The formation of the GCAW on top of preexistent Tethyan rift-related \n\nfaults (from Middle Miocene to ~1.8 Ma);  \n\n \n\nii) Strike-slip reactivation of these faults (SWIM system) simultaneously \n\nwith decreasing GCAW activity (~1.8 Ma to Present), as a function of \n\ncounterclockwise rotation of the Iberia-Nubia convergence direction. \n\n \n\n\n\n144 \n\n \n\n? The analog modeling experiments together with the geological observations \n\nfavor the interpretation of the SWIM faults as corresponding to the strike-slip \n\nreactivation of pre-existent basement normal faults.  \n\n \n\n? The SWIM fault system is interpreted to correspond to the local reactivation of \n\nthe old Tethyan plate boundary, instead of the expression of the onset of a new \n\ntranscurrent plate boundary as argued by Zitellini et al. (2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz tectonic driving mechanisms  \n\n \n\n? There are at the Present two driving mechanisms operating in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nregion:  \n\n \n\ni)  The local WNW-ESE oblique convergence between Nubia and Iberia;  \n\n \n\nii) The westward overthrusting of the Gibraltar Arc. \n\n \n\n? The convergence of Nubia with respect to Iberia generates strain partitioning by \n\nmeans of dextral wrenching on the WNW\u2013ESE striking steep faults (including the \n\nSWIM faults) and thrusting on the NE\u2013SW striking thrust faults.  \n\n \n\n? The westward directed thrusting seems to be propagating from the realm of the \n\nGibraltar Arc to the west (Horseshoe fault) and to the north along the Portuguese margin \n\n(Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault, Gorringe northern thrust and Tagus Abyssal Plain fault). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n\nWestward Gibraltar subduction propagation or induced subduction \n\ninitiation at the Southwest Iberia Margin? \n\n \n\n? The Gibraltar Arc and the GCAW are part of a subduction system that originated \n\nin the Western Mediterranean. The detailed study on the crescentic depressions revealed \n\nthat the deformation related with the GCAW is still propagating westwards, however at \n\na slower rate than in Miocene, in agreement to what was suggested by Gutscher et al. \n\n(2009a). It is speculated that this deceleration is primarily caused by the constraining of \n\nthe Alboran block between the converging Iberia and Nubia.  \n\n \n\n? The westward movement of the Gibraltar Arc and the GCAW, together with the \n\nPresent day WNW-ESE local Nubia-Iberia convergence, may be forcing/inducing the \n\nreactivation (in compression) of the Southwest Iberia Margin.  This reactivation is \n\nmaterialized by the presence of a set of NE-SW striking major thrust faults (Horseshoe \n\nfault, Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault, Gorringe northern thrust and Tagus Abyssal Plain \n\nfault). The SWIM strike-slip faults may be acting as transfer zones connecting the two \n\nmain compressive systems (the Gibraltar Arc/GCAW and the Southwest Iberia NE-SW \n\nthrusts).  \n\n \n\n? A scenario in which the Gibraltar Arc subduction and GCAW is decreasing in \n\nactivity, at the same time that an incipient subduction zone is nucleating in the \n\nSouthwest Iberia Margin, is favored, in agreement to what was previously proposed by \n\nRibeiro et al. (1996). The Gulf of Cadiz may be thus seen as a place where the \n\nproximity of a pre-existent subduction system is ?infecting? the Atlantic, in a \n\ncomparable manner to what happen in the Scotia and in the Lesser Antilles arcs, \n\nhowever in an earlier stage of the process. Contrary to these two arcs, in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz the new potential subduction system seems to be propagating laterally along the \n\nadjacent Portuguese Margin.  \n\n \n\n? Finally, this work supports the speculation that the Gulf of Cadiz (Ribeiro et al., \n\n1996), together with Scotia and the Lesser Antilles arcs (Mueller and Phillips, 1991), \n\nmay correspond to the precursors of a subduction system that will ultimately lead to the \n\nclosing of the Atlantic Ocean.  \n\n\n\n146 \n\n \n\nSuggestions for future work \n\n \n\n? Perform a systematic MCS and high resolution seismic reflection survey (and \n\nsubsequent detailed tectonic cartography) in the area where the NE-SW thrusts are \n\nlocated. It would be important to understand if these structures are connected by lateral \n\nramps or if they root in a common structural level. This possibility could also be tested \n\nusing sand-box analog modeling and numerical modeling. \n\n \n\n? Carry out a systematic seismic refraction survey at the scale of the whole Gulf of \n\nCadiz, collecting several orthogonal profiles. This would be important to obtain a good \n\n3D rheological structure of the lithosphere. In particular, it would allow recognizing the \n\nnature and limits of the existing types of oceanic lithosphere, such as the Tethyan and \n\nthe Atlantic (both Nubian and Iberian). \n\n \n\n? Test the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic evolution models using 3D numerical modeling \n\nwith the main objective of quantifying the contribution of each driving mechanisms \n\nacting in the Gulf of Cadiz to the observed deformation pattern.  \n\n \n\n \n\n? Finally, collect cores and obtain a good coverage of high resolution seismic \n\nprofiles in the area where the crescentic depressions are located. A more detailed study \n\nwould allow a better understanding of the processes that lead to the formation of these \n\nfeatures. Also, if the crescentic depressions are controlled by tectonic activity, a detailed \n\ntectono-stratigraphic study of the existing buried features could provide constrains in \n\nthe timing of recent tectonic events. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAbe, K., 1979.

Multibeam swath bathymetry and interpretation of multi-channel seismic data\nindicate that these features can be interpreted to correspond to the seafloor morphological expression\nof active dextral strike-slip faults. Based on the interpreted data and recently published GPS plate kine-\nmatic velocity vectors of Nubia with respect to Iberia and the Alboran block (e.g. Fernandes et al.; 2003\nStich et al., 2006) we propose that the SWIM Faults are related to the general NW-SE convergence of\nNubia with respect to Iberia, and the Cadiz fault is related to the westward movement of the Gibraltar\norogenic arc.\n\nKeywords: Gulf of Cadiz, seafloor mapping, SWIM lineaments, Cadiz lineament, active tectonics,\nAlboran block, Gibraltar orogenic arc.\n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located in a complex tectonic area,\nencompassing the controversial SW Eurasia-NW Africa\nplate boundary (see figure 1). Some authors believe that\nthis is a diffuse plate boundary (Sartori et al., 1994;\nMedialdea et al., 2004), other describe an active subduc-\ntion with roll-back of a subducted slab (Gutscher et al.,\n2002), while others postulate a prolongation of a trans-\npressive deformation belt from the Rif-Tell (Morel and\nMeghraouie, 1996; Zitellini et al., 2009). This region\nexperiences a general NW-SE to WNW-ESE convergence\nbetween Nubia and Eurasia at a rate of 5-6 mm a-1 (Calais\n\net al., 2003). Stich et al. (2006) proposed that the SW\nIberian Margin is also accommodating a 3.5 mm a-1 of\nwestward motion of the Gibraltar arc relative to intraplate\nIberia. Seismicity is distributed over a more than 400 km\nwide zone between the Gibraltar arc and the Horseshoe\nfault (Fig. 1) and earthquakes are characterized by magni-\ntudes usually smaller than 5.5. In the western part of the\nGulf of Cadiz, in the area that encompasses the\nHorseshoe fault until the eastern part of the Gloria fault,\nseismicity is distributed over a narrower area and instru-\nmental seismicity is higher, with recent events of M=6\n\nTrabajos de Geolog\u00eda, Universidad de Oviedo, 29 : 237-241 (2009)\n\n\n\nand the 1969 event of M=7.9 (Fukao, 1973; Stich et al.,\n2006). Zitellini et al. (2004) described a number of active\nstructures scattered along the Gulf of Cadiz and SW\nPortugal showing that tectonic strain is presently accom-\nmodated between 35.5\u00ba N and 38\u00ba N (approximately\n250 km), which suggests a diffuse strain distribution of\nthe plate convergence.\n\nOver the last two decades a large amount of geological\nand geophysical data have been collected aiming at iden-\ntifying the main tectonic features present in the Gulf of\nCadiz and to clarify how deformation has been accom-\nmodated during Alpine to present times (Zitellini et al.,\n2009). In this work we describe the morphology and\nstructure of WNW-ESE and one NE-SW trending linea-\nments recently mapped in the Gulf of Cadiz region and\ndiscuss their tectonic significance.\n\nThis work is extracted from a much larger study based\non the analysis and interpretation of 180,000 km2 of\nmultibeam swath bathymetry and reflectivity\n\n(backscatter) data of the Gulf of Cadiz area and more\nthan 20,700 km multi-channel seismic profiles. This\ndataset was collected throughout several surveys car-\nried out by international teams of several countries\nand compiled for the ESF Eurocores EuroMargins\nSWIM project (Earthquake and Tsunami hazards of\nactive faults at the South-West Iberian Margin: deep\nstructure, high-resolution imaging and paleo-seismic\nsignature, REN2002-11234-EMAR, 01-LEC-\nEMA09 F) (http://www.swim.ul.pt/index_topo.htm)\nand NEAREST project (Integrated observations from\nNEAR shore sourcES of Tsunamis: towards an early\nwarning system, GOCE Contract n. 037119)\n(http://nearest.bo.ismar.cnr.it/).\n\nThe SWIM lineaments\n\nMorphology\n\nThe SWIM lineaments are linear features that strike\napproximately WNW-ESE and extend from the east-\n\nFigure 1.

ZITELLINI AND E. GR\u00c0CIA238\n\n\n\nernmost part of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge\nuntil the Horseshoe abyssal plain, south of the\nGorringe submarine mountain (Fig. 1). They cut across\nvarious morphological domains, contain various active\nmud volcanoes along their path and offset the NE-SW\nHorseshoe fault scarp (Fig.2), an active reverse fault\n(Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2004). These linear\nfeatures correspond to the alignment of elongated\ncrests and troughs on the sea floor with wavelengths of\nthe order of tens of kilometers. According to Zitellini et\nal. (2009), the longest of the SWIM lineaments,\nSWIM 1, exceeds 600 km, and it can be followed from\nthe Gorringe bank southern flank to the Morocco shelf\nand corresponds to a strike-slip fault. In some segments\nof this lineament it is possible to identify E-W-striking\nundulations with maximum lengths of about 8 km\n(Fig. 2). These features show an en echelon pattern that\ncorresponds to oriented folds of the recent sedimenta-\nry cover, allowing us to establish a dextral strike-slip\nmovement. The width of each individual SWIM linea-\nment is only of a few hundreds of meters.\n\nStructure\n\nThe interpretation of a segment of a profile across\nSWIM 2 lineament (Fig. 3a) shows that it corre-\nsponds to a fault that cuts through Mesozoic sedi-\nments (Unit A) (Tortella et al., 1997). This fault\nformed during the Mesozoic rifting as a normal fault.\nThis assumption is corroborated by the presence of a\nsyn-rift growth wedge (Unit B). The SWIM 2 fault\nwas later reactivated with a southwards reverse move-\n\nment because the wedge (Unit B) is over-thrusted\ntowards the SW. This reactivation probably occurred\nduring Paleogene to Miocene times (Rosas et al., in\npress; Terrinha et al., 2009). This movement seems to\nbe coeval with the installation of the Accretionary\nwedge (Unit D) since it clearly tapers towards the\neastern part of the profile. The SWIM fault also\ndeforms and folds the Plio-Quaternary unit (Unit E)\nand cuts through the seafloor. \n\nThe Cadiz lineament\n\nMorphology\n\nThe morphology of the Cadiz lineament is more\ncomplex than that of the SWIM 2 lineament. It is\nrelatively diffuse and occupies a broader area, with\nwidths varying from several hundreds of meters to a\nfew kilometers. It strikes approximately NE-SW and\nextends for about 200 km from the northeastern\nGulf of Cadiz continental shelf to the westernmost\n\npart of the accretionary wedge (Fig.1). The lineament\nis slightly curved towards the west at the south-west-\nern part where it meets the SWIM 1 fault (Fig. 1). It\nis materialized on the seafloor by the alignment of\nseveral different features such as crests, scarps, chan-\nnels and diapiric ridges (Somoza et al., 2003). The\nCadiz lineament is more prominent in its northeast-\nern segment, where it is adjacent to the Guadalquivir\nbank (a basement high with active seismicity) and it\nloses morphological expression progressively towards\n\nFigure 2.

(2009) and Rosas\net al. (2009). The small black\narrows show seafloor deformation\ncorresponding to NE-SW-orient-\ned en echelon folds. The white\narrows indicate the slope break\nthat corresponds to the morpho-\nlogical expression of the\nHorseshoe Fault.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF LINEAMENTS AT A TRANSPRESSIVE PLATE BOUNDARY: NUBIA-IBERIA 239\n\n\n\nthe SW, where it intercepts the SWIM 2 lineament\nand is almost untraceable in the surroundings of the\nSWIM 1 lineament.\n\nStructure\n\nA segment of IAM GC3 seismic profile (Fig. 3b) across\nthe Cadiz lineament shows that it seats on top of a fault\nzone. This fault is parallel to the deep blind thrust of\nthe Guadalquivir bank towards the SE, as interpreted\nin figure 3 (Unit A). This movement is corroborated by\nthe gentle folding of the reflectors of Unit A. It is also\npossible to observe a thin-skinned fault accommodat-\ning the over-thrusting of the accretionary wedge\ndescribed by Gutscher et al. (2002) towards NE over\nthe Guadalquivir basement (Unit D). This unit corre-\nsponds to imbrications of NNW-verging thrusts, as\nshown by the planar fabric of the acoustic facies. Near\nthe surface the more continuous cover sediments are\nclearly folded; however, they do not show evidences of\nmajor vertical displacement (Unit E).\n\nDiscussion \n\nBased on bathymetric and structural observations we\ninterpret the SWIM lineaments as the morphological\nexpression of dextral WNW-ESE trending strike-slip\nfaults rooted in the Mesozoic rift basin. This interpre-\ntation is derived from both observed coherent en ech-\nelon folding pattern on the seafloor associated with the\n\nfaults and the minor vertical displacement of the post-\nMiocene cover. This assumption is in agreement with\nrecent work by Zitellini et al. (2009) and Terrinha et\nal. (2009) that describes in detail the kinematic indi-\ncators and the age of these faults. Rosas et al. (2009),\nusing analogue models and the en echelon folds has\nmarkers for a quantitative strain analysis, suggested\nthat the SWIM lineaments initiated their strike-slip\nmovement 1.8 Ma ago, at least. This interpretation is\nalso in agreement with the general NW-SE to WNW-\nESE convergence between Africa and Eurasia at a rate\nof 5-6 mm a-1 and the fact that the SWIM faults off-\nset the Late Miocene movement of the Horseshoe\nFault. In this way, the SWIM lineaments can be\naccommodating a strike-slip component of this con-\nvergence, while the main shortening is being accom-\nmodated in the northwestwards directed thrusts of the\nSW Iberian Margin, for example the Horseshoe fault. \n\nThe Cadiz lineament has a strong morphological\nexpression, mainly in its northeastern part where salt\ndiapirs have extruded (Somoza et al., 2003). However,\nno kinematic indicators could clearly be detected in\nour analysis. It corresponds to an almost vertical fault\nthat deforms the sedimentary cover with no major ver-\ntical displacement. Based on recent data published by\nStich et al. (2006), that reported a 3.5 mm a-1 of west-\nward motion of the Gibraltar arc relative to intra-plate\nIberia, we propose that the Cadiz lineament is a major\ndextral strike-slip fault zone that is accommodating this\n\nFigure 3. (a) Multi-channel seismic reflection profiles IAM GC2, and (b) IAM GC3. The white dashed lines mark the fault zones cor-\nresponding to the lineaments (SWIM 2 on the left and the Cadiz Lineament on the right). The profile a) shows two previous vertical\nmovements of the SWIM fault (white arrows). On profile b) the following features are pointed out, reverse fault of the Guadalquivir\nbasement to the SSE; and a thin-skinned fault of accommodating the over-thrusting movement of the Accretionary wedge over the\nGuadalquivir basement. A: Basement; B: Sin-rift wedge (Mesozoic age); C: Post-rift unit; D: Accretionary Wedge unit (Miocene age);\nE: Cover unit (Plio-Quaternary age).\n\nJ. C. DUARTE, V. VALADARES, P. TERRINHA, F. ROSAS, N. ZITELLINI AND E. GR\u00c0CIA240\n\n\n\nrelative motion in the Gulf of Cadiz area. The lack of\ngood strike-slip kinematic indicators in this part of the\nstudy area is probably due to the higher rate of recent\nsedimentation associated with the proximal parts of the\nMediterranean Outflow Water and discharge of the\nGuadalquivir river as well as the extrusion of fluidized\nmaterial along diapiric ridges (Somoza et al. 2003), as\nwell as to the pure shortening at the front of the\nGuadalquivir bank thrust, as argued in this work.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work we studied various major tectonic linea-\nments localized in the Gulf of Cadiz area. We showed\nthat they correspond to major transpressive dextral\nstrike-slip faults with two different orientations: the\n\nWNW-ESE SWIM faults and the NE-SW Cadiz\nfault. Both faults are active and are probably related\nwith two different driving mechanisms. The SWIM\nfaults are related to the general WNW-ESE conver-\ngence between Nubia and Eurasia and the Cadiz fault\nis related to the westward expulsion of the Gibraltar\nArc relative to Iberia, possibly associated with the\nconvergence between the two lithospheric plates.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nIt is acknowledged the FCT PhD grant provided to support the\nwork of J.

A set of new multibeam bathymetry, multi-\nchannel and single-channel seismic data presented here image the main morphological features of tectonic\norigin of a significant part of the Gulf of Cadiz from the continental shelf to the abyssal plain. These\nmorphotectonic features are shown to result from the reactivation of deeply rooted faults that changed their\nkinematics from the early Mesozoic rifting, through the Late Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene collision, to the Pliocene\u2013\nQuaternary thrusting and wrenching. The old faults control deep incised, more than 100 km long canyons\nand valleys. Several effects of neotectonics on deep water seabed are shown. These include: i) the complex\nmorphology caused by wrenching on the 230 km long WNW\u2013ESE faults that produced en echelon folds on\nthe sediments; ii) the formation of up to 5 km wide crescent shaped scours at roughly 4 km water depth by\nreactivation of thrusts; iii) 10 km long creep folds on the continental slope; and iv) the formation of\nlandslides on active fault escarpments. The present day deformation is partitioned on NE\u2013SW thrusts and\nWNW\u2013ESE to W\u2013E strike-slip faults and is propagating northwards on N\u2013S trending thrusts along the West\nIberia Margin from 35.5\u00b0N to 38\u00b0N, which should be considered for seismic hazard.\n, Estrada da Portela, 2721-866\n214 719 018.\n\n).\naterina Basile, Toni Bermudez.\n\nll rights reserved.\n\u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Scope and objectives\n\nIn recent years the Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 1) has been recognized as a\nkey site to understand a broad spectrum of geological issues, such as:\ni) the tectonic evolution of the Africa\u2013Iberia plate boundary, the\nformation of the Gibraltar orogenic arc, the earthquake and tsuna-\nmigenic structures, the origin of the catastrophic 1755 Lisbon earth-\nquake and tsunami (Argus et al., 1989; DeMets et al., 1994; Sillard\net al., 1998; Maldonado et al., 1999; Kreemer and Holt, 2001; Zitellini\net al., 2001; Gutscher et al., 2002; Sella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2002;\nCalais et al., 2003; Terrinha et al., 2003; Fernandes et al., 2003; Gr\u00e0cia\net al., 2003a; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Medialdea\net al., 2004; Stich et al., 2006), ii) the Mediterranean Outflow Water\n(MOW) and its relation to sedimentation and climate changes (Ambar\net al., 2002; Somoza et al., 2003; Mulder et al., 2003; Hernandez-\nMolina et al., 2003; Voelker et al., 2006), iii) fluid escape and mud\nvolcanism (Somoza et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Van Rensbergen\net al., 2005; Pinheiro et al., 2006), and iv) chemosynthetic ecosystems\nassociated to cold seeps (Niemann et al., 2006).\n\nBehind this diversity of processes affecting the geosphere, the\nbiosphere and the hydrosphere, is a complex geological evolution of\nthe area throughout the Neogene. It is now well established, after\nvarious studies based on seismic reflection profiles, sidescan sonar and\nground truthing, that the whole area is under compressive deforma-\ntion. A number of active tectonic structures with high tsunamigenic\npotential were mapped (Terrinha et al., 2003; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b;\nZitellini et al., 2004) and various multilayered complexes of\n\nmailto:pedro.terrinha@ineti.pt\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2009.09.012\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00253227\n\n\nFig. 1.

Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156\u2013174\nhemipelagic-mass wasting deposits of Holocene and Pleistocene age\nwere imaged and dated (Vizcaino et al., 2006).\n\nThe morphology of the northeastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz was\ndescribed by Hernandez-Molina et al. (2003), Mulder et al. (2003) and\nSomoza et al. (2003). The morphology of the southern part of this\nsector is clearly influenced by the tectonomorphic processes associ-\nated with the deformation of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge\n(Maldonado et al., 1999; Gutscher et al., 2002), as well as gravitational\nprocesses (Gutscher et al., 2008), while in the northern part the\nshaping processes are sedimentary, erosive and tectonic, associated\nwith the MOW and to diapiric ridges.\n\nThe objective of this work is to describe the morphology of the\nnorthwestern part of the Gulf of Cadiz and discuss the morphogenetic\nprocesses in relation to the tectonic deformation of the Alpine colli-\nsion front and the Gloria transform fault. This is done based on the\ninterpretation of an original multibeam bathymetry data and seismic\nreflection profiles.\n\n1.2. Geological setting\n\nDuring Triassic through Early Cretaceous times the southern and\nwestern Iberian margins underwent tectonic rifting, which led to\noceanic break-up of the West Iberian Margin from Barremian to Aptian\ntimes (Pinheiro et al., 1996). Although the existence of oceanic litho-\nsphere in the Gulf of Cadiz is still a matter of debate (Srivastava et al.,\n1990; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Rovere et al., 2004), some authors\npostulated the existence of a south Iberia subduction zone that ac-\ncommodated the Africa\u2013Iberia convergence, from Late Cretaceous\u2013\nPaleogene through Miocene times (e.g. Srivastava et al., 1990). Ac-\ncordingly, this process led to the formation of back arc basins and\nassociated tectonic terranes in the western Mediterranean, the forma-\ntion of the Betic orogen, as well as to the tectonic inversion of the\nrifted autochthonous south Portuguese and south Spanish margins (e.g.\nTerrinha, 1998; Maldonado et al., 1999; Rosenbaum et al., 2002; Lopes\net al., 2006). Westward directed thrusting of the Internal Betics domains\nand orogenic collapse, possibly associated with roll back of the Africa\nsubducted slab, formed the Gibraltar orogenic arc, the Gulf of Cadiz\naccretionary wedge and lithospheric thinning in the Alboran Sea\n(Rosenbaum et al., 2002; Faccenna et al., 2004). These tectonic processes\nled to the formation of an accretionary wedge westward of the Gibraltar\narc (Gutscher et al., 2002) or imbricate wedge with a westward directed\ntectonic transport, and an associated distal olistostrome complex (e.g.,\nHorseshoe Gravitational Unit in Iribarren et al., 2007; Giant Chaotic\nBody in Torelli et al., 1997) that extends across the Horseshoe\nAbyssal Plain (Fig. 2). The MCS lines reveal a basal decollement\nhorizon of the stacked thrusts of the accretionary wedge near the top\nof the Cretaceous. Both the accretionary prism and the olistostrome\nare sealed by sediments of Late Miocene to Lower Pliocene age\n(Tortella et al., 1997; Torelli et al., 1997; Roque, 2007). The segment\nof the Azores\u2013Gibraltar Fracture Zone to the east of the Gloria Fault\n(inset in Fig. 1) was described by Sartori et al. (1994) as a diffuse\nplate tectonic boundary and various plate kinematic models indicate\na 4 mm/yr rate of NW\u2013SE to WNW\u2013ESE convergence between Nubia\nand Iberia along this fault (insets in Figs. 1 and 8), (Argus et al., 1989;\nDeMets et al., 1994; Sillard et al., 1998; Kreemer and Holt, 2001;\nSella et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2002; Calais et al., 2003; Fernandes et\nal., 2003; Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich et al., 2006). Ribeiro et al.\n(1996) postulated the formation of an incipient West Iberia\nsubduction zone during Pliocene\u2013Quaternary times, based on the\ncomputed NW\u2013SE present day main compression direction.\n\nN\u2013S to NE\u2013SW faults formed in the Permian during the late\nVariscan fracturing event (Arthaud and Matte, 1977; Ribeiro, 2002)\nand they were subsequently reactivated during the Mesozoic rifting,\nthe Mesozoic transient compressive episodes (Terrinha et al., 2002)\n\n\n\nFig. 2.

These faults were described as active in\nthe Quaternary by Zitellini et al. (1999), Zitellini et al. (2001), Gr\u00e0cia\net al. (2003a,b) and Terrinha et al. (2003). The uneven surface of the\nMarqu\u00eas de Pombal fault scarp is due to widespread slumping and\nlandslides with mass transport distances that exceed 20 km. The\nPereira de Sousa fault scarp is also heavily incised and the D. Henrique\nbasin shows a series of radial ridges that consist of turbidite levees\ntransported downslope from the highs that surround it (Terrinha\net al., 2003; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b).\n\nWSW\u2013ENE to W\u2013E trending Mesozoic rifting faults were inverted\nduring the latest Cretaceous through early Miocene times (Terrinha,\n1998; Lopes et al., 2006).\n\nDuarte et al. (2005) showed the existence of presently active\nWNW\u2013ESE trending faults in the Gulf of Cadiz and Medialdea (2007)\nproposed that these faults acted as transfer faults between the\nGorringe Bank and the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault across the\nHorseshoe fault. Onshore southwest Portugal, WNW\u2013ESE trending\nLower Jurassic extensional faults were described by Ribeiro and\nTerrinha (2007). Zitellini et al. (2009) proposed the existence of a\nNubia\u2013Eurasia plate boundary based on a set of 600 km long WNW\u2013\nESE trending set of strike-slip faults that cut across the Horseshoe\nAbyssal Plain and Gulf of Cadiz connecting the Gloria Fault and the\nTell tectonic zone onshore north-west Morocco.\nEarthquake frequency and epicentre location (Fig. 2) show that\nSW Iberia is an area of moderate seismicity which accommodates the\nbrittle deformation associated with the Nubia\u2013Iberia collision west of\nGibraltar, by means of thrusting and strike-slip events of shallow and\nintermediate depth. However, the existence of historical and instru-\nmental high magnitude earthquakes such as the 1/11/1755 Lisbon\nearthquake (M=8.5 to 8.9) and the 28/2/1969 (Ms=7.9) event re-\nquire clarification of the present tectonic setting of the SW Iberia\u2013NW\nAfrica region, and identification of the structures that generate large\nmagnitude earthquakes and tsunami in this area. The Gorringe Bank\nFault is a north westwards directed thrust that sits at the northern\nbase of this morphologic feature. This thrust uplifted the seafloor from\napproximately ?5000 m to ?24 m, it reached its paroxysmal activity\nin Miocene times and has accommodated negligible shortening since\nthen (Sartori et al., 1994; Tortella et al., 1997). Although the Gorringe\nBank is by far the most conspicuous morphotectonic structure in the\nstudy area (Fig. 1), the distribution of seismicity (Fig. 2), numerical\nmodels for tsunami wave propagation (Baptista et al., 1998) and the\ninterpretation of MCS lines (Sartori et al., 1994), led various re-\nsearchers to abandon it as the source of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\n\nRecent models proposed the existence of two faults, the Marqu\u00eas\nde Pombal Fault and the Horseshoe fault (Terrinha et al., 2003; Gr\u00e0cia\net al., 2003a,b) (Fig. 2) or the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault and the\nGuadalquivir Bank fault (Baptista et al., 2003), acting together\nsimultaneously to generate the 1755 event by adding up their rupture\nareas (Terrinha et al., 2003; Baptista et al., 2003; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b).\nAlternatively, Gutscher et al. (2002) proposed that the 1755 Lisbon\n\n\n\n159P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156\u2013174\nearthquake was generated in the Gibraltar subduction zone imaged on\nseismic tomography, arguing that this was also the source of the deep\n1954 Granada earthquake.\n\n1.3. Data and methods\n\n38,000 km2 of multibeam swath bathymetry data were acquired in\nthe MATESPRO Survey with a hull-mounted Simrad EM 120 echo-\nsounder aboard the research vessel NRP D. Carlos I in 3 legs from 14 June\nto 7 July 2004 (Figs. 3 and 4). The survey was carried out in order\nto comply with a level 3 hydrographic survey as established by the\nInternational Hydrographic Organization. The EM 120 operates at a\nmain frequency of 12 kHz (from 11.25 to 12.6 kHz) with 191 beams\ncovering a 150\u00b0 fan with a width of 1\u00b0. In order to increase data quality\nthe angular value was reduced to 120\u00b0 and the ping width was of 2\u00b0. One\nsound velocity profile (SVP) was performed every 24 h and at locations\nchosen to spatially cover the entire area in order to compensate the\neffect of the Mediterranean Outflow Water on the sound velocity in the\nwater column regionally. SVP data were acquired down to 2000 m of\nwater depth. From ?2000 to ?4000 m sound velocity was taken from\nclimatologic profiles provided by the Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico of Portugal\nin this area. Quality control lines were also performed totalizing about\n10% of the area; the depth errors found were below 0.3% of the water\ndepth. Bathymetric data filtering and processing was carried using\nCARIS HIPS software and a 100 m grid was generated.\n\nThe positioning of the vessel was done with both GPS and DGPS\nmounted on different parts of the vessel in order to better deter-\nminate the position and make the yaw corrections; the errors asso-\nciated with the navigation positioning were around 5 m.\n\nThe seismic data presented here are of two types: multi-channel\nseismic (MCS) profiles from three previous surveys, ARRIFANO\n(acronym of Arco Rifano; Sartori et al., 1994), IAM (acronym of Iberian\nFig. 3.

As a result, the vertical reso-\nlution in the sedimentary section is of around 20 m for the IAM and\nARRIFANO profiles and of about 15 m for the VOLTAIRE data, assuming a\nmean seismic velocity of 2500 ms?1 in the sedimentary section (data\nfrom bore-holes in Fig. 3 and Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 1998). The central peak\nfrequency of the single-channel TTR profile is around 100 Hz with a\ncorresponding vertical resolution of about 6 m. Information on acquisi-\ntion and processing of these profiles is summarized in Table 1.\n\nThe presented seismostratigraphic interpretation was based on\nthe stratigraphy of five industry wells offshore the Algarve Basin\n(stars in Fig. 1, Lopes et al., 2006), as well as published data from the\noffshore Guadalquivir Basin (Maldonado et al., 1999).\n\n2.

This canyon is made up of two\nsegments oriented NE\u2013SW and N\u2013S that collect the sediment from the\ngullies that incise the shelf and slope (Figs. 4 and 5). Also note that\nthe flanks of the NE\u2013SW trending segment and the eastern flank\nof the N\u2013S trending segment display higher degree of incision,\nwhile the western flank of the N\u2013S trending segment and both\nflanks of the deepest part of the canyon are smoother. The close up\nin Fig. 6A shows a submarine landslide near the termination of the\ncanyon. The lack of the mass transport deposit within the canyon is\nan indication of the activity of the canyon in terms of sediment\nerosion and transport.\n\nThe 70 km long Portim\u00e3o canyon also has its head scarp in the\nshelf at roughly 70 mbsl. The canyon cuts across the shelf and slope\nsedimentary sequence with a maximum incision of 1 km. The canyon\nterminates abruptly at the meeting point with the Faro canyon and D.\nCarlos valley that drain east to west. These features have a different\nphysiography, with a flat and broad bottom capable of accommodat-\ning larger sediment influx. The Portim\u00e3o canyon is fairly rectilinear\nand sits along the Portim\u00e3o Fault (Terrinha et al., 1999).\n\nThe Aljezur and Lagos canyons only incise the continental slope.\nThe NNE\u2013SSW trending Aljezur canyon is short, rectilinear and drains\ninto the Sagres valley. The western flank of the Aljezur canyon\ndisplays a series of anastomosed submarine slide scars at approxi-\nmately 1300 mbsl, at a main morphologic break of the continental\nslope near the base of the Lagos contourite drift (Fig. 6B).\n\nThe Sagres valley collects the east to west draining D. Carlos and\nCadiz valleys and the Aljezur and Lagos canyons. The Aljezur canyon\nand Sagres valley lie on the southern prolongation of an important\nslope break that can be observed in the low resolution bathymetry\n(see Figs. 2, 4 and 5) and also on the southern continuation of the\nAljezur Fault that cuts across the Meso\u2013Cenozoic Algarve Basin and\nPaleozoic basement (Fig. 2).\nFig. 5. Interpretative sketch of the morphology of the study area\nThe Lagos canyon has its head scarp roughly at 800 mbsl, where it\nincises the Pliocene through Holocene Lagos contourite drift.\n\n2.1.2. East to west oriented sediment drainage system\nThe seafloor of the inner part of the Gulf of Cadiz dips to the west\n\ntowards the Atlantic Ocean. The seafloor is shaped by a variety of\nmorphological features of various scales, many of which have been\ndescribed by Mulder et al. (2003), Somoza et al. (2003), Hernandez-\nMolina et al. (2006), and Gutscher et al. (2008).\n\nThe most important E\u2013W trending valleys of the study area lie in the\nprolongation of the sinuous and broader E\u2013W channels that initiate on\nthe Gibraltar Arc owing to erosion and sedimentation by the MOW and\nto downslope gravity processes (Hernandez-Molina et al., 2003). In the\nstudy area these valleys are broad, with flat gently dipping bottom.\nThe Faro canyon and D. Carlos valley collect the sediment transport from\nthe South Portuguese margins, a large number of gullies, valleys and the\nPortim\u00e3o canyon. The D. Carlos valley changes from narrow channel to\nbroad valley downslope from the merge of the Portim\u00e3o Canyon.\n\nThe Cadiz valley lies between the Portim\u00e3o Bank and the wrinkled\nsurface of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge. The Sagres valley that\nlies in the prolongation of the Aljezur canyon establishes the connection\nbetween the drainage system located to the east of the Horseshoe Fault\nscarp and the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain. The Sagres valley displays a\ncorrugate bottom north of the confluence with the Cadiz valley; from\nthis point to the south it has a smooth surface and less dip. The flanks of\nthe Sagres valley display various evidences of gravity slumping (Fig. 6B).\n\nThe Horseshoe valley is a roughly rectangular area, 80 km\u00d750 km,\ndipping to the west (mean dip of ~0.5\u00b0), connecting the Gulf of Cadiz\nseafloorandthe HorseshoeAbyssalPlainacross theHorseshoe Faultscarp\n(Fig. 1). The valley is limited by the Sagres plateau in the north, the Coral\nPatch Ridge in the south and the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge in\nthe east.

Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156\u2013174\ndescribed elsewhere in this paper. This wide valley collects the mouths of\nwell developed canyons and valleys that drain the sediments from the\nnorth and eastern shelves. The drainage to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain is\npoorly developed (Fig. 5) and the Horseshoe fault scarp is being eroded in\nvarious segments showing evidences of landsliding (Fig. 6C). These\ndifferent styles and degrees of maturation of the sediment drainage\npattern suggest that this area acts simultaneously as a by-pass and\nreceptacle region for the sediments that are carried from the continental\nshelves to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain.\n\nDespite the general low slope of this area, there are NE\u2013SW trend-\ning scarps with a maximum height of approximately 150 m (Fig. 7).\nThe flat areas have maximum dips of 3\u00b0 and slope breaks in which\nformed convex upwards crescent shaped escarpments. The crescent\nshaped three-dimensional features measure up to 5 km across, are\nshown in detail in Fig. 7 to occur between 3900 and 4700 mbsl, have an\ninternal escarpment up to ~100 m high with an internal slope varying\nfrom 6\u00b0 to 27\u00b0.\n\n2.2. Plateaus and escarpments\n\nThe plateaus in the study area are the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal, Sagres\nand Portim\u00e3o plateaus (Figs. 1, 4 and 5). The Marqu\u00eas de Pombal\n\n\n\nFig. 7. Shaded relief image (perspective view) of the Giant Scours (GS), L1 and L2 WNW\u2013ESE trending lineaments (interpreted as strike-slip faults, max. total length 250 km, see\nFig. 11) and associated en echelon folds on sea floor recent sediments indicating dextral strike-slip movement component on the faults. Approximate depth 4000 m, confer with\nFigs. 1 and 4. Position of seismic lines in Figs. 11, 15 and 16 is also shown. Detail of the en echelon folds on L1 in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain is shown in Fig. 6E.\n\n163P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156\u2013174\nplateau is a roughly rectangular surface bound by the NNE\u2013SSW\ntrending Marqu\u00eas de Pombal reverse fault scarp in the west and by the\nS\u00e3o Vicente canyon in the east, as described by Gr\u00e0cia et al. (2003a,b).\n\nThe Sagres plateau has an approximately rectangular shape\ndivided by a diagonal NE\u2013SW trending crest. To the west, the Sagres\nplateau is bound by the Horseshoe reverse fault scarp and the S\u00e3o\nVicente canyon and by the Aljezur canyon and the Sagres Valley in the\neast. In the north this plateau is separated from the mid and upper\ncontinental slope and shelf by a rectilinear E\u2013W trending valley that\nlies in the prolongation of the D. Carlos valley.\n\nThe Horseshoe fault scarp is only well developed on its northern\nsegment. The southern part is being eroded (Fig. 6C) by the sediment\ndrainage system described previously.\n\nThe southern part of the Sagres plateau dips gently towards the\nHorseshoe valley. This surface dips approximately 1.5\u00b0, is very uneven,\nand has a wavy appearance comprising undulations that vary from\nhundreds of meters to more than 10 km in length, and 0.5 km to 5 km\nacross (Figs. 4 and 5).\n\nThe Portim\u00e3o plateau is an E\u2013W elongated surface limited by the\ntwo prominent escarpments which constitute flanks of the D. Carlos\nand Cadiz valleys. The northern escarpment is sinuous, while the\nsouthern one, is fairly rectilinear, trending WNW\u2013ESE, draped by\nrecent sediments carried by the local drainage. The top of this plateau\nshows circular positive reliefs, the larger one of which has been\nlabeled here as the D. Carlos salt diapir (Figs. 1, 4 and 6D), whose\norigin is discussed elsewhere in this paper.\n\n2.3. The Horseshoe Abyssal Plain\n\nThe extremely flat HAP has general slopes of less than 0.1\u00b0 sharply\ncontrasting with the slopes of the foot of its boundaries, between 5\u00b0\nand 10\u00b0 in general.\nThe foot of the slope of the Gorringe Bank presents a remarkable\noffset of about 14 km at roughly 11\u00b0W (Fig. 4). This offset lies at the\nend of a valley that originates at the Gorringe saddle (see Fig. 1 for\nlocation). It is also clear that the southern flanks of the Gettysburg and\nOrmonde seamounts display fairly different topographic roughness.\nThe Ormonde southern flank smooth topography resembles the\nmorphological types of the continental slope or of the Sagres plateau,\nwhile the edges of the Gettysburg and Coral Patch Ridge display a\nsimilar wrinkled surface. It is possible that this offset and valley coin-\ncide with the ocean\u2013continent boundary proposed by Rovere et al.\n(2004) at the Gorringe Bank.\n\nThe interior of the HAP is only locally perturbed by four elongated\ngroups of hills that rise between 40 m and 200 m above seafloor\n(Fig. 4 and 6E). The largest of these groups is 16 km in length and the\nlargest individual hill is 6 km long. The hills in each group are aligned\nalong approximately E\u2013W directions and each one of the hills has\ntheir crest parallel to NE\u2013SW, approximately. These hills are aligned\nalong the WNW\u2013ESE oriented tectonic morphological lineaments\ndescribed and discussed elsewhere in this paper.\n\n2.4. Lineaments\n\nLong WNW\u2013ESE trending discrete lineaments of tectonic origin\nwere for the first time revealed in the Gulf of Cadiz sea floor by the\nMATESPRO multibeam survey (Duarte et al., 2005 and Rosas et al.,\n2009). These lineaments consist of an aligned series of elongate\nWNW\u2013ESE trending crests and troughs, more or less continuous, with\na typical width of a few hundreds of meters (Figs. 4 and 7). Pervasive\nsets of E\u2013W linear undulations, up to 8 km long, accompany these\nlineaments (Fig. 7).

Altogether, from the Gorringe Bank\nflank across the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and lower continental slope\nof the Gulf of Cadiz, lineaments of 250 km can be identified, from\napproximately 4870 to 2000 mbsl (Fig. 4). It is worthwhile to note\nthat various mud volcanoes sit on top of the lineaments (Figs. 2 and 4).\n\n3. Structure of the NW part of the Gulf of Cadiz\n\nA structural map of the study area based on the interpretation of\nthe MATESPRO bathymetry and available MCS profiles is presented in\nFig. 8. The main faults are here described based on MCS profiles that\nare quoted from published works or presented here. Fig. 8 also shows\na compilation of focal mechanisms and main horizontal compression\ntaken from Ribeiro et al. (1996).\n\n3.1. WNW\u2013ESE to E\u2013W Faults\n\nOne of the most prominent features in the north-western part of\nthe Gulf of Cadiz is the above described WNW\u2013ESE to E\u2013W trending\nset of valleys, escarpments and lineaments (Figs. 4 and 7). The seismic\nlines that are shown in Figs. 9\u201311 and hereafter described show that\nFig. 8.

Carlos and Cadiz valleys that bound the Portim\u00e3o plateau sit\non top on two faults, as shown in Fig. 9. According to this the Portim\u00e3o\nplateau can be interpreted as a pop-up structure. The D. Carlos valley lies\nat the south-western edge of the Guadalquivir acoustic basement high\nthat, at the precise location of this seismic profile, bears a WNW\u2013ESE\nstrike as can be seen on the bathymetry (Fig. 4). The drag evident in the\nsediments of the uppermost sequence and the superficial gravity ex-\ntensional faults indicate that the northernmost valley flank fault is\nundergoing extensional deformation at Present. The folds in the\nMesozoic through Miocene\u2013Lower Pliocene of the central and northern\nparts of the Portim\u00e3o pop-up depict an asymmetry that indicates\nnorthwards tectonic transport on top of the acoustic basement fault.\n\nSince it has been known for long that the Guadalquivir Bank is\nmade up of Variscan basement metamorphosed flysch of Carbonifer-\nous age (e.g. Ribeiro et al., 1979; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b) the stratigraphy\nacross the northern fault of the Faro valley implies that it played an\nextensional role during the Mesozoic followed by northwards directed\nthrusting during the Paleogene through Miocene and resumed\nextensional movement during Pliocene\u2013Quaternary times.\nmechanisms.

C) Plate kinematic data taken from various indicated sources indicated in the text.\n\n\n\nFig. 9. Multi-channel seismic line VOLTAIRE 3 and line drawing interpretation. The Guadalquivir basement high of Carboniferous age is bound by a NW\u2013SE trending Mesozoic\nextensional fault, reactivated as a reverse fault (1st movement) that resumed its extensional movement in late Miocene through Present times (see text for discussion, for location of\nline see Fig. 1). The topographic bulge on top of the strike-slip fault is imaged in 3D in Fig. 6F.\n\n165P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156\u2013174\nThe southern boundary of the Portim\u00e3o pop-up block shows both the\ntopography and the Mesozoic through Quaternary sedimentary\npackages dipping to the south (Fig. 9). The following features are also\nevident in the seismic line across the southern part of Portim\u00e3o plateau\n(Fig. 9), as follows: i) tectonic deformation affects the topmost sedi-\nments (Fig. 6F), ii) the pre-Pliocene folds asymmetry is southwards\nverging, iii) there is no correspondence on the seismic stratigraphy\nbetween the pre-Pliocene sediments of the Portim\u00e3o pop-up and the\nsouthern counterpart and iv) the Mesozoic units show a wedge geo-\nmetry. From these observations it is inferred that, firstly, this boundary of\nthe Portim\u00e3o plateau is an old fault with opposite dip with respect to the\nnorth boundary of the plateau, secondly, this was a northerly dipping\nextensional fault during the Mesozoic, thirdly, it was inverted with a\nsouthwards directed tectonic transport during the Paleogene through\nMiocene times and, fourthly it is going tectonic deformation at Present.\n\nThe southernmost segment of the seismic profile in Fig. 9 cuts\nacross the Cadiz valley and up slope the gently dipping north western\npart of the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge. The profile shows a sub-\nhorizontal, mildly deformed sequence of sediments covering the\nchaotic seismic facies of the accretionary wedge or imbricate thrust\nwedge, as described by Gutscher et al. (2002) and Iribarren et al.\n(2007), respectively. The base of the chaotic seismic facies unit is\nmade up by coherent high amplitude reflectors here interpreted as\nJurassic through Cretaceous syn-rift sediments on top of which de-\ntached the thrust wedge. It is worthwhile to note that these sediments\nare disrupted by vertical discontinuities, with small vertical displace-\nment, that can be followed up into the chaotic body and overlying\ntopmost sequence.\n\nThe sub-vertical discontinuity that separates the Portim\u00e3o plateau\nfrom the southern plain is neither compatible with thrusting nor\nwith extensional tectonics (Fig. 9). Alternatively, it is interpreted as a\ntranspressive E\u2013W trending strike-slip fault at Present based on the\nfact that it displays evidence of shortening structures, folds and north\nwards and south wards directed thrusts on both sides of the fault.\nThese observations imply that the main compression direction rotated\nfrom high angle to low angle with respect to the E\u2013W strike of the\nfaults, which is compatible with the counter-clockwise rotation of the\nmovement of Africa with respect to Iberia in the Cenozoic, from\napproximately south to north in the Paleogene, to south east to north\nwest in the Miocene to ESE to WNW in the Present (Dewey et al.,\n1989).\n\nThe circular dome protruding the top of the Portim\u00e3o plateau\ndepicted in the bathymetry is interpreted as D. Carlos salt diapir\n(Figs. 1, 4 and 10). The salt does not outcrop at the surface but is\npopping-up underneath the sedimentary cover. The two reverse faults\nthat bound this structure were interpreted as smaller scale structures\naccommodating internal shortening across the Guadalquivir Bank by\nZitellini et al. (2004). This is a clear example where the map view\nimage clarifies specific not fully understood superficial structures in\nreflection seismics.\n\nThe deep structure of the WNW\u2013ESE trending lineaments (Fig. 8)\nis imaged in the seismic profiles shown in Figs. 9, 10 and 11 in the\nwork of Rosas et al. (2009). It can be seen in these seismic profiles that\nthe rectilinear morphologic lineaments overlie vertical discontinuities\nthat are rooted far below the accretionary wedge detachment, i.e. into\nthe Jurassic sediments. These discontinuities cut the Mesozoic into\nblocks of 3\u20135 km of width, with small vertical offset and stratigraphic\nmismatch. The symmetry of the upward drag of the seismic horizons\nwith respect to these discontinuities from the deepest stratigraphic\nlevels across the chaotic facies, the disturbance observed in the cover\n\n\n\nFig. 10.

For location of seismic line see Fig. 3. The D. Carlos salt diapir 3D topography is shown in Fig. 6D.\n\n166 P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156\u2013174\nsediments and the existence of mud volcanoes sitting on top of these\nlineaments (Figs. 8 and 12), strongly argues in favour of upward\ninjection of fluids along these faults (cf. with Figs. 9 and 11). These\ncharacteristics strongly suggest that these discontinuities can corre-\nspond to tensile fractures with a strike-slip movement component.\n\nThe pervasive set of E\u2013W trending undulations that accompany the\nE\u2013W to WNW\u2013ESE trending faults are en echelon folds (Figs. 7 and 11),\ni.e. kinematic indicators that show a dextral strike-slip lateral move-\nment on these faults.\n\nThe growth wedge of Mesozoic sediments clearly associated to\nsome of these WNW\u2013ESE trending faults (Fig. 10) is another indi-\ncation for the deep root of these faults.\n\n3.2. N\u2013S to NE\u2013SW faults\n\nThe Aljezur canyon\u2013Sagres valley and the Portim\u00e3o canyon sit on\ntop of the offshore prolongation of the Aljezur and Portim\u00e3o faults,\nrespectively (Figs. 2 and 8). Inspection of the seismic profiles con-\nfirms the Pliocene\u2013Quaternary activity of these faults that show an\nimportant decrease in tectonic deformation after Miocene times\n(Figs. 12 and 13). The offshore mapping of these faults shows they\nhave continuous segments larger than 100 km in length that, when\nadded together with the onshore segments, they constitute discon-\ntinuous steep faults of approximately 200 km long, as happens with\nthe left-lateral strike-slip late Variscan faults in the central and\nnorthern parts of the Iberian peninsula (Arthaud and Matte, 1977;\nRibeiro, 2002), which are also active in the Quaternary (Cabral,\n1989).\n\nThe Tagus Abyssal Plain Fault is proposed on the basis of the N\u2013S\ntrending sharp morphological scarp that lies to the north of the\nGorringe Bank thrust. However, recent unpublished work by Cunha\n(2008) confirms the existence of this reverse fault that cross cuts\nPliocene\u2013Quaternary sediments.\n\nThe S\u00e3o Vicente Fault strikes NE\u2013SW (Fig. 14) outcrops along the\nsoutheast flank of the S\u00e3o Vicente canyon. It is a southeastwards\ndipping steep fault, possibly part of the Odemira\u2013\u00c1vila fault (also\nknown as the Messejana dyke), an approximately 600 km long\nvertical left-lateral late Variscan fault intruded by a basic dyke of\nEarly Jurassic age (Dunn et al., 1998). Pliocene\u2013Quaternary vertical\ndisplacement along this fault onshore was described by Cabral (1995).\n\nThe NE\u2013SW trending Horseshoe fault was described as an active\nfault in the Present by Gr\u00e0cia et al. (2003a,b) and Zitellini et al. (2004),\nand has a cluster of seismicity associated to it (Figs. 1 and 2). Its fault\nscarp is very well depicted in the MATESPRO bathymetry, from the\nCoral Patch Ridge well into the South Portuguese continental slope\nbordering the Sagres plateau. It can be seen that the height of the\nscarp increases northwards and it is intercepted by WNW\u2013ESE\ntrending faults. At these interceptions the Horseshoe fault scarp is\neither deflected or offset across the WNW\u2013ESE dextral strike-slip\nfaults and landslides formed (Figs. 4, 5, 6C and 8).\n\n\n\nFig. 11.

However, this sedimentary cover is\ndeformed by the E\u2013W to WNW\u2013ESE dextral strike-slip faults and by\ndiscrete reactivation of individual thrusts of the stacked thrusts units,\nas described elsewhere in this work, as well as, by widespread extru-\nsion of mud volcanism, gravitational faulting described by various\nauthors as mentioned before.\n\nA unit of chaotic facies that has neither coherent internal layer-\ning nor imbricate fabrics, probably an olistostrome, is shown in\nFig. 10.

This olistostrome lies between the Portim\u00e3o\nBank and the wrinkled surface of the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary\nWedge, in the Cadiz valley.

The escarpments and seamounts\nIt was shown in this paper that the E\u2013W trending Portim\u00e3o Bank\n\nformed initially as a graben during Mesozoic times, was subsequently\ninverted during the Paleogene and Miocene compression and is now,\nprobably since Early Pliocene times, undergoing dextral transpressive\nstrike-slip deformation along its southern boundary, while the\nnorthern boundary experiences local extension due to a releasing\nbend formed by the basement fault. Seismicity and focal mechanisms\n(Fig. 2) attest for the compression at the southern edge of this sea-\nmount, preferentially concentrated to the east of the study area where\nthe fault becomes NE\u2013SW trending, i.e. at a higher angle to the main\nNW\u2013SE oriented compression direction.\n\nThe Sagres plateau is bound by the NE\u2013SW trending Horseshoe\nthrust of Miocene age in the west (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b, Zitellini et al.,\n2004) and the steeply dipping Aljezur fault in the east.

The cluster of instrumental seismicity in Fig. 2 attests for its\npresent day activity (Stich et al., 2007).\n\nThe Marqu\u00eas de Pombal plateau also resulted from tectonic\ninversion of an N\u2013S trending continent-wards directed extensional\nfault. The Pereira de Sousa fault is a N\u2013S trending steep Mesozoic rift\nfault still in activity at Present (Terrinha et al., 2003; Gr\u00e0cia et al.,\n2003a,b).\nFig. 16.

For location see Figs. 3 and 7.\nThe north westwards directed Gorringe Bank thrust with a paro-\nxysmal activity in the Tortonian (after Tortella et al., 1997; Sartori\net al., 1994) is still an active structure as attested by the instrumental\nseismicity cluster (Fig. 2).\n\nIt can be concluded that the escarpments, seamounts and uplifted\nplateaus of the study area, all formed in association with compressive\ntectonic events and resulted from polyphase tectonics. The Pereira de\nSousa fault escarpment is the only one that owes its morphology\nmostly to the Mesozoic rifting.\nn. Note the erosive character of the escarpments and the sediments prograding towards\n\n\n\n170 P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156\u2013174\nThe tectonic shaping processes are still active in the Present, as\nshown by the on-going formation of very recent features that are\nindicative of uplift and tectonic instability, such as the popping-up of\nthe D. Carlos salt diapir (Fig. 10), the mass wasting processes, such as\nsubmarine slides and various manifestations of soft sediment defor-\nmation and mass wasting processes in the Sagres plateau\u2013Aljezur\ncanyon, the S\u00e3o Vicente canyon and the Portim\u00e3o plateau, Horseshoe\nFaul scarp, as well as, on the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal, Gorringe and Pereira\nde Sousa escarpments as described by Gr\u00e0cia et al. (2003a,b), Terrinha\net al. (2003) and Vizcaino et al. (2006).\n\n4.1.2. The Giant Scours\nThe Giant Scours are crescent shaped depressions with scarps that\n\ncan reach more than 100 m high and slopes up to 27\u00b0 located in a relative\nflat area of the Horseshoe Valley that collects the sediments from the\nNorthern and North-eastern parts of the Gulf of Cadiz (Figs. 4, 5 and 7).\nThe scours sit on the edge of folds draping Pliocene to Quaternary\nthrusting and the frontal depressions are filed up with upslope pro-\ngradational bodies (Figs. 15 and 16). These bodies can be interpreted as\nbeen fed by material withdrawn from the retreating scarps (Fig. 17;\nDuarte et al., 2007). This scenario requires the existence of continuous\nscouring and sedimentation at unusual depths by means of bottom\ncurrents, possibly of turbidite origin as documented offshore the\nShetland Islands and Monterrey East Channel (Kenyon et al., 2000;\nKenyon et al., 2006; Fildani et al., 2006). The interaction of bottom and\nturbidity currents with seafloor morphological features formed by\nRecent tectonic activity can lead to flux separation and formation of\nvortexes that cause seafloor erosion and the formation of scours. These\nprocesses were proposed for the formation of similar structures in other\nplaces and different geological settings between 600 m and 3500 m\nwater depth (Faug\u00e8res et al., 1997; Bulat and Long, 2001; Verdicchio and\nTrincardi, 2006; Fildani et al., 2006). This process could account\nsimultaneously for the formation of the scarp of the scour, the pro-\ngradational bodies and the maintenance of the scarp, at least as long as\nthe bottom current lasted and the retreating escarpment does not meet\nan obstacle.\n\nAn alternative model is that the Giant Scours could form due to the\ninteraction of along slope bottom currents with the sea floor, such as\nthe North Atlantic Deep Water. This interaction could lead to the\nformation of giant eddies that could locally erode and amplify pre-\nexisting tectonic escarpments. However, the existence of along slope\ncurrents at these depths has not been documented in this area.\n\nEvidences for alternative mechanisms for the formation of these\nfeatures, such as slide\u2013slump processes caused by slope instabilities or\ncollapse processes associated with fluid escape along major tectonic\nstructures (similar to those of pockmark formation), were not\nobserved on the present dataset despite the evidences for mass\nwasting processes, and the existence of widespread mud volcanism\nand fluid migration activity in other areas of the Gulf of Cadiz.\n\n4.1.3. The canyons\nThe S\u00e3o Vicente and Portim\u00e3o canyons are by far the deepest\n\nincisions on the northern margin of the Gulf of Cadiz and they are\nunderlain and controlled by important steep faults. The Aljezur\nFig. 17. Sketch of the effect of bottom currents on the retreat of the scarp and simul-\ntaneous progressive sedimentation of the progradation foresets. Scarp initially formed\nby uplift of hanging-wall on top of a blind thrust (see text for discussion).\ncanyon\u2013Sagres valley system is also controlled by a steep fault. These\noffshore faults connect with others that were inherited from the late\nVariscan fracturing, subsequently reactivated during the Mesozoic\nrifting and Cenozoic tectonic inversion (see Fig. 2).\n\nThe MCS profiles shown in this work attest for the Quaternary\nactivity of these faults but also show that the deformation after\nMiocene times has severely diminished in the case of the Portim\u00e3o\nand Aljezur faults.\n\nGr\u00e0cia et al. (2003a,b) and Zitellini et al. (2004) showed the\nimportant activity of the northern segment of the Horseshoe fault that\nconstitutes the eastern flank of the terminal part of the S\u00e3o Vicente\ncanyon.\n\nThe S\u00e3o Vicente and Portim\u00e3o canyons show important gravity\nslides on their western flanks. This can be interpreted as caused by the\nincrease of the tilting associated with the west wards directed\nthrusting of the Marqu\u00eas de Pombal and Horseshoe faults. Alterna-\ntively, in the Sagres valley the sliding can be caused by excavation at\nthe meeting point of this valley with the Cadiz valley.\n\nThe minor present day tectonic deformation on the faults that\ncontrol the localization of the canyons together with the important\nincision and land sliding close to the active Marqu\u00eas de Pombal and\nHorseshoe thrusts can be interpreted as an indication of passive uplift\nof the continental slope carried on top of these thrusts.\n\n4.1.4. The chaotic bodies\nThree bodies of chaotic facies were distinguished in this work, all\n\ncovered by unit hemipelagic sediments usually of 0.3\u20130.5 sec TWT.\nOne is referred to as the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW) by\nGutscher et al. (2002) or alternatively as the Gulf of Cadiz Imbricate\nWedge by Iribarren et al. (2007). This body has a strong morphologic\nimprint on the seafloor morphology (Fig. 12).\n\nA second one, that extends across the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and\nHorseshoe Valley, has been considered as a gravitational unit, an\nolistostrome (e.g. Torelli et al., 1997; Iribarren et al., 2007). It is shown\nin this paper that this unit (Figs. 12 and 15) has imbricate seismic\nreflections that are interpreted as stacked thrusts, some of which have\nbeen recently reactivated forming blind thrusts morphologic scarps\nwhere the Giant Scours nucleated. These recent scarps are, however,\nthe only morphologic manifestation on the seafloor surface of this\nbody.\n\nA third body with internal non-organized chaotic facies overlies\nthe first described one, as shown in Fig. 10.\n\nIt is shown in this work that the two first described bodies consist\nof complexes of stacked thrusts and that the GCAW overthrusts the\nsecond one to the west (Fig. 10). Considering that these are tectono-\nstratigraphic units we speculate that only one accretionary wedge\n(or imbricate wedge) formed during the latest Cretaceous and Paleogene\n(perhaps through the Early Miocene). This event occurred before the\nGibraltar arc formed (when the Internal Betic terranes were still a long\nway farther east, Fig. 18B). Then, from Early Miocene to earliest Pliocene\n(or Messinian?) times, when the Gibraltar orogenic arc formed, a part of\nthis accretionary wedge was tectonically reworked forming the present\nday GCAW and its wrinkled topography (Fig. 18C). From the Pliocene to\nPresent the thrust stacking within the GCAW severely diminished and\nthe WNW\u2013ESE dextral strike-slip faults formed (Fig. 18 D).\n\nFrom a genetic point of view we consider the first two chaotic\nbodies as tectonic melanges made up of tectonised olistostromes and\ntectonosomes (see Camerlenghi and Pini, 2009 for discussion). The\nthird chaotic body is a non tectonised olistostrome.\n\n4.1.5. The WNW\u2013ESE lineaments, strike-slip faults and recent folding\nThe WNW\u2013ESE lineaments shown by the MATESPRO bathymetry\n\nin this paper (Fig. 7) display a series of en echelon folds materialized on\nthe most recent seafloor soft sediments that indicate strain accumu-\nlation by means of dextral strike-slip (Figs. 3 and 6). Rosas et al. (2009)\nusing quantitative strain analysis, analogue modelling and MCS data\n\n\n\nFig. 18. Schematic tectonic evolution of the structure of the Gulf of Cadiz. In this simplified interpretation it is proposed the formation of an accretionary wedge (or thrust belt) that extended\nfrom Gibraltar across theHorseshoe Abyssal Plain during the latest Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene compression. A secondaccretionary wedgeformed (after Gutscher et al., 2002, or imbricate unit after\nIribarren et al., 2007) during the Gibraltar orogenic arc westward overthrusting in Miocene times. In Pliocene\u2013Quaternary times this accretionary wedge severely diminished its activity, the\nWNW\u2013ESE dextral strike-slip faults formed and westward directed thrust increased along faults on the southern part of the West Portuguese Margin. See text for detailed discussion.\n\n171P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156\u2013174\nshowed that these en echelon folds result from Quaternary reactiva-\ntion of basement faults.\n\nInspection of MCS profiles in this paper show that these WNW\u2013ESE\nfaults are deeply rooted into the Jurassic\u2013Cretaceous rift sequences,\nwhich is compatible to observations made onshore in the Algarve Basin\nat the Lower Jurassic of the S. Vicente cape (Ribeiro and Terrinha, 2007).\n\nThese faults also serve as conduits for the exhalation of fluidized\nsediments that form some of the Gulf of Cadiz mud volcanoes (Fig. 2),\nwhich is another evidence of the recent activity of the faults and also\nthat they cut through the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary prism. Moreover,\nas shown on the MCS profile in Figs. 11 and 12, these strike-slip faults\nallow the escape of fluids from within deep in the Mesozoic sequences,\nprobably at the Hettangian stratigraphic level that hosts the salt in\nsouth Portugal and northwest Morocco (Terrinha, 1998).\n\nThe strike-slip faults and folding are also active in the Horseshoe\nAbyssal Plain. However, the scarce morphotectonic features associat-\ned to these faults in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain when compared to\nthe continental slope to the east, suggests a westwards propagation of\nthe recent deformation on the WNW\u2013ESE faults, away from the\nGibraltar Arc.\n\nBecause i) these faults have only recently been reactivated as strike-\nslip faults, ii) they strike at only a small angle to the present day\ntrajectory of Africa with respect to Iberia, according to recently reported\ngeodetic models (Fig. 8), iii) their minimum length exceeds 230 km as\nshown in the presented bathymetry and iv) they cut across the\nHorseshoe Abyssal Plain and the Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge; it is\nhere suggested that they will play an important tectonic role in the new\ntectonic framework that is presently under development between Iberia\nand Nubia. As a matter of fact, some of the WNW\u2013ESE faults described\nhere are located within a 600 km\u00d740 km shear zone proposed by\nZitellini et al. (2009) as a segment of the Eurasia\u2013Nubia plate boundary\nthat spans from the eastern tip of the Gloria Fault to the Rif\u2013Tell plate\nboundary in north-western Morocco (Morel and Megrhraoui, 1996).\n\n4.2. Strain partitioning, deformation migration and seismicity\n\nThe studied dataset shows that the E\u2013W trending faults were\ninherited from the Jurassic\u2013Lower Cretaceous rifting and subsequently\ninverted as reverse faults duringthe Cenozoic (Fig. 8); thesame applies to\nthe NE\u2013SW to N\u2013S trending faults as shown in previous works (Terrinha,\n1998; Terrinha et al., 2002; Terrinha et al., 2003; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a;\nRovere et al., 2004; Ribeiro and Terrinha, 2007). It was also shown that\nthe Gulf of Cadiz accretionary wedge has diminished significantly its\nactivity since latest Miocene times, possibly Early Pliocene, although\ndisperse thrusts that still remain blind underneath the Messinian\u2013Recent\nsediments are presently reactivated (Figs. 12 and 15).\n\nBased on the presented dataset, we propose that the present day\nWNW\u2013ESE convergent movement of Africa with respect to Iberia\ngenerates deformation in the study area, which is accommodated\nthrough partitioning on two approximately orthogonal fault sets, as\nfollows. An N\u2013S to NE\u2013SW striking set of faults that accommodate\nshortening mainly by thrusting and an E\u2013W to WNW\u2013ESE striking,\ngenerally sub-vertical, set of faults that accommodate dextral strike-\nslip faulting.\n\nThe first set comprehends the main thrust faults of the area,\nHorseshoe Fault, Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault and Tagus Abyssal Plain\n\n\n\n172 P. Terrinha et al. / Marine Geology 267 (2009) 156\u2013174\nfault (see map of Fig. 2) that extend the Present east to west short-\nening for approximately 300 km from the South, near the contact with\nthe Coral Patch Ridge (35.5\u00b0N), towards the north, along the West\nPortuguese Margin until a latitude of 38\u00b0N, as recently shown by\nNeves et al. (2009).\n\nThe second fault set is deeply rooted in Jurassic through Cretaceous\nrifting faults and were reactivated mainly in the Pliocene\u2013Quaternary as\ndextral strike-slip faults, which is compatible with the present day\nmovement of Nubia with respect to Iberia. These faults show consid-\nerably higher degree of deformation in the east than in the west, which\nargues in favour of propagation of deformation from east to west.\n\nThe thrusting on the N\u2013S Marqu\u00eas de Pombal fault is recent, as well as,\non the Gorringe Bank fault (that had a quiescence period after the\nTortonian), on the Tagus Abyssal Plain Fault (Cunha, 2008) and at the N\u2013S\ntrending faults at 38\u00b0N (Neves et al., 2009). Altogether, these observations\nlead us to argue that the deformation is migrating from the realm of\nGibraltar to the west and along the Portuguese West Margin to the north.\n\nConsidering the sub-parallel strike of the N\u2013S to NE\u2013SW faults, their\ncommon origin in the Permian and reactivation during the Mesozoic\nrifting and Cenozoic inversion, it is here suggested that this 300 km en\nechelon fault zone can have a common detachment, underneath SW\nIberia. Since the tomography data presented in Gutscher et al. (2002)\nsuggest that the Horseshoe may penetrate at least till 100 km in the\nlithosphere, the 300 km long N\u2013S trending fault system should be\nconsidered as firstly, a possible source candidate for the Lisbon 1/11/\n1755 earthquake and secondly, the propagation of a new front of\ncompressive deformation towards the north along the West Portuguese\nMargin, which will eventually lead to the nucleation of a West Iberia\nincipient subduction zone, as proposed by Ribeiro et al. (1996).\n\nAlternatively, even if these faults do not have a common detach-\nment, a complex rupture scenario can be envisaged to explain the large\nenergy released during the 1755 event. Complex seismic ruptures have\nbeen documented in other locations, such as, for instance the 1958\nGobi-Altay event which produced 260 km of surface rupture from the\nsegmented main fault with a strike-slip movement and simultaneous\nrupture of nearby thrust faults (Kurushin et al., 1997), or the Tangshan\nearthquake of 1976, which was a combination of several ruptures,\nstrike-slip and thrust faults, following each other only a few tens of\nseconds (Butler et al., 1979). The hypothesis of complex ruptures\ninvolving triggering or \u201cdomino-effect\u201d is consistent with the majority\nof the historical documents that report a very long vibration (up to\n20\u201330 min) and various sub-events for the 1st November 1755\nearthquake (e.g. Martinez-Solares, 2001).\n\nWe alsospeculate thatthe location of recentepicentres in front ofthe\nHorseshoe fault in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain, such as the 1969 event\n(Ms=7.9) (Fukao, 1973), as well as the Mw=6.0 12/02/2007 and the\nML=4.5 21/06/2006 events (Stich et al., 2007), all with a major dip-slip\ncomponent can be interpreted as an indication of nucleation of new\nthrusts to the west of the main Horseshoe fault.\n\nThe NW\u2013SE SHmax direction calculated from earthquake focal\nmechanism is in very good agreement with the Eurasia\u2013Africa con-\nvergence direction estimated by the NUVEL-1 model (DeMets et al.,\n1994). However, recent estimates of this velocity using space geodetic\ntechniques, andconsideringtheAfrica plate split into Nubia and Somalia,\ngive for the Nubia\u2013Eurasia collision a WNW\u2013ESE direction, in the middle\nof theGulf of Cadiz (Fig. 8). This discrepancy is interpreted asthecoupled\nresult of strain partitioning on E\u2013W and NNE\u2013SSW trending faults and\naseismic deformation along the plate boundary.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe following conclusions are drawn.\n\n1. The escarpments, seamounts and uplifted plateaus of the study area,\nall formed in association with polyphase compressive tectonic events\nfrom the late Cretaceous through Present, with the exception of the\nPereira de Sousa fault escarpment that owes most of its morphology\nto the Mesozoic rifting. The Quaternary uplift has generated mass\ntransport deposits (also reported by Gr\u00e0cia et al. (2003a,b), Terrinha\net al. (2003) and Vizcainoet al. (2006)), kilometric scale soft sediment\nunstable folds on the continental slope and incision of the canyons.\n\n2. The Giant Scours display erosive and depositional structures\nthat result from vortexes of high-density bottom currents at\nthe edge of scarps formed at the crest of blind thrusts anticlines\nof Recent age.\n\n3. The chaotic bodies buried under uppermost Miocene\u2013lower Pliocene\nsediments in the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain and Horseshoe Valley\ntogether with the GCAW formed as stacked thrusts (possibly an\naccretionary wedge) in the Late Cretaceous\u2013Earliest Miocene times\nbefore the emplacement of the Gibraltar orogenic Arc. Miocene\nreactivation of the eastern part of this body originated the GCAW and\nthrusting of this tectono-stratigraphic unit to the west. The third\nchaotic body corresponds to a non tectonised olistostrome that seals\nthe most important thrust stacking in early Pliocene times.\n\n4. The WNW\u2013ESE trending lineaments are the superficial expression\nof steep faults deeply rooted in the Mesozoic substratum and\nunderlying acoustic basement or Paleozoic basement onshore.\nSegments of these faults acted as rift faults during the Mesozoic\nand were reactivated in Quaternary times as strike-slip faults that\ncross cut the NE\u2013SW trending thrusts.\n\n5. The present day NW-wards movement of Nubia with respect to\nIberia generates strain partitioning by means of dextral wrenching\non WNW\u2013ESE trending steep faults and thrusting on the NE\u2013SW\ntrending fault in the Gulf of Cadiz and Horseshoe Abyssal Plain.\nFurther north, at the base of the continental slope of the south-\nernmost part of the West Iberia Margin, NNE\u2013SSW to N\u2013S west-\nerly dipping thrusts accommodate shortening in an area where\nwrenching has not been observed, which indicates that westward\ndirected thrusting propagated from the Gibraltar Arc to the west\n(Horseshoe Fault) and to the north along the Portuguese margin\n(Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault and Tagus Abyssal Plain Fault).\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work was sponsored by MATESPRO (PDCTM/P/MAR/15264/\n1999), EUROMARGINS SWIM (01-LEC-EMA09F), MVSEIS (01-LEC_\nEMA24F; PDCTM 72003/DIV/40018) and TOPOMED (TOPOEUROPE/\n0001/2007) projects and Instituto Scienze Marine (CNR) Bologna\ncontribution 1630.

Based\non this, we conclude that the study lineaments correspond to the bathymetric expression of ongoing dextral\nwrenching reactivation of WNW\u2013ESE pre-existing faults, and we estimate the age of this tectonic reactivation\nas being ca. 1.8 Ma (i.e. form late Pliocene to Present day). These characteristics agree with the most recent\nkinematic models derived from geodetic observations, indicating that Present day convergence between\nNubia and Iberia is subparallel to the newly identified lineaments and occurs at a 4 mm/yr rate.\n\n\u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nThe Gulf of Cadiz area, located West of the Gibraltar Strait, offshore\nSW Iberia and NW Morocco (Fig. 1), has been increasingly recognized\nas a critical site for the understanding of the tectonics related with the\nAfrica (Nubia)\u2013Iberia plate boundary (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994; Zitellini\net al., 1999; Maldonado et al., 1999; Gutscher et al., 2002; Gracia et al.,\n2003; Terrinha et al., 2003; Gutscher, 2004; Zitellini et al., 2001, 2004;\nMedialdea et al., 2004; Thiebot and Gutscher, 2006; Terrinha et al.,\nunder review). This boundary extends along the WNW\u2013ESE Azores\u2013\nGibraltar line, comprising to the West the Azores triple junction and\nthe Gloria fault, and to the East the Gulf of Cadiz domain (Fig. 1A). In\nthis domain, the average direction of the Maximum Horizontal\nCompressive Stresses (SHmax), deduced from earthquake focal\nmechanisms, is ~N45W (Ribeiro et al., 1996; Borges et al., 2001),\nmeanwhile recently reported geodetic models show the existence of\nWNW\u2013ESE oblique convergence between Nubia and Iberia, at a\nPresent day rate of approximately 4 mm/yr (e.g. Nocquet and Calais,\n+351 21 7500064.\n\nll rights reserved.\n2004; Stich et al., 2006; Fernandes et al., 2007, inset of Fig. 1B). Recent\nmapping of the main tectonic structures in the area (Fig. 1B) suggests\nthat compression is presently being dissipated in a complex manner,\nessentially through inter-plate brittle deformation, characterized by\nthe development of different structures with different orientations\nand kinematics. Previously reported earthquake recurrence data,\nepicentre location data, and focal mechanisms (Buforn et al., 1995,\n2004; Borges et al., 2001; Stich et al., 2005, 2006) point to a general\nscenario of moderate magnitude seismicity, mostly related to\nthrusting and strike-slip movement, along numerous faults at shallow\nto intermediate depths (above 60 km). This area is also prone to high\nmagnitude earthquakes and destructive tsunami like the 1/11/1755\nGreat Lisbon Earthquake (estimated magnitude between 8.5 and 8.8,\ne.g. Abe, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Mart\u00ednez-Solares and L\u00f3pez Arroyo,\n2004). Other large magnitude events, such as the 28/02/1969\nearthquake (Ms=7.9) occurring in the Gulf of Cadiz illustrate the\npractical need to improve our knowledge regarding the Present day\ntectonic evolution of this key region.\n\nIn this work we present new results concerning the study of\nseveral major bathymetric lineaments, recorded in recent seafloor\nsediments of the NW Gulf of Cadiz area. These features were firstly\nrecognized using the high-resolution multi-beam bathymetry\nrecently acquired during the MATESPRO campaign (MAjor TEctonic\nand Sedimentary PROcesses in the Portuguese Margins, Terrinha et al.,\n\nmailto:frosas@fc.ul.pt\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2008.08.002\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00253227\n\n\nFig. 1.

In addition, several analogue model-\nling experiments were carried out to get new insight on their origin,\nkinematic evolution and tectonic meaning. This was done through\ncomparison of the obtained experimental results with the correspon-\ndent natural examples, which showed that some morphotectonic\npatterns associated to the lineaments could be used in a quantitative\nmanner, as natural strain gauges, allowing a better understanding of\nthe main tectonic processes at stake.\n\n2. Morphotectonic characterization of the study objects\n\n2.1. Morphologic description\n\nThe new MATESPRO bathymetry dataset obtained in NW Gulf of\nCadiz revealed a complex geomorphology, interpreted as the result of\nthe combined action of different processes such as tectonics,\nsedimentation, gravity, and submarine erosion (Terrinha et al.,\nunder review). These data allowed, for the first time, the identification\nof several major bathymetric lineaments (L1 to L4 in Fig. 2). These\nlinear features strike approximately WNW\u2013ESE, exhibiting widths of a\nfew kilometres (typically 1.5 km to 3 km), and maximum bathymetric\nlengths of ca. 100 km. L1 is best characterized by sets of discontinuous\noblique (W\u2013E) morphologic undulations, consisting in alternating\ncrest and troughs up to 6 km long, displaying a general en-\u00e9chelon\ngeometrical disposition (Fig. 3A,B and C); L2 exhibits an overall more\ncontinuous morphology, characterized by two main wide elevated\nareas, elongated along strike, and located on opposite sides of a central\nlinear trough (Fig. 3D).\n\nUnlike the previous described lineaments, L3 is barely seen in the\nhigh-resolution bathymetry. The L4 lineament, although clearly\nobservable in the bathymetry, does not show any consistently\ninterpretable morphologic patterns, probably due to the incoherent\nrheology response to stress of the tectonic m\u00e9lange of the Gulf of Cadiz\naccretionary wedge (see AW in Fig. 1B). For much of its length, L4\ncoincides with the northern border of this disturbed seafloor domain,\nsuggesting that it may be controlled by a deep structure. Because of\nthese features in the present work we will concentrate on L1 and L2 as\nthe main targets for our analogue modelling.\nFig. 2. Bathymetry of NW Gulf of Cadiz MATESPRO campaign, Terrinha et al. (under review).\nlineaments, interpreted in Fig. 4.\n2.2. Structural characterization\n\nThe MCS reflection profiles which crosscut the lineaments L1 to L3\nshow that these coincide with deep seated faults (Figs. 2 and 4). Taking\ninto account the previously established seismostratigraphy in the area\n(e.g. Sartori et al., 1994; Torelli et al., 1997; Tortella et al., 1997), the\ninterpretation of different segments of the IAM line (Fig. 4) shows that\nthese faults cut through Mesozoic units (Jurassic to Cretaceous age),\nand through a late Miocene (Tortonian) body with a typical chaotic\nseismic signature. They also often seem to coincide with possible paths\nof abundant upwards fluid migration, seemingly originated at the base\nof the Mesozoic (Fig. 4A), and previously recognized by several authors\nin this area (e.g. Somoza et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Hensen et al.,\n2007).The upper units of the seismostratigraphic sequence correspond\nto hemipelagic sediments of Plio-Quaternary age, with thickness\nvarying between 0.3 and 0.6 s TWT. In the IAM3 line, the fault\ncorresponding to the L1 lineament, bordering the north-eastern flank of\nthe Coral Patch Ridge (CPR, Fig. 4), is interpreted has having behaved as\na reverse fault, since the Mesozoic reflectors in the hanging wall reveal a\nfolding geometry congruent with shortening (Fig. 5). Based only on\nthese profiles it was not possible to ascribe a definite kinematic\nevolution to the other (L2 and L3) faults. The Plio-Quaternary\nhemipelagic sediments, although some times locally folded, are\ngenerally not cut by the described faults (Fig. 4B). This suggests that\nthe reverse fault kinematics mentioned above, does not correspond to\nthe Present day active kinematics on these structures.\n\nBoth the morphological and structural description of the study\nobjects points to the conclusion that these lineaments correspond to\nthe bathymetric expression of major WNW\u2013ESE trending faults. The\nexamined MCS lines show the Plio-Quaternary hemipelagic sediments\nsealing the faults (Fig. 4), suggesting that the bulk movement along\nthese structures does not correspond to active thrusting. Furthermore,\nthe en-\u00e9chelon crests and troughs associated to L1 seem compatible\nwith a Present day dextral wrenching reactivation (Fig. 3A, B and C).\n\nThe same MCS lines also show that the fault associated to L2\nextends along ca. 200 km, from the accretionary wedge in the East,\ncoinciding with several previously described mud volcanoes (e.g.\nPinheiro et al., 2003), to the Horseshoe abyssal plain in the West,\nwhere it looses its morphologic expression (Figs. 1B and 2). It should\nLocation of the IAM multi-channel seismic reflection profiles intersecting the (L1 to L3)\n\n\n\n36 F.M. Rosas et al. / Marine Geology 261 (2009) 33\u201347\n\n\n\nFig. 4.

Rosas et al. / Marine Geology 261 (2009) 33\u201347\nbe noted that with the available MCS dataset the deep seated fault\nassociated to L2 is perfectible traceable in the Horseshoe abyssal plain,\nand further to the West until the base of the Gorringe Ridge. The\nmentioned fact that its bathymetric expression is practically non-\nexistent in this area is probably due to an average greater thickness of\nthe post Mesozoic sediment pile, particularly in the area close to the\nfootwall of the Horseshoe fault.\n\n3. Analogue modelling\n\nIn the study area recently reported kinematic models derived from\ngeodetic data (Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich et al., 2006; Fernandes\net al., 2007) show a Present day 4 mm/yr convergence rate, along a\ndirection subparallel to the trend of the study morphotectonic\nlineaments (see inset of Fig. 1B). This agrees with the general\npossibility of the prevailing compression being presently dissipated\nthrough bulk dextral wrenching along the major faults associated to\nthese lineaments, which was the main focus of our analogue\nmodelling.\n\nIn the NW Gulf of Cadiz area, the detailed vertical rheology profile\nof the lithosphere, and of the uppermost crust, is unknown. However,\na non-negligible rheology contrast must exist between the lithified,\nharder, Mesozoic units, and the uppermost soft sedimentary cover,\ncorresponding in part to the unconsolidated hemipelagic sediments of\nPlio-Quaternary age. If so, bulk dissipation of the compressive stress\nmust preferably occur in the Mesozoic rigid basement, through dextral\nFig. 3.

Black arrows always indicate the interpreted sense of shear.\nstrike-slip faulting, deforming the overlying soft cover mostly in a\npassive manner. Therefore, our first set of experiments consisted on\nthe simulation of basement, right-lateral, strike-slip faulting, and\ncoupled passive shearing in an overlying soft cover.\n\nNonetheless, given the uncertainty of the upper crust rheology\nprofile in the area, we also preformed a second set of experiments\nassuming that the study faults could nucleate low-angle transpressive\nshearing along an narrow band in the overlying sediments. This\npossibility implies the assumption of a different rheology structure for\nthe upper crust, comprising a less abrupt rheology contrast between a\nsomewhat less viscous basement and the softer sedimentary cover.\nAccordingly, the previously faulted Mesozoic basement must be able\nto deform, at least to some degree, in a ductile way to allow low-angle\ntranspressive shearing in the soft cover sediments along a narrow\nband overlying the fault. It should be noted that in the case of this\nsecond set of experiments, our objective was simply to look at the kind\nof morphotectonic pattern that is expected to form in the soft cover\nalone, under the mentioned transpressional conditions. In all situa-\ntions, we focused mainly on the ductile experimental output,\ncomparing both results with the various natural examples. For the\nbasement strike-slip deformation experiments, we further use this\ncomparison to quantify the amount of shear strain (?), the along strike\ndisplacement (?x), and the age of the corresponding shearing\ndeformation affecting the soft cover sediments.\n\nThe present simulation of wrench fault systems and associated\npassive shearing follows, with some modifications, the work\nhologic features.

Rosas et al. / Marine Geology 261 (2009) 33\u201347\npreviously put forward by other authors (e.g. Wilcox et al., 1973;\nRichard et al., 1991; Richard and Krantz, 1991; Casas et al., 2001). The\nmain difference is that the prime motivation of our analogue\nmodelling was not to theoretical address the study of the implicated\ndeformation regimes (e.g. simple shear, transpression), but instead, to\nuse the obtained experimental results instrumentally, i.e., to compare\nthem with the natural structures to try to quantify the strain involved\nin their formation. Another important difference is that we focused in\nthe formation of ductile structures, rather than brittle ones, to try to\nunderstand the way through which a soft sedimentary cover,\ncomprising poorly or even unconsolidated sediments, endures\ndeformation under the referred conditions.\n\n3.1. First set of experiments: basement strike-slip faulting and coupled\nshear deformation\n\n3.1.1. Experimental procedure\nIn the first set of experiments we used a Perspex strike-slip\n\ndeformation rig (Fig. 6) with dimensions of 50\u00d725\u00d75 cm, comprising\ntwo confining vertical walls and two basal, laterally juxtaposed, rigid\nplates, moving relatively to each other in opposite directions, driven at\nconstant velocity (~0.028 mm s?1) by an electric motor.\n\nThe materials used as analogues of the soft cover seafloor\nsediments include: (1) Dry quartz sand (grain sizeb0.25 mm) with\nnegligible cohesion and a friction angle of about 30\u00b0 to simulate brittle\nsedimentary layers (e.g. Hubbert, 1951; Horsfield, 1977); (2) Trans-\nparent silicone putty (PDMS, a polydimethyl-siloxane, manufactured\nby Dow Corning of Great Britain under the trade name SGM 36) as an\nanalogue of weak layers within the upper crust (see Weijermars\n1986a,b,c for PDMS properties), simulating the deformation behaviour\nof natural sedimentary rocks such as shales, clays or salt (e.g. Ballard\net al., 1987; Vendeville et al., 1987; Richard et al., 1989, 1991; Marques\nand Coelho, 2001; Rosas et al., 2001, 2002). In some experiments a\nmixture of dry sand and a fraction of mortar (~40%) was also used to\nincrease the cohesiveness of the material (measured internal friction\nangle around 35\u00b0), and thus improve the simulated reproduction of\nbrittle structures in the model (e.g. Hampel et al., 2004).\n\nTo simulate passive deformation of a sedimentary cover above a\nbasement strike-slip fault system, we constructed an initial model (see\nFig. 6) in which the rigid basement is represented by the basal Perspex\nplates. These are overlain by a 1 cm thick silicone layer, corresponding\nto the approximately 1 km thickness of the Plio-Quaternary sedimen-\ntary cover (scale?1/100.000). In most experiments a two-layered\nsilicone-sand cake with the same total thickness was used instead, with\nthe intention of monitoring the generation of brittle structures in the\nsand layers, as well as the ones expected to form in the silicone. The\nsurface between the silicone layer and the basal rigid plates is non-\nlubricated, promoting total adherence between them. The relative\nopposite movement of the plates simulates dextral strike-slip along a\npre-existent basement fault plane, transmitting this movement to the\noverlying silicone and sand layers. Square grids, straight lines and\ncircles were drawn on top of the model surface to be used as passive\nstrain markers. The dimensions of the deformation rig are sufficiently\nlarge to guarantee that the bulk of the model is not affected by\nboundary effects. The experiments were repeated several times to\nensure the consistency of the obtained results, and top view photo-\ngraphs were taken at regular time intervals.\n\n3.1.2. Experimental results\nIn the cover silicone-sand layers of our model, the strike-slip\n\nbasement faulting was mostly accommodated through the develop-\nment of different types of brittle and ductile structures (Figs. 7A, B\nand 8).\n\nThe obtained brittle structures are dominant in the sand (sand-\nmortar) layers and comprise mainly (inset of Fig. 8): a) Oblique\nsynthetic Riedel shears (R), orientated at low angles to the bulk shear\ndirection (15\u00b0\u201320\u00b0 for the first increments of deformation); b)\nSynthetic P shears which originate at the tips of R shears also at low\nangles to the shear direction (10\u00b0\u201315\u00b0); c) Few antithetic Riedel shears\n(R') at high angles (70\u00b0\u201375\u00b0) with the bulk shear direction; and d) Few\ntension gashes or extension fractures (T) at original 45\u00b0 to the shear\ndirection.\n\nDuctile structures also developed in the sand layers, but were\nclearly dominant in the silicone cover layers of our models (lower\nright photos of Fig. 7A and B), consisting in sets of en-\u00e9chelon folds,\noriginally formed at 45\u00b0 to the shear direction, and progressively\nrotating towards it as shear strain (?) increased. In the sand layers, the\nen-\u00e9chelon folds are also pervasively cut by an anastomosing grid of\nsynthetic Riedels (R) and P shears (Figs. 7A and 8).\n\n3.2. Second set of experiments: low-angle transpression\n\n3.2.1. Experimental procedure\nAs mentioned above, we carried out this second set of experiments\n\nessentially to be able to monitor the type of morphotectonic patterns\nthat are expected to form under dextral, low-angle, transpression,\naffecting soft cover sediments along a narrow shear band. To do so we\nused a transpressive deformation rig (Fig. 9) comprising two lateral\n(vertical) walls, moving relatively to each other in opposite directions\non top of a fixed (horizontal) basal rigid plate. The walls are driven by\na motor connected to a pair of long screws, pushing them along a\ndirection making a horizontal angle of 15\u00b0 with the shear direction, at\nthe constant velocity of approximately 0.028 mm s?1.\n\nWe employed the same materials with the same properties\ndescribed for the first set of experiments: dry sand as an analogue\nof upper crust brittle behaviour, and transparent silicone putty\n(PDMS) to simulate week layers of the upper crust soft sedimentary\ncover. Similarly to what was described for the first set of experiments,\na sand-mortar mixture was also some times used to favour the\nreproduction of brittle structures.\n\nThe constructed initial model consisted in a 1 cm-thick layered\nsilicone-sand cake (Fig. 9) corresponding to the scaled estimated\nthickness of the Plio-Quaternary sedimentary cover (?1:100,000). It\nshould be noted that in this case the basal Perspex plate does not\nrepresent an analogue of the Mesozoic basement rocks, since we\n\n\n\n39F.M. Rosas et al. / Marine Geology 261 (2009) 33\u201347\nfocused exclusively on the low-angle transpressive shearing affecting\nthe cover.\n\nTotal free slip was achieved along the contact surface of the basal\nPerspex plate with the silicone layer, by lubricating it with neutral\nsoap. Conversely, the contact surface between the silicone layer and\nthe vertical moving walls was non-lubricated, promoting a total\nadherence of the silicone to these walls. Straight lines and circles were\ndrawn on top of the model surface to be used as passive strain\nmarkers. Experiments were repeated several times, and top view\nphotographs were obtain at regular intervals.\nFig. 6. (A) Experimental apparatus and model setting used in the first set of experiments to\nCasas et al., 2001); (B) Top views of the initial state for two of the preformed experiences (\n3.2.2. Experimental results\nIn these experiments (Fig.10A and B) synthetic Riedels (R) also formed\n\nat a low angle to the bulk shear direction, but neither in the silicone layer,\nnor in the sand-mortar one, did any set of en-\u00e9chelon folds developed.\nInstead, in early stages (Fig. 10A), a central elongated bulge formed,\nconsisting in two aligned asymmetric fold segments, trending parallel to\nthe bulk shear direction, and bounded at both sides by incipient, opposite\ndirected, early thrusts. For higher amounts of shortening and lateral\ndisplacement (Fig. 10B), synthetic R shears continued to form, and the\nfolded bulged band narrowed as folds got tighter and thrusts developed.\nsimulate basement strike-slip faulting and coupled shear deformation (modified after\nLAB-PSS#050915 and LAB-PSS#050916).\n\n\n\n40 F.M. Rosas et al. / Marine Geology 261 (2009) 33\u201347\n4. Comparison of the experimental results with the\nnatural examples\n\nFor both sets of experiments the obtained brittle structural\npatterns recorded in the sand cover layers are similar, consisting\nessentially in the more or less pervasive development of synthetic R\nand P shears (see Figs. 7 and 10). Conversely, the ductile patterns,\ncomprising the development of folds both in sand and silicone layers,\nare clearly different, depending on which set of experiments is\nconsidered: for strike-slip basement faulting and coupled passive\nshearing, an en-\u00e9chelon fold pattern was obtained (see Fig. 7A and B),\nwhereas for low-angle transpression a totally different pattern of folds\nformed (see Fig. 10).\n\nIn the first case, the experimentally obtained structural pattern\ncorrelates well with the en-\u00e9chelon spatial distribution of bathymetric\ncrests associated with L1 (Fig. 11A and B), which suggests that this\ncorresponds to a morphotectonic pattern formed passively in the\nseafloor soft sediments, as the result of dominant right-lateral strike-\nslip reactivation of the underlying basement fault.\n\nFor the second set of experiments the obtained structural pattern\nresembles more the morphology characterizing L2 (Fig. 11C),\nsuggesting an origin preferably related with low-angle dextral\nFig. 7. Example of the results obtained in the first set of experiments to simulate basement st\n(experiment LAB-PSS#050916, see corresponding initial state in Fig. 6B1), and (B) using a\nFig. 6B2).

Both L1 and L2 lack any kind of associated\nbrittle structures, such as the R or P shears that formed in the analogue\nmodels. This shows that the deformation which originated the natural\nmorphotectonic patterns was essentially ductile, affecting poorly\nlithified soft sediments of Recent age.\n\nNote that it was not possible to compare the obtained experi-\nmental results with L3 and L4 lineaments, because L3 is hardly\nrecognizable in the bathymetry, and deformation associated with L4 is\nprobably masked by the local wrinkled seafloor morphology (corre-\nsponding to the accretionary wedge domain, AW in Figs. 1B and 2).\n\n4.1. Structural analysis\n\nIn our first set of experiments the en-\u00e9chelon folds were observed\nto form and rotate closely to what is theoretically predicted for passive\nstrain markers in simple shear progressive deformation. In this\ndeformation regime, shear strain (?) is defined as the ratio between\nthe displacement parallel to the shear direction (?x) and the width of\nrike-slip faulting and coupled shear deformation, (A) using a silicone-sand layered cake\ntop layer corresponding to a sand-mortar mixture (LAB-PSS#050915, initial state in\n\n? shear strain.

A classical strain maker corresponds to\nthe strain ellipse of Ramsay and Huber (1983), which in simple shear\nforms instantaneously, for infinitesimal increments of shear strain,\nwith its longest axis at an angle (?) at 45\u00b0 to the shear plane (Fig.12B).\nAs ? shear strain accumulates, the axial ratio of the strain ellipse\nincreases and its longest axis rotates towards the shear plane, with\nconsequent reduction of the angular ? value (Fig. 12B). This behaviour\ncan be simply described in terms of the relation between ? and ?, as in\nthe equation presented by Ramsay and Graham (1970) (see Eq. (1)\nbelow, and Fig. 12B). Accordingly, our experimental results show that,\nfor infinitesimal deformation increments, the en-\u00e9chelon folds formed\nwith their hinges approximately parallel to the e1 principal axis of the\ninstantaneous strain ellipse, at an angle of ??45\u00b0 to the shear plane\n(Fig. 12C), and rotated towards it during the progressive non-coaxial\ndeformation, as ? shear strain increased. This similarity between the\nobserved experimental behaviour of the en-\u00e9chelon folds and\nthe theoretical prediction for simple shear deformation, is shown\nby the good correlation that exists between the points corresponding\nto the measurements made for ? and ? in the succeeding progressive\ndeformation stages of the several experiments done, and the equation\ncurve of Ramsay and Graham (1970) (Fig.12D). This correlation shows\nthat the en-\u00e9chelon folds obtained in our first set of experiments\nformed under deformation conditions similar to bulk simple shear, and\nhence, given the comparison with the natural examples presented\nabove, that the same would also apply to the L1 bathymetric lineament\nand associated natural en-\u00e9chelon folds.\nBased on this deduction, measuring the mean value of ? (=24.20\u00b0)\nin the natural en-\u00e9chelon folds of L1 lineament (see Fig. 11B) made it\npossible to determine the approximate amount of shear strain (?) that\noriginated these structures in their present orientation. This was done\nusing equation\n\n? =\n2\n\ntan2?\n; \u00f01\u00de\n\n(Ramsay and Graham, 1970) in which ?=24.20\u00b0 gives ?=1.78.\nFurthermore, using this ? value and the mean width of the L1\n\nshear zone Y (~4000 m), which was estimated based on the observed\nspatial distribution of the en-\u00e9chelon folds (see Fig. 11B), it was also\npossible to determine the along strike displacement (?x) implied in\nthe shear deformation responsible for the present orientation of the\nen-\u00e9chelon folds. This was done using equation\n\n? = tg W\u00f0 \u00de = ?x\nY\n\n; \u00f02\u00de\n\nof Ramsay and Huber (1983), in which for ?=1.78 and Y=4000 m,\nwe obtain ?x?7000 m.\n\nIn our second set of experiments, concerning the L2 lineament and\nassociated deformation pattern, the absence of natural structures\nuseful as reliable (i.e. measurable) strain markers, did not allow a\nmore quantitative insight, regarding strain quantification of the\ntranspressive shearing, through comparison between the observa-\ntions and the experimental results.\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

This\nestimate is based on the assumption that the cover sediments recording\nthis pattern are soft (poorly lithified), deforming mostly in a ductile\nmanner, which suggests a simultaneous character of sedimentation and\nstrain. In accordance, the syntectonic sedimentation rate would be of\ncritical influence on the nucleation and development of the L1\nstructures, since relatively larger sedimentation rates would tend to\nattenuate the morphologic expression of the developing structures.\nTherefore, the well preserved L1 morphotectonic patterns seemingly\nsuggest low syntectonic sedimentation rates, which agrees with the\naverage 30 cm/Ky (0.3 mm/y) reported by Lebreiro et al. (1997) for the\nhorseshoe abyssal plain.\n\n5. Summary and conclusions\n\nBased on our experimental results, and on the bathymetry and\nseismic reflection data presented above, we conclude that: (1) In the\nGulf of Cadiz, the WNW-ESE lineaments correspond to the bathy-\nmetric expression of active deep seated faults; (2) These faults show a\nPresent day kinematics consisting in bulk dextral wrenching; (3) The\ndeformation which originated the study morphotectonic lineaments\nstarted at a maximum age of ca. 1.8 Ma. (4) These lineaments formed\n\n\n\n46 F.M. Rosas et al. / Marine Geology 261 (2009) 33\u201347\nin soft, most probably, poorly consolidated sediments, deposited at\nrelatively low rates of syntectonic sedimentation.\n\nOur results show that the morphotectonic pattern associated to L1\nwas formed as a consequence of dextral strike-slip reactivation of a\nbasement fault, coupled with passive simple shear deformation of\nthe overlying soft sedimentary cover. On other hand, the seafloor\nbathymetry pattern associated to L2 must have formed preferably as a\nconsequence of low-angle dextral transpression. However, in this case,\nthe uncertainty concerning the local upper crust vertical rheology\nprofile, did not allow a better comprehension of the process governing\nthe nucleation of a transpressive shear band in the soft sedimentary\ncover overlying the correspondent fault. Moreover, since no natural\nstructural features useful as strain gauges were found in this case, a\nmore quantitative insight was also impossible to achieve. It should be\nnoted that L1 borders the northern\u2013eastern flank of the CPR (Figs. 1B,\n2 and 3), which could correspond to a rigid body resisting shortening\nand favouring lateral slip, instead of transpressive shearing, along this\nlimit.\n\n5.1. Tectonic implications\n\nIn the Gulf of Cadiz, the faults associated to the studied lineaments\nwere previously reported to have endured a complex tectonic\nevolution from Early Mesozoic through Cenozoic (Terrinha et al.,\nunder review). Based on the inspected seismic profiles (see Figs. 4 and\n5), it was in some cases possible to recognize a kinematic behaviour\ncharacterized by reverse faulting. These faults cut through the\nMesozoic and the base of the Tortonian chaotic body, but do not\naffect the top of this unit, neither the overlying sediments which are\ngenerally sealing these structures (see Figs. 4 and 5). This shows that\nthe reverse fault kinematics is not presently active.\n\nOur conclusions fit the whole-scale strain partitioning scenario,\nrecently proposed by Terrinha et al. (under review), according to\nwhich the Nubia\u2013Iberia collision in the Gulf of Cadiz area is Presently\nbeing accommodated through oblique westwards thrusting along\nNNE\u2013SSW faults, such as the Horseshoe fault and Marques de Pombal\nactive faults (see Fig. 1B), and simultaneously through bulk dextral\nstrike-slip reactivation of pre-existent WNW\u2013ESE faults, correspond-\ning to the studied bathymetric lineaments. According to our experi-\nmental results, the age of this deformation recorded by Recent bottom\nfloor soft sediments in the Gulf of Cadiz is ca. 1.8 Ma (late Pliocene).\nFurthermore, given the WNW\u2013ESE trend of the faults their interpreted\nkinematic behaviour is in good agreement with the kinematic models\nderived from geodetic data yielding a 4 mm/yr convergence rate,\nsubparallel that same direction.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nExperiments were performed in the Experimental Tectonics\nLaboratory of LATTEX-IDL, a research unit funded by PLURIANUAL\n(125/N/92).

The \n\nobtained results show that newly mapped tectonic structures located in the fault \n\nintersection area (corner zone) consist mostly in oblique (dextral-reverse) faults that \n\ncomply with a preferred stress-strain concentration in that location, caused by thrust-\n\nwrench tectonic interference. In view of these results, a multi-rupture scenario can be \n\nenvisaged from comparison with the natural example, showing the need to carefully \n\nconsidered seismic-related hazards of low to moderate seismicity (up to M7) in the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz area. Moreover, the recognized depth discrepancy between the (upper crust) \n\ninterference fault-pattern and the (lithospheric mantle) seismicity is interpreted as \n\nmailto:frosas@fc.ul.pt\n\n\nsuggestive of a decoupled manifestation of the same thrust-wrench tectonic interference \n\nat different lithospheric depths.     \n\n \n\nKeywords: Gulf of Cadiz; Thrust-wrench tectonics; Analogue Modeling; Numerical \n\nModeling; Lithospheric depth-decoupled deformation. \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\n \n\n The Gulf of Cadiz (Fig. 1A) has long been considered a key domain to unravel \n\nthe complex tectonics of the Eurasia-Africa plate boundary. It corresponds to a specific \n\nsegment of this boundary characterized by the interplay between the Iberia and Nubia \n\nsubplates, connecting the (Atlantic) transform Gloria Fault, in the West, with the dextral \n\ntranspressive Rif-Tell shear zone (Morel and Meghraoui, 1996) to the East of Gibraltar \n\nStraits, and across the Betic-Rif orogenic arc. In the Gulf of Cadiz domain, the Iberia - \n\nN\u00fabia plate boundary has been considered of a diffuse nature (Sartori et al., 1994; \n\nMedialdea et al., 2004), since a Present day WNW-ESE convergence between both \n\nplates at a  ~ 4-5mm/yr  rate, (e.g. Nocquet and Calais, 2004; Stich et al., 2006; \n\nFernandes et al., 2007; Serpelloni et al., 2007, gray line in the inset of Fig. 1B) is here \n\naccommodated by a considerable number of widespread and differently orientated \n\nactive tectonic structures, mostly exhibiting strike-slip and thrust fault kinematics (Fig. \n\n1B). During the last decade, the systematic interpretation of acquired geophysical data \n\n(e.g. reflection/refraction seismics and multi-beam swath bathymetry) led to the \n\nprogressive discover of several new tectonic features, resulting in the continuous \n\nupgrade of the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic map (see Fig. 1B, Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; Terrinha \n\n\n\net al., 2003; Zitellini et al., 2004; Rosas et al., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009; Zitellini et al., \n\n2009; Duarte et al., 2009, 2010). \n\n The seismicity that has been recorded in the Gulf of Cadiz corresponds to a \n\ngeneral scenario of moderate magnitude at shallow to intermediate depths (e.g. Fukao, \n\n1973; Grimison and Chen, 1986; Buforn et al., 1995; Engdahl et al, 1998; Borges et al., \n\n2001; Buforn et al., 2004; Stich et al., 2005), in which a direct correlation between \n\nearthquake location and known major tectonic structures is not straightforward. Large \n\nmagnitude events also exist, such as the 28/02/1969 earthquake (Ms=7.9), and more \n\nnoticeably the highly destructive 1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (estimated magnitude \n\nbetween 8.5 and 8.8, e.g. Abe, 1979; Johnston, 1996; Solares and Arroyo, 2004), and \n\nassociated tsunami (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998a,b; Zitellini et al., 2001; Terrinha et al., \n\n2003; Baptista and Miranda, 2009). In addition, recent studies confirm higher depths for \n\nlow-magnitude local earthquakes (40-60 km, Geissler et al., 2010), highlighting the \n\nrelevance of seismogenic mantle rheology and deep lithospheric structures, \n\ncomplementary to the known (i.e. mapped) shallower crustal faults. The potential \n\nseismic hazard posed by the high magnitude earthquakes continuously triggers the \n\ninterest, and the need, for determining their seismogenic (and tsunamigenic) sources, \n\nand hence to better understand the tectonic evolution of the region.  \n\n \n\n1.1. Tectonic setting \n\n  \n\n In the Gulf of Cadiz tectonic map of figure 1B three main sets of major \n\nstructures can be recognized: 1) The frontal thrust that bounds the so called Gulf of \n\nCadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW, in the eastern half of the study area, Fig. 1B); 2) a \n\nset of NE-SW striking thrust-faults, preferably located to the West of the Horseshoe \n\n\n\nValley (e.g. Horseshoe Thrust Fault, Marqu\u00eas de Pombal Fault, Gorringe Fault); and 3) \n\na set of WNW-ESE dextral strike-slip faults, corresponding to the SWIM wrench \n\nsystem, as defined by Zitellini et al. (2009). According to these authors, the later system \n\ncorresponds to a broad deformation band extending across the whole of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz domain (along 600 km), essentially characterized by sets of major deep seated, \n\nsub-vertical, dextral strike-slip faults: the SWIM faults (see Fig. 1B), which are thought \n\nto be active since at least ~1.8 My (Rosas et al., 2009). Noting the fact that these faults \n\nstrike subparallel to the Present day convergence direction between Nubia and Iberia \n\n(WNW-ESE, see gray line in the inset of Fig. 1B), Zitellini et al. (2009) interpreted this \n\nSWIM Fault Zone as a precursor of a new (dextral) transcurrent plate boundary in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz area. Apart from the GCAW, which Present day activeness and tectonic \n\nsignificance is still intensively debated (Gutscher et al., 2002; Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; \n\nTerrinha et al., 2003, 2009; Gutscher, 2004; Zitellini et al., 2004, 2009; Gutscher et al., \n\n2009a,b), the other most important active structure intersected by one of the SWIM \n\nfaults is the Horseshoe Thrust Fault (HTF - see Fig. 1B). Together with the Marqu\u00eas de \n\nPombal Fault (MPF) this Northwest directed thrust was previously proposed as a \n\npossible seismogenic source of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake (Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; \n\nTerrinha et al., 2003), and corresponds to one of the most unequivocal active structures \n\nin this domain since Tortonian times (at least ~10My, e.g. Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; \n\nZitellini et al., 2004; Terrinha et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n1.2 Present work \n\n  \n\n If the SWIM 1 fault is part of a set of major active strike-slip structures \n\ndelineating the onset of a new (dextral) transcurrent plate boundary, and if these same \n\n\n\nstructures intersect others such as the Horseshoe Thrust Fault also recognized as active, \n\nsome kind of tectonic interference is expected to occur as a consequence. In the present \n\nwork, analogue and 3D finite element numerical modeling experiments were carried out \n\nto understand the structural pattern that develops in a competent brittle medium (e.g. \n\nupper crust) as a result of the mechanical interference between a dominant right-lateral \n\nstrike-slip fault, accounting for the Present day dextral transcurrent SWIM system \n\n(Zitellini et al., 2009), and a thrust fault complying with the also active, west-directed, \n\nHorseshoe thrust fault (see Fig. 1B). Model results were thoroughly compared with the \n\nnatural example, and ensuing implications for its overall tectonic evolution explored \n\nand evaluated. \n\n  \n\n2. Morphotectonic characterization of the study fault-systems \n\n \n\n The area studied in detail in the present work is limited by the dash-lined \n\nrectangle in figure 1B, which bathymetry and correspondent tectonic interpretation is \n\ndepicted in figures 2 and 3, respectively. The newly proposed tectonic map of figure 3B \n\ncorresponds mostly to the area of intersection between the Horseshoe thrust and the \n\nSWIM 1 faults, and it was investigated through the detailed combined analysis of the \n\navailable multi-beam swath bathymetry (SWIM compilation, Zitellini et al., 2009), and  \n\na series of multi-channel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles, acquired during several \n\ndifferent surveys (Fig. 3A; ARRIFANO \u2013 Arco Rifano, IAM - Iberian Atlantic Margin \n\nand SWIM \u2013 South West Iberian Margin, Sartori et al., 1994; Banda et al., 1995; \n\nTortella et al., 1997; Martinez-Loriente et al., 2008). A detailed morphological \n\ncharacterization of the NW Gulf of Cadiz domain, and its several different sub-domains, \n\nwas recently presented by Terrinha et al. (2009). Concurring with their proposal, the \n\n\n\nmain large-scale bathymetric features in the study area are here interpreted as being \n\ntectonically controlled by the activity of the recognized major fault-systems (described \n\nbelow, see Figs. 2 and 3). \n\n Based on the seismic reflection dataset available, a general seismostratigraphy \n\nwas also previously established for this domain (e.g. Sartori et al., 1994; Torelli et al., \n\n1997; Tortella et al., 1997; Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2010) comprising (Figs. 4 \n\nand 5): a) A basal Mesozoic (Jurassic-Cretaceous) unit (~2 s twt) corresponding to \n\ncarbonate sediments; b) A Late Miocene ?chaotic body? unit (~1.5 s twt) with a semi-\n\nchaotic seismic signature, previously interpreted as an olistostrome body or as a tectonic \n\nm\u00e9lange (Torelli et al., 1997; Tortella et al., 1997; Terrinha et al., 2009; Iribarren et al., \n\n2007); and  c) A top Late Miocene to Plio-Quaternary unit (?0.5 s twt), corresponding \n\nto a hemipelagic sedimentary cover. \n\n   \n\n2.1. Horseshoe Thrust Fault \n\n \n\n The NE-SW trending HTF scarp is clearly observed in the bathymetry (Fig. 2A \n\nand B), displaying a maximum height of ca. 1000 m in its north-easternmost segment, \n\ngradually vanishing towards SW (Fig. 2 and 3). The SE half of the study area (mostly \n\ncoinciding with the Horseshoe Valley at depths between -4200m and -4800m \u2013 see Fig. \n\n2) is interpreted to correspond to the hanging wall of the NW directed Horseshoe Thrust \n\nFault (e.g. Tortella et al., 1997; Zitellini et al., 2004;Terrinha et al., 2009), tectonically \n\nuplifted relatively to its footwall, which corresponds to the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain \n\n(HAP) in the NW half of the study area (at depths always greater than -4800 m). In the \n\nIAM4e profile (Figs. 4) the HTF (around shot point 1000 in Fig. 4) is clearly imaged as \n\na SE dipping, deep seated fault. It roots well into the Mesozoic unit, prolonging \n\n\n\nupwards across all the other overlying units, and breaching out at the sea-floor surface, \n\nwhere a resulting prominent deformation is marked by an offset of ca. 420 m (~0.6s twt \n\nin the IAM4e profile). The NW directed thrusting kinematics is clearly shown by the \n\ngeometry of the folds affecting the Mesozoic reflectors near the fault plane, and by the \n\nunambiguous offset of the surface marking the top of the Mesozoic unit (see Fig. 4). To \n\nthe SE of the HTF other relatively minor thrusts affecting the basal Mesozoic unit were \n\npreviously described (e.g. Terrinha et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2010), although these only \n\naffect the base of the overlying Late Miocene chaotic body (see Fig. 4).  The same \n\nauthors also report some degree of tectonic imbrication within the Miocene chaotic \n\nbody further to SE, only mildly perturbing the sea-floor morphology. \n\n \n\n2.2. SWIM 1 fault \n\n \n\n The SWIM system was previously described by Zitellini et al. (2009) as \n\ncorresponding to a set of WNW-ESE trending, vertical right-lateral strike-slip faults, \n\ncharacterized by a hundred-kilometer long linear bathymetric expression, ranging from \n\nthe foots of the Gorringe Bank, in the West Gulf of Cadiz, across the HAP, the \n\nHorseshoe Valley and the GCAW, reaching its easternmost area near the Straits of \n\nGibraltar (see Fig. 1B). The SWIM 1 fault (Figs. 1, 2 and 3) is crossed both by the \n\nIAM4 and the IAM3 seismic profiles (Fig. 5), where it can be observed to correspond to \n\na deep-seated sub-vertical fault. It cuts across all the main seismostratigraphic units, \n\noccasionally breaching out, and it roots in the lower pre-Mesozoic (?) basement. Some \n\nsegments of the fault exhibit an overall geometry resembling flower-like structures (Fig. \n\n5B), agreeing with the previously proposed transcurrent kinematics (Duarte et al., 2009; \n\nTerrinha, et al., 2009; Zitellini, et al., 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n2.3. The new corner zone tectonic framework \n\n \n\n The SWIM 1 fault intersects the Horseshoe thrust near its SW termination (Figs. \n\n2 and 3). In the HAP, away from the HTF, the SWIM 1 lineament is not prominently \n\nrecorded in the bathymetry, although the continuation of the correspondent basement \n\nstrike-slip fault was thoroughly mapped further to the West, until the foothills of the \n\nGorringe Bank, flanking its south-western termination (see Figs. 1B and 3B, Duarte et \n\nal., 2009; Terrinha et al., 2009). Interpretation of the available seismic dataset in this \n\nspecific area (see Fig. 3A) led for the first time to the recognition of a new tectonic \n\nconfiguration (see map of Fig. 3B) comprising other faults \u2013 e.g. CF1 and CF2 - located \n\nnear the intersection (corner zone) between the SWIM 1 strike-slip and the Horseshoe \n\nthrust, and also lacking any significant morphological expression in the HAP sea-floor \n\n(Fig. 3B and 5). In the IAM4 profile it is possible to observe that these corner faults \n\ncorrespond to steep (southwards) dipping faults, rooting in the basement underneath the \n\nMesozoic unit and cutting across the overlying units, including the base of the Late \n\nMiocene to Plio-Quaternay top unit (see Fig. 5). In the case of CF1 the sea-floor surface \n\nis also perturbed (around sp 4840 in IAM4 profile, and black arrow in Figs. 2 and 3B), \n\nwhereas CF2 lacks any kind of bathymetric expression. In the IAM4 profile a reverse-\n\nfault component of movement along both CF1 and CF2 faults is apparent, revealed \n\nnamely by the offset of the upper limit of the Mesozoic unit across these faults that \n\nclearly denounces the upward movement of the respective SE fault blocks (see Fig. 5). \n\nSince the faults are highly steep, a pure dip-slip thrusting movement is mechanically \n\nimplausible in this situation. In contrast, oblique-slip faults, characterized by a \n\n\n\nfundamentally dextral transcurrent kinematics and a minor thrusting component, would \n\nmechanically adequate to the observed structural geometry. \n\n Adding to this structural evidence, recently proposed relocation of low to \n\nmoderate magnitude earthquakes in the study area (Geissler et al., 2010), showed the \n\nexistence of two clusters, concentrating near the northern and southern terminations of \n\nthe HTF (Fig. 6, Geissler et al., 2010). The southern cluster coincides with the SWIM 1- \n\nHTF corner zone area, and exhibits a WNW-ESE general trend parallel to the SWIM 1 \n\nfault. It should be noted that most of these hypocenters are located at relatively high \n\ndepths (40-55 km), probably in the lithospheric mantle (Geissler et al., 2010; Sallar\u00e8s et \n\nal., 2011), and thus cannot be directly linked to the faults imaged by the MCS profiles at \n\nupper crustal levels (maximum depths of ca.6km; see discussion below in section 5). \n\nNevertheless, the reported corresponding focal mechanisms solutions in this corner zone \n\ndomain show significant heterogeneity, possibly due to varied fault orientation, but \n\ngenerally accounting for dominant reverse and strike-slip faulting (Geissler et al., 2010). \n\n These tectonic and seismic corner-zone manifestations are here hypothetically \n\nconsidered to have formed as the result of a particular type of thrust-wrench tectonic \n\ninterference between the Horseshoe and the SWIM systems at different depths. The \n\nupper-crust fault interference between the SWIM1 dextral strike-slip and the HTF is \n\nexpected to provide some insight on the causes for the recorded seismicity at higher \n\n(mantle) depths, and is thus investigated and tested through the analogue and numerical \n\nmodeling experiments presented below. \n\n \n\n3. Analogue modeling \n\n \n\n\n\n Analogue modeling experiments of separated wrench systems (e.g. Mandl et al., \n\n1977; Richard et al., 1991; Dooley and McClay, 1997; McClay and Bonora, 2001; \n\nSchopfer and Steyrer, 2001; Le Guerroue and Cobbold, 2006) and thrust systems (e.g. \n\nMalavieille,  1984; Mulugeta, 1988; Lallemand et al., 1994; Gutscher et al., 1998a,b; \n\nAgarwal and Agarwal 2002; Lohrmann et al., 2003; Ellis et al., 2004; McClay et al., \n\n2004; Bonnet et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007; Malavieille, 2010) are common and well \n\ndocumented. Conversely, physical modeling dealing with the deformation caused by \n\nsimultaneous thrusting and wrenching is less common, and generally focused on a \n\nvariety of different specific aspects (e.g. Diraison et al., 2000; Di Bucci et al 2006, \n\n2007). Hence the present work, in which sand-box analogue models were produced to \n\nbetter understand the deformation patterns resulting from thrust-wrench fault \n\ninterference under the specific conditions of the study area.    \n\n \n\n3.1. Experimental method \n\n \n\n3.1.1. Material properties and scaling  \n\n Experiments were done using dry quartz sand which properties are summarized \n\nin Table 1. Sand is considered a Coulomb material deforming in a brittle way according \n\nto the Coulomb fracture criterion (e.g. Hubbert, 1937, 1951; Davis et al., 1983, \n\nAppendix A), and it has been extensively used in scaled model experiments simulating \n\nbrittle deformation in the upper crust or other lithospheric competent levels. Since \n\nbrittle deformation is time independent while inertial acceleration is negligible, scaling \n\nwas achieved through classically considering model-prototype ratios of fundamental \n\nunits (Hubbert, 1937), only for mass (through density) and length (?=Lmod/Lprot=5x10\n-6\n\n \n\n\n\nor 1/200.000). All the assumed model - prototype ratios are presented in Table 1, and \n\nthe detailed procedure of scaling is specified in Appendix A.  \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Apparatus, initial stage and procedure  \n\n All the experiments were carried out in the 100 x 60 cm Perspex deformation \n\nbox depicted in figure 7. The box consists in two horizontal 1cm thick basal plates \n\n(plates A and B in Fig. 7) that move relatively to each other along the X direction, \n\nsimulating a right-lateral strike-slip (basement) fault. A thin metal sheet attached to the \n\nbase of a backstop is moved by a stepping motor also along the X direction, sliding on \n\ntop of both basal plates (Fig. 7A). The front of this metal sheet works as a velocity \n\ndiscontinuity (VD) at an angle of 60\u00ba/120\u00ba with the direction of the strike-slip fault (X \n\ndirection). Two fixed lateral vertical walls confine the whole system. In the initial stage, \n\na layered sand cake was mounted inside the box on top of the intersection between the \n\nbasal strike-slip fault and the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 7B). This was achieved by \n\npouring batches of differently colored sand from a moving elongated funnel (with a \n\nwidth matching the 60cm of the box), guarantying the leveling of its top surface. In \n\nmost experiments the sand cake thickness was 3cm (corresponding to 6 km in nature), \n\nalthough in several experiments thickness of 4 and 5 cm (8 and 10 km) were also \n\nconsidered. Layering in the sand cake has no correspondence with any natural \n\nstructures, and was used merely as a 3D strain marker, since in the end-stage of all the \n\nexperiments the deformed sand cake was humidified, and several slices were serially cut \n\nalong different chosen orientations. Likewise, parallel (or sometimes square) line grids \n\nwere also imprinted on the top surface of the model to serve as (2D) passive strain \n\nmarkers. In the present modeling the driving kinematics was conceived to correspond to \n\nthe basal right-lateral strike-slip faulting, concurring with the natural example where the \n\n\n\ndextral SWIM faults are observed to strike subparallel to the Present day convergence \n\nbetween Iberia and Nubia as shown by the reported geodetic data (e.g. Nocquet and \n\nCalais, 2004; Stich et al., 2006; Fernandes et al., 2007; Serpelloni et al., 2007, see gray \n\nline in the inset of Fig. 1B). In accordance, all the experiments comprised the following \n\ntwo successive steps (see Fig. 7A):  \n\n \n\n1) A very brief preliminary one that consisted in moving the backstop (and the \n\nattached thin metal sheet) along the X direction to the left, only until few thrusts \n\nwere observed to have formed breaching out at the top surface of the sand cake. \n\nThis was done merely to produce an initial planar week anisotropy representing \n\nthe original geometry of the HTF system, at an angle of 60/120\u00ba with the basal \n\n(SWIM) strike-slip direction. \n\n  \n\n2) A second one that consisted in moving the basal plates relatively to each other \n\n(also along X), by pushing the furthest plate (basal plate A) to the right (see Fig. \n\n7A), producing a right-lateral strike-slip movement along the vertical contact \n\nsurface between both basal plates, simulating the (SWIM 1) basement vertical \n\nstrike-slip fault.   \n\n \n\nDuring step 2, the central (?corner zone?) domain of basal plate A was limited by two \n\nmain kinematically active boundaries: one corresponding to the trace of the basal strike-\n\nslip fault, and the other to the velocity discontinuity (see Fig. 7A). Since the dextral \n\nstrike-slip along the contact with plate B was accomplished by moving plate A to the \n\nright, the boundary between this plate and the over-sliding thin metal sheet (velocity \n\ndiscontinuity) corresponded to a convergent limit between the sand above basal plate A, \n\n\n\nand the sand sitting on top of the thin metal sheet (edged by the velocity discontinuity). \n\nThus, the driving forces for deformation in the sand came from the relative movement \n\nbetween the sliding basal plates and the thin metal sheet, which were both in frictional \n\ncontact with the overlying sand. As result, during the second experimental step, the sand \n\ncake on top of the boundary between both basal plates endured dextral wrenching \n\ndeformation, whereas simultaneously shortening accommodated by thrusting occurred \n\nin the sand above the velocity discontinuity. Stepping motors were used to move both \n\nthe backstop and the basal plates at a constant velocity (~20cm/hr). The dimensions of \n\nthe deformation box were sufficiently large to guarantee that the bulk of the model was \n\nnot affected by boundary effects, and experiments were repeated several times to ensure \n\nthe consistency of the obtained results. Besides photos of serially cut sections of the \n\n(end-stage) deformed models, top view photographs were also taken at regular time \n\nintervals as the experiments unfolded.    \n\n \n\n3.2. Experimental results \n\n \n\n The main obtained results are depicted in figures 8 and 9. During the first \n\nexperimental step a pop-up structure always formed, bounded by a pair of opposite ~30\u00ba \n\ndipping (fore and back) thrusts, rooting in the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 8A1). During \n\nthe second experimental step, different types of structures were simultaneously formed \n\nin the different areas of the model analyzed below. \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Thrust-front and wrenching domains \n\nIn the area in front of the main thrust and relatively away from the corner zone \n\n(thrust-front domain depicted in Fig.8), the incremental accumulation of shortening \n\n\n\nresulting from moving basal plate A to the right could no longer be exclusively \n\naccommodated by the original pair of thrusts (forethrust and backthrust) formed during \n\nexperimental step1 (Fig. 8A1), and thus new forethrusts were successively formed (Fig. \n\n8A2-A3 and B-C). As is classically the case in these type of experiments (e.g. Bonini et \n\nal., 2000; Persson and Sokoutis, 2002; Lohrmann et al., 2003; Maillot and Koyi, 2006; \n\nKoyi and Maillot, 2007) each new thrust rooted in the VD and accommodated a certain \n\namount of shortening, before being transported along the backthrust fault plane when a \n\nnewer forethrust was formed, leading to the end-term situation depicted in figure 9B \n\n(cross section 6). \n\n Simultaneously, in the sand cake above the basal strike-slip fault (wrenching \n\ndomain as defined in figure 8), the first formed structures were en-\u00e9chelon Riedel faults \n\n(Riedel, 1929, R-faults in Fig. 8A2) orientated at low angles to the basement strike-slip \n\ndirection (15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 for the first increments of deformation). Between these, several P-\n\nfaults also developed. Offset of parallel lines on model surface by R and P faults \n\nshowed a synthetic (dextral) strike-slip component of movement along these structures. \n\nFurther strike-slip increments (Fig. 8A3) originated Y-faults that formed parallel to the \n\nbasement fault direction, cut the early R and P-faults, and also exhibited dextral strike-\n\nslip kinematics. As shear strain accumulated, the surface area between the R-faults rose \n\nsignificantly (compare the topography of Figs. 8A2 and A3) originating a deformation \n\nband parallel to the basement fault with a characteristic surface morphology, comprising \n\nseveral sub-parallel elongated bulges (see Fig. 8A3). Subsequent strike-slip increments \n\nmostly produced a continued reduction of the width of the previously formed \n\ndeformation band, besides the amplification of its relief. In cross sections cut \n\nperpendicular to the deformation band (Fig. 9 \u2013 cross sections 1 and 2) the observed \n\noverall fault pattern corresponded to an upwards splaying from the basement fault, \n\n\n\ntypically defining a flower structure. Within this, R-faults exhibited in some degree a \n\nreverse component of movement, in line with an oblique (dextral-reverse) kinematics, \n\nalthough in the complete absence of any externally induced compression. These \n\nstructures are typical of wrench fault systems, and confirm previous standard modeling \n\nresults (e.g. Mandl et al., 1977; Richard et al., 1991; Dooley and McClay, 1997; \n\nMcClay and Bonora, 2001; Schopfer and Steyrer, 2001; Le Guerroue and Cobbold, \n\n2006). Specifically, the occurrence of oblique dextral-reverse kinematics along \n\nhelicoidal R-faults in the absence of any externally induced compression, was \n\npreviously explained as a result of 5-10% of dilatation in the sand, which is also thought \n\nto occur in similar degree in brittle natural rocks (e.g. Schopfer and Steyrer, 2001; Le \n\nGuerroue and Cobbold, 2006).  \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Corner zone \n\n In the corner zone (as defined in Fig. 8), a lateral propagation of the thrust faults \n\n(F2,F3\u2026 Fn) to the wrenching domain was consistently observed, characterized by a \n\nrotation of these faults towards an orientation sub-parallel to the basal strike-slip \n\ndirection (i.e. X axis, e.g. F2 in Fig.8A2 and B; F3 in Fig.8C). This parallelization \n\noccurred since relatively early strike-slip increments, and implied a clockwise rotation \n\nof about 60\u00ba around an inflexion point (IP in Figs. 8A2, B and C). Offset of parallel \n\nstrain marker lines along these rotated fault segments agree with a dextral strike-slip \n\ncomponent of movement. In sections cut across the same structures (Fig. 9 \u2013 cross \n\nsection 3, 4 and 5), it was apparent that these also maintained a thrusting component, in \n\naccordance with general dextral-reverse oblique kinematics (e.g. F5 in cross section 3 \n\nand 4 of Fig.9). In some experiments, strain accommodation in the corner zone implied \n\nthe formation of new forethrusts in front of previously rotated fault segments (e.g. F3 \n\n\n\nand F2 respectively in corner zone domain of Fig. 8A3), which as a result ceased to \n\npropagate and were passively thrusted in the hanging wall of the newer thrust-faults. \n\nSubsequently, these newer thrusts were themselves rotated also towards the basal strike-\n\nslip fault direction, mimicking the rotation of the previous ones. For further strike-slip \n\nincrements, the early formed structures in the corner zone were masked by the later \n\ndeformation and became eventually indistinguishable. As a result, only the younger \n\nouter (oblique) faults were possible to observe in this domain (compare F5 outer thrust \n\nwith F3 and F4 in Fig. 9A). The earlier (inner) thrusts tended to become more parallel to \n\nthe strike-slip direction (i.e. they rotated more, e.g. F2 in Figs. 8A2, B and F3 in Fig. \n\n8C) than the later outer ones, which generally displayed a more oblique direction, \n\nsubperpendicular to the one bisecting the angle made by basal strike-slip and the \n\nvelocity discontinuity (e.g. F5 in Fig. 9A). In cross sections cutting both the wrenching \n\ndeformation band and the thrust domain, obtained progressively closer to the zone of \n\nintersection between the basal strike-slip and the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 9A and B - \n\ncross sections 3, 4 and 5), it was possible to observe the along space variation of the \n\ninterference between wrench-related and thrust-related structures: \n\n \n\nIn cross section 3 (Fig. 9B), wrench and thrust domains can still be individualized. In \n\nthe wrench domain, the corresponding deformation band was observed to be bounded, \n\non the left, by a rotated segment of an outer thrust (F5, in Figs. 9A and B), and on the \n\nright by a Riedel fault. Both these structures showed some degree of dip-slip reverse \n\nmovement, corresponding to dextral-reverse oblique faults bounding a transpressive \n\npop-up, cut by Y-faults in its middle. The thrust domain along this same direction also \n\ncorresponded to a (slightly asymmetric) pop-up structure, although in this case bounded \n\nby faults lacking any kind of strike-slip component of movement, formed during the \n\n\n\nfirst experimental step (faults in yellow in cross section 3 of Fig. 9B): on the left two \n\nforethrusts (F1 and F2), and on the right the original backthrust (BT).  \n\n \n\nCross section 4 was cut closer to the intersection between the basal strike-slip fault and \n\nthe velocity discontinuity (Fig. 9B \u2013 cross section 4). In this cross-section the right-\n\nbounding R-fault of the wrench domain was no longer observed, and instead the two \n\noriginal left-bounding faults of the thrust domain (F1 and F2) occurred immediately to \n\nthe right of the Y-faults. It should be noted that to the left of these Y-faults, all the \n\nothers (F3 \u2013 F5) also accommodated some amount of dextral wrenching, consisting in \n\nrotated segments of original thrusts exhibiting oblique (dextral-reverse) kinematics. \n\nConversely, to the right of the Y-faults, the (F1 and F2) thrusts lacked any kind of \n\nwrenching component.  \n\n \n\nCross section 5 was cut through a direction containing the intersection between the trace \n\nof the basal strike-slip fault and the velocity discontinuity (Fig. 9B \u2013 cross section 5). \n\nAlong this direction the separation between thrust and wrench domains was no longer \n\nstraightforward. Instead a single interference domain was observed, comprising both \n\noriginal pure thrusts, formed during the first experimental step (F1, F2 and BT faults in \n\nyellow in Fig. 9B \u2013 cross section 5), and dextral strike-slip Y-faults as well as oblique \n\ndextral-reverse faults, formed during experimental step 2 (Y and F3-F5 faults in black \n\nin Fig. 9B \u2013 cross section 5). F1 and F2 faults were positioned to the left of Y-faults \n\nalong this same cross-section, with the first steepening at depth towards the second, \n\ntogether defining a tulip-like (positive) flower-structure geometry, complying with \n\noverall (dextral) transpressional kinematics. \n\n  \n\n\n\n4. Numerical modeling \n\n \n\n Given the same general rheological, geometrical and kinematical constraints \n\ndescribed above for the SWIM 1 - HTF tectonic system, wrench-thrust mechanical \n\ninterference was simulated in a three-dimensional plate model using the \n\nABAQUS/Standard software (ABAQUS, Inc. 2009). In this case the main objective was \n\ntwofold: \n\n \n\na) Examine the patterns of stress and strain distribution in the corner zone area and at \n\ndepth, which could not be achieved by analogue modeling alone; \n\n \n\nb) Investigate the influence of an interbedded soft layer in the development of the corner \n\nzone deformation pattern, likewise benefiting from the numerical modeling approach \n\nthat allows a simpler way of directly manipulating the rheological stratified structure of \n\nthe model. \n\n \n\n4.1. Model setup  \n\n \n\n A basic model was considered (MOD1) representing an upper crustal block \n\ncovering an area of 480 x 180 km, with a thickness of 6 km (Fig. 10A and C). This \n\nthickness complies with the maximum depth imaged by the available reflection seismics \n\n(e.g. TWT-depth conversion of IAM?4 line across the HAP by Jim\u00e9nez?Munt et al., \n\n2010 and G\u00f3nzalez et al., 1998). Present model results were drawn from a central 240 x \n\n180 km subarea, to avoid boundary effects. Two planes of weakness, i.e. idealized \n\nfaults, account for the Horseshoe thrust and SWIM 1 dextral strike-slip, dipping 30\u00b0 and \n\n\n\n90\u00b0 respectively, and intersecting each other with their surface traces making an angle \n\nof 120\u00ba/60\u00ba as in the natural example (see Figs. 2 and 3). \n\n The interpretation of the available seismic reflection dataset also supports the \n\nassumption of a ~1.5 km thick layer, corresponding to the Late Miocene ?Chaotic \n\nBody? unit (see Figs. 4 and 5), at approximately 1.5 km below the seafloor. This \n\n?chaotic? seismic signature has been previously interpreted as resulting from a mixture \n\nof olistostromes and tectonic m\u00e9langes (Torelli et al., 1997; Tortella et al., 1997; \n\nTerrinha et al., 2009; Iribarren et al., 2007), which could hypothetically determine a \n\nrelatively less competent, or event somewhat soft, rheological behavior. Such a \n\npossibility is here simulated by including an interbedded soft layer in the second set of \n\nmodels (MOD2). Also in this case the strike-slip fault does not reach the seafloor \n\nsurface, as it terminates at the top of the soft layer at 1.5 km depth (Fig. 10D). This \n\nmimics the natural example were the SWIM1 fault shows little bathymetric expression \n\n(see Figs. 2 and 3), only mildly perturbing the top Late Miocene to Plio-quaternary unit \n\nin a few situations, although always undoubtedly cutting across the underlying Miocene \n\n?Chaotic body? unit (see Fig. 5). \n\n \n\n4.1.1. Rheologic and fault parameters \n\n Although ABAQUS comes with many material behavior benchmarks we needed \n\nto conduct a large number of systematic tests to select the material properties. The most \n\nchallenging were the material properties of the cohesive elements that constitute the \n\nfaults, since they are commonly calibrated for small scale fractures found in engineering \n\nproblems, and not for large scale geologic faults. Our approach was to iteratively \n\nchange the parameters until we found displacement and stress solutions compatible with \n\nthe natural estimates and observations. The Drucker-Prager plasticity model was chosen \n\n\n\nto model the brittle crustal behavior, since it is intended for geological materials that \n\nexhibit pressure-dependent yield and was found to be more stable than the Mohr-\n\nCoulomb model. Since we were not interested in examining the details of the stress \n\ndistribution within the soft layer a simple Von-Mises plasticity model was chosen to \n\nmodel the soft layer in MOD2. The Von-Mises material yields at a lower stress than the \n\nsurrounding crustal material to simulate a decoupling layer. \n\n The thrust and strike-slip faults are modeled as layers of cohesive elements. \n\nThese are specifically designed for bonded interfaces where the interface thickness is \n\nnegligibly small compared to other model dimensions. The constitutive response of the \n\ncohesive layer is defined in terms of an elastic traction versus separation law, i.e. there \n\nare three components of separation, one normal to the interface and two parallel to it. To \n\nprevent faults from opening or closing the normal component (E) is much stiffer than \n\nthe in-plane components (G1 and G2). The thrust fault has greater G1 and G2 values \n\nthan the strike-slip fault following the Coulomb-Navier\u2019s law of fracture strength. All \n\nthe material parameters are listed in Table 2. \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Boundary conditions and procedure \n\n The boundary conditions try to match those of the analogue modeling \n\nexperiments as closely as possible. Deformation is simulated by moving basal plate A to \n\nthe right relatively to plate B (see Fig. 10A). Because there are some stiffness along the \n\nstrike-slip fault, plate B is dragged by plate A towards the thrust fault. The maximum \n\nprescribed displacement along the X direction was 10 km, yielding a maximum \n\nshortening of 2%. Both basal plates are fixed in along the Y direction. Gravity \n\n(g=9.8m/s\n2\n) is applied as a body force. To counterbalance the weight of the overlying \n\ncrust a lithostatic pressure is applied at the bottom of the model. Isostasy is simulated by \n\n\n\napplying spring forces at the bottom of the model with stiffness per unit area equal to \n\n(?m- ?w)g where ?m=3300 km/m\n3\n is the mantle density and ?w=1000 km/m\n\n3\n is the \n\nwater density.  \n\n \n\n4.2. Model Results  \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Displacement pattern  \n\n Deformation of the basic model (MOD1) is illustrated by vertical displacement \n\ncontours on a strained reference frame (i.e. grid, Fig. 10B), which shows that the \n\nrightwards push of basal plate A was accommodated by movement along both the thrust \n\nand strike-slip faults. Flexure of the plate also occurred in response to the topographical \n\nload caused by the fault offset, in agreement with the flexural theory of faulting. For 2% \n\nof shortening the maximum throw along the thrust fault was 1300 m (Fig. 10B), which \n\nis above the maximum observed throw along the Horseshoe Thrust Fault (~1000 m). It \n\nshould be noted that in nature instead of a single thrust a system of thrusts \n\naccommodates the shortening (see, Fig. 4), implying that the maximum allowed \n\nshortening is underestimated in the simulation, whereas the fault\u2019s throw is \n\noverestimated.  \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Stress pattern  \n\n The stress field was analyzed in terms of maximum shear stress \u00bd(?3- ?1) at the \n\ntop and bottom of the plate (Fig. 11A). In both models (MOD1 and MOD2) it was \n\nobserved that: a) The stresses were larger at the bottom than at the top of the plate, and \n\nlargest stresses occurred at depth in the footwall of the thrust fault; b) At the top of the \n\nplate the largest stress contours occurred in the thrust hanging wall, elongated parallel to \n\n\n\nthe thrust direction; c) At the bottom of the plate the largest stress contours were also \n\naligned parallel to the thrust, but were located in its footwall instead; and most \n\nimportant d) with the exception of MOD 2 surface, stress contours consistently show a \n\nstress concentration in the corner zone (MOD1 Z=0 and 6000m and MOD2 Z=6000m in \n\nFig. 11A). These corner stress magnitudes were larger and their distribution was wider \n\nat depth, whereas at the surface of MOD2 stress concentration was practically absent in \n\nthe corner zone area. In this case, where the strike-slip fault was not prescribed above a \n\nsoft layer (see Fig. 10D), the level of stress affecting the model plate was generally \n\nlower relatively to MOD1. Additionally, shear stress was focused along the direction of \n\nthe strike-slip fault at the model surface (MOD2, Z=0m in Fig. 11A), although not at its \n\nbottom (Z=6000m) where a corner stress concentration clearly persisted (MOD2, \n\nZ=6000m in Fig. 11A). Likewise, the plot of principal stresses at model surface shows \n\nthat in MOD1 the stress directions clearly rotate near the corner zone, and the maximum \n\ncompressive stress magnitude increases by a factor of 1/3 (Fig. 11B, MOD1).  \n\nConversely, in MOD2 the maximum compressive stress orientation showed a constant \n\nobliquity (of 45\u00ba-50\u00ba) relatively to the strike-slip direction, without significantly varying \n\nits magnitude (Fig. 11B, MOD2). This is consistent with the focusing of shear \n\ndeformation along the direction of the SWIM fault, in accordance with the contoured \n\nstress distribution mentioned above (MOD2, Z=0m in Fig. 11A). \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Initiation of brittle rupture (exceeded failure criterion)  \n\n The plot of the locations where the Drucker-Prager failure criterion was first \n\nexceeded in the plate model (Fig. 12) also showed the corner zone as one of the places \n\nwhere this occurred, both at the top (MOD1) and bottom of the plate. In both models, at \n\n6 km depth, brittle failure was predicted to occur in the corner zone and parallel to the \n\n\n\nHorseshoe Thrust Fault direction over a distance of 45 km. At the surface, both models \n\nshowed rupture initiation in the hanging wall of the Horseshoe thrust, parallel to its \n\ndirection, complying with the location of a backthrust. Also concurring with the stress \n\ndistribution pattern described above, at the surface of the model plate, corner zone \n\nrupture initiation was only observed in MOD1 (Z=0m), and was absent at the surface of \n\nMOD 2 (Fig. 12, MOD2, Z=0m), where failure was preferably predicted to occur along \n\nthe direction of the strike-slip fault.  \n\n \n\n4.2.4. Strain pattern  \n\n The strain pattern was analyzed in terms of the equivalent plastic strain, i.e. the \n\ntotal unrecoverable strain accumulated after the onset of yielding according to the \n\nDrucker-Prager criterion. The pattern of plastic strain for both models is shown at three \n\nlevels (Fig. 13): the top of the plate (Z=0m), the level corresponding to base of the soft \n\nlayer in MOD2 at 3000 m depth, and the bottom of the plate (Z=6000m). The results \n\ncan be summarized as follows: \n\n \n\na) The largest strains were focused in the corner zone at all levels of MOD1, and strain \n\nconcentration was larger in magnitude at depth than at the surface of the model (Fig. 13 \n\ncompare in MOD1 Z=0m with Z=3000m and Z=6000m). \n\n \n\nb) In MOD1 besides the corner zone, strain contours also occurred elongated parallel to \n\nthe thrust direction, either in the footwall of the thrust at the base of the model (Fig. 13, \n\nZ=6000m), or more widely distributed in its hanging wall at the surface of the model \n\n(Z=0m). \n\n \n\n\n\nc) At MOD2 surface (Fig. 13, Z=0m) strain concentration occurred in the footwall of \n\nthe thrust, along a 20 km wide deformation band parallel to the direction of the \n\nunderlying strike-slip fault. At the base of the soft layer, strain also concentrated in the \n\nsame area, but was clearly more widely distributed within plate A (Fig. 13, Z=3000m). \n\n \n\nd) In MOD2 at the base of the model (Fig. 13, Z=6000m) corner zone strain \n\nconcentration persisted, but was clearly reduced relatively to MOD1 at the same depth. \n\n \n\n5. Discussion \n\n \n\n Both analogue and numerical modeling results clearly show the importance of a \n\ncorner effect expressed by the deformation pattern that is expected to develop in a brittle \n\nmedium due to the mechanical interference between a dextral strike-slip fault and a \n\nthrust, intersecting each other at an angle of 120\u00ba/60\u00ba. Analogue modeling provides a \n\ncharacterization of the resultant basic structural pattern, revealing its essential geometry \n\nand kinematics. Numerical modeling provides insight on the way stress and strain are \n\nfundamentally distributed under the same conditions, and considers the effects of simple \n\nrheological variation accounting for an interbedded soft layer within the same brittle \n\nmedium. \n\n \n\n5.1 Analogue modeling output \n\n \n\n The experimentally obtained structural pattern is mostly characterized by a \n\nconcentration in the corner zone of (see Figs. 8 and 9): a) oblique (dextral-reverse) \n\nfaults, with different evolving geometries and associated kinematics; and b) vertical \n\n\n\n(dextral) strike-slip Y-faults. While Y-faults remain geometrically and kinematically \n\nstationary as strain accumulates in this area, corner zone oblique faults do not, \n\ncorresponding to segments of originally pure thrusts that progressively propagate and \n\nrotate from the thrust-front to the wrench domain (see Fig. 8). This propagation-rotation \n\nis matched by a corresponding change in kinematics; from pure (reverse dip-slip) \n\nthrusting, to oblique (transcurrent dominant) dextral-reverse faulting. Early formed \n\nfaults undergo a greater amount of more abrupt rotation, with their planes being more \n\npromptly parallelized to the basal strike-slip direction (F2 in Figs. 8A2 and B, and F3 in \n\nFig. 8C). As strain continues to accumulate in the corner zone these same planes also \n\nbecome steeper (from an original dip of ~30\u00ba), and eventually subparallel to the Y-\n\nfaults, preferably accommodating dextral strike-slip movement (see for instance in F3 \n\nand F4 in cross section 4 of Fig.9B). Later (outer) faults in the corner zone endure \n\nrelatively less displacement, and thus are less rotated and steepened, striking somewhat \n\nsubperpendicularly to the bisector of the angle defined by the thrust-front and the \n\nwrenching domains (see for instance F5 in Fig. 9A and cross section 5). \n\n These results show that in this particular structural setting faults genetically \n\nrelated either to the wrench or to the thrust system do not evolve independently. Active \n\nstrike-slip faulting in the wrench domain simultaneously triggers reverse (dip-slip) \n\nfaulting in the thrust domain, which subsequently evolve to oblique-slip faulting \n\ntowards the corner zone. \n\n \n\n5.2. Numerical modeling output \n\n \n\n\n\n The numerical modeling results comply with the existence of a wrench-thrust \n\ninterference corner effect, in accordance with the structural pattern obtained in the \n\nanalogue modeling experiments. \n\n \n\n5.2.1. MOD1  \n\n Stress and strain contours obtained for MOD1 reveal a consistent concentration \n\nin the corner zone, both at the bottom and at the surface of the model (see Figs. 11A and \n\n13, MOD1).  Likewise, plot of brittle rupture initiation (Fig. 12, MOD1) also shows that \n\nfailure is prompt to initiate in the same interference area. This agrees with the corner \n\nzone concentration of faults that characterizes the structural pattern formed in the \n\nanalogue models (see Figs. 8 and 9). Also, the rotation of the stress field and of the \n\nmaximum compressive stress in the corner zone (see Fig. 11B \u2013 MOD1) agrees with the \n\ndescribed geometry and kinematics of early formed (inner) faults in the analogue \n\nmodels, specifically with their steepness and dominant-transcurrent oblique kinematics \n\n(see F3 and F4 in Fig. 9A and cross section 4).   \n\n Besides the corner zone, the obtained stress and strain contours also show a \n\npreferable concentration parallel to the direction of the thrust-fault, both in its footwall \n\nat the bottom of the model (Figs. 11 and 13 MOD 1, Z=6000m), and in its hanging wall \n\nat model surface, corresponding to a wider distribution in this case (Figs. 11 and 13, \n\nMOD 1, Z=0m). In the footwall, this is compatible with the expected site of nucleation \n\nof a new forethrust at depth, which also complies with the obtained analogue results, \n\nwhereas in the hanging wall the stress-strain wider distribution could result from the \n\ncombined effect of backthrust nucleation and outer-arc extension, associated to some \n\ndegree of fold-thrusting in the hanging wall. The plot of the locations where the brittle \n\nfailure criterion was first exceeded in MOD1 also confirms these assumptions, showing \n\n\n\na narrow strip corresponding to the potential forethrust rupture zone in the footwall at \n\ndepth (Fig. 12, MOD1, z=6000m), and a wider band that could correspond to the more \n\ndistributed rupture area accommodating outer-arc extension in the hanging wall at \n\nmodel surface (see Fig. 12, MOD1, z=0m).  \n\n \n\n5.2.2. MOD2  \n\n The fact that the prescribed strike-slip fault in MOD2 does not breach out at the \n\nmodel surface, ending at the top of the interbedded soft later (at 1.5 km depth, Fig. \n\n10D), explains the (almost complete) absence of a corner effect in this case, since it \n\nprevents the stress and strain from concentrating in the corner zone area above the \n\nstrike-slip fault (see Figs. 11 and 13, MOD2 at Z=0m). Instead, stress and strain are \n\npreferably concentrated along a deformation (shear) band, coincident with the direction \n\nof the underlying strike-slip fault. The plot of the location where brittle rupture initiates \n\nalso confirms the absence of corner zone rupture at the model surface, showing it is \n\npreferable expected to occur along the strike-slip fault direction (see Fig. 12, MOD2, \n\nZ=0m).  \n\n At the base of the soft layer, although strain concentration along the strike-slip \n\ndirection is also apparent, a strain delocalization effect clearly occurs in the area \n\ncorresponding to the footwall of plate A (Fig. 13, MOD2, Z=3000m). Such strain \n\ndelocalization is determined by the (soft) rheological response of the interbedded layer \n\nthat manifests by the hindering of fault nucleation and propagation.  \n\n At the base of MOD2 the corner effect, which is practically absent at model \n\nsurface, persists (Figs. 11, 12 and 13, MOD2, Z= 6000m), since here the existent strike-\n\nslip fault favors stress concentration and strain accumulation the corner zone. \n\n \n\n\n\n5.3. Comparison with the natural example and tectonic implications \n\n \n\n The morphotectonic interpretation of the HAP corner zone area, based on the \n\navailable bathymetry and MCS reflection dataset, revealed a natural structural pattern \n\nconsistent with the one obtained in the analogue modeling experiments (Fig. 14). \n\nSimilarities between the model and natural example are mostly represented by faults \n\nexhibiting matching particular geometries and kinematics. Such model-prototype \n\ncongruence shows that the observed natural tectonic pattern was not formed randomly, \n\nbut instead corresponds to what is to be expected for the described thrust-wrench \n\ninterference between the SWM 1 and Horseshoe faults. \n\n The modeled interdependency between both these fault systems, agrees with a \n\npossible multi-rupture scenario involving coeval strike-slip faulting in the wrenching \n\ndomain (SWIM system), reverse-faulting in the thrust domain (Horseshoe system), and \n\nsequentially induced oblique, dextral-reverse faulting in corner zone (SWIM 1 \u2013 HTF \n\nintersection). Multi-rupture scenarios have been documented in other places involving \n\ndominant transcurrent continental fault-systems, in which main strike-slip earthquakes \n\ntrigger thrust-related aftershocks, generally nucleating in restraining bends subsidiary of \n\nthe main transcurrent system (e.g. Gobi-Altay fault and San Andreas fault, Bayarsayhan \n\net al., 1996, Kurushin et al., 1997). Although also in continental domains, wrench-thrust \n\ninterference faulting is likewise known to be associated to complex rupture, comprising \n\ntriggering of thrust faulting only tens of seconds after strike-slip faulting (e.g. 1976 \n\nTangshan earthquake, Butler et al., 1979). In the Gulf of Cadiz, multi-rupture associated \n\nto some kind of interference between different faults (e.g. the HTF, MPF and SWIM) \n\nhas also been generically proposed by previous authors (e.g. Gr\u00e0cia et al., 2003a,b; \n\nTerrinha et al., 2003, 2009). Specifically in the present case, and given the dimension of \n\n\n\nthe faults at stake, rupture areas associated to the corresponding earthquakes could \n\nhardly justify the energy release implied by high magnitude events (M>8.5), such as the \n\n1755 Great Lisbon Earthquake (Gutscher et al., 2009b). Nonetheless, the potential \n\nmulti-rupture associated to the study thrust-wrench tectonic interference should be taken \n\ninto consideration while addressing seismic hazards for low to moderate magnitude \n\nevents (up to M7). \n\n In the study area, recent reports on the local seismicity corresponding to these \n\nlow to moderate magnitude events (Geissler et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2010) showed a \n\nstrong concentration in the SWIM1-HTF corner zone (see Fig. 6). However, it should \n\nbe noted that these earthquakes are located at depths mostly comprised between 40 and \n\n55 km, corresponding to the base of the seismogenic layer (within lithospheric mantle), \n\nwhilst in the available MCS profiles corner faults are imaged at maximum depths of \n\napproximately 6km: one order of magnitude below (e.g. CF1 and CF2 in Fig. 5). It is \n\nthus difficult to envisage a direct connection between these faults, imaged at upper \n\ncrustal depths, and the reported seismicity originated at lithospheric mantle depths. \n\nNonetheless, it should be noted that the great majority of these earthquakes is \n\nconcentrated ~14 and ~25km to the SE of CF1 and CF2 corner faults, respectively (see \n\nFig. 6) in an area closer to the intersection between the SWIM1 and Horseshoe faults. \n\nSuch earthquake location would comply with a southeastwards dip of CF1 and CF2 \n\nfaults of about 74\u00ba and 62\u00ba respectively, admitting the unlikely possibility that they \n\ncould prolong 40-50km downwards to the lithospheric mantle without being \n\nsignificantly deflected. Even so, the mentioned fault steepness qualitatively agrees with \n\nthe interpretation proposed for these structures in the MCS profiles (see Fig. 5), and is \n\nalso compatible with their interpreted dominant transcurrent oblique kinematics. In spite \n\nof the seemingly congruence regarding these aspects, no direct evidence exists at this \n\n\n\npoint to support that these corner structures correspond to translithospheric, or even \n\ndeep seated faults, as is the case of the SWIM 1 and the HTF. As a result, it is more \n\nlikely that the studied thrust-wrench interference corner effect recognized in the upper-\n\ncrust could also exist at deeper lithospheric levels. Accordingly, a replication of the \n\nsame tectonic interference pattern would occur at different depths, in different \n\nlithospheric layers with similar bulk rheology, under the same regional (tectonic) stress \n\nconstraints. This is seemingly supported by the congruency between the variable \n\norientation of the seismically imaged faults (at upper crustal depths), and the variation \n\nof planes deduced from focal mechanisms (at mantle lithospheric depths). These same \n\nfocal mechanisms were also reported as somewhat heterogeneous by Geissler et al. \n\n(2010), although mostly compatible with reverse and strike-slip faulting. Such \n\nheterogeneity agrees with the modeled thrust-wrench tectonic scenario as shown by the \n\nobtained interference structural pattern in the analogue models, where corner zone faults \n\nassume evolving different geometries and kinematics (see Figs. 8 and 9). Geissler et al. \n\n(2010) also report the direction of the principal stress components, based on the \n\nestimated average stress tensors consistent with observed fault slip orientations. \n\nAccording to this, the maximum compressive stress rotates from an approximately E-W \n\ndirection, near the northern termination of the HTF (?1 at N103\u00baE/26\u00ba strike/plunge), to \n\na more N-S direction in the corner zone (?1 at N351\u00ba/12\u00ba), roughly bisecting the angle \n\nbetween the SWIM 1 and the Horseshoe Thrust Fault (see ?1 in Fig. 6). This rotation \n\ncomplies, not only with the corner zone rotation of the maximum compressive stress \n\nobtained for MOD1 numerical results (see Fig. 11B, MOD1), but also with the \n\norientation of the characteristic oblique corner faults, observed both in the analogue \n\nmodel and natural structural patterns (see Figs. 8, 9 and 14). \n\n\n\n The idea that the same thrust-wrench tectonic interference can manifest in a \n\ndecoupled manner at different (crustal and mantle) lithospheric depths, could explain \n\nthe recurrently recognized spatial discrepancy in the Gulf of Cadiz between: (a) the \n\nmapped main tectonic structures, possible associated to high magnitude earthquakes, \n\nand (b) the dominant low to intermediate ?background? seismicity (up to M7), to which \n\nspecific faults are generally difficult to ascribe. \n\n Such a decoupling is also illustrated at a different scale, in the upper crust, by \n\nMOD2 numerical modeling results (see Figs. 11, 12 and 13), which show that an \n\ninterbedded soft layer can be responsible for some degree of strain delocalization, \n\nhindering the propagation of faults, and thus inhibiting the morphological expression of \n\nthe fault interference pattern in the corner zone area. This could explain the poor \n\nbathymetric expression of the corner zone structural pattern in the HAP seafloor, caused \n\nby a soft-like rheological behavior of the Late Miocene ?Chaotic Body? unit determined \n\nby its postulated olistostromic nature. \n\n \n\n6. Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe following main conclusions are drawn: \n\n \n\na) The detailed newly mapped tectonic pattern, observed in the intersection area (corner \n\nzone) between the SWIM 1 fault and the Horseshoe thrust, formed as the result of the \n\ntectonic interference between correspondent active strike-slip and thrust faulting, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n\n\nb) Modeling results show that dextral strike-faulting in the SWIM wrenching domain \n\npromotes reverse faulting in the Horseshoe frontal-thrust domain, and sequentially \n\n(dextral-reverse) oblique faulting in the (corner) zone of intersection between both main \n\nfaults. Results show that in the corner zone domain a preferred concentration of stress \n\nand strain occurs (corner effect), and is mainly accommodated by oblique faulting, \n\nalthough faults exhibit different evolving geometries and matching kinematics as they \n\nendure some degree of rotation.  \n\n \n\nc) In view of the present results, a multi-rupture scenario, within the active tectonic \n\nframework of the connected SWIM 1 and the HTF systems can be envisaged, and \n\nshould be carefully considered in assessing the seismic-related hazards of low to \n\nmoderate seismicity (up to M7) in the Gulf of Cadiz region. \n\n \n\nd) In the SWIM 1- HTF corner zone the tectonic pattern is seismically imaged at upper \n\ncrustal depths, whereas the local seismicity is reported to preferentially occur in the \n\nlithospheric mantle (Geissler et al., 2010). Nonetheless, faults and seismicity data are \n\ncongruent in a number of aspects (orientation of fault planes and planes deduced from \n\nfocal mechanisms, fault kinematics and focal mechanisms, compatibility with similar \n\nstress filed orientation). This suggests the possibility of a decoupled manifestation of the \n\nsame thrust-wrench tectonic interference at different lithospheric depths, which would \n\nexplain the recurrently observed discrepancy between the mapped main tectonic \n\nstructures in the Gulf of Cadiz, that could originate high magnitude earthquakes, and the \n\nexistent low to intermediate seismicity (up to M7). \n\n \n\n\n\ne) Numerical modeling results also illustrate the influence that rheological stratigraphy \n\nmight exert on the nucleation and propagation of the corner zone fault pattern in the \n\nupper crust. Specifically, an interbedded soft layer is shown to inhibit the stress-strain \n\ncorner zone concentration in the overlying competent layer. In accordance, the mild \n\nmorphological (bathymetric) expression of the corner zone interference tectonic pattern \n\nin the HAP seafloor, can be explain by strain delocalization, and consequent hinder of \n\nfault propagation, induced by a soft rheological response of the Late Miocene ?Chaotic? \n\nunit.  \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\n \n\nExperiments were performed in the Analogue Modeling Lab of Instituto Dom Luiz \n\n(IDL), a research Associate Laboratory funded by FCT.

According to the scale model theory (Hubbert, 1937), proper scaling is \n\nachieved when the ratios ?, ? and ? between model and natural prototype are \n\nindependently established for the three fundamental units of length (L), time (T) and \n\nmass (M), respectively: \n\n \n\n   \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n     \n\n \n\nwhere ( ) stands for model and ( ) for natural prototype. The Coulomb fracture \n\ncriterion governs time independent deformation of brittle materials, since yield stress is \n\ninsensitive to the rate of deformation provided that the inertial forces are negligible, as \n\nin the present case. Thus,   ratio is redundant for the present scaling. Length ratio ( ) \n\nwas chosen given the dimensions of the employed deformation apparatus (see section \n\n3.1.2 and Fig. 7) as         . Of the two relevant material properties, coefficient of \n\ninternal friction (  ) and cohesion (  ), the first is dimensionless, and approximately the \n\nsame in both model and prototype (see Table 1), whereas the second has dimension of \n\nstress and thus must be scaled accordingly (Hubbert, 1937): \n\n \n\n  \n     \n\n     \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n      \n\n \n\nwhere   and   are the model/prototype ratio for stress and for acceleration respectively. \n\nSince inertial forces are negligible when compared with gravity, \n\n\n\n \n\n     \n \n\n   \n\n \n   \n\n \n \n\n  \n       \n\n \n\nwhere    is the model/prototype gravity acceleration ratio. Thus, substituting     in \n\nequation (3) allows the following simplification: \n\n \n\n  \n     \n\n     \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n \n         \n\n \n\nwhere   corresponds to the model/prototype density ratio. Substituting   and   in \n\nequation (5) by the respective values of Table 1, immediately allows the determination \n\nof the implied mass ratio             . It should also be noted that since   is \n\ngenerally close to one (between 0.5 and 0.7, e.g. Withjack et al., 2007) the strength of \n\nthe materials expressed by   is scaled with the lengh ( ). Given the fact that in the \n\npresent case          and since cohesion for upper crustal rocks is clearly typically \n\nless than 50 MPa, it becomes immediately evident the utility of model materials with \n\nvery low cohesion (<100Pa), such as dry quartz sand, as analogues of upper crustal \n\nrocks.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAbe, K., 1979.
