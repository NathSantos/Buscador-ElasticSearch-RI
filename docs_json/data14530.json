One important characteristic of the\nOMZ is the presence of distinguishable\nstructural, paleogeographic and magmatic-\nmetamorphic domains, as recognized by\nChac\u00f3n et al. (1983), Apalategui et al. (1990)\nand Oliveira et al., (1991). In the western Ossa-\nMorena Zone exists a large area covering\napproximately 75 km2 (the \u00c9vora Massif; e.g.\n\nCarvalhosa, 1983; Quesada and Munh\u00e1, 1990)\nwhere the magmatism and high-grade\nmetamorphism related with the Variscan\norogeny is well exposed. Recently, with the\npurpose of clarifying the complex internal\nstructure of the \u00c9vora Massif, Pereira et al.\n(2003) defined the \u00c9vora High-Grade\nMetamorphic Terrains (EHMT) as a major\ntectonic unit composed by a complex\nassemblage of migmatites and gneisses,\nintruded by syn-orogenic basic to acid\nplutonic rocks and late-orogenic\nporphyritic granites. The same authors\ninterpret these high-grade metamorphic rocks\nas the result of Variscan HT-LP metamorphism\n\ndeveloped over Neoproterozoic (Serie Negra)\nand Lower Palaeozoic rocks.\n\nThe Hospitais Massif (Carvalhosa and\nZbyszweski, 1994) occupies the northwest\nend of the EHMT, close to the town of\nMontemor-o-Novo, and it corresponds to a\ntonalitic body with an elliptical shape (15km\nlong x 6km width) oriented sub-parallel to the\nregional Variscan foliation (WNW-ESE\nstriking deformation fabrics) in the region. The\ntonalitic pluton intrudes mainly gneisses and\nmigmatites, except in its northern boundary,\nwhere it contacts a prominent amphibolitic\nlayer. To the west, Tertiary sediments cover\nboth tonalites and country rocks.\n\n\n\n52\n\nGabbroic rocks occur within the\nEHMT, as several WNW-ESE elongated\nbodies (Fig.1), intrusive in the gneissic-\nmigmatitic complex. Their lengths usually\nfall between several hundred meters and\nfew kilometres.\n\nField relations and Petrography\n\nThis work is focused on the following\nrock types: (1) tonalite, constituting the\nmain lithology of the Hospitais Massif\n(HM); (2) leucotonalitic layers, locally\nintercalated in the former lithology; (3)\nmicrogranular dioritic enclaves hosted by\nthe tonalite; (4) gabbros, forming small\nintrusions in the EHMT, but outside the\nHospitais Massif.\n\nMain tonalite\nThe dominant tonalite in the Hospitais\n\nMassif is monotonous, with small\npetrographic variation. Texturally, it is\nhypidiomorphic granular and shows medium\nto coarse grain size. A WNW-ESE foliation,\ndefined by the alignment of mafic minerals\n(biotite and amphibole), is often observed\n(Fig.2). Concerning the mineralogy, the\ndominant phases in the tonalite are plagioclase\n(40-50%) and quartz (20-30%), whereas the\nferromagnesian silicates do not exceed 20 to\n\n30% of rock volume. The relative proportions\nof amphibole and biotite are quite variable\nfrom sample to sample: either one or the other\nmay be the most important mafic phase. The\nmost common accessory minerals are apatite,\noxides, zircon and allanite.\n\nPlagioclase has composition of\nandesine and forms subhedral grains\n(length: 2-4 mm) that commonly display\neither continuous or discontinuous complex\nzoning (Fig. 3A). Sometimes, these grains\ncontain inclusions of sub-millimetric\ncorroded plagioclase crystals. Another\nessential felsic mineral is quartz, whose\ngrains are always anhedral with contours\nadapting to the forms of plagioclase, biotite\nand amphibole. Wavy extinction and/or\nsubgranulation reveal that quartz was\nsubmitted to recovery processes.\n\nTwo types of amphibole - hornblende\nand cummingtonite, typically in close\nassociation (Fig. 3B)- may be found in the\ntonalite. Hornblende is systematically\npresent and is one of the most important\nmafic phases, whilst cummingtonite occurs\nin a highly variable proportion between\nsamples, from almost absent to 20-30% of total\namphibole. Typically, amphibole grains are 2-\n4 mm long and have subhedral forms. When\nthe two amphiboles are present, they associate\nto each other, with the hornblende rimming the\n\ncummingtonite. Occasionally, the biggest\ncrystals of amphibole develop a poikilitic\ntexture, including small euhedral and\nsubhedral crystals of plagioclase, oxides\nand apatite. The other major mafic mineral\n\u2013 biotite - forms subhedral crystals, whose\nmaximum length sometimes achieves 6\nmm, and commonly envelops opaques and\napatite.\n\nConsidering the accessory phases, their\nmost significant features are the following:\nopaque minerals are commonly spatially\nrelated to the main mafic minerals, showing\neuhedral and subhedral shapes; apatite\nforms small (tenths of mm) euhedral\nprismatic crystals; zircon was almost\nalways observed as euhedral grains with\nhundredths or tenths of mm; allanite was\nfound only sporadically, as anhedral to\nsubhedral grains hosted by amphibole or\nbiotite.\n\nAlthough primary minerals are usually\nwell preserved in the collected samples,\nplagioclase may contain sericite, whereas\nbiotite is occasionally replaced by chlorite\nplus epidote.\n\nLeucotonalitic Layers\nLocally, it is possible to observe some\n\ncentimetric layers impoverished in mafic\nphases (Leucotonalitic Layers \u2013 LTL, Fig.\n2B) that are commonly parallel or slightly\noblique to the foliation, although they also\ncan be seen, rarely, cutting that structure.\nWithin these discordant layers, it is possible\nto identify an internal fabric defined by the\nalignment of undeformed grains of mafic\nminerals and feldspars.\n\nAt the two existing quarries in the\nHospitais Massif, there is a vertical\nmagmatic layering characterized by the\nalternation of (1) bands of particularly\nquartz-rich and mafic-poor tonalite, and (2)\nlevels with modal composition similar to\nthat of the main tonalite.\n\nMafic enclaves\nDark-coloured enclaves, displaying\n\nwell-rounded outlines, ovoid forms and sharp\nlimits, occur sparingly within the main\ntonalite. They show variable dimensions, from\n2 to 40 cm long and from 0.5 to 6 cm wide, and\nrepresent, when present, a small percentage of\nthe outcrop area: 1-2% and sometimes less.\nMineralogically, all the studied enclaves show\ndominance of amphibole. Two petrographic\ngroups based on the type of the amphibole,\nrelative volume of ferromagnesian minerals\nand granularity were defined: hornblendic\nenclaves (HbE) and cummingtonitic-\nhornblendic enclaves (Cm-HbE).\n\nThe HbE enclaves are medium-grained\n(2mm) and have a hypidiomorphic granular\ntexture. Modally, they may be classified as\n\nFig. 1.- a) Geological sketch map of the \u00c9vora Massif located at the westernmost domains of the\nOssa-Morena Zone (OMZ). b) Simplified geological map of the \u00c9vora Massif with the subdivision in\ntwo major tectonic units: the \u00c9vora high-grade Metamorphic Terrains (EHMT) and the Montemor-o-\n\nNovo Shear Zone (MNSZ), with location of tonalites from the Hospitais massif; After Pereira et al.,\n2003 (\u00e9location of samples that were studied for geochemistry analysis by Moita et al., this volume)\n\nFig. 1.- a) Esquema geol\u00f3gico con la localizaci\u00f3n del Macizo de \u00c9vora en los dom\u00ednios occidentales\nde la Zona de Ossa-Morena (OMZ). b) Mapa geol\u00f3gico simplificado del Macizo de \u00c9vora con la subdivi-\nsi\u00f3n en los Terrenos Metam\u00f3rficos de Alto-grado de \u00c9vora (EHMT) y la Zona de Cizalla de Montemor-o-\n\nNovo (MNSZ), con la localizaci\u00f3n de las tonalitas del Macizo de Hospitais; Modificado de Pereira et al.,\n2003 (localizaci\u00f3n de las muestras analizadas en el estudio geoqu\u00edmico por Moita et al., en este volumen).\n\n\n\n53\n\ndiorites: hornblende is the most important\nmineral (40-50%), followed by plagioclase\n(30-50%) and quartz (5%). Cummingtonite\nis characteristically absent, but, sometimes,\nhornblende shows mimetic features\n(specially \u201cghosts\u201d of a previous fine\ntwinning) after the ferromagnesian\namphibole. Hornblende occurs as euhedral/\nsubhedral crystals (~ 2mm) occasionally\ncontaining plagioclase, apatite and opaque\ninclusions. When in contact with\nplagioclase, amphibole grains tend to adapt\nto the feldspar contours. Crystals of\nplagioclase (andesine-labradorite) typically\nexhibit subhedral forms and display\ncomplex continuous zoning. The oxide\nminerals have subhedral habit and, in some\nsamples, reach 4-5% of the mode. In these\nenclaves, biotite occurs in small amounts,\nbut it may show a poikilitic development.\nQuartz is anhedral with lamellar\nsubgranulation.\n\nThe Cm-HbE enclaves are\ndistinguished from the previous type\nmainly by (1) the significant amounts of\nboth amphiboles (hornblende and\ncummingtonite), (2) the seriate texture with\ndominance of relatively small grains\n(<2mm) and (3) the systematic presence, as\nan accessory phase, of biotite. These\nenclaves have modal compositions typical\nof diorites or microdiorites, since\nplagioclase (50-60%) and amphibole (30-\n35%) are largely dominant. Quartz (~5%)\nand biotite (1-2%) are other significant\nphases, whilst opaques and apatite only\noccur in very small amounts. Plagioclase\n(labradorite) grains are anhedral and their\ndimensions vary from 0.5 to 1-2mm (rarely\n4mm).

In several cases, well\ndeveloped plagioclase preserve cores that\nseem to have been reworked. Amphiboles\nare usually present in aggregates of small\n(usually, less than 250\u00ecm in length) and\nirregularly shaped grains. In those sets of\ncrystals, both hornblende and\ncummingtonite are present, in a proportion\nof approximately 60:40, and the\nferromagnesian amphibole is confined to a\ncentral position. Biotite is a subordinate\nphase occurring as small and elongated\ngrains; it is occasionally replaced by\nchlorite and epidote. The crystals of\napatite, characteristically euhedral and\nelongated (axial ratios 3:1 - 5:1 and some\nacicular), are usually associated with the\nfelsic minerals. Quartz is anhedral with\nlamellar subgranulation and opaques are\nmanly associated with the felsic minerals.\n\nFig. 2.- Field relations within Hospitais Massif: A) Elliptic flattened enclaves parallel with the\nmain tonalitic foliation, B) Development of LTL, cutting the tonalitc foliation, C) Development\n\nof a LTH around the microgranular mafic enclave\n\nFig. 2.- Relaciones de campo en el Macizo de Hospitais: A) Enclaves el\u00edpticos y aplastados\nparalelos con la foliaci\u00f3n principal de la tonalita, B) Desarrollo de LTL cortando la foliaci\u00f3n de\nla tonalita, C) Desarrollo de LTH en el borde de un enclave dior\u00edtico contenido en las tonalitas.\n\n\n\n54\n\nLeucotonalitic halos\nSurrounding the mafic enclaves it is\n\nsometimes possible to observe 1-3cm thick\nleucotonalitic halos (LTH) (Fig.2C). The\ngrain size of the halo is similar to that of the\nhost tonalite. The felsic minerals\n(plagioclase and quartz) strongly\npredominate, whereas the mafic phases\n(hornblende \u00b1 cummingtonite \u00b1 biotite)\nrepresent only 5% of the modal\ncomposition. Zircon occurs as an important\naccessory phase. Plagioclase shows\ncomplex and discontinuous zoning, as well\nas some deformation features like wedge\ntwinning. The quartz is more abundant in\nthe halos than in the surrounding tonalite\nand shows lamellar subgranulation.\n\nMafic rocks\nGabbros occur as small isolated outcrops\n\nwith no direct contact with the HM. They are\npredominantly medium grained rocks with\nhypidiomorphic granular textures, but, in\nsome cases, poikilitic textures developed.\nBrown hornblende (30-40%), clinopyroxene\n(20-30%) and plagioclase (30-40%) are the\nessential minerals, whilst opaques and\napatite are the accessory phases. The\namphibole commonly envelops the other\nprimary minerals, especially plagioclase, and\nit may constitute oikocrysts (reaching 5mm).\nPyroxene is present as isolated corroded\nnuclei (0.25-0.5mm) inside amphibole or as\neuhedral crystals (0.25-1mm) when\nassociated with plagioclase. The grains of\ncalco-sodic feldspar (labradorite-bytownite)\nare usually subhedral and variable in size:\ncrystals inside hornblende are small, from\n0.25mm to 0.5mm with round edges, while\noutside they may be up to 2mm long. Apatite\nconstitutes anhedral grains, although\nsometimes elongated, reaching 0.5mm. The\nopaque grains have usually round contours and\nsmall dimensions, and are mainly included in\namphibole. Comparatively with the others\nlithologies, the mafic rocks exhibit more often\nthe development of secondary minerals, namely\ngrowth of sericite, inside plagioclase, and\nactinolite, at hornblende and pyroxene\nexpenses.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Hospitais Massif is a Variscan syn-\ntectonic plutonic body that comprises\nmedium-grained tonalites with\nleucotonalitic layers and microgranular\nenclaves. These enclaves have typical\nigneous compositions and are sometimes\nsurrounded by hololeucocratic halos.\nOutside this massif, but in the same sector\nof the \u00c9vora High-Grade Metamorphic\nTerrains, several minor gabbroic syn-\ntectonic intrusions can be found. This\n\nspatial and chronological association\nsuggests that the gabbros, the mafic\nenclaves and the different tonalitic facies\nmay represent the primitive and\nintermediate terms of a cogenetic igneous\nsuite, as will be discussed in the companion\npaper (Moita et al., this volume), formed\nduring the Variscan orogeny.\n\nThe tonalites present magmatic fabrics\nassociated with a moderately developed\nfoliation, recording syntectonic\ncrystallization and cooling, co-planar to\nsteep foliations observed within the\nsurrounding sheared gneisses and\nmigmatites. Locally, it is possible to\nobserve LTL commonly parallel or slightly\noblique to the foliation with internal fabric\ndefined by the alignment of undeformed\ngrains of mafic minerals.\n\nThe enclaves display well-rounded\noutlines, ellipsoidal forms (with maximum\naxes sub-parallel to the foliation of\ntonalites) and sharp limits. These structural\ncharacteristics suggest that they were\nformed when the crystallization of the\nmagma was not complete, but then they\nwere affected by strain in a progressive\ndeformation process. In fact, the fabric\ndisplayed by tonalites seems to be of\nmagmatic origin and controlled by regional\ndeformation since some microstructures\ndeveloped on feldspars, biotite and quartz\nare possible to observe.\n\nIn some places, there are discordant\nLTL with an internal foliation oblique to the\nfoliation of the main tonalite, implying that,\nat some point during the crystallization of\nthe tonalite, tensional stress-originated\nfractures immediately replenished with the\nremaining magma, after which shearing\ncontinued to deform both lithologies.\n\nField relationships reveal that\ncrystallization and cooling of the main\ntonalites and gabbros are synchronous with\n\nprogressive shearing of the gneisses and\nmigmatites envelope, with both intrusion\nand country rock showing steep fabrics sub-\nparallel to regional Variscan structures.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nSupported by the project MODELIB\n35630/99-Termocronologia e Modela\u00e7\u00e3o\nTectonometam\u00f3rfica na Cadeia Varisca\nIb\u00e9rica, SAPIENS Proj99 FCT, the Grupo\nde Tect\u00f3nica \u2013 Centro de Geof\u00edsica de\n\u00c9vora budget for 2003-2004.
