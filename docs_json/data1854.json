Tendo como base o Modelo do G\u00e9nero em Contexto (Deaux &amp; Major, 1987) e a Teoria de Foco na Conduta Normativa (Cialdini, Reno, &amp; Kallgren, 1990; Cialdini, Kallgren, &amp; Reno, 1991), pretendemos investigar de que forma a conformidade \u00e0s normas de g\u00e9nero, particularmente as da masculinidade hegem\u00f3nica, influenciam o consumo de carne, fruta e vegetais de homens e mulheres, e em que medida contextos em que o g\u00e9nero se encontra saliente influenciam esta rela\u00e7\u00e3o.

Literature shows that there are sex-related differences in their adoption; however, sex is not the only explaining factor, with gender playing a vital role in this relation. Drawing upon the Gender in Context Model (Deaux &amp; Major, 1987) and the Focus Theory of Normative Conduct (Cialdini, Reno, &amp; Kallgren, 1990; Cialdini, Kallgren, &amp; Reno, 199), we aimed to investigate how conformity to gender norms, particularly hegemonic masculinity norms, influenced men's and women's meat, vegetables and fruit consumption, and how gender-salient contexts moderated this relation. We also aimed to test if sex-related differences in these foods' consumption were mediated by the conformity to hegemonic masculinity norms. In a quasi-experimental between-subjects design, 519 participants completed the Portuguese version of the Conformity to Masculinity Norms Inventory, and answered questions about their past week's meat, fruit and vegetable consumption; additionally, half of the participants received a message designed to manipulate gender salience while the other half did not. Our hypotheses were partially confirmed; the relationship between the conformity to masculinity norms and food consumption was moderated by gender salience, and sex-related differences in food consumption were partially mediated by the conformity to masculinity norms. Therefore, this study showed that gender is an explaining factor of food consumption patterns of men and women, both through conformity to gender norms, and through contexts were gender is salient.\nKeywords: Gender, Masculinities, Stereotypes, Norms, Food Consumption\nPsycINFO Codes:\n3020 Group &amp; Interpersonal Processes 3360 Health Psychology &amp; Medicine\nContents\nChapter 1 - Introduction............................................................1\nl.l.Sex differences in food consumption...........................................1\n1.2.\tGender differences in food consumption.......................................2\n1.2.1.\tDistinguishing sex and gender............................................3\n1.2.2.\tHow gender influences food consumption...................................4\n1.2.3.\tMasculinities and food consumption.......................................8\n1.3.\tAims and Hypotheses..........................................................9\nChapter II - Method................................................................12\n2.1.\tParticipants................................................................12\n2.2.\tDesign and Independent Variables............................................12\n2.3.\tInstruments.................................................................13\n2.3.1.\tConformity to Hegemonic Masculinity Norms...............................13\n2.3.2.\tMeat intake.............................................................14\n2.3.3.\tFruit and vegetable intake..............................................14\n2.4.\tProcedure ................................................................. 14\n2.5.\tData Analyses...............................................................15\nChapter III - Results..............................................................17\n3.1.\tManipulation Check..........................................................17\n3.2.\tDescriptive Statistics......................................................17\n3.2.1.\tSex differences in the Conformity to Masculinity Norms and Food\nConsumption....................................................................19\n3.3.\tCorrelations between adherence to masculinity norms and food consumption....20\n3.4.\tModeration analysis.........................................................21\n3.5.\tMediation analysis..........................................................23\nChapter IV - Discussion............................................................25\n4.1.\tLimitations and future\tresearch.............................................27\nReferences.........................................................................29\nAppendix A.........................................................................35\nIndex of Tables\nTable 1 - Descriptive statistics and normality tests of the variables for the total sample.18\nTable 2 - Sex-related differences in the CMNI dimension and food consumption patterns ... 20\nTable 3 - Correlations between CMNI dimensions and food consumption variables in the\nmen's sample by gender salience conditions.................................................21\nTable 4 - Correlations between CMNI dimensions and food consumption variables in the women's sample.......................................................................... 21\nTable of Figures\nFigure 1 - Conceptual model of the moderation of gender salience on the relation between conformity to masculinity norms and meat, fruit and vegetable consumption...............10\nFigure 2 - Conformity to masculinity norms as mediator of the relation between participants' sex and their meat, fruit and vegetable consumption.....................................11\nFigure 3 - Moderation effect of gender salience on the relationship between adherence to the\nPlayboy norm and vegetable consumption in the men's sample..............................22\nChapter 1 - Introduction\nNoncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are chronic, non-transmissible illnesses (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease). In 2012, NCDs were responsible for 68% of all deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2016). WHO predicts an increase in this number of deaths if prevention measures are not followed. Despite this, NCDs are largely preventable, as they have as their main risk factors behaviours such as tobacco and harmful alcohol use, physical inactivity and unhealthy diets.\nThis last risk factor includes both high consumption of red and processed meat -suggested to be linked to a higher risk of colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Boada, Henriquez-Hernandez, &amp; Luzardo, 2016) -, and low fruit and vegetable consumption, foods that are considered protective of all the health problems mentioned above (WHO, 2003).\nThese food consumption patterns have a great impact on health; in fact, according to the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health (2015), inadequate eating habits are the leading cause of healthy years lost in Portugal. Unhealthy eating habits are responsible for 19.2% of the loss of healthy years in the Portuguese population (in which low fruit consumption has the most weight, while low vegetable consumption is the third contributor, and processed meat consumption is the fifth).\nGiven the impact of food consumption patterns in health, it becomes important to study the factors that influence their adoption. Consequently, the aim of the present study is to expand the knowledge on psychosocial correlates of food intake, namely, how sex and gender are associated with food consumption. We will start by distinguishing the notions of sex and gender, examining how both concepts can significantly impact people's food consumption patterns. We will then analyse, more specifically, how masculinity norms can affect individuals' consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, which will be the specific focus of the present research.\n1.1.\tSex differences in food consumption\nSex has an important role in food consumption patterns. Studies show that inadequate eating habits are more prevalent in men than in women; men show a greater tendency to eat red meat than women, and are less favourable to a vegetarian diet, stating that \u201chumans are meant to eat meat\u201d (Ruby, 2012, p. 143), and defending that, in order to have a healthy diet, one should eat meat. Women also appear to be more concerned with the ethical aspect of meat\nproduction than men, according to a social survey carried by Beardsworth et al. (2002). Regarding fruit and vegetable consumption, Wardle et al. (2004) analysed sex-related differences in eating behaviour in 23 countries and concluded that women show a greater tendency to eat more fruit, avoid fat and to eat more fibre than men. These differences are also present in the Portuguese population (INE/INSA, 2009), and are observed since a young age -in a Portuguese sample of teenagers, with ages between 10 and 20 years old, the same results were found concerning fruit and vegetable consumption (Matos, Sim\u00f5es, Camacho, Reis, &amp; Equipa Aventura Social, 2015).\nThere are also quantity differences in food consumption between men and women. Generally, men eat more than women (Beer-Borst, 2000; Pliner, Bell, Hirsch, &amp; Kinchla, 2006) and need, on average, a greater amount of calories, since they are typically larger and have more musculature than women (Rolls, Fedoroff, &amp; Guthrie, 1991). However, a study by de Castro (1995) showed that sex is a greater predictor of daily intake than weight and height, which might suggest that these sex-related differences are not only explained by physiological factors, namely, individuals\u2019 body size.\nThere is also evidence that men eat less when stressed, as opposed to women, who report to eat more in stressful situations. For example, Grunberg and Straub (1992) found that, in a stressful condition (viewing a movie about industrial accidents) men ate significantly less, independently of the food type - \u201csweet, salty or bland\u201d (Grunberg &amp; Straub, 1992, p. 98). In contrast, when analysing women\u2019s food intake, although there were no statistically significant differences between the stress and the control conditions, the authors noted a tendency for an increase in the consumption of sweet and bland foods.\nIn sum, there is now some evidence suggesting the presence of sex-related differences in food consumption patterns; generally, men eat more quantities and have a greater tendency to eat red meat, and women tend to eat more fruits and vegetables. However, as we have pointed out, these differences might not exclusively be dependent on physiological aspects, and can also be accounted for by psychosocial factor, namely, gender issues.\npresent themselves\u201d (Bernardes, Keogh, &amp; Lima, 2008, p. 428). Thus, in order to better understand the role of sex and gender on food consumptions patterns, these concepts should be differentiated.\n1.2.1. Distinguishing sex and gender. Mixing sex and gender seems rather restrictive when trying to understand behaviours. Sex is described as the result of genetics and biology; a person is defined as male or female depending on his/her pairs of chromosomes, or the biological and physical characteristics resulting from them - such as differences in the reproductive or hormonal systems (external genitalia, gonads and secondary sex characteristics). Therefore, this description is largely based on the biomedical model, putting aside the psychological and social aspects that are enrolled in the categorization of individuals, by rooting these differences between men and women in biology (Bernardes, Keogh &amp; Lima, 2008; West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987). Moreover, as Bernardes, Keogh &amp; Lima, 2008) noted \"(...) the sex category a person is placed in does not necessarily correspond to their biological sex\" (p. 428), as is the case of, for example, transsexuals or intersexes. In other words, this separation of the biological and psychological/social aspects \"(...) leaves tremendous areas of behavior, feelings, thoughts and fantasies that are related to the sexes and yet do not have primarily biological connotations\" (Stoller, 1968, preface, p.6).\nGender, on the other hand, is a social construction. West and Zimmerman have supported this idea, stating that \"(...) rather than as a property of individuals, we conceive of gender as an emergent feature of social situations\" (1987, p. 126). As Am\u00e2ncio (1992), summarizes, gender can be defined as specific representations (common knowledge) about what it is to be a man and to be a woman, the norms that rule women's and men's behaviours and their roles; these representations vary according to the culture, and are based on socialization. Gender is, accordingly, \u201cperformed\u201d (McCreary &amp; Chrisler, 2010, p.1).\nIn a nutshell, gender is not a synonym for sex; they can be relatively independent constructs, since gender refers to the psychological and social aspects of sex (Bernardes, Keogh &amp; Lima, 2008; Deaux, 1985) or, in other words, the \"(...) nonphysiological components of sex that are culturally regarded as appropriate to males or to females\" (Unger, 1979, p. 1086). In fact, and as Unger states, there is a difference \"(...) between maleness and masculinity and femaleness and femininity\" (1979, p. 1086); while the concepts of maleness and femaleness come from biological criteria, Unger defines masculinity and femininity as sociopsychological terms. Likewise, Connell addresses gender as the product of social learning and socialization (Connell, 1995).\nIn sum, sex and gender are different and independent constructs, which need to be disentangled in order to better understand their influence on individuals\u2019 food consumption patterns. If, in the previous section, we have reviewed findings on sex-related differences in food intake, we now turn to the analysis of how gender may influence men\u2019s and women\u2019s food consumption patterns.\n1.2.2. How gender influences food consumption. Gender is a complex and multidimensional construct with several associated concepts, e.g., gender stereotypes, gender identities, gender roles, gender norms, gender performances, gender ideologies (Bernardes, Keogh, &amp; Lima, 2008). It is beyond the scope of this paper to define them all. We will focus exclusively on the gender-related concepts that have been mostly used in the literature to understand food consumption patterns. More specifically, we will first start by defining the concept of gender stereotypes, and analyse studies that relate gender stereotypes to food consumption. We will then examine the concept of gender roles and norms, and explain how contextual cues, namely gender salience, may affect their influence on individuals\u2019 behaviour; lastly, we will present the concept of masculinities and adherence to masculinity norms, on which we will draw upon to conceptually frame the main aims of our study.\n1.2.2.1 Gender stereotypes and food consumption. Gender stereotypes are \u201c(...) generalized preconceptions about the attributes of males and females\u201d (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999, p. 678). Crawford and Unger (2004) point out the social nature of gender stereotypes, mentioning that they are culturally shared. These preconceived ideas are largely based on physiological traits, or on the reproductive systems (McCreary &amp; Chrisler, 2010; Lee &amp; Owens, 2002; West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987). Men are believed to be stronger than women, invulnerable and capable of leadership; women are seen to be gentler and responsible for taking care of the family (McCreary &amp; Chrisler, 2010). We must, again, take into account that society is one of the \u201ccarriers\u201d of these stereotypes, through certain reactions or behaviours towards and around the person, since he or she was a child (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999). But how do gender stereotypes relate to food consumption?\nreaction times were significantly shorter when a presented forename was congruent with the dish associated to a specific gender stereotype. Foods considered congruent with a female forename were \u201ccake, fruit, pudding, ice cream parfait, pasta, and salad\u201d (Kimura et al., 2009, p. 522), while meat dishes were associated with a male forename.\nWith the purpose of studying how the eating behaviour of the eater affects how he/she is perceived, Bock and Kanarek (1995) presented a cover story about a fictitious target, with a male and a female version; it contained, among others, information about the target's food preferences, with the purpose of examining the effect that this information had on the perception of the target. They found that targets who supposedly ate small meals were rated as more typically feminine and less typically masculine that the targets who ate larger meals.\nBasow and Kobrynowicz (1993) filmed the same woman eating four different meals (which varied in size, between small or large, and between more typically feminine -a salad -or more typically masculine foods - a meatball sandwich; these ranks were based on a pretest). After the participants watched one of the films, they had to evaluate her genderstereotypical traits, using an adapted version of the Bem Sex Role Inventory (Bem, 1974). The authors concluded that, when participants watched the woman eating the small typically feminine meal, she was considered more socially appealing.\nStein and Nemeroff (1995) found that judgements about food were moderated by the sex of the eater: food eaten by a male target was rated as healthier and lower in fat than when it was eaten by a female target. The authors relate this finding to the stereotype of male body's invulnerability. Another curious finding of this study was that when the target ate \u201cgood-foods\u201d (a distinction made based on a pilot-study), he or she was rated as \u201cmore feminine, attractive, likable and less masculine\u201d (Stein &amp; Nemeroff, 1995, p. 486), comparing to \u201cbad-food\u201d eaters.\nIn sum, these studies show that stereotypical masculinity is associated with meat and large quantities of food, and stereotypical femininity is associated with small, lighter meals. Moreover, our perceptions of others are influenced by the content and size of the meal, thus highlighting that men and women are perceived differently because the content of gender stereotypes relating to food are different for men and women.\n1.2.2.2.\tGender in context: gender roles, norms and food consumption. As we have seen, gender stereotypes \u201c(...) serve as messengers about the appropriate social roles and behaviors of women and men\u201d (Crawford &amp; Unger, 2004, p. 57). In this sense, gender stereotypes, as all stereotypes conveyed by society, can condition an individual's behaviour,\nsince \u201c(...) stereotypical prescriptions constitute social norms to which men and women are expected to adhere\u201d (Barreto &amp; Ellemers, 2013, p. 290). In line with the Focus Theory of Normative Conduct (Cialdini, Reno, &amp; Kallgren, 1990; Cialdini, Kallgren, &amp; Reno, 1991), gender norms can be descriptive or prescriptive (injuctive). Descriptive norms define how women and men generally are, \u201cwhat is normal\u201d (Wood &amp; Eagly, 2009), while prescriptive norms describe how women and men should be, how they should and should not behave (Diekman &amp; Goodfriend, 2006). Eagly and Karau (2002, p. 574) added that \u201c(...) gender role thus refers to the collection of both descriptive and injunctive expectations associated with women and men\u201d. Moreover, Kallgren, Reno, and Cialdini (2000) concluded that these norms have different influences on action, but only when they are salient - i.e., when they are \u201cfocal in attention\u201d (Cialdini et al., 2006, p. 4), and, thus, brought to consciousness.\nKeeping in mind these theoretical notions, we can look at another perspective of gender\u2019s influence in food intake. Studies have shown that women eat less when paired with a desirable male partner (a contextual variable manipulated in order to make gender salient), so as to look more feminine. The same does not happen to men, who eat less in the presence of women, independently of their attractiveness, presumably, to be polite as Mori, Chaiken and Pliner (1987) suggested. Conversely, men eat more in the presence of other men; Conner and Armitage (2002) have proposed that this happens based on a motivation for competition. However, there is evidence that suggests that men eat more when women are present, as opposed with when other men are present (Sigirci, Kniffin, &amp; Wansink, 2014). These studies reflect the influence of impression-management goals on food intake (Herman, Roth and Polivy, 2003): we use food (and sometimes manipulate food intake) to convey a specific (gendered) impression about ourselves. This can be a possible explanation for why women show more propensity to diet and to lose weight; it can be because of the social pressure to appear thin, and because of the stereotype that feminine women eat little.\nIt is interesting to reflect on these results using Deaux and Major\u2019s model of gender in context (Deaux &amp; Major, 1987). The authors propose that the \u201c(...) enactment of gender primarily takes place within the context of social interaction\u201d which is a \u201c(...) process of identity negotiation whereby perceivers and selves (targets) attempt to attain their interaction goals\u201d (Deaux &amp; Major, 1987, p. 370). Therefore, people\u2019s motivation to behave in a certain way cannot only be resumed to biological or previous socialization components because \u201c(...) behaviors may differ widely as a function of personal choice, the behavior of others, and the situational context\u201d (p. 371). Concern for one\u2019s self presentation may motivate individuals to\nbehave (\u201cfoodwise\u201d) in ways that are congruent with the stereotypes associated with the gender one identifies with.\nSocial norms constitute a role that people are expected to perform (Burr, 1998, cited by Oliveira &amp; Amancio, 2002), and they lead to social sanctions when behaviours are dissonant (Diekman &amp; Goodfriend, 2006; Oliveira &amp; Amancio, 2002). Boys and girls are pressured to conform to gender norms from a young age, suffering social sanction (such as bullying and ostracism) when they do not comply with their gender's norms (Basow, 2010). Furthermore, \u201cboys, who have a stricter gender role than girls do, are more often punished by their peers for perceived gender-role violations\u201d (Basow, 2010, p. 282). However, in line with the gender in context model (Deaux &amp; Major, 1987), gender norms should not be considered independent binary entities (Amancio, 1993), but rather a continuum to which individuals position themselves; individuals may present various degrees of conformity to gender norms, since, as we believe, gender is not static, but is continually constructed (West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987, p. 125).\nAlthough Deaux &amp; Major's gender in context model (1987) seems to have a heuristic value when trying to conceptualize how gender roles and norms may influence men's and women's food consumption patterns, not many studies have drawn upon this theoretical background to do so. Indeed, the previous sections showed that: (1) most authors have focused on describing sex-related differences in food consumption patterns instead of using gender-related concepts to account for such differences; and (2) gender-based research has been more focused on exploring the contents of gender stereotypes and food intake than on investigating how individual differences in the adherence to such gender norms may account for men' and women's food intake behaviour. It is this work's general aim to bridge these gaps in the literature, by investigating the role of individual's adherence to masculinity norms on their food consumption patterns. But, why masculinity norms?\nAs mentioned earlier, men generally are more favourable than women to meat consumption and less to fruit and vegetable consumption, which puts their health at risk. It is, thus, important to understand how gender, particularly masculinity norms, can predict men's (but also women's) food consumption.\n1.2.3. Masculinities and food consumption. Following the idea that gender is dynamic and influenced by the social context, we defend that there are many ways of being a man. However, men suffer social expectations to behave accordingly to the current male stereotype, which they may choose to conform to or not (Mahalik et al., 2003).\nLiterature distinguishes three concepts of masculinity. First, the hegemonic masculinity, viewed as the dominant group; it conceives men as heterosexual, aggressive, physically strong and invincible, capable of overpowering women and other men; however, Connell and Messerschmidt (2005) noted that this is not the statistical norm, since only a few men live up to this standard. It embodies \u201c(...) the currently most honoured way of being a man, it required all other man to position themselves in relation to it, and it ideologically legitimated the global subordination of women to men\u201d (Connell &amp; Messerschmidt, 2005, p. 832). The historic and cultural aspects of this norm need to be noted, as they are social constructions that vary in time and can be replaced by new conceptions.\nThe second notion of masculinity is the one of subordinated masculinity, which refers to any form of being a man that does not fit the standard of hegemonic masculinity. Connell (1997) and Connell and Messerschmidt (2005) used the concept of intersectionality as a means to explain this idea, since it occurs frequently in ethnic or sexual minorities. Subordinated masculinity is \u201c(...) formed at the bottom of the gender hierarchy among men\u201d (Connell, 1997, p. 8)\nThirdly, we have complicit masculinity, that is, the acceptance of the patriarchal system and its benefits, without overtly engaging in any form of oppression. Connell (1997) posits that this is the largest group.\nMahalik et al. (2003) developed an instrument designed to access the degree of conformity to masculinity norms, and found, in an American male's sample, the existence of 11 masculinity norms that correspond to the hegemonic masculinity ideal: Winning, Emotional Control, Risk-taking, Violence, Power over Women, Dominance, Playboy, Selfreliance, Primacy of Work, Disdain for Homosexuals and Pursuit of Status. This study was successfully replicated in other cultures (Cu\u00e9llar-Flores, S\u00e1nchez-L\u00f3pez, &amp; Dresch, 2011; Rochelle &amp; Yim, 2015), including the Portuguese (Leit\u00e3o, 2015) showing that these norms are shared between cultures.\nAgain, men suffer pressures to meet hegemonic masculinity expectations, as well as to dissociate from femininity (O'Neil, Helms, Gable, David, &amp; Wrightsman, 1986). There is, for example, social pressure for men to adopt risky behaviours and to depreciate health-protective behaviours, in order to convey the ideal of hegemonic masculinity - \u201c(...) a man should be\nlarge, strong and physically capable, with low body fat and large well-defined muscles\u201d (Lee &amp; Owens, 2002, p.69). On the other hand, since women are traditionally responsible for nurturance, they are in charge of taking care of the health of men, which adds an extra burden to women and leads to a lack of information for men about their own health. In the words of de Souza and Ciclitira: \u201c(...) the care for men's health is constructed to be a woman's responsibility; while men are constructed as infantile and requiring care\u201d (2005, p. 802).\nIn this line of thought, Schofield, Connell, Walker, Wood &amp; Butland (2000) also refer the greater reluctance to seek help for mental problems, because \u201c(...) denial of depression is one of the means men use to demonstrate masculinities\u201d (Courtenay, 2000, p. 1397), and that can often increase the probability of engaging in alcohol or substance abuse, or even suicide. The same author cites numerous studies that describe the health stereotype of men as \u201c(...) independent, self-reliant, strong, robust and tough\u201d (2000, p. 1387), and stresses that men's health conduct leads not only to engaging in behaviours consistent with the hegemonic masculinity norms, but also to rejecting any norm of femininity. Relating to this is the violence that homosexual men are exposed to; men who endorse the hegemonic masculinity norms may engage in violent behaviour so as to distance themselves from any form of subordinated masculinity (any form of being a man that does not fit the standard of hegemonic masculinity), and to live up to the ideal of robustness.\nIn sum, literature highlights the influence of the adherence to hegemonic masculinity norms on health in general, referring to how men traditionally behave in order to comply with these same ideals (hence, focusing on descriptive norms). However, to the best of our knowledge, there seems to be a void in trying to understand how adherence to prescriptive masculinity norms impact on health, and especially, on food consumption. Therefore, this study will generally aim to investigate the relationship between adherence to masculinity norms and food consumption patterns.\n1.3.\tAims and Hypotheses\nIn the last section, we reviewed studies that indicate that the descriptive dimension of gender norms affects how and what men and women eat, or how they are perceived depending on what they eat. However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have yet focused on the influence of prescriptive norms, particularly masculinity norms, on food consumption. In the present study, we intended to explore the association between the conformity to prescriptive masculinity norms and food consumption. In line with the previous\nliterature on the impact of masculinity norms on men's health, we will first test the model depicted in Figure 1. More specifically, we expected that:\nH1: higher levels of conformity to masculinity norms will be related to higher meat consumption;\nH2: higher levels of conformity to masculinity norms will be associated with lower levels of fruit and vegetable consumption.\nBased on the gender in context model (Deaux &amp; Major, 1987) and the Focus Theory of Normative Conduct (Cialdini, Reno, &amp; Kallgren, 1990; Cialdini, Kallgren, &amp; Reno, 1991) we also intended to investigate to what degree gender salience moderates the relation between the adherence to masculinity norms and food consumption. We predicted that:\nH3: the relation between conformity to masculinity norms and food consumption will be stronger when gender is contextually salient.\nFigure 1 - Conceptual model of the moderation of gender salience on the relation between conformity to masculinity norms and meat, fruit and vegetable consumption\nWhen studying masculinities, most studies have focused solely on men (Levant, Hall, Weigold, &amp; McCurdy, 2015; Mahalik et al., 2003; Parent &amp; Morandi, 2011). Therefore, we also intended to further explore how women's conformity to masculinity norms influenced their food intake; however, given the exploratory nature of this part of the study, we did not know if the hypotheses posited for men could be generalised to women.\nWe further intended to investigate the model depicted in Figure 2. More specifically, we wanted to know whether the conformity to masculinity norms was a mediating mechanism of sex-related differences in food consumption. Accordingly, and drawing upon the literature that we have previously mentioned, we expected that:\nH4: women would report eating more vegetables/fruit and less meat than men\nH5: conformity to masculinity norms would account for (i.e., mediate) sex-related differences in fruit/vegetables and meat consumption.\nFigure 2 - Conformity to masculinity norms as mediator of the relation between participants' sex and their meat, fruit and vegetable consumption\nChapter II - Method\n2.1.\tParticipants\nAn online questionnaire was accessed by 934 individuals; however, 394 participants (42.18%) dropped out before total completion. Therefore, only the completed questionnaires were considered. There were no statistically significant differences (all p > 0.05) between those who completed the questionnaire and those who dropped out, in relation to sociodemographic variables (sex, age, marital status, region, level of education, employment status and dietary restrictions).\nData on participants with dietary restrictions relevant to this study (vegetarianism, no meat and/or processed meat consumption) were removed from the sample (n = 16 individuals, 2.96% of the total sample, 4 men and 12 women).\nThe final sample consisted of 519 individuals (64.93% women), ranging in age from 17 to 68 years old (M = 43.70; SD = 10.63). Many respondents lived in Lisbon metropolitan area (38.54%), whilst the others were unevenly spread across the country. Around one third (33.91%) had education below the university level, and the remaining 66.09% had higher education degrees. Most participants (63.78%) were married or were part of an unmarried couple, and 89.60% were employed.\nRegarding the final sample, there were sex-related differences only in geographical distribution (%2(6) = 13.34; p = 0.04; there is a statistically significant difference in Alentejo, with 18 women and 2 men) and education level (%2(7) = 17.58; p = 0.01); more women than men reported having higher education degrees (68.5% vs. 61.5%).\n2.2.\tDesign and Independent Variables\nThis study consisted of a 2 (Gender salience: low vs high) x 2 (Participants\u2019 Sex: Male vs. Female) quasi-experimental between-subjects design.\nGender salience was manipulated by stating, after the first part of the questionnaire, \u201cYou have now finished the first part of the questionnaire, which was intended to evaluate your masculinity/femininity score. Please proceed to the second part.\u201d; in the low salience condition, the message shown was \u201cYou have now finished the first part of the questionnaire, which was intended to evaluate your attitudes and values. Please proceed to the second part.\u201d Respondents were randomly assigned to the gender salience conditions. 261 (50.29%) respondents were randomly assigned to the high salience condition, while 258 (49.71%) were assigned to the low salience condition. There were no statistically significant differences\nbetween participants assigned to the two conditions in relation to the sociodemographic variables.\nAt the end of the questionnaire, two questions were included as manipulation checks; the first question was \u201cTo what extent did you feel that your masculinity/femininity was being assessed in this study?\u201d, measured in a scale of 1 (\u201cNot at all\u201d) to 7 (\u201cCompletely\u201d). The second question was \u201cTo what extent did this questionnaire make you think about your masculinity/femininity?\u201d, rated on a scale of 5 points (from \u201cNot at all\u201d to \u201cA lot\u201d). The two items were significantly correlated (rs-b (517) = 0.53; p &lt;0.01).\n2.3.\tInstruments\n2.3.1. Conformity to Hegemonic Masculinity Norms. A reduced version of the Conformity to Masculinity Norms Inventory (CMNI; Mahalik et al., 2003; validated to the Portuguese population by Leit\u00e3o, 2016) was used to evaluate respondents\u2019 conformity to hegemonic masculinity norms (the predictor in Fig. 1.1 and mediator in Fig 1.2). In the validation study to the Portuguese population, internal consistency was separately evaluated for men and women, with the men\u2019s sample having a higher value of internal consistency (a = 0.68) than the women\u2019s sample (a = 0.61).\nThis reduced version contains seven subscales - Winning (e.g., \u201cWinning is the only thing that matters\u201d), Dominance (e.g., \u201cI make sure people do as I say\u201d), Risk -taking (e.g., \u201cI like taking risks\u201d), Disdain for homosexuals (e.g., \u201cIt would be horrible if someone thought I was gay\u201d), Violence (e.g., \u201cSometimes, violent action is necessary\u201d), Pursuit of status (e.g., \u201cI would hate to be important\u201d - reverse scored), and Playboy (e.g., \u201cI would feel good if I had many sexual partners\u201d). The total number of items was 14, with two items per subscale (five of which had reversed scoring). Participants were asked to rate, on a Likert scale of 1 (\u201cStrongly disagree\u201d) to 4 (\u201cStrongly agree\u201d), how much they agreed with each of the items.\nTo assess the psychometric characteristics of this instrument in our sample, we conducted a principal axis factoring analysis with orthogonal rotation with the 14 items. In the final solution (Appendix A), 8 items were retained and 6 were removed, due to their low saturation and/or high cross loadings (differences between factor loading below 0.30). Four factors were extracted using the Kaiser criterion, accounting for 56.86% of the variance: Playboy/Playgirl, Disdain for Homosexuals, Risk-Taking and Violence. All factors presented acceptable internal consistency (Playboy/Playgirl: r<s-B) = 0.76 in the men\u2019s sample, and r<s-B) = 0.66 in the women\u2019s sample; Disdain for Homosexuals: r<s-B) = 0. 74 in the men\u2019s sample, and r(s-B) = 0.70 in the women\u2019s sample; Risk-Taking: r<s-B) = 0. 62 in the men\u2019s sample, and\nr(s-B) = 0.68 in the women's sample; Violence: r(s-B) = 0.72 in the men's sample, and r(s-B) = 0.62 in the women's sample). Scores were computed by averaging the two items that compose each factor, with higher scores translating greater norm conformity.\n2.3.2.\tMeat intake. In order to assess meat consumption frequency in a typical week, a question by Hoek, Luning, Weijzen, Engels, Kok, and de Graaf (2011), adapted by Gra\u00e7a, Calheiros, and Oliveira (2015) was included. The question was: \u201cIn a typical week, how many times do you eat a piece of red or processed meat?\u201d, and was followed by a description of what should be considered a piece of red or processed meat (a beef or pork palm-sized stake, or two slices of smoked meat, ham or bacon). There were five answering options, representing a progressive intake frequency: \u201cOnce a week or less\u201d, \u201cTwo to three times per week\u201d, \u201cFour to five times per week\u201d, \u201cSix to seven times per week\u201d and \u201cMore than seven times per week\u201d.\n2.3.3.\tFruit and vegetable intake. Respondents' consumption of fruit and vegetables in a typical week was measured with two questions, one for fruit intake and another for vegetable intake, based on the work of Godinho, Alvarez, Lima and Schwarzer (2014).\nInstructions were modified so as to consider fruit and vegetable intake in a typical week. It was also mentioned what should be considered as fruit portions (fruit itself and a glass of 100% fruit juice), and vegetable portions (soup, salad or a vegetable side dish, excluding potato). Both fruit and vegetable intake were measured in a seven-point scale, ranging from 1 (\u201cOnce a week or less\u201d) to 7 (\u201cMore than four times per day\u201d).\nFruit and vegetable consumption items were recoded in order to represent daily consumption (i.e., number of daily portions), and treated as metric variables.\n2.4.\tProcedure\nA questionnaire was built online, using Qualtrics platform. Two non-probabilistic sampling strategies were used to collect the data. First, a snowball sampling was used, whereby participants were asked to divulge the questionnaire to their acquaintances. Secondly, contacts were made through e-mail to City Halls, public libraries, both professional and volunteer firefighter corporations, Civil Protection departments, General-Secretariats of the Portuguese Ministries, police forces, private security companies, several branches of the Portuguese Armed Forces, trade unions, senior universities, and public transportation companies; these entities were asked to distribute the online questionnaire to their collaborators.\nThe data was collected from March 20 to May 10, 2016. The questionnaire was organised in three parts. The first part included the CMNI scale; the second part contained the gender salience manipulation condition (i.e., high vs. low), which were randomly displayed, and the third part contained the food consumption measures.\nAt the beginning of the questionnaire, informed consent was obtained, and information was provided about the general objective of the study, stating that the purpose was to \u201cunderstand the relation between your attitudes and values, and your eating behaviour\u201d; participation was voluntary and confidentiality of the collected data was also guaranteed, following the ethical guidelines approved by CIS-IUL, as well as the article 7 of the ethical code, relative to investigation on Psychology, of the Portuguese Board of Psychologists (Ordem dos Psic\u00f3logos Portugueses, 2011). The researcher\u2019s contact was given, in case participants had any doubts or suggestions, or wanted additional information about the study.\nBefore beginning the first part, sociodemographic data was collected in order to adapt the wording of the items to the respondent\u2019s sex.\nAfter the manipulation check, a final question was included to verify the participants\u2019 blindness to the study\u2019s objective, \u201cDo you think your answers to the first part of the questionnaire influenced your answers to the second part of the questionnaire?\u201d, to which participants could answer \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cYes\u201d; if this last option was selected, participants were asked to explain how they thought their answers to the food consumption measures were influenced by their answers to the first part of the questionnaire. Five participants were removed from the initial sample, since they had identified what the objective was.\nLastly, participants were thanked.\n2.5.\tData Analyses\nAll analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 23 software. First, sociodemographic variables were analysed and a qualitative analysis of the relevant dietary restriction was made. T-tests and chi-square test were performed to determine if there were differences in the sociodemographic variables between participants who completed the questionnaire and participants who dropped out. T-tests were also used to compare both experimental groups of gender salience, and thus verify if the manipulation was effective.\nDescriptive analyses of the dimensions of conformity to masculinity norms and the consumption items were performed, as well as Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to infer normality of the distributions of the variables, and t-tests to verify if there were sex differences in the dimensions.\nThen, the relations between the CMNI dimensions and consumption variables were assessed using Pearson correlations, separately for women and men, and for both gender salience conditions; Pearson correlation were used since the sample size is large, and the Central Limit Theorem can be applied (Field, 2009).\nThe correlations between the consumption items and sociodemographic variable were also analysed; correlations were computed separately for men and women. In the men\u2019s sample, vegetable consumption was significantly correlated with age (r (179) = -0.19; p = 0.01). In the women\u2019s sample, meat consumption was also significantly correlated with age (r (335) = -0.15; p = 0.01). Given these significant correlations, age was entered as a covariate in the multivariate regression models used to test the moderation of gender salience on the relation between adherence to masculinity norms and food consumption; in these analyses, the predictor - conformity to the Playboy norm - was centered, and the interaction term was constructed by multiplying the centered Playboy/Playgirl dimension variable by the condition variable. The centered variable, the interaction term and gender salience were then entered as predictors of vegetable consumption. The corresponding figure was computed using ModGraph (Jose, 2008).\nFinally, mediation analyses were conducted, using the four steps proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) and the Sobel test, to examine whether adherence to masculinity norms -namely, Violence and Playboy dimensions - mediated the relation between sex and meat and vegetable consumption, when in the high salience condition; age was also entered as a covariate in the mediation model.\nChapter III - Results\n3.1.\tManipulation Check\nIn the men\u2019s sample, there were statistically significant differences in the first manipulation check question - \u201cTo what degree did you feel that your masculinity/femininity was evaluated in this study?\u201d - (t (180) = -2.35; p = 0.02), with the high salience group presenting a higher sense that their masculinity and femininity had been evaluated (M = 3.57; SD = 1.26) than the low salience group (M = 3.11; SD = 1.34). There were also statistically significant differences in the second manipulation check question - \u201cTo what degree did this questionnaire make you think about your masculinity/femininity?\u201d - (t (180) = -2.12; p = 0.04), with the high salience group showing a higher level of thought about their masculinity and femininity (M = 2.40; SD = 1.10) than the low salience group (M = 2.05; SD = 1.16).\nIn the women\u2019s sample, however, there were no significant differences between the two conditions, both in the first (t (335) = -1.04, p = 0.30; low salience: M = 3.38; SD = 0.10; high salience: M = 3.53; SD = 0.10) and the second question (t (335) = -1.15, p= 0.25; low salience: M = 2.24; SD = 0.08; high salience: M = 2.38; SD = 0.09). Since there was no evidence that the manipulation of gender salience was effective for women, we have only tested the moderation hypothesis for men but not for women (see Figure 1 in the introduction chapter).\n3.2.\tDescriptive Statistics\nA table with the descriptive statistics of all items for the total sample is presented below (Table 1).\nTable 1 - Descriptive statistics and normality tests of the variables for the total sample\nVariables\tMin\tMax\tMedian\tMean\tSD\tSkewness/ S.E.\tKurtosis/ S.E.\tKS (Sig.)\nMasculinity norms\tPlayboy/Playgirl\t1\t4\t1.50\t1.62\t0.62\t7.85\t2.16\t0.00\nDisdain for homosexuals\t1\t4\t2.00\t2.24\t0.70\t2.05\t-0.73\t0.00\nRisk-taking\t1\t4\t2.00\t2.24\t0.57\t0.86\t-0.07\t0.00\nViolence\t1\t4\t2.00\t1.93\t0.73\t2.44\t-4.25\t0.00\nFood consumption\tMeat\t1\t5\t2.00\t2.17\t0.98\t6.36\t0.45\t0.00\nFruit\t0\t5\t2.00\t1.81\t1.30\t3.85\t-1.61\t0.00\nVegetables\t0\t5\t1.00\t1.45\t1.27\t8.22\t3.41\t0.00\nRegarding the conformity to Masculinity Norms, all dimensions had the same range of answers, varying from 1 to 4. Both the Disdain for Homosexuals and the Risk-taking had the highest mean value; participants somewhat agreed with those norms. The lowest mean value was registered for the Playboy/Playgirl dimension, meaning that on average participants did not particularly conform with this norm. All dimensions\u2019 distributions were slightly positively skewed. Two dimensions had mesokurtic distributions (Disdain for homosexuals and Risktaking), whilst the Playboy/Playgirl dimension had a leptokurtic distribution and the Violence dimension had a platykurtic distribution. Analysis of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed that none of the dimensions had a normal distribution.\nAs for the meat consumption, participants\u2019 answers varied between all answer options, from 1 (\u201cOnce a week or less\u201d) to 5 (\u201cMore than seven times per week\u201d), with a modal value of 2 (corresponding to \u201cTwo to three times per week\u201d). The distribution appeared to be positively skewed, with 50% of the distribution concentrating on the left side, and slightly leptokurtic.\nRegarding fruit and vegetable consumptions, all answer options were chosen in both questions, and varied from 0 (\u201cDoes not consume daily\u201d) to 5 (\u201cMore than four times a day\u201d). Fruit consumption had a modal value of 2 (which represented \u201cTwice a day\u201d); the distribution was positively skewed, and platykurtic. Vegetable consumption had a modal value of 1 (meaning that most participants chose the option \u201cOnce a day\u201d), and the answer distribution to this variable was positively skewed and leptokurtic. For both items, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated that none of the items had a normal distribution.\n3.2.1. Sex differences in the Conformity to Masculinity Norms and Food Consumption. As presented in Table 2, there were statistically significant differences between men and women, with men presenting higher mean values of conformity to masculinity norms in all four factors - Playboy/Playgirl (t (517) = -11.53,p &lt;0.01), Disdain for Homosexuals (t (339.38) = -3.84,p &lt;0.01), Risk-Taking (t (517) = -6.64,p &lt;0.01), and Violence (t (335.17) = -5.68, p &lt;0.01).\nTable 2 - Sex-related differences in the CMNI dimension and food consumption patterns\n\tSex\t\t\t\n\tMen\t\tWomen\t\n\tMean\tStd.

Also, women presented a higher mean value of daily frequency of consumption, both for fruit (t (517) = 4.30,p &lt;0.01) and vegetables (t (517) = 4.60, p &lt;0.01) than did men.\n3.3.\tCorrelations between adherence to masculinity norms and food consumption\nThe correlations between adherence to masculinity norms and food consumption indices are presented separately for men's and women's samples (Tables 3 and 4, respectively). For the men's sample these correlations are also presented separately for participants in the high and low gender salience conditions (Table 3). Since gender salience manipulation was not effective for women, Table 4 includes the intercorrelations for the total sample of female participants.\nIn the men's sample, the only significant correlation was found between vegetable consumption and the adherence to the Playboy norm, but only for men in the high gender salience condition. For these men, the more they adhered to the playboy norm the less they reported eating vegetables.\nTable 3 - Correlations between CMNI dimensions and food consumption variables in the men's sample by gender salience conditions\nCondition\t\tMeat consumption\tFruit consumption\tVegetable consumption\nLow\tPlayboy/Playgirl\t0.03\t0.01\t0.07\nsalience\tDisdain for\t0.12\t-0.17\t-0.12\n\thomosexuals\t\t\t\n\tRisk-taking\t0.06\t0.05\t0.09\n\tViolence\t0.14\t0.12\t0.00\nHigh\tPlayboy/Playgirl\t-0.04\t-0.13\t-0.24*\nsalience\tDisdain for\t0.18\t-0.07\t-0.04\n\thomosexuals\t\t\t\n\tRisk-taking\t0.14\t-0.09\t-0.13\n\tViolence\t0.05\t-0.09\t-0.04\n*p &lt;0.05.\nAs for women (Table 4), meat consumption had a significant positive association with the adherence to Violence norm, i.e., the more women adhered to the violence norm the more they reported eating meat.\nTable 4 - Correlations between CMNI dimensions and food consumption variables in the women's sample\n\tMeat consumption\tFruit consumption\tVegetable consumption\nPlayboy/Playgirl\t0.04\t-0.04\t-0.07\nDisdain for homosexuals\t0.01\t0.02\t-0.04\nRisk-taking\t0.02\t-0.01\t0.00\nViolence\t0.20*\t-0.01\t0.09\n* p &lt;0.01.\n3.4.\tModeration analysis\nIn order to test whether there is an effect of adherence to masculinity norms and food consumption moderated by gender salience (Figure 1), a linear regression analysis was performed for the men's sample.\nThe Playboy dimension was used since it correlated significantly with vegetable consumption in the men's sample. In the regression analysis, age was controlled for since it was significantly correlated to vegetable consumption; the model in which age was the only predictor was statistically significant, and accounted for 3% of the variance of vegetable consumption (R2adjusted = 0.03; F (1, 179) = 6.79, p = 0.01).\nAfterwards, adherence to Playboy norm and Gender salience were entered as predictors of vegetable consumption, as well as their interaction term. As compared to the previous model, this model accounted for more 35% (AR2adjusted = 0.04; F (4, 176) = 3.39, p = 0.01) of the variance of vegetable consumption. Neither the Playboy norm (P = 0.06; t = 0.60; p = 0.55) nor the gender salience (P = 0.06; t = 0.77; p = 0.44) alone were predictors of vegetable consumption; however, their interaction regression coefficient was negative and significant (P = -0.21; t = -2.20; p = 0.03). Figure 3 represents the decomposition of this interaction effect.\nFigure 3 - Moderation effect of gender salience on the relationship between adherence to the\nPlayboy norm and vegetable consumption in the men's sample\nAdherence to the Playboy norm\nGender salience\nHigh\n(Note: The medium value represents the mean of the adherence to the Playboy dimension, the low value represents the mean subtracting one standard deviation, and the high value represents the mean value adding one standard deviation.)\nAs shown in Figure 3, when in the high salience condition, men who have a higher level of adherence to the Playboy norm report less vegetable consumption (B = -0.55; p = 0.02).\nWhereas, in the low salience condition this relationship is no longer significant (B = 0.12; p = 0.55).\n3.5.\tMediation analysis\nTwo mediation analyses were performed; the first to examine if adherence to the Violence norm mediated the relationship between sex and meat consumption, and the second to examine if adherence to the Playboy/Playgirl norm mediated the relation between sex and vegetable consumption. Both analyses were performed with men and women in the high salience condition.\nAge was entered as a covariate in both mediation models; however, it was not a significant predictor in the mediation model regarding the violence dimension and meat consumption (R2adjusted = 0.01; F (1,256) = 3.40; p = 0.07), nor in the mediation of the playboy dimension on the relation between sex and vegetable consumption (R2adjusted = 0.01; F (1,256) = 2.63; p = 0.11).\nIn the first model, sex was regressed on meat consumption, showing that men have higher levels of meat consumption (since women were considered as the baseline category) (P = 0.18; t = 2.87; p &lt;0.01). Then, a regression of sex on the Violence dimension was computed, also showing that men had higher levels of adherence to the Violence dimension (P = 0.24; t = 4.01 ; p &lt;0.01). Lastly, sex and the Violence dimension were entered as predictors of meat consumption (R2adjusted = 0.06; F (3, 254) = 6.49, p &lt;0.01), showing that adherence to the Violence norm predicted meat consumption (P = 0.17; t = 2.73; p = 0.01). Although there was a decrease in the effect of sex, it continued to be a significant predictor of meat consumption (P = 0.13; t = 2.15; p = 0.03), suggesting a partial mediation. Sobel test confirms that the adherence to the violence norm partially mediated the relation between sex and meat consumption (Sobel z = 2.26; p = 0.02).\nIn the second tested model, sex and the Playboy/Playgirl dimension were regressed on vegetable consumption. First, sex was regressed on vegetable consumption, showing that women had significantly higher levels of vegetable consumption (P = -0.23; t = -3.80;p &lt;0.01). Next, sex was regressed on the Playboy/Playgirl dimension, indicating that men had higher adherence to the Playboy/Playgirl norm than women (P = 0.52; t = 9.82; p &lt;0.01). The last regression model was then computed, with sex and the Playboy/Playgirl dimension entered as predictors of vegetable consumption (R2adjusted = 0.06; F (3, 254) = 6.40, p &lt;0.01); while sex still held its effect on vegetable consumption (P = -0.17; t = -2.42; p = 0.02), the effect of the Playboy/Playgirl dimension was no longer significant (P = -0.11; t = -1.49; p =\n0.14). Given this result, mediation of the Playboy/Playgirl dimension in the relation between sex and vegetable consumption was not confirmed.\nChapter IV - Discussion\nThis study had the general purpose of examining the role of prescriptive masculinity norms in food consumption. Particularly, we aimed to explore the association between the conformity to masculinity norms and meat, fruit and vegetable consumption, and if this association was influenced by a context where gender was salient (see Figure 1 in the introduction); we also intended to investigate whether the conformity to masculinity norms would account for sex-related differences in food consumption (see Figure 2 in the introduction).\nIn relation to the moderation model (Figure 1), we hypothesised that, when gender was contextually salient, the relation between the conformity to masculinity norms and food consumption would be stronger, i.e., higher conformity to masculinity norms would be more strongly associated with more frequent meat consumption and lower intake of fruits and vegetables. As expected, and in line with the model of gender-in-context (Deaux &amp; Major, 1987), in the men's sample, when gender was salient, participants who had higher levels of conformity to the playboy norm reported significantly lower vegetable consumption; this relation did not hold when gender was not contextually salient. These findings suggest that the relation between the conformity to masculinity norms and food consumption is not constant, but context-dependent. Relating this result with the literature on impressionmanagement goals in food consumption, we can also conclude that, in men who conform with the playboy norm, gender salience will play an important role in food choice; in contexts where it is important to convey an impression congruent with the masculinity stereotype, man will distance themselves from foods typically associated to femininity, as is the case of vegetables (Baker &amp; Wardle, 2003).\nNo other results were found concerning the other three dimensions of masculinity norms present in the study (disdain for homosexuals, risk-taking and violence). First, as regards the disdain for homosexual norms, these results may suggest that participants who conformed more to this norm felt no need to assert their sexuality through their food intake report, which would explain the lack of results concerning this dimension. However, it was expected that the risk-taking norm would have a greater impact on food consumption report (e.g., higher meat intake), since this norm is related to health-risk behaviours (Mahalik et al., 2003); this absence of results could be accounted for by the low internal consistency that this dimension had on the men's sample. Lastly, the violence norm may have not presented significant results in the men's sample due to the relatively low mean of adherence to this norm; despite the fact that violence is much more tolerated within men, its mean of\nconformity is the second lowest of all norms' means. This may be accounted for social desirability concerns of the participants.\nUnfortunately, it was not possible to test the effect of gender salience on the relation between conformity to masculinity norms and food consumption among women, since the manipulation of gender salience was not effective with this sample. Women may be influenced by the fact that men are viewed as the norm, and women as the exception (Amancio &amp; Oliveira, 2006), which may make gender more salient, across all social contexts, to women than to men. Thus, our manipulation of gender context may have been not strong enough to elicit this concept in women; despite the fact that women's answers to the manipulation check questions are higher in the high salience condition, the difference among the two conditions is not statistically significant, which supports our assumption that, for women, gender is salient by default. Nonetheless, in the women's sample, there was a positive correlation between the conformity to the violence norm and meat consumption; this association seems to hold relevant implications. Amancio (1993) studied the stereotypical representations of men and women in the Portuguese society, finding that, while \u201cauthoritarian\u201d and \u201cdominant\u201d were considered masculine traits, \u201caffable\u201d, \u201ctender\u201d, \u201csensitive\u201d and \u201cfragile\u201d were seen as feminine traits, suggesting a submissive dimension in the feminine stereotype; since violence is such a non-normative concept for women, the conformity to a traditional masculinity norm, such as the violence norm, may bring to consciousness the fact that meat is a food traditionally linked to masculinity, and thus heighten its intake report. They may also view meat as a way to express their masculinity, by adopting a behaviour typically associated with its norms (Courtenay, 2000). In this way, we can explain the positive association between women who show a greater conformity to masculinity norms, and a tendency to report more meat consumption. This result also shows that there are differences, across women, in relation to their degree of conformity to masculinity norms; however, since interventions relating to food consumption (particularly excess of meat consumption and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake) may target mostly men, since this consumption pattern, as discussed before, is considered typically male, women who conform with the masculinity norms may be at a greater risk of health problems such as colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease.\nIn relation to the mediation model (see Figure 2), our analyses confirmed that there are sex differences in meat consumption: in line with the literature on sex-related differences in food consumption (Roos, Lahelma, Virtanen, Prattala, &amp; Pietinen, 1998; Fagerli &amp; Wandel, 1999; Baker &amp; Wardle, 2003; Wardle et al., 2004), there were different consumption patterns\nbetween men and women: while women reported a higher frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, men reported a higher frequency of meat consumption. (which goes in line with the findings of Beardsworth et al., 2002, and Prattala et al., 2007). It was also confirmed that men have higher levels of conformity to masculinity norms than women in all dimensions, a result that is congruent with other studies on this matter (Mahalik et al., 2003; Owen, 2011; Leit\u00e3o, 2015). The greatest differences between men's and women's means of conformity were observed in the playboy and the violence norms, which may explain the fact that these two norms presented stronger associations with food consumption . Furthermore, the violence dimension was the only norm that mediated the relation between sex and meat consumption . This suggests that, although sex, by itself, is an important predictor of meat consumption, their relation can be partially accounted for by prescriptive gender norms; men's significantly higher meat intake is not only explained by their sex, but also by their significantly higher conformity to the masculinity norm of violence. Conversely, women's lower meat consumption can also be related to their lower conformity to the violence norm.\nDespite the fact that the playboy norm significantly correlated with vegetable consumption, its inability to account for the sex differences in this food's intake may be explained by the low conformity of women to this norm, also found in other studies (Cu\u00e9llar-Flores, S\u00e1nchez-L\u00f3pez, Dresch, 2011; Owen, 2011).\n4.1. Limitations and future research\nWhile these results represent an important step in understanding the role of prescriptive gender norms and gender salience in food consumption, there are some limitations to be reckoned.\nFirst, not all dimensions produced the expected results. This might be explained by the lower internal consistency of the masculinity norm measure in the present sample - although this measure had generally corroborated the original results in a Spanish sample (Cu\u00e9llar-Flores, S\u00e1nchez-L\u00f3pez, Dresch, 2011). The fact that this measure of conformity to masculinity norms was not adequate to this sample, may have limited the study of how different norms affect men's and women's food consumption behaviours.\nResults may have also been affected by the food consumption measures that asked for past consumption instead of future intentions of consumption. Although questions about past consumption may generally be influenced by participants' desire to portrait themselves in a positive way, they may not be as permeable to manipulation as future intention questions, since participants were asked to remember their consumption patterns, instead of how they\nintend to behave in the future. In future studies, it would be interesting to verify if future intentions questions hold similar results.\nIt would also be important to further investigate how gender salience influences women's food intake; as it was mentioned earlier, gender stereotypes are not equally present in men and women; since being a woman is always salient (Amancio, 1993), it would have been necessary to produce a stronger manipulation of gender salience in women; this study failed to do so, but, in future studies, this would be a relevant question to address.\nGiven that this was a correlational study, we cannot interpret these findings as relations of causality between the conformity to masculinity norms and food consumption. The size of the effects can also be a constrain to their interpretation, since they may be too small to be generalized; reinforcing the ecological validity of the results, by using different dependent variables and a stronger manipulation of the gender salience, would be an asset to future studies.\nDespite the limitations of this study, it represents a first step in understanding how prescriptive masculinity norms affect food consumption, and its results corroborate that there are differences in food consumption between men and women; however, sex is not the only variable at play, and gender takes a partial but significant role in food consumption, through gender norms and contextual salience.\nFirstly, it is vital to broaden the study of food consumption patterns to men; as discussed earlier, a great deal of literature concerning food consumption focuses exclusively on women; moreover, literature has mostly focused on describing differences in consumption patterns. In this study, we aimed to go beyond descriptive norms, and try to understand how gender stereotypes, through the conformity to gender norms, actually affect people's behaviours.\nSecondly, by studying masculinity norms' effect, not only on men's, but also on women's behaviour, this study contributes to the understanding that gender is a continuum, and that masculinity (and femininity) norms can affect both men and women, since there are differences in their adherence not only between men and women, but also among men and women. This finding can have an important impact on the designing of interventions targeted to promote healthier food consumption patterns; it would be crucial, in our point of view, to understand whether our findings can extend to other health behaviours.\nIn conclusion, while there are sex-related differences in food consumption, gender has an important role in explaining them, and social context is determinant in this relation.\nReferences\nAm\u00e2ncio, L.
