Most of the published work regarding the biological \n\nprofile of nanoHA relies on films, composite scaffolds, dense or porous bulks or \n\ncements manufactured with HA nanoparticles. A clear deficit exists on studies \n\naddressing the biological assessment of individual nanosized HA particles. Considering \n\nthe close association of angiogenesis and osteogenesis in bone formation events, this \n\nstudy aims to address the biological profile of nanoHA particles on isolated and co-\n\ncultured  osteoblast and endothelial cells. \n\nIn the present study, nanoHA particles, sinthesized by a hydrothermal method, \n\nwere characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transmission infrared \n\nspectroscopy (FTIR) and tansmission eletron microscopy (TEM). In vitro biological \n\nstudies were performed using MG-63 osteoblast-like cells (10\n3\n cell cm\n\n-2\n) and human \n\ndermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC, 2x10\n4\n cell cm\n\n-2\n) cultured isolated or \n\nco-cultured in endothelium medium. Cultures were maintained for 14 days in the \n\nabsence (control) and in the presence of different concentrations of nanoparticles. \n\nNanoHA particles (1-100 ?g ml\n-1\n\n) were added to the seeded cells at two different \n\nmoments: day 1 and at day 7. Nanoparticles added at day 1: cultures were \n\ncharacterized at days 2, 7 and 14; nanoparticles added at day 7: cultures were \n\nevaluated at days 8(7) and 14(7), for cell viability/proliferation (MTT assay), pattern of \n\ncell growth (confocal layser scanning microscopy; CLSM), particle internalization and \n\nkinetics within cell compartiments (TEM). \n\nResults showed that monocultures of MG-63 cells and HDMEC, maintained in \n\nthe absence of nanoparticles, presented high viability and the expected pattern of cell \n\ngrowth. Also, control co-cultures exhibited high viability and the formation of clusters \n\nof osteoblastic cells surrounded by endothelial cells. The presence of nanoHA caused a \n\ndose-dependent increase in the viability/proliferation of osteoblast cells, but opposite \n\nresults were found in HDMEC. Co-cultures showed a slight increase in the cell \n\nviability/proliferation. Particles were readily internalized by both MG-63 cells and \n\nHDMEC, but endothelial cells presented the higher percentage of intracellular vesicles \n\nloaded with nanoparticles. Co-cultured osteoblastic and endothelial cells exhibited less \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n \n\ninternalization of nanoparticles, compared to the respective monocultures. The \n\ndescribed effects, caused by the presence of nanoHA particles, were more significant \n\nwhen those were added at the beginning of the culture. \n\nResults suggest that nanoHA particles modulate the behaviour of osteoblastic \n\nand endothelial cells and also affects the interaction between these two cell types, \n\nrepresenting a promissing biomaterial for new strategies in bone tissue engineering. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n \n\nRESUMO \n\nA nano-hidroxiapatite (nanoHA) tem in\u00fameras aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em estrat\u00e9gias de \n\nrepara\u00e7\u00e3o e regenera\u00e7\u00e3o do tecido \u00f3sseo. A maioria dos trabalhos publicados, a \n\nprop\u00f3sito do perfil biol\u00f3gico da nanoHA, baseia-se em filmes, comp\u00f3sitos, estruturas \n\ndensas ou porosas, ou cimentos compostos por nanopart\u00edculas de HA. No entanto, \n\nexiste um d\u00e9fice evidente em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 avalia\u00e7\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica de nanopart\u00edculas isoladas \n\nde HA. Considerando a estreita associa\u00e7\u00e3o entre os processos de angiog\u00e9nese e \n\nosteog\u00e9nese nos eventos de forma\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3ssea, este estudo pretende abordar o perfil \n\nbiol\u00f3gico das nanopart\u00edculas de HA em monoculturas e co-culturas de c\u00e9lulas \n\nosteobl\u00e1sticas e endoteliais. \n\nNo presente estudo, as nanopart\u00edculas de HA, sintetizadas por m\u00e9todo \n\nhidrotermal, foram caracterizadas por XRD, an\u00e1lise FTIR e TEM. Os estudos biol\u00f3gicos \n\nin vitro foram realizados utilizando culturas isoladas e co-culturas de c\u00e9lulas \n\nosteobl\u00e1sticas humanas MG-63 (10\n3\n cell cm\n\n-2\n) e c\u00e9lulas endoteliais microvasculares \n\nd\u00e9rmicas humanas (HDMEC, 2x10\n4\n cell cm\n\n-2\n), em meio de cultura endotelial. As \n\nculturas foram mantidas por 14 dias na aus\u00eancia (controlo) e na presen\u00e7a de \n\nnanopart\u00edculas em diferentes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es. As nanopart\u00edculas de HA (1-100 ?g ml\n-1\n\n) \n\nforam adicionadas \u00e0s c\u00e9lulas em cultura em dois momentos diferentes: ao dia 1 e ao \n\ndia 7. Para as part\u00edculas adicionadas ao dia 1: as culturas foram caracterizadas nos dias \n\n2, 7 e 14; para as part\u00edculas adicionadas ao dia 7: as culturas foram avaliadas aos dias \n\n8(7) e 14(7), para os padr\u00f5es de viabilidade/prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celular (MTT) e de \n\ncrescimento celular (CLSM), assim como para a internaliza\u00e7\u00e3o das part\u00edculas e a sua \n\ncin\u00e9tica dentro dos compartimentos celulares (TEM). \n\nOs resultados obtidos demonstraram que as monoculturas de c\u00e9lulas MG-63 e \n\nHDMEC, na aus\u00eancia de nanopart\u00edculas, apresentaram alta viabilidade celular e o \n\nesperado padr\u00e3o de crescimento celular. Para al\u00e9m disso, as co-culturas controlo \n\napresentaram alta viabilidade celular e a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de aglomerados de c\u00e9lulas \n\nosteobl\u00e1sticas rodeadas por c\u00e9lulas endoteliais. A presen\u00e7a de nanopart\u00edculas de HA \n\npromoveu um aumento dose-dependente na viabilidade/prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celular dos \n\nosteoblastos, no entanto resultados opostos foram encontrados nas culturas de \n\nHDMEC. J\u00e1 nas co-culturas o padr\u00e3o de viabilidade/prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celular apresentou um \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n \n\nligeiro aumento. As part\u00edculas eram facilmente internalizadas por ambos os tipos \n\ncelulares, contudo as c\u00e9lulas endoteliais apresentaram uma maior percentagem de \n\nves\u00edculas intracelulares carregadas com nanopart\u00edculas. As co-culturas de c\u00e9lulas \n\nosteobl\u00e1sticas e endoteliais apresentaram menor internaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de part\u00edculas, em \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o com as respectivas monoculturas. Os efeitos descritos, causados pela \n\npresen\u00e7a de nanopart\u00edculas de HA, foram mais significativos quando estas eram \n\nadicionadas no in\u00edcio da cultura. \n\nOs resultados obtidos sugerem que as nanopart\u00edculas de HA t\u00eam capacidade de \n\nmodular o comportamento das c\u00e9lulas osteobl\u00e1sticas e endoteliais, afectando tamb\u00e9m \n\na interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre estes dois tipos celulares, apresentando-se como um biomaterial \n\npromissor para novas estrat\u00e9gias utilizadas pela engenharia de tecido \u00f3sseo. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n     Acknowledgments\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 i \n\n     Abstract\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 iii \n\n     Resumo\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. v \n\n     List of Contents\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 vii \n\n     List of Figures\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 ix \n\n     List of Tables\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. xii \n\n     List of Abbreviations \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 xiii \n\n  \n\nChapter I Introduction  \n\n     I.1.

Bone biology \n\n Bone is a dynamic connective tissue that performs several key functions within \n\nhigher vertebrates. It is the material from which the skeleton is made, providing \n\nsupport and protection to the internal organs (Saladin, 2004). Besides, it provides \n\nattachment for muscles, facilitating the locomotion process; it is involved in the \n\nsynthesis of blood cells and in the metabolism of mineral ions such as calcium and \n\nphosphorous (Morgan and Bouxsein, 2008). Throughout life, bone is continually \n\nchanging to adapt its shape and structure to perform different tasks. This process of \n\nrenewal happens by laying down new bone tissue and resorbing old (Einhorn, 1996; \n\nHing, 2004).  \n\nDuring this work, we will review the main aspects of bone biology, such as, \n\nbone morphogenesis and structure, bone vascularization, bone metabolic role and \n\nfinally bone remodeling and repair.   \n\n \n\nI.1.1. Bone morphogenesis  \n\nOsteogenesis is the process through which mature bone is formed. Accordingly, \n\nthe ossification process occurs by two different methods: intramembranous \n\nossification and endochondral ossification (Seeley et al., 2004). \n\nThe formation of flat bones like the vault of the skull, the pelvis, and the \n\nmajority of face bones occurs by intramembranous ossification. Thus, during \n\nembryonic development, mesenchymal cells condensate and differentiate into \n\nosteoprogenitor cells, and then into osteoblasts, which line up around blood vessels \n\n(Marks and Hermey, 1996). At this point, all the necessary conditions to start to \n\nproduce and deposit new bone matrix are present (Buckwalter et al., 1996a). The first \n\nstructure to be formed is a network of trabeculae composing the cancellous bone, \n\nwhich undergoes continuous mineralization. When the osteoblasts and osteoclasts \n\ncoupled actions begin, the trabeculae are remodeled. At the end of this process, the \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n2 \n \n\nnewly formed bones present a typical arrangement: the cancellous bone is flanked by \n\ncompact bone (Saladin, 2004; Seeley et al., 2004). \n\nEndochondral ossification occurs in long bones, like the bones of the vertebral \n\ncolumn, the base of the skull, part of the mandible and in the appendicular skeleton, \n\nformed from a cartilage model (Meghji, 1992; Buckwalter et al., 1996a). Thus, \n\nembryonic mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes, which proliferate and \n\nproduce a collagenous matrix, leading to the formation of a hyaline cartilage model \n\n(Ortega et al., 2004). \n\nIn the interior of the cartilage model, chondrocytes undergo a progressive \n\nhypertrophy and the cartilage matrix becomes mineralized, leaving behind \n\ninterconnected spaces (Marks and Hermey, 1996). Simultaneously, at the surface of \n\nthe developing endochondral bone, the perichondrium is responsible for laying down a \n\nthin osteoblastic layer, surrounding the diaphysis, named periosteal collar (Marks and \n\nHermey, 1996). \n\nFrom this moment on, primary ossification takes place. Therefore, blood vessels \n\ninvade the central region of the mineralized and hypertrophied cartilage, taking with it \n\nosteoprogenitor cells and osteoblastic precursors, responsible for osteoblastic \n\ndifferentiation, and therefore bone formation (Marks and Hermey, 1996; Scotti et al., \n\n2010). At the same time, osteoclastic invading cells resorb the central part of the \n\ncartilage leading to the formation of a marrow cavity (Buckwalter et al., 1996a). \n\nThe epiphysis of a long bone and, the extremities of irregular and flat bones, \n\nare formed by secondary ossification. Separating the epiphysis from the diaphysis is a \n\nnewly formed structure named epiphysial or growth plate. This specific area is \n\nresponsible for chondrocytes segregation, proliferation and hypertrophy, resulting in \n\nlongitudinal bone growth, until skeletal maturity, when the diaphysis and epiphysis \n\nfuse with each other (Marks and Hermey, 1996; Ortega et al., 2004).  \n\nA proper vascular network is also important to ensure the transportation of \n\noxygen, nutrients, several cells and soluble factors, necessary to the skeletal \n\nhomeostasis. The modification of this homeostasis leads to several bone pathologies, \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n3 \n \n\nsuch as osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis and osteoporosis, caused by abnormal blood \n\nsupply (Carmeliet, 2003). \n\nAngiogenesis is a biological process through which new vessels sprout from pre-\n\nexisting ones, bridge and growth until a new functional structure is formed (Vander et \n\nal., 2001a).  During bone formation, the angiogenic process is important to the \n\nintramembranous and endochondral ossification. Thus, the vascular invasion into the \n\nmesenchymal zone during intramembranous ossification and the vascular supply to \n\nthe growth plate during endochondral ossification, are essential to a complete process \n\n(Saladin, 2004). Moreover, during fracture repair neoangiogenesis occurs until vascular \n\nsupply returns to normal (Carano and Filvaroff, 2003). \n\nThe normal angiogenic process is regulated by several factors, like vascular \n\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF); basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF); various \n\nmembers of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) family; hypoxia-inducible \n\ntranscription factor (HIF) and angiopoietins 1 (Ang-1) (Kanczler and Oreffo, 2008). The \n\nVEGFs are important growth factors since they are involved in the regulation of \n\nvasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and also play an important role in bone growth and \n\nrepair (Carano and Filvaroff, 2003). The main effects of VEGFs are on endothelial cells, \n\nbut the VEGF receptors are also expressed on monocytes, chondrocytes and \n\nosteoblasts. Moreover, besides the angiogenic effects, VEGFs can induce \n\nhaematopoietic stem cell recruitment from bone marrow, monocyte chemoattraction, \n\nneural protection and bone formation (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth, 1997). \n\n \n\nI.1.2. Bone structure \n\nThe overall structure of the bone is composed of two different types of \n\norganization: compact or cortical bone and, cancellous or trabecular bone. While the \n\nfirst type is relatively dense and is found at the bone surface, functioning as a \n\nprotection in mechanically demanding regions, cancellous bone consists in a network \n\nof trabeculae surrounding interconnected spaces and it is found in the interior of \n\nbones (Fig. 1) (Tartaglia and Waugh, 2002a). \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n4 \n \n\nCompact bone represents 80% of the mature skeleton, distributed by the long \n\nbones diaphysis and surrounding the majority of bones (Pratt, 1991). It is constituted \n\nby quasi-cilindrical elements called osteons or Harvesian systems, which are formed by \n\ndensely packed collagen fibrils called lamellae (Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996).   Each \n\nof these structures presents a central lumen containing a blood vessel responsible for \n\nthe vascular supply along the axis of a long bone. Moreover, compact bone also has \n\ntransversal blood vessels, perpendicular to the axis of a long bone, located in \n\nVolkmann canals, as well as capillaries and venules from microcirculation and, \n\noccasionally, a nerve fiber (Seeley et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Overview of a long bone constitution. Compact bone composed by osteons (detailed view) \n\nand cancellous bone with trabeculae. Periosteum (inner and outer layer) and endosteum representation \n\n(Adapted from Seeley et al., 2004).   \n\nCancellous bone is also called spongy bone, because of the porous appearance \n\ncreated by the network of trabeculae. It exists within the cortical bone, in the central \n\nregion of flat and irregular bones such as vertebrae, skull and pelvic bones but also in \n\nthe long bones mataphysis and epiphysis (Pratt, 1991). Despite its porous appearance, \n\ncancellous bone has a structural support function, since its trabeculae are oriented by \n\nstress and tension lines in the interior of the bone. As well as compact bone, \n\ncancellous bone matrix is organized in lamellae, without a complete osteon \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n5 \n \n\norganization (Saladin, 2004). Furthermore, this type of bone filled by blood vessels, \n\nbone marrow cells and adipocytes is related with cellular functions presenting a high \n\nmetabolic rate (Buckwalter et al., 1996b). \n\nWhether it is compact or cancellous, bone has layers of connective tissue and \n\nbone forming cells covering its external and internal surfaces, namely the periosteum \n\nand the endosteum. Furthermore, as a connective tissue, bone is constituted by the \n\nextracellular matrix, with organic and inorganic components, functioning as a scaffold \n\nfor the different types of bone cells (Seeley et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nI.1.2.1. Periosteum and endosteum  \n\nPeriosteum is the external coating of the majority of bone surfaces, present in \n\nlocations of high risk of fracture and, absent from tendon, articular surfaces and, \n\nligament insertions (Allen et al., 2004). The periosteum is attached to the bone by \n\ncollagen fibers, also called Sharpey\u2019s fibers oriented by tension forces that penetrate \n\ninto the bone promoting a tight junction between bone tissue and the periosteum \n\n(Saladin, 2004; Junqueira and Carneiro, 2005).  \n\n Periosteum is described as a fibro-vascular membrane that is composed by an \n\nexternal layer, named fibrous layer and, an inner layer called osteogenic layer (Fig. 1) \n\n(Allen et al., 2004). The fibrous layer of the periosteum is composed by numerous \n\nfibroblasts with collagen and elastin fibers, associated in a microvascular network. The \n\ninner osteogenic layer is formed by osteogenic progenitor cells which differentiate into \n\nosteoblasts. This part of the periosteum is responsible for the diaphysis diameter \n\nincrease and for fracture regeneration, since cellular growth occurs by layers (Dwek, \n\n2010). \n\nEndosteum is a single-celled membrane formed by osteoprogenitor cells and \n\nhematopoietic stem cells (Balduino et al., 2005). It is the inner coating of all bone \n\ncavities, such as, the medullary cavity of long bones diaphysis and the trabecullae in \n\ncancellous bone (Fig. 1) (Seeley et al., 2004; Mescher, 2010). \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n6 \n \n\nThese two types of connective tissue, intimately connected with bone, are \n\ndirectly involved in bone growth and regeneration during fracture repair, acting as a \n\ncontinuous source of bone cells (Junqueira and Carneiro, 2005). \n\n \n\nI.1.2.2. Bone matrix \n\nThe bone extracellular matrix has two main components: the organic matrix \n\nand the inorganic matrix. The organic matrix, composed by collagen and non-\n\ncollagenous proteins, accounts for 35% of the total weight of bone tissue compared \n\nwith 65% for the inorganic components (Ca\n2+\n\n and PO4\n3-\n\n) (Buckwalter et al., 1996b). \n\nThe organic extracellular matrix major component is collagen type I (COL I), a \n\nbone structural protein responsible for bone\u2019s wide range of mechanical properties \n\n(Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996). \n\nComposing one collagen molecule structure are three polypeptide chains \n\norganized in a triple helix. Each chain is made by a sequence of aminoacids with high \n\ncontent in glycin, prolin and hydroxyproline. COL I is composed of two ?1 chains and \n\none ?2 chain, being each type of chain coded by two different genes (Van Der Rest and \n\nGarrone, 1991; Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996; Cowles et al., 1998). \n\nProcollagen is the synthesized form of collagen, formed by triple helix ? chains, \n\nwhich will have their N- and C-propeptides removed by specific proteases. These \n\nchanges promote the molecules assembling into a fibril form, displayed in a \n\noverlapping manner with spaces between adjacent fibrils. The intermolecular \n\ncrosslinks formed have a very high tensile strength functioning as a scaffold for bone \n\ngrowth (Eyer, 1996; Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996).The fibrillar collagens group is \n\ncomposed by: type I, type II, type III, type V, type XI, type XXIV and type XXVII collagen \n\nforms (Van Der Rest and Garrone, 1991; Bou-Gharios and Crombrugghe, 2008).  \n\nThe remainder part of the organic matrix is composed by non-collagenous \n\nproteins such as glycoproteins, proteoglycans and several other exogenous proteins \n\nwith important biological activity in the bone (Cowles et al., 1998).

These mineral \n\ncrystals, with plate-like shape, are deposited by cellular control into the extracellular \n\nmatrix, between adjacent collagen fibrils, originating the strength and stiffness of bone \n\n(Olszta et al., 2007; Orimo, 2010). In addition to calcium and phosphorous there are \n\nother ions, found in minor percentage in bone, such as bicarbonate, potassium, \n\nsodium, magnesium and citrate (Buckwalter et al.,1996b). \n\n \n\nI.1.2.3. Bone cells  \n\nThroughout life, bone cells play an important role in bone maintenance, \n\nthrough their capability to synthesize and resorb the extracellular matrix. The cells \n\nresponsible for these events are: osteoblasts, osteocytes, bone linning cells and \n\nosteoclasts (Fig. 2). \n\n \n\nFigure 2. The origins and location of bone cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes and bone lining \n\ncells (Adapted from Marks and Hermey, 1996). \n\nBone cells have different origins (Fig. 2). Osteocytes, osteoblasts and bone \n\nlinning cells are derived from undifferentiated pluripotent mesenchymal cells, located \n\nin bone marrow, endosteum and periosteum (Buckwalter et al., 1996b). Proliferation \n\nand differentiation of mesenchymal cells are under influence of hormones and growth \n\nfactors, determining the type of cells formed during differentiation. Thus, \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n9 \n \n\nmesenchymal cells can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, \n\nmyoblasts and fibroblasts (Triffitt, 1996). Osteoclasts belong to the monocyte-\n\nmacrophage lineage, being the final product of hemopoietic lineage (Suda et al., 1996). \n\nLocated at the formation and remodeling zones of bone, are osteoblasts \u2013 bone \n\nforming cells \u2013 responsible for synthesize and secret unmineralized bone matrix, called \n\nosteoid (Cowin and Doty, 2007). Moreover, osteoblasts are also involved in the \n\nmineralization process of bone matrix (Aubin and Lui, 1996; Orimo, 2010).  \n\n Active osteoblasts are mononucleated, cuboidal cells tightly packed along bone \n\nsurface, with a prominent Golgi apparatus, well-developed rough endoplasmatic \n\nreticulum, and large quantities of mitochondria (Marks and Hermey, 1996; Junqueira \n\nand Carneiro, 2005). This type of bone cell is responsible for the synthesis of bone \n\nmatrix proteins, such as COL I and noncollagenous proteins, that are stored in vesicles \n\nand then released to the extracellular space, by exocytosis. Additionally, bone matrix \n\nbecome calcified when osteoblasts secrete vesicles filled with calcium ions (Ca\n2+\n\n) and \n\nphosphate ions (PO4\n2-\n\n), promoting HA crystals formation and deposition throughout \n\nthe osteoid (Gay et al., 2000; Seeley, 2004; Orimo, 2010). By the time that the matrix \n\nsynthesis process is over, inactive osteoblasts flatten, acting as a protective layer of the \n\nnewly formed bone (Junqueira and Carneiro, 2005). \n\n During bone formation, certain osteoblasts become surrounded by bone \n\nmatrix and differentiate into osteocytes (Cowin and Doty, 2007). Thus, osteocytes are \n\nsmaller than osteoblasts presenting dendritic shape, oval nucleus and few cytoplasm, \n\nless prominent endoplasmatic reticulum and smaller Golgi apparatus (Marks and \n\nHermey, 1996). Mature osteocyte occupies the matrix lacunae, and communicates \n\nwith neighboring osteocytes, as well as, bone surface and blood vessels, through \n\nfilipodia connections, ensuring the access to oxygen and nutrients (Nijweide et al., \n\n1996). Besides, osteocytes function as strain detectors and consequently coordinate \n\nosteoblasts and osteoclasts activity, when bone remodeling is needed (Saladin, 2004). \n\nBone lining cells are inactive osteoblasts, located at bone surface, at zones \n\nwhere bone is not under formation or resorption (Marks and Hermey, 1996). These \n\ncells are flat and elongated, presenting a spindle-shaped nucleus, and fewer \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n10 \n \n\ncytoplasmatic organelles (Cowin and Doty, 2007). Additionally, Everts and colleagues \n\nhave proposed that bone lining cells in vitro are responsible for: 1) \u201ccleaning\u201d bone \n\nsurface from nonmineralized collagen fibrils before osteoclastic attachment; 2) for \n\ndigesting the collagen left by osteoclasts after resorption ; 3) form a cement line and \n\ndeposit a thin layer of fibrillar collagen on the cleaned surfaces (Everts et al., 2002).  \n\nThe fourth cellular component of bone is the osteoclasts (Fig. 3), a large (20-\n\n100 \u00b5m), multinucleated (2 to 50 nucleus) cell. The main function of this type of cell is \n\nto resorb bone, dentin and calcified cartilage (Marks and Hermey, 1996).  \n\nOsteoclasts have their polarity changed during the resorption cycle. Thus \n\nresorbing osteoclast is highly polarized, when compared with nonresorbing osteoclast \n\n(V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen, 1996). When resorption sites are determined, osteoclasts attach to bone \n\nsurface, through a specific membrane domain named sealing zone, which delimits \n\nother membrane domain - the ruffled border. This specific zone, with its finger-like \n\nprojections, is where the bone matrix demineralization and degradation process take \n\nplace (Saladin, 2004; Mescher, 2010). The ruffled border creates an acidic environment \n\nbetween the osteoclasts and the matrix causing HA crystals dissolution, consequently \n\nforming resorption lacunae, named Howship\u2019s lacunae (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen and Zhao, 2008). \n\nAfter matrix demineralization, degradation of collagenous matrix happens with the \n\nruffled border secreting several proteinases, such as metalloproteinases (MMPs) and \n\nlysossomal cysteine proteinases (Kusano et al., 1998; Delaisse et al., 2000).Additionally \n\nto those mentioned membrane domains, osteoclasts have a homogeneous membrane, \n\nknown as basolateral membrane, and a secretory domain that function as a site for the \n\nresorbed products exocytose (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen et al., 2000).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n11 \n \n\n                 \n\nFigure 3. Image showing an osteoclast digesting bone tissue. Osteoclasts with multiple nuclei and a \n\nruffled border in direct contact with the bone matrix. As a result of osteoclasts activity a Howship\u2019s \n\nlacunae is formed (Adapted from Junqueira and Carneiro, 2005). \n\n \n\nI.1.3. Bone vascularization  \n\nThe presence of blood vessels in bone tissue is very important in cases of bone \n\ngrowth, bone healing, fracture repair and osteogenesis. A proper blood supply is \n\nnecessary to maintain bone vitality, and to sustain bone and bone marrow cells \n\nfunction, through oxygen and nutrients input and metabolic waste products output \n\n(Shim, 1968). \n\nBlood supply in long bones is made by several arteries, which penetrate the \n\nbone cortexes in different locations: in the diaphysis, in the metaphysis and in the \n\nepiphysis. Hence, there are the nutrient artery, the metaphysial artery, the epiphysial \n\nartery, and periosteal vessels that carry arterial blood to the bone. This group of \n\narteries is interconnected by longitudinal anastomoses creating a network around the \n\ndiaphysis and metaphysis (Tartaglia and Waugh, 2002b).  \n\nBone supply is made by centrifugal flow, meaning that arterial blood goes first \n\nto the medullary cavities and then flows to the outer cortex through the arteries that \n\narise inside the Haver\u2019s and Volkmann\u2019s canals. This group of vessels is responsible for \n\nblood supply to the inner 2/3 of the cortex, while the periosteal vessels supply the \n\nouter third (Al-Motabagani, 2002; Travlos, 2006). \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n12 \n \n\nAlong the diaphysis axis, there is a sinus that drains into veins: metaphysial \n\nvein, epiphysial vein and centromedullary veins. This group of veins runs in parallel \n\nwith the arteries, and carries venous blood out of the bone (Laroche, 2002; Tartaglia \n\nand Waugh, 2002b).  \n\n \n\nI.1.4. Bone tissue metabolic role  \n\nBone tissue contains 99% of total body calcium and, some of the most \n\nimportant functions of this tissue are the storage and regulation of its homeostasis \n\n(Buckwalter et al., 1996b; Marks and Hermey, 1996; Cowin and Doty, 2007). The \n\nbalance of calcium in the body, through calcium diffusion in and out of the bone, is \n\nregulated by numerous factors. Local factors including cytokines, growth factors and \n\nprostaglandins, and calcitropic hormones, such as, parathyroid, vitamin D and \n\ncalcitonin, are involved in bone-cell functions (Marks and Hermey, 1996; Buckwalter et \n\nal., 1996a). However, calcium homeostasis depends not only on the bone and on the \n\nreferred factors, but also on kidneys and the gastrointestinal track (Vander et al., \n\n2001b). Accordingly, bone mineralization occurs only when calcium and phosphorous \n\nlevels in the blood are sufficient for bone normal deposition (Saladin, 2004). \n\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) has direct effect in bone tissue, since it stimulates \n\nosteoclastic function and therefore, the release of calcium from bone to the \n\nbloodstream (Buckwalter et al., 1996a; Fitzpatrick and Bilezikian, 1999).  In addition, \n\nPTH controls calcium resorption by the kidneys and promotes vitamin D synthesis \n\n(Buckwalter et al., 1996a). \n\nVitamin D final form (1,25-didydroxyvitamin D3), is synthesized in the kidneys \n\ndepending on the levels of serum calcium (Buckwalter et al., 1996a; Rossert and \n\nCrombrugghe, 1996). Despite having several actions in different cells and tissues, \n\nvitamin D is primarily associated with bone function and mineral homeostasis \n\n(Fitzpatrick and Bilezikian, 1999). It has an inductive effect in bone resorption, by \n\npromoting the differentiation of osteoclastic precursors into active osteoclasts (Suda et \n\nal., 1996; Saladin, 2004). Moreover, vitamin D inhibits PTH synthesis and secretion, and \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n13 \n \n\nplays an important role in enhancing calcium absorption in the intestine (Fitzpatrick \n\nand Bilezikian, 1999; Goltzman et al., 2004). \n\nCalcitonin, produced and secreted by the parafollicular cells of thyroid gland, is \n\nresponsible for the decrease of calcium serum levels, since it has an inhibitory effect \n\non osteoclasts (Chambers, 1991; Buckwalter et al., 1996a). The regulatory function of \n\ncalcitonin is amplified during \u2018\u2019calcium stress\u2019\u2019 periods, such as, growth, pregnancy, and \n\nlactation, therefore protecting the skeleton from excessive resorption (Vander et al., \n\n2001b). These important features have been taken into account in several studies, \n\nwhere the therapeutic utility of calcitonin in the treatment of metabolic bone diseases, \n\nlike Paget disease, hypercalcemia and osteoporosis, is investigated (Buckwalter et al., \n\n1996a; Vander et al., 2001b). \n\nBone cell function can be influenced by other hormones, such as, \n\nglucocorticoids, thyroid hormone and estrogens. An important function of \n\nglucocorticoids in bone metabolism is its inhibitory effect on bone matrix production \n\nby the osteoblasts. Thyroid hormones, thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine, enhance bone \n\nosteoclastic resorption. Finally, estrogens have a major role in bone maintenance since \n\ninhibit osteoclastic function. Thus, clinically, it is known that bone loss in \n\npostmenopausal females is associated with decreased estrogen levels (Buckwalter et \n\nal., 1996a; Suda et al., 1996).  \n\nLocal factors, including cytokines, growth factors and prostaglandins affect cell-\n\nto-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions. Cytokines and growth factors \n\nmediate cell-to-cell interaction within bone, regulating several features of bone cells \n\nduring skeletal development and in the remodeling process of the mature skeleton. \n\nProstaglandins regulate a diverse group of biological processes, including \n\ninflammation, blood flow and, ion transport across cell membranes. Additionally, \n\nprostaglandins promote formation and proliferation of osteoclasts and, subsequently \n\nhave a positive regulation on bone resorption (Rossert and Crombrugghe, 1996; \n\nBuckwalter et al., 1996a; Lorenzo and Raisz, 1999). \n\n \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n14 \n \n\nI.1.5. Bone remodeling \n\nBone is a specialized tissue responsible for body protection and locomotion. To \n\nplay these functions, bone has to be capable to respond and adapt to several \n\nmechanical stresses (Einhorn, 1996; Hill, 1998). \n\nBone remodeling is a process of continuous bone shaping through replacement \n\nof old bone by new tissue, involving the coupled actions of bone resorbing and bone \n\nforming cells (Buckwalter et al., 1996a; Lemaire et al., 2004). This adaptive \n\nphenomenon also occurs to repair microdamage caused by repeated physical stresses \n\nand loads (Lemaire et al., 2004). Therefore, during bone remodeling, differentiated \n\nosteoclasts are induced to resorb bone on a particular surface, being replaced by \n\nosteoblasts responsible for bone formation. This process is played by an association of \n\nbone cells and bone extracellular matrix, designated basic multicellular units (BMUs), \n\nwhich act geographically and chronologically separated from other BMUs keeping \n\nbone morphology unchanged  (Hill, 1998; Raggatt and Partridge, 2010).  \n\nThe triggering signal that attracts osteoclastic precursors to the microdamage \n\nsite, to start the remodeling process, is not completely understood, but seems to be \n\nassociated with osteocyte signalization through their canaliculi network along the bone \n\nafter a structural damage or with bone cell response to an unusual hormonal level \n\n(Hill, 1998; Seeman, 2008). When mature osteoclasts are at the resorption site, \n\nosteoclastogenesis begin with the renewal of the damage, creating a resorption bay in \n\nthe bone tissue. After the maximum resorption pick, osteoclasts undergo apoptosis \n\nand osteoblastic precursors are attracted to the lacunae by TGF-? and COL I released \n\nfrom the digested matrix. Then the osteoblastic precursors differentiate into \n\nosteoblasts that start bone formation until the lacunae is totally filled (Hill, 1998; \n\nRaggatt and Partridge, 2010). \n\nMoreover, the two bone remodeling events \u2013 osteoblastogenesis and \n\nosteoclastogenesis \u2013 are dependent on several mechanisms involving cytokines, \n\ngrowth factors, hormones and vitamins. A group of different cytokines namely \n\nmacrophage colony stimulating factors (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n15 \n \n\nfactor ? B ligand (RANKL), are directly related with osteoclasts differentiation, survival \n\nand expansion and, thus, with bone resorption. M-CSF and RANKL are both expressed \n\nby osteoblasts, and have their receptors on the surface of osteoclastic precursor cells, \n\nnamely c-fms and receptor activator of nuclear factor ? B (RANK). The binding of these \n\ncytokines to its receptors is the signalizing mechanism necessary to osteoclasts \n\nactivation and differentiation (Udagawa et al., 2000; Proff and R\u00f6mer, 2009). \n\nAdditionally, osteoblasts also express a soluble decoy receptor for RANKL named \n\nosteoprotegerin (OPG), which prevents RANK \u2013 RANKL connection and inhibits \n\nosteoclasts differentiation, blocking bone resorption. The OPG \u2013 RANKL \u2013 RANK \n\nbalance is so important to bone homeostasis, that several alterations on this system \n\nare related to human metabolic bone diseases (Yavropoulou and Yovos, 2008; Kohli \n\nand Kohli, 2011). \n\n \n\nI.2. Bone repair \n\nWhen exposed to an injury, usually a fracture, bone tissue reacts spontaneously \n\nby remodeling itself, through several biological events, until the normal function and \n\nmorphology are completely restored. However, there are special cases, such as large \n\nfractures, bone defects, or even pathological conditions, where this natural faculty is \n\nnot enough to regenerate the injured tissue, and so several alternative strategies \n\nshould be taken in order to repair bone tissue (Kumar et al., 2007a; Dimitriou et al., \n\n2011). \n\n \n\nI.2.1. Spontaneous bone repair \n\nAs a living tissue, bone has the ability to regenerate in response to fractures, \n\nalthough it is unique in its scarless response (Carano and Filvaroff, 2003). The repair \n\nprocess involves several cell types, including macrophages, polymorphonuclear \n\nleukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and osteoblasts (Marsh and Li, 1999). \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n16 \n \n\nIn response to fracture, there is a cell and tissue reaction, namely an \n\ninflammation phase preceding proliferative and remodeling phases (Carano and \n\nFilvaroff, 2003). When bone tissue is fractured, there is a bleeding and initially a blood \n\nclot is formed. Blood vessels permeability and volume change as a response to \n\ninflammation and as a consequence of vasodilatation several proteins, growth factors \n\nand cytokines arrive to the fracture site triggering the influx of inflammatory cells. At \n\nthe fracture gap, bone cells and bone matrix are phagocyted and substituted by \n\ngranulation tissue. This provisory tissue is continuously replaced by fibro-cartilage \n\nleading to a soft callus formation around the fracture site. Subsequently, the \n\nperiosteum osteogenic potential allows new bone cell formation and, as a result, bone \n\ntissue is formed in the internal and external layer of the callus, creating a hard callus \n\n(Marsh and Li, 1999; Seeley, 2004). The remodeling phase of bone regeneration is \n\ncharacterized by fracture callus replacement by stronger lamellar bone, until normal \n\nbone morphology and total blood supply are restored (Fig. 4) (Marsh and Li, 1999; \n\nCarano and Filvaroff, 2003). \n\nHowever, in cases of large bone fractures or defects, in pathological conditions \n\n(e.g. tumors, bacterial infections, osteonecrosis), in age related disorders like \n\nosteoporosis, and in other cases of large bone loss, bone tissue is not capable to \n\nrestore its shape and function spontaneously (Seeley et al., 2004; Kumar et al., 2007a). \n\nTo restore bone health, shape and function, surgical reconstruction is needed. \n\nTherefore, the proper strategy and bone substitute must be chosen.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4. The stages of fracture repair. (a) Hematoma formation: following injury, disruption of blood \n\nvessels leads to formation of a hematoma; (b) Soft callus formation: this stage involves the formation of \n\nnew blood vessels from pre-existing ones (angiogenesis), the external callus and the internal callus; (c) \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n17 \n \n\nHard callus formation: the callus becomes mineralized; (d) Bone remodeling: the large fracture callus is \n\nreplaced with secondary lamellar bone, and the vascular supply returns to normal (Adapted from \n\nCarano and Filvaroff, 2003). \n\n \n\nI.2.2. Strategies for bone repair \n\nBone grafting is the current treatment used to enhance bone repair process, in \n\ncases that bone cannot do it spontaneously. Thus, it can be made by replacing missing \n\nbone for natural material, either from the patient\u2019s own skeletal (autografting) or that \n\nof a donor (allografting), or for man-made synthetic materials (Finkemeier, 2002; \n\nSalgado et al., 2004a). \n\nTo restore bone architecture and functionality two different strategies can be \n\ntaken: 1) transplantation or 2) implantation (Hench, 1998). \n\nBone transplantation is the surgical procedure through which healthy and \n\nfunctional bone tissue is harvested to fill the skeletal defect. While bone autografting is \n\nthe process used when bone tissue that fills the defect is from the patient\u2019s own \n\nskeletal, bone allografting is used to fill the defect with bone tissue from living donors \n\nor cadavers (Porter et al., 2009; Dimitriou et al., 2011). \n\nDespite being currently used to treat bone defects, autografting has some \n\nlimitations. The amount of harvested tissue and the donor site pain and morbidity are \n\nthe main barriers to this procedure (Laurencin et al., 1999). Also, bone allografting, is \n\nless used than autografting because, it has some risk concerning the possibility to \n\ninduce host immune response or disease transmission (Salgado et al., 2004a ; Porter et \n\nal., 2009). \n\nTo overcome the difficulties of bone autografting and allografting, implantation \n\nof man-made biomaterials appears to be the alternative therapy to treat bone defects \n\n(Hench, 1998). Either way, the material used to adequately treat bone tissue loss, \n\nshould have certain properties, such as: biocompatibility, osteoconductivity and \n\nosteoinductivity. Hence, bone substitute should not incite an inflammatory response \n\n(biocompatibility), it should provide the adequate matrix to support bone cell \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n18 \n \n\nattachment and growth (osteoconductivity), and it also should be capable of stimulate \n\ncells to become bone forming cells (osteoinductivity) (Middleton and Tripton, 2000; \n\nAlbrektsson and Johansson, 2001; Finkemeier, 2002; Porter et al., 2009).  \n\nIn order to achieve an ideal bone graft substitute, capable of restore bone \n\nfunctionality and structure, Bone Tissue Engineering (BTE) arises as a promise to the \n\nfuture of regenerative medicine (Salgado et al., 2004a; Schieker et al., 2006).  \n\n \n\nI.2.2.1 Bone Tissue Engineering \n\nBTE is presented as an alternative to bone transplantation. It relies on the \n\nassociation of osteoconductive scaffolds, made of biocompatible materials, with cells \n\nand osteoinductive growth factors, attempting to mimic natural bone (Schieker et al., \n\n2006). Research groups try to combine knowledge from biology, physics, engineering \n\nand materials science, in order to create a dynamic structure capable of restore, \n\nmaintain or improve tissue function, structure and biochemical behavior (Hench, 1998; \n\nSalgado et al., 2004b). \n\nOne of the major challenges in BTE concerns the creation of vascularized grafts. \n\nIndeed, if the main goal is to create a construct capable of mimicking natural bone, \n\nvasculature to provide oxygen and nutrients to the engineered tissue is of the most \n\nimportance (Rivron et al., 2008). After implantation of the scaffold the spontaneous \n\ninvasion of new blood vessels is to slow and insufficient, and the deeper tissues \n\nbecame deprived of oxygen and nutrients compromising the survival of the engineered \n\nconstruct. \n\nAccordingly, several attempts to provide proper blood supply to the construct \n\nare in course. These strategies include: 1) scaffold design, which allows to choose the \n\nideal pore size and pores interconnectivity essential to the correct host cell migration \n\nand assembling in a microvascular network for the entire implanted construct; 2) a \n\ntechnique that combines the angiogenic effects of growth factors, such as, VEGF and \n\nbFGF to induce the ingrowth of host vessels into the construct, named angiogenic \n\nfactor delivery; 3) in vivo prevascularization based on prior implantation of the \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n19 \n \n\nengineered construct in a region with an artery and after total vascularization, the \n\nconstruct is harvested and reimplanted at the defect site; 4) in vitro prevascularization \n\nthat combines the construct cells with endothelial cells to create a new vascular \n\nnetwork. After formation of a prevascular network in vitro the construct is implanted \n\nand the host vasculature anastomoses with it (Rouwkema et al., 2008; Rivron et al., \n\n2008). \n\nUltimately, the combined results of each technique will provide the necessary \n\ninformation to create a successful construct with functional and mature blood vessels \n\nduring the construct life time.   \n\n \n\nI.2.2.1.1. Biomaterials \n\nIn 2009, Williams proposed a new definition of biomaterial as being \u201ca \n\nsubstance that has been engineered to take a form which, alone or as part of a \n\ncomplex system, is used to direct, by control of interactions with components of living \n\nsystems, the course of any therapeutic or diagnostic procedure, in human or veterinary \n\nmedicine\u201d.  \n\nIn BTE, bone substitutes used to treat bone defects and help bone healing \n\nprocess have in their composition biomaterials. Furthermore, and as mentioned \n\nearlier, the ideal biomaterial that composes the engineered construct should be \n\nbiocompatible, osteoconductive and osteoinductive.  It also should be able to support \n\nmechanical loads and be bioactive and bioresorbable. Meaning that, it should promote \n\nneotissue formation while it degrades, allowing the substitution of the scaffold for \n\nnewly formed bone (Navarro et al., 2008; Dorozhkin, 2010). \n\nMetals, polymers and ceramics are the usual biomaterials that can be used as a \n\nscaffold for BTE. \n\nMetals and metal alloys such as, stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloys, \n\naluminium, among others are used as permanent implants in large load bearing \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n20 \n \n\ndefects. However, metal is a bioinert material and that characteristic excludes its direct \n\nuse as a scaffold in BTE (Navarro et al., 2008). \n\nAs an alternative, there are bioactive and bioresorbable polymers from \n\nsynthetic or natural sources. Some of the currently used polymers are: polyglycolic acid \n\n(PGA), Poly (?-caprolaction) (PLC), polydioxanone (PDS), polylactide acid (PLA), \n\nhyaluronic acid, chitosan, alginats, collagen and others (Navarro et al., 2008). The use \n\nof these materials to do scaffolds in BTE relies in the fact that the polymer degradation \n\nrate can be controlled assigning high versatility to this biomaterial (Schieker et al., \n\n2006). \n\nCeramics such as glass ceramics and calcium phosphates are also adequate \n\nbiomaterials used to compose scaffolds due to their biocompatibility, \n\nosteoconductivity, osteoinductivity and high similarities with bone mineralized matrix. \n\nFurthermore, ceramics are bioactive and bioresorbable materials. One of the most \n\nused ceramics in BTE is HA (Dorozhkin, 2010; Nandi et al., 2010).  \n\nHA ceramics have different clinical applications in various forms: particles, \n\ninjectable compositions, coatings on metal implants, dense or porous blocks, \n\ncomposites with polymers, among others. HA is often selected as biomaterial for BTE \n\nbecause it acts as stable phase, with lower solubility and therefore slower resorption \n\nrate, under normal physiological conditions. Additionally, it seems that HA is the ideal \n\nbiomaterial to attract bone forming cells to seed, differentiate and assemble in the \n\nscaffold. However, scaffold properties, as surface area, roughness and porosity that \n\ngreatly influence bone forming cells behavior, along with a poor fatigue resistance, \n\nwhich inhibits the use of HA scaffolds to load bearing applications, are problems to \n\novercome (Cai and Tang, 2008; Dorozhkin, 2010).  \n\n Thus, taking into account the current progress in the nanotechnology field, \n\nthere have been advances in the synthesis and study of nanoHA applied to BTE (Table \n\n2). In fact, several methods have been used to synthesize HA nanoparticles, including \n\nhydrothermal synthesis, co-precipitation, microemulsion and sol-gel, in order to mimic \n\nbone natural crystals, in shape, dimensions and composition (Zhang and Gon\u00e7alves, \n\n1997; Kweh et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006).  \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n21 \n \n\nNanoHA resemblance with natural bone minerals enhances the bioceramics \n\nbiological and mechanical role. It is also known that nanosized materials (<100 nm) \n\nhave large surface-to-volume ratio, which means that the smaller the particle the \n\ngreater the surface area. Additionally, compared to microstructured particles, nanoHA \n\nparticles present higher surface roughness and smaller porosity, which positively \n\ninfluence osteoinduction, osteoblastic functions and the interactions between the \n\nsurface and serum proteins (Dorozhkin, 2009; Zhou and Lee, 2011).  \n\nSeveral studies performed on osteoblastic cells with microHA and nanoHA have \n\ndemonstrated the advantages in the use of nanoparticles. Thus, it has been proved \n\nthat nanoHA is an adequate material to work in BTE, because it enhances the cellular \n\nresponse, promoting higher cellular adhesion, proliferation, migration, as well as, \n\nmatrix mineralization around the implant, known as osseointegration, when compared \n\nto microHA (Guo et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2010; Laranjeira et al., 2010; \n\nEl-Fattah et al., 2010). The incoming information about the role of nanoHA reveals the \n\nimportance of this biomaterial in future clinical application. \n\nTable 2: Studies that used nanoHA, in vitro and in vivo, for BTE. \n\nType of study \n \n\nMaterial tested Main results References \n\n \nIn vitro \n\nMG-63 osteoblast-\nlike cells \n\nNanoHA  microspheres \n\nAfter 7 days of culture, nanoHA \nmicrospheres were totally covered \nwith osteoblasts exhibiting their \ntypical cuboidal morphology. \n\nMateus et \nal., 2008. \n\n \nIn vitro \n\nBone mesenchymal \nstem cells (MCS) and \nosteosarcoma cells \n\n(U2OS) \n\nFilms with different sized \nnanoHA particles (np-20; \nnp-40; np-80) \n\nMSC adhere and grow onto nanoHA \nfilms covering the surfaces after 7 \ndays of culture.  \nThe number of cells covering np-20 \nHA film was higher than that on np-\n40 and np-80 HA films. \nNanoHA films had an inhibitory \neffect in U2OS growth and \nproliferation. \n\nCai et al., \n2007. \n\nIn vitro \nHuman osteoblasts \n\n(HOBs) \n\nNanoHA and microHA \ndisks \n\nNanoHA surface promotes better \ncellular adhesion then microHA. \nAfter 7 days of culture cell number \nis higher on nanoHA disks. \nNanoHA disks presented significant \nenhancement in matrix \nmineralization, after 14 days of \nculture, compared to microHA. \n\nGuo et al., \n2007. \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n22 \n \n\nTable 2 (continued) \n\n \n \n\nIn vitro \nMG-63 osteoblast-\n\nlike cells \n\n \n \n\nGranules of nanoHA and \nmicroHA agglomerates \n\nHigher cellular adhesion and \nproliferation achieved in nanoHA \ngranules, than in microHA, after 6 \ndays of culture. \nCells in culture expressed the \ntypical osteoblastic markers (ALP; \nCOL I; BMP-2; OPG; M-CSF). \n\n \n \nLaranjeira et \nal., 2010. \n\nIn vitro \nMG-63 osteoblast-\n\nlike cells \n\nFilms with different sized \nnanoHA (np-20; np-80) \n\nand microHA \n\nCompared to microHA, nanoHA films \npromote superior osteoblastic \nproliferation. \nAfter 5 days of culture, cell number \nwas higher on nanoHA than in \nmicroHA and, np-20 shows to be the \nmost effective on cellular growth and \ndifferentiation. \n\n \n \n \nShi et al., \n2009. \n\nIn vivo \nRabbits with \n\ninduced bone \ndefects \n\nNanoHA artificial bone \nwith different pore sizes \n\nGreat osteogenic potential of \nnanoHA combined with the adequate \npore size enhances the ability of \nbone repair. \nAfter 12 weeks, the implanted \nmaterial was completed degraded \nand bone morphology and \nfunctionality was restored.   \n\n \n \n \nZhu et al., \n2009. \n\n \nIn vivo \n\nRats with induced \nbone defects \n\nNanoHA and microHA \npastes \n\nNanoHA paste revealed to be a great \nsurface to cell attachment, \ndifferentiation and proliferation. \nAfter 3 weeks of study, the amount \nof the newly formed bone around \nthe biomaterial surface was higher in \nnanoHA than in microHA. \n\n \n \n \nEl-Fattah et \nal., 2010. \n\nIn vivo \nRabbits with \n\ninduced bone \ndefects \n\nArtificial bones made of \nnanoHA powder (<100 \n\n?m) and HA \n\nAfter 12 weeks, the defect filled with \nnanoHA was completely repaired. \nThus, the biomaterial was degraded \nand bone morphology and function \nwas restored. \nCompared to nanoHA, HA artificial \nbone presented slower degradation, \nand promoted only partial bone \nrepair. \n\n \n \n \nZhu et al., \n2010. \n\n \n\nI.2.2.1.2 Cells \n\nCell type is another important element in tissue engineering.

In sum, in vitro studies are performed to understand the material \n\nbiological performance (Teixeira et al., 2009). \n\nDuring in vitro studies for BTE, several types of cells can be chosen. Table 3 \n\ngives an overview about the main cell types used during in vitro studies for BTE. Bone \n\nforming cells, named osteoblasts, are major actors during bone remodeling and repair \n\nprocess, whereat it is important to study the osteoblastic behavior in the presence of \n\nbiomaterials. Additionally, taking the importance of scaffold vascularization into \n\naccount, in vitro studies with isolated endothelial cells or co-culture of osteoblasts and \n\nendothelial cells, may also provide important information about the scaffold \n\ndevelopment for BTE (Grellier et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nTable 3: Different cell types used in BTE and their characteristics. \n\nCell Type Characteristics  References \n\nOsteosarcoma cell \nlines \n\nDerived from bone tumors; \nPresents osteoblastic features; \nUsed as osteoblastic models; \nEasy to culture; \nPresent high differentiation rate ; \nLong life-span; \nUsed during the first stage in vitro tests, since these cells \nhave predisposition to become neoplastic and form \ntumors in the recipient. \n\nPautke et al., 2004. \n \nNotingher et al., \n2004. \n \nGomes and Reis, \n2004. \n\nMature \nosteoblasts \n\nMature cells obtained from:  \npatient\u2019s own bone tissue (autologous cells);  \nnormal donors of the same (allogenic cells) or different \nspecies (xenogenic cells). \nFew cells available for immediate use; \nNeed for in vitro expansion; \nLow expansion potential; \nTime consuming method. \n\nChatterjeia et al., \n2010. \n \nSalgado et al., \n2004b. \n \nGomes and Reis, \n2004. \n\nEmbryonic stem \ncells (ESC) \n\nDerived from the inner mass of the blastocyst; \nUnlimited source of pluripotent cells with self-renewal \ncapacity; \nUncommitted cells which need programming to be \ndirected into specific cell progeny; \nAble to originate: osteoblasts, chondrocytes, endothelial \ncells, neurons, hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells, etc.   \n\nKhaled et al., 2011. \n \nSalgado et al., 2004a. \n \nArpornmaeklong et \nal., 2010. \n\n \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n24 \n \n\nTable 3 (continued) \n\nMesenchymal stem \ncells (MSC) \n\nCells from the non-hematopoietic fraction of bone \nmarrow; \nMultipotent cells; \nHigh differential potential; \nCompetence to differentiate into osteoblasts, \nchondrocytes and endothelial cells; \nSelf-renewal ability; \nCan be extensively expanded in vitro; \nSuitable for transplantation: immunosuppressive effects. \n\nKanitkar et al., \n2011. \n \nChatterjea et al., \n2010. \n \nKhaled et al., \n2011. \n\nEndothelial \nprogenitor cells \n\nIsolated from: peripheral blood; bone marrow; fat tissue; \nFast in vitro expansion; \nHigh proliferative rate; \nAble to differentiate into mature endothelial cells. \n\nHristov et al., \n2003. \nLuttun et al., \n2002. \nZisch, 2004. \nSantos and Reis, \n2010. \n\nMature endothelial \ncells \n\nIsolated from: umbilical cord; skin; fat tissue; saphenous \nvein; \nLow availability; \nLow in vitro proliferation capacity; \nPhenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity in different \ntissues might generate different responses. \n\nSantos and Reis, \n2010. \n \nUrbich and \nDimmeler, 2004. \n\n \n\nOsteoblasts \n\nMG-63 cells, osteoblasts-like cells from a human osteosarcoma cell line, are \n\noften used as cellular models to test the biomaterial biocompatibility (Schwartz et al., \n\n1999; Zhang et al., 2010; Ko et al., 2011). Despite being derived from malignant bone \n\ntumor, MG-63 cells are currently used during biomaterials in vitro tests, because they \n\nare easy to culture, present a high proliferation rate and have a long life-span \n\n(Notingher et al., 2004). In addition, this cell line has osteoblastic features, such as, \n\npolygonal shape with filipodia extensions, and expresses several specific osteoblastic \n\ndifferentiation markers, such as ALP, COL I, Runx-2, OC, OPG, BMP-2 and M-CSF genes \n\n(Laranjeira et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010). \n\nEndothelial cells \n\nECs are the main component of the inner layer of every blood vessel in the \n\nbody. These cells are directly involved in the process of new blood vessels formation \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n25 \n \n\n(angiogenesis), as well as, during immune and inflammatory responses (Kumar et al., \n\n2007b). It is worth to notice that these events happen during scaffold pre-\n\nvascularization processes or after scaffold implantation in the body (Rouwkema et al., \n\n2008). Regarding this, in vitro studies allow us to have more information about the \n\nscaffold biocompatibility, as well as, cell performance when in contact with the \n\nbiomaterial.  \n\nHuman dermal microvascular ECs (HDMEC), isolated from juvenile foreskin are \n\noften used during in vitro testes (Unger et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2008; Santos et al., \n\n2009). In vitro, these cells present the typical polygonal and elongated shape. \n\nFurthermore, HDMEC can be identified by imunohistochemestry, using antibodies for \n\nendothelial markers, such as, adherens molecules (e.g. VE-cadherin) and platelet-\n\nendothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM or CD31), which also proves the polygonal \n\nshape of these cells (Peters et al., 2008).  \n\nCo-culture system \n\nIn order to create a metabolic-active bone graft, with proper vascular network \n\nallowing metabolic waste products removal, as well as, the access to nutrients, oxygen, \n\nprecursor cells and biological mediators, it is relevant to understand the importance of \n\ncellular interactions between osteoblastic cells and ECs (Rivron et al., 2008; Grellier et \n\nal., 2009). Thus, in vitro co-culture system with heterogeneous cell types provides \n\nsignificant information about in vivo interactions between cells.  \n\nAccordingly, communication between osteoblasts and ECs can happen in two \n\nways: 1) diffusion of soluble factors produced by one of the cell types which will \n\nactivate a specific receptor on the target cell, or 2) direct cytoplasmatic contact \n\nthrough gap junctions. In the first case, osteoblasts and ECs produce growth factors \n\nwhich affect the growth and differentiation of both cell types (Grellier et al., 2009). \n\nExamples of these growth factors produced are VEGF produced by osteoblasts and \n\naffecting ECs, as well as, BMP-2 and IGF produced by ECs to influence osteoblasts \n\nproliferation and differentiation (Rivron et al., 2008). The other type of communication \n\n(gap junctions) allows a direct signalizing process through cytoplasmatic connective \n\nchannels, which allow the passage of second messengers. These messengers that will \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n26 \n \n\naffect gene expression on the adjacent cell are molecules, such as cAMP, cGMP, Ca2+ \n\nand others (Grellier et al., 2009). \n\nRegarding this issue, several studies have shown that the communication \n\nbetween cells during in vitro co-culture system, influence the behavior of both cell \n\ntypes. In fact, it has been observed upregulation of COL I and enhanced VEGF \n\nproduction by osteoblasts, along with the increased viability and proliferation of ECs, \n\nwhen these two cell types are cultured in direct contact (Unger et al., 2007; Hofmann \n\net al., 2008). Furthermore, studies involving co-culture in 3-D scaffolds demonstrated \n\nthe ECs ability to self-assemble into stable microvessel-like structures with lumen, \n\nsurrounded by osteoblasts during long term periods (Unger et al., 2007; Hofmann et \n\nal., 2008; Santos et al., 2009a). In sum, the knowledge of cell behavior in co-culture \n\nsystems motivate further studies about cell-to-cell communication and the advantages \n\nof this system to properly mimic the in vivo environment concerning bone tissue. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n27 \n \n\nI.3. Objectives \n\n \n\nThe experimental work presented in this thesis, aims to characterize the \n\nbiological profile of nanohydroxyapatite (nanoHA) particles, synthesized by \n\nhydrothermal method, on isolated and co-cultured human osteosarcoma cell line (MG-\n\n63) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. \n\nThe in vitro studies performed assemble information about the mechanism of \n\nnanoHA internalization and the kinetics of nanoHA within cellular compartments.

Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles preparation and characterization; \n\nII. In vitro biological studies with MG-63 osteoblast-like cells; \n\nIII. In vitro biological studies with human dermal microvascular endothelial \n\ncells; \n\nIV. In vitro biological studies in a co-culture system with MG-63 osteoblast-like \n\ncells and HDMEC. \n\n \n\nHA powders were prepared through hydrothermal synthesis followed by \n\nsterilization process. The structural/chemical characterization was performed by X-ray \n\ndiffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron \n\nmicroscopy. \n\n \n\nDifferent concentrations of HA nanoparticles were prepared through dilution \n\nprocess in endothelial culture basal medium. \n\n \n\nIn vitro biological studies of isolated and co-cultured MG-63 osteoblast-like cells \n\nand HDMEC in the presence, of different ranges of HA nanoparticles, were performed \n\nthrough MTT assay, confocal laser scanning microscopy and transmission electron \n\nmicroscopy.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n30 \n \n\nII.1. Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles  \n\n \n\nII.1.1. Hydrothermal synthesis of HA nanoparticles  \n\nHydrothermal synthesis (HS), carried out at 180\u00b0C was the chosen method to \n\nsynthesize HA nanoparticles. In order to do that, a supersaturated solution was \n\nprepared by mixing citric acid (Riedel-deHa\u00ebn, 99.5% purity), calcium nitrate (Riedel-\n\ndeHa\u00ebn, 99% purity) (0.2 M) and ammonium hydrogen phosphate (Merck, 99% purity) \n\n(0.2 M) as follows: an aqueous citric acid solution (0.6 M) was added with small \n\namounts of ammonia (Riedel-deHa\u00ebn) (25 vol. %) for pH adjustment to 8.12 and then \n\nmixed with appropriated amounts of calcium nitrate and of ammonium hydrogen \n\nphosphate solutions. The mixture of all the reagents was performed under continuous \n\nstirring, at room temperature. The resulting homogeneous \n\n(calcium/citrate/phosphate) solution was transferred to a tightly sealed Teflon vessel \n\nin a stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180\u00b0C in an oven during 24 hours. After 24 \n\nhours the vessel was cooled and the precipitated particles were collected by filtering \n\nthe suspensions through a 0.22 ?m Millipore and washed repeatedly with deionized \n\nwater. The obtained powders were dried in a desiccator. Finally, the prepared particles \n\nwere sterilized in a stainless steel autoclave at 120\u00b0C during 20 minutes, according to a \n\nstandard procedure in biomedical applications (Dorozhkin et al., 2000). After \n\nsterilization HS particles were labeled as HSster. \n\n \n\nII.1.2. Structural/chemical characterization  \n\nThe microstructure and morphological features of the HS nanoparticles, before \n\nand after sterilization, were evaluated with a Hitachi H-9000-NA transmission electron \n\nmicroscopy (TEM) operating at 200 kV. The particle samples for TEM observation were \n\nprepared by dropping an ethanolic suspension of the particles kept under ultrasonic \n\nstirring onto a formvar coated copper grid. The grid was subsequently air dried for \n\nTEM observation. \n\n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n31 \n \n\nThe specific surface area (SSA) of the precipitated particles was determined by \n\nN2 adsorption using a Micromeritics \u2013 Gemini 2370 V5 equipment. The samples were \n\nthoroughly degassed at 120\u00b0C for 24 hours before nitrogen adsorption. The particle \n\nSSA was determined based on the multipoint Brunauer-Emmett-Teller isotherm (BET) \n\n(Schneider, 1995). \n\nThe crystalline phases of the precipitated particles (HS and HSster) were \n\nidentified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, using an X-ray diffractometer, \n\nmodel Rigaku OMG-VH with a Cu-K? incident radiation (1.5405 \u00c5). The diffraction \n\npatterns were recorded at room temperature over the 2? range of 10\u201370\u00b0 at 3\u00b0/min, in \n\ncontinuous mode. \n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed for identifying \n\nthe functional groups, using a Mattson Galaxy 3020 spectrophotometer. The test \n\nsamples were prepared by mixing 2 mg of HA powder with 300 mg of spectroscopic-\n\ngrade KBr (Merck) and pressing the mixture as a disk. The infrared spectra were \n\nrecorded in transmittance mode in the region of 4000-400 cm\n?1\n\n with a resolution of 4 \n\ncm\n?1\n\n.  \n\nThe measurement of the electrophoretic mobility of the particles in aqueous \n\nsuspensions was performed at 25\u00b0 C, using Malvern equipment with a zetasizer nano \n\nseries 6.00 software. A small amount of the particles was suspended in a 2x10\n-3\n\n M KCl \n\nsolution in order to ensure a constant electrical double-layer thickness and then \n\nallowed to equilibrate for two hours before measurement.  \n\n \n\nII.1.3. Preparation of different concentrations of HA nanoparticles \n\nIn order to assess the biological profile of HSster nanoHA particles on isolated \n\nand co-cultured osteoblastic and endothelial cells, it was necessary to prepare \n\ndifferent ranges of nanoparticles. Therefore, a suspension containing 20 mL of \n\nendothelial culture basal medium and 20 mg of HSster nanoHA particles was prepared \n\nunder continuous stirring. Then, the suspension was divided in 20 rates of 1 mL each, \n\nwhich will correspond to the culture final concentration of 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n. The other \n\n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n32 \n \n\nintended nanoHA particles concentrations (1 ?g mL\n-1 \n\nand 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\n) were prepared \n\nafter dilution of the 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\nsuspension. \n\n \n\nII.2. Cell culture \n\n \n\nII.2.1. Monoculture of MG-63 cells  \n\nMG-63 osteoblast-like cells were purchased to ATCC (American Type Culture \n\nCollection) and were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium, alpha modification (?-\n\nMEM; Eagle) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Sciencell), 1% ascorbic acid, 1% \n\npenicillin-streptomycin and 1% fungizone. The cultures were maintained until near \n\nconfluency in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) at 37\u00b0C. \n\nFor subculture, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Gibco, UK), \n\nenzymatically released with trypsin solution (0.05% trypsin, 0.25% EDTA) at 37\u00b0C for 5 \n\nminutes, and counted. Then, cells were seeded at a density of 10\n3 \n\ncell cm\n-2 \n\nin standard \n\ntissue culture plates, previously coated with bovine fibronectin (made in Dulbecco\u2019s \n\nphosphate buffered saline - DPBS). After 48 hours, medium was removed and fresh \n\nendothelial culture basal medium containing 10% of nanoHA particles, in a range of 1 \n\n?g mL\n-1\n\n-100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n, was added to the adherent cells.  \n\n \n\nII.2.2. Monoculture of Human Dermal Microvascular Endothelial Cells  \n\nHuman dermal microvascular endothelial cells were purchased to Sciencell and \n\nwere cultured in Endothelial Culture basal Medium (ECM; Sciencell) containing 5% of \n\nFBS (Sciencell), 10 units/mL of Penicillin, 10 ?g mL\n-1 \n\nof Streptomycin (P/S solution, \n\nSciencell) and endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS, Sciencell). Incubation was \n\ncarried out in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) at 37\u00b0C. \n\n75 cm\n2\n cell culture flasks were previously coated with bovine fibronectin (made in \n\nDPBS). \n\nAfter passage 3, HDMEC were washed with PBS (Gibco, UK), enzymatically \n\nreleased with trypsin solution (0.05% trypsin, 0.25% EDTA) at 37\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and \n\nseeded at a density of 2x10\n4\n cell cm\n\n-2\n in standard tissue culture plates, previously \n\n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n33 \n \n\ncoated with bovine fibronectin (made in DPBS). After 48 hours, medium was replaced \n\nby fresh medium containing 10% of nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL\n-1\n\n-100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n). \n\n \n\nII.2.3. Co-culture of MG-63 cells and HDMEC \n\nMG-63 cells and HDMEC, in passage 3, were co-cultured at a density of 10\n3\n cell \n\ncm\n-2\n\n and 2x10\n4\n cell cm\n\n-2\n respectively, in endothelial culture medium. After 48 hours, \n\nmedium was removed and new medium containing 10% of nanoHA particles (1?g mL\n-1\n\n- \n\n100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n) was added. Co-cultures were performed in standard culture plates, \n\npreviously coated with bovine fibronectin (made in DPBS). \n\n \n\nMonocultures and co-cultures were maintained for 14 days at three \n\nexperimental conditions: i) absence of nanoHA (control); ii) addition of nanoHA at day \n\n1 (characterization of the cultures at days 2, 7 and 14); iii) addition of nanoHA at day 7 \n\n(characterization of the culture at days 8 and 14). Culture medium was changed \n\nregularly. Cell response was characterized as follow. \n\n \n\n \n\nII.3. Biological characterization \n\n \n\nII.3.1. Cell viability/proliferation \n\nMTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) \n\ncolorimetric analysis was used to estimate cell viability/proliferation in the presence of \n\nnanoHA (1 ?g mL\n-1 \n\n\u2013 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n).  \n\nMTT assay measures the redox activity of living cells that enables the \n\nconversion of the yellow substrate MTT to purple needle-like formazan crystals \n\naccumulated at the cell surface. The solubilization of these crystals is made by \n\ndimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), allowing the determination of absorbance values after \n\nincubation. The cell ability of substrate endocytosis and reduction, along with the \n\nintensity of the color formed, is directly related to the number of viable cells, and thus \n\nto their proliferation in vitro (Liu et al., 1997; Abe and Matsuki, 2000).  \n\n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n34 \n \n\nFor this propose cells were seeded in 96-well plates, where four replicates were set \n\nup for each sample (Fig. 5). At the culture periods tested (2, 7, 8 and 14 days), 10 ?L \n\nMTT were added to each well and incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C.  Then, the MTT \n\nmedium was discarded and the formazan salts were dissolved with 100 ?L DMSO. \n\nAbsorbance was measured at 550 nm in a ELISA reader (Synergy HT, Biotek). \n\n \n\nII.3.2. Morphologic evaluation \n\nFor the morphological evaluation, cells exposed to nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL\n-1 \n\n\u2013 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n), were immunostained and analyzed by Confocal Laser Scanning \n\nMicroscopy (CLSM). \n\nImmunostaining is a staining method, used to detect a specific protein and it is \n\nbased on the antigen-antibody immune reaction. Direct methods using one antibody \n\nconjugated with a label, or indirect methods using two antibodies with the secondary \n\nantibody labeled, are used to trigger a specific immune reaction. Labels are used for \n\nvisualization of the antigen-antibody reaction (Ausubel et al., 2003; Ramos-Vara, \n\n2005). \n\nImmunofluorescent staining of F-actin cytoskeleton filaments, CD31 and nuclei \n\nBriefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates, where two replicates were set up \n\nfor each sample (Fig. 5). At the culture periods tested (2, 7, 8 and 14 days), samples \n\nwere washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde (methanol free) for 15 \n\nminutes to preserve the antigens. Then, samples were permeabilized with 0.1% triton \n\nfor 5 minutes, to ensure the penetration of the antibodies into the cells, and incubated \n\nin 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA/PBS) with 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n RNAse for 60 minutes at room \n\ntemperature, blocking non-specific bindings of the primary antibodies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n35 \n \n\nMonocultures of MG-63 cells \n\nF-actin filaments were stained with Alexafluor-conjugated phalloidin, diluted \n\n1:100 in 1% BSA/PBS for 60 minutes, at room temperature in dark. Nuclei were \n\ncounterstained with 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\npropidium iodide diluted in PBS for 10 minutes.  \n\n \n\nMonocultures of HDMEC and co-cultures \n\nCultures were incubated for 45 minutes with primary CD31 (PECAM-1) antibody \n\ndiluted 1:100 in 1% BSA/PBS. Then, samples were labeled with secondary antibody \n\nanti-mouse Alexafluor diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA/PBS for 45 minutes. After that period, \n\nsamples were counterstained with 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\npropidium iodide for 10 minutes.  \n\nFinally, all samples were washed with PBS and covered with Vectashield and \n\nstored at 4\u00b0 C in dark. CSLM images were acquired on Leica TCP SP2 AOBS at days 2, 7 \n\nand 14. \n\n               \n\nFigure 5.

At the culture time tested (2, 7, 8 and 14 days) samples were washed twice \n\nwith sodium cacodylate buffer (0.2 M) and fixed with glutaraldehyde (2.5%) for 2 hours \n\nat room temperature. After that period, samples are washed twice with sodium \n\ncacodylate buffer (0.2M). Adherent cells were enzymatically released (0.05% trypsin, \n\n0.25% EDTA) and the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min. The \n\nresulting pellet was fixed with glutaraldehyde (2.5%), post fixed with osmium tetroxide \n\n(2%), dehydrated in graded ethanol and later embedded in Epon, using routine \n\nmethods. Ultra-thin (100 nm) sections mounted in copper grids (300 Mesh) were \n\ncontrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for TEM analysis (Zeiss EM 10A) at an \n\naccelerating voltage 60Kv.  \n\n \n\nII.5. Statistical analysis \n\nStatistic analysis was performed using the program: Statistical Package for the \n\nSocial Sciences (SPSS) v.19.0. Four replicates of each sample for the MTT quantitative \n\nassay were performed. The results were expressed as the arithmetic mean \u00b1 standard \n\ndeviation. Dunnet multiple comparison statistical test was also performed to variance \n\nanalysis. Analized results with p ? 0.05 were accounted as statistically significant.   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                                                                   \n\n   CHAPTER III \n\nRESULTS \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n RESULTS \n\n38 \n \n\nIII.1.

Moreover, XRD peaks revealed high intensity \n\nexhibited by HS nanoparticles, indicating high crystallinity. Also, after sterilization, \n\nnanoHA particles exhibited an increased intensity of XRD peaks. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

The examined samples exhibit the main vibration bands normally \n\nattributed to HA namely those detected at 472, 563, 601, 962 cm\n-1\n\n and in the 1030-\n\n1092 cm\n-1 \n\nrange due to the bending vibration of O-P-O bond (Fleet, 2009).

In vitro biological studies of MG-63 cells \n\n \n\nCell viability/proliferation  \n\nViability/proliferation of MG-63 cells cultured for 14 days in the absence (control) and \n\nin the presence of nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL\n-1 \n\n\u2013 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n), was assessed by the MTT \n\nassay (Fig. 10). Results indicate that in control conditions cells proliferated throughout \n\nthe 14-day culture period, especially during the first week (Fig. 10). Addition of \n\nnanoparticles at day 1 (Fig. 10 A) caused a slight inhibition on cell viability/proliferation \n\nat day 7, particularly at the highest concentration (100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n; p ? 0.05). After 14 days \n\nof culture in the presence of nanoHA particles, cultures exhibited a well defined dose-\n\ndependent profile, meaning that the higher the concentration the higher the \n\nviability/proliferation (Fig. 10 A). These effects were more significant (p ? 0.05) for the \n\nconcentrations of 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\n and 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n. Addition of nanoparticles at day 7 (Fig. \n\n10 B) did not cause any significant change on cell viability/proliferation, compared to \n\nthe control. 24 hours after the addition of nanoHA particles, day 8(7), cultures \n\npresented stable values of cell viability/proliferation. Also, at day 14 cultures \n\nmaintained in the presence of nanoparticles exhibit some negligible differences \n\ncompared to the control culture (Fig. 10 B), not showing the dose-dependent profile as \n\ncultures presented on Figure 10 A. \n\n\n\n RESULTS \n\n42 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

Cells exposed to nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL\n-\n\n1 \n\u2013 100 ?g mL\n\n-1\n), added at day 1 or at day 7, exhibited the similar appearance and the \n\nsame pattern of cell growth (Fig. 11B). At day 7, it was observed a slight dose-\n\ndependent inhibition, reflected by a lower intensity of the F-actin at the cell limits \n\n(Figs. 11B b-d), followed by an increase at day 14 (Figs. 11B f-h). Additionally, after 14 \n\ndays of culture all samples presented the formation of a continuous cell layer, with the \n\nF-actin cytoskeleton stained intensively at the cell limits (Figs. 11B e-k). \n\n\n\n RESULTS \n\n43 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 11.

Also, Table 5 presents semi-quantitative \n\nresults obtained after evaluation of TEM images of the MG-63 cells cultured with 10 ?g \n\nml\n-1\n\n nanoHA during the time periods tested. Cultures performed in the presence of \n\nnanoHA added at day 1 were evaluated at days 2, 7 and 14, while cultures exposed to \n\nnanoparticles from day 7 were evaluated at days 8(7) and 14(7).  \n\nMG-63 cells cultured with 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\n nanoHA presented great internalization of \n\nnanoparticles during the first week of culture, when those were added at day 1 (Table \n\n5). The uptake of the particles occurred by the emission of pseudopods-like projections \n\nsurrounding the nanoparticles and entrapping them inside intracellular vesicles (Fig. \n\n12a). Moreover images show that the nanoparticles are organized in aggregates inside \n\nvesicles (Figs. 12a, b and d); isolated nanoparticles were not detected either in the \n\ncytosol, cell nucleus or in other organelles. When nanoHA was added at day 7, cells \n\npresented less loaded vesicles at days 8(7) and 14(7), compared to that seen with the \n\naddition of nanoparticles at day 1 (Table 5). \n\n Additionally, after 14 days of culture, it was noticed several cells exhibiting \n\nsigns of apoptosis, such as cellular rounded shape, condensed chromatin at nuclear \n\nperiphery and cytoplasmatic vacuolization (Fig. 12c).

Control cultures proliferation increased \n\nduring the culture period tested, a significant increase occurred specially at the first \n\nweek. Addition of nanoHA particles at day 1 caused concentration-dependent \n\ndeleterious effects on cell growth on day 7, with statistically significant differences (p ? \n\n0.05) between the higher concentrations (10 ?g mL\n-1 \n\nand 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n) and control (Fig. \n\n13A). Culture proliferation continued until day 14, whereas the same concentration-\n\ndependent decreased profile was exhibited (Fig. 13A). Additionally, cultures \n\nmaintained for 14 days with the addition of nanoparticles at day 7 (Fig. 13B) also \n\nexhibited a concentration-dependent decrease on cell viability/proliferation.

The immunofluorescent staining revealed the characteristic \n\npolygonal and elongated shape of HDMEC, a well defined nucleus, cell to cell contacts \n\nand the formation of a continuous cell layer by days 7 and 14, in the absence of \n\nnanoparticles (Figs. 14 a and e). Moreover, CLSM images showed that the addition of \n\nnanoparticles at day 1 caused a time and dose-dependent decrease in the cell growth, \n\nreflected by the lower intensity of the CD31 at the cell limits and also by the presence \n\nof voids on the cell culture plates (Figs. 14 b-d; f-h). Cultures exposed to 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n \n\nnanoHA particles exhibited a marked cell number decrease after 14 days of culture \n\n(Fig. 14 h). Furthermore, a dose-dependent decrease in the cell growth was also \n\nobserved when nanoparticles were added to the cultures at day 7, whereas samples \n\nexhibited a decreasing pattern regarding the number of cells and the intensity of the \n\nimmunofluorescent staining of the cell limits (Figs. 14 i-k). \n\n \n\nParticle internalization and kinetics \n\nUltrastructural images obtained by TEM (Fig. 15), reveal nanoparticles \n\ninternalization and kinetics performed by HDMEC in the concentration of 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\n. \n\nTable 6 summarizes the results obtained after evaluation of TEM images. Cultures \n\nwere evaluated at days 2, 7 and 14, when nanoHA were added at day 1, and at days \n\n8(7) and 14(7), when nanoparticles were added at day 7.  \n\nCells cultured in the presence of nanoHA, added at day 1, displayed a high \n\ninternalization of nanoparticles, which were stored in huge loaded vesicles (Fig. 15 and \n\nTable 6) during the first days of culture. After day 7 nanoHA uptake and the number of \n\n\n\n RESULTS \n\n48 \n \n\nloaded vesicles started to decrease with the culture time (Table 6).

The addition of nanoHA particles at day 1 (Fig. 16A) caused a slight \n\ninhibition on cell viability/proliferation at day 7, with significant statistically differences \n\nbetween the concentrations of 10 and 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n and the control (p ? 0.05). \n\nMeanwhile, at day 14, cultures presented a statistically significant increase in \n\nviability/proliferation, compared to the control cultures (1 ?g mL\n-1 \n\n\u2013 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n; p ? \n\n0.05). Fig. 16B shows the MTT values of the cultures performed in presence of nanoHA \n\nadded at day 7. No significant changes were observed with the addition of \n\nnanoparticles, regarding the viability/proliferation. Compared to the cultures with \n\naddition at day 1, nanoparticles did not exert a stimulatory effect when added at day 7.  \n\n\n\n RESULTS \n\n51 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 16.

At day 7, co-cultures performed in the absence of nanoHA \n\nparticles presented a dense cell layer, which consists of organized tight clusters of MG-\n\n63 cells surrounded by HDMEC, distinctively stained for CD31 (Fig. 17 a). However, at \n\nday 14 and under the same culture conditions, the two cell populations exhibited a \n\nmixed up pattern (Fig. 17 e). The addition of nanoparticles at day 1, at lower \n\nconcentrations (1 and 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\n) did not cause any substantial modification on the \n\npattern of cell growth after 7 days, compared to the control. Meanwhile, at the highest \n\nconcentration of nanoHA particles (100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n), a marked decrease on the number of \n\nendothelial cells was observed, being that the osteoblastic cells occupied most of the \n\ncell culture plate (Fig. 17 d). At day 14, cultures exposed to 1 and 10 ?g mL\n-1 \n\npresented \n\nan appearance similar to the control (Figs. 17  f  and g), while in the presence of 100 ?g \n\n\n\n RESULTS \n\n52 \n \n\nmL\n-1 \n\nthe number of osteoblastic cells was much higher than the number of endothelial \n\ncells (Fig. 17 h). Finally, the addition of nanoHA particles (1 ?g mL\n-1 \n\n\u2013 100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n), at \n\nday 7, did not cause any significant changes on the pattern of cell growth, as all the \n\ncultures exhibited a similar mixed up pattern (Figs. 17 i-k). \n\n \n\nFigure 17.

Data on Table 7 represent the results obtained after \n\nevaluation of TEM images. Cultures were evaluated at days 2, 7 and 14, when nanoHA \n\nwere added at day 1, and at days 8(7) and 14(7), when nanoparticles were added at \n\nday 7. \n\nMG-63 cells and HDMEC co-cultured for 14 days in the presence of 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\n \n\nnanoHA, exhibited lower nanoparticles uptake (Table 7), compared with the respective \n\nmonocultures, either for the addition of nanoHA at day 1 or at day 7. The process of \n\nparticle uptake was initiated by the emission of pseudopods-like projections \n\nsurrounding the nanoparticles (Fig. 18 a). Images show nanoparticles organized in \n\naggregates, inside intracellular vesicles (Figs. 18 a, b and d); isolated particles were not \n\ndetected either in the cytosol, cell nucleus or in other organelles. Additionally, Fig. 18 c \n\nreveals cellular debris in the extracellular space, which probably results from the \n\nprogressive degeneration of apoptotic bodies. During 14 days of culture, there was \n\nalso an increase of the necrotic cells, as presented on Table 7. \n\nFurthermore, Figure 19 reveals the differences in the amount of particles \n\ninternalized by monocultured and co-cultured MG-63 cells and HDMEC, 24 hours after \n\nthe addition of nanoHA particles at day 1. It is noted that the amount of particles \n\ninternalized was greater for the monocultures (Figs. 19 b and c), which presented more \n\nloaded vesicles than the co-culture system (Fig. 19 a). Also, comparing the images \n\ncorresponding to two types of monoculture at day 2, it is clear that HDMEC uptake of \n\nnanoparticles is superior than the uptake by MG-63 cells, taking into account the size \n\nof the vesicles loaded with nanoHA particles (Figs. 19 b and c). \n\n\n\n RESULTS \n\n54 \n \n\n            \n\nFigure 18.

Discussion \n\nAttempting to improve bone repair using engineered orthopedic/dental \n\nimplants, many research have focused on the synthesis of new biomaterials and their \n\nin vitro biological compatibility, before implantation. Supported by the advances in the \n\nnanotechnology field, several nanostructured HA materials have been developed to \n\nsimulate the inorganic phase of bone. This might be one way to ensure the \n\nbiomaterial\u2019s biological success. Thus, several works report that nanostructured HA \n\nfilms, granules and composite scaffolds exhibit superior osteoblastic activity than their \n\nconventional (or micron sized) counterparts (Guo et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2009; \n\nLaranjeira et al., 2010). However, information about the biological effect of isolated \n\nnanoparticles, accidentally released of these nanostructured materials to the \n\nsurrounding tissues, during or after implantation, is scarce but, of at utmost \n\nimportance (Revell, 2006; Zhang and Webster, 2009). Also, regarding the fact that \n\nangiogenesis occurs during bone development and repair, playing an active and \n\nimportant role in osteogenesis (Carano and Filvarof, 2003), endothelial cells have been \n\nused as biological models to study the potential success of the biomaterials used in \n\nBTE, namely in studies regarding the issue of scaffolds vascularization (Kirkpatrick et \n\nal., 2003; Kanczler and Oreffo, 2008). Therefore, information about the effects of \n\nnanoHA isolated particles on osteoblastic and endothelial cells, as well as on their \n\nrelationship is most relevant regarding the potential applications of nanoHA in bone \n\ntissue.  \n\nThe aim of this thesis was to characterize the biological profile of nanoHA \n\nparticles, synthesized by a hydrothermal method, on isolated and co-cultured \n\nosteoblastic and endothelial cells. In order to address this issue the synthesized \n\nnanoparticles were firstly submitted to a structural and chemical evaluation. Then, the \n\nnanoHA effect both on the viability/proliferation and pattern of cell growth, was \n\nassessed by the MTT colorimetric assay and by evaluation of CLSM images. Also, the \n\nmechanism of nanoparticle internalization and kinetics within cellular compartments \n\nwas evaluated by TEM images, of isolated and co-cultured osteoblastic and endothelial \n\ncells exposed to different concentrations of nanoHA during 14 days. \n\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \n\n58 \n \n\nHS particles exhibited similar physicochemical profile, as prepared and after \n\nsterilization. HS and HSster presented a crystalline and well defined prismatic shape, \n\nsuch features are in line with results obtained when HA is synthesized at high \n\ntemperatures (T>100\u00b0 C) (Wang et al., 2006a; Wang et al., 2006b; Wang et al., 2007; \n\nZhu et al., 2011). Regarding the steam sterilization behavior, some crystallite size \n\nvariations are also remarked but with a small extent, as documented in Table 4. Since \n\nparticle size, shape and surface area are maintained practically unchanged during \n\nautoclaving it is concluded that dissolution and re-precipitation processes, if any, were \n\nnegligible. The slight morphology variations suffered by HS particles during sterilization \n\nwere accompanied by different trends in the surface charge variation: whereas HSster \n\nparticles tended to a less negative surface charge in the pH range tested. As evidenced \n\nby FTIR results, the sterilization process induced some changes on the configuration of \n\nthe carboxylated groups absorbed on the particle surfaces. The citrate contribution to \n\nthe particle surface charge will be ruled by the amount of free carboxylated groups \n\nnegatively charged which in turn is conditioned by the citrate coordination mode to HA \n\nsurface. Moreover, it was already reported that citric acid may degrade at T>145\u00b0 C \n\n(Bednarz et al., 2011; Wyrzykowski et al., 2011) leading to reaction products that \n\ninclude different dehydroxylated or decarboxylated acids and anhydrides depending \n\non the used heating rate and temperature. It is thus hypothesized that the original \n\ncitrate ions do not exist as adsorbed species on HS particle surface but instead smaller \n\ncarboxylated ions resulting from citrate ion decomposition under the high \n\ntemperature and pressure used for HA hydrothermal synthesis. As previously referred, \n\nthe intensity of some carboxylate related bands in FTIR spectrum tended to decrease \n\nupon sterilization being thus concluded that a partial desorption of absorbed \n\ncarboxylated species might have occurred thereby explaining the small increase of \n\nHSster zeta potential.  \n\nAs observed, sterilization did not cause any relevant modification either on the \n\nmorphology, specific surface area, crystallinity or chemical structure of the tested \n\nparticles; therefore we chose to work with sterilized nanoparticles to assess their \n\nbiological effect on isolated and co-cultured osteoblastic and endothelial cells. \n\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \n\n59 \n \n\nOsteoblastic cell response to the added nanoparticles, evaluated in MG-63 cell \n\ncultures, showed that the tested concentrations of nanoHA particles did not cause \n\ndeleterious effects on cell viability/proliferation, during the time period tested. While \n\nthe addition of nanoparticles at day 1 caused a slight inhibition at day 7, after 14 days \n\ncultures exhibited a concentration-dependent increased. Also, cell \n\nviability/proliferation was not affected by the addition of nanoparticles at day 7, since \n\nresults are similar to that of the control cultures. In agreement to these results, the \n\naddition of nanoHA particles did not cause any changes either on the overall cell \n\nmorphology or on the pattern of cell growth. The existing literature regarding the use \n\nof nanoHA do not report its concentration-dependent effect on osteoblastic cell \n\ncultures, as isolated particles. Even though, the nanoHA non-toxic and osteoconductive \n\nproperties observed in our work are in line with previous in vitro studies with MG-63 \n\nosteoblast-like cells (Mateus et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2009; Laranjeira et al., 2010), MSC \n\n(Cai et al., 2007) and human osteoblasts (Guo et al., 2007), reporting the great \n\nfunctional properties of nanoHA materials, namely the ability to promote cell \n\nproliferation, adhesion and spread without causing any morphological changes. TEM \n\ndata showed that the uptake of nanoHA particles occurred via endocytosis, as \n\nexpected for the internalization of nanoparticles (Iversen et al., 2011). Images \n\nsuggested great variability in nanoHA uptake during the culture time and also \n\nregarding the different moments of nanoparticles addition. Thus, results indicated that \n\nparticle internalization occurred preferentially with the addition at day 1 and during \n\nthe first week of culture, whereas cells presented loaded vesicles; while less \n\nnanoparticles uptake occurred with the addition at day 7. These differences may be \n\nrelated to the particle-cell interactions at different moments of the culture. Several \n\nworks reported the uptake of isolated nanoHA particles in periodontal ligament cells \n\n(Sun et al., 2007), liver cancer cells (Bauer et al., 2008) and macrophages (Motskin et \n\nal, 2009) or in U2OS cells and MSC (Cai et al., 2007) and MG-63 cells (Shi et al., 2009) \n\ngrowing over nanoHA films. Regarding these studies, variability on the uptake of \n\nnanoHA was noted, this might be related to differences on the nanoparticles \n\nphysicochemical characteristics such as, shape, charge, size and surface area (Shi et al., \n\n2009; Motskin et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011), cell type (Cai et al., 2007) and cell \n\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \n\n60 \n \n\ndensity (Iversen et al., 2011). The differences observed in nanoHA uptake occurred in \n\nour work might, therefore, explain the results of the viability/proliferation assay. The \n\naddition of nanoparticles at day 1 caused a rapid internalization by the cells promoting \n\na stimulatory effect on the culture; while the less internalization observed when \n\nnanoHA was added at day 7 might explain why cultures exhibited the same \n\nviability/proliferation values as the control cultures. \n\nMoreover, the present results also provide information about the biological \n\neffect of nanoHA isolated particles on monocultured endothelial cells. Therefore, \n\ncontrol monocultures of HDMEC, maintained for 14 days in the absence of \n\nnanoparticles, exhibited an increased viability/proliferation, which was in agreement \n\nwith the CLSM observations. However, with the addition of nanoparticles, cell \n\nmetabolic activity decreased, revealing a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of \n\nnanoparticles during that culture time. The immunofluorescent staining of CD31 was \n\nperformed to assess the expression of endothelial phenotype and cell function, since \n\nthis transmembrane glycoprotein presented on the surface of endothelial cells \n\n(Michiels, 2003) is also a sensitive marker of the endothelial cell function (Kirkpatrick \n\net al., 2007). CLSM images showed a time and concentration-dependent decrease on \n\nthe intensity of the CD31 staining, meaning the loss of cell functions when exposed to \n\nnanoparticles in addition to the decreased cell number. Previous studies, using isolated \n\nnanoHA particles on endothelial cell cultures, reported the pro-angiogenic properties \n\nof this biomaterial (Pezzatini et al., 2006; Pezzatini et al., 2007). However, these \n\npositive effects were only reported for lower concentrations (under 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\n) of \n\nnanoHA particles, while at higher concentrations, cell viability was reduced and cell \n\nmorphological changes occurred, indicating the possible deleterious effects of these \n\nnanoparticles. Additionally, TEM results indicated that the internalization of \n\nnanoparticles by HDMEC was rapid and occurred at the first moments of the culture, \n\nand also indicated that particles internalization occurred preferentially when those \n\nwere added at the beginning of the culture. Therefore, when nanoparticles were \n\nadded at day 1, the uptake was rapid and at day 2 cells presented a great amount of \n\nloaded vesicles which started to decrease until reaching the end of the culture time. \n\nThese data indicate possible particle dissolution within the lysossomes, taking into \n\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \n\n61 \n \n\naccount its acidic environment, which is in line with studies in osteoblasts (Xu et al., \n\n2009) and macrophages (Motskin et al., 2009). The nanoparticles deleterious effects \n\non HDMEC cultures during the culture time might be due to the particle dissolution \n\nwithin lysossomes and the consequent release of calcium and phosphate ions to the \n\ncytoplasm at toxic concentrations. Alterations on the level of calcium in the cytosol or \n\nwithin lysossomes, have a high impact in the regulation of several vital cellular \n\nfunctions (Clapham, 2007). These facts might explain the decreased viability presented \n\nby HDMEC monocultures in the presence of nanoHA particles, but further information \n\nabout the intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways is needed.   \n\nInteraction between osteoblasts and endothelial cells has been the focus of \n\ninterest of several studies, regarding the use of these cell types co-cultured with \n\ndifferent biomaterials such as, polycaprolacton-starch scaffolds (Santos et al., 2009b; \n\nFuchs et al, 2009a), polyurethane scaffolds (Hofmann et al, 2008), silk fibroin \n\nconstructs (Fuchs et al., 2009b), 3-D porous biomaterials (Unger et al., 2007), among \n\nothers. However, despite all of that information, the exact biological effect of nanoHA \n\nisolated particles on these co-cultured cells, still neglected.  \n\nResults, concerning control co-cultures, indicate an increased metabolic activity \n\nthroughout 14 days of culture, which is in agreement with CLSM observations. Similar \n\nresults were observed by Zhang et al. in 2010, at earlier stages of the culture, \n\nendothelial cells and osteoblasts co-cultured in direct contact, promoted the \n\nosteoblastic proliferation (Zhang et al., 2010). The observed stimulatory effect is \n\nrelated with the narrow relationship between endothelial and osteoblastic cells, \n\nmediated by paracrine communication, using soluble factors (Villars et al., 2000; \n\nClarkin et al., 2008) and by direct communication through cell to cell contacts or gap \n\njunctions (Villars et al., 2002; Grellier et al., 2009). The presence of nanoparticles, \n\nadded at day 1, at smaller concentrations (1 and 10 ?g mL\n-1\n\n), did not interfere \n\nsignificantly with the communication between the two cell populations, as the pattern \n\nof cell growth are similar to the control cultures. However, cultures exposed to higher \n\nconcentration of nanoparticles (100 ?g mL\n-1\n\n) induced a different pattern, and \n\nosteoblasts occupied the majority of the culture plate while the number of endothelial \n\ncells decreased drastically. Thus, the MTT values registered for the higher \n\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \n\n62 \n \n\nconcentration of nanoparticles, concerns the majority of the osteoblastic metabolic \n\nactivity. Moreover, the addition of nanoHA particles at day 7 did not cause any \n\ndifferences either in the number of cells or in the cell proliferation/viability, compared \n\nto the control cultures. In terms of TEM results, cultures exposed to nanoHA particles \n\npresented lower particle internalization, when compared with the respective \n\nmonocultures, either for the addition at day 1 or at day 7. Thus, it is likely that the \n\ncommunication between the two cell populations affects their behavior with regard to \n\nthe nanoparticles uptake. Also, the presented results for the cellular metabolic activity \n\nseems to depend more on the relationship of these two cell types, than on the \n\npresence of the nanoHA particles. \n\n \n\nIV.2. Conclusions  \n\nHS nanoHA particles, before and after sterilization, were characterized by their \n\nmorphological features, i.e. size and shape, and also by their surface chemical \n\ncondition reflected in both zeta potential curves and FTIR spectra. After particle \n\ncharacterization, negligible differences were registered between sterilized and non-\n\nsterilized particles, evidencing HS nanoparticles chemical stability.  \n\nNanoHA particles were readily internalized by MG-63 cells and HDMEC, but \n\nHDMEC presented a higher percentage of intercellular vesicles loaded with \n\nnanoparticles. These differences may be related to the differences of effect on these \n\ntwo cell types. While nanoHA particles had a stimulatory effect on the MG-63 cells, a \n\ndeleterious effect was observed for the HDMEC cultures. Also, the effect was more \n\nsignificant when the nanoparticles were added at the beginning of the culture. Co-\n\ncultured MG-63 cells and HDMEC revealed less internalization of nanoparticles than \n\nthe respective monocultures, evidencing the importance of cellular communication for \n\nthe culture response to the presence of nanoHA particles. Due to the low toxicity and \n\nosteoconductive effect on the osteoblastic culture, nanoHA particles exhibit an \n\ninteresting profile for biomedical applications. However, further research must be \n\nmade to overcome the observed deleterious effects on endothelial cells.    \n\n\n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                CHAPTER V \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nREFERENCES \n\n64 \n \n\nAbe, K. and Matsuki, N.
