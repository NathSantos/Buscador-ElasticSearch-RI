A\nestrutura t\u00e9rmica horizontal ao longo do canal \u00e9, em grande parte, determinada\npela varia\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal da temperatura da \u00e1gua do Rio Vouga, bem como, pela\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal das condi\u00e7\u00f5es meteorol\u00f3gicas devido \u00e0 reduzida \nprofundidade. \nFoi observada a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de fortes gradientes de salinidade (relacionados \ncom a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de frentes estuarinas) numa regi\u00e3o a cerca de 7-8 km da \nembocadura do canal, observando-se a sua migra\u00e7\u00e3o numa regi\u00e3o de \naproximadamente 1 km, dependendo do regime de mar\u00e9. \nO balan\u00e7o entre o transporte de sal de natureza advectiva e difusiva foi\ncalculado, revelando que junto \u00e0 embocadura os processos f\u00edsicos que mais \ncontribuem para o transporte de sal s\u00e3o a circula\u00e7\u00e3o residual e o\naprisionamento da \u00e1gua em canais secund\u00e1rios. Junto \u00e0 foz do Rio Vouga os\ntermos devidos \u00e0 descarga fluvial e \u00e0 circula\u00e7\u00e3o gravitacional dominam o \ntransporte de sal. \nFoi calibrado e validado um modelo num\u00e9rico (Mohid, em modo 2D e 3D), \nsendo posteriormente utilizado para estudar a hidrologia do canal. Foi \nconcedida particular aten\u00e7\u00e3o ao estudo da hidrologia em condi\u00e7\u00f5es extremas \nde caudal fluvial e de mar\u00e9. Os resultados da modela\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica permitiram\nnuma primeira fase avaliar o bom desempenho do Mohid na reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o dos \nescoamentos barotr\u00f3picos na Ria de Aveiro, bem como na evolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal\ndas propriedades termohalinas da \u00e1gua. \nSob condi\u00e7\u00f5es de caudal fluvial reduzido, a din\u00e2mica do canal \u00e9 \nessencialmente dominada pela mar\u00e9. Com o aumento do caudal fluvial, a\ninflu\u00eancia da \u00e1gua doce estende-se para jusante, estratificando a coluna de \n\u00e1gua. \nAs simula\u00e7\u00f5es 3D do Canal do Espinheiro foram efectuadas para per\u00edodos \nmarcadamente diferentes de caudal fluvial e de mar\u00e9. O modelo reproduziu\nqualitativamente/quantitativamente as observa\u00e7\u00f5es de alturas de \u00e1gua,\nvelocidade e distribui\u00e7\u00f5es longitudinais de salinidade e temperatura sob um\nregime fraco a m\u00e9dio de caudal fluvial. Sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es de caudal fluvial\nelevado, os resultados mostram que o modelo subestima a estratifica\u00e7\u00e3o. \nEste estudo contribuiu para o aumento do conhecimento da din\u00e2mica do Canal\ndo Espinheiro, bem como para o desenvolvimento de um sistema num\u00e9rico \ncapaz de reproduzir e prever os processos de transporte de sal e calor. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nSalinity, water temperature, tides, river inflow, numerical model, Canal do \nEspinheiro \n \n\nabstract \n \n\nThe main objective of this work was to study the Espinheiro channel\u2019s \nthermohaline dynamics as a function of two major forcings: tides and river \ninflow using field experiments and numerical modelling simulations. \nThe salinity distribution along the channel was found closely related to the\nincoming river flow and tidal propagation. The water temperature distribution is\nrelated to the freshwater temperature seasonal variation and, due to the\nshallowness of the study area, it is also related to the seasonal variation of \nmeteorological conditions. \nThe formation of strong salinity gradients (commonly related to estuarine fronts)\nhas been found in a region between 7 and 8 km from the lagoon\u2019s mouth.\nThese gradients migrate within a region of about 1 km, depending on the tidal \nregime (spring or neap). \nThe balance between the advective and diffusive salt transport was assessed.\nNear the channel\u2019s mouth, the main contributions to the salt transport are due\nto the residual circulation (or freshwater discharge) and tidal correlation. Near\nthe channel\u2019s head, this last term is not as important as the gravitational \ncirculation. \nThe Mohid numerical model was calibrated and validated (both in 2D depth \nintegrated and 3D modes), and then used to study the channel\u2019s hydrography. \nThe channel\u2019s hydrography was studied under extreme conditions of tides and \nriver inflow. The model results allow the evaluation of Mohid in reproducing the \nbarotropic flows and the time evolution of salinity and water temperature within\nRia de Aveiro.  \nUnder low river inflow regimes, the channel\u2019s dynamics is tidally dominated. \nUnder high river inflow, the freshwater from Vouga extends its influence\ndownstream until the channel\u2019s mouth, increasing the water column\nstratification. \nThe three-dimensional simulations of the Espinheiro Channel were performed \nunder markedly different tides and river runoff. Under low-to-medium river \ninflow, the model reproduces qualitatively/quantitatively sea level height,\ncurrent velocity and longitudinal distributions of salinity and water temperature, \nunderestimating salinity stratification when the river inflow is high. \nThe residual circulation was calculated revealing an ebb-dominated channel. \nWhen the river inflow is high, the channel is nearly laterally homogeneous in\nterms of salinity and current residual velocity, presenting a two-layer structure \nwith flood currents close to the bottom and ebb currents close to the surface. \nThis study has contributed for the characterization and understanding of the\ndynamical behaviour of the Espinheiro Channel, as well as to develop a \nnumerical system of 2D and 3D numerical models able to reproduce and\npredict transport processes there occurring. \n\n \n\n\n\nContents\n\nAcknowledgements i\n\nResumo iii\n\nAbstract v\n\nList of Figures xi\n\nList of Tables xvii\n\n1

The definition\nby Cameron and Pritchard [1963] is the most used by the scientific community, but more commonly,\nfor oceanographers, engineers and natural scientist, estuaries are regions of interaction between fresh\nand salt water. However, there are over than 40 definitions of estuaries [Perillo, 1995]. In spite all\nthese definitions, Dyer [1997] refer that the most satisfactory overall definition would be an adap-\ntation of the Pritchard definition [Pritchard, 1967]: \u201dAn estuary is a semi-enclosed coastal body of\nwater which has a free connection to the open sea, extending into the river as far as the limit of\ntidal influence, and within which sea water is measurably diluted with freshwater derived from land\ndrainage\u201d.\n\nThe importance of the estuarine environments has been recognized a long time ago not only by\nthe scientific community but also by the populations who live around these areas. As an interface area\nthese ecosystems are highly variable and rich, supporting important economical and social activities.\nFactors like sewage effluents and industrial waste reduces the water quality affecting people\u2019s health\nand other activities like fisheries. Studying the thermohaline behavior within these ecosystems, and\n\nhow estuarine waters interact with the adjacent ocean provides an important insight of the behavior of\nconservative particles since salinity is considered a natural tracer. To fully characterize these systems,\nit is necessary to have an extensive data set with high spatial and temporal resolution. Due to human\nand material limitations it is difficult to describe a coastal system using only field measurements.\nA way to overleap this difficulty is to use numerical models which provide spatial and temporal\ninformation about the study area, filling the gaps existent in the field data.\n\n\n\n2 Introduction\n\nBesides scientific motivations, estuaries have an enormous historical importance, being funda-\nmental for the human development. Almost 60% of the most important cities in the world are located\nnear or around estuaries [Geophysics Study Commitee, 1997]. The scientific knowledge about these\nsystems can be used to develop solutions to several problems as the hydrographic basin\u2019s changes,\nthe identification of sedimentation areas that can affect navigation, the computation of the residence\ntime of substances within these areas (conservative and non-conservative substances), study water\nproperties patterns to support aquaculture projects and so on.\n\nRia de Aveiro is a shallow mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon, located in the north coast of\nPortugal (Figure 1.1), with an adjacent surface of about 250 km2 [Dias, 2001]. It is highly dynamic\nin terms of physical and biogeochemical processes and affects the life of more than 300 000 people\nwho live around the lagoon and its channels [Re? et al., 1991]. The human concentration around the\nlagoon bring up several environmental and pollution problems. Ria de Aveiro has a very complex\nand irregular geometry characterized by a high number of narrow and shallow channels and the\n\nexistence of significant intertidal areas. The lagoon has four main channels: Mira and I?lhavo channels\nin its southern region, S. Jacinto channel in its northern region and the Espinheiro channel in the\ncentral area of the lagoon. The lagoon is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a single inlet and the\nfreshwater contributions are from five rivers: Vouga, Antua?, Caster, Gonde and Boco River. The\nmajor contributor is Vouga River which discharges more than 66% of the incoming freshwater [Dias,\n2001] and is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the Espinheiro Channel. Due to their individual\ncharacteristics, these main channels behave like independent estuaries connected to a common inlet.\nThe human intervention is fundamental in the lagoon\u2019s evolution, due to frequent works near its inlet\nwhich are necessary due to the intense ship traffic and harbour activities.\n\nIn a coastal system like Ria de Aveiro, the salinity and water temperature dynamics are influ-\nenced, in a very complex interaction, by tides, freshwater coming from terrestrial drainage and by\nexchange processes with the adjacent atmosphere. The water movements and the turbulent mixing\ndue to the action of the different driving forces constitute an interesting and challenging issue in the\nhydrodynamic domain. The study of these problems is very important as a basis for the full biogeo-\nchemical characterization of the ecosystem as well as for the comprehension of how such complex\nsystems really work.\n\nIn the physical oceanography area, estuarine studies are usually performed using two different\nbut interconnected approaches: field measurements and modelling work (physical and numerical\n\nmodels).\nThe main goal of this work is the study of heat and salt transport processes along the Espinheiro\n\nChannel, and through its boundaries with the Atlantic Ocean and the Vouga River. This is a very\ndynamic channel and was chosen because it connects the major freshwater contributor of Ria de\nAveiro (Vouga River) and the Atlantic Ocean. The thermohaline dynamics within the channel is\nexamined evaluating how tides and river inflow interact within this natural system. In order to achieve\nthis purpose two complementary and interconnected approaches are proposed: in situ measurements\nof water temperature, salinity, current velocity, river flow and water flux between the lagoon and\n\n\n\n1.1 Motivation 3\n\n40\u00ba50'\n\n40\u00ba 45'\n\n40'\n\n35'\n\n8\u00ba44' 40'\n\nA\ntl\n\nan\nti\n\nc \nO\n\nce\nan\n\nM\nir\n\na \nC\n\nha\nnn\n\nel\n\u00cdlhavo C\n\nhannel\n\nS.\n J\n\nac\nin\n\nto\n C\n\nha\nnn\n\nel\nEspinheiro\nChannel\n\nAveiro\n\nVouga\nRiver\n\nAn\ntu\n\n\u00e3 R\niv\n\ner\n\nBoco\nRiver\n\nMira\n\nSp\nai\n\nn\n\nP\nor\n\ntu\nga\n\nl\n\nRia de\nAveiro\n\nCaster River\n\nGonde\nRiver\n\nL\nat\n\nit\nud\n\ne\n\nLongitude\n\nFigure 1.1: The Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The study area is marked (white thick line).\n\nthe ocean and numerical results obtained through the use of a finite volume model that combines\nhydrodynamic and transport modules: Mohid - Water Modelling System.\n\nThe study region brought to our attention here is located in the central area of the Ria de Aveiro\nlagoon, and extends itself from the the mouth of the lagoon to the Vouga River mouth, including\nthe Espinheiro Channel itself. For simplicity, and throughout this dissertation, the study area will be\nnamed as Espinheiro channel.\n\nSynoptic campaigns were performed along the Espinheiro channel in order to examine horizontal\nand vertical thermohaline structures and their dependence on tidal regime and freshwater inflow. For\nthat purpose, ten cross-section were defined along the channel in which salinity and water temperature\n\nmeasurements were taken. These synoptic surveys were performed at maximum spring and neap tide\n- twice a month - during a full year. Concurrent to this campaigns, the Vouga River inflow was\nmeasured. Fixed station surveys of thermohaline and water velocity were also performed in order\nto characterize the main mechanisms driving the tidally-averaged salt transport at two different and\ncritical locations: the channel\u2019s mouth and head.\n\nThe irregular geometry of the Ria de Aveiro (and its main channels) and the complexity of the\n\n\n\n4 Introduction\n\nsystem equations which describe the water mass characteristics within the lagoon, require the use\nof an accurate numerical model which, conjugated with the field measurements, provide detailed\ninformation about spatial and temporal variations of the system.\n\nIn order to study mixing processes within Espinheiro Channel, it was used Mohid [Martins et al.,\n2001], a three-dimensional baroclinic model with the ability to simulate flooding and drying of tidal\nflats. The model was first implemented for the entire lagoon, in a two-dimensional mode (depth-\nintegrated), with a closer look to the central area (where Espinheiro Channel is located), in order to\nstudy the dependence of the thermohaline horizontal structure with the tidal regime and freshwater\ninflow. Although these kind of applications reveal some of the main features of the horizontal ther-\nmohaline structure, mixing processes within the lagoon are driven not only by freshwater discharge\nand the barotropic component of the pressure gradient due to tides, but also by its baroclinic com-\nponent due to salinity gradients (horizontal and vertical). Due to the shallowness of the lagoon and\nthe existence of large intertidal areas, it is virtually impossible to study the whole system in a three-\n\ndimensional mode. In order to overleap this difficulty, a high resolution three-dimensional application\nfor the Espinheiro Channel was developed.\n\nThe narrow and complex morphology of the channel with its several contributors make this area\na challenging place to develop, for the first time, a predictive three-dimensional model. The water\nexchange between Espinheiro and the adjacent areas is critical, rendering necessary the simulation\nof the inflow/outflow between the channel and the rest of the lagoon. In order to simulate water\nexchange between the channel and the rest of the lagoon, the three-dimensional model uses as land-\nward boundary conditions water flow values computed using the two-dimensional model. This is a\ncomplex kind of nesting, in which a more general model provides boundary conditions for a more\nspecific model.\n\n1.2 Literature survey\n\nAs previously referred, the importance of estuarine environments (classic shape estuaries, tidal chan-\nnels or coastal lagoons) is recognized all around the world. These ecosystems are subject to an\nenormous human and natural stress. In order to perform estuarine studies from the physical point\nof view, research programs in which are developed numerical models and in which the numerical\nresults are conjugated with field measurements are being implemented world wide. The estuarine\n\ndynamics, regarding water temperature and salinity, has been studied since, at least, 1960, exploring\ntopics like the hydrographic characterization and the salt fluxes calculation. The main driving forces\nof the estuarine circulation are sea level changes at the mouth, the river inflow near the head of these\nsystems and meteorological conditions of the adjacent atmosphere. These driving forces interacting\nwith the estuarine topography determine the thermohaline distribution.\n\nDuring the last decades, thermohaline dynamics has been studied in many estuarine systems\nworld wide. Among others, the pioneer studies by Cameron and Pritchard [1963], Hansen and Rat-\ntray [1966] and Pritchard [1967] have provided definitions and classification modes (qualitative and\n\n\n\n1.2 Literature survey 5\n\nquantitative) of the estuarine areas using criteria like stratification, characteristics of the salinity dis-\ntributions and circulation, and salinity structure. Topics like salinity intrusion were studied under the\nscope of estuarine circulation and salt transport research works.\n\nThe classical main core of these studies is the analytic solution by Hansen and Rattray [1965] and\nthe closely related diagnostic scheme of Hansen and Rattray [1966] where estuaries are described\nthrough a steady-state balance of three salt fluxes: down-estuary advection of salt by the mean flow,\nup estuary salt return by the vertical gravitational circulation and up-estuary diffusive flux, repre-\nsenting all other exchange, which closes the balance. MacCready [1999] generalized this theory in\norder to include time dependence. Studies of the estuarine response to changes in the river flow input\nin terms of both their time scale [Kranenburg, 1986; MacCready, 1999] and magnitude [Officer and\nKester, 1991; Gibson and Najjar, 2000; Monismith et al., 2002] occupy much of the literature.\n\nEstuarine salt dynamics studies are ecologically significant at regional levels, since salt is a natu-\nral tracer, and can be used to provide insight about other conservative substances behaviour. Several\n\nauthors examined the net salt fluxes and computed the salt balance using different approaches. Fis-\ncher [1972] and Dyer [1974] began to described a number of mechanisms and methods by which\nthe salt balance and dispersion are analyzed for partially and stratified estuaries. The main driving\nforces of the non-tidal circulation and the calculation of the advective and dispersive contributions\nto the salt transport were examined by Hunkins [1981]; Miranda and Castro Filho [1996]; Be?rgamo\n[2000] in their studies for the Hudson and Canane?ia Sea estuaries. The cross-sectional salt balance\nin a tropical estuary was studied by Dyer et al. [1992] illustrating the dynamic coupling between\nthe transverse and vertical contributions on a tidal and tidally averaged basis. More recently, several\nobservational studies have provided a description of the salt transport and exchange processes: Simp-\nson et al. [2001] and Banas et al. [2004] in their studies in the Conwy Estuary (UK) and Willapa Bay\n(USA) explore the hydrographic features of two macrotidal highly energetic estuaries and compute\nthe salt balance in those systems due to tidal motion and river flow. Miranda et al. [2005] exam-\nined the interaction of river discharge and tidal modulation in a tropical estuary using observations\nof thermohaline properties and currents revealing salt transport features both during neap and spring\ntidal cycles. Bowen and Geyer [2003] examined the mechanisms and variability of salt transport at\na relatively uniform section of the Hudson estuary using a 70-day moored time series. MacCready\nand Geyer [2001]; MacCready et al. [2002] explored the approach proposed by Dronkers and van de\nKreeke [1986], in which the concept of looking at the salt flux through a vertical cross section which\n\nmoves up and down the estuary with the tidal velocity was developed, and took a step forward, by\nusing an actual isohaline as the surface through which salt and fluxes are computed, including long\ntime scales and the case in which isohalines are ejected from the ocean\u2019s end.\n\nIn the north of the Iberian Peninsula, the Galician Rias have been exhaustively studied in terms\nof their hydrologic features. These studies turn important because the Rias Baixas (local name of\nthe Galician Rias) support a very important national industry: the mussel industry. This aquaculture\nindustry can be affected by the hydrographic characteristics of the local waters rendering important\nthis kind of studies. In the following it will be presented some recent studies in this area. Thus, the\n\n\n\n6 Introduction\n\nsalinity and water temperature behavior have been studied in order to characterize its intra and inter-\nannual evolution in the boundary between the Rias and the adjacent ocean [Alvarez et al., 2005],\nand Prego et al. [2001] provided an assessment of the physical-hydrodynamical characteristics of\nthe Pontevedra Ria, studying its hydrography during Spring upwelling events; the hydrography of\nthe Ria of Pontevedra has also been investigated under Winter-upwelling conditions [A?lvarez et al.,\n2003], and the effect of the Rio Minho\u2019s intrusion in the hydrographic behaviour of the Rias Baixas\nwas assessed using thermohaline observations [Alvarez et al., 2006]; deCastro et al. [2004] studied\nthe along estuary negative circulation in the Ria of Pontevedra, revealing a two-layered circulation\npattern generated by the existence of two different water masses at intermediate depths.\n\nDuring the last years, an enormous effort was placed in the implementation of numerical models\nthat resolve the main physical processes occurring in estuarine systems. The main scope of these\nstudies has been the characterization of the estuarine salinity structure (in the literature, there are\nfew examples of the estuarine water temperature structure characterization). As Warner et al. [2005]\n\ndescribe in their study of the Hudson estuary: \u201dThe estuarine salinity structure is a result of a com-\nplex interplay between the buoyancy flux from the river inflow, advection by tides and the estuarine\ncirculation, and mixing\u201d. Thus, model predictions of the time-dependent salinity field depend on\nthe model representation of tidal and subtidal motions as well as the turbulence parameterizations\nfor mixing of momentum and salt. This complex interaction makes the implementation of estuarine\nnumerical models particularly challenging.\n\nRecently, several estuarine modelling studies have considered one-dimensional (vertical) repre-\nsentations of the velocity and salinity fields [Nunes Vaz et al., 1989; Simpson et al., 1990, 1991; Simp-\nson and Sharples, 1991; Nunes Vaz and Simpson, 1994; Monismith and Fong, 1996; Zhou, 1998]\nwith the objectives of evaluating turbulence closure models and assessing the interaction between\ntidal shear, mixing and stratification. However, the comparison between one-dimensional model re-\nsults and observations often presents some discrepancies that may be due to unresolved variations of\nthe salinity gradient [Simpson and Sharples, 1991], or inadequacy of the turbulence closure [Simpson\nand Sharples, 1991; Nunes Vaz and Simpson, 1994]. One common failure in these one-dimensional\nmodels with second-order closure [Mellor and Yamada, 1982] is the so called \u201drunaway stratifica-\ntion\u201d in which stratification tends to increase when the tidal amplitude drops below some threshold\nvalue.\n\nThe classic estuarine theory found in Hansen and Rattray [1965] demonstrate that the longitudinal\n\nsalinity gradient (?s/?x) is not an independent variable, but it is part of the solution of the momentum\nand salinity conservation equations for a specified freshwater flow. Theoretical studies by MacCready\n[1999] and Kranenburg [1986] reveal the large temporal variability of ?s/?x indicating its variation\nwith tidal amplitude. These studies suggest that the salinity gradient should be included as a de-\npendent variable, limiting this way the prognostic abilities of one-dimensional (vertically resolving)\nmodels.\n\nOne way to overcome the problem of specifying the salinity gradients is the use of three-\ndimensional models (where the salinity gradient is a dependent variable). Lately, there has been\n\n\n\n1.2 Literature survey 7\n\nmultiple applications in which the variability of stratification, tidal and mean shear, and longitudinal\nsalinity gradient have been evaluated. All these model applications used measured data in order to\nvalidate their results. In the following paragraphs a few recent three-dimensional model applications\nwill be referred. Cugier and Le Hir [2002] developed a 3D hydrodynamical model to study the Seine\nriver plume. Prandle [2004] presents a model which studies the salinity intrusion in partially strat-\nified estuaries, extending earlier studies which relate tidally averaged linearized theories relating to\nthe vertical structure of salinity and velocities, to include tidal straining and associated convective\noverturning. The applicability of the model was evaluated by the simulation of measurements by\nRippeth et al. [2001]. Warner et al. [2005] have used ROMS [Haidvogel et al., 2000] in order to\nevaluate the estuarine dynamics of the Hudson estuary, providing a skill assessment of the model by\ncomparison of model results and observed data. The dynamics of Chesapeake Bay has been studied\nusing ROMS [Li et al., 2005]. In this last work, a new three-dimensional model for the bay was\ndeveloped. Model results and observations were compared in order to validate the model, and several\n\ntests using different turbulence closure models were carried out in order to evaluate the model sensi-\ntivity to the mixing parameterizations. The same model was used by Zhong and Li [2006] to compute\ntidal energy fluxes and dissipation in Chesapeake bay. The numerical model GETM [Burchard and\nBolding, 2002; Burchard et al., 2004] was used to analyze transport pathways and residence time\nin Willapa bay, Washington [Banas and Hickey, 2005], examining the mechanisms and timescales\nof exchange between the estuary and the near-ocean. This model has previously been used to model\ntidal dynamics in the East Frisian Wadden Sea [Stanev et al., 2003], the baroclinic dynamics estuarine\nturbidity maximum in the Elbe estuary [Burchard et al., 2004], and seasonal hydrographic patterns in\nthe North Sea [Stips et al., 2004]. In Tomales Bay (California), the DELFT3D-Flow has been used\nto understand the Summer circulation under differing conditions where cold water density currents\nintrusion events were qualitatively simulated and the sensitivity of the density driven circulation to\ndifferent parameters and processes were assessed [Harcourt-Baldwin and Diedericks, 2006].\n\nRegarding Ria de Aveiro, there are not many studies exploiting the hydrography or the physical\ncharacteristics of the lagoon. In fact, during the last 20/30 years, the lagoon has been studied mainly\nfrom a biological and chemical point of view. These studies gave origin to several publications like\nAlmeida et al. [2001]; Cunha et al. [2001] (bacterioplancton) or Morgado et al. [2003] (zooplank-\nton). Other authors like Moreira et al. [1993]; Queiroga et al. [1994]; Cunha [1999] performed some\nlocalized measurements of water temperature, salinity and currents as backup to their studies. More\n\nrecently, Saraiva [2005] and Trancoso et al. [2005] used a three-dimensional numerical model to\nstudy macroalgae dynamics within the lagoon, revealing its importance in the primary production.\nLopes et al. [2005] present a characterization of the lagoon\u2019s water quality using a physical, chemical\nand biological data set and the implementation of a numerical model for the water quality within the\nlagoon. Coelho et al. [26] and Ramalhosa et al. [2006] in their recent papers have studied mercury\nbioaccumulation and mercury cycle within the Ria de Aveiro. Rocha et al. [2005] have studied the\nsediments within the lagoon in terms of their chemical and mineralogical characterization, and Bobos\nand Rocha [2006] have studied sediment dispersion in several locations within the lagoon.\n\n\n\n8 Introduction\n\nFrom the physical point of view, several studies were performed in order to investigate topics\nsuch as the tidal propagation in the lagoon [Dias et al., 2000], the lagrangian transport of particles\n[Dias et al., 2001] and sediment transport [Abrantes et al., 2005; Dias et al., 2003; Lopes et al.,\n2001, 2006]. Dias [2001] present a complete two-dimensional hydrodynamic study of the lagoon,\nrevealing its main features; Dias and Lopes [2006] present the implementation and assessment of a\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport model for the entire area of the lagoon, and the sea\nlevel variability inside the lagoon was studied by Arau?jo [2005] using field data and modelling work.\nAbrantes [2005] has used fine fractions as tracer on sediment dynamics within the lagoon. Dias and\nFernandes [2006] examined the propagation of tidal and subtidal oscillation within the lagoon and\nDias et al. [1999] reveal the lagoon\u2019s Summer hydrologic characteristics. More recently, Vaz et al.\n[2005a] used numerical modelling and field measurements to study the salinity and water temperature\ndistributions, in the central area of the lagoon, using extreme tidal and river flow forcing conditions,\nand the fluvial estuary of the Vouga River was characterized by means of the salinity, temperature and\n\ncurrent structure [Vaz et al., 2005b]. The water exchange between the lagoon and the near ocean was\nstudied using the motionally induced voltage (MIV) method [Nolasco et al., 2006], showing that it is\npossible to indirectly measure the water transport, by tidal and residual flows, through the lagoon\u2019s\ninlet using differences of electrical potential measurements.\n\n1.3 Structure of this work\n\nThe aim of this dissertation is the study of salinity and water temperature dynamics in the Espinheiro\nchannel, one of the four main branches of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon. A detailed description of the\nchannel is given in sections like Section 2.2 and 3.2. This channel connects the major source of fresh-\nwater of the lagoon - Vouga river - [Dias et al., 1999] and the Atlantic Ocean, being ideal to perform\nthese studies. As previously referred, knowing the salinity and water temperature behavior provide\ninsight not only for a better comprehension of the study area\u2019s dynamics but also for subsequent\nbiogeochemical studies. In order to study the thermohaline dynamics, this work uses results from\nfield measurements of salinity, water temperature and current velocity performed in the Espinheiro\nchannel and results provided by a numerical model.\n\nThis dissertation contains several articles originally prepared for independent publication in in-\nternational journals together with non-published or non-submitted texts. Chapter 1 describes the\n\nmotivation, structure of the work and presents a general literature survey. Chapter 2 describes the\nhydrographic characterization of the Espinheiro channel based on the field measurements, consisting\nin the submitted paper \u201dHydrographic characterization of an estuarine tidal channel\u201d by N. Vaz and\nJ. M. Dias (2006). Chapter 3 is the submitted paper by N. Vaz and J. M. Dias (2006), \u201dSalt fluxes in\na complex river mouth system of POrtugal\u201d. In Chapter 4 are described the equations resolved by the\nmodel as well as the parameterizations used. Chapter 5 describes the two-dimensional application of\nthe hydrodynamic model to the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, resulting in the submitted paper: \u201dApplication\nof the MohidD-2D model to a mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\u201d by N. Vaz, J. M. Dias, P. C. Leita?o\n\n\n\n1.4 Papers 9\n\nand R. Nolasco. Chapter 7 consists on the published paper by Vaz et al. (2005), \u201dHorizontal patterns\nof water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel: Ria de Aveiro\u201d. The next chapter is\na non-submitted text describing the calibration and validation of the salt and heat transport models\nand, Chapter 8 is a paper under preparation which presents the three-dimensional application of the\nnumerical model to the Espinheiro channel. The last chapter is reserved for general conclusions and\nfuture work.\n\nDue to these different origins, there are some repetitions among the introductions, study area\nand numerical model description along the chapters of this dissertation. These repetitions have been\nretained because the papers are considered sequential, providing a synthesis of the physical observa-\ntions and modelling work on Ria de Aveiro and Espinheiro Channel.\n\n1.4 Papers\n\n\u2022 Chapter 2 is the submitted paper: Nuno Vaz, Joa?o Miguel Dias (2006). \u201dHydrographic charac-\nterization of an estuarine tidal channel\u201d.

Salinity and water tem-\n\nperature vertical profiles were measured twice a month from September 2003 to September 2004 at\n\nten stations along the channel. Furthermore, in order to characterize the upper fluvial region of the\n\nchannel in terms of these variables, thermohaline properties and current speed were also measured\n\nduring two tidal cycles at an anchor station near the channel\u2019s head. The salinity distribution along\n\nthe channel has been found to be closely related to the incoming river flow and tidal propagation.\n\nThe water temperature distribution is related to the freshwater temperature seasonal variations and,\n\ndue to the shallowness of the study area, is also related to the meteorological conditions. Forma-\n\ntion of strong salinity gradients (commonly related to estuarine fronts) have been found in a region\n\nbetween 7 and 8 km from the lagoon\u2019s mouth. These gradients migrate within a region of about 1\n\nkm depending on the tidal regime: neaps or springs and its formation is related to changes in the\n\nchannel\u2019s morphology (depth and width).\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nAccording to Barnes [1980] coastal lagoons are saline water bodies separated or partially-isolated\nfrom the sea. They may be enclosed by several barrier islands, like Ria Formosa (in southern Por-\ntugal), as well as sand spits, or linked to the sea by one or more channels, which are small relative\nto the lagoon [Barnes, 1980], like Ria de Aveiro (in northern Portugal). The main driving forces of\ncirculation in a large number of coastal lagoons and estuaries are river flow at the head of the estuary\nand sea level changes at its mouth. These driving forces determine the thermohaline distribution, as\nwell as the distribution of any other tracer. In fact, MacCready [1999] have shown that the estuarine\nbehavior adjusts dynamically to changes in river flow and tidal mixing. In coastal lagoons, forcing\n\n\n\n12 Hydrographic characterization of an estuarine tidal channel\n\ndue to the precipitation to evaporation balance, wind stress and surface heat balance are, according\nto Kjerfve [1994], also important. Newton and Mudge [2003] found these features in the study of the\nwater temperature and salinity regimes in Ria Formosa (Southern Portugal).\n\nThis paper examines the hydrographic characteristics of an estuarine tidal channel, the Espinheiro\nChannel, evaluating the importance of the main forcing mechanisms: incoming river flow and tides.\n\nThe Espinheiro Channel is one of the four main branches of Ria de Aveiro, a mesotidal and\nshallow coastal lagoon located in the northwest coast of Portugal. This channel connects the major\nsource of freshwater of the lagoon - Vouga River - to the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 2.1), being ideal to\nperform studies such as the one proposed here. This lagoon is the most dynamic in terms of physical\nand biogeochemical processes in Portugal. It is a very important system in the region where it is\nsituated due to the intense human activity in its waters and along its margins. In spite its importance,\nthe lagoon and particularly this channel are not well known, in terms of its hydrographic and physical\nprocesses. In fact, in the last 20/30 years the lagoon was studied mainly from a biologic, chemical and\n\ngeological point of view, conducting to several publications like Cunha et al. [2001]; Almeida et al.\n[2001] (bacterioplancton), Morgado et al. [2003] (zooplankton), Abrantes et al. [2005] (suspended\nsediments). Other authors like Moreira et al. [1993]; Queiroga et al. [1994]; Cunha [1999] performed\nsome localized measurements of water temperature, salinity and currents. There are not many studies\nor publications regarding the hydrography or the physical processes of the lagoon. However, Dias\net al. [1999] in a prior hydrographic study reveal some of the main features of Ria de Aveiro. Records\nof water level, hereinafter SSE (sea surface elevation), current velocity and thermohaline properties\nwere performed at several stations in the lagoon during the Summer seasons of 1996 and 1997. They\nhave determined the type of tide at the mouth of the lagoon (semi-diurnal) and have observed that\nthe astronomical tide is the main forcing driving water circulation within the lagoon. They also have\n\nE\nsp\n\nin\nh\ne\nir\no\n\nC\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\nS\n. \nJ\na\nc\nin\n\nto\n C\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\n8\u00ba45'\n\n38'\n\n41'\n\n40'\n\n37'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4 5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n0 200\n\nkm\n\nSpain\n\nFigure 2.1: Map of the study area with the location of the sampling stations along the Espinheiro\nchannel.\n\n\n\n2.2 Study area 13\n\nobserved that the tidal wave propagation in the lagoon has the characteristics of a damped progressive\nwave. A more recent study [Vaz et al., 2005a], combining field measurements and modelling results,\nrevealed the importance of the river flow in the establishment of the thermohaline horizontal patterns\nin the central area of the lagoon. Ria de Aveiro has been also studied through the use of numerical\nmodels. In fact, several studies were performed to investigate topics such as the tidal propagation in\nthe lagoon [Dias et al., 2000], the lagrangian transport of particles [Dias et al., 2001] and sediment\ntransport [Lopes et al., 2001; Dias et al., 2003].\n\nThe Ria de Aveiro constitutes a unique ecosystem in Europe. According to Barnes [1980], 5.3%\nof the Europe\u2019s coastline falls into the category of coastal lagoons. Most of these environments are\nlocated in the microtidal Mediterranean basin. Atlantic mesotidal lagoons include some lagoons in\nsouth-west France and some of western Iberian Peninsula. Lagoons fall into another type of wetland\nhabitats like estuarine lagoons (Ria de Aveiro) or yet another which constitutes a coastal shape cor-\nrespondent to a re-entrance, resultant from the submersion by the sea of the terminal zone of a fluvial\n\nnetwork (like the Galician Rias) [Granja, 1996].\nThis study intends to be a step forward in the understanding of a coastal system that has received\n\nalmost no oceanographic attention beyond the studies cited before. In the following, it will be in-\nvestigated how the seawater and the freshwater interact within Espinheiro channel, evaluating the\nbehavior of the salt and water temperature three-dimensional structure in terms of the main forcing\nfactors: incoming river flow and astronomical tide. Studies about the estuarine response to changes in\nriver flow in terms of the time scale [Kranenburg, 1986; MacCready, 1999] or magnitude [Monismith\net al., 2002] are common in the literature. In fact, the study of the salt behavior within estuaries is an\nactual and extremely important issue because it provides an enormous insight to predict the behavior\nof other soluble tracers. Simpson et al. [2001] and Banas et al. [2004], in their studies, explore the\nhydrographic features of two macrotidal highly energetic estuaries and compute the salt balance in\nthose systems due to tidal motion and river flow. This paper describes one year observations in Es-\npinheiro channel in terms of the thermohaline properties. In Section 2 a description of the study area\nis presented. In Section 3 it is presented the methodology as well as the materials used during the\nfield campaigns. The next sections contain the results and the conclusions.\n\n2.2 Study area\n\nA map of the Ria de Aveiro location and Espinheiro channel is shown in Figure 2.1. Espinheiro\nchannel is located in the very complex central area of Ria de Aveiro, a mesotidal and shallow (mean\ndepth of about 1 m relative to the local datum) coastal lagoon situated in the northwest Atlantic coast\nof the Iberian Peninsula, in Portugal. For simplicity, the study area from the mouth of the lagoon\n(near section 1) until near section 10 will be hereinafter referred as Espinheiro channel. However, it\nincludes two distinct regions: the first extending from the mouth of the lagoon to near station 5 (see\nFigure 1 for reference) and the second is the Espinheiro channel itself, extending from section 5 to\nnear section 10. The study area is approximately 11 km long, has an averaged width of about 200 m\n\n\n\n14 Hydrographic characterization of an estuarine tidal channel\n\nand a mean depth, along its longitudinal axis, of about 10 m. The tides are mixed semi-diurnal, being\nM2 the most important constituent, representing about 90% of the tidal energy [Dias et al., 1999].\n\nThe estimated tidal prism for the lagoon at extreme spring and extreme neap is according to Dias\n[2001] 136.7\u00d7106 and 34.9\u00d7106 m3, respectively. Near section 5 is about 40\u00d7106 at extreme spring\nand 15\u00d7106 m3 at extreme neap tide [Dias, 2001]. The total estimated freshwater input for the lagoon\nis very small (about 1.8\u00d7106 m3 during a complete tidal cycle) [Moreira et al., 1993] when compared\nwith the tidal prism both at the mouth or at the beginning of Espinheiro channel. In spite of the small\ncontribution of the discharging rivers in terms of water input, when compared to the tidal prism, they\nmay have a long-term influence in the residual transport [Dias et al., 2003]. Previous studies by Dias\net al. [2000] and Dias [2001] revealed that the tide is strongly distorted as it progresses upstream from\nthe mouth toward the end of the channels of the lagoon, due to changes in channel\u2019s geometry and\nbathymetry. The general characteristics of the tidal wave are those of a damped progressive wave.\nNevertheless, in shallow areas the tidal wave assumes the main characteristics of a standing wave.\n\nFrom a dynamical point of view, Espinheiro channel may be considered the most important area\nof the Ria de Aveiro, because the strongest currents are observed here, reaching values higher than\n2 ms?1. The lagoon\u2019s other channels are mainly shallow and tidal flat areas, contributing to a strong\ndumping of currents.\n\n2.3 Materials and Methods\n\n2.3.1 Sampling strategy\n\nIn order to obtain a good spatial coverage, producing a reliable synoptic view, in situ vertical profiles\nof water temperature and salinity were sampled along ten cross-sections (Figure 2.1) separated by\n\n1000 m (see Table 2.1 for reference). The first cross-section is located near the mouth of the lagoon\nand the last one is located near the channel\u2019s head, close to the mouth of the Vouga River. In order to\nperform the measurements, it was used a SAIV A/S mini STD model SD204. Water pressure, water\ntemperature and salinity were measured using a time step of 1 s. This instrument measures water\ntemperature using a Thermistor in a range from -2 to 40?C with an accuracy of +/- 0.01?C. The water\npressure is measured using a Piezoresistive sensor with an accuracy of +/- 0.02% of the depth (500\nm) and for the conductivity the instrument uses a Inductive cell in a range of 0 to 70 mS/cm with an\naccuracy of +/- 0.02 mS/cm. The salinity is calculated from the conductivity, water temperature and\nwater pressure in a range from 0 to 40 ppt with an accuracy of 0.02 ppt.\n\nThe measurements were performed twice a month at spring tide (maximum of tidal amplitude)\nand at the following neap (minimum of tidal amplitude). Each survey began at station 1 approxi-\nmately 1h 40 min after the low tide hour predicted for the mouth of the lagoon, during the flood\nstream. In each cross-section, the profiles of the thermohaline variables were sampled at three points:\nnear the margins of the channel and in its axis. The survey period lasted from September 2003 (be-\n\n\n\n2.3 Materials and Methods 15\n\nTable 2.1: Depth and location of the 10 stations located along longitudinal axis of the study area\nStation Depth [m] Latitude [N] Longitude [W]\n\n1 27.5 40?38.66\u2019 8?44.90\u2019\n2 21.5 40?38.93\u2019 8?44.15\u2019\n3 21.6 40?39.45\u2019 8?43.39\u2019\n4 14.5 40?39.62\u2019 8?42.79\u2019\n5 9.6 40?39.66\u2019 8?41.96\u2019\n6 14.6 40?40.20\u2019 8?41.23\u2019\n7 14.8 40?40.60\u2019 8?40.63\u2019\n8 5.7 40?40.95\u2019 8?39.81\u2019\n9 5.8 40?41.17\u2019 8?39.13\u2019\n\n10 7.5 40?41.57\u2019 8?38.60\u2019\n\nginning of Autumn) until September 2004 (end of Summer) covering extreme tidal conditions (twice\na month) during one full year.\n\nData were collected in order to characterize the along and cross-channel distribution of water\ntemperature and salinity during extreme tidal events. The spatial distribution of the cross-sections\ndefined along the channel allow the coverage of at least three distinct regions: a marine or lower\narea of the channel, in free connection with the open sea; a middle area, subject to strong salt and\nfreshwater mixing; and the upper fluvial area of the channel, characterized by freshwater but subject\nto daily tidal action.\n\nLongitudinal (horizontal and vertical) and cross-sectional fields of water temperature and salin-\nity were determined by spatial interpolation of the measured data using an ordinary Point-Krigging\nmethod [Cressie, 1993].\n\nAt the lagoon\u2019s mouth a moored station was installed. Water temperature, salinity and SSE were\n\nsampled every hour during 3 months, from September 23 of 2003 to January 7 of 2004 , in order to\ncharacterize the water mass characteristics at the mouth of the lagoon. Ideally, this station should\nbe located in the middle of the channel in order to better characterize the tidal flow. However, due\nto the strong currents existing here and the intense boat traffic, the station was installed in a existent\ntidal gauge station, located in the south channel margin. The measurements were performed using\nthe SAIV A/S mini STD model SD204 previously referred.\n\nAn anchor station, near cross-section 9, was selected for an intensive study of tidal cycles (25 h).\nThe location of this station was chosen because it is an important and sensible area of fisheries and\nrecreational waters, and because a paper industry is located a few km upstream. It is also ecological\nimportant due to the existence of rice (and other) cultures in the surrounding low lands of Baixo-\nVouga. These cultures are affected by the saline intrusion and the knowledge of the behavior of\nthe thermohaline variables response to tides and river flow in this area is commercially important,\nespecially in dry years when the incoming freshwater is very low. Thus, in order to evaluate how\ncurrent speed, salinity and water temperature stratification behaves under the influence of a freshwater\nsource in this tidal domain, lunar-hourly vertical profiles of the thermohaline properties and current\nspeed were measured during two consecutive tidal cycles (25 hours) for four sampling periods (one\nat each year season): January 15th, June 16th, August 27th and December 3rd corresponding to river\n\n\n\n16 Hydrographic characterization of an estuarine tidal channel\n\nrunoff of 58 m3s?1, 11.2 m3s?1, 3 m3s?1 and 5 m3s?1, respectively. The instrumentation used was the\nSAIV A/S mini STD model SD204 previously referred and a Valeport current meter model 105. This\ncurrent meter has a High Impact Styrene Impeller to measure the current speed in a range of 0.1 to\n5 ms?1 with an accuracy of \u00b12.5% of reading above 0.5 ms?1 and \u00b10.01 ms?1 below 0.5 ms?1. The\ncurrent direction is measured using a flux gate compass with a range from 0-360? with a resolution\nof 0.5?.\n\nIn order to determine the incoming river flow, concurrent with each survey period, measurements\nof current speed were obtained several km upstream from the river mouth, 3 hours after the low\ntide hour predicted for the lagoon\u2019s mouth. This procedure assures that the measurements of current\nspeed were made outside the region of tidal flood influence. The current velocity data were collected\nusing the Valeport current meter model 105 previously referred. In order to compute the flow, the\nriver section was divided in twenty four 2 m segments and the current velocity and the water depth\nmeasured for each segment. The current velocity was sampled at 60% of the water column following\n\na standard procedure. The total river flow was obtained adding all individual segment results.\n\n2.4 Results and discussion\n\n2.4.1 Meteorological conditions and incoming river flow\n\nA 1 year data set of daily values of precipitation, minimum and maximum air temperature and wind\nintensity measured at the meteorological station located at the University of Aveiro is depicted in\nFigure 2.2.\n\nThis data set is from September 2003 until October 2004, covering the field work period.

As expected, the Summer was the driest season with 22 days of rainfall and a daily maximum\nof about 264 mm. The maximum of the wind intensity was found in the beginning of the Spring,\nreaching a daily maximum of 24.6 kmh?1. The mean values of wind intensity remain almost constant\nduring all year with values around 8 kmh?1. The air temperature values ranged from 2 ?C in the\nWinter to 33.5 ?C in the beginning of September 2003. A malfunction in the thermometer did not\nallow the measurement of temperature maximum during all Winter.\n\nThe incoming river flow concurrent with the field surveys is depicted in Figure 2.3. The highest\nvalues was reached during the Autumn of 2003 and at the beginning of the Winter season, with a\nmaximum of 143.16 m3s?1 in the end of January. During the Winter and until late Spring, the river\nflow values are lower than 50 m3s?1 and at the end of Spring and during the Summer the river flow\ndecreases to values lower than 10 m3s?1. The annual mean river flow is 31.5 m3s?1. The minimum\nvalues are reached in the Summer with values ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 m3s?1. The highest river flow\nvalues were reached during the Autumn when the rainfall reached a daily maximum of 330 mm (see\nFigure 2.2). The river flow highest value occurred during January 2004 as a result of the persistent\nrainy conditions during December and January (visible in Figure 2.2). In the following sections, the\nimportance of the river flow will be discussed in terms of the salinity and water temperature seasonal\ncycles and in terms of the spatial distribution of these two variables.\n\n269 301 329 360 22 51 81 111 140 170 200 230 260\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\nR\niv\n\ner\n f\n\nlo\nw\n\n [\nm\n3\ns\n?\n1\n]\n\nJulian day\n\nAutumn Winter Spring Summer\n\nFigure 2.3: Discrete river flow values during the survey period (September 2003 to September 2004).\n\n2.4.2 Water mass characteristics at the mouth of the lagoon\n\nThe water mass characteristics at the mouth of the lagoon are investigated through the analysis of\n3 month hourly time series of SSE, salinity and water temperature obtained at the moored station\nreferred at Section 2.3.

The minimum value of SSE is about 0.2 m and\nthe maximum is 3.2 m, observed at spring tide. Salinity has also a strong semi-diurnal component,\nwith a maximum value typically oceanic -36 psu- and a minimum value of 13.5 psu (in the Autumn\u2019s\nend). These low salinity values are due to an increase of the freshwater inflow into the lagoon and\nalso the dilution of the salt water due to rainfall. The water temperature evolution is not so regular.\n\nThe maximum and minimum values were 20 and 12.1 ?C, respectively. The periodicity of the salinity\nand water temperature time series is forced by the SSE evolution. The higher salinity values and the\nlower water temperature values where observed at high tide, while the lower salinity values and the\nhigher water temperature values were measured at low water.\n\nThe spectral energies computed for the SSE, salinity and water temperature time series are also\ndepicted in Figure 2.4. The SSE spectrum presents a high energy peak at semi-diurnal frequency (2\ncycles per day (cpd)). The energy associated with the diurnal constituent is also significant, revealing\nthe diurnal inequality of the tide. The SSE spectrum also exhibit peaks at the frequencies correspon-\ndent to first harmonics of the semi-diurnal constituents, revealing the importance of the shallow water\nconstituents characteristic of shallow systems like Ria de Aveiro, where there is a significative tidal\nwave deformation due to bottom friction. Salinity and water temperature spectra also exhibit a high\npeak at the same frequency, as well as smaller energy peaks at frequencies correspondent to the first\nharmonics of the semi-diurnal constituents. The energy of the diurnal frequency peak observed in\nthe salinity spectrum is relatively low, revealing that the salinity cycle is mainly induced by the tide.\nIn the case of water temperature spectrum, the energy of the diurnal frequency peak is significant,\nrevealing the importance of the meteorological variables on the heating/cooling cycle of the water.\n\n\n\n2.4 Results and discussion 19\n\nThese results are similar to those obtained by Dias et al. [1999] in a previous work. One more aspect\nshould be addressed: the high energy near the lower frequencies is a typical red noise behavior. This\nfact is due to the persistence of the SSE, salinity and water temperature data used in the spectral\nanalysis.\n\n2.4.3 Spatial surveys\n\nA description of the general hydrography of Espinheiro channel is presented here. This analysis is\nbased on measurements of water temperature and salinity obtained during the field work conducted\nthroughout a year between September 2003 and September 2004. The seasonal cycle of water tem-\nperature and salinity will be referred here and discussed in the next subsection.\n\nIn Figure 2.5 is depicted the vertical structure of salinity and water temperature along the longi-\ntudinal axis of Espinheiro channel. Station 1 is near the mouth of the lagoon and station 10 is near\nthe channel\u2019s head (see Figure 2.1 for reference).\n\nThese figures were obtained through spatial interpolation of salinity and water temperature ver-\ntical profiles, measured along the channel, and represent synoptic snapshots of the channel in terms\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nStation Number\n\n-28\n\n-24\n\n-20\n\n-16\n\n-12\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32\n\nSalinity [psu]\n\n25/11/2003 (Spring)\nTidal Height = 2.8 m\n\n72.74 m s\n3  -1\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nStation Number\n\n-28\n\n-24\n\n-20\n\n-16\n\n-12\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n11.0 11.4 11.8 12.2 12.6 13.0 13.4 13.8 14.2\n\nTemperature [\u00baC]\n\n25/11/2003 (Spring)\nTidal Height = 2.8 m\n\n72.74 m s\n3  -1\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nStation Number\n\n-27\n\n-23\n\n-19\n\n-15\n\n-11\n\n-7\n\n-3\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32\n\nSalinity [psu]\n\n29/01/2004 (Neap)\nTidal Height = 1.3 m\n\n143.16 m s\n3  -1\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nStation Number\n\n-27\n\n-23\n\n-19\n\n-15\n\n-11\n\n-7\n\n-3\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n10.010.310.610.911.211.511.812.112.412.713.0\n\nTemperature [\u00baC]\n\n29/01/2004 (Neap)\nTidal Height = 1.3 m\n\n143.16 m s\n3  -1\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nStation Number\n\n-28\n\n-24\n\n-20\n\n-16\n\n-12\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n1 5 9 13 17 21 25 29 33\n\nSalinity [psu]\n\n19/05/2004 (Spring)\nTidal Height = 2.2 m\n\n35.0 m s\n3  -1\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nStation Number\n\n-28\n\n-24\n\n-20\n\n-16\n\n-12\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n15.6 16.2 16.8 17.4 18.0 18.6 19.2 19.8 20.4 21.0\n\nTemperature [\u00baC]\n\n19/05/2004 (Spring)\nTidal Height = 2.2 m\n\n35.0 m s\n3  -1\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nStation Number\n\n-27\n\n-23\n\n-19\n\n-15\n\n-11\n\n-7\n\n-3\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34\n\nSalinity [psu]\n\n25/07/2004 (Neap)\nTidal Height = 1.6 m\n\n2.0 m s\n3  -1\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nStation Number\n\n-27\n\n-23\n\n-19\n\n-15\n\n-11\n\n-7\n\n-3\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n19.0 20.0 21.0 22.0 23.0 24.0\n\nTemperature [\u00baC]\n\n25/07/2004 (Neap)\nTidal Height = 1.6 m\n\n2.0 m s\n3  -1\n\nFigure 2.5: Vertical distribution of salinity and water temperature along Espinheiro channel.\n\n\n\n20 Hydrographic characterization of an estuarine tidal channel\n\nof the thermohaline properties. Through the analysis of these figures it will be discussed the balance\nbetween the water column stratification/homogenisation evaluating its dependence on the freshwater\ninflow and tidal propagation.\n\nThe four cases represented are typical conditions of salinity and water temperature for each year\nseason. It can be observed that near the channel\u2019s head, the fluvial region, the water temperature\nranges from 10 ?C during the Winter to values of 24/25 ?C during the Summer. The salinity ranges\nfrom fluvial (about 0 psu) to oceanic typical values (between 32 and 35 psu) depending on the fresh-\nwater inflow. In this region the water column is always stratified, except during intense river inflow\n(higher than 100 m3s?1) and neap conditions when the water column is totaly filled with freshwater.\nDuring high river flow periods (72.74 m3s?1) and spring tide periods, the salinity intrusion through\nthe channel\u2019s bed lead to the establishment of stratification. When the river flow is higher than 40\nm3s?1, the entire water column is filled with freshwater during the low tide and vertical stratification\nis established when the high tide is reached, due to the saline intrusion through the bottom connected\n\nto the sea level rise. In the marine region, the stratification is mainly dependent on the occurrence of\nhigh river discharge events (higher than 100 m3s?1). When the river flow is weak, the water column\nis completely filled with oceanic water (homogeneous water column) and when the river flow is high\nthe water column is stratified even during spring tides, presenting oceanic water in the lower layers\nand brackish water near the surface. In this region the difference between surface and bottom val-\nues of salinity and water temperature is never too high. Between these two sectors a transition area\nis evident , with strong horizontal salinity gradients. In this region, the stratification is established\nonly when the river flow is very intense (higher than 100 m3s?1), presenting the maximum observed\nvertical salinity gradient.\n\nDue to the channel\u2019s shallowness, meteorological variables like air temperature and solar radia-\ntion also play a key role in the heating/cooling cycle of the water. When the river flow is lower than\n100 m3s?1 the vertical water temperature difference is perceptible at the side ends of the channel (in\nthe regions of ocean and river influence) but it is almost imperceptible in the inner region of the chan-\nnel. When the river flow is higher than 100 m3s?1, vertical water temperature difference is observed\nfrom the mouth until the channel\u2019s head, with oceanic values along the bottom and fluvial values\nalong the top layers. One more feature should be addressed, the higher salinity values are observed\nduring the Summer season with oceanic values of about 36 psu. The presence of this highly saline\nwater may be related to upwelling events that occurred during this season when the northwest coast\n\nof Portugal in under the influence of northwestern winds.\nWhen the river flow is lower than 100 m3s?1 it is perceptible the existence of strong salinity gra-\n\ndients, commonly related to estuarine fronts (more visible in the salinity results), between stations 7\nand 8. This strong salinity gradient appears in this region due to changes in the channel\u2019s morphology\n(channel\u2019s width and depth) and the proximity of the region of freshwater influence. In fact, in an\nestuarine system only two facts contribute to the decrease of salinity near the head: first, the shoaling\nof the depth decreases the effectiveness of the exchange flow as a means for up-estuary salt flux; and\nsecond, the tidal excursion is decreased due to the tidal energy damping in an estuarine river [Jay and\n\n\n\n2.4 Results and discussion 21\n\nSmith, 1990a,b], or due to the tides being reflected near the estuary\u2019s head [Lavelle et al., 1988]. In\nEspinheiro channel, depending on the type of tide (spring or neap) and the incoming river flow, these\nstrong salinity gradients are visible within a region between station 7 (neap) to station 8 (spring). The\nthermal gradients are less perceptible due to the smaller horizontal gradients between the mouth and\nthe channel\u2019s head.\n\n2.4.4 The seasonal cycle\n\nIn Figure 2.6 are depicted the spatial-temporal variation of salinity and water temperature at three\ndifferent depths: near surface (2.6a, 2.6d), mid-water (2.6b, 2.6e) and near bottom (2.6c, 2.6f). The\nperiod represented covers an entire year from September 2003 to September 2004. The annual salinity\ndistribution is closely related to the type of tide (spring or neap) and with the Vouga River discharge\nvariability, with salinity values increasing progressively towards the mouth of the lagoon. On the\nother hand, due to the channel\u2019s shallowness the water temperature distribution is less dependent on\nthe river discharge and it is closely related to the freshwater temperature and from its dependence on\nthe air temperature pattern (see Figure 2.2).\n\nAt the top layer (Figure 2.6a) when the river flow is weak, in the beginning of the Autumn, the\nsaline intrusion goes further upstream (almost 1 km) during spring tide. As the river flow increases,\nthe freshwater extends its influence downstream towards the lagoon\u2019s mouth. Under low river inflow,\nthe channel can be divided in two distinct regions: a marine region (from station 1 to near station 8)\nand a fluvial region (from station 8 to station 10). This near surface pattern remains the same during\nAutumn and Winter except in two cases: during surveys 6 (December, 5th) and 10 (January, 29th)\nthe river flow is higher than 100 m3s?1 (see Figure 2.3 for reference) and the near surface water is\nbrackish up to the lagoon\u2019s mouth. The freshwater and the oceanic water mixes and near the lagoon\u2019s\n\nmouth the salinity has values between 20 and 25 psu. During the Spring season, when the river flow\npresents values between 30 and 40 m3s?1, it is perceptible an intense horizontal salinity gradient\nwhich migrates back and forth for about 1 km during neap and spring tide surveys, respectively.\nDuring this period, the channel can be divided in three distinct regions: a lower marine region with\nsalinity values between 30 and 35 psu (from stations 1 and 6), an inner brackish region with salinity\nvalues between 20 and 30 psu (between stations 6 and 8) and a upper fluvial region with salinity\nvalues ranging from 0 to 20 psu. During the Summer season, the incoming freshwater is low -less\nthan 5 m3s?1- and the channel is filled with oceanic waters.\n\nThe mid-depth and near bottom salinity distribution presents almost the same pattern (Figures\n2.6b and 2.6c). Near the channel\u2019s head (from station 8 to 10) during high river runoff events, the wa-\nter column is filled with freshwater.

The salinity intrusion problem is a very important issue concerning agricultural exploration\nwhen the river inflow present values lower than 3 m3s?1. From the salinity figures is perceptible that\nhigher salinity values are found in the Spring and Summer seasons. Not only because the river flow\ndecreases but also because more saline waters incoming from the coastal ocean penetrates into the\nchannel. This may be related to the upwelling season in the northwest Atlantic coast of the Iberian\nPeninsula.\n\nThe water temperature distribution is similar at the surface, mid-depth and near the bottom of\nthe channel. As it can be observed, the horizontal gradients, between the mouth and the channel\u2019s\nhead are smooth during all survey year. This feature may be due to the fact that the oceanic water\ntemperature has low annual variability when compared to the seasonal fluvial water temperature\nvariability, which has a higher range. The signal inversion of water temperature gradient between\n\n\n\n2.4 Results and discussion 23\n\nthe coastal and fluvial waters is perceptible in the figures. In fact, starting from the middle of the\nSpring season to middle of the Autumn, warmer fluvial waters enter into the channel. The opposite\noccurs during the colder seasons when warmer waters came into the channel from the sea. From\nAutumn to Winter, the water temperature in the inner part of the channel decreases almost 6 ?C, from\nvalues between 17 and 19 ?C to values between 11 and 13 ?C. This effect is due not only to the water\ntemperature of the ocean and river waters but also due to the decrease of the air temperature, an effect\nvisible in Figure 2.2 where it is perceptible a decrease of the minimum air temperature of about 5\n?C. From the Winter to Spring the water in the inner part of the channel becomes warmer, increasing\nfrom 11-13 ?C to 19/21 ?C at the end of the Spring season. The same effect is, once more, perceptible\nin Figure 2.2 where it is visible an increase of the minimum and maximum air temperatures. In\nthe Summer, the water temperature within the channel increases to values higher than 23 ?C. The\noceanic and fluvial boundaries of the channel have similar water temperature variations. It is difficult\nto divide the channel in different regions when considering water temperature results. However, near\n\nthe fluvial region, the water temperature values are always 1-2 ?C warmer or cooler, depending on\nthe year season, than in the rest of the channel.\n\nThe analysis of Figure 2.6 reveals the existence of strong salinity gradients (commonly related\nto estuarine fronts) along all of the water column, being noticeable the decreasing of the horizontal\ngradients intensity from surface to bottom. These strong gradients are much more perceptible in the\nsalinity patterns. Near the surface, these estuarine gradients occur during the full year, even when\nthe river flow is weak. During the Summer, when the river flow is very low, this strong gradients are\nnot established at the bottom layers. Typically, these gradients exist between stations 7 and 8, but\nduring high river inflow events (surveys 6-10) they migrate downchannel, revealing a strong salinity\nhorizontal gradient. These strong gradients can be considered as areas of sediment retention (sedi-\nment trapping) and their existence may influence the downstream migration of the fluvial sediments\nfrom the Vouga river. Near the surface, during the Winter and Spring seasons, it is verified the effect\nof the spring-neap tidal cycle on the migration of the observed gradients. During neap tides they\nmigrate downstream and during spring tide periods they migrate further upstream due to the higher\ntidal prism.\n\nDuring survey 6 (December\u2019s beginning) and 10 (January\u2019s end), the water temperature patterns\nare similar to those observed for salinity. The main difference is the longer time scale, i.e. the salinity\nresponse to changes in river flow occurs more rapidly. For the water temperature, there is a slower\n\nresponse due to the lower difference between oceanic and fluvial water temperature values.\n\n2.4.5 Tidal cycling\n\nFigures 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 show the temporal evolution of the salinity, water temperature and current\nvelocity during two tidal cycles in the sampling periods of January (a), June (b), August (c) and\nDecember (d) 2004. These four sampling periods characterize the Winter, late Spring, Summer and\nAutumn conditions.\n\n\n\n24 Hydrographic characterization of an estuarine tidal channel\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\n\nTime [ hours ]\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW\na\nte\n\nr \nH\n\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \n[ \nm\n\n ]\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\nSalinity [psu](a)\n\n15/01/2004\n 10:30 AM\n\n16/01/2004\n 11:30 AM\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\n\nTime [ hours ]\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nW\na\nte\n\nr \nh\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \n[ \nm\n\n ]\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n15/06/2004\n 08:30 AM\n\n16/06/2004\n 09:18 AM\n\n(b) Salinity [psu]\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\n\nTime [ hours ]\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW\na\n\nte\nr \n\nh\ne\n\ni\ng\n\nh\nt \n[ \n\nm\n ]\n\n9\n\n13\n\n17\n\n21\n\n25\n\n29\n\n33\n\nSalinity [psu](c)\n\n26/08/2004\n 15:27 AM\n\n27/08/2004\n 16:15 AM\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\n\nTime [ hours ]\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nW\na\nte\n\nr \nh\ne\nig\n\nh\nt \n[ \nm\n\n ]\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n03/12/2004\n 10:01 AM\n\n04/12/2004\n 10:49 AM\n\nSalinity [psu](d)\n\nFigure 2.7: Temporal evolution of salinity, measured at an anchor station located near station 9,\nduring the January (a), June (b), August (c) and December (d) tidal cycle sampling campaigns.\n\nThe river flow is 58, 11.2, 3 and 5 m3s?1 for the sampling periods of January, June, August and\nDecember, respectively, and the tidal range is 1.7, 2.0, 1.4 and 1.2 m, respectively, corresponding to\nneap tide periods.

As previously referred, the M2 constituent has almost 90% of the total\ntidal energy at the lagoon\u2019s mouth, being its effect dominant even near the far end of the channel.\nIn fact, Figures 2.7a, 2.7d and 2.8a and 2.8d show that the salinity and water temperature present\ntypical oceanic values when the high tide reaches this location. In the Spring and Summer sampling\ncampaigns, this periodicity is more visible during the low water hours.\n\nThe January and December results reveal that a stratification/destratification event takes place.\nIt may be observed that the stratification increases during the flood period, reaching its maximum\n\none hour before the high tide. The difference between the high water time at this location and at the\nchannel\u2019s mouth is about 2 hours. Thus, the tidal wave propagated through the 9 km of this channel\n(from the mouth until this point) with a velocity of about 4.5 kmh?1. Stratification decreases during\nebb until the local low water hour. The entire water column is filled with freshwater propagating from\nthe river, which pushes back the brackish water. Salinity and water temperature values are about 0\npsu and 12 ?C, respectively. The June and August results reveal the partially mixed characteristics\nof the upper region of the channel. In fact, the salinity results show some stratification, especially\nduring low water and beginning of the flood period. The water column is mainly filled with the\nsalt water coming from the coastal ocean. The salinity maximums are reached during the Spring\nand Summer campaigns with values higher than 33 psu. This is an expected feature since the late\nSpring and Summer periods are characterized, in the Aveiro region, by northern winds which induces\nupwelling events. In fact, the salinity maximums ranges from 28 (December campaign) to almost 36\npsu (August campaign).\n\nNear the surface, the water temperature decreases during the day in the January, June and Au-\ngust sampling periods, but during the December campaign the water temperature is approximately\nconstant during the first tidal cycle, decreasing during the second one. Nevertheless, the water tem-\n\n\n\n26 Hydrographic characterization of an estuarine tidal channel\n\nperature variation is strongly connected to the variation - decrease - of the air temperature along the\nday. In Figure 2.8 the inversion of the water temperature is perceptible between the beginning of\nthe Winter (warmer oceanic waters) and the end of Spring (warmer fluvial waters) and between the\nSummer and the Winter season. During the Autumn and Winter the water temperature maximums\nare reached during high water near the bottom, and in opposition, in the warmer seasons sampling\ncampaigns the maximums of water temperature are reached during low water at the surface. The wa-\nter temperature minimums ranges from 6.9 (December) and 16.7 ?C (August) and maximums ranges\nfrom 12.4 in December and values higher than 26 in the June sampling campaign. The water tem-\nperature minimums and maximums varies, between the Winter and the Summer, about 9.8 and 14\n?C.\n\nThe vertical lunar hourly profiles of the velocity modulus during all the sampling campaigns\nindicate an asymmetry between flood (~V > 0) and ebb (~V &lt;0) currents. The ebb currents are\nhigher than the flood currents, reaching maximum speeds, during the January survey, around -1.1 and\n\n0.7 ms?1, respectively (Figure 2.9a). The lower current velocities are observed during the August\ncampaign (Figure 2.9c), being the maximums of -0.5 for the ebb and 0.3 for the flood current. The\ntidal ebb velocity is, in general, enhanced by the freshwater runoff. Near the surface and at mid-\nwater, the current velocity is predominately downstream (in the Autumn and Winter periods), with\nthe surface values higher than the mid-water ones. During the June and August sampling campaigns,\nthe current velocities obtained are, in general, lower than the ones observed during the January and\nDecember campaigns with ebb velocities ranging from 0 to -0.72 (June) and 0 to -0.5 ms?1 (August)\nand flood velocities of about 0.3 ms?1. A similar current velocity asymmetry was found by Miranda\net al. [2004] in studying the dynamics of a tropical estuary, the Curimatau? River, northeast Brazil.\n\n2.5 Conclusions\n\nThis one year sampling campaign in the Espinheiro channel has provided the first insight into its\nhydrographic features. The channel\u2019s hydrodynamics is largely dependent on the freshwater inputs\nvariability as well on the tidal wave characteristics.\n\nAt the lagoon\u2019s mouth, the salinity daily variation is strongly connected to the tidal propagation.\nThe spectral analysis of a data set of SSE and salinity show that the most energetic peak is correspon-\ndent to the semidiurnal frequency, being the diurnal frequency peak less relevant. On the other hand,\n\nthe water temperature spectral analysis reveal high energy peaks in both frequencies, semidiurnal and\ndiurnal, demonstrating the importance of the meteorological variables in the modulation of the water\ntemperature in shallow areas like this study area. All the spectra reveal the existence of significa-\ntive energy peaks correspondent to the first harmonics of the semi-diurnal constituents, revealing the\nimportance of the shallow water constituents in a system like Espinheiro channel. The thermohaline\nfeatures found in each one of the cross-sections are closely related to the tidal characteristics found\nat the lagoon\u2019s mouth.\n\nWhen the river flow is low - lower than 10 m3s?1 - the water column until near station 8 is filled\n\n\n\n2.5 Conclusions 27\n\nwith salt water incoming from the coastal waters. When the river flow is higher than 100 m3s?1\n\nvertical stratification is established along all the channel. The incoming freshwater from the river\nextends its influence, and near the surface, the water is brackish, up to the lagoon\u2019s mouth, with\nsalinity values of about 20 psu. When the river flow is between 30 and 50 m3s?1 the channel can be\ndivided into three different regions: a lower marine region where the salinity and water temperature\npresent oceanic values; an intermediate inner brackish region, where the incoming freshwater mixes\nwith the coastal ocean\u2019s water and a upper fluvial region, dominated by the freshwater but still subject\nto semidiurnal tidal action.\n\nDuring the survey period, it was observed the formation of strong salinity gradients, commonly\nrelated to estuarine fronts, in a region between stations 7 and 8. The formation of these strong gra-\ndients is strongly connected to the interaction between the salt and freshwater as well as to changes\nin channel\u2019s morphologic characteristics, like the width and the depth. It was observed that these\ngradients migrate within a region of about 1 km, between station 7 and 8, depending on the type of\n\ntide: neap and spring, respectively. The longitudinal water temperature variation in the study area\nis smoother than the salinity one, showing lower horizontal gradients. Besides the dependence on\nthe water temperature variation at the channel\u2019s boundaries (ocean and river), the water temperature\nwithin the Espinheiro channel is closely related to meteorological forcing, like air temperature, in-\ncoming solar radiation or relative humidity. This feature may be explained by the shallowness of the\nstudy area.\n\nFrom the four tidal cycle survey campaigns changes were observed in the classification of the\nupper fluvial region of the Espinheiro channel. In fact, during the January and December survey\nperiods, that regions reveal salt wedge characteristics, with the establishment of vertical stratification\nduring the flood period. In opposition, these region reveal partially mixed characteristics during the\nJune and August survey periods, when the incoming freshwater is lower.\n\nThe results shown in the previous sections reveal the importance of the major forcing factors that\ninfluences the water temperature and salinity behavior within Espinheiro channel. In fact, the salinity\ndistribution within the channel is closely related to the interaction between the tide and the river flow.\nThe water temperature distribution is related to the tide and the river flow and, due to the small depth\nof the channel, is also influenced by meteorological variables as air temperature.\n\n\n\n28 Hydrographic characterization of an estuarine tidal channel\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nSalt fluxes in a complex river mouth\nsystem of Portugal\n\nMeasurements of velocity and salinity near the mouth and head of the Espinheiro channel (Ria de\n\nAveiro lagoon) are used to assess the balance, under steady conditions, between the seaward salt\n\ntransport induced by river discharge and the landward dispersion induced by various mixing mecha-\n\nnisms. This assessment is made using data sampled during complete tidal cycles. Under the assump-\n\ntion that the estuarine tidal channel is laterally homogeneous and during moderate tidal periods\n\n(except for one survey), currents and salinity data were decomposed into various spatial and tempo-\n\nral means and their deviations. Near the channel\u2019s mouth, the main contributions to the salt transport\n\nare the terms due to freshwater discharge and the tidal correlation. Near the channel\u2019s head, this\n\nlast term is not so important as the gravitational circulation, which is enhanced by the increase of\n\nthe freshwater discharge. The remaining terms, which are dependent on the deviations from the mean\n\ndepth have a smaller role in the salt transport results. The computed salt transport per unit width\n\nof a section perpendicular to the mean flow is in close agreement to the sum of the advective and\n\ndispersive terms (within or very close to 12%). An imbalance of the salt budget across the sections is\n\nobserved for all the sampling periods.\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nAn estuary is defined as a semi-enclosed body of water having a free connection with the open sea\nand within sea water is diluted with freshwater derived from land drainage [Pritchard, 1967]. More\ncommonly, for oceanographers, engineers and natural scientists an estuary is an important and sensi-\nble area of interaction between fresh and salt water. These systems can, generally, be divided in three\nareas [Kjerfve, 1989]: (a) a marine or lower estuary, (b) a middle estuary where the mixing between\nthe fresh and salt water occurs and an (c) upper or fluvial estuary characterized by freshwater but\nsubject to a daily tidal action. The delimitation of these areas is dynamic and can change seasonally\n\n\n\n30 Salt fluxes in a complex river mouth system of Portugal\n\n(or in lower time scales) due to the tide, winds or the freshwater inflow [Kjerfve, 1990; Miranda et al.,\n2002].\n\nIn estuaries and tidal channels, which often transverse heavy populated regions, factors like\nsewage effluent or industrial waste reduce water quality, affecting people\u2019s health and other activities\nlike fisheries. The behavior of salt within this systems, its flux and transport due to advection and\nturbulent diffusion, provides a basis to predict the behavior of other soluble conservative substances\nsince the salt is a natural tracer.\n\nIn a tidal channel, the main mechanisms which drive the circulation and provide the turbulent\nenergy for mixing processes are the freshwater discharge and the barotropic and baroclinic compo-\nnents of the gradient pressure force due to tide and longitudinal salinity, respectively [Miranda and\nCastro Filho, 1996]. Under steady conditions, there is a balance between seaward advection and\nlandward mixing. This balance is due to the mixing process between oceanic salt water and fluvial\nfreshwater which mixes upchannel. Among the processes that causes mixing, longitudinal turbulent\n\ndiffusion plays a minor role and the overall landward mixing is better termed dispersion rather than\ndiffusion [Fischer, 1976; Hunkins, 1981; Miranda and Castro Filho, 1996]. Consequently, the ad-\nvective seaward salt transport is driven by the circulation components due to the river flow and the\nlandward salt dispersion is a consequence of the dispersion produced by the effects of tides, grav-\nitational circulation and winds. In this paper, the effect of mixing caused by freshwater discharge\nand tides is investigated in a tidal channel located in the northern coast of Portugal, the Espinheiro\nchannel.\n\nDuring the last decades, the salt balance and salt transport have been studied in several estuaries\nand coastal systems by many authors. Fischer [1972] and Dyer [1974] described a number of mech-\nanisms and methods by which the salt balance and dispersion are analyzed for partially and stratified\nestuaries. Among others, Hunkins [1981]; Miranda and Castro Filho [1996]; Be?rgamo [2000] have\ninvestigated the main driving forces of the non-tidal circulation and calculated the advective and dis-\npersive contributions to the salt transport in their studies for the Hudson and Canane?ia Sea estuaries.\nDyer et al. [1992] studied the cross-sectional salt balance in a tropical estuary and illustrated the dy-\nnamic coupling between the transverse and vertical contributions on a tidal and tidally averaged basis.\nMore recently, Simpson et al. [2001] and Banas et al. [2004] in their studies explore the hydrographic\nfeatures of two macrotidal highly energetic estuaries and compute the salt balance in those systems\ndue to tidal motion and river flow. Bowen and Geyer [2003] examined the mechanisms and variabil-\n\nity of salt transport at a relatively uniform section of the Hudson estuary using a 70-day moored time\nseries. MacCready and Geyer [2001]; MacCready et al. [2002] have explored the approach proposed\nby Dronkers and van de Kreeke [1986], in which the concept of looking at the salt flux through a\nvertical cross section which moves up and down the estuary with the tidal velocity was developed,\nand took a step forward, by using an actual isohaline as the surface through which salt and fluxes are\ncomputed, including long time scales and the case in which isohalines are ejected from the ocean\u00b4s\nend.\n\nThis work examines the main mechanisms that commands the salt transport in the Espinheiro\n\n\n\n3.2 The study area 31\n\nchannel, one of the four main branches of the Ria de Aveiro Lagoon. A brief description of the\nphysical characteristics of the channel is presented in Section 3.2. This channel connects the major\nsource of freshwater of the Ria de Aveiro to the Atlantic Ocean, rendering it ideal to perform these\nkind of studies. It crosses an important and traditional fishing area of the lagoon and has storage\nareas of chemical products along its margins, as well as the Aveiro fishing and comercial harbors.\nDespite these facts, this region has received almost no physical attention by the scientific community.\nThe exception are a few studies, based on field measurements of thermohaline properties and current\nvelocity, that examine the hydrologic characteristics of the lagoon in early Summer [Dias et al., 1999]\nand the horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in the central area of the lagoon [Vaz\net al., 2005a].\n\nThe main objective of this work is to calculate the advective and dispersive contributions for the\nsalt transport, with the salt transport computed per unit width of a section perpendicular to the channel\npassing through the fixed stations A and B, located near the mouth of the lagoon and 8 km upstream,\n\nrespectively. In this paper the water column stability is investigated using the Richardson number.\nThis work is based on the assumption that the channel can be considered laterally homogeneous, the\nmain components of the advective salt transport are due to the freshwater discharge and density-driven\ncurrents being the surface wind stress forcing negligible on the steady-state salinity and velocity\nprofiles. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 describe the study area and the sampling methodology used. Section 3.4\ndescribes the salt transport calculations and the following sections present the results and conclusions.\n\n3.2 The study area\n\nThe Espinheiro channel is one of the four main branches of Ria de Aveiro, a mesotidal and shallow\ncoastal lagoon (mean depth of about 1 m relative to the local datum) located in the northwest coast of\nthe Iberian Peninsula (see Figure 3.1). This channel is located in the very complex central area of the\nlagoon and it includes two distinct regions: the first extending from the mouth of the lagoon to near\nthe black solid line marked in Figure 3.1 and the second is the Espinheiro channel itself, extending\nfrom the referred line to near station B (about 2 km upstream). For simplicity, the study area from\nthe mouth of the lagoon (near station A) until station B will be hereinafter referred as Espinheiro\nchannel. The study area is approximately 11 km long, has an averaged width of about 200 m and a\nmean depth, along its longitudinal axis, of about 10 m. The tides are mixed semi-diurnal, being M2\nthe most important constituent, representing about 90% of the tidal energy [Dias et al., 1999].\n\nPrevious studies by Dias et al. [2000] and Dias [2001] revealed that the tide is strongly distorted\nas it progresses upstream from the mouth toward the end of the channels of the lagoon, due to changes\nin channel\u2019s geometry and bathymetry. The general characteristics of the tidal wave are those of a\ndamped progressive wave. Nevertheless, in shallow areas the tidal wave assumes the main character-\nistics of a standing wave.\n\nFrom a dynamical point of view, the Espinheiro channel may be considered the most important\narea of Ria de Aveiro, because the strongest currents are observed here, reaching values higher than\n\n\n\n32 Salt fluxes in a complex river mouth system of Portugal\n\nE\nsp\n\nin\nh\ne\nir\no\n\nC\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\nVouga River\nA\n\ntl\na\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\nS\n. \nJ\na\nc\nin\n\nto\n C\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\n8\u00ba45'\n\n38'\n\n41'\n\n40'\n\n37'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n0 200\n\nkm\n\nSpain\nA\n\nB\n\nFigure 3.1: The Espinheiro channel showing the survey sites A and B.\n\n2 ms?1. The lagoon\u2019s other channels are mainly shallow and tidal flat areas, contributing to a strong\ndumping of currents.\n\nThe estimated tidal prism for the lagoon at extreme spring and extreme neap is according to Dias\n[2001] 136.7\u00d7106 and 34.9\u00d7106 m3, respectively. Close to the black solid line it is about 40\u00d7106 at\nextreme spring and 15\u00d7106 m3 at extreme neap tide [Dias, 2001]. The total estimated freshwater input\nfor the lagoon is very small (about 1.8 \u00d7 106 m3 during a complete tidal cycle) [Moreira et al., 1993]\nwhen compared to the tidal prism, both at the mouth and at the beginning of Espinheiro channel.\nIn Ria de Aveiro, tidal currents are predominant, relatively to the currents induced by the rivers\ndischarge. Nevertheless, the freshwater inputs are very important in the establishment of the salinity\npatterns [Dias et al., 1999]. Although, the small contribution of the discharging rivers in terms of\nwater input, when compared to the tidal prism, they may have a long-term influence in the residual\ntransport [Dias et al., 2003].\n\nSeveral rivers discharge into Ria de Aveiro. The most important freshwater contribution is from\nVouga River. Its mouth is located near the head of the study area and therefore its freshwater inflow\nis determinant in the establishment of the channel\u2019s physical patterns. There is a study by Vicente\n[1985] presenting flood freshwater values of 3400 m3s?1 for a period of 25 years. The average flow\nfor Vouga river is referred by Borrego et al. [1990] as 25 m3s?1, but according to Vicente [1985] this\nvalue is underestimated. During the period from September 2003 to September 2004, measurements\nof the Vouga river\u2019s incoming flow were performed by the authors under the scope of this work and\nthe annual averaged flow value found was 31.45 m3s?1. The highest river flow values occurred during\nAutumn and the beginning of the Winter with a maximum of 143.16 m3s?1 in January. The minimum\nflows occur during the hotter seasons, with values ranging from 30 m3s?1 (early Spring) to 2.0 m3s?1\n\n(late Summer).\n\n\n\n3.3 Current and salinity measurements 33\n\n3.3 Current and salinity measurements\n\nVertical profiles of salinity and current velocity were sampled near the mouth of the channel (station\nA - 40?38.66\u2019N, 8?44.91\u2019W) and near the channel\u2019s head (station B - 40?41.29\u2019N, 8?39.03\u2019W) (see\nFigure 3.1). At both stations, the measurements were made in an anchor station placed in the middle\nof the channel. In these two locations, the cross-section has a regular geometry and the salinity\ndifferences between the two channel\u2019s sides are always less than 2 psu. Therefore, it seems to be fair\nthe assumption of a laterally homogeneous channel. At station A, two surveys were performed during\na neap and the following spring tide (February 2002). At station B, four surveys were performed, one\nfor each year season, during neap tide periods. The depths of stations A and B (during high tide) are\n25 and 6.5 m, respectively. The main tidal and river flow characteristics for the sampled periods are\nresumed in Table 3.1.\n\nTable 3.1: Resume of tidal and river discharge conditions during the survey periods.\nDate River flow [m3s?1] Tide Tidal range [m]\n\n21/02/2002 - neap 1.0\n28/02/2002 - spring 3.0\n15/01/2004 58.0 neap 1.7\n16/06/2004 11.2 neap 2.0\n27/08/2004 3.0 neap 1.8\n03/12/2004 5.0 neap 1.6\n\nThe station A measurements were taken during one tidal cycle in each survey and were performed\nby the Hydrographic Institute of the Portuguese Navy. The instruments used were an ADCP for the\ncurrent velocity measurements and a CTD for the salinity measurements. The ADCP is a Workhorse\nSentinel (RD Instruments) with a frequency of 614.4 Khz. This instrument measures current velocity\n\nin a range from 0 to 5 ms?1 with a resolution and an accuracy of 0.001 ms?1 and 0.25% of the water\nvelocity relative to the ADCP, respectively. The CTD used is an Idronaut model 316. This instrument\nmeasures water temperature in a range from -3 to 50 ?C with a resolution and an accuracy of 0.005\nand 0.003 ?C, respectively. The conductivity is measured from 0 to 64 mS/cm with a resolution\nand accuracy of 0.001 and 0.003 mS/cm. The salinity is calculated from the water temperature\nand conductivity data using the Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS78). The station B measurements\nwere taken during two consecutive tidal cycles, being used for the salinity measurements a SAIV\nA/S mini STD model SD204 and for the current velocity a Valeport current meter model 105. The\nSTD measures water temperature using a Thermistor that works in a range from -2 to 40?C with\nan accuracy of +/- 0.01?C. The water pressure is measured using a Piezoresistive sensor with an\naccuracy of +/- 0.02% of the depth (500 m) and for the conductivity the instrument uses an Inductive\ncell working in a range of 0 to 70 mS/cm with an accuracy of +/- 0.02 mS/cm. The salinity is\ncalculated from the conductivity, water temperature and water pressure in a range from 0 to 40 ppt\nwith an accuracy of 0.02 ppt. The current meter has a High Impact Styrene Impeller to measure the\ncurrent speed in a range of 0.1 to 5 ms?1 with an accuracy of \u00b12.5% of reading above 0.5 ms?1 and\n\n\n\n34 Salt fluxes in a complex river mouth system of Portugal\n\n\u00b10.01 ms?1 below 0.5 ms?1. The current direction is measured using a flux gate compass with a\nrange from 0-360? with a resolution of 0.5?.\n\nRiver flow values concurrent with station B surveys were estimated. Measurements of current\nspeed were obtained several km upstream from station B, 3 hours after the low tide hour predicted\nfor the lagoon\u2019s mouth. This procedure guarantees that the measurements of current speed were\nmade outside the region of tidal flood influence. The current velocity data were collected using the\nValeport current meter model 105 previously referred. In order to compute the flow, the river section\nwas divided in twenty four 2 m segments and the current velocity and the water depth measured for\neach segment. The current velocity was sampled at 60% of the water column following a standard\nprocedure. The total river flow was obtained adding all individual segment results.\n\nFrom the current velocity intensity and the direction original data, the current velocity was cal-\nculated along the main flow direction. The measurements were performed at lunar hourly intervals,\nfor a total of 13 (station A surveys) and 25 sampling times (station B surveys). Following a stan-\n\ndard procedure, the main direction velocity component (V -component) and the salinity profiles were\ncombined into a simultaneous lunar hourly measurements data set with constant depth intervals of\n0.5 (station A) and 0.2 m (station B), respectively. The sampling depth of each measurement was\nreduced to the non-dimensional depth [Z = z/h(t)], taking into account the local water depth [h(t)], to\nminimize the sampling water depth variations during the tidal cycle [Kjerfve, 1975]. Down the wa-\nter column, the measurements were interpolated from surface to bottom, in depth intervals of Z/10.\nThe surface and the bottom values were assigned one-half of the others when averaging over depth.\nFor the station B measurements, were considered two tidal cycles of 12.41 h (the M2 period) in the\ntime sequence and for the first and the last of the samples of each tidal cycle were assigned one-half\nthe weight of the others when averaging over time.The possible errors in the computation of the salt\ntransport were obtained using the methodology followed by Dyer [1974]; Miranda et al. [2005] by\nre-running the programmes using the bands of sensor precision of the equipment used.\n\n3.4 Salt transport and vertical stability\n\n3.4.1 Salt transport theory\n\nThe formulation used for the instantaneous advective mass transport of salt per unit width of a section,\nnormal to the longitudinal flow of the estuarine channel, is equal to\n\nMs =\n? h\n\n0\n?V S dz = ?V S .h (3.1)\n\nwhere ? is the density, V and S are the longitudinal velocity component and salinity, respectively. The\nupper bar denote averaging over the total depth of the water column, h. In the International System\nof Units (SI), the salt transport is given in kgm?1s?1.\n\n\n\n3.4 Salt transport and vertical stability 35\n\nThe non-tidal salt transport (T s) over one or more tidal cycles (T ) is given by\n\nT s =\n1\nT\n\n? T\n0\n\nMsdt = ? &lt;V S h > (3.2)\n\nwhere the mean density ? is assumed to be constant and the angle brackets denote averaging over one\nor more tidal cycles. The time interval T is a multiple integer of the tidal period.\n\nThe time-averages of depth-averages (residual values) of current velocity and salinity are given\nby\n\n&lt;V >=\n1\nT\n\n? T\n0\n\n[\n1\nh\n\n? h\n0\n\nV (x, z, t)dz\n]\n\ndt =\n1\nT\n\n? h\n0\n\nV dt (3.3)\n\n&lt;S >=\n1\nT\n\n? T\n0\n\n[\n1\nh\n\n? h\n0\n\nS (x, z, t)dz\n]\n\ndt =\n1\nT\n\n? h\n0\n\nS dt (3.4)\n\nIn the case of a tidal flow, only a part of the transport is described by the product of the tidal and\ndepth averages of the longitudinal component of the velocity (V -velocity) and salinity. As previously\nshown, various correlations between the tidally fluctuating salinity and velocity can be, generally,\nidentified with a particular physical process [Bowden, 1963; Fischer, 1976; Hunkins, 1981; Kjerfve,\n1986; Miranda and Castro Filho, 1996; Dyer, 1997]. Turbulent fluctuations, which have time scales\nsmaller than 1 minute, were not measured since only time scales of minutes or longer are of interest\nfor estuaries [Hunkins, 1981]. The correlations between fluctuating salinity and velocity at a given\npoint may be obtained through the decomposition of the instantaneous salinity and velocity profiles\ninto mean, tidal, steady and deviation terms. For a laterally homogeneous estuary or when the salt\n\ntransport is calculated per unit width of a section perpendicular to the mean flow at time t, these\nprofiles may be written as,\n\nV (x, z, t) = Va(x) + Vt(x, t) + Vs(x, z) + V\n?\n(x, z, t) (3.5)\n\nS (x, z, t) = S a(x) + S t(x, t) + S s(x, z) + S\n?\n(x, z, t) (3.6)\n\nwhere the mean component Va = &lt;V >, the tidal (barotropic) component Vt = V ? Va, the steady\n(steady-state baroclinic component of the vertical circulation) component Vs = &lt;V > ?Va, and the\ndeviation component V\n\n?\n= V ? Va ? Vt ? Vs. Similar expressions are valid in the S a, S t, S s and S\n\n?\n\ncomputation.\nThe local depth h(x, t) at the anchor station varies with the tidal height and may be decomposed\n\ninto two components [Miranda and Castro Filho, 1996],\n\nh(x, t) = ha + ht(x, t) (3.7)\n\nwhere ha = &lt;h > is the time-average water depth and ht(x, t) is the tidal height.\nIntroducing Equations (3.5), (3.6) and (3.7) into Equation (3.2), the advective salt transport under\n\nsteady-state conditions may be decomposed into 32 terms [Miranda and Castro Filho, 1996]. Many\n\n\n\n36 Salt fluxes in a complex river mouth system of Portugal\n\nof these terms vanish or may be neglected upon forming depth and time averages [Bowden, 1963; Fis-\ncher, 1976; Hunkins, 1981; Miranda and Castro Filho, 1996; Dyer, 1997] since, by definition, &lt;Vt >\n= V s = &lt;V\n\n?\n> = V? = 0, and similarly for salinity. Only the product of similar V and S components\n\nare considered. Other terms which have no physical reason, since no expected correlations between\nsteady, tidal and deviation components exists, are neglected. This leaves seven terms and the total\nsalt transport, per unit width, during a tidal cycle is described by,\n\nT s = ?[[ Vaha????\n(a)\n\n+ &lt;htVt >?    ??    ?\n(b)\n\n]S a + ha &lt;VtS t >?        ??        ?\n(c)\n\n+ haVsS s?  ??  ?\n(d)\n\n+ ha &lt;V\n?S ? >?         ??         ?\n\n(e)\n\n+ &lt;VtS tht >?       ??       ?\n( f )\n\n+ Va &lt;S tht >?        ??        ?\n(g)\n\n] (3.8)\n\nThe first two terms of Equation 3.8 represent the seaward salt advection by the mean current and\nStokes wave transport. This two terms ((a) and (b)) taken together give the transport of mean salinity\nby freshwater discharge. This process tends to turn the estuary clear of salt and sharpen the frontal\ngradient between the river and ocean [Hunkins, 1981]. The remaining terms are considered to repre-\nsent landward dispersion of salt through mixing by various processes, decreasing the frontal gradient.\nOnly term (d), the correlation of tidal salinity and current, may be either dispersive or in some cases it\nmay act in the same direction as (a) and (b), increasing the frontal gradient [Hunkins, 1981]. Several\nauthors related these terms to certain physical mechanisms which are listed in Table 3.2 [Bowden,\n1963; Fischer, 1976; Hunkins, 1981; Kjerfve, 1986; Miranda and Castro Filho, 1996; Dyer, 1997].\n\nTable 3.2: Physical processes related to the terms of Equation 3.8\nTerm Physical processes\n(a) Freshwater discharge or residual velocity\n(b) Stokes drift or progressive tidal wave transport\n(c) Topographic trapping\n(d) Gravitational circulation, bathymetric tidal pumping and steady wind effect\n(e) Tidal shear and unsteady wind effect\n(f) Tide dispersion via triple correlation\n(g) Net advection of cross correlation between salt and tide\n\nUnder steady conditions, there is no net transport and the sum of the right hand side terms of\nEquation 3.8 should be zero. Equations (3.2) and (3.8) are distinct mathematical expressions of the\nsame quantity. Therefore, in order to check the computational procedure and if the neglected terms\nare in fact small, a comparison of the net salt transport results computed using both equations will be\nused.\n\n3.4.2 Water column stability\n\nHere, the water column stability during a tidal cycle is investigated through the determination of the\nRichardson number. Due to some difficulties on measuring precisely the gradients used to compute\n\n\n\n3.5 Results and discussion 37\n\nthis number, it can be defined the layer Richardson number [Dyer, 1997]. It is given by,\n\nRiL =\ngh4?\nU 2?\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere, h = h(t) is the local depth, 4? is the difference between the seabed and surface density and\nU = U(t) is the depth averaged velocity. Dyer [1982]; Dyer and New [1986] defined RiL = 20 as the\nlimit below which the turbulent mixing occurs closer to the halocline in partially mixed estuaries.\n\nIf RiL > 20, mixing is small. When this value is smaller than 20 the bottom turbulence increases,\nand the stratification decreases. If RiL &lt;2 the turbulence becomes isotropic and the mixing is fully\ndeveloped [Dyer, 1997]. Using this range (2 &lt;RiL &lt;20) as a simplified mixing criterium, it is\npossible to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of the vertical stability of the water column.\nThis method was used by Be?rgamo [2000] and Mantovanelli [1999] to study the gravitational stability\nat anchor stations.\n\n3.5 Results and discussion\n\n3.5.1 Currents, salinity results\n\nFigures 3.2 and 3.3 show the temporal evolution of the salinity and longitudinal velocity profiles\nfor the surveys performed. Figures 3.2a and 3.2b reveal almost no stratification. The lower salinity\nvalues appear near low tide. During the February 21 survey, the water column is always well mixed\nexcept in the two hours before and after the low water when the differences between the surface and\nbottom salinity is 2.5 psu. Near the mouth of the channel, the higher velocities are reached during\nebb, with values of -1.0 and -2.0 ms?1 as shown in Figures 3.3a and 3.3b.\n\nThe profiles of non-tidal velocity and salinity are shown in Figures 3.4 and 3.5. Station A results\nreveal almost no gravitational circulation, especially during the second survey (February 28th). The\ndifference between surface and bottom salinity is lower than 1 psu (in both surveys) (figures a and b).\nThe non-tidal velocity is seaward along almost all the water column. Near the surface, the velocity\nmaximum is -0.24 and -0.17 ms?1 during the first and second survey, respectively. During the first\nsurvey, an inversion of the non-tidal velocity is visible close to the bottom (Z=-0.7). The Layer\nRichardson number present values lower than 2 and increasing to 20 during the time interval of 1\n\nhour before and after low tide, revealing a well mixed water column. For the February 28 survey, the\nLayer Richardson number present values lower than 20 during all the tidal cycle, which mean that no\nstratification is observed.\n\nFrom station B results several features should be addressed. This anchor station was placed closed\nto the mouth of the Vouga River, and therefore the circulation is strongly influenced not only by the\ntidal flow but also by the freshwater inflow. Furthermore, this location is narrow (approximately 60\nm wide) and relatively shallow (maximum of 6.5 m depth during the high water in this location).\nThe tidal and freshwater inflow are resumed in Table 3.1.

This dam is builded\nduring the dryer seasons to protect the low-land of Baixo-Vouga (agricultural fields) and a paper mill\nresidual waters station of the salinity intrusion, being opened during a short period of time when the\nlocal low tide is reached.\n\nDuring the January and December surveys, the estimated freshwater inflow was 58 and 5 m3s?1,\nrespectively. During this survey periods, the salinity and velocity evolution (Figures 3.2c, 3.2f, 3.3c\n\n\n\n40 Salt fluxes in a complex river mouth system of Portugal\n\nand 3.3f) reveal that a stratification/destratification event takes place. The stratification increases\nduring the flood period, reaching its maximum one hour before the high water. Stratification decreases\nduring the ebb until the local low water hour. The entire water column is filled with freshwater\npropagating from the river during the beginning of the flood period. During the December survey,\nwhen the discharge from the river is lower, the water column present values of 5 psu during the\nbeginning of the flood. The vertical lunar hourly profiles of the longitudinal velocity indicates an\nasymmetry between flood (~V > 0) and ebb (~V &lt;0) currents. The ebb currents are higher than the\nflood currents, reaching maximums of -1.0 and 0.3 ms?1 during the January survey and -0.8 and 0.3\nms?1 during the December survey, respectively. A similar current velocity asymmetry was observed\nby Miranda et al. [2004] in studying the dynamics of a tropical estuary, the Curimatau? River, NE\nBrazil. The non-tidal current profiles show that the current is seaward through all the water column\n(Figure 3.5c) being visible a inversion near the bottom (Z = -0.8) during the December survey (Figure\n3.5f). The surface maximums are -0.58 and -0.5 ms?1 during January and December, respectively.\nThe non-tidal salinity profiles present values close to 0 psu near the surface increasing in depth to\nvalues of 17.2 (January) and 20.3 psu (December).\n\nThe stability of the water column is evaluated using the Layer Richardson number. In January\n(Figure 3.6c), this adimensional number present values lower than 20 during the low tide, revealing a\nreduction of the stratification and consequently a mixing increase. The maximum values are reached\none hour before high water when the stratification is fully developed. For December (Figure 3.6f)\nthis number present values higher than 20, revealing the high stability of the water column, except\nduring the low tide hours, when a stratification reduction occurs and the turbulent mixing increases.\n\n0 4 8 12\n10\n\n?2\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n6\n\nR\ni L\n\nTime [hours]\n\n21/02/2002 Sta.

Although, the estimated freshwater inflow of\n11.2 and 3.0 m3s?1 during the June and August campaigns be higher and of the same order than the\nDecember value, the water column is saltier than in the winter. This is due to the dam located 2 km\nupstream which is open only during a short period of time. In fact, the freshwater is \u201dstored\u201d upstream\nof the dam and during the local low water hour the structure is open and during a limited period of\ntime it discharge freshwater into the channel. As it can be seen in Figure 3.2d and 3.2e is after the\nlow water that is reached the minimum values of salinity, 5 and 10 psu, respectively. Close to the\nchannel\u2019s bed, the salinity is always higher than 30 psu revealing the presence of ocean water. The\ncurrent velocity evolution (Figures 3.3d and 3.3e) show low velocity values, ranging from -0.4 and\n0.2 ms?1 during June and -0.3 and 0.2 ms?1 during the August campaign. Once more, the asymmetry\nbetween ebb and flood currents is observed. The vertical profiles of non-tidal velocity and salinity\nconfirm the results presented before. The ebb currents are higher than the flood ones with maximums\n\nsurface values of -0.29 (Figure 3.5d) and -0.27 ms?1 (Figure 3.5e). It is observed an inversion of\nthe current velocity near the half water column (Z = -0.6) (ebb to flood currents) with maximums of\n0.093 (Figure 3.5d) and 0.072 ms?1 (Figure 3.5e) for the June and August surveys, respectively. The\nsalinity profiles show brackish surface values with maximums of 15.3 and 18.2 psu during the June\nand August surveys, respectively. These values increase toward the bottom to values higher than 34\npsu. During these two campaigns, the Layer Richardson number present values always higher than\n20, revealing a highly stable water column (see Figure 3.6d and 3.6e for reference).\n\n3.5.2 Salt transport results\n\nThe salt transport method presented in Section 3.4.1 has been applied to compute the relative contri-\n\nbution of the individual terms of Equation 3.8, in systems with several degrees of stratification, and\nthe results are reported in several studies cited previously. The variation of the relative contribution of\nthe salt transport terms to the net upstream transport, during neap and spring tides, have been studied\nby Lewis and Lewis [1983] in their study in the Tees Estuary.\n\nThe net salt transport and its advective and dispersive components obtained from the application\nof this methodology for stations A and B are show in Table 3.3. As a check on the use of Equation 3.8,\nto evaluate the computational method, a calculation was made using Equation 3.2 and the results are\ncompared. There was agreement between the two calculations within 12% for almost all the survey\nperiods. The exception is the January results when the results are significatively different. This result\nmay be due to the large river flow (58 m3s?1) which combined with the tidal propagation address to\nthat location some salt wedge characteristics. This 12% value was considered acceptable by Hunkins\n[1981] and Miranda and Castro Filho [1996]. The agreement between both calculations confirm that\nthe terms omitted to obtain Equation 3.8 were in fact small.\n\nAccording to the results, the main contribution to the salt transport is from term (a). The sum\nof term (a) and (b), which represent salt transport due to the freshwater discharge, is negative for all\n\n\n\n42 Salt fluxes in a complex river mouth system of Portugal\n\nsurveys indicating a seaward (advective) salt transport due to the non-tidal velocity induced by the\nriver discharge. At station A, term (a) almost double (-59.33\u00b10.51 to -105.48\u00b10.61 kgm?1s?1) from\nthe neap tide period of February 21 to the following spring tide. At station B, this term is higher\nduring the January and December surveys than during the June and August surveys, presenting a\nmaximum of -12.61\u00b10.41 during the January survey and a minimum of -7.96\u00b10.57 kgm?1s?1 during\nthe August survey.\n\nTable 3.3: Salt transport in the Espinheiro channel [kgm?1s?1].\nStation A A B B B B\nDate 21/02/2002 28/02/2002 15/01/2004 16/06/2004 27/08/2004 03/12/2004\n(a) -59.33\u00b10.51 -105.48\u00b10.61 -12.61\u00b10.41 -8.08\u00b10.52 -7.96\u00b10.57 -11.26\u00b10.39\n(b) 2.95\u00b10.10 23.87\u00b10.80 0.43\u00b10.01 0.46\u00b10.01 0.94\u00b10.06 0.33\u00b10.01\n(c) 5.53\u00b10.31 14.42\u00b10.82 1.81\u00b10.04 -0.03\u00b10.02 -0.12\u00b10.01 0.27\u00b10.01\n(d) 0.35\u00b10.01 0.04\u00b10.01 6.78\u00b10.14 4.00\u00b10.20 3.48\u00b10.17 6.85\u00b10.18\n(e) 0.34\u00b10.01 0.44\u00b10.01 3.97\u00b10.05 0.54\u00b10.03 0.22\u00b10.02 1.51\u00b10.02\n(f) 0.00 -0.06\u00b10.001 -0.033\u00b10.001 0.00 0.00 -0.030\u00b10.002\n(g) -0.02\u00b10.001 -0.09\u00b10.005 -0.98\u00b10.03 -0.11\u00b10.01 -0.12\u00b10.01 -0.030\u00b10.002?\n\n(a) ?

Having a positive sign it represent a landward (disper-\nsive) tidal wave transport of salt contribution. In this channel, as in many others estuaries and tidal\nchannels, there is a progressive wave component, which means that the high water occurs at max-\nimum flood and low water at maximum ebb. So, the water is carried out up estuary and its mean\nsalt content with it. This is the Stokes Drift associated with a finite-amplitude tidal wave propagat-\ning back and forth into the channel. At station A, this term is higher during the spring tide survey\nthan in the neap survey, 23.87\u00b10.80 and 2.95\u00b10.10 kgm?1s?1, respectively. At station B this term\nis close to zero, presenting a maximum and minimum value of 0.94\u00b10.06 and 0.43\u00b10.01 kgm?1s?1\nduring the August and January survey, respectively. These values may be explained by the tidal wave\ncharacteristics in this region of the channel. Station B is located near the channel\u2019s head (close to the\nriver\u2019s mouth) and as Dias et al. [2000] found in their work, as the tidal wave propagates from deeper\ntoward shallow areas of the lagoon, due to the shore\u2019s reflections, the wave characteristics move from\nprogressive to standing wave. In the case of a standing wave, tidal elevation and tidal velocity would\nhave a phase difference of 90?, so this term, which is averaged over a tidal cycle would be zero. This\ndoes not happens, because at this point, the tidal wave has a progressive and a standing component.\n\nThis feature is visible not only due to the location of the survey point, which is placed on a shallow\narea, but also due to the presence of a dam 2 km upstream. Therefore, the Stokes wave transport\npresents positive values (close to zero), which mean a tidal wave transport up the channel.\n\nThe tidal correlation term (c) switches sign from the colder to the warmer season surveys. During\nthe January and December surveys, this term (c) is positive (dispersive) contributing to carry salt into\nthe channel. The opposite, a seaward contribution to the salt transport, occur during the June and\nAugust surveys. At station A, this value is maximum during the February 28 survey, (14.42\u00b10.82\nkgm?1s?1). Hunkins [1981] refer that in an idealized well mixed estuary the phase difference be-\n\n\n\n3.5 Results and discussion 43\n\ntween Vt and S t would be 90?, since the maximum salinity is reached at the end of the flood tide,\nand therefore the contribution of this term to the net transport would be zero since their integral in\nquadrature is zero. Fischer et al. [1979] suggested that trapping of water by topographic irregularities\ncould lead to a phase difference lower than 90?. That is, in a system like Espinheiro channel with\na major channel and several side branches, the tidal elevation and velocities are not in phase in the\nmain channel. The momentum of the flow in the main channel causes the current to continue to flow\nagainst an opposing pressure gradient. On the other hand, the side channel has less momentum and\nthe current direction changes when the water level begins to drop. At this stage, the water in the side\nchannel return into the main stream in a different tidal hour, leading to a phase difference between\nS t and Vt lower than 90?. This can explain the positive sign of the colder seasons surveys, but not\nthe other results. If the phase difference is higher than 90?, as observed by Miranda and Castro Filho\n[1996] and Hunkins [1981] term (c) will be negative. This can be observed in two-layered estuaries,\nwhere the longitudinal salinity gradients are lower in the bottom layer than in the upper layer of the\n\nestuary. So, the tidal salinity oscillation is reduced in the bottom layer. The tidal current near the bot-\ntom leads the tidal current in the upper layer on account of friction effects. Then, the tide turn from\nebb to flood earlier in the bottom layer. The depth averaged velocity Vt will be advanced an amount\nintermediate between the surface and bottom values. In opposition, the depth averaged salinity will\nbe little influenced by the bottom layer salinity oscillation and will follow the surface salinity values.\nThis makes the phase difference higher than 90? with the consequent negative term (c) values.\n\nTerm (d) which represents the gravitational circulation, is positive, that is directly landward\n(dispersive). At station A, this term is residual, presenting values of 0.35\u00b10.01 (February 21) and\n0.04\u00b10.01 kgm?1s?1 (February 28). These values confirm the analysis made in Section 3.5.1 where\nthe non-tidal velocity and salinity figures reveal almost no gravitational circulation. At station B,\nthis term (d) is one of the most important in driving the salt transport. A pronounced gravitational\ncirculation is observed in all survey periods as depicted in Figures 3.4 and 3.5. This term is higher\nduring the January and December surveys, presenting a maximum of 6.85\u00b10.18 kgm?1s?1 reached\nduring the December survey. The minimum value is found during the August survey with a value\nof 3.48\u00b10.17 kgm?1s?1. At station B, this term increases by at least one order of magnitude when\ncompared to station A results. In a well mixed estuary, high freshwater inflow may flush out the\nsalt almost completely, but in a partially mixed estuary when the freshwater discharge increase, the\ncompensating bottom current also increases carrying salt up estuary, turning the circulation results\n\nmore vigorous.\nTerm (e), which is associated with tidal shear or unsteady wind effect, is not relevant for station\n\nA salt transport results. In fact, in this station, the results reveal marginally small values for terms\n(e), (f) and (g) when compared to the other terms. However, at station B, the results show that this\nterm has the same order of magnitude as the gravitational circulation term for the colder seasons\nsurveys (January and December), presenting values of 3.79\u00b10.05 (January) and 1.51\u00b10.02 kgm?1s?1\n(December). This term is positive for all the surveys, being consequently dispersive. Terms (f) and\n\n\n\n44 Salt fluxes in a complex river mouth system of Portugal\n\n(g) present residual values for all the survey periods. These terms are dependent of the tidal amplitude\nand their small values are due to the moderate tidal amplitude of the forcing tidal wave.\n\nIn the absence of sampling errors, under steady conditions, the sum of terms (a) to (g) in Table 3.3\nwould be zero. In all the surveys this sum was not zero but negative. In fact, the highest disagreement\nbetween the sum of all terms and the value calculated using Equation 3.2 occur during the January\nsurvey. This disagreement may be explained but the high river runoff observed during that survey.\nThis fact conjugated with a moderate tide address to this fixed point salt wedge characteristics, result-\ning in a high-stratified location. Apparently, in this case the major contribution to the salt transport is\nthe entrainment process, i.e. the upward flux of salt with little or no horizontal diffusion. The calcu-\nlation method used in this work does not capture this process, since it is not included into Equation\n3.8. All the results reveal an imbalance in the net advective salt budget and during all the survey\nperiods the channel was exporting salt. This imbalance may be due to a wrong previous assumption\non the laterally characteristics (homogeneity) of the survey locations. Another fact that can influence\n\nthe results is that this channel is located in the very complex central area of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon,\nwhere the study area has an enormous amount of side channels discharging into the main one, influ-\nencing the circulation characteristics. The results may be strongly influenced by the wind conditions.\nLocal winds tend to increase the gravitational circulation, leading to positive dispersion values. As\nHunkins [1981] refer in his work the loss of salt by the channel is probably influenced by large-scale\nwind gradients over all the lagoon and adjacent continental shelf which drives salt transport toward\nthe ocean. Such wind-driven effect is not captured by the terms (a) and (b) and a much longer time\nseries is needed to determined its behavior.\n\n3.6 Conclusions\n\nThe two locations studied in this work represent sensible and important areas of the Espinheiro chan-\nnel. Station A, located near the channel\u2019s mouth is important because the channel has only a connec-\ntion between its interior and the adjacent ocean and the channel\u2019s dynamics is strongly influenced by\nthe tidal flow. Station B, located near the channel\u2019s head, close to Rio Vouga\u2019s mouth, is located in\na ecological important area, where the existence of a paper industry turn important the quantification\nof the amount of conservative particles, like salinity or others, that enters into the channel with the\nfluvial flow.\n\nIt is found that near the mouth of the channel, at station A, the main contributions to the transport\nof salt are the transport due to the freshwater discharge (terms (a) and (b)) and the tidal correlation\nterm (c). At this location, the net salt transport accounts more than 80% of the downstream salt trans-\nport component driven by the freshwater discharge. At station B, near the channel\u2019s head, the major\ncontributions to the salt transport are the transport due to the freshwater discharge and the gravita-\ntional circulation. The tidal shear term (e) is found to be, during the January and December surveys,\nof the same order of magnitude of the gravitational circulation term, but one order of magnitude lower\nduring the other two surveys. The net salt transport accounts, on average, 31% for the salt flushed by\n\n\n\n3.6 Conclusions 45\n\nthe river. In regions so close to the river\u2019s mouth as the one studied here (station B), the gravitational\ncirculation plays a major contribution to the salt transport, i.e. in regions where the river inflow plays\na major role, a compensating bottom current is originated near the bottom to carry salt up estuary,\nbalancing the salt flushed out by the river.\n\nThe presence of a small dam 2 km upstream of station B, from May to October, influences the\nresults. In fact, this dam is open just for a short period of time when the local low tide is reached\nand it functions as a barrier to the tidal evolution further upstream. Thus, the tidal wave, which is a\nprogressive wave, gain in this region some standing wave characteristics and at this point, the mixing\nincreases and the estuary becomes well mixed, turning the phase difference between Vt and S t close\nto 90?. This changing in the characteristics of the tidal wave acts to reduce the tidal correlation to\nvalues close to zero.\n\nIn the absence of sampling errors and assuming a steady condition, the sum of all terms in Equa-\ntion 3.8 would be zero. This does not happens and during all surveys a salt imbalance is found\n\nmeaning that the estuary is in fact exporting salt. The rates are presented in Table 3.3, indicating a\nseaward salt transport.\n\nIn spite these kind of short term surveys, during one or two tidal cycles, are too small to give\ninformation about meteorological effect influencing salt transport, they can produce valuable results\nabout processes on tidal and subtidal time scales. Sampling strategies like the one followed in the data\nacquisition, with just one station in the middle of the channel, without assessing the results against the\ntidal strength (neap and spring periods), changes in the bathymetry or magnitude of the longitudinal\ndensity gradient, could lead to a salt transport value that ends up as a number only meaningful for\nthe specific conditions under which the measurements where made [Jay et al., 1997]. Nevertheless,\nthis study must be understood as a first step in the understanding of the circulation of a barely studied\narea. Due to the lack of observational program, the total salt budget of the channel can only be\nstudied using three-dimensional numerical models which allows the coverage of all channel during\nmuch higher time scales.\n\n\n\n46 Salt fluxes in a complex river mouth system of Portugal\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe numerical model\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nThe numerical model used in this work is Mohid, a three-dimensional baroclinic model under devel-\nopment at the Instituto Superior Te?cnico (Universidade Te?cnica de Lisboa) [Santos, 1995; Martins\net al., 2001]. In its initial versions [Santos, 1995], a finite difference approach was implemented in the\ndiscretization. In the present, a finite volume discretization approach has been implemented [Martins\net al., 2001], allowing the use of a generic vertical coordinate. Mohid has been applied to several dif-\nferent coastal and estuarine areas and has shown its ability to simulate complex features of the flows.\nAlong the Portuguese coast, several environment have been studied, from river mouths (Douro and\nMondego) to coastal lagoons (Ria de Aveiro [Trancoso et al., 2005; Vaz et al., 2005a] and Ria For-\nmosa) and broader estuaries (Tagus [Braunschweig et al., 2003] and Sado estuaries [Martins et al.,\n2001]). Moreover, the model has been implemented to simulate the Galician Rias hydrodynamics\n(Ria de Vigo [Taboada et al., 1998; Montero, 1999], Ria de Pontevedra [Villarreal et al., 2002]). Far\nfrom the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, some European estuaries have been studied (Western\nScheltd, Holland, and Gironde, France, [Cancino and Neves, 1999] and Hellingford [Leita?o, 1996])\n\nas well as some coastal estuaries in Brazil (Santos and Fortaleza). Regarding the open sea, Mohid has\nbeen applied to the north-east Atlantic region where some processes including the Portuguese coastal\ncurrent [Coelho et al., 1994, 2001], the slope current along the shelf [Neves et al., 1999] and the\ngeneration of internal tides [Neves et al., 1998] have been studied, and also to the Mediterranean Sea\nto simulate the seasonal cycle [Taboada, 1999] or the circulation in the Alboran Sea [Santos, 1995].\n\n4.2 The numerical model equations\n\nMohid solves the three-dimensional incompressible primitive equations. Hydrostatic equilibrium is\nassumed as well as the Boussinesq and Reynolds approximations. All the equations below have\nbeen derived taken into account these approximations. A detailed derivation of the model equations\n\n\n\n48 The numerical model\n\nwas presented in several studies [Santos, 1995; Martins et al., 2001; Leita?o, 2003]. The hydrostatic\napproximation is assumed with:\n\n?z\n?p\n\n= ??g (4.1)\n\nwhere g is gravity and ? is density. If the atmospheric pressure patm is subtracted from p, and density\n? is divided into a constant reference density ?0 and a deviation component ??, after integrating from\nthe free surface ? to the depth z where pressure is calculated, it is obtained:\n\np(z) = patm + g?(?? z) + g\n?\n\nz\n???dz (4.2)\n\nThis equation relates pressure at any depth with the atmospheric pressure at the sea surface, the sea\nlevel and the anomalous pressure integrated between the level and the surface. By using the Boussi-\nnesq approximation - where the density variation are fairly small (? 3%), to a first approximation\ntheir effect on the fluid\u2019s mass can be neglected but must be retained on the weight, and therefore the\nchanges in the horizontal acceleration due to the fluid\u2019s mass variation resulting from the density is\nnegligible - the horizontal pressure gradient in the xi directions can be divided into:\n\n?p\n?xi\n\n=\n?patm\n?xi\n\n? g?0\n??\n\n?xi\n? g\n\n?\n\nz\n?\n???\n\n?xi\ndz (4.3)\n\nThe total pressure gradient is the sum of the gradients of the atmospheric pressure, the sea surface\nelevation (barotropic pressure gradient) and the density distribution (baroclinic pressure gradient).\nThis decomposition is substituted in the 3D incompressible primitive equations and yields to the\nmass momentum equation:\n\n?ui\n?t\n\n+\n?(uiu j)\n?x j\n\n= ? 1\n?0\n\n?patm\n?xi\n\n? g?(?)\n?0\n\n??\n\n?xi\n? g\n?0\n\n? ?\nx3\n\n???\n\n?xi\nd x3\n\n+\n?\n\n?x j\n(?\n?ui\n?x j\n\n) ? 2?i jk? juk (4.4)\n\nwhere ui are the velocity vector components in the Cartesian xi directions, ? is the turbulent viscosity\nand patm is the atmospheric pressure. ? is the density, ?? is its anomaly, ?0 is the reference density,\n?(?) represents the density at the free surface, g is the acceleration of gravity, t is the time, ? is the\nEarth\u2019s velocity of rotation and ? is the alternate tensor.\n\nThe mass balance equation (continuity) is:\n\n?ui\n?xi\n\n= 0 (4.5)\n\nThe density ? is calculated as a function of temperature and salinity by the equation of state\n[Leendertse and Liu, 1978]:\n\n\n\n4.3 Equations discretization 49\n\n? = (5890 + 38T ? 0.375T 2 + 3S )/((1779.5 + 11.25T ? 0.0745T 2) ? (3.8 + 0.01T )S\n+ 0.698(5890 + 38T ? 0.375T 2 + 3S )) (4.6)\n\nThis equation is an approximation for shallow water of the most widely used UNESCO equation\n[UNESCO, 1981].\n\nThe vertical velocity is calculated from the continuity equation by integrating between the bottom\nand the depth z where u3 is to be calculated:\n\nu3(x3) =\n?\n\n?x1\n\n? x3\n?h\n\nu1d x3 ?\n?\n\n?x2\n\n? x3\n?h\n\nu2d x3 (4.7)\n\nThe free surface equation is obtained by integrating the continuity equation over the whole water\ncolumn:\n\n??\n\n?t\n=\n\n?\n\n?x1\n\n? ?\n?h\n\nu1d x3 ?\n?\n\n?x2\n\n? ?\n?h\n\nu2d x3 (4.8)\n\nThe model also solves a transport equation for salinity, water temperature or any other tracer:\n\n??\n\n?t\n+ u j\n\n??\n\n?x j\n=\n\n?\n\n?x j\n(K\n\n??\n\n?x j\n) + F P (4.9)\n\nwhere ? is the transported property, K is the diffusion coefficient and F P is a possible source or sink\nterm.\n\n4.3 Equations discretization\n\n4.3.1 Spatial discretization\n\nMohid uses a finite volume approach [Chippada et al., 1998; Martins et al., 2001] to discretize the\n\nequations. Using this approach, the discrete form of the governing equations is applied macroscopi-\ncally to a cell control volume. This approach uses the conservation equations in an integral form. A\ngeneral conservation law for a generic quantity ? with sources (and sinks) s in a control volume ? is\nthen written as:\n\n?\n\n?t\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?d?\n?       ??       ?\ntimederivative\n\n+\n\n?\n\nS\n?v.ndS\n\n?      ??      ?\nadvection\n\n+\n\n?\n\n?\n\nsd?\n?  ??  ?\n\nsources?sinks\n\n= 0 (4.10)\n\nAfter discretizing this expression in a cell control volume ? j where ? j is defined, is obtained:\n\n?\n\n?t\n(? j? j) +\n\n?\n\nf aces\n\n?v.n.~S = Q j? j (4.11)\n\nThis way, the procedure for solving the equations is independent of the cell geometry. According\n\n\n\n50 The numerical model\n\nto Martins [2000] and Montero [1999] the cell can have any shape with only some constraints since\nonly fluxes among cell faces are required. Therefore, it is achieved a complete separation between\nphysical variables and geometry [Hiersch, 1980]. The geometry is updated in every time step after\ncomputing the physical variables since the volumes can vary in the course of the calculus. More-\nover, the spatial coordinates are independent, and any geometry can be chosen for every dimension.\nCartesian and curvilinear coordinates are used in the horizontal and in the vertical a generic vertical\ncoordinate with different sub-domains can be used. In is study Martins et al. [2001] pointed that this\ngeneric vertical coordinate minimizes the errors of some of the classical vertical coordinates (carte-\nsian, isopycnal, sigma). Along the vertical direction the cell vertices have only a degree of freedom,\nbeing fixed in the horizontal plane. In the horizontal, the grid is staggered in an Arakawa C manner\n[Arakawa and Lamb, 1977], i.e. horizontal velocities are located in the center of the cell faces and\nelevation, turbulent magnitudes and any tracer are placed in the element center. Also in the vertical a\nstaggering is used, with the vertical velocity, tracers and turbulent magnitudes placed in the top and\n\nbottom faces and horizontal velocities and elevation in the center.\n\n4.3.2 Temporal discretization: the ADI algorithm\n\nThe temporal discretization is carried out using a semi-implicit algorithm: the ADI - Alternate Direc-\ntion Implicit (see Abbott and Basco [1994]). This algorithm calculates alternatively one component\nof horizontal velocity implicitly while the other is calculated explicitly, avoiding the computation\nof the internal and external modes with different time steps (mode splitting approach). The result-\ning equation system is tridiagonal, and can be solved using the Thomas algorithm. This allows the\npreservation of the stability advantages of implicit methods without increasing the computational ef-\nfort and associate phase errors. Also, this method allows the use of a longer time-step. The model has\n\ntwo discretization schemes coded: a 4 equations with two time level per iteration, the S21 scheme\n[Abbott et al., 1973], and the 6 equation algorithm by Leendertse [1967] (see Equation 4.12), more\nconvenient when modelling systems with intertidal areas, since velocities are updated every half time\nstep. In this study, only the 6 equation scheme is used.\n\nut+1/22 ?? ?t+1/2(u\nt+1/2\n1 , u\n\nt\n2) ?? u\n\nt+1/2\n1 ?? u\n\n?t+1/2\n3\n\nGeometryU pdate?? ut+1/23\n??

S t+1, T t+1 (4.12)\n\nIn this case, the ADI scheme is applied to Equation 4.5 in order to calculate the free surface elevation.\nBasically, all the velocity integral in one direction is substituted by a momentum conservation equa-\ntion keeping, in the orthogonal direction, the velocity explicit. A full description of the discretization\n\ncan be found in several studies like Martins [2000], Montero [1999], Leita?o [2003] or Theias [2005].\n\n\n\n4.4 Boundary conditions 51\n\n4.4 Boundary conditions\n\n4.4.1 Free surface\n\nAt the free surface boundary all advective fluxes across the surface are assumed null, i.e. imposing a\nnull W vertical flux:\n\nW f lux |sur f ace= 0 (4.13)\n\nDiffusive flux of momentum is imposed assuming explicitly a wind surface stress, ~?W :\n\n?3\n?ui\n?x3\n|sur f ace= ~?W, i = 1, 2 (4.14)\n\nwhere ?3 is the vertical eddy viscosity. The wind stress is calculated according to a quadratic friction\n\nlaw:\n\n~?W = CD?a ~W | ~W | (4.15)\n\nwhere CD is a drag coefficient that is a function of the wind speed, ?a is the air density and ~W is the\nwind speed measured 10 m above the sea surface. In this study, the wind stress was not considered.\n\nTemperature and salinity advective fluxes are imposed null. Other fluxes of heat and freshwater\nare introduced as a source (or a sink) term in the transport equation 4.9\n\n4.4.2 Bottom boundary\n\nAt the bottom, the water flux is also assumed to be null and the bottom stress is calculated using a\nnon-slip method with a quadratic law that depends on the near bottom velocity. This condition can\nbe expressed by:\n\n?3\n?ui\n?x3\n|bottom= CDui\n\n?\nu21 + u\n\n2\n2, i = 1, 2 (4.16)\n\nwhere CD is the bottom drag coefficient, which is calculated for 2D (Equation 4.17) and 3D (Equation\n4.18) flows by:\n\nCD = gn\n2 H?1/3 (4.17)\n\nCD =\n(\n\n?\n\nlg\nz+zb0\n\nzb0\n\n)\n(4.18)\n\nwhere g is the gravity, n is the Manning coefficient, H is the depth of the water column, ? is the von\nKarman constant and zb0 is the bottom roughness length. For stability reasons, this term is calculated\nimplicitly in the momentum equation of the bottom cell, using a procedure described in Backhaus\n[1983]. No salinity and temperature fluxes are considered at the bottom.\n\n\n\n52 The numerical model\n\n4.4.3 Lateral closed boundaries\n\nThe closed boundaries of the domain corresponds to land. A free slip condition is used to resolve this\nlateral boundary:\n\n?u1\n?x2\n\n=\n?u2\n?x1\n\n(4.19)\n\nui.ni = 0, i = 1, 2 (4.20)\n\nUsing the finite volume approach, this conditions are implemented specifying zero water fluxes\nand zero momentum diffusive fluxes for the cell faces in contact with land.\n\n4.4.4 Open boundaries\n\nThese boundaries are necessary to confine the domain to the study area. The information imposed\nthere must (or should) guarantee that what is happen outside the study area enter in order that the\nsolution inside the domain is not corrupted. Also, waves inside the domain should be allowed to go\nout. Perfect open boundary conditions does not exist, being the most suitable ones those depending\non the phenomena to be modelled. Review papers by Palma and Matano [1998, 2000] compare open\nboundary conditions in test cases. Some different boundary conditions were introduced in Mohid\n[Santos, 1995; Montero, 1999; Leita?o, 2003]. Flow relaxation schemes applied to several variables,\nlike temperature, salinity and velocities are also available [Leita?o, 2003].\n\n4.4.5 Moving boundaries\n\nMoving boundaries are closed boundaries whose positions change in time. These arises in domains\nwith intertidal areas where some points can be covered or uncovered depending on the tidal elevation.\nIn this case the uncovered cells must be tracked. The criterium used in Mohid is well described in\nMartins [2000], Martins et al. [2001], Leita?o [2003] and can be found in the assessment of Mohid-2D\nto the Ria de Aveiro chapter.\n\n4.5 Surface heat fluxes parameterizations\n\nEstuaries and costal lagoons are by nature highly subject to air-water interactive processes. The rela-\ntive shallowness of these areas result in a significant temporal variability (daily, monthly or seasonal)\nwhich may exceed that of open oceanic waters. Furthermore, the relative importance of the indi-\nvidual terms of the heat budget equation could be quite different. The water-air heat changes are\ninfluenced by five distinct processes: solar shortwave radiation, atmospheric longwave radiation, wa-\nter longwave radiation, sensible and latent heat flux. In Mohid, the total heat surface flux is obtained\nsumming the three last processes referred above. The solar end atmospheric radiation penetrating in\n\n\n\n4.5 Surface heat fluxes parameterizations 53\n\nthe water column are converted in heat. The radiation entering in the water column is parameterized\nas a exponential function of depth by the law proposed by Kraus [1972]:\n\nI(z) = Fsol\n(\nI1e\n?z/?1 + I2e\n\n?z/?2\n)\n, I2 = 1 ? I1 (4.21)\n\nIndices 1 and 2 refer to the long and shortwave radiation components, respectively. z is positive\ndownward, being z = 0 the sea surface. Values of I1, ?1 and ?2 where published by Paulson and\nSimpson [1977] according to the classification found in Jerlov [1968]. These coefficients depend on\nthe type of water of the study area.\n\nIn order to quantify the incoming solar radiation in the water surface, Mohid uses the formulation\n\nfound in Brock [1981] which depends on the sun height, atmospheric absorption and albedo. The\nformulation is given by:\n\nRs = (1 ? albedo) \u00d7 QS 0 \u00d7 AT \u00d7 neb (4.22)\n\nwhere Rs is the incoming solar radiation [Wm?2], QS 0 is the Solar Constant [Wm?2], AT is the\natmospheric transference, neb is the nebulosity (% of cloud cover). QS 0 varies with the latitude, time\nof the year and day hour.\n\nThe net longwave radiation Ra [Wm?2] is calculated using [Swinbank, 1963]:\n\nRa = 0.937 \u00d7 10?5?(273.15 + Ta)6(1 + 0.17neb2)(1 ? Re) (4.23)\n\nwhere ? is the Stefan-Boltzman constant (5.6697\u00d710?8 Wm?2K?4) and Re is the radiation reflected\nby the sea surface (%).\n\nThe infrared radiation Rbr [Wm?2] is calculated applying the Stefan-Boltzman law:\n\nRbr = ?\u00d7?\u00d7 (273.15 + Tw)4 (4.24)\n\nhere ? is the water emissivity (? 0.97) and Tw is the water temperature [K].\nThe latent HL and sensible Hs heat fluxes (in [Wm?2]) are calculated using the Dalton and Bowen\n\nlaws, respectively (adopted from [Chapra, 1997]):\n\nHL = (19.0 + 0.95U\n2\nw) \u00d7 (es,w ? rh \u00d7 es,a) (4.25)\n\nHs = Cb \u00d7 (19.0 + 0.95 \u00d7 U 2w) \u00d7 (Tw ? Ta) (4.26)\n\nwhere Uw is the wind speed [ms?1], es,w is the saturated water pressure [mmHg], rh is the relative\nhumidity [values between 0 and 1], es,a is the air saturation pressure [mmHg], Cb is the Bowen co-\nefficient [?0.47 mmHGK?1], Tw and Ta is the water and air temperature [K]. The latent heat flux is\ndirectly related to the pressure vapor deficit and the sensible heat is related to the water-air tempera-\n\nture difference.\n\n\n\n54 The numerical model\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nApplication of the Mohid-2D model to a\nmesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\n\nThe Ria de Aveiro is a mesotidal temperate complex shallow lagoon, located in the Northwest coast\n\nof the Iberian Peninsula. The assessment of the Mohid-2D model is performed through its calibration\n\nand validation for the Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The hydrodynamic model calibration was performed,\n\nadjusting the bottom friction coefficient, through the comparison between measured and computed\n\ntime series of sea surface elevation (SSE) for 24 stations within the lagoon. Harmonic analysis of\n\nthese data was performed in order to evaluate model\u2019s accuracy. For the M2 constituent, that has the\n\nmajor amplitude, the average phase difference of both amplitude and phase, for all 24 stations, is 3 cm\n\nand 3?, respectively. The model performance was also evaluated computing the RMS errors between\nmeasurements and computed values of SSE and current velocity. To validate the hydrodynamic model,\n\nmeasured and computed SSE and current velocity data were compared for 11 stations. In addition, it\n\nwas performed a comparison between water flow data (between the lagoon and the ocean) computed\n\nby the model and inferred from electric potential difference data obtained using a submarine electric\n\ncable crossing the entrance channel of the lagoon. A good calibration and validation was achieved\n\nrevealing that the model can reproduce the barotropic flows in such a complex system like Ria de\n\nAveiro.\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\nCoastal lagoons are saline water bodies separated or partially isolated from the sea. They may be\nlinked to the sea by one or more channels which are small relative to the lagoon. Ria de Aveiro is a\nvery complex system in terms of hydrodynamics and biogeochemical characteristics [Trancoso et al.,\n2005]. To understand its behavior it is necessary a prior knowledge of its physical processes. The\nmost important of these is hydrodynamics.\n\nNowadays, numerical models are used as sophisticated techniques of interpolation and extrapo-\nlation of field data in both spatial and temporal domains. On the other hand, realistic model results\n\n\n\n56 Application of the Mohid-2D model to a mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\n\ncannot be obtained without adequate supporting data [Cheng et al., 1991]. Thus, numerical and field\ndata are complementary elements of one integrated research program. Nowadays, two-dimensional\nvertically integrated (2DH) models can be considered as reliable tools for the study of shallow coastal\nwaters [Neves, 1985; Cheng et al., 1993; Inoue and Wiseman JR., 2000; Dias et al., 2003; Umgiesser\net al., 2003].\n\nA mathematical model can be considered as an approximate reconstruction of a real phenomenon.\nAll parameterizations and approximations used in the models lead to deviations of the model results\nfrom nature. It is an accepted requirement that a numerical model of estuarine hydrodynamics should\nbe verified, calibrated and validated before used in a practical application. However the procedures to\nperform these tasks are not widely accepted [Cheng et al., 1991]. Calibration and validation methods\nappear in several forms, depending on data availability, water body characteristics and researchers\nopinion [Hsu et al., 1999].\n\nIn the case of hydrodynamic modelling, the calibration is frequently made by qualitative com-\n\nparison of short time series of predicted and measured data for the same location and period of time\n[Cheng et al., 1993]. Another method used consists in comparing the harmonic constituents gener-\nated from predicted and observed data. In some studies, the harmonic constants are not considered\nas time independent [Smith, 1977], although authors like Cheng et al. [1993]; Martins et al. [2002]\nconsidered harmonic constants as an invariant characteristic of the astronomic tide. In the case of\nRia de Aveiro, Toma?s and Dias [2004] shown, in a long term analysis of the harmonic constants at\nthe lagoon\u2019s inlet, that meaningful changes are only observed in a scale of years. These changes may\nbe related to dredging operations performed at the inlet or natural changes in the lagoon\u2019s bed which\nproduces some hydrodynamic changes. Since harmonic constants can be considered independent of\ntime and if they are available, concurrent field data is not required for model calibration and valida-\ntion. This method has a major limitation since for its application a large amount of data is needed.\nTherefore, this method requires the use of a robust and efficient numerical model to generate long\ntime series.\n\nTo quantify the model performance it is commonly accepted to determine the Root Mean Square\nError (RMS) between model and field data [Hsu et al., 1999], as well as the relative mean absolute\nerror (RMAE) [Walstra et al., 2001; van Rijn et al., 2003]. One aspects to point out on using RMAE\nis that this error is less susceptibly to outliers. However, this evaluation method is mainly used to\nqualify wave heights and current velocity data [Walstra et al., 2001; van Rijn et al., 2003], and it\n\nwas not found any work presenting reference values to sea surface elevation (SSE). In this work the\nevaluation of the model will be performed through the use of RMS errors since this method could\nbe considered as a general method to evaluate the accuracy of numerical models reproducing any\nvariable.\n\nIn this work, the Mohid-2D model implementation for the Ria de Aveiro lagoon is presented,\ndescribing its assessment through calibration and validation against different sets of measured data.\nDue to the lagoon complex geometry and to the large number of calibration stations used, this goal\n\n\n\n5.2 The study area 57\n\nconstitutes a very challenge task. It is also purpose of this work to give a contribution to define a\ncomplete methodology to perform numerical models calibration and validation.\n\nThe model is calibrated using as a first approach a qualitative comparison of the temporal evo-\nlution of SSE data measured in 1987/1988 at several locations. When a good match is obtained for\nall the stations, the model\u2019s accuracy is evaluated through the determination of the RMS and also\nthrough the comparison between amplitude and phase of the main tidal constituents determined from\nharmonic analysis of the observed and computed data. The validation procedure is performed using\ntwo independent data sets, which include observations of current velocities and SSE values (1997\ndata) and measured water fluxes at the lagoon\u2019s inlet for the period of October 2002.\n\nOnce the hydrodynamic model is fully implemented and its results are considered reliable it will\nbe used to study the lagoon hydrodynamics and evaluate its evolution. A transport model is also being\ncoupled to the hydrodynamic model in order to study the thermohaline structure within the lagoon,\nwith a closer look to its central area, where occurs the mixing between fresh and salt water, and to\n\nthe study of water exchange between the lagoon and the near ocean.\n\n5.2 The study area\n\nRia de Aveiro is a shallow mesotidal lagoon located in the Northwest coast of Portugal (40?38\u2019N,\n8?44\u2019W). It has a very irregular geometry (see Figure 5.1) being characterized by narrow channels and\nby the existence of intertidal areas, namely mud flats and salt marshes. The lagoon has a maximum\nwidth and length of 10 and 45 km, respectively. In spring tide covers an area of 83 km2 at high tide\nreducing to 66 km2 at low tide [Dias et al., 2000]. The averaged depth of the lagoon is 1 m, except\nin its navigation channels where dredging operations are often carried out. One single inlet at the\nwestern boundary allows the water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and the lagoon. This inlet\nhas about 20 m deep, 1.3 km long and 350 m wide.\n\nRia de Aveiro receives freshwater mainly from two rivers, the Antua? (5 m3s?1 average flow)\nand the Vouga (50 m3s?1 average flow) [Moreira et al., 1993; Dias et al., 1999]. Vouga River is\nresponsible by approximately 2/3 of the freshwater input into the lagoon [Dias et al., 1999]. The\nother rivers have negligible flow, except the freshwater source in the south end of the Mira channel,\nwhich consists of a small system of ponds and rivers that have a flow which is not well known.\nTides, which are semidiurnal, are the main forcing of circulation in the lagoon and conjugated with\nfreshwater inflow they controls the water mass dynamics inside Ria de Aveiro. The minimum tidal\n\nrange at the lagoon\u2019s mouth was referred as 0.6 m (neap tides) and the maximum tidal range as 3.2\nm (spring tides) [Dias et al., 1999]. Extreme conditions of wind (values higher than 20 kmh?1) may\ninduce particular circulation patterns, mainly in shallow areas and wide channels [Dias, 2001].\n\nThe estimated tidal prism of the lagoon is 136.7\u00d7106 m3 for maximum spring tide and 34.9\u00d7106\nm3 for maximum neap tide [Dias, 2001]. The total estimated freshwater input is very small (about\n1.8\u00d7106 m3 during a tidal cycle) [Moreira et al., 1993] when compared with the mean tidal prism at\n\n\n\n58 Application of the Mohid-2D model to a mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\n\n40\u00ba50'\n\n45'\n\n40'\n\n35'\n\n8\u00ba45' 40'\n\n-2.7\n\n2.7\n\n8.2\n\n13.6\n\n19.7\n\n24.6\n\n30.0\n\nD\ne\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n] \nre\n\nla\nte\n\nd\n t\n\no\n t\n\nh\ne\n l\n\no\nc\na\nl \n\nd\na\ntu\n\nm\n\n0 200\nkm\n\nSpain\n\nMira\nBoco River\n\nM\nir\n\na\n C\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\n\u00cdl\nh\na\nv\no\n C\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\nEs\npi\n\nnh\nei\n\nro\n\n  C\nha\n\nnn\nel\n\nVouga River\n\nA\nn\ntu\n\n\u00e3\n R\n\niv\ne\nr\n\nS\n. \nJa\n\nc\nin\n\nto\n C\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\nA\ntl\n\na\nn\nti\n\nc\n O\n\nc\ne\na\nn\n\nLaranjo\n\nCaster\nRiver\n\nG\no\nn\nd\ne\n\nR\niv\n\ne\nr\n\nAveiro\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nZ\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\nK\n\nL\n\nN\n\nM, Q\n\nR\n\nS T\n\nO\n\nP\n\nU\n\nW\n\nV\n\nX\n\nY\n\nA - Barra\nB - Costa Nova\nC - Vagueira\nD - S.

However, after important rainfall the stratification becomes\nimportant near the freshwater inflow locations [Dias et al., 1999].\n\n5.3 The numerical model\n\nThe numerical model used in this study is Mohid, originally developed by the MARETEC - Marine\nand Environmental Technology Center group of the Instituto Superior Te?cnico [Martins et al., 1998,\n\n\n\n5.3 The numerical model 59\n\n2001]. This model was previously used successfully to simulate coastal and estuarine flows in several\nestuarine and coastal environments [Cancino and Neves, 1999; Martins et al., 2001; Neves et al.,\n1998; Coelho et al., 2001]. Mohid is a three-dimensional finite volume model with the ability to\nsimulate flows in well and partially mixed systems. Due to the Ria de Aveiro characteristics it was\nconsidered the use of Mohid in a horizontal two-dimensional (depth integrated) mode as the right\nchoice to simulate the lagoon\u2019s hydrodynamic.\n\n5.3.1 The governing equations\n\nThe model solves the three-dimensional incompressible primitive equations. Hydrostatic equilibrium\nis assumed as well as Boussinesq approximation. The momentum and mass balance equations are:\n\n?ui\n?t\n\n+\n?(uiu j)\n?x j\n\n= ? 1\n?0\n\n?patm\n?xi\n\n? g?(?)\n?0\n\n??\n\n?xi\n? g\n?0\n\n? ?\nx3\n\n???\n\n?xi\nd x3\n\n+\n?\n\n?x j\n(?\n?ui\n?x j\n\n) ? 2?i jk? juk (5.1)\n\n?u1\n?x1\n\n+\n?u2\n?x2\n\n+\n?u3\n?x3\n\n= 0 (5.2)\n\nThe horizontal velocity components are calculated using Equation 5.1, where ui are the velocity\nvector components in the horizontal cartesian xi directions (i = 1, 2), u j are the velocity vector\ncomponents in the three cartesian directions x j ( j = 1, 2, 3), ? is the turbulent viscosity and patm is\nthe atmospheric pressure. ? is the specific mass, ?? is its anomaly, ?0 is the reference specific mass,\n?(?) represents the specific mass at the free surface, g is the acceleration of gravity, t is the time, ? is\nthe Earth\u2019s velocity of rotation and ? is the alternate tensor.\n\nIf the Continuity Equation (5.2) is integrated over the whole water column (between the free\nsurface elevation ?(x, y) and the bottom ?h, the free surface equation is obtained:\n\n??\n\n?t\n= ? ?\n\n?x1\n\n? ?\n?h\n\nu1d x3 ?\n?\n\n?x2\n\n? ?\n?h\n\nu2d x3 (5.3)\n\nwhere h is the depth. The hydrostatic approximation gives:\n\np(z) = patm + ?0g(?? z) + g\n? ?\n\nz\n??dz (5.4)\n\nEquation (5.4) relates pressure at any depth with the atmospheric pressure at the sea surface, the sea\nlevel and the pressure anomaly integrated between that level and the surface.\n\nThe bottom shear stress, ~?, is represented as a quadratic function of velocity using the formulation\nproposed by Antoine Che?zy [Dronkers, 1964] where ~? is proportional to the square velocity (5)\nand the drag coefficient (CD) can be parameterized in terms of Manning friction coefficient (n), by\napplying Equation (5.6):\n\n\n\n60 Application of the Mohid-2D model to a mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\n\n~? = CD|~V|V (5.5)\n\nCD = gn\n2 H1/3 (5.6)\n\nwhere ~V is the horizontal velocity vector and H (H = h + ?) is the depth of the water column.\n\nThe model discretization is fully described in Martins et al. [2001].\n\n5.3.2 Boundary conditions\n\nSeveral types of boundaries were used in this application: free surface, bottom, lateral closed bound-\nary, lateral opened boundary and moving boundary.\n\nAt the ocean open boundary the free surface elevation is specified and at the river boundaries the\nwater flow is imposed. The lateral boundary condition at coastal boundaries is a free slip condition,\nimposed by specifying a zero normal component of mass and momentum diffusive fluxes at cell\nfaces in contact with land. No mass fluxes at the surface and bottom were considered. Moving\n\nboundaries are closed boundaries whose position varies with time. This situation appears in domains\nwith intertidal zones that are very common in Ria de Aveiro. In this case the uncovered cells must\nbe tracked and with this purpose a criterion based in Figure 5.2 is used. H MI N is the depth bellow\nwhich the cell is considered uncovered. In this case a thin volume of water above the uncovered\ncell is conserved. The cells of position i, j are considered uncovered when one of the two following\nsituations is true:\n\nHi j &lt;H MI N ??i j?1 &lt;?hi j + H MI N (5.7)\n\nHi j?1 &lt;H MI N ??i j &lt;?hi j?1 + H MI N (5.8)\n\nFigure 5.2: Conditions for a point to be considered uncovered (moving boundaries).\n\nThe second condition of (5.7) assures that the cell is not being covered by the tidal wave propa-\ngating from left to right and the second condition of (5.8) assures that the cell is not being covered\nby the tidal wave propagating from right to left. The noise formed by the abrupt change in velocity at\nthe dry cells is controlled with a careful choice of H MI N (in this case H MI N = 0.10 m) [Leendertse\nand Liu, 1978].\n\n\n\n5.4 Application to the Ria de Aveiro 61\n\n5.4 Application to the Ria de Aveiro\n\nBathymetry is probably the most important among many factors that affects the flow in shallow sys-\ntems like Ria de Aveiro. The bathymetry controls the spatial variability of the current magnitude and\ndirection, constituting a factor which assures the realism of the numerical model. The numerical grid\nmust be sufficiently refined to resolve all the variations of depth and geometry, but as the grid reso-\nlution is refined the total number of grid points and the computation time increase excessively. Due\nto the lagoon complex geometry a grid with variable spatial step was developed. This grid has 429\nby 568 cells, with dimensions of 40 by 40 meters in the central area of the lagoon (between 40?38\u2019\nand 40?41\u2019 and 8?35\u2019 and 8?45\u2019) (Figure 5.1) and 40 by 100 meters in the north and south areas of\nthe lagoon. The numerical bathymetry used in this study was developed from data concerning depth\nobtained from a general survey carried out in 1987/88 by the Hydrographic Institute of Portuguese\nNavy (IH). More recent bathymetric data is also available. In fact, recent dredging operations per-\nformed in 1998 in Mira and S. Jacinto channels and in 2002 close to the mouth of the lagoon supplied\nnew bathymetric data that was used to actualize the numerical bathymetry. For these regions the\noriginal values of water depth were replaced by the recent ones. The water depth at each grid point\nwas determined from the water volume of the cell, calculated using a Monte Carlo cubature method\n[Dias, 2001].\n\nAt the sea open boundary, located ?5200 m westward station A, the free surface elevation was\nspecified from 38 tidal constituents obtained after harmonic analysis [Pawlowicz et al., 2002] of data\nmeasured at a tide gauge located close to the mouth of the lagoon (40?38\u2019N and 8?44\u2019W - station\nA). The tide was imposed in the ocean open boundary with a phase and amplitude correction factor\nfor the major harmonic constants in a way that the model results reproduce the tidal elevation at the\nmouth tidal gauge.\n\n5.5 Hydrodynamic model calibration\n\nA number of tests were carried out to evaluate the hydrodynamic model sensitivity to changes in the\nparameters, such as time step, initial water level and horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient.The values\nadopted in this study were time step (?t) of 10 s and horizontal eddy viscosity (?) of 5 m2s?1. Initial\nconditions for the hydrodynamic model are null free surface elevation and null velocity in all grid\npoints. These variables become independent on the initial conditions in all the computational domain\nafter 48 hours of simulation (?4 tidal cycles). The model was spun up from rest over 2 days in order\nto guarantee the stability and independence from the initial conditions of the results.\n\nThe model calibration is defined as an operation in which specific values, or distributions, or a\nrange of variation are given to the floating free model parameters, so that the model results fit best\nto a set of field observations [Koutitas, 1994]. The model calibration is subsequently based on the\n\ndetermination and the adjustment of the parameters to which the model is most sensitive.\nThe calibration of the hydrodynamic model was carried out comparing model results with values\n\n\n\n62 Application of the Mohid-2D model to a mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\n\nof SSE measured in the years of 1987/1988 at 24 stations covering the entire area of the lagoon\n(Figure 5.1) [IH, 1991]. From the SSE observations data it is concluded that there is tidal energy\ndamping, due to friction, as the tidal wave propagates from the mouth of the lagoon towards the\nend of the channels. This behavior is common in estuarine ecosystems [Hsu et al., 1999] and was\nanalyzed, in the case of Ria de Aveiro, by Dias and Fernandes [2006]. The magnitude of the bottom\nfriction coefficient determines changes in the tidal wave propagation within the lagoon. Therefore, the\nmodel parameter subjected to adjustments in the calibration process is the Manning bottom friction\ncoefficient (n) (eq. 5.6).\n\nIn this study the procedure adopted to calibrate the model consisted in spatially varying the bot-\ntom roughness coefficient, by assigning Manning\u2019s values to specific regions of the numerical do-\nmain. This procedure was successfully tested by Smith and Cheng [1987] and Cheng et al. [1993]\nin numerical studies performed at Suisun and S. Francisco Bay areas, California. The model results\nare not, usually, very sensitive to the absolute values of n. However, it is known that the water depth\n\nstrongly influences the bottom stress. This \u201dinfluence\u201d is introduced into the calculations by allowing\nManning\u2019s coefficient values to vary as a function of water depth. Therefore, the introduction of this\nparameter is necessary to achieve a better reproduction of the observed data. It can be affirmed that\nthe bottom friction should change according to the nature of the bed [Aldridge and Davies, 1993] and\nthat an increase in the bottom friction will produce a decrease in the tidal wave in that zone of the\nchannel and in the channel\u2019s upstream. Other assumption is that an increase in the bottom roughness\nwill produce an increase in the phase lag for high tide and decrease for low tide [Fry and Aubrey,\n1990].\n\nUsing these guiding principles the Manning coefficient was adjusted locally until the model re-\nsults fits satisfactorily with the measurements. In the case of this study the best adjustment between\nmodel results and field observations was achieved through bottom roughness parameterized from\nManning coefficients ranging between 0.022 and 0.045.\n\n5.5.1 Results\n\nFigure 5.3 shows the comparison between the computed and observed SSE time series for nine of the\nstations used in the model calibration (this procedure involved 24 stations).

At station A the agreement between\ncomputed and observed data should be perfect, however this is not the case. In fact, a RMS error of\n?4 cm was found for the station located at the lagoon mouth. This difference represents less than 2%\nof the mean tidal range near the mouth of the lagoon and may be justified by an inaccurate phase and\namplitude correction factor for the major tidal constituents imposed at the open ocean boundary. This\nsmall error may partially explain the errors found in the other stations. In general the disagreement\nbetween computed and observed SSE is low with values lower than 5% of the local tidal range. The\nhighest disagreement was found for stations P, T and U, with RMS errors around 10% of the tidal\nrange. The errors occurred at station P and U (RMS = 0.243 m and RMS = 0.218 m, respectively) are\ndifficult to explain, they are probably due to an integrated effect of bathymetry errors in terms of the\nwater volume arrested in the tidal flats during the flood. However, it was not possible to improve the\nagreement between computed and observed data in these stations adjusting the Manning coefficient.\nAt station T a RMS error of 0.234 m was computed. This difference between the computed and\nmeasured values may be due to several factors, such as the distance to the lagoon mouth (?12 km),\nthe fact that this station is placed close to the Vouga River mouth or the small width and depth of the\nchannel (?40 m and ?2 m, respectively). At the end of I?lhavo channel (stations X and Y) the RMS\nerror is about 7% of the local tidal range. These disagreements may be explained by some inaccurate\ndefinitions of the bathymetry at those areas. In fact, at I?lhavo channel there is a very narrow section,\nwith a width of about 10 m, where strong currents occur. This region is very difficult to represent in\n\n\n\n64 Application of the Mohid-2D model to a mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\n\nthe numerical bathymetry, even with cells of 40 m wide. Therefore it is difficult to improve the model\nresults in this channel without increasing to much the computational effort.\n\nThe importance of the proper simulation of the times for high and low tide in the modelling of\ntidal flows inside domains with large intertidal areas such as Ria de Aveiro, was demonstrated by Kuo\nand Park [1985]. In fact, if the side storage area is not properly taken into account, the model can\nreproduce the mean tidal range but the phase cannot be properly computed. The analysis of Figure\n5.3 shows that the time lag between computed and observed data is very low for both high and low\ntide in almost all the stations. In this study the time lag is quantified through harmonic analysis.\n\nHarmonic analysis [Pawlowicz et al., 2002] was performed on one month length time series for\nboth observed and computed SSE for all the stations. Results for the three major semi-diurnal tidal\nconstituents (M2 - 12.42 h; S 2 - 12 h; N2 - 12.9 h) determined for all the stations are presented in\nFigure 5.4 and reveal a rather good agreement both in amplitude and phase for these constituents\n(which represents ?90% of the tidal energy in Ria de Aveiro [Dias et al., 1999]).\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nAm\npl\n\nitu\nde\n\n [m\n]\n\nM\n2\n\nS\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nAm\npl\n\nitu\nde\n\n [m\n]\n\nN\n2\n\nAB CDE FGH I J K LMNOPQR S T UVXY\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nPh\nas\n\ne \n[\u00ba\n\n]\n\nM\n2\n\nAB CDE FGH I J K LMNOPQR S T UVXY\n\nStation\n\nS\n2\n\nAB CDE FGH I J K LMNOPQR S T UVXY\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nPh\nas\n\ne \n[\u00ba\n\n]\n\nN\n2\n\nFigure 5.4: Comparison between amplitude and phase of the three major semi-diurnal tidal con-\nstituents (M2, S 2, N2) determined in all stations used in the calibration procedure (solid line: mea-\nsurements; thick solid line: model).\n\nFor the M2 constituent, which has the major amplitude, the mean difference of the amplitudes is\nabout 3 cm and the standard deviation is ?7 cm. The mean phase difference for all the 24 stations is\nabout 3? and the standard deviation is ?6?. One error of 1? corresponds to about 2 minutes departure\nin the arrival of high tide for a semi-diurnal constituent, which means that the average difference\nbetween field and model data is about 6 minutes for the M2. Results for the other semi-diurnal\nconstituents as well for the diurnal ones (not shown), are not so accurate as for the M2 constituent.\nHowever, they reveal a good agreement between the computed and observed constants.

The measurements used to perform the validation have\nto be independent from the data set used for calibration.\n\nConsidering that in this work the model calibration was performed through comparison of har-\nmonic constants of model results and field data, the model validation may not be relevant if the\nharmonic constants are considered independent of time. However, the data set used in the calibration\nprocess of this model is from 1987/1988, and according to Toma?s and Dias [2004] in a large temporal\nscale the harmonic constants have slightly change at the lagoon inlet. Also considering that Ria de\n\nAveiro is a very dynamic system in terms of its morphology, the validation of the model using a more\nrecent data set is considered fundamental.\n\nTaking into account the availability of recent field data two different periods were simulated\nto validate the model. The first simulation corresponds to a period during June 1997 where the\nmodel performance was evaluated by comparing the RMS error between computed and observed\ndata of SSE and of current velocity for eleven and ten stations, respectively, distributed along the\nmain channels of the lagoon.\n\nThe second simulation corresponds to a period during October 2002. In this case computed and\nobserved data of the water fluxes between the lagoon and the ocean in a monthly time scale were\ncompared. In the case of Ria de Aveiro, this comparison is particularly relevant, since the lagoon\nhas a single inlet that allows the water exchange with the ocean. The observed water fluxes were\ndetermined using measurements of electrical potential difference between the shores as described in\nNolasco et al. [2006].\n\n5.6.1 Results\n\nThe validation procedure was carried out without changing the friction coefficients used during the\ncalibration. In the ocean open boundary the tide synthesized for the considered period of measure-\nments was imposed considering the same correction factor referred in Section 5.4. The remaining\ninputs were left unchanged.\n\nWhen comparing current velocity values it is important to remember that this variable varies\nrapidly in space, both in magnitude and direction, from point to point. This behavior reflects the\nirregular geometry of the region and it produces higher discrepancies between field and computed\nresults. Moreover, the model results are related to the mean value over the vertical and over the\n\n\n\n66 Application of the Mohid-2D model to a mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\n\nhorizontal spatial domain corresponding to the grid size, while the field data corresponds to a single\npoint or, at best, an average over various points.\n\nConsidering that most of the lagoon\u2019s channels are aligned through a main direction, in order\nto compare the velocities the main flow directions were found for both measured and computed\nvelocities at each station. These directions resulted almost coincident and the computed and measured\ncurrent velocities were projected along these directions.\n\nFigures 5.5 and 5.6 show the comparison between the computed and measured SSE and along\nflow direction velocities, respectively.

As in the calibration procedure, the results for the far end of I?lhavo Channel are\nnot so accurate, due to very narrow channel areas where the currents are to high. Except for these\nstations the agreement between values is rather good, revealing that a general agreement was achieved\nbetween computed and measured SSE.\n\nFrom Figure 5.6 it is verified that there are discrepancies between the model and the field data\nwhen assessing velocities point by point. The RMS errors are very high, ranging from about 6% of\nthe current amplitude in the case of the better adjustment (station D) to more than 50% for the worse\ncase (station F). At stations B, C and D (near the lagoon\u2019s mouth), the phase errors are lower than\n10 minutes, revealing a good reproduction of the observations.

The comparison is rather good for stations B,\n\nC and D. These stations are located at the center of wide channels and therefore it can be considered\nthat the measured velocities are representative of the current speed in an area correspondent to a grid\ncell. For all the other stations, except stations V and X, the phase may be considered well reproduced.\nThese two stations are located at the end of I?lhavo channel, which is characterized by very narrow\nareas that are not well resolved by a model using grid cells 40 meters wide.\n\nThe hydrodynamic model was also validated by comparing water flow data inferred through the\nuse of MIV technique and computed by the model. The tidal evolution in the Ria de Aveiro is\nessentially determined by the lunar constituents. They represent more than 90% of the tidal energy.\nTherefore, only the observed and computed water flow induced by the lunar constituents (M2 and O1)\nand by M4 (essentially generated inside the lagoon) will be compared.\n\nFigure 5.7 shows the water flow induced by the referred constituents for both MIV (5.7A) and\ncomputed values (5.7B). The spectral analysis results of these time series are presented in Figure\n5.8A and 5.8B, respectively. The higher energy peaks correspond to M2, the major tidal constituent\nin the Ria de Aveiro, but M4 and O1 are also present in the spectra of MIV and model results. The\ndirect comparison (for a short period) between the water flow computed by the model and obtained\nfrom MIV measurements is shown in Figure 5.9. The agreement between the two series is rather\ngood.\n\n\n\n68 Application of the Mohid-2D model to a mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\n\n?10000\n\n?5000\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\nW\n\nat\ner\n\n fl\now\n\n [m\n3 s\n\n?1\n]\n\n(A)\n\nMIV\n\n274 278 282 286 290 294 298 302\n?10000\n\n?5000\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\nJulian day\n\n(B)\n\nW\nat\n\ner\n fl\n\now\n [m\n\n3 s\n?1\n\n]\n\nModel\n\nFigure 5.7: Tidal lunar water flow measured by the MIV technique (A) and computed by the hydro-\ndynamic model (B).\n\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nA\nm\n\npl\nitu\n\nde\n [m\n\n3 s\n?1\n\n]\n\nFrequency [cpd]\n\n1 23 1 ?

The validation also showed the ability of\nthis hydrodynamic model to reproduces different sets of data in independent new conditions.\n\nHowever, differences between model and field data exist. These differences are due to several\nfactors, such as an inaccurate definition of the bathymetry for some particular regions of the domain,\nvery narrow channels that are not well resolved by the horizontal grid and some uncertainties in the\nfield data.\n\nThe results reveal that Mohid can accurately reproduce the barotropic flows in Ria de Aveiro, and\ntherefore be considered as a valuable tool for future hydrodynamic and transport mstudies within the\nlagoon.\n\nThe procedures described here takes modelers through the basic steps on the implementation of\nhydrodynamic models. Moreover, this work pretend to present general and simple methods which\nmay be used in the calibration and validation of these models by researchers or consultant profes-\n\nsionals.\n\n\n\n70 Application of the Mohid-2D model to a mesotidal temperate coastal lagoon\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nCalibration and validation of the\ntransport model\n\n6.1 Introduction\n\nAs a natural tracer, salinity is used for the calibration of mixing processes within estuarine areas where\na significant freshwater discharge exists. In these systems, mixing processes are mainly driven by the\nfreshwater discharge and by the barotropic and baroclinic components of the pressure gradient due to\ntides and longitudinal salinity, respectively [Miranda and Castro Filho, 1996]. Therefore, the salinity\ndistributions reflect the interaction effects between these processes. Assuming that the barotropic\nflows (tidal flows) have been calibrated and validated (see Chapter 5), the procedure used to calibrate\n\nthe salt transport model is to compare measured and computed salinity time series. Once the transport\nmodel is considered calibrated, the mixing processes inside the channel may be considered well\nrepresented by the numerical model. On the other hand, the heat transport model calibration is only\nrelated to the heat and radiative fluxes parameterizations (Section 4.5 in Chapter 4). In the next\nsection, a simple sensitivity analysis is presented on how heat surface fluxes (exchanges between\nthe water and the atmosphere) influences the water temperature patterns within Ria de Aveiro. In\nthis chapter the results of the the transport model calibration and validation are presented. Due to\nthe structure of this dissertation, further details about the transport model equations and heat fluxes\nparameterizations are described in Chapter 4. Details about the implementation of the transport model\nare presented in Chapter 7.\n\n6.2 On the influence of heat surface fluxes in the lagoon\u2019s water tem-\nperature horizontal patterns\n\nIn shallow systems as the Ria de Aveiro, the horizontal patterns of water temperature is strongly\ninfluenced by the exchanges between the water and the atmosphere (see Figure 6.1 for reference).\n\n\n\n72 Calibration and validation of the transport model\n\nThese patterns adjust dynamically to different sea and fluvial water temperature conditions, and also\nto meteorological forcing. In order to illustrate how the meteorological forcing affects the water\ntemperature a simple test was carried out: two model simulations were performed using the same\noceanic and landward boundary conditions, in one, surface heat fluxes were imposed (simulation 2)\nand, in the other, no heat fluxes were imposed (simulation 1).\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00ba5\n0\n\n'\n\n4\n5\n\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n3\n5\n\n'\n\n8\n\u00ba4\n\n4\n'\n\n4\n0\n\n'\n\n15.0\n\n17.5\n\n20.0\n\n22.5\n\n25.0\n\n27.5\n\n30.0\nInitial conditions\n\nL\now\n\n W\nater (LW\n\n)\nLW\n\n + 3 tidal cycles\nLW\n\n + 6 tidal cycles\nLW\n\n + 9 tidal cycles\nLW\n\n + 12 tidal cycles\n\nFigure 6.1: Ria de Aveiro water temperature horizontal structure without meteorological forcing (top\nrow) and with meteorological forcing (bottom row). The water temperature units are ?C.\n\n\n\n6.3 Calibration of salt and heat transport models 73\n\nAt the open ocean boundary, the model was forced with tides and a water temperature constant\nvalue of 15?C (on both simulations) and, at the landward boundaries, different river flow and water\ntemperature constant values were imposed: Vouga River - 20 m3s?1 and 18?C; Antua? River and Mira\nRiver - 9 m3s?1 and 18 and 20?C, respectively; rivers Boco, Caster and Gonde - 5, 7 and 6 m3s?1,\nrespectively and 20?C. At the surface meteorological data, concurrent with the simulation periods (10\nto 17 July 1996), from the NCEP database (nearest grid point: 40.952?N, -9.375?W), were imposed\n(simulation 2).\n\nIn Figure 6.1 are depicted the results for both simulations. At the top panel, are shown the water\ntemperature horizontal patterns for the simulation where no heat fluxes were imposed. The bottom\npanel shows the water temperature patterns affected by heat fluxes.\n\nWhen no heat fluxes are imposed (top row), the water temperature patterns are only determined by\nsea and fluvial water temperature. The rivers play a key role on the establishment of the temperature\npattern at the north and south areas of the lagoon within its area of influence. The major changes\n\nin the temperature horizontal patterns are visible after 12 tidal cycles, when the rivers extend their\ninfluence at the north and south areas of the lagoon with water temperatures of ?20?C. At this time,\nthe water temperature in the central area of the lagoon presents values of ?17?C, which are also\nvisible in the near ocean. When meteorological forcing is used (bottom row), the water temperature\nstructure changes after three tidal cycles, presenting values rounding 20?C within the lagoon. After\n9 tidal cycles, the temperature structure is completely different with an increase of about 5?C in the\nshallow areas of the lagoon. After 12 tidal cycles, the water temperature within the lagoon present a\nmaximum of ?28?C in the shallow areas of the lagoon and an increase of ?1-1.5?C near the lagoon\u2019s\nmouth in the navigation channel (deepest area).\n\nIn spite of the tidal and river flow influence on the water temperature horizontal structure, these\nresults reveal the influence of variables like air temperature, relative humidity or incoming solar\nradiation in the shallow regions of the lagoon. Thus, in order to achieve a good implementation of\nheat transport models, it is necessary not only an accurate prescription of sea and river boundary\nconditions, but also the use of meteorological data for the model\u2019s implementation.\n\n6.3 Calibration of salt and heat transport models\n\nA set of salinity and water temperature data measured between 09/07/1996 and 28/07/1996 is avail-\n\nable for comparison with model results. The data include long time series of salinity and water\ntemperature measured near the lagoon\u2019s mouth. It also include 25 hours time series of hourly data\nmeasured at 7 different stations distributed along the lagoon channels (see Figure 7.1 in Section 7.2).\nThese data were measured after a long dry period, a typical Summer season situation, where the\nfreshwater inputs are expected to be low.\n\nAt the sea open boundary was specified salinity and water temperature time series (Figure 6.2).\nThe freshwater discharge imposed at the upstream boundaries are not known, and in this study they\nare used as a calibration parameter. The values used were: Vouga river - 2 m3s?1; Antua? river - 0.5\n\n\n\n74 Calibration and validation of the transport model\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n35.6\n\n35.8\n\n36\n\n36.2\n\n36.4\n\n36.6\n\n36.8\n\n37\n\n37.2\n\n37.4\n\nTime [Days]\n\nSa\nlin\n\nity\n [p\n\nsu]\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\nTime [Days]\n\nTe\nmp\n\nera\ntur\n\ne [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\nFigure 6.2: Time series of salinity and water temperature measured at the lagoon\u2019s mouth, and used\nas boundary conditions for the sea open boundary\n\nm3s?1; Boco river - 2 m3s?1; Valas do Mira - 2 m3s?1; Caster and Gonde rivers - 0.5 m3s?1. The\nfreshwater salinity values were specified as 0 psu, and a river\u2019s water temperature of 18 ?C (Vouga\nriver), 23 ?C (Antua? River), 18 ?C (Boco and Mira rivers) and 25 ?C (Caster and Gonde rivers). In\nthe calibration of the heat transport model it was imposed meteorological data (relative humidity,\nair temperature incoming solar radiation, wind modulus and direction), from the NCEP\u2019s data base,\nconcurrent with the simulation periods. The initial conditions for the transport model are salinity and\nwater temperature fields obtained by interpolation of typical values for each simulation period (see\n\nFigures 6.3a and 6.3b), because the time to dynamic equilibrium for these variables is much longer\nthan for tides or tidal currents.

The Root\nMean Square Error (RMS) values were computed for all the stations and are displayed in each plot.\n\nIn general, a good agreement between computed and observed salinity data is achieved, revealing\na good representation of the salinity time evolution and amplitude variation. The RMS values are\nabout 5% of the mean salinity value (during two tidal cycles) for all stations, except at station V\nwhere the RMS value is 2.730 (? 10% of the mean salinity value). At this point it is observed a delay\nof about 1.5 hours between computed and observed salinity values. Except at station B where the\ndifference between computed and observed values is lower than 1 psu (during high water), the model\nseems to underpredict the salinity value with differences of about 2 psu during high water.\n\nThe comparison between predicted and observed water temperature values is depicted in Figure\n6.5. It was achieved a good agreement between computed and observed water temperature values\nfor all the stations. The lowest disagreement is obtained at station B, with a RMS of 0.998 between\n\ncomputed and observed time series. This value is about 5% of the mean water temperature value.\nAt the other stations the RMS values oscillate between 10 and 15% of the mean water temperature\nvalue. From the figure, it can be seen that the model reproduces well the temporal evolution and\nunderestimates the the amplitude variation, except at station D. During the low tide the maximum\ndifferences are reached (1-3?). These discrepancies may be due to errors when imposing the river\nwater temperature values at the upstream boundaries.

Another reason that could affect the model\nresults could be related to cloud cover variations (a constant value was imposed, representing the\n\nmean value during the simulation periods), which affect the radiation absorbed by the water, and\nhence the water temperature.\n\nDespite these factors, according to the results presented, it may be considered that the mixing\nprocesses are well reproduced by the model, and the water temperature distributions may also be\nconsidered well resolved by the numerical model.\n\n6.4 Validation of the salt and heat transport models\n\nThe transport models were validated through the comparison of model results with an independent\nfield data set. As in the validation of the hydrodynamic model (see Chapter 5) the salinity and\nwater temperature values measured during June 1997 at 11 stations throughout the lagoon are used.\nThese stations are presented in Figure 7.1 in Section 7.2. These data correspond to a wet period in\nwhich higher river runoffs than during the period used for the calibration are expected.

The salinity results\nreveal that the model reproduces well the temporal evolution and the amplitude variation of the salin-\nity, except for the stations M, V, X and Y where the amplitude variation is not well reproduced. The\nRMS errors ranged from 10 to 25% of the mean salinity value (obtained during one tidal cycle). The\nbest results are obtained at stations F, H and U with values lower than 10% of the mean salinity value.\nStation M, V, X and Y results reveal that the model reproduces well the salinity temporal variation\nbut not its amplitude variation. The RMS values are higher than 25% of the mean salinity value.\nThese stations are located near the far end of Mira and I?lhavo channels, near freshwater sources,\nbeing strongly influenced by the boundary conditions that were chosen (freshwater discharge and\nfreshwater salinity and water temperature values). The results at station Z reflect the river runoff that\n\nwere imposed (5 m3s?1) with values close to the freshwater ones (0 psu). The river runoff imposed at\nBoco river (1 m3s?1) is very low and does not affect the salinity signal at stations V, X and Y.\n\nThe water temperature results reveal that the model reproduces well the temporal evolution of\nthe water temperature but reveal some discrepancies in the amplitude variation. The RMS error\nvalues are lower than 10% of the mean water temperature value, except at stations V, X, Y and Z.\nIn these stations, the discrepancy between computed and observed values may be explained by the\n\n\n\n6.5 Conclusions 79\n\n20 25 30\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\nT\n\nem\npe\n\nra\ntu\n\nre\n [\n\n\u00baC\n] B\n\nRMS = 0.79520/06/97\n\n10 15 20\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n] C\n\nRMS = 0.59822/06/97\n\n5 10 15\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n] E\n\nRMS = 0.65618/06/97\n\n0 5 10 15\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n] F\n\nRMS = 0.31720/06/97\n\n10 15 20\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n] H\n\nRMS = 0.86819/06/97\n\n15 20 25\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\nM\n\nRMS = 0.63717/06/97\n\n10 15 20\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\nU\n\nRMS = 0.64405/06/97\n\n10 15 20\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\nT\n\nem\npe\n\nra\ntu\n\nre\n [\n\n\u00baC\n] V\n\nRMS = 1.75107/06/97\n\n10 15 20\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n] X\n\nRMS = 0.66610/06/97\n\nTime [Hours]\n\n10 15 20\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n] Y\n\nRMS = 2.23411/06/97\n\nTime [Hours]\n10 15 20\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n] Z\n\nRMS = 1.04323/06/97\n\nTime [Hours]\n\nFigure 6.9: Comparison of water temperature time series for the stations used during the validation\nprocedure.

At stations X, Y and Z\nthe water temperature signal does not reflect the tidal variation at these locations. Instead, the results\nreflect a diurnal signal, i. e. the water temperature follows the air temperature temporal evolution\nwith increasing between 8:00 h and 15:00 h and then decreasing until the end of the day. This may\nbe explained by the morphological characteristics of the channels, which are very narrow and very\nshallow increasing the importance of the meteorological input.\n\nHowever, from these results the salt and heat transport models may be considered validated,\nreproducing well the salinity and heat transfer processes in Ria de Aveiro.\n\n6.5 Conclusions\n\nThe model used in this study - Mohid - seem to make use of an accurate bathymetry. In general, the\nhorizontal grid resolves well the transport processes. The discrepancies revealed may be due to some\nuncertainties of the field data or the inadequacy in the use of a 2D depth-average model. In fact, as\nDias [2001] pointed out, the field data used to calibrate and validate the transport models have some\nuncertainties related to the accuracy and resolution of the measuring instruments that were used, as\n\nwell as with instruments failures and incorrect measuring procedures. The first are normally ? 0.1%\n\n\n\n80 Calibration and validation of the transport model\n\nof the observed data and therefore may be neglected. The others may lead to large uncertainties and\nare very difficult to quantify. Therefore, a good quality of the field data should be guaranteed in order\nto achieve good model results.\n\nRunning a 2D depth-integrated model may be enough for studies of tidal time scale processes\nin a coastal lagoon like Ria de Aveiro. However, in deeper regions, such as the region from the\nmouth of the lagoon to the end of the Espinheiro channel, where stratification occurs, large vertical\nvelocity shear is expected and a simple quadratic formulation for the bottom stress may be insufficient\n[Jenter and Madsen, 1989]. Therefore, a 2D depth averaged model may not be considered a good\napproximation, being a three-dimensional application the best modelling option.\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nHorizontal patterns of water temperature\nand salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\nThis work presents results from two complementary and interconnected approaches to study water\n\ntemperature and salinity patterns in an estuarine tidal channel. This channel is one of the four\n\nmain branches of the Ria de Aveiro, a shallow lagoon located in the Northwest coast of the Iberian\n\nPeninsula. Longitudinal and cross-sectional fields of water temperature and salinity were deter-\n\nmined by spatial interpolation of field measurements. A numerical model (Mohid) was used in a\n\ntwo-dimensional depth-integrated mode in order to compute water temperature and salinity patterns.\n\nThe main purpose of this work was to determine the horizontal patterns of water temperature and\n\nsalinity in the study area, evaluating the effects of the main forcing factors. The field results were\n\ndepth-integrated and compared to numerical model results. These results obtained using extreme\n\ntidal and river runoff forcing, are also presented. The field results reveal that, when the river flow is\n\nweak, the tidal intrusion is the main forcing mechanism, generating saline and thermal fronts which\n\nmigrate with the neap/spring tidal cycle. When the river flow increases, the influence of the freshwa-\n\nter extends almost as far as the mouth of the lagoon, and vertical stratification is established. Results\n\nof numerical modelling reveal that the implemented model reproduces quite well the observed hor-\n\nizontal patterns. The model was also used to study the hydrology of the study area under extreme\n\nforcing conditions. When the model is forced with a low river flow (1 m3s?1) the results confirm that\nthe hydrology is tidally dominated. When the model is forced with a high river flow (1000 m3s?1) the\nhydrology is dominated by freshwater, as would be expected in such an area.\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\nCoastal lagoons are saline water bodies separated or partially isolated from the sea. They may be\nenclosed by one or more barrier islands, like Ria Formosa located in Algarve (in southern Portugal),\nas well as sand spits, and linked to the sea by one or more channels, which are small relative to the\nlagoon [Barnes, 1977, 1980], like Ria de Aveiro (in northern Portugal).\n\n\n\n82 Horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\nThe main driving forces of circulation in a large number of estuaries and coastal lagoons are river\nflow at the head of the estuary, and changes in the sea level at the mouth of the estuary, which in turn\ndetermine the distribution of water properties like salinity and temperature, as well as the distribution\nof any other tracer. In coastal lagoons there are other forcing actions like precipitation to evaporation\nbalance, wind stress and surface heat balance [Kjerfve, 1994] and they respond differently to these\nforcing actions.\n\nRia de Aveiro is the largest coastal lagoon in Portugal and the most dynamic in terms of physical\nand biogeochemical processes. It is a very important ecosystem in the region where it is situated due\nto the intense human activity in its waters and along its margins. In the last 20/30 years the lagoon\nwas studied mainly from a biological and chemical point of view. There are not many studies or\npublications regarding the hydrology and physical processes of the lagoon. Despite this fact, a prior\nhydrologic study [Dias et al., 1999] reveals some of the main features of Ria de Aveiro. Records\nof water level, current velocity and thermohaline properties were performed at several stations in\n\nthe lagoon during the summer seasons of 1996 and 1997. It was determined that the type of tide\nat the mouth of the lagoon is semi-diurnal and was observed that the astronomical tide is the main\nforcing driving water circulation in Ria de Aveiro. The tidal wave propagation in the lagoon has the\ncharacteristics of a damped progressive wave. According to this study Ria de Aveiro was found as a\nvertically homogeneous coastal lagoon. Nevertheless, some channels may reveal characteristics of a\npartially mixed estuary, depending on the freshwater input. The importance of the freshwater sources\nin the lagoon dynamics and of its seasonal effects remained to study until this work. The lagoon has\nbeen also studied through numerical modelling. These studies were performed to investigate topics\nas the tidal propagation in the lagoon [Dias et al., 2000], the lagrangian transport of particles [Dias\net al., 2001] and studies of sediment particles [Lopes et al., 2001; Dias et al., 2003].\n\nThe lagoon has several freshwater sources, Vouga River being the most important one. This\nfreshwater source is connected to the Atlantic through a channel located in the central area of the\nlagoon, Espinheiro channel. The major driving force is the tide, which together with the river runoff,\ndetermines the water mass behaviour in the channel. This channel is poorly known in terms of salt\nand heat transport processes, even though it is ideal to perform this kind of studies in Ria de Aveiro.\nThe description of salinity patterns provides a basis for predicting the behaviour of other soluble\nsubstances, being suitable to study since the salt is a natural tracer. This study pretends to be a first\nstep to better comprehend the interaction between the seawater and the freshwater within this system\n\nand to the understanding of its dynamics.\nThese studies require an enormous amount of field data, of salinity, water temperature and current\n\nspeed, as well as the implementation of numerical models that combine hydrodynamic and transport\nmodules. This contribution uses two complementary and interconnected approaches to study the wa-\nter temperature and salinity patterns in Ria de Aveiro, combining field measurements with numerical\nmodelling results. The main purpose of this paper is to determine the horizontal patterns of salt and\nwater temperature in the Espinheiro channel and evaluating the importance of the main forcing mech-\nanisms: tides and incoming river flow. To achieve this intention, a short description of the first annual\n\n\n\n7.2 The study area 83\n\nobservational program of the hydrological properties in Ria de Aveiro will be given. Vertical profiles\nof salinity and water temperature were measured along the channel. These measurements were taken\nat spring and neap tides and the data obtained were used to interpolate longitudinal fields of these\nvariables. An estimation of the river flow for the survey periods was also performed. Results will be\npresented and discussed, that reflect the influence of river flow and spring and neap tide conditions\nin the spatial distribution of the referred hydrological properties. Another aim of this work is to im-\nplement a transport model in a two-dimensional mode for the lagoon\u2019s entire area, with a closer look\nat its central area. The model used was Mohid - Water Modelling System, a finite volume model that\ncombines hydrodynamic and transport modules.\n\n7.2 The study area\n\nThe study area is situated in the very complex central area of Ria de Aveiro, a mesotidal and shallow\n(mean depth ?1 m) coastal lagoon located in the northwest Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula.\nIt includes two distinct regions: the first extending from the mouth of the lagoon to near section 5\n(see fig. 7.1 for reference) and the second is the Espinheiro channel, extending from section 5 to near\nsection 10. The study area is approximately 11 km long, has an average width of about 200 m and a\nmean depth, along its longitudinal axis, of about 10 m. The tides are semi-diurnal and they represent\nthe major driving force of circulation in the lagoon [Dias et al., 1999].\n\n0 200\nkm\n\nSpain\n\n40\u00ba50'\n\n45'\n\n40'\n\n35'\n\n8\u00ba45' 40'\n\n-2.7\n\n2.7\n\n8.2\n\n13.6\n\n19.7\n\n24.6\n\n30.0\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [\n\nm\n] \n\nre\nla\n\nte\nd\n t\n\no\n t\n\nh\ne \n\nlo\nca\n\nl \nd\nat\n\nu\nm\n\nMira\nBoco River\n\nM\nir\n\na \nC\n\nh\nan\n\nn\nel\n\n\u00cdl\nh\nav\n\no\n C\n\nh\nan\n\nn\nel\n\nEs\npi\n\nnh\nei\n\nro\n\n  C\nha\n\nnn\nel\n\nVouga River\n\nA\nn\ntu\n\n\u00e3 \nR\n\niv\ner\n\nS\n. \nJa\n\nci\nn\nto\n\n C\nh\nan\n\nn\nel\n\nA\ntl\n\nan\nti\n\nc \nO\n\nce\nan\n\nLaranjo\n\nCaster\nRiver\n\nG\no\nn\nd\ne\n\nR\niv\n\ner\n\nAveiro\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nZ\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\nK\n\nL\n\nN\n\nM, Q\n\nR\n\nS T\n\nO\n\nP\n\nU\n\nW\n\nV\n\nX\n\nY\n\n0\n\nkm\n\n3\n\nN\n\nE\nsp\n\nin\nhe\n\niro\n\nC\nha\n\nnn\nel\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\nS\n. \nJ\na\nc\nin\n\nto\n C\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\n8\u00ba45'\n\n38'\n\n41'\n\n40'\n\n37'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4 5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nStudy Area\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n(c)\n\nFigure 7.1: Study area, with reference to the location of the stations used to calibrate the hydrody-\nnamic and transport model and the location of the ten cross-sections.\n\n\n\n84 Horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\nThe estimated tidal prism for the lagoon at extreme spring and extreme neap tide is 136.7\u00d7106 and\n34.9\u00d7106 m3, respectively (tidal range of about 2 m) [Dias, 2001]. For the Espinheiro channel is about\n40\u00d7106 at extreme spring tide and 15\u00d7106 m3 at extreme neap tide [Dias, 2001]. The total estimated\nfreshwater input for the lagoon is very small (about 1.8\u00d7106 m3 during a tidal cycle) [Moreira et al.,\n1993] when compared with the tidal prism at the mouth or at the beginning of Espinheiro channel.\nDespite the fact that rivers have a small contribution in terms of water input, when compared to the\ntidal prism, they may have a long term-influence in the residual transport [Dias et al., 2003]. Dias\net al. [2000] and Dias [2001] showed that the tide is strongly distorted as it progresses from the\nmouth toward the end of each channel of the lagoon, due to the channels geometry and bathymetry.\nThe general characteristics of the tidal wave are those of a damped progressive wave. In shallow areas\nthe tidal wave assumes the main characteristics of a standing wave. From a dynamical point of view\nthe study area may be considered the most important in Ria de Aveiro, because here the strongest\ncurrents are observed, reaching values higher than 2 ms?1. The lagoon\u2019s other channels are mainly\nshallow and tidal flat areas, contributing to a strong damping of currents.\n\n7.3 Numerical models\n\n7.3.1 The hydrodynamical and transport models\n\nThe numerical model adopted in this study was Mohid - Water Modelling System [Martins et al.,\n2001] developed by Maretec - Marine and Environmental Technology Center, IST, Lisbon. Mohid\nis a three-dimensional finite volumes model [Chippada et al., 1998], which uses an Arakawa-C grid\n[Arakawa and Lamb, 1977] to perform the computations. In this approach the discrete form of the\ngoverning equations are applied macroscopically to the cell control volume. The grid is therefore\n\ndefined explicitly and the equations are solved using the same procedures, irrespectively of the cell\ngeometry. Since the equations are solved in the form of flux divergences, this method guarantees\nthe conservation of transported properties [Ferziger and Peric, 1995; Vinokur, 1989]. It uses an ADI\n- Alternate Direction Implicit scheme for the resolution of the equations. Two numerical schemes\nare implemented: the four equations S21 scheme [Abbott et al., 1973] and the six equations Leen-\ndertse scheme [Leendertse, 1967]. This model assumes the hydrostatic equilibrium, as well as the\nBoussinesq approximation and uses a vertical double sigma coordinate with a staggered grid.\n\nThe hydrodynamic governing equations are the momentum and the continuity equations. The hy-\ndrodynamic model solves the primitive equations in Cartesian coordinates for incompressible flows.\nThe momentum and mass evolution equations are:\n\n?ui\n?t\n\n+\n?(uiu j)\n?x j\n\n= ? 1\n?0\n\n?patm\n?xi\n\n? g?(?)\n?0\n\n??\n\n?xi\n? g\n?0\n\n? ?\nx3\n\n???\n\n?xi\nd x3\n\n+\n?\n\n?x j\n(?\n?ui\n?x j\n\n) ? 2?i jk? juk (7.1)\n\n\n\n7.3 Numerical models 85\n\n??\n\n?t\n=\n\n?\n\n?x1\n\n? ?\n?h\n\nu1d x3 ?\n?\n\n?x2\n\n? ?\n?h\n\nu2d x3 (7.2)\n\nwhere ui are the velocity vector components in the Cartesian xi directions, ? is the free surface ele-\nvation, ? is the turbulent viscosity and patm is the atmospheric pressure. ? is the density and ?? its\nanomaly, ?0 is the reference density, g is the acceleration of gravity, t is the time, h is the depth, ? is\nthe Earth\u2019s velocity of rotation and ? is the alternate tensor.\n\nThe model also solves a transport equation for salinity and temperature or any tracer. The\nadvection-diffusion equation reads:\n\n??\n\n?t\n+ u j\n\n??\n\n?x j\n=\n\n?\n\n?x j\n(K\n\n??\n\n?x j\n) + F P (7.3)\n\nwhere ? is the transported property, K is the diffusion coefficient and F P is a possible source or sink\nterm.\n\nThe bottom shear stress (~?) is imposed using the formulation proposed by Che?zy [Dronkers,\n1964], where (~?) is proportional to the velocity squared (7.4) and the drag coefficient (CD) can be\nparameterized in terms of the Manning friction coefficient (n) (7.5):\n\n~? = CD | ~V | ~V (7.4)\n\nCD = gn\n2 H?1/3 (7.5)\n\nwhere ~V is the horizontal velocity vector, n is the Manning coefficient and H is the depth of the water\n\ncolumn.\n\n7.3.2 Boundary conditions\n\nFive types of boundaries were used in this study: free surface, bottom, lateral closed boundary, lateral\nopened boundary and moving boundary.\n\nElevation at the open boundary is specified from the tidal constituents obtained using measure-\nments of sea surface elevation from a tidal gauge located at the mouth of the lagoon. Salinity and\nwater temperature are also imposed at the ocean open boundary, and are considered constant in this\nwork. At the river boundaries the river flow is imposed and salinity and water temperature are as-\nsumed constant in each simulation (varying in each case study). The lateral boundary condition at\n\ncoastal boundaries is a free slip condition, imposed by specifying a zero normal component of mass\nand null momentum diffusive fluxes at cell faces in contact with land. No fluxes at the bottom and\nsurface were considered. Moving boundaries are closed boundaries whose position varies in time.\nThis situation occurs in domains with intertidal zones like Ria de Aveiro. In this case the uncovered\ncell must be tracked. A criterion based on Figure 7.2 is used.\n\nH MI N is a minimum depth below which the cell is deemed to be dry, thus, conserving a thin\nvolume of water above the uncovered cell. The cells in position i, j are considered uncovered when\n\n\n\n86 Horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\nFigure 7.2: Conditions for a point to be considered uncovered (moving boundaries).\n\none of the two following conditions occurs:\n\nHi j &lt;H MI N and ?i j?1 &lt;?hi j + H MI N (7.6)\n\nHi j?1 &lt;H MI N and ?i j &lt;?hi j?1 + H MI N (7.7)\n\nwhere H = h + ? is the total depth. The second condition of 7.6 assures that the cell is not being\ncovered by waves propagating from left to right and the second condition of 7.7 assures that the cell\nis not being covered by waves propagating from right to left. The model performs the same test in the\ni direction. The noise resulted from the abrupt variation in the velocity of the dry cells is controlled\nby a careful choice of H MI N (in this case H MI N = 0.1 m) [Leendertse and Liu, 1978].\n\n7.3.3 Application to the Ria de Aveiro\n\nDue to the lagoon complex geometry and in order to decrease the computational effort a variable\nspatial grid step was developed. This grid has 429 by 568 cells, with dimensions ranging from 40\nby 40 m (to obtain a higher resolution) in the central area of the lagoon where the channels are\nvery narrow (represented in Figure 7.1c), to 40 by 100 m in the northern and southern areas, due to\nthe orientation of the channels (north-south). The numerical bathymetry used was developed from\ndata concerning depth obtained from a general survey carried out by the Hydrographic Institute of the\nPortuguese Navy in 1987/88. More recent bathymetric data, obtained from recent dredging operations\nin several channels (1998) and close to the lagoon\u2019s mouth (2002), were also used. The water depth\n\nat each grid point was computed, from the water volume of the cell, using a Monte Carlo cubature\nmethod [Dias, 2001].\n\nThe model was forced imposing at the oceanic open boundary the sea surface elevation deter-\nmined from 38 tidal constituents, obtained through harmonic analysis [Pawlowicz et al., 2002] of\nvalues, measured during 2002 in a tidal gauge located at the mouth of the lagoon. At this open\nboundary the water temperature and salinity were considered fixed in each simulation, with values\nof 15 ?C and 36 practical salinity units (psu), respectively. At the channel\u2019s head river flow values\nestimated for the survey periods, with values between 2 m3s?1 and 116 m3s?1 were imposed. The\n\n\n\n7.3 Numerical models 87\n\nwater temperature and salinity of Vouga River were fixed for each simulation, with values ranging\nbetween 22 ?C (September) and 11 ?C (December) for the water temperature and a fixed value of 1\npsu for the salinity. The time step is 10 s and the horizontal viscosity is 5 m2s?1. Initial conditions\nfor the hydrodynamic model are null free surface gradients and null velocity in all grid points. For\nthe transport model these are salinity and water temperature fields, obtained by interpolation of data\ncollected in the study area on the autumn of 2003. For the transport model more realistic initial val-\nues were adopted because the time to reach dynamic equilibrium for these variables is much longer\nthan that for tides and tidal currents. A value of 5 m2s?1 was adopted for both salt and heat diffusion\ncoefficients.\n\nThe numerical model was implemented in a 2D horizontal mode for the entire area of the lagoon.\nThe goal was to reproduce the distribution patterns of salinity and water temperature in the entire\nlagoon, with a closer look at the study area described in section 7.2. Several simulations were per-\nformed in order to reproduce various field survey periods and to determine the horizontal patterns of\n\nsalinity and water temperature under extreme tidal and river flow forcing conditions.\nThe hydrodynamic model was previously calibrated [Vaz et al., 2004] and validated for Ria de\n\nAveiro. From the observation of sea surface elevation data it is concluded that there is tidal energy\ndamping, due to friction, as the tidal wave propagated toward the end of the channels. In the case\nof Ria de Aveiro this behavior was analyzed by Dias and Fernandes [2006]. The magnitude of\nthe bottom friction coefficient determines changes in the tidal wave propagation within the lagoon.\nThe bottom roughness was parameterized from Manning coefficients; therefore the model parameter\nsubjected to adjustments in the calibration process is the bottom friction coefficient. The procedure\nused to calibrate the model consisted in the spatially varying the bottom roughness by assigning\nManning values to specific regions of the numerical domain.\n\nThe calibration procedure was performed comparing the harmonic constituents of the main tidal\nconstituents determined from computed time series of sea surface elevation to those obtained from\nobserved data for 24 stations located throughout the main channels of the lagoon. The data available\nwas 1987 and 1988 data obtained from a field survey carried out by the Portuguese Navy. The bet-\nter adjustment between computed and observed data was obtained for Manning coefficients ranging\nbetween 0.022 m1/3s?1 and 0.045 m1/3s?1. Figure 7.3 shows the comparison for the M2 constituent,\nwhich is the most important tidal constituent in this lagoon. It represents about 90% of the tidal\nenergy in Ria de Aveiro. For this constituent the mean phase and amplitude difference, for all 24\n\nstations, is 3? and 3 cm, respectively. One error of 1? corresponds to about 2 minutes departure in the\narrival of high tide for a semi-diurnal constituent, which means that the average difference between\nfield and model data is about 6 minutes for the M2. The validation procedure consisted in comparing\nsimulated sea level and current velocities with observed data for 11 stations obtained in the summer\nof 1997. The Root Mean Squared Errors (RMS) of the sea level values are typically around 5% of\nthe local tidal amplitude.\n\nA current velocities comparison for three stations is presented in Figure 7.4.\nRegarding current velocity there are some discrepancies between the field and model data when\n\n\n\n88 Horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\nA\nm\n\npl\nit\n\nud\ne \n\n[m\n]\n\nM\n2\n\ndata\nmodel\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V X Y\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nStatio n\n\nP\nha\n\nse\n [\n\n\u00ba]\n\nM\n2\n\ndata\nmodel\n\nFigure 7.3: Comparison between tidal amplitude and phase for M2 constituent for data and model\nresults, plotted on each station used in the model calibration.\n\n4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1 18/6/97\n\nStation D\n\nRMS=0.133\n\n18 20 22 0 2 4 6 8\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1 20/6/97\n\nStation B\n\nRMS=0.222\n\nV\nel\n\no\nci\n\nty\n [\n\nm\ns\n\n-1\n]\n\n8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n\n 1\n\n 0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1 22/6/97\n\nStation C\n\nRMS=0.173\n\nTime [hours]\n\nFigure 7.4: Comparison between time series of main flow directions velocities of data (dots) and\nmodel results (line), plotted for some of the stations used in the model validation.\n\nassessing point by point. The RMS error for these three stations is lower than 30% of the current\namplitude (the better adjustment is for station D with a RMS error of 6%). Nevertheless, the model\ndoes properly simulate the temporal variation of the current velocity considered in terms of the current\nphase.\n\nResults of the calibration and validation processes indicate that a good implementation of the\nhydrodynamic model was achieved. The agreement between computed and observed time series of\nsea surface elevation rounds a RMS of 5% of the local tidal amplitude for almost all the stations.\n\n\n\n7.3 Numerical models 89\n\nAlso, a good agreement for current velocities was achieved as shown in Figure 7.4. When comparing\ncurrent velocities values it is important to remember that this variable varies rapidly in space, both\nin magnitude and direction, from point to point. This behavior reflects the irregular area geometry\nand it produces higher discrepancies between field and model results. Besides, the model results are\nrelated to the mean value over the vertical and horizontal spatial domain corresponding to the grid\nsize, while the field data corresponds to a single point or, at best, an average over various points.\n\nThe transport model was also calibrated. This procedure was achieved by comparing computed\nand observed short time series of salinity and water temperature for 7 stations in the lagoon. The\navailable data were from July 1996, representing a typical summer situation. A salinity and water\ntemperature comparison for station B is depicted in Figure 7.5, showing a good agreement between\ncomputed and observed data of salinity and water temperature.\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nS\na\nli\n\nn\nit\n\ny\n\nStation B\n\n27/07/96\n\n5 9 14 19 23 4 9 14\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nT\ne\nm\n\np\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\nTime [hours]\n\nStation B\n\n27/07/96\n\nFigure 7.5: Comparison between data (dots) and model results (line) time series of salinity and water\ntemperature, for one station used in the calibration of the transport model\n\nDuring low tide were found differences of about 1 and 3 psu between the model and field salinity\ndata for all the stations used in the transport calibration. At high tide, the differences are lower than\n1 psu. Regarding the water temperature, were found differences, at low tide, of about 3 ?C in some\nof the stations. In shallow systems like Ria de Aveiro the water temperature is ruled not only by the\ntidal propagation and the incoming river flow but also by meteorological factors. The air temperature,\nrelative humidity, cloud cover and incoming solar radiation are very important due to the small depth\nof the water column. In the future, to improve the water temperature results, the exchanges between\nthe water and the air will be included in the runs. Despite this fact, after these results both the\nhydrodynamical and transport models can be considered calibrated.\n\n\n\n90 Horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\n7.4 Field surveys\n\n7.4.1 Materials and methods\n\nIn situ vertical profiles of hydrological properties, such as water temperature and salinity were mea-\nsured in ten cross-sections (Figure 7.1) separated by 1000 meters using a mini STD model SD204.\nThe survey period lasts from September 2003 until September 2004, but for the purpose of this study\nonly the autumn results are analyzed (see Table 7.1).\n\nTable 7.1: Autumn sample periods\nDate Tide Tidal height [m3s?1] River flow [m3s?1]\n\n29/09/2003 spring 2.7 2.06\n02/10/2003 neap 1.6 6.11\n28/10/2003 spring 2.8 5.44\n06/11/2003 neap 2.0 52.62\n25/11/2003 spring 2.8 72.74\n05/12/2003 neap 1.7 115.97\n\nThe first cross-section is located near the mouth of the lagoon and the last one is located near the\n\nchannel\u2019s head, close to the mouth of the Vouga River. The in situ measurements were performed\ntwo times per month at spring tides (maximum of tidal amplitude) and at the following neap tide\n(minimum of tidal amplitude), and started approximately 1h 40min after the low tide hour predicted\nfor section 1, during the flood stream. The profiles of salinity and water temperature were obtained\nat three points in every section: near the margins of the channel and in its axis.\n\nIn order to obtain the incoming freshwater flow from Vouga River, concurrent with the survey\nperiods, measurements of current speed were also performed. These measurements were obtained\nusing a Valeport current meter model 105 and were performed several kilometers upstream from the\nriver mouth, 3 hours after the low tide hour predicted for the lagoon mouth. This procedure guarantees\nthat the measurements of current speed were made outside the region of tidal flood influence.\n\nLongitudinal and cross-sectional fields of water temperature and salinity were determined by\nspatial interpolation of the measured data using an ordinary Point-Krigging method [Cressie, 1993].\nThe longitudinal fields were computed for three different depths: near surface, half water column and\nnear the channel\u2019s bed. Depth integrated longitudinal fields of water temperature and salinity were\nalso computed. These last results were compared to the results of the 2D depth-integrated model used\nin this study. These longitudinal fields act like synoptic snapshots of the channel in terms of water\ntemperature and salinity.\n\n7.5 Results and discussion\n\nAfter being calibrated the hydrodynamic and transport models have been used to study the hydrody-\nnamics and transport of salt and heat in Ria de Aveiro. Several runs were performed to characterize\n\n\n\n7.5 Results and discussion 91\n\nthe dynamics of the lagoon, with a closer look at its central area, in terms of the water temperature\nand salinity behavior, considering different tidal and river runoff forcings.\n\nShort runs of the model were carried out, covering the field survey periods for several spring/neap\ncycles in the autumn of 2003. The results of the model simulations were compared to the field results\nto prove the ability of the implemented model to reproduce the salinity and water temperature patterns\nin the study area.\n\nIn order to analyze the behavior of the study area under extreme conditions several runs of the\nmodel were also performed under conditions of high/low river runoff and astronomical tide forcing\n(neap/spring tidal forcing).\n\nFor the entire study area and for extreme conditions of river runoff and tidal forcing the fractional\nfreshwater concentration [Dyer, 1997] was also computed:\n\nf = 1 ? S n\nS s\n\n(7.8)\n\nwhere S s is the salinity of the undiluted sea water and S n is the mean salinity in a given segment of\nthe estuary. The goal was to determine the relative importance of spring or neap tide forcing and of\nhigh or low river runoff forcing in the establishment of salinity and water temperature patterns in the\nstudy area.\n\n7.5.1 Field surveys\n\nThe mean Vouga River runoff estimated for the period from September to December was about 42.5\nm3s?1, with a minimum value of 2.06 m3s?1 (September) and a maximum of 115.97 m3s?1 (De-\ncember). The autumn of 2003 may be considered a dry season when compared to previous years\n\n[Dias, 2001]. Results of salinity and water temperature for these extreme cases will be analyzed and\ndiscussed. In this period the tidal amplitude ranges from a minimum of 1.6 m on October 2nd and a\nmaximum of 2.8 m in all the spring\u2019s dates.\n\nFigure 7.6 illustrates the differences in the distribution patterns of salinity in the case of two neap\ntide periods (tidal amplitudes of 1.6 and 1.7 m) and in conditions of low and high river flow (6.11 and\n115.97 m3s?1) for three different depths: surface, mid water and near the bed. In the case of the low\nriver flow, the channel can be considered nearly vertically homogeneous and highly saline, almost as\nfar as section 8, where a saline front is observed. Close to the channel\u2019s head, the relative effect of\nthe freshwater inflow increases and values of salinity between 6 (surface) and 11 psu (bottom) are\nobserved. For the high river flow, the effect of the freshwater extends to the mouth of the lagoon,\nmainly in the surface layer, leading to vertical stratification (near the surface, the salinity is about\n22.5 psu and near the bottom is about 32.5).\n\nThe longitudinal gradients of water temperature are less perceptible (weaker) than those of salin-\nity, both in spring and neap tide conditions. As an example, the water temperature values ranges\nbetween 11 and 14 ?C in the neap tide period of December 5th, while the salinity gradient ranges\n\n\n\n92 Horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\na\n\nn\n\nAveiro\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1 2\n\n1 6\n\n2 0\n\n2 4\n\n2 8\n\n3 2\n\n3 6\n\nS\na\n\nli\nn\n\nit\ny\n\n02/10/2003\n  Surface\n\n6.11 m s\n3 -1\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1 2\n\n1 6\n\n2 0\n\n2 4\n\n2 8\n\n3 2\n\n3 6\n\nS\na\n\nli\nn\n\nit\ny\n\n05/12/2003\n Surface\n\n115.97 m s\n3 -1\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1 2\n\n1 6\n\n2 0\n\n2 4\n\n2 8\n\n3 2\n\n3 6\n\nS\na\n\nli\nn\n\nit\ny\n\n02/10/2003\n Mid-water\n\n6.11 m s\n3 -1\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1 2\n\n1 6\n\n2 0\n\n2 4\n\n2 8\n\n3 2\n\n3 6\n\nS\na\n\nli\nn\n\nit\ny\n\n05/12/2003\n Mid-water\n\n115.97 m s\n3 -1\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\n8\u00ba45'\n\n38'\n\n41'\n\n40'\n\n37'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1 2\n\n1 6\n\n2 0\n\n2 4\n\n2 8\n\n3 2\n\n3 6\n\nS\na\n\nli\nn\n\nit\ny\n\n02/10/2003\n   Bottom\n\n6.11 m s\n3 -1\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\n8\u00ba45' 41' 37'\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n1 2\n\n1 6\n\n2 0\n\n2 4\n\n2 8\n\n3 2\n\n3 6\n\nS\na\n\nli\nn\n\nit\ny\n\n05/12/2003\n   Bottom\n\n115.97 m s\n3 -1\n\nFigure 7.6: Surface, mid-water and bottom salinity distributions.

However, the temperature patterns are similar to those\ndiscussed for the salinity.\n\nThe effect of the river runoff increase at the mouth of the lagoon is shown in the cross-sectional\ndistribution of salinity at section 1 for the cases presented in Figure 7.6. These results (see Figure\n7.7) reveal the influence of the low and high river flow at section 1. When the river flow is weak,\nthe cross-sectional distribution of salinity is almost vertically homogeneous and the water column\nis mainly saline. When the river runoff is high, the freshwater influence is felt even at the lagoon\u2019s\nmouth, being established a vertical gradient of salinity, ranging from ?20 at the surface to ?35 psu\nat the bottom. At the channel\u2019s head the river flow induces an opposite effect. When the river\nflow is high the cross-sectional salinity distribution is almost vertically homogeneous (water column\ncharacterized by freshwater) and when the river flow is weak a vertical stratification is established.\n\nThe field results show that when the river flow is weak (with values ranging between 2 and 6\nm3s?1), the saline intrusion goes further along the channel than under strong freshwater runoff. Even\nin the case of low river flow, the channel\u2019s head is mainly filled by freshwater and as the saline\n\n\n\n7.5 Results and discussion 93\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32\n\nDistance [dam]\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n3 3 .8 3 3 .9 3 4 .0 3 4 .1 3 4 .2 3 4 .3 3 4 .4 3 4 .5\n\n1a 1b 1c 1d 1e\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n18\n\n21\n\n24\n\n27\n\n Section 1\n02/10/2003Survey points\n\nSalinity\n\n(a)\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32\n\nDistance [dam]\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n2 0 .5 2 2 .0 2 3 .5 2 5 .0 2 6 .5 2 8 .0 2 9 .5 3 1 .0 3 2 .5 3 4 .0 3 5 .5\n\n1a 1b 1c 1d 1e\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n18\n\n21\n\n24\n\n27\n\n  Section 1\n05/12/2003Survey points\n\nSalinity\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.7: Salinity cross-sections at section 1.

In these cases the hydrodynamics of\n\nthe study area are determined mainly by the tide. In the opposite case, when the river flow is high,\nthe freshwater extends its influence toward the lagoon\u2019s mouth leading to vertical stratification along\nmost of the channel.\n\nSaline and thermal fronts are generated between sections 8 and 9 in spring tide periods. These\nfronts are probably generated as a response to bathymetric features and river runoff variability. In this\nregion, the channel\u2019s depth changes abruptly (from 10 m to ?2 m) and the tidal excursion reaches\nthe region of freshwater influence, where the salty water (more dense) mixes with the incoming\nfreshwater leading to a pronounced horizontal gradient of salinity and water temperature. These\nfronts could migrate with the spring/neap tidal cycle and with changes in the river flow. In fact, these\nfronts are the boundary between two distinct areas of this channel: the first one extends from the\nmouth of the lagoon until near section 7 and it is dominated by the tidal flux; the other is one area\nthat could be considered as the fluvial estuary of the Vouga River, being characterized by freshwater\ninputs but still subjected to tidal effects.\n\nAt neap tides, these strong horizontal gradients are observed between sections 7 and 8, about 1\nkm closer to the mouth of the lagoon, because the saline intrusion does not extend so far in this case\ndue to smaller tidal prisms and current velocities.\n\nFor similar freshwater inputs the salinity difference between the mouth of the lagoon and the\n\nchannel\u2019s head is larger at neaps than at springs, when the tidal currents are stronger and the oceanic\nwater intrusion goes further within the channel. The relative effect of the river flow in the horizontal\npatterns of salinity and water temperature is stronger at neaps, when the tidal currents are weaker.\n\nIn Figure 7.8 are depicted the along channel depth averaged salinity (7.8a and 7.8b) and water\ntemperature (7.8c and 7.8d) values. From 7.8a and 7.8b is perceptible that when the river flow is\nsimilar (September and October data) the tidal excursion goes further upstream in spring than in neap\n\n\n\n94 Horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\ntide (?1 km), due to the higher velocity currents. When the end of the autumn is closer, the river\nflow increases and its effect become more important in the establishment of the salinity patterns than\nthe tidal effect. The freshwater influence extends itself until section 6. When the river flow is 115.97\nm3s?1, the influence of the freshwater extends almost section 3 (1 km from the mouth of the lagoon)\nwith salinities lower than 30 psu.\n\nFigures 7.8c and 7.8d show the autumn variation of the water temperature along the channel. It\ncan be observed that the water temperature values decay along the season and that exists an inversion\nof the temperature gradients between the beginning of the autumn and its end. In fact, in September\nand October the oceanic temperatures values are lower than the river ones, and in November and\nDecember it is noticeable the opposite. The figures previously depicted show that the sample strategy\nis correct and the data are reliable.\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nSa\nlin\n\nity\n [P\n\nSU\n]\n\n(a)\n\n26/09\n28/10\n25/11\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n(b)\n\nSa\nlin\n\nity\n [P\n\nSU\n]\n\n02/10\n06/11\n05/12\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22 (c)\n\nTe\nm\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\u00ba\nC\n\n]\n\nSection number\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22(d)\n\nSection number\n\nTe\nm\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\nFigure 7.8: Depth-averaged along channel salinity and water temperature values.

The purpose of these short simulations\n\nwas to find out if the numerical model is able to reproduce the measured saline and thermal fronts in\nsuch a complex area.\n\nFigure 7.9 shows the numerically computed and observed depth integrated fields of water tem-\nperature for the neap tide period of October 2nd (low river flow - 6.11 m3s?1) and December 5th (high\nriver flow - 115.97 m3s?1). The results of the 2D depth integrated model are consistent with the mea-\nsurements, as shown in the figure. The model results and the measurements reveal similar patterns in\nthe longitudinal distribution of salinity (not shown) and water temperature. The thermal and saline\n(not shown) fronts are well reproduced by the model as shown in Figures 7.9a and 7.9b. The model\n\n\n\n7.5 Results and discussion 95\n\nresults show the thermal front placed in the exactly same area as revealed by the measurements.\nWhen the river flow increases, the effect of the freshwater inflow in the channel is well reproduced\nby the transport model. The numerical results reproduce the observed longitudinal gradient of water\ntemperature, which extends from the channel\u2019s head until the lagoon\u2019s mouth, where values of 14 ?C\nare observed in both situations. Therefore, it can be considered that a 2D depth integrated model is a\nreliable tool to study transport processes in shallow areas like Ria de Aveiro.\n\nE\nsp\n\nin\nhe\n\niro\n\n c\nha\n\nnn\nel\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\na\n\nn\n\nAveiro\n\nS\n. \nJ\na\nc\nin\n\nto\n c\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n17.0\n\n17.3\n\n17.6\n\n17.9\n\n18.2\n\n18.5\n\n18.8\n\n19.1\n\n19.4\n\n19.7\n\n20.0\n\nT\ne\nm\n\np\ne\n\nra\ntu\n\nre\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\n(a)\n\n6.11 m s\n3 -1\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\n8\u00ba45'\n\n38'\n\n41'\n\n40'\n\n37'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n11.0\n\n11.3\n\n11.6\n\n11.9\n\n12.2\n\n12.5\n\n12.8\n\n13.1\n\n13.4\n\n13.7\n\n14.0\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n(c)\n\n115.97 m s\n3 -1\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\n17.0\n\n17.3\n\n17.6\n\n17.9\n\n18.2\n\n18.5\n\n18.8\n\n19.1\n\n19.4\n\n19.7\n\n20.0\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\n(b)\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\n6.11 m s\n3 -1\n\nVouga River\nA\n\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\n8\u00ba45' 41' 37'\n\n1 1 .0\n\n1 1 .3\n\n1 1 .6\n\n1 1 .9\n\n1 2 .2\n\n1 2 .5\n\n1 2 .8\n\n1 3 .1\n\n1 3 .4\n\n1 3 .7\n\n1 4 .0\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\n(d)\n\n115.97 m s\n3 -1\n\nFigure 7.9: Depth-integrated water temperature fields.

One of these studies is to evaluate how the study area responds to changes in the forcing\nfactors and determine the establishment of salinity and water temperature longitudinal patterns under\ndifferent forcing conditions. As previously proved these studies can be performed using the model\nin a horizontal two-dimensional mode. In this case the simulations were performed under extreme\nforcing conditions of astronomical tidal forcing and high and low river flow.\n\nVicente [1985] presents values correspondent to flood flows for periods of 25 and 100 years of\n3400 and 4100 m3s?1, respectively. Another study by Castanho et al. [1968] presents values for the\nmaximum daily flow, for return periods of 1, 5, 10 and 25 years, of 505, 875, 960 and 1020 m3s?1.\nMeanwhile, Castanho et al. [1968], present values of minimum flow of the order of 1 m3s?1. The\nmodel simulations were performed using river flows of 1 m3s?1 and 1000 m3s?1. These values can\nbe considered extreme taking into account the values presented in this paragraph.\n\nFigure 7.10 shows results of the longitudinal salinity fields for 2 different situations: (a) spring\ntide combined with river flow of 1000 m3s?1 during high tide and (b) neap tide with river flow of\n\n\n\n96 Horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n1 0\n1 2\n1 4\n1 6\n1 8\n2 0\n2 2\n2 4\n2 6\n2 8\n3 0\n3 2\n3 4\n\nS\na\nli\nn\nit\ny\n\n High Tide\nSpring Tide\n       (a)\n\n1000 m s\n3  -1\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\n8\u00ba45'\n\n38'\n\n41'\n\n40'\n\n37'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n1 0\n1 2\n1 4\n1 6\n1 8\n2 0\n2 2\n2 4\n2 6\n2 8\n3 0\n3 2\n3 4\n3 6\n\nS\na\nli\nn\nit\ny\n\n Low Tide\nNeap Tide\n      (b)\n\n1000 m s\n3  -1\n\nFigure 7.10: Depth integrated salinity fields (model results).

The 2D depth integrated results using a river flow of 1 m3s?1 are not\nshown because they are almost redundant concerning the results shown in section 7.5.1.\n\nWhen the low tide is reached, the model results are in agreement with the expected pattern of\nsalinity both in spring (not shown) and neap tide periods. In fact, these results reveal that, in this\ncase, the freshwater extends throughout all the study area (including the coastal zone) revealing that\nthe Vouga River influence is very important in the establishment of the hydrology of the study area\nduring flood periods. Therefore, due to the relatively small channel dimensions very low salinity\nvalues are obtained for the outside of the lagoon both at neap tide (between 7 and 9 psu) and at spring\ntide (between 5 to 8 psu) when the currents are higher.\n\nDuring flood periods, the tide pushes the freshwater upstream revealing that, even in this extreme\nsituation of river flow, the salinity intrusion is very significant along the length of the study area.\nWhen the high tide is reached, a longitudinal salinity gradient is established both at neaps (not shown)\nand springs. However, even at high tide, salinity at the lagoon\u2019s entrance is lower than the typical\nocean values (around 36 psu), as found in the previous cases of low river flow. The freshwater that\n\nleaves the lagoon during the ebb dilutes the oceanic water in the coastal region near the lagoon\u2019s\nmouth. During the flood this freshwater enters the lagoon and mixes with the freshwater incoming\nfrom Vouga. The values of salinity in the mouth of the lagoon are between 22 and 25 psu in spring and\nneap tide, respectively. The patterns of water temperature are the same as the discussed for salinity.\n\nThe fractional freshwater concentration [Dyer, 1997] was also computed for two of the studied\nsituations: minimum freshwater and maximum freshwater within the estuary. The results are depicted\nin Figure 7.11 and show that the minimum amount of water within the channel occurred in spring\n\n\n\n7.6 Conclusions 97\n\ntide conditions with a low river flow of 1 m3s?1 when the high tide is reached (Figure 7.11a). In this\ncase, values lower than 0.1 were found almost up to the channel\u2019s head, revealing that in the study\narea, there is almost no dilution of the salt water coming from the ocean. The saline intrusion goes\nfurther upstream than in any other case and the channels are filled with salt water. In this situation the\nhydrology is completely tidally dominated. The maximum freshwater within the channel occurred\nin the case of neap tide conjugated with an extreme river flow of 1000 m3s?1, when the low tide is\nreached (Figure 7.11b). Values ranging between 0.7 and 0.8 were found from the channel\u2019s head up\nto the lagoon\u2019s mouth. In this case the hydrology of the channels is strongly dependent on the Vouga\nRiver forcing and the study area is filled with freshwater.\n\nE\nsp\n\nin\nhe\n\niro\n\n c\nha\n\nnn\nel\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\nS\n. \nJ\na\nc\nin\n\nto\n c\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n0\n\n0 .1\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .3\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .5\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .7\n\n0 .8\n\n0 .9\n\n1\n\nF\nra\n\nc\nti\no\nn\na\nl \nF\n\nre\ns\nh\nw\n\na\nte\n\nr\n\n  High Tide\n27/09/2003\n    Spring\n        (a)\n\n   1 m s\n3  -1\n\nVouga River\n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n\nO\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\nAveiro\n\n8\u00ba45'\n\n38'\n\n41'\n\n40'\n\n37'\n\n40\u00ba42'\n\n0\n\n0 .1\n\n0 .2\n\n0 .3\n\n0 .4\n\n0 .5\n\n0 .6\n\n0 .7\n\n0 .8\n\n0 .9\n\n1\n\nF\nra\n\nc\nti\no\nn\na\nl \nF\n\nre\ns\nh\nw\n\na\nte\n\nr\n\n  Low Tide\n06/12/2003\n    Neap\n      (b)\n\n1000 m s\n3  -1\n\nFigure 7.11: Fractional freshwater concentrations.

Observations reveal the existence of vertical stratification\nin the study area when the river runoff is high. The salty water, more dense, develops within the\n\nchannel through the bottom layer, near the channel\u2019s bed, and the freshwater through the top layer,\nrevealing a typical estuarine behavior.\n\nResults obtained using field data show a strong horizontal gradient of salinity and water temper-\nature which migrates with the spring /neap cycle. This strong horizontal gradient seems to mark the\n\n\n\n98 Horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity in an estuarine tidal channel\n\nboundary between two distinguished sectors: a marine estuary, in close connection with the sea and\nan upper fluvial estuary characterized by the freshwater from the river but still subject to a semi-\ndiurnal tidal effect. In this channel, for low river flow, these estuarine fronts migrate from between\nsection 7 and 8 to between section 8 and 9 (about 1 km), depending if the tide is a neap or a spring\none, respectively.\n\nThe model used in a two-dimensional horizontal depth integrated mode reproduces the main\nfeatures found from the field data. When the river flow is weak, the saline and thermal fronts are\nwell reproduced by the model as previously showed. When the river flow is high, even thought\nthe model results are consistent with the expected patterns, it would be more adequate to study the\ntransport processes using the model in a three-dimensional mode, in order to reproduce the vertical\nstratification found from the measurements. Due to the complexity of the study area, this is a very\ndifficult task, which is presently being performed. It can be considered that Mohid was successfully\nimplemented and that it is a useful tool to study transport processes in complex estuarine environment.\n\nResults obtained with a Lagrangian approach by Dias et al. [2003] are in agreement with the\npresent conclusions confirming the importance of these channels from the hydrodynamic and trans-\nport perspective. Trajectories of passive tracers released along the channel revealed that the transport\nwas towards the lagoon\u2019s mouth. These results indicate the low residence time of the central area of\nthe lagoon and the importance of the water exchanged between the channel and the ocean.\n\nIn the future results from the three-dimensional model will be studied in order to perform better\nhydrodynamic and transport studies in this area.\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nThree-dimensional modelling of the\nEspinheiro Channel\n\nA 3D baroclinic model (Mohid) is used to perform hindcast simulations in a tidal channel: Espi-\n\nnheiro Channel (Portugal). These simulations are conducted for four distinct periods where markedly\n\ndifferent river discharges and tides occurred, and the outputs are compared with time series measure-\n\nments and synoptic thermohaline data. The model reveals its ability in reproducing observed tempo-\n\nral variability in sea level height and along channel velocity, presenting skill coefficients higher than\n\n0.85. The model qualitatively reproduces along-channel thermohaline distributions at three different\n\nvertical levels, during low-to-medium river inflow, underestimating the salinity stratification when\n\nthe river flow is high (higher than 100 m3s?1). In general, the trends inferred from the observation\nare reproduced by the numerical model.\n\nThe residual currents were calculated revealing an ebb-dominated channel, with more intense\n\nebb current near the surface, due to the freshwater incoming from the landward boundary, and less\n\nintense ebb current near the channel\u2019s bed. The cross-sectional tidally-averaged structure of salinity\n\nand longitudinal velocity analyzed near the channel\u2019s mouth and ?4 km upstream reveal ebb residual\ncurrents near the south shore and flood residual currents near the north shore under low-to-medium\n\nriver discharge. When the river discharge is high (higher than 100 m3s?1), the channel is nearly\nlaterally homogeneous in terms of salinity and residual velocity presenting a two-layer structure with\n\nflood currents near the bottom and ebb currents at the top layer. The salt transport was also analyzed\n\nand follows the same patterns found in the cross-sectional residual velocity.\n\nThe cross-sectional vertical structure of the channel, near its mouth, presents well mixed char-\n\nacteristics during high water, turning to partially stratified at low water. At mid channel the vertical\n\ncross-sectional structure turn from weakly-to-strongly stratified during the tidal cycle. Near the chan-\n\nnel\u2019s mouth, the water exchange is mainly driven by the tidal forcing, except under high river flow\n\nevents when the freshwater extends its influence from the channel\u2019s head to its mouth.\n\n\n\n100 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\n8.1 Introduction\n\nEspinheiro channel is a tidal channel located in the central area of Ria de Aveiro, a mesotidal coastal\nlagoon located in the north coast of Portugal. This channel is located in the very complex central area\nof the lagoon and it includes two distinct regions: the first extending from the mouth of the lagoon to\nabout 1 km upstream station C (Figure 8.1) and the second is the Espinheiro channel itself, extending\nfrom that point to the east boundary of the channel (a few kilometers upstream). For simplicity,\nthe study area from the mouth of the lagoon until the Vouga River will be hereinafter referred as\nEspinheiro channel.\n\nThis channel connects the major source of freshwater of the lagoon (Vouga River), responsible\nfor more than 2/3 of the freshwater input [Dias et al., 1999], and the Atlantic Ocean and receives\ncontributions from several other channels (see Figure 8.1). The main stem stretches for approximately\n11 km long, having an average width of about 200 m and a mean depth along its longitudinal axis\nof about 10 m. The tides are mixed semidiurnal, with M2 being the most important constituent,\n\n40\u00ba50'\n\n45'\n\n40'\n\n35'\n\n8\u00ba45' 40'\n\n-2.7\n\n2.7\n\n8.2\n\n13.6\n\n19.7\n\n24.6\n\n30.0\n\nD\ne\np\n\nth\n [\n\nm\n] \n\nre\nla\n\nte\nd\n\n t\no\n\n t\nh\n\ne\n l\n\no\nc\na\nl \n\nd\na\ntu\n\nm\n\n0 200\nkm\n\nSpain\n\nMira\nBoco River\n\nM\nir\n\na\n C\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\n\u00cdl\nh\na\nv\no\n C\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\nE\nsp\n\nin\nhe\n\nir\no\n\n  C\nha\n\nnn\nel\n\nVouga River\n\nA\nn\ntu\n\n\u00e3\n R\n\niv\ne\nr\n\nS\n. \nJa\n\nc\nin\n\nto\n C\n\nh\na\nn\nn\ne\nl\n\nA\ntl\n\na\nn\nti\n\nc\n O\n\nc\ne\na\nn\n\nLaranjo\n\nCaster\nRiver\n\nG\no\n\nn\nd\n\ne\nR\n\niv\ne\nr\n\nAveiro\n\n0\n\nkm\n\n3\n\nN\n\n37'41'45'8\u00ba 49'\n\n36'\n\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba 42'\n\nDepth [m] relative to the local datum\n\n-1.0 10.0 21.0 32.0 43.0\n\nA\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nA - Barra\nB - Cais Comercial\nC - Sacor\nD - Parrachil\n\nVouga River\n\n- Discharges\n\nAtlantic\nOcean\n\n- stations\n\n37'41'45'8\u00ba 49'\n\n36'\n\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba 42'\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 8.1: (a) Bathymetry of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon and adjacent coastal area.

The tidal forcing is important with a\nrange at the lagoon\u2019s mouth higher than 3 m during spring tides [Dias et al., 1999]. The channel\u2019s\ndynamics is mainly controlled by the interaction of tides and incoming river flow. However, it is\nalso influenced by water exchanges with other channels. The channel\u2019s vertical structure is strongly\ndependent on the tidal strength and river inflow, changing from well mixed to partially stratified. For\nexample, during the flood some regions may present salt wedge or partially stratified characteristics\nbecoming well mixed by the end of the ebb. Thus, the channel\u2019s behavior adjusts dynamically to\nchanges in the river flow and tidal mixing, as revealed by MacCready [1999] in his theoretical study\nin an idealized channel. The lack of continuous (or periodic) observational programs, which allow\nthe characterization of the vertical structure of the channel, become necessary the implementation of\nnumerical models to perform detailed physical studies.\n\nRia de Aveiro has four main channels, and due to their unique characteristics each one of them\nmay be considered as an independent estuary connected to a common inlet. The hydrography of each\n\nchannel is determined by different tidal prisms and freshwater inputs. The estimated tidal prism for\nthe lagoon\u2019s mouth at extreme spring and extreme neap is according to Dias [2001] 136.7 \u00d7 106 and\n34.9\u00d7106 m3, respectively. Near station C (?1 km upstream) it is about 40\u00d7106 at extreme spring and\n15 \u00d7 106 m3 at extreme neap tide [Dias, 2001]. The total estimated freshwater input for the lagoon is\nvery small (about 1.8 \u00d7 106 m3 during a complete tidal cycle) [Moreira et al., 1993] when compared\nto the tidal prism, both at the mouth and at the beginning of Espinheiro channel. The small ratio\nbetween the freshwater input and the tidal prisms indicate the circulation is mainly induced by tides.\nHowever, the combination of these two factors (tidal regime and freshwater inflow) highly influences\nthe thermohaline horizontal patterns [Vaz et al., 2005a].\n\nEspinheiro channel has a low ratio between tidal amplitude and depth, revealing an ebb dominated\nchannel [Dias, 2001]. The channel is very dynamic, presenting current velocity maximums higher\nthan 2 ms?1 [Dias, 2001]. Generally, the longitudinal salinity differences lie between 20 and over\nthan 30 psu, depending on the freshwater inputs [Dias, 2001; Vaz et al., 2005a]. The channel can be\ndivided into three distinct regions: (a) a marine or lower estuary dominated by ocean waters, (b) a\nmiddle estuary where the mixing between the fresh and salt water occurs and (c) an upper or fluvial\nestuary characterized by freshwater, but subject to a daily tidal action. This delimitation is dynamic\nand can change seasonally (or in lower time scales) due to the tide, winds or the freshwater inflow.\nThis dynamic delimitation has been referred by Kjerfve [1990] and Miranda et al. [2002] in their\n\nstudies. The advection plays a major role on the salt transport in the Espinheiro Channel. However,\ndiffusion processes may also be relevant contributors for the salt transport [Vaz and Dias, submitted].\nDias et al. [2003] computed residence times lower than 2 days for the whole study area, revealing a\ngood water renewal.\n\nIn the past, due to the general shallowness of the lagoon (averaged depth of 1 m over the local\ndatum) the lagoon was modelled using a 2D depth-integrated model [Dias et al., 2000; Dias, 2001;\nDias et al., 2003]. The hydrodynamic and transport model results were compared to measurements\n\n\n\n102 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\nat monitoring stations throughout the lagoon, and this comparison revealed a good fit between model\nresults and observations.\n\nThe model used in this study is Mohid, a 3D baroclinic modelling system which has been used\nto simulate several estuaries and coastal systems. In the Ria de Aveiro, Mohid has been used to\nperform water quality studies [Trancoso et al., 2005; Saraiva, 2005] in which macroalgae productivity\nhas been studied. The horizontal patterns of water temperature and salinity were modelled using\nMohid [Vaz et al., 2005a] implemented in a 2D depth-integrated mode. The model results have been\ncompared with a field data set, and the results reveal that the model reproduces qualitatively the\nobserved longitudinal thermohaline distributions.\n\nNowadays, a major motivation to implement and improve hydrodynamic models is the impor-\ntance of 3D localized processes in the scope of the hydrodynamic influence on the water quality of\nestuarine areas. Observational programs often do not cover the entire study area. Therefore 3D hy-\ndrodynamic models may be used to complement observations. The narrow and complex morphology\n\nof the channel with its several contributors makes this area a challenging place to develop, for the\nfirst time, a predictive three-dimensional model.\n\nThis work describes the implementation of Mohid in a 3D mode for the Espinheiro channel, pro-\nviding a comparison of several short hindcast simulations to a set of time series and spatial thermo-\nhaline distributions of the Espinheiro channel. The general circulation within the channel is studied\nusing different forcing conditions: spring and neap tides and low-to-high river inflow. Issues like\nthe cross-sectional tidal and tidally-average structure are analyzed and the channel vertical structure\nis examined using estuarine parameters as the Richardson number and the buoyancy frequency. The\navailable measured data are sparse in time. The data used in this work were obtained during 1987 (sea\nlevel height), 1997 (water velocity), 2003 and 2004 (thermohaline distributions). Model/data com-\nparison provides a qualitative/quantitative evaluation of the model\u2019s predictive skill and may point out\nseveral aspects on the model\u2019s parameterizations or the forcing data that require some improvement.\n\nThe transport model simulations cover four periods correspondent to spring and neap tide and\nlow-to-high river inflow and the hydrodynamic is validated using the sea level height and current\nvelocity referred above. The paper structure is as follows. Section 8.2 describes the model\u2019s physics\nand configuration for the Espinheiro Channel and in the next sections the results and conclusions are\npresented.\n\n8.2 Model\n\n8.2.1 Model physics\n\nThe Espinheiro Channel\u2019s predictive model is an implementation of Mohid - Water Modelling Sys-\ntem. Mohid is a baroclinic finite volume model, designed for coastal and estuarine shallow water\napplications, like Ria de Aveiro, where flow over complex topography, flooding and drying of inter-\n\n\n\n8.2 Model 103\n\ntidal areas, changing stratification or mixing conditions are all important. Mohid allows an integrated\nmodelling approach of physical and biogeochemical processes.\n\nMohid has been used to model hydrodynamic and thermohaline transport in several estuaries and\ncoastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula. Martins et al. [2001] simulate the flow features of a mesotidal\nwell mixed estuary, bringing to evidence the advantages of the finite-volume method to implement\nthe generic vertical coordinate; the circulation pattern driven by tide and horizontal density gradient\nbetween river and shelf waters was established for the Ria of Pontevedra (NW Spain), and the vari-\nability of tidal velocities and salinity was studied [Villarreal et al., 2002]; a methodology, based on\nthe computation of the residence time and integrated water fraction, to understand the transport pat-\nterns in the Tagus estuary (Portugal) was proposed by Braunschweig et al. [2003]; and the horizontal\npatterns of thermohaline properties under extreme forcing events were studied in Ria de Aveiro [Vaz\net al., 2005a]. Mohid is a modelling system continuously under development, and the home page can\nbe found at http://www. mohid.com. Some of the key features of the model are highlighted below.\n\nA complete description of the model can be found in Martins et al. [2001], Leita?o [2003] or Theias\n[2005].\n\nMohid solves the equations of motion using an orthogonal (or curvilinear) Arakawa-C grid\n[Arakawa and Lamb, 1977]. The temporal discretization is carried out using a semi-implicit al-\ngorithm: the ADI - Alternate Direction Implicit [Abbott and Basco, 1994]. This algorithm is applied\nin the computation of the water level. This hydrodynamic property is computed from the divergence\nof the horizontal water fluxes. The ADI algorithm assumes alternatively one component of the hor-\nizontal velocity implicitly while the other is calculated explicitly, avoiding the computation of the\ninternal and external modes with different time steps (mode splitting approach). The model has a\nsimple method for handling the flooding/drying of intertidal areas, in which the uncovered cells are\ntracked. This method consists on defining one depth below which the cell is considered uncovered\n(H MI N), conserving a thin layer of water above the uncovered cell. The cells are considered uncov-\nered if the total depth (H = ? + h) is lower than H MI N and if the sea level height (?) is lower than\nthe local depth (h) plus H MI N [Martins et al., 2001].\n\nMohid has several high order advection schemes. In this work, the horizontal and vertical advec-\ntion of momentum and mass are computed using a TVD-Superbee method (total variation diminish-\ning) [Roe, 1985]. Lately, this method is being recommended for coastal and estuarine simulations\n[Gross et al., 1999; Stips et al., 2004; Banas and Hickey, 2005]. This method is free from numerical\n\noscillations and guaranteed to be stable and less computationally expensive.\nMohid also allows the choice between several turbulence closures. It has coupled the one-\n\ndimensional General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) [Burchard et al., 1999], a water-column\nmodel which allows the use of different turbulent closure schemes. Here, two different closure\nschemes were used for the calculation of the turbulent viscosity/diffusivity coefficients: the ? ? ?\nand the Mellor-Yamada schemes [Burchard and Bolding, 2001; Mellor and Yamada, 1982] using the\nstability function parameterization proposed by Canuto et al. [2001]. Warner et al. [2005] tested a\nnumber of two-equation schemes (???, ???, ?? ?l) and found minor differences in their ability to\n\n\n\n104 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\nreproduce estuarine salinity fields. A review of these two-equation schemes can be found in Burchard\n[2002].\n\n8.2.2 Model\u2019s configuration for the Espinheiro Channel\n\nMohid has been configured to be applied in the Espinheiro Channel. Bathymetry in the channel is\nextracted from data obtained by the Hydrographic Institute of the Portuguese Navy in 1987/1988.\n\nMore recent bathymetric data, obtained from recent dredging operations in several channels (1998)\nand close to the lagoon\u2019s mouth (2002), were also used. Figure 8.1 shows the model\u2019s bathymetry\nand grid. An orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system [Driscoll and Vavasis, 1998] was designed\nto follow the general orientation of the channel including its major tributaries and the near coastal\nocean. The grid spacing is less than 100 m in the longitudinal and about 50 m in the cross-channel\ndirection. High resolution is used in order to properly resolve the physical features of the channel.\nThe total number of grid points is 200 by 200 and, in the vertical direction, the model uses 10 sigma\nlayers. The domain was designed to resolve the channel\u2019s dynamic, and not the dynamics of the near\ncoastal ocean. Although the near shelf bathymetry is realistic (limiting the computational time), there\nare no measurements of physical variables that allow a full implementation (calibration/validation) of\nthe model, permitting the coupling between the channel\u2019s internal dynamic and shelf processes. This\ncoupling process remains a future goal.\n\nRia de Aveiro is a branched coastal lagoon in which the shelf waters that enter spread toward the\nmain channels. Thus, the amount of water at upstream locations is lower than at the lagoon\u2019s inlet.\nThis affects the dynamics of the study area. The arrow marked boundaries depicted in Figure 8.1b\nwere included in the curvilinear grid in order to simulate the inflow/outflow of water between the\nEspinheiro Channel and the neighborhood channels. Thus, in order to simulate this inflow/outflow\n\nat these locations, the model use as boundary conditions water flow, salinity and water temperature\ntime series computed using a two-dimensional (depth-integrated) application of the model for all the\narea of the lagoon.\n\nThe 2D application uses a variable spatial step cartesian grid with higher resolution in the central\narea of the lagoon (40\u00d740 m), calculating time-varying discharge, salinity and water temperature\ntime series at the arrow marked locations. At the open ocean boundary the model was forced using\ntides and at the landward boundary the forcing was river inflow values typical for each run. At the\noceanic and landward boundaries, the water temperature and salinity are considered fixed in each\nsimulation, typical values being imposed for each period. At the surface, heat fluxes were imposed.\nThe model uses the heat fluxes parameterizations described by Chapra [1997] (see Section 4.5). The\nmeteorological data used are from the University of Aveiro automatic station and are concurrent with\nthe simulated periods. The time step is 10 s and the horizontal eddy viscosity is 5 m2s?1. The\ninitial conditions for the hydrodynamic model are null free surface gradients and null velocity in all\ngrid points. For the transport model the initial conditions are salinity and water temperature fields,\nobtained by interpolation of data collected in the study area. More realistic conditions are needed\n\n\n\n8.3 Results 105\n\nfor the transport model, since the time to reach dynamic equilibrium is much longer than for tides\nand tidal currents. A value of 5 m2s?1 was adopted for both salt and heat diffusion coefficients. The\ntwo-dimensional application is fully described in Vaz et al. [2005a] and in the submitted paper Vaz\net al. [Submitted] (see Chapters 5 and 7).\n\nThe 3D model uses, at the bottom, the shear friction stress imposed assuming a velocity loga-\nrithmic profile. The vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity are computed by the model using GOTM\n(coupled to Mohid) [Burchard et al., 1999]. Coefficients of horizontal viscosity and diffusivity are set\nto 2 m2s?1. Initial conditions for the hydrodynamic model are the same of the 2D application. Initial\nconditions for the 3D transport model are constant values of salinity and water temperature (typical\nvalues for each run). At the ocean open boundary the model is forced by tide determined from 38\ntidal constituents obtained after harmonic analysis [Pawlowicz et al., 2002] of data measured at a\ntidal gauge located close to the lagoon\u2019s mouth in 2002. At the landward boundary freshwater inflow\nwas imposed, and at the arrow marked boundaries water inflow/outflow, salinity and temperature\n\nfluxes were also prescribed (Figure 8.1b). On the offshore open boundary and at the river boundary\nconstant values of salinity and water temperature were prescribed (Ssea = 36.5 and Sriver = 0, water\ntemperature varies from run to run).\n\nThe hydrodynamic was spun up from rest over 2 days (? 4 tidal cycles). This is considered a fair\nadjustment period for the hydrodynamic model. For the transport model, the spin up period is of the\norder of the lagoon\u2019s residence time. For the Espinheiro Channel, Dias [2001] found a residence time\nof 2 days (near the channel\u2019s head), and about 14 days at the northern area of the lagoon. The spin-up\nperiod is not included in the results, and the initial state of a run refers to the end of the spin-up\nperiod.\n\n8.3 Results\n\n8.3.1 Evaluation of the model results: model skill\n\nThe model results are evaluated using the Skill parameter, a statistical method presented by Wilmott\n[1981]. This method has been used recently by Li et al. [2005] and Warner et al. [2005] to assess the\nmodel results in their simulations of the Hudson River and Chesapeake Bay. The Skill parameter is\ngiven by,\n\nS kill = 1 ?\n?N\n\ni=1 |Xmod ? Xobs|2?N\ni=1(|Xmod ? Xobs| + |Xobs ? Xobs|)2\n\n(8.1)\n\nwhere X is the variable being compared, X its time mean and N is the number of measurements. This\nparameter describes the degree to which the observed deviation about the observed mean correspond\nto the modelled deviation about the observed mean. A Skill of 1.0 means a perfect agreement between\nmodel results and observations (complete disagreement yields a Skill of 0.). Model skill is evaluated\nfor all prognostic quantities.\n\n\n\n106 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\n8.3.2 Sea level height\n\nThe semidiurnal tidal constituents -M2 and S 2- explain more than 90% of the sea level variability\nin Ria de Aveiro [Dias et al., 1999], being the remaining variations caused by tidal interactions,\nlower frequency tidal and other meteorological forcings. Thus, the tidal propagation in the channel\nis dominated by the semidiurnal tide and exhibits a spring neap variation. Figure 8.2 shows the\ncomparison between observed and modelled time series of sea level height for four stations of the\nEspinheiro Channel (see Figure 8.1b). The observed sea level height was obtained in a general survey\nof the Hydrographic Institute of the Portuguese Navy in 1987 [IH, 1991].\n\nIn general, the sea level height results reveal a good qualitative agreement between model and\nobservations. At station A, the Skill is 0.93, a high value which show a good agreement near the\nmouth of the channel. As the tidal wave travels upstream the model Skill remain high with values of\n\n0.90 (station B) and 0.87 (stations C and D).\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nW\nat\n\ner\n le\n\nve\nl [\n\nm\n]\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nW\nat\n\ner\n le\n\nve\nl [\n\nm\n]\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nW\nat\n\ner\n le\n\nve\nl [\n\nm\n]\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nW\nat\n\ner\n le\n\nve\nl [\n\nm\n]\n\nTime [Hours]\n\nModel Observed \n\nStation A\n\nStation B\n\nStation C\n\nStation D\n\nFigure 8.2: Comparison between modelled and observed time series at stations A, B, C and D\nthroughout the channel.

For the M2 constituent the\ndifferences increase from 2.20? at station A to 10.08? at station D.

The averaged amplitude difference is about 5 cm (for the four stations).\nThe results presented here are confirmed by the correlation coefficient values (between observed\nand model data) which decreases upstream revealing some degradation of the results. At station A,\n\nthis coefficient is ?0.86 decreasing to ?0.77 at station D.

In fact, at station A the amplitude difference between\nmeasured and computed (using the 2D model) data is about 2.2 cm and the phase difference is lower\nthan 1?. This means that using the 3D model a lower amplitude difference (?1 cm) and a higher\nphase difference (?1.3?) are obtained. These differences in the sea level are not significantly reduced\nby changing the bottom drag coefficient, and it is not clear why they occur. The tide was imposed at\n\nthe ocean open boundary affected by a phase and amplitude correction factor for the major harmonic\nconstants (see Section 5.4). This has been done in order to assure that the model reproduces the\ntidal elevation measured at the lagoon\u2019s mouth tidal gauge. This correction was made using the\n2D numerical model previously implemented for the entire area of the lagoon and maintained for\nthis study, and could be an error source, since the curvilinear grid has high resolution and does not\nconstitute an error source. In spite these differences, the 3D model qualitatively and quantitatively\nreproduces sea level height variations within the Channel.\n\n8.3.3 Velocity\n\nIn Figure 8.3 are depicted the measured and computed time series of along flow direction velocity\n\nat station D which represent the only current velocity data available in the Espinheiro Channel.

These\nfacts originate intrinsic differences between model results and observations and may explain some of\nthe differences observed.\n\n8.3.4 Thermohaline longitudinal structure\n\nThe simulations include two spring tide periods with low and high river inflow (26/09 and\n25/11/2003) and two neaps also with high and low river inflow conditions (29/01 and 25/07/2004).\nThe tidal amplitude during spring tide was 2.8 m and during neaps was 1.3 and 1.6 m. The river inflow\nimposed at the landward boundary was 2.06 (September 2003) and 72.74 m3s?1 (November 2003),\nand for the neap simulations was 2.0 (July 2004) and 143.16 m3s?1 (January 2004). The model results\nwere compared to the thermohaline observation taken during the flood period representing synoptic\nsnapshots of the along channel salinity and water temperature distribution. These thermohaline data\nwere taken under the scope of a one year survey in which vertical profiles of thermohaline variables\nwere sampled twice a month during spring and neap tide (see Chapter 2).\n\nFigure 8.4 shows the longitudinal salinity structure through the channel longitudinal axis. In\ngeneral, the trends inferred from the observations are reproduced by the model. When the river flow\nis weak (?2 m3s?1), the salinity values near the channel\u2019s head (8 to 10 km from the mouth) are not\nwell reproduce (Figures 8.4(a, b, c) and 8.4(j, k, l)). This discrepancy may be due to the salinity initial\n\nconditions imposed in the transport model (a constant value of 35 psu within the whole channel) and\nto the low river inflow at the landward boundary which is not high enough to flush out the saline water.\nDespite these discrepancies, the best overall results were achieved using these conditions. When this\nregion\u2019s values are used, the model Skill present values between 0.44 (Figure 8.4a) and 0.86 (Figure\n\n\n\n8.3 Results 109\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nSurface\n\nskill =0.44\n\n(a)\nSa\n\nlin\nit\n\ny \n[P\n\nSU\n]\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\nMiddle\n\nskill =0.62\n\n(b)\n\n33\n\n35\n\n37\n\nBottom\n\nskill =0.66\n\n(c)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nskill =0.93\n\n(d)\n\nSa\nlin\n\nit\ny \n\n[P\nSU\n\n]\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nskill =0.87\n\n(e)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nskill =0.77\n\n(f)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nskill =0.98\n\n(g)\n\nSa\nlin\n\nit\ny \n\n[P\nSU\n\n]\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nskill =0.91\n\n(h)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nskill =0.83\n\n(i)\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nskill =0.62\n\n(j)\n\nDistance from mouth [km]\n\nSa\nlin\n\nit\ny \n\n[P\nSU\n\n]\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n30\n\n34\n\n38\n\nskill =0.86\n\n(k)\n\nDistance from mouth [km]\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n30\n\n34\n\n38\n\nskill =0.60\n\n(l)\n\nDistance from mouth [km]\n\n2\n6\n\n/0\n9\n\n/2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n5\n\n/1\n1\n\n/2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n9\n\n/0\n1\n\n/2\n0\n\n0\n4\n\n2\n5\n\n/0\n7\n\n/2\n0\n\n0\n5\n\nFigure 8.4: Comparison of longitudinal salinity distributions for observed (\u2022) and model results (line)\nat three different vertical levels for (a, b, c) 26/09/2003, (d, e, f) 25/11/2003, (g, h, i) 29/01/2004, (j,\nk, l) 25/07/2004\n\n8.4k). Using the results for the first 8 km, the model Skill increases to values near 0.9. Figures 8.4(a,\nb, c) and 8.4(j, k, l) were chosen to illustrate the difference between the tidal propagation under low\nriver flow and spring and neap tidal conditions, respectively. As it can be seen, the oceanic water\nflows further upstream (?1 km) during spring tide, due to the higher tidal prism (volume of water\nentering the channel during a tidal cycle), and the higher tidal currents. When the river flow is high\n(November and January simulations), the longitudinal salinity structure is well reproduced by the\n\nmodel, with Skill values higher than 0.75. In the surface layers (surface and mid water column), the\nmixing between oceanic and riverine waters is well calculated by the model with Skill values higher\nthan 0.85. Despite these high Skills, the longitudinal salinity distributions are underestimated by the\nmodel, mainly due to the constant freshwater inflow imposed at the landward boundary. Hence, the\npredicted vertical stratification is weaker than the observed stratification. The arrow marked boundary\nconditions (water fluxes, salinity and water temperature time series) are also very important for the\nEspinheiro Channel\u2019s results. In fact, Ria de Aveiro has several freshwater tributaries (marked in\nFigure 8.1a), and during the colder seasons, when the rainfall is higher, increasing the river inflow,\nthey are very important in the establishment of the water temperature and salinity patterns within the\nlagoon, and hence to determine the boundary conditions that are prescribed to the baroclinic model.\n\nIn Figure 8.5 are depicted the water temperature longitudinal distributions during the periods\nreferred above. The simulations were carried out imposing heat fluxes at the surface boundary. For\nthese fluxes calculations, Mohid uses the parameterizations described by Chapra [1997] (see Section\n4.5).\n\n\n\n110 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nSurface\n\nskill =0.55\n(a)\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\nMiddle\n\nskill =0.59\n(b)\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\nBottom\n\nskill =0.57\n(c)\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nskill =0.87\n\n(d)\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nskill =0.90\n\n(e)\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nskill =0.90\n\n(f)\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nskill =0.86\n\n(g)\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nskill =0.81\n\n(h)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nskill =0.73\n\n(i)\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\nskill =0.70\n\n(j)\n\nDistance from mouth [km]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\n\u00baC\n\n]\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\nskill =0.72\n\n(k)\n\nDistance from mouth [km]\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\nskill =0.59\n\n(l)\n\nDistance from mouth [km]\n\n2\n6\n\n/0\n9\n\n/2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n5\n\n/1\n1\n\n/2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n9\n\n/0\n1\n\n/2\n0\n\n0\n4\n\n2\n5\n\n/0\n7\n\n/2\n0\n\n0\n5\n\nFigure 8.5: Comparison of longitudinal water temperature distributions for observed (\u2022) and model\nresults (line) at three different vertical levels for (a, b, c) 26/09/2003, (d, e, f) 25/11/2003, (g, h, i)\n29/01/2004, (j, k, l) 25/07/2004\n\nIn general, the model reproduces well the trends inferred from the observations. When the river\nflow is weak (September and July simulations), the model underestimates the temperature distribution\nwithin the channel. The mean difference between predicted and observed values is, in general, lower\nthan 2?C, except at the surface level during the September simulation. The higher water temperature\nvalues are observed near the surface due to the water/near atmosphere heat exchanges. Near the chan-\nnel\u2019s head, the water temperature values is also controlled by the fluvial water temperature, which is\nhigher during the Summer periods. When the river flow is high (November and January simulations),\nthe water temperature distribution within the channel is mainly controlled by the mixing between\noceanic and riverine waters, being the surface fluxes less important in the calculations. The general\ntrends are well reproduced by the model, with a Skill around 0.9 and 0.8 during the November and\nJanuary simulations, respectively. During the January simulation, the water temperature distribution\nis highly dominated by the freshwater inflow from the landward boundary, and the model underesti-\nmates the temperature distribution. As previously referred, the boundary conditions prescribed at the\n\narrow marked locations (see Figure 8.1b) may also affect the amount of salt or brackish water that\nenters in Espinheiro Channel. In fact, during the Autumn and Winter, when the rainfall is high and\nthe freshwater inflow increases at the Ria de Aveiro major tributaries, the thermohaline distributions\nare affected by water exchanges between Espinheiro and the other channels of the lagoon. The fresh\nand brackish water increases within the lagoon and hence in the Espinheiro Channel.\n\n\n\n8.3 Results 111\n\n8.3.5 Characteristics of the residual circulation\n\nSuperimposed on the back-and-forth water flow there is an averaged steady water motion, known as\nresidual circulation. This circulation has a time scale similar to the tidal cycle time scale, and an\namplitude which is typically one or two orders of magnitude lower than that of the tidal currents.\nIn spite of its small amplitude, the residual circulation can determine the long-term transport which\nis very important in the ecological systems. There are two different approaches to determine the\nresidual circulation using numerical models: The first is filtering or time averaging the transient\nsolution computed by the model, and the second is solving numerically the residual velocity evolution\nequations, which are obtained by time averaging the transient velocity evolution equations. Neves\n[1985] shows that both methods are physically equivalent and give the same results. In this study is\nused the first approach.\n\nResidual circulation was calculated for each simulation period at two different levels: near the sur-\nface (Figures 8.6a and 8.7a) and near the bottom layer (Figures 8.6b and 8.7b). The results presented\nhere represent the residual flow driven by tides and freshwater during the spring tides of September\n26th (river flow of 2.06 m3s?1) and November 25th (river flow of 72.74 m3s?1). The residual values\nwere calculated by tidally averaging the transient solution computed by the model and are about one\norder of magnitude lower than the tidal currents within Espinheiro Channel.\n\nWith no freshwater inflow, the tide induced residual currents is seaward at the surface and bottom\n\n37'41'8\u00ba 45'\n\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba 42' (a)\n\nSurface\n\n0.3 m/s\n\n37'41'8\u00ba 45'\n\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba 42' (b)\n\nBottom\n\n0.3 m/s\n\nFigure 8.6: Tidally averaged (September simulation) residual flow (a) surface and (b) bottom layers.\n\n\n\n112 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\n37'41'8\u00ba 45'\n\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba 42' (a)\n\nSurface\n\n0.4 m/s\n\n37'41'8\u00ba 45'\n\n38'\n\n40'\n\n40\u00ba 42' (b)\n\nBottom\n\n0.4 m/s\n\nFigure 8.7: Tidally averaged (November simulation) residual flow (a) surface and (b) bottom layers.\n\nlayers, revealing an ebb-dominated channel (not shown). This channel feature was demonstrated by\n\nDias [2001]. In that study, a depth-integrated numerical model was used to capture the barotropic\nresidual circulation within Ria de Aveiro induced by tides, river inflow and winds. The results ob-\nserved are consistent with an ebb-dominated channel, the surface and near bottom current are always\ndirected seaward. However, currents show some spatial variability. The surface currents are visibly\nmore intense flowing out the estuarine water (Figures 8.6a and 8.7a). This jet-like current spreads\nover the whole channel width in almost all the channel area. However, near the inlet it is more intense\nclose to the south shore. The bottom current is also seaward but less intense. Near the mid-channel\nregion, this current is somehow variable due to interaction with the topography, as shown in Figures\n8.6b and 8.7b. The results presented in this section, have shown that the model can qualitatively cap-\nture some of the characteristics of the tidally-averaged estuarine circulation revealed in a prior study\nby Dias [2001].\n\nNear the channel\u2019s inlet, the residual currents were found more intense close to the south shore\nthan to the north shore. In order to confirm this feature, the longitudinal velocity component and\nsalinity were tidally-averaged and the results for three longitudinal sections - north and south shore\nand channel axis - at the entrance channel are depicted in Figure 8.8. The results are from the\nNovember (25/11/2003) and January (29/01/2004) simulations.\n\nThe two simulation periods compared here correspond to a spring tide (November) and a neap\n\n\n\n8.3 Results 113\n\n34  \n\n34.5\n\n35  \n\n35.5\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n?18\n\n?16\n\n?14\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nDistance to mouth [hm]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n?6.18\n\n?1.44\n\n3.31\n\n5.68\n\n8.05\n\n8.05\n\n8.05\n\n10.43\n\n8.05\n\n3.31\n\n0.94\n\n?1.44\n\n?3.81\n\n?6.18\n\n25/11/2003\n\nnorth shore\n\n(a)\n\n29.5\n\n30  \n\n30.5\n\n31  \n\n31.5\n\n32  \n\n32.5\n\n33  \n\n33.5\n\n34  \n\n34.5\n\n35  \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n?18\n\n?16\n\n?14\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nDistance to mouth [hm]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n?25.78\n?22.66\n\n?19.55\n?13.31\n\n?10.19 ?7.07\n\n?3.95\n\n?0.84\n\n2.28\n\n29/01/2004\n\nnorth shore\n(b)\n\n34  \n\n34.5\n\n35  \n\n35.5\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n\n?22\n\n?20\n\n?18\n\n?16\n\n?14\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nDistance to mouth [hm]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n?11.70\n?9.00\n\n?6.30\n\n?3.60\n\n?0.90\n\n1.80\n\n4.50\n\n7.20\n\n9.90\n\n12.60\n\n25/11/2003\nchannel axis\n(c)\n\n29.5\n\n30  \n\n30.5\n\n31  \n\n31.5\n\n32  \n\n32.5\n\n33  \n\n33.5\n\n34  \n\n34.5\n\n35  \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n\n?22\n\n?20\n\n?18\n\n?16\n\n?14\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nDistance to mouth [hm]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n?26.45\n\n?22.61?18.76\n\n?14.92\n\n?11.07\n?7.23\n\n?3.38\n\n0.46\n\n4.31\n\n8.15\n\n29/01/2004\n\nchannel axis\n(d)\n\n34  \n\n34.5\n\n35  \n\n35.5\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n?11\n\n?10\n\n?9\n\n?8\n\n?7\n\n?6\n\n?5\n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\nDistance to mouth [hm]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n?29.53\n\n?25.75\n\n?21.98\n\n?18.21\n\n?14.44\n\n?10.66\n\n?3.12\n\n?6.89\n\n25/11/2003\n\nsouth shore\n\n(e)\n\n29.5\n\n30  \n\n30.5\n\n31  \n\n31.5\n\n32  \n\n32.5\n\n33  \n\n33.5\n\n34  \n\n34.5\n\n35  \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n?11\n\n?10\n\n?9\n\n?8\n\n?7\n\n?6\n\n?5\n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\nDistance to mouth [hm]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n?39.60\n?35.30\n\n?31.00\n\n?26.70\n\n?22.40\n\n?18.10\n?13.80\n\n?9.50\n\n?5.20\n\n29/01/2004\n\nsouth shore\n\n(e)\n\nFigure 8.8: Tidally-averaged longitudinal velocity (contours, cms?1) and salinity (colour, psu) longi-\ntudinal structure at the inlet of Ria de Aveiro. The longitudinal sections are from the November and\nJanuary simulation results and were obtained at three locations: (a, b) north shore, (c, d) channel axis\nand (e, f) south shore.\n\ntide (January). In general, the results from January 29th (river flow of 143.16 m3s?1) show a strat-\nified water column in terms of salinity and longitudinal velocity due to the intense river inflow and\nmoderate tide. The results from November 25th (river flow of 72.74 m3s?1) also reveal a stratified\nwater column, but they present a more intense longitudinal gradient of longitudinal velocity due to a\nintense tide and a lower river inflow.\n\nNear the north shore during November 25th (Figure 8.8a), the longitudinal residual velocity struc-\nture presents positive (inward) values in a large portion of the longitudinal section. At this location,\nthe residual velocity presents negative values (outward) near the surface at the end of the entrance\nchannel (?1300 m from the mouth) and near the mouth. The negative residual currents near the\nmouth may be due to the river inflow and to the fact that these grid cells are close to the beginning of\nthe north jettie, which may influence the results at this location. The positive residual velocity found\nat this location is due to a very weak recirculation that can be found close to the north shore. The\n\n\n\n114 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\nJanuary 29th results show ebb residual currents at this location. The exception is near the bottom at\nthe mouth of the channel where is visible an inward residual velocity and more saline water. This\nstructure is strongly influenced by the high river inflow, which produces more intense ebb currents at\nthe entrance channel.\n\nAt the channel\u2019s axis, the model results show a more intense salinity gradient during the January\nsimulation, resulting from the more intense river inflow and moderate tidal regime (neap tide). The\nresidual currents show a two-layer structure during January 29th (Figure 8.8d), presenting ebb cur-\nrents at the top layers and flood currents near the bottom. During November 25th (Figure 8.8c), the\nresidual currents present a more visible longitudinal gradient, presenting flood (inward) values at the\nmouth and ebb (outward) values from the middle to the end of the entrance channel. The velocity\nstructure, at the central axis of the channel, is strongly affected by the intense tidal regime on the\nNovember 25th and by the high river inflow on the January 29th.\n\nAt the south shore longitudinal section, the model results present ebb residual currents on both\n\nsimulations. This negative values of the residual velocity are visible for all the water column, with\nhigher values at the top layers and decreasing toward the bottom. The influence of the freshwater\ninflow in the velocity structure is visible in Figures 8.8c and 8.8f, with intense values at the surface,\nwhere the currents are enhanced by the freshwater flow from the river. On January 29th, the residual\ncurrents near the surface are ?5 cms?1 higher than during the November 25th simulation.\n\nThe results depicted in Figure 8.8, reveal and confirm some of the results presented in this study.\nIn the performed simulations were found a preferential flow path near the south shore. During the ebb\nperiod, the estuarine waters flow preferentially closed to the south shore of the entrance channel, as\nthe results from the residual circulation illustrate.

The channel\u2019s width is about 350 m for both\nsections and they have a maximum depth of ?25 (cross-section 1) and ?13 m (cross-section 4). In\nthis section the results obtained from the model simulations referred in Section 8.3.4 are displayed and\ndiscussed. The longitudinal velocity component and salinity were averaged over two complete tidal\ncycles in order to remove the tides and reveal the characteristic features of the estuarine circulation\n[Pritchard, 1952; Hansen and Rattray, 1965].\n\nThe lateral and vertical structure of the tidally-averaged (or residual) salinity and longitudinal ve-\nlocity component is shown. Positive velocity values are referred as landward velocities and negative\nvalues as seaward values. Near the channel mouth, during low river flow periods (September and\nJuly simulations, river flow of ?2 m3s?1), the salinity structure is almost homogeneous, revealing a\nwell mixed section (see Figure 8.10a and 8.10d). However, the residual velocity pattern is different,\nwith ebb current values near the south shore decreasing toward the middle of the section and flood\ncurrent values near the north shore of the channel. During medium (Figure 8.10b) and high (Figure\n\n8.10c) river inflow events, the salinity structure present stratification through the water column but\nthe channel may be considered as laterally homogeneous in terms of salinity. During the November\nsimulation, the residual velocity presents the same patterns as at the low river inflow periods, i. e.\nebb currents near the south shore decreasing toward the center of the channel and flood currents near\nthe north shore. During the January simulation, when the river inflow is high (143.16 m3s?1), the\nresidual velocity pattern, at cross-section 1, reveals flood currents near the bottom and ebb currents at\nmid-column and near the surface, revealing a stratified water column and nearly flat isotachs through\nthe cross-section.\n\nNear the mouth of the channel, the predicted tidally-averaged salt transport corresponds to the\nsame pattern observed in the velocity, with a net upstream salt flux (positive) close to the north shore\nof the section decreasing toward the center of the channel, and presenting a net downstream salt\nflux (negative) from the middle toward the south shore of the channel. This feature is visible in\nall simulations, except for the January simulation (Figure 8.10g), where following the same pattern\nof the residual velocity the cross-section present a net upstream salt flux close to the bottom and a\ndownstream salt flux at the upper layers. During this period the gravitational circulation appears as an\nimportant mechanism for salt transport at cross-section 1. Another feature found during the analysis\nis that, in general, the salinity values are higher during the flood than during the ebb, leading to a\nlandward transport. This is the tidal cycle correlation term of the salt transport and can be important\n\nin branching and curved estuaries [Fischer et al., 1979; Banas and Hickey, 2005]. The September\nand July simulations were carried out under similar river inflow (about 2 m3s?1), and show a higher\ndown-channel salt transport during spring tide (Figure 8.10e) than during neap tide (Figure 8.10h).\nThis result is expected since the residual currents are higher during the spring tide period that has\nbeen simulated.\n\n\n\n116 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro

Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\nAt cross-section 4, located ?4 km upstream, the results reveal the same kind of patterns as near\nthe channel\u2019s mouth at cross-section 1, as shown in Figure 8.11. During September (Figure 8.11a) and\nJuly (Figure 8.11d), the salinity structure is nearly laterally and vertically homogeneous, with salinity\nvariations of the order of tenths of psu. During medium and high river inflow events (Figures 8.11b\nand 8.11c) the lateral structure is nearly homogeneous, but the vertical structure presents stratification\nwith values ranging from 30 (surface) to 32 (bottom) on the November simulation and 19 (surface)\nto 26 (bottom) on the January simulation. The residual velocity structure is similar to the one found\nat cross-section 1 for all four simulations. Ebb currents are visible from the middle of the channel\nto the south shore and flood currents are visible near the north shore. During the January simulation\n(Figure 8.11c), when the river inflow is high, the channel may be considered laterally homogeneous\nin terms of residual salinity and velocity, but present stratification with flood currents near the bottom\nand ebb currents at the top layers.\n\nThe tidally averaged salt transport corresponds to the patterns found in the velocity with land-\n\nward transport near the north shore and seaward transport near the south shore. During the January\nsimulation (Figure 8.11g), the landward transport is found near the bottom and at the top layers the\ntransport is seaward.\n\n8.3.7 Cross-sectional tidal thermohaline structure\n\nOnce the model implemented, it may be used to characterize the cross-sectional thermohaline and\nvelocity structure of the channel. In the following figures, are depicted the distributions of salinity,\nwater temperature and longitudinal velocity (u component) at the two cross sections referred in Sec-\ntion 8.3.6. The cross-sectional fields were determined for a neap tidal period with a high freshwater\ninflow (143.16 m3s?1) representing a Winter situation (January 29, 2004). The cross-sectional distri-\nbutions are representative of low water (a, b, c), mid flood (d, e, f), high water (g, h, i) and mid ebb\n(j, k, l) and are referred to the low and high water near the channel\u2019s inlet.\n\nAt cross-section 1 (Figures 8.12a, 8.12b and 8.12c, near the channel\u2019s mouth) at low water, the\nsalinity structure reveals a stratified water column, with values ranging from 26 psu at the top layers to\n30 psu near the bottom. From the bottom until mid water, the water column is almost well mixed. The\nwater temperature structure presents values of 12.1 near the surface and 12.3 near the bed, showing\na reasonably well mixed structure in terms of temperature. The along channel velocity component\ncross-sectional and vertical structures, reveal a stratified water column with more intense ebb currents\nat the top layers and less intense values from mid water until the bottom of the section.

Simulation period: 29/01/2004. River inflow: 143.16 m3s?1\n\nhomogeneity. Close to the north shore, near the bed, the values found are higher (35 psu) than close\nto the south shore (?33-34 psu). This could be related to the jetties direction, which induces a flood\nmain path near the north shore of the inlet. The water temperature cross-sectional structure reveals\nsome stratification with lower values near the surface (11.9 to 12.1?C) and higher values near the\nchannel\u2019s bed. At this time (three hours after low water), the u-velocity structure still presents ebb\n\n\n\n120 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\nvelocities at the top layer (? -0.3 ms?1). At mid-water and close to the bottom the velocity is positive\n(inward velocity), presenting values ranging from ?0.2 to ?0.6 ms?1.\n\nAt high water (Figures 8.12g, 8.12h and 8.12i), the salinity structure reveals some stratification,\nwith a top-to-bottom salinity difference of 1 psu, and reveals also lateral homogeneity. The cross-\nsectional water temperature structure shows a well mixed section with values rounding 12.1?C. The\nu-velocity structure presents flood (positive) values, presenting a velocity maximum near the surface\nof ?0.6 ms?1. Once more it is visible that at high water the water is still flowing upstream.\n\nDuring the ebb period, about 3 hours after high water, the salinity structure shows a stratified\nwater column with a top-to-bottom difference of about 3 psu. At this time, the salinity structure\nreveals an almost lateral homogeneity in terms of salinity. The section is well mixed in terms of\nwater temperature, and at this time the u-velocity presents ebb values through all the cross-section.\nThe higher values are found at the top layers enhanced by the landward water flowing from the Vouga\nRiver.\n\nOne last remark about the water temperature structure is that through all the tidal cycle lower\nvalues are found close to the surface than at the bottom layers. This is due to the colder water\ndischarged from the river and also due to a decrease of the water temperature along the afternoon and\nevening of January 29th.\n\nAt cross-section 4 (Figure 8.13), almost the same features are observed as the channel\u2019s mouth.\nHowever, at this location, the river effect is stronger than near the channel\u2019s mouth and several is-\nsues should be pointed out. At low water, the water column is highly stratified in terms of salinity.\nThe maximum and minimum values are found close to the bed (19 psu) and the surface (13 psu),\nrespectively. The cross-sectional water temperature structure is identical to the salinity structure with\na top-to-bottom difference of ?0.5?C. At this time, the u-velocity structure shows ebb and more in-\ntense values at the top layers with a maximum near the surface of ?0.6 ms?1. Near the channel\u2019s bed\nslightly flood (positive) values of 0.01 ms?1 are found.\n\nDuring the flood (Figures 8.13d, 8.13e and 8.13f, ?3 hours after low water), the salinity cross-\nsection show an highly stratified water column, with a top-to-bottom salinity difference of ?14 psu.\nSalinity values are lower near the surface than at low water, revealing the time lag between the\nminimum salinity value and water level. The cross-sectional structure of water temperature follows\nthe salinity structure, showing a stratified water column. Lower water temperature values are found\nat the top layers (?10.8?C) increasing toward the bottom until a maximum of 12.2?C. The cross-\nsectional u-velocity structure shows a maximum flood (positive) velocity at mid water (0.44 ms?1),\nand near the surface presents ebb values of -0.24 ms?1. This shows that at this time, the flood is not\nfully developed, at almost 4 km upstream of the channel\u2019s inlet, revealing the river influence in this\nmid channel station.\n\nAt high water (Figures 8.13g, 8.13h and 8.13i), the water column is stratified with a top-to-bottom\ndifference of ?6 psu. The water temperature structure follows the salinity structure, and also presents\nstratification, presenting lower values near the surface (11.9?C) and a maximum of 12.2? close to the\nchannel\u2019s bed. The u-velocity cross-sectional structure present a maximum in the middle of the water\n\n\n\n8.3 Results 121\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\nDe\npth\n\n [m\n], lo\n\nw w\nate\n\nr\nSalinity [psu]\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(a)\n\n10.8\n\n11  \n\n11.2\n\n11.4\n\n11.6\n\n11.8\n\n12  \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\nTemperature [\u00baC]\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(b)\n\n?0.8\n\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0   \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\nU velocity [ms\n?1\n]\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(c)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nDe\npth\n\n [m\n], m\n\nid \"\nood\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(d)\n\n10.8\n\n11  \n\n11.2\n\n11.4\n\n11.6\n\n11.8\n\n12  \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(e)\n\n?0.8\n\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0   \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(f)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nDe\npth\n\n [m\n], h\n\nigh\n wa\n\nter\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(g)\n\n10.8\n\n11  \n\n11.2\n\n11.4\n\n11.6\n\n11.8\n\n12  \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(h)\n\n?0.8\n\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0   \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(i)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nCross?section 4\n\nDe\npth\n\n [m\n], m\n\nid e\nbb\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(j)\n\n10.8\n\n11  \n\n11.2\n\n11.4\n\n11.6\n\n11.8\n\n12  \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\nCross?section 4\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(k)\n\n?0.8\n\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0   \n\n0.2 \n\n0.4 \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213\n\nCross?section 4\n\n29/01/2004\n\n(l)\n\nFigure 8.13: Cross-sectional distribution of salinity (a, d, g, j), water temperature (b, e, h, k) and\nlongitudinal velocity (c, f, i, l) at a mid channel station located upstream of station C (upstream\nview). Simulation period: 29/01/2004. River inflow: 143.16 m3s?1\n\ncolumn (0.32 ms?1). Near the surface, the u-velocity presents a slightly negative value of -0.04 ms?1,\nmeaning that the river flow is still dominant over tide at high water.\n\nDuring the ebb period (Figures 8.13j, 8.13k and 8.13l), the cross-sectional salinity and water\ntemperature structures show a stratified water column. The top-to-bottom salinity and water temper-\nature difference are 9 psu and 0.41?C, respectively. At this time, u-velocity cross-sectional structure\nroughly follows the salinity structure. The higher u-velocity values are found from the middle of the\n\n\n\n122 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\ncross-section toward the south shore with values of ? -0.8 ms?1. Hypothetically, this may be related\nto the channel\u2019s curvature which induces a preferential flow path close to the south shore of the chan-\nnel. At this time, the ebb is not fully developed and a u-velocity positive value is found at the central\naxis of the channel near its bed.\n\n8.3.8 Evaluating the phase difference between water level, salinity and longitudinal\nvelocity\n\nThe analysis of Figures 8.12 and 8.13, have revealed the existence of a phase difference between wa-\nter level, u-velocity and the occurrence of the maximum and minimum of salinity. In this channel, as\nin other tidal channels and estuaries, tidal elevation and velocity are not in phase, and the maximum\nand minimum salinity occur before or after high and low water. The use of a tested numerical model\nis particularly useful, not only to know the three-dimensional or longitudinal structure of a domain,\nbut also to understand how different forcing conditions affect the occurrence of maximums and min-\nimums of estuarine variables and the phase difference between them. In order to examine this phase\nlag vertical profiles of u-velocity and salinity are used, obtained at the central axis of the channel (at\nthe cross-sections previously referred), during a complete tidal cycle for the four simulation periods\ndescribed in this study.\n\n12.5 13.5 14.5 15.5 16.5 17.5 18.5 19.5 20.5 21.5 22.5 23.5 24.5 25.5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nW\na\n\nte\nr \n\nle\nv\n\ne\nl \n\n[m\n]\n\nTime [Hours]\n\n(e)\n\nLow water\n\n?0.9 ?0.5 ?0.1 0.3 0.7\n\n?25\n\n?20\n\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\nU?velocity [m/s]\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n(a)\n\n27 29 31 33\n\n?25\n\n?20\n\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\nSalinity [psu]\n\n(b)\n\n?0.8 ?0.5 ?0.2 0.1\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nU?velocity [m/s]\n\n(c)\n\n11 15 19 23\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nSalinity [psu]\n\n(d)\n\n12.5 13.5 14.5 15.5 16.5 17.5 18.5 19.5 20.5 21.5 22.5 23.5 24.5 25.5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nW\na\n\nte\nr \n\nle\nv\n\ne\nl \n\n[m\n]\n\nTime [Hours]\n\n(j)\n\nHigh water\n\n?0.9 ?0.5 ?0.1 0.3 0.7\n\n?25\n\n?20\n\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\nU?velocity [m/s]\n\nD\ne\n\np\nth\n\n [\nm\n\n]\n\n(f)\n\n34 34.5 35 35.5 36\n\n?25\n\n?20\n\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\nSalinity [psu]\n\n(g)\n\n?0.2 0 0.2 0.4\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nU?velocity [m/s]\n\n(h)\n\n27 28 29 30 31\n\n?12\n\n?10\n\n?8\n\n?6\n\n?4\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nSalinity [psu]\n\n(i)\n\nFigure 8.14: Computed vertical profiles of u-velocity and salinity at cross-section 1 (a, b, f, g) and\ncross-section 4 (c, d, h, i) central axis for January 29th 2004. Left panel: low water; right panel: high\nwater\n\nA pronounced stratification and shear velocity at both locations at low (left panel) and high water\n(right panel) is noticeable from the salinity abd velocity profiles. At low water, ebb currents are\n\nvisible at both cross-sections with a more pronounced shear at cross-section 1 (Figure 8.14a) and a\nsimilar stratification at both cross-sections. Near the surface, the longitudinal velocity present values\nof about -0.6 ms?1, decreasing toward the channel\u2019s bed. At cross-section 4 ebb currents of about\n-0.5 ms?1 are found at the top layer, decreasing towards the bottom. The salinity profiles reveal some\nstratification, with top-to-bottom salinity differences of about 2 and 5 psu at cross-sections 1 and 4,\n\n\n\n8.3 Results 123\n\nrespectively.

Dashed line: beginning\nof the flood and solid line: fully developed flood current. The velocity units are ms?1. (c) and (d)\nrepresent the minimum and maximum salinity profiles during the tidal cycle.\n\nAt cross-sections 1 and 4 (Figures 8.15a and 8.15b), the flood period begins respectively 30\nminutes and 1h 40 min after the low water. The water flow into the channel begins at the bottom layer\nand the flood is fully developed 3h 40 min after low water at both cross-sections (Figures 8.15a and\n8.15b). This long time period necessary to achieve a fully developed flood, may be due to the intense\nfreshwater inflow from the Vouga River which enhances the ebb currents at the surface and acts like a\ncountercurrent in opposition to the tidal intrusion. The maximum flood velocity is reached 4h 50min\nafter the beginning of the flood period at cross-section 1. At cross-section 4 the velocity maximum is\n\nreached after 3h 40 min after the beginning of the flood. The difference of about 1 hour, between the\ntwo maximums, is due to the influence of the high river discharge which decreases the flood velocity\nprofile at the central area of the channel.\n\nWhen the minimum (Figure 8.15c) and maximum (Figure 8.15d) salinity values are reached,\nthe salinity profiles reveal lower values at cross-section 4 where the freshwater influence is higher.\nThe salinity minimum occurs about 30 minutes after the beginning of the flood period at both cross-\nsections, revealing a time lag between the low water and the salinity minimum of ?1 hour. The\nsalinity maximums occur 50 minutes and 1 hour after the high water at cross-section 1 and 4, re-\nspectively. From the figure is also visible that when the minimums and maximums salinities are\n\n\n\n124 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\nreached, there is stratification at both cross-sections. The top-to-bottom salinity difference is lower\nat the mouth of the lagoon. This fact may be related to the lower influence of the freshwater at this\npoint and by the high velocity values, which increases turbulence and therefore increases mixing in\nthe water column.\n\nThe Espinheiro Channel dynamic is mainly influenced by the interaction of tidal forcing and\nriver inflow. From the four simulations described in this study, it is possible to characterize the phase\ndifference between tidal elevation, longitudinal velocity and the occurrence of salinity minimums and\nmaximums. In fact, changing the tidal forcing from neap to spring and imposing a low-to-high river\ninflow, slightly modifies the phase difference between these estuarine variables. For example, for the\nspring tide of November 26th when the river inflow is weak (2.06 m3s?1), the time difference between\nthe beginning of the flood and the low water is 1h 30min and less than 1h 40min at cross-sections 1\nand 4, respectively. Increasing the river inflow (72.74 m3s?1) but keeping the tidal amplitude (spring\ntide simulation of November 25), this time difference is about 1h 40min at cross-section 1. When the\n\nriver inflow changes from medium-to-high, the salinity minimum is reached after the beginning of\nthe flood: 30 minutes under high river inflow and neap tide conditions (January 29th) and 10 minutes\nunder medium river inflow and spring tide conditions (November 25th). The salinity maximums\nare reached, at both cross-sections, from 1 to 1h 20min after high water, at cross-sections 1 and 4,\nrespectively. During the two periods of medium-to-high river inflow, the maximum flood current is\nreached typically, at both locations, 1 hour before high water.\n\n8.3.9 Time evolution of tidal currents and thermohaline variables\n\nTidal currents and density (?t) time evolution were analyzed, both at the channel\u2019s inlet and at a mid\nchannel station (located at the channel\u2019s axis at the two cross-sections previously examined), during\n\ntwo tidal cycles under a tidal range of about 1.3 and 1.6 m (moderate tidal regime) and high (143.16\nm3s?1) and low (2.0 m3s?1) river inflow conditions (January 29 and July 25, 2004, respectively).\n\nDuring this high river runoff event, the ?t structure at the lower (Figure 8.16a) and mid channel\nstation (Figure 8.16b) is similar. However, at the lower channel station (near the channel\u2019s inlet), ?t\nvalues range from 20 kgm?3 close to the surface during low water to 26 kgm?3 during high water. The\npycnocline is visible at mid-depth after the low water hour. The isopycnals are slightly downward\ntilted during the ebb and flood periods, presenting a constant value of 26 during the hours around\nhigh water. At the mid channel station, during the period from mid ebb tide to mid flood tide, the ?t\npattern reveal some stratification (revealed by the slightly tilted isolines). The pycnocline is visible\nduring the low water at mid-depth. The ?t patterns follow the tidal propagation increasing during\nthe flood and decreasing during the ebb. The tidal velocity pattern is also similar at both stations,\nalso following the tidal pattern: positive during flood tide and negative during ebb tide. At the lower\nchannel station (Figure 8.16c), the isotachs are slightly downward tilted, presenting more intense\nvalues near the surface (-1.0 ms?1) where the ebb currents are enhanced by the river discharge which\ntransport less saline water through the channel until the shelf. The flood tidal currents present a\n\n\n\n8.3 Results 125\n\n?22.5\n\n?18.0\n\n?13.5\n\n?9.0 \n\n?4.5 \n\nLower channel station\nD\n\nep\nth\n\n [m\n]\n\n(a)\n\n?10.4\n\n?8.3 \n\n?6.2 \n\n?4.1 \n\n?2.1 \n\nMid channel station\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n(b)\n\nSi\ngm\n\na?\nt\n\n7.0 \n\n10.0\n\n13.0\n\n16.0\n\n19.0\n\n22.0\n\n25.0\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\n?22.5\n\n?18.0\n\n?13.5\n\n?9.0 \n\n?4.5 \n\nTime [hours]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n(c)\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\n?10.4\n\n?8.3 \n\n?6.2 \n\n?4.1 \n\n?2.1 \n\nTime [hours]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n(d)\n\nU\n v\n\nel\noc\n\nity\n [m\n\ns?\n1 ]\n\n?1.0\n\n?0.5\n\n0.0 \n\n0.5 \n\n1.0 \n\nL H L H L LH H\n\nFigure 8.16: Time evolution of the isopycnals (?t) and tidal currents calculated at two stations under\nneap tide conditions on January 29, 2004: near the channel\u2019s inlet (a, c) and 1 km upstream of station\nC (b, d). The river inflow imposed at the landward boundary is 143.16 m3s?1. L and H are referred\nas low and high water.\n\nmaximum of 0.9 ms?1. At the mid channel station (Figure 8.16d), the ebb currents are similar to the\nones near channel\u2019s inlet (maximum of -1.0 ms?1), but the flood tidal currents are lower (maximum of\n0.5 ms?1). At this location the river discharge effect is higher, filling the water column with brackish\nwater (the exception is during high water), turning the flood currents lower.\n\nIn Figure 8.17 the density and tidal velocities patterns for the July 25 simulation are depicted.\nDuring the low river flow period of July 25, at the lower channel station (Figure 8.17a), the ?t\n\npatterns reveal an apparent stratification. However, at this location, ?t range from 25.6 near the\nsurface to 26 kgm?3 near the bottom, revealing a well mixed water column. At the mid channel\nstation (Figure 8.17b), the water column reveal some stratification around the low water with ?t\nvalues ranging from 25 to 26 kgm?3. During the flood tide, the water column becomes well mixed\nwith ?t values of ? 26 kgm?3. The current velocity structure is similar at both stations (Figures 8.17c\nand 8.17d). The isotachs are nearly vertical, following the tidal propagation pattern: negative during\nebb tide turning positive during the flood tide. The ebb and flood maximums are lower at the mid\nchannel station. Near the channel\u2019s inlet the tidal velocity range from -0.8 to 0.8 ms?1 during ebb and\nflood tide, respectively. At the mid channel station, the ebb currents present a maximum of -0.7 and\nthe flood currents a maximum of 0.4 ms?1.\n\nIn general, the tidal evolution of the thermohaline properties and of the tidal velocity reveal a\nslight partially mixed mixed water column. This can be due to the high tidal currents which increase\nthe turbulence near the channel\u2019s bed, and, hence, the water column mixing. This is visible during the\n\nhigh river inflow event, when during the ebb tide the whole water column is progressively filled with\nfreshwater, and conversely with salt water during the flood tide. These results reveal an asymmetry\n\n\n\n126 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\n?22.5\n\n?18.0\n\n?13.5\n\n?9.0 \n\n?4.5 \n\nLower channel station\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n(a)\n\n?10.4\n\n?8.3 \n\n?6.2 \n\n?4.1 \n\n?2.1 \n\nMid channel station\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n(b)\n\nSi\ngm\n\na?\nt\n\n25.0\n\n25.2\n\n25.4\n\n25.6\n\n25.8\n\n26.0\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\n?22.5\n\n?18.0\n\n?13.5\n\n?9.0 \n\n?4.5 \n\nTime [hours]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n(c)\n\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\n?10.4\n\n?8.3 \n\n?6.2 \n\n?4.1 \n\n?2.1 \n\nTime [hours]\n\nD\nep\n\nth\n [m\n\n]\n\n(d)\n\nU\n v\n\nel\noc\n\nity\n [m\n\ns?\n1 ]\n\n?0.8\n\n?0.4\n\n0.0 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.8 \n\nL L HH L LH H\n\nFigure 8.17: Tidal evolution of the isopycnals (?t) and tidal currents calculated at two stations under\nneap tide conditions on July 25, 2004: near the channel\u2019s inlet (a, c) and 1 km upstream of station C\n(b, d).

This number\nexpresses the ratio of the gain of potential energy due to the freshwater discharge to the mixing\npower of tidal currents, and it is defined as\n\nRiE = g\n(\n??\n\n?\n\n)(\nQ f\n\nbU 3rms\n\n)\n(8.2)\n\nwhere Q f is the river inflow, b is the width of the section where the data were taken, ?? is the density\ndifference between sea and freshwater, ? is the mean density and Urms is the root-mean-square tidal\nvelocity. According to Fischer [1972] and Fischer et al. [1979], if RiE is greater than 0.8 the estuary\nis considered highly stratified, if it is smaller than 0.08 the estuary is considered well mixed and\nfinally, if 0.08 &lt;RiE &lt;0.8 the the estuary is considered partially mixed. Moreover, the water column\nstability was analyzed using the Brunt-Va?isa?la? frequency (N) (or buoyancy frequency) [Pond and\nPickard, 1983], calculated at the two locations previously referred. N is defined as\n\nN =\n(\ng\n?\n\n??t\n?z\n\n)1/2\n(8.3)\n\n\n\n8.3 Results 127\n\nwhere ? is the density, ?t is the density at atmospheric pressure (1000 kgm?3) and z is the depth\nmeasured from the surface. The results for the four simulations performed as well as the hydrographic\nconditions are presented in Table 8.2.\n\nTable 8.2: Estuarine Richardson number (RiE ) and maximum Brunt-Va?isa?la? frequency (Nmax) as a\nfunction of the tidal range and river inflow at the lower channel station (LC) and mid channel station\n(MD)\n\nDate Tidal range River inflow Station RiE Nmax\n[m] [m3s?1] [min?1]\n\n26/09/2003 2.8 2.06 LC 0.001 0.56\nMD 0.005 0.72\n\n25/11/2003 2.8 72.74 LC 0.050 0.93\nMD 0.180 1.87\n\n29/01/2004 1.3 143.16 LC 0.950 1.71\nMD 2.597 3.84\n\n25/07/2004 1.6 2.00 LC 0.010 0.69\nMD 0.054 0.97\n\nAccording to the results presented in Table 8.2, when the river flow is weak, the Espinheiro\nChannel behaves as a well mixed estuary at the lower channel area (independently of the tidal regime),\nchanging to highly stratified when the river flow is very high and during neap tide. Even during a\nhigh river inflow event (November, 25) but under spring tide conditions (tidal range of 2.8 m, and\nhigher tidal velocities), this channel area behaves as a well mixed estuary. At the mid channel area,\nthe Espinheiro Channel changes from well mixed to highly stratified depending on the river inflow.\nIn fact, when the river inflow is weak this area is considered as a well mixed estuary independently\non the tidal regime. When the river inflow increases, this area changes from partially stratified under\nspring tide conditions to highly stratified under neap and high river inflow. The characteristics of the\nwhole flow have been analyzed using RiE . This information can be complemented by means of the\nBrunt-Va?isa?la? frequency calculated at the two locations previously referred. Figure 8.18 depicts the\nBrunt-Va?isa?la? values as a function of the layer\u2019s depth for both locations under high (Figure 8.18a)\nand low river inflow (Figure 8.18b).\n\nBoth figures show high values of N near the surface layers and low values near the channel\u2019s\nbed, indicating a more stratified water column near the surface and more homogeneous near the bed\nfor the two channel locations analyzed. The overall N is higher at the mid channel station due to\nthe freshwater effect at this location. Figure 8.18b reveals lower values of N than in Figure 8.18a\n\nboth close to the surface and the bed. This is due to the almost negligible river inflow, which at this\nlocation make the water column well mixed. On both cases, the lower values of N were found at the\nlower channel station where the highest tidal velocities were found. In general, these model results\ndo not illustrate the existence of a a visible pycnocline, being more visible a monotonic decrease of N\ntoward the channel\u2019s bed. This fact may indicate an overestimated mixing of the water column. Only\nunder a high river runoff event, a pycnocline is visible at a depth of ? 2.5 (lower channel station)\nand ? 1.04 m (mid channel station). In this case, the maximum Brunt-Va?isa?la? frequency ranges from\n1.71 to 3.84 min?1 at the lower and mid channel stations, respectively.\n\n\n\n128 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n?25\n\n?20\n\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\nN [min\n?1\n]\n\nL\na\ny\ne\nr \nd\ne\np\nt\nh\n [\nm\n]\n\n(a)\n\n0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n?25\n\n?20\n\n?15\n\n?10\n\n?5\n\n0\n\nN [min\n?1\n]\n\nL\na\ny\ne\nr \nd\ne\np\nth\n [\nm\n]\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 8.18: Brunt-Va?isa?la? frequency (N [m?1]) as a function of layer depth [m] on January 29 (a)\nand on July 25, 2004 (b).

The first part of this study show a comparison of model\nresults with field measurements in order to check the model\u2019s capacity in reproducing hydrodynamic\nand thermohaline measurements. Then, it was tried to find some of the channel\u2019s features, as the\nresidual circulation, cross-sectional vertical structure of the channel, the tidal evolution of thermoha-\nline variables and the estuarine stratification. For that purpose four short periods of time (4 days) it\nwere chosen during different tidal ranges (spring and neap tides) and freshwater inflow (low-to-high\nriver runoff) in order to perform hindcast simulations.\n\nThe baroclinic model reproduces the observed temporal variability in sea level height and current\nvelocity. For the sea level height, the Skill coefficient ranged from 0.93 at station A to 0.87 at station\nD. For the along channel velocity, this coefficient presents a value of 0.84. This Skill value may\nbe due to the fact that model results are related to the averaged value over the horizontal spatial\ndomain corresponding to a grid cell, while the field data is the value at a single point. In general,\nthe baroclinic model reproduces the along-channel thermohaline distributions. Although the Skill\ncoefficient presents higher values during high river runoff conditions, the model can also reproduce\nthe thermohaline distributions when the river flow is weak (September and July simulations). The\noverall results were influenced by the thermohaline patterns near the channel\u2019s head. In fact, at\nthis location, the model could not reproduce well the thermohaline distributions under low river\nrunoff conditions (September and July simulations), presenting values different from those observed,\nespecially when we took into account the salinity results. When the river inflow is high (November\nand January simulations), the model tends to underpredict the observed salinity pattern. This can\nbe due to the high current velocity within the channel which tends to increase the turbulence and\nhence the vertical mixing and to the chosen landward boundary condition which presents a constant\n\n\n\n8.4 Discussion and conclusions 129\n\nvalue during the simulations. In general, the along-channel water temperature distributions were\nreproduced by the model, with differences in the order of 1-2 ?C.\n\nThe residual currents were also examined. The general characteristics within the domain are those\nof an ebb-dominated channel, revealing a more intense current near the surface due to the freshwater\ninflow. Another feature found, from the analysis of the residual circulation at the entrance channel\nof Ria de Aveiro, is that near the north shore of the channel\u2019s inlet the residual currents present very\nweak positive (inward) values, revealing a residual recirculation at this location. Near the south shore\nthe residual currents present negative (outward) values. This may suggest that, at the entrance channel\nof the lagoon, the water flow during ebb has a preferential path near the south shore of the channel\u2019s\nentrance. This preferential path during the ebb period may be related to the channel\u2019s curvature which\ninduces a flow path close to the south shore of the lagoon\u2019s inlet.\n\nThe tidally-averaged cross-sectional and vertical structure of the channel were examined at two\ncross-sections separated by ?4 km. They present similar salinity and residual velocity structures.\nUnder low-to-medium river runoff the channel is laterally homogeneous in terms of salinity. However,\nthe residual velocity structure is different, presenting landward velocities near the north shore of the\nchannel and seaward velocities at the south shore. When the river inflow is high (higher than 100\nm3s?1), the channel presents a typical estuarine behavior, with landward residual currents near the\nbottom and seaward currents at the top layers. The tidally-averaged salt transport follows the same\npatterns found in the residual currents results, presenting landward salt transport near the north shore\nand seaward salt transport near the south shore under low-to-medium river runoff. When the river\nflow is high, the landward salt transport was found near the channel\u2019s bed, being seaward at the top\nlayers.\n\nThe model was used to characterize the cross-sectional vertical structure of the channel at two\nlocations, represented by a lower channel station (near the channel\u2019s mouth) and a mid channel station\n(? 1 km upstream of station C). Near the mouth, the results reveal a well mixed structure during high\nwater turning to partially stratified during the low water. The maximum current velocities are reached\nduring the ebb, near the surface and south shore. At mid channel, the cross-sectional structure varies\nfrom weakly-to-strongly stratified from high to low water. The current velocities are lower than\nthose calculated for the channel\u2019s mouth. The model results reveal a phase difference between sea\nlevel height, current velocity and the occurrence of maximums and minimums of salinity. Near\nthe channel\u2019s mouth, and under spring tides with low-to-medium river discharge (September and\n\nNovember 2003 simulations), the time difference between low water (sea level minimum) and the\nbeginning of the flood is ?1h 40 min. This value changes on the neap tide of January 29th when the\ntime difference between low water and the beginning of the flood is ?30 minutes. This may be due\nto the moderate tidal currents (lower than 1 ms?1 near the inlet) which reverses more rapidly than\nduring spring tide.\n\nThe Espinheiro channel is an energetic tidal channel in which, the water mass dynamics is essen-\ntially driven by tides and river runoff. It is well known that the river flow, which causes an inflow of\nbuoyancy, tends to maintain stratification, and that the tidal flow due to the friction causes mixing.\n\n\n\n130 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\nSo, within the channel, at locations where the tidal currents are lower, the river flow can extend its\ninfluence producing stratification. This fact is illustrated by the results of the mid channel station.\nNear the channel\u2019s mouth, tidal currents are higher activating turbulent mixing, and generating well\nmixed conditions, except during high river runoff events when this area is partially stratified. In this\nchannel, the high tidal currents are frequently able to homogenize the water column. Near the chan-\nnel\u2019s mouth, the water exchange is mainly due to the tide, except under high river flow events when\nthe freshwater extends its influence from the channel\u2019s head to its mouth.\n\nFor simulations of an estuarine environment, the prescription of boundary conditions is critical.\nThese boundaries include the free surface, the bottom closed surface and the lateral open boundaries.\nAlthough, the density is more affected by salinity differences, in this work, it was imposed, at the\nfree surface boundary, surface fluxes in order to proper simulate the water temperature within the\nchannel. The surface wind stress was not considered, since its importance as a main driving force\nis not relevant in a narrow branched tidal channel as the Espinheiro Channel. The bottom surface\n\nrequires a drag coefficient that may vary spatially or temporally. In these simulations a constat value\nwas used, chosen from previous efforts. Scalar quantities along an open boundary are critical and\nchallenging since they involve processes beyond the study domain. As an example, in some estuaries,\nthe response of the river plume on the continental shelf to changes in freshwater inflow and wind\nconditions could be relevant.\n\nThe implementation and use of numerical models is a valuable tool that provides the spatial\nand temporal resolution of the velocity and scalar fields not accessible by observation only. In this\ndomain, future applications should be able to model the near-ocean salinity accurately in order to\nimprove the results within the channel. The model skill should be improved using a better prescription\nof boundary conditions in order to satisfy scalar and momentum fluxes across the boundaries. The\nboundary condition for bottom stress and open boundary conditions for salinity are crucial to increase\nthe model skill. Although the horizontal grid presents a high resolution, results may be improved by\nincreasing the vertical layers, especially in the region from the channel\u2019s mouth to the mid channel\nstation previously referred.\n\nThe results presented in this chapter reveal that the baroclinic model (Mohid) used to repro-\nduce the Espinheiro Channel dynamics was successfully implemented. To put in operation a three-\ndimensional model in such a complex area was a fascinating challenge. Due to the complex mor-\nphology and shallowness of the channel there were several difficulties to overcome. For each of the\n\nbaroclinic model simulations of the Espinheiro Channel it was necessary to run first the model in a 2D\n(depth-integrated) mode for the entire lagoon, in order to compute the landward boundary conditions\nto impose at the landward open boundaries. This type of nesting is computationally very expensive\nand brings some limitations to long term simulations, since the computational time is very high in\nthese cases. Other limitation is the high resolution of the horizontal grids, necessary to accurately\nresolve the physical processes within the channel. This high resolution limits the use of larger time\nsteps in order to reduce the computational time. Moreover, the shallowness of the study area does\nnot allow the use of a higher number of vertical layers in order to improve the results at the deeper\n\n\n\n8.4 Discussion and conclusions 131\n\nlocations. Nevertheless, in spite all the difficulties and limitations, the approach used during this work\nis considered suitable to produce good results on modelling studies of the Espinheiro Channel.\n\n\n\n132 Three-dimensional modelling of the Espinheiro Channel\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Ria de Aveiro has four main channels, and due to their unique characteristics they behave as\nindependent estuaries connected to a common inlet. The main purpose of this work was to study the\n\nthermohaline dynamics of one of these estuarine areas: the Espinheiro Channel, which is located in\nthe complex central area of the lagoon. To achieve this main goal two interconnected approaches\nwere used: field work and numerical modelling studies.\n\nThe field work may be considered well succeeded, since the measurements of physical parameters\nin the Espinheiro Channel increased the existent data base of hydrodynamic and hydrologic variables,\ncontributing to a better characterization of the channel\u2019s dynamic. The numerical model used in\nthis work (Mohid) reproduces adequately the major hydrodynamic features of Ria de Aveiro and of\nEspinheiro Channel in 2D depth-integrated and 3D modes, respectively. The numerical bathymetries\nof Ria de Aveiro and Espinheiro Channel were well represented by the model, which treated with\naccuracy flooding and drying of intertidal areas in such a complex study area.\n\nThe main results presented in this work reveal that the thermohaline dynamic both in Ria de\nAveiro and Espinheiro Channel is a delicate balance between tides, river inflow and meteorological\nforcings.\n\nThe one year sampling campaign of thermohaline variables in the Espinheiro Channel has pro-\nvided a major insight into its hydrographic features, revealing that the channel\u2019s hydrodynamics is\nlargely dependent on the tidal wave characteristics and freshwater inputs variability. The analysis of\nthe measured data revealed that when the river flow is low - less than 10 m3s?1 - the water column is\nfilled with salt water from the ocean until almost 8 km from the channel\u2019s mouth. When the river flow\n\nis higher than 100 m3s?1 vertical stratification is established along the channel, and the freshwater\nfrom Vouga River extends its influence up to the channel\u2019s mouth. When the river flow lies between\n30 and 50 m3s?1, the channel can be divided into three different regions: a lower marine region\nwhere the thermohaline variables present oceanic values; an intermediate inner region where mixing\nbetween ocean and river water occurs and a upper fluvial region which is dominated by freshwater\nbut is still subject to a semidiurnal tidal action.\n\nThe formation of strong salinity gradients (commonly related to estuarine fronts) was observed\n\n\n\n134 Conclusions\n\nduring the sampling period in a region between 7 and 8 km from the channel\u2019s mouth. The generation\nof these gradients is related to the interaction between salt and freshwater as well as to changes in the\nmorphology (width and depth) of the channel. It was observed that these fronts migrate within a re-\ngion of about 1 km, depending on the tidal regime: neap or spring tides. The estuarine fronts observed\nare mainly salinity fronts. The longitudinal water temperature variation within Espinheiro Channel\nis smoother than the salinity gradient. Apart from the dependence on the water temperature varia-\ntions at the channel\u2019s boundaries (ocean and river), and due to the shallowness of the several regions\nof the channel, the water temperature pattern within Espinheiro is closely related to meteorological\nvariations in air temperature, incoming solar radiation or relative humidity.\n\nThe 25 hour surveys performed near the channel\u2019s head, originated changes in the classification\nof the upper fluvial region of the Espinheiro Channel. During the cold season surveys (January and\nDecember 2004), this region presents salt wedge characteristics, with the occurrence of stratifica-\ntion/destratification events during the flood and ebb periods. On the other hand, this region presents\n\npartially mixed characteristics during June and August survey periods when the freshwater inflow is\nlower.\n\nThe balance between the seaward salt transport induced by the river discharge and the landward\ndispersion induced by various mixing mechanisms was assessed using measurements of velocity and\nsalinity, sampled during two tidal cycles, near the mouth and head of the Espinheiro Channel. The\ntotal salt transport was decomposed into 7 terms: one advective due to the freshwater discharge\n(or residual circulation) and 6 dispersive terms which acts to transport salt upstream. From this\napproach, it was found that the major contributions to the salt transport near the channel\u2019s mouth are\nthe transport due to the freshwater discharge and the tidal correlation terms, which may be correlated\nto topographic trapping. Near the channel\u2019s head, the major contributions are due to the freshwater\ndischarge and the gravitational circulation terms. In these areas, where the gravitational circulation\nterm is important, a compensating bottom current is originated to transport salt upstream, balancing\nthe salt flushed out by the river. Eventhough the short term surveys performed were too small in order\nto give insight on meteorological effects influencing salt transport, they can produce valuable results\nregarding processes on tidal and subtidal time scales as the presented in this work.\n\nThe modelling task performed throughout this work began by assessing the hydrodynamic mod-\nule of Mohid in a two-dimensional mode for all the lagoon. The model results were evaluated against\nseveral data sets of seal level height, current velocity and water flow. A good calibration and vali-\n\ndation of the hydrodynamic model was achieved, revealing its ability in reproducing the barotropic\nflows in such a complex system as Ria de Aveiro. The transport module of Mohid was also imple-\nmented in a two-dimensional mode for all the lagoon. When no meteorological forcing is imposed,\nthe longitudinal structure of water temperature in Ria de Aveiro is only affected by the sea and river-\nine water temperature, and the initial conditions suffer a major change after 12 tidal cycles (?6 days).\nImposing meteorological forcing, the water temperature pattern begins to change after 3 tidal cycles,\nrevealing the cooling effect due to exchanges between the water and the near atmosphere. The model\nresults show the Mohid\u2019s ability in reproducing field results of temporal evolution of salinity and\n\n\n\n135\n\nwater temperature. The major discrepancies were found in the water temperature results and may\nbe related to the freshwater temperature assumed as boundary condition both at the oceanic open\nboundary and at the landward boundaries. The model seems to make use of an accurate bathymetry,\nand in general, the horizontal grid resolves well the transport processes.\n\nThe water temperature and salinity horizontal patterns and their dependence on the tidal and river\ninflow forcing were also studied for the central area of Ria de Aveiro under extreme conditions of tide\nand river inflow. When the river flow is high (1000 m3s?1), the freshwater extends to the entire central\narea of Ria de Aveiro (including the coastal zone) being determinant on the establishment of the\nthermohaline patterns in the central area of the lagoon. Despite this river discharge influence, during\nthe flood the tide pushes the freshwater upstream revealing, even under extreme river flow discharge,\na salinity intrusion of almost 8 km. When the river inflow is weak (lower than 10 m3s?1), the salinity\nand water temperature horizontal structure is mainly influenced by mixing due to turbulence caused\nby the tidal propagation within the lagoon.\n\nThe three-dimensional baroclinic model of Espinheiro Channel was used to cover topics like the\nresidual circulation within the channel, with a closer look to its inlet; the cross-sectional tidally-\naveraged structure and salt transport; the cross-sectional thermohaline and tidal velocity structure of\nthe channel; the temporal evolution of density and tidal currents. The vertical structure of the channel\nwas also examined using estuarine parameters as the Richardson Number and buoyancy frequency,\nwhich are calculated from the model results.\n\nThe baroclinic model reveals its ability to qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce observations\nof sea level height, velocity and thermohaline variables. The overall results present a high skill score,\nwhen compared with observations, for almost all the channel\u2019s area. The exception is the region\nbetween 1 km upstream station D and the channel\u2019s head, a very narrow and shallow area of the\nchannel, where the model was not able to reproduce accurately the thermohaline patterns. When\nthe river flow changes from low-to-medium values, the model qualitatively reproduces the observed\nthermohaline patterns in the channel. When the river flow is higher than 100 m3s?1, the model tend\nto underpredict the observed salinity pattern. This may be due to the high current velocities within\nthe channel, which increases turbulence and hence vertical mixing. Another factor that could limit\nthe results is the constant value of river discharge imposed at the landward boundaries during the\nsimulations.\n\nThe general characteristics of the residual circulation within the domain are those of an ebb-\n\ndominated channel, revealing more intense values near the surface due to the freshwater discharge.\nFrom the analysis of the residual circulation at the entrance channel of Ria de Aveiro, was found,\nin all simulations, that near the north shore of the Channel\u2019s inlet the residual currents are positive\n(inward) values, and near the south shore the residual currents are negative (outward) values. This\nmay suggest a particular circulation pattern, with a preferential path during the flood and ebb near the\nnorth and south shore of the inlet.\n\nThe cross-sectional and vertical residual currents and salinity reveal that, under low-to-medium\nriver runoff, the channel is laterally homogeneous in terms of salinity. However, the residual velocity\n\n\n\n136 Conclusions\n\nstructure is different, presenting landward velocities near the north shore of the channel and seaward\nvelocities at the south shore. When the river inflow is high (higher than 100 m3s?1), the channel\npresents a typical estuarine behavior, with landward residual currents near the bottom and seaward\ncurrents at the top layers. The tidally-averaged salt transport follows the same patterns found in the\nresidual currents results, presenting landward salt transport near the north shore and seaward salt\ntransport near the south shore under low-to-medium river runoff. When the river flow is high, the\nlandward salt transport was found near the channel\u2019s bed, being seaward at the top layers.\n\nNear the mouth, the cross-sectional thermohaline and longitudinal velocity patterns reveal a well\nmixed structure during high water turning to partially stratified during low water. The maximum\ncurrent velocities are reached during the ebb, at the surface and south shore. At mid channel, the\ncross-sectional structure varies from weakly-to-strongly stratified from high to low water. The cur-\nrent velocities are lower than those calculated for the channel\u2019s mouth. The model results reveal\na phase difference between sea level height, current velocity and the occurrence of maximums and\n\nminimums of salinity. Near the channel\u2019s mouth, and under spring tides with low-to-medium river\ndischarge (September and November 2003 simulations), the time difference between low water (sea\nlevel minimum) and the beginning of the flood is ?1h 40 min. This value changes on the neap tide\nof January 29th when the time difference between low water and the beginning of the flood is ?30\nminutes.\n\nSampling strategies like the one followed in the data acquisition - synoptic and short term surveys\n- were chosen due to the limited instrumentation available and some logistic problems like human\nlimitations and the impossibility of performing long term measurements along the channel. In fact,\nthe measurement of salinity, water temperature and current velocity during several consecutive tidal\ncycles, and at several locations along the channel, would allow for a better assessment of the hydrog-\nraphy of the channel. Issues like the salt fluxes or the classification of the channel in terms of salinity\nand current structures would benefit of this long term data acquisition. One way to overcome the\nlack of measured data is the use of a numerical model for the Espinheiro Channel. However, this\nchannel is sinuous and has a complex geometry (a common feature within Ria de Aveiro), and the\nimplementation of the numerical model turn out to be very challenging.\n\nAn orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system was designed to follow the general orientation of the\nchannel including its major tributaries and the near coastal ocean. High resolution was used in order\nto properly resolve the physical features of the channel. Due to its location and because its hydrology\n\nis influenced by the adjacent channel\u2019s contributions, time varying fluxes of water, salinity and water\ntemperature were imposed at the boundaries between Espinheiro and the other main channels. The\napproach adopted consists on running the model in a two-dimensional mode for all the lagoon in\norder to obtain these fluxes, and then impose them as landward boundary conditions and run the\nthree-dimensional model for the Espinheiro Channel. Due to the relative small size of the grid cells\nthis approach is very time consuming, since the model is run twice (first in a 2D mode and then in\na 3D mode). Nevertheless, this kind of nesting proved to be an adequate solution to overcome the\ndifficulties on modelling the Espinheiro Channel.\n\n\n\n137\n\nIn order to perform hydrodynamic and transport simulations within estuarine environments, the\nprescription of reliable boundary conditions is essential. Besides the forcings prescribed in this study,\nin future model applications the surface wind stress should be considered and its role as a major\ndriving force assessed. Future simulations will also benefit from a bottom drag coefficient that may\nvary spatially or temporally. At the open lateral boundaries, momentum balances may be obtained\nfrom observations of river flow and tidal elevations. Scalar quantities along an open boundary are\ncritical and challenging since they evolve processes beyond the study domain. Also, future model\napplications should be able to model the near-ocean salinity accurately in order to improve the results\nwithin the channel. Although the horizontal grid present a high resolution, it should be able to\nimprove the results by increasing the vertical layers, especially in the region from the channel\u2019s\nmouth to the mid channel station previously referred.\n\nIt remains for the future several experimental studies in order to increase the knowledge about\nthermohaline dynamics in the Espinheiro Channel. It will be useful in the future to perform field\n\nsurveys that cover an entire spring-neap cycle in order to evaluate the temporal variation of the salin-\nity, water temperature and current velocity. A better spatial coverage of critical areas of the channel\n- its mouth and central area - would be a valuable contribution to better understand cross-sectional\nvariation of these estuarine variables. These field surveys should, ideally, last for at least one year\nin order to characterize the seasonal cycle of thermohaline variables within the channel. Short term\nhigh resolution - spatial and temporal - surveys of salinity and velocity are needed in order to study\nthe strong salinity gradients (estuarine fronts) identified in this work.\n\n\n\n138 Conclusions\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nAbbott, M.
