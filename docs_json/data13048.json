In this sense, docking and dynamic molecular studies were carried out in this work, aiming to acquire a deeper \nunderstanding about all the structural aspects of molecules (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-cassine and (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline \nhydrochlorides, which differ with respect to their AChE inhibitory potentials. Both molecules establish important interactions \nwith the peripheral anionic site within the catalytic gorge of Torpedo californica AChE. However, only the major compound \n(\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-cassine hydrochloride significantly interacts with the catalytic triad. Explicit-solvent molecular dynamic \nsimulations were conducted in order to gain better understanding about the hypothetical interactions taking place between \nthe semi-synthetic alkaloid molecules (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-cassine and (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline hydrochlorides and AChE. \nThe data obtained in this study indicated that (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-cassine hydrochloride is the most potent inhibitor of AChE \npossibly due to the favorable interactions of this molecule with the target protein, with lower desolvation cost. These \nresults suggested that the size of the side chain has an effect on the inhibitory potential of the evaluated molecules and \nmay represent the starting point for the development of new derivatives of (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-cassine hydrochloride, with a \nview to the discovery of new effective AChE inhibitors.\n\nKeywords: molecular docking, molecular dynamic, piperidine alkaloids, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors\n\n\n\nMolecular Docking and Molecular Dynamic Studies of Semi-Synthetic Piperidine Alkaloids J.

Currently, only \nfive drugs have received approval in the USA and Europe \nfor therapeutic use in AD, namely tacrine (1; Cognex\u2122),4 \ndonepezil (2; Aricept\u2122),5 rivastigmine (3; Excelon\u2122),6 \ngalantamine (4; Reminyl\u2122)7 and memantine (5; Ebixa\u2122)8 \n(Figure 1). All of these compounds are acetylcholinesterase \ninhibitors (AChEIs),4-7 with the single exception of 5, \nwhich acts by blocking the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) \nglutamate receptors. It is apparent, therefore, that inhibition \nof acetylcholinesterase remains an important therapeutic \nstrategy to the palliate cognitive deficit in AD.\n\nThe screening of numerous plant species that were \ntypically selected based on their ethnobotanical data \nor report of their popular uses has been carried out in \norder to discover anticholinesterasic compounds with \nnovel structural entities.9-18 In this context, flowers, \nfruits, leaves and seeds from the ornamental plant \nSenna spectabilis (syn. Cassia spectabilis) (Fabaceae) have \nbeen reported to be sources of biologically rare piperidine \nalkaloids.19 A deep analysis of the structural features of the \nnaturally-occurring (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline (6) identified \nthat part of this compound contains a molecular fragment \nsimilar to acetylcholine (ACh) (Figure 2). This has led to the \npreparation of several semi-synthetic derivatives, including \n\n(\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline hydrochloride (10), which \nwas prepared from natural piperidine (\u2013)-spectaline (8). \nThis derivative has been shown to display both in vitro \n(inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 7.32 \u00b5M) and in vivo \ncholinergic activity during the spatial memory test \n(water maze).20 Aiming to elucidate the mechanism of \ncholinesterase inhibition followed by this derivative, \nkinetic studies have revealed noncompetitive cholinesterase \ninhibition and central nervous selectivity with few peripheral  \nside effects.21\n\nConsidering these results, compound 10 was selected \nas a prototype for further studies aiming to achieve \na lead molecule. Additional scale-up fractionation of \nS. spectabilis and further isolation of the natural alkaloid \n8 were monitored by electrospray ionization mass \nspectrometry (ESI-MS). This investigation revealed that \nthe previously published piperidine alkaloids were in fact \nmixtures of two homologous piperidine alkaloid isomers \n(\u2013)-cassine (7) and (\u2013)-spectaline (8) at a ratio of 4:1, \nrespectively (Figure 2).22 So, the cholinesterase inhibition \nproperties identified in that study were due to the mixture \nof (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-cassine hydrochloride (9) and 10 instead \nof being due to only the latter compound.\n\nIn spite of this problem, the main aim of this \nstudy was to investigate the binding patterns of the \nderivatives 9 and 10 with AChE and to verify the possible \ndifferences in their inhibition profiles. Molecular \nmodeling studies of complexes formed between Torpedo \ncalifornica acetylcholinesterase (TcAChE) and the target \nsemi-synthetic AChE inhibitors were accomplished by \nthe application of flexible docking methodologies. The \ndocking complexes were also submitted to explicit-solvent \nmolecular dynamic (MD) simulations in water in order to \ngain dynamic understanding of the hypothetic interactions \ntaking place between the molecules and AChE.\n\nN\n\nNH2\n\nO N\n\nO\n\nCH3\n\nCH3\n\nCH3\n\nN\n\nCH3\n\nCH3\n\nH3CO\n\nH3CO\n\nO\n\nN\n\nO\n\nN\n\nCH3\n\nH3CO\n\nH3C\n\nCH3\n\nNH2\n\n1 2\n\n3 4 5\n\nOH\n\nFigure 1.

Such knowledge can be \nexploited during the design of novel AChE inhibitors that \nmight be more effective in the treatment of AD.26-30\n\nMethodology\n\nMolecular docking analyses\n\nThe accurate prediction of protein-ligand interaction \ngeometries is essential for the success of the virtual-screening \napproaches employed during structure-based drug design. \nThis procedure requires docking tools that are able to \ngenerate suitable conformations of a ligand within a \nprotein-binding site and demands reliable energetic \nevaluations for the quality determination of the interaction. \nIn this respect, the FlexXTM scoring function has been \nshown to be reliable in a variety of different cases, even \nwhen flexible ligands are concerned.31 Thus, in the present \nstudy, docking with FlexE was performed using the default \nFlexXTM scoring function following the preparation of both \nthe ligand and the protein.\n\nMolecular docking analyses were accomplished by \nusing the SYBYL 9 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) \nversion 7.2 software and the programs embedded therein. \nFormal charges were assigned, and the FlexX scoring \nfunction31 was chosen for computation of the FlexE32 \ndocking poses.\n\nPreparation of ligands for the docking studies\n\nLigand coordinates were generated using the sketcher \ntool embedded in the SYBYL software suite, and the \ncorrect atom types (including hybridization states) and \nbond categories were defined. Hydrogen atoms were \nsubsequently added, Gasteiger-H\u00fcckel charges33 were \nassigned to each atom, and the final structures were \nenergy-minimized. Carboxylic acid groups were modeled \nin their anionic form, whereas amino groups were \nconsidered in their protonated form.\n\nPreparation of protein structures for the docking studies\n\nThree-dimensional crystal structures of TcAChE \ncomplexed with huperzine, tacrine and donepezil were \nretrieved from the RCSB (Research Collaboratory for \nStructural Bioinformatics) protein data bank34 under \nPDB IDs 1VOT, 1ACJ and 1EVE, respectively. The active \nsite of TcAChE was defined as the collection of residues \nwithin 15.0 \u00c5 of the bound inhibitor present in the reference \nstructure 1ACJ. The bound inhibitors were not included in \nthe docking runs.\n\nFor each structure, the description of an ensemble \ncontains the definition of the protein atoms (via chain \nidentifiers and hetero groups), the resolution of ambiguities in \nthe PDB file (alternate location indicators etc.), the location \nof hydrogen atoms at the heteroatoms and the definition \nof the active site atoms. The first step in the generation of \nsuitable protein structures for ensemble superimposition \nis the selection of one chain from the reference crystal \nstructure (1ACJ). This process generally involves retention \nof chain A and deletion of other chains, if present.\n\nN\nCH3\n\nO\n\nH3C\n\nO\n\n9\n\nH3C\n\nO\nN\n\nCH3\n\nO\n\nCH3\n\nH3C\n\nO\n\nACh\nCH3\n\nN\nCH3\n\nO\n\nH3C\n\nHO\n\nH\n\nn\n\n7: n = 7\n8: n = 9\n\n6\n\nsimilarity\n\nN\nCH3\n\nO\n\nH3C\n\nO\n\nH\n\nn\n\nH3C\n\nO\n\n9: n = 7\n10: n = 9\n\nHCl\n\n(i) HCl\n\n(ii) AcCl, CHCl3, 70 \noC, 8 h\n\n95%\n\nH\n\nFigure 2.

Charges were added according to \nthe AmberF99 force field simulation.35 The side-chains \nof lysine and arginine, and the carboxylate groups of \naspartic and glutamic acids, were modeled in their ionized \nstates. Water molecules contained in the PDB file were \nremoved. After each docking run, thirty poses were saved \nin Mol2 files for further analysis.\n\nLigand topologies\n\nThe structure of each compound was submitted to the \nPRODRG Server,36 and the initial geometries and crude \ntopologies were retrieved on the basis of the best ranking \ndocking poses previously obtained by flexible docking with \nFlexE. The employed atomic charges were derived from \nthe L\u00f6wdin scheme and were obtained at the HF/6-31G** \nlevel using the program GAMESS37 in an appropriated \nform for molecular dynamic calculations. Analyses were \ncarried out using the GROMACS simulation suite38 and \nthe GROMOS96 force field, as previously reported.39-41\n\nMolecular dynamic simulations\n\nThree systems were submitted to molecular dynamic \n(MD) simulations: (i) uncomplexed AChE in solution, \n(ii) AChE complexed with 9 and (iii) AChE complexed with \n10. The GROMACS simulations suite and GROMOS96 \nforce field were used by employing an MD protocol based \non previous studies.42 Briefly, these systems were solvated \nin triclinic boxes using periodic boundary conditions and \nthe SPC water model.43 Counter ions were added, so \nas to neutralize the charges of the systems. The LINCS \nmethod44 was applied in order to constrain covalent bond \nlengths. This allowed for an integration step of 2 fs after an \ninitial energy minimization step using the steepest descent \nalgorithm. Electrostatic interactions were calculated with \nparticle-mesh Ewald.45 Temperature and pressure were kept \nconstant by separately coupling protein, ligand, ions, and \nsolvent to external temperature and pressure baths with \nconstants of ? = 0.1 and 0.5 ps, respectively.46 The system \nwas slowly heated from 50 to 310 K in steps of 5 ps, each \none increasing the reference temperature by 50 K. After this \n\nthermalization, the reference temperature was maintained \nat 310 K. Interaction energies are presented as the sum \nof Coulomb and Lennard-Jones components over the \nentire MD trajectories. Ranked data were evaluated using \nKruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),47 \nwhereas pairwise multiple comparisons were assessed \nby the Tukey test.48 Between-group comparisons were \nappraised with the Mann-Whitney rank sum test.49,50\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nEnzyme-inhibitor interactions at the bottom of the AChE \ngorge\n\nThe visual inspection of the ligand-TcAChE complexes \n(Figures 3a-b) shows that the bottom of the active site gorge \nof AChE may be represented by amino acid residue Trp84. \nThe evaluation of the best ranking docking poses obtained \nfor 9 and 10 revealed that neither of these molecules was \n\nFigure 3.

Presumably, \nthis is a consequence of the volume of the long aliphatic \nside chains present in the two compounds. However, unlike \nits homologue 10, acetyl hydrochloride derivative 9 was \nable to interact with one of the residues, hence forming \nthe AChE catalytic triad (i.e., Ser200, Glu327 and His440) \nthrough formation of a hydrogen bond linking the terminal \noxygen atom of its acetyl group with Ser200.\n\nEnzyme-inhibitor interactions in the middle of the AChE \ngorge\n\nA constriction is located within the region considered \nto be the middle of the AChE active site gorge and is \nrepresented by amino acid residue Phe330 (Figures 3a-b). \nHowever, neither 9 nor 10 appear to interact with Phe330, \nalthough a binding site with 9 is located relatively close to \nthis residue (Figure 3a).\n\nEnzyme-inhibitor interactions at the entrance to the AChE \ngorge\n\nAmino acid residues, including Tyr70, Tyr121 and \nTrp279, making up the peripheral anionic site of AChE \nare located close to the top of the active site gorge. The \nvisual inspection of the top scoring pose of 9 reveals that \nthe piperidine ring and the aromatic rings of Phe288 and \nPhe290 are within van der Waals contact distance \n(Figure 3a). Additionally, 9 is able to form hydrogen bonds \nwith the \u2013NH group of Phe288 via the ester function, \nwith Gly118, Gly119 and Ala201 via the oxygen of the \nterminal acetyl group, and with Tyr121 via the hydrogen \natom associated with the protonated amino group of the \npiperidine moiety (Figure 3a). In contrast, 10 can establish \nhydrogen bonds with Lys341 via the ester function, with \nPro76 via the protonated nitrogen atom of the piperidine \nring, and with Asn85 via the terminal acetyl group. It is \nnoteworthy that, as compared to 9, 10 binds to AChE in \na perpendicular fashion, with an extended conformation \n(Figures 3a-b). Binding of compounds 9 and 10 to the \nperipheral anionic site of AChE is likely to generate a steric \nblockade of the enzyme gorge similar to that described \nfor the anticholinesterasic drug donepezil, which presents \nanalogous binding characteristics.25\n\nMolecular dynamics stimulations\n\nIn order to obtain further information regarding the \ndynamics of AChE inhibition by 9 and 10, complexes \nbetween the enzyme and the semi-synthetic derivatives \nwere submitted to MD simulations in water.

Both compounds \nunderwent significant reorientations in the simulated time \nscale, indicating an important role for the solvent with \nrespect to the flexibility and stabilization of the complexes. \nHowever, such conformational accommodations did not \nappear to induce major modification in AChE dynamics or \nsecondary structural elements (Supplementary Information, \ndata available).\n\nMD simulation revealed interactions between both \nmolecules 9 and 10 and the amino acid residue Trp84 at the \nbottom of the enzyme gorge, although the binding energy of \n9 with this residue (\u20137.7 \u00b1 6.5 kJ mol-1) was more favorable \nthan that of 10 (\u20131.9 \u00b1 2.6 kJ mol-1) (Table 1). In the middle \nof the gorge, both 9 and 10 interacted with Trp432, which \nlies in a region close to the amino acid residue Phe330. At \nthe top of the gorge, 9 exhibited binding with Tyr70 and \nAsp72, and exhibited a very favorable interaction with the \nlatter residue with a binding energy of \u201313.7 \u00b1 10.0 kJ mol-1. \nClose to this region of the gorge, derivative 9 also interacted \nwith Tyr121 and Ser122. Although 10 did not bind with these \nresidues, it interacts with residues Gln74, Asp285, Ser286, \nArg289, Tyr334 and Gly335 (Table 1).\n\nTable 1.

The \ndata suggest that the increase in hydrophobicity of 10 \nas compared to 9 culminates in a greater entropic cost \nassociated with the complexation of the former.\n\nMD simulation of the AChE-inhibitor docking \ncomplexes AChE-9 and AChE-10 generated interaction \nenergies of \u201334.0 \u00b1 15.1 and \u201330.9 \u00b1 17.7 kJ mol-1, \nrespectively (Table 1). The application of the Mann-Whitney \nrank sum test established that these values are statistically \ndifferent (p ? 0.001), a result that correlates with the \nobserved differences in the biological activities of 9 and \n10. Similarly, the observed interaction energies between \nuncomplexed 9 and 10 and solvent water may be readily \nrelated to the enthalpic cost of desolvation associated \nwith inhibition of AChE by these molecules. Therefore, \nthe more active structure 9 may be seen as presenting a \nmore favorable interaction with the target protein and as \nbeing held with lower intensity by the solvent. On the other \nhand, the less active compound 10 exhibits a less favorable \ninteraction with the target receptor and a more intense \ninteraction with the solvent.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe molecular modeling study described herein was \ncarried out with the aim of elucidating the molecular \nbasis of the differential AChE inhibition profiles of \ntwo semi-synthetic acetyl derivatives of the piperidine \nalkaloids (\u2013)-cassine and (\u2013)-spectaline isolated from \nS. spectabilis. Flexible docking revealed different binding \nconformations and interaction patterns for (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-\ncassine hydrochloride (9) and (\u2013)-3-O-acetyl-spectaline \nhydrochloride (10) with respect to AChE, especially in \nthe peripheral anionic site. Explicit-solvent molecular \ndynamic simulations in water revealed that the more active \ncompound 9 presents a more favorable interaction with \nthe target protein, as anticipated by flexible docking, at a \nlower desolvation cost. On the other hand, the less active \ncompound 10 exhibits a less favorable interaction with \nthe enzyme along with a more intense interaction with the \nsolvent. These results emphasize the importance of the \nshorter side chain of 9 for a better interaction with AChE. \nThis is due to reduced steric limitations to the entry of the \ninhibitor into the active site gorge. This finding will be \nable to guide the design of new derivatives of 9, e.g., via \nshortening of the side chain bearing different functionalities, \naiming at the synthesis of anti-Alzheimer lead compounds \nbased on natural products from our Brazilian biodiversity.\n\n\n\nDanuello et al. 169Vol. 23, No. 1, 2012\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary information (Figures S1-S7) are \navailable free of charge at http://jbcs.org.br as a PDF  \nfile.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research was supported by a grant (No. 03/02176-7) \nawarded to V.
