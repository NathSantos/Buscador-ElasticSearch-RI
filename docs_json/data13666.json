Thirty?six male pigs were housed in individual \nmetabolic cages. Total collection of feces and urine was carried out \nin two periods of ten days: five days for adaptation and five days \nfor collection. A randomized blocks design was used, considering \nthe sampling period as a block, with five treatments and seven \nreplicates. Two control diets (with and without phytase ? Phy) \nwere used in the digestibility calculations, the latter in order to \nevaluate the enzyme influence on energy digestibility of the tested \ningredients. The control diet was replaced by 30% of one of the \ningredients: defatted rice bran (DRB) with and without Phy \nand dephytinised defatted rice bran (DDRB). The use of Phy in \nthe control diet did not influence DRB+Phy energy digestibility. \nRelative to DRB+Phy, dephytinised defatted rice bran had higher \ncontents of ME and digestible protein but lower digestible P and \nCa. Phy supplementation increased Ca and P utilization of DRB \nand improved energy and protein digestibility. The DRB without \nPhy showed the lowest digestibility coefficients for all responses. \nMetabolizable energy, digestible protein, phosphorus and calcium \nof DRB, DRB+Phy and DDRB were respectively, 2140, 2288 and \n2519kcal kg-1; 79.25, 92.41 and 107.10g kg-1; 1.62, 3.41, and \n2.11g kg-1 and 2.80, 3.79 and 2.90g kg-1.\n\nKey words: alternative ingredients, dephytinization, enzyme, \nnutrients.\n\nRESUMO\n\nO objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar o valor \nnutricional e energ\u00e9tico de subprodutos do arroz, na presen\u00e7a \nou n\u00e3o de fitase, para su\u00ednos em crescimento.

However, 60 to \n80% of P is in the form of phytate (SELLE et al., \n2011); hence, the bioavailability of this P is low \nin pigs.  Defatted rice bran contains high levels of \ncrude protein (15.3%) and P (1.89%) (ROSTAGNO \n\nIDepartamento de Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o e Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Animal, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), 13635-900, Pirassununga, SP, Brasil.

However, about 85% of the total P is \nunavailable to non-ruminant animals as it is bound up \nin phytate (ROSTAGNO et al., 2011). This impairs \nP absorption by pigs and facilitates chelation with \nother minerals. Previous research by HASTAD et al. \n(2005) determined that some varieties of low-phytate \ncorn had a greater energy content compared with \nconventional varieties. \n\nThe use of phytase (Phy) to increase \nthe use of phytic acid is already known in the \nmonogastric feed industry. Phytase catalyzes the \nhydrolytic degradation of phytic acid (myo-inositol \nhexaphosphate) and its salts (phytate), resulting \nin inositol, inositol monophosphate and inorganic \nphosphate (MULLANEY et al., 2000). According \nto LIAO et al. (2002), phytate may decrease starch \ndigestibility by several mechanisms. Supplementation \nof phytase may release starch and ?-amylase, thereby \nincreasing the digestible energy content of the diets.\n\nBesides the use of phytase, phytic \nacid removal from vegetable ingredients through \nindustrial processes and/or laboratory methods \nhave been employed successfully by SERVI et al. \n(2008) and CANAN et al. (2011). The removal of \nphytic acid from rice bran through these techniques \naims to produce, as the main product, phytate, and \ngenerate as a by-product dephytinised defatted \nrice bran. Phytate is used in cosmetics and in the \npharmaceutical industry, to help prevent certain \nhuman diseases such as diabetes (LEE et al., 2006) \nand kidney stones (SAW et al., 2007), and in the \nfood industry to inhibit oxidative peroxidation \n(LEE &amp; HENDRICKS et al., 1995). Nevertheless, \ndephytinised rice bran can be used in the feed \nindustry, and may have higher nutrient availability \nbecause of its low content of phytate phosphorus. \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate nutritional and \nenergetic value of rice-by products, with or without \nphytase, using growing pigs.  \n\nMATERIAL   AND   METHODS\n\nThirty-six crossbred barrows were \nused (PIC sire and female DB-DanBred). The \nexperiment was conducted in metabolic cages and \ndivided into two periods of 10 consecutive days, \nwith 5 days of adaptation and 5 days of total feces \nand urine collection. Pigs weighed 29\u00b10.73kg and \n37\u00b10.55kg at the beginning of the first and second \nperiod, respectively. \n\nThe dephytinisation process consisted \nof maceration of the defatted rice bran (DRB), \nsolubilizing the bran in an aqueous solution followed \n\nby acidification of the solution. The methodology was \ndeveloped by the Federal University of Santa Maria \nand a private company (INGAL\u00ae). The same source \nof DRB used to feed the animals was used for the \ndephytinisation process.\n\nA randomized blocks design  was  used,  \nconsidering the sampling period as a block, with five \ntreatments and seven replicates. The experimental \nunit was the pig. The treatments were: (CONT) \nControl diet (ground corn and soybean meal); \n(CONT+Phy) Control diet with 100mg kg-1 phytase; \n(CONT+DRB) 700g kg-1 Control diet and 300g kg-1 \nDRB (defatted rice bran); (CONT+DRB+Phy) 700g \nkg-1 Control diet, 300g kg-1 DRB and 200mg kg-1 \nphytase; (CONT+DDRB) 700g kg-1 Control diet, \n300g kg-1 dephytinised defatted rice bran. The control \ndiet with phytase was introduced because phytase \ncould affect the reference diet, delivering nutrients \nthat could be attributed erroneously to DRB.\n\nThe enzyme used was Quantum Blue\u00ae, an \nenhanced 6-phytase from Escherichia coli and with \nan activity of 6,800 FTU g-1. The digestibility of the \nDRB, DRB+Phy and DDRD were calculated by the \ndifference (indirect) approach (ADEOLA, 2001).\n\nPigs received water ad libitum and the \namount of feed, distributed in two daily meals 9h \nand 17h, was adjusted to give an energy consumption \nof 2.6 times maintenance, estimated as 250kcal kg-1 \nEM\u00d7LW0.60 (NOBLET &amp; SHI, 1993). The Control \ndiet was formulated according to the nutritional \nrecommendations proposed by ROSTAGNO et al. \n(2011) (Table 1) for growing pigs. Rice bran was \nincluded in the diet by a difference (indirect) approach, \nwherein 300g kg-1 of the control diet on a dry matter \nbasis was replaced with the test ingredients.\n\nTotal feces and urine were collected, and \nthe beginning and end of each collection determined \nby the appearance of marked feces with the addition of \n0.25% of ferric oxide (Fe2O3) in the diets. Feces were \ncollected twice a day (10h and 18h), weighed, packed \nin plastic bags and stored in a freezer at -10\u00b0C. At the \nend of the experiment, the feces were homogenized \nand sampled (300g kg-1), dried in a forced air oven \nat 60\u00b0C for 72 hours, and ground for later analysis. \nUrine was collected in plastic buckets together with \n5ml H2SO4. The volume was weighed daily, and a \n10% aliquot was removed and refrigerated at -10\u00b0C. \n\nDiet, defatted and dephytinised rice bran \nand feces samples were ground in a knife mill with \na one millimeter sieve, and analyzed for dry matter, \ncrude protein, phosphorus and calcium. Gross \nenergy was analyzed by bomb calorimetry (model \nC2000 - IKA Werke GmbH and Co. KG, Staufen, \n\n\n\nNutritional and  energetic value of rice by?products, with or without phytase, for growing pigs.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.45, n.7, jul, 2015.\n\n1307\n\nGermany). Urine samples from each animal were \ndried in a forced air oven at 60\u00b0C for 72 hours, and \nalso analyzed for gross energy.\n\nDetermination of the coefficients of \ndigestibility (CD) of dry matter (CDDM), gross \nenergy (CDGE), crude protein (CDCP), calcium \nand phosphorus for the diets and ingredients \nwere calculated. The values of digestible protein \n(DP) in the defatted and dephytinised rice bran \nwere determined according to SAKOMURA &amp; \nROSTAGNO (2007). To calculate DE and ME of \nthe ingredients, CAMPBELL et al. (1983) formula \n\nwas used. From this calculation, the energy values \nof the two control diets, CONT and CONT+Phy \nwere compared.\n\nData were analyzed in a completely \nrandomized design, considering the period as a \nblock, by ANOVA and LS Means using the GLM \nprocedure (Statistical Analysis System, version 9.2). \nPooled SEM was calculated by averaging the SEM \ncalculated by the GLM procedure of SAS for the \nvariable of interest. A level of P<0.05 was defined as \nindicating statistical significance.  \n\nRESULTS   AND   DISCUSSION\n\nIn the comparison of the two control diets \n(with and without Phy), there was no difference in the \nenergy values obtained, independently of the use of \nphytase. Thus, all other calculations were developed \nusing the control diet without phytase.\n\nDry matter intake was similar for all \ntreatments, as expected since feed was provided in \naccordance with metabolic weight and the pigs had \nsimilar body weights (Table 2). The coefficients \nof digestibility of dry matter, gross energy, crude \nprotein, Ca, P, as well as DE and ME of the two \ncontrol diets were high compared to the other diets. \nThis result is consistent, since the control diets had \nadequate nutritional balance in their formulations and \nless fiber due to the absence of rice bran (Table 1). \nHowever, CONT+Phy showed a higher P digestibility. \nDietary starch and fiber are important nutrients for \npigs but are underappreciated in their complexity \n(REGMI et al., 2011). Increasing  rice bran  levels in \ngrowing and finishing pig diets  had  a linear effect  \non  nutrients digestibility (KUNRATH et al., 2010), \nrelated to the increase in fiber content, since \nincreasing  dietary fiber increases the rate of digesta \npassage (PARTANEN et al., 2007) and negatively \naffects the digestibility of many nutrients, even fiber \nitself (GOMES et al., 2007).\n\nThe addition of phytase to the diet \nwith rice bran not only improved the use of Ca \nand P, an effect that is already well known in the \nliterature (OMOGBENIGNUN et al., 2003), but \nalso improved digestibility of dry matter, energy \nand protein, similar to the findings of ZANELLA \net al. (1999). The diet with dephytinised DRB had \nlower dry matter digestibility than the diet with \nDRB+Phy, but similar gross energy and crude \nprotein digestibility. The DE and ME of the diet \nwith dephytinised DRB were higher compared to \nrice bran-containing diets. For the DDRB diet, Ca \nand P digestibility were lower than those for the \n\nTable 1 - Diet formulation and nutrient content of the control diet\n(CONT), defatted rice bran (DRB) and dephytinised\ndefatted rice bran (DDRB).\n\nIngredients (%) CONT\n\nCorn 70.10\nSoybean meal 44 CP 24.20\nSoybean oil 2.00\nLimestone 1.40\nDicalcium phosphate 1.20\nSalt 0.50\nL-Lysine HCl (78%) 0.16\nDL-Methionine 0.23\nEthoxiquin 0.03\nCholine Cl (60%) 0.07\nVitamin premix* 0.04\nMineral premix** 0.07\nCalculated and analyzed\ncomposition CONT DRB DDRB\n\nDry matter (%)1 88.10 87.70 87.70\nCrude protein (%)1 17.00 15.30 16.30\nDigestible lysine (%)1 0.89 - -\nDigestible methionine (%)1 0.28 - -\nMet+cys (%)1 0.53 - -\nTotal calcium (%)2 0.84 0.07 0.04\nTotal phosphorus (%)2 0.49 2.68 1.17\nPhytate (%)3 0.24 2.16 0.94\nSodium (%)1 0.20 - -\nAsh (%)2 0.50 - -\nEther extract (%)2 4.80 - -\nStarch (%)2 - 47.8 50.00\nGross energy (kcal kg-1)2 3,953 3,494 3,771\n\n*Vitamin premix provided the following per kilogram of diet:\nVitamin A, 11,200IU; Vitamin D3, 2,100IU; Vitamin E, 25.2mg;\nVitamin K, 2.8mg; Vitamin B1, 2.24mg; Vitamin B2, 7.14mg;\nVitamin B6, 2.17mg; Vitamin B12, 26\u00b5g; pantothenic acid,\n18.2mg; niacin, 36.4mg; folic acid, 0.63mg; Biotin, 126mcg.\n**Mineral premix provided the following per kilogram of diet:\nSe, 0.39mg; I, 0.46mg; Fe, 52mg; Cu, 10.4mg; Zn, 104mg; Mn,\n39mg.\n1Calculated data.\n2Analyzed data.\n3Date were calculated according to NRC (2012).\n\n\n\n1308  Dadalt et al.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.45, n.7, jul, 2015.\n\nDRB without Phy. The DRB diet generally had the \nlowest nutrient digestibilities. \n\nRegarding the digestibility of the test \ningredients (Table 3), control diet of dry matter, gross \nenergy and crude protein were higher for DRB+Phy \nand Dephytinised DRB than DRB. These values agree \nwith those obtained by NAMKUNG &amp; LEESON \n(1999), in which the use of phytase increased energy, \nminerals, and amino acid availability in the diet of \nbroilers. In the present study, the dephytinisation \nprocess had similar effect to the use of phytase \nenzyme in the animal.\n\nThe digestible protein (DP) of rice \nbran in this study was lower than that found by \n\nROSTAGNO et al. (2011) (79.3 vs 114.1g kg-1), \nalthough similar values for crude protein content \nwere noted (15.3 and 15.5%, respectively). A low \ncrude protein digestibility (56.6%) was also observed \nby KUNRATH et al. (2010), and is close to the value \nseen in this experiment (51.8%), and lower than \nthe values suggested by ROSTAGNO et al. (2011; \n74.6%). These variations may be associated with \nintrinsic and/or extrinsic ingredient characteristics, \nsuch as source and processing. In the two cases cited \nas having low digestibility, the rice bran was from \nthe south of Brazil. The type of rice processing can \nalso influence the chemical composition of the bran \n(DENARDIN et al., 2004).\n\nTable 2 - Dry matter intake, coefficients of digestibility of the control diet (CONT), CONT + phytase (CONT+Phy), CONT + defatted rice\nbran (CONT+DRB), CONT+DRB+Phy and CONT+dephytinised defatted rice bran (CONT+DDRB) in growing pigs.\n\n------------------------------------------Diets------------------------------------------\n\nCONT+ CONT+ CONT+\nCONT* CONT+ Phy\n\nDRB DRB+ Phy DDRB\n\n P SEM**\nDry matter intake (g day-1)\n\n1.55    1.55 1.58 1.54 1.54 0.5 0.001\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------Apparent digestibility------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDry matter (%) 87.3\u00aa 87.4\u00aa 77.5d 80.1b 78.8c&lt;0.001 0.004\nGross energy (%) 88.4\u00aa 88.1\u00aa 81.3c 82.6b 81.8bc&lt;0.001 0.003\nCrude protein (%) 85.2\u00aa 84.9\u00aa 74.4c 77.7b 78.3b&lt;0.001 0.007\nCalcium (%) 65.1\u00aa 68.2\u00aa 41.1c 55.7b 44.4c&lt;0.001 0.014\nPhosphorus (%) 47.1b 56.0\u00aa 15.1e 34.4c 28.9d&lt;0.001 0.019\nDE (kcal kg-1) 3,493\u00aa 3,470\u00aa 3,121d 3,183c 3,229b&lt;0.001 0.172\nME (kcal kg-1) 3,407\u00aa 3,386\u00aa 3,041d 3,095c 3,181b&lt;0.024 0.188\n\n Means sharing the same letters in rows did not differ for the LS-Means (P>0.05).\n*Data represents the average of seven replicates, except for CONT+DRB+Phy, which had eight replicates.\n**Standard error of mean.\n\nTable 3 - Coefficients of digestibility of the ingredients defatted rice bran (DRB), defatted rice bran + phytase (DRB+Phy) and dephytinised\ndefatted rice bran (DDRB) in growing pigs.\n\n-------------------------Ingrediets--------------------------\n\nDRB* DRB+ Phy DDRB\n     P SEM**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------Apparent digestibility------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDry matter (%) 54.7b 63.3a 60.6a&lt;0.003 0.016\nGross energy (%) 62.4 b 67.1\u00aa 69.0a&lt;0.020 0.020\nCrude protein (%) 51.8 b 60.4\u00aa 65.7\u00aa&lt;0.003 0.023\nCalcium (%) -0.5 b -0.2\u00aa -0.4 b&lt;0.001 0.000\nPhosphorus (%) -0.1c 0.5 a 0.05 b&lt;0.001 0.001\nDigestible Ca (g kg-1) 2.80 b 3.79 a 2.90 b&lt;0.001 0.000\nDigestible P (g kg-1) 1.62 b 3.41 a 2.11 b&lt;0.001 0.000\nDigestible protein (g kg-1) 79.25c 92.41 b 107.10 a&lt;0.001 0.004\nDigestible energy (kcal kg-1) 2,181c 2,343 b 2,545 a&lt;0.001 0.046\nMetabolizable energy (kcal kg-1) 2,140c 2,288 b 2,519 a&lt;0.001 0.049\n\nMeans followed by same letters in rows did not differ for the LS-Means (P>0.05).\n*Data represents the average of seven replicates, except for DRB+Phy, which had eight replicates.\n**Standard error of mean.\n\n\n\nNutritional and  energetic value of rice by?products, with or without phytase, for growing pigs.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.45, n.7, jul, 2015.\n\n1309\n\nThe Ca and P digestibility was greater for \nDRB+Phy than for DRB. The phytase enzyme has \nproven to be successful for degrading phytic acid \nin the gastrointestinal tract of pigs, with increases \nin the amounts of calcium and phosphorus \navailable, a response that confirms the results in \ntable 2 and is in agreement with TRUJILLO &amp; \nLINDEMANN (2010). The negative values seen \nin this experiment for Ca and P digestibility may \nbe associated with the high level of complexed \nP in rice bran and endogenous Ca and P. The \nantinutritive properties of phytate include forming \ncomplexes with amino acids, inhibiting porcine \nproteolytic enzymes, and increasing endogenous \namino acid secretions, thereby reducing apparent \namino acids digestibility and decreasing \navailability of P, Ca, and other divalent minerals \n(SELLE &amp;  RAVINDRAN, 2008).\n\nThe reduced coefficients of digestibility \nof Ca and P in Dephytinised rice bran compared to \nDRB+Phy may be associated with high amounts \nof phytic acid still remaining in the former after \nthe dephytinisation process. The rice bran and \nDephytinised rice bran  had 2.68 and 1.17% of \ntotal phosphorus, respectively (Table 1), showing \nthat 44% of the total phosphorus remained in the \ndephytinised bran. According to SERVI et al. (2008), \nreduction of phytic acid by more than 90% could \nsignificantly improve bioavailability and absorption \nof minerals and proteins. Since dephytinisation \ndid not remove all P, one can assume that some of \nremaining phosphorus was in the form of phytate, \nand supplementation with phytase could be positive. \nThe dephytinised rice bran showed the highest \nvalues of digestible protein, DE and ME (P<0.001), \ncompared to rice bran independently of the use of \nphytase. The higher crude protein and gross energy \nfound in Dephytinised, compared to rice bran \n(16.3% and 3,771kcal kg-1 vs. 15.3% and 3,494kcal \nkg-1, respectively, Table 1), and the slightly higher \namount of starch (50.0 vs 47.8%) explain the higher \nDE values of DDRB. According to HURRELL \n(2004), removing phytic acid facilitates ingredient \ndigestion because it prevents the chelation of myo-\ninositol hexaphosphate molecules with multivalent \nmetal ions, especially zinc and calcium. Phytate \nalso binds with proteins, amino acids, starch and \nenzymes such pepsin, trypsin and alpha amylase, \ncompromising digestion and absorption (CASEY \n&amp; WALSH, 2004). The low nutrient digestibility \nobserved with  DRB compared to DRB+Phy was \nalso observed by SILVA et al. (2005), when phytase \n\nsupplementation improved the apparent ileal \ndigestibility of amino acids from defatted rice bran \nand soybean meal in growing pigs.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe dephytinization process and phytase \naddition improved the nutrient digestibility of defatted \nrice bran.
