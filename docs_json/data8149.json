The three key aspects of ECOMANAGE are the \n\nconsideration that: (1) a coastal zone depends on local pressures, but also on pressures originated in the \n\ndrainage basin, transported mostly by rivers and by groundwater; (2) socio-economic activities are the \n\ndriving forces of those pressures and that their impacts on the ecosystem have feedback on socio-\n\neconomics; and, (3) the impacts depend on physical characteristics of the ecosystem that together with the \n\nloads determine its ecological state.  \n\nThree coastal zones showing conflicting interests between urban, industrial and agricultural \n\npressures and environmental maintenance have been selected for developing the system. The selected \n\nareas are: Ais\u00e9n Fjiord in Chile, Bah\u00eda Blanca estuary in Argentina and Santos estuary in Brazil.  \n\nThe purpose of this deliverable is to report on the groundwater flow and contaminant transport \n\nmodelling of the sedimentary aquifer at Alemoa area system for Santos Estuary basin. That allowed the \n\nevaluation of the contribution of the contaminant loads from the aquifer system at Alemoa\u2019s dump to the \n\nEstuary, on steady state conditions. \n\nThere was not enough quantitative data about contamination at Santos Estuary Basin. The illegal \n\nwaste dumped in Alemoa area was the first modelling approach chosen to represent quantification of \n\ndiffuse pollution loads, discharging to the Santos Estuary. \n\nThe model was developed using the following software: Ground Water Modelling System \u2013 GMS, \n\nwith the modules MAP, MODFLOW, PEST, MODPATH, and MT3D.  \n\n2 General Description \n\nThe dumpsite is placed at Alemoa quarter, one of the oldest of the city of Santos, in the coast of the \n\nState of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. This area is inside of the limits of the Santos Port, where today is located an \n\nimportant industrial complex, with patios and deposits of containers used to transport loads to and from the \n\nSantos Port. \n\nThe area of this study is about 917 174.2 m2, and in its neighbourhood predominates terminals of \n\nliquid granaries storage and small commerce. The Alemoa\u2019s dump is located inside the Estuary Basin area, \n\n\n\nDeliverable 2.7 \u2013 Santos Case Study Area  ECOMANAGE \n\n2 LNEC - 0607/17/15488  \n\nin the \"Unidade de Gerenciamento de Recursos H\u00eddricos\" (Water Resources Management Unit) nr 7, called \n\n\"Bacia Hidrogr\u00e1fica da Baixada Santista\" (\"Baixada Santista\" Hydrographic Basin). \n\nThe dumpsite includes part of the land area that contributes with fresh water (flows at the surface or \n\nunderground) to the Santos Estuary (Fig. 1). \n\n \nSource: modified from Mancuso and Lobo Ferreira (2007) \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Map localization of the study area \n\n \n\nThe Alemoa\u2019s dump was used for more than 50 years as a disposal for solid waste related to the \n\noperation of Santos Port and domestic waste illegally dumped in the area. Beyond these activities, the area \n\nwas used to store and move explosives on the access bridge made of armed concrete built in the extremity \n\nof the land, on the implantation of seedbed of workmanships for the magnifying of the wharf in the stretch \n\nValongo-Paquet\u00e1 and from the material dragged during the activities of implantation of Petrobras\u00b4 terminal.  \n\nAccording to exposition scenes, the area was considered by ASTM 1739/95 as a type 1 scenario \n\nassociated with immediate risks. This classification was determined once the area fits in the affirmation \u201cA \n\nsensible habitat (e.g. mangrove, Atlantic Forest, etc.), environmental protected areas or sensible receivers \n\n(species economically important, species in danger or threatened species) are impacted or affected\u201d \n\n(ESSENCIS, 2005). \n\n \n\nAlemoa\u2019s dump \n\n\n\nECOMANAGE Deliverable 2.7 \u2013 Santos Case Study Area \n \n\nLNEC - 0607/17/15488 3 \n\n3 Groundwater Conceptual Model \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nA groundwater flow model was developed for the sedimentary aquifer. The conceptualization was \n\nbased on the physical system, its geometry, geology and hydrogeology. The conceptual model also \n\ncomprises groundwater recharge estimation and water budget understanding. \n\nThe area for modelling was defined in AutoCAD, using lithologic and hydrogeologic information of 35 \n\nboreholes. As a boundary condition for the sedimentary aquifer, it was considered the crystalline interface \n\nat -25 m deep. To delimitate this area a topographic map (AGEM, 1:1 000) was used. The data was used to \n\nproduce a grid with 10 m x 10 m cells representing the elevation surface.  \n\n \n\n3.2 Geology and Hydrogeology \n\nThe geology of the area may be grouped into the basement formations (Palaeozoic and Pre- \n\nCambrian) and Cenozoic cover (marine and mixed sediments). \n\nThe basement formations are the result of several tectonic phases, responsible for deformation, \n\nfaulting, foliation, besides metamorphism and magmatic processes, combined with variations of climate and \n\nsea level. Inland, several faulting and epeirogenesis have produced the escarpment of the actual Serra do \n\nMar. In the Cenozoic, the main events may be summarised in topography modelling, tropical humid climate, \n\nsea transgression and deposition of the sedimentary sequences (MANCUSO and LOBO-FERREIRA, \n\n2007). \n\nData from hydraulic conductivity in the area was estimated as a function of the lithology (siltic clayey \n\ndeposits): Kx, Ky, Kz = 0.1 to 0.5 m/d. Groundwater levels have been monitored for mapping of the \n\npiezometry (ESSENCIS, 2005). Groundwater levels are almost at surface and vary from 0 to 4 m elevation \n\n(Table 1). \n\n \n\n3.3 Groundwater Recharge \n\nGroundwater recharge, for modelling purpose (R = 678 mm/year), was estimated as 28.2% from \n\nprecipitation (MANCUSO and LOBO-FERREIRA, 2007). \n\n \n\n\n\nDeliverable 2.7 \u2013 Santos Case Study Area  ECOMANAGE \n\n4 LNEC - 0607/17/15488  \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Monitored groundwater levels for the mapping of the piezometry \n\nWell X Y Topographic elevation (m) Hydraulic Head (m) \nS-11/PM 362 381.1790 7 353 714.1481 3.1785 1.5785 \nS-15/PM 362 205.2999 7 353 408.6719 1.5729 0.5 \nS-16/PM 362 194.5880 7 353 410.9418 1.5712 0.5 \nS-17/PM 362 361.8205 7 353 385.7727 1.7835 0.2835 \nS-18/PM 362 371.9807 7 353 383.6483 1.7689 0.3889 \nS-19/PM 362 659.9835 7 353 350.3634 1.6094 0.6794 \nS-20/PM 362 669.3322 7 353 349.2198 1.6821 0.7521 \nS-21/PM 361 612.8594 7 353 519.6963 1.5748 0.5 \nS-22/PM 361 627.2878 7 353 516.8373 1.5496 0.2596 \nS-24/PM 361 809.0861 7 353 549.9354 0.8947 0.5 \nS-25/PM 361 820.7692 7 353 549.0139 0.8391 0.5 \nS-26/PM 361 972.9756 7 353 410.2031 1.4878 0.7178 \nS-27/PM 361 982.6487 7 353 408.1024 1.4923 0.5 \nS-28/PM 362 530.4385 7 353 311.2870 0.9544 0.5 \nS-29/PM 362 540.3839 7 353 309.3671 0.9465 0.5 \nS-30/PM 362 219.2530 7 353 562.8653 3.2118 2.4118 \nS-31/PM 362 141.4904 7 353 499.4137 2.5203 1.1203 \nS-32/PM 362 046.3260 7 353 527.7851 1.8496 0.5296 \nS-33/PM 361 950.1086 7 353 602.3781 2.0011 0.8611 \nS-35/PM 362 236.5749 7 353 660.7956 3.0669 0.5 \nS-36/PM 362 098.3407 7 353 718.9518 1.3379 0.4979 \nS-37/PM 362 209.2419 7 353 753.7544 1.0398 0.4498 \nS-38/PM 362 288.1165 7 353 877.9594 1.3640 0.3640 \nS-39/PM 362 335.3982 7 353 940.6594 1.2161 0.4161 \nS-40/PM 362 259.0458 7 353 778.3469 1.2681 0.4681 \nS-41/PM 362 267.9424 7 353 776.0556 1.3550 0.6050 \nS-42/PM 362 334.3059 7 353 897.9153 1.2974 0.3774 \nS-43/PM 362 334.0463 7 353 906.4752 1.3275 0.4075 \nS-44/PM 362 327.6866 7 353 784.2366 1.0685 0.5 \nS-46/PM 362 313.4012 7 353 656.4726 3.6828 3.0228 \nS-47/PM 362 462.3715 7 353 663.6543 3.4739 2.6539 \nS-48/PM 362 286.7464 7 353 603.4566 4.6301 4.2301 \nS-49/PM 362 281.7879 7 353 538.4477 5.4615 1.4915 \nS-50/PM 362 290.7011 7 353 538.9316 6.0120 2.7820 \nS-55/PM 362 049.9415 7 353 647.6317 3.5050 1.4850 \n\n \n\n4 Groundwater Mathematical Model \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nThe total area modelled is 917 174.2 m2 and comprises part of S\u00e3o Vicente island. \n\nThe mathematical groundwater flow model used in this study was MODFLOW. MODFLOW was first \n\npublished by MCDONALD and HARBAUGH (1988). The flow model was developed considering flow as a \n\n\n\nECOMANAGE Deliverable 2.7 \u2013 Santos Case Study Area \n \n\nLNEC - 0607/17/15488 5 \n\nsteady state, with lakes and the channel considered as constant head cells. Rivers were simulated as \n\ndrains. \n\nConsidering the lithology, a two layers model was defined, with both layers on the porous aquifer. \n\nThe bottom elevation of the first layer is -3.5 m, and the second is -25 m, so the first layer has a thickness \n\nof 4 m until 10 m. \n\n \n\n4.2 Grid \n\nThe 3D model grid starts at the World Coordinates X = 361 606.269 m, Y = 7 352 826.235 m and Z = \n\n-25 m, ending at X = 362 878.551 m, Y = 7 354 058.188 m and Z = -25 m. The model has two layers \n\nsubdivided into 123 rows by 127 columns. Each cell is 10 m by 10 m long in the xx and yy directions (Table \n\n2). The thickness for layer 1 varies according to the topography. \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Grid characteristics for Alemoa area groundwater model \n\nDimension \nGrid \n\nx y z \nOrigin 361 609.27 m 7 352 826.24 m -25 m \nLength 1 272.28 m 1 231.95 m 32 m \n\nNumber of Cells 127 123 2 \n \n\nCell Size 10 m 10 m  \n \n\n \n\n4.3 Layer Attributes \n\nA layer was built to input recharge, hydraulic conductivity and a boundary in Modflow Model. The \n\nhydrogeological characterisation was accomplished using the geometry and hydraulic data from the \n\ngeological formations.  \n\n \n\n4.4 Source/Sinks Attributes \n\nSurface water from river, drains and Santos estuary was represented as drains, river and constant \n\nhead on Modflow model. The drains were represented on the first layer as a partially penetrating water \n\nsystem. The river was represented as an interception system for groundwater flow, and the Santos estuary \n\nhas been represented as a constant head and a fully interception system for groundwater flow.

In the Alemoa area, the groundwater flows towards the river and the drains opened according to the \n\ndevelopment needs from urban and Santos Estuary.  \n\nWater budget showed that flow in and out from the system are almost the same, with a discrepancy \n\nminor than 0.001%.

The model was \n\npublished by Zheng and Wang (1999) and it is used to calculate the transport of a contamination plume by \n\nsolving the transport equations.  \n\nFour setups of the transport models were developed to assess the contamination plumes of \n\nbenzene, cadmium, lead and toluene for a period of 100 years.

It was based only on existing data. It is \n\nimportant to collect new data to improve this first modelling approach. \n\nConsidering the existing data, the contaminant transport model allowed the simulation of advection \n\nand dispersion into the aquifer system. The final aim was the quantification of diffuse pollution loads, \n\ndischarging to the Santos Estuary. \n\nFrom the results it can be concluded that the contaminant discharge of the Alemoa\u2019s dump to Santos \n\nEstuary are mainly directed to the drains, i.e. the values of directly flowing groundwater diffuse pollution into \n\nSantos Estuary are smaller than those values flowing to drains. Contaminant discharge of dumpsite to the \n\nEstuary was calculated as 1 750.49 mg/yr to benzene, 533.10 mg/yr to toluene, 8 247.04 mg/yr to lead and \n\n646.03 mg/yr to cadmium.  \n\n \n\nThe authors do suggest this research work to be further improved. This requires additional detailed \n\nfield information, becoming available in terms of piezometry, inventory of wells, contaminant monitoring \n\ndata, risk assessment, geophysical data, and hydraulic characterisation and remediation techniques \n\nalternatives studies. \n\n\n\nECOMANAGE                          Deliverable 2.7 \u2013 Santos Case Study Area \n \n\nLNEC - 0607/17/15488 11 \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Contamination plume for Benzene \n\n \n\nTable 6 \u2013 Mass budget for Benzene \n\n In (mg) Out (mg) \n\nCONSTANT CONCENTRATION 224 973.40 - 25 790.25 \n\nCONSTANT HEAD 0.000000 - 44 605.91 \n\nDRAINS 0.000000 - 130 443.00 \n\nRIVERS 0.000000 - 0.1913011 e-13 \n\nRECHARGE 0.000000 0.000000 \n\nMASS STORAGE (SOLUTE) 52.06100 -24 207.45 \n\n[TOTAL] 225 025.40 -225 046.60 \n\nNET (IN - OUT): -21.14062 \nDISCREPANCY (PERCENT): -0.9394330E-02 \n\n\n\nDeliverable 2.7 \u2013 Santos Case Study Area                          ECOMANAGE \n\n12 LNEC - 0607/17/15488  \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Contamination plume for Toluene \n\n \n\nTable 7 \u2013 Mass budget for Toluene \n\n In (mg) Out (mg) \n\nCONSTANT CONCENTRATION 82 006.40 -22 891.92 \n\nCONSTANT HEAD 0.000000 - 2 214.610 \n\nDRAINS 0.000000 - 51 095.49 \n\nRIVERS 0.000000 - 0.6310048 e-6 \n\nRECHARGE 0.000000 0.000000 \n\nMASS STORAGE (SOLUTE) 13.82644 - 5 967.535 \n\n[TOTAL] 82 020.23 -82 169.55 \n\nNET (IN - OUT): -149.3203 \nDISCREPANCY (PERCENT): -0.1818874 \n\n\n\nECOMANAGE                                Deliverable 2.7 \u2013 Santos Case Study Area \n \n\nLNEC - 0607/17/15488 13 \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Contamination plume for Cadmium \n\n \nTable 8 \u2013 Mass budget for Cadmium \n\n In (mg) Out (mg) \n\nCONSTANT CONCENTRATION 76 920.11 - 8 057.009 \n\nCONSTANT HEAD 0.000000 - 5 355.097 \n\nDRAINS 0.000000 - 59 247.54 \n\nRIVERS 0.000000 - 0.5247957 e-6 \n\nRECHARGE 0.000000 0.000000 \n\nMASS STORAGE (SOLUTE) 5.804924 - 4 282.970 \n\n[TOTAL] 76 925.91 - 76 942.62 \n\nNET (IN - OUT): -16.70312 \nDISCREPANCY (PERCENT): -0.2171090E-01 \n\n\n\nDeliverable 2.7 \u2013 Santos Case Study Area                          ECOMANAGE \n\n14 LNEC - 0607/17/15488  \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Contamination plume for Lead \n\n \n\n Table 9 \u2013 Mass budget for Lead \n In (mg) Out (mg) \n\nCONSTANT CONCENTRATION 963 184.6 - 57 823.38 \n\nCONSTANT HEAD 0.000000 - 329 849.9 \n\nDRAINS 0.000000 - 494 854.8 \n\nRIVERS 0.000000 - 0.2386230 e-5 \n\nRECHARGE 0.000000 0.000000 \n\nMASS STORAGE (SOLUTE) 120.4294 - 81 705.09 \n\n[TOTAL] 963 305.1 - 964 233.2 \n\nNET (IN - OUT): -928.1250 \nDISCREPANCY (PERCENT): -0.9630159E-01 \n\n\n\nECOMANAGE Deliverable 2.7 \u2013 Santos Case Study Area \n \n\nLNEC - 0607/17/15488  15 \n\n \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnol\u00f3gicas do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil  \n\nand \n\nLisboa, Laborat\u00f3rio Nacional de Engenharia Civil, March 2008 \n\n \nVISAS AUTHORS \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nJ.P.
