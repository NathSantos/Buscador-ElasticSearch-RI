Concerning the miscibility effect, molecular diffusion is the process describing \n\nthe natural mixture of miscible fluids, whose main modeling parameter is the molecular diffusion \n\ncoefficient. The aim of this study is to measure the diffusion coefficient and swelling factor of \n\nCO2 in light crude oil under different experimental conditions concerning pressure, temperature \n\nand oil composition. In order to obtain the diffusion coefficient, two experimental techniques \n\nwere run in parallel: the well-established and so-called pressure decay method and a CT scan \n\nmethod that was still under investigation. The later method was also used to obtain the swelling \n\nfactor in the selected experimental conditions.  \n\n The oil studied was light oil from Brazilian subsalt oil reservoirs. Tests were carried on a \n\nspecially constructed vertical high pressure cell, from 2.76 MPa to 28.96 MPa (400 psi to 4200 \n\npsi) at 293.15 K (20oC) and just 10.34 MPa (1500 psi) at 341.15 K (65oC). \n\nMolecular diffusion is particularly important for miscible gas flooding processes, as \n\ndiffusion is a key mechanism controlling the miscibility between oil and gas. The diffusion \n\ncoefficient determines the rate of mass transfer during the diffusive process that will result in a \n\nmiscible system. The diffusivity of solvents into light oil in porous media has become of great \n\nsignificance in petroleum engineering, since CO2 injection has been proposed more and more as \n\nthe enhanced oil recovery method to be applied in the reserves of conventional oils. \n\nThe swelling effect of crude oil with CO2 increases the oil formation volume factor so \n\nthat residual oil after waterflooding is smaller in volume at surface conditions. The extent of the \n\nexpansion or swelling is measured by the swelling factor. \n\nWhile diffusion in CO2-heavy oils systems has attracted some attention, the subject in \n\nlight crude oils is scarcely described in the public literature. Such prospect needs therefore to be \n\nthoroughly investigated for the pre-salt reservoirs offshore Brazil, where oil has an API gravity \n\nbetween 28 and 30 and a variable contents of CO2. Due to such properties, differences in the \n\nmodels regarding boundary conditions at the interface and in the thermodynamics of the CO2-\n\nvolatile oil must be taken into consideration.   \n\nix \n \n\n\n\nDiffusion coefficients were obtained using only the pressure decay technique throughout \n\nEtminan et al. (2013) interface resistance model. The obtained diffusion coefficients were within \n\nthe ranges previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, another parameter obtained with the \n\nmodel, namely the mass transfer coefficient, allowed identifying that there was almost no mass \n\ntransfer resistance in the interface in original oil. \n\nDespite the CT limitations to obtain CO2 concentration, CT investigation could offer an \n\nimportant insight on CO2 diffusion inside the oil column. In contrast the swelling effect could be \n\nclearly observed and characterized through this method. \n  \n\nKey Word: Diffusion, swelling, CO2, light oil, pressure decay, CT-scan. \n\n  \n\nx \n \n\n\n\nRESUMO \n\nO CO2 utilizado na recupera\u00e7\u00e3o avan\u00e7ada em reservat\u00f3rios de petr\u00f3leo \u00e9 um importante \n\nagente de inje\u00e7\u00e3o devido a suas caracter\u00edsticas de miscibilidade e de inchamento. No que tange a \n\nmiscibilidade, a difus\u00e3o molecular \u00e9 o processo que descreve a mistura natural de fluidos \n\nmisc\u00edveis, e seu principal par\u00e2metro \u00e9 o coeficiente de difus\u00e3o molecular. O objetivo deste estudo \n\n\u00e9 medir o coeficiente de difus\u00e3o bem como o fator de inchamento do CO2 em \u00f3leos leves em \n\ndiferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais envolvendo press\u00e3o, temperatura e composi\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00f3leo. Com \n\nintuito de obter o coeficiente de difus\u00e3o, duas t\u00e9cnicas experimentais foram realizadas em \n\nparalelo: uma primeira t\u00e9cnica conhecida como decaimento de press\u00e3o e outra chamada de \n\ntomografia computadorizada. Esta \u00faltima, apesar de ainda estar em processo de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\npermitiu tamb\u00e9m a obten\u00e7\u00e3o do fator de inchamento nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais selecionadas. \n\nO \u00f3leo estudado \u00e9 um \u00f3leo leve proveniente dos reservat\u00f3rios do pr\u00e9-sal no Brasil. Os \n\ntestes foram efetuados em uma c\u00e9lula para altas press\u00f5es especialmente desenvolvida para esses \n\nensaios que envolvem tomografia computadorizada. As press\u00f5es e temperatura variaram de 2.76 \n\nMPa a 28.96 MPa a 293.15 K e somente 10.34 MPa a 341.15 K.  \n\nA difus\u00e3o molecular \u00e9 considerada um mecanismo chave que controla a miscibilidade \n\nentre o \u00f3leo e o g\u00e1s. Sabendo que o coeficiente de difus\u00e3o determina a taxa de transfer\u00eancia de \n\nmassa durante o processo, a difus\u00e3o de solventes em \u00f3leo leve dentro de um meio poroso se \n\ntornou de grande import\u00e2ncia na engenharia de petr\u00f3leo.  \n\nEm paralelo, o inchamento do \u00f3leo bruto com CO2 aumenta o fator de volume de \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00f3leo a tal ponto que o \u00f3leo residual remanescente ap\u00f3s a inje\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua \u00e9 menor \n\nem volume nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de superf\u00edcie. A extens\u00e3o do aumento ou do inchamento \u00e9 medida pelo \n\nfator de inchamento. \n\nNos \u00faltimos anos a difus\u00e3o do CO2 em \u00f3leo pesado tem atra\u00eddo uma maior aten\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nenquanto que a difus\u00e3o em \u00f3leo leve tem sido pouco estudada na literatura. Com foco nos \n\nreservat\u00f3rios do pr\u00e9-sal no litoral brasileiro, onde o \u00f3leo tem entre 28 a 30 graus API e \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es variadas de CO2, diferentes modelos de difus\u00e3o envolvendo as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nfronteira na interface e a termodin\u00e2mica do CO2-\u00f3leo vol\u00e1til precisam ser levados em \n\nconsidera\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nxi \n \n\n\n\nNo presente trabalho, os coeficientes de difus\u00e3o puderam ser obtidos somente atrav\u00e9s da \n\nt\u00e9cnica experimental de decaimento de press\u00e3o por meio do modelo de resist\u00eancia na interface \n\nproposto por Etminan et al. (2013). Os coeficientes de difus\u00e3o estavam dentro dos intervalos \n\nreportados previamente na literatura. Al\u00e9m disso, um outro par\u00e2metro, o coeficiente de \n\ntransfer\u00eancia de massa, permitiu identificar que a resist\u00eancia \u00e0 transfer\u00eancia de massa na interface \n\nera praticamente insignificante no \u00f3leo original. \n\nApesar das limita\u00e7\u00f5es do m\u00e9todo de tomografia computadorizada na obten\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2 no \u00f3leo, a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o desse m\u00e9todo ofereceu uma melhor compreens\u00e3o \n\ndo fen\u00f4meno da difus\u00e3o do CO2 dentro da coluna de \u00f3leo.

INTRODUCTION \n\nOil recovery changes along reservoir producing life. First, it relies on reservoir natural \n\nenergy (primary recovery) until it is depleted. So additional energy is required throughout \n\nphysical displacement (secondary recovery) during its viable economic lifetime. A different kind \n\nof additional energy (tertiary recovery) enhances fluid flow conditions due to increasing oil \n\nmobility by changing oil properties through either the addition of heat, the chemical interaction \n\nbetween the injected fluid and the reservoir oil or the mass transfer. \n\nAll information above is described in Figure 1.1, where it is pointed out the difference \n\nbetween IOR (Increased Oil Recovery) and EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery). The first one still has \n\na wide range of techniques covering, besides water flooding or gas pressure maintenance. The \n\nlast one comprises only the thermal, the chemical and the gas miscible/immiscible (Stosur et al., \n\n2003).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 - Proposed definitions of the EOR and IOR terms (Stosur et al., 2003) \n\n1 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nSince in 1950, CO2-EOR appeared as an important injection agent in oil reservoir due to \n\nits high level of solubility in oil and low level in water. This main characteristic leads to the \n\nfollowing factors that make CO2 an effective EOR agent (Carcoana, 1992): \n\n\u2022 miscibility effects, given the fact that since CO2 is not first-contact miscible with \n\nreservoir oils, it may develop miscibility through multiple contacts under specific \n\nconditions of pressure and temperature and with specific oil compositions; \n\n\u2022 swelling of crude oil and reduction in oil density; \n\n\u2022 reduction in the water-oil mobility ratio as oil viscosity is reduced expressively \n\nwhen CO2 is dissolved in crude oil followed by a small increase in water \n\nviscosity; \n\n\u2022 acid effect on carbonate and shaley rocks. \n\nWithin the context of pre-salt reservoirs offshore Brazil, a sustainable hydrocarbon \n\nproduction will require the re-injection of the produced CO2-rich stream into the reservoir. \n\nDuring a gas injection operation, the amount of gas to be injected and the time reserved to reach \n\nthe desired mobility of reservoir fluids are constraints that need to be determined for field design \n\nand reservoir simulation. The definition of such constraints requires the provision of data \n\nconcerning the solubility and diffusivity of the gas in oil under reservoir conditions \n\n(Tharanivasan et al., 2006). The definition of the molecular diffusion coefficient in a \n\nmulticomponent system is for instance very difficult to be determined without experimental \n\nmeasurements. Thus, several methods have been developed to determine the solvent-oil diffusion \n\ncoefficient. On the other hand, oil swelling increases the recovery factor since, for a given \n\nresidual oil saturation, the mass of the oil remaining in the reservoir is lower than if the \n\nabandoned oil were CO2 free, as described by Carcoana (1992). \n\nWhile diffusion in CO2-heavy oils systems has attracted some attention, the subject in \n\nlight crude oils is scarcely described in the public literature (Guo et al., 2009). Such prospect \n\nneeds therefore to be thoroughly investigated for the above referred pre-salt reservoirs offshore \n\nBrazil, where oil has an API gravity between 28 and 30, a gas-oil ratio between 200 and 350 \n\nm3/m3 and a variable contents of CO2 (8 to 15 per cent) (Estrella, 2011). Due to such properties, \n\ndifferences in the models regarding boundary conditions at the interface and in the \n\nthermodynamics of the CO2-volatile oil must be taken into consideration.   \n\n2 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n1.1. Objectives \nThe aim of this study is to measure the diffusion coefficient and swelling factor of CO2 in \n\nlight crude oil under different experimental conditions concerning pressure, temperature and oil \n\ncomposition. In order to obtain the diffusion coefficient, two experimental techniques were run in \n\nparallel: the well-established and so-called pressure decay method and a CT scan method that \n\nwas still under investigation. The later method was also used to obtain the swelling factor in the \n\nselected experimental conditions.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n3 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n4 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nWithin the context of miscibility of CO2 in oil, molecular diffusion figures as the main \n\nphenomenon of interest now. In this chapter, the molecular diffusion and its main parameter the \n\ndiffusion coefficient will be described. One first possible way of obtaining such key parameter is \n\nthrough empirical or theoretical correlations. This offers nevertheless several problems \n\nconcerning the target system characteristics. Consequently, focus will be given to two \n\nexperimental methods, namely pressure decay and CT scan, alongside their respective models. \n\nFinally a similar analysis will also be performed with swelling.      \n\n2.1. Molecular Diffusion \nHere it is firstly important to differentiate miscibility from solubility. The first one is valid \n\nwhen two or more fluids form a single homogeneous phase in all mixed proportions while for the \n\nlast one this happens only for a single level of proportions (Aljarwan, 2012). In addition to this, \n\ntwo miscible fluids will in the case of EOR present no interface and no capillary effect when in \n\ncontact with porous media.  \n\nIn 1976, Holm compared CO2 to other recovery agents in miscible displacement like light \n\nhydrocarbons enriched gases and other solvents. CO2 was for instance the only one to reach \n\nmiscible displacement at the lowest pressures (6.89 MPa to 20.68 MPa or 1000 psi to 3000 psi), \n\nand it was also suitable to reservoirs that have been exhausted of their gas and LPG components. \n\nFurthermore, CO2 presents additional advantages in terms of availability, cost, and operational \n\nhandling (Holm, 1976). \n\n Such properties make CO2 the preferred gas in water-alternating-gas (WAG) processes. \n\nIn such processes, water and CO2 are alternatively injected until a well-defined volume of last \n\none is attained, being afterwards followed by a continuous water injection. Compared with \n\nwaterflooding without CO2, WAG processes improve mobility ratio and additional recovery. \n\nIn order to determine operating constraints for WAG processes, it is necessary to observe \n\nconditions that affect the multiple contacts in the miscibility developed by CO2. \n\nThere are several factors that affect CO2 miscible displacement. In regard to mixing \n\nmechanisms, there are three that contribute to this displacement process: microscopic convective \n\n5 \n \n\n\n\n \n\ndispersion, macroscopic convective dispersion, and molecular diffusion. The last one has an \n\nimportant role on the recovery of residual oil at pore scale. At low solvent flow rates and long \n\nresidence time, diffusion between CO2 and oil interacts effectively to remaining unrecoverable \n\noil, which is subsequently recovered by swelling (Aljarwan, 2012). Furthermore, the diffusion \n\npromotes mixing between the injected solvent and the oil, prevents viscous fingering, retards gas \n\nbreakthrough and therefore improves the sweep efficiency for enhancing oil recovery (Guo et al., \n\n2009).  \n\nComplementary to what has been previously mentioned, in the case of gas-based heavy \n\noil recovery, it has been recognized that the molecular diffusion has a significant role during the \n\nsoaking time while the convective-dispersion is predominant during the time of solvent injection \n\n(Tharanivasan et al., 2006). \n\nThus, in the succeeding subsections, molecular diffusion and swelling will be detailed in \n\nterms of fluid and fluid contact without considering fluid displacement in porous media. In such \n\nway dispersion will be ignored. \n\n2.2. Correlations for Molecular Diffusion \nIt is well established that the diffusion coefficient measured in a two-component system \n\ndepends on the presence or absence of a chemical concentration gradient (Prager, 1953).  \n\nThe common theoretical methods that predicts diffusion coefficient are limited, many of \n\nthem do not interpret adequately the kinetic phenomena because of several assumptions adopted. \n\nThe Chapman-Enskog theory describes diffusion in low-pressure binary-gas mixtures, but it not \n\napplicable for liquids, while the Stokes-Einstein theory is appropriate only to ideal liquid \n\nmixtures. Thus, none of them can be used to real liquid mixtures. (Leahy-Dios and Firoozabadi, \n\n2007). \n\nDue to this problem, several semi-empirical equations have been proposed in the literature \n\nto estimate these coefficients. The Wilke-Chang correlation is suitable only for diluted systems \n\nand at lower viscosities, conditions that are far from oil reservoirs. The Vignes equation is \n\nconsidered a very useful way to calculate the diffusion coefficient as function of the \n\nconcentration for systems involving hydrocarbons solvent and heavy oil, but it is limited to oil \n\nviscosity (Guerrero-Aconcha, 2009). \n\n6 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nConcerned about a correlation for non-ideal gas and liquid multicomponent mixtures, \n\nLeahy-Dios and Firoozabadi (2007) proposed a unified model to determine D for non-ideal and \n\nnon-polar multicomponent mixtures. They developed a new correlation based on 889 \n\nexperimental data for non-polar mixtures and found a general functional form where infinite \n\ndilution-diffusion coefficient was dependent on viscosity, reduced temperature, reduced pressure \n\nand acentric factor of each component. With the dilution-diffusion coefficient found, the \n\ngeneralized Vignes relation to multicomponent mixtures is used to obtain the Stefan-Maxwell \n\ndiffusion coefficient. This later coefficient is used to calculate the element of a square matrix \n\nwhich now is used to determine Fickian diffusion (mole based) in a non-ideal multicomponent \n\nmixture based on the relationship between Stefan-Maxwell and Fickian diffusive fluxes. In \n\nStefan-Maxwell diffusive flux, the matrix of thermodynamic factor is calculated from PR-EoS, \n\nwhich has high precision for non-ideal hydrocarbon mixtures.  \n\n2.3. Experimental Methods  \nAs aforementioned, the molecular diffusion coefficient in a multicomponent system is \n\nvery difficult to be determined without experimental measurements. Thus, several methods have \n\nbeen developed to determine the solvent-liquid diffusion coefficient. They are split in two \n\nconventional techniques: direct and indirect methods. In direct methods, the gas concentration is \n\nanalyzed with an analytical device. This procedure disturbs the system every time the sample is \n\ntaken, reducing the accuracy of the measurements. On the other hand, the indirect methods \n\nimplicate in observing some property of the gas\u2013liquid system which evolves with the gas \n\ndissolution.  \n\nIn order to develop proper gas-injection strategies, accurate values of relevant parameters \n\nsuch as gas-diffusion coefficient, interface mass-transfer coefficient and the liquid swelling \n\ncoefficient are required for reservoir simulation and prediction of oil recovery by miscible \n\nflooding and the optimization of miscibility for best recovery (Civan and Rasmussen, 2006). To \n\nproperly acquire those parameters experimentally, the indirect methods can be represented by: \n\npressure decay (PD) method, the constant pressure dissolving gas volumes (CPDGV) method, the \n\nlow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra change method, the X-ray computer-\n\nassisted tomography (CAT) method, the gas permeation through an immobilized liquid \n\n7 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nmembrane (ILM) method implemented in a diffusion cell, and the dynamic pendant drop volume \n\nanalysis (DPDVA) method.  \n\nWith proper description of the dissolution and evaporation process, diffusion coefficient \n\ncan be inferred from changes in bulk properties. Those properties can be volume, pressure, solute \n\nvolatilization rate, position of the gas-liquid interface, refraction of electromagnetic radiation, etc. \n\nThe medium property changed by the diffusing species is correlated with the composition. After \n\nthe composition of the bulk is established, a mass transfer model as those that will be described \n\nlater is required to determine diffusivity. Some indirect methods, like NMR and CAT, can \n\nestimate diffusivity by measuring the self-diffusion coefficients. Those methods on self-diffusion \n\ncoefficients are limited by the empirical mixing rules used to calculate the concentration-\n\ndependent diffusivity. In general, indirect methods are based on several simplifications, described \n\nin the upcoming section. \n\nNext, the experimental methods that were chosen for the present work will be described.  \n\n2.3.1. Pressure decay \n\nThe pressure decay method is a non-intrusive experimental method, where no \n\ncompositional measurements are necessary. It starts when a non-equilibrium gas is displaced into \n\na constant-volume constant-temperature PVT cell to remain in contact with a liquid. The gas \n\ninitial pressure starts decaying as the molecular diffusion of the gas into the liquid proceeds until \n\nthe system reaches the equilibrium. In other words, it means that the oil interface is entirely \n\nsaturated with the gas. In a constant temperature, the measured pressure versus time and the \n\nproposed model are used to extract a correct value of diffusion coefficient that best represents this \n\ndiffusion process (Riazi, 1996).  \n\n2.3.2. CT scan \n\n2.3.2.1. Principles \nThis technique, well-known as x-ray tomography, has been widely used in research \n\nlaboratories for reservoir rock characterization and fluid flow visualization. The fundamentals \n\nbehind CT scan are that the object internal structure can be reconstructed from its multiple \n\nprojections. In details, when an X-ray beam traverses an object, its intensity is attenuated as the \n\n8 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nX-ray photons are absorbed (photoelectric absorption) or scattered (Compton scattering and \n\nRayleigh scattering). While the photoelectric absorption is a process dependent on the component \n\natomic number and the energy of the X-ray beam, the Compton scattering is influenced by the \n\ncomponent bulk density. \n\nThe attenuation coefficient represents quantitatively how easily a material or medium can \n\nbe penetrated by a beam of X-ray. It can be expressed as a function of the X-ray beam photon \n\nenergy, the atomic number, and the electron density of the substance. Usually, Raleigh scattering \n\nis neglected, and then the attenuation coefficient can be expressed as the sum of Compton and \n\nphotoelectric contributions (Eq. 2.1). When a high-energy X-ray source is used, the contribution \n\nfrom photoelectric absorption can be negligible and the attenuation coefficient  ?  becomes \n\nproportional to the bulk density of the object, as the Compton scattering dominates. \n\n? =  ? ?? ???(?) +  \n?Z?3.8\n\n?3.2\n? 2.1 \n\nwhere ?  is the mass density, ??  is the mass electron density, ??(?)  is the Klein-Nishima \n\nfunction, Ze is the effective atomic number, E is the photon energy in KeV and b is a constant \n\n(Niu, 2010). \n\nThe amount that describes how effortlessly an X-ray beam can penetrate in a medium is \n\nnamed linear attenuation coefficient and is a result of the influence of the three different photon \n\ninteractions cited above.  \n\nLambert-Beer\u2019s law is set to measure the intensity of X-ray after it crossed the \n\ncomponent: \n\nI = I0exp (?\u00b5?) 2.2 \n\nwhere ? is the thickness of the penetration material, Io and I are the intensity of the incident x-ray \n\nand the transmitted one respectively. This law shows that photons with lower energy are absorbed \n\nfirstly while the remaining ones are those with higher energy, thus the beam becomes harder. \n\nThis brings on the total attenuation to change with distance and produce an artifact identified as \n\nbeam hardening. This artifact and other image quality issues will be discussed in Image quality \n\nsubsection. \n\n9 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n2.3.2.2. Quantitative information \nThe quantitative information from CT scanning is given by the measured attenuation \n\ncoefficients changed using the value for pure water as reference, being represented as CT \n\nnumbers (CTn) in Hounsfield units (H.U), \n\nCTn = 1000 \n\u00b5 ? \u00b5water\n\u00b5water\n\n 2.3 \n\nwhere, \u00b5 and \u00b5 water are the linear attenuation coefficient for the tested material and pure water. \n\nThe possibility of obtaining density from the CT number can be employed because x-ray \n\nattenuation coefficients are both dependent on bulk density and atomic number (see Eq. 2.1).  \n\nFor those materials where X-ray attenuation takes place, primarily only due to Compton \n\nscattering, there is a linear relationship (Eq. 2.4) between CT number and density (that varies \n\naccordingly to CT scanner type used.  \n\n? =  ?. CTn + ? 2.4 \n\nwhere ? and ? are constants accordantly to the measured energy level and CT-scan employed. \n\nFor other materials with atomic numbers that contributes to both Compton scattering and \n\nphotoelectric attenuation of X-rays, a dual energy measurement should be taken in order to have \n\na correct relationship between CT numbers and densities.  The method for determining density of \n\nthose materials is described in details in the United States Patent Number 5063509 (Coles et al., \n\n1991). \n\n? = (?CT? + ? CT?\n1\n\n+ ?)/? 2.5 \n\nwhere ?, ? and ? are constants accordantly to the measured energy level and CT-scan employed. \n\nTo obtain both Eq. 2.4 and Eq. 2.5, a series of calibration tests for liquid and solid \n\nsamples of known densities need to be accomplished. For the first equation, where only materials \n\nwith Compton scattering takes place, only a single energy X-ray source is used while for the \n\nsecond equation dual energy source calibration tests are needed (Coles et al., 1991). \n\nWith one of those density and CT relationships above, the next step is to obtain solvent \n\nconcentration in accordance to mixture density obtained.  \n\nFor liquid solvents in oil, the mixtures rules equation can be used to predict the density of \n\nthe solvent-oil mixture when there is no volume change after both components are mixed: \n10 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n?mix =  (1 ? Csolvent) ?oil +  Csolvent ?solvent 2.6 \n\nEq. 2.6 can be rearranged in Eq. 2.7:  \n\nCsol =  \n?mix ? ?oil\n?sol ? ?oil\n\n 2.7 \n\nReplacing the densities values in this last equation by Eq. 2.4, Eq. 2.8 is established as the \n\nmost important relationship employed to find solvent concentration in oil columns after CT \n\nnumbers are measured. In the case CT number and density that varies according to Eq. 2.4, the \n\nfollowing equation can be used: \n\nCsol =  \nCTmix ? CToil\nCTsol ? CToil\n\n 2.8 \n\nOnce, the rule of mixtures cannot be employed for gas solvents in oil, a correlation should \n\nbe used to obtain solvent concentration in relation to solvent-oil mixture density. Guerrero-\n\nAconcha et al. (2008) had already referred to this issue in their work as it will be detailed in the \n\nnext section. The work from Emera and Sarma (2008) presented a correlation to predict CO2-oil \n\ndensity for dead and live oils over a wider range and conditions. A Genetic Agorithm based \n\ncorrelation accounts for saturation pressure, temperature, oil specific gravity and initial density at \n\nthe specified temperature.  \n\n2.3.2.3. Dopants \nWhen CT numbers of fluids do not differ as much as possible to reduce error, dopants are \n\nusually employed to increase CT number in one of the fluids. The majority of dopants applied in \n\nliquid phase have halide, which has a high atomic number, producing more attenuation of X-ray \n\nand thus requiring dual energy measurement in order to have a good relationship between CTs \n\nand density (Eq. 2.5).  \n\nSo for small difference in attenuation coefficients (CT numbers) between different fluids, \n\nsodium bromide or sodium iodide are generally used as water dopants, while bromo-dodecane \n\nand iodo-dodecane are employed as oil dopants. \n\n11 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nOnce the choice of dopants is made, its addition should be done carefully, since they \n\naffect the thermodynamic properties of oil phase (viscosity, bubble point and minimum \n\nmiscibility pressure). \n\n2.3.2.4. Image quality (Niu, 2010). \nThe term \u2018Artefact\u2019 stands for the difference between the CT number in CT image and the \n\ntrue attenuation coefficient of the objects, which affects the image quality. In CT scan application \n\nin core analysis, there are two perceptible and downgrading physical based artifacts: the most \n\nnoticeable one is called beam hardening and the other one is the photon starvation. \n\nAs mentioned previously in this section, beam hardening happens because the low-energy \n\nphotons are more quickly attenuated than the high-energy photons, which causes the beam to \n\nbecome harder and more penetrating. The quantity of beam hardening rests on the initial X-ray \n\nspectrum and the composition of the material crossed. Images affected by the beam hardening are \n\ntypically characterized with high attenuation coefficients around the periphery of the object and \n\nlow attenuation coefficients in the center of the object. In practice, a filter can be used to reduce \n\nthe influence of beam hardening on the image. \n\nPhoton starvation on the other hand causes streak artefacts as an insufficient amount of \n\nphotons passes through the widest part of the materials. This artefacts normally happens when the \n\ncore or core holder are scanned vertically. In the present work, the diffusion cell is also placed \n\nvertically. That is why some considerations have to be made in order to design the cell that will \n\nbe scanned during the diffusion test. Aluminum and carbon fiber are the materials that can be \n\nused in CT scan. Aluminum is used for low pressure conditions while a carbon fiber wrapped \n\naluminum cell is suitable for high pressure conditions. This last combination is done because with \n\nthe increasing thickness of aluminum cell more photons are absorbed by the cell before enter in \n\nthe fluid inside it. \n\nAnother consideration to avoid artefact is that all objects should have round geometry to \n\nreduce photon starvation inside the scanner that is circular. Furthermore, the table should be \n\nmade of wood and the diameter of the surrounding lines should be as small as possible, to reduce \n\nthe loss of photons. \n\n12 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nIncreasing some machine parameters such as the potential difference across the tube (kV) \n\nand the output of the tube (mA\u00b7s) enabling higher electron speed and also higher energy of the X-\n\nray photons, resulting in improved image quality with less noise in the center of the object. \n\nIncreasing the two machine parameters above could therefore prevent several image \n\nquality issues \u2013 this was nevertheless not possible given the limitations of the here employed \n\nmedical CT scanner with fixed energy level and care dose limitations. \n\n2.4. Diffusion Models  \nThe classical Fick\u2019s law is the most popular diffusion model in reservoir engineering, and \n\nit is mainly employed for binary mixtures. Otherwise it can also be used for ideal \n\nmulticomponent mixture (pseudo-binary) considering that each component diffuses as a result of \n\nits own concentration gradient and diffusion coefficients which can be regarded as equal.  \n\nBird et al. (2007) started his diffusivity study with binary diffusion using the one-\n\ndimensional form of Fick\u2019s law of diffusion which defines how the molecular mass flux of \n\nspecies A in vertical direction z (jAz) in a binary mixture at a steady-state is transported by means \n\nof molecular motions per unit of area. The proportionality factor ?AB below is the diffusivity. \n\njAz =  ???AB\ndwA\ndz\n\n 2.9 \n\nwhere ? is the density of the system A and B and wA is the mass fraction of A. \n\nThe vector form of the equation above: \n\njA =  ???AB?wA 2.10 \n\nAs stated before, in addition to transport by molecular motion (jA), mass may also be \n\ntransported by the bulk motion (?Av) of the fluid. Later the molecular mass flux vector and the \n\nconvective mass flux vector are added together to get the combined mass flux vector (nA): \n\nnA = jA + ?Av 2.11 \n\nwhere v is the mass average velocity. \n\nFor the fixed volume element considered in this equation, the balance of mass needs to be \n\nanalyzed assuming the following contributions: rate of increase of mass of species a per unit \n\nvolume, net rate of addition of mass A per unit volume by convection, net rate of addition of \n13 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nmass of A per unit volume by diffusion, rate of production of mass of A per unit volume by \n\nreaction.  \n\nAll mass flux mentioned before are the combined ones that includes both the molecular \n\nflux and the convective flux and results in the equation of continuity for species A that can be put \n\nin the equivalent form: \n\n??\n?wA\n?t\n\n+ (v ? ?wA)? = ? (? ? jA) +  rA 2.12 \n\nwhere rA represents the rate of production of mass of A per unit volume by reaction. \n\nConsidering a binary system with constant ??AB, Fick\u2019s law of diffusion can be used: \n\n??\n?wA\n?t\n\n+ (v ? ?wA)? = ??AB?2wA +  rA 2.13 \n\nIf there is no chemical reaction occurring and in addition v is zero and ? is constant, the \n\ndiffusion equation is defined as: \n\n?cA\n?t\n\n= ?AB?2cA 2.14 \n\nThis equation represents unsteady-state mass-transfer process where concentration (cA) at \n\na given point varies with time. It is normally used for diffusion in solids or stationary liquids and \n\nfor equimolar counter-diffusion in gases, which means that the net molar flux with respect to \n\nstationary coordinates is zero.  \n\nOther additional diffusion models found in the literature alongside the classical Fick`s \n\nLaw are the Maxwell-Stefan, the generalized Fick\u2019s law and the irreversible thermodynamics \n\nformulation. The three first models are used only for molecular diffusion in single phases, i.e., \n\nintra-phase diffusion where diffusion is considered separately only in the gas phase and then only \n\nin the oil phase. But when diffusion occurs between components in the gas and oil phases, it is \n\ndefined as interface mass transfer and the diffusion model that can be used to describe such mass \n\ntransfer is the irreversible thermodynamic model.  \n\n14 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n2.5. Diffusion Modeling Assumptions \nSince the first mathematical model for pressure-decay experiment was formulated in 1996 \n\nby Riazi, the available models are limited by inherent simplifying assumptions. Therefore, before \n\nlisting the models, it is worthwhile to briefly describe those considerations.  \n\n(a) Pseudo-binary mixtures \n\nThere is an important difference between binary diffusion and multicomponent diffusion \n\nIn. binary diffusion the movement of species A is always proportional to the negative of the \n\nconcentration gradient of species A. In multicomponent diffusion, however, other interesting \n\nsituations can arise: (i) reverse diffusion, in which a species moves against its own concentration \n\ngradient; (ii) osmotic diffusion, in which a species diffuses even though its concentration gradient \n\nis zero; (iii) diffusion barrier, when a species does not diffuse even though its concentration \n\ngradient is nonzero. In addition, the flux of a species is not necessarily collinear with the \n\nconcentration gradient of that species. (Bird et al., 2007) \n\n(b) Natural Convection \n\nMass transfer between two fluid phases happens by evaporation and condensation through \n\ntheir interface. As these processes are usually faster than the diffusive and convective time scales \n\nin either phase, the rate of mass transfer is controlled by how efficiently mass is transported from \n\nthe interface and into the bulk. When the density of the heavier (lighter) phase does not increase \n\n(decrease) during the mixing process, there will be no natural convection and the rate of mixing is \n\ngoverned by diffusion. No bulk flow is a common assumption in the modeling of PVT cell \n\nexperiments (Haugen and Firoozabadi, 2009). Natural convection in mixtures in which liquid \n\ndensity increases with dissolution and gas density decreases with evaporation  may affect the gas-\n\ndiffusion rate (Civan and Rasmussen, 2006). \n\n(c) Swelling Effect \n\nWhen swelling happens in the oil phase, the original capillary equilibrium breaks down, \n\nresulting in a pore-scale redistribution of the phases and then in oil mobilization. Thus an \n\nimportant factor is the time required by CO2 to swell oil significantly (Grogan and Pinczewki, \n\n1987). When swelling is contemplated, it is necessary to consider interface movements. Hence, a \n\n15 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nconvective term in the diffusion gas continuity equation needs to be incorporated. Swelling will \n\nnot be taken in consideration during the present diffusion model but it will be described in details \n\nin the next section. \n\n(d) Unidirectional diffusion \n\nThe non-volatility of oil is verified by a compositional analysis of the solvent phase after \n\nthe diffusion test. This oil characteristic renders a one-way diffusion of the solvent in oil, \n\nassumed as unidirectional diffusion. \n\n(e) Real gas deviation factor \n\nIn order to obtain the mass of diffused gas, a constant gas compressibility factor is usually \n\nemployed in the literature. It is important to mention that the real-gas deviation factor might \n\ndeviate significantly from the unity at elevated pressures. \n\n(f) Henry\u2019s law \n\nApplication of Henry\u2019s law is questioned by Civan and Rasmussen (2006), when they say \n\nthat the application of a non-equilibrium boundary condition alleviates the problems concerned \n\nby neglecting the oil volume caused by swelling and the pressure dependency of the real gas \n\ndeviation factor. Once, the majority of methods contemplate dilute solutions to neglect both \n\nswelling effect and diffusion coefficient gas concentration dependency, higher concentrations of \n\nthe dissolved gas in the liquid phase may affect the quality of estimated parameters (Rasmussen \n\nand Civan, 2008). \n\n(g) Diffusivity concentration dependency \n\nThere are many real systems for which the diffusivity depends upon concentration. Such \n\nconcentration-dependence exists in most systems, but often, for example in dilute solutions, the \n\ndependence is slight and the diffusion coefficient can be assumed constant for practical purposes. \n\nA number of methods have been used to obtain numerical solutions, some applicable to any type \n\nof concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, and others restricted to particular types, such as \n\nexponential or linear dependence. (Crank, 1975) \n\n16 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nAs stated by Guerrero-Aconcha (2009), for the diffusion coefficient to be considered \n\nconstant there are three key factors that have to be achieved:  \n\n\u2022 diffusing components should have analogous molecular diameters and molecular \n\nshape; \n\n\u2022 molecular interactions between the diffusion components should be negligible; \n\n\u2022 non-reacting components may be part of the system. \n\n(h) Interface boundary condition \n\nAfter the differential Eq. 2.14 has been integrated, constants of integration appear, and \n\nthese have to be determined by the use of boundary conditions.  \n\nIn the beginning of the diffusion test, the concentration of gas in the oil phase is equal to \n\nzero. So, the initial condition is assumed to be:  \n\nc(z, t)|t=0 = 0     0 ? z ? L 2.15 \n\nAt the bottom of the diffusion cell, the condition satisfying the impermeable boundary is \n\nthe one which the mass transfer flux at any time is equal to zero (Neumann Boundary Condition): \n\n?c\n?z\n?\nt=0\n\n= 0    t > 0 2.16 \n\n \n\nConcerning the interface gas-oil, accordingly to Tharanivasan (2006), three boundary \n\nconditions have been established for the interface mass transfer model. \n\nThe equilibrium boundary condition states that once the system is pressurized at the initial \n\npressure, the interface becomes saturated with gas under the equilibrium pressure (Dirichlet \n\nBoundary Condition): \n\nc(z, t)|z=L = csat?Peq?    t > 0 2.17 \n\n \n\nThis constant boundary condition is satisfactory only if the pressure decay is small. \n\n17 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nFor the quasi \u2013equilibrium boundary condition instead of the interface be saturated with \n\ngas at equilibrium pressure, it is saturated under the existing pressure. Now the Dirichlet \n\nboundary condition is stated in function of time as: \n\nc(z, t)|z=L = csat[P(t)]   t > 0 2.18 \n\nThe third type of boundary condition, the non-equilibrium one specifies that the gas mass \n\nflux across the interface is proportional to the difference between the gas concentration at the \n\nequilibrium pressure and the gas concentration at the interface. This proportionality in the so-\n\ncalled Robin boundary condition is the mass transfer coefficient at the gas-oil interface. Usually \n\nas described by Rasmussen and Civan (2008) most methods ignore film-mass-transfer-\n\ncoefficient. \n\nD\n?c\n?z\n?\nz=L\n\n= k ?csat?Peq? ?  c(z, t)|z=L?     t > 0 2.19 \n\nAnother Robin boundary condition, now time dependent, covers the whole range of \n\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium behaviors. cint(t) is the concentration in equilibrium with the \n\nvapor pressure in the gas cap remote from the surface. \n\nD\n?c\n?z\n?\nz=L\n\n= k [cint(t) ?  c(z, t)|z=L]     t > 0 2.20 \n\n2.5.1. Models Based on Pressure Decay Experiments \n\nAs described before, pressure decay is the most used method to obtain data that will be \n\nemployed in diffusion models. A brief overview of ten models based on pressure decay data will \n\nbe presented in this segment, followed by a summary in table 2.1. It is important to notice here \n\nthat most of the discussed models involve solvents in heavy oils, except the ones from Riazi \n\n(1996) and Haugen and Firoozabadi (2009). \n\n(a) Riazi (1996) \n\nRiazi was the first in 1996 to present the pressure decay method. His model had as major \n\nassumption that equilibrium exists between liquid and gas phases at their interface. Boundary \n\ncomposition changes as pressure changes, so the Dirichlet time dependent boundary condition \n\n18 \n \n\n\n\n \n\ntype was applied (Table 2.1). Once n-pentane was the component used to diffuse methane, \n\nswelling effect was considered. The objective of this model was to forecast gas-liquid interface \n\nand pressure during diffusion process. The diffusion coefficient was considered dependent on \n\nconcentration as time elapsed. Another important consideration was the equimolar counter-\n\ndiffusion, which means that when there is concentration gradient in the gas and liquid phases, \n\ndiffusion will take place in both phases. In summary, Riazi\u2019s model worked into time steps where \n\ndiffusion coefficient and liquid height inside the cell were constant. For each period, interface \n\nconcentration was obtained through PR-EoS using the data updated from pressure decay and \n\nheight of liquid. The final numerical solution of his model provides changes of the average \n\nconcentration and diffusion coefficient versus time. (Etminan et at., 2013) \n\n(b) Zhang et al. (2000) \n\nFew years after Riazi, Zhang et al. (2000) developed a simplified model. His study was \n\nbased on gas diffusion in heavy oils, therefore interface position was considered fixed assuming \n\nthat there was no swelling effect. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient was also considered \n\nconstant and diffusion process was considered unidirectional. The compressibility factor was also \n\nassumed to be constant since pressure change during the test was small. Zhang considered for \n\ntheir analytical solution a Dirichlet interface boundary condition as constant saturation \n\nconcentration at interface. To obtain diffusion coefficient, Zhang divided diffusion process in two \n\nstages, the first one, the incubation period, where pressure drops expressively and the second one \n\nwhere a straight line is obtained when experimental data is plotted on a semi-logarithm graph. \n\nThus Zhang studied only this second stage and obtained from it the diffusion coefficient.  \n\n(c) Upreti and Mehrotra (2000) \n\nAfter Zhang, Upreti and Mehrotra in 2000 also studied diffusion in heavy oils using \n\npressure decay method with CO2. They first determined CO2 experimental concentration in \n\nbitumen using a PVT relationship of the gas and the density of oil after diffusion started. To \n\nobtain the density, a correlation was proposed in this work. After experimental concentration is \n\nobtained, a numerical minimization of an objective function between experimental concentration \n\nand calculated one is used to find gas diffusivity. The calculated data is acquired by means of a \n\nmass transfer model, where diffusion coefficient is considered to be a function of gas \n\n19 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nconcentration in oil. Here the heavy oil is also assumed to be non-diffusing, volume change is \n\ntaken in consideration and concentration at interface varies according to time. \n\n(d) Sheika et al. (2005) \n\nThe same experimental data from Upretti and Mehrotra (2000) is used and two different \n\nmodels are developed involving an analogous approach to pressure diffusion behavior in \n\npetroleum reservoirs under single-phase flow conditions. So, from the infinite-acting model \n\nwhere diffusion coefficient is achieved, the gas penetration depth never reaches the bottom of the \n\npressure cell, establishing the boundary condition at the bottom. For the interface, the equilibrium \n\nbetween gas and oil is represented by Henry\u2019s law and a mass balance of the diffused gas is \n\nperformed to reach the interface boundary condition that is designated in Table 2.1.. Although, \n\ninfinite-acting model is valid only for early times, beyond this the model is not valid anymore. To \n\ndetermine this time, finite-acting model is carried out and the boundary condition at the bottom of \n\nthe cell establishes that there is no mass flux anymore.  \n\nTwo graphical methods are employed to obtain the relationship between diffusion \n\ncoefficient and Henry\u2019s constant, called combination factor. Those graphical methods are similar \n\nto well-testing reservoir permeability determination. After the combination factor is found, the \n\nHenry\u2019s constant is calculated through a correlation for the volume-basis gas solubility and then \n\ndiffusion coefficient can be acquired. \n\nThe main assumptions of this model are: a constant diffusion coefficient, swelling is \n\nnegligible, non-volatile oil and a constant gas compressibility factor. Based on those assumptions, \n\nthe error in estimating diffusion coefficient without swelling and with a constant compressibility \n\nfactor are also described in this work. An important remark that should be mentioned here is that \n\nfor CO2-heavy oil test the combined relative error in predicting pressures due to neglecting oil \n\nswelling and the constant gas compressibility factor was the greatest one (13% - 14%). \n\n(e) Civan and Rasmussen (2001, 2006, 2008) \n\nSince 2001, Civan and Rasmussen developed a mathematically robust diffusion model \n\nfrom Zhang. In 2006, they presented a diffusion model that considered resistance in gas/liquid \n\ninterface, and had several assumptions such as no swelling effect, incompressible gas/liquid \n\nsolution and constant diffusion coefficient. With those assumptions, two analytical solutions of \n\n20 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nmass accumulation of gas dissolved in liquid phase are proposed. They are based on two types of \n\nbottom conditions, namely the semi-infinite (short time) and finite length (long time) approaches. \n\nAn interpretation methodology is used with experimental data to obtain diffusion coefficient and \n\ninterface mass transfer coefficient. In 2008, they improved their model interpretation by \n\nconsidering only time-limited data which was independent of equilibrium conditions, being able \n\nalso to estimate equilibrium pressure and gas solubility. Both long-time and short-time \n\napproximations were used to evaluate parameters.  \n\n(f) Tharanivasan et al. (2006) \n\nIn this work, Zhang experimental data was investigated. The experimental data and \n\ntheoretically one were compared through a minimum objective function that was used to find the \n\ndiffusion coefficient. The main focus here was to investigate three kinds of interface boundary \n\nconditions that better adjust to each type of solvent interface diffusion conditions (CO2, CH4 and \n\npropane). Those boundaries conditions were previously studied by other authors: equilibrium \n\n(Zhang), quasi equilibrium (Riazi and Upretti and Mehrotra) and non-equilibrium (Civan and \n\nRasmussen).  \n\nAccordingly to Tharanivasan, the assumption of constant diffusion coefficient in the \n\nsolvent-saturated heavy oil was reasonable, because the solvent concentration in heavy oil is \n\ngenerally low under the test conditions. Furthermore both natural convection and swelling efect \n\nwere not considered, while unidirectional diffusion was applied. \n\nFor each boundary condition, Tharanivasan noticed in reported literature the \n\ncorrespondent solution for solvent concentration distribution in the oil. To obtain diffusion \n\ncoefficient, a history matching technique between experimental pressures and calculated ones \n\nwere used. The calculated pressure was established through an EoS for real gas.  Lee-Kesler \n\ncorrelation was then used to obtain compressibility factor. The number of moles of solvent \n\ndissolved into oil was obtained at any time by numerically integrating the transient solution for \n\neach boundary condition found by Tharanivasan. \n\nBefore diffusion coefficient determination, equilibrium pressure should be established as \n\nit will be used in the boundary conditions. In this work, equilibrium pressure was determined as a \n\nresult of a vapor-liquid equilibrium apparatus used to measure solubility and hence applying the \n\nEoS for the solvent phase at the equilibrium state. \n\n21 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nTo conclude, Tharanivasan noticed that for CO2-heavy oil system, the interfacial \n\nresistance varies with diffusion time. At early times of diffusion process, interface resistance is \n\nsignificant and non-equilibrium boundary condition can be considered. At large diffusion times, \n\nquasi equilibrium conditions are observed when history matching presents the best values.  \n\n(g) Haugen and Firoozabadi (2009) \n\nHaugen and Firoozabadi showed with their diffusion numerical model that a purely \n\ndiffusive model overestimates the liquid diffusion coefficient. Once, no natural convection \n\noccurs, the rate of mixing is governed by diffusion. On the other hand, after diffusion induces \n\nbulk velocity, convective mass transfer may still be important. This convective mass transport, \n\nwhich results in a local density change, is due to compressibility (dominates gas phase) and non-\n\nideality (dominates liquid phase, once the volume in mixing changes). Thus the two phases \n\nexchange mass as they equilibrate and consequently the pressure and liquid level in the PVT cell \n\nvary with time. The fact that the interface is moving was also taken in account. \n\nThe interface conditions are considered to be in local chemical equilibrium and because \n\nthere is a jump in composition, fugacity of a component in both phases should be same. \n\nThey also reported that to identify the influence from bulk mass transport, it was \n\nnecessary to use only a constant value of diffusion coefficient. By using variable diffusion \n\ncoefficients it was difficult to identify bulk mass transport contributions. To complement, they \n\nalso concluded that non-ideality and gas solubility have a great importance in liquid bulk mass \n\ntransport. And when a liquid component is nonvolatile there is hardly any diffusion in the gas \n\nphase. \n\n(h) Etminan et al. (2013) \n\nIn 2013, Etminan et al. published in a review a diffusion model that also considered an \n\ninterface resistance as Civan and Rasmussen proposed. But instead of having a third type Robin \n\nboundary condition based on equilibrium pressure, the present boundary condition was third type \n\nRobin time dependent. This time dependence shelters the entire change of equilibrium and non-\n\nequilibrium behaviors. \n\nDespite the several assumptions adopted on Etminan et al. (2013) model, this method was \n\nthe one chosen here as a startup model based on the time-dependent Robin type boundary \n\n22 \n \n\n\n\n \n\ncondition. The mathematical treatment as well as the assumptions will be described and discussed \n\nin details in the upcoming sections. \n\n23 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - Comparative between pressure decay models reported in literature \n\nRef.

Models Based on CT scan Experiments \n\nOnce CT-scan studies were run in parallel to pressure decay, a few of CT-scan models \n\nwill be described below.   \n\n(a) Wen and Kantzas, 2005 \n\nIn 2005, Wen and Kantzas studied diffusion process using both NMR and CAT \n\ntechniques. For CAT technique, the change in CT number observed during process delivers the \n\ndensity of the mixture within the oil column as described earlier in Eq. 2.4.  \n\nThey assumed that the diffusion coefficient of solvent was equal to the diffusion \n\ncoefficient of the oil, and then called it the overall diffusion coefficient. This overall diffusion \n\ncoefficient was studied as a constant and as a function of concentration. For constant coefficient \n\nstudy, they realized that it depends on concentration. On the other hand, for a diffusion \n\ncoefficient dependent on concentration, they used equation of continuity with Fick\u2019s law (Eq. \n\n2.14) through the same methodology followed by Oballa and Butler using Boltzmann \n\ntransformation. This transformation is valid for infinite and semi-infinite boundary conditions, \n\nwith interface boundary kept at constant concentration. With this transformation, the following \n\nequation is obtained as a particular solution of Eq. 2.14. \n\nD =  \n1\n2t\n\n \n?z\n?c\n? zdc\n\nc1\n\n0\n\n 2.21 \n\n(b) Guerrero-Aconcha et al., 2008 \n\nIn this work, the Matano-Boltzmann method is questioned due to the anomalous trend \n\nobserved for concentration dependent diffusion coefficient. In order to replace this method, they \n\nused the \u201cslopes and intercepts\u201d analytical method developed by Sarafianos (1986) to obtain the \n\ndiffusion coefficient of a liquid solvent (nC6, nC7 and nC8) in heavy oil. They assumed a \n\nconstant concentration at the interface along a semi-infinite system. \n\nThey proceeded also with a calibration test to obtain a curve (Eq. 2.4) where the densities \n\nof the scanned samples can be recalculated.  \n\n26 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nDespite the \u201cslopes and intercepts\u201d method being appropriately adjusted to liquid solvents \n\ndiffusion in heavy oil, this analytical method needs the concentration profile information in \n\nadvance. For diffusion of gas solvents in oil, the acquisition of the solvent concentration data in \n\noil is not an easy task as mentioned by Guerrero-Aconcha, 2009. None of the two Eq. 2.7 and Eq. \n\n2.8 can be used because Eq. 2.6 is not valid to obtain density mixture of gas in oil. \n\nThus, Guerrero-Aconcha chose to follow a non-iterative finite volume method developed \n\nby Chang et al. (2006) which was used by the later one to inverse estimate thermal conductivity \n\nin one-dimensional domain. In the case of Guerrero-Aconcha, instead of the thermal \n\nconductivity, they wanted to obtain the diffusion coefficient. The differential equation is \n\ntherefore transformed into a system of linear equations and solved using matrices. To solve these \n\nmatrices, the density data at discrete points was used.  \n\nThe choice here to employ density data instead of concentration was justified by the \n\nlimitations mentioned on the previous paragraph. In order to be able to use density as a \n\nreplacement for concentration, the equation of continuity with Fick\u2019s law was converted in the \n\nfollowing form (Eq. 2.22) after the assumption of a lineal approach dependency between \n\nconcentration and density. This assumption is based on Upreti and Mehrotra (2000) work where \n\nthe gas-bitumen mixture density was correlated from the experimental data into a linear equation. \n\n??\n?t\n\n=  \n?\n?z\n\n ?D\n??\n?z\n? 2.22 \n\n \n\n2.6. Swelling \nThe swelling effect of crude oil with CO2 increases the oil formation volume factor so \n\nthat residual oil after waterflooding is smaller in volume at surface conditions. Also, oil swelling \n\nwithin the pore spaces displaces water out of the pores, resulting in a decrease in the wetting \n\nphase saturation (drainage process). For water-wet porous media, relative permeabilities of the \n\ndrainage oil are higher than imbibition values, thus favoring additional oil recovery (Carcoana, \n\n1992). \n\nThe extent of the expansion or swelling is measured by the \u201cswelling factor\u201d, and this is \n\nused to calculate other properties of interest in enhanced oil recovery. There are few methods in \n\nliterature to predict CO2 solubility and swelling factors of crude. In 1965, Simon and Graue \n27 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\ndeveloped empirical correlations in graphical form to obtain CO2 solubility, fluid swelling, and \n\nviscosity data for pure CO2-oil mixtures. These correlations have some disadvantages \n\nconsidering the inconvenience for computer calculations and extrapolations out of the range of \n\nexperiments as they were empirical. \n\nDuring seventies, Katz and Firoozabadi and other authors treated CO2-oil system as a \n\nmixture of 10 to 40 recognizable components with known properties and compositions. Despite \n\nusing a simple equation of state to represent the system, they were able to acquire a complete \n\ndescription of vapor-liquid equilibrium. This multicomponent mixture nevertheless demands a \n\nhuge amount of computer time becoming quite costly (Teja and Sandler, 1980).  \n\nIn 1980, Teja proposed an extended corresponding stated method for saturated liquid \n\ndensities that was later applied to predict oil swelling factor in CO2-crude oil systems. In this \n\nsubsequent work, Teja and Sandler (1980) predicted the swelling factor of CO2-crude oil \n\nmixtures given the average boiling point or Watson K-factor and specific gravity of the crude and \n\nthe known properties of two references substances. By now treating the oil as a single pseudo-\n\ncomponent, they predicted solubility and swelling factors by using the Peng-Robinson equation \n\nof state.  \n\n2.6.1. Experimental Methods \n\nSwelling test is a special PVT laboratory test and is the most common multi-contact PVT \n\ntest (Aljarwan, 2012). During this test, a gas with known composition is injected into the oil at \n\nvarying proportions (quantified in terms of molar percentage). Then the following data is \n\nacquired:  \n\n\u2022 the relationship between saturation pressures and volume of gas injected; \n\n\u2022 the saturation pressure changes after a volume of gas is injected; \n\n\u2022 the volume change of the saturated fluid mixture in relation to the volume of the \n\noriginal saturated reservoir oil. \n\nIn the present work, the experimental method to measure swelling factor did not use a \n\nwindowed PVT cell and thus not all the data mentioned above was collected. The only \n\ninformation that was collected was the volume changes after the injection agent was added and \n\nmeasured through CT scan diagnosis. The current adopted methodology will be described in the \n\nMethods section. \n\n28 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n2.7. Models Optimization \nThis section will give a brief introduction about the two minimization methods that were \n\napplied to obtain the parameters from the chosen model described in Methods section.  \n\nAs stated in Silva Neto et al. (2010), the problem of parameter identification characterizes \n\na typical inverse problem in engineering. This happens because sometimes developing theoretical \n\nmodels based on physical phenomena and real operating conditions are quite challenging. Thus \n\nan inverse mass transfer problem needs to be treated by using different methodologies, such as \n\ndeterministic, stochastic and hybrid methods. So the inverse problem comprises the determination \n\nof the desired parameters through the use of experimental data for minimizing the residue \n\nbetween experimental and calculated values. \n\nBelow, two methods that were used in the Results and Discussion section will be quickly \n\ndescribed. \n\n2.7.1. Simulated Annealing Method (SA) \n\nThe essence of this method is an analogy with thermodynamics from freezing and \n\ncrystallization of liquids or cooling and annealing of metals. Mainly, the cooling procedure needs \n\nto be slow enough in order to reach the minimum energy level. For each iteration of this method, \n\na new point is randomly generated. The extend of the search is based on the so-called Boltzmann \n\nprobability distribution. As this algorithm admits additional points that raise the objective \n\nfunction, it avoids being stuck in local minima in early iterations and is also capable of exploring \n\nglobally for better solutions. \n\n2.7.2. Levenberg-Marquardt Method (LM) \n\nThis method is used to solve non-linear least square problems, especially in least squares \n\ncurve fitting. LM method is basically a combination between the Gauss-Newton algorithm and \n\nthe method of gradient descent, but it finds only a local minimum, not a global minimum. \n\n \n\nIn order to keep the best features of each method, Silva Neto et al. (2010) proposed a \n\ncombination of different methods, using SA as the global optimizer. In the case of LM and SA \n\ncombination, once LM reached a point of minimum, SA was placed to run. If the same solution \n\nwas found, it means that a global minimum has been reached and the iterative procedure was \n\n29 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nfinished. Although if a different solution was obtained from SA, it meant that the solution found \n\nin LM was not a global but rather a local minimum. Consequently, both methods were run again \n\nuntil the global minimum was reached. \n\n  \n\n30 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3. MATERIALS AND METHOD \n\nThe following chapter will describe all the equipment and materials employed during the \ntests as well as the experimental methods from the two selected techniques.  \n\n3.1.

Once it needed to be used inside a CT scanner, it \n\nwas constructed with x-ray transparent material, such as aluminum, and had a cylindrical shape to \n\nminimize CT reconstruction errors.  \n\nAs detailed in Figure 3.2 the aluminum diffusion cell was designed with the specifications \n\nfound in Table 3.2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Diffusion cell special design \n\n32 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nTable 3.2 - Diffusion Cell Specifications \n\nSPECIFICATIONS VALUE \n\nInternal diameter 38.1 mm \n\nExternal diameter 300  mm \n\nInternal height 114.7  \u00b1 0.3 mm \n\nMaterial \nDuralumin (AA2024, which contains 4.4% \ncopper, 1.5% magnesium, 0.6% manganese \n\nand 93.5% aluminum by weight) \n\nWorking pressure 41.37 MPa or 6000 psi \n\nO-ring type used Buna-N Nitrile Duro 90 Hard - Parker\u00ae \n\n \n\nAs depicted in Figure 3.3, the diffusion cell was mounted over an acrylic base and then \n\nthe whole assembly was installed on a fixed position over a wood table attached to CT bed. This \n\nentire installation allowed each CT image taken to be positioned in the same cross-sectional \n\nregion of interest (ROI) inside the diffusion cell. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Diffusion cell positioned inside CT gantry \n\n33 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n3.1. Experimental methods \nAs depicted in experimental setup, the diffusion process was monitored using both \n\npressure transducer and Siemens CT scanner. The pressure decay technique registered the \n\npressure drop inside the cell at a constant temperature as gas diffused and dissolved into the oil \n\ncolumn until the system reached the equilibrium. A diffusion cell was connected at the top and at \n\nthe bottom to two pressure bottles, from where the fluids were admitted. The pressure transducer \n\napparatus was calibrated and tested by manufacturer, so that no further calibration of the pressure \n\nsensor was performed. This pressure sensor has a 103.42 MPa or 15000 psi pressure module. \n\nWith this model, accuracy of operational range is illustrated in Table 3.3 (Online Crystal \n\nEngineering data sheet source). Once, this equipment was not appropriate to the present pressure \n\noperational range, there was a significant chance that measurement results could be affected by \n\nthis level of error. \n\nTable 3.3 \u2013 103.42 MPa Pressure Module Accuracy  \n\nOPERATIONAL RANGE ACCURACY \n\n0.10 to 31.13 MPa / 15 to 4515 psi \u00b1 0.035 MPa / \u00b1 5 psi \n\n31.13 to 103.52 MPa / 4515 to 15015 psi \u00b1 0.1% of reading \n\n \nSimultaneously to pressure decay measurement, CT-scan techniques were used to \n\ngenerate 2D images of the CO2-oil mixture. As CO2 diffuses into oil, the concentration gradient \n\ndistribution with distance can be acquired because the CT number varies during the process and \n\nrelates to the concentration of CO2 in the mixture. To directly relate CT with concentration, \n\nfirstly a relationship between CT number and densities need to be established, with this relation \n\nbeing defined by building a calibration curve with known densities. Afterward CT profile was \n\nrelated to density values, the next step was to obtain the correspondent CO2 concentration \n\nrelationship based on CO2-oil mixture density. Thenceforth, the concentration variation is \n\nobtained over the length of the oil column. This was made possible through CT scan image taken \n\nat each fixed interval during diffusion process. A region of interest (ROI) close to the CO2-oil \n\ninterface was designated inside the CT scan (See Figure 3.4). An average of horizontal CT \n\nnumbers generates a vertical profile that represents CT numbers change throughout the ROI at X-\n\nray image.  \n34 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Diffusion cell with ROI \n\nAs the used CT scanner was a medical one, there was no protocol available to be used in \n\nthe present work conditions. It was necessary to develop a special CT scan protocol to scan this \n\naluminum cell and enhance image quality as much as possible. The following table summarizes \n\nthe CT scan protocol parameters employed for the current measurements at 130 kV.  \n\nTable 3.4 - Protocol Parameters \n\nPARAMETERS OBSERVATIONS \nProtocol Name 'Cal_fluid_diff' \n\nFormat DICOM \n\nWidth 512 \n\nHeight 512 \n\nBitDepth 12 \n\nColorType grayscale \n\nBody Part Examined ABDOMEN \n\nSliceThickness 10 \n\nkVp 130 \n\nReconstructionDiameter 60 \n\nDistanceSourceToDetector 940 \n\nDistanceSourceToPatient 535 \n\nGantryDetectorTilt 0 \n\nTableHeight 155 \n\nXrayTubeCurrent 160 \n\nConvolutionKernel B30s \n\n35 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe calibration curve, CO2 concentration relationship with mixture density and CT-scan \n\ndata treatment will be subject of further discussion in the Results and Discussion subsection for \n\nCT scan method investigation. \n\nBefore starting all the experiments, the diffusion cell assembly was pressured tested with \n\nnitrogen at 1.38 MPa (2000 psi) and at room temperature 293.15 K (20oC) inside a water bath. \n\nAnd before each experiment, the diffusion cell and lines were cleaned with kerosene, with \n\nalcohol and vented with compressed air. Later, CO2 was vented from top to the bottom of the cell \n\nand a small amount of pressure (0.013 \u2013 0.027 MPa / 2 \u2013 4 psi) was left inside the cell chamber. \n\nAfter this \u201catmosphere\u201d of CO2 was left inside the cell, crude oil was injected from the bottom \n\ncell entrance until it reaches around 60 mL of pumped oil, rigorously checked through a beaker \n\nbefore and after oil injection started. A rate of 5mL/min oil injection was chosen to minimize \n\nCO2 convective forced mass transfer into oil due to fluid movement. CT scans were taken during \n\noil pumping to check for any modification in oil CT numbers. \n\nImmediately after the column of oil was pumped inside the cell, the CO2 was injected \n\nfrom the top entrance until it reached the desired initial pressure. Here, the CO2 pump injection \n\nrate was controlled to be around 0.023 MPa/s (200 psi/min) remaining with the same purpose to \n\nprevent forced convection mentioned in the paragraph above. Right after the CO2 injection was \n\nfinished, the first scan was taken and this image represented the CT number at the initial pressure \n\n(pi) and initial time (t=0). The end of the diffusion process was here defined as when a variation \n\nof no more than 0.007 MPa (1 psi) could be observed every 30 minutes during the following \n\nthree hours. The entire process of filling the cell is short compared with the duration of the \n\nexperiment, and hence it is assumed that mass transfer between the phases during the injection of \n\nboth fluids is negligible. \n\n3.1.1. Experiments at 293.15 K (20oC) \n\nAlmost all the tests were performed at the room temperature of 293.15 K (20oC). A \n\nthermocouple was attached close to the cell to be able to verify the stability of room temperature \n\n(see Figure 3.3). Only the last test was executed at 338.15 K (65oC), where thermal blankets were \n\nused to maintain temperature in the diffusion cell and in the pressure bottle where the CO2 was \n\npressurized. \n\n36 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe first two tests at 293.15 K (20oC) were done with dead oil in its original composition. \n\nThe initial pressures applied to each test were 5.31 MPa (770 psi) and 6.89 MPa (1000 psi). In the \n\nformer, CO2 was still in its gas phase while in the latter test CO2 was already in the liquid phase \n\n(see Attachment A for isothermal properties for CO2 from NIST). Although in both experiments, \n\nthe diffusion process end up in equilibrium pressure, CT attenuation values were not able to \n\nidentify the CO2 concentration in oil.  \n\n(a) Using original oil \n\nThus, for the next steps the crude dead oil was doped with iododecane (4% in volume) to \n\nenhance CT attenuation in order to detect the CO2 dissolution in oil. Other amounts of \n\niododecane were tested (1% and 10%), but the one with 4% showed to be the optimal \n\nconcentration of dopant that on one hand will not significantly change the oil composition \n\n(density = 0.893 g/cm3 @ 20oC and atmospheric pressure) and on the other hand will still enable \n\nCT attenuation identification along the diffusion process.  \n\n(b) Using doped oil \n\nSo, after oil was doped, experiments were performed at 3.03, 5.31, 9.65 and 28.96 MPa \n\n(440, 770, 1400 and 4200 psi). For the first three pressure levels, CO2 is lighter than the oil and \n\ntherefore it was injected through the top after the oil was pumped through the bottom, and \n\npressure was also monitored in the upper cell connection. As for the 28.96 MPa (4200 psi) level, \n\nCO2 is heavier than the oil so that, at this pressure level, the fluid was firstly injected and then the \n\nsystem was filled with oil from the top. The pressure in this case was monitored in the lower cell \n\nconnection. The doped oil experiments presented a limitation that will be further subject of \n\ndiscussion in section 5. The last goal was to perform diffusion test under a similar reservoir \n\nconditions. \n\n3.1.2. Experiments at 338.15 K (65oC) \n\nThe pressure chosen a close to reservoir condition was 10.36 MPa (1500 psi) and the \n\ntemperature was 338.15 K (65oC). In such levels, CO2 was on its supercritical condition. The \n\ndead oil used was from the same original samples taken for experiments performed at 293.15 K \n\nbefore the doped oil was used. \n\n37 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n38 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n4. THEORETICAL MODELING \n\n4.1. Pressure Decay  \nAs stated earlier, the pressure-decay technique used in the present work follows Etminan \n\net al. (2013) procedure. The next theoretical model presented was a short-term summary, for \n\nsupplementary information address to Etminan et al. (2013) and Etminan (2012).  \n\nFor the diffusion model with interface resistance in isothermal conditions throughout the \n\npressure-decay experiment, the use of Fick\u2019s law is reasonable just after some assumptions are \n\napplied, as presented in the work from Etminan et al. (2013): \n\n(i) No chemical reaction between the oil and the gas; \n\n(ii) No natural convection; \n\n(iii) Swelling is negligible; \n\n(iv) Gas diffusion is unidirectional; \n\n(v) Diffusion coefficient is constant; \n\n(vi) Gas compressibility factor is constant; \n\n(vii) Solution density remains constant. \n\nConsidering the geometry of the cell depicted in Figure 4.1 and the mentioned hypothesis, \n\ndiffusion was modeled as: \n\nFick\u2019s law \n?2Cg\n?z2\n\n=  \n1\nD\n\n \n?Cg\n?t\n\n 4.1 \n\nInitial condition Cg(z, t = 0) = 0 4.2 \n\nBoundary condition at bottom \n?Cg\n?z\n\n?\nz=h\n\n= 0 4.3 \n\nBoundary condition at interface ?D\n?Cg\n?z\n\n= k (Cg?int(t) ?  Cg(z = 0, t)) 4.4 \n\n39 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - Diffusion cell \n\nThe boundary condition at the interface represents the non-instantaneous thermodynamic \n\nequilibrium. As the gas concentration in vapor pressure equilibrium (Cg?int(t)) is not the same as \n\nthe gas concentration below the interface (Cg(z = 0, t)), a resistance to the mass transfer is \n\nrepresented by the film mass transfer resistance coefficient (1/k). \n\nThe gas concentration in equilibrium above the interface is given by Henry\u2019s law: \n\nCg?int(t) =  \np(t)\n\nH\n 4.5 \n\nThe boundary condition at interface presented in Eq. 4.4 is modified into Eq. 4.6 to be \n\nused in the next diffusion equation solution (Etminan et al., 2013). \n\n?Cg\n?z\n\n= M\n?Cg\n?t\n\n?

(1 + Ns)?s D? )]\n 4.9 \n\nAfterwards by using Henry\u2019s law constant to replace concentration by pressure it is also \n\npossible to have the pressure calculated with the equation in Laplace space (Etminan et al., 2013): \n\np?computed(s) =  \nM?i[?e\n\n??2h?s D? ? + 1? ?

(1 + Ns)?s D? )]\n 4.10 \n\nPressure variation with time can be calculated from Eq. 4.10 by using numerical methods \n\nsuch as Stehfest algorithm to invert the Laplace transform. The results are the theoretical values \n\nrendered by the diffusion model. Results are affected by the parameters of mass transfer \n\ncoefficient (k), Henry constant (H) and diffusion coefficient (D). \n\nAn objective function was used to obtain the best values of parameters: \n\nSquared Error = ?(pexp(t) ? pcomputed(t))2\nn\n\ni=1\n\n 4.1 \n\nAn elaborated method of fitting is necessary to render the optimum set of parameters for \n\nthe large amount of data collected. The minimization method used to obtain the global minimum \n\nwas the simulated annealing. This method was used to define the following three unknown \n\nvalues: mass transfer coefficient (k), Henry constant (H) and diffusion coefficient (D). The \n\ncombination of two minimization methods will be later elucidated during Result and Discussion \n\nfor Pressure Decay subsection. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n41 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n42 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nAt this chapter, the results from pressure decay and CT scan are presented. The obtained \n\ndata in both experiments is analyzed in order to evaluate its accuracy to be adjusted to a \n\ntheoretical model to generate diffusion parameters. CT scan is also used to collect data from \n\nswelling effect. By the end of this chapter, a brief GC analysis is performed with the aim to detect \n\nmass transfer process in the opposite path of CO2 diffusion. \n\n5.1. Pressure Decay  \nIn a first step here, the pressure decay data quality is examined during Preliminary \n\nAnalysis. Afterwards the diffusion coefficient and other parameters are obtained from model \n\nadjustment with these records and are illustrated in Data Analysis. Later, a sensitivity analysis is \n\nalso developed considering the model. Finally, from those parameters, a CO2 concentration study \n\ninside the oil column is performed using also concentration solution for the chosen model. \n\n5.1.1. Preliminary Analysis \n\nThe table in the next page summarizes all tests accomplished in the sequence they were \n\nperformed. Such order was in fact established during the CT scan investigation and the \n\ndifferences between them were oil type, the way oil was added inside the diffusion cell and the \n\ninitial conditions of each experiment (temperature and pressure).  \n\n  \n\n43 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Experimental Data for Pressure Decay \n\nNo. OIL TYPE \n\nOIL \nADDED \nINSIDE \n\nTHE \nCELL \n\nTEMP. \n(K) \n\nINITIAL \nPRESSURE \n(pi) (MPa) \n\nFINAL \nPRESSURE \n\n(pf) \n(MPa) \n\nFINAL \nTIME \n\n(h) \n\n1 Original Pump 293.15 5.31 3.57 49.14 \n\n2 Original Beaker 293.15 5.28 4.43 47.23 \n\n3 Original Pump 293.15 6.94 5.51 50.59 \n\n4 \nLight \n\ncomponents \nremoved (LCR) \n\nPump 293.15 5.29 4.29 161.16 \n\n5 LCR doped 4% Beaker 293.15 5.31 4.94 69.41 \n\n6 Doped 1% Beaker 293.15 5.25 4.32 250.68 \n\n7 Doped 10% Beaker 293.15 5.24 4.78 52.69 \n\n8 Doped 4% Pump 293.15 2.81 1.72 43.51 \n\n9 Doped 4% Pump 293.15 5.26 3.89 19.79 \n\n10 Doped 4% (Dupli.)

In a first \n\nstep, experimental data obtained with an initial pressure of 5.31 MPa (770 psi) is analyzed, as \n\ndepicted in the next figure. \n\n44 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 - Pressure decay profiles for 5.31 MPa initial pressure scenarios \n\nSome of the pressure decay experiments presented in Figure 5.1 may not have reached the \n\nequilibrium pressure, namely experiments 1, 7 and 9. Once the saturation pressure was not \n\nattained, experimental results were probably affected as well as parameters modeling reliability. \n\nOther experiments may not present the same pressure decay trend profile, like experiments 4 and \n\n5, where a different profile is noticed after each curve is plotted. This different profile may \n\nrepresent a leak. \n\nIt is noticed that oil on its original composition has the highest pressure drop since it has the \n\nlower density value. So doped oil has lower pressure decay if compared to non-doped oil. So the \n\ndenser the oil is, like experiments 5 and 7, the smallest is the pressure drop, with less diffusion of \n\nCO2 into oil. \n\nThe conditions under which oil was added inside the cell were also checked, with oil being \n\nadded in two different ways inside the diffusion cell. The first one consists of pumping oil into \n\none of cell\u2019s entries and the other by pouring oil with a beaker. The aim here was to analyze if \n\npumping oil inside the cell with a CO2 atmosphere changed the oil composition.  It is detected \n\n45 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nthat without pumping the oil, the pressure drop was less than the expected (experiments 2, 6 and \n\n7). \n\nRepeatability was only checked for experiments with doped oil at 5 MPa range \n\n(experiments 9, 10 and 11) where pressure profiles observed during diffusion process follow the \n\nsame qualitative trend.  \n\nFor pressures where CO2 is already on its liquid phase (CO2 pressure @ 293.15 K or 20oC \n\n> 5.73 MPa or 831 psi), pressure profiles are extremely sensitive to temperature variations (see \n\nFigure 5.2). At this temperature and higher pressures, CO2 is closer to its critical point (Tc = \n\n304.1 K and pc = 7.38 MPa \u2013 See Attachment A). Consequently, minor temperature variations \n\nmay lead here to major pressure changes. It is important to mention here that the thermocouple \n\nused in the temperature measurement was attached to external diffusion cell wall. \n\n \nFigure 5.2 - Pressure decay profiles instabilities for high pressures \n\nWith the aim of reducing temperature variations during 293.15 K (20oC) tests, the whole \n\nsystem was placed inside a heating thermal blanket, while the room temperature was set to lower \n\nvalue and monitored with the thermocouple. Such conditions were valid for the test performed at \n\n46 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n10.34 MPa (1500 psi) and 338.15 K (65oC). Thus as seen in Figure 5.3, if experiment 12 at \n\n293.15 K (20oC) is compared with the one at 338.15 K (65oC), it is clear that the latter one \n\nproduces more reliable and stable data. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 - Pressure decay profiles for experiments 12 and 14 scenarios \n\nAnother observation that can be extracted from Figure 5.3 is that the pressure drop in 10.34 \n\nMPa (1500 psi) and 338.15 K (65oC) test is smaller than that one with 9.95 MPa (1443 psi), \n\n293.15 K (20oC). This may have happened because of high temperature 338.15 K (65oC) and also \n\nbecause during the experiment, oil was left 24h inside the diffusion cell to stabilize temperature.  \n\n5.1.2. Data Analysis \n\nIt is worthwhile to mention that Etminan et al. (2013) diffusion model, chosen to be applied \n\nhere, has several limitations concerning the here presented experimental conditions, such as high \n\npressures and light crude oils. \n\nWith pressure data presented in the previous section, experimental profiles were adjusted to \n\nthe model for obtaining the desired parameters using a routine implemented in Matlab\u00ae (see code \n47 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nin Appendix A). Firstly Levenberg-Maquardt (LM) was utilized as an initial minimization \n\nmethod to find local minimum. For experiments with higher pressure, the convergence of the \n\nthree parameters could nevertheless not be achieved. Besides this, as LM method has no \n\nboundary restrictions, during some 5.31 MPa experiments, the obtained mass transfer coefficient \n\nvalues were out of the expected range. In regard to this last issue, a sensitivity analysis is \n\nperformed by the end of this section. \n\nThe present minimization method choice was the Simulated Annealing, which requires \n\nsetting a range of initial parameters to start the algorithm. Once it randomly investigates the \n\nvalues inside the selected range to identify the global minimum; it attempts to improve the global \n\nminimum obtained earlier, by narrowing the range. \n\nBesides the experimental pressure profile, other experimental information is demanded as \n\ninput values in order to the calculate diffusion coefficient, mass transfer coefficient and Henry \n\nconstant. Such inputs are the gas cap volume, height of oil column and compressibility factor. \n\nOnce the diffusion cell was not windowed, the first two input factors were obtained using CT-\n\nscan, with details presented in the upcoming swelling subsection. On the other hand the \n\ncompressibility factor is considered constant and was found using PR-EoS with initial pressure \n\nand constant temperature as EoS entry variables. \n\nFigure 5.4 and Figure 5.5 illustrate experimental data adjustment, through simulated \n\nannealing, using Etminan et al. (2013) model. Figure 5.4 is better suited for experimental data \n\nonce after equilibrium pressure was reached; it was also maintained for a while. The other \n\nexperiments adjustment figures is listed in Appendix B. \n\n48 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.4 \u2013 Experiment 8 adjustment to model (2.81 MPa) \n\n \nFigure 5.5 \u2013 Experiment 12 adjustment to model (9.95 MPa) \n\n49 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nHereafter, the estimated parameters that best fit Etminan model with experimental data are \n\ndescribed in Table 5.2 and Table 5.3 with literature parameters for comparison purpose. \n\nTable 5.2 \u2013 Estimated parameters obtained from Pressure Decay Data \n\nNo. OIL TYPE \nT \n\n(K) \npi \n\n(MPa) D (m\n2/s) k (m/s) H (MPa/(kg/m3)) \n\nSQUARED \nERROR \n\n1 Original 293.15 5.31 1.41 x 10-8 9.48 x 10-4 2.72 x 10-2 9.86 x 10-2 \n\n2 Original 293.15 5.28 2.82 x 10-8 1.69 x 10-4 8.10 x 10-2 6.23 x 10-2 \n\n3 Original 293.15 6.94 1.68 x 10-8 8.79 x 10-4 1.58 x 10-2 3.20 x 10-2 \n\n4 LCR 293.15 5.29 4.10 x 10-9 8.36 x 10-5 4.75 x 10-2 7.48 x 10-2 \n\n5 LCR doped 4% 293.15 5.31 7.88 x 10\n-9 9.89 x 10-5 1.54 x 10-1 3.40 x 10-2 \n\n6 Doped 1% 293.15 5.25 4.28 x 10-8 1.06 x 10-5 7.98 x 10-2 5.70 x 10-2 \n\n7 Doped 10% 293.15 5.24 7.73 x 10\n-9 1.50 x 10-5 1.65 x 10-1 3.59 x 10-3 \n\n8 Doped 4% 293.15 2.81 6.40 x 10-8 7.44 x 10-6 5.26 x 10-2 2.70 x 10-3 \n\n9 Doped 4% 293.15 5.26 7.96 x 10-7 3.71 x 10-6 6.71 x 10-2 7.79 x 10-3 \n\n10 Doped 4% (Dupli.) 293.15 5.27 9.53 x 10\n-7 3.94 x 10-6 7.35 x 10-2 1.30 x 10-2 \n\n11 Doped 4% (Tripli.) 293.15 5.31 1.22 x 10\n-7 5.74 x 10-6 6.03 x 10-2 1.86 x 10-2 \n\n12 Doped 4% 293.15 9.95 5.37 x 10-8 8.62 x 10-4 2.05 x 10-2 1.79 x 10-1 \n\n13 Doped 4% 293.15 28.96 2.50 x 10-8 6.71 x 10-4 2.18 x 10-1 6.26 x 10-2 \n\n14 Original 338.15 10.36 3.09 x 10-8 9.27 x 10-4 2.20 x 10-1 4.85 x 10-2 \n\nTable 5.3 - Estimated parameters in Etminan analysis used for comparison purpose \n\nWORKS pi (MPa) / T (K) D (m2/s) k (m/s) \nH \n\n(MPa/(kg/m3)) \nRiazi, 1996 10.20 / 310.95  1.12 x 10-8 a 9.2 x 10-6 a 0.1097 a \nHaugen and \nFiroozabadi, \n\n2009 \n10.20 / 310.95  1.30 x 10-8 - - \n\nGhaderi et al., \n2011 8 / 348.15 1 x 10\n\n-9 - 10 \n\nGuo et al., 2009 20 / 333.15 1.87e x 10-11 - - \nEtminan et al., \n\n2013 4 / 348.15 5.00 x 10\n-10 1.50 x 10-6 0.11 \n\na calculated by Etminan et al. (2013) \n\n50 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEven though the experimental conditions used in the present work have never been tested \n\nbefore in literature, the estimated diffusion coefficients have the same order of magnitude of \n\nthose presented in Table 5.3 and are similar to those ones from Riazi (1996) and Haugen and \n\nFiroozabadi (2009) once both experiments also used lighter components than heavy oil, as \n\nemployed by Etminan et al. (2013). \n\nAlmost all the adjustments presented in Table 5.2 are quite accurate as illustrated by the \n\nsquared errors oscillation in the range of 1x10-2. \n\nFor experimental conditions with 2.81 MPa (440 psi) and 5.31 MPa (770 psi) initial \n\npressures, Etminan Model is well suited as those pressures fall in a similar pressure range of \n\nEtminan analysis. Consequently, they are still at VLE and then Henry law can be employed if \n\nmixture is considered sufficiently diluted. But since the swelling effect is noticed, in some way it \n\nmay affect the adjustment with experimental data.  \n\nOnce the diffusion coefficient represents how smoothly the solvent can diffuse into oil \n\nbody; it is noticed, according to Table 5.2, that heavier oils (experiments 4, 5 and 7) are the only \n\nones with diffusion coefficients in the order of magnitude of 1x10-9 which means that for denser \n\noils CO2 propagates in the oil column slowly than in lighter oils. \n\nRegarding the mass transfer coefficient (k), 1/k is defined as the interfacial resistance \n\nagainst the gas molecular diffusion. Half of them have an order of magnitude of 1 x 10-4, and \n\nalmost all doped oil experiments presented in the range of 1 x 10-5 and 1 x 10-6. Relating these \n\norders of magnitude to those ones obtained by Etminan et al. (2013), the resistance at the \n\ninterface may be neglected for all practical purposes when larger than 1 x 10-4. Thus including \n\nmass transfer coefficient into the model for such values may not necessarily and physically \n\nrepresent interface resistance. \n\nFor relatively low pressures and dilute solutions, ideal gas phase behavior can be assumed \n\nand then Henry constant is inversely proportional to the equilibrium concentration at a given \n\npressure. Consequently, as Henry\u2019s constant increases (solubility decreases), the gas pressure \n\ndrops at a lower rate. For pressures up to 5 MPa, the effects of pressure on Henry\u2019s constant are \n\nquite small and it can be considered that it is solely a function of temperature. For higher values \n\nof Henry\u2019s law constant, it is expected that solubility decreases and then the predicted gas cap \n\npressure decay is shorter, as demonstrated in the Table 5.4.  \n\n51 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nTable 5.4 \u2013 Pressure drop increases and Henry constant decreases tendency \n\nNo. OIL TYPE T (K) pi (MPa) PRESSURE DROP (MPa) \n\nHENRY \nCONSTANT \n\n(MPa/(kg/m3)) \n5 LCR doped 4% 293.15 5.31 0.37 1.72 x 10-1 \n\n7 Doped oil 10% 293.15 5.24 0.46 1.65 x 10-1 \n\n2 Original 293.15 5.28 0.85 8.10 x 10-2 \n\n6 Doped oil 1% 293.15 5.25 0.93 7.98 x 10-2 \n\n10 Doped oil 4% (2) 293.15 5.27 1.28 7.35 x 10-2 \n\n9 Doped oil 4% 293.15 5.26 1.37 6.71 x 10-2 \n\n11 Doped oil 4% (3) 293.15 5.31 1.54 6.03 x 10-2 \n\n1 Original 293.15 5.31 1.74 2.72 x 10-2 \n \n\nAs mentioned previously, Henry\u2019s Law can just be satisfactorily used to express solubility \n\nfor dilute solutions, and then it is limited by the thermodynamics of the system. On the other \n\nhand, for mixtures that largely deviate from the ideal behavior, EoS models are used to represent \n\nphase equilibria and then are applied for solubility calculations. In this sense, rather than have \n\nHenry\u2019s constant as a third parameter in the diffusion model, it  would be better to estimate it  by \n\nusing an EoS. Under these circumstances, the other two missing parameters from the model, D \n\nand k, could be evaluated more precisely. \n\nAn acceptable adjustment to Etminan Model requires pressure saturation to be well \n\nestablished. If the theoretical curve for each experiment is extrapolated and the final pressure is \n\nfar from the one at theoretical equilibrium, those experiments have their parameters reliability \n\naffected.

This study determines CO2 concentration variation along oil \n\ncolumn either at a fixed time or in a fixed position with varying time. In Figure 5.8 and Figure \n\n5.9, the CO2 concentration distribution during time and along oil column is illustrated for \n\nexperiment 1 with original oil at 5.31 MPa (770 psi) and 293.15 K (20oC). \n\n \nFigure 5.8 \u2013 CO2 concentration at a fixed position in oil column during time \n\n55 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9 \u2013 CO2 concentration at a fixed time varying along oil column \n\nAccordingly to Figure 5.8, at early times, it seems that the CO2 concentration close to the \n\ninterface is higher than the equilibrium concentration. As diffusion progresses, pressure \n\ndecreases, and this concentration tends to equilibrium. At Figure 5.9, it is clear that CO2 reached \n\nthe cell bottom. In both studies (Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9), concentration values higher than \n\nsaturation may happen due to the absence of swelling in the model, meaning that the transition \n\nzone, where the amount of CO2 should be dissolved, is underestimated in its size. All the other \n\nexperiments have similar curves, only concentration values change, as showed in next page in \n\nTable 5.6.  \n\n  \n\n56 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nTable 5.6 \u2013 CO2 % in mass in oil column at the end of each experiment \n\nNo OIL TYPE T (K) \npi \n\n(MPa) \npf \n\n(MPa) \nFINAL \n\nTIME (h) \nFINAL CO2 \n\nCONCENTRATION \n(kg/m3) \n\nOIL \nDENSITY \n\n(kg/m3) \n\nCO2 \n(% in \nmass) \n\n1 Original 293.15 5.31 3.57 49.14 134.5 876 15.01 \n\n2 Original 293.15 5.28 4.43 47.23 54.8 876 6.82 \n\n3 Original 293.15 6.94 5.51 50.59 339.5 876 30.08 \n\n4 LCR 293.15 5.29 4.29 161.16 93.38 886 11.23 \n\n5 LCR doped 4% 293.15 5.31 4.94 69.41 31.64 903 4.10 \n\n6 Doped 1% 293.15 5.25 4.32 250.68 52.44 882 6.45 \n\n8 Doped 10% 293.15 2.81 1.72 43.51 33.7 893 3.78 \n\n9 Doped 4% 293.15 5.26 3.89 19.79 57.33 893 6.87 \n\n10 Doped 4% 293.15 5.27 3.99 41.8 55.92 893 6.72 \n\n11 Doped 4% (Dupli.) 293.15 5.31 3.77 40.36 70.17 893 8.22 \n\n12 Doped 4% (Tripli.) 293.15 9.95 6.90 63.8 355.58 893 31.03 \n\n13 Doped 4% 293.15 28.96 27.85 32.11 123.52 893 12.89 \n\n14 Doped 4% 338.15 10.36 9.03 74.73 40.84 876 5.17 \n\n \n\n  \n\n57 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5.1.3. Sensitivity analysis \n\nThe sensitivity analysis of parameters is motivated by the fact that the obtained mass \n\ntransfer coefficients (1 x 10-4 m/s &lt;k ) are out of the expected range  (1 x 10-4 m/s > k > 1 x 10-8 \n\nm/s) of values using the LM method for experiment 1 data. \n\nTo better comprehend what was noticed above, a sensitivity analysis of the effect from \n\nthose three parameters (k, H and D) on the behavior of the analytical solution is examined. All \n\ndata obtained for the predicted gas cap pressure versus time for each case is compared to the base \n\ncase parameters obtained for experiment 1. \n\nIn Table 5.7 , the base case parameters and value of each case are listed. \n\nTable 5.7 \u2013 Base case for experiment 1 and values for each case for sensitive analysis \n\nPARAMETERS  k EFFECT  (m/s) \nD EFFECT  \n\n(m2/s) \nH EFFECT \n\n(MPa/(kg/m3)) \n\n1 1.00 x 10-7 1.00 x 10-9 1.00 x 10-2 \n\n2 1.00 x 10-6 9.00 x 10-9 2.00 x 10-2 \n\nBase Case Experiment 1 9.48 x 10-4 1.41 x 10-8 2.72 x 10-2 \n\n4 1.00 x 10-2 1.00 x 10-7 3.00 x 10-2 \n\n5 1.00 x 102 1.00 x 10-6 4.00 x 10-1 \n\n \n\nAs it was mentioned earlier, when mass transfer coefficient is larger, resistance at the \n\ninterface becomes insignificant. For mass transfer coefficients higher than the one from the base \n\ncase, it can be noticed that the squared error is very close to the best case and will remain the \n\nsame for values higher than the base case (see Figure 5.10). Physically, it is possible to say that \n\ndiffusion is dominant over interface resistance, so that CO2 diffuses into oil almost \n\ninstantaneously.  \n\n58 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.10 \u2013 Effect of mass transfer coefficient on predicted gas cap pressure \n\nPerforming an analogy to heat transfer, diffusion coefficient can be compared to the \n\nconductance resistance of oil column towards CO2 molecules\u2019 diffusion. So for reduced values of \n\ndiffusion coefficient, concentration saturation takes longer to be reached along the oil column and \n\nthen equilibrium time will become also longer, as seen by magenta profile in Figure 5.11.  \n\n59 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.11 - Effect of diffusion coefficient on predicted gas cap pressure \n\nThe results in Figure 5.12 illustrate that the gas pressure drop is lower as Henry\u2019s constant \n\nincreases. So for smaller values of Henry\u2019s constant, a larger amount of CO2 is dissolved into oil. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.12 - Effect of Henry\u2019s constant on predicted gas cap pressure \n\n60 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5.2. CT scan \n\n5.2.1. Data treatment \n\nAfter a special protocol was created to scan the diffusion cell with oil inside, each image \n\nexported from CT scan software was opened in Matlab as a 512 x 512 matrix. Figure 5.13 \n\ndescribes the area inside the cell where CT scan acquires the image and how the image is \n\nvisualized in Matlab?.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.13 \u2013 Image scanned from CT to Matlab \n\nFirst a conversion of the original file from the CT-scan software in DICOM (Digital \n\nImaging and Communications in Medicine) format was performed. A couple of pixel \n\ntransformations were required to convert pixel value in the file to Hounsfield units (H.U).  \n\nAs previously explained, after a ROI area close to the CO2-oil interface was selected, a \n\nvertical profile was generated to be compared to other images profiles as is demonstrated in the \n\nnext picture. \n\n61 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.14 \u2013 Diffusion cell zones and CT number vertical profile \n\nWhen focusing the analysis only on the oil column, it is possible to observe significant \n\nartifact effects on image quality. One possible assumption here is that this error was mainly \n\ninduced by aluminum walls thickness and by the vertical positioning of the cell. Further data \n\ntreatment is therefore required to minimize such error.  \n\nIn a first step, the optimal area of the ROI inside the cell is selected in order to be narrow \n\nenough to reduce aluminum wall effect and sufficiently large to increase the data range used in \n\neach horizontal average. Below is depicted the delimitation of such area.   \n\n \n\nFigure 5.15 \u2013 ROI selection \n62 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDue to observed artifacts near the bottom of the cell, an additional error compensation is \n\nperformed, namely subtracting the original obtained matrix from a correction matrix. Such \n\ncorrection matrix in turn is calculated by subtracting the matrix result with the cell filled with air \n\nfrom the CT values from the air alone. In Figure 5.16, the green line represents the original \n\nmeasured profile while the green blue one illustrates the result of the data treatment.     \n\n \n\nFigure 5.16 \u2013 Error removal of CT profile in oil column experiment 1 \n\nFinally, all images exported from CT-scan software are treated using a code to generate the \n\ndesired profile. This process is detailed in a Matlab? code described in Appendix C. \n\n5.2.2. Data Analysis \n\nThe first two experiments were performed with dead oil at initial pressure of 5.31 MPa (770 \n\npsi) (with CO2 in gas phase) and  6.94 MPa (1006 psi) (with CO2 in liquid phase), both  at  \n\n293.15 K.  \n\nIn Figure 5.17, the plot represents each scan vertical profile of the CO2 gas and oil phases \n\nduring diffusion process. It is possible to observe at each profile the interface displacement \n63 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\ncaused by swelling effect. Once all interfaces are aligned, Figure 5.18 is plotted. There the \n\nincrease of the CT-number of CO2 phase can be clearly observed due to the increase of pressure.    \n\n \nFigure 5.17 \u2013 Profiles of gas cap, interface and oil column of experiment 1 \n\n \nFigure 5.18 \u2013 Experiment 1 with interfaces aligned \n\n64 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nZooming in the area inside oil column, without interface alignment, Figure 5.19 is \n\ngenerated. Those CT peaks represent when two components density values are very distinct.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.19 \u2013 Experiment 1 profiles with original oil at initial pressure of 5.31 MPa. \n\nFrom Figure 5.19, it is not possible to notice a representative CT variance that shows \n\ndensity decay due to CO2 dissolution in oil. Each profile above also presents a different value for \n\nits random error. For this experiment the average error was around 18 H.U without considering \n\nthe peak at top of the oil column and the CT numbers decrease at the bottom of the cell.  \n\nIn the case of the experiment with 6.94 MPa (1006 psi), as depicted next, the random error \n\nwas higher at around 10 H.U. At the beginning of this experiment when cell was pressurized at \n\ninitial pressure, the peaks observed in the previous figure were reduced. Additionally, in Figure \n\n5.20, it is possible to observe a slight increment in CT number profiles as the process takes place. \n\nThis last observation is the opposite from what was expected, while the diffusion process is \n\noccurring.  \n\n65 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.20 - Experiment 3 profiles with original oil at initial pressure of 6.94 MPa. \n\nWhile the interface movement in both experiments can be clearly noticed, the expected CT \n\nprofile decrease during diffusion process caused by density reduction is not noticed in both \n\nexperiments with original oil.  \n\nBefore moving to another alternative to detect a reasonable CT number variation, it is \n\nnecessary to investigate the relationship between the expected CT variation due to density \n\ndecrease and the random error. Thus, in the next figure, a calibration curve at an energy level of \n\n130 kV is plotted with the present Siemens Spirit Somaton scanner in use. \n\n66 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.21 \u2013 Calibration curve at 130 kV for Siemens CT-scan \n\nAfterwards, using a multiphase equilibrium package called MULTIFLASH? from \n\nInfochem software, it is possible to detect the expected CO2-oil mixture density variation as CO2 \n\ndissolves according to different concentrations (see Figure 5.22), considering the present oil \n\ncharacteristics (Attachment B). \n\n67 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.22 - Expected oil mixture density %CO2 variation at 293.15 K \n\nFor an exemplary situation at 293.15 K (20oC), if the initial pressure were 6.89 MPa            \n\n(1000 psi) (?oil = 873.5 kg/m3), the final pressure would be at most 3.45 MPa (500 psi) and the \n\namount of CO2 dissolved would correspond to 40% (?mix = 866.0 kg/m3). Under such conditions \n\nrepresenting a best case scenario for detection, the expected CT number variation would be only \n\n7 H.U. \n\nIn reality, the expected pressure variation is much smaller and hence also the level of CT \n\nnumber variation to be measured. From the observed random errors presented in Figure 5.23 and \n\nFigure 5.24, it is possible to conclude under those conditions (oil 5.31 MPa or 770 psi and 6.94 \n\nMPa or 1006 psi at 293.15 K or 20oC) that the level of precision required to perform the analysis \n\nis not attainable. \n\n68 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.23 \u2013 Total error for experiment 1 profile at pi: 5.31MPa \n\n \n\nFigure 5.24 - Total error for experiment 3 profile at pi: 6.94 MPa \n69 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nA feasible alternative to increase the difference in attenuation coefficients (CT number) \n\nbetween fluids (CO2 and oil) above the referred error levels was adding dopant to crude oil. \n\nThree diffusion tests were performed for each dopant concentration (1%, 4% and 10%) with \n\ninitial pressure at the range of 5.31 MPa (770 psi) and 293.15 K (20oC). From the obtained \n\nresults, it is possible to identify that the optimum dopant concentration that allowed a substantial \n\nCT number variation was 4% volume in oil.  \n\nAfterwards, four experiments were performed with doped oil (4% iododecane) at the \n\nfollowing initial pressures: 2.81 MPa, 5.26 MPa, 9.95 MPa and 28.96 MPa (407 psi, 757 psi, \n\n1406 psi and 4185 psi); all at 293.15 K (20oC). \n\nIn Figure 5.25, Figure 5.26 and Figure 5.27, it is possible to observe a certain CT profile \n\ndecrease during diffusion process, though the random error makes the analysis of CT values \n\ndeviation for each profile a challenging task.  \n\n \nFigure 5.25 \u2013 Experiment 8 profiles with doped oil at initial pressure of 2.81 MPa. \n\n \n\n70 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.26 - Experiment 9 profiles with doped oil at initial pressure of 5.26 MPa. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.27 - Experiment 12 profiles with doped oil at initial pressure of 9.95 MPa. \n\n71 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nDuring experiment 13, CO2 was heavier than oil. That is why it is noticed in Figure 5.28, \n\nthat oil is placed in the top of the diffusion cell. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.28 - Experiment 13 profiles with doped oil at initial pressure of 28.96 MPa. \n\nOnce it is possible to perceive CT profile difference during diffusion process, the \n\nforthcoming step is to obtain the density value for each CT number through a calibration curve. \n\nAs mentioned in previous subsection, for materials with atomic numbers that contributes to \n\nboth Compton scattering and photoelectric attenuation of X-rays such as the doped oil, a dual \n\nenergy measurement shall be taken in order to have a correct relationship between CT numbers \n\nand densities. In Coles et al. (1991), it was explained that two series of measurements of material \n\nwith known densities should be performed in two levels of CT-scan energy. The present CT-scan \n\nin use has only 130 kV and 80 kV levels of energy. At this lower energy level of 80 kV and due \n\nto care dose limitations, it was not possible to increase output of the tube (mA.s) in order to \n\nimprove image quality. Thus, at 80 kV level a very poor image quality was attained, making it \n\nimpossible to obtain a relationship between CT number and densities with an acceptable standard \n\ndeviation. \n\n72 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nThis limitation with doped oil in obtaining a calibration curve at lower energy level \n\nhindered all possible attempts to detect a reasonable CT number variation during diffusion \n\nexperiments at the temperature of 293.15 K. The last resort was to perform diffusion test under a \n\nsimilar reservoir conditions. The initial pressure chosen was 10.36 MPa (1500 psi) and \n\ntemperature was 338.15 K (65oC). In such conditions, CO2 was on its supercritical phase. The \n\nnext figure shows CO2-oil mixture density variation according to CO2 dissolution in the mixture \n\nat 338.15 K (65oC) (MULTIFLASH?). \n\n \nFigure 5.29- Expected oil mixture density %CO2 variation at 338.15 K \n\nAs depicted in Figure 5.30, the major difference on the CT number profile happens after the \n\ncell was heated for 24 hours at 338.15 K (65oC), with such oil density decrease happening \n\nbecause of temperature increase. When the diffusion process takes place, a minor difference \n\nbetween the profiles can only be observed near the interface. The random error is still noticeable \n\nas depicted in Figure 5.31. \n\n73 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.30 - Experiment 14 profiles during heating and diffusion process \n\n \n\nFigure 5.31- Total error for experiment 14 profile at Pi: 10.36 MPa. \n\n \n\n74 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5.2.3. Swelling \n\nAs previously stated, the pressure diffusion cell employed in this work was not windowed. \n\nThus to obtain swelling factor, CT scan was used to acquire CO2-oil interface height variation.  \n\nTo measure CO2-oil interface height variation for each experiment, CT profiles are plotted \n\naccordingly to Figure 5.32 where interfaces are highlighted inside a dashed red box.  \n\nThe cell height values depicted in the next figures represent the matrix\u2019s lines. Thus each \n\nline has the length of 0.011719 cm. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.32 \u2013 CT profiles for experiment 1 \n\nAfter zooming in (see Figure 5.33), the interface variation is measured in the dashed \n\nvertical line, and from now on it is possible to measure the difference between the height where \n\nsystem was not pressurized and system with saturation pressure. \n\n75 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.33 \u2013 Interface position variation indicating swelling \n\nThe Simon and Graue (1965) definition of a dimensionless swelling factor is used to \n\ncalculate a value from the experimental data: \n\nSF =  \noil volume at Psat and T\n\noil volume at 1 atm and T\n \n\n5.1 \n\nAccording to the description above, consistent values for SF can be obtained only after \n\nsaturation pressure of each experiment was reached. This was nevertheless not the case for some \n\nexperiments, where equilibrium time was not attained. \n\nIn Table 5.8, SFs are obtained for each experiment.

Thus, once light components have \n\nbeen already removed previously to CO2 pressurization, there was no volume reduction after \n\nCO2 pumping and consequently oil volume immediately started to swell from its height at \n\natmospheric pressure. \n\n77 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nThis light components extraction during CO2 pressurization is observed during three \n\nexperiments (2, 7 and 8), while few scans were taken during CO2 pumping. This phenomenon of \n\nlight component extraction is very quick, occurring just in the beginning of the experiment and \n\nmay not be detectable in all of them. \n\nAs depicted in Figure 5.34, it is possible to see the interface height position slight reduction \n\nduring CO2 pumping due to oil light components extraction. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.34 \u2013 Volume reduction in the beginning of 2.81MPa test, test 8 \n\nOnce initial pressure of the experiment increased, as observed in experiments 8 to 9, SF \n\ncorrespondently increased. In contrast, when CO2 changes from gas to liquid phase, SF decreases \n\nas noticed in experiments 2 to 3 and experiments 11 to 12.  \n\nFor experiments 3 and 12, the interface position during CO2 injection changed when CO2 \n\nstarted changing into liquid phase. As depicted in Figure 5.35, when CO2  injection is still taking \n\nplace, two interfaces can be clearly noticeable at 5.47 MPa, 5.54 MPa and 5.71 MPa (793 psi, \n\n804 psi and 827 psi) profiles, The first interface is between CO2 gas phase and CO2 liquid phase \n\nand the other one is between CO2 liquid phase and oil. After CO2 injection continued until initial \n\n78 \n \n\n\n\n \n\npressure was reached, CO2 became solely liquid and just one interface is seen (6.92 MPa or 1004 \n\npsi profile). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.35 \u2013 Interface position during CO2 injection for test 3 \n\n \n\nAs also noticed in Figure 5.36, in a moment during diffusion process (after 6.46 MPa or \n\n937 psi), the interface height starts reducing until system reaches equilibrium, from 6.17 MPa \n\n(895 psi) until 5.54 MPa (804 psi). This phenomenon is also noticed for experiments 1, 3 and 12. \n\n79 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.36- Interface position during test 3 diffusion process  \n\n \n\n5.3. GC analysis \nAt the end of 10.36 MPa (1500 psi) and 338.15 K (65oC) experiment, a collection device \n\nwas connected to the top entry of the diffusion cell. The fluid was then collected inside a gas \n\nsampling bag (Tedlar?) at room temperature of 293.15 K (20oC) and GC (gas chromatography) \n\nwas performed with this fluid. Figure 5.37 shows the results of the two GC analyses \n\naccomplished: thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame-ionization detectors (FID). \n\n80 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.37- TCD and FID GC analysis from gas sample at the end of test 14 \n\nAs noticed from GC analysis, a very small amount of light oil components is found inside \n\nthe fluid zone where only CO2 were supposed to be placed. Those light oil components \n\nextraction from oil may be caused by the CO2 supercritical extraction. This assumption as well as \n\ncounter diffusion hypothesis need to be further investigated and better quantified in order to \n\ndetermine if diffusion model needs to be adjusted to this new observation.  \n\n81 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n82 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n6. FINAL REMARKS \n\nThe original focus of this work was to identify the diffusion coefficient and swelling factor \n\nfor CO2 in light oils through CT scans. Such method was preferred as the density concentration \n\nprofile could be directly obtained through measurements, instead of indirect calculations using \n\npressure values. Consequently all measurements were accordantly planned, including doping the \n\noil. On the course of the measurements, it was nevertheless observed that random error at both \n\nmeasurements with original and doped oil (respectively at energy levels of 130 kV and 80 kV) \n\nwas far higher than the required precision to detect the expected density reduction as CO2 \n\ndiffused.  \n\nOne possible solution to decrease such random error would be reducing the aluminum cell \n\nwall thickness, though this could directly lead to lower working pressure levels. Another \n\nalternative would be using a CT scan capable of operating with higher energy levels and without \n\nthe observed limitations from the employed medical model.  \n\nDespite the above referred problematic, CT investigation could offer an important insight \n\non CO2 diffusion inside the oil column. Not only could a significant swelling effect could be \n\nmeasured, but also CO2 displacement down to the bottom of the cell was identified. Those two \n\nconditions were not reported in the literature so far, as the diffusion of CO2 in light oil is not yet \n\nwell documented and might be taken into account for further diffusion models boundary \n\nconditions. \n\nIn contrast the swelling effect could be clearly observed and characterized with such a \n\nprecision level that even volume reduction during both CO2 injection and at the end of some tests \n\ncould be identified.  \n\nSimultaneously to the CT approach, the pressure decay technique was also employed, \n\ndirectly leading to the selection of the diffusion model. The choice of the model from Etminan et \n\nal., (2013) was justified by its interface boundary condition that considered both equilibrium and \n\nnon-equilibrium conditions. Nevertheless, this model was valid for some assumptions (Henry\u2019s \n\nlaw, non-volatile oil, neglected swelling, constant gas compressibility factor) that did not partially \n\nmatch the present experimental conditions (higher pressure and light oil). In addition to this, such \n\nmodel was better suited for experimental data obtained after equilibrium pressure was reached \n\n83 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nand then maintained for a while. However, the non-insolation of diffusion cell during tests at \n\n293.15 K (20oC) and near to supercritical conditions generated experimental data that \n\ncompromised model adjustment.  \n\nDespite such limitations, the obtained diffusion coefficients were within the ranges \n\npreviously reported in the literature. Furthermore, another parameter obtained with the model, \n\nnamely the mass transfer coefficient, allowed identifying that there was almost no mass transfer \n\nresistance in the interface for original oil. \n\nFor further studies, the choice of a model that represents more closely the noticed \n\nphenomena will help obtaining more reliable parameters, such as a diffusion model considering a \n\ndiffusion coefficient dependent on concentration. It is also recommended to compare obtained \n\nexperimental swelling factor to existing correlations in such conditions. About CT scan, once \n\nalmost all tests were performed at 293.15 K (20oC), it is highly suggested to perform additional \n\ntests at experimental settings as near as possible to reservoir conditions, namely at higher \n\npressure and temperature, in order to obtain information more suitable for CO2-EOR projects.  \n\n  \n\n84 \n \n\n\n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAljarwan, A.
