The present article investigates the patterns of distribution of insect herbivores species in forest canopies dominated by\nByrsonima sericea and Mabea fistulifera, pioneer tree species, in disturbed and preserved ecotones and within-forest habitats of a\nseasonal semideciduous tropical forest. The study was developed in the State Park of Rio Doce, South-Eastern Brazil. Both studied\nspecies are frequent in the same type of low and open forests. Moreover, M. fistulifera occurs in the disturbed borders (successional\necotones), while B. sericea in the ecotones with natural lakes, very common in this environment. We sampled insects living on 15\nB. sericea and 23 M. fistulifera in the dry and wet seasons of 2001 and 2002.  A total of 670 insect individuals, distributed in 114\nmorphospecies were found on B. sericea (60 spp.) and M. fistulifera (66 spp.), but only 12 (10.5 %) co-occurred. Insect species\nrichness did not vary significantly between host species or habitats, but overall mean value was higher on B. sericea than M.\nfistulifera. Species richness seems to increase with time, regardless of seasonality. Concerning insect species composition, M.\nfistulifera and B. sericea had very distinct insect herbivore fauna, and B. sericea had distinct fauna between the lake ecotone and\ninside the forest. In one hand, recent climatic shif ts may have caused severe ecological changes, which could have resulted in a\nrelatively poor insect herbivore community. In the other hand, long-term evolutionary exposition of those plant genera to herbivores\nshould have resulted in a greatly specialized insect herbivore community.\n\nKey words: Insect herbivore, host plant specialization, habitat fidelity, species distribution in forest canopies.\n\n1Lab. de Ecologia Evolutiva de Insetos de Dossel e Sucess\u00e3o Natural, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Exatas e Biol\u00f3gicas, Universidade Federal de\nOuro Preto, Morro do Cruzeiro, Campus Universit\u00e1rio, 35400-000, Ouro Preto, MG, Brazil,\n2 spribeiro@iceb.ufop.br;  3janapizz@yahoo.com.br; 4ricardoicampos@yahoo.com.br;\n5Lab. de Ecologia e Comportamento Animal, DBG, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biol\u00f3gicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. wasp@icb.ufmg.br\n\nISSN 1517-6770\n\nResumo: Esp\u00e9cies de insetos herb\u00edvoros associados a \u00e1rvores pioneiras: contrastando habitats de dossel dentro de matas e em\necotones. Este artigo investiga padr\u00f5es da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies de insetos herb\u00edvoros em doss\u00e9is de florestas dominados por\nByrsonima sericea e Mabea fistulifera, esp\u00e9cies pioneiras, em habitats de ecotones perturbados e naturais, e em interior de mata, em\numa floresta tropical semidecidual estacional. O estudo foi desenvolvido no Parque Estadual do Rio Doce, sudeste do Brasil. Ambas\nas esp\u00e9cies estudadas s\u00e3o freq\u00fcentes no mesmo tipo de habitat florestal. Al\u00e9m disso, M. fistulifera ocorre em bordas perturbadas\n(ecotone successional), enquanto B. sericea ocorre em ecotones naturais com lagos, comuns na bacia do m\u00e9dio Rio Doce. N\u00f3s\namostramos os insetos de 15 indiv\u00edduos de B. sericea e 23 de M. fistulifera, nas esta\u00e7\u00f5es secas e chuvosas de 2001 e de 2002. Um\ntotal de 670 indiv\u00edduos de insetos, distribu\u00eddos em 114 morfoesp\u00e9cies foi encontrado em B. sericea (60 spp.) e M. fistulifera. (66 spp.),\nmas somente 12 (10.5 %) ocorreram nas duas esp\u00e9cies. A riqueza de esp\u00e9cies de insetos n\u00e3o variou significativamente entre as\nplantas hospedeiras ou os habitats, mas a m\u00e9dia total foi mais elevada para B. sericea que para M. fistulifera. Independentemente de\nsazonalidade, a riqueza de esp\u00e9cies parece aumentar com o tempo. Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 composi\u00e7\u00e3o da esp\u00e9cies de insetos, a M. fistulifera\ne B. sericea tiveram uma fauna muito distinta. Al\u00e9m do mais, B. sericea apresentou uma fauna distinta entre o ecot\u00f3ne do lago e o\ninterior da mata. Por um lado, mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas recentes causaram altera\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas importantes que deve ter resultado em\numa comunidade relativamente pobre de insetos herb\u00edvoros. Por outro, a longa exposi\u00e7\u00e3o evolutiva destes herb\u00edvoros aos g\u00eaneros de\nplanta estudados deva ter resultado em uma comunidade extremamente especializada.\n\nPalavras-chave: Insetos herb\u00edvoros, especializa\u00e7\u00e3o em planta hospedeira, fidelidade de habitat, distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies em\ndoss\u00e9is florestais.\n\nZOOCI\u00caNCIAS\n10(3): 237-248, dezembro 2008\n\nRevista Brasileira de\n\nInsect herbivores species associated to pioneer tree species:  contrasting\nwithin forest and ecotone canopy habitats\n\nS\u00e9rvio Pontes Ribeiro1,2, Janaina Pizzatti Soares1,3, Ricardo Ildefonso de Campos1,4,\n&amp; Rog\u00e9rio Parentoni Martins5\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zooci\u00eancias 10 (3):239-250. 2008\n\n240.      RIBEIRO et al.\n\nare habitat components which may affect insect\nspecies distribution. However, the difference between\nhabitat fidelity and host feeding specialization is poorly\nunderstood. Recent articles have shown that tropical\ncanopies may hold a greater number of generalist\ninsect herbivores than ever expected (BASSET, 1992;\nNOVOTNY et al., 2002).\n\nThe interaction between upper canopy and the\natmosphe re  is a very important aspect to be\nconsidered while studying microclimate gradients\nacross foliage layers (BASSET et al., 2003). One\nparticularly approach to this subject could be the\ncanopy at real ecotones between forests and other\nvegetation types. Mature forest borders adjacent to\nartificial or natural herbaceous vegetation tend to be\ncovered with live foliage from the upper crowns\ntowards the branches closer to the ground. This\nbranch pattern tend to create a canopy-type of foliage\nedge. Natural, as well as anthropical ecotones may\naffect insect movement, population dynamics and\ncommunity structuring (CAMPOS et al. 2006a).\n\nResearch on this specific habitat-ecotone subject\nis extremely rare (see FOGGO et al., 2001; RIBEIRO,\n2003). We acknowledge only one study about the\ninsect herbivore species distribution in canopy of\ngallery forests in natural ecotones with cerrado\nvegetation, in the Brazilian savanna (RIBEIRO et al.,\n1998), besides a companion work to the present\narticle, on ant assemblies (CAMPOS et al., 2006b). Most\nforest edges, even natural ones, are dominated by\npioneer tree species. The size of these trees tends to\nbe low, creating a gradual decreasing in the canopy\nheight from inside forest towards the borders. Most\nimportantly, these species invest more in growth than\ndefence, and thus may cause increasing diversity of\nherbivore species, and eventually define a distinct\nspecialist/generalist rates. (COLEY, 1983; COLEY et al.,\n1985). Notwithstanding, forest ecotones are usually\ndominated by fewer tree species. According to\ncurrent theory, trees with pioneer life history may\nfavour generalist insects, but high  abundance of a\nfew tree species can affect the insect species on the\nopposite direction, favouring the population of\nspecialists. Another neglected aspect is whether\nevolutionarily old plant communities would accumulate\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTropical forest canopies were considered for a\nwhile as one of the most important reservoir of species\ndiversity in the planet, especially of insect species (ERWIN,\n1989, 1991; BASSET, 2001). Recent research has\npointed towards a more realistic contribution of\ncanopy habitats to insect diversity (BASSET et al., 2003).\nNevertheless, the canopy physical structure, eco-\nphysiology, biomass, and resources may affect a\nreasonable amount of insect population distribution\n(RIBEIRO &amp; BASSET, 2007). Regardless the expansive\ngrowth of quantitative research on tropical canopies,\neach forest has its own natural history and evolution,\nas well as ecological features which may shape\ndifferently the relative importance of each forest\ncompartments. A few general patterns were already\nexplored, but further research on less studied forest\nor tree life histories are urgently needed.\n\nAmongst inse ct herbivore s, the  groups\nCurculionidae ,  Le pidoptera, Chrysome lidae ,\nThysanoptera and Homoptera are the most speciose\nin the various tropical rainforest canopies studies\n(BASSET, 2001; NOVOTNY et al., 2003), which, in fact,\ndoes not make them any different from any other plant\nvegetation (RIBEIRO, 2003). In broad terms, Coleoptera\nare the richest group in the canopy as in any other\nvegetation type, but family frequencies and their relative\nimportance vary between continents and ecosystems\n(BASSET, 1997; KITCHING et al., 1997; RIBEIRO, 2003).\n\nCano pies are  the  lo cation with hig he st\nphotosynthetic activity in a forest, and so are quite\nsuitable for insect population maintenance (NOVOTNY\net al., 2003).  The variation in young versus mature\nleaves is influential for insect distribution (BASSET,\n1991), as well as levels of leaf sclerophylly, which\nseems to favour gall-forming species in the upper\ncanopy and free-feeding chewers in the understorey\n(RI BEIR O &amp; BA SSE T, 2007). In addition,  habitat\nconditions ought to be also important (BERNAYS &amp;\nFUNK, 1999; RIBEIRO et al., 2005). For instance, nutrient\nand chemical composition of foliage, free enemy\nspaces (LAWTON &amp; PRICE, 1979; LAWTON, 1986; BERNAYS\n&amp; MINKENBERG, 1997; RIBEIRO &amp; BASSET, 2007) or tree\narchitectural traits (RIBA, 1998; RIBEIRO et al., 2003)\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zooci\u00eancias 10 (3):239-250. 2008\n\nHerbivores in forest canopies and ecotones     .241\n\na greater rate of specialist herbivore species than a\nmore dynamic wet tropical forest (RIBEIRO, 2003;\nRIBEIRO &amp; BASSET, 2007).\n\nSemideciduous tropical rainforests of South-\nEastern Brazil (in the  domain of the  Atlantic\nRainforest) survive in a highly fragmented landscape,\nwith nearly 95 % of its original area lost. Therefore,\nremaining forest canopies are a mixed of persistent\nand su cce ssional  tre e  speci e s. A spec ie s of\nEuphorbiaceae, Mabea fistulifera Mart., dominates\nmany forest borders in this ecosystem, hereafter\ncalled successional ecotones. This is also a species\nfrequent in natural low forests, normally related to\nsandy and well drained soils.\n\nBesides artificial border, some river basins and\ndrainages are complex and eventually rich in lakes and\nother natural forest-water edges. One particularly well\nstudied system is the Mid-Doce River basin, Minas\nGerais State, which composes one of the largest lake\nsystems of South America. Hence, the natural ecotones\nbetween the forest and lakes provide ideal comparative\nborders to study effect of canopy dynamics near\ntransitional areas. In some lakes, the dominant tree\nspecies is a Malphigiaceae species, Byrsonima sericea\nDC., frequent in low forest with wet soils. This species\nis also common in gallery forests of savanna vegetation.\n\nThis present article aims to compare the effects\nof habitat structure (ecotone versus forest canopy)\non the inse ct he rbivore species richness and\nabundance distribution between B. sericea and M.\nf istulifera, in dif ferent seasons and years. The\nfollowing hypotheses and predictions are addressed:\n\n1. There are differences in the insect herbivore\nspecies richness and  abundance per tree crowns\ncompared between host species and habitats. It is\npredicted that A) ecotone habitats will have less insect\nspecies richness per crown than forest interior, due to\na simpler canopy structure, defined by a small number\nof tree species. Conversely, if B) specialist insect species\nprevail in this community, the number of insect species\nbetween host species is not expected to change\nsignificantly, although densities per crown may change\naccordingly to population dynamics of dominant insects.\n\n2. The re  are dif fe rence s in inse ct specie s\ncomposition between host species, habitats, and along\n\ntime. It is expected a greater variation on insect species\ncomposition along time in the ecotones compared to\ninterior forest, due to ecological unpredictability or\ninconstancy in the former habitat. Moreover, specialist\nspecies will predominate in the ecotones in response\nto the great host plant abundance.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nStudy area\nThe study was developed within the State Park of\n\nRio Doce, in the middle basin of Doce river, South\nEastern Brazil (19o 48\u2019 18\" \u2013 19o 29\u2019 24\" S; 42o 38\u201930\"\n\u2013 42o 28\u2019 18\" W (Fig. 1). This is the largest preserved\nremain of rainforest in the State of Minas Gerais\n(36.000 ha). This Park has an altitude of between\n230m a 515m above sea level (SOCT, 1981), and is\nunder the influence of a mesothermic wet tropical\nclimate (ANTUNES, 1986) with clear wet (October \u2013\nMarch) and dry seasons (April \u2013 September) well\ndefined (GILHUIS, 1986). The Park is covered with a\nvery heterogeneous semidecidual seasonal rainforest\n(LOPES, 1998; VELOSO et al., 1991).\n\nChosen sampling sites are the \u201cTrilha do Gamb\u00e1\u201d\n\u2013 TG \u2013 low forest (average 10 m tall trees) with a\nmix of persistent and pioneer tree species, but well\npreserved and well structure canopy (with both\nstudied species inside the forest); the \u201cOrla da Lagoa\ndo Bispo D.

Byrsonima sericea (\u201cmurici\u201d)\nreaches 10 to 20m and is a heliophyla species,\ncapable to survive in mature forests in dense stands.\nIt has a large geographic distribution, occurring from\nforests and gallery forests in the South-Eastern to\nsemi-arid white forest in North-Eastern Brazil\n(LORENZI, 1992). In the study area, B. sericea is\ncommonly found in the lakes ashore (up to 5-8 m\ntall trees) and in lowland grounds, near temporary\nwater creeks and channels (up to 20 m trees).\n\nMabea fistulifera is a semi-decidual early pioneer\nspecies, heliophyla species, which can reach up to\n20 m tall (LORENZI, 1992). It is found in open low\nforest or in disturbed forests (10-20m tall) or in the\nartificial ecotones between forests and pastures and\nother cultivations (4-8m tall). It is a fast growing\nspecies, with remarkable regenerative capability, and\nvery simple crown architecture. This species can\neasily grow back a whole crown from a lateral\nmeristem (S.P. Ribeiro, pers. Comm.).\n\nInsect Sampling Design\nInsect herbivores were sampled on the crowns\n\nof B. sericea and M. fistulifera, using a beating devise,\nmodified such as RIBEIRO et al. (2005). A random\nbranch (amongst those physically accessible in the\ncrown \u2013 see below) received 10 beats with a hard\nstick above the collecting device. Insects collected\nwere pushed into a central orifice and kept in a plastic\nbag attached to this orifice. After, they were identified\ninto family and sub-family level in the laboratory, and\nthen the most abundant and frequent morphospecies\nwere sent for identification by experts. In the present\npaper, we focused on Coleoptera high taxonomic\nresolution, and analysed feeding guilds in general,\nbased on morphospecies. To access the tree crowns\n\na 4 m tall ladder was used in the ecotone.  In the\nforest, where the canopy was higher, single rope\nclim bing te chnique s and safe  fr e e -clim bing\ntechniques were used to access tree crowns.\n\nBeating samples were taken in the wet seasons\nof 2001 and 2002 (February), and in the dry seasons\nof 2001 and 2002 (September). However,  for\nlogistical problems, in the dry season of 2001 only\nthe ecotone trees were sampled, and thus this\nsampling period was used only to investigate species\ncomposition variation, and not for statistical\ncomparisons. The trees in the ecotones were\nsampled in low and high branches to explore\nstratification patterns (averaged for present analysis).\n\nA total of 15 B. sericea in the ecotone and eight in\nthe forest were sampled in the whole project, and 23\nM. fistulifera in the border and eight in the forest,\nsumming up 54 trees and 278 beating samples, as in\nthree sampling periods. The number of populations\nstudied and trees marked in each population scaled\nup along the sampling periods. Ten trees of each\nspecies in their respective ecotone habitats and six of\neach within the forest are the initial numbers sampled\nfrom the beginning of the project. Hence, this sub-set\nof 32 trees was used to study patterns of species\nrichness and abundance in repeated measure ANOVA\nmodels (see below). The whole beating sample was\nused to study insect species composition, patterns of\nspecies distributions and fauna similarity among the\npopulations and habitats, using multivariate analyses\n(see below). The sample size difference between\necotones and forest reflects the actual tree species\ndensities in these habitats.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe effect of habitat (ecotone vs. forest) and host\n\nplant (B. sericea vs. M. fistulifera) on the insect\nspecies distribution were tested across distinct\nsampling period (wet season of 2001, wet and dry\nseason of 2002). This model was evaluated thought\na Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), where\ntree species and habitat were tested as fixed factors,\nand sample periods were evaluated as multiple\ndependent variables for the number of insect richness\nor abundance - in different models \u2013 for the same\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zooci\u00eancias 10 (3):239-250. 2008\n\nHerbivores in forest canopies and ecotones     .243\n\nG\n\n32 marked trees. MANOVA is adequate for analysing\ntime repeated data because it does not require the\ndependent variables to be equally correlated as\nrepeated-measures. Such unstructured variance-\ncovariance matrix is then the  best choice  to\ninve stigate  re spon se  of i nse ct r ichne ss  and\nabundance variation to habitat and host plant, over\ntime of sampling, nevertheless also allowing the study\nof seasonality effect (VON ENDE, 2001).\n\nIn parallel, ANOVA with repeated measures were\nproduced to test levels of significance related to\ninteractions betwe en host plant,  habitat, and\nsampling period. Univariate repeated analysis\nconcomitantly with a MANOVA approach, were the\nbest choice in exploring more than two repeated\nmeasures, as MANOVA looses power proportionally\nto the number of dependent variable analysed (VON\nENDE, 2001). Hence, for these analyses 96 beating\nsamples were processed. To create a balanced design\nwhich could allow the investigation of interaction\nbetween host plant and habitats, the ecotone habitats\nwere joined together in comparison to the forest\nhabitat. ANOVA with Repeated Measures were\nperformed as far as the data matrix did not depart\nsignificantly from sphericity, in which case an epsilon\nadjustment was applied (VON ENDE, 2001), using\nprocedure in GLM Repeated Measures procedure\nof SPSS 11.5 software. ANOVA models were used\nwith Sum of Squares Type III of this software, which\ndeals better with unbalanced replicates. It is important\nto stress that comparison among mean number of\nspecies and individuals per crown, and between\ncrowns and populations, are aimed in this analyses\n(tested of hypothesis 1). Therefore, ecological\nimplications on the number of species and individuals\nsustained on an individual crown, in a certain plant\ncommunity, are explored instead of estimations of\nGamma Diversity.\n\nDiscriminant analysis was used to investigate\ninsect species distribution between host species and\nhabitats. SPSS for windows 11.5 was used to perform\nall parametric models cited above. Variation in species\ncomposition among seasons and sampling periods\nwas described with a UPGMA cluster analysis,\ndeveloped with the Community Analysis Package 2.1\n\n(Pisces Conservation ltd, 2002). For multivariate\nanalysis on insect community, a less balanced\nsampling effort was used, in order to explore total\nsampling size developed in this project. Hence, data\ncollected in the wet and dry seasons of 2001 and\n2002, from 22 trees of B. sericea and 31 of M.\nfistulifera, were analysed.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSpecies richness and abundance distribution\nA total of 670 insects sorted in 114 herbivore\n\nmorphospecies was found on B. sericea (60 spp.)\nand M. fistulifera (66 spp.) crowns, being that only\n12 morphospecies (10.5 %) co-occurred in both\nspecies. From a total of 31 insect herbivore families,\nCurculionidae (24 spp.), Chrysomelidae (19 spp.),\nAnob iidae  ( 2 spp.) ,  Cicad e llidad e  (5 sp p.),\nBuprestidae (3 spp.) and Membracidae (2 spp.) were\nthe most abundant. Nevertheless, only few species\nreached high  abundance numbers. Among the most\nabundant Coleoptera genera (Fig. 2) we found\nMycrozurus sp (Curculionidae), one species of\nSyphraea sp (Chrysomelidae), Parasypharea sp\n(Chrysomelidae), Colaspis sp (Chrysomelidae), and\nTricorynus sp (Anobiidae). The greatest abundance\nof Mycrozurus sp was found only on B. sericea\ncrowns, and mainly in the ecotone.\n\nThe subset data of 32 marked trees, studied along\nthree sampling seasons for species richness and\n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n0_\n1\n\n2_\n5\n\n6_\n10\n\n11\n_2\n\n0\n\n21\n_3\n\n0\n\n31\n_ 4\n\n0\n\n41\n_5\n\n0\n\n51\n_6\n\n0\n\n61\n_7\n\n0\n\n71\n_8\n\n0\n\n81\n_9\n\n0\n\n91\n_1\n\n00\n\n10\n1_\n\n11\n0\n\n11\n1_\n\n12\n0\n\n12\n1_\n\n13\n0\n\n13\n1_\n\n14\n0\n\n1 4\n1_\n\n15\n0\n\n16\n1_\n\n17\n0\n\nDe nsity class\n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ner\n o\n\nf s\npe\n\nci\nes Parasyphraea sp\n\nColaspis  sp\n\nMycrozurus  sp\n\nTricorynus  sp\n\nAlt icinae sp7\n\nCicadellidae sp 13\n\nFigure 2.

Herbivore species richness did not\nvaried significantly between host species and habitats,\nwithin any sampling period (MANOVA, Tab.1, Fig.\n3). On the other hand, the average number of insect\nspecies across sampling period, showed a higher\nnumber of species on B. sericea than M. fistulifera\n(2.05 \u00b1 0.17 vs 1.56 \u00b1 0.17, between-subjects effects,\nrepeated measures ANOVA, F\n\n1,28 \n= 4.05, P &lt;0.05).\n\nMoreover within-subjects linear contrasts (deviation\ncontrasts, generated by GLM in SPSS) showed a\ntrend towards species richness increasing with time,\nregardless of seasonality (F\n\n1,28\n = 4.46, P &lt;0.045).\n\nThe insect abundance responded significantly to the\ninteraction term between host plant and habitat, but\nonly in the wet season of 2001 (Tab.2).

A noticeable\nseparation between the fauna on B. sericea and on\nM. fistulifera was observed, but further separation\nwas found also within B. sericea located in different\nhabi tats. I n a Dis criminan t analy sis usi ng a\ncombination of plant species and habitats as\ncentroids, the Function 1 (Eigenvalue = 2.46)\nexplained 50.3% of data variation (?2\n\n264\n = 338.6; P&lt;\n\n0.001, Tab.3). Although Function 2 (Eigenvalue =\n1.82) did not distinguish significantly the centroids\n(?2\n\n174\n = 185.9; P > 0.255), it explained 37.5% of data\n\nvariation (Tab.3). The inse ct herbivore  fauna\ncomposition founded on B. sericea population in the\nlake ecotone was distinct from any other host\npopulation, and showed a strong positive correlation\nwith Function 1. The presence of high numbers of\nMycrozurus sp, Parasyphraea sp and Colaspis sp\ndef ined the main canonical coefficients behind\nFunction 1 (Tab.3, Fig. 5), besides Naupactus sp\n(Curculionidae) and Chlamisus sp (Chrysomelidae),\nwhich were also relatively more abundant and\nfrequent in the lake ecotone. Similarly, B. sericea\nfauna in the forest was also positively correlated to\n\nFunction 1 as well as Function 2. As a consequence,\nit was further separated from B. sericea trees in the\necotone. However, it is worthwhile noticing that a\nunique high frequency of Parasyphraea spp. was the\nimportant pattern characterizing this host population.\nTherefore, the habitats composed by B. sericea\ncrowns in the forest or in the ecotone supported\nnearly the same herbivore species, although with\ncompletely distinct species relative densities.\n\n \n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFeb/ 2001 Feb/2002 Sep/2002\n\nMonth of sa mple\n\nM\nea\n\nn \nn\n\num\nb\n\ner\n o\n\nf i\nnd\n\niv\nid\n\nua\nls\n\n o\nf \n\nh\ner\n\nbi\nvo\n\nre\ns \n\nin\nse\n\nct\ns\n\nB. sericea\nM. f ist ulifera\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFeb/2001 Feb/2002 Sep/2002\n\nMonth of sam ple\n\nM\nea\n\nn \nnu\n\nm\nb\n\ner\n o\n\nf \nin\n\ndi\nvi\n\ndu\nal\n\ns \nof\n\n \nhe\n\nrb\niv\n\no\nre\n\ns \nin\n\nse\nct\n\ns\n\nForest\nEcotone\n\nTable 3.

RIBEIRO et al.\n\nMabea fistulifera insect fauna showed strong\nnegative correlation with Function 1 for both forest\nand ecotone populations, but did not distinguish\namongst themselves. The clear separation of B.\nsericea and M. fistulifera was due to the absence of\ncomm on spec ie s,  alo ng with  re mark able\nparticularities, such as the relatively high abundance\nand frequency of one species of Syphraea sp and an\nunidentified species of Cicadellidae, both exclusive\nin the latter host species (Tab.3, Fig.5).\n\nThe present sampling design was not able to detect\nany clear trend in species shifting along time or seasons,\nfor none of host tree species. In general, wet season\nsamples showed dissimilarity index lower than 20%\nbetween hosts and habitats, while dry season samples\ndiffer more than 35 % from the remaining samples,\nexcept for ecotone population of M. fistulifera in 2001,\nand within-forest population of B. sericea in 2002,\nboth very much similar to all wet season samples.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOther studies developed in this forest showed\nsimilar results to ours, i.e., a remarkably small average\nnumber of species and individuals per sample, clearly\nlower than usually found in other tropical forest\ncanopy. NEVES (2006) and SOARES (2006) found in\nan canopy sample of 73 tree species in the Rio Doce\n\nPark equivalent figures to ours, as well as in a study\non an emergent tree species, the Anadenanthera\nmacrocarpa, authors also encountered few insect\nspecies and individuals (CAMPO S et al., 2006b).\nTherefore, any result obtained in this forest contrast\nwith other biomes sampled by the very same method\nin the tropics (BASSET et al., 2001; \u00d8DEGAARD, 2000).\nSOARES (2006) has proposed that Rio Doce forest\nmay support a particularly insect species-poor\ncommunity due  to its e cological young age .\nGeological studies suggest the whole region was\nbroadly covered by xeric ecosystems and more\nopened vegetation no later than 4,000 years ago.\n\nNevertheless, the composition and relative\nimportance of insect herbivore families were very\nmuch as found in most tropical ecosystems. The\ndominant herbivorous families were Curculionidae,\nChrysomelidae and Anobiidae, independently of\nhabitat or host plant. For instance, BASSET et al.\n(2001) found in Gabon (using beating and other\nsampling me thods) that tre e  can opies we re\ndominated by Chrysomelidae and Curculionidade.\nMany other works in tropical canopies all over the\nworld (e.g. BASSET &amp; SAMUELSON, 1996; HAMMOND et\nal., 1996), with several sampling methods, agree that\nChrysomelidae and Curculionidae are the most\nabundant and speciose families. RIBEIRO (2003)\nemphasises that insect family relative densities and\ndiversity in tropical rainforest or savanna canopies\ndo not differ dramatically from those found in any\nother environment. Such review suggests a strong\nevolutionary and phylogenetic constraint behind\ninsect community composition, to which the present\ndata corroborate.\n\nSpecies richness did not vary between host\nspecies or habitats within each sampling period.\nHowever, overall results suggest a greater mean\ninsect species number per crowns of B. sericea than\nM. fistulifera. The same trend was not observed in\nthe cumulative number of herbivore species on each\nhost species, which were similar among the hosts.\nIn part, this pattern resulted from the low average\nnumber of species per host tree individual.\n\nThe mean insect species numbers found on M.\nfistulifera or B. sericea was greater than that found\n\nFi gur e 5.

The seasonal semidecidous forest\nof Minas Gerais State has many common tree\nspecies with the cerrado, and thus an entangled\necologic and evolutionary history with that biome,\nthough poorly understood. Still, the higher humidity\nor better soil conditions could result in a greater alpha\ndiversity of insect herbivores per tree individuals when\ncompared to cerrado host trees. A similar pattern\nwas found in comparing the total cumulative number\nof insect herbivore species per tree, which varied\nbetween 185 to 320 in tropical rainforest habitats\nand 16 to 137 in cerrado tree species (Ribeiro 2003),\nand 114 in the present study.\n\nThe number of insect herbivore species associated\nto a host plant depends on its geographic distribution\nand local  abundance (NEUVONEN &amp; NIEMEL\u00c4, 1981;\nLAWTON, 1982; LEATHER, 1986; MARQUIS, 1991), as well\nas chemical and nutritional leaf contents (CONNOR et\nal., 1980; STRONG et al., 1984). Mabea fistulifera is a\nlatex species, which is a well known appetite inhibitor,\nmainly for chewers (FARRELL et al., 1991). On the other\nhand, Byrsonima is a cerrado genus, and when found\nin the Atlantic rainforest domain, as in the present\nstudy, the species occur in low canopy forests,\nnormally in sandy and less nutrient rich soils.\nThe re fore ,  Byrso nima spe cie s te nd to have\nsclerophyllous leaves, which are clearly less palatable\nto free-feeding herbivores (DINIZ &amp; MORAIS, 1997).\n\nLatex in M. fistulifera and sclerophylly in B. sericea\nmay prevent colonization and survivorship of\nherbivores, particularly generalists. A noticeable\ncontrast with recent findings in insect herbivore\ncommunities in tropical forest, is the fact that this\ntree species are supporting an apparently specialist\nherbivore guild. At least the dominant species found\non these plants are exclusive species, and typically\nassociated to the same plant species all year long,\nover the last four years (S.P. Ribeiro, pers. comm.).\nNOVOTNY et al. (2002) found more than 40 % of\ngeneralist insect herbivore on many tree species in\nPapua New Guinean tropical forest. We only had\n10.5 % of insect species overlap, even though these\ntree species were co-occurring in the same forest.\nMycrozurus sp. was clearly one of these specialist\n\nand dominant species found only on B. sericea, being\na strong determinant of the canopy community\nstructure, namely in the lake ashore.\n\nEach tree species crown traits may create distinct\nmicrohabitat conditions that could influence insect\nspecies fidelity, based on ecological aspects, such as\nmicroclimatic constancy, predator and parasitoid free\nspaces zones (BASSET, 1992; BARNAYS &amp; MINKENBERG,\n1997; RIBEIRO et al., 2005). On the contrary of B. sericea\nfauna, that seems to be specialist but also partially\nexclusive to one or another habitat (such as the\nMycrozurus sp.), the insect fauna found in M.\nfistulifera follows the host species whatever habitat\noccupied. In the present study a majority of the species\nwere found in this plant across the distance of 13 Km\nbetween the studied populations. Therefore, habitat\ndifferences between ecotones and within forest\ncanopies may result in the different insect herbivore\nspecies composition found between B. sericea\npopulations, while M. fistulifera herbivore species\nseems to have closer identity to that host tree species.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nOur results corroborates other recent publications\non canopy habitats and herbivore species distribution\n(RIBEIRO et al., 2005; RIBEIRO &amp; BASSET, 2007), which\nhave challenged the classical concept of pioneer host\nspecies been predominantly occupied by generalist\ninsect herbivores (COLEY et al., 1985).\n\nThe present work corroborates the perception that\nsurrounding habitats is an important aspect to be taken\nin consideration in studies of insect-plant interaction.\nIn addition, our findings also reassure previous\nconclusions as pointed by RIBEIRO (2003) and RIBEIRO\n&amp; BASSET (2007). Evolutionarily old plant community,\nspecially if adapted to extreme conditions, as those\nfound in xeric or sclerophyllous ecosystems of Brazil\n(as antique as the Tertiary ages), may accumulate a\ngreater proportion of specialist insect species than\nfound in equatorial, nutrient rich wet forests.\n\nAs pointed by DRAKE (1990), historical information\nmay clarify patterns unlikely to be described by\ncontemporary ecological processes. Our work\nsuggest that recent climatic shifts may have resulted\n\n\n\nRevista Brasileira de Zooci\u00eancias 10 (3):239-250. 2008\n\n248.
