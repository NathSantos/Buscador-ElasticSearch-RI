The use of remote sensing is a valuable method for geological mapping as it provides synoptic coverage at relatively low cost. In the Amazon region, radar\nimagery has a potential for geological applications due the enhanced sensitivity to topography (macrotopography), surface roughness (microtopography), and dielectric\n\nproperties of materials, independent of weather, sun angle, and illumination conditions. As the roughness is highlighted, SAR textural attributes can be used for mapping\n\niron-ore mineralized laterites in N1 deposit, located in the Caraja?s Province. For mapping the lateritic cover, the airborne SAR was used from Surveillance of the Amazon\n\nSystem (SIVAM/SIPAM, L-hh, L-hv, L-vv) to simulate orbital Multi-Application Purpose SAR (MAPSAR). The images were analyzed through textural classifications\n\nderived from second-order measure (GLCM) with the objective of mapping the mineralized laterites for iron ore. Differences are highlighted when comparing the\n\nclassified maps and the ground information. Not all classes were separated, but a high performance for textural attributes was presented by the hematite class. This class\n\nwas sensitive to the sensor and target parameters, especially macrotopography and physics characteristics. The results showed that for mineral exploration, the radar\n\nimages at L-band can be used as a practical tool for a preliminary mapping, and as a guide for field-based verification.\n\nKeywords: Amazo?nia, SAR, MAPSAR, textural attribute, laterite cover, SIVAM/SIPAM, L-hh, L-hv, L-vv.\n\nRESUMO.

It is one of most important mine-\nral provinces in the world, with a predominating iron produc-\ntion and enormous potentials for Mn, Cu, Au, Ni, U, Ag, Pd, Pt,\nOs, and others (Lobato et al., 2005). This mineral province area\nis on a mountainous terrain with altitudes higher than 900 m,\nsurrounded by southern and northern lowlands with altitudes\naround 150-200 m with thick oxisols (\u201clatosols\u201d) as a result of\ndeep chemical weathering and with few rocks outcrops. The vege-\ntation cover is typical of the Equatorial forest with complex, mul-\ntilevel canopies and numerous species (Paradella et al., 1994).\n\nSince 1967, when the iron deposits were discovered, a re-\nmarkable geobotanical contrast given by the iron-mineralized\nlaterites and specific vegetation types has been recognized. The\ndeposits are related to a set of plateaux covered by thick hard\niron-rich crusts developed over volcanic rocks and ironstones.\nA specific low-density campos rupestres vegetation (Silva et al.,\n1986) is associated with the deposits, and shows a strong con-\ntrast with the dense equatorial forest. This contrast was detectable\nthrough radar airborne C-band imageries during the SAREX\u201992\n(South American Radar Experiment\u201992) campaigns (Morais et al.,\n2002). The province was almost completely covered during the\nSAREX\u201992 campaign in preparation for ERS-2 and RADARSAT-\n1 launches. Details of the SAREX\u201992 can be found in Wooding\net al. (1993).\n\nIn the Amazon region, C-band backscatter intensity is stron-\ngly controlled by decameter scale changes in the surface slope,\nand by centimeter scale roughness characteristics of the crown\nscattering, including multiple scattering within the crowns. The\npreliminary evaluation, by textural classifications, of this SAR data\nhas shown that the backscattered C-band responses are sensitive\nto this geobotanical contrast in depicting variations in the duri-\ncrust vegetation associations (Morais et al., 2002).\n\nDue to the economic importance of this area, there is a\npractical need to provide accurate and up-to-date surface maps\nto support mineral exploration and environmental programs.\nThe province has been extensively covered by various airborne\n(RADAMBRASIL, INTERA, SAREX) and spaceborne SAR (ERS-1,\nJERS-1, RADARSAT-1) surveys. These data have played an im-\nportant role in the acquisition of geological information in the\nCaraja?s Province (Paradella et al., 1997, 2000). In addition,\nwith SAR system satellites (ALOS/PALSAR and RADARSAT-2)\nhaving new characteristics (resolution, polarization, incidence,\nwavelength) the practical utility of textural SAR classification for\nmapping remains to be demonstrated.\n\nThe Brazilian-German MAPSAR (Multi-Application Purpose\nSAR) is a proposal for an innovative L-band sensor whose main\nmission is to assess and monitor natural resources. The MAP-\nSAR mission is a small spaceborne SAR conceived by Brazilian-\nGerman scientific and technical cooperation between INPE\n(Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais ) and DLR (Deutschen\nZentrums fu?r Luft- und Raumfahrt ) (Schro?der et al., 2005). Even\nbefore its lauching, imagery simulation was an important aspect\nfor the potential-use investigation of SAR. Thus, before its laun-\nching, the simulation of MAPSAR imagery is now performed by\nusing images provided by the airborne SAR L-Band sensor, the\nR99 of the SIVAM/SIPAM (Surveillance of the Amazon System)\n(Schro?der et al., 2005). In this stage, a set of test sites was se-\nlected covering fields like Agriculture, Forestry, Geology and Mi-\nneral Exploration, Disaster Management, Coastal Zone Studies,\nGeomorphology, Hydrology and Environmental Analysis.\n\nThe images of the Caraja?s Mineral Province were acquired on\nJune 2005 as part of this campaign. The area was covered in June\n2005 by an airborne SAR-R99B with adapted processing and si-\nmulation techniques to simulate the expected MAPSAR imagery\nproducts. Since the lateritic compositions play an important role\nin the expression of the macro and micro topographical rough-\nness, it was considered worthwhile to evaluate the SAR texture\nobtained from MAPSAR L-band on lateritic crust.\n\nThe main objective was mapping iron ore laterites from the N1\nDeposit in Caraja?s Mineral Province through MAPSAR imagery\nsimulation. The research used the L-band with the expectation\nthat this proposed approach could be used as a tool for mapping\nother similar areas.\n\nSTUDY AREA\n\nThe N1 is an iron-ore deposit located in the Caraja?s Mineral Pro-\nvince, on the easternmost border of the Amazon region (Fig. 1).\nThe total ore resources for the Caraja?s Province are estimated to\nbe 17.8 billion tons having a 66.1% iron concentration (Beisiegel\net al., 1973). The N1 deposit is a plateau with altitudes of around\n700 m and an approximate area of 24 km2.\n\nThe N1 deposit is related to rocks of the Gra?o Para? Group,\ndisplaying complex patterns of folding and faulting. The Gra?o\nPara? Group has been subdivided into two units: volcanic rocks of\nthe Parauapebas Formation (Meirelles et al., 1984), and the iron-\nstones of the Caraja?s Formation (Beisiegel et al., 1973). The vol-\ncanic rocks are a bimodal sequence of basalts, dolerites and\nrhyolites. The ironstones of the Caraja?s Formation are compo-\nsed of several types of iron ore of various oxide facies. They\nare mainly jaspilite and interlayered hematite and silica (Tolbert\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geof??sica, Vol. 29(1), 2011\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/25 \u2014 18:14 \u2014 page 101 \u2014 #3\n\nMORAIS MC, MARTINS JUNIOR PP &amp; PARADELLA WR 101\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Location map of N1 deposit.\n\net al., 1971), which are either of soft or hard hematite (Lobato\net al., 2005). The jaspilites have variable compositions with\n17.11-43.40% Fe and 35.10-60.84% SiO2 presenting typical\ninterlayering of dark and light centimetre-thick mesobands and\nmicrobanding with iron-oxide layers intercalated with white to\npale or bright red layers composed of crypto to microcrystalline\nSiO2 (jasper and chert) with inclusions of cryptocrystalline hema-\ntite (Tolbert et al., 1971; Beisiegel et al., 1973).\n\nUnder the humid tropical climate of the Amazon region, fer-\nruginous and latosoils are extensively developed in the plateau.\nThese weathered products show varying degrees of alteration that\nare responsible for the differences in composition, hardness and\ntextures. The N1 area was mapped during the economic evalu-\nation of the iron reserves in the province (Resende &amp; Barbosa,\n1972). The following types of ferruginous crusts were identified\nin the area: duricrust (in situ duricrust with limonite blocks), che-\nmical crust (hematite fragments with goethitic pisolites), iron-ore\nduricrust (hematite ore blocks and subordinately specularite, ce-\nmented with hydrous ferric oxides), and hematite (mainly hematite\noutcrops). In addition, a latosoil unit was also mapped in a res-\ntricted area, associated with arboreal vegetation. The surface map\nof the plateau is seen in Figure 2.\n\nSituated on rock outcrops N1 vegetation has a typical aspect\nof the tropical scrubs called campos rupestres (Silva et al., 1986).\n\nIt is predominantly composed of herbs and arboreal plants types\nwith less development of the semi-arboreal type. Semi-arboreal\necosystems are common in restrict lands; others areas have arbo-\nreal species strictly found in latosoil. Gramineae and Legumino-\nsae plant families have a large geographic distribution. A geobo-\ntanical control is evident in N1 ferruginous area showing relations\nbetween vegetation and relief that support the crusts (Silva et al.,\n1986). As seen in Figure 3, on the top of the hills with many rock\noutcrops a layer of soil is very restricted and plant species are of\nshort types. Coming down the hills it is common to see some soil\nand organic matter, which permit the development of plant species\nof higher sizes in fissures over the crusts. On the basis of the hills\nthe flora attains its maximum development with a major growth of\nspecies. Many lakes are covered by a vegetation of the Typha sp.\ntype regionally known as \u201ctaboa\u201d, where outcrops of the crusts are\nexposed during the dry seasons.\n\nDATASET\n\nThe research was based on airborne SAR imagery obtained from\nthe Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM/SIPAM, L-hh, L-hv,\nL-vv) aiming for the simulation of orbital Multi-Application Pur-\npose SAR (MAPSAR) used for the assessment and monitoring of\nnatural resource applications in the Amazon region.

Such matrices of spatial grey\ntone dependence frequencies are symmetric and are a function\n\nof the angular relationship between the neighbouring resolution\ncells as well as a function of the distance between them (Hara-\nlick, 1979). Several statistical parameters can be extracted from\nthe GLCM, which can be used as input data in an automatic clas-\nsification process. Weska et al. (1976), and Welch et al. (1990)\nconsider a class of local properties based on absolute differen-\nces between pairs of grey levels. The Grey Level Difference Vector\n(GLDV) is based on absolute differences between pairs of grey\nlevels i and j at a distance d and at a angle ? .\n\nThe textural analysis based on GLCM is a common technique\nwhich proved to be effective in earlier studies, e.g. Shanmugan et\nal. (1981), Ulaby et al. (1986), Yanasse et al. (1993), Baraldi &amp;\nParmiggiani (1995), and Kurvonen &amp; Hallikainen (1999), but few\nexamples have focused on the geological applications in tropical\nenvironments (Azzibrouck et al., 1997).\n\nThe investigation was based on textural descriptors extrac-\nted from the GLCM and GLDV used as input for an unsupervised\nclassification scheme. Some of these parameters are related to\nspecific first-order statistical concepts, such as contrast and vari-\nance, with clear textural meaning (pixel pair repetition rate, spatial\nfrequencies detection, etc.), while other parameters contain tex-\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geof??sica, Vol. 29(1), 2011\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/25 \u2014 18:14 \u2014 page 103 \u2014 #5\n\nMORAIS MC, MARTINS JUNIOR PP &amp; PARADELLA WR 103\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Vegetation changing \u00d7 relief on N1 plateau.\n\ntural information associated with more than one specific textural\nmeaning (Baraldi &amp; Parmiggiani, 1995).\n\nNo speckle filtering was applied to the images in order to\nkeep the original texture of SAR scenes. Representative samples\nof nine classes were chosen, on the basis of field observations\nand the mapped surface: C1 = Latosoil, C2 = Soil (anthro-\npogenic effects), C3 = Duricrust (chemical), C4 = Duricrust,\nC5 = Iron-ore duricrust (with shadow), C6 = Iron-ore duri-\ncrust, C7 = Hematite (with shadow), C8 = Hematite, and C9\n= Lake. The inclusion of some classes with shadow-effects\nwas necessary since shadow effects were pronounced on the\nSAR images. Based on these samples, second-order measures\nderived from GLCM (mean, homogeneity, contrast, dissimila-\nrity, entropy, energy, correlation) and from Grey-Level Difference\nVector-GLDV (energy, entropy, mean, contrast) were analyzed.\nThe second-order measures were computed with nine configu-\nrations of distance (d ), i.e., (\u20132.0), (\u20132.1), (\u20132.2), (\u20131.2), (0.2),\n\n(1.2), (2.2), (2.1), and (2.0). Since 82 measures were made, it be-\ncame impracticable to use such a large number of configurations\nin the classification.\n\nTherefore, texture measure selection was based on the Dis-\ncriminant Factor decision rule that evaluates the separability be-\ntween classes which details of method can be found in (Renno? et\nal., 1998). Thus, for two hypothetical classes A and B, and one\ntexture measure k, the Discriminant Factor was computed accor-\nding to the variation between and within these classes, given by\nEquation (1):\n\nD FA B,k =\n\nn A ?\nn A?\n\ni =1\n\n(\nX Ai,k ? X B,k\n\n)2\n+ n B ?\n\nn B?\n\ni =1\n\n(\nX Bi,k ? X A,k\n\n)2\n\nn A ?\nn A?\n\ni =1\n\n(\nX Ai,k ? X A,k\n\n)2\n+ n B ?\n\nn B?\n\ni =1\n\n(\nX Bi,k ? X B,k\n\n)2\n(1)\n\nwhere X?i,k is the i\nth sample of class ? for the measure k,\n\nX ?,k is the mean value of measure k class ?, and n? is the\nnumber of samples of class ?.\n\nBrazilian Journal of Geophysics, Vol. 29(1), 2011\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/25 \u2014 18:14 \u2014 page 104 \u2014 #6\n\n104 MAPPING IRON-MINERALIZED LATERITE ENVIRONMENTS\n\nAccording Equation (1), the texture measure chosen to sep-\narate classes A and B is one that selects the highest value of\nD FA B for all k, indicating the best separateness for these clas-\nses. D FA B,k values near one denote that there is confusion\nbetween classes A and B for the texture measure k. Thus, for\neach pair of nine N1 classes, the best set of measures were se-\nlected by the criteria described above, using only high DF, which\ngave (visually) a good performance for classification.\n\nThe next step was to generate selected textural channels\nusing texture analysis. For a better control of the grey levels, the\ntextural channels were processed with 32-bits. A 7\u00d77 window\npixel cell size was selected in order to maintain GLCM sensiti-\nvity to the smallest details of the targets while reducing both noise\neffects. An unsupervised ISODATA classifier (Mather, 1987) was\nused for the classification. The classifications were based on the\nbest sets of texture measures for each polarization isolated (hh, hv,\nand vv) and combined (hh and hv; hh and vv; hv and vv; hh, hv,\nand vv). In order to refine the results, a post-classification Mode\nfilter algorithm was also applied.\n\nThe classification results were analyzed through a confusion\nmatrix to estimate the amount of correctly and incorrectly classi-\nfied pixels for each class. The method used to evaluate its accu-\nracy was the kappa coefficient of agreement (Foody, 1992), which\nwas evaluated through test samples extracted from the Surface-\nCover Map (see Fig. 2). On each classified map, 48 points were\nrandomly allocated for two classes: hematite and no hematite. The\nstatistic test used to evaluate the significant differences between\nthe two classifications is given by Equation (2). All tests for the\nsignificant difference between classification results were carried\nout at a 95% confidence level. At this level, two results may\nbe considered significantly different if 1k? >1.96 (Benson &amp;\nDeGloria, 1985).\n\n1k? =\n\n?\n?k?1 ? k?2\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?? 2?\n\n[\nk?1\n\n]\n+ ?? 2?\n\n[\nk?2\n\n] , (2)\n\nwhere k? kappa and ?? 2?\n[\nk?\n]\n\nis the variance kappa.\nIn the radar images, small-scale surface roughness refers to\n\nmicrorelief that may modulate the radar return in flat terrain. The\nroughness varies with radar wavelengths, incidence angle, and\nthe topography. The roughness may closely relate to underlying\ngeological substrate and may also be caused by weathering pro-\ncesses, by soil composition, or vegetation associations (Werle,\n1988).\n\nThe roughness is a very important target parameter that influ-\nences the performance of the textural classification, and rough-\nness measurements were also collected at 73 representative si-\n\ntes of the main classes. Surface roughness is generally difficult\nto measure accurately in the field, but the in situ measurements\nwere considered a first approximation to categorise lateritic crusts\nas smooth, intermediate, or rough. The height values from each\nunit were obtained, in RMS (root mean square) values, by inser-\nting a thin plate into the surface (Fig. 4) photographing it, and\ndigitising the profile. The roughness classification was based on\nthe criterion proposed by (Peake &amp; Oliver, 1971) calculated for\nlocal incident angles at L-band wavelength.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFor each SAR configuration, Table 2 shows the best selected\ntextural measures used in the classifications with distances d\n(distance in pixels at considered direction for measures related\nto GLCM). The mean and GLDV contrast measures were sensiti-\nve for all data.\n\nTable 2 \u2013 Best selected textural measures with the d dis-\ntances for each SAR configuration used in the classification.\n\nSAR data Measures d\n\nL-hh\n\nMean \u20132.1\n\nDissimilarity 1.2\n\nGLDV contrast 1.2\n\nGLDV energy 2.1\n\nL-hv\n\nMean 1.2\n\nContrast \u20132.1\n\nGLDV contrast 2.2\n\nEntropy \u20132.2\n\nL-vv\n\nMean \u20131.2\n\nEntropy \u20132.0\n\nHomogeneity 1.2\n\nGLDV contrast \u20132.1\n\nThe set of selected measures was used as input for the un-\nsupervised classification with hh, hv, vv \u2013 L bands and their\ncombinations, hh and hv; hh and vv; hv and vv; hh, hv and vv.\nThe best textural classification for L-band is shown in Figure 5\n(hh and vv). The results indicate that not all classes were discrim-\ninated on SAR-R99B images when compared with the Surface-\nCover Map (see Fig. 2). The latosoil, duricrust (chemical), iron\nore duricrust, and lake were not classified. Backscattered L-band\nresponses are no sensitive to these classes. For latosoil the\nvolume scattering effect was predominant, since response was\naffected by forest canopy over the terrain.\n\nL-band is very sensitive to small-scales variations in surface\nroughness and the backscatter is affected by the terrain below\na vegetation canopy (Tapley, 2002). The dielectric properties of\nsurface materials can also influence on radar return signal.

Lateri-\ntic crusts have capability to retain high water volume on the rainy\nseasons, but the area was affected by the strong drought, which\noccurred in the Amazon region, from November 2004 to the end\nof 2005 (Marengo et al., 2008).\n\nThe drought influenced SAR imagery acquisition on June\n2005, corresponding to the low rain mean of that year (Fig. 6).\nAt this condition, duricrust (chemical) showed very dry grass\nvegetation in flat terrains, and the low backscattering can be re-\nlated to low values of dielectric. This effect was also observed in\ndry lakes. At normal rain conditions, it was expected the typical\naquatic vegetation on lakes, and as a consequence a higher radar\nresponses. Therefore, grasses vegetation appears smooth at L-\nband, as showed in Figure 7, and it has affected the classification\nthat may results on confusion where dry lakes were incorrectly\nclassified as soil (anthropogenic effects).\n\nAlthough the soil (anthropogenic effects), duricrust, and he-\nmatite were relatively well classified, they presented confusion\nwith other classes. For this reason, the statistical analysis was\nmade between hematite and no hematite classes. Table 3 shows\nthe kappa values for all classifications, where duricrust and soil\n(anthropogenic effects) were grouped into the \u201cno hematite\u201d class\nand evaluated with \u201chematite\u201d class. According to this table, the\nhh classification was better than vv polarization, while the cross\npolarization presented the worst result.

The cross-polarized caused a de-\ncreased on kappa values when it added on both hh and vv classi-\nfications as it can be derived by a loss of signal radar on cross-\npolarized response. Also, cross-polarized signal provided a\nbetter discrimination between specular and diffuse signal re-\nturn, like classes covered by dry grasses and arboreal and semi-\narboreal vegetation.\n\nIn relation to roughness classification, N1 plateau with a re-\nlative flat topographic relief and low elevations variation (Fig. 9)\nis controlled by microrelief. A small range of incident angles\noccurred since N1 plateau as located in the centre of swath. With\nregards to L-band, the surface roughness of lateritic crusts de-\nrived from 73 in situ measurements based on a scheme propo-\nsed by Peake &amp; Oliver (1971) were not sensitive to the variations\n(Fig. 8). According to these results, most classes were classified\nas intermediate, i.e., the diffuse reflection is observed and this\nresults in medium backscattering SAR. Duricrust (chemical) and\nsoil (anthropogenic effects), presented the best results and were\nclassified as smooth, as expected at L-band. The reduced size\nparticles of these classes, located at flat areas, showed a specular\nreflection at this wavelength.\n\nThe influence of macrotopography was evident on hematite\nresults classification. This class exhibits a stronger influence on\nrelief in eastern segment of the plateaux given by bright returns\nand shadows (front/back slopes). Further, the 282? look azimuth\ndirection favoured the relief enhancing terrain oriented at NW-SE,\nwith many occurrence of hematite.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nTextures attributes derived from second-order measures (GLCM)\nfrom airborne SAR L-band can be used with limitations as a\npractical tool for a preliminary map. The investigation has shown\nthat textural descriptors were sensitive to the (1) SAR wavelength,\n(2) SAR polarization, and (3) target parameters (dielectric cons-\ntant, macro and microtopography). L-band was very sensitive to\nsmall-scale areas of vegetation and the surface backscatter was\naffected by the terrain below this vegetation. For forest canopy\non flat terrain, the volume scattering effect was predominant.\nThe hh polarization has better performance than vv to penetrate\nmaterials with a compact horizontal structure, like hematite. Alre-\nady vv polarization presented better performance on discrimina-\ntion targets with similar roughness characteristics, like vegetation,\nsoil (anthropogenic effects), duricrust (chemical), and dry lakes.\nThe cross-polarized signal caused a decreased on classification\nresults and it can be due to the loss of signal radar on cross-\npolarized response. The dielectric constant can be affected area\nsubmitted targets to drought conditions. The hematite compact\nstructure, on higher areas of the plateau, was sensitive to macro-\ntopography and, and it contributed to discriminate it from others\nclasses. The surface roughness was poorly classified at L-band\nand most classes were classified as intermediate. Most classes\nwere classified as smooth at specular reflection conditions. From\nall these factors, it can be observed that the wavelength was the\nmost important factor to discriminate iron-mineralized laterites in\nN1, as previously observed at C-band in N1. Also, this approach\n\nRevista Brasileira de Geof??sica, Vol. 29(1), 2011\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2011/7/25 \u2014 18:14 \u2014 page 109 \u2014 #11\n\nMORAIS MC, MARTINS JUNIOR PP &amp; PARADELLA WR 109\n\nFigure 9 \u2013 DEM generated from topographic curves \u2013 N1 plateau.\n\ncan be used as a practical tool for a preliminary map, which may\nserve as a guide for detailed iron-mineralized laterites mapping in\nCaraja?s, and other minerals, like phosphate-titanium mineralized\nlaterites in Maicuru.
