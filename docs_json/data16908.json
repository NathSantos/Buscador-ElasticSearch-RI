The tension applied\nto the polymeric matrix will be transferred in part\nto the disperse phase, the filler, since it presents\nproperties superior to the pure polymer [3].\nEfficient reinforcement is achieved by interac-\ntions of the constituents of the biphasic material\n\n[4-5] via mechanisms of adhesion, which could\nbe: adsorption, chemical bonding and mechanical\nadhesion. Chemical bonding is the most efficient\nform of adhesion and occurs with the application\nof coupling agents on the surface of the filler,\nwhich serves as a bridge between the polymer\nand the reinforcement. In mechanical adhesion,\nthe polymer fills in the grooves of the filler; this\nadhesion tends to be low unless there is a large\nnumber of recesses on the surface of the filler [6]. \n\nSeveral types of materials exist that can be\nused as filler.  Among the inorganic materials uti-\nlized as filler, notable ones include: calcium car-\nbonate, aluminum hydroxide, silica, titanium\ndioxide and talc [6]. Some of the organic materi-\nals more commonly used are carbon black [7] and\nnatural fibers [8-9]. \n\nIn flexible polyurethane foams, the fillers\npromote an increase in density and resistance to\ncompression.

However, it is observed that\nthe excess of commercial CaCO3 utilized in industry possibly causing permanent deformations and\ndamaging the quality of the final product. The effect of different concentrations of commercial CaCO3,\nin flexible foams, was studied. Different concentrations of CaCO3 were used for the synthesis of flex-\nible polyurethane foams, which were submitted to morphological and thermal analyses to verify the\nalterations provoked by the progressive introduction of this filler.  \n\nKeywords: polyurethane; flexible foam; calcium carbonate.\n\n\n\nmation. In addition, properties such as tear strength,\nfor example, are significantly affected by the intro-\nduction of filler [10]. Accordingly, it is necessary to\nknow the end-use of the material in order to use the\ncorrect concentration in the polymer matrix, obtain-\ning a product of reliable quality. In spite of the\npolyurethane industry widely using calcium carbon-\nate as a filler, generally the quantity used is defined\nrandomly. In the businesses visited in the region of\nBelo Horizonte in Minas Gerais State - Brazil, no\ndata was available on the influence of this filler on\nthe foam, nor was there any methodology to define\nthe ideal quantity of calcium carbonate that should\nbe added without causing damage to the mechanical\nproperties of the final product. \n\nThus the proposal of the present work was to\nanalyze the morphological, mechanical and thermal\nbehavior when various concentrations of commer-\ncial calcium carbonate were introduced into the\npolymer matrix using scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(EDS) microanalysis and thermal analysis.\n\nExperimental\n\nPreparation of flexible foams\nFor the fabrication of the flexible foams,\n\nthe following components were used: polyether\npolyol Voranol 4730N (100.00 pph = parts per\nhundred parts of polyol) and TDI Voranate T-80\n(50.00 pph) purchased from Dow Chemical; the\nsilicone surfactant PDMS/POE (0.60 pph) from\nGeneral Electric; amine Aricat AA 805 purchased\nfrom Arinos (0.16 pph) and stannous dioctoate II\n(Liocat 29, Miracema-Nuodex, 0.30 pph) were\nused as catalysts in the polymerization and\nexpansion reactions [11-12]; distilled water (3.00\npph); and commercial calcium carbonate (1, 9,\n15, 21 and 30 pph) obtained from the mattress\nmanufacturing industries in the region of Belo\nHorizonte. The stoichiometry of the formulation\nused in industry was adjusted for the lab-scale\nfabrication of foams. The isocyanate index used\nwas 132. A Fisatom model 710 shaft stirring\ndevice (power: 25W, rotation: 25-200 rpm) was\nused for stirring. \n\nPolyol and the filler were placed in a dis-\nposable plastic receptacle, and the mixture was\n\nstirred until complete homogenization. Next, the\namine, surfactant and water were added. The mix-\nture was submitted to mechanical stirring for 60\nseconds.  Shortly after the catalyst was added and\nthe mixture was stirred again for 30 seconds. After\nintroducing the isocyanate, the mixture was sub-\nmitted to 6 seconds of stirring and then poured into\na cubical cardboard box (7cm x 7cm x 7cm). The\nfoams were left to cure for seven days.\n\nFlexible foams analyses\nFor the instrumental analyses, the follow-\n\ning instruments were used: SEM \u2013 Jeol JSM-840;\nmicroanalysis (EDS) \u2013 Jeol-8900 electron probe\nmicroanalyzer; thermogravimetric analysis (TG)\n\u2013 Netzsch STA 409EP.\n\nSEM \u2014 The samples were cut into little\npieces (0.5cmx0.5cmx0.5cm) using scissors.\nNext they were covered with a fine layer of gold\nto permit observation in SEM since the samples\nwere not conductors. The samples were analyzed\nunder magnifications of 50, 150 and 500x. \n\nEDS \u2014 The samples of calcium carbonate\nwere covered with a thin layer of carbon and ana-\nlyzed under with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV\nand a current of 20 nA. \n\nTG \u2014 alumina crucible; dynamic atmos-\nphere of air; 100 mL.min-1 gas flow; heating rate\nof 10\u00baC min-1; heating range of 25-950\u00baC. The\nsample masses were approximately 12 mg. \n\nResults and discussion\n\nMorphological analysis  of commercial calcium\ncarbonate\n\nWhen a filler is introduced into a poly-\nmeric material, the ideal is that it has regular gran-\nulometry and that its particles are sufficiently\nsmall to enable good distribution in the matrix [7].\nFigure 1 presents the image obtained in the scan-\nning electron microscopy (SEM) of commercial\ncalcium carbonate at a magnification of 500x. \n\nIn the image obtained, it was observed that\nthe calcium carbonate presented irregular, hetero-\ngeneous and coarse granulometry. The calcium\ncarbonate, used in the present work, showed a\nlarge polydispersion in granulometric analysis\nwith sieves of defined particle sizes. The particle\n\n56 Ecl. Qu\u00edm., S\u00e3o Paulo, 33(2): 55-60, 2008\n\n\n\nsize varied between 200 and 250 mesh. This filler\nis used in the mattress industry without any pre-\ntreatment because it is a residue generated in the\nfabrication of lime and sold to the manufacturers\nat reduced prices. The calcium carbonate was also\nsubmitted to a qualitative X-ray energy dispersive\nspectrum (EDS, Figure 2), where it was possible\nto detect the various elements of its constitution. It\nis worth noting that to improve the foam quality,\ngranulometry aside, the ideal is to utilize a chemi-\ncally pure material that does not contain sub-\nstances that could react with the matrix, leading to\nthe degradation of the material.\n\n57Ecl.

(a) SEM of flexible foam filled with cal-\ncium carbonate (magnification of 150 and 500x);\n(b) SEM of a transversal section of foam with car-\nbonate (magnification of 1000x).\n\nMorphological analysis  of flexible foams\nFigure 3 presents the image (SEM) of the\n\nflexible foams containing calcium carbonate and\nits transversal section. \n\nIt is observed that the calcium carbonate\nadded is agglomerated in some points in the poly-\nmer matrix and not evenly distributed homoge-\nneously, as is required to promote an efficient rein-\nforcement [5,13]. This result was expected since\nthe filler utilized presented polydispersion in gran-\nulometry. A low interaction of the filler used and\n\nB\n\nA\n\n\n\nthe polymeric matrix was further verified by\nmicroscopy, which probably contributed to the\ndeformations observed further (Figure 4). The use\nof excessive quantities of filler causes enrichment,\nit also is responsible for damage to the matrix [14],\ncausing the foam to lose its characteristic polyhe-\ndral morphology. The arrows show the worsening\nmorphology as higher concentrations are added.\n\nThermal analysis\nAccording to the TG curves, the\n\npolyurethane presents typical decomposition in\ntwo stages between 200 and 600oC, generating a\nfinal residue of 1.73%. The commercial calcium\ncarbonate decomposes between 600 and 800oC,\nlosing CO2 and generating CaO with a final residue\nof ~62.68%. This high value of the residue means\nthat the commercial calcium carbonate, probably,\ncontains inert compounds like CaO, SiO2, Al2O3,\netc, compatible with the EDS analysis.\n\nThe flexible foams containing commer-\ncial calcium carbonate as a filler were also sub-\nmitted to thermal analysis. Figure 5 presents the\nTG curves of the foams with carbonate in vary-\ning concentrations and also the TG curve of the\nfoam without calcium carbonate. \n\nBy means of the residues obtained in the\nTG curves it was verified that the filler is not\nhomogenously distributed throughout the foam\nsince the residue percentage obtained did not cor-\nrespond to the concentration of carbonate added in\nthe sample preparation. This observation agrees\nwith the verifications done in the morphological\nanalysis of foams with calcium carbonate.\nNevertheless a shift in decomposition temperature\nof the flexible foams to lower values was seen\n\n58 Ecl.

SEM of foam filled with carbonate at concentrations of 9, 15 and 21% (magnification of 50x).\n\nwith an increase in calcium carbonate concentra-\ntion. The foams with carbonate present three\nstages of decomposition, two of which are attrib-\nuted to the loss of organic material and the third\nstep is attributed to the decomposition of calcium\ncarbonate. Figures 6a, b and c display a linear\ndependency of the quantity of mass lost in the 1st,\n2nd and 3rd stages of decomposition of the com-\nposites on the concentration of filler (CaCO3).\n\nThe quantities of mass lost in the 1st and 2nd\n\nstages diminished with an increase in the concen-\ntration of CaCO3. As the concentration of filler did\nnot greatly influence the decomposition of\npolyurethane, a directly proportional relation\nbetween the mass lost and the concentration of filler\nwas expected. The analysis of pure polyurethane\nshowed that 97.8% of its mass was lost in the first\ntwo stages of decomposition (Table 1).  \n\nUsing an approximation of the rule of\nmixing and substituting the volumetric fraction\nfor the mass fraction [5, 15-16] yields:\n\nFigure 5.

Since there was no mass loss\nof the filler because these stages occurred at tem-\nperatures below its decomposition temperature,\none can consider this loss to be zero, and using\nequation (1) yields: CP1% = 97.84 x 0.99 = 96.86%\nfor foam with 1% filler.  Substituting the other con-\ncentrations, one obtains the mass losses in these\ntwo stages for the foams with different concentra-\ntions of commercial calcium carbonate (Table 1). \n\nTable 1. % Mass loss as a function of the amount of\nCaCO3 for the 1\n\nst and 2nd stages\n\n% CaCO3 \u2021 Calculated Observed\nmass loss (%) mass loss (%)\n\n0 97.83 97.84\n1 96.86 95.29\n9 89.03 87.65\n15 83.16 82.12\n21 77.29 76.77\n30 68.48 72.39\n\n\u2021The quantity of calcium carbonate is expressed in\ng per 100 parts polyol.\n\nThe values calculated for the mass loss in\nthe first stage of decomposition considered the\nhypothesis of having only weak interactions\nbetween the filler and the matrix, proportional to\nthe mechanical adhesion. On comparing the exper-\nimental and calculated values, it can be observed\nthat the proximity of the experimental values to the\ncalculated ones confirms the initial hypothesis. The\ndecomposition of the filler was the primary event\nin the third stage (Figure 6c). Thus the first term of\nthe equation was considered null. Table 2 presents\nthe calculated and observed mass losses in the third\nstage for all of the flexible foams with varying con-\ncentrations of calcium carbonate.\n\nThe difference generated between the cal-\nculated and observed values in the third stage are\ndue to the dispersion of the filler in the polymer.\nFor performing the calculations with Equation 1,\nthe concentrations of calcium carbonate that\nmust be aggregated in the polymer matrix were\nconsidered. However, as observed previously in\nthe morphological and thermogravimetric analy-\nses, the filler did not disperse well in the matrix\nbut formed agglomerates, which influenced the\nresults obtained in Table 2. \n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThe calcium carbonate did not disperse well\nin the matrix since it has variation in particle size\nand presents interactions that tend to form agglom-\nerates, making it so that there is not a distribution\nof force between the carbonate and the matrix dur-\ning the utilization of the flexible foam. \n\n60 Ecl.
