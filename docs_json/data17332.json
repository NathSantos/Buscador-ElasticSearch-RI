Localizado nas rochas supracrustais, o corpo Ing\u00e1 \u00e9 dividido \n\nem Zona Superior e Zona Inferior. A Zona Superior cont\u00e9m lentes de sulfeto maci\u00e7o \n\nhospedadas em dolomitos. A Zona Inferior foi sistematicamente estudada por DRX, \n\nFRX, ICP-MS, microssonda eletr\u00f4nica e LA-ICP-MS. \u00c9 controlada por uma falha de \n\nempurr\u00e3o de baixo \u00e2ngulo principal (Estrutura III) e suas litologias incluem, do topo \n\npara a base: dolomitos, filito carbonoso (GXN), veio de quartzo massivo (VQZ), \n\nquartzo-clorita-sericita-granada xisto e metagrauvaca com dois raros tipos de dique \n\ncortando a estratigrafia. Halos de altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal desenvolveram-se a partir da \n\nEstrutura III: silicifica\u00e7\u00e3o, pot\u00e1ssico, f\u00edlico e carbon\u00e1tico. A mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o ocorre em \n\ntr\u00eas diferentes est\u00e1gios. Tr\u00eas tipos de arsenopirita foram identificados: Aspy1 (cedo \n\nhidrotermal), Aspy2 (tardi hidrotermal, possivelmente rica em ouro invis\u00edvel) e Aspy3 \n\n(tardi hidrotermal, rica em ouro vis\u00edvel como inclus\u00f5es, preenchendo fraturas ou ao \n\nlongo de suas margens). Ouro vis\u00edvel tamb\u00e9m ocorre como cristais livres nos n\u00edveis \n\nbasais do VQZ e na matriz do GXN. Poss\u00edvel remobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de ouro invis\u00edvel inferido \n\nem Aspy2 para formar ouro vis\u00edvel em Aspy3 ao longo de fraturas tardias e altera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nseletiva em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s margens dos cristais, ocorreu como consequ\u00eancia do \n\ndobramento F2, aumentando a quantidade de ouro pass\u00edvel de extra\u00e7\u00e3o no corpo de \n\nmin\u00e9rio. Os gr\u00e1ficos de Bi ppm x Se ppm e S % x Bi ppm e consider\u00e1veis ganhos de \n\nAs, Ni e Co na zona de silicifica\u00e7\u00e3o sobre GXN rico em arsenopirita, podem ser \n\nusados para identificar zonas potencialmente ricas em ouro. Quatro par\u00e2metros \n\nprospectivos foram estabelecidos: VQZ, Aspy2 e Aspy3, falhas de acomoda\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nzona de silicifica\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Ouro; Crix\u00e1s; Greenstone; Mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o; Arsenopirita. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe Ing\u00e1 orebody was discovered in 2012 and is located in the world-class \n\nAngloGold Ashanti \u2013 Serra Grande Unit of the Crix\u00e1s Gold District, Central Brazil. \n\nLocated in the supracrustal rocks, Ing\u00e1 is divided into Upper and Lower Zones. The \n\nUpper Zone contains massive sulfide lenses hosted in dolomites. The Lower Zone \n\nwas systematically studied by XRD, XRF, ICP-MS, EMP and LA-ICP-MS. It is \n\ncontrolled by a major low angle thrust fault (Structure III) and lithologies include, from \n\ntop to bottom: dolomites, carbonaceous phyllite (GXN), major quartz vein (VQZ), \n\nquartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist, and metagraywacke with two types of rare \n\ncross-cutting dikes. Hydrothermal alteration haloes developed outwards from \n\nStructure III: silicification, potassic, phyllic and carbonatic. Mineralization occurs in \n\nthree different stages. Three types of arsenopyrite were identified: Aspy1 (early \n\nhydrothermal), Aspy2 (late hydrothermal, possibly invisible gold-rich) and Aspy3 \n\n(later hydrothermal, visible gold-rich as inclusions, filling fractures or along its \n\nmargins). Visible gold also occurs as free crystals in the VQZ basal levels and in the \n\nGXN matrix. Possible remobilization of inferred invisible gold in Aspy2 to form visible \n\ngold in Aspy3 along late crystal fractures and selective alteration towards the margins \n\noccurred as consequence of F2 folding, increasing the orebody gold budget. The Bi \n\nppm x Se ppm and S percent x Bi ppm plots and major gains in As, Ni and Co in the \n\narsenopyrite rich GXN silicification zone could be used to identify potentially gold rich \n\nzones. Four prospective parameters were established: VQZ, Aspy2 and Aspy3, \n\naccommodation faults, and silicification zone. \n\n \n\nKeywords:  Gold; Crix\u00e1s; Greenstone; Mineralization; Arsenopyrite.\n\n\n\n7 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSUM\u00c1RIO \n\n \n\n1.

INTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O \n\n \n\nO distrito aur\u00edfero de Crix\u00e1s constitui o quarto maior distrito de ouro atualmente \n\nem produ\u00e7\u00e3o no Brasil. A regi\u00e3o e seu potencial aur\u00edfero, explorada como garimpos \n\ndesde o s\u00e9culo XVIII pelos Bandeirantes, foi consolidada a partir da d\u00e9cada de 1980 \n\ncom o estabelecimento da Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Serra Grande (minera\u00e7\u00e3o subterr\u00e2nea \n\nmecanizada), posteriormente objeto de negocia\u00e7\u00f5es empresariais e atualmente \n\ncontrolada totalmente pela empresa AngloGold Ashanti \u2013 Serra Grande. \n\nNos \u00faltimos anos, programas de explora\u00e7\u00e3o mineral para amplia\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos \n\ne reservas resultaram no descobrimento de novos corpos mineralizados a ouro, \n\ncomo o corpo Ing\u00e1 em 2012. Possuindo 0.59 MOz de ouro a um teor m\u00e9dio de 5.91 \n\ng/t (31/12/2017), o corpo Ing\u00e1 iniciou sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o em 2017. A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ncorpo de min\u00e9rio Ing\u00e1 est\u00e1 vinculada a projeto do grupo de trabalho da Universidade \n\nFederal do Rio Grande do Sul junto a AngloGold Ashanti \u2013 Serra Grande que \n\nobjetiva investir na caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o geol\u00f3gica e da altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal de corpos de \n\nmin\u00e9rio descobertos recentemente no distrito aur\u00edfero de Crix\u00e1s, como o corpo \n\nPalmeiras em 2006 (Almeida, 2006), Pequiz\u00e3o em 2011 (Sobiesiak, 2011) e \n\nMangaba em 2018 (de Souza, em andamento). Al\u00e9m disso, o presente estudo visa \n\ncontribuir no entendimento da g\u00eanese e configura\u00e7\u00e3o do corpo e sua mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\naur\u00edfera, de modo a contribuir para futuras novas descobertas de corpos de min\u00e9rio \n\nno greenstone belt de Crix\u00e1s. \n\n \n\n1.1. SOBRE A ESTRUTURA DA DISSERTA\u00c7\u00c3O \n\n \n\nA presente disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de mestrado est\u00e1 estruturada em torno de artigo submetido a \n\nperi\u00f3dico. Sua organiza\u00e7\u00e3o compreende as seguintes partes principais: \n\na) Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o tema e descri\u00e7\u00e3o do objeto de pesquisa, onde se sumariza \n\nos objetivos e estado da arte; \n\nb) Artigo submetido a peri\u00f3dico com corpo editorial permanente e revisores \n\nindependentes, escrito pelo autor durante o desenvolvimento de seu \n\nmestrado, com comprovante de submiss\u00e3o; \n\nc) Refer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas citadas no cap\u00edtulo 1 dessa disserta\u00e7\u00e3o; \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \n\nd) Hist\u00f3rico escolar do autor contendo as disciplinas cursadas e respectivas \n\nnotas durante o mestrado; \n\ne) Pareceres da banca examinadora composta por tr\u00eas professores doutores. \n\n \n\n1.2. OBJETIVOS \n\n \n\nO presente trabalho tem como objetivo principal avan\u00e7ar no conhecimento da \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o geol\u00f3gica e metalogen\u00e9tica da zona inferior do corpo mineralizado Ing\u00e1, do \n\ngreenstone belt de Crix\u00e1s, atrav\u00e9s da carateriza\u00e7\u00e3o petrogr\u00e1fica e geoqu\u00edmica do \n\ncorpo. \n\nEntre os objetivos espec\u00edficos, destacam-se:  \n\n- Caracterizar a petrografia e a geoqu\u00edmica das rochas hospedeiras, halos de \n\naltera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal e a mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o aur\u00edfera; \n\n- Caracterizar a associa\u00e7\u00e3o entre ouro e arsenopirita; \n\n- Discutir a g\u00eanese do corpo de min\u00e9rio Ing\u00e1; \n\n- Discutir a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de ouro na base do veio de quartzo massivo;  \n\n- Estabelecer par\u00e2metros prospectivos que a ind\u00fastria possa utilizar. \n\n \n\n1.3.

Dep\u00f3sitos de ouro do tipo veio de quartzo-carbonato em greenstone \n\nbelts \n\n \n\nDe acordo com a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de Robert et al. (1997), h\u00e1 dezesseis tipos \n\ndiferentes de dep\u00f3sitos de ouro, formados em diferentes ambientes geol\u00f3gicos e \n\nprofundidades crustais. O dep\u00f3sito de ouro do tipo veio de quartzo-carbonato em \n\ngreenstone belt \u00e9 a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o atribu\u00edda ao dep\u00f3sito e corpo de min\u00e9rio do \n\npresente estudo: Corpo Ing\u00e1, Mina de Serra Grande, greenstone belt de Crix\u00e1s \n\n(Figura 1). Alguns outros exemplos no mundo s\u00e3o: Mt.

Costumam formar dep\u00f3sitos de 1 a 10 milh\u00f5es de toneladas de min\u00e9rio a \n\n5-10 g/t Au, contendo 25-100 toneladas de Au. Al\u00e9m disso, esse tipo de dep\u00f3sito \n\npossui idades entre Arqueano m\u00e9dio e Terci\u00e1rio (Groves et al., 2003), grau \n\nmetam\u00f3rfico entre xistos verdes inferior a granulito, com mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o tardi-\n\ntect\u00f4nica a sin ou p\u00f3s pico metam\u00f3rfico, com temperatura e press\u00e3o de forma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nentre (200\u00ba-650\u00baC, 0.5-5 kbars) e flu\u00eddos de baixa salinidade (H2O-CO2 \u00b1 CH4 \u00b1 \n\nN2). Outros diagramas de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m foram elaborados por Groves et al. \n\n(1998), Hagemann e Cassidy (2000) e Bierlein e Crowe (2000). \n\n \n\n1.3.2. A Prov\u00edncia Tocantins e os greenstone belts de Goi\u00e1s \n\n \n\nA Prov\u00edncia Tocantins (Almeida et al., 1977), localizada a oeste do Cr\u00e1ton S\u00e3o \n\nFrancisco, engloba as faixas Araguaia, Bras\u00edlia, Paraguai e Arco Magm\u00e1tico de \n\nGoi\u00e1s e Maci\u00e7o de Goi\u00e1s. A regi\u00e3o oriental da Prov\u00edncia Tocantins foi subdividida \n\n(Fuck et al., 1993; Fuck, 1994) nos seguintes compartimentos tect\u00f4nicos: Zona \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n\nCrat\u00f4nica, Faixa Bras\u00edlia \u2013 Zona Externa, Faixa Bras\u00edlia \u2013 Zona Interna, Maci\u00e7o de \n\nGoi\u00e1s e Arco Magm\u00e1tico do Oeste de Goi\u00e1s. A \u00e1rea de estudo situa-se no dom\u00ednio \n\ndo Maci\u00e7o de Goi\u00e1s (Figura 2). \n\nO Maci\u00e7o de Goi\u00e1s (Barbosa et al., 1969) \u00e9 composto por terrenos granito-\n\ngreenstone belts de idade arqueana, complexos m\u00e1ficos-ultram\u00e1ficos e sequ\u00eancias \n\nvulcano-sedimentares de idade paleo-mesoproterozoicas. As rochas de idade paleo-\n\nmesoproterozoica consistem dos complexos m\u00e1ficos-ultram\u00e1ficos de Barro Alto, \n\nNiquel\u00e2ndia e Canabrava al\u00e9m das sequ\u00eancias vulcano-sedimentares de Jucel\u00e2ndia, \n\nCoitezeiro e Palmeir\u00f3polis.  Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos terrenos arqueanos no Maci\u00e7o de Goi\u00e1s \n\n(Figura 2), eles representam associa\u00e7\u00f5es de complexos granito-gn\u00e1issicos e \n\ngreenstone belts orientados NE-SW com limites inteiramente tect\u00f4nicos. A norte e \n\noeste est\u00e3o limitados com o Arco Magm\u00e1tico de Goi\u00e1s representado por rochas \n\nmetavulc\u00e2nicas, metassedimentares e gn\u00e1issicas de idade neoproteroz\u00f3ica.

Yamaoka e Ara\u00fajo (1988) dividiram o corpo de min\u00e9rio Mina III em quatro \n\nzonas: superior, intermedi\u00e1ria, inferior e zona da granada. Na zona superior a \n\nmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o ocorre na forma de lentes de sulfeto maci\u00e7o hospedados em m\u00e1rmore \n\ndolom\u00edtico, quartzo-clorita-carbonato-sericita xistos, pirrotita-magnetita-biotita xistos, \n\nclorita-granada xistos, granaditos, muscovita xistos, muscovita-clorita xistos e biotita \n\nm\u00e1rmores (Jost &amp; Fortes 2001). O ouro ocorre em associa\u00e7\u00e3o com arsenopirita, \n\npirrotita, calcopirita, carbonatos, quartzo, micas e \u00f3xidos. Na zona intermedi\u00e1ria \n\nocorre a zona da granada associada, al\u00e9m de um veio de quartzo concordante \n\nhospedado em quartzo-clorita-muscovita-granada xisto.

Located in the supracrustal rocks, Ing\u00e1 is \n\ndivided into Upper and Lower Zones. The Upper Zone contains massive sulfide lenses hosted in \n\ndolomites. The Lower Zone was systematically studied by XRD, XRF, ICP-MS, EMP and LA-ICP-\n\nMS. It is controlled by a major low angle thrust fault (Structure III) and lithologies include, from top \n\nto bottom: dolomites, carbonaceous phyllite (GXN), major quartz vein (VQZ), quartz-chlorite-sericite-\n\ngarnet schist, and metagraywacke with two types of rare cross-cutting dikes. Hydrothermal alteration \n\nhaloes developed outwards from Structure III: silicification, potassic, phyllic and carbonatic. \n\nMineralization occurs in three different stages. Three types of arsenopyrite were identified: Aspy1 \n\n(early hydrothermal), Aspy2 (late hydrothermal, possibly invisible gold-rich) and Aspy3 (later \n\nhydrothermal, visible gold-rich as inclusions, filling fractures or along its margins). Visible gold also \n\noccurs as free crystals in the VQZ basal levels and in the GXN matrix. Possible remobilization of \n\ninferred invisible gold in Aspy2 to form visible gold in Aspy3 along late crystal fractures and selective \n\nalteration towards the margins occurred as consequence of F2 folding, increasing the orebody gold \n\nbudget. The Bi ppm x Se ppm and S percent x Bi ppm plots and major gains in As, Ni and Co in the \n\narsenopyrite rich GXN silicification zone could be used to identify potentially gold rich zones. Four \n\nprospective parameters were established: VQZ, Aspy2 and Aspy3, accommodation faults, and \n\nsilicification zone.\n\nIntroduction \n\nCorrectly understanding mineral occurrence controls is a major concern for brownfields and \n\ngreenfields exploration efforts worldwide. In the Crix\u00e1s greenstone belt terrane (18.73 Moz Au), in the \n\nGoi\u00e1s Massif (southern portion of Tocantins Province), gold orebodies are stacked in a \n\nmetamorphosed volcano-sedimentary stratigraphic sequence. The three types of gold mineralization \n\npresent in the world-class Crix\u00e1s Gold District (quartz-vein, disseminated, and massive sulfide) have \n\nkey microscale characteristics that have to be considered in exploration efforts: arsenopyrite with or \n\nwithout visible gold inclusions (with possible remobilization) and visible/invisible gold within bands \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n\nof the major quartz veins. Analytical interpretation at the microscale must then be completed to \n\ndevelop reliable macroscale prospective parameters for exploration teams. \n\nWorld-class AngloGold Ashanti \u2013 Serra Grande Unit in the Crix\u00e1s Gold District, part of the \n\nCrix\u00e1s greenstone belt terrane, is the fourth largest gold deposit currently in operation in Brazil in \n\nregard to production. More than 23.2 Mt of ore at 5.97 g/t Au (4.19 Moz of Au) have already been \n\nextracted from the beginning of its production in 1986 to 2017. Reserves and global resources as of \n\nDecember 31th, 2017 were 6.68 Moz Au from more than 50.67 Mt at an average grade of 4.10 g/t Au. \n\nThe gold distribution at the Crix\u00e1s Gold District is controlled by thrust faults and spatially organized \n\nin many different orebodies. The Ing\u00e1 orebody is divided into Upper and Lower Zones and contains \n\n0.59 Moz Au from more than 3.14 Mt at an average grade of 5.91 g/t Au, as of December 31th, 2017. \n\nThe present study focuses on the Lower Zone of the orebody. Ing\u00e1 orebody is an important segment of \n\nthe Crix\u00e1s Gold District and its study presents an opportunity to contribute to exploration in the area. \n\nMapping, petrography, and whole rock analysis of wall rocks and hydrothermal zones provide \n\nthe geochemical signature for major and trace elements within orebodies (Barrett et al., 1998; Dube et \n\nal., 2007; Wilkinson et al., 2015; Gregory et al., 2016; Lebrun et al., 2017). Furthermore, X-ray \n\ndiffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron microprobe (EMP) are used \n\nextensively to identify hydrothermal alteration haloes and minerals (e.g. Dube et al., 2007; Duuring et \n\nal., 2016; Lebrun et al., 2017). Backscattering imaging (BSE) in SEM, EMP, and LA-ICP-MS element \n\nmapping in Au bearing arsenopyrite may reveal crystal element zoning and gold remobilization (Large \n\net al., 2007, 2009; Morey et al., 2008; Ciobanu et al., 2012; Cook et al., 2013; Hazarika et al., 2013; \n\nLawley et al., 2015; Steadman and Large, 2016; Rottier et al., 2016). Through mapping, hand and drill \n\nhole sampling, petrographic microscope, XRD, whole rock geochemical analysis, SEM, EMP, LA-\n\nICP-MS, and modelling, the main objectives of this paper are: (1) petrographic and geochemical \n\ncharacterization of the host rocks, hydrothermal alteration haloes and mineralization; (2) geochemical \n\nexplanation of the arsenopyrite-gold bearing association; (3) explain the genesis of the Ing\u00e1 orebody; \n\n(4) explain the concentration of gold in the major quartz vein; (5) establish prospective parameters for \n\nthe industry. \n\nGeologic Setting \n\nRegional Geology \n\nThe Crix\u00e1s Gold District (lat 14\u00ba34\u201925\u201d S, long 49\u00b058\u201904\u201d W), in the Crix\u00e1s greenstone belt \n\nterrane, is located in the Goi\u00e1s Massif (Fig. 1A), in the southern portion of the Tocantins Province \n\n(Almeida et al., 1977; Fuck et al. 1993; Fuck, 1994), which is composed of archean-paleoproterozoic \n\ngranite-gneiss and greenstone belt terranes, mafic-ultramafic complexes, and volcano-sedimentary \n\nsequences (Barbosa et al., 1969; Pimentel et al., 2000). The greenstone belts terrains are divided into \n\nfive sub-terrains (Fig. 1B) of 6 km width and 40 to 100 km length: Crix\u00e1s (Sab\u00f3ia and Teixeira, 1980), \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n \n\nGuarinos, and Pilar de Goi\u00e1s (Jost and Oliveira, 1991) to the north and Faina and Santa Rita to the \n\nsouth (Resende et al., 1998). \n\nThe Crix\u00e1s greenstone belt is a volcano-sedimentary sequence (Jost and Oliveira, 1991) \n\nelongated in the N-NW and S-SE directions with 6 km width and 45 km in length and are composed, \n\nfrom base to top, (Sab\u00f3ia et al., 1981) by: komatiitic ultramafic rocks (C\u00f3rrego Alagadinho \n\nFormation), vesiculated and pillowed basalts (Rio Vermelho Formation) and a sequence of detritical \n\nand chemical sediments (Ribeir\u00e3o das Antas Formation). The average thicknesses are 500 m, 350 m, \n\nand 700 m, respectively. The Ribeir\u00e3o das Antas formation is subdivided into a volcano-sedimentary \n\nmember, carbonatic member, and siliciclastic member (Theodoro et al., 1995). Structural complexity \n\nin the greenstone is inferrered to be the result of an extensional phase during its formation, followed \n\nby later compressive deformation (Carvalho, 2005). The Crix\u00e1s greenstone belt is limited by two \n\nTTGs complexes: the Caiamar to the south and east, and the Anta to the west, and by the \n\nmetasedimentary sequences of Mina Inglesa and Santa Terezinha to the north.  \n\n \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1.

The C\u00f3rrego Alagadinho Formation is \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n\ncomposed of metakomatiites with spinifex texture, olivine cumulates, flux breccia, polyhedral \n\ndisjunctions, and partial or total serpentinization (Sab\u00f3ia 1979). The Rio Vermelho Formation is in \n\nabrupt contact with the C\u00f3rrego Alagadinho Formation and has toleitic basalts, amphibolites, \n\namphibole schists, and komatiitic metabasalts with primary features including: pillows, varioles, \n\nvesicles and orbicules locally preserved (Sab\u00f3ia 1979). Banded iron formations, magnesiferous \n\nformations, and metachert occur as metasedimentary intercalations (Jost and Fortes 2001). The \n\nRibeir\u00e3o das Antas Formation occurs in transitional contact with the Rio Vermelho Formation and is \n\ncomposed of carbonaceous phyllite with lenses and beds of dolomites superimposed abruptly by \n\nsiliciclastic metarritimites. Theodoro (1995) divided the Ribeir\u00e3o das Antas Formation into three \n\nmembers: (1) volcano-sedimentary; (2) carbonatic; (3) siliciclastic. \n\nStructural data obtained by Magalh\u00e3es (1991), Queiroz (1995), and referred to in unpublished \n\nreports by the staff of the mining company attest that the supracrustal rocks of Crix\u00e1s underwent four \n\nmajor deformational events: D1, D2, D3, and D4. An east-west compression with vergence to the east \n\nfollowed and formed a N-S low-angle thrust fault system, with geometry similar to a duplex. D1 is \n\nresponsible for the formation of regional, tight to isoclinal, probably upright folds with an axial \n\nsurface represented by a metamorphic foliation (S1) that is pervasive in the metasedimentary \n\nsequence. Thrust faults generated metric ruptile-ductile shear zones in which the hydrothermal fluids \n\ntook advantage as preferential pathways. The main hydrothermal event occurred during D1 (syn-\n\nmineralization). Hydrothermal activity formed the major quartz-vein mineralization type observed in \n\nthe Structure III Lower Zone orebodies, including Ing\u00e1.  \n\nThe D2 event is N-S compressive, promoting the horsening of the Santa Teresinha Sequence \n\nabove the Crix\u00e1s group rocks (stratigraphic overturning), which generated F2 folds, S2 plan-axial \n\ncleavage, and L2 stretching lineation. Metakomatiites override metabasalts which are overridden by \n\nthe metasedimentary section, during stratigraphic overturning in D2. Thin-skinned thrusting developed \n\na steep ramp to the west and a duplex to the east. The gold mineralization and associated hydrothermal \n\nalteration haloes are hosted within the duplex, which indicates that it corresponds to several stacked \n\ndilation zones interpreted as second-order thrust faults related to a major, shallowly dipping, first-\n\norder detachment fault (Jost et al., 2010). The F2 folds, in general, structurally control the \n\nmineralization plunge in the district because of D2 compression on S1 foliation, which possibly \n\npromotes remobilization. Mineralization plunge is usually parallel to F2 fold axis. These folds are \n\nrecumbent to semi-recumbent, dominantly south-vergent with south westerly dips and a weakly to \n\nmoderately developed axial plane foliation. L2 stretching lineations that formed by intersection of S2 \n\nwith S1 planes also mark the mineralization plunge. Thrust faulting due to F2 can be generated, being \n\nthe cause for local gold remobilization. \n\nThe D3 event involved an E-W compression, which resulted in large scale N-S folding, \n\npromoting the formation of post-mineralization crenulation cleavage (S3). The D3 event formed the \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nRio Vermelho Antiform (Magalh\u00e3es, 1991), folding the duplex system that formed during D1 \n\n(Carvalho, 2005). Neoproterozoic Mara Rosa Magmatic Arc rocks override the northern limit of the \n\ngreenstone belt. Minor structures of this event comprise SW-verging, semi-recumbent to recumbent \n\nfolds. The D3 event is also responsible for gold remobilization and reshaping of the orebodies to an \n\noverall 25\u00ba/N65\u00baW plunge, as well as for partial recrystallization of the hydrothermal alteration \n\nenvelopes of some of the orebodies (Jost et al., 2010). The post-mineralization D4 event was NNW-\n\nSSE to N-S compressive, forming kink bands, smooth folding, and crenulation cleavage (S4), without \n\ninfluencing the orebody geometry and gold distribution. Metamorphism of the rocks ranges from \n\ngreenschist to lower amphibolite facies (Jost et al., 2010). The Crix\u00e1s Gold District then comprises a \n\nthrust stack of seven or more major thrust sheets, separated by either discrete thrust planes or (more \n\ncommonly), complex thrust zones comprising both locally imbricated thrusts and/or high strain zones \n\nincluding several primary and altered lithologies (L.R. Rankin, pers. commun., 2004). \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n\nGeochronological data suggest that gold mineralization is restricted to the Rhyacian \n\n(Paleoproterozoic). Magmatic zircons from post-mineralization mafic dikes dated by U-Pb indicate \n\n2170 \u00b1 17 Ma (Jost et al., 2010). The basinal stage, deformation, metamorphism, and mineralization, \n\naccording to Jost et al. (2010), occurred in a 30-40 Ma range of time restricted to the Rhyacian 2.2 to \n\n2.17 Ma. The source sediments that were metamorphosed to carbonaceous phyllite and \n\nmetagraywacke have U-Pb dating of 3354 \u00b1 40 Ma to 2209 \u00b1 28 Ma, with a maximum depositional \n\nage of 2.2 Ga. The model ages of metabasalts of the Rio Vermelho Formation and metakomatiites of \n\nthe C\u00f3rrego Alagadinho Formation are Nd 2.32 Ga and 2.24 Ga, respectively (Jost et al., 2010; Fortes \n\net al., 2003). \n\nDeposit Geology \n\nThe main auriferous mineralizations of the region occur in the Crix\u00e1s greenstone belt and are \n\ncontrolled by thrust and transcurrent faults (Jost and Fortes, 2001). The area is within the AngloGold \n\nAshanti - Serra Grande Unit and the Cleveland Mining Company LTD - Premier Gold Project (Fig. \n\n1E). Three different types of gold mineralization are known: (1) Massive sulfide; (2) Quartz-vein; (3) \n\nDisseminated sulfide (Table 2).  \n\nThe massive type consists of lenses of massive sulfide concordant with S1 parallel to S2 and \n\noccurring near the contact between metabasalts and BIF of Rio Vermelho Formation or inside the \n\ndolomite layers crosscutting the stratigraphic sequence (Fortes, 1996). These lenses have 95% Po-\n\nAspy, with subordinated magnetite, ilmenite, and chalcopyrite and are 0.5\u20132.5 m in width and 50-400 \n\nm in length. The gold occurs in the massive Aspy crystals. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 2.

C) Basic geological section of main thrust fault structures. \n\nLegend of colors: green (Palmeiras Structure), red (Structure IV), blue (Structure III Upper Zone) and yellow (Structure III Lower Zone). \n\nAbbreviations: CBCX = Quartz-Chlorite-Carbonate-Sericite Schist; CXV = Chlorite-Anfibole-Carbonate Schist; DOL = Dolomite; GNCX = \n\nQuartz-Chlorite-Sericite-Garnet Schist; GXN = Carbonaceous Schist; MG = Metagraywacke; MVA = Acid Metavolcanic; SEX = Sericite-\n\nChlorite Schist; VQZ = Quartz Vein. Lenses of the above lithologies may crosscut the sequences in different levels with variable thickness. \n\nThe quartz-vein type is discontinuous and concordant with the S1 parallel to S2, having 0.5-\n\n5.0 m width and 500-1500 m length. It occurs in the carbonaceous phyllite of the Ribeir\u00e3o das Antas \n\nFormation. and has 98% recrystallized milk-quartz with disseminationed Po, Aspy, Mca, \n\ncarbonaceous matter, plagioclase, carbonate, and chlorite. The gold occurs as free crystals in the \n\nquartz vein, with the highest concentrations occurring up to 1.5 m from the footwall of the vein, \n\ninwards. The disseminated sulfide mineralization type consists of zones with 1-5 m in width and 200-\n\n1000 m in length, in the Ribeir\u00e3o das Antas Formation carbonaceous phyllite. The gold occurs in the \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite Aspy, as free crystals in quartz-veining, or in the carbonaceous phyllite gangue \n\nminerals (i.e. titanite and biotite). Other sulfide minerals are Cpy, Py, Po, and Pentlandite. The \n\norebodies at the Crix\u00e1s Gold District are classified according to the main thrust fault that controls \n\nthem, named \u201cstructures\u201d, which included, stacked from top to bottom (Table 2 and Fig. 2): Structure \n\nPalmeiras (Palmeiras and Baru orebodies), Structure IV (Pequiz\u00e3o, Forquilha, Corpo IV, Corpo V, and \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n \n\nSucupira orebodies), Structure III Upper Zone (Mina III and Ing\u00e1 orebodies) and Structure III Lower \n\nZone (Mina III, Mina Nova, and Ing\u00e1 orebodies). \n\nThe present study focus on the quartz-vein and disseminated mineralization in the Ing\u00e1 \n\norebody Lower Zone (Structure III). The Mina III Lower Zone and Mina Nova orebodies are hosted at \n\nthe same stratigraphic level as the Ing\u00e1 orebody Lower Zone in the Ribeir\u00e3o das Antas Formation, \n\nshowing similarities between them. This stratigraphic level has the highest gold grades in the district. \n\nThe Mina III started production in 1986 and is the richest orebody in the region, with 1,0 Moz Au \n\nfrom more than 6,86 Mt at an average grade of 4.53 g/t Au as of December 31th, 2017. Yamaoka and \n\nAra\u00fajo (1988) divided the Mina III orebody into four zones: upper, intermediate, lower, and garnet \n\nzone. The Mina III Lower Zone has major quartz-veins crosscutting carbonaceous phyllite, with \n\narsenopyrite and pyrite disseminated close to the vein (Jost and Fortes, 2001). Gold crystals are \n\nassociated with quartz, carbonaceous matter, and arsenopyrite. The host rocks present carbonate, \n\nsericite, silicification, and sulfide haloes and are metamorphosed and deformed in the epidote-\n\namphibolite facies (Fortes et al., 1997). The Mina Nova has 0.34 Moz Au from more than 6.52 Mt at \n\nan average grade of 3.26 g/t Au as of December 31, 2017. The orebody is hosted in carbonaceous \n\nphyllite and its mineralization includes: Po, Aspy, and Cpy disseminated in carbonaceous phyllite; \n\nAspy, Po, and Cpy disseminated in sericite-carbonate schist; Aspy disseminated in quartz-veins \n\ncrosscutting carbonaceous phyllite (Portocarrero, 1996). \n\n The Ing\u00e1 orebody is divided into Upper and Lower Zones regarding mineralization style. In \n\nthe Upper Zone the mineralization occurs as massive sulfide lenses hosted in dolomites. In the Lower \n\nZone, the object of this study, the mineralization occurs in association with a thick, discontinuous \n\nquartz vein and adjacent carbonaceous phyllite, associated with arsenopyrite, pyrrothite, and \n\nsubordinated pyrite. The Lower Zone comprises the following host rocks, from top to bottom: \n\nbrecciated dolomitic marbles, carbonaceous phyllite, quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist, and \n\nmetagraywackes. Hydrothermal alteration over carbonaceous phyllite adjacent to the thick quartz vein \n\nconsists of: silicification, phyllic (muscovite) and carbonatic alteration outwards with pods of potassic \n\nalteration (biotite). No previous publications and few company reports are available for the Ing\u00e1 \n\norebody. \n\nSampling and Analytical Methods \n\nThe present contribution reports the study conducted between 2015 and 2018, with data \n\ncollected in AngloGold Ashanti \u2013 Serra Grande Unit and the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do \n\nSul (UFRGS). Two hundred and eighty meters of four drill holes selected in a 203-023\u00b0 section \n\nperpendicular to the Ing\u00e1 orebody plunge were geologically described and eighty-two drill core \n\nsamples were collected. Other fifty-one drill core samples from thirty five drill holes were collected in \n\na 250 x 250 x 250 m grid through the Ing\u00e1 orebody. Twenty-two hand samples were collected during \n\nunderground mapping of 112 meters of the Ing\u00e1 orebody\u00b4s 730N galleries with a 1:100 scale and 3 m \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \n\nhigh projection. From the samples collected, sixty-one were selected for petrographic description of \n\npolished thin sections under a LEICA DM LP microscope. The sampling approach prioritized different \n\nlithotypes, hydrothermal alteration, gold grades, deformation, visual percentage of sulfides and/or \n\nvisible gold. The drill core described in the study are totally assayed by 30g gold fire assay analysis \n\ndone on 0.8 \u2013 1.2m samples by AngloGold Ashanti \u2013 Serra Grande Unit industrial laboratory, with \n\nlower detection limit of 0.025 ppm. Samples for whole-rock analysis were also analyzed by ALS \n\nMinerals 30g fire assay with detection limit of 0.005 ppm. Leapfrog Geo 4.2, Reflex IoGAS 6.3.1, \n\nArcGIS 10.1, and Datamine Studio 3 softwares were used for data analysis and modelling. \n\nXRD and Whole-rock Analysis \n\nTwenty samples from a vertical section of drill holes XIGE-0066 and XIGE-0023 were \n\nanalyzed with XRD. Ten samples were analyzed for whole-rock and clay identification in Weatherford \n\nLaboratories (SIEMENS BRUKER AXS D4 Endeavor) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with softwares MDI \n\nJade 9+ 2009 and PDF 4+ 2010. Ten samples were analyzed for clay identification in the \n\nDiffractometry Laboratory at UFRGS (SIEMENS BRUKER AXS DS5000) in Porto Alegre, Brazil \n\nwith softwares DIFFRAC \u2013 PLUS-EVA and NEWMOD. The database utilized was the ICDD JCPDS. \n\nScanning patterns for whole rock and clay analysis were Cu K? (0,15406 nm), K? 2 (0,1544390 nm), \n\n40 Kv, 40 mA, goniometer diameter of 402 mm and variable divergent gap of  1,5 mm for whole rock \n\nand 0,75 mm for clay.  \n\nSixty-one samples from thirty-nine drill holes were analyzed for whole rock major and trace \n\nelement characterization. Fifty-one samples are spaced in a 250 x 250 x 250 grid and ten samples are \n\nin a vertical section of four drill holes - both sample sets located through the Ing\u00e1 orebody. The \n\nsampling approach focused on the carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist \n\nlithologies with background, low, and high gold grades. Analyses were conducted by ALS Minerals in \n\nGoi\u00e2nia and Vespasiano, Brazil (physical preparation) and Lima, Peru (chemical analysis). The \n\nphysical preparation consisted of weighing, splitting, milling, pulverization to 70% less than 2 mm, \n\nsplitting, and pulverization to 80% less than 75 \u00b5m. The chemical analysis consisted of whole rock \n\nanalysis by fusion/x-ray fluorescence (XRF), loss on ignition by XRF-WST-SEQ, inductively coupled \n\nplasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), total carbon and sulfur measurements by LECO, lithium \n\nborate fusion with ICP-MS and four acid digestion of base metals with inductively coupled plasma \u2013 \n\natomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). \n\nSEM and EMP Analysis \n\nTwelve thin sections were analyzed by the SEM facility in the UFRGS Isotopic Geology \n\nLaboratory equipped with a JEOL JSM-6610LV with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) Bruker \n\n133 eV. The focus was the characterization of mineral phases, spot analysis and compositional \n\nmapping with semi-quantitative EDS, and textural analysis of gold crystals and sulfides by BSE \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n\nimaging. Five thin sections were analyzed for spot, line sections and element mapping with \n\nwavelength dispersion spectrometry (WDS) using EMP. Two thin sections had garnet, biotite and \n\nchlorite crystals analyzed at the UFRGS Electron Microprobe Laboratory equipped with a Cameca \n\nSXFive EMP with operation conditions of 15 keV, 20 nA, 1 \u00b5m for garnet, and 15 keV, 15 nA, 10 \u00b5m \n\nfor biotite and chlorite. Four thin sections had arsenopyrite, biotite, muscovite and chlorite crystals \n\nanalyzed at the Queen\u2019s University EMP Laboratory equipped with a JEOL JXA-8230 EMP with \n\noperation conditions of 20 keV, 50 nA, and focused beam for arsenopyrite, and 15 keV, 10 nA, and 7 \n\n\u00b5m for biotite, muscovite and chlorite. \n\nLA-ICP-MS Analysis \n\nOne thin section was selected for chemical arsenopyrite analysis by LA-ICP-MS.  Three \n\nelement mapping zones and eighteen spot analyses were obtained on arsenopyrite crystals considering \n\nits core, margins, and fractures. Analyses were performed at Queen\u2019s University using a 193 nm ArF \n\nExcimer laser (Elemental Scientific Lasers NWR193) interfaced with a Thermo Scientific X-Series 2 \n\nQuadrupole ICPMS using He as a carrier gas. Laser diameter was set to 10 \u00b5m with a scan speed of 5 \n\n\u00b5m/s and a repetition rate of 30 Hz to ensure the best possible resolution for the maps. Ar (sample gas) \n\nand He (carrier gas) flows were optimised on a daily basis for best sensitivity (~10e5 counts/s on \n\n238U for NIST 612 reference glass) while keeping the oxide level as low as possible (<1%). Gas \n\nblanks were measured before and after each line for a minimum of 20 seconds. A typical measurement \n\nsequence consisted of a block of NIST 614, 612, and 610 reference glasses used to generate individual \n\nlinear calibrations for all elements, followed by certified reference basalt glass BCR-2G (USGS), the \n\ngoal of which was to both validate the calibration generated by the NIST glasses and to extend the \n\ncalibration for elements such as Fe or S (NIST glasses having very similar Fe and S contents). \n\nSulphide pellet reference MASS-1 was run at the end of each set of calibrations to readjust the \n\ncalibration generated on silicate reference glasses, in order to matrix match the samples. NIST glasses \n\nas well as BCR-2G and MASS-1 were run at regular time intervals during the sequences. At the end of \n\neach sequence, another complete set of calibrations were generated. Data reduction was performed on \n\nIolite v3.63. The data reduction routine consisted of a gas blank subtraction for each individual line, as \n\nwell as interpolation between calibrations to correct for any potential drift during the sequence (i.e. \n\ninstrumental drift of the ICPMS, small variations in laser output, etc). Results files generated on the \n\nICPMS were then combined with the laser logs to generate maps. \n\nResults \n\nHost Rocks and Hydrothermal Alteration \n\nThe host rocks at Ing\u00e1 orebody Lower Zone are metamorphic assemblages with superimposed \n\nhydrothermal alteration (Fig. 3). Petrography, whole-rock geochemistry, SEM, and XRD were used to \n\ncharacterize alteration in terms of mineralogical assemblages and geochemistry. The host rock \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \n\nstratigraphy is, from top-down: dolomite, carbonaceous phyllite (GXN), major quartz vein (VQZ), \n\nquartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist (GNCX), and metagraywacke (Fig. 1D, Fig. 4A-B). Rare dikes of \n\nbiotite-chlorite schist (BCS) and quartz-garnet-sericite schist (QGSS) crosscut the sequence. A mafic \n\ndike is suggested as protolith for both dikes, which is intensely hydrothermally altered and with its \n\nmatrix substituted. Lenses of GNCX inside carbonaceous phyllite and lenses of dolomite inside \n\nGNCX and carbonaceous phyllite are rare. \n\n \n\nFig. 3. Ing\u00e1 orebody stratigraphic section. Drill holes studied have underlined names: II-485, XIGE0023, XIGE0055, and XIGE0066. \n\nAbbreviations: GNCX = Quartz-Chlorite-Sericite-Garnet Schist; GXN = Carbonaceous Schist. \n\nThe dolomite is > 9.4m thick and has a gradual-diffuse lower contact with the carbonaceous \n\nphyllite and a diffuse upper contact with the metabasalt or quartz-chlorite-carbonate-sericite schist. \n\nThree types of dolomite are identified based on texture: massive (Fig. 4C), brecciated (Fig. 4G), and \n\nlaminated (Fig. 4H). The massive dolomite has uniform rounded carbonate-quartz-feldspar crystals, \n\nwhile the brecciated dolomite has large allotriomorphic carbonate-quartz-feldspar crystals, with \n\nquartz-plagioclase being more abundant. The laminated dolomite contain fine carbonate-quartz-\n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n\nfeldspar crystals oriented along S1 parallel to S2. The dolomite color varies from light gray to white, \n\nwith green pockets mm to &lt;8 cm in thickness related to a high concentration of chlorite-biotite. It \n\ncontains centimetric to decimetric carbonaceous phyllite lenses where quartz-carbonate millimeter-\n\nscale venulations may occur. Due to folding of the sequence, dolomite lenses occur in the GNCX. \n\nMineral assemblage shows that dolomite and ankerite comprise 88 vol%, quartz 4 vol%, feldspar 2 \n\nvol%, biotite 2 vol%, pyrrothite 1.5 vol%, illite/muscovite/kaolinite 1 vol%, plagioclase &lt;1 vol%, \n\nzircon and titanite &lt;1 vol%, chalcopyrite &lt;1 vol%, and roscoelite &lt;1 vol%. \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4.

Abbreviations: Aspy = arsenopyrite.  \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n\nThe biotite-chlorite schist (BCS) dike is &lt;2.54 m thick and has a diffuse upper contact with \n\ndolomite and an abrupt lower contact with the carbonaceous phyllite (Fig. 4D). The BCS dike color is \n\ndark green due to intense chloritization. Quartz-carbonate venulations and pockets, and punctuations \n\nof biotite and sericite are common. Mineral assemblage show quartz 38 vol%, chlorite 25 vol%, \n\nfeldspar 19 vol%, biotite 10 vol%, carbonate 3 vol%, carbonaceous matter 3 vol%, sericite 1 vol%, \n\nplagioclase &lt;1 vol%, ilmenite &lt;1 vol%, and magnetite &lt;1 vol%. \n\nThe quartz-garnet-sericite schist (QGSS) dike is &lt;1.53 m thick and has abrupt lower and \n\nupper contact with carbonaceous phyllite (Fig. 4E). The QGSS color is greenish dark gray punctuated \n\nby light gray garnet crystals. Quartz-carbonate sub-mm to mm venulations are common. Mineral \n\nassemblage show quartz 20 vol%, white mica 28 vol%, garnet 13 vol%, carbonaceous matter 13 vol%, \n\nbiotite 10 vol%, feldspar 5 vol%, ilmenite 3 vol%, hornblende 2 vol%, pyrrhotite &lt;1-4 vol%, \n\nchalcopyrite 1 vol%, carbonate &lt;1 vol%, chlorite &lt;1 vol%, Aspy1 &lt;1 vol%, magnetite and \n\npentlandite &lt;1 vol%. \n\nThe major quartz-vein is 0.14 to 2.49 m thick and has abrupt upper and lower contact with \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite (Fig. 4J). It generally crosscuts the carbonaceous phyllite near its lower contact \n\nwith GNCX. It is mainly milky and commonly folded, with scarce glassy or smoky textured portions \n\nthat are discontinuous. This vein commonly contains intensely foliated carbonaceous phyllite slivers, \n\nwith irregular shapes, chlorite, and tourmaline (Fig. 4I). Centimetric irregular carbonate venulations \n\nare common. The VQZ is the main feature of the thrust structure III, parallel to oblique to it, and \n\nrepresents the main mining target of the Ing\u00e1 orebody Lower Zone. The major quartz vein represents a \n\nset of crack and seal veining formed due to permeability anisotropy within the carbonaceous schist. It \n\ncan be also classified as fault-fill veining according to Robert and Poulsen (2001). \n\nThe central part of the VQZ represents the merging and juxtaposition of numerous quartz \n\nveinlets. On its vertical terminations, the VQZ grades into metric-decimetric sheeted veinlet zone to \n\ncentimentric isolated veinlets. Late steeply dipping, centimetric-decimetric quartz veins, with \n\ncarbonaceous material and minimal wall rock displacement suggests emplacement along a tension \n\nfracture within the major quartz vein. Mesoscopically, the quartz is mainly laminated, commonly \n\nseparated by slip surfaces enhanced by the presence of chlorite and tourmaline. Striations are present \n\nin these slip surfaces and are sub-parallel to the elongation lineation in the foliated carbonaceous \n\nphyllite. The individual laminae are parallel to subparallel to the vein margins. The free gold related to \n\nVQZ concentrates up to 0.9 m inwards from the footwall contact with the carbonaceous phyllite. In the \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite slivers inside VQZ, commonly occurs two generations of arsenopyrite, in which \n\nthe later contains gold as inclusions, filling fractures or in its margins. With increased F2 folding, gold \n\ngrades become progressively higher towards F2 fold axis. The mineral assemblage is composed by \n\nquartz 95-97 vol%, chlorite 2 vol%, carbonate 1%, carbonaceous matter &lt;1 to 1 vol%, white mica &lt;1 \n\nto 1 vol%, biotite &lt;1 vol%, tourmaline &lt;1 vol%, and gold 0 to &lt;1 vol%. \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\n \n\nThe metagraywacke is > 13.73 m thick and has a diffuse and interdigitated upper contact with \n\nthe GNCX (Fig. 4N). Its lower contact is unknown since no drill hole has ever crossed another \n\nlithology below the metagraywacke in the Ing\u00e1 orebody due to drill hole depths and the lack of \n\neconomic gold concentrations within the metagraywacke in this region. The metagraywacke is dark \n\ngray in color. Interdigitated lenses of GNCX are present and common with a 0.5 to &lt;5 cm size-range. \n\nThe original rhythmic layering of the graywacke is preserved, with graded bedding, cross-lamination, \n\ncut and fill, and local intraformational breccias with irregular clasts of carbonaceous phyllite. Rare \n\nquartz-carbonate millimetric venulations occur. Mineral assemblage shows almost equal proportions \n\nof quartz, biotite and albite, oligoclase or andesine, locally muscovite, with minor zircon, magnetite, \n\nilmenite, rutile and apatite, as well as millimetric sized rock fragments with quartz, plagioclase and \n\nbiotite. \n\nHydrothermal Alteration Assemblage \n\n The hydrothermal alteration zoning is characterized by four main haloes and \n\nrespective assemblages that affect the carbonaceous phyllite and the quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet \n\nschist (GNCX), in the following sequence: Carbonatic, Phyllic, Potassic, and Silicification haloes (Fig. \n\n3, Table 3A and 3B). The haloes together sum 36 to 83 meters thick in the drill holes studied. \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5. Ing\u00e1 orebody hydrothermal alteration zoning and gold mineralization.

Abbreviations: Ank = ankerite, Aspy = arsenopyrite, Au = gold, Bt = biotite, GXN = carbonaceous phyllite, Cpy \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n\n= chalcopyrite, Dol = dolomite, Grt = garnet, Ilm = ilmenite, Ilt = illite, Kln = kaolinite, Mag = magnetite, Po = pyrrothite, GNCX = quartz-\n\nchlorite-sericite-garnet schist, Qz = quartz, Rt = rutile. \n\n The carbonatic halo affects the carbonaceous phyllite pervasively with thicknesses of 1.2 to \n\n17.6 meters, which decrease progressively along the Ing\u00e1 orebody plunge, reflecting the decrease in \n\nthickness of the adjacent dolomite up the stratigraphic sequence (Fig. 5A). It presents a diffuse gradual \n\nupper contact with the dolomites and a diffuse gradual lower contact with the phyllic zone \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite. Carbonates in this halo were identified by SEM and XRD as mainly dolomite, \n\nwith subordinated ankerite and calcite. The dolomite is suggested as the source of CaCO3 for the \n\ncarbonatic halo. Metric to decimetric intercalations of carbonaceous phyllite from carbonatic halo and \n\nthe phyllic halo commonly occur due to deformation. Rare BCS dikes crosscut the carbonatic halo. \n\nThe carbonaceous phyllite in this halo presents medium gray color, which varies in tone with more or \n\nless carbonaceous matter or carbonate abundance. It presents a fairly common brecciated aspect and \n\nalso centimetric greenish zones due to chlorite alteration. Carbonate pockets and veins are common \n\nwith millimeter to centimeter sizes. Hydrothermalized mafic pockets are common along all of the \n\ncarbonatic halo and consist of a carbonate-sericite-biotite-chlorite-quartz assemblage.  \n\nGeneral mineral assemblage of the carbonatic halo over the carbonaceous phyllite show \n\ndolomite/ankerite/calcite &lt;1 to 87 vol%, quartz 10-20 vol%, chlorite 0-15 vol%, carbonaceous matter \n\n3-10 vol%, feldspar 3-5 vol%, illite/muscovite/kaolinite 0-5 vol%, biotite 0-2 vol%, plagioclase 0-1 \n\nvol%, clinozoisite &lt;1 vol%, titanite, and zircon &lt;1 vol%. Ore mineralogy includes: pyrrhotite 0-2 \n\nvol%, pentlandite &lt;1 vol%, ilmenite &lt;1 vol%, chalcopyrite &lt;1 vol%, Aspy1 &lt;1 vol%, rutile 0-1 \n\nvol%, and magnetite &lt;1 vol%.  \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Phyllic halo pervasively selective affects the carbonaceous phyllite and the GNCX, with \n\nthicknesses of 1.7 to 14.2 m, thickening progressively along the Ing\u00e1 orebody plunge (Fig. 4L and 4M, \n\nFig. 5B and 5E). The carbonaceous phyllite has a diffuse gradational upper contact with the carbonatic \n\nhalo and a diffuse gradational lower contact with the potassic halo. For the GNCX, it has a diffuse \n\ngradational upper contact with the potassic halo and a diffuse interdigitated lower contact with the \n\nmetagraywacke. White mica in this halo was identified by SEM, XRD, and EMP as being mainly \n\nphengitic muscovite, with subordinated illite and kaolinite. Millimeter to centimeter-scale quartz veins \n\nare common, with assimilated host rock fragments. Sub-millimetric carbonate veining is rare. \n\nCentimeter to meter-scale light gray levels present subordinated potassic alteration pervasively \n\nselective overprinting the phyllic alteration. The phyllic halo on carbonaceous phyllite rarely present \n\ndisperse carbonaceous matter clasts concentrated in centimetric levels. This is common in the GNCX, \n\nwhich indicates metagraywacke contribution. Late subordinated chloritization is common. QGSS \n\ndikes rarely crosscut the phyllic halo carbonaceous phyllite. Dolomite lenses rarely crosscut the \n\nGNCX. \n\n The general mineral assemblage of the phyllic halo over the carbonaceous phyllite includes: \n\nquartz 20-40 vol%, white mica 8-30 vol%, carbonaceous matter 4-30 vol%, biotite 5-20 vol%, garnet \n\n0-12 vol%, carbonate 0-13 vol%, k-feldspar 4-8 vol%, chlorite 1-6 vol%, clinozoisite 0-3 vol%, \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n\nplagioclase 0-1 vol%, titanite &lt;1 vol%, zircon &lt;1 vol%. Ore mineralogy includes: pyrrothite 1-4 \n\nvol%, chalcopyrite 1 vol%, ilmenite&lt;1 to 2.5 vol%, Aspy1 &lt;1 vol%, rutile &lt;1 vol%, magnetite &lt;1 \n\nvol%, and pentlandite &lt;1 vol%. General mineral assemblage of the phyllic halo over the quartz-\n\nchlorite-sericite-garnet schist include: quartz 20-40 vol%, white mica 15-35 vol%, carbonaceous \n\nmatter 5-25 vol%, biotite 6-15 vol%, garnet 4-13 vol%, k-feldspar 4-8 vol%, chlorite 1-4 vol%, \n\nhornblende 0-4 vol%, clinozoisite 0-5 vol%, carbonate&lt;1 vol%, and plagioclase &lt;1 vol%. Ore \n\nmineralogy includes: pyrrhotite &lt;1 to 3 vol%, chalcopyrite &lt;1 vol%, ilmenite &lt;1 to 1 vol%, \n\nmagnetite &lt;1 vol%, and pentlandite &lt;1 vol%. \n\n The potassic halo affects the carbonaceous phyllite and the GNCX pervasively-selective with \n\nthickness of 1.6 to 17.3 meters, increasing progressively along the Ing\u00e1 orebody plunge (Fig. 4L, Fig. \n\n5C and 5F). It presents a gradational and diffuse contact with the phyllic and silicification halo in both \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite and GNCX. The ferri-biotite was identified as characteristic of this halo by \n\nSEM, XRD, and EMP and it occurs as an abrupt overprinting of the phyllic alteration, giving a \n\nyellowish dark gray coloration to the host rock. Garnets become light gray due to this overprint. \n\nPosterior decimetric quartz-carbonate venulations are common, containing carbonaceous phyllite or \n\nGNCX fragments. Late rare subordinated pervasive silicification occurs related to this veining, \n\nincreasing abundance towards the major quartz vein. It presents disperse carbonaceous matter clasts \n\nconcentrated in some centimetric levels indicating metagraywacke contribution. \n\nGeneral mineral assemblage of the potassic halo over the carbonaceous phyllite includes: \n\nquartz 20-40 vol%, carbonaceous matter 1-23 vol%, biotite 15-20 vol%, garnet 0-12 vol%, apatite 0-\n\n11 vol%, k-feldspar 4-8%, white mica 0-4 vol%, chlorite 0-3 vol%, carbonate &lt;1 vol%, titanite &lt;1 \n\nvol%, plagioclase &lt;1 vol%, zircon &lt;1 vol%. Ore mineralogy includes: pyrrhotite 0-3 vol%, ilmenite \n\n0-2 vol%, chalcopyrite &lt;1 vol%, Aspy1 &lt;1 vol%, magnetite &lt;1 vol%, and pentlandite &lt;1 vol%. \n\nGeneral mineral assemblage of the potassic halo over the GNCX includes: quartz 20-40 vol%, biotite \n\n17-25 vol%, carbonaceous matter 2-25 vol%, white mica 0-20 vol%, hornblende 0-23 vol%, garnet 4-\n\n13 vol%, chlorite 1-10 vol%, k-feldspar 4-8 vol%, carbonate &lt;1 vol%, zircon &lt;1 vol%. Ore \n\nmineralogy includes: pyrrothite&lt;1-1.5 vol%, chalcopyrite &lt;1 vol%, ilmenite &lt;1 vol%, Aspy1 &lt;1 \n\nvol%, magnetite &lt;1 vol%, and pentlandite &lt;1 vol%. \n\nThe silicification halo (Fig. 4F and 4K, Fig. 5D) affects the carbonaceous phyllite pervasively \n\nwith thickness of 0.8 to 17.7 meters outwards from the major quartz vein (VQZ). Its thickness has a \n\npositive correlation with the thickness of the major quartz vein, decreasing progressively along the \n\nIng\u00e1 orebody plunge. The silicification intensity is determined by the abundance of quartz crystals and \n\nincreases towards the thrust structure III and VQZ. Its upper and lower limits are in gradational, \n\ndiffuse contact with the potassic halo, overprinting it. It presents dark gray color varying to lighter \n\ntones due to silicification intensity. Carbonaceous phyllite and milky quartz veins occur interdigitated \n\nin decimetric intervals due to the assimilation of quartz veins. In intervals of very high silicification, \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n \n\ngarnet disappears. When the silicification halo reaches the GNCX, the silicification almost ceases due \n\nto the reactivity differences between silicification and the host rock, marking the lower limit of the \n\nsilicification halo. QGCS dikes rarely crosscut this halo and do so with abrupt contacts. In the \n\nsilicification halo, particularly in the venulations, millimetric chlorite occurs disseminated over the \n\nquartz with 1-5 vol%. Free gold and gold in the Aspy3 concentrates in the carbonaceous phyllite \n\nmainly in the hanging-wall of the major quartz vein. The carbonaceous phyllite in the footwall of the \n\nVQZ, which contains Aspy1, rarely contains gold as free crystals within the matrix. \n\nMeasured foliation data (n=58) in the Ing\u00e1 carbonaceous schist (Fig. 6) show an average \n\nazimuth value of 229\u00ba (200-300\u00b0) and an average dip value of 39\u00ba (25-66\u00ba). Measured L2 stretching \n\nlineation data (n=50), that marks the mineralization plunge, show an average trend value of 275\u00ba (260-\n\n315\u00ba) and an average plunge value of 27\u00ba (20-57\u00ba). S0 was not observed in Ing\u00e1 orebody due to the \n\npenetrative character of the S1 foliation. S0 and S1 foliation in the Ing\u00e1 orebody are assumed to be \n\nparallel to sub-parallel to S2. The axial surface of F2 folds are rarely physically present, marked by the \n\nrotation of mica flakes formed during D1, thus statistically few F2 fold axis measurements were \n\ncollected. S3 and S4 foliations were not observed at Ing\u00e1 orebody gallery. S3 foliation was observed in \n\nIng\u00e1 exploration drill holes, but as the drill holes were not oriented, it was not possible to get absolute \n\nmeasurements. \n\n \n\nFig. 6. Carbonaceous phyllite S2 foliation (n = 58) and L2 lineation (n = 50) stereonets. Equal-area Schmidt projection. \n\nGeneral mineral assemblage of the silicification halo over the carbonaceous phyllite includes: \n\nquartz 25-60 vol%, biotite 2-30 vol%, white mica 0-32 vol%, garnet 0-25 vol%, carbonaceous matter \n\n0-30 vol%, carbonate 0-15 vol%, clinozoisite 0-10 vol%, k-feldspar 4-7 vol%, hornblende 0-7 vol%, \n\nchlorite 0-5 vol%, apatite 0-5 vol%, tourmaline 0-4 vol%, plagioclase 0-2 vol%, roscoelite &lt;1 vol%, \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n\ntitatine &lt;1 vol%, and zircon &lt;1 vol%. Ore mineralogy includes: Aspy2 and Aspy3 0-15 vol%, \n\npyrrhothite &lt;1-8 vol%, ilmenite 0-5 vol%, chalcopyrite 0-1 vol%, Aspy1 &lt;1 vol%, magnetite &lt;1 \n\nvol%, pentlandite &lt;1 vol%, rutile &lt;1 vol%, and gold &lt;1 vol%. \n\nHydrothermal Alteration Geochemistry \n\nThe main hydrothermal minerals in the area were analysed in detail, including: carbonates, \n\nwhite mica, biotite, quartz, chlorite, and garnet. The carbonate (0-87 vol%), in the alteration haloes \n\nwas analyzed by SEM and quantitative analysis in XRD (n=20) with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-\n\nchlorite-sericite-garnet schist as host rocks. Carbonate crystals are &lt;0.003 to 2.4 mm in size and occur \n\nin three ways: (1) crystalline aggregates in venulations and pockets, (2) crystalline aggregates in the \n\nmatrix, and (3) amorphous tardi disseminated aggregates on other crystals in the matrix. Type three \n\nrarely occurs in Aspy2 and Aspy3 fractures and margins. Carbonate crystals acquire a strained shape \n\nwhen oriented along S2 foliation, but mainly are rounded with no preferred orientation. Carbonate \n\ncrystals are pointed by submillimetric carbonaceous matter with a quartz and illite/kaolinite overprint, \n\nlending a dirty aspect to the crystal. Carbonate1 and Carbonate2 composition is mainly ankerite with \n\nsubordinated calcite and very rare dolomite in the phyllic and potassic zones over GXN and GNCX \n\nand in the silicification zone over GXN. In the carbonatic zone, the Carbonate1 and Carbonate2 \n\ncomposition is mainly dolomite with rare calcite. Carbonate3 composition is calcite in all \n\nhydrothermal alteration haloes. \n\n White mica in the alteration haloes (0-35 vol%) was analyzed by SEM, quantitative analysis in \n\nEMP (n=48) and in XRD (n=20) with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist \n\nas host rocks (Table 5). White mica crystals are &lt;0.003 to 0.25 mm in size and occurs as aggregates in \n\ntwo ways: (1) disseminated in the matrix or (2) in quartz-carbonate microvenulations. White mica1 \n\noccurs mainly along S2 foliation but also is common oblique/perpendicular to S2 foliation. White \n\nmica1 has weak to regular cleavage while White mica2 has good cleavage. White mica1 and 2 show \n\npartial to total alteration to chlorite. White mica1 and 2 compositions are the same (Fig. 8G), classified \n\nas phengitic muscovite: Fe+Mg (0.27-0.49; Avg 0.36), K (1.66-1.78; Avg 1.73), Al iv (1.70-1.97; Avg \n\n1.86), Al vi (3.54-3.78; Avg 3.67), and Al total (5.24-5.75; Avg 5.53). Fine-grained white mica &lt;\n\n0.003 mm that forms argilominerals is classified as kaolinite and illite by XRD analysis. Particularly \n\nin the carbonatic zone, the phengitic muscovite occurs in mafic hydrothermalized pockets. \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n \n\n Biotite in the alteration haloes (0-30 vol%) was analyzed by SEM and quantitative analysis in \n\nEMP (n=48), with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist as host rocks (Table \n\n5). Biotite crystals are &lt;0.003 to 0.3 mm in size, commonly fragmented, and display light to dark-\n\norange pleochroism. Biotite occurs in two ways: (1) disseminated in the matrix along the S2 foliation \n\nand (2) oblique/perpendicular to S2 foliation forming crystal aggregates without preferred orientation \n\nand with variable sizes. The Biotite1 is interpreted to be of metamorphic origin and Biotite2 is \n\ninterpreted to be hydrothermal. Biotite1 crystals are allotriomorphic to hipidiomorphic in shape, \n\nshowing weak to regular cleavage. Biotite2 crystals are hipidiomorphic to idiomorphic in shape \n\nshowing regular to good cleavage and darker orange tones in pleochroism. Biotite1 and 2 show partial \n\nto total alteration to late chlorite. Biotite1 and Biotite2 compositions are approximately the same (Fig. \n\n8E), classified as ferri-biotite according to the classification diagram by Speer (1981) and Deer et al. \n\n(1986): Fe/(Fe+Mg) (0.43-0.57; Avg 0.48), Al iv (2.43-2.58; Avg 2.50) and Al (total) (3.22-3.48; Avg \n\n3.36). Particularly in the carbonatic zone, the Biotite2 occurs in mafic hydrothermalized pockets. \n\n Chlorite in the alteration haloes (0-15 vol%) was analyzed by element mapping in SEM and \n\nquantitative analysis in EMP (n=41) and XRD (n=20), with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-\n\nsericite-garnet schist as host rocks (Table 5). Chlorite is &lt;0.003 to 0.23 mm in size and has good \n\ncleavage. Chlorite occurs in two ways: (1) disseminated crystals in the matrix, the product of selective \n\nalteration of phyllosilicates, and (2) disseminated non-oriented aggregates in quartz-carbonate \n\nvenulations. Chlorite1 and Chlorite2 compositions are approximately the same (Fig. 8F), classified as \n\nRipidolite, according to the classification of Hey (1954): Fe/(Fe+Mg) (0.45-0.51; Avg 0.49) and Si28 \n\n(5.06-5.38; Avg 5.24). Quartz in the alteration haloes (10-60 vol%) as well as in the major quartz vein \n\nwas microstructurally analysed and is almost entirely recrystallized probably due to subgrain rotation \n\nand recrystallization during crystal-plastic deformation (Passchier and Trouw, 2005). \n\nGarnet in the alteration haloes (0-25 vol%) was analyzed by element mapping in SEM and \n\nquantitative analysis in EMP (n=139), with carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet \n\nschist as host rocks (Table 5). Garnet crystals have 0.016 to 4.5 mm in size and hipidiomorphic-\n\nidiomorphic shape.  They have a whitish to light pink color and are mainly zonated. The zonation is \n\nconcentric and marked by the inclusion of fine carbonaceous matter in the garnet core. Garnet crystals \n\nare commonly associated with a greater concentration of mafic minerals and often form aggregates \n\nwith ore minerals (ilmenite and chalcopyrite) and quartz inclusions. The carbonaceous matter mark the \n\nmargins of the garnet crystals, which are moderately to highly fractured, with rare fractures filled by \n\nchalcopyrite. Two types of garnet were interpreted: (1) zoned garnet with calcic margin and (2) garnet \n\nwithout zonation or with incipient zonation. Both are predominantly composed of almandine and have \n\na manganese core. The zoned garnet contains Alm 68,08-77,85 Grs 10,97-22,22 Pyp 3,47-8,01 Sps 0,93-11,38 Andr \n\n0,07-1,77 Uv 0,00-0,43 , a calcic margin, and a manganese core. The second type contains Alm 64,12-73,82 Grs \n\n16,88-22,78 Pyp 3,53-7,68 Sps 0,89-12,15 Andr 0,00-1,42 Uv 0,00-0,24 and a manganese core. Both have higher \n\nconcentrations of espessartite (Mn) in their cores and the Garnet1 show grossular and andradite \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \n\ncontribution (Ca) more significant in the margins (Fig. 8A-D). Garnet1 and Garnet2 are mostly \n\nmetamorphic and pre-kinematics, with rare rotated crystals, but the crystals containing ilmenite and \n\nchalcopyrite as aggregates and in fractures underwent later deformation and hydrothermal alteration. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n \n\nFig. 7.

G) Muscovite classification diagram. \n\nA rigorous analysis of the volume and component concentration changes in the altered rocks \n\n(Table 4) was performed using the best-fit isocon method (Grant, 1986). This method quantifies the \n\ngeochemical differences between altered and unaltered lithologies. When coupled with mineralogy it \n\nallows for the understanding of the migration of hydrothermal alteration along stratigraphy. Based on \n\ndrill core logging, petrography, and whole-rock geochemical analysis, samples were selected to define \n\nthe average composition of the least altered carbonaceous phyllite and quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet \n\nschist. These samples were collected in lenses within the metagraywacke sequence that were not \n\nsubjected to hydrothermal alteration. Al2O3 and or TiO2 were used as the least mobile elements to \n\ndefine the best-fit isocon, based on the average cluster of slopes for these elements. Selenium was used \n\nas the least mobile element for the carbonatic zone altered carbonaceous phyllite, specifically. The \n\nisocon is a reference line passing through the origin, which correspond to zero concentration change, \n\nin a plot of the least altered sample versus the most altered sample. Elements data should be analyzed \n\ncarefully due to hampering by the upper detection limit (As) and lower detection limit (SrO, Ge, Ag, \n\nCd, Mo, Hg and Sb). \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n\nThe results (wt% or ppm) for the carbonatic alteration zone of the carbonaceous phyllite (Fig. \n\n7E) indicates major gains in > 10% of CaO and MgO and major losses in > 100% of Ba, Cr, Zr, and \n\nSr, > 10% of Ni, Ce, Zr, V, Rb, SiO2, Li, La, Nd, Cu, As, Ga, Co, Y, Al2O3, and Nb, and  > 1% of \n\nPb, Sc, Th, Pr, Hf, Fe2O3, Sm, Gd, Dy, Cs, Na2O, Yb, U, Er, Sn, K2O, and W.

Abbreviations: CARB = carbonatic halo, GXN = carbonaceous \n\nphyllite, LA = least altered, PHY = phyllic halo, POT = potassic halo, GNCX = quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist, SIL = silicification \n\nhalo.  \n\nMajor gains in CaO and MgO, minor gains in MnO, and major losses in almost all other bulk \n\noxides in carbonatic zone GXN show the pervasive carbonate alteration over the carbonaceous \n\nphyllite. Minor to major gains in K2O in altered GXN and GNCX reflect phyllic (muscovite) and \n\npotassic (ferri-biotite) alteration of the least altered host rock. Al2O3 is immobile and therefore does \n\nnot manifest any notable change due to phyllic or potassic alteration. Major to minor losses and minor \n\ngains of SiO2 in altered GXN and GNCX reflect the relative increase in Fe2O3 due to sulfidation and \n\nCaO due to carbonate in quartz-carbonate hydrothermal veining and pods, compared to silicification \n\neffects. The least altered GXN and GNCX has a quartz-feldspatic matrix which masks the subsequent \n\nincrease in SiO2 content along hydrothermal alteration zones. Major to minor gains in CaO and MnO \n\nin the silification zone of GXN, and the phyllic and potassic zones of GNCX may reflect an increase \n\nin almandine garnet, with Ca-rich margins and Mn-rich cores. Overall LOI% increase in all altered \n\nGXN and GNCX compared to the least altered samples is related to an increase in micas (bound water \n\nOH+), carbonate minerals (CO2), and carbonaceous matter. Overall carbon increase in all altered \n\nGXN and GNCX compared to the least altered samples is related to an increase in carbonaceous \n\nmaterial contribution by the host rock and also related to pervasive carbonate mineral enrichment \n\n(carbonatic zone GXN) or quartz-carbonate hydrothermal veining. \n\nMajor gains of Ba in all altered GXN and GNCX may be related to millimeter to centimeter \n\nscale quartz-carbonate hydrothermal veins that contain barite. Major to minor gains in S and major \n\ngains in Cu in altered GXN (except carbonatic zone GXN) and GNCX reflect an increase in sulfide \n\nminerals: arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, ilmenite, magnetite, pentlandite, and pyrrhotite. Carbonatic, \n\nphyllic, potassic and silicification zones of GXN and potassic zones of GNCX show major gains in As \n\ndue to increase in Aspy content. Major to minor gains in Fe in potassic and silicification zones of \n\nGXN reflect an increase in sulfide minerals. Minor gains in TiO2 in silicification zones of GXN may \n\nbe related to a relative increase in ilmenite and rutile abundance. Major gains of As, Ni, and Co in \n\nsilicification zones of GXN may account for As-Ni-Co zonations within Aspy3. Spearman rank \n\ncorrelation matrix (Spearman, 1904) of gold with various elements revealed reasonable positive and \n\nnegative gold correlation values: Bi (0.71), LOI (0.69), Te (0.69), S (0.64), Se (0.61), W (0.6), Cr \n\n(0.57), Ga (0.56), CaO (0.54), P2O5 (0.52), TiO2 (0.52), V (0.51), SiO2 (-0.7) for GXN and W (0.75), \n\nSn (0.62), BaO (0.59), Ga (0.58), and Sb (0.52) for GNCX. Minor to major gains in Bi, Se, and Te in \n\nthe altered GXN samples, especially in the silicification zone of GXN, reflects the good positive \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n \n\ncorrelation between these elements and gold abundance. Major to minor gains in Ba, W, Ga, and Sn in \n\nthe potassic GNCX reflects the good positive correlation between these elements and gold abundance. \n\nThe least altered Ing\u00e1 carbonaceous phyllite and its different hydrothermal alteration haloes \n\nwere normalized to the following worldwide shale references: Average Mud from Queensland (MUQ \n\nby Kamber et al., 2005), North American Shale Composite (NASC by Haskin et al., 1968), Post \n\nArchean Australian Shale (PAAS by Taylor and McLennan, 1985), Average Shales (AS by Piper, \n\n1974), and European Shales (ES by Haskin and Haskin, 1966). This method allowed for geochemical \n\ncomparisons between different Ing\u00e1 carbonaceous phyllites and worldwide known shales. The \n\ncarbonate alteration zone of GXN is more depleted in REE than worldwide alteration zones and has a \n\ndifferent overall character, mainly in regard to major oxides, probably due to the influence of \n\ndolomite. The phyllic and potassic alteration zones are enriched in LREE in comparison with \n\nworldwide alteration zones, followed by the least altered GXN and then by the silicified GXN. The \n\npotassic alteration zone is enriched in HREE in comparison with the other alteration zones, followed \n\nby the silicification GXN and then the least altered and phyllic GXN. There is a positive europium \n\nanomaly for all carbonaceous phyllites. Compared to all reference shales cited, the Ing\u00e1 shales have \n\nstrong enrichment in MgO, CaO, Cr, Ba, and W and strong depletion in TiO2 and most REE. \n\nSamples of different gold grades were collected in the idiomorphic-arsenopyrite rich \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite and GNCX and compared in order to understand geochemical controls on gold \n\nin the sulfide rich host rock close to the major quartz vein and thrust fault. The high grade GXN was \n\ndefined as > 5g/t Au and the low to no grade GXN was defined as &lt;2 g/t Au. The high grade GNCX \n\nwas defined as > 1 g/t Au and the low to no grade GNCX was defined as &lt;1 g/t Au. These grades \n\nwere statistically defined considering all GXN and GNCX Ing\u00e1 drill core samples analysed for gold by \n\nfire assay by the geology and exploration department at the AngloGold Ashanti - Serra Grande Unit. \n\nHigh gold grade GXN samples are very enriched in Au, CaO, LOI, Sn, Sr, Bi, Se, Te, and S in \n\ncomparison to low or no gold grade samples. High gold grade GNCX samples are very enriched in \n\nAu, Ba, Tm, Ni, and S and very depleted in SiO2 in comparison to low to no gold grade samples. This \n\npossibly indicates that there is no direct relation between gold and overall arsenopyrite abundance, \n\nwith the exception of Arsenopyrite3 (explained in the next section). Binary and ternary plots with a \n\nvariety of elements and ratios were attempted in order to differentiate the high gold grade from the low \n\nto no gold grade in the host rocks. For the carbonaceous phyllite, the most informative plots are the Bi \n\nppm x Se pmm, S percent x Bi ppm, and S percent x P2O5 percent (Fig. 7A-B). For the GNCX the \n\nmost informative plots are the Ta ppm x W ppm and Ga ppm x W ppm (Fig. 7C-D). \n\nOre Mineralogy and Paragenesis \n\nWith regards to ore mineralogy, the paragenetic sequence is composed of Pyrrhotite \u00b1 \n\nPentlandite \u00b1 Arsenopyrite1 (Stage 1), Arsenopyrite2 (Stage II), Arsenopyrite3 \u00b1 Pyrrothite \u00b1 \n\nChalcopyrite \u00b1 Ilmenite \u00b1 Rutile \u00b1 Magnetite \u00b1 Pentlandite \u00b1 visible Au (Stage III). The pyrrhotite \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n \n\n(Stages I and III) has allotriomorphic intrafoliar shape oriented along S2 foliation. Pyrrhotite is&lt;0.003 \n\nto 1.32 mm in size, with abundances varying from &lt;1% to 8%. Pyrrothite (Po) commonly occurs as \n\ninclusions, filling fractures, or along Aspy3 margins. Po rarely occurs as inclusions in garnet, where it \n\nfills fractures or marks crystal margins. Po commonly presents chalcopyrite and rarely presents \n\nilmenite along crystal margins and as inclusions. Magnetite inclusions and pentlandite flames \n\ncommonly occur in Po. \n\nIlmenite is oriented along S2 foliation, has an idiomorphic rod shape, and is commonly \n\ndisseminated as free crystals that are&lt;0.003 to 0.173 mm in size, with abundances varying from &lt;1% \n\nto 2%. Ilmenite rarely occurs as inclusions or along the margins of pyrrhotite (Stages I and III) and as \n\ninclusions in zoned garnet and Aspy2 and Aspy3. Rarely contain magnetite inclusions. Rarely present \n\npartial alteration to rutile. The chalcopyrite has allotriomorphic shape and is randomly oriented. It is &lt;\n\n0.003 to 0.233 mm in size, with abundances varying from &lt;1% to 1%. It occurs along crystal margins \n\nand as inclusions in pyrrhotite (Stages I and III) and in margins, filling fractures and as inclusions in \n\nAspy2 and Aspy3. Rarely occurs as free crystals, along ilmenite margins, in association with rutile, in \n\nhornblende fractures, or as inclusions in zoned garnet and in zoned garnet fractures. \n\nThe rutile is randomly oriented, has an idiomorphic shape, and is 0.1 to 3 mm in size, with \n\nabundances varying from&lt;1% to 1%. Rutile occurs as free crystals in quartz-carbonate venulations \n\nassociated with Aspy2, Aspy3, and visible gold. Where altered from ilmenite, it has allotriomorphic \n\nshape and sub-millimeter size with an abundance of &lt;1%. Magnetite occurs as sub-millimeter \n\nrounded inclusions in Aspy2 and Aspy3, Po (Stages I and III), and ilmenite crystals, with an \n\nabundance of &lt;1%. Pentlandite occurs as sub-millimeter irregular flames in pyrrhotite crystals (Stages \n\nI and III), with abundance of &lt;1%. \n\nVisible gold is randomly oriented, has an allotriomorphic shape, and is > 0.001 to 0.825 mm in \n\nsize. It occurs in the mineralized zone mainly as free crystals in the basal level of the major quartz vein \n\n(Fig. 5G). In the carbonaceous phyllite, visible gold occurs mainly in the VQZ hanging-wall and rarely \n\nin the footwall. Gold occurs as free crystals in the matrix near the contact with biotite, sericite and \n\ncarbonaceous matter (Fig. 5H) and rarely on rutile and pyrrhotite (Stage III) margins (Fig. 5K and 5L). \n\nVisible gold commonly occurs as inclusions, filling fractures or in margins of Aspy3 in the \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite (Fig. 5I and 5J). Visible gold rarely occurs as free crystals in the GNCX in the \n\nfootwall of the VQZ or as inclusions, filling fractures or in margins of Aspy3 associated with \n\nsecondary quartz veins that crosscut GXN and GNCX. \n\nArsenopyrite Characterization \n\n Three main arsenopyrite types have been defined at Ing\u00e1 orebody in paragenetic sequence \n\nfrom arsenopyrite 1 (Aspy1) to arsenopyrite 3 (Apsy3): \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n\nAspy1 occurs in the carbonaceous phyllite and GNCX, oriented along S2 foliation. It has \n\nallotriomorphic shape, is porous, and is 0.004 m to 19 mm in size. Aspy1 is commonly associated with \n\nsymmetric to asymmetric strain shadows. Aspy1 is rarely associated with pyrrothite (Stage I) margins. \n\nNo SEM, EMP, and LA-ICP-MS analysis were done in this type of arsenopyrite for the present work \n\nbecause its zones of occurrence have no relevant grade. Further studies shall consider the \n\ngeochemistry of Aspy1 for comparison with Aspy2 and Aspy3. \n\nAspy2 and Aspy3 (Fig 9A-J) occur until three meters adjacent to VQZ, crosscutting the \n\nsilicification halo of the carbonaceous phyllite, and until within one meter of secondary quartz veins, \n\ncrosscutting GXN and GNCX. In gallery scale the Aspy2 and Aspy3 were only observed in the host \n\nrock in the hanging-wall of the major quartz vein. It is impossible to separate both by naked eye, so \n\nmicroanalysis is necessary (i.e. SEM, EMP, LA-ICP-MS). It is randomly oriented, has a zonated \n\nidiomorphic shape, and is 15 mm to 5 cm in size. Cruciform twins are common. It is associated with \n\npyrrothite (Stage III) and chalcopyrite on or near margins, in fractures, or as inclusions. Magnetite \n\n(common) and ilmenite (rare) occur as inclusions. It is rarely associated with rutile. Amorphous \n\nankerite rarely occurs in Aspy2 and Aspy3 fractures and margins. The differences between Aspy2 and \n\nAspy3 include textures and chemical zonation. Aspy2 makes up the core of the idiomorphic Aspy \n\ncrystal and is richer in S. Aspy3 occurs along the margins and fractures of Aspy2 crystals, forming \n\nirregular inclusion-rich margins with a sieve texture. Aspy3 presents higher concentrations of As-Ni-\n\nCo than Aspy2, with random Ni-Co zonations as attested by EMP (Fig. 9G-H). Visible gold \n\nconcentrates only in Aspy3, along its margins, fractures (two sets), or as inclusions (Fig. 5I and 5J, \n\nFig. 8I). Table 6A shows that Aspy2 (n=65) is EMP geochemically characterized by wt% S (19.02-\n\n22.98; Avg 21.29), As (42.18-46.63; Avg 44.26), Ni (0.05-0.62; Avg 0.17), Co (0.03-0.78; Avg 0.11), \n\nand Fe (32.61-35.24 wt%; Avg 34.56). Aspy3 (n=48) is EMP geochemically characterized by wt% S \n\n(18.7-20.73; Avg 19.62), As (45.41-47.47; Avg 46.47), Ni (0.05-3.97; Avg 0.51), Co (0.02-0.48; Avg \n\n0.17), and Fe (29.76-34.78; Avg 33.52). Two arsenopyrite types have been reported by Fortes (1996) \n\nin the Mina III orebody at the same stratigraphic level, after observations in SEM of S and As \n\ngeochemistry, which approximately correspond to Aspy2 and Aspy3 of the present paper. \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\n \n\nLA-ICP-MS spot analysis and element mapping were performed on Aspy2 and Aspy3 with a \n\nfocus on their cores, margins, and fractures. Spatial decoupling between elements reflects, in part, \n\ngeochemically distinct arsenopyrite domains. Table 6B show that, overall, Aspy2 has (median) > 100 \n\nppm of Fe, S, As, Ni, Co, Te, and Zn, > 10 ppm of Cu, Sb, and Se, > 1 ppm of Cr, V, and Pb, and &lt;1 \n\nppm of Mo, Re, Au, Bi, Sn, W, and Cd, while Aspy3 has overall > 100 ppm of Fe, As, S, Ni, Co, Se, \n\nand Te, > 10 ppm of Sb, Zn, Cr, and Bi, > 1 ppm of Pb, V, Cu, and Sn, and &lt;1 ppm of Au, W, Re, Cd, \n\nand Mo. Elements Pd and Ag all had analysis below the detection limit, Pr and In had only two \n\nanalyses above the detection limit and Au, Bi, Mo, Cd, W, and Sn had significant data below the \n\ndetection limit. Table 6B compares the median and geometric mean trace element concentrations of \n\nAspy3 compared to Aspy2. Aspy3 has > 200% positive change (median) of Bi, Pb, As, Se, Cr, Cd, Sn, \n\nand V, > 100% of W and Ni, > 30% of Au, Sb, Co, and Fe and &lt;10-100% negative change (median) \n\nof Cu, S, Mo, Zn, Re, and Te compared to Aspy2. Box plot analysis (Fig. 10) show marked low S, Cu, \n\nand Mo concentrations and marked high As, Cr, Bi, Se, Co, Ni, Pb, V, and Sn concentrations in Aspy3 \n\ncompared to Aspy2. Probability plots, split probability plots, scaled coordinates (minimum zero to \n\nmaximum one), and spider plot (Aspy3 compared to Aspy2), indicate relative high concentrations of \n\nAs, Bi, Cr, Se, Ni, and Sn in Aspy3 compared to Aspy2 and relative high concentrations of S, Cu, and \n\nMo in Aspy2 compared to Aspy3. \n\n \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 9.

Abbreviations: Aspy = \n\narsenopyrite, Au = gold. \n\nArsenium, bulk element for Aspy3 recognition in margins and fracture zones, show marked \n\npositive Pearson correlation with Se, Ni, Fe, Cr, Sb, Co, Bi, Te, Sn, and V. Elements As, Fe, Co, and \n\nNi show a similar behavior, as detected by the EMP analysis. Sulfur, bulk element for Aspy2 \n\nrecognition in core zones, shows marked positive Pearson correlation with Cu, Re, W, Mo, Zn, and \n\nCd. Aspy2 is then relatively depleted in most trace elements and base metals, while Aspy3 is relatively \n\nenriched uniformly in some and erratic in others, showing systematic variations in selected trace \n\nelements. This variability may indicate that these elements occur, at least in part, as nanoparticles. Due \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n\nto its nugget effect, both Aspy2 and Aspy3 show weak positive Pearson correlation gold values, with \n\nAspy3 values (<0.5 \u2013 2.18 ppm) 43% higher than Aspy2 values (<0.5 \u2013 2.31 ppm). Of the nine spot \n\nanalyses in Aspy2, four (44%) have gold concentrations above the detection limit (> 0.5 ppm), \n\nshowing that invisible gold could exist as submicroscopic particles or could be present  non-uniformly \n\nas a solid solution within the host arsenopyrite lattice. Aspy crystals possess then a complex reworking \n\nstory characterized by variable precious and base metal enrichment. Outliers concentrations observed \n\nin the data and the box plot analyses indicate the presence of micro-inclusions in the host arsenopyrite \n\ncontaining Pb (galena), Zn (sphalerite), Cu (chalcopyrite), S (sulfides), V, Cd, Te, Mo, and Sn. \n\nCadmium shows a strong relationship with Zn in PCA plot analysis (PC3, 2.8 eigenvalue, 0.66 scaled \n\ncoordinates), indicating possible high Cd content in sphalerite micro-inclusions as described by Berner \n\net al. (2013). Tellurim could be related to the presence of Au-Bi-Mo telluride micro-inclusions. \n\nElement mapping was done on three arsenopyrite crystals of thin section 55-16. Figure 11 shows an \n\nexample from Aspy3, which has marked high concentrations of Au, Ag, Bi, and Ni and slightly \n\nmarked high concentrations of Pb, Co, Te, Se, and Re, while Aspy2 shows marked high concentrations \n\nof Mo and Sb and slightly marked high concentrations of Zn and W. There are two distinct fracture \n\nsets in arsenopyrite, in which a later, more developed set crosscut a previous, less developed set. Both \n\nare gold rich and contain the same elemental assemblage as Aspy3, making it impossible to identify \n\nany difference regarding mineralogy and geochemistry. There are elevated concentrations of trace \n\nelements in the fractures (Aspy3) compared to the inclusion-free undeformed arsenopyrite zones \n\n(Aspy2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 10.

Archean basins, once formed, represent zones of long-lived structural \n\nweakness and remain favorable settings for gold mineralization and/or remobilization during \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\n \n\nsubsequent reworking (Lawley et al., 2015). Gold, if present within Aspy, is often heterogeneously \n\ndistributed within compositionally zoned grains (Morey et al., 2008). Gold poor cores and enrichment \n\nalong growth zones toward grain margins were documented by Johan et al. (1989), Fleet et al. (1989), \n\nMumin et al. (1994), Oberthur et al. (1997), Fleet and Mumin (1997), Genkin et al. (1998), and Cook \n\net al. (2013). Gold redistribution by remobilization from the sulfide lattice and reconcentration (as \n\ninclusions of gold or electrum) within or near the parent mineral is recognized as an important process \n\n(e.g., Larocque et al., 1995). Remobilization may be recognized in gold ores, which have developed \n\nduring a sequence of fluid inputs and prolonged fluid infiltration at temperatures consistent with \n\ngreenschist facies metamorphism or above or below, generally under oriented strain (Cook et al., \n\n2013). Oscillatory zoning with respect to the essential elements (Fe, As, and S) and with respect to Co \n\nand Ni, common minor constituents in arsenopyrite, has been previously reported (Cathelineau et al., \n\n1989; Morey et al., 2008, Cook et al., 2013). \n\nThe Aspy2 and Aspy3 crystals are concentrated within the selvages of the major quartz vein, \n\nshowing its late hydrothermal character, in comparison to the early Aspy1 that is wrapped by the S2 \n\nfoliation commonly showing strain shadows. In gallery scale, only the major quartz vein hanging-wall \n\ncontains carbonaceous phyllite rich in Aspy2 and Aspy3. Gold-rich Aspy3 concentrated on late \n\narsenopyrite crystal fractures and inclusion-rich sieve-textured boundaries are in contrast with gold-\n\npoor Aspy2 concentrated in the arsenopyrite interior. This contrast is possibly related to post \n\ncrystallization gold enrichment along late crystal fractures and selective alteration toward the margins, \n\nforming Aspy3. This post crystallization fluid-assisted remobilization of precious and base metals \n\npossibly occurred during successive deformation events (Tomkins and Mavrogenes, 2001; Wagner et \n\nal., 2007; Morey et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2011; Cook et al., 2013; Lawley et al., 2015; Fougerouse \n\net al., 2017; Gourcerol et al., 2018). Inclusion-rich sieve-textured Aspy3 domains and fracture \n\nnetworks are possibly enriched in precious and base metals and contain clusters of native gold, \n\npyrrothite (Stage III), chalcopyrite, magnetite, and ilmenite inclusions. Geochemically anomalous \n\ndomains are demarcated by trails of mineral inclusions and/or embayed crystal boundaries. These \n\ntextures suggest that Aspy2 and Aspy3 crystals possess complex reworking histories characterized by \n\nvariable precious and base metal enrichment. This grain boundary-fracture association suggests an \n\nexternal influence and given the lack of other mineral phases containing arsenium and sulphur, \n\nintroduction of a late hydrothermal fluid is thought to be responsible for this association (Morey et al., \n\n2008). This fluid would penetrate along grain borders, possibly promoting fracturing and facilitating \n\nreaction progress. The resulting Aspy3 rims are thus considered to be alteration rims. \n\nZoning patterns and intermediate compositions between Aspy2 and Aspy3 suggests constant \n\nchanges in fluid pressure and fluid flow regime. The intermediate compositions are attested by the \n\ngray shading in BSE imaging in SEM and EMP. This gray shading has previously been attributed to \n\nAspy growth zoning and the substitution of As for S within Aspy crystals in response to changing \n\nconditions, as attested by experimental studies (Kretschmar and Scott, 1976; Sharp et al., 1985; \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n \n\nCarpenter, 2003; Lawley et al., 2015). Typical Aspy2 and Aspy3 are the end members of intermediate \n\ncompositions. Progressive mineral precipitation during wall-rock alteration by hydrothermal fluid \n\nwould result in a gradual compositional change of precipitating minerals. These observations support a \n\nmodel for Au distribution in Ing\u00e1 arsenopyrite involving possible grain-scale remobilization during \n\ndeformation and subsequent Au reconcentration at or close to grain margins and within intragranular \n\nmicrofractures. Possibly remobilized gold must have originally been incorporated within sulfides and \n\nwas later released, rather than being supplied at the time of brittle-ductile fracture. Release of gold \n\npossibly took place in response to deformation. Some remobilization of gold from sulfides to free gold \n\naccumulations might occur during F2 folding in the Crix\u00e1s greenstone belt (S. Ulrich, pers. commun., \n\n2014). Such a major event in its late brittle-ductile stages was probably responsible for the possible \n\nremobilization of an inferred invisible gold from Aspy2 to form visible gold in Aspy3. \n\nIt can be difficult to resolve the timing of gold incorporation in sulfides of the Ing\u00e1 with a \n\nsingle orogenic gold deposit model, because superimposed, later stages of deformation cause Au to be \n\nreleased from arsenian pyrite or arsenopyrite (Large et al., 2011). Gold was released either into the ore \n\nfluid or, more likely, was concentrated at or close to grain boundaries. Sulfide crystallization could \n\nhave occurred before veining and the main phase of Au deposition, during the same stage but later, or \n\nafter vein formation. Sulfides may also have been formed throughout (i.e., at multiple different stages) \n\nthe mineralization event. The variation in grain size, morphology and geochemistry of arsenopyrite \n\ncrystals at Ing\u00e1 indicates at least three stages of arsenopyrite deposition: Aspy1 (early hydrothermal), \n\nAspy2 (late hydrothermal) and Aspy3 (later hydrothermal-remobilization). Considering that \n\nhydrothermal sulfides occur at the margin of reworked veins and also disseminated in wall rock, it is \n\nmost likely that they formed at the end of a mineralization event after the fluid became supersaturated \n\nand precipitated the majority of gold. Fluids were, nevertheless, Au-bearing at the time of sulfide \n\nformation and available Au was scavenged by, and possibly preferentially partitioned into Aspy2. \n\nSubsequent deformation possibly released Au, giving rise to a population of visible gold grains in the \n\nsulfides and adjacent areas, contributing to the overall Au budget. The observed Au enrichment toward \n\nthe grain margins and, critically, the presence of nano to micro-pores in the same parts of the grain, \n\nindicate that Au release could have been assisted by late percolating fluids via reactions between \n\npreexisting arsenopyrite, leading to partial dissolution. This reinforces the idea that Au release is \n\nactivated by infiltration under deformation (Pokrovski et al., 2002; Cook et al., 2009; Sung et al., \n\n2009; Ciobanu et al., 2012) and not solid state diffusion as explained by Tomkins and Mavrogenes \n\n(2002). In the Ing\u00e1 orebody, fluid infiltration along fractures was probably critical for Au \n\nremobilization. \n\nThere is a general consensus that indicates a positive correlation between Au and As in \n\narsenian pyrite (Cook and Chrysssoulis, 1990; Simon et al., 1999b; Large et al., 2009), which may be \n\napplied to arsenopyrite. As and Co composition show an inverse relation with Fe, indicating the \n\nreplacement of Fe by Co in the Aspy structure. A number of studies show that Au in solid solution \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n \n\nexchanges for Fe sites within arsenopyrite and pyrite (Wu and Delbove, 1989; Fleet and Mumin, 1997; \n\nTarnocai et al., 1997), promoting an inverse correlation. Aspy EMP and LA-ICP-MS element maps \n\nand spot analyses reported herein provide possible evidence for relatively late gold enrichment that is, \n\nin part, linked to the post crystallization history of early sulfides. Fluid assisted and/or deformation \n\ndriven sulfide dissolution likely mobilized these elements from older sulfide minerals. Recrystallized \n\narsenopyrite domains (i.e. sieve-textured crystal boundary Aspy and domains adjacent to fractures) are \n\nenriched in precious and base metals as attested by LA-ICP-MS analysis on Aspy3. Trace elements in \n\narsenopyrite occurs as (1) lattice substitution (i.e. in solid solution) or (2) inclusions of nanoparticles \n\nor visible inclusions (Huston et al., 1995; Deditius et al., 2011). The presence of As in arsenopyrite, in \n\nsubstitution for As in the S site, distorts the arsenopyrite lattice, making it easier for large cations (i.e. \n\nAu, Pb, Bi) to be incorporated into the arsenopyrite, and at higher concentrations, these elements are \n\nincorporated in micro-inclusions of Bi-Pb-Au that contain tellurides, selenides, or galena enriched in \n\nBi, Au, Se, and Te or Au-Sb-Te phases (Gregory et al., 2016). These micro-inclusions occur at low-\n\nstrain micro-textural sites and/or are present as clusters. Mineral inclusion clusters (e.g., sieve-textured \n\nAspy) and variably replaced early sulfide phases are microtextures typical of metamorphosed deposits \n\n(Tomkins and Mavrogenes, 2001 and Lawley et al., 2015). We interpret that the two distinct set of \n\nfractures observed, with the same geochemical and mineralogical assemblage, actually belong to one \n\nconjugated fracture set, with the same importance regarding gold remobilization and mineralization, \n\nboth considered Aspy3 zones. Our observations are consistent with and complement those of Morey et \n\nal. (2008) and Cook et al. (2013), who also considered textural and grain-scale geochemical evidence \n\nin arsenopyrite for cycles of hydrothermal infiltration, alteration, and remobilization during evolution \n\nof a gold ore. Two combined processes could explain the overall lower trace element content of Aspy2 \n\ncompared to Aspy3: (1) trace elements were depleted in the early hydrothermal fluids compared to the \n\nevolved, (2) trace elements were present in the early fluids but incorporated into other minerals (such \n\nas chalcopyrite or pyrrhotite) or formed accessory phases (e.g. such as Au tellurides, As-bearing \n\nminerals). \n\nAylmore and Graham (1992) concluded that a high percentage of the gold occurs either as fine \n\ninclusions or is located in a lattice defect or interstitial site of arsenopyrite. Previous studies concluded \n\nthat invisible gold can occur in solid solution within the host crystal lattice or exist as &lt;1 ?m, \n\nsubmicroscopic particles (Cabri et al., 1989; Cabri et al., 2000; Genkin et al., 1998; Simon et al., \n\n1999a; Palenik et al., 2004; Morey et al., 2008). In ores subjected to deformation and/or hydrothermal \n\nalteration after formation, the greater part of the invisible gold incorporated in sulfides at the time of \n\ninitial precipitation, if any, will be expelled from the sulfide lattice (e.g. Mumin et al., 1994; Large et \n\nal., 2007, 2009, Cook et al., 2013). The chemical state of gold in solid solution is complex, with \n\nstudies suggesting an oxidation state of Au3+ (e.g., Arehart et al., 1993) or a combination of Au0 and \n\nAu1+ (e.g., Simon et al., 1999a and Cabri et al., 2000). Thus the speciation of gold in arsenopyrite is \n\nnot well understood, in spite of intense studies over the last years (Cabri et al., 2000). In orogenic \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n \n\nsystems, gold commonly has a bimodal distribution in which invisible gold within arsenopyrite is \n\noverprinted by later visible gold (Coleman, 1957; Mumin et al., 1994; Oberth\u00fcr et al., 1997; Genkin et \n\nal., 1998). The formation of visible gold in Aspy3 is thought to be related to the post-crystallization \n\nfracturing and alteration. It is suggested that the submicron lattice bound gold that was probably \n\nexsolved from the Aspy2 crystal structure during renewed F2 folding, was then remobilized along \n\nsecondary fractures and crystal margins characterized by the Aspy3 domain (Morey et al., 2008 and \n\nSayab et al., 2016). The no to low gold grade contents of some idiomorphic arsenopyrite-rich \n\ncarbonaceous phyllites close to the major quartz vein (e.g. drill hole II-485) is probably related to \n\nweak development of Aspy3 due to locally weak post crystallization remobilization and alteration \n\nduring D2 deformation and overprint. \n\nIt is unknown whether an increase in sulfur fugacity (fS2) alone can cause exsolution of \n\npossible invisible gold from arsenopyrite. An overall increase in temperature and sulfur fugacity (fS2) \n\ndue to increase in the amount of S within the hydrothermal phase occurred. The excess S produced by \n\nthe formation of As-rich alteration rims was responsible for this increase. These relationships are \n\nconsistent with the observed gold-arsenopyrite textures and the notion that the solubility of gold in \n\narsenopyrite decreases with increasing temperature (Barton, 1969; Kretschmar and Scott, 1976; Sharp \n\net al., 1985). The observed gold-arsenopyrite relationships are best explained by a continuously \n\nevolving hydrothermal system, which is expected to preserve gradual changes in mineral chemistry. \n\nFurthermore, the higher-temperature event responsible for the Aspy3 rims may have involved only \n\nlow fluid influx: complete alteration of the Aspy2 grains is more likely during a pervasive high fluid \n\nflux event. The lack of major arsenopyrite dissolution suggests that fO2 changes likely played a \n\nminimal role during arsenopyrite alteration (Heinrich and Eadington, 1986, Morey et al., 2008). If this \n\nsecondary hot fluid was significantly undersaturated in gold, it would have possibly removed inferred \n\ninvisible gold as it replaced the Aspy2. However, since abundant visible gold may have been formed \n\nduring this stage, this secondary fluid was likely close to saturation and also could have deposited new \n\nmetal. Fortes (1996) observations in Mina III, that indicate that gold is related to late Aspy3 phases, \n\ncould therefore be correct, in part. \n\nProposed formation model \n\nThe Ing\u00e1 orebody formed during successive events of deformation, metamorphism and \n\nhydrothermal alteration. The tholeiitic spills overloaded over the komatiitic spills formed a shallow \n\nflexural basin with deposition of pelitic-psamitic to chemical sediments when the stratigraphic \n\nsequence of the Ing\u00e1 orebody was deposited, including: dolomites, carbonaceous phyllite and pelites. \n\nOver the carbonaceous phyllites and pelites the graywacke was deposited, indicating an increase in \n\nsedimentary load (Fig. 12A). The primary features and the petrographic and geochemical properties of \n\nthe graywackes (Jost et al., 1996) suggest that their clastic load derived from a source area that \n\ncontained felsic to intermediate igneous and metamorphic rocks that were deposited by turbidity \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n \n\ncurrents with increasing energy towards the top (Jost et al., 2010). During the deposition of the \n\nsediments, forming S0, a distensive event simultaneously occurred, which thickened the graywacke \n\nlayers and thinned the volcanic strata. This is evidenced by syn-depositional low angle normal faults. \n\nThis sedimentary basin evolution is correlated to a shallow sea platform environment with proximity \n\nto the continental coast (A.J. Massucatto, pers. Commun., 2004). S0 in Ing\u00e1 is not locally visible, \n\nneither in gallery, nor in drill holes, due to the proximity of the orebody to the thrust fault III, where \n\nS1 locally transpose S0 at a low angle. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 12.

Abbreviations: Aspy = arsenopyrite, Au = gold, DOL = dolomite, GNCX = quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist, GXN = \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite, MBA = metabasalt, MG = metagraywacke, KO = komatiite, VQZ = major quartz vein. \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n \n\nThe prograde metamorphic path is characterized by the greenschist facies garnet zone, \n\nforming the pre-hydrothermal assemblages of the Ing\u00e1 orebody. During the prograde metamorphic \n\npath, isoclinal folding (F1) of bedding and early quartz veins occurred, developing dominant \n\nmetamorphic schistosity S1 that reoriented crystals. The regional structure of the D1 thrust and thrust \n\nramps suggests that the orebodies lie within an early, regional E-W to NNW-oriented basement-basin \n\nfault bend. This zone would have acted as an early zone of maximum extension during basin \n\ndevelopment with focusing of basin fluids into this area. This pre-dates mineralization, but may have \n\nset the architecture for later deep-seated fluid conduits. These block faults would allow enhanced \n\nupward migration of fluids into the thrust stack, as well as along thrust structures (T. Coughlin, \n\npers. Commun., 2002). Fortes (1996) suggests the metasediments as the gold source for the \n\nhydrothermal fluids. During the retrograde metamorphic path, S1 reactivation and posterior \n\nsulphidation-mineralization occurred. Fluids migrated along S0 parallel to S1, facilitated by the low \n\nangle thrust fault III and related strain zones that acted as conduits allowing hydrothermal fluids \n\npercolation. Sulfide mineralization was then developed pre F2 folding, very likely during the \n\nreactivation of S1 schistosity at early stages of exhumation along the retrograde metamorphic path.  \n\nHydrothermal alteration of the peak metamorphic assemblage occurred mainly outwards from \n\nthe low angle thrust fault III along S0 parallel to S1, forming the silicification, potassic, phyllic and \n\ncarbonatic haloes within the carbonaceous phyllite and the potassic and phyllic haloes within the \n\nGNCX. The newly formed hydrothermal minerals (e.g. biotite and sericite) mimetize the S1 foliation. \n\nPossibly gold-poor Aspy1 was formed during the initial stages of hydrothermal alteration and is \n\nwrapped by the S1 foliation that was reactivated, also forming strain shadows. Possibly randomly \n\noriented, invisible gold-rich Aspy2 (Fig. 12C) formed during the late stages of D1, accounting for part \n\nof the gold budget, occurring in the carbonaceous phyllite close to the low angle thrust fault III and \n\nrelated strain zones, under high fluid-flux conditions. The carbonaceous phyllite and its reduced \n\ncharacteristics acted as a chemical buffer for sulfide precipitation.  \n\nDuring the late stages of D1, building of crack and seal veins (e.g. major quartz vein) parallel \n\nto S1 occurred during S1 reactivation, from fluid percolation due to permeability anisotropy within the \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite. The major quartz vein tends to be emplaced following the floor thrust of the \n\nthrust fault III, which sits close to the contact of the carbonaceous phyllite with the GNCX, but may \n\nalso follow weak zones within the host rock due to hydraulic fracturing, sometimes distant from this \n\ncontact. Hydraulic fracturing is attested by deformed arsenopyrite-rich carbonaceous phyllite \n\nfragments in VQZ interior. Later folding of S1 with NW plunging F2 fold axes and strong NW-SE L2 \n\nstretching, also forming boudinage, affected the VQZ. The VQZ core is, in general, massive, but \n\nincreasingly sheared towards the walls, which indicates that it formed under extension, synchronously \n\nwith penetrative fabrics in the host rock. These fabrics were later overprinted by continued shear zone \n\nmovement (Platt, 1983) or from shear zone reactivation, part of subsequent generations of \n\ndeformation. The competency difference between the major quartz vein and the carbonaceous phyllite, \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \n\nindicates that the quartz vein concentrates stress, increasing the deformation magnitude in its \n\nsurroundings, allowing an increase in the carbonaceous phyllite folding, originating strain features in \n\ncontact with the VQZ. \n\nThe common distribution of Au mineralization along the base of D1 quartz veins suggests that \n\npart of Au mineralization post-dated the quartz veins, and was commonly deposited by damming of \n\nmineralizing fluids during upward migration (L.R. Rankin, pers. Commun., 2004). Aspy2 and Aspy3 \n\ninside the carbonaceous phyllite fragments could indicate pre-vein sulfide formation. The gold-rich \n\nfluids migrated upwards, mainly through the thrust fault III and related shear zones and precipitated \n\nthe gold in the present Aspy2 and Aspy3-rich hanging-wall carbonaceous phyllite and in the basal \n\nlevel of the major quartz vein by damming, rarely passing through this basal level to the present \n\nfootwall host rocks (pre D2 stratigraphic overturning). \n\nThe D2 event is responsible for the stratigraphic overturning of the sequence (Fig. 12B), as \n\nevidenced by the common facing-down of volcanic and sedimentary primary structures and by the \n\noverriding of the metakomatiites onto the metabasalts, which in turn overrides the metasedimentary \n\nsection (Jost et al., 2010). This D2 stratigraphic overturning formed the present configuration of the \n\nIng\u00e1 orebody stratigraphy. Later folding of S1 and S1 parallel to mineralization with NW plunging F2 \n\nfold axes and strong L2 stretching occurred. NW-SE stretching and boudinage and N-S trending veins \n\nalso formed. The F2 folding over the major quartz vein and host rocks possibly reconcentrated the \n\ngold parallel to F2 axis, locally increasing gold grades. F2 folding locally controls the Ing\u00e1 ore shoot \n\ngeometry along with NW-SE stretching, forming the Ing\u00e1 orebody orientation that varies between \n\n260-315\u00ba trend and 20-57\u00ba plunge. There is a natural variability in F2 fold axis distribution due to \n\nstrain heterogeneity or refraction due to F2 folding. During D2, a plane-axial cleavage (S2) was \n\ngenerated by pressure dissolution, causing the transposition of S0 and/or S1 and reorientation of \n\nminerals, mainly phyllosilicates.  \n\nPossible remobilization of inferred invisible gold in Aspy2 to form visible gold in Aspy3 \n\nalong late crystal fractures and selective alteration toward the margins occurred because of F2 folding, \n\nsubstantially increasing the orebody gold budget under low fluid-flux conditions (Fig. 12D and 12E). \n\nPossible remobilization of inferred invisible gold from Aspy2 to the major quartz vein and host rock \n\ngangue occurred as a consequence of F2 folding, as well as the possible new deposition of visible gold \n\nduring subsequent mineralization events, forming visible gold concentrated in the base of the major \n\nquartz vein and disseminated in the carbonaceous phyllite gangue, mainly in the hanging-wall. The \n\nweak competency of the quartz vein in relation to F2 folding, causes disruptions in the folded zones, \n\ngenerating E-W accommodation faults. Small brittle-ductile strain zones developed in the planes of \n\nthese accommodation faults and released the gold from the quartz vein, allowing gold concentration in \n\nthe gangue of the adjacent carbonaceous phyllite, mainly in the hanging-wall. The F2 folding over the \n\nmajor quartz vein more greatly affected its basal contact in relation to post D2 overturning. This basal \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n \n\ncontact is highly folded compared to its upper contact. S2 foliation is also more penetrative in the \n\ncarbonaceous phyllite in the footwall of the major quartz vein. Gold mineralization therefore pre-dates \n\nD2, and is likely D1 or post D1, but has been significantly remobilized and enriched by F2 folding of \n\nD1 veins and host rock. D3 N-S compression generates the crenulation cleavage S3, which was \n\nidentified only in drill holes at Ing\u00e1. The S3 crenulation cleavage partially rotates the F2 axis, \n\nproducing microfolds that reorient mainly phyllosilicates. Apparently D3 did not affect the gold \n\nmineralization in the Ing\u00e1 orebody, there is no evidence for gold related remobilization in the \n\narea/samples studied. The D4 event was not recognized at the Ing\u00e1 orebody. \n\nThe lack of structural evidence for deformation events that predate D1 in both the volcanic \n\nand sedimentary sections leads to the conclusion that D1 and D2 events occurred during the \n\nPaleoproterozoic (Rhyacian) 2170 \u00b1 17 Ma (Jost et al., 2010). Hydrothermal fluids passing through \n\nthe hanging-wall of the Ing\u00e1 orebody, along S0 parallel to S1 in the dolomite sequence, leached and \n\ncarried C, CaO, MgO, and MnO from the dolomites, whose subsequent precipitation pervasively \n\naltered the carbonaceous phyllite, originating the carbonatic alteration halo. This is confirmed by the \n\nmajor gains of C, CaO, MgO, and MnO and major losses in almost all other bulk oxides in the \n\ncarbonatic zone of the carbonaceous phyllite. The diffuse contact between the dolomite sequence and \n\nthe carbonaceous phyllite also provides strong evidence for this hydrothermal alteration event. This \n\npervasive carbonatic alteration suggests a fluid of relative low temperature and alkaline pH due to the \n\nstability of carbonates. \n\nThe selective phyllic halo occurs adjacent to the carbonatic zone. The halo originated from \n\nfluids with low to moderate temperatures and acidic character, with the potential to leach the host rock \n\n(Pirajno, 2009). Alteration substituted feldspars, micas, and mafic minerals to form phengitic \n\nmuscovite and sericite along S1 foliation, sometimes forming locally massive concentrations. The \n\nferri-biotite which characterizes the pervasive-selective potassic alteration always occurs over the \n\nphengitic muscovite in textural relations. Its occurrence is normally related to macroscopically gray-\n\nyellow levels abruptly crosscutting the host rock. These level contacts are rarely diffuse. The potassic \n\nalteration, that occurs adjacent to the silicification halo, promoted the gain in K2O in the rock and loss \n\nof Fe and Mg from mafic minerals, assisted by fluids that usually have neutral to alkaline pH and \n\nelevated temperatures (Pirajno, 2009). Minor to major gains in K2O in altered GXN and GNCX \n\nreflect phyllic (phengitic muscovite and sericite) and potassic (ferri-biotite) alteration over the least \n\naltered host rock. \n\nSilicification, in particular, occurred during many events of fluid influx into the carbonaceous \n\nphyllite, from pre phyllic alteration to post-potassic alteration. However, a main post-potassic \n\nalteration event accounts for the bulk of silicification of the carbonaceous phyllite silicification halo. \n\nThe least altered GXN and GNCX have a quartz-feldspatic matrix which, along with increase in FeO \n\nrelated to sulfides and CaO related to carbonate-rich venulations, mask the subsequent increase in \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n\nSiO2 content along the silicification alteration front. The silicification halo is formed from fluids with \n\nhigh temperatures that promote lixiviation of alkalis from the system (Pirajno, 2009). Due to the \n\ndifference in pH and temperature conditions in the fluids, and paragenetic variations regarding \n\nmineralogy, it is attested that the participation of multiple fluids (at least two) was necessary in the \n\ngradative heterogenous hydrothermal system that formed the Ing\u00e1 orebody. The Ing\u00e1 orebody is \n\ntherefore not a typical orogenic gold deposit, suggesting an external influence that is not totally \n\nunderstood. Two main fluids were important in the system, one with an acid pH and low to \n\nintermediate temperature and another with neutral to alkaline pH and high temperature. Late high \n\ntemperature fluids did not totally erase the fabrics created by earlier low to intermediate temperature \n\nfluids. The chloritization of biotite and muscovite occurred along the retrograde metamorphic path at \n\nlower temperatures. The silicification halo thickness decrease along Ing\u00e1 orebody plunge, as well as \n\nthe thickness of the major quartz vein, which reflects less hydrothermal fluid carrying silica down \n\nplunge. The phyllic and potassic alteration haloes thicknesses, in contrast, increase. Undated later BCS \n\nand QGSS dikes crosscut the stratigraphic sequence. \n\nThere is possibly an increase in fluid temperature in the thrust fault III plane. This increase in \n\nfluid temperature might be related to friction in the fault plane during hoarsening. The increase in fluid \n\ntemperature that possibly occurred in the alteration and possible gold remobilization event from \n\ninferred invisible gold rich Aspy2 to form visible gold rich Aspy3 is in agreement with the increase in \n\ntemperature towards the thrust fault III. This increase in temperature is also related to the evolving \n\nconditions of the hydrothermal fluids that formed the alteration haloes (e.g. elevated temperatures \n\nduring potassic and silicification alteration). The formation of Aspy3 also implicated in reduced \n\nconditions, increased sulfur fugacity (fS2) and insignificant oxygen fugacity (fO2) variations. These \n\nconditions acting over Aspy2 possibly promoted a decrease in gold solubility, causing gold \n\nremobilization to Aspy3. The diversity of hydrothermal minerals and the extension of the alteration \n\nhaloes suggest that the hydrothermal alterations were originated from high fluid/rock ratios, followed \n\nby a possible D2 remobilization event with low fluid/rock ratios. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe structural, mineralogical, and geochemical data set of this study provide an insight into \n\nthe geologic history of the Ing\u00e1 orebody Lower Zone. The orebody is composed, from top to bottom, \n\nby massive, brecciated, and laminated dolomite, followed by carbonaceous phyllite (GXN), major \n\ncrack and seal quartz vein (VQZ), quartz-chlorite-sericite-garnet schist (GNCX), and metagraywacke \n\nwith rare altered mafic dikes of biotite-chlorite schist (BCS) and quartz-garnet-sericite schist (QGSS) \n\ncrosscutting the sequence. The Ing\u00e1 orebody is structurally controlled by the thrust fault III (Structure \n\nIII) and related shear zones. Compressive events D1, D2, and D3 affected the orebody configuration. \n\nDuring the retrograde metamorphic path, the hydrothermal alteration developed outwards from the \n\nStructure III and VQZ, affecting the GXN and GNCX. Hydrothermal alteration is characterized \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n\noutwards by silicification, potassic, phyllic, and carbonatic haloes. Different geochemical signatures \n\nclearly define these hydrothermal alteration haloes. The mineralization occurs in three different stages, \n\nmainly in the silicification zone, including: Pyrrhotite \u00b1 Pentlandite \u00b1 Arsenopyrite1 (Stage 1), \n\nArsenopyrite2 (Stage II), Arsenopyrite3 \u00b1 Pyrrothite \u00b1 Chalcopyrite \u00b1 Ilmenite \u00b1 Rutile \u00b1 Magnetite \u00b1 \n\nPentlandite \u00b1 visible Au (Stage III). Visible gold occurs mainly as free crystals in the basal levels of \n\nthe VQZ, as free crystals in the GXN matrix, and rarely in rutile and pyrrhotite margins. The VQZ \n\nbearing gold vein probably had the bulk of the gold deposited in its basal levels by damming of \n\nmineralizing fluids during upward migration. Three types of arsenopyrite are texturally and \n\ngeochemically identified: Aspy1 (early hydrothermal), Aspy2 (late hydrothermal, possibly invisible \n\ngold rich), and Aspy3 (later hydrothermal-remobilization). Visible gold also occurs as inclusions, \n\nfilling fractures or along the margins of Aspy3. The whole-rock Bi ppm x Se ppm and S percent x Bi \n\nppm plots and major gains in As, Ni, and Co in the Aspy rich carbonaceous phyllite silicification zone \n\nmay be used to identify potential Aspy3 and gold rich zones in carbonaceous phyllite host rock. These \n\nindicators should be used carefully due to the use of whole arsenopyrite crystals in the analysis. SEM \n\nand EMP backscattering imaging, SEM-EDS qualitative analysis, EMP, and LA-ICP-MS quantitative \n\nanalysis to differentiate Aspy2 from Aspy3 rich host rock could be used by the exploration geologist \n\nbut is discouraged: sample size is limited, analysis costs are high, and times for treatment are long.  \n\nPossible remobilization of inferred invisible gold in Aspy2 to form visible gold in Aspy3 \n\nalong late crystal fractures and selective alteration towards the margins occurred as a consequence of \n\nF2 folding. Possible remobilization and possible new deposition of visible gold substantially increased \n\nthe orebody gold budget. The current microstructural setting of gold therefore masks a complex \n\nelement mobility history that was linked to hydrothermal alteration and deformation, as suggested by \n\nmicrotextural and geochemical data. We conclude that late high temperature fluids did not totally \n\nerased the fabrics deposited by the earlier low to intermediate temperature fluids, and that the \n\nhydrothermal system at Ing\u00e1 was gradative and heterogenous. This indicates that Ing\u00e1 is not then a \n\ntypical orogenic gold deposit. By now, a not totally understood external influence acted, encouraging \n\nnew studies. Four prospective parameters for Ing\u00e1 type orebodies in the Crix\u00e1s Gold District were \n\nestablished: (1) major crack and seal quartz vein venulations in thrust fault planes and shear zones; (2) \n\nAspy2 and Aspy3 in carbonaceous phyllite adjacent to major quartz vein and thrust fault; (3) E-W \n\naccommodation faults in the F2 folded major quartz vein and; (4) a silicification zone adjacent to the \n\nmajor quartz vein and thrust fault. \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis research was a component of the first author\u2019s M.Sc.
