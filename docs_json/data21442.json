Introduction\n\nAmong the innumerable units composing the Leste \nbasin in Brazil, the basin of the Para\u00edba do Sul River \nstands out (Braga, 2004). This isolated basin extends \nover an area of 57,000 km2 including three states in \nsoutheastern Brazil: S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais and \nRio de Janeiro (Hilsdorf et al., 2002). The region has \nchanged over time, through the influence of human ac-\ntivities carried out with a lack of appropriate conserva-\ntion management. This has led to the felling of gallery \nforests, silting, water pollution, and innumerable other \nenvironmental problems, including those stemming from \nthe construction of a number of reservoirs for electrical \nenergy generation and/or water storage, among these \nthe Paraibuna-Paraitinga and Funil dams (Hilsdorf and \nPetrere Jr., 2002). For these reasons, the state of con-\nservation and composition of the ichthyofauna of the \nreservoirs has received some attention (Ara\u00fajo, 1996; \n\nBizerril, 1999; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2001; Hilsdorf and Petrere, \n2002). However, the smaller affluents that descend the \nslopes of the Serra do Mar and Mantiqueira ranges are \nstill little studied (Braga, 2004).\n\nAccording to Villani et al. (1998), the state of S\u00e3o \nPaulo possesses the largest area of the Atlantic Forest \nand associated coastal ecosystems in the country, rep-\nresenting approximately 7% of its original plant cov-\ner. A large proportion of these remnants is located in \nstate parks, ecological stations, and experimental sta-\ntions, which cover more than 3% of the state\u2019s terri-\ntory. In the Santa Virg\u00ednia Unit of the Serra do Mar \nState Park, some fish species (Brycon opalinus (Cuvier, \n1819), Neoplecostomus microps (Steindachner, 1876) \nand Phalloceros caudimaculatus (Hensel, 1868)) were \nsampled in 1996; nevertheless, the fishes are the least-\n\n\n\nBotelho, MLLA., Gomiero, LM. and Braga, FMS.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 67(4): 741-748, 2007742\n\n60 m. In addition to the nets, sieves, and traps were also \nused. Fish effort was standardized, keeping time and the \nquantity of instruments employed at each point constant. \nThe gill nets were submerged from the end of the day up \nto the next morning.\n\nAfterwards, specimens were kept in plastic contain-\ners containing 10% formalin. Each container received a \nlabel describing date and sample site.\n\nTotal length of individuals were measured in cm, \nmass was measured in grams, repletion degree of the \nstomach, fat degree in the visceral cavity. Three catego-\nries, according to a previously established scale, indi-\ncated the repletion and fat degrees: 1. empty, 2. half-full, \nand 3. full (Braga, 1990). The frequencies of the reple-\ntion degree of the stomach and of the fat degree in the \nvisceral cavity were used to characterize the feeding of \nOligosarcus hepsetus per collection period.\n\nThe stomachs with degree 3 (full) were withdrawn \nfrom the visceral cavity, weighed, and kept in alcohol \ndiluted at 70% (Zavala-Camin, 1996). Food items were \nidentified with stereomicroscopic up to the lowest taxo-\nnomic level reached. To analyze the alimentary items \nfound, the Alimentary Preference Degree (APD), was \nused following Braga (1999) in accordance with the for-\nmula: APD = Si/N, where Si is the sum of the values \nrelated to abundance of the food item (i) in the stomachs \nand N, the total number of the stomachs analyzed. The \nestimated value for the Alimentary Preference Degree \n(APD) for each item is indicated by:\n\nAPD = 4: the chosen item has absolute preference;\n3 ? APD &lt;4: the chosen item has high preference \n\ndegree;\n2 ? APD &lt;3: the chosen item is preferential, \n\notherwise different items are ingested;\n1 ? APD &lt;2: the chosen item is secondary; and\n0 &lt;APD &lt;1: the chosen item is occasional.\nFirst, a general analysis of the food items was done, \n\nand then the Alimentary Preference Degree was analyzed \nfor the remaining items, separated into the categories of \nallochthonous and autochthonous.\n\nThe method of Frequency of Occurrence (Hyslop, \n1980) was also used, which is the percentage between \nthe number of stomachs with preys from a determined \ntaxonomic group and the total number of stomachs with \nfood. This method was used to characterize the food \nby locality and by total-length class of Oligosarcus \n hepsetus.\n\nComparisons of diets between sites (Paraibuna and \nGrande) were made by the non-parametric statistic, \nSpearman rank correlations coefficient-r\n\ns\n (Fritz, 1974; \n\nSiegel, 1975). Comparisons of diets between autoch-\nthonous items and allochthonous items were made by the \nnon-parametric statistic, Mann-Whitney U proof (Siegel, \n1975). With the objective of verifying the variation of \nalimentary items as fish and other categories with the \nlength of the fish, an analysis was applied using a contin-\ngency table (Vanzolini, 1993).\n\nknown vertebrates of the Atlantic Forest (Rosa and \nMenezes, 1996).\n\nFishes with a carnivorous feeding habit increase the \nstability of an ecosystem, being that they act to regulate \nthe abundance of prey species (Nikolsky, 1963; Popova, \n1978). Studies of trophic ecology of carnivorous species \nare very useful in monitoring fishery and management \nprograms, given that these studies furnish important in-\nformation on regulatory mechanisms in populations and \ncommunities of fishes (Zavala-Camin, 1996).\n\nFishes of the genus Oligosarcus have a large buc-\ncal aperture, permitting the ingestion of whole prey in \na single bite (Casatti et al., 2001). Most species of this \ngenus feed mainly on insects, crustaceans and small \nfish (Lowe-McConnell, 1975). The cachorro-magro, \nOligosarcus hepsetus, is a small to medium-sized car-\nnivore, occurring widely in most of the freshwater eco-\nsystems in southeastern Brazil. It mainly inhabits shal-\nlow, densely vegetated microhabitats in small streams or \nalong the banks of larger rivers (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2005).\n\nNotable seasonal changes may occur in the diet of \nfishes according to the area, primarily related to changes \nin composition and availability of food resources, associ-\nated with reproductive pulses and physical and chemical \nchanges in the aquatic ecosystems. Diet may also be in-\nfluenced by ontogenetic effects, which are generally re-\nlated to morphological differences, which lead to chang-\nes in the selection and capture of prey species (Nikolsky, \n1963; Wooton, 1992). Furthermore, knowledge of the \ndiet of fishes provides essential information for ecologi-\ncal research, which also furnishes additional data on the \nentire trophic structure of the ecosystem (Basile-Martins \net al., 1983).\n\nThe objective of the present study was to describe \nthe diet of the fish \u201ccachorro-magro,\u201d Oligosarcus \n hepsetus, in the Santa Virg\u00ednia Unit of the Serra do Mar \nState Park.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n\nWe established two collection localities within the \nbasin of the Para\u00edba do Sul River: the Paraibuna and \nGrande rivers, both within the Santa Virg\u00ednia Unit. \nThis Unit covers 16,000 ha in the municipalities of S\u00e3o \nLuiz do Paraitinga, Natividade da Serra, Cunha and \nUbatuba, located at coordinates 23\u00b0 24\u2019 and 23\u00b0 17\u2019 S \nand 45\u00b0 03\u2019 W. The relief is steeply sloped, with rectilin-\near valleys and hogbacks with altitudes between 860 and \n1,500 m . The vegetation is dense montane ombrophile \nforest with discontinuous patches of forest in the proc-\ness of regeneration, in addition to areas of abandoned \neucalyptus plantations with a sub-wood of native plants. \nThe climate is humid, subject to the Atlantic Tropical air \nmass (Villani et al., 1998).\n\nA total of 12 samples were made monthly from \nJanuary to December 2004. At each sample point, indi-\nviduals were collected using gill nets with mesh sizes of \n1.5; 2.0; 2.5; 3.0; 3.5, and 4.0 cm, measured between ad-\njacent knots (10 m long and 1.5 m high), and totalizing \n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 67(4): 741-748, 2007 743\n\nFeeding of Oligosarcus hepsetus\n\nand in descending order Macrophytes, Crustacean-\nGammaridean, Dipteran pupa, Astyanax sp., Trychoptera \nand Trychopteran larva, each of which represented 2.5% \nof the items found. For the allochthonous items, the \nmost important was Insect remains (50%). In  second \nplace was Coleoptera (20%), and in decreasing or-\nder Arachnida, Dermaptera, Adult Diptera, Gerridae, \nOdonata-Anisoptera, Oligochaeta, Orthoptera and adult \nTrychoptera, each representing 2.5% of the items found. \nIn the Paraibuna River, the autochthonous item with the \nhighest percentage was Dipteran larva (35%), followed \nby Odonata nymphs (25%). The most commonly oc-\ncurring allochthonous item was Insect remains (50%), \nclosely followed by Coleopteran larva (25%). In the \nGrande River, the most frequent autochthonous items \nwere Odonata nymph, Scales and Nematoda, each repre-\nsenting 15% of the items sampled. The most frequent al-\nlochthonous item was Insect remains (50%), closely fol-\nlowed by Coleoptera (approximately 25%) (Figure 5).\n\nThe Alimentary Preference Degree (APD) showed \nthat the most important item was Adult Ephemeroptera \n\n3. Results\n\nA total of 162 specimens of Oligosarcus hepsetus, \nranging in length from 8.5 to 25.0 cm, were collected. \nThe species was more common in the Grande River than \nin the Paraibuna River (Figure 1).\n\nThe distributions of relative frequencies of the reple-\ntion degree of the stomach, by collection, indicated that \nin January through August and in December, most of the \nindividuals collected had degree 1. At the end of winter \nand in spring, individuals more often had a repletion de-\ngree of 2 and 3. This tendency was obvious in the Grande \nRiver, although not in the Paraibuna River (Figure 2).\n\nThe distributions of the relative frequencies of the fat \ndegree in the visceral cavity, by collection, showed that \nthe highest number of individuals with degree of accumu-\nlated fat 3 occurred in October. This was the case in both \nthe Paraibuna River and in the Grande River (Figure 3).\n\nAnalysis of the frequency of occurrence of the food \nitems showed that Insect remains predominated, followed \nby Coleoptera, representing 35% of the items, and Fish \nat 22.5%, followed in decreasing order by Orthoptera, \nOligochaeta, Hemiptera, Dermaptera, Arachnida and \nMacrophytes, each of which represented 2.5% of the \nitems found. In the Paraibuna River, the most impor-\ntant item was also Insect remains (50%), followed by \nColeoptera and Diptera, both representing approximate-\nly 40%. In the Grande River, the most important item \nwas Insect remains (approximately 50%), followed by \nColeoptera and Ephemeroptera, approximately 35% and \n25%, respectively (Figure 4).\n\nA \u201ct\u201d test on the r\ns\n 0.18 indicates that the correlation \n\nis not significant (t = 0.75; t\n0.05;17 \n\n= 2.11; p > 0.05). Thus \nthe diets of the fishes in both sites are quantitatively dif-\nferent.\n\nThe U Mann-Whitney proof applied to the ingested \nautochthonous items and allochthonous items, indicates \nthat the result is significant (U = 109 > U\n\n0.05;17,14\n = 67); \n\ntherefore, a difference exists in the ingestion of items.\nFor the autochthonous items, Odonata nymphs was \n\nthe most important (17.5%), followed by Scales (15%), \n\nFigure 1.

All the food items analyzed \nfor Alimentary Preference Degree were occasional \n(Figure 6).\n\nWhen food items were grouped into categories, the \nmost important was Insects (nymphs and pupas), with a \nAPD of 1.6 (secondary), followed by Adult Insects with \nAPD approximately 1.5 (secondary), decreasing to the \nitem Sediments, with a value close to zero (occasional) \n(Figure 7).\n\nIn the smaller total-length classes (5 to 10 cm), the \nitems Fish and Scales were consumed less (35%) than \nwere other items (67%).

Discussion\n\nAccording to Nikolsky (1963), the low feeding \n activity of piscivorous fishes is expected and can be \nexplained by the better use and nutritional value of the \nfood, which makes it necessary to feed less often. A \nhigh incidence of empty stomachs of many carnivorous-\nichthyophagous species was also found by Goulding \n(1980), Cruz et al. (1990) and Bennemann et al. (1996). \nAlthough Oligosarcus hepsetus showed this character-\nistic, a large number of individuals had full stomachs in \nspring. This may have occurred because of the increased \ntemperature and rainfall, which increase the input of in-\nsects and organic matter into the river, thus making larger \namounts of food items available to the fish, as happened \nwith Oligosarcus jenynsii in Lake Caconde, Rio Grande \ndo Sul state (Hartz et al., 1996).\n\nAnother important fact was the large proportion of \nindividuals with degree 3 of accumulated fat in the au-\ntumn, when food is scarce.

Frequency of occurrence of the food items con-\nsumed by Oligosarcus hepsetus, distributed by total-length \nclasses.\n\nGrande River. This difference between the two localities \ncan be explained by the larger size and greater vegeta-\ntion cover in the Paraibuna River, as well as the lower \nabundance of Oligosarcus hepsetus, which may lessen \nintraspecific competition. This was also observed by \nAlvim and Peret (2004), who concluded that the occur-\nrence of autochthonous as much as allochthonous food \n\nitems is dependent on the gallery forest, hence the im-\nportance of conserving the riverine forest to maintain \nthe ecological balance of a river. From the point of view \nof the biology of the fish, the gallery forest has the fol-\nlowing ecological functions: structural protection of the \nhabitats, regulation of water flow and discharge, shelter \nand shade, maintenance of water quality, filtration of \nsubstances that arrive in the river, and providing organic \nmatter and substrates for fixation of algae and periphyton \n(Barrella et al., 2001). Lowe-McConnell (1987) observed \nthat rivers bordered by native vegetation provide a wide \nvariety of food items, mainly insects and higher plants. \nThese items are of great importance for the survival and \necology of freshwater tropical fishes.\n\nThe Alimentary Preference Degree for the items con-\nsumed by Oligosarcus hepsetus showed that the items \nwere occasional, and when these were grouped, the \nfirst three items were secondary: Insects (nymphs and \npupas); Insects (adults) and Fish. This result was con-\nfirmed by Ara\u00fajo et al. (2005) in Lajes Reservoir, where \nOligosarcus hepsetus showed a carnivorous feeding hab-\nit, feeding only on insects and fish and varying its diet \naccording to the seasons and the zones of the reservoir.\n\nIn Oligosarcus hepsetus the difference in feeding \nduring ontogeny was evident, in that smaller individuals \nwere basically insectivorous and larger ones ichthyopha-\ngous. Hahn et al. (2000) found only fish in the stomachs \nof individuals of Acestrorhyncus lacustris over 10 cm \nlong in the Itaipu Reservoir. Ara\u00fajo et al. (2005) ob-\nserved a similar situation, in which Oligosarcus  hepsetus \nlarger than 19 cm fed principally on fish, in contrast to \nsmaller individuals which fed principally on insects. \nSimilarly, Gealh and Hahn (1998) found for Oligosarcus \n longirostris in the Segredo Reservoir, that smaller indi-\nviduals fed on insects, crustaceans and fish, whereas larg-\ner ones (>16 cm) were exclusively piscivorous.

(2005) reported that larger Oligosarcus hepsetus \nwere apparently able to capture higher-quality prey, i.e., \nwhich was larger, heavier and probably richer in energy. \nThe increase in size is related to morphological changes \n(size of buccal aperture and swimming speed) that may \nfacilitate catching fish. Ontogenetic changes in feeding \nmay also be associated with a decrease in intraspecific \ncompetition, with smaller individuals feeding preferen-\ntially on insects, and larger ones consuming mainly fish \n(Lowe-McConnell, 1987).\n\nAcknowledgments \u2014 The authors wish to thank FAPESP (proc. \n03/05696-1) for financial support, Cotec (proc. 40.673/03), \nIBAMA (aut. 055/2003), Mc.
