Foi \ndefinida uma base geoqu\u00edmica para a regi\u00e3o (RGB) usando o ferro como elemento de refer\u00eancia. \nFatores de enriquecimento (EF) e \u00edndice de geoacumula\u00e7\u00e3o (Igeo) foram empregados para determinar \na contribui\u00e7\u00e3o por origem antropog\u00eanica. Valores de EF mostraram que os sedimentos dos s\u00edtios \n1, 5 e 13 podem ser considerados contaminados por Pb, Cr e Cu, respectivamente. Valores de Igeo \nmostraram que o s\u00edtio 13 pode ser considerado contaminado. H\u00e1 uma grande predomin\u00e2ncia nos \nsedimentos de metais de origem natural. A poss\u00edvel toxicidade foi avaliada comparando com os \nvalores PEC-TEC dos guias de qualidade de sedimentos (SQG). An\u00e1lise de componentes principais \n(PCA) separou claramente os pontos em dois grupos e a an\u00e1lise de agrupamento hier\u00e1rquico (HCA) \nconfirmou as interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es feitas pela PCA.\n\nThe distributions of Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Fe and Al were investigated in surface sediments \ncollected at 19 sites in the Sergipe River Hydrographic Basin of Northeast Brazil. A regional \ngeochemical baseline (RGB) was defined using iron as a reference element. Enrichment factors \n(EF) and geoaccumulation indices (Igeo) were used to determine the extent of anthropogenic \nmetal pollution. EF values showed that sediments from sites 1, 5 and 13 could be considered \ncontaminated by Pb, Cr and Cu, respectively. Igeo values showed that only site 13 could be considered \ncontaminated. For other sites, results indicated that naturally occurring metals predominated in the \nsediments. Possible toxicity related to these metals was examined using the comparing sediment \nchemical data with sediment quality guidelines (SQG) PEC-TEC values. Principal component \nanalysis (PCA) clearly separated the sites into two groups and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) \nconfirmed the interpretations made from the PCA results.\n\nKeywords: sediment, trace metals, Sergipe River, toxicity, multivariate analysis\n\nIntroduction\n\nMetal pollutants have received considerable attention \ndue to their persistence, biogeochemical recycling, and \nenvironmental risk.1 Sediments act as a reservoir for metals \nintroduced into the aquatic environment as a result of natural \ngeochemical processes (such as weathering and erosion \nof geological formations) and anthropogenic activities \n(such as urbanization, industrialization, deforestation, \nland erosion and agricultural practices).2,3 Metals can be \nremobilized and released from sediment into the overlying \nwater column during chemical and biological processes.4,5\n\nHigh metal concentrations in sediment do not \nautomatically imply that contamination has occurred, but \nmay simply reflect the natural mineralogical composition \nof the parent geological material, and the grain size and \norganic matter content of the host sediment.4,5 Many \nstudies of metal accumulation in the aquatic environment \nhave focused on the establishment of geochemical \nbaselines for evaluation of the magnitudes of natural and/\nor anthropogenic metal inputs.2 Knowledge of background \nmetal concentrations, and the natural variability, is therefore \nnecessary before assessments of anthropogenic impacts \ncan be made.6 Various normalization procedures have been \nemployed to take account of natural variability, and to detect \nand quantify anthropogenic enrichment.7,8\n\n\n\nEvaluation of Trace Metal Levels in Surface Sediments of the Sergipe River J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1670\n\nTwo procedures can be used to normalize metal \nc o n c e n t r a t i o n s :  g r a n u l o m e t r i c  a n d  g e o c h e m i c a l \nnormalizations.4 Granulometric normalization involves the \nisolation of a defined grain size fraction by sieving, with the \naim of reducing the dilution effects of non-metal-bearing \nminerals in coarse grained sediment.9,10 Geochemical \nnormalization is based on a procedure that involves \nmathematical correlations between metal concentrations \nand the concentrations of a reference element, such as \nAl, Fe, Li, or Sc. These reference elements are tracers for \nnatural metal-binding phases, and are ideally not influenced \nby anthropogenic inputs.6,11-13 Chemical normalization has \nthe following advantages: (i) a single analytical procedure \ncan be used to determine all necessary elements, including \nthe pollutants and those used for normalization; (ii) minimal \nmanipulation of the sample minimizes contamination; \n(iii) use of the chosen element (or elements) can normalize \nboth grain size and compositional variability.14\n\nIt is accepted that determination of the total concentrations \nof metals in sediments is not sufficient to predict the capacity \nfor mobilization of these elements.15-17 The environmental \nbehavior of trace metals is critically dependent on their \nchemical form, which influences mobility, bioavailability and \ntoxicity to organisms. Consequently, there is considerable \ninterest in understanding the associations of these elements \nwith the solid phase.18,19\n\nThe sediment quality guidelines (SQG) system, \ndeveloped by North American agencies has been adopted \nas an informal tool to evaluate sediment chemical data in \nrelation to possible adverse effects on aquatic biota.8 The \nconsensus-based sediment quality guidelines for fresh \nwaters have been established for 28 chemicals (metals, \npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated \nbiphenyls and pesticides) and for each contaminant provide \ntwo concentrations associated with adverse effects in \naquatic organisms.20 The threshold effect concentration \n(TEC) is that below which no adverse effects should occur, \nand the probable effect concentration (PEC) is that above \nwhich adverse effects may occur frequently.8,20\n\nThere has been no systematic evaluation of the metals \npresent in the sediments of the Sergipe River Hydrographic \nBasin in Northeast Brazil, although a limited number of \nprevious studies have investigated the water and sediment \nquality of individual rivers and estuarine regions of the \nbasin.3,8,15,16,21 The present work therefore describes a \ngeochemical evaluation of trace metals in surface sediments \nof this river basin. Sediment samples were analyzed by \ninductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry \n(ICP OES), in order to define a regional geochemical \nbaseline, to identify impacted areas and assess the extent \nof sediment contamination, and to distinguish natural and \n\nanthropogenic inputs. Calculations were made of metal \nenrichment factors (EF) and geoaccumulation indices (Igeo). \nPossible toxicity was evaluated for each metal, based on \nconsensus-based SQG reference data. Potential factors \ncontrolling the distribution and mobility of metals in the \nsediments were also investigated. Statistical analyses \n(using PCA and HCA) were conducted in order to identify \ncommon origins and/or behaviors of the contaminants.\n\nExperimental\n\nStudy area\n\nThe Sergipe River Hydrographic Basin is located \nin the State of Sergipe (population 1.01 million), in \nthe Northeast of Brazil, between latitudes 10\u00b021\u2019S and \n10\u00b055\u2019S, and longitudes 37\u00b011\u2019W and 37\u00b041\u2019W. It has \nan area of 3673 km2 and drains approximately 16.7% of \nthe State. The climate can be characterized as tropical, \nwith an annual mean temperature of 25 \u00b0C and an average \nannual rainfall of 1333 mm.22 The main tributaries in the \nbasin are the Rivers Sovac\u00e3o, Lages, Campanha, Jacoca, \nVermelho, Jacarecica, Pitanga, Poxim, Salgado, C\u00e1gado, \nGanhamoroba, Parnamirim and Pomonga.22\n\nSince the 1990s, there has been rapid expansion of \naquaculture, industry, and agriculture in the region, with \nsimultaneous development in the areas of civil construction, \ntransportation, and tourism. These dramatic changes have \nadversely affected water quality in the basin.21 The main \nsources of trace metal contamination are municipal and \nindustrial wastewaters, agricultural runoff, and emissions \nfrom metallurgical industries.15,23\n\nSample collection and pretreatment\n\nSediment samples were collected in December 2010, \nat nineteen locations including industrial, residential, \ncommercial and rural sites, in the Sergipe River Hydrographic \nBasin (Figure S1, in Supplementary Information), using a \ncore sampler composed of cellulose acetate butyrate. The \nundisturbed upper 5 cm of the sediment was sampled, and \nthen placed in acid-rinsed polypropylene vessels using a \nplastic spatula. Three samples were taken at each location. \nThe sediments were oven-dried (50 \u00b0C, 12 h), homogenized \nin a porcelain mortar, sieved (&lt;2 mm), and stored in plastic \ncontainers until the analyses were performed.3\n\nReagents\n\nAll reagents were analytical grade or better. Ultrapure \nwater (18 M? cm) was obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q \n\n\n\nSilva et al. 1671Vol. 23, No. 9, 2012\n\nsystem. All glass and plastic utensils were washed with 10% \n(v/v) nitric acid for 48 h, and rinsed with ultrapure water \nprior to use. Stock metal standard solutions (1000 mg L?1) \nwere prepared from standard vials (Tritisol, Merck) \ncontaining 1.000 \u00b1 0.002 g of metal in 2% (v/v) nitric \nacid. Calibration standards of each metal were obtained \nby suitable dilutions of the stock solutions. Three certified \nreference materials, LKSD-1 CCNRP (Canada lake \nsediment), NCS DC 75304 (China river sediment) and \nNCS DC 78301 (China marine sediment) were analyzed \nfor quality control purposes.\n\nTotal metals extraction procedure\n\nThe metals were extracted by digesting portions (ca. \n0.5 g) of the samples in closed Teflon vessels with 2 mL \nof HNO3, 1 mL of HCl and 4 mL of HF, at 140 \n\noC for 2 h. \nAfter cooling, the vessels were opened and heated at 210 oC \nto complete dryness. The residue was dissolved in 10 mL \nof 0.5 mol L-1 HCl, and the final volume was made up to \n50 mL.16 The solutions were stored in polyethylene flasks \nfor later determination of metals using ICP OES.\n\nCalculation of the limit of detection (LOD) for each \nmetal was based on the expression 3s/b, where s is the \nstandard deviation of the blank, and b is the slope of the \ncalibration plot.24 Ten extraction procedure blanks were \nanalyzed, and LOD values took into account the use of \n1 g portions of sample in extractions, together with any \nnecessary dilutions. Correlation coefficients (r) of the \ncalibration curves were better than 0.998, for all elements \nstudied. The results showed that there was no significant \nanalytical contamination, and that LOD values varied \nfrom 0.04 (Cr and Mn) to 0.32 ?g g?1 (Al). These limits \nof detection are acceptable for general environmental \nanalyses, and are comparable to those obtained in previous \nwork using similar materials.16,25-27\n\nThe efficiency of the extraction method was determined \nby analysis of four replicates of certified reference material \n(CRM), for river sediment (NCS DC 75304/China) and \nmarine sediment (NCS DC 78301/China). The results \nshowed that recoveries of the metals from the CRMs were in \nthe range 81-103%. These values indicate that the efficiency \nof the method was satisfactory, given the complex nature \nof the sediment matrix. Similar values have been reported \nin the literature.8,21,25,28\n\nPartial metals extraction procedure\n\nPartial metal concentrations were determined using \nUS EPA Method 200.8. Samples (ca. 1 g) were treated in \nclosed Teflon vessels using 4 mL of (1+1) HNO3 solution \n\nand 10 mL of (1+5) HCl solution. The mixtures were heated \nat 95 oC for 30 min. Following extraction, the samples \nwere filtered using quantitative filter paper, transferred \nto 50 mL volumetric flasks, and the volumes were made \nup using ultra-pure water.16 The solutions were stored in \npolyethylene flasks for later determination of metals using \nICP OES.\n\nTen blank solutions were prepared in the same way as \nsamples during the digestion procedure, and for quality \ncontrol purposes a lake sediment reference material \n(LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada) was analyzed alongside the \nsamples. LOD values (in ?g g?1) varied from 0.001 (Cd) \nto 0.080 (Pb). Recoveries of the trace metals were in the \nrange 97-103%.\n\nOrganic carbon determination\n\nThe carbon contents of the samples were determined \nusing an elemental analyzer with a combustion temperature \nof 900 oC. The organic carbon (Corg) content was calculated \nby the difference in the amount of carbon determined before \nand after calcination of the samples at 550 oC for 1 h.3 For \nanalytical quality control, each set of sample analyses was \naccompanied by three replicate analyses of lake sediment \nreference material (LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada), for which \nthe mean recovery was 98.4 \u00b1 0.7%.\n\nInstrumentation\n\nSediment extractions were performed using PTFE \nvessels and a digester block (Techal TE007A). The carbon \ncontents of the samples were measured using an NCHS-O \nelemental analyzer (Flash ES 1112).\n\nAn inductively coupled plasma optical emission \nspectrometer (ICP OES) with an axial view configuration \n(VISTA PRO, Varian, Mulgrave, Australia) was used \nfor the determination of aluminium, cobalt, chromium, \ncopper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc. The ICP \nOES system was equipped with a solid-state CCD that \nenabled simultaneous measurements to be made in the \nrange 167-785 nm. The instrumental parameters were as \nfollows: 40 MHz radio frequency; 1100 W applied power; \n15.0 L min?1 plasma gas flow rate; 1.5 L min?1 auxiliary gas \nflow rate; 0.8 mL min?1 nebulizer gas flow rate; 0.8 mL min?1 \nsample uptake rate; 1 s signal integration time. The sample \nintroduction system comprised a concentric SeaSpray \nnebulizer and a cyclonic spray chamber. The analysis \nwas carried out at the following wavelengths (nm): Al I \n(396.152); Co II (230.353); Cr II (206.158); Cu I (327.395); \nFe II (259.940); Mn II (259.372); Ni II (221.648); Pb II \n(220.353); Zn II (202.548), where \u201cI\u201d indicates the atomic \n\n\n\nEvaluation of Trace Metal Levels in Surface Sediments of the Sergipe River J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1672\n\nemission line, and \u201cII\u201d indicates the ionic emission line. \nIn most cases, the wavelengths were selected according \nto the most prominent line; secondary lines were used as \nan alternative to avoid possible interferences. All analyses \nwere performed in triplicate.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical \ncluster analysis (HCA) and correlation coefficient \ncalculations were performed using the program Statistica \nfor Windows v. 6.0 (StatSoft Inc., USA). One-way analysis \nof variance (ANOVA) and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test \nwere employed (using Origin v. 7.0) to test for significant \ndifferences (p ? 0.05) in metal concentrations among the \nsites.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nMetal and organic carbon distributions\n\nThe metal and organic carbon contents of the samples \nare presented in Table 1. The ranges of concentrations \nfound were (in ?g g-1) 2.5-35.9 (Co); 4.6-91.9 (Cr); \n2.3-53.7 (Cu); 2.4-37.5 (Ni); 1.9-28.2 (Pb); 2.6-65.6 (Zn) \n\nand (in %) 0.1-4.9 (Fe); 2.7-6.9 (Al). The highest values \nof all elements were obtained for sites 1-3. This could be \ndue to either natural variability between the sediments, \nor to anthropogenic contamination.5,29,30 Organic carbon \n(Corg) contents varied between 0.2 and 2.9%, with highest \nvalues for sites 7, 10 and 19, indicating an anthropogenic \ncontribution.22 The main sources of organic matter are \nmunicipal and industrial wastewaters, and agricultural \nrunoff.15\n\nCorrelation analysis was used to identify potential \nfactors controlling the distribution and mobility of metals \nin the sediments. The Spearman correlation matrix obtained \nis provided in Table 2. The linear regression analysis \ncan provide information about the similarity of natural \nand anthropogenic sources, as well as the environmental \nbehavior of metals. Significance was indicated by values \nof the correlation coefficient greater than 0.60 (using a \nconfidence level of 95%).\n\nStrong correlations were observed between most of the \ntrace metals and iron (r > 0.7) and manganese (r > 0.6), with \nthe exception of Cu (r = 0.5). However, weak correlations \nwere observed with aluminum (r &lt;0.4) (Table 2). The \nstrong correlations between manganese and iron, and \nbetween iron and the other metals, showed that iron and \nmanganese were the main inorganic carriers that controlled \n\nTable 1.

A possible explanation for the \nrelatively low correlation between Al and the other metals \nis natural variability of metal concentrations between \nsediments of the Sergipe River Basin. Iron has also been \nsuccessfully used as a normalizer in other studies.2,5,6,9,31\n\nThe trace metals showed no correlation with Corg \n(r &lt;0.10), indicative of no, or weak, association between \nthese elements and organic matter in the sediments. This is \nin agreement with the finding that, in non-marine sediments, \nCorg is a weaker carrier than clays and metal oxides.\n\n8,32\n\nThere were significant correlations (0.62 &lt;r &lt;0.95) \nbetween the different trace metals (Table 2), indicative \nof a natural origin and/or similar contamination sources \nof the metals. The correlation coefficients revealed that \nFe was the most suitable conservative element for metal \nnormalization purposes.\n\nGeochemical normalization\n\nIn order to determine the extent of contamination of \nthe sediments, trace metal concentrations were normalized \nrelative to iron. Various reference elements have previously \nbeen used for this purpose, notably iron,2,5,32 aluminium,8,33,34 \nlithium8,13,29 and scandium.1,35,36\n\nGeochemical normalization uses data obtained for \nuncontaminated sediments of a given region to calculate \nthe linear regression between concentrations of the metal \nof interest and those of the reference element, and then \ntests the metal/reference ratios obtained for other (possibly \ncontaminated) sites.13 The relationships between trace \nmetals and reference elements can be used to indicate \nthe range of naturally occurring concentrations of trace \n\nmetals.5,29,37 The regressions between the metals and the \nnormalizer (reference element) are performed following \nremoval of outlier values, and delineation of a 95% \nprediction interval. The data points obtained for a possibly \ncontaminated area are then projected onto the resulting \ngraph. All points lying within the 95% prediction intervals \ncorrespond to samples that can be characterized as natural \nsediments, while points located above this region may \nindicate sediment contamination.9,11,13\n\nThe linear regression results, with values of r2 and p, \nas well as the 95% prediction intervals, are illustrated in \nFigure 1. The upper 95% prediction interval was used as \nthe cutoff to identify metal enrichment in the sediments.\n\nMn and Zn (Figures 1f and 1g) showed similar \ndistribution patterns, with all sites lying within the 95% \nprediction limits. The concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu, Ni \nand Pb showed enrichment at one or more sampling sites \n(Figures 1a-e), indicating possible contamination. Ni \nand Pb (Figures 1d and 1e) showed concentrations much \nhigher than the 95% prediction limits at site 1, indicating \nstrong enrichment of the metals in the sediment. Cobalt \nshowed enrichment at sites 2 and 6 (Figure 1a), and there \nwas possible anthropogenic influence for Cr (Figure 1b) \nat site 5. These sites were located in regions where there \nis intense agricultural activity.22 Copper was enriched \nat site 13 (Figure 1c), located in the densely populated \nregion.22 Hence, metal concentrations in the sediments \nanalyzed could be considered to be due to natural origins, \nexcept at sites 1, 2, 5, 6 and 13, and the regression lines \nobtained could be used to define the regional geochemical \nbaseline (RGB).\n\nThe data using in the geochemical normalization \nwere obtained by extraction using HF, HNO3 and HCl \nto determine the total concentrations of metals. The \ntotal sediment concentration of a metal does not provide \ninformation concerning its mobility, availability or toxicity. \n\nTable 2.

The solid line \nrepresents the regression line; the dashed lines define the 95% prediction limit; ? indicates the reference sites.\n\n\n\nSilva et al. 1675Vol. 23, No. 9, 2012\n\nToxicity is dependent on the amount of metal available \nfor bioaccumulation (accumulation by organisms), and \nit depends on those sediment properties that affect its \nbioavailability. Hence, it is possible for sediment to be \nmetal-contaminated (to have a metal content higher than \nthe natural background), but not manifest any toxic effects, \ndepending on the geochemical processes that control the \navailability of the metal in the sediment.\n\nEnrichment factors (EF)\n\nFor better estimation of anthropogenic inputs, \nenrichment factors (EF) were calculated for each metal, as \ndescribed by Aloupi and Angelidis,13 using the expression  \n( [ m e t a l ] / [ F e ] ) s a m p l e/ ( [ m e t a l ] / [ F e ] ) b a c k g r o u n d,  w h e r e  \n([metal]/[Fe])sample is the metal to Fe ratio in a sample, and \n([metal]/[Fe])background is the natural background value of \nthe metal to Fe ratio. For any given Fe concentration, the \nmetal concentration on the linear regression line was used \nas the background value, and the concentration lying on the \nupper 95% prediction limit was used as a comparison value \n(CV). Due to natural mineralogical differences between the \nsediments and analytical uncertainty, only sediments with \nan EF greater than 2.0 were considered to be enriched.38\n\nCompared to other methods based on the use of global \nbackgrounds, such as average shale values39 or average \ncrustal values,40 an advantage of the RGB technique is that \nit takes into account the natural geochemical variability \nrelated to different settings and sediment characteristics.4 \nAccording to Mil-Homens et al.,41 the use of global \nbackground data can result in erroneous interpretation of \nEF values, and underestimation of metal enrichment.\n\nTable 3 shows calculated sediment enrichment factors \nfor Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb, together with comparison \nvalues. The EF values indicate that the most contaminated \nsediments were those from sites 1, 5 and 13, where there \nwas substantial anthropogenic activity. Relatively strong \nenrichment of Cu (EF > 3) was found for site 13, located \nin an area of intensive ship traffic. According to Idris,17 \nenrichment by Cu is often related to ship maintenance \n\nand the corrosion of metallic materials. The anti-fouling \npaint used on the hulls of ships is one of the major sources \nof pollution by Cu in the aquatic environment.42,43 There \nwas an enrichment of Cr at site 5 (EF &lt;3), which could \nbe due to industrial activities. Silva et al.44 found a high \nconcentration of Cr associated with effluents from sugar, \nleather, and paper factories in the Mogi Gua\u00e7u River Basin \nof Southeast Brazil. Moderate Pb enrichment was only \nobserved for site 1 (EF = 2.08), which could be due to \ninputs of agricultural effluents. Gimenon-Garcia et al.45 \nfound that Pb was present as an impurity in fertilizers and \npesticides applied to agricultural soils.\n\nGeoaccumulation index (Igeo)\n\nThe geoaccumulation index (Igeo), first described by \nM\u00fcller,46 was used here as a second criterion to identify \ncontaminated sediments (Table 4). Igeo is defined by the \nexpression: log2 [Cn/1.5Bn], where Cn is the measured \nconcentration and Bn is the geochemical background \nconcentration of the metal \u201cn\u201d. The factor 1.5 is a constant \nthat helps take account of lithological variability. The \nmetal concentration on the regression line was used as the \nbackground value, as reported in previous studies.1,8,47 Igeo \ncan then be used as a reference to estimate the extent of \nmetal pollution, in a similar way as the enrichment factor.48\n\nThe index is based on a qualitative pollution intensity \nscale, whereby sediments can be classified as unpolluted \n\nTable 3.

Sediment from site 13 (near \nshipping activities) was in the unpolluted to moderately \npolluted category, with respect to Co, Cr, Ni and Pb, and \nin the moderately polluted category, with respect to Cu. \nThe results obtained using both procedures (EF and Igeo) \ntherefore showed that only site 13 could be considered to \nbe contaminated with Cu.\n\nSediment toxicity: TEC-PEC predictions\n\nThe TEC and PEC concentrations presented in the \nconsensus-based sediment quality guidelines (SQG), \ndeveloped by MacDonald et al.,20 have been adopted as \nan informal tool to evaluate sediment chemical data in \nrelation to possible adverse effects on aquatic biota. TEC \nand PEC values indicate concentrations at which toxicity \ncould start to be observed, and above which adverse effects \nmight occur, respectively.8,20 The SQG criteria were derived \nand validated using data only for fresh water and marine \necosystems of the USA, but despite this limitation have \nbeen used to interpret data for sediments from various \nglobal regions.3,8,20,49-51\n\nIn order to allow assessment of toxicity based on SQG \ncriteria, partial trace metal concentrations were determined \nfollowing extraction using nitric and hydrochloric acids, \nwhich is a procedure compatible with that used in the \ndevelopment of the SQG. Table 5 shows the partial \nconcentrations obtained for each metal, together with the \nrespective PEC and TEC values.\n\nThe ranges of metal concentrations found for sites 1, \n2, 5, 6 and 13 were (?g g-1): 11.3-47.7 (Cr); 4.57-26.3 \n\n(Cu); 4.46-30.6 (Ni); 2.36-19.5 (Pb) and 5.71-42.4 (Zn). \nFor all the sites studied, the values were below the TEC, \nwith respect to the trace metals Cu, Pb, and Zn, indicating \nthat adverse effects on aquatic biota should be unlikely to \noccur. Cr and Ni showed concentrations superior to the \nTEC (43.34 and 22.7 mg g-1) at site 1 (47.7 and 30.6 mg g-1),  \nthe ability of TEC to predict adverse effects is lower for Cr \nand Ni than for the other metals.20 The predictive ability of \nthe TEC achieved 72% for Cr and Ni, and 82% for Cu, Pb \nand Zn. This signifies that the probability of the incidence \nof adverse biological effects at concentrations below the \nTEC is 28% for Cr and Ni, and 18% for Cu, Pb and Zn.20\n\nIt must be emphasized that SQG criteria should be \nused with caution, as there cannot be any guarantee of a \ncomplete absence of toxicity at concentrations lower than \nthe TEC, or that samples where the PEC is exceeded must \nnecessarily be toxic, particularly considering that the SQG \nwere not specifically developed for tropical conditions. For \ngreater confidence, it is important that the results obtained \nhere should be validated using toxicity tests.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA)\n\nPCA enables data reduction and description of a given \nmultidimensional system by means of a smaller number of \nnew variables. It has been widely applied to identify the \nsources of metals found in sediments, and to distinguish \nnatural and anthropogenic inputs.3,8,15,16 A data matrix was \nconstructed using the concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, \nNi, Pb, Zn, Fe, Al and Corg as columns and the nineteen \nsampling sites as rows (Table 1). PCA was performed on \nauto-scaled data. The loadings of the original variables \nin the first two principal components, and the variances \nexplained by each component, are given in Table 6.\n\nThe first two principal components were chosen \nfor modeling the data because they described 77.75% \nof the total variance. The remaining variance probably \nrepresented noise, since further principal components did \n\nTable 5.

Sediments from the \nsites in group I (on the left side of the graph) contained the \nhighest concentrations of the trace metals Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, \nPb, and Zn, as well as iron. Sites 9 and 10 had estuarine \n\ncharacteristics, while sites 1-3 and 6 were located in the \nagriculture region.22 The sites of group II are located to \nthe right along the PC1 axis. The lowest concentrations \nof metals were measured for sediments from sites 17-19, \nwhich were located in the upper regions of the hydrographic \nbasin where there was little evidence of domestic and/or \nindustrial activities. Other group II sites were located in \nregions were close to urban areas.22\n\nThe high negative loadings of Al and Corg suggest the \nexistence of a relationship between these species that could \nhave influenced the dispersion of the sites along the PC2 \naxis. The concentrations of Al and Corg at the different sites \nincreased from top to bottom in the graph, with evidence \nfor particularly high concentrations of aluminosilicates \nand organic matter at sites 10 and 19. However, correlation \nbetween Al and Corg was not observed for other sites.\n\nHierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)\n\nHCA, the most common cluster analysis technique used \nin environmental analysis, identifies groups of samples \naccording to their similarities. HCA is a powerful tool for \nanalyzing data sets to detect both expected and unexpected \nclusters, including the presence of outliers. This method can \nbe used to group sediments according to their geochemical \ncomposition.17-19 The sediment samples from the nineteen \nsites were hierarchically clustered on the basis of their \nnormalized metal concentrations. The clusters were \ngenerated using Ward\u2019s method with Euclidean distances. \nThe dendrogram obtained contained two distinct clusters \n(Figure 3). The first cluster, consisting of sites 1-3, 6, 9 \nand 10, showed approximately 85% dissimilarity with \nthe second cluster. These results were in agreement with \nthose obtained using PCA, and suggest that these six sites \n\nTable 6.

Iron was shown to be a suitable \nreference element for definition of a regional geochemical \nbaseline (RGB) for the trace metals. Metals in sediments \nfrom sites 3, 4, 7-12 and 14-19 were mainly derived from \nnatural origins, and could be used to define the RGB.\n\nEnrichment factors and geoaccumulation indices were \ncalculated for each metal by dividing its ratio to the reference \nelement by the same ratio found for the RGB. Calculated EF \nvalues showed that sediments from sites 1, 5 and 13 could \nbe considered contaminated by Pb, Cr and Cu, respectively. \nThe sediments were classified as unpolluted to moderately \npolluted, according to the Igeo. A value of Igeo higher than 1 \nwas only obtained for Cu at site 13 (near shipping activities), \nindicating that there was no large-scale Cu contamination of \nthe sediments of the Sergipe River Basin.\n\nPossible toxicity related to these metals was examined \ncomparing sediment chemical data with TEC-PEC values. \nResults indicated that adverse effects on aquatic biota \nshould rarely occur, with respect to the trace metals Cu, \nPb, and Zn.\n\nPCA clearly separated the sites into two groups: \nI (sites 1-3, 6, 9 and 10); II (sites 4, 5, 7 and 11-19). HCA \nconfirmed the interpretations made from the PCA results.\n\nSupplementary Information \n\nSupplementary data is available free of charge at  \nhttp://jbcs.sbq.org.br as PDF file.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento \nde Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior (CAPES) and Conselho \nNacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico \n(CNPq) for fellowships, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Apoio \u00e0 Pesquisa e \n\u00e0 Inova\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica do Estado de Sergipe (FAPITEC) \nfor financial support (Process 019.203.01714/2010-9), and \nInstituto Tecnol\u00f3gico e de Pesquisa do Estado de Sergipe \n(ITPS) for technical support of this study.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.
