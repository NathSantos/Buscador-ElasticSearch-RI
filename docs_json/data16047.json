However, there is little information about the bioavailability of the\nonly controlled-release lithium formulation available in Brazil. The objective of this study was to compare the\nbioavailability of controlled-release and immediate-release lithium formulations, after single and multiple doses.\nMethods: Twelve healthy volunteers received 900 mg of immediate-release or controlled-release lithium carbonate in\nsingle or multiple doses during 9 days. After single dose administration, the following parameters were analyzed for\neach formulation: maximum lithium concentration (C\n\nmax\n); time to reach C\n\nmax\n (t\n\nmax\n); area under the curve of serum\n\nconcentration versus time (AUC\n0-12\n\n and AUC\n0-?) and the elimination half-life (t1/2 elim.). After multiple doses, Cmax;\n\nt\nmax\n\n; AUC\n0-12\n\n; mean (C\nmean\n\n) and minimum drug concentration (C\nmin\n\n) and degree of fluctuation (DF) were analyzed. A\n90% confidence interval (90%CI) for the ratio between the AUCs for each formulation was constructed.\nResults/Discussion: Following single dose, the two formulations were bioequivalent; however, they were not\nafter multiple doses. This fact could be a consequence of methodological limitations of lithium level\u2019s measurements\nsince, following single dose, these levels could not be detected at time periods 24 and 48h in many volunteers,\ncompromising the calculation of t\n\n1/2 elim\n ,and consequently of the AUC\n\n0-? and the 90%CI to the ratio of these areas.\nTherefore, the bioequivalence found after single dose may be an unreliable result.\n\nLithium carbonate.

However, this\nkind of formulation produces high lithium blood levels, which\nhave been associated to side effects and intoxication originated\nfrom the product.5\n\nAlternatively, the modified or controlled-release formula-\ntions provide specific advantages over immediate-release for-\nmulations, due to decreased blood peaks secondary to a\nshowed absorption rate. The elimination phase of the drug\u2019s\ndecreasing curve is altered, causing an increase in the elimi-\nnation half-life, allowing to the administration of a daily single\ndose instead of the traditional divided doses \u2013 two or three\n(b.i.d. or t.i.d.)\u2013, diminishing the chance of patients forget-\nting the drug, and increasing their compliance. Besides, the\nchance of survival after an overdose rises as there is more\ntime for a gastric lavage before the plasmatic concentration\nreaches its peak value.6-8\n\nThere have been several studies comparing the bioavailability\nof the controlled-release formulations existent in the world mar-\nket.9-11 Nevertheless, there is scarce information about the\nbioavailability of the only product with controlled-release lithium\navailable in Brazil.12\n\nThe objective of this study is to compare the bioavailability\nof controlled and immediate-release formulations of lithium car-\nbonate (Carbolithium CR 450 mg and Carbolithium 300 mg;\nEurofarma Laborat\u00f3rios Ltda, SP, Brazil) after administration of\nsingle and multiple (nine days) doses to healthy volunteers.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nTwelve healthy, Caucasian, male volunteers (aging 18 to 30),\n\nselected through an advertisement in the premises of the Fed-\neral University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Unifesp) participated in the study.\nThe Institution\u2019s Research Ethics Committee previously ap-\nproved the study. The volunteers gave written informed con-\nsent before beginning the study. They all went through physi-\ncal and psychiatric assessment, with the Structured Clinical\nInterview for the DSM-IV axis I disorders \u2013 non- patient edi-\ntion13 and routine laboratory tests (hemogram, creatinine, uric\nacid, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase [GOT], glutamic piruvic\ntransaminase [GPT], thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], free\ntetraiodothyronine [T\n\n4-\n], cholesterol, triglycerids, urea, glucose\n\nand magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine). The pres-\nence of any result with a clinically significant deviation from\nthe normality was an exclusion criterion.\n\nThe volunteers were instructed to abstain from consuming\nalcohol, drugs and any other kind of medications during the\nstudy\u2019s period.\n\nWe used immediate-release lithium carbonate (Carbolithium\n300 mg \u2013 lot 016.98), and controlled-release (Carbolithium CR\n450 mg \u2013 lot 004.98) formulations, donated by Eurofarma\nLaborat\u00f3rios Ltda (SP, Brazil).\n\nThe study consisted in a two-phase cross-over study (I:\nsingle dose and II: multiple doses) in which the 12 volunteers\nwere randomically divided in two groups (A and B). They\nwere instructed to fast for 10 hours before the beginning of\nthe procedure and 4 hours after drug administration. In phase\nI, the volunteers received 900 mg of lithium carbonate as a\nsingle dose at 8:00h A.M. (group A: immediate release formu-\nlation and group B controlled-release formulation). Blood\nsamples 5 ml were collected immediately before the ingestion\nof the drug (time 0) and after the time intervals 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3,\n4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours. A week after, the procedure was\nrepeated, and treatments were alternated.\n\nIn phase II, both groups of volunteers (A and B) received 900\nmg/day of lithium carbonate during nine days. Group A re-\nceived 2 immediate-release pills at 8:00 A.M. and 1 pill at 08:00\nP.M., and group B received 1 controlled-release pill at 8:00 A.M\nand other at 08:00 P.M. Blood samples were collected on the\neighth day of treatment, immediately before the morning inges-\ntion of the drug (time zero) and afterwards in the same time\nintervals (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48). The blood lithium\nwas determined in triplicate with the ion-selective electrode tech-\nnique (EasyLyte Na/K/Cl/Li Analyzer \u2013 Medica Corporation,\nMassachusetts, USA).\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters were determined according to\nthe rules of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),14 of the\nUnited States Pharmacopeia15 and of the National Sanitary Vigi-\nlance Agency from Brazil.16\n\n\u2022 Phase I \u2013 single dose: AUC: area under the curve (in\nmEq.h/l) delineated by the drug\u2019s concentration versus\ntime, calculated by the trapezoidal method from time zero\nto time 12 h (AUC\n\n0-t\n) and extrapolated to infinitum (AUC\n\n0-\n\n?); t1/2: elimination half-life time, corresponds to the time\nneeded for a drug to reach half of the initial blood\nconcentration; C\n\nmax\n: corresponds to the maximum lithium\n\nconcentration, in mEq./l, directly obtained from individu-\nal curves of concentration vs. time; T\n\nmax\n: refers to the\n\ntime, in hours, in which C\nmax\n\n was achieved. This value\nwas directly obtained from individual curves of blood\nconcentration vs. time.\n\n\u2022 Phase II \u2013 multiple doses: AUC\n0-12\n\n; C\nmax\n\n; T\nmax\n\n; C\nmin\n\n: drug\nconcentration at the end of each interval between doses,\nin the steady state, directly obtained from the graph of\nblood concentration vs. time for each subject, in mEq/l;\nC\n\nmean\n: mean drug concentration (mEq/l) in the steady state,\n\nobtained by the equation: C\nmean\n\n = (AUC\n0-t\n\n)/?, where ?\ncorresponds to the interval between doses (in this case,\n12 hours); %F: the degree of fluctuation of drug\nconcentrations, calculated by the equation: %F = [(C\n\nm\u00e1x \n\u2013\n\nC\nmin\n\n)/ C\nmean \n\n] x 100%.\nThe AUC parameter was used to obtain the 90% confidence\n\ninterval (90%CI) for the differences of means between con-\ntrolled-release and immediate-release products, transformed into\nthe Neperian logarithm (ln). As this is a study with a controlled-\nrelease product, this conclusion does not take into account the\nconfidence interval obtained for C\n\nmax\n, as this is intentionally\n\nmodified in this kind of formulation. Two drug formulations are\n\n\n\nRev Bras Psiquiatr 2002;24(2):74-9\n\n7 6\n\nLithium carbonate\nVismari L et al.\n\nconsidered bioequivalent when the antilogs of the 90%CIs for\nthe ratios of AUC means fall between 0.8 and 1.25.\n\nThe parameters AUC\n0-t\n\n and C\nmax\n\n were submitted to analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) to assess if there were effects\nformulation\u2019s order of administration of the i.e., of phase (I and\nII) and of treatment (immediate and controlled-release).\n\nThe other pharmacokinetic parameters of immediate and con-\ntrolled-release formulations were compared with paired t test,\nexcept for the T\n\nmax\n, for which it has been recommended a non-\n\nparametric analysis (Wilcoxon\u2019s test).17\n\nThe assessment of adverse effects of the two lithium carbon-\nate formulations was performed by a Side Effects Scale, devel-\noped by the researchers and composed of the 21 main adverse\neffects cited in the literature for this drug. For each of them, the\nvolunteer should choose the option that better described its\nintensity at the moment, which varied from the degree zero (ab-\nsence of effect) to 3 (great effect). This scale was administered\nin phase I (before the drug administration and 3, 6 and 12 hours\nafter it) and in phase II (before the beginning of the treatment\nand after eight days).\n\nResults\nThe sample was composed by 12 healthy, young (age\n\n23.7\u00b13.4), male volunteers with a mean body mass of 74.7\u00b19.6\nKg, mostly students or employees in the University.\n\nDuring phase I (single dose administration), lithium blood\nlevels in several collecting time-points were under the assay\u2019s\nsensitivity level (0.2 mEq/l). Therefore, only in 7 out of 12\ncollections the concentrations were detectable in all volun-\nteers: time 0 (before the ingestion of lithium, considered as\nblood lithium zero) and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after the drug\nadministration.\n\nA three-way ANOVA revealed absence of order effects(firstly\nimmediate or controlled release) or treatment (controlled or im-\nmediate-release formulations) in the measurements of AUC\n(F=0.11 and 1.48, respectively, p>0.05) and C\n\nmax\n (F=0.66 and\n\n4.50, respectively; p>0.05), but a significant phase effect (single\nor multiple doses) in AUC\n\n0-t\n and C\n\nmax\n (F=91.5 and 36.51; respec-\n\ntively, p<0.001). The ANOVA also revealed a significant inter-\naction between phase and treatment for AUC (F=147.6; p<0.001)\nand C\n\nmax\n (F=48.96; p<0.001).\n\nData analysis from phase I (single dose) showed that the\ncontrolled-release formulation produced smaller AUC\n\n0-12\n and\n\nC\nmax\n\n when compared to the immediate-release formulation\n(Table 1). However, there was no difference between the for-\nmulations\u2019 AUC\n\n0-?, since the 90%CI for the mean differences\nbetween formulations was into the values pre-established by\nthe FDA (0.8 to 1.25). The statistical analysis of the remaining\nparameters showed that the controlled-release formulation\nproduced a significantly higher T\n\nmax\n than the immediate-re-\n\nlease formulation (z=2.803, p<0.01), but the t\n1/2elim. \n\nwas not dif-\nferent for both formulations (t=-1.37; p>0.05).\n\nThe values (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) of the curve of\nlithium concentration versus time in healthy volunteers after\na 900-mg single dose of immediate and controlled-release\nlithium carbonate are in Figure 1.

Regarding the C\n\nmax\n\nproduced by both products, they were similar in volunteers\n4 and 11.\n\nThe data analysis of Phase II (multiple-dose administration)\nrevealed that both formulations were similar as regards the C\n\nmax\n\n(Table 2). However, the time to reach the maximum concentration,\nor T\n\nmax\n, was longer after the administration of the controlled-\n\nrelease formulation. Formulations also differed as concerns the\nAUC\n\n0-12, since the confidence interval for mean differences be-\ntween formulations was not within the limits pre-established by\nthe FDA (0.8 to 1.25). For the remaining parameters, the con-\ntrolled-release formulation produced a higher mean minimum\nblood concentrations of the drug than the immediate-release for-\nmulation, with a lower percentage of concentration fluctuation\n(%F) along the day.

After a single dose the C\nmax\n\n of the controlled-re-\nlease formulation was significantly lower than that of the im-\nmediate-release. T\n\nmax\n of controlled-release formulation was sig-\n\nnificantly longer than that of immediate release. These results\nare in accordance with the profile of a controlled-release drug,\ni.e., the production of lower blood concentrations in a longer\ntime interval after the drug administration.\n\nThe elimination half-life time after the single dose treat-\nment with controlled-release lithium carbonate (Carbolithium\nCR 450 mg) and the immediate-release (Carbolithium 300 mg)\nformulations did not differ (t\n\n1/2elim\n: controlled-release\n\n=39\u00b16.71; immediate-release =34.25\u00b110.75). However, it was\nexpected that the controlled-release formulation would have\na higher t\n\n1/2elim\n, allowing to a decreased frequency of the\n\ntreatment administration.6 A possible explanation for this\nresult is that during this study phase (single dose), due to\nthe fact that some volunteers\u2019 lithium blood after 24 hours\nwere under the assay\u2019s lower detection limit (0.2 mEq/L),\ntheir values have not been measured and, therefore, have\nbeen considered as absence of lithium. Thus, the determina-\ntion of the elimination rate constant (?\n\nz\n), which is calculated\n\nbased on the individual curve of the plasma concentration\nvs. time was compromised as well as the determination of the\nT\n\n1/2elim \n(T\n\n1/2elim \n=(ln2)/?\n\nz\n).\n\nAfter multiple doses of immediate and controlled-release\nlithium carbonate formulations there were no bioequivalence,\nas the 90%CI for the AUCs\n\n0-12\n was 1.15 - 1.28. The controlled-\n\nrelease formulation produced minimum (C\nmin\n\n) and mean (C\nmean\n\n)\nserum lithium concentrations significantly higher than those of\nthe immediate-release formulation, and a lower fluctuation of\nconcentrations (%F). Knowing that the fluctuation is a mea-\nsure of the effectiveness of sustained released formulation,5,10\n\nwhich has been usually related to a lower incidence of side-\neffects, the results indicate that the controlled-release formula-\ntion could be a safe alternative for the patients\u2019 treatment. How-\never, both formulations were similar regarding the maximum\nconcentration produced, the opposite to what was expected for\n\nthis kind of product. This may be due to the fact that multiple\ndoses of the controlled-release formulation had produced a high\nincidence of diarrhea, thus leading to sodium loosening in the\nfeces and a consequent lithium retention, as these ions tend to\nmaintain an equilibrium. This might have raised the blood lev-\nels of this drug, producing a higher C\n\nmax\n. However, there was no\n\nalteration in the T\nmax\n\n, and the controlled-release formulation\ncontinued to produce C\n\nmax\n after a longer administration time\n\nthan the immediate-release formulation.\nAlthough lithium has a linear pharmacokinetics with the doses\n\nclinically used, the results of the current study showed differ-\nences in the bioequivalence after single and multiple doses of\nboth formulations. Possibly the bioequivalence observed after\nthe single dose stems from the problem occurred with levels of\ndetection of lithium after 24 hours in some volunteers. This may\nhave compromised the correct determination of the T\n\n1/2elim\n (as\n\nalready mentioned) and consequently the estimates of AUC\n0-?,\n\nas AUC\n0-?= AUCt + Ct/?z.\n\nThe parameter usually accepted to measure the absorbed\ndrug amount is the AUC, which is proportional to the drug\u2019s\nabsorbed fraction, provided its elimination process be linear.\nHowever, many times this process is not linear or can be modi-\nfied by the excipient, making the elimination not constant.\nTherefore, equal AUCs are not a sufficient proof that the ab-\nsorbed fractions are equal, even in a linear elimination pro-\ncess.18 Due to that, other parameters have been proposed for\nthese studies.19-21\n\nOther questionable aspect is whether the pharmacological\nbioequivalence is a measure of the therapeutic equivalence\nof both products, i.e., the absence of pharmacological\nbioequivalence necessarily would indicate a lack of thera-\npeutic equivalence?22\n\nAcknowledgments\nTo the National Research Council (CNPq); the Association\n\nFund of Incentive to Psychopharmacology (AFIP) for their fi-\nnancial sponsoring.\n\nReferences\n1 .
