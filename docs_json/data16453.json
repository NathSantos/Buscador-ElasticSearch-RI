There are many uncertainties inherent in petroleum contracts and our goal is\n\nto analyze the effects of asymmetric information in the relationship between a regulator\n\nand an oil company. In general, the company has superior information about the charac-\n\nteristics of a certain area to be explored and, once a discovery is made, the company has\n\nmore information about its efficiency in oil extraction. Thus, the regulator must provide\n\nincentives for the company to reveal its private information.\n\nOur work is based on the regulation model with investment in Laffont and Tirole\n\n(1993) and in Aghion and Quesada (2010). The former is a classical regulation model\n\nunder asymmetric information, and the latter is a work applied to the oil industry.\n\nAghion and Quesada (2010) use contract theory to analyze potential sources of\n\ninefficiencies in petroleum contracts signed between two parties: the government and\n\nan oil company. They develop a simple model of exploration and production, in which\n\nthere is sunk investment in exploration and, conditional on discovery, extraction requires a\n\nnoncontractible effort. The model addresses uncertainties inherent in petroleum contracts\n\nand, in light of recent events, the main concern is to understand why governments may\n\nrenege on past agreements with oil companies on the grounds that those agreements were\n\nunfair.\n\nInvestments are risky because the existence, size, and quality of the reserve are\n\nuncertain, and the drilling costs are very difficult to anticipate. In most countries, gov-\n\nernment owns natural resources under the surface, hence a new goverment may force\n\ncontract renegotiations. Aghion and Quesada (2010) also say that sunk investments in\n\noil exploration are large and very specific in nature and, therefore, if the oil company is\n\nin charge of the investment, it is subject to opportunistic behavior and holdup when a\n\ndiscovery is made. After production begins, the government may increase taxes or even\n\nexpropriate the firm to increase its take. The company takes into account that possibility\n\nand underinvests.\n\nAnother issue discussed is poor enforcement. Aghion and Quesada (2010) say that\n\ncontracts may not be fully enforceable in the absence of an impatial third party within the\n\ncountry\u2019s judiciary system. Thus, if the company believes there is a positive probability\n\nthat the contract is not enforced, it underinvests and, to maximize its profits before the\n\nstate reneges the contract, it increases the extraction rate. Furthermore, there is the\n\nclassic moral hazard problem related to nonverifiable effort. If the oil company does\n\nnot appropriate all the benefits of its production effort, the efficient level of effort is not\n\nachieved.\n\n\n\n2\n\nIn our model, we eliminate some of the sources of contractual inefficiency addressed\n\nin Aghion and Quesada (2010). We assume that contracts are always enforced and, in\n\nour framework, the government does not have the possibility to adopt an opportunistic\n\nbehavior, since there is full commitment. Furthermore, we do not analyze the existing\n\ncontract forms, which is done in their work. However, we consider additional sources of\n\ninefficiency, focusing on the effects of asymmetric information on petroleum contracts.\n\nWe take some important features of Aghion and Quesada (2010) and adapt their model\n\nto the framework in Laffont and Tirole (1993).\n\nLaffont and Tirole (1993) develop a simple regulation model in which an individual\n\npublic project has a fixed value for consumers. A regulator hires a firm to realize the\n\nproject and, if the firm exerts effort, it decreases the cost of the project. The firm can\n\nbe more or less efficient in cost reduction and, since the effort is not observable for the\n\nregulator and it is costly to the firm, the moral hazard problem arises when the firm\u2019s\n\nefficiency parameter is private information. In this case, the regulator must offer a direct\n\nmechanism to the firm that induces truthful revelation. The mechanism specifies a level\n\nof cost for the project and determines a net monetary transfer to the firm.\n\nLaffont and Tirole (1993) also introduce an investment stage to the problem. In\n\nthis extension, the firm can realize a sunk investment that determines the probability\n\ndistribution for the firm\u2019s efficiency parameter in the production stage. There may be a\n\nparameter of effectiveness of investment and the authors analyze the case where the firm\n\nhas superior information about this parameter.\n\nWe develop a regulation model with two parties, the regulator and a firm. There\n\nare two periods, an exploration stage, when the firm realizes a sunk investment, and,\n\nconditional on discovery, there is a production stage, when oil is extracted by the firm.\n\nWe assume that there may be asymmetric information in both periods: either the firm\u2019s\n\nefficiency in extraction or the effectiveness of the investment in exploration can be private\n\ninformation to the firm. Hence, the regulator must design a mechanism to induce truthful\n\nrevelation about the firm\u2019s private information. We assume that the regulator\u2019s objective\n\nis to maximize the social welfare.\n\nAfter we establish the first-best regulatory outcome under complete information, we\n\ncharacterize optimal regulation under asymmetric information. We conclude that, when\n\nthere is asymmetric information only in the production period, the first-best oucome can\n\nbe implemented and therefore there are no negative effects on welfare. However, when\n\nthere is asymmetric information in the exploration period, the regulator may no longer\n\nachieve the first-best level of welfare. The most interesting case is the one in which\n\nwe assume there is asymmetric information in both periods. In this case, there is an\n\ninteraction between the problems of incentive provision in both periods. We show that\n\n\n\n3\n\nthe level of production cost contracted for the second period is a function of the sunk\n\ninvestment, realized in the first period, and its effectiveness parameter.\n\nWe also provide an example with numerical results. In the example we show that the\n\nSpence-Mirrlees condition (SMC) may not hold. The SMC has been the main assumption\n\nthat allows the characterization of the solution of one-dimensional adverse selection or\n\nhidden information models. It turns out that this condition can be violated in a very\n\nnatural way in our model.\n\nThe rest of work is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and the first-\n\nbest outcome under complete information. Section 3 introduces asymmetric information\n\nto the model. In Section 4 we consider a simple example to provide some quantitative\n\nresults and to compare the different regulatory outcomes. Section 4 also presents an\n\nextention of the example, where the firm\u2019s utility function does not satisfy the Spence-\n\nMirrlees condition (SMC). Finally, Section 5 concludes.\n\n\n\n4\n\n2 The model\n\nWe develop a model of regulation under asymmetric information that reflects some\n\nuncertainties inherent in the oil industry. In our model, the regulator hires a risk neutral\n\noil company to work in a project that, if successful, has a fixed payoff. The firm is\n\nresponsible for exploration and production. Following Aghion and Quesada (2010), there\n\nis one exploration period (T = 0), when the firm makes a sunk investment I, and one\n\nproduction period (T = 1).1 As in their model, the regulator offers a contract to the\n\nfirm in (T = 0) and, after it is accepted, exploration begins. Unlike Aghion and Quesada\n\n(2010), we assume that contracts are enforceable and that there is full commitment, so\n\nthat the regulator cannot change any rules after the contract is signed.\n\nOur model is based on the regulation model with investment in Laffont and Tirole\n\n(1993). We assume that production costs and investment are observable variables for\n\nthe regulator, but there may be asymmetric information about the effectiveness of the\n\ninvestment and about the firm\u2019s efficiency in reducing production costs. As in Laffont and\n\nTirole (1993), we take the accounting convention that the production and investment costs\n\nare reimbursed to the firm by the regulator and we assume that the firm is compensated\n\nby a net monetary transfer t to work for the regulator.\n\nLet the effectiveness of investment be measured by ? ? [?,??] ? B, known by the firm\nat the beginning of period (T = 0). This parameter can represent geological uncertainties\n\nin the area to be explored. For a given pair (?,I), an oil reserve is discovered with\n\nprobability Q(I,?) > 0, increasing and concave in I and in ?, with limI?? Q(I, ??) ? 1,\nand we make the following assumption:2\n\nAssumption 1 Q?I > 0.\n\nWhen ? is private information to the firm, G(\u00b7) is the absolutely continuous function,\nwith density g(\u00b7), that describes the prior of the regulator on the interval [?,??]. We assume\nthat g(?) > 0, for all ? ? B.\n\nThe setting in period (T = 1) is similar to Laffont and Tirole (1993). Conditional\n\non discovery, there is an expected production of 1 unit of petroleum in period (T = 1).\n\nThe production is sold at a price p and the revenue goes to the regulator. The production\n\ncost function is\n\nc = ? ?e (1)\n\nwhere ? ? [?, ??] ? ? is an efficiency parameter, which the firm learns at the beginning of\n1Their general model considers two exploration periods.\n2The sub-index denotes the partial derivative.\n\n\n\n5\n\n(T = 1), and e is the manager\u2019s noncontractible effort, which costs ?(e) monetary units to\n\nthe firm. Function ? is increasing and convex, with ?(0) = 0. The absolutely continuous\n\ncumulative distribution of ? is denoted by F(\u00b7), with density f(\u00b7) > 0.\n\nThe main difference between our model and Laffont and Tirole (1993) is that, instead\n\nof affecting the distribution of ?, investment and its effectiveness parameter ? partially\n\ndetermine the project\u2019s probability of success. Unlike Aghion and Quesada (2010), the\n\ncost of effort in our model is not affected by the sunk investment, and the effort does not\n\nincrease expected production. However, the effort in our model reduces production costs\n\nand therefore increases the net expected revenue of the project. Another difference from\n\nAghion and Quesada (2010) is that they do not consider multiple types in the exploration\n\nperiod or in the production period. In their model, investment completely determines the\n\nprobability of discovery and there is no parameter of efficiency in cost reduction.\n\nWe assume that the regulator\u2019s objective is to maximize the expected social welfare\n\nin period (T = 0). As in Laffont and Tirole (1993), the regulator is a Stackelberg leader\n\nand makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the firm in period (T = 0). The regulator offers\n\na contract (I(?), t0(?),c(?,?), t1(?,?))??? for each type ?, based on the observables t, c\n\nand I. The contract specifies: a level of investment I(?) and a net monetary tranfer t0(?)\n\nin (T = 0); a production cost c(?,?) for each possible parameter ? in (T = 1) (conditional\n\non discovery); a net transfer t1(?,?) for each ? the regulator may observe in (T = 1)\n\n(conditional on discovery). We consider a more general set of contracts than Laffont and\n\nTirole (1993). In their model, the regulator can only give monetary transfers to the firm\n\nin the production period, while we consider another transfer in the the investment stage.\n\nFor a given pair (?,?), the firm\u2019s ex post level of utility in period (T = 1) is\n\nU(?,?) = t1(?,?) ??(e(?,?)) (2)\n\nand, given ?, the firm\u2019s ex ante expected utility when it signs the contract in period\n\n(T = 0) is\n\nU(?) = Q(I(?),?)E?[U(?,?)] + t0(?). (3)\n\nwhere E?[x] =\n? ??\n?\n\n[x]f(?)d?.\n\nWhen the firm accepts the contract in (T = 0), the expected utility U is known,\nbut the ex post utility in period (T = 1) is not, since it depends on success in exploration\n\nand, if oil is discovered, it is a function of the firm\u2019s ?, which is learned in (T = 1).\n\nTo accept the contract, the firm must obtain as least as much utility working for\n\n\n\n6\n\nthe regulator as outside the relationship. The firm\u2019s reservation utility (the level of utility\n\nit obtains if the contract is not signed), is normalized to 0, which leads to the firm\u2019s\n\nindividual rationality (IR) constraint\n\nU(?) ? 0. (IRex ante)\n\nIn the production period (T = 1), if the firm does not work for the regulator its\n\nutility is also 0. Thus, the firm\u2019s ex post IR constraint is\n\nU(?,?) ? 0. (IRex post)\n\nand we consider two possibilities:\n\ni. the firm can commit to produce even if the contract ex post results in a level of utility\n\nbelow its reservation utility in (T = 1);\n\nii. the firm cannot commit to produce in period (T = 1) if it results in a level of utility\n\nbelow its reservation utility.\n\nIn (ii) above, welfare maximization must be subject to the ex post IR constraint.\n\nAs in Laffont and Tirole (1993), let ? > 0 be the shadow cost of public funds. It\n\nmeans that distortionary taxation inflicts a disutility of 1 +? monetary units on taxpayers\n\nfor every monetary unit that goes to the state. Hence, given ? and ?, the aggregate net\n\nsurplus in period (T = 1) is\n\np? (1 + ?)[c(?,?) + t1(?,?)] + U(?,?)\n\nwhich can be written as\n\np? (1 + ?)[? ?e(?,?) + ?(e(?,?))] ??U(?,?).\n\nWe assume that p is large enough, such that it is worth realizing the project even\n\nif the firm\u2019s type in (T = 1) is the most inefficient one, ??. Given ?, the ex post social\n\nwelfare in (T = 0) is\n\n\n\n7\n\nW(?) = Q(I(?),?)E? [p? (1 + ?) (? ?e(?,?) + ?(e(?,?))) ??U(?,?)]\n\n? (1 + ?)I(?) ? ?t0(?,?)\n\nwhich is equivalent to\n\nW(?) = Q(I(?),?)E?[p? (1 + ?)(??e(?,?) + ?(e(?,?)))] ? (1 + ?)I ??U(?). (4)\n\nThe first term in (4) is the expected net revenue of the project (the difference between\n\nthe payoff p and the total cost c+?(e), as perceived by the taxpayers, times the probability\n\nof success Q). The social welfare is the difference between this expected revenue and the\n\ninvestment cost in (T = 0) (as perceived by the taxpayers) plus the firm\u2019s rent above its\n\nreservation utility times the shadow cost of public funds. Although the project\u2019s payoff\n\nand the firm\u2019s utility are equally weighted in the welfare function (4), leaving rent to the\n\nfirm reduces social welfare in the existence of a shadow cost ? > 0.\n\n2.1 First-best\n\nWe first analyze the model under complete information to establish benchmark first-\n\nbest levels of effort and investment and the first-best level of social welfare. The regulatory\n\noutcome in this section results in the highest level of social welfare the regulator can\n\nachieve. In this case, besides the cost c and the investment level I, parameters ? and\n\n? are also observable variables for the regulator. For a given ? in period (T = 0), the\n\nregulator solves\n\nmax\nI(\u00b7),e(\u00b7),U(\u00b7)\n\nQ(I(?),?)E? [p? (1 + ?)(? ?e(?,?) + ?(e(?,?)))]\n\n? (1 + ?)I(?) ? ?U(?)\n\nsubject to an individual rationality constraint, where e(?,?) = ? ? c(?,?).\n\nAs discussed before, we characterize the optimal contracts if welfare maximization\n\nis subject to an ex post individual rationality (IR) constraint or if there is just an ex ante\n\nIR constraint.\n\n\n\n8\n\n2.1.1 No ex post IR constraint\n\nFor a given ? in period (T = 0), the welfare maximization problem is\n\nmax\nI(\u00b7),e(\u00b7),U(\u00b7)\n\nQ(I(?),?)E? [p? (1 + ?) (? ?e(?,?) + ?(e(?,?)))]\n\n? (1 + ?)I(?) ? ?U(?)\n\nsubject to the ex ante IR constraint\n\nU(?) ? 0. (IRex ante)\n\nThe characterization to this program is in the Appendix. The optimal effort solves\n\n??(e(?,?)) = 1 (5)\n\nor\n\ne(?,?) = ???1(1) ? e?,\n\nthe optimal first-best level of investment I?(?) is the solution to\n\nQI(I\n?(?),?)(p? (1 + ?)(E[?] ?e? + ?(e?))) = 1 + ? (6)\n\nand the regulator sets\n\nU(?) = 0. (7)\n\nThis outcome can be implemented in many different ways. In particular, the regu-\n\nlator can set t1(?,?) = ?(e?) and t0(?) = 0, so that the ex post IR constraint is always\n\nsatisfied3.\n\nCondition (5) implies that marginal disutility of effort, ??(e), must be equal to the\n\nmarginal production cost reduction, which is 1. Condition (6) implies that the marginal\n\ncost of investment (as perceived by the taxpayers), 1 + ?, must be equal to the expected\n\nmarginal net revenue of the project. Furthermore, since rents are socially costly, the\n\n3To satisfy the ex post IR constraint and to give the firm the utility U(?) = 0, the regulator can set\nt1(?,?) = ?(e?) + a(?) and t0(?) = ?Q(I(?),?)a(?), with a(?) ? 0.\n\n\n\n9\n\nregulator leaves no rent to the firm, i.e., condition (7) holds.\n\n2.1.2 Ex post IR constraint\n\nWe now assume that the firm cannot commit to produde if, given the realization of\n\n?, the contract results in negative utility in period (T = 1). The firm\u2019s utility in period\n\n(T = 1) as a function of its true parameters ? and ? is U(?,?) = t1(?,?) ? ?(e(?,?)),\nand the ex post IR constraint is\n\nU(?,?) ? 0. (IRex post)\n\nIn this case, for a given ? in period (T = 0), the welfare maximization problem is\n\nmax\nI(\u00b7),e(\u00b7),U(\u00b7),t0(\u00b7)\n\nQ(I(?),?)E? [p? (1 + ?)(? ?e(?,?) + ?(e(?,?))) ??U(?,?)]\n\n?(1 + ?)I(?) ??t0(?)\n\nsubject to (IRex ante) and (IRex post).\n\nThe solution to this program is\n\ne(?,?) = e?\n\nI(?) = I?(?)\n\nU(?,?) = 0\n\nt0(?) = 0\n\nwhich implies that U(?) = 0, i.e., no rent is left to the firm.\n\nThus, the optimal regulatory outcome if we consider ex ante or ex post IR constraints\n\nis the same. As noted before, the solution to the this program is a particular solution of\n\nthe welfare maximization problem when it is not subject to the ex post IR constraint.\n\nWe summarize our results in the next proposition.\n\nProposition 1 Optimal regulation under complete information is characterized by (5),\n\n(6), and (7).\n\nOptimal regulation entails:\n\n\n\n10\n\ni. an increasing level of investment in ?;\n\nii. a constant level of effort and increasing costs in ?;\n\niii. no rent for the firm.\n\nFor each pair of parameters (?,?), the pair (I?(?),e?) represents the first-best levels\n\nof investment and effort in our model.\n\n\n\n11\n\n3 Asymmetric information\n\nIn this section we add asymmetric information to the model. As discussed before,\n\nthe firm may not be able to commit to produce if the contract ex post results in a level\n\nof utility below its reservation utility level in (T = 1). Therefore, we consider that the\n\nmaximization problem may be subject either to ex ante or to ex post individual rationality\n\n(IR) constraints. In each setting we analyze three different cases:\n\n\u2022 Case (?): ? is private information to the firm and ? is common knowledge;\n\n\u2022 Case (?): ? is common knowledge and ? is private information to the firm;\n\n\u2022 Case (?,?): both parameters are private information to the firm.\n\nIf any parameter is not observable by the regulator, a direct mechanism that induces\n\ntruthful revelation must be offered to the firm. Thus, the regulator offers a direct mecha-\n\nnism\n(\nI(??), t0(??),c(??, ??), t1(??, ??)\n\n)\n(??,??)??\u00d7B\n\n. If the firm accepts the mechanism, it makes\n\nan announcement ?? of its parameter in period (T = 0), then it realizes an investment I(??)\n\nand receives a net monetary tranfer t0(??). Conditional on discovery, the firm announces\n\n?? in period (T = 1) and produces at a cost c(??, ??), receiving a net transfer t1(??, ??). From\n\nthe Revelation Principle, there is no loss of generality in restricting the regulator to direct\n\nand truthful mechanisms.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s optimization problem must be subject to the incentive compatibility\n\n(IC) constraints, which ensure that the firm truthfully reveals its type. Let the firm\u2019s true\n\nparameter in (T = 0) be ? and suppose that the efficiency parameter in the production\n\nperiod is ? and the announced one is ??. The firm\u2019s utility in (T = 1) is\n\n?(?, ??,?) ? t1(??,?) ??(? ? c(??,?)) (8)\n\nand the utility conditional on truth-telling is\n\nU(?,?) = ?(?,?,?). (9)\n\nThus, for each pair (?,?), the IC constrains are\n\n? ? arg max\n????\n\n?(?, ??,?) (IC1)\n\nand\n\n? ? arg max\n???B\n\nQ(I(??),?)E?[U(?, ??)] + t0(??). (IC0)\n\n\n\n12\n\nWe say that a contract is implementable if it satisfies the IR and IC constraints.\n\nOur goal is to characterize the optimal regulatory mechanism under asymmetric\n\ninformation and to analyze the trade-off between incentives and rent extraction. The\n\nregulator must provide incentives for truth-telling about the firm\u2019s parameters, but giving\n\nrent to the firm is socially costly. Furthermore, we want to analyze the incentives schemes\n\nused by the regulator when each parameter is private information, and how is the inter-\n\naction between incentive provision in the exploration period and in the production period\n\nwhen there is asymmetric information in both periods. We compare the social welfare in\n\neach case with the benchmark first-best level of welfare.\n\n3.1 Ex post IR constraint\n\nWe first characterize the optimal regulatory outcome when the firm cannot commit\n\nto produce if its ex post utility is lower than its reservation utility level for a bad realization\n\nof ? in period (T = 1).\n\n3.1.1 Private information about ?\n\nSuppose that the efficiency parameter ? is common knowledge in period (T = 1),\n\nbut parameter ? is private information to the firm in period (T = 0). In this case,\n\nthe regulator offers a mechanism\n(\nI(??), t0(??),c(?, ??), t1(?, ??)\n\n)\n(?,??)??\u00d7B\n\nin (T = 0). The\n\nmechanism determines a level of investment and a monetary transfer t0 in (T = 0) for\n\neach announcement ?? the firm makes about its parameter, and for each ?? and each true\n\nparamenter ? the regulator may observe in (T = 1), it specifies a level of production cost\n\nand a net transfer t1.\n\nLet the firm be ex ante type ?. The firm\u2019s expected utility is given by\n\nU(?) = sup\n???B\n\nQ(I(??),?)E?[U(?, ??)] + t0(??). (10)\n\nThe regulator\u2019s maximization problem is now subject to the ex post IR and the IC\n\nconstraint for ?.

(IRex post)\n\nIt is straightforward to see that the first-best regulatory outcome can be achieved\n\nand therefore it is the solution to this program. The regulator can implement the first-\n\nbest level of effort e? and set t1(?,?) = ?(e?), so that the firm has a fixed ex post utility\n\nU(?,?) = 0. In this case, we prove in the Appendix that the sufficient conditions for IC\n\nin period (T = 0) are\n\nU?(?) = Q?(I(?),?)E?[U(?,?)] (IC0.a)\n\nand\n\nI?(?) ? 0. (IC0.b)\n\nIf the firm\u2019s expected utility in (T = 1) is 0, condition (IC0.a) is satisfied for every\n\nlevel of investment and the regulator can implement I?(?), which is increasing in ? and\n\nsatisfies condition (IC0.b). Thus, the firm\u2019s ex ante expected utility is U(?) = t0(?),\nand the regulator optimally sets t0(?) = 0, leaving no rent to the firm. The result is\n\nsummarized in:\n\nProposition 2 If ? is observable by the regulator and ? is private information to the\n\nfirm, the optimal mechanism achieves the first-best level of welfare when the regulator\n\nfaces an ex post IR constraint.\n\nIt is the assumption that the firm\u2019s reservation utility in period (T = 1) is 0 that\n\nallows the regulator to achieve the first-best oucome. By Assumption 1, the marginal\n\nreturn of investment is increasing in ?, and therefore the regulator wants to implement\n\nan increasing I(?) when there is complete information. When ? is not observable for the\n\nregulator and firm\u2019s reservation utility in the production period is 0, for every announce-\n\n\n\n14\n\nment ?? the firm can make in period (T = 0), its expected utility in period (T = 1) is\n\nE?[U(?, ??)] = 0. Hence, the firm has nothing to gain by misrepresenting its type and\nthe regulator can implement the first-best level of investment, without having to leave\n\nrent to the firm. However, as we show in Subsection 3.3, the result does not hold if the\n\nreservation utility is positive in (T = 1).\n\n3.1.2 Private information about ?\n\nThis setting is the opposite of the previous one. We now suppose that the parameter\n\nof effectiveness of investment, ?, is an observable variable for the regulator in period\n\n(T = 0). However, in period (T = 1) the firm has private information about the parameter\n\nof efficiency in cost reduction, ?. In this case, for each true parameter ? the regulator\n\noffers a direct mechanism\n(\nI(?), t0(?),c(??,?), t1(??,?)\n\n)\n????\n\nin (T = 0), which specifies a\n\nlevel of investment and a net monetary transfer t0 in (T = 0), and a level of production\n\ncost and another net monetary transfer t1 for each announcement ?? the firm can make in\n\n(T = 1).\n\nLet the firm\u2019s true parameter in (T = 0) be ? and suppose that the efficiency\n\nparameter in the production period is ? and the announced one is ??. The firm\u2019s utility in\n\n(T = 1) is given by equation (8), and the level of utility the firm obtains by truth-telling\n\nis U(?,?), defined in (9). The following lemma characterizes incentive compatibility in\n\nthis setting.\n\nLemma 1 For a given ? a pair of piecewise differentiable functions U(\u00b7,?) and c(\u00b7,?) is\nincentive compatible if and only if\n\nU?(?,?) = ??? (e (?,?)) (IC1.a)\n\nand\n\nc?(?,?) ? 0, (IC1.b)\n\nwhere c(?,?) = ? ?e(?,?), U? ? ?U/??, and c? ? ?c/??.\n\nProof: See Proposition 1.1 in Laffont and Tirole (1993).\n\nAs defined before, the firm\u2019s expected utility in period (T = 0) is\n\nU(?) = Q(I(?),?)E?[U(?,?)] + t0(?)\n\nand, for a given ?, the social welfare in period (T = 0) is\n\n\n\n15\n\nW(?) = Q(I(?),?)E?\n[\np? (1 + ?) (c(?,?) + ?(e(?,?))) ??U(?,?)\n\n]\n? (1 + ?)I(?) ? ?t0(?).\n\nThe regulator\u2019s maximization problem is now subject to the ex post IR and the IC\n\nconstraints. The regulator solves\n\nmax\nI(\u00b7),e(\u00b7),U(\u00b7),t0(\u00b7)\n\nQ(I(?),?)E?\n[\np? (1 + ?)(? ?e(?,?) + ?(e(?,?))) ??U(?,?)\n\n]\n? (1 + ?)I(?) ? ?t0(?)\n\nsubject to\n\nU(?) ? 0 (IRex ante)\n\nU(?,?) ? 0 (IRex post)\n\nU?(?,?) = ??? (e (?,?)) (IC1.a)\n\ne?(?,?) ? 1 (IC1.b? )\n\nwhere constraint (IC1.b? ) is equivalent to (IC1.b) with e? ? ?e/??. Since U? &lt;0, condition\n(IRex post) is satisfied if U(??,?) ? 0, and the regulator optimally sets U(??,?) = 0, for\nall ? ? B.\n\nAs in the previous case, the regulator can achieve the first-best regulatory outcome if\n\nthere is asymmetric information in the production period. The optimal investment I?(?)\n\ncan be implemented, since ? is observed by the regulator. If the regulator implements\n\nthe constant first-best effort e?, the monotonicity condition (IC1.b? ) is satisfied. Then, to\n\nsatisfy condition (IC1.a), the regulator must set t\n1(?,?) such that U?(?,?) = ???(e?) = ?1.\n\nThus, if the regulator sets\n\nt0(?) = ?Q(I?(?),?)E?[U(?,?)]\n\nthe firms expected utility in period (T = 0) is U(?) = 0, and the regulator leaves no rent\nto the firm.\n\nWe summarize the result in the following proposition:\n\nProposition 3 If ? is observable by the regulator and ? is private information to the\n\nfirm, the optimal mechanism achieves the first-best level of welfare when the regulator\n\n\n\n16\n\nfaces an ex post IR constraint.\n\nThe firm\u2019s utility the production period, U(?,?) must be decreasing in ? to induce\n\ntruthful revelation about that parameter. Since the firm does not work for the regulator\n\nif it obtains negative utility in (T = 1), the regulator must give positive utility to the\n\nfirm if it is type ? &lt;??. However, the positive expected utility in the production period is\n\ncompensated by a negative monetary transfer to the regulator in the investment period.\n\nThus, the regulator leaves no rent to the firm.\n\nIn Laffont and Tirole (1993) it is not possible to achieve the first-best outcome\n\nwhen there is asymmetric information in the production stage. We consider a broader\n\nset of transfers, allowing the regulator to give a net (negative) transfer to the firm in the\n\ninvestment stage. The possibility to make transfers to the firm in the investment stage is\n\nthe key to achieve the first-best outcome.\n\nNote that, for bad realizations of the parameter ?, the utility the firm obtains in\n\nperiod (T = 1) is not enough to compensate for the payment (?t0) it makes to the\nregulator in the investment period. We assume that in period (T = 1), once the payment\n\nto the regulator is a sunk cost, the firm always produces if it results in a level of utility\n\nU(?,?) above its reservation utility. If we assume, however, that the firm\u2019s \u201ceffective\u201d ex\n\npost level of utility U(?,?) +t0(?) cannot be lower than the firm\u2019s reservation utility level,\n\nthen the first-best is not achieved.\n\n3.1.3 Private information about ? and ?\n\nIn this subsection we present our most interesting result. We suppose that the\n\nparameters ? and ? are not observable for the regulator. In this case, the regulator offers\n\na direct mechanism\n(\nI(??), t0(??),c(??, ??), t1(??, ??)\n\n)\n(??,??)??\u00d7B\n\nin period (T = 0), where ??\n\ndenotes the firm\u2019s announcement of its parameter in (T = 0) and ?? denotes the possible\n\nannouncement the firm can make in the production period (T = 1). As in the previous\n\nsubsection, incentive compatibility in the production period is determined by Lemma 1.\n\nLet the firm be ex ante type ?. The firm\u2019s expected utility in period (T = 0) is\n\nU(?) = sup\n???B\n\nQ(I(??),?)E?[U(?, ??)] + t0(??).\n\nFrom the envelope theorem, the IC constraint in (T = 0) implies\n\nU?(?) = Q?(I(?),?)E?[U(?,?)]. (IC0.a)\n\n\n\n17\n\nIn Lemma 3 in the appendix, we prove that, in addition to the first-order condition (IC0.a),\n\ntwo monotonicity constraints are sufficient for IC in period (T = 0). Since U? ? 0, the ex\nante IR constraint must be satisfied at the least efficient type. The ex ante IR constraint\n\nis accordingly\n\nU(?) ? 0. (IRex ante)\n\nThus, the regulator\u2019s relaxed problem, without considering the firm\u2019s second-order\n\ncondition (SOC), is\n\nmax\nI(\u00b7),e(\u00b7),U(\u00b7)\n\n? ??\n?\n\n{\nQ(I(?),?)E?\n\n[\np?

(IC1.a)\n\ne?(?,?) ? 1 (IC1.b? )\n\nU?(?) = Q?(I(?),?)E?[U(?,?)]. (IC0.a)\n\nAs noted before, since U? &lt;0, the regulator sets U(??,?) = 0, for all ? ? B. Integrat-\ning by parts and using conditions (IC0.a) and (IC1.a), the rent that the regulator expects\n\nto give to the firm is\n\n? ??\n?\n\nU(?)g(?)d? = U(?) +\n? ??\n?\n\n(1 ?G(?))Q?(I(?),?)E?[U(?,?)]d?\n\n=\n\n? ??\n?\n\n(1 ?G(?))Q?(I(?),?)\n\n[? ??\n?\n\n??(e(?,?))F(?)d?\n\n]\nd?\n\nusing the fact that the regulator optimally sets U(?) = 0.

(most efficient type in petroleum exploration).\n\nThe optimal investment level is I1(?) ? I?(?), with equality only at ? = ??. Note that, if\nthe firm is type ? = ?? in the exploration period, the regulator implements the first-best\n\nlevels of effort and investment, but since it has to leave rent to the firm, the level of welfare\n\nis below the first-best.\n\nAs in Laffont and Tirole (1993), we make an assumption to ensure that in an interior\n\nmaximum e? ? 0 and constraint IC1.b? is satisfied.\n\nAssumption 2 d\nd?\n\n[F(?)/f(?)] ? 0, for ? ? [?,?].\n\nWe will check the SOC of the welfare maximization and the firm\u2019s problems in the\n\nExample in Section 4. The results above are summarized in:\n\nProposition 4 If incentive compatibility in the exploration period and the second-order\n\nconditions of the regulator\u2019s problem are satisfied, and if Assumption 2 is valid, the\n\noptimal mechanism in this case is characterized by (11), (12), (IC0.a), (IC1.a), (IC1.b? ),\n\nU(??,?) = 0 for all ? ? B, and U(?) = 0.\n\nThe optimal mechanism entails:\n\ni. an efficient level of effort if the firm is either type ? in period (T = 1) or if it was type\n\n?? in period (T = 0);\n\nii. undereffort if the firm is type ? > ? in (T = 1) and if it was type ? &lt;?? in (T = 0);\n\n\n\n19\n\niii. optimal level of investment for ? = ??;\n\niv. underinvestment for ? &lt;??.\n\nThe most interesting feature of the optimal mechanism is that, although the invest-\n\nment and its effectiveness parameter ? do not affect the production or its costs ? + c in\n\nperiod (T = 1), the optimal level of effort e1 is a function of both ? and the sunk invest-\n\nment I. The regulator is using the effort level contracted for period (T = 1) as part of the\n\nincentive scheme to induce truth-telling about ? in period (T = 0). Since we assume that\n\nthe investment cost is reimbursed to the firm, it wants the highest level of investment\n\nto maximize its expected utility, therefore it has an incentive to misrepresent its type.\n\nTo induce truthful revelation the regulator ajusts the effort level contracted for period\n\n(T = 1) to impose a cost to the firm. However, if the firm\u2019s type is the efficient ?? in the\n\nexploration period, the regulator implements the first-best level of effort, regardless of the\n\nfirm\u2019s type in the production period. In this case, we have an additional \u201cno distortion at\n\nthe top\u201d result, which is the first-best level of effort for the firms with type ?? in (T = 0).\n\n3.2 No ex post IR constraint\n\nIn this subsection we suppose that the firm can commit to produce in period (T = 1),\n\neven if the contract ex post involves negative utility. The following proposition summarizes\n\nour results, and the proof is in the Appendix.\n\nProposition 5 If the welfare maximization problem is not subject to an ex post IR\n\nconstraint, the regulator can always achieve the first-best level of welfare under asymmetric\n\ninformation.\n\nThere is a similar result in Laffont and Tirole (1993), in the setting where there is\n\nno asymmetric information in the investment period. They explain that rent extraction\n\nis not relevant because the contract is signed under symmetric information. When the\n\ncontract is signed, the efficiency parameter related to effort is not know by the firm, and\n\nthe two parties have the same information about its probability distribution. If there is\n\nno ex post IR constraint, the regulator can leave no rent to the firm. We prove that the\n\nresult holds in our model even if the effectiveness of investment is private information to\n\nthe firm.\n\nIn the settings where ? is private information to the firm, the firm\u2019s utility the\n\nproduction period, U(?,?) must be decreasing in ? to induce truthful revelation about\n\nthat parameter. If there is an ex post IR constraint, the regulator must give positive utility\n\nto the firm if it is type ? &lt;??. In the absence of ex post IR constraints, the regulator can\n\ngive negative utility to the inefficient types (high ?). Thus, the positive utility if the firm\n\nhas a low ? in period (T = 1) is compensated by negative utility it can get if it turns\n\n\n\n20\n\nout to be inefficient in cost reduction, so that its expected utility in (T = 1) is 0. The\n\nincentive compatibility constraint in (T = 0) is\n\nU?(?) = Q?(I(?),?)E?[U(?,?)] (IC0.a)\n\nand when the expected utility is E?[U(?,?)] = 0, the regulator can satisfy (IC0.a) and leave\nno rent to the firm. It is the possibility to make transfers such that the firm has negative\n\nutility in period (T = 1) that allows the regulator to achieve the first-best outcome under\n\nincomplete information, when ? and ? are private information to the firm. Although the\n\nregulator bears all the exploration risks by reimbursing the investment cost, if there is no\n\nex post IR constraint the production risks can be shared with the firm.\n\nFor the setting in which ? is private information and ? is common knowledge, we\n\nhave seen before that the regulator can achieve the first-best regulatory outcome when\n\nwelfare maximization is subject to an ex post IR constraint. This is possible because the\n\nregulator can set the firm\u2019s expected utility in (T = 1) to be 0. If just ? is observed by the\n\nregulator, it is also possible to achieve the first-best regulatory outcome in the presence\n\nof an ex post IR constraint. When the maximization is subject to a more flexible ex ante\n\nIR constraint, it is straightforward to see that the regulator can also achieve the first-best\n\noutcome when just ? or just ? are not obsevable. Thus, we have the following:\n\nCorollary The existence of asymmetric information in just one of the periods does not\n\naffect welfare.\n\n3.3 Positive reservation utility\n\nSo far we have assumed that the firm\u2019s reservation utility in the production period\n\n(T = 1) is the same as in period (T = 0), which is normalized to 0. In this subsection\n\nwe briefly analyze the regulatory outcome if the reservation utility is a general constant.\n\nWe suppose that outside the relationship with the regulator the firm can obtain a level of\n\nutility u? > 0 in both periods. The only case where the results do not hold is Case (?,IRep)\n\nin Subsection 3.1.1, in which ? is private information to the firm in the exploration period,\n\nbut ? is common knowledge, and there is an ex post IR constraint.\n\nThe first-best levels of effort and investment remain unchanged, but the regulator\n\nsets U(?) = u?, for all ? ? B. In case both ? and ? are private information to the firm, the\nqualitative results are the same. When there is asymmetric information in the production\n\nperiod about ?, but ? is common knowledge, the regulator can still achieve the first-best\n\nregulatory outcome, even if there is as ex post IR constraint. However, when ? is private\n\ninformation to the firm and ? is observable for both parties, the regulator can no longer\n\n\n\n21\n\nachieve the first best outcome if there is an ex post IR constraint. In this case, the\n\nregulator\u2019s optimization problem is\n\nmax\nI(\u00b7),e(\u00b7),U(\u00b7)\n\n? ??\n?\n\n{\nQ(I(?),?)E? [p? (1 + ?) (? ?e(?,?) + ?(e(?,?)))]\n\n?

(IRex post)\n\nSince there is no asymmetric information in the production period, the regulator\n\noptimally sets U(?,?) = u?, for every ? ? B. In this case, we have the following lemma:\n\nLemma 2 For every ? ? B a pair of piecewise differentiable functions U(\u00b7) and I(\u00b7) is\nincentive compatible if and only if\n\nU?(?) = Q?(I(?),?)E?[U(?,?)] (IC0.a)\n\nand\n\nI?(?) ? 0. (IC0.b)\n\nProof: See the Appendix.\n\nIntegrating by parts and using condition (IC0.a), the expected rent that the regulator\n\ngives to the firm is\n\n? ??\n?\n\nU(?)g(?)d? = u? +\n? ??\n?\n\n(1 ?G(?))Q?(I(?),?)E?[U(?,?)]d? (13)\n\n\n\n22\n\nsince the regulator optimally sets U(?) = u?. Thus, the regulator solves\n\nmax\nI(\u00b7),e(\u00b7),U(\u00b7)\n\n? ??\n?\n\n{\nQ(I(?),?)E? [p? (1 + ?)

(1 + ?)[? ?e? + ?(e?)]]f(?)d? =(1 + ?)\n\n+ ?\n(1 ?G(?))\n\ng(?)\nQ?I(I?(?),?)u?\n\nand I?(?) ? I?(?) (with equality only at ? = ??), since u? > 0. The level of investment\nI?(?) is implementable if it is increasing in ?.\n\nFor a given expected utility u? > 0 in (T = 1), the incentive compatibility constraint\n\n(IC0.a) becomes U?(?) = Q?(I(?),?)u?. Thus, the regulator must leave rent to the higher\ntypes to induce truthful revelation about ?. In the absence of an ex post IR constraint,\n\nthe regulator can set u? = 0 and the IC constraint is satisfied without the need to leave\n\nrent to the firm, and hence the regulator achieves the first-best outcome.\n\n3.4 Results\n\nWhen the regulator does not have to satisfy the firm\u2019s ex post IR constraint, the\n\nexistence of asymmetric information has no effect on welfare. Even if there is an ex post IR\n\nconstraint, the mechanism we consider is complete enough to allow the regulator to achieve\n\nthe first-best outcome when there is only asymmetric information in the production period.\n\nHowever, when ? is not observable in the investment stage, the regulator may no longer\n\nbe able implement the first-best outcome when the firm has an ex post IR constraint.\n\n\n\n23\n\nIf ? is private information to the firm, but ? is common knowledge in the production\n\nperiod, the regulator cannot implement the first-best regulatory outcome if the firm\u2019s\n\nreservation utility in (T = 1) is positive. The existence of an outside option that gives a\n\npositive utility to the firm forces the regulator to leave rent to the firm to induce truthful\n\nrevelation. In this case, it is the firm\u2019s exogenous outside option in the production period\n\nthat prevents the regulator from implementing the first-best outcome. When we assume\n\nthat the firm\u2019s outside option gives it a level of utility u? = 0, the first-best outcome can\n\nstill be implemented.\n\nWhen both ? and ? are not observable to the regulator, the first-best outcome\n\ncannot be implemented, even if we assume that the firm\u2019s reservation utility is 0 in period\n\n(T = 1). In this case, since there is asymmetric information in the production period,\n\nthe regulator must give a positive level of utility to the lower (efficient) types ? in period\n\n(T = 1) to induce truth-telling. If the firm\u2019s ex post IR constraint has to be satisfied and\n\nthere is positive utility left to the lower types, then the regulator must leave a positive\n\nexpected utility to the firm in the production period. This endogenous expected utility\n\nhas the same effect as the exogenous positive reservation utility, forcing the regulator\n\nto leave rent to the efficient types in the exploration period (T = 0) to induce truthful\n\nrevelation about ?.\n\n\n\n24\n\n4 An example\n\nIn the previous section, we characterized the optimal regulatory outcome under\n\nasymmetric information. In this section, we develop a simple example for our model to\n\nprovide some numerical results. Furthermore, we check the second-order conditions of the\n\nregulator\u2019s problem in Subsection 3.1.3, and we use Lemma 3 in the Appendix to check\n\nthat the solution satisfies incentive compatibity in period (T = 0). Our objective is to\n\nquantify the effects of asymmetric information on the optimal regulatory outcome and on\n\nthe social welfare.\n\nWe assume that the shadow cost of public funds is ? = 0.1, that the expected oil\n\nprice is p = 5 and that the firm\u2019s reservation utility in both periods is 0. We consider the\n\nfollowing intervals for parameters ? and ?:\n\n? ? [0.7, 0.9]\n\n? ? [1, 2]\n\nand we assume the cumulative distributions are uniform. The interval for ? is chosen in\n\na way that is always worth producing, even for a bad realization of the parameters, and\n\nthe uniform distribution satisfies Assumption 2. The choice of interval for ? is relevant\n\nto ensure that Q?I(I,?) > 0 and that Assumption 1 is satisfied. Furthermore, we assume\n\nthat the cost function of effort is\n\n?(e) =\ne2\n\n2\n(14)\n\nand that the probability of discovery is given by\n\nQ(I,?) = 1 ?\nexp(?I?)\n\n2\n. (15)\n\nNote that Q?I(I,?) = [exp(?I?)/2][1?I?]. For the relevant set of parameters, Q?I\nis always positive and Assumption 1 is satisfied. However, if the level of investment and\n\nits effectiveness ? are high enough, the sign of the cross derivative may be negative. We\n\ndiscuss this case in Subsection 4.2.\n\n4.1 Numerical results\n\nWhen the firm\u2019s reservation utility is 0, the only case where the regulator cannot\n\nachieve the first-best outcome is:\n\n\n\n25\n\n\u2022 Case (?,?,IRep): asymmetric information in the exploration and in the production\nperiods and the existence of an ex post IR constraint.\n\nWe summarize the main features of the two different outcomes, First-best and Case\n\n(?,?,IRep).\n\n4.1.1 Effort\n\nThe first-best level of effort is e? = 1. As discussed before, in Case (?,?,IRep) the\n\noptimal level of effort e1 is a function of both ? and ?. To induce truthful revelation in\n\nperiod (T = 0) about ?, the average level of effort the regulator implements in period\n\n(T = 1), e?1, is depicted in Figure 1. The average level of effort is increasing in ? and, as\n\ndiscussed before, if the firm\u2019s type is ?? = 1, the regulator implements the first-best effort\n\nin (T = 1), regardless of the firm\u2019s ex post type ?.\n\nFigure 1: Average effort e?1.\n\n4.1.2 Investment\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the first-best level of investment I? is increasing and concave\n\nin ?. In Case (?,?,IRep), the optimal level of investment I\n1 is increasing in ? and there\n\nis underinvestment except for ? = 1. To evaluate how serious is the underinvestment, we\n\ndefine the ratio\n\nRI1(?) =\nI1(?)\n\nI?(?)\n. (16)\n\nFigure 3 depicts the proportion of investment in Case (?,?,IRep) relative to the first-\n\nbest, RI1. As ? increases RI1 gets closer to 1, and reaches it for ? = 1. We also verified\n\n\n\n26\n\nthat that the firm\u2019s expected utility in period (T = 1), E?[U(?,?)], is increasing, thus, by\nLemma 3 in the Appendix, we know that the solution in Case (?,?,IRep) is implementable.\n\nFigure 2: First-best level of investment.\n\nFigure 3: Investment relative to the first-best.\n\n4.1.3 Welfare\n\nThe expected social welfare in period (T = 0) is increasing in ?. In Case (?,?,IRep)\n\nthe welfare W 1 is always below the first-best level of social welfare W?, shown in Figure\n\n4. As parameter ? increases, the effort implemented in Case (?,?,IRep) gets closer to the\n\nfirst-best e? and the investment I1 approaches I?. Thus, W 1 gets closer to the first-best\n\nW? when ? approaches 1, although the rent left to the firm is increasing in ?. however,\n\n\n\n27\n\nsince the regulator must leave rent to the firm, the level of welfare W 1 does not reach the\n\nfirst-best W?.\n\nFigure 4: Welfare.\n\n4.2 Violating the Spence-Mirrlees condition\n\nAccording to Araujo and Moreira (2010), the single-crossing or Spence-Mirrlees con-\n\ndition (SMC) has been the the main assumption that allows us to fully characterize the\n\nsolution of one-dimensional adverse selection or hidden information models.4 We say that\n\nthe SMC holds if the the preferences of the privately informed part are such that the\n\nmarginal rates of substitution between a decision variable and money are increasing with\n\nrespect to a one-dimensional parameter or type. Under the SMC, the implementable de-\n\ncisions are non-decreasing in type. In this subsection, we provide an example in which\n\nthe SMC condition is violated, but we do not solve the regulator\u2019s problem.\n\nSuppose that ? is private information to the firm and ? is observable for the regulator,\n\nand that there is an ex post IR constraint. Let u? > 0 be the firm\u2019s reservation utility\n\nin both periods. We solved the regulator\u2019s welfare maximization problem for this case\n\nin Subsection 3.3. As discussed before, in period (T = 1) the regulator optimally sets\n\n4See Schotmuller (2012) for a discussion about the SMC. Mirrlees (1971) is the pioneering reference.\n\n\n\n28\n\nU(?,?) = u? for every ? ? B. Thus, we define\n\nV (I,?,t0) ? Q(I,?)u? + t0 (17)\n\nas the firm\u2019s utility in period (T = 0). In this case the SMC condition is\n\nV?I = Q?Iu? > 0 (18)\n\nwhich holds if Q?I > 0. Thus, Assumption 1 is the SMC in our model.\n\nAs noted before, the cross-derivative in our example is Q?I(I,?) = [exp(?I?)/2][1?\nI?], which can be non-positive. In fact, the SMC condition in this case is violated in\n\na natural way in our model. Since Q represents the probability of discovery, it is a\n\nlimited variable. Thus, when Q is close enough to 1, the marginal effect of an increase\n\nin investment, QI, is decreasing in ?. Hence, when the probability is close to 1, I and\n\n? become substitute inputs to Q.5 The solution when the SMC does not hold can be\n\ncharacterized by using techniques developed in Araujo and Moreira (2010). However, the\n\nanalysis when the SMC is violated is beyond the scope of this work.\n\n5This result holds for several other functional forms for Q.\n\n\n\n29\n\n5 Conclusions\n\nIn this work we characterized the optimal regulation of oil exploration and pro-\n\nduction under asymmetric information. We developed a simple two-period model that\n\nconsiders some important uncertainties in petroleum contracts, focusing on the issues re-\n\nlated to asymmetric information. In Section 3, we proved that the existence of asymmetric\n\ninformation only in the production period is irrelevant, since the regulator can implement\n\nthe first-best outcome.\n\nHowever, when the firm cannot commit to produce for bad realizations of ?, the\n\nexpected level of social welfare decreases in the existence of asymmetric information in\n\nthe exploration period. In this case, the regulator can no longer use the second period\n\nto extract the rent left to the firm when investment was made. Since the firm must be\n\ngiven a minimum level of utility in the production period, the regulator cannot share\n\nrisks with the firm in an efficient way. furthermore, if there is asymmetric information\n\nin both periods, there is an interaction between incentive provision in each period. The\n\neffort contracted to the production period is a function of the investment realized in the\n\nexploration stage and its effectiveness parameter.\n\nWe also provided an example with numerical results. In that example, we pointed\n\nout that the Spence-Mirrlees (SMC) condition can be violated in our model. Moreover,\n\nit turns out that the violation of the SMC is the result of particular characteristics of\n\npetroleum contracts rather than an artificial construction.\n\nThe model can be extended in many directions. The most obvious extension is the\n\ninclusion of more periods. Another possible extension is to analyze the regulation problem\n\nif there is no commitment or if there is poor enforcement. Finally, it would be interesting\n\nto characterize the solution to the model when the SMC does not hold.\n\n\n\n30\n\nReferences\n\nAghion, P. and L.

If the regulator sets\n\nE?[U(?,?)] = 0, then the IC constraint (IC0.a) is satisfied if U?(?) = 0. Hence, the\nregulator optimally sets t0(?) = 0, then U(?) = 0 and, therefore, (IC0.a) is satisfied\nfor every level of investment, with no rent left to the firm. Thus, the regulator\n\ncan implement the first-best investment I?(?), which is increasing in ? an satisfies\n\n(IC0.b), achieving the the first-best regulatory outcome.\n\nThere are many ways to implement E?[U(?,?)] = 0. In particular, the regulator can\nset t1(?,?) = ?(e?).\n\n\u2022 Private information about ?\n\nIn this case, the regulator\u2019s objective is to maximize the expected social welfare in\n\n(T = 0), subject to the ex ante individual rationality and the incentive compatibility\n\nconstraints.

(IRex ante)\n\n\n\n36\n\nIt is straightforward to see that the first-best regulatory outcome can be achieved\n\nand therefore it is the solution to this welfare maximization problem. If the regulator\n\nsets and I(?) = I?(?) and e(?,?) = e?, condition (IC1.b? ) is satisfied. The regulator\n\ncan set t1(?,?), such that (IC1.a) is also satisfied and that E?[U(?,?)] = 0, and\nt0(?) = 0. Thus, the firm\u2019s expected utility is always 0, and the regulator leaves no\n\nrent to the firm. Condition (IC1.a) determines that the firm\u2019s utility in (T = 1) is\n\nstrictly decreasing in ?, therefore the firm gets negative utility if its type is inefficient\n\nin cost reduction (high ?).\n\n\u2022 Private information about ? and ?\n\nIf we assume that there is just an ex ante IR constraint, the regulator solves\n\nmax\nI(\u00b7),e(\u00b7),U(\u00b7)\n\n? ??\n?\n\n{\nQ(I(?),?)E?

(IRex ante)\n\nIt is straightforward to see that the first-best regulatory outcome can be achieved and\n\nit is the solution to this program. If the regulator sets I(?) = I?(?), which is increasing\n\nin ?, and e(?,?) = e?, conditions (IC0.b) and (IC1.b? ) are satisfied. The regulator can set\n\nt1(?,?) such that (IC1.a) is also satisfied and that E?[U(?,?)] = 0, which ensures that\ncondition (IC0.a) is satisfied. If the regulator also sets t\n\n0(?) = 0, the ex ante IR is always\n\nbinding and no rent is left to the firm. Note that, if (IC0.a) and (IC0.b) are sufficient\n\nconditions for incentive compatibility in period (T = 0) when E?[U(?,?)] = 0.\n\nAs in the setting where just ? is private information to the firm, the negative utility\n\nthe firm expects to get if it turns out to be a high ? type in (T = 1) compensates the\n\npositive utility of the low ? types. For every announcement ?? of its parameter in (T = 0),\n\nthe firm has the same expected utility (E?[U(?, ??)] = 0) and therefore it is indifferent\nbetween truth-telling and lying. As before, it is the absence of ex post IR constraint and\n\nthe possibility to give the firm negative utility in period (T = 1) that allows the regulator\n\nto achieve the first-best outcome under incomplete information.\n\n\n\tIntroduction\n\tThe model\n\tFirst-best\n\tNo ex post IR constraint\n\tEx post IR constraint\n\n\n\tAsymmetric information\n\tEx post IR constraint\n\tPrivate information about \n\tPrivate information about \n\tPrivate information about  and \n\n\tNo ex post IR constraint\n\tPositive reservation utility\n\tResults\n\n\tAn example\n\tNumerical results\n\tEffort\n\tInvestment\n\tWelfare\n\n\tViolating the Spence-Mirrlees condition\n\n\tConclusions\n\tReferences\n\tAppendix"}]}}}
