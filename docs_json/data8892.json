As caracter\u00edsticas de dep\u00f3sitos de paleotsunamis podem \n\nvariar de local para local com as caracter\u00edsticas geomorfol\u00f3gicas e sedimentol\u00f3gicas do sector costeiro em \n\nan\u00e1lise, bem como, com a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o e/ou eros\u00e3o associadas \u00e0 inunda\u00e7\u00e3o e ao retorno das ondas. Estes \n\nfactores tornam o reconhecimento de paleotsunamis, numa sequ\u00eancia sedimentar, uma tarefa ousada. \n\nAl\u00e9m de que, existem tamb\u00e9m variad\u00edssimas similaridades entre dep\u00f3sitos sedimentares de tsunamis e de \n\ntempestades, o que pode restringir de sobremaneira a precis\u00e3o no seu reconhecimento e, \n\nconsequentemente, na determina\u00e7\u00e3o de per\u00edodos de retorno para invas\u00f5es marinhas extremas. \n\nEsta trabalho tem como objectivo fundamental contribur para mitigar estas dificuldades, focando-se \n\nsobre a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de an\u00e1lise litoestratigr\u00e1fica, textural, morfosc\u00f3pica, microtextural e de composi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmineral\u00f3gica, para identificar dep\u00f3sitos de inunda\u00e7\u00f5es marinhas extremas e determinar as suas prov\u00e1veis \n\nfontes sedimentares. O trabalho aqui apresentado emerge do estudo de uma variedade de locais (Salgados \n\ne Boca do Rio - Portugal; Lhok Nga - Indon\u00e9sia; Voe of Scatsta e Stoneybridge - Esc\u00f3cia) e considera \n\neventos de diferentes cronologias e fontes distintas (tsunami: AD 1755, 26 de dezembro de 2004 e \n\nStoregga; e a Grande Tempestade, de 11 de Janeiro de 2005) que afectaram, e deixaram registo \n\nsedimentar peculiar, \u00e1reas com diferentes ambientes sedimentares e condi\u00e7\u00f5es oceanogr\u00e1ficas regionais. \n\nOs m\u00e9todos usados nas amostras de cada \u00e1rea de estudo foram: interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o litoestratigr\u00e1fica, \n\ngranulometria, an\u00e1lise e interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o de dados texturais; caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de popula\u00e7\u00f5es sedimentares \n\natrav\u00e9s de an\u00e1lise morfosc\u00f3pica, caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o microtextural de gr\u00e3os de quartzo usando imagens de \n\nmicrosc\u00f3pio electr\u00f3nico de varrimento e estudo das associa\u00e7\u00f5es de minerais pesados. \n\nA costa Sul do Algarve caracteriza-se por um regime de agita\u00e7\u00e3o de baixa energia e \u00e9 raramente \n\nafectada por tsunamis ou tempestades muito intensas. O tsunami mais devastador que afectou a costa \n\nportuguesa em tempos hist\u00f3ricos foi o de 1 de Novembro de 1755. V\u00e1rios estudos discutiram a \n\nsedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o associada a este evento no Algarve em contextos rochosos do Barlavento (Furnas, Barranco, \n\nMartinhal e Boca do Rio) e num \u00fanico caso do Sotavento (Ria Formosa). No presente trabalho descreve-se \n\numa nova ocorr\u00eancia sedimentar detectada na depress\u00e3o dos Salgados (Algarve central) cuja \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o original, enquadramento na sequ\u00eancia de colmata\u00e7\u00e3o holoc\u00e9nica, data\u00e7\u00e3o e origem se \n\napresentam e discutem. A depress\u00e3o dos Salgados localiza-se na ba\u00eda entre Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara e a ponta da \n\nGal\u00e9. Este tro\u00e7o costeiro cont\u00e9m uma praia arenosa interm\u00e9dia-reflectiva com 6 km de comprimento, \n\nmarginada por um cord\u00e3o dunar m\u00faltiplo, vegetado (cota apical entre 3 e 17m acima do n\u00edvel m\u00e9dio do \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nII \n \n\nmar), que reveste um afloramento alongado de beachrock e eolianitos holoc\u00e9nicos. Obtiveram-se 145 \n\nsondagens curtas (&lt;1.5m) e 13 \u201clongas\u201d (2 a 4.5m), no enchimento sedimentar da Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\nOnze amostras de lodo org\u00e2nico foram datadas por 14C e um testemunho sujeito a an\u00e1lise de 210Pb e 137Cs. \n\nFoi poss\u00edvel caracterizar 6 unidades litoestratigr\u00e1ficas fundamentais, acumuladas na segunda metade do \n\nHoloc\u00e9nico ao abrigo de uma barreira j\u00e1 estabelecida e contempor\u00e2neas de um n\u00edvel do mar pr\u00f3ximo do \n\nactual. As unidades denominadas A, B e a C, depositadas p\u00f3s ca. 5900 BP s\u00e3o constitu\u00eddas por areias com \n\nintercala\u00e7\u00f5es vasosas e vasas com intercala\u00e7\u00f5es arenosas, com transi\u00e7\u00e3o lateral de f\u00e1cies frequente. Estas \n\nunidades correspondem ao preenchimento da depress\u00e3o em ambiente subtidal a intertidal inferior, com \n\ncrescente influ\u00eancia marinha para o topo. As unidades D e F, com cerca de 1m de espessura, s\u00e3o \n\nconstitu\u00eddas por vasas mais ou menos arenosas. \n\nIntercalada entre as unidades D e F, e aproximadamente a 0.40m de profundidade, ocorre uma \n\nl\u00e2mina lateralmente cont\u00ednua, formada essencialmente por areia m\u00e9dia com abundantes bioclastos e \n\nintraclastos de lodo, com espessura vari\u00e1vel entre 0.8m e alguns mil\u00edmetros, diminuindo para terra. Na sua \n\nregi\u00e3o distal o calibre da areia diminui e observou-se granulotriagem positiva nos testemunhos com maior \n\nespessura. O contacto basal \u00e9 erosivo e a transi\u00e7\u00e3o a tecto bem marcada. O dep\u00f3sito apresenta-se em \n\nforma de gota alongada e estende-se para terra at\u00e9 um m\u00e1ximo de aproximadamente 800m. O perfil vertical \n\ndo excesso de 210Pb e 137Cs indica uma taxa de sedimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de 2.6mm/ano nos 0.30m superficiais. A \n\nextrapola\u00e7\u00e3o deste valor localiza a base dos lodos a tecto da unidade E na primeira metade do s\u00e9culo XIX e \n\nas idades radiocarbono do sedimento subjacente \u00e0 unidade E sugerem abla\u00e7\u00e3o de espessura consider\u00e1vel \n\nde lodos aquando da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o das areias. Estes resultados s\u00e3o consistentes com um evento raro de \n\ninunda\u00e7\u00e3o marinha extrema e muito intensa de um espa\u00e7o lagunar muito assoreado, com injec\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nsedimento ex\u00f3tico a grande dist\u00e2ncia da linha de costa, excedendo a capacidade de transporte das \n\ncorrentes de mar\u00e9 e do galgamento por tempestade. Trata-se do \u00fanico registo deste tipo de evento \n\ndetectado nesta coluna sedimentar nos \u00faltimos s\u00e9culos e compat\u00edvel com o tsunami gerado pelo sismo de 1 \n\nde Novembro de 1755, do qual existem testemunhos documentais nesta regi\u00e3o. Para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nprov\u00e1veis fontes sedimentares foram recolhidas ainda cerca de 30 amostras sedimentares de an\u00e1logos \n\nactuais (i.e. praia, duna e fundos submarinos), foram ainda detectadas evid\u00eancias de um poss\u00edvel dep\u00f3sito \n\narenoso de tempestade intercalado na unidade lodosa de topo e constrangido espacialmente \u00e0 zona \n\nadjacente \u00e0 barra. \n\nOutra \u00e1rea de estudo foi a plan\u00edcie aluvionar de Boca do Rio (tamb\u00e9m situada no Barlavento \n\nalgarvio, pr\u00f3ximo da Praia da Salema). Nesta localiza\u00e7\u00e3o uma unidade litoestratigr\u00e1fica associada ao \n\ntsunami de AD 1755 foi reconhecida anteriormente por diversos autores. A \u00e1rea aluvionar \u00e9 constitu\u00edda por \n\numa plan\u00edcie de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o supratidal que \u00e9 periodicamente sujeita a inunda\u00e7\u00f5es fluviais. Esta encontra-se \n\nseparada do mar por uma barreira de cascalho e areia e por um espor\u00e3o rochoso que, juntos, impedem o \n\ngalgamento durante as tempestades mais frequentes. Amostras de sedimentos depositados pelo tsunami e \n\nde an\u00e1logos actuais foram recolhidas nesta \u00e1rea e analisadas neste trabalho. Tr\u00eas amostras de tsunami \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nIII \n \n\n(correspondente a um perfil normal \u00e0 linha de costa) foram detalhadamente estudadas. Adicionalmente, 11 \n\namostras de sedimentos (cinco de fundos submarinos, tr\u00eas de duna, uma praia e duas recolhidas na \n\nplan\u00edcie aluvial) tamb\u00e9m foram recuperadas e utilizadas neste trabalho para caracterizar ambientes \n\nsedimentares actuais (poss\u00edveis fontes sedimentares do tsunami). \n\nNas ilhas Shetland (Esc\u00f3cia) uma l\u00e2mina arenosa intercalada em turfas tem sido comummente \n\nassociada ao tsunami provocado pelo deslizamento submarino de Storegga que ter\u00e1 ocorrido \u00e0 ca. 8000 \n\nBP. Esta unidade litoestratigr\u00e1fica composta por areia m\u00e9dia a grosseira caracteriza-se pelo contacto \n\nerosivo basal, incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de clastos de camadas subjacentes e pela sua granulotriagem positiva. Quatro \n\namostras, recolhidas nesta unidade, a partir das paredes de duas trincheiras escavadas na enseada de Voe \n\nof Scatsta (Sullom Voe), separadas por menos de 50 m, e alinhadas transversalmente, foram estudadas em \n\npormenor. Cada par de amostras estudadas cont\u00e9m uma amostra correspondente \u00e0 base do dep\u00f3sito de \n\nareia e uma segunda amostra, localizada perto do contacto superior da unidade tsunamig\u00e9nica. \n\nPor sua vez, Stoneybridge localiza-se na costa oeste da ilha de South Uist (arquip\u00e9lago das \n\nHebrides, Esc\u00f3cia). Sedimentos depositados por ondas de tempestade foram recuperados imediatamente \n\nap\u00f3s a denominada Grande Tempestade de 11 de janeiro de 2005. Este evento provocou extensa eros\u00e3o \n\nnalgumas localiza\u00e7\u00f5es costeiras e noutras (e.g. Stoneybridge) depositou uma contrastante e espessa \n\ncamada arenosa (areia m\u00e9dia a fina) a consider\u00e1veis dist\u00e2ncias da costa. Quatro amostras sedimentares \n\ndeste tempestito foram analisadas neste trabalho. \n\nLhok Nga Bay (Samatra, Indon\u00e9sia) \u00e9 uma praia cont\u00ednua em ba\u00eda, quebrada por pequenas fozes \n\nde ribeiros sazonais, que foi fortemente afectada pelo tsunami de 26 de Dezembro de 2004. As amostras \n\nutilizadas neste trabalho foram recolhidas algumas semanas ap\u00f3s esse evento. Estas correspondem a um \n\nperfil normal \u00e0 linha de costa sendo importante notar que nalgumas localiza\u00e7\u00f5es mais do que uma amostra \n\ndo sedimento tsunamig\u00e9nico foi recolhida por forma a avaliar as varia\u00e7\u00f5es verticais do dep\u00f3sito. Os \n\ndep\u00f3sitos associados ao tsunami de 2004 consistem em areias m\u00e9dia a grosseira, acinzentada a \n\namarelada, que exibem varia\u00e7\u00f5es laterais e verticais de espessura e dimens\u00e3o. O contacto inferior da \n\nunidade tsunamig\u00e9nico \u00e9 erosivo. A espessura dos dep\u00f3sitos de tsunami diminui para terra. \n\nO facto de o registo sedimentar de uma s\u00e9rie significativa de eventos de inunda\u00e7\u00f5es marinhas \n\nextremas, com morfologias e cronologias diversas, ter sido analisado permitiu a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o e a generaliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de t\u00e9cnicas sedimentol\u00f3gicas, tais como a an\u00e1lise microtextural em gr\u00e3o de quartzo e a \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o mineral\u00f3gica de amostras de tsunami e tempestade, bem como, das suas prov\u00e1veis fontes \n\nsedimentares. \n\nOs dep\u00f3sitos de tempestade e tsunami estudados constituem uma peculiaridade litoestratigr\u00e1fica, \n\num car\u00e1cter arenoso, apresentando tamb\u00e9m um contacto basal abrupto ou erosivo, diminuindo de \n\ndimens\u00e3o verticalmente e diminuindo de espessura horizontalmente. Os dep\u00f3sitos de tsunami exibem uma \n\nnot\u00e1vel varia\u00e7\u00e3o lateral em todas as caracter\u00edsticas sedimentares e geom\u00e9tricas, mesmo em dist\u00e2ncias \n\ncurtas, e todos apresentam uma estrutura interna massiva, com excep\u00e7\u00e3o do caso mais recente (tsunami \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nIV \n \n\nde 26 de Dezembro de 2004 em Lhok Nga - Indon\u00e9sia). Estes dep\u00f3sitos tsunamig\u00e9nicos apresentam \n\ntamb\u00e9m uma frequente incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de clastos de camadas subjacentes que foram erodidos durante o \n\nprocesso de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o das ondas. \n\nOs resultados obtidos a partir do estudo morfosc\u00f3pico de part\u00edculas arenosas (e.g. esfericidade e \n\nforma) revelaram que nos casos das amostras dos Salgados e Boca do Rio (Portugal) e Lhok Nga \n\n(Indon\u00e9sia), que estes atributos s\u00e3o \u00fateis na discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o de ambientes sedimentares e/ou no \n\nestabelecimento de material fonte que alimenta os dep\u00f3sitos de tsunami. \n\nResultados da an\u00e1lise microtextural revelaram que esta pr\u00e1tica \u00e9 uma t\u00e9cnica sedimentol\u00f3gica \n\ncomplementar valiosa e que pode ser aplicada quer na discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o de ambientes sedimentares, bem \n\nquer na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de dep\u00f3sitos de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o marinhas extremas, especialmente se levado em \n\nconsidera\u00e7\u00e3o o contexto regional sedimentol\u00f3gico e geomorfol\u00f3gico. As superf\u00edcies dos gr\u00e3os de quartzo \n\ndas amostras de tsunami e tempestade analisadas revelaram uma presen\u00e7a mais destacada de marcas de \n\npercuss\u00e3o e superf\u00edcies recentes. Este resultado inovador foi detectado em todas as localiza\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ngeogr\u00e1ficas estudadas.  \n\nDeterminou-se que, genericamente, a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de minerais pesados na fra\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimento \n\ntotal diminui para topo nas camadas tsunamig\u00e9nicas e nos tempestitos analisados. Num dos locais \n\nestudados (Salgados), foi poss\u00edvel estabelecer que o conte\u00fado de minerais pesados apresenta \n\nsemelhan\u00e7as qualitativas e quantitativas com as amostras de dunas. Em Lhok Nga (Indon\u00e9sia) e Boca do \n\nRio (Portugal), tamb\u00e9m foi poss\u00edvel identificar uma assinatura mineral\u00f3gica espec\u00edfica da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nassociada ao processo de retorno das ondas de tsunami. \n\nO reconhecimento da assinatura sedimentar do mesmo evento tsunamig\u00e9nico (AD 1755) e a sua \n\ncontextualiza\u00e7\u00e3o estratigr\u00e1fica forneceu motivos para sugerir uma escala milenar como per\u00edodo de retorno \n\npara eventos. No entanto, as limita\u00e7\u00f5es na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o e diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o no registo sedimentar de \n\nevid\u00eancias geol\u00f3gicas de inunda\u00e7\u00f5es marinhas extremas (e.g. a preserva\u00e7\u00e3o do dep\u00f3sito, a inexist\u00eancia de \n\ncontrastes litol\u00f3gicos e texturais, etc.) precisam ser superadas para que seja poss\u00edvel estabelecer per\u00edodos \n\nde retorno com maior assertividade. \n\nA diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o entre dep\u00f3sitos de tsunami e de tempestade foi essencialmente evidenciada pela \n\nincorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de clastos de camadas subjacentes em dep\u00f3sitos tsunamig\u00e9nicos enquanto se observou a \n\nsua aus\u00eancia nos dep\u00f3sitos de tempestade analisados. \n\nResultados globais deste trabalho sugerem que caracter\u00edsticas locais geomorfol\u00f3gicas e \n\nsedimentares podem limitar extrapola\u00e7\u00f5es acr\u00edticas sobre os mecanismos de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o (tsunami vs \n\ntempestade) de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o generalizada a todo o mundo. Em alguns casos analisados (Salgados e Boca do \n\nRio) foi poss\u00edvel evidenciar quais os prov\u00e1veis materiais fonte de cada um desses dep\u00f3sitos \n\ntsunamig\u00e9nicos. Este trabalho demonstra ainda a utilidade de t\u00e9cnicas sedimentol\u00f3gicas tais como textura, \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nV \n \n\nmorfoscopia, an\u00e1lise microtextural e composicional e contribu\u00ed para aumentar os crit\u00e9rios sedimentol\u00f3gicos \n\na ser utilizados no reconhecimento e diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o de dep\u00f3sitos de tsunami e tempestade. \n\n \n\nOs objetivos iniciais estabelecidos para este trabalho foram alcan\u00e7ados: \n\na) Unidades litoestratigr\u00e1ficas depositadas por inunda\u00e7\u00f5es marinhas extremas, durante o \n\nHoloc\u00e9nico, foram identificadas, descritas, caracterizadas e datadas; \n\nb) As amostras foram analisadas usando uma abordagem multidisciplinar, que incluiu a \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o e interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es litoestratigr\u00e1ficas, geom\u00e9tricas, dimensionais, texturais, de caracter\u00edsticas \n\nmicrotextural e composicionais, tendo sido abordadas as contrastantes escalas espaciais (que v\u00e3o desde a \n\nescala do afloramento ou coluna sedimentar \u00e0 microscopia de part\u00edculas individuais) para alcan\u00e7ar uma \n\ninterpreta\u00e7\u00e3o dos processos que controlam o transporte e deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos terr\u00edgenos de alta \n\nenergia durante eventos extremos de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o marinha; \n\nc) A an\u00e1lise microtextural foi aplicada em gr\u00e3os de quartzo a fim de determinar o material fonte \n\ne/ou para identificar assinaturas espec\u00edficas de inunda\u00e7\u00f5es marinhas extremas.

This work presents results from a variety of locations (Portugal, \n\nIndonesia and Scotland) and considers events of different chronologies and sources (AD 1755, 26 \n\nDecember 2004 and Storegga Slide tsunamis; Great Storm of 11 January 2005) that affected contrasting \n\ncoastal settings with different regional oceanographic conditions. Typically these statigraphically peculiar \n\n(essentially sand-sized) deposits exhibited an abrupt basal contact, thinning and finning inland, massive \n\nstructure and relevant lateral variation. Differentiation between tsunami and storm deposits was evidenced \n\nby the incorporation of rip-up clasts solely in the tsunamigenic deposits. Grain surface microtextural analysis \n\nproved to be a valuable complementary technique to be applied in the identification of extreme marine \n\ninundation deposits, especially when considered within a regional context. Tsunami and storm grains \n\npresented a more frequent presence of percussion marks and fresh surfaces when compared with potential \n\nsource material. Generally the concentration of heavy minerals decreased up unit and in Salgados \n\n(Portugal) the assemblage presented similarities with dune samples. In Lhok Nga (Indonesia) and Boca do \n\nRio (Portugal) it was possible to identify a mineralogical signature of the tsunami backwash.  \n\nThe assumption of a tsunami millennial return period for the Algarve (Portugal) coast was possible \n\nthrough the study of the lithostratigraphy of two locations affected by the AD1755. Overall results revealed \n\nthat site-specific effects precluded clear-cut extrapolations on a storm vs tsunami emplacement mechanism \n\nof worldwide application although it demonstrated that the use of textural, morphoscopic, microtextural and \n\nheavy mineral data will enhance the criteria to recognize and differentiate these deposits if the regional \n\ncontext is sufficiently constrained. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: sedimentology, tsunami, storm, heavy minerals, quartz microtextures \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nVIII \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nIX \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDedicated to: \n\nXII \n\nIX \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nX \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nXI \n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis thesis is the culmination of a long journey that began in early 2008. Many adventures, \n\nmisadventures, joys and sorrows were experienced during the execution of this work. The motivation to \n\ncomplete this doctoral thesis was fuelled by the valuable assistance of many people. In the following \n\nstatement I present my deep gratitude to all those people. \n\nI would like to express my enormous gratitude to my supervisor and friend Professor C\u00e9sar \n\nAndrade for his dedication, commitment and ingenuity in various stages of the Ph.D. His support, reviews, \n\nethic, rigor and enthusiasm with which he addresses any issue of Coastal Geology, was and will be an \n\nexample to follow. It was a privilege to be his student, and if today I feel a better geologist I have to be \n\nthankful, in a very great part, to Professor C\u00e9sar. \n\nMy heartfelt thanks to my co-supervisor and friend Professor Alastair Dawson with whom I learned \n\nimmensely about tsunami deposits and storminess. The numerous visits to Scotland were unique \n\nopportunities to enrich me as a geologist and as a person. His commitment to the successful completion of \n\nthis thesis was crucial. The way Alastair explains complex concepts with a disarming simplicity will, forever, \n\nbe an example to follow. \n\nProfessor Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Freitas, although not officially my co-supervisor, was instrumental in the \n\nsuccess of this work by how earnestly she helped in the completion of this thesis. Her unique work capacity, \n\nmanagement skills, her attention to detail and her scientific accuracy are of such quality that I will seek to \n\nfollow them in the coming years. \n\nTo Prof. William Mahaney my sincere and deep thanks for his support throughout this thesis. The \n\nshort-visit to Toronto (Canada) was, without a doubt, one of the defining moments of this Ph.D. The \n\ncontribution of Bill Mahaney did not stopped in the microtextural analysis, our frequent conversations and the \n\nprivilege of working with him provided me the knowledge on a range of other geological subjects. \n\nI am sincerely thankful to Dr Jo\u00e3o Cascalho (MNHN) for his invaluable help in the observation of heavy \n\nminerals and for the important discussions on various geological subjects. My thanks to Dr Raphael Paris  \n\n(Universit\u00e9 Clermont, France) who contributed to this work as a supervisor of a short-visit to Clermont-\n\nFerrand, also with numerous conversations about tsunami deposits and with the very kind offer of sediment \n\nsamples collected in Lhok Nga. I would like to express my gratitude to Dr Lenka Lisa (Institute of Geology, \n\nCzech Republic) for her guidance and support during a short-visit to Prague. I express my appreciation to \n\nProf. Pedro Cunha and Prof. Jorge Dinis (University of Coimbra) for stimulating discussions on the \n\nstratigraphy and age-estimation of tsunamigenic deposits. I am thankful to Dr Sebasti\u00e3o Teixeira for the \n\ngenerous offer of nearshore samples (Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara, Portugal) and for his availability to help during this \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nXII \n \n\nwork. I express my gratitude to Prof. Rui Taborda and to Prof. Francisco Fatela (both FCUL) for valuable \n\ndiscussions regarding different themes of the thesis. \n\nI am grateful to GeoFcul, the academic staff, employees and students for the conditions they \n\noffered me to carry out and complete this doctoral dissertation. My heartfelt thanks to ProCost (FCUL) and to \n\nfellow PhD students (GeoFcul) for the thousand and one times I have felt their support and for their \n\ncontribution to the progress of this work. In particular I want to thank my very supportive office colleagues \n\nAlexandra Oliveira, Tiago Silva, Vera Lopes and to Rita Pires, Rute Ramos, Sandra Moreira, Tanya Silveira, \n\nB\u00e1rbara Proen\u00e7a, Ivana Bosnic, M\u00f3nica Ribeiro, Cristina Lira, Cristiano Ribeiro, Marco Alves, Paula \n\nFigueiredo and Jo\u00e3o Moedas. \n\nMy acknowledgments to projects GETS (FCT-PTDC/CTE-GEX/65948/2006) and NEAREST (EU-\n\n037110-GOCE-2006) for providing the financial conditions for the realization of part of this work. My \n\ngratitude to FCT for awarding me a doctoral grant (SFRH/BD/35900/2007) that enabled this research to be \n\ncarried out. \n\nMy deep thanks to my colleagues from my 1st degree in Geology (Coimbra) and to my Briosos \n\nfriends for their unquestionable and constant support. The yearly dinners during the Queima and the Briosos \n\nDomingos were always a cause of rapprochement to Coimbra and to Geology.  \n\nMy sincere gratitude to Lu\u00eds Ramos, Filipe Saavedra, Angelina, Jo\u00e3o Brito, Jo\u00e3o Caldas, Bruno \n\nSoares, Nelo Guedes, Ana Morais, Hugo Brito, Ana F., Zira, Ricardo Branco, Adelino and other friends that \n\nalways gave me moments where true and unquestionable friendship served as an important support and \n\nmotivation to pursue and conclude this thesis. \n\nA special word to my grandfather Jos\u00e9 Miranda, my grandmother Alice, to Rui H., Paula and Carla \n\nmy profound thanks for their support and for motivating me at different stages in the long path that brought \n\nme from secondary school to the present academic achievement. \n\nA special and heartfelt thanks to my uncle Joaquim, F\u00e1tima, Jo\u00e3o, Oct\u00e1vio and Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio, and to \n\nmy brother Jorge, my sister-in-law Ana and my nephew Jos\u00e9 because always, and in all moments, they \n\nsupported and encouraged me in a unique way. \n\nWith the completion of this thesis I give my parents a brief proud moment. Those moments are the \n\nhumblest way a son can thank their parents, especially in my case because they always trusted on me and \n\nnever asked for anything in return. The many good examples that they gave me, will last with me. \n\nMy deepest thanks to the centre of my life: my son and Ana. Rui, my son, has changed and \n\nenriched my life in an inimitable way, and was also a strong motivation to complete the thesis.  \n\nI am deeply grateful to Ana who accompanied me throughout this adventure and with whom I \n\nshared all the frustrations, joys, disappointments, achievements and who always gave me a peaceful and \n\npermanent support, help, understanding, friendship, companionship and love. \n\nFor all, Obrigado!  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\nXIII \n \n\nContents \n\n \n\nResumo.....................................................................................................................................................................

Introduction \n\n1.1. Relevance of study \n\nThe study and understanding of coastal hazards is a fundamental aspect for most modern \n\nsocieties. The consequences of extreme events such as tsunamis and storms are being regarded as major \n\nthreats for coastal regions. Furthermore, the rising costs of natural hazards (in human lives and \n\neconomically) as a direct effect of the increasing occupation of the coast has raised the public awareness on \n\nthe importance of the study of these events. Although many studies have been conducted in this subject \n\nthere is still a wide range of aspects that need further investigation in order to fundament effective mitigation \n\nor adaptation procedures. Because of the non-deterministic nature of processes underlying coastal \n\ninundation the quantitative approach to their occurrence is in essence empirical and requires long series of \n\nobservations to fundament estimations of vulnerability and risk. Some scientists have extended the empirical \n\ndatabase beyond the historical record through the use of palaeoevent sedimentary deposits and have \n\nderived frequency and intensity estimates from the stratigraphic record. Because palaeoevent analyses are \n\nused to predict event recurrence and to conduct vulnerability and risk assessments, it is essential to be able \n\nto distinguish between tsunami and storm deposits in the sedimentary record. In that sense, the \n\nenhancement of the recognition and differentiation of tsunami and storm sedimentological signatures \n\nthrough the application of diverse techniques is a pertinent and innovative contribution of this work, which \n\napplies microtextural analysis and heavy mineral characterization to discuss marine inundation deposits and \n\ntheir possible source materials together with other attributes more widely used. Furthermore, this thesis \n\npresents results from a variety of geographical locations (Portugal, Indonesia and Scotland), of different \n\nchronologies (AD 1755, 26th December 2004, the 2nd Storegga Slide tsunamis and the Great Storm of 11th \n\nJanuary 2005) and different coastline configurations and contrasting oceanographic conditions (Figure 1.1). \n\nThe use of such a multiplicity of contexts provides a unique sustenance for conclusions to be drawn \n\nregarding the characterization and differentiation of extreme marine inundations sedimentary signatures. \n\n \n\n1.2. Aims and objectives \n\nThis work offers a novel opportunity to address a relevant aspect for many coastal areas worldwide: \n\nto extend the time dimension of the database analysed for the establishment of extreme marine inundation \n\nrisks. With that purpose a location in the Algarve coast of Portugal (Salgados), where a new tsunamigenic \n\ndeposit associated with the AD 1755 was observed and characterized, is presented. This location offers a \n\nnumber of features providing further evidences of the path followed by the tsunami overwash and hopefully \n\nwill contribute to the clarification of the on-going debate about the AD 1755 epicentre and tsunami \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\ngeneration area. Furthermore, the re-analyses of several locations (Boca do Rio, Sullom Voe and Lhok \n\nNga), where tsunami deposits have been previously detected, allows an adequate background to test the \n\napplication of different sedimentological proxies in areas that suffered from the  impact of extreme marine \n\ninundations of which independent descriptions exist and where the sediment record conserved evidences of \n\nthose events. \n\nA specific storm deposit (Stoneybridge, Scottish Outer Hebrides) was also analysed and compared \n\nwith tsunamigenic signatures from the above mentioned locations. The fact that a significant range of \n\nlocations, age and events were analysed permits the successful application and generalization of techniques \n\nsuch as grain microtextural imprints and mineralogical signature observed in samples from all locations. \n\nAlthough local details can be relevant factors, an important achievement of this work is to test and increase \n\nthe number of proxies that can be used in the sedimentological analysis of tsunami and storm deposits. \n\nIn agreement with the line of thought mentioned above, a number of work purposes were identified \n\nand subsequent field and office work and laboratory analyses were conducted in order to achieve the \n\nfollowing objectives: \n\na) To recognize coastal sediments deposited by Holocene extreme marine inundations; \n\nb) To analyse sediment samples using a multidisciplinary approach; \n\nc) To apply microtextural analysis in order to establish the source material or/and to identify specific \n\nsignatures of extreme marine inundations in coastal sediments; \n\nd) To apply heavy minerals to establish source material or/and to identify specific signatures of \n\nextreme marine inundations in those materials; \n\ne) To forward, whenever possible, return periods for extreme marine inundations; \n\nf) To contribute to developing criteria able to recognize and differentiate tsunami and storm \n\ndeposits. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 - Ph.D. studied areas.

Structure of document \n\nThis document is organized in order to present the data in association with each study area mainly \n\ndue to the fact that this structure would provide the reader the opportunity to analyse each case on its own \n\nand generalize interpretations and conclusions at a later stage. The adopted structure also permits a better \n\nunderstanding of each methodological result regardless of the number of samples (that varied due to \n\nconstrains in sampling). \n\nThe thesis is divided in an introductory part (Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4), a data presentation part \n\n(Chapter 5) and a discussion and conclusion part (Chapters 6 and 7). Chapter 1 presents a brief description \n\nof the aims and structure of the thesis. This chapter stresses the relevance of this research for the wider \n\nproblem of coastal hazard and the contribution to tsunami and storm sedimentary recognition and their \n\ndifferentiation. Chapter 2 is organized in five sub-chapters. Sub-chapter 2.1 presents a concise summary of \n\nthe physical aspects associated with storms and tsunamis (i.e. generation, propagation, run-up and \n\nbackwash). The following sub-chapter (2.2) considers the geological signature of extreme marine \n\ninundations by presenting a summary of the work conducted and by describing the different types of \n\ncharacteristics associated with these extreme marine events. Sub-chapter 2.3 presents a revision of the \n\ncriteria associated with the recognition of tsunami deposits in coastal stratigraphy. Sub-chapter (2.4) debates \n\nthe controversy associated with the differentiation of tsunami and storm deposits and the respective coastal \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nhazards. A summary of previous research conducted in the study areas is the focus of sub-chapter 2.5. This \n\nsub-chapter is sub-divided in three parts, one for each regional study area (Algarve, Scotland and \n\nIndonesia). The detailed geographical, geological and oceanographic characterization of the study areas is \n\nthe focus of Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents the methodology used in this research. A description of the \n\nsampling, lithostratigraphic, textural, morphoscopic, micromorphological, microtextural, mineralogical and \n\nage-estimation techniques used in this work are presented in this chapter. Chapter 5 presents results from \n\nSalgados (Algarve, Portugal), Boca do Rio (Algarve, Portugal), Voe of Scasta (Shetland Islands, Scotland), \n\nLhok Nga (Sumatra, Indonesia) and Stoneybridge (Hebrides Islands, Scotland). This chapter is divided into \n\nfive sub-chapters (i.e. one for each specific study area). The results in each sub-chapter are presented in the \n\nfollowing order: lithostratigraphic, textural, morphoscopic, microtextural and mineralogical results. In the \n\nlithostratigraphy section the sampling strategy, the lithostratigraphic data, the spatial architecture of the \n\ndeposit and the chronology are presented. In the textural results, the data presented include an analysis of \n\ngrain-size characteritics. The morphoscopy data presents the percentage of quartz, lithic material and \n\nbioclasts within the studied samples, as well as the roundness and sphericity character of quartz grains from \n\nthe analysed samples. The microtextural results include the exoscopic analysis of quartz grains. Finally, the \n\nmineralogical results provide an analysis of the heavy mineral content for each study area. \n\nThe final part of the thesis is dedicated to the Discussion (Chapter 6) and Conclusions (Chapter 7). \n\nChapter 6 interprets and discusses the results presented in the previous chapter and it is divided into eight \n\nsub-chapters. Sub-chapter 6.1 considers the textural and lithostratigraphical features of extreme marine \n\ninundations. Sub-chapter 6.2 debates the morphoscopic signatures of the analysed tsunami and storm \n\nsamples. The following sub-chapter (6.3) discusses the microtextural features associated with extreme \n\nmarine events. Sub-chapter 6.4 comprises an investigation of heavy mineral assemblages as an aid in the \n\ndifferentiation of tsunami and storm deposits. Sub-chapter 6.5 briefly discusses the differentiation of \n\nsedimentary environments. Sub-chapter 6.6 compares several sedimentological characteristics of deposits \n\nlay down by a single event. Sub-chapter 6.7 widens the discussion by addressing the sedimentological \n\ncharacterization of multi-tsunamigenic events. The succeeding sub-chapter (6.8) presents an analysis of the \n\nsedimentary characteristics of tsunami and storm deposits while comparing different events. \n\nThe conclusions in chapter 7 summarize the major achievements and inferences resulting from this \n\nwork and these are completed by the proposal of future research lines and work to be conducted in this field \n\nof Science. In addition to the main document, this Ph.D. thesis includes supplementary information \n\norganized in 2 Annexes. Annex 1 consists of the geological legend of the Geological map of the Algarve. \n\nAnnex 2 presents an Atlas of microtextural features observed in quartz grains; this annex provides a \n\ncomprehensive view of the full variety of microtextures found, studied and interpereted by the author and is a \n\ncontribution to the few existing publications on microtexture characterization and interpretation of quartz \n\ngrains.  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n2. State of the art \n\n2.1. Extreme marine inundations: origin and mechanisms \n\nExtreme marine inundations triggered by tsunami and storms have an undoubtedly important \n\nsignificance for studies on coastal evolution and coastal management. The investigation of these events is a \n\nmajor concern for many scientists, trying to understand the underlying processes and contributing to mitigate \n\nimpacts of the inundations. The understanding of the associated physics is of unquestionable interest for \n\nobvious reasons, but also from a (less immediate) geological perspective: allowing a better comprehension \n\nof the consequences of such events, namely of those that will certainly occur in the future with magnitude \n\nexceeding the largest observed or documented event in history. \n\nStorms are produced by meteorological disturbances and generate high energy waves and surf, \n\nwhereas the most frequent causes of tsunamis are related with offshore rupture and significant vertical \n\ndisplacement of the seafloor, thus implying large magnitude ruptures. These are induced either by tectonic \n\nstress and associated to earthquakes, or by both sub-areal and submarine large-scale landslides. \n\nFurthermore, meteorite impacts and the collapse of volcanic buildings and other large-scale volcanic \n\nprocesses may also generate tsunamis. \n\nStorms are one of the most alarming natural hazards due to their frequency at annual time scales \n\nand concentration of resources and population in coastal areas. The erosional capacity of storms is one of \n\nits main features; however, in some circumstances, storms can also leave a sedimentological signature in \n\nthe stratigraphy of a given coastal area normally resting above sea level, if overwash allows for extensive \n\ninundation of the landward section of the coastal area by sediment-loaded marine water. Storms are \n\nproduced by effects of wind and atmospheric-pressure differences in the surface of the ocean. Storms can \n\nbe classified in agreement with the Beaufort wind scale (Table 2.1). \n\nExtreme storms such as hurricanes (also called Typhoons in the Indian Ocean) are produced when \n\nhigh-speed winds tend to spiral inland towards a core of very low pressure. When any storm occurs the rise \n\nin wave heights (and thus in the energy they carry and dissipate at the coast when breaking) is noticeable. In \n\naddition to wave energy, low pressure may increase the sea level well above the astronomical tide level, \n\nraising the ocean surface by considerable amounts and facilitating the inundation of the coastal land. \n\nStorms are major agents of coastal forcing given their potential to transport sediments alongshore \n\nand cross-shore. According to Andrade et al. (2004) clastic shores in mesoscale equilibrium with the wave \n\nregime, as well as starved coasts, are particularly sensitive to storms because the instantaneous \n\ndisturbances generated by storms may exceed the resilience of the coastal system, which is unable to \n\nresume the previous equilibrium conditions in the absence of a relevant external source of sediment. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nTable 2.1 - Beaufort wind scale (US Army Corps of Engineering, 2003). \n\nBeaufort number \nWind speed \n\n(knots) \n\nWorld Meteorological \n\nOrganization description \n\n0&lt;1 Calm \n\n1 1-3 Light air \n\n2 4-6 Light Breeze \n\n3 7-10 Gentle Breeze \n\n4 11-16 Moderate Breeze \n\n5 17-21 Fresh Breeze \n\n6 22-27 Strong Breeze \n\n7 28-33 Near Gale \n\n8 34-40 Gale \n\n9 41-47 Storm Gale \n\n10 48-55 Storm \n\n11 56-63 Violent Storm \n\n12 >64 Hurricane \n\n \n\nIt is necessary to examine the past decadal- to millennial-scale variability of storm activity in order \n\nto determine the frequency of the most extreme events in relation to the climate evolution. Regional studies \n\non the long-term variability of storm frequency, magnitude and tracks and of storm-related hazards (e.g. \n\nOrford et al., 1996; Langenberg et al., 1999; Kaas et al., 2000) suggest that they have been changing \n\nthroughout the last 150 years, although there is no evidence of a trend in this time interval The extension of \n\nthe observation period further back in time, therefore including the geological record, allows the \n\nreconstruction of  storminess patterns that may be used to re-evaluate the return period of most extreme \n\nevents, which are generally extrapolated from short-term instrumental series of observations (Andrade et al., \n\n2004). Furthermore, it has been established that negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index winters are \n\nassociated with a southward shift in the Atlantic storm activity and a noticeable increase in storm activity in \n\nIberia (Hurrell, 2003). They are also reflected in Portugal by increased precipitation and fluvial floods (Trigo \n\net al., 2004), as well as higher sea-level caused by barometric lows and reinforced westerly winds (Guerra et \n\nal., 2000). An inverse correlation between NAO values and the solar activity was also established (Kirov and \n\nGeorgieva, 2002) and consequently low solar irradiance corresponds to lower storminess. One can state \n\nthat research on causes and variations in storm intensity, and especially in investigation of storminess \n\ntrends, is a key issue in projecting the impact of storminess in the future evolution of coasts. In this context, \n\nfinding sedimentological records of past catastrophic storm events are essential to evaluate the long term \n\nclimatic evolution in a given coastal area allowing to separate variations corresponding to trends from long \n\nterm oscillations. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nIn terms of risk to coastal assets and probability of generating a conspicuous record in the coastal \n\nsedimentary archive surges generated by storms is their most relevant facet. Storm surges are changes in \n\nsea level caused by extreme weather events. In both tropical and extra-tropical regions they are generated \n\nby intense cyclones and especially hurricanes, the latter being characteristic of the former regions. The \n\nimpact of the surge is dependent of the size, duration, strength, velocity and track of the meteorological \n\ndisturbance but it also depends of the morphology and extension of the shelf margining of the target coast. \n\nStorm surges are common in many coastlines all over the world and literature on storm impacts is \n\nto a large extent biased to the settings where they play the major role in coastal forcing and responsibility for \n\ndamages. However, this is not the case of mainland Portugal, where the dimensions and morphology of the \n\nshelf, location within the extratropical zone and exposurue to high wave energy, indicate that direct wave \n\naction exceeds in relevance the effects of storm surge (e.g. SIAM I and II project - Santos et al., 2002 and \n\nSantos and Miranda, 2006). In this respect, storm waves, even exceptional in energy, differ from tsunamis \n\nbecause they break and release most of the associated energy within the seaward section of the coastal \n\nzone. An increase in height of a wind wave will inevitably induce breaking at increased depth, thus extending \n\nthe dimension of the surf zone. This is in clear contrast with tsunami waves which, regardless their height, \n\nare always very large in length, exceeding by far the longest wind-gerated wave. This makes a substantial \n\ndifference in the type and amount of work and impact that a wind or a tsunami generated wave can produce \n\nwhen impinging on a coastal area. \n\nThe word tsunami is a phonetic transcription from the Japanese word meaning \u201charbour wave\u201d, not \n\nin the sense used in hydraulics and coastal enegineering (seiche) but reflecting the belief that they formed \n\nvery close to the harbours or fishing settlements. According to Lapidus (1990), \u201cTsunami is the gravity-wave \n\nsystem that follows any short-duration, large-scale disturbance of the free sea surface.\u201d A tsunami generally \n\nconsists of a small number of long-period solitary waves that can be generated by any disturbance that \n\ndisplaces a large water mass from its equilibrium position. Tsunami waves are usually small in height and \n\nbarely noticed in the deep ocean, but they grow in height (sometimes to dramatic dimensions) and increase \n\nthe potential to cause damage when travelling in shallow water, namely just before impacting the coast \n\n(Sugawara et al., 2008). Tsunami waves can travel virtually unnoticed through the open ocean because of \n\nextreme low values of steepness (essentially modulated by very large wavelength), an attribute that normally \n\nprevents breaking throughout the whole travel distance. Thus destruction caused by tsunamis is the direct \n\nresult of abrupt inundation of extensive costal ribbons, accompanied by impact on structures and erosion. \n\nBesides hitting coastal targets unbroken, one other important difference to wind waves is that the time \n\nintervals spent by the inundation and seaward back flow associated to each tsunami wave exceeds by at \n\nleast two orders of magnitude the ones of a wind wave. \n\nThe life span of a tsunami may be divided into three stages: the generation (discussed above), the \n\nstage of propagation to the coast and finally the inundation of the coastal fringe with intensity that may be \n\nquantified in terms of run-up and run-in. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nThe equation describing tsunami wave celerity while propagating anywhere in the sea is given by linear \n\ntheory as the \u201cshallow water equation\u201d:  \n\n  ?    Equation 2.1 \n\nwhere c is wave celerity (ms-1); g is gravitic acceleration (ms-2) and h is local depth (m). \n\nThe non-linear character of this relation, showing that celerity (and thus wavelength) solely depends \n\non depth and nearly complete conservation of total energy by water waves during propagation, explains the \n\ndramatic consequences of shoaling effects on tsunami waves when propagating in very shallow coastal \n\nwaters. Conservation of total energy can only be achieved if the very significant reduction in the kinetic \n\ncomponent accompanying propagation in progressively shallower water is compensated by an increase in \n\npotential energy, measurable by the difference in elevation between crest and trough \u2013 the wave height. \n\nIf the triggering mechanism of a tsunami corresponds to a point-source (e.g. vocanic explosion, \n\nslope mass movement) the waves will radiate from the source with a strong angular dispersion and affect a \n\nprogressively wider fan-shaped domain. The length of the leading wave crest will increase exponentially with \n\ntime and thus the associated energy density will necessarily decrease. This explains the strong attenuation \n\ncharacterizing most events triggered by avalanches, slides or volcanic activity, their impacts being felt \n\nessentially in targets located at short distances from the source. The exceptions are associated with \n\ninfrequent mechanisms capable of displacing extremely large volumes along the sea floor (such as the 2nd \n\nStoregga slide) and affecting the shores of a wide oceanic basin. In contrast, an extensive rupture of the sea \n\nfloor, such as promoted by a major thrust fault system, can better be described as a linear source, thus \n\ndisturbing the simple circular-shaped radiation model. In this case, most of the wave energy is focused in the \n\ndirection perpendicular to the strike of the main source and only the energy propagating parallel to the \n\nregional tectonic trend leaks laterally and is strongly diminished in density. If the rupture area is located \n\nclose to or within a continental margin, within several minutes after generation the initial disturbance is split \n\ninto a wave set that travels out to the deep ocean (a distant or tele-tsunami regarding the impacted areas on \n\nthe opposite margin) and another that travels towards the nearby coast (local tsunami). Several events \n\nhappen as the local tsunami travels over the continental slope and shelf. The most obvious one is that the \n\nwave amplitude increases. The tsunami energy flux, which is dependent on both the wave speed and wave \n\nheight, remains nearly constant. Consequently, as the tsunami speed diminishes as it travels into shallower \n\nwater, its height grows. Because of this shoaling effect, a tsunami, imperceptible at deep sea, may grow to \n\nbe several meters in height near the coast. Moreover, the propagation path is sensitive to the ocean bottom \n\nmorphology, an effect shared also by wind waves and described by the laws of wave refraction. Bottom \n\nmorphology, analogously to an optical lens, may focus or defocus (sic, Tinti, 1990) the water wave rays, \n\nthereby increasing or decreasing the wave amplitude by modulating their energy and power density. The \n\neffects of refraction are more evident in the case of tsunamis given their larger wave length and explain why \n\nin most cases the wave angles at the shore are reduced. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nAs the tsunami wave travels from the deep-water through the continental slope and shelf to the \n\nnearshore and finally the coastal region, the height attained by the wave crest may exceed the shore \n\nelevation, thus allowing for inundation of terrestrial land (Figure 2.1). The excess water brought in by the \n\nincoming wave crest (which extends hundreds of meters into the ocean) is pushed further inland at very high \n\nspeeds until the counter effects of attrition and gravity stop inundation from progressing further inland. The \n\nintensity of the inundation is usually described in terms of run-up and run-in. Run-up is usually defined as the \n\nmaximum height attained by the flood water onshore, measured  above a reference sea level, though some \n\nauthors have used the term to describe the maximum height (on land) reached by a tsunami as it encounters \n\nthe coast. Both definitions yield different values characterizing the same event and the former is adopted in \n\nthis study. Run-in or depth of inundation is the maximum horizontal distance landward of the coastline that \n\nthe tsunami inundation was able to reach. Run-up is primarily controlled by the length and amplitude of the \n\ntsunami waves, coastal shape and by the bathymetric profile of the sub-littoral shelf and slope regions \n\nacross which the tsunami is approaching the coast (Bourgeois et al. 1999; Tappin et al. 2001; Weiss et al. \n\n2006). In addition, roughness and slopes of the dryland met by the inrushing flood also control both the run-\n\nup and run-in. Consequently, run-up heights, distances and flow depths of inundation can vary significantly \n\nalong a given shoreline. \n\nAfter the inundation, part of the tsunami energy is returned back to the ocean as a huge, long-\n\nlasting and typically channelled backwash. In addition, a tsunami can excite a particular type of standing \n\nwaves (edge waves) that oscillate parallel to shore and are entrapped in the coastal zone. The interference \n\nbetween incoming and edge waves may further complicate the longshore distribution pattern of wave height \n\nat the shore with implications in run-up and run-in. Because of this complicated behaviour near the coast \n\nand of the changes in attrition of the coastal surface following the first inundation, the first run-up and run-in \n\nof a tsunami are often not the largest. The arrival of a tsunami surge is sometimes preceded by extensive \n\nretreat of the sea, exposing the sea-bottom, and there are several terms that are used to describe this \n\nphenomenon. The one to use depends on circumstances (e.g., whether the tsunami is in a bay or estuary) \n\nand on personal preference. The terms \u201cnegative wave\u201d, \u201cdrawdown\u201d and \u201cwithdrawal\u201d are most often used \n\nto describe this type of initial onset. Less formal are the terms 'waterline receding' and \u201cbay emptying\u201d. The \n\nunderlying reason for this effect is that both offshore landslides and earthquakes may create a negative \n\npattern of disturbance of the sea surface (trough) on the shoreward side of the bottom deformation, in \n\nrelation with sudden and localized decrease of the water depth, if this trough propagates to the shore and \n\narrives there before the following crest, it produces the drawdown (GITEC-2, 1995). In coastal areas the \n\ndevastation produced by a high magnitude tsunami can be enormous. The destruction of infrastructures \n\ncaused by tsunamis is due to \u201cdrag and flotation forces associated with the waves (...), strong induced \n\ncurrents (...) and floating debris\u201d (Tinti, 1990). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. - Schematic illustration of principal pathways of tsunami sediment transport and deposition (Dawson and \nStewart, 2007 after Einsele et al., 1996). \n\n \n\nThe two most important aspects that characterise tsunamis are the magnitude and the intensity. \n\nThe traditional magnitude scale is the so-called Imamura-Iida (Iida, 1963). The magnitude value (m) is \n\napproximately equal to: \n\n        Equation 2.2 \n\n \n\nwhere h is the maximum run-up height in meters. \n\nHataori (1979) extended the Imamura-Iida m scale to include far-field tsunami data, and considering the \n\neffect of distance. Another magnitude scale, Mt, called tsunami magnitude, was defined and assigned for \n\nmany earthquakes by Abe (1979). The definition of Mt for a Trans-Pacific tsunami (Abe, 1979) is: \n\n               Equation 2.3 \n\n \n\nand for a regional tsunami (100km&lt;?&lt;3500km) tsunami (Abe, 1981) is: \n\n                 Equation 2.4 \n\n \n\nwhere H is the maximum amplitude recorded on tide gauges in meters, C is a distance factor depending on \n\nthe location of the source and the observation points and ? is the actual travel distance in km. The empirical \n\nformulas above where calibrated for earthquakes with moment magnitude Mw 3. \n\nThe above mentioned magnitude scales have focused in the more frequent earthquake generated \n\ntsunamis. However, although most tsunamis are triggered by earthquakes, it is unquestionably important to \n\ndevote the necessary attention to tsunamis triggered by landslides or volcanic eruptions. In fact the largest \n\never recorded tsunami wave was observed in 1958 on a tsunami caused by a major submarine landslide \n\n(Aleutya Bay, Alaska, United States). Submarine landslides frequently occur in the aftermath of an \n\nearthquake (causing tsunamis much more localized than those from the earthquake itself, but at the same \n\ntime potentially very destructive) (Bardet et al. 2003; Okal and Synolakis 2003). The fact that submarine \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nlandslide tsunamis often have large run-up heights close to the source area but appear to propagate much \n\nless efficiently than earthquake tsunamis was exemplified by the 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami, where \n\nrun-up heights up to 15 m affected a 20 km segment of the coast (Dengler and Preuss 2003; McSaveney et \n\nal. 2000), while farther afield the tsunami was not a significant event (Okal and Synolakis 2004; Satake and \n\nTanioka 2003). \n\nVolcanic triggered tsunamis present similar features. There are at least nine different mechanisms \n\nby which volcanoes produce tsunamis, including volcanic earthquakes, eruptions of undersea volcanoes, \n\nflow of pyroclastic masses into the sea, caldera collapse, debris avalanches and landslides, large lahars \n\nentering the sea, phreatomagmatic explosions, coupling between water and turbulent air waves travelling \n\nfrom an explosive eruption, and collapse of lava benches during effusive lava eruptions (Beget, 2000). In \n\nparticular, volcanic tsunamis are typically generated within a very small geographic area on the flank of a \n\nvolcano, and may even be modelled as a point source (Kienle et al., 1987). All evaluations of volcanic \n\ntsunami hazard should integrate both investigations of ancient volcanic tsunami deposits and studies of \n\nvolcanic eruption history of island volcanoes and volcanoes located near coastal areas, to connect records \n\nof volcanic activity with the much more fragmentary geologic record of past tsunamis. Paris et al. (2011a) \n\nacknowledged that tsunamis generated by volcano flank failures represent a very low frequency but very \n\nhigh magnitude hazard. These volcano-gravitational events involving tens to hundreds of km\u00b3 are evidenced \n\nby voluminous submarine debris, such as in the Hawaiian Islands (Moore et al., 1989; Normark et al., 1993; \n\nMcMurtry et al., 2004), Reunion Island (Oehler et al., 2004), Canary Islands (Krastel et al., 2001; Masson et \n\nal., 2002; Paris et al., 2005) or the Cape Verde Islands (Masson et al., 2008; Madeira et al., 2011). \n\nIndependently of the source mechanism, tsunami intensity scales can be established based on the \n\neffects in coastal areas. For tsunami intensity three different scales have been proposed. Soloviev (1970) \n\npointed out that Imamura-Iida\u2019s scale is more like an earthquake intensity scale rather than a magnitude. He \n\nalso distinguished the maximum tsunami height (h) and the mean tsunami height along a stretch of coast \n\n(hr). He then defined tsunami intensity (i) as: \n\n           Equation 2.5 \n\n \n\nThe Sieberg intensity scale \u2013 a descriptive intensity scale based on the physical destruction caused by \n\ntunami waves (Ambraseys, 1962) - ranks tsunamis from light tsunamis (Level 1) to disastrous tsunamis \n\n(Level 6) by their impacts. Furthermore, Papadopoulos and Imamura (2001) proposed a new intensity scale \n\nbased in the effect on humans and on objects (of different sizes and nature) and the damage caused to \n\nbuildings. This new scale varies from level I (Not felt) to level XII (completely devastating). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n2.2. Tsunami and storm deposits in the geological record \n\nThe Holocene stratigraphy of a specific region reflects the group and succession of \n\nsedimentological processes that affected the area during time. These processes include intra-basinal, \n\nregional or global-scale mechanisms operating at different scales. In addition to the processes operating in \n\npermanence in a region, which prevail in the facies architecture and succession of the sedimentary record, \n\ncatastrophic events such as tsunamis and storms can contribute significantly to the stratigraphy of any given \n\narea. In contrast to modern tsunami, for which eyewitness accounts and field measurements of both \n\nerosional and depositional effects are utilized in modelling studies, (palaeo)tsunami recognition depends on \n\nthe identification of ancient tsunami deposits (e.g. Bourgeois et al., 1988; Long et al., 1989; Smit et al., 1992; \n\nBondevik et al., 1997, Dawson and Stewart, 2007, Mahaney et al. 2010; Chagu\u00e9-Goff et al., 2011). More \n\nrecently, the term \u201ctsunamiite\u201d has also been used to describe onshore sedimentary deposits lay down by \n\ntsunami events (Shiki et al., 2008). Tsunami deposition is commonly characterized by the re-deposition of \n\ncoarse shallow marine or coastal sediments in terrestrial and/or transitional (e.g. lagoonal, estuarine) \n\nenvironments. Recognition of these deposits is the primary method for reconstructing tsunami minimum \n\ninundation distance and run-up, although patterns of erosion and deposition by both landward- and seaward-\n\ndirected flows are complex, these patterns being further complicated by the existence of more than one \n\nwave associated with the same tsunami (Moore and Moore, 1984; Synolakis et al., 1995; Bondevik et al., \n\n1997; Dawson and Shi, 2000; Le Roux and Vargas, 2005; Paris et al., 2007), thus introducing uncertainties \n\nin those reconstructions. In particular, because the maximum altitude at which tsunami sediments are \n\ndeposited in the coastal zone is nearly always lower than the height reached by the tsunami. In fact, the \n\nupper sediment limit is generally regarded as a minimum level reached by the tsunami waves (this \n\nassumption is of crucial importance for hazard and physical and numerical modelling because sediment \n\nevidence might underestimate the flooding penetration). \n\nThe nature of tsunami deposits varies greatly with coastal and nearshore morphology, the height of \n\ntsunami waves at the coast and run-up, and with the nature and amount of existing sediment in any coastal \n\nsetting when affected by such an event. Consequently, the possible variations in sedimentary processes and \n\nproducts during these complex events remains poorly understood but in general a tsunami deposit will only \n\nbe produced if there is a suitable supply of sediment and accommodation space in the coastal zone. More \n\nrecently, the subsequent backwash, or return flow, has been regarded as a process of significant \n\ngeomorphic and sedimentologic consequences (e.g. Dawson, 1994; Dawson, 1999; Hindson and Andrade, \n\n1999; Dawson and Shi, 2000; Le Roux and Vargas, 2005; Paris et al., 2010b), though the spatial extension \n\nof the correspondent signature is usually more restricted due to channelling effects. The geomorphological \n\nconsequences of tsunamis and storms in coastal dunes or barrier islands have also been addressed (e.g. \n\nAndrade, 1990; Andrade et al., 2004; Regnauld et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2009; Dinis et al., 2010; Goff et \n\nal., 2010b). \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nDue to their specific physics and sediment transport processes tsunami and storms tend to leave \n\ntheir sediment imprint in a wide range of environments (e.g. alluvial plains, estuaries, coastal lagoons, \n\nembayments, nearshore and offshore areas) although storms usually present a smaller amount of inland \n\npenetration. However, many of these environments display a low preservation potential for event deposits \n\n(Einsele et al., 1996) and the recognition of tsunami and storm deposits is many times constrained by the \n\npoor preservation of those deposits (or absence) in the stratigraphic record. In many cases, the \n\nanthropogenic activity, the erosion characteristics of the event, the relative changes in sea level in a \n\nmillennium timescale and the absence of lithological differentiation makes palaetsunami deposits difficult to \n\nidentify and therefore also makes it difficult to make inferences regarding the return intervals of such events \n\n(Szczucinski, 2011; Yawsangratt et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Nearshore and offshore deposits \n\nNearshore and offshore deposits have been described essentially in association with several \n\nspecific tsunami events worldwide (Smit et al., 1992; Cita et al., 1996; Fujiwara et al., 2000; van der Bergh et \n\nal., 2003; Terrinha et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2005; Noda et al., 2007; Abrantes et al., 2008; Gracia et al., \n\n2010) and were considered by Dawson and Stewart (2008) a \u201cvery much neglected research area\u201d within \n\ntsunami sedimentary recognition. Weiss and Bahlburg (2006) considered that offshore tsunami depositon in \n\ndeep marine environments well below the wave base of severe storms are theoretically much more likely to \n\npreserve tsunami deposits than shallow settings. Despite of that fact, these authors noted that there are only \n\na few descriptions in the literature of marine, and particularly subtidal, tsunami deposits (Pratt, 2001, 2002; \n\nBussert and Aberhan 2004; Cantalamessa and Di Celma 2005; Schnyder et al. 2005). \n\nIn the offshore area, the term \u201cdeep-sea homogenite\u201d has been used to define a massive, poorly \n\nsorted, grain-supported unit that contains large reworked shallow-marine fossils and occasional large \n\nintraclasts that have been described in association with the Bronze Age Santorini tsunami event (Cita et al., \n\n1996). Other tsunamigenic deposits were discussed in an offshore sedimentary context and related with \n\nevents such as the K/T meteoric tsunami (e.g. Smit et al., 1992; Albert\u00e3o and Martins, 1996), the AD 1755 \n\ntsunami (Terrinha et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2005 and 2008; Gracia et al., 2010), the 2003 Tokashioki \n\nearthquake (Noda et al., 2007) or to try and match earthquake-triggered turbidites with tsunamigenic events \n\nfrom the Saguenay (Eastern Canada) and Reloncavi (Chilean margin) (St Onge et al., 2012). In fact, another \n\npeculiar note in terms of offshore tsunami deposits is that some have been specifically attributed to \n\nprocesses of tsunami backwash and the generation of gravity-driven flows of turbid water from nearshore to \n\ndeep water (e.g. Abrantes et al., 2008; Paris et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n2.2.2. Onshore boulder deposits \n\nThere are two main types of onshore sedimentary evidences associated with tsunami and storms: \n\none consisting in deposits of large boulders and the other in the deposition of finer (typically sand-sized) \n\nsediments in coastal areas. The universally accepted scale of grain sizes of siliciclastic sediment is the \n\nUden-Wentworth (Wentworth, 1922) scale that is composed of four basic groups: clay (&lt;4\u00b5m), silt (4\u00b5m - \n\n63\u00b5m), sand (63\u00b5m - 2mm) and gravel (> 2mm). The larger particles (i.e. pebbles, cobbles and boulders) \n\nwere all included in the gravel group. To facilitate the classification of larger particles Blair and McPherson \n\n(1999) revised the Udden-Wentworth scale to describe in greater detail the size of boulders and other larger \n\nparticles. The grain size of fine, medium, coarse, and very coarse boulders range from 25.6 to 51.2cm, 51.2 \n\nto 102.4cm, 102.4 to 204.8cm, and 204.8 to 409.6cm, respectively. Larger rocks or megaclasts, include fine \n\n(4.1 to 8.2m) and medium (8.2 to 16.4m) blocks. \n\nThe identification and differentiation of tsunami and storm deposits and their association with \n\nspecific events is of crucial importance for hazard or risk studies. Boulder and finer deposits can provide \n\nclues to the identification of both types of events. In the case of larger particles, the differentiation is firstly \n\nbased on the identification of boulders that have been transported inland or upward from or within the \n\ncoastal zone, and against gravity. In some cases, these boulders appear simply overturned a few m inland \n\nfrom their original source area. The recognition of boulder deposits associated with both tsunami and storms \n\nhas been intensely debated in the literature (e.g. Bryant et al., 1992; Young et al., 1996; Nott, 1997; Bryant \n\nand Nott, 2001; Noormets et al., 2002; Goff et al., 2004; Williams and Hall., 2004, Scheffers and Kelletat, \n\n2005; Goff et al., 2006; Hall et al., 2006; Bourrouilh-Le Jan et al., 2007; Goto et al., 2007; Scheffers and \n\nScheffers, 2007; Kelletat, 2008; Paris et al., 2010b; Scheffers, 2008; Scheffers et al.,2008, Etienne and \n\nParis, 2010; Fichaut and Suanez, 2010; Goto et al., 2010a; Goto et al., 2010b; Nandasena et al., 2011a). \n\nFrom the many examples in the literature a few deserve special notice because of their specific lithological, \n\ngeological, geomorphological or oceanographic significance. \n\nIn terms of boulder deposits there are many examples worldwide attributed to deposition by storms \n\nand tsunami (compiled by e.g. Sheffers and Kelletat, 2003; Scheffers, 2008). They range from over 10 cubic \n\nmetres up to 1000m3 and, depending on the bulk rock density their mass can exceed 2000t (Scheffers and \n\nKelletat, 2003). They have been found at various elevations from the intertidal zone to a few tens of meters \n\nabove the present sea level. Shi et al. (1995) reported that hundreds of boulders were deposited as far as \n\n200m inland by the December 12, 1992 tsunami in Flores (Indonesia), especially in the area of Riangkroko \n\nwhere the run-up reached 26m. The deposition of boulders in association with tsunamigenic events were \n\ndiscussed essentially after the 1990\u2019s (e.g. Paskoff 1991; Dawson 1994; Hindson and Andrade, 1999). For \n\ninstance, Hindson and Andrade (1999) noted that at several locations on the Algarve coastline the AD 1755 \n\ntsunami was associated with the deposition of both continuous and discontinuous sand sheets, some of \n\nwhich containing boulders. The individual boulders were frequently pitted and sculptured by bioerosion and \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\nin hollows marine endolithic mollusca were found and used to indicate the marine provenance of the \n\nboulders. \n\nThe imbrication of boulders (at certain altitudes and distances from the coastal edge), coupled with \n\nthe presence of shell and debris inclusions, were used as a diagnostic criteria of tsunami deposits (Bryant \n\nand Nott, 2001). Hall et al. (2006) focused exclusively in storm wave impacts on boulders sitting at the top of \n\ncliffs in Aran and Shetland Islands (North Sea), and identified inverted boulders exclusively transported by \n\nstorms. Saltation of these boulders during transport was implied by the presence of shatter marks on the \n\nupper limestone ramps on Aran (Williams and Hall, 2004) and by trails of impact marks and chipped edges \n\nvisible on otherwise weathered and lichen-covered surfaces. Hansom et al. (2008) provide modelled \n\nsolutions for the forces of wave impact and subsequent lift at those sites. According to Hall et al. (2006), the \n\ncharacteristics and distribution of cliff top storm deposits allows the definition of wave properties that could \n\ngenerate those boulder accumulations. According to these authors, cliff top storm deposits require full \n\nexposure to storm waves and limited nearshore attenuation. \n\nIn the Portuguese coast, namely in the Cascais-Cabo Raso area, Scheffers and Kelletat (2005) \n\ndescribed isolated boulders and boulder fields they argue to have been deposited by the AD 1755 tsunami. \n\nThe authors also indicate to have observed observed signatures of run-up ca. 50m above mean sea level \n\n(msl) in vegetation scars. They associated those marks and boulder transport to older tsunamis (proposed \n\nas ca. 2400 BP and 6000 BP). Furthermore, Whelan and Kelletat (2005) also observed boulders in Cape \n\nTrafalgar (Spain) that they associated with the AD 1755 tsunami but could not identify any field evidence for \n\nolder tsunamis. Oliveira et al. (2011) combined field, aerial photography and wave data to characterize \n\nquarrying and transportation of two megaclasts weighting 14 and 8t, sitting at present above +1.70m above \n\nmsl in the upper shore platform of Praia das Ma\u00e7\u00e3s (Portugal). Both megaclasts were sourced from the \n\nsame limestone bed seaward from their present location, and were transported landward and upward \n\n(against gravity) for a short distance, and in one case the block was overturned. Through the use of aerial \n\nphotographs the date of transport was constrained between 1965 and 1975. The wave regime affecting this \n\ncoast between 1953 and 2011 indicated high-energy modal conditions and extreme storm waves reached \n\nmaximum Hs of ~13 m in only one occasion, precisely 17th January 1973. \n\nSwitzer and Burston (2010) stated that the imbrication, mixed lithology and sedimentary \n\ncharacteristics of boulder deposits at Little Beecroft Head and Greenfields Beach (Australia) provided \n\ncompelling evidence for large-scale movement attributed to washover by single or multiple events. If the \n\ndeposits were late-Holocene in age then a hypothesisc of higher Holocene sea level must be discarded and \n\nit is likely that storms and tsunami may have both played a role in the development of the high elevation \n\nboulder deposits. However, as in many other sites where boulder deposits transported against gravity have \n\nbeen found, it remains unclear which (i.e. tsunami or storms) was the exact mechanism of emplacement. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n2.2.3. Onshore cobble and gravel deposits \n\nDifferent size-ranged clasts associated with tsunamis and storms are also described in the \n\nliterature. In terms of cobble and peeble deposits (2-256mm diameter - Krumbein and Sloss, 1963) a few \n\nstudies have been conducted over recent years. For example, Morton et al. (2008) analysed coastal gravel-\n\nridge complexes deposited either by tsunamis or hurricanes on islands in the Caribbean Sea. The ridge \n\ncomplexes of Bonaire, Jamaica, Puerto Rico (Isla de Mona) and Guadeloupe consisted of clasts ranging in \n\nsize from sand to coarse boulders derived from the adjacent coral reefs or subjacent rock platforms. The \n\nauthors observed that the ridge complexes were internally organized, displayed textural sorting and a broad \n\nrange of ages indicative of several historical events. Some of the cobble deposits displayed seaward-dipping \n\nbeds and ridge-and-swale topography, whereas other terminated in fans or steep avalanche slopes. \n\nTogether, the morphologic, sedimentologic, lithostratigraphic, and chronostratigraphic evidence indicated \n\nthat ridge complexes were not entirely the result of one or a few tsunamis as previously reported (e.g. \n\nScheffers and Kelletat, 2003) but resulted from several events including not only tsunamigenic but also \n\nstorm/hurricane events. Furthermore, in a nearby region (French West Indies) Caron (2011) used samples \n\nfrom beachrock and non-cemented coarse-grained coastal deposits and applied quantitative textural and \n\ntaphonomic analysis to discriminate different depositional processes associated with storm and tsunami \n\nwaves. \n\nRichmond et al. (2011) in the island of Hawaii identified three distinct coarse-clastic depositional \n\nassemblages that could be recognized based on clast size, composition, angularity, orientation, packing, \n\nelevation and inland distance of each accumulation. These deposits were characterized as: \n\n1) Gravel fields of isolated clasts, primarily boulder-sized, and scattered pockets of sand and gravel \n\nin topographic lows. \n\n2) Shore-parallel and cuspate ridges composed mostly of rounded basalt gravel and sand with \n\nsmall amounts of shell or other biogenic carbonate. The ridges ranged in height from about 1 to 3m. \n\n3) Cliff-top deposits of scattered angular and sub-angular (cobble and gravel) clasts along sea cliffs \n\nthat were generally greater than 5m elevation. \n\nThe authors concluded that the gravel fields were primarily of tsunami origin from either the 1975 \n\nKalapana event, or a combination of tsunamis during 1868 and 1975. The ridge deposits were presently \n\nactive and sediment continues to be added during high wave events. The cliff-top deposits contained \n\nevidences of deposition by both tsunami and storm processes. \n\nCosta et al. (2011) observed spreads of cobbles and boulders (typically with an A-axis of ca. 0.30m \n\nbut some with smaller dimensions) that extended several hundred meters inland and well beyond the \n\npresent landward limit of storm activity in a low-lying area  of the Algarve (Portugal). The marine origin of the \n\nboulders was demonstrated by well-developed macro-bioerosion sculpturing and in situ skeletal remains of \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nendolithic shallow marine bivalves. The authors associated (using radiocarbon age-estimation of Petricola \n\nlithophaga whole shells) the transport of these boulders with the desctructive Lisbon tsunami of AD 1755. \n\n \n\n2.2.4. Onshore fine-grained deposits \n\nMost studied tsunami imprints in coastal stratigraphy are  coarser sand-sized layers within low \n\nenergy finer materials accumulated in depositional basins and exhibiting a distinctive sedimentological \n\nsignature within the stratigraphic column (e.g. Atwater, 1987; Dawson et al., 1988; Atwater and Moore, 1992; \n\nClague et al., 1994; Dawson et al., 1995; Shi et al., 1995; Hindson et al., 1996; Bondevik et al., 1997; \n\nMinoura et al., 1997; Goff et al., 2000; Nanayama et al., 2000; Chagu\u00e9-Goff et al., 2002; Nanayama et al., \n\n2007; Moore et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2007; Paris et al., 2009). This type of depositional arrangement is \n\nindicative of extreme marine inundations because they provide a stratigraphic context and facilitate accurate \n\nspotting and dating of individual events. Fine tsunami or storm deposits are typically sand-sized with a \n\nclearly-defined clay/silt fraction (e.g. Ota et al., 1985; Srinivasalu et al., 2007). The differentiation of tsunami \n\nevents in a clayish stratigraphy was succefully attempted by Andrade et al. (2003) in the Tagus estuary. The \n\ncombine used of sedimentological, magnetic susceptibility, micropaleontological and chronological data \n\nallowed the identification of historical tsunamis that affected the studied areas. \n\nThe identification and differentiation of finer units deposited by tsunami or storms in coastal \n\nstratigraphy requires a multi-proxy approach that mainly focuses on the allochthonous sediment and/or \n\npalaeontological content in order to establish a marine or coastal provenance. Tsunami or storm- \n\ntransported sediment is typically deposited during run-up, even though deposition also occurs during \n\nbackwash and in the period of time between run-up and backwash, usually correspondent to a slack where \n\ncurrents fall to minimum intensity and the directional pattern is ill-defined. Furthermore, in some situations \n\nthe erosional capacity of run-up or the backwash constrains the sedimentary recognition of events by \n\nremoving sediments deposited by earlier tsunami waves. (See sections 2.3 and 2.4). \n\n \n\n2.2.5. Hydrodynamic models of transport of fines, gravel and boulders \n\nField measurements are extremely useful but are somewhat constrained to local experimental \n\nspecificities, thus limiting interpretations. To overcome this restriction various numerical and physical \n\nmodelling exercises have been done in order to shed further light on the properties of tsunami and storm \n\nwaves, as well as, elucidate on the type/size of material that different events are capable of transporting and \n\nalso in the establishment of patterns of fine-grained sedimentation, aiming at developing criteria allowing \n\ndifferentiation between extreme marine inundations. \n\nIn order to distinguish the transport mechanisms associated with tsunami and storms several hydrodynamic \n\nand numerical models have been proposed (e.g. Nott, 1997; Lorang, 2000; Felton, 2002; Nott, 2003; \n\nNoormets et al., 2004; Jaffe and Gelfenbaum, 2007; Morton et al., 2007; Paris et al., 2007; Scicchitano et \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nal., 2007; Tappin, 2007; Hansom et al., 2008; Imamura et al., 2008; Weiss, 2008; Lavigne et al., 2009; Paris \n\net al., 2009; Paris et al., 2010b; Spiske et al., 2010; Switzer and Burston, 2010; Apotsos et al., 2011; Jaffe et \n\nal., 2011; Nandasena et al., 2011a,b). The most cited numerical approach to the differentiation of tsunami \n\nand storm transport mechanisms was proposed by Nott (1997, 2003) and is based in the estimation of \n\nthreshold conditions for initiation of boulders movement under wave action. Nott (1997, 2003) presented a \n\nset of equations relating the forces involved in the transport of submerged, sub-aerial and joint-bounded \n\nboulders in coastal areas. \n\nNoormets et al. (2004) determined the hydrodynamic forces acting on a low submerged shoreline \n\ncliff (in Hawaii) computing wave characteristics based on linear wave theory and experimental results taking \n\ninto account he local wave climate and near-shore bottom topography. Their analyses showed that tsunami, \n\nas well as large swell waves, are capable of quarrying megaclasts, provided that sufficient initial fracturing is \n\npresent. Dislodgement and emplacement most likely occurs in a sequence during impact of a single wave on \n\na coastal cliff. Swell waves however seem to be capable of emplacing large blocks onto the platform due to \n\ntheir rapid disintegration after breaking. They determined that sliding was the most common mechanism of \n\ntransport for larger and irregular megaclasts, whereas somewhat smaller and platy megaclasts where \n\noccasionally found in overturned positions. Inverse models of flow from tsunami deposits (Tappin, 2007) and \n\nforward models of deposits from flow (Gelfenbaum et al., 2007) are relatively new and still under \n\ndevelopment. These models make use of the dependence of sediment transport on the relationship between \n\ngrain size (grain settling velocity) and flow shear stress. Deposition occurs where sediment transport \n\nconverges or when deceleration permits sediment to fall out of suspension. \n\nJaffe and Gelfenbaum (2007) proposed a tsunami sedimentation model based on the analysis of \n\nsand-sized sediment. These authors used the thickness of of tsunami deposits and mean grain particle size \n\nto reconstruct surface flow velocities. Scicchitano et al. (2007) reanalysed the equations proposed by Nott \n\n(2003) using a hydrodynamic approach to determine whether tsunami- or storm-generated waves were \n\nresponsible for coastal boulder deposition in places of the southern coast of Italy. Their results suggested \n\nthat tsunamis were responsible for the detachment and transport of the largest blocks. However, they could \n\nnot exclude that storm waves could also have been responsible for the movement and/or re-orientation of \n\nsmaller-sized blocks, possibly carved out and transported during previous tsunami events. Their analysis \n\nalso confirmed the importance of the pre-transport setting of boulders in determining the height and velocity \n\nof the wave required for boulders to be transported. \n\nPritchard and Dickinson (2008) described a mathematical model of suspended and bedload \n\nsediment transport under long, non-breaking waves running over a plane beach, and used this model to \n\ninvestigate the relationship between the hydrodynamics of swash nd backwash and the resulting erosive and \n\ndepositional processes. They found that sediment transport, both as bedload and  suspended is strongly \n\ncontrolled by asymmetries in the direction of maximum velocity; in the latter case (suspension) transport is \n\nalso affected by settling lag, especially around the point of maximum run-up. The authors concluded that \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\ncombination of these effects appears to preclude simple methods of reconstructing tsunami hydrodynamics. \n\nUsing a similar approach, Weiss (2008) computed the water depth where a passing tsunami wave is able to \n\nmove grains, and estimated the grain size that can be moved at a certain water depth on a sloping beach by \n\na shoaling tsunami wave. According to Weiss (2008), tsunami waves generated by submarine slides or \n\nmeteoritic impacts, unlike those generated by offshore earthquakes, could produce waves with the required \n\nlarger amplitudes. Tsunamis generated by submarine landslides often have very large run-up heights close \n\nto the landslide area, but have more limited far-field effects than earthquake tsunamis (Okal and Synolakis, \n\n2004). \n\nImamura et al. (2008) conducted hydraulic experiments in an open channel with cubic and \n\nrectangular shaped solid blocks to investigate boulder transport by tsunamis and developed a model \n\n(introducing an empirical variable coefficient of friction) that takes into account the various transport modes \n\n(i.e. rolling, saltation, sliding). The authors noted that the blocks were mainly transported by a bore, \n\npredominantly by rolling or saltation rather than by sliding. Imamura et al. (2008), also stated that previous \n\nmodels of boulder transport by tsunamis probably underestimated the distance the boulder travelled by \n\ninfluence of tsunami waves when they were transported by rolling or saltation. The model was tested using \n\nboulders from Inoda (Japan) which were transported by the 1771 Meiwa tsunami. The calculated distance of \n\ntransport of the boulder was approximately 650m, which was consistent with the description in the historical \n\ndocuments. \n\nOn the other hand, Paris et al. (2009) analysing the effects of the Indian Ocean Tsunami (24th \n\nDecember 2004) in Lhok Nga (Indonesia) observed that large tsunami waves (25\u201330m high) were able to \n\ndetach and transport coral boulders in excess of 10t over 500\u2013700m and megaclasts of the rocky platform in \n\nexcess of 85t over a few metres. However, the authors did not observe any landward fining trend in the \n\nboulder size distribution. The spatial and size distributions of tsunami boulder deposits are mostly depended \n\non the location and characteristics of their source (coral reef, beach rock, platform, dams), together with \n\nclast and surface interference during transport. Density also plays an important role in boulder transport, for \n\nexample, a less dense coral boulder buoyed up on water can be more easily transported inland than a more \n\ndense granitic boulder. Furthermore, Spiske et al. (2008) investigated the role of porosity on boulder \n\ntransport and elucidated the distinction between tsunami and hurricane impacts, by performing Archimedean \n\nand optical 3D-profilometry measurements for the determination of accurate physical parameters for porous \n\nreef and coral limestone boulders from the islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao (Netherlands Antilles). \n\nThe authors concluded that the calculated wave heights, the high frequency of tropical storms and \n\nhurricanes in the southern Caribbean and the occurrence of boulders exclusively on the windward sides of \n\nthe islands, implicate that the boulders on those islands are more likely to be hurricane originated. More \n\nrecent work on reefs indicate however that boulder size can also be used to estimate the wave current \n\nvelocities generated in storms and tsunamis (Paris et al., 2009; Goto, 2010b). \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nThe transport mode of boulders from Jervis Bay (Australia) was discussed by Goff et al. (2010b). \n\nThe authors conclude that a better understanding of the critical thresholds for the bed load transport of \n\nboulders is necessary. This issue was addressed for instance by Benner et al. (2010) that discussed \n\nphysical modelling of tsunami and storms boulder transport debating shortfalls in calculations from previous \n\npublished work. Lorang (2010) provided a simple wave-competence approach to determining the likelihood \n\nof one causal mechanism over the other by solving a system of equations to determine wave period in order \n\nto differentiate between tsunamis from wind-generated waves. Lorang (2010) revisited Nott\u2019s equations and \n\nalso used the Hudson formula (United States Army Corps of Engineers, 1984) to estimate wave height for \n\nthe potential wave based on size of the boulder or megaclast. Combining that information with the elevation \n\nabove the initial position and the total horizontal distance of transport, density of the megaclast and assumed \n\nvalues of several coefficients it was possible to estimate the wave period. Furthermore, Apotsos et al. (2011) \n\nproposed a numerical model based on non-linear shallow water equations developed for periodic long \n\nwaves inundating over planar slopes. Simulations were conducted to examine the effects on maximum \n\ntsunami run-up and water velocity of variations in wave characteristics, bed slopes and bottom roughness.  \n\nNandasena et al. (2011a) revised Nott's equations in the sub-aerial and joint-bounded boulder \n\nscenarios and corrected their approach for lift and inertia and incorporated an additional description of the \n\npre-transport location and effects of bottom slope. Calculations were performed in boulders described in \n\npublished accounts and a boulder transport histogram introduced to represent the range of flow velocityies \n\nthat satisfy the requirements for initial transport of a boulder in different modes: sliding, rolling, and saltation. \n\nThe theoretical results were successfully compared to field data. Moreover, Nandasena et al. (2011b) \n\ndiscussed the relevance of clast-to-clast interactions and its impact in transport distance and dissipating the \n\nenergy. The authors concluded that numerical results revealed that drag and friction are the dominant forces \n\napplied to boulders during transport, and therefore, accurate estimation of drag and friction coefficients is \n\nalso important for validation of any transport model. The difference between the simulated results and field \n\nobservations was partly attributed to limitations of the numerical model such as inability to account for \n\nboulder shape, pre-transport environment, microtopographical variation, transport mode, and inaccurate \n\ndefinition of coefficients. \n\nLi and Huang (2011) used three laboratory-based measurements and results from one field survey \n\nfollowing the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami to evaluate the performance of six widely-used sediment transport \n\nformulae (Bagnold; Van Rijn; A-W; Bijker; E-H and Yang) in modelling shoreline change due to tsunamis. \n\nThe performance of these formulae proved to be inconsistent at low and high velocities with none giving \n\nreliable predictions matching both the low and high sediment transport rates observed. \n\n \n\n2.3. Sedimentological features of onshore tsunami deposits \n\nIn this sub-chapter, the criteria used to recognize and differentiate tsunami deposits consisting of \n\nthe finer fraction (i.e. typically sand) is presented. These features/criteria reflect the characteristics of \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\ntsunami waves, transport peculiarities, preservation potential and sedimentary sources. The first studies to \n\nuse geological record to detect prehistoric tsunamis were conducted by Atwater (1987) and Dawson et al. \n\n(1988). Since then many papers have been published discussing several aspects concerning features \n\nassociated with tsunami deposits. The study of modern deposits carried out during immediate post tsunami \n\nsurveys provided the opportunity to refine palaeotsunami diagnostic criteria, without the uncertainty of the \n\ngenerating event and preservation issues due to natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Understandably, \n\nthe number of studies on tsunami sedimentation increased exponentially since the 2004 Indian Ocean event, \n\nbut care should be taken in adopting as of unquestionable universal applicability inferences derived from \n\nresearch on this particular event. Typically, tsunamis can leave sedimentary imprints on shores far from the \n\nevent source, and usually less than a kilometre from the coastline (Dawson and Shi, 2000; Dominey-Howes \n\net al., 2006). Tsunami deposits are usually thicker in topographic lows (areas of spatial deceleration of flows) \n\nand thin over topographic highs (areas of spatial acceleration of flows) (Gelfenbaum et al., 2007). In fact \n\ntsunami sediments can also be eroded during phases of backwash and have also been linked to new \n\nphases of sedimentation during backwash. The preservation of tsunami deposit is a fundamental factor in \n\nany sedimentological study focusing in recurrence intervals of such events. \n\nTappin (2007) discussed sedimentary features associated with tsunami, stressing that the \n\ndevelopment of realistic scenarios of risk requires reliable data on tsunami frequency, which is obviously \n\nconstrained by the sporadic absence of deposit, to which we could add the eventual unability to recognize a \n\nparticular tsunami-deposited layer as such in a given sedimentary sequence. In fact, Szczucinski (2011) \n\nconducted 5 yearly surveys after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and concluded that the post-tsunami \n\nrecovery of coastal zones was generally in the order of a few months to a few years. The study by Nichol \n\nand Kench (2008) in the Maldives found that within 2 years, significant reworking and bioturbation of the \n\ntsunami deposit occurred. The major macroscopic change observed was the fast removal of the thin layer of \n\nvery fine sediments usually representing the top of the tsunami deposits, though such a thin layer consisting \n\nof very fine-grained material has not been reported as ubiquitous in other places worldwide and surveyed \n\nshortly after tsunami inundations. Szczucinski (2011) observed that almost all the near-surface structures of \n\nthe tsunami deposits were removed with time (i.e. after at least 1 rainy season). Tsunami deposits thinner \n\nthan 10cm usually acquired a massive appearance after 1 or 2 years; the only remnants of the primary \n\nstructures, for instance fining upward, having vanished out. This was attributed to bioturbation by growing \n\nroots and burrowing animals like crabs and rodents. A few years earlier Szczucinski et al. (2007) detected \n\nthat tsunami deposits thinner than 1cm were occasionally washed away, the depositional relief was flattened \n\nand deposits at the slopes were partially eroded; and yet, in other locations, the sedimentary bodies, \n\nincluding thin sand laminae, and sedimentary structures, such as lamination and size grading, persisted at \n\ncentury-long timescales (e.g. Washington State, Boca do Rio, Martinhal) following deposition. According to \n\nYawsangratt et al. (2011) micropalaeontological evidences (i.e. carbonate foraminifera) may be subjected to \n\nsignificant dissolution 4.5 years after tsunami emplacement; again, this post depositional disturbance is not \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\nexclusive of tsunami deposits and rapid intrasediment dissolution or downwearing of carbonate foraminifera \n\ntests, ostracoda valves or diatom frustules is a common drawback micropaleontologists working in Holocene \n\nsediments of various facies are used to and aware of, and not exclusive of high-energy events of abrupt \n\nmarine inundation. In this context, it is somewhat surprising that  Lowe and de Lange (2000) suggested, \n\nbased on a study from New Zealand, that a tsunami needs to raise a height of at least 5m in order to leave \n\nany long-term, recognisable sedimentary signature (cf. Goff et al., 2010a). This statement disregards the \n\neffect of sediment concentration in tsunami waves in determining the size and preservation potential of the \n\ndepositional signature, just as a number of other relevant variables, such as the presence of a compatible \n\nsource, accommodation space, rapid capping of the inundation deposit, among other, which are completely \n\nindependent of the tsunami amplitude. \n\nDuring the last two decades, several authors (e.g. Shi and Dawson, 1995; Goff et al., 1998; \n\nGelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003; Dawson and Stewart, 2007; Huntington et al., 2007; Shiki et al., 2008; Switzer \n\nand Jones, 2008; Chagu\u00e9-Goff et al., 2011) have postulated criteria to distinguish (palaeo)tsunami deposits. \n\nThese are described below and summarized in Table 2.2. Dawson and Stewart (2007) discussed the \n\nprocesses of tsunami deposition, identifying the three main aspects that make the depositional process \n\nunique, tsunami source, propagation and inundation. The establishment of source material has been widely \n\nused (e.g. Moore and Moore, 1986; Atwater and Moore, 1992; Dawson et al., 1996; Minoura et al., 1997; \n\nBourgeois et al., 1999; Hindson and Andrade, 1999; Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003; Switzer et al., 2005; \n\nSzczucinski et al., 2006; Babu et al., 2007; Morton et al., 2007; Narayana et al., 2007; Dahanayake and \n\nKulasena, 2008; Higman and Bourgeois, 2008; Morton et al., 2008; Switzer and Jones, 2008 Jagodzinski et \n\nal., 2009; Costa et al., 2009; Paris et al., 2009; Mahaney and Dohm, 2011) because it allows one to \n\nreconstruct the origin and pathway of former tsunami waves. However, it has been commonly reported that \n\ntsunami waves transport essentially sediment that is available in the coastal fringe landward of the boundary \n\ndefined by the seasonal depth of closure of the beach (and coastal) profile (e.g. Atwater and Moore, 1992; \n\nClague and Bobrowsky, 1994; Dawson 1994; Moore et al. 1994; Hindson et al., 1996; Dawson, 2004; \n\nKortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Oliveira et al., 2009; Paris et al., 2010b; Goff et al., 2010a; Costa et al., \n\n2012a,b). In contrast with this, micropalaeontological evidences have indicated either relevant changes in \n\nthe population of Nannoplankton, Foraminifera, Diatoms and Ostracods or that marine species from \n\noffshore/nearshore have been transported inland and deposited by tsunami (e.g. Hemphill-Haley, 1996; \n\nHindson et al., 1996; Patterson and Fowler, 1996; Shennan et al. 1996; Clague et al., 1999; Dominey-\n\nHowes et al., 2000; Chagu\u00e9-Goff et al., 2002; Dawson and Smith, 2002; Abrantes et al., 2005; Dawson, \n\n2007; Horton et al 2007; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Mamo et al., 2009; Sawai et al., 2009; Paris et al., \n\n2010a; Ruiz et al., 2010). Although a site-specific component might be a central feature of any tsunami \n\ndeposits some generalizations are possible interrelated with sedimentary structures, sediment source, \n\npalaeontological, geochemical and geomorphological signatures (Table 2.2). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n2.3.1. Sedimentary structures \n\nIn terms of sedimentological structures, an erosive/sharp/abrupt basal contact is a common feature \n\nand is symptomatic of the energy involved in the emplacement of tsunami deposits. However, this criterion \n\nwas also recognized in storm deposits (Switzer, 2008). The sharp/abrupt/erosive contact of tsunamigenic \n\nlayers were firstly described by Dawson et al. (1988), Moore and Moore (1988) and Minoura and Nakaya \n\n(1991). Bondevik et al. (1997), analysing evidences lay down by the Storegga tsunami in Norway, detected \n\nthat the tsunami deposit rest on an erosional unconformity which in cases has removed more than 1 m of \n\nunderlying sediment. Moreover, Nanayama et al. (2000) observed deposits that resulted from the 1993 \n\nHokkaido-nansei-oki (Japan) tsunami and identified distinctive sharp erosional bases in the tsunamigenic \n\nunit. Gelfenbaum and Jaffe (2003) analysed the erosion and sedimentation associated with the 1998 Papua \n\nNew Guinea tsunami and observed that the beach face and berm showed no evidence of deposition from \n\nthe tsunami. However, on the berm, exposed roots and scour at the base of some palm trees indicated \n\nerosion of approx. 20-30cm of backbeach sand and they observed that only erosional signatures had been \n\nleft by this tsunami to the landward side of the berm, up to about 50m from the shoreline. Chandrasekar \n\n(2005) described erosion of up to 2m over large tracts of beach associated with the return flow of the 2004 \n\nIndian Ocean tsunami. In Thailand, Szczucinski et al. (2005) and (2006), Hori et al. (2007) and Fujino et al. \n\n(2009) observed an erosive sharp basal contact between the tsunamigenic and the underlying layers. \n\nChoowong et al. (2009) also noted that during the same event, erosion and deposition occurred mainly \n\nduring two periods of inflow and that the return flow was mainly erosive. Paris et al. (2009) described erosion \n\nassociated with the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami in Banda Aceh (Indonesia) that extended up to 500m \n\ninland. These authors quantified the overall coastal retreat from Lampuuk to Leupung as of the order of 60m \n\n(ca. 550,000 m2) and locally in excess of 150m. The erosional impact of tsunamis is still controversial, not \n\nonly the recognition of associated patterns in the sedimentary record, other than the erosive base and \n\nquantification of the amount of sediment removed but also the mechanisms and processes associated and \n\nresponsible for the erosional/depositional balance during a tsunami. In fact, Bahlburg and Spiske (2011) \n\nanalysing the sedimentary record of the February 2010 tsunami at Isla Mocha (Chile) observed that the \n\ntsunamigenic unit was produced essentially (i.e. >90%) by the backflow. These authors suggest that due to \n\nthe lack of sedimentary structures, many previous studies of modern tsunami sediments assumed that most \n\nof the detritus were deposited during inflow and an uncritical use of this assumption may lead to erroneous \n\ninterpretations of palaeotsunami magnitudes and sedimentary processes if unknowingly applied to backflow \n\ndeposits. Typically tsunami deposits present sediment size that can vary from mud to boulders and, in many \n\ncases, grain-size variation in tsunami deposits is controlled by the size of sediment available for transport, \n\nrather than by flow capacity (Bourgeois, 2009) or direction. \n\nThe detection of sedimentary structures is limited by sampling methods because coring (which is \n\nfrequently used), in contrast to trench excavation, is in general destructive. Sedimentary structures are also \n\ndifficult to identify in tsunami deposits due to the common deposition as massive deposit (e.g. Dawson et al., \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n1995; Dahanayake and Kulasena, 2008). However, there has been several tsunami deposits where \n\nsedimentary structures including laminae (e.g. Reinhart, 1991; Bondevik, 2003), rip-up clasts (e.g. Dawson, \n\n1994; Shi et al., 1995; Hindson and Andrade, 1999; Bondevik et al., 2003; Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003; Goff \n\net al., 2004; Morton et al., 2007; Paris et al., 2009), cross-stratification (e.g. Choowong et al., 2008) and soft-\n\nsediment deformation (Matsumoto et al., 2008) have been observed. Muddy laminae or organic layers can \n\nrepresent evidence for multiple waves of the tsunami wave train (e.g. Reinhart, 1991; Bondevik 2003). \n\nFurthermore, loading structures at the base of the deposit have been reported in literature (e.g. Dawson et \n\nal., 1991; Minoura and Nakaya, 1991; Costa, 2006; Dominey-Howes, 2007; Martin and Bourgeois, 2012). \n\nAnother peculiar feature observed in many tsunamigenic deposits worldwide is the enrichment in \n\nbioclasts or shells (many of them broken) when compared with the under and overlying layers (e.g. Moore \n\nand Moore, 1988; Bryant et al,. 1992; Albert\u00e3o and Martins, 1996; Imamura et al., 1997; Clague et al.,1999; \n\nDonato et al., 2008) and in cases platy or prolate shell fragments occur aligned suggesting a ghosty \n\nlamination (e.g. Dawson et al., 1995, Hindson et al, 1996, Hindson and Andrade, 1999). For example, \n\nClague and Bobrowsky (1994) observed that tsunami sand deposits commonly include fragments of bark, \n\ntwigs, branches, logs and other plant material. Moreover, Donato et al. (2008) showed that shell features \n\ncould be used as useful indicators of tsunamigenic deposit due to their vertical and lateral extent, to the \n\nallochthonous mixing of articulated bivalve species (e.g. lagoonal and nearshore) out of life position, and to \n\nthe high amount of fragmented valves, with angular breaks and stress fractures. The authors suggested that \n\nthe taphonomic uniqueness of tsunami deposits should be considered as a valid tool for tsunamigenic \n\nrecognition in the geological record. \n\nThe sedimentological fingerprint of currents associated with tsunami events have also been \n\nobserved in the form of parallel lamination, cross-lamination, convolutions and ripple-marks (e.g. Shiki et al., \n\n2008). Moreover, Morton et al. (2007) detected palaeocurrent indicators in tsunami deposits indicating \n\nseaward return flow. In deposits laid down by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, in Thailand, Choowong et al. \n\n(2008) observed capping bedforms and parallel laminae, cross-lamination, rip-up mud and sand clasts. The \n\nauthors also observed normal grading but some reverse grading was locally recognized. According to \n\nChoowong et al. (2008) reverse grading in tsunami deposits indicates a very high grain concentration within \n\nthe tsunami flow, and was possibly formed at the initial stages of inundation in shallow water. Cross-bedding \n\nwas seen as restricted to return-flow sediments (Nanayama et al., 2000). Individual deposits are generally \n\nwell sorted (many are massive) and characterised by sets of fining-upwards sediment sequences that were \n\ninterpreted by Shi (1995) as indicative of deposition by individual tsunami waves. Dawson and Smith (2000) \n\ncharacterised a tsunami sequence in Scotland by several fining upward sequences indicative of a series of \n\ntsunami waves and episodes of backwash. Furthermore, run-up and return flow deposits were also \n\ndifferentiated by Dawson et al., (1996), Nanayama et al., (2000) and Goff et al.,(2001). In the case of the \n\nIndian Ocean tsunami, Paris et al. (2007) observed a landward sequence thinning, fining and sorting. \n\nNormally-graded couplets or triplets of layers were used to identify the run-up of each wave. The topmost \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\nlayers, interpreted as the backwash deposition, describe a seaward sequence of decreasing mean grain-\n\nsize. \n\nThe time lag separating tsunami wave-trains is occasionally marked between different sub-units by \n\nthe presence of mud drapes. Moreover, Fujiwara and Kamataki (2007) observed the presence of a vertical \n\nstack of many coarse-grained sub-layers separated by mud drapes interpreted as due to incremental \n\ndeposition from multiple sediment flows separated by flow velocity stagnation stages and concluded that it is \n\nunlikely that the mud drapes were deposited by short-period storm waves. \n\nMore recently, different techniques have been explored to identify the sedimentary structures in \n\ntsunami deposits. An example of this is ground penetrating radar, used by Switzer et al. (2006) to survey the \n\nerosional contact between an event layer and the under and overlying units. Koster et al., (2011) also used \n\nground penetrating radar in combination with electrical resistivity tomography measurements and \n\nsedimentology for tsunamiite recognition in Greece and Spain. According to these authors, ground \n\npenetrating radar data indicated unconformable thicknesses of tsunamigenic beddings, channel-like \n\nstructures (backwash deposits) and to some extent basal erosion, as well as abrasion-scours in various \n\nplaces, and boulder accumulation inside the deposits (see Table 2.2.) \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Sedimentary sources \n\nSeveral authors have argued that tsunamis are frequently associated with the deposition of \n\ncontinuous and discontinuous sediment sheets across large areas of the coastal zone, provided that there is \n\nan adequate sediment supply (e.g., Dawson et al., 1996; Hindson et al., 1996; Dawson and Shi, 2000). The \n\ndecrease of energy associated with the run-in of tsunami inundations is evidenced in stratigraphic and \n\nsedimentary architecture by the fining inland and thinning inland and ramping upwards of tsunamigenic \n\ndeposits. This is probably the most common feature/criteria to recognize tsunami events in the stratigraphy \n\nof any given coastal area mainly due to the settlement of the particles through the water column, related to a \n\ndecrease of the turbulence of the flow, generally forming fining-upward depositional sequences. Grain size \n\ncharacteristics of the tsunami deposits reflect both the origin of the displaced sediment and hydrodynamic \n\nconditions of sedimentation (Sugawara et al., 2008), with normally graded sand layers related to the \n\ndecrease of the hydrodynamic energy during sedimentation (e.g. Dawson et al., 1988, 1991; Shi et al., 1995; \n\nMinoura et al., 2000). Although not a frequent situation, each fining-upward sequence can be attributed to \n\nindividual tsunami waves as referred to by Ota et al. (1985), Moore and Moore (1988), Clague and \n\nBobrowsky (1994). In contrast, coarsening upwards sequences have also been recognized and were \n\nascribed to the long duration time of the tsunami (Higman and Jaffe, 2005) or high-density flow, as cited \n\nabove. The same authors stated that tsunamis with narrower source regions are more likely to deposit \n\nsediment that is normally graded than those with wider sources who produce more complex deposits. \n\nAlthough local topography plays a decisive role (e.g. Hori et al., 2007) the thickness and mean grain size of \n\ntsunami deposits generally decrease landwards (e.g. Shi et al., 1995; Hindson et al., 1996; Minoura et al., \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\n1997; Dawson and Shi, 2000; Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003; Goff et al., 2004; Paris et al., 2009). Landward \n\ncoarsening deposits have also been exceptionally observed (e.g. Higman and Bourgeois, 2008). In fact, the \n\nsediment texture of tsunami deposits is mostly related to material available for transport in the coastal zone \n\ntsunami deposits can therefore vary immensely from location to location. Differences in the tsunami records \n\npreserved tend to reflect the unique character of each tsunami, and may be attributed to source differences, \n\ncoastal configuration, tide level, and sediment supply. For example, tsunami sediment source has been \n\nattributed to beaches and berms (e.g. Sato et al., 1995; Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003), aeolian grains (e.g. \n\nSwitzer et al., 2006) or to the inner shelf (e.g. Switzer and Jones, 2008). \n\nThe use of heavy minerals to establish provenance of tsunamigenic deposits has also  been \n\ninvestigated by several authors (e.g. Switzer et al., 2005; Bahlburg and Weiss, 2007; Szczucinski et al., \n\n2006; Babu et al., 2007; Morton et al., 2007; Narayana et al., 2007; Higman and Bourgeois, 2008; Morton et \n\nal., 2008; Switzer and Jones, 2008). For example, Bahlburg and Weiss (2007) observed the presence of thin \n\nheavy-mineral concentrations at the base of individual sand layers inferred to have been laid down by \n\ndifferent waves from the same event. Furthermore, Switzer and Jones (2008) identified a mixed heavy \n\nmineral assemblage characteristic of barrier sediments with a component of inner shelf material \n\ncharacterised by immature platy minerals in a tsunami deposit. Morton et al. (2008) observed that vertical \n\ntextural trends showed an overall but non-systematic upward fining and upward thinning of depositional units \n\nwith an upward increase in heavy mineral laminations at some locations. However, most of these studies \n\nwere limited to one study area and also by local differences in source material. Jagodzinski et al. (2009) tried \n\nto compare tsunami deposits, beach sediments and pre-tsunami soils in Thailand. The difference between \n\ntsunami deposits and beach sediments and soils was reflected in differences in the respective proportions of \n\nmica and tourmaline. These differences were attributed to the mode of sediment transport and deposition \n\nwith mica, due to its low density, being more abundant in the topmost part of the tsunami deposit. \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of mainly quartz grains has also been used to establish the \n\nsource material of tsunami deposits (e.g. Bruzzi and Prone, 2000; Dahanayake and Kulasena, 2008; Costa \n\net al., 2009; Mahaney and Dohm, 2011). Bruzzi and Prone (2000) compared SEM microtextural signatures \n\nof quartz grains deposited by the AD 1755 tsunami (Boca do Rio, Portugal) and other quartz grains \n\ndeposited by a storm in the Rhone delta (France) in November 1997. According to the authors, several \n\nfeatures were associated with a specific event (e.g. tsunami) such as upturned plates, fractures and marks \n\nof considerable size. Dahanayake and Kulasena (2008) identified diagnostic criteria to distinguish tsunami \n\nsediments from storm-surge sediments in southern Sri Lanka noting that in tsunami sediments, reworked \n\nmarine microfauna are abundant, quartz sand is not well rounded, and heavy minerals were rare, when \n\ncompared with storm-surge sediments, although they do not explain the reasons underlying these \n\ndifferences. \n\nAnisotropy of magnetic susceptibility has also been used to provenance studies of tsunamigenic \n\ndeposits (e.g. Sugawara et al., 2008; Font et al., 2010; Wassmer et al., 2010) but the application of this \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n27 \n \n\ntechnique is still in its early days and always require that the data produced is normalised in respect of the \n\ngrain size distribution. One example of these studies was conducted by Font et al. (2010) in Boca do Rio \n\n(Portugal) where the magnetic data showed a dominance of paramagnetic minerals (quartz) mixed with \n\nlesser amount of ferromagnetic minerals, namely titanomagnetite and titanohematite both of a detrital origin \n\nand reworked from the underlying sedimentary units. Statistical analyses pointed to a scenario where the \n\nenergy released by the tsunami wave was strong enough to overtop and erode sand from the littoral dune \n\nand mixed it with reworked materials from underlying layers from at least 1m in depth (see Table 2.2). \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Palaeontological signature \n\nMacrofossils and microfossils have been used to identify and interpret sedimentary units as \n\ntsunamigenic. To date, the use of palaeontological characteristics to recognise tsunami deposits has \n\nfocused on diatoms, foraminifera, ostracods, nannoplankton, pollen, molluscs and plant fragments. Typically \n\nthe palaeontological signature is characterized by marked changes in the population indicating the increase \n\nin abundance of marine to brackish fossils and/or the high-energy of the event (e.g. presence of broken \n\nshells, etc.). \n\nDiatoms have been widely used as a proxy to detect extreme marine inundations (e.g. Dawson et \n\nal., 1996 a,b; Hemphill-Haley, 1996; Chagu\u00e9-Goff et al., 2002; Abrantes et al., 2005; Dawson, 2007; Nichol \n\net al., 2008; Sawai et al., 2009). Generally, diatom assemblages in tsunami deposits are chaotic (mixture of \n\nfreshwater and brackish\u2013marine species), because tsunami crosses coastal and inland areas eroding, \n\ntransporting and re-depositing freshwater taxa (Dawson et al., 1996b; Smith et al., 2004). \n\nDawson et al. (1996b) analysed the diatom assemblages contained within tsunami deposits in Scotland, \n\nrelated to the Second Storegga Slide and also associated with Grand Bank tsunami of 1929, and detected \n\nthe presence of exceptionally large numbers of the species Paralia sulcata with most individuals exhibiting \n\nevidence of breakage. Normally, tsunami deposits are characterized by a high percentage of broken valves \n\n(e.g. more than 65%: Dawson et al., 1996b; more than 75%: Dawson, 2007, 90% of pinnate: Dawson and \n\nSmith, 2000; more than 60%: Sawai, 2002). This is in contrast with Sawai et al. (2009) who analysed \n\ndiatoms in tsunami deposits from the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and concluded that the breakage of \n\ndiatom valves was relatively low. Moreover, low breakage of diatoms in tsunami deposits has also been \n\nreported in the Pacific coast of Washington State and Puget Sound, USA (Hemphill-Haley, 1996), and \n\nconsidered to have resulted from rapid sedimentation. At first sight it may appear that large percentages of \n\nbroken diatoms may be indicative of former tsunamis. However, this issue is made problematic since owing \n\nto the varying robustness of lenticular and circular diatoms, tests of some species are more able than others \n\nto withstand fracturing. \n\nIn a study of tsunami sediments deposited by the Papua New Guinea tsunami of 1998, Dawson (2007) \n\nobserved a contrast between the sedimentological/textural data suggesting that the beach shore-face, the \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n28 \n \n\nberm as well as the sand spit were the source of the tsunami deposit. However, the examination of the \n\ndiatom content of the sand suggested that the majority of diatoms were originated from the area immediately \n\noffshore. Benthic marine-brackish species (e.g. Surirella sp., Cocconeis scutellum and Diploneis smithii) \n\nwere dominant within the tsunami sands along the length of transect including the sample furthest inland. \n\nMoreover, in one sample located 200m inland, the presence of the fully marine Triceriatum favus attests to \n\nthe allochthonous (transported) nature of the species within the deposit. \n\nSawai et al. (2009) analysed the diatom assemblages of Phra Thong's (Thailand) 2004 tsunami deposit and \n\nconcluded that it contained surprisingly few freshwater specimens considered to have been a result of strong \n\ncurrents of the tsunami. Turbulent tsunami currents can cause rapid entrainment of a mixture of freshwater \n\nspecies, eroded soil and benthic marine species within a mass of coastal sand. However, if the currents are \n\nvery strong, only benthic marine diatoms attached to heavier sandy substrate are able to settle out of the \n\nwater column. When current velocity slows, the suspended freshwater specimens and soil fractions are able \n\nto settle out of the water column and deposit on top of the sandy, marine diatom-dominated portion of the \n\ndeposit. \n\nForaminiferal content is also a common micropalaeontological proxy that has been used in tsunami \n\nsediment provenance studies  (e.g. Hindson et al., 1996; Patterson and Fowler, 1996; Shennan et al., 1996; \n\nAndrade et al., 1997; Dominey-Howes et al., 1998; Hindson and Andrade, 1999; Clague et al., 1999; \n\nHawkes et al., 2007; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Mamo et al., 2009). Bahlburg and Weiss (2007) \n\nobserved in Kenya that the samples contained abundant tests of benthic foraminifera (Quinqueloculina and \n\nSpiroloculina) typically derived from shallow and protected shelf regions in water depth of less than 30m). \n\nAlso present were several species of Amphistegina sp. including Amphistegina lessonii d\u2019Orbigny which may \n\noccur down to water depths of 80 m. The foraminifera content indicated that the tsunami very likely entrained \n\nmost of the sediment in shallow depths of less than 30m. Hawkes et al. (2007) analysed tsunami deposits in \n\nMalaysia and Thailand, and observed that the pre-tsunami assemblages were mainly composed of intertidal \n\nand inner shelf species (i.e. Ammonia spp., Elphidium hispudula) while the tsunami sediment also contained \n\na minor but important addition of mangrove species, such as Haplophragmoides. wilberti and \n\nHaplophragmoides manilaensis and some radiolarian species. According to the authors, the mangrove and \n\nradiolarian species reflected the chaotic nature of deposition where swash up and backwash combine to \n\ncreate turbulence, mixing the assemblages together. Foraminiferal assemblages within tsunami sediments \n\nwere also able to provide information about sediment provenance and wave characteristics. In one location \n\n(Sungai Burong), species assemblages in the tsunami sediment revealed at least two separate episodes of \n\ndeposition that contained inrushed species from the inner-shelf, as well as backwash species from the \n\nmangrove environment. In the study by Dahanayake and Kulasena (2008), also on the 2004 Indian Ocean \n\ntsunami, more abundant planktonic species such as Globigerinita glutinata, Hantkenina sp. and also benthic \n\nQuinqueloculina sp. as well as Amphistegina lessonii D\u2019Orbigny were detected. Kortekaas and Dawson \n\n(2007) analysing a tsunami deposit in Martinhal (Portugal) noted a clear abrupt change from the brackish \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n29 \n \n\nforaminifera assemblage of the underlying layer to a fully marine assemblage consisting of Elphidium \n\nmacellum, Elphidium crispum, Quinqueloculina seminulum, Cibicides refulgens, Eponides repandus and \n\nAmmonia beccarii var. batavus. \n\nMore recently, Mamo et al. (2009) summarized the many procedures, characteristics and limitations \n\nassociated with foraminiferal assemblages and their use in the recognition of tsunami deposits. \n\nCharacteristics such as changes in assemblage composition (Hindson et al., 1996; Hindson and Andrade, \n\n1999; Hawkes et al., 2007), for example, marine shelf species within a lagoon or brackish environment; \n\nchanges in test size or in juvenile to adult ratios (Guilbault et al., 1996); a shift in population numbers (Cundy \n\net al., 2000; Hawkes et al., 2007; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007); or a change in the taphonomic character of \n\nthe tests (Hindson et al., 1999; Hawkes et al., 2007) can be used to recognise tsunami deposits. Given that \n\nthe exact composition of an assemblage varies from location to location, it is impossible to expect to see a \n\nspecific diagnostic specie(s) or assemblage in association with tsunami-deposited sediments. Some authors \n\n(Dominey-Howes et al., 1998; Nanayama and Shigeno, 2006; Uchida et al., 2007) suggested that given \n\nideal conditions a tsunami deposit might contain deeper water species that would not otherwise be expected \n\nfrom the shallow water. \n\nOstracods have also been used as tsunami indicators (e.g. Ruiz et al, 2010; Mischke et al., 2010). \n\nFor example, Mischke et al. (2010) analysed a tsunami deposit in Lake Hersek (Turkey) and suggested that \n\nthe simultaneous occurrence of ostracods of different origin (lagoonal: Cyprideis. torosa and Loxoconcha \n\nelliptica; shallow marine: Loxoconcha rhomboidea, Xestoleberis sp., Pontocythere sp. and Aurila cf. \n\narborescens; and inland waters: Heterocypris salina and Eucyprinotus cf. rostratus) within beds of brackish-\n\nmarine mollusc shells and fragments indicates that the shell layers were deposited under high-energy \n\nenvironmental conditions (Ruiz et al., 2010). In the case of Lake Manyas (140 km west of Lake Hersek), \n\nostracods of different origins were also interpreted as reflecting an event of large amplitude (seiche) (Leroy \n\net al., 2002). In Hersek, the use of ostracods as tsunami indicators was argued on the basis of: (1) the large \n\nnumber of ostracod shells accumulated during the high-energy events, (2) the higher number of taxa which \n\nis not typical for an undisturbed lagoon setting, and (3) the mixture of ostracod valves with clear marine, \n\nlagoonal and non-marine origin. \n\nChanges in Nannoplankton have also been discussed in association with tsunami deposits (e.g. \n\nAndrade et al., 2003; Paris et al., 2010a). Andrade et al. (2003) observed within the clay/sitl fraction changes \n\nin samples from the Tagus estuary (Portugal) subtle variations (i.e. increases) in calcareous nannoplankton \n\nthat were correlated with magnetic susceptibility, foraminifera and geochemical changes. Paris et al. (2010a) \n\nobserved that a characteristic of the Lhok Nga (Indonesia) tsunamigenic sediments is their nannolith coastal \n\nassemblages despite their relative impoverishment in clay content, which under normal marine \n\nhydrodynamic conditions would prevent nannoliths to settle. The abundance of nannoliths in the 2004 \n\ntsunami deposits tends to decrease landward and upward, despite variations due to successive phases of \n\nerosion/sedimentation by waves (see Table 2.2). \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n30 \n \n\n \n\n2.3.4. Geochemical signature \n\nSeveral studies were conducted in tsunami deposits with the aim of identifying a distinctive \n\ngeochemical signature (e.g. Minoura and Nakaya, 1991; Minoura et al., 1994; Andrade et al., 1998; Goff and \n\nChague-Goff, 1999; Chagu\u00e9-Goff et al., 2002, Andrade et al., 2003; Goff et al., 2004; Srinivasalu et al., \n\n2007; Chagu\u00e9-Goff, 2011). Usually geochemical features of tsunami deposits simply indicate the presence \n\nof saltwater inundation and thus do not provide information on the specific type of inundation. In fact, \n\nincreases in the concentration of chemical elements of marine origin or elements indicative of coarser-sized \n\nsediments have been recognised in the past as a proxy in the study of extreme marine inundations. Newson \n\n(1979) detected increases in the concentration of some elements which was interpreted as evidence of \n\nmarine originated sediment (Ca) and water (Na, Mg, Cl, SO4, K) influx. A similar trend was observed by \n\nMinoura and Nakaya (1991) that also detected increases in Na, Ca, K, Mg and Cl. This was further \n\nsupported by increases in Cl, Na, Ca, SO4 and Mg observed by Minoura et al. (1994). Andrade and Hindson \n\n(1999) were able to detect increases in SiO2 (indicating increase in sand material) CaO (indicating a larger \n\npresence of bioclasts), Cr, MgO, I and Cl (all indicating a marine water influx). On the other hand, increase in \n\nFe and S and dilution of anthropogenic elements were observed by Goff and Chagu\u00e9-Goff (1999) which \n\nsuggested a sudden marine inundation. Van der Bergh et al. (2003) observed the presence of exotic \n\nsediments derived from outer coastal or continental shelf environments that were richer in heavy metals (Pb, \n\nCu, Ni, Fe and Cr) when compared with in-situ sediments. A similar pattern was observed by Szczucinski et \n\nal. (2005) who studied sediments, deposited by the 2004 tsunami in Thailand, and noticed that they \n\ncontained significantly elevated contents of salts (Na+, K+, Ca+2, Mg+2, Cl and SO4) in water-soluble fraction, \n\nand of Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb and As. \n\nAndrade et al. (2003) observed in the Tagus estuary (Portugal) in association with major compositional \n\nbreaks increases in the ratios of SiO2/Al2O3 and CaO/Al2O3 both accompanying increasing carbonate \n\ncontent in comparison with the under and overlying layers. The authors indicated that these elemental pairs \n\nhave similar crystallochemical properties and changes of the ratios should primarily reflect variations in \n\nsediment source. The geochemical data coupled with palaeontological and magnetic susceptibility results \n\nallowed association with tsunami events that had affected that region. \n\nSrinivasalu et al. (2007) reported, in India, a high content of dissolved salts in sediments (Na+, K+, \n\nCa+2, Mg+2, Cl\u2013) indicating that Cu, Pb, Zn were more enriched in the tsunami deposit than the other \n\nneighbouring coastal regions. The geochemical signature is a valuable tool in the tsunami recognition but \n\ncannot be used per si as a diagnostic signature of tsunami deposits. In fact, the changes in geochemistry \n\nobservable in a geochemical profile are mainly due to saltwater inundation, carbonate enrichment (caused \n\nby increase in shells) and changes in sediment source, all these features being also observed in storm \n\ndeposits provided (Table 2.2). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n31 \n \n\n2.3.5. Geomorphological signature \n\nDawson (1994) discussed the importance of changes caused by tsunami in coastal landscapes not \n\nonly by direct tsunami-driven flow orthogonal to the shoreline, but also by episodes of vigorous backwash \n\nand by water flow sub-parallel to the coastline. He suggested that the combined effect of these processes \n\ncould produce coastal landforms dominated by the effects of high-magnitude erosion and deposition. Even \n\nprior to this statement, Andrade (1990, 1992) studied the Ria Formosa (Algarve) barrier chain and noticed \n\nsevere damage of the barrier chain in field observations, supported by cartographic and written documents. \n\nSuch damages included the drowning of the western barrier, truncation of the oriental extremity of the barrier \n\nchain and extensive overwash of two of the eastern barrier islands (Armona and Tavira) accompanied by \n\nfast progradation of the easternmost ribbon of the Algarve sandy coast in the middle 18th century, and \n\nattributed these changes to the AD 1755 earthquake. Andrade (1992) showed that most of the the \n\nbackbarrier surface of Tavira and Armona islands revealed a unique geomorphological pattern, compatible \n\nwith the exceptional overwash event and with the drainage network reorganization process that must have \n\nfollowed the AD 1755 tsunami. \n\nShi and Smith (2003) described evidence for coastal erosion and retreat that occurred along the northern \n\ncoastal line of Flores Island (Indonesia) as a result of the 1992 tsunami. The authors correlated the scale of \n\ngeomorphological changes with the observed tsunami run-up heights over a wide area. Similarly, Regnauld \n\net al. (2004) and Oliveira et al. (2009) described dune erosion caused by multiple tsunami events in New \n\nZealand and to the AD 1755 tsunami in Portugal. Meilianda et al. (2007) presented a quantitative budget of \n\nshoreline sediment fluxes before and immediately after a tsunami in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Through the \n\nstudy of remote sensing images they determined a chaotic shoreline retreat just after the tsunami. In the \n\nfollowing six months 60% of the sediment loss had been compensated by shoreline accretion on the west \n\ncoast of Banda Aceh city whereas further erosion (15% of the sediment loss during the tsunami) occurred on \n\nthe northwest coast. The fact that not all locations showed a beach recovery after the tsunami stresses the \n\nimportance of inner shelf processes and longshore currents in redistributing the sediment eroded at the \n\ncoastline. In the same location, Fagherazzi and Du (2008) revealed that most of the morphological change \n\noccurred in the shore-normal direction, with large volumes of sand removed by the tsunami at the coastline \n\nlater returned to the beach in a short time interval. A series of parallel, tapered incisions widening toward the \n\ncoastline are characteristics of large flooding events such as tsunamis. In fact, flood scour features are \n\nindicator of tsunami events, given their unique morphology with width and depth of the same order of \n\nmagnitude and their sharp boundaries. Goff et al. (2008) recognised region-wide dune remobilisation caused \n\nby tsunami inundation in New Zealand. \n\nIn general terms, and based upon field evidence from 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, inundation by \n\nlarge, region-wide events is likely to cause multiple breaching of dune systems (Higman and Jaffe, 2005). In \n\nother words, multiple tsunami-scour fan assemblages can be formed during a single inundation. The \n\nassemblages could include remnant dune ridges, or pedestals, between each breach, and individual \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n32 \n \n\noverwash fans that could coalesce to form landward sand sheets that may or may not be mobile depending \n\nupon aeolian and dune swale conditions (Goff et al., 2008). If landward sand sheets infill or overlay a \n\nwetland they can stabilise and weather in situ to form a low-profile hummocky topography. If they remain dry \n\nand are exposed to aeolian onshore processes they can form extensive, region-wide parabolic dune \n\nsystems (Goff et al., 2008). Kench et al. (2009) observed that reef islands in the Maldives were \n\ngeomorphically resilient to the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami with the most immediate impacts \n\nbeing relatively minor with reductions in island area ranging from&lt;1% to 9%. Overwash deposits, in the form \n\nof sand sheets and sand lobes, as well as strandlines and individual clasts of coral rubble, were the most \n\ncommon accretionary forms. These deposits represented a net addition to island surfaces, although their \n\npreservation potential as tsunami signatures may be low. \n\nSee summary of tsunamigenic geomorphological signatures in Table 2.2. \n\n \n\nSummary:  \n\nIn summary, it is important to note that the criteria to recognize tsunami deposits (see Table 2.2) are still, at \n\nthe present state of knowledge, ambiguous. Although the conjunction of the identification of sedimentary \n\nstructures, the establishment of source material, the micropalaeontological analysis, geochemical \n\ncharacteristics and the study of geomorphological imprints in coastal landscape facilitates the identification \n\nof tsunami deposits; even if erosion and preservation is constrained by several facts. In fact, the \n\ncontrast/peculiarity of the tsunami layers, especially when compared with under and overlying layers, \n\nprovides in many cases the conclusive evidence for the recognition of such deposits. Data is commonly \n\nobtained through the use of sedimentologoical techniques - some have been widely used (e.g. textural and \n\ngeomorphological) while others have been scarsely applied (e.g. microtextural analysis and heavy mineral \n\nassemblages); both have been used in modern tsunami sediments as well as in palaeotsunamis. Based in \n\nthe references summarized in this sub-chapter and in Table 2.2 it is possible, through the use of diverse \n\nsedimentological proxies, to obtain information about the presence or absence of tsunami indicators, to \n\nestablish their likely source or to collect valuable information about tsunami run-up, backwash or wave \n\npenetration inland. Recent events in Sumatra and Japan have been used to further develop the application \n\nand definition of sedimentary criteria to be used in the identification of tsunami deposits. However, in the \n\nstudy of palaeotsunamis a group of other questions (e.g. understanding mechanisms of inundation and \n\ndeposition for each specific location, preservation of sedimentary structures and palaeontological evidences) \n\nstill needs to be addressed in future studies in order to contribute to the development of more detailed and \n\nrigourous criteria that can further contribute to the accuracy of hazard maps. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n33 \n \n\nTable 2.2 - Table summarizing the criteria to identify and differentiate tsunami deposits. \n\nCriteria Features (from selected references) \n\nPhysics \n\nVery long wave length \n\nVery high velocity and speed current \n\nFew waves but with backwash \n\nSwift inundation with high shear stress and erosion \n\nSedimentary structures \n\n(requires stratigraphic \n\ncontext/analysis) \n\nErosional/abrupt/sharp/unconformity basal contact \n\nMassive/chaotic unit \n\nNormal grading (in places repeated) \n\nUnit with several laminae \n\nCross-stratification \n\nSoft-sediment deformation \n\nLoading structures \n\nParallel lamination or cross-lamination \n\nConvolutions \n\nRipple-marks \n\nMud drapes \n\nRip-up clasts \n\nBroken shells \n\nSediment source \n\n(requires multiple source \n\nanalysis) \n\nTypically reflects the material available in the coastal fringe \n\n(i.e. beaches and berms, aeolian, inner shelf landward of closure depth) \n\nGrain size range from mud to boulders \n\nMulti-modal grain-size distribution indicating multiple sources \n\nIncrease of heavy mineral concentration in the base of the deposit \n\nIncrease of platy minerals (i.e. micas) in the top of the deposit \n\nSEM microtextural imprints suggest increased presence of percussion/mechanic marks \n\nPalaeontological features \n\n(requires stratigraphical, \n\npalaeoecological  and source \n\nanalysis) \n\nMarked changes in Diatoms, Foraminifera, Ostracods, Nannoplankton, Pollen \n\n(usually presenting either a chaotic assemblage or a wider range of species and, in cases, \n\noffshore/nearshore species) \n\nGeochemical signatures \n\n(requires source analysis) \n\nIncrease inf Cl, Na, Mg, Ca, K, SiO2, CaO, Cr, MgO, I, Fe, S \n\nIncreases in the ratios of SiO2/Al2O3, CaO/Al2O3 \n\nIncrease in carbonate content (shell) \n\nSubtle variations in source-sensitive elements: K/Rb, La/Sm and Hf/Ta \n\nEnrichment in Cu, Pb, Zn or, in contrast, dilution of anthropogenic elements \n\nGeomorphological aspects \n\n(requires regional context) \n\nMultiple breaching of dune systems or individual overwash fans \n\nDune ridges and sand dune pedestals \n\nLandward sand sheets \n\nHummocky topography \n\nParabolic dunes \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n34 \n \n\n2.4. Sedimentological features of onshore storm deposits \n\n(palaeotempestology) \n\nThe understanding of storm processes, their depositional and preservation potential in coastal \n\nsedimentary sequences is until the present moment still poorly documented. There are several references to \n\nstorm deposits (tempestites) in the sedimentary record some associated with older events (e.g. Rossetti, \n\n1997; Weidong et al., 1997) other with more recent (i.e. Holocene and present day) events (e.g. Liu and \n\nFearn, 1993; Jelgersma et al., 1995; Otvos and Carter, 2008; Etienne and Paris, 2010; Dezileau et al., \n\n2011). Moreover, in the literature it can be found, similarly to tsunami deposits, references to boulder and to \n\nfiner (typically sand-sized) deposits again in the dependence of event characteristics and sedimentary \n\nsource. \n\nThe study of storm deposits appears many times as a complementary tool to the establishment of \n\nstorminess patterns associated with climatic changes (e.g. Donnelly et al., 2001; Andrade et al., 2008; \n\nAlmeida et al., 2011). In fact, the study of tempestites provided grounds for the development of a new field of \n\nscience: Palaeotempestology. This new area of research was greatly developed by the work of Liu and \n\nFearn (1993), Liu and Fearn (2000), Donnelly et al. (2001), Donnelly et al. (2004), Liu et al. (2008), Switzer \n\nand Jones (2008), Etienne and Paris (2010) and Paris et al. (2011b) and it has been defined as \u201cthe \n\nreconstruction of past extreme events from sedimentary or erosional evidence left in the landscape as a \n\nresult of storm surge and wave action\u201d (Nott, 2003). Palaeotempestology is based in the analysis of the \n\nsedimentary record of storms/hurricanes/typhoons and is used to extend the historical record through the \n\nuse of geological data and provide further knowledge to recurrence analysis. Palaeotempestological \n\nresearch has mainly focused in low latitude (i.e. hurricane prone) areas, for instance in back-barrier \n\nenvironments on siliclastic coasts (Switzer and Burston, 2010) including areas of tropical cyclones in \n\nnorthern Australia (e.g. Chappell et al., 1983; Chivas et al., 1986; Hayne and Chappell, 2001), southern and \n\neastern United States (e.g. Collins et al., 1999; Donnelly et al., 2001; Liu and Fearn, 1993, 2000), and to a \n\nlesser extent throughout the south Pacific islands (e.g. Mckee, 1959). Furthermore, records of storms have \n\nalso been identified in the internal stratigraphy of coastal dune systems (Jelgersma et al., 1995). Zong and \n\nTooley (1999) suggested that reliable storm-surge signatures can only be developed by using appropriate \n\nanalytical techniques, such as determining the particle-size distribution of the storm layers and comparing \n\nthem to associated/under and overlying non-storm sequences (Delaney and Devoy, 1995). This later \n\nsentence confirms that textural contrast is one of the criteria that have been used to identify storm deposits. \n\nOver the past two decades, a growing list of palaeotempestology studies, including some that are supported \n\nby the comparison with modern analogue events, have confirmed that overwash sand layers within the \n\nstratigraphy of coastal lakes and marshes can be a reliable proxy for major storm events. \n\nA number of sediment-based proxies have been developed such as cyclone surge-constructed \n\nbeach ridges (Nott and Hayne, 2001; Nott et al., 2009) and overwash deposits preserved in back barrier \n\nlagoons (Donnelly, 2005; Donnelly and Woodruff, 2007; Wallace and Anderson, 2010), coastal lakes (Liu \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n35 \n \n\nand Fearn, 1993, 2000; Lambert et al., 2003, 2008), and marshes (Donnelly et al., 2001, 2004; Boldt et al., \n\n2010). Liu and Fearn (1993) have shown from coastal Alabama, U.S.A., that a series of hurricanes during \n\nhistorical time deposited multiple sand layers across low-lying coastal wetlands. Similarly, Davis et al. (1989) \n\nargued that hurricanes produced graded or homogeneous deposits of sand, shell, gravel and mud within the \n\nprominently clastic sediments in the coastal lagoons of Florida. Storm deposits can leave a sheet like \n\ndeposit extending a few hundred of m inland. For instance the Hurricane Ivan (2004) deposit extended 200\u2013\n\n300m while Katrina expanded up to a maximum 450m width (Otvos and Carter, 2008). It has been observed \n\nthat storms can cause localized erosional surfaces in lagoonal and lake deposits. Such surfaces also \n\noccurred near the lakeward ends of storm breaches, inlets and elsewhere in coastal basins (Donnelly and \n\nWoodruff, 2007; Woodruff et al., 2009). Rip-up clasts and scours in tidal marsh deposits also reflect storm \n\nerosion. Furthermore, Donnelly et al. (2001) demonstrated that recent and historic major hurricanes on the \n\nUnited States Atlantic coast left a stratigraphically distinct and regionally consistent record of overwash sand \n\nlayers in the sediments of the coastal marshes. In terms of sediment source Lu and Liu (2005) studying \n\nhurricane events in Alabama (United States) concluded that the tempestite sand layers are similar to those \n\nfrom the dune environments, thus suggesting that they were transported from the dunes by overwash \n\nprocesses. More recently Lambert et al. (2008) proposed the use of organic geochemical proxies as a new \n\ntool in palaeotempestology, utilizing isotope ?13C and ?15N concentrations and ratios in organic-enriched \n\nmuds. The changes observed in these isotopes were attributed to specific storm events. \n\nThe use of palaeotempestology data to establish frequency of events and minimum wave heights of \n\nextreme marine inundations has been applied with success, for instance, in the eastern coast of the United \n\nStates.  Boldt et al. (2010) presented a 2000 year record of overwash deposition preserved in a backbarrier \n\nsalt marsh from south eastern New England (United States) and were able to establish that during the last \n\nca. 375 years only historical hurricanes with surges of at least 2m were preserved in the Mattapoisett Marsh \n\nsediments. A similar study was conducted by Lane et al. (2011) in Mullet Pond, Florida (United States). In \n\nthis study, a 4500 year record of Holocene hurricane storm surges was obtained. The record with sub-\n\ndecadal resolution allowed the establishment of an average event frequency of 3.9 storms per century, \n\ngreater than that of any published palaeohurricane record. The authors acknowledge that although the \n\nlargest historic hurricane events were represented in the record, some smaller events went undetected \n\nresulting in an underestimate of the number of storms impacting the site through time. The authors also \n\nobserved that shallow, benthic foraminifera (living in depths of 1 to 5m below msl, i.e. up to 3 to 5 km \n\nseaward of the shoreline) were present in deposits associated with the AD 1941 hurricane and possibly \n\nDennis (AD 2005). McCloskey and Keller (2009) studied six major hurricanes that were detected in the \n\nsedimentary record of the past 500 years along the central coast of Belize representing 1 to 1.2 catastrophic \n\nstorms every 100 years in the study area. \n\nThe majority of palaeotempestites have been observed in the United States eastern coast due to \n\nmore intensive research, favourable sedimentary basins that can retain the sedimentary deposits and to the \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nmore hurricane-prone climatic conditions. In addition, the large width and extreme low-gradient of the shelf \n\nand morphological continuum in features characterizing the shelf and the extensive adjacent low-lying \n\ncoastal areas favour the development of intensive surges in association with tropical storms. In Europe \n\nsimilar deposits have been described, such as reported by Jelgersma et al. (1995), which observed shell \n\ndeposits found in dune fields at five different sites along the central Netherland coast and associated these \n\ndeposits with several Holocene storm surge events. Andrade et al. (2004) tested the geological record of \n\nstorminess through the analysis of a group of five marsh detached beaches and one active marginal beach \n\nin the Ria Formosa barrier islands (Portugal) area using sedimentological, paleoecological (Foraminifera and \n\nDiatoms), geometrical and stratigraphical information derived from sediment cores which were interpreted by \n\ncomparison with present-day analogues. They concluded that the lithostratigraphical framework indicated \n\nthat multiple sand bodies were present in some cores, with limited lateral extension and separated by muddy \n\nlagoonal sediments indicating that distinct episodes of entrainment of marine sand into the lagoonal space \n\nalternated with low-energy sedimentation. In the same region, Matias et al. (2008) studied 28 storm events \n\nduring a 3 year study period (2001-2004). Depending on the volume state of the barrier island, storm waves \n\ncaused either erosion of the beach (net negative supratidal sedimentary balance) or promoted intense \n\noverwash that contributed to barrier enlargement by extensive sedimentary deposition (overwash). Ruiz et \n\nal. (2007) studied the Holocene infilling of the Odiel estuary (Gulf of Cadiz) using lithological, stratigraphical, \n\ngeochemical, and palaeontological data which allowed the recognition of the oldest known Holocene storm \n\nin this area (ca. 5705 14C years BP). In this area, the geological record of storm events is constituted by: (a) \n\nsandy layers with basal erosional surfaces interlayered in muddy sediments; (b) new beach ridges added \n\nperiodically to sandy spits; or (c) lumachellic layers of mollusc shells interbedded within massive, bioturbated \n\nlevels. Dezileau et al. (2011) studied the Languedoc\u2013Roussillon region (French Mediterranean coast) and \n\nidentified four distinct, overwash deposits at more than 500m from the sandy barrier. The authors \n\ndemonstrated that the geomorphic setting of the studied area has not changed drastically during the last \n\n1500 years, and attributed these four overwash deposits to catastrophic storms of category 3 intensity or \n\nmore. \n\nStorms surveys conducted immediately after the events have been carried out throughout the \n\nworld. Two examples of those campaigns and the recognition of sedimentary imprints left by storms are \n\ndescribed by Dawson et al. (2007) and Horton et al. (2009). Horton et al. (2009) collected data from \n\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita storm surges along the Alabama and Mississippi (United States) coastline. \n\nGround surveys of local topography, storm surge high water marks and flow direction were conducted. In \n\nMississippi, Hurricane Katrina storm surge extended inland more than 750m. The differences between the \n\npre-storm surge and storm surge sediment were defined by the following characteristics: erosional boundary \n\nbetween sedimentary units accompanied by a change in colour and a change in lithology; and the storm \n\nsurge sediment was coarser than the pre-storm surge unit and with lower organic content. The thickness of \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n37 \n \n\nthe Hurricanes Katrina and Rita storm surge sediments ranged from 7 to 13cm. Foraminiferal analyses in all \n\nthree sites revealed a virtual absence of tests within the storm surges sediments. \n\nDawson et al. (2007) analysed the coastal changes observed in the Hebrides Islands (Scotland) associated \n\nwith the Great Storm of January 2005. The hurricane-force winds together with a storm surge resulted in \n\nsignificant change in coastal landscape along the entire western seabord and, in particular, on headlands \n\n(Angus and Rennie, 2007). In general, severe erosion was focused along coastal areas located west of the \n\ncauseways that link North Uist and Benbecula, Benbecula and South Uist and South Uist and Eriskay. \n\nAccording to Dawson et al. (2007) the coastal response to the storm was complex. In some areas, coastal \n\ndunes were subject to significant retreat. In other areas deposition of shingle and even boulders was \n\nobserved. In both cases described above erosion and deposition (of material available in the coastal fringe) \n\nwas observed in association with overwash caused by major storm events. \n\nFrom all of the above it can be stated that storm overwash is undoubtedly a powerful agent in \n\nbeach and dune erosion and backbarrier sand accumulation. Typical washovers generally consist of fan- or \n\nsheet-like subaerial to subaqueous accumulations of sand supplied by storm overwash from the nearshore \n\nareas and supratidal sediment resident on barrier island and mainland surfaces. Of highly variable thickness, \n\nthese sequentially developed landforms are mutually superimposed during consecutive storm events by \n\nsediment gravity flow influenced by fluid effects (Middleton and Hampton, 1973). Washovers or overwash \n\nfans are elongated lobate, parabola- and flame-shaped landforms. Factors that influence the dimensions \n\nand outlines of fans and related overwash bedforms include wind-induced surge elevation, astronomical tide, \n\nwave setup and run-up, the intensity and duration of channelled flow, the presence of topographic \n\nobstructions, and the volumes of sand in the shoreface and beach with dunes that are available for erosion \n\nand subsequent deposition by overwash (Donnelly et al., 2001; Boldt et al., 2010). Sedgwick and Davis \n\n(2003), Morton et al. (2007) and Horton et al. (2009) recognized multiple sedimentary structures related to \n\ndeposition of individual overwash units. Sand and mud layers of contrasting clast dimensions and microfossil \n\n(Foraminifera and Diatoms) content formed these beds. \n\nMost of Holocene fine grain-sized storm deposits have been discussed in comparison with tsunami events. \n\nStorm deposits are difficult to distinguish from tsunami deposits because, similar to the latter, they also may \n\ncontain marine or brackish water macro and microfossils, retain saltwater geochemical imprints, and thin and \n\nfine landward (Nelson et al., 1996). Some studies use distance inland to indicate a tsunami source, arguing \n\nthat it is not likely that storm waves or surge could deposit sand inland to the extent indicated by a number of \n\ndeposit atributed to be of tsunami origin (Clague et al., 2000). When layers of both events are present in the \n\nsame location their number and thickness have sometimes been used to differentiate between a tsunami \n\nand a storm genesis (Williams and Hutchinson, 2000). Tsunami deposits tend to have several relatively thick \n\nnormally graded beds, suggesting deposition from graded suspension by successive waves in the tsunami \n\nwave train, whereas storm deposits may be expected to have thinner and more numerous laminations, from \n\nhigher frequency but lower energy storm waves (Nelson et al., 1996). Moreover, Abramson (1998) uses the \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n38 \n \n\npresence of rip-up clasts in the deposit to indicate the higher energy deposition of a tsunami although this is \n\nin contrast with other findings (e.g. Switzer, 2008). \n\nRecently, a number of papers revisited the issue of distinguishing tsunami and storm deposits (Nanayama et \n\nal., 2000; Goff et al., 2004; Tuttle et al., 2004; Morton et al., 2007; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Switzer \n\nand Jones, 2008). Nanayama et al. (2000) described deposits associated with the 1993 Japan Sea tsunami \n\nand the 1959 Miyakojima typhoon in the same location in the Hokkaido coast, Japan. The main differences \n\ndetected were that the tsunami deposit consisted of four beds, showing evidence of bidirectional currents \n\nassociated with land- and seaward flow of the two main waves and contained marine sand, gravel, seashells \n\nand eroded soil. In opposition, the storm deposit showed a unidirectional current, contains foreset bedding \n\nand was better sorted than the tsunami deposit. Bryant and Nott (2001) compared geomorphological \n\nimplications of tsunami and storms. They make the point that storms tend to only surge through gaps in \n\ndunes, sporadically depositing lobate fans that rarely penetrate far inland. This can be considered as a key \n\ndifference between storm and tsunami geomorphology but this is more controversial in areas of low \n\naccumulation space (e.g. in a small pocket beach, there may be insufficient longshore and landward \n\naccumulation space for more than one lobate fan and two pedestals) (Goff et al., 2008). \n\nGelfenbaum et al., (2002) suggested that \u201cIn the absence of a historically-documented context, \n\nand/or the preservation of both types of deposit at the same location, researchers must make comparisons \n\nbetween the studies of the sedimentary records of individual storm and tsunami deposits from widely \n\nseparated sites around the world\u201d. Indeed, one should have in consideration the countless site-specific \n\nvariables such as sediment supply, nearshore bathymetry and coastal topography. Tuttle et al. (2004) \n\ncompared the deposits of the AD 1929 Grand Banks tsunami with the AD 1991 Halloween storm in \n\nMassachusetts, in the eastern coast of the United States. The tsunami deposit had one to three sub-units of \n\nmassive or normal graded sand, whereas the storm deposit showed lamination, delta foreset stratification \n\nand sub-horizontal, planar stratification with channels. The tsunami deposit can be traced further inland and \n\nto a higher elevation than the storm deposit. However, because both deposits were not found at the same \n\nlocation, differences due to site-specific variations have to be considered. \n\nGoff et al. (2004) compared a 15th century tsunami deposits and sediments emplaced by an Easter 2002 \n\nstorm. Both deposits are peculiar in local extent, thickness, and grain size. According to Goff et al. (2004) \n\nthe main differences can be summarized as follows: \n\n(a) The tsunami deposit thins abruptly at the margins and fines inland as opposed to exhibiting the \n\nhighly variable characteristics of the storm deposit with a marked coarsening at its landward extent. \n\n(b) The storm deposit is slightly better sorted and coarser than the tsunami deposit. A coarser grain \n\nsize is probably the result of differences in sampling regime as opposed to wave energy, while a better \n\nsorting reflects the wider range of grain sizes entrained by the tsunami both on land and onshore. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n39 \n \n\n(c) Differences in the landward characteristics of these inundation events are reflected in the \n\ncontrast between the erosional contact and entrainment of rip-up clasts of the tsunami and the sharp contact \n\nof the storm deposit. Both are associated with buried soils and/or vegetation, but only the tsunami \n\npenetrated far enough inland to affect archaeological material. \n\n(d) Variations in the preservation of evidence are a reflection of the age of deposition. \n\n \n\nMorton et al. (2007) suggested some differences between tsunami and storms based on only two \n\ntsunami deposits (from Peru and Papua New Guinea) and two storm surge deposits (from Texas and North \n\nCarolina). The clear suggestion from their work is that tsunamis and storm deposits have much more \n\nsimilarities than differences. Kortekaas and Dawson (2007) analysed a group of samples from Martinhal \n\n(SW Algarve, Portugal). The authors recognised tsunami deposits (associated with the AD 1755 event) and \n\nseveral, more recent, storm deposits in this location. The authors concluded that Foraminifera assemblages \n\nand grain size characteristics are almost identical in both type of events although tsunami deposits present \n\nhigher concentration of Foraminifera and some boulders with borings of molluscs. The main difference \n\ndetected was the inland extent of the tsunami deposit when compared with the storm events. Switzer and \n\nJones (2008) tried to establish the source of a marine deposit detected in a closed freshwater back-barrier \n\nlagoon on the southeast Australian coast. Their studies were based on comparisons with modern storm \n\ndeposits from the same coast and sedimentological diagnostic criteria derived from studies of modern storm- \n\nand tsunami-deposited sandsheets (Figure 2.2). \n\nDahanayake and Kulasena (2008) compared tsunami, storm-surge and nearshore sediments. The \n\nauthors detected that storm surge sediments were better sorted than all the tsunami samples studied. The \n\nrelatively high heavy mineral content and the scarce presence of open marine microfossils also helped to \n\ndiagnose the storm-surge sediments. Morton et al. (2008) studied coastal gravel-ridge complexes deposited \n\non islands in the Caribbean Sea as recorders of past extreme-wave events that could be associated with \n\neither tsunamis or hurricanes. The ridge complexes of Bonaire, Jamaica, Puerto Rico (Isla de Mona) and \n\nGuadeloupe consist of polymodal clasts ranging in size from sand to coarse boulders that are derived from \n\nthe adjacent coral reefs or subjacent rock platforms. Ridge-complex morphologies and crest elevations are \n\nlargely controlled by availability of sediments, clast sizes, and heights of wave run-up. Together, the \n\nmorphologic, sedimentologic, lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic evidences indicated that shore-\n\nparallel ridge complexes composed of gravel and sand that are tens of m wide and several meters thick are \n\nprimarily storm-constructed features that have accumulated for a few centuries or millennia as a result of \n\nmultiple high-frequency intense-wave events. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n40 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 - Schematic summary diagram of different characteristics of tsunami and storm surge: in the ocean, at the coast, \nduring run-up and inundation, along with a basic description of the resulting sediments. (Switzer and Jones, 2008). \n\n \n\nThe recognition of tsunami boulder deposits has been previously discussed in this thesis. The \n\ncomplex processes associated with the transport inland and upwards of boulders and their association with \n\na specific type of marine inundations requires, almost on every occasion, the use of hydrodynamic equations \n\nto establish wave height or velocities (e.g. Nott, 2003) and associate them with specific events. \n\nMore recently, Goto et al. (2011) stressed once again the importance of the development of precise \n\nnumerical modelling of boulder transport as a key method to assist in discriminating between tsunami and \n\nstorm wave boulders. While these models are still being developed by the scientific community is fairly \n\nrelevant that the definition of sedimentological criteria to differentiate tsunami and storm deposits is \n\nenhanced and developed. Hall et al. (2006) characterized cliff-top storm deposits of the Atlantic coasts of the \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n41 \n \n\nBritish Isles and were able to recognize that these deposits form a distinctive end member to the much \n\nlarger group of coarse clastic storm features. The authors concluded that the detailed configuration of the \n\ncoast, particularly the size, height, orientation and form of the cliff edge and top, exerts a major control on \n\nthe distribution, altitude, clast orientation and clast size of the storm cliff-top deposits. Etienne and Paris \n\n(2010) provided a new insight for the interpretation of boulder deposits by highlighting the geomorphic \n\neffects of powerful storms. The authors observed that during the winter of 2008 in Iceland boulders up to 16t \n\nwere transported inland. However, the authors concluded that notwithstanding the drastic seasonal \n\nindividual changes, at a larger scale, boulder deposits (beaches or ridges) are landforms with a strong \n\npermanence in the landscape over years. Also recently, Paris et al. (2011b) edited a review on boulders and \n\nmegaclasts deposited by storm waves on rocky coasts. The authors discussed the possibility of storm \n\nevents as likely mechanisms for boulder transport in high and temperate latitudes. \n\nRecent studies (Goto et al., 2010a, 2010b; Etienne and Paris, 2010; Richmond et al., 2011) have \n\nproposed that tsunami and storm boulder deposits can be differentiated by considering the position relative \n\nto source, size, distance travelled and breakage of boulders. They suggested that the approach of coupling \n\nsedimentology and geomorphology can be applied to other boulder fields, but requires further testing in \n\nother locations. Goto et al. (2011) studied the emplacement and movement of boulders by known storm \n\nwaves based in field evidences from Okinawa Island, Japan. They concluded that no single method to \n\ndiscriminate boulders deposited by the tsunami or storm waves appears to be universally applicable to all \n\ncases in the world. Nevertheless, the authors discuss the possibility that boulders can be discriminated in \n\neach case when local complexities of waves, topography, and characteristics of boulders are considered. \n\nThe few studies specifically designed to compare characteristics of historical tsunami and storm \n\nfiner grained deposits (e.g. Nanayama et al., 2000; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Goff et al., 2004; Tuttle et \n\nal., 2004; Switzer and Jones, 2008) were conducted at the same or nearby sites. This eliminated or reduced \n\ninter-site sediment and landscape variability but prevented the comparison of impacts of events of similar \n\nintensities, elsewhere. In conclusion, storm deposits share many textural, palaeontological, geochemical and \n\ngeomorphological characteristics with tsunami deposits making their differentiation a complex task. This is \n\nalso further complicated by studies addressing storm activity but not clearly separating storm surge from \n\nstorm wave impacts and sedimentation. The diversity of topographic, hydrodynamic, and sedimentological \n\nsettings as well as post-depositional settings account for major difficulties in correlating individual sand \n\nlayers with specific prehistoric storm events. This complicates or prevents identification of specific events, \n\ntheir velocity categories, calculations of recurrence interval probabilities and accurate risk assessment. The \n\ndifferentiation of tsunami and storm deposits is of crucial importance for studies of hazard risk and the \n\ndevelopment and improvement of sedimentary criteria is a scientific requisite. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n42 \n \n\n2.5. Record of tsunami and storm deposits in the study areas \n\n2.5.1. Atlantic Iberia \n\nSeveral onshore and some offshore tsunami deposits have been detected in this region. Most of \n\nthe deposits have been described in association with the AD 1755 tsunami although deposits associated \n\nwith older events have also been described (Figure 2.3). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Locations where some tsunami deposits have been described along the Atlantic Iberia coastline (sandy \ndeposits numbered in red; boulder deposits numbered in black). 1: Aveiro - Corrochano et al. (2000); 2: Tagus estuary - \n\nAndrade et al. (2003); 3: Cascais - Scheffers and Kelletat (2005); 4: Tagus prodelta - Abrantes et al. (2005, 2008); 5: Huelva \nestuary - Morales et al.

(2009); 15: Ria \n\nFormosa - Andrade (1992). \n\nIn the western coast of Portugal, there are references to the AD 1755 tsunami washover deposits in the \n\nAveiro lagoon (Corrochano et al., 2000), to silt-clay sedimentation in the Tagus estuary (Andrade et al., \n\n2003) and erosion and deposition of coarser material in the Tagus prodelta (Abrantes et al., 2005; 2008). \n\nFurthermore, in the Guincho area (W of Lisbon), Scheffers and Kelletat (2005) detected a number of \n\nmegaclasts and attributed their displacement to tsunamigenic mechanisms of different ages including the AD \n\n1755 tsunami, although the absolute age-estimation they have used is controversial. In addition to \n\nmegaclasts they described boulder fields and ridges standing at heights of more than 10m above msl \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n43 \n \n\nbearing evidences of having been moved inland from the source region and thus associated to one or more \n\ntsunami events that affected this region. The authors also argue to have found a vegetation scar and beach \n\nsand with perfectly rounded pebbles in the same area of tsunami origin. Approximately 40 km to the north of \n\nCascais (i.e. Praia dos Coxos-Ericeira) a peculiar limestone boulder accumulation was identified in a rocky \n\nplatform and the possibility of its transport and deposition by one or multiple tsunami events has been \n\ndiscussed (Oliveira, 2011). Andrade et al. (2003) found evidences in sediment cored from the Tagus \n\nmarshes that were correlated with the AD 1755, AD 1531 and with one older event tentatively dated of the \n\n14th century AD. The techniques used include vertical variation of the bulk magnetic susceptibility, \n\ngeochemistry, nannoplankton (abundance and diversity) and a range of sedimentological proxies. The \n\nevidences were provided by the changes detected in those units laid down by high energy marine events. \n\nThese changes included slight increases in SiO2 and CaCO3 and abrupt changes in magnetic susceptibility \n\nvalues (suggesting temporary disturbance of sediment sources) together with increases in calcareous \n\nnannoplankton. On the other hand, in the Tagus prodelta, Abrantes et al. (2005, 2008) sampled the shelf \n\narea just offshore Lisbon. They were able to identify an \u201cinstantaneous deposit\u201d of coarser material \n\n(including broken carbonate shells) on the SSW coring site; and a 1.5m \u201cinstantaneous deposit\u201d of fine \n\nmaterial on the W site in sediment collected in their box-cores. Magnetic susceptibility, grain-size and XRF-\n\nFe data as well as 210Pb and AMS 14C age-estimation were used to characterize the material and time-\n\nconstrain the deposition. By considering the ages of the underlying undisturbed unit, a hiatus was \n\nrecognised at both sites studied, roughly corresponding to 355 years of sedimentation. Both the hiatus and \n\ninstantaneous deposits were considered to be of tsunamigenic origin, the former corresponding to an \n\nerosive episode and the latter to sedimentation, both in association with the backwash of the same tsunami \n\nevent. Also in the south western coast of Portugal, Pereira et al. (2007) identified, in the Malh\u00e3o beach and \n\ndune field (approximately 150 km south of Lisbon), which develop in close association with aeolianite \n\noutcrops, a group of 43 boulders located from 20 up to 135m inland of the present day coastline. The \n\nhighest boulder is located at 19m above msl and the heaviest boulder weights 19t. By means of a \n\nstraightforward application of Nott\u2019s equations and identification of some geomorphological features, the \n\nauthors concluded that the only event capable of transporting and deposited boulders of such dimensions \n\nwas the AD 1755 tsunami. \n\nThe tsunami deposits of AD 1755 that were deposited along the Algarve coastline mostly consist of \n\na laterally extensive layer of shell-rich sand, which ramps and thins landwards, displaying an erosive base \n\nand an irregular, sometime undulating, upper boundary; this boundary may be sharp or made of a subtle \n\ntextural and compositional transition to the overlying sediment. In some locations, the tsunami deposit is \n\nentirely composed of sand. In other areas, the tsunami deposits are characterized by sand sheets containing \n\nisolated cobbles, which preferably concentrate at the base of the tsunami deposit. Andrade (1990, 1992) \n\ndetected tsunami deposits in sections of the barrier-island chain of Ria Formosa, central Algarve. He \n\nconcluded that the AD 1755 earthquake was responsible for severe damage of the barrier chain at Ria \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n44 \n \n\nFormosa, leading to the drawning and amputation of its oriental extremity and to the extensive overwash of \n\ntwo of the eastern barrier islands (Armona and Tavira). Moreover, Andrade (1992) also refers that the \n\nmorphological analysis of the backbarrier surface of these two islands reveals a unique pattern, compatible \n\nwith the exceptional overwash event and with the drainage network reorganization process that must have \n\nfollowed the AD 1755 tsunami. Dawson et al. (1995), Hindson et al. (1996) and Hindson and Andrade (1999) \n\nidentified a tsunami deposit attributed to the AD 1755 tsunami, at Boca do Rio lowland, western Algarve \n\ncoast of Portugal. Detailed historical record of the AD 1755 tsunami flooding described the destruction of a \n\ncontemporaneous coastal dune by the incoming tsunami waves (Silva Lopes, 1841). The tsunamigenic unit, \n\nreferred to by Dawson et al. (1995) as a \u201cchaotic layer\u201d, \u201cconsists of a massive structureless matrix of detrital \n\nsediment ranging from a muddy/sandy conglomerate to coarse muddy sand. According to Hindson and \n\nAndrade (1999) this unit marks a distinct sedimentological and micropalaeontological break from the \n\ndeposits enclosing it. Those authors noted the lowermost section of the deposit appears to have been \n\ndeposited from a highly turbulent water mass, which was able to transport gravel-sized limestone clasts as \n\nwell as gravel sized mud balls eroded from the underlying estuarine soft material (rip-up clasts). The water \n\nmass rapidly lost energy as it progressed inland, leading to the deposition of predominantly shell-rich sand, \n\nsilt and clay particles. Andrade et al. (1997) and Kortekaas and Dawson (2007) also described a tsunami \n\ndeposit in Martinhal, east of Sagres. This massive deposit, which extends across most of the lowland area, \n\nwas suggested to have being laid down by the AD 1755 tsunami (Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007). Besides \n\nthe tsunami deposit, the stratigraphy of Martinhal also displays evidence for the activity of storm waves that \n\nhave breached and overtopped the barrier, flooding the lowland and leaving thin sandy overwash layers, but \n\nof smaller inland extension. Both types of marine-derived flood deposits showed similar grain size \n\ncharacteristics and distinctive contents in benthic Foraminifera, evidenced by the predominantly marine \n\nassemblage of the tsunamigenic unit with the presence of Elphidium macellum, E. crispum, Quinqueloculina \n\nseminulum, Cibicides refulgens, C. lobatulus, Eponides repandus and Ammonia. beccarii var. Batavus, but \n\nalso brackish species such as H. germanica and A. beccarii. The most important differences between storm \n\nand tsunami deposits were the rip-up clasts and boulders that were exclusively found in the tsunami deposit \n\nand the landward extent of the tsunami deposit that everywhere exceeded that of the storm deposits. \n\nSchneider et al. (2009) analysed cores from the Carcavai valley, near Quarteira (east of Salgados, in the \n\ncentral Algarve), and detected that one prominent sand layer interrupts the fine-grained sedimentation. After \n\nradiocarbon age-estimation, the authors suggested that this peculiar unit might have been deposited by the \n\nAD 1755 tsunami, although the sum of evidences forwarded to support this origin is small and questionable. \n\nStill in the vicinity of Quarteira, in Salgados, Costa et al. (2009, 2012a) detected and characterized a tsunami \n\ndeposit within Late Holocene lagoonal sediments of Lagoa dos Salgados, based in the recognition of many \n\nof the stratigraphical, textural and compositional diagnostic criteria used to recognize this type of deposition \n\nelsewhere. Furthermore, results of age constraining using 210Pb, 137Cs and 14C methods yielded results that \n\nwere mutually consistent and coherent with the AD 1755 tsunami. Immediately to the west of Salgados, \n\nAlcantarilha lowland is located. Within this lowland Dinis et al. (2010) observed geomorphological features \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n45 \n \n\nthat provided support for a major overwash deposit that not only eroded the top part of a sector of the \n\nconfining dune ridge but was also responsible for the deposition of a fan-shaped sandy layer, which attaches \n\nto the toe of the leeward slope of the dune and thins and wedges out further inland into the adjacent alluvial \n\nplain sediments. The authors interpreted that the most probable mechanism for these sedimentary \n\nevidences should be a tsunami event and 210Pb and137Cs data once more suggests it may date of AD 1755. \n\nCunha et al. (2010) revisited Boca do Rio and Martinhal AD 1755 tsunami deposits to improve the age \n\nmodel by using OSL age-estimation with a higher number of aliquots. Contrary to previous works, the \n\nauthors obtained a good set of dates for the deposit, although an age overestimation of the tsunami-laid \n\nsands was attributed to the rapid erosion and deposition of older sediments, with insufficient light exposure \n\nfor complete bleaching during the tsunami event itself. Costa et al. (2011) observed in the Barranco and \n\nFurnas alluvial plains a relatively unique size-range of the particles [0.3 - 1m (a-axis diameter)] that were \n\ntransported inland a few hundred meters into the alluvial plain. The radiocarbon dates obtained through the \n\nuse of in situ endolithic shells suggested that transport was contemporary with the AD 1755 tsunami. \n\nFurther east in the Gulf of Cadiz, several tsunamigenic deposits have been recognized both \n\nonshore (e.g. Lario et al., 2011) and offshore (e.g. Gracia et al., 2010). Luque et al. (2001) conducted \n\nstudies of sedimentary deposits of the Valdelagrana spit and barrier complex (Cadiz, Spain). A depositional \n\nevent was detected within the barrier complex and it was suggested that it recorded an event similar to the \n\nAD 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which might have occurred at 216-218 BC. More recent single-event deposits \n\nof the Valdelagrana spit were correlated with the AD 1755 tsunami. The older deposits could be \n\ncontemporaneous and correlated with deposits observed in estuarine lowlands of the Donana National Park, \n\nSW Spain (Ruiz et al., 2005). Ruiz et al. (2005) conducted studies focused in the Mid-Holocene evolution of \n\nsedimentary environments of the Do\u00f1ana National Park. They concluded that in the last 5300\u20133700 cal. \n\nyears BP interval a progressive estuarine infilling conditioned by the growth of channel levees and the \n\nprogradation of the Donana spit towards the east has occurred. This infilling pattern was being periodically \n\ninterrupted by high-energy events causing the breakthrough of the Donana spit and inducing biological crisis \n\nof the estuarine faunas. These crisis induced temporary but strong reduction of the characteristic estuarine \n\nassemblages (detected in ostracods and bivalves), with introduction of reworked marine faunas towards the \n\ninner estuary. Several sedimentary units associated with these barrier breaching episodes and faunal crisis \n\nwere associated with different tsunamigenic events, including the AD 1755 tsunami. Morales et al. (2008) \n\ninvestigated tsunami deposits in the Tinto-Odiel estuary (Huelva). They characterized the outer part of the \n\nestuary by extensive sand-rich sedimentary bodies of marine origin, whereas the central and inner parts \n\nwere filled by muddy, tidally deposited sediment bodies. Recorded within these inner estuarine sediment \n\nbodies five laterally continuous shelly units were detected. According to Morales et al. (2008), each of these \n\nunits displayed many of the typical characteristics of tsunami deposits, comprising an erosional base \n\nfollowed by a fining-upward sand-sized sequence that begins with shell accumulation and ends with \n\nbioturbated muddy sand. The results of 14C ages and indirect age-estimation using accumulation rates \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n46 \n \n\nderived from the study of recent radionuclides suggest that these five tsunami deposits correspond with \n\nknown events that occurred in AD 1755, 1531, 949 (1033?), 881, and 395 (381?), all of which are \n\ndocumented in historical sources (Morales et al.,2008). \n\nStill in the eastern part of the Gulf of Cadiz, the work on boulder deposits of Whelan and Kelletat (2005) \n\ndeserves a special note. In Cape Trafalgar, they detected approximately 280 imbricated megaclasts \n\nweighing between 1 and 10t that were observed resting between high tide level and 5m above in a coastal \n\nstretch of 100m long directly south of that headland. They argued that the larger boulders preserved at Cape \n\nTrafalgar are the only possible proofs for a tsunami event along an approximately 100 km stretch of \n\ncoastline between the mouth of the Guadalquivir and Punta Camarinal, halfway between Barbate and Tarifa. \n\nHowever, Reicherter et al. (2010) identified outcrop evidences for paleo-tsunamis along a 50 km long \n\nsegment of the Atlantic coast of southern Spain. According to these authors several depositional \n\nenvironments in the coast between Barbate and Tarifa yielded preserve tsunamigenic sediment layers \n\namong other evidences of tsunami impacts, both on top of rocky cliffs as well as in lagoons and in \n\nmarshlands. The authors associated deposits identified with the AD 1755 but also attributed multiple \n\nintercalations to older tsunamis. \n\nStorms have been defined for this area as events where the significant height (Hs) of waves is \n\ngreater than 3m (Pessanha and Pires, 1981). In terms of storm deposits only over recent years the \n\nsedimentary effects have been described and/or monitored in greater detail (e.g. Andrade et al., 2004; \n\nKortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Matias et al., 2008; Almeida et al., 2011). Andrade et al. (2004) studied \n\nmarsh detached beaches in Ria Formosa lagoon and were able to detect storm deposits within the \n\nlithostratigraphical framework observed in cores. These (multiple) sand bodies had limited lateral extension \n\nand were separated by muddy lagoonal sediments indicating that distinct episodes of entrainment of marine \n\nsand into the lagoonal space alternated with low-energy sedimentation. In the same region, Matias et al. \n\n(2008) using aerial photographs observed a total of 369 different washovers along the lagoonal boundary of \n\nRia Formosa barriers during the period 1947-2001. The number of washovers remained relatively stable \n\nfrom 1947 to 1972 and increased dramatically between 1972 and 1976 probably as a result of the \n\ndevelopment of immature inlet margins and downdrift starvation. From 1976 to 2001, washover occurrences \n\ndeclined and their spatial dimensions diminished, leading to a decrease in overwash activity over this time. \n\nAccording to these authors, exceptional to infrequent oceanographic conditions are the only formation \n\nmechanism able to generate an overwash in well-developed and stable foredunes. Although inundation of \n\nestablished foredunes was not observed for the studied period, this phenomenon has been described for the \n\neastern section of Anc\u00e3o barrier (Andrade, 1990) as a result of exceptional storm conditions during the 1941 \n\ncyclone. Kortekaas and Dawson (2007) in Martinhal used a combination of grain size and foraminiferal \n\nanalyses to assess differences between tsunami and storm deposits. Only the tsunami deposit contained \n\nlarge boulders, sometimes with borings of molluscs at their surface and intraclasts eroded from the \n\nunderlying surface. Oliveira et al. (2011) used field observations, aerial photography and wave data to \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n47 \n \n\ncharacterize the transport of two megaclasts weighting 14 and 8t and sitting at present above 1.70m above \n\nmsl in the upper shore platform of Praia das Ma\u00e7\u00e3s (west Portuguese coast \u2013 approximately 20 km north of \n\nCascais) and associate them with a specific event (storm in 1973). \n\n \n\n2.5.2. Scotland \n\nBy far the biggest tsunami that has struck the coastline of Scotland was the tsunami associated \n\nwith the giant Storegga submarine landslide located on the continental slope west of Norway that took place \n\nca. 8000 yr BP (Figure 2.4). However, recent studies have shown that the Holocene Storegga Slide is just \n\none of a series of mega-slides (>2000 km2) that have occurred offshore mid-Norway since the end of the \n\nPliocene, with a frequency of roughly 100,000 years over the last 0.5 Ma (Bryn et al., 2002). \n\nDeposits from the Storegga tsunami have been found in NE England (e.g. Horton et al., 1999; \n\nShennan et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2004), N Sotland (Dawson et al., 1996; Dawson and Smith, 2000), NE \n\nScotland (e.g. Dawson et al., 1988; Long et al., 1989; Tooley and Smith, 2005), Shetland Islands (e.g. \n\nBondevik et al., 2003; Bondevik et al., 2005; Dawson et al., 2006), Faroe Islands (e.g. Grauert et al., 2001) \n\nand to north of the Arctic Circle along the coast of Norway (e.g. Bondevik et al., 1997) and Greenland \n\n(Wagner et al., 2007) (Figure 2.4). The tsunami sediments associated with the Storegga slide can be \n\ngenerally described as consisting mainly of fine or fine to medium sand, sometimes with some silt and clay \n\nand very occasionally containing gravel or stones in the basal layers. It often contains fragments or \n\nintraclasts of organic material and sometimes intraclasts of silt while rip-up clasts of peat have also been \n\nidentified. Typically the tsunami units present at least one fining upwards sequence, commonly with bi-modal \n\nsize distribution, and present a maximum thickness of 1.56m but the deposit is normally ca. 10\u201330 cm thick \n\n(Smith et al., 2004). The microfossil content (Diatoms and Foraminifera) of the tsunamigenic layer provides \n\ngrounds to support a high-energy event of marine origin involving sediments of probably local provenance \n\n(Smith et al., 2004). In NE England, near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Horton et al. (1999) and Shennan et al. \n\n(2000) described a sand horizon of marine provenance within a coastal peat moss and attributed it to a high-\n\nenergy flood. The singularity of the layer in the sediment sequence, its stratigraphically unconformable lower \n\ncontact in the transect, implying erosion of underlying sediments; its rapid rise up-valley in the transect to \n\nexceed the height of later marine deposits and its age range, allowed the identification of the sand layer as a \n\nprobable Holocene Storegga Slide tsunami deposit. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n48 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 - White dots show where tsunami deposits associated with theStoregga slide have been mapped. Other slides \nare the Tr\u00e6nadjupet slide dated to ca. 4000 14Cyr BP, slides on the NE Faroe margin and the small Afen slide in the Faroe\u2013\n\nShetland Channel (adapted from Bondevik et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nIn NE Scotland, in Montrose, the first traces of tsunamigenic units were discussed by Dawson et al. \n\n(1988) describing within uplifted coastal sediment sequences an unusual mainly fine or medium sand layer, \n\noccasionally coarser, but with some silt and sometimes containing intraclasts of peat. Other similar deposits \n\nin different locations in NE Scotland have since then been associated with the Storegga slide (e.g. Tooley \n\nand Smith, 2005). In Inverness, excavations revealed a Mesolithic horizon covered by a layer of marine sand \n\nthat was ascribed to the Storegga tsunami (Dawson et al., 1990). In northern Sutherland (North Scotland), \n\nDawson et al. (1996) and Dawson and Smith (2000) described a coarser layer in marked contrast to the \n\nunder and overlying sediments. A pronounced erosional unconformity with the underlying sediments was \n\nobserved. The presence of a mixed diatom assemblage, although fragmentary, indicated a chaotic \n\naccumulation of the deposit with all habitats represented. Variations in particle size within the sequence \n\ndisclosed strong similarities with other tsunami deposits elsewhere in the North Sea basin and previously \n\nassociated with the Storegga slide. \n\nIn Norway, a group of coastal lakes recorded the marine input of water and sediment that the \n\nStoregga tsunami caused in the coastal fringe (Bondevik et al., 1997). The deposits indicate patterns of \n\nchaotic sedimentation with marine sediments resting adjacent to layers of terrestrial peat and twigs. In \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n49 \n \n\nseveral basins tsunami deposition was accompanied by erosion of underlying lake sediments followed by \n\nredeposition within the suite of tsunami sediments. However, the deposits varied greatly in short distances. \n\nBondevik et al. (1997) observed that lake sediment cores of tsunami deposits sampled only 1m apart are \n\nmarkedly different, and attributed this variability to the complicated hydrodynamic behaviour of the tsunami \n\ndue to local variations in lake bathymetry. \n\nIn the Shetland Islands the Storegga tsunamigenic deposit is simply characterized as a sandy layer \n\nin peat (Bondevik et al., 2003). However, more recent work by Bondevik et al. (2005) and Dawson et al. \n\n(2006) also detected two other tsunamigenic units that were attributed to more recent submarine slides. One \n\nof these events, detected in Basta Voe and dated of 1500 years BP was characterized as a fine-medium \n\nsandy unit sandwiched in peat, with frequent bimodal distribution and with clear marine \n\nmicropalaeontological assemblage. In two other lakes deposits from another tsunami dated to ca. 5500 cal \n\nyr BP were also detected. The sediment facies were similar to those of the Storegga tsunami. \n\nIn the Faroe Islands the tsunamigenic unit associated with the Storegga slide was recognized in a \n\ncoastal lake situated 4m above msl on the island of Suouroy (Grauert et al., 2001). The authors identified \n\nwithin the lagoonal stratigraphy a major erosional and redepositional event. The (re)deposited sediment \n\nranges from sand and sandy gyttja with marine shell fragments and foraminifera, to gyttja with rip-up clasts, \n\nwood fragments and thin sand layers. Diatom analysis indicated that the deposit contained 5\u20138% full marine \n\nspecies, decreasing to 1\u20132% in the undisturbed lacustrine gyttja above. The tsunami waves deposited two \n\ngenerations of sand overlain by organic conglomerates, after which followed a unit of suspension material \n\nand normal lacustrine gyttja (Grauert et al., 2001). A 2.73m long sediment sequence from Loon Lake (East \n\nGreenland), located at 18m above msl, was recovered by Wagner et al. (2007). The sequence mainly \n\nconsisted of fine grained homogeneous sediments, which were interrupted by a 0.72m thick sandy horizon \n\nwith erosive basis and distinct fluctuations in the grain-size distribution. According to radiocarbon dates, this \n\nsandy horizon was deposited after 8500\u20138300 cal. yr BP and was interpreted as originated from the \n\nStoregga tsunami. \n\nDue to its geographical location the coast of Scotland is occasionally subjected to extreme storm \n\nevents that can cause major erosion and, in some cases, transport and deposition of coarser material. One \n\nexample of this was the Great Storm of 11th January of 2005 that caused extensive damage across the \n\nScottish Outer Hebrides with severe impacts having occurred across South Uist and Benbecula (Dawson et \n\nal., 2007). The hurricane-force winds together with an intense storm surge resulted in significant change in \n\ncoastal landscape along the entire western seabord and, in particular, on headlands (Angus and Rennie, \n\n2007). In general, severe erosion was focused along coastal areas located west of the roads that link North \n\nUist and Benbecula, Benbecula and South Uist and South Uist and Eriskay. According to Dawson et al. \n\n(2007) the coastal response to the storm was complex. In some areas, coastal dunes were subject to \n\nsignificant retreat. In other areas deposition of shingle and even boulders was observed. Sand drift and its \n\nassociation with storms (storminess) have also been identified in the Outer Hebrides. (Dawson et al., 2004) \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n50 \n \n\ndemonstrated a concentration of aeolian activity between AD 1500 and 1700. Inland-tapering sand units \n\nwere detected within marshland areas. The inland extent of each sand unit was radiocarbon dated and the \n\nunits were collectively interpreted as a proxy for past coastal storminess. The data appeared to indicate that \n\nfor the study sites investigated, the majority of the sand units were produced during episodes of climate \n\ndeterioration, both prior to and after the well-known period of Medieval warmth (Dawson et al., 2004). In the \n\nShetland Islands and in Scotland boulders transported by major storms have been described and this matter \n\nhas been intensely debated (e.g. Williams and Hall, 2004; Hall et al., 2006; Hansom et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n2.5.3. Indonesia \n\nAlthough tsunami sedimentation has been studied abundantly in the Indonesian archipelago, \n\nincluding the events of 1883 - Krakatoa (van der Bergh et al., 2003), 1992 -  Flores (Minoura et al., 1997; Shi \n\net al., 1995; Dawon et al., 1996), 1994 - Java (Dawson et al., 1996) and 1998 - Papua New Guinea \n\n(Gelfenbaum and Jaffe, 2003), after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami an astonishing number of papers \n\nfocusing in the sedimentary evidences and consequences of this event in Indonesia were published. The \n\nisland of Sumatra was strongly affected by this event and several sedimentological studies were conducted \n\n(e.g. Moore et al., 2006; Paris et al., 2007; Meilianda et al., 2007; Monecke et al., 2008; Paris et al., 2009; \n\nParis et al., 2010a; Paris et al., 2010b; Wassmer et al., 2010, Spiske et al., 2010). Immediately after the \n\nIndian Ocean tsunami of 2004 an International Tsunami Survey team was assembled and conducted \n\nsedimentary research in several locations in Sumatra (Figure 2.5). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Areas studied by the International Tsunami Survey Team after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami (1- Krueng Sabe, \n2- Leupeung, 3- Lhok Nga, 4- Lampuuk, 5- Banda Aceh, 6- Sigli). \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n51 \n \n\nA progression from intense near coast erosion, deposition of sediment inland, to deposition of \n\nsediment and debris near the landward edge of inundation was observed in the area located south of Lhok \n\nNga and north of Leupung (Moore et al., 2006). Along the coastline the tsunami removed the ca. 10m wide \n\nbeach and also removed all soil present within at least 20m of the shoreline, exposing the roots of trees that \n\nwithstood the flow and scouring into underlying beach rock (Moore et al., 2006). About 50 to 200m from the \n\nbeach, sand was deposited in a continuous layer about 10cm thick. From about 200m from shore inland to \n\nthe edge of inundation (up to about 450m from shore), debris such as tree trunks and the contents of houses \n\nwere observed as an increasingly large part of the deposit (Moore et al., 2006). The tsunami deposit in this \n\narea was characterized as a pinkish grey, poorly sorted coarse to very coarse sand, becoming medium sand \n\nlandward (Moore et al., 2006). The tsunami unit showed evidence of having multiple sources, including a \n\nsource near the present shoreface, a subtidal source, and possibly an inland source (Moore et al., 2006). \n\nIn nearby Lhok Nga the geomorphologic impact of the tsunami was evidenced by severe coastal \n\nerosion (Paris et al., 2009). The upper limit of destruction appeared as a continuous trimline at 20-30m \n\nabove mean sea level and run-up exceeded 50m at the southern point of the bay (Labuhan Point: Paris et \n\nal., 2007). The erosional imprints of the tsunami extend to 500m inland and exceeded 2 km landward along \n\nthe river beds (Paris et al., 2007, 2010b). Paris et al. (2007) described the tsunami deposits in Lhok Nga as \n\ncoarse to medium greyish to yellowish sands, showing important variations in thickness, grain-size and \n\nvertical trends. The deposits overlaid brown sandy soils, dune sands or beach-rock near the coast, reddish \n\nsands in the rivers, and a dark brown silty soil in the rice paddies. \n\nAccording to Paris et al. (2007) the contact between the tsunami deposits and the buried soil was \n\nabrupt or erosional when developed over soft material such as sand. The thickness of the tsunami deposits \n\nvaried and reached maxima in the topographic lows: 44cm in a small bay near Labuhan, 52cm in a lagoon \n\nbetween Lampuuk and Lhok Nga, 70cm between the razed dunes of Lampuuk, and 82cm flanked on a sand \n\ncliff near the cement factory. Paris et al. (2007) concluded that 75% of the 26 cross-sections displayed \n\nstratification into distinct layers, the number of which ranged between 7 and 15. The lower part of the \n\nsequence was usually coarse and massive whereas the upper part was usually finer and sometimes \n\nlaminated by multiple pulses of deposition. Discontinuous thin mud lines were often observed in cross \n\nsection intercalated between the main layers (Paris et al., 2007). The same authors observed that the quartz \n\ngrains were mostly sub-angular to sub-rounded, like those sampled from the present-day beach. The \n\nmicrofaunas identified were typical of a shallow marine environment (Paris et al., 2007). The grain-size \n\ndistribution observed along Lampuuk was characterised by two successive sequences of landward fining \n\nlayers. In Lhok Nga, it was also observed that the abundance of nannoliths in the 2004 tsunami deposits \n\ndecreased landward and upward, despite variations due to successive erosion/sedimentation phases by \n\nsuccessive waves and to topographical effects (Paris et al., 2010a). \n\nIn the same location, boulder transport and deposition was also observed during the 2004 Indian \n\nOcean tsunami. The tsunamigenic waves were able to detach and transport coral boulders in excess of 10t \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n52 \n \n\nover 500\u2013700m and megaclasts of the platform in excess of 85t over a few metres although no landward \n\ndecrease in size was observed (Paris et al., 2009). The authors concluded that the spatial and size \n\ndistributions of tsunami boulder deposits mostly depend on the location and characteristics of their source \n\n(coral reef, beach rock, platform, dams), together with clast-clast and clast-surface interference during \n\ntransport (Paris et al., 2009). An estimation of the volume of sediments deposited in Lhok Nga by the 2004 \n\nIndian Ocean tsunami suggested that more than 75% of the tsunami deposits came from nearshore (Paris et \n\nal., 2009), which is in contrast with the established predominant source of the sandy deposits at the same \n\nlocation (Paris et al., 2007). The coincidence of different size modes, from boulders to fine sands suggests \n\nthat the whole of the material was not transported in suspension, but rather through a combination of rolling, \n\nsaltation and suspension. In Banda Aceh coastal marshes, the record of tsunamigenic deposits was \n\nextended backward in time due to the recognition of two sand layers deposited after AD 1290-1400 and AD \n\n780-990 (Monecke et al., 2008). \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n53 \n \n\n \n\n3. Study areas \n\n3.1. Algarve \n\n3.1.1.  Geographical and Geological setting \n\nTsunami events in the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula are a consequence of the \n\ncompressive tectonic environment of the Ibero-Maghrebian area (e.g. Baptista et al., 1998; Zitellini et al., \n\n2001; Gutscher et al., 2006), the transcurrent motion along the Gloria Fault and surrounding area \n\n(Kaabouben et al., 2008) or the effect of other distant seismic sources (i.e. Azores or Grand Banks) (Baptista \n\nand Miranda, 2009) (Figure 3.1). The oldest tsunami event often considered in Portuguese earthquake \n\ncatalogues is dated from 60 BC (Baptista and Miranda, 2009). In fact, the Iberian Peninsula has low \n\nfrequency of tsunamis although the largest tsunami that affected the Atlantic coasts of Europe in historical \n\ntimes was the well-known AD 1755 tsunami, which followed the Lisbon earthquake. In many coastal regions \n\nof Portugal and SW Spain, the destructive effects of the AD 1755 tsunami were more disastrous than the \n\ndirect effects of the earthquake. The first three waves of the tsunami were particularly destructive along the \n\nwest and south coasts of Portugal (Oliveira, 2005). After the earthquake the tsunami quickly affected the \n\ncoasts of Iberia and Morrocco, reaching Cape Saint Vincent in 15 minutes, Lisbon in 30 minutes, Cadiz in 78 \n\nminutes, Huelva in 50 minutes, Oporto in one hour, Madeira in 90 minutes and Safi in 30 minutes, (Baptista \n\net al., 1998). The effects of the tsunami were felt over the Atlantic. Detailed historical records of the AD 1755 \n\nevents have been previously summarized by several authors (e.g. Silva Lopes, 1841; Pereira de Sousa, \n\n1919; Oliveira, 2005; Oliveira, 2008). The driving mechanisms, sources (and thus return period) of large \n\nmagnitude earthquakes and tsunami generated in the Iberian region have been extensive challenged in \n\nrecent years, following the conclusion that the events of AD 1755 and AD 1969 have been sourced in \n\ndifferent areas of the SW Iberian margin. However, the major tsunamigenic threat for the Atlantic coast of \n\nIberia is the earthquake activity associated with the Azores-Gibraltar plate boundary and neotectonic and \n\ngravity-induced sea-floor activity offshore the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n54 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Main geomorphologic features and detailed tectonic characterization of the Gulf of Cadiz (adapted from Duarte \net al., 2010).

A) Location of the offshore SW Iberian Margin (3D digital \nbathymetry model from MATESPRO dataset); (B) general drainage system of the local continental shelf and slope. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n55 \n \n\nThe Algarve coast presents a geological and morphological asymmetry, mainly due to the \n\noccurrence of different wave regimes and to the nature and structural features of the outcropping lithologies. \n\nThe coastline can be divided into two different areas (i.e. west coast and the south facing coast), due to the \n\ngeomorphological contrast, the south coast can be further subdivided into windward and leeward coastal \n\nsectors. In this study only the windward sector will be addressed. \n\nThe windward coast has developed in resistant Mesozoic limestone, dolomite and marl and softer Miocenic \n\nlimestone, detrital limestone and siltstone. Both resistant and softer lithologies form cliffs with steep slopes \n\n(Figure 3.2). Cliffs with Jurassic substrate sometimes plunge directly to the ocean whereas Tertiary rocks \n\nusually present cliffs with its toe exhibiting narrow beaches or platforms, both intertidal and subtidal. The \n\nwindward coast of Algarve is limited to the west by the Cape S. Vicente and to the east by the Anc\u00e3o beach \n\n(Figure 3.2). The existent morphology in the western part of the windward sector is a consequence of the \n\ntectonics, represented by numerous faults with a NNE-SSW main direction, and by alongshore succession \n\nof different lithologies, with different resistances to erosion, forming an irregular coastline with numerous \n\nheadlands and narrow embayments. In this sector, the coastline is characterized by rocky cliffs, with heights \n\nvarying between 40m and 110m above msl, interrupted by small beaches. The eastern sector of this \n\nwindward coast presents a coastline with well-developed estuaries and bays separated by cliffs with heights \n\nvarying between 20m and 50m above msl. The rivers and streams that flow in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic \n\nrocks display poorly developed catchment areas inland and alluvial plains, which are essentially composed \n\nof mud that resulted from the weathering and erosion of limestones and Flysch outcropping in the \n\nwatershed. In the eastern sector of the windward coast the prevailing lithologies (i.e marls and clastic \n\ncarbonate Miocene rocks) contribute to the cliffy appearance of the coastline. According to Andrade (1990), \n\nthe cliffs fringe forms a marine-cut costal platform essentially affecting Miocene carbonated rock. This \n\nsurface is at an average height of 45m though gently sloping to SE, and is heavily karstified. The sector \n\nlocated to the east of Olhos de \u00c1gua and west of the Anc\u00e3o beach is characterized by a narrow beach \n\nbacked by a linear cliff cut in Pliocene-Pleistocene soft sand and gravel. The cliffs frequently collapse, and \n\nshow the highest erosion and retreat rates found in the Algarve (Andrade, 1990). The drainage system \n\nexisting in this section of the coastline, presents mainly small streams that extend to a maximum of 4 km \n\ninland, draining the Pliocene-Pleistocene bedrock, with the exception of Quarteira and Carcavai streams \n\n(Figure 3.2), which extend further inland, presenting well developed catchment areas and draining the entire \n\nMesozoic and Cenozoic sequence. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n56 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Geological map of the Algarve.

Oceanography \n\n In order to recognize extreme marine inundations it is important to assess the wave regime, \n\noceanographic conditions, tide levels and other predominant oceanographic factors. \n\nIn 1979, the Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico was able to characterize the wave regime in the Portuguese \n\ncoasts based in non-directional data gathered in several measuring stations. At a later stage the deployment \n\nof offshore buoys in Faro, Sines, Figueira da Foz and Leix\u00f5es allowed the collection of wave data with a 10 \n\nminute frequency. Costa et al. (2001) based in the data collected by the above mentioned buoys was able to \n\ncharacterize the mean wave conditions for Figueira da Foz, Sines and Faro. They were able to conclude that \n\nthe annual average period was 5-7s (Figueira da Foz \u2013 6.6s; Sines - 7.2s; Faro -4.7s). The most common \n\npeak values were observed between 9-13s (Figueira da Foz - 11.4s; Sines \u2013 10.8s; Faro \u2013 8.2s). In the \n\nsouth coast of Portugal 52% of the observations correspond to a W direction, with a slight increase in the \n\nwinter (Costa et al., 2001). During the summer the wave direction tend to rotate to the north while the SW \n\nand WSW directions occur more typical during the winter. \n\nThe wave regime is of low energy, with mean annual significant wave height (Hs) &lt;1m and storms \n\nare essentially related with westerlies and west-northwest deep water waves approaching from the Atlantic. \n\nThe storm wave regime is discussed in a report by LNEC (1987), using a combination of buoy and \n\nhindcasted data (Table 3.1). \n\nThe maximum astronomical high tide levels, in the Algarve, are about 1.80m above mean sea level \n\nand during extreme spring tides the high tide level may slightly exceed 2m above msl (Hindson and \n\nAndrade, 1999). The tidal range is approximately 2.1m and ca. 3m during spring tides, and the maximum \n\nreported elevations reached by sea-level in spring high tide during intense storms reflect just a small \n\ncontribution of storm surge to the observed extreme levels: about 2.15m above msl (cf. Esaguy, 1984) \n\nFurthermore, Taborda and Dias (1992), based in the study of 2 major storms (14th of February to 3rd March \n\nof 1978; 25th to 31st of December 1981) indicated that the storm surge caused a maximum elevation of the \n\nsea of 0.42m in Lagos. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n58 \n \n\nTable 3.1 - Storm occurrences offshore the Algarve coast between 1955 and 1986 (LNEC, 1987). \n\nDate Hs (m) Direction \n\n10 to 15 Feb 1955 5.6 W \n\n15 to 20 Dec 1958 7.9 WNW \n\n1 to 9 Dec 1959 5.6 WNW \n\n16 to 22 Feb 1966 9.2 W \n\n10 to 15 Jan 1969 4.8 WNW \n\n19 to 27 Jan 1971 3.8 NW \n\n13 to 18 Jan 1972 5.5 NW \n\n31 Jan to 5 Feb 1972 4.5 WSW \n\n23 to 28 Dec 1972 4.9 WNW \n\n13 to 18 Jan 1973 9.5 W \n\n26 to 30 Oct 1976 4.3 WNW \n\n30 Nov to 4 Dec 1976 3.6 WNW \n\n14 Dec 1976 3.0 --- \n\n31 Dec 1976 to 1 Jan 1977 2.5-3.0 --- \n\n22 Feb to 1 Mar 1977 5.6 W \n\n6 to 14 Dec 1978 6.1 W \n\n27 to 28 Dec 1978 3.5-4.5 --- \n\n27 to 28 Jan 1979 3.0-4.0 --- \n\n8 to 15 Feb 1979 7.0 NW \n\n25 to 31 Dec 1981 7.9 SW \n\n \n\nPessanha and Pires (1981) calculated the probability and return period of waves offshore the Algarve (Table \n\n3.2) and established a centennial storm with Hs of 6.5m and a decennial storm with Hs of 5.2m. \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 - Return period offshore the south facing coast of the Algarve (Pessanha and Pires, 1981). \n\nHs (m) Return period (years) \n\n4.8 5 \n\n5.2 10 \n\n5.7 25 \n\n6.1 50 \n\n6.5 100 \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n59 \n \n\nCosta et al.

Salgados \n\nThe Salgados lowland is located in the bay between Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara and Gal\u00e9 (Figure 3.2 and \n\n3.3). This coast features a 6 km-long intermediate-reflective sand beach backed by a continuous, 3 to 17m-\n\nhigh vegetated foredune (Figure 3.4), the latter covering resistant Pleistocene-Holocene aeolianite and \n\nbeachrock (Moura et al., 2007). The continuity of the beach-dune system is interrupted by the ephemeral \n\ninlets of two infilled lagoons, which developed in relation with the outlet of intermitent streams: the \n\nAlcantarilha lagoon and stream, and the Salgados lagoon and Espiche stream, which drain, respectively, \n\n204 and 41km2 watersheds, mostly developed in Early Miocene limestone and Late Miocene siltstone and \n\nsandstone (Pinto and Teixeira, 2002) (Figure 3.2 and 3.5). The Salgados Lagoon extended across some \n\n1.5km2 but about half of this surface has been reclaimed and landfilled for a golf course. The remnant \n\nsurface is a flat-floored depression 1.1 to 1.7m above mean sea level, collecting water and muddy sediment \n\nfrom the adjacent catchment and is usually flooded by about 1m of water. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n60 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Geographical location of Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 - Oblique aerial view of Salgados lowland in March 2011 (provided by SB Teixeira - ARH-Algarve). \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n61 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 Drainage basin of Ribeira de Espiche/Lagoa dos Salgados.

Boca do Rio \n\nBoca do Rio is located between S. Vicente Cape and Lagos (Figure 3.2 and 3.6). It is a small flat-\n\nfloored and sediment filled lowland located within the otherwise high-cliff coastline of the western Algarve \n\n(Figure 3.7). The lowland area consists of a supratidal floodplain that is periodically subject to extensive river \n\nflooding by the Budens, Vale de Boi and Vale de Bar\u00e3o streams. These rivulets present a seasonal regime \n\nwith strong variations in the flow rate between rainy winters and dryer summers. The Cretaceous limestone \n\nand marly limestone E-W orientated cliffs that limit the Boca do Rio beach to the east and to the west reach \n\nheights of ca. 70m above msl. The flat N-S orientated alluvial plain presents an average height of 1.7m \n\nabove msl and reaching 3m above msl to the north of the plain. The area is separated from the sea by a \n\nstorm gravel and sand ridge and by a rock spur that together forms a barrier to wave overtopping during \n\nstorms (Hindson et al., 1996). A high dune at ca. 8-10m above msl existed in Boca do Rio at the time of the \n\nAD 1755 tsunami (Pereira de Sousa, 1919) but the natural system failed to rebuild a robust dune or beach \n\nsince then (Oliveira et al., 2009). The beach is 200m long and 115m wide and the beach berm rests at 2.1m \n\nabove msl. The drainage basin develops along ca. 80 km2 in Palaeozoic schist and greywacke, claystone, \n\nTriassic siltstone and sandstone, Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous limestone and marls and Plio-Pleistocene \n\nsand and sandstone (Figure 3.8). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Geographical location of Boca do Rio. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n63 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013 View to the Boca do Rio alluvial plain and beach (photo facing the east \u2013 C.

Geographical and Geological setting \n\nTogether Shetland and Orkney form the Scottish Northern Isles and are located in the North \n\nAtlantic, NE of Scotland Mainland. The main tsunamigenic risk in the northeast Atlantic is from submarine \n\nslides, which are more difficult to detect than earthquakes. There is no historical evidence for earthquakes \n\nlarger than 5.4 ML (local magnitude) onshore. However, offshore seismicity, especially in the North Sea, is \n\nprone to larger events. \n\nThe geology of Shetland is varied and rather complex, principally as a result of a large number of \n\nmajor north-south running faults, including the northward continuation of the Great Glen Fault (Figure 3.9). \n\nShetland now forms an important link between the East Greenland, Scottish and Norwegian parts of the \n\nCaledonian Orogenic belt (Johnson et al., 1993). Like much of Scotland, the cover rocks of Shetland are \n\nsupported by platform of Late Archean (2500-3000 Ma) Lewisian basement gneiss which is the northward \n\nextension of the Hebridean Craton. Historically, the Shetland metamorphic cover is called the East Mainland \n\nSuccession with the Yell Sound Division (Moine) at its base, overlain by the Scatsta, Whiteness and Clift \n\nHills Divisions (Dalradian) (Johnson et al., 1993). The Devonian sandstones of Orkney and Shetland were \n\ndeposited in the Orcadian Basin, a low-lying area into which rivers from the Highlands to the west and south \n\ndrained. During the last Ice Age an ice-cap covered Shetland but it was much thinner than that of the \n\nScottish mainland. Evidence for the ice does exist in the form of glacial erratics and moraines. The last ice \n\nsheet left Shetland around 14,000 years ago, though a cold snap a few thousand years later brought about a \n\nreturn of glaciers, the last finally disappearing ca. 10,000 years ago. The outline of Shetland at the end of the \n\nIce Age was very different from today, sea levels being around 100m lower due to the amount of water \n\nlocked up in the ice (Johnson et al., 1993). However, since then, melting ice has caused sea levels to rise \n\nand the Shetland landmass has also been depressed as the massive weight of the ice over the continental \n\nlandmass to the east was removed. Sea levels have therefore risen gradually over the past 14,000 years \n\nand by the time the first Mesolithic gatherers arrived 6,000 or 7,000 years ago it was around 9 metres below \n\ncurrent levels \u2013 peat has been found at this level at this period on the Unst coast (Johnson et al., 1993). The \n\nrecent submergence of Shetland is apparent in the fine detail of its coastline. Peat formerly developed on \n\nboggy surfaces above sea level is now often found at or below sea level and sometimes buried beneath \n\nboulder and gravel beaches. The coastal edges of Shetland few sandy coastlines frequently take the form of \n\na small, sandy cliff, suggesting progressive erosion.  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n66 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 - Geological map of the Shetland Islands (Geological Sketch map of Shetland, 2012, adapted from landforms.eu). \n\n \n\nIn the words of Flinn (1977), \"Shetland is a partly drowned range of hills rising rather sharply from a \n\ndepth of about 82m below present sea level\". The submergence of the archipelago has had a profound \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n67 \n \n\neffect on coastal processes, allowing deep water waves to approach parts of the outer coastline directly and \n\nwithout breaking and the progressive reworking of depositional features on the middle and inner coasts. The \n\nouter coast displays spectacular cliff scenery, reflecting rapid erosion along one of the highest energy \n\ncoastlines in the world. The middle coast is much more sheltered and includes the anchorages of Sullom \n\nVoe and Bressay Sound, where deep water fills drowned glacial valleys. The sands and gravels along the \n\ninner coast are highly mobile, with beaches, spits and bars adapting to sea level rise and being reworked \n\nduring major storms. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.  Oceanography \n\nShetland is one of the stormiest places in Europe. Due to its geographical location the Shetland \n\nislands are very exposed to westerly gales from the North Atlantic.The atmospheric turbulence associated \n\nwith the development of mid-latitude cyclones arises principally from the interaction of cold polar air with \n\nwarmer air from lower latitudes. The collision of air masses of contrasting temperature and density results in \n\nthe development of frontal weather with the air mass boundaries represented respectively by warm, cold and \n\noccluded fronts. These atmospheric processes place Shetland within the North Atlantic storm track (Dawson \n\net al., 2011). During winter, this results in the passage of numerous frontal cyclones, the occurrence of high \n\nwinds and associated spells of high rainfall. During other periods, the Atlantic storm track is displaced either \n\nto the north, or more commonly to the south, of the northeast North Atlantic (Dawson et al., 2011). Such \n\nchanges are normally associated with a change in the position of the jet stream in the upper atmosphere. \n\nWhen this type of circulation occurs (e.g. winter of 2009?10), the prevailing SW airstream can be replaced \n\nby a northerly and NE airflow (Dawson et al., 2011). When the type of synoptic climate occurs, Shetland \n\ntends to experience long periods of extremely cold weather. During the summer months, the vigour of \n\natmospheric circulation is reduced. Storms are less frequent and are commonly replaced by anticyclonic \n\ncirculation that is associated with spells of fine weather. Cyclones also develop during summer but, when \n\nthey occur, are typically less intense and associated with much lower wind velocities than during winter \n\n(Dawson et al., 2011). \n\nInformation on wave data is limited for Shetland waters. Data is available for the wave buoys \n\noperated by the UK Met Office (Station 64045-K5 Buoy and station 64046- K7 wave buoy) and from a tide \n\ngauge in the Shetland capital (Lerwick). The tidal range in Shetland is moderate. There is a tide gauge in \n\nLerwick Harbour, operated by Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory. Maxima data from Jan 1959 to Oct \n\n2000 shows that the highest recorded level in this series is 1.774m (above local ordnance datum from \n\nLerwick) in January 1993 (Crichton, 2003). Average wave heights are around 3m. By 2080, the average \n\ncould be around 4m, and maximum offshore wave heights could be as high as ten metres (Dawson et al., \n\n2001). Storm surges around mainland Scotland have been predicted to become around 3 to 4m by 2080, \n\nand similar levels can perhaps be assumed in Shetland (Crichton, 2003). In the period of 1997-2009 the \n\nmeasured Hs varied between 2.4 to 2.6m the maximum values obtained where ca. 10m (Dawson et al., \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n68 \n \n\n2011). The wave period for the same time interval varied between 8 and 12s (in Lerwick). For Lerwick the \n\nstrongest winds are associated with southerly, south-westerly and westerly directions bringing wet air in from \n\nthe Atlantic. The monthly averaged wind speed data for Lerwick shows temporal seasonal variability in wind \n\nspeed, with a five year running mean suggesting a slight increase in wind speeds from 1972 \u2013 2009. The \n\nannual average wind speeds (in Lerwick 15 knots/s) showed this trend more clearly Dawson et al. (2011). \n\nThis is particularly evident in Lerwick for the years of 1957 \u2013 1980. The lowest pressure recorded in Lerwick \n\nwas 944.4 mb on the 25th December 1999 and the highest 1094 mb on the 7th of December 1997 (Dawson \n\net al., 2011). Lerwick gale day frequencies increased during the period of 1957-2009 (less than 20 days in \n\n1987 to almost 80 days in 2007) (Dawson et al., 2011). \n\nMassive winter storms crash onto Shetland rocky coastline. The sea is an enormously powerful \n\nagent of change, especially when whipped up by the North Atlantic gales that can sweep Shetland, with \n\ngusts of over 277 km/h being recorded at Muckle Flugga lighthouse on 1st January 1992. In 1967 a wind of \n\n283 km/h was recorded at the radar dome on top of Saxa Vord. Enormous waves crash into the shores, \n\neroding coastal outcrops of rock and creating the massive cliffs, with their caves, rock arches and inlets that \n\nare so much a feature of the Shetland coast. Fast-moving and rapidly-developing depressions in the \n\nnortheast Atlantic generate exceptional wind speeds and a high-energy wave regime. Modelling of extreme \n\nwaves in deep water at Schiehallion, 160 km west of Shetland and data from a wave buoy nearby suggest \n\nthat wave heights of 20m occur about 100 times per year (BP Exploration, 1995). Mathematical and physical \n\nmodelling in a wave tank indicated that 20m high deepwater waves will generate breaking waves of a height \n\nroughly equivalent to the deepwater wave height on the cliff faces at The Grind (Hansom et al., 2008), \n\nimplying that the entire cliff top at 15\u201322m may be inundated during storms. \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Voe of Scatsta \n\nA small inlet within Sullom Voe on the north coast of the Shetland Mainland, the Voe of Scatsta lies \n\nbetween Scatsta Ness and Sella Ness (Figure 3.10 and 3.11). Sullom Voe lies on the southern shore of Yell \n\nSound in Mainland Shetland. The site encompasses Gluss Voe, Sullom Voe, Orka Voe and several small \n\nsubsidiary arms and embayments including Voxter, Scatsta and Garths Voes and the Bight of Haggrister \n\n(Figure 3.10). A semi-enclosed body of water at the head of the Voe of Scatsta, within Sullom Voe on the N \n\ncoast of the Shetland Mainland, the Houb of Scatsta lies immediately to the northeast of Scatsta Airport \n\n(Figure 3.11). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n69 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 \u2013 Geographical location of Voe of Scatsta. \n\n \n\nThe shores at the entrances to Sullom Voe are moderately exposed to wave action whereas \n\nextremely sheltered conditions prevail towards the head of Sullom Voe and within the houbs. The shores of \n\nSullom Voe, especially in the more exposed outer regions, are predominantly of bedrock and with varying \n\nslope. Inner, more sheltered, rocky shores generally vary from gently sloping bedrock to boulder and mixed \n\ncobble/sediment but there are also regions of steep cliff and boulder covered shores especially at the head \n\nof Sullom Voe. Significant areas of intertidal sediments only occur at the heads of Gluss, Garths, Scatsta \n\nand Voxter Voes, and around the spit and inside the Houbs of Fugla Ness and Scatsta (Figure 3.10). \n\nSmaller patches of intertidal sediments (coarse sands/gravel) occur sporadically around the region. The \n\nmiddle region of Sullom Voe is more sheltered and is a more varied coastline, indented in places by small \n\nvoes and houbs/lagoons. Intertidal sediments are confined to the houbs and the heads of Gluss, Garths, \n\nScatsta and Voxter Voes. These sediments are variable and poorly sorted, consisting mainly of coarse sand, \n\ngravel, shell debris and peat fragments. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n70 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 \u2013 View of Voe of Scatsta (photo P.

Geographical and Geological setting \n\nThe Outer Hebrides is a chain of islands, 210 km long, in the northwest of mainland Scotland. Sixty \n\nfive islands compose the archipelago, with a combined coastline of 2500 km. The topography of the islands \n\nis characterized by low lying lands on the west coast and the Highlands with mountains, cliffs, fjords and \n\nskerries (rising to heights locally in excess of 200m). Here, the coast is fringed by a largely stabilised dune \n\nsystem consisting of a single low ridge seaward and a gently sloping surface andward, where the system \n\nends amidst peat areas, rocky outcrops and many small lochs (Dawson et al., 2004). The sand areas are \n\nknown locally as machair, derived from the Gaelic word for extensive beach or plain and which describes a \n\nlow-lying, grass-dominated coastal plain composed of calcareous sand with calcium carbonate content up to \n\nca. 80% (Ritchie and Whittington, 1994). Machair is present in the Hebrides extending much of the whole \n\nlength of the islands of Berneray, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist and Barra and up to 2 km inland. Many \n\nof the machair systems in the Outer Hebrides are protected by a dune ridge, although there are sections of \n\ncoastline where, due to erosion, this has been lost (Dawson et al., 2004). It is generally considered to have \n\nformed as a result of aeolian processes and has distinctive dune morphology (e.g. Ritchie, 1979). \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n71 \n \n\nNotwithstanding the apparent uniformity of the machair surface, exposures in the dune face to seaward \n\ndisclose soil and peat horizons which reflect episodes of stability and imply a complex evolution. \n\nMost of the Outer Hebrides is comprised of Lewisian gneiss (Figure 3.12), that forms an upstanding \n\nbasement high that has a discrete faulted eastern margin against Mesozoic and earlier Torridonian \n\nsedimentary basins in the Minches (Fettes et al., 1992). On their western side lies an extensive shallow \n\nshelf, termed the Outer Hebrides Platform with Lewisian gneiss at or near the bedrock surface. It extends \n\nwest of the Uists for some 60 to 70 km. The geology of the Outer Hebrides is dominated by Archaean and \n\nProterozoic Lewisian gneisses, analogous in age with rocks forming the Caledonian foreland of mainland \n\nScotland, but separated from them by sediment filled Mesozoic half-graben beneath the Minch (Fettes et al., \n\n1992). Part of this is exposed as the Stornoway beds (near the town of Stornoway in Lewis), the only non- \n\nLewisian rocks in the Hebrides (Fettes et al., 1992). Classically two major periods of tectonic and \n\nmetamorphic activity has been recognized - Scourian and Laxfordian. The main elements of the gneiss \n\ncomplex were formed during the Scourian. Originally granodioritic, tonalitic and basaltic intrusions emplaced \n\nat mid or lower crustal levels were subjected to deformation and metamorphism (gneiss formation) between \n\n3100 Ma and 2500 Ma. Granite bodies and microdiorite sheets were intruded near the end of the Archaean \n\nin what is termed the late Scourian at around 2600 Ma (Fettes et al., 1992). There followed the widespread \n\nintrusion of the \u2018Younger Basic\u2019 suite of dolerite and basalt dykes and lenticular sheets in the \n\nPalaeoproterozoic at around 2400 Ma. Significant later accretion of possibly arc-related metasedimentary \n\nand metavolcanic rocks and intrusion of the South Harris Igneous Complex occurred at around 1880 Ma. \n\nThe gneisses and earlier igneous bodies were reworked significantly between 1850 Ma and 1600 Ma, during \n\nthe Laxfordian event, and it is the resultant Laxfordian folds, fabrics and metamorphic mineralogy that \n\ndominate the Lewisian rocks of the Outer Hebrides (Fettes et al., 1992). \n\nThe most obvious major structure of the Outer Isles is the Outer Hebrides Fault Zone, a gently \n\nESE-dipping, structure with evidence of polyphase compressional, strike slip and extensional displacement, \n\na major eastward dipping thrust zone, marked by pseudotachylite, cataclasite and brecciated 'mashed \n\ngneiss' (Fettes et al., 1992). The extensive machair, sand dunes, sandy beaches and inter-tidal sand flats, \n\nare a particularly outstanding feature of the coastal geomorphology of the area. At the end of the last \n\nglaciation (Late Devensian) the pre-machair surface was covered by glacially scoured substrate with \n\nmarshes and lochs occupying the depressions. With the subsequent rise in sea level during Holocene \n\nglacially derived sands from offshore were mobilised and mixed with shell debris. This material was \n\nreworked into coastal ridges and moved onshore overriding pre-existing lacustrine and organic deposits \n\n(Ritchie, 1985). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n72 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 - Geological map of the Hebridean Terrane, NW Scotland (adapted from maps in Geology of Scotland, 2003). \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Oceanography \n\nThe wave climate of the Outer Hebrides is severely depth limited. The offshore platform to the west \n\nof the Outer Hebrides is a relic of the old coastal plains which have been flooded since Neolithic times \n\n(4000-2000 BC). This eroded land provides a gently sloping platform far out to sea which forces incoming \n\nwaves to shoal and lose energy before breaking on the coastline. During a storm or particularly high tide \n\nevent wave heights may increase to be greater than normally anticipated owing to the increased depth of \n\nnearshore water (and consequently the decreased shoaling effect) (Richard and Phipps, 2007). \n\nFortnum (1981) compiled wave data from March 1976 to February 1978 at 57\u00ba18\u2019 N, 7\u00ba38\u2019 W at \n\napproximately 15 km west of the island of South Uist, where the water depth is about 42m. Predominant \n\nmeasured wind directions were westerly, north and south-westerly winds, while Hs varied from 1.5 to 2m \n\n(corresponding to 17.7% of the total). Wave periods lay between 2.5 and 12.5s, while the most frequently \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n73 \n \n\noccurring values were 6.0-6.5s (corresponding to 14.1% of the total). The wave power measured during the \n\ntwo year period of observation was of approximately 585 kWh/m. \n\nThere are few tidal gauges or wave rider buoys in the Western Isles and thus tides and extreme \n\nwater level heights were extrapolated by Richard and Phipps (2007) from nearby ports such as Stornoway, \n\nUllapool, Tobermory and Kinlochbervie (Table 3.3). The tidal regime in the Hebrides is semi-diurnal with a \n\nrange of up to five metres. \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 - Extreme water levels and local chart datum in metres above Ordnance Datum (Richard and Phipps, 2007). \n\nReturn Period \n\n(years) \n10 25 50 100 240 \n\nKinlochbervie 3.63 3.74 3.80 3.89 3.97 \n\nStornoway 3.22 3.33 3.39 3.47 3.55 \n\nUllapool 3.39 3.49 3.55 3.66 3.76 \n\nTobermory 3.31 3.45 3.52 3.63 3.71 \n\n57.48\u00b0N 5.87\u00b0E 3.36 3.45 3.50 3.60 3.70 \n\n \n\nThe coastline of the Western Isles is more prone to gales and similar storms than most of the coast \n\nof Europe. Mean monthly wind speeds range from about 12 knots in July/August to about 16 knots  in \n\nDecember/January, though daily mean wind speed over 30 knots  with gusts in excess of 50 knots  are not \n\nuncommon, even occasionally during the summer months. The highest gust recorded at Stornoway in recent \n\nyears was 98 knots in February 1962 (Contaminated Land: Implementation of Part IIA of the Environmental \n\nProtection Act, 2006). Atlantic storms are frequent, with severe events occurring at intervals. An \n\nextraordinary storm occurred in 2005 with deadly consequences and significant material losses. On 11th \n\nJanuary 2005, the islands and much of the west coast of Scotland were hit by the most severe storm in living \n\nmemory. Hurricane force winds ripped roofs from houses; roads, causeways and harbours connecting the \n\nlow-lying islands were destroyed; fishing boats were wrecked; and livestock drowned. The wave power to \n\nthe west of the Outer Hebrides is at the present moment being exploited as an important renewable energy \n\nresource. \n\n \n\n3.3.3. Stoneybridge \n\nSouth Uist is the second largest of the islands in the Western Isles, measuring some 22 miles north \n\nto south and 7 miles from east to west. The geography is divided into a series of north-south strips, each \n\nrunning the length of the island (Figure 3.12). The west coast faces onto the Atlantic and comprises around \n\n20 miles of beach, broken only by a headland at the half-way point. The South Uist coastline between \n\nArdivachar Point and Stoneybridge (Figure 3.13) is an exposed Atlantic coastline subject to on-going \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n74 \n \n\nsubmergence. The Stoneybridge to Ardivachar (ca. 8 miles north of Stoneybridge) beach and machair \n\nsystem likely responded to Holocene sea level and sediment supply constraints in the same way as other \n\nmachair systems in the Western Isles and were first developed sometime in the early to mid-Holocene \n\nbefore about 6500 years BP (Hansom and Angus, 2001). Stoneybridge is located on the west coast of South \n\nUist (Figure 3.13). The beach is sandy, with a shingle ridge that has been formed into an artificial knife edge \n\nshape (Figure 3.14). The area behind the ridge is machair, which slopes gently downwards (Richard and \n\nPhipps, 2007). The beach that extends between two outcrops of highly resistant Lewisian gneiss at \n\nArdivachar and at Stoneybridge is effectively a single system broken only by the rocky outcrops of and by \n\nthe exit of the Howmore River. The river exit is characterized by several sand-bars and by localized \n\nbackshore accretion with embryo dune formation. Seepage of ground water from the landward surfaces \n\nseasonally affects the beach so that the higher water-tables of winter intersect the gravels of the backshore \n\nstorm ridge. Such impounding of the winter water table has profound geomorphological and ecological \n\nconsequences, since the low-lying parts of the machair and dunes landward remain flooded to depths of up \n\nto 0.5m for up to five months of the year (Ritchie, 1971). The backshore ridge is affected by storm wave \n\nactivity and wave-transported gravels are found up to 50m inland flooring the erosion and deflation hollows \n\nin the dunes behind. To the south, near Stoneybridge, the backing dune and machair zone disappears and \n\nis replaced by a broad-crested coarse gravel ridge that reaches up to 10m above mean sea level and up to \n\n50m wide (Ritchie, 1971). Under storm conditions the ridge is subject to roll-over of the constituent gravels \n\nthat encroach into the area of marsh and lochs on the landward side. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13 \u2013 Geographical location of Stoneybridge. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n75 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14 - View of Stoneybridge (photo A.

Geographical and Geological setting \n\nIndonesia is an immense archipelago of more than 18,000 islands extending over 5000 km from \n\neast to west between 95\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 E, and crossing the equator from 6\u00b0 N to 11\u00b0 S. It is situated at the \n\nboundaries of three major plates: Eurasia, India-Australia, and Pacific-Philippine Sea. In western Indonesia, \n\nthe boundary between the Eurasian and Indian plates is the Sunda Trench (Figure 3.15). Parallel to this in \n\nSumatra is the right-lateral strike-slip Sumatran Fault, which results from the partitioning of oblique plate \n\nconvergence into normal convergence at the trench and trench-parallel movement further north. Most active \n\ndeformation in Sumatra occurs between the trench and the Sumatran fault. The subduction zones are mainly \n\nwell defined by seismicity extending to depths of about 600 km and by volcanoes (95 volcanoes have \n\nerupted since AD 1500). The Indonesian archipelago is located in one of the most tsunami-prone regions in \n\nthe world and has been affected by several important and destructive tsunami events caused by different \n\ngeological phenomena (i.e. volcanism- AD 1883 Krakatoa eruption; earthquake- 2004 Indian Ocean; \n\nsubmarine landslide: 1998 Papua New Guinea). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n76 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15 - Main geographical features of SE Asia (adapted from Hall, 2002). \n\n \n\nSumatra represents the geological continuation of the Malay Peninsula and contains extensive \n\noutcrops of Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks (Figure 3.16). In western Sumatra there are Paleozoic sediments \n\nthat range in age from Carboniferous to Triassic and Permian volcanic rocks (Hall, 2009). In contrast, in \n\neastern Sumatra, Carboniferous sediments include pebbly mudstones interpreted as diamictites that formed \n\nin a glacio-marine setting. The Mesozoic sedimentary record is very limited but suggests that much of \n\nSundaland (i.e. geographical area that encompasses the Sunda trench, Java, Sumatra, Borneo), including \n\nmost of its Indonesian margin, was emergent. Isotopic age-estimation in Sumatra indicates that there were \n\nseveral episodes of granite magmatism, interpreted to have occurred at an Andean-type margin, during the \n\nJurassic and Cretaceous. Marine sedimentary rocks were deposited in an intra-oceanic arc that collided with \n\nthe Sumatran margin in the Middle Cretaceous (Hall, 2009). The collision added arc and ophiolitic rocks to \n\nthe southern margin of Sumatra. Cenozoic rocks were deposited in sedimentary basins in and around \n\nSundaland. There are products of volcanic activity at subduction margins, and there are ophiolites, arc rocks \n\nand Australian continental crust added during collision. Little is known of the Late Cretaceous and \n\nPaleocene because of the paucity of rocks of this age (Hall, 2009). From Sumatra to Sulawesi, the southern \n\npart of Sundaland was probably mostly emergent during the Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic, and there \n\nwas widespread erosion; the oldest Cenozoic rocks typically rest unconformably on Cretaceous or older \n\nrocks. In the Java\u2013Sulawesi sector of the Sunda arc, volcanism greatly diminished during the Early and \n\nMiddle Miocene, although northward subduction continued (Hall, 2009). The decline in magmatism resulted \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n77 \n \n\nfrom Australian collision in eastern Indonesia, causing rotation of Borneo and Java. Northward movement of \n\nthe subduction zone prevented replenishment of the upper mantle source until rotation ceased in the late \n\nMiddle Miocene. Then, about 10 million years ago, volcanic activity resumed in abundance along the Sunda \n\narc from Java eastward. Since the Late Miocene, there has been thrusting and contractional deformation in \n\nSumatra and Java related to arrival of buoyant features at the trench, or increased coupling between the \n\noverriding and downgoing plates (Hall, 2009). Both islands have been elevated above sea level in the last \n\nfew million years. The Pliocene (Late Miocene?) wrench tectonics resulted in uplift along the Barisan \n\nMountains in Sumatra midlands and separated the North Sumatra Basin from the forearc region including \n\nthe Simeulue Basin. This was followed by formation of the Mentawai Fault in the Pliocene \u2013 Pleistocene that \n\noffsets the western flank of the basin and overprints the accretionary prism. Clastic sedimentation with shelf \n\nprogradation and deposition of pelagic turbidites in the deep basins has continued since the Late Miocene to \n\npresent day (Hall, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16 - Geological and tectonic map of Sumatra (Barber and Crow, 2005). \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n78 \n \n\n3.4.2.  Oceanography \n\nWith the second largest coastline in the world, Indonesia has remarkably little hard information \n\nabout the coastal waves that influence the shoreline and the coastal activities offshore and onshore. Reliable \n\nwave measurements over long periods of time are missing. Such data are of much importance to determine \n\nmorphological changes (by natural or human causes) and to determine hazards from extreme wave \n\nsituations caused by storms. The Indonesian Seas lie at the western edge of the Pacific trade wind belt \n\nwhere the persistent westerly directed wind stresses pile water up against the boundary. As a result, the \n\nannual mean sea-surface elevations are as much as 0.20m higher at the Pacific entrances to the \n\narchipelago south of the Philippines than in the Indian Ocean south of Java. The south-east Asian monsoon \n\nbrings strong east winds across the archipelago from May to early September and west wind- from \n\nNovember to March. \n\nThe only available wave regime data for Sumatra was presented by Meilianda et al. (2010). The \n\nauthors derived the wave climate of the Banda Aceh (Sumatra) coast from eleven-year daily wind data \n\nrecords from 1995 to 2005. The wind data were recorded by the Department of Meteorology and \n\nGeophysics in Banda Aceh, and subsequently translated into statistical wave heights and periods as \n\nfunctions of wind velocity, duration and fetch (CERC, 1992). About 53% of the waves approach the coast \n\nwith a significant wave height of 1.0m with a period of 3s, which was influenced by the southwest monsoon \n\nbetween April and September. During the northeast monsoon between October and March, 30% of the \n\nwaves were approaching from the northeast also with a significant wave height of 1.0m and a period of 4.5s. \n\nThese numbers show that the northwest coast of Banda Aceh is typically a low energy coast. \n\n \n\n3.4.3. Lhok Nga \n\nThe Lhok Nga Bay is a flat 5 km large coastal embayment (25 km\u00b2) opened to the west and \n\ndelimited by calcareous steep slopes (Figure 3.17). The coast prior to the 2004 tsunami appeared as a \n\ncontinuous beach, breached by small estuaries during the wet season. Bathymetry off Lhok Nga displays a \n\n20 km large continental shelf that is capable of providing great volumes of sediments (Paris et al., 2010b). \n\nThe main fringing reefs are located between Lampuuk and the Lhok Nga River (Paris et al., 2007). The \n\nlowest areas correspond to lagoons, swamps and rice crops. Small hills and hummocky terrains refer to \n\ndunes, beach ridges and palaeo-dunes reaching 15m above msl (e.g., Lampuuk, Lam Lho). In the southern \n\npart of the bay, the coastal morphology becomes more contrasted, especially south of the Lampuuk harbour, \n\nwhere the coast shows alternating cliffs and flat crescent-shaped bays and creeks. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n79 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17 - Geographical location of Lhok Nga. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.18 - Figure A \u2013 Image of Lhok Nga area obtained by satellite Ikonos immediately after the tsunami of December \n2004. Figure B \u2013 Orthophotography of Lhok Nga area obtained in June 2005. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n80 \n \n\nIn Lhok Nga, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami waves were almost 30m high and run-ups reached 50m \n\nabove msl (Lavigne et al., 2009). Eyewitnesses reported 10 to 12 waves, the second and third ones being \n\nthe highest. Both inflow and outflow produced extensive erosion, sediment transport and deposition until 5 \n\nkm inland (Paris et al., 2009). The erosional imprints of the tsunami extend to 500m from the shoreline and \n\nexceed 2 km along the river beds. The most eroded coasts were tangent to the tsunami wave train, which \n\ncame from the southwest (Figure 3.18). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n81 \n \n\n4. Methodology \n\nIn order to retrieve and analyse the sediment samples necessary to fulfil the objectives of this thesis \n\na wide range of techniques was used. The proxies used are regularly applied to extreme marine inundations \n\nsedimentological studies. The textural analysis (grain-size, percentage of carbonates and organic matter; \n\nand morphoscopy), microtextural characterization and mineralogical studies of the deposits and source \n\nmaterial are commonly used in the establishment of sedimentary provenance and in the characterization of \n\nthe deposit. In order to constrain the age of deposition of the units studied several age-estimation techniques \n\nwere used (OSL, radiocarbon, 210Pb and 137Cs). These techniques are also frequently applied to the study of \n\nHolocene extreme marine inundations and are universally used to directly date the tsunamigenic units or to \n\nobtain an age for them by dating the under and/or overlying units. \n\nA summary description of those techniques follows. \n\n \n\n4.1. Sampling and lithostratigraphic description \n\nSediment samples were obtained excavating trenches and using box-corers on trench walls, or \n\nusing a Livingstone corer, hand-operated Edelman or gauge augers and\\or a Van der Staay suction corer. \n\nVisual description of sediment was conducted focusing on colour, lithology, texture, contact between units, \n\nerosional features and macrofossil content. Sampling locations were geroreferenced and their elevation \n\nabove msl determined using a Zeiss Elta R 50 total station and one Leica DGPS RTK. Logs were plotted \n\nand correlations were established, when possible. Samples from present day sedimentary environments \n\n(e.g. nearshore, beach face, beach berm, dune, dune crest and alluvial plain) were collected by hand, using \n\na dredge or directly retrieved by scuba diving (nearshore samples). \n\n \n\n4.2. Textural analysis \n\n4.2.1. Grain-size analysis \n\nGrain size analysis was conducted using a set of sieves at 0.5? interval. Initially, the bulk samples \n\nwere washed with tap water and two fractions were separated (>63\u00b5m and&lt;63 \u00b5m) using a 4? mesh. The \n\nfiner fraction (<63\u00b5m) was analysed using the laser granulometer Malvern Mastersizer Hydro 2000 MU after \n\ndeflocculating with 30% Sodium hexametaphosphate. The coarser fraction (>63\u00b5m) was analysed \n\nexclusively through sieving, with exception of samples that had a coarser fraction weighting less than 10g. \n\nResults derived from both methods were assumed to be comparable. Statistical parameters of the grain size \n\ndistribution (e.g. mean grain size, ?10, ?90, median, mode, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness) of the \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n82 \n \n\nsamples were calculated using the graphic method (Folk and Ward, 1957) in the GranGraf software \n\n(Carvalho, 1998). A group of textural features were map-plotted to study their spatial distribution. This was \n\ndone using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method of interpolation between sampling points in the \n\nArcGis 9.3 environment. IDW is a method of interpolation that estimates cell values by weight-averaging the \n\nvalues of sample data points in the neighbourhood of each processing cell according to a non-linear function \n\nof distance (Davis, 1986). \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Calcium carbonate and organic matter content \n\nCalcium carbonate content \u2013 CaCO3 - (associated with bioclasts) was determined by measuring the \n\nvolume of carbon dioxide evolved during reaction with hydrochloric acid using an Eijkelkamp calcimeter \n\n(Eijkelkamp, 2008). Organic matter content (OM) was determined by loss-on-ignition at 550\u00ba C during 2h \n\nfollowing Bengtsson and Enell (1986). \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Morphoscopy \n\nQuartz-grain morphoscopy is the study leading to statistical determination of the different types of \n\nquartz grains in sandy deposits (Cailleux, 1942). The detailed observation of the surface of the grains (in \n\nterms of angularity, sphericity, shape, luster, corrosion, coatings), permits, in many cases, the establishment \n\nof the sedimentological agents that affected them prior or during transport or following immobilization. In \n\norder to establish tipology of quartz grains, samples from all study areas were observed and counted under \n\nthe binocular microscope (Leica EZ4; 30x). The fractions (1 to 3?) were selected for observation since the \n\nsmaller fractions require more magnification and the very coarse and very fine fractions tends to yield biased \n\nresults on roundness. The observation and counting of, at least, 100 grains per sample was conducted. \n\nGrains from each sample were counted and 3 major groups (i.e. bioclasts, lithic and quartz) were identified. \n\nBioclast fragments (eesencially Ca-carbonate, whole or fragmented shells and plant remains more or less \n\nfermented) and lithic grains were identified whenever possible. Quartz grains were further classified in terms \n\nof roundness and sphericity. The results of each sample were compiled and charts were produced. In some \n\ncases, other statistical analyses were conducted (e.g. principal component and cluster analysis) using \n\nStatistica 10 software. \n\n \n\n4.3. Microtextural analysis \n\nGrain surface microtexture (also named exoscopy - i.e. the micromorphological analysis of the \n\nsurface of grains) is an analysis usually reserved for quartz particles of the dimension of sand and coarser \n\nparticles. Many quartz sand grains develop microtextural features that can often be referred to specific \n\ntransport processes or specific sedimentary environments. In order to recognize surface microtextures, a \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n83 \n \n\nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to obtain high resolution images [JEOL JSM 5200 LV \n\n(Lisbon) and a JEOL JSM-5910 LV (Clermont-Ferrand)]. \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Laboratory procedure \n\nA minimum of 12 quartz grains per sample (maximum of 30 grains; mean of 16 grains) from the 1 to \n\n3? (125-500\u00b5m) size fraction were randomly selected under the binocular microscope and prepared for \n\nSEM analyses. This involved either mineralization with gold (Lisbon, FCUL) or metallization with carbon \n\n(Clermont-Ferrand University) of the particles. The grains were then taken to the SEM lab and photographs \n\nobtained. After this process, a visual analyse of each grain would follow focusing in a group of microtextural \n\ncharacteristics. \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Microtextural classification \n\nThe microtextural classification was established based on selected references (e.g. Mahaney, \n\n2002) and in the author visual criteria. Each grain was characterized using a number of descriptive \n\nmicrotextural features revealed in SEM microphotographs (e.g. fresh surfaces, percussion marks, dissolution \n\nfeatures, angularity and adhering particles). The microtextures (Figure 4.1) can be characterized as follows: \n\n1) Angularity - classified using Powers scale (Powers, 1953). \n\n2) Fresh surfaces \u2013 microtexture characterized by the presence of mechanical marks (i.e. fractures, \n\nabrasion marks, sharp edges) that are responsible for the recent exposure of part, or the totality, of \n\nthe grain surface. These are also habitually characterised by the absence of chemical dissolution or \n\nprecipitation in those new surfaces. \n\n3) Percussion marks - microtextures characterised by the presence of, usually, V-shaped \n\ndepressions, typically the result of grain collision. \n\n4) Adhering particles \u2013 characterized by the presence of microparticles on the surface of quartz \n\ngrains. Usually, these microparticles are within grooves and many are attached to the surfaces of \n\nindividual grains. \n\n5) Dissolution - microtexture of chemical nature indicating the degree of dissolution on the surface of \n\nindividual grains. The effects of dissolution are noticed by the destruction of fresh surfaces and \n\nsharp edges on the surface of the grains and by the formation of grooves. \n\n \n\nA semi-quantitative approach to the microtextural classification of each grain was used, based upon \n\nthe proportion of grain surface occupied by each feature [0 (absent) to 5 (> 75% of the grain surface)]. The \n\nangularity of the grains was classified from 0 to 5 (very rounded to very angular). Median values for each \n\nvariable were calculated for each sample and used in the subsequent statistical analysis. Results were \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n84 \n \n\ninterpreted based on the knowledge of present day coastal environments and supported by standard \n\nstatistical methods (using Statistica 10 software) including principal components and classificatory analyses. \n\nKruskal-Wallis tests (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952) were conducted and p-values were calculated to test the \n\nstatistical significance of the results (p<0.05; indicating that at least the mean value of one population is \n\ndifferent from the others). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Microtextural features. A0 to A5 \u2013 angularity (very rounded to very angular). B1 \u2013 percussion marks. B2 \u2013 \ndetailed view of percussion mark. C1 \u2013 fresh surface (in this case, sharp edge, fractures and steps). C2 \u2013 detailed view of \nfresh surface. D \u2013 dissolution (especially visible on the right face of the grain). E \u2013 adhering particles (more visible in the \n\ncenter of the grain). \n\n \n\nIn the literature, the number of grains reported as necessary for sedimentological interpretation \n\nvaries within a wide range (cf. Mahaney, 2002; Costa et al., 2012b for a summary and examples). In this \n\nstudy, an empirical assessment was conducted to evaluate the minimum size of the sample with statistical \n\nmeaning, focusing on the number of grains required to hold the median value characterizing each \n\nmicrotextural attribute reasonably constant within the sample. Our results suggest that the median value is \n\nabout 20 grains. \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Atlas of microtextural features in quartz grains \n\nWith the collected samples, and after laboratory treatment, a large number of SEM photos of the \n\nquartz grains were gathered. A group of twenty microtextures visible in the surface of quartz grains was \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n85 \n \n\nidentified and described and an atlas was compiled using selected photos to facilitate the identification of \n\nthose microtextures. The microtextural atlas of quartz grains is presented in Annex 2. \n\n \n\n4.4. Mineralogy \n\n4.4.1. Heavy minerals \n\nHeavy mineral assemblages often reflect the provenance of Quaternary deposits. Heavy minerals \n\nare those with a specific gravity greater than 2.85 and are usually separated from the lighter mineral fraction \n\nin a sample by settling in a heavy liquid such as bromoform (Specific Gravity of 2.89) (Whalley, 1990). \n\nSamples (1 to 3? fraction) from a wide range of sedimentary environments (e.g. nearshore, dune and \n\nbeach) and from tsunami and storm deposits were prepared in order to observe heavy minerals under the \n\nmicroscope in slides and to contribute to on-going provenance studies on heavy mineral characterization of \n\ntsunami and storm deposits. The slides were prepared as followed: samples were first washed using tap \n\nwater. They were then wet sieved using a set of sieves at 0.5? interval. The sand fraction was assembled in \n\nthe 1-3? fractions (125-500\u00b5m). Heavy minerals present were separated using bromoform and then \n\nmounted using Entelan resin on glass slides. The required amount of grains for each slide was obtained \n\nusing a micro-splitter. About 300 transparent heavy minerals per slide samples were identified and counted \n\nunder an Olympus BX40 petrographic microscope in each sample. \n\n \n\n4.4.2. Micromorphology analyses \n\nSediment samples from Boca do Rio and Voe of Scatsta were collected for micromorphology \n\nanalyses using the methodology described by Murphy (1986). The thin sections used in this study were \n\nprepared by Julie Boreham (Earthslides). It is standard to take samples by using rigid metal tins (box \n\ncorers), and wrapping the sediment or soil with cling film, tissue and tape, in order to keep it intact and \n\nundisturbed in transit to the laboratory. The raw samples are then air dried, or in some instances lyophilized \n\ndried to remove all water before impregnation with a crystic polyester resin. It usually takes 6 weeks for the \n\nimpregnated samples to cold cure to a 'rock hard' stage. After this, an additional 4 weeks of sectioning \n\nproduction time is usually required, making the total turn-around time about 10 weeks. The final glass thin-\n\nsections are 25-30\u00b5m thick by 0.08m long, which enables the researcher to identify and understand the \n\nminerals, organic materials, and the sediment or soil structure and composition using the microscope \n\n(Olympus BX40). \n\n \n\n4.5. Age-estimation methods \n\nThe techniques used in this work were selected because they were considered to be better suited \n\nfor the time interval and sediments studied in this research. However, age-estimation of extreme marine \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n86 \n \n\ninundations is, in most cases, problematic. Results tend to be difficult to interpret and in many situations the \n\ndates obtained are not accurate. The samples from Stoneybridge and Lhok Nga (Indonesia) are from \n\ncontemporary events and have been collected immediately after the extreme marine inundations (i.e. the \n\nGreat Storm of January 2005 and the 2004 Tsunami, respectively). \n\n \n\n4.5.1. OSL \n\nOptically Stimulated Luminescence dating (a development of Thermoluminescence) is used for \n\ndating terrigenous sediments, where exposure to light prior to burial has been extensive and non-existent \n\nafter burial. The information given by OSL is therefore the time elapsed since the last episode of exposure to \n\nlight or light-bleaching episode of the grains (Aitken, 1992). This technique measures the luminescence \n\nemitted from the most light-sensitive electron traps in minerals - essentially quartz and feldspars - (Wintle et \n\nal., 1994), though more recently illite and muscovite have been used with promising results, this energy \n\nbeing stored in the crystalline network and increasing with burial time. Luminescence age-estimation \n\nmethods have previously been applied to tsunami deposits using thermoluminescence (e.g. Bryant et al., \n\n1996; Dawson et al., 1995), infra-red stimulated luminescence (e.g. Huntley and Clague, 1996; Ollerhead et \n\nal., 2001) and optically stimulated luminescence (e.g. Banerjee et al., 2001; Cunha et al., 2010). \n\nIn brief, the laboratory treatment consists of a series of conventioned sample preparation \n\ntechniques (e.g. sieving, acid leaching and oxidation with 10% HCl, 10% H2O2, 40% HF) after extrusion of \n\nthe sediment under controlled laboratory lighting condition. The grains are mounted on stainless steel discs \n\nand then counted. Equivalent Dose (De) values are obtained through calibrating the \u201cnatural\u201d optical signal, \n\nacquired during burial, against \u201cregenerated\u201d optical signals obtained by administering known amounts of \n\nlaboratory dose. The luminescence age is obtained by dividing De value by the mean total dose rate value. \n\nThe OSL results presented in this study have been obtained by collaborative work involving the Department \n\nof Earth Sciences, Marine and Environmental Research Centre, University of Coimbra (Portugal), Centro de \n\nGeof\u00edsica, Department of Earth Sciences, University of \u00c9vora, Portugal and the Nordic Laboratory for \n\nLuminescence Dating, Department of Earth Sciences, Aarhus University, Ris\u00f8, Denmark. \n\n \n\n4.5.2. \n210\n\nPb and \n137\n\nCs \n\n210Pb is an unstable isotope present in the atmosphere and is produced by the decay of 222Rn, \n\nwhich is part of the U series - decay chain. This isotope is absorbed by the sediments where it decays to \n\nstable 206Pb over an interval of circa 150 years. By measuring the ratio between 210Pb and 206Pb in a column \n\nof sediment in relation to depth, and assuming that the atmospheric flux of 210Pb has remained constant, the \n\ntime that has elapsed since the radioactive lead was deposited can be determined (Olsson, 1986). The \n\nsedimentation rate can then be established by using the vertical concentration profile of 210Pb excess to infer \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n87 \n \n\na uniform sedimentation rate using the constant rate supply method (Appleby and Oldfield, 1983). The \n\nlaboratory procedure was followed according with description by Eakins and Morrison (1978). \n\n137Cs is an artificially generated radioactive nuclide (half-life of 30 years) that has only been \n\nproduced in significant quantities as a result of thermonuclear weapons testing, which began in 1945. The \n\ntemporal patterns of 137Cs input can be characterised by:  \n\n1) detectable 137Cs in the northern hemisphere began in 1954, though some authors use a \n\nthreshold of 1950; \n\n2) the second a remarkable peak in 137Cs corresponds to 1962-1964, congruent with a maximum \n\nin thermonuclear testing. \n\nSome areas had additional input in 1986 after the Chernobyl incident but to the present state of knowledge \n\nthis is not the case of Portugal. This annual variation has been successfully used to determine sediment \n\naccumulation rates in a wide variety of depositional environments including reservoirs, lakes, wetlands, \n\ncoastal areas, and flood plains. Identification of 137Cs loss and gain for each sampled location in the study \n\nsite is made by comparison of the measurement done using gamma spectrometry from the reference sites \n\nwith those from the study field, allowing the establishment of a sedimentation rate. Sediment samples used \n\nfor 210Pb and 137Cs were measured at the University of Bordeaux (France) and ISMAR (Italy). \n\n \n\n4.5.3. Radiocarbon \n\n14C which is continually being produced in the upper atmosphere becomes stored in various global \n\nreservoirs (atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere) and is absorved by living organisms. All living \n\norganisms absorb carbon dioxide during tissue building in a ratio that is broadly in equilibrium with \n\natmospheric carbon dioxide. After the death of the organisms the 14C decays to 14N. The activity of 14C in the \n\natmosphere is known (15 disintegrations per minute per gram of total carbon, on average). The half-life of \n\n14C was originally calculated at 5568\u00b130 years (Libby, 1955), but subsequently this has been more \n\naccurately determined as 5730\u00b140 years (Godwin, 1962). However, the value that is used by convention is \n\nthe former due to the large number of dates that had been produced prior to the new measurement. The \n\nlogarithmic decay curve for radiocarbon is well established (e.g. Stuiver et al., 1998) and calculations can be \n\nmade using this curve (up to app. 50000 years, which is approximately 8 times the half-life of 14C). \n\nThere are four fundamental assumptions of radiocarbon age-estimation: the production of 14C is constant \n\nover time; the 14C:12C ratio in the biosphere and hydrosphere is in equilibrium with the atmospheric ratio; the \n\ndecay rate of 14C can be established; a closed system has existed since the death of the organism. Over the \n\nyears, these assumptions have been questioned but they can still be accepted in general terms. Two \n\napproaches are used to measure the residual 14C activity in a sample: the conventional radiocarbon dating \n\nor the Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n88 \n \n\nThe first involves the detection and counting of ? emissions from 14C atoms over a period of time in order to \n\ndetermine the rate of emissions and hence the activity of the sample. In the calculation of radiocarbon dates \n\nobtained by conventional methods, laboratories compare sample activities to a modern reference standard. \n\nThe second uses particle accelerators as mass spectrometers to count the actual number of 14C atoms as \n\nopposed to their decay products (Aitken, 1990; Bowman, 1990). Comparing the two methodologies, one can \n\nconclude that AMS allows the measurements of much smaller samples and is quicker. \n\nThe time in years since the death of an organism can be calculated from the following equation (e.g. Stuiver \n\net al., 1998): \n\n  \n \n\n \n     \n\n  \n\n \n    Equation 4.1 \n\n \n\nWhere ? is the decay constant of 14C, A0 is the 14C activity of the modern reference standard, and A is the \n\nmeasured 14C activity of the sample of unknown age. \n\nThe sources of error in 14C dating are the temporal variations in 14C production, the isotopic fractionation, the \n\ncirculation of marine carbon, the contamination of the samples (especially in shells - often used in \n\npalaeotsunami research) and the biogeochemistry of lake sediments. The radiocarbon dates used in this \n\nwork were obtained at Beta Analytic Inc. (AMS) and their standard laboratory protocol was followed. \n\nCalibration was done using the CALIB 6.0 Radiocarbon program coupled with the IntCal09 curve (Stuiver \n\nand Reimer, 1993). \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n89 \n \n\n5  Results \n\n5.1. Salgados \n\n5.1.1. Lithostratigraphic features \n\nIn total, 158 sediment cores (up to 5 m) were obtained from the Salgados lowland (Figure 5.1.1) \n\nusing a hand-operated gouge, Edelman augers, van der Horst, van der Staay and Livingstone corers (as \n\ndescribed in Chapter 4). Moreover, approximately 30 surface samples from present-day sedimentary \n\nenvironments, including the nearshore between 6 and 19m below msl, beach face, beach berm, dune and \n\ndune crest were collected by hand or directly collected from the sea bottom by scuba diving (Figure 5.1.1). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.1 \u2013 Cores and surface samples collected in Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n90 \n \n\nThe lithostratigraphy of the lagoonal area is summarized in a schematic synthetic log based on cores \n\ncollected in Lagoa dos Salgados showing six lithostratigraphic units deposited on top of the Plio-Pleistocene \n\n(Areias de Faro-Quarteira) basal sand (Figure 5.1.2). Eleven sediment samples were collected from organic-\n\nrich layers or laminae in different cores where the major lithostratigraphical units were clearly identified and \n\nallowing for lateral correlations (see below; Table 5.1). \n\nUnit A \u2013 The lowermost unit, with a maximum thickness of 2.48m (core SG1), rests unconformably \n\non the reddish fluviatile Plio-Pleistocene materials and is characterized in the seaward region of the basin by \n\nalternations of yellowish to grey sand with marine shell fragments and less abundant and thinner clay \n\nlaminae. One radiocarbon date (see below) obtained from an organic mud lamina of the upper section of this \n\nunit, at 4.32m below surface (i.e. ca. 3m below msl) in SG1, yielded a radiocarbon age of ca. 4790 \u00b1 50 \n\nyears Cal BC (Figure 5.1.2 and Table 5.1). This indicates that most of the coarser sediment of the basal unit \n\naccumulated in an essentially high-energy and shallow environment open to marine influence (e.g. ?13C \n\nvalue), preceding the pronounced drop in sea-level rise rate at 6000 to 7000 cal BP that characterizes the \n\nHolocene transgression in the Algarve and elsewhere along the western Portuguese coast (Freitas et al., \n\n2003; Teixeira et al., 2005; Vis, 2009). Two samples (obtained from cores SG1 and SG46) were used for \n\nsedimentological characterization of this unit. The values obtained for each core were conditioned by their \n\nposition in terms of proximity to the coast confirming field observations: core SG1 presented 77.2% of \n\ncoarse material (>63 \u00b5m), 8.9% for CaCO3 content and 1.6% of organic matter (OM). On the other hand \n\ncore SG46 (farther inland) presented 18.5% of coarse material, 1.1% for CaCO3 content and 3.8% in terms \n\nof OM. \n\nUnit B \u2013 This unit, with a maximum thickness of 1.32m (core SG44), is mainly composed of grey to \n\nbrown mud with occasional intercalated layers of coarser sediment which wedge out laterally, indicating a \n\nsignificant decrease in the energy level of the environment with increased input of fine-grained terrigenous \n\nmaterials. The radiocarbon dates (obtained in different cores at ca. 2.4m to 3.1m below surface, i.e. ca. 1.0m \n\nto 1.6m below msl) constrain the deposition of this unit within the 3700 to 980 years Cal BC time span \n\n(Figure 5.1.2 and Table 5.1), a period of quasi-stability of mean sea level that should have favoured the \n\nbuild-up of the barrier and beach-dune system at the exposed facade of the Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara embayment \n\nand increased the frequency of sediment choking of the inlet, thus favouring the retention of terrigenous \n\nsediment (e.g. ?13C value) within the lowland. Twelve samples from 8 different cores allowed \n\ncharacterization of this unit in terms of average and standard deviation percentages of coarse material, \n\nCaCO3 and OM, the values were 22.9\u00b114%, 10.7\u00b19.3% and 5.4\u00b11.6% respectively, indicating marine \n\nsignature but reduction of the energy level across the whole basin. \n\nUnit C \u2013 This unit rests conformably with the under and overlying units (Figure 5.1.2). It essentially \n\nconsists of yellowish to greyish medium to fine sand containing marine shell (essentially bivalves) fragments, \n\nand exhibits normal (fining upward) grading. Sand is intercalated with numerous muddy laminae. It presents \n\na maximum thickness of ca. 3.25m (core SG2). An age range (approximately 3000 to 1500 Cal BP) for this \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n91 \n \n\nunit was estimated in context with the radiocarbon ages obtained for units B and D. Thirty three samples \n\nfrom thirteen different cores allowed characterization of this unit in terms of percentage of coarse material, \n\nCaCO3 and OM; the average and standard deviation values were: for the mud dominated intercalations - \n\n25.3\u00b115.1%, 11.6\u00b19.4% and 5.87\u00b13.0% respectively; and for the sand dominated material: 90.1\u00b19.9% and \n\n20.8\u00b19.9%, respectively, the OM being virtually nil. \n\nUnit D \u2013 This unit is composed of brownish silt and clay material that becomes darker to the top. It \n\npresents a maximum thickness of approximately 0.75m (core SG46) and exhibits an abrupt contact with the \n\noverlying unit E. Five radiocarbon dates were obtained from organic sediment (at ca. 0.45 to 0.75m below \n\nsurface, i.e. ca. 0.65 to 0.85m above msl) of this unit (Table 5.1) constraining its age of deposition between \n\nyears Cal AD 420 and 1030. Thirty five samples from thirty two different cores allowed characterization of \n\nthis unit in terms of percentage of coarse material, CaCO3 and OM content; the average and standard \n\ndeviation values were 12.2\u00b116.7%, 9.2\u00b17.0% and 4.1\u00b11.3% respectively. \n\nUnit E \u2013 this unit is essentially composed of medium to fine sand, which contrasts markedly with the \n\nunderlying sediment of unit D and is separated from it by an unconformity (Figure 5.1.3). Unit E is widely \n\ndistributed in the lowland and present in several cores although its thickness decreases (from 0. 79 m \u2013 core \n\nSG LV 10 - to a few mm further inland \u2013 e.g. core SG 26) up to its landward limit ca. 800m from the present \n\nday coastline. The altitude of the basal contact of unit E rises gradually inland from ca. -0.05 m up to 1.28m \n\nabove msl. This unit is laterally variable in terms of its thickness and sedimentary characteristics. It is \n\nobserved in its seaward section as a massive sandy deposit with no identifiable laminations and without \n\nsedimentary structures. Several centimetre-sized mud rip-up clasts from the underlying unit were identified \n\nthroughout this unit although more noticeable at its base. However, further inland this unit is characterized \n\nby finer sediments; this spatial contrast is expressed by higher ?10, ? 50 and ? 90 (implying shift towards \n\nfiner size interval of the whole >63\u00b5m grain size spectrum) with increasing distance to the inlet, and \n\nsimultaneous enrichment in mud-sized particles. Forty five samples from forty two different cores allowed \n\ncharacterization of this unit in terms of percentage of coarse material, CaCO3 and MO. The average and \n\nstandard deviation values for the massive sand were 87.6\u00b14.9%, 28.7\u00b19.0% respectively, with no OM. \n\nFurther inland the corresponding values were 54.24\u00b115.5%, 23.0\u00b17.7% and 2.32\u00b10.54%. \n\nUnit F \u2013 The topmost unit is characterized as a dark brown silty/clayish layer presenting a maximum \n\nthickness of 2.20m (core SG47) and corresponds to the present-day sedimentary environment. In the field, \n\nunits F and D are indistinguishable in places were unit E is absent. The upper (0.20m to 0.10m) centimetres \n\nof this unit are, in places, black. Field observations revealed some coarser intercalations (e.g. SG14_0.20-\n\n0.28 \u2013 storm deposit? \u2013 also present in other cores in the coastal edge of the lagoon) within the mud \n\nrestricted to an area closer to the inlet and extending northwest along the back barrier. 210Pb and 137Cs \n\nsedimentation rates were established for the top 0.30m of the stratigraphic column (Figure 5.1.2) and the \n\nresults suggest that the low-energy deposits resting on top of the coarser unit E in core SG48 are younger \n\nthan AD 1865. Forty four samples from thirty five different cores allowed characterization of unit F in terms of \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n92 \n \n\nthe percentage of coarse material, CaCO3 and OM. The bulk of unit F yielded average and standard \n\ndeviation values of 18.8\u00b114.2%, 9.2\u00b14.2% and 4.5\u00b11.32%, respectively. In contrast, the coarser \n\nintercalations presented values of 66.6\u00b19.6%, 20.3\u00b18.2% respectively, the OM being virtually absent. \n\nResults indicate a time-integrated accumulation rate derived from the vertical profile of 210Pb excess of ca. \n\n2.6mm/yr. Moreover, taking AD 1963 as the maximum nuclear testing in the northern hemisphere (Ritchie \n\nand McHenry, 1990) the accumulation rate obtained from the 137Cs peak at 0.10m below surface is \n\n2.3mm/yr, which is in rough agreement with the value inferred from 210Pb (Figure 5.1.2). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.2 - Schematic log of Lagoa dos Salgados showing main Holocene lithostratigraphic units resting upon Plio-\nPleistocene dissected basement (see text for details); the relative location of cores from which 11 radiocarbon dates and \n\none 210Pb and 137Cs concentration profile were obtained are also shown in Figure 5.1.1. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n93 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.3 \u2013 Photos of contact of Unit E with under and overlying units identified in Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\n \n\nA repeating lithostratigraphic sequence occurs in the flat-floored depression of Lagoa dos Salgados \n\n(Figure 5.1.4). Within this stratigraphical sequence a peculiar feature was observed in the geometrical \n\ndistribution of unit E. This unit is thicker in the coastal edge of the lowland space and it decreases to \n\nmillimetric thickness in the northern part of the Lagoa dos Salgados, just before wedging out. In Figure 5.1.4 \n\nin profile A-A\u2019, it is observed that unit E decreases its thickness with increasing distance inland, presenting \n\nca. 0.50m in the core section nearest to the coast and decreasing to millimetric thickness at about 400m \n\ninland. In addition, the elevation of the basal contact increases inland. On the other hand, profiles B-B\u2019 and \n\nC-C\u2019 exhibit unit E consisting of a very thin (centimetric) sand lamina quickly disappearing inland. Thus, one \n\ncan conclude that unit E is a distinct wedge-shaped and ramping up lens of coarse sediment extending \n\nacross the lowland for several hundred meters inland, being thickest at the coast, closest to the present-day \n\ninlet. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n94 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.4 \u2013 Cross-sections based in the lithostratigraphical correlation of cores collected across the Salgados lowland. \nA-Profile N-S; B- Profile NE-SW; C- Profile NW-SE.

Textural features \n\nThe analysis of the geographical variation of a group of geometrical, compositional and textural \n\nfeatures (e.g. thickness, percentage of sand, percentage of Ca carbonates, ?10, ?50, ? 90, mean, mode, \n\nstandard deviation, kurtosis and skewness) of sediment from unit E was also conducted (Table 5.2). The \n\npercentage of sand (Figure 5.1.5A), decreases inland with maximum values (up to 100%) in the south-\n\neastern areas of the basin and presents lowest values (up to 20%) in the northern and north-western sectors \n\nof the lowland. The lower values found closer to the landward edge of the deposit mirror the decreasing \n\ntransport competence and capacity of a landward transport mechanism. However, it may, in cases, be also \n\ninfluenced by the very small thicknesses of the unit E in the more distal locations, where field subsampling \n\ncould not avoid contamination of the sand by the over and underlying mud. The space distribution of mean \n\ngrain size (Figure 5.1.5A) exhibits a pattern congruent with that of the proportion of sand. The largest values \n\n(460\u00b5m) occur in the south-eastern area and the lowest values in the north and northwest sectors. Similar \n\npatterns were also observed for median, mode, ?90 and ?10 parameters (Table 5.2). \n\nThe analysis of textural parameters indicates that unit E is coarser and thicker across the southern \n\npart of Salgados basin whereas the majority of the finer-grained sediment occurs in the northern to north-\n\nwestern part (Figure 5.1.5 and 5.1.6). These features point to a seaward source of unit E and dispersion \n\npath from seaward (coarser and thicker) to landward (finer and thinner). According to Friedman (1961) \n\npositive skewness in medium to fine sand could be the result of unidirectional flow or the result of rapid \n\ndeposition preventing the washing out of finer particles. In our study (Figure 5.1.6B) a skewness pattern \n\ncompatible with the above mentioned interpretation can be observed. The combination of textural results \n\nand geometrical data also suggest a north-south trending area (possibly a palaeo-channel) in the middle of \n\nthe basin as a preferred route through which sediment was transported inland. It is also worth noting that \n\nregardless the distance to this channel, the plot of textural attributes in Figures 5.1.5 and 5.1.6 trend \n\nobliquely to the elongation of the barrier. In cores where unit E has more than 0.03m thick its mean grain \n\nsize is ca. 1.5 ? (i.e. 370\u00b5m), it varies considerably with location within the lowland. When comparison is \n\nestablished between these sediments and their possible sources, represented by the studied present-day \n\nanalogues, the widest variation in mean grain size is detected in sand from unit E, ranging from 1.05 ? to 3.5 \n\n? (Table 5.2). The distal nearshore samples (collected between 11m and 19m below msl) and materials \n\nfrom unit D are slightly finer grained, presenting an average mean diameter of ca. 2.50 ? and 2.20 ?, \n\nrespectively. By contrast, the beach and dune sedimentary environments exhibit lower values (i.e. coarser \n\nsediments) of 0.75 ? and 1 ?, respectively. \n\nIn the few cores that allowed the study of the vertical variation of textural attributes within unit E, the mean \n\ngrain size (also the percentage of sand and percentage of Ca carbonate) remain virtually invariant or slightly \n\ndecreasing up unit (Table 5.2). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n97 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.5 \u2013 A - Interpolated values of Unit E median grain size.

Morphoscopic features \n\nMorphoscopic analyses were conducted in a group of samples (unit E, dune, beach and \n\nnearshore). Sediment obtained from core SG14_(0.20-0.28) and possibly corresponding to a  storm deposit  \n\nwas also studied. The samples were divided into three groups, each group corresponding to contrasting \n\ndepositional environments: Unit E and sample SG14_(0.20-0.28), representing high-energy single events; \n\ndune and beach; nearshore. Samples from Unit E were observed: as a profile (with increasing distance from \n\nthe coast) SG14_(0.40-0.82)-SG20-SG22-SG26; with samples within unit from 2 cores: LV7 and LV10; and \n\na possible storm deposit sample SG14_(0.20-0.28). Dune samples also present a profile roughly \n\ncorresponding to an outline from the coast-inland (with one dune crest sample \u2013 SG_Duna2_Crista). \n\nNearshore samples were collected at different depths below msl offshore the Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara bay. The \n\nbasic morphoscopic data for each group is presented in the same order: composition (Figures 5.1.7, 5.1.10 \n\nand 5.1.13); roundness (Figures 5.1.8, 5.1.11 and 5.1.14); sphericity (Figures 5.1.9, 5.1.12 and 5.1.15). \n\nThese results are complement by other morphoscopic data presented as histograms in: Figure 5.1.16 [Unit \n\nE and SG14_(0.20-0.28)], Figure 5.1.17 and Figure 5.1.18 (beach and dune) and Figure 5.1.19 (nearshore). \n\nIn Figure 5.1.7 it is possible to observe the compositional characteristics of Unit E deposits and sample \n\nSG14_(0.20-0.28). The percentage of quartz grains, lithic material and bioclasts is shown. In terms of the \n\npercentage of quartz grains, Unit E samples are typically in the 60-75% range. This is in contrast with \n\nsample SG14_(0.20-0.28) that presents a value above 80% of quartz grains. Moreover, in terms of the \n\npercentage of lithic material it can be observed that all samples present values in the order of 10-15% with \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n101 \n \n\nthe exception of LV10_(0.80-0.81), LV10_(0.90-0.91) and SG26 that present values of 6%, 18% and 18% \n\nrespectively. In what concerns the percentage of bioclasts, it was observed that all samples from Unit E \n\npresent values between 15% and 30%, while sample SG14_(0.20-0.28) presents a considerably lower \n\nvalue(5%). \n\nIn terms of roundness for the same group of samples (Figure 5.1.8) it is possible to perceive that \n\nthe highest values for well-rounded and rounded grains (app. 50%) were detected in samples LV10_(0.46-\n\n0.47) and LV10_(0.90-0.91) respectively top and base of Unit E. Moreover, in core LV7 the base of unit E \n\npresents higher percentage of well-rounded and rounded grains when compared with the top of the unit. In \n\nall other samples values for well-rounded and rounded grains are in the 25%-40% range. In what concerns \n\nvery angular and angular grains it was possible to visualize that most samples present values in the order of \n\n40%-50%, the exception being cores LV7 and LV10. Furthermore, in core LV10 it was possible to establish \n\na roughly decreasing upward trend on the presence of very angular and angular grains within Unit E (values \n\nranging between 15 and 30%) whereas on core LV7 the base of the deposits presented values of 35% for \n\nvery angular and angular grains and the top of the deposit presented higher values (44%).  \n\nFigure 5.1.9 presents the shape characteristics for the same group of samples. Spherical grains were \n\nobserved in 20%-35% of the samples and the lowest sphericity values were detected in samples SG20 and \n\nLV7_(0.40-0.41). In what concerns prismatic and sub-prismatic shapes it was perceived that all samples \n\ntypically presented values in the range 30%-40% with the exception of sample LV10_(0.46-0.47) that \n\npresented a value of 21% . The lowest value of spherical grains was observed in sample 14_(0.20-0.28) with  \n\n15%. In terms of discoidal and sub-discoidal grains no trend was possible to observe because all values \n\nwere detected within the 35%-50% without any discernible peculiarity \n\nFigure 5.1.10 presents the dune and beach samples compositional characteristics. All samples \n\npresent quartz grains in the range of 50% to 60%. Regarding the percentage of lithic material it was \n\nobserved that sample Dune_2RR (farther inland) presented the highest value, with 26% of lithic sediment \n\nwhile all the other samples presented lithics between 14% (i.e. Face_Praia \u2013 beach face) and 20% (e.g.  \n\nDuna - dune). Bioclasts are present in all samples (25%-30%) with the exception of sample Duna_2RR with \n\n16% of bioclasts. A slightly inland decreasing trend of the percentage of bioclasts was detected. \n\nIn terms of roundness, in the dune and beach samples from Lagoa dos Salgados (Figure 5.1.11), \n\nthe well-rounded and rounded grains were present in the range 25%-50% in the dune samples (with a slight \n\nincreasing inland trend) while the beach samples present values between 17% (i.e. Praia_TdV) and 45% \n\n(e.g. Berma). In what concerns very angular and angular grains, dune samples presented values ranging \n\nfrom 15% (i.e. Duna_2RR) to 34 % (i.e. Duna) whereas beach samples presented higher values ranging \n\nfrom 30% to 60%. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n102 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.7 - Compositional characteristics of sample from unit E and sample 14_(0.20-0.28) from Lagoa dos Salgados, \nbased in morphoscopic observation. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.8 - Roundness classification of quartz grains from unit E and sample 14_(0.20-0.28) from Lagoa dos Salgados, \nbased in morphoscopic analysis. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n103 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.9 \u2013 Lagoa dos Salgados unit E and sample 14_(0.20-0.28) shape characteristics based in morphoscopic \nobservation. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.10 \u2013 Dune and beach samples (Lagoa dos Salgados) compositional characteristics based in morphoscopic \nobservation. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n104 \n \n\n Figure 5.1.12 presents the data obtained by analysing the shape of dune and beach samples from \n\nLagoa dos Salgados. Spherical grains were observed in higher percentage in dune samples (20%-30%) \n\nthan in beach samples (<20%) although sample Berma presented 29% of spherical grains. This result, \n\ncoupled with higher proportion of spherical grains in the dune samples farther inland might suggest an \n\nincreasing inland trend. In terms of discoidal and sub-discoidal grains it was observed that beach samples \n\ntypically presented values of ca. 55% (except Berma with 40%) for these types of grain shape. By contrast, \n\ndune samples presented values that ranged from 28% (Duna_2F) to 54% (Duna_F). No clear spatial trend \n\nwas identified. Regarding prismatic and sub-prismatic grains all samples presented values between 20% \n\nand 30% with no perceptible pattern. \n\n Figure 5.1.13 presents the compositional features of the nearshore samples collected within the \n\nSalgados/Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara bay. In compositional terms the nearshore samples are in contrast with other \n\nsamples observed in Lagoa dos Salgados. In fact, they present very high percentages of bioclasts ranging \n\nfrom 50% to 70%, with the exception of ArmP_19m (sample farther offshore) with 34% of bioclasts. In what \n\nconcerns lithic material all samples presented similar values within the 15%-30% interval. In none of the two \n\nabove mentioned features a spatial trend was identified. Regarding the quartz percentage it was observed \n\nthat the samples with higher percentage of quartz grains were ArmP_11m and ArmP_19m (which are the \n\nsamples closest and farthest located from the coastline) with 36% and 47% respectively. All the other \n\nsamples presented values between 10% and 25%. \n\nThe study of roundness of the nearshore samples (Figure 5.1.14) yieldied values for very angular \n\nand angular grains within the 20%-30% range with no observed spatial trend. The only two exceptions were \n\nsamples ArmP_19 and ArmP_17.1 that present values of 16% and nil. Well-rounded and rounded grains \n\npresented percentage between 40% and 60% with no clear trend detectable. \n\nThe spherical character of the nearshore samples was measured (Figure 5.1.15) and it was \n\npossible to observe that all samples presented ca. 50% of spherical grains with the exception of sample \n\nArmP_13m that presented a value of 35% of spherical quartz grains. Discoidal and sub-discoidal grains \n\npresented its higher percentage in sample ArmP_13m with 43% and its lower percentage in sample \n\nArmP_17.1m with 21%. All other samples presented values between 30% and 40%. Prismatic and sub-\n\nprismatic grains presented results of ca. 20% with exceptions of samples ArmP_16m, ArmP_18m and \n\nArmP_19m with values of 10%, 13% and 15% respectively.

In what concerns very angular and angular grains, dune samples show values \n\nunder 30% and beach samples above 50%; unit E presented about 40% (exception core LV10), nearshore \n\nsamples also presented values of ca. 40% and sample 14_(0.20-0.28) a value of 45%. Regarding spherical \n\ngrains it was observed that the highest percentage of these grains occurs in the nearshore samples (app. \n\n50%). In contrast, the lowest values were observed in sample 14_(0.20-0.28) with 15% and in beach \n\nsamples  (ca. 20%). Unit E exhibited values of 20%-30%, whereas dunes presented higher values, varying \n\nbetween 30 and 40%. \n\n   \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n108 \n \n\n5.1.4. Microtextural features \n\nMicrotextural features were analysed and quantified in samples from Lagoa dos Salgados. Figure \n\n5.1.16 exhibits SEM images of quartz grains from Lagoa dos Salgados different sedimentary environments \n\nand from Unit E. In Annex 2 an atlas of quartz grain microtextural features is presented. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.16 \u2013 SEM images of quartz grains from the Lagoa dos Salgados. A- Dune; B- Beach; C- Proximal nearshore; D- \nDistal nearshore; E- unit E, F- detail of percussion marks (approximately 12 microns in length) imprinted on the surface of a \n\ngrain from unit E. \n\n \n\n Figures 5.1.17 [samples from unit E and sample SG14_(0.20-0.28)], 5.1.18 (samples from dune \n\nand beach) and 5.1.19 (samples nearshore) and Table 5.1.3 (all samples) present the results obtained after \n\nmicrotextural classification of quartz grains collected in Lagoa dos Salgados. Furthermore, to verify grain-\n\nsize influence (all samples were analysed in the 1-3 ? fraction) two samples, one finer (i.e. SG20m) and \n\nanother coarser (i.e. SG20M) than the fraction analysed (SG20) were also classified to establish if size \n\nconditioned the features observed and their frequency. In fact, if we compare the three samples from core \n\nSG20 we conclude that angularity and fresh surfaces are substantially higher in the finer fraction, while \n\npercussion marks and dissolution are higher in the coarser fraction. The sample that presented more \n\nbalanced classificatory results was SG20 (i.e. 1-3 ? fraction) thus supporting the choice of grain size to \n\nanalyse. \n\n Sample SG14_(0.20-0.28) can be compared to all samples from unit E presenting higher angularity, \n\nfresh surfaces (with the exception of SG26), the lowest expression of dissolution features in this group of \n\nsamples and relevant presence of percussion marks [only comparable with SG14_(0.40-0.82)]. The two \n\nsamples from LV7 did not indicate any pattern or trend when comparing base and top of unit E. In fact, both \n\nsamples presented very similar values in all microtextural features with the only exception of adhering \n\nparticles (higher values for the sample collected at the base of unit E). On the other hand, samples from core \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n109 \n \n\nLV10 revealed some peculiarities. In this case, it was possible to observe a decreasing trend in terms of \n\nangularity and fresh surfaces towards the top, although the highest values were observed in sample \n\nLV10_(0.80-0.81) with 2.921 and 3.134, respectively. However it is important to stress that the variation \n\nbetween all samples from this core was minor, between 1.892 and 2.921. In what concerns dissolution and \n\nadhering particles a mirror image of the described above can be observed, with the lowest value (i.e. 1.600 \n\nand 1.815, respectively) observed in sample LV10_(0.80-0.81). A foggy decreasing upward trend can be \n\ndetected [with exception of sample LV10_(0.80-0.81)] in dissolution and adhering particles, as well as in  \n\npercussion marks. \n\nNo spatial trend is readily detectable, although percussion marks tend to decrease inland, whereas fresh \n\nsurfaces seem very slightly increase with distance from the coast (except sample SG20). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.17 \u2013 Microtextural results and their spatial distribution in fraction 1-3 ? of samples from unit E and 14_(0.20-0.28) \n\nfrom Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\n \n\n Beach and dune samples revealed differences in microtextural attribute (Figure 5.1.18). Dunes \n\npresented values of angularity between 2 and 3, with higher values for dune crests (i.e. Crista_Duna and \n\nDuna2_Crista) and for the more recent dune ridge (DunaF). In the dune samples, fresh surfaces exhibit \n\nvalues varying from 1.25 to 2, with the exception of the higher value (i.e. 2.5) of one dune crest (i.e. \n\nDuna2_Crista) and the lower value (i.e. 0.75) for sample Duna_2RR (farther inland). Dissolution values for \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n110 \n \n\nthe dune samples from Lagoa dos Salgados varied within the range 1.75 (i.e. Duna_R) and 3.3 (i.e. Duna). \n\nAs regards to adhering particles the dune samples showed a narrower range (between 3 and 3.5) with two \n\nexceptions presenting values of 2.66 and 2.63 (Duna_R and Duna_F, respectively). In what concerns, \n\npercussion marks classification in dune samples, it was possible to determine that the values attributed to \n\nthe samples varied between 1.0 (Duna2_Crista) and 2.36 (Duna_2F). In none of the microtextural features \n\nanalysed a clear pattern or trend emerged in terms of distribution of values. \n\nOn the other hand, beach samples exhibited angularity values >2.75 with the exception of sample \n\nPraia_TdV (i.e. 1.80). It is also interesting to note that the sample corresponding to the beach berm (i.e. \n\nBerma) presented a lower value (when compared with Face_Praia and Barra). In terms of fresh surfaces \n\nobserved in grains from the beach, the berm (i.e. Berma) presented the lower value (i.e. 2.0) whereas the \n\nother samples presented values above 2.6. In what regards dissolution features observed  in the beach \n\nsamples  they occur in  extremely low values, with the lowest value (0.33) observed in the beach face \n\nsample (i.e. Face_Praia) and the highest value (1.58) detected in the beach berm (i.e. Berma) sample. \n\nAdhering particles revealed the most striking difference between beach samples, with the berm (i.e. Berma) \n\npresenting a value of 2.41 whereas all the other samples exhibited values&lt;0.66. Percussion marks were \n\npresent especially in the beach face sample (i.e. Face_Praia) with a value of 2.75, while the other samples \n\npresented values within the interval 1.07-1.80. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.18 - \u2013 Microtextural results and their spatial distribution in samples from the dune and beach from Lagoa dos \nSalgados. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n111 \n \n\nNearshore samples can be divided in two groups: one composed of samples collected to the west \n\nof Lagoa dos Salgados inlet (identified with the ArmP acronym) and another group composed by samples \n\ncollected immediately to the south of Lagoa dos Salgados (identified with the SG acronym). It was possible \n\nto observe that, in both groups, trends and spatial patterns are present (Figure 5.1.19). For instance, \n\nangularity and fresh surfaces decrease with increasing distance from coastline and depth. For example, \n\nArmP samples range from 1.21 (i.e. ArmP_19m) to 3.0 (i.e. ArmP_11m) for angularity and from 0.21 to 1.81 \n\nfor fresh surfaces in the exact same samples. On the other hand, adhering particles increase with distance \n\nto coastline, varying from 2.45 (i.e. SG-6m sample) to 3.80 (i.e. SG-18m sample). Regarding dissolution \n\nmarks, a trend could only be recognized in one group of samples that presented decreasing values toward \n\nthe coastal fringe, values varying from 1.70 (i.e. SG-6m sample) to 3.93 (i.e. SG-18m sample). Percussion \n\nmarks did not present a clear spatial distribution, exhibiting values of 0.01 for sample SG-18m and values of \n\n2.0 for sample SG-9m and SG-18m. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.19 - \u2013 Microtextural results and their spatial distribution in the nearshore samples from Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n112 \n \n\n A summary characterization of microtextural features for every sedimentary environment studied, \n\nfor unit E (tsunami samples) and for sample SG14_(0.20-0.28) (possible storm?) reveals that: \n\n- Beach grains presented the highest values for fresh surfaces and strong presence of \n\npercussion marks. Dissolution and adhering particles are almost absent. \n\n- Dune grains revealed a well balance representation of all the microtextural features. \n\n- Nearshore samples presented high values of dissolution and adhering particles and moderate \n\npresence of percussion marks and fresh surfaces. \n\n- Storm grains present many similarities with beach samples and unit E samples and can only \n\nbe differentiated by the lower value of adhering particles. \n\n- Tsunami-deposited grains (Unit E) presented the highest values of percussion marks and fresh \n\nsurfaces (thus suggesting strong hydrodynamic processes before deposition). Tsunami grains \n\ncan also be characterized by presenting the widest range of values observed in all the \n\nmicrotextural features. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1.3 - Microtextural results obtained with the Lagoa dos Salgados samples. \n\nSample Depth (m) Sed.

Heavy mineral features \n\nThe heavy minerals assemblage was analysed in samples from the same environments as \n\ndescribed above (Table 5.1.4). Samples from unit E and SG14_(0.20-0.28) revealed a percentage of heavy \n\nminerals in total sediment ranging from 0.25% to 0.45% with the exception of sample SG26 and LV7_(0.40-\n\n0.41) with extremely low values of 0.015% and 0.043% respectively. By contrast beach samples present a \n\npercentage of heavy minerals below 0.2% while dune samples present values around 0.25% with the \n\nexception of samples Duna2_Crista (0.075%), A_Duna (0.106%), Duna_2F (0.101%) and Duna_R (0.426). \n\nFurthermore, the nearshore samples present extremely low values of&lt;0.092% of heavy minerals in total \n\nsediment. \n\nFigure 5.1.20 and Table 5.1.5 exhibit the heavy mineral composition of samples from unit E and \n\nsample SG14_(0.20-0.28). These samples (as all collected in Lagoa dos Salgados) present mainly three \n\ndifferent minerals (i.e. andalusite, staurolite and tourmaline) that typically correspond to ca. 85-90% of the \n\nheavy mineral population of the samples. Furthermore, other minerals were also identified from which \n\namphiboles stand out with percentage that reached almost 6%. \n\nUnit E heavy mineral assemblage did not revealed a clear horizontal or upward trend although in \n\ncores LV7 and LV10 the base of the deposit presents the lowest value (in each core) for andalusite and the \n\nhighest for tourmaline. Values for these minerals varied between 23.1%-47.1% (andalusite) and 35.6%-\n\n58.95% (tourmaline). In what concerns amphiboles and other minerals (e.g. zircon; garnet, sphene, \n\nsilimanite, epidote, pyroxene, rutile and brookite) percentages values, these were very low. In the case of \n\namphiboles results were<1.1% [except sample LV10_(0.80-0.81) with 1.31%] and in the case of other \n\nminerals the sample presented the highest result with 4.6% while the other samples exhibited values&lt;3.0%. \n\nSample SG14_(0.20-0.28) was differentiated from samples from unit E by the higher percentage of \n\nstaurolite (i.e. 24%) while in unit E samples varied from 13.2%-19.1%. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n115 \n \n\nTable 5.1.4 - Percentage of heavy minerals in total sediment in samples from Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\nSample Depth (m) Sedimentary Environment % of Heavy minerals in total sediment \n\n14 0.20_0.28 Storm (?) 0.248 \n\n14 0.40_0.82 Unit E 0.393 \n\n20 - Unit E 0.251 \n\n26 - Unit E 0.015 \n\nLV10 0.46-0.47 Unit E 0.319 \n\nLV10 0.56-0.57 Unit E 0.291 \n\nLV10 0.64-0.65 Unit E 0.335 \n\nLV10 0.80-0.81 Unit E 0.403 \n\nLV10 0.91-0.92 Unit E 0.451 \n\nLV7 0.40-0.41 Unit E 0.043 \n\nLV7 0.45-0.46 Unit E 0.357 \n\nPraia_TdV Sup.

Moreover, these samples exhibited values \n\nof staurolite of ca. 3.0% with the exception of the beach berm sample (i.e. Berma) that showed a value of \n\n9.18%. The highest percentage value for tourmaline was observed in sample Face_Praia with a value of \n\n67.2% while the lowest value was observed in sample Berma with 50%. Amphiboles were vestigial (i.e. \n\n0.001%) with the exception of sample Berma with 2.0%. In the beach samples collected in Lagoa dos \n\nSalgados it was also possible to observe other minerals that summed percentages variying from 1.7% (i.e. \n\nFace_Praia) to 8.5% (i.e. Praia_TdV). \n\nRegarding dune samples (Figure 5.1.21 and Table 5.1.5), no spatial trend could be established \n\nbased in the heavy mineral composition. These samples presented values within the range 25.7%-41.8% of \n\nandalusite, of 6.79%-13.8% of staurolite and 46.7%-60.0% of tourmaline. The highest percentage (i.e. \n\n2.85%) of amphiboles was observed in sample Duna_2F while the lowest value (i.e. 0.001%) was detected \n\nin samples Crista_Duna and Duna2_RR. The content in other minerals presented its lowest value (i.e. \n\n0.011%) in the dune crest samples (i.e. Crista_Duna and Duna2_Crista) and the highest value of 6.18% in \n\nsample A_Duna. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n117 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.21 - Heavy minerals results and their spatial distribution in dune and beach samples from Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1.22 - Heavy minerals results and their spatial distribution in nearshore samplesfrom Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n118 \n \n\nNearshore samples also did not allow the establishment of any distinguishable spatial pattern \n\n(Figure 5.1.22 and Table 5.1.5). In nearshore samples andalusite varied between 38.68% (i.e. SG-9m) and \n\n27.58% (i.e. SG-18m), while ataurolite ranged from 1.46% to 7.69% (i.e. SG-9m and SG-15m, respectively). \n\nOn the other hand, the highest value for tourmaline was observed in sample SG-15m with a value of 58.9% \n\nwhile the lowest value was detected in SG-18m with 49.4%. Nearshore samples present higher values for \n\namphiboles (up to 5.7%) and for other minerals (up to 10.35%). \n\nComparison of heavy mineral assemblages from different sedimentary environments and \n\nlithostratigraphic units suggests that unit E samples present similar percentage values of heavy mineral \n\nassemblage as dune samples (i.e. andalusite, tourmaline, amphiboles and other minerals). Furthermore, the \n\nonly exception is staurolite that presents its higher values (between 13.2% and 19.1% in samples from unit E \n\nand its highest value (i.e. 24.0%) in sample SG14_(0.20-0.28). Staurolite in dune samples varies from 6.79% \n\nto 13.8%. Beach samples were distinguishable by the higher percentage of other minerals and by the lowest \n\npercentage of staurolite. On the other hand, nearshore samples were differentiated by the higher content in \n\namphiboles and other minerals. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n119 \n \n\nTable 5.1.5 - Heavy mineral composition in samples from Lagoa dos Salgados. \n\nSample Depth (m) % Andalusite \n% \n\nStaurolite \n% Tourmaline % Amphiboles % Others \n\n14 0.20_0.28 27.429 24.000 46.286 0.001 2.295 \n\n14 0.40_0.82 31.304 19.130 49.565 0.001 0.011 \n\n20 - 47.126 16.092 35.632 0.001 1.159 \n\n26 - 30.769 18.343 47.929 0.001 2.968 \n\nLV10 0.46-0.47 31.111 16.296 49.630 0.741 2.230 \n\nLV10 0.56-0.57 35.156 13.281 49.219 0.781 1.572 \n\nLV10 0.64-0.65 25.658 15.132 57.895 0.001 1.326 \n\nLV10 0.80-0.81 30.921 15.132 48.026 1.316 4.613 \n\nLV10 0.91-0.92 23.134 17.164 58.955 0.746 0.011 \n\nLV7 0.40-0.41 34.826 16.915 47.761 0.498 0.011 \n\nLV7 0.45-0.46 27.933 15.642 54.190 1.117 1.127 \n\nPraia_TdV Sup. 38.415 2.439 50.610 0.001 8.545 \n\nFace_Praia Sup. 27.586 3.448 67.241 0.001 1.734 \n\nBarra Sup. 27.419 3.226 62.903 0.001 6.459 \n\nBerma Sup. 36.735 9.184 50.000 2.041 2.050 \n\nCrista_Duna Sup. 36.667 12.222 51.111 0.001 0.011 \n\nDuna2_Crista Sup. 31.818 13.636 52.273 2.273 0.011 \n\nA_Duna Sup. 26.543 6.790 59.877 0.617 6.181 \n\nDuna_R Sup. 31.915 13.830 50.000 2.128 2.137 \n\nDuna_2RR Sup. 27.536 8.696 63.043 0.001 0.735 \n\nDuna Sup. 41.803 7.377 46.721 1.639 2.468 \n\nDuna_F Sup. 31.288 7.975 57.055 1.227 2.462 \n\nDuna_2F Sup. 25.714 9.524 60.000 2.857 1.914 \n\nSG-6m Sup. 29.193 6.832 52.174 2.484 9.322 \n\nSG-9m Sup. 38.686 1.460 56.934 0.730 2.198 \n\nSG-13_5m Sup. 29.530 5.369 58.389 1.342 5.376 \n\nSG-15m Sup. 33.333 7.692 58.974 0.001 0.011 \n\nSG-18_5m Sup. 36.170 6.383 51.773 1.418 4.262 \n\nSG-18m Sup. 27.586 5.747 49.425 5.747 10.352 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n120 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n121 \n \n\n5.2. Boca do Rio \n\n5.2.1. Lithostratigraphic features \n\nBoca do Rio sediment infilling has been studied by several authors (e.g. Dawson et al., 1995; \n\nHindson et al., 1996; Hindson and Andrade, 1999; Oliveira et al., 2009; Cunha et al., 2010), which described \n\na sandy deposit associated with the AD 1755 tsunami inundation sandwiched within estuarine mud. The top \n\nmeter of the lithostratigraphy of the present-day alluvial plain has been described by other (see references \n\nabove) and can be summarized by Figure 5.2.1. The uppermost layer of the sedimentary sequence consists \n\nof dark red/brown silty clay with an almost constant thickness of 0.80 - 1m. The underlying layer has been \n\nassociated with the AD 1755 tsunami and has only been found within the main valley and the north-eastern \n\n(Ribeira de Vale Bar\u00e3o) tributary (Figure 5.2.2). It is present in the stratigraphic column up to ca.1500m from \n\nthe coastline. The thickness of this sandy unit decreases from ca. 0.50m in the coastal edge of the alluvial \n\nplain to a few centimetres in the area where the tributary streams merge into the alluvial field. This unit \n\npresents a strong lateral variability and is sedimentologically complex. Five sedimentologically distinct sub-\n\nunits were recognised by Hindson and Andrade (1999) within this unit in the seaward area of the lowland. \n\nThese sub-units presented a distinguishable character varying from silty fine sand to clean marine sand, a \n\ndark brown layer, or a chaotic layer that also included boulders (in the southern sector of the alluvial plain). \n\nHowever, the sub-units were not consistently present throughout the alluvial plain and lateral variations in \n\ntheir appearance where frequent at short distances. Further inland, Hindson and Andrade (1999) state that \n\nthe deposit is simpler and is reduced to a thin shelly sand layer before tapering out. The lower contact is \n\nclearly erosive and the upper contact with overlying unit is gradational, and in places difficult to establish. \n\nThe altitude of the basal contact of the tsunamigenic unit rises gradually inland from ca. 1.0 to 1.6m. The \n\nlayer underlying it is very similar to the topmost unit, consisting of the same brown mud with occasional \n\norganic material and charcoal. In some locations, the brown mud grades downwards into a black organic \n\nmud. The thickness of this unit varies between 0.5 and 1m. The base of this stratigraphic sequence consists \n\nof grey, marine sands with shells extending beyond a depth of 5m below ground surface without reaching \n\nthe base. \n\nSamples from tsunami sediment and present day analogues were collected in this area and used in \n\nthis work (Figure 5.2.3). Three tsunami samples (SAO, SAM and SS3 \u2013 corresponding to a profile inland) \n\nwere cored from the alluvial plain and crossing through the tsunamigenic unit, were studied. Furthermore, \n\neleven other sediment samples (five nearshore, three dune, one beach and two alluvial) were also retrieved \n\nand utilized in this work to characterize present day sedimentary environments. The nearshore samples \n\ncorrespond to a profile from -20m below msl up to -5m below msl. The dune samples consist of aeolian \n\nmaterial predating the AD 1755 event and preserved in karst hollows (P6 and P8) in the downwind slope of \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n122 \n \n\nthe rock spur barring the lowland and one (pedogenised) sample of dune sand topping the spur crest, \n\ninterpreted as the remnant of a climbing dune (Duna_Trep). \n\nThe chronology for the lithostratigraphy of Boca do Rio has been intensely debated (see references \n\nabove). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.1 \u2013 Lithostratigraphic and macroscopic log description of sample-core SAO that roughly corresponds to the \nschematic lithostratigraphy of the alluvial plain topmost meter. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.2 \u2013 Photographs of sampling in one trench within the alluvial plain of Boca do Rio.

Textural features \n\nGrain-size parameters obtained for the group of samples used in this study are summarized in Table \n\n5.2.1. With these results it is possible to recognise a decreasing inland trend for the 1%? and the 10% ? in \n\nthe tsunami samples. The standard deviation decrease inland while the remaining parameters did not \n\nrevealed a clear trend. The beach sample (i.e. Face) presented a mean grain size of 1.66 ?. The P6 and P8 \n\ndune samples presented many similarities in all textural aspects analysed while the dune sample Duna_Trep \n\nalthough sharing many resemblances, presented a slightly coarser overall grain-size. Within the nearshore \n\nsamples one sample stands out (-10m) due to its remarkably coarser nature, its large standard variation (i.e. \n\n1.60) and abrupt increase in size characterizing the 1 and 10 centiles; this is interpreted as resulting from \n\nbias introduced by a small number of large particles in an otherwise Gaussian size-distribution. The standard \n\ndeviation in other samples remains under 0.55 ? with the exception of the alluvial sediment. All the other \n\nnearshore samples presented mean values of approximately 1.75? (sample -10m presented a mean grain \n\nsize value of 0.93?) and kurtosis between 1.11 and 1.21. The more heterometric sample is the alluvial \n\nsample (i.e. Alv_Dirt) presenting the lowest 90% and the highest 1% ? with obvious consequences in the \n\nstandard deviation value, by far the highest value observed (i.e. 2.83). Textural data allowed the clear \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n124 \n \n\ndistinction of two samples (i.e. -10m and Alv_Dirt) among the ones analysed. The other entire group of \n\nsamples share many of the aspects analysed and presented similar values that decreased the differentiation \n\ncapacity solely based in the textural proxy. \n\n \n\nTable 5.2.1 - Summary of textural attributes of samples collected in Boca do Rio. \n\nSample Sed.

In \n\ncompositional terms no major contrast was registered from the base to the top of the sand in the thin \n\nsection.  Quartz was present throughout the thin section in percentage around 75-90%, Calcite was also \n\ncommon (app. 10%), Mica was detected in low percentage but many shell fragments (up to 15 %) where \n\nidentified in the thin section. Rounded mud clasts show out distinctively in the thin section and one of the \n\nmajor changes observed was the presence of rip-up clasts solely on the basal 4 cm of the unit.  Other major \n\nchange observed was related with the size of mud clasts and grains (smaller to the top of the unit), together \n\nwith the decrease of abundance in shell fragments towards the top; in addition, the compaction of the \n\nsediment is higher at the base of the deposit. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n126 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.5 - Image of a  7.5x4.5 cm thin section from the tsunamigenic layer and underlying mud (sample \nBDR_T2_97_105). \n\n \n\n5.2.3. Morphoscopy features \n\nMorphoscopic analyses were conducted in samples from Boca do Rio (Figure 5.2.6). In \n\ncompositional terms it was possible to verify that the nearshore samples (Figure 5.2.6A) presented a \n\npercentage of quartz grains in the range of 50% to 70% (i.e. samples -5m and -20m). In terms of the \n\npercentage of lithic material little variation was noted in the nearshore samples, which presented values of \n\nca. 25%. Bioclasts presence varied between 9.52% (-10m) and 27.72% (i.e. -12.5m). \n\nThe beach sample presented values of 44.79% for quartz grains, 31.25% for lithic material and \n\n23.96% for bioclasts. On the other hand, dune samples present the overall lowest value for lithic material \n\n(i.e. P6-15.50% and P8-18.81%) although these samples presented contrasting percentages for quartz \n\n(P6- 61.39%; P8- 42.20%) and bioclasts (P6- 19.80%; P8- 42.20%; respectively). The alluvial sample \n\npresented the following percentages: 63% for quartz grains; 25% for lithic material and 12% for bioclasts. \n\nThe tsunami samples (i.e. SAM and SAO) presented similar values for quartz but contrasting values for \n\nlithic material (higher in sample SAM - farther inland) and for bioclasts (higher in sample SAO \u2013 closest to \n\nthe coast line). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n127 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.6 - Morphoscopic compositional characteristics of samples from Boca do Rio.

In contrast the well-\n\nrounded and rounded grains were present in higher percentage in the samples farther away from the coast \n\n(i.e. 46.15% and 48.00% for samples -20m and -15m respectively). The high values observed for the \n\nproximal nearshore samples (i.e. -5m and -7.5m) were also observed in the beach sample (i.e. Face) with a \n\npercentage of 52.17% for very angular and angular grains. The dune samples presented a large \n\npredominance of well-rounded, rounded and sub-rounded grains with values of 68.00% for sample P6 and of \n\n65.00% for sample P8, respectively. On the other hand, tsunami samples show high values for very angular \n\nand angular grains (i.e. SAM-56.10 % and SAO-44.90%) with the higher values observed farther inland. \n\n The shape of quartz grains was also analysed in Boca do Rio (Figure 5.2.8). The nearshore \n\nsamples presented a decreasing trend towards the coast of spherical grains with values of 34.62 % for \n\nsample -20m and of 13.85% for sample -7.5m. Sample -5m presented a value of 25.86% in contrast with the \n\ntendency described above. The beach and dune samples showed values of ca. 25% of spherical grains. The \n\nalluvial samples exhibited a value of 30.77% for spherical grains and the highest value of all samples for \n\nprismatic grains (i.e. 23.08%). On the other hand, tsunami samples (i.e. SAM and SAO) revealed \n\npercentage of ca. 17% of spherical grains and ca. 55% for discoid and sub-discoid grains (sample SAM- \n\nfarther inland- with the higher value \u2013 58.14%). \n\n The morphoscopic results allowed the differentiation of sedimentary environments mainly based in \n\nthe roundness and sphericity characteristics of grains (i.e. well-rounded and rounded grains are more \n\npresent in the distal nearshore samples while more angular grains are present in the proximal, beach and \n\ntsunami samples). In terms of spatial variation of morphoscopic characteristics in the tsunami samples, the \n\nlow number of samples constrains interpretations but it is important to note an increase inland of lithic \n\nmaterial. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n129 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.8 - Sphericity classification of nearshore samples (A) and beach, dune, aluvial and tsunami samples (B) from \nBoca do Rio. \n\n \n\n5.2.4. Microtextural features \n\nThe microtextural results obtained for Boca do Rio are summarized in Figure 5.2.9 and Table 5.2.2. \n\nIn terms of angularity, all samples present values in the range between 2.2 and 2.5, except higher \n\nvalues yielded by beach and two proximal nearshore samples (3.000, 3.462 and 3.417, respectively) and \n\nlower values by two nearshore samples -15m and -20m ( 1.455 and 1.909, respectively) and one dune \n\nsample (Duna_Trep  - 1.667). On the other hand, fresh surfaces present highest values in nearshore \n\nsamples -5m and -7.5m (4.385 and 4.250, respectively); the beach sample exhibits a result of 2.700, while \n\ntsunami samples show results within the 1.920 to 2.800 range; the dunes present values of 1.524 and 1.560 \n\n(P6 and P8 respectively) while Duna_Trep (and all other remaining samples) show values under 1.15. In \n\nwhat concerns dissolution features, it was observed that samples with values &lt;1 are tsunami sample SS3 \n\nand proximal nearshore samples (-5m and -7.5m). Moreover, the other tsunami samples (SAM and SAO) \n\npresent values for dissolution of 1.500 and 1.520, respectively. The highest values registered for dissolution \n\nwere obtained in one nearshore (-10m) and two alluvial samples, with values above 3.5. Regarding adhering \n\nparticles, dunes showed results around 2, while tsunami and beach samples exhibited values between 1.100 \n\nand 1.560. Alluvial samples, Duna_Trep and all nearshore sediments (except -5m and -7.5) present results \n\nfor adhering particles above 3.0.

Moreover, dune samples show values \n\naround 1.250, except sample Duna_Trep with a value of 0.833.

Heavy mineral features \n\nHeavy mineral content in samples from Boca do Rio was analysed (Table 5.2.3). Tsunami samples \n\npresented values of 0.168% (i.e. SAM), 0.212% (i.e. SS3) and 0.070% (i.e. SAO) thus not allowing the \n\nestablishment of any spatial trend. The beach sample (i.e. Face) and the Duna_Trep sample presented \n\nvalues of ca. 0.35% and 0.38% (the highest observed), respectively. All the remaining samples (all \n\nnearshore samples and two dune samples \u2013 P6 and P8) presented much lower percentage (<0.07%) for \n\nheavy mineral fraction in total sediment. \n\nIn compositional terms all samples presented more than 75% of andalusite, staurolite and \n\ntourmaline with pyroxene and amphiboles also present (Figure 5.2.10 and Table 5.2.4). All nearshore \n\nsamples presented more than 25% of andalusite with the exception of sample -10m (i.e. 19.737%). Beach \n\nand dune samples presented results in the range 22% to 24%, except sample Duna_Trep with a result of \n\n31.21%. Tsunami samples exhibited values in the range of 22% to 28% while alluvial samples showed a \n\nresult of 19.12%. Staurolite results allowed a more clear differentiation due to the fact that all nearshore \n\nsamples presented values above 15%, alluvial sample has 22.794% while face and dune samples presented \n\nvalues of ca. 14.5% (except Duna_Trep with 17.197%). On the other hand tsunami samples revealed values \n\nwithin the range 10.156% and 15.172%. In the case of tourmaline spatial trends could be inferred: in the \n\nnearshore samples it is visible a decrease in the percentage of tourmaline with decreasing distance to the \n\ncoast while in the tsunami samples the percentage of tourmaline increases inland. In fact, all nearshore \n\nsamples exhibited results below 50% while beach and dunes (except Duna_Trep with 42%) displayed \n\nvalues around ca. 50% which are similar to the percentage obtained for tourmaline in tsunami samples. \n\n \n\nTable 5.2.3 - Percentage of heavy mineral composition in total sediment of samples from Boca do Rio. \n\nSample Depth (m) Sedimentary Environment \n% of Heavy minerals in \n\ntotal sediment \n\nSAM 1.04-1.17 Tsunami 0.168 \n\nSS3 - Tsunami 0.212 \n\nSAO 0.87-0.98 Tsunami 0.070 \n\nFace Sup Beach 0.350 \n\nDuna_Trep Sup Dune 0.378 \n\nP6 Sup Dune 0.036 \n\nP8 Sup Dune 0.053 \n\n-5m Sup Nearshore 0.010 \n\n-10m Sup Nearshore 0.026 \n\n-12_5m Sup Nearshore 0.053 \n\n-20m Sup Nearshore 0.068 \n\nAlv_Dirt Sup Alluvial 0.013 \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n133 \n \n\n Alluvial sample presented a value of 40.441% of tourmaline. In what regards pyroxene it was \n\nobserved that all nearshore samples presented results above 7% while beach and dune exhibited values in \n\nthe 4.45%-5.50% range. Tsunami samples seem to decrease its content in pyroxene inland with values \n\nvarying from 4.138% to 8.462%. Amphiboles are rare in nearshore samples and absent in beach sample. \n\nAmphiboles present its maximum value in the alluvial sample with a 3.676% presence. In what concerns \n\nother minerals (e.g. zircon, garnet, olivine, epidote, monazite, rutile and sphene), it can be observed that \n\ndune, beach and tsunami samples presented similar values (i.e. dune and beach ca. 3.5% while tsunami \n\nexhibited values in the range of 3.454% to 5.390%). Nearshore samples presented values below 1.761% \n\nexcept sample -5m that displayed a result of 3.156% for the presence of other minerals. Alluvial sample \n\nrevealed the highest value for the presence of other minerals with a result of 5.886%. \n\n As a summary, it can be perceived that tsunami samples share more similarities in terms of heavy \n\nmineral percentage compositional content (i.e. andalusite, staurolite, tourmaline and other minerals) with \n\ndune and beach samples than with any other group of samples (i.e nearshore or alluvial samples). Staurolite \n\napparently allowed the differentiation of environments except for sample Duna_Trep. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.10 \u2013 Heavy mineral composition of nearshore samples (A) and beach dune and tsunami sample (B) from Boca do \nRio. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n134 \n \n\nTable 5.2.4 - Results from heavy mineral assemblages in the Boca do Rio samples. \n\nSample % Andalusite % Staurolite % Tourmaline % Pyroxene % Amphibole % Others \n\nSAM 22.069 15.172 53.103 4.138 2.069 3.454 \n\nSS3 28.125 10.156 50.000 6.250 0.781 4.695 \n\nSAO 22.308 13.846 48.462 8.462 1.538 5.390 \n\nFace 22.581 14.516 54.839 4.839 0.001 3.235 \n\nDuna_Trep 31.210 17.197 42.675 4.459 0.637 3.828 \n\nP6 23.784 15.135 50.811 4.865 2.162 3.250 \n\nP8 22.000 14.000 52.500 5.500 2.500 3.505 \n\n-5m 31.496 24.409 22.047 16.535 2.362 3.156 \n\n-10m 19.737 28.947 38.816 12.500 0.001 0.010 \n\n-12_5m 28.205 19.872 44.231 7.051 0.001 0.650 \n\n-20m 26.901 16.374 45.614 8.772 0.585 1.761 \n\nAlv_Dirt 19.118 22.794 40.441 8.088 3.676 5.886 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n135 \n \n\n5.3. Voe of Scatsta \n\n5.3.1. Lithostratigraphic features \n\nIn the location of Voe of Scatsta, the erosion of peat by the sea exposed along the coast a cliffed \n\noutcrop of ca. 2m high. Within the lower part of that peat, there is an approximately 0.10m thick, wide-spread \n\nmassive sand layer, which overlies 0.30m of peat. The sand layer is more or less continuous for more than \n\n150m both alongshore and inland. Several cores were collected in this region and two of those cores SHT_1 \n\nand SHT_3, taken from the walls of trenches located less than 50m apart and aligned cross shore, were \n\nstudied in more detail (Figure 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). Two samples from each core were analysed; one \n\ncorrespondent to the base of the sandy deposit and a second sample (in each core) located above the \n\nprevious one and close to the top contact of the sand unit but still within it. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.1 \u2013 Location of cores obtained in Voe of Scatsta, Shetland Islands. \n\n \n\nBoth studied cores presented similar lithostratigraphies (Figure 5.3.3). The exposed trench walls \n\nrevealed a basal peat unit of ca. 0.30m. This unit is overlaid by a medium to coarse sand layer with an \n\nerosional contact at the base and an uncorformity at the top of the unit. Moreover, this unit also exhibited \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n136 \n \n\nsome centimetric pebbles and rare cobbles although it did not present very rich shell content. On top of this \n\nsandy unit, a peat layer, sharing many of the characteristics of the basal unit, is present. The top 0.10m are \n\ncomposed of dark brown soil with many roots and plant fragments. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.2 \u2013 Photo of the trench wall (left image) were sample SHT_1 was collected. Detail of the tsunamigenic unit (right \nimage; blue rectangle is app. 0. 10 m). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.3 \u2013 Lithostratigraphy of core SHT_1 retrieved in Voe of Scatsta. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n137 \n \n\nThe proposed chronology for this sandy layer and its association with a specific tsunamigenic event \n\nwill be discussed in the following chapter based in radiocarbon dates obtained by other authors (Bondevik et \n\nal., 2005; Dawson et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n5.3.2. Textural features \n\nGrain-size distribution and parameters were measured and the vertical and horizontal variation in \n\ntextural propertied were measured in all samples (Table 5.3.1). The coarse sediment consists of medium to \n\ncoarse, moderately sorted, quartziferous sand. Samples reveal contrasting behaviour in terms of vertical \n\ntrends for 1%?, 10% ?, 90% ?, mean, mode and median. While the sediment in core SHT_1 display a fining \n\nupward trend, core SHT_3 reveals a coarsening upward sequence, although the low number of samples \n\nconstrains further interpretations and extrapolations of these results. On the other hand, only kurtosis \n\nexhibits an identical pattern in both cores (SHT_1 and SHT_3), the values being higher at the base of the \n\nunit. \n\nIn terms of horizontal variation, the sample closest to the shoreline (SHT_1) is slightly coarser at the \n\nbase and also when averaging the mean values obtained for each sample pair, but the top sand in each \n\ncore shows an opposite trend. Standard deviations are almost identical in all samples. Thus, textural data \n\ndid not allow the establishment of any consistent trend of vertical or horizontal variation in grain size. \n\n \n\nTable 5.3.1 - Summary from the textural results obtained for samples collected in Voe of Scatsta. \n\nSample \nDept\n\nh (m) \n1% ? \n\n10% \n\n? \n\n90\n\n% ? \n\nMean \n\n(MZ) \n\n? \n\nGraphic \n\nStd \n\nDeviatio\n\nn (?1) \n\nGraphic \n\nKurtosis \n\n(KG) \n\nSimple \n\nSorting \n\nMeasure \n\n(SSM) \n\nMode \n\n? \n\nMedia\n\nn ? \n\nSHT_1 \n0.22-\n\n0.24 \n-0.83 -0.02 2.69 1.24 1.06 1.01 1.76 0.75 1.17 \n\nSHT_1 \n0.26-\n\n0.28 \n-1.51 -0.68 2.23 0.64 1.13 1.13 1.89 0.25 0.57 \n\nSHT_3 \n0.22-\n\n0.25 \n-1.15 -0.37 2.47 0.99 1.07 1.13 1.87 0.25 0.88 \n\nSHT_3 \n0.25-\n\n0.28 \n-0.97 -0.18 2.59 1.20 1.07 1.44 1.80 1.25 1.28 \n\n \n\nIn terms of micromorphological changes (Figure 5.3.4) the major changes observed were related with the \n\nsize of clasts and grains (consistently smaller towards the top of the unit), this trend being accompanied by \n\nthe decrease in abundance of plant fragments and by decrease in the voids (higher compaction of the \n\nsediment at the base of the deposit). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n138 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.4 \u2013 Image of a 7.5x4.5 cm thin section from sample SHT_3 (22-30). \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Morphoscopy features \n\nMorphoscopic characteristics were measured in samples from core SHT_1 and SHT_3. Results are \n\nsummarized in Figures 5.3.5, 5.3.6 and 5.3.7. In compositional terms it was possible to observe that a very \n\nhigh percentage of quartz was detected [i.e. from 50% in sample SHT_3_(23-25) up to 65% in sample \n\nSHT_1_(22-24)]. Moreover, one should take into account that (contrary to the cases of Lagoa dos Salgados \n\nand Boca do Rio) the bioclasts observed were essentially (>90%) plant fragments and not carbonate shells. \n\nSamples from core SHT_3 presented less bioclasts (ca. 10%) than samples from core SHT_1 (ca. 25%). \n\nMoreover, it was also possible to detect that the percentage of lithic material is higher at the base of the unit \n\nwhen compared with overlying samples (the difference between base and top varying between 6% and \n\n12%).  \n\nIn terms of roundness of the quartz grains observed (Figure 5.3.6) it was possible to observe that \n\nthe well-rounded and rounded grains are typically present in percentages around 60% to 65% and are more \n\nfrequent at the base of the sand in both cores. Very angular and angular grains are more frequent at the top \n\nsamples in each core, with values between 15% and 20%. \n\n Regarding shape (Figure 5.3.7), the results show that spherical grains were more frequently found \n\n(7% in SHT_1 and 3% in SHT_3) at the base of the sand unit, whereas more discoid grains showed more \n\nfrequently at the top. In terms of shape all samples presented values within a narrow range. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n139 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.5 \u2013 Morphoscopic compositional features of samples retrieved from Voe of Scatsta. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.6 \u2013 Roundness classification for quartz grains from samples collected in the Voe of Scatsta. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n140 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.7 - Shape classification for quartz grains from samples collected in the Voe of Scatsta. \n\n \n\n  As a summary, it can be said that morphoscopy was not totally conclusive in the \n\nestablishment of vertical or horizontal trends with the exception of the presence of more lithic material at the \n\nbase of the high-energy sandy deposit and more angular grains at the top. \n\n \n\n5.3.4. Microtextural features \n\nThe vertical variation in microtextural features was assessed in tsunamigenic sediment from the \n\nVoe of Scatsta (Figure 5.3.8 and Table 5.3.2). It was possible to detect that angularity increases towards the \n\ntop, particularly in core SHT_3. In terms of fresh surfaces the samples studied displayed values in the range \n\n2.0 [SHT_1_(22-24)] to 3.3 [i.e. SHT_3_(22-25)]. Dissolution features are higher at the base than at the top \n\nof the tsunamigenic unit in both cores (1.2 to 3.3 in core SHT_1 and 1.8 to 2.5; top and base respectively). \n\nRegarding adhering particles the values obtained were very high in sample SHT_1_(22-24, with 4.4) while \n\nthe other samples yielded results in the range of 1.4 to 1.1 for adhering particles. On the other hand, results \n\nobtained for percussion marks results were similar within each core but contrasting between core SHT_1 \n\nand SHT_3, with the latter presenting significantly lower values. \n\nThe microtextural analysis of the four samples retrieved from the Voe of Scatsta shows that these proxies \n\nare to some extent useful to highlight vertical variation of features within the tsunamigenic unit. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n141 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.8 - Microtextural features results and spatial distribution in samples retrieved from the Voe of Scatsta. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5.3.2 - Summary of microtextural results obtained in samples from Voe of Scatsta. \n\nSample \nDepth \n\n(m) \n\nNumber \n\nof grains \nAngularity \n\nFresh \n\nsurfaces \nDissolution \n\nAdhering \n\nparticles \n\nPercussion \n\nmarks \n\nSHT_1 0.22-0.24 12 3.217 2.000 1.217 4.435 0.174 \n\nSHT_1 0.26-0.28 12 3.167 2.667 3.250 2.083 0.010 \n\nSHT_3 0.22-0.25 16 2.875 3.313 1.813 1.438 0.813 \n\nSHT_3 0.25-0.28 15 1.867 2.733 2.533 2.200 0.800 \n\n \n\n5.3.5. Heavy mineral features \n\nHeavy mineral assemblage was studied in four samples from cores SHT_1 and SHT_3. In terms of \n\nthe percentage of heavy minerals in total sediment it was possible to differentiate the two cores SHT_1 \n\n(values of 0.52% to 0.59%) and SHT_3 (values of 0.826% and 0.827%- virtually identical) (Table 5.3.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n142 \n \n\nTable 5.3.3 - Percentage of heavy mineral content in total sediment of samples from Voe of Scatsta. \n\nSample Depth (m) % of Heavy minerals in total sediment \n\nSHT_1 0.22-0.24 0.527 \n\nSHT_1 0.26-0.28 0.585 \n\nSHT_3 0.22-0.25 0.826 \n\nSHT_3 0.25-0.28 0.827 \n\n \n\n The heavy mineral assemblages of samples from cores SHT_1 and cores SHT_3 are strongly \n\ndominated by amphiboles with a presence of more than 88.95% (Figure 5.3.9 and Table 5.3.4). This mineral \n\nis also more frequent at the basal samples in each core. By contrast, andalusite exhibited smaller results for \n\nthe basal samples (3.302% and 2.941%, for SHT_1 and SHT_3, respectively) when compared with overlying \n\nsamples (5.233% and 5.128%, for SHT_1 and SHT_3, respectively). Pyroxene and garnet did not \n\ndemonstrate any clear vertical trend and showed very low values of less than 1.80%. Other minerals (e.g. \n\nzircon, silimanite and staurolite) revealed presence of around 2.3% with the exception of sample \n\nSHT_3_(25-28) with 1.291%. \n\n Heavy mineral assemblages contributed to the establishment of vertical trends within the sandy \n\ndeposit, although the low number of samples might constrain generalizations. \n\n \n\nTable 5.3.4 - Heavy mineral assemblages in sand samples of Voe of Scatsta. \n\nSample Depth (m) % Andalusite % Pyroxene % Amphibole % Garnet % Others \n\nSHT_1 0.22-0.24 5.233 1.744 88.953 1.744 2.361 \n\nSHT_1 0.26-0.28 3.302 1.415 92.453 0.472 2.366 \n\nSHT_3 0.22-0.25 5.128 1.282 91.667 0.641 2.334 \n\nSHT_3 0.25-0.28 2.941 0.588 92.941 1.176 1.291 \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n143 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3.9 - Heavy mineral composition of tsunamigenic samples collected in Voe of Scatsta. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n144 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n145 \n \n\n5.4. Lhok Nga \n\n5.4.1. Lithostratigraphic features \n\nSamples used in this study were collected a few weeks after the tsunami event of 26 December \n\n2004. Figure 5.4.1 illustrates the spatial distribution of the samples retrieved: two samples from present-day \n\nanalogues (i.e. nearshore and beach) and four locations corresponding to a sampling profile inland (NGA_2, \n\nNGA_7, NGA_9 and NGA_18). It is important to note that locations NGA_2 and NGA_7 yielded more than \n\none sample of the tsunamigenic sediment and were collected to assess vertical variations within it. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4.1 - Location maps of the Lhok Nga Bay and collected samples (Paris et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nThe 2004 tsunami deposits in this area consist of medium to coarse, greyish to yellowish sands, \n\nwhich display lateral variations in thickness and grain-size and vertical variations in texture. The deposits \n\nsettled on top of brown sandy soils, dune sands or beachrock near the coast, reddish fluvial sands in the \n\nrivers, and dark brown silty soil in the rice paddies (Paris et al., 2007). The lower contact of the tsunami unit \n\nis abrupt or erosional when in contact with underlying sand. The thickness of the tsunami deposits \n\ndecreases landward. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n146 \n \n\nIn Lhok Nga, the tsunami deposit displayed stratification into distinct layers in some sampling \n\nlocations, and in cases up to 15 layers could be distinguished in the field. Typically, the basal layers are \n\ncoarser and massive and separated by thin mud lines (in cross section) from the upper part that is usually \n\nfiner. A landward increasing content of rip-up clasts of the locally underlying soil, roots, wood, leaves and \n\nanthropic clasts (glass, brick, metal, plastic, etc.) was detected. \n\nIn some trenches the topmost layer was considered as the backwash deposit, when it is coarser than the \n\nlower normally-graded couplet of layers (e.g. NGA_2G and NGA_7F). \n\nThe schematic lithostratigraphy (including all the samples used in this study) is described in Figure \n\n5.4.2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4.2 - Sequence stratigraphy and interpretation of the vertical trends along the Lhok Nga transect (Paris et al., \n2007). \n\n \n\n5.4.2. Textural features \n\nBased in the mean grain size (Table 5.4.1), all samples are within the medium to coarse sand \n\ninterval (except NGA_18). Furthermore, using samples NGA_2A, NGA_7C, NGA_9A and NGA_18 is \n\npossible to establish a decreasing inland grain-size trend. For the same samples it can also be observed \n\nthat NGA_18 (farther inland) presents the smaller mean grain size 2.10 ?. \n\nThe backwash samples NGA_2G and NGA_7F exhibit an opposite trend with finer material \n\n(NGA_2G = 0.78 ?; NGA_7F = 0.42 ?) closer to the coast.  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n147 \n \n\nTable 5.4.1 - Mean grain size of samples retrieved from Lhok Nga (data provided by R.

Morphoscopy features \n\nMorphoscopic analysis was conducted in samples from Lhok Nga and results are shown as figures \n\nto visualize spatial distribution (Figure 5.4.3, 5.4.4 and 5.4.5). \n\nIn compositional terms (Figure 5.4.3), samples from Lhok Nga, reveal quartz content in the range of \n\n35% to 45%, except samples NGA_2G with the higher value of 50.0% and NGA_7F with the lower value of \n\n28.1%; interestingly both samples represent backwash sediment. Regarding lithic material, the values are \n\nconsistently within the 15%-20% range, except for samples NGA_7C and NGA_18 with 8.57% and 11.61% \n\nrespectively. The carbonate bioclasts are present typically in percentage of ca. 45% with two exceptions, \n\nboth backwash samples, presenting contrasting values (55.2% for sample NGA_7F and 33.7% for sample \n\nNGA_2G, respectively the highest and the lowest values observed). \n\nQuartz grains from samples studied were classified in terms of roundness (Figure 5.4.3) and \n\nsphericity (Figure 5.4.4). Sediment deposited by backwash presented the higher values of well-rounded and \n\nrounded grains (11% and 37%, respectively NGA_2G and NGA_7F) whereas all other samples presented \n\nresults of less than 9%. In terms of very angular and angular grains the highest values were observed in \n\nsand at the base of trench 2 (NGA_2A), 9 (NGA_9A) and 18 (NGA_18) with values of 83.3%, 78.4% and \n\n87.2% respectively. On the other hand spherical grains represent less than 6% in all samples, except the \n\nbackwash sediment (NGA_2G and NGA_7F) with 10.9% and 20.0%, respectively. The grains also revealed \n\na well-balanced distribution between prismatic and discoid shapes. \n\nAs a summary it can be concluded that morphoscopic results slightly contributed to the \n\ndifferentiation of samples of the base of the tsunamigenic unit (roundness characteristics) and of the \n\nbackwash (percentage of bioclasts and sphericity characteristics). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n148 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4.3 - Morphoscopic compositional features of samples retrieved from Lhok Nga. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4.4 - Roundness classification for quartz grains from samples collected in Lhok Nga. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n149 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4.5 - Shape classification for quartz grains from samples collected in Lhok Nga. \n\n \n\n5.4.4. Microtextural features \n\nMicrotextural features were observed and classified in samples from Lhok Nga. Regarding \n\nangularity, the samples present higher values inland (e.g. NGA_9A=4.00) but no consistent spatial trend \n\ncould be established. Samples from trench NGA_2 exhibit increasing values towards the top of the \n\ntsunamigenic unit but the same pattern is not present in trench NGA_7. In terms of fresh surfaces, it was \n\nobserved that all samples displayed results &lt;3, except in the case of backwash sediment (NGA_2G, with a \n\nresult of 3.571 and NGA_7F with a result of 3.429) and sample NGA_7C with a result of 3.276. In trenches \n\nNGA_2 and NGA_7 it was observed that fresh surfaces increase towards the top of the tsunamigenic unit. \n\nValues of dissolution features are extremely low (i.e.&lt;1.6) in all cases, except for samples NGA_18 and \n\nNGA_nearshore (the latter presenting the highest value). In what respects adhering particles it was \n\nobserved that the highest values (above 4.3) were noticed in the nearshore and beach sample with the lower \n\nvalues being obtained in the NGA_2A and NGA_2F samples (1.938 and 1.357, respectively). Percussion \n\nmarks increase to the top in trenches NGA_2 and NGA_7, and the highest value was observed in sample \n\nNGA_7F (backwash, result of 1.643), while the lowest value was yielded by sample NGA_18 (0.010). \n\nMicrotextural results solely reveal vertical variations within the tsunamigenic unit in fresh surfaces and \n\npercussion marks (increasing to the top) and that the highest values were identified in the sediment \n\ndeposited by backwash. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n150 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4.6 - Spatial distribution of microtextural results in sediments retrieved from Lhok Nga. \n\n \n\nTable 5.4.2 - Summary of microtextural results obtained in samples from Lhok Nga. \n\nSample Depth Sed.

In what concerns andalusite, it was observed that the highest \n\nresults were observed in the sample closest to the coastline (i.e. NGA_2A) and in the sample farther inland \n\n(i.e. NGA_18) with 35.294% and 38.750%, respectively. The minimum value observed in percentage of \n\nandalusite was in sample NGA_7C. Regarding pyroxene, presented its higher values in samples NGA_2A \n\n(i.e. 7.843%) and NGA_18 (i.e. 2.500%) while its lower results were registered in samples NGA_7C (i.e. \n\n0.610%) and NGA_9A (i.e. 0.962%).

Stoneybridge \n\n5.5.1. Lithostratigraphic features \n\nA tempestite sandy deposit retrieved immediately after the Great Storm of the 11th of January of \n\n2005 was used in this research. The storm damage was particularly felt by the south-facing coastal areas in \n\nSouth Uist and Benbecula (Hebrides Islands) which experienced the severest storm wave activity during this \n\nJanuary 2005 storm. Near Stoneybridge (Figure 5.5.1), a beach ridge was breached by the waves, resulting \n\nin widespread flooding inland together with the deposition of fans of gravel and sand some of which are up \n\nto 35 cm in thickness (Angus and Rennie, 2007). This discontinuous (medium to fine sand) unit, with varying \n\nthickness, was recognised up to 150m landward of the coastal dunes and are draped over the machair. \n\nIn the core used in this study (Figure 5.5.2) a 0.10m thick sand layer was recovered and four \n\nsamples (at different depth in that core) were used in all sedimentological analyses that are presented \n\nbelow. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5.1 - \u2013 Location of samples obtained in Stoneybridge, Hebrides Islands \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n154 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5.2 - Image of the sandy storm deposit retrieved from Stoneybridge. \n\n \n\n5.5.2. Textural features \n\nGrain-size parameters were measured in the four samples collected in Stoneybridge (Table 5.5.1). \n\nThe samples are all composed of fine sand and the mean grain-size is  of ca. 2.45 ?, except sample \n\nHB_(0.05-0.06) that is slightly coarser (2.1 ?). The standard deviation is similar in all samples with the \n\nlowest value of 0.36 ? in the top sample and the highest value of 0.58 ? in sample HB_(0.05-0.06). Kurtosis \n\nrevealed decreases towards the top of the unit. It was also noticed that base and top of the tempestite \n\npresent identical median values. \n\n \n\nTable 5.5.1 - Summary of textural characteristics of samples retrieved from Stoneybridge. \n\nSample Depth (m) \n1% \n\n? \n\n10% \n\n? \n\n90% \n\n? \n\nMean \n\n(MZ) ? \n\nGraphic \n\nStd \n\nDeviation \n\n(?1) \n\nGraphic \n\nKurtosis \n\n(KG) \n\nSimple \n\nSorting \n\nMeasure \n\n(SSM) \n\nMode \n\n? \n\nMedian \n\n? \n\nHB 0.02-0.03 1.29 2.02 2.91 2.49 0.36 1.09 0.62 2.75 2.51 \n\nHB 0.05-0.06 0.54 1.23 2.73 2.08 0.58 1.01 0.95 2.25 2.18 \n\nHB 0.07-0.08 0.89 1.80 2.92 2.44 0.44 1.18 0.78 2.75 2.48 \n\nHB 0.09-0.10 0.77 1.72 2.99 2.46 0.52 1.28 0.95 2.75 2.51 \n\n \n\n5.5.3. Morphoscopy features \n\nMorphoscopic characteristics were observed in four samples from the tempestites retrieved from \n\nStoneybridge (Figure 5.5.3, 5.5.4, 5.5.5 and 5.5.6). The samples are dominated by variable but generally \n\nhigh abundance of bioclasts, around 45% (mainly dominated by plant fragments but also with infrequent \n\nshell material). The top presented 60% of bioclasts wheareas the base yielded 70% of bioclasts. On the \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n155 \n \n\nother hand, quartz occurs in proportions of ca. 30%, except in the base of the unit with 15%. All samples \n\npresent low percentage of lithic materials (app. 20%) although the base of the unit displayed 7% and the top \n\n14% in lithics. Figure 5.5.4 shows the roundness classification of grains from the storm deposit. The samples \n\nyielded low values for well-rounded and rounded grains, with 23.5% at the base and less than 6.7% in every \n\nother case. In what concerns very angular and angular grains they are especially abundant in samples \n\nHB_(0.05-0.06) and HB_(0.07-0.08) with 72% and 75%, the remaining samples exhibiting values above \n\n53%. Figure 5.5.5 displays the sphericity results obtained for the same group of samples. It is possible to \n\nobserve that spherical samples are rare (less than 10% of grains) in two samples, HB_(0.05-0.06) and \n\nHB_(0.09-0.10),  this type of shape being  absent in all  remaining samples. The grains from the storm \n\ndeposit are typically discoid or sub-discoid, occurring from base to top in percentages of 68%, 68%, 60% \n\nand 63%. \n\nIn the case of the tempestite retrieved from the Hebrides no vertical trend was recognized solely \n\nbased in this proxy. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5.3 - Morphoscopic compositional features of samples retrieved from Stoneybridge. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n156 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5.4 - Roundness classification for quartz grains from samples collected in Stoneybridge. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5.5 - Shape classification for quartz grains from samples collected in Stoneybridge. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n157 \n \n\n5.5.4. Microtextural features \n\nMicrotextural classification was conducted in samples from the storm deposit that was collected in \n\nStoneybridge (Figure 5.5.6 and Table 5.5.2). Angularity exhibited high values (ca. 3.143 to 3.643) except the \n\nbase of the unit that displayed a result of 2.212. In terms of fresh surfaces the highest values were observed \n\nin samples HB_(0.05-0.06) and HB_(0.07-0.08) with results of 2.500 and 2.000 respectively while the fewer \n\nfresh surfaces were measured in the basal sample. On the other hand, dissolution presented very high \n\nvalues (highest at the top and base of tempestite) and the lowest of 3.000 for sample HB_(0.07-0.08). \n\nRegarding adhering particles they present values of ca. 3.5 in the middle samples while the top and base of \n\nthe deposit revealed values around 4.5. In what concerns, percussion marks the highest values of 0.643 was \n\ndetected in sample HB_(0.05-0.06) while the lowest result of 0.083 was observed in sample HB_(0.07-0.08). \n\n Microtextural data was not advantageous in establishing a vertical trend for the tempestite although \n\nit was clear that the base and top of the deposit exhibited contrasting results with the other tempestite \n\nsamples (except for percussion marks). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5.6 - Microtextural features results and their distribution across the storm layer retrieved in Stoneybridge. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n158 \n \n\n \n\nTable 5.5.2 - Summary of microtextural results obtained in samples from Stoneybridge. \n\nSample Depth (m) \nNumber \n\nof grains \nAngularity \n\nFresh \n\nsurfaces \nDissolution \n\nAdhering \n\nparticles \n\nPercussion \n\nmarks \n\nHB 0.02-0.03 14 3.143 1.643 4.643 4.500 0.286 \n\nHB 0.05-0.06 14 3.643 2.500 3.071 3.429 0.643 \n\nHB 0.07-0.08 12 3.250 2.000 3.000 3.500 0.083 \n\nHB 0.09-0.10 14 2.214 0.929 3.857 4.429 0.357 \n\n \n\n5.5.5.

The tempestite samples were \n\nmainly composed by amphiboles (>79.352%) with the highest result obtained for sample HB_(0.05-0.06) \n\nwith 86.555% of the sample. Andalusite exhibited its highest value (i.e. 6.047%) for the base of the deposit \n\nand its lowest value (i.e. 1.619%) for sample HB_(0.07-0.08).

Discussion \n\n6.1. Textural signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\nAll studied areas present a peculiar/unique lithostratigraphic signature in the top of each sites \n\nHolocene sequence. These signatures are found in sediment units that are correlatable with specific \n\nextreme marine inundations that affected each location. The dates of inundations were obtained through the \n\nextrapolation of radiocarbon ages, the computation of sedimentation rates based in radionuclides decay rate \n\nor in previous work conducted in the studied or nearby areas. \n\nA conspicuous erosional/unconformity basal contact, generally observed in tsunamigenic deposits \n\nreported in the literature and indicative of the energetic character of the events responsible for their \n\ndeposition, was observed in all studied areas and was also detected in the tempestite storm deposit of \n\nStoneybridge, thus in accordance with Switzer (2008) that also recognized a sharp basal contact in storm \n\ndeposits in Australia. Moreover, and also revealing the high energy involved, rip-up clasts were detected in \n\nall tsunamigenic units but were absent in the storm deposit. In cases, the amount of  erosion of the \n\nunderlying layers may have been considerable (e.g. in Salgados, erosion may have removed sediment \n\naccumulated throughout  at least 800 cal years, calculated after radiocarbon dates of top unit D and base of \n\nunit F). These observations are in agreement with the findings of Minoura and Nakaya (1991), Bondevik et \n\nal. (1997), Nanayama et al. (2000) and Dawson and Stewart (2007) that correlate the presence of intraclasts \n\nripped from soft underlying units with the enormous erosive capacity associated with a tsunami inundation. \n\nIn agreement with Phantuwongraj and Choowong (2011), rip-up clasts are rare or absent in storm deposits \n\nprobably due to the dominance of the inflow sedimentation and especially the constrasting intensity and \n\nduration of each inundation pulse. \n\nThe enrichment in broken shells of marine bivalves and also of tests and valves of both foraminifera \n\nand ostracods, which is another peculiar feature commonly observed in tsunamigenic deposits (e.g. Moore \n\nand Moore 1988; Bryant et al. 1992; Albert\u00e3o and Martins 1996; Imamura et al. 1997; Clague et al., 1999; \n\nDonato et al., 2008), was only clearly perceived in the Portuguese and Indonesian samples and was not \n\ndetected in the Scottish case, probably due to contrasting specific biological associations, taphonomical \n\nconstrains and hydrodynamic conditions. In fact, the interpretation of the Scottish sedimentary sequences \n\n(from sediments of the tsunami and characterizing the permanent regime) relies essentially upon diatom \n\nproxies, which are extremely rare in the Portuguese case. \n\nAll deposits addressed exhibited a clear inland-thinning trend although conditioned by specific \n\npalaeotopographic characteristics, reaching distances in the order of 3 km away from the coast. In \n\nagreement with the findings of Gelfenbaum et al. (2007), tsunami deposits in Salgados, Boca do Rio and \n\nLhok Nga were thicker in topographic lows (areas of spatial flow deceleration ) and thin over topographic \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n162 \n \n\nhighs (areas of spatial flow acceleration). Furthermore, in all studied sites, macroscopic observations \n\nperformed in the field at the scale of the outcrops or exposures remarked fining upward tendencies although, \n\nin cases, the laboratory processing of samples failed to confirm this feature, probably due to the presence of \n\nscattered gritt, large shell and/or plant fragments, occasionally captured in the small subsamples used for \n\nlab analyses. \n\nAlthough turbulent flows such as the ones associated with tsunami inundations are intrinsically \n\nchaotic and, by consequence, the associated processes of deposition and erosion are complex and varied at \n\nshort time and spatial scales, it is possible to find some consistency in assess the grain-size characteristics \n\nof the depositional product and attempt to establish likely source materials. \n\nIn Salgados, the sediment grain size of the tsunami layer decreases inland and upwards typically \n\nwithin one ? interval, in all samples where that layer is thicker than 0.03m. At the inland edge of the deposit, \n\nthe sediment thickness is typically less than 0.03m; here, the sand is finer and shows poorer sorting (larger  \n\nstandard deviations); the mean grain-size of the whole sediment markedly drops, mainly due to three \n\nreasons: decrease in size of the coarser fraction, enrichment in mud (either contemporaneous of the \n\ndepositon or induced by post-deposition illuviation) and sampling limitations, i.e. difficulty in retrieving a very \n\nthin layer of tsunami sediment with ghosty contacts preventing contamination by the framing muddy \n\nsediment. The same difficulty applies to other locations worldwide, though it has rarely been made explicit by \n\nthe authors, and should be taken in consideration in interpretations of existing and future studies. \n\nA pronounced contrast in the content of sand and consequently of the mean grain size (see Figure \n\n6.1 for example) is detectable at the very base of all studied units laid down by extreme marine inundations, \n\nwhen compared with the underlying materials. Moreover, further upward in the high-energy sandy units, the \n\nsediment is virtually homogeneous in size or normally graded (with the exception of Lhok Nga, see below). \n\nThis fact leads to the absence or to difficulties in identifying sedimentary structures besides a \n\nmassive/chaotic character that is common to many tsunami deposits, hence in accordance with the \n\nsuggestions previously forwarded by Dawson et al.(1995) and Dahanayake and Kulasena (2008). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 - Percentage of sand and calcium carbonate within the tsunamigenic unit E on cores LV7 and LV10 (Salgados). \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n163 \n \n\nThe Indonesian tsunamigenic unit presented a complex stratigraphy with multiple coarser and finer \n\nlaminae and layers correspondent to several waves of the 2004 tsunami. Furthermore, in Lhok Nga, very \n\nfine sediments were deposited as extremely thin mud drapes during periods of lower flow velocities, \n\nseparating coarser sub-units associated with different wave pulses or backwashes. In the case of Lhok Nga, \n\nas discussed by Paris et al. (2007), normally-graded couplets or triplets of layers were used to identify the \n\nrun-up of each wave. Furthermore, the topmost layer was interpreted as backwash deposition (presenting a \n\nseaward decrease in mean grain-size). This very recent tsunamigenic deposit is unique in that, it exhibits \n\nclear textural constrasts and accumulated texturally-distinguishable sub-units throughout the depocenter \n\nregion, in contrast with many other tsunamigenic deposits, either the ones studied here or others reported in \n\nthe literature; this fact might suggest that sedimentary structures and sub-units such as the ones preserved \n\nin Lhok Nga may actually have formed elsewhere but were rapidly degraded or homegeneized, thus \n\ncontributing to enhance the massive character of the deposits. This is in agreement with the findings of \n\nSzczucinski (2011) who observed the progressive disappearence of sedimentary structures and features \n\nfrom the same locations and sediment layers in 5 consecutive yearly campaigns in a study of the 2004 \n\nIndian Ocean tsunami deposition. The reasoning above should be present when inferences on the number \n\nof waves or vectorial properties of the flow are straightforwardly taken from sedimentary units deposited by \n\nold inundation events. \n\nTsunami deposits can vary immensely from location to location, mainly due to regional to local \n\ngeological, geomorphological and climate constrains, all of which play a part in determining differences in \n\nsediment sources. Grain-size variation in tsunamiites is determined by the dimensional range of sediment \n\navailable for transport, rather than by flow capacity (Bourgeois, 2009), maybe with the only exception of \n\ngigantic megaclats, which require exceptional flow conditions. In the sedimentary units addressed in this \n\nstudy (Table 6.2) the mean grain size roughly correspond to fine to medium sand although, as mentioned \n\nabove, sampling limitations, occasional shell or plant fragments may have influenced the laboratory results, \n\ndue to the fact that they are not hydraulic equivalents of the lithic or mineralogical grains with which they \n\ncoexist in the sediment. The tsunamiite from Salgados (once more where its thickness exceeds 0.03m) \n\npresents essentially an unimodal grain size distribution, which suggests predominance of one sedimentary \n\nsource. The same pattern was observed in all other studied areas, except Lhok Nga. Indeed, Paris et al. \n\n(2007) used textural data to suggest that in Lhok Nga the 2004 Indian tsunami deposit may have been \n\nnourished from the beach with relevant contributions from the shallow shelf, the coral reef, the lagoons and \n\nthe dunes. \n\nAll sites addressed in this study other than Lhok Nga yielded high energy sediment with standard \n\ndeviation roughly below 1 ? thus suggesting that the source material was probably well sorted and normally \n\ndistributed. This is in accordance with Bahlburg and Weiss (2007) that analysed the grain-size distributions \n\nof tsunami materials deposited by the 2004 tsunami in the Indian and Kenyan coasts. Moreover, those \n\ndeposits were essentially characterized by symmetrical or slightly positively-skewed size distributions and \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n164 \n \n\nthis was interpreted as confirming that the tsunami sediment was entrained from well sorted pre-tsunami \n\nmaterials available in the nearshore and beach environments. In the case of Lagoa dos Salgados, a similar \n\npattern was detected in the size distribution of sediments from both unit E and dune/beach material from \n\npresent-day analogues. Tsunamiites and tempestite from Portugal and Scotland exhibit a slightly positive \n\nkurtosis (leptokurtic curves), which, according to Bahlburg and Weiss (2006), might suggest a limited size-\n\ninterval of the source material, in contrast with a platykurtic kurtosis reported by Paris et al. 2007 indicating \n\nmultiple sediment sources in Lhok Nga. \n\n Numerous authors attempted to use textural parameters to differentiate sedimentary environments \n\nor transport mechanisms with controversial results (e.g. Mason and Folk, 1958; Friedman, 1961; Shepard \n\nand Young, 1961; Visher, 1969; McLaren, 1981; McLaren and Bowes, 1985). In the case of Salgados \n\n(where a larger number of samples were collected from nearshore, beach and dune) this was crudely \n\nachieved using the 10% ? and 90% ? percentiles and skewness (Table 6.1) of the grain size distribution. \n\nNearshore samples presented the largest standard deviation thus exhibiting larger differences between \n\nvalues for 10% ? and 90% ? percentiles. As a result of their study of sediments in Brazos River bar, Texas, \n\nMason and Folk (1958) concluded that skewness is sensitive to transport and depositional environment. In \n\ntheir study case, beach samples were negatively skewed while dunes were positively skewed. Friedman \n\n(1961) confirmed these findings. Our results in Salgados do not corroborate those conclusions (Table 6.1). \n\nMoreover, McLaren (1981) concluded that mean grain size, sorting and skewness are dependent of the \n\nsource of the deposit and independent of transportation process or sedimentary environment. Our results \n\nvalidate this conclusion due to higher similarities found between tsunamiites and dune and beach samples. \n\nIn the case of Salgados and Boca do Rio it is also evident that the eroded underlying (finer-grained) unit was \n\nalso a relevant sedimentary contributor for the tsunamigenic layer in both studied areas. \n\nOn the other hand, McLaren and Bowles (1985) concluded that sedimentary deposits may become \n\neither: a) coarser, better sorted, and more positively skewed (in high energy transport) or finer, better sorted; \n\nor b) more negatively skewed (in low energy regime). In the Salgados case, tsunami samples are more \n\npositively skewed (mean value of 0.167) than their likely source material (Table 6.1); thus, according to \n\nMcLaren and Bowles (1985) model, this textural shift indicates a source-deposit relation and confirms the \n\nhigh energy character of the transport agent responsible for the emplacement of the tsunamigenic unit. \n\nFriedman (1967) questioned if grain size analysis will ever be helpful in environmental \n\ninterpretation. Our conclusion is that if a given deposit is related to more than one source, it is extremely \n\ndifficult to use mean grain size, sorting or skewness as useful sedimentological tools in the differentiation of \n\nthe parental material source. Our textural data confirmed what has been commonly reported elsewhere for \n\nsediment entrained, transported and deposited by tsunami waves: they transport essentially sediment that is \n\navailable in the coastal fringe (e.g. Dawson 1994; Moore et al. 1994; Atwater and Moore, 1992; Clague and \n\nBobrowsky, 1994; Hindson et al., 1996; Dawson, 2004; Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007; Oliveira et al., 2009; \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n165 \n \n\nParis et al., 2010b; Goff et al., 2010a; Costa et al., 2012a,b); the concept of coast being restricted the \n\nclosure depth. \n\nTable 6.1 - Mean values for textural data from present day analogues from Salgados. \n\n 10% ? 90% ? \nMean \n\n(?) \n\nStandard \n\ndeviation \n\n(?) \n\nKurtosis Skewness \n\nBeach (n=7) 0.006 1.66 0.84 0.66 1.05 1.11 \n\nDune (n=9) 0.192 1.75 0.98 0.61 1.05 1.04 \n\nNearshore \n\n(n=7) \n-0.602 2.27 0.90 1.10 1.08 1.83 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.2 - Summary of sedimentological data by studied site.

Morphoscopic signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\nEvery sedimentary environment is characterized by specific energy conditions, which vary in time \n\nand space, those fluctuations representing temporary shifts, departures, from modal conditions that define \n\nthe permanent regime. The results obtained in this study show that the contrasting energetic character and \n\ntransport mechanisms associated with tsunamigenic events and the nearshore hydrodynamics, including \n\noccasional high energy storm events, translate into compositional characteristics, roundness and sphericity \n\nattributes of sediment particles. In the case of Salgados, principal component analysis reveals that it is \n\npossible to distinguish nearshore and tsunami sediments in compositional terms. In Figure 6.2, tsunamis \n\nsamples are positively correlated with the percentage of quartz (right hemisphere) whereas, by contrast, \n\nnearshore samples are grouped in association with larger representation of bioclasts and lithic material. This \n\nindicates that the coastal dune and beach were the main sedimentary source of the tsunami sediments in \n\ncontrast with the nearshore environment which, despite the sand abundance, contributed with little material \n\nto that particular deposit. \n\n Roundness varies with the size-class considered within the same detritic sediment, so by \n\nconcentrating the analysis in one size fraction, common to different samples, comparability between data \n\nwas maintained. Results obtained in this study from Salgados and Boca do Rio are not in agreement with \n\nHails (1967) which state that it is impossible to distinguish between beach and dune sands exclusively by \n\nconsidering roundness. In fact, the differentiation of these two sedimentary environments (i.e. beach and \n\ndune) is illustrated by higher roundness characteristics of dune samples (right quadrants \u2013 Figure 6.3 and \n\n6.5) in contrast with more angular grains in beach sediment (left quadrants \u2013 Figures 6.3 and 6.5). In \n\naccordance with Beal and Shepard (1956) the difference in roundness between dune and beach sediments \n\nis only relative rather than absolute, which recommends caution in the interpretation of results if this proxy is \n\nsolely used in reconstructing paleoenvironments in stratigraphic studies. The latter authors also concluded \n\nthat quartz grains in dunes were more rounded than in adjacent beaches and attributed that difference \n\nmainly to selective sorting by wind transport rather than abrasion, as inferred by many other authors. \n\nKumbrein (1941) suggested that in Nature there is a close correlation between sphericity and \n\nroundness of clastic particles, although these attributes are conceptually independent. With a given distance \n\nof transport, roundness changes more significantly than sphericity because roundness is more sensitive to \n\nsmall-scaled features (i.e. edges of grains) whereas sphericity is more dependent of the major dimensional \n\nratio, which requires much more energy to change, hence being a function of source (Mason and Folk, \n\n1958). In Salgados and Boca do Rio (Figure 6.4 and 6.6), sphericity was only able to be of practical use in \n\nthe former case, nearshore samples tending to group in the right quadrant, in opposition with all remaining \n\nsamples. \n\nIn conclusion, based in morphoscopic features of quartz grains studied, it was possible to establish \n\nlikely sources and differentiate sedimentary environments. However, the differences are essentially \n\nqualitative and critical reserve should be applied when analysing and interpreting results elsewhere. In \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n168 \n \n\nSalgados (Figure 6.2 and 6.4), it was clear both through the compositional pattern, as well as considering \n\nsphericity, that nearshore samples share the less affinity with tsunamiite samples. Furthermore, in Salgados \n\nit was also possible to use roundness (Figure 6.3) to differentiate more angular (beach, nearshore, storm, \n\ntsunami) from more rounded (nearshore and dune) samples, thus allowing distinction between dune and \n\nbeach samples. In Boca do Rio (Figure 6.5) it was possible to discriminate samples using roundness: \n\nsamples with more angular grains [beach, tsunami, one proximal nearshore (-7.5 m)] cluster and plot \n\nseparately from the rest of the studied sediments. On the other hand, sphericity (Figure 6.6) allowed \n\nseparating nearshore from tsunami sands. Thus, these results suggest similar conclusions to the ones \n\nobtained in Salgados in terms of parental materials for the tsunami sediment: the nearshore region was the \n\nless likely sedimentary source of the AD 1755 tsunami that strongly affected these two coastal areas of the \n\nAlgarve. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 \u2013 Principal component analysis; morphoscopic compositional study of Salgados samples.

Both arguments are effective, especially if considering \n\nthe low number of samples used. By contrast, in Lhok Nga, roundness allowed clear differentiation of the \n\nsediment samples deposited by the tsunami backwash (see Figure 6.7 - left quadrants, backwash samples) \n\nwhereas sphericity allowed discriminating the base of the deposit (Figure 6.8 - top quadrants). These results \n\nsuggest that time played an important role in the rounding of grains because at the base of the deposit \n\n(inrushing water and sediment) they are more angular than in the backwash samples. This rounding could \n\nhave occurred because of difference in sources (the backwash could have added an extra source supplying \n\nmature grains located inland) or by rapid smoothening or removal of edges and corners induced by effective \n\ngrain-grain collisions during transport. The latter hypothesis raises questions in terms of the transport \n\nduration necessary to transform sand-sized angular quartz grains in more rounded ones. The issue has \n\nbeen debated for larger particles and there is a wide consensum that high-energy and turbulent transport is \n\nactually able to produce rapid changes of surface features in quartz particles (i.e. short-distance and \n\nevolution of roundness); however, in shallow marine environments, the roundness and luster characterizing \n\nquartz sand may essentially be acquired by pressure-induced near-bottom vibration induced by travelling \n\nwaves, rather than impact between particles moving alongshore or cross shore and entrained, re-suspended \n\nand deposited by coastal currents. To what extent a high-density extremely turbulent flow saturated with \n\nsuspended sand and moving inland at high speed, such as a tsunami, can be effective in producing similar \n\nreworking patterns of the grains surface, in a very short time-span, remains an open question. Although \n\ndeparting a bit from the central objectives of this dissertation, the question above is further discussed in the \n\nfollowing sub-chapter of this thesis and the rationale, results and conclusions of an experiment addressing \n\nthat issue may be found in Costa et al. (2012c). In three of the five studied areas, morphoscopic analysis \n\nproved to be a useful tool in the discrimination of environments and/or in the establishment of likely source \n\nmaterial for extreme marine inundations. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n171 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.7 \u2013 Principal component analysis; roundness of Lhok Nga samples. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.8 \u2013 Principal component analysis; sphericity of Lhok Nga samples. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n172 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n173 \n \n\n6.3. Microtextural signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\nSeveral attempts (e.g. Krinsley and Margolis, 1969; Bettencourt et al., 1989; Pyokari, 1997; Abu-\n\nZeid et al., 2001; Mahaney et al., 2001; Bull and Morgan, 2006; Costa et al., 2009; Deane, 2010) have been \n\nmade in order to characterize surface microscopic signatures in quartz  grains from distinct sedimentary \n\nenvironments. The results proposed have been controversial and far from unanimous in the identification of \n\nfeatures, interpretation of inprinting mechanisms or processes, and association of specific microtextural \n\nsignatures with specific sedimentary environments.  \n\nMahaney (2002) characterized a group of 41 microtextural features and suggested the association \n\nof some features with specific environments (e.g. percussion marks in aqueous environments; bulbous \n\nedges in aeolian environments); however, no grains associated with high energy inundation events were \n\nanalysed in this study. By contrast, Krinsley and Donahue (1968) established that specific differences exist \n\ndepending on the environment of transportation and deposition; however, they also suggested that river \n\ntransport and turbidity current movement do not impress characteristic surface textures on quartz sand \n\ngrains.  \n\nRecently, Madhavaraju et al. (2009) examined quartz grains under the scanning electron \n\nmicroscope and defined thirty two distinct microtextures that they grouped into three modes of origin, i.e., \n\nmechanical (eighteen features), mechanical and/or chemical (five features) and chemical (seven features). \n\nEven in the same sedimentary environment, changes were detected. In agreement with these findings, \n\nManickam and Barbaroux (1987) observed that in the Loire River (France) chemical features are dominant \n\nduring winter while mechanical features dominate during the summer. Furthermore, Lis\u00e1 (2004) detected \n\nthat in the case of typical aeolian sediments; about 10% of the fraction studied will not show any surface \n\nmicrotextures typical of aeolian transport.  \n\nOne of the main problems in addressing these issues is the subjectivity and the discrepancy of \n\nobservations made by different observers. In one attempt to verify operator variance, Culver et al. (1983) \n\ntested through five different observers the classification of eight samples and thirty two surface microtextural \n\nfeatures and concluded that differences, although considerable in the recognition of individual surface \n\nfeatures, were negligible in discrimination/grouping of samples. Although much has been done, one of the \n\nrequirements that need to be addressed in the future is to standardize the definitions of microtextural \n\nfeatures and in that sense the work by Mahaney (2002) should be used as the best available reference. \n\nMoreover, one tool that should be used to minimize the inter-observer incongruity is the use of wide-range \n\nstatistical analyses. Mahaney et al. (2001) concluded that statistical measurements show the importance of \n\ngrain overprinting and, in the opinion of the author, their use should be mandatory in grain surface \n\nmicroscopic studies. \n\nThe analysis of microtexture box-plot diagrams (Figure 6.9) for each group of samples adressed in \n\nthis study allowed identificating the characteristic features associated with each sedimentary environment. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n174 \n \n\nThe angularity parameter, although not being per se a distinctive microtextural differentiator (e.g. majority of \n\ngrains are either sub-angular or sub-rounded), provides interesting data, with the highest median values for \n\nstorm and beach grains but the highest values (more angular) are observed in tsunami grains that also \n\npresent a wide range of values. \n\nNearshore samples and alluvial samples exhibit the lowest median values of fresh surfaces, while the \n\nhighest, as well as the broadest array values, have been observed in dune, beach and tsunami grains. \n\nAdhering particles and dissolution features present similar patterns with the highest median values for \n\nalluvial grains, although storm deposits also exhibit high values. Tsunami and beach presented lower \n\nmedian values and tsunami, storm and beach, once more, presented the widest range of values. \n\nIn respect to percussion marks, the highest median values were observed in tsunami, dune and beach \n\ngrains. However, tsunami grains yielded the highest values (above 3.5) suggesting a major resurfacing of \n\nthe grain by this microtextural signature. \n\nThe data analysed strongly suggest that a geographical signature is also present in sample \n\ngrouping, thus indicating, at least partially, the permanency of a source signature, which may exhibit a \n\nconsiderable variation between the different coastal environments addressed. \n\nThe tsunami grains are generally characterized by a large number of fresh surfaces (Indonesian \n\nsamples presenting highest median values for fresh surfaces and angularity) (Figure 6.10). Moreover, the \n\nScottish tsunami samples present strong dissolution (interpreted as post-depositional and favoured by a long \n\npost-event burial period) but the number of fresh surfaces that can be identified is still considerable. On the \n\nother hand, the Portuguese samples are characterized not only by larger numbers of fresh surfaces (when \n\ncompared with potential source material: nearshore, beach, dune and alluvial) but also by the extremely \n\nabundant percussion marks including near total resurfacing of some grains. The Portuguese samples \n\npresent a strong dominance of percussion-marks on grain surfaces (up to 50% of the population analysed), \n\nwith an almost complete resurfacing of the grain. The Scottish (storm and tsunami) and Indonesian tsunami \n\nsamples show clear dominance of fresh surfaces, even if masked by post-event dissolution (Shetland \n\nsamples). \n\nBivariate and ternary plots reveal differences and relationships between the samples studied in \n\nwhat relates microtextural imprints. One example is Figure 6.11, where percussion marks and dissolution \n\nare plotted. In this figure it is noticed that the vast majority of nearshore samples presented low values of \n\npercussion marks and high values of dissolution. The same pattern is observed in alluvial samples. On the \n\nother hand, beach samples show low dissolution and few percussion marks. By comparison, dunes present \n\nslightly higher values of dissolution and percussion marks. As observed in Figure 6.11, tsunami and storm \n\nsamples exhibit a strong regional imprint. The Portuguese tsunami samples present high values of \n\npercussion marks and low values of dissolution, while tsunami samples from Indonesia and Shetland do not \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n175 \n \n\npresent significant values of percussion marks but share low values of dissolution with the Portuguese \n\ntsunami samples. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.9 \u2013 Analysis of microtexture features in box-plot diagrams for each group of samples (extreme marine inundations \nand sedimentary environments). \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n176 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.10 \u2013 Comparison of microtextural (angularity; fresh surfaces; dissolution; adhering particles; percussion marks) \nresults according to the location where the tsunami or storm samples were collected. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 6.12 ternary plots were drawn and relationships between fresh surfaces, percussion \n\nmarks, adhering particles or dissolution are observed. The relationship between fresh surfaces, percussion \n\nmarks and dissolution is plotted in Figure 6.12A and it is possible to note that alluvial and nearshore samples \n\ntypically present low values of fresh surfaces and percussion marks, but are characterized by high values of \n\ndissolution. By contrast, beach and tsunami samples present high values of fresh surfaces and low values of \n\ndissolution. The highest values of percussion marks can be observed in the Portuguese tsunami and storm \n\nsamples. Moreover, in Figure 6.12B relationships between fresh surfaces, percussion marks and dissolution \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n177 \n \n\nfeatures are apparent. This figure replicates the pattern exhibited by Figure 6.12A but is important to stress \n\nthat nearshore and alluvial samples present high values of adhering particles and tsunami and beach \n\nsamples present lower values. Dune samples (visible in both figures 6.12A and 6.12B) presented typical \n\nmean values in the microtextures observed. \n\nPrincipal components analysis allowed extracting the two main factors representing more than 80% \n\nof the total variability. Indeed, the orthogonal axes observed in Figure 6.13 are related with 4 major groups of \n\nmicrotextural features. Their association with the sedimentary samples can be observed in Figure 6.12. It is \n\nnoted that Component 1 (x-axis in Figure 6.13) indicates  opposition between dissolution/adhering particles \n\n(component 1, positive values) and percussion marks and fresh surfaces (component 1, negative values), \n\nthus being a good indicator of the (hydro)dynamic conditions in the sedimentary environment. On the other \n\nhand, Component 2 (y-axis in Figure 6.13) depicts the opposition between percussion marks (top sector, \n\npositive values) and angularity (lower sector, negative values). Component 1 allows a clear differentiation \n\nbetween the two sets of microtextural families; one, more related with mechanical features (angularity, fresh \n\nsurfaces and percussion marks, related with mechanical reworking processes) and another group of \n\nmicrotextures related with chemical processes (dissolution and adhering particles). As one can observe in \n\nFigure 6.13, in terms of sedimentary discrimination of environments, although a large majority of samples \n\ncan be inserted in one specific quadrant (e.g. nearshore and alluvial samples on the top right quadrant; \n\nbeach and tsunami samples are mostly present in the left quadrants; dune samples are mostly in the centre \n\nof the chart) there still is considerable variation of samples within each quadrant. \n\nFrom the above, we suggest that the use of only one microtexture to determine sedimentary \n\nenvironment is probably an invalid approach. After completing the analysis of our dataset we recommend \n\nthat in the future one should use, at least, five microtextural features and a considerable number of grains. It \n\nis important to note geographical variations and to keep in mind that no sole microtexture can be applied \n\nworldwide to a unique sedimentary environment, although in the majority of environments there are some \n\nmicrotextural associations that are dominant. The group of five microtextural features described above \n\nallowed the characterization of several sedimentary environments as summarized below: \n\nAlluvial- High values of dissolution and adhering particles. Moderate presence of percussion marks. \n\nBeach- Highest percentage of fresh surface and strong presence of percussion marks. Dissolution and \n\nadhering particles are almost absent. \n\nDune- Presents a well balance representation of all the microtextural features. \n\nNearshore- High values of dissolution and adhering particles and moderate presence of percussion marks \n\nand fresh surfaces. \n\nStorm- Although a regional factor might influence the data (4 out 5 samples are from the Hebrides, \n\nScotland), storm grains present many similarities with beach samples and can only be differentiated from \n\nthose by the broadest variety of values observed. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n178 \n \n\nTsunami- Presents the highest values of percussion marks and fresh surfaces (thus suggesting strong \n\nhydrodynamic processes before deposition). Tsunami grains can also be characterized by presenting the \n\nwidest range of values observed in the microtextural features. \n\nAlthough the number of samples is not perfectly balanced (lower number of samples for alluvial and \n\nstorm samples; higher number of tsunami) these results suggest that it is possible to differentiate quartz \n\ngrains from different sedimentary environments as long as it is possible to compare them to a representative \n\nset of grains from a specific study area. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.11 \u2013 Bivariate plot of percussion marks vs dissolution on all samples analysed. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.12 \u2013 Ternary plots of percussion marks, fresh surface and dissolution (left image) and percussion marks, fresh \nsurface and adhering particles (right image) on all samples analysed.

However, \n\nthis feature was not observed in other tsunami and storm deposits (Scotland and Indonesia) where fresh \n\nsurfaces dominated and increased when compared with possible source material. The difference can be \n\nexplained by the presence of an extra sedimentary source (e.g. dunes), which is the case of the Portuguese \n\nstudy areas. This fact would increase the sediment concentration and likely would cause more impacts \n\nbetween grains although with less kinetic energy involved in the impacts because they would have less \n\nspace to gain velocity before collision. Furthermore, this fact suggests that the sediment concentration \n\ncontrol the presence/increase of specific microtextural signatures in tsunami and storm grains. The increase \n\nin the energy involved in deposition of high energy events, when compared with permanent-regime \n\nsedimentation, tends to be represented in quartz grains as an increase in percussion marks or fresh \n\nsurfaces. Although grains tend to maintain some inherited microtextural characteristics, total resurfacing of \n\ngrains may occur but mainly in areas closer to the coast. \n\nThe origin of percussion marks has been a contentious matter. For instance, Campbell (1963) \n\nindicated that little evidence can be found to support the thesis that percussion markings on sand-size \n\nparticles can be done in an aqueous environment. On the other hand, Mahaney (2002), Madhavaraju et al. \n\n(2009) and Deane (2010) suggested that V-shaped patterns of mechanical origin mainly originate in \n\nsubaqueous medium with high-energy conditions. Lind\u00e9 and Mycielska-Dowgia??o (1980) tested grains (in \n\nsedimentary environments and experimentally) and noted that there are differences in the occurrence of the \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n180 \n \n\nV-shaped forms found on natural and experimental sand grains, but their similarity nevertheless proves that \n\nthe grains were subjected to mechanical abrasion in aqueous environment. So, it is manifest that although \n\nthe origin of percussion marks is still a matter under discussion it is typically associated with aqueous high \n\nenergy conditions of grain mobilization. \n\nThe approach addopted, both with field and experimental data, suggests that the generation of \n\npercussion marks is strongly linked with high sediment concentration and transport by grain flow. As \n\nBagnold (1962) stated, sediment with a volume concentration greater than 9% would, as a rule, not move in \n\nsuspension and Hsu (2004) suggested that concentrated dispersions of grains tend to move by grain \n\ncollision. Furthermore, Mulder and Alexander (2001) suggested that in sediment mixtures with 40% or more \n\nsediment-volume concentrations are not physically turbidity currents, as in such high concentrations they are \n\nno longer supported by fluid turbulence, because grain interactions play the dominant role. Hanes (1986) \n\nmodelled water flow as two fluid regions with continuous stress, velocity and granular concentration \n\noverlying a stationary bed: a collision-dominated granular fluid region and a wall-bounded turbulent-fluid \n\nshear region with saltating grains. \n\nIt is argue here that grain interaction, within an aqueous environment with high sediment \n\nconcentration (i.e. typical in tsunami evens - Gelfenbaum et al., 2007; Paris et al., 2009, 2010b), is the main \n\nprocess responsible for the abundance in percussion marks detected in our dataset. \n\nIn order to answer that question one experiment was conducted using a magnetic stirrer within a \n\ncontainer with water and sediment. The purpose of the experiment was to test the microtextural implications \n\nof aqueous transport at different time scales (6 and 60 minutes), different velocities (700 and 1100 magnet \n\nrotations per minute) and different sediment concentrations (2, 20 and 40%). The proportion of sand and \n\nglass microspheres (chosen because of their similarity with quartz, economical cost and clean surfaces) \n\nused was 1/3 of microspheres and 2/3 of beach sand. After each run, microspheres were selected and SEM \n\nimages obtained. Furthermore, the microtextures detected in each microsphere, were counted and were \n\nlater compared with features photographed in pre-experiment (non-used) microspheres (Figure 6.14). \n\nThe results obtained show a higher number of shallow mechanical imprints (e. g. percussion-like \n\nmarks) at the higher sediment concentration (40%) range. In contrast, larger areas of a single sphere were \n\naffected at the lower concentration regime (2%) and the marks presented high relief, thus suggesting \n\nstronger impacts. Velocity and time increases translated in intensifications in the frequency of microtextural \n\nfeatures. \n\nThe experiment proved that a relatively short period of time is enough to imprint significant abrasion \n\nmarks in microspheres, thus strongly suggesting that short-lived events can produce strong imprints in \n\nquartz grains. However, they do not produce significantly shallow (percussion mark like) impacts. In fact, the \n\nmicrotextures produced were fresh surfaces, fractures and abrasion affecting areas of different sizes. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n181 \n \n\nThe laboratory experiments confirmed the data collected and observed in a wide range of \n\nsedimentary environments establishing that short lived events are capable of imprinting the surface of quartz \n\ngrains and also demonstrating that sediment concentration and velocities of the water flow are conditioning \n\nfactors of type, frequency and incision-depth of microtextural features sculptured in the surface of clastic \n\nparticles. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.14 \u2013 Glass microsphere image. A \u2013 Microsphere image before experiments. B \u2013 Microsphere image after 60 \nminutes at 1100 rpm with a sediment concentration of 20%. Red arrow marks fresh surface. C \u2013 Microsphere image after 6 \nminutes at 1100 rpm with a sediment concentration of 2%. Red arrow marks fresh surface. D - Microsphere image after 60 \n\nminutes at 700 rpm with a sediment concentration of 40%. Red arrows mark percussion marks and white arrow marks long \nabrasion mark. \n\n \n\nThis experiment suggests that time plays an important role in terms of the frequency of \n\nmicrotextural signatures, but the energy-level involved and sediment concentration associated with each \n\nevent are the main factors that control which and how much microtextural imprints are observed in the  \n\ngrains. Based in our results we argue that short lived high-energy events of coastal inundation are \n\nundoubtedly capable of resurfacing, totally or partially, quartz grains sourced in the vicinity of the deposition \n\nplace. \n\nThe experimental results indicate that when entrained in a low-concentration regime, the \n\nmicrotextural signatures developing and affecting the particle surface are mainly deep impact features and \n\nfresh surfaces, while percussion marks are only present in higher concentration regimes (Figure 6.14C and \n\n6.14D). This suggests that the sediment concentration plays a significant role in the microtextural features \n\nthat are produced during high energy aqueous events. The experimental results suggest that lower sediment \n\nconcentration allows the grains to reach higher velocities upon impact which is put in evidence by the deeper \n\nimprints in the grains surface in the lower sediment concentration regime. Furthermore, the different \n\nvelocities tested indicate that the main microtextural difference is the frequency of microtextures observed, \n\nalso implying a relationship between velocity of transport and frequency of imprints in the grains surface. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n182 \n \n\nOne example that supports the arguments presented is the findings of Wang et al. (1982) that \n\nanalysed grains from turbidites in the Canadian continental margin. The authors concluded that the grains \n\nmaintained their original shape, even if their edges appeared to be slightly rounded, but the microtextural \n\nfeatures were superimposed by \u201can abundance of collision-induced marks, particularly mechanical V-forms\u201d. \n\nSome of the previous SEM studies on tsunami deposits did not focus in quartz but ilmenite grains - \n\nBabu et al., 2007 and Lakshmi et al., 2010 - and showed that the high intensity of tsunami wave action \n\ncaused severe deformation of ilmenite particles. The comparability of the results presented here with these \n\nresults is constrained by the different minerals (and characteristics) used. Studies that used quartz (Bruzzi \n\nand Prone, 2000; Costa et al., 2009) presented evidences that high-energy events (in both cases the AD \n\n1755 tsunami) were essentially characterized by source-inherited features. However, a few features were \n\nspecifically associated with tsunami transport, such as upturned plates, fractures and marks of considerable \n\nsize. \n\nNevertheless, the present findings provide further evidence that even though the exact source is \n\nsomewhat difficult to establish with clear-cut precision, that is primarily due to the fact that tsunami waves \n\ntransport grains from a wide range of environments, and they are capable of carving microtextural signatures \n\nin the grains. A tsunami-transported grain population should thus reflect the sedimentary environments \n\ncrossed by the tsunami waves (when they are close to the coast and capable of eroding, transporting and \n\ndepositing sediments, i.e., within the closure depth of the coastal zone) and the imprints that are marked in \n\nthe surface of grain during that event. The dominance of contemporaneous or pre-event signal depends not \n\nonly on the duration and energy of the event but also on the sediment concentration that controls the inter-\n\ngrain collision. \n\nA model of transport is proposed based in the microtextural features observed (Figure 6.15). In this \n\nmodel we suggest that the microtextural signatures observed in the surface of quartz grains are conditioned \n\nby the transport mechanism involved in each sedimentary environment. Thus, in the nearshore area (below \n\ndepth of closure) the dominant transport mechanism is the oscillatory movement of waves, in the beach \n\n(submerged and emerged) area the breaking of waves is the transport agent that dominates. On the other \n\nhand, in the dunes the wind is the transport agent that causes the movement of grains. Furthermore, in the \n\nalluvial plains the movement of grains is caused by occasional flooding episodes of fluvial origin. These \n\nmechanisms of transport of grains conditioned decisively the quantity and types of microtextural imprints \n\nobserved in the grains (cf. Figure 6.15A). \n\nWhen tsunami waves invade the coastal area, they are capable of eroding, transport and deposit \n\nlarge sediment masses. The type of microtextural signatures observed in quartz grains is, in our opinion, \n\nconditioned by the type of transport and sediment concentration during tsunami run-up. In Figure 6.15B a \n\nconceptual model is exhibited presenting the geographical areas where it is believed grain flow transport \n\ndominates (i.e. the slip face of the dune) and were the grains are subject to more percussion marks imprints. \n\nThe suspension and saltation mechanisms also occur but are present during the whole tsunamigenic \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n183 \n \n\ninvasion, while grain flow is constrained to a specific area where gravity and sediment concentration play \n\ndecisive roles. In the study areas where stable dunes are not present, the microtextural signatures to be \n\nobserved should present a complete lack or reduced number of microtextural features associated with grain \n\nflow (i.e. percussion marks) and a more clear dominance of fresh surfaces (associated with saltation and \n\nsuspension). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.15 - Conceptual transport model for sedimentary environments and high energy events based in microtextural \nfeatures of quartz grains analysed.

Heavy mineral signature of extreme marine inundations \n\nThe use of heavy minerals to establish provenance of tsunamigenic deposits has been sparsely \n\nattempted (e.g. Switzer et al., 2005; Bahlburg and Weiss, 2007; Szczucinski et al., 2006; Babu et al., 2007; \n\nMorton et al., 2007; Narayana et al., 2007; Higman and Bourgeois, 2008; Morton et al., 2008; Switzer and \n\nJones, 2008). Generally, local specificities in the assemblages of geological nature constrain extrapolation of \n\ninferences between field sites and, so far, the only feature commonly observed in all locations is a higher \n\nheavy mineral content in the basal part or basal sub-units (when the layer is stratigraphically complex) of \n\ntsunamigenic deposits and yet, the reason explaining this concentration is still not well understood. \n\nThe results obtained are in agreement with the above. In fact, as demonstrated for the tsunamiites \n\nand tempestites studied, the sampling region prevails as a grouping factor (Figure 6.16) when the whole of \n\nthe sample set is studied, thus demonstrating a regional conditioning factor as responsible for up to 75% of \n\nthe variance in tsunamigenic and storm deposits assemblages. Hence, samples need to be considered and \n\nanalysed by geographical regions if further discrimination is wanted to be extracted from the samples. \n\nOtherwise, when analysed overall, the regional character will prevail. \n\nIn the Portuguese studied areas the heavy mineral assemblages are dominated (>90%) by \n\nandalusite, tourmaline and staurolite. In Lhok Nga, about 90% of the heavy mineral population is composed \n\nof amphiboles and andalusite. In Scotland, in Voe of Scatsta, heavy minerals are almost exclusively (ca. \n\n90%) made of amphiboles; whereas in Stoneybridge the assemblage is dominated by amphiboles and \n\npyroxenes (>90%). The highest concentration of heavy minerals was detected in tempestites of \n\nStoneybridge mainly due to richer source material (i.e. Lewisian gneiss). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.16 \u2013 Principal component analysis of extreme marine inundations samples and their heavy mineral assemblage. \nNote: left image \u2013 IND \u2013 tsunami samples Indonesia; P \u2013 tsunami samples Portugal; Str_P \u2013 storm sample Portugal; Str_HB \n\n\u2013 storm sample Hebrides; SHT \u2013 tsunami samples Shetland. \n\n \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n186 \n \n\nThe Indonesian samples presented lower values of heavy mineral content in total sediment fraction \n\nand no trend was detectable. However, while Lhok Nga\u2019s tsunami samples exhibited a complex stratigraphy, \n\nother deposits analysed elsewhere were in essence massive. This is reflected in the heavy mineral results \n\nby the maximum horizontal and vertical variation in the proportion charecterizing each heavy mineral species \n\n(although without alterations in the assemblage) having been found in Indonesia and attributed to \n\npreservation of distinct depositional episodes including run-in and backwash and selective density controlled \n\ntransport. By contrast, the Portuguese and Scottish tsunami sediments are more homogenous, reflecting \n\npreservation of one sedimentation pulse or mixing promoted by multiple waves within a confined \n\naccommodation space. \n\nThus, the results are in accordance with Bahlburg and Weiss (2007) that detected higher heavy-\n\nmineral concentrations at the base of individual sand layers inferred to have been laid down by different \n\nwaves from the same event, and also in line with Morton et al. (2007), who concluded that storm and \n\ntsunami deposits can contain heavy-mineral laminae at the base and within the deposit because the heavy \n\nmineral assemblage is source dependent. \n\n To facilitate the discussion below, Table 6.3 summarizes the range of specific gravities for the \n\nminerals observed in the studied areas. It is possible to perceived that staurolite is the densest mineral in the \n\nPortuguese assemblages, while zircon and garnet were the denser minerals detected in Lhok Nga. In fact, in \n\nthe Lhok Nga\u2019s samples, it was observed that the higher values for zircon and garnet were detected in the \n\nbackwash sample and in the most inland sample, which suggest that the source of those minerals was \n\nsituated farther inland. \n\n \n\nTable 6.3 \u2013 Specific gravity for main minerals studied. \n\nMineral Specific gravity (g/cm\n3) \n\nStaurolite 3.65-3.75 \n\nAndalusite 3.16-3.20 \n\nTourmaline 3.00-3.25 \n\nPyroxene 3.03-3.96 \n\nAmphiboles 2.85-3.60 \n\nGarnet 3.10-4.30 \n\nZircon 4.60-4.70 \n\nQuartz 2.60-2.70 \n\n \n\nIn the cases of Salgados and Boca do Rio, principal component analysis shows that the first 2 \n\ncomponents explain more than 2/3 of the total variance in heavy mineral assemblages (Figure 6.19 and \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n187 \n \n\n6.22); tsunami samples share fewer similarities with nearshore materials and more resemblances with dune \n\nand, to a less extent, with beach sediment, thus indicating dune and beach as the more likely sources.  \n\nIn Salgados and Boca do Rio, results of heavy mineral studies allowed discriminating tsunami \n\nsediments from all possible source materials, the former generally showing higher proportions of heavy \n\nminerals in total sedimentand selective concentration of staurolite (densest heavy mineral identified in the \n\nassemblage). The discrepancies between the percentages of staurolite in the Portuguese studied areas \n\nmight be related with the more complex stratigraphy of Boca do Rio (cf. Hindson and Andrade, 1999) \n\nindicating that backwash sedimentation was present and conditioned the results obtained for that location. In \n\nthe studied samples of Boca do Rio, the stratigraphical contrast was not evident but heavy minerals suggest \n\nthat heavy mineral assemblage was probably conditioned by possible backwash. \n\n Figure 6.17 presents a ternary plot diagram (andalusite, staurolite and tourmaline) with samples \n\nfrom Salgados that demonstrates that all present-day analogues, tsunamiites and tempestite samples share \n\nmany similarities in terms of assemblages although with more similarities between dune and tsunami, thus, \n\nonce more suggesting the dune as the more likely (or relevant) sediment source for the tsunami deposit. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.17 \u2013 Ternary plot of staurolite, andalusite and tourmaline assemblages in Salgados. \n\n \n\nIn agreement with the above, Figure 6.18 demonstrates that tsunami samples from Salgados \n\npresent the highest percentage of heavy minerals and highest percentage of staurolite. These two facts \n\ncombined suggest a higher or selective transport capacity during this tsunami event. \n\nSample SG_14_(0.20-0.28), a likely storm deposit, present the highest concentration of staurolite \n\n(the densest heavy mineral of the assemblage), which might be related to what Mange and Wright (2007) \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n188 \n \n\ndescribed about swash on beaches during storms that are typically ideal for carrying away the quartz and \n\nfeldspar, while leaving behind the concentrated heavy minerals. However, the fact that this tempestite \n\nsample is a single example limits the robustness of the conclusion. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.18 \u2013 Percentage of heavy mineral in total sediment fraction (left image) and percentage of staurolite (right image) \nobserved in beach, dune, nearshore, tsunami and storm samples retrieved from Salgados. \n\n \n\nKomar and Wang (1984) documented on the Oregon coast the development of small black-sand \n\ndeposits during single storm events, the concentrating processes taking place within the zone of wave \n\nswash on the beach face. Swash processes are ideal for the development of heavy-mineral concentrates by \n\nthe selective winnowing of low-density quartz and feldspar, the heavy minerals lagging behind. However, \n\nthere is a marked enhancement of swash motions having periods >20 sec, the approximate upper limit of \n\nwave periods directly attributable to the storm. This long-period swash action, referred to as related with \n\ninfragravity waves, must obtain its energy indirectly from the storm, since it does increase with storm \n\nintensity and offshore wave height. These long-period swash motions are a major factor in producing erosion \n\nof the beach face and  the increase in the long-period infragravity swash on beaches during storms is ideal \n\nfor selectively winnowing away lighter minerals and  while leaving behind sediment concentrated in heavy \n\nminerals; thus, a functional analogy can be established with our results, that detected higher heavy mineral \n\nconcentration in tsunamiites, in association with the inrrush of a long-period wave reworking local sandy \n\nsediment. \n\nThe waves and currents in the outer portions of beaches are not as conducive to mineral sorting as \n\nin the swash zone. The breaker zone is characterized by high levels of turbulence, which carry sand in \n\nsuspension, thus having the effect of mixing of the sediments rather than sorting them according to their \n\ndensities. Particles having low settling rates will tend to drift offshore from the breaker zone, and this may \n\nresult in some degree of concentration of heavy minerals on the beach as a whole. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n189 \n \n\nThe model proposed by Kudrass (1987) invoke something of a \u2018\u2018sweeping\u2019\u2019 action of the waves, \n\nselectively pushing the heavy-minerals landward to concentrate them in the beach sands, depleting their \n\nconcentrations in the offshore shelf sands. Part of this sweeping action may result from the orbital motions of \n\nthe waves acting on the seafloor sand in the offshore, thus again in agreement with the results presented \n\nhere that indicate lower heavy mineral concentrations in the nearshore samples. \n\nIn samples where it was possible to conduct vertical analysis of variation in the percentage of heavy \n\nminerals in total sediment, the results disagree with Morton et al. (2008), who identified an overall upward \n\nincrease in heavy mineral laminations at some locations. In fact, samples from Salgados, Voe of Scatsta and \n\nStoneybridge present a clear pattern of decreasing the percentage of heavy minerals upwards in the high-\n\nenergy sediment unit, thus suggesting a decrease in energy associated with the event(s) responsible for \n\ntheir deposition and this is in total agreement with textural data. \n\nIn what concerns horizontal patterns, it was not possible to establish a clear variation in Boca do \n\nRio, whereas in Salgados a very slight decrease inland was identified. \n\nIn Boca do Rio, dune and beach are the more likely sources for the tsunamigenic deposit as \n\nillustrated in Figure 6.20 and 6.21. In the ternary plot diagram (andalusite, staurolite and tourmaline) all \n\nsamples exhibit compositional similarities although nearshore samples slightly differ from all others. This and \n\nthe results displayed in Figure 6.21 \u2013 showing strong similarities between dune and tsunami samples and \n\nprominent contrast with nearshore samples \u2013 clearly point to the establishment of dune as the most relevant \n\nsedimentary source of the tsunamigenic unit. Furthermore, the same pattern is highlighted in the principal \n\ncomponent analysis (Figure 6.22) that, once more, demonstrates the grouping of tsunami, beach and dune \n\nsamples and the differentiation from nearshore samples. \n\nIn fact, this result (dune as the main source of tsunamigenic sediment) is in agreement with \n\ninferences taken from the historical record (Silva Lopes, 1841) and geomorphological analysis (Oliveira et \n\nal., 2009) in Boca do Rio, where the erosion of the dunes by the AD 1755 tsunami and textural relations \n\nbetween aeolian and tsunami sediment in this location are further discussed. \n\nActually, Bahlburg and Spiske (2011) in their study of the sedimentary record of the February 2010 \n\ntsunami at Isla Mocha (Chile), observed that the tsunamigenic unit was produced essentially (i.e. >90%) by \n\nthe backflow. These authors suggest that due to the lack of sedimentary structures, many previous studies \n\nof modern tsunami sediments assumed that most of the detritus were deposited during inflow and an \n\nuncritical use of this assumption may lead to erroneous interpretations of palaeotsunami magnitudes and \n\nsedimentary processes, if unknowingly applied to backflow deposits. It is hypothesized by this work, that this \n\nstatement may apply to part of the previous studies focusing the AD 1755 deposit at Boca do Rio. Results \n\nobtained in this study suggest that in some locations of that lowland a signal from the backwash has been \n\npreserved and is still detectable in the heavy mineral assemblage of the tsunami sediment layer. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n190 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.19 \u2013 Principal component analysis of heavy mineral assemblage retrieved from Salgados.

However, in Boca do Rio, backwash \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n192 \n \n\nsignal is present in the heavy mineral assemblages due to lower content in staurolite and proportion of \u201cother \n\nminerals\u201d (suggesting seaward sediment input). \n\nThe comparison of our results with the data reported by Jagodzinski et al. (2009) - which also tried \n\nto compare tsunami deposits, beach sediments and pre-tsunami soils in Thailand \u2013 is limited by the \n\nconstrains associated with regional variance. While Jagodzinski et al. (2009) detected differences in the \n\nproportions of mica and tourmaline and attributed those differences to the mode of sediment transport and \n\ndeposition (with mica, due to its low density, being more abundant in the topmost part of the tsunami \n\ndeposit) on the assemblages studied in Salgados, Boca do Rio, Voe of Scatsta and Lhok Nga it was \n\npossible to associate variations in staurolite (Salgados and Boca do Rio) and in zircon and garnet \n\n(backwash Lhok Nga) \u2013 the denser minerals of the respective assemblages - to tsunamiites and those \n\nvariations are attributed to likely source and run-in and backwash interchange. \n\nIn Stoneybridge, the pattern that emerged was a robust decrease upward in terms of the heavy \n\nmineral percentage in total sediment, which is in agreement with the description by Mange and Wright \n\n(2007) for storm heavy mineral concentration. The assemblage remains stable although with minor and \n\nirregular percentage variations in garnet, pyroxenes and amphiboles, which are insufficient for \n\ninterpretations beyond inter-sample disparities. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n193 \n \n\n6.5.

Based \n\nin the cases studied in Portugal and in agreement with the data obtained in this study, it was possible to \n\nestablish specific criteria to differentiate a number of sedimentary environments (Table 6.4). However, \n\nlimitations on the number of representative samples and locations should be considered, this summary \n\nbeying a first approach that should be tested elsewhere. \n\nIt was concluded that alluvial samples tend to be more heterometric and poorly sorted when \n\ncompared with dune and beach samples. Alluvial samples also presented a richer heavy mineral \n\nassemblage in terms of \u201cother minerals\u201d indicating a different (inland) relevant source. \n\nOn the other hand, grains of beach sediment are more angular and present more abundant fresh \n\nsurfaces (both in the morphoscopic and microtextural analyses). By contrast, dune sediment yielded more \n\nrounded and spherical particles and present more adhering particles than beach samples. \n\nMason and Folk (1958) were able to distinguish beach, dune and aeolian flat sediments by size \n\nanalysis (using standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness of the grain size distributions). In their study case, \n\ndune and beach presented the lower and higher standard deviation, respectively, and these sedimentary \n\nenvironments were not distinguishable using kurtosis and skewness. The same authors also concluded that \n\nthere is a very high inter-location variation in size distribution parameters, that variation constraining some of \n\nthe conclusions. In the presented studied cases, textural analysis, by itself, did not allow a clear \n\ndifferentiation of sedimentary environments. \n\nThese results are partly in agreement with Shepard and Young (1961) (74 locations worldwide) that \n\ndemonstrated that dune sands are generally rounder, have a larger silt content and higher content in heavy \n\nminerals. If dune sands are more rounded than beach samples because of the abrasion between grains \n\nproduced during wind transportation, very little rounding would have occurred in transporting sand to the \n\nbordering dunes. That being the case it would be necessary to collect samples at considerable distances \n\ninland, within the dune field, in order to get appreciable differences. If, on the other hand, the principal \n\ndifference comes from the sorting action of the wind in picking up rounder grains from the beach, the \n\ndifference should be immediate. Beal and Shepard (1956) showed that there was no progressive change \n\nwith distance inland. \n\nShepard and Young (1961) concluded that a greater degree of roundness in dune samples in \n\nalmost all cases studied. 80% of sand grains in beach berms are more rounded than in the foreshore, either \n\nby action of wind or action of waves. They determined increasing roundness for beach, berm and dune. \n\nThese contrasting results reflect the high specific character of each group of samples, which should be \n\nreflected in caution when analysing the results from these proxies. In the field areas addressed in this study, \n\ndune grains, in agreement with Shepard and Young (1961), were more rounded inland and the berm \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n194 \n \n\npresented more angular particles. An increasing inland profile/trend in roundness was just about discernible \n\nin Salgados and in Boca do Rio the oldest dune (known as Roman dune, due to roman ruins that it covers) \n\npresented higher values for roundness and dissolution, thus suggesting longer periods subjected to \n\nmechanical and/or chemical processes, hence indicating an older age. \n\n According to the obtained results, nearshore samples should be divided in two groups: proximal \n\nand distal nearshore samples. The first group (situated between the closure depth and the surf zone) shares \n\nmany similarities with beach samples and, in the case of Boca do Rio grains from the latter were more \n\nangular than from the former. Distal nearshore samples (situated beyond the closure depth) presented \n\ntypically higher percentage of bioclasts, rounded grains with strong and abundant dissolution features and \n\nthe higher values for adhering particles. In fact, Samsuddin (1986) discussed a marked variation in size \n\ndistribution in the foreshore and breaker zone that occurs due to a variation in wave energy reaching the \n\npoint of sampling and extent of turbulence affecting this environment. The plunge point just seaward of the \n\nbackwash is considered as the point of maximum turbulence and high energy conditions. This zone is of \n\nprimary importance in forming the final sediment pattern in the beach environment. We argue that this \n\nplunge point correspond to the higher values for angularity and fresh surfaces that were observed in our \n\ngrains. Our conclusions are supported by Iversen (1951) that demonstrated that the internal motion of \n\nbreaking waves is a highly turbulent flow condition that is capable of keeping large amounts of particles in \n\nsuspension, which might justify an increase in collision between grains with consequent increase of \n\nangularity, mechanical marks and fresh surfaces. \n\n From the proxies tested in the present research it was able to apply morphoscopy, microtextural \n\nanalysis and heavy mineral assemblages as tools for sedimentary environment differentiation, although \n\ncaution should be used in the extrapolation of these results elsewhere. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n195 \n \n\n6.6. Single event signatures: the spatial contrast \n\nThe tsunami deposits of AD 1755 that accumulated along the Algarve coastline mostly consist of a \n\nlaterally extensive layer of shell-rich sand displaying an erosive base and a gradual and irregular upper \n\nboundary, which ramps and thins landwards. In some locations, the tsunami deposit is entirely composed of \n\nsand (e.g. Salgados). In other areas, the tsunami deposits are characterized by sand sheets containing \n\nisolated (also referred to as \u201cfloating\u201d) cobbles (e.g. Boca do Rio). \n\nThe Lagoa dos Salgados is actively accreting and this coastal depositional environment exhibits \n\nsignificant potential as a sedimentary archive of palaeoenvironmental changes that occurred throughout the \n\nHolocene. In this case, the data described above suggests that the lagoonal infill accumulated essentially \n\nafter 7000 Cal BP, in progressively lower-energy conditions, favoured by sheltering offered by the presence \n\nof a coastal barrier. Sediments of units A to C exhibit a neater marine signature when compared with the \n\ntopmost deposits of units D and F, which correspond to terrestrial-sourced, mud-dominated sedimentation \n\nthat persisted throughout the last ca. 1500 years across the whole lowland. This later sedimentation pattern \n\nwas disrupted by a unique event responsible for the deposition of unit E, a single laterally continuous and \n\nthin laminae of coarser material carrying abundant marine ecological proxies, which suggests a brief return \n\nto higher-energy conditions and marine sourced sedimentation, affecting most of the lowland. Although the \n\nLagoa dos Salgados is subject to occasional breaching of the barrier promoted by marine overwash, \n\nproviding water and sediment exchange with the ocean, the textural signature of these events is, at present, \n\nas it was in the recent past, confined to the inlet and flood shoals, where marine sand reaches the top of the \n\nstratigraphic column. Further inland and at a short lateral distance from the channel, the top sedimentary unit \n\nis solely represented by mud of unit F. \n\nWithin the upper mud-dominated units D and F (global thickness of 0.70-1.90 m) the conspicuous \n\nmedium sand lamina (unit E) occurs at ca. 0.40 m below the surface and consists essentially of quartz sand \n\nwith marine bivalve shell fragments and mud intraclasts (rip-up clasts). The thickness of this layer decreases \n\nfrom ca. 0.80 m close to the barrier to a few mm ca. 850 m at its landward limit, well beyond normal \n\noverwash, storm and tidal influence. \n\nThe sandy tsunami layer in Boca do Rio consisted of several distinct sub-units that vary greatly in \n\nboth vertical and horizontal sections. This unit is in contrast with the mud-dominated sedimentation of \n\nterrestrial source observed in the under and overlying units. The highly variable nature of the horizon \n\nappears to be due to rapid variation in the hydrodynamic characteristics of the depositional event (run-in, \n\nbackwash and periods mediating both processes where mud could settle) and diversity in source materials. \n\nThe tsunami deposit detectable at ca. 0.80 m below the surface wedges out and becomes discontinuous, \n\nbut it can be traced for more than 1 km inland. \n\nMapping of the laminae in Salgados suggests a wide, thin and fan-shaped feature, wedging out \n\nwithin the lagoonal basin, implying an exceptionally large inundation of marine origin. The erosive base \n\ntogether with the presence of rip-up clasts and grain size contrast with the framing sediment favours an \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n196 \n \n\nemplacement mechanism governed by an abrupt single high-energy marine inundation, rather than a \n\npositive increment in the sea level rise rate. \n\nThe spatial distribution of characteristics of sediment from unit E and the inferred vectorial properties \n\nof flow and associated sediment dispersion path are compatible with a massive inflow of marine water and \n\nsediment. This is in clear contrast with the outflow that must have followed the inundation and apparently \n\nfailed to leave a distinct sedimentary record. Moreover, the sedimentary signature of the inundation \n\ndemonstrates that the inflow path of water and sediment was essentially conveyed through the inlet rather \n\nthan extensive overtopping of the barrier, thus providing an objective limit to the maximum elevation of the \n\nwater level at the time of inundation. In the case of Boca do Rio, according to coeval sources (Pereira de \n\nSousa, 1919), the tsunami waves overtopped the existing foredune. 11-13 m for the elevation of tsunami \n\nwaves at the coast are mentioned, as well as the destruction of the large foredune by the incoming waves. A \n\ndetailed description of the effects of the backwash was also made, referring to the uncovering of Roman \n\nruins in the beach area. Since AD 1755, the coastal system has not been capable of rebuilding a robust \n\nforedune. \n\nThe comparison of the textural, morphoscopic, microtextural and heavy mineral assemblage of unit E \n\nfrom Salgados sediments and of possible sources, suggest that the coarser fraction of unit E was mainly \n\nderived from beach and dune sediments, whereas the underlying unit D may have contributed to the finer \n\nfractions. The beach comes out as a very likely source in terms of angularity and fresh surfaces of the \n\ngrains, whereas dunes are suggested as a major source by percussion marks and heavy mineral \n\nassemblages. Most probably both environments have contributed as primary and essential sources for \n\nmaterials washed inland and deposited as unit E. This is in line with Sato et al. (1995), who found that two \n\nJapanese tsunami deposits (1983 and 1993) were mainly sourced from the beach sediments, using limited \n\ntextural data. \n\nAs suggested by Goff et al. (1998; 2001) the shell richness is one of the attributes characterizing \n\ntsunami sediments, and a good marker of the high-energy involved in the sediment transport. In Lagoa dos \n\nSalgados, unit E is characterized by a sharp increase in the carbonate content associated with shells, mostly \n\nrepresented by fragments of thick-shelled marine bivalves. In Boca do Rio, within the tsunamigenic unit, the \n\nnannoplankton, foraminifera and ostracoda assemblages are diverse, containing a variety of predominantly \n\nmarine species (Hindson et al., 1996; Hindson and Andrade, 1999), which is in contrast with the \n\nassemblages observed for the under and overlying units, which were dominated by a small number of \n\nspecies that were able to tolerate the variable salinity conditions typical of estuarine and salt marsh \n\nenvironments. \n\nThe heavy mineral assemblage in places sampled at Boca do Rio might suggest incorporation of \n\nmaterial from backwash, although the massive facet of the deposit constrained the clear identification of sub-\n\nunits that could reinforce that conclusion. In the studied cases of Salgados and Boca do Rio, differences in \n\nheavy mineral assemblages of tsunamiites allows speculation about the relevance of the backwash \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n197 \n \n\nsedimentary contribution. In the case of Boca do Rio it may have been larger and probably fuelled by the \n\ngeomorphological setting \u2013 enclosed valley. In contrast, the wide flat area of Salgados lagoon apparently \n\ndismissed any relevant contribution of backwash deposition, which was not perceived in any of the proxies \n\nused. The influence of contrasting geomorphology of the accommodation space offered by both lowlands in \n\nwhat regards sedimentary signatures left  by the same flooding episode is further illustrated by Hindson and \n\nAndrade (1999) detailed stratigraphic analysis of the trenches excavated in Boca do Rio; they found a \n\ncomplex stratigraphy and interpreted that complexity as indicative of  more than one episode of \n\nsedimentation being represented within the tsunamigenic unit, at least in the more seaward portion of the \n\nlowland. Further inland, they remarked that the deposit was texturally more consistent, and transformed into \n\na single homogeneous sand layer, indicating that the processes of deposition were simpler. This is in clear \n\ncontrast with Salgados, where a more spatially consistent deposit (i.e. single sandy layer) was observed, \n\nsuggesting that the depositional story preserved in the sedimentary archive is proportionally simpler. \n\nThe likely source for the tsunami deposit is Boca do Rio has been discussed by other authors \n\n(Hindson et al., 1996; Hindson and Andrade 1999 and Oliveira et al., 2009) and all implied the dune as the \n\nmain sedimentary contributor for the tsunamiite. Our morphoscopic, textural, microtextural and heavy \n\nmineral results are in agreement with this, especially by demonstrating that nearshore was the unlikeliest \n\nsource and implying the dune as the main source (if not the only) relevant source. The backwash signal is \n\nrelevant, at least in some locations, and should deserve consideration in future studies. \n\nImmediately to the east of Salgados, in the Alcantarilha lowland, Dinis et al. (2010) observed \n\ngeomorphological features extending inland from the lee slope of the coastal dune ridge associated with the \n\ndeposition of a thining inland sandy layer that extended in the adjacent alluvial plain, and interpreted these \n\nfeatures as the result of a tsunami event;  due to its chronostratigraphic characteristics it can be correlated \n\nwith the same event responsible for the deposition of unit E in Lagoa dos Salgados (i.e. the AD 1755 \n\ntsunami). \n\nSimilarly, in Martinhal (immediately to the east of Sagres), the AD 1755 tsunami breached the \n\nbarrier and deposited an extensive sheet of sand. The tsunami origin for this deposit was supported by \n\nseveral features, such as incorporation  of rip-up clasts from the underlying layer, basal erosive contact and \n\ncontrast between increased content of marine Foraminifera in the tsunamigenic unit and the essentially \n\nbrackish assemblages yielded by the under and over lying layers (Kortekaas and Dawson, 2007). \n\nIn other areas of the Algarve sedimentary evidences of the AD 1755 deposits were also discussed \n\nby Andrade (1990, 1992) in Ria Formosa, central Algarve; and Costa et al. (2011) in Barranco and Furnas \n\n(east of Martinhal). In the case of Ria Formosa severe damage of the barrier chain and extensive overwash \n\nof two of the eastern barrier islands (Armona and Tavira) was detected. \n\nIn the Barranco and Furnas alluvial plains a group of uncommon size-range particles [0.3 - 1m (a-axis \n\ndiameter)] were observed a few hundred meters inland. The radiocarbon dates obtained from in situ \n\nendolithic bivalve shells suggested that transport was contemporary with the AD 1755 tsunami. \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n198 \n \n\nAlthough the documentary record indicates that the Algarve coast has been affected by other \n\ntsunamis in the last two millennia (Baptista and Miranda, 2009), no clear sedimentary record of their activity \n\nhas been found, until present. If the time window is extended further back, a single reference to a peculiar \n\nlayer, inferred as tsunamigenic and dated from ca. 6th century BC, was described by Schneider et al. (2009) \n\nin a central Algarve lowland. \n\nThe lack of correspondence between historical and sedimentary record of tsunami events in the \n\nLate Holocene can be attributed to: a) eventual predominance of erosional patterns, as discussed by \n\nSzczucinski (2011) in the case of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, thus inhibiting the preservation and \n\ndeposition of tsunamigenic signature; b) lack of textural contrast hindering distinction between tsunami and \n\nframing sediments; c) tsunami waves incapable of overtopping dunes, thus limiting their sedimentary \n\nsignature further inland of the coastline; d) extensive seaward shift in the location of the land-sea interface \n\npromoted by the forced regression that accompanied intensive silting of formerly drowned lowlands. \n\nThis study shows that the sedimentary signature recognized in unit E from Lagoa dos Salgados \n\nshares many stratigraphic and chronological characteristics with the nearby deposits detected in Boca do \n\nRio (and elsewhere in the Algarve), thus suggesting a regional and synchronous event as responsible for its \n\ndeposition. This conclusion is in agreement with the documentary record of this particular inundation in the \n\nAlgarve coast. The spatial characteristics of the tsunami layer at Lagoa dos Salgados suggests that the \n\nbarrier was effective in preventing extensive overtopping by the waves and this provides grounds to infer the \n\nmaximum elevation of the sea surface in this coastal stretch of ca. 10m at the time of inundation. \n\nA similar pattern was observed in Boca do Rio. The pre-existing dune was washed away by the AD 1755 \n\ntsunami waves (Silva Lopes, 1841). Based in historical records (Silva Lopes, 1841), archaeological data  \n\nand GIS-assisted geomorphological reconstructions (Oliveira et al., 2009) the estimated elevation of that \n\ndune is compatible with values obtained for Salgados (ca. 10m), thus indicating a similar tsunami wave \n\nheight at the coast between the two locations (separated by approximately 50 km). \n\nThe uniqueness of this record within the top low-energy sedimentary sequence lasting for about \n\n1500 years in Lagoa dos Salgados, Alcantarilha, Boca do Rio and elsewhere in Algarve lowlands might be \n\nused, with caution, to extrapolate a recurrence interval for similar high magnitude tsunami-borne inundations \n\nof this coast, suggesting that such interval may be of millennial scale. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n199 \n \n\n6.7. Multiple event signatures \n\nThe deposits studied here share many of the sedimentological diagnostic criteria of tsunamiites and \n\na summary is presented in Table 6.4. \n\nThe Salgados tsunamigenic unit is composed of medium to fine sand, contrasting markedly with the \n\nunderlying sediment and is separated from it by an unconformity. The tsunamiite in Salgados presents a \n\ndecreasing thickness inland up to its oblivion approximately 800 m from the present day coastline. This unit \n\npresents a strong lateral variance in terms of its sedimentary characteristics although it is commonly \n\nobserved as a massive sandy deposit with no identifiable laminations and without sedimentary structures.  \n\nNumerous mud rip-up clasts from the underlying unit were found in this unit. \n\nIn Boca do Rio the studied tsunamiite studied is present in the alluvial plain Holocene sequence, up \n\nto ca.1200 m from the coastline. The thickness of this unit also decreases inland. The study of this deposit \n\nrevealed a strong lateral variation and a complex sedimentological characterization. In some locations it was \n\npossible to differentiate sub-units within this unit, mainly in the seaward area. However, the sub-units \n\ndisappear inland and the deposit becomes a massive-like deposit before its wedging out inland. The lower \n\ncontact of this unit is erosive and it also showed very abundant broken shells of marine organisms, rip-up \n\nclasts and, in some locations, cobbles and boulders. \n\nThe tsunami sediments associated with the Storegga slide consist of fine or medium sand, often \n\ncontaining rip-up clasts both of organic material or peat. They basal contact is erosive and the unit has a \n\nmassive-like appearance even if cobbles could be observed within the unit. \n\nIn Lhok Nga the tsunamiite is composed of greyish to yellowish coarser to medium sand, with \n\nrelevant variations in thickness, grain-size and vertical trends. The contact between the tsunamigenic units \n\nand the underlying soil is abrupt or erosional. The thickness of the tsunami deposits varied and reached its \n\nmaximum values in the topographic lows. Lamination was visible and corresponded to distinct layers \n\nassociated with the sequence of run-in and backwash phases of successive tsunami waves. \n\nThe fact that different size-ranges were observed within the tsunamigenic unit might suggest that \n\nthe sediment material was transported through a combination of rolling, saltation and suspension. \n\nAge-estimation calculations allowed the association of the deposits observed in Salgados, Boca do \n\nRio and Voe of Scatsta with specific events that affected the Portuguese and Scottish coasts (AD 1755 \n\nLisbon tsunami and the Storegga Slide). The Lhok Nga deposit was associated with the 2004 Indian Ocean \n\ntsunami. \n\nCommon aspects to the occurrences briefly characterized above include an erosional/sharp basal \n\ncontact, thinning inland, fining upwards, the presence of rip-up clasts and a higher concentration of heavy \n\nminerals (decreasing upward) when compared with source material. These characteristics reflect the \n\nsuddenness of a unique high-energy marine inundation responsible for the deposition of the studied units. \n\nOne further pattern common to all deposits studied is that they may show contrasts in sediment texture, \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n200 \n \n\nvertical size-grading, thickness of the deposit, neatness of boundaries with over and underlying units, \n\npresence of transitional grading to the overlying sediments and other macroscopic features (e.g. alignment \n\nof prolate mud clasts, platy shell fragments  or whole valves embedded in sand, number of rip-up clasts at a \n\ncertain distance from the basal contact, \u201cfloating\u201d bouders or cobbles) in observation points located at very \n\nshort distances. This is more apparent in deposits showing more complex lithostratigraphic arrangements, \n\nwhich, in turn, may reflect, to some extent, entrapment of the inundation in semi-enclosed spaces, a feature \n\ndetermined by geomorphological constrains. \n\n Although sedimentological similarities between the different studied deposits were salient, several \n\ndifferences were noted. Only the deposit of Lhok Nga presented stratification/laminations distinctly \n\nseparating depositional entities, which were associated with the different waves and backwash. The other \n\ndeposits essentially revealed a massive aspect, which is probably associated with either depositional \n\nspecificity associated with turbulent flow or with the lack of conservation of the sedimentary structures, as \n\nreported to have been observed within a 5-year interval following the 2004 tsunami \u2013 see above. Related \n\nwith this is the presence of mud-drapes in the unit studied in Lhok Nga and their absence in the deposits of \n\nSalgados, Boca do Rio and Voe of Scatsta. The deposition and preservation of mud drapes on sand waves \n\nis favoured by a large sand-wave asymmetry, a high bottom concentration of suspended mud and large \n\ntime-velocity asymmetry (Allen, 1982) conditions that were likely registered in Lhok Nga but apparently did \n\nnot prevail in the other locations studied. \n\n Broken shells (of both macro and microscopic organisms) are a common presence in tsunami \n\ndeposits. In our studied cases, the tsunamiites revealed a significant occurrence of broken shells within the \n\nunits analysed and attributed to tsunamis. However, in the Voe of Scatsta samples macroscopically it was \n\nnot possible to observe the presence of shells within the deposit. \n\n In terms of grain size distribution all the massive-like deposits presented a unimodal distribution, \n\nwhile the Lhok Nga samples presented a bimodal distribution, thus representing a substancial difference in \n\nterms of source origin. In the case of Salgados, Boca do Rio and Voe of Scatsta the unimodal distribution is \n\nsimply explained by the similar grain-size characteristics of the possible source materials. \n\n Morphoscopic and microtextural imprints were discussed in detail in section 6.2.and 6.3. Some \n\nlocal specifies constrain extrapolations of the results, although they demonstrated the relevance of these \n\ntechniques in the differentiation of tsunamigenic units and in the establishment of their likely sedimentary \n\nsources. \n\n All tsunamiites studied revealed an increase in the percentage of heavy minerals and a decreasing \n\nupwards concentration of denser minerals. \n\n The establishment of source was possible for Salgados and Boca do Rio where it was clear that the \n\ntsunamigenic sediments share less similarities with both alluvial and nearshore materials and more \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n201 \n \n\n(morphoscopic, microtextural and heavy mineral assemblages) similarities with dune and beach deposits, \n\nthus suggesting the latter as the probable sedimentary source of the tsunamigenic units. \n\nTable 6.4 \u2013 Comparison of sedimentological features of the tsunamiites studied in this work. \n\nCriteria Salgados Boca do Rio Voe of Scatsta Lhok Nga \n\nAge AD 1755 AD 1755 ca. 8000 yrs BP AD 2004 \n\nBasal contact \nErosional/sharp/ \n\nunconformity \n\nErosional/ sharp/ \n\nunconformity \n\nErosional/sharp/ \n\nunconformity \n\nErosional/sharp/ \n\nunconformity \n\nMax. distance inland \n\n(deposit) \nca. 850m ca. 1500m ca. 1500m ca. 3500m \n\nStructure of unit Massive Massive Massive \nUnit with several \n\nlaminae \n\nThins inland Present Present Present Present \n\nSedimentary structures Not observed Not observed Not observed \n\nParallel \n\nlamination or \n\ncross-lamination \n\nMud-drapes Not observed Not observed Not observed Present \n\nRip-up clasts Present Present Present Present \n\nBroken shells Present Present Not observed Present \n\nGrain size distr.

Storm vs tsunami deposits \n\nTo compare tsunami and storm deposits it would be preferable to compare events and their \n\nsedimentological signatures in the same location. However, due to sedimentary and sampling constrains this  \n\nwas only possible in the case of Salgados, even though only one storm sample was studied in detail, it \n\nconstrains interpretations and precludes extrapolations. Though the limitations above, comparison was \n\npossible between the Stoneybridge storm samples and the tsunamiites of Salgados, Boca do Rio, Voe of \n\nScatsta and Lhok Nga (Table 6.5). Furthermore, the Salgados storm deposit was compared with the \n\ntsunamiite and present-day analogues retrieved from the same location. \n\nBoth tsunami and storm deposits can appear to be massive, lacking sedimentary structures, but \n\nmost storm deposits exhibit at least some sub-horizontal planar stratification (Schwartz, 1975; Morton 1978; \n\nLeatherman and Williams, 1983; Tuttle et al., 2004). Where present, the number of layers or lamina sets in \n\nboth tsunami and storm deposits depend partly on the thickness of the deposit. Both deposits studied at \n\nSalgados did not present lamination or differentiation in layers, thus revealing a more massive-like structure. \n\nIn the case of Stoneybridge and their comparison with tsunamiites, it was noted the absence of rip-up clasts \n\nand of broken shells in the former case, which was attributed to local characteristics. Another differentiator \n\nfactor was the presence of more angular and less spherical grains which could be ascribed to either \n\ncharacteristics of source sediment or to the energy and timing involved in the storm event. The latter \n\nassumption is valid if we consider that the rounding of grains is a process that requires longer time to be \n\ncompleted (in comparison with sharpening of edges \u2013 as previously discussed in section 6.2). Another factor \n\nthat allowed differentiation between storm and tsunami deposits was the distinct inland penetration in \n\nSalgados. The storm deposit is registered at shorter distances from the coast while the tsunami imprint \n\nextends for almost 1 km inland. It is quite plausible that the inland penetration distance of the \n\nsedimentological signatures of a large tsunami exceeds that of a storm when the same location (i.e. same \n\nmorphological constrains) and similar time windows (thus excluding significant changes in the above-\n\nmentioned constrains) are considered. It is however questionable if this contrast in dimension is a universal \n\ncriterium for distinction of storms and tsunami deposits. \n\nAt Stoneybridge the vertical variation of the storm deposit was observed with the presence of more \n\nbioclasts at top and base of the deposit (fact explained by the proximity with under and overlying layers). In \n\nfact, more lithic material was observed in the middle section of this deposit, which reflects more clearly the \n\nhigh-energetic character of the event and the sediment source. Moreover the grains revealed more angular \n\nfeatures and fresh surfaces, which is clearly related with the more energy involved and the possible higher \n\nsediment concentration. However, it is important to stress that the base of the unit presented low angularity \n\nvalues, possibly the result of long term action on the initially available sediment. The fact that percussions \n\nmarks were present in a reduced percentage is most likely related with source characteristics. \n\nThe tempestite grains in the Stoneybridge deposit were mostly sub-discoid and spherical grains \n\nwere nearly absent and the percentage of heavy minerals decreases to top, which is a common aspect of \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n204 \n \n\nstorm deposits (Mange and Wright, 2007). Moreover, it was also observed a decrease in the percentage of \n\n\u201cother (heavy) minerals\u201d towards the top which might reflect the decreasing capacity of transportation or, \n\nmore probably, the selective transport of heavy minerals (which was discussed in section 6.4). \n\nIn Salgados the fact that only one possible tempestite sample was used in this study limits some \n\nanalysis and interpretations. Results obtained in this case show that the tempestite presented lowest \n\npercentage of bioclasts compared with both the tsunami and possible source materials. Hence, the storm \n\ndeposit present the highest percentage (ca. 80%) of quartz, followed by tsunami (75%-55%) and present-\n\nday analogues (<60%). The tempestite in Salgados shared many similarities with beach samples, such as \n\nthe lower percentage of well-rounded grains and high content in discoid grains, although it presented similar \n\nvalues to tsunami grains in terms of angularity and percussion marks. The storm deposit in Salgados \n\npresented high percentage of heavy minerals (higher than possible sources but lower than tsunami \n\nsamples), a maximum value for staurolite (densest mineral of the assemblage) - which was followed by the \n\nrest of tsunami samples. Furthermore, it also presented the lowest value for tourmaline (similarly to tsunami \n\nsamples). These heavy mineral features are indicative of similarities between the two events (i.e. storm and \n\ntsunami) even though tsunamis seem to present a higher concentration of heavy minerals probably due to \n\ntheir higher transport energy (i.e. higher turbulence of the flow). \n\n \n\nTable 6.5 \u2013 Sedimentological characteristics of storm deposits from Salgados and Stoneybridge and their differentiation \nfrom tsunami deposits. \n\nCriteria Salgados Stoneybridge \nDifferences to tsunami \n\ndeposits \n\nStratigraphical \n\nErosional abrupt contact \n\nMassive unit without \n\nlaminations \n\nNo rip-up clasts \n\nBroken shells \n\nThins inland \n\nErosional basal  contact \n\nMassive unit lacking laminations \n\nNo rip-up clasts \n\nBroken shells \n\nNo vertical grain-size trend \n\nNo lateral variations \n\nLess extension inland \n\nAbsence of rip-up clasts \n\nTextural No clear differentiator No clear differentiator No clear differentiator \n\nMorphoscopic No clear differentiator \n\nMore bioclasts in base and top \n\nMore lithic \u2013 middle of unit \n\nMore angular \n\nMostly sub-discoid; spherical \n\nnearly absent \n\nNo clear differentiator \n\nMicrotextural \nMore similar to beach \n\nHigh percussion marks \n\nBase of unit lower values of \n\nangularity \n\nFresh higher in mid dep \n\nHB -Low percussion marks \n\n(source-related) \n\nLower frequency of \n\npercussion marks \n\nHeavy \n\nminerals \n\nIncrease in heavy mineral \n\npercentage \n\nSalgados more Staurolite \n\n% of heavy minerals decreases to \n\ntop \n\nLess \u201cother minerals\u201d to the top \n\nHigher percentage of HM \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n205 \n \n\n7. Conclusions \n\n \n\n7.1. Achievements and future work \n\nNumerous studies of sediments recording extreme marine inundations have aimed to characterize \n\nand distinguish such sedimentary materials, thus contributing to extend the available database on coastal \n\ninundation further back in time, well beyond the historical record, and also estimate event recurrence. This \n\nwork further contributed to these objectives by focusing on the application of textural, morphoscopic, \n\nmicrotextural and compositional analysis and features, to identify deposits of extreme marine inundations \n\nand their likely source materials. The work presented here results from a variety of locations (Salgados and \n\nBoca do Rio - Portugal; Lhok Nga \u2013 Indonesia; Voe of Scatsta and Stoneybridge - Scotland) and considers \n\nevents of different chronologies and sources (AD 1755, 26 December 2004 and the Storegga Slide \n\ntsunamis; the Great Storm of 11 January 2005) that affected contrasting coastal settings with different \n\nregional oceanographic conditions. \n\nThe methods used on samples from the studied sites were: lithostratigraphic interpretation, grain-\n\nsize analysis and interpretation of size-distribution patterns; morphoscopic characterization of selected \n\nparticle populations under the microscope; microtextural characterization of quartz grains using Scanning \n\nElectron Microscope imagery and study of heavy mineral assemblages. \n\nThe storm and tsunami deposits studied consisted of essentially sand-sized sediment. The typical \n\nlithostatigraphic setting of these peculiar deposits is of one high-energy layer or laminae sandwiched within \n\nlow-energy sediment, presenting an abrupt basal contact, thinning and fining inland until wedging out within \n\nthe low-energy materials, which correspond to the signature of the permanent sedimentation regime. \n\nTsunami deposits typically exhibited a noticeable lateral variation in all sedimentary and geometric features, \n\neven at short distances, and all presented a massive internal structure, with the exception of the most recent \n\nevent (2004 tsunami and deposit in Lhok Nga \u2013 Indonesia). \n\nResults obtained from the morphoscopic study of sand-sized particles (e.g. roundness and shape) \n\nindicate that in Salgados (Portugal), Boca do Rio (Portugal) and Lhok Nga, these attributes are useful in \n\ndiscriminating coastal sedimentary environments and/or in the establishment of likely source material for \n\nmaterials deposited by extreme marine inundations. For instance, in Salgados it was clear both through the \n\ncompositional pattern, as well as considering sphericity, that the nearshore samples share the less affinity \n\nwith the tsunamiite samples. \n\nResults from grain surface microtextural analysis revealed that this proxy is a valuable \n\ncomplementary sedimentological technique to be applied in the discrimination of coastal sedimentary \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n206 \n \n\nenvironments and is relevant in the identification of extreme marine inundation deposits, especially when \n\nconsidered within the regional sedimentological and geomorphological context. Tsunami- and storm-\n\ntransported grains presented a more frequent surface reworking by percussion marks and fresh surfaces \n\nwhen compared with potential source materials and with grains representing present-day active coastal \n\ndepositional environments. Heavy mineral assemblages were typically site-specific. Generally, the \n\nconcentration of heavy minerals in total sediment decreases up-unit in the high-energy layer and, in one of \n\nthe studied sites (Salgados, southern Portugal) the content in heavy minerals (e.g. staurolite) presented \n\nqualitative and quantitative similarities with dune samples. In that case, it was also possible to use heavy \n\nmineral assemblages to differentiate tsunami and storm deposits. In Lhok Nga (Indonesia) and Boca do Rio \n\n(Portugal) it was also possible to identify a mineralogical signature specific of the tsunami backwash. \n\nThe recognition of the same sedimentary signature of the AD 1755 tsunamigenic event, in several \n\nlowlands of the Algarve coast of Portugal and its integration in the sedimentary history preserved in its long-\n\nterm sedimentary archive provides grounds to suggest a millennial-scale time for the return period of this \n\ntype of events, with similar intensity, in this region. However, constrains on our present-day ability to pick \n\nand identify all the geological evidences of extreme marine inundations in the sedimentary record (e.g. \n\nassociated with preservation of deposit, existence of lithological and textural contrasts, etc.) need to be \n\nfurther addressed to establish return periods more confidently. Similarities between deposits studied in \n\nSalgados and Boca do Rio were compiled and facilitated interpretations at a regional scale. Differentiation \n\nbetween tsunami and storm deposits was evidenced by the incorporation of rip-up clasts in tsunamigenic \n\ndeposits while they were absent in the storm deposits analysed. Furthermore, the dimensions and strong \n\nlateral variation in features of tsunamigenic units was in strong contrast with the smaller size and more \n\nconsistent spatial distribution of sedimentary features within storm-deposited sedimentary units. \n\nOverall results revealed that site-specific effects precluded clear-cut extrapolations on a storm vs \n\ntsunami emplacement mechanism of worldwide application, although they demonstrated that the use of \n\nmultiple proxies, such as textural, morphoscopic, microtextural and compositional, data, enhances the \n\npossibility of using sedimentological criteria to recognize and differentiate tsunami from storm deposits and, \n\nin both cases, determine source-deposits relations, if the regional context is sufficiently constrained. \n\n The initial goals established for this thesis were achieved: \n\na) Coastal sediments deposited by Holocene extreme marine inundations were identified, \n\ndescribed, characterized, dated and related with single high-energy events of abrupt marine inundation; \n\nb) Sediment exposures and samples were analysed using a multidisciplinary and multi-proxy \n\napproach that included characterization and interpretation of lithostratigraphic, geometric, dimensional, \n\ntextural, microtextural and compositional features of the sediment, addressed at contrasting spatial scales \n\n(ranging from the scale of the outcrop or sedimentary column to the ultramicroscopic imagery of single \n\nparticles) to achieve an interpretation  of processes controlling the entrainment, transport and deposition of \n\nterrigenous sediment during high-energy single events of coastal flooding; \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n207 \n \n\nc) Textural and microtextural analysis was applied in order to establish the source material or/and \n\nto identify specific signatures of extreme marine inundations in coastal sediments; \n\nd) The value of heavy mineral assemblages in coastal sediments in establishing source materials \n\nor/and in building compositional signatures specific of extreme marine inundations was tested with \n\nencouraging results; \n\ne) Return periods for extreme marine inundations (i.e. tsunamis) were conjectured for the Algarve \n\ncoast of Portugal; \n\nf) Overall, this thesis contributed to the development of the current knowledge on criteria used to \n\ncharacterize sediments deposited by high-energy events of coastal flooding, such as tsunamis and storms, \n\nand to increase our ability to distinguish deposits related with each type of oceanographic forcing. This is \n\nespecially true in what regards the study of factors controlling microtextural features imprinted in the surface \n\nof quartz grains and the value of those features in reconstructing the nature and energy-level of the transport \n\nagent. \n\n \n\nThe work presented in this thesis, although contributing to the enhancement of sedimentological \n\ncriteria presently available to recognize and differentiate extreme marine inundation deposits, revealed areas \n\nwhere additional research should be conducted in order to better understand the complex processes \n\ninvolved in extreme marine inundations and how they translate into the sediment. In fact, additional and \n\nmore detailed provenance studies should be conducted with the purpose of establishing tsunami- and storm-\n\ndeposit sedimentary sources and, through this, improve understanding on the physical and sedimentary \n\nmechanisms of extreme marine inundations. For instance, the backwash process and its influence in the \n\narrangement of tsunamigenic units, is at the present state of knowledge, scarcely understood. To conduct \n\nthese studies the widespread use of microtextural and heavy mineral analysis on samples obtained from \n\nboth observed and fossil deposits is recommended; revisiting classic reference locations and deposits, such \n\nas the ones of Boca do Rio (Portugal) or Voe of Scatsta (Scotland), re-sampling and re-interpreting these \n\n\u201cclassical\u201d deposits incorporating the developments achieved on backwash signatures learned from the \n\nSumatra and Japan events may result in significant advances in the comprehension of the geological record. \n\nFurthermore, the increase in the number of research sites will facilitate generalization of conclusions and \n\nperception on which proxies or features may be used independently of regional to local specificities; thus \n\ndiminishing the influence of site-specific constrains that normally (at the present state of knowledge) \n\nmodulate inferences obtained from the study of extreme marine inundations departing from the geological \n\narchive. These approaches will provide more tools and data to comprehend depositional and erosional \n\nprocesses involved in tsunami and storm sediment flow and transport. \n\nIn some cases, where tsunami or storms present significant sedimentary erosive patterns (volume \n\nof sediment remobilized exceeding the total volume of the sediment unit inland) it would be challenging and \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n208 \n \n\ninnovative to focus on the sediment deposited at the nearshore area, beyond the closure depth, where some \n\nof these deposits are most probably immobilized and in a state of \u201cnon-equilibrium\u201d with the prevailing \n\noceanographic conditions; if that section of the inner shelf is accreting, the potential of a short core \n\ncontaining record of multiple events is high. \n\nIn this study no major differences between tsunami deposits caused by different origins (i.e \n\nearthquake and landslide) were detected. However, further studies should address this issue with the \n\nambitious aim of increasing our ability to distinguish sedimentary columns containing multiple events \n\ngenerated by the same source (even if separated in space) from sections containing signatures of multiple-\n\nsource events, both cases being of different significance in geodynamic and hazard terms. Furthermore, the \n\nrelationship between distant and local tsunami origins will most probably (at least, at a regional scale) be \n\nreflected in the tsunami deposit. The application and development of more accurate age-estimation \n\ntechniques (direct or indirect) will also facilitate the establishment of return periods of extreme marine \n\ninundations with obvious positive consequences for the study and assessment of hazard/risk for any specific \n\ncoastal area. It is essential that future research contributes to the increase of the accuracy of the \n\nsedimentological criteria to recognize and differentiate sedimentary products laid down by extreme marine \n\ninundations. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSedimentological signatures of extreme marine inundations \n\n \n\n209 \n \n\nReferences \n\nAbe, K., (1979) Size of earthquakes inferred from tsunami data.
