The coins were analyzed using ?-Energy \n\nDispersive X-ray Fluorescence in order to evaluate their elemental composition, \n\nallowing to confirm in four of the coins a billon alloy (copper/silver) and in the \n\nremaining two a reduced content of silver. This fact is compatible with the social and \n\neconomic Portuguese reality during D. Fernando I reign. The coins were further \n\nevaluated by means of X-ray Diffraction identifying natives copper and silver, as well \n\nas some of their degradation products, such as cuprite, tenorite, malachite, nantokite and \n\natacamite and on the numisms with high silver content, chlorargyrite. By making use of \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy the morphological \n\nanalysis on the coins surface was performed evidencing the corroded surface and \n\nallowing to identify different morphologies corresponding to copper/copper oxides and \n\nsilver/silver chloride phases.  \n\nOn the second part, several calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium hydroxide \n\nfunctionalized nanoparticles were synthesized, purified and physicochemical \n\ncharacterized, in order to study their application by dispersion, on manuscripts and its \n\nsimilar for conservation purposes. The effect of different percentages of the \n\nfunctionalizing agent (dodecanoic acid) was investigated. Results from the visual and \n\nturbidimetry analyses showed that the dispersions were not stable for the proposed end. \n\nBy making use of Attenuated Total Reflectance and X-ray Diffraction was possible to \n\nconclude that the acid is present on the final CaCO3 product. Scanning Electron \n\nMicroscopy allowed to prove the morphological changes on the powders particles and \n\nmade clear the shortage of nano-objects. The followed route is not effective regarding \n\nthe synthesis of nanoparticles which may justify the instability of the dispersions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words: corrosion, coins, nanoparticles, XRF, XRD, SEM/EDS, turbidimetry, \n\nATR \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nv  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nEste trabalho \u00e9 composto por duas partes distintas mas complementares e que \n\ndiferem apenas na base em estudo. Abrangem-se assim dois dos campos fundamentais \n\nno estudo do patrim\u00f3nio cultural, nomeadamente, a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do estado de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde um conjunto de moedas antigas, seguido pela proposta de um m\u00e9todo para a \n\npreserva\u00e7\u00e3o do papel e seus similares.  \n\n \n\nA primeira parte da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o foca-se na an\u00e1lise de um conjunto de seis \n\ndinheiros datados da primeira dinastia Portuguesa (s\u00e9culos XIII e XIV), particularmente \n\ndos reinados de D. Sancho II (1223-1248); D. Afonso III (1248-1279); D. Dinis \n\n(1279-1325); D. Pedro I (1357-1367) e D. Fernando I (1367-1383). Este trabalho \n\nbaseia-se na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do estado de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o dos numismas, por meio da \n\nidentifica\u00e7\u00e3o e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos produtos que constituem a sua patina bem como as \n\naltera\u00e7\u00f5es morfol\u00f3gicas a que a sua superf\u00edcie esteve sujeita devido \u00e0 sua intera\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\no ambiente circundante. Tenta-se ainda propor um mecanismo de corros\u00e3o por\u00e9m \n\ndevido \u00e0 falta de informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o local da descoberta, o estado do enterro/desenterro \n\nou mesmo das datas relacionadas com qualquer um destes processos, esta investiga\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\num desafio tanto a n\u00edvel do estudo da sua camada de corros\u00e3o como a n\u00edvel do \n\npatrim\u00f3nio cultural.  \n\nDe salientar que os dinheiros foram as primeiras moedas portuguesas, cunhadas \n\nem liga de bolh\u00e3o (maioritariamente constitu\u00edda por cobre, seguido de prata e alguns \n\nelementos qu\u00edmicos minorit\u00e1rios). Estas moedas estiveram em circula\u00e7\u00e3o, em Portugal, \n\ndesde meados do s\u00e9culo XII at\u00e9, aproximadamente, 1502. Mais ainda, patina \u00e9 a camada \n\nque reveste a superf\u00edcie do metal, no seu estado puro ou em liga, sendo constitu\u00edda por \n\ntodos os compostos qu\u00edmicos, nomeadamente produtos de corros\u00e3o e outros elementos \n\nex\u00f3genos formados e mantidos na superf\u00edcie do objeto, alterando a sua cor e textura. \n\nUrge considerar o sistema liga/patina/ambiente como um sistema global, em que a \n\npatina resulta das intera\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas entre a liga e o ambiente, ao longo do \n\ntempo.  \n\nA a\u00e7\u00e3o combinada de t\u00e9cnicas anal\u00edticas n\u00e3o destrutivas como a espectrometria de \n\nmicro-Fluoresc\u00eancia de raios-X de Energia Dispersiva (?-EDXRF), a Difra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nraios-X (XRD) e a Microscopia Eletr\u00f3nica de Varrimento acoplada com a t\u00e9cnica de \n\nEspectroscopia Dispersiva de raios-X (SEM/EDS) permitem identificar a natureza dos \n\nprodutos da patina formados no conjunto de moedas estudadas, contribuindo para \n\ncompreender e preservar a hist\u00f3ria das sociedades e ajudar \u00e0 preserva\u00e7\u00e3o dos mesmos. \n\nDo ponto de vista macrosc\u00f3pico e por meio de an\u00e1lise visual p\u00f4de concluir-se que, de \n\num modo geral, as superf\u00edcies das moedas se encontravam bem definidas e preservadas, \n\ndado o seu per\u00edodo de origem. Todas as moedas apresentavam uma colora\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npreta-acastanhada e, em alguns casos, uma colora\u00e7\u00e3o acobreada nas zonas de \n\nalto-relevo. Exce\u00e7\u00e3o feita \u00e0 face de uma das moedas que apresentou, pontualmente, \n\nsinais t\u00edpicos de corros\u00e3o do tipo \u201ccouve-flor\u201d. V\u00e1rios tipos de patinas foram \n\nidentificados, a saber uma camada amarelo-acastanhado nas \u00e1reas de baixo-relevo e, \n\nlocalmente, colora\u00e7\u00f5es verde (baixo-relevo) e vermelho-acastanhado (cobrindo a \n\nsuperf\u00edcie) em todas e/ou alguns dos numismas.  \n\nAs moedas foram analisadas usando ?-EDXRF de modo a quantificar a sua \n\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o elementar. Com recurso a esta t\u00e9cnica foi poss\u00edvel proceder \u00e0 confirma\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda liga de bolh\u00e3o em todas as moedas notando-se por\u00e9m uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o do teor de prata \n\n\n\nv i  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nnas duas moedas datadas do reinado de D. Fernando I. Este facto \u00e9 comprovado pela \n\nrealidade social e econ\u00f3mica \u00e0 \u00e9poca, onde era j\u00e1 conhecida a deprecia\u00e7\u00e3o do metal. Por \n\nmeio da t\u00e9cnica de XRD foi poss\u00edvel identificar cobre (Cu), prata (Ag) e chumbo (Pb) \n\nnativos bem como alguns dos seus produtos de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o, nomeadamente cuprite \n\n(Cu2O), tenorite (CuO), malaquite (Cu2CO3(OH)2), nantoquite (CuCl) e atacamite \n\n(Cu2Cl(OH)3) e, nos dinheiros com teor de prata mais elevado, cloroargirite (AgCl). As \n\nmoedas foram ainda analisadas com recurso \u00e0 t\u00e9cnica SEM/EDS tendo sido poss\u00edvel \n\nobservar a morfologia das suas superf\u00edcies. Estas apresentav\u00e3o sinais caracter\u00edsticos de \n\ncorros\u00e3o tendo sido identificadas, maioritariamente, fases ricas em cobre/\u00f3xidos de \n\ncobre e prata/cloreto de prata.  \n\nA intera\u00e7\u00e3o ente o ambiente e o material met\u00e1lico tornou-se assim evidente \n\npermitindo assinalar a presen\u00e7a de elementos ex\u00f3genos \u00e0 liga, tais como sil\u00edcio, cloro, \n\nc\u00e1lcio, f\u00f3sforo, pot\u00e1ssio, e, possivelmente, ferro e merc\u00fario. Os resultados de ?-EDXRF \n\npermitiriam ainda avan\u00e7ar para a poss\u00edvel constitui\u00e7\u00e3o da liga atrav\u00e9s da identifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde cobre e prata, bismuto, ouro e, provavelmente, antim\u00f3nio, chumbo e ferro como parte \n\ndo min\u00e9rio. A evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da camada de corros\u00e3o pode ser assumida como tendo in\u00edcio \n\naquando da forma\u00e7\u00e3o da cuprite e, em concord\u00e2ncia com a interface metal/meio, a sua \n\nconsequente convers\u00e3o noutros compostos qu\u00edmicos. O significativo teor de i\u00e3o cloreto \n\n(Cl\n-\n) registado, quer atrav\u00e9s das t\u00e9cnicas de an\u00e1lise elementar quer pela identifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos seus produtos de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o (CuCl, AgCl e Cu2Cl(OH)3), pode indicar a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\na um ambiente marinho (rico em i\u00f5es Cl\n-\n). Estes resultados s\u00e3o compat\u00edveis com a \n\ngeografia costeira de Portugal. Mais ainda, os i\u00f5es Cl\n-\n induzem geralmente um processo \n\nde corros\u00e3o autocatal\u00edtica em artefactos ricos em cobre, o que pode explicar o facto de \n\nduas das moedas com teores de Cl\n-\n mais elevados, serem aquelas que apresentam \n\nmaiores sinais de corros\u00e3o. Finalmente \u00e9 importante notar que outros produtos de \n\npatina, como por exemplo compostos amorfos, nomeadamente, outros \u00f3xidos, fosfatos \n\nou sulfatos, poder\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m estar presentes na superf\u00edcie das moedas.  \n\n \n\nA segunda parte do presente trabalho tem como base a s\u00edntese, purifica\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmica de v\u00e1rias nanopart\u00edculas de carbonato de c\u00e1lcio (CaCO3) e \n\nhidr\u00f3xido de c\u00e1lcio (Ca(OH)2) funcionalizadas com \u00e1cido dodecano\u00edco (DA), com o \n\nobjetivo de estudar a sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o, por dispers\u00e3o, em manuscritos e seus similares com \n\no prop\u00f3sito da sua conserva\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nO efeito de diferentes percentagens de agente funcionalizante bem como diversos \n\nsolventes org\u00e2nicos apolares e as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de realiza\u00e7\u00e3o das dispers\u00f5es foram \n\nestudados; tendo-se conclu\u00eddo que o solvente que apresentou os resultados mais \n\nsatisfat\u00f3rios foi o ciclohexano, quando sujeito ao maior n\u00famero de ciclos ultrass\u00f3nicos \n\naplicados. Por outro lado os resultados da an\u00e1lise visual e da turbidimetria, t\u00e9cnicas \n\nusadas para avaliar a estabilidade das dispers\u00f5es, mostraram que estas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o est\u00e1veis \n\npara o fim proposto uma vez que as dispers\u00f5es obtidas se demonstraram inst\u00e1veis por \n\num per\u00edodo de tempo estipulado de 18 h a 24 h. Embora o ciclohexano tenha sido o \n\nsolvente que apresentou os resultados mais promissores outros solvents, al\u00e9m dos \n\nestudados, deveriam ser testados. Com base nestes resultados, os estudos seguintes \n\nforam realizados apenas para os p\u00f3s de CaCO3 compostos por percentagens de 0.0% e \n\n5.0% de DA.  \n\nCom recurso \u00e0s t\u00e9cnicas de Reflet\u00e2nica Total Atenuada (ATR) e XRD \n\nverificou-se a presen\u00e7a do \u00e1cido no produto final de CaCO3 funcionalizado com 5.0% \n\nde DA. Mais ainda, por combina\u00e7\u00e3o dos resultados de ambas as pr\u00e1ticas foi poss\u00edvel \n\nidentificar calcite e aragonite no produto sem funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o (0.0% DA), ao passo que, \n\nno produto hidrof\u00f3bico (5.0% DA) foram identificadas fases relativas \u00e0 calcite, vaterite \n\n\n\nv i i  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\ne aragonite bem como do sal do \u00e1cido carbox\u00edlico (Ca(C12H23O2)2). Finalmente, o SEM \n\npermitiu observar altera\u00e7\u00f5es morfol\u00f3gicas resultantes da introdu\u00e7\u00e3o do agente \n\nfuncionalizante bem como provar a n\u00e3o exist\u00eancia de nanopart\u00edculas. Em qualquer um \n\ndos p\u00f3s obtidos a car\u00eancia de nanomateriais tornou-se evidente tendo sido poss\u00edvel \n\nidentificar aquilo que parecem ser clusters de nano-objectos.  \n\nA reduzida quantidade de nanopart\u00edculas provocou uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o dr\u00e1stica no \n\nn\u00famero de part\u00edculas pass\u00edveis de dispers\u00e3o pois devido ao seu tamanho, estas n\u00e3o t\u00eam \n\ncapacidade de penetrar (t\u00e3o) profundamente no interior da superf\u00edcie do papel \n\ntornando-se pouco eficazes contra a acidez interna da base. Pode assim concluir-se que \n\na rea\u00e7\u00e3o, segundo as condi\u00e7\u00f5es espec\u00edficas aplicadas, embora eficaz na produ\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\np\u00f3s sintetizados se mostrou pouco eficiente para produzir nanopart\u00edculas, justificando \n\nassim a instabilidade das dispers\u00f5es obtidas.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n

Investigations involving chemical and physical \n\nnon-destructive instrumental methods contribute greatly to understand and preserve the \n\nhistory of societies.  \n\nThe present work will be presented in two separate but complementary parts. The first \n\napproach (Evaluation on the degradation state of antique coins by spectroscopic techniques) \n\nis based on the assessment on the conservation state of antique Portuguese coins by \n\nidentification and understanding of its corrosion products and surface morphologic changes. \n\nWhile the second part (Development of nanomaterials for Cultural Heritage Conservation) is \n\nresult of the synthesis, purification and physical-chemistry characterization of several calcium \n\ncarbonate (CaCO3) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) nanoparticles hydrophobically \n\nfunctionalized with dodecanoic acid (DA), to application on manuscripts for conservation \n\npurpose.  \n\nIn consequence the two main fields on the study of cultural heritage are covered: the \n\ninvestigation on the state of conservation of an object and a proposal to a conservation mode. \n\nIn this particular case the studied objects are different but the approach is highlighted. \n\nAnnexe I presents a list of important definitions and concepts that are going to be use \n\non this work.  \n\n1.1 COINS \n\nCoins are particular and important findings during archaeological investigations as \n\nsource of documentation, understanding and knowledge of people and their societies.  \n\nOnce these objects play an important role in any national cultural heritage, this study \n\nrepresents a very important step in the first Portuguese dynasty billon coins characterization. \n\nIt is focus on a set of six dinheiros dated from the 13\nrd\n\n and 14\nth\n\n centuries, namely from \n\nD. Sancho II (1223-1248); D. Afonso III (1248-1279); D. Dinis (1279-1325); D. Pedro I \n\n(1357-1367) and D. Fernando I (1367-1383). Due to the limited knowledge, in particular the \n\nlack of information about the place of find, state of burial/dig up or even its related dates (the \n\nnumisms could have been buried, submerged or even exposed to other kind of environments) \n\nthis investigation is a challenge on both corrosion science and cultural heritage. Is thus \n\n\n\n \n\n2  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\njustified the importance of a detailed analysis in order to gain intensive information about \n\nchemical composition, nature of the patina and corrosion features on the coins.  \n\n1.1.1 Coin history and social impact \n\nThe invention of coins resumes to the 650/700 b.C. and since that time they have been \n\nused as a medium of exchange. These metal objects are standardized in weight and produced \n\nin large quantities at a mint (coinage house).  \n\nNumismatics\n1\n and the study of the coins\u00b4 chemical composition (surface and bulk) give \n\nimportant information about the culture, economy and science of a society [1, 2, 3]. For \n\nexample, the study on the coin depreciation (by reducing the precious metal content) can be \n\ncorrelated to the economic decline as evidence on periods of economic difficulties [4, 5].  \n\nPortuguese dinheiros  \n\nPortugal's independence was proclaimed by D. Afonso Henriques on 25 July 1139, \n\nbeing the first Portuguese coins (dinheiros) issued by him. Dinheiros (minted in billon alloy) \n\nwere the currency of Portugal from the late 12\nnd \n\ncentury until, approximately, 1502.  \n\nVarious kinds of coins were introduced in the Portuguese culture during the first \n\ndynasty. Around 1200, a gold currency was produced and a century later a silver coin was \n\nintroduced [6].  \n\nThe set of the studied dinheiros, their respective kingdom, date, schematic figures and \n\nthe mint houses are presented on Table 1.1.  \n\nTable 1.1 - Set of the studied dinheiros and its respective kingdom and date, schematic figures and mint houses [1, 7]. \n\n# King Date Dinheiro Legend Mint \n\n4\nth\n D.

Sancho II known as the \u201cCowled One\u201d was born in Coimbra, in 1209, and his death \n\nis reported to 1248 in exile (Toledo). He ascended to the throne in 1223 and was deposed by \n\nthe Holy See due his political and personal ideas, in 1245. Sancho II introduced a great \n\ndevelopment in minting once the coinage necessity grew due the increasing of the commercial \n\ntransactions [1].  \n\nThe \u201cBolognese\u201d or D. Afonso III became king of Portugal in 1248. He was born in \n\nCoimbra (1212) and died in Lisbon (1279). Afonso III extended his domain conquering the \n\nsouthward to Algarve and gave Portugal its definitive boundaries. This king produced several \n\nlegislation regulating minting alloys, weights and alterations in coins [1]. \n\nD. Dinis, the \u201cHusbandman\u201d, was born in Lisbon in 1261, ascended to the throne in \n\n1279, and died in Santar\u00e9m in 1325. During his time, the land was colonized and cultivated; \n\nindustry grew stronger and the external commerce expanded protected by an organized navy \n\nand defended by treaties and protective laws [1]. With D. Dinis the first Portuguese university \n\n(\u201cEstudo Geral\u201d) was established in Lisbon (1290) being later transferred to Coimbra (1308) \n\n[8]. As a consequence, Latin gave way to Portuguese language and started to be used on \n\nofficial documents and diplomas.  \n\nD. Pedro I known as the \u201cJust\u201d or the \u201cCruel\u201d was born in 1320 (Coimbra), died in 1367 \n\n(Estremoz) and acceded to the throne by death of his father (D. Afonso IV) in 1357. During \n\nhis reign the economic situation of the country improved and prospered. Despite its political \n\ninternal instability, trade was carried on the most important ports of Europe [1]. \n\nD. Fernando I known as the \u201cHandsome\u201d (Coimbra, 1345 \u2013 Lisbon, 1383) ascended to \n\nthe throne in 1367 being the last king of the first Portuguese dynasty. Fernando I was \n\ninvolved in unending and unprofitable wars against the Castile which created enormous \n\neconomic and financial difficulties. In fact, the coinage reflected his irregular and dissolvent \n\nadministration. He changed and created new types and denominations to mask the weakening \n\nand debasement of the alloy (impoverishing in metal) in relation to the inflated nominal \n\nvalues it represented [1].  \n\nAfter the death of D. Fernando I, Portuguese people reacted against his Castilian \n\nsuccession and required the protection of the \u201cMaster of the Order of Avis\u201d, who acceded to \n\nthe throne in 1385, founding the second Portuguese dynasty.  \n\n1.1.2 Chemical composition of coins  \n\nCompositional information constitutes a fundamental tool in the study of antique coins. \n\nStudying the elemental composition pattern of the alloy, its fineness and debasement, can \n\n\n\n \n\n4  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nprovide valuable information either to provenance studies or for investigations of \n\nmanufacturing processes, as well as identification of authenticity [4, 5, 9-11].  \n\nBillon was one of the most important and common alloys used for minted coins since \n\nthe ancient Greece. However, only a few studies were made on Portuguese antique coins \n\n(Guerra et al. [10, 12], Martins et al. [13-15] and Mata et al. [16, 17]) being the most \n\nnotorious conclusion that these coins were mostly constituted by copper (approximately \n\n90.0%), silver (around 8.0%) and some minor elements.  \n\n(i) Copper  \n\nCopper (Cu) occurs naturally as native Cu or alloyed with other elements. In both states \n\nit forms a large group of industrially important materials owing to its appealing visual \n\nappearance, excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, mechanical workability and \n\nresistance [18-20].  \n\nNative copper identification with silver and locally arsenic as major impurities is highly \n\ndesirable in artefacts because it is generally held that the working metals began with the use \n\nof pure copper [21]. According to Pernicka [21] the presence of volatile metals such as \n\nmercury (Hg) could provide chemical evidence for the presence of native copper; however \n\nthis element can also be absorbed on copper from groundwater during the burial, inducing \n\ninaccurate conclusions.  \n\nHistorically, the main working processes on this element were the cold working \n\nprocess\n2\n; annealing\n\n3\n, smelting\n\n4\n and re-melting\n\n5\n. It is important to retain that the ores were \n\ngenerally inhomogeneous showing zoning effects, and some elements could be lost during \n\nany of these processes. Even more, after the smelting process finding alloying copper with \n\nother metals was very common. Numerous copper alloys exist, many with important uses. \n\nApart from billon; brass is a copper-zinc alloy and bronze usually denotes copper-tin alloys \n\nyet can refer to any alloy of copper (e.g. aluminium bronze). The metal composition of bronze \n\nalloys and its deterioration processes has been examined numerous times [2, 5, 9, 17, 21-30].  \n\n(ii) Silver  \n\nSilver (Ag) and its alloys have been used in many objects of cultural heritage due to its \n\nluxuriousness, luster and intrinsic value. Even more, the surface enrichment of archaeological \n\ncopper alloys, either intentional or due to corrosion processes, has been known for many years \n\nand it is of main interest for a chronological assignment [31, 32].  \n\n                                                 \n\n2-5\n The definitions are presented on Annexe I. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n5  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nThe application of a layer of silver onto the surface of a low noble metal (silver surface \n\nenrichment) was possible by using chemical, mechanical, thermo-mechanical or physical \n\ntreatments [5, 33]. All of this processes varied greatly from time to time and place to place. \n\nParticularly the presence of areas in the coin with higher content of silver is a normal \n\nbehaviour in billon alloys due to the low solubility of silver in copper, and vice versa, at room \n\ntemperature. Based on Martins and Martins [15] the solubility of Cu in Ag is of 8.0% at \n\n780\u00b0 C, and practically zero at room temperature. During cooling, the system separates each \n\ncomponent in the pure state with the same reticular structure as the one in the supersaturated \n\nsolid solution; so the formation of rich areas of silver dispersed in copper matrix depends on \n\nthe rate of cooling and thickness of the sample.  \n\nSilver was not the only metal applied to the surface of the coins in order to give them a \n\nrich and shine appearance. Other intentional plating elements were carried out with antimony \n\nor arsenic, for example.  \n\n(iii) Minor elements  \n\nThere are a number of factors which can give rise to systematic variations in the \n\nconcentration levels of minor elements in antique copper alloys, including, for example, the \n\nmineralogy of the copper ore source; partition, volatilisation and contamination of trace \n\nelements (from various sources) during the smelt between metal and slag phases; the \n\ndeliberate addition of other metals (e.g. tin or lead) to the finished metal; co-smelting of \n\ndifferent ores to produce alloys directly; the poly-metallic ore sources that would naturally \n\ncreate alloys in the smelt; and changes in chemistry through melting, re-melting and working \n\nof the metal [25].  \n\nElements such as lead, tin, antimony or zinc, nickel and cobalt, gold or even silver can \n\nbe present on the surface of copper alloy coins [5, 10, 21, 23, 28, 34]. Lead (Pb) due to its \n\ncompact structure and large atoms forms a good alloy with other elements in particular with \n\ncopper [23]. Concerning the presence of this element on the coin surface, it is related to its \n\nvery low solubility in copper and its low melting temperature with respect to that of the \n\ncopper matrix, which causes the formation of fine particles dispersed throughout the copper \n\n[5]. Generally, less amount of lead is an effective evidence for a good refining process [21, \n\n34]. Ingo et al. [5] put forward the hypothesis that the presence of antimony (Sb) could have \n\nbeen enhanced by the craftsmen, firstly during the blank production thus inducing the \n\noccurrence of the inverse segregation phenomenon on the outermost region.  \n\n\n\n \n\n6  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nThe hypothesis that minor elements concentrations should be a guide to the provenance \n\nof antique metals has been around for more than a hundred years and explored for decades \n\n[10, 21]. The content of these elements can be governed by ore composition or related to the \n\nsmelting process. In fact changes on minor elements levels give important information about \n\nthe ore provenance [12]. \n\n1.1.2.1 Provenance  \n\nThe most difficult question in numismatics is the attribution of provenance [10]. Either \n\nthe mine is known and the goal is to correlate the objects to it, or the mine is unknown and the \n\ntarget it to determine which mine was exploited to make the objects. However, the place of \n\norigin/burial is of great importance to understand the mechanism of the phenomena \n\nresponsible for the deterioration.  \n\nBased on literature [15, 21, 25] it is possible to elaborate Table 1.2 which presents a list \n\nof elements that were deliberately alloyed with copper as well as those stemming from the ore \n\nextraction. Only a very limited range of trace elements are directly related to the provenance \n\nof the ore. Even more, in earlier times it cannot be assumed that deliberate alloying occur.  \n\nTable 1.2 \u2013 List of reported elements in antique and native copper and their potential uses in achaeometallurgy.  \n\nTechnology Provenance and/or technology Provenance \n\nB, Ba, Be, Cr, Cs, Ga, Ge, Hf, Li, \n\nMn, Mo, Na, Nb, Rb, S, Sc, REE\nc\n, \n\nSr, Ta, Ti, Th, U, V, W, Y, Zr \n\nAl\nb\n, As, Ca\n\nb\n, Cd\n\na\n, Cl\n\nb\n, Co, Fe\n\nb\n, \n\nIn, Hg\na,b\n\n, K\nb\n, Mg\n\nb\n, P\n\nb\n, Re, Si\n\nb\n, \n\nSb, Se, Te, Tl\na\n \n\nAu, Ag, Bi, Ir, Ni, \n\nOs, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru \nSn > ca. 1% \n\nZn and Pb> ca. 5% \n\nSn &lt;ca. 1% \n\nZn and Pb&lt;ca. 5% \n\na \nOnly applicable with native copper. \n\nb \nSoil contamination. \n\nc \nRare Earth Elements.  \n\n1.1.2.2 Manufacturing  \n\nCoin minting obeys to several laws of the monetary system (national and/or worldwide) \n\nand its values are linked to a monetary standard. Moreover, there is the intent to produce \n\nobjects that will last and can be easily distinguished from one another.  \n\nFerraro Vaz [1] presents a resume about the antique Portuguese coins manufacturing \n\nprocess. According to this author, when a coin is hammered or milled the metal is prepared in \n\ndisks and then submitted to the minting by manual pressure, marking them with the letters and \n\nfigures (usually different) in both faces (obverse and reverse).  \n\n\n\n \n\n7  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nStudies presented by Guerra [10] show that varying the ratio of some minor elements \n\nwith respect to the major ones (usually silver, copper or gold) may indicate a deliberate \n\naddition of a specific element to the alloy, meaning a change in the manufacture technology.  \n\n1.1.3 Coin deterioration  \n\nStudies on corroded metallic archaeological artefacts are of great importance since they \n\ncan improve knowledge in the field of the long-term corrosion phenomena providing help, to \n\nscientists and conservators, in order to control and stop the process of deterioration of historic \n\nmetals in museums and in selecting their ideal storage conditions; or even on its historical and \n\narchaeological classification [11, 17, 28]. However metals are generally difficult materials to \n\nanalyze once they might have been re-melted and reused in new minting or for producing \n\nother objects [10]. \n\nCoins are very sensitive samples to the effect of deterioration processes. Their state of \n\nconservation depend on normal wearing processes before and after burial, being the extent \n\nand depth of the corrosion phenomena closely dependent on the corrosive environment \n\n(chemical composition, pH, resistivity, etc) and other non-negligible parameters, such as the \n\ntype of electrolyte and the alloy microstructure, historical periods, metallurgical techniques or \n\neven the kind and size of the artefact [2, 15, 28, 29].  \n\nBased on these assumptions the interaction of archaeological artefacts with the \n\nneighbouring environment becomes very important in the field of preservation and corrosion. \n\nMost studies of different environmental conditions (soils [28, 35, 36], atmosphere [37- 43] \n\nand marine exposure [18, 28, 44, 45]) tried to establish the correlation between the artefacts \n\nchemical composition, its surroundings and their patinas structures.  \n\nApart from corrosion occurring in air and wet soil it has to be considered that such \n\nleaching phenomena can also be caused by chemical treatments of the objects. In organic or \n\ninorganic acidic solutions the less noble constituents of the alloy are dissolved, while the \n\nnobler components, e.g. silver or gold, are enriched at the surface [32].  \n\n1.1.3.1 Coin patina  \n\nPatina is a coating of all chemical compounds such as corrosion products (namely, \n\noxides, carbonates, sulphides and sulphates, nitrites and nitrates, phosphates, etc.) and other \n\nexogenous elements (silicon, calcium, etc.) formed and retained on the surface of the pure or \n\nalloyed metal, changing its surface texture and colour [6, 40, 46]. It can be produced and \n\nchanged by chemical processes, wear, polishing, age, or, principally, due exposure to \n\n\n\n \n\n8  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\natmospheric elements (air, rain, soil, etc.). As that it is important to consider the \n\nalloy/patina/environment as a global system in which the patina must be regarded as the result \n\nof the physicochemical interactions between the alloy and the environment, with time [29].  \n\nPatinas are built up during relatively short periods of time (6-50 years) with respect to \n\nthe total conservation environment duration (hundreds to thousands of years). Once formed, \n\npatina layer is relatively stable and it becomes a permanent part of the object acting as a \n\nprotective barrier, attenuating or eliminating the corrosive phenomena [13, 40, 41]. Copper \n\npatinas are generally regarded as aesthetically pleasing to the point of being purposely \n\ndeposited on the metal surface by artists and metalworkers.  \n\n1.1.3.2 Usually compounds and their formation reactions  \n\nCorrosion of archaeological artefacts is studied through the analyses of its patina \n\nproducts. The knowledge of its constituents is the first step to understand the corrosion \n\nmechanism. Since the morphology of the patinas, their adhesion and degree of porosity are \n\ndependent on the climatologically conditions, nature and level of pollutants, each metal \n\nbehaves in a different way and forms specific compounds that reflect the chemical properties \n\nof the metal and the environment to which it is exposed. \n\nInitially the interface metal/medium is formed by cuprite (Cu2O) (Reaction 1.1) [13, 15, \n\n27, 40, 41, 46]. This compound is also the dominating phase that constitutes about half of the \n\ntotal patina mass [40] and it growths proceeds for years, centuries, or millennia, and may \n\nreach thicknesses of the order of several tens of micrometers [13].  \n\n              Reaction 1.1 \n\nSince Cu2O suffers an increasing rate of nucleation with increasing the relative \n\nhumidity (RH), due the higher quantity of adsorbed water clusters that acts as nucleation sites, \n\nits reaction formation is RH dependent [43]. Reaction 1.2 shows the cuprite oxidation, \n\nnoticing that it does not take place any further in the later stage of the corrosion [39, 46]. \n\nMoreover, oxidation of cuprite under atmospheric conditions must be slower than that of \n\ncopper otherwise the intermediate cuprite would not exist. Reaction 1.4 represents the \n\nbalanced redox reaction for the anodic and cathodic reactions in oxygen presence (Reactions \n\n1.2 and 1.3, respectively):  \n\n       \n              \n\n   Reaction 1.2 \n\n          \n        Reaction 1.3 \n\n        \n        \n\n         Reaction 1.4 \n\n\n\n \n\n9  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nCuprite is formed on the surface and later converted into other chemical compounds in \n\nagreement with the environment. Hydroxides and hydrated compounds of Cu (II) could be \n\nformed after the long-term (<1000 years) due the interaction between the coins, its first patina \n\nlayer and the corrosion environment [27].  \n\nTable 1.3 presents a resume on the most commonly crystalline copper compounds \n\nfound and studied over different patinas on copper and copper alloys artefacts.  \n\nTable 1.3 \u2013 Most commonly crystalline copper compounds found in patina of Cu/Cu-alloys artefacts.  \n\nName Formula Colour Reference \n\nCuprite Cu2O \nRed-brownish. \n\nBecomes black over time. \n[13, 15, 27, 40, 41, 46] \n\nTenorite CuO Steel-grey, black [13] \n\nMalachite Cu2CO3(OH)2 Green [13, 15, 27] \n\nAtacamite Cu2Cl(OH)3 Green [15, 27, 41, 46] \n\nBrochantite Cu4SO4(OH)6 Green [15, 41, 46] \n\nAzurite Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2 Blue [27] \n\nNantokite CuCl Colourless, greyish to green [13] \n\nParatacamite Cu4Cl2(OH)6 Green [13, 41] \n\nAntlerite Cu3SO4(OH)4 Green [40] \n\nPosnjakite Cu4SO4(OH)6.H2O Blue [41, 46] \n\nLangite Cu4SO4(OH)6.2H2O Blue [40] \n\nGerhardtite Cu2NO3(OH)3 Green [40] \n\nChalcopyrite CuFeS2 Yellow [30] \n\nChalcocite Cu2S Black [15] \n\n \n\nPatina colours are directly connected to the nature of the corrosive environment and not \n\nto the composition of the alloy. However, they cannot be considered as a valid criterion for \n\nproviding a quick identification of typical corrosion products.  \n\nDepending on the environment, tenorite (CuO) (Reaction 1.5), malachite \n\n(Cu2CO3(OH)2) (Reaction 1.6), atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3) (Reaction 1.7) and brochantite \n\n(Cu4SO4(OH)6) (Reaction 1.8) are the principal patina constituents on copper-silver alloys, \n\nbeing the three last ones only compatible with oxidizing conditions; while compounds as \n\ncuprite (Cu2O), chalcocite (Cu2S) and nantokite (CuCl) (Reaction 1.9) are formed under \n\ntypical reducing conditions, unless the conditions varies imposed by organic and/or inorganic \n\nmatter in the medium.  \n\n             Reaction 1.5 \n\n                              Reaction 1.6 \n\n         \n                         \n\n   Reaction 1.7 \n\n         \n                          \n\n   Reaction 1.8 \n\n\n\n \n\n1 0  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n        \n                 Reaction 1.9 \n\nIn fact what usually happens is the inter-conversion of cuprite, generally by its \n\noxidation, into several different compounds according to the different environmental \n\nconditions. Beyond those exposed above, for example, azurite (Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2) (Reaction \n\n1.10) or paratacamite (Cu4Cl2(OH)6) (Reaction 1.11) formation reactions:  \n\n                \n \n\n                     \n Reaction 1.10 \n\n                                Reaction 1.11 \n\nDue Cu2O oxidation, pH of the aqueous layer increases, while the formation of copper \n\nsulphates (e.g. brochantite or posnjakite) and the presence of weak atmospherics acids (e.g. \n\nformic, acetic, oxalic and/or carboxylic acids) act as buffers making the pH reaming at its \n\nequilibrium for the sulphates formation, increasing the time of reaction [46]. Reaction 1.12 \n\nshows the reaction on brochantite stability domain. Even more, posnjakite is a hydrated form \n\nof brochantite and could be formed as a precursor of it. Studies made by Fitzgerald et al. [46] \n\nshow that pH increases until tenorite is formed on the surface of cuprite and stifled further \n\noxidation. Brochantite dissolution and the formation of tenorite under these conditions are \n\ngiven by Reaction 1.13.  \n\n         \n                      \n\n   Reaction 1.12 \n\n                    \n          \n\n   Reaction 1.13 \n\nThere exists a critical SO2 deposition rate above which brochantite does not form and \n\nexisting patinated surfaces will dissolve [46]. \n\nSome of these compounds can be used at screening for the coins \u201csurvival\u201d for so many \n\nyears. Even more, they can be associated with particular environments. Generally, malachite \n\npresence suggests that the object could be buried (in soil); brochantite has normally origin in \n\nthe atmosphere contact; atacamite and paratacamite suggest the presence of chlorides in the \n\nplace of burial (maybe near seawater) and chalcocite the presence of anaerobic reducing \n\nenvironments [15, 26].  \n\nFinally, is important to notice that noble metals (e.g. Ag) accelerate corrosion, while the \n\nmost catholically active ones (e.g. Pb, Sn) protect it during a certain period [13]. Silver does \n\nnot react readily with the oxygen at room temperature. However, as shown before, adsorbed \n\nwater layers into the oxide structure promotes irregularities that allow the penetration of \n\ncorrosive ions. In consequence silver may suffer corrosion due to local action cells according \n\nto the Reactions 1.14 to 1.16 [14, 15]:  \n\n\n\n \n\n1 1  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n                               Reaction 1.14 \n\n                        Reaction 1.15 \n\n              Reaction 1.16 \n\nMoreover, silver can also suffer attack by Cu (II) ions in the presence of chloride ions \n\n[15] as Reaction 1.17 shows:  \n\n                        Reaction 1.17 \n\nThe silver chloride, although insoluble in water, does not grow as a protective coating \n\non the surface, so this reaction is rendered decisively corrosive in the copper enriched areas \n\nbeing induced by oxygen and humidity [15].  \n\n1.1.3.3 Patina structural aspects  \n\nDivalent metal ions such as Cu\n2+\n\n commonly form compounds with layered structures. \n\nCopper patina, typically, consists of two distinct layers: a 5-15 \u00b5m inner layer of essentially \n\ncontinuous cuprite and an external, porous layer, about 5-40 \u00b5m of basic copper sulphates, \n\nchlorides and carbonates [14, 17, 39, 40, 46]. However, it can continue to grow during many \n\nyears or even decades of exposure and may reach a thickness of the order of several tens of \n\nmicrometers [10, 40]. These layers are held together by sulphate groups, hydrogen bonds and \n\nweak Cu-O bonds and, in spite of the structural resemblance between the compounds, the fact \n\nis that the phases have different cell symmetry [40]. For example, native silver and native \n\ncopper, cuprite, nantokite and chlorargyrite present a cubic crystal system; atacamite is \n\northorhombic; and malachite, tenorite, brochantite and azurite present a monoclinic cell \n\nsymmetry. This structural resemblance suggests that one phase can act as seed crystal for the \n\nformation of a subsequent phase.  \n\nFigure 1.1 shows a scheme for the general patina evolution on copper artefacts, \n\ndisplaying the formation of different compounds as a function of exposure time in different \n\nenvironments. One consequence of the gradual evolution of patina is that it gradually \n\nbecomes less soluble and, hence more resistant to atmospheric corrosion [40]. \n\n\n\n \n\n1 2  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Patina evolution scheme on copper artefacts along time and environment of exposure. \n\nRobiola et al. [28] established a new structure patina classification of copper based \n\nalloys (particularly, Cu-Sn alloys), when exposed to an oxygenated corrosive medium. In \n\nresume, they assert that the corrosion patterns can be differentiated into two categories, \n\naccording to patina colours, aspects and state of preservation of the original size of the object \n\n(i.e. the original surface limit) and based on its microstructures identification and \n\ncharacterization. Both categories can be observed on one and the same artefact. He et al. [27] \n\nlater added that this double-structured deposit consist of an inner layer of Cu (I) salts and an \n\nexternal layer of Cu (II) compounds, which are depended on the history and the elemental \n\ncomposition of the object. Basically, Type I or \u201ceven\u201d surface patinas build up under a mild \n\ncorrosion condition and in a relatively short period of time being very protective and strongly \n\ninfluenced by the presence of incorporated soil components. While Type II or \u201ccoarse\u201d \n\nsurface patinas are thicker patinas formed when the original surface has been destroyed or \n\ndeformed by severe corrosive attacks during the early stage of exposure.  \n\nAs the bronze corrosion process leads to a preferential dissolution of copper ions into \n\nthe environment, exogenous elements (textiles or leather, insects, woods or even pure organic \n\nmatters) can be entrapped in the corrosion layers or mineralised [29].  \n\n1.1.3.4 Patina and the corrosive environment  \n\nThe importance of exploring the influence of environmental conditions on atmospheric \n\ncorrosion rates of metals is justified by prediction of future corrosion rates as well as to \n\ncontrol its degradation.

Even more, humidity, precipitation and wind play an \n\nimportant role on the atmospheric pollutants transportation and deposition on the object.  \n\nElectrochemical corrosion of copper is dependent on the type of metal as well as the \n\npollutants present in the system. Once the metal dissolution occurs in presence of an \n\nelectrolyte provided by atmospheric precipitation or by adsorption of water molecules on the \n\nsurface of the corrosion layer, relative humidity plays a central role among the climatic \n\nfactors. Especially since the presence of corrosive species which attract water vapour become \n\nsoluble above a critical RH, lead to a sharp increase in the corrosion rate [39].  \n\nAmong the most abundant contaminants are sulphates, nitrates and nitrites, ozone, \n\nchlorides, carbonates, hydrogen ions, ammonium, metal ions, atmospheric particles and also \n\norganic compounds.  \n\nGenerally and based on literature [39, 42, 43] ozone (O3) has the strongest effect on the \n\ncorrosion of copper followed by nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide (NO2 and SO2, \n\nrespectively). Even more, O3 and NO2 led to a uniform corrosion attack while in the presence \n\nof SO2 a locally attack can be observed [39].  \n\nOzone is recognised to be a potential corrosion accelerator in corrosion research \n\noriginating metal loss and hindering the passivation layer formation. This occurs possibly due \n\nO3 strong oxidative power and because it can produce hydroxyl radical, which is balanced by \n\nthe metal dissolution [39]. Moreover, the exposure to ozone led to the formation of a \n\nconsiderable amount of water-soluble nitrites and to copper sulphite species oxidation, \n\nforming copper sulphates (CuSO4.xH2O) and increasing the Cu2O formation [39, 43].  \n\nWhen exposed to NO2 the major species formed on the copper surface are: Cu2O and \n\ngerhardtite; moreover, when copper sulphide species are present this pollutant is able to \n\noxidize them to CuSO4.xH2O [13, 38, 39, 42, 43]. In water rinses nitrate dominates over \n\nnitrite [43]. Formation of gerhardtite can be a result of nitric acid (HNO3) and dinitrogen \n\npentoxide reactions [38, 39]. Due to the high water solubility of HNO3 this pollutant dissolves \n\neasily in the adlayer and the chemical reaction on the metal surface is enhanced leading to a \n\ndecreased surface resistance.  \n\n\n\n \n\n1 4  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nSulphates can be supplied directly from rain water; via adsorption and oxidation of \n\nsulphur dioxide within the aqueous layer; or from aerosols [46]. However, deposition rates \n\ndepend greatly on the nature and geometry of the surface. Adsorption of SO2 on copper \n\nsurfaces is strongly influenced by RH [46]. The interaction between a water covered metal \n\nsurface and SO2 can be described by Reactions 1.18 to 1.21 sequence:  \n\n                Reaction 1.18 \n\n            \n      Reaction 1.19 \n\n          \n        \n\n       Reaction 1.20 \n\n      \n      \n\n   Reaction 1.21 \n\nAfter deposition and dissolution of SO2 into the water layer (Reaction 1.18), a \n\nbisulphite ion (HSO3\n-\n) is formed by hydrolysis of sulphur dioxide (Reaction 1.19) producing \n\na metal-sulphito surface complex (      \n ), through an exchange mechanism with the \n\nhydroxylated metal oxide surface (     ) (Reaction 1.20). Liquid metal-sulphito \n\ncomplexes (    \n ) subsequently detach from the metal-surface (M) and precipitate as solid \n\ncorrosion products (Reaction 1.21) [42].  \n\nThe principal compounds found in copper patinas when exposed to SO2 rich \n\nenvironments are cuprite, basic copper sulphates and sulphites [13, 39, 40, 43].  \n\nWhen sulphur- or chlorine-containing atmospheric species are more dominant, the \n\npatina formation reaction sequence becomes more complex and involves more copper patina \n\nconstituents [40].  \n\nConventional atmospheric parameters that affect copper generally affects silver too \n\ncomprising weathering factors (temperature, moisture, radiation, wind velocity, etc.), air \n\npollutants and aerosols. In presence of a strong oxidizer, silver rate corrosion increases [37].  \n\n(ii) Exposure to marine environments  \n\nMarine environments, such as coastal or near-coastal countries as Portugal, are chloride \n\n(Cl\n-\n) rich environments.  \n\nUrban atmosphere patinas are, in general, more adherent and uniform, than the ones \n\nexposed to chloride-rich environments. These last patinas are generally heterogeneous and \n\npresent flaking and scaling, which allows localized corrosion; however, in the marine \n\natmosphere patinas the degree of adhesion increases with time [18, 41, 44]. Zhang et al. [44] \n\nconcluded that flaking mechanism associated to these loosely adherent patina layers is \n\nconnected with the formation of nantokite.  \n\n\n\n \n\n1 5  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nIn chlorine-polluted environments a general stratification of corrosion products for a \n\nmature film is mainly composed of cuprite, as the initial phase in the evolution of the copper \n\npatina (inner layer), followed by the interfacial region in-between of CuCl which commonly \n\ntransforms into the more voluminous corrosion product of atacamite or the isomorphous \n\nphase paratacamite, which correspond to the outer layer [6, 18, 40, 41, 44, 45]. According to \n\nWallinder et al. [18] the composition of the outer part of the patina layer and its solubility \n\nproperties are major factors that influence the extent of released metals, originating an \n\nincrease of corrosion rates and the consequent metal loss. Even more, due paratacamite is \n\nmost voluminous than nantokite, it induces internal physical stresses that leads to a separation \n\nbetween the inner patina layer and the outer deposit which induces the flaking process on \n\ncopper [44]. This process is facilitated by the porous nature of the patina that allows \n\npenetration of moisture (water) and oxygen inducing an autocatalytic corrosion of copper [15, \n\n18, 44] according to Reactions 1.22 and 1.23. Moreover, He et al. [27] claim that on the \n\narchaeological copper alloys the chloride anion was one of the major causes for bronze \n\ncorrosion in soil.  \n\n                                Reaction 1.22 \n\n                   Reaction 1.23 \n\nThe method of cuprite production in the presence of the Cl\n-\n ion is a precipitation \n\nreaction. The equilibrium in Reaction 1.24 is shifted to the right as the local concentration of, \n\ne.g.      \n  (Reaction 1.25) complex increases and Cu2O is deposited in response [45]:  \n\n              \n           \n\n            \n    Reaction 1.24 \n\n      \n               \n\n       Reaction 1.25 \n\nThe stability of Cu2O is inversely dependent on the concentration of chloride ions. Thus \n\nthe rate of re-dissolution of the protective cuprite is much higher than that observed in \n\nneutral/alkaline solution. An increasing pH resulting from the oxygen reduction reaction will \n\nfavour the consumption of CuCl complex to form cuprous oxide [45]. According to Kear et \n\nal. [45] the buffering properties of seawater (due to the presence of carbonate/bicarbonate and \n\nborate ions) will act to limit any change in pH of the electrolyte adjacent to the active surface.  \n\n(iii) Soil exposure  \n\nMetal corrosion in soil media varies according the supply of an oxidizing agent (usually \n\noxygen from the air) and the presence of an electrolyte (a water solution).  \n\n\n\n \n\n1 6  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nThe extension of the corrosive phenomena is dependent of several soil parameters, \n\nnamely soil texture and grain size, soil acidity (pH, buffer capacity) and the amount of soluble \n\nsalts, as well as their richness in chloride or phosphate and presence of soot, which affects the \n\ncapillary of the soil giving more, or less, access to water and air [35, 36, 28]. Moderately \n\naerated and moist soil above the ground water table (e.g. sand) generally promotes corrosion \n\nof metals giving access for O2 at the same time as the pores are partly filled with H2O. On the \n\nother hand a fine-grained soil or a coarse-grained soil (e.g. clay and gravel or pebble, \n\nrespectively) should be less harmful. In fact, the aggressiveness of different soil types toward \n\nburied metal structures is a more important factor than the total age in years [35, 36]. \n\nIt must be noticed that the chemical composition and properties of archaeological soils \n\nchange over time as well as climate and activity on the site. In fact deterioration of buried \n\nmetallic objects sensibly accelerated during the last 50-100 years, as a result of the \n\ntechnological progress and new agricultural practices [2, 28, 36].  \n\nEspecially well preserved metal objects are usually found in calcareous regions, or in \n\npeat or bogs due to the absence of oxygen. Copper phosphates are not generally found as \n\ncorrosion products except in characteristic environments in association with decomposing \n\nburied bones and in arid climate [30]. In the presence of sulphur or sulphate-rich soils, \n\ngenerally produced by the decomposition of organic matter in an almost oxygen-free \n\nenvironments, posnjakite, brochantite and antlerite are the most common find compounds [13, \n\n30]. Finally, compounds formed from elements in the soil (Si and Al) and Pb may have \n\nresulted from corrosion of metallic objects associated with the use of weapons [16].  \n\n1.1.3.5 Corrosion inhibitors  \n\nTo improve the protective efficiency of copper corrosion great efforts have been put \n\ninto investigation and lots of technologies have been used [20; 47, 48, 49]. One of the most \n\nstudied and avant-garde method for preventing the atmospheric corrosion of copper is the use \n\nof an appropriate inhibitor. Generally film assembling inhibitors based on green chemicals are \n\npreferred for this purpose [47]. However volatile corrosion inhibitors are the most effective \n\nand affordable for industrial use [48].  \n\nThe use organic molecules containing O, N, S and polar functional groups as corrosion \n\ninhibitors for copper and copper alloys have been widely investigated, in order to understand \n\ntheir strong adsorption on the metal surface by plugging the active sites and forming \n\nprotective films on it, being its efficiency dependent on the film characteristics, namely the \n\nnature and the surface charge of the metal, the adsorption mode, its chemical structure and the \n\n\n\n \n\n1 7  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\ntype of the electrolyte solution formed [19, 20, 47-49]. Specially, amines and azole \n\nderivatives have been reported to be very effective inhibitors in acidic and neutral corrosion \n\nmedia [49] due their polar hydrophobic end groups which stabilizes the adsorption process \n\n[19, 47, 49].  \n\nIn the other hand, the main advantage of volatile corrosion inhibitors compared with \n\nconventional corrosion control methods, are their gas-phase transport that enables metallic \n\nsurfaces to be reached. Even more, this films are very thin and do not interfere with \n\nsubsequent use or treatment of the surface [48].  \n\nIn resume and based on literature, some examples on new corrosion inhibitors, are \n\ndescribed in Table 1.4.  \n\nTable 1.4 \u2013 Examples of some recent copper corrosion inhibitors.  \n\nCompound Chemical structure Reference \n\n3-((2-mercaptophenyl)imino)butanoate \n\n(MMPB) \n \n\n[47] \n\nBenzotriazole \n(BTAH)  \n\n[48] \n\n2,5-Dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole \n(DMTD)  \n\n[20] \n\n5-(3-aminophenyl)-tetrazole \n(APT) \n\n \n\n[49] \n\n \n\nTansug et al. [47] examined MMPB inhibition ability in acidic chloride media \n\nconcluding that the high efficiency of it was related with its ability to complex with Cu (I) at \n\nthe surface. Once the adsorbed molecules interact with each other along the carboxylate tails a \n\nfilm-like adsorption layer is formed on the surface [47]. BTAH and its derivatives can be used \n\nspecifically for atmospheric Cu corrosion protection according to Chen et al. [48]. This \n\ncompound acts as a mixed corrosion inhibitor interacting, via N atom, with the Cu (0) to form \n\na thin protective film in non-corroded areas and with Cu (I) to outline a thick polymeric \n\ncomplex on the Cu2O substrate on the defect sites [48]. Qin et al. [20] studied the DMTD and \n\nSherif et al. [49] used APT. In both cases a protective monolayer film against copper \n\ncorrosion in acidic solution is formed. They are good inhibitors due their strong adsorption on \n\nthe copper surface, increasing surface and polarization resistances.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n1 8  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n1.2 PAPER  \n\nThe word \"paper\" is etymologically derived from papyrus, the word for the Cyperus \n\npapyrus plant and which was used to produce a thick, paper-like material by the ancient \n\nEgyptians, Greeks and Romans [50]. However papyrus and paper are different materials. The \n\nfirst one is a \"lamination\u201d of the natural plant, while paper is manufactured from fibres whose \n\nproperties have been changed by maceration or disintegration.  \n\nDue to its historical, scientific and social importance is easily understood the \n\nimportance of paper conservation once it is one of the most fragile guardians of people \n\ncultural heritage.  \n\n1.2.1 Paper history and social impact  \n\nPapermaking has traditionally been traced to China, about 105 a.C., when T\u00b4sai Lun, an \n\nofficial attached to the Imperial court, created a sheet of paper using rags (textile waste) as the \n\nraw material. The earliest piece of paper found was discovered at Fangmatan (Gansu, China) \n\ninscribed with a map.  \n\nPaper spread from China, through the Middle East to medieval Europe in the \n\n13\nrd\n\n century and since that time, paper was the main material for recording cultural \n\nachievements all over the world [51]. Although the notion of paper being used as a practical \n\neveryday item, did not occur until the 15\nth\n\n century, the advantages of mill-based papermaking \n\nspread throughout Europe in the 15\nth\n\n and 16\nth\n\n centuries [50, 52].  \n\nOn the 18\nth\n\n and 19\nth\n\n centuries Industrial Revolutions gave rise to new papermaking \n\nmachinery that severely macerated the pulp and fast heat-dried the paper. Even more, the use \n\nof sulphuric acid and chloride as bleaches and the replacement of gelatine by alum-rosin for \n\ninternal sizing\n6\n made from this epoch one of the most important ones in paper history [53]. \n\nAfter the invention of printing, paper demand consistently increased and the methods of \n\npapermaking radically changed. In the middle of the 19\nth\n\n century papermaking from rags was \n\nreplaced by the use of wood pulp [54].  \n\nPaper as a carrier for written information was introduced in Europe on the 20\nth\n\n century \n\n[55]. In the past 50 years the rate of innovation in papermaking has increased rapidly and \n\nnowadays paper can be impregnated, enamelled, creped, waterproofed, waxed, glazed, \n\nsensitized, bent, folded, twisted, crumpled, cut, torn, dissolved, moulded and embossed [50].  \n\n                                                 \n\n6\n The definition is presented on Annexe I. \n\n\n\n \n\n1 9  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n1.2.2 Chemical composition of paper \n\nPaper has several components which can be classified according to their origin; \n\nchemical structure and function, note that wood-derived fibres are mainly composed of \n\ncellulose but also of lignin, hemicelluloses and other minor components; mineral particles \n\nacting as fillers (e.g. talc, kaolin, calcium carbonate, etc.); natural sizing agents (starch or \n\nrosin) or synthetic ones (alkyl ketene dimer or alkenyl succinic anhydride) which are \n\ngenerally acidic; colorants; functional groups forming during papermaking (e.g. aldehydes, \n\nketones, carboxylic groups); metal ion impurities (mainly iron and copper); and other \n\nsubstances which can improve the characteristics of the paper for printing or writing and may \n\nalso contribute to its degradation phenomena [51, 55, 56]. \n\nAntique paper was made entirely from rags, i.e. from linear long cellulose fibres only \n\nwith the addition of sizing compounds; whilst contemporary paper can be manufactured from \n\nshort fibres and may contain non-fibrous components in order to improve its properties. \n\nHowever the change of fibre source from cotton and linen rags to wood fibres and the use of \n\nalum rosin sizes had significant adverse effects on the permanence and durability of paper \n\nmaterials. Nevertheless, the ageing behaviour of a paper is determined by its manufacture, not \n\nthe original source of the fibres [52]. As that, both paper composition and environmental \n\nconditions are decisive factors for the stability and durability of paper.  \n\n1.2.2.1 Cellulose \n\nCellulose is a long chain carbohydrate, natural polymer that gives wood its strength. It \n\nis the main component of plant cell walls and the basic building block for many textiles and \n\nfor paper (almost 90% of paper constitution) [57]. Chemically, pure cellulose is a very stable \n\nmaterial at ambient temperature [58]. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Cellulose structure: (a) two unlinked molecules of \u00df-D-glucose and (b) cellobiose.  \n\nThe links in the cellulose chain are a type of sugar. These sugar units are bonded when \n\nwater is eliminated by combining the -OH group with the H atom (Figure 1.2 (a)). Linking \n\njust two of these sugars produce a disaccharide called cellobiose (Figure 1.2 (b)); here \n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n \n\n2 0  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nglucose units are linked through a \u00df-(1,4)-glycosidic bond originating long chains that form \n\ncrystallites. Hereupon cellulose is a polysaccharide produced by linking additional sugars in \n\nthe exactly same way to form regular, hard and stable regions that give the bundled chains \n\nmore stability and strength [55, 57]. The length of the chain varies greatly from a few hundred \n\nsugar units, in wood pulp, to over 6000 for cotton, the purest natural form of cellulose [57]. \n\n1.2.2.2 Lignin  \n\nLignin is an amorphous, aromatic, water insoluble, heterogeneous, three dimensional \n\n(3D) and cross-linked polymer (Figure 1.3). This material is not composed of exactly \n\nrepeating units and can be described better as a macromolecule than as a polymer.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Structural model of softwood lignin [59].  \n\nLignin gives woody plants their physical strength however it reduces the strength of \n\npaper by interfering with the way that cellulose fibres assemble. Its function is to provide a \n\nmechanically strong composite material with cellulose [60]. Moreover this macromolecule is \n\nthe main cause of photo-yellowing of paper. In its structure are present several chromophores \n\nwith conjugated aromatic rings and carbonyl groups that absorb in the near UV spectrum \n\n(300\u2013400 nm). When these chromophores absorb light they can decompose into yellow \n\ncoloured ketones and quinones, turning the paper yellow. Since these molecules themselves \n\nabsorb visible light, they act as secondary chromophores and can react further, exacerbating \n\nthe yellowing and degradation processes, this is why paper yellows with age [55, 60].  \n\n\n\n \n\n2 1  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n1.2.3 Paper deterioration  \n\nPaper deterioration is a very slow and multi-parameter process. It is caused by \n\nendogenous (pH, metal ions, lignin, degradation products) and exogenous (RH, oxygen, light \n\nexposure, heat or pollutant gases) contributions. Paper chemical and mechanical properties, \n\nstability, degradation, etc. are strongly dependent upon the nature, origin and characteristics \n\nof cellulosic material as well as pulping and papermaking procedures, additives and its \n\ninteractions, and storage conditions [55, 56].  \n\nChemical, physical and biological processes may cause irreversible structural changes \n\nin the constituting fibres, resulting in discoloration and embrittlement. In fact, paper \n\ndeterioration means the weakening of inter-fibre bonds which results in an intrinsic decreased \n\nof strength due to cellulose deterioration. The modes of cellulose degradation within paper \n\ninclude chemical, which could be acid (producing formic, acetic, lactic and oxalic acids) or \n\nenzymatic hydrolysis, alkaline and oxidative degradation (which is mainly followed by a \n\nradical mechanism and has an important role in the natural ageing of paper); thermal \n\n(different levels of temperature) and radiation (exposure to UV/Visible and/or high-energy \n\nradiation); and by the presence of microorganisms or even with ink or printing media that are \n\nused historically in writing and illustrating [53-55, 60]. In these modes of cellulose \n\ndegradation, crystallinity or fibrillar morphology plays a decisive role in determining the rate \n\nand also the course of the degradation process. A high supramolecular order of the polymer \n\nchain generally prevents degradation [52, 55].  \n\n1.2.3.1 Manufacturing and storage \n\nDuring manufacturing and since the latter half of the 17\nth\n\n century, hydrated aluminium \n\nsulphate was added as a sizing agent. At this time it was not yet known that this compound \n\ndissociates in water to form sulphate and hexaaquaaluminium(III) ions (          \n  ) that \n\ncan undergo acid hydrolysis (Reaction 1.26):  \n\n          \n                       \n\n       \n   Reaction 1.26 \n\nDuring storage air pollutants play an important role on paper deterioration. Nitrogen \n\ndioxide can both form nitric acid on reacting with the moisture in paper (Reaction 1.27) \n\nand/or oxidise the hydroxyl groups on cellulose fibres to carboxylic acids, increasing the \n\nacidity of the paper (Reaction 1.28): \n\n                         Reaction 1.27 \n\n                                                     Reaction 1.28 \n\n\n\n \n\n2 2  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nSulphur dioxide can form sulphuric acid on reacting with the moisture in the paper. In \n\noxygen presence, the oxidation of SO2 followed by its hydration leads to acid production \n\n(redox Reaction 1.31 result from 1.29+1.30 reactions). This reaction can be catalyzed by the \n\npresence of certain metals (e.g. manganese) introduced in the paper making process.  \n\n                Reaction 1.29 \n\n                  Reaction 1.30 \n\n                    Reaction 1.31 \n\n1.2.3.2 Acid catalyzed degradation of cellulose  \n\nAcidic-catalyzed degradation of paper is the most common degradation reaction. It is \n\ninitiated by the acidic species (especially alum) introduced into the cellulose fibres during \n\npapermaking, causing its hydrolysis and reducing its degree of polymerization, eventually \n\ndegrading the fibres until the paper is disintegrated [55]. In addition, acid from polluted \n\natmospheres can enter the low-density, open regions of the fibre and cut the polymer chain.  \n\nIn general lignin, hemicellulose and hydrolyzed cellulose oxidize and produce \n\nsubstantial amounts of acidic products that breakdown the fibres. These acids further catalyze \n\npaper degradation and therefore this process is termed as \u201cautocatalytic\u201d. Reaction 1.32 [60] \n\nshows the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of ?-(1-4)-glycosidic bonds in cellulose. This reaction \n\nshortens the cellulose fibres lengths which lead to a loss of paper strength [54].  \n\n \n\n \n\nReaction 1.32  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe extend of depolymerization following the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis depends on the \n\nacid strength and concentration as well as on temperature and duration of the reaction [56]. \n\n1.2.3.3 Alkaline degradation of cellulose  \n\nWhen subjected to strong bases (such as Ca(OH)2 or alcoholate) cellulose chain ends \n\ncan react and undergo a depolymerization reaction. Its alkaline degradation mechanism \n\ninvolves various steps, e.g. ?-alcoxy elimination (\u201cpeeling reaction\u201d \u2013 Reaction 1.33 [58]) \n\nwhich explains the detrimental effect on paper permanence of excessively strong bases (B). \n\nWhen B species are exposed to air, they are rapidly transformed into the corresponding \n\ncarbonate [55]. \n\n\n\n \n\n2 3  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReaction 1.33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThese reactions must be considered when treating cellulose-based works of art with \n\nalkaline solutions for restoration purposes (e.g. deacidification processes) [56]. \n\n1.2.3.4 Oxidation of cellulose  \n\nThe oxidative degradation of cellulose is primarily induced by the presence of oxygen \n\nwhich acts as a non-specific oxidizing agent via various complex mechanisms.  \n\nOxidation of cellulose introduces side groups (namely aldehydes and ketones) that make \n\nthe molecule more easily hydrolyzed. Indeed these oxidized cellulose groups are known as \n\n\u201cpotential\u201d sites of degradation because oxidized cellulose chains are not \u201cactually\u201d broken \n\nbut they can easily degraded in both acidic and alkaline medium, even at mild concentrations \n\nand room temperature [55, 56]. Even more free radicals, generated by oxidation or by light, \n\ncan also cut the cellulose chain. Both cellulose (and its derivatives) and lignin within the \n\npaper can be oxidised leading to discolouration.  \n\nReaction 1.34 shows the cellulose chain scission resulting from oxidation where (a) is \n\nthe oxidation of the C3 hydroxyl to carbonyl originating a chain scission and (b) is the same \n\nprocess on the C2 hydroxyl resulting the keto-enol tautaumerization [58]. This process also \n\ncontributes to raising the concentration of acid on paper. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                          Reaction 1.34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n2 4  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n1.2.3.5 Biological degradation of cellulose  \n\nVarious biological contaminants are possible even in libraries and archives, and their \n\neffect can vary as a function of environmental situations and composition of the substrate. \n\nInsects and moulds are the most common cause of biological problems. However stopping \n\nthis type of detrimental evolution is not easy because its origin is frequently due to improper \n\nstoring conditions [55]. For example, moulds proliferate and reproduce themselves in organic \n\nsubstrates like cellulose which will provide feed for development. These fungi produce \n\nenzymes that will chemically attack fibres and cleave cellulose macromolecules. Moreover, \n\ntheir metabolism will produce acidic wastes, which contribute to paper degradation [55].  \n\nGamma radiation eliminates insects and fungi in the paper, it has no residual toxicity or \n\npollution and large volumes of material can be handled in short time [55]. \n\n1.2.3.6 Iron-gall ink corrosion  \n\nInk-induced corrosion of cellulose is a primary threat for paper documents of all kinds. \n\nPrevention of further iron-gall ink corrosion is a crucial issue in conservation science [61].  \n\nIron-gall inks were popular for several centuries until the mid-19\nth\n\n century. \n\nMetallo-gallate inks are typically composed by iron sulphate salt, ferrous sulphate and other \n\nsulphates in trace amounts; and a vegetable tanning agent, commonly gallotannin extracts \n\nfrom gall apples [61]. This constituent\u2019s act as powerful oxidation agents because large \n\namounts of metals are present and these may lead to extensive localized degradation [55]. \n\nDepending on source and preparation, the iron sulphate also contains impurities, such as \n\ncopper, zinc, aluminium and magnesium salts, establishing a complex system of different \n\n(de)stabilizing metal ions.  \n\nTheir main reaction is accomplished in two different steps, as Reaction 1.35 shows. \n\nFirst, gallic acid, formed by hydrolysis of the tannins extracts, reacts with ferrous cations \n\nfrom iron sulphate (FeSO4), in water, to form ferrous (II) gallate and sulphuric acid (a). After, \n\nin oxygen presence two molecules of this Fe (II) compound react, giving a \n\nferric (III) pyrogallate and water (b).  \n\n \n\n \n\nReaction 1.35 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n2 5  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nThe presence of Fe (II) ions excess can catalyze the oxidation of cellulose through the \n\nproduction of hydrogen peroxide, according to the Fenton mechanism\n7\n, which induces severe \n\ndegradation of paper by the loss of its mechanical properties (elasticity and tensile strength) as \n\nwell as along the lines of the ink and the perforation of the inked areas [61, 62].  \n\n1.2.4 Paper conservation \n\nPaper conservation is one of the most studied areas in the art and heritage conservation \n\nfield. Particular and recently the nanosized particles subject.  \n\nAlkaline nanosized particles, applied from non-aqueous dispersions have found to be \n\nparticularly efficient for the preservation of cellulose-based materials which degradation is \n\ncatalyzed by acidification processes developing in the paper and leading to chemical \n\ndisruption of the cellulose polymer [63] as exposed before.  \n\nIt is well known today that the standard composition of paper should have an alkaline \n\nreserve (that is, the enough amount of buffer compounds capable of neutralizing acids) and \n\nhave more than 1% lignin content, in way to prevent the paper deterioration. Deacidifying \n\nagents can provide this alkaline reserve, neutralizing the acidic groups present and avowing \n\ntheir acid hydrolysis. The use of non-acidic additives to make paper is becoming more \n\nprevalent and the stability of these papers is less of an issue. However an universal treatment \n\nof paper, able to deacidify, strengthen and protect against biological attack is still a challenge.  \n\n1.2.4.1 Deacidification agents \n\nDeacidification is the neutralization of existing acids in the paper and a chelating step to \n\ninactivate the transition metal ions that are needed for a successful treatment [64]. This \n\ntreatment is unavoidable in the preservation of paper because it provides a complete \n\nneutralization of paper and, in most cases, introduces an alkaline reservoir that opposes the \n\nincoming assault from the acidity present in the environment [65]. Correct deacidification \n\nprocess should produce the complete neutralization of the acidic paper and \n\nthermodynamically stable side products keeping the pH around 8-9 [54]. \n\nAlthough deacidification agents include strong bases such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) \n\nthe materials most often used for deacidification are weak bases, including carbonates, \n\nbicarbonates and some hydroxides, various oxides and amines [58]. Due the high compatible \n\nof these materials with the treated substrates it limits the drawbacks and ensures a long-lasting \n\nbeneficial effect on the paper surface.  \n\n                                                 \n\n7\n The definition is presented on Annexe I.  \n\n\n\n \n\n2 6  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n1.2.4.2 Calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide nanoparticles  \n\nFunctionalization processes through nanoparticles surfaces can passivate, protect and/or \n\nfunctionalize them, for a specific goal. Based on literature [54, 63, 64] nanoparticles can be \n\napplied by spraying, brushing or immersion and their use does not require any special safety \n\nprocedures. Their reactions and applications are usually simple to assemble and, in this \n\nparticle case, relatively inexpensive.  \n\nThese materials have found fundamental applications for the compatible preservation of \n\nboth immovable (e.g. consolidation of wall-paintings) and movable (e.g. deacidification of \n\npaper and wood artefacts) works of art [56]. They penetrate within the cellulose fibres on \n\npaper and neutralize the inherent acidity, causing a strong reduction in paper aging. One of the \n\nmost important features about these nanoparticles is their capability of nucleation and growth \n\ndue its significance for the formation of inorganic crystals control [56].  \n\n(i) Carbonates  \n\nCalcium carbonate (CaCO3) occurs as three anhydrous crystalline polymorphs (calcite, \n\naragonite and vaterite), in two crystal forms (hexahydrate ikaite and monohydrate) and also as \n\namorphous material. While calcite, with a rhombohedral symmetry, is the most \n\nthermodynamically stable polymorph of this compound, under ambient conditions, the other \n\ntwo anhydrous crystalline forms are metastable in nature (orthorhombic aragonite and the \n\nhexagonal vaterite crystal systems). Aragonite changes to calcite at 380\u2013470\u00b0C and vaterite is \n\neven less stable [66, 67].  \n\nThe applications of CaCO3 particles are determined by a number of strictly defined \n\nparameters (e.g., morphology, structure, size, brightness, oil adsorption and chemical purity) \n\n[63, 68]. These nanoparticles can enhance properties of the coating such as weather \n\nresistance, anti-corrosion, rheological properties and low abrasiveness [69, 70].  \n\nAlkaline earth carbonates, namely calcium and magnesium carbonate, must be \n\nconsidered as leading candidates for deacidification of paper because of their chemical \n\nsimplicity, relatively low cost, high brightness and suitability for use as paper fillers. However \n\nsimple carbonates tend to be relatively insoluble in neutral water as well as in organic \n\nsolvents, a factor that limits their manner of distribution on paper-based documents. \n\nRelatively pure calcium carbonate products, as all limestone and chalk, tend to buffer the pH \n\nin a more moderate range (7.5 to 8.5) in comparison with some precipitated CaCO3 products \n\nthat may contain some residual calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) (pH>9) [58].  \n\n\n\n \n\n2 7  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nOne of the most problematic issues for the use of CaCO3 is it hydrophilicity. Surface \n\nmodification of this compound with hydrophobic species would lead to a great expansion in \n\nits applications [68, 71]. A way to solve this problem is to tailoring the surface properties of \n\nnanoparticles by using organic capping layers or chemically installing functionality on \n\nnanoparticles surfaces through organic synthesis [72].  \n\n(ii)  Hydroxides  \n\nSuspensions or dispersions of alkaline earth hydroxides are typically used to achieve an \n\nalmost instantaneous neutralization of free H\n+\n ions with water formation [56].  \n\nBaty et al. [58] report that micro- and nano-particulate dispersions of calcium and \n\nmagnesium hydroxides show evidence of cellulose breakdown when unaged paper is treated; \n\nthese adverse effects were attributed to excessively high pH.  \n\nCalcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) proved to be an excellent deacidifying agent. It excess is \n\nslowly converted into carbonate because once the particles are deposited in paper, ensuring a \n\ngood physicochemical compatibility with the support, they have the theoretical ability of \n\nreacting with carbon dioxide from the air, forming calcium carbonate (alkaline buffer) in situ \n\nand without originate any undesirable side products [54, 56].  \n\n(iii) Calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide nanoparticles functionalization  \n\nSurface functionalization is the process of modification the nanoparticles\u00b4 surfaces \n\nthrough the introduction of specific chemical functionalities. This process can, for example, \n\nefficiently promote the dispersion of particles in a solvent. Organic additives can be \n\nintroduced to the crystallization process to modify the crystal surfaces and to control the \n\nparticle nucleation and growth, too.  \n\nParticularly, dodecanoic, or lauric, acid (DA) is a saturated fatty acid which is generally \n\npresent in the form of a white powder and like many other fatty acids, is inexpensive and \n\nnon-toxic, long shelf-life compound [73, 74].  \n\nDA is used in the present work as a surface modifier. It changes the CaCO3 \n\nnanoparticles from hydrophilic to hydrophobic and it is also used to control the particle size \n\nand shape. The Ca\n2+\n\n ions react with the DA to form a hydrophobic salt Ca(C12H23O2)2. After a \n\nCO2 flow, the hydrophobic properties of the final calcium carbonate nanoparticles are \n\nattributed to the deposition of these salt molecules onto the CaCO3 surface [68, 71]. \n\nAccording to Sarkar [66, 75] dodecanoic acid used as an additive during the preparation of \n\ncalcium carbonate, favours the formation of aragonite over calcite. Thus, the acid initiates the \n\nphase transformation from thermodynamically stable calcite to metastable aragonite phase. \n\n\n\n \n\n2 8  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nCalcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide nanoparticles synthesis  \n\nDespite of synthesis of nanoparticles is a simple process to carry out its thermodynamic \n\ntendency to agglomerate into bulk structures can be a problem. It is usually difficult to \n\nachieve the necessary high supersaturation degree for nucleation and the effect of co-ions at \n\nthese concentrations can be critical. The effects of control parameters, such as reaction \n\ntemperature, concentration of reacting species, and aging time of the nanostructure \n\ncharacteristics have been reported. Also, some studies report significant effects of organic \n\nsolvents on the shape and size of the particles obtained by precipitation [63, 65]. \n\nThere are two main different methods to synthesize nanomaterials, differentiated only \n\nby the starting material: top-down method - a material whose features are not in the \n\nnano-scale is worked to produce a nanostructure material; and bottom-up procedure - the \n\nnanostructures are built atom by atom from scratch. Different methods are very often \n\ncombined to produce materials with the desired properties [56].  \n\nIn the present study the paper by Chen et al. [68] is followed in order to test the new \n\nroute proposed by the authors. Here, a top-down method is used. It starts from a bulk material \n\nthat is broken into small pieces using mechanical, chemical and/or other forms of energy \n\n(temperature). The drawback is the poor control of the nanoparticles dimensions, since the \n\nsmallest size that can be produced by grinding is limited by the tendency to re-aggregate and \n\nparticles below a few microns cannot usually be produced [63]. The contaminations of the \n\nparticle surface by atmospheric gases and by materials used for the mill are others \n\ndisadvantages [63]. In this case calcium oxide (CaO), mixed with water, is used to synthesize \n\nCa(OH)2 (this reactions usually leads to a rather small amount of unreacted CaO) and then \n\nfunctionalized with dodecanoic acid (combination of steps (1) and (2) presented in the \n\nreactions below). After that and trough calcination with CO2 the remaining hydroxide is \n\nprecipitated in CaCO3 (combination of (3) and (4) steps). By tuning the critical reaction \n\nparameters Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes can be produced. \n\nDuring this process the conversion of oxide particles to hydroxide is accompanied by a \n\nchange in volume, which leads to a fragmentation of the particles and a reduction of their size. \n\nFinally, these particles can be effectively dispersed in a non-polar organic solvent (here, \n\ncyclohexane or nonane) trough ultrasound bath. In this particular the synthesis reaction is \n\ncomposed by four steps:  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n2 9  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n(1) Calcium oxide reaction with water producing Ca(OH)2 (Reaction 1.36).

Nucleation of calcite is \n\ninduced by carboxylate functional groups. According to Chen et al. [68] this carbonation \n\nroute can provide new insight into the industrialized production of CaCO3 with complex \n\nmorphology.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n3 1  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n2 TECHNIQUES  \n\nMost of the archaeological objects, regardless their form or materials, are unique and \n\nmost of the times cannot suffer sampling. Therefore the analytical methods/techniques applied \n\nto such samples should be non- or micro-destructive, preserving the integrity of the object. \n\nThis is especially important when valuable antique artefacts are investigated or trace element \n\nanalysis is required.  \n\n2.1 Coins visual analysis: a macro scale morphologic approach  \n\nThe general appearance of the corroded surface is of great importance not in order to \n\nestablish a direct identification of the patina products, since this assumption may induce some \n\nevaluation mistakes but in order to observe typical corrosion areas such as \u201ccauliflower\u201d \n\ncorrosion crust. In fact, this specific type of corrosion is considered to be a particular form of \n\n\u201cblack spot\u201d and can be distinguish by its structure (cauliflower-looking like) that can grow in \n\nspots or cover wider areas, and colour, mostly brown/black [76, 77].  \n\n2.2 Nanoparticles dispersions analysis  \n\nTo work with nanoparticles dispersions one of the most important points is the solvent \n\nchoice. It should be selected based on the features of the porous materials under evaluation. \n\nEven more, the dispersing solvent can be use as pure or in a mixture in order to achieve the \n\nideal penetration inside the artefact and the ideal rheological properties for the application \n\npurposes [63]. The best methods for paper deacidification are based on the use of \n\nnon-aqueous solvents, once less polar fluids minimize the risk of ink solubilisation [65]. \n\nMoreover, since nanoparticles are stable in alcohols without the need for stabilizers that could \n\nleave residues on the treated artefacts, alcoholic hydroxide dispersions can be used for the \n\nneutralization of paper acidity, generating an alkaline reserve of carbonate that prevents \n\nfurther degradation, minimizing the risk of swelling and solubilisation of metal-gall inks, \n\nwhich may be lost by using aqueous treatment. Once delivered on the paper the nanoparticles \n\nare immediately available for the deacidification or buffering.  \n\nIn this case, the dispersions were made with non-polar organic solvents namely, \n\ncyclohexane or nonane, noticing that, the dispersions were not mixed and were directly \n\nsonicated. This ultrasonic treatment promotes the physical absorption of the organic reactant \n\non the nanoparticles\u00b4 surface and yields to nanosized units that aggregate further into \n\nmass-fractal superstructures. The dispersions analysis is very important to understand how the \n\n\n\n \n\n3 2  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nmodified hydrophobic particles behave in this type of solvents. The ideal dispersions should \n\nbe stable in a time interval from 18 h to 24 h.  \n\n2.3 Turbidimetry  \n\nTurbidimetry is the process of measuring the turbidity (or cloudiness) by quantifying \n\nthe degree of attenuation of a radiant beam which focuses on the particles suspended in a \n\nparticle/solvent system. This measurement is made in the directly transmitted beam, i.e. upon \n\nthe loss of intensity of transmitted light due to the scattering effect of particles caused by the \n\nfinely divided suspended objects.  \n\n(i) Equipment and measurements  \n\nFigure 2.1 shows the instrumental design generally used on this technique. Here the \n\nlight passes through a filter creating a light beam of known wavelength that passes through a \n\ncuvette containing the dispersion. In this procedure, the decrease in the radiation\u2019s transmitted \n\npower is measured. If a beam of light is passed through a turbid sample its intensity is reduced \n\nby scattering and the quantity of scattered light is dependent upon the concentration and size \n\ndistribution of the particles [78]. For instrumental measurement it is advisable to ensure that \n\nsettling of the particles being measured will be negligible [78, 79]. In order to have consistent \n\nresults variables must be carefully controlled, such as the used wavelength and extremely \n\ndilute suspensions may be measured [78].  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Optical arrangements of turbidimetry [80]. \n\nTurbidimetric measurements permit analyze the amount of sediment in a liquid which \n\nmakes the use of this technique particularly usefully on the assessment of precipitates formed \n\nby the interaction of very dilute solutions or other particulate matter [78]. As that turbidimetry \n\nis used in order to study the obtained CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 dispersed particles stability. This \n\ntechnique works as a technical consolidation of the visual analysis, being much more efficient \n\nand accurate, as would be expected, since it lowers, in large-scale, the human error.  \n\nDetector UV/Visible\n\nSpectrophotometer\n\n\n\n \n\n3 3  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n2.4 Attenuated Total Reflectance  \n\nAttenuated total reflectance (ATR) is a sampling technique used in conjunction with \n\ninfrared (IR) spectroscopy enabling samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid \n\nstate, with minimal preparation. This technique, typically performed within a few seconds, \n\nallows the obtainment of structural information from the surface and measurement of thin \n\nlayers (surface characterization) [81, 82]. \n\n(i) Equipment and measurements  \n\nATR is based on the phenomenon of total internal reflection and measures the changes \n\nthat occur in an internally reflected infrared beam that comes into contact with the sample \n\nthrough the ATR crystal (diamond, in this case). When a sample is placed in contact with the \n\ndiamond the resulting evanescent wave is attenuated in the regions of the IR spectrum where \n\nthe sample absorbs energy, being the powder directed placed on the sampling plate over the \n\noptic window (just enough amount to cover it (mm)) noticing that the sample thickness does \n\nnot affect the intensity of the absorbance bands and it is in direct contact with the ATR crystal \n\n[81, 83, 84]. Figure 2.2 illustrates the ATR principle.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 ATR principle. Internal reflections through an ATR crystal.  \n\nDue the internal reflectance to the crystal only a fraction of light reaches into the \n\nsample. The penetration depth depends on the wavelength, the refractive indices ( ) of the \n\nATR crystal and the sample (                    ) and the angle of the entering light beam \n\n(typically 45\no \n\nrelative to the crystal surface) [81, 84, 85]. In regions of the IR spectrum where \n\nthe sample absorbs energy the evanescent wave will be attenuated or altered by the sample \n\nand the reflected radiation is returned to the detector.  \n\nDiamond is an ideal crystal material for routine measurements on a wide range of \n\nsamples since it possesses extreme chemical and mechanical robustness and durability and it \n\nis chemically inert [81, 82, 84]. \n\nATR provides excellent data quality combined with the highest reproducibility of any \n\nIR sampling technique. The improved spectral acquisition and reproducibility associated with \n\nthis technique leads to better quality database building for more precise material verification \n\nCaCO3 and Ca(OH)2\npowders in contact with \n\nthe evanescent wave\n\nDetector\n\nATR Crystal\n\n(Diamond)\n\nInfrared \n\nbeam\n\n\n\n \n\n3 4  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nand identification. However, there are some potential drawbacks to using this technique, \n\nnamely the cost of the optics and ATR element is relatively fragile and should be handled \n\nwith care [81-85].  \n\nIn order to study the chemical nature of the CaCO3 (0.0% and 5.0% DA) powders \n\nsamples were used ATR technique. This procedure provides an important idea about the \n\nreaction effectiveness, i.e. it allows analyzing the final product reaction in order to understand \n\nwhat it is constituted by.  \n\n2.5 X-ray techniques  \n\nX-ray analysis includes two main techniques. X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry \n\nwhich is based on the measurement of the characteristic X-ray (XR) emission energies and \n\nworks on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of elements with high atomic numbers \n\n(typically, Z>13). On the other hand X-ray powder Diffraction (XRD) uses diffraction data \n\nobtained by the study of structure-dependent scattering phenomena. Here, the shapes and \n\npositions of diffraction peaks can be used to establish a wide range of physical properties, \n\nnamely stress, texture, crystallinity and particle size and phase identification.  \n\n2.5.1 X-ray Fluorescence  \n\nX-ray Fluorescence (XRF) technique is governed by the photoelectric effect. According \n\nto this principle, a high energetic radiation is used to ionize the atoms present in a sample, \n\ninducing the ejection of an electron from its atomic position and creating a vacancy on a fully \n\noccupied inner shell. In order to the atom revert to its stable state two different processes may \n\noccur. In the first case a rearrangement of the atom may occur originating the emission of a \n\nsecond electron (Auger effect). While the second process is based on the transference of an \n\nelectron from an outer electron to fill the free internal vacancy, emitting a photon and \n\noriginating the X-ray fluorescence phenomenon (Figure 2.3). This process repeat and series \n\nof photons will be emitted until a free electron replaces an outermost valence spot so the atom \n\nreturns to the ground state. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Schematics of X-ray Fluorescence phenomena.  \n\nEph=Ef-Ei\n\nEph=E1-E0=K?\n\nEph=E2-E0=K?\n\nor\n\nE3\n\ne-\n\nEAe=E3-E0-E4\n\nAuger \n\nelectron\n\nE4\n\nIncoming \n\nradiation \n\nfrom \n\nX-ray tube \n\n\n\n \n\n3 5  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nThe kinetic energy of the emitted X-ray photon (Eph) depends and corresponds to the \n\nenergy difference between the shell\u00b4s final (Ef) and initial (Ei) binding energies. Because this \n\ndifference is characteristic for every element the excited atoms emit characteristic radiation \n\n(Figure 2.4).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 X-ray emission lines, particularly K and L radiation and its respective notations according Siegbahn \n\nand IUPAC rules.  \n\nMoreover the energy of X-ray lines depends on the atomic number of the emitting atom \n\nbeing this relation translated by the Henry Moseley\u2019s law (Equation 2.1) [86, 87]:  \n\n \n\n \n         \n\n \nEquation 2.1 \n\nwhere   is the wavelength of the characteristic emission to the atomic number Z and   and   \n\nare constants values specific for the energy distribution levels and sublevels involved in a \n\ngiven transition. Note that K lines are generally more intense.  \n\nThe energy of Auger electrons (EAe) depend on the energy difference between the \n\nvacancy and the jumping level but also on the binding energy of the emitted electron. Both \n\nprocesses (emissions of X-ray photons and Auger electrons) are competing. As that their \n\nprobability is complementary and the chance of Auger effect occur increases with a decrease \n\nin the difference between the energy states (highest for low Z elements) [86, 88].  \n\nIt is important to notice that X-rays have different interactions with the material, namely \n\nabsorption and scattering.  \n\nEnergy Level                                                                                                              Electronic Configuration\n\nK?1\n(L3K)\n\nK?2\n(L2K)\n\nK?1\n(M3K)\n\nK?3\n(M2K)\n\nL?1\n(M5L3)\n\nL?2\n(M4L3) L?3\n\n(M3L1)\n\nL?1\n(M4L2)\n\nL?2\n(N2L3)\n\nL?2\n(N2L1)\n\nL?1\n(N4L2)\n\n1s\n\n2p\n\n2s\n\n2p\n\n3p\n\n3s\n\n3p\n\n3d\n\n3d\n\n4s\n\n\u2026\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nL3\n\nM2\nM1\n\nM3\n\nM4\n\nM5\n\nN1\n\nL2\nL1\n\nK\n\n\u2026\n\n(b)\n\nSiegbahn notation (by Manne Siegbahn)\n\nIUPAC (International Union of Pure and \n\nAp plied Chemistry) notation\n\n\n\n \n\n3 6  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nAbsorption occurs when the incoming radiation is absorbed in the sample and has to be \n\nconsidered as two different interactions. The first one is described by the Lambert-Beer law \n\n(Figure 2.5 and Equation 2.2) where I0 is the incident radiation and I is the transmitted one, \n\nnoticing that the intensity is reduced by exponential function in dependence of mass \n\nabsorption coefficient ?, thickness of the layer d and density ? on the sample [86, 89]. And \n\nsecondly as the absorption of fluorescence radiation on the way to the sample surface, which \n\ndescribes the information depth of XRF and heat up the sample.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Absorption and dissipation (in all angles) of electromagnetic radiation.  \n\nOn the other hand, scattering results from the interaction of X-ray photons with the \n\nelectrons of the target element, changing their direction and possibly loosing energy. Two \n\nmain types of scattering take place in the photon-atom interaction: Compton (incoherent or \n\ninelastic) and Rayleigh (coherent or elastic) scattering. On Compton effect (Figure 2.6 (a)) \n\nthe incoming photon is scattered on a weakly bonded electron that can take over a part its \n\nenergy being the radiation characterized by a slightly lower energy compared to that from the \n\nincoming beam. In case of Rayleigh effect (Figure 2.6 (b)) no energy is lost in the collision \n\nprocess once it is a result of photons scattering on strongly bonded electrons. These electrons \n\ncan only oscillate with the frequency of the incident photon. As no energy change is involved \n\nthe Rayleigh radiation will retain exactly the same energy as the incident beam.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Compton (a) and Rayleigh (b) scattering effects.  \n\nBecause of these phenomena, in addition to the characteristic radiation of the elements \n\npresent in the irradiated sample, the XRF spectrum presents peaks that correspond to a \n\nCompton and Rayleigh scatters of the incident beam. Even more, Rayleigh scatter peaks are \n\nIncident \n\nradiation\n\nI0\n\nTransmitted \n\nradiation\n\nI\n\nCompton Rayleigh\n\n(a) (b)\n\n       \n         Equation 2.2 \n\n\n\n \n\n3 7  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\ncharacterized by sharp shapes that correspond to the characteristic energies of the incident \n\nbeam while Compton peaks are wider and located at slightly lower energies. Intensity of \n\nscattered is dependent on the average atomic number and on the density and the thickness of \n\nthe sample being irradiated, as consequence light elements give rise to high Compton effects \n\nand low Rayleigh scatter [87, 90]. \n\nDue to its versatility XRF technique is widely used in chemistry, biology, forensic \n\nscience, engineering, agriculture, clinical chemistry, cultural heritage and many other fields \n\n[89]. Some of its benefits and drawbacks are related with a low spectral background caused \n\nby scattered tube radiation and the relatively simple instrumentation; and the low spatial \n\nresolution originated by the impossibility for focusing the X-rays [86].  \n\nNormally, XRF measurements are referred to bulk analysis [90]. However the two main \n\npoints to consider in relation with the penetration depth are the depth of penetration of the \n\nprimary X-ray beam into the sample and the escape depth from which fluorescent X-rays can \n\nbe detected. Both of these are directly linked to the energy of the X-rays: the higher the X-ray \n\nenergy the deeper the X-ray penetrates. Moreover, X-rays penetration depth can vary from \n\nmicrometers down to several millimetres, depending on the sample matrix [91]. \n\nThe lighter elements (e.g. Al, Si) have very low energy X-rays and thus will be difficult \n\nto detect even at relatively small depths within the sample. Heavier elements (e.g. Cu, Ag) \n\nhave much more energetic X-rays which will be able to pass through large distances within \n\nthe sample. So, heavy elements (i.e. energetic fluorescent XR) will be detectable relatively \n\ndeep within a sample matrix primarily comprised of light elements (i.e. low absorption) and \n\nlight elements will be detectable only at the surface of a sample matrix comprised of heavy \n\nelements [91].  \n\n(i) Equipment  \n\nIn the present study a micro Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (?-EDXRF) \n\nspectrometer is used. This is an analytical method with sensitive elemental analysis of \n\n(non)homogeneous material that focus the incident radiation (by introducing appropriate \n\nfocusing optics) to a much smaller size spot (\u00b5m/nm scale) on the sample [86, 87]. The \n\nequipment consists in two basic units: the excitation source and the spectrometer detection \n\nsystem. Here the detector can be very close to the sample so a high amount of fluorescence \n\nradiation can be captured [86]. The sample chamber operates under vacuum, which is a \n\ncrucial condition in the determination of light elements.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n3 8  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nDetector  \n\nDetectors transform the emerging energy of the X-ray photons into electric pulses \n\n(counts) detecting both fluorescence radiation and scattering.

SDD are developed with a cylindrically symmetric structure that \n\ngenerates the electrical field for charge carrier collection, guiding the electrons through the \n\ndetector and reducing the entrance capacity for the preamplifier, dropping the electronic noise \n\nin the detector and, consequently, reducing the filter which means that count rates can be \n\nenhanced guarantying very high count rates and good energy resolutions [86-88]. It is made in \n\nhighly pure silicon with a very low leakage current [87].  \n\nAt this point it is important to define some main criteria for the detection system \n\n(detector plus amplifier and multichannel analyzer) evaluation. Resolution is the ability of the \n\ndetector to distinguish between different photons with very close energies. It influences the \n\nselectivity of the methodology and is estimated by the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) \n\n[87, 88]. The detector efficiency is defined as the percentage of ionizing radiation reaching \n\nthe detector (higher number of pulses, higher number of incoming photons, higher efficiency). \n\nIt depends on the detector size and shape, the distance from it to the sample, the absorption of \n\nradiation before it reaches the detector and the backscatter radiation toward it [87]. Finally, \n\nsensitivity corresponds to the capability to produce a usable pulse for a given type of radiation \n\nand energy. This parameter depends on the detector cross-section and its volume, the detector \n\nwindow and the intrinsic detector noise [88].  \n\nAdditional peaks (spectrum artifacts) can arise in an XRF spectrum from sources other \n\nthan the meaningful elements in the sample and due the photoelectric events that occur deep \n\ninside the detector. It is important to be aware of the nature of these events in order to get \n\nquality analytical results once they contribute to the full energy peak [87, 88]. For events \n\nwhich occur near the surface, there is a significant probability that the characteristic X-ray \n\nescapes and the corresponding amount of energy is lost from the signal. The atoms in a \n\ndetector (Si, in this work) will also emit their own characteristic radiation when struck by the \n\nincoming X-ray beam. The majority of this radiation is immediately absorbed within the \n\ndetector and not contributes to the overall charge collected [87]. The result of this escape \n\nprocess is an escape peak located at an energy value lower than the parent peak and \n\nequivalent to the difference between the energy of the original photon and the energy of the \n\nline of the detector element [87, 88]. These artifacts could be reduced by preventing the \n\nincident radiation from interacting in the periphery of the detector by means of collimation \n\n[88]. Other common spectral artifacts are sum peaks. They are the result of the high-intensity \n\n\n\n \n\n3 9  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\npeaks that arrive to the detector so close together in time that the pileup inspector cannot \n\nrecognize them as two events; therefore the energy of the resulting peak is the sum of the two \n\ninitial energies and it effect is for the signals to be seen as only one [87, 88]. Finally, \n\nbackground artifact, which is mainly due to coherent and incoherent scattering, already \n\nexposed. It shape can be complex and depends on the initial shape of the excitation spectrum \n\nand on the sample composition as well as on the incomplete charge collection of intense \n\nfluorescence lines in the spectrum [88]. Figure 2.7 presents some spectrum artifacts detected \n\non the present work, namely the copper escape peak, the Compton effect, as well as the \n\ncharacteristic signals from the equipment (Zr) and X-ray tube (Rayleigh scatter-Rh).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 Spectrum artifacts and characteristic signals from the used equipment.  \n\nX-ray tube  \n\nIn a X-ray tube a beam of emitted electrons, generated by heating up the spiral filament \n\n(cathode), are accelerated by a strong electric field against a target (anode) placed inside a \n\nvacuum housing [86-88]. The energy of the characteristic radiation of the XR tube is \n\ndetermined by the element from which the anode is made, while the continuous radiation \n\ndepends on the applied voltage, the current and on the anode material used [87]. This process \n\ngenerates high energetic electromagnetic radiation: X-rays.  \n\nX-ray tube windows are normally made of beryllium (Be) because of its high \n\ntransmission for low energy XR, however Be is a poor conductor so if a window is too thin it \n\ncan lead to fracture [88]. Even more, in a side-window tube the electrons hit the target with an \n\nangle that is different to 90\u00ba and the distance from target to window has to be relatively large \n\nto avoid the heating of the window [86, 88].  \n\n1.E+01\n\n1.E+02\n\n1.E+03\n\n1.E+04\n\n1.E+05\n\n1.E+06\n\n5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n/c\n\no\nu\n\nn\nts\n\n p\ne\nr\n s\n\ne\nc\no\n\nn\nd\n\n \n\nEnergy/keV\n\nRayleigh scatter\n\nC\nu\n\n e\nsc\n\na\np\n\ne\n p\n\ne\na\n\nk\n\nCompton effect \n\nR\nh\n\nK\n?\n\nZ\nr \n\nK\n?\n\nC\nu\n\nK\n?\n\nC\nu\n\n K\n?\n\nR\nh\n\nK\n?\n1\n\nZ\nr\n\nK\n?\n\nCu escape peak:\n\nEph + ESi = Epeak\nESi=1.74 keV\n\nR\nh\n\nK\n?\n\n2\n\n1.E+01\n\n1.E+02\n\n1.E+03\n\n1.E+04\n\n1.E+05\n\n1.E+06\n\n5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n/c\n\no\nu\n\nn\nts\n\n p\ne\nr\n s\n\ne\nc\no\n\nn\nd\n\n \n\nEnergy/keV\n\nRayleigh scatter\n\nC\nu\n\n e\nsc\n\na\np\n\ne\n p\n\ne\na\n\nk\n\nCompton effect \n\nR\nh\n\nK\n?\n\nZ\nr \n\nK\n?\n\nC\nu\n\nK\n?\n\nC\nu\n\n K\n?\n\nR\nh\n\nK\n?\n1\n\nZ\nr\n\nK\n?\n\nCu escape peak:\n\nEph + ESi = Epeak\nESi=1.74 keV\n\nR\nh\n\nK\n?\n\n2\n\n\n\n \n\n4 0  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nOptics  \n\nConcerning cultural heritage related objects X-ray optics devices are a great \n\nimprovement as it resolves tiny details both lateral and in depth [90]. With these devices it \n\nshould be possible to change the direction and/or the energetic distribution of the radiation \n\n[86]. However, its application is limited when elements with very low concentrations present \n\nin a sample have to be determined [87].  \n\nThe use of capillary lens shape and direct the primary X-ray beam that impinges on the \n\nlens\u00b4 surface and propagates thorough the system, emerging in a convergent beam with high \n\nintensity [87]. Particularly, polycapillary systems, prepared from bundles of very thin single \n\ncapillaries (inner diameter of 1\u20132 ?m), are used in order to obtain a larger intensity gain \n\nwithin the focal spot [86, 87].  \n\n(ii) Qualitative and quantitative analysis \n\nSpectra resulting from this technique allow analytical information about the sample in \n\norder to ascertain the elements present in the target sample (qualitative analysis) and/or their \n\ncontent quantification (quantitative analysis).  \n\nThe position of the characteristic X-ray emitted energies on the spectrum determines the \n\nelements present in the sample. In order to get meaningful and qualitative quality analytical \n\nresults it is important to take into account all the spectrum characteristics and artifacts [87].  \n\nQuantitative XRF analysis takes into account the heights of the peaks once they are \n\nrelated to the element concentrations. This evaluation involves both the conversion of the net \n\nanalytical signs to the analytes concentrations as well as the elements peaks correction for the \n\nspectral background and possible overlaps by background correction and deconvolution, \n\nrespectively. Quantitative analysis when using ?-EDXRF generates relatively large errors. As \n\nthat these results should be considered as semi-quantitative. The resulting information about \n\nthe elements content in the sample is relative and indicative, so extra care is important for the \n\ndata treatment.  \n\nStatistical treatment on the analytical results is necessary since the heterogeneities and \n\nthe modifications of the corrosive conditions can led to variation in the composition of the \n\ncorrosion products. This topic will be further discussed on Chapter 4.  \n\n(iii) Measurements  \n\n?-EDXRF is used in order to investigate the coins elemental constitution \n\nsemi-quantifying the elements that constitute its surface and bulk. Based on historical \n\ninformation the possibility of the studied coins had been silver enriched need to be \n\n\n\n \n\n4 1  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\ninvestigated. As that is important to notice that regardless the origin of silver enrichment, the \n\nenriched layer plays a decisive role in the ?-EDXRF analysis results. If the thickness of \n\nenriched layers is greater than the depth under study only the composition of this layer is \n\naccessible [33]. Moreover, when the surface silver content is several times higher with respect \n\nto the amount of the bulk, this result suggests that the coin had been intentionally silver \n\nsurface enriched. Even though, the major problem in analysing antique plated coins is \n\nwhether it is possible to indisputably distinguish intentional silvering from the phenomenon of \n\nsurface enrichment resulting from long-term selective corrosion.  \n\n2.5.2 X-ray Diffraction  \n\nA crystal can be defined as a homogeneous and anisotropic body, having the natural \n\nshape of a polyhedron and where a typical 3D regular arrangement of atoms represented by \n\nthe smallest repeating unit showing the full symmetry of the crystal structure (unit cell) can be \n\nseen. Lattice planes are defined from shape and dimensions of the unit cell. These planes are \n\nimaginary and provide a reference grid to which the atoms in the crystal structure may be \n\nreferred [92, 93].  \n\nX-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis is a versatile technique for examining, identify and \n\ncharacterize almost any crystalline material, whether inorganic or organic through the use of \n\nX-rays [92, 94]. Since every ordered material is made up of a unique arrangement and number \n\nof atoms it will give a diffraction pattern that is, to all intents and purposes, also unique [92]. \n\nThis fact introduces the concept of finger printing on X-ray Diffraction analysis, one of the \n\nmost important ones on the identification of unknown materials.  \n\nThe operative equation in XRD is the Bragg equation (Equation 2.3):  \n\n            Equation 2.3 \n\nwhere n is the order of a reflection,   the wavelength, d the distance between parallel lattice \n\nplanes and   the angle between the incident beam and the lattice plane, known as the Bragg \n\nangle.         represents the path length in the crystal. When its value is a multiple of the \n\nwavelength constructive interference occurs and diffracted intensity is obtained [94]. Bragg\u00b4s \n\nLaw is represented in Figure 2.8. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 2  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 Illustration of Bragg\u00b4s Law [94].  \n\nThe two basic parameters being used in this search/match process are the d values, \n\ncalculated from the measured 2  values in the diffractogram, and the relative intensities of the \n\nlines in the pattern. d-spacing is a function of the lattice parameters (a,b,c) and angles (?,?,?) \n\nthat define the unit cell; and the Miller indices (h,k,l) denoting a particular reflection. Each \n\nfamily plans is separated by a specific d gap whose value allows identifying a particular and \n\nunique plan, so the main structure has a characteristic set of interplanar distances d. As such, \n\nit is the geometry of the crystal lattice that determines the positions of the peaks in its \n\ndiffraction pattern. In general, the more symmetrical the material, the fewer peaks in its \n\ndiffraction pattern [94]. X-ray diffraction is thus capable of providing general purpose \n\nqualitative and quantitative information on the presence of phases (e.g., compounds) in an \n\nunknown mixture [92].  \n\n(i) Equipment and measurements  \n\nPowder diffractometer systems have a geometric arrangement (Figure 2.9) known as \n\nthe Bragg\u2013Brentano parafocusing system and is typified by a diverging beam from a line \n\nsource F (X-ray source), falling onto the specimen S, which is diffracted and passes through a \n\nreceiving slit R, to the detector, passing along a two-circle goniometer (A). Distances FA and \n\nAR are equal. The amount of divergence is determined by the effective focal width of the \n\nsource and the aperture of the divergence slit D. The equipment control and data collect and \n\nanalysis are made on a computer [92, 94].  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Geometry of the Bragg\u2013Brentano diffractometer [92].  \n\nLegend: F-source; P and PR-Soller slits; S-sample; D- divergence slit; R- receiving slit. The axis of the goniometer \n\nis at A. \n\n\n\n \n\n4 3  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nBy synchronizing the scanning speed of the goniometer with the recorder diffractogram \n\n(a plot of 2   intensity vs degrees) is obtained. The goniometer can be used in two different \n\nconfigurations:  /2   (sample stage vs detector) or  /   (tube vs detector). Moreover, this \n\ndevice may be oriented to keep the sample horizontal or vertical [94]. A diffracted beam \n\nmonochromator may also be used in order to improve signal-to-noise characteristics. Finally, \n\nin Crooks tube a tungsten wire exerts pressure on the poles increasing the pressure between \n\nthe cathode and the anode and releasing a cathode ray beam that collides with the metal target.  \n\nA large data base (either computed or in paper) of pure single-phase materials is \n\nnormally available so that rapid empirical file-searching techniques can be employed for \n\nmeasuring phases (compounds) [92, 94]. The diffractogram is reduced to a list of d-spacing\u2019s \n\nand intensity values and then submitted for file search/matching [92]. \n\nWith relation to the set of studied coins this technique is used in order to identify \n\ncrystalline unknown compounds. In this case, the work is particularly complex and prolonged \n\ndue to the lack of information about the patina constituents\u2019 compounds. Even more, being \n\ncompleted unknown the coins origin. The application of this technique to 0.0% and 5.0% DA \n\nCaCO3 powders works in the opposite way. XRD is used, on this case, in order to examine the \n\ncomponents crystal structure allowing identifying the presence of crystalline compounds and \n\ntheir phases. Here XRD is used to confirm the already known compounds that are present in \n\nthe powders.  \n\n2.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy / Energy Dispersive X-ray \n\nSpectroscopy \n\nThe Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) sweeps the solid surface, according to the \n\noperator command, with a focused high energy electron beam that interacts with atoms on the \n\nsample surface producing various signals that can be detected and which are translated into \n\n2D images of the object showing its spatial properties variations [95]. The signals that derive \n\nfrom electron-sample interactions reveal information about the morphology (texture and \n\ntopographical) and chemical composition (in microanalysis detail) [96, 97] of the object. This \n\napproach is especially useful in qualitatively or semi-quantitatively analyses. Even more, \n\nSEM technique reveals levels of detail and complexity inaccessible by light microscopy and it \n\ncreates precise measurements of very small features and objects down to 50 nm [96, 97]. \n\nSEM is routinely used to generate high-resolution images of shapes on objects and to \n\nshow spatial variations in chemical compositions acquiring elemental maps or spot chemical \n\nanalyses when coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). \n\n\n\n \n\n4 4  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n(i) Equipment and measurements  \n\nFigure 2.10 shows the SEM inside structure. It comprises an electron generating \n\ncomponent (gun) fitted, generally, with a tungsten filament cathode at the top; a column down \n\nwhich the electron beam travels; a series of lenses to shape the electron beam; the sample \n\nchamber at the base; a series of pumps to keep the system under vacuum; a computer that \n\ndrives the microscope, with the additional bench controls; and an ancillary equipment to, for \n\nexample, composition analyses [97]. This device runs on all axes allowing analyzing the \n\nsample in any perspective [95]. Note that EDS detectors cannot detect very light elements \n\n(e.g. H or Li). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 \u2013 Schematic figure on Scanning Electron Microscopy [98]. \n\nSample preparation can be minimal depending on the nature of the samples and the data \n\nrequired. However, the objects must be solid, fit into the microscope chamber and stable in a \n\nvacuum.  \n\nThis technique is used on both surface samples, i.e. for the evaluation on the \n\nconservation state of the antique Portuguese dinheiros as well as in the nanoparticles\u00b4 \n\ncharacterization for cultural heritage conservation, in the same way. On coins, the SEM/EDS \n\nis applied in order to study their corroded surface allowing to evaluate the degradation \n\nphenomena extent and punctually quantifying the elemental composition in several specific \n\nspots. In the 0.0% and 5.0% DA CaCO3 synthesized powders the goal is to analyze their \n\nsurfaces, identifying the morphology changes and realize the size (nano or not) of the \n\nparticles.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPART I \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEVALUATION ON THE DEGRADATION STATE OF \n\nANTIQUE COINS BY SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n4 7  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n3 EXPERIMENTAL PART \n\nA set of six dinheiros dated from the first Portuguese dynasty (13\nrd\n\n and 14\nth \n\ncenturies) \n\nwere chosen to be analyzed by means of ?-EDXRF, XRD and SEM/EDS.  \n\n3.1 Coins visual analysis: a macro scale morphologic approach  \n\nFrom the historical point of view coins are classified in different series based on their \n\nnumismatic characteristics.

The X-ray generator was operated at 50 kV and 600 \u00b5A and a \n\ncomposition of filters was used to reduce background (100 \u00b5m Al/ 50 \u00b5m Ti/ 25 \u00b5m Cu). \n\nDetection of fluorescence radiation is performed by energy dispersive Silicon-Drift-Detector \n\nwith 30 mm\u00b2 sensitive area and energy resolution of 142 eV for Mn-K?.

The present chapter \n\npresents a complete discussion of the obtained results.  \n\n4.1 Coins visual analysis: a macro scale morphologic approach  \n\nThe examination on the surface of the coins helps understanding the composition of the \n\nsubstrate and its patina compounds. However it does not allows to assume their composition \n\nbut, on a general point of view, could be an useful criteria in order to be aware of the coin \n\nhistory. \n\nThe general appearance of the coins and the main observations on each face is described \n\non Table 4.1.  \n\nIt could be concluded that all the coins were well preserved taking into account their \n\ndating period (13\nrd\n\n and 14\nth\n\n centuries). The only exceptions were on 257 R, 283 R and 500 R, \n\nparticularly, 275 R which presents a typical and local \u201ccauliflower\u201d corrosion area.  \n\nGenerally, well defined surfaces with black-brownish coloration were observed in all \n\nthe coins.

The beam \n\npenetration depth is dependent on the sample matrix \u2013 heavier elements have more \n\nenergetic X-rays, which will be able to pass through large distances within the sample \n\nand hence can be produced deeper inside the bulk. On the other hand, if a coin has a \n\nvery thick patina layer the incident radiation has to cross this coating before the bulk. In \n\nany case, elements Z>13, such as carbon and oxygen, are undetectable by XRF \n\ntechnique.  \n\nFigure 4.1 presents the obtained results (element identification and copper \n\nquantification) when two points on the same coin, particularly 283 coin, where \n\ncompared. The point\u2019s choice was based on its visual similar characteristics, i.e. the \n\nposition on the coin, high relief and presented colours (both identified by the white \n\ncircles on the figure).  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 3  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 \u00b5-EDXRF spectra and images obtained on 283 coin for pt.1 (blue line) and pt.2 (red line). \n\nCopper quantification on both points.  \n\nBased on these results it can be concluded that iron (Fe), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), \n\nbismuth (Bi), silver (Ag), antimony (Sb) and copper (Cu) were identified on both \n\nspectra. Furthermore, the similarity on the copper content on both points \n\n(Cu > 96 wt.%) is clear.  \n\nIn fact, the main differences between both spectra were the peaks significance for \n\nthe light elements, such as silicon (Si), phosphorus (P), sulphur (S), chlorine (Cl), \n\ncalcium (Ca) and strontium (Sr). These variations are particularly important since it \n\nallows to demonstrate the differences between the presence, or not, of exogenous \n\nelements on the analysis. Si, P, S, Cl, Ca and Sr were present on the coin surface due \n\nenvironmental contamination or as corrosion products, being part of the patina layer and \n\nnot as constituents of the alloy. This topic will be further discussed.

As \n\nconsequence of the proved existence of these \u201ccontaminants\u201d on the coin surface, the \n\nspectra representing the remaining studied coins were chosen based on its elemental \n\nquantifications in order to reduce, as much as possible, the presence of elements such as \n\nSi, P, S, Cl, Ca or Sr. This choice allowed to present, in the best way possible, the bulk \n\nconstitutions.  \n\nThe obtained quantifications should be taken carefully, as previously exposed. \n\nParameters such as the standard deviation and the relative standard deviation (RSD) as \n\nwell as the Limit of Detection (LOD) are very important is the method and results \n\nevaluation. Annexe II presents the detailed information and formulas in order to \n\naccomplish the data treatment according to the literature [87, 99-102].  \n\n4.2.1 Limit of Detection  \n\nThe signal at the Limit of Detection (LOD) is derived from the smallest measure \n\nthat can be detected with reasonable certainty for a given analytical procedure. The \n\nvalue of LOD, for \u00b5-EDXRF is given by the Equation 4.1 [87, 99]:  \n\n    \n      \n\n  \n \n\n \nEquation 4.1 \n\nwhere    is the concentration of the element i and    and    are the counting rates for \n\nthe background and for the peak, respectively.  \n\nIn practice, the limit of detection represents the level below which cannot be \n\nconfident whether or not the element is actually present. It follows from this that no \n\nanalytical method can ever conclusively prove that a particular chemical substance is \n\nnot present in a sample, only whether it cannot be detected [100]. LOD is better when \n\nthe background is less, the instrumental sensitivity increases, and through longer \n\ncounting times [87].  \n\nTable 4.3 presents the calculated LOD\u00b4s by the measure of the CRM 32X SN7. \n\nTable 4.3 \u2013 LOD values obtained by \u00b5-EDXRF on CRM 32X SN7 (wt.%).  \n\n \nCu As Ag Sb Pb Bi Sn Zn Co Ni \n\nLOD 1.0x10\n-2\n\n 2.9x10\n-3\n\n 2.2x10\n-2\n\n 3.3x10\n-2\n\n 5.5x10\n-3\n\n 4.1x10\n-3\n\n 3.3x10\n-2\n\n 5.7x10\n-3\n\n 5.5x10\n-3\n\n 8.2x10\n-3\n\n \n\n \n\u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \n\nU(LOD)\na)b)\n\n 1.8x10\n-5\n\n 1.6x10\n-4\n\n 1.5x10\n-3\n\n 3.8x10\n-3\n\n 3.0x10\n-4\n\n 5.2x10\n-4\n\n 5.9x10\n-4\n\n 1.2x10\n-4\n\n 2.0x10\n-4\n\n 3.2x10\n-4\n\n \na)\n k = 2,for a confidence level of, approximately, 95%.  \n\nb)\n the relative uncertainty of     was neglected in the combined uncertainty calculation.  \n\n\n\n \n\n5 5  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Coins analysis  \n\nSince the elemental quantification on each point varies with the number of \n\nelements detected and selected on each spectrum, the final error on the results takes this \n\ninto account. On practice, these errors can be minimized by reporting the mean value of \n\nthe quantifications however they can be assumed only as representative of the total \n\ncontent of each element.  \n\nThe individual \u00b5-EDXRF spectra and elemental quantification for each one of the \n\nstudied dinheiros are present on Figures A.III.1 to A.III.6 and Tables A.III.1 to \n\nA.III.6 on Annexe A.III.1. The complete chemical composition of the patina layer and \n\nof the bulk metal of the samples and the respective statistical treatment is presented on \n\nTable A.III.7 on the same Annexe.  \n\nSeveral elements were identified and quantified as constituents of the studied \n\ndinheiros, being part of its billon alloy or as patina constituents. The obtained results \n\nshowed that copper was the main component in the all of them, followed by silver and \n\nsome minor elements, namely Si (non-detected only on sample 257), Fe, Pb, Sb, As, Ca, \n\nP, Cl, S and K (all with contents > 0.11 wt.%), bismuth (Bi), gold (Au), mercury (Hg), \n\ntitanium (Ti) and Sr (contents &lt;0.09 wt.%) when detected. However Ag is a \n\nparticularly case of study.  \n\nTable 4.4 presents a resume on the copper and silver contents. These are the main \n\nelements under study once, historically, the set coins should be made on billon alloy \u2013 \n\ncopper/silver.  \n\nTable 4.4 \u2013 Copper and silver contents (wt.%) on the studied set of dinheiros.  \n\nCoin Kingdom \nElement quantification (wt.%) \n\nCu \n \n\nAg \n275 D.

On the other hand, the silver content had a different \n\nbehaviour. As a result two different groups of coins, regarding this element \n\nquantification could be established: the first group (G1) constituted by coins with the \n\ncatalogue numbers 275, 279, 280 and 257, with high contents of Ag varying from \n\n11.0 wt.% to 7.0 wt.%; and a second one (G2) which the coins numbered 283 and 500 \n\n(dated from D. Fernando I reign) belonged. G2 presented a silver content that varied \n\nbetween 0.3 wt.% to 0.1 wt.%.  \n\nAccording to these results it can be assigned that even though G1 and G2 were \n\nconstituted by a similar billon alloy, the coins from D. Fernando I period of reign were \n\nweakened. These results are in accordance with the historical information at that date. \n\nThe economical situation of the country was well demonstrated by the fact that the \n\nsilver content between 0.24 wt.% and 0.25 wt.% did not corresponded to the legal one: \n\n2.78 wt.% [12]. These coins are composed by a billon alloy with a low content in silver.  \n\nThe presented results were compared with the ones obtained by Guerra et al. [12]. \n\nThese authors concluded that during the first dynasty, the average fineness corresponds \n\nto the legal one from D. Afonso Henriques to D. Pedro I. However, for D. Fernando I \n\nthey registered exactly the same behaviour. Table 4.5 compares the legal values and the \n\nresults from Guerra et al.

Silver was also identified, but \n\nit is important to notice the difference in the intensity and the number of lines presented \n\nin both cases. The coins with less silver contents had fewer and less intense Ag peaks.  \n\nBased on the provenance and manufacturing chapters presented on this work \n\nsome relationships can be proposed. Detected elements as Si, Cl, Ca, P and possibly K, \n\nFe and Hg are present on this evaluation as contamination from the surrounding \n\nenvironment.  \n\nCu, Ag, Bi and Au and possible Sb, Pb and Fe can be present as part of the ore, \n\ni.e. they are result of the ore provenance or, in the 3 last cases due to provenance or \n\ntechnology. The presence of lead can be, in fact, justified by the use of this element in \n\norder to achieve a better \"fluidity\" of copper and decrease the melting point of the metal \n\nduring the manufacturing process of the coin [13].

Even more, this element which \n\npresents a cubic crystal system was the most intense peak on the coin with the catalogue \n\nnumber 500. Moreover, cuprite (Cu2O) (that also presents a cubic symmetry) was \n\npresent in all coins and it was the most intense peak for all the remaining dinheiros. In \n\nfact, from the analysis of the total set of obtained patterns it was possible to conclude \n\nthat cuprite is the major product on the samples. This is the first patina compound that is \n\nformed over time.  \n\nOther typical crystalline copper corrosion products were indentified. Tenorite \n\n(CuO) on 275, 279, 257, 283 and 500 coins and malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)2) on 275 and \n\n279, both with a monoclinic symmetry. Nantokite (CuCl) on coins with the catalogue \n\nnumbers 279, 280 and 283 and atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3) on 280 were also recognized. \n\nThese two last compounds present cubic and orthorhombic crystal symmetries, \n\nrespectively.  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 1  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nChlorargyrite, a cubic crystal system of AgCl, was identified on the coins with \n\nhigh silver contents (quantified by ?-EDXRF) and where native silver (identified by \n\nXRD) were present, namely on 275, 279, 280 and 257 (G1) coins. Native silver (cubic \n\nsymmetry) or its degradation products are not present on the coins dated from of \n\nD. Fernando I kingdom (G2).  \n\nOn coin with the catalogue number 283 was also identified native lead (Pb).  \n\nFinally, quartz (SiO2 \u2013 hexagonal symmetry) in all coins expect 500 and calcite \n\n(CaCO3 - rhombohedral crystal system) on this dinheiro were identified too.  \n\nA final note to the fact that no specific support was used in the patterns \n\nacquisition. The coins were directly placed under the sample holder to be analyzed.  \n\n \n\nPatina compounds vs environment:  \n\nTo propose a supported and detailed corrosion mechanism it would be very \n\nimportant the knowledge of the coins provenance as well as a detailed study of the soils \n\nor walls where these objects were found. However this information is absolutely \n\nunknown for the studied set of dinheiros. As a result, it is only possible to try to \n\nestablish a possible relationship between the patina constituents and its probable \n\nsurrounding environment. \n\nBased on patina evolution along time and environment (summarized on Figure \n\n4.6) a relationship between copper and its corrosion products can be notice. In fact, it \n\nseems like that what happened in practice is the interconversion of cuprite according the \n\ndifferent reactions between Cu2O and the environment, originating various patina \n\nproducts: firstly, tenorite and nantokite and then malachite and atacamite. Even more, \n\nCu2O presence may indicate not so aggressive coins\u00b4 environmental exposure or a \n\npossible cleaning once this inner layer is identified as the main patina compound in all \n\ncoins.  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 2  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Main compounds found on patina layers of the studied coins. Possible patina evolution with \n\ntime and environment of exposure and its possible formation reactions.  \n\nAccording to the crystalline identified compounds it is possible that the coins had \n\nbeen in contact with chlorine and/or carbonate rich environments. The presence of \n\nchloride compounds on the coins surface, namely nantokite or atacamite can be due to \n\nmarine proximity.  \n\nIn this Cl\n-\n rich environment silver corrosion products can be formed on copper \n\nenriched areas, namely the observed chlorargyrite, particularly induced by oxygen and \n\nhumidity:  \n\n                        Reaction 1.17  \n\nThis was the only silver crystalline corrosion product identified.  \n\nFinally, the identification of quartz and calcite may be related with some \n\ncrystalline impurities presence on the surface of the coins.  \n\nAs consequence of the so far results, a general stratification scheme on the \n\ninteractions between the metallic surface, its patina components and the surrounding \n\nmarine environment can be suggest (Figure 4.7):  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 \u2013 Possible stratification scheme of species in a Cu corrosion film on marine rich environment.  \n\nCu2O\n\nCu2Cl(OH)3CuCl\n\nCu2CO3(OH)2CuO\nReaction 1.1 \n\nReaction 1.9 \n\nReaction 1.5 Reaction 1.6 \n\n?2\n\n3\nCO\n\n?\nCl\n\nReaction 1.7 \n\nCl-\n\nCu2Cl(OH)3\n\nCuCl\n\nCu2O\n\nCu metal\n\nCu2CO3(OH)2CuO\n\n\n\n \n\n6 3  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Coin 275: a particularly case of study  \n\nCoin with the catalogue number 275 was a particularly case of study once it was \n\nthe only dinheiro with visibly damaged surface.

Cuprite was the most intense peak on 275 O and \n\n275 R1 diffractograms while silver corresponded to the 100 % peak on this particularly \n\ncorroded surface (275 R2).

On the \n\nhigh relief areas this layer revealed the metallic core mixed with possible patina oxides, \n\nchlorides and/or carbonates. This uplayer should be a protective coating patina since \n\nalmost all the coins looked, on a macroscopic scale, well preserved. Furthermore, it was \n\nalso clear the presence of silver and its corrosion products denoting the possible \n\npresence of silver surface enrichment.  \n\nHowever, on a micro and nanometre scale some typical corrosion signs could be \n\nobserved. Figure 4.9 presents some SEM images on the surface of five of the studied \n\ncoins:  \n\n\n\n \n\n6 5  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 SEM images on the surface of five of the studied coins.  \n\nTypical corroded fractures and fissures along the surface could be seen, mainly on \n\n275 and 280 coins (compatible with ?-EDXRF and XRD results). The brittle behaviour \n\non billon alloys is not uncommon. Here, several perpendicular and parallel cracks were \n\nobserved. These fissures caused probably by hydration and dehydration of the corrosion \n\ncomponents are served as a starting point for a localized corrosion. They may also result \n\nfrom changes in volume resulting from corrosion. The conversion of nantokite into \n\natacamite is followed through volume expansion (sample 280) which favours the \n\ntransfer of elements from the environment to the coin surface, promoting its \n\nintergranular corrosion. Moreover, silver corrosion products are extremely aggressive. \n\nAmong others they may have been one of the causes of 275 coin fissures.  \n\nSome black cavities could be identified too (mainly on coins 279 and 283). They \n\nmay had caused leaching and diffusion of copper during the corrosion process.  \n\n283\n\n275\n\n279\n\n279\n\n280 (a) 280 (b)\n\n500\n\n10 \u00b5m 10 \u00b5m\n\n10 \u00b5m\n\n10 \u00b5m 10 \u00b5m\n\n1 \u00b5m\n\n\n\n \n\n6 6  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, SEM images of the uplayer (Figure 4.10) indicate a compact surface \n\non 279(a) and 257 coins and a porous morphology on 275, 279(b), 283 and 500 \n\nsamples.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 - SEM images on the coins surfaces regarding compact (279 (a) and 257) and porous (275, \n\n279(b), 283 and 500) patina layers.  \n\nNote the white flakes on the above figures (4.9 and 4.10).

Moreover, other \n\nparticularly morphologies were also identified, namely Si, Ca and Pb rich phases. \n\nSEM/EDS results can be seen in detail on Annexe A.III.3 (Figures A.III.12 to \n\nA.III.24).  \n\nFigure 4.11 presents some examples of the identified copper and copper oxides \n\nphases:  \n\n                                                 \n\n8\n Remember that G1 is composed by 275, 279, 280 and 257 and G2 by 283 and 500 coins.  \n\n279 (a) 279 (b)\n\n257 283 500\n\n275\n10 \u00b5m 10 \u00b5m 10 \u00b5m\n\n10 \u00b5m 10 \u00b5m10 \u00b5m\n\n\n\n \n\n6 7  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 \u2013 SEM/EDS copper phase examples obtained for 275, 279, 283 and 500.  \n\nMainly copper and oxygen (O) were quantified on a relative ratio of \n\napproximately 2:1. Once the metal is the main alloy constituent the presence of O can \n\nbe related with the patina compounds. Moreover, as cuprite was the main crystalline \n\ncorrosion product identified by XRD it can be concluded that this Cu rich phase is \n\nmainly constituted by Cu, Cu2O or even CuO. However, it should be noticed that not \n\nonly Cu was identified on these spots. Also Si and Cl (both on site (4) and the last one \n\non site (5)) were detected and quantified in contents lower than3.21 wt.%.  \n\nMany of this copper rich areas are surrounded by another phases. For example, \n\nFigure 4.12 presents the identified copper (1) and silver (2) morphologies on coin 257. \n\nOwing the presence of chloride it can be assumed that both phases can be constituted by \n\nmetallic Ag/AgCl and in fewer amounts by metallic Cu/CuCl compounds.

These results are in \n\nconcordance with the ones obtained by ?-EDXRF and XRD. Even more, the presence \n\nof significantly silver contents on large areas on the coins represents a normal behaviour \n\nin the Cu/Ag alloy due to the low solubility of silver on copper, and vice versa, at room \n\ntemperature. During the cooling system, each component is separated in a pure state. \n\nThus formed Ag enriched areas dispersed in the copper matrix, whose size will be \n\ndependent on the cooling rate [14]. However, the manufacture of coins can also promote \n\nmacroscopic or microscopic segregations.  \n\nAt this point it is important to notice that these two different phases (Cu and Ag) \n\ncan be characterized by very different morphologies.

Even more, as can be seen on the \n\ncoin with the catalogue number 500 (Figure 4.15 \u2013 1 mm scale) the major impurity \n\ncontents are located on the low relief areas.

Here, oxygen was detected in all the \n\nanalyzed sites and \u201cdown\u201d in the coin, nickel content increased from (3) to (5). \n\nRegarding to oxygen, is important to notice that on the first point only Cu and O were \n\ndetected, this may justify the Cu2O or CuO presence.  \n\nAn examination of the coins cross-section would be very helpful in the \n\ndetermination of the exact composition of the substrate however conservators hesitate to \n\nremove the corrosion layer (once it could be a protective one) or damage the original \n\npiece.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n7 5  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n5 CONCLUSIONS  \n\nThe combined action of non-destructive analytical techniques of ?-EDXRF, XRD \n\nand SEM/EDS allowed interpreting the nature of patina products formed on the studied \n\nset of six antique Portuguese coins.  \n\nBy the coins visual analysis regarding a macro scale morphologic approach \n\nseveral kind of patinas could be identified, namely a yellow- brownish layer on coins \n\nnumbered 275, 279, 280 and 500 and a green one on 279 coin on the low relief areas; \n\nand a red-brownish coating on 257 coin.  \n\nThe interaction of the environment with the metallic material was also evidenced \n\nby the ?-EDXRF and the SEM/EDS results through the presence of elements such as Si, \n\nCl, Ca, P and possibly K, Fe and Hg outside the alloy composition of the artefact. \n\nMoreover, ?-EDXRF results allowed to admit that Cu, Ag, Bi, Au and possible Sb, Pb \n\nand Fe can be present as part of the ore. In fact, it was verified that all the coins were \n\nmade on billon alloy (copper/silver). However it was historically and scientifically \n\nproven the metal debasement during D. Fernando I period of reign.  \n\nXRD analyses showed the presence of oxides, namely cuprite (Cu2O) in all coins \n\nand tenorite (CuO). In some cases malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)2) and some chlorides, \n\nmainly, nantokite (CuCl) and atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3) were also identified. Moreover, \n\nin the numisms with high silver content, chlorargyrite (AgCl) was identified too (275, \n\n279, 280 and 275).  \n\nThe evolution of corrosion can be assumed as the initial formation of cuprite in \n\nconcordance with the medium interface and its subsequent conversion into other \n\nchemical compounds according to the surrounding environment. The significant \n\nchloride contents and products (CuCl, AgCl, Cu2Cl(OH)3) may indicate a marine rich \n\nenvironment, compatibly with the coastal location of Portugal.  \n\nChlorides usually induce an autocatalytic copper corrosion. This fact may explain \n\nthat 275 and 280 coins were the most damaged ones. This fact is proven by all the micro \n\ndata collected. Finally is important to notice that other corrosion products should be \n\npresent on the surface of the coins. However XRD is capable to detect only crystalline \n\ncompounds. As consequence, other amorphous compounds are probably present as \n\npatina constituents, namely sulphates, phosphates, or others. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPART II \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT OF NANOMATERIALS FOR \n\nCULTURAL HERITAGE CONSERVATION \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n7 9  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n6 EXPERIMENTAL PART \n\nThe experimental part on the development of nanomaterials for cultural heritage \n\nconservation consists on the syntheses and their characterization descriptions.  \n\n6.1 Synthesis of calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide \n\nnanoparticles  \n\n6.1.1 Material and Reactants \n\nFor the experimental process all the glassware was previously decontaminated \n\nwith a 1 mol.dm\n-3\n\n hydrochloric acid solution. The washing solution was made from HCl \n\nCarlo Erba Reagent 37% (w/w). The precipitates were prepared with Type I water \n\nobtained with a Milli-Q Elix 3 water purification system (R=5 to 15 M?.cm) (Merc\n \n\nMilipore). Ethanol (absolute) (Analar Normapur), CaO (Riedel-de Haen; \n\nassay 96-100.0%) and DA (Fluka\n \nAnalytical; assay > 99%) were used. The carbon \n\ndioxide was obtained from a CO2 welding gas cylinder model: 1480-10 (950 cc volume, \n\ntare 1120 g and 390 g of maximum content).  \n\n6.1.2 Procedure \n\nIn order to prepare the calcium carbonate nanoparticles the route proposed by \n\nChen et al. [68] was followed.  \n\nThe process starts with the calcium hydroxide suspension preparation. It was done \n\ndispersing, approximately 2.356 g of CaO into 50 cm\n3 \n\nof deionised water, at 80\no\nC \n\n(constant temperature) and kept overnight for ageing. A 0.1 mol.dm\n-3\n\n ethanolic solution \n\nof dodecanoic acid (etanhol:DA) was prepared. Solution concentration was maintained \n\nconstant varying only the volume added to the suspension. 0.5%, 1.5%, 2.0% and \n\n5.0% (w/w)\n9\n suspensions were prepared. Annexe IV presents the criteria used in the \n\nsuspensions choice (Figure A.IV.1) and a detailed description on the amounts of \n\nCaO (g) and ethanol:DA (dm\n3\n) used (Table A.IV.1). In order to simplify the text \n\nnotation henceforth representative of the different dosages of the suspensions will \n\nx% DA (x = 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0 or 5.0). The mixture was stirred, at room temperature, and \n\nunder magnetic starring for 2 hours. Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles were collected by separating \n\n                                                 \n\n9\n 2.0% (weight DA/weight CaCO3).  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 0  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\nthe suspension, at this point, in two parts. Approximately half of the suspension was \n\ncollected and kept until wash and dry.  \n\nA continuous flow rate of CO2 was carried into the remaining suspension with pH \n\ncontrol (pH 7 units) and the CaCO3 suspensions were collected. The white powders \n\nwere separated from the mother liquid by vacuum filtrations and were washed with \n\ndeionised water and ethanol, several times.  \n\nAll the solids were dry in vacuum oven, at 60\no\nC, for 24 h.  \n\n6.2 Characterization of calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide \n\nnanoparticles  \n\nIn order to study the nanoparticles\u00b4 stability; chemical nature; morphology and \n\ncrystalline phase, their shape and size (including the surface characteristics and surface \n\nmodifications) several techniques were used, namely visual dispersion analysis and \n\nturbidimetry; Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR); X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), respectively.  \n\n6.2.1 Nanoparticles dispersions analysis  \n\nSeveral dispersions, using proportional amounts of CaCO3 (~0.027 g) and \n\nCa(OH)2 (~0.020 g) synthesized powders were made (Annexe IV (Table A.IV.2)). The \n\ndispersions were prepared in cyclohexane obtained from PA Panreac (assay > 99.5.0%) \n\nto a 20 cm\n3\n total volume glass flask. The dispersions were sonicated in an ultrasound \n\nbath (Elma S 30H from Elmasonic) in various cycles of 10 minutes each. The number \n\nof cycles is dependent on the experience. In order to analyze the nanoparticles stability \n\nonly the dispersions with the same number of cycles were compared.  \n\nBased on the obtained results was decided that the highest point of interest were \n\nthe 0.0% and 5.0% DA CaCO3 nanoparticles. For this reason a few more dispersions \n\nwere made for the 5.0% functionalization, in order to compare all the dispersions and \n\ntheir stabilization capability varying the non-polar solvent, nonane (Sigma Aldrich), \n\nand/or introducing, on both dispersions (cyclohexane and nonane), 3 drops of 1-butanol \n\n(Fluka Chemika; assay > 98.0.0%) to analyze the changes that this solvent may, or may \n\nnot, induce (Table A.IV.3 in Annexe IV).  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 1  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n6.2.2 Turbidimetry \n\nTurbidimetry was used in order to study the particles\u00b4 stability on the cyclohexane \n\ndispersions. The equipment used was a Cary100 Bio, UV-Visible spectrophotometer, \n\nfrom Agilent Technologies, controlled by a Cary WinUV Kinetics software. The \n\nmeasuring conditions were set as follows: wavelength fixed on 500 nm and a \n\ntime-cycle\u00b4 analysis depending on the observed stability on the dispersion.  \n\n6.2.3 Attenuated Total Reflectance  \n\nTo study the chemical nature of the samples was used Attenuated Total \n\nReflectance (ATR) technique. These measurements were performed with an Nexus 870 \n\nFTIR ESP spectrometer with a golden gate (Thermo Nicolet) and a Graseby diamond \n\nATR accessory (Specac), coupled with OMNIC software. CaCO3 functionalized \n\npowders with 0.0% DA and 5.0% DA spectrums were recorded at a constant ambient \n\ntemperature with a spectral resolution of 2 cm\n?1\n\n (?: 400-650 cm\n-1\n\n).  \n\n6.2.4 X-ray Diffraction  \n\nThe powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advanced \n\ndiffractometer coupled with a DIFFRAC-EVA commander software. The sample \n\nanalyses were made on the 0.0% and 5.0% DA functionalized CaCO3 powders, using \n\nCu-K? radiation, applying a tension of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The 0.02\u00b0 steps in \n\nthe    range from 5\u00b0 to 80\u00b0 were selected to analyse the crystal structure. Structural \n\ncharacterization of the samples was based on the # PDF-2-2003 database, on \n\nJCPDS/ICCD data and according to literature [66, 75, 103].  \n\n6.2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy  \n\nFinally for the nanoparticles\u00b4 morphology characterization (shape and size) was \n\nused a Gemini FE-SEM for nano-scale analytics (Sigma Zeiss) coupled with Smart \n\nSEM software. Instrument setting was optimised for each single analysis looking for \n\n\u201ccompromise\u201d conditions ensuring the best analysis quality by the detectors. The only \n\nfixed value was the extra high voltage set at 5.0 kV.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n8 3  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n7 RESULTS PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION \n\nIn this chapter a full presentation and discussion of the obtained results both \n\nglobal and at the various stages of the experimental procedure is presented.  \n\n7.1 Nanoparticles\u00b4 visual dispersions analysis  \n\nSeveral CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 dispersions were prepared in non-polar solvents, \n\nnamely cyclohexane and nonane. Theoretically they must be stable for a period of 18 h \n\nto 24 h but in practice this point was not achieved.  \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1 \u2013 CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles dispersions in cyclohexane from 0.0% to 5.0% DA after 6 \n\nultrasound cycles, 10 min each.  \n\nFigure 7.1 presents the results for the 0.0% DA to 5.0% DA CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 \n\ndispersions in cyclohexane after 6 ultrasound cycles of 10 min each and settling for \n\n30 min.  \n\nAfter settling for 24 h it could be seen that, for the 0.5% and 1.5% DA dispersions \n\nany or just a little amount of powder was suspended into the dispersion. Here the \n\ncyclohexane phase remained transparent and the powder was (almost) completed settled \n\ndown. For the 5.0% DA dispersions the suspended amount of powder was superior and \n\nsome flocculation processes were observed.  \n\n7.1.1 Number of ultrasonic cycles dependence  \n\nDuring this work the influence of the number of ultrasonic cycles on the CaCO3 \n\nand Ca(OH)2 dispersions were studied.  \n\nAfter vary the number of cycles but maintaining the period of it, it was concluded \n\nthat more cycles improve the nanoparticles dispersion.  \n\nCaCO3\n\n0.0%        0.5%   1.5%     2.0%   5.0% \n\nCa(OH)2\n\n0.0%         0.5%       1.5%        2.0%      5.0% \n\n\n\n \n\n8 4  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n7.1.2 Other dispersions (nonane and 1-butanol influence)  \n\nVisually comparing the stabilizing effect of the different solvents (cyclohexane; \n\nnonane; cyclohexane+1-butanol and nonane+1-butanol) on the CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 \n\ndispersions it could be concluded that, after the 3 first ultrasocinc cycles the most stable \n\ndispersion was the one with nonane+1-butanol. However, increasing the number of \n\ncycles it made clear that the best dispersion was the one composed only by cyclohexane. \n\nAnother interesting conclusion was that 1-butanol increased the dispersion speed \n\nhowever it did not make teh dispersions more stable.  \n\nMaybe any other solvent or mixture of solvents can produce more stable solutions \n\nhowever, based on the visual stability tests, cyclohexane is the best tested organic \n\nnon-polar solvent for the obtained CaCO3 nanoparticles.  \n\n7.1.3 Nanoparticles dispersions conclusions  \n\nIt could be concluded that the stabilization time of each dispersion was \n\nincompatible with the proposed end because it was too short in time. Thus, at this point \n\nand based only on their visual analysis, theoretically, these dispersions could not be \n\nused advantageously and with positive results for paper conservation.  \n\n7.2 Turbidimetry  \n\nDepending on the particles\u00b4 visual dispersions stability different time-cycle\u00b4 \n\nanalyses were used on turbidimetry tests (Table 7.1). \n\nTable 7.1 \u2013 Time of analyses for the various cyclohexane dispersions of CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2. \n\n% (w/w) \nTime/min \n\nCaCO3 Ca(OH)2 \n\n0.0 60 60 \n0.5 60 60 \n1.5 120 120 \n2.0 120 116.4 \n5.0 102 120 \n\n \n\nGraphically and based on the obtained results it was found that no significant \n\nchanges in the dispersions\u00b4 stability occur from 60 min on. Therefore, are now \n\npresented the stacked graphs with a maximum time limit of 60 min.

Apart from this, it can be concluded that higher amounts of \n\nacid made the settling time slower.

The only exception is for the 0.5% DA sample which takes \n\nmore time until reaches absorbance\u00b4 stabilization point than the immediately after \n\ncontent (2.0%); however the difference is not significant.  \n\nThese results made clear that Ca(OH)2 systems were more stable than the CaCO3 \n\ndispersions. However it does not mean that they are perfect systems because neither one \n\nof them was enough stable for the proposed end.  \n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\nA\nb\n\nso\nr\nv\n\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n/u\n\n.a\n.\n\nTime/min\n\nCa(OH)2\n5.0%DA\n\n2.0%DA\n\n1.5%DA\n\n0.5%DA\n\n0.0%DA\n\n\n\n \n\n8 7  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n7.2.3 Turbidimetry conclusions  \n\nGenerally and schematically it could be concluded, for both carbonate/hydroxide \n\nsystems, that:  \n\n \n\nTurbidimetry results verified what the visual analysis on the dispersions gave idea \n\nabout. Neither CaCO3 nor Ca(OH)2 dispersions, regardless the dodecanoic acid \n\nfunctionalization percentage, were stable enough to the proposed goal.  \n\n \n\nFrom this point on the analyses were made only for the calcium carbonate \n\npowders functionalized with 0.0% and 5.0% DA.

On 5.0% DA sample both DA and its respective carboxylic acid salt peaks were \n\nidentified allowing to confirm its presence on the final compound.  \n\n7.4 X-ray Diffraction  \n\nFigure 7.5 presents the stacked X-ray diffraction patterns obtained for the 0.0% \n\nand 5.0% DA CaCO3 powders. Tables A.V.1 and A.V.2 on Annexe A.V.2 present the \n\nindividual peak identification according to # PDF-2-2003 database, JCPDS/ICCD: \n\n5-586 (CaCO3, calcite); 41-1475 (CaCO3, aragonite) and literature [66, 75, 103].  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 9  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.5 \u2013 Stacked XRD patterns obtained for CaCO3 0.0% (a) and 0.5% DA (b) powders. Principal \n\npeak identification. Legend: C-calcite; A-aragonite; V-vaterite; and CL-calcium laurate.  \n\nIt could be concluded that calcite (rhombohedral symmetry) and aragonite \n\n(orthorhombic crystal system) were presented on the CaCO3 with 0.0% DA synthesized \n\npowder.  \n\nIn turn the X-ray powder diffractogram collected on CaCO3 sample with \n\n5.0% DA showed the presence of calcite, vaterite (hexagonal symmetry) and aragonite, \n\nthree possible structures for this compound. Moreover, one of the most important peaks \n\non this pattern was    = 7,423\no\n. According to Sarkar et al. [66, 75] it corresponds to the \n\ncalcium laurate structure which proved the crystalline salt (Ca(C12H23O2)2) presence. \n\nThis fact was also observed on the ATR spectrum (Figure 7.4 (a)) and by the sharp \n\nmorphology obtained on the SEM images (this topic will be discussed on the following \n\nchapter).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n/a\n\n.u\n.\n\n2?/o\n\n(b) 5.0%DA \n\n(a) 0.0%DA \n\nC\n\nC\nC C C C\n\nCV A V\nC\n\nCA\n\nCL\n\nAVCL\n\n\n\n \n\n9 0  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n7.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy  \n\nOn Figure 7.6 the SEM images collected on the calcium carbonate particles \n\nfunctionalized with 0.0% and 5.0% of dodecanoic acid, respectively, can be seen.  \n\n \n\nFigure 7.6 \u2013 SEM images on CaCO3 with 0.0% (a, b, c) and 5.0% (d, e, f) DA powders.  \n\nBased on these images it could be concluded that for the 0.0% DA sample \n\n(Figure 7.6 (a, b and c)) something-like polymorphous clusters were present. These \n\nobjects, according to the previous results, should be composed by a combination of \n\ncalcite and aragonite and/or polymorphs materials. However, these items are bigger than \n\nnano-sized particles, being non-homogeneous even on their grain size.  \n\nFor the 5.0% DA CaCO3 powder (Figure 7.6 (d, e and f)) it could be seen that an \n\nevident morphology change occurred due the dodecanoic acid presence.

In this case, population \n\nwas well distributed and with a small presence of, probably, nanoparticles.  \n\nIn general, it could be concluded that there was no significant amount of calcium \n\ncarbonate nanoparticles in the synthesized powders. On both cases (0.0% and 5.0% DA) \n\nsmall populations (in the white circles - Figure 7.6 (a) and (d)) that possibly are \n\nnano-objects were observed. However its amount was not enough to admit that the \n\nsynthesis was well achieved, not leading to the production of enough contents of \n\nnanomaterials. \n\nThe morphology of the crystals ascertained by SEM images together with the \n\ndiffraction patterns obtained by XRD allowed to state that DA has promoted a \n\nmorphologic change from (something-like) calcite and/or aragonite to rosette shaped \n\naragonite particles. Probably these rosette shaped particles were comprised of an \n\naggregation of nano-aragonite rods explained by the aragonite needles tendency to \n\naggregate and form this kind of rosettes structures. A similar morphology of aragonite \n\nhas been reported by Sarkar et al. [66, 75]. Finally, DA complexed with the calcium \n\nions yielding calcium laurate, which acted as a seed agent to nucleate, preferentially, \n\naragonite instead of calcite.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n9 3  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n8 CONCLUSIONS  \n\nFirst of all it is important to note that the obtained results were different from the \n\nones that were expected. In fact it was proved that the followed route was not able, \n\nunder the specific applied conditions, to produce enough nanoparticles capable of \n\nreaching the proposed goal. \n\nResults from the visual analysis dispersions and turbidimetry technique (CaCO3 \n\nand Ca(OH)2 with 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0 and 5.0% of dodecanoic acid dispersed in \n\ncyclohexane) were in concordance. Both results proved the instability, at least not the \n\nnecessary one, of the dispersions. However and based in all the accomplished tests \n\ncyclohexane proved to be the best solvent from the studied set.  \n\nBased on these results and according to other ongoing works in the group, the \n\nfollowing studies were made on 0.0% and 5.0% DA calcium carbonate particles. \n\nAccording to ATR spectra, XRD patterns and SEM images it could be concluded that \n\nthe reaction without any acid content was effective. It could be seen that calcite and \n\naragonite structures were present but the nanoparticles amount was not significant. \n\nAbout the reaction with 5.0% DA the nanoparticles amount was again non-significant \n\nbut the introduction of this organic fatty acid induced enormous morphology and \n\ncrystallography changes on the CaCO3 particles. After the functionalization the powder \n\nshowed the presence of calcite, vaterite, aragonite and the carboxylic acid salt (calcium \n\nlaurate). It was evident the morphologic change to rosette shaped particles.  \n\nMoreover, in both cases, the reduced amount of nano-objects can, probably, \n\njustify the non-stability dispersions.  \n\nChemically the dodecanoic acid changes are very interesting. However this \n\nCaCO3 functionalized powders are not useful for the main goal once the amount of \n\nnanoparticles was so reduce that the dispersed particles would not penetrate deeply \n\ninside the surface (due to their size). Therefore the powders would not be very effective \n\nagainst the internal acidity of the paper. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n9 5  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n9 FUTURE WORK AND SIGNIFICANCE  \n\nPatina evaluation is one of the best ways to do the evaluation on the conservation \n\nstate of antique coins. First of all and taking advantage of the used techniques an \n\nexamination on the coins cross-section by SEM/EDS would be helpful in order to study \n\nthe coin stratification and constitution (patina and bulk). The use of other techniques \n\nsuch as Radio Frequency Glow Discharge (rf-GD-OES) in order to analyze the depth \n\nprofiling (less evasive than cross-section) or Raman spectroscopy for the organic \n\ncompounds, evaluations would be also interesting. However, all of these proposals \n\ninvolve destruction of the matrix under study. A detailed research and study on the ore \n\nprovenance would also be very interesting. It was tried to study the ore origin however \n\ndue the coins antiquity this information would required more time and resources. An \n\ninterdisciplinary approach in order to understand the ore derivation and the consequent \n\nsoil study would be recommendable.  \n\nNanomaterials for art and heritage conservation play an important role in the field \n\nof paper conservation. In fact, they are the future due the enormous interest in protect \n\nand treat the old papers and prevent the new one\u00b4s deterioration. Its operating costs have \n\ngreat potential even for big scale applications. It would be very interesting to see the \n\nmade dispersions application and their characterization results, according to the exposed \n\nmethodology. It would be the most effective form to confirm all the obtained and \n\nexposed results. As future work it is advisable the improvement of the proposed \n\nsynthesis. Ameliorate parameters such as: make sure that the environment inside the \n\nsynthesis flask is rich in carbon dioxide; a high and effective control on the reactants \n\nconcentrations, maybe varying its proportions; as well as, a greater temperature control \n\nduring the reactions, since this is a key point in the nanoparticles\u00b4 formation. This \n\nwould help obtaining a more accurate model in order to create reduced particles size. It \n\nwould also be beneficial experiment other non-polar organic solvents for the \n\ndispersions. Obtaining a better synthesis and understanding its dispersions, especially \n\nrelatively on particle size, would further improve the results.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n9 7  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n10 BIBLIOGRAPHY AND WEBGRAPHY \n\n[1] Vaz, J.F.

In copper alloys this process results in a loss of certain of the included elements \n\nthrough oxidation, particularly arsenic and antimony [21].  \n\n \n\n6.\n Sizing \u2013 introduction of a substance to paper in order to change its surface \n\nproperties, e.g. to improve strength or reduce absorbency of water. Generally \n\n\u201cpapermaker\u2019s alum\u201d (or alum-rosin), an acidic hydrated aluminium sulphate \n\n(Al2(SO4)3.xH2O, where x=16 or 18) was added to early paper made from wood pulp, to \n\nharden and to help the gelatine sizing, making the paper somewhat water resistant so \n\nthat inks did not \u201crun\u201d or spread uncontrollably. Synthetic sizing agents as alkyl ketene \n\ndimer used industrially to improve hydrophobicity in paper and alkenyl succinic \n\nanhydride as a wet strength additive in paper are nowadays used. \n\n \n\n7.\n Fenton mechanism \u2013 consists on the oxidation of an organic substrate by \n\niron (II) and hydrogen peroxide. On this case the stability of the iron-gall ink complex is \n\ngoverned by the ratio between Fe (II) ions and tanning agent. The free Fe\n2+\n\n ions present \n\nin the system act in redox reactions, usually catalyzing cellulose oxidation through a \n\nfree radical mechanism, leading to the this mechanism. This decomposition can be \n\nstopped by introducing a chelating agent to complexing the Fe (II) in the ink [60-64].  \n\n \n\n\n\nAnnexe II  \n\nSTATISTICS FOR ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY AND METHOD \n\nEVALUATION  \n\nFor a set of n values where    is the individual value of x the following parameters \n\ncan be defined.  \n\nA.II.1  Mean  \n\nThe mean value (  ) is the arithmetic average of all measurements results. If the \n\nsample is randomly taken then the average is the best estimate of the population mean. \n\nThe mean value is given by Equation A.II.1 [100]:  \n\n   \n \n\n \n     \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n \n\nEquation A.II.1 \n\nA.II.2 Standard deviation, standard deviation of the mean and \n\nrelative standard deviation \n\nStandard deviation (SD) (       is the positive square root of the variance for \n\n(n-1) degrees of freedom. This is a useful concept to express the confidence of \n\nanalytical instrumental response and it is given by Equation A.II.2 [100]:  \n\n       \n \n\n   \n        \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\nEquation A.II.2 \n\nStandard deviation of the mean          is an estimate of the standard deviation of \n\nthe mean values that would arise if repeated samples were taken from the population \n\n(Equation A.II.3). Its value is smaller than the         [100, 101]. \n\n       \n     \n\n  \n \n\n \nEquation A.II.3 \n\nThe relative standard deviation or coefficient of variation (RSD or CV) is a \n\nmeasure of the spread of data in comparison to the data mean. It is obtained through the \n\nratio between the sample standard deviation and its mean (Equation A.II.4) [100, 101]:  \n\n\n\n \n\nA - v  |  P a g e  \n\n \n\n    \n     \n\n  \n                 \n\n         \n\n  \n  Equation A.II.4 \n\nThis parameter quantifies the incidence of random errors in the analytical result. \n\nThe smaller the RSD better reproducibility of the method, since the spread of results \n\naround the mean value is lower [101].  \n\nA.II.3 Uncertainty of the Limit of Detection  \n\nIn order to calculate the combined standard uncertainty relative to the LOD value \n\nEquations A.II.5 and A.II.6 were follow [100, 102]:  \n\n    \n      \n\n  \n  Equation 4.1 \n\n         \n   \n  \n\n    \n   \n  \n\n    \n   \n  \n\n          Equation A.II.5 \n\n                 Equation A.II.6 \n\nwhere u(LOD), u(ci), u(Nb) and u(Np) are the relative standard uncertainties from LOD, \n\nthe concentration of the element i, and the counting rates for the background and for the \n\npeak, respectively. U(LOD) is the combined standard uncertainty for the LOD value and  \n\nk is the coverage factor, in this case, k = 2,for a confidence level of, approximately, \n\n95%. \n \n\nA.II.4 Method precision  \n\nThe estimation of precision (uncertainty resulting from random errors) is \n\nperformed by calculating the standard deviation, RSD or the variance of the sample [87, \n\n101]. Precision describes the method reproducibility. Greater precision imply higher \n\nequipment reproducibility [101].
