Eighteen 1.0m\n3\n cages were placed into a 2000m\n\n2\n pond,\n\n \ntwo \n\nmeters deep with a 5% water exchange.

However, the larger the production unit \n\nthe more complex and onerous feed management \n\nbecomes, due to the greater number of qualified \n\npeople needed to detect changes in fish behavior \n\nand supply adequate ration.  \n\n \n\n\n\nProductive performance of Nile Tilapia... \n\nArq. Bras. Med. Vet. Zootec., v.64, n.1, p.192-197, 2012 193 \n\nThe automatic fish feeders found on the market \n\nare manufactured with a device for launching the \n\nfood long distances in the pond. These devices \n\nincrease the cost of feeding and their use is too \n\nexpensive for cages, where a feeder is necessary \n\nfor each unit. However, there is an automatic \n\nfeeder proposed by Agostinho et al. (2004) that \n\nis ideal for cages and costs four to five times less \n\nthan the dispensers found in the market. This \n\nequipment consists of a container dimensioned \n\naccording to the size of the cage, which releases \n\nthe food in programmed periods and quantities. \n\n \n\nThe correct feed management is essential for \n\nimproving fish growth and homogeny without \n\ncompromising health, since food in excess builds \n\nmetabolic alterations, in addition to water quality \n\ndeterioration. For filter fish species that naturally \n\nfeed at a high frequency, small ratio portions \n\nwith a greater daily frequency is recommended \n\n(Meer et al., 1997). Yao et al. (1994), analyzing \n\nthe effects of feeding frequency in Plecoglossus \n\naltivelis (ayu), reported that the fish fed four \n\ntimes a day presented a lower triglyceride level \n\nthan those fed only twice daily.  \n\n \n\nNutrient assimilation by tilapia is affected by the \n\ninteraction between diet protein level or free \n\namino acids and the frequency in which the \n\nanimals are fed. The free amino acids are \n\nabsorbed faster than the amino acids present in \n\nthe protein that needs intestinal proteases to \n\nconvert them into di or tripeptides to be absorbed \n\nby enterocytes. Only after this absorption are \n\nthey broken into amino acids by specific di or \n\ntripeptidases, for subsequent transport to the liver \n\nand to the target tissues.  This process is slow \n\nand most of the free amino acids upon arrival at \n\nthe target tissues are not used for protein \n\nsynthesis anymore. The increase in feeding \n\nfrequency efficiently supplies free amino acids \n\nwhile there are still amino acids from the prior \n\nfeeding of protein diet (Lara, 2006). \n\n \n\nThree systems are normally used to supply ration \n\nin tilapia farming and fishes in general:  manual \n\nfeeding, by demand and automatic. Automatic \n\nfeeding ? frequency of 12 times per day ? for \n\nNile tilapias this has presented superior results \n\ncompared to other methods (Novato, 2000). \n\nSimilar results were found for Dicentrarchus \n\nlabrax (Azzaydi et al., 2000).  \n\n \n\nTrials with tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus), \n\nrainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), channel \n\ncatfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and African catfish \n\n(Clarias gariepinus) showed that these species \n\nalso feed at night. However, this practice cannot \n\nbe done in commercial fish farming, due to the \n\nhigh cost of manual labor. The use of the \n\nautomatic feeder would permit an increase in \n\nfeeding frequency and food supply at night. \n\n \n\nThe feeding activity of tilapias is strongly linked \n\nto photoperiod, presenting greater activity at \n\ndawn and sunset (Toguyeni et al., 1997). Baras \n\net al. (1995), studying juvenile of Nile Tilapia \n\nobtained a higher growth rate and better feed \n\nconversion for the nocturnal period than for fish \n\nfed during the day. \n\n \n\nSome authors observed that some species such as \n\nrainbow trout, fed with auto-feeders, show feed \n\npeaks at dawn and at nightfall (Boujard and \n\nLeatherland, 1992; Shima et al., 2003). \n\nYamamoto et al. (2002) observed 7 to 9% \n\nactivity in the first hours of night with demand \n\nfeeders for this same species and, when \n\nsubmitted to automatic feeding, the fish ingested \n\na superior quantity of food compared to self-\n\nfeeding. The ingestion peaks for this species are \n\nfrom 5-6 A.M. and  6-7 P.M. (Valente et al., \n\n2001). \n\n \n\nThe efficiency of nocturnal feeding for \n\nfingerlings of African catfish was reported by \n\nHossain et al. (2001). When fed at night (four \n\ntimes per night) with automatic feeders, they \n\nshow better food conversion rate than those fed \n\nonly during the day or during the day and at \n\nnight. Thus, the present study had the objective \n\nof evaluating the performance of tilapia raised in \n\ncages, provided with automatic feeder, fed in \n\ndifferent frequencies and periods. \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n \n\nThe experiment was carried out during autumn \n\nand winter in Brazil, from March, 17\nth\n\n to July, \n\n21\nst\n (126 days). Eighteen 1.0m\u00b3 cages arranged in \n\nline were placed in a 2000m\n2\n pond\n\n \ntwo meters \n\ndeep with water renovation of 5 to 10%. The \n\ntilapias were acquired from a commercial fish \n\nfarm. The initial density was 170 fishes/m\u00b3 with \n\ninitial weight of 16.0\u00b14.9 grams. The daily feed \n\nration was based on live weight (from 7% initial \n\nto 2% at the end). The quantity of food was \n\n\n\nSousa et al. \n\n194  Arq. Bras. Med. Vet. Zootec., v.64, n.1, p.192-197, 2012 \n\nadjusted every 21 days, when the size and weight \n\nmeasurements were taken. The commercial \n\nrations offered, according to the manufacturer, \n\nwere prepared with 32% protein, 10% moisture, \n\n3% fat, 5% fiber, 8% mineral, 1.8% calcium and \n\n0.8% phosphorus. The food offering for each \n\ntreatment is shown in Table 1. \n\n \n\nTable 1. Scheme of food offering by automatic \n\nfeeder \n\nPeriod* Frequency  \n\nDay  \n\nonce every two hours Night \n\nDay and night \n\nNight  \n\nonce per hour Day  \n\nDay and night \n(*) Day = from 6am to 6pm; Night = from 6pm to \n\n6am.  \n\n \n\nIn order to reach the feeding frequency  \n\nproposed, an automatic feeder was installed in \n\neach cage. The automatic feeder consists of a \n\nconic reservoir manufactured with impermeable \n\nmaterial (glass fiber) containing an \n\nelectromechanical mechanism that releases ration \n\nin pre-established intervals with a timer. The \n\nfeed is dispensed into the interior of cages. Each \n\nautomatic feeder holds four kilograms of food \n\nsupplied twice a week.  \n\n \n\nFish biomass was estimated in a 21-day interval \n\nin order to accurate the food rate to be offered. \n\nBiometry consisted of 20-fish weight samples \n\nfrom each experimental unit; this fairly high \n\nsignificance level was used to reduce the number \n\nof stressed fishes related to the frequent \n\nsamplings.  \n\n \n\nThe sampling began with the removal of ration \n\nfrom the automatic feeders to calculate the food \n\nintake during 21 days. The fish from the samples \n\nwere weighed individually on an Instrutherm-\n\nbrand digital balance with 0.1g precision, and \n\nafter weighing the tilapias were returned to their \n\nrespective cages. The mean weight of each \n\ntreatment was calculated to adjust the feed rate \n\noffered based on commercial tables for fish \n\nfarmers reducing rate for heavier fishes when \n\ntemperature is lower than 19\no\nC (May 20\n\nth\n to July \n\n21\nst\n) , Based on that, feed rate varied from 7.0% \n\nat the beginning to 2.0% at the end of the \n\nexperiment. Animals were weighed six times \n\nduring the experiment and all fish were weighed \n\nat the end of the period. \n\n \n\nDuring the experiment, limnological variables \n\nwere determined [transparency (Secchi disc); pH \n\n(Oakton peagometer), temperature and dissolved \n\noxygen DO (YSI 55)]. They were monitored \n\ndaily in the morning, at three distinct points in \n\nthe pond, according to the position of the in \n\nflowing water. In the first 21 days the pond was \n\nsupplied with spring water, due to low initial \n\noutflow, providing a volume renovation rate of \n\nonly 5%. After the first sampling, a new source \n\nof spring water was exploited to supply the pond, \n\nelevating the daily flow to 10%.  \n\n \n\nThe experiment was designed in a 2x3 factorial \n\narrangement, in a total of six treatments with \n\nthree replications. Data was compared using \n\nANOVA with a model that considers the effect \n\nof feeding frequency, feeding period and the \n\ninteraction between feeding frequency and \n\nfeeding period. Duncan test at 5% probability \n\nlevel was used to compare the means. \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\n \n\nThe water temperature decreased from the \n\nbeginning to the end of the experiment. Irregular \n\nvariation in oxygen level in each pond was \n\nobserved. Water transparency slightly decreased \n\nduring the experimental progress and pH values \n\ndemonstrated little variation from the beginning \n\nto the end of the experiment, assuming a \n\ntendency to alkalinity (Table 2). \n\n \n\nThe tilapias raised in cages fed at different \n\nfrequencies and periods showed statistical \n\ndifference (P<0.05) in performance evaluation. \n\nTable 3 presents final weights and feed \n\nconversion rates for the interaction between \n\nfrequencies and periods. Despite the observation \n\nof an apparent relative difference in values \n\nbetween treatments, the feed conversion rates did \n\nnot present statistical difference; the F value was \n\ntoo high for this variable in ANOVA test. During \n\nthe first week of the experiment there was a 5% \n\nloss of juveniles, but this mortality was probably \n\ndue to transportation stress, fish adaptation to the \n\ncages and difference in water quality, since the \n\nsurvival for the remaining period was 100%. \n \n\n \n\n\n\nProductive performance of Nile Tilapia... \n\nArq.

According to Boyd and Tucker (1998) \n\nlarge periodic fluctuations in dissolved oxygen \n\nmay reduce fish performance.  \n\n \n\nThe pH values showed little variation from the \n\nbeginning to the end of the experiment, assuming \n\na tendency toward alkalinity near to 7.8 at the \n\nbeginning of the experiment and 8.1 at its \n\nconclusion. Water transparency decreased \n\nslightly during the course of the experiment, with \n\nan average of 45.0cm. This reduction may have \n\noccurred due to phytoplankton blooming \n\n(Sipa\u00faba-Tavares, 1995).  \n\n \n\nThe weight gain results can be promising since \n\nthe experiment was conducted in autumn and \n\nwinter. The mean temperature shown in Table 2 \n\nwas below the ideal temperature for this species \n\nthat, according to Kubtiza (2000), can range \n\nbetween 27 and 32\u00baC. \n\n \n\nIt should be emphasized that the feed conversion \n\nrate for low feeding frequency (once every two \n\nhours) was 1.40 and for high feeding frequency \n\n(once per hour) was 1.04 (Table 3), which can \n\nresult in saving 360kg of food for each ton of \n\nfish produced, increasing the economic \n\nsustenance for tilapia culture, additionally \n\nsuggesting less environmental pollution. \n\n \n\nIn the present study there was interaction \n\nbetween feeding frequency and period. For the \n\nfeeding frequency of once per hour and once \n\nevery two hours there was no significant \n\ndifference on final weight of tilapias fed during \n\nthe day period and the ones fed during day and \n\nnight (Table 3). For the once per hour feeding \n\nfrequency the performance of tilapias fed during \n\nthe day-night period was higher than tilapias fed \n\nonly at night (P<0.05). For the once every two \n\nhours feeding frequency, the best performance \n\nwas for tilapias fed during the day. The lower \n\nlevel of dissolved oxygen in water at night may \n\nhave contributed to the inversion of better \n\nproductive performances related to feeding \n\nfrequency, since during feeding tilapias double \n\ntheir oxygen consumption.  \n\n \n\nCorrelated to feeding periods, the only \n\nsignificant difference for feeding frequency \n\noccurred in the day/night period, in which the \n\nonce per hour frequency was superior to that of \n\nonce every two hours for final weight (P<0.05). \n\nThis tendency matches the results obtained by \n\n\n\nSousa et al. \n\n196  Arq. Bras. Med. Vet. Zootec., v.64, n.1, p.192-197, 2012 \n\nseveral authors for different species (Tung and \n\nShiau, 1991; Koskela et al., 1997; Novato, 2000; \n\nPadua et al., 2001). \n\n \n\nOne common practice in commercial tilapia \n\nfarming is a periodic classification to reduce the \n\nlack of uniformity among the fish in cages, \n\nwhich causes stress that generally results in \n\nmortality after handling. The results obtained \n\nduring this experiment demonstrated greater \n\nuniformity in the treatment with a higher feeding \n\nfrequency, confirming the results obtained by \n\nKoskela et al. (1997) for the species Coreogonus \n\nlavaretus and by Wang et al. (1998) for a hybrid \n\nsunfish. \n\n \n\nThe data presented indicate that the increase in \n\nfeeding frequency associated with daytime or \n\nday/night time feeding improved the \n\nperformance of Nile Tilapia in cages, suggesting \n\nthat a greater number of feeding permits better \n\nexploitation of feed and availability of dissolved \n\noxygen. Additional studies should be conducted \n\nto better define feeding frequencies and periods \n\nfor other species growth in national and global \n\naquiculture, at the same time contributing for the \n\nsustenance of the activity.  \n\n \n\nWith the use of automatic feeders it was possible \n\nto supply the food in small portions improving \n\nthe feed exploitation and reducing waste and \n\ncompetition for food.  According to Tsadik and \n\nKutty (1987), food consumption and absorption \n\nby tilapias and their growth are influenced by the \n\nquantity of oxygen dissolved in the water.  \n\n \n\nWhen feed is offered in higher frequencies the \n\ndaily demand for oxygen is lessened. \n\nFurthermore, species such as tilapia, which \n\npossess a long digestive tract and omnivorous \n\nfeeding habits, can take better advantage of the \n\nfood nutrients when the feeding frequency is \n\nhigher at the right time of the day, resulting in \n\nincreased weight gain. Thus, a greater parceling \n\nof daily ration quantity is recommended for feed \n\nmanagement for tilapias fed during the day or \n\nday/night. \n\n \n\nThe fish performance from the nocturnal feeding \n\nperiod treatment, done with an automatic feeder, \n\nwas significantly less than the other treatment \n\nperformance (P<0.05), in contrast to the data \n\nobtained by Baras et al. (1995) with juvenile of \n\nNile Tilapia and by Kerduchuen and Legendre \n\n(1991), for Heterobranchus longifilis. However, \n\nthe performance of tilapias fed only at night \n\npresented results which suggested that tilapias \n\nalso feed at night.  This feeding habit was also \n\nobserved for the rainbow trout by diverse authors \n\n(Boujard and Leatherland, 1992; Valente et al., \n\n2001; Shima et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., \n\n2002). \n\n \n\nIn the present study it can be observed that \n\ntilapias presented good exploitation of the food \n\nin all periods evaluated, with better results for \n\nhigh frequencies during day and night periods. \n\nNevertheless, nocturnal feeding is not practiced \n\ncurrently in Brazil due to lack of studies, \n\ninformation and cost of manual labor.  \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe increase in feeding frequency improves the \n\nperformance of Nile tilapia in cages and the \n\ngreater number of feedings allows better food \n\nexploitation by the fish. It is suggested that \n\nduring autumn and winter, to produce tilapia in \n\nthe phases from 16.0 to 250.0g, ration should be \n\nsupplied only during the day, turning off the \n\nfeeders at night.  \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nAGOSTINHO, C.A.; LIMA, S.L.; FORTES, J.V. \n\net al.
