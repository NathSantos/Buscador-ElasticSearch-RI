Contudo, a informa\u00e7\u00e3o\nacerca da ecologia e biologia das esp\u00e9cies de gorg\u00f3nias nas zonas\ntemperadas do NE Atl\u00e2ntico \u00e9 manifestamente escassa, especialmente\ntendo em considera\u00e7\u00e3o as actuais perturba\u00e7\u00f5es globais, regionais e\nlocais. Nos fundos rochosos da costa algarvia at\u00e9 aos 30 m, verificou-\nse que v\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies de gorg\u00f3nias s\u00e3o abundantes e frequentes,\nnomeadamente Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa,\nLeptogorgia lusitanica e Leptogorgia sarmentosa. As popula\u00e7\u00f5es de\ngorg\u00f3nias s\u00e3o co-dominadas por diferentes esp\u00e9cies que apresentaram\nelevados \u00edndices de associa\u00e7\u00e3o, indicando reduzidos n\u00edveis de competi\u00e7\u00e3o\nentre elas. Em todo o caso, a estrutura dos povoamentos diferiu\ncom as condi\u00e7\u00f5es locais. Todas as esp\u00e9cies evidenciaram padr\u00f5es\nde distribui\u00e7\u00e3o semelhantes ao longo do gradiente de profundidade,\ni.e. a abund\u00e2ncia aumenta significamente com a profundidade ap\u00f3s\nos 15 m. A profundidades mais baixas (at\u00e9 aos 15 m), a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o\ndas gorg\u00f3nias parece ser condicionada por factores abi\u00f3ticos e pela\ncompeti\u00e7\u00e3o com algas. Com efeito, os padr\u00f5es de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial\ndas esp\u00e9cies de gorg\u00f3nias na costa algarvia s\u00e3o determinados pela\ninterac\u00e7\u00e3o de press\u00f5es naturais e antropog\u00e9nicas (ex. pesca). Ainda que\nas col\u00f3nias de maior tamanho n\u00e3o tenham sido restritas a \u00e1reas menos\npescadas, em \u00e1reas mais perturbadas pela pesca, a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos\ntamanhos das col\u00f3nias estava maioritariamente desviada para tamanhos\nmais pequenos. Os efeitos das perturba\u00e7\u00f5es naturais nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es de\ngorg\u00f3nias foram evidenciados pela ocorr\u00eancia de padr\u00f5es demogr\u00e1ficos\ndistintos em \u00e1reas vizinhas sujeitas a n\u00edveis semelhantes de press\u00f5es\nantropog\u00e9nicas. Estes estudos demonstraram, ainda, que os efeitos na\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o de frequ\u00eancias de tamanho das col\u00f3nias s\u00e3o dependentes\ndas esp\u00e9cies de gorg\u00f3nias em causa: Eunicella labiata n\u00e3o parece\nser afectada; Leptogorgia sarmentosa \u00e9 tendencialmente afectada por\npress\u00f5es antropog\u00e9nicas; Eunicella gazella e Leptogorgia lusitanica\naparentam ser afectadas, quer por press\u00f5es naturais, quer por press\u00f5es\nantropog\u00e9nicas. Os efeitos verificados nos padr\u00f5es da distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de\nfrequ\u00eancias de tamanho, particularmente a tend\u00eancia para o desvio\ndestas frequ\u00eancias para tamanhos mais pequenos em \u00e1reas sujeitas\na perturba\u00e7\u00f5es, poder\u00e3o ter consequ\u00eancias para a biodiversidade dos\nfundos sublitorais rochosos na costa algarvia.\n\n\n\n\n\nCom efeito, o presente estudo apoia o paradigma geral de que os corais\ns\u00e3o habitats que suportam comunidades de elevada biodiversidade e\nabund\u00e2ncia. Num dos poucos estudos que examinam a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre\nas gorg\u00f3nias e as suas comunidades de invertebrados epibent\u00f3nicos, foi\nverificado que as gorg\u00f3nias (Eunicella gazella e Leptogorgia lusitanica)\nsustentam comunidades ricas (11 phyla, 181 taxa) e abundantes (7284\nindiv\u00edduos). Estas comunidades s\u00e3o dominadas por anf\u00edpodes, mas\nos poliquetas tiveram um grande contributo para os n\u00edveis elevados de\nbiodiversidade. Verificou-se, igualmente, que o tamanho da col\u00f3nia\ndesempenha um papel fundamental na biodiversidade, na medida em\nque as col\u00f3nias de menor tamanho apresentaram um contributo mais\nbaixo, comparativamente \u00e0s m\u00e9dias e grandes. Ainda que ambas\nas gorg\u00f3nias partilhem a maioria das esp\u00e9cies amostradas, 11 e 18\ntaxa foram exclusivos de Eunicella gazella e Leptogorgia lusitanica,\nrespectivamente (excluindo indiv\u00edduos com presen\u00e7as \u00fanicas). No\nentanto, a maioria destes taxa eram ou pouco abundantes ou pouco\nfrequentes. A excep\u00e7\u00e3o foi a presen\u00e7a de plan\u00e1rias (Turbellaria) de\ncolora\u00e7\u00e3o branca nas col\u00f3nias de Eunicella gazella, provavelmente\nbeneficiando do efeito de camuflagem proporcionado pelos ramos com\na mesma colora\u00e7\u00e3o. Com efeito, a complementaridade entre as\ncomunidades epibent\u00f3nicas associadas a ambas as gorg\u00f3nias diminuiu\nquando usados os dados de presen\u00e7a/aus\u00eancia, sugerindo que os padr\u00f5es\nde biodiversidade s\u00e3o mais afectados pelas altera\u00e7\u00f5es na abund\u00e2ncia\nrelativa das esp\u00e9cies dominantes do que pela composi\u00e7\u00e3o faun\u00edstica.\nAs comunidades de epifauna bent\u00f3nica associadas a estas gorg\u00f3nias\nn\u00e3o s\u00f3 apresentaram valores elevados de ?-diversidade, como de ?-\ndiversidade, resultantes de padr\u00f5es intrincados de variabilidade na sua\ncomposi\u00e7\u00e3o e estrutura. Ainda que o conjunto de esp\u00e9cies dispon\u00edveis\npara coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o seja, na generalidade, o mesmo para ambos os locais,\ncada col\u00f3nia apresenta uma parte deste conjunto. Na sua totalidade,\nas col\u00f3nias de gorg\u00f3nias poder\u00e3o funcionar como uma metacomunidade,\nmas a estrutura das comunidades associadas a cada col\u00f3nia (ex. n\u00famero\ntotal de esp\u00e9cies e abund\u00e2ncia) parecem depender dos atributos da\ncol\u00f3nia, nomeadamente superf\u00edcie dispon\u00edvel para coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o (altura,\nlargura e \u00e1rea), complexidade e heterogeneidade (dimens\u00e3o fractal e\nlacunaridade, respectivamente) e cobertura epibent\u00f3nica \u201ccolonial\u201d (ex.\nfauna colonial e algas macrosc\u00f3picas; CEC). Numa primeira tentativa para\nquantificar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as gorg\u00f3nias e os invertebrados epibent\u00f3nicos\na elas associados (em termos de abund\u00e2ncia e riqueza espec\u00edfica),\nverificou-se que a natureza e a intensidade destas rela\u00e7\u00f5es dependem da\nesp\u00e9cie hospedeira e variam para os grupos taxon\u00f3micos principais. No\nentanto, independentemente do grupo taxon\u00f3mico, a riqueza espec\u00edfica\ne a abund\u00e2ncia est\u00e3o significativamente correlacionadas com a CEC.\nCom efeito, a CEC provavelmente devido a um efeito tr\u00f3fico (aumento da\ndisponibilidade alimentar directo ou indirecto), combinado com a superf\u00edcie\ndispon\u00edvel para coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o (efeito esp\u00e9cies-\u00e1rea) foram as vari\u00e1veis mais\nrelacionadas com os padr\u00f5es de abund\u00e2ncia e riqueza espec\u00edfica.\n\n\n\n\n\nPor outro lado, ainda que a complexidade estrutural seja frequentemente\nindicada como um dos factores respons\u00e1veis pela elevada diversidade e\nabund\u00e2ncia das comunidades bent\u00f3nicas associadas a corais, a dimens\u00e3o\nfractal e a lacunaridade apenas foram relevantes nas comunidades\nassociadas a Leptogorgia lusitanica. A validade do paradigma que\ndefende que a complexidade estrutural promove a biodiversidade poder\u00e1\nser, ent\u00e3o, dependente da escala a que se realizam os estudos. No\ncaso das gorg\u00f3nias, o efeito da complexidade ao n\u00edvel dos agregados\nde gorg\u00f3nias poder\u00e1 ser muito mais relevante do que ao n\u00edvel da col\u00f3nia\nindividual, refor\u00e7ando a import\u00e2ncia da sua conserva\u00e7\u00e3o como um todo,\npor forma a preservar a diversidade de esp\u00e9cies hospedeiras, o seu\ntamanho e estrutura. Actividades antropog\u00e9nicas como a pesca, podem,\nainda, ter efeitos negativos ao n\u00edvel da reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies marinhas.\nAnalogamente ao verificado para os padr\u00f5es de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial\ndas popula\u00e7\u00f5es de gorg\u00f3nias na costa algarvia, a informa\u00e7\u00e3o relativa\n\u00e0 sua reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 igualmente escassa. Os estudos realizados em\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es de Eunicella gazella a 16 m de profundidade, demonstraram\nque o desenvolvimento anual das estruturas reprodutivas \u00e9 altamente\nsincronizado entre os sexos. A raz\u00e3o entre sexos na popula\u00e7\u00e3o foi\nde 1.09 (F:M), encontrando-se perto da paridade. A espermatog\u00e9nese\nestende-se por 6 a 8 meses, enquanto que a oog\u00e9nese \u00e9 mais demorada,\nlevando mais de um ano para que os o\u00f3citos se desenvolvam at\u00e9 estarem\nmaduros. Antes da liberta\u00e7\u00e3o dos g\u00e2metas, foi observada uma elevada\nfecundidade nas f\u00eameas (27.30 \u00b1 13.24 o\u00f3citos p\u00f3lipo?1) e nos machos\n(49.30 \u00b1 31.14 sacos esperm\u00e1ticos p\u00f3lipo?1). Estes valores encontram-se\nentre os mais elevados reportados \u00e0 data para zonas temperadas. A\nliberta\u00e7\u00e3o dos g\u00e2metas (n\u00e3o h\u00e1 evid\u00eancia de desenvolvimento larvar,\nnem \u00e0 superf\u00edcie da col\u00f3nia, nem no seu interior) occorre em Setem-\nbro/Outubro, ap\u00f3s um per\u00edodo de elevada temperatura da \u00e1gua do mar.\nAs f\u00eameas emitem o\u00f3citos maduros de elevadas dimens\u00f5es, retendo,\ntodavia, os o\u00f3citos imaturos que se desenvolvem apenas na \u00e9poca\nseguinte. Ainda que o efeito da pesca nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es de gorg\u00f3nias\nda costa do Algarve seja percept\u00edvel, \u00e0s taxas actuais, o mergulho\nrecreativo n\u00e3o aparenta afectar seriamente estas popula\u00e7\u00f5es. Contudo,\nsendo uma ind\u00fastria em expans\u00e3o e conhecendo-se a prefer\u00eancia de\nmergulhadores por \u00e1reas rochosas naturais ricas em esp\u00e9cies bent\u00f3nicas,\nfuturamente poder\u00e1 vir a afectar estes habitats. A monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de\nmergulhadores na costa algarvia mostrou que a sua maioria (88.6 %)\napresenta comportamentos que podem impactar o habitat, com uma taxa\nm\u00e9dia de contactos de 0.340 \u00b1 0.028 contactos min?1. Esta taxa foi mais\nelevada em mergulhadores com moderada experi\u00eancia e na fase inicial\ndo mergulho (0\u201310 min). Os contactos com as barbatanas e m\u00e3os foram\ncomuns, resultando, maioritariamente, na resuspens\u00e3o do sedimento,\nmas geralmente apresentando um impacto reduzido. Todavia, a fauna\ntamb\u00e9m foi afectada, quer por danos f\u00edsicos, quer pela interac\u00e7\u00e3o com os\nmergulhadores, e num cen\u00e1rio de expans\u00e3o significativa desta actividade,\nos impactos na fauna local poder\u00e3o aumentar, com consequ\u00eancias para\nos ecossistemas de fundos rochosos da costa sul de Portugal. Na sua\nglobalidade, a informa\u00e7\u00e3o recolhida nos estudos que contemplam esta\ntese, por ser em grande parte totalmente nova para a regi\u00e3o, espera-se\nque contribua para a gest\u00e3o da zona costeira do Algarve.\n\n\n\n\n\nkeywords gorgonians; Leptogorgia; Eunicella; epibenthic associated fauna; repro-\nduction; human pressure; fishing; scuba diving; Algarve\n\nAbstract The ecological role of gorgonians (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) in marine\nrocky bottoms is worldwide recognized, but the knowledge on the ecology\nand biology of NE Atlantic temperate species is insufficient, considering\ncurrent global, regional and local threats. In the rocky bottoms of\nthe Algarve several gorgonians were abundant and frequent down to\n30 m, namely Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa,\nLeptogorgia lusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa. There is a high\nassociation of several gorgonian species that co-dominate assemblages,\nindicating low levels of competition among species. Nevertheless,\ngorgonian assemblages differed in structure, depending on local condi-\ntions. All species evidenced a similar depth pattern, i.e. abundance\nsignificantly increased with depth below 15 m. At shallower waters (up\nto 15 m), the distribution of gorgonians may be constrained by abiotic\nfactors and competition with algae. Indeed, the spatial patterns of\ngorgonian populations along the southern coast of Portugal were driven\nby the interaction of both natural and anthropogenic pressures (namely\nfishing). Although larger colonies were not restricted to the sites with\nlower fishing pressure, gorgonian populations sampled in more intensively\nfished areas generally presented skewed distributions towards small sizes.\nThe effects of natural disturbance events on the structure of gorgonian\npopulations were evidenced by distinct demographic patterns in nearby\nareas under similar anthropogenic pressure. The present studies also\nshowed that the effect of disturbance on size-frequency distribution of\ngorgonian populations is species-dependent: Eunicella labiata does not\nseem to be affected; Leptogorgia sarmentosa is likely affected mainly\nby anthropogenic pressures; Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica\nseem to be affected by both kinds of stress. The effects on size-\nfrequency distributions patterns, namely the trend to skewed distribution\ntowards small sizes under disturbance may have consequences for\nbiodiversity of rocky sublittoral areas of the Algarve coast. Indeed, the\npresent study supports the general paradigm that corals are habitats of\nenhanced abundance and biodiversity. In one of the few studies examining\nthe relationship between gorgonians and their associated non-colonial\nepifaunal assemblages, gorgonians (Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia\nlusitanica) were found to support rich (11 phyla, 181 taxa) and abundant\n(7284 individuals) assemblages. The present study supports the general\nparadigm that corals are habitats of enhanced abundance and biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one of the few studies examining the relationship between gorgonians\nand their associated non-colonial epifaunal assemblages, gorgonians\n(Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica) were found to support rich\n(11 phyla, 181 taxa) and abundant (7284 individuals) assemblages. These\nepifaunal assemblages were dominated by amphipods, but polychaetes\nhad a relevant contribute to diversity. Colony size was found to have a\nrelevant role on biodiversity patterns, with small size colonies contributing\nthe least for overall biodiversity. Although both gorgonians shared most\nof the species collected, 11 and 18 taxa were exclusively associated\nwith Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively (without\nconsidering singletons). Nevertheless, most of these exclusive taxa\nwere either rare or uncommon. The exception was the presence of\nwhite flatworms Turbellaria in Eunicella gazella colonies probably taking\nadvantage of crypsis with the white Eunicella gazella branches. Indeed,\ncomplementarity in the epifaunal assemblages associated with the two gor-\ngonian hosts decreased when data was analysed after presence/absence\ntransformation, suggesting that patterns of biodiversity are more affected by\nchanges in the relative abundance of dominant species rather than in faunal\ncomposition. Gorgonian epifaunal assemblages not only showed high\nvalues of ?-diversity but intricate patterns of variability in their composition\nand structure leading to high ?-diversity. Although the total pool of species\navailable in gorgonian colonies appears to be the same in both sites\nanalysed, each colony yields a rather small set of this species pool. All\ntogether, the colonies may act as a metacommunity, but the structure of\nthe assemblage in each colony (e.g. total number of species, dominance)\napparently depends upon host attributes, namely the surface available for\ncolonization (colony height, width and area), complexity and heterogeneity\n(fractal dimension and lacunarity respectively) and \u201ccolonial\u201d epibiont cover\n(e.g. colonial fauna and macroscopic algae; CEC). In a first attempt to\nexplicitly quantify the link between gorgonians and the abundance and\nspecies richness of associated non-colonial epifaunal invertebrates, the\nnature and intensity of these relationships were found to be not only\nhost-dependent but varied from one taxonomic group to another. In all\nfaunal groups associated with the two gorgonian hosts analysed, the\nspecies richness and abundance were strongly correlated with CEC. In\nfact, CEC possibly due to a trophic effect (direct or indirect enhancement\nof food availability) combined with the surface available for colonization\n(species-area effect) were the strongest predictors of species richness and\nabundance. On the other hand, although structural complexity is usually\nindicated as the main driver for the rich and abundant coral-associated\nassemblages, fractal dimension and lacunarity were only relevant for the\nassemblages associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica. The validity of the\nparadigm that structural complexity enhances biodiversity may be scale-\ndependent. In the case of gorgonians, the effect of complexity at the\n\u201cgarden\u201d level may be much more relevant than at the individual colony\nlevel reinforcing the need for the conservation of gorgonian aggregation\nareas as a whole in order to preserve host diversity and size structure.\nOn the other hand, although structural complexity is usually indicated as\nthe main driver for the rich and abundant coral-associated assemblages,\nfractal dimension and lacunarity were only relevant for the assemblages\nassociated with Leptogorgia lusitanica.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe validity of the paradigm that structural complexity enhances biod-\niversity may be scale-dependent.

Anthropogenic activities like fishing may also have\na negative impact on reproduction. Likewise the lack of information on\ndistribution patterns of gorgonian assemblages and their role on local\nbiodiversity patterns, no information was available for the Algarve coast\nconcerning reproductive patterns of main gorgonian species. The annual\ndevelopment of reproductive structures in Eunicella gazella populations\n(16 m depth) was highly synchronized between sexes. The sex ratio of the\npopulation was 1.09 (F:M) being close to parity. The spermatogenic cycle\nextended for six to eight months, but the oogenic cycle was much longer,\ntaking more than one year for mature oocytes to develop. Prior to spawning,\nhigh fecundity was observed in females (27.30 \u00b1 13.24 oocytes polyp?1)\nand males (49.30 \u00b1 31.14 sperm sacs polyp?1). These values are amongst\nthe highest values reported to date in temperate gorgonians. Broadcast\nspawning of the gametes (no evidence of surface or internal brooding)\noccurred in September/October after a period of high sea surface\ntemperatures during summer. Females release large sized mature\noocytes but retain immature oocytes that develop only in the next season.\nAlthough the effect of fishing on gorgonian assemblages in the Algarve\ncoast is apparent, at current rates, scuba diving does not seem to\nseriously affect gorgonians. However, this is a growing industry and the\npreference of scuba divers for natural rocky areas with diverse fauna is\nwell known, which put these habitats under threat. The monitoring of\nscuba divers in the Algarve showed that most of them (88.6 %) have\nbehaviours that can impact the habitat, presenting a mean contact rate\nof 0.340 \u00b1 0.028 contacts min?1 (\u00b1SE). This rate was higher in scuba divers\nwith moderate experience, and in the initial part of the dive (0\u201310 min).\nContacts with fins and hands were common, mainly resulting in sediment\nre-suspension, but generally presenting low impact. However, fauna was\nalso affected by physical damage and interactions, and under a scenario\nof significant expansion of this activity, the impacts on local fauna may\nincrease with consequences for the sublittoral rocky ecosystems of the\nAlgarve coast. Overall, the information gathered in this thesis, most of it\ncompletely new for the region, is expected to have a major contribution for\nthe management of the Algarve coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nList of Figures viii\n\nList of Tables xi\n\nIntroduction 1\nI.1.

Gorgonians\n\nMorphology and systematics\n\nCnidaria are one of the most conspicuous faunal groups in marine ecosystems, with species\n\noccupying a diversity of habitats from the intertidal zone to abyssal plains (Daly et al., 2007). The\n\nclass Anthozoa, a monophyletic clade from the phyllum Cnidaria, comprises solitary, clonal or co-\n\nlonial polypoid organisms, with approximately 7500 extant species (Daly et al., 2007). Anemones,\n\ncorals, seapens and seafans are just some examples of groups of anthozoans that are commonly\n\nfound in marine habitats.\n\nThe class Anthozoa is comprised by two main monophyletic groups: the Hexacorallia, all\n\nscleractinian and black corals, tube anemones, and sea anemones (? 4300 species); and the\nOctocorallia, soft corals, gorgonians (sea fans, sea whips), sea pens, and blue coral (? 3000 species)\n(Daly et al., 2007). According to Bayer (1981), gorgonians are octocorals with a supporting skeletal\n\naxis belonging to the order Alcyonacea (Daly et al., 2007), that presents two morphologically separ-\n\nated suborders, the Calcaxonia and the Holaxonia. Even though many families and genera require\n\nextensive taxonomic revision (McFadden et al., 2006; Daly et al., 2007), several famillies are widely\n\ndistributed and speciose, namely Primnoidae, Isididae, Elisellidae, Plexauridae, Gorgoniidae, and\n\nAcanthogorgiidae (Daly et al., 2007).\n\nGorgonians are common and conspicuous in reef areas around the world (Etnoyer et al.,\n\n2010). These organisms possess an internal axial organic skeleton (proteinaceous material known\n\nas gorgonin, a tanned collagen or calcite) secreted by the coenenchyme, essentially to provide\n\nefficient filtering of food particles and to withstand strong currents (chapter 14, Ehrlich, 2010). Ad-\n\nditionally, sclerites (mainly of calcite) compose the internal skeleton supporting and maintaining\n\nthe shape of the organism, but are also important for protection, anchorage for the musculature\n\nand mineral storage (Fautin and Mariscal, 1991). Gorgonians are modular organisms, i.e. each\n\nindividual (a colony) is formed by multiple units (modules), the polyps, distributed over the\n\ncoenenchyme (mesoglea) around the gorgonian axis. Octocoral polyps are mainly composed by\n\nthe coelenteron (gastric cavity), which is radially divided by eight mesenteries, the stomodeum\n\n(pharynx), a tube of tissue extending from the mouth to the coelenteron, the oral disk and\n\npinnatelly branched tentacles that protrude from the oral disk between the mesenteries (Fautin\n\nand Mariscal, 1991). Polyps are interconnected by the existence of numerous stem canals and\n\nsolenia in the coenenchyme that are used for food and water transport (Fautin and Mariscal, 1991).\n\nThe mesenteries have several functions, namely related to reproduction, digestion and circulation\n\n(Fautin and Mariscal, 1991).\n\n2\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe ecological role of gorgonians\n\nGorgonians are long lived sessile colonial organisms, often presenting slow growth and low\n\ndynamics (Coma et al., 1998b; Garrabou and Harmelin, 2002; Linares et al., 2007, 2010). Because\n\nof their modular nature and internal skeletons that provide both stability (calcite) and flexibility\n\n(gorgonin) (Ehrlich, 2010) gorgonians can attain large sizes (Fautin and Mariscal, 1991), and persist\n\nfor long periods of time in benthic marine habitats. Similarly to hard corals, gorgonians can\n\nbe considered as ecosystem engineers as they \u201cdirectly or indirectly modulate the availability\n\nof resources (other than themselves) to other species\u201d and \u201cmodify, maintain and/or create\n\nhabitats\u201d (Jones et al., 1994). Their three-dimensional structure in the benthic realm provides\n\nniches that can be used or occupied by other species (physical engineering). What is more,\n\ntheir presence may also facilitate the colonization of space by other species (Begon et al., 2006).\n\nErect sessile organisms with complex three-dimensional structures, when sufficiently dense, can\n\ndecrease water movements and enhance finer sediments accumulation (Bruno and Kennedy,\n\n2000), creating a gradient of environmental conditions that can be efficiently used by other species\n\n(Cerrano et al., 2009). Within gorgonian gardens, the effects of such role are for example increased\n\nbiodiversity and faunal biomass (Linares et al., 2007; Cerrano et al., 2009), which can persist and\n\nbe relevant over long temporal scales from decades to centuries (Cerrano et al., 2009).\n\nIn marine habitats, several species are associated with gorgonians. Filter-feeders hold to\n\ngorgonian branches while feeding, some species predate on their polyps and others use the gor-\n\ngonian for protection (Krieger and Wing, 2002; Buhl-Mortensen et al., 2010). Fish are commonly\n\nfound in the vicinity of gorgonians (Figure I.1) (Wolff et al., 1999; Buhl-Mortensen et al., 2010),\n\nsometimes at very short distances (less than one fish length; Bright, 2007) and the composition\n\nof fish assemblages has been found to be related to the presence of gorgonians (Gratwicke et al.,\n\n2006). Moreover, both adults and juveniles of important commercial species (fish and crustaceans)\n\nhave been found to be associated with dense gorgonian gardens (Stone, 2006). Even though fish\n\nnormally do not feed on gorgonians due to chemical defence by secondary metabolites (O\u2019Neal\n\nand Pawlik, 2002), the butterflyfish Chaetodon capistratus is known to feed on the polyps of\n\ngorgonians, especially of the larger colonies (Lasker, 1985). Other fish species, such as the goby\n\nBryaninops amplus, use gorgonians for protection, but this effect is dependent of colony height\n\nand gorgonian architecture and fish size is limited by colony width (Sih and Chouw, 2009).\n\nIn the coralligenous assemblages of the Mediterranean Sea, gorgonians are considered import-\n\nant \u201cengineering\u201d or foundation species (Mistri and Ceccherelli, 1994; Linares et al., 2005; Coma\n\net al., 2006; Linares et al., 2008a,d; Cupido et al., 2009; Gori et al., 2011b; Huete-Stauffer et al.,\n\n2011). Setting the ecological attributes of a species under theoretical frameworks and concepts\n\nsometimes results in confounding those concepts. Gorgonians are probably better defined as\n\nbiogenic or foundational species as they create biogenic habitats. Regardless the term used to\n\n3\n\n\n\nGORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION\n\nFigure I.1.: Fish using the habitat provided by gorgonians. top-left: bluestriped grunt (Haemolum sciurus)\nsheltering near a Gorgonia ventalina colony (Mexico); top-right: a small group of bluestriped\ngrunts passing nearby a Plexaura sp. colony used by one individual of the same species (Mexico);\nbottom-left: Serranus atricauda slowly swimming close to Leptogorgia lusitanica, Leptogorgia\nlusitanica and Eunicella labiata colonies (Pedra da Greta, Algarve); bottom-right: Diplodus\nsargus calmly swimming by a Eunicella labiata colony. All photos by Jo\u00e3o C\u00fardia.\n\n4\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nclassify these organisms, the scale of the effects of \u201cengineering\u201d or foundation species depends\n\ngreatly on their density, spatial distribution and capacity per capita (depending on size for benthic\n\nsuspension feeders) (Jones et al., 1997). Therefore, all the factors impacting local and regional\n\npopulations of foundation species are likely to affect their associated species (Meadows et al., 2012)\n\nand ultimately their ecological role.\n\nGoods and services associated with gorgonians\n\nSimilarly to coral reefs, gorgonian gardens may provide an array of goods and ecological\n\nservices that are summarized in Table I.1. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge the goods and\n\nservices provided by those specific habitats in order to shed light on the associated cost of loosing\n\nor restore them in the future (Barbier, 2012).\n\nIn recent years the demand for natural bioactive compounds by the pharmaceutical industry\n\nled to many investigations concerning gorgonian compounds, especially because many gorgo-\n\nnians present chemical defence against predators (e.g. Van Alstyne and Paul, 1992; Koh et al.,\n\n2000; O\u2019Neal and Pawlik, 2002; Changyun et al., 2008) and disease agents (e.g. Kim et al., 2000;\n\nShapo et al., 2007). From 1998 to 2009, a total of 263 scientific articles were published in peer\n\nreviewed journals concerning gorgonians (http://isiwebofknowledge.com). The majority of those\n\narticles (173; 65.8 %) were related to bioactive compounds isolated from these organisms, many\n\nof them new to science. With respect to gorgonian species occurring in the south of Portugal,\n\nbioactive compounds have been extracted from Leptogorgia sarmentosa (Garrido et al., 2000;\n\nBoonananwong et al., 2008) and Eunicella labiata (Roussis et al., 1996). The remaining species\n\nfrom the Portuguese coast, to the author best knowledge, have not been screened for bioactive\n\ncompounds, and therefore remain as potential sources of new chemical products. Some of those\n\ncompounds may prove valuable for human health as antitumoral, anti-inflamatory, antimalarial,\n\nantimicrobial and antituberculosis agents (Bhakuni and Rawat, 2005; Ioannou et al., 2008; Berrue\n\nand Kerr, 2009; Rocha et al., 2011). Some diterpenoids and pyridines can also be an ecological\n\nalternative to the banned chemical anti-fouling agents (Qian et al., 2010; Rocha et al., 2011), as\n\nthe fouling of human made structures in the sea represents significant costs especially concerning\n\nshipping (Schultz et al., 2011).\n\nIn the Algarve, the scuba diving industry has been growing in the past few years (Santos et al.,\n\n2006). Together with large sized fishes and shoals, and commercial shellfish species, gorgonian\n\ngardens are considered the top features of a good diving spot in the region. Even though not\n\nevaluated at present, healthy gorgonian gardens per se may add value to the region, especially\n\nif the scuba divers are aware of the ecological relevance of gorgonians as they already value the\n\naesthetics and structure provided by seascapes characterized by large colonies and high density\n\nand diversity of gorgonians (Rodrigues, 2008).\n\n5\n\nhttp://isiwebofknowledge.com\n\n\nGORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION\n\nT\na\n\nb\nle\n\nI.1\n.:G\n\no\no\n\nd\ns\n\na\nn\n\nd\ne\n\nco\nlo\n\ng\nica\n\nlse\nrvice\n\ns\no\n\nf\ng\n\no\nrg\n\no\nn\n\nia\nn\n\ng\na\n\nrd\ne\n\nn\ns.\n\nA\nd\n\na\np\n\nte\nd\n\nfro\nm\n\nM\no\n\nb\ne\n\nrg\na\n\nn\nd\n\nF\no\n\nlk\ne\n\n,1\n9\n\n9\n9\n\n.\n\nG\no\n\no\nd\n\ns\nE\n\nco\nsystem\n\nservices\n\nR\ne\n\nn\ne\n\nw\na\n\nb\nle\n\nre\nso\n\nu\nrce\n\ns\nB\n\nio\ntic\n\nB\nio\n\ng\ne\n\no\nch\n\ne\nm\n\nica\nl\n\nIn\nfo\n\nrm\na\n\ntio\nn\n\nS\no\n\ncia\nla\n\nn\nd\n\ncu\nltu\n\nra\nl\n\nW\nith\n\nin\nh\n\na\nb\n\nita\nts\n\nB\netw\n\neen\nh\n\na\nb\n\nita\nts\n\nS\ne\n\na\nfo\n\no\nd\n\np\nro\n\nd\nu\n\ncts\nM\n\na\nin\n\nte\nn\n\na\nn\n\nce\no\n\nf\nh\n\na\nb\n\nita\nts\n\nB\nio\n\nlo\ng\n\nica\nlsu\n\np\np\n\no\nrt\n\nth\nro\n\nu\ng\n\nh\n\u201cm\n\no\nb\n\nile\nlin\n\nk\ns\u201d\n\nC\nO\n\n2\n/C\n\na\nb\n\nu\nd\n\ng\ne\n\nt\nco\n\nn\ntro\n\nl\nM\n\no\nn\n\nito\nrin\n\ng\na\n\nn\nd\n\np\no\n\nllu\ntio\n\nn\nre\n\nco\nrd\n\nS\nu\n\np\np\n\no\nrt\n\nre\ncre\n\na\ntio\n\nn\n\nR\na\n\nw\nm\n\na\nte\n\nria\nls\n\nfo\nr\n\nm\ne\n\nd\nicin\n\ne\nM\n\na\nin\n\nte\nn\n\na\nn\n\nce\no\n\nf\nb\n\nio\nd\n\nive\nrsity\n\na\nn\n\nd\na\n\ng\ne\n\nn\ne\n\ntic\nlib\n\nra\nry\n\nW\na\n\nste\na\n\nssim\nila\n\ntio\nn\n\nC\nlim\n\na\nte\n\nre\nco\n\nrd\nA\n\ne\nsth\n\ne\ntic\n\nva\nlu\n\ne\ns\n\na\nn\n\nd\na\n\nrtistic\nin\n\nsp\nira\n\ntio\nn\n\nB\nio\n\nlo\ng\n\nica\nlm\n\na\nin\n\nte\nn\n\na\nn\n\nce\no\n\nf\nre\n\nsilie\nn\n\nce\nS\n\nu\nsta\n\nin\nin\n\ng\nth\n\ne\nlive\n\nlih\no\n\no\nd\n\no\nf\n\nco\nm\n\nm\nu\n\nn\nitie\n\ns\n\nR\ne\n\ng\nu\n\nla\ntio\n\nn\no\n\nf\ne\n\nco\nsyste\n\nm\np\n\nro\nce\n\nsse\ns\n\na\nn\n\nd\nfu\n\nn\nctio\n\nn\ns\n\n6\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDue to their ecological role mentioned above, gorgonians may also provide increased fishing\n\nyield, as some commercial fish species are associated to gorgonian habitats (Wolff et al., 1999),\n\nbut also because they may provide the links between fish habitats (Moberg and Folke, 1999)\n\nfunctioning as \u201cstepping stones\u201d.\n\nI.2. Algarve underwater: threatened natural heritage\n\nThe Algarve coast\n\nThe Algarve region comprises an area of 4996.8 km with its coastline extending for 320 km\n\n(www.ine.pt). The coast presents a high diversity of features, such as abrupt and jagged coastlines,\n\nextensive sandy beaches, salt marshes, sand dunes and inlets forming lagoons (INAG, 2011). In\n\ngeneral, the western coast of the Algarve (Barlavento) is characterized by rocky formations of\n\nseveral types (e.g. underwater spurs, boulders, smooth rocky plateaus) and different sediment\n\ndynamics. In the eastern coast (Sotavento), the shallow sublittoral area (down to 30 m depth) is\n\ncharacterized by low relief sandy areas and rocky bottoms are scarce. From Cabo Santa Maria (near\n\nFaro, central part of the Algarve) to Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio (bordering Spain), there are only two\n\nlarge rocky areas, Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril. Apart from these two areas, only small rocky\n\nreefs (less than 200 m in length) can be found scattered over the large sandy areas. The scarcity of\n\nrocky bottoms led to the deployment of large sized artificial reefs off the southern coast from 1990\n\nto 2003 (Santos et al., 2011) for fisheries and conservation purposes. According to Fabi et al. (2011),\n\nthe overall artificial reef complex consists of more than 21 500 concrete modules, occupying, in a\n\ndiscontinuous way, a total area of 43 km.\n\nThe climate in the region is temperate with average maximum air temperature ranging from\n\n16.1 ( January) to 29.0 ?C (August) (Instituto de Meteorologia, 2012). Sea breezes prevail for 70 % of\nthe year in the south coast of Portugal, characterized by low wave action during the day rising\n\nto about 1 m height waves from SW at sunset decreasing to less than 0.5 m during the night,\n\ngenerally with weak residual waves from the SW during the day (Pires, 1985). Storms from SW\n\n(64 %), especially during winter, are the most energetic wave conditions in the Algarve, with waves\n\nfrequently higher than 6 m (Costa et al., 2001). Storms from SE (32 %) can generate waves up to 5 m\n\nwith short period and associated to strong winds from SE (Costa et al., 2001). The tidal regime is\n\nsemi-diurnal and mesotidal with tides ranging from 1.36\u20132.70 m during neap tides and from 0.64\u2013\n\n3.82 m during spring tides (Moura et al., 2006). In general, the circulation patterns in the Iberian\n\nPeninsula are dominated by up-welling (summer) and down-welling (winter) events associated\n\nto northerly and southerly winds, coupled to the North Atlantic Oscillation (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2007).\n\nThe coastal flow along the SW Iberian Peninsula has an alternating nature, featuring sharp current\n\n7\n\nwww.ine.pt\n\n\nGORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION\n\ninversions on time scales of less than 2 days (Relvas et al., 2007), with a dominant alongshore flow\n\non the inner shelf (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2006). Topological features, such as the submarine canyon of\n\nPortim\u00e3o and the Cape S\u00e3o Vicente provide instability, forming eddies that change the circulation\n\npatterns at the mesoscale (Cherubin et al., 2000).\n\nBenthic communities of Algarve sublittoral rocky areas\n\nThe shallow sublittoral coastal rocky habitats of the Algarve (<30 m) have been poorly studied\nuntil recently (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2004, 2007, 2010). The shallow rocky areas of the region can be\n\ndivided in two main groups, rocky areas extending from the shore and isolated rocky formations\n\nof variable dimensions. In the Sotavento, only the latter group occurs. In the Algarve the\n\nsublittoral rocky areas have Atlantic and Mediterranean affinities and are subjected to moderate\n\nenergy (according to the European Nature Information System \u2013 EUNIS criteria). The benthic\n\nhabitats present an abundant and diverse flora dominated by red algae covering the rocky surfaces\n\n(Mesophyllum spp., Lithophyllum spp., Lithothamnion spp., and Peyssonelia spp.) forming banks\n\nof coralligenous frameworks, with some erect algae (mostly from genera Halimeda and Flabellia)\n\n(Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2004, 2007, 2010). The invertebrate community is diverse with several species of\n\nGastropoda and a wide array of suspension feeders (gorgonians, sponges, hydrozoans, serpulids\n\nand tunicates) (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2004, 2007, 2010). The fish communities in rocky areas are also\n\ndiverse being dominated by Sparidae, Labridae and Gobiidae (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2007, 2010).\n\nThree biotopes have been described (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2007, 2010) regarding the faunal com-\n\nmunities of these habitats: coastal and deep infralittoral rock (EUNIS A3.24); and circalittoral rock\n\n(EUNIS A4.27). The coastal infralittoral rock (depth&lt;9 m) is mainly dominated by algae (Halopteris\nfilicina, Litophyllum incrustans, Corallina elongata, Cystoseira spp., Plocamium cartilagineum,\n\nDictyota dichotoma and Asparagopsis armata), but also presents invertebrate fauna, such as\n\nthe cnidarian Anemonia sulcata, the sponge Phorbas fictius and herbivores like the gastropod\n\nGibbula cineraria and the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. In the deep infralittoral biotope (9\u2013\n\n21 m depth), algae are less dominant, but Litophyllum incrustans and Dictyota dichotoma are\n\nstill characteristic, as well as several suspension feeding species such as the sponges Phorbas\n\nfictitius and Cliona viridis, the bryozoans Turbicellopora spp. and Myriapora truncata and the\n\ngorgonians Eunicella gazella and Eunicella verrucosa. Gastropod species (Bolma rugosa and\n\nHexaplex trunculus) and the cnidarians Anemonia sulcata, Aiptasia diaphana and Corynactis\n\nviridis are also abundant (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2007, 2010). In the circalittoral rocky areas (21\u201330 m\n\ndepth) the benthic communities are dominated by animals, namely conspicuous invertebrates,\n\nsuch as the gorgonians Eunicella labiata, Eunicella verrucosa, Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia\n\nsarmentosa, the sponges Phorbas fictius, Axinella polypoides, Cliona viridis and Crella fusigera and\n\nthe bryozoan Pentapora foliacea but also smaller organisms, such as the anthozoans Parazoanthus\n\n8\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\naxinellae and Alcyonium acaule and the bryozoan Myriapora truncata (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2007,\n\n2010).\n\nIn the Algarve, the deep infralittoral and especially the circalittoral rocky areas are dominated\n\nby dense gorgonian gardens composed by several species, namely Eunicella labiata, Eunicella\n\nverrucosa, Eunicella gazella, Leptogorgia sarmentosa (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2010) and Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica.\n\nAccording to the works by Grasshoff (1972, 1977, 1988, 1992); Carpine and Grasshoff (1975);\n\nVieira (2008) the gorgonian fauna reported for the Algarve waters to 100 m comprise the following\n\nspecies:\n\n\u2022 Suborder: HO L AXO N I A\n\n\u2013 Family: GO RG O N I I D A E\n\n* Eunicella gazella Studer, 1878\n\n* Eunicella labiata Thompson, 1927\n\n* Eunicella singularis (Esper, 1791)\n\n* Eunicella verrucosa (Pallas, 1766)\n\n* Leptogorgia lusitanica Stiasny, 1937\n\n* Leptogorgia sarmentosa (Esper, 1789)\n\n* Leptogorgia viminalis (Pallas, 1766)\n\n\u2013 Family: PL E X AU R I D A E\n\n* Spinimuricea atlantica ( Johnson, 1862)\n\n* Spinimuricea klavereni (Carpine &amp; Grasshoff, 1992)\n\n* Paramuricea macrospina (Koch, 1882)\n\nNatural and anthropogenic impacts in the Algarve coast\n\nUnfortunately, natural and anthropogenic pressures threaten the health of gorgonian gardens,\n\njeopardising the benefits deriving from the services and goods that they provide.\n\n9\n\n\n\nGORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION\n\nThe human population in the Algarve (residents) is increasing since the 1970s (CCDR Al-\n\ngarve, 2011d; Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica, 2011) and in the period between 2001 and 2009\n\npresented a mean population growth of 1.31 % (Carrilho and Patr\u00edcio, 2010) attaining in 2009 a\n\npopulation of ?434 000 and a mean density of 86.9 inhabitants km?2 (INE, 2010). Furthermore,\nthe Algarve population increases dramatically during summer due to tourism (CCDR Algarve,\n\n2011f). The systematic natural and seasonal increase in population led to the development of\n\nseveral infrastructures, to higher consumption of energy and water (CCDR Algarve, 2011b,a) and\n\nto increased production of waste (e.g. urban solid residues showed an increasing trend from 1999\n\nto 2006; CCDR Algarve 2011e). The local authorities have been carrying out plans to improve\n\nthe coastal zone management, namely the POOC (Planos de Ordenamento da Orla Costeira)\n\naiming at preventing or reducing impacts. However, most of the invested funds were applied in\n\nthe re-qualification of beaches (nourishment of beaches with dredged sediments) and defensive\n\ninfrastructures (such as spurs, e.g. Vilamoura) and only a small part was applied in ground-base\n\nand monitoring studies (CCDR Algarve, 2011c).\n\nThe Algarve has a long tradition of fishing, a relevant socio-economical activity including\n\nseveral important fisheries, such as the sardine, crustaceans and tuna (Oliveira das Neves, 2000;\n\nGalv\u00e3o, 2008; Mata, 2009). However, conservation actions have focused primarily on inland habit-\n\nats in tune with international laws and directives (Habitats Directive, Birds Directive, Natura 2000).\n\nAs a result, in the southern Algarve coast only Ria Formosa, Ria de Alv\u00f4r (Protected Areas) and the\n\nMartinhal islets (off Sagres, partially protected) present restrictions to fishing and therefore, the\n\nwhole coast is subjected to fishing, even though with varying intensity. Consequently, rocky areas\n\nare intensively exploited by professional and recreational fishermen because they usually present\n\nhighly appreciated and valued fish and shellfish species. Angling lines, pots, traps, trammel nets,\n\ngill nets, purse seine are commonly used fishing gear in the Algarve (e.g. Erzini et al., 1997; Santos\n\net al., 2003a; Erzini et al., 2008; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2008; Veiga et al., 2010). These are often set on\n\nor nearby rocky substrata. Storms, or other random events (e.g. interaction between passive and\n\nactive fishing gears) can displace fishing gears on the seafloor where they easily become entangled\n\nin the various features of the rocky bottom, such as large rocks, overhangs and spurs but also\n\non conspicuous living fauna such as large sponges, gorgonians and bryozoans. \u201cGhost fishing\u201d\n\n(mortality of marine fauna caused by the accidental entanglement in lost fishing gear) can be a\n\nmatter of concern in the Algarve as an estimated total of 1782 gill and trammel nets is lost every\n\nyear in the Algarve coast. The local fleet (vessels with&lt;9 m) operating mainly close to the coastline,\nup to 3 M and at depths lower than 50 m is responsible for 79 % of these lost gear and nearly a\n\nquarter of the fishing traps are lost during fishing operations (Erzini et al., 2008).\n\n10\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFigure I.2.: Gorgonians affected by fishing gears. top-left: Eunicella labiata entangled in a gill net; center-\nleft: Leptogorgia sarmentosa covered by a gill net; bottom-left: Leptogorgia sarmentosa detached\nfrom the substrate, sediment will suffocate the colony; right: Eunicella labiata entangled in lost\nfishing gears, a trammel net, the weight of the fishing gears completely bended the colony.

Not surprisingly, gorgonians are commonly collected in the Algarve\n\nby fishermen while retrieving fishing gears (Nobre, 1931; Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2008; Vieira, 2008). In\n\nfact, detachments from the substratum (Figure I.2) and injuries are the main causes of gorgonian\n\nmortality (Weinberg, 1978; Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008d). This can be a severe threat\n\nif generalized within a population or community because the recovery of detached gorgonians\n\nseems to be low (Linares et al., 2008d). On the other hand, because of the long life span of lost\n\nfishing gears materials, \u201cghost fishing\u201d can also inflict substantial damage to sessile organisms,\n\nnamely gorgonians (Morgan and Ratana, 2003). The soft tissues of entangled gorgonians are\n\nsubjected to long and continuous abrasion, damaging the animals, exposing them to disease and\n\nforcing the colony to allocate energy for regeneration purposes, normally as a trade-off on growth\n\nor reproduction (Wahle, 1983; Rinkevich, 1996; Henry and Hart, 2005).\n\nAnchoring can also impact rocky bottom\u2019s fauna (Milazzo et al., 2002; Davenport and Dav-\n\nenport, 2006; Lloret and Riera, 2008), while casting and uncasting the anchor. In the former,\n\nthe anchor may dwell on the rocky bottom destroying any structure that is found in its track.\n\nFurthermore, if the anchor becomes firmly fixed to the bottom, boat skippers tend to accelerate\n\nthe engine to release the anchor, increasing the torque and often breaking the structure holding\n\nthe anchor. Scuba diving may also affect gorgonians due to breakage or detachment, abbrasion\n\nof the coenenchyme, reduced reproduction and feeding constraints (Coma et al., 1995; Garrabou\n\net al., 1998; Luna et al., 2009; Tsounis et al., 2012). The consequences of such damages are similar\n\nto those mentioned for fishing.\n\nThe challenge of understanding the processes governing global warming is currently one of\n\nthe most demanding scientific issues, due to its impacts on human societies and also on the\n\nenvironment and the biodiversity (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010, and references therein).\n\nMass mortality events of benthic species have been linked to global warming and are well doc-\n\numented, both for coral reef ecosystems (e.g. Hughes et al., 2003; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007;\n\nHughes et al., 2010) and for Mediterranean benthic assemblages (e.g. Linares et al., 2005; Coma\n\net al., 2009; Garrabou et al., 2009; Previati et al., 2010). Solid evidence linking anomalous high\n\ntemperatures in the Mediterranean Sea to abnormal mortality of several benthic species has been\n\ngathered, namely concerning gorgonians (Schiaparelli et al., 2007; Huete-Stauffer et al., 2011). The\n\nincrease of temperature affects the metabolism of some gorgonian species; it increases the oxygen\n\nconsumption up to a temperature threshold and dramatically reduces polyp activity afterwards\n\n(and also oxygen consumption), leading to necrosis and colour change, thus severely affecting the\n\nbiology of these animals (Previati et al., 2010). Such catastrophic events affect primarily the density,\n\ngrowth and reproduction of gorgonian species (Linares et al., 2008c), leading to severe changes in\n\nspecies composition and community structure of coralligenous communities (Coma et al., 2006).\n\n12\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI.3. Objectives and the branching and modular nature of the thesis\n\nAiming at contributing to a better knowledge on the ecology and biology of gorgonian as-\n\nsemblages in the southern coast of Portugal, and to contribute to their future conservation, several\n\nstudies were designed and undertaken that make part of this thesis. Specifically, the present\n\nthesis aims to: 1) characterize the distribution patterns of gorgonians, their variability in the\n\nregion and the possible causes of such variability; 2) estimate the biodiversity that is associated\n\nwith gorgonians and investigate the factors determining diversity patterns of attendant epifaunal\n\nassemblages; 3) study the reproductive cycle of a frequent and abundant gorgonian and 4) assess\n\nthe impacts of scuba diving in the region. The thesis is organized in four parts, each addressing\n\none of the main objectives of the thesis.\n\nThe first part comprehends two chapters. In chapter 1, the abundance and frequency of the\n\nmain gorgonian species in shallow rocky bottoms are analysed over 25 km of coastline from 0 to\n\n30 m to determine the spatial variability at the local scale. In chapter 2 the following questions are\n\naddressed: i) what are the main distribution patterns of gorgonians along the southern coast of\n\nPortugal?; ii) are there differences in structure and composition of the assemblages under different\n\nintensity of disturbance?; iii) can size-frequency distributions of dominant species be used as a\n\nproxy to assess the vulnerability of the assemblages?\n\nPart II focuses the fauna that can be found living on gorgonian colonies from the Algarve.\n\nChapter 3 aims to investigate if i) different gorgonian species and ii) colonies of different size\n\npresent different epifaunal assemblages (composition and structure) and if those patterns are\n\nconsistent in space and time. In chapter 4, the effects of colony area, structural complexity,\n\nepibiont cover on the diversity and abundance of the attendant fauna of Leptogorgia lusitanica and\n\nEunicella gazella are investigated. In this chapter, it is also investigated how different taxonomic\n\nor functional groups, with different habitat requirements, respond to gorgonian attributes.\n\nThe study on the reproductive biology of Eunicella gazella presented in chapter 5, the first for\n\nthis species, aims to characterize the oogenic and spermatogenic cycles of this common species in\n\nthe Algarve, and estimate its fecundity and spawning period.\n\nChapter 6 aims to characterize the impacts of scuba diving in the Algarve, investigating also\n\nif scuba diver experience and the time of dive influence the rate of contacts and the associated\n\nimpacts to the habitat and fauna.\n\nFinally, and because the information provided by the several studies is of different nature, the\n\nmain results are integrated into general conclusions. It is also discussed how the results and\n\nconclusions can be used for management purposes and pointed out some future research.\n\n13\n\n\n\nGORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION\n\nBibliography\n\nBarbier, E.

GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ecological role of gorgonians for marine rocky bottoms is worldwide recognized, but\n\nthe information on the distribution patterns of NE Atlantic temperate species is insufficient,\n\nconsidering current global, regional and local threats. To overcome the lack of information on\n\nthe spatial distribution patterns of gorgonians in south Portugal, in 2009/2010 the occurrence\n\nand abundance of gorgonian species in rocky bottoms were quantified over more than 25 km of\n\ncoast (37.1\u00b0N/8.6\u00b0W ) down to 30 m depth. Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa\n\nand Leptogorgia sarmentosa were abundant and frequent in the studied area, while Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica was less abundant. All species evidenced a similar depth pattern, i.e. abundance\n\nsignificantly increased with depth below 15 m. At shallower waters (up to 15 m), the distribution\n\nof gorgonians may be constrained by abiotic factors and competition with algae. Indeed, the\n\nabundance of gorgonians was negatively correlated with the percentage cover of algae along the\n\ndepth gradient, but competition between gorgonians and sponges was not apparent. Competition\n\namong gorgonian species also seems to be low in this area because of the similarity in the\n\nabundance pattern observed for the most abundant species and also their high association. In NE\n\nAtlantic shallow temperate rocky bottoms, the distribution of gorgonians seems to be influenced\n\nby environmental factors and biological interactions, namely competition with algae.\n\nKeywords: gorgonians \u2022 Leptogorgia \u2022 Eunicella \u2022 spatial distribution \u2022 rocky bottoms \u2022\n\nbiological interactions\n\n1.1. Introduction\n\nGorgonians (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) are colonial organisms characterized by a hard skeleton,\n\nslow growth and long life span. Their three dimensional structure may modify the physical\n\nhabitat, by reducing current velocity, stabilising soft substrata, enhancing sedimentation and local\n\naccumulation of fine particles (Bruno and Kennedy, 2000), as well as increasing availability of\n\nniches. Because gorgonians are long-lived animals they may extend these modifications for long\n\ntime, producing significant effects in marine ecosystems, namely by enhancing local diversity\n\n(Cerrano et al., 2009). These animals are considered as ecosystem engineers (sensu Jones\n\net al., 1994, 1997), whose ecological role in ecosystem functioning has been widely acknowledged\n\n(Ballesteros, 2006; Coma et al., 2006; Cupido et al., 2008; Linares et al., 2008d), with particular\n\nemphasis on their role in marine conservation (see Wright and Jones, 2006).\n\nOver the last decades, many studies reported that gorgonians are affected by drastic, rapid\n\n28\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. SPATIAL AND DEPTH-ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF GORGONIANS IN TEMPERATE NE\nATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\nand lasting disturbances either of natural (Martin et al., 2002; Linares et al., 2005; Coma et al.,\n\n2006; Schiaparelli et al., 2007; Garrabou et al., 2009) or human origin, such as fishing (mainly\n\nbottom trammel/gill nets, bottom seine and bottom trawl) (Bavestrello et al., 1997; Willison et al.,\n\n2000; Chiappone et al., 2002, 2005), pollution (Bruno et al., 2003; Cerrano and Bavestrello, 2008),\n\nanchoring and scuba diving (Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008d). Detailed knowledge on\n\nthe distribution patterns of abundance of each species is essential to detect the human footprint\n\nin marine ecosystems and propose adequate and achievable conservation and management\n\nmeasures (Benedetti-Cecchi et al., 2003; Garc\u00eda-Charton et al., 2008; Costello et al., 2010).\n\nThe Algarve coast (southern Portugal, north-eastern Atlantic) presents a rich fauna with biogeo-\n\ngraphic affinities with the Mediterranean Sea, the Lusitanian, the west African Transition, Northern\n\nEuropean Seas and Western Atlantic provinces (sensu Spalding et al., 2007; Souto et al., 2010; Levy\n\net al., 2011), because of the proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar (Baus et al., 2005, and references\n\ntherein) and the confluence of oceanic currents (Cherubin et al., 2000; P\u00e9rez et al., 2001; Coelho\n\net al., 2002; Martins et al., 2002). However, the gorgonian populations of southern Portugal are\n\npoorly described, especially compared to the Mediterranean, where in the past few years, several\n\nstudies have been performed in shallow sublittoral waters, gathering a large amount of biological\n\nand ecological information, and building predictive models to be used in conservation plans\n\n(Linares et al., 2007, 2008d; Bramanti et al., 2009). In fact, the most recent study concerning the\n\ngorgonian fauna of the Algarve coast reported only 10 different species caught as by-catch by\n\nbottom gill nets (Vieira, 2008). Therefore, significant knowledge gaps still persist, namely on the\n\nabundance patterns in the near shore benthic community (0\u201330 m), spatial and depth distribution.\n\nIn this context, the present study aimed to quantify the occurrence and abundance of the\n\nmain gorgonian species in the shallow rocky bottoms (0 to 30 m) of the western Algarve coast\n\n(?25 km of coastline). In order to assess the relationship between the distribution of gorgonians\nand potential competitors for space and food, the percentage cover of erect algae and Porifera\n\nwere also quantified. If population dynamics of those benthic taxa is governed by competition, it\n\nis expected that the abundance of gorgonians and both erect algae and Porifera would be inversely\n\ncorrelated.\n\n1.2. Materials and Methods\n\n1.2.1. Study area\n\nThe Algarve coast (Figure 1.1) is characterized by heterogeneous coastline and sublittoral\n\nareas. The western part of the Algarve coast comprises rocky formations of several types (e.g.\n\n29\n\n\n\nPART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nFigure 1.1.: Location of the sampling sites (\u2022) in Lagos Bay.\n\nunderwater spurs, boulders, low relief rocky areas, submerged rock bottoms) and by different\n\nsediment dynamics.\n\nThe study area is located in the western Algarve coast extending from Lagos to Portim\u00e3o\n\n(Figure 1.1), hereafter designated by Lagos Bay. This area has 20.6 km2 of rocky bottoms within\n\na total area of 70 km2 (up to 30 m depth) and covers ?25 km of the Algarve coast, distancing only\n?30 km to the westernmost continental part of Europe (Cabo S\u00e3o Vicente, Sagres). In particular,\nthe coast between Ponta da Piedade and Arma\u00e7\u00e3o de P\u00eara, where this study was conducted, is\n\nmorphologically complex presenting rocky areas with cliffs forming small beaches, a large bay with\n\nextensive sandy beaches and dunes, including a coastal lagoon (Ria de Alvor) and a small estuary\n\n(Rio Arade). The shallow continental shelf (down to ?30 m depth) is generally characterized by\nrocky outcrops with pockets of rubble and/or sand (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2010).\n\nIn general, the circulation patterns in the Iberian Peninsula are dominated by up-welling\n\n(summer) and down-welling (winter) events associated to northerly/southerly winds, coupled to\n\nthe North Atlantic Oscillation (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2007). Sea surface temperature presents marked\n\nseasonal variation depending on whether down-welling or up-welling dominates (ranging from\n\n14 to 24?C, respectively; http://www.hidrografico.pt/), whereas salinity is fairly constant (35.0\u2013\n36.0).\n\n30\n\nhttp://www.hidrografico.pt/\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. SPATIAL AND DEPTH-ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF GORGONIANS IN TEMPERATE NE\nATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\n1.2.2. Species identification\n\nIdentification of gorgonian species was based on the studies by Carpine and Grasshoff (1975),\n\nGrasshoff (1988, 1992) and Gonz\u00e1lez (1993). In the Algarve coast, underwater identification of\n\ngorgonians is difficult because of ambiguities in the taxonomy of Eunicella and Leptogorgia, and\n\ntherefore the following criteria were established to identify these species:\n\nEunicella gazella \u2013 colonies always white with orange polyps; diameter of the ramets noticeably\n\nlarger than in Eunicella verrucosa; colony surface generally homogeneous with low relief and\n\nextensive branching mostly in one dimension.\n\nEunicella verrucosa \u2013 colonies with colour varying from white to cream, beige or pale orange;\n\npolyps varying from white to orange; heterogeneous surface with \u201cbumps\u201d (verrucae), usually\n\nlarger in size than Eunicella gazella.\n\nEunicella labiata \u2013 large species; colonies divided in two main branches immediately after the\n\nbase of the colony, with less branches than Eunicella verrucosa and Eunicella gazella; colours are\n\nusually darker than in the previous species, ranging from cream to dark brown; colonies are often\n\nbroken, loosing one of the main branches; conspicuous verrucae observed all over the colony,\n\nusually lighter.\n\nEunicella singularis \u2013 erect colonies with few long branches always in upright position; colonies\n\nalways white coloured; colony surface generally smooth with low relief.\n\nLeptogorgia lusitanica \u2013 bush-like colonies growing in only one dimension, perpendicular to\n\ndominant currents; terminal branches thinner than the central ones; extremely variable in colour,\n\ngenerally presenting two colours, usually wine red/purple and yellow, sometimes white and blue,\n\nand other times uniform in colour (generally white or yellow); the central branches of the colony\n\nusually lack polyps in the surface facing the currents.\n\nLeptogorgia sarmentosa \u2013 bush-like colonies growing in one or more dimensions; usually of\n\nuniform but variable colour (green, yellow, red, brick orange, rarely white); polyps usually present\n\nin all surfaces of the branches.\n\n1.2.3. Spatial and depth distribution of the main gorgonian species\n\nIn order to describe the patterns of spatial and vertical distribution of gorgonian species, a total\n\nof 69 sites were sampled by means of underwater transects by scuba diving (5 \u00d7 1 m belt transects,\n3 replicates at each site) from May 2009 to June 2010. Sampling sites were randomly selected,\n\n31\n\n\n\nPART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nbut restricted to rocky substrata, explaining the spatial gaps. In this area, gorgonians are rarely\n\nfound in soft bottoms, therefore sampling effort was directed towards rocky bottoms only. The\n\nbathymetric distribution of the gorgonian species was analysed considering the average depth of\n\neach sampling unit and estimating the median density at 6 depth levels: 0\u20135 m, 5\u201310 m, 10\u201315 m,\n\n15\u201320 m, 20\u201325 m and 25\u201330 m.\n\n1.2.4. Competition between gorgonians and other benthic groups\n\nIn order to assess competition effects between gorgonians and potential competitors for space\n\nand food, the abundance of erect algae (macroalgae and turf ) and Porifera was quantified. While\n\nconducting the censuses of the gorgonian populations, the number of sponges was counted at\n\neach transect and the percentage cover of erect algae was quantified using quadrats (1 \u00d7 1 m, 3\nreplicates).\n\n1.2.5. Statistical analyses\n\nThe distribution of gorgonian species indicated that only five out of seven species were frequent\n\nin the study area (see Results). Therefore, the comparison of the density of gorgonians at\n\ndifferent depth levels was undertaken for the overall gorgonian assemblage (all gorgonians) and\n\nfor the most frequent species (Leptogorgia sarmentosa, Leptogorgia lusitanica, Eunicella gazella,\n\nEunicella labiata and Eunicella verrucosa) using parametric (one-way ANOVA) or non-parametric\n\nmethods (Kruskal-Wallis\u2019 U test) whenever ANOVA assumptions were not met. In both cases,\n\npairwise multiple comparisons were used: Tukey Honestly Significant Differences (Tukey HSD)\n\nand Behrens-Fisher non-parametric multiple test (Berhens-Fisher) (Munzel and Hothorn, 2001),\n\nrespectively. The number of transects was not constant at each depth level, resulting in an\n\nunbalanced design, therefore depth levels with fewer samples (0\u20135 m and 25\u201330 m) were discarded\n\nto improve the power of the statistical tests. The correlation between depth and density of\n\ngorgonians was tested by means of an exponential regression using the loge (1 + y ) transformation\nof the dependent variable.\n\nNon-metric multidimensional scaling was used to analyse differences in the distribution and\n\nabundance patterns of gorgonian assemblages using the modified Gower dissimilarity index with\n\ntransformed data (log2(x + 1)). The modified Gower index (Anderson et al., 2006) is able to detect\nchanges in composition, with the advantage of being directly interpretable as the average change\n\nin orders of magnitude (defined by the transformation). By using log2 transformation the modified\n\nGower index is weighted towards a compositional change equal to a doubling in abundance\n\n(Anderson et al., 2006). To analyse the contribution of each species to the discrimination of the\n\n32\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. SPATIAL AND DEPTH-ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF GORGONIANS IN TEMPERATE NE\nATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\ncompared assemblages, the indicator value (IndVal) was used (Dufr\u00eane and Legendre, 1997). On\n\nthe other hand, the ecological association of gorgonians was quantified using three measures\n\nbased on binary data (presence-absence data): Ochiai, Dice and Jaccard (Janson and Vegelius,\n\n1981). The three measures present minimum coexistence values of 0 when the two species are\n\nnever found together and maximum coexistence values of 1 when both species always occur\n\ntogether (Janson and Vegelius, 1981).\n\nThe correlation between the abundance of gorgonians and potential competitors was assessed\n\nusing linear regression. All statistical analyses were performed using the open source software R\n\nversion 12.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010).\n\n1.3. Results\n\n1.3.1. Distribution patterns of gorgonian species\n\nOccupancy and abundance\n\nIn Lagos Bay, gorgonians were present in 134 (64.7 %) of the 207 sampling units, totalling 2481\n\ncolonies belonging to seven taxa (Table 1.1). Four species, Eunicella labiata, Eunicella verrucosa,\n\nLeptogorgia sarmentosa and Eunicella gazella, were responsible for 96.9 % of the total abundance.\n\nEunicella labiata was the most frequent and abundant species with 905 colonies, occurring in\n\n52.7 % of the transects and representing 36.5 % of the total gorgonians found. Eunicella verrucosa\n\nwas the second most frequent and abundant species with 22.4 % of the total abundance and\n\noccurring in 45.9 % of the transects. Leptogorgia sarmentosa was present in 39.6 % of the transects\n\nwith 485 colonies (19.5 %). Eunicella gazella was found in 40.1 % of the transects contributing for\n\n18.5 % of the total abundance. Leptogorgia lusitanica was found in 16.9 % of the transects and\n\ntotalling 72 colonies (2.9 %). Only three colonies of Eunicella singularis were found in a single\n\ntransect. One Eunicella colony (Eunicella sp.) could not be identified to species level.\n\nSpatial and depth distribution\n\nGenerally, gorgonians were present in the entire study area, without any evidence of spatial\n\nsegregation (Figure 1.2).\n\nIn Lagos Bay, gorgonians were found from 7.5 to 27 m (the maximum depth sampled). The\n\ndepth range of all species presented similar upper limits, with Leptogorgia sarmentosa occurring\n\n33\n\n\n\nPART I.

However, the generally\nlow indicator values (IndVal 0.31\u20130.44; p > 0.05) showed that the composition of the assemblages\nwas similar at all depth levels and most species (except Eunicella singularis) occurred in several\n\ndepth levels. The assemblage was characterized by a dynamic alternation in species rankings\n\nwith Eunicella labiata being in the top two ranks along the studied depth range and Leptogorgia\n\nsarmentosa alternating from first to fourth in rank.

Relationship between gorgonians and potential competitors\n\nThe distribution of erect algae (mainly Chlorophyta and Phaeophyta) and Porifera in Lagos Bay\n\nis also depth-dependent. The abundance of erect algae (dominated by Dictyota dichotoma, Aspar-\n\nagopsis armata, Halopteris filicina, Gelidium latifolium and Peyssonnelia rubra) declined along\n\nthe depth gradient. In the other hand, the Porifera clearly increased their abundance with depth\n\n(Figure 1.6). This group was dominated by encrusting forms such as Phorbas fictitius, Scopalina\n\nlophyropoda, Cliona viridis, Axinella damicornis and Chondrosia reniformis and massive erect\n\nforms such as Crella elegans and Axinella polypoides. A significant negative correlation (Linear\n\nregression, r 2 = 0.439, F1,11 = 8.605, p &lt;0.05) between the percentage cover of erect algae and\nthe number of gorgonian colonies was found in Lagos Bay, whereas a positive correlation (Linear\n\nregression, r 2 = 0.769, F1,11 = 36.67, p &lt;0.05) was detected between sponges and gorgonians\n(Figure 1.6).\n\n1.4. Discussion\n\nAccording to Weinberg (1978), the two main factors affecting the octocorallia communities are\n\nirradiance and presence of sediment in the substrate. The amount of light reaching an underwater\n\nsurface is related to depth, even though it depends on several factors, namely transparency and\n\nsuspended particles (Gili et al., 1989). Depth, slope and the interaction of these two factors have\n\nbeen reported as presenting a marked positive effect in Anthozoa species distribution (Gili et al.,\n\n1989). Indeed, many studies highlighted major variations of physical (e.g. currents, sedimentation)\n\nand chemical variables (organic matter content) along the depth gradient, with consequences for\n\nthe distribution of marine communities (e.g. Garrabou et al., 2002; McArthur et al., 2010).\n\nThe present study detected a clear depth pattern in the distribution of all gorgonian species in\n\nLagos Bay, suggesting that the ecology of these suspension feeders is strongly affected by environ-\n\nmental factors that may change with depth and their interactions, such as currents, sedimentation\n\nand organic matter. For most species, the general pattern found indicated increasing abundances\n\nwith depth within the analysed depth range. The present study also revealed that the 15 m\n\nbathymetric seems to be an important turning point in the distribution of most gorgonian species\n\nin Lagos Bay, which can be related to higher irradiance above this depth but also to higher surf\n\n40\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1.

GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nimpact. Indeed, in the Algarve, the lower beach profile limit (closure depth), where wave action is\n\nable to disturb the sea bottom, is around 10 m below mean sea level (Dolbeth et al., 2007; Almeida\n\net al., 2011), which is known to influence the patterns of benthic communities (Dolbeth et al.,\n\n2007; Carvalho et al., in press). The upper depth distribution limit of the dominant gorgonians in\n\nLagos Bay was very similar suggesting that they are determined by abiotic conditions as observed\n\nelsewhere (Zabala and Ballesteros, 1989; Linares et al., 2008a), especially the high water motion\n\nof shallower coastal areas. The combination of both factors (strong irradiance and surf ) was\n\nalready reported as being determinant in the distribution of western Mediterranean gorgonian\n\nspecies (Weinberg, 1978). Depth distribution in tropical shallow water gorgonians is also mainly\n\ngoverned by light (S\u00e1nchez et al., 1998) and other environmental factors affecting light (e.g. bed\n\nload, Yoshioka and Yoshioka, 1989), mainly because most species are zooxanthellate (Dahlgren,\n\n1989; S\u00e1nchez et al., 1998). In opposition, shallow water gorgonian assemblages in the Algarve are\n\ndominated by azooxanthelate octocorals, and the zooxanthelate gorgonian Eunicella singularis is\n\nrarely sampled (and the presence of zooxanthelae in the few colonies found in the Algarve was not\n\nconfirmed). Besides, in the present study, erect algae dominated the biocenoses at low depth but\n\nrapidly decreased their abundance when light intensity is reduced, with their abundance being\n\ninversely correlated to the abundance of gorgonians. In shallow water, algal-dominated benthic\n\ncommunities present species that favour out-competition processes being continuously replaced\n\n(Garrabou et al., 2002). In contrast, animal-dominating deeper communities tend to present slow\n\ngrowth species avoiding competition displacement and enhancing the maintenance of diversity\n\nand complexity (Garrabou et al., 2002). However, there is a depth range (12\u201320 m) where the abiotic\n\nconditions seem suitable both for erect algae and gorgonians where competition for space occurs,\n\nexplaining the negative correlation between the two groups. In fact, anthozoans are unable to\n\ncompete with large algae where light intensity is high (Gili et al., 1989; Zabala and Ballesteros, 1989)\n\nsupporting the idea that the bathymetric behaviour of gorgonian species in Lagos Bay may be only\n\nindirectly linked to light intensity. Therefore, ecological processes, such as competition, rather\n\nthan physical processes alone may influence the depth distribution of gorgonians in shallower\n\nwaters. In the Mediterranean, a similar model has been proposed, consisting of three zones:\n\na superficial zone (0\u201310 m) dominated by erect algae, a mixed zone (10\u201315 m) co-dominated\n\nby erect algae, crustose algae and suspension feeders and a third zone (15\u201342 m) dominated\n\nby suspension feeders (Zabala and Ballesteros, 1989). But in Lagos Bay, competition for space\n\nand food was not apparent between gorgonians and sponges. Both groups presented similar\n\ndistribution patterns with depth and were positively correlated indicating that, if competition is\n\noccurring, it is kept at low levels. The habitat requirements of the species that compose these two\n\nsuspension feeding groups are probably different with small overlap. Massive erect sponges such\n\nas Crella elegans and Axinella polypoides may compete for space with gorgonians, but these are\n\nonly a part of the Porifera assemblage (percentage cover of sponges was not assessed) dominated\n\nby encrusting forms that use the available space below erect forms efficiently. Regarding food\n\n42\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. SPATIAL AND DEPTH-ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF GORGONIANS IN TEMPERATE NE\nATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\nsources, sponges mainly feed on very small particles, such as suspended particles, free-living\n\nbacteria and colloidal organic matter, being extremely efficient at capturing particles down to\n\n0.1 \u00b5m (Ruppert and Barnes, 1994; Riisg\u00e5rd and Larsen, 2010). On the other hand, gorgonians\n\nmainly feed on larger particles such as zooplankton and particulate organic carbon, with some\n\nspecies, such as Leptogorgia sarmentosa presenting a wide spectrum of food sources being able\n\nto feed on particles as small as 4 \u00b5m (Ribes et al., 2003). Considering that, of the species found\n\nin Lagos Bay, those with smaller polyps are the Leptogorgia, it is not expectable that the feeding\n\nhabits of the remaining species considerably overlap with particles that can be filtered by sponges,\n\nthus allowing us to suggest that competition for food must be relatively low in Lagos Bay and\n\npassive (gorgonians) and active (sponges) suspension feeders can co-exist (Gili and Coma, 1998).\n\nConcerning competition between gorgonian species, the similarity in depth distribution patterns,\n\nand the high association of the most abundant species suggests that these slow-growth species are\n\nnot competing among themselves. The lower coexistence of Leptogorgia lusitanica with the more\n\nabundant species may be due to its lower abundance in Lagos Bay being absent in a high number\n\nof samples. In fact, the only case of competition between gorgonians reported for nearby areas\n\nconcerns the mutual exclusion of Eunicella cavolinii and Eunicella verrucosa in Mediterranean\n\ncoralligenous habitats (Carpine and Grasshoff, 1975). However, until now, Eunicella cavolinii has\n\nnot been found in the Algarve, and there is no evidence that Eunicella verrucosa distribution is\n\nbeing constrained by competition. It is important to notice that the strong associations found\n\nbetween the gorgonian species that are more representative of Lagos Bay should be addressed\n\nwith care as competition may take place at lower scales (<5 m). At deeper depths, where abiotic\n\nfactors are more homogeneous, benthic communities are sometimes dominated by suspension\n\nfeeders and patchy in nature (Zabala and Ballesteros, 1989; Garrabou et al., 2002), with some\n\ngorgonian species showing a patchy distribution pattern (Linares et al., 2005). In this context,\n\nscale is determinant for niche dynamics in space (Pearman et al., 2007) and the used scale may\n\nencompass different niches used contrastingly by species, with insufficient resolution to ascertain\n\ndifferences between gorgonian species.\n\nConcerning the gorgonian assemblage composition, four species are well represented in the\n\narea, with Eunicella labiata being the most abundant and Eunicella verrucosa, Eunicella gazella\n\nand Leptogorgia sarmentosa presenting similar abundance. Of these dominant gorgonians, the\n\nEunicella species are poorly represented in the Mediterranean, where shallow water gorgonian\n\nassemblages are dominated by Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis and Leptogorgia sar-\n\nmentosa (e.g. Ballesteros, 2006; Gori et al., 2011a). However, the abundance of each dominant\n\nspecies in the Mediterranean is clearly associated to habitat characteristics such as vertical fa-\n\ncies, soft bottoms, maerl, pebbles and rocks (Gori et al., 2011a), suggesting different ecological\n\nrequirements. On the contrary, in Lagos Bay, the distributions of the dominant gorgonian species\n\nwere all well correlated (species occurring at the same sites) suggesting that the rocky areas are\n\nrelatively homogeneous with respect to available niches for several gorgonian species. However,\n\n43\n\n\n\nPART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nbecause the study was restricted to rocky areas, the environmental gradients in several topographic\n\nand environmental factors that can affect the distribution of gorgonians are relatively short,\n\nminimizing the influence of those factors in the distribution of some species.\n\nThe most frequent and abundant species found, Eunicella labiata, is relatively common in\n\ncoralligenous habitats near the Strait of Gibraltar (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1993), but to the authors\u2019 best\n\nknowledge, this species has only been reported recently for the Algarve coast (Gon\u00e7alves et al.,\n\n2007; Vieira, 2008), probably resulting from erroneous identifications in the past. Another recent\n\nstudy also reported its occurrence in the Professor Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (Arr\u00e1bida, Center\n\nPortugal) (Rodrigues, 2008), where it was frequent but not dominant. Another abundant Eunicella\n\nspecies in Lagos Bay, Eunicella verrucosa has been described as an Atlantic species with a wide\n\nvertical range. In the current study, this species was found from 8 to 27 m, which agrees with\n\ndata from the Strait of Gibraltar, where it occurs from 6 to 87 m (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1993). However, in the\n\nMediterranean this species is only found at deeper waters (35 to 200 m) because of the competition\n\nwith Eunicella cavolinii, which occurs mainly between 10 and 30 m (Carpine and Grasshoff, 1975).\n\nThe wider bathymetric range observed both in Lagos Bay and the Strait of Gibraltar may be due\n\nto the lack of competitive exclusion by Eunicella cavolinii, which was not observed in both areas\n\nbut is common in the Mediterranean. The other species dominating the assemblages in Lagos\n\nBay, Eunicella gazella, presented a distribution positively correlated to that of Eunicella verrucosa,\n\nwhich once more is in agreement with the findings by Gonz\u00e1lez (1993) in the Strait of Gibraltar,\n\nwhere they are also commonly found together.\n\nThe dominance of Leptogorgia sarmentosa in the study area may be related to the presence of\n\nsediment particles in the rocky bottom. Indeed, this species is clearly associated with areas with\n\nfrequent but moderate disturbance, where sediment re-suspension is high (Gori et al., 2011a), and\n\nhas been pointed as an indicator of silt (Weinberg, 1978, reported as Leptogorgia ceratophita).\n\nAlthough it has been reported to inhabit different substrates, namely rocky areas, shells on\n\nbiodetritic sediments and sandy muddy areas (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1993), it shows a high correlation with\n\nsoft bottoms or surfaces where sediments tend to accumulate (Gori et al., 2011a). The preferential\n\ndistribution of Leptogorgia sarmentosa within areas of high sedimentation rates may be related to\n\nits feeding requirements, as it is known that re-suspended particles are particularly important for\n\nthis species\u2019 diet (Ribes et al., 2003; Rossi et al., 2004). According to our observations, sediment\n\ntransport (bed load) is high in the Lagos Bay area, probably because this area is near the Rio Arade\n\nestuary, Ria de Alvor (coastal lagoon) and Ribeira de Bensafrim (creek). The habitat conditions in\n\nLagos Bay clearly favour this species as the area is mainly characterized by low relief rocky plateaus\n\nwith a thick layer of fine sediments that are easily re-suspended (submerged rock bottoms). In the\n\nMediterranean, this species is abundant in sheltered areas with turbulent circulation but without\n\nstrong near-bottom currents (Gori et al., 2011a). Regarding Leptogorgia lusitanica, even though its\n\necological requirements are still poorly understood, it has been described as preferring habitats\n\n44\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1. SPATIAL AND DEPTH-ASSOCIATED DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF GORGONIANS IN TEMPERATE NE\nATLANTIC SHALLOW ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\nwith weak to moderate hydrodynamics but clear waters (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1993). In fact, in other areas\n\nof the Algarve coast where sedimentation and turbidity is lower, this species presents higher\n\nabundance at similar depths (e.g. Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril, authors\u2019 unpublished data).\n\nThe low abundance and frequency of occurrence of Eunicella singularis was already expected,\n\nas it is a Mediterranean species with limited distribution outside this area. This species is one of the\n\ndominant taxa in the coralligenous communities in the Mediterranean Sea (Ballesteros, 2006; Gori\n\net al., 2011a) and can be found on horizontal or slightly sloped surfaces in light-rich areas, having\n\na marked dependence on light. Indeed, this is the only gorgonian species in the Mediterranean\n\narea presenting zooxanthellae, but has been reported from 6\u201367 m. The preferential habitat\n\ndescribed for this species is frequent in the study area, but the species was rarely found in Lagos\n\nBay. We hypothesize that the colonies found in the study area are colonizers from Mediterranean\n\npopulations that under favourable conditions were able to reach and settle in suitable rocky areas\n\nof the Algarve coast.\n\nFinal remarks\n\nThe present study provides invaluable information on the spatial and depth distribution of\n\ngorgonian species in shallow rocky bottoms near the westernmost part of continental Europe.\n\nThe key role of gorgonians in the infralittoral rocky communities poses another challenge, the\n\ncapacity of these animals to cope with both thermal stress but also pathogens under a climate\n\nchange scenario, an important issue for the future management of coastal marine ecosystems. The\n\npresent data is also relevant for the establishment and management of future MPAs in southern\n\nPortugal, a common management tool in several areas of the world, namely in the Mediterranean,\n\nwhere gorgonians are used as ecological indicators. What is more, \u201ccoral gardens\u201d, including\n\ngorgonian dominated biocenoses in south Portugal and Spain have been recently proposed for\n\nthe OSPAR (Convention for the Protection of the marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic)\n\nlist of protected habitats (Anonymous, 2011). Therefore, reference data like the one provided by\n\nthis study may be relevant for future monitoring programmes. In Lagos Bay, the abundance of\n\nall gorgonian species increases with depth, showing a strong association to another suspension\n\nfeeding benthic taxa, the Porifera. The specific ecological requirements regarding space and food\n\nof the two taxonomical groups probably present low overlap, thus competition levels shall be\n\nlow. However, at shallower depths, gorgonians seem to be out-competed by algae for space, even\n\nthough the upper limit in the distribution of gorgonians in Lagos Bay is probably mostly related\n\nto abiotic factors such as high water movement. Further multidisciplinary studies, with broader\n\nspatial and temporal scales but also wider depth ranges, supported by modern technology (e.g.\n\nROVs and remote sensors) should be undertaken in order to elucidate on the abiotic and biotic\n\nfactors that might be affecting the distribution of these octocorals in the Algarve coast.\n\n45\n\n\n\nPART I.

GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nAbstract\n\nThe gorgonian fauna of the southern Portuguese coast is composed by species of different\n\norigins: NE Atlantic (Eunicella verrucosa, Leptogorgia lusitanica), Mediterranean (Leptogorgia sar-\n\nmentosa, Eunicella singularis, Paramuricea clavata) and North Africa (Eunicella labiata, Eunicella\n\ngazella), highlighting the importance of this geographical area for the fluxes of biological diversity.\n\nWhile the western Mediterranean assemblages are mainly monospecific, in the south coast of\n\nPortugal, there is a high association of several gorgonian species that co-dominate assemblages\n\neven though differing in structure. The analyses of size-frequency distributions and abundance\n\nsuggest that the spatial patterns of gorgonian distribution along the southern coast of Portugal are\n\ndriven by the interaction of both natural and anthropogenic pressures. Although larger colonies\n\nwere not restricted to the sites with lower fishing pressure, gorgonian populations sampled in more\n\nintensively fished areas generally presented skewed distributions towards small sizes, and more\n\npeaked than normal distributions. The effects of natural disturbance events on the structure of\n\ngorgonian populations were evidenced by distinct demographic patterns in nearby areas under\n\nsimilar anthropogenic pressure. The existence of a thick sediment layer over the hard bottoms in\n\nthe disturbed area suggests that sedimentation may have caused a high mortality in small sized\n\ngorgonians and prevented the settlement and/or recruitment, resulting in a bimodal distribution.\n\nThis study also provides evidence that the response of gorgonians to disturbance is species-\n\ndependent: Eunicella labiata does not seem to be affected; Leptogorgia sarmentosa seems to be\n\naffected mainly by anthropogenic pressures; Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica seem to\n\nbe affected by both kinds of stress.\n\nKeywords: shallow water gorgonians \u2022 Leptogorgia \u2022 Eunicella \u2022 spatial distribution \u2022 size-\n\nfrequency distribution \u2022 species coexistence \u2022 disturbance \u2022 fisheries\n\n2.1. Introduction\n\nGorgonians are colonial organisms with a relevant role in the marine ecosystem namely by sta-\n\nbilising soft-substrata, enhancing sedimentation and promoting the increase of local biodiversity\n\n(Bruno and Kennedy, 2000; Cerrano et al., 2009). Nevertheless, over the last decades, several\n\nstudies reported that gorgonians are severely affected either by anthropogenic pressure, such as\n\nfishing (Bavestrello et al., 1997; Willison et al., 2000; Chiappone et al., 2002, 2005), anchoring, scuba\n\ndiving (Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008d; Di Franco et al., 2009) and pollution (Bruno et al.,\n\n2003; Cerrano and Bavestrello, 2008), or natural disturbances (Martin et al., 2002; Linares et al.,\n\n2005; Coma et al., 2006; Burkepile and Hay, 2007; Schiaparelli et al., 2007; Garrabou et al., 2009;\n\n54\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE\nOF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL\n\nGarc\u00eda-Matucheski and Muniain, 2010; Huete-Stauffer et al., 2011). Anthropogenic pressures are\n\nknown to cause partial or total mortality of the gorgonian colonies, reduction in competitive ability,\n\nhigher risk of disease, and lower growth rates, fertility and reproductive capacity (e.g. Weinberg,\n\n1978; Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008c). Besides, the effects of human activities are known to\n\nbe size-dependent (Shin et al., 2005; Jennings and Reynolds, 2007). Body size of a species is crucial\n\nfor its ecology, life history, population dynamics, and exploitation vulnerability, since it is related\n\nto life history traits such as somatic growth rate, fecundity and age at maturity (Reynolds et al.,\n\n2001), namely in scleractinian corals (Meesters et al., 2001) and octocorals (Yoshioka, 1994; Coma\n\net al., 1995; Tsounis et al., 2006; Linares et al., 2007). Consequently, size-frequency distributions of\n\nmarine species have been used for environmental impact assessment (Shin et al., 2005).\n\nIn the past few years, management plans focusing on the whole ecosystem have been advocated\n\n[Ecosystem Based Management (McLeod et al., 2005) and Ecosystem Approaches to Management\n\n(Murawski, 2007)], and the need for data on ecosystem structure, namely at the population level\n\nhas been emphasized (e.g. Levin and Lubchenco, 2008; Ellis et al., 2011). Particularly in the\n\nMediterranean, several studies have been undertaken in order to gather a large set of biological\n\nand ecological information regarding gorgonian fauna (Linares et al., 2007, 2008d; Bramanti et al.,\n\n2009). Indeed, information on spatial distribution patterns, growth, reproduction and dispersion\n\nis crucial to build up predictive models to be used in conservation plans (Benedetti-Cecchi et al.,\n\n2003; Garc\u00eda-Charton et al., 2008; Costello et al., 2010). In contrast, information concerning spatial\n\ndistribution and ecological requirements of shallow water gorgonians in the NE Atlantic is scarce,\n\nnamely in the south coast of Portugal. Because of its geographic location, this area harbours a rich\n\nmarine fauna with biogeographic affinities to the Temperate Northern Atlantic (Mediterranean\n\nSea, Lusitanian and Northern European Seas provinces) and Tropical Atlantic (the west African\n\nTransition, and Northwestern/Southwestern Atlantic provinces) (sensu Spalding et al., 2007; Souto\n\net al., 2010; Levy et al., 2011), because of the proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar (Baus et al.,\n\n2005, and references therein) and the confluence of different oceanic currents (Cherubin et al.,\n\n2000; P\u00e9rez et al., 2001; Coelho et al., 2002; Martins et al., 2002). As such, it is expected that this\n\narea presents particular features in what concerns the composition and structure of gorgonian\n\nfauna. Besides, information on such a particular geographic area can also be crucial for a better\n\nknowledge on the patterns and processes underlying the overall distribution of gorgonians in\n\nAtlantic and Mediterranean waters.\n\nTo overcome the lack of information on the occurrence and abundance distribution patterns of\n\ngorgonian species of shallow rocky habitats, several transects were established along the southern\n\ncoast of Portugal. Because previous studies showed that gorgonian populations may be affected\n\nby anthropogenic activities, sampling comprised areas under different levels of human pressure.\n\nTherefore, the present study aims at contributing for an insight knowledge on shallow water\n\ngorgonians in the NE Atlantic rocky habitats and to assess potential effects of anthropogenic\n\n55\n\n\n\nPART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nactivities on such populations. Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: i) what are\n\nthe main distribution patterns of gorgonians along the southern coast of Portugal?; ii) are there\n\ndifferences in structure and composition of the assemblages under different intensity of human\n\npressure?; iii) can size-frequency distributions of dominant species be used as a proxy to assess\n\nthe vulnerability of the assemblages?\n\n2.2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.2.1. Study area\n\nThis study was conducted in the south coast of Portugal (Algarve), characterized by het-\n\nerogeneous coastline and sublittoral areas. In general, the circulation patterns in the Iberian\n\nPeninsula are dominated by seasonal upwelling (spring-summer) and downwelling (winter) events\n\nassociated to northerly and southerly winds, coupled to the North Atlantic Oscillation (S\u00e1nchez\n\net al., 2007). The coastal flow along the SW Iberian Peninsula has an alternating nature, featuring\n\nsharp current inversions on time scales of less than two days (Relvas et al., 2007), with a dominant\n\nalongshore flow on the inner shelf of the northern margin of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz (S\u00e1nchez et al.,\n\n2006). Topographic features such as the submarine canyon of Portim\u00e3o and the Cape S\u00e3o Vicente\n\ninteract with the Mediterranean Outflow Water forming eddies that characterize the circulation\n\npatterns at the mesoscale (Cherubin et al., 2000). Salinity is fairly constant 35.0\u201336.0 but sea\n\nsurface temperature presents a marked seasonal variation between 14 and 24 ?C depending on\nwhether upwelling or downwelling dominates.\n\nThe western part of the Algarve coast (Barlavento) is generally characterized by rocky form-\n\nations of several types (e.g. underwater spurs, boulders, low relief rocky areas, submerged rock\n\nbottoms), by different sediment dynamics, and also different human activities over the entire area.\n\nThe coastal area near Lagos (see Figure 2.1), in particular, is morphologically complex, presenting\n\nrocky areas with cliffs forming small beaches, a large bay with extensive sandy beaches and dunes,\n\na coastal lagoon (Ria de Alvor) and the Arade and Bensafrim estuaries. The shallow continental\n\nshelf (down to ?30 m depth) is generally characterized by rocky outcrops with pockets of rubble\nand/or sand. In the eastern part of the Algarve coast (Sotavento), rocky bottoms are scarce and\n\nonly two large areas are found, Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril (Figure 2.1). Apart from these\n\ntwo areas, only small rocky reefs can be found scattered over the large, low relief sandy areas.\n\nThree rocky areas in the Algarve were surveyed. The Lagos Bay is located in the western part\n\nof the Algarve that extends from Lagos to Portim\u00e3o and comprises an area with 20.6 km2 of rocky\n\nbottoms and covers ?25 km of the Algarve coast with depth ranging from 0 to 30 m. Pedra da Greta\n\n56\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE\nOF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL\n\nFigure 2.1.: Map of the Algarve with the three study areas: LB - Lagos Bay; PG - Pedra da Greta and PB -\nPedra do Barril.\n\nis a rocky outcrop running parallel to the shoreline at 15\u201318 m depth with ?2 km length, 50\u2013100 m\nwidth and 1\u20133.5 m height. Pedra do Barril is also a rocky outcrop running parallel to the shoreline\n\nat 22\u201327 m depth with ?3 km length, 100\u2013150 m width and 2\u20135 m height. Because the depth range\nof rocky habitats at Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril do not overlap and are more restricted than\n\nthe rocky habitats at Lagos Bay, in the latter location sampling was stratified by dividing the area\n\ninto comparable depth ranges (Lagos shallow, 15\u201320 m; Lagos deep, 20\u201325 m) to enable proper\n\ncomparisons.\n\nSome environmental features of the sampled areas are summarized in Table 2.1. Semi-\n\nquantitative criteria were set for different environmental parameters (complexity, sediment cov-\n\nering the rocky surfaces, intensity and frequency of underwater currents, re-suspension of sed-\n\niments) to characterize the different study locations. The sediment type surrounding each area\n\nwas obtained using sediment classification cartography (Anonymous, 2006a) and the percentage\n\nof fine particles (<63 \u00b5m) in their vicinity was estimated for a circular area of 4 km diameter using\nGIS. Generally, Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril present higher relief and topographic complexity\n\nthan Lagos Bay (Table 2.1). The shallower sites, Lagos shallow and Pedra da Greta, are surrounded\n\nmainly by medium to coarse sandy sediments whereas Lagos deep and Pedra do Barril neighbour\n\nsediment areas characterized by fine particles (<63 \u00b5m). Therefore, re-suspension of sediment\nparticles is more likely to occur at the deeper areas resulting in higher proportions of the substrate\n\ncovered by sediments and lower visibility. In Pedra do Barril, moderate underwater currents re-\n\nsuspending sediment were frequently observed during sampling.\n\n2.2.2. Human impacts potentially affecting gorgonians in South Portugal\n\nIn south Portugal, contamination is largely due to coastal development and industry that\n\n57\n\n\n\nPART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\noperates in the area, being concentrated in urban areas and influenced by freshwater inputs\n\n(Machado et al., 1999; Wayland et al., 2008). Scuba diving has been growing in the past few years\n\nand, generally, the western part of the Algarve (Barlavento) presents higher number of divers, dives\n\nand diving companies than the eastern part (Sotavento) (IPIMAR unpublished data). However,\n\nthe number of visits per site is similar at both areas because there are more rocky areas and\n\nconsequently more diving spots in Barlavento. Moreover, the number of diving companies, divers\n\nand dives (IPIMAR unpublished data) are low when compared to those of other areas with intensive\n\nscuba diving (e.g. Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea) and the estimates of damage inflicted to gorgonians\n\nby scuba divers is low (unpublished data). On the other hand, large storm events are rare, not\n\nlong-lasting, and of similar intensity across the overall coastal area, and mass mortality events,\n\nreported elsewhere (Martin et al., 2002; Linares et al., 2005; Coma et al., 2006; Schiaparelli et al.,\n\n2007; Garrabou et al., 2009), have never been reported for the Algarve. Nevertheless, in years of\n\nlong summer periods of high temperature and calm sea (such as the summers of 2006, 2009, 2010\n\nand 2011, http://www.hidrografico.pt/boias-ondografo.php), there was some evidence of mats\n\ncovering uniformly the sea bottom rapidly disappearing when water temperature drops and sea\n\nroughness increases ( JC, personal observation). Therefore, because of the low intensity of the\n\nprevious potential damaging factors to gorgonians in south Portugal, the most plausible impacts\n\naffecting these assemblages seem to be fishing and anchoring that are known to cause complete\n\nor partial mortality by physical contact (Bavestrello et al., 1997; Eno et al., 2001; Johnson, 2002;\n\nMilazzo et al., 2002). As no spatial data on the distribution of anchoring is available, and there are\n\nno major reasons to suspect that anchoring is higher in any of the areas, we accept the hypothesis\n\nthat this pressure is similar along the coast.\n\nFishing gears such as seize nets, trammel nets, gillnets, longlines and traps are intensively used\n\nby fishermen in the area, being frequently lost along the Algarve coast (Erzini et al., 1997; Santos\n\net al., 2003a,b; Erzini et al., 2008). Due to the scale and importance of commercial fishing in the\n\nAlgarve, this activity arises as the most important and frequent source of damage for gorgonians,\n\neven though very difficult to quantify. It is, however, known that in the Algarve, gorgonians are\n\ncommonly caught accidentally by fishermen while retrieving fishing gears (Nobre, 1931; Gon\u00e7alves\n\net al., 2008; Vieira, 2008).\n\nSome statistics concerning fishing are summarized in Table 2.2, comparing the western (Bar-\n\nlavento; Lagos Bay) and eastern (Sotavento; Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril) parts of the coast.\n\nThe local fleet (vessels with less than 9 m) and the coastal fleet (vessels with more than 9 m) are\n\nallowed to fish in the studied areas in shallow waters (Erzini et al., 1997; Santos et al., 2003a; Erzini\n\net al., 2008). Generally, the number of fishing licenses, number of fishing vessels and captures are\n\nhigher in Sotavento than in Barlavento suggesting a higher fishing effort in the former area. What\n\nis more, the area of rocky bottoms in the Sotavento is much lower than in Barlavento, contributing\n\nto the concentration of fishing, thus increasing fishing pressure.\n\n58\n\nhttp: //www.hidrografico.pt/boias-ondografo.php\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.

INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE\nOF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL\n\nThe information on lost fishing gears by the local fleet operating in shallow waters at both\n\nareas reinforces this idea (Table 2.2). Another indicator that fishing pressure in nearshore waters\n\nis higher in Sotavento is the number of octopus traps used per vessel by the local fleet and the\n\nhigher proportions of lost traps for both fleets. Based on this information and also on surface\n\n(e.g. number of buoys and fishing vessels) and underwater observations by the authors during the\n\nsampling surveys (e.g. lost fishing gears), fishing pressure is higher in Pedra da Greta and Pedra do\n\nBarril (Sotavento) than in Lagos Bay (Barlavento) (Table 2.2).\n\n2.2.3. Distribution of gorgonians at the regional scale of the Algarve\n\nThe distribution of gorgonians was quantified by means of underwater transects by scuba\n\ndiving (5 \u00d7 1 m belt transects). Specifically, 72 transects were conducted at Lagos shallow and 30\ntransects at Lagos deep. A total of 20 transects were conducted in Pedra da Greta and 12 in Pedra\n\ndo Barril. Identification of gorgonian species was based on the studies by Carpine and Grasshoff\n\n(1975), Grasshoff (1988, 1992) and Gonz\u00e1lez (1993). In the Algarve coast, underwater identification\n\nof gorgonians is difficult because of ambiguities in the taxonomy of Eunicella and Leptogorgia, and\n\ntherefore we used a set of criteria defined by C\u00fardia et al. sub.b.\n\nMultivariate methods were used to analyse the gorgonian communities at the studied areas.\n\nNon-metric multidimensional scaling was used to inbestigate differences in the distribution and\n\nabundance patterns of gorgonians across locations using the modified Gower dissimilarity index\n\nwith transformed data (log2 x + 1). The modified Gower index (Anderson et al., 2006) is able to\ndetect changes in composition but has the advantage of being directly interpretable as the average\n\nchange in orders of magnitude (defined by the transformation). By using log2 transformation\n\nthe modified Gower index is weighted towards a compositional change equal to a doubling\n\nin abundance (Anderson et al., 2006). Community composition differences between groups\n\nof samples were assessed using the non parametric multiple response permutation procedure\n\n(MRPP) (Zimmerman et al., 1985; Foster et al., 2009). Indicator species analysis (ISA) was per-\n\nformed to investigate the association of each gorgonian species to the studied areas, with the\n\nindicator species value (Dufr\u00eane and Legendre, 1997) estimated using the index\n?\n\nI nd V al\ng\ni nd\n\n(hereafter designated IndVal) proposed by De C\u00e1ceres et al. (2010). Differences in abundance\n\nbetween groups of samples were tested using the non parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To\n\nquantify the ecological association of gorgonian species, three measures based on presence-\n\nabsence data were used: Ochiai, Dice and Jaccard (Janson and Vegelius, 1981). The three measures\n\nrange from 0 (when the two species being compared do not share any sample) to 1 (when the\n\ntwo species share all the samples). All statistical analyses were conducted using the open source\n\nsoftware R version 12.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010).\n\n61\n\n\n\nPART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\n2.2.4. Size-frequency distribution patterns\n\nThe size-frequency distribution patterns were analysed at the four sampling areas for Eunicella\n\ngazella, Eunicella labiata, Leptogorgia lusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa. These species were\n\nselected because of their frequency of occurrence and abundance, as well as their relevance in\n\ndifferentiating gorgonian assemblages (see Results). For each species, all the colonies observed\n\nalong linear transects were measured in order to prevent duplicates. The scuba diver dived close\n\nto the substratum in order not to miss the smallest colonies. The maximum height of each colony\n\nwas measured to the nearest 0.5 cm and used as size parameter (Linares et al., 2008d).\n\nThe mean height of each species in each site both at shallow and deep sites was compared\n\nusing the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Size- frequency distribution of each gorgonian\n\npopulation was analysed using histograms and kernel density estimation (e.g. Everitt and Hothorn,\n\n2006; Turley and Ford, 2011). The size-frequency distribution curve was analysed in terms of\n\ndescriptive statistics using skewness and kurtosis (Linares et al., 2008d). Skewness (g1) is a measure\n\nof the symmetry of a distribution, being defined as the third moment of the distribution divided by\n\nits standard deviation (Legendre and Legendre, 1998). If skewness is significant, the distribution\n\nis asymmetric. Positive skewness corresponds to a frequency distribution with a longer \u201ctail\u201d to\n\nthe right than to the left (prevalence of small size classes in the population), whereas a distribution\n\nwith a longer \u201ctail\u201d to the left than to the right shows negative skewness (dominance of large size\n\nclasses) (Legendre and Legendre, 1998). Kurtosis (g2) is a measure of the peakedness (or flatness)\n\nof a distribution near its central model, being defined as the fourth moment of the frequency\n\ndistribution. A significant value of kurtosis indicates that the variable has longer tails than those\n\nfor a normal distribution and therefore the prevalence of a particular size class in the population.\n\nSkewness and kurtosis coefficients are significant if g1 per SES (standard error of skewness) or g2\n\nper SEK (standard error of kurtosis) is greater than 2 (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995). All statistical analyses\n\nwere conducted using the open source software R version 12.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010).\n\n2.3. Results\n\nGorgonians were very frequent in the study area being observed in more than 95 % of the\n\ntransects sampled at each area. Eight gorgonian species were identified in the present study but\n\nParamuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis and Eunicella sp. were rare and presented extremely low\n\nabundance (Table 2.3).\n\n2.3.1.

The density of gorgonians was extremely variable but the above\n\nmentioned species commonly presented dense aggregations of conspecifics. Besides, these\n\nspecies were highly associated in the study area as they were commonly observed at the same\n\ntransects Figure 2.2. Within each assemblage, the dominant species presented high similarity\n\nbetween themselves, whereas the less abundant and frequent species presented lower values.\n\nThis pattern was particularly evident in Lagos Bay at both depths, where Leptogorgia lusitanica\n\npresented low abundance (2.4 % and 2.8 % of the total, for shallow and deep sites, respectively)\n\nand was less frequent (present in 22 % and 30 % of the sampled transects, respectively). The same\n\npattern was found for Leptogorgia sarmentosa in Pedra da Greta and for Eunicella verrucosa in\n\n63\n\n\n\nPART I.

The superimposition of total\n\nabundance and number of species data evidenced a gradient from the lower left corner to the\n\nupper right corner of the plot (Figure 2.3, Abundance and Number of Species). The indicator\n\nspecies analysis (ISA) indicated that Eunicella labiata was common and abundant at all sampled\n\nareas (IndVal=0.959) but that Paramuricea clavata was exclusive of Pedra do Barril (IndVal=0.500,\n\np = 0.003). Leptogorgia sarmentosa was mainly associated with deeper sites (Lagos deep and Pedra\n\n64\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE\nOF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL\n\ndo Barril, IndVal=0.816, p = 0.001), whereas two species were more characteristic of the Sotavento\n(Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril), namely Leptogorgia lusitanica (IndVal=0.963, p = 0.001) and\nEunicella gazella (IndVal=0.907, p = 0.001). Eunicella verrucosa was common at Lagos shallow,\nLagos deep and Pedra da Greta (IndVal=0.853, p = 0.001). The ISA results were also reinforced by\nthe patterns evidenced when the abundance data of each gorgonian species was superimposed to\n\nthe nMDS ordination plot (Figure 2.3).\n\nThe multiple response permutation procedures (MRPP) detected differences in the structure\n\nof the assemblages for several sources of variation (Table 2.4). It is noteworthy that multivariate\n\ndispersion was different between the samples of the Barlavento and the samples of Sotavento\n\n(Table 2.4), thus the differences observed with MRPP may be due to differences in dispersion\n\nand not to differences in the structure of the community. The assemblage structure was different\n\nbetween Barlavento and Sotavento, namely because of the significantly higher density of Eunicella\n\ngazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica in Sotavento (Tables 2.3 and 2.4 and Figure 2.3). Depth\n\nalso influenced the structure of gorgonian assemblages, as Eunicella labiata and Leptogorgia\n\nsarmentosa were more frequent and presented higher density at deeper sites. In Barlavento, the\n\noccurrence and density of Eunicella verrucosa was also higher at deeper sites (Tables 2.3 and 2.4).\n\nOn the other hand, in Sotavento the latter species presented lower density at deeper sites and\n\nwas observed only in 25 % of the transects. What is more, Eunicella gazella also presented higher\n\ndensity at deeper sites in Sotavento. Comparing the samples at similar depth ranges at lower depth,\n\nEunicella labiata and Leptogorgia sarmentosa presented lower density in the Sotavento (Pedra\n\nda Greta), with the latter species also showing lower occurrence rates (Table 2.3). In addition to\n\nthe previously mentioned general pattern between Barlavento and Sotavento, the differences in\n\ngorgonian assemblages between Lagos deep and Pedra do Barril were due to Eunicella labiata,\n\nwhich was more abundant in Pedra do Barril, and Eunicella verrucosa, which was rare in this area.\n\n65\n\n\n\nPART I.

GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\n2.3.2. Size-frequency distributions\n\nThe sample size varied between sites depending greatly on the density of each species at each\n\nsite. The height of Eunicella gazella, Leptogorgia lusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa at 15\u201320 m\n\n(shallow sites) was significantly lower in Pedra da Greta, where fishing is more intensive (Table 2.5)\n\nbut the opposite trend was observed concerning Eunicella labiata presenting taller colonies in this\n\nlocation. Concerning the deeper populations, the pattern was different: Eunicella labiata did not\n\npresent significant differences between populations, whereas the populations of the remaining\n\nspecies from the less fished area (Lagos deep) presented a significantly lower height than in Pedra\n\ndo Barril.\n\nThe distributions of Eunicella gazella sizes were positively skewed with the exception of Lagos\n\nshallow which is symmetric. However, only the population of Pedra do Barril presented a distri-\n\nbution that is more peaked than a normal distribution (see Figure 2.4 and Table 2.5). The other\n\nEunicella species presented symmetric distributions at all sampled sites but the distributions in\n\nthe populations of the less fished areas (Lagos Bay) were less peaked than a normal distribution,\n\nas they showed significant negative kurtosis. Similarly to Eunicella gazella, the distribution of\n\nsizes of Leptogorgia lusitanica, except for the population of Lagos shallow, were asymmetric,\n\npresenting significant positive skewness values (deviated towards small sizes). This species\n\npresented negative kurtosis for the population of Lagos shallow, and positive kurtosis for the\n\nremaining populations; yet only the population from Pedra da Greta presented significant kurtosis\n\n(more peaked than a normal distribution; Figure 2.4 and Table 2.5). The populations of Leptogorgia\n\nsarmentosa were symmetric in the less fished areas and asymmetric in the fished areas, where\n\npositively skewed distributions were oberved (towards small sizes). However, only the population\n\nfrom Pedra da Greta presented a significant kurtosis, showing a more peaked distribution (due to\n\nthe high number of small sized colonies&lt;10 cm).\n\nSize-frequency distributions for Leptogorgia lusitanica, Leptogorgia sarmentosa, Eunicella ga-\n\nzella and Eunicella labiata populations at Lagos shallow, Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril were\n\ngenerally unimodal, and more or less bell-shaped (Figure 2.4). However, the four gorgonian species\n\nseem to present a bimodal distribution at Lagos deep with a large contribution of small sizes for\n\nall species (<5 cm for Eunicella gazella;&lt;10 cm for Eunicella labiata, Leptogorgia lusitanica and\nLeptogorgia sarmentosa). At this site, Eunicella labiata is the only species whose population is not\n\nclearly dominated by small sizes, presenting a peak at ?40 cm (the major peak of the distribution).\n\n68\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.

Discussion\n\nThe gorgonian fauna of the southern Portuguese coast is composed by species of different\n\norigins, namely from the Atlantic (Eunicella verrucosa), Mediterranean (Leptogorgia sarmentosa,\n\nEunicella singularis, Paramuricea clavata) and North Africa (Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella),\n\nhighlighting the importance of this geographical area for the fluxes of biological diversity, namely\n\nthose of long lived animals with a relevant role in the benthic ecosystem functioning. The inexist-\n\nence of previous quantitative studies in the study area hampers comparisons and consequently\n\nthe assessment of potential changes in abundance and structure of gorgonian fauna. Some\n\nremarkable differences, however, emerged from the comparison with the Mediterranean area.\n\nWhile the western Mediterranean assemblages are mainly monospecific (Bianchi, 2007; Gori et al.,\n\n2011a), in the Algarve, diversity is higher, similarly to the observed in tropical areas (Lasker and\n\n70\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE\nOF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL\n\nCoffroth, 1983; Yoshioka and Yoshioka, 1989; Chiappone et al., 2003). Besides, in the Mediter-\n\nranean area, species rarely coexist (Gori et al., 2011a), whereas in the south coast of Portugal,\n\nthere is a high association of several gorgonian species that co-dominate the assemblages. The five\n\ndominant species, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella labiata, Eunicella verrucosa, Leptogorgia lusitanica\n\nand Leptogorgia sarmentosa were also found to be abundant and to co-occur in several locations in\n\nthe Albor\u00e1n Sea, near the entrance of the Mediterranean (Oca\u00f1a et al., 2000). Contrastingly, in the\n\nneighbouring western Mediterranean waters, gorgonian assemblages are generally dominated by\n\nParamuricea clavata or Eunicella singularis with Eunicella cavolinii and Leptogorgia sarmentosa\n\nalso being common and abundant (e.g. Coma et al., 2004, 2006; Linares et al., 2008a; Garrabou\n\net al., 2009; Gori et al., 2011a). Except for Leptogorgia sarmentosa, the remaining species are\n\nentirely absent or rare and presenting low abundance in the Algarve, showing once more a\n\nremarkable resemblance to the patterns observed near Gibraltar and the Albor\u00e1n Sea (Gonz\u00e1lez,\n\n1993; Oca\u00f1a et al., 2000). The present results reinforce the importance of areas under the influence\n\nof different water masses and oceanographic curents for marine biodiversity and conservation\n\n(Bianchi, 2007; Carvalho et al., in press).\n\n2.4.1. Observed distribution and ecology of gorgonians\n\nDespite the co-existence of the main species, some spatial differences in the abundance\n\npatterns were observed along the southern coast of Portugal that may be related to different en-\n\nvironmental requirements of the species but also to a higher fishing pressure in the Sotavento. For\n\nexample, Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica were more abundant in fished areas, while\n\nthe abundance of Eunicella labiata and Leptogorgia sarmentosa was greater in less fished areas.\n\nThe abundance of gorgonians increased with depth, in line with reports of other geographical\n\nareas (e.g. Stone, 2006; Linares et al., 2008a; Gori et al., 2011a), but also for the south of Portugal\n\n(C\u00fardia et al., sub.b). Physical complexity of the substrate is very different at the sampled areas,\n\nincreasing from Lagos Bay to Pedra da Greta. At Pedra do Barril, intermediate complexity levels\n\nwere observed, as canyons cutting the rocky formations were less common and less heterogeneous\n\nthan in Pedra da Greta, but rocky formations generally presented higher elevation from the seabed\n\n(3\u20135 m). Contrastingly, turbidity showed the opposite trend being higher at Lagos Bay, probably\n\nbecause of the proximity of the mouth of the Arade and Bensafrim estuaries and the Ria de Alvor\n\ncoastal lagoon. These observations support the distribution pattern of Leptogorgia sarmentosa,\n\nwhich abundance was significantly higher in Lagos Bay than in the other studied areas. This\n\nspecies has been pointed out as indicator of silt (Weinberg, 1978) and characteristic of horizontal or\n\nsloped surfaces where sediment tend to accumulate or even of soft-bottoms (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1993; Gori\n\net al., 2011a); it is also typical of areas of moderate disturbance where sediment re-suspension\n\nis high (Ribes et al., 2003; Rossi et al., 2004; Gori et al., 2011a). The habitat conditions in Lagos\n\nBay clearly favour this species as the area is characterized by low relief rocky plateaus with a thick\n\n71\n\n\n\nPART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nlayer of fine sediment particles that are easily re-suspended (submerged rock bottoms). On the\n\nother hand, the few Leptogorgia sarmentosa observed in Pedra da Greta were found in horizontal\n\nsurfaces of rock with low relief and close to sandy areas (in the reef margins and in sand pockets)\n\nor in isolated rocks between large blocks. The intermediate abundance values found at Pedra do\n\nBarril together with the intermediate values of sediment bed load reinforce the influence of this\n\nenvironmental parameter as a driving force in structuring Leptogorgia sarmentosa assemblages,\n\nwhich is supported by the importance of re-suspended particles in the diet of this species (Ribes\n\net al., 2003; Rossi et al., 2004). Even though the environmental conditions at Lagos Bay seemed\n\nto be highly favourable for Leptogorgia sarmentosa assemblages, its mean abundance at 20\u2013\n\n25 m depth (1.94 colonies m?2) was similar to the maximum density values reported by Gori et al.\n\n(2011a, 1.5 colonies m?2), but much lower than the 17 colonies m?2 found by Weinberg (1978) and\n\nMistri (1995) in other western Mediterranean areas. However, the maintenance of population at\n\nintermediate abundance levels may be a strategy of the species to overcome potential abrasion\n\neffects caused by water movement, as Leptogorgia sarmentosa is characterised by thin and flexible\n\nbranches, and therefore, dense populations are more likely affected by abrasion (Tsounis et al.,\n\n2006).\n\nEcological requirement of the remaining species are still poorly acknowledged. However, it is\n\nknown that, for example, Leptogorgia lusitanica prefers habitats with some hydrodynamics but\n\nclear waters (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1993), which is consistent to the present dataset. In opposition to the\n\nobserved for Leptogorgia sarmentosa, higher densities of Leptogorgia lusitanica were observed\n\nin Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril when compared to Lagos Bay, where turbidity was higher.\n\nOn the other hand, sedimentation and turbidity do not seem to affect the establishment and\n\nsuccession of Eunicella species, particularly Eunicella labiata, which seems to have the ability\n\nto tolerate different levels of sedimentation, generally presenting high abundance and/or being\n\na top ranked species in areas subjected to different levels of sedimentation. Eunicella verrucosa,\n\nalthough distributed along the southern Portuguese coast, was more common and abundant in\n\nLagos Bay and Pedra da Greta than in Pedra do Barril. This distribution pattern may reflect its\n\nhabitat requisites, as this species has been described as relatively sciaphilic, living in hard bottom\n\nhabitats (Carpine and Grasshoff, 1975), sloped rocky blocks and on small rocks and shells in detritic\n\nbottoms (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1993), which were rare in the sites sampled in Pedra do Barril. What is more,\n\nthis species and Leptogorgia sarmentosa have been commonly found in shallow waters in western\n\nMediterranean in areas with increased turbidity (Sartoretto and Francour, 2012).\n\nThe low abundance and frequency of occurrence of Eunicella singularis and Paramuricea\n\nclavata was expected as these are typical Mediterranean species. Paramuricea clavata was only\n\naccounted in Pedra do Barril, especially in vertical walls, but with low abundance (although\n\nnot observed in this study, this species has been also occasionally observed in Pedra da Greta\n\nand in Lagos Bay). These observations are consistent with reports from the Mediterranean,\n\n72\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE\nOF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL\n\nwhere Paramuricea clavata is extremely abundant in vertical walls at similar depths (Linares\n\net al., 2008a; Gori et al., 2011a), reaching densities of 52.5 colonies m2 (Linares et al., 2008d).\n\nParamuricea clavata presents a narrow range of environmental requirements, such as irradiance\n\nand sedimentation (Linares et al., 2008a). The latter factor has been suggested as determinant\n\nfor the variation of its upper limit depth along the Mediterranean Spanish coast, being reported\n\nfrom southern sites at similar depth to Pedra do Barril, around 25\u201330 m depth (Linares et al.,\n\n2008a). In Portuguese waters, this species has been observed outside the study area, in Professor\n\nLuiz Saldanha Marine Park (Arr\u00e1bida, Center of the western Portuguese coast) (Rodrigues, 2008),\n\nIlha das Berlengas (Center/North of the western Portuguese coast) (Rodrigues et al., 2008) where\n\nit is found in large densities in vertical walls ( J G, personal observation) and in the submarine\n\nmountains of the Gorringe Bank (Anonymous, 2006b). Recently, it has been reported that in\n\nsouthern Portugal, Paramuricea clavata dominates the gorgonian assemblage at 59\u2013120 m depth\n\n(Anonymous, 2011). Taking into consideration that the present study accounted for shallow waters\n\nonly, the distribution of Paramuricea clavata in the Algarve may be underestimated, highlighting\n\nthe need for further studies at deeper depths. In the case of Eunicella singularis, which is very\n\nabundant in the Mediterranean (Ballesteros, 2006; Gori et al., 2011a), displaying great plasticity\n\nand amplitude in its environmental preferences (Gori et al., 2011a), its low occurrence and\n\nabundance may be related to the generally lower light intensity of the Algarve mesotrophic waters\n\nwhen compared to the oligotrophic Mediterranean waters. Shallow colonies of Eunicella singularis\n\nhost zooxanthelae and consequently have a marked dependence on light (Previati et al., 2010; Gori\n\net al., 2011b).\n\n2.4.2. Impacts on shallow water gorgonians: anthropogenic versus natural\ndisturbance\n\nIn the study area, fishing and anchoring seem to be the most potentially injurious anthropo-\n\ngenic disturbance events affecting gorgonian assemblages. Besides, based on several statistics,\n\nfishing pressure is higher in the Sotavento than in Barlavento. In situ observations during surveys\n\nsupport this idea, as in areas under higher fishing pressure, gorgonian colonies detached from the\n\nbottom and covered with sediment were frequently observed. Contrary to some gorgonians that\n\nreattach and recover after disturbance events, the recovery of detached gorgonians in the Algarve\n\nseems to be low, similarly to what has been reported from the Mediterranean (Linares et al., 2008d).\n\nDifferences in gorgonian density over the studied areas may be a consequence of the interaction\n\nof both natural and anthropogenic pressures, which is supported by the size-frequency distribu-\n\ntion of the main gorgonian species. Gorgonian populations sampled in more intensively fished\n\nareas generally presented skewed distributions towards small sizes, and more peaked than normal\n\ndistributions suggesting that these populations are affected by disturbance events. However,\n\n73\n\n\n\nPART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nin the studied populations, gorgonians of higher sizes were not restricted to the sites under\n\nlower pressure, as observed for other soft corals where larger sizes are found in more pristine\n\nsites (Linares et al., 2008a, and references therein). The survival of large-sized colonies play an\n\nimportant role in the persistence of gorgonian populations, compensating for poor reproductive\n\nsuccess (Yoshioka, 1998) and, therefore, this item should always integrate management plans.\n\nOn the other hand, the present data showed that all gorgonian populations in Lagos deep\n\npresented bimodal distributions, suggesting a disturbance event that eradicated part of the popu-\n\nlations and/or severely affected recruitment over time. This site was characterized by a thick layer\n\n(1\u20133 cm) of fluidised sediment, which totally covered many small sized gorgonian colonies that\n\npresented retracted polyps. Considering the location and the environmental characteristics of the\n\nsite, the most probable disturbance was high loads of sediments distributed over the seabed, most\n\ncoming from the Arade river, that are easily re-suspended (see Airoldi, 2003, for a review). Data\n\non recruitment, natural mortality and growth rates for the Algarve are completely unavailable,\n\ntherefore it is impossible to ascertain if the disturbance was punctual or repeated in time. These\n\nobservations lead us to hypothesize that disturbance event(s) resulting in a large accumulation\n\nof sediments in shallow rocky bottoms may affect gorgonian populations, namely by affecting\n\nsmall sized specimens and preventing recruitment or at least imposing high mortality of recruits,\n\nproducing gaps in size-frequency distributions. The current results also suggest that spatially\n\nclose areas under similar anthropogenic pressure may present different demographic patterns if\n\nsubjected to different environmental conditions. Indeed, no significant skewness or kurtosis for\n\nthe four studied populations were detected in Lagos shallow, suggesting lower natural disturbance\n\nthan in Lagos deep. This pattern is similar to those of population of Eunicella singularis and\n\nParamuricea clavata from the Mediterranean (Linares et al., 2008a). What is more, at this site the\n\nheight of gorgonians was significantly higher than all (Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica)\n\nor part (Leptogorgia sarmentosa) of the remaining populations. On the other hand, the positive\n\nskewness values found in Pedra da Greta, Pedra do Barril and Lagos deep point towards some\n\ndisturbance, either anthropogenic (fishing/anchoring) or natural (sediment run-off ), which is in\n\nline with the observed in the Mediterranean (Linares et al., 2008a) but not with other studies that\n\nsuggest negative skewness values in disturbed areas (Bak and Meesters, 1998; Meesters et al., 2001).\n\nThe present data suggest that different species respond differently to disturbance: Eunicella\n\nlabiata sizes do not seem to be affected; Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica seem to\n\nbe affected by both kinds of stress; and Leptogorgia sarmentosa seems to be affected mainly by\n\nanthropogenic activities. Direct mortality rates caused by disturbance may often be low and not\n\nclearly depicted by size-frequency distributions. However, disturbance may significantly impact\n\nmarine species by reducing the fitness and alter energy investment of marine animals, being\n\nan important issue in fisheries (Gaspar and Ch\u00edcharo, 2007; Shester and Micheli, 2011). In fact,\n\nconcerning gorgonians, mortality can be increased due to vulnerability to diseases and fouling\n\n74\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2. INDIRECT EVIDENCE OF HUMAN PRESSURE ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND SIZE STRUCTURE\nOF GORGONIAN POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL\n\nand regeneration consumes energy that cannot be directed to reproduction and growth, resulting\n\nin reduced reproductive output, low dispersion and low growth rates (Linares et al., 2008c). Even\n\nthough size-frequency distribution data of Eunicella labiata did not show significant skewness\n\nand kurtosis, it was observed that partial mortality in Eunicella gazella and Eunicella labiata was\n\nhigher in more intensively fished areas than in areas under lower fishing pressure (unpublished\n\ndata). Specifically concerning Eunicella labiata, the most frequent damage involved the complete\n\nbreaking of one of the two main branches of the colony, not severely affecting the size parameter\n\nthat was measured (height), but certainly affecting the biological and ecological aspects of the\n\nspecies. As suggested by Linares et al. (2008a) and the present data, it is important that size-\n\nfrequency distribution data is complemented by damage quantification data in order to properly\n\nassess disturbance effects in gorgonian corals.\n\n2.4.3. Final remarks\n\nThe gorgonian assemblages in shallow rocky areas of the Algarve were found to be more\n\ndiverse than those of the Mediterranean area, with several dominant species coexisting. The\n\nintricate differences in ecological requirements and resilience to disturbance of gorgonian species\n\nshape their populations with important effects in the dynamics and biodiversity of shallow rocky\n\ncommunities. Some studies suggest that communities with more species of ecosystem or habitat\n\nengineers present higher biodiversity and are more resilient (Coleman and Williams, 2002), which\n\nreinforces the relevance of the present study area in the context of NE Atlantic biodiversity.\n\nThe key role of gorgonians for the community of the infra- and circalittoral rock poses another\n\nchallenge, the capacity of these animals to cope with both thermal stress but also pathogens under\n\nclimate change, an important issue in the future management of coastal marine ecosystems. The\n\nhigh abundance of two Eunicella species (Eunicella labiata and Eunicella gazella) characteristic\n\nof the African coast, but that are also present in the Mediterranean (Gonz\u00e1lez, 1993; Oca\u00f1a et al.,\n\n2000), or in the case of Eunicella gazella also in the Northern coast of Spain (Grasshoff, 1992),\n\nmay indicate that these species, original from lower latitudes, are extending their distribution\n\nnorthwards. In Europe, the increasing sea water temperature as a result of climate change\n\nis inducing the spread of numerous tropical marine species (see references in Bianchi, 2007;\n\nPhilippart et al., 2011) presenting new scientific and coastal management challenges (Anna, 2007).\n\nData on genetic diversity on these gorgonian species could prove if these species are recent\n\ncolonizers or if they have established long time ago and have been overlooked due to erroneous\n\nidentifications. Furthermore, climate change has been pointed out as the primary responsible for:\n\ni) benthic fauna mass mortality events in the Mediterranean (Coma et al., 2009; Lejeusne et al.,\n\n2010, and references therein); ii) changes on the reproduction of coastal invertebrates (Lawrence\n\nand Soame, 2004), namely octocorals (Linares et al., 2008c); iii) the increase of pathogenic diseases\n\n75\n\n\n\nPART I. GORGONIAN ASSEMBLAGES IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nin gorgonians (Martin et al., 2002; Bally and Garrabou, 2007); iv) changes on growth rates and\n\npopulation structure of corals (Goffredo et al., 2008); and v) changes in calcification rates of\n\ngorgonians (Ferrier-Pag\u00e8s et al., 2009). Thermotolerance of gorgonians has been observed to be\n\ndepth dependent (Teixid\u00f3 et al., 2011) emphasizing the importance of spatial distribution data in\n\nareas affected by multiple pressures.\n\nIn order to fully understand the factors that might be affecting the distribution of gorgonians\n\nin the Algarve, more studies shall be undertaken, with broader scales and complemented by\n\nenvironmental data and quantitative video-surveys (e.g. on underwater lost fishing gears). As\n\nan example, the use of modern technology such as ROVs has been used to provide solid data\n\nconcerning corals distribution at mid and deeper waters impossible to sample by scuba diving\n\n(e.g. Mortensen and Buhl-Mortensen, 2004; Gori et al., 2011a). Quantitative data on fishing effort\n\nper area, and number of lost fishing gears is also important for a more robust interpretation of\n\nthe direct and indirect effects of fishing in gorgonian populations. As evidenced by this study,\n\ngorgonian size-frequency distributions can be used as proxy for disturbance effects as these slow\n\ngrowing long-lived animals can be used as natural data loggers, registering disturbances along\n\ntime. However, in order to discriminate between natural and anthropogenic disturbances, size-\n\nfrequency data should be complemented by information on secondary colonization and partial\n\nmortality. In this context, the present study provides valuable baseline information that may be\n\nused in future monitoring programs.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nJ.C.

GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\nAbstract\n\nTo date, few studies have examined the relationship between gorgonians and associated non-\n\ncolonial epifaunal assemblages, especially in temperate Atlantic waters. Two species belonging\n\nto two widespread octocoral genera (Leptogorgia and Eunicella) were selected aiming to assess\n\nthe variation in composition and structure of their associated epifaunal assemblages with colony\n\nsize and host species, as well as to analyse the consistency in space and time of these putative\n\npatterns. One hundred and eighty-one species from 11 different phyla (totalling 7284 individuals)\n\nwere identified in 72 replicate colonies. A single colony of Leptogorgia lusitanica, approximately\n\n23 cm width, harboured more than 730 individuals from 63 species. The maximum abundance\n\nin Eunicella gazella (358 individuals) was recorded in a colony of approximately 11 cm width,\n\nwhile the peak of diversity (55 species) was registered in a larger colony of 23.6 cm width. The\n\nepifaunal assemblages of both gorgonian species were numerically dominated by amphipods,\n\nwhereas in terms of diversity, annelids (especially polychaetes) were the richest group in Eunicella\n\ngazella colonies. The RDA analysis indicated a strong relationship of all the size-related attributes\n\n(area, maximum width and height) and Leptogorgia lusitanica epifaunal assemblages, but the\n\n\u201ccolonial\u201d epibiont cover (e.g. macroscopic algae, bryozoans, sponges) was also observed to\n\nbe determinant in structuring the attendant epifaunal assemblages of both gorgonian species.\n\nEpifaunal assemblage structure differed between gorgonian species with a single taxon (Turbel-\n\nlaria) significantly associated with Eunicella gazella colonies and taxa indicated as significantly\n\nassociated with Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies. Although both gorgonians shared most of the\n\nspecies collected, 11 and 18 taxa were exclusively associated with Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica, respectively (without considering singletons). Nevertheless, most of these exclusive\n\ntaxa were either rare or uncommon. The exception was the presence of white flatworms Turbellaria\n\nin Eunicella gazella colonies probably taking advantage of crypsis with the white Eunicella gazella\n\nbranches. The present study supports the general paradigm that corals (generally for scleractinian\n\ncorals) are habitats of enhanced abundance and biodiversity. Gorgonian epifaunal assemblages\n\nnot only showed high values of ?-diversity but intricate patterns of variability in their composition\n\nand structure leading to high ?-diversity. Higher ?-diversity values were consistently detected for\n\nraw than for presence/absence data, suggesting that patterns of biodiversity are more affected\n\nby changes in the relative abundance of dominant species rather than in faunal composition.\n\nAlthough the total pool of species available in gorgonian colonies appears to be the same in both\n\nsites analysed, each colony yields a rather small set of this species pool. All together the colonies\n\nmay act as a metacommunity, but the structure of the assemblage in each colony (e.g. total number\n\nof species, dominance) apparently depends upon host attributes.\n\nKeywords: biodiversity \u2022 ? diversity \u2022 shallow water gorgonians \u2022 Leptogorgia lusitanica \u2022\n\nEunicella gazella \u2022 epibenthic assemblage structure \u2022 northeast Atlantic\n\n90\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF\nATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY\n\n3.1. Introduction\n\nCoral habitats are one of the most diverse marine habitats (Knowlton et al., 2010), probably\n\nas a consequence of the complexity provided by their three-dimensional structure (\u00d6hman and\n\nRajasuriya, 1998; Gratwicke and Speight, 2005b; Idjadi and Edmunds, 2006; Lingo and Szedlmayer,\n\n2006; Wilson et al., 2007) upon which several species depend, especially small invertebrates (Stella\n\net al., 2010; Plaisance et al., 2011). These epifaunal organisms rely on coral colonies for food (e.g.\n\nBurkepile and Hay, 2007; Garc\u00eda-Matucheski and Muniain, 2010) and protection against predators\n\n(e.g. Edwards and Emberton, 1980; Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Bergsma and Martinez, 2011), and may\n\ndisplay several interactions with their hosts, including commensalism (Kumagai, 2008), predation\n\n(Burkepile and Hay, 2007; Schoepf et al., 2010; Garc\u00eda-Matucheski and Muniain, 2010), symbiosis\n\n(Carricart-Ganivet et al., 2004; Stewart et al., 2006; Bergsma, 2010) and mutualism (Holbrook et al.,\n\n2008; Stachowicz and Hay, 1999; Bergsma and Martinez, 2011). Depending on the nature of the\n\ninteraction, coral-associated invertebrates may provide sediment removal (Stewart et al., 2006),\n\nprotection from predators (Pratchett, 2001; Stier et al., 2010), and ultimately contribute to enhance\n\ncoral growth and survival (Bergsma and Martinez, 2011).\n\nStudies on invertebrate species associated to coral reefs are relatively scarce, especially when\n\ncompared to the knowledge on fish-associated assemblages, and most of them have been carried\n\nout in shallow-water Indo-Pacific regions (e.g. Coles, 1980; Edwards and Emberton, 1980; Patton,\n\n1994; Goh et al., 1999; Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Kumagai and Aoki, 2003; Stella et al., 2010). To the\n\nauthors\u2019 best knowledge, to date, only three quantitative studies on non-colonial invertebrate as-\n\nsemblages associated with corals were undertaken in cold-temperate Atlantic waters (Mortensen\n\nand Buhl-Mortensen, 2004; Buhl-Mortensen and Mortensen, 2005; Greene, 2008). However,\n\nresearch on the distribution patterns of coral species and associated fauna is required to better\n\nunderstand their role on coastal ecosystems and to develop sound scientific-based conservation\n\nmeasures aiming to regulate the sustainable use of these areas. Coral habitats considered as\n\npriority by OSPAR include coral gardens, Lophelia pertusa reefs and sea pen fields. Despite being\n\none of the richest ecosystems on the planet, coral reefs are also among the most endangered, by\n\npollution, destructive fishing practices and global climate change (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007;\n\nCarpenter et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2010). As expected, specialist species (those that depend on\n\nonly one or two hosts) will be particularly susceptible to habitat degradation and loss (e.g. Munday,\n\n2004). Therefore, a better understanding of the relationships between corals and associated\n\norganisms, such as small invertebrates, is also crucial for predicting potential biodiversity losses\n\nresulting from coral degradation. Currently, studies on coral-associated fish species revealed that\n\ndeclines in coral abundance resulted in corresponding decreases in fish abundance and diversity,\n\nwith specialist species being more prone to extinction (Jones et al., 2004; Munday, 2004; Pratchett\n\net al., 2011). In this particular, it is noteworthy that marine reserves might help to mitigate the\n\n91\n\n\n\nPART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\nproblem, but will not always be sufficient to reverse this negative pattern (Jones et al., 2004).\n\nIn marine systems, most studies of diversity change across spatial and temporal scales have\n\nbeen focused on local (?-) and regional (?-) diversity, largely neglecting ?-diversity (turnover\n\nor complementarity) (Gray, 2000; Becking et al., 2006). However, more recently, ?-diversity has\n\ngained renewed interest and has been applied to gain further insights on the diversity patterns\n\nand processes underlying species dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales (e.g. Danovaro\n\net al., 2009; Thrush et al., 2010; Dimitriadis and Koutsoubas, 2011; Bevilacqua et al., 2012), and\n\nthus pointed out as a valuable conservation tool (Gering et al., 2003). Facing the need for a\n\nbetter understanding of the relationships between corals and associated epifaunal assemblages,\n\nas well as the scarcity of data concerning cold-temperate octocoral reefs, the present study aims\n\nto describe the patterns of biodiversity, abundance and community structure of the epifaunal\n\nassemblages associated with shallow water gorgonians. The contribution of the inventory (?-\n\ndiversity) and differentiation (?-diversity) components of diversity will be analysed across multiple\n\nscales of variability: host species, colony size, site location and time (inter-annual). The role of\n\ngorgonian gardens in promoting regional (?-) diversity will be discussed. Therefore, in the present\n\nstudy we aim to answer the following questions: 1) will composition and structure of associated\n\nepifaunal assemblage vary with: i) colony size; ii) gorgonian host; 2) are these putative patterns in\n\ncomposition and structure consistent in: i) space; ii) time.\n\n3.2. Materials and Methods\n\n3.2.1. Studied species\n\nThe studied species, Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella gazella, belong to two different\n\ngenera with a worldwide distributional range. Although belonging to the family Gorgoniidae,\n\nLeptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella gazella are morphologically different: Leptogorgia lusitanica\n\ncolonies are generally larger in width than in height, while Eunicella gazella colonies are more\n\nevenly shaped (i.e. display similar width and height). Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies may reach\n\nup to 80 cm in width, while Eunicella gazella is a small-sized species reaching a maximum of 30 cm\n\nin height. Branches of Leptogorgia lusitanica may have different colours and are more flexible,\n\nwhile Eunicella gazella branches are generally thicker and white.\n\n3.2.2. Sampling and laboratory procedures\n\nSampling was undertaken in two consecutive summers (2010 and 2011) at Pedra da Greta\n\n92\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF\nATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY\n\n(PG), the main rocky subtidal area in the central part of the Algarve coast, with approximately\n\n3.6 km in length and ranging from 20 to 90 m in width. In PG, two sites (PG1 and PG2) located at\n\napproximately 15 m depth, were randomly selected to account for spatial variability. The summer\n\nperiod was chosen because it generally corresponds to the peak of invertebrates\u2019 diversity and\n\nabundance in this region.\n\nBecause of the variability in size of Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella gazella, and to assess\n\nthe influence of colony size in the biodiversity patterns, three size classes were previously estab-\n\nlished based on size frequency distributions of the two gorgonian species (C\u00fardia et al., sub.a).\n\nFor Leptogorgia lusitanica the size height ranges were: small,&lt;10 cm; medium, 15\u201325 cm; large,\n>30 cm; whereas for Eunicella gazella the height ranges were: small,&lt;8 cm; medium, 10\u201315 cm;\nlarge, >18 cm. At each site and sampling period, three replicates of each species and colony-\nsize were collected by scuba diving (36 colonies per sampling occasion). The entire colony was\n\nenclosed in a plastic bag to prevent faunal loss and then carefully detached from the substrate. All\n\ngorgonians were transported to the laboratory for further processing.\n\nIn the laboratory, the colonies were preserved in 96 % ethanol. Samples were washed through\n\na 100 \u00b5m mesh sieve and colonies were observed under a magnifying glass to ensure that all\n\nfauna (mobile and sessile epibionts) and flora had been removed. All specimens associated with\n\neach colony were preserved in 96 % ethanol and afterwards identified to the lowest practical\n\ntaxonomic level. To estimate species richness, unidentifiable organisms were, whenever possible,\n\ndifferentiated into different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). If animals were juveniles and/or\n\nwere extremely damaged, and it was impossible to recognize whether they were different entities\n\nor belong to any of the already identified species, they were excluded from the analyses. The\n\nabundance of macroscopic algae, cnidarians, bryozoans, sponges and hydrozoans was estimated\n\nby a semi-quantitative index ranging from 0 to 4, (0 \u2013 absent; 1 \u2013 rare; 2 \u2013 common; 3 \u2013 abundant;\n\n4 \u2013 very abundant). This index will be the sum of the scores of each epibiont observed for each\n\ncolony. In order to minimize bias, scoring was always performed by the same observer and for\n\nsimplicity, this relative index will be hereafter designated as CEC (as for \u201ccolonial\u201d epibiont cover,\n\nwhere the term colonial is used loosely to represent modular organisms). CEC will be used to infer\n\nthe enhancement of functional intricacy of the gorgonian colonies derived from the presence of\n\nattached sessile organisms that may provide additional ecological niches and/or a greater variety\n\nof food resources for the attendant invertebrate assemblages. In the laboratory, the maximum\n\nheight and width and the wet weight of each colony were measured (Table 3.1). Colony surface area\n\nwas estimated using the image analysis software, ImageJ (Rasband, 2010), on digital photographs\n\ntaken in the laboratory.\n\n93\n\n\n\nPART II.

Data analysis\n\nOnly taxa unambiguously assigned to different identities were considered and included in the\n\nanalyses. The number of taxa, Shannon-Wiener diversity (H ?), Pielou evenness index (J ? Pielou,\n1969) and Hurlbert (1971) expected species richness (E S(n)) were calculated and used to describe\n\npatterns in biodiversity and to assess changes in community structure. Hurlbert\u2019s expected\n\nnumber of species, which can be rarefied to the same number of individuals (equal or lower than\n\nthe lowest common number of individuals), is probably the most adequate estimate of biodiversity\n\nfor the present study, because of the implications of size and shape on the total available area\n\nfor colonization of each gorgonian colony. ?-diversity was analysed in terms of complementarity\n\n(differences between colonies of different sizes, different species and different sites), and turnover\n\n(differences between consecutive years). In order to evaluate the level of dissimilarity in species\n\ncomposition and assemblage structure, we calculated the Bray-Curtis coefficients of dissimilarity\n\nbased on the presence/absence and raw data matrices, respectively.\n\nAn analysis of similarities by randomization/permutation tests (ANOSIM) was performed\n\non the samples grouped according to the relevant factors (colony size, host species, site and\n\ntime). Specifically, four tests were undertaken. Test 1 was undertaken for factor \u201ccolony size\u201d\n\n(3 levels: small, medium and large) separately for Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica.\n\nTest 2 was undertaken for factor \u201cgorgonian host\u201d (2 levels: Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica), aiming at assessing differences between sites and sampling years separately. Tests\n\n3 and 4 were carried out for the evaluation of spatial (PG1 vs PG2) and temporal consistency\n\n(2010 vs 2011). Differences in epifaunal assemblage structure between gorgonian hosts, as well\n\nas the relationship between assemblage structure and habitat characteristics, were analysed\n\nby a distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) (McArdle and Anderson, 2001). Size-related\n\nattributes of gorgonian colonies, such as total surface area, maximum width and height were\n\nused as habitat characteristics and CEC was also used as an additional attribute, because of\n\nits recognized role for the occurrence and abundance of mobile invertebrates (Guerra-Garc\u00eda,\n\n2001; Cacabelos et al., 2010). To analyse the contribution of each species to the discrimination\n\nof the epifaunal assemblages associated with both gorgonians, the indicator value (IndVal) was\n\n94\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF\nATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY\n\nused (Dufr\u00eane and Legendre, 1997). Epifaunal species overlap and the existence of potential\n\nhabitat-specialists was also analysed by comparing both datasets with and without singletons (i.e.\n\ntaxon represented by a single organism or found on a single colony). Potential habitat-specialists\n\nare distinguished from rare taxa based on their frequency distribution across replicates of each\n\ngorgonian species (Stella et al., 2010). Indeed, taxa collected from only one of the hosts could\n\neither be: i) rare taxa that have a low rate of occurrence regardless of host; ii) species that do not use\n\ngorgonians as a preferred habitat and therefore are rarely found; or iii) habitat-specialists that only\n\noccur on certain hosts (Stella et al., 2010). Consequently, the occurrence rates were also evaluated\n\nwhen singletons were removed from the dataset (Stella et al., 2010). All statistical analyses were\n\nperformed using the open source software R version 12.1 (R Development Core Team, 2010).\n\n3.4. Results\n\nA total of 181 taxa were identified from the 72 gorgonian colonies (Eunicella gazella \u2013 124\n\ntaxa; Leptogorgia lusitanica \u2013 144 taxa). These taxa were ascribed to 11 phyla, 15 classes, 41\n\norders, 99 families and 150 genera comprising a total of 7284 individuals. Overall, Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica colonies had more taxa and harboured more individuals than those of Eunicella gazella\n\n(Leptogorgia lusitanica \u2013 4382 individuals; Eunicella gazella \u2013 2902 individuals). Regarding the\n\ntaxonomic composition at the highest taxonomic level (phylum), the general pattern was very\n\nsimilar for both gorgonian species. Epifaunal assemblages associated with both gorgonians were\n\nnumerically dominated by arthropods, accounting for up to 48 % and 65 % of total abundance in\n\nEunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively. Molluscs were also abundant in both\n\ngorgonians (18 % in Eunicella gazella and 22 % in Leptogorgia lusitanica) and Platyhelminthes,\n\nwhich were exclusive of Eunicella gazella epifaunal assemblages, were the second most abundant\n\ngroup in this species. In terms of richness (i.e. the number of different OTUs), annelids (and\n\nespecially polychaetes) were highly diverse (over 33 % of total species on both gorgonians).\n\n3.4.1. Biodiversity patterns\n\nThe abundance (i.e. the number of individuals per colony) varied from 6 to 358 in Eunicella\n\ngazella and from 8 to 737 in Leptogorgia lusitanica. In 2010, the mean abundance of epifauna\n\nwas higher in Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies (154.4\u00b142.5 individuals) than in Eunicella gazella\ncolonies (62.3\u00b116.3 individuals), whereas in 2011 values were slightly higher in Eunicella gazella\n(98.9\u00b119.2 individuals) than in Leptogorgia lusitanica (89.1\u00b125.8 individuals) (Figure 3.1). The\nnumber of taxa per colony varied between 4 and 55 in Eunicella gazella, ranging form 5 to 63\n\nin Leptogorgia lusitanica. Mean species richness per colony was consistently lower in Eunicella\n\n95\n\n\n\nPART II.

Effect of colony size\n\nHurlbert\u2019s E S(100) values ranged in Eunicella gazella from 19.8 (small-sized colonies in PG2)\n\nto 34.6 (large-sized colonies in PG2), while in Leptogorgia lusitanica values ranged from 18.4\n\n(small-sized colonies in PG2) to 34.5 (medium-sized colonies in PG2) (Table 3.2).

DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF\nATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY\n\nwas a steady increase in the number of species with colony size, in Leptogorgia lusitanica this\n\nincrease was abrupt from small to medium-sized colonies (Table 3.2). In both hosts, the number\n\nof individuals per colony was also lower in small than medium to large-sized colonies, but there\n\nwas no clear pattern for J ?. Large colonies of Eunicella gazella and medium colonies of Leptogorgia\nlusitanica (both in PG2) had the highest E S(100) and J\n\n? values and offered more redundancy to the\noverall biodiversity in terms of expected number of species (Figure 3.2 and Table 3.2). However,\n\nthere was always some degree of complementarity in the assemblages of different colonies, as the\n\npooled number of species for each colony size was always much lower than the grand total for each\n\nhost species (Table 3.2). Although different in terms of species composition, small-sized colonies\n\ngenerally showed more similar values of N, S and E S(100) between gorgonian species than larger\n\ncolonies (Table 3.2). The main differences for each gorgonian host were found between small\n\ncolonies and the remaining size classes. ANOSIM analysis confirmed this trend, indicating that\n\ncommunity structure and composition were significant different between small- and medium- to\n\nlarge-sized colonies but not between medium and large colonies (Table 3.3, Test 1).\n\nTable 3.2.: Abundance and biodiversity data for Eunicella gazella (EG) and Leptogorgia lusitanica (LL) per\ncolony size class (S - small; M - medium and L - large), site (PG1 and PG2) and year (2010 and\n2011). n - number of colonies; N - number of individuals per colony; S - number of taxa per\ncolony; E S(100) - Hurlbert\u2019s expected number of species per 100 individuals; H\n\n? - Shannon-Wiener\ndiversity; J ? - Pielou\u2019s evenness.\n\nn N S E S(100) H\n?\nloge\n\nJ ? n N S E S(100) H ?loge\nJ ?\n\nEG S PG1 6 244 31 20.14 2.39 0.695 LL S PG1 6 261 35 23.57 2.76 0.776\nEG S PG2 6 243 29 19.78 2.22 0.659 LL S PG2 6 291 28 18.40 2.48 0.744\n\nEG M PG1 6 299 35 22.88 2.47 0.695 LL M PG1 6 1151 80 27.89 3.09 0.705\nEG M PG2 6 1058 64 23.23 2.61 0.628 LL M PG2 6 516 74 34.48 3.33 0.774\nEG L PG1 6 561 60 25.00 2.57 0.627 LL L PG1 6 938 84 30.48 3.20 0.721\nEG L PG2 6 497 74 34.57 3.17 0.737 LL L PG2 6 1225 73 21.22 2.30 0.535\n\nEG S 12 487 45 21.18 2.46 0.647 LL S 12 552 47 22.37 2.83 0.735\nEG M 12 1357 74 24.17 2.71 0.629 LL M 12 1667 105 32.50 3.35 0.719\nEG L 12 1058 99 32.11 3.03 0.659 LL L 12 2163 105 26.97 2.93 0.629\n\nEG PG1 18 1104 77 24.84 2.66 0.613 LL PG1 18 2350 120 31.34 3.32 0.694\nEG PG2 18 1798 102 28.98 2.94 0.636 LL PG2 18 2032 105 26.37 2.81 0.604\n\nEG 2010 18 1122 67 24.22 2.79 0.665 LL 2010 18 2779 102 26.46 2.95 0.637\nEG 2011 18 1780 99 27.48 2.76 0.602 LL 2011 18 1603 106 31.81 3.29 0.706\n\nEG 36 2902 124 28.23 2.92 0.606 LL 36 4382 144 30.51 3.29 0.661\n\nEG+LL 2010 36 3901 123 27.52 3.12 0.648 EG+LL PG1 36 3454 140 30.95 3.33 0.673\nEG+LL 2011 36 3383 139 31.39 3.20 0.649 EG+LL PG2 36 3830 143 29.74 3.15 0.634\n\nTotal 72 7284 181 31.41 3.36 0.646\n\n97\n\n\n\nPART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\n3.4.3. Effect of gorgonian host\n\nThe epifaunal assemblage associated with Eunicella gazella usually showed much lower abund-\n\nance than in the one associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica and often slightly lower values of\n\nthe biodiversity indices both of ?-diversity (S, E S100, H\n?; Table 3.2) and ?-diversity (average\n\ndissimilarity between colonies; Figure 3.3 B1, B2, C1 and C2). The variation in abundance\n\nand specific composition, leading to the differences observed in the community structure, can\n\nbe illustrated by J ? values; in general, evenness was higher in Leptogorgia lusitanica than in\nEunicella gazella (Table 3.2). The higher dominance of the epifaunal assemblages associated\n\nwith Eunicella gazella was also confirmed by the cumulative percentage of abundance of the\n\nthree most abundant taxa (Table 3.4). Despite some rank shifts, in Eunicella gazella the same\n\nthree taxa, Erichthonius punctatus, an undetermined species of Turbellaria and Ostracoda, shared\n\nconsistently more than 50 % dominance irrespective to size, site or year, while in Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica the first three ranks of dominance, accounting for 35 to 54 % dominance were shared by\n\nfive different taxa (four amphipod species and Ostracoda), depending on colony size, site and year\n\n(Table 3.4). Differences between the assemblages associated with the two gorgonian hosts were\n\nalways significant irrespective to site or year (ANOSIM Test 2, Table 3.3). The complementarity of\n\nthe assemblages from Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica is shown by the comparison of\n\nthe rarefaction curves for each gorgonian species and \u201cTotal\u201d in Figure 3.2, but also by the high\n\nmedian dissimilarity between colonies when the estimates include comparisons between both\n\nhosts (Figure 3.3 A1 and A2).\n\nOf the 181 OTUs identified, 48.1 % (87 species) were common to both gorgonian hosts, whereas\n\n37 species (20.4 %) were exclusively found in Eunicella gazella colonies and 57 species (31.5 %)\n\nonly occurred in Leptogorgia lusitanica. However, among those exclusive taxa, there were several\n\nsingletons. Removing singletons from the analysis, the percentage of exclusive taxa dropped to\n\na total of 16 % (corresponding to 29 taxa, 11 exclusive of Eunicella gazella and 18 exclusive of\n\nLeptogorgia lusitanica, Table 3.5). From these taxa, only the undetermined species of Turbellaria\n\nwas frequent and abundant in Eunicella gazella colonies. Only five other taxa occurred in more\n\nthan 10 % of the colonies, namely the bivalve Glans sp. in Eunicella gazella and Ophiuridae\n\nsp.B, and the polychaetes Lumbrineris tetraura, Serpula vermicularis and Syllis cf. columbretensis\n\nin Leptogorgia lusitanica (Table 3.5). The remaining taxa displayed either low abundance or\n\nfrequency of occurrence (Table 3.5).\n\n98\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.

DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF\nATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY\n\nThe dbRDA indicated that the first two ordination axes explain 84 % of the fitted variation\n\n(explained size-related attributes and CEC) comprising about 16 % of the total variation. The\n\nordination plot also revealed a general separation of the epifaunal assemblages associated with the\n\ntwo gorgonian species (along the YY axis, CAP2). The length of the vectors also indicates that size-\n\nrelated attributes of the hosts were relevant for this discrimination. The Turbellaria undetermined\n\nspecies (absent from Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies) was responsible for the separation between\n\ngorgonian species, while the remaining taxa were much more abundant in Leptogorgia lusitanica\n\ncolonies (Figure 3.4). Indeed, the IndVal identified Turbellaria as the only taxon with a significant\n\nassociation with Eunicella gazella (IndVal = 0.986, p &lt;0.001). On the other hand, the molluscs\nSimnia spelta (IndVal = 0.850, p &lt;0.001) and Tritonia sp. (IndVal = 0.757, p &lt;0.01), the crustaceans\nAstacilla sp. (IndVal = 0.773, p &lt;0.001), Caprella fretensis (IndVal = 0.723, p &lt;0.001), Janira\nmaculosa (IndVal = 0.590, p &lt;0.01) and Stenothoe cf. cavimana (IndVal = 0.543, p &lt;0.05), as well\nas the anemone Corynactis viridis (IndVal = 0.657, p &lt;0.01) were all significantly associated with\nLeptogorgia lusitanica.\n\n3.4.4. Spatial and temporal patterns\n\nDespite all the variability found in the attendant assemblages depending on gorgonian colony\n\nsize or host species, these effects do not translate into a significant spatial effect between sites\n\n(ANOSIM Test 3, Table 3.3).\n\nDifferences in the attendant epifaunal assemblages between years were always highly signific-\n\nant either considering each species separately or both species together (ANOSIM Test 4, Table 3.3).\n\nIn opposition to the observations related to location, there was a change in the total pool of species\n\nof the two consecutive years. Turnover was always above 60 % (either considering each species\n\nseparately or both species together) and resulted mostly from replacement of rare species but\n\nalso from changes in the dominant species, especially in the epifaunal assemblage of Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica (Table 3.4). An increase in ?-diversity (S, E S(100)) was also observed in 2011, but although\n\nthe highest increase in number of species was observed in Eunicella gazella it was the increase in\n\nevenness of the Leptogorgia lusitanica assemblages (accompanied by a decrease in abundance)\n\nthat contributed the most to the higher values of E S(100) in 2011 (Table 3.2 and Figure 3.2). In\n\nfact, the rarefaction curves for LL2011, EG+LL2011 and Total (Figure 3.2 D) show almost complete\n\noverlap. On the other hand, in general, ?-diversity was lower in 2011 (Figure 3.3), with the decrease\n\nin median dissimilarity more accentuated in the Eunicella gazella assemblage (Figure 3.3 C1 and\n\nC2).\n\n101\n\n\n\nPART II.

Discussion\n\nEpifaunal assemblages associated with the gorgonians Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella\n\ngazella from shallow North Atlantic waters were rich (181 taxa) and abundant (7284 individuals).\n\nEleven phyla were identified in the branches and upper basis of just two gorgonian species (36\n\ncolonies each). From the literature available (Table 3.6), values observed in the current study are\n\ncomparable to the ones reported by Stella et al. (2010) within the branches of four scleractinian\n\ncorals (12 phyla, 178 nominal species) in the Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia), and\n\nmuch larger than those found by Goh et al. (1999) and Kumagai and Aoki (2003) in shallow water\n\ngorgonians\u2019 from Singapore (seven phyla) and Japan (five phyla), respectively (Table 3.6). A single\n\ngorgonian colony of Leptogorgia lusitanica, approximately 23 cm width, harboured more than 730\n\nindividuals from 63 species. The maximum abundance in Eunicella gazella (358 individuals) was\n\nrecorded in a colony of approximately 11 cm width, while the peak of diversity (55 species) was\n\nregistered in a larger colony measuring 23.6 cm width. Overall, the abundance values observed\n\n105\n\n\n\nPART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\nin the present study are almost three times the values reported by Stella et al. (2010), although\n\nmesh-sieves are not comparable. It is expected that using a sieve with a larger mesh, abundance\n\nwould be lower, but this was not observed in faunal assemblages associated with Leptogorgia hebes,\n\nLeptogorgia virgulata, and Titanideum frauenfeldii in shallow Atlantic waters from the coast of\n\nGeorgia (Greene, 2008). In that study, 15 gorgonian colonies harboured over 56 000 individuals\n\nfrom 11 phyla (Table 3.6). Therefore, it is evident that shallow cold-temperate water gorgonians\n\nare relevant for the enhancement of local diversity and abundance of invertebrates, reinforcing\n\nthe need for their conservation. Amongst the few quantitative studies on the relationship between\n\ncoral reef communities and associated-invertebrates, Idjadi and Edmunds (2006) found that in the\n\nCaribbean reefs, scleractinian traits (namely, coral diversity, percentage cover of live coral, and\n\nthe topographic complexity created by coral skeletons) were positively related with the diversity\n\nof reef-associated invertebrates. Besides, the enhancement of biodiversity is not restricted to the\n\ncoral skeleton area, as it may be extended to the surrounding sediments (Cerrano et al., 2009).\n\nThe epifaunal assemblages of both gorgonian species were numerically dominated by arth-\n\nropods, whereas in terms of diversity, annelids (especially polychaetes) were the richest group\n\nin Eunicella gazella colonies. Among arthropods, amphipods were the dominant taxa in both\n\ngorgonians contributing for a considerable proportion of total epifauna (37 % for Eunicella gazella\n\nand 46 % for Leptogorgia lusitanica). The dominance of amphipod species among crustacean\n\nfauna associated with gorgonians had also been reported for shallow (Greene, 2008) and deep\n\n(Mortensen and Buhl-Mortensen, 2004) Atlantic waters, as well as for shallow waters from the\n\nIndo-Pacific region (Goh et al., 1999; Kumagai and Aoki, 2003). In general, the composition\n\nof amphipod fauna was very similar (especially at family and genus level) to the reported for\n\nother Atlantic areas (Mortensen and Buhl-Mortensen, 2004; Greene, 2008), with the dominance\n\nof Caprellidae (Caprella), Ischyroceridae (Erichthonius, Ischyrocerus and Jassa), Photidae (Gam-\n\nmaropsis and Photis) and Stenothoidae (Stenothoe, in the present study; Metopa in deep-water\n\ngorgonians). The specimens of the genus Caprella, Stenothoe, Erichthonius and Jassa were also\n\namong the dominant fauna of artificial reefs in the Algarve region (Moura et al., 2007, 2008). On\n\nthe other hand, the dominance of the genus Caprella in association with gorgonians had also been\n\nreported for Indo-Pacific shallow waters (Kumagai and Aoki, 2003), where gorgonian mortality has\n\nbeen reported related to a massive attack by caprellids (Metaprotella sandalensis) (Scinto et al.,\n\n2008).\n\nAlthough considerably abundant among scleractinian coral hosts (e.g. Stella et al., 2010), am-\n\nphipods are not dominant, being replaced by decapods (Table 3.6). Therefore, a consistent trend\n\nseems to emerge from the compilation of these studies indicating a dominance of amphipods\n\namong octocorals, whereas decapods dominate among hexacoral hosts (Table 3.6). Further\n\ninvestigation is, however, needed to confirm this trend, as studies are still scarce and differed\n\non sampling procedures. A probable reason for this pattern is the higher availability of refuges\n\n106\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF\nATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY\n\nprovided by sceleractian corals when compared to gorgonians, as it is known that crabs benefit\n\nfrom their association with corals by gaining refuge from predators (e.g. Stachowicz and Hay, 1999;\n\nVytopil and Willis, 2001). This supports the earlier findings of Edwards and Emberton (1980) that\n\nreported the negative correlation between increased branching openness and decreased numbers\n\nof decapods in epifaunal assemblages associated with Stylophora pistillata (scleractinian), while\n\nVytopil and Willis (2001) also suggested that branch tightness contributes to the protection of\n\nassociated epifauna. The diversity of annelids assemblage associated with both gorgonians is by far\n\nhigher than the reported by Goh et al. (1999) for shallow gorgonians from Singapore. On the other\n\nhand, based on studies performed for other coral groups, it seems that diversity of polychaetes is\n\nprobably higher within gorgonians than among scleractinian species (e.g. Stella et al., 2010). Once\n\nmore this needs confirmation as it can result from sampling bias.\n\n3.5.1. Host attributes and associated biodiversity patterns\n\nNon-colonial invertebrates were observed in all colonies sampled and, in general, Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica harboured richer and more abundant assemblages, which can be at least partially\n\nexplained by the resulting greater colonisable area of their colonies. Based on our results,\n\ncolony size and time rather than location were the main drivers of variability in the attendant\n\nassemblages of the two gorgonian species. Increasing colony size translates directly into an\n\nincreasing colonisable area, and, consequently, into a species-area effect, while inter-annual\n\ndifferences may reflect the dynamics of species life cycles (e.g. availability of recruits, success of\n\nrecruitment), the response of individual species to environmental variability and at least partially\n\na random drift in the composition of the assemblages from one year to another.\n\n107\n\n\n\nPART II.

DIVING INTO SHALLOW-TEMPERATE GORGONIAN GARDENS: BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS OF\nATTENDANT EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF VARIABILITY\n\nAlthough live surface area of corals was found to have no correlation either with abundance\n\nor species richness in Acropora colonies (Vytopil and Willis, 2001), the dbRDA analysis indicated\n\nstrong relationships of size-related attributes (surface area, maximum width and height) and\n\nLeptogorgia lusitanica epifaunal assemblages. For both gorgonian species, small-sized colonies\n\ncontributed the least for the overall biodiversity and showed significantly different epifaunal\n\nassemblages compared to medium- and large-sized colonies, confirming the relevance of colony\n\nsize to biodiversity patterns in gorgonian gardens.\n\nThe colonial epibiont cover (e.g. macroscopic algae, sponges, bryozoans) was also observed to\n\nbe determinant in structuring epifaunal assemblages of both gorgonian species. It is known that\n\nsome of the dominant epifaunal taxa, such as caprellid amphipods, may also be closely associated\n\nwith some of these colonial epizoans (e.g. briozoans, hydroids) (Aoki and Kikuchi, 1990; Guerra-\n\nGarc\u00eda, 2001). Therefore, it is difficult to discern whether their abundance is due to the gorgonian\n\nitself or to the associated colonial organisms. The results of the dbRDA analysis supported the\n\nexistence of a different structure in the epifaunal assemblage of the two gorgonian species. A single\n\ntaxon (Turbellaria) was significantly associated with Eunicella gazella colonies, clearly resulting\n\nfrom its exclusivity to this host and its abundance and frequency of occurrence. On the other hand,\n\nseven taxa, although not exclusive, were indicated as significantly associated with Leptogorgia lusi-\n\ntanica colonies. These taxa were two gastropods (Simnia spelta and Tritonia sp.), four crustaceans\n\n(Astacilla sp., Caprella fretensis, Janira maculosa and Stenothoe cf. cavimana), and one cnidarian\n\nCorynactis viridis. Simnia spelta, Tritonia sp. and Corynactis viridis had already been reported\n\nas associated with gorgonians (Patton, 1972; Goh et al., 1999; Rodrigues, 2008; Garc\u00eda-Matucheski\n\nand Muniain, 2010). Although both gorgonians shared most of the species collected, 11 and 18 taxa\n\nwere exclusively associated with Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively (without\n\nconsidering singletons), supporting the existence of specificity of some taxa probably because\n\nof morphological differences between gorgonian species. Nevertheless, most of these exclusive\n\ntaxa presented either low abundance or low frequency. The exception was one undetermined\n\nspecies of Turbellaria occurring in Eunicella gazella colonies. These white flatworms, which colour\n\nresembles the colour of Eunicella gazella branches, may take advantage of crypsis (Goh et al.,\n\n1999). We hypothesize that this specificity may reflect a strategy to avoid predation. Besides\n\nTurbellaria, only six amongst the exclusive taxa observed in each species showed a frequency of\n\noccurrence over 10 %: the bivalve Glans sp. in Eunicella gazella; the polychaetes Lumbrineris\n\ntetraura, Serpula vermicularis and Syllis cf. columbretensis and Ophiuridae sp.B in Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica. Serpula vermicularis was already found within dead coral colonies and rocky substrates\n\nin deep Mediterranean waters (Mastrototaro et al., 2010), while Lumbrineris tetraura has been\n\nassociated with soft (Bone and Klein, 2000) and hard (Giangrande et al., 2003) bottoms, as well as\n\nwithin seagrass meadows (Gambi et al., 1998). Serpula vermicularis has been frequently observed\n\nin hard bottoms from southern Portugal, particularly in artificial reefs (Moura et al., 2007, 2008),\n\nwhere L. tetraura and Syllis cf. columbretensis can also be less frequently found and presenting low\n\n109\n\n\n\nPART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\nabundance (unpubl. data). On the other hand, the bivalves from genus Glans had been identified\n\nfrom fishing trawling samples in the study area (Malaquias et al., 2006). Therefore, these taxa\n\ncannot be considered gorgonian-obligate.\n\nCurrently, over 860 invertebrate species were described as being associated with coral species;\n\nat least half of them appear to have an obligate dependence on live corals and several species show\n\na high degree of preference for one or two coral species (see Stella et al., 2010, for a review). Further\n\nresearch is needed, as these obligate associations and habitat specialization may contribute to a\n\ngreater risk of extinction of associated invertebrates, especially taking into account the current\n\nscenario of ongoing degradation of coral habitats (Stella et al., 2010). Disregarding the level\n\nof dependence on the coral host, all taxonomic components symbiotic assemblages should be\n\nconsidered, as all have the capacity to contribute to the functioning of coral habitats (Gates and\n\nAinsworth, 2011).\n\n3.5.2. Biodiversity patterns: implications for future studies\n\nOverall, the gorgonian species analysed in the present study appear to conform to the general\n\nparadigm that corals (generally for scleractinian corals) are habitats of enhanced abundance\n\nand biodiversity. Therefore, gorgonians, as foundation species (Roff and Zacharias, 2011) in the\n\nmarine environment, promote the existence of a wide diversity of species which may reflect the\n\nmultiple microhabitats available within each colony (Buhl-Mortensen and Mortensen, 2005). Our\n\nresults show not only the high values of ?-diversity in the epifaunal assemblages associated with\n\nthe gorgonian hosts but also intricate patterns of variability in the composition and structure\n\nof these assemblages leading to high values of ?-diversity. The analysis of ?-diversity showed\n\nthe complementarity between individual colonies of different sizes and between colonies of\n\ndifferent host species as well as an important inter-annual turnover in the attendant assemblages.\n\nEach individual colony encloses a small and highly variable subset of the total pool of species.\n\nThe aggregation of colonies facilitates a metacommunity dynamics for which random drift of\n\nindividuals between colonies may have a strong contribution and explains the lack of significant\n\nspatial variation at the local level. In a metacommunity dynamic resulting from ecological\n\nconnectivity (Leibold et al., 2004), patterns of biodiversity are more affected by changes in the\n\nrelative abundance of dominant species rather than in faunal composition. On the other hand,\n\nsome characteristics of the attendant assemblages appear to be driven or at least affected by\n\nthe attributes of their hosts. The host species may be relevant in attracting preferentially some\n\nattendant species and somehow also determine dominance patterns while colony size has a\n\nsignificant effect on the abundance and number of species of the attendant assemblage. Also,\n\na high turnover in these epifaunal assemblages was observed and we hypothesize that this\n\ntemporal fluidity in composition and structure are related to multiple factors including not only a\n\n110\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.

Final remarks\n\nBesides being scarce, studies on the coral-associated epifaunal assemblages do not usually\n\nassess the ?-diversity component and, consequently, are of limited use for comparisons with the\n\npresent study. Our observations have important implications for the design of future biodiversity\n\nassessment studies, highlighting the need to take into account not only ?- but also ?-diversity\n\n(both complementarity and turnover) for an accurate perception of the habitat and its dynamics.\n\nMore than focusing on a single gorgonian species, conservation efforts should be placed on the\n\nwhole habitat encompassing different hosts and the size structure of their populations. Our\n\nfindings support the recent proposal of \u201ccoral gardens\u201d in south Portugal and Spain for the OSPAR\n\nlist of protected habitats (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-\n\nEast Atlantic) (Anonymous, 2011).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nS.C.

GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\nAbstract\n\nCoral reefs and aggregations are generally recognized among the richest marine habitats but,\n\nthere are only a few quantitative studies describing the relationships between corals\u2019 attributes\n\nand their associated epifaunal assemblages. The present study constitutes the first attempt to\n\nexplicitly quantify the link between gorgonians (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) and the abundance and\n\nspecies richness of associated non-colonial epifaunal invertebrates. These community descriptors\n\nshowed a significant correlation to the measured colony attributes of the gorgonians Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica and Eunicella gazella, namely the surface available for colonization (colony height,\n\nwidth and area), complexity and heterogeneity (fractal dimension and lacunarity respectively)\n\nand \u201ccolonial\u201d epibiont cover (colonial fauna and macroscopic algae). The results highlight\n\nthe variation in epifaunal assemblage response to gorgonian colony characteristics, even when\n\nthese are closely related and share similar evolutive histories, like in the present case. The\n\nnature and intensity of the relationships were not only gorgonian species-dependent but varied\n\nfrom one taxonomic group to another. In all faunal groups associated with the two gorgonian\n\nspecies analysed, the species richness and abundance were strongly correlated with \u201ccolonial\u201d\n\nepibiont cover. In fact, colonial epibiont cover possibly due to a trophic effect (direct or indirect\n\nenhancement of food availability) combined with the surface available for colonization (species-\n\narea effect) were the strongest predictors of species richness and abundance. On the other hand,\n\nalthough structural complexity is usually indicated as the main driver for the rich and abundant\n\ncoral-associated assemblages, fractal dimension and heterogeneity were only relevant for the\n\nassemblages associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica. The validity of the paradigm that structural\n\ncomplexity enhances biodiversity may be scale-dependent. In the case of gorgonians, the effect\n\nof complexity at the \u201cgarden\u201d level may be much more relevant than at the individual colony level\n\nreinforcing the need for the conservation of gorgonian aggregation areas as a whole in order to\n\npreserve host diversity and size structure.\n\nKeywords: gorgonians \u2022 invertebrate biodiversity \u2022 structural complexity \u2022 fractal dimen-\n\nsion \u2022 lacunarity \u2022 multiple regression\n\n4.1. Introduction\n\nA likely mechanism by which marine habitats might influence associated animal assemblages\n\nis through provision of complex habitats; in general structurally complex marine habitats (e.g.\n\nsponge and octocoral aggregations, coral reefs) support a greater number of species than simple\n\nones (e.g. Gratwicke and Speight, 2005b). A wider range of niche availability (Attrill et al.,\n\n120\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF INVERTEBRATE EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH\nGORGONIANS ARE DRIVEN BY COLONY ATTRIBUTES\n\n1996; Kovalenko et al., 2012), refuge against predators (Jordan et al., 1996; Vytopil and Willis,\n\n2001; Gratwicke and Speight, 2005a; Lingo and Szedlmayer, 2006) and increased availability of\n\ncolonizable surface translated in a species-area relationship (Dean and Connell, 1987; Attrill et al.,\n\n2000, but see Matias et al., 2010) have been suggested as potential explanations for the higher\n\nbiodiversity of complex systems. Testing the role of habitat complexity rigorously is difficult\n\nbecause of the lack of a widely accepted and objective measure of habitat complexity (Parker\n\net al., 2001) but several proxies have been applied to coral reef areas: surface topography of the\n\nbottom (\u00d6hman and Rajasuriya, 1998), visual estimation of habitat topography (encompassing\n\nreef topography, reef height, rugosity and number of refuge cavities; Wilson et al. 2007), cover of\n\nbranching coral colonies (Chabanet et al., 1997), acoustic roughness (Bejarano et al., 2011), habitat\n\nassessment score (integrating rugosity, variety of growth forms, height, refuge size categories,\n\npercentage live cover and percentage hard substratum; Gratwicke and Speight 2005b), and fractal\n\ndimension (Bradbury and Reichelt, 1983; Knudby and LeDrew, 2007; Zawada et al., 2010). At the\n\nscale of the individual colony, fractal dimension has also been applied to quantify coral shape\n\n(Martin-Garin et al., 2007), morphological variability (Kruszyn?ski et al., 2007) or even for modelling\n\ncoral growth (Merks et al., 2003). Measurement of fractal dimension (D ) allows obtaining a formal\n\nestimate of a habitat\u2019s physical complexity regardless the specific structural components (Beck,\n\n2000).\n\nThe biodiversity of coral habitats is dominated by invertebrates that rely on corals for food,\n\nshelter or settlement cues (see Stella et al., 2011, for a review). Because of their mainly sedentary\n\nbehaviour or reduced mobility, small invertebrates are expected to have stronger relationships\n\nwith habitat characteristics (shape, niche availability, complexity) than fish and, consequently, are\n\npotentially more susceptible to habitat change (Stella et al., 2010). The role of coral host attributes\n\nin structuring associated invertebrates\u2019 assemblages have been assessed for the hexacorals Pocil-\n\nlopora and Acropora (Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Stella et al., 2010, and references therein) but not\n\nfor octocoral species, such as gorgonians. Although most studies indicate a relationship between\n\nepifaunal abundance and species richness and the habitat structure of coral colonies (Abele and\n\nPatton, 1976; Coles, 1980; Julian Caley et al., 2001; Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Stella et al., 2010)\n\nresults were not consistent. Although a few studies focusing on invertebrate fauna associated with\n\ngorgonians (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) were already undertaken, little information is available,\n\nespecially in shallow temperate Atlantic waters, about the actual contribution of gorgonians to\n\nlocal biodiversity, and in what extent gorgonian attributes affects this relationship. As other corals,\n\ngorgonians have been pointed out as foundational species in the sense that they maintain a high\n\nbiodiversity of their attendant assemblages both at the aggregation and at the individual colony\n\nlevels, namely by providing a great variety of niches, ranging from sheltered cavities to high water-\n\nflow areas with little sedimentation (Buhl-Mortensen and Mortensen, 2005).\n\n\u201cCoral gardens\u201d (mainly gorgonian aggregations) are frequent in NE Atlantic and Mediter-\n\n121\n\n\n\nPART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\nranean Sea (Gori et al., 2011a) and were recently proposed for the OSPAR (Convention for the\n\nProtection of the marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) list of protected habitats (An-\n\nonymous, 2011), because of their vulnerability and high conservation value. In a previous study\n\nwe demonstrated the high biodiversity associated with gorgonian gardens in the south of Portugal\n\n(Carvalho et al., sub.). Herein we provide the first quantitative data on the relationship and\n\nconsistency between the abundance and biodiversity of the attendant epifaunal assemblages and\n\na set of gorgonian colony attributes intended to represent the effects of the surface available for\n\ncolonization, the structural complexity and heterogeneity, and the functional (trophic) intricacy.\n\nIn previous studies namely on epifaunal assemblages associated with seagrasses and macroal-\n\ngae, epiphytes were found to have a relevant role in structuring associated mobile epifaunal\n\nassemblages (Cacabelos et al., 2010). Therefore, they were also considered in the present study.\n\nSpecifically, we assessed the following hypotheses: i) higher surface area will result in increasing\n\ndiversity and abundance of associated epifaunal organisms; ii) higher structural complexity of\n\ngorgonians will result in increasing diversity and abundance of associated epifaunal organisms;\n\niii) \u201ccolonial\u201d epibiont cover (e.g. bryozoans, hydrozoans, sponges and macroalgae) of gorgonians\n\nhas a relevant role in structuring attendant epifaunal assemblages; and iv) different taxonomic and\n\nor functional groups will respond differently to gorgonian attributes as they have different habitat\n\nrequisites.\n\n4.2. Materials and Methods\n\n4.2.1. Gorgonian species selected and their attributes\n\nThe genera Leptogorgia and Eunicella have a worldwide distribution. For the purposes of\n\nthe present study, the species Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella gazella were selected, which\n\nare widely distributed in the region and among the most abundant gorgonians in the southern\n\nPortuguese coast (C\u00fardia et al., sub.a). Although both species belong to the family Gorgoniidae,\n\nmorphologically they are different: Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies are generally larger in width\n\nthan in height, while Eunicella gazella colonies are more evenly shaped (i.e. display similar width\n\nand height). Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies may reach up to 80 cm in width, while Eunicella\n\ngazella is a small-sized species reaching a maximum of 35 cm in height. Branches of Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica may have different colours, while Eunicella gazella branches are generally white and\n\nthicker.\n\nIn order to assess the effect of surface available for colonization we measured the height and\n\nmaximum width of each colony and estimated the total surface area. Both, maximum height\n\nand width were measured in the laboratory, where each colony was photographed with a digital\n\n122\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF INVERTEBRATE EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH\nGORGONIANS ARE DRIVEN BY COLONY ATTRIBUTES\n\ncamera at right angles (90\u00b0) using a tripod to keep a fixed linear distance to the gorgonian,\n\nmaintaining scale. The estimation of the total surface area was based on the photos using the\n\nImageJ software (Rasband, 2010). The estimation of the total surface area instead of volume\n\nresulted from the relative bi-dimensional structure of the gorgonians. Structural complexity\n\nwas inferred by measuring fractal dimension (D ), while lacunarity was calculated as a proxy for\n\nheterogeneity, based on the photos of each colony and using the ImageJ software. Specifically,\n\nfor fractal analysis it was used the Box-Couting method, which involves laying a square mesh grid\n\nof various sizes (r ), over the gorgonian image (fractal) to count how many boxes (N ), are needed\n\nto cover it completely. To implement the Box-Counting Method, the plugin FracLac for Image J\n\n(Karperien, 2012) was used. The sizes of the square box forming the grid varied from 2 to 200 pixels\n\nusing the following custom sizes (2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200). The number of boxes (N ) that\n\ncontain any part of the fractal object (gorgonian) were automatically counted for each iteration\n\nwith different box sizes. The fractal dimension, which is characteristic of the morphology, i.e., the\n\noverall structure of the gorgonian colony, is defined as the structural fractal dimension (D )\n\nD = log N\nlog r\n\nand it was calculated by the program as the mean fractal dimension over 50 scans of differing\n\ngrid positions. This fractal dimension is meaningful for objects with complex outlines such as\n\ngorgonians (Martin-Garin et al., 2007).\n\nLacunarity describes the texture of a fractal, using the size distribution of holes of that fractal. If\n\na fractal has large gaps or holes, it has high lacunarity (Karperien, 2012). Lacunarity was calculated\n\nas:\n\nE?r = 1 +\n?r\n\n\u00b5r\n\n2\n\nwhere ? is the standard deviation of the number of pixels and \u00b5 is the average number of pixels in\n\nsquares of size r . During the calculation of E? the pixels of the image background were considered\n\ntogether with the object pixels. The mean lacunarity value was calculated for 50 grids of different\n\norigin.\n\nBesides these morphological attributes, the abundance of macroscopic algae, cnidarians,\n\nbryozoans, sponges and hydrozoans was scored by a semi-quantitative index ranging from 0 to\n\n4 (0 \u2013 absent; 1 \u2013 rare; 2 \u2013 common; 3 \u2013 abundant; 4 \u2013 very abundant). Scoring was always\n\ncarried out by the same observer in order to minimize bias. For simplicity, this relative index will\n\nbe hereafter designated as CEC (as for \u201ccolonial\u201d epibiont cover, where the term colonial is used\n\nloosely to represent modular organisms). CEC will be used to infer the enhancement of functional\n\nintricacy of the gorgonian colonies derived from the presence of sessile organisms which may\n\nprovide additional ecological niches and/or a greater variety of food resources for the attendant\n\ninvertebrate assemblages. For each colony, CEC will be the sum of the scores of each epibiont\n\n123\n\n\n\nPART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\nobserved.\n\n4.2.2. Study areas and sampling design\n\nSampling was undertaken in two consecutive summers (2010 and 2011), at Pedra da Greta (PG),\n\nthe main rocky subtidal area in the central part of the Algarve coast, with approximately 3.6 km in\n\nlength and ranging from 20\u201390 m in width and located at approximately 15 m depth (see C\u00fardia\n\net al., sub.a; Carvalho et al., sub., for more details). The summer period was chosen because it\n\ngenerally corresponds to the peak of invertebrates\u2019 diversity and abundance in this region. In each\n\nsampling period, 18 colonies of each species were collected with different length-sizes totalling\n\n72 colonies. Each colony was enclosed in a plastic bag to prevent faunal loss and then carefully\n\ndetached from the substrate. All gorgonians were transported to the laboratory for processing.\n\n4.2.3. Biodiversity of attendant assemblages\n\nIn the laboratory the colonies were preserved in 96 % ethanol. All samples were washed through\n\na 100 \u00b5m mesh sieve and colonies were observed under a magnifying glass to ensure that all fauna\n\n(mobile epifauna and colonial epibionts) and flora had been removed. All specimens associated\n\nwith each colony were preserved in 96 % ethanol and afterwards identified to the lowest practice\n\ntaxonomic level. To estimate species richness (i.e. the number of species per colony), uniden-\n\ntifiable organisms were, whenever possible, differentiated into different operational taxonomic\n\nunits (OTUs). If animals were juveniles and/or were extremely damaged and it was not possible\n\nto recognize whether they were different entities or belong to any of the already identified species,\n\nthey were not used in the analyses. The number of taxa and individuals per colony, as well as the\n\n(Hurlbert, 1971) expected number of species E S(100) were calculated both for the whole assemblage\n\nand for the main taxonomic groups separately (Arthropoda, Mollusca, Polychaeta). Feeding habits\n\nwere also ascribed for all OTUs with more than 10 individuals, based on literature available.\n\n4.2.4. Data analysis\n\nIn order to assess the relationship between gorgonian attributes (Table 4.1) and the biodiversity\n\nand abundance of the attendant epifaunal assemblage, Spearman rank correlations were per-\n\nformed. The best combination of gorgonian attributes explaining the diversity and abundance\n\npatterns of the attendant epifaunal assemblages were determined using a backwards-stepwise\n\nmultiple generalized linear regression. This approach, recommended whenever co-linearity\n\nbetween independent variables is suspected (Haedrich et al., 2008), begins with a full model,\n\n124\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF INVERTEBRATE EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH\nGORGONIANS ARE DRIVEN BY COLONY ATTRIBUTES\n\nincluding all independent variables. Then, based on standard criteria, the variables failing at\n\ncontributing to the explanation of the dependent variable (number of species or abundance) are\n\nsystematically eliminated (Younger, 1979).

Results\n\nAttendant epifaunal assemblages were numerically dominated by arthropods, accounting for\n\n48 % and 65 % of total abundance in Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively\n\n(Figure 4.1, top).\n\nMolluscs were also abundant in both gorgonians (18 % in Eunicella gazella and 22 % in Lep-\n\ntogorgia lusitanica). On the other hand, the Platyhelminthes, which were exclusive of Eunicella\n\ngazella epifaunal assemblages, were the second most abundant group. In terms of species richness\n\n(i.e. the number of different OTUs), polychaetes were highly diverse, accounting for more than\n\n30 % of total number of species on both gorgonians) (Figure 4.1, center). Indeed, in Eunicella\n\ngazella assemblages, polychaetes were the richest group (34 %), followed by arthropods (31 %)\n\nand molluscs (29 %). In Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies, arthropods were dominant, not only in\n\nabundance but also in number of species (35 % of total number of species), followed by annelids\n\n(33 %) and molluscs (27 %) (Figure 4.1, center).\n\nRegarding the feeding guilds of the attendant epifaunal assemblages, in Eunicella gazella\n\ncarnivores/omnivores and suspension-feeders/deposit-feeders were the dominant feeding modes\n\n(Figure 4.1, bottom). Epifaunal assemblages associated with Leptogorgia lusitanica colonies\n\npresented a more evenly distribution of the main feeding guild, that is to say that, besides the\n\nabove mentioned trophic guilds, the contribution of deposit-feeders, deposit-feeders/herbivores\n\nand suspension-feeders was also relevant.\n\n125\n\n\n\nPART II.

Discussion\n\nThe use of different measures of habitat complexity together with different sampling methods\n\nhampers direct comparisons of results gathered on the relationships between habitat complexity\n\nand associated animal assemblages. Besides, measures of structural complexity can change\n\nunpredictably across spatial scales and typical coral habitats are too complex for any single\n\nmeasure of complexity (Knudby and LeDrew, 2007). In coral reef systems, overall, species diversity\n\nof fish (Nagelkerken et al., 2000; Gratwicke and Speight, 2005a; Lingo and Szedlmayer, 2006; Wilson\n\net al., 2007) and epifaunal invertebrate assemblages (Vytopil and Willis, 2001; Idjadi and Edmunds,\n\n2006) have been positively correlated with habitat complexity. In some studies, results differed\n\nwith the nature of the reef (\u00d6hman and Rajasuriya, 1998) or were inconsistent in studied areas\n\n(Luckhurst and Luckhurst, 1978; Bejarano et al., 2011). Other studies also reported no relationship\n\nbetween species diversity and habitat complexity (Caballero and Schmitter-Soto, 2001). This\n\ninconsistency in the results obtained may be related to the use of different measures of complexity\n\nor the scales at which complexity was assessed, as, according to some authors (e.g. Knudby and\n\nLeDrew, 2007), it should preferably match the typical body size of the organisms whose habitat\n\nis being investigated. Although in the present study habitat complexity assessed by fractals was\n\nmeasured at the scale of the gorgonian colony, evidence of gorgonian habitat complexity leading\n\nto the enhancement of its attendant assemblage biodiversity was not unequivocal.\n\nThe present results demonstrate that gorgonian colony attributes affect species richness and\n\n133\n\n\n\nPART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\nabundance of associated epifaunal assemblages in varying degrees. Moreover, this study also\n\nsupport the hypothesis predicting a differential response of different taxonomic groups to gor-\n\ngonian attributes as a result of their different environmental and or biological requisites. The\n\nmost striking pattern emerging from the results is that the colonial epibiont cover of gorgonians\n\nis always recovered as a significant and the most relevant attribute of the gorgonian habitat for\n\nthe biodiversity and abundance of their attendant assemblages. Although multiple factors are\n\nexpected to influence epifaunal assemblage patterns associated with gorgonians, the abundance\n\nof epibionts in each colony consistently enhanced diversity and abundance of all non-colonial\n\nspecies, although size measures (area, width and/or height) were also relevant. Despite some\n\nascendancy of the structural complexity and heterogeneity measures in the multiple regression\n\nanalyses (but only in Leptogorgia lusitanica), the biological structural component of the habitat\n\nwas always the most relevant. This suggests that the enhancement of local diversity promoted\n\nby gorgonians may be also indirectly supported by these organisms that settle and grow up\n\non the external surface of their skeletons. Associations of marine invertebrates and colonial\n\nanimals, other than corals (Harvell, 1984; Lindberg and Stanton, 1988; Conradi et al., 2000; Dauby\n\net al., 2001; Ribeiro et al., 2003), or even algae (Hall and Bell, 1988; Bologna and Heck Jr., 1999;\n\nCacabelos et al., 2010) have been frequently reported, reinforcing the need for a better knowledge\n\non the associations between corals and associated fauna. This possible dependency might reflect\n\ndifferent faunal strategies to exploit the colonial epibiont organisms. Indeed, previous studies on\n\nthe relationships between macroalgae/seagrasses and associated epifaunal assemblages reported\n\nthat epiphytes (mainly algae) play an important role in structuring the patterns of distribution\n\nand abundance of mobile organisms (Schneider and Mann, 1991; Martin-Smith, 1993; Attrill\n\net al., 2000; Cacabelos et al., 2010). These organisms can increase structural complexity (Hall\n\nand Bell, 1988; Schneider and Mann, 1991; Martin-Smith, 1993) and/or provide additional food\n\nresources (Kitting et al., 1984; Orth and Van Montfrans, 1984; Bologna and Heck Jr., 1999; Jones\n\nand Thornber, 2010), which will probably contribute to the maintenance of more diverse and\n\nabundant epifaunal assemblages. According to Rotjan and Lewis (2008), concerning scleractinian\n\nfauna, the 51 invertebrate corallivore species are in fact a small proportion of the total amount\n\nof invertebrate fauna described as being associated with coral species (Stella et al., 2011). For\n\noctocorals, namely gorgonians, it is also known that some gastropods feed on their hosts\u2019 living\n\ntissue (Patton, 1972; Burkepile and Hay, 2007; Garc\u00eda-Matucheski and Muniain, 2010), but most\n\nof the other invertebrate-associated fauna does not (Patton, 1972; Kumagai, 2008). On the\n\nother hand, several amphipods, which were numerically dominant here, have been reported to\n\nfeed on algae, bryozoans and hydrozoans (Duffy and Hay, 2000; Dauby et al., 2001). During a\n\nmanipulative experiment testing the relative importance of trophic and structural characteristics\n\nof seagrass epiphytes on macrofaunal associated organisms, Bologna and Heck Jr. (1999) found\n\nthat mobile seagrass fauna responded positively to the presence of new trophic resources, rather\n\nthan the increases in secondary structure. Only caprellids (Crustacea: Amphipoda) appeared\n\n134\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF INVERTEBRATE EPIFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES ASSOCIATED WITH\nGORGONIANS ARE DRIVEN BY COLONY ATTRIBUTES\n\nto be associated with both the structure and trophic resources of epiphytes. Other authors,\n\nhowever, observed that both epiphyte cover and substratum shape were relevant in determining\n\nthe distribution of epifaunal invertebrates in seagrass beds but responses were species-dependent\n\n(Schneider and Mann, 1991). In the present study, significant, yet sometimes weak, linear\n\nrelationships were detected in both gorgonians between the abundance of the main trophic groups\n\nand the colonial epibiont cover. These results may indicate either their role as direct food resources\n\nor their contribution for the enhancement of additional food resources (e.g. animals for carnivores\n\nor organically rich particles for suspension/deposit-feeders) adding to the functional intricacy of\n\nthe gorgonian habitat. Regardless the role of epibionts in structuring the epifaunal assemblages\n\nassociated with gorgonians (i.e. food resource or additional habitat), the current results support\n\nthe hypothesis predicting that gorgonians\u2019 epibiont cover (both flora and fauna) is relevant for the\n\npatterns of abundance and diversity of their attendant assemblages.\n\nDespite the strong and consistent significance of epibiont cover, epifaunal abundance and\n\ndiversity were also strongly related to gorgonian attributes representing the surface available\n\nfor colonization, although not consistently between gorgonian species or across faunal groups.\n\nThis relationship depended on the host considered as well as on the faunal group analysed.\n\nIn the present study, regardless the measure used, the correlations between animal abundance\n\nand habitat attributes was always weaker than those found for diversity, which corroborates the\n\nfindings of earlier studies (\u00d6hman and Rajasuriya, 1998; Idjadi and Edmunds, 2006).\n\nTaken into consideration the studies highlighting the relationship between structural com-\n\nplexity and diversity in marine environments both for fish and invertebrates, the non significant\n\ncorrelations between the fractal measure of complexity and both the number of species and\n\nabundance of invertebrate assemblages generally found could be surprising. Although this is the\n\nfirst attempt to apply fractal dimensions in estimating habitat complexity in coral colonies and to\n\nassess its relationship with associated epifaunal assemblages, this is a common approach to plants\n\nand algae (Morse et al., 1985; Gee and Warwick, 1994; Davenport et al., 1999; Attrill et al., 2000).\n\nAttrill et al. (2000) while assessing the relationship between seagrass structural complexity and\n\nthe associated macroinvertebrate community found that seagrass biomass rather than complexity\n\nwas the crucial factor for the enhancement of the number of individuals and species. As no\n\nsignificant positive relationship was detected between biomass and complexity, the authors linked\n\nthe increase in species diversity with increasing seagrass biomass to a species-area relationship\n\neffect (larger surface area available for colonization). These authors proposed that the relationship\n\nbetween seagrass biomass and macroinvertebrate diversity was a sampling artefact resulting from\n\nthe probability of collecting more of the rarer species as the area sampled increases. The results\n\nof the present quantitative, statistically-based study also suggest that the patterns of diversity and\n\nabundance of epifaunal assemblages seems to be better explained by a greater surface available for\n\ncolonization and the enhancement of additional ecological niches (and food resources) promoted\n\n135\n\n\n\nPART II. GORGONIANS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED EPIBENTHIC FAUNA\n\nby other colonial organisms and algae attached to the colonies than to the structural complexity\n\nof the colony itself. Nevertheless, if this may occur for gorgonian colonies, the paradigm that\n\nstructural complexity enhances species diversity can still be valid if tested to a broader range of\n\nhabitat complexity (e.g. by comparison to more complex coral species like scleractinians) or to\n\na broader spatial scale (e.g. by comparison of the reef environment or gorgonian aggregation to\n\nother less complex habitats), as suggested for seagrass beds (Attrill et al., 2000). That is to say that\n\nthis paradigm may be scale dependent. This is supported by some studies that analyzed coral\n\nreefs as a whole instead of focusing on the colonies themselves (Luckhurst and Luckhurst, 1978;\n\nChabanet et al., 1997; Gratwicke and Speight, 2005b; Wilson et al., 2007). Besides, manipulative\n\nexperiments on structural complexity using artificial reef blocks to create habitats with different\n\nlevels of complexity also provided evidence supporting the hypothesis that habitat complexity\n\nincreased the diversity of reef-fish species (Lingo and Szedlmayer, 2006). In the case of gorgonians,\n\napparently their importance relies on the overall environment at the aggregation scale instead of\n\nthe scale of individual colonies, which reinforces the need for the conservation of the gorgonian\n\naggregation areas as a whole including their size structure and taxonomical diversity. Nevertheless,\n\nfuture research should attempt to compare corals of contrasting structural complexities (e.g.\n\ngorgonians versus scleractinian) and to separate the effects of habitat complexity, food availability\n\nand shelter in order to better assess the relationship between host attributes and associated\n\nepifaunal assemblages.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nJ.C.

REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nAbstract\n\nThe annual development of the reproductive structures of a shallow (16 m depth) popula-\n\ntion of the gorgonian Eunicella gazella was found to be highly synchronized between sexes.\n\nThe sex ratio of 1.09 (F:M) was close to parity. The spermatogenic cycle took six to eight\n\nmonths but the oogenic cycle was much longer, taking more than one year for mature oocytes\n\nto develop. High fecundity was observed in females(27.30 \u00b1 13.24 oocytes polyp?1) and males\n(49.30 \u00b1 31.14 sperm sacs polyp?1) immediately before spawning, and these values are amongst the\nhighest values to date in temperate gorgonians. Spawning occurred in September/October after\n\na period of high sea surface temperatures. Females release high numbers of large sized mature\n\noocytes (9.10 \u00b1 4.60 oocytes polyp?1) but retain immature oocytes that develop only in the next\nseason. Fecundity was found to be correlated to polyp size but apparently not to colony size.\n\nBroadcast spawning is proposed as reproductive mode and no evidence of surface or internal\n\nbrooding was observed. Even though common and abundant in the area, the colonies of Eunicella\n\ngazella frequently present high damage and the reproductive strategy of the species is discussed\n\naccordingly.\n\nKeywords: gorgonians \u2022 Eunicella \u2022 reproduction \u2022 oogenesis \u2022 spermatogenesis \u2022\n\nfecundity \u2022 spawning\n\n5.1. Introduction\n\nDemography and life-history traits shape the size of populations, having a huge impact on\n\nthe persistence, decline, local extinction, and recovery of those populations. Reproduction is\n\nthe main driver of most organisms, which invest large amounts of energy on progeny (e.g. Coma\n\net al., 1998; Leuzinger et al., 2003; Harshman and Zera, 2007). The reproductive strategy is\n\nspecies dependent (or even population dependent), being shaped by biological, ecological and\n\nenvironmental factors, playing a crucial role in the population dynamics and biogeography of\n\nmarine organisms (Grosberg and Levitan, 1992; Strathmann et al., 2002). Changes in patterns\n\nof recruitment may also have a major influence on the size of local populations (Hughes et al.,\n\n2000; Marshall and Keough, 2006), either increasing or decreasing them, and depending on\n\nthe ecological role of the species, the effects can scale up to the community level (Grosberg\n\nand Levitan, 1992; Teixid\u00f3 et al., 2011). In a marine species, the local degree of recruitment\n\nsuccess depends on the stochastic variation of several environmental and biological factors, such\n\nas direction, frequency and speed of currents, availability of space, density of predators and\n\nphytoplankton biomass. However, the pool of recruits is governed primarily by the number of eggs\n\n146\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING\nSHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS\n\nthat can be fertilized, ultimately depending on the reproductive strategy of each species and local\n\nconstraints (Lasker and Stewart, 1992; Levitan, 1993). Therefore, aiming at maximizing offspring,\n\nthe reproductive cycle of a species integrates not only its evolutionary path (life-history) but also\n\nlocal constraints, in response to selective pressure.\n\nThe Anthozoa (Cnidaria) are one of the most conspicuous faunal groups in the marine envir-\n\nonment, comprising approximately 7500 species (Daly et al., 2007). Gorgonians (Anthozoa: Alcy-\n\nonacea) are important habitat builders as they provide structure, thus increasing the complexity of\n\nthe system (Jones et al., 1994, 1997). They play an important ecological role in sublittoral benthic\n\ncommunities, providing habitat for other fauna and increasing the diversity and biomass of the\n\ncommunity (Wendt et al., 1985; Cerrano et al., 2009). Their structuring role in temperate marine\n\nshallow ecosystems is linked to their population dynamics (e.g. density and size distribution),\n\nwhich are strongly influenced by reproductive aspects. The reproduction of cnidarians is diverse\n\nand can be very complex because of the high plasticity proportioned by their simple morphology\n\nand the lack of constraints common in higher metazoan taxa (Fautin, 2002). Even though\n\noctocorals may have the possibility to propagate asexually (a reproductive mode that may be\n\nhighly underestimated, according to Fautin 2002), sexuality seems to be the norm in this subclass\n\nwith approximately 3000 species (Daly et al., 2007), being highly retained during the evolutionary\n\nprocess (Kahng et al., 2011), similarly to what happens in scleractinian corals (Kerr et al., 2011).\n\nGonochorism predominates in Octocorallia and hermaphroditism is rare, in marked contrast with\n\nhard corals (Scleractinia) where hermaphroditism is the most common type (for a review see\n\nKahng et al., 2011). In octocorals, the reproductive mode (mating) is plastic, with nearly half of\n\nthe species favouring broadcast spawning and the remaining being brooders (40 % internal and\n\n11 % external) (Kahng et al., 2011). External brooding is thought to be an intermediate strategy\n\nbetween broadcast spawning (the original state) and internal brooding (Kahng et al., 2011), a\n\nstrategy associated to more local dispersal (Szmant, 1986).\n\nIn species favouring sexual reproduction, gametes are necessary to ensure offspring to maintain\n\npopulations but also to provide the genetic recombination to cope with environmental change\n\n(e.g. Coffroth and Lasker, 1998; Fautin, 2002). Therefore, gametogenesis and the traits associated\n\nto this process play a major role in reproduction. Because gorgonians are modular organisms and\n\nthe polyp is finite in size, several traits such as the reproductive mode, number of reproductive\n\nstructures and size govern the energy investment to enhance larval survival (Hall and Hughes,\n\n1996; Leuzinger et al., 2003; Henry and Hart, 2005). For example, in octocorals, oocytes are\n\ngenerally large but oocyte size is not clearly related to sexuality, reproductive mode or polyp\n\nfecundity (Kahng et al., 2011). However, clades within octocorals present significant differences\n\nin oocyte size, suggesting that this trait is conserved along the evolution of these taxa (Kahng\n\net al., 2011). On the other hand, polyp fecundity (number of oocytes or sperm sacs) may present\n\nsignificant differences at regional and local scales, reflecting differences in environmental factors\n\n147\n\n\n\nPART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nsuch as temperature (e.g. Gori et al., 2007, ress; Torrents and Garrabou, 2011). Therefore, energy\n\nallocation to reproduction is a complex task governed by internal and external factors and the\n\ninteractions between them (Marshall and Keough, 2006). Identifying the main traits and drivers\n\nassociated to the reproduction of a species is crucial for building specific models that can be used\n\nto predict the reproductive output of a determined species in a specific area.\n\nMarine ecosystems face several pressures worldwide, such as overfishing, coastal development,\n\npollution, tourism and climate change (e.g. Turner et al., 1999; Milazzo et al., 2002; Fox et al., 2003;\n\nWatling and Auster, 2005; Halpern et al., 2008; Mora, 2008), with differential response from the\n\nbiota and complex networks of interactions between living resources and their habitats. There\n\nis evidence that gorgonian populations are affected by natural or/and anthropogenic factors (e.g.\n\nComa et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008a). Recently, it has been proven that shallow circalitoral areas\n\nin southern Portugal are characterized by a mixed population of gorgonian species (Gon\u00e7alves\n\net al., 2010; C\u00fardia et al., 2sub) and their conservation must be prioritized (Anonymous, 2011).\n\nNatural and human disturbances are normally measured in terms of their effects on adult\n\nabundances and mortality rates, while the impacts on the reproductive biology and regenerative\n\nprocesses are usually ignored because they are less obvious (e.g. Hughes et al., 2000; Teixid\u00f3\n\net al., 2011). Damage resulting from disturbance normally implies tissue regeneration that is\n\nenergetically demanding (Linares et al., 2008a), and the allocation of energy for regeneration may\n\nimpair not only the growth of the colonies but also their reproductive output, especially in larger\n\ncolonies that sometimes are responsible for most of the reproductive output of a population (e.g.\n\nHall and Hughes, 1996; Kapela and Lasker, 1999). It has been proven that disturbance decreases\n\nthe reproductive output of these colonial organisms (e.g. Linares et al., 2005, 2008a; Torrents\n\nand Garrabou, 2011; Tsounis et al., 2012) with serious effects in their population dynamics and\n\nconservation (Tsounis et al., 2006; Linares et al., 2008b). Localized changes that affect coral\n\nreproduction at one location may also have important effects on nearby populations because of\n\nthe strong link between benthic and larval stages (Hughes et al., 2000). In fact, small changes\n\nin coral fecundity can result in large changes in recruitment leading to dramatic effects of large\n\nmagnitude (Hughes et al., 2000).\n\nManagement of coastal areas where ecosystem engineers are present should always take into\n\naccount the dynamics of those species, and the processes affecting the stocks of adults, namely\n\nrecruitment. Because of the importance of gorgonian species for the Mediterranean coralligenous\n\nreefs (Bavestrello et al., 1997; Linares et al., 2005, 2007; Ballesteros, 2006), several reproductive\n\naspects of the most abundant gorgonian species have been addressed in the recent past (e.g.\n\nComa et al., 2004; Tsounis et al., 2006; Ribes et al., 2007; Linares et al., 2008a) in order to provide\n\nbaseline data and fulfil knowledge gaps. In contrast, such information is missing for common\n\nspecies from the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, such as Eunicella labiata, Eunicella\n\n148\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING\nSHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS\n\ngazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica (C\u00fardia et al., 2sub). Because Eunicella gazella is one of the\n\nmost affected gorgonian species in the south Portugal (unpublished data), presenting both high\n\ndamage frequency (percentage of damaged colonies) and extension (percentage of the colony area\n\ndamaged), knowledge on the reproductive processes of this species is crucial for understanding\n\nthe life-history patterns of the species and a preliminary step towards assessing the ability of these\n\nspecies to recover from disturbances. In this context, the current study aims at describing the\n\nreproductive cycle of Eunicella gazella, a poorly studied species, namely concerning oogenesis,\n\nspermatogenesis, fecundity and time of spawning. The reproductive aspects analysed in this study\n\nwill be discussed in terms of their importance for the distribution of the species in the context of\n\nareas under multiple pressures.\n\n5.2. Materials and Methods\n\n5.2.1. Study area\n\nThe collection of samples was undertaken in Pedra da Greta, a rocky area used as fishing ground\n\nlocated near Faro, southern Portugal. This rocky formation extends for nearly 3 km long, ranging\n\nfrom a few metres in width to 80 m in the widest areas, and a depth range of 14\u201318 m. Geologically,\n\nthe elevated surface represents a fossilized ancient dunar belt that went underwater with sea-\n\nlevel rising long time ago, constituting one of the largest hard-bottom areas in the eastern part\n\nof the Algarve coast. The area is characterized by numerous small canyons running parallel and\n\nperpendicularly to the coast creating a \u201cgiants\u2019 causeway\u201d bottom, with vertical relief varying from\n\n0.3 to 4 m. Considerable topographic complexity is provided by such 3-dimensional arrangement,\n\nresulting in numerous small holes, caves and overhangs that provide refuge for a large number\n\nof species, including several commercially important species. Professional fishermen use a wide\n\nvariety of fishing gears in this reef (e.g. trammel nets and gill nets, hook lines, pots and cages,\n\njiggling) but recreational fishermen also use this area, especially during summer. This constant\n\nfishing activity results in large quantities of lost fishing gears in the bottom, but also in direct\n\ndamage to gorgonian colonies. Damaged colonies are very frequent in this area, presenting\n\nextensive partial mortality, overgrowth and/or signs of breaking (many times loosing more than\n\nhalf of the colony).\n\n5.2.2. Sampling\n\nSamples were collected monthly from July 2009 to July 2010. Winter months (November to\n\nFebruary) were characterized by frequent periods of bad weather that did not allow sampling in\n\n149\n\n\n\nPART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\ntwo dates, November 2009 and February 2010. At each sampling period, fragments of the apical\n\npart of 30 colonies of Eunicella gazella were collected by SCUBA diving, selecting colonies that\n\nwere not extensively damaged and without clear signs of faunal overgrowth. The maximum height\n\n(nearest cm) of each sampled colony was recorded. Biological material was preserved in 10 %\n\nbuffered formalin until further analyses.\n\n5.2.3. Reproductive cycle and fecundity\n\nAlthough the term \u201cgonads\u201d has been widely used in scientific publications regarding anthozo-\n\nans, according to Fautin and Mariscal (1991) the so-called gonads are simply gametogenic areas\n\nof the mesenteries. The equivalence of each individual oocyte (or spermary) to a single gonad\n\nin order to quantify fecundity and other reproductive parameters should be avoided in future\n\ncontributions. The term \u201creproductive structures\u201d is used in those cases where no special reference\n\nis made to one of the sexes.\n\nThe oogenic cycle was studied over a 13 month period, with 11 sampling periods (mentioned\n\nabove). For the spermatogenic cycle, 6 time periods ( July, September and October 2009; January,\n\nApril and July 2010) were analysed. For both sexes, a total of 5 colonies was analysed at each\n\nsampling date. Spicules were de-calcified using a 10 % formic acid solution diluted with 4 %\n\nformalin. For each colony, 10 randomly chosen polyps, located at 1\u20135 cm of the branch tip\n\nwere dissected under a stereo microscope. For each polyp, reproductive structures (oocytes or\n\nspermaries) were counted under the stereo microscope at full magnification (50\u00d7). The polyp\ncontent was then placed on a microscope slide with a drop of 10 % lactic acid and covered with\n\na cover slip. The preparation was observed only 24 h after this procedure to allow the lactic\n\nacid to degrade the tissues, thus making easier the detection and identification of the oocytes or\n\nspermaries. The maximum and minimum diameters of all reproductive structures were measured\n\nwith an eyepiece micrometer.\n\nOocytes and spermaries were spherical or ellipsoidal in shape, therefore the equivalent dia-\n\nmeter of the ellipse (D ) was estimated using the formula:\n\nD = AB\n3(a + b) ?\n\np\n(3a + b) \u00d7 (a + 3b)\n\nwhere A is the maximum diameter; B is the minimum diameter; a is A2 and b is\nB\n2 .\n\nThe volume of each oocyte or spermary was estimated using the formula:\n\nV = 0.75?\u00d7 (0.5D )3\n\n150\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING\nSHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS\n\nwhere V is the volume of oocyte or spermary and D is its equivalent diameter. Finally, the volume\n\nof oocytes or spermaries per polyp was calculated as the sum of the volume of the oocytes or\n\nspermaries.\n\nDevelopment of reproductive structures in both sexes was also analysed using histological\n\ntechniques. Before processing tissue samples for histology, gorgonian spicules were de-calcified\n\nusing a solution of 10% formic acid in 4% buffered formalin and the axis of the colonies was\n\ncarefully removed with fine pointed tongs. Small pieces of tissue were dehydrated in a graded\n\nethanol series and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections of 10 \u00b5m thickness were cut in a\n\nmicrotome and left to dry in the oven at 37 ?C for at least 48 h. Histological cuts were stained using\nthe Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) method (Kiernan, 1990).\n\nIn this study, fecundity is defined as the number of oocytes (or spermaries) in a polyp over\n\na reproductive season, following the recommendations of Llodra (2002) to obtain the maximum\n\ninformation of the data analysed.\n\n5.2.4. Environmental data\n\nMonthly data on sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll a, photosynthetically available\n\nradiation (PAR) and particulate organic carbon (POC) during the study period were used for\n\ncorrelations with the gametogenic cycle. Data on SST was gathered from the oceanographic buoy\n\nlocated at ? 2 nautical miles from the study area (www.hidrografico.pt/boias-ondografo.php).\nChlorophyll a concentrations, PAR and POC were derived from satellite remote sensing data,\n\ncollected from the Giovanni online data system (MODIS-Aqua 4 km, monthly processed data,\n\navailable at http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/overview/index.html), developed and main-\n\ntained by the NASA Goddard Environmental Sciences Data and Information Services Center - GES\n\nDISC (Acker and Leptoukh, 2007). Chlorophyll a and POC data are used as proxies for primary\n\nproduction (phytoplankton) and secondary production (zooplankton).\n\n5.2.5. Statistical analyses\n\nThe sex ratio was compared with parity (1F:1M) using the ?2 test (Wilson and Hardy, 2002).\n\nThe non parametric Kruskal-Wallis\u2019 U test was employed to compare colony size, the number of\n\nreproductive structures per polyp, volume of oocytes or spermaries and polyp equivalent diameter\n\nbetween sampling periods. Multivariate comparison tests were performed whenever significant\n\ndifferences were detected.\n\nIn some monthly sampling periods, the size-frequency distribution of oocyte diameters (equi-\n\n151\n\nwww.hidrografico.pt/boias-ondografo.php\nhttp://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/overview/index.html\n\n\nPART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nvalent diameter of ellipse) presented two modes. In order to separate the two components of\n\nthe mixed distribution, the method described by Macdonald and Green (1988) was used. This\n\nmethod employs grouped data to find the best fit for component distributions to histogram data\n\n(in this case comparing a single mode against two modes), using chi-squared approximation to\n\nthe likelihood ratio test. We used mixdist (Macdonald and Green, 1988), using grouped data (size\n\nclasses of 20 \u00b5m) to calculate the parameter values (?, relative percentage; \u00b5, mean; ?, standard\n\ndeviation) and their standard errors for each component distribution. The program returns a chi-\n\nsquare value for the fit between calculated and empirical histograms. Log-normal distributions\n\nwere used as they presented better fits and because in the absence of bi-modality, the distribution\n\nof data follows the log-normal model.\n\nRegression analysis was used to assess the relationship between colony size, fecundity and\n\nvolume of reproductive structures in both sexes. The effect of polyp size on fecundity and oocyte\n\nvolume was also analysed using regression analysis at two different periods (May-June and July-\n\nAugust, with grouped data to increase statistical power). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was\n\nemployed to test the effect of colony size on these correlations (Bingham and Fry, 2010).\n\nAll analyses were performed in the open source statistical software R v2.14.1. (R Development\n\nCore Team, 2010), with statistical significance set for p &lt;0.05.\n\n5.3. Results\n\n5.3.1. General features and sex ratio\n\nIn general, all fertile polyps from a colony exhibited reproductive structures of the same sex\n\n(gonochoristic). However, one colony from June 2010 identified as female in the stereo microscope,\n\npresented both oocytes and small spermaries (hermaphroditic). Within this hermaphroditic\n\ncolony, all individual polyps analysed (n=10) presented both sperm sacs and oocytes. This colony\n\nwas not considered for estimating the number of reproductive structures per polyp, their volume\n\nand size frequency distribution. Although the sexes are separate, colonies lacked any obvious\n\nsecondary sexual character and the reproductive structures are the only indications of gender. The\n\nsex ratio was 1.09 (?2 = 0.268, p = 0.604), not deviating significantly from parity (1F:1M).\n\nMedium and large-sized oocytes (?150 \u00b5m) are visible under the stereo microscope (50\u00d7\nmagnification) and tend to form small aggregates composed by a few different sized cells growing\n\nfrom the mesenteries. When observed under the microscope (Figure 5.1), these aggregates are\n\ndominated by small-sized cells that are mostly overlooked in the stereo microscope. Those small-\n\nsized cells correspond to pre-vitelogenic cells (80\u2013160 \u00b5m diameter) and are characterized by clear\n\n152\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

Oocytes larger than\n\n250 \u00b5m diameter presented a thick cytoplasmic membrane (5\u201310 \u00b5m), yellow opaque colour and\n\nwere granulated in texture. Histologically, these eosinophilous cells correspond to vitelogenic and\n\nmature oocytes (Figure 5.3). The cytoplasmic membrane of some of the large oocytes was easily\n\ndamaged during manipulation, resulting in abundant lipidic droplets in the disrupted area.\n\nConcerning males, gastrodermis surrounding the reproductive structures over the mesentery\n\nclearly decreases during gametogenesis, being abundant and clearly identifiable in the first stages\n\nand almost absent in ripe spermaries (Figure 5.2). With experience, it was possible to distinguish\n\nthe gastrodermis of male from that of female colonies, based on the morphology and development.\n\nSmaller sperm sacs (25\u2013130 \u00b5m) are ellipsoid in shape and present a thin layer of tissue surround-\n\ning several large and slightly irregularly shaped spermatogonia. Sperm sacs with 140\u2013300 \u00b5m\n\npresent a thick layer of tissue (5\u201310 \u00b5m) surrounding large numbers of spermatocytes, which are\n\nidentifiable in the microscope even without processing the material for histology. Larger sperm\n\nsacs normally do not present gastrodermis tissue in their surroundings (Figure 5.2), are opaque and\n\nwith a darker colouration, but cells cannot be differentiated without processing the material for\n\nhistology. Large sperm sacs in samples of August 2009 were dominated by spermatocytes, whereas\n\nsperm sacs of equivalent dimensions in samples of September and October 2009 presented mostly\n\nspermatozoa and a few spermatocytes. When fully developed, the larger sperm sacs are quite\n\nirregular in shape and very easily disrupted.\n\n5.3.2. Annual cycle of oocyte development\n\nOocytes developed attached to the mesenteries by a short mesogleal stalk at the base of each\n\npolyp. Formation of new oocytes was not synchronous and took place over a six to seven month\n\nperiod (February-March until September-October) (Figures 5.4 and 5.6). The newly formed oo-\n\ncytes (80\u2013160 \u00b5m diameter) remained at approximately the same size until January of the following\n\nyear (Figure 5.6). Between March and May, the previous year\u2019s cohort of oocytes increased up\n\nto 300 \u00b5m in average diameter (Figure 5.6). From June to September these oocytes continued to\n\nmature, increasing their size and volume, and reaching maximum values in September (?500 \u00b5m)\n(Figures 5.5 and 5.6 and Table 5.1). In October, these large oocytes were released and the size-\n\nfrequency distribution is almost entirely composed by the new oocytes produced in the current\n\nseason (Figure 5.6 and Table 5.1). This pattern was also evident in the mean volume of oocytes per\n\npolyp, which increased markedly from March to June and July to September (Figure 5.5).\n\n155\n\n\n\nPART III.

REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\n5.3.3. Annual cycle of spermaries development\n\nIn January, 90 % of the polyps presented reproductive structures, but the number of spermaries\n\nper polyp was very low and their volume was extremely reduced (Figures 5.7 and 5.8 and Table 5.2).\n\nFrom January to September, spermary number and volume increased sharply. In September,\n\nspermaries were ripe and very abundant (14\u2013159, mean of 49.3 spermaries per polyp). In October,\n\nthe number of spermaries declined sharply coincident with the end of spermatogenesis and\n\ngamete release, but volume was still high because of some large spermaries present in many\n\npolyps.\n\nThese results were confirmed by the size-frequency distribution of the sperm sacs diameter.\n\nIn January, newly developed small-sized structures (20\u2013120 \u00b5m in diameter) were predominant in\n\nthe size-frequency distribution. The development of those spermaries was evident in April and\n\nJuly, as distributions showed progressively longer tails to the right and lower contribution of new\n\nstructures (Figure 5.9). The production of new spermaries was halted between July and September\n\n(similar number of sperm sacs per polyp). In September, the size distribution of sperm sacs was\n\nmesokurtic, with slight negative skewness and a large range of diameters (20\u2013624 \u00b5m), but a very\n\nlow contribution of small-sized sperm sacs (20\u2013120 \u00b5m representing less than 20 %). In October,\n\nthe release of spermatozoa produced a negatively skewed distribution with a narrower range of\n\nsizes. Spermatogenesis took between eight and ten months to complete, and thus was much\n\nshorter than oogenesis.\n\n5.3.4. Fecundity\n\nFrom the oogenic cycle it was observed that mature oocytes (greater than 350 \u00b5m) were\n\nspawned by late September/October. The mean number of mature oocytes per polyp in September\n\nwas 9.1\u00b14.60 (SD). Considering that the mean number of polyps in a terminal branch is 27.5 cm?1,\nthe estimated number of mature oocytes per cm of Eunicella gazella in the studied area is\n\nroughly 250. The size of mature spermaries is more difficult to estimate since, histologically,\n\nspermatozoa were observed in spermaries presenting a wide size range. However, considering\n\nthe size-frequency distribution of spermaries in September and October, it is expectable that\n\nin September sperm sacs greater than 300 \u00b5m are mature, resulting in 18.8 \u00b1 11.81 sperm sacs\nper polyp and ? 520 mature male reproductive structures per cm of Eunicella gazella, i.e. more\nthan twice the number of mature oocytes. Nevertheless, male fecundity estimates are most likely\n\nunderestimated as the limit of 300 \u00b5m is probably too conservative.\n\n160\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.

Effects of colony and polyp size on fecundity\n\nColony size of the analysed female gorgonians presented some variation throughout the study\n\nperiod (Kruskal-Wallis\u2019 U test: ?29 = 121.74, p &lt;2.2e?16), with lower values in July 2009 and June,\nJanuary and March 2010 (multiple comparisons, p &lt;0.001). This was also observed for males\n(U test, ?24 = 37.84, p = 1.11e?7), with July 2010 presenting larger colonies (multiple comparisons,\np &lt;0.001). For each sampling date and for both sexes, the variation in the number of reproductive\nstructures and their volume within each colony was greater than the variation between colonies.\n\nIt was not detected an evident effect of colony size on the number of oocytes and spermaries and\n\ntheir volume. The size frequency distribution of oocytes or spermaries was not different between\n\ncolonies of different sizes.\n\nThe equivalent diameter of polyps (proxy for polyp size) ranged from 580 to 1373 \u00b5m in females\n\nand 598 to 1433 \u00b5m in males. In August 2009, females presented larger polyps than in the remaining\n\nsampling dates (U test: ?26 = 53.76, p = 8.23e?10). Nevertheless, the variation in polyp size was\nlarger within individual colonies than between colonies. Significant positive linear correlations\n\nbetween polyp size and the number of oocytes were observed for two sets of samples (May-June\n\nand July-August) when production of new reproductive structures and maturation of pre-season\n\noocytes was extremely active. However, these positive trends differed between dates: in May-\n\nJune the effect of polyp size was lower (y = ?1.713 + 0.0163x ) and less evident (r 2 = 0.217, F(1,98) =\n27.16, p &lt;0.001) than in July-August (y = ?28.8421 + 0.0475x ; r 2 = 0.603, F(1,148) = 224.3, p &lt;0.001).\nThese trends were not dependent on colony size (ANCOVA, p > 0.05). However, oocyte volume was\nbetter predicted using a linear model with polyp size and colony size as predictors. In May-June\n\n(r 2 = 0.538, F(2,97) = 56.43, p &lt;0.001) the effects of polyp size (? = 2.94e?4, t(97) = 8.895, p &lt;0.001)\nand height (? = ?3.27e?3, t(97) = ?2.716, p &lt;0.01) were significant. Similarly, in July-August, the\nmultiple regression model y = ?0.399+4.376e?4 polyp size+3.764e?3 height (r 2 = 0.4162, F(2,147) =\n52.4, p &lt;0.001) indicated polyp size (t(147) = 9.638, p &lt;0.001) and colony height (t(147) = 2.597, p&lt;\n\n163\n\n\n\nPART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\n0.05) as suitable predictors of the volume of oocytes. The size frequency distribution of oocytes\n\nand spermaries of different polyp size classes did not present significant differences, a pattern that\n\nwas consistent along the sampling period.\n\n5.3.6. Spawning and larval development\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) presented marked seasonality, with lower temperatures during\n\nwinter (December to March: 14 to 17 ?C) and a relatively large period with high SST during\nsummer ( June-October: 20 to 26 ?C) (Figure 5.10). Chlorophyll a, used as proxy of phytoplankton,\ndisplayed the regular pattern for temperate waters, with a spring bloom (March-April) and a\n\nshorter secondary peak in autumn, presenting a high correlation with POC (r = 0.894, t22 =\n9.36, p &lt;0.001). Radiation available for photosynthesis (PAR) was lower during winter (November-\nFebruary).\n\nSpawning was not observed in situ at any sampling period, but in September and October, small\n\nplumes of white milky substance were observed leaving the polyps when colonies were slightly\n\nsqueezed. This phenomenon was not observed in all sampled colonies nor during other sampling\n\nperiods. We hypothesize that these plumes were formed by spermatozoa because: 1) only a\n\nfraction of the colonies showed this behaviour; 2) the relatively large amount of substance leaving\n\nthe polyps; 3) it was impossible to ascertain individual structures underwater (poor resolution as\n\na result of their small size).\n\nProduction of new oocytes or spermaries and development of pre-season oocytes was more\n\nevident from May to September, coinciding with increasing SST. Ripening of female and male\n\nreproductive structures was highly synchronous, converging in August-September. In October,\n\nwith decreasing SST, fecundity was significantly lower in both sexes (sperm sacs were reduced\n\ntenfold, Table 5.2) and mature reproductive structures were rare, indicating synchronous gamete\n\nrelease between sexes. Significant positive correlations between SST and both the number of\n\nmature oocytes (?300 \u00b5m; r = 0.82, t11 = 4.75, p = 0.006) and oocyte volume (r = 0.81, t11 =\n4.65, p = 0.0007) were registered. Both variables showed maximum values five to seven months\nafter the highest concentrations of POC (lagged correlations; r t?6 = 0.69 for mature oocytes and\nr t?7 = 0.66 for oocyte volume). A peak in POC (and chlorophyll a occurred about two months after\nspawning (November-December).\n\nStructures resembling gorgonian larvae were never observed inside polyps of either female\n\nor male colonies. The maturation of fertilized eggs occurring in mucus material adhering to\n\nthe surface of gorgonians (\u201cbrooding\u201d Coma et al., 1995) was never observed during sampling\n\nor elsewhere in southern Portugal.

Loss of information on number and volume of reproductive structures\n\nThe number of oocytes counted under the stereo microscope predicted significantly the num-\n\nber of oocytes (y = 4.442 + 1.175x , t(400) = 40.84, p &lt;0.001) as well as a significant part of the\nvariance (r 2 = 0.81, F(1,400) = 1668, p &lt;0.001). This trend was independent of the sampling date\n(ANCOVA, p > 0.05). The same pattern was observed for male colonies (y = 4.182 + 1.537x , t(191) =\n6.402, p &lt;0.001; r 2 = 0.926, F(1,191) = 2405, p &lt;0.001) although the slope was significantly lower in\nSeptember 2009 (y = 2.298 + 1.231x , t(38) = 6.402, p &lt;0.001; r 2 = 0.964, F(1,38) = 1059, p &lt;0.001).\n\n5.4. Discussion\n\n5.4.1. Sex ratio\n\nThe present study showed that Eunicella gazella is an iteroparous species with an annual\n\nreproductive cycle like several other temperate gorgonians, such as Eunicella singularis (Gori et al.,\n\n2007, ress; Ribes et al., 2007), Eunicella verrucosa (Munro, 2004), Leptogorgia sarmentosa (Rossi\n\nand Gili, 2009) and Paramuricea clavata (Coma et al., 1995; Gori et al., 2007). The observed sex\n\nratio, not deviating significantly from parity, is similar to that reported for most species already\n\nstudied (e.g. Coma et al., 1995; Orejas et al., 2002; Tsounis et al., 2006; Ribes et al., 2007). This\n\npattern of balanced sex ratio is in accordance with optimal resource allocation in populations\n\nwith random mating. However, biased sex ratios have been documented, both for females (e.g.\n\nCoffroth and Lasker, 1998; Ben-Yosef and Benayahu, 1999; Gori et al., 2007; Excoffon et al., 2011)\n\nor males (e.g. Brazeau and Lasker, 1992; Cerrano et al., 2005; Gori et al., 2007) (see also Table 5.3).\n\nMale biased sex ratios are supposed to increase fertilization success in gorgonians with brooding\n\nbehavior (Benayahu and Loya, 1984b), by reducing sperm limitation effects (Levitan, 1993; Kahng\n\net al., 2011). Because several octocoral species present oocytes all year round they are more likely\n\nto be identified, and this was suggested to be one of the reasons why female biased sex ratios in\n\noctocorals are quite common in the literature (Kahng et al., 2011).\n\n5.4.2. Fecundity\n\nEunicella gazella presented large mature oocytes (Table 5.4). The observed values are slightly\n\nlower than those displayed by the internal brooder Eunicella singularis, but higher than those\n\n166\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING\nSHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS\n\nreported for the broadcast spawner Eunicella verrucosa (Table 5.4). Even though large oocyte sizes\n\n(usually ?600 \u00b5m) are usually found in species with internal fertilisation and brooding incubation\nmode (Orejas et al., 2002, and references therein), a recent review on the reproduction of octocorals\n\nfound no relationship between oocyte size and reproduction mode; yet, species with extended\n\noogenesis (over one year) have substantially larger oocytes than species with shorter oogenesis\n\n(Kahng et al., 2011). On the other hand, the fecundity of Eunicella gazella (number of mature\n\noocytes per polyp) is within the highest values for the gorgonian species studied (Coma et al., 1995;\n\nKahng et al., 2011; Torrents and Garrabou, 2011). Within the genus Eunicella, this is the highest\n\nfecundity ever reported, namely for Eunicella singularis (0.7\u20132.9 oocytes polyp?1, Gori et al., 2007;\n\nRibes et al., 2007) and Eunicella verrucosa (3.21\u20133.38 oocytes polyp?1, Munro, 2004). Although\n\nsperm density may limit gorgonian reproductive success, it is the number of eggs produced that\n\nsets the upper limit for reproductive success (Beiring and Lasker, 2000).\n\nMany factors have the potential to affect the fecundity of gorgonians, namely reproductive\n\nseason (multiple spawnings or a seasonal mass event), depth, colony size and polyp position\n\nwithin the colony (e.g. Coma et al., 1995; Kapela and Lasker, 1999; Beiring and Lasker, 2000;\n\nOrejas et al., 2002). Due to their body morphology, polyp size is space-limited in gorgonians,\n\nand may limit gamete production (Coma and Lasker, 1997) as suggested for corals (Benayahu\n\nand Loya, 1984a). The current findings not only reinforce this idea, as there was a significant\n\npositive correlation between polyp size and fecundity in female colonies, but further suggest that\n\nthe use of available space is optimized during the oogenic and spermatogenic cycles. In fact, when\n\nreproductive structures are at the final stages of maturation (August-September), the polyp cavity\n\nwas completely occupied and the polyps presented a turgid appearance, in both male and female\n\ncolonies. Moreover, new oocytes and sperm sacs develop beside or underneath older ones, thus\n\nachieving maximal space occupation. In Eunicella gazella, this is particularly important because\n\nthe size of reproductive structures is relatively large considering its high fecundity.\n\nThe number of spermaries was 2-3 times higher of that of females, which corroborates previous\n\nstudies on gorgonians (Coma et al., 1995; Tsounis et al., 2006; Ribes et al., 2007; Torrents and\n\nGarrabou, 2011), and may be related to the larger mean size of oocytes, or to other factors such\n\nas energy investment (Torrents and Garrabou, 2011). However, when reproductive structures are\n\nmature (September), estimates of their volume per polyp for females and males are not only similar\n\nbetween sexes, but also to those reported for other gorgonians (Tables 5.3 and 5.4). The volume of\n\nthe reproductive structures within a species is related to fecundity, which may present spatial and\n\ndepth related differences (e.g. Tsounis et al., 2006; Gori et al., 2007, ress; Torrents and Garrabou,\n\n2011, see Tables 5.3 and 5.4). Volume in female and male colonies is similar during the maturation\n\nperiod in July-September, increasing fourfold (e.g. 3.9\u201316.7 mm3, for 50 female polyps). However,\n\nafter spawning in October, the volume decreased tenfold in females (1.6 mm3, 50 polyps) and\n\nthirtyfold in males (0.5 mm3, 50 polyps). This difference between sexes is because females retain\n\n167\n\n\n\nPART III.

III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nsmall oocytes for the next reproductive season.\n\nIn general, fecundity increases with colony size in octocorals (e.g. Benayahu and Loya, 1984a;\n\nComa et al., 1995; Kapela and Lasker, 1999), and within a population large colonies sometimes\n\ncontribute disproportionately to egg production (Coma et al., 1995; Beiring and Lasker, 2000).\n\nIncreasing fecundity with size may result from an increased number of polyps per colony, as well\n\nas an increase in the reproductive output at the polyp level (Beiring and Lasker, 2000), possibly as\n\na consequence of a shift in resource allocation from growth to reproduction once the colony has\n\nreached a size-refuge threshold (Beiring and Lasker, 2000). Colony size effect was not verified in\n\nthe present work, but sampling variation may be masking this effect. Therefore, further studies\n\nwith appropriate replication, performed in a narrow period of time but comprising a broad range\n\nof colony sizes should clarify if the observed pattern was biased due to sampling. In the present\n\nstudy, a positive relationship between fecundity and polyp size was observed at all sampling\n\nperiods, suggesting that variability in polyp size may be responsible for considerable variation\n\nin fecundity, especially considering that the apical position within the colony was fixed, thus\n\nremoving one source of error associated to differences in fecundity within octocoral species. For\n\nsome coral species, polyp volume in medium and large sized colonies is similar, even though\n\nlarge colonies have more polyps (Sakai, 1998). A recent study with Astroides calycularis reported a\n\nlogarithmic relationship between the number of polyps and both colony length and width, but a\n\nlinear relationship with colony area and mass (Goffredo et al., 2011). In addition, large colonies\n\nhad polyps with smaller size than small and medium colonies, due to an over-representation\n\nof the size class containing sexually mature polyps, suggesting that large colonies may invest\n\nenergetic resources to increase the size of young polyps up to the size at sexual maturity, rather\n\nthan increasing the size of already mature polyps (Goffredo et al., 2011). This agrees with the size\n\nthreshold that may lead to differences in energy allocation from growth to reproduction (Sakai,\n\n1998). Indeed, energy investment in reproductive tissue increases in corals with larger polyps, but\n\nthe gonadosomatic index decreases, suggesting polyp size constraints (Sakai, 1998). This change in\n\nenergy allocation from growth-dominated to reproduction-dominated with increasing colony size,\n\nis based on the assumption that reproduction comes at the expense of growth, so it is possible that\n\nage and not colony height would be a better correlate with polyp fecundity (Pakes and Woollacott,\n\n2008).\n\nIn corals, large-scale spatial and temporal variation in recruitment is clearly linked to patterns\n\nof variation in fecundity rather than adult abundance (Hughes et al., 2000). However, a negative\n\ncorrelation between polyp fecundity and population density has been suggested for benthic\n\ncnidarians (Orejas et al., 2002). The present study was conducted in a area where Eunicella\n\ngazella is very frequent and dominant in terms of density (13.2 colonies/5m2) (C\u00fardia et al.,\n\n2sub), although presenting high fecundity. Additional studies in contrasting density levels shall\n\nprovide further insights on this subject. The present study showed that Eunicella gazella favours\n\n170\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING\nSHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS\n\na reproductive strategy with high number of relatively large oocytes and synchronized spawning\n\nto ensure that oocytes are fertilized (probably in the area), which also provides a relatively high\n\ndispersal potential (large oocytes) to colonize adjacent areas with lower density or under lower\n\ncompetitive pressure. In fact, it has been proved that coral larvae are distributed relatively\n\nuniformly among adjacent reefs, but do not undergo larger-scale movements, resulting in modest\n\ngene-flow in spawning corals (Hughes et al., 2000). Eunicella gazella is original from tropical\n\nareas but, apparently, expanded recently its distribution to northern latitudes probably because\n\nof favourable conditions under a global warming scenario. The broadcast spawning behaviour of\n\nthis species, contrasts with the brooding behaviour of Eunicella singularis and Eunicella cavolinii,\n\nthe most common Eunicella species in the Mediterranean, and seems to be efficient, as Eunicella\n\ngazella is frequent and density dominant in southern Portugal (C\u00fardia et al., 2sub). Moreover,\n\nthe populations present numerous small sized colonies (C\u00fardia et al., 2sub), suggesting that\n\nrecruitment events are frequent and successful. In contrast, Eunicella singularis is extremely rare\n\nand Eunicella cavolinii has never been found in southern Portugal, whereas the broadcast spawner\n\nEunicella verrucosa (Munro, 2004), has been recently reported to be expanding its distribution in\n\nthe Mediterranean (Sartoretto and Francour, 2012) and is frequent in southern Portugal (C\u00fardia\n\net al., 2sub). Differences in spawning mode may alter fertilization and recruitment success of\n\ngorgonian species and consequently constrain population dynamics. To what level, under the\n\ncomplex variety of factors acting on coastal areas, one mode is more successful than the other\n\nremains an important but decisive question yet to be fully addressed.\n\n5.4.3. Spawning\n\nThe longer duration of oogenesis compared to spermatogenesis, is a common feature of the\n\nreproductive development in gorgonians (Coma et al., 1995; Tsounis et al., 2006; Ribes et al.,\n\n2007; Gori et al., ress), but also the general pattern for octocorals (Benayahu and Loya, 1984a),\n\nalcyonaceans and many scleractinians (Szmant, 1986). Several octocoral species keep immature\n\noocytes year-round, with a fraction maturing during a seasonal oogenic cycle, as for instance\n\nAcabaria biserialis (Ben-Yosef and Benayahu, 1999), Eunicella singularis, (Ribes et al., 2007; Gori\n\net al., ress) and Tripalea clavaria, (Excoffon et al., 2004, 2011). This pattern is consistent with\n\nthe theory that oogenesis is more energetically expensive than spermatogenesis (Kahng et al.,\n\n2011). On the other hand, in order to achieve synchronous spawning in both sexes, and thus to\n\nminimize the loss of gametes (Grosberg and Levitan, 1992; Lasker and Kim, 1996; Carlon, 1999;\n\nRitson-Williams et al., 2009), spermatogenesis has to be delayed (Coma et al., 1995; Tsounis et al.,\n\n2006; Gori et al., 2007, ress). The fact that spermatogenesis took longer than commonly found in\n\nother octocorals may be because the quantification of spermaries was undertaken in a microscope,\n\ninstead of a stereo microscope. High fecundity and volume of reproductive structures in both sexes\n\nsuggests that Eunicella gazella invests a lot of energy on sexual reproduction, a common strategy\n\n171\n\n\n\nPART III. REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF GORGONIANS IN THE ALGARVE COAST\n\nin other gorgonian species (Coma et al., 1995, 1998; Ribes et al., 2007; Linares et al., 2008a; Gori\n\net al., ress; Tsounis et al., 2012). Energy investment (i.e. volume of oocytes or spermaries) seems\n\nto be similar in both sexes, but males produce more structures. Therefore, it is possible that by\n\nincreasing the production of male gametes, Eunicella gazella is enhancing fertilization likelihood,\n\nas pointed by Coma et al. (1995) for Paramuricea clavata. The maximum size of mature oocytes is\n\nsimilar to those reported for other gorgonian species. Considering the high fecundity registered,\n\nthe investment in large oocytes (increasing longevity and allowing energy reserves for the zygote)\n\nmay be a strategy to improve fertilization success through increased sperm-egg encounter rates\n\n(Levitan, 1993), favouring broadcasting mode.\n\nThe investment in offspring is generally related to environmental conditions, being larger in less\n\nstable regions (e.g. temperate waters). Some studies mentioned that several gorgonians require a\n\npeak summer temperature above a certain threshold as a cue for spawning (Coma et al., 1995;\n\nGori et al., 2007; Pakes and Woollacott, 2008; De Putron and Ryland, 2009) and that temperature\n\nis the main factor synchronizing the development of reproductive structures (Gori et al., 2007).\n\nLong-lived species with slow oocyte development, such as octocorals, in areas with marked but\n\npredictable seasonal variation in food availability, tend to present gametogenic cycles that follow\n\nsuch variations (Coma et al., 1998; Gori et al., 2007, ress; Ribes et al., 2007, and references therein).\n\nSpatial and depth differences in the timing of spawning of gorgonian species have been attributed\n\nto differences in sea surface temperature, which may also be the reason why the spawning in\n\nEunicella gazella is delayed compared to Eunicella singularis in the Mediterranean (Gori et al.,\n\n2007; Ribes et al., 2007) and Eunicella verrucosa in the United Kingdom (Munro, 2004). Even\n\nthough the feeding habits of this species are unknown, temperate gorgonians feed mainly on\n\nzooplankton (copepods and nauplii) and POM (Coma et al., 1994; Ribes et al., 2003; Tsounis et al.,\n\n2005). For example, in the Mediterranean, Paramuricea clavata shows higher energy allocation for\n\nreproduction in March-June, when ingestion rates coupled with the spring bloom are higher, but\n\nalso presents increased feeding rates in November-December during the shorter autumn bloom\n\n(Coma et al., 1998). The energy surplus during periods of high food availability (winter and spring)\n\nare invested in secondary production (Coma et al., 1998). Similar models have been proposed for\n\nother gorgonian species feeding primarily on microzooplankton and POM (Ribes et al., 2007; Gori\n\net al., 2007, ress). Therefore, it is expectable that the reproductive cycle of Eunicella gazella should\n\nalso be regulated by food availability. After the spring bloom (March-April), Eunicella gazella\n\ntransfers the energy surplus to the intensive production and maturation of oocytes and spermaries,\n\nenhanced by the high summer temperatures, ending the cycle with the synchronised spawning\n\nby female and male colonies in September-October. The occurrence of a second phytoplankton\n\nbloom, and the frequent upwelling conditions, provide a relatively prolonged period of increased\n\nchlorophyll a and POC concentrations during autumn-winter. The fact that spawning occurs\n\nimmediately before this period of increased food availability suggests that this energetic surplus\n\nis crucial in the reproductive strategy of this species. Feeding and energetic studies may help to\n\n172\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5. REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF THE GORGONIAN : AN ORIGINALLY TROPICAL SPECIES DOMINATING\nSHALLOW ATLANTIC IBERIAN COASTS\n\ndiscern how Eunicella gazella uses the autumn bloom. According to the present study, production\n\nof new oocytes is not increased and sperm sacs are vestigial during this period, and the small\n\noocytes that were kept after spawning do not show signs of continuous maturation. The planulae\n\nof gorgonians with broadcast spawning usually take 4 to 15 days to settle (Table 3; Linares et al.,\n\n2008, and references therein), therefore increased food in autumn can be used by the recruits to\n\nenhance the initial phase after settlement.\n\n5.4.4. Conservation issues and knowledge gaps\n\nA trade-off between regeneration and reproduction has been reported for different coral species\n\n(Szmant, 1990; Van Veghel and Bak, 1994; Rinkevich, 1996; Ward et al., 2000), namely gorgonians\n\n(Linares et al., 2008a; Tsounis et al., 2012). Fecundity may be reduced in damaged parts of the\n\ncolony, but can also be extended far from the damaged area (Linares et al., 2008a). As a result,\n\nbesides their immediate impacts, disturbance events may also present delayed effects on the\n\nreproductive output of gorgonian species, therefore, affecting their long-term recovery (Tsounis\n\net al., 2006, 2012; Linares et al., 2008a). The samples analysed in the present study were collected\n\nin an area under high fishing pressure (C\u00fardia et al., 2sub) and a significant part of Eunicella gazella\n\npopulation presents tissue damage and consequent fouling by other biota (unpublished data).\n\nHowever, colonies presenting signs of damage or extensive fouling were not collected, in order\n\nto avoid introducing bias in this study on the reproductive cycle. Nevertheless, it is important to\n\ncompare the present data with that obtained in areas without or under lower pressure that can\n\naffect this gorgonian species. Moreover, the correlation between damage and fecundity should be\n\nanalysed in colonies from the same population, under similar environmental conditions. Spatial\n\nand temporal variations in fecundity should also be estimated for the area.\n\nIn the near future, the present study shall be complemented with studies performed during the\n\nspawning period, with short intervals between samples, aiming to confirm the broadcasting beha-\n\nviour and test the existence (and frequency) of brooding in this species. In addition, researchers\n\nshould develop specific sampling techniques to allow identifying larvae on/or in the vicinity of\n\ncolonies. The use of specifically designed collectors can also shed light on the type of spawning.\n\nRecruitment studies are also of utmost importance to understand how the larval supply is used in\n\nthe area, and what are the consequences for the dynamics, gene flow, and ultimately persistence\n\nof the species along time. The present data disclosed the general reproductive cycle of Eunicella\n\ngazella, providing baseline information for future studies focusing directly or indirectly on the\n\nreproduction of this habitat engineering long-lived suspension feeder.\n\n173\n\n\n\nPART III.

The preference\n\nof scuba divers for natural rocky areas with diverse fauna put these habitats under threat. The\n\nassessment of the impacts and their causes is therefore an important issue for the management of\n\ncoastal areas, particularly if they face multiple uses. In 2005-2007, during the summer season when\n\nscuba diving is more intense, 105 scuba divers were monitored while diving. Their behaviours, the\n\nconsequences of their actions and the associated impacts were recorded to estimate the impact of\n\nscuba divers in the habitat. Most of the scuba divers (88.6 %) showed behaviours that may impact\n\nmarine systems and the mean contact rate was 0.340 \u00b1 0.028 contacts min?1. The rate was higher\nin scuba divers with moderate experience, and in the initial part of the dive (0\u201310 min). Contacts\n\nwith fins and hands dominated, mainly resulting in sediment re-suspension, but the estimated\n\nimpacts associated were generally low. However, fauna was also affected by physical damage and\n\ninteractions, which may severely impact animals, especially suspension feeding sensitive species\n\nsuch as gorgonians. Based on the observed patterns, some ideas are discussed in order to reduce\n\nscuba diving impacts at local and global scales.\n\nKeywords: Scuba diving \u2022 impact \u2022 diver\u2019s experience \u2022 natural versus artificial habitats\n\n6.1. Introduction\n\nScuba diving is a growing activity worldwide (Davis and Tisdell, 1995; Harriott et al., 1997;\n\nBarker and Roberts, 2004; Davenport and Davenport, 2006). Mainland Portugal has attractive\n\nconditions for the development of this recreational activity, especially in its southern coast, the\n\nAlgarve, that showed in the recent years a sharp increase in the number of dives, certified divers\n\nand scuba diving centres (Santos et al., 2006). The Algarve region presents an offer of tourism-\n\nrelated products of excellence and natural conditions for sport tourism, and therefore in the near\n\nfuture the activity is expected to grow (Santos et al., 2006) as the local authorities are fostering\n\nthe diversification of tourism products, especially expanding activities that can be certified as\n\n\u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d and sustainable (Correia and Pires, 2006; Pires, 2008).\n\nScuba divers prefer and are willing to pay more to dive in sites with high biological diversity,\n\nhigh abundance of certain species (mainly fish) and high probability to observe large animals\n\n(Rudd and Tupper, 2002; Green and Donnelly, 2003; Dearden et al., 2007). In this context, habitats\n\nwith complex biological communities, significant ecological importance and a strong contribution\n\nfor marine biodiversity such as rocky areas in tempered waters, especially in marine protected\n\n184\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS\u2019 PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION\nFOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS\n\nareas (MPAs) (Milazzo et al., 2002; Coma et al., 2004; Luna et al., 2009) and coral reefs in tropical and\n\nsubtropical waters are highly demanded. Coral habitats in particular suffer high intensity of diving,\n\nespecially in the Red Sea (>250 000 dives yr?1 in Eilat, 12 km of coast; >30 000 dives yr?1 in Dahab;\n20 000 dives yr?1 per mooring buoy in Ras Mohammed National Park Medio et al., 1997; Zakai\n\nand Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Hasler and Ott, 2008)), the Grand Barrier Reef in Australia (10 000\u2013\n\n20 000 dives yr?1 Harriott et al., 1997) and the Caribbean (5000\u20136000 dives yr?1 Hawkins et al., 1999).\n\nThe rapid growth of scuba diving led to increasing concerns of the impacts of the activity all over\n\nthe world (Medio et al., 1997; Jameson et al., 1999; Tratalos and Austin, 2001; Coma et al., 2004)\n\nwhich adds to other existing threats. Rocky areas in tempered waters are also impacted by many\n\ndisturbance factors, mostly related to human activities such as urban development, fishing and\n\nrecreational activities (Crowe et al., 2000; Milazzo et al., 2002; Lloret and Riera, 2008), while coral\n\nreefs are severely threatened by overfishing, pollution, climate change and ocean acidification (e.g.\n\nHughes et al., 2003; Hoegh-Guldberg, 2010; Pandolfi et al., 2011), leading to phase shifts, spread of\n\ndiseases and decline of the high biodiversity typical of these habitats (e.g. Knowlton, 2001; Hughes\n\net al., 2007; Plaisance et al., 2011).\n\nSeveral studies were conducted to identify the impacts and calculate the carrying capacity\n\nof intensively used dive sites (e.g. Davis and Tisdell, 1995; Medio et al., 1997; Hawkins et al.,\n\n1999; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004). Even though considered an\n\n\u201cecofriendly\u201d activity, several impacts have been identified and associated to scuba diving leading\n\nto the degradation of marine ecosystems (e.g. Harriott et al., 1997; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman,\n\n2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004; Coma et al., 2004; Luna et al., 2009). In coral reefs, the coral cover\n\ndecreased in intensively dived areas due to total or partial mortality (Rouphael and Inglis, 1997;\n\nHawkins et al., 1999; Jameson et al., 1999; Tratalos and Austin, 2001; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman,\n\n2002; Hasler and Ott, 2008; Leujak and Ormond, 2008; Hannak et al., 2011). Although studies to\n\nassess the impacts of scuba diving in temperate waters are scarce (Garrabou et al., 1998; Coma\n\net al., 2004; Di Franco et al., 2009; Luna et al., 2009), damage in species characteristic of pre-\n\ncoralligenous, coralligenous and sciaphilous habitats have been found to be significant (Coma\n\net al., 2004; Luna-P\u00e9rez et al., 2010). Mitigation measures to reduce or alleviate those impacts\n\nhave been frequently suggested, constituting important tools for the management of dived areas\n\n(protected or not).\n\nIn the Algarve, shallow water subtidal rocky areas present a rich benthic community (Gon\u00e7alves\n\net al., 2007, 2010), with a mixed assemblage of gorgonian species standing out as important habitat\n\nformers and the most conspicuous fauna. These gorgonian gardens that enhance local biodiversity\n\nby harbouring a rich and diverse associated fauna (Carvalho et al., sub.) extend to deeper waters\n\nand have been recently proposed to be included in OSPAR\u2019s protected habitats (Anonymous, 2011).\n\nRocky areas with gorgonian gardens are attractive seascapes very popular among scuba divers\n\n185\n\n\n\nPART IV. HUMAN PRESSURES IN THE ALGARVE SUBLITTORAL ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\n(Rodrigues, 2008) and are therefore prone to impacts resulting from such activity. Also, dived\n\nareas, such as the Algarve coast, commonly serve multiple purposes such as fishing and boating,\n\nand are often the subject of stakeholders\u2019 conflicting interests. To properly manage multi-use\n\nareas it is important to understand and quantify the impacts of each use, namely scuba diving, in\n\norder to build management plans to restore the impacted areas and achieve a balance between\n\npreservation of biodiversity and resource utilization. The main goal of this study is to assess\n\nthe impact of scuba diving in the Algarve coast. Specific objectives are: i) estimate the rate\n\nof scuba divers\u2019 actions according to their diving experience; ii) to determine whether the rate\n\nof actions is similar along different diving time frames (10 min and 10\u201330 min); iii) to identify\n\nthe main actions performed by the scuba divers that interact with the environment and their\n\nimmediate consequences; and, iv) compare scuba divers\u2019 behaviour on rocky areas and wrecks.\n\nThe identification and quantification of the main actions and their consequences will be discussed\n\nconsidering their estimated impacts and strategies will be pointed out to prevent those actions and\n\nminimize their consequences. Conservation measures will be proposed and discussed according\n\nto the main facts observed.\n\n6.2. Materials and Methods\n\n6.2.1. Study area\n\nThe Algarve presents a large diversity of features within its coastal zone, from rocky cliffs\n\nsurrounding small bays to large sandy beaches with low slope and small scattered rocky areas or\n\nsubmerged fossilized ancient dunes. Furthermore, there are a few wrecks with differing ages that\n\ncurrently are used for scuba diving. The entire coastal zone is subjected to several anthropogenic\n\npressures, namely urban development for housing and tourism, intensive use of the areas for\n\nrecreational activities, boating and both sport and commercial fishing, the latter with a wide\n\nrange of fishing gears and techniques. The coastal zone of the Algarve is very productive due\n\nto seasonal upwelling and its marine communities are rich and diverse, benefiting from the\n\nconvergence of waters from different regions, namely the Mediterranean Sea, the North Atlantic\n\nand the Northwest coast of Africa (Cherubin et al., 2000; Martins et al., 2002; Souto et al., 2010; Levy\n\net al., 2011). Moreover, there are important transitional systems in the Algarve, namely estuarine-\n\nlagoon systems such as the Ria de Alvor and the Guadiana and barrier islands such as the Ria\n\nFormosa (Carvalho et al., in press) which have been extensively studied and proven to be important\n\nnursery areas (Abecasis et al., 2009; Vasconcelos et al., 2010, 2011). Despite the ecological relevance\n\nof the region, marine reserves have not yet been established in the Algarve coast and the strategy\n\nfor marine species and habitats protection is based on the Habitats Directive and Natura 2000.\n\n186\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS\u2019 PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION\nFOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS\n\n6.2.2. Sampling strategy\n\nIn order to estimate the impact of recreational scuba diving in the Algarve coast, scuba divers\n\nwere monitored underwater. The samples were collected during regular scuba diving trips of three\n\ndiving centres that participated in the study and are representative of the offer in the region. The\n\n23 diving sites that were considered fall into two different categories, rocky areas (subtidal rocky\n\nbottoms; 19 sites) and wrecks (shipwrecks and a World War II downed airplane; 4 sites). These\n\ncategories are representative of the Algarve diving areas with much more rocky sites than wrecks\n\n(Santos et al., 2006). Between 2005 and 2007, during the summer, 120 dives were monitored, but\n\nonly 105 of them proved to have the necessary requirements to be analysed with no bias, 76 in\n\nrocky areas and 29 in wreck areas.\n\nAll underwater surveys were carried out by the same two observers ( J. C\u00fardia and M. Ferreira).\n\nPreliminary surveys were performed to define sampling strategy, set the criteria for actions,\n\nconsequences and impacts, and to check sampling consistency. These surveys indicated that it was\n\nimpracticable to record the exact timing of each action, therefore two time frames were defined:\n\nthe first 10 min of the dive (starting from the moment that the scuba diver reached the seafloor\n\nand started the recreational dive) and the following 10\u201330 min. It was also defined that after the\n\n30 min of dive, the contacts, actions, consequences and impacts continued to be monitored until\n\nthe end of the recreational dive (i.e. whenever the dive leader or any of the dive buddies declared\n\nthat the dive had finished and divers should start to ascend) and the total dive time was annotated.\n\nFurthermore, because of local oceanographic conditions, namely reduced visibility, each observer\n\nwas only able to monitor one or two different divers in each dive. The sets of data from both\n\nobservers after some dives were found to be very similar, allowing the comparison of data collected\n\nby both observers, assuming negligible bias. The criteria used in assessing the impacts were set\n\naccording to the preliminary surveys and published information (Figure 6.1). The actions that\n\nwere ranked as having higher impact were those that introduced any kind of stress to animals, or\n\nsignificantly harmed the biological entities or its habitat. The actions that produced no observable\n\nconsequence were rated as low impact actions.\n\nInformation regarding the experience and certification level of the scuba divers was collected by\n\ninformally inquiring scuba divers and diving centres\u2019 staff. Three levels of diving experience were\n\ndefined: low (less than 20 dives), moderate (20\u201350 dives) and high (more than 50 dives). During\n\npre-dive briefing all the scuba divers in each diving trip were informed that the observers were\n\nconducting surveys to identify marine fauna and therefore would take notes during the dive. For\n\neach diver the actions and behaviours were recorded, as well as the immediate consequence of the\n\nscuba diver action. The impact of the consequence was assessed \u201cin situ\u201d in real time according\n\nto the previously set of criteria (Figure 6.1). In the post-dive, generally, the scuba divers were\n\ncurious about the number of species identified and whether they have seen the same species. The\n\n187\n\n\n\nPART IV.

SCUBA DIVERS\u2019 PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION\nFOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS\n\nobservers described briefly the main observed species and alerted for extra caution, especially\n\ntowards some focal species, and for the correct behaviour while diving (e.g. avoid the interaction\n\nwith species, no feeding). Due to diving constraints (divers got lost, gear malfunction, etc...) some\n\ndives were not used for the analysis as they were significantly biased. Divers that got aware of the\n\nobservers\u2019 purposes were also excluded from the analysis. The 105 dives used in the current work\n\nall correspond to valid samples.\n\n6.2.3. Statistical analyses\n\nContact rates were defined in the present work as the number of contacts performed by the\n\nscuba diver in a determined period of time. The different time frames sampled have different\n\n(and variable) duration (10 min, 20 min, 0\u201330 min), therefore data was standardised for time units\n\n(i.e. contacts min?1). Contact rates data did not show a normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n\ntest), consequently non-parametric tests were used to test the significance of the differences\n\nbetween groups of samples. The contact rates for different experience levels were compared for\n\neach diving site category (rocky areas vs. wrecks) using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test (paired\n\ntests). For the contact rates of different periods of the dive (initial 10 min, 10\u201330 min, block data)\n\nthe Friedman test was used (Legendre and Legendre, 1998; Barker and Roberts, 2004).\n\n6.3. Results\n\n6.3.1. Scuba diver characterization\n\nIn the present work, the study subjects (divers) were generally men (81.6 %, significant deviance\n\nfrom the a 0.5 ratio, p &lt;0.001, binomial test). Most divers were between 20\u201340 yr old, and only\na few subjects were more than 50 yr old. Samples included tourists visiting the Algarve, both\n\nnational and international visitors, and local scuba divers, mostly regular customers of the diving\n\ncentres. National citizens accounted for 67.0 % of the studied subjects, a percentage that does not\n\nagree with the expected ratio for Algarve (4 Portuguese: 6 Foreigner, unpublished data; p &lt;0.001,\nbinomial test) based on data gathered from unofficial enquiries (Santos et al., 2006). The logistic\n\nconstraints (64 dives in Faro, 22 dives in Vilamoura and 18 dives in Lagos) may have also influenced\n\nthese numbers as the diving centre from Lagos estimates that around 95 % of their divers are\n\nfrom foreign countries, whereas the other two centres, estimate around 10 % (Faro) and 50 %\n\n(Vilamoura). Nevertheless, the authors are convinced that the used dataset is representative of the\n\nscuba diving market in the Algarve typically with a strong spatial and seasonal variation (Santos\n\net al., 2006).\n\n189\n\n\n\nPART IV. HUMAN PRESSURES IN THE ALGARVE SUBLITTORAL ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\n6.3.2. Scuba diver\u2019s interactions\n\nOverall, 93 of the 105 observed divers (88.6 %) made one or more contacts during their dive.\n\nFrom the 93 divers with contacts, 34 of them made up to 5 contacts in a single dive, and 55\n\nmade 10 or less contacts. However, 37 divers presented between 11and30 contacts and one\n\nscuba diver presented 54 contacts in a single dive (60 min). Overall, the mean contact rate was\n\n0.340 \u00b1 0.028 contacts min?1 (\u00b1SE) and the median was 0.27 contacts min?1. The distribution\nof contact rates at rocky areas and wrecks was not normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n\ntest, p &lt;0.05) but skewed towards low rates (skewness, 0.92 and 1.21, respectively) consistently\nresulting in lower median values than the mean contact rates at both dive site types (Table 6.1).\n\nMost of the divers made contacts, independently of dive site type (rocky areas and wrecks) and\n\nexperience level (low, moderate and high experience) (Figure 6.2).\n\nTable 6.1.: Contact rates for rocky and wreck scuba divers in the Algarve, discriminated by experience and\ntime of the dive.

SCUBA DIVERS\u2019 PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION\nFOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS\n\nFigure 6.2.: Number of scuba divers showing contacts in relation to the total number of sampled scuba\ndivers discriminated by diving experience for rocky areas and wrecks.\n\n6.3.3. Factors influencing the rate of contacts\n\nIn general, the rate of contacts by scuba divers was higher in the initial part of the dive (10 min)\n\nthan in the middle/final part of the dive (Table 6.1 and Figure 6.3). In fact, of the 105 divers\n\nanalysed only 19 increased the number of contacts after the initial 10 min of the dive, most of them\n\npresenting low contact rates (13 divers under 0.2 contacts min?1.)\n\nIn rocky areas, moderate and high experience divers, showed significantly higher contact\n\nrates in the initial 10 min of the dive (Friedman test, ?2 = 7.14, p &lt;0.01 and 17.19, p &lt;0.001,\nrespectively; Table 6.1 and Figure 6.3). Noteworthy, in the initial 10 min of the dive in rocky areas,\n\nhigh experience divers showed the lowest rates (0.40 contacts min?1) whereas the highest rates\n\n(0.60 contacts min?1) were from moderate experience divers.\n\nIn the wreck areas, the contact rates were generally higher in the initial part of the dive (10 min)\n\nfor all experience levels. However, contact rates were only significantly higher in the initial part\n\nof the dive (10 min) for moderate experience divers (Friedman test ?2 = 6.23, p &lt;0.05; Table 6.1\nand Figure 6.3). For low and high experience levels, the differences between contact rates were\n\nnot found significant, because of the small number of samples (low power of the test) and the high\n\nvariability in wrecks\u2019 data. Similarly to rocky areas, high experienced divers presented the lowest\n\nrates (median 0.15 contacts min?1) and moderate experienced divers the highest rates (median\n\n0.50 contacts min?1) in the first 10 min of the dive.\n\n191\n\n\n\nPART IV.

SCUBA DIVERS\u2019 PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION\nFOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS\n\nContact rates (total dive, 0\u201310 min and 10\u201330 min) generally decreased with increasing exper-\n\nience of the diver (Table 6.1). However, only the difference in the contact rates of the initial part\n\nof the dive (0\u201310 min) of moderate and high experience levels of wreck divers were found to be\n\nsignificant (Wilcoxon test, z = ?0.72, p &lt;0.01). Contact rates in rocky areas were generally higher\nthan in wrecks, but no significant differences were found when comparing the two types of dive\n\nsites (Wilcoxon test, p > 0.05).\n\n6.3.4. Impacts on marine ecosystem\n\nThe vast majority of \u201ccontacts\u201d that were observed during the surveys were physical con-\n\ntacts with the substrate and marine organisms (mostly unintentional) and only a few cases\n\nof interactions with biota (97.1 % vs. 2.9 %). In rocky areas, 52.5 % of the contacts were fins\n\ntouching the substrate or organisms, 23.0 % were hand contacts, 14.3 % were body contacts\n\n(Figure 6.4) and 7.4 % were gear contacts. Interactions with fauna were rare (2.7 %). A different\n\npattern was observed in wreck areas mainly because contacts were made primarily using hands\n\n(48.6 %), followed by fins (22.4 %) whereas gear, body and interactions with fauna presented similar\n\npercentages to those observed in rocky areas (Figure 6.4).\n\nBoth at rocky areas and wrecks, it was impossible to discern any immediate consequence of a\n\nlarge quantity of the contacts (Unidentified, 58.4 % and 73.3 %, respectively). On the other hand,\n\nsome of the contacts had a clear consequence. The most frequent case at both dive site types\n\nwas the re-suspension of sediment (raising sediment, 29.0 % and 14.8 %, respectively), whereas\n\nthe remaining actions and their consequences directly involved the biota living at the seafloor. In\n\nrocky areas, a total of 103 contacts with marine species were made and had different consequences,\n\nnamely the disturbance of fauna (mainly fish, cephalopods and crustaceans; 4.5 %), contacts with\n\ncolonial invertebrates without breakage (contact with fauna, 3.5 %), contacts with macroalgae\n\n(contact with flora, 3.1 %), breaking of colonial benthic species (gorgonians and bryozoans, 1.3 %)\n\nand a single event of fish feeding.\n\nRegarding the possible effects of the contacts on the habitat as a whole, both at rocky areas\n\nand wrecks, most were rated by the observers as low (74.2 % and 86.7 %, respectively) and a\n\ntotal of 21 contacts were considered as having a high potential to harm the marine environment\n\nwith similar percentages at both dive site types. The relative percentage of contacts presenting\n\nmoderate impact was two times higher for rocky areas than for wreck areas (23.7 % and 11.4 %,\n\nrespectively). Actions rated as low impact were the contacts with macroalgae and sediment re-\n\nsuspension (88.0 % and 68.6 %, respectively) as most of the contacts which were classified as\n\nundetermined due to observation constraints (Unidentified; 84.5 %). On the other hand, organism\n\nbreakage, disturbance and contacts with fauna were primarily associated to moderate and/or high\n\n193\n\n\n\nPART IV. HUMAN PRESSURES IN THE ALGARVE SUBLITTORAL ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\nFigure 6.4.: Comparison of the relative distribution of actions in the two types diving sites.\n\nimpacts (63.6 %, 52.7 % and 47.2 %, respectively; Figure 6.5). Moderate/high impact events were\n\nmore frequent in rocky areas, such as organism breakage (not observed at wrecks) and fauna\n\ndisturbance were more frequent in rocky areas (Figure 6.5). The latter consisted mainly on scuba\n\ndivers harassing the marine fauna, namely chasing fish and cephalopods, distressing octopus or\n\ncryptic fish species in their hides and holding echinoderms or other invertebrates.\n\n6.4. Discussion\n\nDiving has been frequently associated to habitat degradation, with higher damage levels in\n\ndived sites than in nearby non visited sites (Hawkins et al., 1999; Tratalos and Austin, 2001; Hasler\n\nand Ott, 2008). In coral reef areas, the coral cover decreased in sites intensively dived (Tratalos\n\nand Austin, 2001; Hasler and Ott, 2008) and damage especially of massive and branching corals is\n\nhigh (Hawkins et al., 1999; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Hasler and Ott, 2008; Leujak and\n\nOrmond, 2008).\n\nMost impacts result from direct contacts with the fins to the substrate and marine fauna\n\n(Rouphael and Inglis, 1997, 2001; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004;\n\nUyarra and Cot\u00e9, 2007; Leujak and Ormond, 2008), which was confirmed in the present study.\n\nContacts with hands were also frequently observed, as it has also been reported elsewhere,\n\n194\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS\u2019 PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION\nFOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS\n\nFigure 6.5.: Main consequences of the contacts of scuba divers. Number of contacts are presented for rocky\nareas and wrecks, discriminating impact grades (low, medium and high).\n\n195\n\n\n\nPART IV. HUMAN PRESSURES IN THE ALGARVE SUBLITTORAL ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\nespecially in coral reefs (Rouphael and Inglis, 1997; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Barker\n\nand Roberts, 2004; Uyarra and Cot\u00e9, 2007; Leujak and Ormond, 2008; Luna et al., 2009). Hand\n\ncontacts dominated in wreck areas, most of them intentional contacts conducted by moderate\n\nexperience divers, probably because these scuba divers actively search for objects and fauna\n\n(entrances, holes). Active search for some animals, especially cryptic species, has been found to\n\ndramatically increase the rate of contacts and the damage inflicted to the benthic environment\n\n(Uyarra and Cot\u00e9, 2007). Nevertheless, in the present study, intentional contacts to interact with\n\nfauna accounted for less than 5 % at both rocky areas and wrecks.\n\nThe main impacts on the environment (mainly on local fauna) resulting from contacts with the\n\nfins were the re-suspension of sediment and the subsequent persistence of nepheloid layers, as\n\nwell as the physical contacts with fauna (with different outcomes, e.g. breakage, tissue abrasion).\n\nIndeed, occurrence of nepheloid layers may lead fish and motile invertebrates to avoid the area\n\nand affect suspension-feeding sessile organisms such as gorgonians (Sala et al., 1996; Garrabou\n\net al., 1998; Milazzo et al., 2002; Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Airoldi, 2003; Balata et al.,\n\n2005; Leujak and Ormond, 2008; Luna-P\u00e9rez et al., 2011) and ascidians (Luna-P\u00e9rez et al., 2010,\n\n2011). Direct contacts to the fauna may damage important habitat building species, such as stony\n\ncorals, gorgonians, sponges and bryozoans, significantly contributing to habitat deterioration\n\n(Sala et al., 1996; Garrabou et al., 1998; Hawkins et al., 1999; Coma et al., 2004; Uyarra and Cot\u00e9,\n\n2007; Hasler and Ott, 2008; Leujak and Ormond, 2008; Di Franco et al., 2009). In this study, we\n\nobserved scuba divers unintentionally breaking, sometimes extensively, large bryozoans such as\n\nPentapora fascialis. These fragile colonial organisms are frequently damaged in intensively used\n\ndive sites resulting in important effects in density, size and coverage, altering the structure of this\n\nspecies\u2019 populations (Sala et al., 1996; Garrabou et al., 1998). Although this species is known to\n\nrecover rapidly from disturbance (Coma et al., 2004) it has potential as an indicator for scuba diving\n\nimpacts.\n\nThe most conspicuous fauna in dived areas of the Algarve is, however, a mixed assemblage of\n\ngorgonian species, especially Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa, Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa (C\u00fardia et al., sub.a). Although not very frequent, trampling\n\nover gorgonians was observed in the present study, with consequent damage to gorgonian tissues\n\nand leading to partial mortality and breakage. Partial mortality in gorgonians results in reduced\n\ngrowth and reproductive effort and to a higher risk of predation and colonization by epifauna\n\n(Coma et al., 2004; Linares et al., 2008c). In the Algarve, gorgonians are among the largest benthic\n\nanimals, providing habitat for other species and enhancing local biodiversity (Carvalho et al.,\n\nsub.). These long-lived animals have typically low recruitment rates, low growth and long turnover-\n\ntimes (Mistri and Ceccherelli, 1994; Coma et al., 1998a, 2004; Linares et al., 2008b). Consequently,\n\ndamage produced by diver contact becomes a more severe and chronic disturbance due to low\n\nrecoverability (Coma et al., 2004; Di Franco et al., 2009; Luna-P\u00e9rez et al., 2010).\n\n196\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS\u2019 PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION\nFOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS\n\nInteractions with fauna (chasing fish, playing with seastars, octopus and cuttlefish) may also\n\nresult in moderate to high impacts on local fauna, as stress resulting from the interactions\n\nmay increase the probability of animals being predated, cause energy waste and disrupt crucial\n\nphases of species\u2019 biological cycles (Frid and Dill, 2002; MacFarlane and King, 2002; Chuchman,\n\n2006; Cubero-Pardo et al., 2011; Teresa et al., 2011), namely spawning (Heyman et al., 2010).\n\nFurthermore, some species (e.g. groupers) are more sensitive than others (e.g. snappers) and daily\n\nvisits by scuba divers of a \u201cpermanent\u201d spawning aggregation site can create sufficient disturbance\n\nfor fish species to move to other areas (Heyman et al., 2010). Another common interaction with\n\nfauna (yet rarely observed in this study) is fish feeding which has been proved to affect directly and\n\nindirectly the structure of coastal fish assemblages (Milazzo et al., 2005, 2006; Ilarri et al., 2008).\n\nThe extremely low frequency of fish feeding in the present study probably resulted from a general\n\nawareness of the diving centres that systematically advise divers on the detrimental effects of fish\n\nfeeding.\n\nEven though scuba diving is a rather small industry in the Algarve, its growth in the past few\n\nyears and the national and regional strategy to maintain tourism as an important source of income\n\nfor the region (Anonymous, 2006; Correia and Pires, 2006), suggests that the pressure on the marine\n\necosystem posed by this recreational activity may increase rapidly. Moreover, considering that 15 %\n\nof the divers do moderate/high impact contacts with rates above 1.5 contacts 10 min?1 the threats\n\nto marine habitats will increase.\n\nThe main conclusions of the present study are:\n\n1. experienced divers present lower contact rates than moderate and low experienced divers\n\n(specialization matters)\n\n2. contact rates are highest in the initial part of the dive (time matters)\n\n3. contact rates in wrecks are lower than in natural rocky areas and\n\n4. most contacts in natural rocky areas are fin contacts whereas in wrecks hand contacts\n\ndominate (dive site types present different diving profiles)\n\nFacing these main findings, some measures can be applied in order to prevent and/or reduce\n\nthe damage inflicted to marine communities. As increased knowledge and skills (specialization)\n\nare determinant for changing the behaviour of scuba divers, improved diver training is a key\n\nfactor to minimise their negative impacts on the seafloor (Thapa et al., 2005, 2006; Ong and\n\nMusa, 2011). Specialization should be reinforced by educational programs that can be formulated\n\nby various stakeholders (e.g. marine conservation organizations, governmental agencies and\n\nthe diving industry) (Thapa et al., 2006; Pepe, 2010; Ong and Musa, 2011). Environmental\n\n197\n\n\n\nPART IV. HUMAN PRESSURES IN THE ALGARVE SUBLITTORAL ROCKY BOTTOMS\n\nawareness influences the scuba divers\u2019 behaviour (Ong and Musa, 2011), therefore educational and\n\ncertification programmes should include elements on general marine conservation issues and on\n\nthe environmental impact of diving (e.g. videos of scuba divers\u2019 actions and their consequences)\n\nwhich may eventually build a responsible diving behaviour (Rouphael and Inglis, 1997; Zakai and\n\nChadwick-Furman, 2002; Thapa et al., 2006; Dearden et al., 2007; Pepe, 2010; Ong and Musa, 2011).\n\nThese programs should emphasize positive actions to preserve the marine ecosystem advising\n\non good-practise and code of conduct during dives and promoting continued education and\n\n\u201ceco-friendly\u201d social activities (Thapa et al., 2006; Ong and Musa, 2011), instead of focusing on\n\npenalties, boundaries and prohibited activities (Ong and Musa, 2011). Pre- and post-dive briefing\n\nsessions, conducted by a divemaster have been strongly recommended (Rouphael and Inglis,\n\n1997; Schleyer and Tomalin, 2000; Thapa et al., 2006; Dearden et al., 2007; Ong and Musa, 2011)\n\nand proven to be successful at reducing impacts (Medio et al., 1997; Barker and Roberts, 2004;\n\nUyarra and Cot\u00e9, 2007). But the content of the session should extend beyond rules, regulations\n\nand safety procedures, providing information about diving sites, particular features of the aquatic\n\nenvironment (including marine life), diving conditions or needed diving skills needed (Ong and\n\nMusa, 2011). Experienced scuba divers tend to erroneously perceive that the amount of damage\n\nthey may cause is relatively minor and, therefore, are less likely to modify their own behaviour\n\n(Rouphael and Inglis, 2001). In this regard, briefings are likely to be more effective if they\n\nemphasize the potential for cumulative impacts as a result of the sum of relatively minor effects\n\nof many individual divers and/or successive dives (Rouphael and Inglis, 2001). A diving code\n\nof conduct can be integrated by dive masters and instructors into pre-dive briefings and other\n\ndiving courses which may help to reinforce the importance of ethics and responsible behaviour\n\n(Thapa et al., 2006). It is important to emphasize that the training of divemasters and instructors\n\nis also fundamental to achieve this goal. The intervention of divemasters to alert and correct\n\nunintentional/intentional behaviours proved to be significant at reducing the number of contacts,\n\nand therefore at reducing the scuba diving impacts on marine habitats (Medio et al., 1997; Luna\n\net al., 2009). Therefore, as suggested elsewhere, all dives should be guided by trained divemasters\n\nor dive guides (Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004; Luna et al., 2009).\n\nTheir example in keeping hands and equipment away from the substrate and vigilance especially\n\nat the beginning of dives and towards the users of special equipment (cameras, flash-lights) or\n\ndives (night dives), may significantly reduce the impacts (Barker and Roberts, 2004). Small groups\n\nare advisable as this will ease the ability of dive leaders to perform their supervisory role (Rudd and\n\nTupper, 2002; Barker and Roberts, 2004).\n\nTaking into account that impacts were higher at the initial part of the dive and in natural\n\nrocky areas than in wrecks, carefully planning of scuba diving trails and starting the dive in\n\nareas with lower benthic cover are good measures to reduce the number of contacts. Locating\n\ntraining courses and introductory dives in sandy areas or nearby artificial reefs is also advisable\n\nas, whenever possible, recreational diver pressure must be diverted away from natural coral reefs\n\n198\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6. SCUBA DIVERS\u2019 PROFILE AND THEIR IMPACTS ON THE BENTHIC ENVIRONMENT: A CONTRIBUTION\nFOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MULTIUSE COASTAL AREAS\n\nto artificial reef areas (Zakai and Chadwick-Furman, 2002; Hasler and Ott, 2008). In the Algarve,\n\nscuba divers prefer to dive in preserved natural reefs looking to observe unusual fish or other less\n\ncommon aquatic organism, but they also state a high preference for wrecks, namely those with\n\narchaeological interest and sunken vessels (Ramos et al., 2006). In addition, the data presented\n\nhere suggests that in wrecks, contact rates are generally lower, globally reducing the impacts of\n\nscuba diving. However, due to the relatively low number of samples (29) data should be addressed\n\nwith caution. Ships have been sunk worldwide to enhance the scuba diving market at the local level\n\n(Abelson, 2006; Seaman, 2007) and their economic value has already been documented (Morgan\n\nand Massey, 2009, and references therein). However, the medium/long term effects of sinking\n\ndecommissioned vessels are poorly studied. Despite the preparation that is usually involved in\n\nthe process, degradation of vessel materials and leakage may increase concentrations of hazard\n\nmaterials and result in contamination, and other possible negative impacts such as community\n\nstructure shifts in fish and macrobenthic assemblages (attraction of fish species) and spread of\n\ninvasive species (Johnston et al., 2003, 2005; Davis et al., 2007; Glasby et al., 2007). Therefore,\n\nsinking vessels for scuba diving must be carefully planned to predict environmental hazards\n\nand when implemented, long-term monitoring using multidisciplinary approaches is strongly\n\nrecommended.\n\nIt is important to integrate legal, scientific and management tools in order to build robust\n\nconservation plans. In more sensitive areas, diving can be restricted to experienced divers and/or\n\ndiving quotas may be applied to reduce impacts (Luna et al., 2009). Research should be carried out\n\nto investigate the benthic community vulnerability and resilience and assess sensitivity to diving\n\nimpacts (Lloret et al., 2006). Also, monitoring programmes (Milazzo et al., 2002) using vulnerable\n\nor sensitive species (e.g. gorgonians and bryozoans) as focal species should be implemented to\n\nassess the success of management measures (Garrabou et al., 1998; Coma et al., 2004; Di Franco\n\net al., 2009; Luna-P\u00e9rez et al., 2010, 2011).\n\nThe estimated number of 5390 divers using scuba diving centres in the area (for the year 2004,\n\nSantos et al., 2006) is much lower than the estimated 11 200 divers yr?1 of the Parque Marinho Lu\u00eds\n\nSaldanha, the most important diving location in Portugal (Rodrigues, 2008) and also lower than\n\nthe mean 7123 divers yr?1 of European MPAs (Roncin et al., 2008), and may be lower than the\n\ncarrying capacity of the system. The Algarve coast yields attractive habitats of high biodiversity\n\nand ecological importance, harbouring vulnerable benthic fauna and it is subjected to multiple\n\npurposes. The main results of this study suggest that these focal points should be addressed with\n\ncaution and used to define the guidelines for carrying capacity estimation in the region. As pointed\n\nout by Luna et al. (2009, see references therein) scuba diving carrying capacity vary extensively\n\nbetween different sites/areas around the world, due to several factors, such as physical conditions,\n\nnatural disturbance events, biological communities in the area and anthropogenic pressures. As a\n\nconsequence, the real carrying capacity of the system is dynamic and any measure to be used for\n\n199\n\n\n\nPART IV.

Conclusions\n\nEcological relevance of gorgonian gardens\n\nShallow water gorgonian assemblages in Southern Portugal are mainly characterized by a co-\n\ndominance of several species (Eunicella labiata, Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa, Leptogorgia\n\nlusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa) that do not compete themselves for space but, because of\n\ndifferent habitat requirements or preferences, occupy different niches. Leptogorgia sarmentosa,\n\nfor example, is mainly found in areas where the re-suspension of sediments is common, whereas\n\nLeptogorgia lusitanica is frequently observed in places with stronger currents (vertical walls) and\n\nopen spaces with low sedimentation (terraces).\n\nThe abundance of gorgonians increases with depth showing a negative correlation with erect\n\nalgae. The abundance of algae generally decreases with depth because light is a limiting factor, and\n\nthe benthic cover becomes dominated by animals probably due to lower competition for space\n\nwith algae. On the other hand, a positive correlation between the abundance of gorgonians and\n\nthe abundance of sponges (Porifera) was observed. Because of their quasi bi-dimensional erect\n\nshape, gorgonians do not occupy a large space in the substratum, which may be used by other\n\nbenthic groups such as sponges, bryozoans, other cnidarians or coralline algae, maximizing space\n\noccupancy, heterogeneity and complexity of the sea-bottoms, and ultimately biodiversity.\n\nColonies of Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia lusitanica in the studied sites presented a diverse\n\n(11 phyla, 181 taxa) and abundant (7284 individuals) associated fauna, numerically dominated\n\nby amphipods but with polychaetes contributing the most to diversity. The analysis of diversity\n\npatterns, within and between gorgonian hosts, at both spatial and temporal scales, showed that\n\nthese two gorgonians were somehow complementary to the biodiversity of the habitat as a whole.\n\nGorgonian host, colony size and time were the most important factors in determining high levels of\n\ndiversity. The results suggest that biodiversity patterns are better defined by differences in relative\n\nabundances rather than in species composition. Even though the ecological function of both\n\nspecies is not entirely redundant, each adding new niches to the system and supporting attendant\n\nassemblages, the two gorgonians (all colonies pooled) shared most of the species collected, and\n\nonly 11 and 18 mostly rare or uncommon taxa were exclusively associated with Eunicella gazella\n\nand Leptogorgia lusitanica, respectively (excluding singletons). The abundant unidentified white\n\nflatworms (Turbellaria) in Eunicella gazella colonies was the only exclusive species to show a\n\nsignificant association to its host which may be explained by crypsis with the white colour of the\n\ngorgonian branches.\n\nThe differences in attendant assemblages, were partially explained by species-specific attrib-\n\n210\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nutes (size, complexity, lacunarity) but the main structuring factor appears to be the presence and\n\nfouling level of colonial epibionts (e.g. hydrozoans, sponges) and algae. Possibly due to a trophic\n\neffect (direct or indirect enhancement of food availability) combined with surface availability for\n\ncolonization (species-area effect), \u201ccolonial epibiont cover\u201d was the strongest predictor of species\n\nrichness and abundance of gorgonians\u2019 attendant assemblages. Moreover, the validity of the\n\nparadigm that structural complexity enhances biodiversity may be scale-dependent and, in the\n\ncase of gorgonians, the effect of complexity at the \u201cgarden\u201d level may be much more relevant than\n\nat the individual colony level. These findings reinforce the need for the conservation of gorgonian\n\naggregation areas as a whole in order to preserve host diversity and size structure.\n\nLife history\n\nShifts, resulting from disturbance or protection, may lead to different effects in species with\n\ndifferent traits (Halpern and Warner, 2002; Claudet et al., 2010), therefore the knowledge on the life\n\nhistory and traits of species, especially those more vulnerable to impacts is extremely important\n\nfor marine conservation. Longevity, time to maturity, reproductive mode, fecundity and propagule\n\ndispersal are some examples of traits conditioning the distribution patterns and the population\n\ndynamics of marine benthic species (Bremner, 2008), especially because of the importance of the\n\nearliest life history stage (egg or larva in gorgonians) (e.g. Linares et al., 2007, 2008b; Cowen and\n\nSponaugle, 2009).\n\nThe oogenic cycle of Eunicella gazella is long (over one year), with colonies presenting high\n\nfertility and spawning of mature oocytes occurring in September/October. The spermatogenic\n\ncycle occurs over a shorter period of time (eight to ten months), but maturation and spawning\n\nof both sexes is highly synchronized. Temperature seems to govern the maturation of gonads,\n\nprobably being related both to metabolic efficiency and food availability. Broadcast spawning is\n\npreliminarily pointed out as the mode of reproduction but more studies are needed in order to\n\nfully understand this reproductive feature. However, the study on the gametogenesis of Eunicella\n\ngazella does shed light on the reproductive pattern of one of the most abundant and common\n\ngorgonian species of the Algarve, but for which no data was available on any reproductive aspect.\n\nEven though the present study could not find a clear effect of colony size on fertility, further\n\nstudies should be specifically designed to ascertain this issue. The gametogenic cycle of other\n\nspecies that are frequent and abundant should also be studied, especially for Eunicella labiata\n\nand Leptogorgia lusitanica, as reproductive data on these species is entirely missing. On the other\n\nhand, Leptogorgia sarmentosa and Eunicella verrucosa, should also be studied as the information\n\navailable to the moment is still scarce (a single study for each species).\n\n211\n\n\n\nGORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION\n\nImpacts\n\nDespite the high biodiversity associated with gorgonians, they are subjected to several pres-\n\nsures. The present study presents evidence that the population structure of gorgonian assemblages\n\nalong the southern coast of the Algarve, can be related not only to differences in the physical\n\ncharacteristics of each area but also to the natural and anthropogenic pressures that act specifically\n\nupon them. In the case of anthropogenic pressures, fishing is pointed as the most probable\n\ndamaging factor, as all the remaining activities do not seem to have broad regional differences.\n\nIn disturbed areas (due to fishing and/or frequent sedimentation) gorgonian populations were\n\ndominated by small-sized colonies, clearly different from the population structure of areas under\n\nlower disturbance. Because several biological processes are density-dependent or size-dependent\n\n(e.g. Kapela and Lasker, 1999; Vermeij and Sandin, 2008; Tanner et al., 2009; Forrester et al.,\n\n2010), this information is of utmost importance for the study of those processes. On the other\n\nhand, damage in gorgonian colonies in fishing areas was commonly observed (broken colonies;\n\nentangled nets, angling lines and cables from cages; recently detached colonies with different\n\ndamage levels implying frequent disturbance) and sometimes extensive. Indeed, preliminary\n\nresults concerning damage assessment in gorgonian colonies along the Algarve southern coastal\n\nwaters further support the assumption that fishing may exert a high pressure on gorgonian\n\nassemblages. In two natural reef areas with high fishing intensity, Pedra da Greta and Pedra\n\ndo Barril, colony damage (fouling, denuded axis, breakage; estimated underwater) was assessed\n\nin gorgonian colonies of Leptogorgia lusitanica, Leptogorgia sarmentosa, Eunicella gazella and\n\nEunicella labiata. It was found that the percentage of damaged colonies was high at both sites\n\nand all species, ranging from 81.3 to 100 %. However, some differences were found between\n\nthe two genera, with Leptogorgia species being mainly characterized by small damaged colony\n\nareas, whereas Eunicella colonies were extensively damaged (see Figure C.1). The Leptogorgia\n\nwere mainly damaged in the tips of the colonies, probably due to abrasion with seafloor or other\n\nbiota as they are very flexible, presenting low percentage of broken colonies, 5.5\u20139.6 % and 18.8\u2013\n\n25.0 % for Pedra da Greta and Pedra do Barril, respectively. This kind of colony structure copes well\n\nwith trampling from fishing traps, for example, because as soon as the gear is hauled the colony\n\nreverts to its upright position. On the other hand, Eunicella colonies presented extensive fouling\n\nby algae (mainly in the tips), bryozoans, barnacles and anemones and were frequently entangled in\n\nfishing gears. Furthermore, a large proportion of the sampled colonies were broken (12.9\u201350.0 %),\n\nespecially Eunicella labiata that showed 43.3 and 50.0 % of broken colonies in Pedra do Barril and\n\nPedra da Greta, respectively. Contrastingly, underwater observations in areas under lower fishing\n\nintensity suggested that gorgonians present much lower damage rates and the extension of lesions\n\nis also much lower.\n\nFor several decades tourism has been increasing in the Algarve region and scuba diving is\n\n212\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFigure C.1.: Histogram of the percentage of damaged colony area for Eunicella gazella, Eunicella labiata,\nLeptogorgia lusitanica and Leptogorgia sarmentosa.\n\none of the recreational activities which promotes a particularly direct interaction with gorgonian\n\ngardens. However, at least regarding scuba diving, at present levels, this activity does not seem to\n\ncompromise gorgonian assemblages. The present study indicates that scuba divers in the Algarve\n\nmake contacts to the seafloor and benthic biota, impacting marine rocky habitats, especially\n\nin the initial part of the dive. Even though the impacts are generally low, the increasing trend\n\nof the activity in the region may lead to greater impacts. What is more, some of the impacts\n\npresent high damage, such as breakage of sessile benthic organisms. This is particularly important\n\nwhen the affected organisms are ecologically important (habitat formers) but characterized by low\n\nrecruitment rates, low growth, long lifespan and long turnover-times, such as gorgonians. In these\n\ncases, regeneration may impair for example growth and reproduction, leading to more severe and\n\nchronic disturbance effects due to low recoverability.\n\nC.2. Final remarks\n\nThe joint effect of small-sized dominated colonies in disturbed areas and the fact that the\n\nenhancement of biodiversity promoted by gorgonians is size-dependent, the reduction of gor-\n\ngonian populations and the shift towards smaller sizes due to fisheries impacts will implicate a\n\ndecrease in the local biodiversity (? and ? diversity) with possible implications for the shallow\n\nrocky subtidal (meta)community. The lower population size, smaller colonies and damaged\n\ncolonies may also decrease the ecological services attributed to gorgonians (e.g. scuba diving, fish\n\n213\n\n\n\nGORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION\n\nprotection). Most sessile marine organisms depend on water circulation to promote the encounter\n\nof gametes. In many corals, one of the species traits to increase reproduction success is sperm\n\nconcentration and high synchronization of spawning, leading to huge mass spawns, sometimes\n\nof multiple species (e.g. Babcock et al., 1986; Harrison, 2011). If population size drops below a\n\ncertain threshold, the concentration of gametes may be insufficient to guarantee the normal rates\n\nof fecundation of oocytes leading to reproductive failure, thus reducing population growth rates,\n\nsometimes to negative values, increasing the risk of extinction, a classic example of an Allee effect\n\n(Courchamp et al., 1999; Stephens and Sutherland, 1999). There is growing evidence that these\n\nnegative density dependent effects are important for species conservation efforts and fisheries\n\nmanagement (Stephens and Sutherland, 1999; Gascoigne and Lipcius, 2004; Courchamp et al.,\n\n2008).\n\nFor most marine species, but especially for sessile benthic species, the pelagic larval phase\n\nrepresents the primary opportunity for dispersal (Cowen et al., 2006; Cowen and Sponaugle,\n\n2009) as long as they produce more larvae than the necessary to assure self-recruitment (source\n\npopulation). Marine populations suffering continuous impacts rely on larval import from nearby\n\nareas to face extinction and to balance the local negative population growth (Cowen et al., 2006;\n\nKrebs, 2008; Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). Therefore, the persistence of metapopulations relies\n\ngreatly in the larval dispersal capacity between populations (connectivity). The connectivity\n\nbetween marine populations is very complex, depending on local oceanographic conditions\n\n(spatially complex), stochasticity (yearly fluctuations, natural disturbance) and biological traits\n\n(vertical movements, interactions), which differ greatly between species (Cowen et al., 2007; Jones\n\net al., 2007; Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009). Furthermore, in the last decade several studies pointed\n\nthat dispersal can be much lower than previously expected (see Cowen et al., 2000, 2007; Cowen\n\nand Sponaugle, 2009; Jones et al., 2009), and therefore connectivity has the potential to strongly\n\ninfluence local populations (or metapopulations) with consequences for the structure, dynamics\n\nand biodiversity of communities (or metacommunities).\n\nImplications, applications and recommendations\n\nUnder the current scenario of multiple uses, impacts and climate change on spatially complex\n\nand dynamic systems, such as coastal areas, density dependent effects, connectivity between\n\nmetapopulations and biotic interactions all play important roles in the sustainable use of those\n\necosystems. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), or marine reserves if they encompass a \u201cno take\u201d\n\nzone, have been largely used as management tools with two main objectives, fisheries manage-\n\nment and biodiversity protection (e.g. Pauly et al., 2002; Lubchenco et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2007;\n\nLester and Halpern, 2008; P\u00e9rez-Ruzafa et al., 2008). The conservation of marine ecosystems\n\nin Portugal is mainly regulated by European directives that were transposed to national laws,\n\n214\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nand to international conventions that were signed and ratified by Portugal (Birds and Habitats\n\ndirectives, Natura 2000). The European Union, encourages its members to reach the goal of\n\ncreating at least 10 % of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) by 2020 (Aichi Biodiversity Target 11,\n\nhttp://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/). OSPAR, also points to the development of a network of Marine\n\nProtected Areas as to protect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the North-East Atlantic.\n\nHowever, to the author best knowledge, there is currently any plan to achieve such percentage of\n\nMPAs in Portugal mainland in the near future.\n\nRecently, Lester and Halpern (2008) proved that reserve effects are higher in no-take reserves\n\nthan in partially protected areas, namely regarding biomass, density, species richness and or-\n\nganism size. These management tools have been successful in preventing coral loss besides\n\nother advantages and benefits (e.g. Selig and Bruno, 2010; Graham et al., 2011). Location and\n\nsize of MPAs greatly determine their outcomes, because coherent sets of marine reserves should\n\nencompass a representative area and collectively represent all the components of the regional\n\nbiodiversity. Also, MPAs should have a spillover effect replenishing populations of the adjacent non\n\nprotected areas, but in order to fulfil this requirement, metapopulation dynamics must be ensured\n\nthrough connectivity. This is the reason why currently networks of marine reserves are advocated.\n\nIn fact, an efficient network of MPAs must include as many as possible distinctive habitats and\n\nseveral replicates of representative habitats, have individually or collectively the necessary size to\n\nsupport minimum viable populations of large species, but also to be oceanographically connected\n\nin a way that ensures an efficient recruitment amongst individual MPAs. These characteristics\n\nshould foster the necessary resilience to a number of threats. The location of source populations\n\n(to be protected) is decisive for the connectivity at the local and regional level and will determine\n\nif a network of marine reserves is effective or not (Jones et al., 2007; Cowen and Sponaugle, 2009;\n\nWhite et al., 2010).\n\nOverall, the results presented in this thesis highlight the ecological importance of gorgonians\n\nin the southern Algarve coastal waters, namely by the enhancement of biodiversity. Impacts\n\non gorgonian assemblages and their distribution, abundance and structure patterns should be\n\ntaken into account while planning local MPAs networks. The reproductive cycle of Eunicella\n\ngazella provides information that can trigger new studies with more ambitious objectives, such\n\nas the connectivity of benthic broadcast spawners and the species traits that can influence the\n\nprocesses involved. The information on scuba diving impacts can be used to manage this activity\n\nin the region and should also be taken into account in the design of MPAs, as scuba diving\n\nwill probably be one of the uses on those areas. The impacts pointed out by this study can\n\nincrease the awareness of scuba divers to adopt measures that may significantly decrease their\n\nimpacts in the habitat. For example, gorgonians and other benthic species are proposed to\n\nbe used as indicators of scuba diving effects, which can be transposed to management plans.\n\nFinally, the indication that gorgonians are frequently and extensively damaged and the difficulties\n\n215\n\nhttp://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/\n\n\nGORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION\n\nencountered in preliminary transplantation experiments, strongly emphasize the need for more\n\nshort term studies focusing on the effects associated to colony damage and that conservation of\n\ngorgonian gardens is of high priority. These preliminary data need to be confirmed by further\n\nsampling and replicated in areas with different intensity of fishing pressure. Studies should also\n\nbe conducted to analyse energy use in damaged and healthy colonies of all gorgonian species.\n\nAccording to the distribution and abundance data (part I) and the extension of damaged colony\n\narea, Eunicella labiata and Eunicella gazella should be focused primarily. This is one clear example\n\nof the usefulness of the information contained in this thesis in terms of future research but also for\n\nmanagement purposes, suggesting also that more research is required to increase the probability\n\nof success of management plans.\n\nFuture research\n\nThe ecological importance of coral gardens is being acknowledged, as a consequence of studies\n\nconcerning the ecology and biology of these habitats. Because this is the first contribution on the\n\necology and biology of gorgonians for Southern Portugal and the second for the country, many\n\naspects were not addressed at all and much work still needs to be done. However, it is expected\n\nthat the information of this thesis, contributing for the knowledge of gorgonian populations, shall\n\nbe used for management and future research.\n\nAlthough in the Algarve coastal waters, fisheries have been thoroughly studied regarding\n\nlandings, fishing yield, by-catch and selectivity, mapping of the fishing intensity is not available.\n\nTherefore, it was extremely difficult to predict the fishing pressure of each area. The observation\n\nof lost fishing gears in a certain area, their quantity, diversity and degree of degradation; the\n\nnumber of fishing boats (professional and amateur) in a certain area along time; fishing gear tracks,\n\nprovide indirect evidence of fishing intensity. However, these methods are extremely laborious,\n\ntime consuming and expensive. The monitoring of fishing vessels in real time using advanced\n\npositioning systems (vessel tracking systems with GPS) would prove important to provide accurate\n\nand updated information to be used for quantifying fishing pressure dynamics. A database of lost\n\nfishing gears (date, coordinates, quantity, type) based on fishermen reports, and complemented by\n\nother sources such as scuba diving centres and governmental agencies, would also allow to further\n\nassess the threats to local populations. This data incorporated into GIS with multiple data sources\n\n(landings, vessel data, habitat mapping) would be able to provide maps of use and intensity that\n\ncan be used for the management of the coast. This type of information is extremely important for\n\nMPAs planning and design, but also for ecological studies dealing with impact assessment, namely\n\nstudies on damage assessment of gorgonians by fishing gears. It would also serve to discriminate\n\nthe effects of natural disturbance from those of fishing activities both in abundance and size-\n\nfrequency data.\n\n216\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nOn the other hand, climate change is probably one of the most challenging and important\n\nissues concerning marine ecosystems (e.g. Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010). The effects of global\n\nwarming go beyond physiological adaptation of species and consequent shifts in the structure\n\nof marine communities. Most certainly they will also result on changes in ocean and coastal\n\ncirculation patterns possibly affecting the connectivity between habitats due to reduced dispersal\n\nof propagules. What is more, the chemical properties of sea water are changing, leading to\n\nocean acidification which is a major threat to several species and even to entire ecosystems, such\n\nas coral reefs. Similarly to hard corals, many gorgonian species present calcium carbonate on\n\nthe form of calcite with an important function on their form and structure. The calcification\n\nprocesses are changed by ocean acidification which may lead to changes in the physical properties\n\nof gorgonians affecting, if not their survival, at least their ecological role, ultimately reducing\n\nthe biodiversity and resilience of habitats. In the last two decades, many benthic organisms,\n\nincluding gorgonians have suffered mass mortalities attributed to increased sea temperature and\n\nconsequent disease outbreaks (e.g. Cerrano et al., 2000; Martin et al., 2002; Linares et al., 2005;\n\nBally and Garrabou, 2007). Therefore, continuous monitoring of sea water temperatures with high\n\nspatial resolution (low cost temperature data loggers) would provide information on the spatial\n\nand temporal variability (and possible causes) which could be used to make predictable models to\n\nassess vulnerability of habitats, areas or species. Coastal water circulation models would be greatly\n\nimproved with such data, especially if complemented by other methodologies (Conductivity,\n\nTemperature, and Depth, CTD sensors; Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers in areas of exceptional\n\ncomplexity) and additional data (e.g. coast and seafloor morphology). Robust coastal circulation\n\nmodels are extremely important for the implementation of MPA networks because connectivity is\n\nstrongly influenced by water circulation.\n\nAt last, transplantation methods using small colony fragments are one of the measures that can\n\nbe used in the future to restore the gorgonian populations affected by impacts (Rinkevich, 2000;\n\nShafir et al., 2006; Shaish et al., 2008). During a first attempt to address this issue, preliminary\n\nresults from transplantation experiments were not optimistic. Indeed, high mortality rates were\n\nobserved probably due to a mix of important factors such as: high temperatures during the\n\ntransplantation process as the experiment was conducted during the summer (August), and high\n\nsedimentation in the transplantation site. In fact, one month after transplantation, more than half\n\nof the transplanted fragments (42 transplants of 2 cm fragments of Eunicella gazella; 84 transplants\n\nof Leptogorgia lusitanica of two size classes, 2 and 5 cm, 42 each) were alive and apparently in good\n\nhealth (Figure C.2) even though some presented low levels of fouling by algae in the branch tips.\n\nHowever, three months after transplantation more than 85 % of the transplants died (Figure C.2).\n\nSome of the bases where the transplants were fixed were broken and the cables that hold them to\n\nthe artificial reefs were cut, probably as a consequence of bad weather that displaced a set of ghost\n\nfishing traps that were found nearby. The remaining bases were completely covered with sediment\n\nand most of the transplants that were still alive presented partial damage and extensive fouling.\n\n217\n\n\n\nGORGONIANS OF THE SOUTH OF PORTUGAL: BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION\n\nFigure C.2.: Transplanted fragments of Leptogorgia lusitanica and Eunicella gazella. top-left: transplant-\nation of small fragments to cement bases; top-right: bases with transplants fixed to artificial\nreefs; centre-left and bottom-left: transplants one month after transplantation; bottom-right:\ndead transplant of Leptogorgia lusitanica on base completely covered with sediment. Photos by\nJo\u00e3o C\u00fardia and Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Sofia\n\n218\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThese experiments could benefit from a better knowledge on the suitable conditions for\n\nachieving acceptable survival rates (e.g. temperature threshold). This kind of information can be\n\nobtained through controlled experiments in aquaria in relation to the physiology and biology of\n\ngorgonians. Some examples are the effects of increased temperature on growth, stress, reproduct-\n\nive output, metabolism and feeding of gorgonians. They are also important to gain knowledge on\n\nsome aspects of the reproductive biology of gorgonians, such as spawning, fertilization and larval\n\ndevelopment, otherwise only possible through difficult, laborious and expensive in situ studies. All\n\nthis information is missing for the most common and abundant gorgonian species of the Algarve.\n\nHowever, it is of utmost importance to understand the full life cycle of these benthic organisms.\n\nThe results of such experiments can be used to build predictable models for future scenarios, as\n\nis being done for other octocoral species such as Paramuricea clavata (Linares et al., 2007, 2008d)\n\nand Corallium rubrum (Torrents et al., 2008). Furthermore, the use of gorgonians in restoration\n\nefforts and harvesting for the industry of natural products (if they cannot be synthesized), involves\n\nthe sexual or asexual (vegetative) reproduction of gorgonians and their rearing to a suitable size\n\nfor transplantation or harvest, which greatly depends on the information regarding the life cycle of\n\nthe species.\n\nBibliography\n\nBabcock, R.
