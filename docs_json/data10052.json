pollution, dry seasons and famine countries. Only the fuel price peak made \n\nway for us to become aware of resource scarcity, and in general, about global natural \n\nresources depletion, along with greenhouse effect gases and the exhaustion of earth \n\ncarrying capacity. \n\nFurthermore, become clear the mankind responsibility for this situation, and mainly the \n\neconomic production models set in motion after World War II, based on cheap natural \n\nenergy sources, but non-renewable. \n\nAt the core of those economic production models are the corporations, and the marketing \n\nfunction they perform. So, marketing management plays a determinant role for the \n\nenvironmental chaos where we are immersed. The new paradigm of sustainable \n\nmarketing, developed by Professor Donald A. Fuller can reverse this trend, and contribute \n\nfor different production models in respect for the environment. \n\nThe present case study aim to perform a sustainable marketing audit to a product-specific \n\nin order to: \n\n1. Perform a sustainable audit to the product-specific; \n\n2. Assess the product-specific sustainability; \n\n3. Identify differentiation and innovation measures that can become marketing \n\nadvantages; \n\n4. Assess the product\u2019s commitment to ecological and social responsibility. \n\nThe new sustainable marketing framework was applied to the capsulated coffee brand \n\nDelta Q, from the Portuguese coffee industry leading company, DELTA Caf\u00e9s. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\nThe research produced a clear Delta Q environmental strategic positioning regarding P2 \n\n(Pollution Prevention) and R2 (Resource Recovery) basic sustainable marketing goals. \n\nIt resulted also in a SWOT analysis covering both company and the product-specific, \n\nregarding every dimension of the production and marketing processes dealing with waste \n\ngeneration, which allow devising a future sound sustainable strategy. \n\nOther research findings were the opportunities to develop marketing advantages through \n\nDelta Q production and distribution processes differentiation and/or innovation. \n\nMoreover, the research came to prove the framework operability and allowed the \n\nidentification of important issues for further investigation, like cost-structure impact of the \n\nsustainable marketing approach, or the internalization of eco-cost into the product\u2019s price. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n1.2 Portuguese Abstract (Sum\u00e1rio) \n\nA crise financeira, as altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, os terramotos e o aquecimento global, quase \n\nfizeram esquecer a polui\u00e7\u00e3o, a seca e fome em muitos pa\u00edses. Apenas o pico do pre\u00e7o do \n\npetr\u00f3leo, abriu caminho para nos tornarmos conscientes da escassez de recursos e, em \n\ngeral, do esgotamento dos recursos naturais globais, juntamente com os gases com efeito \n\nde estufa e do esgotamento da capacidade terra. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, tornou-se clara a responsabilidade da humanidade para esta situa\u00e7\u00e3o e, \n\nprincipalmente, os modelos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o econ\u00f3mica implementados ap\u00f3s a Segunda \n\nGuerra Mundial, com base em fontes de energia naturais baratas, mas n\u00e3o renov\u00e1veis. \n\nNo n\u00facleo dos modelos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o econ\u00f3mica est\u00e3o as empresas, bem como as fun\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde marketing que desempenham. Assim, a gest\u00e3o de marketing desempenha um papel \n\ndeterminante para o caos ambiental em que nos encontramos imersos. O novo paradigma \n\ndo marketing sustent\u00e1vel, desenvolvido pelo Professor Donald A. Fuller, pode inverter \n\nesta tend\u00eancia e contribuir para desenvolver modelos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o diferentes em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nao meio ambiente. \n\nO objectivo do presente estudo de caso \u00e9 realizar uma auditoria de marketing sustent\u00e1vel \n\npara: \n\n1. Auditar a sustentabilidade do produto-espec\u00edfico; \n\n2. Avaliar a sustentabilidade do produto-espec\u00edfico; \n\n3. Identificar medidas de diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o e inova\u00e7\u00e3o que possam constituir vantagens \n\nde marketing; \n\n4. Avaliar o compromisso do produto-espec\u00edfico com a responsabilidade ecol\u00f3gica e \n\nsocial. \n\nA nova abordagem do marketing sustent\u00e1vel foi aplicada \u00e0 marca de caf\u00e9 capsulado Delta \n\nQ, da empresa portuguesa l\u00edder da ind\u00fastria de caf\u00e9, DELTA Caf\u00e9s. \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\nDa pesquisa resultou um posicionamento, ambiental e estrat\u00e9gico, claro do Delta Q em \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o aos objectivos b\u00e1sicos do marketing sustent\u00e1vel: P2 (Preven\u00e7\u00e3o da Polui\u00e7\u00e3o) e R2 \n\n(Recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de Recursos), como objectivos b\u00e1sicos do marketing sustent\u00e1vel. \n\nResultou tamb\u00e9m uma an\u00e1lise SWOT que abrange tanto a empresa como o produto-\n\nespec\u00edfico, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a cada dimens\u00e3o dos processos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o que \n\ns\u00e3o respons\u00e1veis pela gera\u00e7\u00e3o de res\u00edduos e, que permitem definir uma estrat\u00e9gia \n\nsustent\u00e1vel para o futuro. \n\nOutro resultado da pesquisa foi a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o das oportunidades para desenvolver \n\nvantagens de marketing atrav\u00e9s de diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o e inova\u00e7\u00e3o do produto e respectivos \n\nprocessos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nAdicionalmente, a pesquisa permitiu concluir sobre a operacionalidade da nova \n\nabordagem do marketing sustent\u00e1vel e identificar quest\u00f5es importantes para futuras \n\ninvestiga\u00e7\u00f5es, tais como o impacto do marketing sustent\u00e1vel na estrutura de custos, ou a \n\ninternaliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos custos ecol\u00f3gicos no processo de forma\u00e7\u00e3o do pre\u00e7o do produto. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n2 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThis work is dedicated to Beatriz, Miguel and Dinis, who deserve to enjoy the planet as \n\nmuch as we have done, and to whom we have the responsibility to assure their education \n\nand ability for further protecting the earth ecological systems. \n\nFor the accomplishment of this research project, several beloved people have contributed, \n\nwhether with work, ideas, knowledge or hard motivation. To them all I send my deepest \n\nthanks. For some of them, taking the risk of forgetting someone unintentionally, I would \n\nlike to express my special gratitude: \n\nThe Professors Margarida Duarte, Jo\u00e3o Mota e Lu\u00edz Moutinho, for the scientific thinking, \n\nthey taught me; \n\nThe Professor Carmo Leal for her patience and attention to detail; \n\nTo Nadir for her role in my life and by encouraging the birth of this project; \n\nTo Paula, Wilma and Teresinha for keeping me in my toes to get the job done; \n\nTo my mother for the proper and delicious feeding during the long nights working; \n\nTo N\u00e9lia who endured many weekend absences, for listening actively my outbursts and \n\nfor being the person as dear she is. \n\nI also wish to thank to Delta Caf\u00e9s team who supported this project with enthusiasm and \n\ncommitment: Rui Miguel Nabeiro (CEO), Marco Miranda (Head of R&amp;D) and Isabel \n\nRamalhete (Delta Q PM).  \n\nI do believe that my generation holds a special responsibility before the ones to come and \n\nfor the planet\u2019s future. Never before, was so clear and grounded the harm done by \n\nmankind to ecosystems due to intensive earth resource exploration and mass industrial \n\nproduction. However, ever like the present, was possible to face the challenge of \n\nreversing the trend and act responsibly on the natural environment. \n\nIt is my firm wish to have contributed to such endeavour, within the marketing field, \n\nwhich has been my professional life for the last twenty years. \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n3 INTRODUCTION \n\nContemporary media review patent a changing world, immersed in deep financial and \n\nenergetic (or fuel) crisis, natural cataclysms like earthquakes, tsunamis, and climate \n\nchange, along with dramatic advances in medicine, science and communication \n\ntechnologies, in particular. Nevertheless, there are another media news that suggest old \n\nstories. Like the ones of regional conflicts that keep arising trough all the emerging and \n\nless developed economies (or countries, for this purpose). Middle and near East, or Sub-\n\nSaharan African countries, continue to face a severe food crisis as for the last thirty years. \n\nDespite phenomenal economic advancements in Asia's region, some countries do still \n\nface high rates in child mortality. The same general description could be as well applied \n\nfor middle and far-east, or Central and South America (Latin America). UN estimates that \n\nmore than one thousand million persons were suffering from hunger in 2009, and over \n\nthan two thousand million persons are living with less than one USD per day. \n\nThe need for a new economic growth era, well foreseen by the Brundtland commission \n\nreport for UN back in 1987, is today more needed than ever. However, this growth is to \n\nbe achieved with innovative economic and production models, once the planet\u2019s resources \n\n(which have sourced prior economic growth during twentieth century) are in danger of \n\ntotal depletion. Especially the absence of new reserves of cheap energy sources, like crude \n\noil and coal requires sustainable development and growth models. \n\nMoreover, climate change due to human production activities mainly related to fossil \n\nfuels burn and other toxic gas emissions by mass industrial activities, determine radical \n\nnew approaches to the problems of economic production and distribution, energy sources. \n\nThis new paradigm provided the foundations for marketing, once part of the problem (by \n\nthe main focus on the demand increase for consumption), to become an active part of the \n\nsolution. This paradigm embodies the Sustainable Marketing approach and provides \n\neffective tools for marketers to enforce social and ecological responsibilities. \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\nSustainable marketing audit is the first step for designing a complete strategic sustainable \n\nmarketing plan. It corresponds to the diagnostic task and provides a comprehensive \n\ninterpretation of a company\u2019s stand, commitment and involvement with ecological \n\nconcerns. \n\nThe emergence of greater widespread demand for better living conditions regarding \n\nfundamental human rights like caloric and vitamin quality feeding; general health care \n\nand education, along with human development dimensions in order to promote and \n\nmaintain peace, brought the necessary conditions for new social goals. Those goals \n\ninclude governance, business and other organizations, both at national and international \n\nlevels. \n\nA new self conscience has risen into collective responsibility, spreading from self action \n\naccountability to social and organization responsibility on actions and on resources use \n\n(human, technical or/and natural). On another side vast regions of the globe remain \n\nincapable to get rid of tribal conflicts, local or ethnical wars, and to climb the \n\ndevelopment ladder towards human rights respect, democratic elected governments, \n\neducation and general better welfare for the people. It thus became wide exposed to \n\nnatural catastrophes like earthquakes, prolonged dry seasons and extreme food shortage, \n\ngiving place to an endless down-cycle of lesser economic growth, greater poverty, more \n\nhunger, armed conflicts\u2026 and so on. \n\nWrapping the human/social issues above, the ecological earth systems become more \n\nstressed and depleted. Atmospheric pollution reducing solar UV radiation1 protection, \n\nOzone layer diminishing, fisheries impoverished, global warming by greenhouse gases \n\nreleases and weather climate change, became too familiar and close jargon, that most of \n\n                                                 \n1\n Radiation at the longer UV wavelengths of 320-400 nm (nanometers, or billionths of a meter), called \nUV-A, plays a helpful and essential role in formation of Vitamin D by the skin, and plays a harmful \nrole in that it causes sunburn on human skin and cataracts in our eyes. \nhttp://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/UVB/, 14/3/2011. \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\nthe times none (persons, organizations or governments) really notice and take care, for \n\nboth meaning and tremendous dangerous consequences of not acting. \n\nInternational organizations like the UN and the European Commission (also considering \n\ntheir respective branches as the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, the European Investment \n\nBank, among others) have called companies, and other non profit and non governmental \n\norganizations and institutions, to help solving the most critical problems humanity is \n\nfacing nowadays. This involvement of supra-national organizations, enterprises and \n\ngovernments has given rise to a multiplicity of concepts and methods of approach to a full \n\nand detailed diagnosis of what to do, how to make and how to fund what needs to be \n\ndone. It was built so the notion of corporate social responsibility (CSR). \n\nOne can remounts the birthplace of this international movement transverse to \n\norganizations, companies and governments in the well-known 1987 Brundtland Report \n\nfor the UN commission on the environment and development. This report has identified \n\nfor the first time at a global level, the following issues that confront and resolve, urged to \n\nensure the survival of humanity and improving their quality of life: \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 - UN\u2019S diagnostics for the need of new growth and development cycle \n\n1. The absolute difference between the North (developed) and the South \n(still in development); \n\n2. The incapacity of the latter to provide minimum levels of welfare to \nlaunch their own development processes, especially in the areas of food, \nhealth, education, economic growth and viable investments; \n\n3. The need to protect the environment and stop the depletion of natural \nresources of the planet in order to ensure the future generations welfare; \n\n4. The need to launch a new era of growth/economic development with a \nnew production model that respects the environment, based on \ntechnology that would ensure the welfare of humanity without \nexhausting natural resources or impair life ability, (which is) reducing \nand preventing pollution. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\nThis is the concept of sustainability at a global scale and constitutes the foundation for \n\norganizations and business companies\u2019 new paradigm. As well as for development of \n\neconomic activities/production on a global scale and in a comprehensive manner ranging \n\nfrom the private issues to public or governmental, characterized by:  \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 - New marketing management decision boundaries \n\n\u2022 Responsibility for the living conditions of future generations; \n\n\u2022 Respect for the environment; \n\n\u2022 Steady (and sustainable) economic growth. \n\n \n\nConfirming the relevance of the diagnosis it came to check on global warming and \n\necological disasters resulting in carrying capacity2 exhaustion (and almost extinction of \n\nsome species) of the once considered inexhaustible ocean; continued power crisis; \n\ninability of an expanded group of countries to launch and sustain their own development \n\nprocesses and economic/social growth, and even democratic government systems. \n\nWeather climate change caused long dries followed by formidable storms and floods. The \n\nmap of world hunger in the report of the World Food Program from UN for 2009 outlines \n\nthe following scenario of world population suffering from hunger: \n\n \nTable 3.3 - UN 2009 world hunger map \n\nAsia and Pacific 642 million \n\nsub-Saharan Africa 265 million \n\nLatin America and the Caribbean 53 million \n\nNorth Africa and Near East 42 million \n\nTotal 1.002 million \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2 Carrying capacity refers to the number of individuals who can be supported in a given area within \n\nnatural resource limits, and without degrading the natural social, cultural and economic environment \nfor present and future generations. Global development research centre: \nhttp://www.gdrc.org/uem/footprints/carrying-capacity.html, 14-03-2011. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\nThese figures account for almost 15% of world population! Global communications and \n\ninternational financial flows allowed to spread to the world the banking system's crisis, \n\notherwise it would only be a USA national problem, with limited impact on some more \n\nexposed economies. In reality, the less developed economies are also suffering with the \n\nalien greed. \n\nOn another hand, the success achieved with the global fight against aerosols with CFC\u00b4s3, \n\nwhich were to degrade the ozone layer4, confirmed that humanity already has (at least in \n\nsome cases) the diagnostics capabilities and effective tools for intervention/resolution of \n\nenvironmental problems at a worldwide scale. \n\nRecent diagnostics, well grounded on valid scientific research, demonstrated economic \n\nand business downgrade due to natural resources exhaustion. Despite the widespread \n\nappeal from civil society, academia and a few politicians, the production models of the \n\npast century (based on the intensive exploitation of natural resources and non-renewable \n\nenergy sources), still remain active and facing strong barriers to be abandoned. \n\nResistances to change is forceful and only recently have been conceptualized models to \n\naccelerate necessary change in a world that is also changing the dynamics of economic \n\nand business growth, social and ethical behaviour, and new life standards that people and \n\norganizations aim to satisfy.   \n\n                                                 \n3  CFC's \u2013 Chlorofluorocarbons are a family of non-reactive, non-flammable gases and volatile liquids. \n\nBecause of their properties they are used in a multitude of applications\u2026 The non-reactivity of CFC's, so \ndesirable to industry, allows them to drift for years in the environment until they eventually reach the \nstratosphere. High in the stratosphere intense UV solar radiation severs chlorines off of the CFC's, and it is \nthese unattached chlorines that are able to catalytically convert Ozone molecules into Oxygen molecules. \nhttp://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/history.html, 10-03-2011 \n\n \n4  According to latest data from SCAR \u2013 Scientific Committee on Antarctica Research and NASA \n\nOzone Hole Watch, ozone hole over Antarctica has been effectively dropping after the original \nMontreal Protocol was signed in the fall of 1987, based on negotiations started between European, \nScandinavian countries and the USA over CFC's in aerosol sprays in 1983. The protocol has gone \nthrough a series of revisions [\u2026] as new information from science and industry has become available. \nThe latest one, held in Copenhagen in November of 1992, laid down the most stringent CFC phase-\nout schedule for CFC's for the world to date; and was signed by over 100 nations representing 95% of \nthe world's current CFC consumption. http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/history.html, \n14-03-2011 \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\nThe growing needs and increasing desires of consumers, given the new paradigm of \n\nsustainable development and the emergence of CSR, clearly defines the fresh context and \n\nboundaries for management and marketing management decisions for companies and \n\nprofessionals with responsible attitudes in face of the renewed challenges. \n\nAccording to several authors (Fuller, 1999; Van Dam and Apeldoorn, 1996 and Porter, \n\n1991) sustainable marketing (considering marketing as the main management approach to \n\ndaily business decision trough competitive and successful companies) is the most \n\nappropriate framework to ensure:  \n\n \nTable 3.4 New responsible principles for marketing decisions \n\n\u2022 Compliance with the new restrictions (and opportunities) on environment \nand ecology. \n\n\u2022 Meeting consumer-markets and business growing demand. \n\n\u2022 Effective Social Responsibility actions. \n\n \n \nThe decisive importance of these issues has received considerable attention of the \n\nacademy, translated into a vast output of research and thesis. The most prevalent \n\nmarketing approaches to CSR and environmental issues have been on the differentiation \n\nand communication of companies and brands associated with social causes. These \n\npromotion efforts aim to obtain some marketing differentiation or to leverage advantages, \n\ntrough advertising on green or environment friendly features. This is the paradoxical5 case \n\nof BP re-branding from British Petroleum to Beyond Petroleum, or the case of Portuguese \n\nelectricity producer EDP massive advertising and international recognition on green \n\ncompany and major renewable energy producer, but who, nevertheless, still operates coal \n\nand fuel power plants. \n\n                                                 \n5\n Paradox \u2013 \u2026group of premises apparently indisputable leading to inacceptable or contradictory \nconclusions. (Blackburn, Simon, The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, , Oxford university Press, \n1994). \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\nAccording to Ottman (2006) aside from offering environmental benefits that do not meet \n\nconsumer preferences, green marketing myopia can also occur when the products fail to \n\nprovide credible, substantive benefits for environment. Which become ecological and \n\nmanagerial useless for as much as those strategies fail to prevent pollution, waste stream \n\ngeneration, nor promoting resource recovery (Fuller and Gillett, 1999), and fail to achieve \n\ncompany\u2019s marketing targets. \n\nThe present research assumes the stand point about sustainability construct as \n\nenvironmental based, and wish to investigate the impact of the new ecological decision \n\nboundaries in the marketing management processes to produce better (or improved) \n\nenvironmental-friendly products, benefits and to reduce waste generation, without losing \n\nof sight the traditional marketing management objectives. \n\n \n\n4 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES \n\nAt the heart of productive activity and trade of goods and services is the MARKETING, \n\nwhich has gained preponderance increasingly dilated in the daily management of business \n\n(Kotler and Keller, 2005). Therefore, the marketing is in the pivotal position to enter and \n\nlead this paradigm shift of production operations and of marketing decisions across \n\nbusinesses. (Fuller, 1999). By evolving towards sustainable marketing, companies can \n\npursue their traditional goals within a new ethical6 framework defined by the new social \n\nresponsibility and environmentally sustainable principles. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6\n Ethics - (from the Greek ethos, character) Study of the concepts involved in practical reasoning: good, \nright action, obligation, virtue, freedom, choice. Ethics of Management - The branch of ethics that \nanalyzes the problems and dilemmas created by the practices of management, for example, the social \nresponsibilities of enterprises, the appropriate limits acceptable to the competition(Blackburn, Simon, \nThe Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Oxford university Press, 1994). \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n4.1 Sustainable marketing case study objectives \n\nThe present work, under a case study approach method, holds four central objectives to \n\nachieve. The first is to perform a product-specific sustainable marketing audit. The second \n\nis to perform a sustainable marketing diagnostic. The third deals with the possible \n\nidentification of improvements/innovations which can become a product\u2019s (or company's) \n\nof marketing differentiation or advantages. And the fourth is the assessment of the \n\ncompany\u2019s commitment to ecological responsibility. These objectives are fully detailed in \n\nthe following chapters. \n\n \n\n4.1.1 Product-specific sustainable marketing audit \n\nPresent research substantiates the implementation of the new approach proposed in 1999 \n\nby professor Donald A. Fuller from University of Central Florida \u2013 College of Business \n\nAdministration, in his book \u201cSustainable Marketing: Managerial - Ecological Issues\u201d, \n\n1999, in a sustainable marketing audit to a product-specific. In this case, to the Portuguese \n\ncapsulated coffee brand Delta Q, to assess the brand\u2019s compliance with sustainable \n\nmarketing decision\u2019s boundaries: \n\n1) Compatibility with the ecosystem; \n\n2) Product-System Life-Cycle (PSLC) of the product; \n\n3) Respect for the balance of ecosystems7, in all marketing management decisions. \n\nThe fundamental research question the study aspires to investigate is to discover and \n\ndescribe how Delta Q operationalize sustainability, in order to achieve business goals in \n\nbalance with the new boundaries for marketing management regarding the environment. \n\n                                                 \n7\n \u201cEcosystem is a complex system composed of two elements in constant interaction: (1) an \nenvironment of a physical-chemical (moisture + light + salinity + temperature + pressure + soil + ...), \nabiotic (without human influence), and well delimited in space and time, which is called Biotope, and \n(2) the set of living beings, or Biocenosis that inhabits this biotope. It is the basic functional element \nof the biosphere. It is maintained by a flow of energy and matter between these different components \nin permanent interaction.\u201d Isabel Mendes, 2010, Seminar \"Valuing Nature\", ISEG, January 13, 2010 \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n\nAnother important issue to research is to find out if operationalization and investment on \n\nsystemic controls to manage and monitor the marketing management paradigm towards \n\nsocial responsibility and sustainability can somehow, re-engineer the business model and \n\nprocesses to achieve better efficiency and profitability. \n\nA third issue the present research also aims is to help defining a new set of tools to assess \n\nglobal products, services and business performance and results, not only trough the fine \n\nmonitoring of ecologic and social boundaries to be respected but, and most important to \n\nproduce and deliver increased value (throughout the value-chain) to customers, \n\nstakeholders, shareholders, and environment. \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Sustainable marketing diagnostic \n\nThe sustainable marketing audit will allow setting the current position of the product-\n\nspecific environmental strategy in the matrix of environmental reinvented or improved \n\nproduct\u2019s strategic guidance, with regard to the basic strategies of the new paradigm: \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 - Management basic goals \n\nP2 \nPollution Prevention \n\nR2 \nResource Recovery \n\n \n\nTo do so, will be used a marketing audit check-list expanded by sustainable marketing \n\nprinciples and assumptions: the ISO 14001 (International Standards Organization) norm, \n\nthe GEMA (Global Environment Management Audit) audit check lists, CSR Europe \n\nsustainable marketing management principles and EMAS (Environmental Management \n\nAudit Scheme) audit checklists. \n\nP2 goals (and subsequent strategies) deal with actions and projects to prevent pollution. It \n\nis a proactive set of measures to act before pollution and waste are generated. Of course it \n\nalso contains steps and programs aimed for reducing waste/pollution or to increase waste \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n\nrecyclability (and sometimes reuse) or pollution treatment or further sequestration. \n\nEffective P2 strategies reduce the need for future heavy R2 actions or investments. \n\nR2 goals (and subsequent strategies) consist of corrective measures on current products \n\nand processes in order to consume lesser resources or to incorporate already used \n\nresources (re-use) from the product\u2019s processes (or from other product production \n\nprocesses). Hence, in a certain way, R2 strategies also can help effectiveness of prior P2 \n\ngoals. Moreover, proper P2 strategies make easier to achieve R2 goals. Taking together \n\nP2 and R2 strategies reinforce each other goal achievement; therefore, they are \n\nfundamental to a successful sustainable marketing strategy. \n\n \nFigure 4.1 - P2 and R2 reinforcement cycle \n\n \n\n \nThe diagnostic resulting from the sustainable marketing audit will permit an in depth and \n\ncomprehensive knowledge and understanding of company\u2019s position and effective use \n\nand respect for social and ecologic boundaries, particularly as regards to: \n\n1) Respect for the environment, in terms of preventing pollution (P2) and resource \n\nrecovery (R2); \n\n2) Responsibility for the living conditions of future generations; \n\n3) The extent to which is possible to attain a constant and sustainable economic \n\ngrowth. \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n\nWith this characterization is possible to identify company\u2019s strengths to draw a successful \n\nsustainable strategy able to deliver increase value for customers, company and \n\nenvironmental protection. \n\n \n\n4.1.3 Identification of differentiating improvements/innovations \n\nThe audit should also allow identifying the strengths and weaknesses for the product (or \n\nsometimes for the company), which compared with the external macro environment \n\n(constraints and opportunities) may set the bearing for the future sustainable marketing \n\nstrategy of product-specific audited. \n\nAnother source of differentiation that sustainable marketing audit method can provide, \n\nrelates to product\u2019s (or product\u2019s subsidiary) utility or benefits enhancement. Distribution \n\nsystems and packing processes and requirements can also constitute important sources of \n\nmarketing differentiation strategies and even lowering cost structures. \n\n \n\n4.1.4 Assessment of company\u2019s commitment to ecological responsibility \n\nThe product-specific sustainable marketing audit process should allow to understand, \n\nthrough documentation content analysis, the company involvement with ecological \n\nresponsibility. Detailed content analysis of the interviews will provide some \"indicators\" ( \n\nessentially qualitative), which will assess the degree of CSR and sustainable marketing \n\nintegration on decision-making processes of marketing, management (including top-\n\nmanagement) and employees in general, on a day-to-day basis. \n\n \n\n4.2 Case study, the scientific contribution   \n\nThis research project on sustainable marketing has it main contribution to the level of \n\nStrategic Marketing Planning, once it is an empirical test for the strategic marketing \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n\nplanning, development and implementation for a product-specific under this enhanced \n\ndiagnosis and strategic planning framework. \n\nThe final report shows a clear characterization of the current position of the product-\n\nspecific audited in accordance with the new model of marketing management \n\ndevelopment and decision, with regard to P2 and R2 goals. \n\nAnother expected result is to identify the strengths of the marketing process and \n\nassociated opportunities, to serve as a starting point for the construction of the strategic \n\nmarketing planning for Delta Q. \n\nAs far as it could be ascertained, the application of this method of strategic sustainable \n\nmarketing diagnostic is unprecedented in Portugal, hence its importance emerges also \n\nfrom the ability to provide effective tools to make incremental changes on everyday \n\nmarketing management decisions, thus incrementing profitability and reducing the \n\necological footprint. \n\nLet's assume for a moment that a leading company from a bigger market than the \n\nPortuguese, by restructuring its distribution operations based on lorry logistics by better \n\non-line purchase orders and rationalized distribution routes, achieves a 10% diesel saving. \n\nThus after a complete financial year, company would evidence increased profits. \n\nAs a result it would reward shareholders with larger profit distribution, and stock prices \n\nwould also be higher, providing company with better funding options. \n\nAt the same time trough, an active partnership strategy with the software provider based \n\non international positive referral, other industry companies from abroad start to replicate \n\nthe project and achieve identical diesel savings on their operations. If the model could be \n\nreplicated for other industries and markets, soon there would be a global diesel demand \n\ndecrease. \n\nThe benefits are self evident: increased company\u2019s profitability, higher stock prices, larger \n\nand cheaper funding availability, less energy consumption, lesser carbon monoxide \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\nemissions and negative demand pressure on oil markets that would eventually redound in \n\noil prices dropping. \n\nThe power of incremental improvements lies in their total sum. The result of these \n\nimprovements in each industrial process, in each distribution system, in the way a product \n\nis consumed or disposed, towards environmental protection, or lesser waste generation, or \n\nfewer natural resources used, will end up in major impact on ecosystem balance, in \n\nhuman environmental life quality, and at the end in a better and sustainable planet.  \n\nSustainable marketing framework for strategic marketing planning and decision can ignite \n\na virtuous cycle of change to foster greener products, with more benefits for consumer \n\nand less ecological impact. This innovative approach can effectively be the cradle for a \n\nnew growth era, based on respect for environment and people who need it to the pursuit \n\nof life quality and well being. \n\n \n\n5 RESEARCH METHOD \n\nThe selected approach is the case study method. Although research based on case studies \n\nis acceptable for a relatively short time in the Portuguese universities, in other foreign \n\nuniversities it has been practiced for long and accepted as a methodology for valid \n\nscientific research, with valuable and robust findings. Such is the case of Harvard \n\nUniversity and countries like Sweden or Finland (Carson, Gilmore, Perry, and Gronhaug, \n\n2001). \n\nThe absence of previous publications or other case studies in a relevant field or discipline \n\nas new as sustainable marketing is, suggested the need for an exploratory study aimed at \n\ndefining the precise contours of the management problem and the implications for \n\nmarketing management processes development. \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\nDeveloping solid exploration work will enable the preliminary knowledge body to \n\nstrengthen further quantitative approaches, which might allow the development of models \n\nto support and enhance the process of decision making in the context of strategic planning \n\nfor sustainable marketing and environmental responsibility. \n\nThe opportunity for a descriptive study, according to Malhotra and Birks (2006), also \n\nemerges from the need of studying and interpreting the phenomena within the business \n\nenvironment, where sustainable marketing processes and decisions are made. \n\nThe essence of daily management interaction with whole stakeholders is particularly \n\nsuitable to case study research, once it allows investigating and documenting the \n\ninvolvement of people in the dynamic environment of the phenomena, not running the \n\nrisk of ignoring their capacity to reflect on the problems of the situation and interact on \n\nthem (Robson, 1993). \n\nCase study research does not necessarily follow a rigid positivist stand, based on the \n\nstrength of phenomena observation to extract patterns and theories, which are assured \n\nthrough quantitative internal and external validity (Campbell, and Stanley, 1963). \n\nHowever, it neither means that the preference for a more qualitative approach to the study \n\nof phenomena associated with the marketing strategies development is a pure relativistic \n\ninterpretation of individual cases, regarding social and ecological responsibility. \n\nConsidering that any type of business optimization or decision-making support is \n\nnecessarily contingent and the result of systemic processes, the approach through case \n\nstudies ensures a degree of neutrality between the two paradigms, providing a \n\ncomprehensive interpretation of the phenomenon in its real context (Myers, 2000). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n\n5.1 Case study protocol \n\nCase study method approach holds only one similarity with a survey-questionnaire: both \n\naim to a single data collection (Yin, 2009). Beyond that, everything is different and \n\ncomplies with distinct objectives and requirements. A case study protocol contains the \n\nobjectives, the rules and procedures to be respected in the process of comprehensive data \n\ngathering. \n\nMoreover, it is to be used by the researcher as a kind of a \u201cscript\u201d and not to be presented \n\nto the subject interviewed has a means of answer registry. Thus the case study protocol is \n\na major way to increase the research robustness and reliability (Yin, 2009). \n\nFollowing is the protocol developed for the present research on Delta Q sustainability \n\nassessment and positioning against P2 (pollution prevention) and R2 (resource recovery) \n\nbasic goals for sustainable marketing: \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Case study protocol \n\nManagement \n\nProblem \n\nTo approach the positioning of Delta Q coffee capsule in the strategic \n\nproduct environment matrix in relation to Basic sustainable marketing \n\ngoals P2 and R2. \n\nResearch \nProblem \n\nTo develop a sustainable marketing audit of the capsulated coffee \n\nfrom DELTA Caf\u00e9s, branded Delta Q. \n\nCase Study \nobjectives \n\na) The sustainable marketing audit is an exploratory and descriptive \n\nstudy of the phenomena and issues arising from a product-specific \n\npositioning in the strategic-environmental matrix, and subsequent \n\navailable strategies to develop. \n\nb) Sustainable marketing diagnostic. \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n\nc) Identification of differentiating improvements/innovations. \n\nd) Assessment of company\u2019s commitment to ecological \n\nresponsibility. \n\nAnalysis \nunit \n\nThe study is to be developed onto a product-specific in the business \n\ncompany current operational context: Sourcing raw materials, \n\nprocessing them, packaging and storage, promotion, selling and \n\ndistribution, while developing company\u2019s projects towards \n\nsustainability and social responsibility. \n\nType of \nresearch \n\nPhenomenological research by the means of Case study. \n\nNumber of \ncases \n\nOne pilot case study. \n\nStudy \nenvironment  \n\nCompany day-to-day business.

To achieve \n\nthis goal the research makes use of the sustainable marketing audit checklists, within the \n\nframework of sustainable marketing approach. \n\nThe use of audit checklists is widespread and is a common approach to classical \n\nmarketing audits. According to Brownlie (1993) it comprises the following advantages: \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n1) Using already audited and grounded as important issues to investigate; \n\n2) It assures no important issue is omitted; \n\n3) It encompasses background philosophy and theories, important for the goals of \n\nthe auditing process. Moreover, the use of checklists provides a simple scheme \n\nand complete data-set to compare to other audits and benchmark. \n\nNevertheless, a product-specific sustainable marketing audit is essentially a qualitative \n\nand interpretative approach to understand clearly the ecological burden posed by the \n\nproduct, due to its production, marketing and consumption; and determining the product\u2019s \n\nposition in the strategic environmental matrix in order to draw a suitable and effective \n\nsustainable marketing plan. Hence sustainable marketing audit to a product-specific \n\nshould be conducted by fully understanding each stage of the product (regarding PSLC) \n\nagainst P2 and R2 goals. \n\nThe present work does not conclude with a set of statistical analysis on the audit \n\nchecklists answers gathered, like Brownnlie (1993) proposed. It rather presents a relevant \n\ninterpretation of product (and company) level of sustainability commitment, or in other \n\nterms, the ecological impact of product\u2019s utility. Hence findings about resources use and \n\nwaste generation, became classified as strengths/weaknesses or opportunities/threats, \n\ndepending on the firm ability to implement realistic P2 and/or R2 solutions as a marketing \n\nresponse (Fuller, 1999). \n\n \n\n5.3 Qualitative study and content analysis \n\nThe use of content analysis method is especially adequate for the purpose of the present \n\nresearch due to its descriptive and exploratory nature, reinforced for the novelty of the \n\nframework applied. Content analysis is the logical method for such a qualitative research, \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\nsince it aims to interpret and gain full perception of a given reality or process dynamics \n\n(Krippendorf, 1980 and Weber, 1990). \n\nThe present exploratory work aims to position the product-specific in the P2/R2 strategic \n\nmatrix in order to determine the range of strategies available for planning an adequate \n\nsustainable marketing plan. However, since there are no prior works of the same nature \n\nregarding P2 and R2 positioning, or even a solid set of indicators to benchmark against, \n\nthus falls inevitably in the qualitative data analysis by means of relational analysis \n\ntowards gaining full understanding of the sequential stages of product, from the cradle to \n\ngrave, i.e. from green coffee to used capsule collection and dreg valorization. \n\nAs exploratory work, full description of the phenomena is critical inasmuch as further \n\nwork and research can be grounded on a robust management problem definition, \n\ncompletely documented and clearly explaining how each selected issue is related in the \n\nproduct's processes. \n\nMultiple sources of evidence were used to achieve comprehensive understanding of \n\nresponsibility and environmental policies implemented by DELTA. Primary main \n\ndocumental source was the annual reports from the company: accounting reports from \n\n2003 to 2009, and responsibility reports from 2004/2005, 2006/2007 and 2008/2009. \n\nAnother important primary source was the deep guided interviews with the Innovation \n\nand research manager from DELTA, using the audit checklists as a guide in order to fully \n\nunderstand each issue on its own, and in relation with the overall Delta Q production and \n\nmarketing processes, which resulted in more than six hours of tape recordings that were \n\nsubsequently analysed and registered in chapter 9. \n\nAccounting data was assembled in the form of summary tables (presented on chapter 12 \u2013 \n\nAttachments) covering balance sheet and P&amp;L8 account aggregates, followed by main \n\n                                                 \n8 P&amp;L stands for profit and losses. \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\nprofitability and financial indicators. This data set was brought for the report body and \n\nanalyzed in chapter 9 under graphical presentation for easier trend perception and \n\ncompany performance evaluation. \n\nSecondary documental sources like magazine articles, interviews and company press \n\nreleases were also used. They are listed in the bibliography and there enclosed copies in \n\nthe case study box. \n\n \n\n6 SUSTAINABILITY \n\nDespite sustainability being nowadays widespread from media to technical and academic \n\nworks, there is a large latitude for the term use. Therefore, a detailed review of the \n\nconcept and its evolution is further developed in order to restrain the concept definition \n\ncentral for present research.  \n\nIn the present work, the term \u201csustainability\u201d does not refer to the economic, tax, social \n\nsecurity or financial ability to self-support in following years. For this research, the term \n\nsustainability means the global ecosystem ability to regenerate and survive, despite the \n\nhuman activity's harmful impact on them. \n\nAs it will be further discussed, environmental sustainability can be positively impacted \n\nand enhanced trough incremental innovations and behaviour changes, as long as they are \n\nintegrated, designed and implemented from an early project stage. The necessary manner \n\nand framework for marketing management to accomplish such a goal is discussed in the \n\nfollowing chapters. \n\n \n\n6.1 The Corporate Social Responsibility \n\nRecent years have been fruitful in bringing into the focus of media, international \n\nconferences and legislation, issues related to CSR. One can find it everywhere, from the \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\nNGOs9 to the internationally academic production. At the time of this writing, Google \n\nlists 301.000 entries to the term \"Corporate Social Responsibility\u201d in Portuguese \n\nlanguage. The same search in English language returns no less than 7.300.000 entries. \n\nWhen one think of the meaning of the term, it seems clear that it refers to the \n\nresponsibility that companies should have in society. This is, regarding people. However, \n\npeople are the world! A company cannot be responsible for the world. Or, can it? To what \n\nextent could this responsibility belong to business companies? \n\nThe term \"corporate social responsibility\" was coined by H. R. Bowen in 1953, with a \n\nview of social obligation. In this early meaning, companies should pursue policies, take \n\ndecisions or follow the line of action which is desirable in terms of values and goals for \n\nthe society (Turker, 2009). In 1979, Archie B. Carroll set out three main areas of \n\nobligations in respect of CSR, resumed in the following table: \n\n \nTable 6.1 - Definition of corporate social responsibility \n\n1. Economic obligations- economically viable producing; \n\n2. Legal and ethical obligations - compliance with laws and recognition of social \nnorms and values; \n\n3. Philanthropic obligations- proactively return to society. \n\n \n\nIn the mid-nineties of the XX century, many authors have argued that the term \n\n\"obligation\" was insufficiently precise to be applied effectively in the management of \n\ncorporate social responsibility (Clarkson, 1995; Donaldson and Preston, 1995). Therefore, \n\nit was suggested that the companies would have to be accountable for society, not as a \n\n                                                 \n9\n NGO\u2019s \u2013 Non-governmental organizations are generally considered to be a non-state, non-profit, \n\nvoluntary organization. As a non-state entity, an NGO is generally independent from government \ninfluence and either not established by a government, or intergovernmental agreement, or, if \nestablished in such a manner, is not independent of such influence. As a non-profit organization, \nor \"nonprofits distributing,\" an NGO does not distribute profit to its partners. (NGO Handbook, \nhttp://www.ngohandbook.org/ \nindex.php?title= What_are_Non-Governmental_Organizations_(NGOs)%3F), 17/02/2011. \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\nwhole, but only to those who are directly or indirectly affected by the company's \n\noperations. They are called \"stakeholders\"10; Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) divided \n\nthem into four groups: \n\n \n\nTable 6.2 - Stakeholder groups \n\n1. Organizational - employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders; \n\n2. Community - local residents, special interest groups and generic; \n\n3. Regulators - local/national legislators and standards (at local, national, and \ninternational perspectives); \n\n4. Media Stakeholders. \n\n \n\nA more structured corporate social responsibility understanding was won and therefore, \n\nliable to be (better) managed. Still, business continues towards a concept which focuses \n\non the interests of the company (Jones, 1995), which lacks intrinsic motivation for the \n\nimplementation and enforcement, as an active operating and decision-making model. \n\nMeasures of flexibility towards employees or philanthropic activities and donations to \n\ncharities, may well be the only way a company has to act according to the social norms \n\nand value systems in each location and cannot move from a paternalistic expression of \n\ncorporate power (Swanson, 1995). \n\nThe various presented approaches regarding the concept of social responsibility \n\ndemonstrate the wide interpretive latitude that the concept still has, even after more than \n\nfifty years passed over its creation. Even though others have identified this gap (or flaw) \n\nand argued that the concept of social responsibility requires being better operationalized \n\n                                                 \n10\n\n Stakeholders - This concept refers to the idea that the company's operations depend on the interaction \nof various groups and individuals, whose result is greater than the sum of the parts and include: \ncustomers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, government, competitors and others (Charter, Martin; \nPeattie, Ken; Ottman, Jacqueline and Palonsky, Michael J. 2002). \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\nthrough the assessment and management of the environment, as a way of reaching a stage \n\nof pro-active social responsibility. (Wartick and Cochrane, 1985; Wood, Donna J. 1991). \n\nMoreover, the many definitions of CSR seem to wind up a redundancy, especially if one \n\ndefines marketing as the process of meeting the needs of consumers, where they want, \n\nwhich way they prefer, with the necessary information and the appropriate price to \n\nremunerate the factors involved in meeting these needs (Kotler and Keller, 2005). So the \n\ncorporate social responsibility is fulfilled by the prosecution of the marketing \n\nmanagement process by itself. Thus marketing management already should be aligned \n\nwith social responsibility and environmental protection objectives. \n\n \n\n6.2 Triple Bottom Line \n\nMore recently, with the advent of the so-called NGO\u2019s in the field of cooperation and \n\ndevelopment, it was possible to understand and operationalize the concept of CSR. Three \n\nguiding principles of the operation and management processes arise: \n\n1) Social - employees, customers, local communities, respect for legal and cultural \n\nvalues;  \n\n2) Respect for the environment; \n\n3) Economic - to maintain and ensure the economic viability/financial operations of \n\nthe company. \n\n \n\nIn short, those issues can be referred as TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE: People, Planet and \n\nProfit. \n\nMarc J. Epstein (2008) in his landmark book \"Making Sustainability Work\" presents the \n\ninterpretation of this approach by pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk's in relation to \n\nits business unit of biopharmaceuticals for diabetes: \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \nFigure 6.1 - Triple bottom line \n\n \nSource: Novo Nordisk's, 2005 Annual Report \n\n \n\nNovo Nordisk's \"search to conduct its business in an economically viable, socially \n\nresponsible and environmentally balanced, and believe, they will be a leader in diabetes \n\ncare, will create value for patients and their stakeholders.\u201d (Epstein 2008). \n\nAccording to Williams, E. (2008), CSR Europe, an organization that gathers and works \n\ndirectly with businesses companies, governments and other organizations concerned with \n\nsocial responsibility in Europe, sustainability has been the central concern of the actions \n\nand initiatives of CSR. \n\n \n\n6.3 Sustainability and Sustainable Development \n\nSo what is sustainability? The definition in the largest dictionary of the Portuguese \n\nlanguage: \"Novo Aur\u00e9lio, S\u00e9c. XXI\" tell us that sustainability is \"Sustainable Quality\". In \n\nturn, one of the definitions of \u201csustainable\u201d that interests the most in this research project, \n\ntells that it is \"what it can support\" or what \"it can keep more or less constant or stable for \n\na long time.\" Nevertheless, for the purposes of this research work, will be used the \n\ndefinition proposed by Brundtland Commission Report (1987) for the Committee on \n\nEnvironment and Development of the United Nations (Chapter 3, Paragraph 27): \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \u201cHumanity has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure \n\nthat it meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability \n\nof future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d \n\n \n\nFurthermore, the report casts a light for more detailed understanding, stating \u201cthe concept \n\nof sustainable development does imply limits \u2013 not absolute limits but limitations \n\nimposed by the present state of technology and social organization on environmental \n\nresources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities. \n\nHowever, technology and social organization can be both managed and improved\u2026\u201d  \n\nHence sustainable development aims to meet the needs and aspirations of the present \n\nwithout compromising the needs and aspirations of the future. Far from requiring the \n\ncessation of economic growth, it recognizes that the problems of poverty and \n\nunderdevelopment cannot be solved \u201c\u2026without a new era of growth ...\" (Brundtland \n\nReport, Chapter 3, Paragraph 28). \n\nThus, one can find a unique bridge between the need for ethical commitment of \n\nproduction operations and marketing decisions and business responsibility towards the \n\nenvironment, generally referred to as ecosystems and the imperatives of sustainable \n\ndevelopment. \n\nDuring the evolution of humanity, different models of consumption and production have \n\nevolved. Since the trade in spices arrived in Europe by caravans that crisscrossed the \n\ndeserts and mountains of near and far east and impeding in Europe by Genovese \n\nmerchants and ports. \n\nThe later entry of the Portuguese in this lucrative trading, launching the Cape route \n\n(former route of Good Hope cape, now Cape Town) allowed the reduction of spices price \n\nin Europe, as well as their consumption increase. \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\nFinally, with the industrial revolution of the steam engine and later the internal \n\ncombustion engine, there were no restrictions on production or scarcity of resources, and \n\nonly the economic power of markets limited their access to goods that they needed or \n\ndemanded (Smith, 1776). \n\nThe turn to the twentieth century, came to change this paradigm, although mankind only \n\nrealized that, on the last two decades of the century. \n\nAs the following figure evidence, the world population has suffered an explosion from the \n\nlast quarter of the nineteenth century, growing more than six times in just little over a \n\nhundred years. Estimating is currently circa 7.000 million and is projected at 9.200 \n\nmillion people by mid-century (Robinson, 1998 and US Census Bureau \u2013 International \n\nDatabase, 2010). \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 \u2013 World population evolution \n\n0,000\n\n1,000\n\n2,000\n\n3,000\n\n4,000\n\n5,000\n\n6,000\n\n7,000\n\n8,000\n\n1 500 1000 1500 1750 1875 1900 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\n\nW\no\n\nrl\nd\n\n P\no\n\np\nu\n\nla\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n M\n\nil\nli\n\no\nn\n\ns\n)\n\n \nSource: 1 to 1950 series: De Long, J.

Two major exogenous factors have \n\ncontributed: \n\n1) Technical and scientific development in conjunction with novel robust economic \n\nand management theories, which together made the way for spectacular business \n\nefficiency and national governments economic policy outcomes; and  \n\n2) The extraordinary production effort done by the United States of America, during \n\nSecond World War, and the replication of the formula later, for Europe \n\nreconstruction. \n\nThose factors together provided the ideal conditions for amazing economic and well fair \n\ngrowth of the so-called western democracies, starting 1950 as following figures clearly \n\nevidences: \n\nFigure 6.3 \u2013 World GDP evolution \n\n0\n\n10.000\n\n20.000\n\n30.000\n\n40.000\n\n50.000\n\n60.000\n\n70.000\n\n1 500 1000 1500 1750 1875 1900 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010\n\nW\no\n\nrl\nd\n\n G\nD\n\nP\n (\n\n1\n.0\n\n0\n0\n M\n\nil\nli\n\no\nn\n\n 1\n9\n9\n0\n C\n\no\nn\n\ns\nta\n\nn\nt \n\nIn\nte\n\nrn\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\na\nl \n\nU\nS\n\nD\n)\n\n \nSource: 1 to 1990 series: De Long, J.

According \n\nto Fuller (1999), dealing with these problems means finding solutions to problems arising \n\nfrom the following models of production and consumption that have become widespread \n\nacross the planet over the last hundred years: \n\n \n\nTable 6.3 - Issues to be managed by marketing \n\n1. Facilities - Operated in the environment by mining, logging, fisheries, \nintensive agriculture, among others; \n\n2. Production/Processing - goods processed in factories and consumer \ngoods/investment that fuel the trade and the global economy;  \n\n3. Waste - collective costs to industry, consumers, environment, societies \nand economies based on consumption and waste, generating pollution and \nnatural resource depletion and environmental destruction. They represent \nthe so-called \u201ceco-costs\u201d. \n\n \n\nThose production models could be translated into three basic questions: What it takes? \n\nWhat it makes? And what it wastes? \n\nThese are, according to Hawken (1993), the main challenges that companies have to face, \n\nand correspond inexorably to questions and issues that are manipulated by the processes \n\nof marketing management decisions. Not only the classical economic approach, assuming \n\ninfinite natural resources, thereby without any value, as neither the neo-classical theories, \n\ntrusting money supply and price dynamics to reflect upon markets the scarcity or \n\nabundance of a given resource, no one really considered the effective depletion of critical \n\nresources for economic and human kind survival, like water. Thus it was not taken into \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\naccount resource scarcity or further on the outcomes of consumer needs satisfaction: the \n\nassociated waste production streams. \n\n \n\n6.4 Sustainable Marketing  \n\nThe marketing has to embrace the whole issue of sustainability and make their processes \n\nand activities sustainable. Like ecological systems in homeostasis11, organisms and plants \n\nusing minerals, water and other organisms in continuous and interdependent processes \n\nthat generate waste and are further processed into food and fuel for a new cycle. \n\nThus, marketers must operate under the same principles. Its processes consume resources \n\nand generate waste, while delivering value and benefits to consumers and organizations. \n\nNow, a concern with environmental/ecological in order to maintain its balance \n\n(homeostasis) or even enrichment, is arising and gaining social, business and \n\ngovernments attention12. \n\nThe term \"Sustainable Marketing\" was coined by Sheth and Parvatiyar in 1995 and tried \n\nto identify the manner and mean to reconcile economic, ecological and environmental \n\nissues, through the reinvention of production systems and the products themselves (Fuller, \n\n1997). Other terms and names have been used, such as \"Ecological Marketing\" (Henion, \n\n1976)\", Green Marketing\" (Ottman, 1993), \"Environmental Marketing\" (Coddington, \n\n1993), \"Eco-Marketing\" (Fuller and Butler 1994) among others, which only contribute for \n\nblurring in the emerging field of marketing science (Fuller, 1999). \n\nIn this research work is used the definition proposed by Donald A. Fuller (1999) for it is \n\nthe best fitted to structure the approach to the new paradigm of sustainability, and because \n\n                                                 \n11\n\n Homeostasis \u2013 Auto regulatory property of a system or organism that allows keeping the equilibrium \nstate of its main variables or its environment (Novo Aur\u00e9lio \u2013 S\u00e9c. XXI, 1999). \n\n12\n Adapted from \"Technology for a sustainable future\", National Science and Technology Council, USA \n(1994). \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\nit represents a natural development of the science of marketing and does not constitute a \n\ndisruption with the analytical models already established. \n\nSustainable Marketing is the process of [product] planning, implementation and \n\ndevelopment of price control, products/services promotion and distribution, in order to \n\nsatisfy the following three criteria: \n\n \n\nTable 6.4 - Criteria to be met by sustainable marketing \n\n1. Meeting the needs of consumers; \n\n2. Achieving the goals and objectives of the companies; \n\n3. The processes developed and used are compatible with ecosystems. \n\n \n\nCompatible systems of production and marketing with respect for the environment require \n\nthe integration of strategies and policies for the management of waste from production \n\nprocesses and trade, for pollution prevention (P2) and resource recovery (R2). In this \n\nsense they face directly with the so-called \"eco-costs\" in the sense of their elimination or \n\nreduction, from a standpoint of marketing strategies developed by companies. \n\n \n\n6.4.1 P2 and R2 goals \n\nThe P2 goals can be achieved through preventive measures introduced in the marketing \n\nstrategies and policies: waste management and its production towards its reduction or \n\nelimination in the first place. In this way, it contributes decisively to the reduction of \n\nresources used, reducing the eco-costs, present and future and contributing to the \n\nachievement of goals R2.  \n\nThe R2 objectives are essentially corrective actions arising from audits of sustainable \n\nmarketing, identifying the need for reengineering of the product, packaging, or the \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\nlogistics of distribution (traditional or reverse) and all channels and other entities involved \n\nin distribution networks. \n\nWhen a company is to launch a new product in accordance with the sustainable marketing \n\nframework, it\u2019s in the position to assess the potential pollution generated by product \n\nsourcing, production, distribution and consumption, and the resources consumed by the \n\nwhole process. If the product is high natural resources consuming or very pollutant (for all \n\nstages or in a few), sustainable marketing provide the tools for management to \n\nstrategically change product profile and steer pollution reducing or/and reduce resources \n\nconsuming intensity. \n\nAlmost the same rationale can be applied to a product already in the market. Sustainable \n\nmarketing framework provides the means to identify and develop corrective actions, in \n\norder to reduce the pollution generation and resource consuming intensity. \n\nUnder a stand point of sustainable marketing, goals P2 and R2 (as basic sustainable \n\ndevelopment strategies) imply production and trading operations development (or \n\nrestructuration) in a way that do not compromise ecosystems. In consequence, from \n\ndemand side of the markets, begins to emerge the term \"sustainable consumption\" \n\n(Willium and Goluke 1992; Charter, Peattie, Palonsky and Ottman, 2002), that also calls \n\nfor a paradigm shift on decision-making processes and models of consumer behaviour, \n\nwhich are clearly outside the scope of this investigation.  \n\nNevertheless, worthwhile to mention, even briefly, new sustainable marketing mission \n\nwhich, according to Sheth and Parvatiyar (1995), can be resumed as: \n\n1) Redirect customer choices by shifting consumer attention from product benefits to \n\nproduct plus environmental benefits; \n\n2) Reorienting marketing-mix by implementing the decisions which will materialize \n\nas environmental protection; \n\n3) Reorganizing marketing channels, both supply side and demand side. \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\nOnly by aligning missions, goals, sustainable marketing planning and true commitment to \n\necosystem boundaries, is possible to effectively implement sustainable strategies and \n\nevolve for environmental stewardship companies. \n\n \n\n6.4.2 Waste Management  \n\nIn 1974, the Senator from Virginia, Jennings Randolph said before the Subcommittee on \n\nEnvironmental Pollution of the U.S. Senate: \"The waste, involving more than what we \n\ncall waste. The energy crisis (...) and the scarcity of raw materials make it urgent to \n\ndevelop a system of resource recovery. \"(Ginter, Peter M. and Starling, Jack M., 1978). \n\nTwo decades after, EPA defined pollution prevention (P2) as the key strategy for \n\nachieving sustainable development (Fuller 1996, et al). Another decade has passed and a \n\nstudy by Yale University places the waste (solid and gaseous) management on top of the \n\nissues to be managed by the environmental planning and management system of the \n\nVancouver county hall, like presented in following figure: \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 - Sustainable pyramid from Vancouver county hall \n\n \n\nSource: Adapted from Shane, A. M. and Graedel, T. E. 2000, Yale University. \n\n \n\nPollution resulting from production and consumption of goods in terms of waste creates \n\nspecial constraints, not only for its own production (resources invested and associated \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\ncosts), and their collection and are in addition to the problem, increasing air pollution \n\n(transport) and subsequent treatment or disposal. Creating thereby greater impact on \n\nenvironment quality and making waste treatment appear on the first line of the \n\nmanagement and control model that Shane and Graedel of Yale University applied to \n\nVancouver13 City. \n\n \n\nThe traditional waste management   \n\nThe traditional waste management model is usually concentrated in the collection, \n\ntreatment and disposal of such waste as much as possible (depending on the technical and \n\nfinancial resources available). However, this approach is primarily related to R2 goals. In \n\nother words, it gives no attention to the processes and decisions ahead of waste \n\nproduction. Now, sustainable marketing, above all, aims to prevent and avoid the \n\necological degradation under a P2 perspective. \n\nThe generation of waste, according to Fuller (1999), occurs when the consumer (private \n\nor business) does not give immediate economic value to the materials that remain after the \n\nsatisfaction of their needs. Is the typical case of cans or plastic bottles, both used to \n\ntransport and deliver a variety of liquid materials. \n\nWaste generation also occurs as a consequence of industrial processes, whether in the \n\nform of gases released into the atmosphere, or in the form of effluent into water systems. \n\nWaste processing can occur at source. This is right after the consumption and consists in \n\nthe act of separation of \"household waste\" in the categories of organic, metal and plastic \n\nor paper and subsequent deposition in the ecological point of collection. \n\nAt the industrial level, waste processing can occur by separation of packaging materials of \n\nraw materials and other inputs used in the production process (such as cardboard, shrink \n\n                                                 \n13 Canadian city with little over 2 million inhabitants in 2000.

However, there are still many towns, cities and \n\nfactory systems without waste classification and collection, which results in a larger \n\nenvironmental impact of the later stage of processing and disposal of such wastes \n\n(whether from domestic or from industrial and commercial sources). \n\nThe waste collection and transportation involves collecting and carrying waste from the \n\nsource to processing plants such as Valorsul15, to reduce its environmental impact before \n\nthe deposition at landfills. On the other hand, it can also be processed for other industrial \n\nprocesses, such as the burning of toxic waste by cement industry. \n\nThe residues that are not processed at the source typically involve transferring to other \n\nentity specialists in processing certain categories of materials and equipment. It\u2019s the case \n\nof automobile tires and waste oil. These entities are specialists in the treatment of these \n\nmaterials or in the selection and collection of components for reconditioning for specific \n\nprocessing, or by its value or for its danger. \n\nThe final disposal of waste is the stage where the waste will not suffer any further \n\nprocessing, selection or additional recovery. It is normally the land filling prepared for the \n\npurpose, or the release into the atmosphere or the sea and estuaries, which are expected to \n\nhave the lesser environmental impact.   \n\nThe following figure shows those stages sequences and articulation, under the traditional \n\nperspective of waste management and recent evolution to integrated waste management \n\napproach: \n\n \n                                                 \n14 Sociedade Ponto Verde SA is a private society in association with Portuguese state, non-profit and \n\nwas incorporated in November 1996. Its mission is to promote the collection, recovery and recycling \nof packaging waste at the national level. (http://www.pontoverde.pt, 18/07/2010). \n\n15 Valorsul, SA is the company responsible for processing and recovery of some 750 tons of municipal \nsolid waste produced per year in the municipalities of Amadora, Lisbon, Loures, Odivelas and Vila \nFranca de Xira. (http://www.valorsul.pt/default.asp?SqlPage=content&amp;CpContentId=15051, \n09/08/2010). \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\nFigure 6.6 - Traditional vs. Integrated waste management \n\n \n\nSource: Adapted from Fuller, 1999. \n\n \n\nIntegrated waste management \n\nAccording to Fuller (1999), the first priority of integrated waste management is the \n\nelimination or reduction of waste at source, as the P2 goals. It is therefore, a proactive \n\nstrategy for resource conservation and elimination or reduction of waste production \n\nthrough a preventive approach (marketing strategy), like product design with \n\nenvironmental concerns, which is called Environmental Design16. \n\nThe second priority of integrated waste management has to do with the R2 goals and \n\ninvolves the capture of energy, materials and components of waste streams for future use \n\n(Fuller, Allen and Glaser, 1996). That is to be used as resources for other processes. \n\nThe concept to retain is the close proximity between this hierarchy of integrated waste \n\nmanagement following the P2 and R2 targets, with the design for environment, which \n\ntrough planning and development, is to conduct from stage to stage to increasingly small \n\nwaste streams. \n                                                 \n16 Also known as DFE \u2013 Design for environment. \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\nThus, the waste final disposal will have to deal with smaller quantities, less dangerous and \n\ntherefore, allowing more effectively handling and processing. One can implement \n\nstrategies derived from the goals R2, aiming to lower environmental impacts, contributing \n\nto the restoration of ecological systems. \n\n \n\n6.5 Sustainable marketing strategic decisions \n\n\u201cSustainable marketing is an extension of, not a radical departure from, traditional \n\nmarketing management practice.\u201d (Fuller, 1999). This extension is achieved trough the \n\naddition of new strategic decision boundaries, new criteria to evaluate available \n\nalternatives and new strategies like P2 (Pollution Prevention) and R2 (Resource \n\nRecovery) which are to be understand \u201cas logical responses to the need to develop \n\nproduction-consumption practices that preserve and enhance the ecosystems within which \n\nwe live.\u201d (Fuller, 1999). \n\nThe following chapters present a detail discussion on this model extension, and the \n\nintegration framework to evolve from traditional marketing management to sustainable \n\nmarketing management. \n\n \n\n6.5.1 The traditional marketing management model \n\nThe development of models is a very useful tool to identify and analyze the interactions \n\nbetween the various component elements and limits, and to determine influences of the \n\nmarketing process of decision making. The use of models, in this case for sustainable \n\nmarketing (towards sustainable economic performance), is a powerful opportunity to \n\ncreate enduring value for multiple stakeholders, according to Epstein, Marc J. (Making \n\nSustainability Work, 2008). \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\nBoth marketing (traditional and sustainable) processes approach problems in a similar \n\nway, through the management cycle (planning, execution and control). But the results are \n\nsubstantially different, especially when we consider the externalities and the decision \n\ncriteria in line with a marketing strategy (Fuller, 1999). \n\nFor present research, a marketing model describes the necessary inputs, processes, \n\noutputs, constraints and outcomes to develop and implement a marketing strategy \n\n(Epstein, 2008). The following figure evidence the traditional marketing management \n\ndecisions model: \n\n \n\nFigure 6.7 - Traditional marketing management model \n\n \n\nSource: Adapted from Boone and Kurtz1992; McCarthy and Perreault 1993 et al. \n\n \n\nIn the traditional marketing decision model, marketing managers manipulate: (1) the \n\ntarget market, (2) the company's resources, (3) the variables of the marketing mix, which \n\nthey control, and (4) the external constraints (Boone and Kurtz 1992; McCarthy and \n\nPerreault 1993), like the economy performance, competition intensity, technology and \n\nlegal and fiscal context. They do it within (5) decision criteria defined by (6) marketing \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\nchannels immediately available. Marketers decide on what to do and why (planning), \n\ndecide how, who, where and when to do it (implementation) and finally monitor the \n\nprogress of the actions implemented (control) and introduce corrective measures (when \n\nnecessary) in order to achieve the company goals. \n\nMacroeconomics factors draw the boundaries of marketing management activities outside \n\nthe company. Market pressure demand in the context with culture and level of economic \n\nand consumerism, determines the opportunities marketing manager pursue in order to \n\nachieve business goals. \n\n \n\n6.5.2 The sustainable marketing management model \n\nIn the sustainable marketing model, three new features emerge: (1) the ecosystems' \n\nintegration into marketing management processes boundaries; (2) the introduction of a \n\nthird criterion on marketing management decisions, in order to achieve ecosystems and \n\nenvironmental marketing management decisions compatibility; and finally (3) the \n\nintroduction of the Product-System Life-Cycle (PSLC) concept, before facing the \n\nboundaries of marketing channels/distribution networks readily available. \n\nThe PSLC concept, which will be fully detailed in the next chapter, can be resumed as the \n\nproduct\u2019s waste and scrap generation cycle, from its production and distribution, to its \n\nconsumption by the end-user. \n\nThe context of ecosystems is a border that should be respected as far as possible. The \n\necological footprint17 of the strategy to implement can be evaluated by the fundamental \n\nequation: I = PAT18. The same applies to the compatibility with the ecosystem or \n\n                                                 \n17 Corresponds to the trail left by human activities of production and marketing in the environment and \n\nwhich can be seen by pollution, greenhouse gases, depletion of fisheries in the oceans, deforestation \nof the Amazon among many other examples (Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees, 1990). \n\n18 In the early 1970 Ehrlich and Holdren conceived the equation by identifying the factors that generate \nenvironmental impact. Impact (I) is expressed in terms of resource depletion or accumulation of \nwaste. P (population) refers to the human population size. Affluence (A) refers to the consumption \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n\nenvironment, as a criterion for deciding on the elements of the marketing mix to use and \n\nmanipulate in order to produce value, both for end-customers and for the company, \n\nwithout harming ecological balance. \n\nThat new criterion and boundaries provide a whole new mind-set to consider available \n\nmarketing strategies and operational decisions, on the array of marketing mix variables. It \n\ncan determine the choice for certain distribution networks, or a different approach on \n\ncommunication and advertising campaigns, or even drive different options regarding \n\npackaging and warehousing. \n\nThe new approach of sustainable marketing management evidence those new boundaries \n\nfor marketing decisions regarding environmental impact and waste generation \n\nmanagement, as the following figures shows: \n\n \nFigure 6.8 - Sustainable marketing management model \n\n \nSource: Adapted from Fuller, Donald A. (1999) \n\n                                                                                                                                               \nlevel of the population calculated as GNP per capita. Technology (T) refers to processes used to \nobtain resources and transforming them into consumer goods and waste (Marian R. Chertow, School \nof Forestry and Environmental Studies, Journal of Industrial Ecology, Volume 4, Number 4, 2001). \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nThe new frontier for a market access called PSLC (Product-System Life-Cycle) is based \n\non the concept of integrated waste management (Fuller 1996), which will be detailed \n\nlater. The PSLC context of analysis (framework) for the marketing-mix faces new criteria \n\nwith double results. On one hand, the new approach to waste management (or the \n\nproduction process or the process of distribution and consumption under the perspective \n\nof waste generation) can be a source of: \n\n1) Differentiation or cost reduction; \n\n2) Competitive marketing or industry advantages (correlated with integrated waste \n\nmanagement). \n\n \n\n6.5.3 The Product-System Life-Cycle (PSLC) \n\nThe Product-System Life-Cycle was early proposed by Donald A Fuller, Jeff Allen and \n\nMark Glaser in 1996 and brings together two major constructs concerning marketing \n\nmanagement and waste management trough sustainable marketing decisions, which are \n\nresources life-cycle and marketing channels: \n\n \n\n1) Resource life-cycle is the cradle-to-grave materials flow trough five nominal \n\nstages: (1) raw materials extraction, (2) material component manufacturing, (3) \n\nfinished products manufacturing, (4) product\u2019s use/consumption and (5) waste \n\ndisposal which, after all, is also present in precedent stages, as each one of them \n\ngenerates its own waste stream. The flows stages 1 to 4 consist of resources (or \n\nmanufactured products) that are either consumed, incorporated or discharged as \n\nwaste (Keoleian and Menerey, 1993). \n\n2) Marketing channels are a network of organizations (or companies) positioned in \n\nsuch a manner that brings at reach the products demanded by end-customers \n\nmarkets in the store (place), at the moment (time), in the quantity (selling unit), \n\nand price preferred by consumers (Coughlan, Andersen, Stern and El-Ansary, \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n2001). Marketing channels network decisions are defined as the successive \n\ntransactions from production until end-customer delivery for consumption, \n\nfulfilling business company\u2019s targets of doing so in a profitability manner, for all \n\nnetwork\u2019s participants.  \n\nMarketing channels decisions regarding occurrences prior to initial product\u2019s \n\nprocesses stages or post-consumption are usually outside the scope of \n\nmanagement (Fuller, 1999). A yoghourt marketing manager has no concern on \n\nwhat happens to milk-cows after reproducing age. Neither care for pollutant \n\nemissions from crude processing into yoghourt-cup polymer, nor (traditionally) \n\ncare less for the yoghourt-cup terminal disposal after yoghourt consumption. \n\n \n\nAs Fuller (1999) well emphasises, above constructs taken separately lack to offer an \n\nintegrated vision over resources\u2019 life-cycle and business companies objectives. The PSLC \n\nframework represents a merger of the two concepts that captures the comprehensive, \n\ncradle-to-grave coverage necessary to assess ecological problems while factoring the \n\n[critical] element of business purpose. \n\nThe PSLC consists of five stages and its interdependent flows of resources as raw \n\nmaterials, energy and other inputs needed for production, distribution and consumption of \n\ngoods and the flow of waste generated in those processes. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\nFigure 6.9 - Product-system Life-cycle \n\n \n\nSource: Adapted from Fuller, Donald A, Jeff Allen and Mark Glaser, 1996. \n \n\nThe stages 1 to 3 correspond to the flows of raw materials, energy and other materials \n\nneeded for production, processing and marketing of goods to target end-markets of \n\nconsumers/users. The purpose of the system, the consumption of goods by consumers and \n\nindustry as end users, corresponds to the stage 4. Stage 5 concerns the integrated waste \n\nmanagement of the whole process of production, distribution and consumption. \n\nDepending on the implementation of strategies for selection of waste, lead waste stranded \n\nfor the most appropriate solutions to the homeostasis of ecological systems. Through \n\nstrategies of recovery of waste back to integrate them into the production process as \n\nresources of a similar kind or as energy or subsidiary materials, complementary to the \n\nrespective production processes, as is the case of cartons, bottles of glass or PET \n\n(polyethylene terephthalate)19. \n\n                                                 \n19 Polyethylene terephthalate is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in \n\nsynthetic fibres; beverage, food and other liquid containers; thermoforming applications; and \nengineering resins often in combination with glass fibre. \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\nThe PSLC provides a perfect insight under a marketing management perspective, on first \n\nand second Commoner\u2019s law (1971)20 which states respectively that everything is \n\nconnected with everything else and everything must go somewhere. \n\nThe central implications are that each stage of PSLC is supportive of the next stage, and \n\nare interdependent of each other, and the decisions made in one stage have a direct \n\nrepercussion in following stages (Fuller, et al, 1996). PSLC model can be summarized in \n\nthe form of three main streams, like detailed in the following table: \n\n \n\nTable 6.5 - PSLC stream flows \n\n1. Midstream flow consists of main product's marketing strategy that \n\ndetermines the characteristics of products and production, forms and \n\npackaging for the marketing of consumption goods by end-users and \n\nultimately determines the volume and quality of consumption waste \n\ngeneration. \n\nParticipants of this flow master subsequent marketing decisions with real \n\nimpact on the overall waste generation chain originated by customer \n\nmarket needs satisfaction. Proper PSLC product\u2019s profile can facilitate \n\nand ensure the company\u2019s achievement of P2 and R2 goals, since it can \n\ndetermine the product DFE, allow deeper insight and interpretation of \n\nend-customers needs and behaviour and projects environment friendly \n\ndistribution channels systems. \n\n2. Downstream flow of waste generated over the distribution networks, \n\nwhich play a key role in the process of waste production and \n\nmanagement. Decisions within the context of this flow may well \n\ndetermine lesser pollutant emissions, resources consumption or \n\ncomponents assembled, translating into more value for company \n\nobjectives attaining and can be a source of important marketing \n\n                                                 \n20 Ecologist Barry Commoner wrote The Closing Circle. Commoner summarized the basics of ecology \n\ninto what he termed \u201claws of ecology\u201d (1) Everything is connected to everything else; (2) Everything \nhas to go somewhere or there is no such place as away; (3) Everything is always changing; (4) There \nis no such thing as a free lunch, (5) Everything has limits. \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\ndifferentiation advantages. \n\n3. Upstream flow of reverse distribution networks and waste management \n\nensures their return to productive processes/processing, but now as \n\nresources. Either to be recycled into a new resource-cycle or to be \n\nconsumed as raw material, by-materials or under the form of energy. In \n\nmany cases reverse channels can become a profit centre for the company, \n\nsince it ensures transport returns occupied, or by selling to other \n\ncompanies, what under product\u2019s own perspective is a scrap but can be a \n\nraw material or energy source for other product processes. \n\n \n\nAccording to Fuller (1999) the PSLC model can be considered as the first step for \n\nsustainable marketing strategy implementation, to delineate a product\u2019s PSLC from which \n\nwill come an understanding of waste burdens generated by interrelated decisions of \n\nmidstream, downstream and upstream sector participants. Although no individual \n\norganization or end-customer  can be held as responsible for waste production from other \n\nsystem participants, clearly  the totality of system\u2019s waste must be understood [and \n\nassessed] if it is to be moderated trough coordinated sustainable marketing efforts. \n\nFrom PSLC follows the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) which is defined by EPA as a \n\ntechnique to assess the environmental aspects and potential impacts associated with a \n\nproduct, process, or service, by:  \n\n1) Compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental \n\nreleases; \n\n2) Evaluating the potential environmental impacts associated with identified inputs \n\nand releases; \n\n3) Interpreting the results to help you make a more informed decision. \n\nAccording t Fuller (1999) LCA \u201cattempts to add flesh, bones and sinew to the bare \n\nbones of PSLC framework.\u201d Is a deep accounting, understanding and measuring process \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\nof all waste streams and resources used for a certain product process, resulting on \n\ncomprehensive profiling and evaluating of ecological burden. \n\nWhile LCA tracks very close the product\u2019s environmental performance and impact, it \n\nlacks the global perspective of multistage consumption or waste generation. Then, far \n\nfrom replacing or being an alternative framework to PSLC, LCA is a necessary \n\ncomplementary one. \n\nSince the scope of present work lies within preliminary and qualitative research, LCA \n\nwill not be further detailed. However, it must be used ahead, if one endeavours to \n\ndevelop a full sustainable marketing plan. \n\n \n\n6.6 Sustainable marketing strategies \n\nAs discussed earlier sustainable marketing is an evolution of traditional marketing \n\nmanagement to respond to the new challenges that business and mankind are facing in \n\nrelation to ecosystems unbalance and resource depletion due to production-consumption \n\nmodels that we have been using. \n\nThe strategies available under the sustainable marketing model are also extensions of the \n\nprevious model, expanded now, by the P2 (Pollution Prevention) and R2 (Resource \n\nRecovery) new basic goals. Which result in four sets of product strategies: \n\n1) Product dematerialization; \n\n2) Environmental design concerns; \n\n3) Proactive sustainability; \n\n4) Sustainable growth. \n\nThese sets of available sustainable strategies are discussed in detail in following chapters. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n6.6.1 Reconsidering the products in the form of services \n\nDematerialization is a result that occurs when fewer resources (raw materials, the \n\nsubsidiary and/or energy) are consumed to produce the same benefits (or equivalent) to \n\nconsumers, thereby reducing the impact of the marketing process in the environment \n\n(Fuller 1999). P2 and R2 basic strategies of sustainable marketing, contribute directly to \n\nthis result by reducing the resources required and waste/scrap generated in the production \n\nprocess for a given level of output. \n\nAnother form of dematerialization has to do with the packaging materials. Reengineering \n\nthe packaging together with new types of logistics (storage and distribution), can bring \n\nvery significant reductions in costs and waste. This is a sustainable marketing strategy, \n\nwith an optimized PSLC perspective, of integrated waste management.   \n\nNevertheless, according to Kotler and Keller (2005) customers seek to maximize its \n\nvalue, within the limits imposed by the costs. The value to customers/consumers is the \n\ndifference between the evaluation that customers make of all the benefits, and the cost \n\n(consumption) of a product or service. Then consumers look essentially for the benefits of \n\nproducts and not the actual product for itself (Fuller 1999). In this sense, it opens a wide \n\nworld of creativity in which companies can spend the focus of its manufacturing and \n\nmarketing operations to contracted services over time, as is the case of companies like \n\n\"Automobile Leasing\" whose clients do not get the ownership of the car, but the benefits \n\nof its use, depending on the mileage contracted.   \n\n \n\n6.6.2 Design for Environment (DFE) \n\nAccording to Graedel and Allenby (1995) the term design for the environment (DFE) was \n\nborn within industrial product design to describe the attributes or components that are \n\npositive for the environment. However, company decisions on marketing-mix variables \n\nare reflected directly in the production of waste under managed constraints arising from \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\nP2 strategies, or facilitating the role of recycling, according to R2 goals. Then all areas of \n\nintervention of marketer\u2019s management decisions must be guided by the principle of \n\ndesign for the environment. \n\n \n\nProduct \n\nThe product concept and design directly determines the resources and processes to be \n\nused. These are the factors determining the size, characteristics and value of the PSLC \n\nwaste streams (Fuller, 1999). \n\nAccording to Devashish Pujari and Gilian Wright21, to effectively achieve DFE \n\ncompanies should perform a pre-design research to ensure meeting all new product\u2019s \n\nenvironmental requirements and guarantee successful new DFE product marketing. \n\nThe pre-design research consists in:  \n\n1. Initial screening to learn and evaluate environmental needs by end-consumers and \n\necological stakeholders; \n\n2. Preliminary market assessment for market size appraisal, segments, estimate \n\nmarket growth rates and to gain competition insight; \n\n3. Market research to understand customer\u2019s needs and wants in relation to \n\nenvironmental value and how purchase behaviour was altered regarding the new \n\nneeds; \n\n4. Environmental and business analysis to determine environmental company \n\nresources and R&amp;D capabilities and the needs to obtain new resources or \n\ncompetencies, both internal or through partnerships and to estimate new product\u2019s \n\necological impacts (resource use and pollutant production intensity); \n\n5. Financial analysis to budget investments and expected returns, funding needs and \n\ninvestment planning; \n\n                                                 \n21\n In Charter, Martin and Polonsky, Michael J. (1999), Greener Marketing: A global perspective \n\non greening marketing practice, Greenleaf Publishing Limited, Shefield, UK, pg. 114. \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n6. Concept definition where final product\u2019s DFE requisites are defined such as \n\nenvironmental performance, new product\u2019s benefits, ways of terminal disposal, \n\npackaging and distribution requisites. \n\n \n\nPricing process \n\nThis is not an intrinsically waste generator process. It, nevertheless, should be a reflection \n\nand an expression of proposed environmental value embedded supporting development of \n\nthe product's sustainable marketing strategy and respective marketing mix. It must \n\ntherefore internalize the eco-costs resulting from the optimization of PSLC relative to the \n\nmidstream, waste downstream and recycling upstream. \n\n \n\nDistribution Networks  \n\nDetermine the composition, intensity of market coverage and functional capabilities of the \n\nnetworks that are necessary to link product with target markets (Fuller, 1999). They are \n\nthe main agent of waste packing production, as well as air pollution and fuel \n\nconsumption, drive the need and the physical distribution of products, and also hold a \n\nhigh proportion of PSLC. \n\n \n\nPromotion \n\nNot being the biggest area of waste production, communication campaigns and \n\npromotional events and demonstrations must be specially designed and evaluated for \n\nwaste generation minimizing. Many times is a function very constrained by prior \n\nmarketing decisions. So, it must be considered with equal importance when defining the \n\nmarketing variables mix. Then it can fully play its role of communicating clear and \n\neffectively to end-customer markets product\u2019s concept, central benefits and environmental \n\nperformance or low impact. \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\n6.6.3 Proactive strategies for sustainable marketing \n\nTaking into consideration basic P2 and R2 goals it is possible to draw two major sets of \n\nsustainable marketing strategies. The first set deals with P2 range of pollution prevention \n\npossible strategies. The second set covers R2 range of available resource recovery options \n\nto operationalize true sustainable marketing plans. \n\n \n\nP2 - Pollution Prevention \n\nAccording to USA\u2019s federal environmental protection agency (EPA), pollution prevention \n\n(P2) is reducing or eliminating waste at the source by modifying production processes, \n\npromoting the use of non-toxic or less-toxic substances, implementing conservation \n\ntechniques, and re-using materials rather than putting them into the waste stream.22. \n\nP2 strategy is the main contribution to the effectiveness of a product\u2019s strategic \n\nsustainable marketing plan. Its impact at all levels of the PSLC, and the decisions of the \n\nmarketing mix, define the scope of critical targets associated with it. The P2 strategy and \n\ntargets are unquestionably medium to long term and are more effective the sooner they \n\nare considered in the process of marketing planning. This strategy applies mainly to \n\nproducts and production processes. \n\n \n\nP2 - Products \n\nThe products are the result of production processes and are moved along the distribution \n\nnetworks, but unlike the processes that generate waste and rubbish, products will \n\nthemselves be a waste in the future, either by its consumption, either in terms of waste \n\npacking as either old or even by the termination of its functionality or benefits. \n\n                                                 \n22 EPA \u2013 Environmental Protection Agency http://www.epa.gov/p2/, 17/03/2011. \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\nThus P2 goals related to products are about designing products that minimize waste \n\ngeneration over the production and distribution flow to its consumption by the end-\n\ncustomers.  \n\nSo this strategy focuses on: (1) selection of materials and product components; (2) \n\namount of material (and resources) used in its production and packaging; (3) implications \n\nof those choices for their use, durability and deposition after losing its usefulness - i.e. \n\nincreasing its useful life; (4) minimization of waste/rubbish resulting from the \n\nuse/consumption; and (5) the potential to change the way the consumer obtains \n\nutility/benefits in their consumption to be more compatible with the ecosystems and \n\nreduce the environmental impact. \n\n \n\nP2 - Production and distribution processes \n\nThe activities involved in the production of goods and materials and their movement \n\nthrough the distribution system are ultimately a set of transformation processes on the \n\nresources (or raw materials) and connected with a marketing purpose which embodies \n\ntime, place and benefits for its possession or transaction (Fuller 1999). The design flow of \n\nPSLC clearly shows this chain of processes of resource consumption, production, trade \n\nand the consequent generation of waste/rubbish. \n\nSo P2 goals can be met when production processes and distribution take place in the \n\nreengineering of production systems and distribution operations, to reduce the resources \n\nconsumed and waste generated in the production process, logistics (Inbound and \n\noutbound) and along the distribution networks until the end-customer satisfies their needs. \n\n \n\nR2 - Resource Recovery \n\nThe second priority resulting from the integrated waste management approach in \n\nsustainable marketing is the recovery of waste. Because current technology cannot \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\nachieve the level of \"zero waste in production\", those can be minimized but not entirely \n\npreventable. They should therefore be addressed in the context of sustainable marketing \n\nbecause: (1) all products sooner or later will reach the end of its useful life; (2) will \n\nalways be necessary packing materials and transport - albeit small ones; (3) the very laws \n\nof physics (underlying processes) require that the transformations the raw materials are \n\nsubject to will always generate some sort of waste. \n\nThe R2 strategy can therefore be described as the process through which products, \n\nmaterials (resources) and energy are routinely recaptured in waste streams and reinstated \n\nagain in the cycle of production, distribution and consumption. This process is \n\nimplemented by distribution reverse channels as evidenced by the upstream flow of PSLC \n\nframework. So R2 strategy can be achieved through the reuse of products, materials \n\nrecycling and processing of materials. \n\n \n\nR2 - Reuse of products \n\nThe many possible approaches of this strategy are always based on the type of product \n\nconcerned and its ability to be modified or refurbished to be re-marketed and \n\nconsumed/used. This approach is distinct from the strategy P2 \u2013 Product, due to being \n\nconsidered as product life-cycle extension. Here is considered a succession of \n\nconsumption cycles with equivalent or equal benefits. Its achievement is evident in the \n\n\"triple R\": Reconstruction, Reconditioning and Repair. Most common (and not a novelty \n\nfrom sustainable paradigm) example for R2 goal enforcement is reusable bottles of beer \n\nor wine, fallen into oblivion on last decades of the twentieth century. In this case, a prize \n\nvalue was attributed to end-customer when the bottle was returned to marketing channel, \n\nperforming a reverse flow from stores to production plant, for washing and refilling. It \n\nstands for a perfect example of PSLC model, with a correct pricing process which \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n\nassigned a price to the empty bottle to stimulate the end-customer to proactively return it \n\nto the stream, what otherwise would be a waste for terminal disposal. \n\n \n\nR2 - Recycling Materials  \n\nThe recycling of materials through the capture of large quantities of products and \n\nmaterials from the waste stream of PSLC, which are then subject to reduction and \n\nphysical changes that make them return to the stage of raw (or subsidiary/components) \n\nmaterials, completely free from the product\u2019s characteristics and benefits or the physical \n\nforms which was originally built. After recycling, these materials became resources and \n\ncompete directly with the raw materials at first use, either in quality or in value, thus \n\ncreating alternative resource material sources for industrial production, since it could be \n\nguaranteed: \n\n1) Continuous flow of supply; \n\n2) Use of stable distribution channels with reverse logistics (stage 5 of PSLC); \n\n3) Recycled material market development and maintenance. \n\n \n\nR2 -Waste material processing \n\nTransformation of raw materials involves waste processing through thermal processes \n\n(incineration and/or combustion), chemical or biological agents who transform the \n\noriginal materials in alternative or even new materials. \n\n \n\n6.6.4 Sustainable marketing growth strategies \n\nThe natural and physical environment, traditionally discussed as an external influence on \n\nthe process and content of managerial decision making, is now viewed (as already \n\ndiscussed) as central to marketing and management (Ajay Menon and Anil Menon, 1976). \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\nHowever, business companies\u2019 goals still remain to be the increase of sales and value. \n\nAlthough they have at present a wider scope of targets to run to like \u201cgreen image\u201d, CSR, \n\nrespect for ecological balance and sustainable growth. \n\nHowever, some discussion and doubts about the causal relationship between sustainable \n\nstrategies and better corporate performance still arise (Menon and Menon, 1997, Dias \n\nSardinha and Reijnders, 2005). More recent research cast a whole renewed interest on the \n\nsubject. As worldwide companies like Dupont, 3M and Electrolux (early adopters of \n\nenvironmental criteria for strategic development) keep on track regarding environmental \n\nand sustainability issues, and grow more involved and committed, because they consider \n\nthat ecological and social responsibility is rewarding. \n\nAccording to several authors there is already robust enough evidence about social and \n\necological responsibility as performance drivers, responsible for cost reduction, higher \n\nvalue delivered to end-customers, shareholders and stakeholders in general (Auperle, \n\nCarrol and Hatfield ,1985; Pullman, Maloni and Carter, 2009). \n\nCompanies that adopt a marketing strategy for sustainable development and growth under \n\nthe new paradigm of social responsibility and ecological compatibility, have two high-\n\nlevel strategies for its development towards sustainability: (a) environmentally improved \n\nproducts and (b) environmental reinvented products, each one subdivided into two sets, \n\ndepending on the target end-market. (i) Penetration when the target is the same where \n\nproduct/company has already operated or (ii) development when product/company aims \n\nto enter new end-markets (or segments). It corresponds to environmental enhancement \n\nand constructs expansion of the classic Ansoff\u2019s product/market matrix23. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n23 Igor Ansoff, \u201cStrategies for diversification\u201d, Harvard Business Review, Sep./Oct. 1957, pg. 114. \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\nFigure 6.10 - Strategic matrix of environmentally \nenhanced and reinvented products \n\n \n\nSource: Adapted from Ansoff (1957) and Fuller (1999) \n\n \n\nStrategies for environmentally enhanced products  \n\nThe entry strategies and market development for environmentally improved products \n\nrequire minor changes or adjustments in products, production processes and distribution \n\nnetworks, in terms of compatibility with the ecosystem (new decision criterion of the \n\nmarketing-mix decision model for sustainable marketing). \n\nThose two strategies (1-market penetration/product enhancement and 2-market \n\ndevelopment) involve modest changes in products and processes that focus on improving \n\nthe performance of the product as it stands in PSLC. Based on the current used \n\ntechnology, the central features of the product and its benefits for the end-customer, \n\nshould remain essentially the same, but with an improved environmental performance, \n\nregarding production processes, distribution or terminal disposal (or perhaps returning to \n\nPSLC\u2019s waste/raw materials upstream). So this development strategy is based mainly on \n\nR2 actions with a short-term horizon. \n\n \n\nStrategies for environmentally reinvented products  \n\nIn contrast to the strategies of improved products, those relating to the environmentally \n\nreinvented product's column have their origin in reinventing the concept of a product with \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\nstronger compatibility with the environment, better distribution channels performance as \n\nproposed by the PSLC and the active contribution for the balance of ecosystems. \n\nIn terms of product development, these strategies involve a radical change in how \n\nproducts deliver value and benefits of their consumption to end-customers to \n\naccommodate their ecological attributes. These are strategies with a time horizon of \n\nmedium and long term, which inherently lead to exposure of the company to greater risks \n\nrelated to innovation. \n\n \n\n7 SUSTAINABLE MARKETING AUDIT \n\nDetailed analysis of the strategies available for management and sustainable marketing \n\ndecision enforcement are not part of this research project. As an exploratory research in a \n\ndiscipline as recent as sustainable marketing, it focuses instead in a practice sufficiently \n\ngrounded in theory and previous work, contributing to a more rapid introduction of this \n\nnew approach in the current management plans and marketing strategies, which may at \n\nonce incorporate the benefits of the new paradigm. \n\n \n\n7.1 Sustainability as a source of competitive advantage \n\nThe implementation of sustainable marketing in accordance with the new paradigm of \n\nsocial responsibility and environmental responsibility may in itself be a source of \n\ncompetitive advantage (sustainable) in the medium and long term (Banerjee, Bobby S., \n\nPeattie, Ken, 1999)24. \n\nThese advantages derive directly from the possibility of reducing costs through the \n\nimplementation of strategies P2 and R2 in the view of the PSLC. \n\n                                                 \n24\n\n In \u201cGreener Marketing: A global perspective on greening marketing practice.\u201d 1999. Edited by \nCharter, Martin and Polonsky, Michael J. Greenleaf Publishing Limited, Shefield, UK. \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n\nApart from these, the repositioning environment of company's products can lead to \n\nproduct differentiation and to conquer additional market shares (Earle, 1993). \n\nAccording to Porter (1991), reducing consumption of raw materials, the emergence of \n\ngrowing market segments for products with environmental features and compatible with \n\nthe environment and the new cleaner technologies, can be a source of competitive \n\nadvantage. \n\n \n\n7.2 Environmental product positioning assessment  \n\nBefore the establishment of any marketing plan development, one must make the \n\ndiagnosis of the starting point. That is, evaluate more thoroughly and accurately as \n\npossible where we are, thus one can define the objectives and goals to achieve and the \n\nway to go and the necessary investments to be made to support that strategy. \n\nThe aim of this research is to develop a sustainable marketing audit of a product-specific, \n\nin order to find the product\u2019s position regarding ecological burden. The comprehensive \n\ndiagnosis can become the starting point for the future strategic sustainable marketing \n\nplanning and implementing. \n\nAccording to Kotler and Keller (2005) the marketing audit is a comprehensive, \n\nsystematic, independent and periodic review of environmental objectives, strategies and \n\nmarketing activities of a company or business unit, to determine problems and \n\nopportunities and to recommend an action plan to improve the performance of marketing. \n\nThe sustainable marketing audit pursues the same objectives but in terms of \n\nenvironmental responsibility (compliance with the goals P2 and R2), improvement on the \n\nPSLC and integrated waste management, restricted to a specific product. The marketing \n\naudit focuses on sustainability, and so the characterization and evaluation (qualitative) of \n\nthe company's marketing strategies ecological impact for a product-specific (Fuller 1999). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n\nThe sustainable marketing audit is then subject to the following questions: \n\n \n\nTable 7.1 - Sustainable marketing audit questions \n\n\u2022 What are the waste streams associated with the product in the production process \n\nand distribution process? \n\n\u2022 What wastes are produced in the use / consumption of the product and at the end of \n\nits useful life? \n\n\u2022 What is the standard / typical method of deposition of the product? \n\n\u2022 Are there environmentally compatible processes, materials and raw materials or \n\nother improvements associated with the product that can be used in the current context \n\nof the production process and technology? \n\n\u2022 How to characterize the company's suppliers on the environmental responsibility? \n\nHow can you support providers to abandon the use of products/resources toxic or \n\nhazardous? \n\n\u2022 How do customers see the product, environmental friend or foe? \n\n \n\nWith this audit of sustainable marketing to a product-specific to be concretized in the \n\ndiagnosis of the current strategy of Delta Q, one is in possession of the basic product \n\npositioning against goals P2 and R2. \n\n \n\n7.3 Product positioning in relation to P2 and R2 \n\nAt the end of the sustainable marketing audit process, should be a diagnosis with a solid \n\nfoundation for developing and proposing a marketing strategy based on sustainable \n\nprinciples like pollution prevention (P2) and resource recovery (R2), and thus develop \n\ntruly sustainable actions to assure product\u2019s ecological impact reducing. \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\nThe comprehensive understanding of the product\u2019s standing point regarding sustainable \n\nmarketing goals is critical, not only to assess product\u2019s commitment to environmental \n\nsustainability and ecological responsibility, but moreover, to define the set of sustainable \n\nmarketing strategies available. \n\nDepending on product\u2019s positioning against P2 and R2 goals, a whole set of different \n\nsustainable marketing strategies arise, as presented in following figures, representing the \n\ndesirable product\u2019s perfect positioning and the path to be made to achieve the \n\nimprovement level goal: \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1 - P2 and R2 goals for product positioning \n\n \n\n \n\nIf a product is low positioned against P2, the marketing manager has to evaluate and \n\nlaunch actions under dematerialization or DFE range of strategies, as previously \n\ndiscussed, if suitable. Alternatively, if the product is already developed (or even being \n\nmarketed), product\u2019s marketing manager can start a deep re-evaluation of the product \n\naccording to the sustainable marketing proactive strategies discussed above. \n\nOn the other hand, if the product\u2019s positioning is low against R2 goals, the marketing \n\nmanager should evaluate a different range of available sustainable marketing strategies, \n\nlike the reuse of materials, material recycling, and above all, the integrated waste \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n\nmanagement, according to product\u2019s position in the PSLC (Product-system Life-cycle), as \n\nalready discussed above. \n\nThe design of the strategic marketing planning and implementation seeks to replicate the \n\necological systems in homeostasis. The company\u2019s production and marketing processes \n\nhave the unique property of providing the reproduction of those initiatives for a wide \n\nrange of stakeholders, or by a wide audience like suppliers, distribution channel partners \n\nor common public in general. We are, therefore, in a context of effective action at the \n\nlocal level, with potential impact at the global level, which can and must diminish whole \n\nindustry carbon footprint. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n8 DELTA CAF\u00c9S \n\nThe choice on Delta Caf\u00e9s was made mainly because it is the leading Portuguese \n\ncompany in coffee industry. This choice was also motivated by the company's decision to \n\nenter, consciously, the market segment of capsulated coffee, where the giant Nestl\u00e9 holds \n\nthe leadership. Delta Caf\u00e9s entered in this market segment with Delta Q brand, which is \n\nthe focus of the present research. \n\nDelta Q is essentially a pure marketing management product, born from the intrinsic \n\ndevelopment of day-to-day marketing management principles, in this case, the ones \n\nregarding to customer listening and needs satisfaction. In fact, soon after Nestl\u00e9 strong \n\nlaunch of Nespresso concept in the Portuguese market, Delta Caf\u00e9s started to receive \n\nincreasingly pressure demand from end-customers and professional customers asking why \n\nthere was no Delta Caf\u00e9s product in the market segment of capsulated coffee? \n\nThis demand pressure was made visible trough hundreds of e-mails and letters sent to the \n\ncompany and continuous questioning to the sales representatives by the professional \n\nmarket and distribution networks. In a very clever and bold move, Delta Caf\u00e9s \n\nmanagement found the right market opportunity and motivation to enter a new market \n\nsegment with a new product/brand and expanding company\u2019s revenue streams. \n\n \n\n8.1 Overview \n\nDELTA Caf\u00e9s is celebrating in 2011 its fiftieth anniversary and is one of the leading \n\nrepresentatives of the so-called Portuguese quality products and is also a special presence \n\nin the industry and in the business landscape, due to its brand recognition, value and trust \n\nfrom de end-market and its sustainable and organic growth. The coffee brand DELTA \n\nwas considered by the consumers a trusted brand for the last nine years. \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\nDELTA operates in the coffee industry under a vertical business integration approach. \n\nThe company acts on three main markets associated to coffee: \n\n2) DELTA sources green coffee directly on the producer markets and \n\nrespective farmers all over the world. \n\n3) DELTA imports green coffee for Portugal, being responsible for half of the \n\nPortuguese coffee imports, for plant processing and packaging. \n\n4) DELTA promotes, sells and distributes ready to consume coffee for several \n\nend-user and professional markets. More recently entered the niche of the \n\nencapsulated coffee rivaling directly with the giant NESPRESSO (Nestl\u00e9 \n\nGroup) and eventually could be added a new fourth dimension of vertical \n\nbusiness integration, regarding reverse logistics of coffee consumption \n\nwaste management, which will be furthermore detailed, later, once it is the \n\ncore of this case study. \n\n \n\nUndoubtedly, this is the result of the charisma of its founder in addition to a recognized \n\nproduct quality, which allows a single market share of 48% facing more than a two dozen \n\nother national and international competitors brands in the Portuguese market. Thus the \n\ncompany leads the Portuguese toasted coffee market. In Spain, the company achieved a \n\nmarket share of little over 5%, which assure the seventh place in the Spanish toasted \n\ncoffee ranking, just after three years of direct establishment in the market. \n\nThe profile consumption for coffee breaks into 72% for immediate consumption in \n\ncoffee-shops, restaurants and similar, and 23% for domestic consumption, according to \n\nlatest market reports cited by current CEO of the company Rui Miguel Nabeiro grand-son \n\nof the founder of DELTA Caf\u00e9s (Marketeer magazine, June 2009). \n\nCommendation holder Rui Nabeiro portraits a special entrepreneurship character and \n\npersonnel business vision that determined the launch of DELTA in a small village called \n\nCampo Maior on the Portuguese country side of Alentejo (beyond Tagus river), near the \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\nSpanish border, away from all the main end-markets, still today. Nevertheless, closer to \n\nthe green coffee import markets, and now, fifty years after, strategically positioned to \n\nlaunch its successful internationalization process, towards continental European markets. \n\nToday DELTA SGPS manages more than ten business companies in three continents, and \n\nalmost countless small other firms, ranging from store design, logistics and computing to \n\na professional training school and a children day care centre. \n\nThe company employs directly 1.746 persons according to 2009 DELTA's annual \n\naccounting report, that are responsible for a global gross wage mass of 50,8 million Euro. \n\nAlmost one third of all goods and subsidiary materials used for coffee processing, and \n\npackaging is domestic sourced, which accounts for annual internal buying over 83 million \n\nEuro. \n\nDELTA group is present directly in Portugal, Spain, France, Angola, Mozambique and \n\nBrazil, and keeps trading operations with more than thirty countries around the world, \n\nmaking DELTA, perhaps, one of the most globalised Portuguese companies. Following is \n\nshowed Delta inbound and outbound international flows from imports and exports \n\nrespectively: \n\nFigure 8.1 - DELTA international trading operations \n\n \nSource: Adapted from DELTA Annual accounting reports  \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\nIberian operations are structured around 34 own sales departments and 26 partner \n\ndistributor companies. This distribution network assures a coverage rate of 98% in \n\nPortugal and over 75% in Spain, and assures effective promotion and sales trough several \n\nend-markets like: Restaurants, Companies, Modern distribution (wholesalers and \n\nretailers), Vending machines, on-line and Brand-owned stores in Lisbon and Oporto. The \n\nfollowing figure shows Delta\u2019s Iberian marketing structure and geographical widespread \n\ntrough Portugal and Spain, as direct own marketing departments: \n\n \nFigure 8.2 - DELTA Iberian sales departments and distribution partners \n\n \nSource: Adapted from DELTA 2007 Sustainability Report \n\n \n\nTo assure all the necessary logistics regarding the producing, marketing and distribution \n\nthe company manages a fleet of 37 Lorries and 662 light vehicles. \n\nThe business model associated to the coffee industry as implemented by DELTA is \n\narranged under three main strategic building block operations: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\nFigure 8.3 - Traditional building blocks of business model \n\n \n\n \n\nGreen coffee inbound \n\nSince there aren't coffee planting and production in Portugal, all raw coffee must be \n\nimported, and the company bought from foreign producer markets in 2009, around 185,7 \n\nmillion euro of coffee (2009 DELTA's annual accounting report), which accounts for 50% \n\nof Portuguese coffee buying in the international markets. This means over exposure to the \n\nvolatility of exchange rates, financial markets and national economies performance and \n\nassessment by the market makers. \n\nFurthermore, it becomes of strategic importance due to the determinant impact on the \n\nfinal quality of the toasted coffee produced and marketed. From different production \n\nmarkets are obtained coffees with distinctive textures, aromas and (off course) tastes, \n\nwhich, through the first building block of the DELTA\u2019s business model, assumes seminal \n\nimportance to the final product quality and company market success. \n\nBased on these distinctive characteristics of green coffee from several continents and \n\nclimates, DELTA blends different aromas and textures to produce some of the best \n\nEspresso coffee in the world. \n\n \n\nGreen coffee processing \n\nIn this building block of the business model, green coffee goes trough three main \n\nprocessing stages and corresponds to the industrial step of the model. First the coffee \n\ngrains are toasted. Second they are subject to milling. In addition, in the third stage the \n\n\n\n \n\n78 \n\nseveral lots are mixed to create the different blends to pack and store for further \n\ndistribution.  \n\nPrior to the first stage of toasting, but quite close and critical, is the reception of the green \n\ncoffee, where is it immediately subject to sensorial inspection and characteristics \n\nallocation by origin, grain weight, dimensions and humidity.   \n\nThen grain samples are collected from the lots to further fine testing in the laboratory, \n\nwhich establishes, confirms and controls the lots origin and full characteristics, to \n\ndetermine exactly, the blend proportions needed to produce all the brands and lots \n\nmarketed by DELTA. \n\nFurthermore, at this stage sample toasting is performed to determine the levels of ashes \n\nproduced, loss of humidity, liquid extract produced, caffeine level and finally to assess the \n\ntaste of the finished coffee. \n\nAt the first stage, the grain coffee is toasted in three phases: \n\n1) Evaporation by heating is the longest phase; \n\n2) Drying the grains and aroma producing, as well as the brown colour that also \n\noccurs in this phase, is the most energy consumption phase reaching 1500 Celsius \n\ndegrees; \n\n3) Most important chemical transformation occurs, and humidity loss is maxim. \n\nAt the second stage coffee is milled. The milling process is also a critical one, once the \n\nmilling is too thick and water stays too long with the coffee, which produces a coffee with \n\nkind of a bitter taste. Adequate milling gives coffee the proper taste and creamy look. \n\nFinally, at the third stage, milled coffee is packed. DELTA processes two kinds of \n\npackaging: \n\n1) The vacuum pack, where all the air is sucked out of the pack, inhibiting the \n\noxidation of the coffee and hence the loss of aroma, taste and quality; \n\n\n\n \n\n79 \n\n2) The modified atmosphere, which consists in the injection of an inert gas in the \n\npack replacing oxygen to avoid, also, the coffee oxidation process. \n\n \n\nCoffee marketing and distribution \n\nThe strategic importance of this block derives from the extreme exposure the product \n\nacquires from this moment on. The finished packs of the different blend and presentations \n\nstart to be communicated and promoted trough the sales teams. Direct contact with \n\ncostumers enhances the sales, but is also a source of conflicts and the first input to after-\n\nsales process. \n\nThe stock keeping packs start to be distributed for the several widespread sales \n\ndepartments, wholesalers, professional channels and retail stores. \n\n \n\n8.2  Accounting and financial data \n\nFollowing is presented a quick overview of main figures of DELTA, intended to gain a \n\ncomprehensive picture of business evolution and dimension over the past seven financial \n\nyears. \n\nThe company has been facing a steady growth of business volume. Indeed DELTA \n\nevidences one of the best performances of recent years in Portuguese economic \n\nlandscape. Starting 2003 to 2009 business volume increased 66%, which corresponds to \n\nan amazing 11% annual average growth. Special note for 2007 where the company \n\nachieved almost 14,50% growth of business volume over 2006, as shown in the following \n\nfigure: \n\n\n\n \n\n80 \n\nFigure 8.4 - Evolution of business volume (Current prices) \n\n-  \n\n50,00 \n\n100,00 \n\n150,00 \n\n200,00 \n\n250,00 \n\n300,00 \n\n2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n\nM\nil\n\nli\no\n\nn\n E\n\nu\nro\n\nBusiness Volume\n\n \nSource: DELTA annual accounting reports \n\n \n\nAccompanying the business volume growth, also the workforce has been increasing.

These norms result from several \n\ninternational agreements like ILO \u2013 International Labour Organization, Human Rights \n\nUniversal Statement and United Nations Convention on Child Rights. \n\nThis is an enviable prize for any company, but for DELTA it is only the natural corollary \n\nfor a lifetime coherence of the founder of the company as a citizen and entrepreneur and \n\nas a CEO sharing and spreading it\u2019s vision and business philosophy over the community \n\nand all over the recruited human team. \n\nDuring one of the several interviews held with the responsible for DELTA Q project, \n\nwhen asked about the genesis of this strong feeling that the company transpires for all \n\naudiences regarding social responsibility and environment protection, after a lapse for \n\nthinking, the answer was unequivocal: \u201cCommendation holder Rui Nabeiro is the cradle \n\nof this way of carrying on our coffee business, in every aspect it involves.\u201d \n\nThe social responsibility certification obtained allowed DELTA to frame already on-\n\ngoing projects and was the framework which has launched some of the critical and \n\ninnovative projects in Portugal, regarding social responsibility and sustainability since \n\nthen. \n\nThe well-established values of the company were organized and since then \n\ncomprehensively communicated as follows: \n\n \nTable 8.1 - DELTA values statement \n\nIntegrity Transparency Loyalty Quality \n\nSustainability Solidarity Social responsibility Humility \n\n \n\n                                                 \n26 CEPAA \u2013 Council on Economics Priorities Accreditation Agency \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n\nAnchored on these values statement, the company defined and assumed as a main goal to \n\nachieve, according to 2003 DELTA Social Report, \u201cThe group objective is to assure \n\nbusiness profitability in a responsible manner with a strong and constant growth in such a \n\nway that the growing dynamics assures DELTA Excellency.\u201d \n\nTo pursue this main objective, the company recognised the necessity of commitment \n\nfacing five groups of stakeholders: \n\n \nTable 8.2 - DELTA stakeholders \n\n1) Shareholders \u2013 To protect and assure a fair return on investment of \n\nshareholders. \n\n2) Collaborators \u2013 to underline the importance of the employees for the good \n\ngovernance of the group; to assure proper work conditions, specially regarding \n\nhygiene and safety; to respect the employees' rights, specially the association \n\nand collective negotiation ones; to nurture the development of new ideas and \n\ntalents; to provide continuous training in order to make employees more \n\ncapable and active citizens; to assure without discrimination fair evolution \n\nopportunities; to promote the employee's commitment in company progress as \n\nwell as to the practicing of these principles. \n\n3) Clients \u2013 to create value for the client\u2019s business, to invest in R&amp;D  to offer \n\nproducts with enhanced added value as a strategy for acquisition and retention \n\nof customers and to anticipate the customer\u2019s needs in order to provide a better \n\nresponse. \n\n4) Trade Partners \u2013 to reinforce the ethical principles needed for keeping well and \n\nlong relationships with providers and all entities and organizations that \n\nsomehow relate to DELTA, based on transparency and continuous \n\nimprovement. \n\n5) Community \u2013 to drive business in a coherent and responsible manner to assure a \n\npro-active contribution to integrated community development and to nurture \n\nhuman, natural, financial, emotional and cultural resource sustainability. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n\nThe above-mentioned responsibilities are based on a comprehensive group of principles, \n\nwhich are boundaries for the development and driving of the DELTA business operations. \n\nThose principles are listed next: \n\n \n\nTable 8.3 - DELTA responsible guidance principles \n\n\u00bb Economic \n\n\u00bb Integrity and Transparency \n\n\u00bb Quality and Employees health and safety \n\n\u00bb Citizenship \n\n\u00bb Zero tolerance to child working \n\n\u00bb Free competition \n\n\u00bb Communication exemption. \n\n \n\nFollowing the social certification granted, DELTA framed and enhanced several \n\nimportant projects in different areas such as Citizenship and Sustainability. \n\nAs one of the most remarkable and important programs enhanced in the citizenship area, \n\nDELTA launched in early 2000, following the independence recognition of former East \n\nTimor, the campaign \u201cUm caf\u00e9 por Timor\u201d (One coffee for Timor) consisting in offering \n\n0,25 Euro for each 250 g pack of coffee produced at the factory in Campo Maior. The \n\nmoney collected this way was channeled mainly for infrastructures to support citizens in \n\nTimor like equipment and other school supplies. \n\nTrough implementation of the tools provided by the social certification, the company \n\ncould further systematize its deep social and environmental awareness. Thus the three \n\nstrategic building blocks could unfold in six: the three blocks from traditional business \n\norientation and three more came from the new social and environmental orientation, \n\nwhich might as well be called of sustainable marketing oriented. \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\nFigure 8.10 - New social and environmental business model building blocks \n\n \n\n \n\nThe three strategic building blocks added provide a comprehensive vision of the new \n\napproach resulting from the paradigm shift towards a sustainable and responsible growth \n\nof business companies, nation economies and the people. \n\n \n\nCommunity Involvement \n\nFrom this block was possible to build wide communication channels between the \n\ncompany and the communities surrounding DELTA in several contexts. End-customers \n\neasily obtain information and interact with the company trough user-friendly designed \n\nwebsites, green telephone number and DELTA Magazine. \n\nIt should be stressed the program \u201cDelta Planet\u201d with its own internet address27 where the \n\ncompany reunites all information about sustainability and the programs or special projects \n\nheld by the company. \n\n                                                 \n27\n\n http://www.planetadelta.pt, 12/09/2010 \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n\nA traceability program was also built to ensure product quality and effective after sales \n\nassistance regarding health and safety. \n\nIt, furthermore, should be underlined the R&amp;D efforts to develop and support HORECA28 \n\nbusiness in order to enhance the quality of equipments and services delivered to coffee \n\nconsumers, and to assure health and safety conditions for industry professionals. \n\n \n\nSustainability Management \n\nThis building block comprises two of the most significant actions taken by the company \n\ntowards an effective corporate responsibility and sustainability, namely \u201cThe Sustainable \n\nCoffee Origins Program\u201d and the effective impact in logistics and regional transportation, \n\nbridging at the same time local and national government, public railway company and \n\npositive impact on business and community. Each action comprehends the following \n\ndetailed scope: \n\n \n\n1) Sustainable Coffee Origins Program \u2013 Following prior program \u201cOne Coffee for \n\nTimor\u201d DELTA created one of the first private owned companies in Timor to \n\nstimulate coffee farmers for the need of standardization and certification of \n\norigin, branded \u201cCoffee Timor\u201d and to promote community sustainable \n\ndevelopment. \n\n Pursuant to this program ranging from the coffee plant farming, passing trough \n\nthe use of local and natural fertilizer until the improvement of green coffee, \n\nDELTA could  introduce in 2001 the first world selected blend from Timor \n\nOrigin Gourmet, branded as: TIMOR DIAK29.  \n\n                                                 \n28\n\n HORECA \u2013 Hotels, Restaurants and Cafeterias. \n29\n\n In T\u00e9tun (the autochthonous dialect) translates into: The good coffee from Timor. \n\n\n\n \n\n88 \n\n This was the standard coffee for the \n\ncreation of Timor Standard and for \n\nTimor Gourmet to achieve the \n\ninternational origin certification of \n\ncoffee from Timor. \n\n After the 2002 harvests, the \n\ninternational classification created by \n\nDELTA was accepted and widespread as Timor Standard. \n\n \n\n2) Bridging trough companies, government and community \u2013 DELTA was \n\ndecisive to motivate and bridge over several government departments, local \n\nauthorities and public railway company, among other business companies and \n\nentities, turn reality the creation of the container logistics platform in Elvas. \n\n These efforts come to avoid 205 kms several times a day by Lorries between the \n\nmaritime platform container in Alcantara-Lisbon and Campo Maior, where the \n\nDELTA plant is located, to deliver green coffee. Only the remaining part of the \n\nroute to Campo Maior is still assured by Lorries, in a distance of only 19 Kms. \n\n This project allowed a significant fuel saving with positive impact in the cost \n\nstructure of the company. Furthermore, it promoted job creation and cheaper \n\nlogistics for other local business companies and, moreover, reduced \n\ntremendously the carbon footprint of the inbound logistics of green coffee. \n\n \n\nTowards effective sustainability and to manage the ecological footprint from the group, \n\nDELTA implemented an environmental management system which comprehends: \n\nmonitoring of energy consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, water consumption \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n\n(both from public or own supplying), waste production from coffee processing and \n\npackaging (by toxicity and terminal disposal).   \n\n \n\nSocial responsibility \n\nThe last added strategic building block stands up for the full integration of the traditional \n\nbusiness model with the one resulting from the new marketing management approaches \n\nlike CSR and sustainable development. Thus the program created for the origin \n\ncertification: Timor Standard gave place to the development of similar programs in \n\nAngola, S. Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe and Brazil, and thus, contributing decisively for the \n\nenhancing of the coffee production (in quantity and quality) in a social and environmental \n\nmanner. \n\nThose programs are based in three \n\ncomplementary dimensions of \n\nintervention designated: Origins \n\nSustainability/Local Sustainability, Fair \n\nTrade and Eco-Efficiency. \n\nTogether with other international \n\nprograms and standards, life conditions of the farmers and local producing communities \n\nare improved as well as biodiversity and carbon sequestration. \n\nThese goals are to be achieved trough the widespread communication of the several \n\ninternational origin certifications which ensure the above goals and action principles. In \n\nthis condition are the following coffee international origin certifications: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n90 \n\nTable 8.4 \u2013 DELTA\u2019s coffee international certifications and standards \n\n\u00bb Organic \u2013 Biologic coffee produced under sustainable principles \n\nwithout fertilizers and independently audited and \n\ncertified. \n\n\u00bb Rainforest Alliance \u2013 aims to improve biodiversity by planting \n\nthe coffee plant in poor soils and manages the whole \n\npollutants from machine fuel to human effluents of \n\nthe community. This program also intervenes over \n\nthe population assuring quality food and drinking \n\nwater as well as the health services and medical aid. \n\n\u00bb Shadow Coffee \u2013 Is a coffee harvested from plants in the \n\nshadow of bigger trees, which allows a slow growth \n\nof the grain and produces a coffee with a high \n\nquality and strong scent. These kinds of coffee \n\nplants also provide shelter for birds and promote \n\nbiodiversity. \n\n \n\nAs a natural corollary for DELTA group, each company developed efforts towards \n\ncertification under several international norms and standards, beyond the ones directly \n\nrelated to coffee sourcing origins, blending and marketing. This way DELTA was the first \n\nPortuguese company to achieve Quality certification under ISO 9000 for the toasting \n\nindustry, back in 1994. Later it was also the first Portuguese company to be granted with \n\nquality product certification for the blends Delta Selec\u00e7\u00e3o, Delta Ouro and Delta Platina.  \n\nFollowing is presented a list of all certifications and group companies audited according \n\nto each norm requisites: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n\nTable 8.5 - DELTA international granted certifications \n\nNorm Granted Company Group Companies Audited \n\nSA 8000:2008  \nISO 22000:2005  \nNP EN ISO14001:2004 \nOHSAS 18001:2007 \n\nNovadelta SA \n\nMRAN Lda. \nDelta Caf\u00e9s \u2013 Madeira, SA \nTorrefac\u00e7\u00e3o Camelo, Lda. \nNovadelta \u2013 Espanha, SA \nSIEC, SL \nNovadelta \u2013 Fran\u00e7a, SARL \n\n \nEMAS \n \n\nNovadelta SA  \n\n \nNP ISO 9001:2008 \n \n\nNovadelta SA  \n\nHACCP Reg.852/2004  \n\nMRAN Lda. \nDelta Caf\u00e9s \u2013 Madeira, SA \nTorrefac\u00e7\u00e3o Camelo, Lda. \nNovadelta \u2013 Espanha, SA \nBel\u00edssimo Caf\u00e9s, Lda. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.4 Delta Q \n\nOn November 2007, DELTA enters the segment of capsulated coffee with its newly \n\ncreated brand Delta Q. This moment is one of the most important milestones of the \n\ncompany history for two reasons. First DELTA is not even a big Portuguese business \n\ncompany and could dare the giant Nestl\u00e9 in its very own game. And second, \n\ncommendation holder Rui Nabeiro shoots back \n\ntwenty years after Nestl\u00e9 tried to by his business to \n\nenter Portuguese coffee market trough the leading \n\nmarketing share company. \n\nCapsulated coffees are a niche of the general coffee market segment, specially associated \n\nwith domestic consumption, which represents about 27% of the total coffee consumption. \n\nNevertheless, entry to this niche requires not only to master all the competences to market \n\ncoffee in all the remaining traditional segments and channels, but also to assure the \n\n\n\n \n\n92 \n\navailability of a pressure machine with all associated details like sourcing the machine, \n\ncapsule compatibility assurance, distribution and sales channels, after-sales technical \n\nmaintenance, end-life machine disposal among many others. \n\nTo well manage the whole issues related to capsulated coffee was a real challenge to add \n\nto all the others that DELTA\u2019s management team had to deal with. \n\nCapsulated coffee history goes back as far as 1901 when \n\nMr. Luigi Bezzera invented and assembled the first \n\nEspresso Coffee Machine. According to the Bezzera\u2019s \n\nfactory website, the machine was publicly unveiled at the \n\nMilan International Fair in 1906, where Mr. Bezzera \n\npresented an absolute novelty: the first automatic espresso \n\ncoffee machine30. \n\nBack in 1970 Nestl\u00e9 correctly anticipated the further \n\ndevelopment of domestic coffee consumption and the trend for increasing demand on \n\nGourmet coffee, and decided to reinvent Mr. Bezzera\u2019s original concept and drastically \n\nmodernize and simplify the use of espresso machines along with dramatic size reducing to \n\nfit a wide range of users and situations. Due to this strategic decision, in 1986 \u201cNespresso \n\nSA, was set up in Vevey, Switzerland with a staff of five including one secretary. \n\nNespresso is launched in Switzerland and Italy with the C100 and C1100 machine models \n\nmanufactured by Turmix and targeted to the office coffee service sector. Capsule \n\nproduction begins in Orbe, Switzerland, and coffee varieties include Bolero, Capriccio, \n\nCosi and Decaffeinato.\u201d31 \n\n                                                 \n30 http://www.bezzera.it/home_ing.html, 20/02/2011 \n31 Nespresso Professional, Company History \n\nhttp://agents.nespresso-pro.com/en/about/history.html, 20-02-2011. \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n\nAccording to Nespresso website, the development of a \u201ctotally integrated system, after \n\nlong years of research and many patents, revolutionized the \n\nportioned coffee market and started a new era of encapsulated \n\ncoffee.\u201d Moreover, all those patents, many years later, made \n\nharder the task endeavoured by DELTA. Indeed, to be possible \n\nfor DELTA to enter this market, it would have to overcome \n\nseveral obstacles, of which Nespresso patents were not the lesser \n\none. \n\nNespresso entered the Portuguese market in 2003 with the machine model C100, and \n\nswiftly took advantage of almost two decades of international experience and on the \u00e9lan \n\naround Nespresso Club exclusive stores. \n\nIn turn, for DELTA entering this niche, although it was a marketing opportunity due to \n\nPortuguese coffee market maturity and approach to international mainstream behavior and \n\nneeds, it was also, and perhaps more determinant, a market pressure from Portuguese \n\ncustomers, who revealed an extreme trust and fidelity to brand and company. In fact, end-\n\nconsumers and professionals flood DELTA with letters, e-mails and even direct \n\napproaches to company professionals at several levels, demanding the chance to enjoy at \n\ntheir homes the delight of a high quality capsulated coffee, but from a Portuguese brand, \n\nespecially from DELTA. \n\n Delta Q entry level was the model M55 with a price of 149,90 Euro. The more \n\nsophisticated model Bugatti, for higher and demanding segments was priced at 499,90 \n\nEuro. There were launched seven blends of certified origin coffee like shown in the \n\nfollowing table: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\nTable 8.6 - Delta Q coffee blends and intensity \n\n  Intensity Blend \n\ndeQafeinatus \n\n \n\n1 \nAsian Robusta beans and South \nAmerican Arabica beans \n\ndeliQatus \n\n \n\n3 \nSelection of exotic flavours. \nLight, but with a keen flavour \n\nQonvivium \n\n \n\n4 \nSelection from the best coffee \ngrains from Tanzania, to Panama \nand Uganda \n\nQonvictus \n\n \n\n5 \nA touch of the Indies and a \nbalanced selection of aromas \nfrom Tanzania and Costa Rica \n\naQtivus \n\n \n\n8 \nSelection from Laos, Vietnam \nand El Salvador \n\nQharacter \n\n \n\n9 \nFine blend of flavours from Ivory \nCoast, Colombia and Brazil \n\nQalidus \n\n \n\n10 \n\nRich combination of Robusta \nbeans from the Cameroon and \nAngola, and Arabica beans from \nthe Honduras \n\n \n\nWith flavour intensity ranging from 1 (fewer intense aroma and taste) to 10 (the mostt \n\nintense aroma and taste), starting with a decaffeinate blend and finishing with a strong \n\ncoffee. \n\nThe end-user coffee price was 2,50 Euro for a carton with ten capsules for every blend \n\nwithout distinction. Current 2011 price is 2,90 Euro, which represents a price inflation (by \n\nthe end-customer) of 16% in the fourth year after launch. \n\nUntil January 2011, more than 10 million Delta Q capsules were sold. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n\nCapsule development \n\nTo overcome the Nespresso international patents regarding the aluminium coffee \n\ncapsules, there was the need to design a new capsule, assuring optimum coffee quality \n\nconservation, easy to use, compatible with available coffee machines technical \n\nrestrictions, and that should be recyclable. This was a major pre-requisite since the very \n\nbeginning of the project. Due to DELTA\u2019s social and environmental involvement, the \n\nability of both capsule and coffee should be susceptible to recycling and valorization after \n\nconsumption. This early preoccupation turned more recently into an autonomous project \n\nto be presented later in the research. \n\nThe design process for the DELTA Q capsule was assured with a full commitment of \n\nDELTA\u2019s technical and human resources with the involvement of a University \n\nLaboratory. \n\n \n\nMachine sourcing and development \n\nThe need to develop a brand new capsule for coffee with special characteristics like \n\nrecyclability, determined the need for a new coffee machine, regarding which materials \n\nthe capsules were made of, the water pressure and temperature necessary to assure coffee \n\nquality and properties in an everyday situation, among several other requisites. \n\nIn 2009 in collaboration with Diverge Design, DELTA launches the coffee machine \n\nQOSMO. The first capsulated coffee machine 100% projected and manufactured in \n\nPortugal. Once more, \n\nDELTA patents and takes \n\nadvantage of national know-\n\nhow and partnerships to \n\ninnovate and achieve \n\nmarketing differentiation and leverage. \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n\nThe new machine, besides the national design and modern looks, also unveiled a new \n\ntrend regarding urban young market segment of end-customers. The machine was \n\nspecifically designed to be compact and fully portable, incorporating multi-coffee \n\ndispensing function. \n\nUntil January 2011, were sold more then 220 thousand Delta Q coffee-machines. \n\n \n\nDistribution and promotion \n\nThe strategic marketing options of DELTA reflect its own approach to markets where it is \n\npresent, and clearly substantiate a differentiation strategy. While Nespresso supported \n\ntheir strategy on exclusiveness and selective distribution, privileging direct access to end-\n\ncustomers, DELTA opted for widespread and easy access of customers to the brand, \n\ntaking advantage of existing partnerships with modern distribution, hyper and \n\nsupermarkets, and some punctual agreements with specialized retailers. One can find in \n\nthis case the Media Markt chain of domestic electronics and appliances, and Spanish \n\nretailer El Corte Ingl\u00e9s. This last one also was extensive to Spanish market. \n\nOf course, promotion and communication strategies ought to be different due to enormous \n\ndisparity of reachable resources of each one of the companies. Nevertheless, DELTA took \n\nclever advantage of recognitions and trust levels that the brand evidence in Portuguese \n\nmarket, developed an advertising strategy based on one of the most recognised \n\nentertainers young talents in conjunction with the intensive use of the new technologies of \n\ncommunication like the internet and viral marketing. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n\n8.5 DELTA\u2019s Rethink-Eco-Project \n\nAccording to DELTA\u2019s press release of July 1st, 2010 on Rethink, \u201cthe project created by \n\nDelta Caf\u00e9s aims to close the cycle of coffee. Is an integrated research project of waste \n\nrecovery produced by the company's activity and the coffee consumption. This is a unique \n\nproject in Portugal to be integrated and analyzed. Given the power of the entire coffee \n\ncycle, including the consumer and the waste generated, it is an enormous value source.\u201d \n\nThe project breaks into four integrated tasks to \n\naccomplish the main goal of adding economic \n\nvalue to coffee grounds and used capsules from \n\nDelta Q consumption. \n\nThe four main tasks of Delta Rethink project are: \n\n \n\n1) First task consists of comprehensive logistics network of distribution \n\nassessment, in order to develop a cost effective reverse logistics system, to \n\nrecover coffee grounds and polyethylene capsules back to industrial facilities. \n\nThus it is possible to add value to the otherwise waste and to re-launch it into a \n\nnew economic cycle of production. \n\n2) Second task relates to Delta Q coffee \n\ncapsule (containing dreg) collection in \n\nDelta Q\u2019s specific designed containers, \n\nnamed Capsul\u00f5es, in selected locations like \n\nDelta Q own stores, partner h\u00edper and \n\nsupermarkets and large professional end-\n\ncustomers like offices, plants and \n\nwarehouses. \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n\n3) Third task is the life cycle assessment (LCA) of Delta Q coffee machines, in \n\norder to assess the environmental impact. At the same time, it will be identified \n\nthe material components and processes which allow further development and \n\nproduction of more environment-friendly coffee machines and accessories. It, \n\nfurthermore, will be assessed the technical and economic viability of \n\nreintegration Delta Q coffee capsules and machines waste into fabrication of \n\nnew Delta Q equipments and accessories. \n\n4) Fourth task focus on R&amp;D processes to add value to dreg. \n\n \n\nDELTA is developing this project with third party partners. Regarding the container \n\ncollection for used coffee capsule's design, it counts with the services of a most young and \n\ninnovative design company \u2013 Diverge Design (http://www.divergedesign.com). \n\nOn R&amp;D resources and facilities, DELTA relies on UNIDEMI \u2013 R&amp;D Unit in \n\nMechanical and Industrial Engineering from Universidade Nova de Lisboa \n\n(http://unidemi.fct.unl.pt/). For the dreg recovery research, DELTA counts with the \n\ncollaboration of IBET \u2013 Technologic Experimental Biology Institute \n\n(http://unidemi.fct.unl.pt/), the largest biotechnology research organization in Portugal. \n\nDelta Rethink Eco-Project is funded by DELTA group and by public funds from QREN32 \n\n, which contributes with a grant of 2 million Euro. Company own financial resources for \n\nthe project were not disclosed. \n\nThe project aims to collect in the first twelve months more than two hundred tonnes of \n\ncoffee grounds. Later, with the increase of end-customer environmental awareness and \n\nthe multiplication of used capsule collection points, it sure will be possible to grow \n\nsubstantially this figure. \n                                                 \n32\n\n National Strategic Reference Framework - http://www.qren.pt, 20/01/2011 \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n\nAfter six months project, DELTA collected 477.000 used coffee capsules and added value \n\nto more than twelve tonnes of coffee grounds. \n\nAs main results of this, under all aspects an innovative project, DELTA aspires to know \n\nand to devise alternative ways to extract more value from dreg and its wide utilization \n\noptions. They vary from cosmetic industry, nutrition and energy to biological farming. \n\nBeyond the self-evidence of the critical importance of this project, must be underlined the \n\nabsolute innovative approach and scope. \n\nIf one takes into account \n\nthat Nespresso recycling \n\nproject is focused mainly \n\non the recovery and \n\nfurther utilization of the \n\naluminium capsule33 (as \n\nfar as it is public from \n\nNespresso website and \n\ntraditional media communication coverage). \n\nRethink-Eco-Project project manifests a complete and new breath landscape for dreg \n\nreutilization and to extract more economic value from it. It should be taken into account \n\nthat DELTA as a leader of the Portuguese coffee market produces annually over 20 \n\nthousand tones of coffee, which corresponds roughly to 40 thousand tones of wet dregs. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n33\n\n http://www.ecolaboration.com/#/aaa/pt/capsules/recycling/Portugal, 21/02/2011 \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n\n9 DELTA Q SUSTAINABLE MARKETING AUDIT \n\nIn the next chapters will be developed and presented the actual sustainable marketing \n\naudit to Delta Q. The audit starts by scope\u2019s definition and a brief review of the targets to \n\nmeet against sustainable marketing basic goals P2 (pollution prevention) and R2 (resource \n\nrecovery).  \n\nThen the research finds the answers for the questions gathered trough the marketing audit \n\nchecklists, where are covered the following main questions: company overall assessment, \n\nproduct assessment, distribution channels assessment, promotion and communication \n\nassessment, pricing assessment and target markets (or market segments) assessment. \n\n \n\n9.1 Sustainable marketing audit scope \n\nSustainable marketing audit to Delta Q aims to achieve a comprehensive full detailed \n\nproduct profile, regarding its market characteristics and performance, in relation with its \n\nenvironmental footprint.  \n\nIn other terms, it is desired to understand the position of the product in the PSLC and \n\nidentify its sustainability performance, waste generation by production processes and by \n\nconsumption. The marketing diagnostic will enable DELTA to understand its strategic \n\ncurrent position regarding P2 and R2 goals framed by strategic environmental matrix. \n\nIt thus becomes possible to draw a comprehensive sustainable marketing plan for Delta Q \n\nunder a double perspective: to drive sales growth and profitability by its own efforts and \n\ndo so in an ecological and social manner, ensuring resource use reduction and preventing \n\npollution trough waste management and recycling. \n\nTo accomplish the marketing diagnostic, and since this is essentially a qualitative \n\nresearch, will be followed roughly the marketing-mix approach and will review in detail: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n\n1) Product environmental impacts, waste generation by production processes, \n\ndistribution and consumption; \n\n2) Pricing process and components, in particular, environmental or/and social cost \n\ninternalization, profit margin available to foster consumer behaviour change; \n\n3) Distribution restraints and requisites for waste generation, energy efficiency, \n\nenvironmental and social issues and channel communication; \n\n4) Green communication assessment for environmental and social issues associated \n\nwith product consumption, like alternative uses, waste generation and terminal \n\ndisposal. \n\n \n\nSometimes DELTA Caf\u00e9s data is provided for understanding the landscape where \n\nDELTA Q was born and is daily managed. Other times, because there is no product-\n\nspecific (Delta Q) available data on the subject, like Delta Q\u2019s specific waste generation \n\nwhile in industrial processing, or diesel consumption for distribution. \n\nOn another hand, sometimes when researching a specific issue or process, the analysis \n\nends on studying and assessing the company, rather than the product-specific Delta Q. \n\nThis can occur due to the nature of the process involved, or because it is impossible to \n\nisolate clearly the Delta Q\u2019s own process. This happens because Delta Q is one coffee \n\nproduct among many others from the company portfolio, including even tea. \n\nNevertheless, and despite difficulties, every question was answered as close as the \n\nresearch demand and the data available has allowed. \n\nFinancial and environmental data is provided in order to understand the overall present \n\ncontext of the company and product-specific, as a basis to define the window of strategic \n\nopportunities available, not under a theoretical standpoint, but rather feasible and at \n\nDELTA\u2019s marketers reach. \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n\nSince present research is a qualitative study, special emphasis is cast on significant \n\ninformation in order to understand origins and constructs behind implemented strategies, \n\nand to devise probable consequences on the medium and long run for the brand. \n\n \n\n9.2 Environmental company culture \n\n9.2.1 Company environmental statement \n\nThe company has an environmental commitment since 2002, when was granted with \n\nsocial responsibility certification by Norm SA 8000 from CEPAA \u2013 Council on \n\nEconomics Priorities Accreditation Agency. It thus has also been committed to \n\nenvironment and sustainability and have incorporated that same commitment at the \n\nhighest level of strategic guidance, which are the company\u2019s very own VALUES \n\nSTATEMENT as follows: \u201cIntegrity; Transparency; Loyalty; Quality; Sustainability; \n\nSolidarity; Social responsibility; Humility.\u201d \n\nEnvironment also occupies an important position at the business principles to respect by \n\nDELTA management and employees: \u201cParticipative governance; Sustainable business; \n\nsocial and Environmental responsibility.\u201d Moreover, the company took its environmental \n\ncommitment really serious, and reorganized itself in order to accommodate new values, \n\nand guiding principles. To do so was created an environment management system with \n\nthe following organic: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n\nFigure 9.1- DELTA\u2019s environmental management system \n\n \n\n \n\nThis system, directly depending of the board counts, with a full time manager for \n\nsustainability that supervises every project that deals any in way with environmental \n\nissues. The system meets every forth day, and eventually as needed. \n\nTo monitor the ecological impact of industrial and marketing processes, although there is \n\na widespread academicals and business uncertainties on how to define and agree on the \n\nright indicators to measure sustainability34, DELTA selected an array of indicators to \n\ntrack, resumed as follows: \n\n \n\nTable 9.1 - DELTA\u2019s environmental indicators \n\nEnergy Profile \n\nTracks on the type of energy \n\nconsumption split by natural gas, \n\ngasoline, diesel and electricity. \n\nTOE35 energy consumption \n\nTonnes of Oil Equivalent (TOE) \u2013 \n\nMeasures energetic consumption \n\ncompared with oil energy equivalent \n\n                                                 \n34 Simon Bell and Stephen Morse, \u201cSustainability Indicators \u2013 Measuring the immeasurable?\u201d, Second \n\nEdition 2008, Earthscan, London, UK. \n35 TOE \u2013 Tonnes of Oil Equivalent.

DELTA has a rather \n\nequitable distribution of energy sources. It consumes a minimal quota of gasoline and the \n\nremaining sources' weight about one third each of total energy consumption, like is shown \n\nin the company's energy consumption profile figure: \n\n                                                 \n36 Portuguese Environmental Agency, http://www.apambiente,pt \n\n\n\n \n\n105 \n\n \nFigure 9.2 - Energy consumption profile \n\nDiesel; 35% Diesel; 31%\n\nNatural Gas; \n\n29%\nNatural Gas; \n\n32%\n\nElectricity; \n\n35%\n\nElectricity; \n\n36%\n\nGasoline; 1%Gasoline; 1%\n0%\n\n10%\n\n20%\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\n50%\n\n60%\n\n70%\n\n80%\n\n90%\n\n100%\n\n2007 2009\n\n \nSource: Delta 22007 and 2009 Sustainability report \n\n \n\nSpecial emphasis should be cast on efforts to swap certain heat production energy sources \n\nfrom diesel to natural gas, which has more heating produce efficiency and burns in a \n\ncleaner manner, i.e. emits less CO2. \n\nThe company has been implementing more cost-effective processes in order to achieve \n\nbetter environmental performance. Analysing total energy consumption, measured in \n\nTOE (Tonnes of Oil Equivalent), DELTA is reducing its energy consumption even with \n\ncoffee production growth, like shown in the following energy consumption evolution \n\ngraphic: \n\n \nFigure 9.3 \u2013 TOE energy consumption \n\n0\n\n1.000\n\n2.000\n\n3.000\n\n4.000\n\n5.000\n\n6.000\n\n7.000\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\nT\nO\n\nE\n -\n\n T\no\nn\ne\ns\n O\n\nil\n E\n\nq\nu\niv\n\na\nle\n\nn\nt\n\n \nSource: Delta 22007 and 2009 Sustainability report \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n106 \n\nAs shown in graphic bellow, total energy consumption by total coffee sales has been \n\ndecreasing and patents a 10% reduction from 2007 to 2009: \n\n \n\nFigure 9.4 - TOE by Tons of coffee sold \n\n0,19\n\n0,2\n\n0,21\n\n0,22\n\n0,23\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\nT\nO\n\nE\n/C\n\no\nff\ne\n\ne\n T\n\no\nn\n\n \nSource: Delta 2007 and 2009 Sustainability report \n\n \n\nDelta is also committed to reduce its carbon footprint by actively manage CO2 emissions. \n\nFollowing graphic shows a 200 tonnes reduction on carbon dioxide emissions, from 2007 \n\nto 2009: \n\n \n\nFigure 9.5 \u2013 CO2 total emissions \n\n11.750\n\n11.800\n\n11.850\n\n11.900\n\n11.950\n\n12.000\n\n12.050\n\n12.100\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\nC\nO\n\n2\n T\n\no\nn\n\n \n\nSource: Delta 2007 and 2009 Sustainability report \n\n \n\nSame trend is confirmed when one takes into account carbon dioxide emissions by tonnes \n\nof coffee sales, which show a drop from 0,55 Tonnes of CO2 emissions to 0,54 Tonnes of \n\nCO2 between 2007 and 2009 while sales evidenced important increase, as shown in the \n\nfollowing graphic: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n\nFigure 9.6 - CO2 emissions by Tons of coffee sold \n\n0,52\n\n0,53\n\n0,53\n\n0,54\n\n0,54\n\n0,55\n\n0,55\n\n0,56\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\nC\nO\n\n2\n/C\n\no\nff\n\ne\ne\nT\n\no\nn\n\n \n\nSource: Delta 2007 and 2009 Sustainability report \n\n \nRegarding Delta Q's packing waste production, DELTA faces an adverse and low-eco-\n\nresponsibility awareness from suppliers and distribution channels. All packing systems \n\nare built to fulfil transport and delivery requirements, both from inbound and outbound \n\nlogistics. Beginning with green coffee imports until hyper and supermarkets distribution \n\nchains, becomes boldly evident the disregard for re-usable transport and distribution \n\npacking\u2019s, which would allow less packing waste producing and reduced distribution \n\noperation costs as will be detailed further on the present report. At the same pace as the \n\nsales growth, packing material and waste generation also have grown as evidenced in \n\nfollowing graphic: \n\n \n\nFigure 9.7 - Packing waste production \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n2006 2007 2008 2009\n\nT\no\nn\n\nCoffee Bags Composite Packs Plastic Packs Paper/Carton Others\n\n \n\nSource: Delta 2007 and 2009 Sustainability report \n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n\n \n\nDELTA pursues a coherent conduct with its mission and values statement and in \n\naccordance with social certification granted. Thus from all waste and rubbish generated \n\nby coffee business, the way the company faces its commitments translates in a permanent \n\neffort to enforce 3 R\u2019s37 environmental management principles, and that is evident by the \n\namount of annually value added waste. As well as the amount of terminal disposal waste, \n\nwithout further valorization reduced almost 23% from 2007 to 2009, as evidenced in the \n\ngraphic bellow: \n\n \n\nFigure 9.8 - Waste production treatment \n\nValue \n\nAddedd; \n\n80%\n\nValue \n\nAddedd; \n\n83%\n\nValue \n\nAddedd; \n\n78%\n\nTerminal \n\nDisposal; \n\n17%\n\nTerminal \n\nDisposal; \n\n20%\n\nTerminal \n\nDisposal; \n\n22%\n\n0%\n\n10%\n\n20%\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\n50%\n\n60%\n\n70%\n\n80%\n\n90%\n\n100%\n\n2007 2008 2009\n\n \n\nSource: Delta 2007 and 2009 Sustainability report \n\n \n\n9.2.2 Social and environmental reporting \n\nSince DELTA was first granted with Social Responsibility Certification, it issues a \n\nSustainability Report every two years. It should be noted that Portuguese state, so far, has \n\nnot made mandatory any kind of social or environmental accounting or reporting, thus \n\nevery move from DELTA towards social and environment responsibility, sustainable \n\ndevelopment and ecological stewardship, has been an act of will. \n\n                                                 \n37\n\n 3 R\u2019s stand for Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n\nAlthough Portuguese government had approved The National Strategy for Sustainable \n\nDevelopment\n38, and the respective plan of implementation under the form of law (also \n\napproved by the parliament), the effective result hadn't overcome the creation of \n\ncommissions and group discussions. Which has supported and promoted several good \n\nideas and odd projects, without any real impact on transporting for practice the \n\nimperatives of the new sustainability paradigm. Thus failing to help business companies \n\nto contribute and effectively participate in the change that humanity demands. \n\nThe company sustainability report usually presents the following structure, which roughly \n\nfollows the six strategic building blocks detailed above (see Figure 8.10): \n\n \n\nTable 9.2 - Delta sustainability report structure \n\n1.

Social responsibility \u2013 This chapter divides into five parts. The first part of \n\nthe chapter covers the person\u2019s management principles, equality policy, \n\nemployee\u2019s perks and benefits, health and safety, agreements and \n\ncollective bargaining, employee's performance assessment model and \n\ntraining programmes. The second part reports on DELTA's specific \n\nenvironmental program \u2013 DELTA PLANET. The third part covers all \n\ninitiatives, programs and partnerships related to community, like DELTA \n\ncommunity support, associations funded by the company, child and family \n\nsupport, educational centres and volunteer programs among others. The \n\nfourth part is dedicated to R&amp;D and innovation. And the fifth part is \n\nrelative to partners and partnerships promoted or supported by DELTA \n\ngroup. \n\n \n\n9.2.3 Company current environmental and social programs \n\nDELTA is a paradigmatic case of social responsibility from the top to bottom level of the \n\ngroup. Starting with the early awareness of its charismatic founder until full commitment \n\nof management and integral support from employees is the only rational manner to justify \n\nthe involvement of the company in so many projects, beyond every difficulty and \n\nobstacles within day-to-day business. \n\nPresently, the company is involved in the following projects and programs: \n\n \n\nTable 9.3 - Delta current social and environmental projects \n\nSocial Responsibility Environment and Sustainability \n\n\u00bb Heart DELTA association \u2013 Solidarity \nassociation to promote volunteer and \n\nsocial support programs. \n\n\u00bb Educative centre Alice Nabeiro \u2013 child \n\n\u00bb Eco-Schools \u2013 International program to \nraise in children and young the \n\nawareness for environmental issues and \n\nresponsibility \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n\nintegrated training centre to bridge \n\nscience, culture, technology in order do \n\ndevelop better citizenship. \n\n\u00bb Entrepreneurship manual \u2013 Ideas to \nshape the world.

Which in \n\naddition with already known characteristics from end-customers, like the trust the brand \n\nDELTA enjoys, level of distribution coverage and market share, was a determinant in \n\nfavour of the project study, planning and implementation under certain initial pre-\n\nrequisites like the recyclability of the capsule, among others. \n\nHence, no special market study was developed in order to determine significant product \n\nbenefits or distinctive features to take advantage on. It was kind of a piggy-back strategy, \n\nonce competition had already established product concept (regarding coffee capsules and \n\nproprietary coffee machines need). \n\nOnce again, echoes the idea of misusing the opportunity to build a sound and full-\n\nsuccessfully product marketing strategy. Indeed Delta Q marketers would have a lot to \n\ngain in robust planning and effective budgeting if they could consider critical end-\n\ncustomers insights regarding: \n\n1) Target market segments and their demographic and psychographic \n\ncharacterization; \n\n2) End-customers decision making models and buying behaviour; \n\n3) End-customers system-beliefs about green products, waste generation (by \n\nproducing and consuming the goods), reusability or/and recyclability; \n\n4) Target-markets environmental perception about product category; \n\n5) Target-markets perception about company \u201cgreenness\u201d or ecological and social \n\ncommitment; \n\n6) Present and future green market-segments relevance for the company\u2019s strategy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n\n9.4 Delta Q Sustainability assessment \n\n9.4.1 Waste generation by product processes \n\nDelta Q production process does not stand for any particular issue concerning pollution or \n\nwaste generation in addition to the ones resulting from coffee processing in general. \n\nDelta Q capsules are made of inert polymer39 and are produced on the plant site with \n\nresidual waste generation that is easily reintroduced into the productive process of new \n\ncapsules. However green coffee processing deals with some environmental issues, like: \n\nresidual ashes from toasting process, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and liquid effluents \n\nfrom grain washing and human related. \n\nRegarding liquid effluents production it should be noted that they are totally processed at \n\nthe wastewater treatment station and 67% (2007) of them were reused in irrigation, the \n\nremaining part joins the public sewer system. \n\nOnly one percent of total waste generation by coffee processing was toxic. From a global \n\namount of 1.119 tons, in 2007, by 2009 was achieved one important goal: toxic waste was \n\nreduced to zero. \n\nFrom DELTA's total waste production, only 17% face terminal disposal, the remaining \n\npart is further valued or recycled. \n\nThe most bulky waste the company has to deal with is related to inbound logistics and \n\npackaging. DELTA stresses the efforts to reuse (as possible) green coffee bags40. \n\nPackaging also poses important waste generation issues that have been limiting some \n\nenvironmental goals' achievement. The boundaries regarding outbound logistics and \n\npackaging are the direct results of the marketing channels pressures and end-customers \n\ndemands. While retailers press for easy and more cost-effective (meaning small) stock \n\n                                                 \n39 Polymer is a substance which has a molecular structure built up chiefly or completely from a large \n\nnumber of similar units bonded together, e.g. many synthetic organic materials used as plastics and \nresins (Oxford Dictionaries Online, http://oxforddictionaries.com, 22/02/2011). \n\n40 Bulk green coffee is traded in international standard 60 Kg bags. \n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n\nkeeping units and selling units. Consumers demand easiness to use with attractiveness, \n\ndisregarding many times the environmental pressure from a small 20 cm carton box41. \n\n \n\n9.4.2 Design, use, composition and terminal disposal of the product \n\nDelta Q is a product-specific design to a target market segment, but due to its very nature \n\n(coffee) there is no other alternative use. So, there are some critical aspects related to its \n\nconsumption tied with proprietary coffee machine. Even if the produced coffee-machines \n\nare much lesser than the thousands of coffee tons consumed every year. \n\nCoffee-machines are still a problem when arriving at its life cycle ending, regarding \n\nrecycling and terminal disposal. This problem is being already addressed by DELTA, not \n\nonly through the collection campaign for used equipments, but also trough one of the \n\ntasks committed to Rethink-Eco-project program, which aims to define new recycling and \n\nre-use standards, as well as the integration of recycled materials into its production. \n\nCapsules also pose important issues regarding recycling and terminal disposal of the \n\npolymer and the dreg. Taken apart each material is relatively easy to recycle and reuse. \n\nPolymer can be reused in the production of other lesser quality \u201cplastics\u201d after milling, \n\nand the dreg can directly be used with significant value and quality as a fertilizer. \n\nHowever, taken together they pose a critical problem: material separation. And take into \n\naccount that the capsule contains also a paper filter film and an aluminium film for \n\nsealing. \n\nTo deal with those issues DELTA launched the project Rethink Eco-project detailed \n\nearlier (see chapter 8.5 \u2013 DELTA\u2019s Rethink-Eco-Project). \n\n                                                 \n41 A regular toothpaste carton box consumes the wood equivalent to 2 or 3 branches from an adult pine \n\ntree (estimated on estimates from Boise Cascade, Idaho, USA, \nhttp://ecology.com/features/paperchase, 22/02/2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n\nRegarding the capsule, since the beginning of the project Delta Q, the company has posed \n\nits recyclability as one of the main projects requisites, which are assured since launching \n\nof the brand. The same occurs for separation process of capsule and dreg. The challenge \n\nthat Rethink-Eco-project also addresses is to reduce the cost of this separation. However, \n\nprior to face the problems of material separation, it must be figured out how to motivate \n\nend-customers to pro-active initiate the recycling chain by depositing used-capsule in the \n\nspecial collector placed by DELTA, rather than throw them for the domestic rubbish \n\nbasket. \n\nThe other issue that Rethink-Eco-Project also deals with is adding value to the coffee \n\ngrounds. Although there are plenty of alternative uses for dreg, its adding value under the \n\nlight of sustainable marketing boundaries and waste management principles, is only \n\npossible if economically viable. \n\n \n\n9.4.3 Alternative roles of the product regarding recycling, re-utilization \nand materials transformation \n\nDue to its own nature, once coffee is food and that is all the need it satisfies, there is no \n\ndevisable alternative role for this product. \n\nRegarding the capsule, there is (so far) no viable field for reuse beyond creative domestic \n\napplications for leisure. \n\nFor the coffee grounds, it is possible the direct re-utilization as plant fertilizer, which is \n\ncommon in many suburban areas. However, the same does not apply for capsulated \n\ncoffee, which demands some industrial approach, due to small quantity of dregs for each \n\nused capsule. \n\nRegarding the exclusive coffee-machine associated to Delta Q, they are to be selectively \n\ncollected at the end of its life cycle for proper terminal disposition after disassembling and \n\nretrieving toxic and non-degradable components.  \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n\n \n\n9.4.4 Main product benefit to end-user changing or enhancement \n\nFor the same reasons stated above, there is presently no alternative use for capsulated \n\ncoffee. There is, however, some enhanced alternative use for the machine coffee \n\nproprietary of Delta Q, considering some design modifications. Taking into account that a \n\ngood domestic Delta Q coffee demands water at about 900 Celsius degrees, it could be \n\nconsidered the viability of enhancing alternative uses for the coffee machine, like heating \n\n(or boiling) small water portions, since the physics behind are the same. \n\n \n\n9.4.5 Reducing/eliminating waste generation (solid or liquid) and toxic \nemissions from the production process \n\nIn 2009 DELTA has achieved the goal of zero toxic solid waste generation. This is \n\nremarkable in face of the absence of legally imposed limits for toasting coffee industry \n\nemissions. \n\nOf course, there is always room for improvement. Moreover, considering the technical \n\nand scientific development pace, it is very likely that new technology and processes arise \n\nto pollute less, to consume less energy, or just to make the industrial processing of green \n\ncoffee more cost effective, which will result in a shorter ecological footprint. \n\nDepending on investment costs, there is some viable opportunity to incorporate more \n\nrecycled water into the productive process. Once only a part of the treated water from \n\nwater treatment station is reused for irrigation, it is possible, trough a simple decanting \n\nprocess, to enhance treated wastewater quality, not for human drinking but for washing \n\noperations and WC flushes. \n\nRegarding plant illumination, there is also a new array of cost-effective solar-related \n\nsolutions, in order to bring sun light inside constructions recurring to aluminium mirrors \n\nthat concentrate the sun light. \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n\nFurthermore, a new generation of photovoltaic solar panels is emerging, with longer \n\nproductive life, more efficient cells, and above all, cheaper prices. Other opportunities \n\nmay arise from technical development on the way, and are worthwhile to be close \n\nmonitored, like more efficient carbon sequestration filters for chimneys or more energy \n\neffective toasting ovens and mills. \n\n \n\n9.4.6 Waste produced by packaging at different stages of inbound, \nproduction and marketing processes \n\nTo DELTA, packaging is one of the most critical cost drivers and waste production \n\nsource. Starting with the reception of the green coffee and the 60 Kgs bags, where coffee \n\ngrains are carried, and finishing with the packaging necessary for stock keeping, \n\ndistribution and selling units to end-customer, there is an enormous amount of paper and \n\ncarton, aluminium film and plastic film, and even wood. \n\nInbound logistics produce essentially rubbish bags from the reception of green coffee. \n\nProcessing (toasting and milling) produces an array of subsidiary input packages for \n\ncoffee processing like cans (plastic and metal) and a multitude of rubbish from carton \n\nboxes to plastic bags of varied dimensions. \n\nAt the end, with the finishing of the Delta Q capsules it is necessary to pack them in \n\ndifferent 10 capsules carton boxes (selling unit) for each blend. It is then necessary to \n\npack 50 boxes of 10 capsules from the same blend in a larger box (distribution unit). It is \n\nthen necessary to put together 40 of these boxes to assemble one pallet (transport unit) of \n\nthe same blend. Finally, the pallet is coiled with retractile plastic and is ready for \n\ndistribution both for DELTA sales departments and distribution chains central \n\nwarehouses. \n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n\nGiven the packaging classification from Ponto Verde, three levels42 of packaging were \n\napplied: 1st level (or primary) packing corresponds to the selling unit, 2nd level (or \n\ngrouped) packing is the distribution unit and 3rd level packing is the transport unit. \n\nAll of them are subjected to annual contribution for Ponto Verde, regarding the type of \n\npacking material and quantity and weight of packing launched into the distribution \n\nchannels and consumer markets. Hence any intervention in the logistic operations, \n\nchanging transport or distribution or unit-selling packing, can play an important role, \n\neither by cost reduction, or fewer packing materials injected into market and distribution \n\nnetworks, thus lesser mandatory contributions for Ponto Verde. \n\n \n\n9.4.7 Reengineering of packing levels  \n\nTaking present the three packing levels described above, it looks very unlikely to the \n\ncompany to intervene deep at 3rd level (transport or distribution unit) due to two kinds of \n\nreasons:  \n\n1) Shelf replacement and warehousing requisites from main distribution chains of \n\nhyper and supermarkets; \n\n2) Transport and handling of 3rd level packs, once they are built around international \n\nstandard pallets (euro pallet43) and are fully suited for lorry transport and \n\nmechanic stacker handling. \n\nHowever, there are some opportunities for 1st level (selling unit) and 2nd level packing \n\n(grouped pack). It is very likely (with a little help from marketing communication \n\nspecialists) to swap the traditional carton box with 10 capsules for biodegradable plastic \n\npacking (1st level packing or selling unit). Of course this change should take into account: \n\n                                                 \n42\n Sociedade Ponto Verde website: http://www.pontoverde.pt/empresas/embalagens, 15-07-2010. \n\n43 Euro Pallet \u2013 80 cm X 120 cm standard pallet is the most common merchandise handling pallet in \nEurope. EPAL - European Pallet Association, \n\n http://www.epal-pallets.de/uk/ueber_uns/kurzportrait.php, 24-02-2011. \n\n\n\n \n\n120 \n\n1) The investment costs and payback  period for the plastic packaging machine; \n\n2) The \u201csuper attractive\u201d design and carefully choice of the pack colours scheme; \n\n3) Effective communication campaign to present the new packing not only as \u201cnew\u201d, \n\nbut mainly as a environment-friendly packing, since it is biodegradable. \n\nThis three step plan could very easily become a source of important marketing \n\ndifferentiation for Delta Q, as well as of added value proposition for end-customers, \n\nbecause plastic (even the biodegradable ones) tend to be cheaper than carton boxes. \n\nFurthermore, at 2nd level packing (grouped pack) biodegradable plastic could be \n\nintroduced. This swap doesn\u2019t need to be mass communicated. Instead it just needs to be \n\nwell explained and presented to channel partners, using the same argumentation used for \n\nend-customers market. At this level, the only main preoccupation for packing \n\nreengineering is the necessary resistance of the biodegradable film for adequate transport \n\nof 50 packs of 10 capsule-bags. \n\n \n\n9.5 Pricing assessment \n\nDELTA assumes social responsibility programs and environmental protection \n\ninvestments under the most restrict and traditional concepts of corporate responsibility as \n\ndiscussed above on chapter 6.1 regarding the philanthropic obligations of companies, to \n\ngive back to society, whom (somehow) contributed for company goal achievement \n\n(Carrol, 1999). \n\nThus DELTA internalizes the costs of all programs and investments related to social and \n\nenvironmental efforts. Whole improvements, certifications, international programs and \n\ninvolvement with community or ecological issues, are funded by the company, depleting \n\nthe operational profits. Of course this is only possible due to family type organization and \n\neffective shareholding of DELTA group. \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n\nThe Delta Q pricing is based on the sum of costs (including green coffee imports and \n\nindustrial toasting and milling), packaging, marketing and distribution. In balance with \n\nnet profit contribution goals for the brand, distribution costs and shelve investments, are \n\nkept within the boundaries of the marketing leader pricing. \n\nLike any other FMCG product present in the hyper and supermarkets distribution \n\nnetworks, Delta Q is periodically stimulated with price lowering or quantity campaigns, \n\nresulting much more from store networks pressure, than from product marketing strategy \n\nor demand side pressures. \n\nIn consequence, no social or environmental challenges are reflected in pricing. This is in \n\naccordance with the absence of green or community involvement product (or brand) \n\ncommunication, and leaves not enough space maneuvering for an environmental pricing \n\nprocess. Due to Delta Q\u2019s own birth process (by demand pressure) in addition to the \n\nelected strategic marketing positioning as a \u201cfollower\u201d, pricing strategies redound \n\nimmediately in closed set of options. No accounting processes were developed in order to \n\ninternalize and transfer eco-costs, or to fund the multiple projects, programs and \n\ninvestments held by the company in relation to environmental protection, waste \n\nmanagement or social responsibility. Thus, also in pricing, Delta Q must follow the \n\nproduct category leader and restraint its aims, to practice some price. \n\nAgain, the lack of open publicity on relevant and wide ecological and social achievements \n\nby DELTA, obliterate important (and deserved) marketing positioning and strategies \n\noptions. Efforts being made regarding raising awareness of end-customers for the need of \n\nused capsule recycling, could benefit a lot if marketing management could encourage \n\ncustomers to keep and deposit capsules on the collection spots, with some money prize. \n\nOf course this kind of strategy would need the support of really effective special \n\ncommunication and \u201cgreen\u201d premium price, to allow giving some money back to the \n\ncustomer. \n\n\n\n \n\n122 \n\nAlthough this is a bit risky strategy, since it leaves room for the competition price \n\nincreases without any significant effort to justify it. Clear communication of campaign \n\nobjectives and effective implementation of a simple money prize procedure, could easily \n\nobviate the risk. According to Kotler and Keller (2005) many empiric experiences result \n\non unexpected end-customer positive price elasticity, and do not drive to market-share \n\nloss, when a proper price strategy is set in place. \n\nMoreover, reducing ecological foot-print could very well be a perfect justification to limit \n\nprice conditions for distribution networks or to pitch a quantity campaign, in order to \n\nreduce the number of lorry deliveries. \n\n \n\n9.6 Distribution channels assessment \n\n9.6.1 Boundaries imposed to Delta Q production and selling systems due \ndistribution channels requisites \n\nThe boundaries Delta Q faces to coffee business development emerging from the \n\nmarketing and distribution channels system are not specifically different from other \n\nindustries. In fact, coffee industry is probably one of the most eco-efficient businesses \n\nregarding distribution network constraints. \n\nPortuguese distribution networks, along with other southern Europe counterparts are very \n\nrobust and mature (Rousseau, 1997). From their stand, it is very efficiently organized \n\nunder a concept pre environmental concerns and reverse logistics, of \u201cone-way\u201d mass \n\ndistribution. They are near-optimal efficient regarding goods inbound and reception, shelf \n\nreplenishment (mostly assured by brands\u2019 employees) and managing providers for long \n\naccount payment periods. Within these approach goods handling and easy packs stocking \n\nbecame critical to end quickly the distribution operations cycle. Thus all packing \n\nrequisites mentioned above, mainly 2nd and 3rd level packing, were developed taking more \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n\ninto regard physical distribution operations, than cost efficiency, or environmental \n\nperformance. \n\nHowever, under sustainable marketing framework approach, some intervention \n\nopportunities arise. Distribution operation systems reengineering with the environmental \n\ncommitment is possible, at a very low cost or even, with important savings. These could \n\nbe undertaken by two tools from the framework, which are rethinking product as services \n\nand reverse logistics development. The 3rd level packing (transport unit) could be changed \n\nfor reusable containers with same dimensions and capacity. 2nd level packing (distribution \n\npacking) could also suffer changes or even be eliminated if accompanied with an efficient \n\nstore replenishment software, linking the supermarket store with DELTA plant. This \n\nwould allow the implementation of a JIT44 production, storing and distribution \n\nphilosophy, which is widely grounded and firmly proved. \n\nWith this approach, reverse logistics implementation can be leveraged, once it would \n\nallow the back transport of collected used capsules with dreg, but also to collect back to \n\nsales departments warehouses and plant, the transport and distribution packs for refilling. \n\n \n\n9.6.2 Energy and pollution intensity from raw and subsidiary material \ntransportation to plant \n\nDue to Delta Q plant location at Campo Maior, the company faces important inbound \n\ncosts regarding green coffee and subsidiary material. Moreover, Portuguese distribution \n\nlogistics is organized under a road transportation concept, which very much limits \n\ncompany\u2019s distribution system options.  \n\nThis is a major problem not only for Portuguese business companies, but also for country \n\neconomy, since over dependency on lorry handling of goods accounts for an important \n\n                                                 \n44 JIT stands for just in time logistics management approach. \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n\nquota of oil imports and carbon emissions. This is also the main reason for the intense \n\necological footprint that characterizes the vast majority of Portuguese industry sector. \n\nDELTA is aware of this reality and with the extreme environmental concern, was decisive \n\non leading a wide interest group to set up a container platform at the nearby city of Elvas \n\n(17 kms from Campo Maior). \n\nAs a result the daily Lorries come-and-go between Lisbon and DELTA\u2019s plant ceased, \n\nand was substituted by two merchandise trains a day. \n\nThis shift represents a substantial improvement towards reducing carbon (and by the way, \n\nfuel energy consumption) footprint, by saving 226 kms lorry trip several times a day. \n\nFollowing is a map which shows the distance between Lisbon and Campo Maior, once \n\ncovered daily by lorry and now substituted by merchandise trains: \n\n \n\nFigure 9.9 - Green coffee transport to plant \n\n \n\n \n\n9.6.3 Energy consumption due to distribution channels \n\nAs already explained, Portuguese logistics are based on road transportation. Most of the \n\ntimes is not an option for a company to consider other transport and delivery systems. \n\nSince Delta Q is an FMCG45 product and due to the capillarity of the marketing channels, \n\nwho impose a wide point-of-sale presence in order to maximize product rotation and \n\n                                                 \n45 FMCG stands for fast moving consumer goods. \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n\nachieve increased sales (Marketing Channels, 2007), there is (so far) no other options \n\navailable to delivery systems but lorry transportation between plant and distribution \n\ncentres (both from DELTA and hyper and supermarkets chains). The distribution to stores \n\nis made by smaller vans. \n\nThis rationalized distribution architecture allowed DELTA to manage outbound logistics \n\nin a cost-effective manner and lower, as far as it is operational and economical viable, the \n\npollution associated with marketing and distribution function. \n\nAnother theoretical distribution and delivery of goods systems to end-customers like \n\npostal delivery need further consumer awareness and major changes in buying behaviour, \n\nbesides the highly direct costs associated, that are out of reach of DELTA\u2019s marketing \n\nefforts by itself. \n\nAlternative transport systems between plant and DELTA\u2019s sales-departments warehouses, \n\nlike the railway, are only partially possible for some of them. The lack of global \n\nreengineering of distribution logistics on these terms, due to the excessive cost and \n\ncoexistence of several distribution systems at the same time, make it organizational and \n\neconomicaly unviable. \n\nThe use of electric powered distribution vehicles isn\u2019t so far of practical implementation \n\nbut state of the art EPV46 lack of operational autonomy and price lowering due to the \n\nabsence of mass marketing. \n\nIn conclusion, the company as a whole and Delta Q distribution operations, are highly \n\nenergy consuming (and an important pollution source) due to Portuguese transportation \n\ninfrastructures and consumer demands and behaviour. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n46 EPV stands for electrical powered vehicle. \n\n\n\n \n\n126 \n\n9.6.4 Waste production due to distribution channels \n\nDistribution channel waste production relates mainly to 2nd and 3rd levels packing \n\n(grouping and transport) that becomes rubbish after each of the distribution stages and \n\nbefore final product consumption. For the purposes of waste production analysis, \n\ndistribution channels must be divided into two major segments: hyper and supermarkets \n\non one side and professional and domestic end-customer, on the other. \n\nIn the case of the hyper and supermarkets related channels, transport and grouping packs \n\nconsist essentially of pallets, retractile-plastic and large carton boxes, which fulfil their \n\npurpose at this stage and become rubbish.  \n\nFortunately, in Portugal, this waste category is largely recovered since early launching of \n\nPonto Verde system, which assures the collection and further recycling for pallets, \n\nretractile-plastics and carton boxes. Of course not all the wastes produced enter the waste \n\nrecycle chain, which poses a problem due to many little bits of uncollected scrap from \n\neach warehouse or supermarket facility. It is one of the inefficiencies of the systems that \n\ndemand further improvement. \n\nRegarding the professional and domestic end-customer distribution segments, it is where \n\nthe waste generation mostly occurs due to product consumption. First stage, at home or \n\noffices correspond to 10 capsules carton-box disposal. The second stage corresponds to \n\ncapsule and dreg disposal. \n\nAlthough most of the country's cities are already covered with a selected domestic waste \n\ncollection system, which allows families to separate it into three groups: carton and paper, \n\nmetallic and plastic, and glass, the collection systems do not cover all urban and \n\nindustrial/commercial areas. Thereby the capsules with dreg from Delta Q do not fit any \n\nof the above mentioned groups, once they are made of plastic, aluminium film and \n\n\n\n \n\n127 \n\ncontain dreg, which invalidate its collection for plastic recovery, and drives used capsules \n\nto terminal disposal at landfills. \n\nThis was the main reason for DELTA to launching the Rethink-Eco-Project program, due \n\nto lack of adequate treatment of used capsules by municipality's waste collection systems \n\n(both with a selective collection and undifferentiated collection). \n\n \n\n9.6.5 Workforce training on environmental issues \n\nDELTA employees do not receive special environmental training. However, their \n\ncomprehensive welcome process and corporate training programs cover deeply all the \n\nissues that the company is involved with, like sustainable coffee origins, Fair Trade, eco-\n\nefficiency, Rethink-Eco-Project program among all the other already listed (see chapter \n\n9.2.7). \n\n \n\n9.6.6 Sustainability criteria for partners and providers selection \n\nRegarding green coffee, the company is deeply committed with environmental and social \n\nresponsibility issues, like training farmer communities, child education and health and \n\nsafety life conditions. \n\nIn what refers to the subsidiary materials and other inbounds necessary for product \n\nprocess and packing, there are essentially requisites defined by environmental company\u2019s \n\nown goals. This is justified for two orders of reasons. First, for some critical inputs like \n\nnatural gas, there are no alternative providers in the Portuguese market. Second, for the \n\nremaining inputs where selection is possible, the choice is made on the pre-requisites of \n\nthe item being purchased, and not on the environmental performance of the company that \n\nproduces or sells it, as it is the case of the capsule\u2019s polymer, which the absolute initial \n\n\n\n \n\n128 \n\npre-requisite was the recyclability, and so it became a basic specification for the project\u2019s \n\nprovider selection. \n\n \n\n9.6.7 Reverse logistics as a cost or profit centre \n\nReverse logistics are a fact since the Rethink project launch. In the first stage it covered \n\nthe back circuit from company\u2019s sales departments, where initial Delta Q capsule's \n\ncollection baskets were placed. It later has widened to cover also professional end-\n\ncustomer segment, assured by company\u2019s own distribution systems. At a second stage, \n\nwith protocol establishment with hyper and supermarkets distribution chains, was \n\npossible to grow dramatically the number of capsules and dreg collected by reverse \n\nlogistics for recovery. \n\nSo far, reverse logistics is a cost centre, totally funded by company, degrading industrial \n\nand trade margins. However, Rethink project development is expected to reverse this \n\nreality, since the high potential value laid on dreg reuse, and recycling of polymer \n\ncapsules into new coffee machine manufacturing. \n\n \n\n9.7 Promotion and communication assessment \n\n9.7.1 Delta Q\u2019s environmental and sustainable communication \n\nDelta Q by itself has no special ecosystem or sustainable characteristics that can be used \n\nto project and/or communicate the company\u2019s commitment to ecosystems stewardship \n\nand social responsibility. What makes Delta Q a more ecological friendly product is the \n\nprocesses the company deployed from coffee business upstream trough downstream to \n\nend-user markets, regarding social responsibility and environmental commitment. For this \n\nreason, the coffee capsule recyclability was a pre-requisite for Delta Q's project. \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n\nMore recently, Rethink-Eco-Project was launched to find and develop economical viable \n\nprocesses to collect used capsules and to add significant value to the coffee grounds. \n\nDELTA does not use any of these important projects and abilities to communicate and \n\nadvertise Delta Q. In fact, regarding mass market communication, the company has \n\nassumed a follower strategy based on irreverence, due to lesser communication budget. \n\nThis is the opposite strategy from the main competitor, who massively invests in media, \n\naligned with worldwide company\u2019s global communication campaigns. \n\nDelta Q's communication efforts regarding initiatives related to reducing the brand \n\necological footprint, are still focused on interviews and magazine reports, and some press \n\nreleases when Rethink-Eco-Project was launched. \n\nThe same approach applies to the numerous company social initiatives, which receive \n\nonly local media coverage or specialized media, losing opportunity to leverage company \n\nand brands awareness trough wide media coverage of brand\u2019s environmental friendly \n\nfeatures and special community and researching projects associated. \n\nThe absence of larger marketing and communication budgets looks to have inhibited \n\nDELTA of fully projecting its social and sustainability projects' trough the means of mass \n\ncommunication, and making poor use of bellow the line communication strategies. Here \n\nis a wide landscape of innovation and opportunity to be explored and enhanced. \n\n \n\n9.7.2 DELTA historical commitment with environment and CSR \n\nDELTA\u2019s history and its early involvement and commitment to the community and \n\nenvironmental issues, provided the first social certification for the industry in Portugal, is \n\nprobably the best history possible to project a corporate, responsible and ecological \u201cde \n\nfacto\u201d image and able to build an important marketing differentiation advantage, as \n\npresented above (see chapter 8 \u2013 DELTA Caf\u00e9s). \n\n\n\n \n\n130 \n\nHowever, the company does not take advantage of this so rich history in their current \n\nmarketing communication. All efforts to project to markets company\u2019s deep involvement \n\nin social and sustainable projects are developed under the form of press conferences, press \n\nreleases and company owned communication channels like the websites and the DELTA \n\nMagazine, with limited audience and poor notoriety leveraging. \n\nThere are plenty of opportunities to power up the whole company\u2019s projects and \n\nachievements regarding social responsibility and environment protection, with minor \n\ninvestment costs and just by adding current communication and advertising campaigns \n\nwith already done or in progress projects. \n\nCapsule recyclability and spots to used capsule collection, or the deep involvement with \n\nfarmer communities with sustainability in the origins program, allow to achieve a \u201cgreen\u201d \n\nawareness and to differentiate Delta Q on customer mind, providing them with important \n\nmeans for buying behaviour and decision reference modification, in favour of the brand. \n\n \n\n9.7.3 Environmental certification and labeling \n\nRegarding the labeling issue, a dual situation emerges, taking into account Delta Q and \n\nthe remaining coffee brands. On one side, there is some sort of company\u2019s environmental \n\nand social commitment statement on the back of coffee packs, pursuant to type II labeling \n\nstep emerging from ISO 14001 series certification (Hortensius and Barthel, 1997)47. \n\nAlthough that labeling none of them, clearly evidence the social or environmental \n\ncertifications achieved by DELTA. On the other side Delta Q packs completely omits \n\nwhole company involvement and commitment to sustainability and social responsibility \n\nissues. \n\n                                                 \n47\n\n In Sheldon, Christopher (1997), ISO 14001 and beyond: Environmental management Systems in the \nreal world, Greenleaf Publishing, Sheffield, UK. \n\n\n\n \n\n131 \n\nOnce again, important marketing differentiation and advantages strategies are being miss-\n\nused or poorly leveraged. On the traditional product lines (both for professional and end-\n\nuser markets), DELTA packaging communication strategy lacks to tell the market the \n\nproud involvement of the company with actively promotion of coffee origins \n\nsustainability, fair price trade, and social enhancement of local farmers education and \n\nliving conditions. The sustainable development statement printed on coffee packs back, is \n\ntoo long to provoke brain-impact memorization, and risks being miss-understood, due to \n\nthe logotype not belonging to any national or international certification organization. This \n\noption constitutes a missing opportunity since DELTA has a social and environmental \n\ncertification and has successfully implemented EMAS audit systems. \n\nThose awards and management systems should be shared with the whole end-customers. \n\nDelta Q packing faces several restrictions due to target end-market and tight image \n\nfollowing strategy with main international competition. However, there is no risk for any \n\nbrand damage, by associating Delta Q brand with social or environmental certification \n\nmarks. Most of the end-markets companies which started to print these certifications in \n\ntheir product packs faced an overall awareness increase and, many times, also sales \n\ngrowth (Ackerstein and Lemon, 1999; Rios, Mart\u00ednez, Moreno and Soriano, 2006; Shen \n\nand Chang, 2009). \n\nMoreover, according to Carolina Afonso (2009), there is a growing number of the so-\n\ncalled green consumers with a very well established psychographic profile, like higher \n\ngrade education and above average income. These consumers present a high rate \n\nconversion between green-products buying intention and effective buying (even in the \n\nPortuguese contracted market). Thus, it seems that important consumer trends are being \n\ndisregarded, what can cause future problems by later communication with those end-\n\nmarkets. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n132 \n\n9.7.4 DELTA\u2019s marketing channel communication on environmental and \nsocial commitment \n\nThe company is developing a bold and important effort to gather supporters and effective \n\npartners for its programs and initiatives, both throughout supply chain and distribution \n\nnetworks. DELTA\u2019s Rethink-Eco-Project involves directly the hyper and supermarkets \n\nnetworks once they constitute central crossing hotspots for customers with high \n\naccessibility, both for buying processes and for used capsule collection. \n\nFurthermore, distribution and logistics personnel are deep involved with these efforts in \n\norder to motivate and widespread the need and easiness of the environmental protection \n\ntrough behavioural enhancement and habits change towards waste valorization and value \n\nharnessing from capsules collection and coffee grounds recycling. \n\nFrom supply side, there is also important care to find and trade with coffee providers deep \n\ninvolved with environmental and social issues. This is an outcome from sustainability at \n\nthe origins program. Not forgetting the Shadow and Rainforest Alliance blends. \n\nRemaining suppliers are taught about company social and environmental commitments by \n\ntraditional communication channels like the media, press release, DELTA\u2019s specific \n\nwebsite for sustainability and by DELTA\u2019s magazine. \n\n \n\n9.7.5 Top management involvement regarding social and environmental \ncommunication \n\nCompany top management presents a full breath commitment and involvement with \n\nsocial and environmental responsibility, assuming the role of the main projects and \n\nprograms drivers. This involvement can be seen in two complementary dimensions: the \n\ngovernance level and trough public/media involvement. \n\n\n\n \n\n133 \n\nRegarding the first dimension, since recent years, is widely accepted the positive and \n\ndeterminant impact of CEO48 commitment for CSR and environmental projects \n\nimplementation and success. DELTA top management is deeply embodied with the issues \n\nconcerning sustainability. Beyond plain image and presence on events to support \n\nresponsibility projects, also as a result from environmental and social certifications, was \n\ncreated a formal sustainability management system with a full time manager and an \n\nannual working plan and budgeting (see chapter 9.2.1 \u2013 Company Environmental \n\nStatement). \n\nOn the second dimension, DELTA\u2019s top management is regularly present and heads the \n\npublic presentations49 on social and environmental subjects. By media interviews, press \n\nconferences and issuing special reports on important milestones achieved50, or by \n\nendorsing the academic researching projects51. \n\n \n\n9.7.6 Sales-force sustainability and social responsibility training \n\nSocial responsibility and environmental protection are covered by sales force training. \n\nHowever, it is not a special chapter of it but rather another component of the general sales \n\nforce training programs, where the trainees become aware and familiar with the deep \n\ncommitment of the company with social responsibility for local communities (both in \n\nPortugal and coffee sourcing countries), the programs and investments held for it, and \n\nwhat should be sales-representatives behaviour and speech accordingly. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n48 CEO stands for Chief Executive Officer. \n49 http://www.mydeltaq.com/Default.aspx?ID=569&amp;Action=1&amp;NewsId=67&amp;PID=1394, 27/02/20011. \n50 http://imagensdemarca.sapo.pt/dossier/detalhes.php?id=496, 27/02/2011. \n51 http://www.portaldoestudante.uevora.pt/media/informacoes/premio_anual_ \nbiodiversidade_delta_cafes_2010, 27/02/2011. \n\n\n\n \n\n134 \n\n9.7.7 DELTA\u2019s environmental and sustainability advertising campaigns \n\nThe company does not communicate its deep involvement with environmental and \n\nsustainability in their media advertising campaigns. DELTA as a whole, including Delta \n\nQ is a poor media communication investor, and practices a following strategy from the \n\nmain competitors. This becomes clear when Delta Q advertising used George Clooney\u2019s \n\n(worldwide Nespresso brand face) unknown girlfriend. Even taking into account the \n\nhumorous feeling of the ad's storyboard it is still a follower's strategy. \n\nDELTA's strategy miss-use the tremendous potential of marketing differentiation and \n\nadvantages, that emerge from the communication of DELTA\u2019s deep commitment with \n\nsocial responsibility initiatives and environmental programs. \n\nMore and more consumers, in face of environmental problems and growing waste \n\nproduction, are increasing their buying intentions and effective buying of green-products \n\n(Carolina Afonso, 2009). Hence the lack of wide communication of DELTA\u2019s \u201cgreen \n\nconcerns\u201d, programs and investments, and moreover, the real achievements and \n\nimprovements regarding environment and social responsibility, is itself a wasted \n\nopportunity. Not only for Delta Q awareness, but mainly a lost opportunity to raise \n\nenvironmental and sustainability awareness from DELTA\u2019s end-customers. \n\n \n\n10 SUSTAINABLE MARKETING ASSESSMENT \n\nIn possession of the data gathered trough the interviews and content analysis in order to \n\nanswer the issues raised from the sustainable marketing audit checklist, it is possible to \n\ndraw an accurate product\u2019s profile regarding the overall pursued strategy, against P2 \n\n(pollution prevention) and R2 (resource recovery) basic goals. \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n\nAs previously discussed, this profiling naturally results in a SWOT analysis, which \n\npresents the advantage of clearly listing the future strategies building blocks emerging \n\nfrom product\u2019s strengths in conjunction with product\u2019s opportunities. \n\nAlong the following SWOT analysis, several times will be referred \u201cthe company\u201d \n\ninstead of the product-specific being audited, once in those cases it is impossible to \n\nclearly, identify, the driver of the process (or procedure) being analysed from the product \n\nitself. On the other hand, because it makes no sense to discuss the specific toasting \n\nprocess of Delta Q, since this process is common for all brands and blends from the \n\ncompany. \n\n \n\n10.1 Delta Q SWOT analysis resume \n\n \n\nTable 10.1 \u2013 Delta Q\u2019s Sustainable marketing SWOT analysis \n\nStrengths Weaknesses \n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 High target-markets awareness. \n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 High end-customers brand trust. \n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 End-customers are loyal to brand.

The tradition and commitment to social and environmental issues \n\npatented by DELTA nurture a positive context to develop and launch responsible \n\nproducts. Delta Q holds some important ecological stress due to industrial processes and \n\ndistribution, waste generation on production, distribution and consumption cycles, and \n\nissues associated with terminal disposal (both capsules and later coffee-machine). The \n\nway the management team addressed these challenges and developed projects to deal with \n\nnegative impacts, provides a favourable product positioning regarding P2 (pollution \n\nprevention) and R2 (resource recovery) goals. \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n\nDespite those problems, Delta Q is clearly on the right sustainable path, and positions \n\nitself almost halfway to be a highly pollution preventer product, and just over a mid track \n\ntowards resource recovery goals, as presented in the figure bellow. \n\nIn the same figure was also represented a tentative positioning of the main competitor for \n\nbenchmarking purposes. The de deduction of Nespresso positioning against P2 and R2 \n\ngoals was made upon the disclosed data on brand environmental involvement conveyed \n\nthrough press and from the product's website on the subject53. \n\n \nFigure 10.1 - Delta Q positioning to P2 and R2 goals \n\n \n\n \n\nRegarding P2 goals, Delta Q shows an important environmental impact, especially trough \n\nenergy consumption and waste generation along product\u2019s PSLC (Product-system -Life-\n\ncycle). On one side, there are the capsule related issues, like polymer production (from \n\noil) and subsidiary materials for industrial processing and marketing (mainly packing \n\nscrap generation). \n\nOn the other side are the exclusive coffee-machine related issues like polymer production, \n\nrestricted use of such a device (strictly for quality coffee domestic consumption), and \n\nterminal disposition of equipment. Although early pre-requisites for the product like \n                                                 \n53\n\n http://www.ecolaboration.com/mediacenter/#/startpage/, January 2011. \n http://www.ecolaboration.com/#/aaa/pt/, January 2011. \n http://www.ecolaboration.com/#/aaa/en/factsheets, January 2011. \n http://www.ecolaboration.com/#/aaa/en/questions-and-answers, January 2011. \n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n\ncapsule recyclability, the need to involve and actively commit the end-consumer and \n\ndrive his consumption behaviour to change, in order to achieve environmental impact \n\nminimization for product life cycle, remains a long path to walk towards product \n\nsustainability. The absence of proper and efficient end-customer communication and \n\nadequate incentives to drive consumer decision models and consumption behaviour \n\nchange makes P2 goals harder to achieve. \n\nDelta Q patents a better positioning regarding R2 goals due to the company own \n\nenvironmental and social commitment and most innovative and comprehensive projects \n\nlike Rethink-Eco-Project. \n\nDELTA\u2019s efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, to bring waste treatment to the level (already \n\nachieved) of zero toxic waste, and packaging waste generation close monitoring, provides \n\nproduct upwards improvement on the scale. Complementary, Rethink-Eco-Project \n\nobjectives like old coffee machines and polymer capsules recycling for further \n\nincorporation in new capsules and coffee machines are also most relevant for R2 \n\npositioning. The early results about dreg valorization and capsules recycling contribute \n\ndecisively to overcome half-scale R2 positioning. \n\n \n\n10.3 Conclusions \n\nDelta Q, due to P2 and R2 goals positioning and company\u2019s social and ecological \n\nresponsibility, awareness and commitment, faces unique opportunities for marketing \n\nperformance enhancement and sustainability development achievement. As a result, \n\nstrategic options available are defined in the matrix bellow: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n\nFigure 10.2 - Delta Q strategic environmental matrix positioning \n\n \n\n \n\nAvailable strategies are framed by market penetration trough product strategy \n\nenhancement, or trough market development strategy, respectively for current target \n\nmarkets or new markets as is the case of Delta Q Spanish market penetration. \n\nThe relative worst P2 score is justified mainly by the necessity to involve end-customer \n\ntowards decision-making models and consumption behaviour changing. To do so require \n\na bold communication strategy shift and investment, which is a result of both previous \n\nmatrixes cross analysis, market penetration and market development has much to do with \n\nbroad brand communication and product development to become more environmental \n\nfriendly. \n\nIn the case of abroad markets, proper communication strategy on the product ecological \n\nperformance and responsible consumer behaviour, supported by early reverse logistics \n\nsystem implementation, could very well be the key for greater and sustainable success. \n\nOnce the core benefit of product cannot be changed, penetration and development \n\nstrategies deal essentially with: \n\n1) Minor incremental product fine-tuning to become lesser ecological harmful. \n\n2) Development of broad end-consumer awareness and engagement on active \n\nbehaviour changes to reduce waste disposal environmental impact. This is to \n\nparticipate actively in the recycling process. \n\n\n\n \n\n142 \n\nThese are R2 strategies, looking for comprehensive waste collection and increased \n\nrecycling efficiency towards full waste recovery and re-injection onto the productive \n\ncycle. No matter if it is the coffee cycle or any other useful manufacturing, as long as it \n\nprevents used coffee capsules and dreg to end at the landfill, without further treatment or \n\nvalorization. \n\nOf course technology plays a major role to achieve R2 goals, since there are to be \n\ndeveloped yet, economic and industrial viable solutions in order to treat and add more \n\nvalue to dreg. Rethink-Eco-Project is a very good example of the effort to be made and \n\nperhaps, sustained, in order to fully achieve P2 and R2 Goals. \n\n \n\n11 RECOMMENDATIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH \n\n11.1 Business recommendations \n\nSustainable marketing audit, like common audits is a tool for management to make better \n\ndecisions by identifying under performing areas or processes, by benchmarking, or simply \n\nby questioning and stimulating managers to do some serious critical thinking about their \n\nareas or processes of responsibility. \n\nPresent audit was developed on a brand from a group with utmost awareness and \n\ncommitment with social responsibility and environment protection towards sustainability. \n\nHowever, some of the marketing mix variables are being poorly managed in face of the \n\nimportant DELTA\u2019s social and ecological achievements perfectly aligned with P2 and R2 \n\nbasic goals. To correctly implement a comprehensive sustainable marketing strategy and \n\ntake full advantage of the achievements already made by DELTA, would be advisable to \n\nimplement the following measures, to be understand as a road-map, since it would require \n\nmore in-depth financial and marketing analysis: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n\n1) Target market segment assessment \u2013 As much as a company feel safe and \n\ngrounded on demand pressure from \u201cloyal\u201d end-customers to launch a new \n\nproduct, or significantly modify an existing one it is sound advised to perform a \n\ndeep marketing research. Present marketing research methods are far less \n\nexpensive than they used to be and provide a wide, reach and reliable knowledge \n\non the marketing or management problem under investigation. It reduces \n\nuncertainty dramatically, regarding the planned investments. \n\nThis rational also applies for an already marketed product, since it provides \n\ninsights on end-customers behaviour and decision models, consumption drivers \n\nand motivations, estimates market size, delimits price flotation band, preferred \n\npacking, selling unit dimension regarding consumer and distribution preferences \n\nand requisites, among many other critical insights to make strategic marketing \n\ndecisions more as conscientious options than guessing art or empirical \n\nexperiments. \n\n \n\n2) Pricing \u2013 Absence of a proper market study for Delta Q makes it impossible to \n\nhave a proxy to test market price elasticity, and further establish a comprehensive \n\npricing process. However, it seems to be very difficult to internalize eco-costs (or \n\npart of them) from coffee production cycle. \n\nNevertheless, recent academic research and empiric evidence points towards some \n\nend-consumers willing to support a price increase for well perceived \n\nenvironmental product benefits, especially the growing green end-consumers \n\nniches (Ottman, 1992 and Catarina Afonso, 2009). \n\nTo be successful in such an endeavour, distribution channels networks and sales-\n\nteams must be totally involved in order to pitch correctly the price modifications \n\nand fighting the hyper and supermarkets trend to transpose price increases to end-\n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n\nconsumers, gaining better trade margins for themselves. Properly budgeted, \n\nplanned and communicated, such strategy presents every property to be well \n\nsucceeded, on trade margin creation, to reward the end-consumer behaviour \n\nchange towards an increasingly active role on collecting and depositing used \n\ncapsules into collection spots. \n\n \n\n3) Communication \u2013 Delta Q brand is making a very poor use of this strategic \n\nmarketing variable, by two sorts of reasons. On one side the assumed following \n\nstrategy presents very little chances of achieving any significant return on \n\ncommunication investment made, no matter how small it may be. Sustainable \n\nmarketing is also an intrinsic combat against every kind of resource waste, never \n\nminding if they are from the environment or from the company\u2019s marketing \n\nbudget. Even small resources could be more effectively spent on other most \n\nimportant communication objectives, like raising end-consumer awareness for \n\necological behaviour and waste avoidance. \n\nOn another side, the brand is forgetting the whole public recognised company\u2019s \n\ncommitment and achievements regarding social responsibility, absolute \n\ninnovative programs and ecological investments with government funded research \n\nprogram and international social and environmental certifications granted. \n\nThe first and urgent step is to stamp on Delta Q packs, the granted certifications \n\nlogos, regarding those issues, in a phased and planned manner. \n\n \n\n11.2 Discussion, limitations and further research \n\nThe present work is an exploratory research on Donald A. Fuller seminal work, which has \n\nresulted in the sustainable marketing framework. As far as it is possible to know, it is the \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n\nfirst attempt to operationalize the approach and to take advantage of the model to envision \n\na comprehensive sustainable marketing strategy for a product-specific already being \n\nmarketed, the capsulated coffee brand Delta Q. \n\nThe framework proved to be suitable for practical enforcement and to stimulate \n\nmanagement and marketers to think out of the box, questioning new processes, systems \n\nand other dimensions of the product\u2019s industrial and marketing dimensions. The waste \n\nmanagement approach trough the product-system life-cycle assessment brought into \n\nperspective a whole further comprehensive array of issues previously unexplored. \n\nMoreover, bi-dimensional matrix positioning of Delta Q regarding P2 and R2 Goals, \n\ndeveloped along research a clear perspective on what remains to be done regarding \n\nproduct and attached equipments, to implement an effective sustainable marketing \n\nstrategy and to achieve diminished environmental impact. \n\nAnother area where the framework came to be unexpectedly effective was \n\ncommunication. Sustainable marketing framework provides a comprehensive set of tools \n\nto assess effectively every dimension of marketing management decisions and processes. \n\nBy questioning and investigating the company\u2019s social and environmental achievement's \n\nprojection on end-markets was possible to identify an area of poor company and brand \n\nperformance, in face of what are the real company\u2019s commitments and achievements \n\nregarding environmental responsibility (P2 and R2 goals) towards sustainability. \n\nTherefore, the company is missing excellent awareness growth and marketing \n\ndifferentiation opportunities. Especially if one takes into account the most recent research \n\nand available indicators on \u201cgreen consumerism\u201d due to growing end-customers \n\nawareness for environmental issues, although often not being clear what are the behaviour \n\nmodels and decision drivers for environment-friendly products purchasing. \n\nSustainable marketing audit also proved to be a more valuable tool for company/brand \n\nperformance assessment and strategy building than the green model. According to Ottman \n\n\n\n \n\n146 \n\n(2006) the green marketing approach has been many times unsuccessful due to lack of \n\nend-customer insight on decision models, behaviour drivers and motivations. Therefore, it \n\nbecomes useless to invest in campaigns and communication strategies outside of end-\n\nconsumer concerns and awareness. \n\nOther times green marketing has suffered with poor product performance against P2 and \n\nR2 goals or lack of effective environmental features, what makes the task virtually \n\nimpossible. One should not conclude from above exposition, on green marketing \n\ninadequacy or lack of effectiveness. Contrariwise green marketing approach is very \n\npowerful for successful communication if product beholds true environmental \n\nenhancement or feature benefit that the end-customer value and apprehends. \n\nSustainable marketing as a comprehensive framework widely overcomes the narrow \n\ncompany-market communication perspective and goes further on questioning and \n\ndetailing the product processes from top to bottom. It goes deep in product design, brand \n\nmanagement terminal disposal or/and waste reinjection on the upstream of PSLC. It also \n\ncovers the supply chain side by investigating company\u2019s distribution channels, pricing \n\nprocess (including environmental cost internalization), communication strategy and end \n\nmarkets assessment. \n\nAbove all it is a strategic framework model with integrated operative tools, which \n\nprovides a coherent approach for marketing management processes, under a new \n\nparadigm approach. \n\nMoreover, sustainable marketing offers the tools to assess critically the product's \n\nperformance and company\u2019s profitability contribution, and to generate alternate processes \n\n(no matter if productive, transport, pricing, communication or packaging related) towards \n\nenhanced ecological stewardship and cost effectiveness. \n\nThose are the main benefits of a comprehensive approach to the issues emerging from \n\nsocial and environmental responsible management for the future. Sustainable marketing \n\n\n\n \n\n147 \n\ndoes not break with traditional marketing management theory, instead offers to conscious \n\nand pro marketers an important steps forward, by providing a systemic reference model \n\nthat evaluates every marketing (and management in general) decision against its impact \n\non environment. \n\nOf course, as a recent marketing science development, sustainable marketing needs to be \n\nfurther tested against more companies and different products, not forgetting the industrial \n\nmarkets. Above all this new approach deserves a full comprehensive testing, from \n\nfoundation theory to whole model's operationalization. \n\nOnce accomplished the diagnostic task and the product positioning against P2 and R2 \n\ngoals emerges the array of strategic options available. Following, trough the \n\nenvironmental dimension added to Ansoff\u2019s product/market matrix and the SWOT \n\nanalysis, the logic next step is to build a full sustainable marketing strategy within new \n\nsocial and environment boundaries. \n\nA bolder ambition would be then, to develop a full sustainable marketing strategy \n\nimplementation and monitoring, for necessary corrections and fine tuning. Such a \n\nendeavour could be set in motion trough an action-research project for two main reasons: \n\n1) Due to sustainable marketing framework novelty, it should be developed with a \n\nproject-team, to allow multiple theory interpretations, and to stimulate creativity; \n\n2) Since it is to be implemented, it necessarily demands an empowered management \n\nteam to be able to take decisions and to assure they are fulfilled by the company\u2019s \n\nstructure. \n\n \n\nAs a preliminary, qualitative and descriptive study, the research lacks of reliability due to \n\nthe absence of statistical validity. So, further research on the sustainable marketing \n\nframework should be conduced onto other products, markets and industries. However, \n\nmanagement problems could be similar, each product, market and industry presents their \n\nown specificities against whom the framework should be tested. \n\n\n\n \n\n148 \n\nAnother area where further empiric research would be desirable relates with the \n\ninternalization of the eco-costs of Delta Q in the pricing process. Such project would \n\nrequire intensive cost mapping and evaluating, and a full commitment of the marketing \n\ncommunication team, whom main concern should be the design of an adequate \n\ncommunication program, for target-markets, distribution partners and Delta Q\u2019s sales-\n\nforce. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n149
