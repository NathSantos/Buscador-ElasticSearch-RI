In countries with a high prevalence of\nseropositive animals, the main method of controlling\nIBR is vaccination of susceptible animals to reduce the\nvirus excretion, and to decrease the severity of clinical\nsigns (MUYLKENS et al., 2007; FLORES, 2007).\n\nA number of protective mechanisms against\ninfection with BoHV-1 have been described which\nessentially depend upon the induction of a wide\nspectrum of innate and specific mechanisms of cellular\nand humoral immune responses.

Some of the\nmechanisms such as complement activation are non-\nspecific, whereas others, such as interferons and early\npro-inflammatory cytokines are induced by virus\nreplication and lead to the recruitment and activation\nof di ffer ent  cel l s such  a s ma cr oph a ges,\npolymorphonuclear neutrophils and Natural Killer cells\nin cattle (MUYLKENS et al., 2007; JONES &amp;\nCHOWDHURY, 2008). The non-specific activated\nimmune cells are also essential in initiating and\nregulating the specific immune response to BoHV-1\n(BABIUK et al., 1996, MUYLKENS et al., 2007).\n\nSince current inactivated BoHV-1 vaccines\ngenerally induce strong humoral but weak cell-\nmediated immune responses, the success of vaccination\nhas been correlated to the ability of neutralizing\nantibodies to provide protection (MUYLKENS et al.,\n2007). Indeed, a correlation between neutralizing\nantibody responses and level of protection has been\ndemonstrated for BoHV-1 (LEMAIRE et al., 1994; VAN\nDRUNEN LITTEL-VAN DEN HURK et al., 1994;\nBABIUK et al., 1996). In addition to virus-neutralization,\nthe anti BoHV-1 antibodies can opsonize the virus,\nactivate the complement system, and can mediate the\nAntibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC)\n(JONES &amp; CHOWDHURY, 2008). Antibody function in\nvivo is chiefly linked to immunoglobulin isotype\n(McGUIRE et al., 1979), e.g. in bovines, IgG1 antibodies\ninteract with macrophages Fc receptors whereas IgG2\nantibodies interact with neutrophils Fc receptors\n(HOWARD et al., 1980). Anti-BoHV-1 isotype-specific\nresponses were reported and characterized for\nexperimentally infected cattle (GUY &amp; POTGIETER,\n1985; MADIC et al., 1995; BRADSHAW &amp; EDWARDS,\n1996). However, there are no consistent data in the\nliterature describing the role of antibody isotypes, or\neven their kinetic production profiles, in bovines\nimmunized with anti-BoHV-1 vaccines formulated with\nsuspensions containing inactivated viral particles. The\naim of this  research was to develop an experimental\nvaccine against the herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) using\nthe inactivated virus and to evaluate its immunogenicity\nin bovines by measuring the levels of neutralizing\nantibodies, as well as quantifying IgG1 and IgG2\nantibodies in the serum and in nasal secretions, over\ntime, following vaccination and revaccination.\n\nMATERIALS   AND   METHODS\n\nVaccine preparation\nThe virus strain used in vaccine production\n\nand in the virus neutralization test was the Los Angeles\n\n(ATCC-VR 188; USA). MDBK cell line (ATCC CCL-22)\nwas used for virus propagation. Cells were grown in\n150cm2 polystyrene T flasks (Corning, USA) using\nMinimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Cultilab, Brazil)\nsupplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum (Cultilab),\nwith the addition of sodium bicarbonate (Merck,\nGermany) adjusted to a final pH 7.0. Sub-cultivations\nwere carried out every 72h. To produce the vaccine, an\ninitial cellular inoculum of 0.2 x 106cells mL-1 was used.\nAfter 24 hours of incubation, this pre-formed MDBK\ncell monolayer was infected with 0.5mL of an 107,5 TCID50\nmL-1 suspension of BoHV-1 (107,2 TCID50) per 150cm2\nflasks in 60mL of infection medium, without adsorption\nstep. The infection medium did not contain bovine\nfoetal serum (BFS). Flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0C in\n5% CO2\n\n \n(Thermo Electron Corporation, USA) until 80-\n\n90% of the cell monolayer was destroyed by the virus.\nThis viral suspension was collected and centrifuged at\n2160xg (PR-2 centrifuge; International Equipment Co.,\nUSA) for 15min at 4\u00b0C for removal of cellular debris.\nInfectivity was determined in the supernatant and the\nviral titre was 107,8TCID50 ml-1. The final viral suspension\nwas stored at 4\u00b0C until the inactivation. The clarified\nand titrated viral suspension was inactivated using\n3mM (final concentration) binary ethylenimine (BEI) at\n26\u00b0C (BAHNEMANN, 1990) for 24 hours. The\ninactivation was stopped by the addition of a 1M sterile\nNa-thiosulphate solution at 10% of the volume of the\nBEI solution used. The suspension was tested for\nresidual infectivity by three consecutive passages of 5\ndays each in MDBK cultures (1mL of inactivated\nsuspen si on  i n 25cm 2 fl asks).  T he in acti va ted\nsuspension was then adsorbed onto 20% aluminium\nhydroxide (produced by Vall\u00e9e S.A, Brazil) as adjuvant\nat 4\u00b0C, for 12h. Each vaccine dose contained 4mL of\nthe inactivated viral suspension (total titre per dose:\n108,4 TCID50) and 1mL of adjuvant. No preservatives\nwere added.\n\nExperimental protocol\nSeventeen cross-bred heifers, aged between\n\n18 and 24 moths, seronegative for BoHV 1 (VN titer    2),\nwere divided in vaccinated group (12 animals) and\nunvaccinated control group (5 animals). Vaccinated\nheifers received 5mL of the experimental vaccine\nsubcutaneously, followed by an identical dose, 25 days\nlater, also subcutaneously. Blood was collected at 0, 9,\n18, 25, 32, 46, 60, 86, 114, 150, 210, 270 and 330 days\nafter the first vaccination and the serum was submitted\nto a temperature of 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes to inactivate\nthe complement components; after that, it was frozen\nuntil the analysis. Nasal secretions were collected on\n\n\n\n309Systemic and local antibodies induced by an experimental inactivated vaccine against bovine herpesvirus type 1.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.41, n.2, fev, 2011.\n\ncotton swabs (Inlab, Brazil) until 150 days post-\nvaccination (DPV). After that, the swab was placed in\nappropriate tubes containing 1mL of MEM with 1%\nantibiotic for transport to the laboratory. Tubes were\nagitated 30 seconds and centrifuged at 2160g at 4\u00b0C\nfor 10 minutes, and the supernatant was frozen until\nanalysis.\n\nEvaluation of the humoral immune response\nNeutralizing antibodies were measured by a\n\nstandard virus neutralization assay as described by\nOIE (2008). Serum samples were tested in duplicate.\nFor graphic representation of results, the VN antibody\ntitres were transformed in log2\n\n \nx+1, in which x is the VN\n\nantibody titre, because zero is not a valid value to\ncalculate log2.\n\nThe general procedure described by the\nsupplier of the ELISA kit for the detection of antibodies\nagainst Bovine Infectious Rhinotracheitis Virus\n(IDEXX, Westbrook, USA) was followed to measure\nthe anti-BoHV-1 antibody isotypes in serum and nasal\nswab samples, except for the use of anti-bovine IgG1\nor anti-bovine IgG2 peroxidase conjugates (Bethyl\nLaboratories, Montgomery, USA) to replace the anti-\nbovine total IgG peroxidase conjugate supplied in the\nkit. The optimal dilutions for anti-IgG1 and anti-IgG2\nconjugates were determined by checkerboard titration\nusing as diluent phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with\n0.05% Tween 20 (Merck, Germany) and 1.5%\novoalbumin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Pools of 6 negative,\n\nand 6 strong positive sera in the virus neutralizing test\nwere used to standardize the controls for anti-BoHV-1\nIgG1 and anti-IgG2 antibodies. The reading of optical\ndensities (OD) was recorded in an ELISA Multiskan\nAscent (Thermo Lasystems, USA) microplate reader\nat 650nm. The sample to positive values (S/P) was\ncalculated by the following formula:\nS/P = Z-X/Y-X (Where Z = OD of the test sample (serum\nor nasal secretion), X = OD of the negative control,\nand Y = OD of the positive control).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe Kruskall\u2013Wallis non-parametric test\n\nwas used for the analysis of neutralizing antibody titres\nand of S/P values of each antibody isotype and, when\na significant difference between medians was evident,\nDunn\u00b4s non-parametric test was applied. Differences\nin P value of     0.05 were considered significant. Linear\nregression analysis was performed to determine the\nrelationship between the two variables. Pearson\u2019s\ncorrelation coefficient was also calculated.\n\nRESULTS   AND   DISCUSSION\n\nSystemic virus-neutralizing antibody responses\nRelevant anti-BoHV-1 VN antibody titres\n\ndeveloped in serum of vaccinated animals remained at\nmoderate to high levels from 25 to 210DPV (Figure 1).\nNo relevant VN antibody titres were detected in non-\nvaccinated animals for the entire post-vaccination\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Kinetics of hu moral immune responses in seru m of vaccinated and\nrevaccinated animals measu red as viru s-neu tralizing anti BoHV-1\nantibody titres (Log2 reciprocal of the highest dilution) and IgG1 and\nIgG2 specific anti-viral antibody levels (S/P values in indirect ELISA).\n\n\n\n310 Cilento et al.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.41, n.2, fev, 2011.\n\nperiod investigated. After the first vaccination, a\nmaximum of 41.6% (5 out of 12 heifers) of the immunized\nanimals showed a slight elevation of virus-neutralizing\nantibody production (Figure 1). The revaccination\nresulted in a significant rise in VN-antibody titres, which\nwas characterized by more than doubling in log2\n\n \nof the\n\nantibody titres (P<0.01) (Figure 1). The anti-BoHV-1\nmedian VN-antibody titres reached the acceptable\nthreshold value (    Log2=3, according to Code of Federal\nRegulation, US, 2006) and remained at this level in\n100% of the animals until 60DPV. The median VN\nantibodies began to decline towards slightly low titres\n(Log2=2.32    VN titres     Log2=2.74), from 86 to 210DPV,\nand became negative in the last two sampling times,\n270 and 330DPV (Figure 1). The evolution of median\nVN antibody titres showed also that the highest\npercen tages (50-100%) of vaccinat ed a nima ls\nharbouring a cceptable levels of these antibodies\n(Log2    3) were reached between 32 to 115DPV and\ndeclined afterwards to 25-33.3% (150-270DPV). These\nresults, particularly the kinetic profile of the humoral\nimmune response to BoHV-1, resembled to that found,\neither after the administration of one or two doses of\ninactivated vaccines (CAMPOS et al., 1990; FULTON\net al., 1995). Despite the decline in neutralizing antibody\ntitres, the possibility that animals might yet be\nprotected against the clinical signs induced by an\ninfection of the BoHV-1 cannot be rejected. It has been\nreported that vaccinated calves, even exhibiting low\nanti-BoHV-1 antibody titres, showed a peak in the anti-\nviral antibodies in response to challenge performed\nafter six months of vaccination, as a consequence of\nan anamnestic response that might have contributed\nto a significant reduction of respiratory clinical signs\ninduced by the virus (PETERS et al., 2004). Additionally,\nthe aluminium hydroxide used as adjuvant in the\ncurrent investigation may have contributed to the early\ndecline of anti-BoHV-1 neutralizing antibody titres, since\nits deposit effect is lower than f mineral oil (CAMPOS\net al., 1990; FULTON et al., 1995). Based on these results,\nit should be recommended to revaccinate the animals\nevery six months.\n\nSystemic and local IgG1 and IgG2 anti-BoHV-1 antibody\nresponses\n\nAs  it was tested an inactivated BoHV-1\nvaccine containing aluminium hydroxide, which is a\ngood inducer of IgG antibody responses, but is not\nefficient in raising IgA antibodies (GUPTA, 1998), only\nIgG1 and IgG2 anti-BoHV-1 isotypes were evaluated in\nthis study.\n\nThe first vaccine dose elicited a slight rise\nin the levels of systemic IgG1 and IgG2 antiviral\n\nantibodies, early as 18DPV, and the revaccination (25\nDPV) induced a typical anamnestic response of both\nisotypes, which was characterized by a sharp increase\nin the levels of these antibody isotypes after 32 to\n60DPV (Figure 1). The levels of IgG1 and IgG2\nantibodies started to decline at 86DPV, maintaining\nmoderate levels until 150DPV, and from this point on,\nthese antibodies presented a marked reduction (210-\n330DPV). The kinetics of the systemic response of anti\nBoHV-1 antibodies induced by the experimental vaccine\ndemonstrated that the IgG2 prevailed over IgG1 isotype\nin vaccinated animals for most of the post-vaccination\nintervals analysed (Figure 1). The close relationship\nbetween anti-BoHV-1 VN antibody titres and IgG1 and\nIgG2 antibody levels was demonstrated by the similarity\nof the kinetic curves of these antibodies (Figure 1).\nVirus-neutralizing antibodies reached maximum\nconcentration at 32DPV, whereas specific anti-virus\nantibodies of IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes showed the\nh i gh est concen tr a t ion  at  46DPV (Fi gur e 1).\nNevertheless, there were no significant differences\nbetween concentrations of neutralizing antibodies at\n32 and 46 DPV (P>0.05). Thus, the highest levels of\nanti-BoHV-1 antibodies of IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes\ncoincided with the peak of neutralizing antibody\nactivity. In addition to this, positive correlation\ncoefficients were also found for VN antibody titres and\nIgG1 or IgG2 antibody levels, corresponding to r=0.865,\nand r=0.779, respectively. IgG2 was also the prevailing\nantibody in nasal secretions of vaccinated animals. This\nisotype peaked between 32-46DPV, as well as relatively\nhigh levels of this immunoglobulin (S/P  0.5) were\ndetected in most of the time points investigated (25,\n60, 86, and 114DPV), as occurred with the systemic\na n ti bodi es of t h i s isot ype.  In  con t ra st ,  IgG1\nantibodies appeared in detectable and significant\namounts (S/P    0.5) only at 32 and 46DPV (Figure 2). A\npositive correlation between nasal and circulating IgG1\nand IgG2 antibody levels was also found (r=0.66 and\n0.866, for IgG1 and IgG2, respectively, P<0.001),\nsuggesting that there was, at least, a partial transference\nof these antibodies from systemic to the local\ncompartment, especially for IgG2 antibodies.\n\n The IgG2 isotype showed similar kinetic\nprofiles with regard to those found in serum from of\nantibody-free calves experimentally infected with\nBoHV-1 (MADIC et al., 1995). Moreover, the levels of\nanti-BoHV-1 systemic IgG2 antibodies compared to\nIgG1 isotype remained higher. These results differ from\nMADIC et al. (1995) where IgG1 isotype prevailed over\nIgG2. However, the reason for the prevalence of IgG2\nantibodies is unclear, since the regulation of the immune\nr esponse for  th e pr oduct i on  of a  specifi c\n\n\n\n311Systemic and local antibodies induced by an experimental inactivated vaccine against bovine herpesvirus type 1.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.41, n.2, fev, 2011.\n\nimmunoglobulin isotype is a complex process\ndependent upon many factors and several parameters\nmay influence the formation of immunoglobulin\nisotypes, such as the macromolecular form of the\nimmunogen, type of antigen, and the adjuvant used,\nas demonstrated in the experimental immunization of\nca lves a ga in st  foot-a n d-m outh  disea se vir us\n(MULCAHY et al., 1990).\n\nThe protective capacity of each antibody\nisotype may be interpreted according to its biological\nactivity and, consequently, to its capacity to interact\nwith various immune effector cells or humoral factors,\nas well as the role of these cells in conferring protection\nagainst the pathogen (MULCAHY et al., 1990).\nRegarding the immune-protection against BoHV-1,\nantibodies of isotype IgG2 display greater opsonizing\nactivity than those of isotype IgG1 for bovine\nneutrophils present in peripheral blood (HOWARD et\nal., 1980; PETERS et al., 2004), thus indicating that there\nis greater affinity of the receptors of these cells for\nIgG2 antibodies. On the other hand, antibodies of\nisotype IgG1 are able to efficiently mediate the\nphagocytosis process in bovines by mononuclear\nph agocytes such as m acr opha ges, ra ther th an\nneutrophils, because these cells express higher\nnumbers of receptors or greater affinity of their\nreceptors for the IgG1 Fc region (HOWARD et al., 1980;\nMULCAHY et al., 1990). Considering that ADCC\nconstitutes one of the main mechanisms involved in\nimmunity to BoHV-1, and neutrophils are the cells more\ndirectly involved in this process (BABIUK et al., 1996),\nit was suggested that antibodies of IgG2 isotype\ninduced by the inactivated experimental BoHV-1\n\nvaccine in the current study may play an important\nrole in immunity against this virus.\n\nThe correlation between concentrations of\nanti-BoHV-1 IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies in serum and\nnasal secretion is not an unexpected result, since it has\nbeen demonstrated that the intramuscular administration\nof a subunit vaccine consisting of BoHV-1 glycoproteins\nis capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in the\nnasal mucosa of immunized bovines (BABIUK et al.,\n1987).  Fur th er mor e, t h e va cci n at ed a n i ma l s\ndemonstrated the protection against replication of the\nviral pathogen associated with neutralizing antibody\ntitres in the nasal secretion, and these local antibodies,\nin turn, showed a high level of correlation with serum\nantibody titres (BABIUK et al., 1987). Therefore this\nfin di ng support s th e hypoth esis of select ive\ntransportation of IgG2 isotype from serum to the nasal\nmucosa, and indicates that the concentration of such\nanti-BoHV-1 antibodies in the mucosa, at least in part,\ndepends upon specific anti-BoHV-1 antibodies present\nin serum (BABIUK et al., 1987).\n\nSystemic and local IgG1 and IgG2 anti-\nBoHV-1 a n ti body r esponses i n duced by th e\nadministration of an experimental inactivated vaccine\nwere well characterized in the current investigation,\nbut the functions of different antibody isotypes in\ncattle, relative to the specific mechanisms of protection\nagainst BoHV-1, need further investigation. Inactivated\nvaccines, particularly those containing aluminium\nhydroxide adjuvant, may not be expected to result in a\nsignificant cell-mediated immunity or an extensive\nproduction of IgA antibodies in the mucosa (McGHEE\net al., 1992; GUPTA, 1998). Conversely, the aluminium\n\nFigure 2 - Kinetics of IgG1 and IgG2 specific anti-BoHV-1 antibody levels (S/P\nvalu es, in indirect ELISA) in nasal secretion samples of BoHV-1\nvaccinated and revaccinated animals.\n\n\n\n312 Cilento et al.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.41, n.2, fev, 2011.\n\nhydroxide does stimulate the production of neutralizing\nIgG antibodies, particularly from IgG2 isotype, as\ndemonstrated here, and they are distributed in blood\nand in the nasal secretion and may thus block BoHV-1\nreplication at the initial infection site, as proposed\nbefore (ZHU &amp; LETCHWORTH, 1996). However, an\nimportant point to be emphasized is the brief half-life\nof such antibodies in the nasal secretion (Figure 2),\nmaking local antibody levels decrease shortly after\nrevaccination.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSystemic and local anti-BoHV-1 antibody\nr espon ses wer e i n duced by th e experi m ent a l\ninactivated vaccine in the current study. Neutralizing\nanti-BoHV-1 antibodies were achieved in potentially\nprotective titres until 86 DPV and IgG1 and IgG2\nantibody responses were induced after the second\nvaccination in the serum and in nasal secretions up to\n114 days post vaccination. IgG2 antibodies were the\nprevalent isotype for most of the post-vaccination\nperiod. Despite  not evaluated in the context of\nprotection against experimental infection, the vaccine-\ninduced antibodies can be used as markers for\nmonitoring the effect of the immunization against this\nvirus in cattle, as well as the presence of anti-BoHV-1\nIgG1 and IgG2 antibodies in serum and nasal secretion\nfrom bovines immunized with inactivated vaccines.
