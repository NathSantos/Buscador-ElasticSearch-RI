The animals \nwere distributed into two groups, one for each type of adhesive. From each group, six subgroups were \nhistopathologically evaluated on the 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, 30th, and 60th day post-operative. General (daily) \nand ophthalmic (days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 30, 44, and 60) evaluations clinically indicated that there were \nsignificant differences for the variables water intake, attitude, blepharitis, corneal edema, and fluorescein \ntest. The adhesive permanence time for octyl-cyanoacrylate (17.22 days) was greater than that for ethyl-\ncyanoacrylate (7.66 days). With respect to the histopathological evaluation, corneal epithelization and \ncollagen organization occurred without severe complications. However, treatment with ethyl-\ncyanoacrylate led to a moderate inflammatory reaction in the initial phases. With octyl-cyanoacrylate, re-\nepithelization and collagen organization proceeded more slowly with a discrete inflammatory reaction in \nthe initial phases. From clinical and histopathologic points of view, octyl-cyanoacrylate showed \nadvantages over ethyl-cyanoacrylate, whereas wound healing was achieved in both groups without major \ncomplications.  \n \nKeywords: rabbit, cornea, cyanoacrylate \n \n\nRESUMO \n \nComparou-se o uso do etil-cianoacrilato e do octil-cianoacrilato em c\u00f3rneas de 36 coelhos ap\u00f3s \nceratectomia lamelar (di\u00e2metro e profundidade padronizados).

Deep \nulcerations and traumatic perforations are among \nthe illnesses of greatest morbidity that affects it.  \n \nBecause of the need for sophisticated equipment, \nhighly capable professionals, and training in \nmicro-surgery, the use of classical techniques in \nkeratoplasty is limited to specialized centers. \nTherefore, the study and development of new \nprocedures that are simple, effective, and easy to \nperform are daily challenges.  \n \nAdhesive tissues, tested since the 1960s, are \ndefined as polymerizeable substances with the \ncapacity to keep tissues together or to cause a \nbarrier against extravasation. These are materials \nthat have undergone development and currently \noffer biocompatibility and efficacy (Reece et al., \n2001). Such desirable characteristics are notably: \nprovide local action for the period necessary for \ntheir effective function; degrade without the \nproduction of fragments; adhere to surfaces at \nbody temperature; create a strong, flexible bridge \nbetween tissues; tolerate moisture; and have the \ncapacity to spread out (Donkerwolke et al., 1998; \nReece et al., 2001).  \n \nCyanoacrylates belong to a group of materials \nderived from cyanoacrylic acid. Their liquid \nmonomers solidify by polymerization after \ncontact with a weak base released by a little heat \n(Watte et al., 2004). It is known that the \nbiocompatibility of cyanoacrylates is strongly \nrelated to the number of carbons present in its \nside chain, and that the longer it is, the less tissue \nreaction will be expected (Woodward et al., \n1965; Pani et al., 1968; Dellevigne et al., 1971; \nVote and Elder, 2000).  \n \nGreater tissue reaction after subcutaneous \nimplantation of short-chain cyanoacrylates was \ndue to the release of toxic substances resulting \nfrom their degradation, notably cyanoacetate and \nformaldehyde. Difference related to tissue \nvascularization, variable among tissues, also \nequally contributes to the occurrence of such \nevents (Trott, 1997). \n \nInfiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils after \nthe application of cyanoacrylates has been \n\nreported in different tissues like muscle \n(Woodward et al., 1965), subcutaneous (Pani, et \nal., 1968), and equine intestine (Duarte et al., \n2007). The occurrence of severe infiltrate \ninflammation was also reported by Laus et al. \n(1993) when using a gel adhesive in healthy \ncorneas of dogs.  \n \nIn human ophthalmology, there are reports \ndescribing the application of cyanoacrylates in \npractice, with satisfactory results (Boruchoff et \nal., 1969; Hirst et al., 1982; Taravella and Chang, \n2001; Setlik et al., 2005). However, in veterinary \nophthalmology, the lack of technical knowledge \nof these products, the little experience with \nregard to their manipulation, and the costs \ninvolved have limited their utilization.  \n \nThe aim of this study was to compare the clinical \nand histopathological results between ethyl-\ncyanoacrylate and octyl-cyanoacrylate when \napplied in lamellar keratectomy in rabbits. \n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n \nThirty-six adult male New Zealand rabbits were \nused. They were 120-day-old and averaged 3kg \nb.w. The study rigorously followed the bioethical \nguidelines of the Association for Research in \nVision and Ophthalmology. After a clinical and \nophthalmic examination based on Shirmer\u2019s \nlacrimal test,1 slit-lamp biomicroscopy2, and the \nfluorescein test3, the animals were kept in \nindividual cages, in a ventilated environment that \nwas clean and dry, where they were fed on \ncommercial ration4 and water ad libitum.  \n \nThe adhesives were evaluated in the right eye of \nthe animals, separated into the ethyl-\ncyanoacrylate5 and octyl-cyanoacrylate6 groups. \nThe rabbits from both groups were evenly \nmatched and randomly distributed into six \nsubgroups of three animals, for different \nintervals for evaluation of the corneas, after the \napplication of the adhesives. \n \n\n                                                 \n1Schirmer\u2019s test - Ophthalmos, Brazil. \n2Slit Lamp SL-14 - Kowa Company, USA. \n3Fluorescein strips - Ophthalmos, Brazil. \n4Nutricoelho\u00ae - Purina, Brazil. \n5Super Bonder\u00ae - Loctite, 3M, Brazil. \n6Dermabond\u00ae - Johnson &amp; Johnson, USA. \n\n\n\nEffects of ethyl-cyanoacrylate\u2026 \n\nArq.

It was maintained \nby inhalational halothane9, supplied with face \nmask, in a semi-closed circuit. Immediately \nbefore lamellar keratectomy, two drops of \ntetracaine anesthetic with 0.1% phenylephrine \nwere instilled10.  \n \nThe surgical procedures were carried out using a \nsurgical microscope11, at 10 times magnification. \nAfter routine antiseptic measures, protection of \nthe operating field, blepharostasis, and fixation \nof the eyeball; a lamellar button was created by \n3mm in diameter trepanning12, composed of \nepithelium and about half the thickness of the \nstroma in the central region of the cornea. It was \nexcised with an angled scalpel13 and in its place, \none of the two adhesives was deposited using a \nsyringe14 with a hypodermic needle15. The area \nwas then covered with a 3mm diameter cellulose \nsterile film16, for the purpose of creating a \nsmooth surface over the lesion. \n \nIn the postoperative period, 0.3% tobramycin17 \nwas instilled every 6h for 10 days and systemic \nanalgesia was subcutaneously administered with \nbuprenorphine18, at a dose of 0.02mg/kg, at \nintervals of 12 hours, for five consecutive days. \nThe animals were fitted with an Elisabethan \ncollar. \n \nIn the postoperative period, ophthalmic \nevaluations were performed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, \n10, 14, 21, 30, 45, and 60, at night, and consisted \nof Shirmer\u2019s lacrimal test, determination of the \ndegree of blepharospasm, ocular discharge, \nconjunctival hyperemia and chemosis, and \nfluorescein test.

In addition, in the first 10 days of the \npostoperative period, on a daily basis and in the \nmorning, the animals were observed for \nbehavior, and food and water consumption. \nRetention of the adhesives on the cornea was \ndaily evaluated in the morning. Scores were used \nfor data compilation and statistical study with \nregard to each evaluated event (Table 1). \n \nAt the end of the each histopathological study \nperiod, the animals were sacrificed with letal \ndose of barbiturate19 (100mg/kg) intravenously \napplied. Subconjunctival enucleation was \nperformed and the eyes were kept in modified \nKarnovsky fixative for histological examination. \nThe used stains were hematoxylin-eosin and \nMasson\u2019s trichrome. The preparations were \nanalyzed and the most important events \ndocumented by photomicroscopy20. \n \nThe experimental design was based on the \nfactorial arrangement of two treatments x six \nperiods with three repetitions (36 animals). The \ndata for the different studied parameters were \nexamined by analysis of variance and the means \nwere compared by a t-test, at 5% level of \nsignificance, utilizing generalized linear models \nand chi-squared test on Statistical Analysis \nSystem.  \n \n\nRESULTS \n \nTable 2 presents the means determined for the \nvariables behavior, and food and water \nconsumption for the two treatments.

About the clinical \npostoperative evaluation, there was a significant \nincrease on the first day for all the variables, with \na tendency for their normalization in the course \nof the postoperative period and return to baseline \nvalues by day 45. Ocular discharge, \npredominantly of the mucoid and/or seromucoid \ntype, was observed in all the animals, with the \ngreatest intensity on days one and three \npostoperative.  \n \nCorneal edema was peri-lesional and discrete. \nThis was seen on the first day postoperative in \n61% of the rabbits that received ethyl-\ncyanoacrylate. At three days, 11% of the animals \nof this group still manifested edema.  In those \nthat received octyl-cyanoacrylate, corneal edema \nwas found in only 16% of the animals in the first \nday postoperative. At the fifth day postoperative, \nno more edema was observed in animal from \nboth groups. \n \nUveitis occurred in animals from both groups \nand it was considered discrete when there was \nobserved just iris hyperemia. When this signal \n\nwas accomplished with edema and miosis, the \nuveitis was considered moderate. There was no \nsignificant difference in mean frequency of \nanterior uveitis between treatments with octyl-\ncyanoacrylate (m = 0.75) and ethyl-\ncyanoacrylate (m = 0.76). \n \nThe fluorescein test was positive in 61% of the \nanimals of the ethyl-cyanoacrylate group on day \none, 3% on day three, 2% on days five and \nseven, and 11% on day 10. With regard to octyl-\ncyanoacrylate, 33% of the animals showed a \npositive result on the first day postoperative and \n5% on the second. There was a significant \ndifference in the mean frequency of positive \nfluorescein test between the octyl-cyanoacrylate \n(m = 0.72) and ethyl-cyanoacrylate groups (m = \n0.79) (P<0.05).  \n \nThe estimated means (for all the periods) for \nretention time of the adhesive on the cornea were \n17.22 days for the octyl-cyanoacrylate group and \n7.66 days for the ethyl-cyanoacrylate group. \nThere was a significant difference between the \ntwo treatments (P<0.05).

Treatment with \noctyl-cyanoacrylate showed a fractured space, \nwhich was filled by adhesive, appeared \ntransparent, with protuberances and recesses at \nthe stromal edges, suggesting possible \npenetration of the biomaterial. Scarce exudate \nrested on an acellular layer that covered the \nbiomaterial. A reduced area of stromal edema \nwas demonstrated on the adhesive (Fig. 2). \n \nAt seve days postoperative, animals from both \ngroups exhibited hyperplasia and hypertrophy of \nthe germinative cells of the epithelium on the \nedges of the lesion, which had migrated over the \nlesioned stroma. In the animals from ethyl-\ncyanoacrylate group, there was a mixed \ninflammatory infiltrate represented by \npolymorphonuclear (neutrophils) and phagocytic \nmononuclear cells. At 14 days postoperative, the \ncorneas of the animals from ethyl-cyanoacrylate \ngroup showed complete re-epithelization, while \nthe stroma, still disorganized, was permeated by \nvarious keratocytes and the neo-epithelium still \ndisplayed cellular hyperplasia (Fig. 3). \n\nAttenuation of hyperplasia and organization of \ncollagen fibers were gradually seen in \nsubsequent evaluations (21 and 30 days \npostoperative). In the animals from octyl-\ncyanoacrylate group, at 14, 21, and 30 days, \nthere was a slow migration of hyperplastic \nepithelial cells and moderate number of \ninflammatory cells (neutrophils), intact and in a \nstate of degeneration, on the detached portions of \nthe adhesive. The stroma, despite remaining \nrelatively organized, showed a discrete \nconcentration of keratocytes in the portions \nimmediately subjacent to the adhesive (Fig. 4). \nBy the 60th day postoperative, the animals from \nboth groups showed complete re-epithelization \nand organized stroma (Fig. 5).  \n \n\nDISCUSSION \n \nThe evaluations relative to food and water \nconsumption and behavior were devised for the \npurpose of identifying some indication of ocular \npain, since the cornea has nociceptive \ninnervation on its surface. According to Johnston \n(2005), the ingestion of food and water, and \nconsequently body weight, tend to decrease \nnotably in cases of pain. Regarding water \nconsumption and behavior, it can suggest that \noctyl-cyanoacrylate induced less discomfort. \n \n\n  \n \n \n \n\n\n\nBarbosa et al. \n\nArq. Bras. Med. Vet.

The result is similar to \nthat reported by Abrams et al. (1990), who \nevaluated 142 healthy rabbits and obtained a \nmean of 5.32.96. The increase observed in both \ntreatments which did not significantly differ, is \nbelieved to be due to conjunctival and corneal \nirritation after the surgery procedure.  \n \nAbout blepharospasm, ocular discharge, \nhyperemia, and chemosis, the findings were \nsimilar to those of Ollivier et al. (2001), who \ntested butyl-cyanoacrylate in rabbit corneas and \nshowed a significant increase on the first day \npostoperative, with gradual decline to levels not \nsignificantly different than baseline levels. \nAccording to these authors, the tendency toward \n\nnormalization is due to the fact that the surface \nover the adhesive becomes less irregular with \ntime, causing less discomfort. Using butyl-\ncyanoacrylate in dogs, Bromberg (2002) and \nWatte et al. (2004) observed discrete \nblepharospasm which disappeared over a course \nof two to three days. In human patients, \nprotection with a contact lens reduced the \noccurrence of such symptoms (Taravella and \nChang, 2001; Feldberg et al., 2003; Setlik, 2005). \n \nPeri-lesional corneal edema was observed on the \nfirst day postoperative in 61% of the animals \ntreated with ethyl-cyanoacrylate and in 10% of \nthose who received octyl-cyanoacrylate. These \nobservations suggest that octyl-cyanoacrylate \nproduced a better impermeabilization of the \n\n\n\nBarbosa et al. \n\nArq. Bras. Med. Vet. Zootec., v.61, n.5, p.1067-1076, 2009 1074 \n\ncornea in the lesioned areas.  Mota et al. (2004) \nshowed less occurrence of edema in lesions \ntreated with butyl-cyanoacrylate compared to the \nsutured cornea. According to the authors, the \nadhesive provided better apposition between the \nedges of the lesion, impermeabilizing it and \naiding in stromal re-organization.  \n \nFeldberg et al. (2003) studied ethyl-\ncyanoacrylate in 22 human patients, to whom a \nsecond application was needed in 50% of the \ncases. This group found a significant difference \nbetween treatments in the fluorescein test. Such a \nfinding, together with corneal edema, indicated \nthat octyl-cyanoacrylate provided better \nplasticity and adherence to the tissue receptor. \n \nThe uveitis identified in both groups, did not \nshow significant differences and was a reflex \nresponse to corneal irritation. Gasset et al. (1970) \ndemonstrated minor iritis after intracorneal \napplication of butyl-cyanoacrylate in rabbits.  In \nhumans, the utilization of therapeutic contact \nlenses in the postoperative period has been \nshown to minimize mechanical irritation and \nconsequently reflex uveitis. \n \nWith respect to the mechanical function of \nadhesives as a temporary tectonic procedure, \nthere was a difference between the estimated \nmean (which involved all the periods) and the \nobserved mean (simple mean for each individual \nperiod). For the treatment with ethyl-\ncyanoacrylate, the estimated mean retention time \nwas 7.66 days. When considering only the period \nof 60 days, the mean was 11.6 days. This finding \nis in contrast to that of Feldberg al. (2003), who \nfound a variation of three days to five months in \nhumans. The difference among species, size and \ndepth of the lesions, as well as the utilization of \ntherapeutic contact lenses which limit friction by \nthe eyelids on the adhesive could have accounted \nfor the differences.  With regard to octyl-\ncyanoacrylate, the estimated mean was 17.22 \ndays and that observed at 60 days was 32 days. \nBromberg (2002) reported a mean of 247 days in \na study on the use of butyl-cyanoacrylate in the \ntreatment of refractory ulcers in dogs. Watte et \nal. (2004), in conditions of clinical application in \ndogs, found values varying form one week to six \nmonths. Mota et al. (2004) reported no \ndetachment of butyl-cyanoacrylate for up to 30 \ndays of observation in rabbits. \n \n\nTo make use of a corneal adhesive, it is \nnecessary that it remain until tissue repair is \ncomplete. The fact that octyl-cyanoacrylate \nremains on the corneal surface 2.5 times longer \nthan ethyl-cyanoacrylate, together with the \nsignificant difference in fluorescein test, \ndemonstrates the advantages of the octyl-\ncyanoacrylate. \nWith regard to histopathology, the presence of a \nconsiderable amount of exudate, predominantly \nneutrophilic, on the acellular film on the third \nday postoperative in the animals treated with \nethyl-cyanoacrylate, resulted in an acute \ninflammatory response of the conjunctiva, as a \nreflex of corneal irritation. In the group that \nreceived octyl-cyanoacrylate, a very slightly \namount of neutrophilic exudate was found. \nInflammatory infiltrate is a common report when \ncyanoacrylates (Woodward et al., 1965; Pani, et \nal., 1968; Duarte et al., 2007) or other types of \nadhesives were used in tissues (Laus et al., \n1993).  \n \nDifferences were found with respect to the \nappearance and bi-refringence of the adhesives \nby light microscopy. Ethyl-cyanoacrylate \nshowed little advantage due to elevated bi-\nrefringence and blotchy appearance. According \nto Reece et al. (2001), the adhesive should \ndegrade without leaving fragments. Octyl-\ncyanoacrylate expressed minimal bi-refringence \nand showed no fragments. It was found to be \ninterwoven with and fixed to the corneal stroma, \nwith protuberance and recesses. Donkerwolke et \nal. (1998) reported the importance of a strong \nand flexible bridge to allow tissue migration.  \n \nHyperplasia and hypertrophy of the epithelial \ncell layers, in migration, separated the adhesive \nfrom the corneal stroma in both treatments by the \nseventh day postoperative. Similar results were \ndescribed in rabbits by Gasset et al. (1970) and \nMota et al. (2004), after the corneal application \nof cyanoacrylates. For the same period, \ninflammatory infiltrate containing neutrophils \nand some macrophages in the subjacent stromal \nportion was found in the animals that received \nethyl-cyanoacrylate.  \n \nTwo weeks after the application of the adhesives, \nhypertrophy and cellular hyperplasia were \npresent in animals from both groups. In the \ntreatment with ethyl-cyanoacrylate, re-\nepithelization of the lesion was evident. The \n\n\n\nEffects of ethyl-cyanoacrylate\u2026 \n\nArq. Bras. Med. Vet. Zootec., v.61, n.5, p.1067-1076, 2009 1075\n\nsubjacent stroma showed intense fibroplasia and \nsubstantial disorganization. In animals from \noctyl-cyanoacrylate group, hyperplasia and \nhypertrophy were observed with epithelial \nmigration of considerably less intensity. There \nwas organization of the stromal collagen fibers \nwhich were found to be permeated by new \nkeratocytes. These findings are similar to those \nreported by Vote and Elder (2000) describing the \nslow degradation of octyl-cyanoacrylate.  \n \nHistopathological changes at 21 and 30 days \npostoperative for ethyl-cyanoacrylate included \nstromal organization with a gradual decrease in \nintensity of epithelial hyperplasia and \nhypertrophy, and keratocytes infiltrating the \nstroma undergoing repair. In the group of  \nanimals that received octyl-cyanoacrylate, at 21 \nand 30 days postoperative, the observation of \ninflammatory cells, intact and undergoing \ndegeneration at the interface between adhesive \nand tissue, already noted, and of the re-structured \nepithelium, emphasizes the necessity of \nmonitoring individuals who are treated with slow \ndegrading cyanoacrylates, in light of the \npossibility of development of infections. Such \nreservations were also noted by Gasset et al. \n(1970), Vote and Elder (2000), and Bromberg \n(2002).  \n \nAt 60 days postoperative, corneal re-structuring \nwas seen in both groups, without differences \nwith respect to cellular pattern. Gasset et al. \n(1970) and Ollivier et al. (2001) reported similar \nfindings in experimental studies of \ncyanoacrylates. \n \n\nCONCLUSION \n \nIt is concluded that octyl-cyanoacrylate is more \nadvantageous than ethyl-cyanoacrylate in the \nrepair of lesioned corneas, whereas both \nadhesives showed final satisfactory results when \nperformed with the objective of an emergency \ntectonic coverage for this clinical situation. \n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nThe authors thank the Conselho Nacional de \nDesenvolvimento Cientifico and Tecnologico \n(CNPq) for the financial support and \ncollaborators Marco Augusto Giannoccaro da \nSilva, Bianca da Costa Martins, Alexandre Pinto \nRibeiro, Ana Leticia de Souza, and Vera Cippoli \n\nMusci for their help during the course of this \nwork.
