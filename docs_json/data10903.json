In order \n\nto accomplish this, malacological surveys were conducted at the selected localities between \n\nMay and December 2016, in order to identify and georeference the breeding sites and foci of \n\nschistosomiasis-transmitting mollusks of the genus Biomphalaria. The essential abiotic data for \n\nmollusk survival were evaluated at each breeding site: temperature, water pH and total \n\ndissolved solids (TDS). Data relating to breeding site quality were also recorded. The SPSS 20 \n\nsoftware was used to analyze these data, and the chi-square test was applied to investigate \n\nassociations between variables, taking a p-value ? 0.5. Based on geographic coordinates, maps \n\nrepresenting the distribution of breeding sites and foci, mollusk species found and numbers of \n\nmollusks sampled in each water body were created. ArcGIS 10.4 software was used to build \nthematic maps using the interpolation technique of inverse distance weighting (IDW). A total \n\nof 72 localities distributed among 44 municipalities located in the Metropolitan, Zona da Mata \n\nand Agreste regions of Pernambuco were investigated. At these, 26 reservoirs, 32 breeding sites \n\nand 10 foci of schistosomiasis intermediate hosts were found.

INTRODUCTION \n\nEcological tourism attracts nature lovers who choose leisure activities related to nature that \n\noffer accommodations and additional services. The Travelers\u2019 Health Guidelines studied \n\npeople\u2019s movements and their interactions with various environments, in order to identify the \n\nrisks to which tourists are exposed so that the tourists\u2019 health may be protected during their \n\ntravels. Pre-trip vaccination is among the recommendations for tourists who come to Brazil. \n\nThere are websites that provide information about preventive actions that aim to protect \n\ntravelers and reduce the risk of epidemics (Brasil, 2005). However, movement of people is not \n\nan activity that is limited to tourism: it also includes migrant or refugee groups. Moreover, it \n\nmust be borne in mind that, for some diseases, there is still no specific vaccination.  \n\nLocally, weekend recreational activities and second-home refuges need to be taken into \n\naccount. The populations involved in such activities live close to natural tourist resources and \n\nare more exposed to unhealthy environments than are travelers who are just passing through. \n\nThe Travelers\u2019 Health Guidelines need to acknowledge this diversity and healthcare services \n\nneed to expand their differentiated action strategies in order to meet this challenge (Matos e \n\nBarcellos, 2010). \n\nThe state of Pernambuco presents a mild climate throughout the year and has a large \n\nnetwork of natural water accumulations consisting of rivers and waterfalls that are attractive for \n\nwater-related leisure activities. In this context, rural and coastal accommodation structures, \n\ninns, fish-and-pay establishments, resorts and travel agencies offer countless options for \n\nfreshwater sports or leisure activities. Farm owners and urban entrepreneurs have been \n\nencouraged to diversify their activities through investing in structures for this type of recreation \n\nwithout proper attention to basic sanitation infrastructure that would provide health safety for \n\nfreshwater leisure activities. Growth of the tourism industry contributes to the economic and \n\nsocial development of the state by attracting visitors. However, landscapes with natural water \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n3 \nInsalubrious touristic environments and schistosomiasis transmission \u2026 \n\nRev. Ambient. \u00c1gua vol. 13 n. 3, e2151 - Taubat\u00e9 2018 \n\n \n\nresources are becoming modified, and this is leading to serious damage to the environment \n\n(Ag\u00eancia Nacional de \u00c1guas, 2005). \n\nManson\u2019s schistosomiasis is a waterborne disease for which the etiological agent is the \n\nparasite Schistosoma mansoni. Its intermediate hosts are freshwater snails belonging to the \n\ngenus Biomphalaria When parasitized individuals dispose of their feces, which includes the \n\nparasite\u2019s eggs, in water collection systems inhabited by these snails, these animals become \n\ninfected with the Schistosoma miracidium and start transmitting the disease to other people who \n\ncome into contact with these polluted waters. \n\nIn Pernambuco, schistosomiasis started as an endemic disease in the rural area of the Zona \n\nda Mata region, and now the foci are spread throughout the coast. It causes high rates of human \n\ninfection, maintenance of acute and severe clinical forms and a significant number of deaths \n\n(Barbosa et al., 2016). A recent survey indicated 119 localities in Pernambuco where over 15% \n\nof the population is parasitized and 97.5% of houses do not have sewage collection or treatment. \n\nThis exposes 152,865 people to the risk of infection by S. mansoni (Saucha et al., 2015).  \n\nPoor sanitation conditions at localities that are endemic for schistosomiasis contribute to \n\nthe spread of cases, with severe illness and deaths due to this disease. The relationship between \n\nthe environment and lack of basic sanitation determines occurrences of waterborne diseases. \n\nSocial groups that live in areas that lack sanitation services are subject to potentially greater \n\nadverse effects to their own health if they pollute freshwater accumulations where disease \n\nvectors proliferate.  \n\nSewage discharge into rivers, ponds and peridomestic ditches creates unhealthy \n\nenvironments that favor transmission of parasitic diseases. Examples of this include the severe \n\nschistosomiasis outbreaks that occurred in the metropolitan areas of Belo Horizonte, Minas \n\nGerais, Recife, Pernambuco (Barbosa et al., 2011) and Aracaju, Sergipe (de Jesus et al., 2002), \n\nand in the interior of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Recently, in the Chapada Diamantina region \n\n(Bahia), 32 tourists became infected after swimming in a local pond. Thus, in resorts and parks, \n\ntravelers become susceptible to this parasitic disease when exposed to water contaminated with \n\nfecal material. \n\nThe term \u201cenvironmental risk\u201d refers to situations that present a risk relating to what \n\nsurrounds the individual, which may be the natural environment (natural risk) or a man-made \n\nenvironment (social and technological risk) resulting from human actions and occupation of \n\nterritory (Dagnino e Carpi, 2007). \n\nTravelers who are exposed to this environmental risk and who become infected by S. \n\nmansoni develop the acute form of the disease, if there has been no previous contact between \n\nthe individual and this parasite. However, the acute infection is self-limited and so these \n\ntravelers may return home without presenting typical signs of infection. Timely treatment of \n\nthe disease is thus delayed, which contributes towards its spread into disease-free areas, given \n\nthat travelers move between endemic and non-endemic areas (Barreto et al., 2016).  \n\nThis study sought to identify and spatialize the risk of transmission of Manson\u2019s \n\nschistosomiasis at localities in Pernambuco that are inhabited by the snail that transmits this \n\ndisease and that have freshwater environments used for tourism. \n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nLocalities in municipalities in the Agreste and Zona da Mata regions and in the \n\nMetropolitan Region of Recife were selected using the Rural Tourism Guidelines of \n\nPernambuco and accommodation websites for this state.  \n\nMalacological surveys were conducted at these selected localities between May and \n\nDecember 2016 and were made with appropriate tools, like forceps, according to the depth of \n\nthe water collection, following the method developed by Olivier and Schneiderman (1956), in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRev. Ambient. \u00c1gua vol. 13 n. 3, e2151 - Taubat\u00e9 2018 \n\n \n\n4 Constan\u00e7a Sim\u00f5es Barbosa et al. \n\norder to identify and georeference (using the Garmin eTrex\u00ae 20 GPS) breeding sites (reservoirs \n\nwith intermediate host snails) of Biomphalaria and foci (breeding sites with infected mollusks) \n\nof schistosomiasis transmission. Intermediate hosts were sampled and sent to the \n\nSchistosomiasis Laboratory and Reference Service of Aggeu Magalh\u00e3es Institute - Fiocruz, in \n\norder to identify the species and detect infectivity due to S. mansoni, using the traditional light \n\nexposure technique (Kuntz, 1946) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is sensitive \n\nand specific for diagnosing low loads of parasitic infection (Melo et al., 2006).  \n\nThe essential abiotic data for mollusk survival were evaluated at each breeding site: \n\ntemperature, water pH and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured in loco with a digital \nspit thermometer, digital pH meter and digital TDS meter, respectively. Data relating to \n\nbreeding site quality were also recorded: natural or artificial water accumulation, presence of \n\nsewage, presence of vegetation cover, water transparency and the sediment composition. \n\nBreeding sites were classified as natural (pond, river or waterfall) or artificial (natural pools or \n\nfish-and-pay ponds). The SPSS 20 software was used to analyze these data, and the chi-square \n\ntest was applied to investigate associations between variables, taking the p-value ? 0.5. \n\nBased on geographic coordinates, maps representing the distribution of breeding sites and \n\nfoci of transmission, mollusk species found and numbers of mollusks sampled in each water \n\naccumulation were created. The ArcGIS 10.4 software was used to build thematic maps using \n\nthe interpolation technique of inverse distance weighting (IDW). The IDW interpolator \n\ndetermines values for unknown areas by calculating the weighted mean using the inverse of the \n\ndistance between this area and a point where the value is known (Harman et al., 2016). The \n\nEquation 1 to determine the values of interpolation areas is described by the following formula: \n\n?0 =\n? =1 ?? . ??\n?\n?\n\n? =1?? ??\n                 (1) \n\nWhere: \n\n n represents the number of known points;  \n\nNi is the interpolation value at position i;  \n\nand Pi is the weight of each interpolation value at position i. \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nA total of 72 localities distributed among 44 municipalities located in the Metropolitan, \n\nZona da Mata and Agreste regions of Pernambuco were investigated. At these, 26 reservoirs, 32 \n\nbreeding sites of intermediate hosts and 10 foci of schistosomiasis transmission were found. The \n\ncorrelation analysis (Pearson and Spearman coefficients) and chi-square and Fisher tests did not \n\nshow any statistically significant differences in presence of schistosomiasis intermediate hosts \n\nin relation to the variables of each breeding site environment (Table 1). \n\nFigure 1 shows the geographic distribution of breeding sites and species of schistosomiasis \n\nintermediate hosts at leisure localities. At 36 breeding sites, the species was Biomphalaria \n\nstraminea and at 6 sites it was B. glabrata. The breeding sites for B. straminea at which presence \n\nof S. mansoni DNA was diagnosed by means of PCR were considered to be potential foci (6 \n\nbreeding sites were positive). At 4 breeding sites where B. glabrata was found, snails were found \n\nto be releasing infecting cercariae. Therefore, these can be considered to be active transmission \n\nfoci for schistosomiasis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n5 \nInsalubrious touristic environments and schistosomiasis transmission \u2026 \n\nRev.

Numbers of specimens sampled from breeding sites of intermediate hosts and foci of \n\nschistosomiasis transmission identified at water-activity leisure localities in Pernambuco. \n\nFigure 3 shows that the results regarding the physical-chemical conditions of the water \n\naccumulations were very similar, both for breeding sites and for reservoirs, thus indicating that \n\nthese reservoirs were susceptible to colonization by schistosomiasis intermediate hosts. \n\nThe data that resulted from the present study made it possible to construct thematic maps \n\nthat indicated schistosomiasis transmission risk areas in touristic water-activity leisure localities \n\nin Pernambuco that are breeding sites for schistosomiasis-transmitting snails. These breeding \n\nsites become transmission foci for the disease in the absence of local sanitation systems, which \n\nleads to fecal pollution of freshwater bodies and favors waterborne diseases, thus threatening the \n\nhealth of tourist populations engaged in aquatic recreational activities in Pernambuco. \n\nThe fact that no association regarding specific ecological conditions that favored or \n\ndifferentiated breeding sites from reservoirs was found indicated that the aquatic environments \n\nstudied presented the same favorable characteristics and conditions for the intermediate hosts\u2019 \n\nsurvival, and that they were able to quickly transform into breeding sites and/or foci. Spatial \n\nanalysis using the IDW estimator was an important epidemiological tool, complementary to the \n\nstatistical analysis of this study. It showed, in map form, that reservoirs, breeding sites of \n\nintermediate hosts and foci of schistosomiasis transmission, are found under similar physical-\n\nchemical conditions. This facilitates intermediate host colonization and enables the spread of \n\ndisease. The spatial distribution and numbers of mollusks sampled showed the spot intensity of \n\nthe disease and the occurrence of each event. This makes it possible to undertake situational \n\nanalyses in the future, in order to predict the epidemiological and spatial dimensions of the \n\ndisease in the study area. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRev.

These represent situations of active transmission of the disease at coastal \n\nlocalities such as Itamarac\u00e1, Serrambi, Porto de Galinhas and Carne de Vaca, which are \n\nimportant resorts in Pernambuco, visited by tourists and local vacationers throughout the year. \n\nIn these coastal areas, there are no natural water accumulations and transmission of \n\nschistosomiasis is seasonal, governed by the rainy season (May to August). During this period, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n9 \nInsalubrious touristic environments and schistosomiasis transmission \u2026 \n\nRev.

These artificial and \n\nperidomestic foci are formed by wastewater that is discharged into the environment, in \n\ncommunities that dwell in areas surrounding the resorts (Barbosa et al., 2015a; 2015b). \n\nWhen tourists disembark in Recife, they receive an information leaflet on \u201cRural Routes in \n\nPernambuco\u201d, which indicates localities with freshwater leisure attractions that are located in \n\nareas that are endemic for schistosomiasis. Considering that these localities receive visitors \n\nthroughout the year, information needs to be provided for them regarding the risks that they may \n\nbe exposed to when visiting water bodies at localities with foci of schistosomiasis transmission, \n\nand the risk that they run of becoming agents that disseminate parasitic diseases into non-\n\nendemic areas. Travelers\u2019 health precautions should be based on a set of actions and partnerships \n\nbetween governments, travel agencies and health surveillance sectors, in order to provide proper \n\nand precise information about the risks present in aquatic leisure environments, with the aim of \n\nprotecting people who visit these areas.  \n\nSome of the problems relating to ecotourism are far from being resolved, such as insistence \n\nthat tourism entrepreneurs should follow the technical norms issued by the Brazilian Association \n\nof Ecotourism and Adventure Tourism Agencies (ABETA) and sanctions for those that do not \n\nconform. This Association has been active throughout Brazil since 2004 and is responsible for \n\nmanagement and implementation of the Safe Adventure Program, in partnership with the \n\nNational Servi\u00e7o Brasileiro de Apoio \u00e0s Micro e Pequenas Empresas (SEBRAE), the Ministry \n\nfor Tourism, and the main Brazilian ecotourism and adventure tourism agencies (Abeta e \n\nMinist\u00e9rio do Turismo, 2009). \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS \n\nAlthough the present study was only descriptive, it precisely identified and located \n\nproblematic localities that are visited by tourist groups that, through exposure to unhealthy \n\nenvironments, are subject to infection by the parasite S. mansoni. Expansion of this knowledge \n\nis necessary in order to evaluate the environmental characteristics responsible for maintenance \n\nof these foci of the disease transmission, and thus to produce more significant conclusions that \n\nmight become effective public healthcare strategies that minimize the impact of transmission of \n\nthis disease among local populations and tourists who come to this state seeking leisure in its \n\nbeautiful landscapes. \n\n5.
