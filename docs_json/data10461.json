Na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica, encontram-se representados por um grande \n\nn\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies end\u00e9micas, a maioria das quais com estatutos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nelevados. Para al\u00e9m das amea\u00e7as inerentes aos ecossistemas fluviais (e.g. polui\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nprolifera\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas e destrui\u00e7\u00e3o de habitats) e do car\u00e1cter intermitente de \n\ngrande parte dos rios da regi\u00e3o, os ciprin\u00eddeos ib\u00e9ricos apresentam, na sua grande \n\nmaioria, popula\u00e7\u00f5es fragmentadas e com reduzida diversidade gen\u00e9tica, o que potencia \n\no seu risco de extin\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n O ruivaco-do-Oeste Achondrostoma occidentale \u00e9 uma das esp\u00e9cies end\u00e9micas \n\nde Portugal que se encontra fortemente amea\u00e7ada. Este pequeno ciprin\u00eddeo apresenta \n\numa distribui\u00e7\u00e3o muito restrita, limitada \u00e0s ribeiras do Alcabrichel, Sizandro e Safarujo, \n\nonde as popula\u00e7\u00f5es j\u00e1 com baixa diversidade gen\u00e9tica enfrentam ainda graves \n\nproblemas de polui\u00e7\u00e3o das \u00e1guas e destrui\u00e7\u00e3o de habitats. \n\nFace \u00e0 situa\u00e7\u00e3o de risco do ruivaco-do-Oeste e ao contexto de seca ocorrido em \n\nPortugal em 2006, iniciou-se em 2007 um programa de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o ex situ desta \n\nesp\u00e9cie. Este programa permitiu at\u00e9 \u00e0 data, a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de sete ac\u00e7\u00f5es de repovoamento \n\ndas popula\u00e7\u00f5es de ruivaco-do-Oeste do Alcabrichel, Sizandro e Safarujo, com a \n\nliberta\u00e7\u00e3o de um total de 6577 indiv\u00edduos. Apesar do sucesso da reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o do ruivaco-\n\ndo-Oeste em cativeiro, a sua ecologia permanece pouco conhecida, sendo evidente a \n\nfalta de informa\u00e7\u00e3o de base sobre a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o e abund\u00e2ncia das popula\u00e7\u00f5es naturais e \n\npar\u00e2metros de hist\u00f3ria de vida, nomeadamente no que se refere aos padr\u00f5es de \n\ncrescimento (tanto das popula\u00e7\u00f5es selvagens como das criadas em cativeiro) e ao \n\ncomportamento reprodutor. O esclarecimento destes v\u00e1rios aspectos reveste-se de \n\nextrema relev\u00e2ncia para definir directrizes para futuras ac\u00e7\u00f5es de repovoamento de \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es selvagens desta esp\u00e9cie. \n\nNeste contexto, e atrav\u00e9s de tr\u00eas abordagens distintas, pretende-se com esta tese: (1) \n\navaliar o uso do habitat e o estado actual das popula\u00e7\u00f5es selvagens, atrav\u00e9s de estimativas \n\nde abund\u00e2ncia relativa e determina\u00e7\u00e3o do comprimento e condi\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica; (2) estudar o \n\ncrescimento das popula\u00e7\u00f5es em cativeiro e compar\u00e1-lo com o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es selvagens; (3) \n\ndescrever o comportamento reprodutor da esp\u00e9cie, usando uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o mantida em \n\ncativeiro em condi\u00e7\u00f5es que recriam o mais fielmente poss\u00edvel o ambiente natural. Com base \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nna an\u00e1lise integrada dos resultados obtidos com esta abordagem multidisciplinar, \n\npretendem-se indicar formas de melhorar a efic\u00e1cia das futuras ac\u00e7\u00f5es de repovoamento a \n\nrealizar no \u00e2mbito do programa de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o ex situ de que esta esp\u00e9cie \u00e9 alvo. \n\n A monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es selvagens foi realizada entre Setembro e Outubro \n\nde 2014, no final da esta\u00e7\u00e3o seca, quando a conectividade das ribeiras Alcabrichel, Sizandro \n\ne Safarujo estava ainda interrompida e os peixes se encontravam confinados em p\u00eagos \n\nisolados, que funcionam como ref\u00fagios estivais e fontes de colonizadores para o sistema na \n\nesta\u00e7\u00e3o h\u00famida.  \n\nAs zonas montante das tr\u00eas ribeiras foram percorridas de carro e mapearam-se os \n\np\u00eagos persistentes. Em cada um dos 14 pegos inventariados quantificaram-se, 15 vari\u00e1veis \n\nde habitat, descritoras da morfologia do p\u00eago (i.e. comprimento, largura e profundidade \n\nm\u00e1ximas, \u00e1rea e volume), ensombramento das galerias rip\u00edcolas, abund\u00e2ncia de macr\u00f3fitas \n\ne de detritos, substrato dominante, heterogeneidade do substrato, temperatura da \u00e1gua, pH e \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de am\u00f3nia, nitritos e nitratos na \u00e1gua. A abund\u00e2ncia relativa de A. occidentale \n\nfoi estimada atrav\u00e9s de pesca el\u00e9ctrica, sendo o tempo de amostragem proporcional ao \n\nvolume do p\u00eago. Foram medidos o comprimento \u00e0 furca e o peso de todos os indiv\u00edduos \n\ncapturados, com vista \u00e0 obten\u00e7\u00e3o de distribui\u00e7\u00f5es de comprimento e determina\u00e7\u00e3o do factor \n\nde condi\u00e7\u00e3o, respectivamente. Para os peixes com mais de 40 mm, foram ainda retiradas \n\ntr\u00eas escamas da terceira fiada de escamas abaixo da barbatana dorsal, para posterior \n\ndetermina\u00e7\u00e3o da idade e taxas de crescimento. Foi tamb\u00e9m verificada a presen\u00e7a, na \n\nbarbatana dorsal, da cicatriz do corte efectuado aos indiv\u00edduos libertados nas ac\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nrepovoamento, para reconhecimento da sua proveni\u00eancia. \n\n Por forma a comparar o crescimento das popula\u00e7\u00f5es selvagens com o das \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es cativas, foram recolhidas escamas em indiv\u00edduos das popula\u00e7\u00f5es mantidas em \n\ncativeiro no Aqu\u00e1rio Vasco da Gama e na Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Aqu\u00edcola de Campelo. \n\nA idade de cada indiv\u00edduo foi determinada atrav\u00e9s da contagem, \u00e0 lupa, das marcas \n\nanuais de crescimento. O comprimento \u00e0 furca em cada idade foi estimado por retroc\u00e1lculo, \n\na partir das rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre o raio total da escama e o comprimento \u00e0 furca, e foram \n\nposteriormente determinados os incrementos anuais de comprimento. \n\n A componente deste trabalho relativa ao estudo do comportamento reprodutor do \n\nruivaco-do-Oeste foi realizada no Aqu\u00e1rio Vasco da Gama, com uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o do Rio \n\nSafarujo fundada em 2011. Ap\u00f3s um per\u00edodo de observa\u00e7\u00e3o informal iniciado em \n\nNovembro de 2014, os primeiros ind\u00edcios de in\u00edcio de actividade reprodutora no tanque \n\nexperimental foram observados no princ\u00edpio de Abril de 2015, tendo-se ent\u00e3o iniciado a \n\ndescri\u00e7\u00e3o dos comportamentos reprodutores e a constru\u00e7\u00e3o do respectivo etograma. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nPosteriormente, no in\u00edcio de Maio de 2015, procedeu-se \u00e0 quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\ncomportamentos reprodutores em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do substrato (plantas, meadas de l\u00e3 e are\u00e3o) e do \n\nper\u00edodo do dia (8h30-11h30, 11h30-14h30 e 15h00-18h00). Os valores de temperatura e a \n\nquantidade de luz incidente no tanque experimental a cada quatro horas foram registados \n\nautomaticamente com um data logger. \n\n A monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos ref\u00fagios estivais revelou que os p\u00eagos com maior \u00e1rea se \n\nencontravam no Rio Sizandro, enquanto que os do Rio Alcabrichel apresentavam um \n\nmaior volume. O n\u00famero de indiv\u00edduos capturados por p\u00eago foi superior no Rio \n\nSizandro e inferior no Rio Safarujo. A abund\u00e2ncia relativa do ruivaco-do-Oeste em cada \n\np\u00eago apresentou uma associa\u00e7\u00e3o positiva com a temperatura da \u00e1gua e a abund\u00e2ncia de \n\nmacr\u00f3fitas e negativa com a profundidade. Os maiores valores de abund\u00e2ncia relativa \n\nforam observados em dois p\u00eagos que foram alvo de ac\u00e7\u00f5es de repovoamento, um no Rio \n\nAlcabrichel e outro no Rio Sizandro, que foram alvo de ac\u00e7\u00f5es de repovoamento em \n\n2011 e 2013. Nestes p\u00eagos, os indiv\u00edduos capturados apresentaram tamb\u00e9m valores \n\nrelativamente altos de condi\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica.  \n\n As distribui\u00e7\u00f5es de comprimento \u00e0 furca obtidas para as popula\u00e7\u00f5es do \n\nAlcabrichel e do Sizandro revelaram um padr\u00e3o bimodal, reflectindo muito \n\nprovavelmente o efeito das ac\u00e7\u00f5es de repovoamento no aumento das classes de idade \n\nmais jovens (0+ e 1+). Na popula\u00e7\u00e3o do Safarujo, a \u00fanica que n\u00e3o tinha sido alvo de \n\nqualquer ac\u00e7\u00e3o de repovoamento \u00e0 data das amostragens, a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de comprimento \n\napresentou um car\u00e1cter unimodal e uma maior variabilidade. \n\n A maior longevidade foi registada em indiv\u00edduos criados em cativeiro (5+). \n\nEstes indiv\u00edduos tendem a apresentar crescimentos superiores aos indiv\u00edduos selvagens, \n\nnas popula\u00e7\u00f5es do Alcabrichel e do Safarujo. Pelo contr\u00e1rio, nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es do \n\nSizandro, os indiv\u00edduos selvagens apresentaram maior crescimento, podendo esta \n\ndiferen\u00e7a dever-se \u00e0s menores temperaturas a que est\u00e1 sujeita a popula\u00e7\u00e3o do Sizandro \n\nmantida em cativeiro em Campelo. \n\n Relativamente ao comportamento reprodutor do ruivaco-do-Oeste, foi poss\u00edvel \n\nobservar comportamentos de pr\u00e9-postura que envolvem, maioritariamente, a \n\npersegui\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00eameas em pr\u00e9-postura por parte dos machos. Verificou-se uma maior \n\npreval\u00eancia dos comportamentos reprodutores junto a plantas aqu\u00e1ticas, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncom a actividade observada junto aos outros substratos dispon\u00edveis (are\u00e3o e meadas de \n\nl\u00e3), o que sugere que as plantas podem constituir o substrato preferencial para a desova \n\nnesta esp\u00e9cie. \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n Globalmente, os dados recolhidos atrav\u00e9s da abordagem multidisciplinar \n\ndesenvolvida para o estudo do ruivaco-do-Oeste revelaram que (1) as ac\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nrepovoamento podem efectivamente contribuir para o refor\u00e7o das classes de idade mais \n\njovens e para um poss\u00edvel aumento de tamanho e condi\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica individual; (2) p\u00eagos \n\ncom maior volume e abund\u00e2ncia de macr\u00f3fitas s\u00e3o locais potenciais para futuras ac\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde repovoamento; (3) a presen\u00e7a de plantas aqu\u00e1ticas \u00e9, muito provavelmente, essencial \n\npara o sucesso reprodutor desta esp\u00e9cie e consequentemente para o recrutamento de \n\ncolonizadores em cada ano, sendo este um dos crit\u00e9rios que deve ser tido em conta na \n\nescolha de locais para futuras ac\u00e7\u00f5es de repovoamento; (4) independentemente das boas \n\nindica\u00e7\u00f5es obtidas atrav\u00e9s das monitoriza\u00e7\u00f5es de popula\u00e7\u00f5es selvagens, o programa de \n\nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o ex situ desta esp\u00e9cie, para ser plenamente conseguido, dever\u00e1 ser \n\nacompanhado por uma melhoria significativa de tro\u00e7os de cada uma das ribeiras \n\nhabitadas pelo ruivaco-do-Oeste.  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nIberian cyprinids include a high number of endemic and highly threatened species. One \n\nof such species is the Portuguese western ruivaco Achondrostoma occidentale which is \n\ncurrently under threat mainly due to habitat degradation and water scarcity, risks that \n\nare further potentiated by its low geographic range and reduced genetic diversity. \n\nAlthough A. occidentale has been the target of an ex situ conservation program since \n\n2007, there is still a considerable lack of baseline information on this species.  \n\nThis study aimed to gather data on habitat use, population abundance and \n\ncondition, growth and reproductive behaviour that could provide valuable guidelines to \n\nfuture restocking actions. Fish and habitat surveys were conducted in persistent pools \n\nthat could act as summer refugia. Growth rates were determined for wild and captive \n\npopulations and reproductive behaviour was studied in specimens bred in captivity.  \n\nResults showed that (1) macrophytes\u2019 coverage was positively associated and \n\npool depth was negatively associated with fish relative abundance; (2) restocking \n\nactions led to a reinforcement of lower age classes in A. occidentale wild populations; \n\n(3) captive populations of the Alcabrichel and Safarujo rivers have higher growth rates \n\nthan the corresponding wild ones; and (4) aquatic vegetation is the preferred substrate \n\nfor spawning in this species.  \n\nTaken together, these results suggest that future restocking actions should be \n\naccompanied by habitat recovery, focusing on river bank vegetation, and conducted in \n\npersistent pools with high water volumes and abundant aquatic vegetation. It is also \n\nrecommended that these actions are followed by annual surveys in order to assess the \n\nrecovery of wild populations of A. occidentale. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: endangered cyprinids, ex situ conservation, habitat use, growth, \n\nreproductive behaviour \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n \n\n1.1. Current status and threats to Iberian cyprinids \n\nFreshwater fishes are amongst the most threatened organisms in the world \n\n(Duncan and Lockwood 2001, Maceda-Veiga 2012, Carrizo et al. 2013). Cyprinids are \n\nthe most diverse family, show a worldwide distribution (Nelson 2006) and include some \n\nof the world\u2019s most threatened species (Duncan and Lockwood 2001). However, due \n\nto their lack of economic and fishing value (Doadrio 2001), there is few funding to the \n\nconservation of these species, namely through captive breeding (Sousa-Santos 2014a). \n\nIn the Iberian Peninsula, the cyprinid fauna includes a large proportion of \n\nendemic species (Doadrio et al. 2001, Cabral et al. 2005), which is mainly a \n\nconsequence of the persistence of geographic barriers that strongly reduce the \n\npossibilities of colonization of this region by freshwater fishes (Robalo et al. 2006). \n\nIndeed, the complete elevation of the Pyrenees and the refill of the Mediterranean after \n\nthe Messinian salinity crisis seem to have played a major role in preventing further \n\ncontacts between Iberian and, respectively, Central European and African river systems \n\n(Levy et al. 2009). \n\nMost Iberian cyprinids are highly threatened (Smith et al. 2006, Hermoso and \n\nClavero 2011). Indeed, the proportion of threatened species in this region is amongst the \n\nhighest recorded in the IUCN assessment of the conservation status of freshwater \n\nfishes in Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011). This situation is mainly due to several \n\nhuman-caused threats, including pollution, damming, water abstraction, and the spread \n\nof exotic species (Cabral et al. 2005). Additionally, Iberian cyprinids generally display \n\nlow genetic diversity (Sousa-Santos et al. 2013) and small geographic distribution \n\nranges (Cabral et al. 2005, Doadrio et al. 2001), which enhance their risk of \n\nimperilment. Currently, 26 out of the 38 species of Iberian cyprinids raise some level of \n\nconservation concern (Cabral et al. 2005, Doadrio et al. 2001). \n\n1.2. The western ruivaco Achondrostoma occidentale \n\nIn Portugal, cyprinids and other freshwater and migrating fishes form the second most \n\nthreatened group of vertebrates, with 67% of the ciprinid species classified as \n\nVulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered, in the Portuguese Red Book of \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nVertebrates (Cabral et al. 2005). Of the 21 native cyprinid species currently found in \n\nPortugal, 6 are \u201cCritically Endangered\u201d and 6 are \u201cEndangered\u201d (Cabral et al. 2005, \n\nFreyhof and Kottelat 2008, IUCN 2015). \n\nThe western ruivaco Achondrostoma occidentale (Robalo, Almada, Sousa-\n\nSantos, Moreira and Doadrio 2005) is one of the cyprinids endemic to Portugal listed as \n\n\u201cEndangered\u201d by the IUCN (Freyhof and Kottelat 2008).This small species reaches a \n\nmean adult size of 100 mm fork-length (Robalo et al. 2008) and shows a reduced \n\ndistribution range, occurring only in three small independent basins in the western slope \n\nof Portugal: Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo (Figure 1.1) which face severe \n\npollution, water abstraction, and habitat destruction (Robalo et al. 2008). The \n\nreproductive season extends from late April to early May (Robalo et al. 2008) and \n\nspawning seems to occur in aquatic plants, according to studies in captivity (Pereira \n\n2007). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1. Location and general characteristics of the river basins inhabited by the western ruivaco A. \n\noccidentale [Illustration by Clara Almada]. \n\nMorphologically, A. occidentale resembles to the other two species of the \n\nAchondrostoma genus occurring in Portugal (Achondrostoma arcasii and \n\nAchondrostoma oligolepis), with orange coloration in the insertion of the pectoral, \n\npelvic and anal fins (Robalo et al. 2005) - see Figure 1.2. Phylogenetically, A. \n\noccidentale is close to A. arcasii from the northwestern Iberian river basins (Robalo et \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nal. 2006). A recent genetic survey revealed that A. occidentale populations are currently \n\ngenetically depleted (Sousa-Santos et al. 2013) - see Appendix I.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. A. occidentale live specimen. Photo credits: J\u00f6rg Freyhoff. \n\n1.3. Captive breeding as a species conservation measure \n\nAfter the description of A. occidentale, surveys conducted in 2005 and 2006 in \n\nthe Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers revealed that populations were small and \n\nfragmented (C. Sousa-Santos unpublished data). Moreover, a severe drought was still in \n\ncourse at the end of 2005 (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al. 2007), and long river stretches were \n\nalready dry, increasing the risk of loss of individuals and local extinctions. In these \n\ncircumstances, a stock of adult individuals from the Alcabrichel River was captured and \n\nmaintained in a tank at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium as an extreme safeguard measure \n\n(Sousa-Santos et al. 2014). Sizandro wild specimens were also captured, but they were \n\nfirst used for a study on reproductive behaviour (Pereira 2007) and only afterwards \n\nstocked for captive breeding, at the Campelo Station (Table 1.1). \n\nThe spontaneous reproduction of this species in captivity (Gil et al. 2010) \n\nprompted the launching of an ex situ conservation program targeting A. occidentale and \n\nother five highly threatened cyprinids (see details in Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). \n\nSimilarly to other captive breeding programs (e.g. Bice et al. 2013, Hammer et al. \n\n2013), the final goal of this program was to release captive bred populations in the \n\nstreams where their founders were collected, after the requalification of at least some \n\nriver stretches (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014). Indeed, captive breeding has been shown to \n\nbe essential in preventing the extinction of several threatened species (e.g. Adamski et \n\nal. 2007, Rakes et al. 2013), by providing a high number of offspring per generation \n\nwhich can be used to restock wild populations with low effective population sizes \n\n(Champagnon et al. 2012). \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nBecause avoiding artificial selection and domestication is crucial in ex situ \n\nconservation programs aiming to restock wild populations (Saura et al. 2008), a \n\n\u2018\u2018naturalistic approach\u2019\u2019 of the reproduction was adopted for A. occidentale, aiming to \n\nbreed and rear fish in conditions that would preserve the natural behavioural patterns of \n\nthe species (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). This approach relied on: (1) naturally occurring \n\nspawning, without artificial stimulation or hormonal induction, (2) availability of refuge \n\nareas for fry and juveniles; (3) natural conditions of light and temperature, essential for \n\ngonadal maturation; and (4) minimal human intervention (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). \n\nTo account for the eventual genetic diversity loss due to inbreeding and lineage sorting, \n\ncaptive breeding from the same initial stock was, in general, limited to three consecutive \n\ngenerations (one per year), and after the release of all the fish produced, new captive \n\npopulations were founded from newly captured wild individuals (Sousa-Santos et al. \n\n2014). Further details on the methods used and full descriptions of the ex situ \n\nconservation facilities can be found in Sousa-Santos et al. (2014a). \n\nSince 2006, under the scope of the ex situ Conservation Program, seven captive \n\nstocks of A. occidentale were founded at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium and at the \n\nCampelo Station, and their offspring were used to restock their respective wild \n\npopulations (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a and unpublished data) - see Table 1.1. \n\nTable 1.1. Year of foundation of the captive breeding populations of A. occidentale at the Vasco da Gama \n\nAquarium (AVG) and at the Campelo Station (CS), and of the restocking actions in wild populations. \n\nNote: Restocking of the Safarujo population in 2015 occurred after the collection of the data presented in \n\nthis thesis. \n\n \n\nOverall, between March 2011 and April 2015, seven restocking actions of the \n\nwild populations were conducted, comprising the release of 6577 fish reared in captivity \n\n(Table 1.1): five restocking actions at the Alcabrichel River (N=4918 individuals), one \n\nRiver basin \nEx situ \n\nfacilities \n\nIntroduction \n\nin captivity \n\nNumber of \n\nspawners \n\nRestocking \n\naction \n\nNumber of \n\nindividuals released \n\nAlcabrichel AVG 2006 16 2011 400 \n\nAlcabrichel CS 2009 45 2011 400 \n\nAlcabrichel CS 2011 60 2013 1190 \n\nAlcabrichel AVG 2011 60 2013 446 \n\nAlcabrichel CS 2013 60 2015 2482 \n\nSizandro CS 2009 19 2013 1309 \n\nSafarujo AVG 2012 12 2015 350 \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nat the Sizandro River (N=1309 individuals) and one at the Safarujo River (N=350) \n\n(Sousa-Santos et al. 2014 and unpublished data). In all cases, fish were released in \n\nupstream stretches, in areas with preserved habitats and good water quality (see Figure \n\n3.1 in Material and Methods for site locations), after being marked by cutting off the \n\ndorsal fin, for easy identification of recaptured individuals in future surveys. Fin cut off \n\nhas been shown to have minor effects on fish, with scars persisting quite visible over \n\ntime (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). Nevertheless, to avoid injuring small fish, individuals \n\nsmaller than 50 mm fork-length were not marked. As it is essential that ex situ \n\nconservation programs are supported by habitat restoration actions, some efforts were \n\nalso made concerning water quality improvement and habitat rehabilitation, especially \n\nat the Alcabrichel River, where natural engineering techniques were used to recover \n\nspawning habitats and prevent river bank erosion (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). \n \n\n1.4. Integrating ecological and ethological data into restocking programs \n\nBesides captive breeding and habitat restoration, the adoption of effective measures \n\ntowards the conservation of endangered species generally benefits from \n\nmultidisciplinary data on the target species, namely on habitat influence (Granado-\n\nLorencio 1992), population prioritization, dynamics and distribution (Magalh\u00e3es et al. \n\n2002a, Magalh\u00e3es et al. 2003, Clarkson et al. 2012), genetics and evolutionary history \n\n(Robalo et al. 2007, Karaiskou et al. 2011, Kitanishi et al. 2013), behaviour (Sutherland \n\n1998, Robalo et al. 2007, Ozer and Ashley 2013) and habitat use (Santos and Ferreira \n\n2008, Martelo et al. 2014). Given the characteristics of the rivers inhabited by A. \n\noccidentale, with a high level of pollution and flow intermittence (ARHTejo 2011), and \n\nthe fragmentation revealed in these species populations (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a), the \n\nlater approaches towards the conservation of endangered species can assume a vital role \n\nin this specific case. \n\n Rivers in southern Iberian Peninsula are generally intermittent, showing seasonal \n\nfloods and droughts of variable intensity, in association with fluctuations in rainfall \n\n(Granado-Lorencio 1992, Clavero et al. 2004). Drying is likely to be particularly \n\nsignificant for fish, as it results in major habitat contraction and loss of connectivity \n\nthroughout the stream network (Magalh\u00e3es et al. 2002b). This particular context makes \n\nit essential to understand which habitats may act as refugia and favour the persistence of \n\nA. occidentale along the river courses during the dry season, as those should be \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nconsidered priority areas for protection and restoration and may configure potential \n\nlocations for restocking actions. \n\nEthological studies can also have an essential contribute to the conservation of \n\nA. occidentale, as it has already been demonstrated that data on the spawning behaviour \n\nshould be taken into account in the context of fish conservation, and particularly of \n\ncaptive breeding and restocking (Rakes et al. 1999, Carvalho 2003, Carvalho et al. \n\n2003, Pereira 2007, Goren 2009, Sousa-Santos et al. 2014). Although all cyprinids are \n\noviparous with external fertilization, there is high variability in their behavioural \n\npatterns (Pereira 2007). Until now, studies on the spawning behaviour of Portuguese \n\nnative cyprinids were only conducted for A. oligolepis and A. occidentale (Pereira \n\n2007), Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum (Carvalho et al. 2003), Pseudochondrostoma \n\npolylepis (Robalo et al. 2003), Squalius pyrenaicus (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014b) and \n\nSqualius alburnoides (Sousa-Santos et al. 2006).  \n\nOne example of how these studies may have implications for species \n\nconservation is the captive breeding of S.  pyrenaicus at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium: \n\nafter two years without spawning, this species finally reproduced when the tank was \n\nsupplemented with coarse substratum (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014b). The existence of \n\npreferred substrates is common among cyprinids (e.g. Johnston 1999) and, thus, \n\npreserving those spawning grounds may be crucial for species recruitment and \n\nultimately for species survival. Regarding A. occidentale, Pereira (2007) found some \n\nevidence of preference for egg laying on plants when studying a group of breeding fish \n\nin a small aquarium. However, it is important to test this preference at a larger scale and \n\nwith a higher number of individuals, so that captive breeding may be optimized and \n\nsubstrate preference for spawning may be taken into account when choosing sites for \n\nrestocking of wild populations of A. occidentale. \n\nLife history patterns should also be taken into account for effective conservation \n\nmeasures to protect threatened species (Aparicio and Sostoa 1998). In particular, \n\nknowledge of variation in traits such as age and sex composition, growth in length and \n\nweight, length-weight relationships, somatic condition, spawning time and age of \n\nmaturity and fecundity is particularly important. (Andreu-Soler et al. 2006, Miranda et \n\nal. 2006, Sarkar et al. 2013).  For instance, analyses of growth and condition of A. \n\noccidentale along habitat gradients will provide significant insights on which sites are \n\nmore favourable to the growth of juveniles and, consequently, potentially configure \n\nreleasing sites during restocking actions. \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n1.5. Objectives \n\nThis work follows a multidisciplinary approach to gather some baseline but essential \n\ninformation on habitat use, growth and reproductive behaviour of wild and captive \n\npopulations of A. occidentale, which may contribute to improve the efficiency of future \n\nrestocking of their natural populations. Specific aims were to (i) quantify relative \n\nabundances, age and condition of fish in persistent pools that can act as summer refugia \n\nfor this species, and habitat factors that may influence these; (ii) analyze the growth \n\npatterns of captive populations and compare them with those of wild populations; and \n\n(iii) describe the reproductive behaviour of A. occidentale in captivity and assess \n\nsubstrate preferences for spawning. \n\nConcealing all the data gathered, this work will contribute with key aspects on \n\nthe ecology of A. occidentale and on the differences in population traits between wild \n\nand captive populations, which might be useful to achieve more efficient reinforcements \n\nunder the scope of the ongoing ex situ conservation program and, consequently, to the \n\nconservation of the species. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n2. STUDY AREA \n \n\nThe Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers, ranging from 18 to 37 km in length \n\n(Figure 1.1), are shaped by highly seasonal flows, showing reduced or no flow in the \n\nsummer and large floods in the winter. During the summer, the streams are often \n\nreduced to a series of disconnected pools, which represent the only chance of fish to \n\npersist by acting as refugia and as sources of recruits or colonists for the entire system, \n\nafter flow resumption at the end of the dry season (Magalh\u00e3es et al. 2002, Pires et al. \n\n2014). \n\nMoreover, these rivers face strong habitat destruction and pollution, especially \n\ndue to sewage from pig farms, distilleries, and agricultural and urban discharges \n\n(Robalo et al. 2005, Robalo et al. 2008). Indeed, the Alcabrichel River has been \n\nclassified as highly degraded, based on the results obtained for the biotic index based on \n\nmacroinvertebrates IBMWP (Teixeira et al. 2008) and the Safarujo River is known to \n\ndry out almost completely in years of severe droughts. Indeed, the population of A. \n\noccidentale of the Safarujo River was thought to be extinct until 2011 (Sousa-Santos \n\npersonal communication). \n\nThere is also a high abundance of Arundo donax along the margins of these \n\nstreams, preventing native vegetation from growing and stabilizing the river banks \n\n(Figure 2.1). Riparian vegetation is sparse and constantly under removal (ARHTejo \n\n2011), and includes the narrow-leaved ash Fraxinus angustifolia, the white poplar \n\nPopulus alba and the willow Salix salvifolia. \n\nBesides A. occidentale, fish assemblages include the European Eel Anguilla \n\nanguilla and the loach Cobitis paludica. The presence of exotic fish species was not \n\nreported so far. The invasive red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii is also abundant \n\nin the studied rivers. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Arundo donax plantations along the Alcabrichel River. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\n3. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n \n\n3.1. Survey of wild populations in summer refugia \n\nSurveys of wild populations of A. occidentale were conducted at the end of the dry \n\nseason, immediately before the rains, when fish remain gathered in persistent pools, \n\nwhich act as summer refugia and sources of colonization for the entire rivers after flow \n\nresumption. Specifically, surveys for fish and habitat conditions in persistent pools, \n\nwere conducted between 11\nth\n\n September and 8\nth\n\n October 2014 in the Alcabrichel, \n\nSizandro and Safarujo rivers. \n\nThe upper and medium courses of the each river were prospected by car in order \n\nto map (WGS84 datum coordinate system) all the pools persisting in the channel. Lower \n\ncourses of the rivers were not surveyed because they show high habitat degradation and \n\npoor water quality, and thus are not suitable for future restocking actions. The \n\nprospected stretches in the upper and medium courses of the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and \n\nSarafujo Rivers were approximately 13.75, 15.60 and 11.24 km long, respectivelly. \n\nOverall, 14 pools persisted in the Alcabrichel (6), Sizandro (3) and Safarujo (5) rivers - \n\nFigure 3.1. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1. Persistent pools in the middle and upper courses of the Alcabrichel (ALC1 to ALC6), \n\nSizandro (SIZ1 to SIZ3) and Sarafujo (SAF1 to SAF5) rivers surveyed for fish and habitat conditions.  \n\n* pools subjected to fish restocking actions prior to the collection of the data presented herein. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nFish sampling was performed with a SAMUS725G electrofishing portable \n\ndevice. Each pool was slowly prospected in a zigzag manner from the downriver to the \n\nupriver edge. In order to get an estimate of the fish relative abundance, time of fishing \n\nwas roughly proportional to pool size (Appendix II). All captured fish were maintained \n\nin permanently aerated buckets, measured (fork length, nearest millimetre) and \n\nweighted (total body weight, nearest gram), and three scales were taken from \n\nindividuals with over 40 mm length, from the third scale row below the dorsal fin \n\n(Appendix III). The scales were stored in field sheets with scotch tape for \n\ntransportation and posterior age and growth analyses (see section 3.3). The dorsal fin of \n\neach fish was inspected for the presence of a horizontal scar (mark used to identify \n\nindividuals bred in captivity - see section 1.3). Finally, all individuals were returned to \n\nthe river.  \n\nThe habitat at each pool was described using 15 variables: maximum length (in \n\nmeters), maximum width (in centimetres), maximum depth (in centimetres), area (in \n\nm\n2\n), volume (in m\n\n3\n), macrophytes\u2019 coverage, instream coverage and detritus abundance \n\n(0: 0%, 1:&lt;30%, 2: 30-60%, 3: >60%), dominant substrate [(1: silt (4-64) \u00b5m, 2: sand \n\n(64 \u00b5m-2 mm), 3: gravel (2-64 mm), 4: cobbles (64-256 mm), 5: boulders (>256 mm)], \n\nsubstrate heterogeneity (number of substrate categories), water temperature (in \u00baC), \n\nammonia (in mg/L), nitrites (in mg/L), nitrates (in mg/L) and pH (Table 3.1). Photos of \n\nsome of the procedures used to determine habitat variables can be found in Appendix \n\nIV. \n\nTable 3.1. Variables used to characterize the habitat in the summer refugia.

Survey of captive populations \n\nCaptive populations of A. occidentale maintained at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium \n\n(AVG) and at the Campelo Station (CS) were surveyed between March and April 2015. \n\nIn order to minimize the disturbance of these populations, only a small number of \n\nindividuals were sampled for fork-length and scale analyses (Table 3.2).  \n\nAfter lowering the water level, the tanks were prospected with hand nets and the \n\ncaptured fish were maintained in permanently aerated buckets. All fish with at least 40 \n\nmm were measured (fork-length, nearest millimetre) and three scales from the third \n\nscale row below the dorsal fin were collected. \n\nTable 3.2.

Age and growth \n\nAge was determined through scale reading, by counting the number of annuli, \n\ncorresponding to the number of years (Chilton and Beamish 1982). Scales were \n\nmounted on microscope slides with a water drop and the annuli were interpreted. Scale \n\nand annuli radiuses were measured in the right side of the anterior field of the scale, \n\nwhich generally showed low pigmentation and clear evidence of annuli (Figure 3.2). \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nMeasurements were performed using Motic Images Plus software (Motic China Group, \n\nversion 2.0). \n\nFork-length at age i was back-calculated from linear regression equations, \n\nfollowing the body-proportional hypothesis described by Rasmussen et al. (1996).  \n\nEquations used in calculations are presented in Appendix V. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.

The centre and right anterior edge of each \n\nscale were determined by establishing a 75\u00ba angle between two auxiliary lines (in grey). \n\n3.4. Reproductive behaviour \n\nObservations of the spawning behaviour of A. occidentale were conducted with a \n\ncaptive population from the Safarujo River, founded with 12 wild adults in 2013, at the \n\nVasco da Gama Aquarium. In 2015, this captive population consisted of 369 \n\nindividuals, 44 of which were adults (>70 mm fork-length) and 325 were juveniles (<70 \n\nmm fork-length). As reproductive behaviour is not performed by juveniles, only adults \n\nwere considered for this study. Mature females were identified by their swollen \n\nabdomen, whereas mature males were recognized by their fusiform body, presence of \n\nnuptial tubercles in the head and conspicuous behaviours performed towards females. \n\nThe experimental tank (designated as T9 in Figure 3.3) had a capacity of 3120 L \n\n(500x195x32 cm), continuous water supply and regulation, and two permanent air \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nsources to maintain regular levels of dissolved O2. Because the captive breeding of this \n\nspecies followed a naturalistic approach (described in detail in Sousa-Santos et al. \n\n2014a), bricks and a cage with a small mesh diameter were placed in the tank in order to \n\nprovide shelter for juveniles and larvae, respectively. A wood pier was also present to \n\nprovide shading to about one third of the tank, resembling the instream coverage \n\nprovided by the riparian gallery in wild habitats. The tank was also supplied with pots \n\ncontaining aquatic plants with abundant submerged roots (Cyperus alternifolius, \n\nEchinodorus sp., Egeria densa, Elodea sp. and Typha latifolia) - see Figure 3.4. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3. Schematic sketch of the ex situ conservation facility at the Vasco da Gama Aquarium, The \n\nobservations on the spawning behaviour of A. occidentale were conducted in tank T9. \n\nFish behaviour was recorded with an underwater camera (Nikon Coolpix \n\nAW100) placed in fixed positions to minimize disturbance and stress. The quantitative \n\nanalysis of the reproductive behaviour data was preceded by a period of informal \n\nobservations (from 11\nth\n\n December 2014 to 25\nth\n\n March 2015), aiming at defining the \n\ntypical behaviour of the species off the reproductive season, and by a period of \n\npreliminary observations (from April 2\nnd\n\n to April 30\nth\n\n), aiming at defining the \n\nbehavioural patterns associated with reproductive behaviour and determining the \n\nethogram of the species, as advised by Martin and Bateson (1986). The period of \n\npreliminary observations began when males started performing typical reproductive \n\nbehaviours, namely long runs and female chasing (described in detail by Pereira 2007). \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nAfter the description of the ethogram of the species, observations of the \n\nreproductive behaviour were carried out (from 5\nth\n\n May 2015 to 24\nth\n\n May 2015) during \n\nthree periods of the day to account for eventual variations of fish activity throughout the \n\nday: i) 8h30 to 11h30, ii) 11h30 to 14h30, and iii) 15h00 to 18h00. As feeding took \n\nplace between 14h30 and 15h00 thrice a week, no records were taken during that time \n\nperiod to avoid bias in behaviour due to feeding.  \n\nSubstrate preferences for spawning were assessed using an experimental design \n\nsimilar to that described by Pereira (2007). Within each of the time periods described \n\nabove, recording sessions with 20 minutes of duration were conducted at three distinct \n\nsubstrate sites (each site was sampled once or twice): plants, wool spawning mops (see \n\nAppendix VI) and gravel. The aquatic camera used to record observations was placed \n\nat 27 cm depth when sampling the sites with plants and wool mops, and at 22 cm depth \n\nwhen sampling the gravel site. In each recording session, the absolute frequency of the \n\nbehaviours described in the ethogram was quantified. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4.

Arrows indicate the \n\ndirection of recording. \n\nTo assess the eventual effect of temperature and light in the onset of \n\nreproductive behaviours of A. occidentale, one data logger (Hobo\n\u00ae\n Pendant UA-002) \n\nwas installed in the experimental tank on 9\nth\n\n April 2015. Data concerning water \n\ntemperature (in \u00baC) and light quantity (in lux) were automatically recorded every four \n\nhours (7:00, 11:00, 15:00, 19:00, 23:00, 3:00) until the end of the study (24\nth\n\n May \n\n2015). \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n3.5. Data analyses \n\nData analyses focused on quantifying variation in population traits between wild and \n\ncaptive populations and on assessing patterns on the reproductive behaviour of A. \n\noccidentale.  Prior to analyses, data were assessed for normality and homogeneity, and \n\nnon-parametric statistics were used when these assumptions were not met. Significance \n\nof statistical testing was assessed at p<0.05 and analyses were conducted using the R \n\nsoftware (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, version 3.0.3) and STATISTICA \n\nsoftware (Dell Inc., version 12). Statistical procedures are detailed in sections 3.5.1 and \n\n3.5.2. \n\n \n\n3.5.1.  Relative abundance of fish in summer refugia \n\nThe number of fish caught in each pool was used to index its relative abundance, and \n\nfurther related to habitat gradients prevailing in the study area. Principal Components \n\nAnalysis (PCA) was used to describe the main gradients of variation in habitat \n\nconditions. To avoid bias in the ordination, all habitat variables that were not measured \n\nin all persistent pools (n=14, see Table 3.1), i.e. ammonia and pH, were excluded from \n\nthe analyses. Likewise, maximum length and width were also excluded, because they \n\nwere considered for both pool area and volume calculations, To minimize collinearity \n\nproblems, whenever pairs of habitat variables were strongly correlated (Pearson\u2019s r, |r| ? \n\n0.80; Appendix VII), only the variable most correlated with relative abundance from \n\neach pair was retained for analyses. Principal components (PC) axes were then used as \n\nexplanatory variables in linear regression analyses relating fish relative abundance to \n\nhabitat gradients. \n\n \n\n3.5.2.  Fork-length distributions and condition factor in wild populations \n\nFork-length distributions were built for each population by pooling data from persistent \n\npools. Size class amplitude used in histograms was of 2 mm.  \n\nCondition factor for each individual was determined using the scaled mass index \n\n(SMI), following the procedure described by Peig and Green (2009). Specifically, the \n\nSMI was calculated using the following formula adapted from Peig and Green (2009), \n\n       \n   \n   \n\n \n    \n\n \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nwhere W is the measured weight, FL0 the observed mean fork-length in each river, FLi \n\nthe fork-length measured for each individual and bSMI the slope of the linear regression \n\nequation of weight and fork-length log-transformed data. \n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test for variation in fork-length and in the \n\nSMI among populations, and the post hoc Dunn test was performed whenever \n\nsignificant differences were found. Fish length at each pool (mean, minimum and \n\nmaximum) was related to habitat gradients extracted from PC axes using linear \n\nregression analyses. \n\n \n\n3.5.3.  Age and growth \n\nThe back-calculated lengths at age i were compared among wild and captive \n\npopulations  by using the one-way ANOVA test, followed by the Tukey post hoc test \n\nwhenever significant differences were found. Comparisons between wild and captive \n\npopulations were also conducted using either the t-test (for the Alcabrichel and Safarujo \n\npopulations) or the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (for the Sizandro population). \n\n \n\n3.5.4.  Factors shaping reproductive behaviour \n\nTo test whether the frequency of behaviours across substrates was independent of the \n\ntime period during which the observations were recorded, a chi-square of independence \n\nwas performed. A chi-square test of homogeneity was also used to test for variation of \n\nthe frequency of behaviours amongst substrates. In both cases, behaviours with \n\nfrequencies below 5 were excluded from analysis to avoid lowering inference reliability \n\n(Roscoe and Byars 1971). \n\nThe pooled absolute frequencies of each behaviour per day, taken as an indicator \n\nof the fish reproductive activity, were plotted against the average daily temperature and \n\nlight incidence to assess eventual associations between fish activity and \n\ntemperature/light incidence. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n4. RESULTS \n \n\n4.1. Habitat variability in summer refugia \n\nPersistent pools ranged between 45.39 m\n2\n (in Safarujo) and 268.49 m\n\n2\n (in Sizandro) in \n\narea and between 4.83 m\n3\n (in Safarujo) and 63.38 m\n\n3\n (in Alcabrichel) in volume (Table \n\n4.1). In average, pools in the Alcabrichel River showed the highest water volume and \n\nwere the longest and deepest, while pools in the Sizandro River were the largest in area \n\nand width, the shallowest and the ones with the highest instream and macrophytes\u2019 \n\ncoverages. The pools in the Safarujo River were, in average, the smallest in area, \n\nvolume, length and width and the ones with the lowest macrophytes\u2019 coverage. \n\nSubstrate was dominated by silt  in Alcabrichel and by sand in the Sizandro and \n\nSafarujo rivers. The average amount of nitrites and nitrates was higher in the \n\nAlcabrichel and Sizandro rivers, whilst ammonia was higher in the Sarafujo \n\n(0.12\u00b10.16); average pH ranged between 7.36 in Alcabrichel and 8.00 in Sizandro. \n\nTable 4.1.

In these circunstamces, \n\nvolume and area were not further considered in the ordination. \n\nThe first three componens of the PCA explained 65.5% of the variation in the \n\nhabitat data (Table 4.2).

Fish relative abundance in summer refugia \n\nA total of 1005 individuals were caught in the 14 persistent pools found in the \n\nAlcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers (Figure 4.3).

The highest fish relative abundance values were detected at one of the restocking \n\nsites of the Alcabrichel River and dowstream from the restocking site for the Sizandro \n\nRiver (Figure 4.3). \n\nOnly 4 individuals had a clear horizontal scar in the dorsal fin, indicative of \n\nbeing from a captive facility: three at SIZ2 (fork-length ranging from 78 mm to 106 \n\nmm) and one at ALC6 (102 mm fork-length).  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3.

Age and growth of fish in wild and captive populations \n\nIn wild populations, fish were aged from 0+ (born in 2014) to 4+ (born in 2009) and, in \n\nall persistent pools, 0+ individuals were the most abundant, except in ALC 6 (1+). Fish \n\naged 5+ were only found in the captive populations of Alcabrichel and Safarujo kept, \n\nrespectively, at the Campelo Station and Vasco da Gama Aquarium (see Table 4.6). \n\nThe highest annual increment in fork-length was attained on the first year of life \n\nin all populations (Table 4.6). Back-calculated length at age 1 varied significantly \n\namong rivers in wild with all populations (F=143.75, p<0.000), with all populations \n\ndiffering from each other (Tukey post hoc test, p<0.05). Among captive populations, \n\nthere were also significant differences (F=13.99, p<0.000), but only the Sizandro \n\npopulation was significantly different from the Alcabrichel and Safarujo specimens \n\n(Tukey post hoc test, p<0.05). Fish from the Sizandro population showed the highest \n\nmean fork-length at age 1 (FL = 72 \u00b1 2 mm) and those from the Alcabrichel the lowest \n\nvalue at the same age (FL = 56 \u00b1 1 mm) - see Table 4.6. \n\nWhen comparing wild and captive populations of the same river, significant \n\ndifferences were found for all rivers. Individuals were significantly smaller in wild \n\npopulations of the Alcabrichel (T=-6.273, p<0.000) and Safarujo (T=-4.262, p<0.000) \n\nthan in their respective captive populations, whereas for the Sizandro individuals of the \n\ncaptive population were smaller than the wild ones (Z=-4.805, p<0.000). \n\nTable 4.6.

Ethogram of reproductive behaviours \n\nFour out of the five behaviours described in Pereira (2007) were also found during the \n\nperiod of preliminary observations: \n\n? Follow - a male follows a female with his snout close to her tail fin or parallel to \n\nits body, without touching her and with no alterations on the movement of both \n\nindividuals; \n\n? Chase - a male pursues an evading female; \n\n? Touch - a male follows a female with his snout close to her tail fin or parallel to \n\nits body, touching her in the ventral zone; \n\n? Pressure - one or more males try to push a female to the bottom of the tank. \n\nDuring this period, egg release was visualized only once, on 2\nnd\n\n April 2015, near \n\na plant pot. After being pressed against the ground of the tank by several males, the \n\nspawning female started shaking its body and released several eggs. It was not \n\nperceptible if the eggs adhered to the plants, as the angle caught by the camera was \n\ninsufficient. Moreover, the fixed placement of the underwater camera prevented the \n\nvideo recording of other egg laying events and of complete pre-spawning and spawning \n\nethological sequences. Fish larvae were first detected on 9\nth\n\n May 2015. \n\n4.7. Quantification of reproductive behaviours \n\nA total of 77 events of the described reproductive behaviours were observed in \n\n35 of the 90 recording sessions. In the remaining 55 sessions, no reproductive \n\nbehaviours were recorded. Most of the behaviours occurred in the proximity of plants \n\n(53 out of 77) and during the 11h30-14h30 sampling period (38 out of 77) - see Table \n\n4.7. \n\nTable 4.7.

The data \n\nlogger records show that, considering the period of spawning behaviour quantification \n\n(5\nth\n\n May to 24\nth\n\n May 2015), the second highest temperature (23.13\u00baC) and the third \n\nhighest light quantity (34157 lux) were registered on 8\nth\n\n May - see Figure 4.7). \n\nHowever, no significant association was detected between the frequency of behaviours \n\nand temperature and light (Table 4.9). \n\nTable 4.9.

DISCUSSION \n \n\nThe combination of deterministic and stochastic factors that negatively affect species \n\nsurvival may result in their extinction (Frankham 2005). Often the impact of these \n\nfactors is evidenced by considerable reductions of the effective population size and low \n\nlevels of genetic diversity (e.g. Hedrick 2001, Blomqvist et al. 2010, McCusker and \n\nBentzen 2013). To overcome this problem and, consequently, minimize the risk of \n\nextinction, threatened populations should be reinforced since demographic, rather than \n\ngenetic factors, may be of more immediate importance in the short term (Caro and \n\nLaurenson 1994, Caughley 1994, Brook et al. 2002). Indeed, it is argued that \n\npopulations that are declining rapidly or that are already small sized are more prone to \n\ndestabilization due to interacting stochastic processes, such as unbalanced sex ratios, \n\nunstable age class distributions or habitat loss, than larger populations (Lacy 2000, \n\nBrook et al. 2002). The reduction of the individual fitness due to small population size \n\nor low density (Allee effect) is frequently a problem for endangered species and, thus, \n\nrestocking can be used to provide higher long-term chances of survival (Griffith et al. \n\n1989, Champagnon et al. 2012).  \n\nThese theoretical expectations supported the enhancement of endangered \n\npopulations of A. occidentale with captive bred individuals, in order to minimize their \n\ncurrent risk of extinction in the wild. The data gathered in this thesis add to this view, \n\nand generally highlight that restocking already had some positive effects on wild \n\npopulations of this species.  \n\nThe severe drought that occurred nearly after the description of A. occidentale, \n\nin 2005-2006 (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al. 2007), and precipitated the implementation of its ex \n\nsitu conservation as a safeguard measure (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a), prevented the \n\nestablishment of strong baseline data on the abundance of this species throughout its \n\ndistribution range. Nevertheless, pilot surveys conducted in 2006 indicated that \n\npopulations were small and fragmented, with the number of fish per summer pool in the \n\nAlcabrichel and Sizandro rivers never exceeding 40 individuals and no fish being found \n\nacross the main course of the Safarujo River (C. Sousa-Santos unpublished data). \n\nContrastingly, during this study, much higher numbers of individuals per pool were \n\nfound in the Alcabrichel and Sizandro rivers, likely reflecting the restocking actions \n\nconducted in 2011 and 2013 for population reinforcement purposes. A. occidentale was \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nalso found in the Safarujo river, though in lower abundances, a positive sign considering \n\nit had been considered to be extinct after the 2005-2006 severe drought (Freyhof and \n\nKottelat 2008, C. Sousa-Santos unpublished data). \n\nThese signs of population increment and recovery must, however, be taken with \n\ncaution, since the desirable positive effect of restocking actions, habitat enhancement \n\nand water quality management must be evaluated in the medium and long term to \n\naccount for the natural oscillations of abundance associated, for instance, with annual \n\nhydrological conditions as found for other cyprinids endemic to Iberian streams (e.g. \n\nMagalh\u00e3es et al. 2007). \n\n \n\n5.1. Use of summer refugia \n\nDespite 2014 was a wet year with a \u201cnormal\u201d hydrological summer (IPMA 2014, IPMA \n\n2015), summer refugia in the middle and upper courses of the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and \n\nSafarujo rivers were restricted to a few persistent pools, generally with less than 70 m\n3\n. \n\nThere was considerable variability in the number of fish congregated in each pool, \n\nsuggesting that some pools may act as the main sources for river recolonization after the \n\ndrought and should therefore be considered as potential locations for further restocking \n\nactions. This seemed to be particularly the case for pools ALC2 and SIZ3 in the \n\nAlcabrichel and Sizandro rivers, respectively, where more than 170 individuals were \n\nfound, and generally in good condition.  \n\nOverall, associations between fish and habitat conditions found in this thesis \n\nsuggest that during normal hydrological years, A. occidentale wild populations may \n\nconcentrate on shallower pools with high macrophytes\u2019 coverage, similarly to what was \n\nassessed in other fish species (Dibble et al. 1997, Oscoz 2006). The obtained positive \n\nassociation with water temperature is most likely circumstantial, since values for this \n\nvariable were collected in distinct periods of the day, in different dates. Contrastingly, \n\nthe positive association of fish relative abundance with nitrates highlights that refugia \n\nmore prone to harbour fish may also be heavily polluted. As such, during extreme \n\ndroughts, these pools might configure precarious and unstable refugia for fish, as \n\nreduction in water persistence or slight deterioration of water quality through increased \n\nnitrates and/or decreased dissolved oxygen will likely imply massive fish loss. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\n5.2. Length and age structure of wild populations \n\nBesides its direct effect on increasing the size of wild populations, indirect effects of the \n\nrestocking actions may include (i) the increment of population recruitment (released \n\nmature fish will contribute with their offspring to forthcoming generations); and (ii) a \n\nshift on the previous distribution of age classes. Regarding the first indirect effect, the \n\nabsence of previous baseline data on the number of juveniles of A. occidentale produced \n\nper reproductive season prevents its assessment. Contrastingly, data collected during \n\nthis study provide highlights regarding the effect of restocking actions on the \n\ndistribution of age classes in wild populations. \n\nAs the restocking of wild populations consisted in the release of hundreds of \n\nindividuals 1+, 2+ and 3+ (as a result of three consecutive generations in captivity), it \n\nwas expected that, after one year, the restocked populations will not only show higher \n\nthan expected frequencies 2+, 3+ and 4+ individuals, but also of 0+ and 1+ individuals, \n\nas a result of the reproduction of the released mature fish. The bimodal length \n\ndistributions obtained for the Alcabrichel and Sizandro populations seemed to \n\ncorroborate this hypothesis. Indeed, the combination of the obtained length frequency \n\ndistributions and the back-calculated fork-length at ages 1 to 5 showed that 0+, 1+ and \n\n2+ fish dominate the Alcabrichel and Sizandro populations. As the last and more \n\nexpressive (in terms of the number of fish released) restocking actions were conducted \n\nin the Spring of 2013, mostly with F1 and F2 fish born in 2011 and 2012, it was \n\nexpected that in the Fall of 2014 these fish (belonging to the age classes 1+, 2+ and \n\neventually 3+ if the third annuli had already been deposited) and their offspring (0+ and \n\neventually 1+) contributed to a high frequency of age classes 0+ to 2+ in wild \n\npopulations, as seemed to be the case. \n\nAlthough only a low number of individuals bred in captivity were identified in \n\nthe wild, this may at least be partially associated with difficulties in identifying post-cut \n\nregenerated fin rays in small cyprinids (Gosline 1978) resulting in underestimation of  \n\npreviously marked fish. The number of recaptures may also have been underestimated \n\ndue to the fact that released individuals smaller than 50 mm fork-length were not \n\nmarked. In these circumstances, it seems plausible to admit that the largest mean fork-\n\nlengths and the highest condition values (SMI values) obtained for the restocking sites \n\nat the Alcabrichel and Sizandro populations are at least partially related to the release of \n\nhundreds of captive bred fish at those sites. Future restocking actions should involve \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nmore efficient individual marking (e.g. visible implant elastomer tags) to improve the \n\nestimation of recapture rates. \n\n Regarding the summer refugia of the Safarujo River, the relative abundances of \n\nA. occidentale were lower than that of the Alcabrichel and Sizandro populations, \n\nalthough showing a high representativeness of small fish. This suggests that the \n\npopulation of the Safarujo may be naturally, slowly recovering and that recruitment may \n\nbe at place (see below). As the Safarujo River was only restocked in 2015, after the field \n\nwork conducted during this study, future surveys are needed to clarify if this population \n\nreinforcement can also contribute to an increase in frequency of young, small fish. \n\n \n\n5.2. Age and growth patterns \n\nScale reading analysis provided baseline data on age and growth of wild and captive \n\npopulations of A. occidentale, which was unknown until the time of this work. The \n\nannuli counts revealed that the more aged specimens from wild populations were 4+ and \n\nthat the oldest specimens were found in captive populations (5+). Mean back-calculated \n\nlengths and annual increments at age i were also higher in captive than in wild \n\npopulations of the Alcabrichel and Safarujo rivers. Contrastingly, wild specimens from \n\nthe Sizandro population showed the highest mean back-calculated lengths and annual \n\nincrements at age i among all studied populations. \n\nFish maintained in captivity are most likely under much less stressful conditions \n\nthan those in their degraded natural habitats (e.g. Sousa-Santos et al. 2014a). This seems \n\nto justify the higher growth of the Alcabrichel and Safarujo specimens in captivity and \n\nthe higher fish condition values registered in two of the three persistent pools that were \n\ntarget of restocking actions. However, it does not explain why wild individuals from the \n\nSizandro grew more than the captive ones from the same population. One possible \n\nreason relies on the lower temperatures found in the Campelo Station, where those \n\ncaptive individuals were maintained, as it is known that fish growth is generally \n\nstrongly associated with temperature (e.g. Handeland et al. 2008). The results obtained \n\nfor the Sizandro wild and captive populations must, however, be analysed with caution \n\nsince the sample sizes were small. \n\n5.3. Reproductive behaviour \n\nThe observed four reproductive behaviours were already described by Pereira \n\n(2007) as pre-spawning behaviours, which provided support to the observational data \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\npresented herein and allowed further quantitative analyses. A fifth behaviour described \n\nby Pereira (2007) as \u201cfemale plays dead\u201d was not observed during this study, which \n\nmay be explained by its low frequency of occurrence (reported by the author).  \n\nAs Pereira (2007) conducted her observations with a captive group of 14 \n\nindividuals from the Sizandro population, kept in a 90 L aquarium, the identification of \n\nthe same reproductive behaviours also show that (i) A. occidentale shows a fixed pre-\n\nspawning ethological repertoire; (ii) this repertoire is independent of the scale used, as it \n\nis similar whether the focal group of mature adults is reduced and kept in a small \n\naquarium (as in Pereira 2007) or if the group is composed of hundreds of individuals \n\nkept in a large tank (as in this thesis); and (iii) visual cues will likely be important as \n\nfemale chasing and following by males are the most common components of the pre-\n\nspawning sequence. \n\nThe highest frequencies of the observed reproductive behaviours, in all sampling \n\nperiods, were attained in plants, confirming that these may act as the preferred substrate \n\nfor spawning, as suggested by Pereira (2007). This information highlights the \n\nimportance of accounting for aquatic vegetation when selecting future restocking sites, \n\nwith persistent pools with abundant aquatic vegetation likely displaying higher \n\navailability of proper substrate for spawning. \n\nTemperature and light quantity effects were also evaluated, because both can \n\ninfluence reproductive activity (King 1998 et al. 1998, Boeuf and Le Bail 1999), \n\nnamely by being important for gonad maturation (Sousa-Santos et al. 2014b). Although \n\nno significant associations were found between these two factors and the total frequency \n\nof reproductive behaviours per day, it was evident that the peak of reproductive activity \n\nwas attained after a significant increase of temperature and light, from 7\nth\n\n to 8\nth\n\n May \n\n2015. Whether other external factors may also influence the onset of the reproductive \n\nactivity is still to be evaluated. \n\nAlthough important behavioural data towards the conservation of A. occidentale \n\nwere collected, there were two constraints in this study that should be circumvented in \n\nfurther studies. Specifically, the large volume of the tank (3120 L) did not allow the \n\nvideo recording of the whole study area by the underwater camera. Also, the option for \n\nplacing the camera at fixed sites, although necessary to avoid disturbance and minimize \n\nfish stress, prevented the recording of complete reproductive sequences and spawning \n\nevents which would have been possible to capture if the camera was displaced to follow \n\nthe focal group of fish. Indeed, spawning was only visualized once, during the trial \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nobservations, and although it was clear that the female abdomen was pressured against \n\nthe ground (a behaviour herein described as \u201cPressure\u201d) immediately before the \n\nspawning took place, A. occidentale females are also expected to spawn without being \n\npreviously pressured to a rigid surface (Pereira 2007). The presence of a significantly \n\nhigh number of juveniles in the tank may also have led to an underestimation of \n\nreproductive behaviours, which were only quantified as such when performed by clearly \n\nrecognized mature males and females.  \n\nFuture studies should be conducted in a tank with observation windows that \n\nwould allow for the displacement of the camera by a hidden observer, to follow up the \n\nfocal group of fish. This experimental setup will most likely provide additional data on \n\nthe complete reproductive sequences that culminate in spawning and, more important, \n\non male-female interactions during the courting, pre-spawning, spawning and post-\n\nspawning periods. \n\n \n\n5.4. Final remarks and considerations for the future \n\nThe specific objectives that were put forward for this thesis were accomplished and the \n\nobtained results may be summarized as follows: \n\ni) Summer refugia for A. occidentale consisted in a few small persistent pools in the \n\nmiddle and upper courses of the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers. The \n\nmacrophytes\u2019 coverage was positively associated with fish relative abundance in \n\nsummer refugia; as summer droughts increase the risk of fish loss, the identification \n\nand characterization of summer refugia used by this species provided fundamental \n\nbaseline data to support future decisions and priorities regarding the \n\nimplementation of habitat restoration measures and restocking actions. \n\nii) Along with a population increment, restocking actions conducted at the Alcabrichel \n\nand Sizandro rivers also seem to be responsible for a high representativeness of \n\nyounger age classes in the wild populations. \n\niii) Fish raised in captivity seem to attain older ages, higher condition, larger mean \n\nback-calculated lengths and higher annual increments at age i than in the wild. \n\niv) The reproductive behaviour of A. occidentale involves female chasing by males, \n\nhighlighting the eventual importance of visual cues, and pre-spawning activity \n\noccurs preferably on aquatic plants, independently of the period of the day. \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nIt is crucial that the supportive breeding of endangered species for restocking \n\npurposes is complemented with in situ conservation of the natural habitats, so that the \n\nreleased fish may found favourable conditions to disperse, find food and shelter, spawn \n\nand grow to maturity. As the main goal of this thesis was to provide recommendations \n\nand guidelines for the preservation of A. occidentale in its natural habitats, the gathered \n\ndata allowed for the establishment of some considerations that should be taken into \n\naccount in future restocking and restoration actions:  \n\n(i) Since the water quality in the Alcabrichel, Sizandro and Safarujo rivers is still far \n\nfrom being good, some important habitat restoration and water management \n\nmeasures still need to be conducted in order to preserve summer refugia and, \n\nconsequently, maximize the chances of recovery of A. occidentale populations. To \n\nimprove habitat quality in the pools during the summer, it will be important to \n\ndredge sediments to increase depth; decrease the water temperature and evaporation \n\nrate by increasing instream coverage; limit water abstraction; prevent the discharge \n\nof pollutants; and set up surmountable transversal barriers to naturally improve \n\noxygenation. Also, the eradication of Arundo donax, followed by the restoration of \n\nthe native riparian gallery, would help stabilize the river bank, allowing the \n\nmaintenance of a minimum flow level and providing shelters (e.g. roots of Populus \n\nalba) for juveniles. As dense and uninterrupted longitudinal corridors of A. donax \n\nprevented the access to the water course, especially in the case of the Sizandro \n\nRiver, their removal would also allow for the survey of other persistent pools that \n\ncan act as summer refugia for A. occidentale. These recommendations should be \n\ntaken into account in the delineation of future habitat restoration projects to avoid \n\nthe uncontrolled removal of river bank vegetation, which often results in the \n\ndegradation of summer refugia, including of pools that were already target of \n\nrestocking actions, as was the case of ALC2 (see Appendix VIII); \n\n(ii) In future restocking actions, the fish to be released should be distributed by all the \n\nidentified refugia, according to the water volume and abundance of aquatic \n\nvegetation available at the time in each pool. Precautions must also be taken \n\nregarding fish density in each pool, to avoid overloading pools that do not have the \n\ncapacity to endure a high number of fish; \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n(iii) As the aquatic vegetation seems to be crucial for A. occidentale reproduction and \n\npopulation recruitment, its preservation should be promoted by environmental \n\neducation actions and by providing technical assistance to the city councils in \n\norder to implement carefully designed river cleanup actions. The minimization of \n\nthe erosion by the stabilization of the river banks and the preservation of aquatic \n\nvegetation will contribute to lower levels of water turbidity, which may be crucial \n\nif this species relies on visual cues for female courting by males, as suggested by \n\nthe results obtained in this study. \n\n(iv) Finally, to assess the complete recovery of the three A. occidentale wild \n\npopulations, it is important to survey fish abundance on an annual basis, in order \n\nto evaluate how the species is coping with the stochastic and deterministic \n\nstressors that may eventually compromise its survival. \n\n  \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nAPPENDICES \n \n\nAppendix I.
