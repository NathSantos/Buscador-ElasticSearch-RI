SIAL\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAn original and detailed study focusing the petrography of evaporites from the Late Aptian deposits exposed\n\nin the eastern and southern S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds-Graja\u00fa Basin is presented herein, with the attempt of distinguishing\n\nbetween primary and secondary evaporites, and reconstructing their post-depositional evolution. Seven\n\nevaporites phases were recognized: 1. chevron gypsum; 2. nodular to lensoidal gypsum or anhydrite; 3.\n\nfibrous to acicular gypsum; 4. mosaic gypsum; 5. brecciated gypsum or gypsarenite; 6. pseudo-nodular\n\nanhydrite or gypsum; and 7. rosettes of gypsum. The three first phases of gypsum display petrographic\n\ncharacteristics that conform to a primary nature. The fibrous to acicular and mosaic gypsum were formed\n\nby replacement of primary gypsum, but their origin took place during the eodiagenesis, still under influence\n\nof the depositional setting. These gypsum morphologies are closely related to the laminated evaporites,\n\nserving to demonstrate that their formation was related to replacements that did not affect the primary\n\nsedimentary structures. The pseudo-nodular anhydrite or gypsum seems to have originated by mobilization\n\nof sulfate-rich fluids during burial, probably related to halokinesis. The rosettes of gypsum, which intercept\n\nall the other gypsum varieties, represent the latest phase of evaporite formation in the study area, resulting\n\nfrom either intrastratal waters or surface waters during weathering.\n\nKey words: evaporite, petrography, paleolake, sabkha, Late Aptian, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds-Graja\u00fa Basin.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAncient evaporites are economically important as\n\nsources for salts (e.g., halite and potash) and metals\n\n(e.g., Cu, Zn, Au), and as indicators for structural\n\ntraps of oil and gas (Warren 1999). These deposits\n\nare abundant in sedimentary basins located along\n\nthe Brazilian continental passive margin, being par-\n\nticularly developed in the Aptian-Albian transition\n\n(Hashimoto et al. 1987, Uesugui 1987).

PAZ and DILCE F. ROSSETTI\n\nmation. Such approach concerning to the Aptian\n\nevaporites from the north equatorial Brazilian mar-\n\ngin has not been conducted yet.\n\nA preliminary field investigation showed that\n\nthe evaporites from the Cod\u00f3 Formation include\n\nseveral morphologies, suggesting they might not\n\nbe all primary in origin. Petrographic studies of\n\nevaporites are useful to help deciphering their ori-\n\ngin (e.g., Ogniben 1955, Kerr and Thompson 1963,\n\nHolliday 1970, Arakel 1980, El-Tabakh et al. 1997,\n\nAref 1998), allowing to determine the succession\n\nof events that took place following deposition (e.g.,\n\nArakel 1980, Morad et al. 2000, P\u00e9rez et al. 2002).\n\nThus, this type of study applied to the Cod\u00f3 Forma-\n\ntion might contribute to better define and/or recon-\n\nsider the proposed lacustrine/sabkha system. Deci-\n\nphering the post-depositional history of these evap-\n\norites might help to decide on their potential for\n\nstrontium and sulfur isotopic studies aiming to test\n\nthe hypothesis of a possible marine influence during\n\nsedimentation, as previously proposed elsewhere\n\n(e.g., Rossetti et al. 2000).\n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTING\n\nThe Gondwana split up took place through several\n\nsteps, culminating in the Aptian with the break up\n\nof African and South American continents (G\u00f3es\n\nand Rossetti 2001). This process led to final estab-\n\nlishment of several rift basins along the equatorial\n\nBrazilian margin, where the S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds-Graja\u00fa Basin\n\nis one of the largest, occupying 150,000 km2. This\n\nbasin has been interpreted as a unique structural\n\nfeature formed by combination of pure shear stress\n\nand strike - slip deformation (G\u00f3es and Rossetti\n\n2001). The main rifting developed in the Albian,\n\nwhen fault offsets reached up to 400 m (Figs. 2A,\n\nB), but initial fault displacement gave rise to a shal-\n\nlow and widespread basin where the Cod\u00f3 Forma-\n\ntion was deposited in the Late Aptian. This unit is\n\ndefined at the top by a regionally correlatable un-\n\nconformity marked by an irregular, erosion surface\n\nwith associated paleosol (Paz and Rossetti 2001).\n\nExposures of the Cod\u00f3 Formation include shal-\n\nlowing-upward deposits attributed to lacustrine or\n\nsaline pan-sabkha depositional environments (Paz\n\nand Rossetti 2001, Rossetti et al. 2004; Fig. 3).\n\nIn the Cod\u00f3 area, where a lacustrine system domi-\n\nnates, the shallowing upward cycles consist of bi-\n\ntuminous black shales, evaporites and, subordina-\n\ntely, calcimudstones attributed to central lake depo-\n\nsitional environments. These deposits grade up-\n\nward into gray to green shales and limestones (i.e.,\n\ncalcimudstone, laminated to massive peloidal wa-\n\nckestone to grainstone, and sparstone), related to\n\nintermediate lake environments. The top of the shal-\n\nlowing-upward cycles comprises massive pelite,\n\nshale, limestone (e.g., intraclastic grainstone, ostra-\n\ncodal wackestone to grainstone, ooidal to pisoidal\n\npackstone, tufa) and rhythmite of limestone and\n\nshale. These lithologies display a variety of sedi-\n\nmentary features consistent with marginal lake de-\n\nposition, such as paleosol, karstic surface, fenestrae,\n\nmeteoric cement, vadose pisoid. In the Graj\u00e1u area,\n\na saline pan-sabkha depositional environment was\n\nproposed (Rossetti et al. 2004), being represented\n\nby evaporite and locally tufa, gray-green shale, and\n\ncalcimudstone.\n\nThe evaporite facies consists of laminated\n\ngypsum (formed by alternating darker and lighter\n\ncouplets that are up to 15 cm thick), gypsarenite,\n\nand massive-macronodular gypsum, which record\n\ndeposition in flat lying areas, intraformational re-\n\nworking of previously deposited evaporites, and\n\nremobilization of salts during burial, respectively.\n\nLaminated gypsum occurs in both of the study\n\nareas, dominating in the Graja\u00fa area, while gyp-\n\nsarenite was observed only in the latter. Massive to\n\nmacronodular gypsum is widespread in the Cod\u00f3\n\narea, occurring mostly in the nucleus of evapor-\n\nite lenses that are up to 5 m thick, which enclose\n\nchunks of black bituminous shales. In the Graja\u00fa\n\narea, these deposits form diapiric features that are\n\nup to 6-8 m high at the outcrop scale. The contact\n\nbetween the massive-macrogranular gypsum and\n\nthe laminated gypsum is gradational, except locally\n\nwhere the diapirs are well defined by sharp bound-\n\naries.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\nPETROGRAPHY OF EVAPORITES FROM THE COD\u00d3 FORMATION 559\n\nr\n\n2\u00b0\n\n44\u00b0\n\n4\u00b0\n\n48\u00b0\n\nx\n\nS\u00c3O LU\u00cdS\n\n+\n+\n\nx\n\n70 km\n\n46\u00b0\n\n6\u00b0S\n\nL\nin\n\ne\na\nm\n\ne\nn\nto\n\nR\nio\n\n P\na\nrn\n\na\n\u00edb\n\na\n\n47\u00b0 45\u00b0 43\u00b0W\n\n3\u00b0\n\n5\u00b0\n\nCOD\u00d3\n\nGRAJA\u00daO\n C\n\n E\nA\n\nN\n\nA T L A N T I C\n0\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\nB R A Z I L\n\nBR 226\n\nCOD\u00d3\n\nGRAJA\u00da\n\nBR 316\n\nC\n\nA\n\n50 km\n\nN\n\nB)\n\nD B\n\nSao Lu\u00eds-Graja\u00fa Basin\n\nPalaeozoic rocksProterozoic rocks\n\nA)\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 A) Location map of the study areas in the S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds-Graja\u00fa Basin, northern Brazil. B) A close up map, indicating the location\n\nof the studied sections in the Cod\u00f3 and Graja\u00fa areas.\n\nPETROGRAPHY OF THE EVAPORITES\n\nThe evaporite facies from the Cod\u00f3 Formation\n\nwere characterized petrographically through the\n\nanalysis of 86 thin sections distributed along\n\nfour vertical sections (Fig. 4). Based on morphol-\n\nogy and crystal relationships, eight phases of eva-\n\nporite formation were recognized, which include\n\n(Fig. 5): 1. chevron gypsum; 2. nodular to lensoi-\n\ndal gypsum or anhydrite; 3. acicular gypsum; 4.\n\nmosaic gypsum; 5. brecciated gypsum or gypsare-\n\nnite; 6. pseudo-nodular anhydrite or gypsum; and\n\n7. rosettes of gypsum. In addition to these evapo-\n\nrite phases, an episode of carbonate (calcite/dolo-\n\nmite) cementation or replacement took place in\n\nthese deposits.\n\nCHEVRON GYPSUM\n\nThis type of gypsum was recorded in both of the\n\nstudy areas, being much more widespread in sec-\n\ntions located in the Graja\u00fa area. The chevron gyp-\n\nsum, which represents the lighter component of\n\nthe laminated gypsum facies, was described in a\n\nprevious work, and it forms horizontal beds that\n\nare up to 10 cm thick of vertically aligned crys-\n\ntals. Under microscope, the chevron crystals form\n\ntwin planes and superimposed growth faces with\n\nacute angles arranged as a zig-zag, perpendicularly\n\nto the crystal long axis (Fig. 6A). The chevron crys-\n\ntals usually grew up or are mantled by thin dis-\n\ncontinuous layers of shales (mostly with smectites).\n\nSome thicker layers of chevron gypsum might dis-\n\nplay packages of crystals that slumped down into\n\nthe muds, resulting in a series of segments with\n\nsuperimposed lower concave up shapes.\n\nNODULAR TO LENSOIDAL GYPSUM OR ANHYDRITE\n\nThis evaporite was recorded only in subsurface,\n\noccurring in association with shales. It consists\n\nof either nodules of gypsum or isolated lensoidal\n\ngypsum crystals that are parallel to bedding planes\n\n(Figs. 6B,C). The nodules are up to 5 mm long, and\n\ninternally composed by a dark mixture of anhydrite\n\nand gypsum that form a massive cryptocrystalline\n\nframework.\n\nFIBROUS TO ACICULAR GYPSUM\n\nThis type of gypsum occurs invariably in asso-\n\nciation with chevron gypsum, likewise forming\n\nvertically oriented crystals similar to needles (Fig.\n\n6D).

In this model, the Ferrer-Urbano Santos Arch is considered as an intrabasin\n\nhorst within an abandoned intracontinental rift system formed by combination of pure shear stress and strike-slip deformation. The\n\nnortheastward rifting migration through time gave rise to the development of a deeper basin, represented by the Caet\u00e9 Sub-basin (cf.\n\nG\u00f3es and Rossetti 2001).

Noteworthy\n\nis the frequent presence of relics and/or ghosts of\n\nthe chevron gypsum within the acicular crystals.\n\nMOSAIC GYPSUM\n\nThis type of evaporite occurs particularly within\n\nthe dark bundles of the laminated gypsum. It con-\n\nsists of crystals of gypsum averaging 300\u00b5m in\n\nlength that are arranged into a mosaic framework.\n\nThe contact between crystals is usually ragged and\n\nsutured. The mosaic gypsum typically displays an\n\nabundance of relics of floating anhydrite, forming\n\na poikilitic texture (Fig. 6E).\n\nBRECCIATED GYPSUM TO GYPSARENITE\n\nThis type of evaporite occurs most frequently inter-\n\ngrading with the mosaic gypsum within the darker\n\nbundles of the laminated gypsum facies. It con-\n\nsists of gypsum that occur as clasts ranging from\n\n\u00b5m to 1 cm in diameter (Figs. 7A, B). The clasts\n\nmight be either angular to subangular, when a fitted\n\ntexture is recognized, or rounded, forming locally\n\na texture that is similar to gypsarenite (Figs. 7C).\n\nThe clasts are surrounded by either a continuous or\n\ndiscontinuous dark cutan formed by a mixture of\n\nclay, organic matter and iron oxides. Under crossed\n\npolars, several clasts might display optical continu-\n\nity, forming large crystals that can reach up to 3 mm\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\nPETROGRAPHY OF EVAPORITES FROM THE COD\u00d3 FORMATION 561\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Depositional model proposed for the Cod\u00f3 Formation in the Cod\u00f3 and Graja\u00fa areas (cf. Paz and\n\nRossetti 2001).\n\nof diameter (Fig. 7D). These contain abundant relics\n\nof anhydrite.\n\nPSEUDO-NODULAR ANHYDRITE OR GYPSUM\n\nAt the outcrop scale, this consists of either slightly\n\nelongated or spherical fragments up to 5 cm long\n\nof evaporites displaying a fitted texture (Figs. 8A-\n\nC). Petrographically, the clasts are composed of ala-\n\nbastrine gypsum, fibrous gypsum, and anhydrite. In\n\ngeneral, alabastrine gypsum is the most widespread,\n\noccurring as a mosaic of crystals less than 200\u00b5m\n\nin diameter (Fig. 8D). The crystals are very limpid,\n\ni.e., typically with no inclusions. The fibrous gyp-\n\nsum occurs secondarily as a series of parallel co-\n\nlumns that can reach up to 1 cm long, which grew\n\nwithin the fractures that define the clasts, being per-\n\npendicular to fracture walls (Fig. 8A-C). Unlike to\n\nthe alabastrine, the fibrous gypsum might display\n\nrelics of anhydrite. In addition, ghosts of fibrous\n\ncrystals are locally present within the alabastrine\n\ngypsum (Fig. 8D). In places, some elongated clasts\n\nare composed by microcrystalline lath-like anhy-\n\ndrite (Fig. 8E). Where these clasts are in contact\n\nwith mosaics of large gypsum crystals similar to the\n\nones described above, the latter form concave em-\n\nbayments toward the anhydrites, leaving behind a\n\n\u201cdust\u201d of anhydrite relics (Fig. 8E). Inasmuch, both\n\nthe anhydrite clasts and the mosaic gypsum might\n\ndisplay etched margins as they grade into fibrous\n\nand alabastrine gypsum. Electronic scanning micro-\n\nscopic analysis of the anhydrite clasts reveals a mix-\n\nture of anhydrite and limpid gypsum crystals that are\n\nsimilar to those observed in the nodular to lensoidal\n\ngypsum or anhydrite (Fig. 9A, compare with figure\n\n6C). Noteworthy is that the anhydrite clasts occur\n\nas spots intergraded with alabastrine and fibrous\n\ngypsum.\n\nROSETTES OF GYPSUM\n\nRosettes of amber-colored gypsum are disperse\n\nwithin the evaporites of the Cod\u00f3 area, being re-\n\nstricted to the massive to macronodular gypsum\n\n(Fig. 8C). The rosettes reach up to 5 cm of diam-\n\neter, and consist of fibrous crystals arranged into a\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n562 JACKSON D.S. PAZ and DILCE F.

The rosettes unconformably cut into\n\nall the other gypsum described above.\n\nCarbonates associated with gypsum or anhy-\n\ndrite consist of calcite cement that fill fractures in\n\nthe brecciated gypsum or gypsarenite (Fig. 9B),\n\neven where this facies is obliterated by pseudo-\n\nnodular anhydrite or gypsum. The calcite also oc-\n\ncurs as enlarged crystals that grew upon the gypsum\n\nfrom both sides of the fractures (Fig. 9C), in which\n\ncase it forms caries in the mosaic gypsum. On the\n\nother hand, the alabastrine gypsum enters into relics\n\nof calcite, forming caries toward them (Fig. 9D).\n\nRhombs of calcite after dolomite is locally present\n\n(Fig. 9E). Celestite might be also present in asso-\n\nciation with the carbonates, occurring as pyramidal\n\ncrystals with etched edges.\n\nPARAGENESIS\n\nCombination of facies and petrographic characte-\n\nristics revealed that the foregoing described eva-\n\nporites show features supporting both primary and\n\nsecondary formations. In addition, the petrographic\n\nstudy also showed that at least great part of the sec-\n\nondary gypsum might have been formed under in-\n\nfluence of the depositional surface, thus reflecting\n\nthe original brine characteristics.\n\nEvidence for primary evaporite precipitation\n\nis particularly recorded in the laminated gypsum.\n\nWe interpret that the chevron gypsum is most likely\n\nprimary in origin because they make a pattern, con-\n\nsisting of vertically-aligned upward growing twin\n\ncrystals that are similar, though in a much smaller\n\nscale, to many primary gypsum described in the liter-\n\nature (e.g., Schreiber and Kinsman 1975, Ciarapica\n\net al. 1985, Hovorka 1987, Logan 1987, Handford\n\n1991, Smoot and Lowenstein 1991, Warren 1999).\n\nIn addition, the chevron gypsum is confined to the\n\nlaminated gypsum, defining typical horizontal bed-\n\nding planes. Important to mention also is that this\n\ngypsum forms pairs with the dark (nodular) gyp-\n\nsum, occurring in a very regular way throughout\n\nthe sections, resulting in bundles that probably re-\n\nflect seasonal brine fluctuations. Hence, the chevron\n\ngypsum would have formed under subaqueous con-\n\nditions between the sediment surface and the brine\n\ndue to sulfate saturation (Fig. 10A). Such feature is\n\nattributed to the progressive upward precipitation of\n\nsalts on the floor of shallow (usually less than 2 m\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n564 JACKSON D.S.

This gyp-\n\nsum morphology is similar to satin spar gypsum\n\ncommonly recorded filling fractures in many pub-\n\nlications (e.g., Richardson 1920, Shearman et al.\n\n1972, Mossop and Shearman 1973, Stewart 1979,\n\nGustavson et al. 1994, El-Tabakh et al. 1998). In\n\nthis instance, however, the satin spar gypsum is not\n\nrelated to fractures but it records replacement of\n\nthe chevron gypsum. This is indicated by grada-\n\ntion between these morphologies, and by the fact\n\nthat the satin spar gypsum displays many relics and\n\nghost of chevron gypsum. As replacement took\n\nplace, the beds were slightly deformed, but still\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\nPETROGRAPHY OF EVAPORITES FROM THE COD\u00d3 FORMATION 565\n\nFig. 7 \u2013 Textures of the evaporites from the Cod\u00f3 Formation exposed in the study areas.

Although clear\n\nevidence is lacking, the absence of other types of\n\nsecondary gypsum in the light gypsum beds sug-\n\ngests that such replacement took place shortly after\n\ndeposition, thus still under a strong influence of the\n\nprimary brine. Therefore, despite their authigenic\n\nnature, the satin spar gypsum is considered as a re-\n\nflex of the primary evaporite bedding.\n\nThe satin spar morphology reflects crystal\n\ngrowth from very pure, supersaturated fluids, which\n\nfavored extreme elongation parallel to the c-axis\n\n(Magee 1991). The close association of the acic-\n\nular to fibrous gypsum with the chevron leads to\n\nsuggest that formation fluids were driven from re-\n\nmobilization of sulfates from the chevron gypsum,\n\nwhose formation naturally required high brine sat-\n\nuration. It is important to mention that neither of\n\nthese authigenic processes were enough to destroy\n\nthe primary lamination. This is taken as evidence\n\nto suggest that the formation of mosaic and aci-\n\ncular gypsum took place cyclically and close to\n\nthe depositional surface, just shortly after formation\n\nof the individual bundles.\n\nThe darker laminated gypsum is attributed to\n\ndisplacive growth of crystals beneath brines derived\n\nfrom supersaturated pore fluids in the capillary and/\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n566 JACKSON D.S.

This implies\n\nperiods of descending ground waters and eventual\n\nexposure (e.g., Kerr and Thompson 1963, South-\n\ngate 1982, Warren 1999). Thus, the light and dark\n\ngypsum are taken as products of high and low water\n\nlevel, respectively, which, given the high frequency\n\nand symmetrical distribution along the vertical sec-\n\ntions, are most likely due to seasonal fluctuations\n\n(Figs. 10C-E).\n\nThe cyclic alternation of fibrous gypsum with\n\ndark gypsum containing nodular to lensoidal gyp-\n\nsum or anhydrite is also a reflex of changes in the\n\ndepositional conditions. The formation of these\n\nmorphologies is consistent with deposition taking\n\nplace a few millimeter of the depositional surface\n\nby displacive intrasediment growth of crystals be-\n\nneath the brine from supersaturated pore fluids in\n\nthe capillary and/or upper phreatic zone (e.g., Kerr\n\nand Thomson 1963, Warren 1999).

This is the most common\n\nhabit of gypsum precipitated within the sediments,\n\neither in mudflats or other environments subjected\n\nto palustrine conditions (Magee 1991).\n\nThe presence of nodules composed by a dark\n\nmixture of anhydrite and gypsum forming a mas-\n\nsive cryptocrystalline framework is consistent with\n\nthis interpretation, being related to increased evap-\n\noration, probably due to climatic changes (Rossetti\n\net al. 2004). Similar masses of mixing gypsum\n\nhave been considered as the record of sulfate re-\n\nplacements during seasonal variations next to the\n\ndepositional surface (p.e., Arakel 1980, Mees 1998,\n\nMees and Stoops, 2003).\n\nThe mosaic gypsum was formed by replace-\n\nment of anhydrite, as indicated by the abundant re-\n\nmains of this mineral within it. Mosaics of gyp-\n\nsum crystals with sutured contacts have been in-\n\nterpreted as a non-equilibrium texture of grain in-\n\nterpenetration at low temperature (cf. Voll 1960),\n\nprobably reflecting formation under early diagene-\n\nsis (e.g., Spencer and Lowenstein 1990). The occur-\n\nrence of mosaic gypsum in association with the dark\n\nbundles, alternated with chevron to acicular gypsum\n\nwithin the laminated gypsum, might be taken as ev-\n\nidence of replacement soon after deposition.\n\nExtreme low brine level with subaerial expo-\n\nsure resulted in gypsum fracturing due to desicca-\n\ntion, a process that gave rise to in situ brecciated\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n568 JACKSON D.S. PAZ and DILCE F. ROSSETTI\n\ngypsum and ultimately gypsarenite (Fig. 10E), the\n\nlatter recording local reworking at the surface as\n\nrecorded in other evaporite deposits (e.g., Sanz-\n\nRubio et al. 1999, Schreiber and El Tabakh 2000).\n\nThe frequent upward gradation from the brecciated\n\nto the gypsarenite is consistent with this interpreta-\n\ntion. The presence of mud cutans surrounding the\n\nclasts is attributed either to mechanical infiltration\n\nfrom downward flows or to the adhesion of residues\n\non clast surfaces during reworking.\n\nFollowing brecciation, there was a phase of\n\nwidespread replacement, which gave rise to mo-\n\nsaics of large gypsum crystals affecting the dark\n\nbeds of the laminated gypsum facies. This sequence\n\nof event is proposed based on the observation that\n\nlarge gypsum crystals encompass several clasts,\n\nattesting to pervasive cementation and/or replace-\n\nment. The presence of abundant relics of micro-\n\ncrystalline lath-like anhydrite within the mosaics\n\nattests to their origin following a period of anhydrite\n\nformation. Noteworthy is the fact that the mosaics\n\nwere developed only in the darker bundles of the\n\nlaminated gypsum, not affecting the lighter compo-\n\nnents. Instead, the chevron gypsum was replaced,\n\nas previously mentioned, by fibrous and acicular\n\ngypsum.\n\nFracturing at the surface created porous, which\n\nwere cemented by calcite. Calcite also replaced\n\ngypsum near the fracture sides. Under subaerial\n\nconditions (i.e., vadose to freshwater phreatic), sul-\n\nfate-undersaturated pore fluids dissolve gypsum\n\nand/or anhydrite and release Ca2+ for precipitation\nof calcite as the CO2?3 has more affinity with cal-\ncium than with SO2?4 (cf. Back et al. 1983). Rare\ndolomite rhombs might have been formed either\n\nby replacement of calcite or simultaneous dolomite\n\nprecipitation. The dolomite was in turn replaced by\n\ncalcite. Dedolomitization is closely linked to karsti-\n\nfication (Ca\u00f1averas et al. 1996). This process might\n\nhave contributed to release Sr2+, which combined\nwith SO2?4 , promoted precipitation of celestite (cf.\nOlaussen 1981, Taberner et al. 2002). The celestite\n\nformation, in turn, also releases Ca2+ that increases\nthe Ca/Mg ratio, and could have dissolved dolomite\n\nFig. 10 \u2013 A model explaining the formation of the light and dark\n\nbundles in the laminated gypsum facies, as well as brecciated\n\ngypsum or gypsarenite. A) Brine concentration led to growth\n\nof vertically-aligned chevron gypsum in the interface between\n\nthe sediment and the brine. B) During low water level, sulfate-\n\nrich descending flows resulted in the origin of displacive gypsum,\n\nforming nodular to lensoidal gypsum or anhydrite within the sed-\n\niment. C) Renewed phase of higher water level promoted mud\n\ndeposition. D) The increase in salt concentration due to evapora-\n\ntion gave rise to a renewed phase of fibrous gypsum formation. E)\n\nExtreme evaporation led to the eventual subaerial exposure of the\n\ndepositional surface, brecciation and reworking of previously de-\n\nposited evaporites, with the consequent formation of brecciated\n\ngypsum or gypsarenite facies.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\nPETROGRAPHY OF EVAPORITES FROM THE COD\u00d3 FORMATION 569\n\nand renewed calcite precipitation (p.e., Back et al.\n\n1983, Kushnir 1985). The close association of cal-\n\ncite, dolomite and celestite in the studied evaporites\n\nof the Cod\u00f3 Formation suggests these processes as\n\nthe most likely.\n\nThe pseudonodular anhydrite or gypsum is in-\n\nterpreted to represent a later phase of gypsum for-\n\nmation. First, this is suggested by its occurrence\n\nrestricted to the massive to macronodular gypsum,\n\nwhere primary sedimentary structures were almost\n\nentirely lost. The presence of massive gypsum\n\ngrading into the laminated gypsum, and the diapiric\n\ngeometry enclosing chunks of black bituminous\n\nshales is related to salt remobilization during halo-\n\nkinesis. Second, the pseudonodular anhydrite or\n\ngypsum contains limpid alabastrine and fibrous\n\ncrystals, not observed in association with the lami-\n\nnated gypsum, which is consistent with the proposed\n\nlate formation. Fine crystalline gypsum have been\n\nconsidered as secondary in origin (Holliday 1970),\n\nforming in consequence of hydration, especially of\n\nanhydrite, induced by diapirism or other mechanism\n\nthat allow percolation of water through evaporite\n\nrocks (Holliday 1970, Warren 1999). Fracturing\n\nseems to have been the cause of the pseudonodu-\n\nlar aspect of this gypsum. Under stress, probably\n\nrelated to salt remobilization, part of the gypsum\n\nmight have had a ruptile behavior, ultimately break-\n\ning apart to form individual fragments (e.g., Marco\n\net al. 2002). Saturated fluids percolating along the\n\nsecondary porosity created by this process would\n\nhave promoted precipitation of the fibrous gypsum.\n\nIn the following, there might have had the enlar-\n\ngement of the fractures due to forcing caused by\n\ncrystal growth. While this process took place, most\n\nof the primary sedimentary features, as well as the\n\nprevious phases of evaporites, became obliterated.\n\nAs the salt became mobile, there was a pervasive\n\ndevelopment of alabastrine gypsum. The later na-\n\nture of this phase of gypsum is revealed by its limpid\n\naspect, free of anhydrite inclusions, and by the fact\n\nthat it contains ghosts of fibrous gypsum.\n\nThe spots with microcrystalline lath-like anhy-\n\ndrite that occur within the macronodular gypsum is\n\nprobably a relic of one of the earliest phase of evap-\n\norite precipitation in the study area. The paragen-\n\nesis reconstituted with basis on petrographic rela-\n\ntionships shows that these anhydrites form nodules\n\nthat were in part replaced by the mosaic gypsum,\n\nas revealed by the fact that the later form concave\n\nembayments that enter into the anhrydrite. The mar-\n\ngins of this gypsum are, in turn, ragged due to re-\n\naction with fibrous and alabastrine gypsum. These\n\nrelationships support that the anhydrite nodules\n\nhad an early development relative to all other gyp-\n\nsum phases present in the pseudonodular gypsum.\n\nIf so, then it is possible that the anhydrite is tem-\n\nporally related to the anhydrite formed in the dark\n\nbundles of the laminated gypsum, which represents\n\none of the earliest evaporite phases developed in the\n\nCod\u00f3 Formation.\n\nThe final phase of evaporite formation is re-\n\ncorded by the rosettes of gypsum, as confirmed by\n\nthe fact that these truncate all the other evaporite\n\nmorphologies. Aggregates of large fibrous gypsum\n\ncrystals forming rosettes similar to the ones of the\n\nstudy area have been attributed to the action of ei-\n\nther intrastratal waters during burial or surficial wa-\n\nters during weathering (e.g., Shearman 1966, Holl-\n\niday 1970, Warren 1999).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nDespite the many varieties of evaporites recorded\n\nin the Cod\u00f3 Formation exposed in the eastern and\n\nsouthern margin of the Graja\u00fa Basin, these deposits\n\ndisplay many petrographic and faciological attri-\n\nbutes that are consistent with an early formation, ei-\n\nther by primary precipitation or early replacements\n\nwhen the sediments were still under influence of\n\nthe depositional surface. These types of evapor-\n\nites prevail particularly in the Graja\u00fa area, where\n\nlaminated gypsum facies dominates. In both areas,\n\nburial phases of gypsum seem to have developed\n\nonly where gypsum was remobilized during halo-\n\nkinesis.\n\nThe lack of significant deep diagenetic modi-\n\nfication of the Cod\u00f3 Formation is recorded also by\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2006) 78 (3)\n\n\n\n570 JACKSON D.S. PAZ and DILCE F. ROSSETTI\n\nstudies focusing the limestones and shales interbed-\n\nded with the evaporites. The limestones are domi-\n\nnated by calcimudstones and peloidal wackestones\n\nor packstones with only local evidences of cementa-\n\ntion or replacement. These lithologies usually dis-\n\nplay primary features, as normal grading and hori-\n\nzontal crenulated lamination. Inasmuch, the shales\n\nassociated with the evaporites consist almost en-\n\ntirely of smectite, with only subordinate kaolinite\n\nand illite. Among these clay minerals, smectite is\n\nfar the dominant one, being represented by detri-\n\ntal flakes, while the kaolinite and illite are mostly\n\nauthigenic, being related to pedogenetic horizons\n\n(D.G. de-Freitas, unpublished data). These data are\n\nconsistent with the proposition that burial did not\n\ncause significant textural or mineralogical modifi-\n\ncation of the Cod\u00f3 Formation.\n\nThe petrographic studies presented here\n\nstrongly motivate to undertake isotopic studies in\n\nthe evaporites of the Cod\u00f3 Formation. The analy-\n\nsis should be carried out using samples from the\n\nlaminated facies only, which preserves evaporites\n\nformed both primarily and shortly after deposition,\n\nproviding information on original brine characteris-\n\ntics. On the other hand, the pseudo-nodular anhy-\n\ndrite or gypsum and the rosettes of gypsum should\n\nnot be considered for this type of studies, as they\n\nrepresent later stages of gypsum formation due to\n\ndeeper salt remobilization. Inasmuch, the spots of\n\nanhydrite within the pseudo-nodular anhydrite or\n\ngypsum should be also discarded in these analy-\n\nses. Despite the interpretation that these evaporites\n\nmight have formed contemporaneously to the early-\n\nformed nodular to lensoidal anhydrite, the micro-\n\nscopic studies revealed they were strongly replaced\n\nby limpid, alabastrine gypsum, being inappropriate\n\nfor isotopic analysis that can be used for paleoenvi-\n\nronmental purposes.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe Itapicuru Agroindustrial S/A is acknowledged\n\nfor the permission to access the quarries with the\n\nexposures of the Cod\u00f3 Formation.
