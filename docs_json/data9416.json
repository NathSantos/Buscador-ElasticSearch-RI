GOMES, ANDR\u00c9 DANDERFER FILHO,\nANA MARIA A. POSADA and ANIELLE C. DA SILVA\n\nUniversidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Escola de Minas, Departamento de Geologia, Morro do Cruzeiro, s/n\n35400-000 Ouro Preto, MG, Brasil\n\nManuscript received on May 5, 2009; accepted for publication on June 22, 2010\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe style of deformation of rocks from basin-infilling sequences in positively inverted natural basins was discussed\n\nupon the results of laboratory experiments carried out in sandboxes with sand packs laid down in the space between\n\ntwo wooden blocks. The space simulated stages of crustal extension leading to (1) a half graben due to extension above\n\na listric extensional detachment, with the blocks simulating the footwall and hanging wall, or (2) a graben, with the\n\nblocks simulating the external margins that drifted apart above a horizontal detachment. Combinations of two different\n\nangles were used to simulate the dip of curved normal faults along the internal face of the wooden blocks. Backstops in\n\nthe half graben had a convex up internal face. Backstops in the graben had a concave up internal face. Shortening was\n\npartitioned in forward and backward movements within the sand packs, and the kinematics of contraction was largely\n\ninfluenced by the convex or concave internal faces. A buttress effect characterized by rotation of the sand pack close to\n\nthe footwall was stronger for footwall with steeper-dipping internal faces. The results were compared to other physical\n\nexperiments and applied to an inverted basin found in nature.\n\nKey words: analogue models, backstop geometry, buttress effect, inversion tectonics, normal detachment reactivation.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe geometry and tectonic features of inverted basins\n\nhave been described since the beginning of the century.\n\nHowever, the formal definition of \u2018inversion\u2019 was only\n\npresented in 1981 by Glennie and Boegner (1981).\n\nAccording to these authors, \u2018inversion\u2019 represents the\n\nreversal of the regional stress regime, from extension\n\nto contraction, or the opposite. Cooper et al. (1989) sug-\n\ngest that the inversion process should involve: basin\n\nformation by normal faulting, sedimentation and sub-\n\nsequent compression or transpression causing uplift\n\nand partial extrusion of the basin infill.\n\nInversion in orogenic belts involves deformation\n\nof continental margin prisms and is normally character-\n\nized by thin- and thick-skinned thrust sheets and nappes.\n\nCorrespondence to: Caroline Janette Souza Gomes\nE-mail: caroline@degeo.ufop.br\n\nThis inversion style produces major crustal shortening\n\nand was discussed by several authors dealing with fore-\n\nland fold-thrust belts such as the Appalachians, the\n\nRocky Mountains, the Alps and the Himalayas (respec-\n\ntively in Mitra 1988, de Graciansky et al. 1989, Hay-\n\nward and Graham 1989, Jadoon et al. 1994).\n\nAccording to Glen et al. (2005), three different tec-\n\ntonic models may be used to reproduce inversion: a)\n\nthe fault-reactivation model; b) the thin-skinned model;\n\nand c) the buttress model. The first model postulates\n\nthat reactivation preferentially occurs along faults that\n\nhave the lowest dip angle or the lowest resistance to for-\n\nward movement. In the \u2018thin-skinned model\u2019, inversion\n\ndevelops by the formation of new thrust faults rather\n\nthan by reactivation of pre-existent normal faults. Fi-\n\nnally, in the \u2018buttress model\u2019, inversion is controlled by\n\nthe rheologic contrast between the basement and syn-\n\nrift sedimentary sequences. According to Butler (1989)\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2010) 82 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2010/11/5 \u2014 18:21 \u2014 page 998 \u2014 #2\n\n998 CAROLINE J.S. GOMES, ANDR\u00c9 DANDERFER FILHO, ANA MARIA A. POSADA and ANIELLE C. DA SILVA\n\nand Hayward and Graham (1989), the basement, either\n\nin the hanging wall or in the footwall of the extensional\n\ndetachment, may produce buttressing structures in the\n\nsyn-rift sequence either by folding and associated cleav-\n\nages, rotation in the foreland or backward propagating\n\ndisplacements.\n\nDespite several analogue experiments have demon-\n\nstrated how do structures progressively develop during\n\ninversion, according to the fault-reactivation and the\n\nthin-skinned models (respectively McClay 1995, 1989),\n\nthe buttress effect does not appear to have been conve-\n\nniently addressed, and we think that the geometry of the\n\nbackstop may play a fundamental role in the deforma-\n\ntion pattern of the basin infill, as well as in the reacti-\n\nvation of the basal detachment. Thus, we carried out a\n\nseries of analogue experiments in sandboxes in order to\n\nanalyze the buttressing effects (rotation in the foreland\n\nand/or backward propagating movement) and the con-\n\nditions of reactivation of the normal detachment. We\n\nlabel as backstop the rigid mass that moves on the basal\n\ndetachment to cause contraction of the basin-infilling se-\n\nquences, whereas the term buttress refers to a rigid mass\n\nthat restrains the dislocation of the thrust sheets. Both\n\nthe backstop and the buttress have the ability to sup-\n\nport larger deviatoric stresses than the basin-infilling se-\n\nquences.\n\nIn the evolution of orogenic wedges, backstops (or\n\nindenters) have been described both in analogue (e.g.,\n\nMulugeta 1988, Bonini et al. 1999) and numerical\n\nmodels (e.g., Byrne et al. 1993, Beaumont et al. 1994).\n\nByrne et al. (1993) consider a backstop as a structural\n\ndomain that bears strong differential stresses and gener-\n\nates a deformation front similar to a bulldozer pushing\n\nfrom behind an accretionary wedge. According to these\n\nauthors, a backstop plays a key role in the geometry of an\n\naccretionary wedge on a subduction zone. A foreland-\n\ndipping backstop for instance causes, among other fea-\n\ntures, the growth of a high outer arc and thrust vergence\n\ninversion.\n\nIn our study, we described analogue models in\n\nwhich the deformable hanging wall of a basin is inverted\n\nby stiff, convex-up and concave-up backstops (Fig. 1).\n\nThe convex-up and concave-up geometries refer to the\n\ncurvature of the foreland-dipping face of the backstop\n\nthat is unconformably covered by the basin infill (Fig. 1i\n\nand 1ii, respectively). The convex-up backstop simu-\n\nlates the hanging wall block above a listric extensional\n\ndetachment (Fig. 1i); the concave-up backstop simu-\n\nlates any of the two margins of a graben; in other words,\n\nit is a block that can be moved on a horizontal detach-\n\nment (Fig. 1ii). In addition, we investigated the effect\n\nof two different angles of dip for the foreland-dipping\n\nface of the backstop and the rigid block (termed nor-\n\nmal footwall block) on the style of deformation of the\n\nbasin infill.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENTS\n\nSCALING\n\nFor the analogue experiments to be valid, model pa-\n\nrameters must be properly scaled. Hubbert (1937) es-\n\ntablished scaling relationships between the geometric,\n\nkinematic, and dynamic properties of the models and\n\nthe corresponding properties of the geological counter-\n\nparts. The scale of model-prototypes is determined by\n\nthree basic parameters: length, time and mass. For geo-\n\nmetrically and kinematically similar structures, the dy-\n\nnamic similarity requires that the ratio between forces in\n\nmodel and prototype must be constant if compared kind\n\nto kind. From this condition follows another one: the\n\nratio between two dissimilar forces in the model must\n\nbe equal to the ratio between the same two forces in the\n\nprototype. For our purpose, the most significant force\n\nratio is gravity force (Fg) / pressure force (Fp), written\n\nas follows:\n\n?l 3g /1? \u00d7 l 2 or ?lg /1? (1)\n\nwhere, ? = rock density, l = length, g = gravity on Earth\n\nsurface, and 1? = rock strength. From the above re-\n\nquirement and expression (1) follows that\n\n(\n?lg/1?\n\n)\nmodel\n\n=\n(\n?lg/1?\n\n)\nprototype\n\n(2)\n\nOnce the density of the materials has little influence in\n\nthe solution of equations 1 and 2, and the gravity field\n\nin experiments and nature is the same, equation 2 can be\n\nrewritten as\n\n(l/1? )model = (l/1? )prototype or\n\nlmodel / lprototype = 1?model /1?prototype.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2010) 82 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2010/11/5 \u2014 18:21 \u2014 page 999 \u2014 #3\n\nTHE BACKSTOP SHAPE DURING BASIN INVERSION 999\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Conceptual cartoon showing the authors idea for the positive inversion of a half graben (i) and a graben (ii) by sliding a mobile block\n\nabove listric or horizontal basal detachments, respectively.

(1) basement; (2) syn-rift 1; (3) syn-rift 2; (4) convex-up backstop, and (5) concave-up backstop during inversion.\n\nThus, if the length in the model is decreased by a scale\n\nfactor ? = 10?5, the ratio of cohesive strength ?r must\n\nbe decreased also by 10?5. Equation 2 justifies the use\n\nof dry sand as analogue material in several experiments,\n\nbecause a reduction of the original by 100.000 times re-\n\nquires that the analogue material has cohesive strength\n\nclose to zero.\n\nThe cohesive strength of sand has been subject of\n\ndiscussion. A common method used to estimate the\n\nstrength of sand under low normal stresses consists of\n\na linearly extrapolation from measurements made at\n\nhigher values, yielding a wide range of results between\n\n12 and 500 Pa. Eisenstadt and Sims (2005) noted that\n\nthe cohesive strength of sand is low but increases with\n\nhigher levels of ambient humidity. They evaluated sand\n\nand clay models used to simulate deformation in brit-\n\ntle rocks and concluded that neither is perfect for scaled\n\nmodeling, but both reproduce remarkably well the defor-\n\nmation patterns of the upper crust. In our scaled models,\n\nwe selected quartz sand as analogue material due to its\n\nease of construction and dissection.\n\nSand is considered to behave as a Mohr-Coulomb\n\nmaterial similar to the upper brittle crust that implies a\n\nfriction angle of about 30? and a time-independent de-\n\nformation. Therefore, the ratio between length and time\n\nis an independent ratio, enabling us to choose a suitable\n\nratio for our experiments. The models were deformed\n\nby displacing the mobile wall, driven by a motor, at a\n\nrate of 2 \u00d7 10?3 cm/s (2 cm/h). The adopted scale fac-\n\ntor was 10?5 and, consequently, a 5-cm height in the\n\nmodel represented 5 km of brittle crust in the prototype.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SET-UP\n\nOur experiments were carried out at the Laboratory\n\nof Tectonic Modelling of the Department of Geology,\n\nFederal University of Ouro Preto (Brazil). During lab-\n\noratory work, 16 series of experiments were performed\n\nin order to study the effect of mobile backstop curvature\n\non contraction and on positive inversion, with variable\n\ninitial lengths. Only the positive inversion deformation\n\nexperiments are presented and discussed here. In the\n\nsandboxes, the space between the backstop and the nor-\n\nmal footwall was filled with fine layers of sand of dif-\n\nferent colors (sand pack 1, Fig. 2). The models were\n\n5 cm deep, 20 cm wide, and the initial length between\n\nthe rigid backstop toe and the rigid normal detachment\n\nfootwall toe was 14 cm. All experiments were run in\n\ntwo successive steps.

At the end of\n\nthe extension, the top surface of the experiment was cov-\n\nered with an additional thin horizontal layer to visual-\n\nize the compressional deformation. In the second step,\n\nthe extensional basin was submitted to a 12-cm contrac-\n\ntion (60%). Therefore, the final length between back-\n\nstop and normal footwall toe was 8 cm.\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 Schematic illustrations of the experimental apparatus for se-\n\nquence 1 (in sequences 2 and 3 the backstop is concave-up and vertical,\n\nrespectively). (i) Apparatus before extension, and (ii) apparatus after\n\nextension and before inversion. Sand pack 1 represents the rift infill\n\nduring the oldest extension event (also named syn-rift 1) (not simu-\n\nlated), and sand pack 2 represents the syn-rift deposit of the second\n\nextension event (also named syn-rift 2) \u2013 our first deformation step. ?\n\nand ? are the backstop and the normal footwall cut-off angles, respec-\n\ntively.\n\nThree experimental sequences were set up, and in\n\ntwo of them we changed the backstop curvature, from\n\nconvex upward (sequence 1) to concave upwards (se-\n\nquence 2). In these sequences, the backstop cut-off an-\n\ngle (?) and the normal footwall cut-off angle (?) were\n\neither 60? or 70?, which are the angles usually found in\n\nnature (models 1-8, Table I). Sequence 3 consisted of\n\ntwo experiments (9 and 10) with a plane, vertical mobile\n\nwall in order to compare the results with traditional ex-\n\nperiments (e.g., Buchanan and McClay 1991). In these\n\nexperiments, backstops were not characterized by any\n\nspecific lithology or geological body, and may be under-\n\nstood as the result of lateral increase in strength com-\n\npared to the foreland.\n\nFor all experiments (Table I), the layers of colored\n\nhomogenous sand were deposited on a plastic sheet that\n\nsimulates a low friction basal detachment (normal de-\n\ntachment D2; Fig. 2i). The plastic sheet overlays the\n\nwooden normal footwall and passes under the backstop\n\nwhere it was attached. Prior to inversion, the plastic\n\nsheet was detached from the mobile wall, but remained\n\nin the experimental box to simulate a possible reactiva-\n\ntion of the normal detachment (detachment D2 = D3,\n\nFig. 2ii). Photographs that were taken through the trans-\n\nparent sidewalls recorded the evolution of the structures\n\nat regular intervals. In addition, at the end of the in-\n\nversion, the sand models were strengthened by infusion\n\nwith water, then cut and photographed. We observed that\n\nfriction between the sand and the glass sides caused a\n\nminor slip of the fault-blocks at the sidewalls with re-\n\nspect to the sand pack center. This means that the lateral\n\nshear stress actually interferes with the model evolution,\n\nbut it does not modify the overall structural architecture.\n\nEXPERIMENT LIMITATIONS\n\nBecause our experiments involve some simplifications,\n\nthey have limitations that require a critical analysis, such\n\nas physical modelling experiments in general. A limita-\n\ntion of our analogue experiments relates to the material\n\ndiscontinuity between sand packs 1 and 2 and the wooden\n\nblocks simulating the backstop and the normal footwall.\n\nSand packs 1 and 2 are mechanically equal. The physi-\n\ncal discontinuity produced a mechanically defined basal\n\ndetachment that highly controlled the deformation tra-\n\njectory. In natural structures, fluid pressure may greatly\n\nenhance reactivation by lowering resistance along the\n\nfault zone. Cobbold et al. (2001) demonstrated that the\n\nstyle of deformation in sandboxes could be partially con-\n\ntrolled by the amount of fluid pressure. However, pore\n\nfluid pressure effects were not taken into account in our\n\nexperiments. We believe that the main potential of phys-\n\nical modelling is to provide a visual image of progressive\n\ndeformation under different combinations of controlling\n\nparameters, while in the real world only the final defor-\n\nmation product is available.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2010) 82 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2010/11/5 \u2014 18:21 \u2014 page 1001 \u2014 #5\n\nTHE BACKSTOP SHAPE DURING BASIN INVERSION 1001\n\nTABLE I\nSummary of boundary conditions of our 10 experiments.\n\n? ?\n\n60\u00b0 60\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0 70\u00b0\n\n70\u00b0 60\u00b0\n        \n\n70\u00b0 70\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0 60\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0 70\u00b0\n\n70\u00b0 60\u00b0\n\n           \n\n        \n\n70\u00b0 70\u00b0\n\n60\u00b0 90\u00b0\n\n&lt;60\u00b0 90\u00b0\n\nFinally, our experiments did not account for po-\n\ntential thermal effects, compaction and isostatic adjust-\n\nment. Some other limitations involve constant extension\n\nand convergence angle, and rate of deformation. In na-\n\nture, variations in both parameters may affect the geo-\n\nmetry of the structures and the mechanics involved in\n\ntheir formation.\n\nOur simplified approach is justified by the purpose\n\nof providing basic guides for understanding inversion\n\ntectonics when basin closure is caused by stiff, convex-\n\nup and concave-up backstops.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFor all experiments presented below, we described pro-\n\ngressive deformation stages of one extensional experi-\n\nment (model 1) and two inversion models: one convex-\n\nup (again model 1) and one concave-up (model 6) mo-\n\nbile backstop sequence.

Characteristic features in sand pack 1\n\n(syn-rift 1) are a gentle flexure in the hanging wall after\n\n14,3% (2 cm) of extension (Fig. 3ii), and the successive\n\ndevelopment of normal faults to form a crestal collapse\n\ngraben within the roll-over anticline (Figs. 3iii-iv).

After 20% of shortening (4 cm), a box\n\nfold-type structure has developed next to the backstop\n\nwith limbs corresponding to a forethrust (F1) and a back-\n\nthrust (B1). With the progressive deformation (40% =\n\n8 cm), the sand wedge was pushed up and carried back-\n\nward (to the right) up the backthrust B1, and a second\n\nforethrust (F2) developed when slip on forethrust F1\n\nceased.\n\nAfter 60% of shortening (12 cm) (Fig. 4iv), the\n\nbox fold became an asymmetric ramp anticline onto the\n\nconvex-up backstop, because the compressional fault\n\nsystem (F1 + F2) was carried up and backward relative\n\nto the movement of the backstop. Such movement gave\n\norigin to forethrust F3 that formed right at the toe of the\n\nbackstop and increased deformation of the crestal col-\n\nlapse graben. The sand pack 2 (syn-rift 2) thickened\n\nslightly nearby the footwall and started to be pushed up\n\nand out of the half graben, but the basal detachment did\n\nnot reactivate. The crestal collapse graben fault system\n\nwas cut by forethrust 2 and 3 and underwent rotation and\n\nnarrowing (Fig. 4iv).\n\nEnd results: Models 1 to 4\n\nFigure 5 presents the profile line drawings of the cen-\n\ntral region of models 1 to 4, at final shortening. In all\n\nthe experiments, at least three forethrusts cut the normal\n\nfaults in the foreland, and a major rotation of the crestal\n\ncollapse graben system occurred.\n\nThe main difference between models 1 and 3 (?\n\n= 60?) and models 2 and 4 (? = 70?) concerns to the\n\ndeformation in the sand pack close to the backstop. In\n\nthe latter, the high backstop angle produced after 40%\n\nof shortening (not shown) a second backthrust (B2) be-\n\nlow the first one. The difference between models 1 and 2\n\n(? = 60?) and 3 and 4 (? = 70?) concerns to the amount\n\nof counterclockwise rotation of the syn-rift sand pack 1\n\nclose to the footwall (Figs. 5 and 6i). Such rotation is\n\nthe greatest in experiment 4, in which the internal face of\n\nboth the normal footwall and the backstop dip steeply.\n\nReactivation of the normal detachment did not oc-\n\ncur in any of the experiments, because the backstop geo-\n\nmetry allows an intense backward movement of the sand\n\nwedge. Consequently, all profiles showed a ramp anti-\n\ncline on the backstop, the hinges varying from rounded\n\n(experiments 1 and 3) to flattened (experiments 2 and\n\n4). Excepting experiment 1, both the backward displace-\n\nment (termed S) on the backstop flat and the ratio be-\n\ntween S and the fold amplitude (A) were almost constant\n\n(Figs. 7i and 8i).\n\nINVERSION EXPERIMENTS WITH A CONCAVE-UP\n\nMOBILE BACKSTOP\n\nInversion steps \u2013 Model 6 (? = 70? and ? = 60?)\n\nThe concave-up backstop caused a deformation trajec-\n\ntory different from that observed for the convex-up back-\n\nstop. Most of the deformation was accommodated by\n\nthe rise and backward movement of the sand wedge rel-\n\native to the transport of the backstop, which produced\n\na pronounced ramp anticline (Fig. 9). After 20% of\n\nshortening (4 cm), forethrust F1 appears (and backthrust\n\nB1), and after 40% of shortening (8 cm), forethrust\n\nF2 is formed together with a second backthrust (B2).\n\nThrust F2 cuts normal fault E1. After 50% of short-\n\nening (10 cm) (not shown), F2 becomes locked, and as\n\na consequence, the normal detachment is reactivated\n\n(Fig. 9 iv). In this process, the crestal collapse graben\n\nbecomes narrower.\n\nEnd results: Models 5 to 8\n\nThe line drawings of profiles across the center of ex-\n\nperiments 5 to 8 are presented in figure 10. Due to the\n\nlarger area between the two wooden blocks, the move-\n\nment of the concave-up backstops produces a less intense\n\ndeformation in this sequence. Rotation of the crestal col-\n\nlapse graben system is small, and with the exception of\n\nmodel 8, only two thrust faults are observed. Backthrusts\n\nformed at the right side of the model. In model 8, fore-\n\nthrust F3 extends to the syn-rift sand pack 2 cutting the\n\nnormal fault E3 after a short dislocation parallel to it.\n\nClose to fault F3, two backthrusts of minor expression\n\nare formed at the base of the sand wedge.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2010) 82 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2010/11/5 \u2014 18:21 \u2014 page 1003 \u2014 #7\n\nTHE BACKSTOP SHAPE DURING BASIN INVERSION 1003\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 (i-iv) Sequential line drawings of extensional steps of photographs that were taken through the transparent sidewalls of model 1 (? and ?\n\n= 60?) showing normal fault sequence E1-E3.\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 (i-iv) Sequential line drawings of inversional steps of photographs taken through the transparent sidewalls of model 1 (? and ? =\n\n60?).

As in the case of the\n\ninversion experiment with a convex-up mobile backstop,\n\nthe steeper normal detachment cut-off angle in models 7\n\nand 8 caused a pronounced counterclockwise rotation of\n\nthe syn-rift sand pack 1 (Fig. 6ii).

The sense of the horizontal displace-\n\nment depends on the morphology, dip angle and height\n\nof the adjacent blocks, particularly of the backstop.\n\nFigure 13 compares deformation in the 60?-dipping\n\nfootwall models (models 1, 5, 9 and 10) with the vari-\n\nable geometry of the backstop at final shortening (60%).\n\nThe results reveal that all models with SPH = BH, in-\n\ndependent of the backstop geometry, generated a back-\n\nward movement, and the magnitude of movement is con-\n\ntrolled by the backstop geometry. The backward move-\n\nment is smaller when the backstop is vertical, and big-\n\nger when concave. In both experiments with vertical\n\nbackstops (Figs. 13iii and iv), a strong normal detach-\n\nment reactivation is noticed (from 20% shortening on),\n\nwhereas in experiments with curved backstop, only the\n\nmodels with concave-up backstop produced reactivation\n\n(starting at 40% of shortening). Moreover, at the end of\n\nthe deformation, the height of the deformed sand pack\n\nis almost the same in all experiments (Figs. 13i-iv), dif-\n\nfering only in the back- and forward slip magnitudes.\n\nIt is important to stress out that none of the crestal col-\n\nlapse graben normal faults underwent reactivation in our\n\nmodels. Excepting models 5, 9 and 10, these faults are\n\ntransected by the forethrusts.\n\nFig. 13 \u2013 Models (i) 1, (ii) 5, (iii) 9 and (iv) 10, with the same 60?-\n\ndipping footwall but with different backstop geometries for comparison\n\nof thrust patterns.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2010) 82 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2010/11/5 \u2014 18:21 \u2014 page 1008 \u2014 #12\n\n1008 CAROLINE J.S.

DA SILVA\n\nFinally, the models demonstrated that the combined\n\neffect of the normal footwall stiffness and the high dip\n\nangle (70?) of the bounding normal detachment causes\n\na buttress effect by rotation of the syn-rift pack close\n\nto the extensional detachment (models 3, 4, 7 and 8).\n\nGraphics in Figure 6 demonstrate that, in models 1, 2, 5\n\nand 6 (? = 60?, Table I), the angle between layering in\n\nthe sand pack and the normal detachment (angle ? shown\n\nin the inset of Fig. 6) stayed low during all the inversion\n\nsteps (between 29? and 34?), while in experiments 3, 4,\n\n7, and 8 (? = 70?, Table I), the angle ? started close to\n\n40?, and in models 4 and 8 the sand pack rotated coun-\n\nterclockwise for nearly 10?.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL MODELS\n\nAND WITH A GEOLOGICAL EXAMPLE\n\nThe backstop\n\nMulugeta and Koyi (1987) and Gomes (1996) discussed\n\nthe effect of a vertical mobile wall on the compressive\n\nstructures in sand models. The vertical and stiff wall\n\ncauses strong ejection of the analogue material close to\n\nthe backstop, together with backthrusting and vertical-\n\nization of the older compressive faults as well, as a pro-\n\ngressive decrease in the spacing between the thrust faults.\n\nRossetti et al. (2002), among others, studied, by\n\nmeans of thermomechanical laboratory experiments,\n\nthe formation of accretionary wedges (traction-reversal\n\nmodels) in subduction zones, varying the backstop geo-\n\nmetry and convergence velocities. The authors used vis-\n\ncous paraffin (T ? 37?) to simulate the crust, and demon-\n\nstrated that the above factors controlled the position of\n\nthe axial ridge of the wedge and the propagation of the\n\ndeformation front.\n\nBonini et al. (1999) described physical sand mod-\n\nels and demonstrated that indenters (or backstops) with\n\na low-angle (? 60?) ramp geometry cause upward and\n\nbackward movement of sand packs. Indenters with 60?-\n\ndipping ramps cause the formation of isolated back-\n\nthrusts, and in experiments with steeper ramp angles\n\n(> 60?), the backward movement occurs on backthrusts\n\nrather than along the backstop. Continuous displace-\n\nment results in the formation of thrusts with double ver-\n\ngence. Our experiments showed the same result solely\n\nfor concave-up backstops. Our experiment with con-\n\nvex-up backstops generated different final results, with\n\nbackward rise initially occurring on a backthrust, as in\n\nthe experiments with > 60?-ramp geometry reported by\n\nBonini et al. (1999). However, with the progressive de-\n\nformation in our experiments, the more the backstop was\n\npushed forward, the more the backthrust got closer until\n\nthe backstop touched it. In the following steps of the\n\nexperiment, the sand pack rose in such a way that the\n\nascension seemed to occur along the backstop itself.\n\nField evidences of backward movement in inver-\n\nsion tectonics environments are not common. In the\n\nnorthern precambrian Espinha\u00e7o Basin, on the eastern\n\nmargin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, Abad Posada (un-\n\npublished data) described an inversion process with reac-\n\ntivation of normal detachments, buttressing effect (coun-\n\nterclockwise rotation of the syn-rift pack) and backward\n\nshearing along the eastern basement block (Fig. 14).\n\nWe noticed that, despite the absence of forethrusts, the\n\nbulk deformation pattern in the cross-section of Figure\n\n14, which was constrained on line-length balancing and\n\nrestoration to the horizontal, is in good agreement with\n\nour experimental models with the concave-up backstops\n\n(compare, for example, Figs. 14 and 10iv).\n\nThe fault reactivation\n\nAccording to Brun and Nalpas (1996), sand models with\n\ndeformable footwall and hanging wall blocks require a\n\nstrike-slip component to the reactivation of preexisting\n\nnormal faults. Panien et al. (2005) demonstrated that in-\n\nversion achieved with deformable footwall and hanging\n\nwall blocks produces forethrusts and backthrusts that cut\n\nacross extensional faults, whereas reactivation is a minor\n\nprocess. Eisenstadt and Sims (2005) compared inversion\n\nproduced by dry sand and wet clay and concluded that,\n\nindependently of boundary conditions, the inversion in\n\nanalogue models is rheologically sensitive. Whilst in dry\n\nsand models it causes essentially uplift by sets of conju-\n\ngate thrusts and minor reactivation of pre-existent faults,\n\nin wet clay models normal fault reactivation prevails re-\n\ngardless of fault dip, probably due to high fluid pressure.\n\nThe results of our models are consistent with ana-\n\nlogue experiments of the \u2018fault reactivation model\u2019,\n\nwhich show strong influence of rigid basement blocks\n\n(e.g., McClay and Buchanan 1992, Buchanan and Mc-\n\nClay 1991). Our experimental set-up differs from that\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2010) 82 (4)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2010/11/5 \u2014 18:21 \u2014 page 1009 \u2014 #13\n\nTHE BACKSTOP SHAPE DURING BASIN INVERSION 1009\n\nFig. 14 \u2013 (i) Balanced cross-section of the northern Serra do Espinha\u00e7o Range, eastern margin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton, Brazil (see inset for\n\nlocalization), illustrating an inversion process with a concave-up backstop (modified from Abad Posada, unpublished data).

DA SILVA\n\na concave-up backstop may generate reactivation from\n\n40% of shortening on, a convex-up backstop does not\n\nproduce any normal detachment reactivation until 60%\n\nof shortening.\n\nThe buttress\n\nOur experimental models, performed with stiff normal\n\nfootwalls, produced counterclockwise rotation of the\n\nsyn-rift sequence in the contractional foreland due to the\n\npresence of a 70?-dip normal detachment cut-off angle.\n\nWe presume that a 60?-dip normal footwall with a high\n\nfrictional basal detachment may produce the same result.\n\nAs with the backward movement, the buttress-ef-\n\nfect is rarely described in inversion tectonics. Rotation\n\nof the syn-rift pack was related to a buttress effect by de\n\nGraciansky et al. (1989) along the Gourdan-Vial reverse\n\nfault, in the Western Maritime Alps. Bailey et al. (2002)\n\nstudied the Tye River fault zone in the Appalachian Blue\n\nRidge Province and concluded that, during inversion, a\n\nbasement-cored extensional footwall acted as a buttress\n\nand controlled folding in the cover sequence.\n\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nBackward movement in contractional environments is\n\ncommonly described as a buttress effect (the thrust-sheet\n\ndislocation restrains due to a rigid mass in the foreland),\n\nbut as demonstrated by Bonini et al. (1999), it may de-\n\npend on the backstop geometry. Eisenstadt and Sims\n\n(2005) call attention to the fact that, in sand models,\n\nboth in contraction and in inversion, regardless to the\n\nboundary conditions, the shortening is accommodated\n\nby sand pack rising bounded by a fore- and a backthrust.\n\nThus, our experimental models demonstrated that the\n\nbackstop geometry does not modify overall deformation\n\nstructures, but controls the predominant extrusion sense\n\nand, as a consequence, the normal detachment reactiva-\n\ntion.\n\nThe backstop height controls backward movement\n\nversus vertical strain, but does not interfere in the forward\n\nmovement or reactivation of pre-existent normal detach-\n\nment. Finally, the comparison with Buchanan and Mc-\n\nClay\u2019s (1991) experiments suggests that the reactivation\n\nof pre-existent normal detachment is more dependent on\n\nsand pack height than on backstop height.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn our analogue sand models that simulated the inver-\nsion of a half-graben using stiff undeformable footwall\nblocks and stiff backstops of different geometry, the fol-\nlowing features were detected:\n\na) a convex-up backstop produces the ejection of the\nsedimentary sequence to the hinterland, and un-\ntil 60% of shortening no reactivation of the exten-\nsional detachment takes place;\n\nb) a concave-up backstop also generates a strong ejec-\ntion to the hinterland, but forward propagating\nmovement leading to detachment reactivation may\ntake place after 40% of shortening;\n\nc) a vertical backstop, regardless to its height, pro-\nduces normal detachment reactivation after 20% of\nshortening;\n\nd) a high (70?) normal detachment cut-off angle\ncauses pronounced rotation of the syn-rift sequence\nin the inversional foreland.\n\nThe results suggest that the reactivation of a nor-\nmal detachment in inversion tectonics is strongly influ-\nenced by the backstop geometry. In the reactivation\nprocess, the backstop height is a negligible factor. We\nconclude that different backstop geometries may mod-\nify the common shortening process that is usually ac-\ncommodated by a pop-up type structure with equal slip\non fore- and backthrust. In addition, we conclude that a\nstiff high angle footwall leads to a buttress effect in the\nsyn-rift sequence.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe wish to thank the financial support from Conselho\nNacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico and Tecnol\u00f3-\ngico (CNPq) (process no. 477157/2003-3) and from\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas\nGerais (FAPEMIG) (CRA 871/06).
