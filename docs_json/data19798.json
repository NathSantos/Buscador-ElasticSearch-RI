However, few studies aiming to\nunderstand the effect of topography on the variability of CO\n\n2\n emissions exist, especially for cropping\n\nareas of tropical regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes\nof soil CO\n\n2\n emission and its relation to soil attributes in an area currently cropped with sugarcane\n\nunder different relief forms and slope positions. Mean CO2 emissions in the studied period (seven\nmonths) varied between 0.23 and 0.71, 0.27 and 0.90, and 0.31 and 0.80 g m\u20132 h\u20131 of CO\n\n2 \nfor concave\n\n(Conc), backslope (BackS) and footslope (FootS) positions, respectively. The temporal variability of\nCO\n\n2 \nemissions in each area was explained by an exponential relation between the CO\n\n2 \nemission and soil\n\ntemperature and a linear relation between CO2 emission and soil water content. The Q10 values were\n1.98 (\u00b1 0.34), 1.81 (\u00b1 0.49) and 1.71 (\u00b1 0.31) for Conc, BackS and FootS, respectively. Bulk density,\nmacroporosity, penetration resistance, aggregation and oxidizable organic carbon content explain the\nchanges in soil CO\n\n2\n emission observed, especially when the Conc position was compared to BackS.\n\nThe effect of relief form and topographic position on soil CO2 emission variation was dependent on\nthe time of measurement.\nKey words: soil respiration, temporal variation, spatial variation, soil attributes, soil porosity\n\nEMISS\u00c3O DE CO2 DO SOLO SOB CULTIVO DE CANA-DE-A\u00c7\u00daCAR\nEM FUN\u00c7\u00c3O DA TOPOGRAFIA\n\nRESUMO: A varia\u00e7\u00e3o temporal e espacial da emiss\u00e3o de CO\n2\n solo-atmosfera \u00e9 influenciada por in\u00fameros\n\natributos do solo relacionados \u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o de CO\n2\n e \u00e0 difus\u00e3o do g\u00e1s no solo.

Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.66, n.1, p.77-83, January/February 2009\n\nsources of CO2 production, and the transport of the\ngas is governed by diffusion. These processes, in turn,\nare influenced by several attributes that establish the\nspatial and temporal variations of soil CO2 emission.\nSoil temperature and soil water content, or the inter-\naction between both, are the main controlling factors\nof the variability of soil respiration (Kang et al., 2003;\nKang et al., 2000). Besides temperature and water, the\nspatial variability of soil respiration is also controlled\nby organic carbon, microbial biomass, root biomass,\nlitter, nutrients (N, Mg, Ca, P), pH, cation exchange\ncapacity, iron oxide content, bulk density and poros-\nity (Epron et al., 2006; Xu &amp; Qi, 2001; La Scala J\u00fanior\net al., 2000; Fang et al., 1998).\n\nChanges in CO2 emissions and soil chemical,\nphysical and biological properties have been reported\nto be related to land exposition and slope length (Kang\net al., 2006; Kang et al., 2003), microtopography (Jia\net al., 2003), slope position (Risch &amp; Frank, 2006;\nHanson et al., 1993), slope angle (Silva et al., 2004)\nand relief form (Souza et al., 2006; Souza et al.,\n2004a,b,c; Souza et al., 2003). Such topographic as-\npects affect ground and underground water flows,\nconstituting the major cause of spatial variability of soil\nattributes (Daniels &amp; Hammer, 1992).\n\nNowadays, in the worldwide scenario, Brazil\nis the main sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) producer, with\n6.96 million cropped hectares. This area represents al-\nmost 11.5% of the total cropped area with the main\nBrazilian agricultural products. S\u00e3o Paulo is the major\nsugarcane producer state, with 3.68 million hectares,\ncorresponding to 52.9% of the total area cropped with\nsugarcane in Brazil. Considering that the total area\ncropped with sugarcane increases every year, reach-\ning a 13% increase in 2007/2008 in relation to 2006/\n2007 (Conab, 2008), studying the spatial and tempo-\nral changes of soil CO2 emission in such agrosystem\nis of great interest.\n\nThe objective of this work was to identify the\ntopographic effect on spatial and temporal variations\nof soil CO2 emission in an area currently cropped with\nsugarcane in the Southeastern region of Brazil, and to\ndetermine the soil attributes that control such varia-\ntions.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe experiment was carried out on the Santa\nIsabel Farm located at 21\u00ba17\u2019 to 21\u00ba18\u2019 S and 48\u00ba08\u2019\nto 48\u00ba10\u2019 W, in Jaboticabal, S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil,\nwhere sugarcane has been cropped for over 60 years\nand mechanically harvested (green) for over the last\nten years. The climate of the region is characterized\nby tropical rainy summers and dry winters, being clas-\n\nsified as Aw by K\u00f6epen. The average temperature is\n24.3\u00baC and 18.8\u00baC for January and July, respectively,\nwhile the average year precipitation is around 1425\nmm, with total monthly precipitations of 239.5 mm and\n25.3 mm for January and July, respectively. The soil\nis classified as Typic Eutrustox.\n\nThe topography of the area presents two re-\nlief forms, one concave occurring in the highest posi-\ntion of the landscape, and the other linear, towards the\nhillside, as described in Souza et al. (2003). The sam-\nplings were performed in a 100 \u00d7 100 m limited area\nin the concave form (Conc) and in two positions in\nthe linear form, backslope (BackS) and footslope\n(FootS) (Figure 1).\n\nSoil CO2 emission measurements were con-\nducted during 17 days, from April 28 (one month af-\nter sugarcane plantation) to November 23, 2004, with\nten randomized replicates for each area in each sam-\npling day. The evaluations were conducted in the\nmorning (9\u201311 h) or in the afternoon (14\u201316 h), and\nin some days with measurements conducted in morn-\nings and afternoons, using a flux chamber (LI-6400-\n09 CO2, LI-COR, NE, USA) according to Healy et al.\n(1996). The chamber is a closed system with an in-\nternal volume of 991 cm3 and soil exposed area of 71.6\ncm2, and coupled to a LI-6400 photosynthesis system\nthat analyzes the CO2 concentration by infrared gas\nabsorption. The chamber was placed on the top of\nPVC soil collars installed in the field, between rows,\nsome days before the measurements, eliminating the\nCO2 flush out effect due to the ring insertion in soil.\n\nSoil temperature (T) was evaluated by a sen-\nsor connected to the chamber on each one of the ten\nevaluation points of CO2 emission at a depth of 0\u20130.15\n\nFigure 1 - Altimetric profile covering the concave and linear\npedoforms, where the concave backslope and\nfootslope positions were identified.

Gravimetric soil water con-\ntent (GM) was determined on 11 of the 17 days of\nstudy, in the same replicates and depths (Gardner,\n1986).\n\nSoil analysis was made on disturbed and un-\ndisturbed soil samples, with five replicates in each area.\nSoil bulk density was determined on undisturbed soil\ncores (0.04 m long and 0.05 m diameter) (Embrapa,\n1997). Total porosity (TP) was calculated based on\nsoil bulk density. Pore size distribution (macroporosity\n- Macro; microporosity - Micro) was determined based\non soil water retention using a tension table (Embrapa,\n1997).\n\nAggregate stability (Kemper &amp; Rosenau, 1986)\nwas determined by sieving in water, with aggregates\nthat passed through a 7.93-mm sieve and were retained\nin a 4.76-mm sieve, and then separated in classes us-\ning a set of sieves of meshes of 4.76 mm, 2 mm, 1\nmm, 0.5 mm and 0.25 mm. Results were expressed\nin terms of geometric mean diameter (GMD), percent-\nage of aggregates larger than 2 mm (? > 2 mm), per-\ncentage of aggregates  between 2\u20131 mm (? 2-1 mm)\nand percentage of aggregates smaller than 1 mm (?\n<1 mm).\n\nThe soil sampled with an auger was passed\nthrough a 2-mm sieve to determine particle-size dis-\ntribution (pipette and sieving method, after the soil\nsamples had been dispersed chemically in a 0.1 M\nNaOH solution and mechanically in low-rotation agi-\ntation for 16 hours, modified by Embrapa (1997)),\nFe2O 3 content (extracted with sulphuric acid)\n(Embrapa, 1979) and oxidizable organic carbon con-\ntent (CO) (Raij et al., 1987).\n\nPenetration resistance (PR) was measured us-\ning an impact penetrometer (IAA/PLANALSUCAR -\nSTOLF), according to Stolf (1991), with ten replicates\nin each area, down to the depth of 0.15 m. When per-\nforming the penetration resistance tests, soil samples\nwere taken for GM determination, down to the same\ndepth.\n\nAll soil attributes were evaluated by the analy-\nsis of variance using the following models for each\nset of response variables: (1st) soil CO2 emission, soil\ntemperature and soil water content: Yij = m + Pi +\nError(a) + Tj + PiTj + Error(b), Yij being the value of\neach observation, m the general mean, Pi the effect\nof the topographic position i, Error(a) the plot error,\nTj the effect of time j, PiTj the effect of the interac-\ntion between topographic position and time, Error(b)\nthe general error; and (2nd) for other evaluated at-\ntributes: Yij = m + Pi + Error(geral), Yij being the value\nof each observation, m  the general mean, Pi the ef-\nfect of the topographic position i, Error(geral) the gen-\neral error. Tukey\u2019s test was applied for the multiple\n\ncomparisons of the means with 10% of probability. All\nstatistical results were obtained by the SAS/Statistical\nAnalysis Systems software package (SAS Institute,\n1998).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nSoil CO2 emission variability\nSoil CO2 emission throughout the 7-month pe-\n\nriod in different landscape positions (Figure 2), had\nmean values for Conc, BackS and FootS of 0.38, 0.47\nand 0.45 g CO2 m\n\n\u20132 h\u20131 (Table 1), respectively, and their\nvariation during this period was above 200%. The\nBackS area presented mean emissions values between\n0.27 and 0.90 g CO2 m\n\n\u20132 h\u20131. This variation is a con-\nsequence of the local climate. The lowest emissions\nare observed in the winter (June 20 to September 21,\n2004, Figure 2), which is characterized by lower pre-\ncipitation and temperatures. Campos (2003) reports\nsmaller values for annual means of soil CO2 emission\nin sugarcane areas in both the traditional slash and burn-\ning manual harvesting system (0.13 g CO2 m\n\n\u20132 h\u20131) and\nthe mechanized harvesting without trash burning (0.14\ng CO2 m\n\n\u20132 h\u20131). Despite these lower values, the author\nalso found a variation of 200% in CO2 emission (0.07\nto 0.21 g CO2 m\n\n\u20132 h\u20131) throughout the 11-month cul-\nture cycle.\n\nThe great temporal variability in CO2 emission\npresented in our study shows the importance of\nevaluating emissions in different land conditions and\ntime scales. Since CO2 emission is affected by a large\nnumber of factors, when extrapolating emissions for\nlarger areas it is important to take into account its\nspatial and temporal controls, like soil temperature,\nmoisture, texture, litter stocks and topographical po-\nsition (Sotta et al., 2006). Indirect estimates based\non the difference in soil organic carbon stocks are\n\nFigure 2 - Soil-atmosphere CO\n2 \nemission in the concave (Conc),\n\nbackslope (BackS) and footslope (FootS) positions.\nEvaluations performed from April 28 to November\n23, 2004.

Hanson et al. (1993) also found differences in\nCO2 emission in some evaluations, but not for the\nwhole period of study, when comparing emissions\nfrom areas in different topographic positions (top, slope\nor valley). The topography effect on soil CO2 emis-\nsion was observed especially in the first days of the\nexperiment, when the soil was found almost bare with\nno vegetation. The fact that the differences in the emis-\nsions between the positions were not maintained dur-\ning the whole experiment is probably related to other\nfactors, such as the contribution of root respiration with\nthe development of the root system of the sugarcane,\nin agreement with Parkin et al. (2005). According to\nthese authors, root respiration masked the effect of\ntopography on soil CO2 emission, since such effect is\ngreater on maize crops, a grassy crop like sugarcane,\nthan on soybean crops.\n\nDuring the first days of the experiment, the\nBackS area presented the highest emissions in relation\nto those observed in the Conc and FootS areas (p&lt;\n0.10) (Figure 2), indicating that soil CO2 emission is\ndifferent in relation to topographic positions. Other au-\nthors report a significant increase in soil CO2 emission\nin the descending direction of the hillside, with higher\nemissions in the lower positions of the hillslope when\ncompared to top positions. This is related to the con-\ntribution of erosion, since, in the lowered parts, an in-\ncrease in soil surface biomass (Risch &amp; Frank, 2006),\nthickness and organic matter content of the A horizons\nand crop productivity (DeJong, 1981) is observed.\nHowever, the increase in CO2 emission in our study\ndid not occur in this direction along the hillside. The\nsoil cover from crop residues has probably provided\ngreater protection against erosion processes, prevent-\ning soil loss and reduction in surface organic carbon,\nsince the area in the higher positions presented higher\nsoil CO2 emission and organic carbon content (Table\n1). On the other hand, when comparing Conc with lin-\near relief forms (BackS and FootS), it was observed\nthat the relief form did not always determine differ-\nences in CO2 emission at the beginning of the experi-\nment, since on some days no difference was observed\nbetween Conc and FootS emissions.\n\netubirttA 1 evacnoC epolskcaB epolstooF )%(VC 2\n\nOC\n2\n\nOCg(m\n2\n\nm 2\u2013 h 1\u2013 ) )12.0(83.0 )62.0(74.0 )42.0(54.0 12.55\n\n)C\u00ba(T )58.3(74.22 )16.3(10.32 )28.3(26.32 34.61\n\n)%(M )81.6(53.12 )69.5(12.12 )28.5(51.02 86.82\n\ngkg(yalC 1\u2013 ) a00.016 a76.675 a33.606 97.4\n\ngkg(tliS 1\u2013 ) a00.552 a76.652 a76.332 37.01\n\ngkg(dnaS 1\u2013 ) b00.531 a76.661 a00.061 62.3\n\nmdgk(DB 3\u2013 ) a34.1 b22.1 a73.1 19.2\n\nm(PT 3 m 3\u2013 ) a774.0 a194.0 a544.0 80.11\n\nm(orciM 3 m 3\u2013 ) a434.0 a993.0 a343.0 67.51\n\nm(orcaM 3 m 3\u2013 ) b340.0 a290.0 a201.0 14.81\n\n)aPM(RP a52.2 b05.1 ba26.1 42.82\n\n)mm(DMG b33.1 a50.2 ba57.1 29.32\n\n? )%(mm2> b69.05 a77.47 ba71.66 94.22\n\n? )%(mm1-2 a49.9 b44.3 ba71.6 12.26\n\n? )%(mm1&lt;a01.93 b08.12 ba66.72 11.73\n\nmdg(OC 3\u2013 ) b74.61 a84.02 ba51.81 01.21\n\neF\n2\nO\n\n3\n)%( 53.51 52.91 00.12 -\n\nTable 1 - CO2 emission and soil attributes evaluated in the concave, backslope and footslope positions at a depth of 0\u20130.15m\non a sugarcane culture area.\n\n1CO\n2\nm, T and M (mean soil CO\n\n2\n emission, temperature and moisture over the studied period and their respective standard errors in\n\nbrackets; BD (bulk density), TP (total porosity), Micro (microporosity), Macro (macroporosity), PR (penetration resistance), GMD\n(geometric mean diameter), ?>2 mm (% of aggregates with diameter larger than 2 mm), ?2-1 mm (% of aggregates with diameter\nbetween 2 and 1 mm); ?<1 mm (% of aggregates with diameter smaller than 1 mm), CO (oxidizable organic carbon), Fe\n\n2\nO\n\n3\n (obtained\n\nfrom sulphuric attack). 2CV: coefficient of variation.

Considering the same soil\nattributes, the values for FootS were between those\nfound for the Conc and BackS areas, differing from\nBackS in relation to bulk density and from Conc in re-\nlation to macroporosity only. These results reinforce\nthe influence of topographic position and/or relief form\non soil attributes.\n\nThe area presenting the smallest bulk density\nand penetration resistance and the highest\nmacroporosity was the one that presented the highest\nCO2 emission (BackS) (Table 1 and Figure 2). This\nresult shows the importance of the soil porous space\nfor gaseous transport and, consequently, for micro-\nbial activity, which is in aggreament with the results\nfound by Xu &amp; Qi (2001). Higher total porosity fa-\ncilitates oxygen entrance into the soil, favoring respi-\nration and, consequently, increasing CO2 emissions\n(Fang et al., 1998). Although total porosity values\nfor Conc, BackS and FootS were similar, the highest\nemissions were observed on the sites with\nhigher macroporosity. This indicates the influence\nof pore size distribution on emissions, since soil\ngas diffusion, according to Fick\u2019s law:\n\n (where ECO2 is\nthe soil CO2 emission, arCOD 2?  the diffusion coefficient\nof the gas in the air, (TP \u2013 M) the water free porosity,\nand (L / Le)2 the tortuosity factor) (Alven\u00e4s &amp; Jansson,\n1997), is not only dependent on total porosity (TP),\nbut also on tortuosity. Thus, macro and micropore dis-\ntribution determines the possible trajectories of gases\nin the soil, affecting both the entrance of O2 and the\nrelease of CO2.\n\nDifferences observed in Fe2O3 and oxidizable\norganic carbon content between topographic positions\nare coherent with the results obtained for aggregate\nstability indexes (GMD,&lt;?2 mm, ?2-1 mm and&lt;1\nmm, Table 1), confirming the positive relation between\nthese attributes and aggregation (Oades, 1984;\nSchwertmann &amp; Taylor, 1989). Despite the physical\nprotection by the organic matter associated with ag-\ngregation, the highest CO2 emissions were observed\nin BackS, which was probably due to the higher oxi-\ndizable organic carbon content of this area. A positive\nassociation between CO2 emissions and soil organic\ncarbon was also found by Xu &amp; Qi (2001) and La\n\nScala J\u00fanior et al. (2000). Yoo et al. (2006) reported\nhigher emissions in relation to higher soil organic car-\nbon content available for microbial activity.\n\nCO2 temporal emission and its relationship with\nsoil temperature and moisture\n\nSoil temperature throughout the period varied\nbetween 17.8 and 30.6\u00baC, the lowest value being ob-\nserved in Conc and the highest in FootS. Mean values\nfor each day varied between 17.9 to 30.2\u00baC, 18.8 to\n29.1\u00baC and 18.9 to 30.6\u00baC for Conc, BackS and FootS,\nrespectively. Comparing the areas, the major differ-\nences of daily mean temperature were observed be-\ntween Conc and FootS, being higher in FootS in 9 of\nthe 17 sampled days (Tukey, p &lt;0.1). The tempera-\ntures for BackS did not differ from the other areas in\nmost of the observations. Considering the data from\nthe 17 evaluations, the coefficient of variation (CV) for\ntemperature was 16.43%. Analyzing the data from\neach day, this variation is lower, with CV values be-\ntween 1.39 and 8.25%, except for one observation\nwhere CV was 13.15%.\n\nThe temporal variability of soil CO2 emission\nin the different positions was explained by an expo-\nnential relation of emission to soil temperature (Fang\n&amp; Moncrieff, 2001; Xu &amp; Qi, 2001; Lloyd &amp; Taylor,\n1994). Model ECO2 = ae\u2013bTSOIL  (Equation 1) was fit-\nted to a linear relationship, thus obtaining a model of\nthe type  Ln (ECO2) = a + b TSOIL (Equation 2), which\npresented the best adjustment based on the coefficient\nof determination of the model (R2) for Conc in rela-\ntion to other linearly located areas (Table 2). Tempera-\nture accounted for 24 to 51% of the CO2 emission\nchanges, which is related to the smaller variation in\nsoil temperature (CV of 1.39 to 13.15%) in relation to\nthe variation of CO2 emission (CV of 19.3 to 61.3%).\n\nThe estimation of Q10, which represents the\nsensitivity of CO2 emission to a 10-degree-celsius in-\ncrease in soil temperature was calculated by the equa-\ntion Q10 = e10b (Equation 3) for each topographic posi-\ntion, where b stems from Equation 2 previously pre-\nsented. The results obtained for Conc, BackS and\nFootS were 1.98 (\u00b1 0.34), 1.81 (\u00b1 0.49) and 1.71 (\u00b1\n0.31), respectively, being close to values previously\nreported in the literature (Lloyd &amp; Taylor, 1994; Raich\n&amp; Schlesinger, 1992). By comparing topographic po-\nsitions Conc and BackS, it was observed that Conc\npresented a lower Q10 value and better aggregate sta-\nbility (Table 1). This result, according to Davidson &amp;\nJanssens (2006), may stem from greater physical pro-\ntection from soil organic matter and, consequently,\nfrom a reduction in emission sensitivity in relation to\nsoil temperature in these areas. Nevertheless, when\nconsidering the three topographic positions, it was not\n\ndxdCLeLMTPDE arCOCO /)/)((\n2\n\n22\n??=\n\n\n\nBrito et al.82\n\nSci. Agric. (Piracicaba, Braz.), v.66, n.1, p.77-83, January/February 2009\n\npossible to draw any conclusions concerning this re-\nlationship between aggregation and Q10, since FootS\npresented the lowest Q10 value, and did not differ from\nthe other areas in relation to aggregation.\n\nConsidering the studied period the mean soil\nwater content varied from 13.2 to 29.7%, 14.6 to\n30.5% and 12.6 to 28.5% for Conc, BackS and FootS,\nrespectively. Soil water contents were affected by the\nposition in the slope, since the major differences were\nobserved between BackS and FootS (Tukey, p &lt;0.1).\nThe CV value for the total period was 28.68%, and\nanalyzing the variation during each day, the CV varied\nfrom 5.72 to 24.37%.\n\nThe temporal variability of CO2 emission could\nbe explained by a linear relation with soil water con-\ntent (E(CO2) = a + b MSOIL) (Equation 4) in Conc and\nBackS only (p &lt;0.1) (Table 2). Soil water content ac-\ncounted for 31 and 43% of the emission variation for\nthose areas, respectively. The lack of relationship be-\ntween soil water content and emissions in FootS sug-\ngests that the effect of the soil water content is de-\npendent on the topographic position.\n\nIn summary, soil temperature affected the\ntemporal changes in soil CO2 emission in all areas while\nthe effect of soil water content was evident only in\nConc and BackS. Other researchers report the effect\nof these factors on emission changes. Soil respiration\nwas dominantly controlled by temperature in a moun-\ntain area in China, since the influence of moisture was\nobserved only when it was a limiting factor (Li et al.,\n2007). Reth et al. (2005) also related a relation between\nsoil moisture and CO2 emission only in the dry period\nof the year. Results obtained in the eastern Amazonian\narea (Brazil) (Sotta et al., 2006) and in a tropical\n\nrainforest (Asia) (Kosugi et al., 2007) show that the\ntemporal variability of soil CO2 efflux was depended\nmainly on soil water content. Strong effects of soil\ntemperature and soil water content on CO2 were ob-\nserved in managed forests in Canada (Peng &amp; Tho-\nmas, 2006).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nTo FCAV-UNESP Graduated Program in Plant\nProduction; to CAPES, CNPq and FAPESP for finan-\ncial support; and to Santa Isabel Farm for providing\nthe study area and technical support.\n\nREFERENCES\nALVEN\u00c4S, G.; JANSSON, P.E.
