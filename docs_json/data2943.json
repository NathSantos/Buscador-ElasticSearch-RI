Modelagem nume?rica conjunta de processos sedimentares e\n\ntecto?nicos em bacias sedimentares 2011. 184pp. Tese (Doutorado) - Instituto de\n\nAstronomia, Geof??sica e Cie?ncias Atmosfe?ricas, Universidade de Sa?o Paulo, Sa?o Paulo,\n\n2011.\n\nO principal objetivo deste trabalho e? prever a evoluc?a?o de margens divergentes desde\n\no in??cio da extensa?o litosfe?rica, levando-se em considerac?a?o a interac?a?o entre processos\n\nsuperficiais e tecto?nicos. Para isto, foi desenvolvido um modelo nume?rico que acopla isos-\n\ntasia flexural, efeitos te?rmicos, estiramento litosfe?rico e processos superficiais. A isostasia\n\nflexural e? simulada atrave?s de uma placa ela?stica fina sobre um fluido inv??scido, repre-\n\nsentando o comportamento flexural da litosfera flutuando sobre a astenosfera. Durante a\n\nsimulac?a?o, a estrutura te?rmica da litosfera evolui como um resultado da advecc?a?o e difusa?o\n\ndo calor no interior da Terra. Considera-se que o estiramento da litosfera e? acomodado\n\npor falhas planas na crosta superior e deformac?a?o du?ctil na crosta inferior e manto. O\n\nmodelo de processos superficiais descreve como a paisagem e? erodida e como os sedimentos\n\nsa?o transportados e depositados nas bacias sedimentares. Atrave?s desse modelo nume?rico,\n\ne? mostrado que o estiramento litosfe?rico tem uma profunda influe?ncia na evoluc?a?o da mi-\n\ngrac?a?o de escarpas em margens divergentes. Os resultados sugerem que escarpas limitadas\n\npor falhas criadas em flancos de rifts por descarregamento meca?nico e resposta flexural\n\nte?m pouca chance de \u201csobreviver\u201d atrave?s de recuo erosivo se a crosta inferior sob o flanco\n\ndo rift foi substancialmente estirada. Nessa configurac?a?o, o divisor de drenagem que per-\n\nsiste atrave?s do tempo e? criado em direc?a?o ao continente em uma posic?a?o que depende\n\nda rigidez flexural da crosta superior. Esse cena?rio ocorre quando a topografia pre?-rift\n\n\n\nmergulha para o continente, caso contra?rio a evoluc?a?o da escarpa e? guiada pelo divisor\n\nde a?guas interior pre?-existente. Esses conceitos sa?o aplicados no estudo das margens do\n\nsudeste da Australia e do sudeste do Brasil, onde o cena?rio de retrac?a?o de escarpas atrave?s\n\nde recuo erosivo mostrou-se improva?vel. O mesmo modelo nume?rico foi utilizado para\n\nestudar como a passagem de uma anomalia te?rmica sob a litosfera pode afetar a evoluc?a?o\n\npo?s-rift de bacias sedimentares em margens divergentes. Os resultados nume?ricos mostram\n\nque a velocidade da litosfera em relac?a?o a? anomalia te?rmica e a rigidez flexural da litosfera\n\nocea?nica e continental afetam a evoluc?a?o de bacias sedimentares devido ao soerguimento\n\nda superf??cie relacionado com a expansa?o te?rmica da litosfera. Como exemplo, e? estudada\n\na poss??vel influe?ncia de uma anomalia te?rmica (Pluma de Trindade?) na evoluc?a?o das\n\nbacias de Campos e Esp??rito Santo, na margem sudeste brasileira.\n\nPalavras chave: Processos superficiais, processos tecto?nicos, modelagem nume?rica,\n\nmargens divergentes.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nSACEK, V. Joint numerical modeling of sedimentary and tectonic processes\n\nin sedimentary basins 2011. 184pp. Thesis (Doctorate) - Instituto de Astronomia,\n\nGeof??sica e Cie?ncias Atmosfe?ricas, Universidade de Sa?o Paulo, Sa?o Paulo, 2011.\n\nThe purpose of this work is to predict the evolution of divergent margins since the\n\nonset of lithospheric extension, taking into account the interaction between surface and\n\ntectonic processes. For this, a numerical model was developed to study the coupling of\n\nflexural isostasy, thermal effects, stretching of the lithosphere and surface processes. The\n\nflexural isostasy is simulated through a thin elastic plate overlying an inviscid fluid, re-\n\npresenting the flexural behavior of the lithosphere floating on the asthenosphere. During\n\nthe simulation, the thermal structure of the lithosphere evolves as a result of advection\n\nand diffusion of heat in the Earth\u2019s interior. The stretching of the lithosphere is assumed\n\nto be accommodated by planar faults in the upper crust and ductile flow in the lower\n\ncrust and mantle. The surface processes model describes how the landscape is eroded and\n\nhow the sediments are transported and deposited in the sedimentary basins. The results\n\nfrom this numerical model show that the amount of lithospheric stretching has a profound\n\ninfluence on the evolution of escarpment migration in divergent margins. These results\n\nsuggest that fault-bounded escarpments created at rift flanks by mechanical unloading\n\nand flexural rebound have little potential to \u201csurvive\u201d as retreating escarpments if the\n\nlower crust under the rift flank is substantially stretched. In this configuration, a drainage\n\ndivide that persists through time is created landward in a position that depends on the\n\nflexural rigidity of the upper crust. This scenario occurs when the pre-rift topography\n\ndips landward, otherwise the evolution of the escarpment is guided by the pre-existing\n\n\n\ninland drainage divide. These concepts are applied to study the margins of Southeastern\n\nAustralia and Southeastern Brazil, where the retreating escarpment scenario showed to be\n\nunlikely. The same numerical model is used to study how the passage of a thermal anomaly\n\nunder the lithosphere can affect the post-rift evolution of sedimentary basins in divergent\n\nmargins. The numerical results show that the velocity of the lithosphere relative to the\n\nthermal anomaly and the flexural rigidity of the continental and oceanic lithospheres affect\n\nthe evolution of sedimentary basins due to surface uplift related to thermal expansion of\n\nthe lithosphere. As an example, the model is applied to assess the possible influence of a\n\nthermal anomaly (Trindade Plume?) on the evolution of the Campos and Esp??rito Santo\n\nBasins, in Southeastern Brazilian margin.\n\nKeywords: Surface processes, tectonic processes, numerical modeling, divergent mar-\n\ngins.\n\n\n\nList of Figures\n\n1.1 Surface and tectonic processes that influence the evolution of the Earth\u2019s\n\nsurface in the context of divergent margins.

While tectonic movements modify the topography as a result of the Earth\u2019s interior\n\ndynamics, the surface processes sculpt the landscape through erosion and deposition, re-\n\nsulting in horizontal remobilization of material. These surface processes are dependent on,\n\ne.g., the climatic conditions, local relief and lithological controls.\n\nOn the other hand, the evolution of the Earth\u2019s surface also affects the interior of the\n\nEarth. For example, the primary direct influence of surface processes on the lithosphere\n\nis the isostatic effect due to erosion of continents and deposition of sediments in the sedi-\n\nmentary basins. These processes related to (un)loading at the surface can result in many\n\nkilometers of vertical lithospheric displacement (Reiners and Brandon, 2006).\n\nTherefore, the surface and the interior of the Earth must be seen as a coupled system,\n\neach one modifying the evolution of the other (Figure 1.1). In this sense, the coupling of\n\nsurface and tectonic processes represents a complex system (Bar-Yam, 1997). A complex\n\nsystem can be defined as a system composed of interconnected components that interact\n\nwith each other and, eventually, the combination of these components can manifest pro-\n\n\n\n30 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nLong-term landscape evolution 335\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. Earth Surf. Process. Landforms 32, 329\u2013365 (2007)\nDOI: 10.1002/esp\n\nbasins. Conversely, the fact that the continents have a higher average elevation than the ocean basins reflects both the\nlower density of continental lithosphere and its greater thickness. One of the key issues in understanding the long-term\nlandscape evolution of high-elevation continental areas, and particularly the persistence of such areas, is generating\nthe lithospheric thickening that underpins or supports such high elevations. In effect, the issue is generating the\nhorizontal and vertical fluxes of rock required to produce high elevations and to sustain them, and the elegance of\nplate tectonics in supplying these mass fluxes of lithosphere is one of the fundamental reasons that plate tectonics\nre-vivified long-term landscape evolution studies. It is also important to note that the lithosphere has strength and will\nbend and flex when a load is applied, including when a negative load is applied as a result of denudation. This flexure\nof the lithosphere in response to a load is termed flexural isostasy, and the strength of the lithosphere (or its flexural\nrigidity) determines the lateral extent (or horizontal distance) over which the loading has an effect.\n\nDenudational isostatic rebound, the notion that the lithosphere floats up in response to denudational unloading, is\ngenerally a central part of all modern interpretations of long-term landscape evolution. For areas in isostatic equilib-\nrium, denudational isostasy means that, for every metre that is removed from the Earth\u2019s surface by denudation, the\nEarth\u2019s surface is uplifted by about 0\u00b78 m (0\u00b78 being the approximate ratio of the densities of the crust and sub-\nlithospheric mantle). The importance of such denudational isostasy in maintaining relief had been realized by the\n1830s, and the notion was applied sporadically throughout the 20th century to suggest that mountain peaks may be\nuplifted isostatically as a result of the unloading caused by the incision by major rivers flowing between the mountain\npeaks (e.g., Jeffreys, 1931; Wager, 1937; for more detail see Bishop, 2007). King (1955) and Pugh (1955) argued that\nthe crustal unloading associated with escarpment retreat on continental margins such as southern Africa would like-\nwise lead to isostatic uplift of the margin.\n\nFigure 1. The processes driving landscape evolution in (a) convergent settings and (c) extensional (rifting) settings. (b) and\n(d) highlight the various observations that can be used to test models of the structure and evolution of the two tectonic settings.\nNote that geomorphology is an important observational element in both settings (from Beaumont et al. (2000), Figure 3.2,\nreproduced by permission of John Wiley and Sons Ltd).\n\nFigure 1.1: Surface and tectonic processes that influence the evolution of the Earth\u2019s surface\n\nin the context of divergent margins. Extracted from Bishop (2007). Original figure from\n\nBeaumont et al. (2000).\n\nperties that are not observed when each component acts isolated.\n\nAn example of complex system is the interaction of erosion and isostatic response. The\n\nerosion of the continents, when observed isolated, results in the lowering of the topography\n\n(Figure 1.2a). On the other hand, when erosion is combined with the regional isostatic\n\nresponse of the lithosphere (Figure 1.2b), the evolving topography can leads to mountain\n\npeak uplift (Molnar and England, 1990). In both cases the mean elevation decreases\n\nthrough time, but the regional isostatic compensation causes uplift of portions of the\n\nsurface less eroded. This example shows how the interaction between surface and tectonic\n\nprocesses can lead to counterintuitive results: erosion can induce local uplift.\n\nIn the context of divergent margins, Gilchrist and Summerfield (1990) showed that\n\nthe combination of erosion and flexural isostatic compensation can explain the formation\n\nand permanence of escarpments parallel to the coast, as observed in many rifted margins\n\naround the world (Matmon et al., 2002). In this model, the escarpment is maintained by\n\nflexural response of the lithosphere to the denudational unloading of the margin, resulting\n\nin the formation of the coastal plain (Figure 1.3).\n\nFollowing the model of Gilchrist and Summerfield (1990), many numerical models were\n\n\n\nSection 1.1.

Results of numerical model showing the escarpment lip upwarp in SW Africa that is the flexural response of the plateau\nedge to the denudational unloading associated with the formation of the coastal plain by escarpment retreat or in-place excavation\nof the escarpment, seaward (to the left of ) the escarpment (see text). The solid line represents the topography. The escarpment lip\nflexes up in response to the unloading on the adjacent coastal plain. The different model outcomes, represented by the variously\ndotted and dashed lines, correspond to model \u2018runs\u2019 employing different lithospheric flexural rigidities (different values of the\neffective elastic thickness, Te). Higher values of Te correspond to more rigid lithosphere and flexural effects over a correspondingly\nlonger distance. Thus, the unloading associated with coastal plain formation has the longest-distance flexural effect on the plateau\nsurface for the maximum Te value (here 22.5 km). Low values of Te (i.e. very flexible lithosphere) mean that the flexural effect is\ntransmitted the shortest distance inland of the escarpment lip, and are also associated with a very pronounced updoming on the\ncoastal plain (redrawn with corrections from Figure 2a of Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990).\n\nFigure 6.

As noted above, the lips of such wall-like escarpments tend to be a drainage divide, either the\nmain continental divide or a subsidiary but still major divide, in both cases maintained by flexural effects associated\nwith denudational unloading associated with coastal plain formation (Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990; Gunnel and\n\nFigure 1.3: Comparison between the topography predicted by the flexural models and the\n\ntopographic profile of the Southwestern Africa. Different effective elastic thicknesses Te for\n\nthe flexural model are presented. The escarpment is created by the flexural response of\n\nlithosphere to the unloading of the coastal region (for x &lt;100 km). Extracted from Bishop\n\n(2007), based on a modified figure from the original work of Gilchrist and Summerfield (1990).\n\ndeveloped to study the interaction of erosion and flexural isostasy in divergent margins,\n\nincorporating sophisticated models that dynamically simulate the erosion of the landscape\n\n\n\n32 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\n(see Merrits and Ellis, 1994, and papers in this volume). These models also explored how\n\npreexistent topographic features, climatic conditions, lithological resistance and flexural\n\nrigidity of the lithosphere influence the evolution of the escarpment. All these models\n\nshowed that the evolution of high-elevation escarpments in rifted margins is intimately\n\nrelated to the coupling of surface and tectonic processes.\n\nLikewise the escarpments along divergent margins, the sedimentary basins in rifted\n\nmargins are the product of the combined action of different processes. A classical example\n\nis the elegant model proposed by McKenzie (1978), where the subsidence history of the\n\nbasin in the rifted margin can be described as the coupling between a pure-shear stretching\n\nmodel, the thermal cooling of the lithosphere and the isostatic compensation. In this model,\n\nthe total subsidence of the sedimentary basin can be decomposed into three parts: (1) due\n\nto the initial stretching and thinning of the lithosphere; (2) due to the following cooling of\n\nthe lithosphere; and (3) due to the load of the influx of sediments to the basin.\n\nOther advances about the understanding of the evolution of sedimentary basins appea-\n\nred in the study of two dimensional problems. For example, Watts et al. (1982) developed\n\nbasin filling models where the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere increases through time as\n\na result of the cooling of the lithosphere. They observed that the increase of the flexural\n\nrigidity in the margin during the sedimentary filling results in the widening of the basin,\n\nproducing stratigraphic onlap (Figure 1.4a). Using a viscoelastic plate to represent the\n\nflexural behavior of the lithosphere to loading, Beaumont (1978) simulated the evolution\n\nof sedimentary basins on a lithosphere with decreasing rigidity, resulting in stratigraphic\n\nofflap (Figure 1.4b). An important result from these numerical models is that the effect\n\nof variations of flexural rigidity may be misinterpreted as due to variations in the sea level\n\nin the stratigraphic record.\n\nAll the models presented in this introduction are a few examples of how the coupling\n\nof different surface and tectonic processes can lead to fruitful insights into the evolution of\n\ndivergent margins. More examples can be seen in recent reviews that show the state-of-\n\nthe-art of the coupling of surface and tectonic processes in different tectonic settings (e.g.\n\nBeaumont et al., 2000; Braun, 2006; Bishop, 2007). Due to the complexity of the coupling\n\nof the many processes acting in the evolution of Earth\u2019s surface, the use of computer models\n\nis a natural procedure to quantify the relative importance of each of them.\n\n\n\nSection 1.2.

The decrease of the rigidity\n\nresults in gradual narrowing of the basin, causing stratigraphic offlap.\n\n1.2 The purpose of this work\n\nIn spite of the great number of numerical models created in the last decades to study\n\nthe coupling between surface and tectonic processes, there is a lack of models that take\n\ninto account the onshore and offshore parts of rifted margins, with a few exceptions (e.g.\n\nvan Balen et al., 1995). Furthermore, previous models developed to study the evolution of\n\npassive margins and the coupling of surface processes and flexural response do not include\n\nthe rifting during the simulation and treat the rifting conditions as a \u201cblack box\u201d.\n\nAiming to further contribute on the study of divergent margins, this work presents a\n\nnumerical model that tries to simulate the evolution of divergent margins since the onset of\n\nrifting, incorporating onshore and offshore processes of erosion and sedimentation, flexural\n\ncompensation and thermal processes in the lithosphere.\n\nThe aim of this thesis is not to develop new algorithms to investigate a specific geological\n\nprocess. Instead, the purpose of this work is to study how the combination of preexistent\n\nmodels for different geological processes contributes to the emergence of new scenarios,\n\nthat otherwise could not be predicted through the analysis of isolated processes.\n\nThe numerical model proposed here is a means to improve the understanding on the in-\n\nteraction between different processes acting during and after lithospheric stretching. The-\n\nrefore, the main target was to apply the model to geological problems, instead of the\n\n\n\n34 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\ndevelopment of the code itself. On the other hand, most of the project time was devoted\n\nto the development of each part of the code and the coupling of them. Thus the first\n\nchapters of this thesis are dedicated to describe in detail the numerical approach for each\n\nphysical/geological process incorporated in this study (Chapters 2 to 5), culminating in\n\nthe description of the coupling of all the processes (Chapter 6).\n\nChapter 2 presents the flexural model used to simulate the regional isostatic behavior\n\nof the lithosphere to vertical loading and Chapter 3 describes the model for the thermal\n\nevolution of the lithosphere. In both chapters, the finite element formulation is presented\n\nin detail, as well as the comparisons with analytical solutions. The kinematic model for\n\nthe stretching of the lithosphere to simulate rifting during the formation and evolution of\n\ndivergent margins is presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes the surface processes\n\nmodel that simulates the erosion, transport and deposition of sediments on the surface.\n\nChapter 7 shows the applications of the numerical model described in the previous\n\nchapters. In Section 7.1 an example of application is discussed on how rifting influences\n\nthe evolution of the landscape and the position of the drainage divide along rifted margins.\n\nThe predicted results are compared with the Southeastern margins of Brazil and Australia.\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the passage of thermal anomalies under the lithosphere influences\n\nthe evolution of sedimentary basins in divergent margins. A possible thermal influence\n\nof the Trindade Plume on the evolution of the Campos and Esp??rito Santo Basins in\n\nSoutheastern Brazil is analysed and discussed.\n\nFinally, Chapter 8 gives the conclusions of the thesis, the advantages and limitations\n\nof the numerical models as well as perspectives for future work.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nFlexure and isostasy1\n\nIt appears as though the mountain ranges\n\nhad been piled too high by tangential forces,\n\nand by virtue of the partial rigidity of the crust,\n\nhad depressed the heighboring ocean bottoms.\n\n(Barrell 1914 in Watts 2001)\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nThe concept of a strong uppermost layer of the Earth, named lithosphere, floating on\n\na weak layer, the asthenosphere, originated in the beginning of the 20th century, with\n\nthe work of Barrell (1914). This concept has survived through time and is an important\n\nelement to the theory of plate tectonics: \u201cPlate tectonics is based on the assumption that\n\nthe lithosphere is rigid on long timescales and is moving across the surface of the Earth\n\nwith the plates\u201d (Watts, 2007).\n\nA strong lithosphere floating on a weak substratum implies that geological loads are\n\nnot locally compensated by the buoyancy forces exerted by the asthenosphere (i.e. pure\n\nisostasy), but the load is partly sustained by the rigidity of the lithosphere. This behavior\n\nof the lithosphere can be approximated as a thin elastic plate floating on an inviscid\n\nsubstratum.\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century, the thin elastic plate representation of the\n\nlithosphere has been successfully used to explain the flexural behavior of the lithosphere,\n\n1The numerical model described in this chapter was presented in the article of Sacek and Ussami\n\n(2009).\n\n\n\n36 Chapter 2. Flexure and isostasy\n\nboth in oceans (e.g. Walcott, 1970; Watts, 1982) and continents (e.g. Karner and Watts,\n\n1983; Lyon-Caen and Molnar, 1983).\n\nThe thickness of the elastic plate that represents the flexural behavior of the real\n\nlithosphere is named effective elastic thickness or Te. The Te does not coincide with the\n\nlithospheric thickness and does not represent a real layer of the Earth. Instead, the effective\n\nelastic thickness is a measure of the integrated strength of the lithosphere. As part of the\n\nlithosphere behaves non-elastically through the geological time, the Te is thinner than the\n\nlithospheric thickness. The value of Te can vary in space and time and there are many\n\nphysical properties of the lithosphere that influence the Te: the thickness of the crust and\n\nlithospheric mantle; the crustal composition; the thermal state of the lithosphere; the state\n\nof stress and the local curvature of the lithosphere (Burov and Diament, 1995). Therefore\n\nthe determination of Te can be used to study the thermal and mechanical structure of the\n\nlithosphere.\n\nIn the present work, the flexure of the lithosphere is simulated using the thin elastic\n\nplate approximation. In the following sections, the numerical approach for the flexural\n\nisostasy of the lithosphere is described, as well as the comparison with analytical solutions.\n\n2.2 Flexure of a thin elastic plate and its numerical solution\n\nThe differential equation that describes the flexure w = w(x,y) of a thin elastic plate\n\nunder the vertical loads q is presented in equation 2.1.\n\n(L?)TDL?w ? q = 0 (2.1)\n\nwhere\n\n(L?) =\n[\n?2\n\n?x2\n,\n?2\n\n?y2\n, 2\n\n?2\n\n?x?y\n\n]T\n\nD = D\n\n?\n????\n\n1 ? 0\n\n? 1 0\n\n0 0 (1 ??)/2\n\n?\n???? .\n\nD = ET 3e /12[1 ? ?2] is the flexural rigidity of the plate, that depends on the Young\u2019s\n\nmodulus E, the Te = Te(x,y) and the Poisson\u2019s ratio ?. T indicates the transpose of a\n\n\n\nSection 2.2. Flexure of a thin elastic plate and its numerical solution 37\n\nmatrix. A detailed deduction of equation 2.1 is provided by Timoshenko and Woinowsky-\n\nKrieger (1959).\n\nThe numerical solution of equation 2.1 through the finite element method is presented\n\nby Zienkiewicz and Taylor (2000a) and is based on the principle of virtual work: for an\n\narbitrary displacement ?w of a plate ? out of the plane xy, the plate will be at equilibrium\n\nif the internal virtual work ??int (related to the deformations of the plate) and the external\n\nvirtual work ??ext (related to the loads applied on the plate) are equal:\n\n??int ? ??ext = 0. (2.2)\n\nThe internal and external virtual works for the thin elastic plate problem are given by\n\n(see Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000a)\n\n??int =\n\n?\n?\n\n?w(L?)TD(L?)wd? (2.3)\n\n??ext =\n\n?\n?\n\n?wqd? + b.c. (2.4)\n\nwhere the term b.c. represents boundary conditions of ?, necessary for the solution of the\n\nproblem and physically represents the link of the plate with adjacent regions.\n\nFor the study of lithospheric flexure, the load q can be decomposed into two components:\n\n1. due to the buoyancy force per unit area exerted by the asthenosphere ??mgw, where\n\n?m is the density of the asthenosphere and g is the gravity. The negative sign indicates\n\nthat the buoyancy force has the opposite sense of the deflection w;\n\n2. due to other loads q? related to topographic loads, sedimentary loads and thermal\n\nexpansion of the lithosphere, for example.\n\nIn the geoscience literature (e.g. Turcotte and Schubert, 1982), the buoyancy force\n\nterm is commonly represented as an effective buoyancy force, dependent on the difference\n\nof density between the asthenosphere and the material infilling the depressions at the\n\nsurface created during the deflection of the plate (?m ? ?infill). Here the buoyancy term\n\nis treated as dependent only on ?m and all the other external loads are merged in the q?\n\nterm. The reason for this procedure will be explained in detail in section 6.4, where the\n\ncoupling of the different processes that compose the numerical model is described.\n\n\n\n38 Chapter 2. Flexure and isostasy\n\nTherefore, the expression 2.4 can be rewritten as\n\n??ext =\n\n?\n?\n\n?w [q? ??mgw] d? + b.c. (2.5)\n\nThe function w can be approximated by w ? w? = Na where N = N(x,y) is a row\n\nvector containing interpolation functions called shape functions chosen a priori and a is\n\na column vector containing the unknown parameters. The shape functions used in this\n\nwork will be described in the next section. The virtual displacement ?w is replaced by\n\n?w = ?aTNT, where ?aT is a row vector containing arbitrary parameters.\n\nReplacing w and ?w in Eqs. 2.3 and 2.5, the equation 2.2 becomes\n\n?aT\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\nBTDBd? a ?\n?\n?\n\nNTq?d? +\n\n?\n?\n\nNT?mgNd? a\n\n?\n?? b.c. = 0 (2.6)\n\nwhere B = (L?)N.\n\nAs described by Zienkiewicz and Taylor (2000a), the boundary conditions b.c. can be\n\napproximated by b.c. ? ?aTfb. Using this approximation for b.c., the equation 2.6 becomes\n\nindependent of ?aT, resulting in the linear system\n\nKa = f (2.7)\n\nwhere\n\nKa =\n\n?\n?\n\n(\nBTDB + NT?mgN\n\n)\nd? a (2.8)\n\nf =\n\n?\n?\n\nNTq?d? + fb (2.9)\n\nK and f are usually called stiffness matrix and load vector, respectively.\n\n2.3 The choice of the finite element\n\nThere are dozens of different finite element types used to study the problem of bending\n\nof thin elastic plates (see Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000a). In the present work, triangular\n\nelements and the shape functions developed by Specht (1988) were adopted. This trian-\n\ngular element is composed of 3 nodes, each one with 3 degrees of freedom: the vertical\n\ndisplacement w and the partial derivatives of w with respect to x and y. Zienkiewicz and\n\n\n\nSection 2.3. The choice of the finite element 39\n\nTaylor (2000a) pointed out that this type of element is one of the best triangular elements\n\nwith 9 degrees of freedom currently available.\n\nThe domain ? is subdivided into triangular elements ?e (e = 1, . . . ,m), where m is\n\nthe number of elements. These m elements are interconnected by n nodes that are, in this\n\ncase, the vertices of the triangles. The function w? = Na is composed of\n\na =\n\n?\n??????????\n\na1\n\na2\n\na3\n...\n\nan\n\n?\n??????????\n\n(2.10)\n\nai = [w?i , ?xi , ?yi]\nT\n\n(2.11)\n\nN = [N1 , N2 , N3 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Nn] (2.12)\n\nNi =\n[\nNwi , N?xi , N?yi\n\n]\n(2.13)\n\nThe equation 2.11 shows that each node i has 3 degrees of freedom: (1) displacement\n\nw?i in the z direction, (2) rotation ?xi around the x axis and (3) rotation ?yi around the y\n\naxis.\n\nFor a certain point xp = (xp,yp) inside the element e, the functions Ni are\n\nNi(xp,yp) =\n\n??\n? N\n\ne\ni (xp,yp) if i is a vertex of e\n\n0 if i is not a vertex of e\n(2.14)\n\nand the shape functions for the element e with node i, j and k developed by Specht (1988)\n\nare\n\nNeTi =\n\n?\n????\nNewi\n\nNe?xi\n\nNe?yi\n\n?\n???? =\n\n?\n????\nPi ?Pi+3 + Pk+3 + 2(Pi+6 ?Pk+6)\n\n?bj(Pk+6 ?Pk+3) ? bkPi+6\n?cj(Pk+6 ?Pk+3) ? ckPi+6\n\n?\n????

But in the second example the magnitude of the errors is larger than in the\n\nprevious one. For the coarsest mesh (Le = 25 km), the difference between the numerical\n\nand analytical solutions reaches up to 16.8% of w0, the exact deflection under the line load.\n\nFor the finest mesh (Le = 6.25 km) the maximum error is smaller than 1.1% of w0.\n\n\n\n48 Chapter 2.

All the curves are divided by the modulus of the exact deflection |w0|\n\nunder the line load.\n\nThere are two reasons for the increase of the error in this second example: Firstly,\n\nit is known that for the same finite element mesh and using the shape functions derived\n\nby Specht (1988), the convergence to the analytical solution occurs faster for distributed\n\nloads than concentrated ones (see Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000a, section 4.8). Secondly,\n\nobserve that the largest discrepancy occurs to the left of the line load, where the flexural\n\nrigidity is low. For a finite element mesh with constant element size Le, it would be\n\nexpected that the error must be larger in the portions of the plate where it is less rigid,\n\nbecause the wavelength of the deflection in these regions is shorter than in other ones. The\n\ncharacteristic wavelength of the plate can be calculated through the flexural parameter ?\n\n\n\nSection 2.6.

Flexure and isostasy\n\nerrors in the numerical solution. This shows that the proposed finite element model to\n\nstudy the flexure of lithospheric plates is robust to incorporate lateral variation of rigidity.\n\nWith the appropriate choice of the finite element size Le, depending on the flexural rigidity\n\nof the plate, provides accurate solutions for the problem of bending of thin elastic plates.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nThermal model\n\nEarth\u2019s heat engine works in ways which\n\nstill elude us after many years of research,\n\nboth on the fundamental physical aspects of convection\n\nin the mantle and on securing new and precise observations.\n\n(Jaupart et al., 2007)\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nThe thermal structure of the crust and mantle is a key aspect to understand the mecha-\n\nnical behavior of the Earth in different tectonic settings. As pointed out in the beginning\n\nof the previous chapter, the temperature is one of the physical parameters that controls\n\nthe rheology of the lithosphere. Actually, laboratorial experiments and theoretical studies\n\nshow that the temperature is one of the most important physical parameter controlling\n\nthe rheology of solids (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982).\n\nBesides the rheological aspect, the variation in the thermal structure of the lithosphere\n\nleads to vertical movements of the surface due to thermal contraction or expansion of the\n\nlithosphere (e.g. Parsons and Sclater, 1977; McKenzie, 1978). Therefore the evolution of\n\nthe thermal structure of the lithosphere influences the topography and bathymetry and,\n\nconsequently, the surface processes through the geological time.\n\nThe variation in the thermal structure of the lithosphere occurs by heat transfer and\n\nthere are three mechanisms for the transport of heat: thermal diffusion, advection and ra-\n\ndiation. Thermal diffusion occurs by transfer of kinetic energy through collision of adjacent\n\nparticles that compose the material, without mass transport. This kind of heat transport\n\n\n\n52 Chapter 3. Thermal model\n\nis only possible when there is a spatial variation of the temperature in the medium. Unlike\n\nthe thermal diffusion, the advection is related to the transport of mass, i.e. the movement\n\nof the particles carries the heat to another place. The third way to transport heat, the\n\nelectromagnetic radiation, is important only in small scale due to the absorption of this\n\nenergy by the adjacent rocks and therefore can be treated as part of the thermal diffusion.\n\nThis radiative transport probably contributes as a minor component of the thermal diffu-\n\nsion because the mean free path of photons in the crust and mantle is very small (Ricard,\n\n2007). Therefore the transport of heat in the interior of the Earth can be described through\n\nthe advection and the thermal diffusion.\n\nIn the following sections, the heat transfer equation is presented as well as its numerical\n\ntreatment through the finite element method.\n\n3.2 Heat transfer equation and its numerical solution\n\nTo study the evolution of the temperature in the interior of the crust and mantle during\n\nand after tectonism, the transient, three dimensional heat transfer equation is considered\n\n(Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959)\n\n?c\n\n(\n?T\n\n?t\n+ v \u00b7?T\n\n)\n= ?T (kT?T) + ?Ar (3.1)\n\nwhere T is temperature, t is the time dimension, ? is density, c is the specific heat capacity,\n\nkT is conductivity, v = (uadv,vadv,wadv) is the advection velocity, Ar is the radioactive\n\nproduction and ? =\n[\n?\n?x\n, ?\n?y\n, ?\n?z\n\n]T\n. Note that T indicates the transpose of a matrix while\n\nT is the temperature. In this equation, the advection velocity v describes the velocity of\n\nrock particles in the interior of crust and mantle.\n\nIn equation 3.1, the first term represents the local variation of the temperature and\n\nthe second is the advective term. The two terms on the right side of the equation are the\n\ndiffusive term and the source term, respectively.\n\nAssume that equation 3.1 is valid in the domain ?V with the boundary ?V . The\n\nboundary conditions are\n\n(kT?T)\nT\n\nnV + q?H = 0 on ?V q (3.2)\n\nand\n\nT = T? on ?V T (3.3)\n\n\n\nSection 3.2. Heat transfer equation and its numerical solution 53\n\nwhere\n\n?V = ?V T ? ?V q (3.4)\n\nand\n\n? = ?V T ? ?V q. (3.5)\n\nThe superposed bar in equation 3.4 represents the set closure and ? in equation 3.5 is the\n\nempty set.\n\nThe equation 3.2 is the boundary condition that represents the prescribed heat flow\n\nq?H on ?V q, where nV is the unit vector normal to ?V and pointing outward of ?V . The\n\nequation 3.3 is the boundary condition imposing the temperature T? on ?V T .\n\nThe variational formulation for equation 3.1 with the boundary condition 3.2 is (see\n\nZienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000b, chapter 3)?\n?V\n\nvw\n\n[\n?c\n\n(\n?T\n\n?t\n+ v \u00b7?T\n\n)\n??T (kT?T) ??Ar\n\n]\nd?V +\n\n+\n\n?\n?V q\n\nvw\n\n[\n(kT?T)\n\nT\nnV + q?H\n\n]\nd?V = 0 (3.6)\n\nwhere vw is a scalar function. The boundary condition of equation 3.3 is automatically\n\nsatisfied by the choice of T on ?V T .\n\nThe diffusive term in equation 3.6 is integrated by parts\n\n?\n?\n\n?V\n\nvw\n\n[\n?T (kT?T)\n\n]\nd?V =\n\n?\n?V\n\n?TvwkT?Td?V ?\n?\n\n?V\n\nvw (kT?T)\nT\n\nnV d?V\n\nand equation 3.6 becomes?\n?V\n\nvw?c\n\n(\n?T\n\n?t\n+ v \u00b7?T\n\n)\n+ ?TvwkT?T ?vw?Ard?V +\n\n+\n\n?\n?V q\n\nvwq?Hd?V ?\n?\n\n?V T\n\nvw (kT?T)\nT\n\nnV d?V = 0. (3.7)\n\nAs the temperature is specified on ?V T (equation 3.3), the last term in equation 3.7 is\n\nomitted by restricting the choice of vw to functions which give vw = 0 on ?V T . If q?H = 0\n\non ?V q, this means that the normal gradient of temperature is zero\n\n?T\n\n?nV\n= (?T)T nV = 0 on ?V q\n\nand the integration on ?V q in equation 3.7 is zero. Therefore, under these conditions, the\n\nequation 3.7 can be simplified as?\n?V\n\nvw?c\n\n(\n?T\n\n?t\n+ v \u00b7?T\n\n)\n+ ?TvwkT?T ?vw?Ard?V = 0. (3.8)\n\n\n\n54 Chapter 3. Thermal model\n\nThe domain ?V is subdivided into elements ?\ne\nV (e = 1, . . . ,m), where m is the number\n\nof elements. These m elements are interconnected by n nodes.

Heat transfer equation and its numerical solution 55\n\nUnlike M and Kd, the matrix Ka, related to the advection velocity v, is non-symmetric.\n\nDue to this asymmetry, when the advection is the dominant process to transport heat, the\n\naccuracy of the numerical solution of equation 3.11 deteriorates and, in some cases, becomes\n\nunstable (see Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000c, chapter 2).\n\nTo improve the accuracy and stability of the solution, the streamline upwind Petrov-\n\nGalerkin process is applied (Hughes and Brooks, 1979, 1982; Zienkiewicz and Taylor, 2000c)\n\nand the equation 3.11 is replaced by\n\nMa?T + (K\n?\na + Kc) aT = F\n\nMa?T + KT aT = F (3.16)\n\nwhere\n\nK?a =\n\n?\n?V\n\nN?TV ?cv \u00b7 BV d?V (3.17)\n\nN?V i = NV i +\n?opth\n\nev \u00b7?NV i\n2|v|\n\n?opt = coth Pe?\n1\n\nPe\n\nPe =\n|v|he\n\n2kT\n.\n\nhe is the characteristic element size in the direction of the advection velocity v and will be\n\ndefined in the next section.\n\nThe discretization in time is done following the implicit scheme adopted by Braun\n\n(2003):\naT (t + ?t) ? aT (t)\n\n?t\n= ?a?T (t + ?t) + (1 ??)a?T (t) (3.18)\n\nwhere ? is a weighting parameter adopted here equal to 0.5. Multiplying both sides by\n\nM(t + ?t), the equation 3.18 becomes\n\nM(t + ?t)\naT (t + ?t) ? aT (t)\n\n?t\n= ?M(t + ?t)a?T (t + ?t) + (1 ??)M(t + ?t)a?T (t).\n\nAssuming that M(t + ?t) ? M(t) and using the equation 3.16, results in\n\nM(t + ?t)\naT (t + ?t) ? aT (t)\n\n?t\n= ? [F(t + ?t) ? KT (t + ?t)aT (t + ?t)] +\n\n+(1 ??) [F(t) ? KT (t)aT (t)] .\n\n\n\n56 Chapter 3. Thermal model\n\nRearranging the terms, the following equation is obtained\n\n[M(t + ?t) + ?t?KT (t + ?t)] aT (t + ?t) =\n\n= [M(t + ?t) ? ?t(1 ??)KT (t)] aT (t) + ?t [?F(t + ?t) + (1 ??)F(t)] .(3.19)\n\n3.3 The choice of the finite element\n\nThe linear tetrahedron is the finite element used in the three dimensional heat transfer\n\nproblem. Therefore, the domain ?V is subdivided into m tetrahedral elements, intercon-\n\nnected by n nodes. As previously presented, the function T? = NV aT is composed of\n\naT = [aT1, aT2, aT3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , aTn]\nT\n\n(3.20)\n\nNV = [NV 1, NV 2, NV 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , NV n] . (3.21)\n\nUnlike the flexural model, in the thermal model each node has only one degree of\n\nfreedom: the temperature.\n\nFor a certain point xp = (xp,yp,zp) inside the element e, the function NV i is\n\nNV i(xp,yp,zp) =\n\n??\n? N\n\ne\nV i(xp,yp,zp) if i is a vertex of e\n\n0 if i is not a vertex of e\n(3.22)\n\nand the shape functions for the element e with nodes i, j, k and l are\n\nNeV i = LV 1(xp) =\nVolume pjkl\nVolume ijkl\n\n, NeV j = LV 2(xp) =\nVolume ipkl\nVolume ijkl\n\n,\n\nNeV k = LV 3(xp) =\nVolume ijpl\nVolume ijkl\n\n, NeV l = LV 4(xp) =\nVolume ijkp\nVolume ijkl\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhere LV \u2019s are the local coordinates for the tetrahedral element and Volume ijkl represents\n\nthe volume of the tetrahedron formed by the nodes i, j, k and l, and so on. The denomi-\n\nnator represents the volume of the tetrahedral element and the numerator represents the\n\nvolume of the sub-tetrahedra composed of three nodes of the tetrahedral element plus the\n\ninternal node p (Figure 3.1). Since the sum of the volumes of the four sub-tetrahedra is\n\nequal to the total volume of the tetrahedral element, the sum of the shape functions for\n\nan element e is:\n\nLV 1(xp) + LV 2(xp) + LV 3(xp) + LV 4(xp) = 1\n\n\n\nSection 3.3.

One challenging aspect is to understand the\n\ndiversity of rift styles observed on Earth. Rifts can be narrow or wide (England, 1983) and\n\npresent different \u201cdegrees\u201d of asymmetry between the conjugate margins. Furthermore,\n\nthe influence of magmatism during rifting varies widely and many rifts fail and do not\n\nevolve to passive margins. In spite of this variety of rift styles, rifted regions are generally\n\ncharacterized by crustal thinning, high heat flow, negative Bouguer anomalies and uplif-\n\nted margins (Allen and Allen, 2005) and these similarities were the starting point for the\n\ngeodynamic study of rifts.\n\nA strategy to study the rift of the lithosphere is through kinematic models to describe\n\nthe strain field during stretching. This kind of model was successfully applied by McKenzie\n\n(1978), where he presented an elegant analytical formulation that quantifies the gross\n\npattern of subsidence for basins in divergent margins, identifying two stages of subsidence:\n\nthe first one related to stretching and thinning of the lithosphere; and a second one caused\n\nby the thermal cooling of the lithosphere.\n\nIn the model of McKenzie (1978), the lithosphere is stretched instantaneously and the\n\n\n\n68 Chapter 4. Stretching of the lithosphere\n\nstretch is uniform with depth, by pure-shear (Figure 4.1a). There is no lateral heat transfer\n\nand local isostasy is assumed, i.e. the rigidity of the lithosphere is null.\n\n(a) McKenzie [1978]\n\n(b) Royden and Keen [1980]\n\n(c) Wernicke [1985]\n\nupper plate\nlower plate\n\nFigure 4.1: Comparison between different models to represent the stretching of the\n\nlithosphere. The left panels show the lithospheric configuration previous to stretching, while\n\nthe right ones show the final state of the lithosphere after stretching. The dark gray region is\n\nthe crust and the light gray one is the lithospheric mantle. (a) Pure shear model of McKen-\n\nzie (1978), where the stretching is uniform. The dashed lines bound the stretched regions.\n\n(b) Non-uniform pure shear model of Royden and Keen (1980). (c) Simple shear model of\n\nWernicke (1985).\n\nIn the following years, this simple model was improved. Jarvis and McKenzie (1980)\n\nconsidered finite rates of extension and therefore the rift is not instantaneous as in the\n\nmodel of McKenzie (1978). Studying the subsidence history of the Labrador shelf, Royden\n\nand Keen (1980) observed that the Mckenzie\u2019s model cannot describe the evolution of this\n\nmargin. They concluded that the mantle under the Labrador margin was considerably\n\nmore extended than the crust to fit the subsidence curve. Later, this variation of extension\n\nwith depth was observed in other margins (e.g. Roberts et al., 1997; Driscoll and Karner,\n\n1998). Royden and Keen (1980) proposed a model that consider the effect of non-uniform\n\nstretch with depth, assuming that the extension of the crust and lithospheric mantle are\n\nindependent (Figure 4.1b). Although the model of Royden and Keen (1980) reasonably\n\n\n\nSection 4.1. Introduction 69\n\ndescribes the subsidence of margins with non-uniform stretch with depth, their model\n\npresents problems of mass conservation during stretching (Figure 4.1b).\n\nWernicke (1985) proposed a simple shear model to describe the stretching of the litho-\n\nsphere, where a low-angle detachment fault divides the lithosphere into two portions: an\n\nupper plate or hangingwall, and a lower plate or footwall (Figure 4.1c). Unlike the model\n\nof Royden and Keen (1980), in the simple shear model the mass is conserved during\n\nstretching. This model implies asymmetric conjugate margins, where the lithospheric\n\nmantle is more extended than the crust in the upper plate margin, while in the lower plate\n\nmargin the crust is more extended than the mantle. On the other hand, Driscoll and Karner\n\n(1998) observed that many rifted margins, including conjugate ones, are characterized by\n\nlithospheric mantle much more stretched than the crust. They coined this as the upper\n\nplate paradox.\n\nCombination of the pure shear and simple shear was presented by Kusznir et al. (1991),\n\nwhere the upper-crust is stretched following a simple shear deformation pattern, while the\n\nlower crust and lithospheric mantle are stretched following the pure shear style. Kusznir\n\net al. (1991) included in their model the flexural cantilever effect to describe the flexural\n\nbehavior of the upper crust during stretching, producing uplift of footwall. This model\n\nalso simulates the formation of small wavelength features of few kilometers, describing\n\nthe geometry of grabens and crustal block rotation. Previous to Kusznir et al. (1991),\n\nWeissel and Karner (1989) applied the flexural cantilever model for the entire lithosphere\n\nto describe the flexural response of the plate to extension.\n\nBraun and Beaumont (1989) showed the importance of consider the finite strength\n\nof the lithosphere during stretching and introduced the concept of necking depth, which\n\nis defined as the depth in the lithosphere that remains horizontal during stretching if\n\nno isostatic compensation is applied. Physically the necking depth is close to the layer\n\nof maximum strength in the lithosphere. If the necking depth is shallow (Figure 4.2),\n\ne.g. representing a strong crust, the addition of isostatic forces produces a down warping\n\nof the rift zone. On the other hand, a deep necking depth, associated with the isostatic\n\nforces, produces an upward movement of the rift zone, creating flank uplifts.\n\nIn spite of the different formalisms, the flexural cantilever and the necking depth mo-\n\ndels agree that the lithosphere retains flexural rigidity during extension, and the regional\n\n\n\n70 Chapter 4. Stretching of the lithosphere\n\nisostatic compensation produces permanent flank uplifts as observed in many divergent\n\nmargins around the world.\n\nshallow\nnecking\ndepth\n\ndeep\nnecking\ndepth\n\nKinematic model Regional isostatic response\n\nFigure 4.2: Illustration of lithospheric necking and the regional isostatic response to stret-\n\nching (Braun and Beaumont, 1989). The left panels show the kinematic model for a shallow\n\n(upper figure) and deep (lower figure) necking depth without isostatic compensation. The\n\ndashed lines represent the necking depth and the gray region is the lithosphere. The right\n\npanels show the combination of stretching and regional isostatic response of the lithosphere.\n\nKusznir and Karner (2007) and Fletcher et al. (2009) proposed that the deformation of\n\nthe lithosphere during stretching is similar to previous models for the evolution of oceanic\n\ncrust and mid ocean ridges (Reid and Jackson, 1981). In this model (Figure 4.3), the\n\nupward movement of the mantle is maximum under the zone of stretching. Close to the\n\nsurface, the upward movement diverges laterally and reaches the highest horizontal velocity\n\nat the surface.\n\nKusznir and Karner (2007) proposed that the deformation and thinning of the conti-\n\nnental lithosphere guided by the upwelling divergent flow field naturally leads to breakup\n\nand formation of sea-floor spreading. This model successfully predicted depth-dependent\n\nstretching, resulting in \u201cupper plate\u201d behavior on both conjugate margins.\n\nIn the present work, different aspects of these previous models were used to study\n\nthe stretching of the lithosphere. The upwelling divergent flow was used to describe the\n\nstretching pattern of the lithospheric mantle and lower crust during rifting. To simulate\n\nthe creation of faults and the flexural response to faulting of the upper crust, the flexural\n\ncantilever model of Kusznir et al. (1991) was used.

(4.2)\n\nUx is the half-spreading horizontal velocity at the surface and Uz is the axial vertical\n\nvelocity at x = 0, the center of the rift.\n\nThe advection velocity v = (uadv,vadv,wadv) is the same used in equation 3.1 to describe\n\nthe velocity of rock particles during stretching of the lithosphere.\n\n\n\n72 Chapter 4.

Depth is in km.\n\nIn this model there are two parameters to be adjusted: the horizontal velocity Ux\n\nand the vertical velocity Uz. Ux can be derived from the relative movement between\n\ndivergent lithospheric plates. On the other hand, Uz cannot be directly measured. For a\n\npassive divergent flow with constant viscosity, the ratio Uz/Ux = 2/? (Morgan, 1987), thus\n\nUz &lt;Ux in this situation. But considering that the viscosity is dependent on stress and\n\ntemperature, Fletcher et al. (2009) proposed that the ratio Uz/Ux must be higher than\n\nexpected by the passive isoviscous flow.\n\n\n\nSection 4.3. The flexural cantilever model 73\n\nIn Figure 4.4a is presented the velocity field for the upwelling divergent flow with\n\nUz/Ux = 1. Due to symmetry, only half of the velocity field is plotted. Observe that\n\nthe vectorial field shown in Figure 4.4a is independent of the absolute value of Ux or Uz,\n\ndepending only on the ratio Uz/Ux. From an observer moving with the surface with velocity\n\nUx relative to the axis of the upwelling flow (Figure 4.4b) it is easy to verify that the lower\n\nportion of the lithosphere flows oceanward. This shows the depth-dependent stretching of\n\nthe lithosphere in this model.\n\n4.3 The flexural cantilever model\n\nThe Figure 4.5 exemplifies the flexural cantilever model. In this model, the footwall\n\nand hanging wall (Figure 4.5a) interact as flexural cantilevers during planar faulting of the\n\nupper crust. Under the upper crust, the lower crust flows to accommodate the faulting\n\nand the density of the upper and lower crust are the same.\n\n(a)\n\nCrust\nFootwall\n\nCrust\nHanging wall\n\n(b)\n\nCrust\n\nCrust\n\nE\n\n(c)\nbuoyancy forceE\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 4.5: Diagram describing the flexural cantilever model of Kusznir et al.

The final\n\nconfiguration is shown in Figure 4.5d and the resulting topographic variation is\n\nw?F = wF + df\n\nObserve that in this case the fluid that produces the isostatic compensation is the lower\n\ncrust, and not the mantle. This is the reason for the appearance of ?c in the second term\n\nof equation 4.3.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nSurface processes\n\nOverall, we have learned two things:\n\n1 It is not hard to invent plausible stratigraphic models.\n\n2 It is very hard to test them.\n\n(Paola, 2000)\n\n5.1 Introduction\n\nIn the present work, the meaning of surface processes encompasses subaerial and sub-\n\nmarine processes of erosion, transport and deposition of sediments.\n\nIn spite of the clear relationship between erosion of emerged regions and deposition in\n\nthe sedimentary basins, quantitative models tend to treat them independently, with few\n\nexceptions (e.g. Johnson and Beaumont, 1995; van Balen et al., 1995; Garcia-Castellanos,\n\n2002). Therefore, through the last decades, the parallel development of quantitative models\n\nof sedimentary basin filling and landscape evolution models has occurred almost isolated\n\nfrom each other.\n\nThe first quantitative basin filling models to simulate clastic sequence stratigraphy were\n\nbased on two-dimensional geometric models (e.g. Pitman, 1978), where the geometry of the\n\nsediment surface is previously prescribed and the evolution of the basin filling depends on\n\nthe imposed sediment supply and variations in the sea-level. These models were followed\n\nby dynamic models based on equations of conservation of mass and \u201crules\u201d guiding the\n\ntransport of sediments. For example Jordan and Flemings (1991), Riven\u00e6s (1992) and\n\nRiven\u00e6s (1997) used linear diffusion to simulate the sediment transport on continental\n\nshelves. Kaufman et al. (1991) proposed a depth-dependent diffusivity to simulate the\n\n\n\n76 Chapter 5. Surface processes\n\ndecrease in energy available for sediment transport with increasing water depth. One of\n\nthe limitations of diffusion based stratigraphic models is that the diffusion tends to spread\n\nthe sediments and flatten the bathymetry, does not producing the characteristic feature of\n\nprograding clinoforms as observed in seismic sections. Considering the depth-dependent\n\ndiffusivity, the flattening process is diminished. To reproduce the clinoform geometry,\n\nPirmez et al. (1998), followed by Driscoll and Karner (1999), proposed a advective-diffusive\n\nmodel of sediment transport. The advective term in this model represents the residual\n\nriver current carrying sediments into deep water. On the other hand, both diffusional\n\nand advective-diffusional models are empirical equations and they try to represent the\n\ncombination of different physical and chemical processes acting in the depositional setting.\n\nUntil now, it is not clear what is the best first-order dynamic equation to describe the\n\nevolution of clastic shelves (Paola, 2000). Despite of the lack of a clear dynamic equation,\n\nthe reviewed models predict useful stratigraphic evolution of basin filling.\n\nThe development of numerical models to study landscape evolution started in the 1970s\n\n[Ahnert 1976 in Coulthard 2001]. In the following years, new numerical models were deve-\n\nloped showing improved descriptions of the different processes involved in the evolution of\n\nthe landscape, as well as its geometric discretization (Kirkby, 1986; Willgoose et al., 1991;\n\nBeaumont et al., 1992; Tucker and Slingerland, 1994; Braun and Sambridge, 1997; Tucker\n\nand Bras, 2000). A detailed revision of the different models is presented by Coulthard\n\n(2001). Basically, the processes that sculpt the landscape in these numerical models are\n\ndescribed as short- and long-range processes. Short-range processes describe the transport\n\nof sediments and the erosion along hillslopes, such as soil creep, earth flows, slides and rock-\n\nfall (Kooi and Beaumont, 1994). These processes depend on the local slope, the soil type,\n\nvegetation and climate. In the numerical models, the short range processes are simula-\n\nted through linear diffusion (e.g. Kooi and Beaumont, 1994), non-linear diffusion (Martin,\n\n2000) or dependent on critical slope angle for soil movement by sliding (Densmore et al.,\n\n1998). The long-range processes describe the cumulative effect of fluvial transport either\n\nas bedload or in suspension (Beaumont et al., 1992). Besides the local slope, lithology and\n\nvegetation, the long-range processes are dependent on water discharge, that is dependent\n\non precipitation and drainage area. If the effective precipitation is assumed uniform over\n\nthe surface, the water discharge is proportional to the drainage area. There are other\n\n\n\nSection 5.2. Mathematical description of the surface processes 77\n\nmodels that take into account glacial erosion (Braun et al., 1999), chemical weathering\n\n(Kaufmann and Braun, 2001) and aeolian systems (conceptual model of Kocurek and\n\nHavholm, 1993), but they are not discussed in the present work.\n\nAll these models try to study the large-scale long-term evolution of the surface proces-\n\nses. They represent a simple description of the complex processes that occur in different\n\ntime and space scales in the real world. About this aspect, Kooi and Beaumont (1994)\n\nwrote: \u201cAs demonstrated in other sciences, a fruitful approach to such problems of scale\n\nis to set aside (for the time being) the small-scale, short-timescale picture and to explore\n\nsimple relationships cast in terms of large-scale, long-timescale quantities. In thermody-\n\nnamics, for example, the behavior of gases was first formulated in terms of properties\n\nassociated with the collective behavior of molecules (pressure, temperature, and entropy)\n\nand not the interactions between individual molecules\u201d.\n\nThe following sections present the mathematical description of the surface processes\n\nused in the present work, showing the discretization of the surface and the numerical\n\ntreatment of each process.\n\n5.2 Mathematical description of the surface processes\n\nIn this work, the landscape evolution is guided by two types of processes (Beaumont\n\net al., 1992): short-range hillslope processes, like weathering and soil creep; and long-range\n\nfluvial process.\n\nHillslope processes are modeled through a linear diffusion equation applied to topo-\n\ngraphy h, assuming that transport is linearly proportional to the slope (see Dietrich et al.\n\n(2003) and references therein):\n?h\n\n?t\n= ?\u00b7 (kd?h) (5.1)\n\nwhere kd is the coefficient of diffusive transport.\n\nFluvial processes of erosion, transport and sedimentation are modeled following the\n\nformulation of Beaumont et al. (1992) where local variations in topography are described\n\nthrough a first-order reaction equation given by:\n\n?h\n\n?t\n= ?\n\nq\neqb\nf ? qf\nLf\n\n(5.2)\n\n\n\n78 Chapter 5. Surface processes\n\nwhere q\neqb\nf is the maximum sediment transport capacity, qf is the sediment flux per unit\n\nwidth [L2T?1] and Lf is a parameter of erosion/deposition with dimension of [L]. q\neqb\nf in\n\na channel takes the following form:\n\nq\neqb\nf = kfqr|?h| (5.3)\n\nwhere kf is the erosional coefficient due to the fluvial process, qr is water discharge and\n\n|?h| is the modulus of topographic gradient. The water discharge is calculated by spatially\n\nintegrating the net precipitation rate vR, which is assumed uniform in space and time for\n\nsimplicity. There are different expressions for q\neqb\nf in the literature, where the exponents\n\nof qr and |?h| are not equal to one (see Braun (2006)). These variations in the value of\n\nthe exponents of qr and |?h| are of secondary importance for the present work, since the\n\ngeneral drainage pattern and the position of the drainage divides will not be significantly\n\nmodified with the variation of the exponents (see Figure 9 in Tucker and Whipple, 2002).\n\nThe methodology of van Balen et al. (1995) is used for the offshore transport of sedi-\n\nments, based on the same principle as for diffusion processes on land, but with a non-linear\n\ndiffusion coefficient, km. Thus,\n?h\n\n?t\n= ?\u00b7 (km?h) (5.4)\n\nIn this simple model, the diffusivity km decreases exponentially with water depth, simula-\n\nting the decrease in energy available for sediment transport with increasing water depth:\n\nkm = k\n?\nm exp\n\n(\nh?hs.l.\nh0\n\n)\nk?m is a constant [L\n\n2T?1], hs.l. is sea level and h0 is another constant that has dimension of\n\n[L].\n\n5.3 Generation of the irregular mesh and discretization of the surface\n\n5.3.1 Irregular distribution of the points\n\nTo represent the surface of the numerical model, an irregular mesh was adopted (Braun\n\nand Sambridge, 1997). The main reason to use irregular meshes is the possibility to\n\nadapt the mesh to appropriately deal with the landscape evolution during faulting of the\n\nupper crust and simulate continuos horizontal movement between crutal blocks without\n\n\n\nSection 5.3. Generation of the irregular mesh and discretization of the surface 79\n\nloss of short-wavelength features (Braun and Sambridge, 1997). Besides the facility to deal\n\nwith relative movement of blocks, irregular meshes eliminate the artificial symmetry effect\n\nobserved in regular grids.\n\nA fast way to produce an irregular mesh with uniform point density is to perturb the\n\nposition of the points of a regular mesh in a random manner\n\nxi ? xri + ?rrand\n\nyi ? yri + ?rrand\n\nwhere xri = (xri,yri) is the point of the grid, xi = (xi,yi) is the new point of the irregular\n\nmesh, ?r is the distance between two adjacent points in the grid and rand is a random\n\nnumber centered in zero controlling the magnitude of the perturbation. Only the nodes\n\non the edge of the grid are maintained on the edge to preserve the rectangular geometry\n\nof the mesh.\n\n5.3.2 Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagrams\n\nAfter the creation of the points of the mesh, the connectivity between them is deter-\n\nmined. The first step is to discover the adjacent points for each point, named here as\n\nneighbor points. Due to the initial perturbation of the grid, the neighbor points in the\n\nirregular mesh do not necessarily coincide with the adjacent points in the previous grid,\n\nand the task of identifying them is not trivial and requires a special way to interconnect\n\nthe points.\n\nIn the present work, the interconnection between the points of the irregular mesh\n\n(Figure 5.1a) is done through the Delaunay triangulation (Delaunay, 1934). An example\n\nis shown in Figure 5.1b. This triangulation has the property of maximize the minimum\n\ninner angle of all created triangle. This means that from all the possible ways to create the\n\ntriangular mesh over n points, the Delaunay triangulation results in triangles \u201ccloser\u201d to\n\nequilateral triangles. Another property of this triangulation is that a circle circumscribed\n\non any Delaunay triangle does not contain any other point of the mesh.\n\nThe algorithm used to generate the triangular mesh is based on the works of Sloan\n\n(1987) and Fortune (1992). Initially the mesh is constructed with a minimum number of\n\npoints of the border that encompasses all the other points of the mesh. For an example,\n\n\n\n80 Chapter 5. Surface processes\n\nfor a rectangular mesh, only four points and two triangles are needed to initiate the tri-\n\nangulation, as in the example of Figure 5.2, first picture. After this, a new point is added\n\nto the mesh, verifying which circles circumscribed on the preexisting triangles contain the\n\nnew point. In this case, the respective triangles (indicated as light gray triangles in Figure\n\n5.2) are erased, and only the points of these triangles, together with the new point, are\n\nused to locally remake the mesh. Successively, all the other points are added and the mesh\n\nis locally updated in each step (Figure 5.2).\n\nTo determine whether a point xp = (xp,yp) is inside a circle circumscribing a triangle\n\ncomposed of the points x1, x2 and x3, ordered in the anti-clockwise sense, the following\n\ndeterminant is calculated\n\nDinside =\n\n????????????\n\nx1 y1 x\n2\n1 + y\n\n2\n1 1\n\nx2 y2 x\n2\n2 + y\n\n2\n2 1\n\nx3 y3 x\n2\n3 + y\n\n2\n3 1\n\nxp yp x\n2\np + y\n\n2\np 1\n\n????????????\n.\n\nIf Dinside > 0, the point xp is inside the circle.\n\nAfter the determination of the triangular mesh, the next step is determine the area\n\nassociated with each point of the mesh. For this, the Voronoi diagram is used (Voronoi,\n\n1908). An example of this diagram is presented in Figure 5.1c. This diagram divides the\n\nplane in polygons named Voronoi cells. The Voronoi cell associated with the point xP\n\nrepresents the region in the plane that is closest to this point than any other point of the\n\nmesh.\n\nThe Voronoi diagram is a dual graph of the Delaunay triangulation. This means that\n\nit is possible to associate each vertex of the Delaunay triangulation with a Voronoi cell,\n\nand each edge of the triangles with one edge of the cells (Figure 5.1d). This implies that\n\nthe Voronoi cells are obtained from the Delaunay triangulation.\n\nIn this work, the algorithm of Lasserre (1983) was used to determine the area of each\n\nVoronoi cell from the triangular mesh. The area Si of a Voronoi cell (Figure 5.3), related\n\nto the point i is given by\n\nSi =\n1\n\n2\n\nni?\nj\n\n|?Sij|\n\n?\n? bij?\n\na2xij + a\n2\nyij\n\n?\n?\n\n\n\nSection 5.3.

Formulation of the surface processes in the irregular mesh 85\n\n5.4 Formulation of the surface processes in the irregular mesh\n\nAfter the creation of the irregular mesh, each cell i of the Voronoi diagram is associated\n\nwith an elevation hi. In this model, the elevation in each cell is assumed to be constant,\n\nresulting in a topography resembling \u201ccolumnar jointing in basalts\u201d (Figure 5.4a). On\n\nthe other hand, although the calculations of the surface processes are based on the flat\n\ntop of the Voronoi cells, it is more convenient to render the topography using Delaunay\n\ntriangulation, reducing the number of polygons to be displayed (Figure 5.4b).\n\nThe geometric parameters needed to numerically calculate the surface processes are\n\n(for a specific cell i): the elevation hi; the cell area Si; the edge length ?Sij between the\n\ncell i and the neighbor cell j and the distance Lij between i and j (see Figure 5.3).\n\n5.4.1 Onshore and offshore diffusion\n\nThe diffusion, both in equation 5.1 for hillslope transport and in equation 5.4 for offshore\n\ntransport, is numerically calculated through an explicit finite volume approximation.\n\nTherefore, the variation in elevation ?hi due to diffusion for the cell i during the time\n\nstep ?t is\n?hi\n?t\n\n= ?\u00b7 (kdiff?hi)\n\nwhere kdiff can be either kd or km.\n\nIntegrating both sides in the cell area Si (observing that ?hi is constant in Si):\n\nSi\n?hi\n?t\n\n=\n\n?\nSi\n\n?\u00b7 (kdiff?hi) dS.\n\nApplying the divergence theorem to the right side:\n\nSi\n?hi\n?t\n\n=\n\n?\n?Si\n\nkdiff?hi \u00b7~ndl.\n\nThe line integral can be calculated as the sum of the integrals in each of the edges ?Sij\n\nSi\n?hi\n?t\n\n=\n?\nj\n\n?\n?Sij\n\nkdiff?hi \u00b7~ndl.\n\nIn each segment ?Sij, the integrand is constant, and can be approximated as\n\nkdiff?hi \u00b7~n ??kdiff\nhi ?hj\nLij\n\nin ?Sij\n\n\n\n86 Chapter 5.

(5.5)\n\nThis expression is the space-time integrated form of equation 5.3, where Q\neqb\nfi = q\n\neqb\nf ?tSi/Lij,\n\nQri = qr?tSi/Lij and |?h| ?\nhi?hj\nLij\n\n. Qri represents the cumulative volume of water that\n\nflows to the cell i from upstream cells u plus the local precipitation vRi during the time\n\nstep ?t:\n\nQri =\n?\nu\n\nQru + vRiSi?t. (5.6)\n\nIf the sediment volume Qfi transported is greater than Q\neqb\nfi , deposition takes place in\n\ncell i as follows\n\n?hi =\nQfi ?Q\n\neqb\nfi\n\nSi\n(5.7)\n\nand the sediment volume transported in cell j is updated\n\nQfj ?

(5.10)\n\nTo calculate the cumulative volume of water Qr in each cell, the first step is to sort the\n\nnodes from the upstream cells to the downstream ones. For this, it is assumed that water\n\nflows from one cell to the other through the steepest direction, as shown in Figure 5.4c,\n\nfollowing the edges of the Delaunay triangulation (Figure 5.4d).\n\nThe cascade algorithm developed by Braun and Sambridge (1997) is used to calculate\n\nthe discharge. This algorithm is as follows, with few modifications here:\n\n\n\nSection 5.5.

This displacement is the sum of the components related\n\nto faulting df (see section 4.3) and the flexural response of the upper crust and lithosphere,\n\nrespectively wF and w:\n\nwt = w + wF + df.\n\n\n\nSection 6.3. Flexure and isostatic compensation 97\n\nObserve that ?h is the variation of topography related only to the surface processes of\n\nerosion (?h &lt;0) and deposition (?h > 0). Therefore ?h is independent of the flexural\n\nresponse of the lithosphere. On the other hand, the variation in topography ?h induces\n\nvertical loads Fsp in the lithosphere which are regionally compensated by the lithosphere\n\nresulting in a vertical displacement wt of the surface.\n\nTo calculate the vector load f for the flexural model (equation 2.20), the load Fsp from\n\nthe irregular mesh must be interpolated to the finite element mesh of the flexural model\n\n(Figure 6.7a).\n\n(a) (b)\n\ni\n\ne\n\nFigure 6.7: (a) Superposition of the Voronoi cells of the surface processes model on the triangular finite\n\nelement mesh of the flexural model. (b) Approximation for the load of the surface processes, assuming\n\nthat loading in one cell is concentrated on the node at the center of the cell. The figure shows the five\n\ncells that contribute with the load on the highlighted triangular element.\n\nOne strategy to rapidly calculate the load from the irregular mesh to the finite element\n\nmodel is to assume that the load in each cell is concentrated on the node at the center of the\n\ncell. This approximation avoids the calculation of all partial areas of the cells superposed\n\non the triangular elements.\n\nTherefore, for a node i of the surface mesh inside the triangular element e (Figure 6.7b),\n\nthe contribution of the load of the cell i on the element e is (see equation 2.20)\n\nfCell i = f\ne\n\nCell i =\n\n?\n?e\n\nNTq?Cell id? = N\nT\n(xi,yi)\n\nFspSi\n\nwhere N is the row vector containing the shape functions (see section 2.3) and Si is the\n\n\n\n98 Chapter 6. Coupling of the processes\n\narea of the Voronoi cell i. For illustration, the element e in the Figure 6.7b is loaded by\n\nfive cells.\n\nThis approximation is reasonable for two reasons: Firstly the area of the finite elements\n\nis relatively larger than the cell area. In the illustration of Figure 6.7b the ratio between\n\nelement area and the cell area is nearly 4.5, but in the numerical models presented in this\n\nwork, this ratio is around 20. Secondly the flexural rigidity of the plate tends to smooth\n\nthe effect of local variation of the load.\n\nAfter the solution of the flexural equation, the deflection of the plate is interpolated to\n\nthe irregular mesh:\n\nwi = wt1L1 + wt2L2 + wt3L3\n\nwhere wi is the interpolated deflection in the node i, wt1, wt2 and wt3 are the deflections at\n\nthe nodes of the finite element e, and L1, L2 and L3 are the areal coordinates (see section\n\n2.3) for the element e at the point (xi,yi).\n\n6.4 The \u201cwater load delay\u201d algorithm\n\nThe isostatic term in the equation for the flexural isostasy is usually described as\n\ndependent on the difference of density ?? between the asthenosphere and the fluid at the\n\nsurface displaced during the isostatic adjustment of the plate.\n\nFor example, during erosion of the continents, the isostatic response of the lithosphere\n\ndisplaces the air. As the density of the air is negligible, the difference of density ?? is equal\n\nto the density of the asthenosphere (?? = ?m ??air = ?m). But the isostatic response of\n\nthe lithosphere to sedimentation in the offshore basins results in subsidence that is filled\n\nwith water, amplifying the subsidence. In this case the density of the water is not negligible\n\nand ?? = ?m??w. Therefore, the value of ?? depends whether the isostatic compensation\n\nis subaerial or submarine. Since the position of the shoreline changes through time during\n\nthe simulation of the surface processes, ?? is dependent on time and space.\n\nThe stiffness matrix K in equation 2.8 for the flexural problem is dependent on the\n\nisostatic term, implying that the stiffness matrix must be rewritten every time ?? is\n\nmodified, which is time consuming.\n\nTo avoid the modification of K due to variations in ??, in the present work the bu-\n\n\n\nSection 6.4. The \u201cwater load delay\u201d algorithm 99\n\noyancy term is treated as dependent only on the density of the asthenosphere ?m and the\n\nadditional load associated with variations of the water layer during isostatic compensation\n\nis incorporated in the load q? in equation 2.9.\n\nTo illustrate this procedure, consider equation 2.1 with the isostatic term shown expli-\n\ncitly:\n\n(L?)TDL?w + ??gw = q? (6.5)\n\nIn the submarine domain ?? = ?m ??w. Therefore:\n\n(L?)TDL?w + ?mgw = q? + ?wgw (6.6)\n\nIn equation 6.6 the last term is the additional water load related to the isostatic compen-\n\nsation of the plate to the load q?. Clearly the water load cannot be treated explicitly as the\n\nload for the equation, because it depends on the solution w of the equation. One approxi-\n\nmation is to use the known water load of the previous time step ?wgwt??t to calculate the\n\nnew deflection wt:\n\n(L?)TDL?wt + ?mgwt = q? + ?wgwt??t (6.7)\n\nIn this expression, the isostatic term is dependent only on the density of the asthenosphere\n\n?m and the stiffness matrix K does not need to be rewritten every time step. This appro-\n\nximation is named here as the \u201cwater load delay\u201d approximation.\n\nObserve that the equation 6.7 is applicable to the onshore domain if the last term is\n\nomitted.\n\nTo show that this new approximation for the isostatic compensation presented in equa-\n\ntion 6.7 converges to the exact solution, an analytical proof is given in Appendix B.\n\n\n\n100 Chapter 6.

In the first section, the model is applied to\n\nstudy how different rift styles influence the evolution of escarpments in divergent margins.\n\nThe main result from this work is that the position of the drainage divide is strongly\n\ndependent on the amount of extension in the rifted margin. Moreover, the models show\n\nthat the retreating escarpment scenario is unlikely when the lower crust under the rift flank\n\nis substantially stretched. These results are applied to study the evolution of the margins\n\nin Southeastern Australia and Southeastern Brazil. In the second section, the model is\n\nused to study the influence of post-rift thermal anomalies at the base of the lithosphere\n\nand how the stratigraphic sequence is affected by isostatic response of the lithosphere to\n\nthe transient thermal anomaly. As an example, a possible influence of the passage of the\n\nTrindade Plume on the marginal basins of Campos and Espirito Santo is discussed.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the conclusions of the present work are based on the\n\nresults of numerical models that represent a simplification of the real world. Certainly,\n\nmany other processes may affect the evolution of the margin. However, the proposed\n\nintegrated numerical models quantify the relative influence of flexure, thermal effects,\n\nstretching styles and surface processes on the evolution of different tectonic scenarios,\n\nkeeping in mind that the \u201cprimary value of models is heuristic\u201d (Oreskes et al., 1994).\n\n\n\n102 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\n7.1 The influence of rifting on escarpment migration1\n\n7.1.1 Abstract\n\nUsing numerical models that couple surface processes, flexural isostasy, faulting and\n\nthe thermal effects of rifting, we show that fault-bounded escarpments created at rift\n\nflanks by mechanical unloading and flexural rebound have little potential to \u201csurvive\u201d as\n\nretreating escarpments if the lower crust under the rift flank is substantially stretched.\n\nIn this configuration, a drainage divide that persists through time appears landward of\n\nthe initial escarpment in a position close to a secondary bulge that is created during\n\nthe rifting event at a distance that depends on the flexural rigidity of the upper crust.\n\nMoreover, the migration of the escarpment to the secondary bulge occurs when the pre-rift\n\ntopography dips landward, otherwise the evolution of the escarpment is guided by the\n\npre-existing inland drainage divide. To illustrate this new mechanism for the evolution\n\nof passive margins, we study the examples of Southeastern Australia and Southeastern\n\nBrazil. We propose that a pre-existing inland drainage divide with rift related flank uplift\n\ncan produce the double drainage divide observed in Southeastern Australia. On the other\n\nhand, we conclude that it is possible that the Serra do Mar escarpments on the Southeastern\n\nBrazilian margin originated as a secondary flexural bulge during rifting that persisted\n\nthrough time. In both cases, the retreating escarpment scenario is unlikely and the present-\n\nday margin morphology can be explained as resulting from rift-related vertical motions\n\nalone, without requiring significant post-rift \u201crejuvenation\u201d.\n\n7.1.2 Introduction\n\nMany rifted margins around the world are flanked by great escarpments, i.e. up to 1500-\n\nm high topographic steps subparallel to the coast that separate high-elevation continental\n\ninterior plateaux from low-elevation coastal regions. These escarpments are observed along\n\nboth young and old rifted margins (e.g. the Red Sea escarpment bordering a 30-25 Ma\n\ncontinental margin; the Serra do Mar escarpment along the 140-130 Ma Southeastern\n\n1This section is part of the submitted article of Sacek, Braun, and van der Beek (2011). The manuscript\n\nof this section was maintained in the active voice, as in the original paper. The numerical model described\n\nin the Chapters 2 to 6 is briefly reintroduced in this section to maintain the logical structure of the original\n\nmanuscript.\n\n\n\nSection 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 103\n\nBrazilian margin; and the Great Escarpment of Southeastern Australia escarpment where\n\nrifting occurred at 100-80 Ma).\n\nMany authors have demonstrated that the evolution and persistence of these escarp-\n\nments through geological time is the result of the combined effect of erosion and the flexural\n\nisostatic response of the lithosphere to stretching and rifting (Braun and Beaumont, 1989;\n\nGilchrist and Summerfield, 1990; Kooi and Beaumont, 1994; Tucker and Slingerland, 1994).\n\nAlthough these mechanisms successfully explain the persistence of escarpments, their post-\n\nrift evolution remains controversial (Braun and van der Beek, 2004), as different initial\n\nconditions for the margin may result in very different denudation histories, while leading\n\nto similar present-day morphologies (Gilchrist et al., 1994; Gallagher and Brown, 1999;\n\nBraun and van der Beek, 2004). Moreover, many geomorphologists remain convinced that\n\nhigh-elevation rifted margins require some form of post-rift reactivation (e.g. Partridge and\n\nMaud, 1987; Ollier and Pain, 1994; Japsen et al., 2006; Burke and Gunnell, 2008). Finally,\n\ntopographic patterns may be complexified by local structural and/or lithological controls\n\n(e.g. van der Beek et al., 2001; Gunnell and Harbor, 2010).\n\nGilchrist et al. (1994), Kooi and Beaumont (1994) and van der Beek et al. (2002) de-\n\nmonstrated the importance of the position of a preexisting drainage divide on the evolution\n\nof the escarpment, highlighting two possible denudation scenarios: the escarpment-retreat\n\nscenario, where the original escarpment is the main drainage divide after rifting and re-\n\nmains the divide during post-breakup escarpment evolution; and the plateau-degradation\n\nscenario, where the initial drainage divide is located landward of the margin. In the\n\nfirst scenario, the escarpment migrates continuously landward as the headwaters of the\n\nseaward-draining rivers cut back into the plateau at the escarpment top, whereas in the\n\nsecond scenario the inland drainage divide remains stationary and the original escarpment,\n\nnear the coast, is eroded away and is progressively replaced by an escarpment pinned at\n\nthe preexisting inland divide.\n\nIn the above models, it was assumed that the existence and location of a preexisting\n\ninland divide are set by external factors; i.e. the initial topography is a relict from previous\n\ntectonic, magmatic or geomorphic events, unrelated to the rifting process. These results\n\nwere based on landscape evolution models that do not take the development of offshore\n\nbasins and the kinematics associated with rifting and breakup into account. Other models\n\n\n\n104 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\n(e.g. Pazzaglia and Gardner, 1994; van Balen et al., 1995) simulated the post-rift evolu-\n\ntion of margins to study the interaction of onshore and offshore processes, considering the\n\nflexural response of the lithosphere to erosion and deposition. On the other hand, qualita-\n\ntive models have been proposed to explain the formation of an inland drainage divide in\n\nresponse to underplating during rifting, resulting in crustal thickening and uplift of the to-\n\npography (e.g Lister et al., 1986; Lister and Etheridge, 1989). More recent thermo-dynamic\n\nmodelling has shown that this style of rifting is feasible (Huismans and Beaumont, 2003).\n\nIn this work we present the results of a new numerical model for the evolution of\n\nrifted margins that combines surface processes, flexural isostasy and the kinematic effects\n\nof both faulting of the upper crust and stretching of the lithosphere. The novelty of our\n\napproach is that it combines the effects of these processes to predict the evolution of the\n\nmargin\u2019s morphology since the onset of extension. We show that even when the initial\n\ndrainage divide is close to the margin, the effect of crustal thinning and the subsequent\n\nthermal subsidence of the margin naturally creates a secondary drainage divide in an\n\ninland position, the location of which essentially depends on the flexural rigidity of the\n\ncrust and lithosphere. Under some circumstances, the system may evolve in such a way\n\nthat the final escarpment position coincides with the secondary divide, similar to the\n\nplateau degradation scenario mentioned above. We apply our model to two case studies\n\non the Southeastern Brazilian and Southeastern Australian margins, to assess how much\n\nof the overall margin topography can be explained by our model, without recourse to post-\n\nrifting tectonic \u201crejuvenation\u201d of the margins or local structural or lithologic control. Our\n\napproach is therefore to explore in how much rifted margin topography can be explained\n\nin a systemic manner and what aspects would require conjectural explanations.\n\n7.1.3 The numerical model\n\nThe processes acting during and after rifting are numerous, complex and often inter-\n\nconnected. They include stretching and faulting in the lithosphere, which will induce a\n\nstrong perturbation to its thermal structure. The rift and the post-rift stages of the margin\n\nevolution are affected by thermal effects, flexure and isostatic compensation that determine\n\nthe amplitude and rate of change of surface subsidence and uplift. Concomitantly, surface\n\nprocesses act to transport mass at the surface of the Earth to create landforms and also\n\n\n\nSection 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 105\n\naffect the isostatic balance of the lithosphere.\n\nThese processes result in a set of competing forces as shown in Figure 6.1. Stretching\n\nof the lithosphere reshapes the surface by faulting and alters the flexural isostatic state of\n\nthe lithosphere due to horizontal movement of density interfaces, creating vertical forces\n\nrelated to faulting of the upper crust (FF ) and thinning of the lower crust during stretching\n\n(FS). Stretching also results in advection of material that perturbs the thermal state of the\n\nlithosphere, which, in turn, changes its density, resulting in vertical forces, which we name\n\nFT . Surface processes also induce vertical forces in the lithosphere (Fsp) by redistribution of\n\nmass associated with erosion, transport and deposition of sediments. The flexural response\n\nof the lithosphere to these loads results in vertical movement of the surface wt, perturbing\n\nthe topography and consequently the evolution of surface processes.\n\nTo quantify the complex interactions between there various processes we have develo-\n\nped a numerical model. In the following lines, we describe each process in detail together\n\nwith its numerical implementation.\n\nFlexure and isostasy\n\nTo simulate the response of the lithosphere to vertical loading, we consider regional\n\nisostatic compensation using the thin elastic plate approximation\n\n(L?)TDL?w + (?m ??in)gw = F (7.1)\n\nwhere w is the vertical displacement of the plate, g is the acceleration of gravity (Table 7.1),\n\n?m is mantle density, ?in is the density of the material infilling the depressions, F is the\n\nvertical load,\n\n(L?) =\n[\n?2\n\n?x2\n,\n?2\n\n?y2\n, 2\n\n?2\n\n?x?y\n\n]T\n\nD = D\n\n?\n????\n\n1 ? 0\n\n? 1 0\n\n0 0 (1 ??)/2\n\n?\n????\n\nD = ET 3e /12[1 ??2] is the flexural rigidity of the plate and depends on Young\u2019s modulus\n\nE, the effective elastic thickness Te and Poisson\u2019s ratio ?.\n\nThe vertical load F is obtained by the summation of the forces related to thermal\n\n\n\n106 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\neffects FT (equation 7.4), surface processes Fsp (equation 7.8) and thinning of the lower\n\ncrust FS (equation 7.5), as described below.\n\nEquation 7.1 is solved numerically using the finite-element method; a complete des-\n\ncription of this implementation is given in Sacek and Ussami (2009). Note that this finite-\n\nelement formulation can include effects arising from spatial variations in flexural rigidity.\n\nThermal model\n\nThe thermal evolution of the lithosphere is obtained by solving the three-dimensional\n\nheat-transfer equation\n\n?c\n\n(\n?T\n\n?t\n+ v \u00b7?T\n\n)\n= ?\u00b7 (k?T) (7.2)\n\nwhere T is temperature, ? is density, c is heat capacity, k is conductivity and v =\n\n(uadv,vadv,wadv) is the advection velocity.\n\nThe advection velocity v describes the velocity of rock particles during stretching of\n\nthe lithosphere. To simulate the upwelling divergent flow associated with the divergence of\n\nconjugate rift margins and stretching of the lower part of the lithosphere near the center\n\nof the rift, we assume that v is the solution to the classical corner-flow problem, which is\n\ngiven by (Fletcher et al., 2009):\n\nuadv = sign(x)\n\n[\n?A2 ?A4\n\n(\narctan\n\nz\n\n|x|\n\n)\n+ (A3|x| + A4z)\n\n(\n?|x|\nx2 + z2\n\n)]\n\nwadv = ?\n[\nA1 + A3\n\n(\narctan\n\nz\n\n|x|\n\n)\n+ (A3|x| + A4z)\n\n(\n?z\n\nx2 + z2\n\n)] (7.3)\n\nwhere, for the geometry and boundary conditions of our problem,\n\nA1 = 0,A2 =\n2?Uz ??2Ux\n\n?2 ? 4\n,A3 =\n\n4Ux ? 2?Uz\n?2 ? 4\n\n,A4 =\n2?Ux ? 4Uz\n?2 ? 4\n\n.\n\nUx is the half-spreading horizontal velocity at the surface and Uz is the axial vertical\n\nvelocity at x = 0, the center of the rift.\n\nEquation 7.2 is solved using the finite element method following the formulation of\n\nBraun (2003). The temperatures of the top and bottom of the thermal model are main-\n\ntained at constant values (Table 7.1).\n\nThe vertical load FT associated with any perturbation of temperature ?T from the\n\n\n\nSection 7.1.

The vertical force FS arising\n\nfrom stretching and thinning of the lower crust is given by:\n\nFS = (?m ??c) g?hcrust (7.5)\n\nwhere ?hcrust is the variation of crustal thickness resulting from the stretching of the lower\n\ncrust and ?c is the density of the crust.\n\nTo simulate movement along faults in the upper crust, we use the flexural cantilever\n\nmodel of Kusznir et al. (1991). Although we adopted the flexural cantilever model to\n\nreproduce the flexural response of the upper crust during the rift, there is no consensus\n\nabout the predominant rheological behavior of the upper crust during rifting. Studying\n\nthe mechanisms responsible for the development of rift flanks in the Baikal rift, SE Siberia,\n\nvan der Beek (1997), for instance, concluded that plastic behavior of the upper crust is\n\nmore important than assumed by the flexural cantilever model. On the other hand, the\n\nflexural cantilever model was successfully used to describe the geometry of grabens and\n\ncrustal block rotation with wavelengths of a few kilometers, as observed in many rifted\n\nregions (e.g Kusznir and Ziegler, 1992; van Wees and Cloetingh, 1994; Nadin and Kusznir,\n\n1995; Kusznir et al., 2004).\n\nWe therefore introduce an effective elastic thickness for the upper crust, Te,uc, which\n\ndoes not necessarily coincide with Te, the elastic thickness of the entire lithosphere. By\n\nusing two different values for Te, we introduce the possibility to reproduce the superposition\n\nof different flexural responses to deformation and/or loading, as observed for example in\n\nthe East African rift system, where van Wees and Cloetingh (1994) obtained a value of\n\n\n\n108 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\nTe = 3 ? 5 km in trying to reproduce basement geometry with a 3-D flexural model\n\nwhilst Ebinger et al. (1991) obtained Te = 21 km in the same area fitting gravity data.\n\nIt is commonly assumed (Burov and Diament, 1995) that low Te values account for the\n\nflexural behavior of the upper crust, whereas high Te values reflect the regional response\n\nof the subcrustal lithosphere. The use of two different flexural rigidities for the same\n\nregion implies that the upper crust is partly decoupled from the subcrustal lithosphere by\n\na ductile lower crust. This condition can be satisfied when the crust is thick and/or has\n\na high geothermal gradient (Burov and Diament, 1995; Brown and Phillips, 2000). From\n\nthe analysis of yield-strength envelopes for different thermal ages and crustal thickness,\n\nBurov and Diament (1995) showed that the lithosphere is practically always decoupled\n\nfor crustal thickness > 35 km, independent of the thermal age of the lithosphere (see\n\nFigure 4b in Burov and Diament, 1995). The two margins studied in this work in Section\n\n5.2 are developed on relatively thick crust. Receiver function analysis for Southeastern\n\nBrazil showed crustal thicknesses between 35 and 43 km close to the coast (Assumpc?a?o\n\net al., 2002). Likewise, Southeastern Australia presents thick crust from receiver function\n\nanalysis, between 34 and 52 km (Clitheroe et al., 2000).\n\nIn the formulation of Kusznir et al. (1991), extension of the upper crust is accom-\n\nmodated by planar faults. Considering an amount of extension Ef of the upper crust\n\naccommodated by a planar fault dipping at an angle ? (Figure 4.5), the vertical displace-\n\nment df of the surface relative to the footwall, in the absence of gravity, is\n\ndf =\n\n??\n? 0 if the point is on the footwall?Ef \u00b7 tan ? if the point is on the hangingwall\n\nTo restore isostatic equilibrium (Figure 4.5c), a buoyancy force FF given by\n\nFF = ??cgdf (7.6)\n\nhas to be added to the isostatic balance. Assuming that the upper crust has finite rigidity\n\nduring faulting, the flexural response wF of the upper crust to the force FF is given by:\n\n(L?)TDucL?wF + ?cgwF = FF (7.7)\n\nwhere Duc is the flexural rigidity of the upper crust, i.e. dependent of Te,uc. The final\n\nconfiguration is shown in Figure 4.5d.\n\n\n\nSection 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 109\n\nSurface processes\n\nSurface processes are taken into account following the methodology of Braun and Sam-\n\nbridge (1997). The main advantage of this approach, based on an irregular discretization\n\nof surface topography, is that it is possible to accurately simulate the relative horizontal\n\nmovement of crustal blocks at finite rates, i.e. without the loss of short-wavelength features\n\nthat is inherent to other approaches based on interpolation of the topography.\n\nOnshore processes are divided into fluvial and hillslope processes. Fluvial processes of\n\nerosion, transport and sedimentation are modeled following the formulation of Beaumont\n\net al. (1992) where local variations in topography h are described through a first-order\n\nreaction equation:\n\n?h\n\n?t\n= ?\n\nq\neqb\nf ? qf\nLf\n\nwhere q\neqb\nf is the maximum sediment transport capacity, qf is the sediment flux per unit\n\nwidth [L2T?1] and Lf is a parameter with dimension of [L]. q\neqb\nf in a channel takes the\n\nfollowing form:\n\nq\neqb\nf = kfqr|?h|\n\nwhere kf is the erosional coefficient due to the fluvial process, qr is water discharge and\n\n|?h| is the modulus of topographic gradient. The water discharge is calculated by spatially\n\nintegrating net precipitation rate vR, which is assumed uniform in space and time for\n\nsimplicity. There are different expressions for q\neqb\nf in the literature, where the exponents\n\nof qr and |?h| are not equal to one (see Braun, 2006). We assume that these variations\n\nin the value of the exponents of qr and |?h| are of secondary importance for the present\n\nwork, since the general drainage pattern and the position of the drainage divides will not\n\nbe significantly modified by varying the exponents (see Figure 9 in Tucker and Whipple,\n\n2002).\n\nHillslope processes are modeled through a linear diffusion equation, assuming that\n\ntransport is linearly proportional to slope (see Dietrich et al., 2003, and references therein):\n\n?h\n\n?t\n= ?\u00b7 (kd?h)\n\nwhere kd is the coefficient of diffusive transport. van der Beek and Braun (1998) showed\n\nthat there is no theoretical basis for including hillslope diffusion in large spatial-scale\n\nmodels. In effect the dominant process in the onshore domain in our numerical simulations\n\n\n\n110 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\nis fluvial transport and the evolution of the landscape is not significantly modified if we do\n\nnot include hillslope diffusion. On the other hand, the incorporation of hillslope diffusion\n\ncan improve the stability of the surface-process simulation for different time steps and grid\n\nsize, by avoiding exceedingly steep links between grid cells.\n\nFor the offshore transport of sediments we used the methodology of van Balen et al.\n\n(1995), based on the same principle as for diffusion processes on land, but with a non-linear\n\ndiffusion coefficient, km:\n?h\n\n?t\n= ?\u00b7 (km?h)\n\nIn this simple model, the diffusivity km decreases exponentially with water depth, simula-\n\nting the decrease in energy available for sediment transport with increasing water depth:\n\nkm = k\n?\nm exp\n\n(\nh?hs.l.\nh0\n\n)\nk?m is a constant [L\n\n2T?1], hs.l. is sea level and h0 is a characteristic length (Table 7.1).\n\nTo compute the vertical load Fsp resulting from a variation in topography ?h associated\n\nwith surface processes we assume that sediment density, ?s, is equal to crustal rock density,\n\nfor the sake of simplicity. With this approximation, we obtain the following relationship:\n\nFsp =\n\n????????\n???????\n\n??cg?h + ?wg?h if h + ?h &lt;hs.l. and h &lt;hs.l.\n??cg?h + ?wg (hs.l. ?h) if h + ?h > hs.l. and h &lt;hs.l.\n??cg?h + ?wg (h + ?h?hs.l.) if h + ?h &lt;hs.l. and h > hs.l.\n??cg?h if h + ?h > hs.l. and h > hs.l.\n\n(7.8)\n\nwhere ?w is water density.\n\nSurface topography is updated by adding the total vertical displacement wt of the\n\nsurface to the initial topography. This displacement is the sum of the components related\n\nto faulting df and the flexural response of the upper crust and lithosphere, respectively\n\nwF and w:\n\nwt = w + wF + df.\n\nNote that ?h is the variation of topography related only to the surface processes of\n\nerosion (?h &lt;0) and deposition (?h > 0). Therefore ?h is independent of the flexural\n\nresponse of the lithosphere. On the other hand, the variation in topography ?h induces\n\nvertical loads Fsp, which are regionally compensated by the lithosphere resulting in a\n\nvertical displacement w of the surface.\n\n\n\nSection 7.1.

The number\n\nof faults (five in our model) is of little importance; they are meant to represent distribu-\n\nted brittle deformation. The faults are activated progressively from I to V, simulating a\n\nwidening of the rift zone in the early stages of development of the rift; they all dip at\n\nan angle equal to ? = 45? and the extension per fault is Ef = 4 km, resulting in a fault\n\nheave |df| = Ef \u00b7 tan ? = 4 km. The especific value of ? and Ef is not very important and\n\ndifferent combinations of ? and Ef can result in the same fault heave |df|, which is the\n\nparameter that principally controls the flexural response of the upper crust during faulting\n\nin the flexural cantilever model (see equation 7.6). In the lower part of the model, we\n\nimpose the velocity field described in equation 7.3, to accommodate the relative movement\n\nof the lithosphere at a velocity Ux relative to the axis of the upwelling-divergent flow.\n\nThe initial dimensions of the model are 200 km (width) \u00d7 600 km (length), and the\n\nmean distance between the nodes in the surface-processes model is 5 km.\n\nPrevious works that did not take into account the influence of rifting on the evolution of\n\nthe landscape (e.g Kooi and Beaumont, 1994) concluded that an initial coastal escarpment\n\nadjoining a horizontal or landward-dipping plateau evolves as a retreating escarpment.\n\nTo assess if this conclusion is valid when stretching and thinning of the lithosphere is\n\nconsidered during the simulation, we use an initial topography that is similar to that used\n\n\n\n112 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\nin other modeling studies of passive margin escarpments, and that consists of a gently\n\nlandward dipping surface described here by the following expression:\n\nh(t = 0) = 500.0 \u00d7 cos\n(\n\n?x\n\n8.0 \u00d7 105\n\n)\n+ 1500.0 (7.9)\n\nwhere x is in meters. In short, the topography decreases monotonically from 2500 m on\n\nthe left-hand side of the model to just below 1150 m on the right-hand side, over a distance\n\nof 600 km.\n\nThe values of the model parameters are given in Table 7.1. They correspond to com-\n\nmonly accepted values for most parameters. We will vary the value of four model parame-\n\nters; the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere Te and of the upper crust Te,uc, the\n\nerosional parameter kf , and the initial position Ludf of the axis of the upwelling-divergent\n\nflow relative to the position of fault V (Figure 7.1). Note that the distance Ludf also defines\n\nthe position of the region of significant crustal thinning. Thus, moving the initial position\n\nof the axis of the upwelling-divergent flow will in fact control the offset between the final\n\nposition of the zone of lower crustal thinning and the position of the faults. We also assume\n\nthat the region where x &lt;Ludf , which, over the duration of the model, evolves to become\n\nsignificantly stretched, is characterized by a low effective elastic thickness (Te = Te,uc),\n\nsimulating a decrease in rigidity due to rifting. All other parameters have constant values\n\nin all model runs, which are shown in Table 7.1.\n\n7.1.5 Results\n\nWe first present the results of a model experiment in which the initial position of the\n\nupwelling flow is close to the faults (Ludf = ?15 km), resulting in thinning of the lower\n\ncrust just under the faulted region. The solution is shown in Figures 7.2 and 7.3 as a set\n\nof snap shots at 12 time intervals in the evolution of the model. The other parameters of\n\nModel 1 are shown in Table 7.2.\n\nDuring the first 1 Myr of the simulation (Figure 7.2), the faults I-V are progressively\n\nactivated and the lithosphere experiences a total extension of 20 km. After this, the faults\n\nare locked, but the lithosphere on the left-hand side of the model continues its movement\n\nrelative to the axis of the upwelling-divergent flow and, consequently, the lower crust is\n\nthinned as a consequence of stretching. In this simulation, we assume that continued\n\n\n\nSection 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 113\n\nParameters Description Value\n\nSurface\n\nprocesses\n\nhs.l.

This subsidence separates the escarpment from a secondary drainage\n\ndivide that has formed landward of the initial escarpment (red arrows in Figure 7.2). This\n\nevolution of the topography is a result of the flexural response to normal faulting and\n\ncorresponds to the development of a secondary depression and bulge landward of the rift\n\naxis. The position of this secondary bulge relative to the escarpment depends on the\n\neffective elastic thickness of the crust.

The light and\n\ndark gray regions on the side of the model represent the lower and upper crust, respectively. The yellow\n\nregions on the side of the model represent sediments. The blue curves represent the shoreline. The black\n\ndots mark the position of fault V. The green lines mark the zones of mean relief > 300 m (see Figure 7.6).\n\n\n\nSection 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 117\n\nThe analytical solution also gives the difference in elevation h2 (Figure 7.4a) between the\n\nsecondary bulge and the adjacent secondary depression; its value is ?7% of wmax, the\n\nmaximum elevation of the primary rift flank. Thus the secondary depression and adjacent\n\nbulge are a logical consequence of the flexural response to rift faulting. Its amplitude\n\nis small because of the exponential decrease of the amplitude of the deflection but the\n\ndifference in height between the secondary high and low is certainly not negligible. Note\n\nthat the formation of an inland drainage divide occurs when the initial topography is\n\nsloping landward or is flat. If the initial topography slopes seaward from a preexisting\n\ninland drainage divide, the formation of the depression during faulting will not contribute\n\nto the formation of a new inland drainage divide.\n\nFor the value of upper-crustal elastic thickness that we have chosen (Te,uc = 5 km),\n\nthe position of the secondary drainage divide should, theoretically, be at x2 ? 111 km.\n\nHowever, this analytical solution assumes that the preexisting topography is horizontal.\n\nFor a sloping initial topography, the position of the secondary drainage divide can move by\n\nseveral tens of kilometers, depending on the assumed initial slope. In our example, with\n\nthe geometric distribution of the faults as shown in Figure 7.1 and the initial topography\n\ndescribed by equation 7.9, the analytical position of the second drainage divide is x?2 ? 85\n\nkm.\n\nWith continued stretching and thinning of the lower crust, the region seaward of the\n\nsecondary bulge subsides. Through the combined effect of erosion and thermal subsidence,\n\nthe initial escarpment adjacent to the faults rapidly vanishes (i.e., within 20 Myr after\n\nrifting) and the main topographic relief that persists through time is the drainage divide\n\ncreated landward by the formation of the secondary bulge (Figure 7.3). Further in the\n\ndevelopment of the model run, the region that was occupied by the initial escarpment con-\n\ntinues to be eroded and progressively subsides, finally crossing the base level and becoming\n\ninundated near the end of the model run.\n\nThese processes are summarized in Figure 7.4b. Because of its high relief, the coastal\n\nescarpment is rapidly eroded. Incision of the adjacent axial river, located between the\n\ncoastal escarpment and the secondary bulge, tends to isolate the coastal escarpment. Mo-\n\nreover, thinning of the lower crust and cooling of the lithosphere result in subsidence of the\n\nmargin (vertical arrows in Figure 7.4b), but with decreasing amplitude landwards.

(b) Mechanisms\n\nthat reshape the margin after faulting. Open arrows indicate direction of drainage and the size of the\n\narrows illustrate the magnitude of erosion. The black dot represents an axial river, parallel to the fault,\n\nbetween the coastal escarpment and the secondary bulge. Gray arrows represent the differential subsidence\n\n(decreasing landward) due to thinning of the lower crust and thermal cooling of the lithosphere.\n\ncombination of rapid erosion of the coastal escarpment and differential subsidence of the\n\nmargin favors the emergence of the secondary bulge and its establishment as the main,\n\n\u201cpermanent\u201d drainage-divide escarpment, while the coastal escarpment progressively di-\n\nsappears. Note that a necessary condition for the formation of the secondary divide is that\n\nthere is preexisting topography and rifting thus leads to a base-level drop. If the preexis-\n\nting elevation was at sea level, just the initial fault-controlled escarpment will be eroded.\n\nTherefore, the persistence of escarpments requires a preexisting high-standing topography,\n\nin accord with previous findings (Tucker and Slingerland, 1994; Kooi and Beaumont, 1994).\n\nIf we displace the initial position of the axis of the upwelling flow far from the zone\n\nof imposed faulting at Ludf = ?115 km (100 km seaward relative to the first model), the\n\nevolution of the margin is dramatically different (Figure 7.5, Model 2). In this situation,\n\n\n\nSection 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 119\n\nthinning is almost insignificant under the faulted region and, consequently, the ensuing\n\nthermal subsidence of the lithosphere in this zone is negligible. As a result, the initial\n\nescarpment created close to fault V remains the main drainage divide throughout the\n\nnumerical experiment. This result clearly demonstrates that, together with the slope of the\n\npre-rift topography dipping toward the interior of the continent, the combination of uplift\n\nof the secondary bulge and differential thermal subsidence is responsible for the migration\n\nof the main drainage divide towards the secondary bulge in the previous experiment.\n\nIf we consider the evolution of Model 2 in more detail, we notice that the high to-\n\npography related to the intermediate faults II-IV is progressively eroded away and the\n\nmorphological signature of the half-graben structures disappears. Most of the sedimenta-\n\ntion occurs just seaward of fault I, because it is only in this region of the model that the\n\nlower crust has been sufficiently stretched to produce subsidence and the ensuing accom-\n\nmodation space.\n\nTo compare the evolution of relief in both model experiments, we divided the margin\n\nin strips of 5 km, parallel to the rift axis, and calculated the mean topographic relief in\n\neach of these. Relief is defined here as the maximum elevation difference between adjacent\n\nnodes. Results are shown in Figures 7.3 and 7.5, where green lines correspond to strips\n\nwhere mean relief is > 300 m for the first model experiment (Figure 7.3) and red lines for\n\nthe second model experiment (Figure 7.5). The regions of high relief are plotted together in\n\nFigure 7.6, which also shows the analytical position of the secondary bulge x?2 for Te,uc = 5\n\nkm. This figure summarizes the relief evolution of both models. We observe that in Model\n\n1 (Ludf = ?15 km, green lines) the high relief of the primary rift flank rapidly vanishes\n\nand another region of high relief (a new escarpment) appears close to the secondary bulge\n\nat x?2, and progressively retreats toward the interior of the continent. It is interesting to\n\nobserve that the region between the primary and secondary escarpments does not present\n\nsubstantial relief during the evolution of the margin. The coastal escarpment has not\n\nmigrated continuously landward, but has reappeared in its new position. For Model 2,\n\nwith little thinning of the lower crust below the initial escarpment (Ludf = ?115 km,\n\nred lines in Figure 7.6) the rift shoulder remains the main escarpment during the entire\n\nsimulation and significantly less escarpment migration takes place than in the previous\n\nmodel.\n\n\n\n120 Chapter 7.

The black dashed line indicates the position x?2 of the secondary bulge\n\ncalculated analytically.\n\nTo demonstrate further that the position of the secondary, inland escarpment is con-\n\ntrolled by that of the secondary flexural bulge, we have run a series of experiments in which\n\nthe erosion rate was artificially reduced (by decreasing kfvR to 0.001 m/year). In this way,\n\nthe positions of the various drainage divides are less perturbed by erosion. In Figure 7.7 we\n\npresent different simulations with reduced erosion. A similar pattern of escarpment evolu-\n\ntion is nonetheless observed, as shown in the relief-evolution diagrams. In every diagram\n\nof Figure 7.7 the model experiments with Ludf = ?15 km (green lines) are characterized\n\nby a secondary escarpment originating very close to the secondary flexural bulge at x?2,\n\nwhile in the model experiments with Ludf = ?115 km (red lines) the escarpment remains\n\nclose to the rift-bounding fault.\n\nThe effective elastic thickness of the upper crust Te,uc clearly controls the initial position\n\nof the new escarpment at the secondary bulge, which is, on the other hand, relatively\n\ninsensitive to the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere Te.

In the model runs with Te,uc = 5 km (Figure 7.7a and b), the intermediate\n\nmodel also generates an inland escarpment, but it develops at a later time relative to the\n\nmodel runs with Ludf = ?15 km. Moreover, in this intermediate model run, high relief\n\nclose to the fault is preserved for a longer time than for the model runs with Ludf = ?15\n\nkm. On the other hand, the intermediate models with Te,uc = 10 km (Figure 7.7c and d)\n\ndo not generate an inland escarpment. This is because the primary flank uplift, next to\n\nthe faults, is broader due to the higher rigidity of the upper crust, and therefore erodes\n\nless efficiently and survives for a longer time as the main drainage divide.\n\n7.1.6 Discussion\n\n7.1.6.1 Condition for migration of the drainage divide\n\nAs highlighted in the previous section, the primary condition for long-term preservation\n\nof an escarpment is the pre-existence of topography. This condition is necessary both in\n\nthe retreating escarpment scenario and in the pinned divide one. Taking into account this\n\ncondition, the present model provides a new mechanism for the development of an inland\n\nescarpment that retreats only slowly.\n\nThe migration of the escarpment from the flank uplift to the inland position depends\n\non the amount of thinning of the crust during lithospheric stretching. In Figure 7.8 we\n\npresent crustal stretching factor profiles for the models with Ludf = ?15, -65 and -115 km.\n\nIn the numerical models, the formation of the inland escarpment occurred for Ludf = ?15\n\nand -65 km (see Figure 7.7), which are related to maximum ?crust values of 1.58 and 1.19\n\nnear the flank uplift, respectively (Figure 7.8). Therefore, migration of the escarpment can\n\nbe produced even for small values of ?crust and is also promoted by low crustal rigidity\n\n(Figure 7.7). Note that although the effect seems to be controlled by the magnitude\n\nof crustal stretching near the fault, it is in fact the lateral variation in the lower crustal\n\nthinning parameter, with ?crust decreasing landwards and producing differential subsidence\n\nof the margin, that plays the fundamental role in producing lateral displacement of the\n\n\n\n124 Chapter 7.

The coastal escarpment separates the low lying coastal strip\n\nfrom a 600-m high plateau and forms a local drainage divide. The main drainage divide\n\nof the Southeastern Highlands is located 50-100 km landward of the coastal escarpment\n\n(Figure 7.9c). Between the escarpment and the inland drainage divide, several rivers flow\n\nsubparallel to the escarpment (e.g. van der Beek and Braun, 1998, 1999). van der Beek and\n\nBraun (1999) proposed that this morphology is best explained by the existence of an inland\n\ndrainage divide predating the rifting episode, which took place 90-100 Ma, at the present-\n\nday location of the drainage divide and that the escarpment did not evolve by retreat from\n\nthe coast to its present-day position, but formed in-place by erosion of the coastal areas\n\n\n\nSection 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 125\n\nsoon after rifting. These conclusions are consistent with low-temperature thermochrono-\n\nlogy data (Moore et al., 1986; Dumitru et al., 1991; O\u2019Sullivan et al., 1996; Persano et al.,\n\n2002), although, due to the relatively small amounts of exhumation experienced along the\n\nescarpment, the interpretation of this data remains somewhat equivocal (Braun and van\n\nder Beek, 2004). A large body of geomorphologic work has consistently shown that de-\n\nnudation rates are low and drainage networks of the Southeastern Highlands have been\n\nstable throughout the Cenozoic, excluding significant post-breakup tectonic modification\n\nof the margin (cf. Bishop and Goldrick, 2000, for a review).\n\nThere are two ways in which the modeling work presented here could explain the\n\npresent-day topography of southeastern Australia. The first, most obvious interpretation\n\nis to consider that the present-day escarpment formed as the primary rift flank during\n\nrifting and that the inland drainage divide formed as the secondary bulge, later amplified\n\nby erosion of the coastal areas and the regions between the two divides, where the rivers\n\nrun parallel to the escarpment.\n\nAs shown in the models with Ludf = ?65 km in Figure 7.7a and b, the inland and\n\nthe coastal regions of high relief can coexist for a long time (> 100 Myr), with the main\n\nrivers between them running parallel to the escarpment, producing a morphology that\n\nresembles the eastern highlands in Australia. Moreover, the distance between the coastal\n\nescarpment and the inland drainage divide of southeastern Australia is of the same order\n\nas the distance between the initial escarpment and the secondary bulge in the numerical\n\nmodels.\n\nTo better illustrate this point, we ran another model experiment (Figure 7.9a, Model\n\n3) for which we used low effective elastic thickness values for the lithosphere (Te = 10\n\nkm), which is likely to be applicable for the southeastern Australian margin, as discussed\n\nin Braun and van der Beek (2004). After 90 Myr, the numerical model results present\n\nan inland drainage divide that has formed at the location of the secondary bulge, and an\n\ninitial escarpment that has persisted near the coast, similar to the southeastern Australia\n\nescarpment.\n\nHowever, this scenario is inconsistent with the observations on two points: first, the\n\npresent-day escarpment is clearly erosional rather than tectonic in origin (e.g. Bishop and\n\nGoldrick (2000) and references therein), but in our numerical model the escarpment is\n\n\n\n126 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\nFigure 7.9: Comparison between the numerical model and the southeastern Australia margin (a) Model\n\n3: Numerical simulation with initial topography dipping landward. See Table 7.2 for parameter values\n\nused in this experiment; (b) Model 4: Numerical simulation with an initial inland drainage divide; (c)\n\nDigital elevation model of southeastern Australia, showing the coastal escarpment and the inland drainage\n\ndivide, indicated by the arrows.\n\n\n\nSection 7.1. The influence of rifting on escarpment migration 127\n\nassociated with the rift flank adjacent to the main basin-bounding fault and has retreated\n\nonly a short distance. Second, the main drainage divide appears to be an old feature that\n\nhas been in place at least since the onset of rifting. The SE Australian drainage divide is\n\nassociated with a strongly negative Bouguer anomaly (Young, 1989), implying a thick crust\n\nunder this region that isostatically sustains the high topography. Although the timing of\n\ncrustal thickening is not known, it is possibly related to Paleozoic active-margin tectonics\n\n(Lambeck and Stephenson, 1986; van der Beek et al., 1999) or crustal thickening due to\n\nunderplating during rifting (Lister et al., 1986).\n\nThe second, more likely interpretation is to follow the suggestion made by van der\n\nBeek and Braun (1999), who consider the main inland divide to be a pre-existing feature.\n\nWe thus propose that a pre-existing inland drainage divide combined with rift-related\n\nflank uplift can produce the double drainage divide observed in Southeastern Australia.\n\nFurthermore, the peripheral subsidence created during rift-flank uplift (Figure 7.4) can\n\nenhance the double drainage divide pattern, separating the inland drainage divide and the\n\nrift flank. To illustrate this idea, we designed a new model that considers an initial inland\n\ndivide; the evolution of this model is shown in Figure 7.9b. In this model, after the faulting\n\nstage, the rift flank retreats ? 60 km landward, approaching the inland divide. Note that\n\nin this case the permanence of the landward-retreating rift flank through time results from\n\nthe low stretching factor of the crust under the rift flank during and after rifting. While\n\nthe rift flank retreats landward, the inland divide remains at roughly the same position\n\nthrough time. The uplift of the rift flank and the peripheral subsidence locally changes\n\nthe drainage pattern and promotes rivers flowing parallel to the inland divide and the\n\nretreating rift flank in the region between the two (Figure 7.9b, at 90 Myr). The model of\n\nFigure 7.9b combines two models studied by van der Beek and Braun (1999): the flank-\n\nuplift and the inclined-plateau model. In their work, they analyzed separately the effect of\n\nrift-flank uplift and a pre-existing seaward-sloping plateau on landscape evolution. They\n\nconcluded that only the inclined plateau model can produce the double drainage divide\n\nconfiguration as observed in Southeastern Australia, but only for very small values of the\n\ndip of the plateau (&lt;0.1%). Combining both models it is possible to explain the double\n\ndrainage divide pattern in Southeastern Australia without requiring a very specific initial\n\ntopographic configuration.\n\n\n\n128 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\nIt is important to note that in the model of Figure 7.9a, the formation of the post-rift\n\ninland divide at the secondary bulge occurs because the pre-rift topography dips landward.\n\nWe observed that in the case of pre-existing inland divide (Figure 7.9b, Model 4) with the\n\ntopography dipping seaward, the secondary bulge does not evolve to a new drainage divide\n\nbut is gradually eroded.\n\n7.1.6.4 Serra do Mar, Southeastern Brazil\n\nThe Serra do Mar consists of a set of escarpments that run parallel to the coast of\n\nsoutheastern Brazil for nearly 1000 km and locally reach up to 2 km elevation (Mohriak\n\net al., 2008). Located offshore of the Serra do Mar, the Santos and Campos basins are pre-\n\ndominantly developed on thinned continental crust. An important feature of the basement\n\nunder the Santos and Campos basins is the Cretaceous hinge zone (Figure 7.10b-c) that\n\nmarks a strong variation in basement dip and represents the western limit of Cretaceous\n\nsedimentation in the offshore basins (Karner, 2000). Furthermore, this hinge zone appears\n\nto coincide with the western limit of significant crustal thinning (Karner, 2000). Mohriak\n\net al. (2008) proposed that the present-day Serra do Mar is the result of the retreat of\n\nan escarpment that formed initially at the Cretaceous hinge zone, resulting in a retreat\n\ndistance of 172-247 km.\n\nAccording to the predictions of our models, the thinning of the crust under the offshore\n\nportion of southeastern Brazil makes retreat of the present-day escarpment from its original\n\nposition at the hinge line quite unlikely. It appears much more plausible that the present-\n\nday main drainage divide was created as a secondary flexural bulge that persisted through\n\ntime (see Figure 7.3). These results agree with the conclusions of Hiruma et al. (2010), who\n\nsuggest that the Bocaina Plateau, the highest part of the Serra do Mar, corresponds to a\n\npreserved inland drainage divide. The distance between the escarpment and the initial rift\n\nshoulder in the numerical model of Figure 7.3 is nearly 170 km, of the same order as the\n\ndistance from the present-day Serra do Mar to the Cretaceous hinge zone (Figure 7.10c).\n\nFurthermore, the final configuration of the basement predicted by our model beneath\n\nthe original rift shoulder is similar to that of the hinge zone in the offshore region of the\n\nSantos basin. In Figure 7.10a we show the stratigraphic pattern predicted by our numerical\n\nmodel (Figure 7.3). In this model the rift shoulder is eroded and subsides due to post-rift\n\n\n\nSection 7.1.

The subsidence\n\nof the coastal area creates accommodation space filled by sediments at a later time. After\n\n50 Myr of evolution in our model (the green line in Figure 7.10a) the region landward\n\nof the hinge line subsides and preserves a substantial sedimentary package, similar to the\n\npost-Cretaceous sedimentation in the Santos basin (Figure 7.10b).\n\nThe load of the margin also favors the migration of the drainage divide to the secondary\n\nbulge, since it imposes a seaward tilt, similar to the differential subsidence due to thinning\n\nof the lower crust.\n\nDuring the Cenozoic, the Southeastern Brazilian margin was affected by renewed conti-\n\nnental rifting (Riccomini et al., 2004) that produced a series of basins parallel to the coast.\n\nRifting also resulted in the isolation of the Serra do Mar escarpments and the formation\n\nof the inland escarpment of the Serra da Mantiqueira (Figure 7.10c).\n\nTo verify the potential effect of late continental rifting on the evolution of the escarp-\n\nment system, we developed a new simulation (Model 5) presented in Figure 7.11 (see Table\n\n7.2). Like in Model 1, stretching of the lithosphere and thinning of the lower crust under\n\nthe rift flank result in the development of an inland drainage divide on the secondary bulge\n\nthat evolves into the new escarpment, while the rift flank escarpment disappears due to\n\nthe combined effects of erosion and subsidence (Figure 7.11a).\n\nAt 70 Myr, we introduce the gradual formation of a 40-km-wide graben, in a position\n\nlandward of the escarpment as indicated in Figure 7.11b. The development of the graben\n\noccurs during 1 Myr, and the rate of uplift close to the flanks of the faults is ?wmax/?t =\n\n1 km/Myr. These faults isolate the oceanward escarpment and create a new one in a\n\nlandward position (Figure 7.11c).\n\nAfter formation of the graben, the erosion and flexural response of the lithosphere con-\n\ntinue to modify the landscape. 50 Myr after the graben formation (Figure 7.11d), both\n\nescarpments persist as prominent topographic features with more than 1500 m relief, repre-\n\nsenting local drainage divides and resembling the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira\n\nescarpments.\n\nThis result shows that Cenozoic rifting does not affect the conclusions of the present\n\nwork about the evolution of the Serra do Mar. The physical explanation for the persistence\n\nof the Serra do Mar after the Cenozoic rifting is that this tectonism did not result in\n\n\n\nSection 7.1.

This work confirms\n\nearlier suggestions that long-term preservation of an escarpment requires a high pre-existing\n\nplateau to have been present. Our model shows how the combination of flexural response\n\nof the crust to faulting during rifting and differential subsidence of the margin can produce\n\nan inland drainage divide that persists through time since the onset of rifting and does not\n\nevolve from the rift shoulder as a retreating escarpment.\n\nWe have observed that the formation of an inland drainage divide is directly controlled\n\nby the thinning pattern of the crust during rifting. The position of the drainage divide\n\ndeveloped on the secondary bulge is controlled by the rigidity of the crust during rifting,\n\nwhile the rigidity of the entire lithosphere plays a secondary role, controlling the retreat\n\nrate of the new escarpment.\n\nThese concepts can potentially clarify the understanding of the formation of the double\n\ndrainage divide pattern observed in Southeastern Australia and can explain the present-\n\nday position of the Serra do Mar escarpment in Brazil relative to the Cretaceous hinge\n\nzone in the offshore basins. They provide, in both cases, a systemic explanation for the\n\nparticular topographic patterns observed, without requiring recourse to conjectural post-\n\nrift reactivation of the margins.\n\nThe ideas proposed here can be further tested by studying in greater details the distri-\n\nbution of extension (? maps) in passive margins and how it relates to escarpment geometry\n\nand position. They can also be confronted with thermochronological data, which provide\n\nconstraints on the timing of erosion in the coastal regions. However, as demonstrated by\n\nBraun and van der Beek (2004), this approach might be hindered by the relatively low\n\namounts of exhumation experienced by many passive margins.\n\n\n\nSection 7.2. Post-rift influence of a thermal plume on passive margins 133\n\n7.2 Post-rift influence of a thermal plume on passive margins2\n\n7.2.1 Abstract\n\nThis work presents how the passage of a thermal anomaly under the lithosphere can\n\naffect the sedimentary evolution of passive margins. We assumed that the uplift related to\n\nthe thermal anomaly is due to the thermal expansion of the lithosphere, and other effects\n\nassociated with the dynamics of the asthenosphere are neglected. We studied different\n\nscenarios in the numerical models, taking into account the interaction of the thermal\n\nevolution of the lithosphere, the flexural isostasy and the surface processes of erosion and\n\ndeposition. The numerical results show that the velocity of the lithosphere relative to\n\nthe thermal anomaly and the flexural rigidity of the continental and oceanic lithospheres\n\nsignificantly affect the evolution of the sedimentary shelf. Finally, the concepts from the\n\nnumerical models are used to study the influence of a thermal anomaly (the Trindade\n\nPlume?) on the evolution of the Campos and Esp??rito Santo Basins, in Southeastern\n\nBrazil.\n\n7.2.2 Introduction\n\nIt is known that many oceanic volcanoes show shallower-than-normal bathymetry that\n\nextends for several hundred kilometers beyond the region of volcanism, whereas very old\n\noceanic volcanoes are not associated with swells (Ito and van Keken, 2007). Therefore, a\n\ntransient mechanism is responsible to produce these swells.\n\nDuring the last decades, different models have been proposed to explain the formation\n\nof these swells. One explanation is that the introduction of buoyant asthenosphere at the\n\nbase of the lithospheric plate produces these swells (Sleep, 1987). Other models describe\n\nthe swell as a dynamic topography due to the upwelling movement of material in the\n\nsub-lithospheric mantle (Ribe and Christensen, 1994). Also, simple isostatic models based\n\non thermal diffusion explains the evolving bathymetry along seamount chains (Ito and\n\nClift, 1998). In fact, these different mechanisms may be acting concomitantly, each one\n\ncontributing partially to the total uplift.\n\nIn the present work, we simulate the uplift of the lithosphere as a result of the thermal\n\n2Since this section is part of an article to be submitted, this section was written in the active voice.\n\n\n\n134 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\nheating of the lithosphere due to the passage of a plume head, exemplified here as a thermal\n\nanomaly at the base of the lithosphere. The uplift produced by the thermal anomaly is\n\nonly due to the diffusional heating and thermal expansion of the lithosphere, and does not\n\ntake into account other effects like dynamic topography created by the upwelling movement\n\nof the plume. Certainly, the dynamic topography associated with the plume must amplify\n\nthe uplift of the surface and, therefore, the uplift predicted in the present work must be\n\ntaken as an underestimated uplift.\n\nIncorporating surface processes of erosion and deposition and regional isostatic com-\n\npensation in the numerical models, we discuss how the transient uplift of the lithosphere\n\ninfluences the evolution of passive margins. In spite of the assumption of the thermal\n\nexpansion of the lithosphere as the mechanism for the formation of swells, the conclusions\n\nabout the evolution of the passive margins are independent of the transient mechanism to\n\ncreate the swells.\n\n7.2.3 The isostatic effect of a moving plume\n\nThe model to study the isostatic effect of a plume moving relatively to the lithosphere\n\nwith velocity ?vrel under the lithosphere is illustrated in Figure 7.12. The model is\n\nconstructed considering that the reference frame is fixed relative to the plume and the\n\nlithosphere is steadily moving over the plume with velocity vrel = (vrel, 0).\n\nhorizontal movement\nof the lithosphere\n\nrelative to the\nplume\n\nthermal anomaly\nat the base of the\n\nlithosphere\n\nlithosphere}\n\nFigure 7.12: Illustration of the numerical model to study the isostatic effect of a thermal plume hitting\n\nthe base of the lithosphere.\n\n\n\nSection 7.2. Post-rift influence of a thermal plume on passive margins 135\n\nThe temperature at the top surface of the model is maintained fixed at Tz=0 = 0\n?C and\n\nthe bottom surface, i.e. the base of the lithosphere, at\n\nTz=?aL = [1300 + Tanomaly exp\n(\n?r2/r20\n\n)\n]?C\n\nwhere Tanomaly is the maximum temperature at the center of the thermal anomaly at the\n\nbase of the lithosphere, r is the horizontal distance to the center of the plume and r0\n\nis a parameter that controls the radius of the thermal anomaly. This problem is solved\n\nnumerically through the finite element method as described in Chapter 3.\n\nThe temperature Tanomaly is based on estimates of excess mantle temperature associ-\n\nated with plumes (e.g. White et al., 1995; Herzberg and O\u2019Hara, 2002) ranging between\n\n100-300?C. In the present work it is assumed that Tanomaly = 175\n?C. The radius r0 is esti-\n\nmated from the width of the swells associated with oceanic volcanoes. Ito and van Keken\n\n(2007) showed that the width of the swells range from hundreds to thousands kilometers\n\n(e.g. Gala?pagos - 300 km; Trindade-Martin Vaz - 1330 km; Azores - 2300 km). In the\n\npresent work r0 is assumed to be equal to r0 = 300 km, resulting in a width of 600 km.\n\nAssuming local isostatic compensation and vertical loading due to thermal expan-\n\nsion of the lithosphere related to temperature variation ?T, the vertical uplift wT of\n\nthe lithosphere is\n\n?mgwT =\n\n? 0\n?aL\n\n?m?T ?Tgdz\n\nwT =\n\n? 0\n?aL\n\n?T ?Tdz.\n\nThe uplift of the lithosphere wT due to the passage of a thermal anomaly depends on\n\nthe relative velocity vrel. If the relative velocity is too high, there is not enough time to\n\nheat the lithosphere and the thermal expansion is not expressive. Therefore, the maximum\n\nuplift of the lithosphere decreases with the increase of vrel. To illustrate this effect, in the\n\nFigure 7.13 we present maps of the thermal uplift of the lithosphere due to a thermal\n\nanomaly at the base of the plate, for different relative velocities (vrel = 0, 1, 2 and 3\n\ncm/yr). In these numerical models, the maximum uplift varies from 401 m for vrel = 0 to\n\n122 m for vrel = 3 m/yr (see Table 7.4). It is possible to observe that the amplitude and\n\nshape of the uplift depends on the thickness of the lithosphere, the relative velocity vrel\n\nand the magnitude and extent of the thermal anomaly.\n\n\n\n136 Chapter 7.

The rate of uplift maps also show that the\n\nregions close to the thermal anomaly initially undergoes uplift, followed by a protracted\n\nsubsidence.\n\nAnother aspect observed in Figure 7.13 is that the maximum uplift does not occur in\n\nthe center of the thermal anomaly, but is shifted toward the direction of movement of the\n\nlithosphere relative to the thermal anomaly.

Other parameters of the model are shown in\n\n\n\n140 Chapter 7.

Concomitantly with\n\nthe movement of the thermal anomaly, the topography is eroded and the sediments are\n\ndeposited on the margin. Due to the parallelism of the topographic feature with the coast,\n\nthe supply of sediments to the coast is relatively uniform along the margin. Both surface\n\nand thermal loading are regionally compensated. During all the numerical simulation, the\n\nsea level is maintained at z = 0. The simulation occurs during 100 Myr (Figures 7.15, 7.16\n\n\n\n142 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\nFigure 7.17: Continuation of Figure 7.15. The red bars show the position of the Sections A\n\n(Figure 7.18) and B (Figure 7.19).\n\nand 7.17), and, during this period, the thermal anomaly crosses the entire model.\n\nTo analyze in detail the effect of the thermal anomaly on the passive margin, two\n\nsections are extracted from the model (Figure 7.17): Section A at y = 400 km (far from\n\nthe thermal anomaly); and Section B at y = 10 km (close to the thermal anomaly track).\n\nThe stratigraphic evolution of the margin in Sections A and B is shown in Figures 7.18\n\nand 7.19, respectively.\n\nIn Section A, where the influence of the thermal anomaly is less expressive, during the\n\nfirst stage of the model, erosion and unloading of the continent result in regional uplift of\n\nthe margin, producing stratal offlapping of the basin margin (Figures 7.18, 20-60 Myr).\n\nWhen the erosion of the continent occurs mainly far from the coast, the basin undergoes\n\npredominantly subsidence due to the sedimentary loading, causing a tenuous stratigraphic\n\nonlap of younger sediments onto older ones, as shown in Figures 7.18, 40-100 Myr. This\n\nofflapping and subsequent onlapping strata related to the flexural effects of the erosion of\n\nrift shoulders was previously observed by van Balen et al. (1995).\n\nIn Section B, the initial stratigraphic evolution is very similar to the one in Section\n\n\n\nSection 7.2.

But at 40 Myr, the presence of the thermal anomaly under\n\nthe margin results in regional uplift due to thermal heating of the lithosphere. This uplift\n\ninduces partial erosion of the sedimentary layers, producing a pattern of stratigraphic offlap\n\n(Figure 7.19, 40-60 Myr). After the passage of the thermal anomaly, the margin undergoes\n\nsubsidence due to the sedimentary loading and the thermal cooling of the lithosphere. This\n\nadditional subsidence results in a progressive overstepping of younger strata, producing a\n\nclear stratigraphic onlap (Figure 7.19, 80-100 Myr).\n\nThe stratigraphic features discussed in the previous lines is better visualized in Figure\n\n7.20, where both sections are presented at 100 Myr. Another aspect about the evolution\n\nof the margin is that, at the end of the simulation, the portion of the margin close to the\n\nthermal anomaly (Section B) presents a thinner and slightly wider sedimentary package\n\nthan the portions far from the thermal anomaly (Section A).\n\nFigure 7.21 shows the chronostratigraphy of the marginal basin through Sections A\n\nand B. We observe the formation of a hiatus (indicated as TUH - Thermal uplift hiatus in\n\nFigure 7.21) related to the uplift of the margin due to the passage of the thermal anomaly.\n\nThis hiatus does not appear in Section A. The continuous line in Figure 7.21 represents the\n\nposition of the thermal anomaly through time. Observe that the passage of the thermal\n\nuplift results initially in an erosional hiatus on the previously deposited strata, followed\n\nby a nondepositional hiatus. The combination of erosional and nondepositional hiatus\n\nproduces the TUH.\n\nIf the relative velocity vrel increases from 1 cm/yr to 2 cm/yr, the resulting chronostra-\n\ntigraphy of Section B (Figure 7.22) presents a TUH with nearly the same spatial extent of\n\nthe previous case, but the hiatus crosses a shorter time interval. This occurs because the\n\namplitude of the thermal uplift for vrel = 2 cm/yr is lower than for the case with vrel = 1\n\ncm/yr (see Figure 7.13) and the erosional hiatus is less expressive than in the previous\n\nmodel. Furthermore, the thermal subsidence after the passage of the thermal anomaly for\n\nthe model with vrel = 2 cm/yr is faster than in the previous model (Figure 7.14), and the\n\nnondepositional hiatus in the TUH is shorter in time.\n\nThe spatial and temporal extension of the TUH depends not only on the thermal\n\nmodel, but also on the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere and the dynamics of the surface\n\nprocesses. As an example, if the model with vrel = 1 cm/yr is rerun with a higher effective\n\n\n\n146 Chapter 7.

In this case, the passage of\n\nthe thermal anomaly under the lithosphere results in a broader uplift of the sedimentary\n\nstrata due to the higher rigidity, resulting in a more expressive influence of the TUH in\n\nthe chronostratigraphy of the basin, both in space and time (Figure 7.23).\n\nAs a second example, we considered the model vrel = 1 cm/yr with a higher flexural\n\nrigidity in the continent (Te = 20 km) than in the ocean (Te = 5 km). In this situation\n\nthe spatial and temporal extent of the TUH is significantly affected (Figure 7.24).

The evolution of this ridge has been associated with the\n\nrelative movement of the South American Plate and the Trindade Plume, resulting in the\n\nformation of a E-W volcanic track (e.g. O\u2019Connor and Duncan, 1990).\n\nClose to the margin, the Vito?ria-Trindade Chain is between the Campos and Esp??rito\n\nSanto Basins, and coincides with the north limit of the Vito?ria High and the south limit\n\nof the Esp??rito Santo Basin (Ferrari and Riccomini, 1999).\n\n\n\n148 Chapter 7.

As predicted by the\n\npresent numerical model, this relative velocity must reflect a perceptive transient uplift of\n\nthe lithosphere due to its thermal expansion.\n\nAnalyzing the residual topography, Ito and van Keken (2007) observed that the swell\n\nassociated with the Trindade Plume has a width of ?1330 km. Therefore, the passage of\n\nthe Trindade plume probably uplifted both Campos and Esp??rito Santo Basins.\n\nThe chronostratigraphy of the Campos basin is marked by an expressive hiatus crossing\n\nthe Paleocene and Eocene (Figure 7.26). The preserved Paleocene sedimentation occurs\n\nonly in deep water, characterized mainly by mudstones.

They propose that the lineament correspond\n\nto a fracture zone, and the magmatic activity were emplaced along the lineament through\n\nstructural discontinuities and the source of heating for the magmatism was a long-lived\n\nprocess of mantle upwelling lasting for ca. 210 Myr. In this case, the long-lived source of\n\nheat cannot be associated with the transient uplift of Campos Basin, unless the influence\n\nof this heat source significantly oscillated through time.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nw\nT \n\n(m\n)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n\nDistance to the center of the cylinder (km)\n\n0.5 Myr\n1.0 Myr1.5 Myr\n\nFigure 7.28: Uplift through time related to the emplacement of a vertical cylinder of ?2 km\n\nwide with T = 1300?C crossing the entire lithosphere. Local isostasy is assumed.\n\nOreiro et al. (2008) related the Cabo Frio Magmatic Lineament to partial melting of\n\nthe lithosphere by pressure release during reactivation of the fracture zone. To assess if\n\npressure release and the rapid injection of hot material through the lithosphere is capable\n\nto induce a transient uplift as observed in the margin, we simulated the thermal diffusion\n\nand the associated thermal uplift due to the instantaneous emplacement of a vertical\n\ncylinder of ?2 km wide with T = 1300?C crossing the entire lithosphere. The results\n\nshow that the thermal uplift rapidly vanishes after the emplacement of the hot material\n\n(Figure 7.28). Furthermore, the extent of the thermal anomaly through time is restricted\n\nto a few kilometers around the cylinder and the flexural compensation of this narrow\n\nfeature strongly smooth out the topographic expression of the thermal anomaly, even for\n\nlow flexural rigidity. Therefore, regional thermal uplift due to the injection of hot mantle\n\nthrough fractures in the lithosphere is unlikely.\n\nThese aspects favor the Trindade Plume as the source for the transient uplift observed\n\n\n\nSection 7.2. Post-rift influence of a thermal plume on passive margins 153\n\nin the Campos Basin. It is possible that the impingement of the Trindade Plume uplifted\n\nthe margin during the Eocene, contributing to part of the erosion of the Eocene and\n\nPaleocene sediments in the Campos Basin. Certainly other processes, like halokinesis and\n\nreactivation of faults (Winter et al., 2007), affected the evolution of the basin and hinder\n\nthe correct identification of the TUH. Probably, the thermal uplift due to the passage of\n\nthe Trindade Plume only contributed with part of the Eocene and Paleocene hiatus in the\n\nCampos Basin.\n\nUnlike the Campos Basin, the Esp??rito Santo Basin does not present expressive hiatus\n\nduring the Paleocene and Eocene, and the unconformities are restricted to the proximal\n\nregion (Figure 7.26). A possible explanation for this is that during this period, the pre-\n\ndominant sedimentation in the Esp??rito Santo Basin is characterized by shale, indicating\n\na deep depositional environment. In spite of this, Franc?a et al. (2007) observed that the\n\nstratigraphic sequence encompassing the Paleocene and the Early-Eocene present an offlap\n\npattern in the proximal region, indicating uplift of the margin (Figure 7.26). This sequence\n\nwas followed by the sedimentation during the Middle Eocene that resulted in stratigraphic\n\nonlap on the older strata (Franc?a et al., 2007). This proximal hiatus can be related to the\n\npassage of the Trindade Plume and the thermal heating of the lithosphere.\n\nAnother aspect to be considered is that the center of the plume does not need to\n\ncoincide with the Vito?ria-Trindade Chain. Ferrari and Riccomini (1999) proposed that the\n\nlineament of the chain is associated with a fracture zone that acted as a conduit for the\n\nmagmatism associated with the Trindade Plume. If the center of the Trindade Plume is not\n\nunder the Vito?ria-Trindade Chain, but is positioned southward of the chain, the Campos\n\nBasin was more influenced by the thermal uplift than the Esp??rito Santo Basin. However,\n\nthe verification of these conjectures need more information about the mantle structure, e.g.\n\nfrom seismic velocity maps in the mantle with better resolution through the improvement of\n\nthe coverage of the seismic networks including oceanic stations. Furthermore, geochemical\n\ndata can give important contributions to understand the nature and the origin of the\n\nTrindade Plume that formed the Vito?ria-Trindade Chain (Marques et al., 1999).\n\nIt is important to emphasize that, in our model, the thermal anomaly at the base of\n\nthe lithosphere does not need to be associated with a deep-mantle plume, but could be\n\nproduced by anomalous warm asthenosphere.\n\n\n\n154 Chapter 7. Application of the model to natural examples\n\n7.2.6 Conclusions\n\nThrough numerical models that couple thermal effects in the lithosphere, flexural isos-\n\ntasy and surface processes of erosion and deposition, the present work shows that the\n\nevolution of passive margins is significantly affected by the transient effect of a thermal\n\nanomaly at the base of the lithosphere.\n\nThe heating of the lithosphere and the associated thermal expansion may result in a\n\nlithospheric uplift of hundreds of meters that produces expressive unconformities in the\n\nmarginal basin.\n\nIt is shown that the higher the relative velocity between the lithosphere and the thermal\n\nanomaly, the lower the amplitude of the thermal uplift. On the other hand, an increase of\n\nthe relative velocity amplifies the rate of uplift or subsidence.\n\nBesides the dynamics of the surface processes and relative velocity of the lithosphere,\n\nthe effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere is an important parameter controlling the\n\nshape of the hiatus related to the thermal uplift.\n\nThis study proposes that the passage of the Trindade Plume beneath the Southeastern\n\nBrazilian margin resulted in thermal heating of the lithosphere and consequent uplift of\n\nthe margin, creating unconformities in the Campos and Esp??rito Santo Basins during the\n\nPaleocene and Eocene.\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nFinal remarks\n\nNo substantial part of the universe is so simple\n\nthat it can be grasped and controlled without abstraction.\n\nAbstraction consists in replacing the part of the universe under\n\nconsideration by a model of similar but simpler structure.\n\n(Rosenblueth and Wiener, 1945)\n\nThe numerical model presented here proved to be an useful tool to study the evolution\n\nof divergent margins since the beginning of rifting. Through this model it was possible\n\nto evaluate the relative importance of the different surface and tectonic processes on the\n\nevolution of rifted margins.\n\nThe incorporation of lithospheric stretching and rifting in the numerical model was an\n\nimportant aspect to obtain new insights into the evolution of escarpments in divergent\n\nmargins. It was shown in Section 7.1 that the amount of extension during rifting can\n\ndisplace the position of the escarpment from the rift flank toward an inland position,\n\nmany kilometers landward, depending on the flexural rigidity of the upper crust. This\n\nmodel can be further tested by studying in greater details the distribution of extension in\n\npassive margins and confronting the model with thermochronological data.\n\nThe results from the numerical models presented in Section 7.2 showed how the passage\n\nof a thermal anomaly under the lithosphere generates a transient lithospheric uplift of\n\nhundreds of meters related to thermal expansion. It is also shown how this transient uplift\n\ncan affect the evolution of sedimentary basins in passive margins, resulting in offlapping\n\nfollowed by onlapping strata. The hiatus in the sedimentary basin related to the thermal\n\nuplift depends not only on the dynamics of the surface processes and the thermal anomaly,\n\n\n\n156 Chapter 8. Final remarks\n\nbut also on the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere, both in the ocean and in the\n\nadjacent continent.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the kinematic model for lithospheric stretching used\n\nin the present work is a simple description for the rifting process and does not take into\n\naccount the dynamic effects related to strain-dependent rheologies. This simple model can\n\nbe modified in the future, considering dynamical models for stretching (e.g. Buck et al.,\n\n2003; Huismans and Beaumont, 2003).\n\nAdditionally, the coupling of the processes in this work can be improved. In the present\n\nnumerical model, the kinematic model for faulting and stretching of the lithosphere affects\n\nthe other processes but is not affected by them (Figure 6.1). Indeed, the modification of\n\nthe thermal state of the lithosphere influences its rheological behavior and consequently the\n\nrifting style (Buck, 1993). Likewise, erosion and deposition also affect the thermal state of\n\nthe lithosphere and consequently its rigidity (Lavier and Steckler, 1997). Moreover, flexural\n\nisostasy modifies the stress state of the lithosphere and can influence the formation of faults\n\nin the crust.\n\nCertainly, there are uncountable conditions to be tested in new models, coupling all\n\nthe processes cited above, aiming to better describe and understand the interactions of\n\nthe surface and tectonic processes. On the other hand, the development of new numerical\n\nmodels must be guided by the idea that models are \u201crepresentations of reality\u201d, useful for\n\nleading to further research. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis for the different parameters\n\nthat compose the numerical model is an important step to identify the processes that are\n\nreally important for the problem and clarify \u201cwhich aspects of the system are most in need\n\nof further study, and where more empirical data are most needed\u201d (Oreskes et al., 1994).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAhnert, F.

At x = 0 the plate is under the\n\naction of a line load V0 (Figure A.1a).\n\n(a)\n\nD2 D1\nV0\n\n(b)\nV2\n\nM2\n\nV1\n\nM1\n\nFigure A.1: (a) Scheme of the problem of an infinite elastic plate with two different rigidities\n\nD1 and D2 under a line load V0. (b) Representation of the continuous plate by two semi-\n\ninfinite plates. The moments M1 and M2 and the line loads V1 and V2 represent the coupling\n\nof the two halves.\n\n\n\n176 Appendix A. Flexure of an elastic plate with an abrupt rigidity variation under a line load\n\nTo solve this problem analytically, a good strategy is to divide the plate in two halves\n\nand treat each half as a semi-infinite plate (Figure A.1b), broken at x = 0. To represent\n\nthe coupling of the halves and the continuity between them as in the original plate, it is\n\nimposed bending moments M1 and M2 and line loads V1 and V2 on the edges of the plates.\n\nThe equation that describes the flexure of this plate can be obtained from Equation\n\n2.1 and eliminating the derivative with respect to y:\n\nd2\n\ndx2\n\n(\nD(x)\n\nd2w\n\ndx2\n\n)\n? q = 0\n\nSince the applied load is zero except at x = 0, the only vertical force comes from the\n\nbuoyancy force ??gw:\nd2\n\ndx2\n\n(\nD(x)\n\nd2w\n\ndx2\n\n)\n+ ?gw = 0 (A.1)\n\nThe general solution for Equation A.1 is\n\nw = ex/?\n(\nc1 cos\n\nx\n\n?\n+ c2 sin\n\nx\n\n?\n\n)\n+ e?x/?\n\n(\nc3 cos\n\nx\n\n?\n+ c4 sin\n\nx\n\n?\n\n)\n(A.2)\n\nwhere c1, c2, c3 and c4 are constants obtained from the boundary conditions and ? is the\n\nflexural parameter (? =\n[\n\n4D\n?g\n\n]1/4\n).\n\nFar from the load vector the deflection w ? 0. Therefore, the equation A.2 becomes\n\nfor the right plate\n\nw1 = e\n?x/?1\n\n(\nc3 cos\n\nx\n\n?1\n+ c4 sin\n\nx\n\n?1\n\n)\n(A.3)\n\nand for the left plate\n\nw2 = e\nx/?2\n\n(\nc1 cos\n\nx\n\n?2\n+ c2 sin\n\nx\n\n?2\n\n)\n(A.4)\n\nwhere ?1 =\n[\n\n4D1\n?g\n\n]1/4\nand ?2 =\n\n[\n4D2\n?g\n\n]1/4\n.\n\nFor the right plate the bending moment at x = 0 is M1. The bending moment is the\n\nflexural rigidity of the plate divided by the radius of curvature of the plate Rcurv (Turcotte\n\nand Schubert, 1982).

Analytical proof of the \u201cwater load delay\u201d approximation\n\nB.3 Exact solution for nonzero rigidity\n\nThe \u201cwater load delay\u201d approximation is also valid when the rigidity of the plate is\n\nnot null. To show this, consider an elastic plate with rigidity D. Assume that the plate is\n\nunder the action of a periodic load\n\n(?s ??w)ghq1\n\nwhere\n\nhq1 = hlcos(?x)\n\nand assume that the isostatic compensation occurs under the water, implying that ?? =\n\n?m ??w.

Therefore, equation B.9 becomes\n\nD\n?4w?1\n?x4\n\n+ ?mgw\n?\n1 = (?s ??w)ghq1. (B.12)\n\nresulting in\n\nw?1 = hq1\n(?s ??w)g\nD?4 + ?mg\n\n(B.13)\n\nAssume that the load in the next step is (?s ? ?w)gh?q2 = (?s ? ?w)gw?1. Taking into\n\naccount also the load of the water from the previous step ?wgw\n?\n1, the total load in the\n\nsecond step is:\n\n(?s ??w)gw?1 + ?wgw\n?\n1 = ?sgw\n\n?\n1.\n\nTherefore, the equation for w?2 is\n\nD\n?4w?2\n?x4\n\n+ ?mgw\n?\n2 = ?sghq2\n\nresulting in\n\nw?2 = hq2\n?sg\n\nD?4 + ?mg\n= w?1\n\n?sg\n\nD?4 + ?mg\n= w?1r\n\n?\nD\n\nIt is possible to observe that the deflection w?n of the step n is of the following form\n\nw?n = w\n?\n1r\n?n?1\nD\n\nand the total deflection w?total is\n\nw?total = w\n?\n1\n\n??\nn=1\n\nr?n?1D = w\n?\n1\n\n1\n\n1 ? r?D\n.\n\nTherefore\n\nw?total = w\n?\n1\n\n1\n\n1 ? r?D\n= w?1\n\nD?4 + ?mg\n\nD?4 + (?m ??s)g\n.\n\nFrom B.13:\n\nw?total = hq1\n(?s ??w)g\nD?4 + ?mg\n\nD?4 + ?mg\n\nD?4 + (?m ??s)g\n= hq1\n\n(?s ??w)g\nD?4 + (?m ??s)g\n\n. (B.14)\n\nComparing equations B.11 and B.14 it is possible to see that the total deflection are\n\nthe same (wtotal = w\n?\ntotal) in both cases. This shows that the algorithm presented in section\n\n6.4 converges to the exact solution even when D > 0.\n\n\n\n184 Appendix B. Analytical proof of the \u201cwater load delay\u201d approximation\n\nB.5 Conclusions\n\nAs shown in the examples of the previous sections, the \u201cwater load delay\u201d approxima-\n\ntion converges to the exact solution, independent of the flexural rigidity of the plate.\n\nIn this approximation, the isostatic equilibrium is not instantaneously achieved during\n\nthe loading, but is gradually reached in the following time steps. Actually, almost all the\n\nisostatic equilibrium is achieved in first few time steps after loading.\n\nFor example, for D = 0, the exact subsidence w1 due to the load of a sedimentary layer\n\nof thickness hw is (see equation B.3)\n\nw1 = hw\n?s ??w\n?m ??w\n\nIn the first step in the \u201cwater load delay\u201d approximation, the subsidence w?1 is (see\n\nequationB.13)\n\nw?1 = hw\n?s ??w\n?m\n\nwhich represents almost 69% of the exact subsidence, for ?m = 3300 kg/m\n3 and ?w = 1030\n\nkg/m3. Without additional sedimentary loading, the subsidence continues in the second\n\ntime step due to the layer o water w?1, resulting in\n\nw?2 = w\n?\n1\n\n?w\n?m\n\n.\n\nThe summation w?1 + w\n?\n2 represents 90% of the exact subsidence.\n\nThe subsidence continues in the following steps, approaching the exact solution:\n\nw?n = w\n?\n1\n\n[\n?w\n?m\n\n]n?1\n.\n\nIn the third step, the total subsidence is 97% of the exact subsidence, and in the fourth\n\nstep, the total subsidence is 99%.\n\nAs the time step is small in the numerical model (102 ? 103 years) relative to the\n\ncharacteristic time of the different geological processes involved, the \u201cwater load delay\u201d\n\napproximation works almost like the exact solution considering the load of water instan-\n\ntaneously.\n\n\n\tIntroduction\n\tSurface and tectonic processes: a complex system\n\tThe purpose of this work\n\n\tFlexure and isostasyThe numerical model described in this chapter was presented in the article of *Sacek2009.\n\tIntroduction\n\tFlexure of a thin elastic plate and its numerical solution\n\tThe choice of the finite element\n\tConstruction of the stiffness matrix K and the load vector f\n\tApplying the boundary conditions and solving the linear system\n\tComparison with analytical solutions\n\n\tThermal model\n\tIntroduction\n\tHeat transfer equation and its numerical solution\n\tThe choice of the finite element\n\tConstruction of the linear system\n\tComparison with analytical solutions\n\n\tStretching of the lithosphere\n\tIntroduction\n\tThe upwelling divergent flow\n\tThe flexural cantilever model\n\n\tSurface processes\n\tIntroduction\n\tMathematical description of the surface processes\n\tGeneration of the irregular mesh and discretization of the surface\n\tIrregular distribution of the points\n\tDelaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagrams\n\n\tFormulation of the surface processes in the irregular mesh\n\tOnshore and offshore diffusion\n\tFluvial processes\n\n\tExample\n\n\tCoupling of the processes\n\tThe coupling of stretching, thermal and flexural models\n\tModification of the surface processes due to faulting\n\tFlexure and isostatic compensation\n\tThe ``water load delay'' algorithm\n\n\tApplication of the model to natural examples\n\tThe influence of rifting on escarpment migrationThis section is part of the submitted article of *Sacek2011a.
