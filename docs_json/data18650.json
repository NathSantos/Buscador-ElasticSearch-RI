The move between small and localized observations centred on a \nfew Islands to a general plan to study the whole triple junction area required a multitude \nof means, a multidisciplinary approach and a significant level of logistics. \n\nOne piece of the global effort was organized in Portugal through the research project \nSTAMINA. Even if the two cruises planned in the scoope of this project, were never \ncompleted, it gathered a variety of geophysical, geochemical, geodetic and tectonic \nteams that organized their effort in the same scientific problem. It also allowed the \nmeans to coordinate the national participation in a series of research operations led by \nthe international community where we had the opportunity to act as active partners and \nbenefit from their much better technical means.  \n\nIn what concerns this work, those cruise limitations were important in the amount of \nnew swath bathymetry data acquired (6.5 hours of high quality EM300 swath \nbathymetry data collected as piggy back to the main SIRENA I cruise; PI J. Jean \nGoslin); several hours more of magnetic data collected over the Serreta eruption site \nwest of Terceira Island again marginally to the SIRENA II cruise. Such a data scarcity \nled to the broadening of the thesis objectives thematically although centred in the \nAzores, still the core of this work. The scientific objectives remained under the umbrella \nof \u201cthe volcano-tectonic interactions\u201d but with a broader spatial and temporal scale to \nallow integration of other research topics \n\nTo improve efficiency of research and overcome data availability limitations, we \ndeveloped a set of collaborations with foreign partners in complementary lines of \nresearch, (Peter Cobbold; Jean Goslin) and a stronger focus on the cooperation with the \nremaining STAMINA colleagues: Fernando Ornelas Marques (Tectonics, University of \nLisbon); Rui Fernandes (Geodesy, University of  Beira Interior), Jo\u00e3o Catal\u00e3o \n(Geodesy, University of Lisbon), All these collaborations resulted in a number of \npublications, currently in preparation, submitted or already published. The current \nmanuscript is constructed with a large amount of this material collated into a single \nvolume. Some original texts have been enhanced whereas others have been edited, \nreduced or focused on specific topics related with the manuscript theme. \n \n\n i \n\n\n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nNOME:   Jo\u00e3o Nuno Vilhena de Sousa Louren\u00e7o \nFACULDADE:  Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias do Mar e Ambiente \nORIENTADORES:  Jorge Miguel Alberto Miranda \n\nAnt\u00f3nio Augusto Ramos Ribeiro \nDATA:   22 de Janeiro de 2007 \nT\u00cdTULO DA TESE:  Processos tectono-magm\u00e1ticos na Jun\u00e7\u00e3o Tripla dos A\u00e7ores \n\n \n\nResumo \n\nApresentam-se resultados de estudos multi-disciplinares, centrados na interac\u00e7\u00e3o \nespacio-temporal entre o Ponto Quente dos A\u00e7ores (PQA) e a Jun\u00e7\u00e3o Tripla dos A\u00e7ores \n(JTA) no decurso da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o geodin\u00e2mica da plataforma vulc\u00e2nica dos A\u00e7ores e \nsintetiza-se um modelo tectono-magm\u00e1tico para a JTA na actualidade. \n\nDesde os 33.4 Ma o regime tect\u00f3nico prevalecente \u00e9 trans-tractivo com rota\u00e7\u00e3o \nprogressiva das direc\u00e7\u00f5es de abertura Eur\u00e1sia-Africa de ca.

In addition a tectono-magmatic model of the ATJ for the present day is \nsummarized. \n\nSince 33.4 Ma, the dominant tectonic regime is transtensional with progressive rotation \nof the Eurasia-Africa opening directions from ca. N-S to ca. ENE-WSW. Since that \nearly age, the Azores present a kinematic behavior which is independent from that of \nthe larger plates and possibly dominated by distributed deformation.  \n\nThe maximum interaction between the AHS and the ATJ occurs between the 20 and 10 \nMa. Consequently, between 33.4 and 20 Ma the evolution of the Azores has been \nprominently a result of tectonic controls and had little influence of the AHS. \n\nThe growth of the linear volcanic ridges (LVR) is interpreted as the result of the \nprogressive migration of the ATJ, since ca. 15 Ma, from an intra-transform context, \ntowards NW. Their propagation subsists in the present day, now towards WNW. \n\nThe modeling of GPS data has allowed to constrain in the present day, the Eurasia-\nNubia plate boundary along the Terceira axis and in the Pico-Faial alignment. It is \nsuggested that the inter-plate zone adjoining this two active axis, corresponds to a \ndomain of non-coaxial distributed deformation dominated by transtension. In this zone \nthere is a partition between rifting processes (dominated by magmatism)  in pure \ntension, normal to the LVR axis, and shear processes characterized by left lateral strike \nslips (along NNW-SSE) and relay zones (along WSW-ENE). Contrastingly, the faulting \npattern, east of Terceira Island suggests prevalence of co-axial oblique extension, \nfocalized within the Terceira axis, and a stress field with maximum compressive axis \nvertical, and minimum compressive axis sub-parallel to the opening directions predicted \nby NUVEL-1A or GPS based (e.g REVEL, DEOS2K) kinematic models.      \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Azores Triple Junction; Azores Hot-Spot; Sismo-tectonics; elastic modeling; linear volcanic \n\nridges; distributed deformation. \n\n v \n\n\n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\n \n\nMiguel Miranda was my compellingly enthusiastic supervisor and PI of STAMINA, \nunder which most of the recent data sets used in this PhD project, were acquired. \nMiguel has always stroke me with his capacity of finding some shed of bright light in a \nsometimes all black scenario, for example, when all the cruises scheduled for the \nAzores \u201csank\u201d. I acknowledge him, the countless discussions we had about different \nAzores and other topics, his critical review of this manuscript, and above all for making \nme face new challenges and pushing me forward in what concerns scientific research. \nSTAMINA project from FCT sponsored all the Azores field work and my visits to \nRennes University. \n\nAnt\u00f3nio Ribeiro was my co-supervisor on this thesis from the beginning. I thank him \nthe thoughtful review of this manuscript and his sharing of views and opinions both in \nthe field when discussing Terceira Island tectonics in the Azores and at the office, in a \ngreat variety of issues His constant availability during this work is greatly appreciated \nby me. \n\nThe work with Fernando Ornelas Marques, within STAMINA project, particularly \nduring several field campaigns in the Azores for tectonic mapping and field \nobservations, gave me the opportunity to have new insights in the analysis of geological \nprocesses. I am also indebt to Fernando for his availability and for introducing me to \nanalogue modelling techniques. Although some of the work of this manuscript is the \ndirect result of this collaboration, it does not make justice to the overall benefices of my \nlearning process from Fernando. \n\nI thank Joaquim Lu\u00eds, for continuously providing me copies of his software, which I \nused intensively during the course of this work. Additionally, Joaquim has always been \na source of fruitful discussions on the many different questions regarding the Azores \nand Geophysics. \n\nJo\u00e3o Alveirinho Dias, was my coordinator at the University Algarve and gave me the \nopportunity to realize this extensive research program. These acknowledgments are \nextensible to my collegues in the Algarve University: Oscar Ferreira, Ana Barbosa, \nCristina Pires, Delminda Moura and Tomasz Boski, for their friendship and support. \n\n \n\n vii \n\n\n\n \nAcknoledgments \n \n\n \nDuring this work time span I had the privilege to meet Jean Goslin, a skilled senior \nresearcher from UBO (Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Occidental) which became a very good \nfriend. With Jean Goslin, we sailed two missions (SIRENA I and II). The SIRENA I \nwith heavy roll and pitch during most of the sailing will never be forgotten. \n\nI benefited also from a 3 month scholarship sponsored by IFREMER-ICCTI protocol in \nthe framework of French-Portuguese bilateral agreements, which enabled me to \nparticipate in the SIRENA data processing and analysis at IUEM \u2013 Brest, along with Dr. \nRobert Dziak from NOAA, which provided numerous and valuable insights on the \nstrategy for the data processing and analysis.  This stay was the natural prolongation of \nthe good time spent at sea. I am indebt to Jean Goslin and his family, Julie Perrot, \nChristophe Martin, J. Y. Royer from the SIRENA team and remaining staff of IUEM \nwith whom I contacted during my stay, for this profitable and enjoyable visit.  \u201cMerci a \ntous pour votre super accueil \u00e0 Brest\u201d. \n\nI thank Peter Cobbold for sharing with me new ideas on the role of fluids in deformation \nand for the level of exigence and rigor he imposes in the research work. This led to the \nimprovement in the quality of my own work. I acknowledge also the help of my \ncolleagues particularly: Nuno Rodrigues, Regis Morgues, J J Kemarrec and Xavier Le \nFort during my stay in Geoscience Rennes in the Analogue modeling lab. \n\nI thank the researchers of CGUL with whom I worked for a long time: Maria Ana \nBaptista, Luis Matias, Fernando Santos and Pedro Soares. Pedro Silva has been my \nclose \u201ccompagnon de route\u201d for most of this work and helped forming a united front to \nsurvive Miguel\u2019s barbarian provocations when our soccer club was in disgrace! Nuno \nDias, also a PhD student in seismology of the Azores assured a fruitful cooperation and \ninformation exchange which benefited this (and hopefully his) work.  \n\nPedro Madureira (from U. \u00c9vora) also a PhD student in geochemistry and petrology of \nthe Azores, is first of all a very close friend, and secondly a colleague with whom I had \nenormous discussions about the Azores and the interpretation of our data. Pedro has \nshowed me quite clearly that I ceased to be a full bodied geologist, but I am still not a \ngeophysicist. Thank you Pedro for the proof of my precarious position! \n\nA large amount of this manuscript was written while I was at the EMEPC. I am deeply \nthankful to the head of this organization, Manuel Pinto de Abreu, its Technical \nCoordinator, Fernando Maia Pimentel and remaining EMEPC colleagues for their \nsupport.  \n\n viii \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nMy Family is grand. Mother: thank you for having revised the manuscript. Father: \nthanks for pointing me, at times, the north, and remembering me (in those times) that \nserenity is not just a word. \n\nTo my wife Raquel, no written acknowledgement makes justice to what she had to put \nup with me.  I guess a thank you with the size of the Azores Plateau, for your patience, \nsupport and help is in order and says it all. This manuscript final stages (or at least my \nstrength to accomplish it) also largely benefited from the smiles and laughs of my \ndaughters Rita and Maria. \n\nWhile the work benefited from many discussions and collaborations with the above \nstated colleagues, all misconceptions or errors present in this manuscript are my full \nresponsibility.  \n\n ix \n\n\n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nContents \n\n \n\n \nPrologue.................................................................................................................................................... i \nResumo ................................................................................................................................................... iii \nAbstract.....................................................................................................................................................v \nAcknowledgments ................................................................................................................................. v i i\n\ni\n\nr\n\nContents.................................................................................................................................................. xi \nList of Figures.........................................................................................................................................xv \nList of Tables ...................................................................................................................................... xx ii \nChapter I - Int oduction ...........................................................................................................................1 \nChapter II - Review of the kinematic Models for the ATJ and AHS .................................................... 11 \n\nII.1 Overview......................................................................................................................................... 11 \nII.2 ATJ Models based on plate kinematic reconstructions ................................................................... 12 \n\nII.2.1 The ATJ prior to 20 Ma: from Kings through to Gloria Fault ....................................................................... 12 \nII.2.2 The ATJ prior to 20 Ma: from Gloria fault to Terceira axis or to EAFZ? ................................................... 15 \nII.2.3 The ATJ in the last 10 Ma: fine scale evolution of Triple Junction .................................................................. 18 \n\nII.3 Testing two kinematic models for the evolution of the ATJ ........................................................... 20 \nII.3.1 Constraints provided by stage pole rotations..................................................................................................... 25 \nII.3.2 Is the Pico FZ the structural homologue of the EAFZ? .................................................................................. 30 \n\nII.4 The Azores Hotspot ........................................................................................................................ 37 \nII.4.1 Nature of the Azores Hot-Spot (AHS)......................................................................................................... 38 \nII.4.2 Spatial location of the hot spot ........................................................................................................................ 40 \nII.4.3 Dynamics of the Azores Hot Spot.................................................................................................................. 41 \n\nII.5 Discussion ....................................................................................................................................... 44 \nII.5.1 Interaction between the Azores Hot Spot and the Azores Triple Junction ........................................................ 44 \nII.5.2 Onset of SATJ northwards Migration............................................................................................................ 48 \n\nII.6 Conclusions..................................................................................................................................... 50 \nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on MAR Seismicity ...............................................................53 \n\nIII.1 Hydrophone Arrays ....................................................................................................................... 53 \nIII.2.

The Western group (two Islands) is \n\nlocated in the stable North America plate, whilst the Central (five Islands) and the \n\nEastern (two Islands) groups lie in the Eurasian (EU)-Nubian (NUB) plate boundary \n\narea. The Azores Islands, themselves, represent a small emerged area of a vast \n\nsubmarine volcanic platform. This platform, roughly defined by the 2000 m isobath, is \n\nrelatable to an excess in volcanism/magmatism. It presents a triangular shape, whose \n\nwestern side is located west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is limited to the south by the \n\nEast Azores Fracture Zone and to the northwest by the Terceira axis (Machado, 1957). \n\nWithin the Azores plateau a large V-shaped volcanic feature roughly bisected by the \n\nMAR, designated hereafter as Faial ridge and Flores ridge (after Vogt 1976) is probably \n\na result of a major thermal or magmatic event under the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 10 Ma, \n\nreflecting the interaction between the so-called Azores hot spot and the Mid-Atlantic \n\nridge (Cannat et al., 1999; Escartin et al., 2001, Gente et al., 2003).  \n\nThe precise location of the MAR (Figure I.1), which forms the boundary between the \n\nNorth American and Eurasian/Nubian plates is well known, particular after the efforts \n\ndeveloped  in  recent  years  to  map  the ridge system in the Azores area; in contrast, the  \n\n 1 \n\n\n\n \nChapter I - Introduction \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure I.1 - Regional bathymetry of the Azores Plateau with main morphological features discussed \nin the text (Gente, 2003). \n\n \n\nexact details and nature of the boundary between the Eurasian and Nubian plates, its \n\nlocation  and  segmentation  pattern , the  evolution of this triple junction and the way in \n\nwhich tectonic and volcanic processes interact, within the plate boundary zone, remain \n\nunclear, and has been elusive to geophysical and geological studies, in spite of the \n\nefforts developed.  \n\n 2 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nThe plate boundary between Eurasia and Africa is generally characterized in its \n\nwesternmost part by transtension in a complex area striking WNW-ESE, the Terceira \n\nAxis, linking the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the Gloria fault. The spreading rates across the \n\nplate boundary in the Terceira axis, between Eurasia and African plates amount to 4 \n\nmm/yr in an average N75\u00b0E direction (Euler rotation pole located at 19.5\u00b0N, 23.7\u00b0W, \n\nDemets et al., 1994). The direction of motion predicted by the global kinematic model \n\ndoes not account for all structure orientations and their variations from south to north \n\n(Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998).  \n\nThe internal structure of the plateau (Figure I.2) displays a coherent structure of linear \n\nvolcanic ridges developed along fissure systems roughly aligned sub-parallel to the \n\nTerceira Axis (Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998). This axis presents a marked clockwise rotation \n\nfrom N110-120\u00ba near its intersection with the MAR and which mostly characterizes the \n\ncentral Islands (Pico, S\u00e3o Jorge, Terceira); to directions closer to N140\u00ba-150\u00ba at its \n\nintersection with the GLORIA fault. These directions appear to characterize the tectonic \n\npattern on the Islands and in the extensional basins between them, as well as some \n\nelongated, volcanic ridges. Guest et al. (1999) suggested that the conical volcanic \n\nedifices are emplaced at the intersection of tectonic structures with both directions. In \n\nparticular, the Furnas volcano on S\u00e3o Miguel Island, displays such a tectonic setting. \n\nThe seismic activity that constitutes the best tool to trace plate boundaries and interplate \n\ndeformation processes, is characterized by earthquakes with focal mechanisms \n\ncompatible with right-lateral strike-slip faults or normal faults, oriented N120\u00b0E to \n\nN150\u00b0E (Grimison and Chen, 1986; Buforn et al., 1988). A strong earthquake (M=7.2), \n\nhowever, occurred in 1980, probably on a left-lateral strike-slip fault oriented N150\u00b0E, \n\naccording to its focal mechanism and the aftershock distribution (Hirn et al., 1980), \n\n 3 \n\n\n\n \nChapter I - Introduction \n \n \nimplying that the kinematics is not simple in the area. The focal mechanism for the 1998 \n\nFaial earthquake showed also a complex fracture pattern (Fernandes et al., 2002). \n\nThe volcanic activity is distributed over all the Central and Eastern Azores Islands, and \n\nall record  historical activity. The most recent volcanic activity occurred on the Serreta \n\nridge (Luis et al., 1999), northwest of Terceira Island. The WNW-ESE-trending zone of \n\nvolcanic and tectonic activity, which also marks the northeast boundary of the Azores \n\nplateau, is a rift zone, with a significant part of transtensional motion (leaky transform).  \n\nThe ages of the Azores Plateau, the Terceira axis, and the linear volcanic ridge \n\nstructures within the plateau are still unclear. Little constraint is provided by magnetic \n\nanomalies in what concerns islands evolution, and isotopic age determinations only \n\nprovide an upper bound for the age of these structures. Little is also known about the \n\nthermal structure (or lithospheric structure) of the Terceira axis and the partition, style \n\nand dynamics between magmatic and tectonic processes which have shaped the plate \n\nboundary and the Azores plateau.  \n\nAn analysis based on an aeromagnetic survey and the compilation of ship born magnetic \n\ndata of the plateau showed that only the Brunhes and possibly Matuyama magnetic \n\nepochs can be identified in the rift area, even though the magnetic anomalies generated \n\nalong the mid-Atlantic ridge are disrupted on the plateau (Miranda et al., 1991, Luis et \n\nal.,  1994).  The lack of   older magnetic   lineations   on either   side   of   the Terceira \n\nrift suggests that the relative motion between Africa and Eurasia in the westernmost part \n\nof the plate boundary was accommodated by extension distributed across the plateau \n\nrather than by accretion focused along the rift. Major questions on the kinematics and \n\nthe dynamics of the area are therefore still unresolved: \n\n 4 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I.2 - Detailed bathymetry of the Azores plateau from Louren\u00e7o et al., (1998).

Can we describe the area bounded by two branches of the Eurasia-Africa plate \n\nboundary as a microplate? Is the triple junction a discrete feature or a complex zone? \n\nHow is the relative motion between Africa and Eurasia accommodated in the \n\nwesternmost part of the plate boundary? Is the motion distributed across the Azores \n\nplateau? Or does the Terceira rift account for all the relative motion?  \n\nIn the following chapters, we will address some of this questions and present results \n\nfrom studies in which the author has been involved between 1999 and 2006. The Azores \n\nplateau is a particularly suitable area to study tectono-magmatic interactions in space \n\nand time and at different scales. It comprises the existence of a disputed plume or at \n\nleast a significant upper mantle anomaly, hereafter refered as the Azores Hot-Spot \n\n(AHS) which is considered the main intervining factor for the formation of the Azores \n\nvolcanic plateau.  The internal structure of this plateau can be explained by interaction \n\nalong time of the AHS with both the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and the Azores Triple \n\nJunction (ATJ. Significant consequences of this interaction are: the position, kinematic \n\nand related tectonic response of the ATJ, the distribution of magmatic contribution for \n\nlithospheric structure and thermal structure of the Azores plateau and on the \n\ngeophysical, geological and biological segmentation pattern of the MAR through time.  \n\nTo understand the plateau inner structure and the consequences of AHS-ATJ-MAR \n\ninteraction it is crucial that plate kinematic constraints are provided. Several kinematic \n\ninterpretations have been provided in the past, but all of them fail to integrate a \n\n 6 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nsignificant portion of currently available multi-disciplinary data on the Azores plateau. \n\nIn Chapter II, we review critically kinematic models described in the literature; discuss \n\nthe interactions with the AHS they propose. We use morpho-structural and marine \n\nmagnetic data on the Azores and we analyse the consequence of assuming different \n\npositions in time for the ATJ (i.e. the EU/NUB plate boundary), and test plate tectonic \n\nreconstructions using Euler stage poles from existing kinematic models. The main \n\nobjective is to evaluate relative ages for the generation of first order bathymetric \n\nfeatures within the plateau and try to constrain the expectable tectonic response within \n\nthe plateau at each considered geodynamic time interval. \n\nOne of the strategies designed to identify the effects of the present day AHS influence is \n\nthe mapping of seismicity resulting from volcanic and tectonic activity along the MAR.  \n\nThis can be done very efficiently with the use of hydrophone arrays, a technique \n\ndeveloped for submarine acoustic surveying that is now available for scientific use. This \n\nis discussed in Chapter III. \n\nThe spreading velocities deduced from global models like NUVEL 1A (DeMets et al., \n\n1994) or based exclusively on GPS-derived models like REVEL (Sella et al., 2002) or \n\nDEOS2K (Fernandes et al., 2004) yield reduced full spreading velocities, varying from \n\n3 to 4 mm per year (ultra-slow spreading ridges are classified as such for full spreading \n\nvelocities below 1 cm/yr) for the EU/NUB plate boundary in the Azores. This allows \n\nthe classification of this ridge as one of the slowest of the ridge global system (or hyper-\n\nslow, following Vogt and Jung (2003).  The spatial distribution of the geodetically \n\nretrieved deformation field starts now to be understood. This is discussed in Chapter IV.  \n\n 7 \n\n\n\n \nChapter I - Introduction \n \n \nThe short time span of geodetic observations only provides a snapshot of present day \n\nkinematic context, which relevance from the tectonic point of view is at least partially \n\nunknown. In Chapter V, we present and discuss complementary kinematic and tectonic \n\nmarkers of active processes that can be identified from the morphotectonic analysis of \n\nhigh resolution TOBI sonar. \n\nThis type of approach can be made systematically in the Terceira Island and \n\nneighbouring areas, where we tentatively infer how tectonics and volcanism do \n\ndistribute and relate to each other. This is the aim of chapter VI. Here we will describe \n\nin detail the morphology and main geophysical characteristics of an area comprising \n\nTerceira Island and its neighbouring basins along the Terceira axis. The way volcanic \n\nand tectonic structures condition each other is analysed by integrating high resolution \n\nbathymetry and sonar on submerged areas where some new swath and sonar data have \n\nbeen collected with high resolution digital elevation models of the Terceira Island and \n\nmeso-scale tectonic observations.  A regional tectonic map is assembled and analysed. \n\nDirectional data are compared with expected EU/NUB differential motion and \n\nconsequently an assessement of fault kinematics and the role they play in magmatic \n\naccretion in that domain of Terceira axis is performed. \n\nThe smallest spatio-temporal scale is approached in this manuscript considering the \n\nsequence of tectono-magmatic events that took place in the 1957 and 1958 Capelinhos \n\neruption in Faial. In Chapter VII we discuss and interpret the sequence of events which \n\nresulted on the Surtseyan eruption type (despite that the Faial eruption was prior to the \n\n1963-1966 Surtsey Island eruption in Iceland) and triggered two strong tectonic shocks \n\nin faults neighbouring the volcanic fissural system, that links the Island main caldera \n\nand the eruption site in its western tip. Geodetic and GPS data for 60 years are \n\n 8 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \ncompared with 2D crustal dislocations models, resultant from fault slip data inversion. \n\nA geological interpretation is then performed, about the eruption driving mechanism, \n\nthe earthquakes triggering mechanism and the style of accretion in this linear volcanic \n\nsystems which constitute a significant part of the Azores plateau. \n\nIn Chapter VIII we use analogue modelling techniques to analyse the effect of ridge \n\npush in ridge extension and transform fault generation, and in particular the case for \n\nactive transform faults which, contrary to what is expectable from fault mechanics, lie \n\nnormal to the ridge axis. Despite approaching normal seafloor spreading ridge sections, \n\nthis topic is relevant within the context of the EU-NUB plate boundary, as in the later \n\nthere are evidences from earthquake activity and fault mapping that similar orthogonal \n\ngeometries exist within the Azores. \n\nFinally Chapter IX we perform the discussion of the data presented in this manuscript \n\nand integrate them into a coherent tectonic model for the ruling kinematics conditions at \n\nthe EU-NUB plate boundary and ATJ at the present day. Topics for future researches in \n\nthis complex geodynamical framework are also underlined. \n\n \n\n  \n\n 9 \n\n\n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nChapter II - Review of the kinematic Models for the ATJ and AHS \n\nII.1 Overview \n\nThe evolution and shaping of the Azores Plateau is usually considered as the result of \n\nthe interaction between two key processes: the ATJ instability and the Azores Hot Spot \n\n(AHS) position in the course of time. Past interpretative models, addressing their roles, \n\nput little emphasis on their interactions and consequent implications to the birth and \n\nevolution of the Azores plateau, and thus tend to treat each process as acting stand \n\nalone. \n\nTwo types of interpretative models have been presented: those which are based on \n\nconstraints provided by kinematic models thus providing plate tectonic reconstructions \n\nof the previous geometries of the triple junction (Krause and Watkins, 1970;  \n\nMcKenzie, 1972; Searle, 1980; Luis et al., 1994) and those that address particular \n\naspects of the Azores tectonics, based on morpho-tectonic analysis (Machado et al., \n\n1957; Madeira and Ribeiro, 1990; Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998; Vogt and Jung, 2003), isotopic \n\ndating (F\u00e9raud, 1980), focal mechanisms and earthquake epicenter distributions \n\n(Miranda et al., 1998) and GPS observations (Fernandes et al., 2004, 2006). Analyses of \n\nthe present-day context of the ATJ will be dealt with later on. \n\nHere, we present a summary of presented models which are sustained by kinematic \n\ninterpretations; we test their underlying assumptions in respect of available geo-\n\n 11 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \ninformation. Kinematic models are also confronted with models for the evolution of the \n\nAHS, notably those of Cannat et al., (1999) and Gente et al., (2003) to try to identify the \n\nstrong links and/or contradictions between both geodynamic histories across time. \n\nII.2 ATJ Models based on plate kinematic reconstructions \n\nII.2.1 The ATJ prior to 20 Ma: from Kings through to Gloria Fault \n\nRegional studies comprising the kinematic evolution of the Atlantic basin, namely the \n\nevolution of the Gloria fault, always met problems when incorporating the complex \n\nbehaviour of the Iberian microplate, described at times as attached to the Eurasian plate, \n\nor others attached to the African plate (Bonnin, 1978, Olivet, 1984; Klitgord and \n\nSchouten, 1986). Some models also consider that during different time intervals, Iberia \n\nhas moved independently from the two larger plates (Galdeano et al., 1989, Srivastava \n\net al., 1990a, 1990b and Roest and Srivastava, 1991).  \n\nThe analysis of the kinematic behaviour of the Iberian micro-plate is limited by the lack \n\nof prevalent magnetic lineations, and the difficulties in tracing the homologues of \n\nFracture Zone\u2019s traces between the North American Plate (NAM) and Iberian (Canpam, \n\n1995). A thorough analysis of the evolution of the Iberian micro-plate during the \n\nopening of the Northern Atlantic basin is out of scope of this work. \n\nHere we consider just a short summary of the main kinematic events and onset of \n\nresulting morpho-tectonic features during the course of this evolution since anomaly \n\nM0, as proposed by Srivastava et al. (1990a) and depicted in Figure II.1. \n\nAfter mid-Cretaceous (since anomaly M0, 118 Ma), a triple junction developed at the \n\nGulf of Biscay while Iberia is supposed to have shared a common kinematic history \n\nwith Africa. This Triple junction will constitute the main plate boundary during most of \n\n 12 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nthe Atlantic evolution and its trace is defined along the Gulf of Biscay towards a region \n\nnorth of the Kings trough. Its behaviour is mainly extensional between anomalies 33 \n\nand 31, and becomes dominantly right lateral strike slip until anomaly 21 times.  \n\nThe unstable configuration of the triple junction led to its southward migration and the \n\nopening of the Kings trough at anomaly 17 times (ca. 37 Ma). The plate boundary then \n\nbecomes defined by the Kings Trough, Azores-Biscay ridge and the Pyrenees chain. \n\nAfter anomaly 19 (41.4 Ma) Iberia detached progressively from the African plate, with \n\nthe development of a southern Iberian plate boundary defined by the Gloria fault. The \n\nnorthern boundary gradually losses significance and differential motion between \n\nEurasia and Iberia plate nearly cease at anomaly 10.   \n\nAt anomaly 6c (23.4 Ma) activity on the Kings trough ceases completely and Iberia \n\nbecomes attached to the Eurasian plate. Only one triple junction becomes active at the \n\nAzores level and the plate boundary is solely located along the Gloria fault.   \n\nThis model is disputed as it presents several inconsistencies with inland geology, \n\nnamely with regard to the Pyrenees tectonic history, where major wrench events are \n\ndocumented prior to 37.5 Ma. Other difficulties result from the assumption of coupled \n\nmovement between Iberia and Northern Africa as both Atlas, the Rif and the Betics \n\nwere onset prior to anomaly 17 (Canpam, 1995 and references therein).  \n\n 13 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.1 - Evolution of the Iberian Microplate since anomaly M25 to anomaly C6. Note the \ndefinition according to this model of an independent Iberia since anomaly 19 (41.4 Ma) and the \ndefinition of two triple junctions, one at the north in Kings trough and the southern one defined at \nthe Gloria fault. (Srivastava et al., 1990a). \n\n \n\n 14 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nOther authors simplify this history and only consider one triple junction active at each \n\ntime thus precluding an independent Iberia.  The transfer of Iberia Lithosphere from \n\nAfrican plate to the Eurasian plate is signed at anomaly 13 (33.4 Ma) by Ollivet (1984),  \n\nduring anomaly 10 (28.3 Ma) by Klitgord and Schouten (1986) or at 25 Ma following \n\ncollision between EU and AF in southern Iberia (Silver et al., 1998). \n\nAs we shall see below, regardless of the preferred model, when one considers plate \n\nreconstructions confined to a more local scale (the scale of the Azores) it will cause \n\nsignificant difficulties and caveats. Moreover, the Azores block presents the same \n\ndegree of obscurity in kinematic terms as the Iberian plate. Its evolution seems to have \n\nbeen marked by transference from African to Eurasian megaplates behaving sometimes \n\nas an independent block. Understanding the behaviour of its northern (Terceira axis) \n\nand southern (EAFZ) limits is therefore crucial for tracing its evolution. Below, we \n\nreview critically the attempts performed by different authors to constrain it \n\nII.2.2 The ATJ prior to 20 Ma: from Gloria fault to Terceira axis or to EAFZ? \n\nEarly studies, centred on the characterization of the Azores Triple Junction and the EU-\n\nAF plate boundary, were based on sparse ship-borne bathymetric and magnetic profiles. \n\nCalculated global or regional Euler poles suffered from similar limitations. \n\nA first attempt was made by Krause and Watkins (1970) based on the first surface \n\nmagnetic compilation. They considered a RRR (Ridge-Ridge-Ridge) triple junction \n\ntype, with oblique spreading on the Eurasia-African plate boundary. According to these \n\nauthors, such a configuration would have evolved from a RFF triple junction with \n\nmigration of the MAR westwards, south of the EAFZ and change in the spreading \n\ndirection from E-W to ESE-WNW. This re-orientation of the spreading direction would \n\n 15 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \nadditionally result in the creation of a Leaky transform in the ATJ third arm, which \n\nwould ultimately facilitate the formation of the Terceira axis as a secondary spreading \n\ncenter. These authors make no assumptions regarding the stability of the proposed \n\nconfiguration but attribute an age of at least 45 Ma for the beginning of the Terceira axis \n\nleaky transform (Figure II.2).    \n\nMcKenzie (1972) reviewed critically this first model and discussed for the first time the \n\nstability of the ATJ. His model is very similar to that of Krause and Watkins as it \n\nconsiders an evolution of the ATJ from an initial RFF configuration originated at the \n\njunction of the MAR with the EAFZ. Northward migration along the MAR of this triple \n\njunction would result in the formation of two oblique spreading centers and a RRR type \n\ntriple junction (Figure II.3a). He considered that the Triple Junction is stable through \n\ntime provided that all three branches would spread obliquely. Contrary to the previous \n\none, this model precludes change in the spreading direction but as noted by McKenzie \n\n(1972), it would imply a tendency for the ATJ to migrate northward.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.2 \u2013 Sketch depicting the evolution of the Azores Triple Junction proposed by Krause and \nWatkins (1970). Arrows indicate plate spreading directions. \n\n 16 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nBoth models imply the existence of a triangular domain of Azores topography with apex \n\non the triple Junction, bisected by the Terceira axis. The present knowledge of the \n\nAzores plateau as we shall discuss in up-coming sections, its morpho-structural and the \n\nmagnetic anomalies patterns and the kinematic conditions which subsisted through time \n\nallow us to refute this models as un-realistic \n\n \n\nFigure II.3 - Evolution of the Azores Triple Junction according to: a) Mckenzie (1972). b) Searle \n(1980), pattern expresses lithosphere sections transferred from the Eurasian to the African plate \ndue to onset of the Terceira axis (From Searle, 1980). \n\n \n\nThe first strongly documented work on the Azores was produced by Searle (1980), \n\nusing ship-borne magnetic and Gloria lateral sonar mosaics. Searle re-evaluated the \n\nprevious interpretations and defined a first overall segmentation pattern in the Terceira \n\naxis. In his interpretation (Figure II.3b), the Azores Triple Junction evolves, again from \n\nthe EAFZ intersection with the MAR, as a RFF (Ridge-Fault-Fault) configuration, to a \n\nposition defined at the intersection between the Terceira axis and the MAR at the North \n\nAzores Fracture Zone, due to a sudden northward jump of the triple junction. A \n\n 17 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \ntriangular section of previous Eurasian generated lithosphere would than be truncated \n\nby Terceira axis generation and transferred to the African plate.. \n\nSearle (1980) was however renitent in assuming the present ATJ position on the NAFZ, \n\non grounds of the orientation of this Fracture zone with respect to predicted directions \n\nof opening between Eurasian and African plates (closer to ca. N58\u00ba), and does not \n\nexclude, considering the tectonic fabric interpreted from the sonar images and the recent \n\nvolcanic activity, that the Triple Junction could be located further south around 38\u00ba 40\u2019 \n\nN in the region west of Faial. He further considered the Terceira axis as a spreading \n\ncenter but does not exclude the possibility, given the numerous linear ridges running \n\nsub-parallel to the Terceira axis, that true seafloor spreading generating Azores crust \n\ncould be limited and the Azores would therefore represent a rift zone with a high \n\ncomplex architecture resulting from a m\u00e9lange of crust generated previously at the \n\nMAR predated by Azores generated crust possibly along pre-existing tectonic \n\nstructures.  \n\nFinally, an assumption is made by this author concerning the age of the Triple junction \n\nmigration and beginning of the Terceira axis. By extrapolating the calculated spreading \n\nof ca 3 mmyr-1 to the width of the spreading center (along the spreading direction), he \n\nreaches an age of 55 Myr as an upper bound, although he assumes 36 Myr as more \n\nrealistic age for the generation of the Terceira axis, as a result of changes between the \n\nAfrican and Eurasian plates relative movement (Figure II.4).  \n\nII.2.3 The ATJ in the last 10 Ma: fine scale evolution of Triple Junction \n\nLu\u00eds et al. (1994) and Luis (1996) presented a new Azores plateau aeromagnetic chart \n\nwith  a  much  higher  level  of  definition  than previous ones (cf. Figure II.5).

It revealed the recent evolution of the segmentation \n\npattern of the MAR and in particular several northward migrations of the Eurasia-\n\nAfrican-North America triple junction, from a past location near 37\u00b0 N up to its present \n\nlocation interpreted to lay on Pico-Faial alignment with the Mid-Atlantic ridge. Their \n\nproposed evolution comprises: from Chron 5 to Chron 3 (~10-3.85 Ma) existence of an \n\nindependently moving Azores block detached from both Eurasian and African plate. \n\n 19 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \nDuring this time span two triple junctions were active at the northern and southern \n\nboundaries of the block. They could only constrain the position of the southern one \n\ninitially at 38\u00ba00\u2019N, 38\u00ba50\u2019W and gradually jumping north to 38\u00ba20\u2019N, 30\u00ba15\u2019 W \n\nbetween C4 and C3A.  At C2A (2.45 Ma), ATJ reaches its present position at 38\u00ba55\u2019N, \n\n30\u00ba00\u2019W. From that time on, they consider that the Azores block moves attached to the \n\nEurasian plate.  \n\nThis analysis was however based on plate tectonic reconstructions with regards to the \n\nMAR, and little can be inferred about the tectonic implications of their proposed ATJ \n\nevolution within the plateau. For example, the northward migration of the southern ATJ \n\nimplicitly implies that some amount of internal deformation should exist within the \n\nAzores block, and also that sections of Azores block lithosphere have possibly been \n\ntransferred to the African plate, as also suggested by Searle (1980). Lack of constraints \n\non the kinematic behavior and position of the northern ATJ from the past until anomaly \n\n2A, limits the ability to understand the Azores Plateau evolution through time. \n\nII.3 Testing two kinematic models for the evolution of the ATJ  \n\nTriple junctions are intrinsically unstable features (Cronin, 1992) and several authors \n\n(e.g. Bird et al., 1998 and 1999; Rusby and Searle, 1995; Mitchell and Livermore, 1998) \n\nhave suggested that the approach to be followed when performing plate tectonic \n\nreconstructions in these domains should account for tectonic explanations rather than \n\nperforming strict kinematic reconstructions. The problem of using a purely kinematic \n\napproach has been addressed by Cox and Heart (1986) as \u201cThe three plate problem\u201d, \n\nwhere in a triple junction defined by three plates A, B and C, if one rotates plates A and \n\nB relative to the C, about fixed Euler poles than relative movement between plates A \n\nand B cannot be described by a fixed Euler pole through time.  \n\n 20 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.5 - Schematic model of the Azores Triple Junction according to Luis et al., (1994) from \nanomaly 5 to the present.

The EU/AF (or EU/NUB) plate boundary, with some exceptions around Terceira \n\naxis, does not provide a coherent pattern of seafloor magnetic anomalies, thus not \n\nproviding consistent isochrones for plate tectonic reconstructions; \n\n 21 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \n2. There are no clear transform faults across the Azores plateau that can provide plate \n\nspreading direction constraints through time. \n\nHere, we use the isochrons from Luis et al. (1996) and Canpam (1995) to check the \n\nconsistency of plate reconstructions and the validity of kinematic models presented in \n\nsection II.2.2. We consider specifically their underlying hypothesis that Pico is the N. \n\nAmerican plate structural analogue of the EAFZ, which, as presented previously, is \n\ngenerally assumed as the plate boundary between EU and AF from times prior to at \n\nleast anomaly 6 in those models. \n\nAnomaly picks from these authors complement each other. Canpam (1995) picked \n\nanomalies covering a wider region from the Northern and Central Atlantic, whereas \n\nLuis et al., (1994) and Luis (1996) chrons were retrieved from a denser aero-magnetic \n\nmap centred on the Azores region and therefore allowing a more detailed analysis of \n\nthis region. Magnetic anomalies selected for this approach are C13 (33.4 Ma), C6 (20.1 \n\nMa), C5 (9.8 Ma) on all three plates. The magnetic time scale is from Cande and Kent \n\n(1995). Their anomalies are displayed in Figure II.6.   \n\nThe figure reveals that magnetic anomaly picks display a rather close pattern with the \n\nexception of anomaly C13. Due to higher resolution of the aero-magnetic chart in the \n\nAzores area, Luis was able to trace within the plateau, a trail of points for anomalies C5 \n\nand C6. Canpam does not consider any anomalies within the plateau and only traces \n\nthem to the intersection with the Terceira axis to the north and with the EAFZ to the \n\nsouth. The definition of anomalies south of the Pico F.Z and in the African plate is \n\nsparse due to very poor quality of existing magnetic data and the fit between both \n\nauthors is poor probably due to the magnetic time scale choosen. \n\n 22 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\n 23 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.6 - Magnetic anomaly map of Luis et al.

Finite rotation poles between \n\nAfrican (AF) and Eurasia (EU) can therefore be calculated by: \n\nAFROT EU (t) = AFROTNA(t)+NAROTEU(t)       (II.1) \n\nWhere AROTB(t) is the rotational parameters (latitude, longitude and angle) of the finite \n\nrotation of plate A relative to plate B for a given time (t). \n\nStage poles (describing plates relative movement between time intervals), can, on the \n\nother hand, be calculated by finite rotations as below. \n\nEUROTAF (C6-0) + EUROTAFR(0-C5) =EUROTAF(C6-C5)    (II.2) \n\nStage poles are here used to provide an assessment of the tectonic regimes acting on the \n\nAzores plateau during discrete time intervals. This is achieved by rotating a set of \n\nelements from their expected initial locations at the oldest time considered and trace \n\ntheir circuit from that initial time to the present. One should bear in mind that the vector \n\nfor each time interval only provides an integral measurement of the total displacement \n\nand not the incremental path within the time interval under consideration.  \n\nTo perform this analysis we calculated the stage poles using equations (1) and (2) for set \n\nof poles 1 and we also used stage poles calculated by Canpam (1995) from her finite \n\nrotations poles.

Rotations are performed assuming points belong to Eurasian plate at the time of \n\nanomaly C13 and considering a fixed African plate. Their circuit comprises therefore \n\nthree stages from C13 to C6 (20 Ma), from C6 to C5 (10 Ma), and from C5 to the \n\npresent. \n\nWe verify that, regardless of the poles series chosen, the bulk tectonic regime during the \n\ngrowth and evolution of the Azores was transtensional with a variable component of \n\nright lateral shear. The initial rotation between C13 and C6 is characterized by a \n\ntranstensional regime dominated by extension in a N10\u00ba to a N13\u00ba direction between AF \n\nand EU plates. In this instance, rotations with the two pole series differ drastically in \n\nspreading velocities.  \n\nThe spreading directions between both time series vary more significantly between C6 \n\nand C0. During this time span both are characterized by an increase in the lateral shear \n\ncomponent of transtension. In Pole series 1, the bulk extensional direction changes to \n\n 26 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \napproximately SW-NE between C6 and C5, and then to WSW-ENE from C5 to the \n\npresent. These later spreading directions are very similar to that retrievable form \n\nNUVEL1A for AF/EU, which vary between N65\u00ba to N70\u00ba from West to East across the \n\nplateau (DeMets et al., 1994). Pole series 2 rotates from WSW-ENE to a nearly E-W \n\nspreading direction therefore suggesting a more oblique spreading with respect to the \n\nstrike of the main plateau morphological features. The spreading direction predicted by \n\nthe stage poles series 2 between C5 and C0 is very similar to the present day spreading \n\ndirection retrieved from global and regional geodetic models based solely on GPS \n\nobservations like the Revel2000 (Sella et al., 2002) and Deos2K (Fernandes et al., 2006, \n\nsee also chapter IV).  \n\nConsidering the orientation of small wavelength relief generation like the linear \n\nvolcanic ridges and assuming that they were formed in a context of pure traction, then \n\nthe possible timings for their generation can be constrained by kinematic scenarios \n\noutlined in Figure II.7 and Table II.3.  \n\nFrom C13 and C6, considering Pole Series 1, the optimally oriented structures for pure \n\nshear extension within the Azores domain are the EAFZ and some significant linear \n\nfeatures such as the linear volcanic ridge trending E-W between 25\u00ba30\u2019W and 26\u00ba30\u2019W \n\nat the latitude of Terceira Island and the E-W elongated plateau which culminates in the \n\nS. Miguel Island (Figure II.7). The orientation of these structures supports the \n\nconsideration that their growth is controlled by pr\u00e9-existing FZ (Guest et al., 1999). \n\nTheir favorable orientation with respect to direction of extension during that time span, \n\ncould have promoted FZ reactivation and extension.  Other  E-W  south  facing \n\nmorphological steps between flat horizontal, probably highly sedimented terraces at ca. \n\n38\u00baN between 26\u00baW and 27\u00ba30\u2019W, might have been favored in the same time interval. \n\n 27 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.7 - Rotation of point elements using stage poles calculated in Table II.2.

Stage poles from \n\nboth time series and corresponding extension directions favor their generation at a time \n\nyounger than 20 Ma.  \n\nThe linear volcanic ridges in the plateau western sector (corresponding to the Central \n\ngroup Islands of Pico-Faial and S. Jorge), considering their orientations, may again \n\nresult from reactivation of some Fracture Zone sections, their growth as magmatic \n\nsystems is favoured between anomaly 6 and 5, taking Poles Series 1 or in right lateral \n\ntranstensional considering Poles series 2.  As we shall see later on (in chapter VII), to \n\nsome extent, magmatic growth of these structures can be considered irrespective of far-\n\nfield stresses, and more conditioned by local circumstances such as internal magma \n\npressure, and magma migration mechanisms. \n\nII.3.2 Is the Pico FZ the structural homologue of the EAFZ?  \n\nThe approach from previous section does not allow constraining the position of the ATJ \n\nfor a given time, as the chosen points used for rotation with the stage poles have \n\narbitrary positions with respect to the plate boundary for that time. They only provide a \n\nmeasure of expectable plate boundary tectonic behavior. To constraint the position of \n\nthe ATJ at specific time intervals, we performed finite rotations between morpho-\n\ntectonic elements and isochrones using the two poles series presented in table II.1. Plate \n\ntectonic reconstructions were performed aiming at verification of the hypothesis that \n\nPico and EAFZ are structurally homologue structures.  \n\n 30 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n If one considers that the ATJ was located at the EAFZ-Pico FZ at the times C13 (33 \n\nMa) and C6 (20 Ma), and that depart of the ATJ from this position has started in a \n\nyounger age, than the finite rotation of the points marking the intersection of each chron \n\nwith the Pico F.Z from the American plate with NAM-EU and NAM-AF finite poles \n\nshould plot over the position (in present coordinates) of the EAFZ. The results of this \n\napproach are presented in Figures II.8 and II.9. \n\nThese reveal a large misfit and a poor closure of the ATJ at each time interval \n\nconsidered. For example at C13 time (33.4 Ma), the misfit in the position between \n\nstable EU/NAM and stable AF/NAM finite rotations of the equivalent point in the N. \n\nAmerican Plate is of ca. 87 km using poles from series 1. Considering poles from series \n\n2 the misfit is larger, ca. 146 km. Even if we consider the mismatch in the overlap \n\nbetween Canpam magnetic anomaly picks of C13NAM with respect to C13EU after \n\nfinite rotation (about 73 km), the resulting misfit in Pico F.Z with respect to EAFZ \n\nwould still be in the order of 73 km.  \n\nThese misfits between the Pico FZ and the EAFZ in present day coordinates observed in \n\nboth Figures II.8 and II.9, regardless of the kinematic model chosen as a reference; \n\nimply that, no simple kinematic closure of the three plates at the ATJ can be achieved.  \n\nPoles in series 1 and 2, perform relatively well in fitting the Pico FZ to the EAFZ after \n\nrotation, when using NAM/AF poles. Therefore, EAFZ migth have acted as a plate \n\nboundary fault between the northern limit of stable AF and the Azores domain. We shall \n\nrefer to this limit from now on as the SATJ (Southern Azores Triple Junction). \n\n \n\n 31 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure II.8 - Schematic representation of Pico Fz rotations using Pole series 1 as kinematical \nconstraint.

When considering the width of the Fracture Zone, we verify that in \n\nits eastern section, between 26\u00ba42\u2019W and 27\u00ba54\u2019W, the fracture zone valley is wider \n\n(~16 km) than its western section were the valley is well marked by a narrow PTDZ of \n\nca. 8 km. So, considering the values presented in Table II.3, probably the older sections \n\nof the EAFZ have been subject to a greater amount of extension, but the bulk of the C13 \n\nto C6 extension had also to be partitioned in other plate boundary structures located \n\nnorthwards. \n\n \n\nFigure II.10 - Topographical profiles across the EAFZ Note the progressive widening of the \ntransform valley from the central to the eastern topographical profile. In the western profile, the \ntransform valley dies out and only a major south facing scarp is present. \n\n 33 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \nThe transition between these two EAFZ domains is set at -27\u00ba54\u2019W (Figure II.11). This \n\nlocation marks the beginning of a NW trending valley that roots into the EAFZ. and \n\nthen inflects to a more WNW-ESE direction, terminating in wedge shape depression \n\nwhich cuts through Faial ridge, south of the condor Bank and defines the Princess Alice \n\nbank to the South.  \n\nThis structure has been interpreted by Vogt and Jung (2003) as the morphological trace \n\nof the SATJ northward migration as a failed rift. Therefore, narrowness of the EAFZ \n\nwest of this point, might represent the last increments of this structure as a major plate \n\nboundary fault. The lithosphere section imprisoned between this structure and the \n\ntermination of the EAFZ trace might correspond to Azores lithosphere accreted onto the \n\nAF plate. \n\n \n\nFigure II.11 - Shaded relief perspective view (facing NNW) of the EAFZ termination. Transparent \npolygon indicates possible Azores lithosphere accreted onto the AF plate located southwards. Doted \nline expresses possible SATJ migration path. PAB is Princess Alice Bank. See text for explanation.  \n\n \n\n 34 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nFollowing an analogue procedure, we constrained the northern plate boundary between \n\na stable Eurasian plate and the Azores domain by rotation of Pico FZ about NAM/EU \n\nfinite Euler poles. Upon rotation, its position is to northerly with respect to the EAFZ. \n\nAt C13, it lies in a point at the junction between the N-S striking Monaco Bank and the \n\nWestern tip of S. Miguel Island. At C6, it lies in a point ca. 38\u00ba N 27\u00ba W, which pins a \n\nclear change in attitude of magnetic anomaly C6 from NNW-SSE to NNE-SSW as \n\npicked by Luis et al. (Figure II.6).  \n\nBy analogy to the SATJ, the trace of rotated Pico using NAM-EU finite rotation poles \n\ntying this points is considered here as representative of the southern border of a \n\nkinematically stable Eurasian plate, and will be referred to as the NATJ \u2013 (Northern \n\nAzores Triple Junction). \n\nThe southern limit of a stable Eurasian plate, lying south of the Terceira axis, given the \n\npositions of rotated elements referred to above, cannot be linked to any clear first order \n\nmorpho-tectonic signature in present day topography within the Azores plateau. This \n\nhas two implications: either the present day topography was shaped more recently, \n\npossibly as a result of masking effects due to later tectono-magmatic events, or the \n\nNATJ was never a discrete feature during the all time span, but rather corresponded to a \n\nzone of distributed deformation. \n\nThe broad lens resulting from the mismatches in the ATJ closure (cf. Figure II.8 and \n\nII.9) provides an integral measure of Azores deformation during the ATJ evolution from \n\n33.4 Ma to the onset of the SATJ migration, and leads to the hypothesis that an Azores \n\ndomain, with a kinematic behavior independent of the two neighboring larger plates, has \n\nsubsisted at least from anomaly 13 to anomaly 5 when EAFZ ceases its activity. \n\n 35 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \nMoreover, as at C13 no ATJ closure can be achieved, right lateral transtension within \n\nthis plate boundary surely started prior to this age. \n\nIt remains unclear if the response to this deformation in the EU/AF plate boundary was \n\naccommodated solely at the Mid-Atlantic ridge, for example by the re-arrangement of \n\nthe segmentation pattern, with possible growth of segments, by re-orientation of \n\nexisting ones and break-up of new non-transform discontinuities of higher orders, which \n\nwould ultimately lead to geometrical repositioning of the MAR axis. If this has been the \n\ncase, then the independent Azores domain grew solely from ridge dynamics and \n\ntherefore some equivalent offaxis signature should be traceable in the North American \n\nplate. Lack of definition in existing data does not allow at present the verification of this \n\nhypothesis.  \n\nAnother possibility can be considered: if Azores domain generation has resulted from \n\ntectonic-magmatic processes at the EU/AF plate boundary itself in the MAR off-axis \n\ndomain. This could be achieved, for instance as re-activation of fracture zones as leaky \n\nstructures or as formation of new fault zones within the active plate boundary domain. \n\nIn this case, instability and northward migration of both Azores domain northern and \n\nsouthern limits would result from an intra-transform context, such as in some pacific \n\nmicro-plates like Easter, Galapagos and Juan Fernandez (Bird et al.,1998; Bird et al., \n\n1999; Naar and Hey, 1991),  as a tectonic response to ruling kinematics conditions for \n\neach time interval. The morphological evidences for the SATJ migration from the \n\nEAFZ, favor this second hypothesis; even so, some of the SATJ and NATJ dynamics \n\nthrough time can be accounted from magmatic pulses resulting from AHS activity as we \n\nshall refer to below in section II.4.  \n\n 36 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nII.4 The Azores Hotspot \n\nIn the previous section, we considered the behavior of the ATJ along the time. We shall \n\nnow consider the different models describing the nature and dynamics of the AHS and \n\nlater we will address how they do mutually fit in. \n\nIn a time where there is a ongoing strong scientific community debate for or against \n\nmantle plume dynamics, relevance of mantle convection vs. plate tectonic controls, \n\npossible degrees of interaction with overlaying tectonic plates and even if plumes do \n\nexist at all (see for details www.mantleplumes.org), it is relevant to recall that the AHS \n\nremains a controversial topic in scientific literature.  \n\nThe nature and dynamics of this mantle surge and the variations of the magma flux to \n\nthe plateau is of key importance to understand the Azores geodynamic evolution and to \n\nconstrain issues such as:  1) existence and style of hot spot trace paths across the \n\nplateau; 2) present day position and area extent of the AHS; 3) Spatial-temporal \n\ndistribution of magma generation and constraints on the age of the plateau, its inner \n\nstructures and the Azores Archipelago Islands; 4) degree of interaction with the Azores \n\nTriple Junction evolution through time, and therefore 5) relation with past and present \n\nplate boundary configuration between Eurasian and Nubian plates, current location and \n\ntectonic style of the Azores Triple Junction. Many of these points remain controversial \n\nor unanswered, even between those who share favorable views on the Azores mantle \n\nplume existence.  \n\nOne point which remains nevertheless undisputed: the Azores volcanic platform results \n\nfrom an excess in volcanism/magmatism. Accordingly, the crustal structure of the \n\nAzores is equally anomalous (Escartin et al., 2001; Searle, 1976; Miranda et al., 1998; \n\n 37 \n\nhttp://www.mantleplumes.org/\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \nMatias, in press). Only the sub-lithospheric causes of this magmatic excess remain \n\ncontroversial.  \n\nNumerous observations show evidence of an interaction between hot spots and Mid-\n\nocean ridges at various levels: a thermal interaction, resulting in more crust being \n\ngenerated near hot spots, a geochemical interaction, implying a mixture of depleted \n\nmantle sources feeding the mid-ocean ridges and enriched mantle sources of the hot \n\nspot, and finally a dynamic interaction, responsible for the migration of second-order \n\nsegments away from the hot spots, and of an asymmetry of the accretion processes \n\n(M\u00fcller, 1998; Hardarson et al., 1997, Small, 1995). Frequent observations of spreading \n\nasymmetry and ridge jumps in sections of mid-ocean ridges close to hot spots suggest \n\nthat mantle flow from the hot spot may control the distribution of stresses in the \n\nlithosphere above it (Ito et al., 2003; Mittelstaedt and Ito, 2005)  \n\nFor the Azores case, available publications tend to address the evolution of the AHS and \n\nATJ as two independent realities, and little effort is made in the integration of their \n\ncommon history. Yet, it is recognized unequivocally by the generality of the authors, \n\nthat both have interacted strongly at least from the past 20 Ma. \n\nII.4.1 Nature of the Azores Hot-Spot (AHS) \n\nThe AHS has been interpreted in a diverse number of ways. The plateau bathymetric \n\nanomaly is attributed as te outcome of activity from: a plume detached head (Silveira \n\nand Stutzmann, 2002 and Silveira et al., 2006; Courtillot et al., 2003) a plume deeply \n\nrooted in the lower mantle (Montelli et al., 2004) or with minor geochemical \n\ncontributions from it (Madureira et al., 2005);  as a classical Hawain type hot-spot \n\n(Gente et al, 2003), a wet spot (Schiling et al., 1975; Bonnati et al, 1990), an un-\n\n 38 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nspecified mantle anomaly (Mitchell et al., 2004);  a plume related thermal/melt anomaly \n\n(Escartin et al., 2001, Cannat et al., 1999), or finally refuted as a plume related \n\ntopographical expression (Anderson, 2001;  Luis and Neves, 2006;  Favela and \n\nAnderson, 2000). \n\nThese discrepancies illustrate well the lack of scientific consensus with regard to this \n\nregion and the meaning of the processes which have acted upon it. One of the main \n\narguments favoring the AHS is its influence on the MAR, an effect which has been \n\nrelatively well studied (Schilling, 1985; Detrick et al., 1995; Bourdon et al., 1996; \n\nCannat et al., 1999; Escartin et al., 2001). The AHS- MAR interaction is expressed by \n\nan asymmetrical bathymetric anomaly along axis extending from Kurtchakov FZ at 41\u00ba \n\nN at least to the Hayes Fracture Zone (at ~33.5\u00baN) (Goslin et al., 1999), but it is \n\narguable that it extends further south to the Kanes F. Z. (at 24\u00baN) (Escartin et al., \n\n(2001). the MAR mid-valley is shallowest within the Azores. This bathymetry long \n\nwave-length variation is consistent with other gradients such as gravity anomalies \n\n(Detrick et al., 1995, Luis et al., 1998) and geochemical anomalies documented on \n\nbasalts both in the axial domain (Dosso et al., 1999, White et al., 1976) and in the off-\n\naxis domain (Bougault et al., 1985).  \n\nAll these long wavelength variations suggest either that the mantle is anomalously hot \n\nand/or enriched (Cannat et al., 1999). Modeling of the effect of hot-spots on ridge \n\nbathymetry and melt production is primarily a function of the plume flux (itself a \n\nfunction of temperature and size of the plume head), mantle viscosity, spreading rate \n\nand absolute motion of the ridge with respect to the plume (Escartin et al, 2001), \n\nconsidering the Azores context, Ito and Lin, (1995) calculated values of approximately \n\n70\u00ba C for temperature anomalies related with the Azores plume.  \n\n 39 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \nOther contradictory views were presented by Bonatti (1990) based on the application of \n\ngeothermometers on peridotite and basaltic material. Based on the high volatiles content \n\nfor samples collected in the Azores region which reach two to three times normal \n\nMORB, he considered that this would have a significant impact in lowering the mantle \n\nsolidus temperature curve therefore promoting high degrees of partial melting without \n\nthe existence of a significant mantle temperature anomaly in the Azores.  \n\nGravimetric modelling of the plateau (Luis et al., 1998) and recent application of \n\nregional 3D admittance studies in the spectral domain (Luis and Neves, 2006) suggest \n\nthat the plateau is regionally compensated and its shallow topography is supported by \n\nregional lithospheric flexure.  These authors rule out the role dynamic forces maintained \n\nby mantle upwelling as the cause for the bathymetric surge.  \n\nII.4.2 Spatial location of the hot spot \n\nThere are no consensus on the areal extent and present location of the AHS nowadays.  \n\nTomographic models have been used to constrain the AHS position. Zhang and \n\nTanimoto, (1992) report anomalously low S-wave velocities marking the hot spot \n\ninfluence in a large area, slightly east of the MAR. Silveira and Stuztmann, (2002) \n\npresented a first regional tomographic model with anisotropy retrieved from surface \n\nwave velocities. Their model reveals that the Azores related SV velocity anomaly fades \n\nat a depth of 150 km and is not linked with any deeply rooted structure (Figure II.12). \n\nYang et al. (2006), using P wave tomography, also documented a generalized low \n\nvelocity anomaly at a depth of ~100 km underneath the Azores. At higher depths (100-\n\n200 km) this anomaly becomes elongated along the NE-SW direction and at depths \n\nfrom 250 km to 400 km they position the anomaly related with the AHS in a pipe like \n\nstructure NE of Terceira. \n\n 40 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nOther authors consider a location for the AHS 100 to 200 km to the east of the ridge in \n\nthe Island of Faial (Schiling, 1991, Ito and Lin, 1995, Silver et al.,1998) or nearby \n\nTerceira Island (Moreira et al., 1999; Madureira et al., 2005), consistently the shallower \n\nand more volcanically focused domain within the Azores plateau.  Escartin et al. (2001) \n\nplaces the AHS some 300 km east of the Princesa Alice in the vicinities of the S. Miguel \n\nIsland, based on extrapolation of the HS2 model to times older than 3.2 Ma. Given this \n\ndisparities we conclude that the current position and the lateral extent of the AHS plume \n\nhead are not coherently described by the different aproaches and remain still uncertain. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.12 - Cross-section of the S-wave velocity perturbation along the longitude 24\u00baW passing \nthrough the Azores (Silveira and Sutzmann, 2002). Note that the velocity anomaly fades at a depth \nof 150 km. \n\n \n\nII.4.3 Dynamics of the Azores Hot Spot \n\nPlume dynamics over time has always been constrained in a context of its interaction \n\nwith the MAR and situated spatial-temporally within the kinematic framework given by \n\n 41 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \nseafloor spreading on this ridge system. It\u2019s interaction with the ATJ third branch over \n\ntime has always been subdued probably due to inherent complexities of this plate \n\nboundary. Below, we describe two contradictory models of interaction between the \n\nAHS and the MAR overtime: \n\nThe interaction between the hot spot and the Mid-Atlantic ridge appears to be \n\nresponsible for a major thermal or magmatic event under the Mid-Atlantic Ridge 10 Ma \n\nago, leading to the formation of part of the Azores Plateau, and an increase of crustal \n\nthickness between 5 and 8 km (Cannat et al., 1999; Escartin et al., 2001). This thermal \n\nanomaly has propagated southward along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis. Following a \n\ndecrease in crustal production at the MAR since 5 Ma, the volcanic plateau was split \n\ninto two branches, diachronically, forming the V-shaped structure marking the south of \n\nthe present Azores plateau (Figure I.1). The decrease in crustal production at the MAR \n\nmay have resulted from a reduction in the hot spot activity, or from a change in the \n\ndynamics of the interaction between the MAR and the hot spot.  \n\nNo other event of this type has been recognized yet, in particular no other V-shaped \n\nvolcanic ridge is observed within, or outside the main one. This model assumes that the \n\nAHS was centered along the ridge axis at the time of Chron 5, which corresponded at \n\nthat time to the SATJ defined at the intersection between EAFZ, Pico FZ and the MAR \n\nin a RFF configuration. In subsequent times, while the melt anomaly migrated along the \n\nridge axis. The considered fixed plume migrated NE into the Azores Plateau at a rate of \n\n~20 km/Ma, following the southwestward absolute motion of the Ridge and adjoining \n\nplates, considering the HS2 reference frame. Southwestward migration of this thermal \n\nanomaly would have occurred at a rate of 60 km/Ma, according to those authors. \n\n 42 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.13 - Sketches showing the location of selected bathymetry and gravity features from \nanomaly 4 (7.01 Ma) to the present.

They take Canpam (1995), earlier referred in \n\nthis work as the kinematic reference model for their reconstructions. Plate kinematic \n\nreconstructions have revealed some key features and relations between the Azores \n\nplateau, Hot Spot activity and neighbouring structures like the Great Meteor on the \n\nAfrican plate and the Corner Rise in the North American plate. However, as stated by \n\nthe authors:  \n\n 43 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \n\u201cno precise inference should be drawn from our reconstructions on the detailed \n\nevolution of the Azores-Gibraltar line that marks the Africa-Eurasia Plate Boundary\u201d.  \n\nTheir model is sketched in Figure II.13 and can be summarised as follows: The \n\ninteraction between the AHS and the MAR starts at 85 Ma and results in the formation \n\nof the Great Meteor seamounts (in the African Plate) and the Corner Rise in the \n\nAmerican Plate (see Figure I.1 for location). Northeastward migration of this interaction \n\nalong the MAR axis continues until anomaly 6 (20 Ma) resulting in the early stages of \n\nAzores Plateau formation. Between anomalies 6 and 5 (10 Ma) plume influence in \n\ncentred in the Azores plateau and its interaction with the MAR gradually loses \n\nsignificance. At 7 Ma the Azores plateau is fully formed and the melt generation arising \n\nfrom plume activity ceases, this stage marks again the onset of normal seafloor \n\nspreading at the MAR north of latitude 38\u00ba.  In the Southern part of the plateau Rifting \n\nof the Azores plateau started at C3 (4 Ma) and results in the formation of both Flores \n\nand Faial ridges (also referred as West Jussieu and East Jussieu plateaus) as independent \n\nmorpho-tectonic features. The authors assume that the Azores plume is currently \n\ncentred below Terceira Island.  \n\nII.5 Discussion  \n\nII.5.1 Interaction between the Azores Hot Spot and the Azores Triple Junction \n\nConstraints on the formation of the Azores plateau and its inner structure are sometimes \n\nattributed to the kinematic evolution of the ATJ, others to the action of the AHS as we \n\nhave just seen. It seems clear that their concurrence in space and time is bound to have \n\npromoted some degree of interaction between these two main processes.  \n\n 44 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nIf it is clear that the AHS, resulted in the formation of thicker than normal oceanic crust \n\nand the shaping of the anomalously shallow bathymetry; the geometry of the plateau,  \n\nits internal structure, and the northeastern and southeastern limits within the EU/AF \n\nplate boundary (i.e Terceira axis and EAFZ)  are clear tectonic features. This suggests \n\nthat the surface expression of the excess in magmatism is tectonically controlled.  \n\nConsidering both the kinematic constraints of the ATJ and the models for the evolution \n\nof the AHS, it results that the Azores deformation history started prior to any relevant \n\nspatial influence of the AHS trace in this plate boundary domain. The models used in \n\nsection II.2.4 suggest that beginning of transtension started prior to anomaly 13 (i.e 33.4 \n\nMa). According to Gente et al., (2003) the position of the hot spot, considering an \n\nabsolute reference frame, should be to southerly to bear important interactions or \n\nconsequences to the Triple Junction. \n\nThe age of the plateau and intrinsically the age of the Terceira axis are still subject to \n\nconsiderable scatter in estimates. For example Canpam et al. (1995) sets an age for this \n\nfeatures as early as 36 Ma age. Vogt and Jung (2003) have defined 24 Ma as its limiting \n\nage, Searle (1980) considers an estimate of 36 Ma. Given that the bathymetric anomaly \n\ndoes not surpass C6, in the North American Plate it is plausible that the bulk of its \n\nconstruction should have occurred prior to this age. As observed earlier, models \n\nconsidering the AHS evolution also point to an estimate of 20 Ma for the beginning of \n\nthe most important period of AHS-MAR interaction which reaches a maximum at \n\napproximately 10 Ma (C5) and then gradually decreases activity from 7 Ma to the \n\npresent.  \n\n \n\n 45 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.14 - Schematic reconstructions of the relative movement between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge \n(MAR) and a hot spot supposed to be located under the Azores Archipelago and centred under \nTerceira Island.

Z. and J.P. - \nJussieu  Plateau. \n\n 46 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nPresented models in section II.2.3 differ essentially in the proposed mechanisms for the \n\ngeneration of the Faial and Flores ridges and the implications on the AHS dynamic \n\nthrough time. The model proposed by Cannat et al. (1999) considers that the rifting \n\nevent leading to these main morpho-structures is essentially diachronical an directed \n\nsouth westward. Conversely, Gente et al. (2003) considered a more typical hot spot \n\ntrace migrating progressively northward and associate the rifting of this plateau to a \n\nsingle event which started some 7 Ma ago when abnormal hot spot derived excess in \n\nmagmatism ceased. \n\nWhen considering the implications of both models addressing the possible \n\nconsequences to the ATJ of the prevalence of hot spot related activity within the plateau \n\nin time, several limitations arise: \n\nMAR generated magnetic anomalies, namely those that mark the onset of the plateau \n\n(C6 and C5) are still traceable within the plateau, as we have seen in section 1.2.1, and \n\nthese seem inconsistent with widespread hot-spot influence of AHS on the plateau build \n\nup.  To render the hypothesis valid, then the southern termination of anomalies 5 and 6, \n\nas picked by Luis et al. (1994), within the Plateau must be re-examined. \n\nThe magnetic anomalies of the Faial and Flores ridges are broadly positive, which \n\nseems to refute the dyachronical nature of these structures proposed by Cannat et al. \n\n(1999). Moreover from a geometric point of view, it is difficult to justify Cannat \n\nhypothesis that the plume was centred on the Ridge axis and was the key factor in the \n\ngeneration of the plateau. The plateau morphological asymmetry, with respect to the \n\npresent MAR position, cannot be accounted by the referred ridge axis migration.  \n\n 47 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \nThe prolongation westward of the EAFZ transform valley bordering the southern \n\ntermination of the Faial ridge and the Azores plateau as an abrupt morphological step \n\nfacing south is difficult to cope with a northward migration of the AHS, as its \n\ninteraction with the EAFZ should blur its surface expression and not be limited by it. A \n\nmore consistent behavior can be observed in the NAM plate where the Pico FZ \n\nterminates quite abruptly eastwards against the plateau.  \n\nFinally, the morpho-structure of Terceira axis itself, where deep basin occur, does not \n\nseem immediately linkable to a widespread excess in magmatism hot spot, relatable if \n\nthis structure would have defined the northern boundary of the Azores plateau since at \n\nleast anomaly C6 as represented in numerous models namely those of  Gente et al. \n\n(2003) and Cannat et al. (1999). \n\nII.5.2 Onset of SATJ northwards Migration  \n\nConsidering Gente et al. (2003) model as a complete portrait of AHS dynamic through \n\ntime, then what can we anticipate to be the response of the ATJ to the progressing AHS \n\nnorthwards? \n\nProbably a combination of changing kinematic conditions depicted in section II.2 \n\nassociated with the body forces resultant from topography build up, might have induced \n\na tectonic response which resulted in strain re-localization and redefinition of the plate \n\nboundary, as AHS migration would proceed. \n\nAs suggested by Vogt and Jung (2003), the abandonment of the SATJ from the EAFZ \n\nand its progressive migration northward seems to have been crucial to the development \n\nof the Azores plateau internal structure. Vogt and Jung (2003) attribute the generation of \n\nthe LVR, as a succession of failed rifts following this TJ migration, concomitant with \n\n 48 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nthe progressive hot spot track also to the north. As we shall see later (see Chapter V) we \n\nfavor a somewhat different interpretation as we consider that the western linear volcanic \n\nridge domain has at present a significant tectono-magmatic activity and constitutes a \n\npart of inter-plate boundary zone. \n\nTiming the onset of this migration is of key importance for the age relationship of \n\nmorphological features within the plateau.  We interpret the triple junction migration as \n\na process that generated from a intra-transform setting between C6 and C5 and \n\nterminated post east Jussieu plateau formation. The fact that the valley that marks this \n\nmigration cuts through a well shaped terrace and is not in-filled by magmatic products \n\nand the disruption itself of the Faial ridge, suggests, that the overall SATJ migration \n\nmight have occurred in a magma-poor environment therefore at the at the onset of the \n\nMAR normal seafloor spreading, (i.e. ca. 7 Ma according to Gente et al., 2003). \n\nThe gradual migration of the SATJ converges to expectable NATJ position. Probably \n\nthe changing in the kinematic conditions that supported this migration favored the \n\nrupturing of the Terceira axis as an intra-oceanic rift zone, therefore redefining the \n\nNATJ trace and plate boundary to a more northerly position along this structure. \n\nThough the starting age can be tentatively constrained by Gente\u2019s model, the end of \n\nsuch process, which resulted in the present definition of the EU/AF plate boundary \n\ndominantly along the Terceira axis is less easily definable. Probably, Luis et al., 1994 \n\nmodel where the repositioning of the SATJ is achieved by discrete small ridge jumps to \n\nits present position, allegedly along the intersection of Faial-Pico strike with the MAR, \n\nremains valid (also see discussion in Chapter VIII).    \n\nThe disparities observed in some sectors of the Azores plateau between main morpho-\n\ntectonic and magnetic anomaly features suggests that its present morphology and most \n\n 49 \n\n\n\n \nChapter II \u2013Review of the kinematic models for the ATJ and AHS \n \n \nof its magnetic character associated with the Azores trend have been shaped in recent \n\ntimes, surely less than 7 Ma, and most probably less than 3 Ma as we shall see later in \n\nchapters IV and V of this manuscript, when we will analyze in more detail the present \n\nconfiguration of the ATJ and the EU/NUB plate boundary. \n\nII.6 Conclusions \n\n1) The rotations of a set of point elements within the plateau, inferred from calculated \n\nEU/AF stage poles, suggest an overall dominance of a transtensional or oblique \n\nextension regime from at least 33.4 (C13) to the present. From C13 to C6 any of these \n\nregimes would be dominated by extension along a near N-S direction. From C6 to the \n\npresent extensional direction rotates to a direction closer to WSW-ENE or W-E \n\naccording to the reference kinematical model chosen.  \n\n2) The EAFZ can be approached as the structural homologue of the Pico FZ considering \n\nNAM/WAF finite rotation poles. Therefore this structure acted as a southern plate \n\nboundary SATJ for most of the evolution of the Azores plateau since anomaly C13. \n\n3) The northern trace of rotated Pico FZ Position using NAM/EU finite rotation poles \n\n(NATJ), does not correspond to any significant morphological feature. This implies that \n\neither a discrete plate boundary never evolve fully, and that the Azores kinematic block \n\nconstituted an area of essentially distributed deformation, or that if existed this plate \n\nboundary was mask later by subsequent tectono-magmatic events.  \n\n4) No simple closure of the ATJ is possible at anomaly C13, implying that deformation \n\nassociated with the Azores Triple Junction started prior to the 33.4 Ma. We need \n\ntherefore to evoke an Azores domain with a kinematic behavior independent of the two \n\nlarger plates. The expected position of the AHS implies little to no interaction of the hot \n\n 50 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nspot with the SATJ existed at this time, and that the onset of Azores domain and \n\ntopography might have been, mainly tectonically controlled these early stages.  \n\n5) Strong interaction of the SATJ with the AHS started probably at C6 times (20 Ma) \n\naccording to the models referred to in this study. After a period of intense melt \n\nproduction which reached a maximum at C5, rifting of the Azores plateau began around \n\n7 Ma.  Between C6 and C5 the EAFZ ceases to work as the SATJ, which departs from \n\nthe EAFZ (in a intra-transform context) northwestwards. The migration process lasted \n\nto through times earlier than 7 Ma, as the most probable morpho-structure corresponds \n\nto a valley largely depleted from magmatism, and therefore generated after the \n\nmaximum magmatic activity, AHS related. \n\n \n\n 51 \n\n\n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on MAR Seismicity \n\nIII.1 Hydrophone Arrays \n\nOne of the strategies designed to identify the effects of the AHS is the mapping of \n\nvolcanic and tectonic activity along the MAR.  This can be done very efficiently with \n\nthe use of hydrophone arrays, a technique developed for submarine acoustic surveying \n\nthat is now available for scientific use. In north Atlantic two autonomous hydrophone \n\nnetworks have operated in the past. A NSF network was deployed in February 1999 \n\nsouth of the Azores by NOAA/PMEL between latitudes 17\u00baN and 35\u00baN (Smith et al., \n\n2002 and 2003, Dziak et al., 2004), and was kept under operation until June 2005. The \n\nnorthern SIRENA (Goslin et al., 2004) network was setup as a joint France-USA-\n\nPortugal cooperative effort. It operated between latitudes 40\u00b0 20' N and 50\u00b0 30' N, from \n\nMay 2002 to September 2003. The two networks overlap in time for about 11 months, \n\ncomplementing one another therefore providing an earthquake monitoring of the entire \n\nNorthern Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis from 16\u00b0N to 50\u00b0N during that time span. \n\nThe main objective of the SIRENA array deployment was the long-term monitoring of \n\nearthquake activity occurring at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis. Such observations enable \n\nan understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of earthquakes along the MAR both \n\nin their tectonic segmentation context and in a broader scale as an indication of the \n\ninteractions between the slow spreading MAR and the Azores plume. \n\n 53 \n\n\n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity \n \n \nThe autonomous hydrophones are portable stand alone devices deployed at the water \n\ncolumn to passively register ocean noise for time spans that can reach 1.5 years. The \n\nsystem is programmed to record 1s data at 100 Hz (1 to 40 Hz band pass). The \n\nhydrophone (Figure III.1) is an instrument with 1.8 meters long and 0.17 m wide \n\nconsisting essentially of four components: the hydrophone itself and, packed within a \n\ntitanium pressure case, a signal pre-amplifier, a battery pack and the data logger.

The SOFAR channel \n\nAutonomous hydrophones are deployed in the SOFAR (SOund Fixing And Ranging) \n\nchannel. This ocean water layer is present in all the ocean basins, occurring in the \n\nAtlantic at depths between 700 and 1000 m. This channel forms at a minimum on a \n\nvertical sound velocity depth profile, resultant from the interplay between temperature \n\nand pressure variations with depth. The conjugate effect of sound velocity decrease at \n\nthe thermocline and the sound velocity increase due to pressure below it, generates a \n\nminimum-velocity channel in which acoustic waves remain trapped (Figure III.3).  \n\n \n\n \n\n 55 \n\n\n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III.3 \u2013 Top) scheme depicting SOFAR channel axis configuration and T-phase paths within \nit.

Having no interaction with \n\nthe sea surface nor the sea bottom, the SOFAR channel trapped acoustic phases suffer \n\nvery low signal attenuation, which enables the acoustic waves to travel effectively over \n\nvery long distances (up to several thousand km).  \n\n 56 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nIII.3 T phases \n\nSeismic waves from tectonic events or volcanic tremors, when crossing the rough sea-\n\nbottom to water interface, convert into acoustic waves called T-phases; T stands for \n\n\u201cTertiary\u201d as these waves travel more slowly in water (~1.5 km/s) than seismic waves \n\ndo within the solid Earth, arriving in third after the P and S waves on land seismic \n\nstations and hydrophones. Hydrophones can only register P and S phases, provided that \n\nthe seismic event is close to the instrument, as seismic phases attenuate rapidly within \n\nthe crust (within 150/200 km for medium magnitude earthquakes). An exception to this \n\nis the ability for hydrophones to detect by direct incidence of P waves generated at \n\ndistant epicenters from very high energy events. Due to their efficient propagation in the \n\nSOFAR channel, T-phases can be registered by the autonomous hydrophone, thousands \n\nof km away from their source area. \n\nIII.4 Data Analysis Interface  \n\nData recorded in each array instrument is accessed via \u201cSeasick\u201d, a NOAA developed \n\ndata analysis interface. It enables the analyst to display the data from each instrument \n\nsimultaneously on screen as a spectrogram (Figure III.4). In each channel Y axis is time, \n\nX axis is a frequency interval (from 0 to 140 Hz, but customizable) and a 10% cosine \n\ntapered amplitude spectrum of the signal record is color coded providing a measure by \n\nvisual inspection of earthquake acoustic magnitude. Time frequency resolution on \n\ndisplay of each scan line is customizable when justifiable but for a normal configuration \n\na time resolution of 4 s has proven to be a good trade off between analyzing a large \n\namount of data and getting accurate reduce errors in locations. Data is scrolled either \n\nsynchronized in time or at each channel time and the operator checks by visual \n\ninspection for signals over the background ocean noise.  \n\n 57 \n\n\n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III.4 - Screen capture of the interface from the program developed at NOAA, used to \nprocess the hydrophone data. In this example 4 hydrophones from SIRENA are displayed, along \nwith the software main command window. \n\n \n\nPicking earthquake signals is a simple but sometimes not straightforward task. The \n\noperator first performs a rough pick of the specific earthquake signal in each channel, \n\nand re-displays the histogram at a higher frequency resolution. By using criteria, \n\nnormally based on the scan lines which present the smallest frequencies with higher \n\namplitudes within the coda for that earthquake, a refined recalculation provides a more \n\naccurate prediction of position. This process is iteratively performed until the picking \n\nprocedure allows minimization of the errors. When picked successfully, the calculated \n\ntime, position, acoustic magnitude, and errors for this parameters as well as the number \n\n 58 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nof hydrophones used in the localization of the event are than stored on a posit files for \n\nposterior seismicity studies. ThePosit files from several arrays around the world are \n\nmade available on the NOAA website for download \n\n(http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/seismicity/seismicity.html). \n\nThe detailed description of the mathematical methods built-in on the program to provide \n\nT-phase source location and error estimates is out of scope of this work. Detailed \n\ninformation on this issue can be found in Fox et al. (2001).  Here we just summarize the \n\nprocedure briefly.  Using built-in models of ocean sound propagation velocities, sound \n\nis propagated from a preliminary location to the hydrophones using interactively a non \n\nlinear least square inversion method. Successive runs then, minimize the differences \n\nbetween predicted and recorded arrival times. Several solutions are calculated on each \n\nrun to check consistency of initial source location; these consider the source location \n\nfalling within the center of the array, outside the array from the direction of the \n\nhydrophone which registered the first arrival, and at the minimum residual error from a \n\ncoarser grid. The location is taken from the solution presenting the lowest root mean \n\nsquare (RMS) residual error.    \n\nIII.5 The SIRENA experiment  \n\nThe SIRENA Project was set up in 2000, as a result of a cooperative agreement between \n\nUMR6538/CNRS (Brest, France; PI J. Goslin), the \u201cG\u00e9osciences Marines Lab\u201d from \n\nIPG Paris, the PMEL/NOAA (Pacific Marine Environmental Lab, Newport, OR, USA), \n\nthe CGUL (Lisbon University Geophysical Center) and the CIMA (Marine and \n\nEnvironmental Research Center, University of Algarve \u2013 Portugal).   \n\n 59 \n\n\n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity \n \n \nTwo cruises have occurred within the framework of this project (Figure III.5): \n\nSIRENA1-2002 cruise aboard the R/V Le Suroit, starting in Ponta Delgada (A\u00e7ores) on \n\nMay, 16th and docking in Brest on June, 4th, 2002. Six hydrophones were successfully \n\ndeployed during SIRENA1 on both flanks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between \n\nKurtchatov Fracture Zone, immediately north of the Azores Plateau and a major \n\ndiscontinuity south of the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone (between 40\u00ba20\u2019N and 50\u00ba35\u2019N). \n\n(see report at http:// www-sdt.univ-brest.fr/ ~goslin/SIRENA/REPT). \n\nA multi-beam survey of the ridge axis between latitudes 48\u00b020\u2019N and 50\u00b005\u2019N was \n\ncompleted. Together with previous surveys, in particular TRIATNORD (Goslin et al, \n\n1999), these data provides complete bathymetry coverage from 40\u00b020\u2019N to 51\u00b055\u2019N \n\n(with the exception of the section between 46\u00b0N and 48\u00b020\u2019N, where only a few single-\n\nbeam and multi-beam tracks cross the MAR).  \n\nThe hydrophone array was recovered during the SIRENA II/D274 cruise, sailed by RRS \n\nDiscovery from Govan, Scotland (Sept, 12th, 2003) to Ponta Delgada (Oct, 1st, 2003). Of \n\nthe six hydrophones deployed in May 2002 (see site locations on Figure III.5), only five \n\nwere recovered during SIRENA2/D274. We were not able to recover S3. Hydrophones \n\nS1, S2, S4 and S5 recorded data during the entire time they were deployed.  S6 stopped \n\nrecording data on the 12th day after its deployment. Despite this drawback, the four \n\noperational hydrophones occupy the four corner sites of the array and data analysis \n\nindicates they provide accurate locations of earthquakes that occurred within the array.  \n\n 60 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III.5 - Ship tracks during the SIRENA1 (black) and SIRENA2/D274 (white) cruises.  \nIndexed stars indicate the positions of the SIRENA hydrophone mooring sites.  \n\n \n\nIII.6 SIRENA data processing \n\nThe hydrophone acoustic data analysis started in Brest in early November 2003. During \n\nthat initial time we concentrated on acoustic data recorded within periods during which \n\nevents were detected along the northern MAR by global seismic networks and listed in \n\nthe USGS earthquake data catalog. Such an approach allowed for a first-order estimate \n\nof the performance of the hydrophone network and provided new results on the seismic \n\nactivity of the MAR and on the Reykjanes ridge (Goslin et al., 2004) \n\n 61 \n\n\n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity \n \n \nIn general, even reduced to 4 instruments, the SIRENA array was able to detect and \n\nlocate earthquakes from as far south as the Sierra Leone Fracture Zone (around 7\u00b0N) \n\nand as far north as the the Reykjanes Ridge (62\u00baN) . The Sirena hydrophone array has \n\nalso observed seismic phases generated by distant earthquakes which have traveled \n\nthrough the lower mantle and core (Figure III.6). While hydrophones are capable of \n\nrecording acoustic signals originating from thousands of miles away, the presence of the \n\nshallow and extensive Azores Plateau disrupts the SOFAR channel and acts as a natural \n\nbarrier to sound propagation. Therefore this limits the ability of SIRENA network to \n\ndetect many of the events occurring along the MAR axis in the opposite sections of the \n\nMAR with regard to the Azores Plateau and increases the location error of the \n\nearthquakes that are detected.   \n\nMainly due to blocking effect of the Azores Plateau, we verified that a large number of \n\nevents was recorded by only three hydrophones (S2, S4 and S5 see Figure III.7). \n\nNumerous events have large location errors and plotted in an abnormal off-axis region \n\naround 33\u00baW, 44\u00baN.  \n\nIn order to get more constrained locations of these events, the SIRENA network data \n\nhas been re-processed together with the \u201cNSF array\u201d deployed south of the Azores, \n\nduring the common period of operation of both networks which extends from May 2002 \n\n(deployment of the SIRENA network) to April 2003 (last servicing of the South Azores \n\nnetwork).  \n\nAn evaluation of seismic events located with both networks suggests that this \n\nprocessing strategy has significantly improved the location of the events which occurred \n\nbetween latitudes 35\u00b0N and 41\u00b0N (the area between the two networks). \n\n 62 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III.6 - Example of hydrophone spectrograms displaying P phase arrivals from a large \nmagnitude earthquake (Ms = 7.6) with epicentre at the Middle America Trench (104\u00ba06\u00b4W, \n18\u00ba46\u201912\u2019\u2019N).

During the same period, land-\n\nbased networks localised 98 events along the same section of the MAR (as listed in the \n\nNEIC catalog). The hydrophone arrays thus recorded and localized close to 30 times as \n\nmany earthquakes as the land-based networks, thus exemplifying the large difference in \n\ndetection threshold between autonomous hydrophones and land-based stations (Dziak et \n\nal., 2004). Previous work along the 15\u00b0-35\u00b0 N section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge has \n\nshown that using autonomous hydrophones to detect earthquakes can lower the \n\ndetection threshold of events from the 4.6 mb of global seismic networks to 3.0 mb \n\n(Dziak et al., 2004), leading to a twenty-fold increase in the number of events detected. \n\nThe data now processed jointly, confirms this. The hydrophone array succeeded in \n\ndetecting - and precisely locating - about thirty more MAR events than the global \n\nseismological networks over the same time period. As an example, 66 small-magnitude \n\nearthquakes were detected and localized near 48\u00b0N, 27\u00b0W, while the global networks \n\nonly observed a single event (with a magnitude mb =4.6). Since these earthquakes are \n\nlocated within the hydrophone network, their location error is less than a few kilometers \n\nin latitude and longitude. \n\nIII.8 Large wavelength variation in seismicity patterns with latitude  \n\nThe spatial distribution of the seismicity rate vs. latitude shows a remarkable first-order \n\nlong-wavelength pattern: 1) the seismicity rate is low when approaching the Azores and \n\nIceland (reaching values as low as 10 events/d\u00b0), while it peaks to 70 events/d\u00b0 in the \n\nvicinity of the Gibbs FZ (Figure III.9a). 2) moreover, the latitudinal distribution of the \n\nseismicity  hints  at  an  asymmetric  influence  of  the  Azores  hotpot on the MAR: 720   \n\n 65 \n\n\n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure III.8 - Earthquake epicenters from June 1st to feb 28th 2003. Black dots epicenters from \nhydrophones. White triangles events registered in the NEIC seismic catalogue. White circles point \nthe hydrophone position from the NSF southern array. Triangles point the SIRENA hydrophone \nlocations. \n\n \n\n 66 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nevents have been localized inside the SIRENA array (between latitudes 40\u00b020'N and \n\n50\u00b030'N), while 453 earthquakes have occurred south of the Azores, along a section of \n\nthe MAR of similar latitudinal extent (28\u00b0N > 38\u00b0N). \n\nThe spatial distribution of the seismicity rates (Figure III.9a) along the MAR anti-\n\ncorrelates well, at long wavelengths, with the zero-age depths (Figure III.9c). These \n\ncorrelations fit in well with the now classical image of a hotspot-influenced slow \n\nspreading centre: globally thicker and more ductile crust would be emplaced along ridge \n\nsegments closer to the hotspot, while the thinner, colder and more brittle crust emplaced \n\nalong ridge sections free from the hotspot influence would produce a higher seismicity. \n\nFinally, the along-ridge seismicity distribution correlates with the Vs velocity anomalies \n\nat 100 km in the upper mantle (Figure III.9b). It is thus proposed that the thermal regime \n\nof the upper mantle, as it results in variations of the rheology and thickness of the crust, \n\nwould be an important factor   controlling the spatial distribution of the seismicty. The \n\nlater could then be used as an additional tool to characterize the along-ridge \n\nasymmetrical influence of the Azores and Iceland hotspots on the MAR slow-spreading \n\ncenter, as it was proposed by Goslin et al. (1999). Our study thus confirms the \n\nasymmetry which was inferred earlier from global studies (e.g. Goslin et al., 1998; \n\n1999). \n\nIII.9 Time-wise seismicity distributions along the MAR \n\nSimilarly to what was observed for the spatial distribution of the seismicity along the \n\nRidge, and even if a ten-month period cannot be considered as fully representative, \n\ntime-wise distributions of the seismicity along the MAR (Figure III.10) show very \n\ndifferent behaviours: 1) some sections of the MAR, which are considered as undergoing \n\nlittle influenced by the Azores hotspot (e.g. the 46\u00b0-49\u00b0N section) are the loci of more  \n\n 67 \n\n\n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure III.9 - Plot of observables along the ridge filtered through a 5\u00ba Gaussian filter vs. latitude. \nTop) Seismicity rate.

These \n\n 69 \n\n\n\n \nChapter III \u2013 Azores Hotspot Influence on the MAR seismicity \n \n \ndistributions bring new insights both on ridge/hotspot interactions and on accretion \n\nprocesses along a hotspot-influenced spreading center.  \n\nAt long wavelengths, along-ridge seismicity rates appear closely correlated with other \n\nobservables which characterize the thermal regime of the crust and upper mantle. These \n\nspatial correlations seem to confirm that the strong influence exerted on the MAR by the \n\nAzores plume extends over a long distance to the South and that its extension is more \n\nlimited to the north of the hotspot.  \n\nAt the ridge segment scale, time-wise epicentre distributions show that two different \n\nmodes can be observed in the MAR seismicity: A high and constant seismicity rate \n\nwould result from dominantly tectonic processes characterize colder sections of the \n\nRidge. Conversely, a more episodic low-rate seismicity, which would be due to \n\nmagmatic processes is observed near the centers of globally hotter - because they are \n\nlocated closer to the Azores hotspot?- segments. \n\nIt is however important to recall that the Azores plateau interrupts the SOFAR channel \n\ntherefore inhibiting the accurate detection of hydro-accoustic events from the Azores \n\nplateau. This might lead to a biased analysis when transported to the Azores Plateau \n\ncontext. In the Azores, earthquake activity registered by local and global land based \n\nseismological networks, (as we shall address in the next chapter) is abundant in the \n\nsome of the regions within the plateau, noticeably along the Terceira axis, as a result of \n\ntectonic and volcanic activity.  In the Azores the thermal structure and consequently the \n\nlithosphere thickness along the Terceira axis are almost certainly quite different from \n\nthose of the MAR north and south of the Azores, and probably progressively thicker \n\n 70 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \ntowards the Gloria fault (Bier, 2005), therefore favoring the onset of seismicity due to \n\nincrease in thickness of brittle sections of the lithosphere.  \n\n 71 \n\n\n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nChapter IV - Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary  \n\nIV.1 Introduction \n\nThe determination of the Terceira axis segmentation pattern, the location of actively \n\nspreading segments and discontinuities, the areal extent of the plate boundary itself, are \n\nnot easily definable. Poor definition of the plate boundary location arises probably from \n\nthe combination of factors like the extremely reduced spreading rate promoting an \n\nunstructured pattern of magnetic anomalies or the highly discontinuous nature of \n\naccretion, and the complex tectonic pattern. For example, it remains unclear, due to \n\nabsence of clear  age relations which structures within the Terceira axis are actively \n\ndeforming, and if accretion is taking place in the topographical highs or lows, in the \n\nsubmarine areas.  \n\nThe beginning of GPS observation in the Azores with the installation in 1998 of the \n\nTANGO (Trans-Atlantic Network for Geodynamics and Oceanography) project (Bastos \n\net al., 1998) has enabled to study from the geodetic point of view the present day \n\ndisplacement field associated with the Azores Triple Junction. \n\nIn this chapter we review the models presented by different authors addressing the \n\ntectonic pattern of the EU-NUB plate boundary in the present day. We summarize the \n\nmain seismo-tectonic observations and discuss new geodetic data presented by \n\nFernandes et al. (2006). We first examine segmentation geometry by comparing the \n\n 73 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IV \u2013 Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \nobserved displacement field with the predictions from two plate tectonic model based \n\non geodetic data: DEOS2k (Fernandes et al., 2003) and NUVEL-1A model (DeMets et \n\nal., 1994). Finally, the observed relative velocity field is used to test a half-space elastic \n\ndislocation model for a synthetic plate boundary configuration. The results derived from \n\nthis model are used to deduce the geometry of the present-day plate boundary and the \n\nwidth of the actively inter-plate region.  \n\nIV.2 Models based on morpho-tectonic and seismo-tectonic analysis  \n\nBased on sonar GLORIA images interpretations, Searle (1980) has presented a tentative \n\nsegmentation pattern for this spreading center (Figure IV.1).  This author considered \n\nthat the present day position of the ATJ was located at the intersection of the North \n\nAzores Fracture Zone with the Terceira axis. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.1 - Terceira axis segmentation pattern according to Searle (1980). \n\n 74 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nRecent improvements on the quality of the baseline data, namely on the regional \n\nbathymetric coverage (Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998, Gente et al., 2003) along with detailed \n\ntectonic work performed at Pico, Faial and S. Jorge Islands from the Central group \n\n(Madeira and Ribeiro, 1990) has led to models addresing the present day tectonic \n\nregime of the ATJ and the stress pattern within the Eurasian-African plate boundary.  \n\nEarly views on the Terceira Axis as a simple rift system were considerably affected by a \n\nmajor earthquake event (magnitude 7.2) that took place the 1st Jannuary 1980 west of \n\nTerceira Island. (Hirn et al., 1980). Contrary to what should be expectable, that is \n\nextension or oblique extension along normal faults parallel to the N120\u00ba strike of the \n\nTerceira axis, the aftershock sequence of this event was well constrained along a left \n\nlateral N150\u00ba pure strike slip fault (Hirn  et al., 1980) thus inconsistent with a simple \n\nspreading geometry. Madeira and Ribeiro (1990), considering the mapped fault families \n\nalong the N150\u00ba and N120\u00ba, both displaying kinematic criteria ranging from dip slip to \n\noblique slip faults to pure strike slip faults respectively as left lateral and right lateral, \n\nsuggested that the tectonic regime was transtensional with a right lateral component and \n\nlocated the plate boundary at the S. Jorge channel (Figure IV.2).  \n\nA similar stress pattern, but a considerably different plate boundary configuration was \n\nproposed by Louren\u00e7o et al. (1998) using the fissural systems, represented by the linear \n\nvolcanic ridges, as kinematic indicators (Figure IV.3).

They also observed the right lateral \n\ntranstensional character of the Azores domain which is interpreted as simultaneously \n\nacting as an ultra-slow spreading centre at the Terceira axis and a transfer zone which \n\naccommodates the dextral differential movement between stables Eurasian and African \n\nplates. \n\nMiranda et al., (1998) considering the earthquake distribution from local seismic \n\nnetwork, data form a passive OBS survey and the focal mechanisms from Azores \n\nevents, also inferred a transtensional regime from the tectonic fault system, where EU-\n\nAF inter-plate right lateral shear would be partitioned between the two fault systems in a \n\nframework of a tectonic block model (Figure IV.4). According to these authors, the \n\ninterplay between the two faulting directions defines the current morpho-structure of the \n\nTerceira axis, where the basins are considered to coincide with tectonic blocks. The \n\nshear deformation along the plate boundary would be accommodated by rotation of the \n\ndifferent fault controlled tectonic blocks. \n\nMore recently, Vogt and Jung (2003) returned to early views which approached \n\nTerceira axis as a classical rift system. They classified the Terceira axis as a young (&lt;1 \n\nMa) intra-oceanic oblique spreading rift system. Noticing the extremely low spreading \n\nrates between EU and NUB predicted by NUVEL1A, and by comparing the first order \n\nmorphological structures of the Terceira axis with other ultra-slow and super-slow ridge \n\nsystems such as the Garkel, The Mohns- Knipovitch or the SWIR ridge systems, they \n\nconclude that the Terceira axis (designated by these authors as Terceira rift) is the \n\nslowest spreading environment in the world ridge system.  \n\n 77 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IV \u2013 Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.4 - Tectonic block model sketched by Miranda et al (1998). See text for details \n\n \n\nIn their view the plate boundary is located solely along the Terceira axis and, \n\nanalogously to Searle\u2019s interpretation they locate the ATJ at the intersection of the \n\nTerceira axis with the MAR along the N. Azores Fracture Zone. Their interpretation of \n\n 78 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nTerceira axis as an oblique rift zone excludes the block tectonic model presented by \n\nMiranda et al. (1998)  as Terceira axis basins are considered to correspond merely to \n\nsegments of the rift valley which were not filled with volcanism. \n\nVolcano-tectonic activity on the inner sectors of the plateau south of the Terceira axis is \n\ndisregarded by these authors as significant and part of the plate boundary zone \n\nprocesses. Rather they consider that these structures are linked to and are a result of ATJ \n\npast northward migrating history in close link to the AHS migration northwards. They \n\ninterpret their growth as a result of magmatism remnant of HS activity under short-lived \n\npresently abandoned rift axes. These interpretations and the significance of the linear \n\nvolcanic ridges as a part of the actual plate boundary processes will be discussed more \n\nthoroughly in the next chapter. \n\nIV.3 Earthquake data \n\nIV.3.1 Epicenter spatial distributions \n\nThe Azores plateau displays quite a high level of seismicity but of low magnitude. The \n\nepicentral locations shown in Figure IV.5 comprise the time span between 1994 and \n\n2004, and are taken from the ISC (\u201cinternational Seismological Catalogue\u201d). We opted \n\nto disregard epicenters from previous dates because 1994 was the year were the local \n\nbased SIVISA network entered in operation and corresponds to a better azimuthal \n\ncoverage and better constrained epicenter locations. Nevertheless, the period chosen \n\ncovers the time span of GPS TANGO network observations and provides a good \n\nreference on how active processes distribute across the plateau. \n\nThe seismicity displays some amount of scattering but is largely aligned along the \n\nTerceira Axis in a band ca. 80 km wide for its central and eastern part., essentially \n\n 79 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IV \u2013 Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \nconfined within its northern and southern walls. In the western sector the band of \n\nseismicity widens to about 180 km, and is limited to the south by Condor volcanic ridge  \n\nand the northen wall of Terceira axis between Terceira and Western Graciosa basin. \n\n It is worth noting that the majority of epicenters are located on submarine areas. The \n\nIslands generally display few occurrences. Islands such as Pico, S. Jorge, Graciosa, \n\nTerceira and S. Maria are earthquake depleted. Exceptions to this scenario are S. Miguel \n\nand Faial Islands. In the case of Faial, the earthquake cluster located NE of the Island \n\ncorresponds to main shock and aftershock sequences resulting from the 1999 destructive \n\nearthquake that struck the Island, with epicenter NE of the Island (See section IV.4). \n\nThe earthquake activity in S, Miguel is of low magnitude swarm like type and is \n\nprobably related with volcanic activity at two volcanic systems within the Island, The \n\nSete cidades caldera on the NW tip of the Island and the Fogo Caldera a volcano located \n\nnear the center of the Island within the NW-SE trending Congro graben. Both systems \n\nhave been displaying signs of activity in recent times.  \n\nOther spatial clusters of activity along time are mainly focused, despite the scatter, \n\nseawards west of volcanic ridges: Condor, Pico-Faial S. Jorge and within Terceira axis: \n\nWest Graciosa Basin and at the SE Terceira ridge between D. Jo\u00e3o de Castro bank and \n\nTerceira Island  \n\nIV.3.2 Focal Mechanisms at the Azores \n\nThere are limited moment centroid solutions available at the Azores. These are \n\npresented in Figure IV.5 following Harvard CMT convention. The vast majority of the \n\nsolutions are of low magnitude pure normal faulting events or with a minor component \n\nof right lateral strike slip along N120\u00ba planes (Grimison and Chen, 1986; Bufforn et al,. \n\n 80 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n1988). These events present normally traction T axes directions nearly perpendicular to \n\nthe Terceira axis at each location. This progressive rotation of tectonic directions from \n\nWNW-ESE to nearly N-S at the intersection of the Terceira axis with the Gloria fault \n\nwas already recognized by Luis (1996) and Louren\u00e7o et al., (1998).  \n\nTwo thrust events are documented in the Azores region. One is located north of the D. J. \n\nCastro bank and was re-evaluated by Buforn et al. (1988) as a dominantly right lateral \n\nstrike slip event along a nearly East-West direction or conversely a left lateral strike slip \n\nalong a N-S fault plane. Another thrust event is located SE of S. Miguel near the \n\nformigas islets. Its significance remains unclear, but might be related with structural \n\ncomplexities at the intersection between the Terceira axis and the Gloria fault. \n\nThe highest magnitude events registered instrumentally that have occurred in the Azores \n\nare of pure left lateral strike slip faulting along directions ranging NW-SE to N-S. This \n\nfaulting direction was first interpreted by analysis of aftershock epicenter distributions \n\n(Hirn et al., 1980) following the highly destructive M = 7.2, Terceira, 1st Jannuray 1980 \n\nearthquake with epicenter at the Eastern Graciosa Basin.  \n\nIV.4 The Faial 1998 earthquake  \n\nThis earthquake occurred on July 9th 1998, with epicenter at the sea 10 km NE of Faial \n\nat a SIVISA computed location of 38\u00ba38.05\u2019N  28\u00ba31.38\u2019 W (Senos et al., 1998).  This \n\nevent had a Mw = 6.1 and caused 8 casualties and 1500 homeless. Figure IV.5 displays \n\nthe focal mechanism for this event. Two conjugate planes determined are: Strike N61\u00ba \n\ndip 82\u00ba and rake -180\u00ba and strike 151\u00ba, dip 90\u00ba, rake -8\u00ba.  \n\nSoon after the main shock, the seismological network was up-graded and documented \n\nwith very detail the aftershock sequence  that followed,  registering  thousands  of small  \n\n 81 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IV \u2013 Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.5 \u2013 Top) Moment centroid solutions from NEIC for most significant earthquakes \ndetected in the global and local networks see text for details.

The resulting epicenter distribution pattern displays a \n\nmajor alignment along the N151\u00ba direction but is cut trough by epicenter alignments \n\nwhich follow the other conjugate nodal plane direction. Fernandes et al. (2002) using \n\nGPS data from the TANGO network, isolated the co-seismic displacement  component \n\nand modeled the dislocations provided by the two possible fault solutions in an \n\nhomogeneous elastic half-space. Results from their modeling procedure did not provide \n\nany additional tectonic constraints, as both fault solutions provided equally satisfactory \n\nfits to the observations.   \n\nMore recently, Dias (2006) performed a complete re-evaluation of the earthquake \n\nsequence following the main shock and aftershock epicenters have been re-located and \n\nfocal mechanisms resultant from that event have been revised and up-graded from \n\nprevious publications on the subject. Considering the aftershocks epicentral distribution, \n\nthey cluster in two nearly ortogonal tectonic directions following the main shock \n\nrupture. Focal mechanisms display a complex pattern, and in any case, both possible \n\nfault planes are clearly discordant from the orientation of Faial Island main faults \n\n(Figure IV.6). Ruptures in the N60\u00ba direction, are dominantly oblique right lateral \n\nnormal faulting events. On the contrary focal mechanism distributed along the N160-\n\nN170\u00ba vary between dip slip normal events and others which display a marked left \n\nlateral strike slip component. The significance of these strike slip events, for the \n\ntectonics of the present day tectonics of the Triple Junction will be dealt with in chapter \n\nVIII. \n\n \n\n 83 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IV \u2013 Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.6 - Re-location of the events registered in July 1998 following the Faial earthquake.

The gray focal \nmechanisms are composed. NEIC corresponds to main shock centered on the epicentral \nrelocalization performed by Dias  (2006).  \n\n \n\nIV.5 Geodetic Data \n\nIV.5.1 The TANGO experiment \n\nThe initial TANGO network consisted of one station per Island (cf. Figure IV.7) and \n\nwas re-occupied with an approximate triennial periodicity until 1997. In 1999, DEOS \n\n 84 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n(Department of Earth Observation and Satellite systems) and AOUP (Astronomical \n\nObservatory of University of Porto) initiated a collaboration with the aim of maintaining \n\nand expanding the original network. In September-October 1999, 26 new sites were \n\nobserved for the first time on the Central Group of the Azores Archipelago. In addition, \n\ntwo permanent GPS stations were installed on Faial (2000) and Terceira (2001). In \n\n2001, CGUL (University of Lisbon Geophysical Center), in collaboration with DEOS \n\nand AOUP, added 30 new GPS stations in Terceira (May 2001, see Navarro et al., \n\n2003) and Faial and Pico (October 2001) Islands. These stations are being observed \n\nevery year to address the intra-Island displacement field over the Central Group. Figure \n\nIV.7 presents the actual GPS network in the Central Group of the Azores Archipelago. \n\nThis will be referred to here as the Extended TANGO network. \n\nResults from the initial TANGO network for the period 1988-1997 were already \n\npresented by Bastos et al. (1998). A new evaluation of the TANGO network for the \n\n1993-2000 period was presented by Fernandes et al. (2004). The 1988 and 1991 \n\nTANGO campaigns were not considered due to their low quality. The average opening \n\nrate of the Middle Atlantic Ridge at the latitude of Graciosa/Corvo Islands was re-\n\nevaluated as 23 mm/yr, consistent with global kinematic models, such as NUVEL-1A \n\n(DeMets et al., 1994), and with local studies based on marine magnetic anomalies (Luis, \n\n1996).  \n\nIV.5.2 GPS Results \n\nThe processing schemes for data used in this chapter are detailed in Fernandes et al., \n\n2006. They use daily solutions from each campaign and combine them into a single \n\ncampaign solution. Table IV.1 lists the overall r.m.s. of the residuals for the reference \n\nstations used in each campaign. The overall residuals in all campaigns range between 1 \n\n 85 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IV \u2013 Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \nmm and 3 mm in the horizontal components and, between 4 mm and 8 mm in the \n\nvertical component. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.7 - GPS sites in the Azores Archipelago observed since 1988 (the Central Group is \nevidenced due to the large number of stations recently installed). Gray lines show the location of the \nsegments used in the elastic modeling procedure). \n\n \n\nA procedure was then followed to retrieve the velocity solutions relative to a geodetic \n\nreference model, the ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame) 2000 (Altamimi \n\net al., 2002). This model defines a set of coordinates and velocities for a series of \n\nfiducial points on the Earth surface therefore providing a frame to which the velocity \n\nsolutions for each campaign can be compared.  \n\n \n\n 86 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nTable IV.1 - r.m.s. of the residuals on the mapping for each campaign \n\n \n\nCampaign North East Up Number of \n\n \nMm mm mm Reference Stations \n\nNov 1993 2.7 2.8 6.5 12 \n\nOct 1994 2.6 1.7 8.3 11 \n\nMay 1997 2.0 2.5 7.7 17 \n\nOct 1999 1.6 3.1 5.6 18 \n\nOct 2000 1.6 2.5 4.0 17 \n\nApr 2001 2.9 2.7 5.7 15 \n\nOct 2001 1.3 3.1 6.1 15 \n\nThe velocities relative to ITRF2000 of the six stations in the Central and Eastern groups \n\nof the Azores - that correspond to the longest observation periods - are plotted in Figure \n\nIV.8. In the same Figure, velocities computed from kinematic plate models, assuming \n\nstable Nubia or stable Eurasia behaviors are also plotted relative to ITRF2000. This is \n\ndone for DEOS2k (Fernandes et al., 2003), NUVEL-1A (DeMets et al.,1994) and \n\nREVEL (Sella et al., 2002) models. \n\nThe time-series for Faial station (FAIM) is not shown. As discussed by Fernandes et al. \n\n(2002), there is a sudden slope change between the 1997 and the 1999 observations due \n\nto the co-seismic elastic deformation associated with the 1998.08.09 Faial earthquake. \n\nTherefore, due to the short time-span after the earthquake, the FAIM site is disregarded \n\nin our analysis.  \n\n 87 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IV \u2013 Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \nConcerning the Island of Santa Maria, the available time series matches well with stable \n\n\u201cNubian\u201d behavior. The other \"end-member\" of the displacement field corresponds to \n\nthe Island of Graciosa: the available time series matches well the predicted \"Eurasian\" \n\nbehavior. This observation (like the previous one) does not depend on the choice of the \n\nglobal plate kinematic model (cf. Figure IV.8). \n\nAll other stations display an intermediate behavior that can be seen as a weighted \n\naverage between pure Eurasian and pure Nubian behavior. Even Terceira, which is close \n\nto the northern border of the Azores plateau, displays this intermediate behavior. If the \n\nPico and S. Jorge stations are compared, they show similar motions. Therefore, most of \n\nthe relative divergent movement must be accommodated between S. Jorge and Graciosa \n\nIsland. Nevertheless, it is clear for this analysis that inter-plate displacements as \n\nmeasured from GPS are not confined to the Terceira axis. \n\nIV.5.3 Half space Elastic dislocation modeling  \n\nThe observed displacement field for the Azores Islands may be due to both elastic and \n\ninelastic processes. The viability of a purely elastic model with slip on buried \n\ndislocations (considered as the active plate boundary) can be investigated, if an a-priori \n\nlocation of the boundary is available. The most diagnostic information to locate the \n\nactive spreading area comes from magnetic anomalies. Luis (1996) made a large-scale \n\naeromagnetic survey that allowed the identification of a series of magnetic highs, \n\nfollowing the alignment of the Islands that was interpreted as neo-volcanic axes. The \n\nsegmentation pattern deduced from magnetic data is represented in Figure IV.7. \n\n \n\n \n\n 88 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n \n\nigure IV.8 - Horizontal motions for the six TANGO sites with longest observation periods in the \nral and Eastern groups.

Elastic model prediction (diamond) uses DEOS2k for boundary conditions. \nUncertainties are shown as 95 % confidence ellipses. \n\n 89 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IV \u2013 Defining the present day EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \nHere we tested two segmentation patterns: one where the plate boundary consists of 6 \n\nsegments which follow the Terceira axis and intersect the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the \n\nNorth Azores Fracture zone corresponding to the segmentation models proposed by \n\nSearle (1980) and corroborated by Vogt and Jung (2003) referred to hereafter as one \n\naxis model, and one that considers a Triple Junction further south following the \n\nwestward prolongation of Faial-Pico direction towards the Mid-Atlantic Ridge \n\ncorresponding to the segmentation pattern solution proposed by Luis et al., 1996, based \n\non magnetic anomalies and kinematic premises (Table IV.2), this will be referred to as \n\nthe two axis model.  \n\nThe elastic models were computed using the half-space approach (Okada, 1985). Each \n\nrids (the inter-plate displacements) from the elastic model \n\ndomain) the displacement is maximum for the given plate boundary configuration and \n\nboundary segment has rectangular shape; its top follows the magnetic lineation and is \n\nlocated at the locking depth of 8 km. This depth defines the base of lithosphere \n\ndeforming elastically due to continuous inelastic inter-plate strain below. The slip vector \n\nfor each fault is determined from the projection of the DEOS2k and NUVEL1A relative \n\nvelocity models between NUB and EU plates at the segment centre considering a fixed \n\nEurasian Plate (Table IV.2). \n\nThe predicted displacement g\n\nare referenced to the segments used in the modeling procedure. These are subsequently \n\nconverted into a tectonic plate reference frame. The Nubia displacement field with \n\nrelation to a fixed Eurasian plate, predicted with Nuvel1A or Deos2K, is calculated and \n\nsubtracted from the model grids. The resulting grid (see Figures IV.9 and IV.10) \n\npresents the interplate expectable deformation zone  between stable Eurasia (where the \n\ndisplacement is overall null) and stable African plate where beyond the inter plate \n\n 90 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nreference kinematic model.

The divergence between the two mega-plates \n\nand the Pico-Faial lineaments, along which the high-amplitude \n\nctive plate boundary area is still unclear, and one of the main objectives of this work \n\nwas to get information from the GPS velocity field distribution to better understand its \n\nroad structure. \n\nons (Graciosa and S. Maria) display a clear \n\ninematic behavior, with a displacement that follows respectively the Eurasian and \n\nNubian velocity vectors retrieved from DEOS2k. This result is consistent with the fact \n\nthat no significant active tectonic active structures are known north of Graciosa or south \n\nf Santa Maria (Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998). Moreover, Santa Maria lacks any documented \n\nneo-tectonic activity. In the case of Graciosa, we must still keep in mind that there is \n\nhistorical volcanic and seismic activity locally. Thus, even if the behavior concerning \n\ne last decade matches \"pure Eurasia\" and even if most of the present day Eurasia-\n\nubia divergence in this sector of the boundary is accommodated further south, it still \n\nlies on an active deformation area. This seems to corroborate, at least from the geodetic \n\noint of view, the model of broad segmentation proposed by Luis et al. (1998). \n\n should be emphasized that a time-scale problem exists in comparing current day plate \n\noundary configuration from GPS measurements with that deduced from plate tectonic \n\nmodels that integrate the past 3 Myr (DeMets et al., 1994).

The Azores Plateau would have been formed by successive NE \n\njumps of the oblique spreading axis, where the present Terceira Rift is the latest stage. \n\nThese authors also suggest that the Azores Triple Point is located in the prolongation of \n\nstress locking during inter-seismic periods, co-seismic induced deformation and swarm \n\nactivity, not necessarily associated with expressed volcanic phenomena, can all be \n\naccounted for as transtensive strain, and thus condition the configuration and mechanics \n\nof the inter-plate deformation zone. \n\nFrom Figure IV.11, which shows both the main topographic features along the Azores \n\nplateau together with the mean velocities deduced from the GPS array, it can be seen \n\nthat most of the deformation (that appears in the GPS mean velocities as a change \n\nbetween Nubian velocities at south\n\nto the highly tectonized area that includes the Islands themselves, as well as the \n\nneighboring submarine topographic highs.  \n\nThe presented preliminary results (mean velocities) concerning the Extended-TANGO \n\nnetwork show consistency with the motions deduced from the longer time-series. Table \n\nIV.4 lists the weighted averaged of the motions for each Island considering all observed \n\nstations (the associated uncertainty is the weighted r.m.s. of the residuals). Due to large \n\nuncertainties, the differences observed to date cannot, at present, be interpreted in terms \n\nof intra-Island tectonics.

This is valid taking both DEOS2K and \n\nNUVEL1A kinematic models as reference.  \n\nHowever, the short time span in geodetic observations only provides a snapshot of \n\npresent day kinematic context. The existence of seismo-tectonic and volcanic activity \n\nalong the westernmost sectors of the Terceira axis, implies that geologically the plate \n\nboundary is not confined to MAR-Faial-Pico segment and if both segments coexist in \n\ntime, some active transfer zone is bound to exist between this two overlapping axis. \n\nThe area enclosed in between these two axis is characterized by a series of sub-parallel \n\nlinear volcanic ridges (Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998) (see Figures V.1 and V.2), dividing flat \n\nterraces with a uniform depth of 1200 m bsl.  This domain encompasses the S. Jorge \n\nIsland, The Faial-Pico itself and two co-planar linear volcanic ridges designated by \n\n\u201cCondor Mar\u201d and \u201cCondor Terra\u201d, It will be referred to hereafter as the LVR Sector 1. \n\n 101 \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \nThese ridges have a characteristic spacing of 30 to 40 km and a uniform axial \n\norientation of N120\u00ba.  \n\n \n\nFigure V.1 - Shaded bathymetry of LVR sector 1 and 2.

Continuous lines and P1 to P4 denote bathymetric/topographic \nprofiles displayed in Figure V.2.  \n\n \n\nFurther East, a second set sub parallel volcanic ridges (Sector 2) is observed. It \n\ncomprises the East Pico Volcanic Ridge (EPVR) the South Terceira Volcanic Ridge \n\n(STVR) and a undesignated volcanic ridge further SW.  When compared to sector 1, the \n\nLVR present a similar spacing (about ca. 30 km ) and a marked rotated axial orientation \n\n(N140\u00ba). The EPVR is the submarine prolongation of the Pico Island south-eastwards, \n\nthe STVR on the contrary does not have any correspondence to LVR sector 1 structures. \n\nThe flat terraces separating these LVR are 500 m deeper than those of sector 1.

Given the uncertainty in the \n\nrelative ages of the structures (as previously discussed in Chapter II), we foccus analysis \n\nin characterizing structures which prove either from magnetic anomalies or by \n\nneotectonic indicators to be currently active.   \n\nOur goal is three folded: 1) to characterize the seaflor geology of the different volcanic \n\nridges. 2) To verify if any qualitative age progression exists amongst them in each \n\nindividual sector and between adjacent sectors. 3) To evaluate the tectono-magmatic \n\nnature of the plate boundary processes and the dynamics of the transfer zone. \n\nV.2 Data \n\nV.2.1 Marine Magnetic data \n\nTo evaluate more thoroughly the nature of the seafloor, especially in what concerns \n\ndistribution of recent volcanism within the Azores Plateau, and to validate geological \n\ninterpretations of the sonar images, we produced a new magnetic map which \n\ncomplements that of Luis, 1996 presented in chapter II (cf. Figure II.6). \n\nThis new map has the advantage of the magnetometer being closer to the source \n\nmagnetic layer as it results exclusively from marine magnetic observations and has \n\ntherefore a higher resolution more suitable to complement finer scale TOBI sonar \n\nimages interpretations.

It consisted of two legs \n\nwith a stop at Faial Island for partial crew turn-over. The first leg allowed 10 days of \n\ncontinuous coverage of TOBI sonar, chirp sonar, bathymetry and surface magnetic data, \n\nsoutheast of Pico, S. Jorge and Terceira Island. The second leg provided equivalent data \n\non a region comprising the Condor Ridge and the West of Faial and S. Jorge submarine \n\nprolongations. The sonar data acquired covers a total of 5 complete LVR and the west \n\nsector of S. Jorge and Faial LVR (Figure V.5). The general quality of the data is fairly \n\ngood with the exception of the shallow portions on the top of the Condor Ridge (south \n\nof Faial). The analysis of the mosaic corresponding to the SETVR will be performed in \n\nthe next chapter. \n\nTOBI Sonar is a multi-sensor platform tow-yawed between 200 and 500 m from the \n\nbottom.  It was equipped with a two sided 30 kHz sidescan sonar, a 7.5 kHz sub-bottom \n\nprofiler, a CTD, a three-axis fluxgate magnetometer and a range of vehicle attitude \n\nsensors (i.e pitch, roll and heading from a gyro-compass). The instrument is towed with \n\na 200 m umbilical behind a depressor weigth detaching the instrument from ship \n\nmovement. TOBI position was achieved by using the ships\u2019 Simrad-Konsgberg HPR-\n\n1507 system and a long-range (6km) transponder, that was mounted 45 deg. below the \n\nTOBI\u2019s depressor. Sonar has a total swath width of 6 to 8 km, and footprints of 4x 7 m \n\nnear the fish track but higher for the outer beams  \n\nEach mosaic results in a 8 bit image (256 tons of gray) where white pixels portrait high \n\nbackscaterring surfaces and black pixels correspond to acoustic shadows. These images \n\nwere drapped on top of bathymetric digital terrain models. The magnetic anomaly map \n\nwas overlain on top of the composition to further constrain the interpretations. \n\n 107 \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \n\n \n\nV.3 Magnetic anomalies and Acoustic Facies interpretation \n\nV.3.1 LVR Sector 1  \n\nThe available mosaics show quite clearly that the bulk of active volcanic activity in the \n\nAzores western sector is concentrated in LVR, these structures correlate strongly with \n\npositive magnetic anomalies. Furthermore their surroundings are almost exclusively \n\ncomposed of a greyish homogeneous facies interpreted as pelagic and volcanic sediment \n\nand turbidite fans. \n\nThe main volcanic facies present are homogeneous high backscatter surfaces probably \n\nrelated with massive flows, hummocky textures related with pillow mound formation, \n\nand individual circular volcanic cones sometimes with visible craters, that can reach \n\nseveral tens of meters high. They occur both oriented along LVR major axis direction, \n\nparallel to fault scarps, or as individual cones with a somewhat more random spatial \n\ndistribution.  \n\nIt is possible to observe a high backscatter surface prolonging from the Capelinhos \n\n1957/58 eruption site in the western tip of Faial for about 20 km towards WNW. This \n\nhigh backscattering surface is cut by a well marked lineation interpreted as a major \n\nfissure which aligns up with the Western Faial fissural system.  (Figure V.6).  \n\nDue to its shallow depth the axial structure of the Condor ridge is poorly imaged. Figure \n\nV.7 displays a high backscattering surface, suggesting a recent nature of the volcanic \n\nterrain which contrasts with the surrounding greyish areas interpreted as pelagic or \n\nvolcanic  sediment.

No \n\nclear tectonic structures are here visible. \n\nBoth LVR and corresponding tips correspond to  marked positive anomalies probably \n\nBrunhes and their surroundings are a wide area of negative polarity (probably \n\nMatuyama), which in the case of West condor ridge define two elongated magnetic \n\nanomaly lows parallel the axis of the LVR. It is not clear if in this case, the negative \n\nbands were generated at the axis of the W Condor ridge and than rafted sideways. \n\nHowever, given the flatness of the W Condor ridge surroundings and the lack of \n\nsignificant tectonic or volcanic structures we come to an interpretation where the W \n\nCondor ridge has simply grown over a negative polarity basement.  \n\nThe seawards prolongation of the S. Jorge Island shows features which are somewhat \n\ndistinct from the observations of Faial western sector (Figure V.8). The prominent \n\ninland fissural system aligned along the Island central axis prolongs seawards in the \n\nsame direction for about 12 km. The submarine extent of the Island western tip displays \n\na series of acoustic echoes which, probably due to its shallow depth, are poorly imaged. \n\nFurther west these terminate abruptly towards the centre of a 200 m deep graben. Faults \n\ndefining this graben structure are clearly outlined on the sonar image, they have the \n\nsame orientation of the S. Jorge Island and present little segmentation.

Two overall \n\norientations are observable: one at N120\u00ba corresponds overall to the trend of Faial \n\nIsland and the other around N35\u00ba. Cross cutting relations between both fault system \n\nsuggest that the latter is older and currently being disrupted by the N120\u00ba one  \n\nThis area corresponds to a broad roughly circular positive free air anomaly (ca. 53 \n\nmgal) and a positive magnetic anomaly well expressed in Figure V.3, nevertheless no \n\nobvious volcanic structures are here present. The draping of the sonar image over the \n\nlower resolution bathymetry reveals some more details of this area. Despite the \n\nsignificant sediment cover, this area corresponds in fact to a circular up-lifted seafloor, \n\nabout 200m height, with a roughly flat top (Figure V.9).   \n\nGiven the positive potential field anomalies and the circular basal section of the relief, \n\nwe interpret it as possible resulting from the subsurface emplacement of a magmatic \n\ndiapir.

Magnetic inversions along strike are \n\noften visible, especially at the EPVR in the southeastern prolongation of Pico Island, \n\nwhere interaction between faulting and volcanic edifices exists at least spatially.  \n\nThe EPVR despite being a continuous morphological ridge 80 km long, is in fact a \n\ncomposite structure with an heterogeneous morpho-tectonic character (Figure V.10. \n\nFrom Pico Island Eastern tip to a point located at 27\u00ba30\u2019W, 38\u00ba06\u2019N the surface of the \n\nridge presented two slightly negative polarity areas. One of these areas defines in plan \n\nview a narrow corridor  oriented NNE-SSW, the corresponding sonar image in this area \n\ndoes not show any significant change in seafloor geology, as the top of the ridge \n\nremains a fairly continuous although heterogeneous high backscattering surface \n\nsuggesting recent volcanism. Some of this effect can be accounted for if one considers a \n\ncontext where products of a Brunhes magnetic chron eruption, overlay and cover \n\nnegative anomalies of Matuyama or older ages  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V.10 - Topographical and magnetic anomaly profiles along the EPVR. Gray shades \ncorrespond to acoustic backscatter from sonar image along the profile. Dark is low backscattering \nsurfaces, white is high backscattering surfaces. Magnetic anomaly profile is the thick white line. \nBathymetry is in meters (left axis), Magnetic anomaly in nanoteslas (right axis). Distance along \nprofile is equally in meters.  \n\n \n\n 116 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n \n\nThe second negative anomaly, on the contrary, represents a clear change in seafloor \n\ngeology (Figure V.11).  Here the seafloor is punctuated by numerous small cones \n\naligned along the LVR axis. An assertion of individual cones height was provided by \n\nsome sections of TOBI bathymetry in the inner half of the swath, where it is possible to \n\nobserve individual cones reaching 60 m high. Lack of significant sedimentation \n\nsuggests that these structures are very recent and are growing over older basement.    \n\nThe EPVR as described above terminates at 27\u00ba30W and 28\u00baN in an area of smooth \n\nbathymetry at 1400m bsl.  From this point southeastwards, the relief broadens and raises \n\nto a flat terrace at 1200 m bsl. TOBI images display a much more complex signature in \n\nthis domain (see Figure V.12).  \n\nAcoustic facies range from very low backscattering surfaces as before representing \n\npelagic/volcanic sediments in the EPVR surrounding areas; intermediate backscattering \n\nsurfaces, interpreted as volcanic terrain with probably higher sediment content \n\ndisplaying numerous faults and lineations. Areas with these acoustic facies are \n\nessentially confined to the center-left of this domain; and finally high backscattering \n\nsurfaces, the geometry of which allows its constraint as individual or composite \n\nvolcanic edifices or ridges and major fault scarps.  These are grouped essentially in two \n\nclear corridors one along the 38\u00baN parallel and the other trending ENE-WSW defining \n\nthe southern limit of the EPVR, further ENE aligned with this corridor (see Figures V.4 \n\nand V.5), two seamounts are present which express as two broad negative anomalies. \n\nTaken together this regional lineament marks the eastern end of LVR sector 2, and \n\ndeepening of Azores plateau to the east. \n\n 117 \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V.11 - Section of the magnetic anomaly map reproduced in Figure V.10, overlain over the \nTOBI sonar image. It is possible to verify the existence of numerous volcanic cones aligned along \nthe EPVR axis on negative magnetic anomaly basement. The high backscattering acoustic facies \nand the overall shape of the volcanic cones suggest that these are recent and currently active \nfeatures.  \n\n \n\nThis domain present three fault families interacting spatially and isolating depressed \n\nblocks with little or no observable deformation. To differentiate the faults families and \n\ndiscriminate more significant faults from other lineations or small fault scarps, we opted \n\nto trace representative faults in Figure V.12 with a thicker trace.  \n\nBased on their orientation range, we consider the following fault families: N140\u00ba-156\u00ba \n\n(hereafter referred to as (A)); N100\u00ba-107\u00ba (analogously as (B)); N54\u00ba-70\u00ba (C).  Finally it \n\nis worth mentioning one single fault striking N9\u00ba which seem to have regional \n\nsignificance as it separates a domain with strong positive magnetic anomalies to the \n\n 118 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \neast, probably reflecting MAR generated crust, from a western domain with very low \n\namplitude magnetic anomalies.  \n\nAnalysis of fault geometrical relations provides some constraints on the kinematics of \n\nthe different fault families. With the exception of faults belonging to (B) which seem to \n\nprevail over the others, cross-cutting relations are not clear and no prevalence of one \n\nfamily over the others seems to exist. \n\nFaults from (A) sometimes isolate semi-circular terraces limited by normal faults \n\ndipping in the same direction, these structures can be observed, both in a point at ca. \n\n27\u00ba14\u2019W, 37\u00ba57\u2019N and ca. 27\u00ba24\u2019W, 37\u00ba55.5. The S shape, in plain view, of such \n\nstructures and the prevalence of apparent normal components suggest that these are \n\noblique slips with a left lateral strike slip component. The left lateral component can be \n\nadditionally constrained by the analysis of a structure at ca. 27\u00ba30\u2019W, 37\u00ba56\u2019N, where a \n\nfault striking N148\u00ba cuts through a series of sub parallel lineaments If these are \n\nsecondary faults subsidiary of the main shear then their shape in plane view also \n\nsuggests presence of a left lateral  strike slip component. \n\nFaults belonging to family (B) define a northern deformation corridor. These faults at \n\nthat location present two broad segments with a right lateral en-echelon pattern.. This \n\ndirection is also associated to the major volcanic ridges in the sonar images. \n\nThe (C) fault family is less prevalent than the previous ones in map view, and there are \n\nno major fault scarps associated with it. Nevertheless, several TOBI sonar lineations \n\nsuggest its presence across the all domain. The most relevant fault of this system is \n\nabout 10 km long and its mid point is located ca. 27\u00ba22\u2019W 37\u00ba56\u2019N, again relation \n\nbetween this fault and minor secondary structures, especially at the westernmost \n\n 119 \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \nsections, points to some component of right lateral strike slip. Finally the same direction \n\n(as referred to above) is defined by a major SE facing topographical step, corresponding \n\nto the Eastern limit of LVR 2. To SE of it, the seafloor deepens to 2000m bsl, and high \n\nbackscatter relief\u2019s become absent. \n\nThe last LVR we shall consider in this section is located South of Terceira and will be \n\nreferred to as STVR (South Terceira Volcanic ridge). This structure is 35 km long and \n\n700 m high, and is sub parallel to the EPVR. The magnetic signature in the STVR \n\ncomprises both negative and positive low amplitude fairly uniform magnetic anomalies \n\nwith no obvious pattern of variation along strike. This is particularly relevant as the \n\nseafloor north and south of this structure presents higher amplitude positive anomalies \n\nbut no distinct morphological structures when these are compared with both sonar and \n\nbathymetric images.  \n\nIts geological character as observed from the sonar images (Figure V.13) is similar to \n\nthat of the northwestern part of the EPVR.  Aligned along the STVR axis, numerous \n\nsmall individual volcanic cones are present often displaying a small crater and \n\nsometimes linking and forming ridges which seem analogue to AVR\u2019s (Axial volcanic \n\nridges) occurring at Mid-Ocean Ridges. The ridge is dominated by volcanic processes \n\nas no clear faults are traceable from the TOBI images. The flanks of this structure are \n\nhighly degraded and present numerous slump scars, the mass wasting deposits resulting \n\nfrom this slope instability processes suffer little transport and remain confined as lobate \n\nfans at the base of the LVR. \n\n \n\n \n\n 120 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V.12 - Acoustic facies and tectonic interpretation of EPVR south-eastern termination.

All volcanic ridges imaged with TOBI sonar, regardless of their magnetic signature \n\npresent recent volcanism of fissural type aligned along their strikes. \n\n2. Sector 1 LVR seem to be overall more recent than those of sector 2, it shows more \n\nactive volcanic features and displays consistently positive magnetic anomalies along \n\ntheir strike. The LVR from sector 2 present a more complex magnetic anomaly \n\npattern sometimes masked by possible MAR generated magnetic anomalies. All the \n\nLVR studied in this chapter present a clear dominance of volcanic processes, little \n\ntectonisation is observed. \n\n3. The western terminations of sector 1 LVR display evidences of ridge propagation \n\nwestwards, these comprise graben development west of S. Jorge tip, submarine \n\nprolongation of the fissural system in Faial, more robust volcanic activity on the \n\nwestern tip of condor ridge, and widespread earthquake activity as also detailed in \n\nsection IV.3.1. \n\n4. As observed in the easternmost areas of the EPVR, the transition between LVR \n\nsectors corresponds to domains of higher tectonisation where fault families seem to \n\ndefine a somewhat irregular and complex shear zone and where essentially three \n\nfault families were recognized. \n\n5. The three fault families identified in that area are co-relatable by strike with the \n\nexpected orientation respectively of MAR transform zones and LVR1 strikes. \n\n 123 \n\n\n\n \n\nChapter V - LVR as active tectono-magmatic features of the EU-NUB plate boundary \n \n \n\nOblique faults with a possible sinistral strike slip component as those which ruptured \n\nduring the Terceira 1980 and Faial 1998 earthquakes (see section IV.4) and finally \n\nthose which correspond to secondary ruptures at nearly 90\u00ba with the previous ones \n\nduring the same Faial earthquake. The tectonic significance of these later orientations \n\nhad never been discussed in previous works until the Faial event (Dias, 2006, \n\nFernandes et al., 2002) despite their morphological signature across the plateau \n\nhaving been noted by Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998). They individualize the studied LVR \n\nsectors, and surrounding flat terraces which become deeper towards east. This \n\ndirection as we shall see in the next chapter is also recognized inland at Terceira \n\nIsland.  \n\n 124 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\n Chapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n\nVI.1 Introduction \n\nThe northern limit of the plateau consists of the Terceira rift. Its morphology is \n\ncharacterized by a series of deep rhombic to square shape basins in plane view \n\nseparating the Islands and other major volcanic constructions which express as shallow \n\nsubmarine banks. The distribution of the central volcanoes along the rift is relatively \n\nregular, with major, active edifices every 80 to 100 km (Formigas, Grande Norte, S\u00e3o \n\nMiguel \u2013 Sete Cidades, Jo\u00e3o de Castro submarine volcano, Terceira \u2013 St\u00aa Barbara and \n\nGraciosa main central volcano). Spreading centers with this characteristic spacing \n\ncharacterize the second-order segmentation of most ultra-slow to slow-spreading mid-\n\nocean ridges (Briais and Rabinowicz, 2002; Rabinowicz and Briais, 2002). It is possible \n\nthat the distribution of the recent volcanic activity along the Terceira axis reflects a \n\ncontrol of the magma feeding by mantle processes, or by melt migration processes. \n\nVogt and Jung (2003) compared the morphological characteristics of the Terceira axis \n\nwith other ultra-slow spreading systems such as the South-West Indian Ridge (SWIR) \n\nor the Gakkel ridge and classified it as an oblique, hiper-slow rift system. The Terceira \n\naxis is considered, by these authors as a young (possible&lt;1Ma) and wide oblique \n\ngraben structure disrupted and segmented by the equispaced volcanic centers. \n\n 125 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \nAs we discussed in Chapter II, the nucleation age for the Terceira axis has never been \n\ntotally constrained. Its complex magnetic structure, and lack of magnetic anomalies \n\nolder than Matuyama (Luis, et al., 1996), does not allow its classification as a fully \n\ndeveloped oceanic spreading system or otherwise as a young intra-oceanic rift system.  \n\nThe magnetic and morpho-tectonic structure of the Terceira axis, varies significantly \n\nbetween the Western half of Terceira Island and adjoining East graciosa Basin and the \n\nEastern half of Terceira Island and the North Hirondelle Basin (Figure VI.1). The \n\nseparation between these two domains is defined by the intersection of the Terceira \n\nIsland with the prolongation to NE of the limit between LVR sector 1 and 2.  West of \n\nTerceira, the Serreta ridge, disrupts the eastern flank of the East Graciosa Basin. The \n\nmost recent volcanic eruption in the Azores occurred on this ridge. East of the Island, \n\nseveral linear volcanic ridges with heterogeneous magnetic character converge into the \n\nIsland plateau and define a broad v-shape morphology. To the present day it has never \n\nbeen clear, if accretion takes place in a single or in several neovolcanic axis in this plate \n\nboundary, and, as pointed by Searle (1980), if main plate boundary processes are \n\nlocated in the bottom of the basins or associated with the linear volcanic ridges that \n\nborder them. \n\nIn this chapter we use all available altimetric/bathymetric data sources both in Terceira, \n\nthe East Graciosa Basin and the North Hirondele basin, to create an integrated Digital \n\nTerrain Model (DTM). This map is used to interprete the tectonic pattern and its \n\nvariations within the context of Terceira axis as a plate boundary. By comparing \n\nobservations from both basins and in different sectors of the Island, we aim to verify if \n\nthe tectonic observations can be explained by a single tectonic regime (i.e right lateral \n\ntranstension)  or  if  strain  is accommodated  differently  in the  domains to the west and \n\n 126 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.1.

(1998) was updated since, with other swath bathymetry data more focused around \n\nthe Terceira Island (Figure VI.2a), namely: 1) the SIRENA cruise (PI Jean Goslin) \n\nprovided a small Simrad EM300 survey gridded at 60x60m in the submarine ridge \n\nlocated southeast of the Terceira Island (SETVR). The Serreta ridge, NW of Terceira, \n\nwas mapped over the Serreta eruption area by the R/V KNORR (Voyage 161, leg 4) \n\nusing a Seabeam 2100. MARCONNI contracted a inter-Island EM12 survey for optical \n\ncable festooning and finally a EM12 transit from TRIATNORD cruise was gridded at \n\n100x100 m resoluton (Goslin et al., 1999). Island topography was retrieved from digital \n\nterrain models (DTM) from IGEOE and gridded at 30 x 30 m resolution. The resulting \n\nmap is presented in figure VI.2b. The swath bathymetry coverage is still rather limited \n\nespecially in the northern flank of the Terceira axis. It is possible to observe a sharp \n\ncontrast in the information provided by the higher resolution data sets, notably the \n\nSIRENA, Knorr and the Island DTM with respect to background bathymetric image \n\nfrom Louren\u00e7o et al., (1998).  \n\nThe map is analysed together with very high resolution (4 m x 4 m) orto-photo maps \n\ncovering the Island, to retrieve a regional lineation map.  This map comprises confirmed \n\nor possible faults and volcanic alignments and unassigned lineations retrived from the \n\northo-photo maps and from the DTM. The orientation of all digitized features was \n\nanalyzed and grouped in sets based on characteristic ranges of orientations.  Fault \n\n 128 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nkinematic constraints were interpreted based on the spatial relations between the \n\ndifferent sets and validated by direct field observations.   \n\nThe analysis of bathymetric data was complemented with geological and tectonic \n\ninterpretations provided by high resolution sonar images acquiered during the Azzorre \n\n99 cruise over the SETVR (See chapter V).  \n\nVI.3 Terceira Tectonics \n\nVI.3.1 Geological setting  \n\nThe Terceira Island is the third largest Island in the Azores Archipelago with an area of \n\n402 km2. and is approximately 29 km long in the W-E direction and 18 km wide in the \n\nN-S direction (Figure VI.3). The Island is made up of four overlapping strato-volcanos \n\nwith summit calderas, build up of volcanic sucessions ranging from basaltic to trachyte \n\nlava flows and pyroclastic deposits (Self, 1976; Calvert et al., 2006; Nunes 2000). From \n\nwest to east, the volcanos St. Barbara, Guilherme Moniz and Cinco Picos are ligned up \n\nalong a fissural system materialized by alignments of scoria and pumice cones of \n\nessentially basaltic nature following the same strike. St. Barbara is the most robust \n\nvolcano and its summit marks the highest point of the Island (1021 m).  Located to NE \n\nof St. Barbara, the Caldera of Pico Alto is a cluster of trachyte domes and short trachyte \n\nflows in close association with The Guilherme Moniz northern flank. From these four \n\npolygenetic volcanos only St. Barbara and Pico Alto are considered active (Self, 1976). \n\nThe later is considered the source for the extensive pyroclastic deposits belonging to the \n\nLages Ignimbrite covering the NE extent of the Island (Nunes et al., 2000) and which \n\nerupted some 19 to 21 Ka (Self et al., 1976; Calvert et al., 2006).   Age relations have \n\nbeen established from geological mapping (Zbyszewski et al., 1971) and volcanic \n\n 129 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \nstratigraphy studies (Self, 1976, Nunes, 2000).  K/Ar dating (Feraud  et al., 1980)  for \n\nthe top of the different calderas yield values ranging from less then 30 Ka in St\u00aa Barbara \n\nto 300 Ka at the \u201cSerra do Cume\u201d (\u201cCinco Picos\u201d).  More recently Calvert et al. (2006), \n\nperformed seven new 40Ar/39Ar on Terceira Island, there main results point to a E-W \n\nprogression in strato-volcano growth. Cinco Picos argon ages yields 370 Ka to 380 Ka \n\nfor end of volcano growth and formation of the large 7 x 9 km caldera later covered by \n\nbasalts from the fissural system. The interior of the caldera also presents some volcanic \n\ncones related with this system. Guilherme Moniz was active from 270 Ka to 111 Ka. \n\nThe vast majority of Pico Alto eruption, according to the same authors took place in the \n\ninterval between 9000 and 1000 years BP. Finaly the Argon age of 29 Ka for the St. \n\nBarbara volcano is consistent with that obtained by Feraud (1980).   \n\nHistorical eruptions have occurred associated both with St Barbara volcano and the \n\nfissural system. Hot springs \u201cfurnas de enxofre\u201d exist in the center of the Island. In 1761 \n\ntwo occurrences are documented. The event started by an explosion on the Misterio dos \n\nNegros location. East of this site, and shortly after the explosion a basaltic flow \n\ndesignated by \u201cMist\u00e9rio dos Biscoitos\u201d occurred, flowing from the fissural system along \n\nthe Northern flank of the Island (Zbyszewski et al., 1971). Other recent eruptions at the \n\ncentre of the Island and linked with the fissural system displayed an isotopic age of \n\napproximately 2115 years (Zbyszewski et al, 1971). At sea, volcanic activity has been \n\nconcentrated NW of the Island in a submarine shallow ridge striking WNW-ESE named \n\nSerreta.

Finally a set of lineations retrieved from the coupled analysis of the DTM \n\nand the ortophotomaps but which could not be assigned to either of the previous classes, \n\nduring field work are attributed to a generic unassigned lineation class (LIN). The bulk \n\nrose diagram plot of these sets lineations is presented in figure VI.5).  \n\nDespite some scatter in the plot, we verify that measured azimuths group in three main \n\ndomains: The dominant structural direction is N140-160\u00ba (12% of overall data) and \n\ncorresponds to the expression of the fissural system on the eastern side of the Island, \n\nand the en-echelon configuration of some of the individual cones within this system on \n\nthe western side, which, in turn, presents a dominant N110-120\u00ba direction (Figure VI.5 \n\nand Figure VI.6).  \n\nVolcanic lineations strike (Figure VI.5), plot over the range span of the strikes of FLT \n\nand LIN. This seems to attest the tectonic control on volcanism in this domain. The \n\nfissural system present in all extent of the island follows both N110\u00ba-120\u00ba and N140\u00ba-\n\n160\u00ba trends.  The fissural system controls the position and elongation of several cinder \n\nand scoria cones which are generally located south of the main fissural system (Figure \n\nVI.6).  \n\nA clear separation between the two fissural domains is provided by a previously un-\n\nrecognized orientation set varying between N50\u00ba to N70\u00ba (8%).

Figure VI.6 displays some of this lineations present in the SE flank of St. \n\nBarbara volcano.  \n\nThese lineations seem to be the inland continuation of the morphological set which \n\nseparates LVR1 from LVR2 sectors. They also divide the Island in two different \n\nmorpho-tectonic domains. To the East, Island topography is smooth, tectonic structures \n\nprevail, and the sole central volcano has been largely eroded and is now materialized by \n\nthe Serra do Cume and the (fault controlled?)  linear Serra da Ribeirinha. To the west, \n\nthe robust St Barbara volcano with a altitude of 1021 m dominates, eventually masking \n\nexisting faults.  The set of measured azimuths within the St Barbabra volcanic edifice \n\nreveal partially a radial pattern around the main caldera of this volcano.  \n\nIdentified Faults (Figure VI.5) trend essentially in two main directions one corresponds \n\nto the Lages graben (N130\u00ba-140\u00ba) and the other is represented by several faults east of \n\nAngra city which are dominantly in the N160\u00ba-170\u00ba azimuth  interval. \n\nWe note that some linear segments on the Island coast are parallel to these structural \n\norientations and probably represent tectonic controls on coastal erosion. Careful \n\ninspections of Island cliffs have however yielded little tectonic data.  \n\nVI.3.3  Meso-scale observations \n\nForest, extensive areas of agriculture land and the intrinsic nature of the volcanic terrain \n\nrather limits the ability to detect tectonic structures in the field.

These are briefly documented below. \n\nAdditionally it is worth mentioning a set of brittle structures associated with the onset of \n\na trachytic lava flow in the Ponta da Serreta promontory. Despite constituting a \n\nsomewhat off-topic, we opted to address them in this manuscript as an illustration of the \n\npeculiarities that can arise from tectonic studies in volcanic terrains. \n\nVI.3.3.1 The Lages Graben  \n\nThe Lages Graben, the most evident tectonic feature in Terceira Island, is a 10 km long, \n\n3.5 km wide and trends N130\u00ba. This feature may extend further SE through the seafloor. \n\nThe surface of the graben is covered by a ignimbrite deposit dated of 18 Kyr BP (Before \n\nPresent) by Feraud et al. (1980).  The Lages Graben North-Eastern bounding fault \n\n(NELF) is well expressed in topography.  The NELF in plan view presents three sinuous \n\nsegments with a tight en-echelon configuration. Further to SE, near Praia da Victoria, \n\nwithin the graben, a secondary fault is traceable from the topography and has been \n\nmapped in the Terceira Geological Map (Zbyszewski et al., 1971) \n\nEach segment displays a well defined SW facing scarp. At the tips of the segments the \n\nscarp is strongly attenuated and is retreated to its adjacent scarp traces therefore \n\ndefining bridge structures  (Figure VI.7). The bridge structures can result from 1) the \n\nen-echelon nature of the fault; 2) interaction with intersecting faults and 3) soft linkage \n\nat adjacent fault segment tips (Hossack, 1983). We were not able to verify any of these \n\npossibilities during field work. \n\nThe NELF fault zone is exposed in an outcrop on the Island\u2019s NE coast (station 1 in \n\nFigure VI.4 and VI.7). It presents a well exposed section of the fault damage zone (see \n\n 138 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nFigure VI.8). It consists on a 5 m wide zone of tectonic brecciation. Within this zone \n\ntwo clear sub-parallel fault traces are present. The SW one is sub-vertical. The NE one \n\nis a normal fault plunging about 60\u00ba to SW, which displacement defines the graben \n\nscarp.  The vertical fault plane within the NELF fault damage zone, it is not consistent \n\nwith a pure dip slip displacement for the NELF, and suggests: 1) that some amount of \n\nstrike slip component should present in that fault and 2) that the imposed strain is \n\naccommodated by slip partitioning between these two planes, one acting solely as strike \n\nslip fault and the other as pure dip-slip fault.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.7 - Contour map of the Lajes Graben .

Inset) \nOverview of hanging wall deformation.  \n\n \n\nThe hanging wall block consist on a yellowish pyroclastic infill and is disrupted by a set \n\nof closely spaced antithetic rotational normal faults which constitute the testimony of \n\nthe last increments of the NELF growth.  The infill sequence and the fault itself are \n\nsealed by a thin top layer of dark brown pyroclastic materials.    \n\n 140 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nThe SWLF fault is less well exposed. The clear step observed in topography consists on \n\na contact between a trachyte flow unit and the graben floor. We performed, where \n\npossible, a series of transects across this morphological step, normal to the possible fault \n\ntrace, which did not result in any clear fault plane identification. We noted nevertheless \n\nthat, to NE of the main morphological step, the bottom of the graben is reached by a \n\nsuccession of small step like terraces, providing faint lineations in the DTM retrieved \n\nimages and contour maps (Figure VI.4). Confirmation of these as fault related, is \n\nachieved in the western sector of the Praia da Victoria bay cliff (station 2 in Figure \n\nVI.7). Here, faults crop out and a complete geological cross section on the SW graben \n\nbounding faults is displayed. (Figure VI.9). The overall SW-NE oriented cross section \n\ndisplays a cylindrical fold in pyroclasts, with 20\u00ba deeping flanks and axial plane nearly \n\nE-W.  It is unclear if this fold is simply the result of cohesive ash fall deposition over a \n\npossible positive paleo-relief in the sub-surface or whether it results from tectonic \n\nprocesses. Further NE from the fold, a horst structure is present, defined to SW by a 60\u00ba \n\ndeeping normal fault, striking N144\u00ba (F2 in Figure VI.8), thus subparallel to the SWLF; \n\nand to NE by a fault (F1) striking N80\u00baW and dipping 75\u00ba northwards.  Analogously to \n\nthe NELF, the dips of this fault exclude them as having simple dip-slip components, and \n\nsuggest existance of some sort of strain partitioning, with presence of oblique or strike \n\nslip components. Considering the regional fault kinematics, it is conceivable that F1 is \n\nassociated with right lateral strike slip. In this case the observed fold could also form, as \n\na consequence of space problems, at the intersection between both fault systems. \n\nVerification of this hypothesis however, was not possible, as we were not able to detect \n\nany occurrence of faults to SW of the fold.  \n\n 141 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.9 -  Praia da Victoria geological cross-section displaying faults belonging to the SWELF \nsystem. \n\n 142 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nVI.3.3.2 The East Angra Faults  \n\nLocated to the North and East of Angra do Heroismo City, The East Angra faults are a \n\nset of sub-parallel faults striking N!60\u00ba to N170\u00ba (see Figure VI.4 for location of station \n\n3). These faults are well exposed in the Southern Terceira coastal cliffs (Figure VI.10), \n\nThey are expressed in the topography as tens of meters setps. In the Coastal Cliffs, we \n\ncould verify that these faults present a clear normal component. In a recent paper, \n\nNavarro et al. (in press) evaluated these faults as having a left lateral component; In \n\nfact, after the 1980 Angra do Heroismo main shock, some epicenters of the aftershock \n\nsequence layed along these faults (Hirn et al., 1980) and were probably related with \n\nsome stress transfer mechanisms (Ribeiro personal comn.). Fault plane inspection did \n\nnot yield any clear kinematic indicators. \n\nSeveral fractures following the strikes of the East Angra Faults are detected all along the \n\nEast of Angra do Heroismo coast. Some of this fractures control the installation of sub-\n\nvertical dykes, which in some cases display evidences of subhorizontal magmatic flow. \n\nAn example is presented in Figure VI.10.  \n\nTaking as a reference the produced lineation map, we consider these faults to be the \n\nsouthern prolongation of the N-S lineations observed in the Island Northern coastal \n\nareas and in the northern flank of Guilherme Moniz Cladera. The rectilinear west edge \n\nof this caldera system also suggests some control from the same fault system. We \n\nconsider that this system of lineations and faults, constitute abyssal hill fabric \n\nreactivated within the Azores stress field.  \n\n \n\n \n\n 143 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.10 - Examples of East Angra Fault traces exposed on the the Terceira southern coastal \ncliffs.

Its tectonic \n\npattern when considered as a whole is consistent with the regional tectonic stress field, \n\nhowever, in fact it translates the dynamic history of the cooling flow.  \n\n The Serreta trachytic flow (Ponta da Serreta) is several tens of meters high and is \n\ncapped by a lava clinker (Figure VI.11). Orto-photo with 0.5 x 0.5 m pixel resolution \n\nand DTM were used to constrain the lava surface structures. Structural lineation map \n\n(Figure VI.12) displays the trend of arcuate ridges, with typical wavelengths of 30 to 45 \n\nm, resulting from lava cooling and compression induced by lava gravitational flow. To \n\nthe N, a set of WNW-ESE lineations mark the right lateral sheared border of the \n\nflow.and and correspond to vertical tear faults accommodating differential movements \n\nwithin the flow. \n\n \n\nSE                                                                                                            NW \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.11 - Side view photograph of the Ponta da Serreta Spur, displaying main volcano-\ntectonic features (see text for details).  \n\n 145 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \nThe structures observed in the Ponta da Serreta seacliff are brittle to ductile shear zones \n\ndeveloping low angle frontal (synthetic and antithetic) and lateral ramps; deformed \n\ncolumnar disjunction and other brittle planar discontinuities. Ductile-brittle transition in \n\na context of progressive deformation within viscous flow is given by the deformed \n\nprisms. Flow front is characterised by brittle reverse faults and extensional fractures \n\n(Figure VI.11). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.12 - Left) Ortophotomap of the Ponta da Serreta Spur.

Flow core, \n\ncorresponding to the front of the outcropping lava lobe, presents dominantly ductile \n\ndeformation. It displays a fan like pattern of stretching lineations materialized by \n\nalignment of feldspar crystals growing upon complex magmatic foliations.  Ductile to \n\nbrittle transitions within volcanic flow are observed from either co-planar or oblique \n\ndiscrete fault surfaces developing in lava lobe outer shells and they are interpreted as \n\nincremental colder pulses postdating quasi-coeval magmatic foliations and sharing a \n\ncommon kinematic history for the entire flow unit (Figure VI.13). \n\nIdentified fault kinematic criteria are fault grooves and striations sometimes presenting \n\ncross-cutting relations, and ranging from dip slip to oblique slip both with normal and \n\nreverse components (Figure VI.13). The stereographic plot of existing fault planes and \n\nfault kinematic criteria is consistent with a local stress field generated by the gravity \n\nflow of the freezing lava (Figure VI.14). \n\nIn summary, impressive fault structures in the brittle-ductile transition can develop \n\nwithin a trachytic volcanic flow. These develop in a context of progressive deformation \n\ndue to the cooling lava. The physical similarity between such cooling induced structures \n\nand those produced by a regional tectonic stress field (as discussed by Madeira and \n\nRibeiro, 1990 and Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998) imply that interpretation of volcanic lavas \n\noutcrops from past terrains have to be evaluated in a careful manner as they might \n\nproduce erroneous tectonic interpretations.   \n\n \n\n \n\n 147 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.13 - Series of photos from the Ponta da Serreta (station 4) A) Low angle right lateral \nfault with a thrust component.

The Serreta ridge flanks are higly assymetrical. Its southern flank \n\ndeepens to the base of the East Graciosa Basin defining a slope of more than 1000 m, on \n\nthe contrary the northern flank base lies at a westward dipping slope, which follows \n\n 149 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \nroughly the same westward inclination of the Serreta ridge axis. Therefore the northern \n\nflank Serreta presents a fairly uniform height of ca. 500 m. The spatial relation of \n\nSerreta structure with the main St. Barbara volcano seems analogue of what was \n\nobserved between the Capelinhos fissural system and the Faial Island central caldera. \n\nThe axis of Serreta is well aligned with the inland fissural system, suggesting that the \n\nSt. Barbara volcano has grow over and masked it. \n\nNorthwards, sub-parallel to the Serreta ridge, two more ridges are present (Ridges 2 and \n\n3) (Figure VI.15) both with a length of approximately 8 km and an average height of \n\nrespectively 400 m and 200 m. Ridge 2 aligns with a massif trachytic flow on land,  \n\nsuggesting a structural control of the valley where this flow is present. Ridge 3 has no \n\nobvious prolongation in land. \n\nThe three main ridges present a similar morphology and are spaced at equal intervals of \n\n4 km. Despite some limitations in the areal extent of the survey, their configuration \n\nsuggests a rigth lateral en-echelon pattern along N65\u00ba.  Contrary to Serreta Ridge which \n\ndisplays a strong positive anomaly of about 1000 nT, the other two neighbouring ridges \n\npresent negative anomalies of respectively ca. -50 nT and ca. -1060 nT. If these are \n\ncontemporary features, as their morphology suggests, than they are growing on strong \n\nreversely magnetized basement of the Terceira axis. Other possibility, given their \n\nmagnetic anomalies, is that they are older features. In this case, their orientations \n\nsuggesting a fairly homogeneous stress field along recent times in this domain.  \n\nThe three ridges are formed by several segments linked together either due to bending \n\nof continuous ridge tips towards one another, or by possible splay formation from the \n\ndominate ridge segment. These linkage zones are areas of disturbed relief. In the Serreta \n\n 150 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nridge crest, linkage areas result in formation of a series of flat round or square \n\ndepressions aligned along the main ridge direction and limited overall by several minor \n\nridges. \n\nOther features present in this domain are smaller, more discontinuous ridges parallel to \n\nthe main ones, and a semi-circular depression present between ridges 1 and 2 which can \n\npossibly be a degraded small caldera arch. Near the western tip of the Serreta Ridge and \n\nalso scattered in the imaged area, numerous small elevations punctuate the sea floor, \n\nsimilarly to what have been observed west of Condor Ridge. \n\nVI.4.1.1 Serreta 1998-2001 Eruption \n\nThe 18th December 1998, after a period of some micro-seismic activity registered by \n\nthe local seismic network, local fisherman observed sea surface manifestations of a \n\nsubmarine eruption. This phenomenon, located at 38\u00ba46.8\u2019N 27\u00ba28.6\u2019W (Figure VI.16), \n\nwas confined to the ridge crest of Serreta. The beginning of the eruption was focused in \n\nthree different areas, developing later to a number of six different focalised areas. \n\nNevertheless all these manifestations were consistently aligned along a NE-SW \n\ndirection (Gaspar et al., 2003).  The eruption had constant activity throughout 1999, and \n\nlocalized emanations or micro-seismic activity have been reported in the area until \n\n2001. \n\nIt comprised plumes of smoke emanating from cooling floating lava ballons (Gaspar et \n\nal., 2003), as big as 3m in length consisting on vitreous basalt (figure VI.17). The \n\neruption was high in volatile content, as the debris normally presented empty cavities \n\nformed by gas accumulations, at the surface. As cooling occured, seawater entering \n\nthrough the cracks and gas liberation promoted plunging or sometimes explosion of the \n\n 151 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \ndebris (floating time: 15 minutes in average). This eruption was not continuous; it \n\npulsed between periods of moderate activity and others of relatively quietness with total \n\nlack of volcanic activity at the sea surface.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.15 - Model depicting possible tectonic interpretation for the Serreta Ridge Area. Ridges \nwould act as dominantly tension cracks with possibly a minor right lateral component. Shear \ncomponents would be largely accommodated in N150\u00ba faults and N65\u00ba transfer zones. \n\n 152 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nDuring the 500 years of human settlement in Azores, a significant number of submarine \n\neruptions have already occurred, sometimes evolving into ephemeral Islands (a \n\ncomplete synthesis of Azores eruptions may be found in the paper of Weston (1964). \n\nThe eruption site was very close to the location of other submarine eruption which \n\noccurred in the year of 1867. The later was preceded by premonitory tremors that lasted \n\nfive months culminating with violent earthquakes and explosive volcanism that lasted \n\nonly a week and produced damage in the Terceira Island. On the contrary, the Serreta \n\neruption has lasted for longer time and seems to have been much more effusive in \n\ncharacter and, given the geometry of the sea-floor manifestations, of a fissural nature.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.16 - Bathymetric/altimetric map of Terceira Island and East Graciosa basin.

The pre-eruption survey displays an ortogonal \u201cbay\u201d \n\nlike relief which interrupts the Serreta ridge crest. This bay is open southwards. The \n\nmost significant change in the topography at the eruption site, is visible in the post \n\neruption survey as that \u201cembayment\u201d is now closed into a square section depression and \n\nthe Serreta ridge becomes a continuous feature. Despite the different resolutions of the \n\nsurveys, profiles from both surveys, across this new feature, yield sufficient bathymetric \n\ncorrelation on the sections off the eruption location to allow characterization of \n\nbathymetry change. The profiles suggest that the eruption probably started a a depth of \n\naround 450 m bsl and created a continuous relief about 120 m high, overall. The slope \n\nof the southern flank probably became steeper as suggested by the profiles. The \n\norientation of the newly formed ridge does not match the reports of NE-SW but \n\nobservation suggest that some leakage from a NNE-SSW ridge east of it but in close \n\nproximity might have occurred (Gaspar et al., 2003) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.17 \u2013 Left) photograph of a \u201clava ballon\u201d sample.

The orientation of the main morphological features, changes drastically when \n\ncompared to the Serreta domain or to the western part of the Island, but is consistent \n\nwith the observations on its eastern side. \n\nThe transition form NHB to the South Hirondelle Basin (SHB) defines a step in \n\nmorphology which orientation corresponds to the prolongation northeastwards of the \n\neastern transition from LVR sector 2 to deeper areas (see section V.3). The Jo\u00e3o de \n\nCastro Bank, a shallow (~13 m bsl) caldera system lies over this probable tectonic limit.  \n\nFrom the gathered swath bathymetric data, we only have a profile, which crosses the all \n\nextent of the Terceira axis, perpendicularly to it.  The profile is located at the \n\nnorthwestern limit of the NHB (see Figure VI.1 for location).  Its analysis, combined \n\nwith magnetic data, provides some constraints about the Terceira axis major morpho-\n\nstructural features (See Figure VI.19). From Northeast to Southwest the transition from \n\nthe abyssal plain into the Azores plateau is defined by an asymmetric ridge. The \n\nnorthern flank of this structure is about 900 m high defines the edge of the plateau (we \n\ndesignated it as ER \u2013 Edge of plateau Ridge). The southern flank of this structure is \n\nabout 300m high and bounds a 400 m depression elongated parallel to the Regional \n\nTerceira axis strike. This graben like basin (hereafter called ED \u2013 Edge of the plateau \n\nDepression) lacks any significant seismo-tectonic activity but presents nonetheless high \n\nmagnetizations, in the order of those observed further SE in the seismically active \n\nportion of the Terceira axis.  The single passage of swath bathymetry reveals that the \n\nfloor of this depression is disrupted by normal faults striking N130\u00ba-140\u00ba (n= 9) parallel \n\nto the ER, and two volcanic cones about 200 m high are partially imaged. \n\n 156 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.19 -  Series of profiles performed over a single passage of EM300 swath bathymetry data \nacross the Terceira axis (see Figure VI.1 for profile location).  Based on their morpho-tectonic and \nmagnetic signature several domains have been identified: SETVR -SouthEast Terceira Volcanic \nRidge; NHB \u2013 North Hirondelle Basin; East Terceira Volcanic Ridge (positive); East Terceira \nVolcanic Ridge (negative anomalies \n\n \n\n 157 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \nThe following topographical high, here referred to as the East Terceira Volcanic Ridge \n\nRidge (ETVR), shows two distinct areas based on the orientation of tectonic structures \n\nand its magnetic character. The first of these areas tends to have negative or near zero \n\nmagnetizations and corresponds to a rough surface deepening towards East. Normal \n\nfault scarps imaged by the single passage confined to this areas of low magnetization \n\nhave a distinctive orientation from the previous ones, as they strike between N110\u00ba and \n\nN114\u00ba (n=4). Volcanic structures are absent.  Further Southwest the ETVR becomes \n\nstrongly positive (locally in the profile it reaches ca 7 Am/m) and dominated by \n\nvolcanic processes. This is confirmed, as we shall see below, by the far NE portion of \n\nthe Sirena bathymetric map and the AZ99 TOBI mosaic, where in the prolongation of \n\nthis domain towards SE, numerous volcanic cones cover deeper portions of the NHB \n\n(see Figure VI.2 for spatial reference).   \n\nThe NHB, in this profile is bound between the ETVR and the Southeast Terceira \n\nVolcanic Ridge (SETVR). In pratice, it prolongs towards the Terceira Island as a V-\n\nshaped depression, where its apex, at around 300 m bsl, defines the geometrical \n\nconvergence between both marginal ridges.  \n\nVI.4.3 The SouthEast Terceira Ridge (SETVR) \n\nThe amount of data over this ridge, either from swath bathymetry from Sirena I cruise  \n\n(Louren\u00e7o et al., 2003) and the TOBI mosaic that was performed during the Azzore99 \n\ncruise (Ligi et al., 1999), makes one of the most documented submarine structures in the \n\nAzores apart from the Islands themselves. For instance GLORIA images from Searle \n\n(1980) see Figure VI.20, would only provide a hint on the high level of tectonic \n\ndeformation here present, and in terms of regional bathymetry, (as observable in Figure \n\nVI.2) despite reproducing the overall shape of the ridge, it does not provide any \n\n 158 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nindication at all of relevant tectonic features. These data on the SETVR proofs the \n\nimportance of having a wider swath bathymetric coverage of the Azores Plateau. \n\nThe ridge presents a NW-SE orientation, it is seismically active (see Figure VI.1) and \n\ncorresponds mainly to Brunhes magnetic epoch. The bathymetry and sonar maps reveal \n\na clear partition between tectonic processes, centred in the ridge, and volcanism present \n\nat the bottom of the North Hirondelle basin.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTerceira\n\nGloria Sonar (1980)\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.20 - Gloria sonar image from Searle, (1980), over the SETVR. Red square indicates the \narea now covered with both TOBI and EM300 swath bathymetry. \n\n \n\n 159 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \nThe acoustic facies interpretation from TOBI is presented in Figure VI.21. We have \n\ndefined essentially 5 different acoustic facies: Clusters of bright linear, or otherwise \n\nlinear acoustic shadows (for faults facing away from sonar ensonification direction), are \n\nclassified as tectonic terrain, polygons of faults identified within this domain were \n\ndigitized. High to medium backscattering surfaces, with irregular textures sometimes \n\nforming hummocks or with identifiable conic or with basal circular sections have been \n\nclassified as volcanic terrain. If a significant number of faults were present disrupting \n\nbright backscaterring surfaces, these domains were classified as tectonised volcanic \n\nterrain. Sediment terrain corresponds to areas of homogeneous low backscatter. Finally, \n\nmaking additional use of swath bathymetry to help interpretation process and define \n\nmore sharply the base of the ridge, areas of talus deposits and mass wasting deposits \n\nwere mapped. In the first case, outlined by narrow bands, at the base of fault scarps, \n\nwith variable degrees of backscatter, characteristic of talus deposits. Corrugations in \n\nsediment facies in the dowdip direction and flanking fan like shapes in plan view, \n\ntypical of slump deposits (Figure VI.22-3) were indistinctly classified as mass wasting \n\ndeposits. \n\n The SETVR axis is a broad high backscatter surface of volcanic nature, given its high \n\namplitude magnetic anomaly. All the areal extent of the ridge is disrupted by a strand of \n\nsub-parallel but highly anastomosed normal faults striking between N130\u00ba and N150\u00ba.  \n\nAt 27\u00baW, 38\u00ba25N, in the SW ridge axial flank, a distinct rhombic shape topographic low \n\nis present, defined by a continuous low backscattering sedimented surface which \n\ncorrelates with a negative magnetic anomaly. This low is fault controlled in its Southern \n\nand Northern limits. Its Eastern and Western flanks, correspond to sharp N-S contacts \n\n 160 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nbetween low and high backscaterring surfaces, which are cut through, by faults \n\nbelonging the same dominant fault system in the SETVR.  \n\nThe top of the SETVR consists on an arched demi-.horst, and it is interpretable either as \n\nvolcanic structure remnant (caldera system?), existing prior to onset of the tectonic \n\nstage in the ridge or otherwise a giant scar from the gravitational collapse of the \n\nnortheastern flank. Both ridge flanks display gullies and mass wasting fans at the base \n\nof the slope (Figure VI.22-3). The ridge vicinities are almost exclusively composed of a \n\ngrayish homogeneous acoustic facies interpreted as pelagic and volcanic sediment. The \n\nnumerous untectonized volcanic cones, present to NE, in the northern flank of the North \n\nHirondelle basin (see Figures VI.19 and VI.22-1), form alignments sub-parallel to the \n\nridge main strike and contrast with the densly fractured pattern observable in the \n\nSETVR. The high magnetization values observed in the areas covered by this volcanic \n\nconstructs suggests that this is the current neo-volcanic axis in this domain. Limited \n\ndata, limits our ability to constrain its areal extent along the plate boundary. \n\nFaulting geometries their inter-relationships and fault orientations, in the SETVR, \n\nprovide clues concerning their kinematic behaviour. Some faults present horse-tail \n\nterminations. Fault splays often link to neighbour faults defining extensional duplexes \n\n(Figure VI.22-2), relay ramps and fault wedge basins and highs of roughly rhombic \n\nshape (see Figure VI.22-4). These faulting patterns observed in the SETVR are \n\nconformal with right lateral oblique extension component. Typical wrench structures \n\nlike strike slip pull-apart basins are not observed in this domain.  \n\n \n\n \n\n 161 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.21 \u2013 Top) TOBI mosaic of the SETVR.

In Figure VI.23 we present a tectonic model that \n\nsummarizes our main observations. West of Terceira, volcanic accretion seems confined \n\nto the Serreta ridge, expressing as fault controlled fissural volcanism. The East graciosa \n\nbasin floor is barren in volcanism and clear cut tectonic structures, nevertheless a left \n\nlateral strike slip  N150\u00ba faulting direction is bound to play a significant role in the plate \n\nboundary strain accomodation. Linkage of bathymetric observations with inland data is \n\nstraight forward for the Serreta ridge as the submarine prolongation of the fissural \n\nsystem inland, clearly expressed between the Guilherme Moniz and St. Barbara \n\ncalderas.  \n\nThe Island of Terceira displays a complex tectonic pattern where four tectonic \n\ndirections were recognaized often controlling volcanic cone morphology, dikes, lava \n\nflows paths and possibly same sections of the coast line. These are according to strike:  \n\n1) WNW-ESE. Corresponding to the fissural system in the Island west of Guilherme \n\nMoniz Caldera.  Possibly corresponding to tension fractures with some minor rigth \n\nlateral displacement provided by the en-echelon arrangement of individual cones \n\nelongation axis. \n\n 164 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n2) N-S. Expressed by the East Angra faults; interpreted as possible reactivation of MAR \n\ngenerated fabric. This system ruptured as left lateral Strike slips in the 1980 Terceira \n\nearhquake.   \n\n3) NNW-SSE. Expressed by the Lages Graben and the Cinco Picos Caldera fissural \n\nsystem. Co-existance of vertical and 60\u00ba dipping fault planes belonging to this fault \n\nfamily suggest that some strain partitioning should exist associated with it. \n\n4) ENE-WSW lineation family. These devide the Island in two halfs with distinct \n\nmorphologies. Volcano-tectonic orientations also denote the clear change in orientation \n\nof the fissural system between the Island western and eastern halfs. Furthermore as \n\ndiscussed in Chapter V, this fabric seems to have a regional significance related as a \n\nrelay zone parallel to the opening direction between AF (Nub) and Eurasia as \n\nconstrained by NUVEL1A kinematic model. \n\nThe seafloor structure East of Terceira displays a higher magnetic and morpho-\n\nstrucutural complexity than the submarine domain west of it. The linkage of submarine \n\nobservations with the East of the Island is less clear mainly because of data availability \n\nlimitations.  \n\nThe Lages Graben follows the same strike as the SETVR pervasive faulting. In SETVR, \n\nthe faulting pattern seems dominanted by right lateral oblique extension. Faulting on the \n\nETVR follows a strike close to the Island fissural system. The observed active \n\nsubmarine fissural volcanism is concentrated in a region parallel to the SETVR but \n\nlying deeper and between this two ridge systems. Furthermore consistent high \n\nmagnetization values and lack of tectonization leeds us to the conclusion that this \n\nfissural volcanism materializes the neo-volcanic zone in the submarine domain east of \n\n 165 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \nTerceira Island. Linkage of these submarine volcanic occurrences with those of Cinco \n\nPicos Caldera, fissural system inland, cannot be verified and probably they are a part of \n\ndifferent accreting segments. \n\n \n\nFigure VI.23 -  Summary of main tectonic observations in the study area. Ligth gray contours are \nshallow area. Dark gray contours are deep bathymetric areas. Dash gray lines are axis of negative \nmagnetic anomalies considered abandoned accretion units. Short dashed black lines are positive \nmagnetic anomalies considered volcanically inactive. T labels refer possible timing sequence for \nactivity of those acretion units, where T0 refers to the present day. Black line defines the Terceira \naxis neo-volcanic zone. Long dashed lines mark the SE limit of sector 1 LVR hypotetised as \ncorresponding to a relay zone. Stippled lines are possible MAR related reactivated fabrics. Arrows \nindicate interpreted bulk sence of displacement in the fault. West of relay zone, faults probably \naccommodate deformation by deformation partition. East of the limit faults are considered to \npresent oblique dextral slip. \n\n \n\nConsidering these observations, and assuming that the bulk of inter-plate tectonic \n\nprocesses are focused in the Terceira axis in this sector, how is accretion accommodated \n\nin this domain? Is it full seafloor spreading or is intra-oceanic rifting still taking place as \n\nsuggested by Vogt and Jung (2003)? \n\n 166 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nExistance, both in the Island and in the SETVR of N-S striking fault segments and the \n\npoint source style of volcanism which resulted in the construction of the Island, \n\nprobably at the intersection of tectonic structures (Self, 1976; Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998) \n\nleads us to the conclusion that Terceira axis \u201cbasement\u201d can be in fact tectonically \n\nsubsided MAR generated seafloor due to rifting of lithosphere resultant from EU-NU \n\nplate boundary processes without effective seafloor spreading. We envisage, therefore \n\nthat the extremely slow nature of extension within the Terceira axis, has resulted in \n\nvertical stacking of volcanic products along main active tectonic trends. The Brunhes \n\nand Matuyama magnetic anomalies, documented within the Terceira axis would \n\nrepresent the last volcanic expression within that system. In this case, the spatial \n\narrangement of magnetic anomalies within the Terceira axis, and the main orientation of \n\nthe principal volcano-tectonic features, can provide some clues on the sucession of \n\nmagmatic and tectonic accretion events and their spatial distribution across this plate \n\nboundary.  \n\nSearle (1980) stated that it was unclear form the studied GLORIA images, if the plate \n\nboundary corresponded to the topographical highs or lows.  Considering the strike of \n\nfaults imaged on the ETVR subparallel to the Western Terceira Island fissural system \n\nstrike and its overall orientation, we consider that this must have been initially a single \n\naccreting segment and the older one (See also section II.2.6), probably corresponding to \n\nreactivation of a MAR transform (axis at T-3 time in Figure VI.23). Magmatic activity \n\nessentially ceased in Matuyama age. The ER follows the same strike of the ETVR and \n\npresents a similar magnetic anomaly character suggesting that it has been active during \n\nthe same T-3 period.The timing for ED generation is also unclear. Probably it was \n\nformed in a recent time (axis at T-2 time?) and active volcanism and minor earthquake \n\n 167 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VI - Tectonics on the Terceira Island and neighbouring basins \n  \n \nactivity suggest that is still an active feature, despite never having evolved fully to a an \n\nacretion axis. Activity then jumped into the SETVR resulting in the construction of this \n\nridge by volcanic processes (at T-1 time). Subsquently as extension proceeded volcanic \n\nprocesses get focalized in the southeastern edge of the ETVR, materialising the present \n\nday acretion axis (T0 axis). All the across axis domain, notably the SETVR and ETVR, \n\nundergo mainly concomintant oblique extension.  \n\nWe interpret these clokwise jumps in accretion axis as the result of two conjugate \n\nfactors:  \n\n1) Variations in the thickness of the lithosphere brittle layer. As magmatic processes \n\nproceed, progressive topography build up and therefore increase in load as well as \n\ncrustal thickness, could lead to a re-organization of the magmatic plumbing system and \n\nreactivation of subparallel pre-existing structures but in a thinner and weaker brittle \n\nlayer, therefore more favourable to rupture as volcanic conduits \n\n2) The prevailing kinematic conditions through time. As referred in Chapter IV, the \n\nextension at this plate boundary has progressively rotated from NE-SW to more E-W \n\ndirections (as constrained respectively by Nuvel-1A and by GPS models). This \n\nmodification of kinematic constraints could have resulted in changement of the tectonic \n\nregime from right lateral transtension dominated by wrenching, still prevailing in the \n\nstudied western domain to oblique right lateral extension in this eastern domain. In the \n\nlatter with consequent reactivation of NW-SE left lateral faulting directions as oblique \n\nnormal faults. We suggest that the Terceira axis neovolcanic axis, at least in this sector, \n\nis re-organizing and fitting the current kinematic conditions. \n\n 168 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nChapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption \n(Faial) \n\nVII.1 Introduction  \n\nGeodetic monuments were installed for the first time on Faial Island in 1937. Fifty years \n\nlater they were reoccupied with triangulation and trilateration and, just before the 9 July \n\n1998 earthquake, they were once again observed, now with GPS instruments. In spite of \n\nthe significant volcanic and seismic events during this period, a quantitative assessment \n\nof the Island\u2019s deformation has never been attempted. In this section, we summarise the \n\nresults of re-processing of geodetic data covering a time span of 60 years, to assess the \n\nlong-term deformation pattern of the Island recently presented as a form of a paper \n\n(Catal\u00e3o et al., 2006). We show that displacements are large over the western part of \n\nFaial Island, and mainly limited to the 1937-1967 period; in the eastern part of Faial \n\nIsland the displacement field is below the accuracy threshold of conventional geodetic \n\ntechniques for the whole time span. Most of the Island deformation, as we shall discuss \n\nbelow, probably was accommodated in a single event, corresponding to the 1957 \n\nCapelinhos eruption and subsequent earthquake activity. This unique data allows \n\nconstraining the dynamics of active volcanic processes and how they contribute to inter-\n\nplate deformation at the Azores. Its generalization also provides clues on modes of \n\ngrowth of the LVR at least for sector 1.  \n\n 169 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption (Faial) \n \n \n\nVII.2 The eruption and associated earthquake activity \n\nSince the arrival of the first settlers, in the early XV century, several aerial eruptions \n\nhave been reported in most of the Islands. Faial Island in particular was the site of a few \n\nhistorical eruptions; the last one and the best described is the Capelinhos eruption. This \n\neruption started on the 27th of September 1957, 1 km offshore the western tip of Faial \n\nIsland. During about 1 month (until 30 October) intensive explosive activity was \n\nobserved, with uninterrupted emission of bombs and scoria. A small Island was formed, \n\nbuilt up with tephra and basaltic lapilli reaching 600 m in diameter on the base and a \n\nheight of 80 m above sea level. On the 30th October the explosive volcanic activity \n\nceased and the Island collapsed. Subsequent activity led to the construction of an ash \n\narc, which reached 150 m height in 1958. Contact between the active chimney and \n\nseawater was responsible for the high explosive character of the eruption in the first 7 \n\nmonths of the eruption. There is a large photographic survey and many written \n\ninformation concerning this eruption (Castello-Branco et al., 1959, Machado, 1958a, \n\n1958b, 1959a, 1959b, Machado et al., 1959, Machado et al., 1962, Zbyszewski et al., \n\n1959). \n\nOn May 13th, 1958, there was a readjustment of the volcanic edifice inducing a seismic \n\ncrisis with more than 450 events recorded. In some places macroseismic intensity \n\nreached X, in the Modified Mercalli scale (Machado, 1959a). Three source areas were \n\nidentified: one immediately southwest of the central caldera, other northwest, at half \n\ndistance between the caldera and the active crater. The focal depth was estimated by \n\nMachado (1959a) to be approximately 1 km. A series of fractures was observed with \n\nsubsidence parallel to the N105 cinder cones alignment and uplift along sea cliffs. A \n\nlong narrow belt parallel and along the north side of the cinder cones was depressed \n\n 170 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nduring these crises (Machado et al., 1962). These shallow events had low magnitudes, \n\nas they were not felt on the SE of Faial (Machado et al., 1962). There are no records of \n\nthese earthquakes because there were no permanent seismographs in the Azores. \n\nActivity ceased on 24 October 1958. The seismic information is poor: only 3 seismic \n\nstations were installed in the Azores, one at S. Miguel (since 1902) another at Faial \n\n(since 1902) and the third at Terceira (since 1932). Faial was inoperative at the time of \n\nthe eruption and a new seismograph was installed at Horta during the crisis. \n\nTopographic changes were noticed and several surveys conducted to evaluate their \n\nmagnitude (Machado et al., 1959). Most of the measurements were limited to the \n\nCapelinhos area and devoted to volume computation. Machado et al. (1962) describes \n\nsignificant height changes in the south and west of the Island as a result of whole event. \n\nChanges reached 0.5 m uplift in Vale Formoso (see site VFOR on figure VII.1 for \n\nlocation) and 1.5 m subsidence along pre-existing faults, in the central area of Faial. \n\nSome quantitative data referred by Machado et al.

Their network covers the whole of Faial and \n\nPico Islands.

Faial is the western Island of the \ncentral group that is closest to the Mid-Atlantic Rift. The Capelinhos volcano is located on the coast \nin the westernmost part of the Island. Geodetic network on Faial and Pico (triangles), directions \nand azimuth between Faial and Pico measured in 1937 and Electronic Distance measurements \n(EDM) made in 1967. \n\n \n\nThis network was built in 1937- 1942. It is based on well-cemented pillars, about 1.2 m \n\nhigh, set firmly into the ground. The network covers the whole surface almost uniformly \n\nwith a local cluster around the Faial summit crater. The network has been surveyed to \n\nthe best available standards of the time in six different operations since 1937, as shown \n\nin Table VII.1.  \n\nFive different types of observations were made: triangulation, trilateration, azimuth, \n\nlevelling and GPS. Two global occupations have been made, in 1937-1942 and 1995-\n\n1997, giving a time span of about 60 years between the first, made with traditional \n\nmethods, and the second, with GPS. In Faial, intermediate observations were made in \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n1967, with several distances measured with an electro-optical device; in the 1987 \n\ncampaign, the Faial geodetic network was almost completely observed with directions \n\nand zenith distances (planimetry and altimetry). \n\nCatal\u00e3o et al. (2006) evaluated triangulation, trilateration and GPS measurements \n\nobtained in the Islands of Faial and Pico between 1937 and 1997 and estimated the total \n\ndisplacement field for a set of 58 points well distributed over both Islands. Their full \n\ndata exploration strategy and processing schemes description is out from the scope of \n\nthis work, for more details the reader is refered to Catal\u00e3o et al. (2006).

First, \n\nfor each epoch and each Island, they obtained the geodetic parameters (coordinates) \n\nloosely constrained to the MMOC site from terrestrial observations and GPS data. \n\nSecond, he compared distance observations made in 1967 with computed distances \n\n 173 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption (Faial) \n \n \nderived from single epoch solutions constraining the deformation process in time. In the \n\nthird and last step, loosely constrained single epoch surveys were combined into a single \n\nsolution which general constraints in position and velocity were imposed, reducing all \n\nobservations and parameters into a uniform reference frame.  \n\nThe projected distances were compared with the computed distances derived from each \n\nsingle-epoch network adjustment and are presented in Figure VII.2 as a function of \n\ntime. Distance measurements made in 1967 at some sites on Faial, show large baseline \n\nvariations before 1967 and moderate or null variations after that, suggesting no \n\nsystematic trends related to any secular relative deformation between these sites. The \n\nmain ground deformation is confined to the period 1937-1967 and is most probably the \n\nresult of the Capelinhos eruption and associated volcanic and tectonic ground \n\ndeformation processes. In this case, derived site velocities may be interpreted as mean \n\nvelocities integrated over time, and as a consequence are dependent on the chosen \n\ninterval range.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VII.2 - Line length less a constant nominal length plotted as a function of time.

Orthometric heights were determined purely \n\nby trigonometric heighting for most of the geodetic vertices. The starting point was the \n\nMMOC site with its known true orthometric height determined by conventional \n\ndifferential levelling from the tide gauge. A set of 36 sites are common in both epochs \n\nand the vertical deformation was computed for each site, from which a vertical \n\ndeformation contour map was derived and presented in Figure VII.3.   \n\n \n\nFigure VII.3- Vertical deformation obtained from 1937 and 1987 epochs (Catal\u00e3o et al., 2006) \n\n \n\nThe first thing to note from this map is the almost perfect agreement between \n\nneighboring sites producing an almost smooth surface, and showing a high spatial \n\ncoherence of these movements.

From the north flank of \n\nthe Faial crater spanning the entire north coast of Faial, a vertical uplift of 1.0 m is \n\nobserved with a maximum of 1.5 m on the north crater flanks. \n\nFinally, the single-epoch observations were integrated by Catal\u00e3o et al. (2006) into a \n\nmulti-temporal adjustment to derive the deformation field in the period 1937-\n\n1997.There are two possible intervals: 1937 to 1987, with only conventional geodetic \n\ndata, and 1937 to 1997 with conventional geodetic data and GPS. Catal\u00e3o et al. \n\nprocessed both periods and two sets of displacements were derived, corresponding to \n\nthe 1987 and 1997 epochs. Both solutions were compared and it was found that residual \n\ndisplacements between them were within the 95% confidence error ellipses. In Figure \n\nVII.4, the computed displacement for the 1937-1987 period with 95% confidence \n\ninterval ellipses is depicted. This period has more common sites than 1937-1997 due to \n\nthe network reconstruction in 1997. \n\nIt is important to note that the resulting displacement field for the Faial-Pico network \n\nhas been found in the joint solution of conventional and GPS geodetic observations in a \n\nframe of reference attached to the MMOC site in the south-east of Faial Island, which \n\nwas strongly constrained in position and velocity in the adjustment of the geodetic \n\nnetwork. This was the only strong constraint. This means that the computed \n\ndisplacements between 1937 and 1987 are relative to the MMOC site. \n\n \n\n \n\n 176 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\n 177 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VII.4 - Displacements obtained from simultaneous adjustment of the 1937 and 1987 geodetic \nnetworks.

Dyke \n\nemplacement was simulated by a set of rectangular tensile dislocation sources in an \n\nelastic, homogeneous and isotropic half-space (Okada, 1985). The medium is assumed \n\nto have rigidity equal to 30 GPa. Inversion was made using the non linear generalized \n\ninverse algorithm developed by Briole et al. (1986), which allows the estimation of fault \n\nand slip parameters that best fit geodetic data. We first used field data reported by \n\nMachado et al. (1962). For the inversion, all three components of the displacements \n\nwere used. The parameters for each rectangular dislocation model are length, width, \n\n\n\n \nChapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption (Faial) \n \n \nstrike and geographic location of the centre of dislocation plane at its top, as well as dip-\n\nslip, strike-slip and opening dislocations.

(1962) descriptions of the May \n\n1958 seismic crisis. In the inversion process we constrained the geometry of the \n\ndislocations sources to follow the surface traces of eruptive fissures and invert for their \n\ngeometry, kinematic solutions and location. Four plane sources were used. Fault planes \n\n 178 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nlaying along the fissural system west of the summit caldera were constrained to be \n\nessentially pure opening; the other two fault planes sub-parallel to the previous ones, \n\nlocated north and south of the system were constrained respectively as dominantly \n\nnormal fault dipping south, with a minor right lateral shear component, and dominantly \n\nnormal fault, dipping northward, with a minor left lateral component. These can be \n\nviewed as the collapse of the caldera, corresponding to the May 1958 seismic crises. \n\nSource parameters obtained from inversion are presented in Table VII.2 and their \n\nprojection on the horizontal plane is shown in figure VII.5.  \n\nReduced chi-square was determined from the network adjustment (12 cm for the \n\nhorizontal components). The ? 2 / n values obtained after adjustment were 0.98 \n\nassuming the aforementioned uncertainties. A misfit of 1.0 indicates that the data errors \n\nare statistically consistent with the residuals. In this case the goodness of the fit is very \n\npromising and we have a reduced chi square almost equal to 1 considering the a \n\nposteriori 12 cm standard deviation for latitude and longitude displacement components. \n\nThe mean square error for the best fitting model is 14.5 cm in longitude and 13.8 in \n\nlatitude, implying there is still un-modelled signal. This model explains 94% of the \n\nplanimetric displacement but only 42% of the vertical displacement. The misfit is \n\nscattered throughout the network, showing residual local vertical displacements that we \n\ninterpret as block falling that cannot be modelled by a simple elastic model. The model \n\nfits the summit and northwest subsidence rather well and also the large horizontal \n\ndisplacements along the coast. However, it underpredicts the uplift on the north flank. \n\n \n\n \n\n 179 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VII - Geodynamic inferences of 1957-58 Capelinhos Eruption (Faial) \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure VII.5 - Map of the displacements obtained from the measured geodetic network (directions \nand distances). Blue arrows are the observed displacements and the red arrows are the \ndisplacements computed from the forward rectangular source model with four rupturing elements. \n\n \n\nThe horizontal displacements show rapid seaward displacement in the north and south \n\nflanks with a scattered behavior over the caldera. The greatest displacements occur \n\nalong the north coast. The velocity pattern around the summit is clearly influenced by a \n\nlocal source of deformation displacing all summit points to the west. This pattern is \n\nconsistent with a dike intrusion near the summit caldera. Stations on the north flank \n\nshow significant uplift of about 1 m. There is a dramatic decrease in the displacements \n\nin the south-east of Faial that correlates well with the normal fault system of Flamengos \n\ngraben. The displacements in this region and on Pico Island are almost within the \n\nconfidence error ellipses, indicating a non-deformated area consistent with the \n\ntrilateration observations made in 1967 and the GPS observations from 1997. In fact the \n\n 180 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \neruption and the subsequent seismic crises did not affect either the east of Faial nor Pico \n\nIsland. \n\nMost of the deformation is spatially constrained to the central and western zones of \n\nFaial Island. Northern and western stations have average displacements of 1.5 m \n\n(relative to MMOC), while stations on eastern Faial and Pico show no significant \n\nrelative motion. It is known (Machado et al., 1962) that the eruption and associated \n\nseismic crises were hardly felt in Pico, this is confirmed by the geodetic data therefore \n\nno significant deformation has affected Pico Island since 1937. \n\nVertical displacements show subsidence of the north-west zone with a maximum of -1.5 \n\nm and coastal uplift on the south-west zone with a maximum of 0.5 m. This uplift along \n\nthe south coast constrains the fault position and argues in favour of normal faulting \n\nalong this fault. There are three stations with significant subsidence along the north-\n\nwest coast. \n\nAs we have only a few occupation epochs during the whole time span we cannot \n\ncompletely discriminate the time variation of the displacement field. However, we know \n\nthat displacements were smaller than the accuracy of conventional geodetic techniques \n\nduring the 1967-97 period, and also that the magnitude of the displacements deduced \n\nfrom our work agree well with the independent measures presented by Machado et al. \n\n(1962) for the deformation generated by the 1957-58 events. We can conclude that \n\nsurface displacement observed between 1937 and 1997 is mainly a consequence of a \n\nsingle series of events related to the Capelinhos dyke emplacement event and related \n\neruption as suggested by our modeling procedure. \n\n \n\n 181 \n\n\n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\n \n\nChapter VIII - Physical models of rifting and transform faulting in a \nwedge-shape lithosphere \n\nVIII.1 Introduction \n\nMost of the physical processes that must be evoked to support tectonic interpretations in \n\nthe Azores are not well understood as in the case of rifting and transform fault \n\ngeneration. In the Azores mantle processes which contribute for the formation of rifting \n\nin the Terceira axis and transform fault generation can be driven both by plates \n\ndivergent spreading and by the Azores Hot Spot dynamics in space and time. As this \n\ninteraction between the Azores Hot Spot and Azores lithosphere is not yet fully \n\nunderstood, physical modelling as shall be presented bellow is a usefull tool to provide \n\nconstraints on the relevance of some of those factors. In this chapter we disregard plume \n\nrelated mantle processes and foccus our attention in ridge push as a driving force for \n\nortogonal transform fault generation and for spreading to occur. \n\nThe way in which mantle processes contribute to plate tectonics has long been a subject \n\nfor debate. After more than 30 years of studies of oceanic ridges, several objections \n\nwere raised to the early views in which plate motions are fundamentally a result of \n\nmantle convection (Cox &amp; Hart, 1986) and lithospheric plates ride passively on a \n\nmoving asthenosphere. Molnar (1988) considered that flow in the asthenosphere is no \n\n 183 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \nmore than a trigger for plate motion. Davies (1992) suggested that plates govern the \n\nflow and that they are integral parts of the convection process. More radically, St\u00fcwe \n\n(2002) calculated that differential stresses at the base of the lithosphere are too small to \n\ntransmit forces from the asthenospheric mantle to the lithosphere. On petrologic \n\narguments, he also concluded that the ascending paths of convective cells are not \n\ndirectly under oceanic ridges. \n\nThere is growing support for the idea that tectonic plates are active components of \n\nglobal convection. According to this view, plate tectonics are an example of self-\n\norganization (Anderson, 2001 and 2002), whereby forces at the edges of plates directly \n\ninfluence processes in the convecting mantle. The recognized forces are ridge push, slab \n\npull, trench suction and basal drag (see Turcotte and Schubert, 1982). Balancing them \n\nare shearing, slab bending, friction on transform faults, and continental collision (e.g. \n\nForsyth and Uyeda, 1975; Richter, 1977; Chapple and Tullis, 1977, Cox &amp; Hart, 1986, \n\nFavela and Anderson, 2000). \n\nFirst order oceanic transform faults tend to be geometrically simple; on the whole they \n\nare parallel to plate motions, disturbed only by significant changes in kinematic \n\nconditions (Fox and Gallo 1984 and 1986; Carbotte and Macdonald, 1994; Hey et al., \n\n1995). Non-transform discontinuities also exist, but they are ephemeral, and result from \n\nlocal interactions (MacDonald, 1986 and 1988; Grindlay et al, 1991; Grindlay and Fox, \n\n1993).  Transform faults that strike at 90\u00ba to adjacent ridge segments are common in \n\nnature, for example in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge south of the Azores, the Hayes and \n\nOceanograper Fracture Zones display such a configuration. Within the ATJ domain, \n\nthere are no clear first order transform linked with the Eu-Af plate boundary, however \n\nwe have here presented reported co-seismic ruptures in orthogonal planes, as shown by \n\n 184 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nFaial 1998 earthquake, and orthogonal geometrical relations is fault patterns namely in \n\nthe East of Terceira Island and adjoining North Hirondelle Basin or across the LVR \n\nsectors. These geometrical relations are not accountable from classical theories of \n\nfracture mechanics.  \n\nIn this chapter, we investigate the structures that are formed in ridges, straight or offset. \n\nThe presence of a heavy wedge-shaped lithosphere above a buoyant asthenosphere leads \n\nto isostatic compensation, forming ridges and abyssal plains. The topography of the \n\nridge results in ridge push. This is a driving force for extension on the ridge, as well as \n\nfor transform motion at ridge offsets. \n\nVIII.2 Background on physical models of ridges and transform faults \n\nPhysical modelling has been successful to some extent in reproducing ridges and \n\ntransform faults. Oldenburg and Brune (1972, 1975) obtained good likenesses, using \n\nparaffin wax as a model material. They concluded that equivalent structures in nature \n\nresult from tensile forces that originate through buoyancy forces acting in plates, rather \n\nthan through underlying viscous drag.  \n\nO\u2019Bryan et al., (1975) published results based on the wax model of Oldenburg and \n\nBrune, and the Cox \u201ctennis ball experiment\u201d (Cox, 1973).  They produced realistic ridge \n\nand transform geometries and suggested that transform faults orthogonal to the ridge \n\nwould result from upward propagation of a zigzag pattern at the base of the lithosphere \n\nor top of the asthenosphere. Ragnarsson et al. (1996) used similar wax models to \n\naddress ridge dynamics and structure. They concluded that, above a critical spreading \n\nvelocity, a transient segmented ridge and orthogonal fracture zones form.  \n\n 185 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \nShemenda and Grocholsky (1991, 1994) used a wax-like hydrocarbon, forcibly cooled \n\nfrom above, to simulate both melt and a semi-brittle upper layer subject to horizontal \n\ntension.  In their experiments, a ridge resulted from an unstable, non-stationary and \n\nasymmetric three-dimensional process. They were not able to produce orthogonal \n\ntransform faults, but rather transfer zones, which grew in width or ceased to be active as \n\na function of adjacent ridge dynamics.  \n\nDauteuil and Brun (1993) used analogue models consisting of brittle and ductile layers \n\nto study the structural pattern of the highly oblique Mohns Ridge. Mart and Dauteuil \n\n(2000) used similar layers, isostatically compensated, to model obliquely rifting \n\nsystems. In both sets of experiments, the resulting fault pattern included en-echelon \n\nridges, normal to the extension direction, and intervening zones of oblique strike slip. \n\nMauduit and Dauteuil (1996a and 1996b) and Dauteuil et al., (2002), using isostatically \n\ncompensated two-layer models of sand and silicone putty, altered the lithospheric \n\nstrength in the transform zone. The resulting fault zones were narrow, when the \n\nlithosphere was strong; and wider and more complex, when the lithosphere was weak. \n\nIn nature, Dauteuil et al. (2002) concluded that spreading rates and offset lengths are the \n\nmain factors controlling lithospheric strength at transform faults.  \n\nTentler (2003) used centrifuged models, in which up-rise of lighter and weaker ductile \n\nmaterial (an analogue for the asthenosphere) promoted passive rifting in an overlying \n\nbrittle layer. In some experiments, propagating cracks interfered longitudinally and \n\ndeveloped into \u201coverlapping spreading centres\u201d. Tentler (2003) suggested that such \n\noverlap might lead to orthogonal ridge-transform configurations in true mid-oceanic \n\nridges. \n\n 186 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nNone of the above analogue modelling strategies has focussed specifically on the \n\ninterplay between gravitational forces, rifting and the generation of transform faults \n\nbetween offset spreading segments. To do so we must investigate the problem by means \n\nof physical models in which the driving forces for the development of axial rifts are \n\ngravitational in origin. They come from density jumps at a dipping interface, rather than \n\nfrom a convecting mantle. Although in nature the role of heat is essential, in that it \n\ngoverns the thickness of a cooling lithosphere, we do not model its conduction or \n\nadvection. Instead, we assume that, as a result of cooling and spreading, the lithosphere \n\nis a wedge of small apical angle. We test the mechanical response of such a wedge and \n\nthen of an offset between ridge segments. In some experiments, the offset is purely \n\ngeometrical, whereas in others we have reduced the frictional resistance by using \n\nartificially embedded faults. The underlying question is, can gravitational forces explain \n\nthe common occurrence of major oceanic transform faults, which are orthogonal to \n\nadjacent ridge segments? \n\nVIII.3 Dynamics of a spreading oceanic lithosphere \n\nThe oceanic lithosphere can be considered as a thermal boundary layer and its base as \n\nan isotherm. To calculate the shapes of isotherms, we follow Turcotte and Schubert \n\n(2002): if the oceanic lithosphere cools in the same way as a semi-infinite half-space, its \n\ntemperature at a time t is given by (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982, equation 4-113, page \n\n160): \n\n(T \u2013 Tm)/(Tm \u2013 Ts) = erf {z/2(? t)1/2}       (1) \n\nIn equation (1), the terms on the left and right are dimensionless, T is the current \n\ntemperature at the base of the lithosphere, Tm is the temperature deep in the \n\n 187 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \nasthenosphere (in other words, the original temperature, before cooling), Ts is the \n\nsurface temperature (which we assume to be constant), z is the depth (in mm), ? is the \n\nthermal diffusivity (in mm2 s-1), t is the age of the lithosphere (in s), and erf is the error \n\nfunction. \n\nIf the lithospheric wedge moves at a steady velocity u in a horizontal direction x, then t \n\n= x/u and equation (1) becomes the parametric equation of a parabola (Figure VIII.1). \n\nFor Tm-Ts = 1200 \u00baK, u = 3 cm/yr and ? = 1 mm2 s-1, the lithospheric segment that \n\nformed between 10 Ma and 35 Ma is up to 86 km thick and has an average basal slope \n\nof about 3\u00ba. As the lithosphere moves away from the ridge, it cools, and its density ? \n\nincreases in the following way (Turcotte and Schubert 1982, equation 4-173, page 179): \n\n??  = ? ? ? d?          (2) \n\nHere ?? is the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion. For an initial mantle density \n\nof ?m = 3.3 x 103 kg m-3, a constant coefficient of ?  = 3 x 10-5 \u00b0K-1, an initial \n\ntemperature of 1480 \u00b0K, and a final temperature of 280 \u00b0K, the final lithospheric density \n\nis ?l ? 3.4 x 103 kg m-3. \n\nAs the lithosphere becomes heavier, it requires support. If isostatic compensation occurs \n\nin the asthenosphere, the theoretical depth w of the ocean is (Turcotte and Schubert, \n\n1982, equation 4-202, page 182): \n\nw = 2 ?\u00b5 ? {(?m ? ??)/(?m ?  ?w)}  (?x/? u) 1/2      (3) \n\nHere ?w is the density of seawater. According to this equation, the depth of the ocean \n\nincreases with the square root of the distance from the ridge axis. The result is in good \n\nagreement with most observations. \n\n 188 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VIII.1 - Thickness of oceanic lithosphere in nature and experiment.

Segment of triangle (grey polygon) is approximation to true shape, \nfor lithosphere between 10 Ma and 35 Ma. Basal slope is 3\u00b0. In experiment (bottom), sand has same \ntriangular shape and basal slope. \n\n \n\nThe elevation of the ridge establishes a pressure head, or ridge push, which drives \n\nhorizontal motion of the lithosphere. The process can be thought of as gravitational \n\nsliding. The lithospheric plate slides downward along the slope between the ridge crest \n\nand the adjoining ocean basin. By assuming that the weight of the lithosphere causes \n\nequal horizontal and vertical stresses (in other words, a true pressure) and by balancing \n\nthe horizontal forces, we may predict the ridge push (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982). It is \n\nthe resultant of three forces (F1, F2 and F3, Figure VIII.2A). The first (F1) results from \n\npressure in the asthenosphere and is equal to the depth-integrated pressure (F5) acting on \n\na vertical plane. The second (F2) results from pressure in seawater and is similarly equal \n\nto a depth-integrated pressure (F4). The third (F3) is due to the weight of the lithosphere.  \n\n \n\n 189 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \n\n 190 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VIII.2 - Theoretical subsidence and ridge push in nature and experiment. In nature (A), \nsubsidence w is due to variable thickness (yL) and density (?L) of lithosphere, as well as density of \nseawater (?W) and asthenosphere (?A). Ridge push is resultant of horizontal forces (F1, F2 and F3) \nacting on lithosphere. In experiment (B), air replaces seawater, lithosphere is triangular segment of \nsand, and asthenosphere is of PDMS. Subsidence equals one half of lithospheric thickness. Ridge \npush is resultant of horizontal forces (Fl and Fa) acting on lithosphere. For further details, see text.  \n\n \n\nThe resultant ridge push F on the lithosphere becomes (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982, \n\nequation 6-376, page 288):  \n\nF  = g ?m ? (?m ? ??) {1 + 2 ?m ? (?m ? ??)/ ? (?m ? ?w)} ?t    (4) \n\n \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nHere g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m s-2). According to equation (4), the \n\nridge push is directly proportional to the horizontal distance from the ridge axis, and \n\ntherefore to the age of the lithosphere. For a density of water of ?w = 1.0 x 103 kg m-3, a \n\ntemperature difference of 1200 \u00b0K, and values of the other parameters as before, the \n\ntotal ridge push on an oceanic lithosphere, which is 100 Ma old, is ca. 3.8 x 1012 N m-1 \n\n(Turcotte and Schubert, 1982, page 288). This is a force per unit length, parallel to the \n\nridge. On a lithosphere that has moved at 3 cm/yr for a distance of 1050 km, so that it is \n\n35 Ma old, the ridge push is ca. 1.4 x 1012 N m-1.  \n\nIf the only stress that balances the ridge push is a horizontal shear stress, acting on an \n\narea (1050 km by 1 m) at the base of the lithosphere, its magnitude is ca. 1.3 x 106 Pa. If \n\nthe viscosity of the asthenosphere is 1020 Pa s (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982), the \n\ncorresponding rate of shear beneath the lithosphere is ca. 1.3 x 10-14 s-1. If the plate \n\nvelocity is 3 cm/year (ca. 1 x 10-9 m s-1), and if this attenuates linearly with depth, it \n\nmust do so down to at least 130 km. As this depth is conservative for the asthenosphere, \n\nwe conclude that the ridge push is sufficient to cause plate motion. Any excess ridge \n\npush is available for causing a longitudinal stress gradient in the lithosphere or for \n\ndriving strike-slip motion on transform faults. \n\nVIII.4 Model configurations and scaling \n\nAll the experiments (except Model B) were done in a wooden box, 2300 mm long, 500 \n\nmm wide and 150 mm deep (Figure VIII.3). Thin sheets of transparent polyester \n\n(Mylar) covered the walls. At the two ends of the model were motor-driven L-shaped \n\npistons, 90 mm high and 500 mm wide. They rested and could slide on end walls, 60 \n\nmm high and 1500 mm apart.  \n\n 191 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VIII.3 - Experimental configuration (in schematic oblique view). Models consist of only one \nspreading ridge (A), or of two spreading ridges (B) and one orthogonal vertical offset (VO). Model \nlithosphere (sand) rests on model asthenosphere (PDMS). \n\n \n\nThe model materials were (1) dry quartz sand from Fontainebleau, France, for the \n\nlithosphere and (2) transparent silicone polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), for the \n\nasthenosphere. These materials are readily available and their properties are well \n\nknown. The sand yields according to Coulomb criterion: the angle of internal friction is \n\nabout 40\u00b0 and the cohesion is negligible (see Mourgues and Cobbold, 2003). The PDMS \n\nis a Newtonian fluid and its viscosity is about 104 Pa s.  \n\nOur models took no account of heat advection, thermal contraction, or consequent \n\nvariations in density. Instead, the density of the model lithosphere was constant, as was \n\nthat of the model asthenosphere. The density of the sand was approximately 1.5 x 103 \n\n 192 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nkg m-3 and that of the PDMS was about 1.0 x 103 kg m-3. Thus the density ratio was 1.5 \n\n- far greater in the models, than it is in nature. As we shall see later, this high viscosity \n\nratio led to abnormally high values of isostatic subsidence and ridge push. \n\nWe did seven experiments, in two basic layouts: (1) a single symmetric ridge with no \n\noffset (models A, C and D; Table VIII.1 and Figure VIII.3A), and (2) two ridge \n\nsegments, trending N-S and offset E-W, with or without an embedded fault (models E, \n\nF and G; Table VIII.1 and Figure VIII.3B). \n\n \n\nTable VIII.1.

From nature to model, all stresses necessarily scaled down \n\nby a factor of ?r = ?r Lr. Taking ?r ? 0.45 for the lithosphere, and Lr ? 7 x 10-7, we obtain \n\na stress ratio of ?r ? 3.2 x 10-7. In nature, the viscosity of the asthenosphere is of the \n\norder of \u00b5 = 1020 Pa s. As the viscosity of the PDMS is of the order of 104 Pa s, the \n\nviscosity ratio for our experiments was ?\u00b5r = 10-16. From this and the stress ratio, the time \n\n 193 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \nratio was tr ? 3.1 x 10-10 (1 second in an experiment was equivalent to about 100 years \n\nin nature; 100 hours were equivalent to about 37 Ma).Thus the velocity ratio was ur = \n\nLr/tr ? 2.3 x 103 (0.13 mm/minute in an experiment were equivalent to 3 cm/year in \n\nnature). Finally, because ridge push has dimensions of N m-1, its model ratio, in \n\nprinciple, was Fr = ?r Lr ? 2.2 x 10-13. In practice, the ridge push was abnormally high in \n\nthe models, as will be explained later.  \n\n \n\nTable VIII.2.

The height of the PDMS was 100 mm at the ridge \n\naxis and it decreased linearly to 60 mm at the end walls. A layer of Fontainebleau quartz \n\nsand was laid over the PDMS and its upper surface was scraped horizontal. The \n\nthickness of the sand wedge was therefore ca. 55 mm against the pistons and ca. 15 mm \n\nat the ridge axis (except in models C and D, where it was ca. 20 mm and 10 mm, \n\nrespectively). The model wedge, on each side of the ridge, was 750 mm long and 500 \n\nmm wide, representing a prototype wedge that was 1050 km long, 700 km wide and up \n\nto 86 km thick. In cross-section, the wedge was triangular and its apical angle was close \n\n 194 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nto 3\u00b0. This was a simplification that made it easier to construct the models. The \n\nunderlying PDMS represented an asthenosphere, 164 km deep. \n\nIn a matter of minutes after construction the shape of the model changed as a result of \n\nisostatic compensation. At the axis, where the heavy lithosphere was relatively thin, the \n\nupper surface rose. On the flanks, where the lithosphere was thicker, it sank. However, \n\nat the lateral boundaries, the lithosphere did not move, because it was in dry frictional \n\ncontact with the sidewalls and end walls.  Nowhere did the model asthenosphere have \n\nthe opportunity to extrude, as a result of the pressure that the heavy lithosphere exerted \n\nupon it. \n\nFor ideal isostatic compensation of a perfectly triangular wedge, the subsidence w is \n\ndirectly proportional to the thickness h of the model lithosphere and to the density ratio: \n\nw/ h = ?l/?a ? 1          (5) \n\nIn a perfectly triangular wedge, where the density is 1.5 x 103 kg m-3 for the lithosphere \n\nand 1.0 x 103 kg m-3 for the asthenosphere, the theoretical subsidence is one half of the \n\nlithospheric thickness. In our models, which were segments of triangular wedges, the \n\ntheoretical subsidence was w ? 27.5 mm at the far end, and w ? 7.5 mm at the near end \n\n(Figure VIII.2B). Thus the theoretical relief was 20 mm, representing an abnormal value \n\nof almost 30 km in nature.  \n\nIn a perfectly triangular wedge, the ridge push F is equal to the difference between the \n\nvertically integrated pressures in the asthenosphere (Fa) and the lithosphere (Fl): \n\nF  =  Fa - Fl  =  g ?a?? h + w  z dz - g ?l ??? h  z dz  = (g/2){?a (h + w)2 - ?l h2}   (6) \n\n 195 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \nSubstituting equation (5) into equation (6), we obtain, for the theoretical ridge push on a \n\ntriangular wedge: \n\nF  = (g/2) (?l /?a) (?l ? ?a) h2         (7) \n\nFor the same densities as before and for a wedge segment, the ends of which are 55 mm \n\nand 15 mm thick, the estimated ridge push at the far end is ca. 10.3 N m-1. However, in \n\nour models it may have been smaller than that, because sidewall friction impeded full \n\nisostatic compensation. \n\nBecause ridge push has dimensions of N m-1, it should scale down by a factor of Fr = ?r \n\nLr ? 2.2 x 10-13. As the ridge push in the prototype is ca. 1.4 x 1012 N m-1, in the model it \n\nshould have been ca. 0.3 N m-1. The estimated value (10.3 N m-1) was about 30 times \n\ngreater, partly because of the triangular shape of the model lithosphere, but mainly \n\nbecause of the abnormal density contrast and consequent topographic relief. \n\nVIII.4.2 Models of offset ridges \n\nIn the second layout (models E, F and G), the ridge was offset vertically and \n\northogonally (Figure VIII.3B). To construct the models, the PDMS surface was shaped \n\ninto two N-S ridges. The amount of offset was 300 mm. The ridges were asymmetric, \n\nthe apical angles being ca. 2.2\u00ba for the short flank and ca. 5\u00ba for the long flank. These \n\ndimensions were for convenience in constructing the models. However, they meant that \n\nthe lithospheric thickness was over-estimated on the short flanks and underestimated on \n\nthe long flanks. \n\nThere were three variants to the layout (Figure VIII.4). \n\nIn Model E, there was a vertical offset, but no embedded fault (Figure VIII.4A). \n\n 196 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nIn Model F, there was an embedded fault, consisting of two Mylar sheets and an \n\nintervening thin glass plate (Figure VIII.4B). The Mylar sheets spanned the distance \n\n(300 mm) between the two ridge segments. Downward, they penetrated no more than 5 \n\nmm into the PDMS. Upward, they reached into the sand as much as 5 mm above the \n\nridges. The glass plate was also 300 mm long, but it reached the bottom of the box. \n\nIn Model G, there was an embedded fault, consisting of two longer Mylar sheets, but no \n\nintervening glass plate. One end of each sheet was at a ridge axis, whereas the other end \n\nwent well beyond the other ridge axis (Figure VIII.4C). Between the ridges, the Mylar \n\nsheets were in mutual contact, whereas beyond the ridges they were in contact with \n\nPDMS or sand. \n\nThe Mylar sheets were in dry frictional contact, with each other (Model G), with the \n\nglass plate (Model F) and with the sand. Although for these contacts we did not measure \n\nthe frictional resistances, we observed that they were less than the internal friction of the \n\nsand. In contrast, all materials adhered strongly to the PDMS. In Model F, the glass \n\nplate rendered the embedded fault inflexible. \n\nIn a matter of minutes after construction, the shape of the model changed, as a result of \n\nisostatic compensation. At the ridge axes, where the heavy lithosphere was relatively \n\nthin, the upper surface rose. On the flanks, where the lithosphere was thicker, it \n\nsubsided. At the lateral boundaries, the lithosphere did not move, because it was in dry \n\nfrictional contact with the sidewalls and end walls. For similar reasons, uplift was less \n\npronounced along the trace of the ridge offset, than it was on the ridges or their \n\nimmediate flanks.  \n\n \n\n 197 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \n\n 198 \n\nFigure VIII.4 - Three initial kinds of transform fault in models (top views and side views). In Model \nE ridge has vertical offset and there is no embedded fault (A). In Model F, embedded fault consists \nof two flexible Mylar sheets and one intervening thin glass plate (B). In Model G, Mylar sheets \nextend beyond offset and there is no glass plate (C). All interfaces are in dry frictional contact, \nexcept against PDMS.  \n\n \n\nVIII.5 Experimental results \n\nVIII.5.1 Model A. Half-ridge, unconfined gliding, sidewall friction (Figure VIII.5). \n\nIn Model A, the lithosphere consisted of a single ridge flank. As long as the end walls \n\nprovided confinement, the lithosphere did not move. However, when the experimenter \n\nremoved part of the wall, at the far end of the box, the lithosphere glided down slope. \n\nAs a result, normal faults formed in the axial region (Figure VIII.5). However, the sand \n\nwas in dry frictional contact with the plastic sidewalls and the PDMS adhered to them \n\nstrongly. This lateral resistance resulted in shear zones, containing Riedel faults. \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nTo reduce the sidewall friction, we fixed four Mylar sheets (Mylar 1, Figure VIII.6) to \n\nthe end walls, in such a way that they ran along the sidewalls. Another four Mylar \n\nsheets (Mylar 2) were fixed to the sidewalls, but in lower positions, so that they partly \n\noverlapped the upper sheets. On withdrawing the end walls and the attached upper \n\nMylar sheets at a constant rate of 20 mm/hr, we found that no shear zones developed \n\nagainst the sidewalls. \n\nVIII.5.2 Model B. Unconfined gliding, no sidewall friction. \n\nModel B was built outside the apparatus, on a rigid plate dipping at 3\u00b0. The model \n\nconsisted of a triangular wedge of sand, resting on a layer of PDMS, 3 cm thick. All \n\nlateral boundaries were free. Under its own weight, the lithosphere glided down slope. \n\nThe experiment lasted one hour. \n\nThe upper part of the model glided slowly, whereas the lower part glided more rapidly. \n\nAs a result, the entire model was subject to extension. The velocity at a point in the \n\ncentre of the model increased slowly, up to a value of about 120 mm/hour (Figure \n\nVIII.7). \n\nVIII.5.3 Models C and D. Straight ridges, confined gliding, limited sidewall friction \n\nIn models C and D, a piston moving at 10 mm/hour limited the rate of gliding of the \n\nmodel lithosphere. The result of gliding was extension in the ridge axis (Figure VIII.8). \n\nWhen the extension had reached 1%, an axial rift formed. To avoid the PDMS welling \n\nup unduly and to simulate the formation of oceanic crust by cooling, we deposited thin \n\nlayers of sand episodically in the axial rift. The thickness of this sand exerted a strong \n\ncontrol on the development of extensional faults in the axial rift. \n\n \n\n 199 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VIII.5 - Unconstrained gliding and effect of sidewall friction, Model A.

Early faults soon \n\nbecame inactive and new faults took over from them, but the pattern remained irregular. \n\nIn Model D, the thickness of sand in the axial rift reached 20 mm. Extensional faults \n\nwere sharper and more regular in strike. The amount of slip on the faults was also \n\ngreater. In the early stages of deformation, two major faults were active, defining a \n\nvalley. Later, these faults rafted out and became inactive. New faults formed on the \n\nridge axis, where the extension concentrated. Thus the final result was a series of \n\nparallel normal faults, of which only the innermost ones were active.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VIII.7 - Displacement versus time for unconfined gliding, Model B.

Offset ridge, no embedded fault  \n\nIn model E the ridge was offset laterally by 300 mm. However, there was no embedded \n\nfault. As before, normal faults formed along the axis of each ridge segment (Figure \n\nVIII.9). Normal faults propagated towards the offset trace (OT), curving into it, and \n\nparallel to the topographic gradient. A broad transform zone (TZ) developed. Initially, \n\nthe zone contained two left-lateral Riedel faults, at 17\u00b0 to the offset trace. These \n\ndeveloped into normal faults, bounding oblique transform valleys. At ca. 0.7% of axial \n\nextension, a left-lateral strike-slip fault formed almost at right angles to the ridge axis \n\n(arrow, Figure VIII.9). However, the entire transform zone continued to be active and it \n\nremained oblique to the offset trace. The structures were typical of a trantensional \n\ncontext and did not resemble a sharp transform fault, as occurs in nature. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VIII.8 - Progressive development of ridge, models C and D (no offset). Photographs (from \ntop) show four stages in development of relief.

Offset ridge, rigid planar embedded fault (Figure VIII.10). \n\nIn Model F, the embedded fault consisted of two Mylar sheets and an intervening glass \n\nplate. The fault was therefore rigid and inflexible, but it allowed slip. At ca. 5.1%, 6% \n\nand 7.2% of axial extension, sand was added to depressions in the transform zone \n\n(Figure VIII.10). \n\nIn the initial stages of the experiment, two axial rifts formed, as before. However, this \n\ntime the rifts propagated as far as the offset trace, remaining straight. At about 0.6% of \n\naxial extension, a narrow transform zone appeared, on one side of the offset trace, and at \n\nabout 79\u00ba to the ridge axis. It contained two left-lateral faults. At about 5% of axial \n\nextension, the southern fault propagated eastward, intersecting the outer bounding fault \n\nof the axial rift (arrow 1, Figure VIII.9), whilst the northern fault splayed and \n\npropagated westward. A pure left-lateral strike-slip fault (arrow 2, Figure VIII.9) cut \n\nacross the transform zone. At ca. 6.7% extension, a new oblique-slip fault (left-lateral \n\nnormal) formed on the northern side of the transform zone (arrow, Figure VIII.9, 6.7% \n\nextension). Thus the transform zone became straighter, but it remained oblique to the \n\noffset trace. Again, the structures were typical of trantension, as in Model E.  \n\nVIII.5.6 Model G. Transform with long flexible embedded fault \n\nIn Model G, the embedded fault consisted of two Mylar sheets but no glass plate. The \n\nfault was therefore inextensible but flexible. \n\n In the early stages of the experiment two axial rifts formed as before. Again, they \n\npropagated as far as the offset trace, remaining straight. However, this time a single, \n\ndiscrete fault formed along the offset trace, at right angles to the ridge axis (Figure \n\n 203 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \nVIII.11A).

Such a kinematical \n\nconfiguration is typical of transform faults in nature (Figure VIII.11B) \n\nVIII.6 Discussion \n\nVIII.6.1 Straight ridges \n\nIn the experiments, horizontal ridge push resulted in lithosphere gliding and the \n\ndevelopment of axial rifts. It is likely that ridge push caused a component of horizontal \n\ncompression, which was insufficient to generate reverse faults, but sufficient to obstruct \n\nthe formation of extensional structures, other than the axial rifts. Thus the experiments \n\nyielded realistic structures and kinematics, which were closely comparable to those in \n\nnature. \n\nIn the experiments, both the magnitude of the ridge push and the velocity of gliding \n\nwere an order of magnitude too large, as compared with the values obtained from \n\nscaling. The exaggerated values were almost certainly due to the strong contrast in \n\ndensity between model lithosphere and asthenosphere. Despite these exaggerations, the \n\nexperiments confirmed that ridge push is capable of (and sufficient for) driving plate \n\nmotion and generating axial rifts. There is no need to invoke other forces, coming for \n\nexample from thermal convection in the asthenosphere. However, this does not mean \n\nthat some such additional forces do not exist in nature.  \n\n 205 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \nIn the experiments, the shapes of the axial rifts depended on the thickness of sand.  \n\nWhere the axial sand was thin (so that the asthenosphere was shallow), the ridge was an \n\narea of distributed extensional deformation, where bounding faults were short-lived and \n\nhad small scarps; where the sand was thick, the axial rift was straight and wide, and the \n\ntwo bounding faults were long-lived, taking up most of the extension and developing \n\nprominent scarps. On the Mid-Atlantic ridge, faults have a similar pattern (Shaw and \n\nLin, 1993), which has been interpreted as a function of the thermal regime. In cold \n\ndomains at the ends of ridge segments, the lithosphere is thick and strong, and faults are \n\nlong- lived. In contrast, at the segment centres, where the lithosphere is weaker and \n\nthinner, faults are closely spaced and short-lived, and they have smaller displacements.    \n\nThere are several explanations for abyssal hills on ridge flanks (see Edwards et al., 1991 \n\nand references therein). Amongst the possible structures are half-grabens, resulting from \n\nblock tilting.  \n\nIn Model D, fault blocks rafted away from the active axial domain and became tilted, \n\nbetween faults dipping toward the ridge axis. Thus Model D accounts well for the \n\nstructural fabric of abyssal hills in nature. \n\nVIII.6.2 Offset ridges \n\nIn Model E, where the thickness of the lithosphere was offset and the ridge push acted \n\nin opposite senses on each side, why did a transform fault not form at 90\u00ba to the ridge \n\naxis? We suspect that various factors worked against it. First, the amount of isostatic \n\nuplift was smaller at the offset ends of the ridges, than it was elsewhere along them. \n\nTherefore the ridge push must have attenuated toward the offset trace. Second, the \n\n 206 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VIII.10 - Progressive development of a transform zone, Model F (offset ridge, planar rigid \nembedded fault).

Initial ridge offset was \n300 mm.  \n\n 207 \n\n\n\n \nChapter VIII \u2013 Physical Models of rifting and transform faulting in a wedge shaped lithosphere   \n \n \nmodel lithosphere was as strong along the offset trace as it was elsewhere. Therefore the \n\nshear force due to ridge push may have been insufficient to cause failure in strike-slip \n\nmode, parallel to the offset trace. In contrast, transtensional failure along an oblique \n\ntransform zone, linking the more uplifted segments of the ridges, may have occurred \n\nmore readily. \n\nIn Model F, where a rigid planar fault was embedded within the ridge offset, why did a \n\ntransform fault not form at 90\u00ba to the ridge axis? We suspect that the reasons are similar \n\nto those for Model E. Even though the embedded fault was potentially less resistant to \n\nslip than the non-ruptured sand, we believe that transtensional failure on an oblique \n\ntransform zone occurred more readily than strike-slip along the embedded fault. That \n\nthe oblique zone formed to one side of the offset trace, instead of crossing it, may have \n\nbeen because the glass plate was rigid. The reduction in available space may have \n\nforced the transform zone to form at a higher angle to the ridge than it did in Model E. \n\nIn Model G, the Mylar sheets slipped readily but they were inextensible. No oblique \n\nzone could crosscut them; but why did one not form to the side, as in Model E? We \n\nsuspect that isostatic uplift occurred all along the ridges, as far as the embedded fault, \n\nwhich may have slipped vertically at that stage. This may have happened all the more \n\nreadily that the embedded fault reached well onto the outer flanks of the ridges. Thus \n\nthe resulting relief may have been more similar to what it is in nature, where it forms \n\nincrementally. Once the relief was of the required shape, the distribution of ridge push \n\nmay have been sufficient to cause slip on the embedded fault. \n\n 208 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VIII.11 - Progressive development of transform zone, Model G (offset ridge, flexible \nembedded fault).

In particular, the \n\nresistance to slip along transform faults is considered to be extremely small (Zoback, \n\n1991). However, the reasons for this are not entirely clear. Various possibilities have \n\nbeen suggested. \n\n The coefficient of internal friction is smaller in the fault gouge than it is in the wall \n\nrock (Parsons, 2002). \n\nAs a result of fluid overpressure (Byerlee, 1990) or seepage forces (Mourgues and \n\nCobbold, 2003), the effective stresses in the fault zone are smaller than they are outside.  \n\nTransform faults form at the onset of cooling and they remain weak, as a result of \n\nthermal contraction (Collette, 1974; Turcotte, 1974). \n\nA biaxial stress field promotes extension and fault unlocking in a direction parallel to \n\nthe ridge axis (Zoback, 1991; Gudmundsson, 1995). \n\nLong-term interaction with other faults (\u201cfault unclamping\u201d) reduces the normal stress \n\non a transform fault (Parsons, 2002). \n\nPresence of serpentinites within the principal transform displacement zone or at ridge \n\ntransform intersections (Escartin et al., 1997, Hirth et al., 1998, Escartin et al., 2001b). \n\nOur experiments do not provide any clues as to which of these potential mechanisms \n\noperates in nature. However, the experiments do indicate that transform faults must be \n\nweaker than the surrounding oceanic lithosphere. \n\n 210 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nChapter IX \u2013 Discussion and main conclusions \n\nThe Azores are a region subject to a unique geodynamic setting in the world, it \n\ncomprises: An area of anoumously thick oceanic crust expression of a non-conventional \n\nHot Spot, an unstable triple Junction, geometrically and kinematically complex, and a \n\nplate boundary which displays the slowest spreading rate in the world ridge system.  \n\nDuring the course of this work, we analysed the spatio-temporal variability of the large \n\nand small scale processes which interact in the Azores domain, these can be broadly \n\nsystematized as ATJ-AHS for large spatio-temporal scales (Plateau scale) and in \n\nseismo-tectonic and volcano-tectonic events for smaller spatial working scales (Islands \n\nand surrounding deeps) at the present day. \n\n For the large scales, we discussed possible scenarios of interaction between the ATJ \n\nand the AHS through time as described independently by different authors for the \n\nkinematic evolution of the Azores. We focused on interpreting possible tectonic \n\nscenarios for the generation of the plateau main morpho-tectonic features, and study \n\npossible positions and tectonic natures of the ATJ along a time span comprising the age \n\nintervals: 33 Ma to 20 Ma; 20 Ma to 10 Ma and 10 Ma to present. \n\nFor the smaller temporal scales we used multidisciplinary data with different resolution \n\nto gain insights on the dynamics of the volcano-tectonic systems in the Azores. We \n\n 211 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IX \u2013 Discussion and main conclusions \n \n \napproached the Terceira axis as a spreading system and we studied its behaviour with \n\nrespect to GPS derived kinematics. Two configurations for the Terceira axis \n\nsegmentation were tested by means of elastic half space dislocation modelling. The \n\ndetailed tectonics of Terceira Island and some insights on the morpho-structure of \n\nneighbouring segments was achieved, using mainly the conjugate analysis of side scan \n\nsonar images, magnetic charts and when available detailed swath bathymetry data. \n\nFinally, we considered seismo-tectonic and geodetic data and results from a recent \n\nseries of volcanic and tectonic events to constrain how magmatic accretion couples with \n\nfar-field tectonic regimes interact in the Azores domain.  \n\nOur main conclusions can be summarized as follows: \n\nIX.1 ATJ Evolution \n\nThe existence of a kinematic independent Azores domain seems to have occurred long \n\nbefore the interaction of the Azores plateau with the AHS, and is at least older than C13 \n\n(33.4 Ma). An estimation of the tectonic character acting through the plateau at different \n\ntime intervals varies according to the kinematic model choosen but yield transtension or \n\noblique extension as the most favourable tectonic regimes along the time span \n\nconsidered. This result is supported by the poor ATJ closure obtained using published \n\nkinematic poles. Considering NAM/AF finite rotation poles, the EAFZ can be \n\napproached as the structural homologue of the Pico FZ this conclusion is not \n\ncorroborated by analougous EU/NAM rotations. Therefore if this structure acted as a \n\nsouthern plate boundary (South Azores Triple Junction - SATJ) for most of the \n\nevolution of the Azores plateau. The southern edge of stable Eurasia (here referred as \n\nthe North Azores Triple Junction - NATJ), could be defined along some structures \n\n 212 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n(ETVR, S. Miguel Island) as precursors of the current continuous Terceira axis as a \n\ndiscrete plate boundary. We are not able to provide an age estimate for the Terceira \n\nAxis nucleation. Given the amount of extension estimated for the time span using EU-\n\nAF stage poles, probably this structure did not act as a stable plate boundary for the time \n\nspan considered, and therefore it has been distributed across the Azores plateau.  \n\nStrong interaction of the SATJ with the AHS started probably at C6 times (20 Ma) \n\naccording to the models referred in this study. After a period of intense melt production \n\nand topography build-up which reached a maximum at C5, rifting of the Azores plateau \n\nand onset of normal seafloor spreading begun around 7 to 4 Ma as defined in those \n\nmodels.  BetweenC6 and C5 (ca. 15 Ma) the SATJ departed from the EAFZ (from an \n\nintra-transform context) northwestwards as suggested also by Vogt and Jung (2003).   \n\nThe Linear volcanic ridges that define the internal morpho-structure of the plateau are \n\nsub-parallel to the SATJ migration path and to the current Terceira axis segmentation \n\npattern. Three different mechanisms can be evoked to justify their growth: \n\n1) simultaneous growth by reactivation of fracture zones as leaky transforms. 2) \n\ndiachronical growth due to the AHS migration northward. 3) Diachronical growth due \n\nto SATJ migration from an intra-transform setting.  A schematic representation of these \n\nthree hypotheses is presented in Figure IX.1.  \n\nReactivation of MAR fracture zones in the Azores plateau, seems a plausible \n\nexplanation for the LVR in sector 1, given their orientations, but seems to be less \n\napplicable to the LVR from sector 2 as in this case, FZ traces, would correspond to a ca. \n\n20\u00ba clockwise rotation of sector 2 domain. Evidences of such a block rotation, like \n\ndevelopment of compressional ridges, are not clearly visible across the plateau, \n\n 213 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IX \u2013 Discussion and main conclusions \n \n \nfurthermore EU/NAM spreading directions have been fairly uniform since at least 10 \n\nMa to the present (Luis et al., 1994). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IX.9 - Three possible mechanism for the generation of the LVR. Top) LVR generate in a \ncontext of bi-axial stress field as leaky transforms. Center) LVR generate as response to Azores \nHot-spot north-westwards migration. Bottom) LVR generate in very recent times due to South \nAzores Triple Junction migration. Thick traces correspond to active LVR at a given moment. Gray \npolygon refers to expectable areas of distributed deformation. See text for details \n\n 214 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nThe second hypothesis implies a northeastern oriented age progression of the LVR as a \n\nresponse to the migration in the same direction of the AHS (Vogt and Jung, 2003). \n\nThese authors consider, by comparing the strikes of the LVR in both sectors that the \n\nLVR are traces of failed rifts either spreading obliquely (Sector 1) or normal (sector 2) \n\nto the main Nuvel1A conditions. Those authors propose a mechanism to justify both the \n\nmigration of the plate boundary and the arcuate shape of the LVR, where thickening of \n\nthe crust could have caused a zone weakening near the edge of the spreading boundary \n\nand its relocation northwards. This mechanism remains valid at a broader scale, to \n\nexplain northward migration of the Triple Junction, but the age progression it implies \n\nfor the LVR (progressively younger towards NE), does not fit our main observations \n\nthat geological and magnetic anomaly characteristics LVR sectors are coherent \n\ninternally but clearly distinct between sectors.   \n\nFinally, the third hypothesis, that we favour, links the LVR sector formation with the \n\nprogressive SATJ migration northwestwards.  As discussed in chapter II, considering \n\nthat the ridges in each sector run parallel to the proposed SATJ migration path, we \n\nenvisage that this progressive migration was underlined by areas of distributed \n\ndeformation on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate.  These tectonic features could \n\nbe either reactivated MAR fabrics or, as it was probably the case of sector 2, newly \n\nformed. These tectonic features would dominantly control magmatism and LVR \n\nformation at each ATJ progressive migration stage. This model implies that from the \n\nEAFZ towards the Mid-Atlantic Ridge there is an age progression which seems \n\nconsistent with the fact that the magnetic structure of LVR in sector 2 is more complex, \n\nand active volcanism less robust than their counterparts in sector 1. The main area of \n\nearthquake activity is currently located west of sector 1, where there are also evidences \n\n 215 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IX \u2013 Discussion and main conclusions \n \n \nfor westward progression of these ridges. Observed active volcanism in sector 2 could \n\nbe residual and feed either by Pico Central volcano and related fissural plumbing system \n\nin the case of EPVR or by analogue processes through the S. Jorge fissural system or \n\nthe Terceira axis itself in the case of STVR. \n\nAs triple junction migration proceeded, older sections of the LVR are progressively \n\nabandoned as failed rifts of the distributed plate boundary. Moreover, this becomes \n\nprogressively focalized along the Terceira axis and a new area of distributed \n\ndeformation is created further west.  This is, in our view the current status of LVR \n\nsector 1 comprising also the MAR off-axis domain between the Condor Ridge and the \n\nGraciosa parallels.  \n\nContrary to what is referred by Vogt and Jung, we consider that the morphological \n\ntransitions between LVR sectors have tectonic implications, as they correspond to \n\ndiscrete steps between bathymetric terraces and deepning of the Azores plateau. This \n\nsector limits as already observed, follow the strike of the expected NUVEL1A EU/AF \n\nspreading directions. Attesting to their probably recent age, they still have a reduced \n\nexpression in the Azores morphology.  \n\nIX.2 ATJ Present day Structure \n\nInter-Island GPS observations allowed the study of the kinematic behaviour of each \n\nIsland with respect to both stable Eurasia and African plates. We were able to constrain \n\nthat the bulk of inter-plate deformation is focused along the Terceira axis, with the \n\nexception of its northern sector corresponding to the Central Islands Group where \n\ndeformation is partitioned between Terceira-Graciosa southwards towards Condor ridge \n\nsouth of Faial Island. A broad segmentation pattern for the present day is proposed \n\n 216 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nbased on half space elastic dislocation modelling and geodetical observables. It defines \n\na plate boundary centered mainly on the Terceira axis up to the East Graciosa Basin \n\nlongitudes and then on a southern segment defined by the Pico-Faial alignment \n\nintersection with the MAR.  \n\nThis simple segmentation pattern does not fit all geological observations, and we \n\nconsider therefore that the plate boundary between the western sections of the Terceira \n\naxis and the Faial-Pico volcanic ridge constitutes and area of distributed deformation. \n\nThe GPS based solution, provided in Chapter IV does not accommodate fully the \n\nmechanics of the Triple Junction, the areal scatter of epicenter locations on the western \n\nLVR sector 1 nor the recent earthquake activity west of Graciosa Island documented in \n\nseismic catalogues. As the GPS solution suggests that present ongoing ATJ activity is \n\nlocated at the Faial Pico alignment, some tectonic transfer mechanism needs to be \n\nevoked to accommodate concomitance of this activity within this area, its concentration \n\neastwards along the Terceira Ridge and the constrasting lack of significant seismo-\n\ntectonic activity on the deeper sections of the plateau south of this region.   \n\nAnalysis of recent tectono-magmatic events and fault relations from sonar and \n\nbathymetric images, digital elevation models and ortophotomaps from Terceira Island, \n\nalong with magnetic data have allowed us definition of three fault families grouped \n\nmainly in NNW-SSE,  corresponding to the left lateral ruptures of 1980 in Angra do \n\nHeroismo and  1998 in Faial; WSW-ENE, also showned in recent studies based on the \n\nFaial 1998 earthquake (Dias, 2006; Fernandes, 2006) which seem conspicuous regional \n\nfeatures in LVR sector 1 and finnaly WNW-ESE corresponding to the strike of the LVR \n\nin this sector.   \n\n 217 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IX \u2013 Discussion and main conclusions \n \n \nThe azimuth for the relative motion between Eurasia and Africa is in sector 1, N66\u00ba for \n\nthe NUVEL 1A (De Mets et al, 1994) model. The azimuth for the relative motion \n\nbetween Eurasia to Nubia is N72\u00ba and N80\u00ba for the models DEOS2K (Fernandes et al., \n\n2003) and REVEL (Sella et al., 2002), respectively. These are based solely on GPS \n\nobservations and should be used as a reference for present-day motions.  \n\nThe displacement vectors obtained by the elastic modelling of a set of rectangular \n\nsources, performed in chapter VII, has shown a natural agreement with the expected \n\nopening normal to the Faial fissural system. However this opening direction is oblique \n\nwhen compared to Eu-Af(Nub) expectable direction (between ca. 35\u00ba and 50\u00ba) and, \n\nfurthermore the expectable right lateral component across this plate boundary is \n\nmissing. A similar result was obtained by (Louren\u00e7o et al., 1998) which showed that \n\ntraction vector averages calculated from focal mechanisms parallel to the Faial graben \n\ndirections, have an obliquity between ca 48 and 58\u00ba, when compared with kinematic \n\nmodels describing the behaviour of this plate boundary. Other LVR in this sector like S. \n\nJorge, or the Serreta ridge seem to present a similar discrepancy given their WNW-ESE \n\nstrikes. \n\nA possible interpretation for these apparently contradictory observations is to assume a \n\npartitioning in space and time of Nuvel 1A spreading vectors and in two main \n\ncomponents (see Figure XI.2): one of pure traction (rifting stage) and one dominated by \n\nshear (tectonic rotation stage).  \n\nRifting events are magmatic dominated and related with dyke emplacement along LVR \n\naxis and characterized, as constrained by the Capelinhos eruption model by extension \n\nnormal to the LVR axis.  These spreading events trigger nearly pure dip-slip faulting in \n\n 218 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \ncrustal sections along dyke strike, laterally adjacent and roofing the dyke emplacement \n\nand possible fissural type eruptions on the surface. Generalizing the Capelinhos eruption \n\ngeodetical observations, we can therefore consider the dyke emplacement process and \n\nthe corresponding growth of the LVR as a type I magma filled crack propagation. For \n\nexample, the graben in the western tip of S. Jorge Island can represent the crack tip \n\nprocess zone and tip depression, typical of this structures. In this regard, growth of the \n\nIslands would be intrinsically more dependent of internal magma pressure distributions \n\nand of magma migration paths across pre-existing zones of weakness during dyke \n\nemplacement process than of the external regional stress field.  \n\nShear stages would be characterized by left lateral strike slip faulting along N150\u00ba fault \n\nplanes like those which characterize the major Faial and Angra do Heroismo \n\nearthquakes, and also along the WSW-ENE faulting directions, in this case acting as  \n\nprobable relay zones with mixed right lateral strike slip and dip-slip displacements. \n\nFurthermore, if they are disrupted by slip along N150 faults, than opening as tension \n\ncracks or as normal faults is favoured. This might translate the mechanism and \n\ndistribution of the aftershocks of the Faial 1998 earthquake. \n\nThis two modes of tectono-magmatic strain accommodation would characterize the \n\ndistributed deformation nature of the interplate zone (roughly LVR sector 1) adjoining \n\nthe Terceira axis and Faial-Pico axis (Figure IX.3). The stress field prevailing in this \n\narea would than be right lateral transtensional, with maximum compressive stress \n\nhorizontal and sub-parallel to the LVR. This regime, and the non-coaxialiality of \n\ndeformation, can induce strain partitioning as observed at times in Terceira Island field \n\nstudies. \n\n 219 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IX \u2013 Discussion and main conclusions \n \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure IX.2 - Schematic Illustration representing the main tectono-magmatic orientations and its \nkinematic behavior across the studied sectors and as a function of dominant ruling processes \nMagmatic (left) or Tectonic (right).  Active structures are presented by continuous lines.  In sector \n1 the tectonic regime is transtensional, whereas in sector 2 is probably that of oblique spreading. \n\n \n\nIt is not clear if this tectonic spreading regime is active in the LVR sector 2. The fault \n\npattern configuration present in the EPVR southeastern tip, is conformal with the \n\nkinematic constraints provided by sector 1 focal mechanisms. However, lack of seismic \n\nactivity is this domain implies that either these faults are dominantly aseismic or they \n\n 220 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \nare becoming inactive and that LVR are being progressively abandoned as failed rifts. \n\nConsequently, in this sector, extension seems to be focalizing within the Terceira axis \n\nitself. The faulting pattern in the SETVR, despite having strike which is sub-parallel to \n\nleft lateral rupture of Angra do Heroismo earthquake, is more consistent with oblique \n\nright lateral extensional regime. This imposes that the stress regime changes accordingly \n\nand is characterized by a maximum compressive stress sub-vertical and minimum \n\ncompressive stress sub-horizontal and sub-parallel to the spreading directions predicted \n\nby Nuvel-1A or GPS based kinematic models (e.g. Revel and Deos2k), therefore \n\ncharacterized by coaxial deformation.  \n\nThis focalized plate boundary domain fits between two other faulting domains defined \n\nby Ribeiro (2002) along the Terceira axis. This author suggests a relation exists between \n\nthe lithosphere state of stress off axis with the response of faulting in each domain on \n\naxis (cf. Figure 4.9, pg 193 from Ribeiro et al., 2002). East of the area here studied in \n\nmore detail, in S. Miguel Island and its vicinities, right lateral strike slip faults are \n\nreported by this author, striking N150\u00ba, probably related with the intersection of this \n\nsegment with the Gloria Fault. \n\n The transition from distributed transtension to focalized oblique extension is defined by \n\na set of morphological setps between LVR 1 and LVR2 sectors here interpreted as \n\ntectonic faults which are acting as tranfer zones between both domains and which \n\nstrikes are parallel to Nuvel1A spreading directions (i.e WSW-ENE). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 221 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IX \u2013 Discussion and main conclusions \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IX.3 \u2013 Cartoon depicting a tectono-magmatic model for the present day in the Azores Triple \nJunction area a summary of all observations.

The main problem in \n\nAzores interpretations is the almost absolute lack of knowledge on boundary conditions, \n\nnotably, its thermal structure in depth, and the still limited data we have on the Azores \n\nplateau bathymetry itself. In my point of view future efforts in Azores research, \n\nconsidering each scientific domain should be : \n\nGeodesy: \n\nContinuing the inter-Island and intra-Island GPS observation efforts, which have been \n\nperformed in the framework of TANGO and STAMINA projects, and increment intra-\n\nIsland networks, would consolidate GPS interpretation by lengthening the time series in \n\nthis geodynamic context and provide an additional tool to constrain how the far-field \n\ndisplacement vectors are partitioning within each Island complex volcano-tectonic \n\narchitecture therefore constraining its crustal deformation. \n\nGeophysics: \n\nOur ability to perform a detailed analysis of the processes which act and shape the \n\nAzores is undermined by inexistence of a proper bathymetric basemap.  A continued \n\neffort to collect swath bathymetry in this domain is crucial to allow clearer answers and \n\nas a ground to evaluate the third and fourth dimensions (i.e. depth and time).  \n\nHeat flow measurements within some of the Terceira axis basins would help clarify in \n\nwhat extent is the Azores truly a rift system or otherwise a fully developed spreading \n\ncenter. Determining the structure of the basins with reflection/refraction studies would \n\n 223 \n\n\n\n \nChapter IX \u2013 Discussion and main conclusions \n \n \nalso provide more constraints for the gravimetric modelling as well as provide tectonic \n\nconstraints on its role in Terceira axis dynamics. Refinement of the seismic catalogue, \n\nnamely in what deals with azimuthal coverage, and better definition of hypocentral \n\ndistribution would also favour analysis and tectonic interpretations. \n\nGeology: \n\nDirect seafloor observations by submersible or ROV as well as sampling of the basins \n\nwalls would help define a clear crustal structure for this particular case of hyper-slow \n\nplate boundary.  \n\nFollowing Vogt and Jung, 2003, one of the basins within the Terceira axis, should be a \n\ntarget for an ODP drilling site, as an enormous amount of information could be \n\nretrieved from such an initiative. It would allow determination of the age of the basins \n\nand hence of the Terceira axis, their detailed structure, and the way hyper-slow crustal \n\nconstruction is achieved. \n\nIsotopic Dating of seafloor monogenic volcanism and samples of the base of the LVR \n\nwould help to constrain the Azores temporal evolution.  \n\nAnalogue and Numerical Modelling: \n\nSome insights on LVR development and the physical properties of Azores lithosphere \n\nand thermal structure could be gained by numerical modelling of the LVR growth, \n\nnamely the suggestion that these structures are propagating westwards either as newly \n\nformed cracks or by reactivation of pre-existing fracture zones.  \n\n 224 \n\n\n\n \nTectono-Magmatic Processes in the Azores Triple Junction \n\n \n \n\nX - Cited References \n\nAltamimi, Z., Sillard, P., Boucher, C., (2002).
