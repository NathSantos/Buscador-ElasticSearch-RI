O conhecimento em tempo real das \npropriedades f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas dos derivados de petr\u00f3leo \u00e9 essencial para \notimizar as opera\u00e7\u00f5es de refina\u00e7\u00e3o, garantindo assim opera\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9cnica, \necon\u00f3mica e ambientalmente adequadas. \n\nA primeira parte deste trabalho envolveu a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de um elevado n\u00famero \nde experi\u00eancias, efetuadas na refinaria de Matosinhos, seguindo m\u00e9todos \nconvencionais normalizados, importantes para avaliar e caracterizar as \ncorrentes de gas\u00f3leo de v\u00e1cuo leve, gas\u00f3leo de v\u00e1cuo pesado e fuel \u00f3leo. As \npropriedades analisadas foram a massa vol\u00famica, viscosidade cinem\u00e1tica, teor \nem enxofre, ponto de inflama\u00e7\u00e3o, res\u00edduo carbonoso, valor P e a destila\u00e7\u00e3o \natmosf\u00e9rica e de v\u00e1cuo. Para al\u00e9m da determina\u00e7\u00e3o de todas estas \npropriedades f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas, usando os m\u00e9todos convencionais, as mesmas \namostras foram analisadas por espectroscopia de resson\u00e2ncia magn\u00e9tica \nnuclear. \n\nA segunda parte deste trabalho esteve relacionada com a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de \nm\u00e9todos estat\u00edsticos multivari\u00e1veis que relacionam as propriedades f\u00edsico-\nqu\u00edmicas com a informa\u00e7\u00e3o quantitativa adquirida por espectroscopia de \nresson\u00e2ncia magn\u00e9tica nuclear. V\u00e1rios m\u00e9todos foram aplicados, incluindo a \nan\u00e1lise por componentes principais, a regress\u00e3o m\u00faltipla por componentes \nprincipais, as regress\u00f5es m\u00faltiplas parciais e as redes neuronais artificiais. A \nan\u00e1lise de componentes principais foi utilizada para reduzir o n\u00famero de \nvari\u00e1veis preditivas e transform\u00e1-las em novas vari\u00e1veis, os componentes \nprincipais. Estes componentes principais foram utilizados como vari\u00e1veis de \nentrada da regress\u00e3o m\u00faltipla por componentes principais e das redes \nneuronais artificiais. Na regress\u00e3o por m\u00ednimos quadrados parciais os dados \noriginais foram usados como vari\u00e1veis de entrada. Tomando em considera\u00e7\u00e3o \no desempenho dos modelos desenvolvidos, com recurso a par\u00e2metros \nestat\u00edsticos, foi poss\u00edvel concluir que a regress\u00e3o m\u00faltipla por componentes \nprincipais contribuiu para piores desempenhos. Melhores desempenhos foram \nobtidos com a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da regress\u00e3o por m\u00ednimos quadrados parciais e das \nredes neuronais artificiais. No entanto, foi com os modelos de redes neuronais \nartificiais que melhores desempenhos foram obtidos em quase todas as \npropriedades analisadas. \n\nTendo em conta os resultados obtidos, foi poss\u00edvel concluir que a \nespectroscopia de resson\u00e2ncia magn\u00e9tica nuclear combinada com m\u00e9todos  \nestat\u00edsticos multivari\u00e1veis pode ser usada para prever as propriedades f\u00edsico-\nqu\u00edmicas de derivados de petr\u00f3leo. Demonstrou-se que esta t\u00e9cnica pode ser \nconsiderada como uma potencial alternativa aos m\u00e9todos convencionais \ntendo-se obtido resultados bastantes promissores. \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords \n \n\nCrude oil fractions, physical-chemical properties, nuclear magnetic resonance \nspectroscopy, multivariate statistical methods, principal component analysis, \nprincipal component regression, partial least squares, artificial neural networks, \nstatistical performance indexes. \n \n\nAbstract \n \n\nThe main objective of this work was to monitor a set of physical-chemical \nproperties of heavy oil procedural streams through nuclear magnetic resonance \nspectroscopy, in order to propose an analysis procedure and online data \nprocessing for process control. Different statistical methods which allow to \nrelate the results obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with \nthe results obtained by the conventional standard methods during the \ncharacterization of the different streams, have been implemented in order to \ndevelop models for predicting these same properties. The real-time knowledge \nof these physical-chemical properties of petroleum fractions is very important \nfor enhancing refinery operations, ensuring technically, economically and \nenvironmentally proper refinery operations. \n\nThe first part of this work involved the determination of many physical-chemical \nproperties, at Matosinhos refinery, by following some standard methods \nimportant to evaluate and characterize light vacuum gas oil, heavy vacuum gas \noil and fuel oil fractions. Kinematic viscosity, density, sulfur content, flash point, \ncarbon residue, P-value and atmospheric and vacuum distillations were the \nproperties analysed. Besides the analysis by using the standard methods, the \nsame samples were analysed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. \n\nThe second part of this work was related to the application of multivariate \nstatistical methods, which correlate the physical-chemical properties with the \nquantitative information acquired by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. \nSeveral methods were applied, including principal component analysis, \nprincipal component regression, partial least squares and artificial neural \nnetworks. Principal component analysis was used to reduce the number of \npredictive variables and to transform them into new variables, the principal \ncomponents. These principal components were used as inputs of the principal \ncomponent regression and artificial neural networks models. For the partial \nleast squares model, the original data was used as input. Taking into account \nthe performance of the develop models, by analysing selected statistical \nperformance indexes, it was possible to conclude that principal component \nregression lead to worse performances. When applying the partial least \nsquares and artificial neural networks models better results were achieved. \nHowever, it was with the artificial neural networks model that better predictions \nwere obtained for almost of the properties analysed. \n\nWith reference to the results obtained, it was possible to conclude that nuclear \nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with multivariate statistical \nmethods can be used to predict physical-chemical properties of petroleum \nfractions. It has been shown that this technique can be considered a potential \nalternative to the conventional standard methods having obtained very \npromising results. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\n \n\nTable of Contents .................................................................................................................. i \n\nFigure Index ......................................................................................................................... v \n\nTable Index .......................................................................................................................... xi \n\nList of Abbreviations ......................................................................................................... xv \n\nNotation ............................................................................................................................. xxi \n\n1.

Scientific Relevance \n\nIn the last decades, the petroleum industry had a great interest in refining light crude oils as \n\nthey were easier to process and had lower operational costs. However, the quantities of \n\nlight crude oil world reserves are decreasing and thus to acquire this type of crude oil \n\nbecomes more expensive when compared to the purchase costs of heavier crude oils. With \n\nthis and due to the growing worldwide energy demands and the increase demands of high \n\nquality distillates with tighter specifications, petroleum industries need to process \n\nincreasingly heavier crudes and converted them from low value heavier petroleum \n\nfractions into lighter high value products. In the conversion of these heavier fractions, \n\nfrequent innovations and new processes are implemented at petroleum industry to convert \n\nthe heavier petroleum fractions and petroleum residues into products with more high \n\ncommercial values. The problem associated with the refining of heavier petroleum \n\nfractions is the higher quantities of heavy residues that are obtained. The heavy residues \n\nare characterized for their complex composition rich in asphaltenes, sulfur, nitrogen and \n\nmetal ions. The characterization of these fractions to obtain the products with desirable \n\ncharacteristics and defined specifications and to optimize the process conditions is a very \n\nimportant challenge in the refineries. \n\nIn the refining industry there are some appropriate methods, including the ASTM, which \n\ncan be applied in the characterization of the physical-chemical properties of such products. \n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks associated with these laboratory analyses as time \n\nconsuming, the cost of each analysis and the many involving steps such as sampling, \n\nsample handling, sample preparation, measurements, data handling and reporting. The \n\nproblem associated with these laboratory analyses are related to the delay between \n\nsampling and validation of the analytical results. This delay prevents process conditions \n\nbeing corrected and adjusted at the right time by applying a corrective response, \n\ncontributing to obtain products out of specifications and units working at wrong \n\nconditions. An alternative would be to implement online quantitative technologies that \n\nallow full and real time characterization of the control process conditions and the final \n\nproducts. The production of the required range of fractions at maximum yield and at a \n\nminimum cost is one of the refineries goals.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n \n\n4 \n \n\nThe physical-chemical properties of petroleum fractions are the result of the influence of \n\nthe physical-chemical properties of each individual substance which is part of the sample \n\nand of the iterations that each individual substance experiences with the surroundings. The \n\nidentification of these compounds contributes to the identification of the physical-chemical \n\nproperties of the product analysed. Once the physical properties are correlated with the \n\nchemical compositions it is possible to apply spectrometric methods to quantitatively \n\ndetermine the physical properties of a composition of chemical substances, such as a \n\npetroleum product. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the chosen technique, due to its \n\ncapability to provide great information on the chemical nature of individual types of proton \n\nand carbon atoms in different and complex mixtures of petroleum fractions. The great \n\nadvantage of this technique is that it measures the physical properties of transparent, \n\nopaque and dense solutions by only one measurement and it can be applied to many \n\nstreams of an industrial refining complex (The Qualion Company, 2006).  \n\nThe progress made in the interpretation of the NMR spectra with the development of \n\ndifferent multivariate statistical methods can give relevant information about the \n\nidentification and structural characterization of hydrocarbons and their physical-chemical \n\nproperties. Principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS) and artificial \n\nneural networks (ANN) are examples of multivariate statistical methods used in this work \n\nto highlight the correlations among the NMR spectra and the target properties. Kinematic \n\nviscosity, density, carbon residue, P-value, sulfur content, flash point, vacuum and \n\natmospheric distillation are examples of some of the properties analysed in this work.  \n\nThe use of industrial applications of NMR spectroscopy and multivariate models can \n\nenhance the refining industries operation as a result of a better knowledge of the streams \n\ncomposition in the refining process, as well as in the prediction of the better operating \n\nconditions for obtaining refined products with desired specifications and in adequate \n\nquantities to achieve the market demands.  \n\nWith this work it is expected to demonstrate that the combination of \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy \n\nwith multivariate statistical methods can be used to correlate the chemical composition of \n\neach stream with their physical-chemical properties. The real time knowledge of the \n\nphysical-chemical properties of each stream is very important for process control \n\ncontributing to obtain best performances in the operation of the units. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n1.2. Thesis Structure \n\nThe structure of this thesis is summarily described in this section. This document is divided \n\ninto seven chapters, with Chapter 1 as the introduction.  \n\nIn Chapter 2, the characterization and classification of petroleum is briefly referred. An \n\noverview of petroleum processing history until the development of the modern petroleum \n\nindustry is described. Afterward, the characterization of the petroleum industry, where this \n\nstudy was developed, and a more detailed discussion around the products and their \n\nphysical-chemical properties which are object of study is presented. The aim of this \n\nchapter is to give a brief presentation about the main topics covered throughout the current \n\nwork.  \n\nIn Chapter 3, a comparison between some chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques \n\ncapable to characterize petroleum fractions is made. This chapter is important to \n\nunderstand why NMR is the chosen technique for the determination of the physical-\n\nchemical properties of petroleum fractions. Subsequently, the NMR spectroscopy \n\ntechnique is described. Additionally, in this chapter a review about the applications of \n\nNMR in the analysis of petroleum and heavy petroleum fractions is presented.  \n\nIn Chapter 4, the experimental section is presented. The description of the ASTM and IP \n\nstandard methods used to determine the physical-chemical properties of the different \n\nanalysed samples are described in detail. The set-up of the procedures adopted for the \n\nmanipulation of the NMR spectra data is explained.  \n\nChapter 5 presents a detailed description of the multivariate statistical methods used to \n\nexploit the information content of the NMR data. Principal component analysis is used to \n\nselect the number of principal components that are needed as inputs for principal \n\ncomponent regression and artificial neural networks. Principal component regression, \n\nartificial neural networks and partial least squares are used to highlight the correlations \n\namong the NMR spectra and the properties proposed in Chapter 4.  \n\nIn Chapter 6, the results of this work are presented and discussed for the different samples \n\nand using different multivariate models. The performance of the models for predicting the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n \n\n6 \n \n\nphysical-chemical properties of the different samples with NMR are evaluated by using \n\nstatistical models.  \n\nIn Chapter 7, the main conclusions of this thesis are pointed out as well as some \n\nsuggestions for future work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nPPEETTRROOLLEEUUMM  IINNDDUUSSTTRRYY  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPetroleum refining industry uses crude oil as raw material in the production of a \n\nlarge assortment of commodities and products important to human life and in \n\nmany other processes.

Crude Oil \n\nCrude oil, also called petroleum, continues to be a very important power source for our \n\ncivilization. It is flammable at a room temperature and can be very fluid and clear or very \n\ndark and viscous, depending on the quantity of light or heavy distillates, respectively. \n\nCrude oil is generally lighter than water and it presents a characteristic and strong odour. It \n\nis known that crude oil doesn\u2019t have a simple chemical formula, but it has a very complex \n\nchemical composition that allows wider variety of uses. It is possible to say that crude oil \n\nis a mixture of many different hydrocarbons and small amounts of impurities (Table 2.1). \n\nThese compounds as well as their proportions vary significantly with crude oils. Even \n\ncrude oils from the same geographical area can be very different depending on its source, \n\nalthough, at elemental level, the typical composition of these compounds are carbon (83-\n\n87%), hydrogen (11.5-14%) and heteroatoms (1-5.5%) (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). \n\nCrude oil can be classified in different ways depending on: i) the type of hydrocarbons; ii) \n\nthe American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity; iii) the sulfur content; and iv) the acid \n\ncontent. Taking into account the different hydrocarbons, paraffinic, naphthenic and \n\naromatic hydrocarbons, crude oil can be classified as paraffinic, paraffinic-naphthenic, \n\nnaphthenic, aromatic and aromatic-naphthenic crude. With these designations an idea is \n\ngiven on which type of hydrocarbons exist in higher quantities, since each crude oil \n\ncontains all different types of these hydrocarbons in different percentages. \n\n \n\nParaffinic crude \u2013 Crude with higher quantity of paraffinic hydrocarbons, normally more \n\nthan 75% of paraffinic compounds. This type of crude is characterized as a light and fluid \n\ncrude, for having a smaller density (smaller than 0.85 g/mL), a smaller viscosity, a smaller \n\nquantity of sulfur and a smaller quantity, smaller than 10%, of resins and asphaltenes. \n\nNormally a paraffinic crude is responsible for the production of: i) gasoline with lower \n\noctane index; ii) kerosene with high quality; iii) gas oil with good combustion conditions; \n\niv) lube oils with high viscosity index and chemical stability; and v) residuum rich in \n\nparaffins. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n10 \n \n\nParaffinic-naphthenic crude \u2013 This type of crude is characterized for having a rich \n\ncomposition in paraffinic compounds (50 to 75%) and a smaller amount of naphthenic \n\ncompounds (less than 20%). The quantity of resins and asphaltenes is small as well as the \n\nsulfur content. This crude has higher viscosity and density compared with a paraffinic \n\ncrude.  \n\n \n\nNaphthenic crude \u2013 A naphthenic crude is characterized for having a high quantity of \n\nnaphthenic compounds and a small percentage of sulfur. Normally the use of naphthenic \n\ncrude contributes to the production of gasoline with higher octane index.  \n\n \n\nAromatic crude \u2013 This crude normally contains about 50% of aromatic compounds. It is \n\ncharacterized for having more asphaltenes and resins than the other crudes (normally 10 to \n\n30%) and higher quantity of impurities such as sulfur (more than 1%).  \n\n \n\nAromatic-naphthenic crude \u2013 An aromatic-naphthenic crude is characterized for having \n\non its composition less than 35% of naphthenic compounds. The quantity of resins and \n\nasphaltenes is higher when compared with an aromatic crude and it can be higher than \n\n25%. When compared with an aromatic crude the quantity of sulfur can be lower, normally \n\nhaving values between 0.4 to 1%. \n\n \n\nRelatively to the API gravity scale, a higher API values means a lower density and, \n\nconsequently, means that crude oil has a higher quantity of valuable low boiling point \n\nfractions. Taking into account the API gravity scale, crude oil can be classified as heavy or \n\nlight crude. Heavy crude oil is richer in higher boiling fractions, contains greater amounts \n\nof aromatic and naphthenic structures and higher quantity of heteroatoms. Light crude oil \n\ncontains lower boiling constituents and waxy molecules and smaller amounts of \n\nheteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and metals (Altgelt et al., 1994). This light \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\ncrude oil is the easiest and cheapest to produce and refine but the main problem is that the \n\nworld\u2019s oil resources available are from heavy and viscous crude oils.  \n\nDue to the sulfur content, crude oil can be classified as sour (high amount of sulfur) or \n\nsweet (low amount of sulfur). The presence of higher quantities of sulfur may have \n\nenvironment impact and effects on refining operations (Speight, 2002).  \n\nRelatively to the acid content, an acid crude oil is classified for having the total acid \n\nnumber (TAN) higher than 1.0 mg KOH/g. The use of crude oils with a high TAN can give \n\nrise to corrosion problems in the refineries and several problems with product quality and \n\nenvironmental protection (Hsu et al., 2006). \n\nNormally the heavier and denser crude oil has a minimal value but it can be used in the \n\nproduction of many fuels, like gasoline, gas oil, naphtha, kerosene and fuel oil, and it can \n\nprovide raw materials that are used in different industries to make plastics, paints and \n\nfibers. When crude oil is refined it gives high valued products although further investments \n\nand efforts are needed to take advance of the \u201cbottom of barrel\u201d and with that increase the \n\nproduction of these products with high commercial interest. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.1: Composition of crude oil. \n\nH\ny\nd\n\nr\no\nc\na\nr\nb\n\no\nn\n\ns \n\nParaffins \n\n(e.g. isooctane) \n \n\nCan present different structures, straight chain (normal paraffins) and branched chains (isoparaffins). Of \n\nthese two different structures (straight and branched chains), the most frequent in the heavier fractions of \n\ncrude oil are the branched chains (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). The branched chains have a high octane \n\nindex leading to a high quality of gasoline. \n\nAromatics \n\n(e.g. pyrene) \n \n\nThe presence of aromatic compounds in heavy crude oils play an important role in the production of \n\ngasoline and in the production of aromatic compounds (ex.: toluene and benzene). It is possible to find \n\nheavy aromatic or light aromatic compounds depending on the petroleum fraction in analysis. The light \n\nones have huge benefits for some units, as the platforming, as these compounds provide good octane \n\nindexes. The heaviest ones are responsible for some problems that may occur in some petroleum products, \n\nsuch as jet and diesel. \n\nNaphthenes \n\n(e.g. cyclohexane)  \n\nCycloalkanes, known as naphthenes in the petroleum chemistry, are cyclic saturated hydrocarbons defined \n\nby the number of rings as mononaphthenes (monocyclic alkanes, CnH2n), dinaphthenes (dicyclic alkanes, \n\nCnH2n-2) and trinaphthenes (tricyclic alkanes, CnH2n-4). They are found in high quantities in most crude oils \n\nand are relatively stable. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.1: Composition of crude oil (continuation). \n\n \n\n       Drawbacks \n\nAsphaltenes \n\n \n\n \n\n(*) \n\nConstitute the heaviest fraction of crude oil and are a \n\ncomplex mixture of molecules that contains \n\nsignificant quantities of heteroatoms (S, N, V, Ni, \n\n....), condensed aromatic rings, aliphatic chains and \n\nnaphthenic rings. \n\nThey are responsible for the obstruction in flow \n\nlines, pipelines and petroleum wells and to the \n\npoisoning of the catalyst used in the cracking and \n\nhydrocracking process (Wauquier, 1995). \n\nH\ne\nte\n\nr\no\n\nc\no\nm\n\np\no\nu\n\nn\nd\n\ns \n\nSulfur \n\n(e.g. thiophenol) \n \n\nSulfur may be present in the form of sulfites, \n\nthiophenols, cycloalkanethiols, thiophenes, \n\nbenzothiophenes and alkylbenzothiophenes. Crude \n\ncan be classified as sour or sweet crude depending on \n\nthe quantity of sulfur (values higher than 0.5% \n\nmeans sour crude and less than 0.5% means sweet \n\ncrude).  \n\nThey contribute to the development of corrosion,  \n\nwhich damages the equipment, contributes to the \n\nair pollution due to the emission of SOx in the \n\natmosphere, to the catalyst contamination and are \n\ntoxic. Sour crude cause many problems during the \n\nrefining and its treatment is expensive and difficult \n\nbecause it needs specific equipments. \n\nOxygen \n\n(e.g. methyl vinyl \n\nketone)  \n\nThese compounds may be present, for example, as \n\ncarboxylic acids (ex: naphthenic acids), phenols, \n\nesters, amides and ketones. \n\nThey are responsible for the crude acidity. A high \n\nacidity means problems in the refineries as it \n\naggravates the effect of corrosion in equipments \n\nand pipelines, makes changes in the colour and \n\nodour and also in the costs associated with the \n\nequipments protection. \n\nNitrogen \n\n(e.g. pyridine)  \n\nThese compounds may be present in the organic \n\nform, for example, in the form of pyridines, \n\nquinolines, pyrroles, polycyclic compounds with \n\noxygen and sulfur. \n\nThey contribute to the catalyst poisoning and are \n\nresponsible for the change in the quality of the final \n\nproducts. \n\nMetal ions  \n\nIt is possible to distinguish nickel, vanadium, iron, \n\nzinc, mercury, boron, sodium, potassium, calcium \n\nand magnesium. \n\nThey are responsible for the catalyst poisoning. \n\n(*) Asphaltenes do not have a chemical molecular structure. This will be discussed in the Chapter 3. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n14 \n \n\n2.2. Crude Oil Refining \n\nSince the discovery of petroleum, many refinery industries have been developed all over \n\nthe world being the first refinery opened in 1861 (Hsu et al., 2006). Initially, the most \n\nvaluable petroleum fraction was kerosene, produced by simple atmospheric distillation \n\n(Hsu et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2006), while the distillates heavier than kerosene were \n\nnormally used as fuel oils and for making paving and roofing asphalts and the undistilled \n\nresidues were discarded (Altgelt et al., 1994; Hsu et al., 2006). Nowadays the need in the \n\nvariation of products as gasoline, gas oil, jet fuel and petrochemicals, contributed to the use \n\nof petroleum and its heavy ends. The growing of the automobile industry in the beginning \n\nof the twentieth century was one of the main factors that contribute to the development of \n\nthe petroleum refining. Imagining the markets needs, in the near future, and with the object \n\nto increase the efficiency and the quality in the production of crude oil derivatives \n\nsignificant investments were made in the refining processes. With that, the refineries that \n\nprocess light and medium crude oils suffer significant changes to refine heavy crude oil. \n\nThis heavy crude oil contains higher quantities of heavy fractions that, due to its molecular \n\nstructure (long molecular chains) and its higher boiling point, requires the use of more \n\nenergy in the refining processes. This explains the necessity to improve the refinery \n\nindustry with the aim in improving the quality of petroleum fractions and the efficiency in \n\nthe conversion of the heavy fractions. It is possible to say that the evolution of the refinery \n\nindustry was notorious over the last years and it occurred due to the worldwide demand for \n\nrefined products and environmental laws that become increasingly stringent contributing to \n\nthe development of new processes (Wauquier, 1995). The most important refining steps \n\ncan be included in different processes as the separation, conversion, finishing and the \n\nenvironmental protection processes (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003; Speight, 2006). These \n\nprocesses, shown in Table 2.2, have emerged and improved over the years. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nTable 2.2: Basic operations in petroleum processing. \n\nProcess Definition Examples \n\nSeparation \n\nSeparation of the constituents of crude oils \n\ninto fractions having similar properties \n\ntaking into account differences of boiling \n\npoint, melting point, density or solubility.  \n\nDistillation \n\nAbsorption \n\nExtraction \n\nCrystallization \n\nAdsorption \n\nConversion \n\nConversion of the separated hydrocarbons \n\ninto new molecules that contributed to \n\nobtain the desirable products with \n\ndesirable properties. \n\nCatalytic reforming \n\nIsomerization \n\nAlkylation \n\nEther synthesis \n\nOligomerization \n\nVisbreaking \n\nCoking \n\nCatalytic cracking \n\nSteam reforming \n\nHydroconversion \n\nFinishing \n\nExclusion of elements and compounds that \n\nare not desirable to improve the quality of \n\nthe desirable products \n\nHydrotreatment / Hydrogenation \n\nSweetening \n\nEnvironmental \n\nProtection \n\nResponsible for the processing of effluents \n\nand gases. \n\nAcid gas processing  \n\nStack gas processing \n\nWaste water treatment  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe first petroleum industries, denominated as simple refinery, were characterized for the \n\nproduction of gasoline, gas oil, domestic heating oil and industrial fuel oil. The refining \n\nsteps included a primary distillation, a catalytic reforming along with a pretreatment step \n\nfor improving the gasoline pool octane number, a partial hydrodesulfurization of the gas oil \n\nfraction and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene sweetening. These refineries \n\nwere characterized for the absence of conversion process in product streams (excluding \n\nheavy naphtha stream) and for producing 40 to 50% of residual fuel oil. Figure 2.1 \n\nrepresents a typical refining flowsheet of a simple refinery, where it is possible to see a \n\ncatalytic reforming, very important to upgrade the gasoline octane number and to the \n\nproduction of hydrogen. Hydrogen was then used in other processes to enrich other \n\nfractions. In the same figure it is also possible to see a visbreaker unit although it was not \n\nwidely used in that period and so considered as an alternative unit to the production of fuel \n\noil (Wauquier, 1995; Decroocq, 1997). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1: Example of a refining flowsheet of a simple refinery. Adapted from Wauquier (1995). \n\n \n\nSince the simple refinery was no longer suitable to the market, a rapid growing of \n\npetroleum industries was visualized. The implementation of new units as the vacuum \n\ndistillation, the catalytic cracking and/or hydrocracking of the vacuum distillate and the \n\nvisbreaking were one of the main factors that helped refineries in the production of more \n\ngasoline and distillates. With this, refineries could answer the markets demands for other \n\npetroleum fractions. Consequently, there was a decrease in the demand of residual fuel oils \n\nwhich production passed from 40-50% to 20-25% of crude. Although, with this type of \n\nconventional refineries it was notorious an increase in the content of pollutants like sulfur, \n\nnitrogen and metals (Wauquier, 1995; Decroocq, 1997; Hsu et al., 2006). This increase of \n\npollutants, which did not respect the environmental regulations, could be related to the \n\nabsence of process responsible for: i) lowering the sulfur content in gas oil and domestic \n\nheating oil; ii) the reduction of SOx emissions; and iii) the elimination of lead in gasoline. \n\nThe presence of lead in gasoline was related to the poisons that contaminated the active \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nmetal of the catalytic converters used to remove carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from \n\nautomobile exhaust (Wauquier, 1995; Hsu et al., 2006). In Figure 2.2 it is possible to see \n\nan example of this conventional refinery. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2: Example of a refining flowsheet of a conventional refinery. Adapted from Wauquier (1995). \n\n \n\nTo achieve a solution to respect the environmental regulations and to respect the \n\nrequirements for reformulated gasoline and low sulfur content, the refineries started to \n\ndevelop and implement new processes and units, as shown in Figure 2.3. Isomerization, \n\netherification (MTBE \u2013 methyl-t-butyl ether, ETBE \u2013 ethyl-t-butyl ether, TAME \u2013 methyl-\n\nt-amyl ether) and alkylation are examples of three units that helped in the reduction and \n\nelimination of lead in the gasoline. The hydrodesulfurization of the fluid catalytic cracking \n\n(FCC) feedstock and the hydrodesulfurization of gas oils and domestic heating oils are \n\nexamples of hydrotreating that contributed to the reduction of SOx emissions and to obtain \n\nproducts with high quality. In these refineries it become regular to use low sulfur light \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n18 \n \n\ncrude since the conversion of heavy residues was not always made (Wauquier, 1995; Hsu \n\net al., 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3: Example of a refining flowsheet of petroleum industries. Adapted from Wauquier (1995). \n\n \n\nIn today\u2019s refineries the great challenge is to convert large quantities of heavy crude oils \n\nand to reduce the aromatics content. Since the quantities of the light crude oils became less \n\navailable and more expensive, the refineries had to introduce complementary conversion \n\nprocesses to transform the heavy crude oils into specific sets of refined products to meet \n\nthe market demands. These heavy crude oils are generally less expensive and give greater \n\nyields of lower value higher boiling products, therefore, complex and expensive processes \n\nhave been introduced to convert them into lower boiling products. Units as hydrocracking \n\nand catalytic cracking have their high importance in the production of diesel motor fuel \n\nand gasoline, respectively. Other new processes as the alkylation, polymerization, \n\nisomerization and the dehydrogenation of n-butane may have greater importance. The \n\ngrowing of the refineries depends on the type of the used crude oils, light crude oil or \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nheavy crude oil, on its costs, the market demands and on the final product specifications. \n\nTo remain viable, to meet the markets demands and every crude supplies, the refineries \n\nneed to be constantly adapt and upgrade. As a result, the simple refinery, highly dependent \n\non local markets, responsible to prepare feedstocks for petrochemical manufacture, for the \n\nproduction of industrial fuels, large quantities of unfinished oil, desulfurized distillated \n\nfuels and high octane gasoline, upgrade to the most versatile conversion refinery. This \n\nconversion refinery besides all the bases units that already exist also incorporates new \n\nconversion processes, new solvent extraction processes for manufacturing lubricants and \n\npetrochemical units to recover propylene, benzene, toluene, and xylenes. Consequently, an \n\nincreased in the yields and quality of the refined petroleum products is notorious \n\n(Wauquier, 1995; Decroocq, 1997; Hsu et al., 2006; Speight, 2006). Figure 2.4 represents a \n\npossible flowsheet of a today\u2019s refinery. \n\n \n\nThe intention of the flowsheets presented is to give an idea about the growth and \n\ndevelopment of new processes in refineries. However the refineries are not all the same, \n\nthere are many different things that differentiate them, as the location, history and markets \n\ndrivers. Each refinery has its own flowsheet that depends on the refinery goals. There are \n\nsome refineries more interested in the production of gasoline whereas other refineries are \n\nmore oriented toward the production of middle distillates such as jet fuel and gas oil. \n\nBesides all the differences, most refineries perform the same basic operations presented in \n\nTable 2.2. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4: Example of a possible today\u2019s refining flowsheet (Speight, 2006). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n21 \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Crude Oil Refining in Portugal  \n\nGalp Energia S.A. is an example of a company operating with a modern petroleum \n\nrefining. Galp Energia S.A. is responsible for the exploitation and production of crude oil \n\nand natural gas, for the refining and distribution of petroleum products, for the distribution \n\nand sale of natural gas and generation and commercialization of electricity (Galp Energia, \n\n2010a). It has a capacity of refining 330 thousand barrels per day of crude oil. Galp \n\nEnergia is divided into two refineries, Matosinhos refinery (Figure 2.5) which has a \n\n110000 bbl/day (barrel per day) distillation capacity and Sines refinery which has a \n\ndistillation capacity of 220000 bbl/day. These two refineries working together in a \n\ncoordinate and integrate way are responsible for the normal supply of fuels, base oils, \n\naromatics, asphalt and other products needed in different sectors of activity including \n\naviation, marine transportation and lubricants industry (Galp Energia, 2010a; Galp \n\nEnergia, 2010b; Galp Energia, 2011b). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5: Matosinhos refinery - Galp Energia S.A. (Galp Energia, 2010b). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n22 \n \n\n2.2.2. Matosinhos Refinery \n\nMatosinhos refinery, located in the north of Portugal, started operating in 1969. It is an \n\nexample of a modern refinery presenting different units and processes, incorporating most \n\nof the processes presented in Figure 2.4. Matosinhos refinery doesn\u2019t have a hydrocracking \n\nand catalytic cracking but produces and sends the feedstocks for these units located at \n\nSines refinery. One of the goals of Matosinhos refinery is to increase the production of gas \n\noil due to the implementation of two new units as the vacuum distillation and the \n\nvisbreaker unit. With these units the refinery has now the ability of processing different \n\nheavy and light crude oils and is prepared to receive acid crude oils. In addition, to \n\nimprove the environmental performance other units responsible for the treatment of acid \n\nwater and for sulfur recovery were implemented (Figure 2.6). Moreover, to reduce the \n\nenvironmental impact and to obtain a more energetically efficient refinery a new \n\ncogeneration unit is implemented (Galp Energia, 2010b; Galp Energia, 2010c; Galp \n\nEnergia, 2011b). \n\nToday, Matosinhos refinery has a storage capacity of 1.78 million m\n3\n, approximately, of \n\nwhich 649000 m\n3\n are for different crude oils and 1.132 million m\n\n3 \nare for intermediate and \n\nfinal products. It is responsible for the production of fuels (3700000 ton/year), base oils \n\n(150000 ton/year), aromatics and solvents (440000 ton/year), lube oils (1500 ton/year), \n\nparaffins (10000 ton/year), bitumen (150000 ton/year) and sulfur (10000 ton/year). \n\nBesides, it is responsible for the production of important raw materials (e.g. chemical \n\nnaphtha, base oils, aromatic solvents, fuel oils, etc.) for other important industries as the \n\nchemical, petrochemical, plastics, textiles, fertilizers and paints. The production of all these \n\ndifferent products are only possible due to the existence of different and complex \n\noperations that are performed in different process units, integrated in five different \n\nfactories (Galp Energia, 2010b). These factories are: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n1. Lubes plant - in this area the main purpose is the production of lubricating oils and \n\ngreases from paraffinic base oils;  \n\n \n\n2. Aromatics plant \u2013 consuming reformate, which is its principal raw material, this factory \n\nis responsible for the production of important raw materials for other industries as \n\npetrochemical; \n\n \n\n3. Base oil plant \u2013 production of base oils and other products like paraffins and bitumens \n\nusing the Arabian light crude oil as raw material; \n\n \n\n4. Fuels plant \u2013 using crude oil as raw material it is responsible for the production of a \n\ngreat variety of fuel products, some of them used as raw materials for the aromatic and \n\nsolvent plant. Some of the intermediate and final products produced at this plant were the \n\nbase to develop this project. \n\n \n\n5. Utilities plant \u2013 this part is very important in the correct operation for all other factories \n\nsince it is responsible for the production and distribution of energy and utilities. Without \n\nthe utilities plant the refinery doesn\u2019t operate. As visualized in Figure 2.6, in the flowsheet \n\nof Matosinhos refinery the facilities of the utilities plant (thermoelectric plant, treatment of \n\nboiler water, water cooling system,\u2026) are not evident. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6: Flowsheet of Matosinhos refinery (Galp Energia, 2011c). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n25 \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Fuel Plant \n\nThe fuel plant of Matosinhos started its activity in 1969. It has a distillation capacity of \n\n12000 ton/day and it produces different fuels important in the market, raw materials for the \n\naromatic and solvent plants and other products that are feedstock to the cracking unit of \n\nSines refinery. These products are obtained due to the existence of a great variety of \n\nprocesses at the fuel plant, such as physical separation, chemical treatment and conversion \n\nprocesses as the conversion of the molecular structure of certain hydrocarbons families. \n\nThe fuel plant, shown in Figure 2.7, is composed of a large set of unit processes which uses \n\ncrude oil as the main raw material (Galp Energia, 2011a). Initially, crude oil was subjected \n\nto an atmospheric distillation (3000 unit\n1\n\n) where the separation of the different \n\nhydrocarbons were promoted by heating, cooling and separation under specific \n\ntemperature and pressure conditions. The atmospheric distillation was fed by a mixture of \n\ndifferent crude oils with different characteristics with the idea to optimize and adjust the \n\nproduction to the market needs. As these obtained products do not meet the necessary \n\nspecifications to be marketed they are subsequently treated in different units passing \n\nthrough separation and conversion processes until commercial products are obtained. After \n\nthe atmospheric distillation, the intermediate products obtained were processed to obtain \n\nthe following final products: \n\n \n\n1. Gases. The light fraction resulting from the atmospheric distillation after treatment \n\n(3600 unit) is separated in a fuel gas and LPG stream. Before the production of fuel gas, \n\nthe light fraction is sent to the 1500 unit for an acid gas treatment. This unit is responsible \n\nfor the extraction of the sulfide gas (H2S), in several gas streams, by an absorption \n\nprocesses using diethanolamine (DEA). The obtained sulfide gas is then sent to the unit \n\nresponsible for the sulfur recovery (3800/10800 unit) and the fuel gas is sent to the fuel gas \n\nsystem in the refinery. Relatively to the LPG stream it is separated in commercial propane \n\nand butane; \n\n                                                           \n1\n Unit is referred as a unit process which comprises the fuels plant. As visualize in Figure 2.7 each process is \n\ncharacterized by a different number. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n26 \n \n\n2. Light gasoline. The light gasoline is sent to the gas oil/ hydrodesulfurization unit (1400 \n\nunit), to reduce the sulfur content. In this unit (1400 unit), a treatment with hydrogen and \n\nin the presence of an appropriate catalyst is necessary for the extraction of these \n\ncompounds. After the treatment, the light gasoline can be used in the production of other \n\nproducts; \n\n \n\n3. Heavy gasoline. With the intention to remove the sulfur compounds, the heavy gasoline \n\nis sent to the 1200 unit. In this unit a catalytic conversion of some compounds as sulfur, \n\noxygen, nitrogen and other contaminants occurs, after which they are removed. This only \n\noccurs under an atmosphere of hydrogen and in the presence of an appropriate catalyst. \n\nThe products obtained in this unit are heavy gasoline desulfurated, the light gasoline and \n\ngas. The heavy gasoline goes to the platforming unit (1300 and 3300 unit), the light \n\ngasoline goes to the gas oil/ hydrodesulfurization (1400 unit) while the gas flows are sent \n\nto the treatment unit (1600 unit). In the platforming unit the idea is to increase the octane \n\nnumber of the heavy gasoline. For that, the heavy gasoline desulfurated is blended with a \n\ngas stream rich in hydrogen and passes, due to the existence of a catalyst, by different \n\nchemical reactions. A gas rich in hydrogen, a mixture of propane and butane and a gasoline \n\nwith a high octane number (reformate) are obtained in this unit. The reformate is then used \n\nas feedstock to the aromatic plant and as blending in gasoline; \n\n \n\n4. Petroleum. After being obtained, petroleum atmospheric derived from the atmospheric \n\ndistillation and from storage is sent to the 1400 unit (gas oil/ petroleum \n\nhydrodesulfurization) for treatment. The main feedstock of this unit is a mixture of gas oil \n\nand petroleum which passes through a desulfurization process with hydrogen. The final \n\nproduct is used as blending for gas oil. Besides that, in this unit it is possible to treat the \n\nWhite-Spirit, a product from the base oil plant, that is widely used in other industries as \n\nthose of paints, solvents and resins; \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n5. Gas oil. With the intention to reduce the quantity of sulfur, the gas oil is sent to the gas \n\noil desulfurization unit (3700 unit). For that the gas oil passes through a \n\nhydrodesulfurization process in the presence of hydrogen and an appropriate catalyst. \n\nAlthough, gas oil can also be sent to the 1400 unit; \n\n \n\n6. Residue from the atmospheric distillation unit. To increase the conversion of the \n\nheaviest fractions with lower commercial value, the residue from the atmospheric \n\ndistillation unit is sent to the vacuum distillation unit (10000 unit). Here the atmospheric \n\nresidue, which comes from the atmospheric distillation and from storage, is processed at a \n\nlower pressure than the atmospheric one. Heavy vacuum gas oil (HVGO), medium vacuum \n\ngas oil (MVGO), light vacuum gas oil (LVGO) and vacuum residue are the products \n\nobtained after the vacuum distillation. Normally, HVGO can be used as feedstock of a \n\ncatalytic cracking or of a hidrocracking unit. The MVGO is mixed with HVGO and then \n\nsent to storage while the LVGO can be used as feedstock in the gas oil desulfurization unit \n\n(3700 unit). The residue from the vacuum distillation unit goes to the visbreaker unit \n\n(10100 unit). The visbreaker unit is used for increasing the conversion of the heavier \n\nfractions into light fractions such as gasoline and gas oil and to decrease the viscosity of \n\nthe residue from the vacuum distillation unit. For that, a thermal cracking process taking \n\ninto account the temperature and the residence time is used. \n\n \n\nWith the description of all processes necessary for the production of final products with \n\ncommercial value it is possible to conclude that crude oil needs to pass through different \n\nphysical-chemical operations, with high complexity, to be used by the end consumer. It is \n\nthis complexity that gives a refinery its very own characteristics and potentialities.  \n\nFrom all the processes which were presented from the fuels plant, the vacuum (10000 unit) \n\nand visbreaker (10100 unit) units are considered the most important for this project as the \n\nmain idea is to analyse the products obtained when upgrading the \u201cbottom of barrel\u201d. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7: Flowsheet of the fuels plant of Matosinhos refinery (Galp Energia, 2011a). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n2.3. Upgrading the \u201cBottom of Barrel\u201d \n\nNowadays, the great challenge for the crude oil refining industry is to refine large \n\nquantities of heavy crude oils and to transform them into specific sets of refined products \n\nto meet the market demands (Wauquier, 1995). This means that all crude mixtures should \n\nbe converted from heavy fractions to light distillate products in multiple complex refining \n\nsteps, including distillation (atmospheric and vacuum distillation), catalytic cracking, \n\nhydrocracking, coking (Altgelt et al., 1994) and other processes as previously stated. \n\nVacuum distillation and visbreaking are processes used to convert the heavy fractions or \n\nresidues to light distillate products. These heavy fractions, called bottom-of-the-barrel, \n\ngained significant importance due to the increase in competitiveness in the markets, the \n\ncontinual increase in the crude oil prices, the increase into the global energy consumption \n\nand the demand for transportation fuels.  \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Vacuum Distillation  \n\nThe vacuum distillation unit receives the residue from the atmospheric distillation unit to \n\nrecover additional distillates. This distillation occurs under high vacuum conditions in a \n\nvacuum column where very low pressure is guaranteed (Jones et al., 2006). One of the \n\nmain advantages of this distillation is that it allows the distillation of the residue using \n\nlower temperatures comparing with the atmospheric distillation. At these temperatures, the \n\nthermal cracking of the components does not occur as easily, although if occurring, it can \n\nlead to the formation of coke and olefinic products (Jones et al., 2006). The presence of \n\ncoke is undesirable due to coke deposits formed in the pieces of equipment and piping, \n\nwhich reduces the process unit run-time and increases the maintenance costs.  \n\nA typical vacuum distillation includes a preheating system, a furnace, a vacuum column, a \n\ntop system, an amine absorber and a tempered water system (see Figure 2.8). With the \n\npreheating the residue from the atmospheric distillation unit reaches the adequate \n\ntemperature before entering in the furnace. At the furnace and, before to be sent to the \n\nvacuum column, the heating and the vaporization of the residue occur. When the residue \n\ngoes to the flash zone, in the column, to ensure maximum distillate yield, the temperature \n\nshould be higher and the pressure lower (Speight, 2006). The acid gas is cooled to remove \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n30 \n \n\nthe water from the condensate hydrocarbons and subsequently sent to the amine absorber \n\nto produce the off-gas stream which is then sent to the furnace. The obtained liquid \n\nfractions are the light vacuum gas oil (LVGO), medium vacuum gas oil (MVGO), the \n\nheavy vacuum gas oil (HVGO) and the vacuum residue. In Matosinhos refinery the LVGO \n\ncan be used as cutter stock of fuel oil or it can be sent to the gas oil desulfurization unit. \n\nThe MVGO and HVGO are sent together to storage or can also be used as cutter stock of \n\nfuel oil. The residue from the vacuum distillation unit is the raw material of the visbreaker \n\nunit (Galp Energia, 2011a). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8: Example of a vacuum unit (Galp Energia, 2011a). \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Visbreaker Unit \n\nThe visbreaking is an example of a thermal cracking process, with moderate severity, \n\nwhich contributes to the reduction of the pour point of a waxy residue and to the reduction \n\nof the viscosity of the residue from the vacuum distillation unit and other similar fractions \n\nfor values that allows its use as a fuel oil component (Singh et al., 1990; Speight, 2006). \n\nBesides residual fuel oil, gas, naphtha and gas oil are also formed with the thermal \n\ndecomposition of hydrocarbons (Jones et al., 2006; Joshi et al., 2008). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n31 \n\n \n\nA typical visbreaker unit includes a furnace, a reactor (for example a \u201csoaker\u201d reactor) and \n\na fractionation column (Meyers, 2004) (see Figure 2.9). The feed, the residue from the \n\natmospheric or vacuum distillation units, is preheated and partially cracked in the \n\nvisbreaker unit. Then, the feed is sent to the reaction section which is constituted by a \n\nheater and a soaking drum. In the heater a mild thermal cracking process occurs where the \n\nseverity can be controlled by the temperature level. In the soaking drum, a reaction time is \n\nprovided to obtain the desired conversion. Normally an extra residence time is provided \n\nwith the intention to have a heater operating at lower temperatures, thereby saving on fuel \n\nconsumption. However, it is important to have in attention that with these conditions a \n\ndecoking operation may occur, here the solution is to have the appropriate equipment or a \n\ngood practice in coke removal and handling. Afterwards, the effluent of the reaction \n\nsection is sent to the fractionation column where the separation of the products occurs, \n\ntaking into account its boiling point. Naphtha, gas, gas oil and residue are the products \n\nobtained in the visbreaker unit (Galp Energia, 2011a). Sometimes, when the idea is to \n\nreduce the quantity of lighter cutter stock which is mixed with the visbroken residue to \n\nmeet viscosity specifications, instead of removing the gas oil as a product it can be \n\nintegrated with the visbroken residue. Thereby, naphtha, gas and residue are the only \n\nproducts obtained from this unit. The visbroken residue is used to produce the fuel oil \n\n(Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). \n\nThe visbreaker severity is determined by the stability of the fuel oil produced from the \n\nblending of cutter stock into the visbroken residue. The fuel oil stability can give an idea \n\nrelatively to the blending of fuel oils without the occurrence of asphaltenes precipitation \n\n(Dente et al., 1997). The stability and compatibility of the visbroken residue can be affect \n\nby the chemical nature of the residue from the vacuum distillation unit (Somov et al., \n\n1999). An aromatic residue from the vacuum distillation unit is preferred to a paraffinic \n\none, once the aromatic ones have high solvent power and contribute to the stability of the \n\nvisbroken residue.  \n\nDuring visbreaking process there are some reactions that may occur, namely, cracking \n\nreactions, dehydrogenation, cyclization, aromatization, condensation, among others \n\n(Meyers, 2004). With these reactions: i) the paraffin chain suffer C-C splitting reactions, \n\nwhich contributes to the reduction in their carbon number, normally from 50 to 30 carbons \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n32 \n \n\nin saturates, and in the formation of olefinic molecules; ii) some aromatics and resins \n\ncompounds go through dealkylation reactions suffering a reduction in chain length and in \n\nthe quantity of naphthenic rings, while other compounds undergo condensation reactions \n\nresulting in carbon number increasing; iii) it is possible that resins undergo substitutive \n\naddition reactions but when the residence time is shorter, in visbreaking, these reactions \n\ncan be ignored; iv) asphaltenes undergo dealkylation and condensation reactions; and v) \n\nthe quantity of corrosive compounds (carboxylic and naphthenic acids) is reduced due to \n\nthe existence of decarboxylation reactions (Dente et al., 1997; Joshi et al., 2008; Kulkarni \n\net al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010). Summarizing, during these reactions there is a reduction \n\nin the saturate and resin contents, an increase in the aromatic content and an increase in \n\nasphaltene content (Somov et al., 1999). \n\nThe reactions, previously referred, strongly depend on the main operative variables of the \n\nvisbreaker unit as the temperature, pressure and the residence time. Normally small \n\npressures and higher temperatures contribute to the formation of low molecular weight \n\ncompounds, olefinic hydrocarbons with two to four carbons, due to the favoured reactions \n\nin gaseous phase. When using higher pressures and moderate temperatures the thermal \n\ndecomposition is smaller and in these cases the formation of products presenting a \n\ndistillation similar to the distillation of gasoline and gas oil is predominant. The existence \n\nof higher residence time contributes to the formation of coke due to the occurrence of \n\ncondensation and polymerizations reactions. Moreover, using higher residence time and \n\nsmaller temperatures also contributes to higher yields of coke. Relatively low temperatures \n\nand moderate residence times are very important to reduce coke formation, but essential to \n\nhave the desired conversion and a unit working for a desired time (Speight, 2006). The \n\nmost favourable is to have a visbreaker unit working with an adequate severity, this means, \n\ngood conditions that do not compromise the stability of the visbroken residue, do not \n\ncontribute to the formation and deposition of coke in pipelines and equipments and to \n\nobtain a significant amount of distillates. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9: Example of a vacuum \u2013 visbreaker unit (Galp Energia, 2011a).\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n34 \n \n\n2.4. Crude Oil Derivatives \n\nBetween all products obtained from the vacuum and visbreaker units, LVGO, HVGO and \n\nfuel oil are considered in this project (see Figure 2.10). Since fuel oil is a final product it is \n\nvery important to control its characteristics and quality. Producing fuel oil with the correct \n\nspecifications and without having product loss is one of the goals of the refinery. The \n\ncharacterization of LVGO and HVGO is considered very important to control the right \n\noperation of the vacuum column. Since the residue from the vacuum distillation unit \n\ncannot be sampled at the Matosinhos refinery, the analysis of these two streams will be \n\nvery important to understand and control the unit operation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10: Flowsheet of the vacuum and visbreaker unit of Matosinhos refinery. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Vacuum Gas Oil (LVGO and HVGO) \n\nVacuum gas oil produced by conversion of residue from the atmospheric distillation unit \n\nincludes light vacuum gas oil (LVGO), medium vacuum gas oil (MVGO) and heavy \n\nvacuum gas oil (HVGO). Vacuum gas oil has a boiling point over 345 \u00baC with the LVGO \n\npresenting a boiling point of 345 to 400 \u00baC, the MVGO of 400 to 430 \u00baC and the HVGO of \n\n430 to 540 \u00baC (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). Normally, vacuum gas oil is used as feedstock \n\nto the catalytic cracking unit to be converted to a lower boiling point fractions as jet and \n\ndiesel fuels (Kapur et al., 2005; Speight, 2006). \n\n \n\nLight vacuum gas oils is a mixture of 40-49 wt% of saturate compounds, typically 50 \n\nwt% of aromatic compounds and 1-10 wt% of polar compounds. The saturate compounds \n\nwith a carbon number typically from C15 to C30 are mainly paraffins and alkylnaphthenes \n\npresenting 1 to 4 rings. The aromatic ones are essentially: i) alkylbenzenes, naphthalenes \n\nand phenanthrenes with or without naphthenic rings; and ii) aromatics with substantial \n\namounts of heterocompounds with sulfur. Relatively to the polar compounds, they are \n\nreferred as compounds presenting nitrogen or/and oxygen. LVGO is characterized as more \n\naromatic, when compared with atmospheric gas oil, due to have a higher molecular weight \n\nand higher concentration of heteroatoms (Altgelt et al., 1994). \n\n \n\nHeavy vacuum gas oils presents a higher molecular weight and higher heteroatom content \n\ncompared to LVGO. Normally, HVGO has a carbon number typically from C20 to C50, \n\nmeaning higher carbon number and longer alkyl chains. HVGO is a mixture of 32 wt% of \n\nsaturates, 58 wt% of aromatics, 10 wt% of polar compounds and small percentages of other \n\nderivatives. It contains: i) aromatic and polar compounds with 1-3 aromatic rings as well as \n\nnaphthenic rings; ii) heterocompounds types with more aromatic rings; iii) \n\nheterocompounds bearing several functional groups, such as amides, sulfoxides, carboxylic \n\nacids and hydroxycarboxylic acids; and iv) some other nitrogen and oxygen compounds. \n\nOnce again, comparing with LVGO, HVGO has an increase in aromatics and polar content \n\nand a reduction in saturate compounds (Altgelt et al., 1994). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n36 \n \n\n2.4.2. Fuel Oil \n\nFuel oils (also called No. 6 fuel oil, Bunker C oil or residual fuel oil) are produced from the \n\ndistillation residues and/or visbroken residues by blending cutter stocks (Speight, 2006). \n\nBesides the residual fuel oil, there is another type of fuel oil, the distillate fuel oil. This \n\ntype of fuel oil, which it is vaporized and condensed during a distillation process, is \n\ncharacterized for having a definite boiling point range and for the absence of high boiling \n\npoint oils or asphaltic components. However, these two terms are no longer used and were \n\nreplaced by terms referring to the use of fuel oil such as domestic fuel oils, diesel fuel oils \n\nand heavy fuel oils, once the production of fuel oils have now in attention specific uses and \n\ncan be distillates or/and residuals. The domestic fuel oils, the most used at home, includes \n\nkerosene, stove oil and furnace fuel oil. Such fuel oils are example of distillate fuel oils. \n\nThe diesel fuel oils, other example of distillate fuel oils, includes diesel oil for diesel \n\ncompression ignition and light heating oil for industrial and commercial uses. Heavy fuel \n\noils include all residual fuel oils blended with distillates such as some industrial oils and \n\nthe bunker oils used to fuel ships (Speight, 2002; Speight, 2006). \n\nFuel oils are normally used for heating and processing in some power plants, marine \n\nvessels and industrial furnaces (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003; Nielsen et al., 2008), and in \n\nsteam generation providing mechanical energy that can be used for electrical power \n\ngeneration and propulsion (Speight, 2002). They are characterized for presenting a very \n\ncomplex composition of different hydrocarbons rich in paraffinic, naphthenic, olefinic, and \n\npolycyclic hydrocarbons as asphaltenes and for presenting a higher quantity of impurities, \n\ncompared with distillate fuels. It is possible to find in their composition other compounds \n\nas sulfur, nitrogen and heavy metals such as nickel and vanadium (Simanzhenkov et al., \n\n2003; Nielsen et al., 2008). One of the problems associated with fuel oils is normally \n\nrelated with the specifications that it needed to respect, as example, sulfur content due to \n\nenvironmental implications, the viscosity due to transportation and storage and the carbon \n\nresidue due to carbon formation and deposition under thermal conditions (Speight, 2002; \n\nSimanzhenkov et al., 2003). The difficulty is to find out what are the best cutter stock that \n\ncan be blended with the visbroken residue to obtain a homogeneous, stable residual fuel oil \n\nthat respects the specifications. There are different cutter stocks that can be used, e.g. \n\nkerosene, light cycle oil (LCO), visbroken gas oil and LVGO, but it is important to have in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nattention its nature. An aromatic cutter stock is preferred over a paraffinic one that \n\ndecreases fuel oil stability. \n\n \n\n2.4.3. Physical-Chemical Characterization of Petroleum Fractions \n\nAs previously mentioned during the conversion of petroleum into petroleum fractions, \n\nLVGO, HVGO and fuel oil, there are many processes and reactions occurring. In detail, \n\nthere are some large molecules breaking into smaller ones, there are heteroatoms that have \n\nto be removed and there are the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds and cracking \n\nreactions of naphthenes into paraffins and isoparaffins occurring. Concluding, there is a \n\nneed to routine control composition of these heavy fractions to obtain knowledge of \n\nconstituent components, information about the molecular level composition of the product \n\nand its effect on performance properties. This kind of information can improve refine \n\noperations, even contribute to the preservation of precious resources, minimize energy and \n\ncontribute to the reduction of pollution problems. Besides the difficulty associated with the \n\ncomposition analysis, due to the complex and heterogeneous mixture that characterized \n\nthese fractions, the potential benefits obtained are even greater. The main limitation \n\nassociated with these heavy fractions, as previously mentioned, are the complexity of the \n\nmixture characterized for having thousands of compounds, hydrocarbons and \n\nheterocompounds, ranging in carbon number and relative quantity. For this reason, it is \n\nexpected that each heavy fraction presents different compositions, and in consequence, \n\ndifferent physical-chemical properties. Density, kinematic viscosity, pour point, carbon \n\nresidue, sulfur content, among others, are some examples of properties that are important \n\nto describe, analyse and evaluate (Wauquier, 1995). Normally these properties are obtained \n\ntaking into account ASTM methods and other traditional tests (Table 2.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n38 \n \n\nTable 2.3: ASTM methods and other tests used in the characterization of petroleum fractions. \n\nPetroleum Fraction Properties ASTM method \n\nLVGO \n\nDensity (g/cm\n3\n) ASTM D1298 \n\nSulfur content (% m/m) IP 336 \n\nKinematic viscosity (cSt) ASTM D445 \n\nASTM distillation (\u00baC) ASTM D86 \n\nFlash point (\u00baC) ASTM D93 \n\nHVGO \n\nDensity (g/cm\n3\n) ASTM D1298 \n\nSulfur content (% m/m) IP 336 \n\nKinematic viscosity (cSt) ASTM D445 \n\nCarbon residue (% m/m) ASTM D4530 \n\nVanadium ASTM D1548 \n\nNickel IP 285 \n\nASTM distillation (\u00baC) ASTM D1160 \n\nFlash point (\u00baC) ASTM D93 \n\nFuel Oil \n\nDensity (g/cm\n3\n) ASTM D1298 \n\nKinematic viscosity (cSt) ASTM D445 \n\nSulfur content (% m/m) IP 336 \n\nFlash point (\u00baC) ASTM D93 \n\nP-value SMS 1600 \n\nCarbon residue (% m/m) ASTM D4530 \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Kinematic viscosity \n\nThe kinematic viscosity in fluid, expressed in centistokes (cSt), is a measure of its \n\nresistance to flow. The kinematic viscosity depends on the temperature and when the \n\ntemperature increases the kinematic viscosity decreases. The decrease in kinematic \n\nviscosity, when the temperature increases, may be related to the energy that the fluid \n\nmolecules have to create a hole in the liquid contributing to their movement in or out of the \n\nliquid. The kinematic viscosity also depends on the composition of the sample in analysis, \n\ne.g. depends on the heteroatom content, the aromatic ring condensation and the interactions \n\nthat may occur. As example, a paraffinic fraction normally is characterized for having low \n\nviscosity due to the lower interactions occurring even in fractions with a high boiling point \n\n(Altgelt et al., 1994; Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). The analysis of the kinematic viscosity \n\ndata can give important information relatively to fuel transfer, storage and other that \n\ncontributes to an efficient combustion (Speight, 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n2. Density \n\nDensity is a very important property used when it is desirable to make conversions \n\nbetween mass (weight) and volume measurements. This property, very easy to measure, \n\ncan be a good indicator of fuel quality and, moreover, it can be correlated with aromaticity, \n\nnaphthenicity and paraffinity. On the other hand, this propriety is applied in product \n\ncontrol, e.g. this is not a property that is used to evaluate the performance of the product \n\nbut it is used in the product control and in the weight-volume relationship. Normally, this \n\nproperty, expressed in g/cm\n3\n, is determined at standard temperatures, 15 or 20 \u00baC (Speight, \n\n2002). \n\n \n\n3. Carbon residue \n\nCarbon residue is defined as an indicator of coking propensity. It provides information \n\nrelatively to the tendency of hydrocarbons that have difficult combustion characteristics, \n\ne.g. the amount of coke or carbonaceous type deposits that can be formed during exposure \n\nto thermal effects. Normally there is an increase in the amount of deposits during \n\ncombustion process in cases where the quantity of carbon is higher and consequently its \n\nburning is hard. There also exist a correlation between carbon residue and H/C ratio. The \n\nsmaller the H/C ratio the higher the percentage of carbon residue (Simanzhenkov et al., \n\n2003). \n\n \n\n4. Flash point \n\nFlash point can be defined as the temperature needed for the vapors of a fuel ignite when a \n\ntest flame is applied. This property gives important information relatively to safety during \n\nstorage, transportation and contamination by more volatile products. The presence of \n\ncontamination normally leads to a lower flash point than expected. For fuel oil, the flash \n\npoint has to be more than 60 \u00baC (Speight, 2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n40 \n \n\n5. Sulfur content \n\nSulfur content normally is related with crude oil origin and with the refining process. \n\nDuring combustion process and in the presence of an excess of air, temperature and \n\npressure, sulfur is converted into sulfur oxides as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfur trioxide \n\n(SO3). These sulfur oxides in the presence of humidity are responsible for the formation of \n\nsulfurous acid (H2SO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). However, these acids are undesirable \n\ndue to corrosion problems. For these reasons, the use of fuels with high sulfur content can \n\ncontribute to the development of corrosion problems as equipment damages, air pollution \n\nand acid water due to the emission of SOx in the atmosphere, contamination of the catalyst \n\nand are toxic (Speight, 2002; Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). These problems were the \n\nreasons for the development of new processes and technologies to decrease the sulfur \n\ncontent and sulfur emissions. \n\n \n\n6. Metal content \n\nNormally, vanadium and nickel are the most commonly found in some heavy fuel oil \n\nmolecules such as in the asphaltenes. With combustion processes it is possible to find some \n\nvanadiumoxides. The existences of double oxides/sulfates with sodium are the most critical \n\nproblem. Currently, there are some additives and treatments that can be used to prevent the \n\nexistence of these compounds in high quantities (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n7. Pour point \n\nPour point is described as the lowest temperature at which an oil will continue to flow \n\nwhen it is cooled under specified standard conditions. In the indication of the pour point of \n\nan oil, it is very important to know the temperature that is achieved to transfer the oil from \n\none place to another and even in storage conditions. When the oil is kept at a temperature \n\nbelow of its pour point it is possible that wax crystallizes. The presence of wax can lead to \n\nthe obstruction of filters and can be deposited on heat exchangers. However, even when the \n\npour point specification is met, it is possible that wax settling occur. For this reason and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPETROLEUM INDUSTRY \n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nwhen there are large changes in temperature it is very important to pay attention to diesels \n\nwith a higher heavier n-paraffins content (Speight, 2002; Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n8. Peptization value (P-value) \n\nThe P-value method describes a way for quantifying the intrinsic stability of the \n\nasphaltenes in a fuel oil. The stability of asphaltenes depends on its own nature and on its \n\nchemical environment such as on the aromatic content and on the molecular mass of the \n\nasphaltenes. Incompatibility and instability of fuel oils usually results from the \n\nprecipitation of the asphaltenes. Asphaltenes are the molecules in crude oil containing \n\nhigher concentrations of detrimental compounds, such as, vanadium, nickel, sulfur and \n\nnitrogen. They have a negative effect in the production, transportation and oil processing, \n\nand consequently the elimination of these molecules is one of the main objectives of the \n\nrefineries. This method is not only useful to analyse the stability/instability between fuel \n\noils, as it is a way to analyse the effect of the addition of cutter stocks to visbroken residues \n\nin order to reduce the viscosity. An aromatic cutter stock that contributes to keep the \n\nasphaltenes dispersed provides a good stability reserve.  \n\n \n\n9. Distillation  \n\nThe distillation is one of the most important separation processes considered as an \n\nalternative way to determine boiling ranges of refined products using smaller samples and \n\nsmaller operation times. It consists in the separation of individual hydrocarbons taking into \n\naccount differences in their boiling point (Altgelt et al., 1994). Distillation characteristics \n\nof hydrocarbons give important information relatively to their safety and performance, \n\nespecially in the case of fuels and solvents. Information on the boiling point range is very \n\nuseful to understand the composition and behaviour of the samples during storage and use, \n\nwhile the rate of evaporation plays an important role in the application of different solvents \n\n(ISO Standards 3405, 2011). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n \n\n42 \n \n\n2.5. Final Remarks \n\nThe implementation of new processes to increase the production of products with high \n\ncommercial value and to take advantage of the heaviest part of crude oil, the residuum, \n\ncontribute to the formation of vacuum gas oil (HVGO and LVGO) and fuel oil. The \n\nvacuum gas oil is used as feedstock to other process units to be converted to a lower \n\nboiling point fraction, as jet and diesel fuels, while the fuel oil is a final product used for \n\nheating and processing in some power plants, marine vessels and industrial furnaces and in \n\nsteam generation providing mechanical energy that can be used for electrical power \n\ngeneration and propulsion. The characterization of these heavy fractions is a challenge due \n\nto its complex mixture rich in thousands of compounds. Furthermore, the knowledge of \n\nsuch composition can be very useful in controlling the process and in the production of \n\nfinal products with desirable characteristics. For such characterization different ASTM \n\nmethods and other traditional tests are used. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\nCCHHRROOMMAATTOOGGRRAAPPHHIICC  AANNDD  \n\nSSPPEECCTTRROOSSCCOOPPIICC  AANNAALLYYSSIISS  OOFF  \n\nPPEETTRROOLLEEUUMM  FFRRAACCTTIIOONNSS  WWIITTHH  \n\nEEMMPPHHAASSIISS  IINN  NNMMRR\n22\n  \n\n \n\n                                                           \n2\n The contents of this chapter were adapted from Silva, S.L., Silva, A.M.S., Ribeiro, J.C., Martins, F.G., Da Silva, F.A., \n\nSilva, C.M., 2011.

These progresses can improve the refining industries \n\noperation as a result of better knowledge on the petroleum composition that is fed in the refining process, as \n\nwell as in the prediction of better operating conditions to obtain refined products with desired specifications and \n\nin quantities desirable to meet the markets demands. The improvement in the refining operation conditions are \n\nreflected in economic benefits. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.

Chromatographic and Spectroscopy Characterization of Petroleum \n\nFractions \n\nThere are different methods classifying the chemical compounds present in petroleum \n\nwhich allows to draw some conclusions concerning their properties. Until now most of the \n\nmethods used to analyse petroleum fractions are chromatographic methods, like gas \n\nchromatography (Beens et al., 2000), high-performance liquid chromatography \n\n(Boduszynski, 1988), thin-layer chromatography, and some spectroscopic techniques like \n\ninfrared (Sastry et al., 1996), Raman (Ahmadjian et al., 1976), and NMR spectroscopy and \n\nalso mass spectrometry (Boduszynski, 1987). \n\n \n\n3.1.1. Gas Chromatography (GC) \n\nGC is used in the separation and analysis of complex mixtures of many components that \n\ncan be vaporized without decomposition. In the GC technique the sample is carried \n\nthrough the column by the moving phase (a gas). The rate taken by the chemical \n\nconstituents of the sample to pass through the column depends on their physical-chemical \n\nproperties and on the interaction with the stationary phase (liquid or solid) of the column. \n\nThe time taken for each compound to leave the column is called the retention time. The \n\nquantity of separated substances which coming out from the column are detected and \n\nrepresented by an electronic signal. These signals are detected by some detectors as the \n\nflame ionization detector (FIDr), flame photometric detector (FPD) and the thermal \n\nconductivity detector (TCD), having different sensitivity (smallest quantity of compounds \n\nin analysis) and selectivity (type of compound). FIDr is very sensitive and selective just for \n\nsome compounds, used in the analysis of organic substances as benzene in gasoline \n\naccording to the ASTM D3606 method (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). The FPD is used in \n\nthe identification of organic compounds containing sulfur or phosphorus as heavily \n\nbiodegraded spill samples (Butt et al., 1986). TCD is not very sensitive but very selective \n\nin detecting everything (Speight, 2001) while FIDr is preferred in the analyses of crude oil \n\nfractions or products (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). GC studies, using TCD detector, have \n\nproven that the mixture components are not destroyed during the analysis and just a small \n\namount of the material is needed, while in the case of FIDr and FPD detectors the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n46 \n \n\ncompounds are destroyed (Kenkel, 1994). Beyond FIDr, FPD and TCD there are other \n\ndetectors, as electron trap detector and nitrogen/phosphorous thermo ionic detector, which \n\ncan be used depending on the exactly compound under investigation. In spite of the \n\nadvantages that can be achieved with the GC technique, due to the short time needed to \n\nmake an analysis and the required small amount of sample, it is possible to conclude that \n\nthis method is not widely used for the analysis of heavy crude fractions since all \n\ncompounds analysed by GC must be in the gaseous phase and need to have a boiling \n\ntemperature less than 350 \u00baC (Altgelt et al., 1994; Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). The \n\nproblem is that only the light fractions, as gasoline, kerosene and gas oil, have a boiling \n\npoint smaller than 350 \u00baC. For the heaviest ones, as residue, the distillation temperatute is \n\nmuch higher, over 350 \u00baC. This method is rather used when in presence of light (Figure \n\n3.1) and middle distillates (de Andrade et al., 2010). Moreover, it is also applied to obtain \n\nthe true boiling point distribution of distillates and crude oils. This simulated distillation \n\nhas been developed to simulate the time-consuming true boiling point distillation relating \n\nthe retention time with the distillation temperatures of the hydrocarbon components. \n\nExample of two standardized methods of simulated distillation are the ASTM D2887 for \n\nthe analysis of gaseous boiling range (ASTM Standards D2887, 2013) and the ASTM \n\nD5307 for the determination of boiling range distribution of crude petroleum (ASTM \n\nStandards D5307, 2007). Other examples on the application of GC for the crude oil \n\ncharacterization are the ASTM D2163 for the determination of hydrocarbons in liquefied \n\npetroleum gases and propane mixtures (ASTM Standards D2163, 2007), ASTM D2427 \n\nmethod to determine the composition of gasoline (ASTM Standards D2427, 2011) and \n\nASTM D3606 method for the aviation gasoline (ASTM Standards D3606, 2010). \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1: Example of a GC chromatogram of a light Nigerian crude (fraction with a boiling temperature smaller than \n\n343 \u00baC).

High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) \n\nHPLC is characterized by using high pressure to force chemical compounds to pass the \n\ncolumn (metal tube) containing a stationary phase. This column has very thin particles that \n\ncontribute to an efficient separation. HPLC is an important tool for the analysis of \n\ncompounds that do not present enough volatility to be analysed by GC. Besides the \n\nsimilarities between HPLC and GC, there are compounds analysed by HPLC but not by \n\nGC. A crude with 80% of heavy fractions needs temperatures above 350 \u00baC to vaporise, \n\nthus is more efficiently analysed with HPLC than with GC. The possibility to obtain a \n\ngood and efficient separation of heavy oil fractions and a very precise analysis in a very \n\nshort time are the main advantages of HPLC. The main disadvantage of HPLC is that \n\ndepending on the used detector [e.g. UV absorption (UV), refractive index (RI) or \n\nfluorescence (F)] there are some compounds which are impossible to distinguish. UV and \n\nF spectrophotometries only detect some species, F only detects fluorescent species while \n\nRI has the ability to analyse all compounds. However, the RI detectors are less sensitive \n\nthan the UV detectors and strongly dependent on the temperature of the sample (Kenkel, \n\n1994). HPLC is a chromatography technique scarcely used in the analysis of crude oils \n\nsince the objective is using one technique that provides precise analysis of every \n\ncomponent in a very short time, like minutes, if possible. When the objective is analysing \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n48 \n \n\ngroup of compounds, such as paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic compounds, HPLC \n\ncontinues to be a possibility, but to analyse individual compounds of crude oil the use of \n\nHPLC is inadequate. Besides that, HPLC does not give precise results when analysing \n\nhydrotreated and hydrocracked compounds, which present identical boiling point range. \n\nHowever, HPLC was used in the identification of molecular types in non-volatile \n\nfeedstocks, in the study of asphaltene fractions aiming to identify molecular species \n\n(Speight, 2001) and in the identification of aromatic groups (mono, di, tri- aromatics) \n\n(Pasadakis et al., 2001). HPLC is very important in fingerprinting oils and used in the \n\nidentification of vanadyl compounds (Fish et al., 1984). \n\n \n\n3.1.3. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) \n\nTLC like the other chromatographic techniques, GC and HPLC, also has a stationary and a \n\nmobile phase. Here the stationary phase is silica or alumina placed on a glass, aluminium \n\nor plastic plate unlike the GC and HPLC where this phase is located in the column. The \n\nmobile phase is a solvent or a mixture of solvents that are needed to help in the separation \n\nof compounds. Hexane, tetrachloromethane, benzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl \n\nacetate, dioxane, acetone, isobutanol, isopropanol, ethanol and methanol are example of \n\nsome used solvents. The use of mixture of solvents is desirable to ensure the properties \n\nneeded for the chromatographic separation. TLC is an analytical method that can be used \n\nwith other chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques to provide more information and \n\nanalytical data on the isolated compounds. The TLC is used in the separation of mixtures \n\nand is proven to be faster and to provide better separations. It is also a simpler and an \n\ninexpensive technique, when compared with the HPLC and GC. It is recommended in the \n\nanalysis of some organic substances. However, TLC is more often used in qualitative \n\nanalysis, and when necessary to identify isolated substances and the structure of the \n\ncompound other precise methods are required. Up to now, precise quantitative analysis \n\nwere not obtained by TLC (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). TLC is used in the analysis of \n\nheavy petroleum fractions, applied in the characterization of semi-volatile and non-volatile \n\nproducts and in the separation of compounds, such as asphaltenes, which present a high \n\nboiling point, proving to be simpler and quicker. Advances in TLC as TLC with flame-\n\nionization detection (TLC-FIDr) have been used when the purpose was to make a \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\ndistinction between hydrocarbon groups, such as saturates, aromatics and polars ones, in \n\nheavy oil as shown in Figure 3.2. Although, TLC presents some limitations as the \n\nimpossibility to distinguish between diesel and jet fuel, two very similar products (Speight, \n\n2006) and to give precise and accurate results. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2: Example of TLC-FIDr chromatograms of 500 N VGO cut and its fractions.

Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy \n\nIR spectroscopy is one of the most important techniques that can provide miscellaneous \n\ninformation of complex mixtures of compounds, such as information about hydrocarbon \n\nskeleton and functional groups (e.g. hydroxyl and carbonyl groups). It allows measuring a \n\ngreat number of structural parameters like paraffinic and naphthenic character, aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons and methyl group content and gives information about functional features of \n\nvarious petroleum constituents, nature of polymethylene chains and the nature of \n\npolynuclear aromatic systems. It also contributes to the aging determination of oils related \n\nto the oxidation of carboxylic acids (Gautam et al., 1998). The main advantage of this \n\ntechnique is the possibility to analyse the hydrogen bonding in the crude oil mixture. It is \n\npossible to say that the IR can give more qualitative rather than quantitative information \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n50 \n \n\nmaking impossible to detect some compounds. There is more limitations associate with \n\nthis technique like the overlap that occurs between frequency ranges, which can be \n\novercame by the use of NMR spectroscopy. There are some studies in the application of IR \n\nin the analysis of crude oil fractions (as Figure 3.3), but the implementation of this \n\ntechnique is more related with the study of middle distillates. An example is the \n\ndetermination of fatty methyl esters (FAME) content in middle distillates (European \n\nStandard EN 14078, 2009) and of benzene content in motor and aviation gasoline (ASTM \n\nStandards D4053, 2009), the method of carbon type analysis in lubricating oils (FORD \n\nStandards EU-AJ 051-01, 2001) and even the identification of chemical species as \n\ncontaminated species (by comparison IR spectra). Another example is the use of IR in the \n\nstudy of spilled oils (derivatives from crude), but only in the definition of the chemical \n\nclasses to which they belong, since the use of IR in the characterization and differentiation \n\nof different classes of hydrocarbons, from different heavy products, is difficult. In this \n\ncase, once again, IR should be combine with other spectroscopic techniques to predict such \n\nhydrocarbons (Butt et al., 1986). On the other hand, it is possible to use multivariate \n\nstatistical methods, such as the partial least squares regression (PLS) and principal \n\ncomponent analysis (PCA) to predict properties of the sample in analysis (Aske et al., \n\n2002) and with this establish correlations, which could be an improvement for online IR. \n\nAs it will be demonstrated in Chapter 5, these multivariate statistical methods were used in \n\ncombination with other spectroscopic technique to predict some petroleum fractions \n\nproperties. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3: Example of an IR spectrum of heavy fuel oil.

Raman Spectroscopy \n\nRaman spectroscopy is used to obtain information about the vibrations of molecular bonds \n\nin the sample and to measure the energy needed to change the ground state of a chemical \n\ncompound. The Raman effect occurs when there is a change in the molecular polarization, \n\nand can give more complete information than infrared spectroscopy. These two techniques \n\nare very similar in terms of results and can be used in combination to obtain more \n\ninformation about the analysis of petroleum samples (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). Raman \n\nspectroscopy is used in the analysis of aromatic and olefinic compounds in hydrocarbon \n\nmixtures, it does not need a sample preparation and is quicker. This technique is not \n\nconsidered the best choice for the characterization of crude oil, due to the weak signal \n\nobtained in the Raman spectrum. Another disadvantage of using Raman spectroscopy in \n\nthe analysis of crude oil may be related with the natural fluorescence, that leads to the \n\nimpossibility of identifying any signals when hydrocarbon components are irradiated by \n\nvisible lasers (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). Details of these methods are mostly found when \n\napplied to light elements as gasoline (as for example registered in Figure 3.4), gas oil, jet \n\nand kerosene and also when Raman is used in combination with Fourier transform (FT). \n\nThere are some studies on the use of FT-Raman spectroscopy in the determination of the \n\noctane number (RON), the motor octane number (MON), the pump octane number (pump) \n\nand the Reid vapour pressure (RVP) (Cooper et al., 1995). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n52 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4: Example of a Raman spectrum of a gasoline sample. Reprinted with permission from Process Instruments \n\n(2001).Copyright Process Instrument, Inc.. \n\n \n\n3.1.6. Mass Spectrometry (MS) \n\nMS can give information on the structure of some compounds, for example assigning their \n\nmolecular formula based on the molecular weight, contributing to the identification of \n\nsome compounds or to have an idea about new compounds. There are different MS \n\ntechniques that can be used, such as electron impact (EI), chemical ionization (CI), field \n\nionization (FI), fast atom bombardment (FAB), among others. EI-MS (electron impact \u2013 \n\nmass spectrometry) is a technique of major importance and is characterized by the \n\nexistence of a set of electrons with high energy that will contact with the molecules and \n\nwill be responsible for the ionization and fragmentation of these molecules (Kenkel, 1994). \n\nThis technique gives a fragmentation pattern exhibiting both parent ion peaks and \n\nfragmentation ion peaks, characteristic of each molecular type. The fragmentation is \n\nnormally used to distinguish between isomers of pure compounds and of molecules in \n\nsimple mixtures. For example, in alkyl chains the most pronounced fragments are caused \n\nby the loss of CH3\n?\n, C2H5\n\n?\n or C2H4\n\n?\n. Four carbons atoms are an example of a fragment that \n\nis most common in ions of paraffinic chains. Other examples of fragments are those of \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nhaving C3, C2 and C5. The monoalkylbenzenes are characterized by the fragment of C6H5\n?\n. \n\nBesides these examples, there are others related to monoalkylnaphthalenes, \n\nmonoalkylphenanthrenes, monocyclic alkanes and other molecules (Altgelt et al., 1994). \n\nSince heavy petroleum fractions are rich in thousands of compounds, it is expected that \n\ndue to such complexity and closely related compounds that the fragmentation patterns \n\nbecame crowded and impossible to distinguish. With this, EI-MS is not frequently used in \n\nthe analysis of heavy petroleum fractions. Therefore, the most common type of MS \n\ntechniques used in the analysis of heavy crude oil is the non-fragmenting (NF)-MS, also \n\ncalled \u201csoft ionization\u201d. These techniques produce simpler spectra compared with those \n\nresulting from the fragmentation (Skoog et al., 1997). For example, the hard fragmentation \n\nof aliphatic hydrocarbons does not follow a given pattern, making very difficult to identify \n\nthese compounds. Sulfur and nitrogen compounds and species with the same chemical \n\nformula are also difficult to analyse, while other compounds like the aromatics has a good \n\nbehaviour in the final spectra and are easy to identify, especially with \u201csoft-ionization\u201d \n\ntechniques. Recently, the combination of some \u201csoft-ionization\u201d techniques as the low-\n\nvoltage electron ionization, electrospray ionization (ESI), field desorption ionization (FDI) \n\nand atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) contributed to the development of FT-\n\nICR-MS (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry), which was used \n\nin the analysis of thousands of chemical constituents in heavy petroleum fractions. This \n\nnew technique has already been used, for example, in the analysis of polycyclic aromatic \n\nsulfur heterocycles in different Arabian crude oils, as shown in Figure 3.5 (Panda et al., \n\n2007). When the boiling point increases it becomes more difficult to use the MS in sample \n\nanalysis due to the increase in the number of types of compounds and the decrease in the \n\nconcentration of these compounds (Behera et al., 2008). Concluding, aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons, sulfur and nitrogen compounds are examples of compounds complicated to \n\nbe analysed by MS, and thus, to obtain information about all heavy crude oil fractions it is \n\nnecessary to use this technique conjugated with other complementary techniques. There is \n\na possibility to use MS hyphenated techniques, like GC-MS or HPLC-MS. In other words \n\na spectral method can be combined with chromatographic methods to exploit the \n\nadvantages of both and obtain better information about the sample in analysis. Besides the \n\nadvantageous that the MS hyphenated techniques can bring, normally a great diversity of \n\nstandards is required, which makes it a very expensive method.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n54 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5: Example of an ESI FT-ICR mass spectra of condensed thiophenes in different Arabian crude oils.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy  \n\nThe NMR spectroscopy has been proven to be a very important technique in the study of \n\nheavy petroleum fractions, considered increasingly as a potential alternative to some \n\nconventional methods used in laboratories. The problem with the laboratory methods, \n\nbased on traditional techniques, are normally time consuming, quite elaborated and \n\nexpensive if using expensive solvents and instruments (Bansal et al., 1998; Molina et al., \n\n2007). Regarding these facts, and taking into account that the determination of petroleum \n\nfraction properties are very important in process monitoring and in controlling the refining \n\noperation, there is a need to use known technologies to characterize petroleum fractions \n\nand to especially contribute in the reduction of the time and cost of analysis and also to \n\ngive online information. \n\nThe NMR spectroscopy has gained a prominent place in the study of the chemical \n\ncomposition of petroleum and in the characterisation of petroleum fractions. It has been \n\ndemonstrated that its use can provide an analysis in only a few minutes per stream, which \n\ncan be performed in a continuous and online way and has the ability to analyse dark and \n\nopaque samples, such as crude. It is a rapid and non-invasive procedure, offering great \n\nanalyses in the chemical nature of individual types of hydrogen and carbon atoms, in \n\ndifferent and complex mixtures of petroleum and in the final products obtained by refining \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nprocesses (Gautam et al., 1998). The analysis of different types of carbon atoms and \n\ngroups, like CH3, CH2, aromatic and aliphatic CH, aliphatic C and other C (Altgelt et al., \n\n1994) are possible. Besides the previously mentioned advantages there are other associated \n\nwith this technique including the improvement in the analysis, reduction in the number of \n\nanalysis, reduction in maintenance costs and unique ability to provide all control properties \n\nwith one analysis. \n\nAs mentioned by the Mesures Magazine (2002) the main advantages are the direct relation \n\nbetween the measured signal and the total proton concentration and the superior resolution \n\nof chemical information contained in the signals. In the NMR spectra the functional groups \n\nof aromatics, aliphatics and olefins are well distinguished, in consequence it is possible to \n\ndistinguish a polynuclear aromatic from a mononuclear aromatic and to identify the \n\nphysical properties by the concentration of aromatics and the chain length of aliphatics. \n\nBesides these advantages there also exist commercial and operational benefits associated to \n\nthe NMR spectroscopy. The commercial benefits are related to the optimization in the feed \n\nof refining processes to adjust the production taking into account the market necessity, to \n\nbenefit the attractive price of some crudes and in saving money by using complete systems \n\nof acquisition analysis in a short time. The operational benefits are to provide a higher \n\nvalue in product yields, maximize unit recovery of potential lost, due to instability, and \n\nimprove the performance of downstream units (The Qualion Company, 2006). On the other \n\nhand, there are some weaknesses associated with this spectroscopic technique like the high \n\ncost, the risk of magnetic disturbances, requiring magnetic shielding, and the overlap of \n\nfrequency ranges. The overlap continues to make the analysis of the spectra a very difficult \n\ntask. However improvements have been made to oppose these weaknesses as the use of \n\nsome spectral editing techniques (DEPT, GASPE, COSY, etc.). Also the very complex \n\ninformation given by NMR spectroscopy requires a statistical approach to correlate the \n\nspectral data with the characterization of petroleum fractions. The combination of NMR \n\nspectroscopy with multivariate data methods will be discussed in Chapter 5. \n\n \n\nIt is possible to conclude that there are some restrictions associate with all \n\nchromatographic and spectroscopic techniques discussed, making it unrealizable to analyse \n\nthe heavy petroleum fractions. However, the NMR has been suggested as one of the most \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n56 \n \n\npowerful methods for industrial analysis. Until now, NMR has been used in some refinery \n\nlaboratories with the purpose to determine: i) the content of oil in paraffins and aromatic \n\ncarbon contents of hydrocarbon oils by high resolution NMR (ASTM Standards D5292, \n\n1999); ii) the aromatic hydrogen and carbon content by high resolution NMR (IP Standards \n\n392, 1990); iii) the hydrogen content of middle distillate petroleum products by low-\n\nresolution pulsed NMR (ASTM Standards D7171, 2005); and iv) the aromatic carbon \n\ncontent of lubricant mineral base oils and middle distillate petroleum fractions by \n13\n\nC \n\nNMR spectroscopy (IP Standards 499, 2011). Besides the laboratory applications, online \n\nNMR systems have been used in many refineries around the world applied on the feed and \n\nproducts units for control and optimization (Bakeev, 2010). Examples of some applications \n\nare: i) NMR for gasoline analysis in Australia Caltex Brisbane refinery; ii) NMR to the \n\noptimization of a crude unit in Petr\u00f3leos De Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) - Isla refinery; iii) \n\nNMR for monitoring the feed, intermediate and final products of a lubricant oil \n\nmanufacturing plant in Livorno, Italy; and iv) most frequently in many other refineries, \n\nNMR is used in the analysis of feed and cracked products such as light cycle oil on fluid \n\ncatalytic cracking units (Bakeev, 2010). Examples of other applications are related to the \n\nuse of NMR well logging for real-time analysis of rock and fluid properties (Hirasaki et \n\nal., 2003; Ramos et al., 2009). Here, instead of using the \n1\nH or \n\n13\nC NMR spectra, the NMR \n\nwell logging measured both \n1\nH relaxation times and diffusion coefficient. This information \n\ncan be useful to distinguish between water, oil and gas content in reservoir fluids as well as \n\nto analyse the diffusion coefficients, porosity and estimate the oil viscosity, establishing \n\ndifferences between light to extra heavy crude oils. Crude oils are characterized for having \n\nbroad relaxation time and diffusivity distributions. The ones presenting lower relaxation \n\ntime are normally associated to a higher viscosity (Hirasaki et al., 2003; Ramos et al., \n\n2009).  \n\n \n\n3.2. NMR Spectroscopy - Overview \n\nThe NMR spectroscopy is a method based on the magnetic properties of nuclei and their \n\ninteractions with applied magnetic fields (Gil et al., 2002; Bakeev, 2010). The information \n\ngiven by the NMR spectroscopy, for each type of observed nuclei, depends either on the \n\nelectronic environment were the nuclei are immersed and on the positions of the nuclei in \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\nthe molecules. Therefore, the NMR data is very important to understand the molecular \n\nstructure of the sample as well as the internal and global dynamics of the molecules in the \n\nsample (Gil et al., 2002). \n\nThe nuclei observable by NMR are those possessing nuclear spin. Protons and neutrons, \n\nquantum mechanically subatomic particles, have spin. When the number of protons and \n\nneutrons is equal, it means that when in some nuclei these spins are paired and cancel each \n\nother out, the nucleus of the atom has no overall spin. Nuclei with an even atomic number \n\nand even mass number, such as the isotopes \n12\n\nC, \n16\n\nO and \n32\n\nS, are example of some nuclei \n\nwith a spin number equal to zero. However, the number of protons and neutrons is not \n\nalways equal and in many cases the sum of the number of protons and neutrons is an odd \n\nnumber, thus contributing to nuclei with half-integer spins. On the other hand, if the \n\nnumber of protons and the number of neutrons are both odd, then it gives rise to what is \n\ncalled the integer spin. Thus, the spin quantum number,  , can be 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 5/2, this \n\nis, it can be multiples of 1/2. The proton (\n1\nH) and carbon (\n\n13\nC) are examples of nuclei with \n\na spin       (Pavia et al., 1996; Gil et al., 2002; Bakeev, 2010). When the nuclei are \n\nspinning they possess angular momentum,  , and a nuclear charge which gives rise to an \n\nassociated magnetic moment,   (Equation 3.1), such as: \n\n \n\n      (3.1) \n \n\nwhere   presents the magnetogyric ratio, a constant for particular nuclei that represents the \n\nstrength of the magnetic moment. When the nuclei, without preferred orientation, are \n\nplaced under the influence of an external magnetic field of strength   , applied in a defined \n\ndirection, an interaction, commonly called the Zeeman interaction, between the magnetic \n\nmoment of the nucleus and the applied magnetic field occurs (Becker, 2000). \n\nConsequently, the magnetic moments will align themselves relative to the external \n\nmagnetic field into      energy states. Thus, the proton (\n1\nH) and all other nuclei having \n\na spin of      , when placed in a magnetic field, will have two allowed energy states \n\nthat equate to aligning with or against the applied magnetic field (Figure 3.6). However, \n\nfrom these two allowed energy states the nucleus can only adopt one, taking up one of the \n\ntwo possible orientations with respect to the applied external magnetic field, parallel \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n58 \n \n\n         or anti-parallel          (Christian et al., 1986; Gil et al., 2002). The \n\nparallel orientation, the one towards the magnetic field, is more stable while the anti-\n\nparallel orientation, opposed to the applied field, is of higher energy.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6: Representation of the possible energy levels for nuclei with spin of      .

Copyright 2010 John Wiley and Sons. \n\n \n\nThe magnetic moments cannot align directly along the axis of the applied magnetic field \n\ndue to the torque imposed by the applied field on the magnetic moments. The existence of \n\nsuch torque contributes to the circular path of the magnetic moments around the applied \n\nfield direction in a motion referred to as Larmor precession (Jacobsen, 2007). The rate of \n\nthis precession depends on the magnetogyric ratio of the nucleus, which leads to the \n\nprecessing of different nuclei around the applied magnetic field at an angle with different \n\nangular velocities or Larmor frequencies (Figure 3.7). The rate of the precession can be \n\ndefined by the angular velocity,     (rads\n-1\n\n) (Equation 3.2), or frequency,   (Hz) (Equation \n\n3.3), expressed as: \n\n \n\n        (3.2) \n \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n (3.3) \n\n \n\nI = - \u00bd  \n\nI = + \u00bd  \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\nwhere   is the strength of the nuclear magnetic moment and    represents the strength of \n\nthe external magnetic field. Consequently, the frequency at which a proton precesses is \n\nproportional to the strength of the nuclear magnetic moment as well as to the strength of \n\nthe external magnetic field. The precession frequency increases with increase of the \n\nstrength of the external magnetic field (Pavia et al., 1996; Gil et al., 2002; Jacobsen, 2007; \n\nBakeev, 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7: Precession of a single proton around the external magnetic field. Reprinted with permission from Bakeev \n\n(2010). Copyright 2010 John Wiley and Sons. \n\n \n\nWhen the precession process occurs it is generated an oscillating electric filed with the \n\nsame frequency    . If radiofrequency waves of this frequency are required to the \n\nprecessing proton, the energy can be absorbed and the proton promoted to the less \n\nfavorable higher energy state. This energy transferred from the incoming radiation to the \n\nnucleus can only be performed when the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation \n\napplied matches the frequency generated by the precessing nucleus, the Larmor precession. \n\nWhen the two fields, the frequency of the applied radiation and of the precession, coincide \n\nor resonate and the energy can be transferred, the nucleus changes its spin state and \n\nconsequently the nuclear magnetic resonance process occurs (Figure 3.8) (Pavia et al., \n\n1996; Claridge, 1999). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n60 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8: The nuclear magnetic resonance process (Pavia et al., 1996). \n\n \n\nWhen considering a collection of similar spin-half nuclei in the applied magnetic field, it is \n\nverified that, in equilibrium, the distribution of spin population between the two possible \n\nenergy states, the parallel ( ) and the anti-parallel ( ) to the applied magnetic field, is not \n\nthe same. A slight excess of spin population in the parallel direction is found due to this \n\nlevel being energetically more favorable. The distribution of the spin population between \n\nthe two energy levels is defined by the Boltzmann distribution as given by Equation 3.4 \n\n(Claridge, 1999; Becker, 2000): \n\n \n\n  \n  \n\n     \n  \n\n  \n  (3.4) \n\n \n\nwith      representing the populations of nuclear spins in the parallel      and anti-\n\nparallel levels     ,   the Boltzman constant and   the absolute temperature. Since the \n\nenergy separation of the spins states is comparatively small and consequently the \n\ncorresponding population differences between both levels are also small, NMR is \n\nconsidered to be an insensitive technique relative to other techniques, such as IR and UV \n\n(Christian et al., 1986). However, the insensitivity of the NMR instrument can be \n\novercome with the increase of the operation frequency of the NMR instruments. Thus \n\ncontributing to a larger separation between the energy levels and consequently to higher \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\npopulation difference. These improvements were very important especially to observe less \n\nsensitive nuclei, such as \n13\n\nC, that is not very abundant, and to improve the signal-to-noise \n\nratio of the spectrum (Pavia et al., 1996). The small excess of nuclear spins in the parallel \n\nstate is measured in NMR and is responsible for the NMR signal. The excess of population \n\ndistributed randomly about the precessional cone and parallel to the Z-axis is summed \n\ntogether, after the opposing nuclear spins in the parallel and anti-parallel direction cancel \n\neach other out, in a bulk magnetization vector along the magnetic field M0 (see Figure 3.9).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9: Formation of the bulk magnetization vector from the excess spin population.

Copyright 2010 John Wiley and Sons. \n\n \n\nWhen the sample is irradiated by an orthogonal radiofrequency field, B1, all of the \n\nmagnetic nuclei in the molecule are simultaneously excited. Consequently, the spins, \n\noscillating at the Larmor frequency, start to precess around the orthogonal B1 field and, \n\nafter a few microseconds, the net magnetization vector M0 will rotate into the transverse \n\n(x-y) plane, where it can be electronically detected. This radiofrequency pulse is \n\ntransmitted through a coil surrounding the sample, whose geometry dictates that the B1 \n\nfield exists in the transverse plane, perpendicular to the static magnetic field B0 (Pavia et \n\nal., 1996; Claridge, 1999; Bakeev, 2010). The amplitude and the duration of the \n\nradiofrequency pulse are responsible for the angle through which the net magnetization \n\nvector M0 turns. Thus, the magnetization vector M0 reaches the y axis after a 90\u00ba pulse \n\n(Figure 3.10) and consequently, no magnetization vector will be observable along de z \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n62 \n \n\naxis. With this, after the application of the 90\u00ba pulse, the populations of the   and   states \n\nare equalized, since there is no magnetization along the z axis. However, the net \n\nmagnetization in the x-y plane results from the bunching of the individual spins, which are \n\nin a phase coherent manner, caused by the radiofrequency pulse applied. On the other \n\nhand, if the radiofrequency pulse is left on for twice as long, the magnetization vector M0 \n\nbecomes oriented along the -z axis, representing a 180\u00ba pulse. With the 180\u00ba pulse the \n\npopulations of the spin states are inverted and more spins are found in the   state than in \n\nthe   state, to place the bulk vector anti-parallel to the static field. When the magnetization \n\nvector M0 is oriented along the -z axis no signal is detected. Only magnetization vector in \n\nthe x-y plane is able to induce a signal in the detection coil (Claridge, 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10: Representation of the net magnetization vector M0 in the transverse plane after the application of the 90\u00ba \n\nradiofrequency pulse.

This return to equilibrium referred to as \n\nthe relaxation is responsible for the NMR signal to decay with time. The decaying signal is \n\ncalled as free induction decay (FID) and it is the basis for all NMR data (Claridge, 1999). \n\nThe Fourier transformation (FT) of the FID, of the time domain data, is used to separate \n\neach of the individual components of the decay signal and convert them to frequencies, \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\ngiving rise to a frequency domain spectrum (common NMR spectrum) as visualized in \n\nFigure 3.11 (Pavia et al., 1996). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11: Application of the Fourier transformation on the FID.

The longitudinal relaxation (recovery of magnetization along the z axis) \n\ncorresponds to the re-establishment of the equilibrium of populations and consequently to \n\nthe energy exchanges occurring between the spins and the surroundings (lattice). The \n\ntransverse relaxation (decay of magnetization in the x-y plane) involves energy transfer \n\nbetween the magnetized spins. These two relaxation process described are assumed to \n\nfollow an exponential behaviour, occurring simultaneously but as completely separate \n\nphenomenas. This means, any nonequilibrium longitudinal component will approach M0 \n\nexponentially with time T1 while any transverse component of the magnetization \n\nexperience an exponential decay with time T2 (Christian et al., 1986; Claridge, 1999; \n\nJacobsen, 2007). \n\nAfter obtaining the NMR spectra, there are some useful parameters that can be extracted in \n\norder to provide important information for molecular structure characterization. For \n\ninstance in the \n1\nH NMR spectra these parameters include: i) chemical shift ( , expressed in \n\npart per million, ppm); ii) spin-spin coupling pattern (multiplicity); iii) coupling constant \n\n( ); and iv) signal intensity. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n64 \n \n\nAny nucleus in a molecule has an electronic environment which depends on where the \n\nnucleus is in the molecule and what is attached to it. When the electrons, that surround the \n\nnuclei, are subject to a strong static magnetic field, the electrons are induced to circulate \n\naround the applied field. The circulation of the electrons is responsible for the production \n\nof its own magnetic field that acts in opposition to the applied field. Thus, the effective \n\nmagnetic field experienced by the nucleus results from the effect of the magnetic field and \n\nthe induced magnetic fields generated by the circulation of the surrounding electrons. \n\nThese induced magnetic fields from the electrons are responsible for shielding the nucleus \n\nfrom the applied magnetic field. Since, the shielding effect depends on the electron density \n\naround the nucleus, then the effective magnetic field that each individual nuclei experience \n\ndepends on the chemistry surrounding the nucleus under observation. Thus, in the case of \n\nproton observation, protons at different sites in the molecule are magnetically shielded to \n\ndifferent extents depending on their chemical environment and location (neighbouring \n\natoms and type of chemical bond). Consequently, each site experiences a different \n\nmagnetic field and has a different position on the NMR spectrum. The position of NMR \n\npeaks with each peak corresponding to a unique chemical environmental is measured by its \n\nresonance frequency (expressed in Hz) and it depends on the magnetic field strength and \n\non the operating frequency of the spectrometer. Consequently, the position of a NMR \n\nsignal vary from one spectrometer to another as the magnetic field strength changes. \n\nHowever, in order to allow consistent comparison of the NMR data, the obtained \n\nresonance frequencies are: i) normalized using a reference compound (set to 0.0 ppm); and \n\nii) divided by the resonance frequency of the spectrometer (in MHz). The resulting \n\ndimensionless quantity obtained is termed chemical shift     and expressed in parts per \n\nmillion (ppm). This chemical shift is independent of the operating frequency of the \n\nspectrometer (Bakeev, 2010). \n\nThe interaction that occurs between the neighbouring magnetic nuclei with a molecule is \n\ncommonly referred as spin-spin coupling or scalar coupling. This interaction is responsible \n\nfor the splitting of NMR signals into multiplets. The multiplicity of a signal, referred as the \n\nnumber of peaks in the split signal, is expressed as      , where   represents the \n\nnumber of neighbouring equivalent nuclei and   the spin quantum number. \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nFor \n1\nH NMR spectra, the peak area (integrated peak area or integral) of the signals is \n\ndirectly proportional to the number of equivalent nuclei represented by that peak \n\n(Jacobsen, 2007). In this context, for quantitative NMR acquisition conditions, it is \n\nimportant to allow the spins to fully relax between pulses in order that the observed signal \n\nintensities will not diminished by incomplete recovery of the magnetization between \n\nacquisitions. The pre-processing of the NMR spectra is also a fundamental requirement to \n\nenhance the quantification results. In the next chapter all the pre-processing steps used are \n\ndescribed. Besides the \n1\nH NMR spectra, the most commonly used for quantitative analysis \n\nof complex mixtures, quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR may also be used in an attempt to obtain \n\ncomplementary structural information. Moreover, the use of different nuclides (nitrogen, \n\nsulfur and oxygen) may be a good choice when the concentration of acidic OH and basic N \n\ngroups are desirable. It will be possible to identify some compounds as ethers, secondary \n\namines, thioethers and thiophenes (Snape, 1986). The identification of ethers is a way to \n\nidentify oxygen bonds that may have some impact in some processes, such as \n\ndesulfurization and denitrogenation. From all nucleus presented, \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC are the most \n\ncommonly used in the analysis of petroleum fractions. For this reason they were studied \n\nand applied in this work.  \n\n \n\n3.2.1. \n1\nH NMR Spectroscopy \n\nThe natural abundance of \n1\nH is 99%, one of the main reasons which allows a proton \n\nspectrum to be obtained in a few seconds. Generally the proton resonates over a range of \n\n15 ppm; using a reference compound such as tetramethylsilane (TMS) its chemical shift \n\ngoes from 0 ppm to 15 ppm. The chemical shift of 0 ppm is assigned to TMS. An example \n\nof a \n1\nH NMR spectrum for a fuel oil is presented in Figure 3.12. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n66 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12: \n1\nH NMR spectrum of a fuel oil. \n\n \n\nIn a \n1\nH NMR spectrum it is possible to identify different types of hydrogens. In a \n\npetroleum or even in a petroleum fraction these hydrogens can be differentiated in four \n\ndifferent groups: i) aromatic hydrogen \u2013 hydrogens attached to carbons on aromatic rings; \n\nii) hydrogens attached to carbons in the ? position on the aromatic rings     ; iii) \n\nhydrogens of methyl groups (CH3) located in the   position and beyond relative to the \n\naromatic rings     ; and iv) all other hydrogens \u2013 CH, CH2 of chains in the   position and \n\nbeyond, and the CH3 hydrogens in the   position      (Wauquier, 1995; Speight, 2002). \n\nThe percentage of hydrogen for each one of the above groups can easily be determined due \n\nto the fact that the signal\u2019s area are directly proportional to the number of protons and \n\nrelated to the percentage of atoms. This is one of the main advantages of \n1\nH NMR \n\ncompared with other spectral analysis methods. With the information that can be taken \n\nfrom the \n1\nH NMR spectrum it is possible to affirm that the \n\n1\nH NMR spectroscopy is a \n\ntechnique which contributes to obtain information about the structural characteristics and \n\nto estimate the aromaticity factor, molecular weight, average length of some chains and \n\nother important parameters. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\n3.2.2. \n13\n\nC NMR Spectroscopy \n\n13\nC resonates over about 220 ppm. The \n\n13\nC NMR is less sensitive than \n\n1\nH NMR due to the \n\nlower natural abundance (1.1%) and to the lower gyromagnetic ratio of the C-13 isotope. \n\nIn addition, the resonance of \n13\n\nC nuclei is the most difficult to observe and the carbon \n\nnuclei have a longer relaxation time comparing to the protons. Even using the Fourier \n\ntransform data acquisition, the acquisition of a \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum can be long and it can \n\ntake hours to be obtained (Pavia et al., 1996). This can be explained by the fact that \n13\n\nC \n\nnuclei relaxes slower than protons, making a very long relaxation delay between repetitive \n\npulses necessary. Moreover, the \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy is characterized for presenting a \n\nvery complex spectrum with high multiplicity of the signals. To eliminate these high \n\nmultiplicity that results from the spin-spin splitting due to the protons attached to each \n\ncarbon, the decoupling of the proton must be used. With the decoupling, where all the \n\nprotons in the molecule are irradiated with continuous low power radio frequency energy \n\nat the proton resonance frequency, the \n13\n\nC nucleus appears as a singlet independently of \n\nthe number of protons attached. This occurs since with the decoupling the \n13\n\nC nucleus only \n\nsees the average of each proton between the two energy levels. The final spectrum will be \n\ncomposed by a set of peaks, one for each carbon, indicating especially the number of \n\ncarbons in the sample (Morrison et al., 1996; Jacobsen, 2007). Figure 3.13 is an example \n\nof a decoupling \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum of a crude oil. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13: Inverse gate decoupling \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum of a crude oil (Albecore Crude Oil). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n68 \n \n\nThe \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum is produced basically by the same way that the \n1\nH NMR spectrum \n\nand the same basic principles are applied. The information given by the \n13\n\nC NMR spectra \n\nis generically similar as that of the \n1\nH NMR spectra. The \n\n13\nC NMR gives information \n\nrelated to: i) aromatic CH groups; ii) aromatic carbons substituted by an alkyl chain; and \n\niii) condensed aromatic carbons belonging to two attached rings (Wauquier, 1995). \n\nHowever, the normally used \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum is not quantitative, this is, the peak areas \n\nare not proportional to their concentration especially due to the relaxation phenomena \n\n(Christian et al., 1986). It is for this reason that \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy is preferred over the \n\n13\nC spectroscopy in the analysis of mixtures. Although it is possible to acquire a \n\nquantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum which, especially in the case of polymers and complex \n\nmixtures, it takes an extremely long time. To obtain a quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum, the \n\ndifferent relaxation times of \n13\n\nC nuclei in different chemical groups, especially for \n\naliphatic versus aromatic C, and the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) effect, must \n\nbe suppressed (Altgelt et al., 1994). The NOE effect is related to the increase degree in the \n\nsignal intensity, with a weak radio frequency signal, when C-H coupled protons are \n\nsaturated by the decoupling field. However, the increase peak intensity is not always the \n\nsame and due to such variability, the NOE must be avoided for quantitative measurements \n\n(Pavia et al., 1996). To reduce the long relaxation times of some carbons a paramagnetic \n\nrelaxation reagent, such as trisacetylacetonatochromim(III) [Cr(acac)3], is needed to be add \n\nto the sample. Using this reagent the long relaxation time of some carbons is reduced and \n\nthe relaxation mechanism is changed (Altgelt et al., 1994). Besides all this, the \n13\n\nC NMR \n\nspectroscopy is used to obtain information relatively to the molecular carbon skeleton and \n\nto the chemical composition of a sample, also considered as an important method for the \n\nstructure elucidation. \n\n \n\n3.2.3. NMR Spectrometer \n\nFigure 3.14 represents a schematic illustration of a high resolution NMR spectrometer. By \n\nanalysis of the Figure 3.14 it is possible to identify some indispensable parts that form the \n\nNMR spectrometer such as the magnet, the probe containing the sample, the radio \n\nfrequency transmitter to pulse and receive the emitted response, the preamplifiers and the \n\ncomputer to collect, digitize and perform the Fourier transform of the signals. \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14: An example of a modern NMR spectrometer. Adapted from Claridge (1999). \n\n \n\nThe superconducting magnet is one of the main reasons why NMR spectrometer is \n\nconsidered a complex and expensive equipment. To operate it requires to be in a bath of \n\nliquid helium, responsible for cooling the system down to 4 K, and surrounded by a bath of \n\nliquid nitrogen also responsible for cooling the instrument down to about 77 K avoiding \n\nhelium evaporation. There are different types of magnets such as the permanent magnet, an \n\nelectromagnet or a superconducting solenoid (\u201csupercon\u201d), but all of them are responsible \n\nfor the generation of a very strong, stable and homogeneous magnetic field. It is in the \n\ncentral bore of the magnet that many shim coils (or electrical coils) are housed. These shim \n\ncoils with a small magnetic field are responsible for the shimming, a process that \n\ncontributes for optimizing the magnetic field homogeneity. Inside the magnet, the probe \n\nalternately transmits and receives radio frequency signals. The probe which is like a coil of \n\nwire positioned around the sample receives higher power and very short pulse duration of \n\nradio frequency, emitted by a transmitter. After that and to obtain a digital FID signal, the \n\nelectrical analogue signal received is amplified, converted to a digital format and sampled \n\nat regular intervals of time by the computer via the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC).

Applications \n\nMany researches using NMR spectroscopy can be found in the literature, however, the vast \n\nmajority of these applications can be divided in different main headings: i) determination \n\nof structures of pure compounds; ii) quantitative determination of mixtures; iii) \n\ndetermination of diffusion coefficients and porosity; and iv) measurements of relaxation \n\ntimes. NMR spectroscopy combined with other major techniques is very useful for \n\nstructural determination, while NMR spectroscopy combined with multivariate statistical \n\nmethods is important for quantitative determinations. \n\nRelatively to the analysis of petroleum fractions, few applications have been described in \n\nthe literature. NMR has been already used in this field for a long time, being first published \n\nby Friedel (1959), \u201cAbsorption Spectra and Magnetic Resonance Spectra of Asphaltene\u201d. \n\nSince then, some researchers have been publishing the use of NMR in the analysis of \n\npetroleum fractions. The main purpose was to help refineries to refine heavy crude oils in \n\nmore efficient ways and at lower processing costs. Examples of the applications of \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy, \n\n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra of petroleum samples, asphaltenes \n\ncharacterization, NMR techniques and NMR relaxation effects are going to be presented. \n\nThe use of multivariate statistical methods of NMR spectra is going to be presented in \n\nanother chapter (see Chapter 5). \n\n \n\n3.3.1. \n1\nH NMR Spectroscopy in the Analysis of Petroleum Fractions \n\n1\nH NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the aromatic content of petroleum products \n\nsuch as base oils (Sarpal et al., 1998). Some methods have been developed for such \n\npurpose as the one presented by Brown and Ladner (Sarpal et al., 1998). However, since \n\nthese methods required the use of other techniques such as C and H elemental analysis and \n\nother parameters not directly estimated, new alternatives were required. The objective of \n\nmodifying the Brown-Ladner equation (represented by the Equation 3.5) was to quantify \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\nthe factors needed to determine the aromatic content, like the elemental H and C content of \n\nthe sample      , the average number of hydrogen per ?-alkyl substituents, the atomic \n\n \n   ratio for non-aromatic groups      in the sample, the aromatic protons     , among \n\nothers.  \n\n \n\n        \n         \n\n \n   \n\n  \n  (3.5) \n\n \n\nSarpal et al. (1998) developed a direct and quick method with the objective to create a new \n\nequation to estimate the aromatic content      of base oils using \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy. \n\nFrom the interpretation of the \n1\nH NMR spectra and the use of two-dimensional \n\nheteronuclear correlation (2D HETCOR) technique it was possible to calculate the \n\naromatic carbon content by changing the Brown-Ladner equation (Equation 3.5), as well as \n\nto estimate the bridgehead carbons      and the quaternary aromatic carbons      content. \n\nThe new equation (Equation 3.6) does not need the determination of such factors but just \n\nthe directly use of one and two dimensional NMR spectra to estimate the number of \n\nprotonated aromatic carbons      , the substituted aromatic carbons     , the contribution \n\nof bridgehead carbons      and the total relative number of carbons     . \n\n \n\n    \n         \n\n  \n      (3.6) \n\n \n\nThis method gives similar results as the Equation 3.5 being more advantageous due to the \n\npossibility to be used in all types of base oils as well as to the quick results which are \n\nobtained. \n\nSince the reduction of the aromatic content is one of the future objectives of the refineries \n\nit is important to quantify the total amount of aromatics in the petroleum fractions. Bansal \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n72 \n \n\net al. (1998) started to use \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy to estimate the content of total aromatics \n\nand their distribution as mono and polynuclear aromatics. These authors (Bansal et al., \n\n1998) started to analyse the \n1\nH NMR spectra and the 2D HETCOR (\n\n13\nC-\n\n1\nH) NMR spectra \n\nof a representative diesel sample and of the aromatic fraction of a diesel sample, \n\nrespectively. They estimated some structural parameters like the number of substituted \n\naromatic carbons    ; Equation 3.7), the average of alkyl chain length      of aromatic \n\nsubstituents (Equation 3.8), the number of bridgehead carbons    ; Equation 3.9), the total \n\naromatic content of the sample    ; Equation 3.10) and the estimation of mono-ring    ; \n\nEquation 3.11) and global di-plus-ring aromatics    ; Equation3.12): \n\n \n\n    \n \n\n \n   \n\n  \n \n  (3.7) \n\n \n\n   \n\n  \n        \n\n \n    \n\n        \n \n    \n\n        \n \n   \n\n \n        \n\n \n  \n\n (3.8) \n\n \n\n           (3.9) \n\n \n\n    \n  \n  \n      (3.10) \n\n \n\n         (3.11) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\n   \n        \n\n    \n (3.12) \n\n \n\nwith   representing the 2.4-3.5 ppm region;    the 2.0-2.4 ppm region;    the integral \n\nintensity of the   ppm region;    the integral intensity in the 7.5-10.0 ppm region;    the \n\nmolecular weight of the aromatics; and finally    the total group molecular weight. 2D \n\nHETCOR spectra were used to improve the analysis and the signals assignment in the \n1\nH \n\nNMR spectra, due to the overlapping. It allowed to conclude that only exist \u2013CH3 groups \n\nbetween 0.5-1.0 ppm and did not exist any overlap; while some ?-CH3 (?-substitution in \n\naromatic carbons) groups were found between 2.4-2.6 ppm. It was possible, as well, to find \n\na relationship between the \u2013CH2 carbons, 25-40 ppm, and the protons that exist in the 2.4-\n\n3.5 ppm region. With these data, it was concluded that some ?-CH2, ?-CH3 substituents on \n\nthe aromatics and also some ?-CH protons exist in the range 2.4-3.5 ppm. In the \n13\n\nC NMR \n\nspectra, the overlap achieved between the 18-20 ppm may be due to the methyl \n\nsubstituents of the aromatic rings. \n\nFrom the interpretation of the \n 1\n\nH NMR spectra of heavy crude oils developed by Behera et \n\nal. (2008), Bansal et al. (1998), and Ali et al .(2005) it is possible to assign a range of \n\nchemical shifts to different types of protons (Table 3.1). \n\n \n\nTable 3.1: Chemical shift regions of various types of protons (solvent: deuteriochloroform). \n\n Chemical shift range (ppm) Type of protons \n\nAromatic \n\nregion \n\n6.0-9.0 Total aromatic proton \n\n6.0-7.2 Mono-aromatic proton \n\n7.2-7.6 Di-aromatic molecules \n\n7.2-8.0 or > 8.0 Poly-aromatics molecules \n\nAliphatic \n\nregion \n\n2.05-4.5 H-? to aromatic ring \n\n1.1-2.05 H-? to aromatic ring in paraffinic CH and CH2 \n\n0.4-1.1 H-? to aromatic ring/terminal CH3 \n\n1.3 CH2 in long alkyl chains \n\n0.5-4.5 Total aliphatic proton \n\n0.9 CH3 in long alkyl chains \n\n2.1 CH2 in aromatic rings \n\n2.6 CH3 in aromatic rings \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n74 \n \n\n3.3.2. \n13\n\nC NMR Spectroscopy in the Analysis of Petroleum Fractions \n\nYoshida et al. (1980) developed a work on some characteristic compounds in the \n13\n\nC NMR \n\nspectra of the ring-type fractions of coal-derived oil aiming to determine the chemical shift \n\nranges of protonated, bridgehead and substituted carbons of this type of sample and with \n\nthat determine the equation for structural parameters. From the results of the Yoshida work \n\n(Yoshida et al., 1980) it was established that usually aromatic carbons appear in the order \n\nof protonated, bridgehead and substituted carbons from low to high frequency values. \n\nNormally, the chemical shifts of the protonated carbon appear at 115.0-129.2 ppm, the \n\nbridgehead carbons at 129.2-132.5 ppm, and the substituted carbons at 132.5-149.2 ppm. \n\nHowever, the presence of the phenolic OH and the amino groups influence the chemical \n\nshift of the neighbor protonated carbon shifting them to lower frequency values. Some of \n\nthe bridgehead carbons were extended to a field lower than 132.5 ppm and others \n\ncontinued to appear in the range of 129.2-132.5 ppm, depending if these carbons are \n\nnaphthalenic and methylated or just naphthenonaphthalenic, respectively. On the other \n\nhand, the chemical shift of the substituted carbons depends on the type of aliphatic carbons \n\nbonded to aromatic rings. In the subsequent \n13\n\nC NMR spectra analysis it was possible to \n\nassign some signals to chemical shifts of model compounds, for example, the signals at \n\n132.5-137.2 ppm were due to substituted aromatic carbons bonded to methyl groups or to \n\ncycloparaffinic ?-CH2. The signals at 137.2-149.2 ppm corresponded to the resonance of \n\nsubstituted aromatic carbons bonded to some alkyl groups (not include methyl and \n\nmethylene bridge between aromatic rings) and that at 149.2-158 ppm to aromatic carbon \n\nattached to OH groups (phenolic OH). Other important aspects established in the Yoshida \n\nwork (Yoshida et al., 1980) was that the coal-derived oil contain a lot of alkyl substituents \n\nand naphthenic rings. It was also possible to reach this conclusion through the analysis of \n\nsome structural parameters like the aromaticity    ; Equation 3.13), the ratio of non-\n\nbridgehead aromatic carbon to total carbon        ; Equation 3.14), and the degree of \n\naromatic ring substitution   ; Equation 3.15). These structural parameters were defined by \n\nthe following equations: \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n (3.13) \n\n \n\n   \n\n  \n \n     \n  \n\n (3.14) \n\n \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n    (3.15) \n\n \n\nwith    indicating the amount of the aromatic carbon,    the amount of total carbon,    \n\nthe amount of the bridgehead carbon, and    the amount of substituted carbon.  \n\nCookson and Smith (1985) studied a total of nine diesel samples, six of which were \n\npetroleum and three of them were synfuels (fuels from nonpetroleum sources), with two \n\nkerosene samples, aiming to obtain a better understanding on the differences in the \n\ncomposition, structural characteristics, and in the properties of each fuel using the \n13\n\nC \n\nNMR spectroscopy. They have used the gated spin echo technique (GASPE) with the \n\nobjective to minimize the overlap of resonances due to C, CH, CH2 and CH3 groups that \n\nusually occurred in a \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum of complex mixtures. From the analysis of the \n\nresonances appearing in the spectra, they could identify a possible structure corresponding \n\nto an n-alkane formalized as ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\ny\n\nCHCHCHCHCH\n222222223\n\n????? , and therefore \n\ncalculate some parameters as the    (average n-alkane chain length; Equation 3.16),    \n\n(average number of branching sites per molecule; Equation 3.17),    (average number of \n\nbranches per molecule; Equation 3.18) and    (average number of rings per molecule; \n\nEquation 3.19). It was also demonstrated that all the diesel samples have an average chain \n\nlength of 15-16 carbons while the kerosene examined has about 12 carbons chain length. \n\nHowever, firstly it is necessary to estimate the average number of carbons per molecule \n\n     that depends on the sample used.    is not always equal to the average n-alkane \n\nchain length     , once n-alkanes, branched saturated and cyclic saturated structures may \n\nhave different average number of carbon atoms. Besides   , it is also required to \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n76 \n \n\ndetermine the total \n13\n\nC NMR intensity due to the     and     groups and to known the C, \n\nCH and CH3 fractions of carbon atoms present as  ,    and     groups, respectively:  \n\n \n\n   \n                 \n\n      \n (3.16) \n\n \n\n            (3.17) \n\n \n\n             (3.18) \n\n \n\n                      (3.19) \n\n \n\nThe same authors, Cookson and Smith (1990), compared 50 jet and diesel fuels using \n13\n\nC \n\nNMR spectroscopy, to understand some fuel properties and to define its composition (like \n\naromaticity information as well as n-alkane abundance). The main objective of this \n\nanalysis was to provide better information about the composition of this type of samples \n\nneeded for the preparation of better quality refining products. Using earlier published \n\nworks (Cookson et al., 1985; Cookson et al., 1987), Cookson and Smith (1990) developed \n\na new approach (Equation 3.20) that listed a fraction relation of the total \n13\n\nC NMR spectral \n\nintensity due to a long-chain n-alkyl carbon      atoms with the fraction of the total \n13\n\nC \n\nNMR spectral intensity due to aromatic carbon      atoms, such as the following one: \n\n \n\n              (3.20) \n\n \n\nIn Equation 3.20,   ,    and   were determined by a multiple linear regression and   was \n\nthe property value. Cookson and Smith (1990) only considered the \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nto determine the samples composition, since it was considered a good technique to provide \n\naromatic carbons identification. They had also proven that this approach was more \n\nefficient than other complex equations, better to distinguish a large quantity of fuels from \n\ndifferent sources and available to determine their properties. \n\nSarpal et al. (1997) began to develop some experiments with some base oils aiming to \n\nestimate the content of some structural parameters, like the n-paraffin      and isoparaffin \n\n     contents, the number of branching sites      and the average alkyl chain length     . \n\nThese base oils, produced from different treatments like hydrocracking and wax \n\nisomerisation, were hydrofinished-solvent-refined oils (HF) of high viscosity index (HVI), \n\nseveral hydrofinished (SHF) oils of very high viscosity index (VHVI) and hydrotreated \n\nbase oils (HT). It was verified that although the similarity between the types of branched \n\nstructures produced by the hydrocracking and wax isomerisation, there were some \n\ndifferences, especially in the obtained quantities. For example, the HT base oils presented \n\nmore branched structures bearing methyl groups located at the fifth (or higher) carbon \n\naway from the end of the chain, but it did not have the contribution of some branched \n\nstructures, like the S-8, and had a greater amount of S-3, S-4 and S-5 structures (Table 3.2, \n\npage 80). The HF and the SHF have more S-8 type branched structures and reduced \n\namounts of S-3, S-4 and S-5 (Table 3.2). From the analysis of the \n13\n\nC NMR spectra, Sarpal \n\net al. (1997) could estimate the percentage of n-paraffin (Equation 3.21) and isoparaffin \n\n(Equation 3.22) contents by using the following expressions: \n\n \n\n        \n                 \n\n  \n  (3.21) \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n     \n                \n\n (3.22) \n\n \n\nwhere,    represents the total integral intensity in the region 5-160 ppm and    the integral \n\narea at the indicated   ppm. Sarpal et al. (1997) concluded that the HT and SHF base oils \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n78 \n \n\npresented an IP of 45-60%, whereas the HF base oils presented a smaller amount of \n\nisoparaffins (30-40%). As it was intended, other structural parameters were also calculated \n\nsuch as the    (Equation 3.23),    (Equation 3.24),      (percentage of terminal \n\nmethyl; Equation 3.25) and the      (percentage of branched methyl; Equation 3.26). \n\nHowever, to determine such parameters, the integral area at the indicated ppm      and the \n\npercentage of branched paraffinic carbons      were required. \n\n \n\n     \n  \n\n    \n  (3.23) \n\n \n\n   \n       \n\n  \n (3.24) \n\n \n\n          \n          \n\n  \n  (3.25) \n\n \n\n          \n                \n\n  \n  (3.26) \n\n \n\nFrom these results it was possible to conclude that the HT and SHF base oils have a less \n\naverage number of branching sites      (3.0-3.5) compared with the HF base oil (3.5-5.5). \n\nIt was also found that the HT base oils presented more branched paraffinic structures than \n\nbranching near terminal methyl groups (S-2, S-3 and S-4) compared with other oils (Table \n\n3.2). It also had more predominance of S-6 and S-7 and less quantity of S-8 structures \n\n(Table 3.2). These last structures were found in a higher percentage in the HF and SHF \n\noils. HT oils presented high quantity of branched structures, high quantity of isoparaffins, \n\nlow quantity of BS, a lower pour point and a higher viscosity index. These results allowed \n\nto conclude that oils having structures with higher quantity of branching near the end of the \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n79 \n\n \n\nchain present a lower pour point. It was also concluded that the high viscosity index (HVI) \n\nand very high viscosity index (VHVI) base oils presented a higher quantity of branched \n\nstructures near (S-2, S-3) and far (S-6, S-7) from the terminal carbon (Table 3.2). The \n\nVHVI oils had high quantity of NP and more S-6 and S-7 structures (Table 3.2) that \n\ncontribute to the higher viscosity index. The LVI base oils presented a higher number of \n\nbranching sites, a higher pour point and a lower viscosity index. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n80 \n \n\nTable 3.2: Some branched structures identified in base oils and their characteristic \n13\n\nC NMR chemical shifts.

(2009) used the \n13\n\nC NMR data of a broad variety of samples \n\nproduced from different vacuum gas oils to analyse the molecules with high viscosity \n\nindexes (VI). They concluded that oils presenting molecules with long alkyl chains, low \n\naromatic contents, ethyl branching and tertiary carbons presented high VI. Theoretically, \n\nthe VI has been considered an important way to predict the influence of the temperature on \n\nthe viscosity, since the viscosity of oils with a high VI are slightly influenced by \n\ntemperature. However, these authors (Verdier et al., 2009) also indicate that it is not \n\nalways correct to correlate the viscosity index with the influence of the temperature on the \n\noils viscosity, being also important to analyse the effect of the activation energy. They had \n\nalso announced that it is preferred to use the flow activation energy rather than the \n\nviscosity index to analyse the influence of the temperature on the oils viscosity. \n\nBased on the results obtained by Yoshida et al. (1980) and Behera et al. (2008) it was \n\npossible to assign a range of chemical shifts to resonances of different carbon signals in the \n\n13\nC NMR spectra of crude oils as are shown in Table 3.3. \n\n \n\nTable 3.3: Assignment of \n13\n\nC NMR chemical shifts to different types of carbon atoms (solvent: deuteriochloroform) \n\n(Yoshida et al., 1980; Behera et al., 2008). \n\nChemical shift \n\nrange (ppm) \nType of carbon atoms \n\n202.0-220.0 Ketone carbonyl carbon \n182.0-170.0 Acid carboxyl carbon \n165.0-175.0 Ester or amide carboxyl carbon \n100.0-160.0 Total aromatic carbon \n149.2-158.0 Aromatic carbons attached to heteroatoms \n137.2-149.2 Substituted carbons bonded to some alkyl groups (not include methyl and \n\nmethylene bridge between aromatic rings) \n132.5-137.2 Substituted carbons bonded to methyl group or to cycloparaffinic ?-CH2 \n129.2-132.5 Bridgehead aromatic carbons \n115.0-129.2 Protonated aromatic carbon \n128.5-160.0 Quaternary aromatic carbons without triple-bridged aromatic carbons \n100.0-128.5 Tertiary aromatic and triple-bridged aromatic carbons \n50.0-10.0 Total aliphatic carbon \n25.0-60.0 Naphthenic carbon \n29.1-31.5 Carbons in alkyl chains (n > 6) \n27.6-28.6 Carbons in branching position of a terminal iso-propyl group \n17.6-20.4 Carbons in CH3 branches \n13.7-15.5 Carbons in terminal position of n-alkyl chains (n > 6) \n0.0-20.5 Total carbon in CH3 groups \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n82 \n \n\n3.3.3. \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR Spectroscopy in the Analysis of Petroleum Samples \n\nWoods et al. (2008) used NMR spectroscopy to characterize the SARA fractions \n\n(saturated, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes) separated from different Canadian crude oils. \n\nThe assignment of different types of proton and carbon atoms in the \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR \n\nspectra (Figure 3.15) of SARA fractions led the authors (Woods et al., 2008) to conclude \n\nthat the aromaticity region (110-150 ppm) increases from saturated to asphaltenes \n\nfractions. This was confirmed by the     ratio decreasing with the increasing of \n\naromaticity. On the other hand, the saturated fraction was characterized by an aliphatic \n\nnature represented with a high     ratio. It was also concluded that the     ratio \n\ndecreases from saturated > aromatics > resins > asphaltenes; becoming the asphaltenes rich \n\nin long chain aliphatic compounds as can see in Figure 3.15. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15: Typical \n13\n\nC and \n1\nH NMR spectra for SARA fractions, obtained in a Varian Unity Inova 400 MHZ \n\nspectrometer with a 5 mm 4 nucleus probe.

With the \n\nobtained results the authors (Cookson et al., 1987) could then concluded that all analysed \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n84 \n \n\ndiesel fuels had an average of 13-15 carbons atoms per molecule whereas the kerosene \n\naromatics had a lower value (11-12 carbons atoms). Other similarities between all the \n\nseven diesel fractions were seen, such as the same number of side chains per molecule \n\n      , the same average side chain length          (in only six of the samples) and \n\nthe absence of quaternary carbon branching sites. One of the main differences between the \n\nsamples was related to the number of ring structures involving aliphatic carbon atoms. The \n\nnumber of rings      observed for a specific fraction depends of the original sample; when \n\na fraction is a product of hydrotreatment it has a large quantity of saturated ring structures. \n\nKerosene samples compared with the diesel fractions presented a lower number of \n\nsaturated rings per molecule and lower number of carbon atoms per molecule     . This \n\ncould be due to the lower number of side chains and to the lower side chain length. From \n\nthe \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra it was also possible to determine the average number of \n\nspecific CH3 groups (?-CH3 and ?-CH3) per molecule. The assignment of proton \n\nresonances indicated that normally the intensity near 2.25 ppm region was due to ?-CH3, \n\nwhile for some samples that signal could be at 2.1-2.4 ppm. The intensity of these signals \n\ngenerally yields 0.1 or 0.14 ?-CH3 groups per molecule, depending on the spectra and on \n\nthe occurring overlapping. In the \n1\nH NMR spectra, the signal at around 1 ppm was \n\nassumed to be due to the ?-CH3 groups. In this work (Cookson et al., 1987) it was also \n\npossible to identify some sub-structures, like methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl groups, \n\ntetralin, indane and 1-methylindane ring side chains in the analysed samples of shale oil \n\ndiesel. \n\nUnlike the work of Cookson and Smith (1987) and Bansal et al. (1998), Lee and \n\nGlavincevski (1999) decided to analyse the content of aromatics in middle distillate oils \n\nand have developed a NMR method for the determination of the molar content of \n\naromatics. A new expression (Equation 3.34): \n\n \n\n    \n \n\n \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n            (3.34) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n85 \n\n \n\nwas developed to estimate the molar content of aromatic groups by using the aromatic ?-\n\nhydrogen to ?-carbon atom ratio       , the number of ?-hydrogen     , the number of \n\naromatic ring carbons      and the number of aromatic ring hydrogens     . However, \n\nthese authors (Lee et al., 1999) have concluded that the presence of olefinic protons should \n\nbe taken into account, therefore the following equation was used in the aromaticity \n\ncalculation: \n\n \n\n                 \n   \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n (3.35) \n\n \n\nwhere o\nn\n\nfH  is the molar fraction of olefinic protons,        the total hydrogen to carbon \n\natom ratio, the        the hydrogen to carbon atom ratio of the olefinic bond structure and \n\n   the fraction of aromatic carbon (aromaticity). \n\nSergeant et al. (1995) used \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy to analyse different products \n\nfrom shale deposits in Australia in order to obtain information about the diversity of \n\nstructures composition of lubricating oils, of maltenes and of distillates. From the \n\ndifferences between these products, it is noteworthy that lubricating oils were characterized \n\nby the absence of olefinic structures, the Rundle distillate samples by the presence of \n\nmonoaromatic with some polyaromatic and naphthenic structures, while the maltenes \n\nwhere characterized by the existences of some olefinic structures and aliphatic chains that \n\nwere less substituted. \n\nRecently, de Andrade et al. (2010) presented a review with 62 references on the \n\ndetermination of conjugated dienes in petroleum products using different chemical and \n\ninstrumental techniques, including NMR spectroscopy. Among the implementation of \n\ndifferent techniques analysis, the authors indicated NMR spectroscopy as one of the \n\ntechniques chosen to characterize naphtha or gasoline samples and to characterize \n\nconjugated dienes in the samples. NMR was considered one of the techniques which \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n86 \n \n\ncontributed to obtain rapid answers and information about the conjugated dienes \n\ncomposition. \n\n \n\n3.3.4. NMR Spectroscopy in Asphaltenes Characterization \n\nAsphaltenes present a dark colour and are defined as the fraction from crude oil that is \n\nsoluble in toluene and insoluble in heptane. They are known to be the most complicated \n\ncompounds in crude oil and are very difficult to analyse due to their tendency to associate, \n\nto the high molecular weight (approximately 1000 g.mol\n-1\n\n) (Aske et al., 2002) and to the \n\nparamagnetism (Simanzhenkov et al., 2003). Due to their complex nature it has not been \n\nfound a specific molecular structure or a specific family compounds of asphaltenes \n\n(University of Illinois at Chicago, 2001), however there are different ideas relatively to \n\ntheir composition. Asphaltenes are characterized to be complex mixtures containing high \n\nquantity of heteroatoms (like nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and metals such as vanadium, nickel \n\nor iron) and condensed aromatic rings, aliphatic chains and naphthenic rings (see Table 2.1 \n\n\u2013 Chapter 2 in page 12 and 13). \n\nThe objective of several research groups is to gain more information about asphaltenes and \n\nto further understand their influence in thermal and catalytic processes. \n\nCalemma et al. (1995) compared the content of asphaltenes present in heavy crude oils of \n\nseven different sources and reported structural characterization of asphaltenes using NMR \n\nand other spectroscopic techniques. NMR techniques (\n13\n\nC NMR GASPE) allowed the \n\nidentification of some CH groups in the aliphatic chains, some condensed alicyclic \n\nstructures, especially in the more aliphatic asphaltene molecules, and the aliphatic CH3/CH \n\nratio. Furthermore it was possible to characterize the maturity of asphaltenes that is related \n\nto their capability to aggregate through ?-? aromatic interactions. With the analysis of \n\nsome molecular parameters from the NMR spectra, like the aromatic carbon fraction     , \n\nan average number of carbon per alkyl side chain      and the percentage substitution of \n\naromatic rings      it was possible to draw some conclusions. Almost all analysed \n\nasphaltenes presented comparable average aromatic condensations and average numbers of \n\npolycondensed aromatic rings in the range of 5-7. It was possible to observe that \n\nasphaltenes presented different behaviours with the increase in the carbon content. As \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n87 \n\n \n\nconsequence, when the carbon content of the asphaltene samples increases, the aromaticity \n\nand the average aromatic core size increase, the average length of alkyl side chains \n\ndecrease and the heteroatom content and the average molecular weights also decrease. \n\nAsphaltenes with smaller molecular weight presented more aromatic carbons, less \n\nheteroatoms, slightly sulfur content, and smaller aliphatic side chains. \n\nIn the same path, Sheremata et al. (2004) described a quantitative molecular representation \n\nof Athabasca asphaltenes, where \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy was used to provide data \n\nfrom elemental analysis. The authors have pointed out that the combination of \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC \n\nNMR spectroscopy were very useful in the analysis of asphaltene chemistry and for an \n\nadditional and better chemical detailed molecular structure description of these \n\ncompounds. This study provided more information about aromatic and aliphatic primary \n\nstructures, the concentration of quaternary and protonated aromatic carbons, the naphthenic \n\ncontent and the concentration of aliphatic CH and ?-CH3 groups. Finally, three possible \n\nstructures of asphaltenes, with multiple bridges between aromatic group were represented \n\n(Figure 3.16). However it was stated that these structures, as well as those denominated \n\nasphaltenes as archipelago structures, were not rigid, and some changes can occur \n\ndepending on the solvent environment. It is possible to occur interactions between the \n\nporous surface of asphaltenes and the surrounding solvent which has the capacity to entrain \n\nin the reticulated asphaltenes microstructure and change its geometry. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16: Example of some asphaltene structures generated using Monte Carlo method (Sheremata et al., 2004). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n88 \n \n\nDouda et al. (2008) analysed some asphaltene mixtures by comparing the asphaltenes \n\nfractions obtained after pyrolysis (at different temperatures) with the original ones, by \n\nusing \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy. The large bands of aromatic and saturated regions in \n\nthe \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra were thought to be due to the high values of different \n\nstructures of asphaltene compounds. From the obtained results it was concluded that \n\npyrolysis processes at high temperatures were responsible for a higher formation of \n\nasphaltenes. This knowledge about the effect of the temperature in the asphaltenes \n\nmodification is very important in the prevention of some problems during the crude oil \n\nrefining, like the deposition of asphaltenes in cooking, cracking and in the distillation.  \n\nDurand et al. (2008) presented for the first time a \n1\nH DOSY NMR spectrum of asphaltenes \n\n(Figure 3.17), from which it was possible to conclude that asphaltenes have more aliphatic \n\nthan aromatic structures. Although in this spectrum no aromatic protons were detected due \n\nto the influence of the toluene signals that have a high signal-to-noise ratio compared to the \n\nsample aromatic protons. However, a separation in the aromatic region exists and there are \n\nsome aromatic protons, although these aromatic rings are very substituted by alkyl chains. \n\nFurthermore, it was calculated the diffusion coefficient of asphaltenes and toluene using \n\nthe modified Stokes-Einstein equation and then compared them with the sample \n\nconcentration. The intention was to analyse the intermolecular interactions between solvent \n\nand solute and their dependence with the solute concentration and also to analyse the \n\nbehaviour of the diffusion coefficients, while increasing the sample concentration, which \n\ncan give some information about the nature of the mixture constituents. The separation in \n\nthe diffusion coefficient between residual heptane and asphaltenes was demonstrated \n\n(Figure 3.17), and it was concluded that the diffusion coefficient remains constant at low \n\nconcentrations, probably due to the predominance of the solute-solvent interactions. From \n\nthe signals in the spectrum (Figure 3.18) it was concluded that terminal CH3 groups of long \n\nalkyl chains were represented by signals at 0.9 ppm while at 1-2 ppm some CH2 groups \n\nwere found and peaks at 2.1-3 ppm correspond to CH, CH2 and CH3 in polycyclic aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons. It was also calculated the average molecular weight of asphaltenes (M ? \n\n3450 g.mol\n-1\n\n), being this result higher than expected when comparing with the published \n\nvalue (approximately 1000 g.mol\n-1\n\n) (Aske et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n89 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.17: Example of a \n1\nH DOSY NMR spectrum of a base oil.

Spectral editing NMR Techniques \n\nSince crude oil is a complex mixture of compounds it is important to use different \n\ntechniques to improve the quality of the NMR spectrum and to obtain better quantitative \n\ninformation about the sample in analysis. For this, beyond the use of 1D NMR \n\nspectroscopy, the typical \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra, it is beneficial to use the \u201cspectral \n\nediting\u201d techniques and the 2D NMR experiments (see Table 3.4, page 96 and 97). \n\nAlthough, the advantages of the \u201cspectral editing\u201d techniques and the 2D NMR \n\nexperiments were known, they were not applied during this work. The motivation for not \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n90 \n \n\napplying these techniques were related with the type of NMR spectrometer available for \n\nonline analysis, since the idea was evaluating the possibility of using an online NMR \n\nspectrometer to process stream monitoring. Moreover, the experimental time required to \n\nobtain the final spectra when using these techniques was much larger than when using 1D \n\n1\nH NMR spectroscopy, were the spectra data obtained could be recorded in only a few \n\nminutes. The time required to obtain the required information was very important to \n\nimprove the NMR potential for routine application in industry. However, in the literature, \n\ndepending on the object of research, there are many works where 1D and 2D NMR spectra \n\nare used in combination, not referring only to studies about heavy crude oil but in other \n\ndifferent areas such as the Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, in mixture analysis of \n\nnatural products (Exarchou et al., 2000; Lewis et al., 2007; Kontogianni et al., 2009) \n\nwhere the use of 2D NMR spectroscopy has demonstrated great potentialities in structural \n\nelucidation and quantification of complex mixtures.  \n\nThe \u201cspectral editing\u201d (Altgelt et al., 1994) techniques can be used to improve the analysis \n\nof the \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra due to the overlapping of signals, previously mentioned, \n\nwhich make difficult the identification of some structures. The aim of these \u201cspectral \n\nediting\u201d techniques is to contribute to the separation of primary (CH3), secondary (CH2), \n\ntertiary (CH) and quaternary      carbons and to a sensitivity improvement. Examples of \n\n\u201cspectral editing\u201d techniques are the INEPT (insensitive enhancement by polarization \n\ntransfer), DEPT (distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer), GASPE (gated spin \n\necho), PCSE (part-coupled spin echo) and QUAT (quaternary\u2013only carbon spectra). \n\nINEPT and DEPT are examples of methods known as polarization transfer methods. The \n\naim of these methods is to transfer the large excess of population (polarization) of the \n1\nH to \n\nthe insensitive nuclei before its perturbation (in the present case to \n13\n\nC nuclei). On the \n\nother hand, the 2D NMR spectrum depend on the coupling between two nuclei. It is \n\npossible to have a 2D homonuclear spectrum that results from the coupling between nuclei \n\nfrom the same type and the 2D heteronuclear spectrum between nuclei from a different \n\ntype. 2D COSY is an example of a homonuclear spectrum (Figure 3.19). In this spectrum it \n\nis correlated one proton to another proton, depending on the coupling constant value, \n\nwhich leads to identify resonances that are coupled each other. Cookson and Smith (1987), \n\nSarpal et al. (1996), and Behera et al. (2008) are example of works, presented below, \n\nwhere this technique was used in the analysis of crude oils. \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n91 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.19: Example of a COSY spectrum of a base oil.

In this case, it is established a correlation between all the spins in a set of \n\ncoupled spins in a molecule. Doan et al. (1995) has used this technique in the analysis of \n\npolyaromatics in crude gas oil mixtures. \n\nHETCOR is a 2D heteronuclear spectrum (see Figure 3.20) where it is possible to obtain a \n\ncorrelation between coupled heteronuclear spins across a single bond. Cookson and Smith \n\n(1987), Sarpal et al. (1996) and Behera et al.

In these \n\ntechniques the \n1\nH magnetization is directly detected while the \n\n13\nC magnetization is \n\nindirectly detected. For this reason, the \n13\n\nC magnetization is known as the \u201cinverse\u201d \n\nexperiment. While the HETCOR, known as a heteronuclear experiment, is the \u201cnormal\u201d \n\none, because in this case, the \n1\nH magnetizations are indirectly detected and the \n\n13\nC directly \n\ndetected. The \u201cinverse\u201d experiments are preferable over HETCOR, since the latter has \n\nlower sensitivity due to the detection of the lower-y nuclide, typically \n13\n\nC. In addition, the \n\n\u201cinverse\u201d experiments are proton detected as the proton are much more sensitive nucleus \n\ncompared with the \n13\n\nC (Claridge, 1999). HSQC correlates coupled heteronuclear spins \n\nacross a single bond while HMBC correlates coupled spins across multiple bonds.

The obtained 2D spectrum is characterized for presenting, in one \n\ndirection, the signals dispersed according to chemical shift while in the other the signals \n\nare dispersed taking into account the diffusion constant. Since this technique measures the \n\nself-diffusion coefficients it contributes to obtain information on structural, molecular size, \n\nshape, aggregation states and composition of complex mixtures. One of the great \n\nadvantages of this technique is that it doesn\u2019t need a prior separation of individual \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n94 \n \n\ncomponents to separate, assignee and identify the different signals of a crowded spectrum \n\n(Claridge, 1999; Kapur et al., 2000; Durand et al., 2008). \n\nCookson and Smith (1987) used homonuclear 2D COSY spectra, coupled and decoupled \n\n2D HETCOR spectra, and a RELAY 2D NMR method to provide a better analysis of the \n\n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra and thus making a better structural assignment. \n\nSarpal et al. (1996) used GASPE, PCSE, INEPT, DEPT, QUAT, 2D COSY and HETCOR \n\nto classify the composition of some different base oils in terms of the hydrocarbon types, \n\nespecially the isoparaffins. 2D COSY and HETCOR helped to specifically improve the \n\nidentification of some branching structures, since these spectra allows clarifying the \n\nexisting information inside the overlapping signals. The use of DEPT also contributed to \n\nthe improvement of the signals overlapping, especially in the region 28-40 ppm, as well as \n\ncontributing to the separation of some carbons of normal paraffins, but did not give any \n\nidea about the existence of quaternary carbons, which could be due to the size of these \n\nstructures. The use of 2D COSY and HETCOR contributed to the improvement in the \n\nidentification and quantification of some types of branched structures (about eleven types \n\nof different branched structures). \n\nBesides the techniques used by Sarpal et al. (1996), it was already demonstrated that other \n\ntechniques could contributed to the separation, assignment and identification of various \n\nsignals in a crowded spectrum. Kapur et al. (2000) showed that the 2D DOSY NMR \n\nspectroscopy is very useful in the interpretation of the \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra of such \n\ncomplex mixtures such as crude oil, which are characterized by a great signals overlapping \n\nmaking difficult the identification of some components. In the \n1\nH NMR spectra the \n\noverlapping occurs in the 0.5-2.0 ppm range due to the saturated components, whereas in \n\nthe \n13\n\nC NMR the overlapping was stronger in the 10-45 ppm range. Using the DOSY \n\nspectra the characteristic overlapping of both \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra was reduced \n\nallowing a better resolution of the signals and a better structure elucidation. This technique \n\ndemonstrated to be very helpful in the analysis of heavy petroleum fractions. \n\nAfter Kapur et al. (2000) used a DOSY technique in the analysis of an aromatic petroleum \n\nfraction, in the distillate boiling range, Durant et al. (2008) presented a DOSY spectrum of \n\na diesel sample and for the first time a \n1\nH DOSY spectrum of asphaltenes. These authors \n\n\n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\n(Durand et al., 2008) confirmed that DOSY NMR technique is very important in the \n\nanalysis of complex samples, such as crude oil, that could provided information on size, \n\nmolecular weight, aggregation state and the composition of the mixture. The main \n\nadvantage of this technique is the potential to give physical-chemical information all at \n\nonce when compared to the pulse field gradient spin-echo NMR diffusion sequences \n\n(PFGSE NMR). \n\nMore recently, Behera et al. (2008) used some NMR techniques, such as the gated-\n\ndecoupled \n13\n\nC, DEPT, 2D (\n1\nH-\n\n13\nC) HETCOR and other 2D NMR methods for better \n\nidentification of some structures in the very crowded NMR spectra of heavy petroleum \n\nfractions. For example, these authors (Behera et al., 2008) showed that HSQC and HMBC \n\nspectra were proven to be better techniques in the identification of side chain structures of \n\naromatics.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.4: Spectral editing NMR techniques. \n\n \n\n \n\nAdvantages/Drawbacks \n\nGASPE Gated Spin Echo \nInformation about carbon type distribution, distinguishing and isolating C, CH, CH2 and CH3 sub-\n\nspectra. \n\nPCSE \nPart-Coupled Spin \n\nEcho \n\nInformation about carbon type distribution, distinguishing and isolating C, CH, CH2 and CH3 sub-\n\nspectra (practically identical to GASPE). \n\nDEPT \n\nDistortionless \n\nEnhancement by \n\nPolarization Transfer \n\nBetter than GASPE and PCSE due to a precise and quick analysis of the CH and CH3 sub-spectra. \n\nQuantifies CH, CH2 and CH3 carbons but not quaternary carbons. \n\nQUAT \nQuaternary\u2013only \n\nCarbon Spectra \nUsed to determine quaternary carbons. \n\nDOSY \nDiffusion-Ordered \n\nSpectroscopy \n\nOne of the most commonly employed methods for identifying compounds in complex mixtures of \n\npetroleum fractions depending on different diffusion coefficients.

This \n\ntechnique identifies the heteroatoms to which the protons are \n\ndirectly attached and can be used to detect carbon nuclei indirectly \n\nfrom more sensitive protons, to assign side chain structures to \n\naromatics (G\u00fcnther, 1995) and to locate the position of a \n\nfunctional group within a known carbon skeleton (Jacobsen, \n\n2007). \n\nThe combination of HSQC and \n\nHMBC is, today, a powerful \n\nmethod used in tracing the \n\ncarbon skeleton of a compound \n\n(Jacobsen, 2007). \n\nHMBC \n\nHeteronuclear \n\nMultiple Quantum \n\nCorrelation \n\nTechnique also called an \u201cinverse\u201d experiment. This type of \n\ntechnique known as a long range heteronuclear correlation over \n\ntypically two or three bonds, can be used to obtain information \n\nabout the location of carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatoms bonds. \n\nIt is also used to detect indirectly quaternary and protonated \n\ncarbons coupled to protons and provide unique information about \n\nthe skeleton of a molecule (Claridge, 1999; Jacobsen, 2007). \n\nPFGSE \nPulse Field Gradient \n\nSpin-Echo \n\nCharacterized by introducing a perturbation in the magnetic field that propagates to the nearby \n\nprotons.

This technique allows the measurement of asphaltenes diffusion coefficients. \n\nRELAY \nHeteronuclear Relayed \n\nCoherence Transfer \n\nGives information about coupled Hn-Hm groups and correlates \n13\n\nC resonances associated with the \n\nCHn and CHm groups (Cookson et al., 1987). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n \n\n98 \n \n\n3.3.6. NMR Relaxation Effects \n\nThe spin nuclear relaxation process is a very important way to obtain information about \n\nstereochemistry and molecular dynamics. This nuclear relaxation phenomenon is related \n\nwith the structure, flexibility and molecular mobility that is responsible for the existent of \n\ndifferent magnetic fields. The relaxation rate can be determined experimentally using the \n\nrelationship between the relaxation times, T1 and T2, and the correlation time for molecular \n\ntumbling. The NMR techniques based on the analysis of T1 (longitudinal or spin-lattice \n\nrelaxation time) and T2 (transverse relaxation time) decay curves can be obtained using the \n\nlow-field \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy and correlated and supplemented with information taken \n\nwith the high-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. \n\nThe relaxation times are important tools in the comprehension of the molecular structure. \n\nFor example, when comparing two molecules if the relaxation time decreases it can be due \n\nto the existence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that decrease the mobility. The low field \n\n1\nH NMR relaxation method has been used for a long time especially in petrophysical \n\nanalysis and well logging in petroleum exploration (Yao et al., 2010). Since 1990s, this \n\nmethod has been used in the characterization of reservoir properties (porosity, \n\npermeability, viscosity and saturation of oil and gas) (Yao et al., 2010). \n\nThe correlation of relaxation times (T1 and T2) with viscosity/temperature and Larmor \n\nfrequency was analysed by Hirasaki et al. (2003). These authors demonstrated that \n\nrelaxation times T1 and T2 are equal, in crude oils, at low viscosity and can be correlated \n\nwith the ratio of viscosity/temperature. However, for high viscosity crude oils T1 and T2 \n\nare different. T1 is a function of the Larmor frequency while T2 follow the \n\nviscosity/temperature correlation. They concluded that the temperature influences the \n\nviscosity as well as the relaxation time of heavy oils. In Hirasaki et al. (2003) work NMR \n\nwas used to analyse the presence of water, oil and gas in the reservoirs of petroleum, taking \n\ninto account the relationship between diffusivity and relaxation time. From the \n\ninterpretation of the NMR logs it was concluded that: i) water normally presented a large \n\nrelaxation time in rocks due to the surface relaxation on the pore walls with different sizes; \n\nii) the fluids presented different diffusivity, which is a way to distinguish one fluid from \n\nothers; and iii) crude oil presented a huge relaxation time and a large diffusivity \n\ndistribution due to its rich composition in different compounds. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF \n\nPETROLEUM FRACTIONS WITH EMPHASIS IN NMR \n \n\n99 \n\n \n\nRamos et al. (2009) used T2 of protons in the viscosity prediction of crude oils. The \n\nanalysis of the expansion of the \n1\nH raw T2 relaxation curves of four Brazilian crude oil \n\nsamples with different viscosities has demonstrated that there was a decrease in the \n\nrelaxation decay curve when the oil viscosity increased. Therefore, a shorter T2 was \n\nproduced for the sample with high viscosity. As a result, more viscous oil represents a \n\nlower relaxation time and less viscous oil has a larger relaxation time. In crude oil, \n\nsaturated fractions and resins are responsible for a higher contribution to the T2 spectra, \n\naromatics are responsible for a lower contribution while the asphaltene protons are less \n\nexpressive in the T2 spectra. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4. Final Remarks \n\nThe preference of a method to analyse heavy crude oil depends especially on the nature of \n\nthe sample and on the analysis purpose. NMR was chosen as the main technique to be used \n\nin crude oil refining industries that want to characterize the \u201cmessy\u201d that describes the \n\ncrude oil fractions and the obtained refined products. With all analysed references, NMR \n\nhave been proven to be a potential technique in providing information about the physical-\n\nchemical properties and in the structure and chemical composition of crude oils. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nEEXXPPEERRIIMMEENNTTAALL  \n\nPPRROOCCEEDDUURREESS  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter is focused in the description of the physical-chemical techniques and \n\nnuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy used to characterize LVGO, HVGO \n\nand fuel oil.

Samples \n\nLVGO, HVGO and fuel oil are different products presenting different and complex \n\nchemical compositions and consequently different physical-chemical properties.

The determination of such \n\nproperties is normally made taking into account some tests following the ASTM \n\n(American Society for Testing and Materials) norms, the IP (Institute of Petroleum) norms \n\nand other traditional tests. Apart from the samples analysed by these techniques the \n\nsamples undergo an analysis using the NMR spectrometer. All ASTM, IP and other test \n\nprocedures used in this work to characterize the different samples analysed are presented in \n\nTable 4.1. \n\nWith the exception of the LVGO samples, HVGO and fuel oil samples were heated before \n\nuse. A short heating with a lower temperature (no more than one hour with a temperature \n\nhigher than 200 \u00baC) was desirable only to ensure that the samples could be handled. An \n\nexcessive heating could lead to the oxidation of some compounds and to some changes in \n\nthe structure and composition of the samples. The heating, when necessary, and the \n\nhomogenization of the samples were the only treatment needed before starting the analysis \n\nby the standard procedures.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n104 \n \n\nTable 4.1: Identification of samples for properties that were analysed. \n\nProperties LVGO HVGO Fuel Oil \n\nKinematic viscosity 50 \u00baC (ASTM D445)   ? \n\nKinematic viscosity 100 \u00baC (ASTM D445)  ? ? \n\nDensity (ASTM D4052) ?   \n\nDensity (ASTM D5002)  ? ? \n\nCarbon residue (ASTM D4530)  ? ? \n\nP-value (SMS 1600)   ? \n\nSulfur content (IP 336)   ? \n\nDistillation (ISO 3405) ?   \n\nDistillation (ASTM D1160)  ?  \n\nFlash point (ASTM D93)   ? \n1\nH NMR spectra ? ? ? \n\n13\nC NMR spectra   ? \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. Physical-Chemical Characterization \n\n4.2.1. Kinematic Viscosity (ASTM D445) \n\nThe standard test method for kinematic viscosity of transparent and opaque liquids (ASTM \n\nStandards D445, 2009) is a very important procedure in the determination of the kinematic \n\nviscosity of petroleum fuels. The kinematic viscosity is a measure of liquids resistance to \n\nflow. In the determination of this property, the time for a volume of liquid to flow under \n\ngravity through a calibrated glass capillary viscometer under a reproducible driving head \n\nand at a known temperature is measured (Wauquier, 1995; Simanzhenkov et al., 2003; \n\nASTM Standards D445, 2009). In this work the kinematic viscosity of fuel oil and HVGO \n\nsamples was determined. The kinematic viscosity of LVGO samples was not measured \n\nsince the main objective of analysing the LVGO stream was to evaluate its fractionation. \n\nFor that, other properties were considered more important. \n\n \n\nProcedure for transparent liquids, such as HVGO \n\nPrior to measure the kinematic viscosity of any sample it was necessary to select the right \n\nviscometer with an appropriate capillary having a diameter that let the sample flow freely. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n105 \n\n \n\nThe configuration and size of the capillary were calibrated and tested to give a constant \n\nvalue which was specific for each viscometer and helped to differentiate one viscometer \n\nfrom the other. Normally, for the HVGO samples the most common viscometer used was a \n\n150 capillary viscometer Cannon-Fenske. After choosing the viscometer (Figure 4.1, a), it \n\nwas filled, using suction, with the HVGO sample up to the filling mark (1) (Figure 4.1, b) \n\nand then inserted into the viscosity Tamson bath (Figure 4.2) at 100.00\u00b10.02 \u00baC. The \n\nsample was left in the bath during 30 minutes in order to achieve thermal equilibrium \n\n(Figure 4.1, c). Using suction, the sample was adjusted to above the upper timing mark 1 \n\n(Figure 4.1, d) and when it arrived at the first timing mark (1) by gravity, the time required \n\nfor the sample to flow from the first (1) to the second timing mark (2) was measured in \n\nseconds (  ). The procedure was repeated (    ) and the kinematic viscosity ( ) was \n\ndetermined considering the average of the two viscosity values calculated (    ), as will be \n\nexplained posteriorly. \n\n \n\n \n\na) b) c) d) \n\nFigure 4.1: Example of a Cannon-Fenske viscometer for transparent liquids. \n\n \n\n1 \n2 \n\n1 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n106 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2: Viscosity Tamson bath with a viscometer for transparent liquids (ASTM Standards D445, 2009). \n\n \n\nProcedure for opaque liquids, such as fuel oil \n\nThe viscometer mostly used for the fuel oil samples was the 200 capillary viscometer \n\nCannon-Fenske for a determination at 100 \u00baC and the 450 capillary viscometer Cannon-\n\nFenske for a determination at 50 \u00baC (Figure 4.3, a). The procedure was similar with that \n\nused in the determination of the kinematic viscosity of transparent liquids but in this case \n\nthe samples need to be filtered. The viscometer was also filled, using suction, with the fuel \n\noil sample until the filling mark (1) (Figure 4.3, b), and then the viscometer was inserted \n\ninto the bath at 100.00\u00b10.02 \u00baC (Figure 4.2) or 50.00\u00b10.02 \u00baC, letting the sample flow by \n\ngravity until it filled more than half of the first bulb (2) (Figure 4.3, c). When the sample \n\nwas at a rich point a stopper was placed on top at one side of the viscometer (Figure 4.3, \n\nd). To achieve thermal equilibrium, the sample was left in the bath for 30 minutes. After \n\nwhich, the time required for the sample to advance between the first mark (3) to the second \n\none (4) (  ), and from the second to the third mark (5) (  ) was measured in seconds and \n\nrecorded for the kinematic viscosity determination.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n107 \n\n \n\na) \nb) \n\nc) d) \n\nFigure 4.3: Example of a Cannon-Fenske viscometer for opaque liquids. \n\n \n\nIndependently of having an opaque or transparent liquid the way to determine the \n\nkinematic viscosity values,   and   , was the same. Each flow time,    and   , measured \n\nwas multiplied by the respectively viscometer constant,   , by means of the following \n\nequation: \n\n \n\n             (4.1) \n\n \n\nThe final result of the kinematic viscosity,  , was obtained as an average of the two \n\ncalculated values for each sample (    ). To ensure that no mistakes were made, the \n\nkinematic viscosity of one sample was always measured twice using different viscometers, \n\nwith different viscometer constants. With that, it was possible to calculate the repeatability, \n\nthe difference between successive results obtained with the same apparatus under constant \n\noperating conditions and with the same sample, and to evaluate the precision of the test \n\nmethod.  \n\nIn Figure 4.4 and in Figure 4.5 the range of kinematic viscosity variations at 100 \u00baC of all \n\nanalysed HVGO and fuel oil samples is represented.

Density (ASTM D4052 and ASTM D5002) \n\nDensity is an important physical property that can be used to characterize petroleum \n\nproducts and petroleum fractions, in conjugation with other properties. There are different \n\ntypes of ASTM methods, to determine densities, used in the refinery for plant control and \n\nfinished product quality. Examples of used ASTM densities were the ASTM D4052 \n\n(ASTM Standards D4052, 2011) for LVGO characterization, and the ASTM D5002 \n\n(ASTM Standards D5002, 2005) in the analysis of HVGO and fuel oil samples. \n\n \n\nASTM D4052 \u2013 Standard test method for density, relative density and API gravity of \n\nliquids by digital density analyzer \n\nThe ASTM D4052 method can be used for the determination of the density, relative \n\ndensity, and API gravity of petroleum distillates and viscous oils that can be handled as \n\nliquids at the tested temperature between 15 to 35 \u00baC. However, this method is restricted to \n\nliquids with a viscosity value below 15000 cSt and a total vapor pressure typically below \n\n100 kPa. Nevertheless, liquids with a total vapor pressure higher than 100 kPa can also be \n\n0 \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n20 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n103.2-201.6 201.6-300 300-398.4 398.4-496.8 496.8-595.2 595.2-693.6 693.6-792 792-890.4 \n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr\n o\n\nf \nsa\n\nm\np\n\nle\ns \n\n \n\nKinematic viscosity 50 \u00baC (cSt) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n110 \n \n\nanalysed when ensured that the density determination is not affect by other perturbations \n\nsuch as bubbles in the oscillating sample tube. Gasoline and gasoline oxygenate blends, \n\ndiesel, jet, base stocks, waxes and lubricating oils are examples of products that can be \n\nassessed by this method.  \n\nThe density of LVGO was analysed by the standard test method using a digital density \n\nanalyzer DMA 4500 (Figure 4.7). In this method, a small amount (about 1 to 2 mL) of \n\nliquid was measured in an oscillating sample tube and due to the existence of a system for \n\nelectronic excitation and frequency counting, the total mass of a tube was measured by \n\ndetermining its natural frequency of vibration. The oscillating frequency depends on the \n\ndimension and elastic properties of the tube, and on the weight of the tube and of the \n\nsample. The results of the vibration frequency used in conjunction with calibration data \n\nprovided the samples density. With one analysis the apparatus provided two determinations \n\nin the density of the sample and if the two determinations did not differ by more than \n\n0.0002 g/mL the result was accepted. The range of density variations are presented in \n\nFigure 4.8. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7: Digital density analyzer, Anton Paar DMA 4500M (ASTM Standards D4052, 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n111 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8: Histogram for 105 samples on the variation of LVGO density. \n\n \n\n \n\nASTM D5002 \u2013 Standard test method for density and relative density of crude oils by \n\ndensity analyzer \n\nFor HVGO and fuel oil samples it was more appropriate to use the ASTM D5002 standard \n\ntest method. This method can be used to determine the density or relative density of crude \n\noils that can be handled as liquids at tested temperatures between 15 and 35 \u00baC. It can also \n\nbe used in the analysis of crude oils with high vapor pressures and when necessary it can \n\nrequire measurements at higher temperatures to eliminate air bubbles in the sample. For \n\nthese reasons samples as HVGO and fuel oil were analysed with this standard test method. \n\nWe were referring to two dark samples that required some temperature increment to ensure \n\nthat no unseen air or gas bubbles were in the sample. The basic principle of the operation \n\nin the equipment used (Figure 4.9) was similar to the ASTM D4052 standard test method. \n\nBeyond the required temperature, the main difference was related to the quantity of the \n\nsample that was required for the analysis, approximately 0.7 mL.

Carbon Residue (ASTM D4530) \n\nThe standard test method used for the determination of carbon residue (ASTM Standards \n\nD4530, 2007) allowed evaluating the tendency of such materials (HVGO and fuel oil \n\nsamples) to coke formation. The amount of carbon residue produced was dependent on the \n\ntest conditions when evaporation and pyrolysis occurred. \n\nThe procedure used in the determination of this property can be resumed into two main \n\nparts. The first one involved the sample preparation while the second one was related to the \n\nprocessing of the samples. The first step in the preparation of the sample was to heat and \n\nstir the samples until a homogeneous liquid was obtained. This step was only necessary \n\nonce the samples in analysis were HVGO and fuel oil, two samples that when cooled were \n\ndifficult to handle. After that, an appropriate mass of the sample was transfer into a tare \n\nsample vial and then the vial was placed into a vial holder. The required sample mass \n\ndepended on the samples description. In the case of HVGO samples, the recommended \n\nquantity of the sample was 1.5\u00b10.5 g, while for black, viscous or solid samples such as fuel \n\noil, the quantity recommended was 0.15\u00b10.05 g.

The oven (see Figure 4.12) was slowly heated up to 500 \u00baC under an inert \n\n(nitrogen) atmosphere in a controlled manner for a specific time. During this time, the \n\nvolatiles formed with the cooking reactions were swept away by the nitrogen, leaving the \n\ncarbon residue. After a specific period of heating and when the temperature in the oven \n\nwas less than 250 \u00baC, the vial holder was removed for further cooling. The cooling of the \n\nvials was made in a desiccator. When cooled, the vials were weighed.  \n\nThe carbon content in the original sample was calculated as the ratio between the weight of \n\nthe carbon left and a percentage of the weight of the original sample, as in the following \n\nequation: \n\n \n\n                 \n       \n\n \n (4.2) \n\n \n\nwhere   was the mass of carbon residue (g) and   the mass of the sample used (g). \n\nIn Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14 the range of carbon residue (% m/m) variations of all \n\nHVGO and fuel oil samples analysed are represented. Information about the carbon residue \n\nof LVGO samples is not given since this property was not included in the characterization \n\nof the LVGO samples. As previously mentioned, the carbon residue gives indication of the \n\namount of coke that will be formed during thermal processes as well as of the amount of \n\nhigh boiling constituents. As LVGO samples are rich in lower boiling fractions and contain \n\ninsignificant quantities of coke precursors a lower carbon residue is expected. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n115 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12: Coking oven, Alcor MCRT-160 (ASTM Standards D4530, 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13: Histogram for 142 samples on the variation of HVGO carbon residue. \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n20 \n\n25 \n\n30 \n\n35 \n\n40 \n\n45 \n\n0.08-0.13 0.13-0.18 0.18-0.23 0.23-0.28 0.28-0.33 0.33-0.38 0.38-0.43 0.43-0.48 0.48-0.53 0.58-0.63 0.68-0.73 0.83-0.88 0.98-1.03 \n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr\n o\n\nf \nsa\n\nm\np\n\nle\ns \n\n \n\nCarbon residue (% m/m) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n116 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14: Histogram for 103 samples on the variation of fuel oil carbon residue. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.4. Sulfur Content (IP 336) \n\nThe IP 336 method (IP Standards 336, 2004) is used in the determination of sulfur content \n\nin products having sulfur contents in the range 0.03 (% m/m) to 5.00 (% m/m) such as \n\nnaphthas, distillates, fuel oils, residues, lubricating base oils and unleaded gasolines. In this \n\nwork the IP 336 method was used to determinate the sulfur content in fuel oils. LVGO and \n\nHVGO samples were not analysed by the IP 336 method once the sulfur content in these \n\nsamples was expected to be very small. It is in the higher molecular weight fractions, such \n\nas the residue, that the greater concentration of sulfur compounds is located. Generally, the \n\nsulfur compounds found in crude oils have tendency to concentrate in residue. Farther, to \n\ndetermine the sulfur content of the fuel oil samples, the energy-dispersive X-ray \n\nfluorescence analyzer (Figure 4.15) was used. \n\n \n\n0 \n\n5 \n\n10 \n\n15 \n\n20 \n\n25 \n\n12.9-13.7 13.7-14.5 14.5-15.3 15.3-16.1 16.1-16.9 16.9-17.7 17.7-18.5 18.5-19.3 19.3-20.1 20.1-20.9 20.9-21.7 21.7-22.1 \n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr\n o\n\nf \nsa\n\nm\np\n\nle\ns \n\nCarbon residue (% m/m) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n117 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.15: Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analyzer, Oxford Instruments, Lab-X3500SCL (IP Standards 336, \n\n2004). \n\n \n\nIn this procedure, a sample cell equipped with a thin transparent film was filled with the \n\nsample for the X-ray. The sample cell was placed in an analyzer detector in the beam \n\nemitted from a suitable low energy radioactive source, such as \n55\n\nFe source, and \n\nconsequently irradiated by primary X-radiation. The basic operation principle of this \n\nanalyzer is related to the X-ray fluorescence analytical method. This method explains that, \n\ndue to the effect of the radiation, some electrons of the internal shells are ejected by the \n\nexciting radiation and with that they go to higher energy levels. Due to the movement of \n\nthe electrons to other energy levels, electrons coming from higher levels occupy the \n\n\u201choles\u201d create when the exited electrons turn away. This electronic rearrangement is \n\nresponsible for the emission of the secondary X-radiation whose wavelengths are \n\ncharacteristic in the bombarded element. Each element can represent emissions of many \n\ndifferent wavelengths depending on the internal electronic transitions. When electrons are \n\nejected by the exciting radiation, the electrons from higher energy levels \u201cfall down\u201d to \n\ntake the void place of K, L and M left by the electrons (as shown in Figure 4.16). This \n\nmeans that an emission    results from the movement of the electron arriving at the K \n\nshell and departing from the L shell. The index   refers that the origin of the transition was \n\nat a level above. In   and   index the origins of the transition were at two and three levels \n\nabove, respectively.

Flash Point (ASTM D93) \n\nThe standard test method for flash point by Pensky-Martens closed cup tester (ASTM \n\nStandards D93, 2011) is the test method used in the determination of the flash point of \n\npetroleum products, at a temperature range from 40 to 360 \u00baC, and of biodiesel at a \n\ntemperature range of 60 to 190 \u00baC. The flash point is an indispensable property that should \n\nbe used for evaluating the flammability of a petroleum cut, since it is described as a \n\nmeasure in the tendency of the material to form a flammable mixture with air. The \n\nprocedure in this method consisted in filling the brass test cup up to the inside mark with \n\nthe analysed sample. After that the sample was heated and stirred at a specified rate in the \n\nautomated apparatus \u2013 HFP 360 Flash Point Analyzers (Figure 4.18). Then an ignition \n\nsource in the form of a small flame directly into the test cup at regular intervals was \n\napplied. When a flash was seen in the sample the flash point was found. The temperature at \n\nthe moment of the flash was noted as the flash point of the sample. Figure 4.19 presents the \n\nresults obtained with the application of the ASTM D93 on fuel oil samples. The flash point \n\nof LVGO and HVGO samples was not determined. Besides the important information \n\nobtained with the analysis of the flash point, this property was not used in LVGO and \n\nHVGO characterization once the determination of other properties were considered more \n\nsignificant to the required evaluation.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n120 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18: Pensky-Martens closed flash tester, HFP 360 Flash Point Analyzers (ASTM Standards D93, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.19: Histogram for 157 samples on the variation of fuel oil flash point. \n\n \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n49-55 55-61 61-67 67-73 73-79 79-85 85-91 91-97 97-102 \n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr\n o\n\nf \nsa\n\nm\np\n\nle\ns \n\nFlash point (\u00baC) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n121 \n\n \n\n4.2.6. P-Value (SMS 1600) \n\nThe P-value, also called peptization value test, allows obtaining information on stability \n\nand stability reserve required in refinery process control. This stability is directly related \n\nwith the asphaltenes precipitation and the data obtained with this method will avoid \n\nundesirable asphaltenes precipitation and will improve production efficiencies. The SMS \n\n1600 \u2013 state of peptization of asphaltenes in heavy oil streams \u2013 (Shell Method Series \n\n1600, 2001) describes the tendency of asphaltenes precipitation in residues and residual \n\nfuel oils having a viscosity value less than       cSt at 50 \u00baC. In the realization of this \n\nmethod an automated procedure using a commercially available automated stability \n\nanalyzer (Zematra ASA Automated Stability Analyzer; Figure 4.20) was used. An amount \n\nof the sample (approximately 12 g), heated and stirred at specified rates in the automated \n\napparatus, was diluted with cetane (hexadecane). The quantity of cetane used depended on \n\nthe quantity required to reach the point of instability, which meant, that the sample become \n\nunstable after the injection of a measured quantity of cetane. The point of instability \n\n(asphaltene flocculation point) was determined by measuring the reflection of light by the \n\nasphaltenes that had precipitated on the glass surface in the optrode device. The P-value \n\n(stability reserve) was automatically calculated (Figure 4.21) taking into account the \n\nnumber of mL of cetane with which one gram of the sample can be diluted until it doesn\u2019t \n\nflocculate the asphaltenes (    ): \n\n \n\n               (4.3) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n122 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.20: Zematra ASA automated stability analyzer for residual refinery streams and fuel oils (Shell Method Series \n\n1600, 2001). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.21: Histogram for 213 samples on the variation of fuel oil P-value. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n\n10 \n\n20 \n\n30 \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n70 \n\n80 \n\n1.0-1.1 1.1-1.2 1.2-1.3 1.3-1.4 1.4-1.5 1.5-1.6 1.6-1.7 1.7-1.8 \n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ne\nr\n o\n\nf \nsa\n\nm\np\n\nle\ns \n\nP-value \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n123 \n\n \n\n4.2.7. Distillation at Atmospheric Pressure (ISO 3405) \n\nTo determine the distillation of LVGO products the ISO 3405 (ISO Standards 3405, 2011) \n\n\u2013 determination of distillation characteristics at atmospheric pressure - was used. This \n\ninternational standard method can be used to determine the distillation characteristics of \n\nlight and middle distillates derived from petroleum and having initial boiling points above \n\n0 \u00baC and end points not above 400 \u00baC.  \n\nAn automated device, Herzog Atmospheric Distillation HAD 627, was used in the \n\ndetermination of LVGO distillation (Figure 4.22). This method used a standard round \n\nbottom distillation flask with a capacity of 125 mL attached to a water cooled condenser. \n\nThe thermometer bulb was introduced into the top of the distillation flask using an \n\nappropriate snug-fitting device that held the temperature sensor in the middle of the neck in \n\nthe distillation flask. A 100 mL of the sample was placed in the flask and heated by a small \n\ngas flame. The temperature of the initial boiling point was read when the first condensate \n\ndrop entered the receiving cylinder at the end of the condensate bath. The test was \n\ncontinued at a constant rate and systematic observations of thermometer readings and \n\nvolumes of condensate recovered were made at determined recovery levels of \n\ncondensation. The final boiling point, the highest temperature observed, was also recorded \n\n(ISO Standards 3405, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.22: Herzog atmospheric distillation HAD 627 apparatus (ISO Standards 3405, 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n124 \n \n\n4.2.8. Distillation at Reduced Pressure (ASTM D1160) \n\nThe ASTM D1160 \u2013 Standard test method for distillation of petroleum products at \n\nreduced pressure \u2013 was used for determining the range of boiling points in HVGO \n\nproducts (ASTM Standards D1160, 2006). This method can also be used in the \n\ndetermination of the distillation characteristics of petroleum products that can be partially \n\nor completely vaporized at a maximum liquid temperature of 400 \u00baC at controlled pressure \n\nbetween 1 and 50 mmHg. In this method, a 200 mL of the sample was weighed, into the \n\ndistillation flask. The distillation apparatus, Herzog Vacuum Distillation HDV 632, (Figure \n\n4.23) was evacuated until the pressure reached the prescribed level for distillation. After \n\nthe desired pressure level was obtained, the heat was applied to the flash as quickly as \n\npossible taking into account that undue foaming of the sample cannot occurred. When \n\nvapor or refluxing liquid appeared at the neck of the flask, the heating rate was adjust to \n\nrecover at 6-8 mL/min until the distillation was completed. Data from vapor temperature, \n\ntime and pressure at different volume percentage fractions of the charge collected in the \n\nreceiver were recorded. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.23: Herzog vacuum distillation HDV 632 apparatus (ASTM Standards D1160, 2006). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n125 \n\n \n\nAll procedures previously described were used to determine the required physical-chemical \n\nproperties. A summary of all properties analysed with indication of the number of samples \n\nstudied is presented in Table 4.2. In Table 4.2 it is also indicated the test time required to \n\nanalyse each sample. This test time comprises the time required to prepare the samples, the \n\ntime needed to make the analysis using the standard methods and the time required to clean \n\nthe material used. As visualized, the standard methods used in this work were time-\n\nconsuming, some of them requiring many hours before the final result were obtained. \n\nCarbon residue was the standard method most time-consuming. The analysis of P-value of \n\nfuel oil samples could also take, at maximum 3 hours. However, depending on the sample \n\ncomposition this property could be determined in just 1 hour. To make a comparison \n\nbetween all procedures used to analyse each sample, Table 4.2 presents the time required \n\nto obtain a \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra. The procedure used to obtain a \n\n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR \n\nspectra will be explained in the following section. It was possible to conclude that, from all \n\nexperimental procedures used, it was quicker to obtain a \n1\nH NMR spectrum. It was verified \n\nthat 25 minutes were enough to obtain a \n1\nH NMR spectrum and, when using \n\n1\nH NMR \n\nspectroscopy in combination with multivariate models, 25 minutes were enough to obtain \n\nthe information about all the physical-chemical properties. On the other hand, many hours \n\nwere needed to obtain a complete quality information of the samples in analysis when \n\nfollowing the procedure of the traditional standard methods. In addition, the use of some of \n\nthese standard methods required extensive handling and sample preparation. \n\nBesides, the identification of the properties studied, the number of samples analysed and \n\nthe time required to develop a procedure, in Table 4.2 the minimum and maximum value \n\nobtained for each property and for each sample is also shown. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.2: Number of samples, test time and minimum and maximum results for properties that were analysed. \n\n  \nnumber of samples analysed  test time results [minimum;maximum] \n\n  \nLVGO HVGO Fuel Oil  LVGO HVGO Fuel Oil \n\nP\nr\no\np\n\ne\nr\nti\n\ne\ns \n\nKinematic viscosity 50 \u00baC (cSt) - ASTM D445 \n \n\n 108             \n  \n\n[103.2;890.4] \n\nKinematic viscosity 100 \u00baC (cSt) - ASTM D445 \n \n\n168 217             \n \n\n[8.050;18.60] [14.20;1367] \n\nDensity (g/mL) - ASTM D4052 105           [0.8592;0.9050] \n \n\n \n\nDensity (g/mL) - ASTM D5002 \n \n\n189 185         \n \n\n[0.9152;0.9609] [0.9487;1.019] \n\nCarbon residue (% m/m) - ASTM D4530 \n \n\n142 103      \n \n\n[0.08;1.03]] [12.9;22.1] \n\nP-value - SMS 1600 \n \n\n 217      \n  \n\n[1.00;1.8] \n\nSulfur content (% m/m) - IP 336 \n \n\n 213         \n  \n\n[0.53;3.54] \n\nDistillation (?C) - ISO 3405 105        * \n \n\n \n\nDistillation (?C) - ASTM D1160 \n \n\n116       \n \n\n*  \n\nFlash point (?C) - ASTM D93 \n \n\n 157         \n  \n\n[49;102] \n\n1\nH NMR spectra 105 214 222         \n\n1\nH NMR spectrum \n\n13\nC NMR spectra \n\n \n 63             \n\n  \n\n13\nC NMR \n\nspectrum \n\n(*) The results of the distillation depends on the distillation cut. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n127 \n\n \n\n4.3. NMR Experiments \n\nThe NMR spectroscopy was used to chemically characterize all the samples previously \n\nanalysed by means of the ASTM standard methods. The main idea was to carry out a \n\nquantitative analysis of all samples. To obtain high quality spectra, the NMR spectra were \n\nrecorded with a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer (Figure 4.24) operating at atmospheric \n\ntemperature and 300.13 MHz for proton and 75.47 MHz for carbon. \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR \n\nspectra were recorded in the work hereby reported.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.24: Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer. \n\n \n\n4.3.1. \n1\nH NMR Experiments \n\nThe \n1\nH NMR spectra were recorded using the following conditions: spectral with 6887 Hz, \n\nwith a 30\u00ba pulse width (3.63 ?s), 2.4 s acquisition time, 1 s relaxation delay, 32768 K data \n\npoints and 128 scans. Very good signal to noise (S/N) ratio was obtained under these \n\nexperimental conditions. The NMR spectrum was acquired using a high quality tube with 5 \n\nmm diameter. The HVGO and fuel oil samples were prepared diluting 0.2000 g of the \n\nsample into 1 mL of deuteriochloroform (CDCl3) while for LVGO samples 0.35 mL of \n\nCDCl3 was used to dissolve 0.25 mL of the samples. In both preparations, an internal \n\nreference such as the tetramethylsilane [Si(CH3)4], commonly abbreviated as TMS, was \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n128 \n \n\nused. This internal reference defines the zero of the chemical shift scale and thus improves \n\nthe precision of the quantitative and qualitative analysis. An example of LVGO, HVGO \n\nand fuel oil spectrum is presented in Figure 4.25, Figure 4.26 and Figure 4.27, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.25: Example of a LVGO \n1\nH NMR spectrum. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.26: Example of a HVGO \n1\nH NMR spectrum. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n129 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.27: Example of a fuel oil \n1\nH NMR spectrum. \n\n \n\nApparently, it is not possible to highlight the main differences between the three spectra \n\nhere presented. All spectra, LVGO, HVGO and fuel oil spectrum, present an aromatic and \n\nan aliphatic region. However, to indicate which of the samples present a high quantity of \n\naromatic or aliphatic hydrogens a more detailed analysis of the spectra should be \n\nperformed. For that, the integration of the spectrum is required. Such comparison is \n\nperformed and discussed in Chapter 6. \n\n \n\n4.3.2. \n13\n\nC NMR Experiments \n\nTo obtain a quantitative spectrum, an inverse gate decoupling \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum was \n\nused. The important parameters used in recording such \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum were the \n\nfollowing: i) spectral with 20000 Hz; ii) with a 30\u00ba pulse width (1.5 ?s); iii) 8 h acquisition \n\ntime; iv) 6 s relaxation delay; v) 32 K data points; and vi) 4224 scans. As in the \n1\nH NMR \n\nexperiments, very good signal to noise (S/N) ratio was obtained under the previously \n\ndescribed experimental conditions. The \n13\n\nC NMR solution was prepared using the same \n\ntube as the ones used in the \n1\nH NMR experiments, a tube with 5 mm diameter. The \n\nsamples analysed by \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy were the fuel oil samples. The samples were \n\nprepared by dissolving 0.2000 g of the sample into 1 mL of deuteriochloroform (CDCl3). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n130 \n \n\nThe tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal reference was also used. In contrast to \n1\nH NMR \n\nspectroscopy, a small amount of paramagnetic relaxation reagent such as \n\ntrisacetylacetonatochromium(III) [Cr(acac)3] was add into the NMR solution. The idea of \n\nusing the Cr(acac)3 was to reduce the long relaxation times of carbons and to avoid the \n\nnuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE), related to the increase in signal intensity when C-\n\nH coupled protons were saturated by the decoupling field (Altgelt et al., 1994). The use of \n\nCr(acac)3 contributed in obtaining a quantitative spectrum (as example, Figure 4.28), \n\nwhich the advantage was the peak areas, in different molecular positions, where \n\nproportional to their concentration, which didn\u2019t occur in a normal \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum. \n\nAs will be presented in Chapter 6, the use of \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy to provide the \n\nphysical-chemical properties of the analysed samples will be not considered in this work. \n\nThe main reason for not using the \n13\n\nC NMR was the time required to obtain a quantitative \n\nresult necessary to develop reliable models (see Table 4.2, page 126). Since \n13\n\nC NMR \n\nspectroscopy will not be considered in this work, the analysis of the LVGO and HVGO \n\nsamples were not made by \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.28: Example of a fuel oil inverse gate decoupling \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n131 \n\n \n\nAs occur for the \n1\nH NMR spectrum, to comment the \n\n13\nC quantitative NMR spectrum \n\n(Figure 4.28) the integration of the spectrum is required. In Chapter 6 the integration of the \n\n13\nC NMR spectrum is presented in an attempt to understand fuel oil composition. \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Pre-Measuring Steps \n\nAs it is well known the quality of the NMR data depended on some experimental factors \n\nthat need to be controlled and respected such as: i) sample preparation; ii) data acquisition; \n\niii) pulse sequence; iv) optimization of instrumental parameters; and v) pre-processing \n\ndata. \n\n \n\nSample preparation \n\nAs mentioned before, there were some precautions which had to be taken during the \n\npreparation of the sample. The quantity of each constituent that formed the final sample, \n\nthe crude oil fraction, the solvent and the paramagnetic relaxation reagent, when used, need \n\nto be measured with some precision for obtaining adequate quantitative measurements. It \n\nwas important that all samples, especially fuel oil samples, should be filtered before placed \n\nin the NMR sample tube to avoid the presence of solid impurities that will degrade the \n\nhomogeneity of the magnetic field. The selection of the solvent used was also very \n\nimportant. The solvent used in all preparations, as referred, was the deuteriochloroform \n\n(CDCl3) once it had a high dissolving power (Christian et al., 1986) and the spectrometer \n\nneeded a deuterium (\n2\nH) signal to \u201clock\u201d the magnetic field strength and prevent it from \n\nchanging with time. TMS was chosen as an internal reference since it is an inert, a low-\n\nboiling liquid, and gives rise to a single line in the spectrum. Such facts occur due to all the \n\nprotons in the symmetrical molecule having an identical environmental, and all protons in \n\nTMS resonate at a higher field than practically any other proton (Christian et al., 1986; \n\nClaridge, 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n132 \n \n\nComputer controlled NMR spectrometers \n\nAs seen in Section 3.2.3, the NMR spectrometer was controlled by a computer which was \n\nused to collect, digitize and perform the Fourier transformation of the signals. There were \n\nsome experimental variables that were digitally defined at the beginning of the experiment. \n\nThese variables were the size of the data table ( ), the acquisition time (  ), in seconds, \n\nand the spectral width (  ), in Hertz, of the transformed spectrum. The data table can be \n\nexpressed as followed: \n\n \n\n         (4.4) \n\n \n\nwith   related to the number of addresses to be filled and responsible with the limits for \n\nthe eventual resolution attainable (Christian et al., 1986). Additionally, there were other \n\nvariables with high importance such as the pulse width and the delay time. The pulse width \n\nwas defined as the time, in microseconds, during which the radio frequency pulse was \n\napplied. The delay time was referred to the time, in seconds, between pulses sequences and \n\ncan be used to allow nuclei to reach magnetic equilibrium or \u201crelax\u201d.  \n\n \n\nInstrumental variables \n\nThere were many instrumental variables that were controlled such as the amplification, \n\nnoise filtering, phasing of signals, width of sweep, adjustments of field homogeneity and \n\nthe amplitude of the radio frequency radiation. This last variable, the amplitude of the radio \n\nfrequency radiation, when too high can be responsible for increased sensitivity. For this \n\nreason the amplitude of the radio frequency radiation was set at a value that only saturates \n\nsome of the resonances, in a real sample, over the finite range of relaxation times \n\n(Christian et al., 1986). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n133 \n\n \n\n4.3.4. Data Pre-Processing \n\nIn this section some of the pre-processing and data manipulations used to improve the \n\nperformance of the subsequent multivariate data methods are reviewed. This pre-\n\nprocessing of the NMR data is always necessary if quantitative NMR spectroscopy is \n\ndesirable. A set of necessary processing steps, as shown in Figure 4.29, must be \n\nimplemented to minimize or eliminate artifacts (resulting from experimental variations) \n\nand to enhance resolution or signal to noise ratio (Becker, 2000). To apply these pre-\n\nprocessing steps it was important to obtain the spectrum that was acquired with the \n\napplication of the Fourier transform to the FID signal. After that, the spectrum can be \n\nmanipulated or transformed to produce the data set for multivariate analysis. These \n\ndifferent types of data manipulations are described: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.29: Example of a flow chart of the different steps that can be utilized during the analysis of NMR spectral data. \n\n1.

Phase and Baseline Correction \n\nThe main difficulties encountered in the analysis of NMR data were related with the \n\nbaseline distortions and variations in the spectral phasing between spectra. These variations \n\ncould be the result from chemically induced changes and/or instrumental and temperature \n\ninstability, field inhomogeneities and sample susceptibility effects (Alam et al., 2004). If in \n\neach single spectrum no correction was made, difficulties in accurately determining peak \n\nareas (quantification) and problems in classification when using some multivariate \n\nmethods could be found. \n\nAs previously stated, the phase correction of the spectrum was indispensable to optimize \n\nthe appearance of the overall spectrum and to obtain the desired peak shape (Jacobsen, \n\n2007). After Fourier transform, the signals of the spectrum could be decomposed into \n\nabsorptive and dispersive signals as indicated in Figure 4.30. The application of the phase \n\ncorrection was needed to yield purely absorptive signals (absorption mode). The NMR \n\nspectra were preferred in the absorption mode as it comprises a higher resolution and a \n\nhigher proportionality between the integral of peaks and the number of nuclei which cause \n\nthe signal, when compared with the dispersion mode.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.30: Peak signal in pure absorption or dispersion mode (Zerbe, 2010). \n\n \n\nThe baseline correction was also very important to obtain all signals connected by a flat \n\nline and with that, obtained a good quality spectrum. Besides that, a good baseline gave \n\ngood results in quantitative measurements where integral calculations were required \n\ndispersion mode \n\nabsorption mode \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n135 \n\n \n\n(McKenzie et al., 2011). The baseline can be defined as the average of the noise part of the \n\nspectrum that should ideally be straight and a horizontal line representing zero intensity. \n\nPhasing and baseline distortions affect the quality of the spectra, reason why it is important \n\nto adjust and correct the spectra, automatically or manually. In the past, manually \n\ncorrection was used but soon standard commercial and public domain NMR software \n\nprograms including methods to automatically correct these variations were developed. In \n\nthis study, the phase and baseline were automatically adjusted and corrected by using the \n\nMestreNova 5.0.3 (Mnova) software (Mestrelab Research - Chemistry Software Solutions, \n\n2012). \n\n \n\n4.3.4.2. Chemical Shift Alignment \n\nAll spectra obtained were aligned to the TMS signal at zero ppm (Figure 4.31). This \n\nprocedure, the alignment of the spectrum to a reference peak, was important to acquire a \n\nuseful chemical shift scale and to compare all spectra considered. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.31: \n1\nH NMR spectrum of a fuel oil with reference of the TMS signal. \n\nTMS signal  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n136 \n \n\nTo ensure that all spectra analysed had the TMS signal at zero ppm, a simple procedure \n\nimplemented in Matlab 2011a (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was used to \n\nautomatically adjust the TMS signal at 0.0 ppm. This type of chemical shift alignment was \n\nalways used in this work due to the good results obtained. However other procedures were \n\nalso tried and implemented, such as: \n\n- alignment of the spectra to the solvent peak as a chemical shift reference; \n\n- alignment of the spectra to another important and non-sensitive signal such as CH3 \n\nsignals; \n\n- alignment of the spectra according to a reference spectrum; \n\n- alignment of the aromatic region to the solvent peak (CDCl3) and the aliphatic \n\nregion to the TMS signal. \n\nThese procedures were not used during the pre-processing of the data once the results \n\nobtained when applying the multivariate data methods were not as good as when compared \n\nwith the alignment of the spectrum to the TMS signal. \n\nIn the scientific literature there are some studies referring the use of chemical shift \n\nalignment in terms of peak position (Stoyanova et al., 2004; Forshed et al., 2005; Guo et \n\nal., 2008; Savorani et al., 2010; McKenzie et al., 2011). Example of some methods are the \n\npartial linear fit (PLF) (Forshed et al., 2005), dynamic time warping (DTW) (Savorani et \n\nal., 2010; McKenzie et al., 2011), the correlation optimized warping (COW) (Savorani et \n\nal., 2010; McKenzie et al., 2011), the multiplicative signal correction (MSC) (Kramer et \n\nal., 2008) and the icoshift algorithm (Savorani et al., 2010). In this study, the multiplicative \n\nsignal correction (MSC) algorithm was applied. With the MSC each spectrum was \n\nregressed against a \u201cstandard\u201d spectrum and compared one by one with the line segments \n\nof the \u201cstandard\u201d spectrum. Each spectrum was then shifted and aligned with the \n\n\u201cstandard\u201d spectrum (Kramer et al., 2008). However, this type of algorithm was not used \n\nin this study due to the unsatisfactory obtained results after the multivariate data methods, \n\nwhen comparing with the alignment of the spectrum to the TMS signal. This lead to \n\nconclude that the use of peak alignment algorithm in these types of samples, which forces \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n137 \n\n \n\nthe variation of the peak position, can slightly reduce the predicted ability of the model \n\ndeveloped and should only be employed when strictly necessary. \n\n \n\n4.3.4.3. Data Reduction  \n\nData reduction is used to advantageously reduce the unused or undesired spectral regions. \n\nIt can be used to remove just a signal or a spectral area with some noise or a non-viable \n\nregion. In this research, data reduction was used: i) to remove the TMS signal that didn\u2019t \n\nbring chemical information; ii) to remove the signal of the solvent used (CDCl3); and iii) to \n\nremove the region between 4.5 and 6.3 ppm since it was a region where no important \n\ninformation occurred and where spectral signatures of additives or other chemical species \n\nappeared. \n\n \n\n4.3.4.4. Binning \n\nBinning process has been considerably used for NMR data especially in the development \n\nof multivariate classification models. Binning involves the calculation of peak areas within \n\nspecified segments of a spectrum (binning or bucketing) (Craig et al., 2006; McKenzie et \n\nal., 2011) becoming the resulting \u201cspectrum\u201d the input variable instead of the real NMR \n\nspectrum. It is evident that there is a reduction in the number of variables in the resulting \n\n\u201cspectrum\u201d and a reduction in the spectral resolution. This procedure is a rapid and \n\nconsistent method that simplifies the data by reducing its size and smoothes out alignment \n\nerrors between different samples. It also contributes to the elimination of the impact of \n\nsmall chemical shift variations (especially due to concentration) between different samples \n\non the subsequent multivariate analysis. The most frequently bin size used in the NMR \n\nspectra is a bin width in the range of 0.02 to 0.04 ppm (Alam et al., 2004; Flumignan et al., \n\n2012). In this work, the most frequent used bin was 0.02 ppm due to better results that \n\nwere obtained after applying multivariate data methods.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n138 \n \n\n4.3.4.5. Normalization \n\nNormalization methods are data pre-processing approaches used when comparisons \n\nbetween spectra are required. Normally, in optimal conditions, the NMR peaks integrals \n\nare directly proportional to concentrations, in quantitative analysis. However, there are \n\nsome experimental and instrumental variables that can affect the absolute NMR peak \n\nintensities. For this reason the normalization, to remove or minimize the effects of such \n\nvariables, is used. In the present work, the normalization of the data used involved setting \n\neach spectrum to have unit total intensity by expressing each spectrum segment as a \n\nfraction of the total spectrum integral. Other alternative normalization approach, such as, \n\nnormalization by the maximum peak of the spectrum and normalization by a given area \n\n(0.25 to 0.27 ppm) were also applied. The best results were obtained when using the \n\nnormalization by the total spectrum integral. \n\n \n\n4.3.4.6.  Intensity Scaling  \n\nScaling is a part of multivariate analysis which can significantly improve the rate of \n\nidentification and separation of groups during classification, normalizing the relative \n\nimportance of each variable (Alam et al., 2004). Scaling should be used when there is no \n\ninformation about variable importance and, as previously stated, to regulate the importance \n\nof each variable in the model due to the existence of largest and smallest spectral features. \n\nWhen no scaling is applied the largest spectral features, which are not necessary more \n\nimportant than those present in a lower concentration, can obscure systematic variation of \n\ninterest in the low intensity regions (Alam et al., 2004). In the literature it is possible to \n\nfind some scaling methods including mean-centering (Cloarec et al., 2004; Craig et al., \n\n2006), variable stability (VAST) scaling (Keun et al., 2003), scaling to unit variance \n\n(autoscaling) (Craig et al., 2006) and Pareto scaling (Keun et al., 2003). In this study, \n\nmean-centering scaling was used to emphasize weaker spectral component and the \n\nautoscaling was also used to obligate the variables to have equal probability of influencing \n\nthe model (Figure 4.32). With the mean-centering the average value of each column was \n\ncalculated and then each column could be given a mean of zero by subtracting the column \n\nmean from each value in the column. While, applying the autoscaling meant scaling each \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \n\n139 \n\n \n\ncolumn to have unit variance by dividing each variable in the column by the standard \n\ndeviation of the column and, therefore, giving equal weight to each variable.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.32: Representation of the scaling methods used: after mean-centering and autoscaling all variables will have \n\nmean zero and unit variance.

Creation of Data Set for Multivariate Analysis \n\nAfter applying all different types of data manipulations to each spectrum, a NMR data \n\nmatrix composed by the spectra was obtained. Each different spectrum was composed of n \n\nareas for the frequencies within the observable spectral window as shown in Figure 4.33. \n\nThis NMR data matrix could now be submitted to a multivariate analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.33: Creation of data set for multivariate analysis after applying data pre-processing to each spectrum. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n \n\n140 \n \n\n4.4. Final Remarks \n\nAnalysing the procedures and sample preparation in the methods used during this research \n\nit was verified that these methods were elaborate, time-consuming, presenting some of \n\nthem tedious preparations and requiring large amount of samples when compared with the \n\nNMR spectroscopy. As demonstrated, the impact of the pre-processing procedure on the \n\nanalysis of NMR spectral data can be very significant in the subsequent multivariate \n\nanalysis. Phase and baseline correction, chemical shift alignment, intensity scaling, \n\nnormalization, binning and data reduction were the main pre-processing steps used. These \n\ndifferent types of data manipulations were demonstrated to be very important and \n\nnecessary to exploit the information content on the NMR data, increase the prospect of \n\ndetecting subtle changes in the NMR data and enhance the interpretability of the resulting \n\nmultivariate models. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nPPRREEDDIICCTTIIOONN  UUSSIINNGG  \n\nMMUULLTTIIVVAARRIIAATTEE  MMEETTHHOODDSS  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe difficulty and complexity associated with the interpretation of NMR spectra, \n\nfrom crude oil and derivatives require the development of powerful multivariate \n\nmodels to explore the information of such complex spectra.

State of the Art \n\nThe analysis of crude oil and derivatives using NMR spectroscopy requires the application \n\nof sophisticated chemometric techniques to extract the meaningful information from the \n\ncomplex and highly informative spectra. Normally the information about these types of \n\nsamples, whose molecular structure of most compounds were very complex, could not be \n\neasily assessed due to the many overlapping peaks in the NMR spectra. The development \n\nof chemometric techniques overcome this NMR disadvantage and the possibility of \n\napplying multivariate methods to establish correlations between the spectral data and \n\nsample properties which were determined by the conventional techniques.  \n\nThe use of chemometric techniques to compute models for extracting chemical information \n\nin a NMR crude oil spectrum has quickly become an important tool for the NMR \n\nspectroscopy, allowing both qualitative and quantitative information to be obtained from \n\nthese complex spectral signals. Chemometric analysis are mathematical and statistical \n\nmethods responsible for decomposing the complex multivariate data into simple and \n\nrelevant information, focusing on the important variances within the data (Miller et al., \n\n2005; Kiralj et al., 2006). Many developments in the chemometric methods have emerged \n\nand the combination of multivariate models and the NMR spectra have been used in the \n\nanalysis of crude oil (Kvalheim et al., 1985; Molina et al., 2007; de Peinder et al., 2009; \n\nSilva et al., 2011; Masili et al., 2012). Although very few, some studies have been found in \n\nliterature referring the use of statistical models in the analysis of heavy crude oil fractions \n\nsuch as fuel oil (Nielsen et al., 2008). However, to our knowledge, published works using \n\nstatistical models in the analysis of LVGO and HVGO were not found. \n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA), principal component regression (PCR), partial least \n\nsquares (PLS) and artificial neural networks (ANN) are examples of important techniques \n\nof multivariate data analysis that can be applied to spectral data to extract significant \n\ninformation from the complex and highly informative spectra. These techniques allow the \n\nconstruction of models that can predict macroscopic properties of mixtures of crude oils \n\nfrom NMR measurements (Aske et al., 2002). \n\nVery briefly, PCA is a method of data analysis applied in contexts where there are several \n\nvariables collected in each observation. The idea is to transform all these correlated \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n144 \n \n\nvariables into a reduced set of variables called the principal components. The main \n\nobjectives of PCA are to reduce the size of the data and analyse the structure relationship \n\nbetween the variables and observations (Alam et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2005). In simple \n\nterms, PCR is a regression model that combines principal component analysis and linear \n\nregression. In PCR, some of the principal components are used instead of all original \n\nvariables, reducing in this way the number of predictor variables (Alam et al., 2004). PLS \n\nregression generates and combines characteristics from principal component regression \n\nand multiple regression. PLS seeks to estimate the subspace that best explains the \n\nvariability in the  -axis, also describing the variability in the  -axis. The interpretation of \n\nPLS model allows the analysis of the relative importance of variables   in predicting   \n\n(McKenzie et al., 2011). ANN regression is a mathematical model that contributes to \n\nsimulate the structure and/or the functional aspects of the sample. They are usually \n\nassociated with nodes or processing units and responsible to establish relationships \n\nbetween other units, receiving inputs and sending outputs, finding some patterns in \n\ncomplex data sets (Fraser et al., 1997). \n\nMolina et al. (2007; 2010) developed a new PLS based method contributing to the yield \n\nanalysis and to the analysis of the principal physical-chemical properties of a crude oil \n\nmixture. Taking into account some studied physical-chemical properties, like the gravity \n\nvalues (\u00baAPI), KUOP factor, wax content, and correlation index (IC) it was confirmed the \n\ncomposition of the crudes studied (paraffinic or aromatic) (Molina V et al., 2010). For \n\nexample, the crude classified as the most paraffinic was characterized as presenting the \n\nhighest value of \u00baAPI and KUOP factor, while the most aromatic one was characterized for \n\nhaving low values of \u00baAPI and KUOP factor. It was also observed that when the paraffinic \n\nhydrocarbons content decreases and the aromatic resins and asphaltenes contents increases, \n\nother properties\u2019 values increase such as the sulfur, nitrogen, vanadium and nickel content, \n\nthe percentage of insolubles in n-pentane (nC5) and n-heptane (nC7) and the percentage of \n\ncarbon residue (CR). The most naphthenic studied crude has presented the lowest pour \n\npoint and the highest acid number. The authors justified the achieved correlation between \n\n1\nH NMR spectrum and the content of vanadium and nickel by the PLS method probably \n\ndue to the presence of paramagnetic metallic centers (for example vanadyl porphyrins). \n\nThese paramagnetic metallic centers in the molecules affect the chemical shifts of the \n\nentire \n1\nH NMR spectrum, the area of the spectrum of more distant protons and also the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n145 \n\n \n\nprotons belonging to the closest surrounding molecules. Consequently, their perturbation \n\nrange is extended further than the molecules containing metallic centers, influencing \n\ndifferent types of protons. Using the PLS regression method and the \n1\nH NMR spectra of \n\ndifferent crudes it was possible to meet the physical-chemical properties and the refining \n\nproduct yields with a high precision. \n\nNielsen et al. (2008) used multivariate models in the study of different heavy crude oil \n\nfractions, aiming to identify physical-chemical properties. The physical-chemical \n\nparameters analysed were the calculated carbon aromaticity index (CCAI), density at 15 \n\n\u00baC, gross (GCV) and net calorific values (NCV), viscosity at 50 \u00baC, ash content (ASH), \n\ntotal sediment accelerated (TSA), carbon residue (CR) plus aluminum, silicon, zinc and \n\nwater contents. The obtained results, especially of density, showed that high aromatic \n\ncontent is associated with a high density, while a high fraction of aliphatic compounds \n\nnormally has a lower density. A higher aromatic content means a higher value of \n\ncalculated carbon aromaticity index (CCAI) of the sample. Relatively to the GCV and \n\nNCV, which are very important parameters in the oil quality analysis, it was verified that \n\nthey have a positive contribution for the signals at 1.5, 0.7 and 0.5 ppm and a negative \n\ncontribution for the signal at 2.5 ppm in the \n1\nH NMR spectra. The MCR parameter, related \n\nwith the oil stability, can be determined in the \n1\nH NMR spectrum by the signals at 4.7-6.2 \n\nppm, having therefore a slighter contribution for the signals at 3.2-3.7 ppm and a negative \n\neffect for that at 1 ppm. The sulfur content can be determined by taking into account the \n\nregion between 2.1 and 3.0 ppm. The water content is predicted near 4.5 ppm for undiluted \n\nsamples and \n1\nH NMR measurements at 50 \u00baC. The combination of the PLS and PCA \n\ntechniques with the NMR spectroscopy have demonstrated, once again, to be very \n\nimportant in the analysis of physical-chemical properties on the heavy crude oil due to the \n\nfacility, fast and reliable way to obtain this type of information. \n\nPeinder et al. (2009) analysed the potential of PLS to predict some properties of crude oils, \n\nsuch as yield long-on-crude (YLC), density (D), viscosity (V), sulfur content (S), pour \n\npoint (PP), asphaltenes (Asph) and carbon residue (CR). The results obtained with the \n\nmultivariate analysis and the traditional methods, like the ASTM and IP, demonstrated the \n\nimportance of the PLS modelling that gave valuable and fast results. In this research, \n1\nH \n\nand \n13\n\nC NMR spectra and also other spectroscopic technique, the IR technique, were used, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n146 \n \n\nprimary to the analysis of each single technique and then associated, to determine the \n\nproperties previously described. It was verified that a single spectrum from different \n\ntechniques did not lead to any improvement in the results concerning the crude oil \n\nproperties. The combination of the two techniques did not present additional information \n\nonce the sample in the analysis was the same crude oil. However, each single spectrum \n\nwas modeled by PCA model and then compared with the results of the PLS models with \n\nthe single spectrum of each technique without the PCA method. With that it was concluded \n\nthat modelling PCA scores instead of all spectrum only contribute to a better results if the \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy was used. \n\nIn 1985, Kvalheim et al. (1985) used PCA to help in the NMR interpretation of the crude \n\noil naphtha fraction. The main idea was to analyse samples of the same geographical area \n\naiming to identify correlations between samples from the same source. Dependence \n\nbetween the samples, especially in the composition, was found, for example in long chain \n\nversus short chain alkanes, branching, cyclization, and aromatization. The main differences \n\nwere obtained in the quantities of the different structures. \n\nMasili et al. (2012) used \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy and PLS regression models to predict the \n\nproperties of 64 crude oil samples. The idea of such investigation was to develop a model \n\nthat contributed in a fast and low cost effective way to the characterization of the different \n\ncrude oils. Properties such as density, sulfur content, total acidity number, true boiling \n\npoint distillation yields and KUOP factor were determined using the ASTM standard \n\nmethods and were the properties predicted by the developed models. Successful results \n\nwere obtained when using the PLS models to predict such properties. \n\n \n\n5.2. Methods Applied in this Thesis \n\nAs the main objective of this research was the characterization of heavy residues and oil \n\nfractions such as fuel oil, HVGO and LVGO, using NMR spectroscopy, it was important to \n\nimplement statistical methods to correlate the NMR determinations with the physical-\n\nchemical properties used in the characterization of such products. After creating the data \n\nset for multivariate analysis, as referred in Chapter 4, the statistical methods for the \n\nanalysis of NMR spectral data could be applied. The statistical methods used, as shown in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n147 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1, were: i) Principal Component Regression (PCR) [based on principal \n\ncomponents analysis (PCA)]; ii) Partial Least Squares (PLS); and iii) Artificial Neural \n\nNetworks (ANN) [based on principal components analysis (PCA)]. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1: A flow chart of the different multivariate statistical methods used in this work. \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Principal Components Analysis - PCA \n\nPrincipal components analysis, also known as eigenanalysis or principal factor analysis \n\n(PFA), is a multivariate statistical method of data analysis applied in contexts where there \n\nare several variables collected in each observation (Miller et al., 2005). The idea is to \n\ntransform all these predictive variables into a reduced set of new variables called the \n\nprincipal components   ,   , \u2026,    (PCs). The principal components are linear \n\ncombinations of the original variables describing each specimen   ,   , \u2026,   . The first \n\nprincipal component,    (PC1), describes the first greatest variance and the second \n\nprincipal component,    (PC2), describes the second greatest, and so on, with the later \n\ncomponents describing the smallest variance. These principal components are orthogonal \n\nand uncorrelated with each other (Martens et al., 1989). They are calculated by linear \n\ncombinations of the original variables by means of the following equations: \n\nMultivariate Analysis \n\nPrincipal Component Analysis \n\nPrincipal Component Regression Artificial Neural Networks Partial Least Squares \n\nSample Classification  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n148 \n \n\n                             (5.1) \n\n                             (5.2) \n\n \n\nwith    ,    ,     representing the coefficients chosen with the aim to obtain new \n\nvariables that are not correlated with each other, unlike the original variables, and their \n\nvariance as large as possible. The principal components contain, in a much smaller number \n\nof variables, more than 90% of the information (cumulative percentage variance) that is \n\navailable in the original data set, meaning that these variables include the greatest \n\nvariability of the data and exclude the ones that contain modest information. \n\nGeometrically, the PCA is a rotation of the axes where the first principal component is in \n\nthe direction of maximum variation, the second greatest principal component in the \n\ndirection of the next greatest variation, and so on. With this, PCA reduces the data matrix \n\nfrom (   ) where   is the number of samples and   the number of data points per \n\nspectrum to a (   ) matrix with   representing the number of PCs determined. The \n\nsample coordinates on the new PC axes are called scores while the relationship between \n\nthe new and the original axes are referred as loadings. Consequently, the decomposition of \n\nthe data matrix occurs as indicated in Figure 5.2. With the scores it is possible to have \n\ninformation relative to the relation between samples variation (concentrations of \n\nmultivariate), while with loadings it is possible to have an idea about which region of the \n\nspectrum represent the highest variation, which means, a description about the PCs and its \n\nrelation with the original variables (chemical shifts) (Alam et al., 2004; Sousa et al., 2007; \n\nWinning et al., 2008; McKenzie et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2: Decomposition of the data matrix into scores, loadings and the residual (E). \n\ndata matrix \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n149 \n\n \n\nIt is important to have in attention that the principal components are not scale invariant, i.e. \n\nthey are dependent on the measurement scale in which the original variables are expressed \n\n(Miller et al., 2005). Consequently, it is important to analyse both the units used as well as \n\nthe range of values that the original variables assume and standardized the data before \n\napplying PCA, using the scaling methods as described in the Chapter 4. Once again, \n\nstandardizing the original variables     , by using the scaling methods, corresponds in \n\ncalculating the variable      values using the following expression: \n\n \n\n   \n     \n\n        \n (5.3) \n\n \n\nwhich, using the mean of each variable      and the variance      , transform all original \n\nvariables to have a zero mean and unit standard deviation. After applying this method, e.g. \n\nafter the standardization of the original data, the covariance matrix is determined. \n\nFollowing, the eigenvalues ( ; Equation 5.4) are determined by using the subsequent \n\nexpression: \n\n \n\n           (5.4) \n\n \n\nwhere   represents the identity matrix and     the covariance matrix. When the \n\nstandardization is used, the covariance matrix of the standardized data is equivalent to the \n\ncorrelation matrix of the original data. Using the Equation 5.5, the weights of the variables \n\nin the PCs are calculated (\u00c7amdev\u00fdren et al., 2005; Sousa et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n            (5.5) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n150 \n \n\nwhere   is the matrix of the weights (or eigenvectors). The principal components, in \n\nmathematical terms, are the eigenvectors of the matrix and to each principal component \n\n(eigenvector) corresponds an eigenvalue which indicates the amount of variance in the data \n\nset explained by the principal component (Miller et al., 2005). Using the original data set \n\nstandardized and the weights it is possible to obtain the principal components: \n\n \n\n        (5.6) \n\n \n\nThe number of principal components obtained is equal to the number of original variables \n\nused. However, the number of principal components used into further analysis is smaller \n\nthan the number of the original variables. The selection of the principal components used \n\nin further analysis depends on several criteria, which will be explained in the following \n\nsection. \n\nConcluding, PCA is used to reduce the amount of data for further visualization and \n\nanalysis. It helps in the interpretation of the process and in the identification of groups of \n\nvariables that are interrelated. This interrelation is not directly observed and is also useful \n\nto analyse which data is considered an outlier, i.e. samples with significant different \n\ncharacteristics when comparing with other samples (Alam et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2005; \n\nRezzi et al., 2005; Eriksson et al., 2006; Winning et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Principal Component Regression - PCR \n\nPrincipal component regression is a regression model that combines multiple linear \n\nregression (MLR) and principal component analysis (PCA) (Martens et al., 1989; Alam et \n\nal., 2004; Miller et al., 2005; Pires et al., 2008a), i.e. the spectral data is compressed by \n\nPCA and then a multiple linear regression is applied using as predictive variables the PCA \n\nscores. The variables  , from a linear combination, are substituted by a matrix of their PCs \n\nwhich are correlated with the output variable  . When comparing with PCA, PCR is \n\nanother method that can be used to reduce the number of predictor variables by using some \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n151 \n\n \n\nof the principal components instead of using all original variables. There are several \n\ncriteria that can be used to determine the number of principal components used in the \n\nregression analysis, such as: i) retain a sufficient number of principal components taking \n\ninto account the cumulative percentage variance (Alam et al., 2004), with a number of \n\ncomponents that explained more than 90% of the original data set; and ii) retain the \n\ncomponents whose eigenvalues are greater or equal to unit (Kaiser criterion) (\u00c7amdev\u00fdren \n\net al., 2005) once, like this, the variance of each principal component is always greater or \n\nequal to the variance of the original variable. In this work, these methods typically agree \n\non the number of components to retain, which is indifferent using either. The criteria \n\nmostly used is the one which selects PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1, and when this \n\ncriterion does not achieve 90% of the original data variance the other criterion must be \n\nused. In this way, it is ensure that the select PCs represented at least 90% of the original \n\ndata variance. The most important aspect to have in attention when choosing the \n\ncomponents is the amount of variation they explain of X (Martens et al., 1989; Miller et \n\nal., 2005). \n\n \n\n5.2.3. Partial Least Squares \u2013 PLS \n\nPartial least squares regression (PLSR) generates and combines characteristics from \n\nprincipal component regression (PCR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) to estimate \n\nthe subspace that best explains the variability in the relation between the response \n\nvariable      and predictor variables    . When using PCR, the principal components \n\nchosen explains the greatest amount of variance in  , independently of the strength of the \n\nrelationships between the predictors and the response variables. However, PLS finds a set \n\nof uncorrelated linear combinations of the predictor variables which, as happens in PCR, \n\nhave the highest capacity to explain the overall variability in the predictor variables but, \n\nmoreover, still are highly correlated with the response variables (Miller et al., 2005). \n\nNormally, PLS is preferred relatively to other traditional multivariate methods when there \n\nare smaller numbers of observations compared to the numbers of predictor variables, \n\nwhich is the reason that it is considered to be one of the least restrictive methods compared \n\nwith other multivariate extensions of the MLR models (Wold et al., 2001; Molina et al., \n\n2007). Besides this, it is also chosen in situations where only partial knowledge of the data \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n152 \n \n\nand multicollinearity among the explanatory variables exists (Eriksson et al., 2006). As \n\nalready stated, PLS has been designed to find the relation between the explanatory \n\nvariables     and the output variables     and searches a set of orthogonal components, \n\nthe latent variables, which performs a simultaneous decomposition of   and   with the \n\nconstraint that these components explain as much as possible the covariance between   \n\nand   (Wise et al., 1996; Abdi, 2003; McKenzie et al., 2011). The number of latent \n\nvariables depends on the correlation between these variables and the dependent variable, \n\nbut the main idea is to have the highest correlation and, if possible, with the smallest \n\nnumber of latent variables. If the number of latent variables is too small then there is not \n\nenough information to create the model and it will be a poor prediction. However, if the \n\nnumber of latent variables is higher, then there is too much variation and the model will \n\nnot be robust enough to small variations. There are different mathematical algorithms that \n\ncan be applied when using PLS as the PLS with cross validation (Keun et al., 2003; Molina \n\net al., 2007; Satya et al., 2007; Flumignan et al., 2012; Zerzucha et al., 2012) and with \n\nexternal validation. With these algorithms the idea is to determine the correct number of \n\nlatent variables which contributes to good predictions and small errors. Normally the cross \n\nvalidation is used when the number of samples is modest while the external validation is \n\nmore often used when a higher number of samples is presented. The best model, in the two \n\nalgorithms, is the one that presents a smaller error. In the cross validation the        \n\n(Root Mean Squared Error of Cross Validation) given by Equation 5.7 is calculated and in \n\nthe external validation the       (Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction) is calculated \n\nusing Equation 5.8. \n\n \n\n        \n             \n \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n(5.7) \n\n \n\n       \n             \n    \n   \n\n \n\n    \n (5.8) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n153 \n\n \n\nFor the external validation an independent validation data set is required and so      refers \n\nto the validation data set while, for the cross validation a data set encompassing the \n\ntraining and validation data sets, consequently,   refers to the number of samples of the \n\ntraining and validation data sets. This splitting of the data will be explained in Section 5.3.  \n\nThe complete procedure used when applying the PLS model can be defined as follows \n\n(Wise et al., 1996; Wold et al., 2001; Abdi, 2003; Pires et al., 2008b): \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n154 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3: A flow chart of the complete procedure used when applying the PLS model. \n\nNo? \n\nNo? 7.

Artificial Neural Networks \u2013 ANN \n\nThe artificial neural networks (ANN) are powerful mathematical models that can be used \n\nin the process control, in developing predictive models and in matching patterns (Fraser et \n\nal., 1997). They are considered as a tool to solve chemical problems having been already \n\napplied to spectroscopic analysis in the interpretation of mass spectral data (Curry et al., \n\n1990), infrared spectral analysis (Roggo et al., 2007) and nuclear \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC spectral \n\nanalysis (McKenzie et al., 2011). However, when comparing with the use of other \n\ntechniques such as PCA and PLS, ANN are not widely used in the interpretation of NMR \n\nspectroscopy data. To our knowledge, it has not yet been found in scientific literature the \n\nuse of ANN in the analysis of NMR spectral data of heavy petroleum fractions such as \n\nLVGO, HVGO and fuel oil. Related with petroleum refining industry, the ANN have been \n\nused in the prediction of distillate yields in a visbreaking process (Foddi et al., 2009), in \n\nthe prediction of diesel fuel cold properties (Marinovi? et al., 2012) and diesel fuel \n\nlubricity (Korres et al., 2002). \n\nIn a simple form, the ANN are learning models inspired in the biological neural processing \n\nsystem (Fraser et al., 1997; McKenzie et al., 2011) that attempt to mimic the operation of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n158 \n \n\nneurons in the brain trying to imitate the human brain\u2019s ability to learn. Therefore, ANN \n\ncan be considered as a processing unit that stores knowledge based on learning such as the \n\nhuman brain. The human brain is able to learn and make decisions based on human \n\nlearning that results from human interaction with their surroundings.  \n\nThe fundamental elements that characterize the ANN models are: i) the neurons or also \n\nknown as nodes; ii) a pattern of connectivity among neurons; iii) an activation function for \n\neach neuron; and iv) a learning algorithm (Ahmadloo et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). All \n\nprocessing nodes that forms the ANN are interconnected by synapses in a net like \n\nstructure, operate in parallel, communicating with each other by means of connecting \n\nweights (Wang et al., 2010) and are distributed by several layers (input layer, output layer \n\nand hidden layers) (Miller et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007; Roggo et al., 2007), as shown in \n\nFigure 5.4. The structure of the network that is defined by the nodes and the way that they \n\nare linked can be divided into two of the most common types: i) feedforward networks; \n\nand ii) recurrent networks (Fraser et al., 1997; Maier et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). The \n\nfeedforward networks are characterized for only present connections starting in inputs \n\nnodes and ending in outputs nodes and for not having connections starting in outputs of \n\nnodes and ending in inputs of nodes in the same layer or previous layer. In these cases, the \n\ninformation flows only feedforward from input to output nodes and never feedback. On the \n\nother hand, when the networks present the two types of connections, the feedforward and \n\nthe feedback, the neural network architecture is designated by recurrent network. From \n\nthese two, the feedforward is the most applied in the real world applications and normally \n\nis characterized from having an output layer, not many hidden layers (one or two hidden \n\nlayers will be preferred) and an input layer. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n159 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4: Example of a feedforward artificial neural network. \n\n \n\nThe learning process of the ANN is progressive and depends on the variability of the input \n\ndata, and on the linkages that is established between nodes to obtain the output \n\ninformation. In the linkages established between nodes, also called synapses, there are \n\nvalues assigned that are defined as the weights. These weights are very important and \n\nconsidered adjustable parameters that are responsible by the neural structure and have the \n\nability of learn and keep the information given on memory. It is important that the \n\ninformation received by the artificial neural network is descriptive about the physical \n\nphenomenon to allow that the ANN extracts the best relationship between the inputs and \n\nthe desired outputs. There are three types of learning algorithms used in artificial neural \n\nnetworks: i) unsupervised learning; ii) reinforcement learning; and iii) supervised learning. \n\nIn the first one, during the training of the artificial neural network, the response desired is \n\nnot given. In the reinforcement learning and during the training of the neural network only \n\na reward response is given. In the last one, the supervised learning, during the training the \n\ndesired response is given to the ANN (Fraser et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2010). From all \n\nthese learning algorithms, the most commonly used is supervised learning. As stated \n\nearlier, in the supervised learning a set of input-output pairs are given to the ANN. The \n\ndata received by the input is then propagated to output passing through the \n\ninterconnections between neurons. The neurons are responsible for processing the \n\n    \n\nInputs Outputs \n\nInput Layer \n\nOutput Layer \n\nHidden Layer \n\nExternal Input \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n160 \n \n\ninformation received by the inputs and calculating the output. There are some activated \n\nfunctions associated to the artificial neuron that are used to obtain the output. The most \n\ncommon functions are: i) the pure linear; ii) the sigmoid; and iii) the hyperbolic tangent \n\n(Marques, 1999; Hern\u00e1ndez-Caraballo et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2007). The general working \n\nprinciple of the artificial neuron and the way to obtain the output of node   (  ) can be \n\ndemonstrated by means of the following expression: \n\n \n\n               \n\n \n\n   \n\n  (5.20) \n\n \n\nwhere     is the activation function,    the input value from the previous node  ,     the \n\nweight value that connects node   and node  ,    the bias value of node   and   the total \n\nnumber of previous nodes connecting with node  . The network continues to correlate the \n\ninputs and outputs to find the best weights and bias that minimize the output error, which is \n\nacquired when comparing the predicted output of the ANN with the actual output value. \n\nThis process is called the training procedure and it is repetitively applied in an iterative \n\nprocess until the bias values and weights are adjusted to reduce the global error (Kapur et \n\nal., 2004; Liu et al., 2007). To train the ANN a learning rule must be implemented and the \n\nmost popular in the ANN is the back-propagation algorithm (Liu et al., 2007). The back-\n\npropagation algorithms has different variants being the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm \n\none of the most widely used (Chaloulakou et al., 2003; Motlaghi et al., 2008). As some \n\nauthors (Chaloulakou et al., 2003) announced, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm \n\ncompared with the original back-propagation algorithm has showed significantly faster \n\nconvergence and has been proved to be accurate enough in most cases. The main idea of \n\nusing these algorithms is to minimize the error between the predicted and the observed \n\noutput values and so the error of the output neurons is back propagated through the \n\nnetwork to adjust the weights and bias values during the training period (Gershenson, \n\n2003; Motlaghi et al., 2008; Mashrei et al., 2010).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n161 \n\n \n\nDuring the training procedure it is possible to find some overfitting problems (Kapur et al., \n\n2004). Overfitting indicates that the artificial neural network models memorize the training \n\nexamples and have not learnt the ability to generalize, consequently the application of the \n\nneural network models to new situations can lead to higher errors. The same doesn\u2019t occur \n\nwith the values used to train the network, since the error is reduced due to the high number \n\nof iterations applied to obtain the best network. To overcome the overfitting problem and \n\nto improve the generalization of the network the available data is divided into three data \n\nsets, the training set, the validation set and the test set (Chaloulakou et al., 2003; Maier et \n\nal., 2010). The training data set is the only one used to develop the ANN models and to \n\ndetermine the network weights and bias values by solving a non-linear optimization \n\nproblem. The validation data set is important to examine the accuracy of the ANN during \n\nthe training set and plays a role of preventing overfitting on the training set. At the end of \n\neach training iteration the mean squared error       is determined (see Equation 5.21) by \n\ncross-validation for the training and validation data sets simultaneously. Normally, the \n\nerrors on both data sets decreases as the proceeding of the training processes, although \n\nwhen the ANN begins to overfit, the error on the validation data set starts to increase while \n\nthe error of the training data set progress decreasing (Mi et al., 2005). The continuous \n\nincreasing of the error on the validation data set, for a specified number of iterations, stops \n\nthe training processes. The best network parameters corresponds to an ANN which \n\npresents a minimum global value of     for the validation and training data sets and \n\ngenerally a high number of attempts is performed. This ANN presenting the minimum \n\nglobal value of     for the validation and training data sets will have a better \n\ngeneralization. The    , used as the performance function to interpret the difference \n\nbetween the predicted output value of the ANN and the observed output value, is \n\ndetermined by means of the following equation:  \n\n \n\n    \n \n\n \n          \n\n \n \n\n   \n\n (5.21) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n162 \n \n\nwhere    represents the observed values,     the modeled ones and   the number of samples \n\nfrom the data set. The test data set, never used for the training of the ANN, is used as a \n\nfinal test to analyse the trained ANN performance using another different set of samples \n\n(Kapur et al., 2004; Ahmadloo et al., 2010).  \n\nThe main steps used in the development of ANN prediction models are resumed in Figure \n\n5.5 (Maier et al., 2010): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5: Steps used in the development of an ANN prediction models. \n\n \n\n1. Choice of potential inputs and outputs \u2013 using a priori knowledge and/or availability \n\nof data, the modeller should be able to select a set of potential model input variables from \n\nthe available data. It is important to select the right pairs of input-output data that is going \n\nto be used in the develop of the best possible model (Maier et al., 2010); \n\n \n\n1.

Data processing \u2013 consists in the preparation of the data to subsequent steps of the \n\nmodel development process. Standardization and scaling are examples of data processing \n\nthat can be applied. In this study, as already mentioned in Chapter 4, all input variables \n\n(NMR spectra) have undergone a pre-treatment;  \n\n \n\n3. Selection of inputs \u2013 the selection of the appropriate set of inputs is determinative in the \n\nANN process. The idea is not having too many or too few inputs. If too many inputs are \n\nused, it is possible that some of them are related with each other and so redundant \n\ninformation or even no additional information is given to the model, which can contribute \n\nto overfitting and to identical model performance. While when using too few inputs it is \n\npossible that some of the inputs that have significant information are excluded and so the \n\navailable data is not enough in the development of the resulting model. In this study, the \n\nprincipal components obtained after the application of PCA were used as inputs of the \n\nnetwork. The use of principal components will contribute to simplify the network \n\narchitecture due to the decrease of input variables, trying also to mitigate overfitting \n\nproblems in the ANN model (Warne et al., 2004; Sousa et al., 2007; Maier et al., 2010); \n\n \n\n4. Division of the data \u2013 as stated earlier, the data is divided into training, validation and \n\ntest data sets. These different data sets must be representative of all information available;  \n\n \n\n5. Selection of model architecture \u2013 as stated before, the network architecture gives \n\nimportant information about the overall network structure and indicates how the \n\ninformation flows in ANN models. It depends on the number of layers, the number of \n\nnodes and how they are linked with each other. The number of nodes in the input and \n\noutput layers are determined by the nature of the problem while the optimum number of \n\nnodes in the hidden layer can be determined by trial and error. The most commonly ANN \n\narchitectures used are the feedforward and recurrent networks (Maier et al., 2010);  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n164 \n \n\n6. Optimization of hidden nodes and model parameters \u2013 for such optimization it is \n\nimportant to have in account: i) the structure of the network as the number of hidden nodes \n\nand the activation functions; ii) the model network parameters, as weights and bias values; \n\nand iii) the performance evaluation of the model. Following an iterative process of training \n\nand evaluation steps, the best model structure, which represents the desired input/output \n\nrelationship, is obtained. With this iterative process the goal is to search a combination of \n\nmodel parameters (weights and bias values) that minimizes the output error between \n\npredicted and observed output values; \n\n \n\n7. Validation of the model \u2013 after identifying the best network configuration, to validate \n\nthe model it is necessary to verify its performance when using an independent data set, the \n\ntest data set. In this study, the best network configuration corresponds to an ANN which \n\npresents a minimum global value of     for the validation and training data sets, after the \n\nnetwork being trained during one thousands of attempts with different initial values for \n\nweights and bias. The best network obtained has a better generalization and its \n\nperformance is evaluated calculating some statistical performance indexes (Maier et al., \n\n2010). The statistical parameters used in this work are presented in Section 5.4.  \n\n \n\n5.3. Models Pre-Treatment \n\nThis study aims to evaluate the performance of the statistical models described above \n\n(PCR, PLS and ANN) for predicting the crude oil fractions properties from NMR. The data \n\nobtained with the NMR spectroscopy was used as the predictors\u2019 variables (X) of the \n\nmodels, while the physical-chemical properties determined using the ASTM and IP \n\nstandards methods were used as outputs of the models (y). For the development of the \n\nmodels, the data was divided into different groups: training, validation and test data sets, in \n\nthe ratio of 60%, 20% and 20%, respectively. All different data sets were representatives of \n\nthe data available. For the PCR model and PLS model with cross validation the samples \n\nforming the training and validation data sets were grouped (Figure 5.6) while for the ANN \n\nmodel, as visualized in Figure 5.7, a separate validation data set was required. The training \n\ndata set, the largest one, was used to set up the model and to determine the models \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n165 \n\n \n\nparameters, while the test data set was inevitable for evaluating the models performance \n\nwhen applied to a new data set. The validation data set was used to find the optimal \n\ndimensionality of the multivariate model, avoiding either overfitting or underfitting. The \n\nsplitting of the data is a very important procedure for models that are aimed for \n\napplications in the routine processes control since it is necessary to perform a model that \n\nwill be applicable to the overall data set and to new samples. If the splitting of the data was \n\nnot made, e.g. if using all samples at the training data set, the developed model would \n\nbecame very dependent on the data and when applied to a new data set it probably would \n\nnot respond with a good accuracy and precision leading to large prediction errors. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6: Schematic representation of variable selection for the PCR model and PLS model with cross validation. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7: Schematic representation of variable selection for the and ANN models.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n166 \n \n\nThe split of the original data has been performed using the percentile distribution. Using \n\nthe percentile distribution the objective was to divide the data into three sets covering \n\napproximately the same region and having similar statistical properties. The percentile was \n\ndetermined applying the percentile function in the range of the corresponding data set for \n\nvalues of percentile between 0.01 to 0.99. Taking into consideration the percentile \n\ndistribution determined, the original data was randomly selected and allocated to the \n\ndifferent data sets. Hence, it was guaranteed the representative of the original data in three \n\ndata sets. The results obtained using the percentile distribution to create the different data \n\nsets were similar with the results obtained by applying a different algorithm based on \n\nworks performed by Snee and Fern\u00e1ndez Pierna et al. (Snee, 1977; Fern\u00e1ndez Pierna et al., \n\n2009) for selecting the different data sets. Their algorithm was based on the Euclidean \n\ndistance between all possible pairs of inputs points. Hence, in this work the Euclidean \n\ndistance between two input vector (input data obtained by NMR spectroscopy of the \n\nsample   and  , for example) for a given physical-chemical property ( ) was calculated by \n\nusing the following expression: \n\n \n\n               \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n (5.22) \n\n \n\nwith   representing all the samples analysed for a given physical-chemical property and     \n\nindicating the  th sample analysed of the input data obtained by NMR spectroscopy for the \n\nphysical-chemical property determined ( ). The procedure consisted in determining the \n\ndistance between all input vectors and then selecting the two vectors which were furthest \n\naway from each other. These vectors were assigned for the training data set. Subsequently, \n\nafter removing the two vectors for the training data set, from the remaining vectors, the \n\nother two vectors which were farthest away from each other were selected for the grouped \n\nvalidation and test data set. The procedure continued to be applied until all vectors from \n\nthe original data were added alternately to each set, the training data set and the validation \n\nand test data sets. Afterward, the same procedure was performed to the grouped validation \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n167 \n\n \n\nand test data set in order to generate the two new data sets, the validation data set and test \n\ndata set. In this stage of the analysis, the training data set was composed by 50% of the \n\noriginal data while the validation and test data sets were formed by 25% of the original \n\ndata set, respectively. Since the results obtained with this algorithm were very similar to \n\nthe ones achieved by the percentile distribution it was considered that both approaches \n\ncould be applied. For this reason, the percentile distribution was the selected method to be \n\nused to create the different data sets.  \n\nWhen using the PCR method, the principal components obtained in the PCA, were used as \n\ninputs of the model and the physical-chemical properties analysed were used as outputs. To \n\ndetermine the number of principal components to be used in this regression analysis, the \n\ncriteria indicated to retain the components whose eigenvalues were greater or equal to the \n\nunit, was used (Kaiser criterion), although, from all principal components only the ones \n\nwith statistically significance were required. With this, it was guaranteed that the \n\ncomponents which had important contributions from the original variables were included \n\nin the model. In this algorithm the training data set include 80% of the original data while \n\nthe test data set comprised 20% of the original data. Meaning that in the PCR model the \n\ntraining data set (80%) encompassed the samples forming the training data set (60%) and \n\nthe ones from the validation data set (20%), after the separation in the three different \n\ngroups by the percentile distribution. \n\nWhen using PLS, the cross-validation and the external validation method were test to \n\ndetermine the number of latent variables. However, once the results obtained using cross-\n\nvalidation were always better than the ones obtained with external validation, the last \n\nmethod was no longer used. The number of latent variables, estimated using the cross-\n\nvalidation algorithm, was selected by determining the minimum of the mean squared error \n\n(      ), given by Equation 5.7, considering a wide range of latent variables. With this \n\nalgorithm an iterative procedure was used where one vector was put aside at each step and \n\nthe response values for the vector that had been left out was determined and the resulting \n\nerror of prediction estimated. Thereby, the mean squared error was calculated from n \n\nmultiple partial regressions, where in each regression the number of input vectors used to \n\ndetermined the regression parameters was n-1, while the other vector was used in the \n\nprediction of the error. This procedure was carried out until all the input vectors were used \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n168 \n \n\nonly once in the estimation of the error. The value n was assigned to the number of input \n\nvectors of the training and validation data sets. The input variables of the PLS model were \n\nthe NMR spectra and the properties of the samples the output variables.  \n\nFor the ANN method, the principal components were used as input variables while the \n\npredicted properties were used as outputs. The networks used were of the feedforward \n\nartificial neural network type. These networks were characterized for having three types of \n\nlayers (the input, the hidden and the output layer) and were tested using two, three and four \n\nnodes in the hidden layer. The best results were obtained when three nodes in the hidden \n\nlayer were used. More than four nodes in the hidden layer were not considered as it can \n\narrive to networks with a higher number of parameters compared with the dimension of \n\ndata available. The transfer function used to obtain the output value was the hyperbolic \n\ntangent at the hidden layer node and the linear in the output layer node. The best network \n\nobtained corresponded to the ANN that presented a minimum global value of     \n\n(Equation 5.21) for the training and validation data sets, after the network had been trained \n\nduring one thousands of attempts with different initial values for weights and bias. Hence, \n\nthe training data set was used to determine the network weights and bias, while the \n\nvalidation data set was applied to evaluate the performance of the network during the \n\ntraining data set. The test data set was used to evaluate the performance of the obtained \n\nANN in different situations than those used in the training of the ANN. \n\nAll models used were developed in Visual Basic\n\u00ae\n for Applications develop for Microsoft \n\nExcel\n\u00ae\n and in Matlab\n\n\u00ae\n 2011a (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) using available models \n\nof principal component analysis, principal component regression, partial least squares and \n\nartificial neural networks.  \n\n \n\n5.4. Performance Indexes \n\nTo evaluate the model\u2019s performance in both training and validation data sets and test data \n\nset there were some statistical parameters (see Table 5.1) that were calculated, such as the: \n\ni) coefficient of determination    ; Equation 5.23) or the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (   ; \n\nEquation 5.24); ii) mean absolute error (   ; Equation 5.25); iii) the root mean squared \n\nerror (    ; Equation 5.26); iv) mean bias error (   ; Equation 5.27); v) percent bias \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nPREDICTION USING MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS \n \n\n169 \n\n \n\n(      ; Equation 5.28); and vi)     -observations standard deviation ratio (    ; \n\nEquation 5.29). These statistical parameters analysed can be divided in different major \n\ncategories: i) standard regression; ii) dimensionless; and iii) error index. The standard \n\nregression statistics, which included the coefficient of determination, determine the \n\nstrength of the linear relationship between the predicted and observed data (Moriasi et al., \n\n2007). The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency       is an example of dimensionless techniques, \n\nwhich provide a relative model evaluation between the residual variance (\u201cnoise\u201d) \n\ncompared to the measured data variance (\u201cinformation\u201d). Moreover, it indicates how well \n\nthe plot of observed versus measured data fits the 1:1 line (Legates et al., 1999; Hall, 2001; \n\nMoriasi et al., 2007). The     statistical parameter, introduced by Nash and Sutcliffe \n\n(1970), is analogous with the coefficient of determination      and, in this case, where \n\nboth determined by using the same expression, as visualized in Table 5.1. Although these \n\nstatistical parameters were determined in the same way, it was considered important to \n\ndetermine both for model evaluation. The tendency is to use the coefficient of \n\ndetermination as a first way to evaluate how much of the observed dispersion is explained \n\nby the prediction. However, it should not be used alone when model evaluation is required \n\nand therefore, other statistical parameters are necessary to evaluate the relationship \n\nbetween measured and predicted properties. Since the general performance ratings \n\npresented by Moriasi et al. (2007) were used in this work, the     statistical parameter \n\nwas also determined. Besides the standard regression and dimensionless categories, the \n\nerror indices measure the deviation between the predicted and experimental data. Examples \n\nof error indices are the mean absolute error      , mean bias error      , root mean \n\nsquared error       , percent bias        , and the     -observations standard \n\ndeviation ratio      . \n\nTo evaluate each model performance, all the statistical parameters indicated in Table 5.1 \n\nwere determined. However, since the general performance ratings presented by Moriasi et \n\nal. (2007) were based on the    ,     and       results, only these statistical parameters, \n\nin addition to the reported performance ratings presented in Table 5.2, were used to \n\nclassify the developed models. In this way, taking in consideration the    ,     and \n\n      results, the developed models can be evaluated, compared and classified as very \n\ngood, good, satisfactory and unsatisfactory. These general performance ratings \n\nrecommended by Moriasi et al. (2007) (Table 5.2) were defined to compare simulated \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n \n\n170 \n \n\noutput with measure data and consequently used to establish a platform for model \n\nevaluation. The idea of Moriasi et al. (2007) research was to demonstrate that the \n\ncombination of graphical techniques and dimensionless and error index statistics should be \n\nused for model evaluation. Consequently, the quantitative statistics    ,       and     \n\nwere recommended as well as its performance ratings. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5.1: The statistical parameters analysed. \n\nStatistical Parameters Expression Definition  \n\nCoefficient of Determination \n\n      \n  \n\n         \n           \n\n  \n   \n\n \n   \n\n         \n  \n\n   \n\n \n\nWith the coefficient of determination it is possible \n\nto have an idea about the variability of the results \n\nreproduced by the development model when \n\ncompared with the observed data.

Data \n\nAs already stated in a previous chapter, the monitoring samples considered in this study \n\nwere fuel oil, HVGO and LVGO. Their physical-chemical properties were determined at \n\nthe laboratory of Matosinhos refinery while the NMR spectra of such samples were \n\ndetermined with a laboratory spectrometer at the University of Aveiro. At the beginning of \n\nthe project, \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy were used to evaluate the performance of each \n\ntechnique in predicting the physical-chemical properties of the samples in study. \n\nInformation about the number of the first samples analysed by each technique and their \n\nproperties is shown in Table 6.1. However, the analysis of each sample using both, \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy, has not always been applied. As set out in further detail below, \n\nthere are some limitations associated with one of these techniques. A brief description of \n\nthe results obtained using \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy techniques is presented. Finally, a \n\ndetailed analysis of the results for predicting physical-chemical properties of the three \n\ndifferent streams is presented. \n\n \n\nTable 6.1: Number of samples analysed by \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy and minimum and maximum values of the \n\nproperties analysed by the standard methods. \n\nsamples properties \nnumber of samples \n\nanalysed \n\nproperties results \n\nminimum maximum \n\nFuel Oil \nKinematic viscosity 100 \u00baC (cSt) 32 20.76 68.34 \n\nDensity (g/mL) 32 0.9665 0.9911 \n\n \n\n \n\n6.1.1. \n13\n\n C NMR Spectroscopy \n\nFigure 6.1 presents some of the quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectra obtained with the analysis of \n\nthe fuel oil samples. By observation of the spectra it is possible to visualize that between \n\n70 and 90 ppm no important information about the composition of the sample occurs, i.e., \n\nno important signals appears in this region. Consequently, this region was omitted to avoid \n\nincluding the solvent signal into the models. Hence, the spectral region considered in the \n\ndeveloped models only included the signals between 11 and 60 ppm and between 100 and \n\n160 ppm.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n178 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1: Quantitative\n 13\n\nC NMR spectra of some fuel oil samples. \n\n \n\nFor the development of the models all 32 samples of fuel oil were used. From which, 12 \n\nsamples constituted the training data set while the validation and test data sets were \n\nrepresented by 10 samples, respectively. The bin width (division of the spectrum in \n\nspecified segments) used was 0.5 ppm instead of 0.02 ppm. In the case of quantitative \n13\n\nC \n\nNMR, it was impossible to use a bin of 0.02 ppm, due to the large chemical shift of the \n\nquantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum. If using a bin of 0.02 ppm, 21 PCs (principal components) \n\nwere select. The results obtained when using quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR and the multivariate \n\nmodels (PCR, PLS and ANN) are presented in Table 6.2. \n\nBefore applied PCR and ANN models, PCA was implemented. PCA was used as a \n\nclassification method to reduce the number of variables in the models by selecting only the \n\nprincipal components with eigenvalues greater than or equal to 1. In this study, the PCs \n\nwith eigenvalues greater than or equal to 1 incorporate more than 90% of the original data \n\nvariance. These results were very important once it indicated that the PCs chosen contained \n\nsignificant information about the original variables and increased the confidence in the \n\nPCA results. Results presented in Table 6.2 shows that 17 PCs were used for predicting \n\nkinematic viscosity (cSt). The percentage of the original data variance contained in the \n\nselected PCs was 96.6%. For predicting density (g/mL), 17 PCs corresponding to 96.4% of \n\nthe original data variance were required. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.2: Results obtained for different properties of fuel oil analysed when using quantitative\n 13\n\nC NMR in multivariate models. \n\n   \nbin \n\nnumber \n\nPC \n\nnumber \n\nLV \n\nnumber \n\nnodes \n\ntotal \n\nvariance \n                               \n\nmodel \n\nperformance \n\nKinematic \n\nviscosity \n\n100 \u00baC \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n0.5 \n\n17 \n\n  \n\n96.6% \n\n0.26 7.06 8.96 0.00 0.00 0.86 unsatisfactory \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.36 6.14 8.32 -1.60 -4.47 0.80 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n 3 \n0.63 4.72 6.29 0.52 1.45 0.61 satisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.52 5.51 7.18 -2.22 -6.20 0.69 satisfactory \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 5   \n0.99 0.65 0.79 0.00 0.00 0.08 very good \n\ntest \n   \n\n0.22 6.47 9.13 -1.50 -4.19 0.88 unsatisfactory \n\nDensity  \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n0.5 \n\n17 \n\n  \n\n96.4% \n\n0.31 0.004 0.005 0.00 0.00 0.83 unsatisfactory \n\ntest \n  \n\n-0.24 0.005 0.006 0.00 0.01 1.11 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n 3 \n0.80 0.002 0.002 -0.001 -0.06 0.45 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.67 0.002 0.003 0.00 0.01 0.58 good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 3   \n0.84 0.002 0.002 0.00 0.00 0.40 very good \n\ntest \n   \n\n0.50 0.003 0.004 0.00 0.04 0.71 unsatisfactory \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n180 \n \n\nThe final models were obtained and the performance of the developed models (PCR, PLS \n\nand ANN) considering the training and validation data sets and the test data set evaluated \n\nthrough the determination of the performance indexes as referred in Chapter 5. When \n\npredicting fuel oil kinematic viscosity, very good performance indexes in the training and \n\nvalidation data sets using the PLS model with five latent variables were obtained, as \n\nvisualized in Table 6.2. The model did not predict the values of the test data set. In a way \n\nto understand this behaviour, a very good prediction obtained at the training and validation \n\ndata sets and an unsatisfactory prediction at the test data set, the data sets were modified to \n\nverify if no mistakes during the selection of the samples for each data set occurred. As \n\nexpected, since each data set was representative of the original data and equally spread in \n\nvariance, the same behaviour occurred, e.g. the model did not predict the values of the test \n\ndata set independently of the selected samples composing the test data set. This lead as to \n\nconclude that the obtained performance indexes were not dependent on the choice of the \n\nsamples forming each data set, but on the model applied and the number of samples \n\ncomposing the data sets, as better predictions, than the ones achieved with the PLS and \n\nPCR models, were obtained, at the test data set, when applying the ANN model. \n\nComparing with PCR and PLS, it was possible to visualize that ANN model presented \n\nhigher     value and smaller     result, when analysing the test data set. Furthermore, it \n\nwas possible to verify that it was with the ANN model that a smaller      value was \n\nobtained at the test data set. The     and       were negative for the test data set \n\npredicted with the ANN model, meaning that, in average, the predict kinematic viscosity of \n\nfuel oil samples was underestimated. For the training and validation data sets, the results \n\nobtained were not as good as the ones obtained with the PLS model. Nevertheless, it was \n\nwith the ANN model that similar predictive results were obtained for both data sets. Using \n\nthe general performance ratings developed by Moriasi et al. (2007), the results obtained by \n\nthe ANN model were classified as satisfactory in all data sets. Accordingly, the results \n\nshowed that the best model to predict the kinematic viscosity of fuel oil samples using \n\nquantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy was obtained with ANN model.  \n\nAnalysing the results obtained for the prediction of fuel oil density (Table 6.2) it was \n\npossible to conclude that the worst performance occurred with PCR model, where \n\nunsatisfactory predictions for both data sets were obtained. Concerning the results obtained \n\nwith the PLS model, it was verified that very good predictions at the training and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n181 \n\n \n\nvalidation data sets were obtained, however, when predicting the test data set \n\nunsatisfactory results were achieved. When applying the ANN model, very good \n\npredictions at the training and validation data sets were obtained, although for the test data \n\nset only a good model was achieved. Once again, the ANN was the model that gave the \n\nbest results in both data sets. High     value and small     results were indicatives of a \n\ngood model. Additionally,      and     presented low values indicating that the \n\ndifference between the predicted and observed density values was very small. For the \n\ntraining and validation data sets and for the test data set, the prediction of the density \n\nvalues was overestimated. \n\nComing back to Table 6.2, it was clear that the use of the ANN model lead to more \n\naccurate results, compared to the other models in predicting the kinematic viscosity and \n\ndensity of fuel oil samples by using quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy. However, to \n\nimprove the results obtained and the accuracy of the developed models more fuel oil \n\nsamples should be included in the both data sets.  \n\n \n\n6.1.2. \n1\nH NMR Spectroscopy \n\nWith respect to experimental results, the \n1\nH NMR spectra of several fuel oil samples are \n\npresented in Figure 6.2. Even though the \n1\nH NMR spectrum of fuel oil is very crowded and \n\nhighly overlapped it is possible to assign distinct structural regions to different functional \n\ngroups. The region between 0.5 to 4.5 ppm originates the aliphatic region, where it is \n\npossible to identify the aliphatic CH3 groups at 0.5 to 1.0 ppm, while the aromatic region \n\nspans from 6.5 to 10.0 ppm. From these regions some chemical shifts were eliminated to \n\ncreate the appropriate data for posterior application of the models. The data set comprises \n\nthe chemical shift region between 0.5 to 4.5 ppm, 6.5 to 7.1 ppm and 7.4 to 10.0 ppm. \n\nWhile the solvent signal (7.1 to 7.4 ppm) and the regions where no important information \n\noccurred and were spectral signatures of additives or other chemical species appears (4.5 to \n\n6.4 ppm) were avoided. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n182 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2: \n1\nH NMR spectra of some fuel oil samples. \n\n \n\nThe 32 fuel oil samples analysed with quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy were also the \n\nsamples analysed by \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy, to compare the results of both techniques. \n\nPrior to multivariate modelling, the 32 fuel oil samples constituting the data set were \n\ndivided in three different sets, the training data set containing 12 fuel oil samples, the \n\nvalidation data set comprising 10 samples and the test data set containing 10 samples. The \n\nspectral area used was divided in constant segments of 0.02 ppm, since the bin width of \n\n0.02 ppm procedure was preferred over other segments. Moreover, the whole procedure \n\nused to apply the multivariate models was the same as the one performed when using the \n\nquantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectra.

The selection of the number of PCs was made taking into \n\naccount the Kaiser criterion as referred in Section 5.2.2 and, as previously mentioned, also \n\nconsidering the total variance obtained when using the quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy. \n\nComing back to Table 6.3, independently of the model applied, very good predictions of \n\nfuel oil kinematic viscosity were obtained for the training and validation data sets. High \n\n    results, small      and     values, and small     results characterized all \n\ndeveloped models achieved for the training and validation data sets. However, for the test \n\ndata set, the predictions obtained with the applied models were not as good as the ones \n\nachieved for the training and validation data sets. As visualized in Table 6.3, the PCR \n\nmodel presented unsatisfactory performance indexes with low quality results, as small     \n\nresult and very high      value. The PLS model also indicated that the results obtained \n\nwhen predicting the kinematic viscosity of fuel oil were not accurate. In this case, only \n\nsatisfactory predictions were performed by the model. Even changing the number of latent \n\nvariables, it was not possible to improve the PLS results. When the ANN model was \n\napplied, better performance indexes were obtained, showing that the develop model was of \n\nhigher quality. This model, obtained when using 3 nodes in the hidden layer, was \n\ncharacterized for having higher     result, small      and     values, and small     \n\nvalue, comparing with the ones obtained with the PCR and PLS models. \n\nFor the density predictions of the fuel oil samples, the results obtained during training and \n\nvalidation data sets and test data set using PLS and ANN models demonstrated that \n\naccurate models were achieved. It was observed in Table 6.3 that very good performance \n\nindexes were obtained for both data sets when both models, PLS and ANN models, were \n\napplied. Only the PCR model presented a significant difference, since worse predictions \n\nwere obtained for both data sets, training and validation data sets and test data set. The \n\npredictions obtained with the PCR model at the training and validation data sets presented \n\nreasonable results, with a satisfactory model achieved; however, the performance indexes \n\nfor the test data set were slightly worse than for the training and validation data sets. For \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n185 \n\n \n\nthe PCR and ANN model, 7 PCs were used, explaining 96.6% of the total variance and 3 \n\nnodes at the hidden layer of the ANN model where needed. The prediction with PLS model \n\nwas performed using 8 latent variables.  \n\nConcluding, the ANN and PLS models were preferred over PCR model to predict the \n\nproperties of the fuel oil samples by using \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy. The performance \n\nindexes indicated that the developed models were of higher quality when using the ANN \n\nmodel to predict the fuel oil kinematic viscosity. Relatively to the prediction of the fuel oil \n\ndensity, similar performance indexes than the ones achieved with the PLS model where \n\nobtained when using the ANN model. In general, higher coefficient of determination \n\nbetween the predicted and measured data and smaller residual variations were achieved \n\nwhen using the ANN model to predict both properties analysed. The ANN model \n\ndemonstrated to be a very important method having the capability to construct very good \n\nmodels between the measured data and the predicted properties, due to their ability to learn \n\ncomplex non-linear and multivariate relationships between process parameters.  \n\n \n\n6.1.3. \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR Spectroscopy \n\nComparing the results presented above, it was possible to conclude that both techniques, \n\n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy, combined with multivariate statistical methods could give \n\ngood predictions of the proprieties of fuel oil samples. In addition, it was demonstrated that \n\nboth techniques could be used to predict the kinematic viscosity at 100 \u00baC and the density \n\nof fuel oil samples instead of the traditional ASTM methods in laboratory applications. \n\nHowever, when the idea was to evaluate the possibility of using an industrial application of \n\nNMR spectroscopy, to predict the proprieties of different samples, quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR \n\nspectroscopy was not a good choice. Besides the good results, especially when predicting \n\nfuel oil density, the main problem associated with this technique was related to the time \n\nrequired to obtain a quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum of such complex samples as petroleum \n\nfractions. It was necessary eight hours to obtain a quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum of a fuel \n\noil sample. With less than eight hours it was not possible to obtain a good spectrum, with a \n\ngood signal resolution and an adequate signal to noise ratio. The time required to acquire \n\nthis spectrum was very high and even a standard ASTM method could be faster (see Table \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n186 \n \n\n4.2, page 126). Besides the time, the preparation of a quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR sample could \n\nalso be a restriction. As referred previously, to obtain a quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum a \n\nparamagnetic relaxation reagent as Cr(acac)3 was required. Cr(acac)3 was difficult to \n\ndissolve in fuel oil samples requiring higher amounts of the solvent (CDCl3). Additionally, \n\nto guarantee that a perfect homogeneous solution and all Cr(acac)3 was dissolved it was \n\nnecessary to use the ultrasonic bath. Due to these facts and the difficulty associated with \n\nthe use of the paramagnetic relaxation reagent it is not guaranteed that a perfect solution is \n\nobtainable at an online sample preparation.  \n\nThe main objective when evaluating the use of an online NMR spectrometer is to verify if \n\nits implementation will improve and lead to a better control over the streams and lead to \n\nachieve optimal operations and profitability in real time. Additionally, the objective is to \n\nobtain information about different properties, from a single measurement, that contribute to \n\nimmediately adjust the production variables and increase the profitability by producing \n\nwell at the first time, avoiding product loss. \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy have the benefit of \n\ngiving results in just a few minutes, doesn\u2019t need complicate samples preparation, gives \n\ngood predictions and contributes to develop reliable models. For this reason, \n1\nH NMR \n\nspectroscopy was the technique used in this work for the prediction of petroleum fractions \n\nproperties.  \n\nIn laboratory applications the use of both \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy will be \n\nrecommended. However, for industrial applications the \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy will be the \n\nchosen technique.  \n\n \n\n6.2. \n1\nH NMR Spectroscopy in the Analysis of Petroleum Fractions \n\nAs indicated above, \n1\nH NMR has been considered a fast and viable technique to predict \n\npetroleum fractions properties. As a result, in this work, \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy, combined \n\nwith multivariate methods, has been used in the prediction of the physical-chemical \n\nproperties of fuel oil, HVGO and LVGO samples. The physical-chemical properties that \n\nwere measured for each stream, the number of samples analysed by \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy \n\nand some information about the properties results are reported in Table 6.4. The results of \n\nthe development models for all properties analysed in each stream are presented as follows. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n187 \n\n \n\nSince the procedure used to obtain the predicted results was similar in all properties of \n\neach analysed stream, it is only presented in detailed for the first property, i.e., for sulfur \n\ncontent. \n\n \n\nTable 6.4: Number of samples analysed by \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy and minimum and maximum values of the properties \n\nanalysed by the standard methods. \n\nsamples properties \nnumber of \n\nsamples analysed \n\nproperties results \n\nminimum maximum \n\nFuel Oil \n\nSulfur content (% m/m) 213 0.53 3.54 \n\nKinematic viscosity 100 \u00baC (cSt) 217 14.20 1367 \n\nKinematic viscosity 50 \u00baC (cSt) 108 103.2 890.4 \n\nDensity (g/mL) 185 0.9487 1.019 \n\nCarbon residue (% m/m) 103 12.9 22.1 \n\nFlash point (\u00baC) 157 49 102 \n\nP-value 217 1.00 1.8 \n\nLVGO \n\nDensity (g/mL) 105 0.8592 0.9050 \n\nDistillation (\u00baC) \n\n5% 105 227 307 \n\n10% 105 231 322 \n\n50% 105 251 361 \n\n90% 105 279 414 \n\n95% 105 292 417 \n\nHVGO \n\nDensity (g/mL) 189 0.9152 0.9609 \n\nKinematic viscosity 100 \u00baC (cSt) 168 8.050 18.60 \n\nCarbon residue (% m/m) 142 0.08 1.03 \n\nDistillation (\u00baC) \n\n5% 116 359 410 \n\n10% 116 374 418 \n\n50% 116 433 466 \n\n90% 114 484 542 \n\n95% 99 500 558 \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2.1. Fuel Oil \n\nThe purpose of analysing fuel oil with \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy was to verify if it was \n\npossible to use this technique to predict, by only one measurement, several properties \n\nwhich are part of fuel oil specifications. These physical-chemical properties were: i) sulfur \n\ncontent; ii) density; iii) carbon residue; iv) kinematic viscosity; v) flash point; and vi) P-\n\nvalue. The results obtained in predicting these proprieties with \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy will \n\nbe presented below. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n188 \n \n\ni) Sulfur content (% m/m) \n\nTo determine the sulfur content of fuel oil stream using \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy, 213 \n\nsamples were analysed. These samples exhibit a wide variety of results including fuel oil \n\nsamples from cogeneration fuel oil, bunker fuel oil and some fuel oil produced at Sines \n\nrefinery. The 213 samples were divided into three different groups including: i) training \n\ndata set with 127 fuel oil samples; ii) the validation data set with 43 fuel oil samples; and \n\niii) the test data set composed of 43 fuel oil samples. All three different groups were \n\nrepresentative of the data using the procedure described in the Section 5.3. To these \n\nsamples, PCR, PLS and ANN models were applied. Before applying PCR and ANN \n\nmodels, a PCA model was implemented. The statistical performance indexes were used to \n\nevaluate the performance of the models.  \n\nPrior to multivariate modelling, the spectral area used was divided in constant segments of \n\n0.02 ppm. The choice of using a bin width of 0.02 ppm were acquired after analysing the \n\nresults of the statistical parameters obtained with other bins (bin width 0.02, 0.03 and \n\n0.04). As can be seen in Table 6.5, it was with a bin width of 0.02 ppm that better \n\npredictions were obtained, especially for PLS and ANN models. However, for the PCR \n\nmodel, it was with a bin width of 0.03 and 0.04 ppm where slightly better results at the \n\ntraining and validation data sets were obtained. Although, when the PCR model was \n\napplied for the training and validation data sets, satisfactory results were obtained \n\nindependently of the bin used. Besides these small differences, especially for the PCR \n\nmodel, it was considered appropriate using a bin width 0.02 ppm in comparison with bin \n\nwidths of 0.03 and 0.04 ppm. Moreover, it was observed that it was with a bin width 0.02 \n\nppm that higher number of principal components were selected, due to the subdivision of \n\nthe spectra into a higher number of regions, and it was with these 13 PCs that a higher \n\npercentage of the total variance of the original data was explained.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.5: Performance indexes achieved using PCR, PLS and ANN models when applying different bins (bin = 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04). \n\n   \n\nnumber \n\nPC \n\nnumber \n\nLV \n\nnumber \n\nnodes \n\ntotal \n\nvariance \n                              \n\nmodel \n\nperformance \n\nbin = 0.02 \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n13 \n\n  \n\n97.4% \n\n0.59 0.21 0.28 0.00 0.00 0.64 satisfactory \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.47 0.23 0.32 -0.02 -2.74 0.73 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n 3 \n0.96 0.06 0.09 -0.0005 -0.05 0.20 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.91 0.10 0.14 0.02 2.46 0.30 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 34   \n0.99 0.02 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.06 very good \n\ntest \n   \n\n0.92 0.06 0.12 0.003 0.34 0.28 very good \n\nbin = 0.03 \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n10 \n\n  \n\n96.8% \n\n0.62 0.19 0.27 0.00 0.00 0.61 satisfactory \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.51 0.21 0.31 -0.04 -4.31 0.70 satisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n 3 \n0.95 0.07 0.10 -0.002 -0.28 0.23 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.90 0.10 0.14 0.01 1.42 0.32 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 29   \n0.99 0.03 0.04 0.00 0.00 0.09 very good \n\ntest \n   \n\n0.74 0.08 0.22 -0.02 -2.63 0.51 good \n\nbin = 0.04 \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n9 \n\n  \n\n97.0% \n\n0.62 0.20 0.27 0.00 0.00 0.61 satisfactory \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.41 0.22 0.34 -0.03 -3.6 0.77 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n 3 \n0.94 0.08 0.11 0.001 0.15 0.24 very good  \n\ntest \n \n\n0.83 0.11 0.18 0.03 3.65 0.41 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 32   \n0.99 0.03 0.04 0.00 0.00 0.08 very good \n\ntest \n   \n\n0.85 0.09 0.17 -0.0 -1.27 0.39 very good \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n190 \n \n\nThe principal components selected, corresponding to 97.4% of the original data variance, \n\nwere used as inputs of the PCR and ANN models. PCR considered that the variables which \n\nmost influence the predicted sulfur content were only 6 of the 13 PCs, corresponding to \n\nparameters which present statistical significance. Using the PCR model, performance \n\nindexes for the test data set were worse than the results obtained at the training and \n\nvalidation data sets. Analysing the Table 6.6 and taking into account the general \n\nperformance ratings developed by Moriasi et al. (2007) for the test data set, unsatisfactory \n\nresults were obtained while for the training and validation data sets satisfactory results \n\nwere achieved. An unsatisfactory result was obtained in the test data set due to the lower \n\nquality of the performance indexes. Comparing all data sets, the test data set presented \n\nsmall     value and a higher      and     values. Analysing the       and    , it \n\nwas demonstrated that for the test data set, the predicted results presented a significant \n\ndifference when compared to the measured sulfur content, which means that the predicted \n\nresults were underestimated. These results demonstrated that PCR did not predict the \n\nvalues of the test data set and so this model was not robust enough to predict such wide \n\nvariety of results. \n\n \n\nTable 6.6: Performance indexes achieved when using PCR model during training, validation and test data sets, to predict \n\nthe sulfur content of fuel oil samples. \n\n PCR model \n\n training and validation test \n\n       0.59 0.47 \n    0.21 0.23 \n     0.28 0.32 \n    0.00 -0.02 \n      0.00 -2.74 \n    0.64 0.73 \n\nModel performance satisfactory unsatisfactory \n\n \n\n \n\nANN models with different network structures (different numbers of nodes at the hidden \n\nlayer) were tested to find the best network for predicting the different properties.

The \n\nperformance indexes calculated were not very different in both data sets, with the \n\nexception of the       value. The       value was higher at the test data set indicating \n\nthat the predicted results were overestimated, while the predicted results for the training \n\nand validation data sets were underestimated. This       difference may occur because, in \n\nthe test data set, the percentage of samples was lower than that of the training and \n\nvalidation data sets, meaning that, besides the equivalent data sets, the number of samples \n\nencompassed in each data set may influence the       behaviour.  \n\nWhen using the PLS model, the original variables were used as inputs, and the calculation \n\nof the number of latent variables was required for predicting the dependent variable. The \n\nchoice of the number of latent variables was made taking into account the minima of the \n\n       (root mean squared error of cross validation) as plotted in Figure 6.3. The \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n192 \n \n\n       reached a minimum value for 34 LVs, as visualized in Figure 6.3. However, \n\ndifferent models were developed using different number of LVs to compare the \n\nperformance of the PLS model. Apart from the 34 LVs, 16 and 37 LVs were tested (see \n\nTable 6.8). The choice of the 16 and 37 LVs were made taking into account other \n\nminimum of the        plot. It was considered important to analyse the effect of more \n\nand less LVs than the number of LVs indicated by the global minimum in the        \n\nplot. When using 16 LVs the performance indexes were for both, training and validation \n\ndata sets and test data set, slightly worse that the ones obtained with a higher number of \n\nLVs. This behaviour was expected since, typically the quality of the prediction increases \n\nwith the number of latent variables until a certain number of latent variables (Abdi, 2010). \n\nComparing the performance indexes achieved when using 34 and 37 LVs, it was verified \n\nthat the 34 LVs selected at the training and validation data sets contributed to the best \n\nperformances at the test data set. This behaviour, a decrease of the quality of prediction \n\nwith the 37 LVs, can be explained by the increased number of latent variables. When using \n\na higher number of latent variables, if the quality of the prediction decreases this means \n\nthat the model is overfitting the data, i.e., the model becomes more dependent of the data \n\nused at the training data set and will not be useful to fit new observations as the ones \n\nincluded at the test data set (Abdi, 2010). This fact contributes to a better performance of \n\nthe model for the training and validation data sets and a worse performance for the test data \n\nset. As it was expected, for the training and validation data sets, when the     value \n\nincreased with the increased of the latent variables, the     , the     and the     \n\nresults decreased.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n193 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3:        plot for predicting the number of latent variables. \n\n \n\nTable 6.8: Performance indexes achieved when changing the number of LVs in the PLS model. \n\n PLS model \n\n 16 LVs 34 LVs 37 LVs \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.98 0.86 0.99 0.92 0.99 0.91 \n    0.05 0.10 0.02 0.06 0.02 0.07 \n     0.06 0.17 0.03 0.12 0.02 0.13 \n    0.000 -0.010 0.000 0.003 0.000 -0.002 \n      0.00 -1.69 0.00 0.34 0.00 -0.26 \n    0.15 0.38 0.06 0.28 0.05 0.30 \n\nModel performance very good very good very good very good very good very good \n\n \n\n \n\nBetter performance indexes were obtained when 34 LVs were used for modelling the \n\nsulfur content, as visualized in Table 6.8.

Besides having overestimated \n\nresults for the test data set, when calculating the reproducibility between all the predicted \n\nand observed values (Figure 6.4), it was verified that the difference between the values \n\nwere respecting the reproducibility limits defined by the standard test method, which are \n\nderived statistically from especially designed studies. The reproducibility is a standardized \n\nterm adopted by ASTM and other standardization organizations, and was a form to \n\nevaluate the precision of a test method. In this way, the difference between two single and \n\nindependent results obtained by different ways, the measured and predicted results, was \n\ncalculated and then compared with the reproducibility defined by the standard test method. \n\nThe reproducibility of each standard test method analyses the degree of agreement between \n\nthe measured and predicted results and support or challenge the validity of the assumption \n\nthat both test results have been produced on the same material in a correct manner (IP \n\nStandards 336, 2004; Coleman et al., 2008). As visualized in Figure 6.4, it was guaranteed \n\nthat, in average, the predicted sulfur values, the ones experimentally achieved and the ones \n\nobtained with the model, were respecting the reproducibility calculated by the equation \n\ndefined from the IP standard method (Equation 6.1). From all 213 predicted results only 6 \n\nresults of sulfur content, obtained from the difference between the measured and predicted \n\nresults, were out of reproducibility, indicating that \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy could be used to \n\npredict the sulfur content instead of using the IP standard method. The reproducibility \n\ndefined for the sulfur standard test method was determined using the following equation: \n\n \n\n                              (6.1) \n\n \n\nwhere   is the mean sulfur content. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n195 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4: Reproducibility and difference between predicted and observed sulfur content when using PLS model. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 shows the predicted values obtained by the different multivariate models (PCR, \n\nPLS and ANN) and the measured data, corresponding to training and validation data sets \n\nand test data set.

Analysing Figure 6.6 it was \n\npossible to confirm that, it was with the PLS model (Figure 6.6b) that the predictions \n\ncorresponding to both data sets were very close to the ideality, this means, there was a very \n\ngood linear regression relationship of the type y=x, between the predicted and the \n\nmeasured sulfur content.

A low \n\nquality model was achieved when the PCR model was applied (Figure 6.6a). A significant \n\ndifference between the predicted and measured values was evidently, especially when \n\npredicting high sulfur values. Consequently, PLS model is more reliable to predict the \n\nsulfur content of fuel oil samples giving more accurate results and better performance \n\nindexes.  \n\nAs depicted, \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy could be used to predict the sulfur content. The reason \n\nfor this very good correlation, achieved with the PLS model, may be related with the types \n\nof sulfur compounds typically found in fuel oil samples. These compounds may consist of \n\nalkyl sulfides and thiols, thiophene, benzothiophene, and dibenzothiophene. Normally the \n\nalkyl hydrogens close to the sulfur atom in sulfides resonate in the aliphatic region between \n\n2.1 to 3.0 ppm (Nielsen et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n198 \n \n\n a) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nFigure 6.6: Correlation between the experimental and predicted sulfur results of the fuel oil samples obtained by: a) \n\nPCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n0.50 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.50 \n\n2.00 \n\n2.50 \n\n3.00 \n\n3.50 \n\n4.00 \n\n0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n s\n\nu\nlf\n\nu\nr\n (\n\n%\n m\n\n/m\n) \n\nMeasured sulfur (% m/m) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n0.50 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.50 \n\n2.00 \n\n2.50 \n\n3.00 \n\n3.50 \n\n4.00 \n\n0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n s\n\nu\nlf\n\nu\nr\n (\n\n%\n m\n\n/m\n) \n\nMeasured sulfur (% m/m) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n0.50 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.50 \n\n2.00 \n\n2.50 \n\n3.00 \n\n3.50 \n\n4.00 \n\n0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n s\n\nu\nlf\n\nu\nr\n (\n\n%\n m\n\n/m\n) \n\nMeasured sulfur (% m/m) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n199 \n\n \n\nKinematic viscosity \n\nNormally, the kinematic viscosity of fuel oil samples is controlled taking into account the \n\nkinematic viscosity results at standard temperatures of 50 \u00baC and/or 100 \u00baC. The kinematic \n\nviscosity of fuel oil samples can be analysed in terms of both temperatures but in terms of \n\nthe specifications, the kinematic viscosity of a bunker fuel oil is required, for process \n\ncontrol, at 50 \u00baC while the kinematic viscosity of a cogeneration fuel oil required at 100 \u00baC. \n\nIt was considered important to determine the kinematic viscosity of fuel oil samples at both \n\ntemperatures, independently of analysing a bunker or a cogeneration fuel oil. The idea was \n\nto verify if \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy could be used to predict the kinematic viscosity of fuel \n\noil samples at 50 and 100 \u00baC and with that, evaluate the possibility of using an online NMR \n\nspectrometer. It is expected to obtain, with just one analysis, information about the \n\nkinematic viscosity of fuel oil samples at both temperatures independently of the \n\ntemperature at which the NMR experiments were performed. In this work, all the NMR \n\nexperiments were obtained at ambient temperature since deuteriochloroform was the \n\nsolvent selected to prepare the samples. When using deuteriochloroform, the NMR spectra \n\nwere always recorded at room temperature due to its characteristics, such as, its boiling \n\npoint.  \n\n \n\ni) Kinematic viscosity at 100 \u00baC (cSt) \n\nTo analyse the possibility of using an online NMR spectrometer to determine the kinematic \n\nviscosity at 100 \u00baC, 217 fuel oil samples were analysed. These 217 samples included \n\ndifferent fuel oils as cogeneration fuel oil, bunker fuel oil and some fuel oil from Sines \n\nrefinery. As a result, with all these samples, a wide variety of kinematic viscosity results \n\nranging from 14.20 to 1367 cSt was guaranteed. From the 217 fuel oil samples, 131 \n\nsamples represented the training data set and 43 samples constituted the validation and test \n\ndata sets, respectively. As stated previously, all different data sets were representative of \n\nthe data and the procedure used to guarantee such division was described in Section 5.3. \n\nBefore applying multivariate modelling, a bin width 0.02 ppm to divide the spectral area in \n\nconstant segments was used. Subsequently, multivariate modelling and the statistical \n\nparameters indexes were used. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n200 \n \n\nTable 6.9, presents the results obtained when applying the multivariate modelling, PCR, \n\nPLS and ANN, to fuel oil samples. Fourteen principal components were used as inputs of \n\nPCR and ANN. The percentage of the original data variance contained in the 14 PCs was \n\n97.8%. For the ANN model, it was with 3 nodes at the hidden layer that the best results \n\nwere produced. When using PLS model, the minimum of the        plot indicated that \n\n35 LVs to achieve the best results were required. \n\n \n\nTable 6.9: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the viscosity at 100 \u00baC of fuel oil samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.57 0.34 0.99 0.51 0.96 0.94 \n    55.19 58.95 12.12 51.56 16.15 16.53 \n     104.17 85.47 15.68 74.06 31.95 24.49 \n    0.00 3.61 0.0004 7.55 0.52 2.69 \n      0.00 5.27 0.00 11.00 0.69 3.93 \n    0.66 0.81 0.10 0.70 0.20 0.25 \n\nModel performance satisfactory unsatisfactory very good satisfactory very good very good \n\n \n\n \n\nAnalysing Table 6.9 it was possible to conclude that better performance indexes were \n\nachieved with ANN model for both data sets. Very good     values and small residual \n\nvariations were obtained when using the ANN model. The      and     values \n\nobtained, when applying the ANN model, may appear a bit high, but taking into account \n\nthe measured kinematic viscosity values, these errors were acceptable. When analysing the \n\n    and      , it was verified that for both data sets the predicted values were positive, \n\nindicating that, in average, the kinematic viscosity was overestimated. These results \n\nshowed that the models developed by the ANN model, for both data sets, were of higher \n\nquality and characterized with lower error variance. \n\nWhen using the PLS model, for the training and validation data sets, very good results \n\nwere obtained. However, when predicting the test data set only a satisfactory model was \n\nachieved. Even the decrease of the LVs could not improve the final results of the test data \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n201 \n\n \n\nset. For this reason the PLS was not considered a possibility for predicting the kinematic \n\nviscosity of fuel oils. \n\nThe worst performance occurred when applying PCR model. The PCR model failed when \n\npredicting the results of the test data set. However, for the training and validation data sets \n\nslightly better predictions were obtained, although only a satisfactory model was achieved. \n\nEven       indicating accurate model simulation             , the other performance \n\nindexes didn\u2019t performed as good predictions as the       value. \n\nIn Figure 6.7, the representation is a comparison between the prediction values obtained by \n\nthe different multivariate models (PCR, PLS and ANN) and the measured data, \n\ncorresponding to both, training and validation data sets and test data set. With this \n\nrepresentation it was possible to confirm the conclusions previously made. The results \n\nshowed that the use of ANN model led to a more accurate result than PCR and PLS \n\nmodels. PCR was the model that gave the worse performance predicting negative \n\nkinematic viscosity values (18%) for both data sets (Figure 6.7a). In the PLS model (Figure \n\n6.7b), a high degree of correlation was evident when predicting the training and validation \n\ndata sets, whereas the results from the test data set showed larger deviations, compared to \n\nkinematic viscosity values of the training and validation data sets. However, better \n\npredictions with the PLS model were obtained when compared with the PCR model. For \n\nboth data sets, the PLS model produced predictions with 94% of positive values. It was \n\npossible to conclude that the agreement between the predicted kinematic viscosity results \n\nobtained when using the ANN model and the measured kinematic viscosity results was \n\nremarkable, showing a high degree of correlation (see Figure 6.7c). Only the samples with \n\nhigh kinematic viscosity were slightly deviated from what was expected. The ANN model \n\nwas the technique which led to better predictions, and was considered more reliable to \n\npredict the kinematic viscosity of fuel oil samples with a good accuracy. \n\nViscosity can be used to obtain information about the composition of fuel oil samples. As \n\nexample, a paraffinic fraction normally is characterized for having a low viscosity. The \n\ndirect link to the compositional information contained in the NMR spectra resulted, as \n\nexpected, in good kinematic viscosity predictions of the fuel oil samples. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n202 \n \n\n a) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nFigure 6.7: Correlation between the experimental and predicted kinematic viscosity results of the fuel oil samples \n\nobtained at 100 \u00baC by: a) PCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n-200 \n\n0 \n\n200 \n\n400 \n\n600 \n\n800 \n\n1000 \n\n1200 \n\n1400 \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 \n\n P\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n k\n\nin\ne\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n v\n\nis\nc\no\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nc\nS\n\nt)\n \n\nMeasured kinematic viscosity (cSt) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n-200 \n\n0 \n\n200 \n\n400 \n\n600 \n\n800 \n\n1000 \n\n1200 \n\n1400 \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 \n\n P\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n k\n\nin\ne\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n v\n\nis\nc\no\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nc\nS\n\nt)\n \n\nMeasured kinematic viscosity (cSt) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n-200 \n\n0 \n\n200 \n\n400 \n\n600 \n\n800 \n\n1000 \n\n1200 \n\n1400 \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 \n\n P\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n k\n\nin\ne\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n v\n\nis\nc\no\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nc\nS\n\nt)\n \n\nMeasured kinematic viscosity (cSt) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n203 \n\n \n\nii) Kinematic viscosity at 50 \u00baC (cSt) \n\nTo determine the kinematic viscosity at 50 \u00baC, 108 fuel oil samples were analysed. From \n\nall the samples analysed, the training data set included 64 samples while the validation and \n\ntest data sets were formed by 22 fuel oil samples, respectively. Both data sets were \n\nrepresentative of the data. With all samples analysed, bunker and cogeneration fuel oils, a \n\nwide variety of results ranging from 103.2 to 890.4 cSt were guaranteed. As occurred in \n\nthe kinematic viscosity at 100 \u00baC, a bin width 0.02 ppm, multivariate modelling and \n\nstatistical parameters indexes were also used. \n\nThe results obtained when applying the multivariate modelling, PCR, PLS and ANN \n\nmodels, and the statistical parameters indexes are presented in Table 6.10. PCR and ANN \n\nmodels used the PCs as inputs whereas the PLS model was based on the original data. The \n\nnumber of PCs considered by principal component analysis was 15 PCs. These PCs were \n\nresponsible for explaining 98.3% of the original data variance. To apply the ANN model, 3 \n\nnodes at the hidden layer were used while for the PLS model 9 LVs, based on the \n\nminimum of the        plot, were required to obtain the best results. \n\n \n\nTable 6.10: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the viscosity at 50 \u00baC of fuel oil samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.71 0.58 0.85 0.73 0.92 0.74 \n    58.70 77.54 42.70 60.94 28.68 57.54 \n     79.78 93.39 56.84 74.47 42.47 73.61 \n    0.00 -2.72 0.00 4.16 1.08 -14.46 \n      0.00 -0.65 0.00 1.00 0.26 -3.48 \n    0.54 0.65 0.39 0.52 0.29 0.51 \n\nModel performance good satisfactory very good good very good good \n\n \n\n \n\nAs occurred in the prediction of the kinematic viscosity at 100 \u00baC, the best model to predict \n\nthe kinematic viscosity at 50 \u00baC of fuel oil samples was achieved with the ANN model for \n\nboth data sets, as can be visualized in Table 6.10. It was with the ANN model that smaller \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n204 \n \n\nresidual variation and higher     value were achieved when compared with the respective \n\nPCR and PLS results.

Analysing       and     results for the ANN \n\nmodel, it was verified that the results were positive for the training and validation data sets, \n\nmeaning that, in average the predicted kinematic viscosity was overestimated, while for the \n\ntest data set the predicted kinematic viscosity was underestimated. Taking into account the \n\nobtained results (Table 6.10) and following the general performance ratings presented by \n\nMoriasi et al. (2007) the predicted results obtained with the ANN model for the training \n\nand validation data sets were characterized as very good whereas for the test data set the \n\nresults were characterized as good. The same classification was obtained when using the \n\nPLS model, a very good model was achieved for the training and validation data sets while \n\nfor the test data set a good model was obtained. However, when applying the PCR model, \n\nworst predictions were obtained for both data sets. The training and validation data sets \n\nwere characterized as a good model but the test data set was only classified as satisfactory. \n\nAs can be concluded, independently of the model applied worst predictions were obtained \n\nfor the test data set.  \n\nThe conclusions previously made when analysing Table 6.10 can be confirmed by the \n\nfollowing representations. Figure 6.8 shows the kinematic viscosity predictions with all \n\nmodels and the measured data, corresponding to the training and validation data sets and \n\ntest data set. As visualized, it was possible to conclude that the higher degree of correlation \n\nwas obtained when the ANN model was applied (see Figure 6.8c). Although, a slight \n\ndispersion of the predicted values, when using the ANN model, was notable. The PLS \n\n(Figure 6.8b) model gave slightly less accurate results than the ANN model, although still \n\nof high quality. However, the main difference between the results predicted with the ANN \n\nand the PLS models were related with the negative kinematic viscosities predicted by the \n\nPLS model (about 2% of the original data). It was with the PCR model (Figure 6.8a) that \n\nthe main differences between the measured and predicted results were visualized and less \n\naccurate performance indexes were obtained, compared to PLS and ANN models \n\npredictions. The results obtained with the PCR model were surely satisfactory, but it was \n\nwith the ANN model that the agreement between the predicted and measured values was of \n\nhigh quality. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n205 \n\n \n\n a) \n\n b) \n\n c) \n\nFigure 6.8: Correlation between the experimental and predicted kinematic viscosity results of the fuel oil samples \n\nobtained at 50 \u00baC by: a) PCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n-80 \n\n0 \n\n80 \n\n160 \n\n240 \n\n320 \n\n400 \n\n480 \n\n560 \n\n640 \n\n720 \n\n800 \n\n880 \n\n960 \n\n0 80 160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720 800 880 960 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n k\n\nin\ne\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n v\n\nis\nc\no\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nc\nS\n\nt)\n \n\nMeasured kinematic viscosity (cSt) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n-80 \n\n0 \n\n80 \n\n160 \n\n240 \n\n320 \n\n400 \n\n480 \n\n560 \n\n640 \n\n720 \n\n800 \n\n880 \n\n960 \n\n0 80 160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720 800 880 960 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n k\n\nin\ne\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n v\n\nis\nc\no\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nc\nS\n\nt)\n \n\nMeasured  kinematic viscosity (cSt) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n-80 \n\n0 \n\n80 \n\n160 \n\n240 \n\n320 \n\n400 \n\n480 \n\n560 \n\n640 \n\n720 \n\n800 \n\n880 \n\n960 \n\n0 80 160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720 800 880 960 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n k\n\nin\ne\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n v\n\nis\nc\no\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nc\nS\n\nt)\n \n\nMeasured kinematic viscosity (cSt) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n206 \n \n\niv) Density (g/mL) \n\nTo develop a model that contributes to obtain the density results 185 fuel oil samples were \n\nanalysed. From the 185 samples, 37 were used for the test and validation data sets, \n\nrespectively, while the training data set was formed with the remaining 111 fuel oil \n\nsamples. Both data sets were representative of the data. The samples used to develop the \n\nmodel embraced different fuel oils, as the cogeneration fuel oils and bunker fuel oils, and a \n\nwide variety of results ranging from 0.9500 to 1.020 g/mL were included. \n\nAs occurred at the properties previously described, the spectral area was divided in \n\nconstant segments of 0.02 ppm. This bin was preferred over other bin width, as already \n\ndemonstrated, and it was always used for the analysis of fuel oil properties. After the \n\npreparation of the spectral data, multivariate modelling was applied and the statistical \n\nparameters indexes used to evaluate the performance of the developed models. \n\nBefore applying the multivariate models (PCR, PLS and ANN), PCA was used. With PCA \n\nthe number of principal components that were used as inputs of the PCR and the ANN \n\nmodels was identified. For predicting density (g/mL), 15 PCs were required. These PCs \n\nwere responsible for explaining 98.1% of the original data variance. The ANN model was \n\ncharacterized for having 3 nodes at the hidden layer. As already demonstrated the best \n\nnetwork performance was achieved when using the 3 nodes. For all the fuel oil properties \n\nanalysed, 3 nodes at the hidden layer were always used. When applying PLS model, 6 LVs \n\nwere necessary to obtain better performance indexes.  \n\nAnalysing Table 6.11 it was possible to conclude that very good predictions were achieved \n\nfor both data sets with all multivariate models used. However, it was with ANN model that \n\nhigher performance indexes were obtained for both data sets. When compared with PCR \n\nand PLS, it was with the ANN model that higher     values were obtained, indicating \n\nhigher quality models for both data sets. As expect, due to the increase of the coefficient of \n\ndetermination obtained with the ANN model, smaller error indexes were achieved. A \n\ndecrease of the     and      values was indicative of a better model simulation \n\nperformance. By analysing       and     results for the ANN model, it was found that \n\nthese results were positive for both data sets, meaning that, in average the predicted density \n\nof fuel oil was overestimated.

The reproducibility defined by the standard test method for density results was \n\ncalculated by means of Equation 6.2: \n\n \n\n                          (6.2) \n\n \n\nwhere   represents the sample mean. \n\n \n\nTable 6.11: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the density of fuel oil samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.77 0.75 0.79 0.77 0.85 0.86 \n    0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.002 0.002 \n     0.004 0.004 0.004 0.004 0.004 0.003 \n    0.000 -0.001 0.000 -0.001 0.000 0.000 \n       0.00 -0.12 0.00 -0.11 0.03 0.02 \n    0.48 0.50 0.45 0.48 0.38 0.37 \n\nModel performance very good very good very good very good very good very good \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n208 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.9: Reproducibility and difference between predicted and observed density when using ANN models. \n\n \n\nWhen analysing the correlation plot between the predicted and measured density results \n\nobtained with all models applied (Figure 6.10), it was possible to conclude that high \n\nquality models were achieved.

The conclusion was that the \n\nNMR combined with the ANN model could be used to predict acceptable and very good \n\nresults of fuel oil density. Once, the density of fuel oil samples was correlated with \n\nchemical composition.

With these samples a wide variety of results was \n\nguaranteed with the carbon residue values ranging from 12.9 to 22.1% m/m. With all the \n\nsamples analysed, three different groups were developed as the training data set including \n\n61 samples and the validation and test data sets formed with 21 samples, respectively.  \n\nThe multivariate modelling and the statistical performance indexes were applied. PCR and \n\nANN were based on the PCs while PLS was based on the original data. Considering PCA, \n\n15 PCs were select and were responsible for 98.4% of the total variance. To apply the \n\nANN model, the best architecture was achieved with 3 nodes at the hidden layer. When \n\nusing the PLS model, better predictions were obtained when 7 LVs were selected. \n\nTable 6.12 presents the values of the performance indexes using PCR, PLS and ANN \n\nmodels for both training and validation data sets and test data set. The results obtained \n\ndemonstrated that when using the ANN model better performance indexes were obtained \n\nfor both data sets. Additionally, good predictions were obtained for the training and \n\nvalidation data sets when PCR and PLS were applied. However, the problem associated \n\nwith these models was found when applied to the test data set, where unsatisfactory results \n\nwere achieved. The test data set of both models, PCR and PLS, was characterized for \n\nhaving a small     value and high errors. On the other hand, when using the ANN model \n\na higher     value was obtained, for both data sets, and a decrease of the     ,     and \n\n    values was notable when compared with PCR and PLS (see Table 6.12). The results \n\nobtained with the ANN model for the training and validation data sets were underestimated \n\nwhile for the test data set the results were overestimated.

Then, it is possible to conclude that the \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy \n\nwhen combined with the ANN model could be used to predict the carbon residue of fuel oil \n\nsamples. \n\nNMR spectroscopy was always considered a good technique to predict the carbon residue \n\nonce the carbon residue, related to the propensity of the fuel oil samples to form carbon \n\ndeposits, was also related with the chemical composition (Nielsen et al., 2008). The \n\npropensity to form carbon deposits depends on the     ratio and on the content of \n\nasphaltenes. The asphaltenes are characterized for having aromatic and aliphatic \n\ncompounds in its structure, which are different types of hydrocarbons quantified by NMR \n\nspectroscopy.

The training data set was constituted by 95 samples while the \n\nvalidation and test data sets included 31 samples, respectively. The flash point of the fuel \n\noil samples analysed varied between 49 to 102 \u00baC.  \n\nPCR, PLS and ANN models were used to predict the flash point of the fuel oil samples \n\nanalysed and the statistical performance indexes were applied to evaluate the performance \n\nof the developed models. PCR and ANN models were based on the PCs whereas for the \n\nPLS model the original data was used as inputs. After applying the PCA, 15 PCs were \n\nselected corresponding to 98.3% of the original data variance. Considering the ANN model \n\nthe best performance indexes were obtained when using 3 nodes at the hidden layer. \n\nTaking into account the PLS model, the best model was obtained when using 17 LVs.  \n\nThe results obtained when applying the statistical performance indexes for the different \n\nmultivariate models (PCR, PLS and ANN) and for both data sets, training and validation \n\ndata sets and test data set are presented in Table 6.13. The worst performance occurred \n\nwhen PCR was applied for both data sets. A slight improvement was notorious in the test \n\ndata set, but small     value and high errors continued to characterize both data sets, when \n\nthe PCR model was applied. When using the PLS model better predictions were obtained, \n\nwhen compared with PCR results. A very good model was obtained for the training and \n\nvalidation data sets indicating that high     value and small errors as     ,     and \n\n    occurred. However, for the test data set only satisfactory results were obtained. \n\nComparing the three models, it was with ANN model that the best predictions for both data \n\nsets were obtained. Good coefficients of determination and small errors characterized the \n\nperformance indexes obtained for both data sets, when ANN was applied. The     and \n\n      were positive for the training and validation data sets indicating that the predicted \n\nflash point was overestimated, while, for the test data set were negative, meaning that, in \n\naverage, the predicted flash point was underestimated.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n215 \n\n \n\nTable 6.13: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the flash point of fuel oil samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.44 0.60 0.79 0.64 0.67 0.67 \n    5.97 4.93 3.86 4.95 4.66 4.50 \n     7.90 6.59 4.86 6.26 6.06 5.95 \n    0.00 0.57 0.00 0.35 0.31 -0.22 \n      0.00 0.77 0.00 0.48 0.42 -0.30 \n    0.75 0.63 0.46 0.60 0.58 0.57 \n\nModel performance unsatisfactory satisfactory very good satisfactory good good \n\n \n\n \n\nIn Figure 6.13 a comparison between all measured and predicted flash point results \n\nobtained at the training, validation and test data sets when applying all models is \n\nrepresented. It is shown that the ANN model was considered the best model to predict the \n\nflash point of fuel oil samples, showing a good degree of correlation for the training and \n\nvalidation data sets and test data set, simultaneously. The correlation obtained illustrated a \n\ngood agreement between the predicted and measured flash point results, although, as \n\nvisualized in Figure 6.13c, a slight dispersion in the results around the diagonal line was \n\nnotorious. This dispersion between the predicted and measured flash point results was \n\nverified independently of the model applied, however it was mainly pronounced when the \n\nPCR model was used. Figure 6.13a shows that the PCR model was not a good alternative \n\nto estimate the flash point of fuel oil samples. When applying the PLS model, a better \n\nagreement between the predicted and measured flash point results was obtained (Figure \n\n6.13b), although for the test data set larger deviations were achieved and consequently low \n\nquality predictions. Therefore, the \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy combined with ANN model was \n\nconsidered the more reliable approach to predict the flash point of fuel oil samples, giving \n\nthe idea that good performance indexes could be obtained. The flash point is also another \n\nproperty that depends on the chemical composition of fuel oil samples. Normally, samples \n\nwith a higher aromatic content present a higher flash point.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n216 \n \n\n a) \n\n b) \n\n c) \n\nFigure 6.13: Correlation between the experimental and predicted flash point results of the fuel oil samples obtained by: \n\na) PCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n70 \n\n80 \n\n90 \n\n100 \n\n110 \n\n40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n f\n\nla\nsh\n\n p\no\nin\n\nt \n(\u00ba\n\nC\n) \n\nMeasured flash point (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n70 \n\n80 \n\n90 \n\n100 \n\n110 \n\n40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n f\n\nla\nsh\n\n p\no\nin\n\nt \n(\u00ba\n\nC\n) \n\nMeasured flash point (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n40 \n\n50 \n\n60 \n\n70 \n\n80 \n\n90 \n\n100 \n\n110 \n\n40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n f\n\nla\nsh\n\n p\no\nin\n\nt \n(\u00ba\n\nC\n) \n\nMeasured flash point (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n217 \n\n \n\nvii) P-value \n\nTo determine the P-value, 217 fuel oil samples were studied. From all variables, the \n\ntraining data set included 131 samples whereas the validation and test data sets were \n\nconstituted by 43 fuel oil samples, respectively. A wide variety of results were covered \n\nwith the P-value ranging from 1.00 to 1.8. \n\nTo predict the P-value of the fuel oil samples, PCR, PLS and ANN models were applied. \n\nTo evaluate the performance of the developed models the statistical performance indexes \n\nwere used. PCR and ANN models used the PCs as inputs, while PLS was based on the \n\noriginal data. The number of PCs considered by the principal component analysis was 14 \n\nPCs, which were responsible for explaining 97.7% of the original data variance. Using \n\nthese PCs as inputs, the best ANN architecture was achieved when using 3 nodes at the \n\nhidden layer. When using the PLS model, 26 LVs were considered the most adequate for \n\nthe PLS model to perform good predictions.  \n\nTable 6.14 presents the values of the performance indexes using all multivariate models for \n\nboth training and validation data sets and test data set. The results obtained indicated that \n\nPCR was not a good model to predict the P-value, once unsatisfactory models were \n\nobtained for both data sets. However, when using the PLS model, very good predictions \n\nwere obtained for the training and validation data sets but when predicting the test data set \n\nthe performance indexes were not as good. Only satisfactory model was obtained for the \n\ntest data set, indicating that small     value and high errors were achieved. Different \n\nnumbers of latent variables were used, but better predictions were obtained when using the \n\n26 LVs. Additionally, when using the ANN model the same occurred. A good model was \n\nobtained for the training and validation data sets but when analysing the test data set worst \n\nresults were achieved. Nevertheless, the model developed for the test data set was \n\nclassified as satisfactory. The predictions obtained for the test data set when using the \n\nANN model were better when compared with the ones obtained with PCR and PLS \n\nmodels. Higher     value and small errors were obtained with the ANN model for the test \n\ndata set.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n218 \n \n\nTable 6.14: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the P-value of fuel oil samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.50 0.10 0.91 0.53 0.74 0.62 \n    0.07 0.11 0.03 0.08 0.06 0.07 \n     0.11 0.14 0.04 0.10 0.08 0.09 \n    0.00 0.03 0.00 0.02 0.004 0.009 \n      0.00 2.29 0.00 1.84 0.27 0.67 \n    0.71 0.95 0.30 0.68 0.51 0.62 \n\nModel performance unsatisfactory unsatisfactory very good satisfactory good satisfactory \n\n \n\n \n\nAs depicted in Figure 6.14 which shows the linear plot between the measured versus \n\npredicted P-value results obtained for all data sets with all models applied, a very wide \n\ndeviation between the predicted and measured data was notable when the PCR model was \n\napplied. It was observed in Figure 6.14a that there wasn\u2019t an agreement between the \n\npredicted and measured values and hence, low quality predictions were obtained. When \n\napplying the ANN model a better dispersion around the diagonal line, compared to the one \n\nobtained when using the PCR model, was evident (see Figure 6.14c) and consequently, \n\nbetter predictions were achieved. Nevertheless, P-value results smaller than 1.10 and \n\nhigher than 1.70 continued to be predicted very poorly, when the ANN model was applied. \n\nBetter performance indexes for the training and validation data sets were obtained when \n\nthe PLS model was used. As visualized in Figure 6.14b, when using the PLS model, a \n\nsmall dispersion around the diagonal line was achieved, compared to the ones obtained \n\nwhen applying the PCR and ANN models. It was notorious in Figure 6.14b, that better \n\nagreement between the predicted and measured results were achieved, especially for the \n\ntraining and validation data sets. However, for the test data set less accurate model was \n\nobtained and hence, the performance indexes obtained were not as good as the ones \n\nachieved for the training and validation data sets. Taking into account the given \n\ninformation and the results obtained, especially for the test data set, NMR combined with \n\nANN model could be considered a possible technique to predict the P-value of fuel oil \n\nsamples.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n219 \n\n \n\nP-value is a property that gives information about the stability of fuel oils samples. Such \n\nstability is related with the composition of the fuel oil, more specifically, it is related with \n\nthe quantity of asphaltenes. The exact structure of asphaltenes is not known but it is known \n\nthat asphaltenes molecules are constituted by carbon and hydrogen atoms and it is rich in \n\naromatic and aliphatic compounds. This information leads to conclude that NMR is a good \n\ntechnique to predict the P-value content of fuel oil samples, since NMR spectroscopy is a \n\ntechnique that gives information about the chemical composition. In consequence, if the P-\n\nvalue is related with the chemical composition, it should be possible to use NMR to predict \n\nthe P-value content. The results obtained for the training and validation data sets especially \n\nwhen using the PLS and ANN models confirmed that it was possible to obtain good \n\npredictions with those approaches. The worst predictions obtained at the test data set may \n\nbe justified by the number of samples used. The test data set was composed with 43 \n\nsamples and maybe for this property more samples to increase the quality of the developed \n\nmodels were necessary.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n220 \n \n\n a) \n\n b) \n\n c) \n\nFigure 6.14: Correlation between the experimental and predicted P-value results of the fuel oil samples obtained by: a) \n\nPCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n1.00 \n\n1.10 \n\n1.20 \n\n1.30 \n\n1.40 \n\n1.50 \n\n1.60 \n\n1.70 \n\n1.80 \n\n1.90 \n\n2.00 \n\n1.00 1.10 1.20 1.30 1.40 1.50 1.60 1.70 1.80 1.90 2.00 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n P\n\n v\na\nlu\n\ne\n \n\nMeasured P value \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n1.00 \n\n1.10 \n\n1.20 \n\n1.30 \n\n1.40 \n\n1.50 \n\n1.60 \n\n1.70 \n\n1.80 \n\n1.90 \n\n2.00 \n\n1.00 1.10 1.20 1.30 1.40 1.50 1.60 1.70 1.80 1.90 2.00 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n P\n\n-v\na\nlu\n\ne\n \n\nMeasured P-value \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n1.00 \n\n1.10 \n\n1.20 \n\n1.30 \n\n1.40 \n\n1.50 \n\n1.60 \n\n1.70 \n\n1.80 \n\n1.90 \n\n2.00 \n\n1.00 1.10 1.20 1.30 1.40 1.50 1.60 1.70 1.80 1.90 2.00 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n P\n\n-v\na\nlu\n\ne\n \n\nMeasured P-value \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n221 \n\n \n\n6.2.1.1.  Fuel Oil - Final Remarks \n\n1\nH NMR spectroscopy combined with different multivariate models (PCR, PLS and ANN) \n\nwere used to predict the properties of fuel oil samples. At the same time, statistical \n\nperformance indexes were applied to evaluate the performance of each model. As \n\nvisualized in Table 6.15, the ANN model present better performance indexes in almost all \n\nproperties analysed. For the sulfur content it was with the PLS model that better \n\npredictions were obtained. However, when using the ANN model to predict sulfur content \n\nvery good performance indexes were also achieved. In some of the properties studied, PLS \n\nmodel also gave very good results. When applying the PCR model, worst predictions were \n\nobtained. To develop models with more accuracy more fuel oil samples should be \n\nanalysed. Therefore, more experimental data will be required in an attempt to improve the \n\nfinal results.  \n\nConcluding, the final results presented in Table 6.15 demonstrated that \n1\nH NMR \n\nspectroscopy is a good technique to obtain information about the fuel oil properties such as \n\nkinematic viscosity, sulfur content, carbon residue, density, P-value and flash point. The \n\nfinal models highlights that reasonable correlations were achieved when using \n1\nH NMR \n\nspectroscopy, demonstrating that it can contribute to determine some properties with \n\nacceptable accuracy. The great advantage is that \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy can give good \n\npredictions in just a few minutes which lead to control and avoid sample losses. Taking \n\ninto account the obtained results, the possibility of acquiring an online NMR spectrometer \n\nfor Matosinhos refinery is evaluated. It is expected that the use of an online NMR \n\nspectrometer can contribute in the process control and product quality evaluation, \n\nproviding fuel oil samples with the desired properties and respecting the specifications. On \n\nthe other hand, the online monitoring of such properties would also be very important to \n\ncontrol the quantities of cutter stocks used in fuel oil production. An example of a simple \n\neconomic evaluation of the implementation of an online NMR spectrometer at fuel oil \n\nstream is presented in Appendix A. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.15: Results obtained for different properties of fuel oil analysed when using \n1\nH NMR in multivariate models. \n\n   \n\nnumber \n\nPC \n\nnumber \n\nLV \n\ntotal \n\nvariance \n                              \n\nmodel \n\nperformance \n\nSulfur content \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n13 \n\n \n\n97.4% \n\n0.59 0.21 0.28 0.000 0.00 0.64 satisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.47 0.23 0.32 -0.020 -2.74 0.73 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.96 0.06 0.09 -0.001 -0.05 0.20 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.91 0.10 0.14 0.020 2.46 0.30 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 34  \n0.99 0.02 0.03 0.000 0.00 0.06 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.92 0.06 0.12 0.003 0.34 0.28 very good \n\nKinematic \n\nviscosity \n\n100 \u00baC \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n14 \n\n \n\n97.8% \n\n0.57 55.19 104.17 0.00 0.00 0.60 satisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.34 58.95 85.47 3.61 5.27 0.81 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.96 16.15 31.95 0.52 0.69 0.20 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.94 16.50 26.49 2.69 3.93 0.25 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 35  \n0.99 12.12 15.68 0.00 0.00 0.10 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.51 51.56 74.06 7.55 11.00 0.70 satisfactory \n\nKinematic \n\nviscosity \n\n50 \u00baC \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n15 \n\n \n\n98.3% \n\n0.71 58.70 79.78 0.00 0.00 0.54 good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.58 77.54 93.39 -2.72 -0.65 0.65 satisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.92 28.68 42.47 1.08 0.26 0.29 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.74 57.54 73.61 -14.46 -3.48 0.51 good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 9  \n0.85 42.70 56.84 0.00 0.00 0.39 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.73 60.94 74.47 4.16 1.00 0.52 good \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.15: Results obtained for different properties of fuel oil analysed when using \n1\nH NMR in multivariate models (continuation). \n\n   \n\nnumber \n\nPC \n\nnumber \n\nLV \n\ntotal \n\nvariance \n                              \n\nmodel \n\nperformance \n\nCarbon \n\nresidue \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n15 \n\n \n\n98.4% \n\n0.65 0.85 1.09 0.000 0.00 0.59 good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.37 1.28 1.56 -0.490 -2.87 0.79 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.77 0.54 0.88 -0.061 -0.36 0.48 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.70 0.94 1.07 0.260 1.50 0.55 good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 7  \n0.75 0.74 0.93 0.000 0.00 0.50 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.31 1.30 1.63 -0.490 -2.85 0.83 unsatisfactory \n\nFlash point  \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n15 \n\n \n\n98.3% \n\n0.44 5.97 7.90 0.00 0.00 0.75 unsatisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.60 4.93 6.59 0.57 0.77 0.63 satisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.67 4.66 6.06 0.31 0.42 0.58 good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.67 4.50 5.95 -0.22 -0.30 0.57 good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 17  \n0.79 3.86 4.86 0.00 0.00 0.46 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.64 4.95 6.26 0.35 0.48 0.60 satisfactory \n\nP-value \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n14 \n\n \n\n97.7 \n\n0.50 0.07 0.11 0.000 0.00 0.71 unsatisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.10 0.11 0.14 0.030 2.29 0.95 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.74 0.06 0.08 0.004 0.27 0.51 good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.62 0.07 0.09 0.009 0.67 0.62 satisfactory \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 26  \n0.91 0.03 0.04 0.000 0.00 0.30 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.53 0.08 0.10 0.020 1.84 0.68 satisfactory \n\nDensity \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n15 \n\n \n\n98.1% \n\n0.77 0.003 0.004 0.000 0.00 0.48 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.75 0.003 0.004 -0.001 -0.12 0.50 very good \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.85 0.002 0.004 0.000 0.03 0.38 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.86 0.002 0.003 0.000 0.02 0.37 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 6  \n0.79 0.003 0.004 0.000 0.00 0.45 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.77 0.003 0.004 -0.001 -0.11 0.48 very good \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n224 \n \n\n6.2.2. LVGO \n\n1\nH NMR spectroscopy was used to determine some LVGO properties such as density \n\n(ASTM Standards D4052, 2011) and the distillation curves at atmospheric pressure (ISO \n\nStandards 3405, 2011). The main objective of analysing this stream was to evaluate its \n\nfractionation and to ensure that a good separation into the vacuum column was obtained. It \n\nwas for this reason that these two properties were considered the most important to \n\nanalyse. \n\nAs occurred in the analysis of the fuel oil samples, PCR, PLS and ANN were the models \n\nused to predict the LVGO properties. PCR and ANN models were based on the principal \n\ncomponents while PLS model was based on the original data. The statistical performance \n\nindexes were also applied to evaluate the performance of the developed models. The \n\nspectral area was divided in constant segments of 0.02 ppm. It was with this bin that better \n\npredictions were achieved and consequently a bin width of 0.02 ppm was always used for \n\nthe analysis of LVGO properties. The procedure used to determine the best network \n\narchitecture when applying the ANN model was the same as presented for the fuel oil \n\nsamples. The best architecture was achieved with different number of neurons in the input \n\nlayer depending on the number of PCs used, three neurons in the hidden layer and one \n\nneuron in the output layer. When using the PLS model, the original variables were used as \n\ninputs and the choice of the number of latent variables was made taking into account the \n\nminima of the RMSECV (root mean squared error of cross validation) plot. As referred in \n\nTable 6.4 (page 187), the study was performed using 105 LVGO samples for each property \n\nanalysed. Thereby, the training data set included 63 LVGO samples whereas the validation \n\nand test data sets were constituted by 21 LVGO samples, respectively. All three different \n\ngroups were representative of the data using the procedure described in the Section 5.3. \n\n \n\nvi) Density \n\nTable 6.16 presents the performance indexes achieved when applying the different \n\nmultivariate models for the data sets, training and validation data sets and test data set, \n\nwhen predicting the density of LVGO samples.

The PLS model was based on the \n\noriginal data and 13 latent variables to predict the best performance indexes were used. \n\nThe results obtained (see Table 6.16) demonstrated that the best performance indexes were \n\nachieved with the ANN model for both data sets. With the ANN model, high coefficients \n\nof determination or high     values were obtained and very     ,     and     low \n\nvalues were achieved. These results were indication of very good predictions for both data \n\nsets. Taking into account the       and     values, for the training and validation data \n\nsets the predicted results were overestimated, while for the test data set the predicted \n\nvalues were underestimated. Less accurate predictions were obtained when the PLS model \n\nwas applied, although still of high quality. Comparing the PLS and the ANN models, the \n\nmain emphasized differences were the smaller     values and higher     results obtained \n\nwith the PLS model. When applying the PCR model, very good performance indexes were \n\nachieved for the test data set, whereas for the validation and training data sets only \n\nsatisfactory predictions were obtained. \n\n \n\nTable 6.16: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the density of LVGO samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.54 0.80 0.72 0.82 0.92 0.93 \n    0.003 0.003 0.002 0.002 0.001 0.002 \n     0.004 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.002 0.002 \n    0.0000 -0.0007 0.0000 -0.0002 0.0002 -0.0002 \n      0.00 -0.08 0.00 -0.02 0.02 -0.03 \n    0.68 0.44 0.53 0.42 0.29 0.27 \n\nModel performance satisfactory very good good very good very good very good \n\n \n\n \n\nComparing the measured and predicted density results obtained for the training, validation \n\nand test data sets when using all the multivariate models (Figure 6.15) it was possible to \n\nconclude that a high quality model was achieved when the ANN model was applied.

When using the PCR model, higher dispersion around the \n\ndiagonal line was notorious (see Figure 6.15a). As illustrated in Figure 6.15a, the PCR \n\nmodel had more difficult to predict the lower density results of the LVGO samples. \n\nConsequently, low quality predictions were obtained especially for the training and \n\nvalidation data sets.  \n\nIn general, the results obtained indicate that the use of \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy and ANN \n\nmodels is a good alternative to determine the density of LVGO samples.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n227 \n\n \n\n a) \n\n b) \n\n c) \n\nFigure 6.15: Correlation between the experimental and predicted density results of the LVGO samples obtained by: a) \n\nPCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n0.8500 \n\n0.8600 \n\n0.8700 \n\n0.8800 \n\n0.8900 \n\n0.9000 \n\n0.9100 \n\n0.8500 0.8600 0.8700 0.8800 0.8900 0.9000 0.9100 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\ne\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\ng\n\n/m\nL\n\n) \n\nMeasured density (g/mL) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n0.8500 \n\n0.8600 \n\n0.8700 \n\n0.8800 \n\n0.8900 \n\n0.9000 \n\n0.9100 \n\n0.8500 0.8600 0.8700 0.8800 0.8900 0.9000 0.9100 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\ne\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\ng\n\n/m\nL\n\n) \n\nMeasured density (g/mL) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n0.8500 \n\n0.8600 \n\n0.8700 \n\n0.8800 \n\n0.8900 \n\n0.9000 \n\n0.9100 \n\n0.8500 0.8600 0.8700 0.8800 0.8900 0.9000 0.9100 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\ne\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\ng\n\n/m\nL\n\n) \n\nMeasured density (g/mL) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n228 \n \n\nDistillation  \n\nThe distillation curve of LVGO samples is a very important source of information which \n\nneeds to be controlled to confirm that a good separation between LVGO and HVGO, in the \n\nvacuum column, is achieved. The distillation curve of LVGO was determined by defining \n\nthe initial boiling point (IBP) and endpoint (EP). The cuts of the distillation curve that were \n\nanalysed were 5, 10, 50, 90 and 95% (v/v) distillation cuts. These cuts were considered the \n\nmost important to evaluate how the separation of LVGO occurred. \n\n \n\nvi) 5% Distillation \n\nThe results obtained when 5% distillation of LVGO samples were predicted (see Table \n\n6.17) demonstrated that performances were particularly very good, for both data sets, when \n\nthe ANN model was applied. Before applying the ANN model, 16 PCs were used as inputs \n\nof this model, explaining 98.5% of the total variance. The results obtained (Table 6.17) \n\ndemonstrated that the     values or coefficients of determination varied from 0.87 to 0.79 \n\nfor the training and validation data sets and test data set, respectively. The performance \n\nindexes determined, such as,     ,    , and     were smaller for both data sets \n\ncompared with the results obtained for the PCR and PLS models. These coefficients were \n\nthe indicative for a very good model performance. As indicated by       and     the \n\nresults obtained for the test data set were underestimated while the predicted results \n\nobtained for the training and validation data sets were overestimated. When applying the \n\nPCR and PLS models the performance indexes were not as good as the performances \n\nobtained with the ANN model. However good correlations were achieved especially for \n\nthe training and validation data sets. Models with low quality were obtained when \n\npredicting the test data set. Unsatisfactory predictions were achieved for the test data set of \n\nthe PCR and PLS models. For this reason, PCR and PLS models were not considered a \n\ngood alternative to predict the 5% distillation results of a distillation curve.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n229 \n\n \n\nTable 6.17: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the 5% distillation of LVGO samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.74 0.30 0.76 0.29 0.87 0.79 \n    4.77 8.77 4.51 7.68 3.24 5.39 \n     6.64 11.59 6.35 11.72 4.65 6.41 \n    0.00 -0.70 0.00 -0.68 0.53 -0.17 \n      0.00 -0.25 0.00 -0.25 0.19 -0.06 \n    0.51 0.84 0.49 0.84 0.36 0.46 \n\nModel performance good unsatisfactory very good unsatisfactory very good very good \n\n \n\n \n\nThe linear fits of calibration for all the multivariate models used are illustrated in Figure \n\n6.16. As visualized in Figure 6.16c, it was with the ANN model that a better agreement \n\nbetween the predicted and measured 5% distillation results was obtained. Consequently, \n\nthe ANN model predicted the 5% distillation of LVGO samples with the higher accuracy. \n\nHowever, some dispersion between the predicted and measured results was notable and \n\nsome difficult in predicting the 5% distillation temperature of samples with a distillation \n\ntemperature smaller than 255 \u00baC was found.

Comparing the agreement between the predicted and measured \n\nresults for each data set, training and validation data sets and test data set, when using the \n\nANN model, it was visualized that the values of the test data set were not as well predicted \n\nas the ones from the training and validation data sets. Consequently, low quality model was \n\nobtained for the test data set, although still with very good performance.

The       \n\nand     results were positive for both models indicating a slight overprediction. \n\nHowever, when using the PLS model the results were similar with the measure data, as \n\nillustrated in Figure 6.18b. Figure 6.18 shows the measured versus predicted values \n\nobtained for both data sets when applying all the multivariate models, illustrating the range \n\nof the dispersion. As illustrated, independently of the model used, the agreement between \n\nthe predicted and measured values was remarkable, showing that the models were of high \n\nquality and accurate models were achieved. Some dispersion around the diagonal line was \n\nnotable when the PCR model was used (see Figure 6.18a), although this model is still of \n\nhigh quality.   \n\nConsidering the results obtained to predict the 50% distillation of LVGO samples through \n\nthe use of \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy, better performance indexes were achieved when the PLS \n\nmodel with 21 LVs was used. PLS model was more reliable to predict the 50% distillation \n\nof LVGO samples for both data sets. This meant that samples with smaller or higher \n\ntemperature, especially samples of the training and validation data sets, were very well \n\npredicted. Only a few samples of the test data set were slight deviated from the diagonal \n\nline.

Even, for the properties where better \n\npredictions were achieved with the PLS model, very good predictions were also obtained \n\nwith the ANN model. PCR model was not considered such a good model to predict LVGO \n\nproperties as ANN and PLS models. However, when predicting some properties, PCR also \n\ngave good predictions. As expected, the ANN model performed better predictions due to \n\nits ability to develop models around non-linear relationship between the measured \n\nproperties and the predicted results.  \n\nConcluding, \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy is a good technique to obtain information about the \n\nLVGO properties such as density and the distillation at atmospheric pressure. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.22: Results obtained for different properties of LVGO analysed when using \n1\nH NMR in multivariate models. \n\n   \n\nnumber \n\nPC \n\nnumber \n\nLV \n\ntotal \n\nvariance \n                              \n\nmodel \n\nperformance \n\nDensity \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n15 \n\n \n\n98.1% \n\n0.54 0.003 0.004 0.0000 0.00 0.68 satisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.80 0.003 0.003 -0.0007 -0.08 0.44 very good \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.92 0.001 0.002 0.0002 0.02 0.29 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.93 0.002 0.002 -0.0002 -0.03 0.27 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 13  \n0.72 0.002 0.003 0.0000 0.00 0.53 good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.82 0.002 0.003 -0.0002 -0.02 0.42 very good \n\nDistillation \n\n(5%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n16 \n\n \n\n98.5% \n\n0.74 4.77 6.64 0.00 0.00 0.51 good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.30 8.77 11.59 -0.70 -0.25 0.84 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.87 3.24 4.65 0.53 0.19 0.36 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.79 5.39 6.41 -0.17 -0.06 0.46 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 6  \n0.76 4.51 6.35 0.00 0.00 0.49 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.29 7.68 11.72 -0.68 -0.25 0.84 unsatisfactory \n\nDistillation \n\n(10%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n15 \n\n \n\n98.3% \n\n0.73 4.99 7.02 0.00 0.00 0.52 good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.90 3.98 4.86 0.24 0.08 0.31 very good \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.89 2.86 4.42 -0.11 -0.04 0.33 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.90 3.86 4.86 1.24 0.43 0.31 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 21  \n0.96 1.99 2.65 0.00 0.00 0.20 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.75 5.14 7.75 -2.75 -0.96 0.50 very good \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.22: Results obtained for different properties of LVGO analysed when using \n1\nH NMR in multivariate models (continuation). \n\n   \n\nnumber \n\nPC \n\nnumber \n\nLV \n\ntotal \n\nvariance \n                              \n\nmodel \n\nperformance \n\nDistillation \n\n(50%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n16 \n\n \n\n98.5% \n\n0.87 3.56 4.78 0.00 0.00 0.36 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.92 3.78 4.74 1.50 0.47 0.27 very good \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.97 1.63 2.19 -0.03 -0.01 0.17 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.90 4.04 5.42 -0.43 -0.13 0.31 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 21  \n0.99 0.91 1.26 0.00 0.00 0.10 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.92 3.14 5.04 1.14 0.36 0.29 very good \n\nDistillation \n\n(90%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n15 \n\n \n\n98.1% \n\n0.77 6.00 7.79 0.00 0.00 0.48 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n-3.36 15.12 42.50 5.61 1.57 2.09 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.94 2.68 3.87 -0.29 -0.08 0.24 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.91 5.09 6.21 -2.38 -0.67 0.31 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 13  \n0.97 2.28 2.86 0.00 0.00 0.18 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.52 5.73 14.15 -4.12 -1.16 0.70 satisfactory \n\nDistillation \n\n(95%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n16 \n\n \n\n98.4% \n\n0.77 6.62 8.12 0.00 0.00 0.48 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n-1.10 12.86 29.58 6.71 1.83 1.45 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.94 2.43 4.12 -0.82 -0.22 0.24 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.81 7.35 8.96 -0.22 -0.06 0.44 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 22  \n0.99 1.13 1.38 0.00 0.00 0.08 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.85 4.45 7.98 -0.38 -0.11 0.39 very good \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n246 \n \n\n6.2.3. HVGO \n\nThe purpose of analysing the HVGO stream is to evaluate its fractionating and to ensure \n\nthat a good separation into the vacuum column between LVGO, MVGO, HVGO and \n\nresidue is obtained. One of the most important properties used to evaluate the HVGO \n\nsamples is the carbon residue. With this property the quantity of carbon deposits found in \n\nHVGO samples are controlled. As the determination of the carbon residue using the ASTM \n\nstandard method is time consuming, the use of \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy became a possible \n\nalternative to evaluate the HVGO samples. Among carbon residue, kinematic viscosity, \n\ndistillation and density were also considered important parameters to be investigated in \n\norder to evaluate the HVGO stream.  \n\nThe HVGO samples were analysed by \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy and to exploit the full \n\ninformation content of the NMR spectra various multivariate data methods have been used. \n\nPrincipal component regression, partial least squares and artificial neural networks were \n\nthe methods used to predict the HVGO properties, such as occurred when predicting the \n\nfuel oil and LVGO properties. Principal component analysis was also used to reduce the \n\nnumber of predictive variables and to determine the principal components. These principal \n\ncomponents were used as inputs of the PCR and ANN models. However, the PLS model \n\nwas based on the original data. At the same time, the models behaviour was evaluated \n\ncalculating the statistical performance indexes.  \n\nPrior to multivariate modelling, the spectral area was divided in constant segments of 0.02 \n\nppm. As occurred when analysing the fuel oil and LVGO samples, the choice of the bin \n\nwas made taking into account the predictions achieved when evaluating the possibility of \n\nusing other bins. The data pre-processing was the same independently of the samples \n\nanalysed. When applying the ANN model, the procedure used to determine the best \n\nnetwork architecture was the same as presented for the fuel oil and LVGO samples. The \n\nbest architecture was achieved with different numbers of neurons in the input layer \n\ndepending on the number of PCs used, three neurons in the hidden layer and one neuron in \n\nthe output layer. To apply the PLS model, the number of latent variables was determined \n\ntaking into account the minima of the        (root mean squared error of cross \n\nvalidation) plot.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n247 \n\n \n\nTable 6.4 (shown in page 187) presents the number of samples analysed for each property. \n\nIndependently of the number of samples analysed, the data was divided into three different \n\ngroups such as the training, the validation and the test data sets. All three different groups \n\nwere representative of the data using the procedure described in Section 5.3. \n\nThe results obtained for each property are discussed as followed and the values of \n\nperformance indexes calculated for both data sets, training and validation data sets and test \n\ndata set, and for all properties analysed when using the different multivariate models, \n\npresented.  \n\n \n\ni) Density (g/mL) \n\nThe study performed to analyse the prediction of the density of the HVGO samples by \n1\nH \n\nNMR spectroscopy was developed considering 189 samples. The training data set was \n\nconstituted by 113 samples while the validation and test data sets included 38 samples, \n\nrespectively. The density of the HVGO samples analysed varied between 0.9200 to 0.9600 \n\ng/mL. To develop the PCR and ANN models 14 PCs responsible for 98.1% of the total \n\nvariance were used as inputs while for the PLS model, 11 LVs were necessary.  \n\nTable 6.23 presents the values of the performance indexes using PCR, PLS and ANN \n\nmodels for both, training and validation data sets and test data set. The results obtained \n\ndemonstrated that only the ANN model presented better predictions for both data sets. \n\nWhen using the other models, PCR and PLS models, worst predictions were obtained \n\nespecially for the test data set. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n248 \n \n\nTable 6.23: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the density of HVGO samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.64 -0.48 0.73 0.28 0.76 0.76 \n    0.002 0.003 0.002 0.003 0.002 0.002 \n     0.004 0.007 0.003 0.005 0.003 0.003 \n    0.0000 0.0008 0.0000 0.0002 0.0000 -0.0003 \n      0.00 0.09 0.00 0.02 0.00 -0.03 \n    0.60 1.22 0.52 0.84 0.49 0.49 \n\nModel performance satisfactory unsatisfactory good unsatisfactory very good very good \n\n \n\n \n\nThe results presented in Table 6.23 show that the use of the ANN model led to more \n\naccurate results than the PCR and PLS models, for both data sets. It was with the ANN \n\nmodel that higher coefficients of determination or     values were obtained for both data \n\nsets. In addition, it was also with the ANN model that smaller errors were achieved, such \n\nas smaller     ,     and     results.       and     were negatives for the ANN \n\nmodel and both data sets, meaning that the predicted density values were underestimated. \n\nWhen analysing the linear plot between the measured and the predicted density by the \n\ndifferent multivariate models and for both data sets (Figure 6.21), the same conclusions \n\nwere made. As illustrated, it was with the ANN model that the agreement between the \n\npredicted and measured results were most remarkable (see Figure 6.21c). Some dispersion \n\naround the diagonal line was notorious, especially for higher density results. However, \n\nsamples with smaller density values were very well predicted. Consequently, the models \n\nobtained, for both data sets, when using the ANN model were of very good quality. Less \n\naccurate models were achieved when the PCR and PLS models were applied. As visualized \n\nin Figure 6.21a and Figure 6.21b, larger deviations between the predicted and measured \n\nvalues were obtained showing that these developed models were of low quality, especially \n\nwhen predicting the samples of the test data set. \n\nConcluding, \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy combined with the ANN model was the most reliable \n\nto predict the density of HVGO samples.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n249 \n\n \n\n a) \n\n b) \n\n c) \n\nFigure 6.21: Correlation between the experimental and predicted density of the HVGO samples obtained by: a) PCR, b) \n\nPLS and c) ANN models. \n\n0.9000 \n\n0.9100 \n\n0.9200 \n\n0.9300 \n\n0.9400 \n\n0.9500 \n\n0.9600 \n\n0.9700 \n\n0.9800 \n\n0.9900 \n\n1.0000 \n\n0.9000 0.9100 0.9200 0.9300 0.9400 0.9500 0.9600 0.9700 0.9800 0.9900 1.0000 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\ne\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\ng\n\n/m\nL\n\n) \n\nMeasured density (g/mL) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n0.9000 \n\n0.9100 \n\n0.9200 \n\n0.9300 \n\n0.9400 \n\n0.9500 \n\n0.9600 \n\n0.9700 \n\n0.9800 \n\n0.9900 \n\n1.0000 \n\n0.9000 0.9100 0.9200 0.9300 0.9400 0.9500 0.9600 0.9700 0.9800 0.9900 1.0000 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\ne\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\ng\n\n/m\nL\n\n) \n\nMeasured density (g/mL) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n0.9000 \n\n0.9100 \n\n0.9200 \n\n0.9300 \n\n0.9400 \n\n0.9500 \n\n0.9600 \n\n0.9700 \n\n0.9800 \n\n0.9900 \n\n1.0000 \n\n0.9000 0.9100 0.9200 0.9300 0.9400 0.9500 0.9600 0.9700 0.9800 0.9900 1.0000 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\ne\nn\n\nsi\nty\n\n (\ng\n\n/m\nL\n\n) \n\nMeasured density (g/mL) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n250 \n \n\nii) Kinematic viscosity at 100\u00baC (cSt) \n\nTo predict the kinematic viscosity at 100 \u00baC, 168 HVGO samples were analysed. From the \n\n168 HVGO samples, 100 samples represented the training data set while 34 samples \n\nconstituted the validation and test data sets, respectively. With all these samples, a wide \n\nvariety of kinematic viscosity results ranging from 8.050 to 18.60 cSt were guaranteed. \n\nTable 6.24 presents the performance indexes achieved when applying the different \n\nmultivariate models for both data sets, training and validation data sets and test data set, \n\nwhen predicting the kinematic viscosity of HVGO samples. Sixteen principal components, \n\nexplaining 98.3% of the original data variance were used as inputs of the PCR and ANN \n\nmodels while for the PLS model 20 LVs to perform good PLS models were required. As \n\nvisualized in Table 6.24, better performance indexes were achieved with the PLS and ANN \n\nmodels for both data sets. However, when applying the PCR model good predictions were \n\nobtained for the training and validation data sets, whereas for the test data set \n\nunsatisfactory results were achieved. PCR was not considered a good model to predict the \n\nkinematic viscosity of HVGO samples due to the performance indexes obtained. This \n\nmodel was characterized for having insignificant coefficient of determination or negative \n\n    results which indicated that the mean observed value was better measured than \n\npredicted, meaning that unacceptable performances were obtained. Analysing the errors \n\nobtained, it was verified that higher     ,     and     values were achieved with the \n\nPCR model. \n\n \n\nTable 6.24: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the kinematic viscosity at 100 \u00baC of HVGO samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.68 -0.20 0.97 0.93 0.87 0.84 \n    0.54 0.96 0.16 0.27 0.34 0.46 \n     0.78 1.60 0.22 0.39 0.50 0.58 \n    0.00 0.19 0.00 -0.12 0.02 0.07 \n      0.00 1.75 0.00 -1.12 0.14 0.64 \n    0.56 1.10 0.16 0.27 0.36 0.40 \n\nModel performance good unsatisfactory very good very good very good very good \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n251 \n\n \n\nAs visualized in Table 6.24, when using the PLS model, better predictions were obtained \n\nfor both data sets. It is important to point out that when using the PLS model very good \n\n    values were obtained for both data sets. It was with this model that the smallest errors \n\nwere obtained, such as, smaller     ,     and     results, when compared with the \n\nones obtained with the PCR and ANN models. Analysing the       and     values, it \n\nwas possible to conclude that accurate model simulation was obtained for the training and \n\nvalidation data sets, whereas for the test data set the predicted results were underestimated. \n\nAs illustrated in Figure 6.22b, which shows the measured and predicted values of the \n\nkinematic viscosity determined by PLS model for both data sets, the predicted results \n\nobtained presented a very good agreement with the experimental values. Small and high \n\nHVGO kinematic viscosities were well predicted when using the PLS model and \n\nconsequently high quality models, for both data sets, were achieved. Less accurate models \n\nwere obtained when the ANN model was applied, although still of high quality with both \n\ndata sets characterized with very good predictions. As indicated in Figure 6.22c larger \n\ndeviations compared to Figure 6.22b were found as well as some difficulties in predicting \n\nhigher kinematic viscosities of the HVGO samples. However, the ANN model predict \n\nmore than 80% of the data. The same predictions were not possible to obtain when using \n\nthe PCR model. As illustrated in Figure 6.22a a weak agreement between the predicted and \n\nmeasured results were found when the PCR model was applied, especially for the test data \n\nset. Consequently, unsatisfactory predictions were achieved. Figure 6.22 clearly \n\ndemonstrated that \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy combined with the PLS model could be a very \n\ngood alternative to predict the kinematic viscosity of HVGO samples.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n252 \n \n\n a) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nFigure 6.22: Correlation between the experimental and predicted kinematic viscosity at 100 \u00baC of the HVGO samples \n\nobtained by: a) PCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n7.50 \n\n9.50 \n\n11.50 \n\n13.50 \n\n15.50 \n\n17.50 \n\n19.50 \n\n7.50 9.50 11.50 13.50 15.50 17.50 19.50 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n k\n\nin\ne\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n v\n\nis\nc\no\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nc\nS\n\nt)\n \n\nMeasured kinematic viscosity (cSt) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n7.50 \n\n9.50 \n\n11.50 \n\n13.50 \n\n15.50 \n\n17.50 \n\n19.50 \n\n7.50 9.50 11.50 13.50 15.50 17.50 19.50 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n k\n\nin\ne\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n v\n\nis\nc\no\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nc\nS\n\nt)\n \n\nMeasured kinematic viscosity (cSt) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n7.50 \n\n9.50 \n\n11.50 \n\n13.50 \n\n15.50 \n\n17.50 \n\n19.50 \n\n7.50 9.50 11.50 13.50 15.50 17.50 19.50 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n k\n\nin\ne\nm\n\na\nti\n\nc\n v\n\nis\nc\no\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nc\nS\n\nt)\n \n\nMeasured kinematic viscosity (cSt) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n253 \n\n \n\niii) Carbon residue (% m/m) \n\nAs already stated, carbon residue is a very important property that provides information on \n\ncoking propensity of HVGO samples during combustion or conversion process in \n\nhydrotreatment units. To determine this property using \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy, 142 HVGO \n\nsamples were analysed. The training data set was composed by 86 samples while the test \n\nand the validation data sets were formed with 28 samples each. With all samples analysed, \n\na wide variety of results ranging from 0.08 to 1.03% m/m were guaranteed. To develop the \n\nPCR and ANN models 15 principal components, explaining 98.2% of the original data \n\nvariance, were used as inputs. For the PLS model, 17 LVs were required. \n\nAs visualized in Table 6.25, the performance indexes calculated for the training and \n\nvalidation data sets and for the test data set demonstrated that the PLS model performed \n\nvery good predictions.

Since very good predictions were obtained when using the PLS model, \n\nthis model was considered the best one to predict the carbon residue of HVGO samples. As \n\nanalysed in Figure 6.23b, the developed model gave accurate results, although some \n\ndispersion between the measured and predicted results were notorious, especially for the \n\ntest data set. The larger deviation between the predicted and measured values of the test \n\ndata set could be the reason why the performance indexes obtained for the test data set was \n\nnot as high as the ones obtained for the training and validation data sets. Although, for both \n\ndata sets, the develop models were of very good quality predicting 91 and 76% of the data \n\nfor the training and validation data sets and test data set, respectively. Smaller correlations \n\nwere obtained when the PCR and ANN model were used. As visualized in Figure 6.23a \n\nand Figure 6.23c, the PCR and ANN models presented some difficulties in predicting \n\nsmaller and higher carbon residue values. Moreover, larger deviations between the \n\npredicted and experimental carbon residue results, when compared to Figure 6.23b, were \n\nfound. Though, these larger deviations were more pronounced when the PCR model was \n\napplied demonstrating that the agreement between the predicted and measured carbon \n\nresidue was not remarkable. For these reasons, PCR model, which haven\u2019t predicted more \n\nthan 48% of the test data set, were not considered a good model to predict the carbon \n\nresidue of HVGO samples. On the other hand, the ANN model gave slightly more accurate \n\nresults than the PCR model and a better agreement between the predicted and measured \n\nresults were achieved, as illustrated in Figure 6.23c. Consequently, models with better \n\nquality, for both data sets, than the ones achieved with the PCR model were obtained. \n\nANN model predicted more than 70% of the data. Figure 6.23 demonstrated that \n1\nH NMR \n\nspectroscopy combined with the PLS model could be an alternative to the ASTM standard \n\ntest method to determine the carbon residue of the HVGO samples. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n255 \n\n \n\n a) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nFigure 6.23: Correlation between the experimental and predicted carbon residue of the HVGO samples obtained by: a) \n\nPCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n0.06 \n\n0.16 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.36 \n\n0.46 \n\n0.56 \n\n0.66 \n\n0.76 \n\n0.86 \n\n0.96 \n\n1.06 \n\n0.06 0.16 0.26 0.36 0.46 0.56 0.66 0.76 0.86 0.96 1.06 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n c\n\na\nr\nb\n\no\nn\n\n r\ne\nsi\n\nd\nu\n\ne\n (\n\n%\n m\n\n/m\n) \n\nMeasured carbon residue (% m/m) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n0.06 \n\n0.16 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.36 \n\n0.46 \n\n0.56 \n\n0.66 \n\n0.76 \n\n0.86 \n\n0.96 \n\n1.06 \n\n0.06 0.16 0.26 0.36 0.46 0.56 0.66 0.76 0.86 0.96 1.06 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n c\n\na\nr\nb\n\no\nn\n\n r\ne\nsi\n\nd\nu\n\ne\n (\n\n%\n m\n\n/m\n) \n\nMeasured carbon residue (% m/m) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n0.06 \n\n0.16 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.36 \n\n0.46 \n\n0.56 \n\n0.66 \n\n0.76 \n\n0.86 \n\n0.96 \n\n1.06 \n\n0.06 0.16 0.26 0.36 0.46 0.56 0.66 0.76 0.86 0.96 1.06 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n c\n\na\nr\nb\n\no\nn\n\n r\ne\nsi\n\nd\nu\n\ne\n (\n\n%\n m\n\n/m\n) \n\nMeasured carbon residue (% m/m) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n256 \n \n\nDistillation \n\nAs occur for LVGO samples, the cuts of the distillation curve that were analysed to \n\nevaluate the HVGO samples were the 5, 10, 50, 90 and 95% distillation cuts. Analysing \n\nthese cuts of the distillation curve it was evaluate how the separation of the HVGO stream \n\noccurred. The idea was to verify if there were no losses of HVGO and if some residue were \n\ncollected in the HVGO stream. \n\n1\nH NMR spectroscopy was used to verify if it can described, with good precision, the \n\ndistillation curve of HVGO samples. \n\n \n\niv) 5% Distillation \n\nWhen predicting 5% distillation cut of HVGO samples through the use of \n1\nH NMR \n\nspectroscopy 116 samples were used, from which, 70 samples composed the training data \n\nset while 23 samples formed the validation and test data sets, respectively. This distillation \n\ncut included a wide variety of results ranging from 374 to 418 \u00baC. Thirteen principal \n\ncomponents, responsible for explaining 98.3% of the total variance, were used as inputs of \n\nthe PCR and ANN models. Considering the PLS model, 10 LVs were required. \n\nTable 6.26 clearly demonstrated the results of the performance indexes obtained when \n\nusing PCR, PLS and ANN models to predict both data sets, training and validation data \n\nsets and test data set. As visualized, the predictions obtained were not as good as expected. \n\nIt was expected better predictions with all applied models. Only the PLS model was able to \n\npredict the 5% distillation cut of the HVGO samples. When using the ANN model only \n\nsatisfactory results were obtained for both data sets.

When applying the ANN model a \n\nsmall improvement was achieved and therefore, the model classified as satisfactory. On the \n\nother hand, when applying the PLS model better predictions were obtained. The PLS \n\nmodel, classified as very good, was characterized for predicting 75% of the data. It was \n\nwith the PLS model that high     value, for the training and validation data sets, was \n\nobtained. Moreover, small errors, such as smaller     ,     and     values, were also \n\nachieved for the training and validation data sets comparing with those obtained with the \n\nPCR and ANN models. The results obtained with       and     were indicative that an \n\naccurate model simulation was achieved whit the PLS model. \n\nWhen analysing the results with all models only for the test data set, it was verified that \n\nworse predictions were obtained when comparing with those achieved for the training and \n\nvalidation data sets. As visualized in Table 6.26, the PCR model was not a good choice to \n\ndetermine the 5% distillation cut of HVGO samples. The model obtained was classified as \n\nunsatisfactory. The results obtained with the ANN model were also not so good. As \n\noccurred for the training and validation data sets, the best model to predict the 5% \n\ndistillation cut of the HVGO samples, for the test data set, was the PLS model. With this \n\nmodel, a good     value was achieved and when comparing with the other results \n\nobtained for the test data set, it was with the PLS model, that small errors were obtained. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n258 \n \n\nThe results obtained with the PLS model for       and     were negative, meaning that, \n\nthe predicted 5% distillations were underestimated. \n\nFigure 6.24 depicts a correlation plot between the predicted and measured results obtained \n\nwhen applying the multivariate models and the standard test method, respectively. As \n\nillustrated in Figure 6.24b, it was with the PLS model that better agreement between the \n\npredicted and measured results was obtained and hence best performance, for both data \n\nsets, were achieved. Although, some dispersion between the predicted and measured \n\nresults was visualized as well as some difficulties to predict lower temperatures of the 5% \n\ndistillation cut of HVGO samples. The larger deviations between the predicted and \n\nexperimental results was more notorious at the test data set. These larger deviations of the \n\nsamples from the test data set could be one of the reasons that justify the lower predictions \n\nat the test data set, compared to the training and validation data sets. Despite these results, \n\nit was with the PLS model that the most accurate models to predict the 5% distillation cut \n\nwere achieved. When using the ANN model less accurate models than the ones obtained \n\nwith the PLS model were found. Larger deviations between the predicted and measured \n\nresults were visualized, for both data sets, when applying the ANN model. Moreover, \n\ndifficulties in predicting higher values of the 5% distillation cut was also illustrated in \n\nFigure 6.24c. Figure 6.24a clearly demonstrates that very low quality models were \n\nobtained when the PCR model was applied. No agreement between the predicted and \n\nmeasured results were visualized in Figure 6.24a and consequently the PCR model was not \n\nconsidered an alternative to predict the 5% distillation cut of HVGO samples. Concluding, \n\nthe PLS model was the most reliable to predict the 5% distillation cut of the HVGO \n\nsamples.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n259 \n\n \n\n a) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nFigure 6.24: Correlation between the experimental and predicted 5% distillation cut of the HVGO samples obtained by: \n\na) PCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n350 \n\n360 \n\n370 \n\n380 \n\n390 \n\n400 \n\n410 \n\n420 \n\n350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\nis\nti\n\nll\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00baC\n\n) \n\nMeasured distillation (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n350 \n\n360 \n\n370 \n\n380 \n\n390 \n\n400 \n\n410 \n\n420 \n\n350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\nis\nti\n\nll\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00baC\n\n) \n\nMeasured distillation (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n350 \n\n360 \n\n370 \n\n380 \n\n390 \n\n400 \n\n410 \n\n420 \n\n350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\nis\nti\n\nll\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00baC\n\n) \n\nMeasured distillation (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n260 \n \n\niv) 10% Distillation \n\nTo determine the cut of 10% distillation, 116 HVGO samples were studied. With all these \n\nsamples, a wide variety of results was guaranteed with the 10% distillation cut ranging \n\nfrom 374 to 418 \u00baC. From all variables, three data sets were formed, and the training data \n\nset composed of 70 samples while the validation and test data sets were constituted by 23 \n\nsamples, respectively. Before applying PCR and ANN models, principal component \n\nanalysis was used to determine the number of PCs used as inputs of these models. Twelve \n\nprincipal components, explaining 98.1% of the total variance, were selected. To apply the \n\nPLS model, the number of latent variables were also selected and better predictions were \n\nobtained when 10 LVs were used. \n\nThe performance indexes obtained when applying all multivariate models for both training \n\nand validation data sets and test data set were presented in Table 6.27. As visualized, only \n\nthe PLS model was able to predict the 10% distillation cut, for both data sets. With the PLS \n\nmodel very good predictions were obtained for the training and validation data sets and for \n\nthe test data set, good predictions were achieved. When applying the ANN models, very \n\ngood predictions were obtained for the training and validation data sets. However, the \n\nsame doesn\u2019t occur for the test data set, which was classified as an unsatisfactory model. In \n\naddition, unsatisfactory predictions were also obtained for both data sets when the PCR \n\nmodel was applied.

The application of PCR model was not considered a good way to predict \n\nthe 10% distillation cut of HVGO samples. However, the use of ANN and PLS models led \n\nto more accurate results than the PCR model. Very good predictions were obtained when \n\nusing the ANN and PLS models. Although the ANN and PLS models presented similar \n\nresults, for the training and validation data sets, the PLS model was considered to be the \n\nbest. The main difference, when analysing the performance indexes achieved (Table 6.27) \n\nwere found in       and     results. For the PLS model the       and     results \n\nwere indicative that an accurate model simulation was achieved, while, for the ANN \n\nmodel,       and     were negative, meaning that, the predicted 10% distillation results \n\nwere underestimated. \n\nSuch good results, as those obtained for the training and validation data sets, were not \n\nachieved for the test data set. Table 6.27 shows that the application of the PLS model was \n\nconsidered better than using PCR and ANN models to predict the 10% distillation cut of \n\nthe HVGO samples. Considering the PCR and ANN models, it was observed that the \n\npredicted results were not adjusted to the measured data. Both these methods were not able \n\nto predict, for the test data set, the 10% distillation cut of the HVGO samples. The \n\npredictions obtained with the PLS model for the test data set were classified as good, \n\nmeaning that, a good     value and small errors, compared with those obtained for the \n\nANN and PCR models, were attained. Taking into account the results obtained with the \n\n      and    , the predicted 10% distillation were underestimated. \n\nThe results obtained indicated that \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy could predict the 10% \n\ndistillation cut of the HVGO samples by using the PLS model. As visualized in Figure \n\n6.25b, which shows the predicted and measured values and the goodness of the fit \n\nobtained, it was with the PLS model that a better agreement between the predicted and \n\nmeasured results was achieved. Some dispersion around the calibration line was also \n\nillustrated, especially for the test data set, indicating that less quality performance indexes \n\nwere obtained for the test data set, compared to the ones obtained for the training and \n\nvalidation data sets. In spite of the performance indexes obtained for both data sets when \n\nusing the PLS model were not of higher accuracy, it was with the PLS model that the best \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n262 \n \n\npredictions were achieved. With the ANN model, as illustrated in Figure 6.25c, the training \n\nand validation values mostly coincide with the calibration line, whereas the test data set \n\nshowed larger deviations, compared with the Figure 6.25b. These larger deviations from \n\nthe test data set contributed to a less quality model and consequently lower performance \n\nindexes. Moreover, low quality models were also obtained when the PCR model was \n\napplied. As illustrated in Figure 6.25a, no agreement between the predicted and measured \n\nresults, for both data sets, were found when the PCR model was used. These results leads \n\nus to conclude that PLS model was the most reliable to predict the 10% distillation cut of \n\nthe HVGO samples. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n263 \n\n \n\n a) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nFigure 6.25: Correlation between the experimental and predicted 10% distillation cut of the HVGO samples obtained by: \n\na) PCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n360 \n\n370 \n\n380 \n\n390 \n\n400 \n\n410 \n\n420 \n\n430 \n\n360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\nis\nti\n\nll\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00baC\n\n) \n\nMeasured distillation (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n360 \n\n370 \n\n380 \n\n390 \n\n400 \n\n410 \n\n420 \n\n430 \n\n360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\nis\nti\n\nll\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00baC\n\n) \n\nMeasured distillation (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n360 \n\n370 \n\n380 \n\n390 \n\n400 \n\n410 \n\n420 \n\n430 \n\n360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\nis\nti\n\nll\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00baC\n\n) \n\nMeasured distillation (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n264 \n \n\nv) 50% Distillation \n\nThe prediction of 50% distillation of HVGO samples was made using 116 samples.

On the other hand, a good model was obtained \n\nwhen applying the ANN model and when using the PLS model very good predictions were \n\nachieved. For the training and validation data sets, the best performance indexes were \n\nobtained when the PLS model was applied. The PLS model was characterized for \n\npresenting a high     value and small errors, such as a smaller     ,     and     \n\nresults, comparing with those obtained with PCR and ANN models. The       and     \n\nobtained with the PLS model were indicative that an accurate model simulation was \n\nachieved. \n\nTaking into account the predicted results obtained for the test data set, when using all \n\ndifferent multivariate models, the results were not as good as the results obtained for the \n\ntraining and validation data sets. As visualized in Table 6.28, the PCR model was not able \n\nto predict the 50% distillation cut of the HVGO samples and unsatisfactory predictions \n\nwere obtained. Better results than the ones obtained with the PCR model were achieved \n\nwith the PLS model, nevertheless, only satisfactory predictions were obtained. It was only \n\npossible to obtain good predictions when using the ANN model. This model was \n\ncharacterized for presenting good performance indexes, taking into account the \n\nperformance ratings developed by Moriasi et al. (2007) (see Section 5.4). Also it was with \n\nthe ANN model that smaller errors were obtained for the test data set. The     and       \n\nvalues indicated that the model developed by the ANN was overestimated. \n\nFigure 6.26, which depicts a correlation plot of the measured and predicted results with all \n\nmodels, confirmed that the ANN model is the most reliable to predict the 50% distillation \n\ncut of HVGO samples. As illustrated in Figure 6.26c, it was with the ANN model that a \n\nbetter agreement between the predicted and experimental results, especially for the test \n\ndata set, was found. It was visualized some deviation of the predicted results from the \n\ncorrelation line, although it was with the ANN model that the performance indexes of both \n\ndata sets were in accordance and high quality model for the test data set was achieved. \n\nWhen applying the PLS model (Figure 6.26b), it was visualized that the training and \n\nvalidation results almost coincide with the calibration line, although the same doesn\u2019t \n\noccur for the test data set. As visualized, larger deviations of the test data set from the \n\ncalibration line, compared to Figure 6.26c, were achieved. To confirm the results obtained \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n266 \n \n\nwhen using the PLS model, the samples included in the test data set where changed with \n\nthe samples encompassed at the training and validation data sets, although the same \n\nbehaviour occur. The PLS model was unable to predict the test data set with high accuracy \n\nas occur for the training and validation data sets. This behaviour could indicate that the \n\nselection criterion of taking the number of LVs that corresponds with the minimal \n\nRMSECV value might result in overfitting the data, although, as expected, the use of less \n\nLVs contributed to less accurate models for both data sets.

From the 114 samples, 68 composed the training data set while 23 \n\nwere used for the validation and test data sets, respectively. The samples used to develop \n\nthe model included a wide variety of results ranging from 484 to 542 \u00baC. Before applying \n\nthe multivariate models the principal component analysis was used. With the PCA, the \n\nnumber of principal components used as inputs of the PCR and the ANN models were \n\nselected. For predicting the 90% distillation cut, 12 PCs, responsible for explaining 98.1% \n\nof the original data variance, were required. When applying PLS model, 12 LVs were \n\nselect. \n\nTable 6.29 demonstrates the results of the performance indexes obtained after applying all \n\ndifferent multivariate models for both training and validation data sets and test data set. As \n\nanalysed, bad predictive performance were obtained when predicting the 90% distillation \n\ncut of the HVGO samples. Independently of the model applied, the PCR, PLS and ANN \n\nmodels, unsatisfactory predictions were obtained for the test data set, meaning that, neither \n\nmodels were able to predict the measured values from the test data set. For the training and \n\nvalidation data sets better predictions were achieved when using the ANN and the PLS \n\nmodels. However, it was with the PLS model that the best performance were obtained. It \n\nwas with the PLS model that the predicted results were closer from the measured data and \n\nhigher     value was obtained, compared with those achieved for the PCR and ANN \n\nmodels. The smaller errors, such as, a smaller     ,     and    , were also found at the \n\ntraining and validation data sets when using the PLS model. The       and     results \n\nindicated that an accurate model simulation was achieved when using the PLS model. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n269 \n\n \n\nTable 6.29: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the 90% distillation cut of HVGO samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.25 0.20 0.75 0.48 0.58 0.50 \n    4.78 5.23 2.92 4.44 3.81 4.32 \n     6.70 7.01 3.85 5.67 5.02 5.55 \n    0.00 0.81 0.00 0.25 0.25 -0.40 \n      0.00 0.15 0.00 0.05 0.05 -0.08 \n    0.86 0.89 0.50 0.72 0.64 0.71 \n\nModel performance unsatisfactory unsatisfactory good unsatisfactory satisfactory unsatisfactory \n\n \n\nIn Figure 6.27, which shows the linear plot between the predicted and measured results \n\nobtained with all models applied (PCR, PLS and ANN models) as well as the standard test \n\nmethod, it was possible to visualize that some dispersion around the calibration line existed \n\nindependently of the model applied. Low quality predictions were achieved when the PCR \n\nmodel was used. As illustrated in Figure 6.27a, the developed model was unable to predict \n\nsamples with lower and higher values of the 90% distillation cut. Consequently, \n\nunsatisfactory predictions characterized both data sets when the PCR model was used. \n\nSurely satisfactory predictions, for the training and validation data sets, were obtained \n\nwhen the ANN model was applied, as visualized in Figure 6.27c. Although, for the test \n\ndata set larger deviations between the predicted and measured values were achieved. \n\nConsequently, the ANN model was also not considered an alternative to predict the 90% \n\ndistillation cut of HVGO samples. Better agreement between the predicted and measured \n\nvalues was obtained, for the training and validation data sets, when the PLS model was \n\nused. As illustrated in Figure 6.27b, the training and validation data sets were closest from \n\nthe calibration line, compared to Figure 6.27a and Figure 6.27c, although the test data set \n\ncontinued to show larger deviations. Consequently, none of the models were able to predict \n\nthe 90% distillation cut of the HVGO samples and low quality models were achieved. To \n\nimprove these bad predictions more HVGO samples should be analysed. Only 23 samples \n\nat the test data set were not enough to obtain a good model. It is believed that in increasing \n\nthe number of samples, especially at the test data set, that better predictions will be \n\nachieved since improvements were obtained when increasing the database from 19 samples \n\nto 23 samples. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n270 \n \n\n a) \n\nb) \n\nc) \n\nFigure 6.27: Correlation between the experimental and predicted 90% distillation cut of the HVGO samples obtained by: \n\na) PCR, b) PLS and c) ANN models. \n\n480 \n\n490 \n\n500 \n\n510 \n\n520 \n\n530 \n\n540 \n\n550 \n\n560 \n\n480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\nis\nti\n\nll\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00baC\n\n) \n\nMeasured distillation (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n480 \n\n490 \n\n500 \n\n510 \n\n520 \n\n530 \n\n540 \n\n550 \n\n560 \n\n480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\nis\nti\n\nll\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00baC\n\n) \n\nMeasured distillation (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n480 \n\n490 \n\n500 \n\n510 \n\n520 \n\n530 \n\n540 \n\n550 \n\n560 \n\n480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 \n\nP\nr\ne\nd\n\nic\nte\n\nd\n d\n\nis\nti\n\nll\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n\u00baC\n\n) \n\nMeasured distillation (\u00baC) \n\ntraining + validation \n\ntest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n271 \n\n \n\nvii) 95% Distillation \n\nTo determine the distillation cut at 95%, 99 HVGO samples were analysed. From all \n\ndifferent 99 samples analysed, the training data set included 59 HVGO samples whereas \n\nthe validation and test data sets were composed by 20 HVGO samples, respectively. The \n\n95% distillation of all samples analysed varied between 500 to 558 \u00baC. From the \n\nmultivariate models used to predict the 95% distillation of the HVGO samples, PCR and \n\nANN models used the PCs as inputs while the PLS model was based on the original data. \n\nThe number of PCs considered by the principal component analysis was 13 PCs. These \n\nPCs were responsible for explaining 98.4% of the original data variance. When using the \n\nPLS model, 11 LVs were considered the most adequate to predict the 95% distillation cut. \n\nTaking into account the performance obtained for both training and validation data sets and \n\ntest data set, when applying the statistical performance indexes, it was possible to verify \n\nthat the developed models were not able to predict the 95% distillation of the HVGO \n\nsamples (Table 6.30). The results, in Table 6.30, showed that the use of PLS model led to \n\nslightly better results than the PCR and ANN models, contributing to achieve a good \n\nmodel for the training and validation data sets. Higher     value was obtained, for the \n\ntraining and validation data sets, when the PLS model was applied. Smaller     ,     \n\nand     results were also achieved when using the PLS model to predict the 95% \n\ndistillation of the HVGO samples. However, for the test data set, even the PLS model \n\nfailed. Moreover, all models were classified for presented insignificant coefficient of \n\ndetermination and higher errors for the test data set. Different approaches were tried to \n\nimprove the obtained results. A more critical selection of the inputs, like an outlier \n\nanalysis, to select the samples used as inputs of the applied models was made. In addition, \n\ndifferent models were performed by changing the samples incorporated in the different \n\ndata sets. However, the results obtained were even worse than the ones presented here. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n272 \n \n\nTable 6.30: Performance indexes achieved when using multivariate modelling during training, validation and test data \n\nsets, to predict the 95% distillation cut of HVGO samples. \n\n PCR PLS ANN \n\n \ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\ntraining and \n\nvalidation \ntest \n\n       0.18 -0.22 0.71 0.05 0.51 -0.07 \n    5.98 7.52 3.74 7.51 4.75 7.84 \n     8.38 10.3 4.94 9.08 6.45 9.64 \n    0.00 1.33 0.00 0.79 -0.14 0.25 \n      0.00 0.24 0.00 0.15 -0.03 0.05 \n    0.91 1.11 0.53 0.97 0.70 1.03 \n\nModel performance unsatisfactory unsatisfactory good unsatisfactory satisfactory unsatisfactory \n\n \n\n \n\nAs confirmed in Figure 6.28, that depicts the correlation plot of the measured and predicted \n\nresults with all models applied and for both data sets, low quality models were achieved \n\nindependently of the models applied.

Good predictions were obtained when using the PLS \n\nmodel for the training and validation data sets but bad predictions were achieved for the \n\ntest data set. The prediction of the 95% distillation of the HVGO samples was another case \n\nwhere more information should be given to the developed models in an attempt to improve \n\nthe obtained predictions. It was expected that the developed models should be able to \n\npredict the 95% distillation of the HVGO samples. However, unsatisfactory predictions \n\nwere obtained and such predictions could be related with: i) the distillation of the heaviest \n\nfractions, which were difficult to distillate; ii) the standard method used which was \n\ncharacterized as a limited and complicated method where the distillation was performed at \n\na reduced pressure and with just one theoretical plate; and iii) the reproducibility of the \n\nstandard method. Due to the higher reproducibility of the standard method it was possible \n\nthat small differences between the chemical composition of the samples were not \n\ndifferentiate with the distillation, as a consequence, different HVGO samples presenting \n\nthe same distillation results were obtained. As example, Figure 6.29 presents the HVGO \n\nsamples with the same distillation temperature (T=550 \u00baC) for the 95% distillation cut. \n\nApparently no differences were identified when comparing the \n1\nH NMR spectrum of each \n\nof the samples but analysing more carefully it was possible to conclude that samples with \n\ndifferences in the chemical composition were giving the same output value. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n275 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.29: Comparison between some HVGO samples presenting the same distillation temperature for the 95% \n\ndistillation cut (the spectrum of each HVGO sample was differentiate with different colours). \n\n \n\n \n\nIn Figure 6.30 it is clearly demonstrated that greatest differences between the HVGO \n\nsamples occurred around the 1.6 to 1.8 ppm, where some beta CH, CH2 and hydro-\n\naromatic appears. It will be possible to say that the spectra represented by the blue and \n\nmagenta colour were similar but different from the other two spectra which were also \n\npresenting some similarities between them. At the aromatic region (Figure 6.31) \n\ndifferences between the four HVGO samples were notorious, especially at the heaviest \n\naromatic region. The greatest differences were found between the 8.4 to 8.8 ppm were \n\nsome tri- and tetra-aromatic rings appears and around 7.6 to 7.8 ppm which was \n\ncharacterized for the presence of diaromatic and most of tri- and tetra-aromatic. Once again \n\nit was verified that the samples presented by the blue and magenta spectra were similar but \n\ndifferent from the other two. The similarities and differences between the presented spectra \n\ncould be the reason why weaker predictions were obtained and why the model couldn\u2019t be \n\nable to predict with higher accuracy the 95% distillation. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n276 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.30: Expansion of the aliphatic region of the \n1\nH NMR spectra of Figure 6.29 obtained in the 95% distillation cut \n\n(the spectrum of each HVGO sample was differentiate with different colours). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.31: Expansion of the aromatic region of the \n1\nH NMR spectra of Figure 6.29 obtained in the 95% distillation cut \n\n(the spectrum of each HVGO sample was differentiate with different colours). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n277 \n\n \n\n6.2.1.3.  HVGO \u2013 Final Remarks \n\n1\nH NMR spectroscopy in combination with different multivariate models was applied to \n\npredict the most important physical-chemical properties used to evaluate and characterize \n\nthe quality of the HVGO samples. Density, kinematic viscosity, carbon residue and \n\ndistillation were the properties analysed. As demonstrated, very good predictions were \n\nobtained for both data sets, training and validation data sets and test data set, when using \n\n1\nH NMR spectroscopy to predict the density, kinematic viscosity and carbon residue. \n\nThese results were very important and confirmed that \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy can be used \n\nalternatively to the traditional standard methods. The results showed (see Table 6.31) that \n\nthe use of PLS model led to more accurate results than PCR and ANN models when \n\npredicting the kinematic viscosity and carbon residue. However, when predicting the \n\ndensity, the application of the ANN model led to better performance indexes. \n\nThe prediction of the different distillation cuts were not achieved with high accuracy as \n\noccurred for the other properties analysed. However, the first distillation cuts analysed (5, \n\n10 and 50%) were possible to predict by \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy, where good predictions \n\nwere obtained. The use of the PLS model led to more accurate results when predicting the \n\n5 and 10% distillation cuts, whereas better performance indexes were achieved for the 50% \n\ndistillation cut when using the ANN model. Worse performances were obtained when \n\npredicting the 90 and 95% distillation cuts. The models failed when predicting the test data \n\nset of both distillation cuts. Good performance indexes were achieved when using the PLS \n\nmodel for the training and validation data sets of both distillation cuts (90 and 95%) \n\nwhereas, unsatisfactory results were obtained when predicting the test data set of both \n\ndistillation cuts (90 and 95%). Different approaches were tried in an attempt to improve the \n\nfinal results obtained, such as, the change of the samples that composed the different data \n\nsets. However, the results obtained were practically the same. The reason why the HVGO \n\ndistillation was not so well predicted perhaps can be justify with the chemical composition \n\nof the HVGO samples and the distillation results. It was verified, by analysing the \n1\nH \n\nNMR spectra, that in all HVGO samples collected, there were some different samples \n\ngiving similarity results at a given distillation cut. Consequently, the models were not able \n\nto predict the distillation of the HVGO samples with the expected accuracy. With the \n\nresults obtained, for the 5, 10 and 50% distillation cuts, it was possible to conclude that \n1\nH \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n278 \n \n\nNMR spectroscopy can also be used to predict the distillation of the HVGO samples. \n\nHowever, the performance indexes achieved, especially for the 90 and 95% distillation \n\ncuts, led to conclude that more information should be given to the develop models, \n\nsuggesting that increasing the number of samples, especially for the test data set, a further \n\nimprovement in the accuracy could be obtained. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.31: Results obtained for different properties of HVGO analysed when using \n1\nH NMR in multivariate models. \n\n   \n\nnumber \n\nPC \n\nnumber \n\nLV \n\ntotal \n\nvariance \n                              \n\nmodel \n\nperformance \n\nDensity \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n14 \n\n \n\n98.1% \n\n0.64 0.002 0.004 0.0000 0.00 0.60 satisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n-0.48 0.003 0.007 0.0008 0.09 1.22 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.76 0.002 0.003 0.0000 0.00 0.49 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.76 0.002 0.003 -0.0003 -0.03 0.49 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 11  \n0.73 0.002 0.003 0.0000 0.00 0.52 good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.28 0.003 0.005 0.0002 0.02 0.84 unsatisfactory \n\nKinematic \n\nviscosity \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n16 \n\n \n\n98.3% \n\n0.68 0.54 0.78 0.00 0.00 0.56 good \n\ntest \n \n\n-0.20 0.96 1.60 0.19 1.75 1.10 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.87 0.34 0.50 0.02 0.14 0.36 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.84 0.46 0.58 0.07 0.64 0.40 very good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 20  \n0.97 0.16 0.22 0.00 0.00 0.16 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.93 0.27 0.39 -0.12 -1.12 0.27 very good \n\nCarbon \n\nresidue \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n15 \n\n \n\n98.2% \n\n0.55 0.05 0.07 0.000 0.00 0.67 satisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.48 0.06 0.09 -0.030 -8.01 0.72 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.72 0.04 0.06 -0.001 -0.21 0.53 good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.71 0.06 0.07 0.001 0.35 0.54 good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 17  \n0.91 0.02 0.03 0.000 0.00 0.30 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.76 0.05 0.06 -0.003 -0.80 0.50 very good \n\nDistillation \n\n(5%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n13 \n\n \n\n98.3% \n\n0.18 8.08 10.03 0.00 0.00 0.90 unsatisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.29 7.86 9.63 -1.97 -0.51 0.84 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.62 4.55 6.85 -0.61 -0.16 0.62 satisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.55 5.49 7.64 -2.93 -0.76 0.67 satisfactory \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 10  \n0.75 4.06 5.53 0.00 0.00 0.50 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.66 5.54 6.67 -2.80 -0.73 0.58 good \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nnumber \n\nPC \n\nnumber \n\nLV \n\ntotal \n\nvariance \n                              \n\nmodel \n\nperformance \n\nDistillation \n\n(10%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n12 \n\n \n\n98.1% \n\n0.24 6.00 7.78 0.00 0.00 0.87 unsatisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.07 7.21 9.00 -0.51 -0.13 0.96 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.76 2.83 4.38 0.41 0.10 0.49 very good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.18 6.66 8.47 -1.46 -0.37 0.91 unsatisfactory \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 10  \n0.78 3.09 4.21 0.00 0.00 0.47 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.66 4.65 5.62 -0.20 -0.05 0.60 good \n\nDistillation \n\n(50%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n13 \n\n \n\n98.2% \n\n0.35 3.52 4.52 0.00 0.00 0.80 unsatisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.41 3.58 4.40 0.91 0.20 0.77 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.66 2.73 3.44 0.23 0.05 0.61 good \n\ntest \n \n\n0.72 2.58 3.00 1.00 0.22 0.52 good \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 13  \n0.90 1.41 1.82 0.00 0.00 0.32 very good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.54 2.95 3.86 1.08 0.24 0.68 satisfactory \n\nDistillation \n\n(90%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n12 \n\n \n\n98.1% \n\n0.25 4.78 6.70 0.00 0.00 0.86 unsatisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.20 5.23 7.01 0.81 0.15 0.89 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.58 3.81 5.02 0.25 0.05 0.64 satisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n0.50 4.32 5.55 -0.40 -0.08 0.71 unsatisfactory \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 12  \n0.75 2.92 3.85 0.00 0.00 0.50 good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.48 4.44 5.67 0.25 0.05 0.72 unsatisfactory \n\nDistillation \n\n(95%) \n\nPCR \ntraining and validation \n\n13 \n\n \n\n98.4% \n\n0.18 5.98 8.38 0.00 0.00 0.91 unsatisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n-0.22 7.52 10.3 1.33 0.24 1.11 unsatisfactory \n\nANN \ntraining and validation \n\n \n0.51 4.75 6.45 -0.14 -0.03 0.70 satisfactory \n\ntest \n \n\n-0.07 7.84 9.64 0.25 0.05 1.03 unsatisfactory \n\nPLS \ntraining and validation \n\n 11  \n0.71 3.74 4.94 0.00 0.00 0.53 good \n\ntest \n  \n\n0.05 7.51 9.08 0.79 0.15 0.97 unsatisfactory \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n281 \n\n \n\n6.3. LVGO, HVGO and Fuel Oil \u2013 Chemical Composition \n\nAlthough all the potentialities and advantages, previously demonstrated, of \n1\nH NMR \n\nspectroscopy to determine the properties of the different fractions analysed, LVGO, \n\nHVGO and fuel oil, the ability of \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy to analyse the chemical \n\ncomposition of such heavy fractions was assessed. The analysis of the molecular \n\ncomposition of these fractions could be considered a challenge once these heavy fractions, \n\nproduced by conversion of residues, were very complex, containing hundreds of individual \n\nhydrocarbons varying in size and molecular structure and functional groups. Moreover, the \n\nlarge amount of very similar molecules present in each fraction could lead to signals \n\noverlap. Due to the overlap that characterized the NMR peaks many of the structural detail \n\ninformation that the NMR spectrum might give may be lost and the identification of some \n\nmolecules impossible. However, some still are visible and NMR spectroscopy have been \n\ndemonstrated as a paramount technique for the determination of the: i) aromatic and \n\naliphatic content; ii) aliphatic CH3, CH2, CH and quaternary C; iii) aromatic CH and \n\nquaternary C; iv) H and C next to aromatic rings and farther away; and v) long aliphatic \n\nchains. With this, in order to analyse the chemical composition of such fractions besides \n\nthe use of \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy, that contained the molecular structure of all \n\nhydrocarbons contained in a petroleum cut, the quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy was \n\nalso used. The idea of using the quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectroscopy was to obtain more \n\ndetail information of the molecular structure. Table 6.32 and Table 6.33 present the \n\nassignment of bands in the \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectra, respectively. These chemical shift \n\nregions were selected taking into account some published works in the study of petroleum \n\nand derivatives (Altgelt et al., 1994; Molina V et al., 2007; Behera et al., 2008; Process \n\nNMR Associates LLC, 2012a; Process NMR Associates LLC, 2012b) and confirmed by \n\nthe 2D spectra obtained when analysing a petroleum fraction. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.32: Comparison between LVGO, HVGO and fuel oil by using \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy. \n\n Chemical shift range (ppm) Type of proton \nQuantification (%) \n\n \nLVGO HVGO Fuel Oil \n\nAliphatic \n\nregion \n\n0.5 \u2013 1.0 \nH in  -CH3 or farther from an aromatic ring; CH3 in \nparaffins \n\n29.4 19.1 18.8 \n\n1.0 \u2013 1.9 H in  -CH3,  -CH2 and  -CH    \n\n         1.0 \u2013 1.6 \n          H in  -CH2 and  -CH3 and farther from an \naromatic ring; CH and CH2 in paraffins \n\n51.3 55.6 47.6 \n\n         1.6 \u2013 1.9 \n          H in  -CH2 and  -CH and farther from an \naromatic ring \n\n5.6 8.5 6.2 \n\n1.9 \u2013 3.4  -CH3,  -CH2 and  -CH   \n \n\n           1.9 \u2013 2.25           H in  -CH3 2.7 3.7 4.4 \n\n         2.2 \u2013 2.8           H in  -CH2 5.6 5.7 9.8 \n\n         2.8 \u2013 3.4           H in  -CH2 and  -CH 0.9 2.8 3.5 \n\n3.4 \u2013 4.5 H in CH2 and CH   to aromatic rings 0.0 0.0 0.8 \n\nAliphatics 0.5 \u2013 4.5 aliphatic H 95.5 95.4 91.1 \n\nAromatic \n\nregion \n\n6.5 \u2013 7.3 monoaromatic H 2.7 1.8 3.5 \n\n7.3 \u2013 7.8 diaromatic H 1.8 1.8 3.5 \n\n7.8 \u2013 10.0 triaromatic H 0.0 1.0 2.6 \n\nAromatics 6.5 \u2013 10.0 aromatic H 4.5 4.6 9.6 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.33: Comparison between LVGO, HVGO and fuel oil by using \n13\n\n C NMR spectroscopy. \n\n Chemical shift \nrange (ppm) \n\nType of carbon \nQuantification (%) \n\n \nLVGO HVGO Fuel Oil \n\nAliphatic \n\nregion \n\n11.0 -15.0  -CH3 or farther from an aromatic ring 5.9 5.0 3.9 \n\n15.0 \u2013 18.0  -CH3 to an aromatic ring 1.7 2.5 1.3 \n\n18.0 \u2013 20.5 \n -CH3 shielded by one adjacent ring or group; some CH3   hydroaromatic and \nnaphthenic CH2 \n\n5.9 6.7 4.5 \n\n20.5 \u2013 22.5 CH3 not shielded by adjacent groups; some CH3   hydroaromatic and naphthenic CH2 7.6 6.7 5.2 \n\n22.5 \u2013 24.0 \n -CH2 and farther adjacent to terminal CH3;  -CH2 in unsubstituted tetralin structures; \nsome CH3   hydroaromatic and naphthenic CH2 \n\n2.5 2.5 1.3 \n\n24.0 \u2013 27.5 \nsome CH2 naphthenic;  -CH not shielded;  -CH2 in propyl side chains;  -CH3 in \nisopropyl side chains \n\n6.8 7.5 5.2 \n\n27.5 \u2013 37.0 \n\nCH2 not adjacent to CH in alkyl groups; CH2 adjacent to alkyl CH in some  -CH2 and \nCH2 adjacent to terminal CH3 in alkyl substituents with more than four carbons; some \n\nCH2 naphthenic; some ring joining methylene (32 \u2013 43 ppm) \n\n38.3 36.6 31.2 \n\n37.0 \u2013 60.0 \n\ninternal (bridgehead) naphthenic C or CH; CH in alkyl side chains (not isopropyl or \n\nisobutyl); CH2 in alkyl side chains adjacent to CH; some ring joining methylene (32 \u2013 43 \n\nppm) \n\n16.1 15.8 12.3 \n\nAliphatics 11.0 \u2013 60.0 aliphatic region 84.8 83.3 64.9 \n\nAromatic \n\nregion \n\n100.0 \u2013 115.0 some olefinic (other spread through aromatic region) 0.0 0.0 1.9 \n\n115.0 \u2013 129.5 protonated aromatic carbon atoms 9.3 7.5 18.2 \n\n129.5 \u2013 138.0  bridgehead aromatic carbon atoms 4.2 5.0 9.8 \n\n138.0 \u2013 160.0 substituted aromatic carbon atoms; heteroatom (N, O, S) aromatic 1.7 4.2 5.2 \n\nAromatics 100.0 \u2013 160.0 aromatic region 15.2 16.7 35.1 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n284 \n \n\nTaking into account the information given in Table 6.32, it was verified that, in general, \n\nthe results obtained from the analysis of the LVGO and HVGO spectra could not lead to \n\nany conclusion relatively to the aliphatic and aromatic hydrogen content, since similar \n\nresults of the aliphatic (0.5 \u2013 4.5 ppm) and aromatic (6.5 \u2013 10.0 ppm) hydrogens content \n\nwere obtained. As would be expected, higher differences were notable when comparing \n\nfuel oil with LVGO and HVGO samples. The aromatic content of the fuel oil samples were \n\nhigher, with the fuel oil samples richer in aromatic protons and having higher quantity of \n\nprotons that were present in mono-, di- and triaromatic structures. It was verified that the \n\nstrong increase in aromatic hydrogens of the fuel oil samples, related with the increase of \n\nthe aromatic ring number, was accompanied with an increase in the hydrogen\u2019s   and a \n\ndecrease in the hydrogen\u2019s   and  , compared with the quantities of these molecules in \n\nLVGO and HVGO samples. This behaviour was an indicative that fuel oil samples were \n\nricher in aromatic compounds and poor in aliphatic structures when compared with LVGO \n\nand HVGO samples. These results, obtained by \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy, were confirmed by \n\nthe analysis of the quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectra. As visualized in Table 6.33, fuel oil \n\nsamples were characterized for presenting higher quantity of aromatic carbon content and \n\nsmaller percentage of aliphatic carbon content, when compared with LVGO and HVGO \n\nsamples. The other most pronounced differences were related with the presence of some \n\nolefinic compounds (100.0 \u2013 115.0 ppm) and the higher percentage at the 138.0 to 160.0 \n\nppm at the \n13\n\nC NMR spectra. Olefins are rarely found in crude oils, the reason for which \n\nany evidence of these compounds were found in the \n13\n\nC NMR spectrum of LVGO and \n\nHVGO samples, however they may be present in substantial amounts in cracked refinery \n\nstreams. Since fuel oil was produced at the visbreaker unit and since during the visbreaking \n\nprocess there are some thermal cracking process occurring it is possible that, depending on \n\nthe severity conditions, some olefinic molecules were formed, as visualized in the \n13\n\nC \n\nNMR spectra. Relatively to the higher percentage at the 138.0 to 160.0 ppm, this could be \n\nrelated with the higher quantity of compounds bearing heteroatoms in the heavier fractions, \n\nsuch as fuel oil. The same occurs when comparing this region (138.0 \u2013 160.0 ppm) of the \n\nLVGO and HVGO spectra. It was known that HVGO samples presented higher quantity of \n\ncompounds with heteroatoms when compared with LVGO samples, thus explaining the \n\nhigher percentage of substituted aromatic carbon atoms at the HVGO samples. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n\n285 \n\n \n\nWhen comparing the \n1\nH NMR spectra of LVGO and HVGO samples, even though no \n\nconclusions were made relatively to the content of aromatic and aliphatic compounds, it \n\nwas possible to see that LVGO samples were richer in  -methyl hydrogen or farther away \n\nfrom aromatic rings, represented by the band at 0.5 to 1.0 ppm. These results were \n\nindicative that the LVGO samples were, probably, richer in long alkyl chains suggesting \n\nthat smaller quantity of aromatic compounds were found. Relatively to the aromatic region \n\n(6.5 \u2013 10.0 ppm), the results indicated that LVGO samples were richer in protons attached \n\nto single rings (6.5 \u2013 7.3 ppm) while HVGO samples had protons attached to single-ring \n\nand multiring aromatics. With this information, it was concluded that HVGO samples were \n\nricher in heavier aromatic compounds. The same conclusions were taken from the \n\nquantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectra. Moreover, with the quantitative \n13\n\nC NMR spectra it was \n\nconfirmed that LVGO samples presented long chains indicating higher quantity of longer \n\nparaffinic structures. The absorption of 11.0 to 15.0 ppm, which indicated  -CH3 groups or \n\nfarther away from an aromatic ring, allowed us to conclude relatively to the length of the \n\nalkyl chains. In addition, the region at 27.5 to 37.0 ppm, also suggested longer chains of \n\nLVGO samples once this band represents CH2 groups from aliphatic compounds. \n\nFurthermore, the higher results at 20.5 to 22.5 and 37.0 to 60.0 also indicated that there \n\nwas a contribution of long chains. At the aromatic region of the \n13\n\nC NMR spectra, the \n\nhigher percentage at 115.0 to 129.5 ppm suggested that LVGO samples presented more \n\nprotonated aromatics then HVGO samples indicating that the aromatic compounds in the \n\nLVGO samples were farther away from each other. Suggesting, once again, that HVGO \n\nsamples were composed with heavier aromatic compounds. Besides the heavier percentage \n\nof aromatic compounds, it was verified that the HVGO samples presented higher quantity \n\nof carbons attached to naphthenic compounds than LVGO samples, due to the higher \n\nresults at 18.0 to 20.5 and 24.0 to 27.5 ppm.  \n\nNMR, especially the combination of \n1\nH and \n\n13\nC NMR spectroscopy, demonstrated, once \n\nagain, to be a paramount technique in the structural characterization of such complex \n\nmixtures as LVGO, HVGO and fuel oil. The structural analysis of these spectra \n\ndemonstrated to be very useful for the knowledge of the chemical composition with the \n\nidentification of structural groups, such as, the paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic \n\ncompounds. The knowledge of the chemical composition can be very useful for the \n\ncomprehension of the influence of the nature of these petroleum fractions in the refinery \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n \n\n286 \n \n\noperations. For example, the nature of HVGO, an intermediate used as feedstock of the \n\nhydrocracking unit, influences the course of the reaction occurring during hydrocracking. \n\nMoreover, the chemical composition of LVGO, a portion of gas oil that is recovered at the \n\nvacuum unit and mixed with gas oil from the atmospheric unit, is also important once the \n\npresence of higher quantity of aromatic compounds can affect the quality of gas oil, \n\ndecreasing its cetane number, and cause environmental problems.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nCCOONNCCLLUUSSIIOONNSS  AANNDD  FFUUTTUURREE  \n\nWWOORRKK  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is presented in this chapter the final conclusions taken from the developed work \n\nas well as some suggestions for future work.

General Conclusions \n\nThe characterization of light vacuum gas oil, heavy vacuum gas oil and fuel oil by proton \n\nnuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was very important in the determination of \n\nsignificant physical-chemical properties for the complete assessment of their quality and \n\nfor process control. With this work, it was demonstrated that combining proton nuclear \n\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy with different multivariate methods (principal \n\ncomponent regression, partial least squares and artificial neural networks) it was possible \n\nto develop multivariate calibration models that had a high potential to predict the \n\nproperties of such petroleum fractions, even though these fractions were characterized as \n\nthe heavy ends of crude oils. Kinematic viscosity, density, carbon residue, P-value, sulfur \n\ncontent, distillation and flash point were example of some of the properties analysed and \n\nmost of them where determined with good precision and accuracy. \n\nNuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been suggested as one of the possible \n\ntechniques for industrial analysis and has already been used in some refinery laboratories. \n\nAs found in the literature, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can offer precise \n\nanalysis in real-time and control the properties of the crude from the feed to the final \n\nproduct. The greatest challenge is to verify the capability of a nuclear magnetic resonance \n\nspectrometer to monitor some properties and for process control. This is the motivation of \n\nthis work, to verify if a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer can be used to \n\npredict some heavy petroleum properties and consequently evaluate the possibility of \n\nacquiring an online nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer.  \n\nTo take advantage from all nuclear magnetic resonance benefits and to exploit the \n\nquantitative aspects of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy some pre-processing and \n\ndata manipulations of the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were necessary to be \n\nperformed. Phase and baseline correction, chemical shift alignment, data reduction, \n\nbinning, normalization and intensity scaling were the main pre-processing steps used. All \n\nthese different types of data pre-processing were considered important and necessary, due \n\nto the increased complexity and dimensionality of the nuclear magnetic resonance data, to: \n\ni) exploit the information content of the nuclear magnetic resonance data; ii) increase the \n\nprospect of detecting subtle changes in the nuclear magnetic resonance data; and iii) \n\nenhance the interpretability of the resulting multivariate models. From other approaches \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 7 \n \n\n290 \n \n\nfound in the literature, these data manipulations were considered the most adequate and the \n\nones that mostly contributed to significantly benefit of the analysis of nuclear magnetic \n\nresonance data. It was also important to have in attention that for obtaining a good \n\nquantitative spectrum some experimental factors need to be controlled and respected. \n\nAttention was also given to the sample preparation, data acquisition, pulse sequence and \n\ninstrumental parameters. \n\nThe impact of the pre-processing procedure, used before and after obtaining the spectrum, \n\ndemonstrated to be very important for further application of the multivariate data methods. \n\nPrincipal component regression, partial least squares and artificial neural networks were \n\nthe multivariate methods used to predict the physical-chemical properties of the petroleum \n\nfractions. The use of these multivariate methods proved to be very advantageous in the \n\ncharacterization of the petroleum fractions under analysis and enable the rapid computation \n\nof the physical-chemical properties prediction models. \n\nFor the light vacuum gas oil samples, the models were developed to predict the density and \n\nthe distillation at atmospheric pressure. For the heavy vacuum gas oil samples the same \n\ntype of models were used to determine the kinematic viscosity, density, carbon residue and \n\nthe distillation at reduced pressure. Finally, to predict the kinematic viscosity, density, \n\ncarbon residue, P-value, sulfur content and the flash point of the fuel oil samples more \n\nmodels were also developed. The development of all these models were only possible after \n\nthe samples underwent a characterization by following some standard methods and by \n\nusing the proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hundreds of samples of the \n\ndifferent streams were analysed with the standard methods and proton nuclear magnetic \n\nresonance spectroscopy and consequently a good data base was created. It was in this data \n\nbase that the different methods were applied and reliable models obtained. \n\nComparing the results obtained for the different petroleum fractions analysed, it was \n\nnotorious that the best results were obtained for all light vacuum gas oil properties due to \n\nits lower complexity, when compared with heavy vacuum gas oil and fuel oil samples.  \n\nWhen analysing light vacuum gas oil samples, proton nuclear magnetic resonance \n\nspectroscopy proved to have a higher potential to predict the density and the atmospheric \n\ndistillation, the two most important properties used to evaluate light vacuum gas oil \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \n \n\n291 \n\n \n\nquality. The results showed that the use of artificial neural networks model led to more \n\naccurate results, in almost all developed models. Very good predictions were obtained for \n\nboth data sets, training and validation data sets and test data set, and for all properties \n\nanalysed.  \n\nFor the heavy vacuum gas oil samples, it was possible to conclude that proton nuclear \n\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy had high potential to predict heavy vacuum gas oil \n\nproperties, such as density, kinematic viscosity and carbon residue. The higher problem \n\noccurs when predicting the distillation of the heavy vacuum gas oil samples. Good \n\npredictions were obtained when analysing the first distillation cuts (5, 10 and 50%), \n\nhowever, worse performances were achieved when predicting the 90 and 95% distillation \n\ncuts, especially for the test data set. The distillation of the heaviest fractions and the \n\nlimitations of the standard method used could contributed to the less accurate models \n\nachieved when predicting the 90 and 95% distillation cuts. Although, more information \n\nshould be given to the develop models, suggesting that increasing the number of samples, \n\nespecially for the test data set, a further improvement in the accuracy could be obtained. \n\nWhen analysing fuel oil samples, it was demonstrated that proton nuclear magnetic \n\nresonance spectroscopy had high potential to predict almost all properties analysed. \n\nAccurate results were obtained when predicting the kinematic viscosity, density, sulfur \n\ncontent, carbon residue and flash point. The most difficult property to predict was the P-\n\nvalue. Besides the good predictions obtained for the training and validation data sets, only \n\nsatisfactory predictions were achieved for the test data set. However, it is expected that \n\nincreasing the data set, i.e., the number of samples analysed, a further improvement in \n\naccuracy and robustness of the models could be obtained.  \n\nWhen comparing the applied multivariate models, it was demonstrated that, better \n\npredictive performance were obtained, for both data sets, when using the artificial neural \n\nnetworks and the partial least squares models. Worst predictions were achieved for all \n\nproperties analysed when using the principal component regression model. It was with the \n\nartificial neural networks model that better predictions were obtained, due to its ability to \n\ndevelop a model around non-linear relationships between the measured properties and the \n\npredicted results, and it was with the linear predictive model, principal component \n\nregression, that worst performance indexes were achieved. The partial least squares model \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 7 \n \n\n292 \n \n\nalso demonstrated to be a good model giving normally better predictions for the training \n\nand validation data sets. It was with the artificial neural networks model that most reliable \n\npredictions when determining the kinematic viscosity at both temperatures, 100 and 50 \u00baC, \n\nthe carbon residue, the flash point, the P-value and the density of fuel oil samples were \n\nachieved. Moreover, for the light vacuum gas oil samples, the artificial neural networks \n\nalso demonstrated higher quality models when predicting the density and the 5, 10 and \n\n90% distillation cuts. In addition, the artificial neural networks was more reliable to predict \n\nthe density and 50% distillation cut of heavy vacuum gas oil samples. On the other hand, \n\nthe partial least squares model confirmed greats capabilities to predict the sulfur content of \n\nfuel oil samples, the 50 and 90% distillation cuts of light vacuum gas oil samples and the \n\nkinematic viscosity, carbon residue and the 5 and 10% distillation cuts of heavy vacuum \n\ngas oil samples.  \n\nThe results obtained demonstrated that proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in \n\ncombination with multivariate data methods is a very important technique that can be used \n\nto predict the properties of light (light vacuum gas oil) or heavy fractions (heavy vacuum \n\ngas oil and fuel oil) with high accuracy and precision. In addition, using the proton nuclear \n\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy and the developed models will contribute to quantify all \n\nproperties analysed, almost replacing the standards methods and avoiding the tedious \n\nsample preparations used every day. \n\nProton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has proven to be a very important \n\ntechnique in the study of petroleum fractions and can become an alternative to the \n\ntraditional time-consuming laboratory methods. Using a nuclear magnetic resonance \n\nspectrometer, many benefits are expected to be obtained. It demonstrated to be a rapid and \n\nnon-invasive procedure, offering improvement in the analysis, reduction in the number of \n\nanalysis and unique ability to provide all control properties with just one analysis. This \n\nleads us to conclude that it will be advantageous to have an online nuclear magnetic \n\nresonance spectrometer to determine such properties. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \n \n\n293 \n\n \n\n7.2. Suggestions for Future Work \n\nConcerning the adequate results obtained when using \n1\nH NMR spectroscopy combined \n\nwith multivariate data methods to predict some properties of LVGO, HVGO and fuel oil \n\nstreams, it will be interesting to develop an extensive work with an increase number of \n\nsamples and of properties to demonstrate the interesting and benefits of nuclear magnetic \n\nresonance spectroscopy. \n\nSince the final results depend on the pre-measuring, pre-processing and data manipulations \n\nof the NMR spectra it will be a good practice to verify the effect of other approaches in the \n\nfinal developed models. It will be interesting to evaluate the use of other solvents during \n\nthe preparation of the samples for NMR analysis, such as, the use of an internal or external \n\nstandard. In addition, it will also be interesting to select which information of the spectrum \n\nshould be used depending on the property in analysis. \n\nBesides PCR, PLS and ANN models, other models, such those generated by genetic \n\nprogram and based on fuzzy logic should be employed to explore the potentialities of \n1\nH \n\nNMR spectroscopy in predicting the physical-chemical properties. In addition, other \n\nmethodologies to divide the information into the three different data sets, training, \n\nvalidation and test data sets, should be also tried. Moreover, other approaches of the \n\nmodels used should be explored, such as, the selection of other inputs, instead of using all \n\nselected PCs, when applying the ANN model. \n\nTo improve the performance indexes obtained with the developed models it will be \n\nadvisable to increase the data base with more quantity of samples analysed. This will \n\ncontribute to increase the precision and accuracy of the developed models to predict all \n\nproperties under analysis. In addition, it will be required a continuous maintenance and \n\nupgrade of these developed models to ensure that the models continues to predict with high \n\nprecision the required properties. This ensures that even occurring significant changes in \n\nthe process, the models will be prepared to respond with a good accuracy.  \n\nTo verify all results obtained it will be useful to implement an online \n1\nH NMR \n\nspectrometer to characterize such properties of light vacuum gas oil, heavy vacuum gas oil \n\nand fuel oil streams and to develop the multivariate models based on this information. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\nRREEFFEERREENNCCEESS  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n \n\n297 \n\n \n\nAbdi, H., 2003.

The objective of this economic study was \n\nto verify the profitability of the acquisition of an online NMR spectrometer. For this \n\neconomic evaluation more information should be included, but only the information here \n\npresented was the one given by both entities involved, Matosinhos refinery and Qualion \n\nCompany. Taking into account the information given by Qualion Company (The Qualion \n\nCompany, 2006), a quotation for the entire project would be about                    . \n\nThis investment includes: i) NMR analyzer installation; ii) commissioning and training \n\nremote PC for remote diagnostic; iii) assistance sample system; iv) shelter house; and v) \n\nproject management. It excludes the piping, infrastructure and the humidity and \n\ntemperature control, which should be prepared and acquired by the refinery. However, \n\nthese last necessities are low cost when compared with the initial investment. Thereby, the \n\ntotal investment cost was estimated to be about         . \n\nAs already mentioned, the online monitoring of fuel oil properties can contribute to: i) \n\ndecrease the quantity of cutter stocks used in the production of fuel oil; ii) produce fuel oil \n\nwith the desired properties; and iii) avoid product loss. Taking into account the quantity of \n\nfuel oil produced, the quantity of cutter stocks required and the blending of fuel oil at the \n\ncollecting tank, it would be possible to save about 5 a 7 $/t when a good production and \n\noptimum blending are obtained. Considering that the production of fuel oil is around 1600 \n\nt/day and fuel oil is produced during 333 days in a year (excluding some days when for \n\nsome reason the production of fuel oil is interrupted) it will be possible to save \n\n                          .  \n\nAs the initial investment is around                    , the payback time of the initial \n\ninvestment will be approximately 3 months. This payback time is a highly attractive \n\ninvestment return. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 8 \n \n\n318 \n \n\nAppendix B: Copyright Permissions"}]}}}
