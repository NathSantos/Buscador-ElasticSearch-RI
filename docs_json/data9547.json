Introduction\n\n The modern society has experi-\nenced a constant and inevitable dilemma \nregarding reduction in use of non-\nrenewable resources and the adoption \nof cleaner technologies. Thus, the oil \nindustry has invested in new technolo-\ngies, such as the technique of hydraulic \nfracturing or fracking in order to reduce \nfinancial and labor costs, and maximize \n\nthe production of hydrocarbons, par-\nticularly natural gas. The first references \nconcerning hydraulic fracturing was \nreported in l947 in a sedimentary rock \nfield of oil in the United States and some-\ntime after (in 1954) in the former Soviet \nUnion. Currently, this methodology is \nused extensively in several producing \nfields in order to stimulate hydrocarbon \n\nreservoirs (SILVA et al., 2002). This \ntechnique allows an increase in the \nproductivity of an oil well, doubling or \neven quadrupling rate of productivity. \nData from the United States show that \nthe use of this methodology expanded \nrapidly after 2005, when the EPA (U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency) \nauthorized the use of the hydraulic frac-\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0370-44672014670168\n\n\n\n374 REM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(4), 373-378, oct. dec. | 2014\n\nPerspectives for use of hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas production\n\nturing. Since this date, there has been \na significant increase in the number of \n\nwells drilled (WENZEL, 2012). Table \n1 shows the evolution of the production \n\nof shale gas in the USA in the period \n2000-2010.\n\nYear Shale gas production\n\n2000 0.1\n\n2001 0.2\n\n2002 0.25\n\n2003 0.3\n\n2004 0.4\n\n2005 0.55\n\n2006 0.7\n\n2007 1.3\n\n2008 2.2\n\n2009 3.25\n\n2010 4.3\n\nTable 1\nU. S. shale gas production\nover the last decade (1012 ft3)\n\nSource: WENZEL (2012)\n\nIn North America, almost 70% \nof the natural gas production will be \nproduced by hydraulic fracturing in \nthe near future. Hydraulic fracturing \nand horizontal drilling apply the most \nadvanced technologies and are economi-\ncally the most viable in terms of oil and \ngas recovery from the shale rocks. In \nthe United States, 45% of the domestic \n\nproduction of natural gas and 17% of oil \nproduction would not have been recov-\nered (in a period of 5 years) if hydraulic \nfracturing had not been used. (THE \nROYAL SOCIETY, 2012). Shale min-\neral deposits such as Bakken, Barnett, \nMontney, Haynesville, Marcellus and \nsome recently denominated ones such \nas Eagle Ford, Niobrara and Utica have \n\nbeen drilled, completed and fractured \nusing this method (McNutt, 2011). Hy-\ndraulic fracturing is being currently used \nin 90% of oil and natural gas wells in the \nUnited States (WENZEL, 2012). Table \n2 shows an estimate of mineral reserves \n( in 1012 ft3) that can be recovered by \nusing hydraulic fracturing technique all \nover the world.\n\nTable 2\nEstimate of hydrocarbons \nreserves technically recoverable by \nusing hydraulic fracturing technique all \nover the world (in 1012 ft3)\n\nSource: WENZEL (2012)\n\nCountry Reserves technically recoverable by fracking\n\nChina 1275\n\nUSA 862\n\nArgentina 774\n\nMexico 681\n\nSouth Africa 485\n\nAustralia 396\n\nCanada 388\n\nLibya 290\n\nAlgeria 231\n\nBrazil 226\n\nPoland 187\n\nFrance 180\n\nNorway 83\n\nChile 64\n\nIndia 63\n\nParaguay 62\n\nPakistan 51\n\nUK 20\n\nHowever, there are many uncer-\ntainties about the environmental damage \nof this methodology and mainly about \nthe harmful effect that hydraulic frac-\nturing may have on the environment as \na whole including the surrounding eco-\nsystems (MCNUTT, 2011). According \nto WELLE (2013) hydraulic fracturing \n\nis yet a very controversial theme world-\nwide. Some European countries such as \nIreland, Czech Republic, Romania, Ger-\nmany and Spain have recently declared a \n\"moratorium\" relating to the use of this \nmethodology. In Brazil, the Brazilian \nPetroleum Agency - ANP- is nowadays \nmonitoring these issues, and several Non-\n\nGovernmental Organizations (NGO's) \nare also discussing this theme in their \nagenda. The non-governmental agency \nGreenpeace has officially pronounced \nitself to be against the use of the method. \n\nHydraulic fracturing is a stimu-\nlation technique used to increase the \nproductivity of oil wells which basically \n\n\n\n375\n\nCarlos Mouallem et al.\n\nREM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(4), 373-378, oct. dec. | 2014\n\nconsists of injecting a pressurized fluid \ninto the rock formation (around the well) \nin order to create new pathways to fa-\ncilitate the hydrocarbon flow in the well.\n\nA key element for successful hy-\ndraulic fracturing is a properly con-\nstructed well. During the drilling and \ncompletion process, appropriate tech-\nniques should be used to isolate the \ngroundwater to avoid damages to the \nreservoir and to the well.\n\nThe more critical aspects of a well \nconstruction are the selection and ap-\nplication of the appropriate casing and \ncementation. To provide the necessary \nprotection, three steps are usually taken \ninto account to isolate the well interval \nof rock that has been penetrated during \n\nthe drilling process.\nIn the phase I, a drill hole is made \n\nuntil the base of the soil or unconsolidat-\ned material. A steel casing or conductor \ntube is inserted into the hole and cement-\ned in place. At this stage, an artificial \nbarrier is automatically created to prevent \nthe mixture of fluids, gravels and sands \nand to avoid the falling of these materials \ndown in the hole. The well is then drilled \nuntil the depth defined by the regulatory \nagencies (EPA in the USA) obeying envi-\nronmental aspects. This depth is gener-\nally below the base of groundwater and \nin a region of the rock mass with rocks of \ngood quality. In phase II, a second set of \nsteel casing (surface casing) is cemented \nto the interior of the well throughout \n\nthe entire perforated vertical interval. \nIn phase III, the well is drilled until the \ntotal depth. In some cases, depending \non the total depth and azimuth of the \nwell, a set of linear intermediary casing \ncan be inserted and cemented into the \nwell. Once the well is drilled until the \ndepth of the intersection zone contain-\ning the hydrocarbon, other steel tubes \nare inserted into the well. The second (or \nthird) set of tubes is usually cemented in \nplace to isolate the hydrocarbon zone. In \nsome cases, the covering is cemented in \nplace and above the intersection zone to \navoid damage to the oil formation. Figure \n1 shows an example of the construction \nof a well for application of the hydraulic \nfracturing technique.\n\nFigure 1\nExample of hydraulic\n\n fracturing for shale development\n\nDuring the productive life of an \noil well interventions are always neces-\nsary to maintain or even improve the \nproductivity. Thus, the technique of \nhydraulic fracturing has been presented \nas an exceptional alternative in terms of \nproductivity improvement and costs re-\nduction. In the oil industry stimulation \noperations such as hydraulic fracturing, \nare widespread. However, due to the dif-\nferent characteristics of each formation \nor project, not all wells are suitable to \nbe stimulated. Thus, within the same \noil field, wells may be or not may be \nundergoing this type of operation.\n\nAlthough the operations of well \nstimulation are practiced frequently, \n\nthe problem of selecting wells is still \nrelevant and is increasingly gaining \nimportance in the current mineral \nscenario. The process of selecting wells \nfor stimulation involves the analysis \nof various parameters and depends on \ntechnological resources. An incorrect \ninterpretation of the parameters of the \nwell or a failure in the planning of the \noperation may cause serious conse-\nquences in the production of an oil field. \nThe use of hydraulic fracturing of a rock \nformation with success is still a great \nchallenge to mining and petroleum engi-\nneers. Several researches has been made \nin the last decade using artificial intel-\nligence techniques to map existing data \n\nand build productive artificial systems \nin order to try to maximize the results of  \nspecific mine operations. Nevertheless, \nit should be noted that there is still no \nconsensus among specialists regarding \nthe use of this technology.\n\nMany researchers allege that this \nmethod can offer various risks to the \nenvironment. Experts warn that among \nthe main environmental impacts are \ncontamination of water and soil, risk \nof explosion because of methane gas \nrelease, excessive water consumption, \nand use of chemical products in the flu-\nids used in the technique. Some techni-\ncians also attest that this technique can \nindirectly induce tectonic movements.\n\n\n\n376 REM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(4), 373-378, oct. dec. | 2014\n\nPerspectives for use of hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas production\n\n2. Some definitions\n\nHydraulic fracturing is a stimu-\nlation technique used to increase the \nproductivity of oil wells. This technique \nis the most effective treatment for sand-\nstone layers found in older and con-\nsolidated sediments. The main reasons \nfor the increase of productivity of this \ntechnique are restructuration of the flow \nmodel, improvements in the rock mass \npermeability and possibility of reaching \ndistant areas with better permeability \nand more porous conditions. In naturally \nfractured and lenticular reservoirs, this \ntechnique facilitates the interconnection \nbetween the parts. The physical principle \nof this technique consists in an injection \nof a special fluid at very high pressure in \nthe reservoir rock, changing the state of \ntension in the rock mass and provoking \nthe opening and or/ expansion of the \nexisting fractures or discontinuities of \nthe original rock mass. To sustain the \n\nopenings, a supporting agent is injected \nto maintain the fractures open, creating \nartificial permeability. This process is \ndone specially in oil fields that have al-\nready reached their peak of production \nor have low permeability, thus presenting \na low recovery factor.\n\nThe technique is described as fol-\nlows: a hydraulic fracturing is formed by \npumping a fracturing fluid into the well \nat a pressure high enough to increase \nthe pressure in the well, exceeding the \nfracture gradient (pressure gradient) of \nthe rock mass. The fracture gradient is \ndefined as the increase in pressure per \nunit of depth, due to the specific weight \nof rocks and is usually measured in \npounds per square foot or bar per meter. \nThe fracture must be sufficiently perme-\nable to allow the flux of formation fluids \ninto the well. Formation fluids include \ngas, oil, salt water, fresh water and other \n\nfluids introduced into the formation dur-\ning fracturing. The hydraulic fracturing \nequipment used in oil fields and natural \ngas generally consists of a mud mixer, \none or more high pressure devices, large-\nvolume pumps and a monitoring unit. \nAuxiliary equipment includes tanks, one \nor more units for storage and propellant \nhandling, a chemical additive unit (used \nto accurately monitor chemical addi-\ntion), low pressure tubes, and devices \nto evaluate fluid density and pressure. \nThe fracturing equipment operates over \na vast range of pressures and injection \nrates, and can reach up to 100 MPa \n(15,000 psi) and 265 liters per second \n(100 barrels per minute). Due to its high \nrate of success and financial return, hy-\ndraulic fracturing treatments are usually \nperformed as soon as the drilling phase \nis made and a low permeability of the \nreservoir rock formation is confirmed.\n\n3. Potential for gas exploration in Brazil\n\nThe International Energy Agency \n(IEA) classifies Brazil in 10th position \nin the ranking of the world's largest \nreserves of shale gas. \n\nThe Brazilian Agency of Petroleum \nmade a public auction for shale gas \nexploration on November 28, 2014. \nOn this occasion ANP designated 240 \nblocks for shale gas exploration in a \ngroup of 7 geological basins. The geo-\nlogical basins available in this auction \n\nwere: Parecis, Parna\u00edba, Rec\u00f4ncavo, \nParan\u00e1, S\u00e3o Francisco, Acre and Ser-\ngipe. As a result, only 72 blocks were \nauctioned including 49 to Petrobras.\n\nAccording to an ANP evaluation, \nthis method can certainly increase the \nproduction of natural gas in Brazil, but \nas yet, it still has high costs and complex \noperations to be adapted in the country \nover the next years (WELLE, 2013).\n\nANP data demonstrate the use \n\nof conventional hydraulic fracturing \noperations in Brazil since 1950. These \ndata reveal that more than six thousand \noperations were performed using low \npressures and flow rates without severe \nincidents. These data also reveal what \nthe Brazilian experience lacks in terms \nof high pressures and volumes, as is \nthe case of the USA where shale gas \nrepresented more than 20% of the gas \nproduction in 2010 (WELLE, 2013).\n\n4. Results\n\nThe image profiles are similar to \n\"photographs\" of the wall well and are \nbased on the resistive and acoustic char-\nacteristics of the rock formations. The \nanalysis of these images generate much \ninformation to be used in reservoir char-\nacterizations, such as layer inclination, the \noccurrence of fractures and discontinuities \nin general, underground landslides, mag-\nnitude and direction of in situ stresses, \nlithology, geological discordances, areas \nwith thin layers, low porosity and under-\nground caves. This information can thus \nbe used in conjunction with other profiles, \n\nsamples and production reports to model \nthe reservoirs (F\u00c9LIX ET AL., 2008).\n\nLAGE et al. (2012) executed a study \nrelated to the exploitation of unconven-\ntional gas in view of the American experi-\nence, and analyzed the perspectives for the \nmarket for the Brazilian reality. Based on \nthis study, they concluded that the uncon-\nventional reserves mapped in Brazil must \nplay a very important role in the energetic \nmatrix of the country, considering that \nthe reserves are located onshore and can \ncontribute to the gas market, internalizing \nthe use of gas all over the country.\n\nGomes et al. (2005) described a gel \nbased on non-ionic surfactants used for \nhydraulic fracturing.\n\nSANTOS AND CORADESQUI \n(2013) made an analysis of the economic \nviability of shale gas production based \non the case of Fayetteville, in the United \nStates. The authors concluded that the \nadditional costs due the use of hydraulic \nfracturing can be high. Considering the \ngas prices of 2013 the profitability of new \nprojects for the production of shale gas in \nthe United States was questioned by the \nreferred authors.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThere are only a few studies related \nto hydraulic fracturing as an alternative \nto conventional exploitation of hydrocar-\n\nbons in Brazil.\nHydrocarbons frequently accumu-\n\nlate in an oil trap after the geological \n\nprocesses of formation and migration. \nThe reservoir is the portion of this trap \ncontaining oil and gas that is hydrauli-\n\n\n\n377\n\nCarlos Mouallem et al.\n\nREM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(4), 373-378, oct. dec. | 2014\n\ncally connected and forms a unified \nsystem. The reservoir rock, in principle, \ncan have any origin or nature, but to \nconstitute a reservoir, the rocks must \npresent voids (porosity) and these voids \nmust be interconnected to provide the \nadequate permeability (SANTOS AND \nCORADESQUI, 2013). As referred to by \nthe aforementioned authors, conventional \nreservoirs rocks are porous and permeable \nreservoirs that contain fluids of low and \nmedium viscosity. Sandstones and lime-\nstone are typical examples of conventional \nreservoir rocks.\n\nHigh costs and complexity produc-\ntion in the oil industry has stimulated the \ndevelopment of new techniques to substi-\ntute the conventional methods. Hydraulic \nfracturing is an excellent example of an \nunconventional method because it allows \noil and gas extraction from some wells \nthat would be economically unviable by \ntraditional methods.\n\nAccording to American Society of \nPetroleum Engineers, around 2.5 million \nprocedures of hydraulic fracturing were \ndone worldwide, of which one million \n\nwere only in the United States of America. \nFurthermore, tens of thousands of hori-\nzontal wells have been drilled in the last \n60 years (WOOD AND ROJAS, 2000).\n\nAccording to GROTHER (2000) \nhis technique has great economic and \nsocial potential for hydrocarbon pro-\nduction in the USA. The main benefits \nwould be more profits for landowners, \noil companies and investors, together \nwith the creating of more jobs. (FELIX \nET AL., 2008). \n\nMost environmentalists believe that \nthe most significant environmental risks \nare the contamination of groundwater \ndue the opening of an unsuccessful well \n\u201cblowouts\u201d, generating leaks and spills \nof wastewater and chemicals. In their \ndefense, oil companies argue that the \nmethod of hydraulic fracturing has been \nused safely for decades (SANTOS AND \nCORADESQUI, 2013).\n\nAnother public concern is the earth-\nquakes. Seismic monitoring is an essential \ntool to ensure that hydraulic fracturing in-\nduces micro-seismic activity (only within \nthe reservoir to be explored). The society's \n\nconfidence in the safety of hydraulic frac-\nturing would be higher with a systematic \nseismic monitoring and publication of \nthe results for the inhabitants (SANTOS \nAND CORADESQUI, 2013). Although \nthe process of hydraulic fracturing creates \na large number of micro-seismic events or \nmicro tremors in the earth, the magni-\ntudes of these are too small to be detected \nat surface. The larger micro-earthquakes \nhave a magnitude of only about 1.6 on \nthe Richter scale (FERNANDES, 2008). \n\nAnother important environmental \nimpact is related to the fluids used in the \nstimulation process. The fluids used in \nhydraulic fracturing are typically com-\nposed of more than 98% of water and \nsand. The other reagents are chemicals \nused as thickeners and friction reducers \nto protect the casing. Preventive measures \nshould be taken to avoid that these chemi-\ncals impact surface water and soil during \ntransportation, storage and disposal. The \nusual percentages of the substances in \nthe stimulation fluid are water and sand \n(99.51%), and other chemical additives \nin general (0.49 %) as listed in Table 3.\n\nTable 3\nFluids composition\n\nof the hydraulic fracturing\n\nSource: DOE &amp; GWPC (2009)\n\nSolution Percentage\n\nWater and sand 99.51\n\nAcid 0.123\n\nPetroleum distillate 0.088\n\nIsopropanol 0.085\n\nPotassium chlorid 0.06\n\nGuar gum/hydroxyethyl cellulose 0.056\n\nEthylene glycol 0.043\n\nSodium/Potassium carbonate 0.011\n\nSodium chloride 0.01\n\nBorate salts 0.007\n\nCitric acid 0.004\n\nDimethyl form amide 0.002\n\nGlutaraldehyde 0.001\n\nIndustries, regulatory agencies \nand environmentalists believe that these \nproblems can be solved with the use of \nthe best practices of exploration, drilling \nand exploitation. Thus, researches and \ninvestments in new technologies, to-\ngether with monitoring and strict regula-\n\ntions, are essential. Certainly, the major \nchallenge for all involved in the shale gas \nand oil production in the coming future \nwill be to ensure the protection of the \nenvironment, health and public safety \nwhile the shale exploitation increases \n(SANTOS AND CORADESQUI, 2013). \n\nThe United States is the best example \nand has been successfully applying this \ntechnique for decades.\n\nThe main economic advantages of \nthis method are high productivity, job \nopportunities, and increased income for \nthe whole society, among others.\n\n6.
