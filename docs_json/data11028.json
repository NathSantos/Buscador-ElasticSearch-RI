The KPg mass extinction is commonly attributed to the Chicxulub impact, but in the \n\nlast decades it has been linked to the Deccan volcanism. The abrupt warming during the PETM is \n\nattributed to methane release from seafloor sediments as consequence of the ocean warming due to the \n\nNorth Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) volcanic activity. The mechanisms by which these magmatic \n\nevents led to global climate changes are still poor constrained. A recent approach combining rock \n\nmagnetic techniques and mineralogical data provided interesting benchmarks to identify period of iron \n\noxides dissolution linked to environmental acidification. Here, magnetic techniques such as magnetic \n\nsusceptibility and isothermal remanent magnetization are applied to two marine sections encompassing \n\nthe KPg (Zumaia, Spain) and PETM (Egypt, GSSP) transitions, in order to provide new insights to \n\nidentify period of severe environmental changes in the geological record and their link to magmatic \n\nactivity.  \n\nThe magnetic results obtained for both sections, Zumaia and Dababiya, correlate with biostratigraphic, \n\nmineralogical and geochemical data from previous studies at different sections worldwide, \n\ndemonstrating not only the reliability of the data as well as the global dimension of both events. The \n\ndata obtained for Zumaia supports an important climate event preceding the KPg boundary. Volcanic \n\nmarkers like magnetite dissolution previously identified in Bidart and Gubbio are confirmed here in the \n\ncase of the Zumaia section. Magnetite depletion also corroborates the presence of akagan\u00e9ite and \n\nMercury at Zumaia to support the volcanic theory. On a global scale, these markers correlate with global \n\nwarming, an increase in atmospheric CO2, environmental acidification via acid rains and presence of \n\nhigh stress opportunistic planctik foraminifera blooms. This climate perturbation also corresponds to the \n\nage of the main Deccan eruptions, recently dated by U-P method on zircon, reinforcing the link with the \n\nDeccan traps. In contrary to the KPg transition, the PETM at Dababiya is characterized by an increase \n\nin magnetite content, which is interpreted as the dissolution of carbonate and relative enrichment in \n\ndetrital materials (clays). In addition, high concentration of goethite is observed along the section, \n\nspecially above the PETM, where an increase in biological productivity is observed (Khozyem et al., \n\n2015). In the PETM interval goetite decreases considerably. Goethite content at Dababiya is interpreted \n\nas the diagenetic oxidation of pirite and thus an indicator of anoxia during PETM. The increase in \n\nmagnetite and decrease in goethite at the PETM also correlates with higher ratios of V/Cr, indicative of \n\nanoxic conditions (Khozyem et al., 2015). The high magnetite/low goetite interval at Dababiya also \n\ncorrelates with the Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE) minimum that characterizes the PETM and with a \n\ncalcite and foraminifera disappearance, supporting an ocean acidification starting below the PE \n\nboundary. Mercury enrichments in the same interval, together with negative excursions of 187Os/188Os, \n\nsupports the role of volcanism (NAIP) to initiate the concomitant warming and sea level rise that mark \n\nthe PETM.  \n\nComparasion of the magnetic properties of the KPg and PETM highlight different climate processes: \n\ndissolution of detrital magnetite onland in the case of KPg point environmental acidification by acid \n\nrains, whereas ocean acidification due to methane release and subsequent carbonate dissolution \n\ncharacterized the PETM. These findings provide new clues to identify climate and environmental \n\nacidification in the geological record and improve our understanding of future anthropogenic climate \n\nchanges. \n\nKey-Words: Cretaceous-Paleogene Mass Extinction, Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, \n\nEnvironmental Magnetism, Paleoclimate changes, Acidification. \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n\n \n\nResumo \n\nAo longo da sua evolu\u00e7\u00e3o, a Terra tem experienciado importantes mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas que por vezes \n\nocorrem de forma gradual ao longo de milh\u00f5es de anos, mas por outras, de forma abrupta e repentina a \n\nescalas de tempo mais curtas, deixando marcas severas no registo geol\u00f3gico. Este projeto foca-se em \n\ndois grandes eventos clim\u00e1ticos da hist\u00f3ria da Terra: a extin\u00e7\u00e3o em massa do Cret\u00e1cico-Paleog\u00e9nico \n\n(KPg) e o pico t\u00e9rmico do Paleoc\u00e9nico-Eoc\u00e9nico (PETM), ocorridos h\u00e1 aproximadamente 66 e 56 Ma, \n\nrespetivamente.   \n\nO final do per\u00edodo Cret\u00e1cico \u00e9 assinalado pela segunda maior extin\u00e7\u00e3o da hist\u00f3ria da Terra, que levou \n\nao desaparecimento de dois ter\u00e7os das esp\u00e9cies existentes (Courtillot, 2003). As mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas \n\nque est\u00e3o na origem desta extin\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam sido apontadas como sendo resultado de dois grandes eventos \n\ncatastr\u00f3ficos distintos, mas que ocorreram no mesmo curto espa\u00e7o de tempo: o impacto meteor\u00edtico de \n\nChicxulub (M\u00e9xico) e as erup\u00e7\u00f5es vulc\u00e2nicas do Dec\u00e3o (\u00cdndia). A contribui\u00e7\u00e3o, individual ou conjunta, \n\nde cada um destes eventos para a extin\u00e7\u00e3o em massa \u00e9 ainda um assunto controverso e de intenso debate \n\ndentro da comunidade cient\u00edfica. \n\nA teoria do impacto meteor\u00edtico, formulada por Alvarez et al. (1980), al\u00e9m da ocorr\u00eancia global de um \n\nn\u00edvel de Ir\u00eddio, \u00e9 suportada pela exist\u00eancia de uma enorme cratera na Pen\u00ednsula do Yucat\u00e1n datada do \n\nfinal do Cret\u00e1cico e ainda, pela ocorr\u00eancia de microtectites, quartzo de impacto e espinelas ricas em Ni \n\nem diversos dep\u00f3sitos do KPg. Contudo, esta teoria n\u00e3o explica a natureza seletiva da extin\u00e7\u00e3o e a sua \n\nvariabilidade geogr\u00e1fica bem como o decr\u00e9scimo da diversidade de esp\u00e9cies observado antes da \n\nfronteira Cret\u00e1cico-Paleog\u00e9nico (Keller et al., 1993, 1995, 2011). Ainda assim, esta teoria continua a ser \n\na mais aceite, especialmente fora da comunidade cient\u00edfica, devido \u00e0 sua grande popularidade.  \n\nNa \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, as erup\u00e7\u00f5es do Dec\u00e3o t\u00eam sido grande alvo de estudo por parte de diversos autores \n\n(Chenet et al. 2007; Font et al., 2011; Keller et al., 2014; Schoene et al., 2014; Renne et al., 2015), os \n\nquais mostraram existir uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o clara entre o princ\u00edpio da extin\u00e7\u00e3o e o vulcanismo. Na verdade, a \n\nprov\u00edncia magm\u00e1tica do Dec\u00e3o constitui um dos maiores epis\u00f3dios vulc\u00e2nicos da hist\u00f3ria da Terra. \n\nEstima-se que as escoadas tenham coberto uma \u00e1rea de 1,5 milh\u00f5es de km2 e que tenham sido expelidos \n\n1,2 milh\u00f5es km3 de lava (Keller, 2014). Data\u00e7\u00f5es recentes com base nas raz\u00f5es U-Pb em zirc\u00f5es e \n40Ar/39Ar em plagi\u00f3clases mostraram que as erup\u00e7\u00f5es do Dec\u00e3o ter\u00e3o sofrido uma transi\u00e7\u00e3o de um \n\nper\u00edodo de elevada frequ\u00eancia/baixo volume para um per\u00edodo de erup\u00e7\u00f5es de baixa frequ\u00eancia/elevado \n\nvolume, durante o qual 80-90% do total das erup\u00e7\u00f5es ter\u00e1 ocorrido num espa\u00e7o de tempo muito curto \n\n(753 \u00b1 38 kyr), o qual n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 permitido um reequil\u00edbrio por parte dos ecossistemas terrestres levando \n\n\u00e0 extin\u00e7\u00e3o do final do Cret\u00e1cico (Schoene et al., 2014; Renne et al., 2015).  \n\nTal como no KPg, tamb\u00e9m o intervalo que acompanha a transi\u00e7\u00e3o do PE \u00e9 assinalado por mudan\u00e7as \n\nambientais globais e abruptas. No final do Paleoc\u00e9nico, a Terra ter\u00e1 sofrido um aumento bastante \n\nsignificativo da temperatura tendo o oceano profundo atingido um aumento de 6\u00baC e o oceano superficial \n\num aumento entre 5 e 8\u00baC (Zachos et al., 2006; Saleh, 2013). Este pico t\u00e9rmico do Paleoc\u00e9nico-Eoc\u00e9nico \n\n(PETM) coincide com uma anomalia (-2 a -7\u2030) da raz\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica de carbono (?13C), o que mostra ter \n\nexistido um input r\u00e1pido de uma grande quantidade de 13C no sistema oceano-atmosfera. Tal, ter\u00e1 levado \n\na uma intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o do efeito de estufa e, consequentemente, ao aquecimento global do planeta. O pico \n\nt\u00e9rmico do PE gerou uma s\u00e9rie de desequil\u00edbrios entre os ecossistemas terrestres levando \u00e0 altera\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\npadr\u00f5es globais de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o, circula\u00e7\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica e oce\u00e2nica, ao aumento da salinidade, \n\ndiminui\u00e7\u00e3o do pH e do oxig\u00e9nio dissolvido na \u00e1gua dos oceanos e, ainda, \u00e0 extin\u00e7\u00e3o de algumas esp\u00e9cies \n\nde foramin\u00edferos bent\u00f3nicos e a uma diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o de alguns foramin\u00edferos planct\u00f3nicos (Alegrete t al., \n\n2009; Luciani et al., 2007). \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\nA teoria mais aceite para explicar o PETM \u00e9 a de que o vulcanismo associado \u00e0 abertura do Atl\u00e2ntico \n\nNorte ter\u00e1 provocado um aumento da temperatura dos oceanos, conduzindo \u00e0 destabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de clatratos \n\npresentes nos sedimentos marinhos, libertando quantidades catastr\u00f3ficas de metano. A liberta\u00e7\u00e3o deste \n\nmetano ter\u00e1 levado \u00e0 acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos oceanos e contribu\u00eddo para o aumento do CO2 atmosf\u00e9rico. Apesar \n\nde o aquecimento global atual estar a acontecer a taxas superiores \u00e0s verificadas no PETM, as \n\nsemelhan\u00e7as entre estes dois eventos tornam o PETM um bom an\u00e1logo para testar modelos clim\u00e1ticos \n\nde previs\u00e3o das altera\u00e7\u00f5es atuais. \n\nUma abordagem recente que combina dados de mineralogia com as propriedades magn\u00e9ticas das rochas \n\ntem-se mostrado eficaz no reconhecimento de per\u00edodos de dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3xidos de ferro durante \n\nepis\u00f3dios de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental. Neste projecto s\u00e3o aplicadas t\u00e9cnicas magn\u00e9ticas em duas sec\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nmarinhas do KPg e PETM, Zumaia (Espanha) e Dababiya (Egipto), respectivamente: (1) suscetibilidade \n\nmagn\u00e9tica (SM), que permite avaliar a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de part\u00edculas dia-, para- e ferromagn\u00e9ticas; (2) \n\ndepend\u00eancia da suscetibilidade face \u00e0 frequ\u00eancia (Kfd), que permite averiguar a presen\u00e7a de part\u00edculas \n\nultrafinas (<0.03?m), t\u00edpicas de processos de altera\u00e7\u00e3o em carbonatos; (3) magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o remanescente \n\nisot\u00e9rmica (IRM), a qual permite diferenciar os principais minerais ferromagn\u00e9ticos presentes numa \n\ndada amostra; e, por \u00faltimo (4) curvas de revers\u00e3o de primeira ordem (FORC), utilizadas neste trabalho \n\npara averiguar a exist\u00eancia de biomagnetite. \n\nLitologicamente, a sec\u00e7\u00e3o de Zumaia alberga sedimentos hemipel\u00e1gicos de idade Maastrichtiana, \n\nessencialmente margas intercaladas com diversos dep\u00f3sitos turbid\u00edticos, e Daniana, fundamentalmente \n\ncalc\u00e1rios. Em Dababiya, os sedimentos Paleoc\u00e9nicos formam maioritariamente margas e xistos \n\nmargosos enquanto os sedimentos do Eoc\u00e9nico formam essencialmente, argilitos ou margas com uma \n\nforte componente silt\u00edtica.  \n\nOs resultados magn\u00e9ticos obtidos para ambas as sec\u00e7\u00f5es correlacionam-se com dados biostratigr\u00e1ficos, \n\nmineral\u00f3gicos e geoqu\u00edmicos de diferentes sec\u00e7\u00f5es do globo, demonstrando n\u00e3o s\u00f3 a confiabilidade dos \n\ndados como tamb\u00e9m a dimens\u00e3o global dos dois eventos. Os dados mostraram existir uma forte rela\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nentre a SM e a litologia, indicando que a SM \u00e9 essencialmente controlada pelo balan\u00e7o entre o input \n\ndetr\u00edtico e a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de carbonatos.  \n\nOs resultados de Zumaia mostram uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o da magnetite (detr\u00edtica e biog\u00e9nica) \n\nnum intervalo que se estende desde os 50 cm antes da fronteira KPg at\u00e9 aos primeiros cent\u00edmetros do \n\nDaniano. Estes resultados corroboram estudos anteriores desenvolvidos em Gubbio e Bidart, onde um \n\nintervalo de baixa SM e uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o no conte\u00fado em magnetite foram tamb\u00e9m detetados abaixo da \n\nfronteira do KPg (Lowrie et al., 1990; Font et al., 2011, 2014; Abrajevitch et al., 2015). Diversos proxies \n\ncomo a akagan\u00e9ite, Hg, CO2 atmosf\u00e9rico, paleotemperatura e \n187Os/188Os da \u00e1gua dos oceanos, \n\nrelacionam o intervalo de baixa SM encontrado em Zumaia com um epis\u00f3dio de vulcanismo intenso \n\nque, de acordo com as data\u00e7\u00f5es recentes (Schoene et al., 2014; Renne et al., 2015) ter\u00e1 correspondido \n\nao vulcanismo do Dec\u00e3o. A atua\u00e7\u00e3o de chuvas \u00e1cidas, resultantes do intenso vulcanismo, explica a \n\ndissolu\u00e7\u00e3o da magnetite detr\u00edtica e a ocorr\u00eancia de uma acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental que, por sua vez, ter\u00e1 \n\ncontribu\u00eddo para altera\u00e7\u00f5es na qu\u00edmica da \u00e1gua e/ou nos sedimentos, destabilizando o limite \u00f3xico-\n\nan\u00f3xico e, consequentemente, o desenvolvimento de magnetite biog\u00e9nica. Os resultados magn\u00e9ticos de \n\nZumaia corroboram a exist\u00eancia de um importante evento clim\u00e1tico ocorrido durante o final do \n\nMaastrichtiano, mostrando que a extin\u00e7\u00e3o poder\u00e1 ter tido inicio antes do impacto meteor\u00edtico.  \n\nAo contr\u00e1rio da transi\u00e7\u00e3o do KPg, a sec\u00e7\u00e3o do PETM em Dababiya \u00e9 caracterizada por um aumento do \n\nconte\u00fado de magnetite, o qual \u00e9 interpretado como resultado da dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o de carbonatos e aumento \n\nrelativo das componentes detr\u00edticas. Ao longo de toda a sec\u00e7\u00e3o, existe uma grande concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ngoetite, especialmente acima do intervalo do PETM, onde \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m observado um aumento da \n\n\n\n \n\nvi \n\n \n\nprodutividade biol\u00f3gica (Khozyem et al., 2015). No intervalo do PETM a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de goetite \u00e9 \n\nbastante menor. Em Dababiya, esta goetite foi interpretada como sendo resultado da oxida\u00e7\u00e3o da pirite \n\ne mostrou ser um bom indicador de anoxia durante o PETM. O aumento de magnetite e diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ngoetite no PETM correlacionam-se com elevados valores da raz\u00e3o V/Cr t\u00edpicos de condi\u00e7\u00f5es an\u00f3xicas \n\n(Khozyem et al., 2015). O intervalo de elevada magnetite/baixa goetite correlaiona-se ainda com os \n\nvalores m\u00ednimos da excurs\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica de carbono que caracteriza o PETM e com o desaparecimento \n\nde calcite e foramin\u00edferos, corroborando a ocorr\u00eancia de uma acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental com in\u00edcio antes \n\nda fronteira Paleoc\u00e9nico-Eoc\u00e9nico. Anomalias de merc\u00fario apresentadas neste trabalho em conjunto \n\ncom excurs\u00f5es negativas da raz\u00e3o 187Os/188Os reportadas em sedimentos marinhos no Atl\u00e2ntico Norte, \n\ncorroboram o papel do vulcanismo (NAIP) como mecanismo desencadeador do aumento de temperatura \n\ne aumento do n\u00edvel m\u00e9dio do mar que marcam o in\u00edcio do PETM. \n\nA compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre propriedades magn\u00e9ticas do KPg e do PETM sugerem diferentes processos \n\nclim\u00e1ticos: no caso do KPg, a dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o da magnetite detr\u00edtica no continente aponta para a ocorr\u00eancia \n\nde acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental devido \u00e0 actua\u00e7\u00e3o de chuvas \u00e1cidas, enquanto no PETM se verifica apenas \n\nacidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do oceano devido \u00e0 liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de metano, o que ter\u00e1 levado \u00e0 dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o de carbonatos. \n\nEstas novos dados oferecem pistas importantes para identificar eventos de acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o no registo \n\ngeol\u00f3gico e tamb\u00e9m novas pistas para compreender as futuras altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas do Antropoc\u00e9nico.  \n\nPalavras-chave: Extin\u00e7\u00e3o em Massa do Cret\u00e1cico-Paleog\u00e9nico, Pico T\u00e9rmico do Paleoc\u00e9nico-\n\nEoc\u00e9nico, Magnetismo Ambiental, Altera\u00e7\u00f5es Paleoclim\u00e1ticas, Acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n\n \n\nContents \n\nFigures List ........................................................................................................................................... viii \n\nTables List ............................................................................................................................................... x \n\nAcronyms List ........................................................................................................................................ xi \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nThe Earth temperature and weather patterns changed naturally over time scales ranging from decades, \n\nto hundreds of thousands, to millions of years (Ruddiman, 2008). In some cases, these changes are \n\ngradual but in others abrupt. This project focuses on the two global and abrupt climate changes that \n\noccurred at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (KPg) and at the Paleocene-Eocene (PE) transitions, at \n\napproximately 66 and 56 Ma, respectively.    \n\nThe KPg boundary is marked by a clay layer that points out the end of the Mesozoic and the beginning \n\nof the Cenozoic Eras. In the end of Cretaceous period, an abrupt climatic event occurred, leading to the \n\nextinction of the dinosaurs, several mammals, ammonites and many other terrestrial and marine species \n\nincluding a considerable number of smaller and less familiar organisms that constitute the marine \n\nplankton. This severe mass extinction is the second largest in Earth history, where two-thirds of the \n\nspecies were extincted (Courtillot, 2003).  \n\nTwo catastrophic events, the Chicxulub asteroid impact and the Deccan Traps eruptions, have been \n\nassociated to the climate changes that culminated in the KPg mass extinction. However, how each of \n\nthese catastrophes contributed to the mass extinction, either by itself or in combination, and whether \n\nthey were coincident in time are still under debate (Abrajevitch et al., 2015; Keller, 2014).  \n\nThe impact theory, formulated by Alvarez et al. (1980), became very popular after the discovery of an \n\nIridium and other platinum-group elements anomaly in deep-sea limestones exposed in Italy, Denmark \n\nand New Zealand. According to the author, the impact of a large Earth-crossing asteroid would inject \n\nabout 60 times the object\u2019s mass into the atmosphere as pulverized rock. A fraction of this dust would \n\nremain in the stratosphere for several years and would be then distributed worldwide. The resulting \n\ndarkness would suppress photosynthesis leading to a great mass extinction (Alvarez et al., 1980). This \n\nhypothesis is supported by the presence of impact-derived microtektites, shocked quartz grains and Ni-\n\nrich spinels in KPg boundary deposits, as well as the discovery of a giant impact crater on the Yucat\u00e1n \n\nPeninsula, Mexico. Some authors (Smith &amp; Hertogene, 1980; Schulte et al., 2010) have claimed the \n\nChicxulub impact to be the only cause for the mass extinction. However, despite the existence of such \n\napparently obvious coincidence, this hypothesis fails to explain the selective nature of the mass \n\nextinction, its geographically variable patterns, and a long-term decline in species diversity prior to the \n\nKPg boundary (Keller et al., 1993, 1995, 2011).  \n\nTherefore, due to its huge magnitude, some scientists pointed the Deccan volcanism as the main cause \n\nof the extinction (Courtillot et al., 1986; Keller et al., 2012). Moreover, three of the five big mass \n\nextinctions in Earth\u2019s history are consequence of large and rapid volcanic eruptions (Permian-Triassic, \n\nTriassic-Jurassic, and end-Devonian), suggesting that large igneous provinces (LIP) could have been \n\nthe general cause of mass extinctions (Courtillot &amp; Renne, 2003). Actually, the LIP of Deccan is one of \n\nthe major volcanic episodes in Earth\u2019s history, covering most of India with an estimated superficie of \n\n1.5 million km2 and 1.2 million km3 of extruded lava. Today, with about two thirds eroded or buried, the \n\nlava exposures still cover an area the size of France (Keller, 2014).  \n\nSeveral factors such as the popularity of the impact theory, the belief that Deccan volcanism occurred \n\nover a long period (leaving sufficient time for recovery between eruptions) and the absence of data that \n\ndirectly linked the mass extinction with Deccan volcanism in India made the acceptance of Deccan \n\nvolcanism as the cause (or at least the major contributor) for the mass extinction very challenging. \n\nHowever, the intense research of LIP\u2019s over the last few years, especially on the Deccan Traps, provided \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nnew insights about the role of volcanism in the KPg extinction (Abrajevitch et al., 2015; Punekar et al., \n\n2016; Chenet et al., 2007, 2008, 2009; Font et al., 2011, 2014, 2016; Keller et al., 2008, 2009a, 2009b, \n\n2009c, 2011, 2012).  \n\nDetailed paleomagnetic studies combined with 40K/40Ar (Chenet et al., 2007, 2008, 2009) of Deccan \n\nlava flows revealed three main volcanic phases of relatively short durations (Figure 1.1): Phase-1, -2 \n\nand -3 with a respectively mean age of 67.5 Ma, 65\u00b10.3 Ma, and 64.7 Ma. Phase-2, is indicated to be \n\nresponsible for nearly 80% of the total Deccan eruptions and to occur in a very short period (just a few \n\nhundred thousand years, or less) coincident with the KPg boundary, suggesting that Deccan volcanism \n\nhad a major role in the end-Cretaceous mass extinction (Chenet et al., 2007, 2008, 2009). However, age \n\nuncertainties of such data are larger than the estimated total duration of Deccan Traps and thus, the onset \n\nand duration of volcanism cannot be precisely compared to geological, extinction or environmental \n\nrecords from sedimentary sections spanning the KPg. Based on U-Pb dating zircon Schoene et al. (2014) \n\ncalculated a duration of 753 \u00b1 38 kyr for an estimated 80-90% of the total eruptive volume of the Deccan \n\nTraps, with age uncertainties 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than previous works. More recently, \n\nRenne et al. (2015) combined 40Ar/39Ar dating of igneous plagioclase with U-Pb zircon dating from \n\nSchoene et al. (2014) and suggest that Deccan volcanism did not had three different phases but a \n\ntransition from high-frequency, low-volume eruptions to low-frequency, high-volume eruptions instead. \n\nThe closer temporal coincidence of such transition and the Chicxulub impact (50 kyr) suggest that strong \n\nseismic waves produced by the impact could have triggered increased volcanism (Renne et al., 2015). \n\nThe cumulative effect of these huge and rapid volcanic eruptions may have led to global climate and \n\nenvironmental changes by the injection of stratospheric acid aerosols, ozone depletions, acid rain and \n\nsuperficial ocean acidification. The critical global effects induced by the Deccan are not expected to \n\nhave occurred at the onset of the first eruptions, but at the time when increased eruption rates and \n\nvolumes reached a critical threshold, starting to affect climate, the environment and life on Earth (Font \n\net al., 2018). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Relative thickness of Deccan lava flows in each of three phases of volcanic eruptions calculated by Chenet et al. \n\n(2007) as percent of total Deccan Trap thickness. Ages are based on paleomagnetic time scale. (Keller, 2014).   \n\nThe huge volumes of lava and specially the enormous sulphur content released were more than able to \n\nlead to the KPg extinctions (Chenet et al., 2007). However, the Chicxulub asteroid impact theory should \n\nnot be disregarded. Only the KPg extinction coincides with both a large impact and one of the largest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\nvolcanic episodes in Earth\u2019s History, which makes it difficult to distinguish the role of each event. Some \n\nauthors believe that each process is unlikely to have caused a global biological collapse individually, \n\npreferring a scenario of multiple causes (Keller et al., 2009; Renne et al., 2013). The main challenge for \n\nthe scientific community is to separate the consequences of these two coeval events. In addition, the \n\ntiming of both catastrophic event is too short to be elucidated by radiometric dating but can be \n\ninvestigated in the stratigraphic record. In several sections worldwide. Keller et al. (2011) show \n\nsignificant changes in planctik foraminifera, including dwarfing and test dissolution, in the Upper \n\nMaastrichtian CF1 and CF2 biozones, just below the Iridium-rich layer, and interpreted as the result of \n\nocean acidification linked to the Deccan traps activity. In Bidart and Gubbio, Font et al., (2014, 2016) \n\nshow that the presence of a low magnetic susceptibility interval, including mercury anomalies and \n\npresence of akagan\u00e9ite, in the CF1 biozone, consistent with environmental acidification induced by \n\nDeccan traps eruptions. Abrajevitch et al. (2015) showed that the low magnetic susceptibility interval \n\nin Bidart and Gubbio corresponds to a drastic decrease in detrital magnetite and biogenic magnetite \n\nformed by magnetotatic bacteria, interpreted as the result of dissolution by acid rain onland and change \n\nin seawater chemistry, respectively. These data suggest that the climate perturbations induced by the \n\nDeccan traps initiated shortly before the Chicxulub impact. However, this hypothesis has now to be \n\ntested in other sections, as it is the objective here in Zumaia. \n\nThe interval near the Paleocene-Eocene transition at 55.8\u00b10.2 Ma (Westerhold et al., 2009), also known \n\nas Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), is marked by global and sudden environmental \n\nchanges. Isotopic data revealed that a rapid warming started in the late Paleocene, with deep sea \n\ntemperatures rising 6\u00baC and sea surface temperatures rising at least 8\u00baC in the poles and 5\u00baC in the tropics \n\n(Zachos et al., 2006; Saleh, 2013). Precipitation and vegetation patterns dramatically altered worldwide, \n\nand both atmospheric and oceanic circulation were perturbed (Foreman et al., 2012). \n\nThis abrupt global warming, firstly recognized by Kennet and Stott (1991), is marked by a large (-2 to \n\n-7\u2030) negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in marine and terrestrial sediments (Kender et al., 2012). \n\nThis negative shift in the carbon isotope ratio (?13C) reflects a rapid release of 13C-depleted carbon into \n\nthe ocean-atmosphere system due to a massive and rapid injection of greenhouse gases (CH4 and/or \n\nCO2). The approximate mass of Carbon released has been estimated to be more than 2000 Gt (Dickens \n\net al., 1997) and possibly as high as 4500 Gt (Zachos et al., 2005).  \n\nThe most acceptable scenario to explain the PETM event is the catastrofic methane release from \n\nclathrates. Solid clathrates, contain 13C-depleted methane and water and, are stored in deep-sea \n\nsediments along the continental margin where its stabilization as hydrate requires high pressure and \n\nrelatively low temperature. A small increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure or a sea level change \n\nis enough to destabilize the clathrates which might escape from the seafloor and be rapidly oxidized to \n\nCO2 in the water column or atmosphere. The most likely cause for the destabilization of clathrates in \n\nthe  PETM was an ocean warming due to the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) volcanism. An \n\nenormous input of mantle-derived carbon linked to the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean is also \n\npossible because evidence exist for massive volcanism close to the PETM . However, it remains \n\nuncertain whether volcanism could have produced CO2 at a rate recquired for rapid global environmental \n\nchange (Sluijs et al., 2007).  \n\nOther scenarios have been proposed to explain the massive injection of CO2 in both marine and \n\natmospheric ecosystems such as (1) the extensive burning of Palaeocene peat and coal deposits linked \n\nwith the arid period that prevailed during the latest Palaeocene; (2) the release of thermogenic methane \n\nfrom Cretaceous-Paleocene mudstones in the North Atlantic, linked to hydrothermal injection in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\norganic-rich sediments; (3) the drying of isolated epicontinental seas, leading to dessication and rapid \n\noxidation of organic matter and (4) melting of the methane-rich permafrost (Khozyem et al., 2013).  \n\nThe environmental perturbations associated with the global temperature rise, such as increasing sea \n\nwater salinity and drop in pH and dissolved oxygen, led to major species extinctions (35-50%) in deep \n\nmarine benthic foraminifera (Alegret et al., 2009), but diversification in planktic foraminifera with \n\nsubtropical affinities (Luciani et al., 2007). In the terrestrial realm, it led to the diversification of modern \n\nmammal species and their migration across the northern continents (Bowen et al., 2002). The PETM is \n\nalso marked by an increase in kaolinite content in marine sediments throughout the Tethys region, which \n\nwas associated with a change to warm and humid conditions that would have led to the intensification \n\nof chemical leaching (Bolle et al., 2000). Because the length of time taken to form kaolinite is 106 years, \n\nKemp et al. (2016) indicates the kaolinite anomaly to be the result of an intensified hydrological regime \n\nthat caused extensive erosion of pre-existing kaolinite-bearing soils and regolith (Kemp et al., 2016).  \n\nThe mechanism and rate by which the excess of carbon was removed from the atmosphere and oceans \n\nis ambiguous and is still under debate (Bains et al., 2000; Torfstein et al., 2010). One of the most \n\nproeminent hypothesis is that the termination of the PETM crisis was a response to a sharp increase in \n\nthe intensity of the marine and terrestrial biological productivity, resulting in the drawdown of \n\natmospheric CO2 and subsequent carbon sequestration in the ocean (Bains et al., 2000). However, \n\nTorfstein et al. (2010) showed that the export production did not rapidly remove excess carbon from the \n\natmophere and indicated the silicate wethering as the most likely mechanism for carbon removal, which \n\noperates at much lower rates. \n\nThe PETM and KPg warming have been caused by a sudden greenhouse gas emissions, similary to \n\ntoday\u2019s anthropogenic warming. Although the current warming has been running at much faster rates, \n\nthe ressemblances between these events make the KPg and specially the PETM excellent analogues to \n\ntest modelling studies in order to forecast the actual climate change. In contrast to the KPg sections \n\nwhere rock magnetic properties provide interesting indicators or environmental accidification, rock \n\nmagnetism has been poorly tested in the case of the PETM hitherto. \n\nThis project aims to apply environmental magnetic methods such as magnetic susceptibility (MS) and \n\nisothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) on reference marine sections encompassing the KPg and PE \n\ntransitions at Zumaia (Spain) and Dababiya (Egypt), respectively. The applied techniques will provide \n\nnew insights to identify periods of severe environmental change (acidification) in the global sedimentary \n\nrecord as well as new constrains about the origin and timing of both climate events. Furthermore, the \n\nstudy of the PETM and KPg sections will bring insight into the response of the Earth\u2019s climate to the \n\nanthropogenic carbon emissions expected in the near future. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n2. Geological Setting and Sampling \n \n\n2.1 The KPg transition at Zumaia (Spain) \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 A) Location map of the studied area in the Basque-Cantabric basin.

Position of the KPg and 29r/29n \n\nchron boundaries are also shown. (Modified from Font et al., 2018). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nThe Zumaia section is located in the Basque country at the Bay of Biscay and it crops out at the Itzurun \n\nbeach (42\u00ba18.00\u2019N/ 2\u00ba15.30\u2019W) in north-western Spain, slightly north of Zumaia village (Figure 2.1 A, \n\nB). The Zumaia area is structurally a part of the synclinorium of Bilbao and sedimentologically it forms \n\npart of the Basque-Cantabric basin (Ten Kate &amp; Sprenger, 1993). The Basque-Cantabric basin was a \n\ndeep-water E-W trending interplate trough (flysch trough), flanked by shallow shelf areas to the north \n\n(Aquitania), south (Iberia) and east (Pyrenees), and opening westward into the Bay of Biscay (Dinar\u00e8s-\n\nTurrel et al., 2013).  This interplate trough was formed in the Early Campanian, as smaller basins from \n\nprevious rifting stages joined at the start of the Pyrenean convergence (Batenburg et al., 2012). \n\nThroughout the Late Maastrichtian and Paleocene the sea transgressed the shallow flanking areas, \n\nleading to the development of extensive ramps, or carbonate platforms. This wholesale transgression \n\nalso mades it difficult for coarse-grained siliciclastic deposits to reach the deep trough, which became \n\nthe site of a hemipelagic limestone/marl type of sedimentation (Dinar\u00e8s-Turrel et al., 2013). In a major \n\ntectonic phase during the Eocene (40-50 Ma), when the African and European continents collided, the \n\nsedimentary pile of the basin was folded and faulted but the stratigraphic sequences are easily \n\nrecognizable in the field (Ten Kate &amp; Sprenger, 1993; P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2012). \n\nThe Zumaia section, as the Bidart and the Hendaye coastal sections (Figure 2.1B), consists of Late \n\nCretaceous to Early Paleogene thick hemipelagic sequences of alternating marls and limestones, \n\ndeposited at an estimated water depth of 800-1500 m, in which a minor amount of turbidites are \n\nintercalated (Batemburg et al., 2012). These coastal cliffs form a classical site for paleo, magneto, bio \n\nand cyclostratigraphic studies. The alternation between marls and limestones in the sequences \n\nunderlying and overlying the KPg boundary was attributed to astronomical cycles in the Milankovitch \n\nband. Several cyclostratigraphic studies focusing on physical and geochemical parameters in \n\ncombination with detailed biomagnetostratigraphic analysis, identified precession cycles of 21 kyr, short \n\neccentricity cycles of 100 kyr, long eccentricity cycles of 405 kyr, obliquity modulation cycles of 1.2 \n\nMyr and very long eccentricity modulation cycles of 2.8 Myr (Payros et al., 2016). \n\nThe Maastrichtian succession at Zumaia is about 240 m thick, very well exposed and stratigraphically \n\ncontinuous. The bulk of the Maastrichtian strata corresponds to the Zumaia-Algorri Formation in which \n\nfour main lithofacies can be recognized: 1) marls, which can be thinly bedded to massive, and vary in \n\ncolor from reddish or purple to brown, depending on the burial and diagenetic history of the section; 2) \n\nlimestone-marl rhythmites of varying thickness, but with most couplets attaining thickness of 30 cm or \n\nless; 3) massive limestones; and 4) isolated distal turbidites interbedded with the above lithologies, \n\nwhich can occur as either single or multiple distal turbidites (Ward and Kennedy, 1993). \n\nBased on the varying proportions of these lithologies, two different lithological classifications were \n\nproposed. Wiedmann (1988) subdivided the Maastrichtian strata exposed at Zumaia into three main \n\nassemblages: (1) a lower Maastrichtian turbidite assemblage, deposited during an interval of increased \n\nsubsidence (P\u00e9rez-Rodrigu\u00e9z et al., 2012); (2) a middle turbidite assemblage of turbidites grading \n\nupward into limestone-marl sequences and (3) an upper Maastrichtian sequence characterized by \n\nrelative tectonic stability (P\u00e9rez-Rodrigu\u00e9z et al., 2012) containing interbedded marls and more resistant \n\nlimestones. These three subdivisions were further subdivided into 12 lithological units (Figure 2.2). \n\nOnly unit 12 is part of the sampled section (Figure 2.1C).  \n\nOn the other hand, Ward &amp; Kennedy (1993) divided the Maastrichtian strata into five formal members \n\nfrom the lowest (I) to highest (V): \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n- Member I is 90 m thick and it is composed of thin couplets of limestone and marl with bed thicknesses \n\nusually between 5 and 15 cm. In the lower parts of the member, thin interbedded distal turbidites occur. \n\nThis member corresponds to Wiedmann\u00b4s Units 2-5.  \n\n- Member II is 15 m thick and is composed of thick massive micritic limestones which show bed \n\nthicknesses averaging 0.2-0.4 m, with the thickest beds approaching a meter in thickness. These \n\nlimestones differ from the limestones above and below by the virtual lack of interbedded marls. This \n\nmember corresponds to Wiedmann\u00b4s Unit 6 and it forms the most prominent marker unit in the Zumaia-\n\nAlgorri Formation.  \n\n- Member III corresponds to Wiedmann\u00b4s Unit 7 and it is composed almost entirely of very thinly bedded \n\nmarl units with occasional thin distal turbidites. The color range is distinctive, from red to purple, \n\nappearing to be diagenetically controlled and related to depth of burial. This member is about 10-25 m \n\nthick, deeply eroded, and contains numerous faults.  \n\n- Member IV is composed of grey limestones interbedded with marls. The limestones can reach up to 1 \n\nm thick but are generally thinner. Member IV is a limestone-marl member, with 80 m in thickness, \n\nwhich varies in appearance depending on the amount of limestones. In the lower part of the member, \n\nthe rhythmicity is predominated by limestones, so that the unit is massive and usually well exposed in \n\nsteep cliffs. This limestone-dominated portion of the member corresponds to Wiedmann\u00b4s Units 8 and \n\n9 and it is succeeded by a marlier portion (Wiedmann\u2019s Unit 10), resulting in more recessive coastlines. \n\nAn upper, again more massive, calcareous portion makes up the top of the member and it corresponds \n\nto Unit 11 of Wiedmann. \n\n- Finally, Member V corresponds to Wiedmann\u00b4s Unit 12 making up the highest Maastrichtian strata in \n\nthe Bay of Biscay region. It contains the sampled section and it is composed of massive reddish and \n\nsporadically grey marls with some single sandy turbidites interbedded (Font et al., 2018). This member \n\nis about 15 m thick at Zumaia and it contains a very small calcareous component.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Panoramic view of the outcrop in the Punta Aitzgorri cliffs, showing the 12 lithological units proposed by \n\nWiedmann (1988). P\u00e9rez-Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2012). \n\nThe KPg boundary was specifically established at the base of the dark clay layer in the El Kef section \n\n(Tunisia). It is a yellowish red thin bed with relevant evidence of a meteorite impact. Although the KPg \n\nboundary clay layer is not present, the impact extinction event is very well recorded at Zumaia where \n\nthe lithological boundary between the Maastrichtian and the Danian is marked by a level of secondary \n\ncalcite (Mel\u00e9ndez &amp; Molina, 2008; Font et al., 2018). \n\nImmediately following the KPg transition, during the Danian, there was an even more dramatic \n\nreduction in siliciclastic influx into the basin which resulted in the deposition of pink coccolith \n\nlimestones (Ward &amp; Kennedy, 1993). The Danian stage is about 50 m thick at Zumaia and its sediments \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nbelong to the Aitzgorri and Itzurun Formations. Only Aitzgorri Fm is part of the sampled section. These \n\nFormations are mainly composed of regular alternations of hemipelagic indurated limestones, \n\nmarlstones and marls. In the Aitzgorri Fm the limestones dominate, whereas in the Itzurun Fm, the \n\nproportions of the three lithologies vary considerably. In addition, both formations include minor but \n\nsignificant amounts of thinbedded turbidites. The transition between the two formations is marked by \n\nan abrupt lithologic change, which is interpreted as the expression of the prominent sea level fall that \n\ncharacterized the end of Danian across the whole basin (Bernaola et al., 2009). \n\nBernaola et al. (2009) subdivided the Aitzgorri and Itzurn formations \n\ninto a series of informal members. The Aitzgorri Fm is largely pink-\n\nreddish in color and was subdivided in two members: (1) a \u201ccrowded\u201d \n\nmember which is 7 m thick and consists of amalgamated limestones \n\nor limestones with very thin interbedded marls and, (2) a \u201cstratified\u201d \n\nmember which is 9 m thick and overlies the \u201ccrowded\u201d member. This \n\nmember takes its name from the well-developed bedding and obvious \n\ncontrast between limestones and intervening marlstones. The Itzurun \n\nFm shows higher vertical variations in both the relative proportions of \n\nhemipelagic sediments and the amount of turbidite intercalations. In \n\ncontrast to the Aitzgorri Fm, dark to light grey colors dominate the \n\nItzurun Fm. However, the base of the formation is defined by a 5.5 m \n\nthick interval of marls and marlstones of a characteristic red color \n\n(Bernaola et al., 2009). \n\nTwo set of samples from Zumaia were collected by Dr. Eric Font and \n\nDr. Thierry Adatte in 2015. A total of 113 samples (labelled Z) were \n\ncollected from 5.5 m above to 5 m below the KPg boundary with a \n\nsample spacing of 5-10 cm (Figure 2.1 C; Figure 2.3). A second set of \n\n454 rock fragments (labelled ZU) was collected from 3 m above to \n\n2.42 m below the KPg boundary, based on sample spacing of 1-3 cm, \n\nfor high resolution magnetic property analysis.  \n\nBiostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic constrains shown in Figure \n\n2.3 are from Dinar\u00e8s-Turrel et al. (2003) and Font et al. (2018).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Log of the sampled section showing the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and bio, magneto and lithostratigraphic \n\ninformation. The location of the samples is also shown. (Modified from Font et al., 2018). \n\n \n\n2.2 The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum at Dababiya (Egypt) \n\nThe Dababiya section is located at the eastern side of the upper Nile Valley, near Dababiya village, 35 \n\nkm southeast of Luxor City (25\u00ba30\u2019 N, 32\u00ba31\u2019 E), Egypt (Figure 2.4).  \n\nThe Paleocene-Eocene transition in the southern margin of the Tethys in Egypt includes the outer-shelf \n\ndeposits of northeast Egypt and Sinai. In the eastern desert the monocline of the Upper Cretaceous to \n\nUpper Eocene resulted in uplift and exposure of the outer shelf to marginal marine strata across the \n\ndesert in northeastern Egypt where they are exposed in mesas and ridges (Khozyem et al., 2015). The \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nDababiya section is one of these exposures. It is a composite section consisting of four partial, \n\nstratigraphically overlapping sections namely DBA, DBE, DBH and DBD (Berggren &amp; Ouda, 2003) \n\n(Figure 2.5B). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Location map of Dababiya section. \n\nThe area corresponds to an old and abandoned quarry of limestones, shales and marls, which provides \n\na remarkable three-dimensional view in some outcrops (Figure 2.5). Limestones were quarried in \n\nPharaonic times and used in the construction of the temples of Luxor and Karnak. Shales and marls were \n\nextensively excavated, probably for bricks (Despuis et al., 2003) until the beginning of the XXI century. \n\nIn addition to the clear-cut exposure, the Dababiya section also provides a detailed record of lithologic, \n\nmineralogic, biotic and geochemical events that were associated with the PETM. Therefore, the \n\nInternational Comission of Stratigraphy (ICS) designated, in 2003, the Dababiya outcrop (section DBH) \n\nas the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Paleocene-Eocene boundary.  \n\nFour main lithostratigraphic Formations are exposed in Dababiya\u2019s area range: Dakhla, Tarawan, Esna \n\nand Thebes, from older to younger, respectively (Figure 2.5). \n\nThe Dakhla Formation in Dababiya area is limited to a few meters (~7m) in thickness (Berggren &amp; \n\nOuda, 2003) and is composed of a dark-grayish to grayish green shale, with 60 to 80% of carbonate \n\ncontent (Despuis et al., 2003). Sometimes, it is reddish and ferruginated, with thin veinlets of anhydrite. \n\nThe base of the section is covered by rock debris and wind-blown sands (Berggren &amp; Ouda, 2003). \n\nThe Tarawan Formation is composed of a snow-white to grayish white, indurated chalk that grades \n\nupward into yellowish marly limestones. It contains, locally, thin brownish chert bands, which do not \n\nexceed 3 cm in thickness and are usually dissected by a network of calcite veinlets (Berggren &amp; Ouda, \n\n2003). The total thickness of this Formation at Dababiya is 21.5 m and, except in the upper part, where \n\nstratification is absent. The carbonate content is high (~85% average) in the lower part of the Tarawan \n\nlimestone. Approximately, halfway through the section there is only 60-70% of carbonate content and \n\nthen, it decreases drastically, thereby marking the transition to the Esna Formation (Despuis et al., 2003).  \n\nThe Esna Formation is ~130 m thick at Dababiya (Despuis et al., 2003). It consists of a grayish and \n\ngreenish gray laminated shale and brown marls. The lowermost part of the section encloses a thin band \n\n(~2 m thick) of laminated, partly coprolite-rich, phosphatic shale grading upward into calcareous shales \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nand marls. This interval overlies a thin dark gray clayey horizon (~0,75 m thick) and underlies a highly \n\nfossiliferous detrital limestone of calcarenitic nature (1 m thick) (Berggren &amp; Ouda, 2003). \n\nDespuis et al. (2003) divided the Esna Formation into three main units based on carbonate content: Esna-\n\n1, Esna-2 and Esna-3. Only Esna-1 and Esna-2 are exposed in GSSP outcrop. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 A) Oblique east-facing view of the outcrops in the Dababiya Quarry as seen from the hill immediately to the north \n\nof the village of Dababiya. B) Sketch outlining the exposures of the main lithostratigraphic units: Dakhla Shales, Tarawan \n\nChalk, Esna Shale and Thebes Limestone and the four partial sections DBA, DBD, DBE and DBH (P/E GSSP) are shown \n\n(modified from Aubry et al., 2007). \n\nThe lower Unit Esna-1 is ~7 m thick and it is composed of gray shales containing variable amounts of \n\ncarbonate. It extends from the base of the Esna Shale up to the contact with the dark clay (Berggren &amp; \n\nOuda, 2003) that defines the limit between units Esna-1 and Esna-2 and also the P/E boundary, which \n\nwas defined based on the following criteria (Saleh, H., 2013): (1) the negative organic carbon isotope \n\nexcursion (CIE), (2) the extinction of deep water benthic foraminifera (Stensioina beccariiformis), (3) \n\nthe transient occurrence of planktonic foraminifera (Acarinina Africana, A. sibaiyaensis, Morozovella \n\nallisonensis) during the ? ?13  excursion, (4) the transient occurrence of the Rhomboaster spp. \u2013 \n\nDiscoaster araneus nannofossils assemblage and (5)  an acme of the dinoflagellate Apectodiniu.    \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nThe middle unit, Esna-2, is ~70 m thick. The first 5 m of Esna-2 are composed of a singular succession \n\nof five lithologies designated by Despuis et al. (2003) as The Dababiya Quarry Beds. The remaining 65 \n\nm of Esna-2 are essentially clayey, rather dark in color, without prominent bedding and with carbonate \n\ncontent that never exceeds 50%. Despuis et al. (2003) described the Dababiya Quarry Beds cropping \n\nout in DBH section: \n\n- Bed 1 is 0.63 m thick and it is composed of dark laminated non-calcareous clay with a few phosphatic \n\ncoprolites (0.5 cm diameter) at the base.  There is a substantial increase (from 7% to 11-14%) in \n\nquartz at the base of Dababiya Quarry Beds. The quartz content progressively increases upwards in \n\nBed 1 to 32% at the top. \n\n \n\n- Bed 2 is 0.50 m thick and is a phosphatic (~14% apatite) brown shale with numerous phosphatic \n\ncoprolites with 0.5 cm diameter. It is characterized by an increase in carbonate content (up to 30%) \n\ncoupled with a decrease in quartz content to about 18%. \n\n \n\n- Bed 3 is 0.84 m thick and corresponds to a cream-colored, laminated phosphatic shale with sparse \n\nphosphatic coprolites (0.5 cm diameter) and numerous lens-like and pale phosphate inclusions (1 cm \n\ndiameter). The apatite content in this bed varies between 12% at the base and 8% near the top. \n\nCoprolites are essentially absent in this unit, which means that the high apatite content cannot be \n\nexplained by the coprolite accumulation so, another phosphorus bearer should be presented. The \n\ncarbonate content decreases upward in the bed from 18% to 12%. The base of the bed is locally \n\nmarked by concretions of iron oxides, anhydrite and jarosite, interpreted as weathering products of \n\npyrite nodules. \n\n \n\n- Bed 4 is 0.71 m thick and it is composed of grey shale with an increasing carbonate content (from \n\n40% to 50%) and decreasing contents of quartz (from 12% to 6%) and apatite (from ~6% to 3%). \n\n \n\n- Bed 5 is 1 m thick and corresponds to a marly calcarenitic limestone. The highest carbonate content \n\n(67%) of the Dababiya Quarry Beds is recorded at the base of this bed, whose contact with Bed 4 is \n\nunbioturbated. The high carbonate contents coincide with low apatite and quartz contents, ~1% and \n\n5%, respectively.  \n\nThe upper unit of Esna Formation, Esna-3, which is not exposed in GSSP outcrop, is ~ 45 m thick \n\nconsisting of an alternation of marls, marly limestones and limestones with very thin shale intercalations. \n\nCompared to Esna-2, this interval has a lighter color and a higher carbonate content (Despuis et. al., \n\n2003). Berggren &amp; Ouda (2003) describe this unit as being characterized by limestone stringers that \n\nbecome increasingly common, thicker and more indurated upwards. Iron and phosphatic rods and \n\nincrustations are commonly scattered throughout the unit. The foraminiferal content and preservation \n\nvary widely from common to barren and from fair to very good, respectively.  \n\nThe boundary between Esna-3 and Thebes Formation is marked by a prominent 1 m thick limestone bed \n\ncontaining 90% of carbonate. There has been some controversy over the placement of this boundary. \n\nAccording to Berggren &amp; Ouda (2003), Unit Esna 3 has been attributed to the Thebes Formation by \n\nsome researchers. However, the lithology, faunal content and depositional environment of this unit \n\nsupport strongly its inclusion in the Esna Formation. The most acceptable placement of the boundary is \n\nthe one proposed by Said (1960), who placed it at the base of the massive limestone bed.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\nThe Thebes Formation is ~290 m thick and consists of massive and partly chalky limestones, \n\noccasionally thin-bedded, containing bands and nodules of chert at the base and Nummulites and \n\nOperculina banks at the top. This Formation has been divided into three members: (1) a lower Hamidat \n\nMember, 55 m thick, that consist of thinly bedded limestone containing chert bands and nodules, (2) a \n\nmiddle Dababiya Member of massive snow-white chalky limestone rich in Nummulites, Operculina and \n\nAssilina, 95 m thick, and (3) an upper El Shaghab Member, 60 m thick, composed of massive oyster \n\nlimestone with echinoids and alveolinids (Berggren &amp; Ouda, 2003). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Field photograph of the sampled section showing the PE boundary and beds of Esna-2 Unit. (Photo provided by \n\nDr. Thierry Adatte).  \n\nSamples from Dababiya were supplied by Dr. Thierry Adatte who collected them in the context of the \n\ndoctoral thesis of Hassan Saleh (Saleh, H., 2013). 54 samples (labelled Db) were provided, which were \n\ncollected at 2 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm sample spacings spanning the Upper Paleocene to Lower Eocene \n\ninterval.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 Diagram illustrating the lateral disappearance of basal beds on either side of the main GSSP outcrop due to \n\ndeposition in an asymmetric channel. (Modified from Saleh, 2013).  \n\nThe Dababiya GSSP outcrop is not available for sampling because of its limited lateral exposure \n\naccessibility (just few tens of meters), the likely annihilation of the rock exposure due the oversampling \n\nand other political complications (Saleh, H., 2013). Therefore, the samples were collected on an identical \n\nsequence (Figure 2.6), 50 m to the left (NW) of the main GSSP outcrop. The basal beds of the GSSP \n\noutcrop were deposited in a submarine channel. Thus, because of the channel morphology, Esna-2 units \n\nin the sampled section are less thick than Esna-2 units in the GSSP outcrop (Figure 2.7) (Saleh, 2013).  \n\nSince no field work was carried out in this project, the lithological descriptions and the log (Figure 2.8) \n\npresented by Saleh (2013) were adopted. The sampled section consists of the late Paleocene marl to \n\nmarly shale of Esna-1, a well-defined sequence boundary and the overlying early Eocene Esna-2 unit. \n\nSaleh (2013) divided Esna-2 into five beds with the following thickness and lithological characteristics: \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n- Bed 1: silty claystone with anhydrite layers; 0.32 m thickness. \n\n- Bed 2: silty claystone with anhydrite layers; 0.48 m thickness. \n\n- Bed 3: silty marl with phosphatic nodules and anhydrite; 0.24 m thickness. \n\n- Bed 4: marl to marly limestone; 1.0 m thickness. \n\n- Bed 5: only the basal 0.05 m were recovered and therefore it was difficult to describe lithology.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 Log of the sampled section showing the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and location of the samples (Modified from \n\nSaleh, 2013). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n3. Methods \n\nBefore the application of magnetic methods, mass was measured for each sample with a precision of \n\n10?3 g. Both sets of samples, Z and Db, were previously crushed by using an agate mortar at the \n\nUniversity of Lausanne.   \n\n3.1 Magnetic Susceptibility \n\nAll materials tend to be magnetized when a magnetic field is applied. The magnetization acquired for \n\neach material (Induced Magnetization, J) is proportional to the magnetic field (H), as shown in equation \n\n3.1. However, different materials will acquire different values of J for the same H. This is due to the fact \n\nthat some minerals have greater capacity than others to acquire magnetization. This ability is called \n\nMagnetic Susceptibility (k) and it is a physical property inherent to each mineral. Therefore, k is a \n\nconstant of proportionality between J and H and it can be defined as a measure of the ease with which a \n\nmaterial can be magnetized (Thompson &amp; Oldfield, 1986) when a magnetic field is applied.  \n\n                                                                 ? = ??                                                         (3.1) \n\nMagnetic susceptibility can be expressed as a function of the volume being, in that case, a dimensionless \n\nproperty, or as a function of the mass, which the units are m3/kg.  \n\nk values of the samples (Z and Db) were measured at the Institute Dom Lu\u00eds Laboratory with an MFK1 \n\nKappa Bridge susceptometer, manufactured by AGICO, at the frequency F1 (976 Hz) and reported \n\nrelative to mass.  \n\nMagnetic susceptibility depends on the concentration of the magnetizable material in a sample and on \n\nthe composition of that material namely mineralogy, grain size and shape. Magnetizable materials in \n\nsediments are comprised of not only ferrimagnetic minerals such as the iron oxide minerals magnetite \n\nand maghemite, and iron sulfide and sulfate minerals, like pyrrhotite and greigite, but also other less \n\nmagnetic compounds, including paramagnetic ones. The important paramagnetic minerals in sediments \n\nare the clays (predominantly chlorite, smectite and illite), ferromagnesian silicates (such as biotite, \n\npyroxene and amphiboles), iron sulfides (such as pyrite and marcasite), iron carbonates (including \n\nsiderite and ankerite) and other iron and magnesium bearing minerals. In addition to ferrimagnetic and \n\nparamagnetic, there may be an abundance of diamagnetic compounds such as calcite, quartz and organic \n\nmatter. Diamagnetic materials typically acquire a very weak negative k when a magnetic field is applied, \n\ni.e., their acquired k is opposed to the magnetic field applied. Consequently, the presence of diamagnetic \n\nminerals reduces the k in a sample. However, since the k magnitude in diamagnetic minerals is so weak \n\ncompared to paramagnetic and ferromagnetic minerals, the diamagnetic contribution is generally \n\nnegligible (Ellwood et al., 2003, 2008). \n\nMagnetic susceptibility profiles are typically the combination of two signals: a high-frequency, low-\n\namplitude cyclic signal and an irregular low-frequency, high-amplitude signal. The first one may be due \n\nto weathering, secondary alteration and metamorphism in sedimentary sequences (Ellwood, 2008). The \n\nsecond one is dominated by eustasy and climate variations (Milankovitch cycles), where high-\n\namplitude, low frequency k variations result from transgressive and regressive sea-level fluctuations. \n\nWhen the sea-level drops, the base level falls and erosion increases, thus more detrital grains are sent to \n\nthe marine environment producing high k values (Crick et al., 2001; Ellwood et al., 2003; Correia, J., \n\n2010). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n3.2 Frequency Dependent Susceptibility \n\nThe frequency dependent susceptibility (Kfd) method is used to evaluate the presence of ultrafine (<0.03 \n\n?m) superparamagnetic (SP) particles in a sample. Superparamagnetic particles are ferrimagnetic \n\nminerals produced largely by biochemical processes in soils (Dearing, J. A., 1994) or by chemical \n\nalteration. For exemple, chemical remagnetization in carbonates generally result in significant SP \n\ncontent (Jackson, 1990; Jackson et al., 1992, 1993; Channell and McCabe, 1994; Font et al., 2006). \n\nTherefore, Kfd is an indicator of chemical alteration of carbonates in the case of the Zumaia and Dababiya \n\nsections studied here. Measurements of Kfd involve making two k readings in magnetic fields created at \n\ntwo different frequencies: Low (Lf) and High (Hf) frequencies.  \n\n \n\nA low frequency measurement allows the SP crystals to behave as ferromagnetic minerals fully \n\ncontributing to the MS signal. At high frequency, the SP crystals acquire a paramagnetic behavior. Since \n\nSP crystals lose their magnetization in a very short period of time (about 1/10000th of a second) when \n\nthe induced magnetic field is removed, a sample without SP crystals would show the same k in the two \n\nfrequencies. On the other hand, samples with SP crystals would show slightly lower values at high \n\nfrequency than at low frequency (Dearing, J. A., 1994). \n\n \n\nThe Kfd index formula (equation 3.2) expressed as a percentage of the original Lf reading and the \n\ninterpretations of Kfd values (Table 3.1) were proposed by Dearing (1994):   \n\n \n\n??? (%) =\n?????\n\n??\n\u00d7  100                                               (3.2) \n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Interpretation of frequency dependent susceptibility values. \n\nKfd (%) Interpretation \n\nLow &lt;2.0 Virtually no SP grains (<10%) \n\nMedium 2.0 \u2013 10.0 Admixture of SP and coarser non-SP grains, or SP grains&lt;0.005 ?m \n\nHigh 10.0 \u2013 14.0 Virtually all (>75%) SP grains \n\nVery High > 14.0 Rare values, erroneous measurement, weak sample or contamination \n\nThe k values of the samples (Z and Db) were measured at the Institute Dom Lu\u00eds Laboratory with a \n\nMFK1 Kappa Bridge susceptometer at the frequencies F1 (976 Hz) and F3 (15616 Hz) corresponding \n\nto the low and high frequencies, respectively. Negative and very high values (>14%) of Kfd were \n\nconsidered to be erroneous. Therefore, they were eliminated and are not presented in the results. \n\n3.3 Isothermal Remanent Magnetization curves \n\nIn contrary to magnetic susceptibility, which includes the relative contribution of para-, dia- and \n\nferromagnetic particles, Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) only reflect the contribution of \n\nferromagnetic particles. IRM is the magnetization acquired by a sample when submitted to an induced \n\nmagnetic field, at constant temperature. In this method, a known volume sample is subjected to a \n\nprogressively increasing unidirectional magnetic field (in mT). After each increase in the applied field, \n\nthe sample is removed, and its magnetization (in A/m) is measured (Robertson &amp; France, 1994).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nSeveral iron oxides may be simultaneously present in a natural sample. For example, hematite, goethite \n\nand magnetite are very common in sedimentary rocks. Different minerals show different coercivity \n\nvalues so, only the ferromagnetic minerals with lower coercivity than the applied field will be \n\nmagnetized in each step. Consequently, only high field values will be able to magnetize very coercive \n\nparticles, such as goethite. An example of an IRM curve is shown in Figure 3.1. The IRM curve provides \n\ntwo crucial informations: the values of the magnetization at saturation (SIRM), which is proportional to \n\nthe concentration of ferromagnetic particles, and the coercivity (B1/2), which is characteristic of the \n\nnature of the ferromagnetic particles (ex. Magnetite, hematite, goethite).    \n\nIn cases of mixed magnetic mineralogy, Robertson &amp; France (1994) observed experimentally that the \n\nIRM acquisition curves of individual minerals follow a cumulative log-Gaussian (CLG) function. An \n\nIRM curve can therefore be decomposed into several CLG curves, which can be individually \n\ncharacterized by three important parameters: magnetization of saturation (SIRM), mean coercivity force \n\n(B1/2), that is the field needed to induce half of the saturation, and the dispersion parameter (DP), given \n\nby one standard deviation of the logarithmic distribution (Kruiver et al., 2001). The DP is generally \n\nrelated to the distribution of grain sizes. \n\nIRM is very sensitive to ferro/ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic particles, even in very low amounts \n\n(Font et al., 2014), which allows the identification of the types of iron oxide minerals present in a sample. \n\nEgli (2003, 2004) identified a series of common magnetic components, presented in table 3.2. \n\nTable 3.2 \u2013 Common magnetic components and its typical IRM parameter values (Egli, 2003, 2004). \n\nComponents Log B1/2 DP \n\nPedogenic and extracellular magnetite 1.34 0.34 \n\nDetrital Magnetite 1.46 0.36 \n\nLow-coercivity magnetofossils 1.64 0.19 \n\nHigh-coercivity magnetofossils 1.85 0.15 \n\nHematite 2.30 0.27 \n\nGoethite 3.30 0.25 \n\nThe types of iron oxide minerals present in natural materials may be used to correlate sedimentary \n\nhorizons with other horizons or sources, to evaluate on the nature of chemical processes accompanying \n\nsedimentation in certain environments and to detect changes in sedimentary environment often related \n\nto climate changes (Robertson &amp; France, 1994; Kruiver et al., 2001). \n\nBefore IRM acquisition procedures, Db sprayed samples and ZU rock fragments, were put into cubic \n\nplastic boxes of 8 cm3 with special care to ensure there were no contaminations. All analyzed samples \n\nwere demagnetized with a LDA-3A AF demagnetizer (AGICO) to avoid any initial remanent \n\nmagnetization. IRM curves were posteriorly acquired by the application of a magnetic field that was \n\ngradually increased up to a maximum peak of 1.2 T using an IM-10-30 impulse magnetizer. The \n\nacquired magnetization at each step was measured with a JR6 spinner magnetometer. All the procedures \n\nwere carried out at the Institute Dom Lu\u00eds Laboratory.  \n\nFinally, IRM curves were analyzed using a cumulative Log-Gaussian function, with the software \n\ndeveloped by Kruiver et al. (2001) and the Max UnMix program developed by Maxbauer et al. (2016). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nThe Kruiver et al. (2001) method is based on the assumption that an IRM acquisition curve follows a \n\nCLG function and it is accessible for readers to use through download of an excel workbook. The \n\nanalysis of the IRM acquisition curves is done by converting the field values in their logarithmic values \n\nand plotting them versus: (i) the acquisition curve on a linear scale, (ii) the acquisition curve expressed \n\nas a gradient and (iii) the acquisition curve on a probability scale (Figure 3.1). The analysis of IRM \n\nacquisition curves on a linear ordinate scale is referred to as LAP (Linear Acquisition Plot), as a gradient \n\nas GAP (Gradient Acquisition Plot) and, on a probability scale as SAP (Standardized Acquisition Plot). \n\nThe combined analysis of LAP, GAP and SAP is referred to as CLG analysis (Kruiver et al., 2001). \n\nPlotting an IRM acquisition curve in this way is visually appealing because a unimodal distribution will \n\nbe representing by a straight line (Figure 3.1). When the data points do not plot on a linear path it means \n\nthat the acquisition curve needs to be fitted with more than one component.  \n\nWith the combination of the three plots, it is possible to obtain a robust determination of the magnetic \n\ncomponents. Initial SIRM values can be easily estimated from the LAP and, the GAP provides initial \n\nvalues for log(?1/2) and DP. The modelled LAP, GAP and SAP are compared and fitted to the data. \n\nThe adequateness of the fit is expressed by the sum of the squared differences between the data and the \n\nmodel (squared residuals) for each plot. The values for SIRM, log(?1/2) and DP are optimized \n\ninteractively by minimizing these squared residuals. This method discriminates on the basis of different \n\nmineral coercivity. Therefore, additional rock-magnetic tests are still required to separate minerals with \n\nsimilar coercivities (Kruiver et al., 2001).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Representation of a) LAP, b) GAP and c) SAP. The squares are an example of a natural sample of a single \n\nmagnetic mineral (titanomagnetite) and as such the data plot is a straight line (Kruiver et al., 2001). \n\nThe Kruiver et al. (2001) software also calculates, from de IRM acquisition curve, the expected S-ratio \n\nfor the modelled components. Two S-ratio definitions are given as output: \n\n(1) The classical definition: ?????0.3? /???1? \n\n(2) The Bloemendal et al. (1992) definition: (1 ?\n????0.3?\n\n???1?\n)/2 \n\nIn this project it will be used the normalized definition of Bloemendal et al. (1992). The interpretation \n\nof S-ratio, which can vary from 0 to 1, is based on the tendency of the coercivity to vary significantly \n\nwith magnetic mineralogy. Ferrimagnetic minerals such as magnetite have considerably lower \n\ncoercivities than the antiferromagnetic minerals goethite and hematite. Consequently, higher (lower) S-\n\nratio values reflect higher (lower) proportions of magnetite to the high coercivity minerals hematite \n\nand/or goethite (Bloemendal et al., 1992). \n\nThe Max UnMix program is a web application built using the shiny package for R studio. As the Kruiver \n\net al. (2001) method, it is used for un-mix coercivity distributions derived from magnetization curves. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nHowever, Max UnMix is designed to be user friendly, it runs as an independent website, and it is \n\nplatform independent (Maxbauer et al., 2016).  \n\nThe Kruiver et al. (2001) method assumes that an IRM acquisition curve follows a CLG function. \n\nHowever, it is known that many natural samples contain magnetic mineral components whose \n\ncoercivities are not log-normal (Maxbauer et al., 2016). Instead of CLG function, the Max UnMix \n\nprogram uses a skew generalized Gaussian (SGG) function, introduced by Egli (2003). The SGG \n\nfunction has major advantages over simple Gaussian distributions because it can better account for non-\n\nnormal behavior that is common in natural samples. Deviations from normality can dictate the need for \n\nadditional normal or log-normal components within a model to achieve a satisfactory fit, whereas a \n\nsingle skew component may prove sufficient (Maxbauer et al., 2016). \n\nThe analysis with the Max UnMix program is done in three simple steps: fitting, optimization and error \n\nanalysis. The fitting is a subjective process achieved through an interactive interface where the user \n\nselects the initial model parameters (mean coercivity, dispersion, relative proportion and skewness) with \n\nslider bar inputs. This should be done with caution and consideration for known parameters values of \n\nmagnetic minerals compounds. The optimization of the initial parameters is achieved using the optim() \n\nfunction, which iteratively determines the ideal values of initial parameters to minimize the residual sum \n\nsquared (RSS) between the observed and the modeled coercivity distribution (see, Maxbauer et al., 2016, \n\nfor details). In order to determine the number of magnetic minerals components the Max UnMix \n\napplication allows F-tests to be performed on models with a variable number of components. It is also \n\npossible to calculate the relative contribution of each component. In the error analysis, a resampling \n\nroutine is used to assign uncertainties to the optimized model parameters and resultant modeled \n\ncoercivity. For a user-defined number of resampling events, the model calculates newly optimized \n\nvalues based on a Monte-Carlo method. The final set of results provides users with a robust sense of \n\nuncertainty and model quality. \n\n3.4 Forc diagrams \n\nFirst-order reversal curve (FORC) diagrams are used to understand magnetization processes in fine \n\nmagnetic particle systems (Roberts et al., 2014). This technique was introduced in rock magnetism by \n\nPike et al., (1999) and Roberts et al. (2000) and it provides a way to identify magnetic minerals and \n\ncharacterize their domain structures and interactions by measuring partial hysteresis curves.  \n\nThe composition and grain-size distribution of magnetic minerals determine the overall magnetic \n\nproperties of a rock or sediment and the stability of its natural remanent magnetization (NRM) through \n\ngeological time. The smallest magnetic grains, containing only a single-domain (SD) and the SP \n\nparticles, have the strongest and most stable remanence, producing the most reliable results in \n\npaleointensity studies. On the other hand, larger magnetic grains, multi-domain (MD), produce the least \n\nmeaningful results. Pseudo-single-domain (PSD) grains are usually volumetrically dominant in a typical \n\nrock or sediment and they have a relatively strong and stable remanence. Comparing to SD and MD, \n\nPSD grains produce intermediate reliable results (Muxworthy &amp; Dunlop, 2002).  \n\nA FORC is measured by progressively saturating a sample in a field ????, decreasing the field to a \n\nvalue ??, reversing and sweeping it back to ????   in a series of a regular field steps, ?? (Figure  3.2 (a)) \n\n(Gubbins &amp; Herrero-Bervera, 2007). This process is repeated for about 100 different values of ??, \n\nproducing a series of FORCs (Figure 3.2 (b)). Hysteresis data represent the composite magnetic response \n\nof all particles within a sample, therefore providing a measure of the bulk magnetic properties of the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nsample (Roberts et al., 2000). The measured magnetization at each step as a function of ?? and ?? gives \n\nan ?(??, ?? ) that can be plotted as a function of ?? and ?? in the field space (Figure 3.2 (c)). The field \n\nsteps are chosen in such a way that ?? and ??  are regularly spaced, which means that ?(??, ?? ) can \n\nbe plotted on a regular grid (Gubbins &amp; Herrero-Bervera, 2007). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Illustration of the construction of a FORC diagram. (Gubbins &amp; Herrero-Bervera, 2007). \n\nThe FORC distribution ?(??, ?? ) is defined as the mixed second derivative of the surface shown in \n\nFigure 3.2 (c): \n\n?(??, ?? ) =\n?2?(??, ?? )\n\n??????\n                                                                    (3.3) \n\nThe FORC distribution ?(??, ?? ) at a point P is calculated by fitting a polynomial surface on the square \n\ngrid with P at the center. In order to reduce the effect of measurement noise, which is magnified by the \n\nsecond derivative, smoothing is required. The smoothing factor (SF) sets the size of the local square \n\ngrid on which the polynomial fit of the magnetization is performed. The number of the points of the grid \n\nis (2SF+1)2 (Carvallo et al., 2003).  \n\nThe final FORC diagram is given by the contour plot of ?(??, ?? ) (Figure 3.2 (d)). In this case, it is \n\nconvenient to rotate the axes by changing coordinates from (??,??) ?? (?? , ?? ), where ??  is the \n\ncoercivity ?? = (?? ? ??) 2?   and  ?? is the magnetic interaction field distribution ?? =\n\n(?? + ??) 2?  (Roberts et al., 2014). \n\nDistinct domain structures and interactions of the particles result in different patterns of the final FORC \n\ndiagram.  An ideal noninteracting SD particle will have a FORC distribution that lies at ?? =  ????  and \n\n?? = 0 (Figure 3.3 (a)). For assemblages of randomly orientated noninteracting SD grains, FORC \n\ndiagrams will show a central peak due to the switching of the magnetization at ???? . This peak will \n\nshow an asymmetric \u201cboomerang\u201d shape and there will be a negative region near the bottom left-hand \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\ncorner of the diagram (Figure 3.3 (b)). For interacting SD grains, ??  corresponds to the coercive force \n\nof each SD loop in the absence of interactions and ?? is the local interaction field ?? . When the ideal \n\nSD grain is affected by magnetic interactions,  ?? will shift the switching field, resulting in a spreading \n\nin the ?? direction on a FORC diagram (Figure 3.3 (c)).  \n\nFORC diagrams for MD grains display a series of contours nearly parallel to the ?? axis (Figure 3.3 \n\n(d)). This pattern is similar to the one for interacting SD grains. However, instead of being due to inter-\n\ngrain magnetostatic interaction fields, the spreading is caused by internal demagnetization fields \n\n(Gubbins &amp; Herrero-Bervera, 2007). As PSD grains have an intermediate behavior, they display the \n\nclosed peak structure typical of SD grains and the contours parallel to the ?? axis typical of MD grains \n\n(Figure 3.3 (e)). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Interpretation of the different patterns of FORC diagrams. (Modified from Gubbins &amp; Herrero-Bervera, 2007). \n\nSP grains will only manifest themselves on the FORC diagram if their relaxation time is of the same \n\norder as the averaging time. If the grains have shorter relaxation times (???? ? 0),  ?(??, ?? ) = 0 at \n\nall values (Roberts, 2000). FORC diagrams for the manifesting SP particles show a series of contours \n\nrunning parallel to the ?? axis and a pronounced peak along ?? = 0 (Figure 3.3 (f)) that can be similar \n\nto the one for noninteracting SD particles. However, the distinction can be easily made through the \n\nidentification of thermal relaxation time by cooling a sample (Gubbins &amp; Herrero-Bervera, 2007).    \n\nUltrafine magnetic particles (SP and SD) can be used as paleoenvironmental tracers because they have \n\nan authigenic origin and they can also be an important source of a stable NRM. Magnetostatic bacteria \n\nsynthetize chains of SD particles (magnetossomes) with extremely controlled sizes and shapes. \n\nMagnetossomes can be preserved over geological times as fossils. Magnetofossils have been found in a \n\nvariety of marine and freshwater sediments and sedimentary rocks, where they can contribute with more \n\nthan 60% to the saturation remanent magnetization. Magnetofossils are extremely useful in \n\npaleoenvironmental studies because they provide information about past geochemical conditions that \n\nfavored growth of magnetotactic bacteria and/or that controlled the preservation or dissolution of \n\nmagnetossomes (Egli et al., 2010). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\nFORC analysis were implement only for a few samples of Dababiya. The procedures were carried out \n\nby Alexandra Abrajevitch from the Department of Earth Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, Ehime \n\nUniversity, Matsuyama City, Japan. Because of time constrains, low resolution FORCs were measured, \n\nwith a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). A saturating field of 1T, an averaging time of 100 ms \n\nand a wait time of 1s between successive measurements were used. Each measurement run included 100 \n\nFORCs, measured with a field increment of 2.3 mT and were processed with an SF of 5. FORC \n\nmeasurement time for one sample was approximately 58 minutes. The results were processed using the \n\nalgorithm of Zhao et al. (2015).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n4. Results \n\n4.1 The KPg transition at Zumaia \n\nMass specific magnetic susceptibility of the Z and ZU collections is illustrated in Figure 4.1 and 4.3, \n\nrespectively. In both set of samples, the MS shows the same trend, conforting a reliable repeatability of \n\nthe measurement. Mass specific magnetic susceptibility (m3/kg) of the Zumaia section is strongly facies-\n\ndependent, as the magnetic signal is well correlated with the mineralogy (Font et al., 2018). In the case \n\nof the Z collection, MS varies from higher values (5.9 ? 12.9 \u00d7 10?8 ?3/??) in Maastrichtian marls \n\nto lower values (1.0 ? 8.6 \u00d7 10?8 ?3/??) in the Danian limestones. A slight but significant gradual \n\ndecrease in MS values can be observed 2 m below the K-Pg boundary (Figure 4.1). Negative shifts of \n\nMS data observed in the Maastrichtian correspond to turbidite layers (Figure 4.3). Because iron oxide \n\ncontent and grain size have no environmental significance in turbidites, these samples were further \n\nexcluded from IRM analysis. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Magnetic data (MS and Kfd) of Zumaia (collection Z).

Absolute values are reported in table 8.1. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 a) Linear Acquisition plot of Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) curves of 6 representative samples of \n\nthe Zumaia section (ZU collection), unmixed by using the Kruiver et al. (2001) software. b) Coercivity distribution (Gradient \n\nacquisition plot) derived from IRM curves obtained by using the MAX UnMix software (Maxbauer et al., 2016). The shaded \n\narea represents error envelopes of 95% confidence intervals. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nFrequency-dependent susceptibility (Kfd) results of the Zumaia section (Z collection) are indicative of a \n\nvery low SP particle contribution. Kfd values vary essentially between 2-10% (Figure 4.1), which is \n\nindicative of admixture of SP and coarser non-SP grains, or SP grains &lt;0.005 \u00b5m (Dearing, 1994). \n\nHowever, a significant number of samples range Kfd values between 0-2% revealing the absence of SP \n\ngrains (Dearing, 1994). Such values indicate that there were no significant biochemical processes \n\nleading to rock alteration. Negative and very high values (>14%) of Kfd are generally considered to be \n\nerroneous (Dearing, 1994) and therefore were not considered in Figure 4.1. Moreover, values above \n\nsample Z-91 might not be significant, due to the very low susceptibility, which induces higher \n\nmeasurement errors.  \n\nIRM measurements were carried out for the high resolution ZU sample collection. The linear and \n\ngradient acquisition plots (LAP and GAP, respectively) of 6 samples, representative of the section, are \n\npresented in Figure 4.2. After unmixing IRM curves, four components were identified along the Zumaia \n\nsection (Figures 4.2 and 4.3): detrital magnetite, soft biomagnetite, hard biomagnetite and hematite. \n\nThe LAP\u2019s of IRM curves (Figure 4.2 a) show that between samples ZU8.7.1 (+101 cm) and ZU6.2.4 \n\n(-15 cm) the contribution of hematite is considerably lower compared to the other components. \n\nHowever, below sample ZU6.23 (-76.8 cm) the contribution of hematite becomes higher and the total \n\nSIRM does not reach saturation. This is because hematite is a more coercive mineral than magnetite \n\n(Figure 4.2 b), which implies a higher applied magnetic field to reach saturation. The hematite is \n\ninterpreted as a post-depositional component, probably responsible for the reddish color of the altered \n\nrocks and therefore, may not have an environmental significance. \n\nComponent 1 has logarithmic values of mean coercivity (Log B1/2) ranging 1.2 \u2013 1.47 mT and dispersion \n\nparameter (DP) values ranging from 0.28 to 0.35 mT, wich are typical of detrital magnetite (Figure 4.3) \n\n(Egli, 2004). Component 2 and Component 3 are both characterized by very small values of DP, \n\nessentially between 0.1 and 0.2 mT,  wich is typical of biogenic magnetite. Component 2 shows typical \n\nvalues of soft biomagnetite and component 3 of hard biomagnetite. Finally, Component 4 has a Log B1/2  \n\nvalues between 2.15 \u2013  2.67 mT and DP values from 0.2 to 0.45 mT, typical of hematite. \n\nThe concentrations of detrital magnetite, biomagnetite (hard and soft) and hematite are proportional to \n\ntheir saturation remanent values (SIRM). SIRM values of each component are represented in Figures \n\n4.2 and 4.3. The concentration of each component is dependent of the lithology. Danian carbonates have \n\na lower abundance of magnetite and hematite than the Maastrichtian marls, because marls have a much \n\nmore detrital affinity than carbonates. Components 1, 2 and 3 experience a gradual decrease in the upper \n\nMaastrichtian up to the K-Pg boundary. However, the abundance of hard biomagnetite decreases more \n\nabruptly in the last 50 cm below the K-Pg boundary, and reach values as low as those observed in the \n\nbasal Danian sediments, including carbonates. Hematite decreases abruptly right below the K-Pg \n\nboundary and almost disappears in biozone P1a. As expected, Danian carbonates are characterized by \n\nvery low SIRM values, due to the very low content of iron oxides. However, this low iron oxide content \n\nis not expected in the case of detrital material such as the marls of the top of the Maastrichtian. This \n\nsuggests that iron oxides in this stratigraphic interval may have been affected by dissolution, possibly \n\nrelated to environmental or climate changes (i.e. anoxia or acidification).  \n\nThe S-ratio parameter is indicative of the relative proportion between magnetite (low coercivity mineral) \n\nand hematite (high coercivity mineral). Therefore, values > 0.5 are indicative of a higher magnetite \n\ncontribution and values &lt;0.5 are indicative of a higher hematite contribution for the total remanence of \n\neach sample. S-ratio values at Zumaia range from 0.65 to 0.98 (Figure 4.3), which indicates a higher \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n26 \n\n \n\nmagnetite contribution along the entire section. However, this higher contribution of magnetite is much \n\nmore significant in the Danian carbonates and in the top 15 cm of Maastrichtian marls, where S-ratio \n\nvalues are 0.80-0.90 (Figure 4.3). Below the -15 cm, the contribution of hematite equals approximately \n\nthe contribution of magnetite, with S-ratio values around 0.65.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Magnetic data of ZU collection: Mass specific magnetic susceptibility (MS), Saturation Isothermal Remanent \n\nMagnetization (SIRM) of component 1 (detrital magnetite), component 2 (soft biomagnetite), component 3 (hard biomagnetite) \n\nand component 4 (hematite), S-ratio which is indicative of magnetite - hematite relative proportion. SIRM and S-ratio curves \n\nwere acquired by using the Kruiver et al. (2001) software. Absolute values are reported in Table 8.2. \n\n4.2 The PETM transition at Dababiya \n\nMass specific magnetic susceptibility is nearly cyclical along the entire section, varying between 3.12 x \n\n10-8 and 6.28 x 10-8 m3/kg (Figure 4.5), suggesting that MS is mostly controlled by climate parameters \n\nsuch as eustatism and Milankovitch cycles. However, the interval near the PETM boundary is \n\ncharacterized by abrupt shifts of higher values of MS, varying between 5.26 x 10-8 and 1.5 x 10-7 m3/kg \n\n(Figure 4.5). This abrupt and positive shift in MS, resulting from the absence of carbonates (diamagnetic \n\ncompound) and, consequently, higher relative abundance of ferromagnetic particles. Such acyclical and \n\nsudden changes cannot be explained by eustatism or Milankovitch cycles, but are rather the signature of \n\nthe abrupt climate change characterizing the PETM interval. \n\nFrequency-dependent susceptibility (Kfd) of Dababiya section vary essentially between 2-8% (Figure \n\n4.5), which is indicative of admixture of SP grains and coarser non-SP grains or eventually, SP grains \n\nunder 0.005 \u00b5m. There are also a few samples with Kfd values &lt;2%, which indicates the absence of SP \n\ngrains. Such values may suggest that Dababiya section was affected by bichemical processes. Negative \n\nand very high values (>14%) of Kfd are considered as measurement error and was dismissed from the \n\nanalysis. \n\nIRM measurements were carried out for all samples of Dababiya collection. The linear and gradient \n\nacquisition plots (LAP and GAP, respectively) of 6 representative samples are presented in Figure 4.4.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 - a) Linear Acquisition plot of Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) curves from six representative samples \n\nof the Dababiya section, unmixed by using the Kruiver et al.

The shaded area represents \n\nerror envelopes of 95% confidence intervals. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\nAfter unmixing IRM curves, four components were identified: two populations of magnetite \n\n(components 1 and 2), hematite and goethite.  \n\nLinear acquisition plots of IRM curves (Figure 4.4a) clearly shows the predominance of goethite along \n\nthe Dababiya section. The contribution of the other components is very small compared to the \n\ncontribution of goethite. As goethite is strongly coercive (Figure 4.4b), a higher magnetic field is \n\nrequired to saturate goethite, much higher than the maximum field induced by the equipment (~1.2 T).   \n\nTherefore, the IRM curve do not reach saturation at 1.2 T. A very distinct pattern of the linear and \n\ngradient acquisition plots is found for samples within the PETM interval (Db-36 and Db-39). In the \n\nPETM interval, the contribution of the magnetite is higher than the contribution of goethite. As \n\nmagnetite is a lower coercive mineral (Figure 4.4b), the sample reaches the magnetization of saturation \n\nbelow 1.2 mT.  \n\nUnmixed Isothermal remanent magnetization curves indicate the presence of three ferromagnetic \n\ncomponents in the whole Dababiya section, except in the PETM interval, where four components are \n\nidentified (Figure 4.4 and 4.5).  Component 1 has very low logarithmic values of mean coercivity (Log \n\nB1/2), ranging 1.2 \u2013 1.3 mT, and DP values between 0.25 and 0.37 mT, which are typical of detrital \n\nmagnetite (Egli, 2004).  Component 2 has Log B1/2 values ranging from 1.65 to 1.9 mT along the entire \n\nsection except in the PETM interval where Log B1/2 values are significatly lower (between 1.4 \u2013 1.55 \n\nmT). The DP of component 2 varies between 0.25 and 0.5 mT along the Dababiya section and it also \n\ndecreases in the PETM for values ranging 0.18 \u2013 0.26 mT. The values along the section are typical of \n\ndetrital magnetite (Egli, 2004). However, DP values &lt;0.2 mT found in the PETM interval (Figure 4.4 \n\nand 4.5) may also be suggestive of the presence of magnetossome. Component 3 has Log B1/2 values \n\nranging 2 \u2013 2.2 mT and DP values of 0.3 \u2013 0.45 mT which are typical of hematite. Finally, component \n\n4 is characterized by high Log B1/2 values, which vary between 2.86 \u2013 3.22 mT and, by DP values \n\noscilatting between 0.26 \u2013 0.47 mT, typical of goethite (Egli, 2004).   \n\nThe concentrations of magnetite 1, magnetite 2, hematite and goethite are represented in Figure 4.4a and \n\n4.5 as a function of their saturation remanent values (SIRM). The magnetite content is very low along \n\nthe Dababiya section except in the PETM interval where abrupt positive shifts are observed for both \n\ncomponents, magnetite 1 and magnetite 2. The concentration of hematite is below detection limit along \n\nthe section, except in the PETM interval where the SIRM of hematite is characterized by two prominent \n\npositive shifts. The increase of magnetite and hematite content in the interval near the PETM boundary \n\nresults from the absence of carbonates in Bed-1 and the very small carbonate content of Bed-2. \n\nCarbonates are diamagnetic compounds, so they do not contribute to the remanence. In addition, the \n\nmineralogy of beds -1 and -2 has a higher detrital affinity, namely clays, which generally host high \n\ncontents of ferromagnetic iron oxides. The SIRM curve of goethite is more variable than the SIRM \n\ncurves of the other components. However, a clear negative shift is identified in the interval above de \n\nPaleocene-Eocene boundary, indicating a lower content in goethite.   \n\nThe S-ratio is indicative of the relative proportion between the low (magnetite) and high (hematite and \n\ngoethite) coercive components. S-ratio values at Dababiya section are relatively constant, varying \n\nessentially between 0.1 and 0.3 (Figure 4.5), which reflects the dominant contribution of the higher \n\ncoercive components, principally goethite. As expected, this pattern is reversed in the interval above the \n\nPaleocene-Eocene boundary where S-ratio acquires values between 0.58 \u2013 0.98, indicating a higher \n\ncontribution of magnetite for the total remanence.   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 - Magnetic data for the Paleocene-Eocene transition at Dababiya: Mass Specific Magnetic Susceptibility (MS), Frequency Dependent Susceptibility (Kfd), Coercivity (logB1/2), \n\nSaturation Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (SIRM) and Dispersion Parameter (DP) for component 1 (detrital magnetite), component 2 (magnetite), component 3 (hematite) and component 4 \n\n(goethite) and S-ratio which is indicative of magnetite - hematite relative proportion. SIRM, log (B1/2) and S-ratio curves were acquired by using the Kruiver et al. (2001) software. The red interval \n\ncorresponds to the dissolution interval defined by Saleh (2013). Absolute values are reported in table 8.3.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nIn order to evaluate the presence of magnetosomes in the PETM interval, First-Order Reversal Curves \n\n(FORC) measurements were performed for two samples within the interval (Db-36 and Db-39). Indeed, \n\nmagnetofossils are generally characterized by very low DP values and a central narrow ridge typical of \n\nnon-interacting SD magnetite in FORC diagram (Abrajevitch et al., 2015). FORC results (Figure 4.6) \n\ndo not show any evidence of the typical narrow central ridge, suggesting the absence of biomagnetite. \n\nThe pattern obtained for both samples is similar and corresponds to the signature of SD particles. Since \n\nthere is no biomagnetite in the interval, the lower DP values previously described may reveal the \n\npresence of a very fine grain magnetite. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 First Order Reversal Curves (FORC) diagram for samples Db-36 and Db-39, revealing a single-domain signature \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n5. Discussion \n\nA continuous sedimentary record is one of the most important criterion to reconstruct past climate and \n\nenvironmental changes. Both sections, Zumaia and Dababiya, have been considered expanded and \n\ncomplete, and therefore representative of KPg and PETM events (Dinares-Turrel et al., 2003; \n\nBatemburg et al., 2014; Despuis et al., 2003; Aubry et al., 2007). However, Font et al. (2018) shown \n\nthat part of the early Danian, namely P0 and the lower part of P1(a1) biostratigraphic zones, is missing \n\nat Zumaia. At Dababiya, Schulte et al. (2011) observed that the GSSP occurred in a submarine channel, \n\nwhich was confirmed by Saleh (2013) who also identified significant lateral variations in lithology, \n\nsuggesting erosion and/or non-deposition. The non-continuity of both sections may introduce some \n\ndoubts about the viability of Zumaia and Dababiya as representative of the KPg and PETM events. \n\nHowever, both sections have excellent outcrops where the lithostratigraphic units can be easily \n\nidentified, characteristic mineralogical and geochemical contents, well preserved fossil records and \n\nother global and important proxies.  All these characteristics make both, Zumaia and Dababiya, good \n\nsections to reconstruct the past climate and environmental changes. However, the presence of hiatus in \n\nthe sections should be considered with caution in the interpretations.  \n\n5.1 The KPg transition at Zumaia \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Mass Specific Magnetic Susceptibility (MS) and Mineralogical Data of Zumaia samples (Z collection). The \n\nconcentration of Phyllosilicates, Quartz and Calcite is expressed as a percentage of the total mass of each sample (wt%). \n\nMineralogical data provided by Thierry Adatte. Absolute values are in table 8.4. \n\nA strong correlation of phyllosilicates and calcite with MS, suggest that MS is dominantly controlled by \n\nthe lithology, and thus may have a climate and environmental significance (Figure 5.1 and 5.2). \n\nFundamentally, MS is controlled by the balance between detrital input and carbonate productivity, \n\nwhich depends on the distance of the source, itself controlled by sea level changes. The several picks \n\nalong the Maastrichtian marls correspond to the turbidites deposits and therefore are not significant to \n\nexplain the paleoenvironmental changes. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Correlation between mass specific magnetic susceptibility and phyllosilicates (left) and calcite (right). The \n\nsamples corresponding to turbiditic deposits were not considered in the correlations. R2 is the determination coefficient, R2 = 1 \n\n- (SSresidual / SStotal) where SStotal is the total sum of squares and SSresidual is the sum of the squares of residuals. \n\nMineralogical data provided by Thierry Adatte. \n\nA high magnetic susceptibility level was found at the clay interval just above the KPg boundary in other \n\nKPg sections, namely at Gubbio (Italy) and Bidart (France) (Font et al., 2011, 2014; Abrajevitch et al., \n\n2015) (Figure 5.3). Since there is a hiatus on the basal part of the Danian limestones, indicated by the \n\nabsence of characteristic planctik foraminifera (Font et al., 2018), this level is not observed at Zumaia. \n\nActually, the level that marks the Maastrichtian-Danian boundary at Zumaia is characterized by very \n\nlow MS values (Figure 5.1) caused by a high content of secondary calcite observable in the field. Font \n\net al. (2018) interpreted this low MS level as a decollement level, filled by secondary calcite, providing \n\nan explanation for the presence of a hiatus at the base of Danian. \n\nA low MS interval characterized by loss in detrital and biogenic magnetite has also been clearly \n\nidentified below the KPg transition at Gubbio and Bidart (Lowrie et al., 1990; Font et al., 2011, 2014; \n\nAbrajevitch et al., 2015) (Figure 5.3). The first explanation for such a low magnetite interval was given \n\nby Lowrie et al. (1990) who interpreted this low content observed at Gubbio as a result from the \n\nreduction of iron oxide and subsequent removal of the Fe2+ ions. According to the author, the reduction \n\nmay be a consequence of downwards infiltration of reducing waters resulting from the large quantity of \n\norganic matter produced by the extinctions at the KPg boundary.  \n\nHowever, there is no evidence of reducing conditions at Bidart and Gubbio, leading Font et al. (2014) \n\nto suggest that the loss in magnetite rather result from particular environmental changes that prevailed \n\nat that time, where acidic weathering provides a plausible mechanism for iron oxide dissolution. \n\nIncreased acidity of meteoric water is a common consequence of large aerosol release during volcanic \n\neruptions (Abrajevitch et al., 2015). Under normal pH conditions (pH~5.6 for present-day rainwaters), \n\ndetrital magnetite can persist on the continental surface for several million years, but it is rapidly \n\ndissolved with decreasing pH (Font et al., 2014).  Using a geochemical weathering model (PREEQC) \n\non a regolith, Font et al. (2014) showed that the time required to dissolve 90% of the initial magnetite \n\nmass, during transportation from the sediment source area to the deposition site, is between 31,000 (pH \n\n3.3) and 68,000 yr (pH 4.3). Based on paleomagnetic data (Chenet et al., 2008; 2009), these values are \n\ncompatible with the temporal duration of the Deccan volcanic emissions. \n\nAlthough detrital magnetite loss may be explained by acid dissolution as consequence of the intense \n\nvolcanism, the decrease in biogenic magnetite cannot. Magnetotatic bacteria live in marine sediments \n\nand the pH of the ocean is rapidly buffered by carbonate cycle. A decrease in reactive iron (Fe2+) could \n\nlimit the growth of magnetotatic bacteria (Roberts et al., 2011). On the other hand, magnetotatic bacteria \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nlive at the oxic-anoxic interface, being very sensitive to variations in the ocean chemistry.  Therefore, \n\nthe loss of biogenic magnetite could be explained by a Fe2+ ocean input decrease or by changes in \n\nseawater/sediment chemistry. Since rivers are the main ocean suppliers of chemical species, they should \n\ntransport less Fe2+ to the ocean. However, because acid rains are promoting the dissolution of magnetite \n\non land, Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions are being produced and transported to the ocean. This suggests that \n\ndevelopment of magnetotatic bacteria, and consequently the production of magnetossomes, is not related \n\nto the supply of Fe2+ but rather to seawater/sediment chemistry (acidification). Actually, intense acid \n\nrains may promote variations in the chemocline, changing the oxic-anoxic interface, disturbing the \n\nmagnetotatic bacteria development.  \n\nUnmixed IRM curves obtained for the Zumaia section revealed the presence of four main magnetic \n\ncompounds: detrital magnetite, soft magnetite, hard magnetite and hematite. Having primary hematite \n\n(which is usually dark) in marine sediments is not very common. The red color of the rocks at Zumaia \n\n(Figure 2.1) suggest the presence of hematite pigments, which have a secondary origin. Therefore, the \n\nhematite origin is probably secondary, resulting from the oxidation of the primary magnetite during \n\ndiagenesis. Consequently, it has no significance to the paleoclimatic interpretations, in contrary to \n\ndetrital and biogenic (soft and hard) magnetite.  \n\nAt Zumaia, the low MS interval recorded at Gubbio and Bidart is not clearly observed (Figure 5.3), \n\nalthough a slight but significant gradual decrease in MS values was found 2 m below the KPg boundary \n\n(Figure 5.3). This slight MS decrease during the uppermost Maastrichtian and early Danian can be \n\ncomparable with the low MS interval at Gubbio and Bidart (Figure 5.3). Although a slight increase in \n\ncalcite content (from ~40 to ~50wt%) is observed (Figure 5.1), this mineralogical variation is too small \n\nto explain the observed MS decrease, suggesting that the sea level is not the only factor controlling the \n\nmagnetic susceptibility variations.  \n\nThe concentration of detrital magnetite is proportional in abundance to the detrital fraction \n\n(phyllosilicates) and therefore, Maastrichtian marls have higher contents of detrital magnetite and \n\nhematite than Danian carbonates (Figure 4.3). However, magnetite content (SIRM of comp. 1, 2 and 3) \n\nis abnormally low in the last 50 cm below the KPg boundary as well as in the first centimeters above \n\nthis limit, being comparable to the typical low values of the Danian limestones which do not have \n\nterrigenous affinity (Figure 4.3). Once again, the variations in mineralogy are not significant, being too \n\nsmall to explain such a low content in magnetite (Figure 5.1).  Therefore, I suggest that dissolution of \n\nferromagnetic iron oxides, rather than sea level, may control the decrease in magnetic susceptibility and \n\nmagnetite content, similarly to what has been observed in Bidart and Gubbio.  \n\nThese data provide further evidence of the influence of Deccan-induced climate perturbation at the dawn \n\nof the KPg mass extinction.  Furthermore, Abrajevitch et al. (2015) found biogenic magnetite, which is \n\nparticularly sensitive to reductive dissolution, between the KPg clay layer (with the iridium anomaly) \n\nand the low susceptible zone, at Gubbio and Bidart (Figure 5.4). This, together with the fact that the \n\nmagnetite depleted interval at Zumaia encompasses the KPg boundary (Figure 4.3 and 5.3), is \n\ninconsistent with the downward percolation of reducing fluids suggested by Lowrie et al. (1990). \n\nTherefore, the low susceptible zone more likely marks a different environmental event that preceded the \n\nimpact. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 \u2013 Correlation of a) the age of the Deccan lava flows in India (Schoene et al., 2014) with the KPg marine sections marked by b) the low MS interval at Gubbio (Italy); c) the low MS \n\ninterval containing akagan\u00e9ite at Bidart (France); d) the depletion in detrital and biogenic magnetite at Bidart; e) mercury anomalies at Bidart; f) the magnetite-depleted interval containing \n\nakagan\u00e9ite at Zumaia (Spain); and, g) mercury anomalies at Zumaia.  Modified from Font et al. (2018). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nThe link with the Deccan volcanism is also comforted by the presence of a rare chlorine-bearing iron \n\noxyhydroxide, akagen\u00e9ite, which was observed in the magnetite depleted interval at Gubbio and Bidart \n\n(Font et al., 2011; 2014) and later at Zumaia (Font et al., 2018). Akagan\u00e9ite is very rare on Earth, because \n\nits precipitation requires highly oxidizing, acidic and hyper-chlorinated environments, similar to those \n\npresent on Mars or in acid-sulphidic and volcanic settings on Earth (Font et al., 2018). The akagan\u00e9ite \n\nfounded at Zumaia is present not only below the KPg boundary as well just above this limit (Figure 5.3). \n\nHowever, the presence of akagan\u00e9ite above the KPg boundary may be suspicious due to the presence of \n\nsulfur in its composition. To address this problem, more Micro-Raman spectrometry analysis should be \n\nconducted in the future.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 \u2013 FORC characteristics of the KPg transition intervals at Gubbio and Bidart. The central ridge is indicative of the \n\npresence of magnetite magnetofossils. The central ridge is absent in samples from the low susceptible zone in both sections \n\nexcept in the 2cm below the KPg boundary at Gubbio and in samples from -2 to -12 cm interval at Bidart. Figure from \n\nAbrajevitch et al. (2015). \n\nThe occurrence of akagan\u00e9ite in the marine sediments of all three sections is exceptional, providing \n\nsupport for a volcanism related origin of the low susceptible zone. A plate-like shape well-embedded in \n\nconcordance with the deposition plane of the sediment, as well as the fact that akagan\u00e9ite does not fill \n\nfractures, suggest a primary depositional origin. The relatively well-preserved shape of the akageneite \n\ngrains compared to the severely altered aspect of the detrital iron oxides contained in the same sample \n\nargue for aeolian transportation (Font et al., 2017). These observations suggest that akagan\u00e9ite was \n\nformed in the Deccan volcanic plume and was further transported to the Atlantic and Tethys realms \n\nthrough the stratosphere (Font et al., 2017). \n\nAlso supporting the volcanic origin of the low susceptible zone is the presence of a mercury-rich level \n\nobserved at Bidart and Zumaia (Font et al., 2016; 2018) (Figure 5.3). Mercury (Hg) have been identified \n\nas an excellent indicator of massive volcanism in the marine sedimentary record (Font et al., 2016). \n\nMercury could enter marine sediments bound to clays, but its presence is usually related with the input \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\nof terrestrial organic matter. Font et al. (2016; 2018) showed that there was no correlation between Hg \n\nand total organic carbon or phyllosilicates, suggesting that Hg was deposited from the atmosphere, and \n\ntherefore that it has a volcanic provenience. \n\nDuring Mesozoic, Zumaia and Bidart were part of the Basque-Cantabric basin, located in the Atlantic \n\nOcean, while Gubbio was located in the Tethys realm. The presence of Deccan volcanic markers like \n\nmagnetite depletion, akagan\u00e9ite and Hg-rich levels in these sections thus suggest a rather global \n\nphenomenon. On a global scale, the low magnetite interval observed at Zumaia, Gubbio and Bidart, \n\ncorrelates with an abrupt increase of temperature (2-4\u00baC), beginning at 500 kyr and ending at ~20-50 \n\nkyr before the KPg boundary, recorded in fossil plants and foraminifera present in terrestrial and marine \n\nsections from North Dakota, respectively (Wilf et al., 2003). Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes from \n\npaleosol carbonates in Texas also point to an increase in temperature, accompanied by an elevated \n\natmospheric CO2 pressure, with CO2 levels ranging between 1000 and 1400 ppmV, in the 500 kyr prior \n\nto the KPg boundary (Nordt et al., 2003). In the South Atlantic, a short-term warming of 2-3\u00baC was also \n\nreported by carbon and oxygen isotopes below the KPg boundary (Li and Keller, 1998). This positive \n\nshift in temperature recorded worldwide is coincident with the Deccan main phase-2 (Figure 5.5). \n\nTherefore, the temperature anomaly is likely consequence of the huge amount of CO2 and other \n\ngreenhouse gases released during the second and most intense phase of Deccan eruptions. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 \u2013 Guembelitria cretacea blooms recorded from the eastern Tethys and Texas correlative with the three phases of \n\nDeccan volcanism. Phases 2 and 3 are associated with times of rapid warming in biozones CF1 and P1b. Phase-2 of the Deccan \n\neruptions and the warming in CF1 biozone correlates with the magnetite decrease interval observed at Zumaia in this study.  \n\nMoreover, the low contents of detrital and biogenic magnetite, correlates not only with the global \n\nwarming as well as with higher abundance of Guembelitrian cretacea, a disaster opportunist species \n\nthat was recorded in the eastern Tethys and Texas (Keller, 2014) (Figure 5.5). Blooms of this \n\nforaminifera consist of generally dwarfed specimens that dominate low diversity high-stress marine \n\nassemblages worldwide and are frequently accompanied by rapid climate changes and ocean \n\nacidification (Font et al., 2018).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nA decline in seawater 187Os/188Os ratio was also recorded throughout the global ocean just below the \n\nKPg boundary (Robinson et al., 2009) (Figure 5.6). The authors indicated the second (main) phase of \n\nDecan volcanism as the cause of such isotopic decline but the process by which volcanism could \n\ngenerate such isotopic anomaly was not described. The large difference in osmium isotope ratio between \n\ncontinental crust (~1.4) and mantle (~0.127) reservoirs could generate large seawater Os isotope \n\nvariations (Dickin, 2005; Percival et al., 2016). Actually, large igneous provinces have been associated \n\nto negative excursions in the marine Os isotope (Cohen &amp; Coe, 2002; Turgeon &amp; Creaser, 2008; Percival \n\net al., 2016). However, the specific pathway(s) for transfer unradiogenic osmium from LIP magmatism \n\nto the oceans is poorly constrained.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.6 \u2013 Comparison of proposed stratigraphic sequence of Deccan Basalts with proposed stages of volcanism from Chenet \n\net al. (2007) and 187Os/188Os data from Bottaccione (Gubbio, Italy). The same 187Os/188Os pattern was recorded at 3 more \n\ndifferent locations: DSDP Site 577 (Shatsky Rise, Western Pacific), ODP Site 690 (Maud Rise, Weddell Sea) and DSDP Site \n\n525 (Walvis Ridge, Atlantic), see Robinson et al. (2009). Figure from Robinson et al. (2009). \n\nThe isotopic composition of dissolved osmium in the oceans reflects mass balance between osmium \n\ninput from hydrothermal alteration of juvenile oceanic crust, average riverine input from continental \n\nweathering, together with a generally minor extraterrestrial contribution from meteorites and cosmic \n\ndust particles (Turgeon &amp; Creaser, 2008). Therefore, processes such as, continental weathering of basalt \n\nlava flows, low-temperature hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks or meteoritic \n\nimpacts/dissolution of cosmic dust have been indicated as possible causes for 187Os/188Os ratio \n\ndepletions (Sharma et al., 2000; Cohen &amp; Coe, 2002; Turgeon &amp; Creaser, 2008; Percival et al., 2016).  \n\nThe 187Os/188Os anomaly below the KPg boundary coincides in time with the second phase of Deccan \n\nvolcanism, when huge amounts of lava were extruded (Figure 5.6), and with the global warming and \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nconsequent weathering intensification. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the Os isotopic \n\nexcursion is the intensive weathering of Deccan basalts, which were located at subtropical latitudes at \n\nthat time. The dissolved radiogenic osmium would then enter the ocean by riverine input causing the \n\nglobal ocean anomaly after ocean homogenization.  \n\nRobinson et al. (2009) also recorded a decrease in bulk carbonate content that coincide with the Os \n\nisotope negative shift, suggesting that carbonate burial flux may have been lower during the 187Os/188Os \n\nratio decline. The authors speculated that diminished carbonate burial rate may have been the result of \n\nocean acidification caused by Deccan volcanism. Such theory is consistent with the hypothesis presented \n\nhere to explain the loss in magnetite in the interval below the KPg boundary. \n\nThe new data presented here supports an important climate event preceding the KPg boundary and \n\ncomfort previous results obtained in Bidart and Gubbio (Font et al., 2014, 2016). Volcanic markers like \n\nmagnetite dissolution previously identified in Bidart and Gubbio are confirmed here in the case of the \n\nZumaia section. Magnetite depletion also corroborates the presence of akagan\u00e9ite and Mercury at \n\nZumaia to support the volcanic theory. On a global scale, these markers correlate with global warming, \n\nan increase in atmospheric CO2, environmental acidification via acid rains and presence of high stress \n\nenvironments with opportunistic species blooms. This climate perturbation also corresponds to the age \n\nof the main Deccan eruptions recently dated by U-Pb method on zircon (Schoene et al., 2014) reinforcing \n\nthe link with the Deccan traps. These findings provide new clues to elucidate the origin of the KPg mass \n\nextinction.  \n\n5.2 The PETM transition at Dababiya \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 \u2013 Mass Specific Magnetic Susceptibility (MS) and Mineralogical Data of Dababiya samples. The concentration of \n\nPhyllosilicates, Quartz and Calcite is expressed as a percentage of the total mass of each sample. Absolute values are in table \n\n8.5. \n\nThe PETM interval defined by changes in MS is different in extend from the one defined by SIRM \n\n(Figure 5.8), showing clearly that such magnetic parameters are controlled by different sources. In fact, \n\nSIRM only depends on the presence of ferromagnetic particles in a sample. On the other hand, as \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nreferred is chapter 3, magnetic susceptibility depends not only on the concentration of ferromagnetic \n\nparticles but on all magnetizable material present in a sample which include ferromagnetic, diamagnetic \n\nand paramagnetic compounds (see topic 3.1). \n\nA strong relation between MS and mineralogy is clearly observed at Dababiya (Figure 5.7). The \n\nconcentration of the main mineralogical compounds, as well as the MS concentration, is nearly cyclical \n\nalong the section, suggesting that MS is mostly controlled by the balance between carbonate productivity \n\nand detrital input, in turn controlled by climate parameters such as the eustatism and the Milankovitch \n\ncycles. However, the interval near the PETM boundary is characterized by an acyclical, abrupt and \n\npositive shift in MS, resulting from the absence of carbonates (diamagnetic compounds) and higher \n\nrelative abundance of ferromagnetic particles. Such sudden changes cannot be explained by eustatism \n\nor Milankovitch cycles, suggesting that leaching of carbonate contents under acid conditions and/or \n\ndilution by increased detrital input may have disturbed the balance between carbonate productivity and \n\ndetrital input.   \n\nA magnetic approach has never been applied at Dababiya but several mineralogical and geochemical \n\nstudies have been carried out (Schulte et al., 2011, 2013; Khozyem et al. 2014, 2015; Keller et al., 2017). \n\nSchulte et al. (2011) interpreted this absence of calcite and concomitant phyllosilicate increase at \n\nDababiya as a result of severe carbonate dissolution, in addition to enhanced fluvial input due to erosion \n\nof coastal low lands, and deposition during a period of low or slightly rising sea level. Based on the \n\npaleotopography of the depositional basins, Khozyem et al. (2015) interpreted the PETM low \n\ncalcite/high detrital interval as a result of increased fluvial discharge into the Dababiya submarine \n\nchannel during a transgressive system tract period. This detrital input reported at Dababiya, characterizes \n\nnot only this section but several PETM sections worldwide (Bolle et al., 2000). Such global increase of \n\ndetrital content is attributed to the intense on-land weathering during a hot humid climate, which is \n\nsupported by a concomitant increase of the kaolinite in oceanic sediments (Bolle et al., 2000). \n\nUnmixed IRM curves indicated the presence of detrital magnetite and goethite in the whole Dababiya \n\nsection (Figure 4.4 and 5.8). The concentration of detrital magnetite is very low in the whole Dababiya \n\nsection except in the PETM interval where it increases considerably. As expected, this abrupt increase \n\nis consistent with the increase of the detrital components, phyllosilicates and quartz (Figures 5.7 and \n\n5.8). Goethite was interpreted as post-depositional and originating from the oxidation of pyrite. This \n\nmineral is much less abundant in the PETM interval, which could suggest that more oxic conditions \n\ninhibited the formation of pyrite at that time. However, Khozyem et al. (2015) reported the presence of \n\ndisseminated idiomorphic pyrite crystals and pyrite framboids in the PETM interval, showing that \n\nanoxic conditions prevailed. Higher values of V/Cr comfort the existence of anoxic conditions (Figure \n\n5.8). A more likely explanation to the low content in goethite is a better preservation of pyrite (and \n\nrelative lower production of goethite, due to a lower porosity of the corresponding sediments). \n\nTherefore, goethite may be interpreted as an indicator of anoxia and pyrite preservation at the PETM \n\ninterval. \n\nHematite is also present at Dababiya section, but its occurrence is restricted to the PETM interval (Figure \n\n4.4 and 5.8). The presence of goethite (high coercive mineral) may mask the signal of less coercive \n\nminerals, which means that hematite may be present along the whole section but with a very weak \n\nconcentration that are not detectable due to high concentrations of goethite. As well, the signal of \n\nmagnetite is very weak along the entire section except in the PETM interval, where the concentration of \n\ngoethite decreases.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.8 \u2013 Correlation between magnetic data from Dababiya section (Mass Specific Magnetic Susceptibility; concentration of detrital magnetite, hematite and goethite, expressed as a \n\nfunction of SIRM) and redox environmental conditions and anhydrite contents reported by Khozyem et al. (2015).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nNevertheless, the SIRM signal obtained for hematite has two distinct positive peaks. The second one \n\ncorrelates with the peak of magnetite and with a return to more oxic conditions, as noted by lower ratios \n\nof V/Cr (Figure 5.8). This, suggests that hematite may be secondary, resulting from the oxidation of \n\nmagnetite. However, the first and most prominent peak cannot be explained by the alteration of \n\nmagnetite because very anoxic conditions prevailed at that time and because magnetite content at that \n\nlevel is too low to explain the hematite peak.  \n\nThe magnetic data are insufficient to determinate the origin of such hematite but several hypotheses can \n\nbe discussed: (1) the first peak of hematite correlates with an abrupt decrease of detrital components \n\n(phyllosilicates and quartz) (Figure 5.7 and 5.8) and therefore a detrital origin is excluded; (2) hematite \n\ncan result from the oxidation of pyrite but the anoxic conditions (Figure 5.8) and the fact that pyrite is \n\nvery well preserved in the PETM interval lay down this hypothesis; (3) Hematite peak coincides with a \n\nprominent peak of anhydrite (Figure 5.8), which is usually originated in shallow waters due to intense \n\nevaporation. These environmental conditions are compatible with the formation of hematite but, once \n\nagain, oxic conditions would be required. At Dababiya, the formation of anhydrite under anoxic \n\nconditions seems to be related with ocean acidification due methane release (Khozyem et al., 2015), (4) \n\nfinally, the last and more likely explanation is the development of a Fe-rich level by leaching due to the \n\ncirculation of meteoric and diagenetic waters. Such enrichments typically occur at lithologic \n\ndiscontinuities due to porosity contrasts. Indeed, the hematite peak is located at the bottom of bed-1, \n\nright above the PE boundary which marks a change in lithology from marine hemipelagic to coarser \n\nsediments linked to increased fluvial discharge from shallower environments (Schulte et al., 2011). The \n\nformation of hematite is therefore post depositional and linked to the accumulation of Fe species, during \n\na return to more oxic conditions.  \n\nResuming, the magnetic properties of the Dababiya section represent reliable indicator of climate \n\nchanges, marking carbonate dissolution (i.e. high MS and SIRM values), detrital input (i.e. magnetite \n\ncontent) and anoxia (i.e. goethite content). \n\nConcerning the nature and origin of the PETM climate perturbations, an extreme ocean warming starting \n\nin the final stage of Paleocene was reported worldwide by several authors. Based on TEX86 and oxygen \n\nisotope records from planktonic foraminifera, Zachos et al. (2006) estimated a sea surface temperature \n\nincrease of 8\u00baC on the eastern margin of North America. Thomas et al. (2002) reported a period of \n\ngradual surface-water warming, infered on high-resolution analysis of single planktonic and benthic \n\nforaminiferal shells from the Weddel Sea (Southern Ocean). Tripati &amp; Elderfield (2004) indicated a \n\n3.5\u00ba-4\u00baC increase of sea surface temperatures infered by high-resolution temperature records of Mg/Ca \n\nratios of planktonic foraminifera across the PE boundary in the equatorial Pacific and subtropical \n\nAtlantic. The period of ocean warming in the late Paleocene is also characterized by a significant global \n\nsea level rise (~20 m), which may have resulted from the melting of high-altitude or polar ice caps \n\n(specially small alpine ice sheets on Antarctida), thermal expansion of the oceanic water column (which \n\ncould explained a maximum rise of 8 m), or both (Speijer and Wagner, 2002; Sluijs et al., 2008).  \n\nThe North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) volcanism has been indicated as the main cause for the \n\nocean warming starting at the Paleocene. Ash deposits and a large drop in sediment 187Os/188Os ratio \n\nwere reported at Svalbard Archipelago (Norway) in the onset of the PETM event (Wieczorek et al., \n\n2013). Contrary to the Os anomaly reported near the KPg boundary (see topic 5.1), the low 187Os/188Os \n\nratio of the PETM is not global in extend, being restricted to the North Atlantic area. It should be taken \n\ninto account that isotopic Os measurements near the KPg transition were carried out for sea water and \n\nthe isotopic Os ratios infered by Wieczorek et al. (2013) were reported in sediments thus, a local \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nanomaly could only be expected. Wieczorek et al. (2013) suggest that the negative Os excursion that \n\nstarted in the late Paleocene resulted from both, direct input of ash (carring low 187Os/188Os ratios) to the \n\nbasin and rapid terrestrial weathering of the ash deposited on land during the NAIP volcanism.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9 \u2013 Correlation between mercury concentration (Hg Xmean) and total organic carbon (TOC) along the Dababiya \n\nsection. The resulting curve (Hg/TOC) shows a Hg-rich level which is not related with the concentration of organic compounds. \n\nData provided by Thierry Adatte.  \n\nIn order to check a volcanic origin linked to the NAIP for the PETM, I present here mercury data \n\n(provided by Thierry Adatte), which reveal that the PETM dissolution interval is also characterized by \n\nsignificant Hg enrichments. Two major Hg anomalies were identified in bed-1 and bed-2 at the Dababiya \n\nsection (Figure 5.9). The Hg anomaly of bed-2 dissapears after normalization by TOC (Figure 5.9), \n\nsuggesting that this peak results from organic matter scavenging. On the other hand, the Hg anomaly of \n\nbed-1 remains after normalization (Figure 5.9), suggesting that it resulted from higher atmospheric Hg \n\ninput into the marine realm, rather than organic matter scavenging and/or increased run off. The presence \n\nof the Hg peak at the beginning of PETM also supports the role of volcanism (NAIP) to initiate the \n\nconcomitant warming and sea-level rise that mark the beginning of the PETM.  \n\nThe PETM interval is characterized by an important negative carbone isotope excursion (CIE), which \n\npermits identification and correltion of this event globally. The magnitude and shape of this excursion \n\nvaries worldwide from abrupt (mostly) to gradual negative shifts. Based on the organic (?13Corg ) and \n\ninorganic (?13Ccarb ) carbon isotopes, Khozyem et al. (2015) characterized the CIE at Dababiya in three \n\nmain phases: 1) gradual decrease, 2) CIE minimum and 3) gradual recovery (Figure 5.10). The inorganic \n\ncarbon ratio reach minimum values ~60 cm below the PE boundary whereas organic carbon reach the \n\nminimum value in the middle of bed-2, ~70 cm above the PE boundary.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.10 \u2013 correlation between mass specific magnetic susceptibility (MS) and inorganic (?13Ccarb) and organic (?13Corg) \n\ncarbon isotope data from Khozyem et al. (2015). MS dissolution interval coincides with the minimum values of the CIE that \n\ncharacterize the PETM. \n\nThe global decrease in the ?13C have been related with the destabilization of clathrates stored in the \n\ncontinental shelf, which released large quantities of methane into the water column and atmosphere. \n\nOxidation of the methane species would have produced strongly 13C-depleted CO2. Consequently, \n\ncarbonates had precipitated with low ?13C values, which could account for the ?13Ccarb CIE-minimum \n\nsignificantly before the ?13Corg CIE-minimum. Moreover, the oxidation of methane gas had consumed \n\nsea water oxygen originating the first anoxia event observed at the base of the PETM interval (Figure \n\n5.8) (Khozyem et al. 2015). \n\nThre most obvious mechanism for clathrates destabilization is the ocean warming and sea level rise \n\nidentified in the beginning of the PETM event as consequence of NAIP volcanism Although clathrates \n\nare very sensitive to temperature and sea level variations, according with Svensen et al., (2004), a large \n\nscale hydrate melting as the one observed in the PETM, recquires a major triggering mechanism, \n\nproposing for the first time a link between contact metamorphism and the PETM event. According with \n\nSvensen et al. (2004), the intrusion of voluminous mantle-derived melts in carbon-rich sedimentary \n\nstrata in the northeast Atlantic may have caused an explosive release of methane-transported to the ocean \n\nor atmosphere through vent complexes. The authors also found that similar volcanic and metamorphic \n\nprocesses may explain climate events associated with other LIP such as the Siberian Traps and the Karoo \n\nIgneous Province. \n\nThe ocean warming, the NAIP volcanism and the methane release led to changes in ocean chemistry. \n\nUsing boron-based proxies for surface ocean carbonate chemistry, Penman et al. (2014) presented the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nfirst evidence for a drop in the pH surface (~0.3 units) and thermocline seawater, which had persisted at \n\nleast 70 kyr. Zachos et al. (2005) had also reported a significant shoaling of the carbonate compensation \n\ndepht (CCD) by 2000 m, at five different South Atlantic deep-sea sections.  \n\nThe delayed ?13Corg CIE-minimum coincides with the maximum content of organic matter (Figures 5.9 \n\nand 5.10), which appears to be of terrestrial origin and thus reflects the delayed response of the \n\ncontinental environment to the huge light carbon input into the atmosphere (Khozyem et al. 2015). In \n\nfact, the additional CO2 resulted in global hot humid conditions and increased precipitation (Bolle et al., \n\n2000). Therefore, the resulted weathered terrestrial materials have been carried out to the oceans by \n\nstreams and fluvial discharges, increasing the input of terrestrial organic matter (Schulte et al., 2011). \n\nAccording with Khozyem et al. (2015), the intensive continental weathering led also to an increase in \n\nthe nutrients flux from land to the ocean, which associated with ocean surface productivity, activated \n\nthe biological bump, thus decreasing ocean acidity.  \n\nHowever, the mechanism and rate by which the excess of carbon was removed from the atmosphere and \n\noceans is ambiguous and poorly constrained. The brevity (150-220 kyr) of the PETM event reflects the \n\nrapid enhancement of negative feedback mechanisms within Earth\u2019s exogenic carbon cycle that served \n\nthe dual function of buffering ocean pH and reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels (Kelly et al., \n\n2005).  \n\nOne of the most prominent hypotheses in this regard is that a sharp increase in marine biological \n\nproductivity and an associated increase in export production (flux of biologically produced organic \n\ncarbon from the surface ocean to the deep ocean) resulted in a drawdown of atmospheric CO2 \n\nconcentrations (Bains et al., 2000; Zachos &amp; Dickens, 2000; Khozyem et al., 2014, 2015). However, \n\nTorfefstein et al. (2010) re-evaluated the \u201cproductivity feedback hypothesis\u201d, based on biogenic barium \n\nmass accumulation rates, and found that any increase export production lagged the initial carbon release \n\nby at least ~70 kyr and thus, export production did not facilitate a rapid removal of the excess of carbon \n\nfrom the atmosphere. The authors indicated silicate weathering as the most likely mechanism for carbon \n\nremoval. On the other hand, Bowen et al. (2010) found that the rate of recovery is an order of magnitude \n\nmore rapid than that expected for carbon drawdown by silicate weathering alone, suggesting that the \n\naccelerated sequestration of organic carbon could reflect the regrowth of carbon stocks in the biosphere \n\nor shallow lithosphere that were released at the onset of the event.  \n\nThe recovery phase of the carbon isotope excursions is coincident with a recovery of goethite \n\nconcentration and with the return to more oxic conditions (Figures 5.8 and 5.10). Since pyrite crystals \n\nfound at Dababiya precipitated due to bacterian activity (Khozyem et al., 2015), an increase in biological \n\nproductivity would be consistent with the increase in pyrite content, which may suffer alteration to form \n\ngoethite under oxic conditions. Such data reinforces the idea of goethite as an indicator of anoxia in the \n\nPETM interval. \n\nThe magnetic data and the three phases described above for the ?13C evolution, correlate well with the \n\nbiostratigraphy of Dababiya section, which shows major turnovers across the PETM interval (Ernst et \n\nal., 2006; Khozyem et al., 2014; Keller et al., 2017). The biostratigraphic zone P5 is coincident with the \n\ngradual decrease of the ?13C values and marks the onset of the PETM, with a 40% increase in planktic \n\nforaminifera species diversity (from 21 to 35), but also a slight decrease in the abundance of these \n\nspecies (Figure 5.11) (Khozyem et al., 2014; Keller et al., 2017). Planktic foraminifera and calcareous \n\nnannofossils temporarily dissappeared in biostratigraphic zone E1, right above the PE boundary, \n\nsuggesting warming and surface ocean acidification. Assemblages returned after the PETM interval, in \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nthe carbon isotope excursion recovery phase, with no significant extinctions and underwent evolutionary \n\ndiversification (Figure 5.11) (Keller et al. 2017).  Although an exctinction of benthic foraminifera had \n\nbeen reported during the PETM probably due to the shoal of CCD (Alegret et al., 2009), no significant \n\nextinctions were found at Dababiya (Khozyem et al., 2014; Keller et al., 2017).     \n\n \n\nFigure 5.11 \u2013 Representative Planktic foraminifera species, calcareous nannofossils and carbon stable isotopes (?13Corg and \n\n?13Ccarb) at Dababiya section. Figure from Khozyem et al. (2014). \n\nThe magnetic data presented here fully supports the existence of an ocean acidification event starting \n\nbelow the PE boundary. The interval where ?13C reach minimum values coincides with the PETM \n\ninterval defined in this project based on MS variations (Figure 5.10), demonstrating the reliability of \n\nmagnetic data as a proxy to identify important acidification events. In addition, the decrease of goethite \n\nduring the PETM and its increase during the recovery phase of the carbon isotope excursion, \n\ndemonstrate that goethite may be a good proxy to identify not only the anoxic conditions in the PETM \n\nbut also the increase of biological productivity that marks the recovery of the PETM event. \n\nAt Zumaia, low contents in detrital magnetite demonstrated to be an excellent proxy to identify \n\nenvironmental acidification on the continent, leading to dissolution of detrital magnetite inland. At \n\nDababiya, such decrease in detrital magnetite is not observed, indicating distinct climate processes. In \n\nfact, in the end of Cretaceous period, large quatities of carbon were inputed directly into the atmosphere, \n\nleading to environmental acidification via acid rains affecting continental surface. In the PETM, large \n\nquantities of carbon were mainly released to the ocean, leading to ocean acidification. The order of \n\nmagnitude of both acidification events is significantly different because in the oceans, pH is rapidly \n\nbuffered by carbonate dissolution. Penman et al. (2014), estimated a drop of ~0.3 units in the pH ocean. \n\nSuch decrease is insufficient to explain magnetite dissolution, which recquires pH values of ~3-4 units \n\n(Font et al., 2014; White et al., 1994). \n\nThe anomalous interval of magnetite content correlates with foraminifera desappearence, corroborating \n\nthat severe chemical changes (acidification) occurred in the surface ocean during the PETM. Moreover, \n\nmagnetic data well correlates with the onset of a mercury anomaly, supporting the rule of volcanism \n\n(NAIP) to initiate the PETM event. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n5.3 KPg and PETM events: link with the Anthropocene? \n\nThe Anthropocene is defined as the geological period where human activity influenced the Earth\u2019s \n\nclimate. Humans have been responsible for recent major alterations of Earth\u2019s natural state (Ruddiman, \n\n2008). Climate warming due to fossil fuel burning is indicated as the cause for the increased rate of \n\nextreme climate events, melting of polar glaciers and significant rising sea level. Scientists also \n\nrecognize the accelerated rate of modern species extinctions, arguing that humans are now causing the \n\nsixth mass extinction (Barnosky et al., 2011). As rapid reductions in anthropogenic carbon emissions \n\nseem increasingly unlikely in the near future, forecasting the Earth systems response to ever-increasing \n\nemission rates has become a high-priority focus of climate research. \n\nGeologic analogues from past transient climate changes, such as the KPg mass extinction and the PETM \n\nevents, could provide invaluable constraints on the response of the present-day climate system. \n\nIndependently of having different sources (volcanism, methane release or fossil fuel burning), all of \n\nthese events have in common the massive input of greenhouse gases into the ocean-atmosphere system \n\nand consequent climate warming. However, the current climate warming is happening at rates 12 to 16 \n\ntimes faster. The modern rate of change in atmospheric concentration is greater than 200 ppmv per \n\ncentury and is still increasing. Moreover, at current rates of fossil fuel burning, atmospheric CO2 levels \n\nwill reach Cretaceous levels of 2 times the pre-industrial level about 2070 and 8 times the pre-industrial \n\nlevel shortly after 2300 (Hay, 2010).  \n\nSuch data are quite alarming and the first climate consequences from the huge inputs of greenhouse \n\ngases linked to human activities are now ongoing. Ozone depletion and particle pollution from fossil \n\nfuel burning and other human activities result in dust clouds that trap solar radiation in Earth\u2019s \n\natmosphere with lower reflection back to space, thus contributing to increase Earth\u00b4s temperature. \n\nSimilar to the KPg and PETM events, present-day CO2 concentrations from the atmosphere are absorbed \n\nin the oceans and has already lowered the pH. Ocean acidification is already affecting shelly organisms \n\nat the base of the food chain and endangering all life up to the food chain (Keller et al., 2017). \n\nBased on the KPg and PETM geological records, two future scenarios can be presumed. The worst-case \n\nscenario is the one similar to the KPg, when the environmental changes led to a severe mass extinction. \n\nSince the actual greenhouse input rates are much higher than the ones estimated for the Cretaceous, a \n\nfuture mass extinction would be expected to happen with a faster rate. The best-case scenario would be \n\nsimilar to the PETM event, where no significant extinctions were reported. Nevertheless, the Earth \n\nwould suffer a period of extreme environmental stress marked by intense heat, extreme climate events, \n\nrising sea level and severe food shortages reducing population and forcing migration to higher latitudes \n\nfor survival (Keller et al., 2017).  \n\nAccording to Ruddiman (2008), we are now ~0.7\u00baC of the way into this huge new experiment in \n\ntransforming our planet. Political and social efforts have been made to reduce the greenhouse gas \n\nemissions in some countries. The possibility of altering Earth\u00b4s future climate by engineering has also \n\nbeen discussed in the scientific community specially during the last decade (Figueroa et al., 2007; Getter \n\net al. 2009; Szulczewki et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013). Unless technology or extreme conservation efforts \n\nintervene, Earth is headed toward a warmer future at rates that are unprecedented in its 4.5-billion-year \n\nhistory. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\n6. Conclusions  \n\nThe magnetic results obtained for both sections, Zumaia and Dababiya, correlate very well with \n\nbiostratigraphic, mineralogical and geochemical data from previous studies at different sections \n\nworldwide, demonstrating not only the reliability of the data as well as the global dimension of both \n\nevents.  \n\nThe magnetic data acquired in this project provided new insights to identify periods of severe \n\nenvironmental change in the global sedimentary record as well as new constrains about the KPg and \n\nPETM events: \n\n(i) Magnetic susceptibility revealed to be a good proxy to identify important acidification events. \n\n(ii) Abnormally low contents of detrital magnetite at Zumaia are likely the result of continental \n\nmagnetite dissolution by acid rains.  \n\n(iii) A change in seawater/sediment chemistry due environmental acidification would suppress the \n\ndevelopment of magnetotatic bacteria in the interval below the KPg. \n\n(iv) Several proxies such as akageneite, Hg-rich levels, 187Os/188Os and atmospheric CO2 pressure link \n\nthe low susceptibility interval found at Zumaia with an acceleration of eruption rates of the \n\nDeccan volcanism recently dated with accuracy by U-Pb dating zircon.  \n\n(v) Contrary to Gubbio and Bidart, the magnetite depleted interval found at Zumaia (as well as the \n\noccurrence of akagan\u00e9ite) encompasses the KPg boundary, reinforcing the contribution of the \n\nDeccan volcanism to the KPg mass extinction. \n\n(vi) Overall, the magnetic data acquired for Zumaia section corroborates the existence of a severe \n\nperiod of environmental changes prior to the KPg boundary, which certainly contributed to the \n\nCretaceous mass extinction. The impact that succeeded such climate changes, likely exacerbated \n\nclimate warming and may have intensified Deccan eruptions. However, precise contribution of \n\neach catastrophic event in the massive extinction of the end of the Cretaceous period is still under \n\ndebate. \n\n(vii) Dababiya MS interval correlates with the CIE-minimum phase and calcite and foraminifera \n\ndisappearance, supporting an ocean acidification starting below the PE boundary. \n\n(viii) Mercury enrichments at the beginning of PETM together with negative excursions of 187Os/188Os \n\nsupports the role of volcanism (NAIP) to initiate the concomitant warming and sea level rise that \n\nmark the beginning of the PETM. \n\n(ix) Low contents of goethite in the PETM interval are indicative of pyrite preservation due to \n\nlithological contrast. However, high contents of goethite above the PETM interval support the \n\nincrease in biological productivity theory as the main feedback mechanism leading to the end of \n\nPETM event, and therefore represent a good indicator of anoxia.  \n\n(x) Higher values of magnetite are the result of low calcite/high detrital interval that characterizes the \n\nPETM. \n\n(xi) Concentration patterns of detrital magnetite indicate that, although both events (KPg and PETM) \n\nwere triggered by a massive release of CO2, the resulted climate processes were distinct.  \n\n(xii) Similar (or even more severe) climate changes of those occurred at the KPg and PETM are \n\nexpected to occur in the future, unless technology or extreme conservation efforts intervene. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n7.
