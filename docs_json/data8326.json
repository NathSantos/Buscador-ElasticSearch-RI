Introduction \n\nSolving the linkage between the lithic constituents of tombs and \nthe rock outcrops is a problem that has not been extensively \naddressed in the literature (Andrefsky, 1994; Clarkson and \nBellas, 2014). The project \u201cMEGAGEO: Moving megaliths in \n\nthe Neolithic\" gathered a multidisciplinary team, including \ngeologists and archaeologists in a new approach to address this \nissue. \n\nBased on a database of tombs from Portugal, a set of three \nstudy areas was chosen to conduct detailed analyses aiming to \nidentify and characterize outcrops and quarries that might have \nbeen the source of the lithic components used in the construction \nof the tombs. Figure 1 displays the studied areas named \nMonforte, Redondo and Lisboa after the main localities in their \n\nvicinities.  \nGeological studies included detailed mapping, petrographic \n\nand geochemical analysis of samples from outcrops, quarries and \ntombs to fully characterize each area.  A geographic information \nsystem was designed and implemented to visualize the collected \ndata and to produce field maps. In the phase of data analysis the \nspatial information gathered was consolidated and transformed \ninto a spatial data warehouse. This approach is being proposed by \n\nmany researchers and institutions as can be seen in Bedard and \nHan (2009), Stefanovic (1997) or McHugh (2008). In this paper \nwe present the results of this approach, using the geochemical \nresults obtained in the Redondo area as a case study. \n\n2. The data sources \n\nThe geographic information system created uses several data \nsources where spatial information (e.g. tomb location or sample \nlocation) coexist with non-spatial information (e.g. SiO2 content \nof a sample or geological description of an outcrop).  \n\nArtigo original \nOriginal article \n\n\n\n80  Nogueira et al. / Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es Geol\u00f3gicas (2015) 102, 1, 79-82 \n\n \n\nFor this project a total of twenty two databases were adapted \nor newly created. These databases include geographic \ninformation (e.g. roads, rivers, terrain slope, localities), \n\ngeological information, such as geological mapping at scales 1:50 \n000, 1:500 000 and 1:1 000 000, including rock formations and \nstructures, archaeological information (e.g. location and types of \ntombs, tomb description, site sketch), and petrographic and \ngeochemical data from samples collected in tombs and outcrops. \nFigure 2 shows the general organization of the GIS database \nsystem created.  \n\nThis data organization proved to be valuable in the phase of \n\nfield campaigns and data collection as it was possible to rapidly \nproduce maps to support field work and some synthesis maps \nneeded when presenting the results in conferences (e.g. \nBoaventura et al., 2015). Our experience demonstrated that this \napproach is suitable for a system that is operated by GIS-\nspecialists but whenever it is necessary to carry out data analysis \nfrom the point of view of non GIS-specialists, the complexity of \nthe data structure becomes difficult to use. The maintenance of \n\nsuch a system is also a time consuming task because data \nconsistency must be kept at all time whenever there are many \nresearchers adding data to the system. In terms of databases \nterminology the GIS-database system is considered a SOLTP \nsystem that is a Spatial Online Transactional Process because the \ndata is handled as a transactional system.  \n\nThe spatial data warehouse was created to help the \nresearchers of the project with a set of tools that might be usable \n\nin data analysis without the need to spend considerable amounts \nof time understanding all the operations and terminology specific \nto GIS systems. This approach implies the passage from a \nSOLTP to a more analytical system, that is, a Spatial Online \nAnalytical Process, a SOLAP (Kimball and Ross, 2002; Bedard \nand Han, 2009).   \n\n \n\n \nFig. 1.

The Spatial Data Warehouse \n\nTwo datamarts were designed to respond to the geologists and \nthe archaeologists questions. The geology datamart has got a fact \ntable that is centered on the samples collected and the dimensions \n\npresent include the outcrops, the tombs, the geology and the \ngeography. For the archaeology datamart the fact table is \ncentered in the tomb and as dimensions there is the geology, the \npetrography, the geochemistry and the geography. \n\nMcHugh (2008) classified the dimensions of GIS databases \nas geometric, non-geometric and mixed according to the type of \ndata contained. The transformation of these dimensions from the \nGIS database to a spatial data warehouse implies a process of \nExtraction, Transformation and Loading - ETL of information \n\n(Harvey and Jiawei, 2009). This ETL process includes several \ntypes of operations such as aggregation, filtering, aliasing or \ngeocoding. An example of this is the transformation of chemical \nweight percentage of elements to a normalized description, \nallowing the archaeologists to understand the meaning of \ngeochemical data and common names used in its description, \naliasing. \n\nThe ETL stage is error prone, complex and time consuming \n\nas the studied areas include all types of rocks and the \ninterpretation needed for the geochemical and petrographic \nvalues and descriptions of sedimentary, metamorphic or igneous \nrocks is very different. An example is the creation of a set of \nfields for rock classification according to the geochemical \ncontents of analyzed samples. For example classifying the acidity \nof a rock is based on the values of SiO2 leading to common \nnames of mafic, intermediate or felsic. This transformation is \n\nmade using an expression of the type: \n \n\nIF((\u201cSIO2\u201d)&lt;= 52, 'MAFIC', IF((\u201cSIO2\u201d)&lt;63, \n'INTERMEDIATE',  'ACID'))* \n\n* QGIS type expression. Field names are between double quotes. \n\nThis transformation can only be applied in meaningful terms \nto igneous rocks, therefore a filtering of these types of rocks is \nnecessary previously to the step of rock classification. Fig. 3 is an \nexample of a map where the samples are classified according to \ntheir silica content. \n\n4. The outputs \n\nThe Redondo area is presented as a case study of this approach. \nA set of thirty two dolmens can be found and eight of these were \nselected for detailed studies in the project. The outcrops of the \narea were mapped to find the ones that might have produced rock \n\nslabs used in the construction of the dolmens: the source rocks.   \nFigure 3 displays a map constructed in QGIS under the \n\nspatial data warehouse created for the project. In this map a \nbuffer with a 250 m radius was displayed confirming that the \nfound outcrops are in an easily reachable distance for rock slab \ntransportation and seven out of eight of the studied dolmens are \nwithin this range. Furthermore, this map displays the silica \ncontent from the rock slabs and from the outcropping rock type. \n\nThis analysis demonstrates that there is a good match between \noutcrop rock type and rock slab silica content. Nevertheless, \nfurther analysis needs to be done in the dolmen from the \nnortheast part of the map where the rock slab is of basic \ncomposition whereas outcropping rocks are more felsic. \n\nThe spatial data warehouse also pretends to be useful for data \nanalysis, therefore, for the data visualization it is necessary to \ninclude background map information. This background \n\ninformation, that is predefined, must be prepared including the \n \n\n \nFig. 3. Example of a map displaying the buffered distance between outcrops and tombs in the Redondo area. \n\nFig. 3. Exemplo de um mapa onde \u00e9 mostrada a \u00e1rea a igual distancia entre afloramentos e sepulcros na \u00e1rea do Redondo. \n\n \n\n\n\n82  Nogueira et al. / Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es Geol\u00f3gicas (2015) 102, 1, 79-82 \n\n \n\nset of legends and labels for specific uses. An example of this is \nthe set of geological maps with the standardized symbols and \nnames of the geological units in Portuguese and English. Also for \n\npublishing purposes the different symbols were created in gray \nshades and in full color.  \n\nAnother example of a possible analysis done with the spatial \ndata warehouse is the visualization of data based on a set of rules. \n\nWhen the geologists team wants to verify if it is necessary to \nconsider further sampling and analyses of REE and isotopes it is \npossible to prepare a map were the analyzed samples are plotted \n\nand the values displayed in a suitable geological background. \nFigure 4 illustrates an example of the output map produced for \nthe Redondo study area. In this map a filtering is done to display \nonly the samples analyzed for \n\n87\nSr/\n\n86\nSr and La/Lu ratio. \n\n \n\n \nFig. 4.

This map allows evaluating the relation between geochemistry, petrography and tomb location. \n\nFig. 4.

Conclusions \n\nIn a multidisciplinary project such as the one presented, new \ntools have to be developed in order to find common means for \nanalyzing and interpreting data.  \n\nThe spatial data warehouse specially created for the project is \nbeing used has a better tool in the analysis of the complex and \nmultidimensional data that is used to find the relation between \ntomb sites and lithic material sources. The interpretation of the \ngeochemistry and petrology of the samples can be combined with \nthe archaeological information by all the researchers of the \nproject without the need of high skills and knowledge of GIS. \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work is part of the project PTDC/EPH-ARQ/3971/2012 \nfunded by the European Fund FEDER and COMPETE \u2013 \n\nPrograma Operacional Fatores de Competitividade (POFC). \n\nReferences \n\nAndrefsky, W., 1994.
