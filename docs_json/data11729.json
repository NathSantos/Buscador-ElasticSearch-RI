The objective of this study \n\nwas to evaluate soil matric potential using mercury tensiometer and puncture digital tensiometer, \n\nand to compare the gravimetric soil moisture values obtained by tensiometric system with \n\ngravimetric soil moisture obtained by neutron attenuation technique.

Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.32, n.3, p.467-478, maio/jun. 2012 \n\n468 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe soil has the capacity to store water in its pores and provide part of it to the plants to the \n\nextent of their needs. Through monitoring of matric water potential in the ground, it is possible to \n\ndetermine the amount of water needed to be replaced to the plants by irrigation. The appropriate \n\nirrigation can significantly reduce the amount of water applied, in order to minimize loss of water \n\nand soil, increase crop yield and reduce production costs. \n\nThere are direct and indirect methods to determine soil moisture. The best known direct \n\nmethod is the gravimetric method and, among the indirect, it has the electrical resistance blocks, \n\nneutron probe, gamma radiation, tensiometry, psychrometrics, computed tomography and time \n\ndomain reflectometry (ALBUQUERQUE &amp; DUR\u00c3ES, 2008). \n\nThe gravimetric method is considered standard, however, involves collecting soil samples for \n\neach measure, making it laborious and impacting to the environment, because of the constant \n\nremoval of soil from the area. This method does not allow the measure replicates in the same place, \n\ntherefore, it is not suitable for evaluation which require many steps over time (CICHOTA et al., \n\n2008). \n\nThere are three direct ways to measure the influence of soil water content on matric potential. \n\nThey are: Richards pressure chamber, Haines funnel and tensiometer (LIBARDI, 2005). \n\nAlthough the three methods use a porous plate, the only one that allows direct measurement in \n\nthe field is the tensiometer. Its working principle is based on the balance between the capillary \n\nforces and adsorption which occur because of the interaction between water and solid soil particles. \n\nThe use of a tensiometer has the advantage of indicating the time and amount of irrigation \n\nwater to be applied to the soil, which requires knowledge of soil water retention curve. \n\nSince its inception, the original version of the tensiometer has been showing modifications \n\n(WHALLEY et al., 2009), especially in the reading system and the constituent materials, which \n\nhave as their objective to facilitate the installation of equipment in the field, improve its operation, \n\nmaintenance and response time, and facilitate reading by the operator. \n\nThe reading system may be indicated by a manometer in the form of U-tube with water or \n\nmercury, or a mechanical or electrical indicator (REICHARDT &amp; TIMM 2004). \n\nThe conventional tensiometer uses as reading system the mercury column manometer, and a \n\ndirect measurement of matric potential. However, it has disadvantages, such as toxicity of mercury, \n\nthe manual accomplishment of readings, with the possibility of visual error in reading by the \n\noperator, and the need for constant maintenance of the apparatus to eliminate air bubbles inside the \n\ntensiometer. \n\nThe tensiometer of mercury manometer is used for research purposes, however, for practical \n\npurposes, as its use in the field, presents operational difficulties. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate a \n\nreading system that facilitates its use. \n\nTo facilitate the operation and maintenance of a tensiometer, a pressure transducer with \n\ndigital reading (MARTHALER et al., 1983) has been developed, which measures the tension in the \n\ntensiometric tube, and whose values are displayed on a digital display. \n\nThe development of new methodologies and tools that allow determining the soil water \n\ncontent is of great importance for agronomic knowledge and scientific research (TEIXEIRA et al., \n\n2005). \n\nAnother technique for determining the soil water content is the neutron moderation, which \n\nallows the soil water content to be obtained directly, with minimal change in the soil profile, at any \n\ntime and in a fast and practical way. Its disadvantage is the cost of equipment. However, few studies \n\nin the literature compare the effectiveness of these technologies in the determination of soil water \n\ncontent. \n\n\n\nMeasurement systems of soil water matric potential and evaluation of soil moisture under different irrigation depths \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.32, n.3, p.467-478, maio/jun. 2012 \n\n469 \n\nGiven the above, the hypothesis of this study is that the soil water matric potential measured \n\nby puncture digital tensiometer shows no difference compared to values obtained by mercury \n\ntensiometer and soil moisture determined by tensiometry and soil water retention curve does not \n\ndiffer from that obtained by the technique of neutron moderation. \n\nThe objective was to evaluate the efficiency of digital tensiometer in relation to an analog \n\nmercury tensiometer, in obtaining the matric potential, and compare the values of soil moisture \n\nobtained from tensiometry with the technique of neutron moderation. \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nThe experiment was conducted in an experimental area of Faculty of Agriculture and \n\nVeterinary Sciences (FCAV), UNESP, Jaboticabal, State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (21\u00b014\u201951\u201d S and \n\n48\u00b016\u201958\u201d W). The experimental area was classified as an Oxisol (EMBRAPA, 2006), whose \n\nphysical attributes are presented in Table 1. \n\nFor determination of granulometric fractions of soil samples, it was used the pipette method \n\n(GEE &amp; BAUDER, 1986). For analysis of soil bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity and \n\nmicroporosity of the soil, it was used the method proposed by EMBRAPA (1997). \n\nTo conduct this study, it was selected four plots (P1, P2, P3 and P4) of a larger experiment \n\nwhich aimed to evaluate different methods to determine the height of the irrigation depths for \n\nirrigation of common bean. The culture was established in June 2008, conventional tillage in the \n\nconventional manner (chiseling and disking). The bean cultivar Carioca was used, spaced 0.45 m \n\nbetween rows.   \n\n \n\nTABLE 1.

The borders of \n\nthe plots corresponded to the initial and final 9 m length and 4 m from the sides, leaving the floor \n\narea of each plot with 288 m\u00b2 (36 m x 8 m). \n\nIn the plots P1 and P2, the irrigation depths were determined by estimating the maximum \n\nevapotranspiration of the bean and tensiometry. The methodology adopted for the onset, frequency \n\nand volume of irrigation depths applied to the plots is described in FERNANDES (2008). \n\nThe plots P3 and P4 were subjected to four and two irrigations, as shown in Table 2, in order \n\nto obtain variation in soil water content in relation to other plots. \n\nThe amounts of water, applied to each portion (irrigation depth) by a conventional irrigation \n\nsystem, were measured using a set of twelve manometers and their mean values, as well as \n\nprecipitation occurred during the experiment (Table 2). \n\nTo evaluate the uniformity of water distribution, it was used the uniformity coefficient of \n\nCHRISTIANSEN (1942), whose mean value was 87.9%, therefore, within the minimum value \n\nadopted as reference for the system of irrigation, which is 80%. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nJos\u00e9 M.

The repetitions were far apart in the 9 m plot. \n\nThe capsules of the ceramic tensiometers were submitted to bubbling test, which was \n\nconsisted of subjecting the capsules to pressure increases, with the reference values of more than \n\n100 kPa. \n\nThe readings of matric potential began 20 days after crop emergence, held daily from 7:00h \n\nand 8:00h, for a period of 52 days. The values of soil water matric potential, measured in mm of Hg \n\nwith the mercury tensiometer, were processed and corrected to kPa by eq.(1): \n\n?m = (-12,6 h1 + h2 + h3 ) 0.0981          (1) \n\n \n\nIn which:  \n\n?m - soil water matric potential, kPa;  \n\nh1 - manometric height of the mercury column, cm;  \n\nh2 - height from the mercury surface in the recipient to the soil surface, cm; and  \n\nh3 - tensiometer installation depth considered from the soil surface to the porous capsule \n\ncenter, cm. The value 0.0981 represents the transformation factor from cm of water \n\ncolumn to kPa.  \n\n \n\nThe values of soil water matric potential measured with the puncture digital tensiometer were \n\nconverted to kPa and corrected by the eq.(2): \n\n?m Dig = [(1019L) + (h1 + h2 )] 0.0981         (2) \n\n\n\nMeasurement systems of soil water matric potential and evaluation of soil moisture under different irrigation depths \n\nEng.

For this, a tensiometer \n\nwas constructed to allow both reading systems, mercury manometer and puncture digital \n\ntensiometer, to work together in the same tensiometric tube. The matric potential values measured \n\nby both reading systems were equivalent, indicating reliability of the values obtained by the digital \n\ntensiometer (Figure 1).  \n\ny = - 0,025 + 0,99x\nR\u00b2 = 0,99\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n\nL\ne\n\nit\nu\n\nra\n T\n\ne\nn\n\ns\n\u00edm\n\ne\ntr\n\no\n d\n\ne\n p\n\nu\nn\n\n\u00e7\n\u00e3\n\no\n d\n\nig\nit\n\na\nl \n\n(k\nP\n\na\n)\n\nLeitura de merc\u00fario (kPa)  \n\nFIGURE 1. Calibration of digital tensiometer reading system. \n\n \n\nAs the tensiometer does not provide direct reading of soil moisture, it was determined \n\nindirectly from the characteristic curve of soil water retention. For this, it was collected undisturbed \n\nsoil samples from each experimental plot in a depth of 0-0.20 m in three replications. The samples \n\nwere subjected to the tensions progressively 0.001; 0.002; 0.003; 0.004; 0.005; 0.006; 0.007; 0.008; \n\n0.009 and 0.01 MPa, using a tension table, and to the tensions of 0.03; 0.06; 0.1; 0.3 and 1.5 MPa \n\nusing the Richards pressure chamber with the porous plate (KLUTE, 1986). \n\nThe water retention in tension of 1.5 MPa was determined in deformed samples of soil, \n\nfollowing the method proposed by EMBRAPA (1997). Subsequently, an adjustment was made of \n\ndata of the water content retained in the different tensions by the model of GENUCHTEN (1980). \n\nAdditionally, with the aim of measuring soil moisture by neutron moderation technique, an \n\naluminum access tube was installed with internal diameter of 0.048 m and length of 1.9 m in each \n\nexperimental plot. The access tube was installed on the same line where the tensiometer were \n\ninstalled and located between the second and third repetitions of tensiometers, i.e., 4.5 m away from \n\neach tensiometers repetition. The model of the neutron probe equipment used was 503 DR \n\nHydroprobe of CPN Corporation, \n241\n\nAm/Be source of neutrons and radioactive intensity of \n\n1.85 GBq. The time to obtain neutron counts was 32 seconds and was based on experimental results \n\nobtained by BERALDO et al. (2009). \n\nThe methodology for calibration of a neutron probe consisted primarily of counting neutrons \n\nin water, as standard, and then in the soil, to obtain the relative neutron count (RC), which is \n\ndefined as the ratio of soil neutron count and water neutron count. \n\nReading of Mercury (kPa) \n\nR\ne\na\nd\n\nin\ng\n\n o\nf \n\nP\nu\n\nn\nc\ntu\n\nry\n d\n\nig\nit\n\na\nl \n\nte\nn\n\nsi\no\n\nm\ne\nte\n\nr \n(k\n\nP\na\n) \n\n\n\nJos\u00e9 M.

Two access tubes were \n\ninstalled, one irrigated with frequency and the other kept free of irrigation, in order to obtain \n\nvariations in the soil water conditions. The RC measurements were obtained at a depth of 0-0.20 m, \n\nwith eighteen repetitions. After the determinations, deformed soil samples were taken using \n\nvolumetric rings to determine the gravimetric soil moisture in the laboratory. \n\nFrom the values of RC and gravimetric soil moisture (average of 18 data pairs), the linear \n\nregression equation was obtained, as shown by equation 3: \n\n? = - 0.068 + 0.7802 RC R\n2\n = 0.95         (3) \n\n \n\nIn which:  \n\n? - gravimetric soil moisture in the layer of 0-0.20 m, and  \n\nRC - relative neutron count.  \n\n \n\nIt was performed analysis of correlation and regression between the matric potential values \n\nobtained by the mercury tensiometer and the puncture digital tensiometer. Two statistical indices \n\nwere used to quantify the differences between changes in soil water matric potential obtained by the \n\ntwo reading systems, they being the correlation coefficient (r) and the concordance index (d), \n\nproposed by WILLMOTT et al. (1985). \n\nBecause the statistical indexes do not quantify the errors, the indicators of mean absolute error \n\n(MAE) were certain, the square root of mean square error (SRMSE) and efficiency (EF) as \n\nZACHARIAS et al. (1996). The matric potential values obtained from the mercury tensiometer \n\nwere considered as reference for comparison between the reading systems. \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nThe values of soil water matric potential obtained by the tensiometers ranged from -5 to -80 \n\nkPa (Figure 2). From values of matric potential lower than -80 kPa it was not possible to obtain \n\nreadings measured by tensiometry. This is due to the action of matric forces acting on the soil, \n\ncausing a gradient of potential energy which causes water to flow from within the capsule into the \n\nsoil, i.e., from a higher energy place to a place with lower energy. As a result of transfer of energy, \n\nthe air contained in the soil is able to pass through the porous capsule wall, causing breakage of the \n\nequilibrium column between the water contained inside the tensiometric tube and the soil water. \n\nThis was observed in plots P2, P3 and P4 in the period between July 21\nst\n and 29\n\nth\n, 2008, because, in \n\nthis period, values of soil water matric potential lower than or equal to -80 kPa were recorded, the \n\nlimit value of reading tensiometer (Figure 2). \n\nThe values of soil water matric potential in P1 remained the same, with greater frequency in \n\npotential greater than -40 kPa, i.e., more humid conditions, as was expected due to the higher \n\nfrequency of irrigation and greater irrigation depth applied in this plot. \n\nIt was observed similar values of water matric potential between the reading systems when \n\nthese were kept at up to -40 kPa (Figure 2). In periods in which occurred soil drying with \n\nsubsequent replacement of the water, the greatest differences were observed between the values of \n\nthe readings of tensiometers with different reading systems, as may be seen on July 25\nth\n\n, shortly \n\nafter irrigation (Figure 2) and in the evaluation period from June 25\nth\n\n to July 15\nth\n\n.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMeasurement systems of soil water matric potential and evaluation of soil moisture under different irrigation depths \n\nEng.

Soil water matric potential measured by the mercury tensiometer (Tens Hg) and \n\npuncture digital tensiometer (TensDig) in plots P1 (a) P2 (b), P3 (c) and P4 (d). \n\n \n\nASSIS J\u00daNIOR &amp; REICHARDT (1997) observed in field work that the response of the \n\nmercury tensiometer and the air chamber tensiometer was similar, but in a condition in which the \n\nvalues of soil water matric potential were greater than -40 kPa. \n\nIt was observed lower amplitude between the values obtained by the mercury tensiometer and \n\npuncture digital tensiometer when the matric potential was less than -40 kPa when compared with \n\nthe mean amplitude during periods where the value of matric potential was higher than -40 kPa \n\n(Table 3). \n\nIn periods in which the value of matric potential was lower than -40 kPa the mean amplitude \n\n(in modulus) ranged from 1.3 to 2.1 kPa, whereas when the value of matric potential was higher \n\nthan -40 kPa, the mean amplitude ranged from 8.0 to 12.9 kPa, so a great difference between \n\nreading systems for the matric potential, when one takes into account the ranges above and below \n\n-40 kPa. With progressive cycles of wetting and drying, the air volume inside the tensiometer \n\nchanges, which causes a failure of the device response (MARINHO et al., 2008). \n\nCOELHO &amp; TEIXEIRA (2004) found that errors in the values of matric potential, obtained \n\nby mercury tensiometer, as well as a tensiometer comprising an electronic circuit and a differential \n\npressure sensor, tend to be more evident as the matric potential decreases, i.e., when the soil dries. \n\nUnder conditions of wetting and drying of the soil, the utilization of a capacitive sensor which \n\nhas extreme values of dielectric constant in different environments (air and water) showed low \n\nresponse time to variations in soil water content (CRUZ et al. 2010), thus constituting an alternative \n\nto estimating the soil water content under conditions of wetting and drying soil. \n\n \n\n \n\nM\na\ntr\n\nic\n p\n\no\nte\n\nn\nti\n\na\nl \n\n(k\nP\n\na\n) \n\nP\nre\n\nc\nip\n\nit\na\nti\n\no\nn\n +\n\n i\nrr\n\nig\na\nti\n\no\nn\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n) \n\nM\na\ntr\n\nic\n p\n\no\nte\n\nn\nti\n\na\nl \n\n(k\nP\n\na\n) \n\nP\nre\n\nc\nip\n\nit\na\nti\n\no\nn\n +\n\n i\nrr\n\nig\na\nti\n\no\nn\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n) \n\nM\na\ntr\n\nic\n p\n\no\nte\n\nn\nti\n\na\nl \n\n(k\nP\n\na\n) \n\nP\nre\n\nc\nip\n\nit\na\nti\n\no\nn\n +\n\n i\nrr\n\nig\na\nti\n\no\nn\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n) \n\nM\na\ntr\n\nic\n p\n\no\nte\n\nn\nti\n\na\nl \n\n(k\nP\n\na\n) \n\nDates \n\nDates \n\nDates \n\nDates \n\nIrrigation (mm) Precipitation (mm) \n\nP\nre\n\nc\nip\n\nit\na\nti\n\no\nn\n +\n\n i\nrr\n\nig\na\nti\n\no\nn\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n) \n\n\n\nJos\u00e9 M.

Similar results were observed by MORAES et al. (2006) and \n\nBRITO et al. (2009). This result may be attributed to a slight increase in potential, in the moment \n\nthe silicone rubber is pierced by the needle of the tensiometer, because, with the insertion of the \n\nneedle, the volume of air inside the tensiometric tube is changed. \n\nThe lowest and highest coefficient of determination (R\n2\n) between the values of soil water \n\nmatric potential measured by the two reading systems have been observed in the plots P1 and P4, \n\nrespectively. This fact shows that the potential values observed are similar when the soil is more \n\nhumid and they are most disparate in drier soil conditions (Figure 3). \n\nThese results corroborate the results found by MARTHALER et al. (1983), who obtained a \n\nhigh coefficient of determination (R\n2\n = 0.99) between the readings of soil matric potential measured \n\nwith a mercury tensiometer and digital pressure transducer. The authors attributed the results to \n\nhigher frequency of irrigation that kept the soil moist. \n\nAlso in Figure 3, it can be observed that the greatest data scattering in relation to the line 1:1 \n\noccurred for values of matric potential lower than -40 kPa, confirming that this was the value from \n\nwhich occurred the greatest differences between the values of soil matric potential measured by the \n\ntwo systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMeasurement systems of soil water matric potential and evaluation of soil moisture under different irrigation depths \n\nEng.

Regression and correlation analysis between the soil water matric potential (module) by \n\nmercury tensiometer and puncture digital tensiometer in plots P1 (a) P2 (b), P3 (c) and \n\nP4 (d). \n\n \n\nThe observed values of the concordance indexes and linear correlation used (d, r, EF, MAE \n\nand SRMSE) were high, indicating that the results obtained with puncture digital tensiometer \n\ncorrespond to the values obtained with the mercury tensiometer (Table 4). However, the highest \n\nvalues were observed in the plot P1 and the lowest in the plot P4, which suggests that, with the \n\nwetting of the soil, the value of matric potential obtained from the two reading systems tend to have \n\nmore similar results. A perfect match occurs when d, r and EF are equal to 1.00 and MAE and \n\nSRMSE are equal to zero. \n\nConsidering the evaluation period and the values of soil moisture obtained by tensiometry and \n\nby the technique of neutron moderation, it appears that both methods respond similarly to changes \n\n(increase or decrease) in their values. However, soil moisture measured by the two systems of \n\ntensiometry showed more similar values between each other and, in most cases, higher when \n\ncompared to those obtained with the technique of neutron moderation (Figure 4). The radius of \n\ninfluence of the neutron probe is higher when compared to that of the porous capsule of the \n\ntensiometer, providing measures in a larger volume of soil. \n\nThe major difference between moisture values obtained by the tensiometry and by the \n\ntechnique of neutron moderation was observed in P4 (Figure 4).

Near the operation limit of the \n\ntensiometer, the differences between the readings of the tensiometer and the probe are greater than \n\nthe differences when the soil was humid. \n\nIt is observed that the values of soil moisture obtained by the technique of neutron moderation \n\ndecreased from August 15\nth\n\n at P4, whereas the values did not vary by tensiometry.

However, the puncture digital tensiometer stood out in relation to mercury tensiometer \n\nbecause it presents simpler operation and maintenance, provides reading less influenced by the \n\noperator and do not use toxic product. \n\n \n\nTABLE 4.

Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.32, n.3, p.467-478, maio/jun. 2012 \n\n477 \n\nThe results of this study indicate that the puncture digital tensiometer may be used to monitor \n\nthe soil water matric potential under field conditions, with similar results to those obtained with the \n\nmercury tensiometer. However, it is recommended periodic maintenance of the silicone rubber to \n\nprevent air entering the system. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nThe soil water matric potential measured with the puncture digital tensiometer showed no \n\ndifference compared to values obtained by mercury tensiometer for potential greater than -40 kPa. \n\nWith cycles of soil wetting and drying, the matric potential obtained by puncture digital \n\ntensiometer was lower than the values obtained by mercury tensiometer. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n\nTo the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for the \n\nscholarship granted. \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nALBUQUERQUE, P.E.P.; DUR\u00c3ES, F.O.M.
