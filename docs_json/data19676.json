Our main goal was to carry out a comprehensive \nstudy of the bioactive glass sintering, identifying the powder size and sintering \nvariables effect, for future design of sintered glass scaffolds with competent \nmicrostructures.  \n\nThe developed scaffolds prepared by the salt sintering method using a \n3CaO.P2O5 - SiO2 - MgO glass system, with additions of Na2O with a salt, NaCl, \nexhibit high porosity, interconnectivity, pore size distribution and mechanical \nstrength suitable for bone repair applications.  \n\nThe replacement of 6 % MgO by Na2O in the glass network allowed to tailor the \ndissolution rate and bioactivity of the glass scaffolds. Regarding the biological \nassessment, the incorporation of sodium to the composition resulted in an \ninibition cell response for small periods. Nevertheless it was demonstrated that \nfor 21 days the cells response recovered and are similar for both glass \ncompositions. The in vitro behaviour of the glass scaffolds was tested by \nintroducing scaffolds to simulated body fluid for 21 days. Energy-dispersive X-\nray spectroscopy and SEM analyses proved the existence of CaP crystals for \nboth compositions. \n\nCrystallization forming whitlockite was observed to affect the dissolution \nbehaviour in simulated body fluid. By performing different heat treatments, it was \npossible to control the bioactivity and biocompatability of the glass scaffolds by \nmeans of a controlled crystallization. \n\nTo recover and tune the bioactivity of the glass-ceramic with 82 % crystalline \nphase, different methods have been applied including functionalization using 3-\naminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES). The glass ceramic modified surface \nexhibited an accelerated crystalline hydroxyapatite layer formation upon \nimmersion in SBF after 21 days while the as prepared glass-ceramic had no \ndetected formation of calcium phosphate up to 5 months.  \n\nA sufficient mechanical support for bone tissue regeneration that biodegrade \nlater at a tailorable rate was achievable with the glass\u2013ceramic scaffold. \nConsidering the biological assessment, scaffolds demonstrated an inductive \neffect on the proliferation of cells. The cells showed a normal morphology and \nhigh growth rate when compared to standard culture plates. \n\nThis study opens up new possibilities for using 3CaO.P2O5\u2013SiO2\u2013MgO glass to \nmanufacture various structures, while tailoring their bioactivity by controlling the \ncontent of the crystalline phase. Additionally, the in vitro behaviour of these \nstructures suggests the high potential of these materials to be used in the field \nof tissue regeneration. \n\n \n\n\n\nTable of Contents \n\nix \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n\n Acknowledgments ............................................................................................................................. iii \n\nResumo  ................................................................................................................................................ v \n\nAbstract .............................................................................................................................................vii \n\nTable of Contents ............................................................................................................................... ix \n\nList of Abbreviations ....................................................................................................................... xvii \n\nList of Symbols ................................................................................................................................. xix \n\nList of Figures .................................................................................................................................. xxi \n\nList of Tables ................................................................................................................................. xxvii \n\n \n\nChapter I \n\nPreface  ................................................................................................................................................1 \n\nI.1.

Preface \n\n1 \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER I \n\nPREFACE \n\nI.1.  Introduction \n\nAdvances in medicine have provided the man not only an increase in life expectancy, as well as \n\nthe desire for a better quality of life. This has generated an increase in demand and consequently \n\nthe development of new materials for use in grafts to restore function, remodel or even enhance \n\nbone structures.  \n\nThe restrictions related with the used of biological graft has led to the development of a newly \n\nemerging field of biomaterials called \u2018tissue engineering\u2019. One approach is to use three-\n\ndimensional, porous, degradable scaffolds, which provide support while allowing the ingrowth of \n\nnew bony tissue as the scaffold degrades. \n\nThe developed biomaterials for bone regeneration are intended to interact with the tissue in a \n\nspecific way, through the cellular and molecular stimuli, combining bioabsorption and bioactivity \n\nproperties in the same material. The use of bioactive glasses has proved advantageous because it \n\nrapidly bonds to bone and degrades over time, releasing soluble products that are thought to \n\nstimulate osteoprogenitor cells. There are several methods which can be utilized to obtain porous \n\nscaffolds, and one of the simplest is the particulate leaching technique after the salt sintering \n\nmethod. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nI. Preface \n\n2 \n\n \n\nI.1.1. Research Objectives \n\nThe central focus of this thesis is to develop porous glass and glass-ceramic scaffolds using the \n\nsalt sintering method.  \n\nTo achieve these goals, the following issues were addressed: \n\n? Development and optimization of the sintering processes tailoring specific scaffold \n\nparameters affecting microstructural architecture, namely pore size, pore network \n\ngeometry, hierarchical microstructures, and anisotropy of internal pore structures. \n\n \n\n? Changement of the base glass composition in the CaO?P2O5?SiO2 system by suitable \n\nadditives (such as Na2O as modifier and MgO as stabilizer), aiming to obtain glass melts \n\nof controlled viscosity and workability to enlarge the \u201cworking window\u201d for sintering. \n\n \n\n? Evaluation of the characteristics of surface reactivity and mechanical resistance of \n\nselected compositions.  \n\n \n\n? Understanding of the effect of crystallization and functionalization on the surface \n\nreactivity in acellular medium and in cell cultures to allow assessing the best compromise \n\nin the fabricated scaffolds. \n\n \n\nI.1.2. Structure of the thesis \n\nThis dissertation is structured in eleven chapters. Chapter I provides a succinct introduction, the \n\nresearch objectives and an outlook of the content of each chapter. Chapter II presents an extensive \n\nliterature review that range from bone structure, to bioactive glasses, sintering and crystallization \n\nprocedures and functionalization. Chapter III outlines the research methods used in testing the \n\ngoals presented in Chapter I. \n\nThe outcome of the experimental work is divided in the next seven chapters and correspond to \n\nthe manuscripts resulted from the research activity that had been published or submitted to ISI \n\njournals. Finally, Chapter XI present the overall conclusions of the dissertation and describes \n\npotential future directions. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Chapter II \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\"The process of scientific discovery is, in effect, a continual flight from wonder.\" \n\nAlbert Einstein (1879 \u2013 1955) \n\n\n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n5 \n\n \n\n  \n\nCHAPTER II \n\nLITERATURE REVIEW \n\nII.1. Bone Repair \n\nII.1.1. Bone tissue \n\nBone tissue is a specialized connective tissue, which composition, organization and dynamics \n\nallow to participate in the mechanical functions of support, protection and mobility and mineral \n\nhomeostasis in the body. According to the macroscopic structure, the bone may be divided into \n\ntwo categories, trabecular bone, also known as cancellous or spongy bone and cortical (or \n\ncompact) bone. The major difference between these two types of bone is on the basis of porosity \n\nand the unit microstructure [1]. Cortical bone tissue is denser with low porosity (10 %) and \n\nsurrounds the marrow space, whereas trabecular bone is composed of a honeycomb-like network \n\nof trabecular plates and rods interspersed in the bone marrow compartment, with an \n\ninterconnected porosity between 50 and 90 %.  Both cortical and trabecular bone are composed \n\nof osteons, Fig. II.1. The osteon consists of a central canal called the osteonic (haversian) canal, \n\nwhich is surrounded by concentric rings (lamellae) of matrix. The osteonic canals contain blood \n\nvessels that are parallel to the long axis of the bone. These blood vessels interconnect, by way of \n\nperforating canals, with vessels on the surface of the bone [2]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.II.1. The structure of bone [3] \n\nThe bone mechanical loading functions and protection are achieved by both, the bone mineral \n\nphase which confers strength and stiffness while the organic phase, collagen, is responsible for \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n6 \n\n \n\nbone toughness and ductility. The cancellous bone works mainly in compression while cortical \n\nbone must withstand compressive forces, tensile and shear. The mineral component of bone are \n\ncalcium phosphates, being the most important constituent, hydroxyapatite, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. The \n\nassociation of the hydroxyapatite crystals with a size between 10-100 nm, with the collagen fibres \n\nis responsible for the hardness and strength characteristics of the bone tissue. The bone apatite \n\nstructure also contains small amounts of fluorine, chlorine, sodium and magnesium [4].  \n\nII.1.2. Bone cells \n\nThe bone cells are responsible for producing, maintaining and modifying the structure of bone \n\ntissue. Distributed as a layer over the bone matrix are the osteoblasts, lining cells and osteoclast \n\nwhereas osteocytes permeate the mineralised interior of the bone, as shown in Fig.II.2.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.II.2. Schematic diagram of bone structure at cellular level [5] \n\nII.1.2.1. Osteoblasts  \n\nThe osteoblasts are considered responsible for the synthesis and mineralization of bone during \n\nboth initial bone formation and later bone remodelling. [6]. They produce many cell products, \n\nincluding the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and collagen, part of the organic unmineralized \n\ncomponent of the bone called osteoid. Eventually the osteoblast is surrounded by the growing \n\nbone matrix, and, as the material calcifies, the cell is trapped in a space called lacuna. Thus \n\nentrapped, it becomes an osteocyte.  \n\nII.1.2.2. Osteocytes \n\nThe osteocyte is the most common cell. As mentioned before, they derive from osteoblasts which \n\nbecome enclosed within the bone matrix during bone formation. Each osteocyte communicates \n\nwith its neighbours by means of gap junctions, through small channels in the bone matrix called \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n7 \n\n \n\ncanaculi. Osteocytes are therefore in close communication with osteocytes and osteoblasts, \n\nsupplying nutrients [7,8] \n\nII.1.2.3. Osteoclasts  \n\nOsteoclasts are multinucleated cells as they are formed from two or more cells that fuse together, \n\nwhich can resorb bone. They come from the bone marrow and are related to white blood cells. \n\nThey are found on the surface of the bone mineral next to the dissolving bone [9]. \n\nII.2. Bone tissue regeneration \n\nThe bone has the ability to promote its spontaneous regeneration and remodel its micro and \n\nmacrostructure, through processes of osteogenesis (bone formation) and bone resorption [10]. \n\nHowever, when bone regeneration is required in large quantity, such as for skeletal reconstruction \n\nof large bone defects created by fracture or diseases, alternatives to complement the \u2018insufficient\u2019 \n\nbone-regeneration process are on demand. Autologous bone (bone removed from the patient) are \n\nstill being considered as the \u201cgold standard\u201d bone-grafting material [11]. Since this kind of grafts \n\nis osteoconductive (provides a scaffold on which bone cells can proliferate), osteoinductive \n\n(induces proliferation of undifferentiated cells and their differentiation into osteoblasts), and \n\nosteogenic (provides a reservoir of skeletal stem and progenitor cells that can form new bone). \n\nAllografts obtained from human cadavers or living donors, is an alternative allogeneic bone \n\ngrafting, which bypasses the problems associated with harvesting and quantity of graft material \n\npresent in autologous bone [12]. Although bone repairs are still mostly performed by grafting, \n\nthere are issues of immunogenicity and rejection reactions, possibility of infection transmission, \n\nand cost [13]. Due to the numerous constraints that such grafts exhibit bone graft substitutes were \n\ndeveloped. Scaffolds made of synthetic or natural biomaterials, where developed to promote the \n\nmigration, proliferation and differentiation of bone cells for bone regeneration [14\u201319]. While \n\nvarious biomaterials have been introduced to respond to this need, it is considered impossible to \n\ndevelop a biomaterial to fulfil the requirements to all desired applications [20\u201322]. \n\nOne of the great challenges that biomaterials science faces today stems from the increasingly need \n\nof implants use, coupled with the significant increase in Human life expectancy. In fact, an \n\nincreasing fraction of patients live beyond the expected life of your implants, so that new materials \n\nshould present a durability of around 20 to 30 years, twice that found in materials used until the \n\npresent. \n\nThe target of tissue engineering is to restore structure and function to a defect and not only for \n\nreplacement thereof [23], using the body\u2019s natural healing response in addition to treatment with \n\none or more of three elements: cells, signalling molecules and scaffolds [24]. There are two \n\ngeneral strategies in the field of tissue engineering: the first focuses on in vitro seeding and \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n8 \n\n \n\nculturing specific cell types in a scaffold. The cells grow outside the body, become differentiated, \n\nand mimic naturally occurring tissues. These tissue-engineered constructs are then implanted into \n\npatients to replace diseased or damaged tissues. With time the scaffolds are resorbed and replaced \n\nby host tissues. The second strategy involves using the scaffold as a growth factor/drug delivery \n\ndevice using the body\u2019s own systems, where regeneration of tissues is induced in vivo. After \n\nimplantation cells from the body are recruited to the scaffold site and form tissue upon and \n\nthroughout the matrices. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive and can be easily \n\ncombined [25].  \n\nII.3. Scaffolds \u2013 Requirements \n\nScaffolds are three dimensional (3D) structures that should exhibit tailored porosity, pore size and \n\ninterconnectivity, providing an environment and architecture specific to favour tissue integration \n\nand vascularisation [26]. The material composition and structural characteristics such as the \n\ninternal and external architecture are of crucial importance for the success of the tissue \n\nengineering strategies [27,28]. Ideally, scaffolds should favour cell attach, growth and \n\ndifferentiation [29]. The scaffolds must be constructed in order to allow the mimic of the \n\nregeneration process and should have an external shape adapted to the size and geometry of the \n\ndefect [25]. After implantation, the scaffold should allow neovascularization, stimulate bone \n\ntissue formation and must be biodegradable or resorbable to allow for replacement of newly \n\nformed tissue [2]. It is desirable that in addition to the features previously mentioned, the matrix \n\nmechanical behaviour presents compatibility with the bone [4]. These properties should be \n\nmaintained as matrix degrades and new tissue growth occurs [30]. Finally, the synthetized \n\nmaterial and fabricated scaffold should be suitable for sterilization and the production technology \n\nmust be scalable and cost-effective. These requirements will further be developed in the next \n\npoints. \n\nII.3.1. Porosity \n\nIdeally scaffolds should have a high interconnected porosity to allow tissue and cell ingrowth and \n\nalso vascularization of tissue, significant diffusion of nutrients and metabolic waste resulting from \n\nthe activity of cells which will grow, meantime, in the scaffold [28, 31\u201333]. However, the degree \n\nof porosity also influences other properties, such as mechanical stability, and should therefore be \n\nbalanced with the needs of mechanical deployment location, for use in vivo. The pore size is also \n\nof great importance, especially the implementation of the bimodal porosity for the effective \n\nscaffold vascularization and for bone ingrowth [34]. If the pores have a reduced size, pore \n\nocclusion occurs with the anchor of cells, which in turn will prevent cell penetration, production \n\nof extracellular matrix and neovascularization of the internal area of the scaffold.  \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n9 \n\n \n\nTo discuss the pore morphologies of the scaffolds it is necessary to stablish the size classification \n\nof pores. The International Union of Pure Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) classification of pore size \n\nfor Catalysis application is micropores &lt;2 nm, mesopores 2-50 nm and macropores > 50 nm [35]. \n\nThe follower pore size classification [33,36,37], is commonly used for scaffolds to be employed \n\nin bone regeneration, 1\u201320 ?m as micropores and macropores > 100 ?m, even though the scale \n\nrange of these dimensions are higher than those of IUPAC. \n\nRegarding the ideal size of pores, most authors consider advisable a diameter larger than 100-150 \n\n?m to allow host cell components and extra-cellular bone tissue and blood vessels. Ensuring the \n\nsupply of blood and providing a more effective and healthy growth of bone tissue (osteogenesis \n\nwithout preceding cartilage formation) [33,38\u201340],  and micropores (? 2\u201310 ?m) for cell \n\nadhesion, migration and osteointegration [41]. However, other authors [42] believe that bone \n\nreconstruction is obtained only through a 3D matrix with temporary interconnected macropores \n\nin the range of 1.2\u20132.0 mm. The latter approach reduces the mechanical resistance limiting the in \n\nvivo applications of these matrices [43].  \n\nII.3.2. Surface \n\nThe superficial properties of the materials namely chemical and topographical determine the ionic \n\nexchange dynamics and the protein adsorption. They also can control and provoke cellular \n\nadhesion, proliferation and differentiation [44\u201346]. A bioactive material induces the formation of \n\na carbonate apatite layer biologically active on its surface, creating a compatible environment \n\nwith osteogenesis. This mineralized interface assures the linking between the material and the \n\nbone tissue, resulting in the tissue regeneration [44]. Roughness mainly improves mechanical cell \n\nattachment, although the correlation of this event \u2013 increasing roughness \u2013 with cell attachment \n\nremains unknown [47\u201350]. Increasing the specific surface area and pore volume of bioactive glass \n\nmay greatly accelerate the apatite formation and therefore enhance the bioactive behaviour [51]. \n\nII.3.3. Mechanical Properties and Biodegradability \n\nStrength is another important property of scaffolds considered for the replacement of load-bearing \n\nbone. The mechanical properties of the scaffold is strongly influenced by internal architecture \n\n[39,52\u201354] and must be carefully designed [55,56] to be suitable for bone regeneration. Ideally, \n\nit should be equivalent to bone in terms of the characteristics shown in Table II.1.  \n\nTable II.1.  Mechanical properties of bone under compression [57].  \n\n ?

The intrinsic brittleness \n\nand low fracture toughness limits the use of some materials in load-bearing implants. The \n\nmechanical properties should allow scaffolds to resist the pressure and maintain the porosity \n\nneeded for cell growth and matrix production [4,21,52].  \n\nAt the same time, scaffolds should not only have similar mechanical properties to that of the host \n\ntissue, but also be able to degrade with time in vivo, preferably at a controllable biodegradation/ \n\nbioresorption rate (chemical dissolution or decomposition of biomaterials under physiological \n\nenvironments), without the need for surgical removal. The rate of degradation should vary based \n\non its application and can be affected by several factors. Generally, it depends upon the chemical \n\ncomposition of the scaffold, the solubility of degraded products and the local pH of the \n\nsurrounding environment. It also depends on the scaffolds crystallinity and physical arrangements \n\nlike porosity pore size and distribution.  \n\nThe maintenance of the strength and stability of the interface during the breakdown and \n\nreconstruction of natural host tissue and the matching of the degradation rate of the support with \n\nthe growth rate of new bone tissue are some of the difficulties in the development of scaffolds \n\nmaterials [53,58,59]. \n\nII.3.4. Biocompatibility \n\nOne of the primary requirements of any bone scaffolds is biocompatibility a term that has been \n\ndescribed in many ways. Biocompatibility of a scaffold is described in the William dictionary of \n\nbiomaterials [60] as its ability to perform its desired function, that is, to support normal cellular \n\nactivity with an appropriate response in a specific application.  \n\nAn ideal bone scaffold must be osteoconductive where the scaffold allows the bone cells to adhere, \n\nproliferate, and form extracellular matrix on its surface and pores. The scaffold should also be \n\nable to induce new bone formation through biomolecular signalling and recruiting progenitor cells, \n\na property known as osteoinduction [61,62].  \n\nII.4. Bioactive Glasses \n\nSeveral materials have been used with the aim of producing scaffolds mostly polymers of natural \n\nor synthetic origin and some ceramics/glasses [37,63\u201365]. Of all materials used in the \n\nmanufacture of scaffolds, we will focus on glasses, the object of study of this thesis.  \n\nThe first glass to be approved for biomedical use, in 1985, was developed by Hench for use in \n\nmiddle ear surgery and is commercially available as Bioglass\u00ae, also designated as 45S5. The \n\nname \u201845S5\u2019 refers to both the SiO2 content (45 wt. %) and the Ca/P molar ratio. Developed in \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n11 \n\n \n\n1969 it was produced like conventional glass in which the basic components are SiO2, Na2O, CaO \n\nand P2O5. The bioactivity of these materials refers to the special response that they induce upon \n\ncontact with the physiological environment.  \n\nBioactive glasses develop on its surface a biologically active hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) \n\nlayer which provides a bonding interface with the tissue, chemically and structurally equivalent \n\nto the mineral phase in bone [64,66\u201368].  \n\nAccording to Hench [69,70], the process of apatite formation on silica-based bioactive glasses \n\nsurfaces is divided into five stages, Fig. II.3: \n\n \n\n- Rapid exchange of Na+ and/or K+ from glasses with H+ or H3O\n+ from solution, leading to \n\na high pH local environment (stage I) \n\nSi\u2013O\u2013Na+ + H+ ? Si\u2013OH + Na+ (Eq. II.1) \n\n- Loss of soluble silica in the form of Si(OH)4 and Si\u2013OH, due to breaking of Si\u2013O\u2013Si \n\nbonds by the attack of H+ (stage II) \n\nSi\u2013O\u2013Si + H2O ? Si\u2013OH + OH\u2013Si (Eq. II.2) \n\n- Condensation and repolymerization of silanols Si(OH)4 to form a SiO2-rich layer depleted \n\nin alkali and alkaline-earth cations (stage III) \n\n- Precipitation of Ca2+ and PO4\n3- ions on the silica-rich layer to form an amorphous calcium \n\nphosphate-rich layer (stage IV) \n\n- Crystallization of the amorphous film by incorporation of OH- and CO3\n2- anions (stage V) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \nFig.II.3.  Schematic representation of the process of apatite formation on bioactive \n\nsurfaces in contact with SBF [71] \n\nThe presence of this HCA layer is considered to be useful but not critical for bone mineralization \n\n[72,73]. Bioactive glasses [68,74,75] typically contain less than 60 wt. % of SiO2 and large \n\namounts of alkali and alkaline-earth oxides. The alkali and alkaline-earth ions are exchanged with \n\nH+ (or H3O\n+) ions from the solution, leading to the hydrolysis of the silica groups and the creation \n\nof silanol (Si?OH) groups on the glass surface. The increase in pH (or OH? concentration) leads \n\nto attack of the SiO2 glass network, and the dissolution of silica, in the form of silicic acid, Si(OH)4, \n\ninto the solution, and the continued formation of Si?OH groups on the glass surface, which \n\ndecreases the leaching of ions. At this stage, Ca2+ and PO4 groups migrate from the fluid to \n\nthe silica-rich layer, and finally a CaP-rich layer is deposited on top of the glass which crystallizes \n\nto hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) [2].  \n\nThe 45S5 composition consists of a silicate network (45 wt. % SiO2) incorporating 24.5%Na2O, \n\n24.5%CaO and 6 % P2O5 (wt. %). The high amounts of Na2O and CaO, as well as the relatively \n\nhigh CaO/P2O5 ratio make the glass surface highly reactive in physiological environments. Over \n\nthe years other compositions were developed with additional elements incorporated in the silicate \n\nnetwork, (table II.1) such as fluorine [76], magnesium [77,78], strontium [79\u201381], iron [82], silver \n\n[83\u201386], boron [87\u201391], potassium [92] or zinc [18,93,94]. The development of new biomaterials \n\nhas recently concentrated on SiO2-free glasses [91,95\u201398].  \n\nThe first materials incorporating magnesium oxide were Ceravital glasses (40?50 SiO2, 10?15 \n\nP2O5, 5?10 Na2O, 0.5?3.0 K2O and 2.5?5 MgO (wt. %)) and the resulting glass-ceramic materials. \n\nKokubo et al. [43] worked with glasses of SiO2\u2013CaO\u2013P2O5-MgO. Vogel and Holand [99] \n\ndeveloped the Bioverit family of glass ceramic in which MgO content is in the range 6 ? 28 mol. %. \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n13 \n\n \n\nRegarding to MgO, its contribution to the bioactivity is controversial [100]. MgO has been \n\ndocumented to decrease apatite formation in SBF [101] but also, on the other hand, to improve \n\nthe early stages of mineralization [102] and contribute to an intimate contact with living tissue, \n\nshowing that it is possible to design glasses with high MgO content (~ 18 %) without loss of \n\nbioactivity [103].  \n\nThe development of phosphate glasses for biomedical application in the early 80's, introduced by \n\nGilchrist [104], allowed an adjustment of the chemical composition to the mineral phase of bone, \n\nand a wide range of degradation rates as a function of this composition, adaptable to the required \n\napplication [58,59].  \n\nRecent studies have shown that the ionic products, resulting from glass dissolution, enhance \n\nosteogenesis by regulating osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression \n\n[7,25,68,80,105,106]. In vitro testing of biomaterials is used to provide rapid data on the \n\nbiological interaction of materials with cells. This in vitro and also the in vivo tests showed that \n\nthere is a sequence of bioactive glass reaction with tissues [2,107], and 6 more stages were added \n\nto the 5 presented before: \n\n \n\n- Adsorption of biological moieties in the SiO2-hydroxycabonate apatite layer from \n\nsurrounding tissues (stage VI) \n\n- Action of macrophages to remove debris from the site allowing cells to occupy the space \n\n(stage VII) \n\n- Attachment of stem cells on the bioactive glass surface (stage VIII) \n\n- Differentiation of stem cells to form bone growing cells, such as osteoblasts (stage IX) \n\n- Generation of extra cellular matrix (stage X) \n\n- Mineralization of matrix through crystallisation of inorganic calcium phosphate matrix to \n\nenclose bone cells in living structure (stage XI) \n\nII.5. Bioactive Glasses Applications \n\nThe first clinical applications of a bioactive glass were solid plates [43] for replacing the bones \n\nof the middle ear, 1985, but most current applications are based on particulates [64,74]. The first \n\nparticulate material cleared for sale was PerioGlas\u00ae, in 1993 in USA and in Europe in 1995. Their \n\ninitial clinical applications were to restore bone loss resulting from periodontal disease [64,108] \n\nand in middle ear surgery [109]. Bioglass\u00ae particulate is also used for the treatment of dentinal \n\nhypersensitivity, incorporated into toothpaste, or used with an aqueous vehicle and applied to the \n\ntooth surface around exposed root dentin [110]. Building on the successes of PerioGlas\u00ae, a \n\nBioglass\u00ae particulate for orthopaedic bone grafting, in non-load-bearing sites, was introduced in \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n14 \n\n \n\nclinical applications in the European market in 2000, under the trade name NovaBone\u00ae. In \n\northopaedic applications, the development and improvement of these glasses were directed \n\nmainly to the enhancement of the mechanical properties, through the preparation of glass-\n\nceramics (section II.8).  \n\nIn the form of scaffolds, the porosity allows new bone tissue to grow into the porous structure, \n\nproviding an adequate biological fixation [111\u2013114]. The interest in bioactive glasses has been \n\nexpanded since their initial discovery and now it is also focused on tissue engineering applications.  \n\nAll compositions, in Table II.2, were or are being used in scaffold production. \n\nTable II.2.

The sintering \n\nprocess requires temperatures above the glass transition temperature of the glass, in order to \n\ninitiate the densification of the powder and, the Bioglass\u00ae crystallises immediately above its glass \n\ntransition. Even after crystallization, most of the compressive strength values are out of the range \n\nobtained for trabecular bone, as can be seen in Table II.1.   \n\nThe following section is a short review of the common scaffold fabrication methods presented on \n\nTable II, including the advantages and disadvantages of each. \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n17 \n\n \n\nII.6.1. Polymer foam replication   \n\nThe replication method involves the preparation of glass green bodies\u2019 foams by coating a \n\npolymer foam with a glass slurry. The polymer, having the desired pore structure, simply serves \n\nas a sacrificial template for the glass coating. The polymer template is immersed in the slurry and \n\nthe excess slurry squeezed out leaving a more or less homogeneous coating on the foam struts. \n\nAfter drying, the polymer is slowly burned out in order to minimise damage to the glass coating. \n\nOnce the polymer has been removed, the glass network is sintered to a desired density. Their \n\nmicrostructure depends on the initial morphology of the preformed foam. The foam replica \n\ntechnique has the ability to produce foams with a highly porous structure and adjustable pore \n\ndimensions. Moreover irregular shapes can be produced to match the size and shape of the bone \n\ndefect. \n\nBy using the described method, different types of scaffolds with tailored gradient of porosity were \n\nfabricated. Chen et al. [118] were able to prepare a porous 45S5 bioactive glass-ceramic scaffold \n\nwith 89 to 90 % porosity by using a polyurethane template. With the introduction of magnesium \n\nand potassium, a 13\u201393 glass-ceramic scaffold was prepared by the same method with similar \n\nporosity and a compressive strength of 11 \u00b1 1 MPa [131], which match the highest values reported \n\nfor human trabecular bone (Table I). These compressive strengths values are more than 10 times \n\nhigher than the reported for 45S5 Bioglass\u00ae based scaffolds [118] as a result of the glass \n\ncomposition that improves the viscous flow characteristics of 13\u201393 glass and the glass \n\ndensification prior to crystallization. \n\nII.6.2. Glass fibers \n\nSintering bioactive glass fibers is also an interesting method to achieve a scaffold with \n\ninterconnecting porosity. In this process, the scaffold is formed by thermally bonding a loose and \n\nrandom packing of fibers in a mold. The relative porosity, pore size and strength of these scaffolds \n\ncan be controlled by changing certain parameters such as the size of the fibers, temperature and \n\nsintering time [154,155]. Pirhonen et al. [155] used the glass system 53SiO2\u20136Na2O\u201312K2O\u2013\n\n5MgO\u201320CaO\u20134 P2O5 (wt. %) to obtain fibers with 100 mm in diameter and 3 mm length. \n\nThrough the glass fiber technique, scaffolds were obtained with 80 % porosity and pore average \n\nsize of 420 ?m, by sintering at 690 \u00b0C. Porosity in the form of interconnected pore space is \n\nprovided by the pore space between the glass fibers. With the increase of sintering temperature, \n\nthe densification of the structure increases, reducing the relative porosity and pore size with \n\nconsequent loss of pore interconnectivity.  \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n18 \n\n \n\nII.6.3.  Foam glass \n\nThe use of foaming agents to the sol-gel has been studied by several authors [123,128,156,157]. \n\nYuan, et al. have adopted H2O2 as a foaming agent to prepare and manufacture 45S5 bioactive \n\nglass scaffolds, with pore sizes ranging from 100\u2013600 ?m [157]. The H2O2 decomposition process \n\nleads to a random distribution of interconnected pores. An increment in the porosity, pore size \n\nand interconnectivity degree was observed by Navarro et al. [123] with the increase of H2O2 \n\ncontent. The hydrogen peroxide lead to the formation of pores with a particular morphology, \n\nelongated at lower concentrations and more spherical at higher concentrations. The scaffold with \n\nhigher porosity (55 %) obtained with the addition of 60 % H2O2 showed pore size greater than \n\n500 ?m.  \n\nThe produced scaffolds belongs to the porous SiO2 (100S), SiO2\u2013CaO (70S30C) and CaO\u2013P2O5 \n\n\u2013SiO2 (58S) systems, have a specific surface area between 106 to 283 m\n2 g-1 because of the \n\nnanopores in the glass that are inherent to the sol\u2013gel process, mechanical strength of 2.2 \u2013 2.4 \n\nMPa, similar to spongy bone and porous hydroxyapatite used clinically [128,156]. Consequently \n\nthey are suitable for substituting defects in low-load sites only. In the foam glass technique, as the \n\ntemperatures increase the glasses become substantially crystallized and their degradability will \n\ndecrease. It is also difficult to control the percentage and pore size, and the interconnectivity of \n\nthe prepared materials making it challenging to obtain geometries and porosity appropriated to \n\nthe desired application. \n\nII.6.4. Burning out method \n\nAs a porosity promoter, it is also possible to use organic particles such as sucrose [126], gelatin \n\n[158], naphthalene [159], polyethylene [135], corn, potatoes and rice starches [78,149]. The \n\norganic phase can be added to ceramic powders and subsequently it is thermally removed during \n\nsintering. PEG-glycol particles of different sizes and amounts were used to retrieve a porous \n\nbioactive glass after sintering [160]. The sintering occurs only at temperatures higher than the \n\nfiring temperature of the porogen. This approach presents low production costs, however \n\ncontrolling the composition of the finished products is difficult because of glass tendency to \n\ncrystallize during thermal treatment, resulting in problems of homogeneity and reproducibility. \n\nIn addition, it is difficult to achieve highly porous samples with adequate mechanical properties. \n\nA porosity value between 50 and 70 vol.% has been reported for glass-ceramic scaffolds based \n\non a SiO2\u2013CaO\u2013K2O system [126,135]. However, lower porosity values are often reported \n\n[78,149]. Macroporous glass-ceramics of the CaO\u2013P2O5\u2013Na2O\u2013TiO system were obtained by \n\npressing and sintering a mixture of glass particles with sucrose (particle diameter > 500 \u00b5m). Low \n\nsintering temperature, high sucrose glass ratio, and small glass particles size provide high porosity, \n\napproximately 80 to 90 %. However, the use of low sintering temperatures, impairs the \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n19 \n\n \n\nmechanical strength of the structure [126]. Another similar process consists in mixing particles \n\nof camphor (C10H16O) with Bioglass\n\u00ae 45S5 [146]. Macropores were obtained with a diameter \n\nbetween 200 \u2013 300 \u00b5m. However, this technique yielded only 21 % of the total porosity with \n\nisolated pores, not being thus possible to simulate the intertrabecular bone. Soundrapandian et al \n\n[159] have produced 63 \u2013 66 % porous bioactive glass scaffolds based on SiO2\u2013Na2O\u2013ZnO\u2013CaO\u2013\n\nMgO\u2013P2O5 system (BGZ and MBG) for drug delivery using naphthalene as a porogen. The \n\nnaphthalene was evaporated from the samples via very slow drying up to 80 \u00baC, followed by \n\nsintering at approximately 725 \u00baC. \n\nLi Nas et al. [125] prepared macroporous sol\u2013gel bioglasses using granular polyethylene glycol \n\n(PEG) as pore former with 60 \u2013 70 % porosity. The pore diameter was distributed around 10 \u2013 \n\n200 ?m containing mesopores of 2 \u2013 50 nm. The volume and size of pore former can control the \n\nporosity and the macropore diameter. \n\nII.6.5. Leaching particle/Salt sintering process \n\nThis is a simple way to make a porous scaffold using water-soluble particles such as salts NaCl, \n\nK2SO4 and MgSO4 that are dissolved leaving pores of the same size as the salt. The pore structures \n\ncan easily be manipulated by controlling the size and fraction of the porogen. Unless sufficient \n\nporogen is used it may be difficult to leach it from the glass, and at high percentages, the \n\nmechanical properties of the scaffold are substantially reduced. The most common porogen used \n\nis NaCl. Depending upon the glass / salt ratio, this technique allows to obtain values of porosity \n\nof about 75 % [151,152]. The scaffolds thus obtained have a very low mechanical strength of 0.29 \n\nMPa [151].  \n\nThe selected salt must have a suitable particle size, melting temperature higher than the \n\ntemperature of densification of the glass and a high solubility in a solvent in which the glass is \n\ninsoluble. The added salt should not induce the formation of new phases in the glass composition \n\nduring sintering. Regarding this technique, it can be established that the densification of the \n\nsintered material is greater, the smaller the size of the glass particles with respect to the salt.  \n\nThis technique has the advantage of being quite simple, but the results were still not satisfactory \n\nsince the control of processing variables and their effect on sintering characteristics of the \n\nsupports has not been investigated. Further studies are necessary and will be performed in this \n\nthesis. \n\nII.6.6.  Solid freeform fabrication \n\nSolid freeform fabrication (SFF), also referred to as rapid prototyping (RP), describes a group of \n\ntechniques used to manufacture 3D objects from a computer aided design (CAD) file, without the \n\nuse of traditional tools such as dies or molds. The technique can be used to predesign the scaffold \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n20 \n\n \n\narchitecture structure on a computer. Several SFF techniques have been used for scaffold \n\nfabrication, but there is little information on the production of glass scaffolds based on these \n\ntechniques. Recently, scaffolds of apatite\u2013mullite glass\u2013ceramics, 13\u201393, and 6P53B glasses have \n\nbeen manufactured using freeze extrusion, selective laser sintering and robocasting methods \n\n[124,153]. In the last method, an aqueous paste of 6P53B bioactive micron-sized glass powder is \n\nextruded through a fine nozzle, printing lines as thin as 30 ?m, and deposited over the previous \n\nlayer, obtaining a scaffold with a compressive strength of 136 MPa, comparable to human cortical \n\nbone [65].  \n\nII.6.7. Freeze casting of suspensions \n\nThe freeze casting route involves rapid freezing of a ceramic slurry, poured into a mould and \n\nsubsequent freeze drying to sublimate the solvent under vacuum, avoiding the drying stresses and \n\nshrinkage that may lead to cracks and warping during normal drying. After drying, the compacts \n\nare sintered in order to fabricate a porous material with improved strength, stiffness and desired \n\nporosity. The result scaffold has a complex and often anisotropic porous microstructure. By \n\ncontrolling the growth direction of the ice crystals, it is possible to impose a preferential \n\norientation for the porosity in the final material. A benefit of the oriented microstructure is higher \n\nscaffold strength in the direction of orientation, compared to the strength of a scaffold with a \n\nrandomly oriented microstructure. Unidirectional freezing of aqueous suspensions has been used \n\nrecently to produce oriented bioactive glass scaffolds. The process commonly results in the \n\nformation of porous constructs with a lamellar microstructure. However, the width of the slot-like \n\npores (10 \u2013 40 \u00b5m) is considered to be too small to support tissue ingrowth. Both 45S5 and 13\u2013\n\n93 glass scaffolds have been prepared using this technique [129,141]. Bioactive glass 13\u201393 was \n\nused in the fabrication of scaffolds with pore diameters of 100 \u2013 150 ?m and oriented columnar \n\nmicrostructures by unidirectional freezing of camphene-based suspensions. It has also been \n\nshown that the addition of an organic solvent such as 1, 4 - dioxane to the aqueous solvent, results \n\nin a change of the lamellar microstructure to a columnar microstructure with an increase in the \n\npore width.  \n\nII.7. Sintering \n\nIn all the methods used for the production of 3-D structures from glass particles it is necessary to \n\nresort to sintering. During the heat treatment the viscosity of glass dramatically decreased. \n\nBecause of surface tension effects, that vary as a function of surface curvature, material flows are \n\ndriven toward the particle necks, thus densifying a powder compact into a ceramic solid.  \n\nThe overall sintering process was roughly divided in three steps, fig. II.4, that have been analyzed \n\nby Frenkel (initial stage) [161,162], Scherer (intermediate stage) [163,164], and Mackenzie \u2013 \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n21 \n\n \n\nShuttleworth, MS model (final stage) [165,166]. These stages are defined according to the \n\nporosity and grains morphology. \n\nThe initial stage consists of fairly rapid interparticle neck growth by diffusion, vapour transport, \n\nplastic flow, or viscous flow. For a powder system with an initial density of 50 \u2013 60 % of the \n\ntheoretical density, this corresponds to a linear shrinkage of 3 to 5 % or to a relative density of \n\n65 %. In the intermediate stage pores form a network of channels between the interconnected \n\nparticles. This stage ends when the relative density reaches about 94 %, that is, when the open \n\npores gives rise to closed pores. During the final stage, all the porosity becomes isolated and the \n\nincrease in density of the compact is not as high as in previous stages. The number of pores tends \n\nto decrease. In some cases, these closed pores may trap gases, making their elimination difficult.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.II.4.  Illustrations of the stages of sintering: initial package (a), initial stage (b), \n\nintermediate stage (c) and final stage (d) [167] \n\nA few models and a variety of experiments have been proposed and conducted on viscous flow \n\nsintering. The first work on the sintering of glass was originated from the theory of viscous \n\nsintering by Frenkel. Using a simple energy balance (the energy dissipated by viscous flow is \n\nequal to the energy gained by the reduction of surface area during sintering), the Frenkel classical \n\nmodel for the isothermal densification successfully described parts of the sintering process. After \n\na sintering time t, the linear shrinkage (?L) of the sample relative to the original length, L0, is \n\ngiven by Eq.II.3 \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n22 \n\n \n\n                               Eq. II.3 \n\nWhere ?(T) is the temperature-dependent shear viscosity, ? is the glass-vapor surface energy \n\n(whose temperature dependence is very weak), and r is the initial particle radius. Eq.II.3 \n\ndemonstrates that the initial shrinkage rate is inversely proportional to the viscosity and particle \n\nsize. \n\nThe non-isothermal sintering investigation has been performed by dilatometry, using a variety of \n\nheating rates, in order to expand beyond the isothermal mechanistic approach to initial stage sinter \n\nmodeling. \n\nVenkatu [168] developed an initial stage sintering model which includes the heating rate. The \n\nfocus of the work was to determine which of the six sintering mechanisms were the cause of \n\ndimensional change during heating, Eq. II.4. \n\n                   Eq. II.4 \n\nwhere Q' is a constant with the value of 24.27 kJ mol-1, for the viscous flow, ? is a constant that \n\nonly depends on the material and of the sintering mechanism and p is the sintering exponent, \n\nwhich presents the values of p = 1 for viscous flow, p = 2 for volume diffusion and p = 3 for the \n\ndiffusion mechanism by grain contour.  \n\nAn inhibition source of densification is the crystallization of the particles. In the optimum \n\nsintering process, glass full densification should occur before the onset of crystallization. In the \n\nglass sintering, densification occurs in the interval between glass transition temperature and the \n\nonset of crystallization. If this interval is too small, the glass may not have time to fully \n\ndensification prior to initiating crystallization [174]. Crystallization brings a marked reduction in \n\nthe densification by viscous flow, for approximately 10 % of crystals formed, the apparent \n\nviscosity increases about 100 times, resulting in a sudden reduction in the viscous flow with stop \n\nof the shrinkage, which can be observed in dilatometric curves [175].  \n\nThe densification prior crystallization of 10 ?m glass particles is affected by the heating rate as \n\nshowed by Boccaccini et al. [176] in the Ba\u2013Mg\u2013Al\u2013Si\u2013O system. They used two heating rates, \n\none at 15 and another at 1 \u00baC min-1. The crystallization was delayed to higher temperature in the \n\nsample heated at a faster heating rate, and a full densification was obtained. However, at 1 \u00baC min-\n\n1, a densification of 89 % was obtained at the same final temperature.  \n\nShrinkage is also affected by the initial particle size factor [169,170] and consequent degree of \n\nparticle orientation. Glass particles with mixed size distribution sintered about five times faster \n\nthan glasses with equivalent average particle size and spherical uniform size distribution. In \n\nt\nrTL\n\nL\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n)(8\n\n3\n\n0\n?\n\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ???\n?\n\nRT\n\nQQA\ny\n\np\nexp\n\n?\n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n23 \n\n \n\ngeneral, the particle orientation contributes to inhomogeneous green packing and consequent \n\nanisotropic shrinkage behaviour [171,172]. The effects of particle shape (ball-milled and \n\nspheroidized), uniaxially pressed powders effects on shrinkage anisotropy during sintering of \n\ncordierite-type glass [173], showed that both types of particle compacts exhibited around 0.7 \n\nanisotropy factor, but that spheroidizing reduced the shrinkage rate.  \n\nAnisotropy of shrinkage is a common phenomenon in the sintering practice. When sintering a \n\ncylindrical sample, for example, it can be observed that the shrinkage in the axial direction differs \n\nfrom that in the radial direction [171,172,174]. Anisotropic shrinkage appears not to be a simple \n\nparticle shape effect but may be related to particle packing and size distribution in the axial and \n\nradial directions [175,176].  \n\nII.8. Crystallization \n\nDespite the discovery of Bioglass in 1971, there is still no vitreous scaffold structure successfully \n\nproduced [177]. Bioglass crystallizes immediately above the glass transition temperature, yielding \n\na glass ceramic scaffold, resulting in the formation of Na2Ca2Si3O9 as the main crystalline phase \n\n[178,179]. A secondary minor phase, Na2CaSi3O8, is sometimes suggested [180]. Glass-ceramics \n\nare obtained by using an appropriate thermal treatment on the parent glass [57,64,181,182]. The \n\ncomposition of the crystalline phases and the crystallite sizes, within the residual vitreous matrix, \n\ndefine the properties of the final material [182].  \n\nMany bioactive glass-ceramics have reached commercial success (table II.4). Ceravital (apatite-\n\ndevirrite) was the first glass-ceramic material for clinical applications, developed in 1973 [109]. \n\nClinical use of this bioactive material was limited, due to instability of the crystal phase \n\nboundaries in the glass-ceramic.  \n\nOne of the glass-ceramics of higher clinical success is Cerabone \u00ae A-W (apatite-wollastonite), \n\nintroduced by Kokubo in 1982 [43]. So far, the clinical use in vertebral replacement and spinal \n\nrepair has provided acceptable results [183]. In 1983, Holand et al. [70,99], of the University of \n\nJena, developed a new series of bioactive glass-ceramics, called Bioverit\u00ae I (mica\u2013apatite) and \n\nBioverit\u00ae II (mica).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n24 \n\n \n\nTable II.4.

The mechanism of \n\napatite formation on glass-ceramic A-W is essentially the same as that on Bioglass in the Na2O\u2013\n\nCaO\u2013SiO2\u2013P2O5 system. However, glass-ceramic A-W forms an apatite layer on its surface \n\nwithout forming a silica gel layer first as showed by Kitsugi et al. [185]. \n\nThe effect of crystallinity on the apatite formation on Bioglass\u00ae surfaces in vitro [186] revealed \n\nthat the crystal phase Na2Ca2Si3O9 slightly decreased the formation kinetics of such layer on the \n\nglass sample surface but it did not totally suppress it [118,149,187]. It has been suggested that the \n\nprecipitation of the apatite layer depended on the presence of a residual glassy phase in the glass-\n\nceramic [188]. On the contrary, it was found [189] that fully crystallized samples could also \n\ndevelop a crystalline HCA layer, but that the reaction rate significantly reduce with the degree of \n\ncrystallization, for crystallization values higher than 60 vol. % [190,191]. It is possible that the \n\nbioactivity is due to the presence of the Na2Ca2Si3O9 [118], since this crystal phase is bioactive \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n25 \n\n \n\nby itself [70,192], through the transformation of the crystalline phase into a reactive amorphous \n\nphase.  \n\n  \n\nBoccaccini et al. [193] modelled the degradation mechanisms of 45S5 glass-ceramics in three \n\nbasic steps: \n\n(i) Preferential dissolution takes place at the interface between Na2Ca2Si3O9 crystallites \n\nand residual glassy phase. The so-produced gaps allow the physiological solution to \n\npenetrate into the material and to promote a diffused ion leaching from the crystalline \n\nphase.  \n\n(ii) Crystallites progressively break down into very fine grains and the amorphous matrix \n\nis dissolved as a consequence of the ion exchange.  \n\n(iii)  As a consequence, in the end, the crystalline phase changes into an amorphous phase. \n\nIf the crystallization slowed down the bioactivity, it is possible to adjust this parameter through \n\ncontrolled crystallization to match the natural healing rate of bone tissue, through low dissolution \n\nrates as well as low resorptions, according to the requirements of the application. If the bioactive \n\nbehaviour is hindered due to crystalline phases, it is possible to improve the resorption behaviour \n\nby modifying the surface of the material. \n\nII.9. Functionalization \n\nThe surface properties of the glass ceramics are sometimes different from those required by \n\nbiomedical applications. Several approaches have been investigated to optimize the performance \n\nof biomaterials, namely glass ceramics in contact with living tissues [194]. The biomaterial \n\nsurface can be modified by mechanical, physical, chemical or biological treatments, in order to \n\ninduce an appropriate tissue response. Indeed, the variation in chemical functional groups is \n\nknown to affect hydrophobicity, Fig. II.5, which in turn affects protein adsorption and \n\nconformation, subsequently affecting various cellular responses [195].  \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n26 \n\n \n\n \nFig.II.5.  Illustrations of the surface wetting types a) Ordinary Surface \u201ctypical wetting, \n\nb) Hydrophobic \u201cpoor wetting\u201d and c) Hydrophilic \u201cgood wetting\u201d [196] \n\nAmong the variety of methods, silanization has been recently investigated [119,197\u2013201]. Silica \n\nsurface interacts with the silane reagent to form a covalent bond with the surface, Fig. II.6. \n\n \n\nFig.II.6. Schematic of APTES adsorption to the glass-ceramic surface [202,203] \n\nThis attachment, of functional organosilanes to silica and glass substrates, has proven to be an \n\nefficient means of immobilizing antibodies and cellular receptors [201,204]. Successful and \n\nreproducible conditions require a silane uniform monolayer deposition on the glass surface that \n\nrequires a cleaned surface. The cleaning treatment process is important to promote both surface \n\nremoval of contaminants and exposure of reactive hydroxyls. Several cleaning methods have been \n\nproposed in the literature, such as the use of acetone [205,206], acids or alkali treatments [207]. \n\nThe acids commonly used include hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, hydrofluoric acid, and nitric \n\nacid. Alkali treatment involves immersion of the implants in either sodium or potassium \n\nhydroxide followed by heat treatment and rinsing in distilled water.  \n\nAfter surface activation silanization can be performed. The most common silane coupling agent \n\nused is 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) [208,209], which reacts with the free hydroxyl \n\ngroups of activated carriers to generate silane modified surfaces, Fig. II.6. The amine groups of \n\n\n\nII \u2013 Literature review \n\n27 \n\n \n\nthe silane modified surface react with a dialdehyde cross linker forming an aldehyde derivatized \n\nsurface, which further reacts with the free amino groups of the antibody/protein to be immobilized.  \n\nSince bioactive glasses have the ability to undergo ion-exchange processes which, in contact with \n\nsimulated body fluid (SBF) [210\u2013213], leads to the formation of silanols, and then to the further \n\nsteps of hydroxyapatite formation, it seems to be possible to pre-activate the surface to enhance \n\nthe cell responses [194,206]. However, the fast condensation of silanols to silica gel imposes a \n\ndeep control of surface cleaning and activation to preserve the presence of free -OH groups on it.  \n\nThe Bioglass\u00ae derived glass-ceramic scaffold [206] was exposed to surface functionalization \n\n(acetone + APTES) and further grafting with alkaline phosphatase, to disrupt the stable \n\nNa2Ca2Si3O9 crystalline phase, further enhancing the formation of the calcium phosphate phase \n\nin SBF.  \n\nReferences  \n\n[1] J.

A description of the experimental aspects from the production of the \n\nglasses, sample preparation and sample characterization is presented.   \n\n \n\nChapter III \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\nIII.1. Materials \n\nIn this thesis four compositions of calcium phosphate glasses were produced which are presented in \n\nTable III.1.  \n\nTable III.1.

The \n\nmelt was kept at this temperature, for 2 h, to ensure the attainment of high homogeneity. \n\nAll the reagents presented analytical purity and were not submitted to further purification Table \n\nIII.2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\nTable III.2.

The function of the salt is to act as an intermediary phase \n\namong the glass particles, being easily removed by dissolution after the thermal consolidation of \n\nthe part. \n\nIII.2. Sample preparation \n\nGlasses were prepared in both bulk and frit form.  \n\nIII.2.1. Bulk samples \n\nThe bulks were obtained by pouring the melt into a stainless steel plate to obtain glass blocks \n\nfollowed by glass annealing at temperatures above Tg, for 30 minutes, and then slow cooled to \n\nroom temperature. The dimensions of the blocks were approximately 40 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 7 mm3. The \n\nannealed bulk glass samples were cut into slices (~4mm thickness) using a low speed (275 rpm) \n\ndiamond saw (Buehler ISOMET 1000 Precision Saw). The slices were cleaned in an ultrasonic \n\nbath with alcohol for 15 minutes. \n\nIII.2.2. Glass powder \n\nThe glass powders were produced from glass frits, which were obtained by quenching the glass \n\nmelts in cold water. The frits were dried in a heating chamber at 60 \u00ba C, then milled for 20 to 30 \n\nmin, depending on the composition and particle size distribution, in an agate mill, and sieved in \n\norder to obtain a fine powder with particle size ? 20 ?m. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n47 \n\n \n\nIII.2.3. Glass powder compacts \n\nRectangular bars (5 x 5 x 10 cm3) with a green density of 1.60 \u00b1 0.01 (corresponding to 0.60 of \n\nrelative density) were obtained by uniaxial pressing at 175 MPa, for 30 s, using a hydraulic press \n\n(CARVER Laboratory Press \u2013 Model C). \n\nThe samples were sintered up to 850 \u00baC, in non-isothermal conditions.  \n\nSome glass compact samples have been mounted in thermosetting resin (before and after sintering) \n\nand dried in air atmosphere. After mounting, the glass sintered compact samples were ground with \n\nabrasives in order to obtain the desired surface finishing. After that, a fine polishing was performed \n\nusing 6, 3 and 1?m diamond pastes, for further microstructural studies. \n\nIII.2.4. Glass scaffolds \n\nGlass-salt mixtures with NaCl average particle sizes in the range of 212-500 ?m, and varying \n\nweight contents (0, 10, 30, 50, 60, 70, 90 and 100 wt. %) were mechanical mixed, during 15 min, in \n\na turbula shaker-mixer, from Glen Mils, USA. The weight amount of the glass and salt powder in \n\nthe mixture was estimated using the rule of the mixtures of binary composites. \n\nBefore sintering, the mixture powders were uniaxially pressed in a 10 mm diameter die. Cylindrical \n\nglass/salt compacts with an initial geometrical density of 1.60 \u00b1 0.02 g.cm-3 were obtained by \n\nuniaxially pressing at 175 MPa. \n\nThe best conditions for thermal cycling were established from the dilatometric curves. \n\nAfter sintering, the salt crystals were leached using distilled stirring water at 30 \u00baC for 1 day to \n\nform the scaffold pores. The water was changed at intervals of 1 hour for the first 6 h and \n\napproximately 2 h for the remaining immersion time.  \n\nThe pore size can be controlled by the size of the salt crystals, and the porosity by the glass/salt \n\nweight ratio. The samples weight was recorded after and before sintering, in order to control the \n\nsalt losses and ensure that all the salt had been leached to avoid unexpected impact on cells in \n\nfuture studies. \n\nIII.2.5. Glass-ceramic bulk and scaffolds crystallization \n\nBulk and scaffolds glass-ceramics samples were prepared following a one-stage crystallisation \n\nprocess. The glass samples were heated at 5 \u00baC min?1 up to the optimum crystallisation temperature, \n\nas revealed by DTA studies, and held for the optimum crystallisation time. After heat treatment, the \n\nbulk samples were polished with diamond pastes of 15, 6, 3 and 1\u00b5m particle size. \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nIII.3. Samples Characterization \n\nIII.3.1. Powders particle size distribution and specific surface area \n\nIn order to determine the morphological characteristics of the glass powders, powder particle size \n\ndistributions were carried out by a laser particle size Coulter LS Particle Size Analyser 230, \n\nFraunhofer optical model, Amherst, MA. The particle size distribution of the sodium chloride was \n\ncarried out by sieving with cuts at 212 and 500 micrometres. \n\nThe specific surface area of the glass powders, salt and scaffolds were determined by physical \n\nadsorption of nitrogen gas, using the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) method. For those tests, a \n\nQuantachrome Quantasorb equipment, Germany, was used, and before determining the volume of \n\nadsorbed gas, samples were kept under vacuum at 200 \u00b0C, for 4 h.  \n\nIII.3.2. Density \n\nThe real powder density of glass powders was determined by helium pycnometry (Accupyc 1330 \n\npycnometer).  \n\nThe density of the CaO\u2013P2O5\u2013SiO2\u2013MgO glass system compacts, at given temperatures during \n\nsintering, was determined from the green density and the measured shrinkage using the relation, \n\ngiven by Eq. III.1, \n\n? =\n?0\n\n((1??a/a0)\n2 (1??h/h0))\n\n                            (Eq. III.1) \n\nwhere h and a are the length and width of the samples. \n\nThe final density of the sintered compacts was also determined by using the Archimedes principle. \n\n \n\nThe green density of the glass/salt mixtures was geometrically measured. The theoretic density of \n\nthe glass/salt mixture was estimated using the rule of the mixtures, equation III.2, \n\n1\n\n??,?\n=\n\n?????\n?????\n\n+\n???\n\n???\n (Eq. III.2) \n\nwhere ?t,m- theoretic mixture density, ?salt \u2013 salt density,  ?fr  - glass density,  frf  - glass powder \n\nvolume fraction and saltf - salt powder volume fraction. \n\nThe apparent scaffold density of the sintered scaffolds was determined geometrically. \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n49 \n\n \n\nIII.3.3. Thermal analysis \n\nDifferential thermal analysis (DTA) of the glasses and of the salt was performed at a constant \n\nheating rate of 5 \u00baC min-1 in a SETARAM LABSYS equipment, in order to identify the nature of \n\nthe reactions that occur during heating and the corresponding temperatures. For the glass system \n\nCaO\u2013P2O5\u2013SiO2\u2013MgO, this analysis was performed within a range of heating rates from 5 to 40 \u00b0C \n\nmin-1 to study the crystallization mechanism and calculate the relevant parameters associated. The \n\nonset of crystallization peak temperature (Tc), the crystallization peak temperature (Tp) and the \n\nheating rate (?) were used to discern the crystallization behaviour of glasses in this system. \n\n \n\nDilatometry allows the in-situ monitoring of any sample dimensional changes with the temperature \n\nvariation. It was performed on pressed glass, salt and glass/salt mixture powders. This \n\ncharacterization was done up to 1000 \u00b0C, at constant heating rate conditions in a horizontal Bahr \n\nThermo Dilatometer DIL801L, H\u00fcllhorst, Germany. For the glass system CaO\u2013P2O5\u2013SiO2\u2013MgO, \n\nthis analysis was performed within a range of heating rates from 5 to 20 \u00b0C min-1 to study the \n\ncrystallization mechanism and calculate relevant parameters associated. \n\nThe mean values and the standard deviations (SD) presented for the thermal expansion coefficient \n\n(CTE) determined for all glasses in the studied compositions, have been obtained from the \n\ncharacterization on each of three samples, using compact powders (10 mm diameter and 5 mm \n\nthick). \n\nIII.3.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD)  \n\nThe crystallographic characterization was performed at room temperature in a Geigerflex powder \n\ndiffractometer Rigaku D / Max S\u00e9rieC equipped with a curved graphite monochromator using \n\nCuK? radiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed of 0.02\u00ba s-1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) \n\ntechnique was used to evaluate the presence of crystalline phases in the powder compacts. The \n\nidentification of crystalline phases was made using the base PDF (Powder Diffraction File) data \n\nprovided by JCPDS / ICDD (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards / International \n\nCentre for Diffraction Data, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, USA). \n\n \n\nThe amount of the crystalline phase (crystallized volume fraction) contained in the glass-ceramic \n\nbulk and scaffold samples was determined according to the procedure used by Krimm and \n\nTobolsky [1]. The percent crystallinity, CI, was calculated by the ratio of the crystalline area, CA, \n\npresent in the diffractogram of the glass-ceramics and the total area, TA (amorphous + crystalline), \n\npresent in this diffractogram using Eq. III.3 [2]: \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n                      CI = (CA/TA) x 100                                           (Eq. III.3) \n\nIII.3.5. High temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) \n\nThe formation of the crystalline phases within the glass powder was also followed by high \n\ntemperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) using a Philips X'Pert diffractometer, model MRD and \n\nalso Cu-Ka radiation. Data were collected in a continuous scan type from 10\u00ba to 70\u00ba, with a step \n\nsize of 0.02\u00ba and a counting time of 1 s per step. The in situ analysis was performed on glass \n\npowders each 10 \u00baC while being heated in air, from 770 to 900 \u00baC, using a heating rate of 10 \u00baC \n\nmin-1 and a dwell time of 45 min per scan.  \n\nIII.3.6. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) \n\nFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy provides information about the chemical bonding or \n\nmolecular structure of materials. The spectra were collected using a FTIR, Brucker tensor 27. For \n\nthis purpose, the glass powder and scaffolds (reduced to powder) samples were mixed with KBr \n\n(ratio 1:10) and pressed into a pellet using a hand press.  \n\nThe FTIR spectra of the bulk samples was recorded using a Golden Gate single reflection diamond \n\nATR system, with no need for sample preparation.  \n\nAll spectra were collected over a region of 4000\u2013400 cm?1 and are the average of two independent \n\nmeasurements with 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm?1. \n\nIII.3.7. Magic angle spinning-Nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) \n\nGlasses containing 6 and 0 % sodium oxide were investigated by 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance \n\n(MAS-NMR) spectroscopy to determine the distributions of SiO4 structural units, Qn, where n is \n\nthe number of bridging oxygen atoms bound to other Si atoms, as a function of composition. 29Si \n\nMAS-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ASX 400 spectrometer operating at 79.52 MHz (9.4 \n\nT) using a 7 mm probe at a spinning rate of 5 kHz. The pulse length was 2 \u00b5s and a 60s delay time \n\nwas used. Kaolinite was used as the chemical shift reference. \n\nIII.3.8. Beam bending method - Viscosity \n\nViscosity, ?, is probably one of the most important properties in glass making because it strongly \n\ninfluences the melting, fining and pouring conditions of the glass. During glass forming processes \n\nthe viscosity must be tightly controlled to maintain a high product quality. A three point beam \n\nbending method was used to evaluate the viscosity. The measurements were performed in a Bahr \n\nThermo analyse equipment (type 401), carried out under a stress of 0.45 MPa at 10 \u00baC min-1, in the \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n51 \n\n \n\nglass transition range as described in ISO 7884-4 [3] and ASTM C1350 [4]. These analysis were \n\nperformed in the Otto Schott Institute of Materials Research (OSIM) at the Friedrich Schiller \n\nUniversity of Jena, Germany. \n\nIII.3.9. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) was the technique utilized to perform the microstructural \n\ncharacterization of all samples. The SEM equipment used is a Hitachi, Model SU-70, with a \n\nmaximum acceleration potential of 25 KeV and a resolution of 15\u00c5, coupled with X-ray energy \n\ndispersive spectroscopy (EDS). \n\nFor glass powders observation, a drop of powder suspension in 2-propanol (0.1g/10ml) was \n\ndeposited on aluminum sample holders further dried at 60 \u00b0C.  \n\nSodium chloride powders were deposited on a double-sided carbon tape-adhesive.  \n\nThe crystalline phases were observed by SEM using fracture surfaces of the compacts and scaffolds, \n\nunder HCl acid attack for 3 seconds. All compact and bulk samples were fixed with glue carbon \n\n(Neubauer Chemikalien, M\u00fcnster, Germany). \n\nAll samples were coated with a thin carbon film by deposition on Emitech K950 equipment. The \n\nelemental compositions of the samples were qualitatively identified by EDS in the SEM. \n\nIII.3.10. ImageJ analysis \n\nImageJ is a Java based image processing and analysis software developed by the U. S. National \n\nInstitutes of Health, of public domain (available from http://imagej.nih.gov/). Parameters like grain \n\nsize, median aspect ratio (defined as the major axis divided by the minor axis) and orientation \n\ndistribution were determined through image analysis of SEM micrographs, using the ImageJ \n\nfreeware, as detailed in Chapter IV. Editing functions used comprise contrast manipulation, \n\nsharpening, and edge detection. The calculation of area and pixel value statistics were performed \n\nusing analysis functions.  \n\nTo perform the image analysis, SEM micrographs were generally modified in the following way: \n\ncontrast enhancement, median filtering and thresholding to obtain suitable binary images, Fig. III.1. \n\nThe particles\u2019 sections were manually drawn and evaluated before and after thresholding to avoid \n\nerrors in particles\u2019 area, Fig. III.1b. An elliptical shape was assumed for the quantitative analysis of \n\ngrain shape and orientation, Fig. III.1c. \n\n \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. III.1. Image processing for microstructure characterization: (a) raw image, (b) after \nmanual drawing of particles and binarization, (c) resulting ellipses. \n\nAn orientation factor was assumed to quantify the degree of shape anisotropy and orientation of the \n\nparticles. Concerning particle orientation analysis, the direction perpendicular to the press \n\nconformation (x-plane direction) corresponds to 0\u00b0 and the parallel direction to 90 \u00ba. This \n\norientation factor is defined as the fraction of weighted cumulative lengths (sum of the length \n\nmultiplied by the aspect ratio) of particles with orientation in the ranges 0\u00b0- 45\u00b0 and 135\u00ba - 180\u00ba, as \n\nschematically represented in Fig. III.2. \n\n \n\nFig. III.2. Illustration of the directions used for shrinkage quantification in the different \nplanes (a) and scheme of the orientation range (0 \u00ba - 45 \u00ba and 135 \u00ba -180 \u00ba) considered in \n\nthe orientation factor) (b). \n\nAround 900 particles in 3 micrographs were considered for every sample. The error was \n\ndetermined by the standard deviation of the values obtained from the different images. \n\nIII.3.11. Static contact angle \n\nIn order to study the changes of the wettability of the glass-ceramic surfaces after surface \n\nmodification treatments, static contact angle measurements were obtained by the sessile drop \n\nmethod [5] using a contact angle meter OCA15+ with high-performance image processing system \n\nfrom DataPhysics Instruments, Germany.  \n\nUltrapure water (with a resistivity of 18.2 MU cm) obtained with a Milli-Q Ultrapure water \n\npurification system (Millipore, Bedford MA, USA) was added by a motor driven syringe, at room \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n53 \n\n \n\ntemperature. Three measurements were taken in different regions and an averaged on each of five \n\nsamples for each surface modification treatment, was considered.  \n\nIII.3.12. Scaffold Porosity \n\nThe porosity of the scaffolds from each experimental group (n = 5 to 10 per group) was determined \n\nfrom the ratio of the measured apparent scaffold density and calculated theoretical scaffold density.  \n\nMercury intrusion porosimetry was also performed to characterize the macropores in the porous \n\nstructure, based on the phenomenon of capillary rise of non-wetting liquid like mercury. Pressure is \n\nneeded for the mercury to overcome the capillary force and intrude into the pores. To fill smaller \n\npores, higher pressure is required. Therefore, the mercury volume intrusion into pores as a function \n\nof applied pressure reveals the information of the pore size distribution. \n\nIn principle, the mercury intrusion porosimeter can measure the pore size from 6 nm to 350 ?m, \n\nwhich is determined by the highest pressure and lower pressure of 4.45 and 0.5 psia, respectively. \n\nHowever, there is always some inter-space between the sample and the wall of the chamber, where \n\nmercury cannot enter during the pre-filling. This makes the high-end measurement accuracy of \n\nlarge pores questionable. On the other hand, for the low end of the measurement, the high pressure \n\nmight crack the fragile small pores walls, which could make the results inaccurate.  \n\nOverall, for our porous glass material, the practical range of this technique was from 100 nm to 300 \n\n?m. It was used an AutoPore IV 9500 V1.07 serial 734 porosimeter (Micromeritics) in Institute \n\nPedro Nunes, Coimbra. A pressure of 0.5 psia (0.0034 MPa) was applied to pre-fill the chamber \n\nwith mercury. The pressure then increases step-wisely for generating intrusion curve, which was \n\nused to calculate pore size distribution. \n\nIII.3.13. Scaffold water absorption \n\nWater absorption measurements were performed on the sintered porous samples. The mass of \n\nleached samples was measured under various conditions: dry (\nd\n\nw ) and wet (\nw\n\nw ). The wet mass \n\nmeasurements were made after immersion in water, removing excess water from the sample \n\nsurface with a plain paper, not very absorbent. The water absorption (WA) is given by equation \n\nIII.4: \n\n? ?\n100% ??\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n\nd\n\ndw\n\nw\n\nww\nWA  (Eq. III.4) \n\nAll measurements were performed on 3 or more samples. \n\n \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\nIII.3.14. Scaffold Mechanical properties \n\nThe study of the mechanical properties of the produced bioactive glass scaffolds was focused on \n\nthe mechanical response in compression loading only, giving values of the compressive strength \n\nand of the elastic modulus for the selected deformation rate. Six cylindrical leached samples, \n\nwith 10 mm diameter and 10 mm thick were subjected to compression tests in a universal \n\nmechanical testing machine Zwick / Roell Z020, at 0.5 mm min-1 and a cell load of 20 KN. Prior to \n\nmechanical testing, the contact surfaces of each sample were ground to produce smooth parallel \n\nsurfaces.  \n\nThe elastic modulus from compression tests was determined from the initial linear region of the \n\nstress\u2013stain curve and the average compressive strength, taken as the highest stress on the stress\u2013\n\nstrain curve, for six samples tested.  \n\nIII.4. In vitro evaluation \n\nIII.4.1. Bioactivity studies  \n\nThe definition of bioactive was given by Hench [6], who initiated this subject of research with his \n\ncolleagues in the early 1970s, \u201ca bioactive material is one that elicits a specific biological response \n\nat the interface of the material which results in the formation of a bond between the tissues and the \n\nmaterial\u201d. The use of simulated body fluid (SBF) as first proposed by Kokubo et al. [7], allows to \n\nmake an in vitro evaluation of the ability to precipitate calcium phosphates on its surface, the first \n\nindication of a potentially bioactive material.  \n\nIII.4.1.1. Simulated body fluid (SBF) \n\nConventional simulated body fluid (1.0 SBF) was chosen as proposed by the Technical Committee \n\nISO 23317 of International Organization for Standardization, in 2012, for in vitro evaluation for \n\napatite-forming ability of implant materials [8]. The SBF was synthesised by adding the reagent-\n\ngrade chemicals in the order listed in Table III.3 into distilled water, and buffered at pH 7.40 with \n\ntrishydroxymethyl-aminomethane ((CH2OH)3CNH2) and 1.0M hydrochloric acid at 36.5 \u00baC. This \n\nSBF is an aproteic and acellular solution with pH and composition simulating those of the human \n\nplasma (Table III.4). The SBF solution was prepared according to the formulation of Kokubo and \n\nTakadama [9]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n55 \n\n \n\nTable III.3.

To better understand the nature of the precipitated layer and also to obtain a \n\nsufficiently representative thickness layer, crystalline bulk samples were also analyzed for 10, 20, \n\n30 days and 5 months. Subsequently, the samples were placed in polyethylene bottles containing \n\nSBF, and kept for various periods of time, without shaking, in an incubator at 37 \u00baC, in accordance \n\nwith a protocol referred in literature [10\u201313]. Four samples were used for each immersion time, \n\nchapter VI to VIII. A constant specimen surface area to solution volume ratio of 0.1 cm?1 was used \n\nin the immersion tests, previously filtered through a Milipore 0.22 ?m system. For the scaffolds it \n\nwas considered the value of the surface area given by the BET method. After removal from the \n\nSBF, the samples were washed in distillated water and dried at 60 \u00baC.  \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nIII.4.1.2. Apatite layer characterization \n\nAfter SBF immersion, the apatite layer deposited on the samples was detected by SEM/EDS. The \n\nmicrostructural observation of the samples\u2019 surface, before and after immersion in SBF, was \n\ncarried out by SEM in the equipment referred in Section III.3.9.  \n\nSurface modifications of the materials after immersion were also studied by XRD, reducing the \n\nsamples to powder. \n\nThe chemical structure of the glass and glass-ceramic surfaces, before and after SBF immersion, \n\nwas analysed by Fourier transform attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).  \n\nIII.4.1.3. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP) \n\nElemental concentrations of the SBF before and after soaking of the glass and glass-ceramic \n\nsamples (plates and scaffolds) were measured as a function of the immersion time [14], using \n\ninductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (Jobin Yvon 70 Plus, France), at the \n\nLaborat\u00f3rio Central de An\u00e1lises from the University of Aveiro. \n\nIII.4.2. Biocompatibility studies \n\nBiocompatible glasses and glass-ceramics are desired to generate the most appropriate beneficial \n\ncellular or tissue response in a specific situation. However, the definition does not explain what \n\ntype of glass dissolution behaviour is desired in various applications. To understand the influence \n\nof the presence of biomaterials on cells, osteoblast cells have been used in different tests. Cell \n\nmorphology, adhesion and proliferation were examined and then, cell activity was tested by \n\nmeasuring the amount of some specific enzymes produced, in this study, alkaline phosphatase.  \n\nIII.4.2.1. Human bone marrow cells \n\nIn order to study the morphology, attachment and proliferation, Fig. III.3, of osteoblastic cell \n\ncultures over the glass bulk slices and scaffold surfaces, a human bone marrow (HBM) osteoblastic \n\ncell culture was used. \n\nHuman marrow cells, obtained from orthopaedic surgery procedures (after patient informed \n\nconsent), was cultured, in ?- Minimal Essential Medium (?-MEM) supplemented with 10 % Fetal \n\nBovine Serum (FBS, Biochrome, Germany) and 100 mg.ml-1 penicillin, 10 IU streptomycin and 2.5 \n\nmg ml-1 fungizone, in controlled atmosphere conditions (37 \u00baC, 5 % CO2, 100 % humidity). \n\nDetachment of confluent low passage cells was performed using 0.05 % tripsin and 0.25 % EDTA \n\nsolution (Sigma, USA), for 10 min at 37 \u00baC. Subsequently, HBM cells were cultured over samples \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n57 \n\n \n\nin a concentration of 105 cell ml-1 and incubated in controlled atmosphere conditions for 24 h and 6 \n\ndays (results in Chapter VII) and up to 21 days (chapter IX).  \n\nAfter each incubation period, samples were washed with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS, Sigma, \n\nUSA) solution and fixed in Gluteraldehyde 2.5 % (V/V) for observation by means of CLSM, \n\nLeica SP2 AOBS. After fixation, samples were dehydrated in crescent ethanol concentrations \n\n(50 %, 70 %, 90 % and 100 %), air-dried and sputter-coated with gold. \n\n \n\nFig. III.3. Cell attachment and spreading mechanism [15]. \n\n \n\nIII.4.2.2. Cell viability/proliferation \n\nCellular cytotoxicity and viability/proliferation at each time period, was measured on triplicate \n\nsamples by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrasodium bromide) colorimetric \n\nmethod, first developed by Mosmann [16]. \n\nThis test is based on the capacity of viable cells to metabolize tetrazolium salt by forming purple \n\nformazan crystals, which can be dissolved and quantified by measuring the absorbance of the \n\nsolution at 600 nm in an ELISA reader (Synergy HT; Biotek) and is commonly used for cell \n\nviability evaluation. Cells were then incubated for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere \n\ncontaining 5 % CO2 with 0.5 mg.ml\n-1 of MTT, followed by material samples wash with PBS for \n\nmacroscopic surface area observation. Results were evidenced by the formation of a dark purple \n\nstaining and expressed as A.cm-2. \n\nIII.4.2.3. Alkaline phosphatase activity \n\nThe colonized materials were treated with 0.1 % triton in water (to lyse the cell layer) and the cell \n\nlysates were evaluated for alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and total protein content. ALP was \n\nassessed by the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol phosphate in alkaline buffer solution, pH 10.3, for 30 \n\nmin at 37 \u00baC. The resultant products are phosphate and p-nitrophenol. The last, turns the resultant \n\nsolution into yellow, which can be measured by colorimetric determination at k = 405 nm. Results \n\nare expressed in nanomoles of p-nitrophenol produced per min per \u00b5g of protein (nmol min-1/\u00b5g \n\nprotein). \n\n\n\nIII \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nIII.4.2.4.

Our main goal was to \n\ncarry out a comprehensive study of the bioactive glass sintering, identifying the powder and sintering \n\nvariables effect on densification, for future design of sintered glassy materials with competent \n\nmicrostructures for functional applications in biological systems. This study was performed by \n\ndilatometric measurements, at different heating rates, using glass powders with different particle size \n\ndistributions and detailed microstructural analysis with quantification of anisotropic parameters. The \n\nglass powder compacts could be densified at sintering temperature below 800 \u00baC through viscous \n\nsintering. The activation energy of sintering, Es, was evaluated by the application of Venkatu\u2019s \n\nequation for non-isothermal conditions and similar values were found for compacts with different \n\nparticle size distributions. \n\nWhen using the dilatometer, the load exerted on the sample by the dilatometer push-rod induced a \n\nsignificant increase of shrinkage anisotropy. The measured value of k for sintering under the \n\ndilatometric load and for the free sintering were always k>1, i.e., the samples shrank less in the \n\ndirection of shaping pressing of green compacts. However, an interesting finding was that by a small \n\nadjustment of particle size distribution and decrease of the average powder particle size, from 6.8 to \n\n3.5 \u00b5m, very different sintered microstructures could be obtained. Near full densification and \n\nnegligible microstructural anisotropy was reached before crystallization in the finer glass compacts, \n\nwhereas the coarser glass powder compact presents reduced final density and microstructural \n\nanisotropy.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5-SiO2-MgO system \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nIV.1. Introduction \n\nSintering of glass powder is a physical process that occurs by viscous flow [1]. It has the advantages \n\nof the attainment of different controllable porosities and complex forms, varying the format of the \n\npressing mold, which cannot be acquired by the usual techniques of glass conformation. In scaffold \n\nfabrication to understand the sintering conditions of the base glass powders and the interaction \n\nbetween sintering and crystallization of the material is essential. By knowing the thermal behaviour \n\nand, consequently, the structural transformations of glasses, the process can be optimized to achieve \n\nthe highest possible densification of the scaffold. Densification of the glass prior to crystallization is \n\nparticularly important since the crystallization brings an accented reduction of densification for \n\nviscous flow: for about 10 % of the crystals formed, apparent viscosity increases about 100 times, \n\nimplying an abrupt reduction of the viscous flow with shrinkage stopping that is observed in \n\ndilatometric curves [2]. If the crystallization stage begins before or during the sintering process, the \n\nresultant compact will have sufficiently porosity and heterogeneities due to the existence of \n\ncrystalline phase in the glass matrix. In the glass sintering, if the interval between Tg and Tc \n\n(crystallization temperature) is too small, the glass will not have enough time for completely \n\ndensification before crystallization. In the contraire, if the sintering stage finishes before the \n\nbeginning of crystallization, a denser compact will be gotten with lower porosity [3].  \n\nThe particle size is an important factor in the sintering of the glass [3\u20135]. Compact density increases \n\nwith the biggest and smallest particle size ratio. Cutler and  Henrichsen [6] had verified that glass \n\nparticles with a varied distribution sizes and raised superficial area densified about five times more \n\nquickly than glasses with an equivalent average particle size but with a much uniform size \n\ndistribution. \n\nThe ability to predict the final shrinkage of a sintering compact along its axes will enable to control \n\nthe shape of the final product. Some equations, based on the Frenkel\u2019s model [7,8], had been \n\nproposed to describe the linear shrinkage in the initial stage of sintering and have been used in some \n\ncrystalline or amorphous systems, namely in non-isothermal conditions, with constant heating rates. \n\nHowever, anisotropic sintering is often observed in porous glass systems and in this case the \n\nFrenkel\u00b4s model fails in the prediction of the overall shrinkage [9\u201311]. Anisotropic green \n\nmicrostructure can be formed during the shaping process as a result of many factors, the most \n\nfrequent being non-equiaxed particle shape, particle alignment and non-uniform packing [11\u201313] \n\nwhich will give rise to anisotropic shrinkage behavior during sintering. Although an increased \n\nattention and relevant comprehensive studies have being done in anisotropic sintering of different \n\nsystems, more research is yet missing for a full understanding of the factors governing the anisotropic \n\ndensification.     \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5 -SiO2 \u2013MgO system \n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nIn this work the anisotropic sintering of a Ca-P-Si-Mg glass powder with different particles size \n\ndistributions was investigated. The effects of the particle size distribution on the particle alignment \n\nduring shaping and of the packing characteristics together with the heating rate on the shrinkage \n\nbehavior were investigated. \n\nIV.2. Material and Methods \n\nReagent-grade powders of SiO2, CaCO3, Ca(H2PO4)2 and MgO were mixed in the required \n\nproportions to obtain a glass with the nominal composition (wt. %) 54.89 % 3CaO.P2O5 ? 24.81 % \n\nSiO2 ?  20.30 % MgO. The raw materials were wet mixed in ethanol in an agate mill, for 45 min, and \n\ndried at 60 \u00baC. Batches of 80 g were melted in a platinum crucible at 1500 \u00baC, for 2h, in air, and then \n\nquenched into cold water. After quenching in water, a homogenous, transparent glass was obtained. \n\nThe amorphous state of the glass was confirmed by XRD analysis of powdered samples, in a Rigaku \n\nDiffractometer Geigerflex Dmax-C, Japan, at room temperature with CuK? radiation at a scan speed \n\nof 0.02\u00ba s-1. The XRD patterns were recorded in the 2? range of 10?80 degree. \n\nThe glass was crushed in an agate ball mill for different periods of time and sieved to collect a fine \n\nfraction bellow 20 \u00b5m and an average particle size d50 of 3.5 and 6.8 \u00b5m using alcohol as solvent. \n\nThe particle size measurements of the powdered glasses were carried out by a laser particle size \n\nCoulter LS Particle Size Analyser 230, Fraunhofer optical model, Amherst, MA.   \n\nDTA analysis of the glass particles was performed in order to assess the temperature range suitable \n\nfor thermal treatments. The analysis was performed in a differential thermal analyzer Labsys Setaram \n\nTG-DTA/DSC, France, at a heating rate of 10 \u00baC min-1 from room temperature to 1000 \u00baC in air, \n\nusing alumina (Al2O3) as a reference.  \n\nThe density of the glass was determined as 2.65\u00b10.05 g cm-3 at 25 \u00baC by helium pycnometry in a \n\nQuantaChrome equipment and further taken as theoretical density under the assumption that no \n\nclosed porosity was present in the measured particles.  \n\nRectangular bars (5 x 5 x 10 cm3) with a green density of 1.60 \u00b1 0.01 (corresponding to 0.60 of \n\nrelative density) were obtained by uniaxial pressing at 175 MPa, for 30 sec, as represented in Fig. \n\nIV.1. \n\n \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5-SiO2-MgO system \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe sintering behavior in non-isothermal conditions was investigated at constant heating rate \n\ndilatometry, using a Bahr Thermo Analyse DIL 801 L, Germany and heating rates from 5 to 20 \u00baC \n\nmin-1 until a maximum temperature of 850 \u00baC.  \n\nThe density of the compacts at given temperatures during sintering was determined from the green \n\ndensity and the measured shrinkage using the relation, given by Eq. IV.1,  \n\n? =\n?0\n\n(1??? ?0? )\n2 (1??? ?0)?\n\n                (Eq. IV.1) \n\nThe final density of the sintered compacts was also determined by using the Archimedes principle. \n\nAverage values of  x- and y- shrinkage were calculated from 5 samples. With this data, the coefficient \n\nof shrinkage anisotropy, K, can be defined by the ratio between perpendicular and parallel strains, \n\naccording to Eq. IV.2,  \n\n       ? =\n??\n\n??\n=\n\nln(? ?0? )\n\nln(? ?0? ))\n                   (Eq. IV.2) \n\nIn order to characterize the particles orientation, the microstructure of the cross-sections in the y- and \n\nx- planes was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM in a Hitachi, Model SU-70 equipment \n\nat an accelerating voltage of 25 KeV. Prior to SEM analysis, the planes of sintered specimen were \n\nfinished with diamante slurry and sputtered with carbon.  \n\nFrom the original micrographs a binary image was created, with the grains in blank and the pores or \n\nresin in black, as exemplify in Fig. IV. 2. For the image analysis, the software ImageJ was used by \n\ndefining a threshold value to convert the micrograph into binary pictures (Fig. IV. 2b). The shape of \n\nthe particles was detected automatically and the desired information determined, not taken into \n\naccount the particles located at the edge of the picture. To measure the degree of particle orientation \n\nand aspect ratio it was used the \u201cbest-fit ellipse method\u201d, Fig. IV.2c. \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5 -SiO2 \u2013MgO system \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nIV.3. Results and Discussion \n\nThe amorphous nature of the as quenched glasses was confirmed by XRD, curve not shown. The \n\nparticle size distributions of the glass powders, after milling and sieving are represented in Fig. IV.3. \n\nIt is possible to observe a particle size distribution varying between ~0.04 up to ~20 ?m with an \n\naverage particle size at 50 vol. % of 3.5 ?m for G3 and a slight wider distribution for G6, with a \n\nlarger fraction of coarser particles extending up to ~33 ?m and an average size of 6.8 ?m. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe thermal behaviour of the glass powder G3 was characterized by DTA and dilatometry at 10 \u00baC \n\nmin-1 and the respective curves are shown in Fig. IV.4. The beginning of sintering occurred at ~710 \n\n\u00baC, after the endothermic occurrence in DTA curve, which corresponds to the glass transition region \n\nin the range of 708?730 \u00baC.  \n\nIt can be observed two regions of shrinkage in the dilatometric curve: the first one, region I, where \n\nthe densification predominantly occurs (~14 % of shrinkage was attained) with the ending fairly \n\nclose to the onset of the crystallization temperature (Tc), ~825 \u00baC. The second regimen, region II, \n\noccurred in competition with the devitrification process, presenting a slow densification process, \n\nleading to ~2 % of additional shrinkage.  \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5-SiO2-MgO system \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Shrinkage kinetic analysis  \n\nThe shrinkage (y) and shrinkage rate (dy/dt) of the two powder compacts with varying heating rates \n\nare presented in Fig. IV.5. Shrinkage curves show a sigmoidal characteristic shape with temperature \n\nand shifted to higher temperatures with increasing heating rate [14,15]. \n\nThe influence of the particle size distribution on the sintering rate was also clearly observed. A \n\nmaximum shrinkage of 8 % was obtained for the coarser powder at 810 \u00baC (2 \u00baC min-1), while 11.5 % \n\ndensification was reached for the finer powder, at the same heating rate and temperature. This effect \n\nis correspondent to a higher shrinkage rate for the finer powder as can be observed in Fig. IV.4b. By \n\ncomparing the maximum of the shrinkage rate at the same heating rate, it is very clear its increase \n\nwith the decreasing of the average particle size, as expected from the sintering kinetic laws [5]. Above \n\nthe maximum shrinkage rate, two processes occur in simultaneous competing between itself, namely \n\nthe viscous flow and the nucleation and growth of crystalline phase. It seems that the higher the \n\nheating rate is, the higher the onset temperature for the crystallization, as already observed elsewhere \n\n[16,17].  \n\nBoccaccini et al. [16] fully densified glass particle compacts when heated at ? = 15 \u00b0C min\u20131 to \n\n1050 \u00b0C, however, the same powders densified to only 89 % at ? = 1 \u00baC min\u20131, thus confirming that \n\nhigh heating rates favored sintering in detriment to crystallization.  \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5 -SiO2 \u2013MgO system \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUsing the data from the dilatometric experiments, it is possible to calculate the apparent activation \n\nenergy and the kinetic exponent, characteristics of the densification mechanism involved in the \n\nsintering. The equation used, Eq. IV.3, for the calculation of the apparent activation energies and \n\nsintering exponent was proposed by Venkatu [18], valid for the initial sintering stage y ? 2 %: \n\n              \n? ?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ???\n?\n\nRT\n\nQQA\ny\n\np\nexp\n\n?\n                   (Eq.

The application of this equation is limited to a range of shrinkage (y ? \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5-SiO2-MgO system \n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\n2 %) into the initial stage. The determination of p is performed through a graph of ln y in function of \n\nln ?, for constant values of temperature, where the slope is equal to -1/p. The value gotten of p = 1.3 \n\nand 1.2, for G3 and G6, respectively, are approximately p ? 1, which corresponds to viscous flow. \n\nEquivalent average value for the viscosity activation energy, Es, of 521\u00b16 kJ mol-1 and 511\u00b124 kJ \n\nmol-1 were found for glass particle size of 3.5 \u00b5m and 6.8 \u00b5m respectively.  \n\nTable IV.1.

The final density of the compacts was not \n\nsignificantly affected at the heating rates of 5 and 10 \u00baC min-1, but at high heating rates, ? >10 \u00baC \n\nmin-1, the density tends to decrease with increasing the heating rate, due to the reported shift of the \n\nshrinkage curves to higher temperatures, Fig. IV.5. For lower heating rates the shrinkage stops earlier \n\ndo to the onset of crystallization. A densification of 97 % and 89 % was obtained for G3 and G6, \n\nrespectively, for the compacts sintered at 10 \u00baC min-1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5 -SiO2 \u2013MgO system \n\n \n\n72 \n\n \n\nShrinkage anisotropy can be quantified by the shrinkage anisotropy factor (k). Equation IV.2 \n\ndescribes a form to calculate the coefficient of anisotropy [11]. \n\nA value equal to 1 or near indicates isotropy. The more moved away from the coefficient value of 1, \n\nthe biggest anisotropy will be.  \n\nAs indicated by the K values, in Fig. IV.7, the shrinkage anisotropy increases with the heating rate, \n\n?, for both compacts and is higher for the coarser powder compacts, G6.   \n\n  \n\n \n\nThe variation of the shrinkage anisotropy factor (k) with the temperature performed at 10 \u00baC min-1 in \n\nthe dilatometer is presented in Fig. IV.8, together with free sintered samples, without the dilatometric \n\nload. It was observed that x- shrinkage was always higher than the y- shrinkage.  \n\nIn the dilatometer samples the k values for G3 compacts are lower than that for G6, and the shrinkage \n\nanisotropy factor decreases to a value near 1, i.e., the sintering becomes 'more isotropic' in nature, \n\nand therefore, the creep strain, according to Eq. IV.2, decreases. The shrinkage anisotropy factor \n\ndecreases continuously during sintering and reaches a value close to 2.5 and 1.2 at 850 \u00baC for G6D \n\nand G3D respectively. In the early stages of sintering, the relative x-axes shrinkage was higher as \n\nmuch as three and two times that of y-axes shrinkage, for G6D and G3D respectively.   \n\nIt is possible that with the sintering process, the neck length grows in the direction of the longer axis \n\nat a faster rate, resulting in the reduction of shrinkage in this direction and consequently of the \n\nanisotropy.  \n\nThe shrinkage of the free sintered samples is nearly isotropic for G3, however, anisotropic shrinkage \n\nfor G6 samples is observed (k~1.5). Without the applied load of the dilatometer, free sintering, the \n\nanisotropy factor k is smaller and  seems to remain nearly constant throughout sintering, in agreement \n\nwith the literature on glass compacts [13].  \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5-SiO2-MgO system \n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThese results are consistent with the literature result, elongated particles or pores lead to anisotropic \n\nshrinkage and the shrinkage is larger in the direction perpendicular to the shaping pressure. \n\nAnisotropic shrinkage is believed to come from green particle preferential orientation. The conditions \n\nfor such can be found in uniaxial pressed compacts of irregular particles, which is here the case. If \n\nparticles are oriented in the x- direction, the initial shrinkage rate will be higher in this direction \n\nbecause of the higher necks per unit length. However, as sintering progresses, the neck length grows \n\nat a faster rate. This results in the reduction of shrinkage in this direction and consequent reduction \n\nof shrinkage anisotropy as sintering progresses, because the rate of particle coalescence is a strong \n\nfunction of neck length. This can explain the reduction of shrinkage anisotropy in the final sintering \n\nstages, though the microstructure still has some anisotropy. \n\nConsidering that when applying a mechanical load, the degree of shrinkage anisotropy mentioned \n\nabove was seen to increase, the main differences between G3 and G6 powder sintering may come \n\nfrom the particle size distribution, since other factors affecting shrinkage anisotropy, as pressing \n\npressure, packing density, dilatometer stress and sintering cycles, are equivalent. It seems probable \n\nthat finer particles can be packed with less preferential orientation, as shown for G3F and G6F \n\nsamples.  \n\nWhen in presence of dilatometric load, Boccaccini and Olevsky [9], show that if the effective stress \n\ndue to the dilatometer load is kept below 5 KPa, the shrinkage anisotropic factor will be nearly \n\nconstant with the progress of sintering, confirming the free shrinkage results. \n\nAnisotropy in densification occurs normally in uniaxial pressed samples, where a higher shrinkage \n\nin the radial direction (for cylindrical samples) is observed as in the case of cordierite type glass \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5 -SiO2 \u2013MgO system \n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\npowder [19] and on non-spherical [20] and spherical [21] borosilicate powder glass, although, on \n\nsoda-lime glass [22] it was observed a higher contraction in the axial direction.  \n\n Micrographs analysis of the anisotropy \n\nTo verify this matter and its relation to the compact densification, micrographs obtained from the \n\ncompact impregnated with resin are present on Fig. IV.9. The x-plane (perpendicular the pressing \n\ndirection) and y-plane (parallel to the pressing direction) were examined.  \n\nThe particles, in the x- direction, in both systems, have their longer axes oriented, especially for the \n\nlarger particle size system, as is revealed in the micrographs, Fig. IV.10. The shorter axes were \n\nobserved in the y- direction.  \n\nMicrographs in Fig. IV. 10 revealed that the particles are of irregular shape and not equiaxed. When \n\nassimilated to two-dimensional (2D) ellipses, as present in Fig. IV.2, their median aspect ratio \n\n(defined as the major axis divided by the minor axis) was, for green samples, 1.63 and 1.67 for y- \n\nand 1.91 and 2.40 on x- direction, for G3 and G6 series respectively, table IV.1. This feature is \n\nimportant, as this intrinsic particle anisometry can lead to microstructural anisotropy in the sintered \n\nbody if particles are aligned during the manufacturing process, which lead to the anisotropic \n\nshrinkage, evidenced by G6 experimental data in Fig. IV.10.  \n\nIn the G3 particle distribution, with more isometric particles, no specific orientation was observed, \n\nthe green glass powder was more uniform, leading finally, to a lower shrinkage anisotropy.  \n\nIt can also be seen that the degree of particle orientation increased with temperature for both G3 and \n\nG6, probably due to the dilatometric process load, in the y- direction, that led to a significant increase \n\nof the necks per unit length in this direction and consequent coalescence of particles. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5-SiO2-MgO system \n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\n Green 760 \u00baC 780 \u00baC \nG\n\n3\nx\n \n\n   \n\nG\n6\n\nx\n \n\n   \n\nG\n3\n\ny\n \n\n   \n\nG\n6\n\ny\n \n\n   \n\n \n\nThe densification using ImageJ was successfully correlated with the relative density of the samples \n\nusing Eq, IV.1, confirming the suitability of the evaluated images as well as the reliability of the \n\nimage analysis method used.

If the particles are aligned in the x-axes direction the angle is 0\u00ba \n\nor 180\u00ba, an angle of 90\u00ba corresponds to the z- direction. In a randomly oriented isotropic material, a \n\nvalue of 0.5 would be expected [13].  \n\nIn order to examine the correlation between particle alignment and shrinkage, the orientation of the \n\nparticles with temperature was determined, Fig. IV.10. For both particle sizes distributions more than \n\n50 % of the particles are oriented in the x- direction. That indicates that a preferred orientation exists. \n\nIn the x-plane, G3 particles were more or less randomly distributed at the beginning but at the end \n\nthey seem to be more aligned along the x-axis, which is the perpendicular to the load direction. In \n\nthe G6 system, particles are mainly oriented along the x-axis. This result shows an important \n\nanisotropy in this plane, certainly induced by the manufacturing process. Fig. IV.10. A preferential \n\norientation is induced, in lower degree in G3 system, leading to anisotropic viscous properties that \n\nshould also affect the particle morphology during sintering. \n\n \n\n \n\nFor the early stages of sintering, the shape of the particles and their nonhomogeneous spatial \n\narrangement in the compact are the major variables affecting the shrinkage behaviour in the green \n\nbody, as a result of the uniaxial pressure used, as seen in Fig. IV.1. The difference in the number of \n\nnearest-neighbour contact points along the x- versus y- planes, especially for G6, with a preferred \n\nspatial distribution, increases the area and number of particle\u2019s contacts site, consequently inducing \n\nan increase in shrinkage anisotropy. \n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\ngreen 760 \u00baC 780 \u00baC\n\nF\nr\na\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n o\nf \n\no\nr\nie\n\nn\nte\n\nd\n p\n\na\nr\nti\n\nc\nle\n\ns \n(%\n\n)\n\nSintering temperature\n\nG3 G6\n\n\n\nIV-Effect of particle size in the anisotropic sintering of the 3CaO.P2O5-SiO2-MgO system \n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nThe results clearly demonstrates the influence of the particle size distribution and, in addition, of the \n\npowder preparation and sintering on the degree of particle orientation and consequent densification \n\nof the final samples. The results suggested that changing the microstructure of the green body, by \n\nvarying the morphology and size of the starting powders used, should lead to a change in the degree \n\nof shrinkage anisotropy, thus transforming the shrinkage behaviour from anisotropic to isotropic. \n\nIV.4.  Conclusion \n\nThe sintering behavior for 3CaO.P2O5-MgO-SiO2 system glass was investigated. The glass powder \n\ncompacts can be densified at the sintering temperature below 800 \u00baC through viscous sintering, \n\nwithout the present of crystalline phases. Significant effect of the heating rate is observed on the \n\nrelative rates of densification and crystallization. Increasing the heating rate leads to higher \nanisotropic shrinkage, for the same temperature, before the optimum temperature of sintering. Near \nfull densification before crystallization was reached by a small decrease of the glass particle size \n\nfrom 6.8 ?m to 3.5 ?m. Comparing the effect of particle size in the particle orientation, a distinctive \n\ninterrelation can be found between the degree of orientation and particle shape. Coarser powders \n\ncompacts exhibited a higher degree of particle orientation, perpendicular to the shaping force \n\ndirection, as those from finer powders. \n\nReferences \n\n[1] M.O. Prado, E.D.

It was found that the crystallization process \n\nwas affected by the fraction of crystallization (x), giving rise to decreasing activation energy values, \n\nEc(x), with the increase of x. Values ranging from about 580 kJ mol-1 for the lower crystallized \n\nvolume fraction to about 480 kJ mol-1 for volume fractions higher than 80 % were found. The Avrami \n\nexponents, calculated for the crystallization process at a constant heating rate of 10 \u00baC min-1, \n\nincreased with the crystallized fraction, from 1.6 to 2, indicating that the number of nucleant sites is \n\ntemperature dependent and that crystals grow as near needle-like structures. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n\nThese chapter is based on the following publication: \n\nE.J.C.

Introduction \n\nThe biocompatibility of many calcium-phosphate glasses and their controllable solubility in \n\nphysiological fluids make them attractive candidates for biomedical applications [1\u20133].  A sensible \n\nway to control degradation of glasses is to promote the in-situ crystallization of adequate crystalline \n\nphases towards the production of a glass ceramic. The nature and relative amounts of crystalline \n\nphases and remaining glassy matrix determine the type of dissolution products and influence the \n\nresponse of these glasses when facing biological systems [4]. Crystallization of glasses depends on \n\ncomposition [5\u201314] but it is mostly affected by the time-temperature programs used in the \n\ndevelopment of the in-situ crystalline phases. Understanding the crystallization kinetics of bioactive \n\nglasses is thus of major importance because it will allow the optimization of the processing \n\nparameters and the tailoring of the microstructure that will provide the properties required for each \n\nspecific application.  A number of glasses from the SiO2 ? 3CaO.P2O5 ? MgO system has been studied \n\nby our group  [15\u201317] with confirmed biocompatibility and in vitro bioactivity [16,17]. In some \n\ncompositions the surface reactivity in a synthetic physiological fluid associated with the precipitation \n\nof an apatite-like layer becomes dramatically depressed when crystallizing the glass [18] and this \n\nmay lead to distinct interfacial responses when in contact with living structures. The aim of this work \n\nis to study the crystallization process of the bioactive glass composition 25Si ? 33Ca ? 11P ? 31Mg \n\n(mol. %) by determining relevant parameters, such as activation energy and Avrami exponent, \n\nthrough a non-isothermal method \u2013 differential thermal analysis (DTA). Kissinger [19], Matusita et \n\nal. [20], and Ozawa [21] equations were used to calculate the kinetic parameters and to examine its \n\ndependence on the fraction of crystallization [22]. The apparent activation energy associated with \n\nglass transition was also assessed from Kissinger and Ozawa methods [19,23,24].  \n\nV.2. Materials and Methods \n\nA glass of molar composition 25Si ? 33Ca ? 11P ? 31Mg was produced by the conventional melt \n\nquenching technique. A calcium to phosphorus molar ratio of 3:1, close to the equivalent ratio in the \n\nnatural bone was used. The raw materials consisting of SiO2 (99.9 %, Fluka), CaCO3 (99.9 %, Fluka), \n\nCa(H2PO4)2 (85 %, Fluka)  and MgO (99.9 %, Fluka); were ball-milled in an agate mill jar and melted \n\nin a platinum crucible at 1500 \u00baC, for 2 h in air, and poured into water to obtain a frit. The frit was \n\ndried, ball milled, and sieved to produce particle sizes ? 20 ?m. Viscosity measurements were carried \n\nout in a beam bending viscometer Bahr Thermo analyse VIS 401) using 5 x 5 x 40 mm3 samples and \n\na heating rate of 10 \u00baC min-1. For the crystallization kinetics studies and glass transition analysis, \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n84 \n\n \n\ndifferential thermal analysis (DTA) was performed in a L81Thermobalance-Linseis thermoanalyser, \n\nusing 25 mg powdered samples with Al2O3 powder as reference material and employing heating rates \n\nof 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 \u00b0C min\u20131 in open atmosphere. The instrument was calibrated for the \n\ntemperature range of 30?1300 \u00b0C, using a sample of ?-A12O3 powder alone.  \n\n  The crystalline phases, developed after 2 hours stages at the temperature peaks revealed by DTA, \n\nwere identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a Rigaku \u201cGeigerflex\u201d D/Max- Series C \n\ndiffractometer with CuK? radiation. The microstructure of the crystallized samples was observed by \n\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM), in a Hitachi, Model SU-70 equipment at an accelerating \n\nvoltage of 25 KeV using fracture surfaces under HCl acid attack for 3 seconds, carbon coated before \n\nobservation.  \n\nThe formation of the crystalline phases within the glass was followed by high temperature X-ray \n\ndiffraction (HT-XRD) using a Philips X'Pert diffractometer, model MRD and also Cu-Ka radiation. \n\nData were collected in a continuous scan type from 10\u00ba to 70\u00ba, with a step size of 0.02\u00ba and a counting \n\ntime of 1 s per step. The in-situ analysis was performed on glass powders while being heated in air, \n\neach 10 \u00baC from 770 to 900 \u00baC, using a heating rate of 10 \u00baC min-1 and a dwell time of 45 min per \n\nscan.  \n\nV.3. Results and Discussion \n\nXRD to the obtained glass frit confirmed its amorphous state as shown in Fig. V.1. \n\n \n\nFig. V.1.

All \n\ncurves exhibit an endothermic peak associated to a glass transition (not always obvious in the graphs \n\nbut found with software help from the slope changing in the region 700 ? 730 \u00baC) followed by two \n\ndistinct exothermic crystallization peaks at higher temperatures strongly dependent on the heating \n\nrate. The relevant results concerning the thermal behavior of the glass are depicted in Table V.1. It \n\nis observed that the glass transition temperature increases with the increase in the heating rate, and  \n\nthe crystallization peak temperatures are also shifted towards higher values at faster heating rates \n\n[25]. It should be emphasized here that, although commonly designated by glass transition \n\ntemperature or Tg, the heating rate dependent temperatures corresponding to the endothermic events \n\nin the DTA traces rather refer to fictive temperatures. Tg is defined on the basis of viscosity, i.e., Tg \n\nequals the temperature where viscosity is 1012 Pa.s, independently of the heating rate. To measure \n\nTg from DSC or DTA, the respect of ASTM Standards is required, i.e., the heating rate of 10 \u00baC min-\n\n1. This kind of analysis of the fictive temperature dependence on the heating rate, based on DTA \n\ntraces, is commonly presented in the literature  [26,27] because it can provide valuable insights into \n\nthe understanding of structural relaxation phenomena near the glass transition temperature. In this \n\nstudy we will also adopt the designation Tg for the fictive temperatures associated with the different \n\nheating rates.  \n\n \nFig. V.2.

The results revealed that no detectable \n\ncrystallization was achieved before 800 \u00baC as suggested by the DTA traces and the crystalline phase \n\nassociated to the first peak corresponds to whitlockite, CaMg(PO4)2. The second peak is related to \n\nthe formation of both forsterite and enstatite as minor Mg-silicate phases as shown in Fig. V.3 and \n\nTable V.2.

A semi-quantitative elemental \n\nanalyse by EDS in SEM was performed on the whitlockite and forsterite crystals.

Forsterite started to precipitate at 900 \u00baC being more \n\nevident at 1000 \u00baC, associated with the presence of three peaks at 25.4\u00ba, 59.0\u00ba, and 66.9\u00ba. Comparing \n\nwith the data from the XRD analysis at room temperature, it is shown that both techniques indicate \n\nthe formation of the same crystalline phases, although at different temperatures. This discrepancy is \n\na consequence of the different thermal cycles used in each analysis and different types of samples \n\n(loose powder for the HT-XRD analysis and broken samples previously heated at specific \n\ntemperatures in the other case). \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n89 \n\n \n\n \nFig. V.5.

Glass transition kinetics   \n\nThe study of the glass transition kinetics may be carried out through the analysis of activation energy \n\nvalues for thermal relaxation obtained from the variation of fictive temperatures (here generally \n\ndesignated by Tg)  with the heating rate, ?, using the Kissinger equation and the Moynihan model \n\n[24].  \n\nAccording to Kissinger equation, Eq. V.1, the apparent activation energy associated with the glass \n\ntransition may be deduced from  \n\nconst\nRTg\n\nE\n\nTg\n\ng\n??\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ?\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n2\n\nln\n?\n\n                           (Eq. V.1) \n\nwhere Eg is the activation energy for glass transition and R is the ideal gas constant. A plot of \n\n??(? ??\n2? )  versus 1/Tg should be a straight line, from the slope of which Eg can be determined, as \n\nrepresented in Fig. V.6. The value obtained for Eg is 1105 kJ mol\n-1. \n\nAnother empirical method, suggested by Moynihan et al. [24], to calculate the activation energy for \n\nthe glass transition, Eg, can be expressed according to the Ozawa method [23] by  \n\n? ? const\nRTg\n\nE\ng\n\n??\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ?\n??ln                            (Eq. V.2) \n\nThe difference between Eq.s V.1 and V.2 lies in the first member. Since Tg is ? dependent the straight \n\nlines given by the plot of ln (?/Tg2) versus 1/Tg (Eq. V.3) or by ln ? against 1/Tg (Eq. V.2) may yield \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n90 \n\n \n\ndifferent slopes thus giving different values for Eg. So, the use of Eq. V.2 requires that before \n\nsubmitting the glass to a heating process of rate ?, it must be cooled to well below the glass transition \n\nregion at a rate that should be similar to the heating rate. A plot of ln ? against 1/Tg (Fig. V.6) yields \n\nan approximate straight line with a slope of \u2013Eg/R, corresponding to an activation energy for the \n\nglass transition of 1128 kJ mol-1.  \n\n \nFig. V.6. Plot of ln(?.Tg-2) and ln ? versus 1/Tg for the glass, according to the Kissinger \n\nand the Ozawa methods \n\nBoth methods give very close values for  the activation energy associated with the glass transition, \n\nindicating that the thermal behaviour of the glass on heating was dependent on the heating rate but \n\nnot significantly affected by the previous thermal history, i.e., by the rate at which the glass was \n\ncooled below the glass transition region. \n\nV.3.2. Crystallization kinetics \n\nDTA results were used to calculate relevant kinetic parameters of the glass-crystallization \n\ntransformations, such as the overall crystallization activation energy (Ec) and the order of the reaction \n\nor Avrami exponent (n). The analysis was focused on the first exothermic peak. Three different \n\nequations were used, namely, Kissinger [19], Matusita et al. [28,29] and Ozawa [30]. In all of them, \n\nit is assumed that the variation of the peak crystallization temperature, Tp, is directly related to the \n\nheating rate, ?, and that the glass composition does not change as crystallization takes place [14]. \n\nAlthough the first criterion seems to be not questionable, the second condition is difficult to fulfill \n\nsince composition of the glassy matrix is changing as crystalline phases form. Despite these \n\nlimitations the proposed analysis is usually accepted because it gives an important contribution for \n\nthe understanding of crystal nucleation and growth in glass systems. From the Kissinger method, the \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n91 \n\n \n\nactivation energy for crystallization, Ec, is determined using Eq. V.3 equivalent to Eq. V.1 for the \n\nglass transition activation energy, Eg \n\nconst\nRTp\n\nEc\n\nTp\n????\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n2\n\nln\n?\n\n                         (Eq. V.3) \n\nwhere Tp is the crystallization peak temperature at the maximum of crystallization peak and ? is the \n\nDTA heating rate. A plot of ln (?/Tp2) vs. 1/Tp should be a straight line, from the slope of which Ec \n\ncan be determined. This equation assumes that the crystal growth occurs on a fixed number of nuclei \n\nthat does not change during heating in the DTA measurements. If the number of nuclei continuously \n\nvaries while heating the samples, the obtained values for Ec may be incorrect. For this case a \n\nmodified Kissinger equation has been proposed by Matusita et al. [29].  \n\nconst\nRTp\n\nEc\nm\n\nTp\n\nn\n\n????\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n2\n\nln\n?\n\n                     (Eq.

The values of n and m for various crystallization mechanisms are shown in Table \n\nV.2. The value m = 1 is considered for one-dimensional growth of crystals or for surface \n\ncrystallization and m = 3 for three-dimensional growth when the crystallization is predominantly \n\nbulk. When the number of nuclei is constant during DTA runs at different heating rates, m = n but \n\nwhen nucleation occurs during DTA, m = n - 1, being the number of nuclei in the glass inversely \n\nproportional to ?. In addition, m = n = 1 for the particular case of surface crystallization. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n92 \n\n \n\nTable V. 3.

[29] for non-isothermal crystallization: \n\n? ?? ?\nRT\n\nEcnx )1(052.11lnln ????                     (Eq. V.5) \n\nwhere x is the fraction of crystallized glass, as given by the partial area of the crystallization peak, \n\nobtained at a fixed temperature from the DTA plot for the heating rate ?. For the various heating rates \n\n(2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 \u00baC min-1) typical sigmoidal curves are obtained (Fig. V. 7a) for the fraction \n\nof crystallization, x, versus temperature. At high temperatures, or in cases where crystallization \n\nfractions are large, a nonlinear behaviour is seen for all heating rates. This nonlinear character can \n\nbe attributed to the saturation of nucleation sites in the final stages of crystallization [32,33]. \n\nAccording to Eq. V.5, the plot of ln[-ln(1-x)] versus 1/T for each heating rate should be a straight \n\nline [32] of slope (n-1)Ec/R. In Fig. V.7, the obtained trends are non-linear independently of the \n\nheating rates. This suggests that i) the crystallization mechanism changes with the heating rate (with \n\nthe number of nuclei most probably varying during heating) and ii) during each DTA run performed \n\nat a given heating rate, the crystal growth mechanism depends on the volume fraction of crystallized \n\nglass (related with temperature as depicted in Fig. V.7 a. Under a practical point of view, this means \n\nthat the activation energy, Ec, and the Avrami parameter, n, should vary during the non-isothermal \n\ncrystallization process of the glass which is further investigated in this work.  \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n93 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. V.7.

Local activation energy \n\nIn the present case, as in few other glass systems, the activation energy for crystallization was seen \n\nto be dependent on the fraction of crystallization [34,35]. The value of the activation energy should \n\nthus reflect the variation of the crystal nucleation and growth mechanism with the volume fraction \n\nof crystallized glass. For these cases, the activation energy associated to a crystallization fraction x, \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n94 \n\n \n\nEc(x), is referred as a local activation energy [36] and it can be obtained from the method introduced \n\nby Ozawa [23], which is based on Eq. V.2, now written as:  \n\n? ?\nconst\n\nRT\n\nEc\n\nx\n\nx\n?\n\n?\n??ln                             (Eq. V.6) \n\nwhere Tx is the temperature corresponding to a fixed value of the crystallized fraction, x, at a given \n\n?. Using the data in Fig. V. 7 b, at a fixed value of the crystallized fraction, x, the value of Ec(x), can \n\nbe deduced from the slope of ln (?) plotted against 1/Tx .This process can be repeated for various \n\ndegrees of conversion, allowing to obtaining the Ec(x) values as a function of x. If the crystallization \n\nenergy Ec(x) is not significantly different for various crystallized fractions x, the existence of a single-\n\nstep reaction can be concluded. In contrast, different values of Ec(x) with x may indicate a complex \n\nnon-isothermal crystallization process  [34].  \n\nFig. V. 8 represents the Ec(x) versus x dependence, showing that the crystallization fraction has a \n\nsignificant influence on Ec(x), decreasing as x increases. At the initial stages of crystallization of the \n\nglass, for example x = 0.1 Ec is 581 \u00b1 10 kJ mol-1 and in the range of x = 0.2?0.7, Ec(x) decreases \n\nrapidly to about 495 \u00b1 13 kJ mol-1. Beyond this point, the decrease of Ec(x) is rather slow, reaching a \n\nquasi-constant value of 482 \u00b1 14 kJ mol-1 for crystallization fractions higher than 0.8.  \n\n \nFig. V.8. Dependence of Ec(x) on the crystallization fraction \n\nThe apparent activation energy values found in this work are in fact close to those obtained for other \n\nbioactive glasses [37, 38] from systems similar to the one studied in this work. A value of 447 kJ \n\nmol-1 was found by Yu et al. [39] for the crystallization activation energy in a 32CaO?18P2O5?\n\n35SiO2?10MgO?5Al2O3 (wt. %) glass composition. For a AW glass-ceramic composition the \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n95 \n\n \n\nactivation energy of apatite crystallization has been reported as 514 \u00b1 57 and 482 \u00b1 36 kJ mol-1, for \n\ncoarse and fine particles respectively [38]. In the commercial bioactive glass, 45S5, the \n\ncrystallization of Na2CaSi2O6, in fine or in coarse powder, was associated with activation energy \n\nvalues of 338 to 230 kJ mol-1, respectively [37]. Although in most literature, activation energy for \n\ncrystallization is usually compared to activation energy for viscous flow, E?, there is no consensus \n\nin this matter [40,41]. As discussed by Fokin et al [42] the similarity between both values is just an \n\nindication that the thermal processes involved are associated with analogous molecular motions, even \n\nwhen considered in different temperature ranges. In fact, this was observed in some glass systems \n\nand compositions such as SiO2?Li2O [29]  but for the 45S5 bioactive glass such similarity was not \n\nfound [43,44]. \n\n For the present glass composition the dependence of viscosity from temperature in the range 710 ?\n\n750 \u00baC is described in Fig. V.10 by the Arrhenian dependence  \n\n???? = ????0 +\n??\n\n2.3??\n                      (Eq.

The temperature dependence of ? may be described by fitting the Vogel \n\nFulcher Tammann  (VFT) equation [45],  \n\nlog ?=A+B/(T-T0)                                        (Eq. V.8) \n\nwhere A, B and T0 are constants that depend on the glass composition, and T is the temperature in \n\ndegrees centigrade. Fitting the experimental data by the least squares method one obtains the values \n\nA = -11.85, B = 5902.29 and T0 = 463.31 in the viscosity range between 10\n9 and 1012.  \n\nFigure 10 represents a tentative viscosity?temperature curve based on the VFT equation, Eq. V.8, \n\ndescribed for the fitting parameters found. Together with the depicted experimental viscosity data, it \n\nis emphasized the region corresponding to the crystallization events, i.e., from 825 to 898 \u00baC as \n\nindicated in Table V.1, for the heating rate of 10 \u00baC min-1.  \n\n \nFig. V.10. Theoretical viscosity-temperature curve based on the VFT equation in the range \n\n1012 - 102 Pa.s. Depicted experimental data were obtained by a beam bending viscometer \n\nin the range of 1012 - 109 Pa.s. Crosses indicate the range of viscosity-temperature where \n\ncrystallization takes place \n\nA key question is to know which structural units control crystallization and viscous flow. Being both \n\nphenomena controlled by diffusion it should be relevant to have a clear indication on 1) the size and \n\nnature of the diffusing building species and 2) the diffusion coefficients of those species in the glass-\n\nforming liquid [41].  In a Si?Ca?P?Mg glass, any of the cations and the anion O2- may behave as \n\nmigrating species. Diameters of all these species are well documented, but diffusion data are scarcely \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n97 \n\n \n\nfound in the literature. In the particular case of Ca2+ and Mg2+, it is generally accepted that these ions \n\ndiffuse faster than Si4+ and O2-, but this conclusion is inferred by analogy among silicate glasses. In \n\nour study, the activation energy for viscous flow E? in the range 109?1012 Pa.s (i.e., 710 ? 750 \u00baC) is \n\n1700 kJ mol-1 and the apparent activation energy for crystallizations lies in the range 480 ? 580 kJ \n\nmol-1 depending on the crystallized volume fraction. This difference indicates that it is likely that the \n\nmigrating species at the temperatures at which the viscosity data was collected are not the same that \n\ndiffuse in the range of temperatures at which crystallization takes place. In fact, larger structural units \n\nsuch as (SiO4)4 \u2013 tetrahedral in different bridging coordination may control viscous flow, and their \n\nhigher diameter could explain the higher viscosity data measured. Information on the ionic bond \n\nstrenghts of cation-oxygen pairs in the glass structure may as well give an additional contribution for \n\nthe understanding of the crystall precipitation within the Si ?Ca?P?Mg system [6]. Based on the ionic \n\nbond strenghts of P ? O and Si ? O which are 465 ? 368 and 443 kJ mol-1 respectively [31,44,46,47], \n\nthe apparent activation energy values obtained in this work suggest that during crystallization a \n\nsignificant amount of the P ? O and Si ? O bonds are being restored towards the formation of \n\nwhitlockite, CaMg(PO4)2, forsterite, Mg2SiO4 and Enstatite, MgSiO3.  \n\nV.3.4. Avrami exponent \n\nTaking into account the calculated local activation energy, the Avrami exponents at a heating rate of \n\n10 \u00baC min-1 were determined using Eq. V.9, [35]    \n\n? ?\n\n? ?? ?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n????\n?\n\nx\nx\n\nx\n\nT\nEc\n\nxR\nn\n\n1ln\n\n1lnln\n                          (Eq. V.9) \n\nwhere n(x) is the local Avrami exponent. In Fig. V. 11 the variation of Avrami exponent, n(x), with the \n\nfraction of crystallization, x, is represented, being clear that it increases from 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 for low x to \n\n2.0 \u00b1 0.1 for high x. The results indicate that as crystallization proceeds, and thus the crystallized \n\nfraction increases, the Avrami exponent increased, corresponding to a crystallization with one-\n\ndimensional growth associated to a bulk nucleation with varying number of nuclei, as suggested by \n\nthe values depicted in Table V.3.  In fact, observation of SEM micrographs in Fig. V. 4 suggests that \n\ncrystals of the primary precipitated phase, whitlockite, appear as long needles in agreement with a \n\npreferential one-dimensional growth. \n\n\n\nV - Crystallization kinetics of a Si-Ca-P-Mg bioactive glass by non-isothermal methods \n\n98 \n\n \n\n \nFig. V.11.

Conclusions \n\nThe crystallization of a 3CaO.P2O5?MgO?SiO2 glass was followed by DTA performed at various \n\nheating rates. Whitlockite, forsterite and enstatite were the crystalline phases forming on heat treating \n\nthe glass. The crystallization of the Si?Ca?P?Mg glass starts with the whitlockite phase, and this \n\nprocess was found to be dependent on the amount of the crystallized fraction. The local activation \n\nenergy values showed to decrease with the increase of the crystallized fraction, from 580 kJ mol-1, \n\nfor low volume fractions, to about 480 kJ mol-1 for volume fractions higher than 80 %. The Avrami \n\nparameter increased with increasing crystallized fraction, from 1.6 to 2, indicating that crystallization \n\nis mostly in volume and occurs with one-dimensional growth, as confirmed by SEM, from a number \n\nof nucleant sites that probably varies during the thermal treatment. \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was financed by FEDER funds through the Operational Programme COMPETE and by \n\nFCT - Foundation for Science and Technology funds under the grant SFRH / BD / 48357 / 2008.

Introduction \n\nThe use of scaffolds plays a key role in the process of regeneration in tissue engineering [1,2]. The \n\nscaffold has to meet certain criteria related to the internal porosity architecture, available surface \n\nand mechanical properties. For bone related purposes the scaffold material should also have a \n\nsuitable rate of degradation and biocompatibility with the bone to be replaced [1\u20134]. Materials such \n\nas metals, polymers, ceramics and composites are commonly used in the manufacture of scaffolds, \n\neach one with their advantages and disadvantages [3]. The use of phosphate glasses as scaffolds \n\ncan be viable, once they have already been used as bioabsorbable implants. A major advantage is \n\ntheir easily adjustable solubility, predictable degradation structure and similar mineral composition \n\nto bone tissue [5]. Bioactive glasses are very interesting as they possess both osseointegration and \n\nosteoconductive properties although their intrinsic mechanical weakness may represent a serious \n\ndisadvantage. This critical point can be optimized by microstructural design using the sintering \n\nvariables [6,7].  Despite the large potential of glass or glass-ceramic scaffolds for bone regeneration \n\napplications, the research in those materials is yet incipient [8\u201310], limiting their application, in \n\ncontrast with the widespread use of ceramic scaffolds, such as hydroxyapatite (HA) [11\u201313] and \n\nrelated calcium phosphates (CaP) (e.g., ?-tricalcium phosphate) [14\u201316]. \n\nVarious methods are commonly used for the preparation of scaffolds with suitable porosity for \n\napplications as tissue engineering templates [17,18], such as foam replica technique [10,12,19\u201321], \n\nincorporation of volatile organic particles [22], sol-gel [23], gel-casting techniques [24,25], and salt \n\nsintering [26], among others. In all the methods to produce 3D structures from glass particles it is \n\nnecessary a sintering step to consolidate the scaffold [8,9,26]. As a result of the relatively high \n\ntemperatures required for sintering [19], the achievement of porous supports with adequate \n\nmechanical resistance and keeping the former glass structure is a challenging task. More and \n\ndeeper research on the processing understanding and control is clearly missing. \n\nAmong the several available methods, the salt sintering process appears as very attractive due to its \n\nversatility and simplicity. The method consists of mixing glass particles with a certain proportion \n\nof soluble salt particles which serves as porogen, such as NaCl, MgSO4 and K2SO4 [27,28]. This \n\nmixture is then compressed and sintered. After sintering, the salt particles are dissolved in water, \n\nleaving interconnected pores in the structure. This technique, initially used in the manufacture of \n\nglass membranes for microfiltration, to remove contaminants from agro-industry, showed the \n\nability to be further applied in the production of materials for various areas of biotechnology and \n\nmedicine. Depending on the ratio glass/salt and particle size distribution, the salt sintering \n\ntechnique allows the preparation of porous materials with large amount of interconnected \n\nmacroporosity, up to 75 vol. % [27,28]. The selected salt must have a suitable particle size, a \n\n\n\nVI. Increased surface area during sintering of calcium phosphate glass and sodium chloride mixtures \n\n \n\n108 \n\n \n\nmelting temperature higher than the temperature needed for the scaffold consolidation and a high \n\nsolubility in a solvent in which the glass is insoluble. The pore size distribution will be dependent \n\non the size distribution of the salt particles. In this work, the sintering of calcium phosphate glass \n\nand sodium chloride powder mixtures to obtain porous glass scaffolds was investigated by \n\nfollowing the salt sintering method. \n\nVI.2.  Material and methods \n\nA 32.68 % CaO ? 10.89 % P2O5 ? 25.43 % SiO2 ? 31 % MgO (mol. %) glass was produced via the \n\nconventional melt quenching technique. The raw materials were ball-milled in agate mill jars and \n\nmelted in a platinum crucible at 1500 \u00baC, for 2 h, in air, and poured into water to obtain a frit. The \n\nfrit was ball milled, and sieved to produce a glass powder with particle size below 20 \u00b5m. Sodium \n\nchloride was used as porogen, supplied by BDH, Middle East LLC, with a purity of 99 %. \n\nThe evaluation of the particle size distribution of the glass was made by laser diffraction in a \n\nCoulter LS 230 Particle Size Analyser, Fraunhofer optical model, Amherst, MA. The specific \n\nsurface areas of the glass powder and salt were determined by physical adsorption of nitrogen gas, \n\nusing the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) method. For those tests, a Quantachrome Quantasorb \n\nequipment, Germany, was used, and before determining the volume of adsorbed gas, powders were \n\nkept under vacuum at 200 \u00b0C, for 4 h. The real density of the glass powder was evaluated by a \n\nhelium pycnometer model Accupyc 1330-Micrometrics.USA. \n\nThe microstructures of the glass and salt powders were characterized by scanning electron \n\nmicroscopy (SEM), in Hitachi, Model SU-70, Germany. For the observation of glass powders, a \n\npowder suspension (0.1g/10ml 2-propanol) was prepared and deposited on an aluminium sample \n\nholder. For the observation of powdered sodium chloride, the salt was deposited in a double-\n\nadhesive tape face of carbon. All samples were coated with a carbon thin film by deposition in an \n\nEMITECH K950 device.  \n\nMixtures of glass and salt in varied proportions, from 10 up to 90 wt. % NaCl, were prepared by \n\nmechanical mixing, during 15 min, in a turbula shaker-mixer, from Glen Mils, USA. The mixtures \n\nwere designated in accordance to the amount of salt, as presented in Table V.1. The theoretical \n\ndensity of the glass: salt mixtures was calculated by the mixture rule, taking into account the \n\ndetermined real density of the glass powder, and the sodium chloride density indicated by the \n\nsupplier. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the glass, salt and mixtures were performed in a \n\nLabsys Setaram TG-DTA, France, using 25 mg powdered samples, Al2O3 powder as a reference \n\nmaterial, and a heating rate of 5 \u00baC min?1, from 25 to 900 \u00baC. Cylindrical green bodies (10 mm \n\ndiameter and 10 mm thick) of the glass/salt mixtures were shaped by uniaxial pressing at 175 MPa, \n\n\n\nVI.

The green density for the GS50 compacts was geometrically determined to be 1.64 g \n\ncm?3.  \n\nTable VI. 1.

The sintered samples were leached in a water bath, at 30 \n\n\u00b0C, for 3 days, to remove the salt fraction and produce a structure with interconnected pores. The \n\nmicrostructure of the obtained scaffolds was observed by SEM and the specific surface area was \n\ndetermined by BET with the above refereed equipment.  \n\nThe apparent density of scaffolds with high enough consolidation to maintain the structural \n\nintegrity after immersion in water was calculated by the geometric measurement of the apparent \n\nvolume. The correspondent porosity was calculated considering the measured value of 2.65 g cm?3 \n\nfor the glass real density. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were \n\ncollected using a Bruker IFS 28 EQuinox spectrometer, Germany, in transmittance mode in the \n\nmid-IR region (4000 \u2013 650 cm?1). Room temperature XRD analysis (Rigaku D/Max-B, Cu K?, \n\nJapan) was also conducted to investigate the possible crystallinity of the fabricated glass powder \n\nand scaffolds.  \n\n\n\nVI.

Characterization of the glass and salt powders \n\nThe glass powders, after crushing and sieving, Fig. VI.1a, are predominantly composed of \n\nangular particles with irregular shape. The glass particles have a wide size distribution, ranging \n\nfrom ~0.04 to 20 \u00b5m and average particle size, D50 = 6.8 \u00b5m, as determined by laser diffraction. A \n\nvalue of 0.8 m2.g-1 was found for the specific surface area, Table VI.2.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. VI.1. SEM micrographs of the glass (a) and salt particles (b) \n\nFig. VI.2 shows the DTA curve for the glass powder obtained at a heating rate of 5 \u00baC min-1. It can \n\nbe observed in Fig. VI.2a, for the glass powder, an endothermic deflection in the temperature range \n\nof 706 \u2013 726 \u00baC, which corresponds to the glass transition region, with an average value at 716 \u00baC. \n\nLater, an exothermic phenomena starting near 817 \u00baC is observed, with two peaks at 837 and \n\n903 \u00b0C in the curve of Fig. VI.2a. These exothermic peaks are associated with the complex \n\ncrystallization phenomena of this glass, occurring in two stages, as reported in another study [29]. \n\nThose and other characteristics of the glass powder are summarized in Table VI.2.  \n\n \n\n\n\nVI.

Thermal Behaviour of the Glass and Salt Mixtures \n\nIt can be observed in Fig. VI.2c, that the endothermic deflection, corresponding to the glass \n\ntransition region, shifts to a lower temperature range, 675-705 \u00baC, average 690 \u00baC in Table VI.2. \n\nThe onset temperature of crystallization, ~795 \u00baC occurred also at lower temperatures when \n\ncompared with the glass curve in Fig. VI.2a and the respective temperature in Table VI.2. The \n\nanticipation of both phenomena, glass transition and crystallization, suggests that the glass structure \n\nis probably affected by the presence of the salt. \n\nThe hastening of the glass crystallization in the presence of salt was confirmed by the XRD \n\nspectra of a mixture GS50, after sintering at 5 \u00baC min-1 up to 760 \u00baC and 800 \u00baC and leaching, when \n\ncompared with the XRD of the glass powders submitted to sintering up to 800 \u00baC, in Fig. VI.3. It \n\ncan be observed that the glass presents an amorphous structure up to 800 \u00baC, whereas the peaks \n\ncorresponding to the calcium phosphate crystallization, although incipient at 760 \u00baC become \n\ndefined at 800 \u00baC in the spectrum of the glass after heated with the salt.  \n\n\n\nVI.

Diffractogram of the glass, G, after heating until 800 \u00baC and of the mixture \n\nGS50 after sintering up to 760 and 800 \u00baC and leaching \n\nFig. VI.4 shows the dilatometric curves of glass-salt pressed compacts with different salt \n\ncontents, from 10 until 90 wt. %, heated at 5 \u00b0C.min-1 to a maximum temperature of 800 \u00b0C. For \n\ncomparison, it is also shown in Fig. VI.4a, the dilatometric curves of a glass compact, G, to a \n\nmaximum temperature of 900 \u00baC and another of a salt compact, S. It is observed in Fig. VI.4 that \n\nthe addition of salt increases the thermal expansion of the compacts, as expected by the effect of \n\nthe higher thermal expansion coefficient of the salt, when compared with that of the glass: a linear \n\nthermal expansion coefficient of 8 x 10-6 \u00b0C-1 was determined for the glass in the range of 100 ? \n\n400 \u00b0C, whereas a value of 43 x 10-6 \u00baC-1 ( ~5 times higher) could be calculated for the salt particles \n\ncompact (S) and an intermediate value of 29 x 10-6 \u00b0C-1, Table VI.2, was found for GS50 in Fig. \n\nVI.4. \n\nIn addition, for compacts with salt contents from 30 to 70 wt. % and temperatures in the range of ~ \n\n450 to 720 \u00b0C, the dilatometric curves present a sharp expansion at those temperatures, losing the \n\nquasi-linear behaviour of the characteristic curves for salt or glass compacts. This expansion is not \n\nreported in literature and will be further analysed ahead. It is also observed that the total shrinkage \n\nis progressively decreasing when increasing the level of added salt, suggesting that the salt particles \n\nact as rigid inclusions hindering the glass viscous flow and, consequently, the densification of the \n\ncompact. The glass compact shrinks up to ~ 850 \u00baC with a total amount of shrinkage ~ 14.5 %, \n\nwhereas the glass/salt compacts densify until ~ 780 \u00baC and exhibit much lower shrinkage values: \n\nfor 30 wt. % salt the shrinkage percentage is ~ 4.7 % and above this percentage, from 50 to 70 \n\nwt. % salt, the compacts exhibit even lower shrinkage values of ~ 2 % (the shrinkage values were \n\ncalculated considering the difference between the length of the sample at the maximum expansion \n\n\n\nVI.

Dilatometric analysis of samples with a) 0, 50 and 100 % salt and b), different \n\npercentages of salt at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min-1 \n\nAnother interesting observation is that the shrinkage of the glass in Fig. VI.4a  significantly \n\ndecelerates at temperatures of 820 \u2013 830 \u00baC, a behaviour which, in viscous sintering, is normally \n\nassociated to the sudden decrease of mobility within the glass due to the beginning of the glass \n\ncrystallization [30,31]. With the introduction of salt, shrinkage decelerates earlier, at ~ 790 \u00baC. This \n\nbehaviour is in accordance with the observed hastening of the onset of crystallization shown in the \n\nDTA and XRD results, and is associated to reaction effects between the glass and the salt during \n\n\n\nVI. Increased surface area during sintering of calcium phosphate glass and sodium chloride mixtures \n\n115 \n\n \n\nthe heating stage. Dilatometric analysis is a good tool to detect many thermal reactions upon \n\nheating [32,33]and the above reported expansion can be related to those reaction effects, as well.  \n\nFurther investigation of the expansion phenomena during the sintering of the glass-salt mixtures \n\nwas performed on the GS50 mixture. Table VI.3 shows the linear expansion, ?l/l0, and the \n\ncorresponding specific surface area, SSA, and porosity of the leached porous structures sintered at \n\ndifferent temperatures and holding times. Values for SSA of known glassy porous structures from \n\nother works are not greater than 1.6 m2 g?1 after sintering, typically an order of magnitude below \n\nthe values here reported [34]. The obtained values of SSA are significantly increased up to 700 - \n\n740 \u00baC, Table VI.3 and Fig. VI.5. Above 740 \u00baC, the reduction of the specific surface area indicates \n\nthat the effect of sintering in decreasing the surface area overlaps the effect produced by the \n\npresence of salt during heating. Accordingly, the reduction of SSA is accompanied by shrinkage of \n\nthe sample, Fig. VI.5, and correspondent decrease of porosity, Table VI.3. Despite the limited pore \n\nremoval during sintering of the glass/salt mixtures, well consolidated glass scaffolds can be reached \n\nby sintering at temperatures in the range 700 \u2013 760 \u00baC, as shown in Fig. VI.6, with reported \n\nmechanical resistance compatible with its application in bone tissue engineering [7]. \n\nTable VI. 3.

Shrinkage and specific surface area of supports, after leaching, in function of the \n\nsintering temperature (heating rate of 5 \u00baC min-1) from mixtures with 50 wt. % salt \n\nSEM observation of the fracture surfaces of GS50 compacts sintered at 750 \u00baC, for 10 min, \n\nafter salt leaching, was performed and representative images are shown in Fig. VI.6a-c.  In Fig. \n\nVI.6a it can be observed, the general microstructure of the scaffold presenting a consolidated \n\nporous glass structure with large pores up 500 ?m. These large pores were created by the salt \n\nleaching after sintering. By inspecting the pores surfaces in Fig. VI.6 b and c it can be observed \n\nthat they present high roughness, suggesting again that during the thermal treatment the sodium \n\nchloride reacted with the glass surface, promoting the wrinkling of the surface with the consequent \n\nincrease of the respective area. For comparison, the microstructure of a glass compact, G, also \n\nsintered at 750 \u00baC is presented in Fig. VI.6d and, in this case, a high dense microstructure with \n\nparticles of irregular shape but a smooth surface are observed. \n\n\n\nVI.

Glass/salt reaction \n\nTo study the glass/salt reaction, porous structures GS50 were sintered (i) at 450 \u00baC, where the \n\nabnormal expansion phenomenon becomes significant in Fig. VI.4, and (ii) after the maximum of \n\nexpansion effects, at 760 \u00baC. After leaching, all samples were analysed by FTIR.  For comparison, \n\nit was also analysed the parent glass powder, G, without heat treatment and sintered at 760 \u00baC, \n\nrespectively. The spectra of all the samples are presented in Fig. VI.7 and Table VI.4 summarizes \n\nthe main bands found in those spectra.  \n\nIn the glass without heat-treatment, G, and glass sintered  at 760 \u00baC, the main absorption band at \n\n1000 \u2013 1200 cm?1 corresponds to Si ? O ? Si stretching vibration [35,36]. The bands from 940 to \n\n925 cm-1 are assigned to the Si ? O symmetric stretch (non-bridging oxygen, NBO) with one non- \n\nbridging oxygen per SiO4 tetrahedron (Q\n3 groups) [37\u201339]. The band, centred at 551 cm-1 can be \n\nassigned to the presence of bending modes of PO4 amorphous phosphate.  For the glass sintered at \n\n760 \u00baC, there\u2019s also the band centred at 603 cm-1, attributed to the presence of PO4 groups. The \n\nband seen at 1370 cm-1 in G is attributed to (CO3)\n2- groups present due to the superficial \n\ncarbonation of calcium in atmospheric CO2. By comparing the two spectra of the glass without and \n\nwith heat-treatment at 760 \u00baC, it can be concluded that they are similar and at this temperature the \n\n\n\nVI. Increased surface area during sintering of calcium phosphate glass and sodium chloride mixtures \n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\nglass is essentially amorphous, in agreement with the DTA results, Fig. VI.2a, where the \n\ncrystallization process was identified to start at ~825 \u00baC and the XRD results, in Fig. VI.3, showing \n\nthat the glass doesn\u2019t present phase crystallization up to 800 \u00baC.  \n\nWhen the glass was sintered in the presence of salt, GS50, at 450 \u00baC, the bands are essentially the \n\nsame as observed for the glass, G, before and after sintered, although some peaks at 558 and 605 \n\ncm-1 start to form and are attributed to the formation of an amorphous phosphate phase. However, it \n\nis for the glass sintered in the presence of salt at 760 \u00baC, that a well differentiated spectrum is \n\nobserved, clearly distinct from the one of the glass, G, and also from that of the GS50 at 450 \u00baC. \n\nFirst of all, all the bands are sharper than in the other spectra, indicating a higher degree of \n\nstructural organization, the beginning of crystallization suggested in Fig. VI.3. Additionally, the \n\npeaks attributed to the phosphate phase, at 560 and 606 cm-1, are now well defined and a shoulder \n\nappears at 571 cm-1 which is associated with the asymmetric stretching vibrational mode of \n\nphosphate groups (P ? O ? P) related to the presence of crystalline phosphates in the glasses, in \n\nagreement with the expected first crystallization of a phosphate-based at temperatures close to 760 \n\n\u00baC (DTA and XRD results, Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, Si ? O bands, from 750 \u2013 1100 cm-1 are \n\nnow clearly splitted into sharper bands with peaks in the range 850 \u2013 950 cm-1 corresponded to Si \u2013\n\nO ? 2NBO (non-bridging oxygen) vibrational modes associated with alkali ions in the glass \n\nnetwork and two well-defined bands at 1050 and 1090 cm?1, attributed to the symmetric stretching \n\nmode Si ? O- and to the asymmetric stretching mode Si ? O ? Si, respectively, which are indicative \n\nof disintegration of the glass structure surface in contact with the salt.  \n\n \n\nFig. VI.7.

The \n\ndetection by FTIR of organized phosphate ions and the formation of non-bridging oxygen, incipient \n\nafter sintering at 450 \u00baC but well defined at 760\u00b0 C, and the earlier glass crystallization in the XRD \n\nspectrum, together with the effect of expansion in dilatometric curves are strongly indicative of a \n\ndisruption of the glass structure surface in contact with the salt. The chemical composition of the \n\nglass and porogen used favour the occurrence of a reaction between the glass and the salt, which \n\nextent will be dependent on the salt fraction in the mixture and other processing variables, namely \n\ntemperature and time of heat treatment. This reaction is responsible for the unusual surface \n\nmodifications of the glass particles that gives rise to the exceptional specific surface area of the \n\nobtained porous structures. This is a unique feature, since it was obtained during the sintering heat \n\ntreatment, which commonly occurs with reduction of SSA and not with the significant increase of \n\n\n\nVI. Increased surface area during sintering of calcium phosphate glass and sodium chloride mixtures \n\n \n\n120 \n\n \n\nthat parameter, as here observed. The increase of the SSA was physically correspondent to an \n\nunusual wrinkling of the inner walls of the macropores, as observed in Fig. VI.6.  \n\nBased on the reported results, a reaction involving the vitreous network and the alkaline salt \n\n(alkaline reaction) is proposed which is schematically represented by, Eq. VI.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n           (Eq. VI.1) \n\n \n\n \n\nThis reaction will produce the disruption of the glass structure at the particles surfaces and the \n\nformation of chlorine gas causing the expansion phenomenon observed in the dilatometric curves, \n\nFig. VI.4, and the wrinkling of the surfaces. Additionally, these changes in the glass structure \n\npromote the decrease of the glass transition temperature, Tg, and the anticipation of the \n\norganization of the amorphous structure towards a crystallized one at lower temperatures.  \n\nThis phenomenon of glass-salt reaction is of high technological interest for the production of glass \n\nand glass-ceramic supports for different applications, namely for bone tissue engineering purposes. \n\nThe exceptional surface area available after sintering provides a higher contact with the \n\nsurrounding physiological fluids and cells, creating the required conditions for a sustainable \n\nformation of new bone. Increasing the specific surface area and pore volume of bioactive glass \n\nscaffolds greatly contributes for the acceleration of mineralization  and therefore enhances  its \n\nbioactive behaviour [42].  Studies in this area are a vast field of research to be explored in the \n\nfuture. \n\nVI.4. Conclusion \n\nGlass scaffolds were produced by the salt sintering method, using a mixture of calcium phosphate \n\nglass, 25.42 % SiO2 ? 10.89 % P2O5 ? 32.68 % CaO ? 31 % MgO (mol. %), and NaCl as porogen, \n\nin proportions varying from 10 up to 90 wt. %. The porous supports were obtained by pressing and \n\nsintering the mixture bellow the salt melting point, followed by the leaching of the salt particles in \n\nwater.  \n\nThe sintering behaviour of the glass: salt mixtures was investigated by dilatometric analysis and \n\nshowed an unusual expansion from ~450 \u00baC until ~760 \u00baC in the mixtures of glass and salt, \n\nfollowed by shrinkage at higher temperatures where sintering is prevalent. This expansion is \n\naccompanied by an increase of the scaffolds specific surface area, SSA, during heating up to ~760 \n\n\u00baC, and it was found that the SSA values for the supports made from mixtures with 50 wt. % of salt, \n\n\n\nVI. Increased surface area during sintering of calcium phosphate glass and sodium chloride mixtures \n\n121 \n\n \n\nafter sintering at temperatures between 700 \u2013 750 \u00baC and leaching, are 15 \u2013 50 times higher than \n\nthe corresponding to the glass precursor powder, a very surprising behaviour because it presents the \n\nopposite tendency of a typical sintering process. The microstructural analysis of these supports by \n\nSEM also showed a remarkable wrinkling of the glass particle surfaces. Additionally, results of \n\ndifferential thermal analysis, DTA, of the mixtures and X-ray diffraction, XRD, Fourier-transform \n\ninfrared spectroscopy, FTIR, of supports sintered at different  temperatures showed net alterations \n\nof the glass structure during heating in the presence of salt, with lowering of the glass transition \n\ntemperature, Tg, and anticipation of the glass crystallization phenomena. Based on the reported \n\nresults, a reaction involving the glass network and the alkaline salt is proposed, in which, a \n\nstructural disruption of the glass surfaces takes place, with formation of chlorine gas that causes the \n\nexpansion phenomenon observed in the dilatometric curves. That reaction would be also \n\nresponsible for the increase of the SSA by the wrinkling of the surfaces and for the creation of \n\npreferential crystallization sites at the surface. This phenomenon of salt\u2013glass reaction is of high \n\ntechnological interest for the production of glass based scaffolds for many purposes including bone \n\nrelated biomedical applications where the exceptional surface area available after sintering can \n\nprovide a high contact surface with the surrounding biological system, promoting the sound \n\nintegration of the newly formed bone. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was financed by FEDER funds through the Operational Programme COMPETE and by \n\nFCT - Foundation for Science and Technology funds under the project CICECO - FCOMP-01-\n\n0124-FEDER-037271 (Ref\u00aa.

P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO ? Na2O, with an open interconnected porosity, \n\nfavourable for bone tissue ingrowth, were produced by a salt sintering process. The effect of Na2O \n\nadditions to 3Ca.P ? Si ? Mg glasses, from which scaffolds were produced, have been investigated \n\nwith regard to sintering behaviour, densification and compressive mechanical properties.  \n\nThe introduction of Na2O by substitution of MgO in the glass composition, decreased the glass \n\ntransition (Tg) and the onset of crystallisation (Tc) temperatures of the glass/salt mixtures. The \n\naddition of sodium has enabled the scaffolds (glass/salt mixture) to be treated at a lower temperature. \n\nAn assessment of their sintering window indicate an improvements in the densification of the glass \n\nscaffold struts leading to favourable mechanical properties, important for further applications, \n\nnamely for tissue engineering. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n129 \n\n \n\n Introduction \n\nThe challenge of manufacturing scaffolds from glass particles, is to obtain a good compromise \n\nbetween densification, pore size and interconnectivity and mechanical properties [1\u20134]. It is \n\nimportant to be able to adjust and to control the sintering working range of the glass, to ensure easy \n\nmanufacturing. As a bioactive glass scaffold, its increased specific surface area and pore volume may \n\ngreatly accelerate the kinetics of the deposition process of hydroxyapatite and, therefore, enhance the \n\nbone-forming activity of these glasses [5,6]. There is no agreement as to the ideal specification for \n\nthe pore network of the scaffolds [7,8]. It is widely accepted that the optimal pore size for bone in-\n\ngrowth within a biomaterial scaffold is 200\u2013400 ?m [9] with a minimum pore diameter of at least \n\n100 ?m, interconnected, important for allowing migration and proliferation of osteoblasts and \n\nmesenchyme cells and ultimately tissue formation [10], whereas microporosity (<10 \u00b5m pores) \n\nallows body fluid circulation. \n\nThe salt sintering process method is a common and simple way to produce glass scaffolds [11\u201313]. \n\nThis method implies a heat treatment that can induce a devitrification of the glass, namely in some \n\ncompositions of the 3CaO.P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO system [13]. In the salt sintering process one should \n\nsinter the salt/glass mixture at a relatively low temperature, bellow salt particles fusion and glass \n\ncrystallisation onset. However, sufficient densification by sintering at low temperatures is difficult \n\nand therefore very fragile scaffolds are produced [11].  \n\nThe addition of alkali metal oxides, can be used to sinter at low temperatures yet getting extensive \n\ndensification of the struts and mechanically competent scaffolds [14\u201316].  \n\nIn this work, we investigate the influence of adding Na2O to the glass composition on the sintering \n\nbehaviour of glass/salt mixtures, thermal properties, microstructures and mechanical properties of \n\nthe scaffolds. The relationships between the sintering temperatures, porosity and mechanical \n\nbehaviour evolution of the glass scaffolds with various Na2O contents are also discussed. \n\n Material and methods \n\nVII.2.1. Glass preparation  \n\nFrom a base composition 32.68% CaO ? 10.89% P2O5 ? 25.43% SiO2 ? 31% MgO (mol. %) three \n\nother compositions were investigated with a constant Ca/P molar ratio of 3 and the substitution of \n\nMgO content by Na2O up to 20 %. This was the highest percentage possible, without phase separation. \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n \n\n130 \n\n \n\nThese compositions, presented in Table VII.1, were designated hereafter as G31N0, G29N2, G28N3 \n\nor G25N6 where the number after G means the molar % of MgO and the digit after N refers to the \n\nmol. % of Na2O. The criterion for the choice of these values was the substitution of the initial MgO \n\nmolar percentage, by 5, 10 and 20 % of sodium oxide.  \n\nTable VII.1.

The chemicals used for the preparation of the \n\nglasses were reagent-grade CaCO3, Na2CO3, SiO2 and Ca(H2PO4)2\u00b7H2O. The mixed powders were \n\nmelted for 2 h in a Pt crucible at temperatures in the range of 1550 to 1450 \u00baC (depending on the \n\nsodium content in the composition). Glasses were quenched in water to obtain frits. Then the glass \n\nfrits were dried and milled in an agate mill and sieved to obtain a glass powder with a particle size \n\nsmaller than 20 ?m and a mean size of 3.5 \u00b5m, as determined by the light scattering technique \n\n(Coulter LS 230, Fraunhofer optical model, Amherst, MA).  \n\nVII.2.2. Glass powder characterization  \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the glass powders was performed using a Rigaku Diffractometer \n\nGeigerflex Dmax-C at room temperature with CuK? radiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed \n\nof 0.02\u00ba s-1. The XRD patterns were recorded in the 2? range of 10-60 degree to evaluate the \n\namorphous nature of the as-prepared glasses (Fig. not shown).  \n\nThe true density was measured by helium pycnometry in a model Accupyc 1330-Micrometrics, USA, \n\nequipment. The specific surface area was determined by physical adsorption of nitrogen gas, using \n\nthe Brunauer, Emmettand Teller (BET) method. For these tests, a Quantachrome Quantasorb \n\nequipment, Germany, was used and powders were previously kept under vacuum, at 200 \u00baC, for 4 h.   \n\nDifferential thermal analysis (DTA) of the glasses was performed in a Labsys Setaram, France, using \n\n25 mg powdered samples, at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C min-1, from 25 to 1000 \u00b0C, using Al2O3 powder \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n131 \n\n \n\nas a reference material, to obtain the glass transition temperature, Tg, and the onset of crystallization \n\ntemperature, Tc, of the glasses. \n\nThe thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the powder compact glasses and mixtures was measured \n\nby dilatometry in a Bahr Thermo Analyse DIL 801 L, Germany at 5 \u00baC min-1, using (10 mm diameter \n\nx 10 mm thick) cylindrical samples. \n\nVII.2.3. Structural characterization of the glass  powders  \n\nFourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy spectra were collected using a FTIR, Brucker tensor 27. \n\nFor this purpose, the glass samples were mixed with KBr (ratio 1:10) and pressed into a pellet using \n\na hand press. All spectra were collected over a region of 4000\u2013400 cm?1, with 256 scans and \n\nresolution of 4 cm?1. \n\n29Si MAS-NMR spectra were recorded on a MSL400P Avance Bruker spectrometer, 9.4 T, wide-\n\nbore, Germany, operating at 79.49 MHz, using 7 mm zirconia rotors at a spinning rate of 5 kHz at \n\nroom temperature, with powdered glass samples. The pulse length was 2 \u00b5s and a 60 s delay time \n\nwas used in order to prevent the different relaxation times between glasses. Kaolinite was used as \n\nthe chemical shift reference. \n\nVII.2.4. Glass scaffold preparation  \n\nFollowing the salt sintering method, [13,17], the glass powders with a mean particle size of 3.5 ?m \n\nwere mixed with NaCl salt, with particle sizes between 212-500 \u00b5m, supplied by BDH, Middle East \n\nLLC, with a purity of 99 %. Mixtures of glass and salt with 50 wt. % NaCl, were prepared by \n\nmechanical mixing, during 15 min, in a turbula shaker-mixer, from Glen Mils, USA. Cylindrical \n\ngreen bodies (10 mm diameter and 10 mm thick) of the glass/salt mixtures were shaped by uniaxial \n\npressing with a geometrically initial density of 1.62 \u00b1 0.02 g.cm-3. The thermal expansion coefficient \n\n(TEC) of the glass-salt mixtures was measured by dilatometry at 5 \u00baC min-1, using a Bahr DIL801L \n\ndilatometer, H\u00fcllhorst, Germany. The dilatometry was performed from 25 to 800 \u00baC, to evaluate the \n\neffect of glass composition on the shrinkage of the mixtures. The optimal sintering temperature was \n\ndetermined from the derivative of the dilatometric curve of the glass/salt compacts, when viscous \n\nflow sintering dominates and no undesired structural changes, due to crystallization, is detected. \n\nThe samples were heated up to the optimal sintering temperature, at 5\u00ba C min-1 and held during 10 \n\nmin at these temperatures and then left to cool inside the furnace. The salt was used as a porogen, \n\nremaining unaltered during the entire sintering process, being easily removed by leaching after the \n\nheat treatment. Leaching was performed by immersing the salt glass mixture samples during one day \n\nin water at 30 \u00baC and 175 rpm. This operation was followed by one day drying in a furnace at 100 \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n \n\n132 \n\n \n\n\u00baC, giving rise to a scaffold. These scaffolds, obtained from the mixture of each glass composition \n\nwith the salt porogen, were designated hereafter as GS31N0, GS29N2, GS28N3 or GS25N6 based \n\non the names of the respective glasses. These designation is also used for the glass/salt mixtures. \n\nVII.2.5. Glass scaffolds characterization  \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the crushed scaffolds were performed to confirm the amorphous \n\nnature of the scaffolds.  \n\nThe total porosity was calculated from Eq. VII.1. The apparent density of the scaffolds (? scaffolds) \n\nwas determined from the apparent volume and mass measurements taken on 6 samples and the \n\ndensity of the glass. The porosity P was then calculated by \n\n? = 1 ?\n?????????\n\n??????\n= 1 ? ?????????                               (Eq. VII. 1) \n\nMechanical properties at compression were studied in a Bose/Electro Force 3400 testing machine. \n\nSix cylindrical scaffolds per composition were compressed at a speed of 0.5 mm min-1. Prior to \n\nmechanical testing, the contact surfaces of each sample were ground to produce smooth parallel \n\nsurfaces. The elastic modulus from compression tests was determined from the initial linear region \n\nof the stress\u2013stain curve and the average compressive strength, taken as the highest stress on the \n\nstress\u2013strain curve, for six samples tested. \n\n Results and Discussion \n\nVII.3.1. Glass / salt sintering behaviour  \n\nFig. VII.1 shows the linear shrinkage vs. temperature of the 50 wt. % glass/salt mixtures for a heating \n\nrate of 5 \u00baC min-1. For the GS25N6, GS28N3, and GS29N2 and GS31N0 the shrinkage starts at \n\ntemperatures ~ 630, 648, 652 and 700 \u00baC respectively, as shown in Table VII.2, designated as Ts. \n\nGlass scaffold GS31N0 exhibits the lower densification, while the highest is shown by GS25N6.  \n\nThe thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the mixture compacts with 50 wt. % salt, were \n\ncalculated between 100 ? 400 \u00baC and are summarized in Table VII.2. It is observed that the addition \n\nof the salt as porogen increases the thermal expansion of the compacts, when compared to the \n\ndilatometric behaviour of the base glasses alone, as expected by the effect of the higher thermal \n\nexpansion coefficient of the salt, 43 x 10-6 \u00b0C-1, near 6 times larger than that of the base glasses, as \n\nalready discussed elsewhere [11]. This effect is higher for the GS31N0 composition and decreases \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n133 \n\n \n\nwith the increase of sodium content in the glass composition.

The introduction of Na2O \n\nto the composition of the glasses decreased the Tg and the Tc, Fig. VII.3, and increased the TEC of \n\nthe glass compact powders. \n\nThe derivative of the dilatometric curve, Fig. VII.2, of the GS25N6 shows that the shrinkage starts \n\nnear 630 \u00baC. The shrinkage rate then increases rapidly and steadily up to 712 \u00baC, and then more \n\nslowly up to 722 \u00baC, when it starts to decrease significantly due to the increase of viscosity and \n\nstructural changes due to the onset of crystallization. Dilatometry shrinkage rate results, confirmed \n\nthat the optimum sintering temperature for GS25N6 compacts lies in the interval 712\u2013722 \u00baC. The \n\noptimal sintering temperature was chosen at 720 \u00baC. The same procedure was performed for all \n\ncompositions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n \n\n134 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.VII. 1.

In the absence of the porogen, \n\nDTA analyses of the glass powders, Fig. VII. 3 show that the Tg of the glasses, decrease from 706 \n\nto 635 \u00baC for G31N0 and G25N6 respectively, and the onset of crystallization temperature also \n\ndecreases from 817 to 724 \u00baC. Consequently, the glass working windows (?T = Tc ? Tg) decrease \n\nfrom 111 \u00baC to 89 \u00baC for glasses G31N0 and G25N6 respectively, Table VII.2. As shown in literature, \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n135 \n\n \n\ndevitrification can be avoided and thus the working window enlarged by decreasing the amount of \n\nalkali, or by increasing the amount of alkaline earths [15].  \n\n \n\nFig.VII. 3. DTA curves of the base composition G31N0 and G25N6, at 5 \u00baC min-1 \n\nIt should be emphasised that the main goal of this work is to increase the sintering window of the \n\nglass scaffolds. The salt porogen fusion starts near 795 \u00baC and promotes an earlier crystallization of \n\nthe GS31N0 glass structure, detected at 760 \u00baC as reported in a previous work [13]. In the presence \n\nof the salt porogen, the sintering window decrease from 111 \u00baC, as shown by DTA analysis to ~ 55 \n\n\u00baC, as confirmed by the dilatometry of the scaffold, Fig. VII.1, the lowest sintering window of all \n\nmixtures, as resumed in Table VII.2.  \n\nResults showed that the addition of Na2O was beneficial to the densification of the glass/salt mixture \n\ncompacts, due to the decrease of the onset of densification and increase of sintering window, without \n\nthe presence of crystallization. \n\nVII.3.2. Glass scaffolds characterization  \n\nCylindrical scaffolds were obtained by the salt sintering process and lixiviation of the salt porogen. \n\nSintering of the 50 wt. % salt mixtures was performed near the maximum shrinkage temperature at \n\na velocity of 5 \u00baC min-1. As the densification of the compacts with time occurs especially in the first \n\nminutes, with a drastic decrease of specific surface area values, as studied before [13], samples were \n\nheld for 10 min at the maximum selected temperature. The sintering conditions are presented in table \n\nVII.3.  \n\nFrom Table VII.3 it is observed that with the addition of sodium oxide, to the base glass composition, \n\nand a reduction of 50 \u00baC (GS29N2) to 30 \u00baC (GS28N3 or GS25N6) from the initial sintering treatment, \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n \n\n136 \n\n \n\n(750 \u00baC  for GS31N0), the porosity of the scaffolds decreased from 65.5 % for GS31N0 to 60.8 % \n\nGS25N6.  \n\nThe compressive strength increased from 1.3 (GS31N0) to 1.4, 1.7 and 1.8MPa for the GS29N2, \n\nGS28N3 and GS25N6 scaffolds respectively, as summarized in table VII.3.  \n\nTable VII.3.

As the content of sodium in the glass composition increases, the \n\nsurface area of the correspondent scaffolds decrease.  \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n137 \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.VII. 4. Effect of sodium content on the S.S.A of the glass powder (before sintering) and \n\ncorresponding scaffolds obtained at the optimum sintering temperature during 10 min at a heating \n\nrate of 5 \u00baC min-1 \n\nAs discussed in a previous work [13], the porogen favour the occurrence of an alkaline reaction \n\nbetween the glass surface particles of G31N0 and the salt, producing the expansion phenomenon \n\nobserved in the dilatometric curves, Fig. VII.1 and the increase of the specific surface area of the \n\nobtained porous structures, Fig. VII.4. These results show that the effect of sodium porogen on the \n\nglass surface becomes less evident with the increase of sodium content in the glass.  \n\nTo understand this observation, transmittance FTIR spectroscopy was performed on the as-prepared \n\nG31N0 and G25N6 glasses, and corresponding glass scaffolds, being the obtained spectra shown in \n\nFig. VII.5. FTIR spectra of both glasses, reveals a main absorption band at 1000 \u2013 1200 cm-1 \n\ncorresponding to Si ? O ? Si stretching vibration and a shoulder at 890-960 cm-1 assigned to Si \u2013 O \n\nsymmetric stretch (non-bridging oxygen, NBO). Another peak was observed at 455 \u2013 476 cm-1 which \n\nis due to Si ? O ? Si bending vibration. The peaks at 560 cm-1 in the P \u2013 O \u2013 P bending mode, suggest \n\nthe presence of an amorphous calcium phosphate phase, confirmed by XRD (Fig. not shown) [20\u2013\n\n23].  \n\nAfter the contact with the salt, the peak attributed to the phosphate phase, split in two, at 557 and 600 \n\ncm?1, for both compositions, due to the formation of a phosphate phase, still amorphous. The \n\nGS31N0 spectra is more affected, in the presence of salt, Fig. VII.5b. To the shoulder associated to \n\nSi \u2013 O stretch, with one non-bridging oxygen (Si \u2013 O \u2013 NBO), a new is added, near 850 cm?1 assigned \n\nto the Si \u2013 O(s) with two non-bridging oxygen per SiO4 tetrahedron (Si \u2013 O \u2013 2NBO), also called \n\nQ2 groups associated with alkali ions in the glass network, which are indicative of disintegration of \n\nthe glass structure in contact with the salt [24,25]. \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n \n\n138 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig.VII. 5. FTIR data of the as-prepared glasses and corresponding scaffolds a) G25N6 and \n\nGS25N6 and b) G31N0 and GS31N0. \n\nMAS-NMR results of the 29Si spectra are presented in Fig. VII. 6. The centre of Q2 peak shifted from \n\n-80.9 ppm for the base glass to -82.1 ppm for the glass with 6 % Na2O, thus suggesting a slight \n\ndecrease polymerization of the silicate glass network. The addition of alkali oxides to the base glass \n\ncomposition, G31N0, modified the network structure by replacing bonding oxygen\u2019s (BO) by non-\n\nbridging oxygen (NBO), thus opening the glass structure.  \n\n \n\nFig.VII. 6. 29Si MAS NMR spectra of some investigated glasses.  \n\nThese results confirm that the salt porogen attack, to the glass structure of the particles surfaces \n\nduring sintering, is more effective when there is no sodium in the glass composition. It is possible \n\nthat the presence of sodium in the composition creates the higher allowable amount of non-bridging \n\noxygens in the glass structure thus reducing the possibility of the porogen NaCl to react with the \n\nglass surface by a salt-glass alkali reaction, as suggested in a previous work [13]. \n\n\n\nVII - Effect of Glass composition on the processing and properties of Ca-P-Mg-Si scaffolds  \n\n139 \n\n \n\n Conclusion \n\nFive scaffolds with different chemical compositions, in the 3CaO.P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO ? Na2O, have \n\nbeen successfully prepared by the salt sintering method, with 60 to 66 % porosity. The scaffolds with \n\nhigher sodium content showed a compressive strength near 2 MPa, close to the minimum value for \n\nnatural trabecular bone.  \n\nThe addition of Na2O to the glass composition increased the sintering ability of the glass scaffolds \n\nwhich led to denser struts with higher mechanical strength. The sintering window for the processing \n\nof the new glass scaffolds, when compared to sodium-free glass scaffolds, increased by 4 \u00baC, 18 \u00b0C \n\nand 37 \u00b0C with 5, 10? and 20 mol. % MgO substitution by Na2O, respectively.  \n\nTherefore, the produced scaffolds can be proposed as effective candidates in the field of bone tissue \n\nregeneration due to their mechanical strength, porosity, SSA and easy tailoring. \n\nReferences \n\n[1] O.

The in vitro bioactivity of the scaffolds was tested by soaking them \n\nin a simulated body fluid (SBF) and by subsequent characterization of the materials surface by SEM, \n\nEDS, and X-ray diffraction and of the immersion fluid by ICP. The replacement of 6 % MgO by \n\nNa2O in the glass network allowed to tailor the dissolution rate and bioactivity of the glass scaffolds \n\nand to obtain significant improvements in the mechanical properties of the scaffolds. \n\nRegarding the biological assessment, the incorporation of sodium to the composition resulted in a \n\npoor cell response for small periods. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that for 21 days the cells on \n\nthe glass containing sodium surface recovered, are in a similar number and differentiated stage \n\ncompared to those growing over non-sodium glass. This shows that the cells exhibit full functionality \n\nafter adaptation to the scaffold containing sodium, which takes a few days. This scaffold does not \n\nnegatively affect osteoblasts proliferation rate as shown by the increasing ALP activity and presence \n\nof mineralized deposits. \n\nThe results showed that scaffolds with different bioactivity and degradation rates can be achieved by \n\nreplacing 6 % of MgO in silicate phosphate bioactive glass with Na2O. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of \n\nCa-P-Mg-Si-Na scaffolds \n\n147 \n\n \n\nVIII.1 Introduction \n\nThere has been an increasing interest in the development of porous structures for bone tissue \n\nengineering applications that allow cells to attach, proliferate, differentiate and organize into healthy \n\nbone tissue as the scaffold degrades [1\u20134]. Great attention has been paid to bioactive glasses, because \n\nthey have the ability to build a strong interface between the material surface and bone tissue, through \n\nthe formation of a carbonated hydroxyapatite layer on their surface [5]. The bioactivity and \n\nbiocompatibility of these bioactive glasses are strongly affected by their degradation rate and \n\nassociated ion release [6\u20138]. Therefore, it is expected that the chemical durability and the dissolution \n\nrates can be tailored by adjusting for example, the oxide composition of the glasses, to suit with their \n\nend application [9\u201314]. Several studies showed that addition of B2O3 to phosphate glasses improved \n\nthere chemical durability [14,15]. Incorporation of boron by replacing Na2O into the P2O5?CaO?\n\nNa2O?MgO?B2O3 glass system showed favourable effects on the cell metabolic activity, \n\nproliferation, and morphology. The ALP activity improved for glasses containing 0 \u2013 5 % B2O3 [14]. \n\nSubstituting Na2O with CaO yielded less degradable glass in the (40-x)Na2O?xCaO?60P2O5 systems \n\n[16]. An increase of the cross-linkage or the introduction of highly insoluble ions, makes the glass \n\nstructure less susceptible to solution attack. Reducing the degradation rate, concomitant with the \n\nreduction in the release rate of certain ions, has led to better biocompatibility [17].  \n\nIn the previous chapter it was reported the effect of Na2O addition on the processing, structure and \n\nsome properties of glasses within the Ca?P?Mg?Si?Na system. Although the incorporation of Na2O \n\nin the CaO?P2O5?SiO2\u2013MgO glass composition was advantageous for the scaffolds production, one \n\nof the main problems associated with high alkali content is its high dissolution rate, when exposed \n\nto a biological fluid and consequent rapid release of soluble ionic species that regulate the cells \n\nresponse [18]. This rapid lixiviation can cause faster bone resorption that may negatively affect the \n\nbalance of natural bone regeneration. Thus compromising the usefulness of the glass behaviour in \n\nvivo [18,19]. \n\nThe aim of this study is focused on the influence of 6 mol. % MgO substitution by Na2O, on the \n\nsurface reactivity, and biocompatibility of similar scaffolds produced by the salt sintering process \n\nfrom glasses of the Si\u2013Ca\u2013P\u2013Mg\u2013Na system. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of Ca-P-Mg-Si-Na \n\nscaffolds \n\n \n\n148 \n\n \n\nVIII.2 Materials and method \n\nVIII.2.1. Glass scaffold preparation \n\nGlass scaffolds designated by GS31N0  and GS25N6  were prepared via salt sintering process, as \n\npreviously described [20]. Cylindrical green bodies (10 x 10 mm2) of mixtures consisting of glass \n\nparticles (average size 3.5 \u00b5m) and 50 wt. % salt particles (212\u2013500 ?m) were shaped by uniaxial \n\npressing with an initial density of 1.60\u00b10.02 g.cm-3. \n\nThe compositions of the glasses are presented in Table VIII.I.  \n\nTable VIII.1. Nominal composition of the glasses (mol. %) \n\n             mol. % \n\nSample \nCaO P2O5 SiO2 MgO Na2O \n\nG31N0 32.68 10.89 25.43 31.00 - \n\nG25N6 32.68 10.89 25.43 24.80 6.20 \n\n \n\nThe cylindrical glass/salt powder compacts were heated in an electric furnace up to 750 \u00baC and 710 \n\n\u00baC for GS31N0 and GS25N6 respectively, at a heating rate of 5 \u00baC min-1 and held during 10 min at \n\nthese temperatures. Samples were left to cool inside the furnace until room temperature. The salt was \n\nremoved by leaching in water bath at 30 \u00baC and 175 rpm, followed by one day drying in a furnace at \n\n100 \u00baC, giving rise to the scaffolds. \n\nVIII.2.2. Glass scaffold characterization  \n\nThe amorphous nature of the glass particles for the scaffolds was confirmed by X-ray diffraction \n\n(XRD) analysis using a Rigaku Diffractometer Geigerflex Dmax-C at room temperature with CuK? \n\nradiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed of 0.02\u00ba s-1. The XRD patterns were recorded in the \n\n2? range of 10\u201360 degree.  \n\nThe specific surface area of the scaffolds was determined by physical adsorption of nitrogen gas, \n\nusing the Brunauer, Emmettand Teller (BET) method. For those tests, a Quantachrome Quantasorb \n\nequipment, Germany was used, small pieces of broken scaffolds were previously kept under vacuum, \n\nat 200 \u00baC, for 4 h.   \n\nFourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy spectra were collected using a Bruker IFS 28 EQuinox \n\nspectrometer, Germany. For this purpose, the glass samples were mixed with KBr (ratio 1:10) and \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of \n\nCa-P-Mg-Si-Na scaffolds \n\n149 \n\n \n\npressed into a pellet using a hand press. Transmission spectra of the KBr pellets were collected over \n\na region of 4000 \u2013 400 cm?1, with 256 scans and resolution of 4 cm?1. \n\nPorosities of the scaffolds were measured by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry, using an AutoPore IV \n\n9500V1.07 serial 734 Penetrometer. Sample weight varied from 0.25 to 0.3 g.  \n\nMechanical properties of the scaffolds at compression were studied in a Bose/Electro Force 3400 \n\ntesting machine. Six cylindrical samples (10 x 10 mm2) were compressed at a speed of 0.5 mm min-\n\n1. Prior to mechanical testing, the contact surfaces of each sample were ground to produce smooth \n\nparallel surfaces. The elastic modulus was determined from the linear region of the stress vs. strain \n\nresponse. \n\nVIII.2.3. Bioactivity in SBF \n\nThe preparation of the SBF was carried out following the procedure proposed by Kokubo [21,22]. In \n\nvitro tests were performed under static conditions soaking the glass scaffolds samples in sealed \n\npolyethylene bottles with SBF solution at 37 \u00baC, with a constant specimen surface area to solution \n\nvolume ratio of 0.1 cm?1, considering the value of the surface area given by the BET method. The \n\nsamples were kept immersed for different periods of time between 1 hour and 21 days at 37 \u00baC. After \n\neach time point, the solution was filtered through a Milipore 0.22 ?m system. The samples were \n\nstudied by XRD, FTIR spectroscopy and SEM. A scanning electron microscope attached with an \n\nenergy dispersive electron probe X-ray analyser (SEM-EDS, Hitachi Su-70, Germany system) was \n\nused to analyse both microstructure of scaffolds before and after immersion into SBF. All samples \n\nwere coated with carbon using an EMITECH K950 device coater, prior to observation.  \n\nThe changes in the concentration of Ca, Si, P and Mg ions in SBF solution were determined by \n\nInductively Coupled Plasma spectroscopy (ICP, Jobin Yvon, JY70 Plus) at different soaking times. \n\nVIII.2.4. Biocompatibility studies \n\nHuman bone marrow, obtained from orthopaedic surgery procedures (after patient informed consent), \n\nwere cultured in in ?-Minimal Essential Medium (?-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine \n\nserum, 100 mg ml-1 penicillin, 10 IU streptomycin, 2.5 mg ml-1 fungizone, at 37 \u00baC in a humidified \n\natmosphere of 5 % CO2 in air. For subculture, phosphate-buffered saline (SBF) was used to wash, \n\ntwice, the cell monolayer and then incubated with a trypsin\u2013EDTA solution (0.05 % trypsin, 0.25 % \n\nEDTA) for 10 min at 37 \u00baC to detach the cells. Material samples were sterilized by autoclaving at \n\n120 \u00baC and the cells were re-suspended in culture medium and seeded (105 cells cm-2) over the \n\nmaterials surface for up to 6 days in the experimental conditions described above.  \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of Ca-P-Mg-Si-Na \n\nscaffolds \n\n \n\n150 \n\n \n\nColonized materials were evaluated at days 7, 14 and 21 for cellular viability/proliferation and \n\nobserved by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM; Leica SP2 AOBS), to evaluate throughout \n\nthe culture time the cell morphology, cell viability/proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity \n\nand ability to form calcium phosphate deposits. Control cultures and seeded material samples were \n\ncultured for 7 and 21 days in the presence of 50 ?g ml-1 ascorbic acid, 10mM ?-glycerophosphate \n\nand 10 nM dexamethasone. This experimental conditions reported to allow the osteoblast \n\ndifferentiation in this culture system [23]. All the experiments were performed in the first subculture, \n\nsince the sequential passage of bone marrow cells results in a progressive loss of the osteoblastic \n\nphenotype [24]. \n\nALP results are expressed in nanomoles of p-nitrophenol produced per min per lg of protein (nmol \n\nmin-1/lg protein). Values are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of three replicates and \n\nwere compared using the student\u2019s t-test, with a significance level of p &lt;0.05. \n\nVIII.3 Results and Discussion \n\nVIII.3.1 Scaffold characterization \n\nSEM micrographs of the scaffolds GS31N0 and GS25N6, Fig. VIII.1, clearly show an interconnected \n\nmacroporosity with smaller pores distributed throughout the structure within larger pores. The two \n\nsamples are quite similar from a macroscopic point of view, as expected, since the size of the \n\nmacropores is controlled by the NaCl particle sizes (250-350 \u00b5m). The macropores with size ranging \n\nfrom 60 to 500 \u00b5m, were 3 dimensionally opened and continuously connected.  \n\n \n\n Representative SEM micrographs of the glass scaffolds samples showing large pores \n\n(larger than 400 \u00b5m) for a) GS31N0 and b) GS25N6  \n\nTo assess the microstructural pore features of the GS31N0 and GS25N6 porous glass samples \n\nmercury porosimetry was performed, providing the total pore volume and the pore size \n\ncharacterization as summarized in Table VIII.2. The pore size smaller than 10 \u00b5m correspond to the \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of \n\nCa-P-Mg-Si-Na scaffolds \n\n151 \n\n \n\nmicropores resulting from the sintering process, increasing the interconnectivity of the porous \n\nstructure.  \n\nMacroporosity volume of the two scaffolds was identical, as expected, since it is a result of the same \n\nsalt content present in the mixture. The larger pores were distributed between 60 and 350 \u00b5m. This \n\npore size was well below the observed in SEM, Fig. VIII.1. The discrepancy between the observed \n\nvalues by microscopy and porosimetry is well known, and is attributed to the fact that porosimetry \n\ntechnique measures the size of the constrictions of the pores, resulting in an underestimate pore size. \n\nThe median pore diameter ~ 90 ?m of the constrictions is near 100 ?m. The diameter of \n\ninterconnecting pores seems to dictate the quality of tissue growing into the pores. Although there \n\nare different views, literature compromise seems to be that the optimal pore size for mineralized bone \n\ningrowth varies between 100 and 400 \u00b5m. \n\nThe resulting porous glass cylinders also showed an open porosity of about 63 % for both GS31N0 \n\nand GS25N6, with about 12 % porosity caused by micropores (&lt;10 \u00b5m). The porosity of the \n\nscaffolds is higher than the theoretical one (45 percent of the pore-foaming agent), which indicated \n\nthat sintering procedure promotes the appearance of some microporosity as shown in the SEM and \n\nmercury porosimetry. The microporosity &lt;10 \u00b5m with a median pore ~2 \u00b5m is also important since \n\nscaffolds involving both micro and macro porosities can perform better than only macro porous \n\nscaffolds [25]. \n\nTable VIII.2.

It should be greater than 100 \u00b5m to allow bone tissue ingrowth \n\nand eventually vascularisation. In this study a median pore diameter near 90 \u00b5m was obtained. \n\nThe main goal of this work was to prepare two similar scaffolds with different composition. By \n\ndecreasing the sintering temperature of 750 \u00baC for the GS31N0 in 40 \u00baC for the GS25N6, it was \n\npossible to produce scaffolds with similar porosity. Nevertheless, the resulting scaffolds presented, \n\na higher strength and elastic modulus for GS25N6, as resumed in Table VIII.3. The compressive \n\nstrength is inside the range of trabecular bone, 0.1\u201316MPa [26] and near the Young\u2019s modulus 0.05\u2013\n\n0.5GPa [27].  \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of Ca-P-Mg-Si-Na \n\nscaffolds \n\n \n\n152 \n\n \n\nTable VIII.3.

The FTIR absorbance spectra for the glass scaffolds, before and \n\nafter immersion into SBF are shown in Fig. VIII.2, for 3 and 7 days immersion.   \n\nBefore soaking, both scaffolds showed intense silicate group absorption bands. The intense bands at \n\n~1020 and ~920 cm-1 are assigned to the Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si asymmetric stretch and Si \u2013 O (NBO) symmetric \n\nstretch respectively. The peaks at ~ 594, 552 and 600 cm-1, correspondent to the P \u2013 O bending, were \n\npresent in both samples. GS25N6 also presented an additional peak at ~459 cm-1 correspondent to \n\nthe Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si bending.  \n\nThe FTIR spectra of the GS31N0, after 3 days of immersion in SBF, showed a decrease in \n\ntransmittance intensity and a split into a weak twin band around 570 and 600 cm?1 which corresponds \n\nto the bending mode of P \u2013 O bonds in the amorphous calcium phosphate [28,29]. After 7 days, \n\nanother set of peaks formed at 1460, 1420 and 870 cm-1, was attributed to the formation of C \u2013 O \n\nbonds [30].  \n\nIn the GS25N6, a behaviour similar to that of GS31N0 was observed at 3 days immersion. After 7 \n\ndays immersion, the peaks related with the presence of calcium phosphate phase 602 and 506 cm-1, \n\nbecame sharper which is related to the presence of apatite crystalline phase [31] as a consequence of \n\nthe reaction with the SBF. CO2 is incorporated from the solution, producing a broad peak near 870 \n\ncm-1. The C \u2013 O bonds (at 1460 and, 1420 cm-1) have undergone peak splitting.  \n\nThe presence of P \u2013 O and C \u2013 O bonds suggests the formation of apatite and indicates the in vitro \n\nSBF bioactivity of the scaffolds [32]. All glasses exhibited the splitter band at 1412 and 1460 cm-1 \n\nand the band at 875 cm-1 which indicate the presence of CO3 groups whereas the bands observed at \n\n1040 \u2013 1050, 602 and 563 cm-1 were assigned to PO4/HPO4 groups (crystalline HCA). The P \u2013 O \n\nbending peak pronunciation indicates the growth of the hydroxyapatite-like layer [33].  \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of \n\nCa-P-Mg-Si-Na scaffolds \n\n153 \n\n \n\n \n\n FTIR data after immersion of the prepared glass scaffolds in SBF for 3 and 7 days; a) \n\nGS31N0  and b) GS25N6   \n\nThe X-Ray diffractographs of the scaffolds after 1 hour, 3, 7 and 14 days immersion in SBF are \n\npresented in Fig. VIII. 3. After 1 hour immersion, both scaffolds are essentially amorphous, with \n\nsome insipient apatitic peaks, observed especially on GS31N0.  \n\nAfter 3 days soaking the diffraction planes (2 1 3), (2 1 1), and (0 0 2), of GS31N0  and GS25N6, \n\ncorresponding to the peaks at 49\u00ba, 32\u00ba, and 26\u00ba respectively, indicate that small apatitic crystals \n\nprecipitate after immersion, Ca5(PO4)3(OH) according to the card No. 01-086-0740, the X\u2019Pert \n\nHighScore database,  confirming the previous FTIR results. Also incipient peaks of whitlockite \n\n(Ca2.859Mg0.411(PO4)2) appear in the GS31N0, at (2 1 4), (0 2 10), (1 2 8) and (2 1 10) corresponding \n\nto the peaks 28\u00ba, 31\u00ba, 33\u00ba and 36\u00ba, according to the card No. 01-087-1582.  \n\nAfter 14 days immersion, both scaffolds presented, together with the apatite phase diffraction planes, \n\nnew diffraction peaks for 13.7\u00ba, 17\u00ba and 58\u00ba assigned to the reflection (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (3 3 9) of \n\nwhitlockite.  It is possible that magnesium is incorporated into the atomic structure of HA and that \n\nHA phase cohabites with whitlockite. The precipitation of these two phases (apatite and whitlockite), \n\nwas also observed in the literature, on the surface of glasses containing Mg when exposed to SBF \n\n[34\u201336]. The increased intensity of the hydroxyapatite peaks with soaking time is indicative of the \n\ngrowth of an apatite layer of enhanced crystallinity.  \n\nBy 14 days, in GS25N6, it was no longer possible to observe the amorphous halo, in the range of 20-\n\n30 degrees, promoted by the presence of an amorphous phase on the sample probably due to the \n\ncompletely covered of the surfaces by the HA layer. The mechanisms of the interaction between both \n\nglass scaffolds compositions and the SBF seem basically the same. In the first 3 days the presence \n\nof HA was higher on GS31N0, although the development of hydroxyapatite seems to slow down on \n\nGS31N0, for longer immersion times. The presence of the amorphous halo is particularly evident \n\neven after 14 days of immersion on the GS31N0 while on GS25N6 it disappears, been covered by \n\nthe crystalline phases present. \n\n \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of Ca-P-Mg-Si-Na \n\nscaffolds \n\n \n\n154 \n\n \n\n \n XRD of the scaffolds after immersion in SBF, for 7 and 14 days for a) GS31N0 and b) \n\nGS25N6  samples \n\nThe surface modifications observed after immersion of the scaffolds in SBF were accompanied with \n\nmicrostructural observation. Fig. VIII.4 shows the SEM micrographs of the surface of the scaffolds \n\nGS31N0 and GS25N6, after soaking in SBF for 3, 7 and 21 days. The macroporous structure for all \n\nscaffolds was intact after soaking, although the surfaces of these scaffolds have presented important \n\nchanges.  Soon after 3 days, some agglomerates formed on the surface of the scaffolds and after 7 \n\ndays a dense layer was found on both surfaces. Needle-shaped crystallites fully covering the surfaces \n\ncan be observed after 21 days. The morphology of the precipitated layer on GS31N0 is somehow \n\ndifferent from that on GS25N6, probably due to the different degrees of crystallinity of the calcium \n\nphosphates formed on the scaffolds, slightly higher on GS31N0, as suggested by the XRD patterns, \n\nFig. VIII.3. \n\n \n\n SEM micrographs of the scaffolds after immersion in SBF during 3, 7 and 21 days, for \n\nGS31N0 (a, b and c) and GS25N20 (d, e and f) respectively \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of \n\nCa-P-Mg-Si-Na scaffolds \n\n155 \n\n \n\nEDS analysis to the precipitated layers confirmed that their chemical compositions can be assigned \n\nto a hydroxyl apatite phase. Fig. VIII. 5, shows for 14 days soaking a Ca/P ratio of 1.6 and 1.7 for \n\nGS31N0 and GS25N6 respectively, while in the stoichiometric HA Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 is 1.67.  \n\nThe above results indicate that these scaffolds can induce the formation with different rates, of a \n\nHCA layer on their surface in SBF, confirming the bioactivity of the scaffolds and their capacity as \n\na material for bone tissue engineering.  \n\n \n Variation of Ca/P ratio with soaking time, up to 14 days, for GS31N0 and GS25N6 \n\ndetermined by EDS. Lines are to guide the eye \n\nThe ion release profile of the glass scaffolds in SBF provides an outline of the degradation behaviour \n\nof all ions of the glass, Fig. VIII.6.  \n\nAfter the initial short period, in which phosphorus ions dissolution occurs, it is observed for GS25N6 \n\na decrease of P ion concentration in solution, together with the drop of Ca2+ concentration, soon \n\nafter 1 day, Fig. VIII.6a.  \n\nIn the base glass scaffold, GS31N0, it was found that the concentration of calcium increased up 7 \n\ndays followed by a gradually decrease. After 1 hour immersion, phosphate ions remain almost \n\nconstant up to 7 days followed also by a decreased. \n\nThe GS25N6 release the greatest amount of Si in the first hour and Mg in the first day, Fig. VIII.6b. \n\nAfter the first hour, Si dissolution profile was similar for both scaffolds. Si concentration increased \n\nduring the first 7 days immersion, and then no significant changes took place, Fig. VIII.6b. The \n\nMg concentration release on GS25N6 was lower than that observed for GS31N0 as a consequence \n\nof the lower content of MgO in the composition of the G25N6 glasses. The decrease in Mg2+ \n\nconcentrations in the SBF after reaching maximum can also indicates that such ions could be \n\nincorporated in the HA layer formed on the surface of the glasses, as confirmed by XRD presence \n\nof apatite and whitlockite phases, for 14 days immersion. \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of Ca-P-Mg-Si-Na \n\nscaffolds \n\n \n\n156 \n\n \n\nThe pH variation with time, Fig. VIII.6c, strongly increased during the first 72 h for GS25N6, \n\nreaching a value of 8.2 after 14 days. The increase of pH on GS31N0 was slower, increasing up to \n\n8.2 after 7 days immersion and then no significant change took place. This increase probably \n\nresults from the reduction in the concentration of H+ ions due to their exchange with the cations in \n\nthe glasses (Ca2+, Mg2+ and also Na+ in the GS25N6). The stabilization of the Ca2+ concentration \n\nin SBF can be explained by considering two opposite processes. In one hand, the release of Ca2+ \n\nfrom the glass, and in the other hand, the consumption of these ions due to the formation of the \n\napatite-type layer, as confirmed by SEM images in Fig. VIII.5.  Together with this process the \n\nincrease of hydroxyl concentration in the solution contributes for the attack of the silica glass \n\nnetwork, resulting in the breaking of Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si bonds and consequent formation of Si \u2013 OH \n\n(silanols) on the glass/solution interface (FTIR results, Fig. VIII.2b. The condensation and re-\n\npolymerisation of a SiO2-rich layer on the surface of the scaffolds may explain the stabilization of \n\nSi and pH, Fig. VIII.6c, in the solution.  \n\nThe formation of apatite due to the crystallization of the amorphous calcium phosphate by \n\nincorporation of OH and CO3\n2- anions from the solution, is confirmed by FTIR, XRD and EDS. \n\n \n Variations, after soaking the scaffolds GS31N0 and GS25N6 in SBF of (a) phosphorus \n\nand calcium content and (b) silica and magnesium content and (c) pH values. Lines are to guide \n\nthe eye \n\nWith the introduction of sodium in the glass composition to produce the GS25N6 scaffold, the \n\nnetwork connectivity reduces and the glass solubility tends to increase. In fact substituting \n\nMgO with Na2O usually produces more degradable glasses, since Na\n+ ions have less stronger \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of \n\nCa-P-Mg-Si-Na scaffolds \n\n157 \n\n \n\nfield strengths than Mg2+ ions [37]. This seems to facilitate the higher concentration of Mg \n\nand Si in the first hours and consequent higher pH, in the first 72 hours. \n\nThe lower rate of the calcium phosphate layer formation, due to the presence of Mg observed \n\nin the GS31N0 composition in the first hours, is also reported in literature [34], with glasses \n\ncontaining MgO above 7 mol. %. The role of Mg2+ is interpreted as an inhibitor in the formation \n\nof the silica gel  [38], due to the suppressing effect on the calcium dissolution. Marie Vallet-Reg?? et \n\nal [34] also reported a whitlockite-like phase together with the apatite-like phase and an increase in \n\nthickness of the formed HA layer with the height content of MgO. \n\nVIII.3.3 Biocompatibility studies \n\nHuman bone marrow cells, cultured in experimental conditions that favour the osteoblastic \n\ndifferentiation [23,24] were seeded over the glass scaffold (GS31N0 and GS25N6 ) samples up to \n\n21 days. Fig. VIII.7 shows the results for viability/proliferation and the ALP activity observed over \n\nthe materials. Cell viability/proliferation increased throughout the 21 days culture time on both \n\nscaffolds. At day 7, values observed on GS25N6 were significantly lower indicating the presence of \n\na lower number of cells, compared to that on GS31N0. This observation suggests some deleterious \n\neffects in the adhesion of the cells on GS25N6 and on the subsequent proliferation during the first \n\ndays of culture. This is most probably due to the high dynamics of the interactions between this \n\nscaffold and the medium observed during the first days, as described above, leading to a surface \n\ninstability which hinders cell adhesion. However, after that period, cells proliferated with a high \n\ngrowth rate and, at day 21, values were only slightly lower than those observed on GS31N0. The \n\nprogressive establishment of a more stable surface environment on GS25N6, with time, created \n\nfavourable conditions for cell proliferation.  \n\nALP activity also increased with culture time in both scaffolds, suggesting the on-going of \n\ndifferentiation osteogenic pathway. ALP is an early marker of osteoblast lineage cells, and is known \n\nto have a determinant role in the mineralization of the extracellular collagenous matrix, by providing \n\nphosphate ions that, with calcium ions are used in the formation of the cell-mediated mineralized \n\nmatrix [39]. Compared to GS31N0, ALP activity was significantly lower on GS25N6 at days 7 and \n\n14. However, at day 21, the enzyme activity was only slightly lower. These results suggest that, after \n\nthe initial delay, cultures recovered tending to behave similarly to that observed on GS31N0.  \n\nColonized scaffolds were observed by SEM up to day 21. At day 7, both scaffolds presented well \n\nspread cells, adapting to the irregular underlying topography, and evidence of cell growth inside the \n\npores. GS25N6 presented lower number of attached cells. At day 21, a more abundant and organized \n\ncell layer was noticed on both scaffolds and, in close association, the presence of mineralized deposits \n\nwas observed (slightly lower in GS25N6).  \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of Ca-P-Mg-Si-Na \n\nscaffolds \n\n \n\n158 \n\n \n\n \n Cell viability/proliferation (a) and alkaline phosphatase activity (b) of human osteoblastic \n\nbone marrow cells cultured on the glass scaffolds GS31N0 and GS25N6  up to 21 \n\ndays.*Significantly different from GS31N0  \n\n \n\n SEM observation of human osteoblastic bone marrow cells cultured on the glass scaffolds \n\nGS31 (a, b and c) and GS25N6 (d, e and f) for 7 days (a, d) and 21 days (b, c, e and f) with two \n\ndifferent magnifications   \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of \n\nCa-P-Mg-Si-Na scaffolds \n\n159 \n\n \n\nBiocompatibility observations are in line with those reported in the bioactivity studies performed in \n\nSBF (Figs. VIII.4 and 5). Both glass scaffolds compositions GS31N0 and GS25N6 were able to \n\nsupport the formation of cells mediated mineralized deposits. The globular structures associated with \n\nthe cell layer, seen at day 21 (Fig. VIII.8 (c and f)), contain Ca and P peaks. The observed rough \n\nsurface, due to the sintering with salt, is a key factor in the attachment and proliferation of bone cells, \n\nincreasing the surface area of the scaffold. \n\nThe higher concentration of magnesium present in the ICP measurements in the first days due to the \n\nfaster degradation on the glass scaffolds containing sodium, may result in a negative effect on \n\nadhesion and initial cell proliferation.  \n\nFrom the results above, it is indicated that the composition modification of the scaffolds had a \n\ndeleterious effect on the attachment and proliferation of HBMC\u2019s during the first days. As referred \n\nabove, the faster degradation originates highly dynamic ion exchange reactions, which is \n\ndeleterious for cell attachment, as the ionic environment influences the interaction of cells and \n\nmaterials. However, the progressive stabilization of the cell surface allowed a fast recovery of the \n\nosteoblastic proliferation and differentiation. In vivo, it is believed that this initial effect might be \n\ngreatly attenuated, due to the continuous circulation of the body fluids, improving cell response \n\n[5,18]. \n\nVIII.4 Conclusions \n\nTwo similar glass scaffolds with different chemical compositions in the system 3CaO.P2O5- SiO2-\n\nMgO-Na2O have been successfully prepared by the salt sintering method. The scaffolds exhibited in \n\nvitro bioactive behaviour, as a hydroxyapatite layer was formed on samples surface after soaking in \n\nsimulated body fluids.  \n\nCell culture studies of the glass scaffolds using HBM cells showed that both scaffolds possessed \n\ngood cellular response in terms of cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation.  \n\nSubstitution of MgO by Na2O in the base glass network, lowered the scaffolds chemical durability, \n\nwhich explains the faster degradation rate and formation of surface HA. The faster degradation \n\noriginates highly dynamic ion exchange reactions, with deleterious effect on the attachment and \n\nproliferation of HBMC\u2019s during the first days. A rapid recover of the Na containing scaffold \n\npromote similar results for longer times. Therefore, the produced scaffolds can be proposed as \n\neffective candidates in the field of bone tissue replacement due to their easy tailoring, bioactivity and \n\nbiocompatibility.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nVIII\u2013Effect of glass composition on the in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility of Ca-P-Mg-Si-Na \n\nscaffolds \n\n \n\n160 \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nI would like to express my thanks to Professor Maria Helena Raposo Fernandes and her group - \n\nSchool of Dental Medicine, University of Porto \u2013 for their collaboration in studies of in vitro \n\nbiocompatibility. \n\nReferences  \n\n[1] I.A.

Glass-ceramics and glasses have significant differences in the \n\nformation of this layer due to distinct surface reactivities. The surface reactivity is related with the \n\nrate of glass dissolution and with the nature and amount of crystalline phases in the glass-ceramics. \n\nThe in vitro behaviour of the 3CaO.P2O5\u2013SiO2\u2013MgO glass and glass-ceramics bulks and their \n\ncorresponding scaffolds, were studied in this work. FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDS analysis of the \n\nsamples after immersion in simulated body fluid showed the presence of an apatite layer on their \n\nsurfaces, which formed faster on the glass than on the glass-ceramics. In addition, biocompatibility \n\nstudies were investigated by in vitro cell culture with human bone marrow cells. The cells showed a \n\nnormal morphology and high growth rate in the glass when compared to standard culture plates. \n\nContrarily, lower cell proliferation occurred in the glass-ceramics, especially on the bulk probably \n\ndue to high Mg ionic concentration in the cell culture medium as a consequence of the degradation \n\nof the amorphous phase. Therefore, the goal of an ideal scaffold that provides good mechanical \n\nsupport temporarily while maintaining a tailorable bioactivity and biocompatibility can be achieved \n\nwith the development of glass-ceramic scaffolds. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n \n\n168 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n169 \n\n \n\n \n\nIX.1. Introduction \n\nSince the development by Hench et al. [1,2], of the designated 45S5 Bioglass, with a composition of \n\n45% SiO2, 24.5% Na2O, 24.4% CaO and 6% P2O5 in wt. %, many different compositions have been \n\nexplored over the years for bone repair applications. Bioactive glasses constitute an interesting group \n\nof inorganic materials to be used as bone repair scaffolds, due to their high bioactivity, \n\nbiocompatibility, osteoconductive and osteoproductive properties [3,4]. These materials are able to \n\nbind with bone and soft tissues through their unique ability to form a hydroxyl carbonate apatite \n\n(HCA) layer on the surface as a result of their chemical reactivity in physiological media. The release \n\nof ionic species from bioactive glasses, due to dissolution, is the first step of a sequence of events \n\nthat lead to the precipitation of HCA on the glass surface in vitro [5,6] and in vivo [7,8], creating a \n\nfavourable environment for osteoblast proliferation and differentiation thus stimulating new bone \n\nformation. This sequence of events, reactions on the material surface, are explained in detail by \n\nHench [2,9,10]. The degradation kinetics of the glasses should match the regeneration kinetics of \n\nnew bone in vitro and/or in vivo. A further requirement, particularly in bone engineering, for a \n\nscaffold, is a controllable interconnected porosity that can provide greater surface area for \n\nvascularization, and bone in-growth [11,12].  \n\nDeveloping biocompatible glass and glass scaffolds with adequate degradability and appropriate \n\nmechanical properties for tissue engineering applications remains a challenge for biomedical \n\nengineers [13\u201315]. Controllable dissolution rates and suitable strength can be achieved by the \n\nproduction of glass-ceramics through controlled glass crystallization [16]. \n\nChen et al [17] have successfully synthesized highly porous, mechanically competent, bioactive and \n\nbiodegradable 45S5 Bioglass-derived glass\u2013ceramic scaffolds for bone engineering, with fine \n\ncrystals of Na2Ca2Si3O9. After immersion in simulated body fluid for 28 days, this crystalline phase \n\nwas transformed into an amorphous calcium phosphate phase. By controlling the crystallinity \n\nfraction, authors found that the biodegradable rate could be tailored since the degradation rate and \n\nconversion to an HA-like material of 45S5 glass-ceramics become very slow with crystallization \n\nincrease [18].  \n\nPrevious work on the crystallization process of a 3CaO.P2O5\u2013SiO2\u2013MgO glass has shown that the \n\ncrystallization of this glass starts with the whitlockite phase (in fact magnesium whitlockite \u2013 \n\n(Ca2.589MgO0.411)(PO4)2), also known as ?-TCMP [19].  \n\nIt has been reported [20] that the presence of magnesium in ?-TCP, significantly decreases the \n\nsolubility due to the partially replacement of Ca2+ by Mg2+, a smaller cation that promotes increased \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n \n\n170 \n\n \n\nbonding and consequent stability. Recently, the Mg-containing ?-TCP [21,22] has been gain much \n\nattention, improving bone metabolism and biocompatibility [23,24] when compared to ?-TCP. \n\nThe aim of this work was to modulate the glass surface reactivity through carefully controlled thermal \n\ntreatments obtaining a glass-ceramic, with only one crystalline phase, whitlockite. The effect of \n\ncrystallinity degree on the in vitro behaviour was attested in simulated body fluid SBF and through \n\nhuman osteoblast cells response. The effect of microstructural characteristics on the bioactivity of \n\nthe glass\u2013ceramics (bulk and porous scaffolds) was also discussed. \n\nIX.2. Materials and Methods \n\n Glass and glass-ceramic bulks  \n\nGlass with molar composition 32.7 % CaO, 10.9 % P2O5, 25.4 % SiO2 and 31 % MgO (mol. %)  was \n\nproduced by conventional melt quenching technique, mixing the required amounts of analytical grade \n\nSiO2, Ca(H2PO4)2.H2O, MgO and CaCO3 and melting at 1500 \u00baC in Pt crucible for 2 h in air.  \n\nThe glass was cast in a stainless steel mould and annealed for 30 minutes at 740 \u00baC. The bulk glass \n\nsamples were prepared with dimensions of 1 x 1 x 0.5 cm3, polished with sandpaper grain size \n\nsuccessively thinner and finished with diamond paste of 15, 6, 3 and 1 \u00b5m particle size. The polished \n\nsamples were cleaned in ultrasonic bath, first with alcohol and then with ultrapure water.  \n\nThe samples were further treated, based on DTA data obtain in previous work [19], at 840 and 910 \n\n\u00baC for 2 hours at a heating rate of 5 \u00baC min-1 in order to crystallize the glass samples. The amorphous \n\nbulk specimens were designated G31 and the glass-ceramics were denominated G31C-84 and G31C-\n\n91 in accordance with their respective heat treatment, at 840 and 910 \u00baC, respectively. After heat \n\ntreatment the samples were polished with diamond paste of 15, 6, 3 and 1\u00b5m particle size. \n\n Scaffolds  \n\nGlasses were also prepared in frit form for scaffolds production using the salt sintering technique \n\n[25]. The frit was dried and then milled and sieved to obtain glass powders with mean particle size \n\nof 3.5 \u00b5m, as determined by the light scattering technique (Coulter LS 230, Fraunhofer optical model, \n\nMA). A mixture of glass particles and 50 wt. % NaCl (212-500 ?m) was prepared. The mixture was \n\npressed and sintered at 750 \u00baC for 10 min. After sintering, the incorporated porogen was removed \n\nthrough aqueous washing, thus resulting a porous glass scaffold, denominated GS31, with ~ 65 % \n\nporosity, containing macropores with diameters between 150 and 500 ?m and micropores with \n\ndiameter &lt;60 ?m.  \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n171 \n\n \n\nCrystallization of the glass scaffolds was performed by heating the samples in an electric furnace up \n\nto 900 \u00baC, at a heating rate 5 \u00baC min\u20131, and maintained at this temperature for 30 min, in order to \n\ncrystallize the glass scaffolds. These heat-treatments were chosen based on dilatometric and DTA \n\nanalysis of the glass/salt mixture, as studied before [25]. These glass-ceramic scaffolds were \n\ndenominated GS31C-90.  \n\nMechanical properties of the scaffolds at compression were studied in a Bose/Electro Force 3400 \n\ntesting machine. Six cylindrical samples (10 x 10 mm2) were compressed at a speed of 0.5 mm min-\n\n1. Prior to mechanical testing, the contact surfaces of each sample were ground to produce smooth \n\nparallel surfaces. \n\nMercury Intrusion Porosimetry, was used to measure both porosity and pore sizes using an AutoPore \n\nIV 9500V1.07 serial 734 Penetrometer. Sample weight varied from 0.25 to 0.3 g. Given that the \n\nporosimeter measurement determines the intruded volume of mercury per gram sample, it is assumed \n\nthat this value gives the open porosity i.e., is equal to the porous volume (V) per gram sample. \n\n Phase analysis \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed in all samples using a Rigaku Diffractometer \n\nGeigerflex Dmax-C at room temperature with CuK? radiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed \n\nof 0.02\u00ba s-1. Data was obtained in the 2? range of 10-80 degree to investigate the characteristic phases \n\nand crystallinity amount of the fabricated samples. For XRD measurements, the samples were ground \n\nand measured in powder form. \n\nThe amount of the crystalline phase (crystallized volume fraction) contained in the glass-ceramic, \n\nbulk and scaffolds, was determined according to the procedure used by Krimm and Tobolsky [26] \n\nand recently by Daguano et al  [27]. The percent crystallinity, CF, was calculated by the ratio of the \n\ncrystalline area, CA, present in the diffractogram of the glass-ceramics and the total area, TA \n\n(amorphous + crystalline), present in this diffractogram using the following equation [28]: \n\nCF = (CA/TA) x 100                                (Eq. IX.1) \n\nThe crystallized phases were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi Su-\n\n70, Japan system. Back-scattered electron (BSE) images were also used on bulk glass-ceramics. \n\n In vitro bioactivity  \n\nThe in vitro behaviour was assessed by soaking glass and glass-ceramic bulk and porous samples in \n\nsimulated body fluid (SBF) for periods from 1 hour up to 14 days. The SBF solution was prepared \n\naccording to the formulation of Kokubo and Takadama [29]. A constant specimen surface area to \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n \n\n172 \n\n \n\nsolution volume ratio of 0.1 cm?1 was used, considering the value of the surface area given by the \n\nBET method. Glass-ceramic bulk samples were also analyzed for longer times, 10, 20, 30 days and \n\n5 months. Subsequently the samples were placed in a polyethylene bottle containing SBF solution, \n\nand kept for various periods of time, without shaking, in an incubator at 37 \u00baC, in accordance with a \n\nprotocol referred to in literature [30\u201332]. Four samples were used for each immersion time. After \n\nremoval from the SBF, samples were dried at 60 \u00baC. The assessment of the samples dissolution \n\nprofile, ionic concentration changes in SBF, was based on data from inductively coupling plasma \n\nspectrometry (ICP) testing using a Jobin-Yvon JY70 Plus, France. The pH changes were evaluated \n\nat the different soaking times. \n\nSEM and XRD were used as described previously. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was \n\napplied to analyze the elemental composition of the surface of the samples immersed in SBF at \n\ndifferent time intervals. For EDS analysis the samples were carbon sputtered under high vacuum (6.7 \n\nx 10-3 Pa).  \n\nFTIR analysis, were also used to characterize the HA-like layer formed on all samples after \n\nimmersion in SBF. Bulk samples were recorded in a Brucker tensor 27 spectrometer, using a Golden \n\nGate single reflection diamond ATR system, with no need for sample preparation. Scaffolds were \n\nreduced to powder and mixed with KBr (ratio 1:10) and pressed into a pellet using a hand press. All \n\nspectra were collected over a region of 4000 \u2013 400 cm?1 and taken as the average of two independent \n\nmeasurements with 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm?1. For comparison purposes samples without \n\nimmersion were analysed as well. \n\n Osteoblastic cytocompatibility  \n\nIX.2.5.1. Human bone marrow cell cultures \n\nHuman bone marrow, obtained from orthopaedic surgery procedures (after patient informed consent), \n\nwas cultured in ?-Minimal Essential Medium (?-MEM) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, \n\n100 mg/ml penicillin, 10 IU streptomycin, 2.5 mg ml-1 fungizone, at 37 \u00baC in a humidified \n\natmosphere of 5 % CO2 in air. For subculture, the cell monolayer was incubated with a trypsin\u2013\n\nEDTA solution (0.05 % trypsin, 0.25 % EDTA) for 10 min at 37 \u00baC to detach the cells. Cells were \n\nre-suspended in culture medium and seeded (5 x 104 cells cm-2) over the material samples \n\n(previously sterilized by autoclaving at 120 \u00baC).  Seeded material samples were cultured for 21 \n\ndays in the presence of 50 ?g ml-1 ascorbic acid, 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate and 10 nM \n\ndexamethasone. This experimental conditions are reported to allow the osteoblast differentiation in \n\nthis culture system [33]. All the experiments were performed in the first subculture, since the \n\nsequential passage of bone marrow cells results in a progressive loss of the osteoblastic phenotype \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n173 \n\n \n\n[34]. Colonized materials were evaluated for cell morphology, cell viability/proliferation, alkaline \n\nphosphatase (ALP) activity and ability to form calcium phosphate deposits.   \n\nIX.2.5.2.  Cell viability/proliferation \n\nCell viability/proliferation was evaluated by the Resazurin assay. Resazurin (7-Hydroxy-3H-\n\nphenoxazin-3-one 10-oxide), a non-fluorescent blue component is reduced in the mitochondria of the \n\nliving cells to the pink fluorescent component resorufin. This is a non-destructive assay, alloying the \n\nsame samples to be followed throughout the culture time. At each time-point, culture medium was \n\nremoved, and fresh medium with 10 % (v/v) of resazurin was added to the cells. Cultures were \n\nincubated at 37 \u00baC in a humidified atmosphere of 95 % air and 5 % CO2 for 3 h. Then, 100 \u00b5L of the \n\nculture medium were transferred to a 96-well plate and the fluorescence intensity was measured in a \n\nmicroplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek, USA) at 535 nm excitation wavelength and 590 nm \n\nemission wavelength. The results were expressed in relative fluorescence units.  \n\nFor celular observation, samples were fixed (1.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.14 M sodium cacodylate \n\nbuffer, pH = 7.3, 10 min), dehydrated in graded alcohols, critical-point dried, sputter-coated with a \n\nAu/Pd thin film (SPI Module Sputter Coater equipment), and observed in a High resolution \n\n(Schottky) Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (Quanta 400 FEG ESEM) with a X-ray \n\nenergy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) microanalysis capability. \n\nIX.2.5.3. Alkaline phosphatase activity \n\nALP activity was evaluated in cell lysates (0.1 % Triton X-100, 5 min) by the hydrolysis of p-\n\nnitrophenyl phosphate in alkaline buffer solution (pH ~10.3; 30 min, 37 \u00baC) and colorimetric \n\ndetermination of the product (p-nitrophenol) at 400 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Synergy HT, \n\nBiotek). ALP activity was normalized to total protein content (quantified by Bradford\u2019s method) and \n\nwas expressed as nmol/min.?g protein-1.  \n\nIX.2.5.4. Statistical analysis \n\nValues are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of three replicates and were compared using \n\nthe student\u2019s t-test, with a significance level of p &lt;0.05. \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n \n\n174 \n\n \n\nIX.3. Results and discussion \n\n Bulk and scaffolds characterization \n\nThe XRD patterns of all the samples, glass and glass-ceramics bulk and scaffolds are shown in Fig. \n\nIX.1a and 1b, respectively. All glass-ceramics studied in this work presented a whitlockite phase \n\nwith Ca substituting Mg, (Ca,Mg)O\u00b7P2O5 solid solution or  ?-TCMP, according to the card No. 01-\n\n087-1582 in the X\u2019Pert HighScore database. As can be observed in Fig. IX. 1, a higher degree of \n\ncrystallization was obtained in the glass-ceramics bulk by increasing the temperature from 840 to \n\n910 \u00baC, with a holding time of 2 hours. The XRD pattern of the glass-ceramic scaffold, GS31C-91, \n\nafter heat treatment at 910 \u00baC, 30 min, were also shown in Fig. IX.1.  \n\nGlass-ceramic G31C-84 presents an amount of 39 % crystal phase, calculated according to Eq. IX.1. \n\nThe crystallinity (CF) increased considerably to 82 % with the treatment at 910 \u00baC, G31C-91. Glass-\n\nceramic scaffolds presented an amount of 76 % crystal phase. As observed in previous work [25] the \n\nsalt sintering method promote an earlier crystallization of the glass scaffolds when compared to the \n\nglass heat treatment without salt. In this case, it is possible to obtain the same crystalline phase with \n\na treatment 10 \u00baC lower and a holding time 90 min shorter. Although the goal of the work was to \n\nprepare a glass-ceramic bulk and scaffold with the same crystalline fraction, due to experimental \n\ndifficulties (presence of a second crystalline phase on the scaffold) we choose to work with a \n\ndifference of 6 % crystalline fraction between the G31C-91 and the GS31C-90.   \n\n \n\nFig.IX.1.

In vitro bioactivity of bulk samples  \n\nDuring the first SBF soaking hour it was observed mainly the dissolution of the glass bulk, G31, Fig. \n\nIX.4a and 4b. With one day immersion, Fig. IX.4c, it was already observed a completely formed \n\nlayer. Finally, for 5 and 7 days immersion the precipitated layer takes a form of plates with reasonable \n\ndimensions, Fig. IX.4d, weakly adherent to the glass surface (without effort the layer stands out).  \n\n \nFig.IX.4.

In vitro bioactivity of the bulk glass-ceramic  \n\nIn the first soaking hours of the glass-ceramic samples, G31C-84 and -91, it was observed the \n\ndissolution of sample. G31C-84 dissolution occurs primarily between crystals of calcium phosphate, \n\nas can be seen in Fig. IX.5a and 5b. With the immersion time, the amount of small deposits \n\nconsiderably increases. With 30 days immersion, Fig. IX.5c, it was clearly seen the formation of \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n177 \n\n \n\nprecipitates on the surface, with approximately 8 \u00b5m wide. To better understand the nature of the \n\nprecipitated layer and also to obtain a sufficiently representative thickness layer, a 5 months \n\nimmersion was performed, wherein the SBF was replaced monthly. A large precipitate amount was \n\nobserved on the surface of the glass-ceramics, Fig. IX.5e, where a part of the glass-ceramic was \n\npartially covered by a fissured layer, apparently with no separation from the substrate.  \n\nThe G31C-91 with an IC of 82 % had a slower dissolution. During the thirty days of immersion in \n\nSBF it wasn\u2019t detected any formation of precipitates, Fig. IX.5d, in G31C-91 while on the surface of \n\nG31C-84, Fig. IX.5c, globular structures and cracks are noticed.  \n\nThe same results are observed only after 5 months, for the G31C-91 in Fig. IX.5f. During immersion \n\nin SBF, the onset time of the precipitate layer formation changed from 1 day, for the original bulk \n\nglass, to 5 months for the 82 % crystallized sample. The reaction rate was reduced with increase \n\ncrystallization degree. \n\n                     G31C-84            G31C-94 \n\n \n\nFig.IX.5.

After 7 days immersion, Fig. IX. 6c), it was observed a complete \n\ncoverage of the surface of the porous structure. Glass-ceramic scaffolds also present spherical \n\nparticles aggregates that for 7 days almost fully cover the surface.  For soaking times below 7 days \n\nthere was no clear difference on the surfaces of the glass and glass-ceramic scaffold, i.e., there are \n\nno obvious effect of crystallinity on the precipitated structures of the scaffolds. \n\n            GS31                      GS31C90 \n\n \n\nFig.IX.6.

Analysis of the precipitated layer \n\nThe XRD analysis, Fig. IX.7, presented on the glass bulk samples after 7 days immersion and on \n\nglass-ceramics after 5 months immersion, the diffraction peaks characteristic of hydroxyapatite at \n\n2?= 25.9\u00ba, 31.6\u00ba, 32.7\u00ba, 34\u00ba, 50\u00ba and 53\u00ba attributed to reflections (0 0 2), (1 2 1), (3 0 0), (2 0 2), (2 1 \n\n3) and (0 0 4) respectively accordingly to the card No. 01-073-2567. \n\nAfter 5 months immersion in SBF, both glass-ceramic bulks presented in addition to the growing \n\npeaks of hydroxyapatite-like phase, the decrease crystallinity of the whitlockite phase. The sharp \n\ndiffraction peaks of the whitlockite phase, observed in Fig. IX.1, disappeared from the XRD \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n179 \n\n \n\nspectrum of the G31C-84 leaving a typical broad halo (produced by an amorphous phase) overlapped \n\nby the sharp diffraction peaks of the HA phase. This indicates that under the detection limits of XRD, \n\nthe G31C-84 was mainly composed of an amorphous phase and crystalline apatite. \n\nIn the glass scaffold, Fig. IX.7b, after 3 day immersion it was detected the characteristic peaks of \n\ncrystalline hydroxyapatite. After 14 days immersion, the scaffold GS31 present increased intensity \n\nof the characteristic peaks of hydroxyapatite, 2? = 25.9\u00ba, 31.6\u00ba, 32.7\u00ba, 34\u00ba, 50\u00ba card No.01-073-2567. \n\nAlso incipient peaks of whitlockite (Ca2.859Mg0.411(PO4)2) appear in the GS31 at the peaks 28\u00ba, 31\u00ba, \n\nand 36\u00ba, corresponding to the planes (2 1 4), (0 2 10) and (2 1 10) according to the card No. 01-087-\n\n1582.  \n\nThe difference between G31 and GS31 bioactivity are more evident in XRD. For 7 days immersion \n\nthe apatite layer on the G31 was more crystalline than that on GS31. \n\nThe glass-ceramic scaffold presented after 3 days, a decrease intensity of the whitlockite peaks, but \n\nno detectable apatite phase peaks. After 7 days immersion, the whitlockite was still present with \n\nlower intensity and the diffraction peaks characteristic of hydroxyapatite emerge with increase \n\nintensity after 14 days immersion. The peaks characteristic of whitlockite phase almost disappears \n\nafter 14 days immersion. \n\nThe transformation of a crystalline phase to a degradable amorphous phase prior to CHA layer \n\ndeposition, observed in this work for all glass-ceramics, was also observed in the literature on 45S5 \n\nglass-ceramics [35], HA and related calcium phosphates ceramics in an in vivo environment [23].  \n\nAs the crystallization fraction increase the time required for HA layer formation on the material \n\nsurface was higher. The glass-ceramic scaffold high surface area increased the kinetic of this \n\ntransformation, lowering the onset of HA formation when compared to the bulk glass-ceramics. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n \n\n180 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFig.IX.7.

The broad resonance in the \n\nrange 850\u2013950 cm-1 correspondent to the Si \u2013 O \u2013 NBO (non-bridging oxygen) vibrational mode was \n\nassociated with the Ca ions in the glass network. \n\nThe bulk glass-ceramics before immersion presented a peak at 1060 cm?1 and a double peak at 565 \n\nand 603 cm-1, attributed to the P \u2013 O bending vibrations due to the presence of whitlockite phase \n\n[36].  \n\nIn the glass bulk, Fig. IX.8a, after 7 days, the appearance of the double peak from P \u2013 O bending \n\nbonds at 565 and 605 cm-1 revealed the presence of HA. The C ? O stretching band at 800\u2013890 cm-1 \n\nand P \u2013 O stretching at 910\u20131040 cm-1 are due the crystalline nature of HCA layer [37].  \n\nThe increased definition of the peaks related to PO vibrations, P ? O bend ( at 565, 603 1 and 1050 \n\ncm-) and the apperence of a P ? O stretch (at 1120 and 945 cm-1) is indicative of an increase in the \n\ncrystallinity of the precipitated HCA layer [37], on the glass-ceramic scaffold, after 7 days immersion. \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n181 \n\n \n\nIn the G31C-84 spectrum, Fig. IX.8c, as the crystalline Ca-P layer grows, the double peaks \n\ncorrespondent to P ? O bend (at 565, 605 and 1050 cm-1) become sharp and dominate the FTIR \n\nspectra after 5 months immersion, indicating the growth of crystalline apatite in vitro. \n\nThe G31C-91, Fig. IX.8d, samples does not show modification of the structure after 7 days. Well \n\nestablished hydroxyapatite were present at 5 months, as evidenced by the pronounced dual P \u2013 O \n\npeaks near 602 and 575 cm-1 in the glass-ceramic and the presence of the peaks at 1450 and 1410 \n\ncm-1 and a third at 870 cm-1, due to the presence of CO vibration.  \n\nThese results suggest that the apatite formed on the surface of all bulk samples, after 7 days and 5 \n\nmonths immersion in SBF, for glass and glass-ceramic bulks respectively, was carbonated apatite, \n\nwhich is similar in composition and structure to bone apatite.  Glass-ceramic scaffolds results after \n\n7 days immersion were similar to the glass bulk. \n\nThe characteristic bands of the hydroxyl carbonate apatite layer (HCA) after 5 months immersion \n\ncompletely overlays the peaks related to Si \u2013 O bonds.  \n\n \n\nFig.IX.8.

The glass-ceramic \n\nbulk spectrums after 5 months soaking are also presented.  \n\nThe EDS pattern for the bulk glass, G31, Fig. IX.9, reveals that after 5 days immersed in SBF (value \n\nnot shown) the precipitated layer observed on Fig. IX.3c, has a Ca/P ratio of 1.30 near an octacalcium \n\nphosphate OCP (Ca/P = 1.33) that gradually changes to hydroxyapatite (Ca/P = 1.66) between 14 \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n \n\n182 \n\n \n\nand 21 days immersion. This value is very similar to the Ca/P molar ratio characteristic of \n\nstoichiometric HA - 1.67. \n\nFor the glass-ceramic bulk, G31C-84, the OCP layer was only observed at 7 days immersion where \n\na Ca/P ratio of 1.32 was detected on the precipitates observed at Fig. IX.3c. Up to 21 days, the \n\nprecipitated layer exhibit a pronounced increase in the Ca and P signal, with a Ca/P ratio of 1.60. \n\nIn the G31C-91, the kinetic deposition rate decreased, since the analysis of the precipitated layer on \n\nthe surface of the glass-ceramic, for 5 months immersion, only detected the presence of a Ca/P ratio \n\nof 1.57. The presence of higher crystalline phase has a slowdown effect on the in vitro behaviour of \n\nthe glass-ceramics. \n\nGlass scaffold, after 1 day immersion, present a Ca/P ratio near 1, due to the presence of brushite. \n\nBetween 14 and 21 days the Ca/P ratio increased from 1.62 to 1.67. In the glass-ceramic scaffolds, \n\nit was detected a Ca/P ratio of 1.54, after 14 days immersion. After 21 days a Ca/P of 1.63 was \n\ndetected. The high surface area of the glass-ceramic scaffolds make possible that the transformation \n\nof whitlockite into the amorphous phase of calcium phosphate occurs at a reasonably faster rate than \n\nthat on bulk glass-ceramics, since in fact the bioactive reactions only occur at the surface of the bulk \n\nsolid glass-ceramics. For the same reasons, the glass scaffold present higher dissolution rate than the \n\nbulk glass. For 14 days immersion there is no difference between G31 and GS31 samples, both \n\npresent a Ca/P ~ 1.6.  \n\n   \nFig.IX.9. EDS profiles of the glass and glass-ceramic bulk and scaffolds. For each \n\nmeasurement a standard deviation of approximately 0.2 was determined \n\nIX.3.2.5. Dissolution in SBF of the studied materials \n\nFig. IX. 10 shows the concentrations of Ca, Mg, P and Si ions from the studied glass and glass- \n\nceramics, bulk and scaffolds samples, after being soaked in SBF for different times.  \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n183 \n\n \n\nThe bulk glass-ceramics G31C-84 and -91, exhibit similar dissolution profiles between them. When \n\ncompared with the bulk glass, G31, calcium and phosphorous ions are released faster from the glass \n\nbulk, reaching a maximum after 24 hours and then decreases with the development of a Ca-P rich \n\nlayer as confirmed by SEM/EDS and DRX results. On both glass-ceramic bulks Ca ions continue to \n\nincrease in the solution as the other ions.  \n\nThe higher dissolution rate of Si and Mg from glass scaffold, compared to G31 can be explained \n\nby the increase of the surface area.  \n\nThe glass-ceramic scaffolds dissolution profile shows no release of phosphorous species from the \n\nscaffolds, on the contrary, after 14 days immersion, most of the phosphorous was removed from the \n\nSBF. The same behaviour was observed for the Ca ion except in the first hour. The decrease \n\nconcentration of calcium species, after 1 hour immersion, from 110 to 50 mg.l-1 after 14 days, implies \n\nthat calcium ions deposited on the glass-ceramic surface after 1 h immersion.  \n\nThe higher magnesium dissolution observed in Fig. IX. 10, for both glass-ceramic bulk and glass \n\nscaffold when compared with bulk glass may retard the crystallization of hydroxyapatite by replacing \n\ncalcium in the structure.  \n\nFig.IX.10. Variation of ionic concentration in SBF due to immersion of the parent glass and \n\ncorrespondent glass-ceramics bulk and scaffolds. Lines are to guide the eye. \n\nFig. IX. 11 represents the variation of pH with soaking time for the glass and glass-ceramic bulk and \n\nscaffold samples. All testing solutions with exception to the glass-ceramic scaffold GS31C-90, \n\nshowed a decrease in pH after 1 hour immersion. The bulk glass-ceramic G31C-84 showed the largest \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n \n\n184 \n\n \n\ndecrease achieving the pH of 7.3. After that, for all samples, the pH increased rapidly during the \n\nfirst 125 h of immersion, slowed up and reached a nearly constant, limiting value above 10 days \n\nimmersion. The glass scaffold showed the same trend, stabilizing earlier, after 7 days immersion, \n\nwith a final pH of 8.2. Subsequently, the pH remained constant over the remaining weeks of \n\nimmersion, reaching a saturated state.  The lowest change in the pH-value was observed for the \n\nsolution containing the GS31C-90 increased from the initial value 7.4 to 7.8 at the end of incubation \n\nperiod. The highest change was observed for bulk glass-ceramic G31C-91. \n\nDuring soaking in SBF, Mg and Ca cations are leached from the sample surface in exchange for \n\nH+ ions from the solution (from dissociation of water into H+ and OH?) resulting in an increase of \n\nthe pH-value. The phosphate ions can be exchanged against OH? ions, removing hydroxyl ions from \n\nsolution and providing phosphate ions which buffer the effect of alkali ion release.  \n\nHence, the higher phosphate concentration in the first hour of G31C-91 immersion results in a \n\ndecrease of pH-value. In the case of GS31C-90 the high calcium and phosphate release promote a \n\nmuch lower increase of the pH-value. The similar dissolution profile of Ca and P ions dissolution in \n\nthe bulk G31 promote the slowest increase of the pH value. \n\n \nFig.IX.11.

Evaluating the sequence of reactions observed during the formation of the HCA \n\nlayer, it can be noted that the time required for the glass-ceramics bulk G31C-84 was higher than the \n\nglass bulk and, occurs only after 5 months immersion for G31C-91.  \n\nIn comparison with the G31C-84, there was a decrease in the amount of precipitate layer on the \n\nG31C-91, which can be connected to the decrease in the amount of amorphous phase still present in \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n185 \n\n \n\nthe material. The inhibitory effect of crystallization on the in vitro bioactivity of these kind of \n\nmaterials, was also observed in other systems [35]. This can be linked to the large amount of Mg \n\nreleased from the glass to the solution [38\u201340]. However, in the current work, it was observed that \n\nthe formation of HCA was delayed, but not hindered. The ability to control the degradability of these \n\nglasses, by crystallization, makes them potentially clinically helpful for tissue engineering, \n\nIX.3.2.6. Biocompatibility studies \n\nHuman bone marrow cells, cultured in experimental conditions that favour the osteoblastic \n\ndifferentiation [33,34] were seeded over the glass and glass-ceramics bulk (G31, G31C-84 and \n\nG31C-91) and scaffold (GS31 and GS31C-90) samples for 21 days.  \n\nFig. IX.12 shows the results for viability/proliferation (a) and the ALP activity (b) observed over the \n\nmaterials. For the bulk glass and glass-ceramics, results were compared to those on the standard \n\ntissue culture plate, and were normalized to the surface area. Compared to the polystyrene culture \n\nplate, the G31 glass and the glass-ceramic G31C-84 presented higher viability/proliferation values, \n\nwith a statistical significance at days 14 and 21. However, the glass-ceramic G31C-91 showed lower \n\nvalues throughout the culture time. Among the bulk samples, values were similar for G31 and G31C-\n\n84 samples, and were significantly higher than those on G31C-91.  \n\nALP activity was low at day 7 for all samples. At day 14, compared to the polystyrene surface, values \n\nwere significantly higher on G31 and G31C-84 and lower on G31C-91, particularly at day 14. At \n\nday 21, values were similar in the culture surface, G31 and G31C-84, but they were slightly lower \n\non G31C-91. \n\nRegarding the two tested scaffolds, cell viability/proliferation and ALP activity increased throughout \n\nthe culture time, and the pattern of behavior was similar to that seen on the corresponding bulk \n\nsamples, i.e., values were significantly higher on GS31 compared to that on GS31C-90. Differences \n\nwere higher at day 14 compared to that observed at day 21. ALP is an early osteoblastic marker and \n\nhas a key role in the mineralization of the extracellular matrix, by providing phosphate ions for the \n\nformation of the calcium phosphate deposits [41]. \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n \n\n186 \n\n \n\n \nFig.IX.12.

On high magnification images, the three \n\nbulk surfaces showed elongated cells and a well-organized fibrillar matrix with associated calcium \n\nphosphate mineral deposits, as shown on the EDS spectrum Fig. IX.13.g and 13.h.  \n\nThe matrix mineralization was much lower on the G31C-91 glass-ceramic, compared to that on G31 \n\nand G31C-84.  \n\nRegarding the scaffold samples, cell growth was also observed on GS31 and GS31C-90, although, \n\nsimilar to that observed on the bulk samples, GS31C-90 presented lower cellular proliferation. \n\nHowever, on both scaffolds, there was evidence of cell growth inside the pores and the cell layer was \n\nable to successful adapt to the underlying surface. In addition, the presence of calcium phosphate \n\ndeposits closely associated with the cell layer was observed on both scaffolds, Fig. IX.13.i, \n\nalthough with higher abundance on GS31. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n187 \n\n \n\nControl G31 G31C-84 G31C-91 \n\n \nControl G31 GS31 GS31C-90 \n\n \n\nFig.IX.13.

However, literature have shown that \n\ncytotoxicity in vitro, is not always observed in vivo, since, the effects of ion release under static \n\nconditions is different from the dynamic body fluid system in which the continuous circulation \n\nattenuate the local chemical changes, preventing the excessive level of ions at the interface \n\ncell/material [21,42]. \n\n\n\nIX \u2013 Crystallization effect in the in vitro behaviour of a calcium-phosphate-based glass bulk and scaffold \n\n \n\n188 \n\n \n\nThe level of hydroxyapatite crystallisation (surface reactivity), the HCA rate formation and the \n\nsurface characteristics could influence cell adhesion and the subsequent proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation events. Also Ca, P and Si ionic concentration during sample incubation with cells, \n\ncould influence osteoblastic differentiation [43].  \n\nThe scaffold topography property plays a crucial role not only on the reactivity of the material, but \n\nalso on the ability to trap the new array and facilitate the migration of osteogenic cells and anchoring \n\nto the surface of the material [5]. When this migration occurs the temporary fibrin matrix will suffer \n\ncontraction and consequently will detach from the surface if it is not well secured to the surface [6], \n\nas observed in the bulk glass sample G31 and G31C-84. Other studies have shown [6, 7] that \n\n\u2018\u2018rougher\u2019\u2019 surface will be able to imprison the fibrin matrix, better than a smoother one, and hence \n\nfacilitating the migration of osteogenic cells to the materials surface. The bulk and scaffold glass-\n\nceramics were proven non-cytotoxic and have good cytocompatibility in vitro. The mineralised \n\nnodule formation is basically considered to be the final result of differentiation and function of the \n\nosteoblasts. It is interesting that the final ALP activity were equivalent, bearing in mind the \n\ndifferences in cell number and proliferation observed for each sample at day 14. This may be due to \n\nthe cellular reaching maximum levels on all surfaces due to overgrowth of cells in each culture prior \n\nto day 21 of analysis. The formation of this HCA layer was related to the amount of existing residual \n\nglassy phase since it is a source of ions through the dissolution of this phase.  \n\nIX.4. Conclusion \n\nThe studied glass and glass-ceramic samples presented the ability to induce the precipitation of \n\ncalcium phosphate compounds on its surface, when immersed in synthetic physiological fluids, \n\nindicating that all are potentially bioactive. Bulk glass samples exhibited, after 7 days, a significant \n\nprecipitate formation on the surface rich in Ca and P, as confirmed by FTIR, SEM-EDS and XRD, \n\nalthough, the corresponding glass-ceramics G31C-84 only formed an equivalent layer after 21 days \n\nincubation. \n\nThe kinetics transition of the whitlockite phase to amorphous in the glass-ceramic scaffold seems to \n\nbe sufficiently fast for application of the material in bone engineering and can be controlled by factors \n\nsuch as initial crystallinity and porosity.  \n\nMg ions concentration in SBF have slow down the formation of amorphous calcium phosphate phase \n\nand retarded the crystallisation of HCA on the glass surface. \n\nThe comparative study of glass and glass-ceramics bulk and scaffolds showed that all presented good \n\nperformance regarding bioactivity and osteoblastic cytocompatibility.

Indeed, the variation in chemical functional groups is known \n\nto affect hydrophobicity, which in turn affects protein adsorption and conformation, subsequently \n\naffecting various cellular responses. Different activation methods have been applied to a glass-\n\nceramic G31C-91, where whitlockite was the crystalline phase detected, with a crystallinity percent \n\nof 82 %, in order to expose hydroxyl groups. The formation of silanols on the surface of the activated \n\nglass-ceramic, with acid, basic or neutral aqueous media, was investigated. The cleaned glass-\n\nceramics were then functionalized using 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES).  \n\nThe acetone pre-treated (G31C-91-1) and further silanized (G31C-91-1S) glass-ceramic surfaces \n\npresented the highest contact angle indicating that the acetone pre-treated glass-ceramic surface was \n\nmore hydrophobic and that APTES immobilization was successful. The recover bioactivity of the \n\nacetone treatment before and after silanization, compared with the \u201cas-prepared\u201d glass-ceramic \n\nbioactivity, was investigated using simulated body fluid (SBF) tests up to 21 days. The post-soaking \n\nsamples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy \n\n(EDS) and FTIR. Both glass-ceramic surfaces exhibited an accelerated crystalline hydroxyapatite \n\nlayer formation upon immersion in SBF after 21 days while the \u201cas-prepared\u201d glass-ceramic G31C-\n\n91 had no detected formation of calcium phosphate up to 5 months.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n196 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n197 \n\n \n\nX.1. Introduction \n\nBioactive glasses have the characteristic of bonding to bone provided by the formation of a \n\nbiologically active apatite layer due to the rapid rate of surface reactions. In the last decades, \n\nincreasing effort has been directed toward potential applications of glass-ceramics and to understand \n\nif this is a common characteristic to bioactive glasses and glass-ceramics [1\u20134]. It was demonstrated \n\nin a previous work [5] that when the bioactive glass (mol. %) 32.7% CaO, 10.9% P2O5, 25.4% SiO2 \n\nand 31% MgO was transformed into a glass-ceramic, the formation of the surface apatite layer \n\ndepended on the relative amount of residual glassy phase in the glass-ceramic. The glass-ceramic \n\nwith 18 % of residual glassy phase exhibited no formation of a surface HCA layer, when exposed to \n\nSBF solutions, during thirty days. Only after 5 months immersion it was formed a large plate of \n\ncalcium phosphate. It was observed that the high concentration of Mg ions in SBF, slow down the \n\nformation of amorphous calcium phosphate phase (?-CaP) and greatly retarded the crystallisation of \n\nHCA on the glass surface, as also observed in literature [6,7]. Although some authors underline the \n\ninhibitory effect on bioactivity due to crystallization [1], most of the findings agree that crystal phase \n\nslightly decreases the kinetics of HCA layer formation on the implant surface [8], but there is no loss \n\nin bioactivity, even with crystallinity up to 100 % [9]. The reaction rate observed in the 45S5 glass-\n\nceramic was found to be up to seven times faster than that reported for A/W glass-ceramics with \n\nrespect to the formation of crystalline HCA [9]. Even if the kinetics of apatite formation is slower, \n\nthe preserved bioactivity of the derived glass-ceramics offers new interesting opportunities, since \n\ncrystallized systems are mechanically more reliable than the original parent glass [10]. Moreover, \n\nthe reaction rate of the biomedical device can be adjusted by surface modification [11,12]. \n\nFor the aforementioned reasons, it is important to investigate the proper cleaning methods for the \n\nactivation of a bioactive surface on the G31C-91 glass-ceramic before silanization.  \n\nGlass-ceramic surfaces can then be silanized, as they contain hydroxyl groups which attack and \n\ndisplace the alkoxy groups on the silane thus forming a covalent Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si bond [13]. Silanization \n\nthrough 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) has been used as a process for modification of the \n\nsurface, by forming a monolayer of aminosilane for further bio-functionalization [2]. The active \n\namino groups (\u2013NH2) facilitate the further functionalization and can covalently bond with other \n\nactive groups, such as the carboxyl (\u2013COOH) that can conveniently conjugate with enzyme.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n198 \n\n \n\nX.2. Materials and methods \n\nX.2.1. Glass fabrication \n\nGlass with molar composition 32.7 % CaO, 10.9 % P2O5, 25.4 % SiO2 and 31 % MgO (mol. %) was \n\nproduced by conventional melt quenching technique, as reported elsewhere [14\u201316]. The obtained \n\nbulk was annealed for 30 minutes at 740 \u00baC. Slices samples were prepared with dimensions of 1 x 1 \n\nx 0.5 cm3 polished with sandpaper grain size successively thinner, finished with diamond pastes of \n\n15, 6, 3 and 1\u00b5m particle size.  \n\nThe samples were further heat treated to obtain glass ceramics with 82 % crystallized fraction. Glass-\n\nceramic samples were denominated G31C-91 or \u201cas-prepared\u201d glass-ceramics. After heat treatment \n\nthe samples were polished with diamond pastes of 15, 6, 3 and 1\u00b5m particle size.  \n\nX.2.2. Glass-ceramic surface hydroxyls exposition \n\nThe first step of functionalization process is a cleaning treatment able to promote both the surface \n\nremoval of contaminants and the exposition of reactive hydroxyls. The polished slices have been \n\ncleaned by the following three different methods: \n\n1) Sonification for 5 min in a solution of acetone in H2O (95 vol. %) in order to remove surface \n\ncontaminants and subsequently 3 times for 5 min in distilled water in order to expose reactive \n\ngroups. The samples subjected to this treatment were designated G31C-91-1.  \n\n        \n\n2)  The same procedure as in point 1, followed by further soaking for 1 min in acid solution \n\nH2SO4 at pH = 4 followed by rinsing in distilled water (three times for 5 min each in \n\nultrasonication apparatus). These samples were designated G31C-91-2. \n\n \n\n3) The same procedure as in point 1, followed by further soaking for 3 min in basic solution \n\nNaOH 0.1M followed by rinsing in distilled water (three times for 5 min each in \n\nultrasonication apparatus). These samples were designated G31C-91-3. \n\nThe three methods have been adapted from those described in the literature [17\u201319] and have been \n\ncompared with each other to assess their efficiency in the activation of bioactive glass-ceramic \n\nsurfaces. \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n199 \n\n \n\nX.2.3. Surface silanization \n\nAfter cleaning, all samples (G31C-91-1, -2 and -3) have been silanized with APTES following two \n\nprotocols reported in the literature, depending on the previous cleaning method. \n\n \n\n1S) After cleaning with acetone, the slices were soaked for 6 h in an ethanol solution (95 \n\nvol. %) containing 35 \u00b5L of APTES. After soaking, samples was rinsed in ethanol, thermally \n\ntreated at 100 \u00baC for 1 h, to consolidate the bonding between the silane and the glass surface, \n\nand stored in a dry box. (G31C-91-1S)  \n\n \n\n2S) After cleaning with H2SO4 or NaOH, the silanization was carried out by soaking the \n\nsamples for 3 min in 102 mL of ethanol solution containing 3 mL of APTES. After soaking, \n\neach sample was rinsed in ethanol, thermally treated at 100 \u00baC for 1 h, and stored in a dry \n\nbox. The samples were designated G31C-91-2S and G31C-91-3S, for glass-ceramic surfaces \n\npre-cleaned with H2SO4 and NaOH, respectively. \n\nX.2.4. Characterization of surface modification \n\nThe activated and functionalized glass-ceramic surfaces were investigated using Attenuated Total \n\nReflection (ATR) spectroscopy on a Brucker tensor 27 spectrometer, using a Golden Gate single \n\nreflection diamond ATR system, with no need for sample preparation. All spectra were collected \n\nover a region of 4000\u2013400 cm?1 with 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm?1.  \n\nThe influence of surface modification and functionalization on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic \n\nbehaviour of glass slice was estimated via static contact angle measurements with distilled water at \n\nroom temperature using the sessile drop method, where the angle was determined from the tangent \n\nmade to the drop curvature at the base, through image analysis of the drop profile. All the \n\nmeasurements have been performed on the mirror polished glass-ceramic slice surfaces, before and \n\nafter each cleaning step, and after silanization. The instrument, using a charge coupled device (CCD) \n\ncamera and an image analysis software, was purchased from DataPhysics OCA - Series. The \n\ndistilled water (Milli-Q, Integral; Millipore, USA) droplet volume was 1 ?L, and the contact angle \n\nwas measured 5 s after the drop deposition on the sample surface. The measures were performed on \n\neach glass-ceramics samples in triplicates always using fresh surfaces. For each slice sample, the \n\nreported value is the average of the results obtained on three droplets. \n\n \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n200 \n\n \n\nX.2.5. In vitro bioactivity  \n\nThe in vitro bioactivity was assessed by soaking all samples in a solution of simulated body fluid \n\n(SBF) for periods from 1 day up to 21 days prepared according to the formulation of Kokubo and \n\nTakadama [17]. It was used a constant specimen surface area to solution volume ratio of 0.1 cm?1, \n\npreviously filtered through a Milipore 0.22 ?m system. The samples were placed in a polyethylene \n\nbottle containing SBF solution, and kept in an incubator at 37 \u00baC, without shaking, in accordance to \n\na protocol referred in the literature [18\u201321]. Four samples were used for each immersion time. After \n\nremoval from the SBF, the samples were dried at 60 \u00baC. SEM and XRD were used to analyze the \n\nstructure of the reacted samples, using the conditions described previously. Energy dispersive X-ray \n\nspectroscopy (EDS) was utilized to analyze the elemental composition of the converted layer on the \n\nsurface of the samples immersed in SBF at different time intervals. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis \n\nwas performed using a Rigaku Diffractometer Geigerflex Dmax-C at room temperature with CuK? \n\nradiation (at 40 kV and 40 mA) and a scan speed of 0.02\u00ba s-1.

Surface characterization-FTIR spectroscopy \n\nFig. X.1 shows the FTIR spectra of glass-ceramic slices G31C-91, before and after cleaning with \n\nacetone, basic and acid solutions and the corresponding silane-modified glass-ceramic surfaces. The \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n201 \n\n \n\nrange between 4000 \u2013 1400 cm-1 was chosen because it contains most important peaks of \u2013CH \n\nstretching and functional groups without overlapping with glass characteristic peaks Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si. \n\nThe FTIR spectra of the \u201cas prepared\u201d glass-ceramic G31C-91 reveals at around 3500 cm-1, the \n\nabsorption band of the ?OH bonds and the combination of the Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si stretch (asymmetric) at \n\n1200?970 cm-1 band, Si ? O stretch band at 940?860 cm-1 and the bending Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si at 500 ? 400 \n\ncm-1 [20]. The FTIR also show the additional bands at wavenumbers 560 and 601 cm-1 a peak at 1060 \n\ncm?1 correspondent to the P\u2013O bending  and symmetric stretch vibrations, respectively, due to the \n\npresence of whitlockite [21].  \n\nWith cleaning treatments the bands assigned to P ? O stretching asymmetric decrease intensity. The \n\nnew Si \u2013 O band at ~ 930 cm?1 (with two non-bridging oxygen) was detected in the samples G31C-\n\n91-1 and -2.  \n\nThe cleaned samples G31C-91-1 and G31C-91-2 showed increased transmittance bands of the \n\nvibrational modes due to Si ? O stretch, showing an enrichment in Si \u2013 OH bonds, as proposed.   \n\nTable X.2. FTIR band assignment, a- asymmetric, s- symmetric [20\u201324] \n\n \n\nFor silane-modified glass-ceramic surfaces Fig. X.1b, in the FTIR range between 4000 \u2013 1400 cm-1, \n\nno differences were found in the G31C-91-2S and -3S samples. In the same range, APTES gave to \n\nG31C-91-1 new peaks at ~ 3451 cm\n?1 due to ?NH stretching [24,25]. It can also be observed the \n\npresence of the antisymmetric and symmetric ?CH2 stretching vibration bands 2930 and 2860 cm\n?1, \n\nrespectively, mainly related to the presence of propyl chain added with APTES on the glass-ceramic \n\nWavenumber  \n\n(cm-1) \nVibration mode \n\nWavenumber  \n\n(cm-1) \nVibration mode \n\n3500 Si ?

The vibration at 1484 and 1635 cm?1 correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric \n\n?NH3\n+ deformation modes, indicative of amine group protonation when the samples were exposed \n\nto air. In addition to these modes, NH2 scissor vibration found at 1570 cm\n?1 confirms the presence of \n\nthe terminal groups of the APTES molecules after grafting [26]. Remain spectra, between 1400 and \n\n400 cm-1, Fig. X.1b, include a positive contribution in the spectral range at 1008?1070 cm-1 due to \n\nextra Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si modes correspondent to the presence of siloxane on the surface of G31C-91-1. \n\nThese stretching modes confirm the adsorption of the silane on the modified acetone surface G31C-\n\n91-1. \n\n \nFig. X.1. FTIR spectra of the glass-ceramic surfaces, before and after pre-treatments (a) and \n\nfunctionalization of the correspondent pre-treated samples (b) \n\nThe micrographs of the glass-ceramics before and after the different modifications treatments are \n\npresent in Fig. X.2. With the cleaning treatment, it is observed that the glass matrix dissolves leaving \n\nthe crystalline particles exposed on the surface, as seen in Figs. X.2b, 2c and 2d. The treatments with \n\nacidic or basic solutions caused a very strong dissolution of the glass matrix.  \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n203 \n\n \n\nThe silanization performed on the three different glass surfaces previously cleaned did not modify \n\nsignificantly the surface of the glass.  \n\n \n\nFig. X.2. Microstructure of the as prepared glass-ceramic surface (a), after pre-treatment \n\nwith acetone (b), acid (c) and base (d), and of the correspondent functionalization with \n\nAPTES (e, f and g) \n\nX.3.2. Surface characterization-contact angle analysis \n\nThe contact angle characterization has been used for accessing the presence of \u2013OH on the glass-\n\nceramic surfaces as a result of their chemical modifications, Fig. X.3.  \n\nThe contact angle measurements results as a function of the chemical groups added to the surfaces \n\nare summarized in Table X.3. All washing treatments produced a decrease of the contact angle when \n\ncompared with the as-prepared glass-ceramic slices. The first method (acetone) was more effective \n\nthan the others with a contact angle bellow 8\u00ba, a significant difference when compared with the \n\nreference \u201cas-prepared G31C-91\u201d. As expected, the washing step induced a higher hydrophilicity of \n\nthe glass-ceramic surface, with respect to the as-prepared one, because of the ?OH groups presence, \n\nwhereas silanization enhances its hydrophobicity, due to the configuration of the silane at the surface \n\nwhich is assumed to bend and orient its polar NH2 head toward the surface, driven by the formation \n\nof strong hydrogen bonds with the glass hydroxyl groups. This configuration leaves the ethylene \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n204 \n\n \n\nsequences exposed at the surface, thus providing the assessed hydrophobic character, coherent with \n\nthe literature dealing with alkyl silane modifiers for glass and glass-ceramic surfaces [28\u201331]. \n\nTable X.3.

Surface activation and contamination \n\nremoval by acetone pre-treatment method revealed the best results, where surfaces were free of \n\nhydrophobic contaminants with low contact angles ranging from 4\u00b0 to 8\u00b0, producing a very \n\nhydrophilic surface with low water contact angles, prone to silanization. The surface of silanized \n\nglass should be much more hydrophobic than that of the pre-treated glass. In the present study, the \n\nacetone pre-treated silanized glass surface presented the highest contact angle indicating that \n\nsilanized glass was more hydrophobic and that APTES immobilization on the silanized glass was \n\nsuccessful. Glass surfaces cleaned using H2SO4 and NaOH method, had a mean contact angle value \n\nafter silanization significantly lower than those from acetone method, indicating poor silanization, \n\nconfirming the FTIR results. \n\n \n\nFig. X.3.  Evolution of contact angle measurements before and after glass-ceramic modified \n\nsurfaces \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n205 \n\n \n\nThe role of the different cleaning media on the surface modification of the glasses can be understood \n\nby the capability of the glass to be leached when in contact with an aqueous medium, by the breaking \n\nof an oxygen bridge and the forming of two terminal \u2013OH.  \n\nThe first washing method should be able to activate hydroxyls on the glass-ceramic surface. An acid \n\nenvironment (method 2) can be more effective on the ion exchange step. A basic environment \n\n(method 3) could promote the hydroxylation of the glasses through the catalytic effect of ? OH ions \n\nin the solution. This action probably induced poor hydroxyls exposition reducing silanization as \n\nobserved in Fig. X.1. \n\nThe silane attachment on glass-ceramic surfaces requires the presence of hydroxyl groups for \n\nattachment of the molecules. The ?OH on the surface can react with APTES as the process shown in \n\nFig. X.4b. The silane molecule was first hydrolysed to form reactive silanol groups that further \n\ncondense with surface hydroxyl groups to form Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si bonds or with other hydrolysed silane \n\nmolecule to form Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si cross-linking.  \n\nThe three hydrolysable ethoxy groups of the APTES, allows for multiple points of surface attachment \n\nand polymerization with APTES molecules in both horizontal and vertical directions. \n\nThe pre-cleaning with acetone surface produces significant improvements in the APTES coating. It \n\nhas been reported that the thicker the water layer at silicon oxide surfaces, the more significant the \n\ngrowth of silane at the surface and also the most stable the silane layer can be [27]. \n\n \n\nFig. X.4. APTES molecular structure (a) horizontal (b) vertical and (c) polymerization of \n\nAPTES on a silica substrate [32] \n\nThe acetone treatment G31C-9-1 seems to be the best treatment for surface functionalization and \n\nfurther bioactivity evaluation. The stability and structural alteration of the APTES upon exposure to \n\nSBF was monitored using FTIR, since other studies shown that the silane layer was not stable in \n\nbuffered solutions [35].  \n\n \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n206 \n\n \n\nX.3.3.  Bioactivity studies \n\nThe samples submitted to acetone and the correspondent silanization were used for further bioactivity \n\nand stability studies following the protocol reported by Kokubo [33].  \n\nAfter 1 day immersion in SBF, the FTIR analysis, Fig. X.5, shows the decrease of the intensity \n\nvibration bands of  Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si (stretch and bending),when compared with the G31C-91-1 in Fig. X.1. \n\nThe vibration peaks of the P ? O stretch at 1030 and P?O bend mode at 560 and 600 cm-1 increased \n\nintensity. The bands at 1090 cm-1  assigned to the Si\u2013O\u2013Si asymmetric stretching mode and the band \n\nat 476 cm-1 assigned to the Si \u2013 O \u2013 Si symmetric bending mode tends to decrease it\u2019s intensity with \n\nHCA phase formation.  \n\nFor 14 days soaking, the peaks correspondent to the Si ? O groups, present in the G31C-91-1.1D, \n\ndisappeared with the repolymerization process. Two peaks at 1450 and 1410 cm-1 and a third at 870 \n\ncm-1 increased intensity, due to the incorporation of CO2 from the solution, during the crystallization \n\nof HCA.   \n\nThe increased definition of the peaks related to PO vibrations, P ? O bend (560 and 602 cm-1) and \n\nthe apperence of a P ? O stretch (1050 cm-1) and of a P ? O bending peak at 460 cm-1 was indicative \n\nof an increase in the crystallinity of the precipitated HCA layer [34] for 14 days immersion while in \n\nthe as-prepared glass-ceramic HCA was only detected after 30 days [5]. \n\nTherefore, it can be stated that the developed procedure for altering the surface properties based on \n\nchemically changing the surface of glass-ceramic G31C-91 was effective. \n\nThe vibration modes related with absorbed silane molecules like CH3, CH2 and NH2 were barely \n\nobserved at the first 24 hours but increased intensity after 14 days. The peak at 730 cm-1 could be \n\nassigned to \u2013NH vibration. The corresponding stretching mode of NH at ~3400 cm-1 was too weak \n\nto be discernible in the spectra. The stability of aminosilane layer in SBF was observed. \n\n \n\nFig. X.5. FTIR spectra, after 3 and 14 days immersion in SBF, of the glass\u2013ceramic surface \n\npre-treated in acetone (a) and after silanization (b)  \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n207 \n\n \n\nThe XRD spectra for all investigated samples are shown in Fig. X.6. The \u2018\u2018as-prepared\u2019\u2019 spectra \n\nrepresent the results for crystalline sample. Before immersion in SBF, all samples (with and without \n\nsurface modification) exhibited sharp diffraction peaks, which were identified as diffractions of the \n\nwhitlockite phase ((Ca2.859Mg0.411(PO4)2 according to the card No. 01-087-1582 in the X\u2019Pert \n\nHighScore database).  \n\nAfter 7 days immersion in SBF, the as prepared G31C-91 with an IC of 82 % had no detected \n\nformation of calcium phosphate (Fig. X.6a) showing only a reduction in crystallinity. After 30 days  \n\nin SBF, the sharp diffraction peaks of whitlockite crystalline phase are overlapped by a broad halo, \n\nconsequence of the presence of an amorphous phase, and some incipient peaks of HA were detected. \n\nThe same process was observed in the surface modified samples with a remarkably faster process \n\n(Fig. X.6b and 6c) than in the as-prepared samples (Fig. X.6a). XRD analysis confirmed that the \n\noverlapped of the whitlockite by an amorphous phase was accelerated to 3 days (in surface-modified \n\nsamples), and that after 3 weeks, HA peaks are identified in the surface modified samples. The XRD \n\nspectra suggest that hydroxyapatite did not detach from the glass-ceramic surfaces after prolonged \n\nsoaking times. The surface treatment played a critical role in the acceleration of the reaction.  \n\n \n\nFig. X.6. XRD spectra of samples (a) as-prepared, (b) surface hydroxylation with acetone \n\nand (c) surface-modification with APTES \n\n \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n208 \n\n \n\nThe microstructural evolution, upon immersion in SBF, of the as prepared glass-ceramic and \n\nmodified surfaces with acetone and after silanization is illustrated in Fig. X.7. \n\nAfter soaking in SBF for 1 day, it is clear a faster dissolution of the glass phase in the modified \n\nG31C-91-1compared with the as-prepared sample G31C-91. \n\nAfter 3 weeks, HA-like bulbs were precipitated on the surface of the modified surface (in a ratio \n\nclose to 1.67) in which the crystalline phase was not clear due to an amorphous glass matrix that \n\nembedded the surface, in agreement with the results of XRD analysis (Fig. X.6b and 6c).  \n\n \n\n \nFig. X.7. Surface microstructure of the as prepared glass-ceramic G31C-91 (a, b), acetone \n\nG31C-91-1 (c, d), and acetone + silane G31C-91-1S (e, f) samples after immersion in \n\nSBF for 1 day (a, c and e) and 3 weeks (b, d and f) \n\nThe surface modification plays a key role in speeding up the formation of HCA layer. The reasons \n\nfor this behaviour are the faster dissolution of the glass phase compared with the as prepared sample. \n\nIn the acetone treated surface without APTES (Fig. X.7c), the glass matrix dissolves faster, such that \n\nthe crystalline particles are exposed on the surface. When modified with APTES (Fig. X.7e), the \n\nsurface is covered by a layer of APTES molecules, which reduces the dissolution rates of the glass \n\nmatrix.  \n\nPreferential dissolution is observed in the gaps between the glass matrix and crystalline particles. \n\nThis narrow interstices seems to be attack by the SBF solution, forming cavities indorsing the \n\nwhitlockite crystals to detached from the matrix, leaving pores (Fig. X.7a, 7c) in the glass matrix.  \n\nAs confirmed by XRD, the establishment of the HA is not observed in the 3 weeks immersion in \n\nSBF of the as-prepared glass-ceramic, G31C-91. However, in the acetone-treated and silane surface-\n\nmodified samples, the HA formed at almost the same rate, since silanization does not significantly \n\nalter material reactivity.  \n\n\n\nX \u2013 Surface modification of Si-Ca-P-Mg glass-ceramic: a bioactivity study \n\n \n\n209 \n\n \n\nThe stability of aminosilane, with a dense surface free amine functional group, is crucial for tissue \n\nengineering applications. Currently, APTES is the most widely used aminosaline in the field but it \n\ncan self-polymerize in humid environments and result in a heterogeneous surface [31,35]. \n\nInterestingly, our FTIR analysis did not confirmed this result on the surface of the glass-ceramics \n\nusing the acetone cleaning treatment. \n\nX.4. Conclusion \n\nSurface modification of the Si-Ca-P-Mg based glass-ceramic monolithic was carried out by different \n\ncleaning methods and further chemical functionalization by reaction with the APTES.  The washing \n\ntreatment is necessary to induce surface activation by free ?OH exposition. The results of this study \n\nindicate that the acetone treatment during the surface-modification process must be considered in the \n\nglass\u2013ceramic bioactivity improvement. Both acetone aqueous treatment and APTES molecules \n\nsurface-functionalization process expedites the subsequent bioreaction of the glass-ceramics in SBF \n\nand must be considered in the design of glass-ceramic scaffolds with tailored bioactivity and \n\nbiodegradability. The surface-functionalized samples are ready for protein immobilization and can \n\nbe used to fabricate glass-ceramic scaffolds for protein release studies. \n\nReferences  \n\n[1] P. Li, Q.

General Conclusions \n\nThe main goal of the present thesis was to investigate the fabrication, mechanical properties and \n\nin vitro performance of bioactive glass and glass-ceramic scaffolds from compositions of the Si?\n\nCa?P?Na?Mg system using the salt sintering process for applications in bone regeneration. \n\nThe sintering behavior of the base 3CaO.P2O5-MgO-SiO2 system glass was investigated. The \n\nglass powder compacts can be densified through viscous sintering, without the present of \n\ncrystalline phases. Near full densification was reached by a small decrease of the glass particle \n\nsize from 6.8 ?m to 3.5 ?m, decreasing the degree of particle orientation and shrinkage anisotropy. \n\nIn the initial stage of the densification the activation energies of sintering, Es, were comparable \n\nfor both particle size distributions.  \n\nA complex crystallization process was observed in the same glass system, with associated \n\nactivation energies reflecting the change of behaviour during in-situ crystal precipitation. \n\nWhitlockite, forsterite and enstatite were the crystalline phases forming on heat treating the glass. \n\nIt was found that the crystallization process was affected by the fraction of crystallization (x), \n\ngiving rise to decreasing activation energy values, Ec(x), with the increase of x, for the first \n\ncrystalline phase whitlockite. As the crystallization proceeds, and thus the crystallized fraction \n\nincreases, the Avrami exponent increased, corresponding to a crystallization with one-\n\ndimensional growth associated to a bulk nucleation of the whitlockite phase, in agreement with \n\nthe long needles observed by SEM. \n\nDuring the scaffold processing a reaction involving the glass network and the alkaline salt was \n\nproposed, in which, a structural disruption of the glass surfaces takes place, with formation of \n\nchlorine gas that causes an expansion phenomenon responsible for the increase of the SSA by the \n\nwrinkling of the surfaces and the creation of preferential crystallization sites at the surface. This \n\nphenomenon of salt\u2013glass reaction is of high technological interest for the production of glass \n\nbased scaffolds for many purposes including bone related biomedical applications where the \n\nexceptional surface area available after sintering can provide a high contact surface with the \n\nsurrounding biological system. \n\n\n\nXI \u2013 General Conclusions &amp; Final Remarks \n\n \n\n216 \n\n \n\nThe base glass composition in the 3.CaO.P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO system was changed by Na2O \n\naddition, aiming to obtain glass melts of controlled viscosity and workability to enlarge the \n\n\u201cworking window\u201d for sintering. A small addition of Na2O to the 3.CaO.P2O5 ? SiO2 ? MgO \n\nsystem was crucial to enhance the densification behaviour and mechanical strength. The partial \n\nreplacement of MgO by Na2O enhanced the trend towards depolymerisation, reflected by an \n\nincrease in Q2 at the expense of Q3 and Q4 units, as supported by MAS-NMR spectra. The selected \n\nglass systems allow variation of properties, such as degradation tendency through minor chemical \n\nadjustments and adequate heat treatments. \n\nThe mechanical reliability of bioactive glass scaffolds remain as limiting factors for applications \n\nin loaded bone repair. The crystallization was proposed for improving the toughness of bioactive \n\nglass scaffolds. Besides the study of the scaffold processing, the understanding of the effect of \n\ncrystallization on the mechanical behaviour and surface reactivity in acellular medium and in cell \n\ncultures allowed assessing the best compromise in the fabricated scaffolds. The crystallization of \n\nglass improved the mechanical properties of the obtained glass-ceramics scaffolds but it \n\ncompromised their surface chemical reactivity hindering bioactivity, especially on bulk samples. \n\nTo counterbalance this drawback, surface functionalization of the glass-ceramics appears as a \n\npromising solution. Only after 3 weeks, crystalline hydroxyapatite peaks were identified in the \n\nsurface of glass-ceramic modified samples while the as prepared glass-ceramic had no detected \n\nformation of hydroxiapatite up to 5 months. \n\nThis possibility seems to be of major importance not only for the manufacturing of implant \n\nmaterials with resorption rates matching the growth rates of bone, but also for satisfying results \n\nin cell experiments and tissue engineering having in mind that the optimization of the degradation \n\nrate facilitates cell proliferation and improved biocompatibility. \n\nXI.2. Directions for Future Research \n\nFor bone regeneration, the biggest challenge is to fabricate scaffolds with suitable mechanical \n\nproperties capable of load transmission, induction of vascularisation and tailored degradability. \n\nFuture research is needed to broaden the choice of glass compositions, thermal treatments and \n\nporogen so that scaffolds can be tailored to distinctive applications. \n\nFurthermore, another desirable modification to these scaffolds is the incorporation of bioactive \n\nsubstances, like growth factors. However, once these scaffolds undergo fast degradation rates we \n\nbelieved that a significant higher kinetic release of the growth factors will be generated. Therefore \n\nit seems essential to develop the adequate techniques to retain an appropriated amount of the \n\nincorporated factors for a later release. \n\n\n\nXI \u2013 General Conclusions &amp; Final Remarks \n\n \n\n217 \n\n \n\nA focus of future work should be the creation of strong and tough bioactive glass-ceramic \n\nscaffolds and their evaluation in loaded and non-loaded bone defect sites in animal models. \n\nMoreover, the application of surface modification and use of protein adsorption provide a scope \n\nof tailoring the scaffold biocompatibility. \n\nBased on the biodegradable and biocompatibility results there would be room for simulating the \n\ndegradation and resorption kinetic of the process and based on these factors, to manufacture \n\nscaffolds which could fulfil the desired function properly."}]}}}
