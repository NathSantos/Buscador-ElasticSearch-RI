Recently, literature suggests that stability can only be fully grasped if food molecular \n\ndynamics and structure are taken into consideration, i.e. an appropriate understanding of the \n\nbehaviour of food products requires knowledge of its composition, structure and molecular \n\ndynamics, through the three-dimensional arrangement of the various structural elements and \n\ntheir interactions.  \n\nFood systems behaviour is strongly dependent on the water molecular dynamics. \n\nUnderstanding changes in water location and mobility represents a significant step in food \n\nstability knowledge, once that water \u201cavailability\u201d profoundly affects the chemical, physical and \n\nmicrobiological quality of foods.  \n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), through the analysis of nuclear magnetisation \n\nrelaxation times, has been presented as a powerful technique to investigate water dynamics \n\nand physical structures of foods. It provides information on molecular dynamics of different \n\ncomponents in complex systems. The application of this technique may be very useful in \n\npredicting food systems physicochemical changes, namely texture, viscosity or water \n\nmigration. \n\nThe research leading to this thesis focused on two main food systems: i) films from \n\nbiological sources, for their interest as model matrices and potential for food industry; and ii) \n\nfresh-cut fruit, due to its complexity and significance in food markets.  \n\nFilms from biological sources, particularly chitosan, present several applications \n\nincluding biodegradable packaging and edible coatings for shelf-life extension. As model food \n\nsystems, films from biological sources are partially crystalline, partially amorphous, and easily \n\nreproducible materials. From a fundamental perspective, foods are mainly edible and \n\ndigestible biopolymers that are also partially crystalline/partially amorphous. Despite of the \n\nwealth of information on literature, a systematic approach to understand the contribution of film \n\nforming solutions (FFS) on chitosan films physical properties, as well as the knowledge on its \n\nmolecular dynamics to such properties, are still uncommon. In this thesis, the relevance of \n\nFFS composition on films properties is highlighted through the monitoring of solutions with \n\ndifferent polymer/plasticiser ratios. Also the molecular dynamics, evaluated through NMR \n\nmethodology, was analysed and compared with the films physical properties. Results \n\ndemonstrated the influence of solutions polymer/plasticiser concentrations on both thermo-\n\nmechanical and water related properties. Chitosan concentration in solutions affected \n\nconsistency coefficient, and this was related with differences in films water retention and \n\nstructure. Plasticiser quantities used in FFS are responsible for films compositions, while \n\npolymer/plasticiser ratio determined the thickness and thus the structure of the films. NMR \n\nallows understanding the films molecular rearrangement, demonstrating that water is also an \n\n\n\nABSTRACT \n\n \n\nVI \n\n \n\nimportant component in these matrices and performs differently when compared with the \n\nplasticiser. A relationship between water and plasticiser dynamics and films macroscopic \n\nproperties was also observed. \n\nFruits are high water content products with a complex cellular structure, where water \n\ncan be present in both intra and extra cellular spaces. Fresh-cut fruit, due to processing, has \n\nhigh metabolic rates with faster physiological and biochemical changes and microbial \n\ndegradation, which results in product\u2019s colour and texture alterations. The second part of this \n\nthesis focused on fresh-cut fruits, pear and melon, which were chosen for their significantly \n\ndifferent composition and structure. Fresh-cut fruit was monitored during 7 days of refrigerated \n\nstorage conditions. Relevant quality parameters, such as colour and firmness, were analysed. \n\nWater activity (aw) and water molecular dynamics (T2), measured by a NMR technique, were \n\nalso assessed throughout storage. Results demonstrated that processing and storage affected \n\nquality parameters, as was expected, but also system\u2019s water molecular dynamics. \n\nThroughout storage, it was possible to find relationships between the molecular dynamics and \n\nthe quality parameters. These relationships were different for the two studied fruits, and the \n\nrole of microstructure on food stability could be observed. \n\nThese studies highlight the significance and impact of molecular dynamics on physical \n\nproperties and stability of foods, and also the usefulness of NMR methodology as a tool to \n\nevaluate food physical properties and stability. Therefore, NMR could provide a novel \n\ninstrument to improve the knowledge of food systems, even when complex. \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\n \n\nEdible films; Fresh-cut fruit; Quality parameters; Physical properties; Microstructure; Molecular \n\ndynamics;  Storage stability; NMR studies \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nVII \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n O controlo das propriedades f\u00edsicas e da estabilidade dos alimentos \u00e9 requisito \n\nessencial para o fornecimento de produtos seguros e saud\u00e1veis aos consumidores. Por este \n\nmotivo, desde h\u00e1 muito tempo que o tema tem despertado a aten\u00e7\u00e3o e a curiosidade dos \n\ncientistas que trabalham na \u00e1rea alimentar. \n\n A literatura tem vindo a sugerir que as propriedades f\u00edsicas e a estabilidade s\u00f3 podem \n\nser plenamente compreendidas se a din\u00e2mica molecular e a estrutura dos alimentos for tida \n\nem considera\u00e7\u00e3o; ou seja, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio um conhecimento da composi\u00e7\u00e3o, da estrutura e da \n\ndin\u00e2mica molecular dos sistemas alimentares, entendendo o arranjo tridimensional dos v\u00e1rios \n\nelementos estruturais e das suas interac\u00e7\u00f5es.  \n\n No caso particular dos alimentos, a din\u00e2mica molecular da \u00e1gua desempenha um \n\npapel fundamental no seu comportamento. A \u201cdisponibilidade\u201d da \u00e1gua influencia \n\nprofundamente a qualidade qu\u00edmica, f\u00edsica e microbiol\u00f3gica dos sistemas alimentares. A \n\ncompreens\u00e3o das altera\u00e7\u00f5es na localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e mobilidade da \u00e1gua do sistema representa um \n\npasso significativo no conhecimento dos mecanismos que est\u00e3o associados \u00e0s reac\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos alimentos. \n\n A resson\u00e2ncia magn\u00e9tica nuclear (RMN), atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise dos tempos de relaxa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o nuclear, tem sido considerada uma poderosa t\u00e9cnica para investigar a \n\ndin\u00e2mica da \u00e1gua e avaliar estruturas f\u00edsicas em sistemas complexos como os alimentos. A \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o desta t\u00e9cnica pode ser muito \u00fatil na previs\u00e3o de altera\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas como a \n\ntextura, a viscosidade ou a migra\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua na matriz. \n\n Esta tese considerou dois sistemas alimentares distintos: (i) filmes de origem \n\nbiol\u00f3gica, pelo seu interesse como matrizes modelo e potencial para a ind\u00fastria alimentar; e \n\n(ii) fruta minimamente processada, pela sua complexidade e reconhecida import\u00e2ncia \n\necon\u00f3mica nos mercados de alimentos. \n\n Os filmes com origem biol\u00f3gica, neste caso espec\u00edfico provenientes do quitosano, \n\npossuem v\u00e1rias aplica\u00e7\u00f5es industriais como \u00e9 o caso das embalagens ou revestimentos \n\ncomest\u00edveis, que t\u00eam como objectivo prolongar a vida \u00fatil dos produtos. Como modelo para \n\nsistemas alimentares mais complexos t\u00eam as vantagens de: serem facilmente reprodut\u00edveis; e \n\ntal como os alimentos, de um ponto de vista fundamental podem ser considerados \n\nbiopol\u00edmeros comest\u00edveis parcialmente cristalinos, e parcialmente amorfos. Apesar da vasta \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o que existe na literatura sobre as propriedades f\u00edsicas dos filmes de quitosano, \n\numa abordagem sistem\u00e1tica para a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o da contribui\u00e7\u00e3o das solu\u00e7\u00f5es formadoras do \n\nfilme, assim como a influ\u00eancia da din\u00e2mica molecular nessas propriedades, revela-se ainda \n\nnecess\u00e1ria. Nesta tese, a import\u00e2ncia da composi\u00e7\u00e3o das solu\u00e7\u00f5es formadoras nas \n\npropriedades dos filmes \u00e9 real\u00e7ada atrav\u00e9s da monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de solu\u00e7\u00f5es formadoras com \n\ndiferentes propor\u00e7\u00f5es pol\u00edmero/plasticizante. A import\u00e2ncia destas solu\u00e7\u00f5es foi avaliada \n\n\n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nVIII \n\n \n\ntamb\u00e9m nas altera\u00e7\u00f5es das propriedades termomec\u00e2nicas dos filmes assim como a sua \n\ninflu\u00eancia na din\u00e2mica molecular dos mesmos (atrav\u00e9s de t\u00e9cnicas de RMN).  \n\n Os resultados demonstram que a composi\u00e7\u00e3o das solu\u00e7\u00f5es formadoras influenciou as \n\npropriedades mec\u00e2nicas e t\u00e9rmicas dos filmes, bem como as propriedades relacionadas com \n\na \u00e1gua (atividade, solubilidade, permeabilidade e a din\u00e2mica molecular). A concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nquitosano afetou o coeficiente de consist\u00eancia das solu\u00e7\u00f5es formadoras, o que pode ser \n\nrelacionado com diferen\u00e7as na estrutura e na reten\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua dos filmes. Por outro lado, a \n\nquantidade de plasticizante usado na prepara\u00e7\u00e3o das solu\u00e7\u00f5es formadoras \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel \n\npela composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos filmes, enquanto a raz\u00e3o pol\u00edmero/plasticizante determinou a espessura, \n\nlogo a estrutura dos filmes. Atrav\u00e9s dos estudos de RMN foi poss\u00edvel compreender o rearranjo \n\nmolecular dos filmes, demonstrando o papel importante que a \u00e1gua, como componente, \n\ndesempenha neste tipo de matrizes, revelando diferen\u00e7as de comportamento entre esta e o \n\nplasticizante. Estes resultados revelaram ainda que existe uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a din\u00e2mica \n\nmolecular quer da \u00e1gua quer do plasticizante nos filmes com as propriedades macrosc\u00f3picas \n\ndos mesmos. \n\n As frutas s\u00e3o alimentos com uma estrutura celular muito complexa, ricos em \u00e1gua que \n\npode estar presente quer nos espa\u00e7os intracelulares, quer nos extracelulares. As frutas, \n\nminimamente processadas, devido ao ferimento a que s\u00e3o sujeitas, tem altas taxas \n\nmetab\u00f3licas que provocam r\u00e1pidas altera\u00e7\u00f5es fisiol\u00f3gicas, bioqu\u00edmicas e de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmicrobianas, resultando, por exemplo, em perda de cor e textura. A segunda parte desta tese \n\ndedica-se ao estudo de p\u00eara e mel\u00e3o minimamente processados. Estas frutas s\u00e3o muito \n\ndiferentes no que diz respeito \u00e0 estrutura. As amostras foram estudadas durante 7 dias de \n\narmazenamento em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de refrigera\u00e7\u00e3o. Foram avaliados alguns dos par\u00e2metros de \n\nqualidade mais relevantes, como \u00e9 o caso da cor e da textura. A atividade da \u00e1gua (aw) e a \n\ndin\u00e2mica molecular da \u00e1gua (T2), analisada atrav\u00e9s de uma t\u00e9cnica de RMN, foram tamb\u00e9m \n\nmonitorizadas durante o tempo de armazenamento. Os resultados mostram que quer o \n\nprocessamento quer o tempo de armazenamento afetaram os par\u00e2metros de qualidade, bem \n\ncomo a din\u00e2mica da \u00e1gua nos sistemas. Observou-se ainda uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre os par\u00e2metros \n\nde qualidade e os valores da din\u00e2mica da \u00e1gua. Esta rela\u00e7\u00e3o foi diferente para os dois frutos \n\nestudados, real\u00e7ando o papel da estrutura na estabilidade dos alimentos. \n\n Nesta tese evidencia-se o interesse e a utilidade dos estudos de din\u00e2mica molecular, \n\nutilizando a t\u00e9cnica de RMN como ferramenta na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades f\u00edsicas e da \n\nestabilidade de sistemas alimentares e complexos. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave \n\nBiofilmes; Fruta minimamente processada; Par\u00e2metros de qualidade; Propriedades f\u00edsicas; \n\nMicroestrutura; Din\u00e2mica molecular; Estabilidade durante armazenamento; Estudos de NMR \n\n \n\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n \n\n \n\nIX \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\n \n\nThis PhD program and dissertation were made possible due to the contribution \n\nof institutions and special persons, to whom I would like to express my gratitude: \n\n \n\nTo Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (Portugal) for my PhD grant \n\n(SFRH/ BD / 62176 / 2009); \n\nTo Escola Superior de Biotecnologia of Universidade Cat\u00f3lica Portuguesa for \n\nthe opportunity and excellent research conditions made available for me as a PhD \n\nstudent; \n\nMy word of appreciation goes to my supervisor Professor Cristina L.M.

Stability is a critical parameter for \n\nboth consumers and industry. Concerning consumers, it assures safety, nutritional \n\nand sensorial quality of food products. For industry, stability allows maximising shelf-\n\nlife: minimising waste along the distribution chain, increasing profit and reducing the \n\nenvironmental impact. \n\nFor a long time scientists believed that aw was the determinant parameter in \n\nfood stability and physical properties. This concept was challenged with the \n\nrevolutionary approach to the study of food systems using the glass transition \n\nconcept. Recently, scientific research suggests that water molecular dynamics is a \n\nfundamental approach to fully attain food physical properties and stability. Food water \n\ncontent, location and interactions with other components are critical in microbial \n\ngrowth, degradation reactions and sensorial aspects. \n\nThis dissertation aims to contribute at clarifying the influence of systems \n\nmolecular dynamics, with particular relevance on water molecular dynamics. Thus, \n\nthis project addresses studies on matrices with different complexities, i.e. films from \n\nbiological sources, and fruits as more complex high water content products. Micro and \n\nmacroscopic behaviour will be analysed, by means of assessing texture, dynamic \n\nlinear viscoelastic behaviour and thermodynamic transitions. Molecular mobility will be \n\nevaluated by means of NMR. \n\n \n\n \n\nOutline of dissertation structure \n\nThis dissertation is divided into 4 main parts, each with a variable number of \n\nchapters. Figure 0.1 presents schematically the dissertation structure, illustrating the \n\nrelationships between each subject. \n\n\n\nSCOPE AND OUTLINE \n\n \n\n \n\nXVIII \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 0.1 Schematic structure of the dissertation. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSCOPE AND OUTLINE \n\n \n\n \n\nXIX \n\n \n\nPart I, the introductory section, is composed by chapter 1 dedicated to a \n\nreview of the critical factors affecting the physical properties and stability of food \n\nsystems, identifying water as a critical component, considered as the main factor in \n\nsystems dynamics.  \n\n \n\nIn Part II, studies on the relationship between composition, microstructure, \n\nfunctional properties and molecular dynamics of simple food matrices were \n\ndeveloped. This part was divided into 3 chapters. Films from biological sources were \n\nchosen, in particular chitosan films. Chitosan, a natural polysaccharide obtained by \n\ndeacetylation of chitin, is an excellent edible film component due to its film-forming \n\ncapacity, good mechanical and barrier properties and antimicrobial activity. Physical \n\nbehaviour is vital for proper film functionality and is also critical for product and \n\nprocess design. Critical physical properties are water, gas and other molecules \n\ndiffusion through the film and thermal-mechanical properties. Studies on the \n\nformulation and processing effects on chitosan films physical behaviour have been \n\nlong presented in the literature. However, results on molecular mobility in films are \n\nless common. The novelty of this work is that gathering such data was carried using a \n\nsystematic approach, linking physical properties with NMR results on molecular \n\nmobility. In chapter 2, the FFS polymer/plasticisant ratio was analysed in order to \n\ndescribe its effect on films properties. In both chapters 3 and 4, data on molecular \n\nmobility of the films, previously characterised, was measured, by means of NMR. \n\nWater related properties, in chapter 3, and physical properties, in chapter 4, were \n\ncompared with the molecular dynamics measurements. \n\n \n\nPart III is dedicated to the study of fresh-cut fruit, along refrigerated storage \n\ntime. Fruits are high water content products. Due to their cellular structure, water can \n\nbe presented in both intra and extra cellular spaces. This influences the water \n\n\n\nSCOPE AND OUTLINE \n\n \n\n \n\nXX \n\n \n\ndynamics. Specifically, fresh-cut fruits are interesting matrices for these studies, since \n\nit is well known that fruits processing promotes a faster physiological deterioration, \n\nbiochemical changes and microbial degradation, which may result in degradation of \n\noverall perceived quality. The observed chemical and physical changes could \n\ncertainly be clarified by systems molecular dynamics and structure alterations, and \n\nmonitoring with the support of NMR techniques. The purpose of this part of the thesis \n\nwas to relate, for fresh-cut melon and pear, NMR parameters with some of the most \n\nimportant quality parameters, i.e. colour, softening rate and aw. Chapter 5 - section A \n\nfocuses on fresh-cut melon, while chapter 5 - section B is about fresh-cut pear. Melon \n\nand pear represent important segments in the world of fruit market. However, the \n\nbiochemical bases for colour and firmness changes, for example, are completely \n\ndifferent, as well as their structures. \n\n \n\nFinally, conclusions and suggestions for further work, based on critical \n\nquestions arising from this dissertation, are presented in chapter 6 (Part IV). \n\n \n\n \n\nScientific outputs of dissertation \n\n \n\nThe work reported in this dissertation has been already subjected to \n\ninternational peer reviewing via publication in international referred journals as \n\nindicated by the list below. Furthermore, the research work has been presented to the \n\nscientific community in both national and international meetings. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSCOPE AND OUTLINE \n\n \n\n \n\nXXI \n\n \n\n \n\nPublications \n\n \n\nRefereed in international scientific publications \n\n \n\nJoana F.

Overall molecular dynamics concept \n\n Molecular dynamics has been pointed as the actual most promising parameter \n\nfor characterising multi-component systems. Analysis of systems at a molecular scale \n\nhas been demonstrated to be an useful methodology for investigating complex \n\ngeometries and molecules, as well as study structural and dynamic properties (Wang \n\nand Liapis, 2012). \n\n Molecular dynamics involves, at a microscopic level, the displacement of \n\nreactants towards with other within the food matrix, which promote chemical reactions. \n\nMacroscopically, molecular dynamics can be related to the viscosity of the material, \n\nwhich in turn controls the flow properties, structure collapse, mechanical properties, \n\nand thus the product texture (Roudaut et al., 2004).  \n\n It is generally accepted that the knowledge of molecular dynamics is \n\ndeterminant for assessing physico-chemical and microbiological stability of food \n\nsystems (Lin et al., 2006; Roudaut et al., 2004), and is quite dependent on \n\ncomposition and matrices microstructure.  \n\n Food stability is a critical parameter for different stakeholders. Concerning \n\nconsumers, stability assures safety, nutritional and sensorial quality of food products \n\nand answers to the increasing demand for a diversity of ready-to-eat food with fresh \n\nappearance and health-promoting properties (Olsen et al., 2010). For industry, \n\nstability allows maximizing shelf-life: minimising waste along the distribution chain, \n\nincreasing profit, and reducing the environmental impact (Labuza et al., 1972; \n\nRahman, 2006, 2010; Ubbink and Kruger, 2006).  \n\n Food physical stability is assessed by shelf-life changes of mechanical, \n\nthermal, or surface properties, which are often related with food product\u2019s quality, \n\nprocessing behaviour or development of novel food products and processes (Berk, \n\n2013; Lewicki, 2004). Physicall state is directly affected and responsible for the \n\nmolecular dynamics of a matrix (Ludescher et al., 2001; Quintas et al., 2010). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n It is possible to observe in Figure 1.1 a simplified scheme of how molecular \n\ndynamics covers several concepts related to food properties and stability, being a key \n\nand linking factor between all aspects involved in food systems assessment, including \n\nfood structure/microstructure. The better understanding of these factors and \n\nrelationship between them are essential for controlling degradation reaction rates and \n\nmaintaining food integrity (Rahman, 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Schematic representation of molecular dynamics as a key factor for food physical \n\nproperties and stability assessment. \n\n \n\n Food systems are complex mixtures of water, biopolymers (proteins and \n\npolysaccharides), low-molecular weight ingredients (minerals, sugars, surfactants, \n\netc.), and colloid particles (oil droplets or air bubbles). The molecular dynamics \n\nbetween these different components reflects on the stability of such systems, \n\ndetermining the physical state, microstructure and composition, which impacts on food \n\ncharacteristics (Roos, 1995). Water, as one of the most important food constituents \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\nand its interactions with other food ingredients, controls both thermodynamic and \n\ndynamic properties of all aqueous elements (Roudaut et al., 2004). These interactions \n\naffect mainly appearance and sensory attributes (texture/firmness) (Palzer, 2010; \n\nToivonen and Brummel, 2008; Watada and Qi, 1999), nutrient quality (Watada and Qi, \n\n1999), and the microbiological load (Kou et al., 1999). The extensions of the reactions \n\nbetween food constituents, usually associated with metabolic processes, are \n\nresponsible for the degradation of quality, safety and nutritional attributes.  \n\nAlthough molecular dynamics has been considered an useful methodology for \n\ninvestigating complex systems (geometries and molecules) (Wang and Liapis, 2012) \n\nand the degradation reactions extension, a high number of studies have been focused \n\non chemically pure or homogeneous materials, such as proteins or polysaccharides, \n\ninstead of food systems. The data for \u201cpure and simple\u201d systems cannot be \n\nextrapolated when considering food systems, since it is necessary to take into \n\naccount the heterogeneity of the systems, as well as their interactions with water \n\n(Roudaut et al., 2004). Moreover, it is important to consider the system\u2019s \n\nmicrostructure, to understand the spatial and molecular distribution of water within its \n\nfood matrix environment and determine if water is already bound or free for metabolic \n\nreactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. Aspects of water molecular dynamics \n\nWater is the most important solvent, dispersion medium and plasticiser in \n\nbiological and food systems (Matveeva et al., 2000). It affects reactions, can be a \n\nsubstrate and a product of reactions, and is involved in nutrient transport and \n\ndissolution of salts and other solutes. It establishes pH, acts as a polymer plasticiser \n\nand modulates viscosity, osmotic pressure, etc. (Vittadini et al., 2005). Specifically, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\nthe state of water in food influences physical properties, such as rheological, \n\nelectrical, optical, thermal or mass transfer (Lewicki, 2004). \n\nFor long, water has been considered as one of the most important food \n\ncomponents in impacting food physicochemical and microbiological attributes, shelf-\n\nlife and deteriorative changes (Hills et al., 1996a; Labuza, 1977; Labuza et al., 1972; \n\nLewicki, 2004; Mathlouthi, 2001; Pittia and Sacchetti, 2008; Rahman, 2010; Sablani et \n\nal., 2007; Slade and Levine, 1991). Therefore, determination of water content is one \n\nof the most frequent analyses in the food industry laboratories (Mathlouthi, 2001). \n\nWater content of food systems normally ranges from 80-95%, for high moisture foods, \n\nto a percentage close to zero in semi-dry and dry foods (Anese et al., 1996; Pittia and \n\nSacchetti, 2008). However, various foods with the same water content differ in stability \n\n(Kou et al., 1999), which demonstrates that the sole value of \u201cwater content\u201d in a food \n\ndoes not inform about the nature of water (Fennema, 1996; Kou et al., 1999; \n\nMathlouthi, 2001). In fact, in a food matrix, water molecules can be \u201cbound\u201d to other \n\nconstituents or \u201cfree\u201d to participate in degradation reactions (Mathlouthi, 2001).  \n\nThe knowledge of each of these fractions is important, specifically because \n\navailable water, its location, and the interactions with the other food components (like \n\nproteins and polysaccharides) are responsible for the physicochemical and \n\nmicrobiological properties and stability of foods (Matveeva et al., 2000; Sablani et al., \n\n2007). As such, besides water content in a food material, it is important to understand \n\nthe water state and dynamics for a proper comprehension of properties and stability of \n\nfood products. \n\nWater mobility/dynamics can thus be described as a manifesto of how \u201cfreely\u201d \n\nwater molecules can participate in reactions or how easily water molecules diffuse to \n\nthe reaction sites to participate in reactions (Ruan and Chen, 1998). Presence of \n\nmolecules of different molecular weight and solubility in water can have a profound \n\ninfluence on water mobility/dynamics, as this is dependent on the physicochemical \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\nproperties of other nonaqueous food constituents and their interactions with water and \n\namong themselves (Ruan and Chen, 1998; Vittadini et al., 2003). \n\nDifferent parameters have been used in the literature to describe water \n\ndynamics in the food systems and its repercussion in stability: like water activity (aw), \n\nglass transition temperature (Tg) or water relaxation time (T2). These concepts are \n\ndetailed in the next sub-sections.  \n\n \n\n 1.2.1. Water activity concept and shortcomings \n\nWater activity concept was introduced in middle of 20\nth\n century as a critical \n\nparameter for estimating food stability (Rahman, 2010), and has been one of the most \n\nwidely used to determine food\u2019s water availability (Kou et al., 1999). For a long time, \n\naw was regarded as the most important parameter controlling the behaviour of foods \n\nduring processing and storage, with particular emphasis on its effects on reaction \n\ndegradation rates (Anese et al., 1996; Labuza, 1977; Maltini et al., 2003; Sablani et \n\nal., 2007). This parameter has been used thoroughly as the indicator  for microbial \n\ngrowth and microbial stability of a food system (Vittadini and Chinachoti, 2003). Also, \n\nwith respect to most of degradation reactions of a chemical, enzymatic, or physical \n\nnature, such as lipid oxidation, non-enzymatic and enzymatic activities, and the \n\ntexture/mouthfeel of foods following production, water activity is currently used as an \n\nimportant parameter (Maltini et al., 2003; Sablani et al., 2007; Slade and Levine, \n\n1991). \n\nDespite of the irrefutable significance of aw for food science and engineering, \n\nthe limitations of this analysis are, actually, evident. Water activity is a thermodynamic \n\nmeasure of the chemical potential of water in the system, assuming that food is in \n\nequilibrium with the surrounding atmosphere (Lewicki, 2004). However, it is well \n\nknown that most foods are not in the state of equilibrium (Hills et al., 1996a; Rahman, \n\n2006). Water activity measurements may not provide, for example, the relationship of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nthe evolution of the structural changes of the food material with the changes of the \n\nwater-macromolecules and water-water interactions that occur during food shelf-life \n\n(Wang and Liapis, 2012). Studies have stressed that under many common \n\ncircumstances, the thermodynamics activity of water is far less relevant to processing \n\nand storage than structure-related properties, which can restrict the mobility and \n\ndiffusion of the reactants (Anese et al., 1996; Slade and Levine, 1991).  \n\nMoreover, the aw analysis does not consider microstructure nor the possibility \n\nthat there may be local regions differing in water content and presumably in water \n\navailability (Hills et al., 1996a). This can be important for microbiological stability, \n\nsince some authors (Hills et al., 1996b; Hills et al., 1997; Vittadini et al., 2005) \n\ndemonstrated that microorganisms are sensitive to the local properties of the system, \n\ni.e. local water activity, translational motions and microstructure, and not to the bulk \n\nwater activity. Some authors also showed that microbial response in a solution is \n\nmore dependent on the solute used to control aw values than on aw itself (Chirife and \n\nBuera, 1994; Vittadini and Chinachoti, 2003), showing the importance of solute \n\ninteraction. Water activity defined as a relative vapour pressure, reflects only the \n\nsurface properties of a system and not necessarily the molecular dynamics that takes \n\nplace in its interior (Vittadini et al., 2005). Furthermore, it has been reported that \n\nsolutions with the same water activity can present dramatic differences in the system\u2019s \n\n\u201ckinetics\u201d (here assessed by viscosity) (Anese et al., 1996; Maltini et al., 2003) (see \n\nFigure 1.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 Viscosity versus water activity (aw) of model solutions produced with different \n\nsolutes (Anese et al., 1996). \n\n \n\n 1.2.2. Glass transition temperature \n\nThe glass transition temperature (Tg) was introduced in the early 1980\u2019s aiming \n\nat finding a new parameter that would be able to assess food stability and overcome \n\nthe limitations of aw. This concept has been extensively applied, giving way to a new \n\nimportant area of research and application: food material science (Angel, 1996; \n\nRahman, 2006; Roos, 1995; Slade and Levine, 1995). Essentially, this approach \n\n\u201csimplifies\u201d the foods as partially crystalline partially amorphous materials. The \n\namorphous part is in a metastable state, which is very sensitive to changes in \n\nmoisture content and temperature. Such amorphous matrix may exist either as a very \n\nviscous glass or a more liquid-like \u201crubbery\u201d amorphous structure. The characteristic \n\ntemperature, Tg, at which the glass-rubber transition occurs, is the physicochemical \n\nparameter that is nowadays a basis for product properties, stability and safety of foods \n\n(Chirife and Buera, 1995; Roos, 1998; Slade and Levine, 1991) (Figure 1.3).  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 Representation of glass transition temperature (Tg) effects on structural \n\ntransformation and diffusion-controlled changes in biological food systems (Roos, 1998). \n\n \n\nThe transition observed at Tg is a second order thermodynamics transition, in \n\nwhich the material undergoes a change in state but not in phase (Rahman, 2006), and  \n\nis dependent on both composition and solid content of a material (Ferry, 1980). Tg \n\ngreatly influences food stability, as the water in the concentrated phase becomes \n\nkinetically immobilised and therefore does not support or participate in reactions \n\n(Rahman, 2006; Slade and Levine, 1991). Below Tg, the food is expected to be stable; \n\nand above this temperature the difference (T- Tg) between Tg and the storage \n\ntemperature T, is assumed to control the rate of physical, chemical and biological \n\nchanges. As discussed already, these physical and chemical reactions, which are \n\ndependent on the diffusion of reactant molecules would be quite slow in the \n\nsupercooled liquid or rubber, in the vicinity of the Tg, and kinetically controlled by \n\nmobility or viscosity (Champion et al., 2000). \n\nTg is therefore a very promising and innovative concept for food science, and \n\nis considered as a future challenge when associated with other food mechanisms \n\n(Rahman, 2006). Despite of this, experimental evidences demonstrate some fragility \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\n(Chirife and Buera, 1994; Hills et al., 1996c; Lin et al., 2006; Vittadini et al., 2003). Tg \n\nconsiders mobility at a macromolecular level and, therefore, is a parameter descriptive \n\nof the physical state and overall mobility of macromolecules, which differs from the \n\nmolecular mobility of smaller molecules such as water (Lin et al., 2006; Vittadini et al., \n\n2005). \n\nMoreover, some experimental evidence does not support a clear correlation \n\nbetween Tg and microbial activity (Chirife and Buera, 1994; Vittadini et al., 2003). \n\nSimilarly, many investigations demonstrate that glass transition alone cannot explain \n\nenzymatic and nonenzymatic activities below Tg. In some cases, reactions occur \n\nslower in the rubbery state than in the glassy state (e.g. ascorbic acid oxidation, \n\nbecause the structural collapse in the rubbery state does not allow O2 diffusion \n\nthrough the system, which results in slower ascorbic acid degradation rates) (Lin et \n\nal., 2006). \n\nMoreover, Tg is not as easy to measure as, for example, water activity, and \n\nmay not be a representative parameter in multicomponent, multidomain complex \n\nfoods (Maltini et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n 1.2.3. Water proton relaxation time and NMR as a powerful technique for \n\n assessing proton relaxation time  \n\n Biological systems, and particularly foods, consist largely of water and \n\nmacromolecules, both rich in protons. Proton relaxation time (T2) is a characteristic of \n\nproton dynamics/mobility (Champion et al., 2000), and is a function of physical and \n\nchemical characteristics of individual chemical compounds, as well as interactions \n\namong them (Marcone et al., 2013; Ruan and Chen, 1998). Water protons are one of \n\nthe most important contributors to the proton relaxation in biological systems, and the \n\ninteractions between water and macromolecules is the most important factor affecting \n\nproton relaxation process (Ruan and Chen, 1998). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most common \n\ninvestigated techniques used to evaluate systems molecular dynamics, by identifying \n\nmolecular structures and evaluating the progress of chemical reactions (Marcone et \n\nal., 2013). This technique provides information on different food components, that are \n\nconsidered as dense complex systems (Domjan et al., 2009; Hills et al., 1991; Ruan \n\nand Chen, 1998), both in solution and solid state (Claridge, 2009; Keeler, 2002; Yan \n\net al., 1996). It also allows to study independently the dynamics of water and food \n\nsolids (Kou et al., 1999). \n\nWater dynamics/mobility can be analysed by NMR, through proton (\n1\nH), \n\ndeuterium (\n2\nH) and oxygen-17 (\n\n17\nO) (Vittadini et al., 2003). \n\n1\nH NMR, as the most used \n\nNMR technique, has been used to investigate water dynamics and physical structures \n\nthought analysis of proton nuclear magnetisation relaxation times (Li et al., 2000). \n\nMany researchers have found that the mobility of water, as measured by NMR, is \n\nrelated to the dynamics and \u201cavailability\u201d of water in complex system (Hills et al., \n\n1991; Ruan and Chen, 1998), i.e. the higher mobility of water, the higher the \n\navailability of water and very mobile water molecules take a long time to reach their \n\nequilibrium state, or relax very slowly, thus having a small relaxation rate or long \n\nrelaxation time (Ruan and Chen, 1998).  \n\nIn these measurements the samples are submitted to a static magnetic field \n\nand the protons are excited by means of a radiofrequency pulse. The analysis of the \n\nsignal emitted while the samples return to equilibrium (FID) allows determining the \n\nspin-lattice (T1) and spin-spin (T2) relaxation. This later variable is related with the \n\nmobility of the protons in the sample matrix.  \n\nFor example, in plant tissues different compartments can be discriminated, \n\nwhere water molecules or protons are in exchange. These exchange rates between \n\ncompartments are controlled by the proton permeability of the membranes separating \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\nthe compartments, and/or by the diffusion process by which water molecules reach \n\nthe membranes (Snaar and Van As, 1992). \n\nNMR can be applied in complex food systems to do quantitative and \n\nconformational analysis (nutritional or functional aspects), quality control of packaging \n\nmaterials, process control (Marcone et al., 2013), and also to evaluate food quality \n\nduring storage period. In the last case, the degradation changes that occur along \n\nstorage promote changes both in water and solutes bounding and structure, which \n\nresults in differences in NMR properties of the food (Ludescher et al., 2001; Ruan and \n\nChen, 1998). \n\nLiterature reports diverse studies applying this technique to different foods and \n\nwith different purposes. Some examples are discussed below (section 1.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3. Food structure/microstructure \n\nFood \u201cmatrices\u201d (systems) physical behaviour and stability depend strongly on \n\ntheir molecular mobility, but also on microstructure. Food microstructure recognises \n\nthat foods are highly structured and heterogeneous materials, composed of \n\narchitectural elements. The types of such structural units and their interactions are \n\ndecisive in the food physical behaviour and functional properties, such as texture or \n\nsensorial attributes, and also physical and chemical stability during storage. They \n\ninfluence the water/solute interactions and hence the water availability to participate in \n\nmicrobial growth and degradation reactions (Aguilera, 2000). In fact, these \n\nintermolecular interactions in which the water molecules play a very important role, \n\ncan determine the structure of the food material at the beginning of a given process \n\nand during processing (Wang and Liapis, 2012). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\nAlso, the effective water diffusivity in foods, as well as free water content, \n\nhighly depends on pore structure or particle size distribution (Peppas and Brannon-\n\nPeppas, 1994; Pittia and Sacchetti, 2008; Xiong et al., 1992).  \n\nIn addition to water, other structural elements can be identified in foods, such \n\nas oil droplets, gas cells, fat crystals, strands, granules, micelles, and interfaces \n\n(Aguilera, 2000). These structural elements, composed of proteins, carbohydrates, \n\nand lipids (in various combinations and proportions), can exist in different states \n\n(glassy/rubbery/crystalline) even at uniform temperatures and water activity. This \n\nstructural heterogeneity will necessarily affect the molecular dynamics in the system \n\nand consequently the macroscopic food quality attributes (Ludescher et al., 2001) and \n\ntheir behaviour along storage.  \n\nDesigning the food structure during processing can also affect its behaviour \n\nduring shelf life. For example, physically separating the reactants in microstructural \n\nlocations can control the biochemical activity by avoiding the reactants to be in \n\ncontact, thus minimizing the development of off-flavours and browning reactions \n\n(Aguilera, 2000). Food microstructure can also be altered by controlling various \n\nintermolecular and inter particle interactions among the different ingredients during \n\nprocessing and storage (Lesmes and McClements, 2009). Engineering structures \n\nrequires knowledge on the molecular organisation of the ingredients (short and long \n\nrange molecule assemblies) and physical properties, such as charge density, \n\nhydrophobicity, molecular size and conformation under different environmental \n\nconditions (Scholten et al., 2014). The expression \u201cstructure-function\u201d, nowadays \n\nwidely used, describes basically the way in which physicochemical and functional \n\nproperties of foods are related with their structure (Aguilera et al., 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n1.4. Practical applications of NMR to assess molecular dynamics and structure \n\nAs previously referred, molecular mobility/dynamics has been identified as one \n\nof the actual most promising parameters for assessing physicochemical properties in \n\nmulti-component systems. This fact justifies the significant number and type of \n\nexperimental works performed in food systems. This section briefly discusses \n\nexamples of \n1\nH NMR practical applications on food systems, considering matrices of \n\ndifferent complexities. \n\n \n\n 1.4.1. Edible films as food systems models \n\nEdible films have been studied for a long time for their potential to improve \n\nshelf-life and safety of food products (Aider, 2010; Epure et al., 2011). The literature is \n\nextensive in characterisation of such materials, and particularly in reporting the thermo \n\nmechanical behaviour and barrier properties of glassy biopolymers and polymers \n\n(Butler et al., 1996; Lazaridou and Biliaderis, 2002). These systems are partially \n\ncrystalline/partially amorphous and easily reproducible materials. From a fundamental \n\nperspective, foods are mainly edible and digestible biopolymers that are partially \n\ncrystalline/partially amorphous (Wang and Liapis, 2012), and thus edible films can be \n\nvery interesting food model systems for mobility and microstructure studies. Also, in \n\nthese films, water is one of the most important components, i.e. is used significantly \n\nas a plasticiser, creating hydrogen bonds with the polymeric chains present in the \n\nsystem and influencing its physical properties, e.g. relaxation (Hasegawa et al., 1992).  \n\nHowever, it is evident the lack of systematic information about the relationship \n\nbetween the effect of films composition on the microstructure and molecular dynamics \n\nof polymeric systems behaviour. A few published papers take advantage of these \n\ntechniques. \n1\nH NMR has been used to characterise starch-chitosan films with different \n\nlevels of glycerol (Liu et al., 2013). This technique proved to be useful in clarifying the \n\ninteractions between films components. It was showed that the addition of glycerol \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\npromoted the interactions among chitosan, starch and glycerol through hydrogen \n\nbonding. The stronger glycerol/starch/chitosan interactions in samples containing \n\nhigher glycerol concentration were confirmed by an observed decrease of glycerol \n\nmobility. \n1\nH NMR experiments have also allowed understanding the differences on \n\nascorbic acid stability observed in different films (Le\u00f3n et al., 2008). This study proved \n\nthat the water dynamics influences the ascorbic acid stability and recognises which of \n\nthe compounds added to film forming solutions (e.g. calcium) interacted with this \n\ndynamics. \n\n \n\n1.4.2. Real food matrices \n\nFruits are high water content products with a complex cellular structure, where \n\nwater can be present in both intra and extra cellular spaces. The general fruit \n\nconstitution may be described as a watery solution of low molecular weight species, \n\nmainly sugars, salts and organic acids, and high molecular weight hydrocolloids, \n\ncontained in a water insoluble cellular matrix of macromolecules, mostly \n\ncarbohydrates including insoluble pectic substances, hemicelluloses, proteins and, \n\nsometimes, lignins. Intracellular air spaces are present in parenchymous tissue and \n\nthese may be considered as true structural elements, having a very characteristic \n\ninfluence on the perceived texture. This complexity makes these systems of special \n\ninterest for mobility studies.  \n\nMany studies have been performed on the application of \n1\nH NMR techniques \n\nfor evolution of quality in fruits. This technique allows using the changes in the \n\ndistribution of water proton transverse relaxation times to monitor the subcellular \n\ncompartmentation of water.  \n\n1\nH NMR has been a tool used for purposes as diverse as study the effect of \n\npreservation processes (Hills and Remigereau, 1997; Panarese et al., 2012; Tylewicz \n\net al., 2011), monitoring food quality changes during storage (Zhang and McCarthy, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\n2013), analysing food quality characteristics (Hern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2007; \n\nMarigheto et al., 2008; Tu et al., 2007), or just monitoring ripening (Raffo et al., 2005). \n\nThe work of Hills and co-workers (1991) was an important milestone in the use \n\nof this technique. The group first identified the signals of water in the cellular wall, \n\ncytoplasm and vacuole (Hills et al., 1991; Hills et al., 1996a; Hills et al., 1996c) and \n\napplied the methodology for studying the effect of preservation processes on foods. \n\nAn example is the study on changes in subcellular water compartmentation in \n\nparenchyma apple tissues during freezing/thawing (Hills and Remigereau, 1997). \n\nFigure 1.4 shows the differences in water proton transverse relaxation time profile for \n\nfresh and freezing/thawing apple tissues. For the fresh apple tissue, behaviour \n\npresents a proton distribution following three peaks that can be assigned to water \n\nlocated in the vacuolar, cytoplasm and cell wall compartments. After thawing the \n\nabsence of the three peaks indicate membrane rupture and loss of turgor in the \n\ntissue, the cellular structure was broken and the vacuole, cytoplasm and cellular wall \n\nlost their integrity and become just one compartment. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 Distribution of transverse water proton relaxation times in fresh and freeze-thawed \n\napple tissues (Hills and Remigereau, 1997). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nAs discussed, another example on the use of NMR is to understand the \n\nresponse of fruit\u2019s quality parameters to different storage conditions, such as on \n\npomegranate fruit (Zhang and McCarthy, 2013). In this case, NMR measurements \n\nallow analysing the microscopic structure changes during storage and confirm the \n\nwater environment in each component. The authors found that water was redistributed \n\nbetween subcellular compartments of the pomegranate aril tissues during controlled \n\natmosphere storage.  \n\nAnother study has addressed the water proton relaxation times in different \n\npear varieties with two different levels of internal damage (sound tissue and \n\ndisordered tissue) and tried to find a relationship with the internal browning process \n\nand complement the observations with image techniques (Hern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez et al., \n\n2007). If was possible to conclude that, at least for one pear variety, internal browning \n\n(postharvest disorder) may be identified and correlated with the NMR parameters. \n\nMoreover, it was also possible to infer that the cell decompartmentation facilitates the \n\naccessibility of enzymes and subtracts (responsible for browning reactions). The \n\nanalysis of firmness and soluble solids content were performed and no correlation \n\nbetween internal browning was found, evidencing once again the relevance of NMR to \n\nsupport the internal inspection of the fruit. \n\nOne last example is a study aiming at understanding the banana ripening \n\nphenomenon (Raffo et al., 2005), showing the relationship between changes in water \n\ndynamics and variations in chemical composition. Results from NMR allow explaining \n\nthe ripening process that happen for a period of seven days, and where membrane-\n\nbound starch granules are almost converted to soluble sugars. Shortly, three \n\ncomponents were determined, attributed to vacuole, cytoplasm and cell wall. T2 \n\nvalues attributed to cytoplasmatic and vacuolar water show a gradual increase, \n\ncorrelated with the disappearance of starch that acts as a relaxation sink (Figure 1.5). \n\nThe disappearance of these granules during ripening increases the cytoplasm and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nvacuolar water fractions, that can be influenced by the chemical diffusive exchange \n\neffect, increasing cytoplasm and vacuole T2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 Banana proton transverse relaxation time, during seven days of storage (Raffo et \n\nal., 2005). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n1.5. Conclusions \n\nThis section reviewed some critical issues and highlighted works in food \n\nsystems molecular dynamics assessment. Molecular dynamics together with \n\nstructure/ microstructure are important approaches to study food systems properties \n\nand stability. Water is one of the most important food components and is a key factor \n\nin biological systems performance. Water activity, glass transition temperature and \n\nwater proton relaxation time are three concepts that have been used to determine the \n\nwater performance. Water proton relaxation time, assessed by NMR techniques, is \n\none of the broadest methods to understand dynamics, even in complex biological \n\nsystems like foods. Dynamic properties play an important role in complementing the \n\ninformation provided by methods based on systems equilibrium and global kinetics. \n\nHowever, it is evident the lack of systematic information, even in straightforward \n\nmodel food matrices.  \n\nFurther work on relationships between water and solids mobility and glass \n\ntransition or water activity in food systems is a fundamental and necessary approach \n\nto fully attain food physical properties and stability. The absence of studies on the \n\nrelationship between degradation of quality factors and molecular mobility along shelf-\n\nlife is also evident.  \n\nThese studies may be extremely useful for food product and process design, \n\nsafety and sensorial attributes and also for better understanding and predicting, for \n\nexample, food storage stability conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPART II \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\nFilm forming solutions polymer/plasticiser ratio effect on the films \n\nproperties \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nAbstract \n\nIn this chapter the physico-chemical properties of chitosan/glycerol film forming \n\nsolutions (FFS) and resulting films were analysed. Solutions were prepared using \n\ndifferent concentrations of plasticising agent (glycerol) and chitosan. Films were \n\nproduced by solvent casting and equilibrated in a controlled atmosphere. FFS water \n\nactivity and rheological behaviour were determined. Films water content, solubility, \n\nwater vapour and oxygen permeabilities, thickness, and mechanical and thermal \n\nproperties were determined. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was also \n\nused to study the chitosan/glycerol interactions. \n\nResults demonstrate that FFS chitosan concentration influenced solutions \n\nconsistency coefficient and that this was related with differences in films water \n\nretention and structure. Plasticiser addition led to an increase in films moisture \n\ncontent, solubility and water vapour permeability, water affinity and structural \n\nchanges. Films thermo-mechanical properties were significantly affected by both \n\nchitosan and glycerol addition. FTIR experiments confirmed these results. \n\nThis chapter highlights the importance of glycerol and water plasticisation in \n\nfilms properties. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\nEdible films technology presents several challenges, especially on the \n\nrelationship between the composition and properties of FFS and the properties of the \n\nobtained films. The viscosity and molecular entanglement of the FFS are of great \n\nimportance since it may affect the obtained film properties, such as thickness, \n\nmechanical and thermal properties, water retention capacity, water affinity and oxygen \n\npermeability.  \n\nNatural polymers are inherently brittle due to their complex branched primary \n\nstructure and weak intermolecular forces (Srinivasa et al., 2007). The primary role of \n\nplasticisers is to improve the flexibility and processability of polymers, by reducing the \n\nintermolecular forces, softening the rigidity of the film structure and rising the mobility \n\nof the biopolymeric chains (Melissa Gurgel Adeodato Vieira, 2011; Srinivasa et al., \n\n2007). These additives reduce the tension of deformation, hardness, density, viscosity \n\nand electrostatic charge of a polymer, simultaneously increasing chain flexibility, \n\nresistance and the dielectric constant (Ferry, 1980). \n\nGlycerol is the most widely used plasticiser due to its good efficiency, large \n\navailability and low exudation (Epure et al., 2011). Moreover, this plasticiser has a \n\nboiling point and hydrogen bond ability causing high retention in the polymer. Glycerol \n\nhas also been used to modify natural macromolecules like proteins (Quijada-Garrido \n\net al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2005) and carbohydrates.  \n\nWater is also one of the most important plasticisers of biological systems, such \n\nas foods (Neto et al., 2005; Roos, 1995), since water molecules create hydrogen \n\nbonds with the polymeric chains present in the system.  \n\nChitosan is a semicrystalline biopolymer, having a great potential for chemical \n\nand mechanical modifications, to create novel properties, functions and applications in \n\ndifferent areas (Pillai et al., 2009). Due to its properties, the use of chitosan in edible \n\nfilms development has been long studied (Neto et al., 2005; Pillai et al., 2009). These \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nstudies have shown that chitosan films properties depend on several parameters, \n\nsuch as chitosan molecular weight and degree of deacetylation, organic acid used \n\nand the possible presence of plasticiser (Epure et al., 2011; Suyatma et al., 2005). \n\nThe film structure is one of the main responsible for its properties. This is \n\nreported to be related with the polymer free volume, which affects molecular mobility \n\nof the polymeric matrix (Dlubek et al., 2005; Slade and Levine, 1991). The structure of \n\nthe film is strongly affected by the composition, specially the amounts of polymer and \n\nplasticiser in the FFS and the ratio between these compounds.  \n\nThis chapter aims at systematically investigating how the properties and \n\nstructure of chitosan films are influenced by the properties and composition of the \n\nFFS. To achieve that, film forming solutions were prepared with 3 different chitosan \n\nconcentrations and with three chitosan/glycerol ratios, and the rheological behaviour \n\nwas characterised. The water, barrier, mechanical and thermal properties and FTIR \n\nspectra of the obtained films were characterised. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Material and methods \n\n \n\n 2.2.1. Chitosan FFS preparation \n\n FFS were prepared by dissolving different chitosan (90% deacetylation, Aqua \n\nPremier Co., Thailand) concentrations (1%, 2% and 3% w/v) in a 1% lactic acid \n\nsolution (Acros Organics, Belgium), and adding to different levels (10%, 50% and 90% \n\nw/w) of plasticising agent, (glycerol - Panreac, Spain). These conditions allow the \n\nachievement of the same ratio chitosan/glycerol (see Table 2.1). It was decided not to \n\nconsider films without glycerol, since these films are too brittle, making impossible to \n\nperform most of the analysis. To promote a good homogenisation an Ultra-Turrax was \n\nused (IKA T18 basic, Wilmington, NC, USA). To allow significant comparisons, two \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nreplicates (samples) were made for each experimental condition (chitosan/plasticiser \n\nratio). \n\n \n\n 2.2.2 Characterisation of FFS \n\n \n\n2.2.2.1. Rheological behaviour \n\nRheology of FFS was studied by viscometry tests, using a controlled stress \n\nrheometer Bohlin VOR (Bohlin Instruments Ltd, Cirencester UK) at 23 \u00baC and a cone-\n\nplate configuration. For each sample three measurements were carried out.  \n\n \n\n2.2.2.2. Water activity \n\nMeasurements were performed with a dew point hygrometer (Aqualab - Series \n\n3, Decagon Devices Inc., USA.), at 23 \u00b1 1 \u00baC. The sensitivity of the equipment was \n\n0.001. Calibration was carried out before experiments with distilled water and \n\nsaturated saline solutions. Water activity value of each sample resulted from the \n\naverage of nine readings. \n\n \n\n 2.2.3. Chitosan films preparation \n\nA constant amount (300 mL) of the chitosan solutions was casted in 32 X 40 \n\ncm plates and dried in an incubator at 40 \u00baC, for three days. Prior to any \n\ncharacterisation, films were stored at 22 \u00baC and 53% RH, until equilibrium was \n\nreached. Once again, to allow significant comparisons, two replicates of films \n\n(samples) were produced for each experimental condition (chitosan/plasticiser ratio). \n\nAll measurements were performed at controlled temperature (22 \u00baC) and humidity \n\n(53%) room. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n 2.2.4. Characterisation of films \n\n \n\n2.2.4.1. Water activity, moisture content and solubility \n\nFilms aw were determined using the same methodology described under point \n\n2.2.2.2.  \n\nTo determine the films moisture content (MC), approximately 50 mg of film \n\nwere dried at 105 \u00baC, until weight equilibrium was attained. The weight loss of the \n\nsample was determined, and MC was calculated as the percentage of water removed \n\nfrom the system. Three measurements were obtained for each sample. \n\nSolubility (SOL) was determined as the content of dry matter solubilised after \n\n24 hours of immersion in distilled water. Two pieces of each sample, previously dried \n\nuntil constant weight, were immersed in 50 mL of water (at 23 \u00baC). After 24 hours of \n\nimmersion with agitation, the pieces of film were withdrawn and dried until constant \n\nweight in an oven at 105 \u00baC, to determine the weight of dry matter not solubilised in \n\nwater. SOL of films in water was determined as the percentage of soluble material. \n\nThree measurements were obtained for each sample. \n\n \n\n2.2.4.2. Films barrier properties \n\nWater vapour permeability (WVP) was evaluated gravimetrically based on \n\nASTM E96-92 method (Bourbon et al., 2011; V. Guillard, 2003). The film was sealed \n\non the top of a permeation cell containing distilled water (100% RH; 2337 Pa vapour \n\npressure at room temperature), placed in a desiccator at 22 \u00baC and 0% RH (0 Pa \n\nwater vapour pressure) containing silica. The cells were weighed at 2 h intervals for \n\n10 h using an analytical balance (McHugh et al., 1993). Two measurements were \n\nmade for each sample. \n\nOxygen permeability (O2P) was determined based on the ASTM D 3985-02 \n\n(2002) method (Martins et al., 2010). Briefly, the films were sealed between two \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nchambers, having each one two channels. In the lower chamber, O2 was supplied at a \n\ncontrolled flow rate (J &amp; W Scientific, ADM 2000, USA) to maintain its pressure \n\nconstant in that compartment. The other chamber was purged with a nitrogen stream, \n\nalso at controlled flow rate. Nitrogen acted as a carrier for the O2. To determine O2 \n\nconcentration, 1 mL of sample was injected in a gas chromatograph (Chrompack \n\n9001, Middelburg, The Netherlands) at 110 \u00baC, equipped with a column Porapak Q \n\n80/100 mesh 2 m x 1/8\u2019\u2019 x 2 mm SS, and a thermal conductivity detector at 110 \u00baC. \n\nHelium at 23 mL min\n-1\n was used as carrier gas. A standard mixture containing 10% \n\nCO2, 20% O2 and 70% N2 was used for calibration. The flows of the two chambers \n\nwere connected to a manometer to ensure the equality of pressures (both at 1 atm) \n\nbetween both compartments. As the O2 was carried continuously by the nitrogen flow, \n\nit was considered that partial pressure of O2 in the upper compartment is null, \n\ntherefore ?P is equal to 1 atm. Three measurements were taken for each sample. \n\n \n\n2.2.4.3. Films thickness \n\nThe thickness of the produced films was measured using a digital micrometer \n\n(Mitutoyo, Japan). From each sample a minimum of 8 stripes (15 \u00d7 170 mm) were cut, \n\nand at least 2 readings were randomly performed at different positions. \n\n \n\n2.2.4.4. Films mechanical properties \n\nFilms mechanical properties, namely elongation at break (EB) and tensile \n\nstrength (TS), were determined in extension with an Instron Universal Testing \n\nMachine (Model 4500, Instron Corporation, U.S.A.), following the ASTM D 882-91 \n\n(1991). The initial grip separation and the crosshead speed were set at 100 mm and \n\n50 mm min\n-1\n, respectively. EB was calculated as the ratio of the final length at the \n\npoint of sample rupture to the initial length of a specimen (100 mm), and expressed as \n\na percentage. TS was expressed in MPa and calculated dividing the maximum load \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\n(N) by the initial cross-sectional area of the specimen. EB and TS tests were \n\nreplicated nine times for each sample. \n\n \n\n2.2.4.5. Films thermal properties \n\nThe films thermal profiles, glass transition temperature (Tg), melting enthalpy \n\n(?h) and melting temperature (Tm), were determined using differential scanning \n\ncalorimetry (DSC). DSC was performed using a TA-60WS, Shimadzu Corporation, \n\nJapan, with a cooling accessory, under N2 atmosphere (20 mL min\n-1\n). \n\nFilm samples of approximately 5 mg were weighed into aluminium cups and \n\nsealed hermetically. An empty cup was used as reference and the temperature was \n\nincreased at 20 \u00baC min\n-1\n, from -150 to 200 \u00baC. The maximum temperature of 200 \u00baC \n\nwas selected in order to avoid possible chitosan degradation (Bourbon et al., 2011). \n\nThermograms were analysed using the Universal Analyses Software TA-60WS \n\n(Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). Two measurements were made for each sample. \n\n \n\n2.2.4.6. FTIR-ATR spectroscopy \n\nAll spectra were acquired using a spectrometer Perkin-Elmer (Spectrum BX, \n\nGermany) set up for mid-infrared measurements equipped with a horizontal one single \n\nreflection ATR Golden Gate (Specac, Germany). The software OPUS v. 5.0 (Br\u00fcker, \n\nGermany) was programmed to record each spectrum between 4000 and 600 cm\n-1\n, at \n\na resolution of 4 cm\n-1\n. Samples and background measurements were made by \n\ncoadding 128 scans for each spectrum before Fourier transformation. The \n\ninterferometer was operated at a laser frequency of 10 kHz and in the single-sided \n\ndirectional mode. Fourier transformation was done with a Mertz phase correction, a \n\ntriangular apodisation function, with a zero-filling factor of 2. At least three spectrum \n\nreplicates were recorded for each film composition. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\n2.2.4.7. Data analysis \n\nTo conclude on the isolated effect of chitosan addition in film forming solutions \n\nand obtained films (p<0.05), experimental results were analysed by one-way ANOVA \n\nand post hoc multiple comparison tests (Tukey\u2019s test), for a fixed glycerol \n\nconcentration. To evaluate glycerol addition, statistical analysis of the data was \n\nperformed fixing the chitosan concentration. \n\nTo assess samples rheological behaviour a power law model (Eq. 2.1) was \n\nfitted to the experimental data of shear stress (?) as a function of shear rate (??): \n ? = ? ?? ?         (2.1) \nwhere n is the flow behaviour index, and K the consistency coefficient. \n\n \n\nWVP was estimated using regression analysis from equation 2.2; adapted \n\nfrom literature (Sobral et al., 2001) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were \n\ncalculated: \n\n  \u00d7 ? \u00d7?? = WVP \u00d7 ?        (2.2) \nwhere x is the average thickness of edible films, A the permeation area \n\n(0.005524 m\n2), ?P the difference of partial vapour pressure of the atmosphere (2337 \n\nPa at 20 \u00baC), w the weight loss, and t the experimental time. \n\nSpectra analysis was performed using the CATS 97 program (Barros, 1999). \n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the \n\ndata and to extract the main sources of variability. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\n2.3. Results and discussion \n\n \n 2.3.1. Characterisation of the FFS \n \n\nThe rheological behaviour and aw of the FFS used in this study are presented \n\nin Table 2.1 (results are included in Appendix A, Tables A.1.1 and A.1.2).  \n\nFor all the tested FFS, results show a shear thinning behaviour, which is \n\ncommonly used for describing the polymer melt behaviour (Steffe, 1996). The Power \n\nLaw Model (Eq. 2.1) successfully described the obtained rheograms. Flow index (n) \n\nand consistency coefficient (K) were estimated and the corresponding 95% \n\nconfidence limits calculated (Table 2.1) (Chillo et al., 2008; Garcia et al., 2004) (data \n\nin Appendix A, Table A.1.1). \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n   \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nTable 2.1 \n\nExperimental results for the characterisation of film forming solutions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n*Mean values followed by the same letter are not significantly different at 0.05 by the Tukey HSD test; Letters from Gly column concern to differences between glycerol concentrations (for the \nsame chitosan concentration); Letters from Chit column refer to analysis of the effect of chitosan concentration (for the same glycerol content). \n\n \n\nK: consistency coefficient; n: flow index; aw: water activity \n\n \n\n   \n \n\nViscosity Parameters \n   \n\n \nChit \n\n \nGly \n\n \nChit/ Gly \n\n \nK (Pa s\n\nn\n) \n\n \nn \n\n \naw \n\n \nGly \n\n \nChit \n\n(w/v %) (w/v %) Ratio (w/w) (\u00b1 95% Confidence Error) (\u00b1 95% Confidence Error) (\u00b1 Standard Deviation) * * \n\n \n1 \n\n \n10 \n\n \n7.92 \n\n \n0.198\u00b10.010 \n\n \n0.810\u00b10.018 \n\n \n1.002\u00b10.001 \n\n \na \n\n \na \n\n1 50 1.59 0.254\u00b10.021 0.803\u00b10.006 1.000\u00b10.001 a a \n\n1 90 0.88 0.219\u00b10.013 0.814\u00b10.004 0.999\u00b10.002 a a \n\n        \n\n2 10 7.94 2.132\u00b10.430 0.656\u00b10.018 1.001\u00b10.001 a a \n\n2 50 1.58 1.450\u00b10.104 0.682\u00b10.001 1.001\u00b10.001 a a \n\n2 90 0.88 1.591\u00b10.135 0.683\u00b10.008 0.997\u00b10.001 a a \n\n        \n\n3 10 7.94 3.371\u00b10.260 0.620\u00b10.005 1.002\u00b10.001 a a \n\n3 50 1.59 3.221\u00b10.095 0.623\u00b10.003 0.999\u00b10.001 ab a \n\n3 90 0.88 3.034\u00b10.130 0.635\u00b10.002 0.995\u00b10.002 b a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n \n\nGlycerol addition showed no significant effect on FFS rheological behaviour, \n\nassessed by n and K estimates. On the other hand, chitosan concentration affected \n\nsignificantly FFS rheological behaviour, ranging from close to Newtonian (low chitosan \n\nconcentrations, n?1) to a pseudoplastic behaviour (with increasing chitosan \n\nconcentration, n decreasing). Also, K significantly increased with chitosan addition. \n\nThese results can be related with the lower amounts of water present in the solutions \n\nwith higher polymer/plasticiser concentration.  \n\nAs discussed before, although different chitosan and glycerol concentrations \n\nwere used to prepare the FFS, for each chitosan level studied (1, 2 and 3%), the \n\nsame ratios chitosan/glycerol were tested (see Table 2.1). However, the observed \n\nrheological behaviour showed that the amount of polymer in the solution has a higher \n\nimpact on FFS viscoelastic properties than the ratio between polymer and plasticiser. \n\nRegarding aw, a significant effect of chitosan and glycerol addition was \n\nobserved, while no differences were found between replicates (p>0.05, Main Effects \n\nANOVA, data in Appendix A, Table A.1.2). To conclude on the significance (p<0.05) \n\nof the isolated effect of glycerol concentration on the aw of the FFS (for the same \n\nchitosan concentration), results were analysed using the glycerol concentration as the \n\ncategorical predictor factor (Gly column on Table 2.1.). For testing significance of the \n\neffect of chitosan concentration (for the same glycerol concentration), results were \n\nanalysed using chitosan concentration as the factor (Chit column on Table 2.1).  \n\nResults show that there is no significant effect of the amount of the polymer \n\npresent on the aw of the solutions. However, the addition of glycerol as a plasticiser \n\nshowed a different effect depending on chitosan concentration: for lower chitosan \n\nconcentration (1%), the addition of glycerol did not affect aw. While, with increasing \n\nchitosan concentration, glycerol addition decreased solutions aw. This effect would be \n\neven more evident for higher chitosan concentrations. Statistical analyses show that \n\nsolutions with 3% chitosan concentration and different levels of glycerol are \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\nsignificantly different, while at lower chitosan concentration (1%) glycerol additions \n\nlead to no significant differences between samples (Gly column on Table 2.1).  \n\nThese results may indicate that interaction of the plasticiser and water \n\nmolecules with the polymeric chain plays a critical role not only in films, but also in the \n\nFFS and may influence the water evaporation during films drying.  \n\n \n\n 2.3.2. Characterisation of chitosan films \n\n \n\n2.3.2.1. Water and barrier properties \n\nExperimental results for aw, MC, SOL and WVP of chitosan films are presented \n\nin Table 2.2 (data in Appendix A, Tables A.2.1, A.2.2 and A.2.3). No differences \n\nbetween replicates were observed (p>0.05, Main Effects ANOVA, data in Appendix A \n\nSection A.3). Again, to conclude on the significance of glycerol and chitosan \n\nconcentrations effects on the different film\u00b4s properties, experimental results were \n\nanalysed first using the glycerol concentration as categorical predictor factor (Gly \n\ncolumn on Table 2.2). For testing significance of the effect of chitosan concentration \n\n(for the same glycerol concentration), results were analysed using chitosan \n\nconcentration as the factor (Chit column on Table 2.2).  \n\nThe aw results show that chitosan concentration has a significant effect on this \n\nparameter (Table 2.2). However, glycerol only has a significant effect for films \n\nproduced with higher chitosan content (3%). In this case, higher glycerol content led \n\nto higher aw values. These results may be related with the polymer, plasticiser and/or \n\nwater ratios and bindings. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n \n\n \n\nTable 2.2 \n\nExperimental results for chitosan films water related properties. \n\n \n\n*Mean values followed by the same letter are not significantly different at 0.05 by the Tukey HSD test; Letters from Gly column concern to differences between glycerol concentrations (for the \n\nsame chitosan concentration); Letters from Chit column refer to analysis of the effect of chitosan concentration (for the same glycerol content). \n\n \n\naw: water activity; MC: moisture content; SOL: water solubility; WVP: water vapour ppermeability \n\n \n\nChit Gly aw Gly Chit MC (%) Gly Chit SOL (%) Gly Chit WVP (g Pa\n-1 \n\ns\n-1 \n\nm\n-1\n\n) \n\n(w/v %) (w/v %) (\u00b1 Standard Deviation) * * (\u00b1 Standard Deviation) * * (\u00b1 Standard Deviation) * * (\u00b1 95% Confidence Error) \n\n \n1 \n\n \n10 \n\n \n0.5543\u00b10.0179 \n\n \na \n\n \na \n\n \n28.87\u00b15.91 \n\n \na \n\n \na \n\n \n48.91\u00b12.11 \n\n \na \n\n \na \n\n \n6.768E-08\u00b12.332E-08 \n\n1 50 0.5561\u00b10.0305 a a 36.64\u00b18.57 ab a 54.09\u00b14.56 a a 9.111E-08\u00b14.118E-09 \n\n1 90 0.5658\u00b10.0170 a a 51.1\u00b13.03 b a 67.52\u00b17.31 b a 8.657E-08\u00b14.210E-09 \n\n             \n\n2 10 0.5195\u00b10.0123 a b 17.83\u00b11.28 a b 36.06\u00b10.95 a b 1.029E-07\u00b15.244E-08 \n\n2 50 0.5031\u00b10.0140 a b 38.32\u00b14.67 b a 51.02\u00b13.78 b a 6.011E-08\u00b18.235E-08 \n\n2 90 0.5011\u00b10.0067 a b 51.92\u00b14.52 c a 61.40\u00b14.22 c a 1.872E-07\u00b11.182E-08 \n\n             \n\n3 10 0.5072\u00b10.0029 a b 16.36\u00b10.88 a b 29.73\u00b11.06 a c 1.601E-07\u00b19.046E-08 \n\n3 50 0.5116\u00b10.0062 ab b 38.87\u00b11.36 b a 49.77\u00b10.89 b a 1.668E-07\u00b17.924E-08 \n\n3 90 0.5296\u00b10.0091 b c 55.06\u00b10.83 c a 63.45\u00b10.65 c a 2.885E-07\u00b19.259E-08 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nRegarding MC, it was observed that higher glycerol concentration solutions \n\nproduced films with significantly higher MC. For every chitosan concentration, \n\nincreasing FFS plasticiser content produced a significant increase on film\u2019s MC (Table \n\n2.2).  \n\nSOL was significantly higher in films produced with higher glycerol \n\nconcentrations (Table 2.2). However, chitosan content only had a significant effect on \n\nsolubility of films produced with low glycerol content (10%). These results may be \n\nrelated with high solubility of glycerol in water (and its hygroscopic nature), due to the \n\nthree hydrophilic hydroxyl groups present (Chillo et al., 2008). \n\nFor the results of chitosan films WVP, it is observed that there are significant \n\ndifferences for different chitosan concentrations (Table 2.2): higher chitosan \n\nconcentrations led to higher values of WVP. This tendency could be explained by an \n\nincrease of amino groups present and consequent higher hydrophilicity of the \n\nbiodegradable blend films when increasing the chitosan content (Bourtoom, 2008). \n\nAlso, samples with higher plasticiser concentration show higher WVP values. These \n\nresults are probably due to an increase in the free volume between the polymer \n\nchains - when hydrophilic plasticisers are incorporated into polysaccharide films, there \n\nis a decrease of the intermolecular forces, making the polymer network less dense \n\nand hence more permeable (Cuq et al., 1997; Lavorgna et al., 2010). \n\nWith respect to samples O2P, no significant differences were observed nor \n\nbetween chitosan neither between glycerol concentrations. Nevertheless, Figure 2.1 \n\ndemonstrates a general tendency with respect to polymer and plasticiser proportions: \n\nhigher chitosan concentrations in the FFS led to higher values of O2P; and higher \n\nplasticiser concentrations led to lower values of O2 permeability. The exception is \n\nsamples produced with 1% chitosan, where O2P values were almost constant for \n\ndifferent glycerol concentrations (results are included in Appendix A, Table A.2.3).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 Oxygen permeability of films prepared with different chitosan and glycerol \n\nconcentrations (? 1%, ? 2%; ? 3% chitosan). \n\n \n\nThese results are supported by a direct relationship between decreasing \n\ncrystallinity of the films (see Table 2.3 of the section below) and the decrease in O2P, \n\nand may indicate that structural changes should be investigated in the future. \n\nOverall, the addition of plasticiser led to an increase in MC, SOL and WVP of \n\nthe films, showing increased water affinity and structural changes. This was also \n\nreflected on O2P decrease with glycerol addition. Chitosan concentration did not \n\nsignificantly affect such properties. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.2.

This may indicate that chitosan is the main contributor to film thickness. \n\n \n\nRegarding the films mechanical properties, both chitosan and glycerol addition \n\nled to significant differences in EB and TS. At 1% chitosan, the amount of glycerol \n\nadded shows a conventional action of plasticisers, increasing EB and decreasing the \n\nTS. This effect is due to chitosan chains interactions, decreasing intermolecular \n\nattraction and increasing polymer mobility, which facilitates film elongation (Suyatma \n\net al., 2005; Ziani et al., 2008). However, films produced with solutions with higher \n\nchitosan content (2 and 3 w/v %) and 50% glycerol had a deviant behaviour: showing \n\nhigher EB than films with 90% of glycerol. This behaviour has been previously \n\nobserved and may occur due to the relationship between polymer/plasticiser \n\nconcentrations, corresponding to an antiplasticisation phenomenon: a stronger \n\ninteraction might be occurring between the polymer and the plasticiser, producing a \n\n\u201ccross-linker\u201d effect, which decreases the free volume and the molecular mobility of \n\nthe polymer (Lourdin et al., 1997; Suyatma et al., 2005; Ziani et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nTg is associated with a change in the physical properties and state of \n\nmaterials, and can be related with the plasticisation of amorphous regions within semi-\n\ncrystalline materials (Roudaut et al., 2004). Tg is considered a second order phase \n\ntransition and occurs over the temperature range at which a glassy material enters the \n\nrubbery domain (Lazaridou and Biliaderis, 2002). At temperatures above Tg various \n\nphysical properties are significantly affected (Lazaridou and Biliaderis, 2002; Slade \n\nand Levine, 1991). Table 2.3 shows the Tg for the different films analysed. Results \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\ndemonstrate that glycerol significantly affected films Tg. As expected, plasticiser \n\n(glycerol) lowered Tg (Rivero et al., 2010; Suyatma et al., 2005), which also correlated \n\nwell with MC (Table 2.2), since water acts as plasticiser itself (Arvanitoyannisa et al., \n\n1998; Dai et al., 2006; Rivero et al., 2010). The chitosan/glycerol ratio also affected Tg \n\n(Figure 2.2a): increasing ratio lead to a Tg decrease. This may be related with the free \n\nvolume in the films (as was discussed above). Higher plasticiser content increases \n\nfree volume, and higher polymer content decreases this variable (Lourdin et al., 1997; \n\nRivero et al., 2010; Roudaut et al., 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 Glass transition temperature (Tg) (a) and melting temperature (Tm) (b) of the \n\nchitosan films prepared with different chitosan/glycerol concentrations (? 1%, ? 2%; ? 3% \n\nchitosan). \n\n \n\nThe crystalline component of the films was evaluated by the melting enthalpy \n\n(?h) and melting temperature (Tm). Table 2.3 shows that ?h increased with increasing \n\nchitosan concentrations, particularly for samples produced with lower glycerol \n\nconcentrations. This result was expected once that chitosan, as a polymer, is \n\nresponsible for the formation of crystals in the system. Also, plasticiser addition \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nincreased the ?h, i.e. increases the samples crystallinity, and this may be due to \n\nglycerol interaction with chitosan chains: the H-bonds stabilised the chitosan crystals \n\n(Okuyama et al., 1997).  \n\nIn Figure 2.2b the values of the Tm ranged from 110 to 140 \u00baC. Despite the fact \n\nthat these values were not significantly different between formulations, a tendency in \n\nvalues depending on the FFS composition is observed. Higher concentrations of \n\nchitosan presented lower Tm values. On the other hand, temperature of the main peak \n\nshifted to higher melting temperatures when increasing plasticiser concentration \n\n(decreasing ratio), as referred in previously published results (Rivero et al., 2010), and \n\nmay be also related with an increase of the strength of the H-bonds stabilising the \n\nchitosan crystals in the presence of plasticiser (Okuyama et al., 1997). \n\nOverall, thermal and mechanical characterisation showed a significant effect \n\non the properties of films produced with FFS of different compositions. Once again, \n\nthe observed effect on these properties reflects changes in the films structure. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.3. FTIR-ATR spectroscopy results \n\nFTIR has been extensively applied for the characterisation of biopolymers, as \n\nthis technique reveals specific information about the molecular structure of chemical \n\ncompounds (Gao et al., 2006; Lawrie et al., 2007). Also, important information about \n\nspecific interactions between the different constituents of the biopolymers can be \n\nextracted from the infrared spectrum. \n\nFigure 2.3 presents the results obtained from FTIR measurements. Figure 2.3a \n\npresents typical spectra of the different films with different compositions. In order to \n\nbetter understand the possible interaction of the different constituents of the films, a \n\nband assignment was performed by comparing the films\u2019 spectrum with the spectra of \n\ntheir pure compounds and comparison with literature results. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 Results obtained from FTIR measurements: a) FTIR measurements with different \n\nchitosan/glycerol percentage, b) representation of the scores resulting from PCA model \n\napplied to the films with different chitosan/ glycerol percentages (1-1%, 2-2% and 3-3% of \n\nchitosan) and c) PC1 and d) PC2 loading profiles plots of films according their \n\nchitosan/glycerol composition. \n\n \n\n \n\n10%\n\n \n50%\n\n \n90%\n\n \n\n10%\n\n50%\n\n \n90%\n\n \n\n10%\n\n \n50%\n\n \n90%\n\n \n\n2%Ch\n\n3%Ch\n\n1%Ch  \n\n \n\n10% Gly \n\n50% \n\n90% Gly \n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\na) b) \n\nc) \nd) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nThe residual lactic acid is evident in all films, as confirmed by a band arising at \n\n1715 cm\n-1\n (Figure 2.3a) corresponding to the C=O from the carboxylic acid stretching \n\n(Lawrie et al., 2007).  \n\nAnalysis of the whole spectra shows differences in the regions between 3400 \n\nand 2815 cm\n-1\n, refining the band with increasing glycerol content. This region \n\ncorresponds to the stretching vibrations of the \u2013O\u2013H and \u2013C\u2013H groups, present in \n\nglycerol (C3H8O3).  \n\nLiterature reports that chitosan with 85% of degree of deacetylation displayed \n\ntwo strong vibration bands at 1645 and 1584 cm\n-1\n; those bands were assigned to \n\namide I and amide II vibrations, respectively. It is also reported that amine \n\ndeformation vibrations usually produce strong to very strong bands in the 1638-1575 \n\ncm\n-1\n region (Lawrie et al., 2007).  \n\nIn a chitosan spectrum, bands arise at 1638 cm\n-1\n and 1583 cm\n\n-1\n corresponding \n\nto the amide I, amine II and to the amine deformation. In Figure 2.3a a big band at \n\n1569 cm\n-1\n, in between of two shoulders at 1631 cm\n\n-1\n and 1529 cm\n\n-1\n, are observed. \n\nThe shift of those bands when compared with the pure chitosan spectrum could be \n\ndue to the NH bending vibration at 1583 cm\n-1\n, which overlaps the amide II. Also, \n\nconsidering the protonation of the amines, which can cause an anti-symmetric \n\ndeformation in the 1625-1560 cm\n-1\n range and a symmetric deformation in the 1550-\n\n1505 cm\n-1\n range, and the amide and amine moieties present in the films, the two \n\nrepresented bands must embody an envelope of at least five bands in close proximity \n\n(Lawrie et al., 2007). \n\nPrevious works have observed that the intensity of the amide II band was \n\nsignificantly affected by the level of plasticiser in a protein based film-films, without \n\nglycerol presenting a broader band\u2019s shape when compared with those with 40% of \n\nplasticiser in its composition (Gao et al., 2006). This observation is in agreement with \n\nthe results presented in Figure 2.3a, where films with lower concentration of glycerol \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\n(10%) in their composition presented a untidy band at 1569 cm\n-1\n, when compared with \n\nthe films with higher plasticiser (50% and 90% of glycerol) in their composition. This \n\nindicates higher molecular vibration in the films with higher plasticiser content, which \n\nmay be correlated by an increase of molecular mobility in these samples. Such \n\nhypothesis is supported by the increase of crystallinity in these samples (Table 2.3), \n\nwith consequent increased free volume. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3b represents the PCA analysis of the films with different \n\ncompositions; this figure confirms the previous results showing that the films form \n\nthree homogenous clusters along the PC1 (reflecting glycerol interaction).  \n\nThe loading profile of PC1 (Figure 2.3c) shows that the separation in the 3 \n\ndifferent clusters is due mainly to the \u2013O\u2013H stretching vibration at 3265 cm-1, the \u2013O\u2013\n\nH bending at 1665 cm\n-1\n, the vibrations of \u2013C\u2013H group at 1433 cm-1, reflecting the \n\nincreased glycerol and water content of the films, and to the C-O stretch vibrations \n\nwith bands between 1300 to 1000 cm\n-1\n range, reflecting differences in the interaction \n\nbetween the different components (chitosan/glycerol/residual lactic acid) depending \n\non film forming solution composition. Figure 2.3d also shows the separation of the \n\nfilms along the PC2 - in this case the contribution for this separation was attributed to \n\nthe chitosan interaction, which increased with FFS chitosan concentration.  \n\nIt is important to notice that the separation of samples within the same cluster \n\ndecreased as the proportion chitosan/glycerol decreases (Table 2.1). This may be \n\ntaken as an indication of chitosan conformational changes within the film with the \n\nincreasing plasticiser agent, and shows the influence of polymer/plasticiser content on \n\nthe film\u2019s final structure. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n2.4. Conclusions  \n\nThe properties of films produced with FFS at 3 different concentrations of \n\nchitosan and 3 different levels of glycerol were measured. \n\nIt was observed that the rheological behaviour of the FFS was chitosan \n\nconcentration dependent. K (and indirectly the molecular entanglement in the solution) \n\naffected the MC and the properties of the films obtained after drying. This may be due \n\nto differences on the drying behaviour during film production and thus significantly \n\naffecting the mechanical and thermal properties of the obtained films. \n\nGlycerol addition caused changes in the films structure, by increasing free \n\nvolume. This was reflected on the mechanical and thermal behaviour of the films and \n\nalso in the barrier and water related properties. Moreover, glycerol affected the \n\ncrystalline lattice of the film, by changing the H-bonds in chitosan crystals. This \n\nconclusion is also supported by the FTIR results, where different interaction groups \n\nwere observed according with the chitosan/glycerol ratios. \n\nThe effect of polysaccharide/plasticiser concentration on the microstructure \n\nand molecular dynamics of polymeric films systems will be a complementary study for \n\nunderstanding the behaviour of these structures. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\nMolecular dynamics, composition and structure analysis  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n53 \n\n \n\nAbstract  \n\nThis chapter has the purpose to investigate the effect of \n\npolysaccharide/plasticiser concentration on the microstructure and molecular \n\ndynamics of polymeric film systems, using transmission electron microscope imaging \n\n(TEM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. Experiments were carried \n\nout in chitosan/glycerol films prepared with solutions of different composition. The \n\nfilms obtained after drying and equilibration were characterised in terms of \n\ncomposition, thickness and water activity.  \n\nResults show that glycerol quantities used in FFS were responsible for films \n\ncomposition; while polymer/total plasticiser ratio in the solution determined the \n\nthickness (and thus structure) of the films. These results were confirmed by TEM.  \n\nNMR allowed understanding the films molecular rearrangement. Two different \n\nbehaviours for the two components analysed, water and glycerol, were observed: the \n\nfirst is predominantly moving free in the matrix, while glycerol is mainly bounded to the \n\nchitosan chain. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nIn the last years nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been presented as a \n\npowerful technique to understand and evaluate molecular mobility of semi crystalline \n\nsystems. Specifically, \n1\nH NMR has been used to investigate water dynamics and \n\nphysical structures of foods through analysis of nuclear magnetisation relaxation times \n\n(Li et al., 2000). In these measurements the samples are submitted to a static \n\nmagnetic field and the protons are excited by means of a radiofrequency pulse. The \n\nanalysis of the signal emitted while the sample returns to equilibrium (FID) allows \n\ndetermining the spin-lattice (T1) and spin-spin or transverse (T2) relaxation. This later \n\nvariable is related with the mobility of the protons in the samples matrix. The stability \n\nof food \u201cmatrix\u201d (system) depends strongly on its molecular mobility (as discussed \n\nbefore) but also on its microstructure. Foods are highly structured and heterogeneous \n\nmaterials composed of architectural elements. The types of such structural units and \n\ntheir interactions are decisive in the food stability, since they influence water/solute \n\ninteractions and hence the water availability to participate in degradation reactions. \n\nMicroscopy techniques have been widely used in foods to study their architecture and \n\nmicrostructure (Aguilera et al., 2000). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) \n\nspecifically, visualises the internal structure of food samples (Kal\u00e1b et al., 1995), \n\nhelping to clarify biological systems dynamics. \n\nEdible films have been studied for a long time for their potential to improve \n\nshelf-life and safety of food products (Aider, 2010; Epure et al., 2011). These systems \n\nare partially crystalline/partially amorphous, easily reproducible materials and are thus \n\nvery interesting food model systems to molecular mobility studies and microstructure \n\nstudies. The addition of low molecular weight plasticisers to amorphous biopolymers \n\nincreases the matrix free volume and the molecular mobility, in an effect similar to \n\nincreasing temperature (Lazaridou and Biliaderis, 2002; Lefebvre and Escaig, \n\n1993).These additives reduce the tension of deformation, hardness, density, viscosity \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nand electrostatic charge of a polymer, at the same time increasing chain flexibility, \n\nresistance and dielectric constant (Ferry, 1980). Plasticisers modify the matrix \n\nsecond-order interactions of materials (which are responsible for polymeric materials \n\ncrystalline structures), without altering their fundamental chemical character. This \n\nmodification is achieved by forming weak second-order or covalent bonds with the \n\npolymer. However, plasticisers can also migrate in the polymer leading to material \n\nrecrystallization and a loss of elasticity (Domjan et al., 2009). In addition plasticisers \n\ncan also affect water retention capacity (Lefebvre and Escaig, 1993).  \n\nWater, considered a plasticiser, is one of the most important solvent medium in \n\nbiological systems (Matveeva et al., 2000). It greatly affects the mobility of \n\nbiopolymers components and is considered as an abundant and very effective \n\nsolvent/plasticiser for hydrophilic materials (Lazaridou and Biliaderis, 2002). On a \n\nmolecular level, water plasticisation of a polymer leads to increased free volume, \n\ndecreased local viscosity and increased back-bone chain mobility (Slade and Levine, \n\n1991).  \n\nChitosan, structurally considered as a semicrystalline biopolymer (Bangyekan \n\net al., 2006; Pillai et al., 2009; Rinaudo, 2006), is a polysaccharide composed mainly \n\nof (1?4) linked residues of N-acetyl ?-d-glucosamine and (1?4) ?-d-.glucosamine \n\n(Arzate-V\u00e1zqueza et al., 2012; Ostrowska-Czubenko and ska, 2009; Prashanth and \n\nTharanathan, 2007; Rinaudo, 2006; Yang et al., 2010). Chitosan crystal structure is \n\nstabilised by intramolecular and intermolecular H-bonds, with the acetamide groups \n\nplaying the major role in the formation of second-order bonds between adjacent \n\nchains (Okuyama et al., 1997), making the chitosan structure on a film very \n\ndependent on the type and quantity of plasticisers used.  \n\nThrough this chapter an effort is made to understand the relationship between \n\nthe composition of FFS and the properties (composition and microstructure) of the \n\nobtained glycerol plasticised chitosan films, evaluating the role of water and glycerol \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\nas plasticiser agents, and the effect of their concentrations in the systems \n\nperformance. Also, we aimed at analysing the molecular mobility of such films, in \n\norder to recognise its properties and improve its suitability as models for more \n\ncomplex food systems. For that purpose, film forming solutions of different \n\npolymer/plasticiser concentrations were prepared and the obtained films characterised \n\nin terms of composition, molecular mobility and microstructure. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n 3.2.1. Chitosan films preparation \n\nChitosan films preparation was performed as described in section 2.2.1. \n\n \n\n 3.2.2. Characterisation of the chitosan films \n\n \n\n3.2.2.1. Chemical composition \n\nThe final composition in chitosan, glycerol and water of the obtained films was \n\ndetermined. Chitosan concentration was estimated using a spectrophotometric \n\nmethod (Muzzarelli, 1998). Briefly, chitosan films were dissolved in 100 mL of lactic \n\nacid solution 4%. Cibacron brilliant red 3B-A from Sigma (Milano, Italy) was used as \n\ndye. A solution of dye was prepared by dissolving 150 mg of the powder in ultra-pure \n\nwater, using a 100 mL volumetric flask. Aliquots of the dye solution (5 mL) were made \n\nup to 100 mL with 0.1 M glycine hydrochloride buffer. Spectrophotometric \n\nmeasurements were done at room temperature and at 575 nm, with a wavelength \n\nspectrophotometer (UV \u2013 1601; Shimadzu Co., Kyoto; Japan). \n\nGlycerol concentration in films was determined using a quantitative enzymatic \n\ndetermination (Free Glycerol Determination Kit, from Sigma, Milano, Italy). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\nSpectrophotometric measurements were performed at room temperature and 540 nm \n\nwavelength, using the same spectrophotometer.  \n\n Water content was determined by difference. \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2.

Nuclear magnetic relaxation \n\nA Bruker AVANCE III solid state spectrometer (300 MHz) was used to \n\ndetermine the samples nuclear transverse relaxation time, or spin-spin, T2, of the \n\nprotons. \n\nThese values were obtained from the exponential or bi-exponential echoes \n\nenvelope of a series of Carr- Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) multi-echo pulse \n\nsequence, which circumvents the field and sample heterogeneities and gives access \n\nto the intrinsic T2 of the protons, while the Free Induction Decay (FID) obtained from a \n\nsingle pulse just gives a T2* determined mainly by the field non-uniformity in the \n\nheterogeneous film sample contained in the NMR 5 mm tubes. \n\nThe analysis of the CPMG echoes envelope showed that the relaxation of the \n\nprotons in chitosan/glycerol films follow a bi-exponential function.

Microstructure \n\nTransmission electron microscope analyses were performed according to a \n\nliterature described methodology (Tapia-Bl\u00e1cido et al., 2011). Small pieces of films \n\nwere prepared by fixation in 20 mL L\n-1\n glutaraldehyde and post-fixed in 20 g L\n\n-1\n OsO4. \n\nSamples were dehydrated for 15 min in an ethanol series (30, 50, 70, 90 mL/100 mL), \n\nthree times for 15 min at 99.5 mL/ 100 mL, and twice for 20 min in propylene oxide. \n\nThe samples were then embedded in increasing concentrations of propylene oxide: \n\nresin (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) for 1 h, and for 48 h in Epon 812 resin. The polymerization of \n\nthe resin subsequently proceeded at 60 \u00baC for 24 h.  \n\nUltrathin sections (40-60 nm thickness) were prepared on a Reichert \n\nSUPERNOVA LEICA Ultramicrotome (Germany) using diamond knives (DDK, \n\nWilmington, DE, USA). The sections were mounted on 300 mesh nickel grids, and \n\nexamined under a JEOL JEM 1400 TEM (Tokyo, Japan). Images were digitally \n\nrecorded using a Gatan SC 1000 ORIUS CCD camera (Warrendale, PA, USA). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n 3.3.1. Composition of the films \n\nDrying is one of the critical processes in film preparation, since during this \n\nprocess, the polymer and/or plasticiser concentrations may change (Wong et al., \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\n2004). In this study, the drying process was kept constant in all films, but film forming \n\nsolutions with different compositions were tested.  \n\nThe composition and thickness of the films obtained after drying are shown in \n\nTable 3.1. It can be observed that the chitosan concentration in the obtained films \n\ndoes not correlate with the chitosan content of the solutions used for preparing each \n\nfilm. For example, films prepared using 1% (w/w) chitosan FFS presented different \n\nfinal polymer content. However, it is possible to find a relationship between the \n\nglycerol added to the FFS and the composition of the obtained film: for solutions with \n\nconstant polymer concentration, when the amount of plasticiser in the solution \n\nincreases, the chitosan content in the film decreases. Moreover, it is possible to \n\nobserve that polymer concentration in the solution is correlated with the thickness of \n\nthe obtained films (Table 3.1), i.e. increasing the content of chitosan in the solution will \n\noriginate thicker films (data in Appendix B, Table B.1.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 Composition and thickness of the films obtained, using different polymer/plasticiser percentages in film forming solutions.  \n\n \n\n\u00b195% Confidence error \n\n \n\n FFS  Films \n\n          \nSamples \n\n \nChit  \n\n \n(g) \n\nGly \n  \n\n(g) \n\nRatio  \n \n\n(Chit/Gly) \n\nChitosan content \n \n\n(mg g\n-1\n\n film) \n \n\nGlycerol content \n \n\n(mg g\n-1\n\n film) \n\nRatio \n \n\n(Chit/ Gly) \n\nWater content \n \n\n (mg g\n-1\n\n film) \n\nThickness  \n \n\n(mm) \n\n         \n1%10% 5 0.63 7.94 388.13\u00b116.885\n\na\n 11.47\u00b10.019\n\n a\n \n\n33.84 \n600.40 0.0642 \n\n1%50% 5 3.15 1.59 196.13\u00b134.261\n a\n 31.68\u00b10.143\n\n a\n \n\n6.19 \n810.17 0.0556 \n\n1%90% 5 5.67 0.88 158.15\u00b121.535\n a\n 47.90\u00b10.058\n\n a\n \n\n3.30 \n755.97 0.0605 \n\n      \n \n\n \n \n\n2%10% 10 1.26 7.94 356.88\u00b123.494\n a\n 13.47\u00b10.027\n\n a\n \n\n26.49 \n629.65 0.1344 \n\n2%50% 10 6.31 1.58 171.85\u00b139.978\n a\n 30.04\u00b10.119\n\n a\n \n\n5.72 \n798.11 0.1357 \n\n2%90% 10 11.40 0.88 164.43\u00b19.240\n a\n 36.72\u00b10.068\n\n a\n \n\n4.20 \n798.85 0.1527 \n\n      \n \n\n \n \n\n3%10% 15 1.89 7.94 388.14\u00b120.396\n a\n 14.72\u00b10.050\n\n a\n \n\n26.37 \n597.14 0.2844 \n\n3%50% 15 9.46 1.59 181.63\u00b130.075\n a\n 46.18\u00b10.039\n\n a\n \n\n3.93 \n772.19 0.2348 \n\n3%90% 15 17.10 0.88 195.71\u00b137.529\n a\n 53.36\u00b10.083\n\n a\n \n\n3.67 \n750.93 0.2452 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\nThese results suggest that films composition is governed by the amount of \n\nplasticiser in the FFS, while the amount of polymer added will influence the structural \n\nrearrangement of the film. i.e., with this work experiment design were obtained films \n\nwith similar composition (chitosan, glycerol and water mg g\n-1\nfilm) with thickness \n\nvarying ca 5 fold. This may indicate that chitosan and plasticiser molecules are \n\narranged in different structures in the matrix, e.g. different crystal size and quantities \n\nand/or types. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, these films (of same \n\ncomposition, but different thickness) presented different crystallinity (evaluated by the \n\nchange in enthalpy (results included in Appendix A, Table A.2.5) and by TEM \n\nobservation (see discussion below). The phenomenon responsible for this observation \n\nis not clear. However, it can be observed that the solutions used to prepare these \n\nfilms had all the same chitosan/glycerol ratio but different chitosan/total plasticiser (i.e. \n\nglycerol + water) ratio. This seems to indicate that this ratio is the one actually \n\nresponsible for the type of bonds and interactions formed during the drying process.  \n\n \n\n 3.3.2. Molecular mobility \n\nMolecular mechanisms that control functionality in polymeric films are still \n\npoorly understood, particularly in chitosan films. Studies on the mobility of the different \n\ncomponents at molecular level in the films matrix may help to explain structural \n\nphenomenon and simultaneously the effect of plasticiser addition. An example \n\nobtained from NMR measurements is shown in Figure 3.1.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 Proton multi-echo acquisition of a chitosan/glycerol sample with a CPMG multi-\n\npulse sequence. The echo envelope is bi-exponential, with a fast and a slow decay of the \n\ntransverse nuclear magnetism. \n\n \n\nResults show that the relaxation of protons in chitosan/glycerol films follow a \n\ntwo components bi-exponential function, indicating the existence of two different \n\npopulations, with distinct relaxation behaviour (Hills et al., 1991) (data included in \n\nAppendix B, Table B.2.1). The two relaxation times determined in each film were \n\nassigned to water and glycerol, as they were the only components with a proton with \n\nthe capacity to move. Considering the relative size of the water and glycerol \n\nmolecules, the higher relaxation time, corresponding to a more mobile molecule, was \n\nassigned to the water proton and the lower relaxation times to the glycerol proton. No \n\nrelaxation attributable to polymer mobility was observed in the obtained spectra, even \n\nif the plasticisers in the system are expected to soften the rigid structure of the \n\nchitosan polymeric chain (Domjan et al., 2009). \n\nAs discussed above, plasticisers are responsible for modifications in \n\nbiopolymers physical properties (Hills et al., 1991). As referred in previous chapters, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\nwater also acts has a plasticiser, since, water molecules can create hydrogen bonds \n\nwith the polymeric chains present in the system, thus increasing the macromolecular \n\nsystem free volume and contributing to a more flexible polymeric chain. In this study, \n\nthe molecular mobility in the films was evaluated using nuclear magnetic resonance \n\ntechniques (NMR) to determine relaxation time of the molecules present in the \n\nsystem. \n\nFigure 3.2a shows the T2 of the water molecules against the composition of \n\nthe different films. It is possible to observe that water relaxation time (T2water), did not \n\nseem to be dependent on the chitosan content in the films, but increases with \n\nincreasing glycerol content. This is due to the plasticiser effect, which reduces the \n\nintermolecular forces and increases the overall mobility in the matrix (Srinivasa et al., \n\n2007). On Figure 3.2b, it is possible to observe that water mobility decreased with \n\nincreasing chitosan/glycerol ratio in the film.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 Films relaxation time (T2) for water molecules as function of different chitosan and \n\nglycerol concentrations (a) and for the ratio chitosan/glycerol in the films (b). Results grouped \n\nfilms of the same final thickness: produced with ? 1%, ? 2% and ? 3% chitosan in the film \n\nforming solutions. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\nA similar effect was observed in starch/glycerol films (Godbillot et al., 2006). In \n\nthis study, the authors postulate that the number of available binding sites in the \n\npolymer chain will be \u201cpreferentially\u201d occupied with glycerol, while water will only \n\noccupy polymer binding sites in the case no sufficient glycerol molecules are \n\navailable. Our results for a chitosan/glycerol system follow the same observation: \n\nwhen the film glycerol content was not sufficient to occupy all the free sites on the \n\npolymer chain, the water molecules presented a decreased relaxation time, indicating \n\nwater is bound to chitosan. When the amount of plasticiser molecules increase, the \n\npolymer binding sites get more and more occupied by the glycerol molecules, leaving \n\nthe water free to move in the chitosan matrix. There was an exception to this \n\nbehaviour: films produced with 2% chitosan and 50% glycerol (marked on Figure 3.2 \n\nwith a circle) presented a much lower T2 than the one observed in films with similar \n\ncomposition, and a deviate behaviour regarding the expected T2 for the determined \n\nratio chitosan/glycerol. This phenomenon has been reported in literature as the \n\nantiplasticisation phenomenon (Lourdin et al., 1997) attributable to a strong interaction \n\noccurring between the polymer and the plasticiser, producing a \u201ccross-linker\u201d effect, \n\nwhich decreases the free volume and the molecular mobility (Lourdin et al., 1997). \n\nIn order to better evaluate the role of polymer, plasticiser and/or water binding \n\nand interactions, were compared the results of water mobility with the films water \n\ncontent and aw (Figure 3.3). Figure 3.3a shows the relationship between water T2 and \n\nwater content of the films. The water molecular mobility increases with water content, \n\nwhich in turn is higher for samples with higher glycerol content. These results confirm \n\nthe above discussed preferred affinity between chitosan and glycerol: i.e. the water \n\nmolecules are free in the matrix to move, because the polymer binding sites are \n\noccupied with glycerol (Godbillot et al., 2006).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Films relaxation time (T2) for water molecules as a function of water content (a) and \n\nwater activity (b). Results grouped by films of same final composition: produced with 10% \n\nglycerol solution (white bullets) and 90% glycerol solution (black bullets). Samples prepared \n\nwith 50% of glycerol are not shown because of the deviant behaviour (antiplasticisation), which \n\nimpairs the data analysis. \n\n \n\nLiterature reports that water in biopolymer systems can be present in three \n\ndifferent states: free in the bulk, at the surface and bound (Hills et al., 1996c). Other \n\nauthors have indicated that water activity is the result of the bulk and surface water \n\n(Mathlouthi, 2001). Since water bounded to the polymeric chain has no mobility, from \n\nour results, it is clear that the measured relaxation time refers to the water in the bulk: \n\nin films of the same composition (same total water content) the increase in water \n\nactivity (water at the surface and in the bulk) does not reflect on water mobility (Figure \n\n3.3b). This observation may be of great value for studies on degradation reactions in \n\nfood systems and contribute for understanding differences in the stability of foods with \n\nsame aw.  \n\nIn respect to the mobility of glycerol, different tendencies were observed \n\n(Figure 3.4). Glycerol T2 decreased with increasing of chitosan concentrations, \n\nespecially for the higher concentrations, again suggesting that glycerol may be closely \n\na) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nbond to the chitosan chain network (Figure 3.4a). This is in accordance with the \n\nresults above described. Again, it is possible to observe the antiplasticisation \n\nphenomenon in the films produced with 2% of chitosan and 50% of glycerol (also \n\nmarked with a circle). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Films relaxation time (T2) for glycerol molecules of: a) different chitosan and glycerol \n\nconcentration, and b) glycerol content (mg g\n-1\n\nfilm). Films produced with ? 1%, ? 2% and ? 3% chitosan in \n\nthe film forming solutions, each group corresponding to thickness of the obtained film. Again, \n\nantiplasticised samples are not shown. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 3.4b it is possible to observe the relationship between glycerol \n\nmobility and glycerol content of films, grouped by films of similar thickness. It shows \n\nthat for films with the same thickness, glycerol mobility increases with increasing \n\nglycerol content. However, comparing films with approximately the same amount of \n\nglycerol, T2 decreases with increasing thickness of the film (see for example the data \n\npoints highlighted with a dashed circle). At a first glance these results are unexpected: \n\nthe films present approximately the same amount of chitosan, which would imply that \n\nan increase in thickness means an increase of the free volume in the matrix. \n\nHowever, the thicker films are produced with less water molecules per chitosan \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nmolecules in the FFS and thus it is possible that during the drying process more \n\nglycerol molecules bind to the polymeric chain \u2013 hence glycerol is not free to move in \n\nthe matrix of the obtained film. This result supports our previous hypothesis that the \n\nratio polymer/total plasticiser in the FFS is critical for the type of bonds formed during \n\nthe films drying. \n\n \n\n 3.3.3. Microstructure \n\nAs discussed above, in this study were obtained films with similar composition \n\nand significantly different thickness (Table 3.1), which may indicate differences in the \n\nfilms structure. To investigate such possibility, the films were observed using TEM. \n\nThis microscopy technique allows characterising the interior of the films since the \n\nelectron beam is transmitted through the sample, allowing specific observation of \n\nstructures in the sample (Andreuccetti et al., 2009; Denavi et al., 2009; Tapia-Bl\u00e1cido \n\net al., 2011).  \n\nChitosan films transmission electron images are presented in Figure 3.5, which \n\nshows the films semicrystalline structure. The black aggregates represent the \n\ncrystalline component, whereas the homogeneous crowd corresponds to the \n\namorphous constituent of the sample. As above, samples images are grouped by \n\nfilms with similar composition and films with similar thickness.  \n\nImages show that the films with similar thickness present similar structures, \n\nwith visible crystals decreasing with decreasing chitosan content: i.e. films produced \n\nwith 1% chitosan FFS have clearly evident crystals, scattered in matrix, showing a \n\nheterogeneous feature. As the chitosan content decreases, crystals are not anymore \n\nobserved in the obtained images. However, this may not correspond to an absence of \n\ncrystals in the samples: the crystals may be smaller than the resolution of the \n\nequipment.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 TEM micrographs of the films produced with different polymer/plasticiser \n\nconcentrations. \n\n \n\nFurthermore, films with the same thickness were prepared by FFS with the \n\nsame chitosan content (see Table 3.1). This confirms the above hypothesis that it is \n\nthe chitosan-water ratio in the FFS that define the quantity/type of structures formed in \n\nthe film. These structures are important, because they may interfere with transport \n\nphenomena in the film and how they are formed can be important information for \n\nfunctional films development. For films with similar composition, there is no apparent \n\nrelationship with the structures visible in the image, which may be an indication that \n\nfilm composition may not be related with the functionality at macroscopic level (Vargas \n\net al., 2011). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n69 \n\n \n\nThe results of the microstructure observations also confirm the discussions \n\nabove on the polymer-plasticiser-water interactions and their effect on the molecular \n\nmobility: the films with more visible crystals correspond to the films with higher water \n\nrelaxation times (higher free volume) \u2013 i.e. in the films where chitosan binding sites \n\nare \u201coccupied\u201d by polymer-polymer interactions in the crystalline lattice, the water and \n\nglycerol molecules are free to move in the matrix. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n3.4. Conclusions \n\nResults from this chapter demonstrated that glycerol quantities used in film \n\nforming solutions were responsible for chitosan concentration obtained in films and, \n\nconsequently for films composition; while film forming solutions polymer/total \n\nplasticiser ratio determined the thickness (and thus structure) of the films and these \n\nconclusions were confirmed by TEM. These results can be useful for the development \n\nof edible films of improved functionality. \n\nResults on molecular mobility contributed to the understanding of the films \n\nmolecular rearrangement. NMR measurements showed two different behaviours for \n\nthe two components analysed, water and glycerol: while glycerol is mainly bounded to \n\nthe chitosan chain network, the water present in the system is predominantly free from \n\nthe polymeric chain. However, it was possible to infer that for lower glycerol \n\nconcentrations, free chitosan binding sites can also be occupied by water molecules.  \n\nWater content and aw measurements also allowed concluding that not only the \n\nwater content affects the water mobility, but also structural differences in the film may \n\ninfluence the water relaxation time. Also it was possible to observe that water mobility \n\nrelates to the water in the bulk and thus complements information on water activity of \n\na system.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\nMolecular dynamics and functional properties \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nFoods, from a fundamental perspective, are partially crystalline partially \n\namorphous systems. Edible films are considered good models for food systems, \n\nbecause of their interesting physical properties, quite straightforward matrices, and \n\neasy reproduction. Chitosan has been thoroughly used in edible films studies. \n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to investigate the relationship between the \n\nmolecular relaxation time in chitosan films, their microstructure (crystallinity) and \n\nfunctional properties. Analyses were carried out using data on chitosan/ glycerol films \n\nprepared with different polymer/plasticiser concentration.  \n\nIn general, results demonstrate that there is a relationship between \n\nmacroscopic properties and water and glycerol relaxation times. Moreover, results \n\nalso show that while water is free in matrix, glycerol is linked to the chitosan polymeric \n\nchains, decreasing intermolecular attractions and increasing free volume, thus \n\nfacilitating molecular migration. Also the data analysis reveals the usefulness of NMR \n\nand molecular mobility studies in the matrix for characterisation and development of \n\npolymeric structures.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\nFoods are essentially semicrystalline matrices, basically composite materials \n\nwith crystalline and noncrystalline regions (Jeck et al., 2012; Spathis and Kontou, \n\n1998), whose configuration exhibit remarkably complex arrangements at the \n\nmolecular scale (Cort\u00e9 and Leibler, 2007). \n\nThe glass transition temperature concept has been applied in food science and \n\ntechnology research (Slade and Levine, 1991) and recognises the noncrystalline \n\n(amorphous) or partially crystalline state of solid foods, and solids plasticisation by \n\nwater. This concept, that links food stability and glass transition, has been extensively \n\nstudied by the food science and technology community, in order to better understand \n\nthe molecular mobility point of view. Molecular mobility is considered a fundamental \n\nparameter in knowledge and understanding the dynamic properties of food \n\ncomponents (Roudaut et al., 2004) Nowadays, in order to better understand this \n\nparameter, NMR is being used as a powerful technique to understand and evaluate \n\nmolecular mobility of semicrystalline systems, including food systems, since it is able \n\nto provide information on molecular dynamics of different components in complex \n\nsystems (Domjan et al., 2009) \n\nAs it was mentioned before, the stability of a food system depends strongly on \n\nits molecular mobility. Thus, studies on relaxation times of food matrices components \n\n(mainly water) and its correlation with macroscopic properties seems to be of great \n\nvalue for studies on degradation reactions and can, as an example, contribute to \n\nunderstand differences in the stability of foods with the same water activity. \n\nConsequently, it is useful to determine how molecular mobility modulates such \n\nproperties of foods (Ludescher et al., 2001). These studies are also of great interest in \n\nedible films, since they are models for more complex food systems, and also very \n\nuseful products in food technology. Chitosan is a polymer that has been widely used \n\ndue to its characteristics, namely its excellent filmogenic properties (Aider, 2010; \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\nMart\u00ednez-Camacho et al., 2010; Rinaudo, 2006) It is of great interest to fully \n\ncharacterise the solid state physical and physicochemical properties of chitosan films, \n\nincluding the molecular mobility that occurs within the polymeric structure, in both \n\nwide temperature and time scale ranges (Viciosa et al., 2004). Moreover, the \n\nmolecular mechanisms that control functionality in polymeric films, like chitosan, are \n\npoorly understood and it is important to clarify the solid-state structure and molecular \n\nmobility for better understanding of the physical properties of semicrystalline matrices \n\n(Kuwabara et al., 2004).  \n\nThe objective of this chapter was to systematically evaluate the link between \n\nmolecular mobility and the thermo-mechanical properties in water glycerol plasticised \n\nchitosan films, as semicrystalline matrices. \n\n \n\n4.2. Materials and methods \n\nThe data used for the analysis presented in this chapter was reported \n\npreviously in chapters 2 and 3. Briefly, chitosan/glycerol films were prepared with \n\nsolutions of different polymer and plasticiser concentrations. The thermal, mechanical \n\nand water permeability properties of the obtained films after drying and equilibration \n\nwere determined. The transverse relaxation time of the protons was also determined \n\nusing NMR, showing two main proton populations corresponding to water and \n\nglycerol. \n\n \n\n4.3. Results and discussion \n\nThe composition and thickness of the films, resulting from the different \n\nchitosan/glycerol combinations used in FFS preparation, are presented in Table 4.1. It \n\ncan be observed that films with the same composition can present different thickness \n\n(this was dependent on the ratio polymer/plasticiser of the FFS), i.e. the same amount \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\nof molecules can be more or less dispersed in the matrix. It indicates that in these \n\nfilms the polymer may be re-arranged in different structures. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \n\nPolymer/plasticiser/water composition and thickness of films produced with different \n\nformulations. \n\n \n\n \n\n 4.3.1. Molecular mobility versus thermal properties \n\nFigure 4.1a and b present, respectively, chitosan films water T2 and glycerol T2 \n\nas a function of Tg). Glass transition temperature can be correlated with the molecules \n\nmobility in matrices, since it is considered the macroscopic manifestation of \n\ncooperative changes in the molecular mobility (Ludescher et al., 2001).  \n\nBoth plasticisers (water and glycerol) had similar behaviour. However, water \n\npresented transverse relaxation times 10 times higher than the glycerol relaxation \n\ntimes, for the same glass transition temperature (i.e. for the same film). This is related \n\nwith the available binding sites in the polymer chain that are preferentially occupied \n\nFFS Films \n\n            \nSamples Chit  \n\n \n(g) \n\nGly \n  \n\n(g) \n\nRatio  \n \n\n(Chit/ \nGly) \n\nChit content Gly content \n \n \n\nRatio \n \n\n(Chit/ Gly) \n\nWater \ncontent \n\n \n ( mg g\n\n-1\nfilm ) \n\nThickness  \n \n\n(mm) \n\nChit  \n(%) \n\nGly \n(%) \n\n   mg g\n-1\n\nfilm average mg g\n-1\n\nfilm average    \n\n            \n1 10 5 0.63 7.94 388.13 388.13 11.47 13.10 33.84 600.40 0.0642 \n3 10 15 1.89 7.94 388.14 14.72  26.37 597.14 \n\n0.2844 \n\n            \n\n1 50 5 3.15 1.59 196.13 188.88 31.68 38.93 6.19 810.17 0.0556 \n3 50 15 9.46 1.59 181.63 46.18  3.93 772.19 0.2348 \n\n            \n\n1 90 5 5.67 0.88 158.15 176.96 47,90 50.60 3.30 755.97 0.0605 \n3 90 15 17.10 0.88 195.71 53,.36  3.67 750.93 0.2452 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\nwith glycerol, leaving the water molecules free to move in the system (Godbillot et al., \n\n2006). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Films water (a) and glycerol (b) relaxation time (T2), at room temperature, as a \n\nfunction of glass transition temperature (Tg).

Literature \n\nreports that the presence of crystals can change the properties of the amorphous \n\nregions. This is because the polymeric chain is organised in the crystalline lattice and \n\nthe polymer binding sites are \u201coccupied\u201d with polymer-polymer bonds. As such, two \n\nfactors contribute to the increase of the transverse relaxation time with crystallinity: i) \n\nthe free volume of the system increases, and ii) the water and glycerol molecules are \n\nfree to move in the matrix.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-176.96 Chit and 50.60Gly  - 388.13 Chit and 13.10Gly;   - 188.88 Chit and 38.93Gly;  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n79 \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Molecular mobility versus mechanical properties \n\nThe relationship between molecular mobility and films structure is also \n\nobserved on the mechanical properties. Figure 4.3 presents the water (a) and (c) and \n\nglycerol (b) and (d) relaxation times as a function of EB and TS.  \n\nThese properties are critical for films development, since they reflect their \n\nability to perform in different applications (Chen and Hwa, 1996; Leceta et al., 2013). It \n\ncan be observed that when T2 increases, EB increases in an exponential relationship, \n\nwhile TS decreases also exponentially \u2013 showing clearly an effect of molecular \n\nmobility on mechanical properties. Above, it was concluded that films with higher \n\nmolecular relaxation times are more crystalline and have more free volume. Figure 4.3 \n\nallows also to conclude that these films are more deformable (high EB) and easier to \n\nbreak (low TS). Again, the molecular bonds and molecular rearrangement are the key \n\npoint. In such systems there are two main types of bonds: i) strong polymer/polymer \n\ninteractions, and ii) weak polymer/plasticisers and plasticiser/plasticiser bonds. A \n\nsimilar co-relation between increased crystallinity on the mechanical properties has \n\nbeen reported in the literature (Bourbon et al., 2011; Ziani et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n80 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 Films water and glycerol relaxation time (T2) as a function of EB (respectively, \n\nFigures 4.3a and b) and TS (respectively, Figures 4.3c and d).

Molecular mobility versus water vapour permeability \n\nFigure 4.4 displays water (a) and glycerol (b) T2 against WVP. It is possible to \n\nobserve two different behaviours depending on the studied film thickness.  \n\nFor thicker chitosan films (range between 0.2348 and 0.2844 mm), WVP \n\nincreases with T2, and this may be related with the increase of Brownian motion in the \n\nmatrix with higher mobility, thus increasing the Fickian mass transport phenomena \n\n(Pinheiro et al., 2013), i.e. higher molecular mobility makes the diffusion of water \n\nthrough the film easier. For the thinner films (range between 0.0556 and 0.0642mm), \n\nWVP is almost constant, with no apparent correlation with molecular mobility. This \n\nmay be due to a lower resistance to mass transport \u2013 making the structural \n\ndifferences in the matrix not sufficient to influence the mass transfer rate (Crank, \n\n1975).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 Films water (a) and glycerol (b) relaxation time (T2) as a function of water vapour \n\npermeability (WVP).

This effect has been \n\nreported in the literature (McHugh et al., 1993; Zivanovic et al., 2007) and was \n\nattributed to an increase of the relative humidity in vicinity of the films, altering the \n\nwater vapour kinetics. \n\nWVP increases with crystallinity (larger absolute values of ?h) (Figure 4.5), \n\nagain supporting that for samples with higher crystallinity there is a higher free volume \n\nin the matrix. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 Samples crystallinity (?h) as function as water vapour permeability (WVP).

Conclusions \n\nThe relationship between the T2, the microstructure and the macroscopic \n\nproperties of water/glycerol plasticised chitosan films was systematically analysed and \n\ndiscussed.  \n\nAt room temperature, T2 decreases with the increase of Tg, according to \n\nclassic polymer theory. The crystallinity increased with increasing water and glycerol \n\nmobility, showing that once the polymeric chains are organised in the crystalline \n\nlattice, the interaction polymer/plasticiser is minimised, the free volume of the system \n\nincreases and the water and glycerol molecules are thus free to move in the matrix.  \n\nThe deformability (EB) increased with water and glycerol relaxation times, \n\nwhile TS decreased, showing again the impact of the polymer/polymer and \n\npolymer/plasticiser bonds effect on the properties of the system. WVP was also \n\ncorrelated with molecular mobility. This was dependent on films thickness; in thicker \n\nfilms WVP increases with relaxation time \u2013 indicating that the molecular mobility is \n\nrelated with the Brownian motion in the matrix, hence making the diffusion of water \n\nthrough the film easier; for the thinner films no apparent correlation with molecular \n\nmobility was found.  \n\nAll these results show the usefulness of NMR and molecular mobility studies \n\nfor characterising and developing polymeric structures with improved functionality. \n\nMoreover, such concept can be associated to food science and be of great value for \n\nstudies on degradation reactions and stability of more complex food systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPART III \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\nStudies on fresh-cut fruit \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n89 \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nMolecular mobility is a fundamental parameter which reflects the dynamic \n\nproperties of food components and contributes to food degradation reactions \n\ncomprehension. Fresh-cut fruits have become an important food market segment. \n\nHowever, processing of fruits promotes faster physiological deterioration, biochemical \n\nchanges and microbial degradation. The purpose of this chapter was to use NMR \n\nmethodology as a tool to evaluate fresh-cut fruit quality, during storage at refrigerated \n\nconditions. The fresh-cut melon and pear transverse relaxation times (T2) were \n\nmeasured for a period of 7 days of storage, at 5 \u00baC. The relationship between the \n\nobtained values, microstructure and quality parameters was investigated. In general, \n\nresults show the existence of one class of water fluidity in the system, the one present \n\nin cells after processing. T2, a measure of this fluidity, is affected by processing and \n\nstorage time. Also, a close relationship between T2 and quality parameters of total \n\ncolour difference (TCD), firmness and aw was found. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n5.1. Introduction \n\nStability of biological systems, including foods, depends strongly on molecular \n\nmobility (Roudaut et al., 2004) and water \u201cavailability\u201d. This availability is a \n\nmanifestation of how freely water molecules can participate in reactions, namely \n\ndegradation reactions (Ruan and Chen, 1998). Water activity has been considered, \n\nfor a long time, as a primary guideline for safety and quality control of foods (Labuza, \n\n1977). However, the limitation of this measurement has been expressed (Hills et al., \n\n1996a; Mathlouthi, 2001; Slade and Levine, 1991), and nuclear magnetic resonance \n\nspectroscopy has evolved to become a powerful tool to probe the structure and \n\ndynamics of food constituents in solid state. Specifically, \n1\nH NMR has been used to \n\ninvestigate water dynamics and physical structure of foods through analysis of nuclear \n\nmagnetisation relaxation times (Li et al., 2000). Foods and biological materials consist \n\nlargely of water and macromolecules rich in protons and, since water protons are \n\nmajor contributors to the proton relaxation, the interactions between water and \n\nmacromolecules represent the most important factors affecting the proton relaxation \n\nprocess (Ludescher et al., 2001). In this way, this could be an interesting technique to \n\nevaluate food quality during storage period, since degradation reactions, water \n\ninteractions, structure and chemical compounds changes result in altered NMR \n\nproperties (Ludescher et al., 2001).  \n\nMinimally processed fruit has become an important market segment due to the \n\nincreasing demand for fresh, healthy and convenient foods (Rico et al., 2007). \n\nHowever, it is well known that processing fruits enhances physiological and \n\nbiochemical changes, and microbial degradation, which result in degradation of fruit \n\ncolour and texture. Fresh-cut melon and pear degradation during storage may be \n\ncharacterised by many physical and chemical parameters, such as changes in colour, \n\nfirmness, aroma (Oms-Oliu et al., 2008) and aw. Due to processing operations, a great \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n91 \n\n \n\nnumber of cells are disrupted, which induces the release of enzymes and their \n\nsubstrates resulting in accelerated quality losses. \n\nThe purpose of this chapter was to utilize NMR parameters to evaluate water \n\nbehaviour in fresh-cut melon and pear along refrigerated storage and find and \n\nunderstand a relationship between water molecular dynamics and some of the most \n\nimportant physiological quality parameters, i.e. colour and softening rate. \n\nMaterial and methods will be presented as a common section while results and \n\ndiscussion will be separate in section A for melon and section B for pear. Due to the \n\nbiochemical and structural differences between samples, separate sections will be \n\nhelpful for the interpretation and explanation of the results. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n 5.2.1 Fruit material, processing, packaging and storage conditions \n\n\u2018Piel de Sapo\u2019 melons and \u2018Rocha\u2019 pear were obtained at a local supermarket, \n\nat commercial maturity. In order to characterise the fruit initial maturity state, soluble \n\nsolids content was determined using a refractometer method (Amaro, 2012; \n\nSimandjuntak et al., 1996). Fruits were carefully inspected for bruising and \n\ncompression damage and only those without visual defects and uniform in shape and \n\nsize were selected for processing and analysis. \n\nMelon and pear fruits were washed in running cold water, dipped in 100 \u00b5g L\n?1\n\n \n\nhypochlorite solution for 2 min, rinsed with deioniser water and allowed to drain. All \n\ncutting tools and containers were sanitised with 70% ethanol and allowed to dry \n\nbefore usage. \n\nThe melon rind was removed with a sharp stainless steel knife, the blossom \n\nand stem ends were discarded, placental tissue and seeds were removed, and the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n92 \n\n \n\nmesocarp was prepared in cubes of 2.5 cm\n3\n. Pears were cut into longitudinal slices \n\n(ca. 10\u201320 mm thick) also with a sharp stainless steel knife. \n\nMelon cubes or pear slices were randomly placed in vented polypropylene \n\nclamshells (~175 g) and stored at 5 \u00baC for 7 days. To avoid the accumulation of \n\nethylene and carbon dioxide inside the packages (Vilas-Boas and Kader, 2007), \n\nclamshells were perforated with single 6 mm vents. Samples were analysed at \n\ndifferent days after cutting preparation. \n\n \n\n 5.2.2. Transverse relaxation times measurements \n\nA Bruker AVANCE III solid state NMR spectrometer (300MHz for proton) was \n\nused to determine the samples transverse or spin-spin relaxation times, T2. The \n\ntransverse relaxation time was obtained with a Carr-Prucell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) \n\npulse sequence with a 90\u00ba-180\u00ba pulse spacing of 500 ms and a repetition time of 15 s. \n\nThe magnetisation was recorded after 18 echoes arrays, with the precaution that the \n\nnumber of echoes always permits to define an exponential decay for the \n\nmagnetisation. The samples were cut in small cylinders, 1.5 cm high, and placed in a \n\n5 mm standard NMR tube, for the T2 measurement. \n\nFor each sampling day after cutting, three samples were studied for their \n\ntransverse relaxation time evaluation. \n\n \n\n 5.2.3. Microscope techniques \n\nOptical and scanning electron microscopes were used to observe any \n\nmicrostructural changes that occurred in fruit samples during storage. Hence, at each \n\nstorage time (0, 2, 4 and 6 days), a thin surface layer of the fruits tissue was removed, \n\nat 3 different sections and in duplicate, for both type of microscopy techniques. \n\nFor the optical microscopy, the fruit sample was emerged to staining, in a \n\nsolution of toluidine blue O at 0.5% (w/v), for 2 hours. The stain solution was \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n93 \n\n \n\ndisposed, and the fruits stained portions were washed in ethanol at 97%, during 10 \n\nseconds, and then washed with water during 30 seconds. Then the stained tissues \n\nwere dried in microscope slides in a desiccator, during 24 hours. After this time, \n\nvisualisation was made using a final magnification of 400 times.  \n\nTypical fixation of the material for SEM investigations involves dehydration, \n\nwhich can remove or alter lipids that form the wax coating on the fruit surface, and \n\ncritical point drying can shrink and destroy tissues. Therefore, a modified and \n\nsimplified methodology was used in order to prevent destruction of the epicuticular \n\nwax. The cut samples were wiped with a paper towel, carefully mounted onto stubs \n\nand examined under a JEOL-5600 Lv microscope (Tokyo, Japan), operated under low \n\nvacuum mode, using a spot size of 30 and a potential of 10-15 kV. All analyses were \n\nperformed at room temperature (20 ?C), using a 200 times magnification. For both \n\ntechniques, photographs were obtained of three sections cut from each fruit \n\n \n\n 5.2.4. Measuring quality parameters \n\nThe fruit quality parameters evaluated were total colour difference (TCD), \n\nsoftening rate and water activity.  \n\nColour of the fresh-cut fruit surface was measured in the CIE L*a*b* colour \n\nspace with a Konica-Minolta CR-400 chromameter (Osaka, Japan) equipped with a \n\nD65 illuminant and the 2\u00ba observer for colour interpretation. In this scale, L* ranges \n\nfrom 0 (black) to 100 (white), a* indicates the degree of greenness (for negative \n\nvalues) and the degree of redness (for positive values). Axis b* also ranges from \n\nnegative to positive values indicating, respectively, degree of blueness to yellowness. \n\nL*0, a*0 and b*0 were evaluated from freshly cut fruit (time 0). Colour changes were \n\nassessed using TCD, calculated through the formula \n\n \n\nTCD=? (L*-Lo*) 2+ (a*-ao*) 2+ (b*-bo*) 2                                                         (5.1) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\nOne measurement was made in each five melon cubes and pear slices from \n\nthree duplicated clamshells per replicate.  \n\nFirmness was measured using a TA-XT2 Plus texture analyser (Stable Micro \n\nSystems, Surrey, UK) equipped with a 5 kg load cell. The force to drive a cylindrical \n\nprobe, with 5 mm diameter to perforate 5 mm into the tissue, at a speed of 1.5 mm s\n-1\n \n\nwas recorded (Amaro et al., 2013). One measurement was taken on the lateral \n\nsurfaces of each five cubes/slices from three clamshells, respecting to one replicate, \n\nfrom a total of two replicates, for each sampling day. \n\nWater activity was measured using a dew point hygrometer (Aqualab Series 3, \n\nDecagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Three measurements were performed for \n\neach replicate and for each sampling day. \n\nThe quality data was subjected to statistical analysis performed using the \n\nsoftware packages STASTICS\u00a9 6.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). An individual package \n\nconstituted an experimental unit which was used as one replicate on each sampling \n\nday. Three replicated packages were analysed.

Results and discussion \n\nMaturity stage is an important factor that may affect the intensity of wound \n\nresponse in fresh-cut tissues (Beaulieu and Lea, 2007; Watada and Qi, 1999). These \n\nvariances in samples maturity stage contribute, along with the natural variability \n\nbetween complex biological systems, for the differences obtained between the \n\nreplicates. To characterise the melon maturity stage, the soluble solids content (SSC) \n\nwas measured. The initial SSC ranged between 8.6 and 10.6, with no significant \n\ndifferences observed throughout storage. Melon SSC undergoes minor changes \n\nduring postharvest storage of whole or fresh-cut fruit (Portela and Cantwell, 1998).  \n\n \n\n 5A.3.1. Transverse relaxation times \n\nT2 of the samples was obtained with the purpose of evaluating water \n\nmolecules dynamics and environment during the fruit storage degradation process. \n\nThe CPMG data was analysed as a continuous distribution of exponential relaxation \n\ntimes with CONTIN program (Provencher, 1982), and the results are presented in \n\nFigure 5A.1 (data in Appendix C, Table C.1.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n98 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5A.1 Distribution of water relaxation time (T2) in fresh-cut melon measured at 300 MHz \n\nand room temperature. \n\n \n\nIt is clear from Figure 5A.1 that all values of T2 range from about 50 ms to very \n\nhigh values (<10 s) presented in the samples, with only one pronounced maximum. In \n\nthe first 24 hours after processing, the maximum amplitude T2 value evolves from 329 \n\nto 285 ms. At the third day of storage, the maximum amplitude T2 value is 382 ms and \n\nafter that remains unchanged at 442 ms until day 7. \n\nComparing Figure 5A.1 with the results on whole apples, kiwifruits and pears, \n\nreported elsewhere (Hern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2007; Hills and Remigereau, 1997; \n\nTylewicz et al., 2011), where pools of water are attributed to vacuole, cytoplasm and \n\ncellular wall, in our experiment, only one peak for water relaxation times was detected, \n\nprobably due to loss of cellular compartmentation, as a consequence of wounding.  \n\nRegarding the maximum amplitude, T2 value shifts to shorter values in the first \n\n24 hours after processing. Literature reports that after wounding there is major tissue \n\ndisruption, whereby enzymes and substrates sequestered in different organelles come \n\ninto contact (Beaulieu and Gorny, 2001) and signalling-induced wound responses are \n\ninitiated with microbiological, enzymatic, and physicochemical reactions \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n99 \n\n \n\nsimultaneously taking place, decreasing water availability (Art\u00e9s et al., 2007) \n\npossibility due to an increase in \u2018water binding\u2019 (Chen et al., 1997), as the subcellular \n\nstructures are disrupted and the release of solutes that were retained in the organelles \n\noccurs, and the consequent association of these solutes with water through hydrogen \n\nbonds. After this 24 hour period, where metabolic rate is elevated, water is \n\ncontinuously released from the physical barriers in the system and the observed T2  is \n\nmore often at values closer to the free water T2. By day 4 of storage, T2 maximum \n\namplitude occurs for the highest T2 value and remained constant until the end of \n\nstorage. This may indicate that by day 4 of storage, cells reach a threshold where \n\nmetabolic rate is decreased, wounding reactions are diminished along with increased \n\nmembrane degradation and turgor loss. These alterations lead to a higher water \n\ntransverse relaxation time expression in cells. This interpretation is according with \n\nquality changes data obtained and discussed in point 5A.3.3.  \n\nThe maximum amplitude T2 value evolving to higher T2 values with storage \n\ntime can be interpreted as the enhanced range of water relaxation time detected and \n\nattributed to cell structure disorder due to the occurrence of membrane rupture and \n\nplasmolise (Toivonen and Brummel, 2008). Once this water proton behaviour \n\nindicates an alteration in cellular structure and also in water solute bonds, which can \n\nbe associated with fresh-cut fruits quality loss during the storage period. This relation \n\nwill be explored in the following sections. \n\n \n\n \n\n 5A.3.2. Microstructure analysis \n\nThe use of two different techniques allows obtaining complementary results: \n\nwith light microscope (LM) it is possible to get a qualitative description of the samples \n\nstructure, while scanning electron microscope (SEM) is used to examine surfaces, \n\nwith an improved resolution (Kal\u00e1b et al., 1995).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n100 \n\n \n\nFigure 5A.2 presents the LM photos of the transversal cuts of fresh-cut melon \n\n(complementary microscope images in Appendix C, Section C.2.1). Toluidine Blue, \n\nused as dye, is especially useful for examination of fruit tissues, more specifically the \n\nfruit parenchyma cells, which constitute the fruit mesocarp (Kal\u00e1b et al., 1995). At day \n\n0 of storage, intercellular spaces and vesicles are visible in fresh-cut melon mesocarp. \n\nAll spaces presented are round and turgid with a visible cellular wall structure. This \n\nvisual definition is mainly attributed to the water inside the cells. By day 4 of storage, it \n\nis already possible to observe a decrease in cell wall strength, which could be related \n\nwith its pectin solubilising (Fernandes et al., 2008). The observed changes correlate \n\nwith the T2 distribution function, discussed in the previous section, and are also \n\nsupported by the changes in the quality parameters measurements discussed below \n\n(see section 5A.3.3). \n\nAs for the images obtained with SEM, Figure 5A.2 shows, for day 0, closely \n\nbonded cells and defined cellular walls, reinforcing the results obtained with LM. In \n\nfact, it is actually possible to observe chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are an important \n\ncellular organelle, as they contain chlorophylls and carotenoids that are pigments \n\nresponsible for melon colour, as discussed in section 5A.3.3. After 4 days of storage, \n\nimage shows a great number of cell walls broken down and the few remaining cells \n\nwith severely distorted walls. This phenomenon stimulates the cellular disorganisation \n\nand cell size and shape variations. The cell plasmolise is also seen superficially by \n\nSEM, and confirms the observations of optical microscopy. Also after day 4, the \n\nobservation of chloroplasts becomes more difficult. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n101 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5A.2 Light and scanning electron microscope images of fresh-cut melon, at different \n\ndays of storage.

Quality parameters \n\nAs discussed in the introduction section, colour, firmness and water activity are \n\nconsidered important parameters in fresh-cut fruit quality assessment (Figure 5A.3) \n\n(results in Appendix C, Table C.3.1).

As \n\nexpected, and in accordance with literature (Toivonen and Brummel, 2008), TCD \n\nincreases with storage time. In the specific case of fresh-cut melon, changes in colour \n\nare attributed to different biochemical processes, mainly chlorophyll and carotenoids \n\ndegradation, since melon is not very susceptible to surface browning (Munira et al., \n\n2013; Toivonen and Brummel, 2008). The increase in colour changes observed during \n\nfresh-cut melon storage is generally attributed to translucency or water-soaking \n\nsymptoms (Munira et al., 2013; Portela and Cantwell, 1998). Particularly, literature \n\nreported (Portela and Cantwell, 1998), also for a non-climacteric melon, that colour is \n\nattributed to the combination of low concentration of carotenoids and chlorophylls in \n\nplastids, that are inside the chloroplasts. As the storage time increases and the \n\nplastids degradation occurs, the pigment concentrations in melon changes and \n\nconsequently so does colour.  \n\nFresh-cut melon firmness during the storage period is shown in Figure 5A.3b. \n\nResults demonstrate a rapid increase in firmness loss with storage time, particularly \n\nuntil day 4 of storage. At the end of storage, samples showed a degree of firmness \n\naround 30% (expressed as percentage of loss compared with the firmness measured \n\nat day 0). These changes in melon cubes firmness during storage were already \n\nreported for other melon cultivars and also for \u2018Piel de Sapo\u2019 (Aguayo et al., 2004). \n\nFresh-cut melon is very susceptible to softening during storage, even under low \n\ntemperatures, due to enzymatic degradation of the cell wall, specifically the middle \n\nlamella, and to loss of cell adhesion (Toivonen and Brummel, 2008). The enhanced \n\nactivity of melon cell wall hydrolases in the first hours after processing, along with the \n\ntransformation of protopectin to water-soluble pectin, lead to later alterations in \n\nstructural features, namely thickness of the cell wall size and shape of cells, and \n\nvolume of intercellular spaces (Rojas et al., 2001; Toivonen and Brummel, 2008) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n104 \n\n \n\nThese modifications are according to the observed light and scanning microscope \n\nimages, presented in Figure 5A.2. \n\nFigure 5A.3c shows fresh-cut melon samples water activity decreasing along \n\nstorage. Literature reports water activity as a parameter for food stability control, \n\nnamely chemical reactions in foods (Labuza, 1977). As discussed in section 5A.3.1 \n\nthe decrease in this parameter may be due to the fact that water is being used for the \n\nphysic and biochemical degradation reactions and/or microbial growth, occurring \n\nduring the storage period.  \n\n \n\n 5A.3.4. Relaxation time versus quality parameters \n\nIn Figure 5A.4 it is possible to observe the behaviour tendency between \n\nmaximum distribution T2 value and fresh-cut melon quality parameters, TCD, \n\nsoftening rate and water activity. Figure 5A.4a) shows the maximum distribution T2 \n\nvalue against the total colour difference. Although a weak tendency was noticed, it is \n\npossible to observe T2 increasing with TCD. This tendency may result from \n\ntranslucency or water-soaking symptoms derived from disruption of cellular structures. \n\nAs discussed above, alterations in fresh-cut melon colour are mainly attributed to \n\naltered combination of low carotenoids and chlorophylls in plastids (Portela and \n\nCantwell, 1998), and not so related with water system dynamics.  \n\nFigure 5.4b demonstrates the relationship between maximum distribution T2 \n\nvalue and firmness loss/softening. As expected, T2 maximum value increases with the \n\nmelon softening (lower firmness). At day 4, maximum distribution T2 value reaches the \n\nhighest value, while softening of fresh-cut melon tissue stabilises from this day on.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n105 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5A.4 Fresh-cut melon relaxation time (T2) as function of a) total colour difference (TCD), b) firmness, and c) water activity (aw).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n106 \n\n \n\nThe softening together with cell wall degradation and loss of physical barriers, \n\npossible to observe by microscope images in Figure 5A.2, allows the leakage of \n\ncellular osmotic solutes into the apoplastic space, which then results in altered water \n\nmobility/availability (Toivonen and Brummel, 2008).  \n\nWater activity relationship with water relaxation time is presented in figure \n\n5A.4c). It is possible to observe a tendency between these two parameters, i.e., cell \n\nwater maximum distribution T2 value decreases with increasing aw. Despite of aw \n\nbeing considered as a critical parameter of food systems stability (Labuza, 1977), the \n\nusual measuring methods do not consider microstructure nor the possibility that there \n\nmay be IocaI regions differing in water content, and presumably, water availability \n\n(Hills et al., 1996a; Mathlouthi, 2001). These results demonstrate that, considering the \n\nlowest water activity values, the increase in this parameter does not reflect on water \n\nmobility. Although it is possible to observe a relationship between these two \n\nparameters, water activity measurements may not provide, for example, the \n\nrelationship of the evolution of the structural changes of the food material with the \n\nchanges of the water-macromolecules and water-water interactions that occur during \n\nfood shelf-life (Wang and Liapis, 2012), and studies have stressed that under many \n\ncommon circumstances the thermodynamics activity of water is far less relevant to \n\nprocessing and storage than structure-related properties, which can restrict the \n\nmobility and diffusion of the reactants (Anese et al., 1996; Slade and Levine, 1991).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSection B \n\nStudies on fresh-cut pear \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n109 \n\n \n\n5B.3. Results and discussion \n\n As was discussed in point 5A.3, maturity stage is an important factor that may \n\naffect the intensity of wound response in fresh-cut tissues (Beaulieu and Lea, 2007; \n\nWatada and Qi, 1999). Furthermore, the natural variability between complex biological \n\nsystems, in this case pear fruits, contribute for the differences obtained between the \n\nthree true replicates. To characterise pears maturity stage soluble solids content \n\n(SSC) was measured. The initial SSC ranged between 12.9 and 14.2 with no \n\ndifferences observed during storage time. \n\n \n\n 5B.3.1. Transverse relaxation times \n\n As happened for melon samples, fresh-cut pear transverse relaxation time (T2) \n\nwas determined with the purpose of evaluating water molecules dynamics and \n\nenvironment during fruit storage time. Figure 5B.1 shows the distribution of water \n\nproton relaxation times of fresh-cut pears during storage (data in Appendix C, Table \n\nC.1.1). It can be observed that all values of T2 from about 50 ms to very high values \n\nare presented in the fruit samples, with only one pronounced maximum of T2 value \n\nThis fact means that water, normally stored in different sub-cellular organelles in intact \n\ncells and often characterised by different proton relaxation times, attributed to \n\nvacuole, cytoplasm and cellular wall relaxation times was in our experiment free from \n\norganelles, as a consequence of pear processing (Hern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2007; \n\nHills and Remigereau, 1997; Tylewicz et al., 2011). Thus, the one maximum peak of \n\nrelaxation time detected can be attributed to the total water after the loss of cellular \n\ncompartmentation as a consequence of wounding.  \n\n Similarly with fresh-cut melon samples, after 24 hours of processing, the \n\nmaximum amplitude values of T2 shifted to lower values. Wounding, causes cell \n\ndisruption whereby enzymes and substrates sequestered in different organelles come \n\nin contact (Beaulieu and Gorny, 2001). As a consequence, a signalling-induced \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n110 \n\n \n\nwound response takes place and enzymatic, microbiological, physicochemical \n\nreactions initiate. According to the literature, as the subcellular structures are \n\ndisrupted and the release of solutes that were retained in the organelles occurs, with \n\nthe association of this solutes with water through hydrogen bounds a decrease in \n\nwater availability or an increase in \u2018water binding\u2019 can be detected (Art\u00e9s et al., 2007; \n\nChen et al., 1997). After this first day, where metabolic rate is elevated, water is \n\ncontinuously released from physical barriers in the system and the relaxation values \n\noccurred more often at values closer to free water. By day 3 of storage, T2 maximum \n\namplitude occurs for the highest T2 value and, after this day, decreases until the end \n\nof the storage period. The maximum amplitude T2 value evolving to higher T2 values \n\nwith storage time can be interpreted as the enhanced range of water relaxation time \n\ndetected and attributed to cell structure disorder due to the occurrence of membrane \n\nrupture and even plasmolise (Toivonen and Brummel, 2008). The decrease of the \n\nsignal values from water protons suggests that cells can undergo shrinkage, which \n\ncan indicate a dehydration phenomenon (Tylewicz et al., 2011). This interpretation is \n\nin agreement with the quality parameters results discussed in point 5B.3.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n111 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5B.1 Distribution of transverse water proton relaxation times (T2) in fresh-cut pear \n\nmeasured at 300 MHz and room temperature. \n\n \n\n 5B.3.2. Microstructure analysis \n\n Similarly to what was performed to fresh-cut melon, LM and SEM techniques \n\nwere used (complementary microscope images in Appendix C, Section C.2.2). \n\n LM images showed the transversal cuts of fresh-cut pear. At day 0 intercellular \n\nspaces are visible in all samples mesocarp. Spaces are round and turgid with visible \n\ncellular wall structure. As for the images obtained with SEM, figure 5B.2 shows, for \n\nday 0, closely bonded cells and defined cellular walls, reinforcing the results obtained \n\nwith light microscope (LM) and corresponding to what happen with fresh-cut melon \n\nsamples. Also, LM allows the observation of the sclereids or stone cells, with a shape \n\nof star and responsible for the gritty appearance and grainy mouthfeel of pears \n\n(Reeve, 1970). Image shows a loss of definition of these structures with storage. \n\nImages from day 4 show the sclereids spreading along the matrix. This fact may be \n\nrelated with the loss of cells natural angular morphology and integrity, together with \n\nthe loss of compactness and coherence for whole tissue, stimulated by the great \n\nnumber of cell wall disruption and could contribute to explain the T2 decrease \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n112 \n\n \n\nobtained after day 3. By this day the loss of sclereids definition may decrease the free \n\nvolume in the matrix and hence the mobility of the water proton. The phenomenon is \n\nalso seen superficially by SEM, and confirms the observations of optical microscopy. \n\n \n\nFigure 5B.2 Light and scanning electron microscope images of fresh-cut pear, at different \n\ndays of storage.

Quality parameters \n\n Figure 5B.3 shows the quality parameters: total colour difference (a), firmness \n\n(b) and water activity (c) of fresh-cut pears, along 7 days storage (results are included \n\nin Appendix C, Table C.3.2).  \n\n Figure 5B.3a shows that TCD increases drastically in the first 24 hours and \n\nafter this period remained almost constant. This colour differences increases was \n\nalready described in the literature (Gomes et al., 2010; Toivonen and Brummel, 2008). \n\nColour alterations in pears are attributed to the browning reactions in which the \n\nmechanism involves the biochemistry of the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme and \n\nits interaction with polyphenols and oxygen (Martinez and Whitaker, 1995; Toivonen \n\nand Brummel, 2008). In this specific case, the browning detected on the surfaces of \n\npear slices cannot be strictly considered a metabolic change, as it is also a \n\nbiochemical reaction of a cell-free extracts as consequence of membrane damage. \n\nPPO previously located in plastids and phenolic compounds previously sequestered in \n\nthe vacuole come in contact (Marangoni et al., 1996) then, PPO catalyses the \n\noxidation of o- diphenols into o-quinones which  polymerise forming dark melanins \n\n(Franck et al., 2007; Toivonen and Brummel, 2008). \n\n Results from firmness are shown in Figure 5B.3b. From day 1 until day 3 it is \n\nobserved a decrease in this parameter, around 10%. This is probably due to the loss \n\nof membrane integrity, cellular leakage, and the flooding of intercellular spaces \n\n(Soliva-Fortuny et al., 2002; Toivonen and Brummel, 2008). After day 3 of storage, an \n\nincrease in the firmness of fresh-cut pears was observed. Fresh-cut pears become \n\nharder in relation to day 0 (around 10 and 15% expressed as percentage of the initial \n\nvalue of firmness). Increases in firmness of fresh-cut pear have been observed when \n\npuncture methods are used (Dong et al., 2008; Gomes et al., 2010; Soliva-Fortuny et \n\nal., 2004). This increase in firmness can be caused by the partial dehydration of the \n\ncut surface and the development of abrasive surface texture, by the heterogeneous \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n114 \n\n \n\ndistribution of scleride cells in the pear tissue, or by maturation differences among \n\nindividual pieces (Lesage and Destain, 1996). The increase in firmness at day 3 of \n\nstorage coincides with the maximum water relaxation time as described in section \n\n5B.3.1. \n\n Figure 5B.3c shows that aw decrease in all pear samples during storage. \n\nLiterature reports aw as a parameter for food stability control, namely chemical \n\nreactions in foods (Labuza, 1977). As discussed in section 5B.3.1 the decrease in this \n\nparameter suggests that water is being used for the physic and biochemical \n\ndegradation reactions and/or microbial growth, occurring during the storage period. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n115 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5B.3 Fresh-pear quality parameters: a) total colour difference (TCD), b) firmness, and c) water activity (aw), during 7 days of storage.

Relaxation time versus quality parameters \n\n Figure 5B.4 shows the behaviour tendency between maximum distribution T2 \n\nvalue and pear quality parameters. The maximum distribution T2 value against TCD is \n\nshown in Figure 6.4a where it is observed a decrease in TCD with T2. As discussed in \n\nsection 5B.3.3, alterations in colour are largely a result of biochemical reactions \n\noccurring in the cell-free environment of the cell structure with water playing a vital \n\nrole for the evolution of these biochemical degradative reactions. \n\n Figure 5B.4b demonstrates the relationship between maximum distribution T2 \n\nvalue and firmness. T2 maximum value increases with pear firmness loss/softening, \n\nas expected. The cell wall degradation together with cell structure alteration/ loss (e.g. \n\nsclereids spreading along the matrix), both observed along the storage period, by \n\nmicroscope images in Figure 5B.2, allows firmness modifications with impact in free \n\nvolume and in the leakage of cellular osmotic solutes into the apoplastic space, which \n\nthen result in altered water mobility/ availability. \n\n Figure 5B.4c demonstrates the relationship between water activity and \n\nmaximum distribution T2 value. It can be seen that aw increased with water relaxation. \n\nDespite of aw be considered as a critical parameter of food systems stability (Labuza, \n\n1977) the usual measuring methods do not consider microstructure or the possibility \n\nthat there may be IocaI regions differing in water content, and presumably, of water \n\navailability (Hills et al., 1996a; Mathlouthi, 2001). \n\n Although, it was recognised a relationship between aw and water relaxation \n\ntimes, water activity may not provide the relationship of the evolution of the structural \n\nchanges of the food material with the changes of the water-macromolecules and \n\nwater-water interactions that occurring during food shelf-life (Wang and Liapis, 2012).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n117 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5B.4 Fresh-cut pear relaxation time (T2) as function of a) total colour difference (TCD), b) firmness, and c) water activity (aw). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n118 \n\n \n\n5.4. Conclusions \n\n Water proton relaxation time from fresh-cut melon and pear samples was \n\nanalysed during 7 days of storage. The distribution function for T2 presents one peak \n\ncorresponding to cells total water. The peak position (T2) decreased in the first day of \n\nstorage, indicating an increase in biochemical reactions and water-solutes bonds in \n\nthe first 24 hours after processing. \n\nRespecting to fresh-cut melon this peak position increased from day 1 to day \n\n4, remained constant until the end of storage. This indicates cellular structure \n\ndegradation, where water became free from physical barriers. For fresh-cut pear the \n\npeak position behaviour was slightly different, i.e. increased from day 1 to day 3 \n\n(showing a cellular structure degradation where water became free from physical \n\nbarriers), and decreased again until the end of storage. This decrease of the water \n\nprotons signal values, observed after day 3, suggests that cells can undergo \n\nshrinkage indicating a dehydration phenomenon, or could be associated to the cellular \n\ndisassembly of the stone cells. Both melon and pear results are supported by light \n\nand scanning electron microscope. \n\n Samples quality parameters analysed demonstrated a close relationship with \n\nthe value of T2 where the distribution function is maxima. These relationships are \n\nexplained by several phenomena such as loss of membrane integrity, cellular \n\nstructures disruption and leakage of cellular osmotic solutes into the apoplastic space; \n\nall alterations enhanced by processing-cutting. However, the relationships were \n\ndifferent for melon and pear, stressing the relevance of structure on water dynamics \n\nand food stability.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPART IV \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \n\nGeneral conclusions and future prospects\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n123 \n \n\n6.1. General conclusions \n\n  As discussed in the general introduction, the primary driving force for \n\nthe research presented in this dissertation was to contribute for a deeper \n\nunderstanding of the molecular dynamics concept on degradation reactions and \n\nstability of complex food systems. \n\n From the literature review, it was possible to identify critical issues and \n\nresearch needs on food molecular dynamics, particularly water molecular dynamics. \n\nWater is one of the most important components at a structural and development level \n\non both studied matrices: chitosan/glycerol films and fresh-cut-fruit. \n\n Chitosan/glycerol films, used as food model matrices, allowed evaluating and \n\nsystematising the plasticiser\u2019s performance. Results demonstrated the relevance of \n\nthe film forming solutions (FFS) composition. Rheological behaviour of the forming \n\nsolutions was dependent on polymer concentration. Consistency coefficient affected \n\nthe properties of the films obtained after drying, namely moisture content.. Glycerol \n\nused in FFS was responsible for films composition, by establishing the films chitosan \n\nconcentration, while the ratio polymer/plasticiser determined the films thickness and \n\nindirectly structure, i.e. plasticiser addition promoted a free volume increase. These \n\nresults were confirmed by TEM photographs. FFS glycerol addition affected the \n\ncrystalline lattice of the film, by changing the H-bonds in chitosan crystals. This fact \n\nwas reflected on the macroscopic properties of films, such as water and barrier \n\nproperties or thermomechanical.  \n\n Films molecular mobility results demonstrate two different behaviours for the \n\ntwo plasticisers analysed: water and glycerol. While glycerol was mainly bounded to \n\nthe chitosan chain network, the water present in the system was predominantly free \n\nfrom the polymeric chain. Furthermore, it was possible to infer that for lower glycerol \n\nconcentrations, free chitosan binding sites can be occupied by water molecules. This \n\nthesis also allowed to conclude that not only the water content affects the water \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n124 \n \n\nmobility, but also structural differences in the films influence the T2. Water mobility \n\nrelates to the water in the bulk and thus complements information on aw of a system.  \n\n Likewise, a relationship between plasticisers, i.e. water and glycerol, and films \n\nmacroscopic properties and microstructure were determined. For both water and \n\nglycerol, T2 decreased with the increase of glass transition temperature. The \n\ncrystallinity increased with increasing water and glycerol mobilities, showing that once \n\nthe polymeric chains are organised in the crystalline lattice, the interaction \n\npolymer/plasticiser was minimised, the free volume of the system increased and the \n\nwater and glycerol molecules were thus free to move in the matrix. The EB increased \n\nwith the water and glycerol relaxation times, while TS decreased, showing again the \n\nimpact of the polymer/polymer and polymer/plasticiser bonds effects on the system \n\nproperties.. Water vapour permeability was also correlated with the molecular mobility. \n\nThis was dependent on films thickness: in thicker films WVP increased with relaxation \n\ntime \u2013 indicating that the molecular mobility is related with the Brownian motion in the \n\nmatrix, hence the diffusion of water through the film was easier; for the thinner films \n\nno apparent correlation was found.  \n\n All these results, obtained in straightforward matrices, are useful for \n\ncharacterising and developing polymeric structures with improved functionality. \n\nFurthermore, such results can be also of great value if used as a starting point for \n\nstudies on degradation reactions and stability of more complex food systems, such as \n\nfresh-cut fruit. \n\n \n\n Fresh-cut fruit experimental work was focused on two different and well-\n\nrecognised fruits: pear and melon. Melon is one of the most important fruits in the \n\nworld fresh-cut fruit market, while pear (\u2018Rocha\u2019 pear) represents an important fruit \n\nmarket segment in Portugal. For both melon and pear, the effect of wounding was \n\nobserved through the NMR measurements, where the distribution function for T2 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n125 \n \n\npresented one peak corresponding to cells total water, after the loss of cellular \n\ncompartmentation, as a consequence of fruit processing. The increase in biochemical \n\nreactions and water solute bonds, that occur in the first 24 hours after processing as \n\nconsequence of wounding, is demonstrated by the decrease of peak position (T2), \n\nobserved in this period. This biochemical response is characteristic to most of \n\nminimally processed fruits and, as was expected, is observed for both melon and \n\npear. After this period, different water dynamics tendencies were found. These results \n\nare related with differences in fruits physiological processes and highlight the role of \n\nstructure on food stability. \n\n Quality parameters analysed demonstrated a close relationship with the value \n\nof T2 where the distribution function is maxima. These relationships are explained by \n\nseveral phenomena such as loss of membrane integrity, cellular structures disruption, \n\nor leakage of cellular osmotic solutes into the apoplastic space, which are alterations \n\nenhanced by processing-related wounding.  \n\n \n\n All these studies show the usefulness of gathering the NMR concept and \n\nmethodologies with food science, and demonstrate the great value of these studies on \n\ndegradation reactions and stability in more complex food systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \n\n \n\n \n\n126 \n \n\n6.2. Future prospects \n\n The reported research results raised new opportunities for further research: \n\n? Mathematically describe the relationship between the molecular and \n\nmacroscopic parameters in different complexity levels of food matrices. \n\n? Clarify the role of structure on systems dynamics, since it was identified as a \n\nkey factor on food matrices performance. \n\n? Understand how food preservation processes can change the dynamics of \n\nwater in the systems. For example, during freezing water suffers interesting \n\nphase changes, like crystallisation and vitrification, facts that make this \n\nprocess especially interesting for mobility studies.  \n\n? Identify the \u201cbaseline\u201d mobility for stability in high water content food products. \n\n? Apply this knowledge to food industries aiming at minimising water loss along \n\ndistribution chain and maximising incomes.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n \n\n129 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\n Aguayo, E., Escalona, V.H., Art\u00e9s, F., (2004).
