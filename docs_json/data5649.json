Real conditions regarding the ventilation and process plant operation were considered. A dispersion study of natural gas release in the module was conducted using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the state of art as far as the gas dispersion modelling is concerned. A mathematical model was built based on the numerical results and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The approach comprises into a single mathematical model the most relevant independent variables. The response surface curves calculate the flammable gas cloud volume as a function of the non-dimensional leak rate (that concerns the ventilation and the gas release rate) and the non-dimensional leak direction (which comprises the wind direction and the leak direction). The developed model had proved to be effective. It was able to predict flammable gas volume and good agreement with CFD results was observed.\nRESUMO\nEste trabalho tem como objetivo desenvolver um modelo matem\u00e1tico capaz de prever o tamanho de nuvem de g\u00e1s inflam\u00e1vel formada em uma t\u00edpica plataforma de petr\u00f3leo considerando condi\u00e7\u00f5es reais de ventila\u00e7\u00e3o e de opera\u00e7\u00e3o de uma planta de processo.

The onshore as well as offshore oil installations involve several zones with dense congestion areas and large quantities of flammable materials, which makes the activities of drilling, production and processing potentially hazardous. Large accidents involving gas explosions show the need for continuously address gas safety issues.\nOn December 2005, a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) occurred at Buncefield Oil Storage Depot, Hertfordshire, UK. Significant blast pressures were generated resulting in further loss of containment and subsequent fires in fuel storage tanks. As result of the accident, 43 people were injured and significant damage occurred to both commercial and residential properties in the vicinity. Total damages were of the order of $1.5 billion (Johnson (2010)).\nAn accident involving vapour cloud explosion also occurred in the Amuay Refinery Complex, which contains the largest oil deposit on the planet, in Venezuela. In August 2012, there was a huge explosion caused by a gas cloud coming from an area of the plant that deals with natural gas, crude oil and naphtha. Two storage tanks and other base facilities were ignited. There has been 41 casualties and other 151 injured (CBC (2012)).\nAccording to Kjellen (2007), offshore oil and gas production involves risk of accidents with a major loss-potential. In case of accidental explosion, large quantities of energy are released in a small and often confined space, causing considerable damage.\nOffshore modules also involve traditional hazards with the potential for severe occupational accidents. Operators work hard and most times in confined spaces and with difficult access\nto ransom or rescue. Das &amp; Weinberg (2012) pointed out that the impairment of escape routes in the limited deck space of offshore modules further escalates the severity/risk of VCE events. The adverse weather conditions in offshore sites, may also increase the probability of serious accidents.\nAn example of offshore accident is the explosion occurred after a gas release on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig working on the Macondo exploration well for BP in the Gulf of Mexico, in April 2010. Eleven people died as a result of the accident and others were injured (BBC (2011)).\nIn Brazil, in March 2001, the Platform P-36 sank after two explosions. The number of deaths were also 11.\nOne of the major devastating explosions offshore has occurred in July 1988, on board the offshore platform Piper Alpha, located in the North Sea. The fire began with a little explosion in the compression module in the platform and shortly escalated to a massive accidental scenario that destroyed the whole module. The disaster caused the death of 167 people (out of 226) and cost billions of dollars in property damage. From this disaster, concerns about better assessment of the risks and the future risk management were intensified, in various industrial sectors (Pate-Cornell (1993)).\nThe risk analysis of vapour cloud explosion can significantly help risk decisions. Such analysis concerns quantifying the blast overpressure generated over distance and time, which depends on the filling degree of the platform and the concentration of flammable gas cloud, among other factors. The worst case scenario is the one in which the entire environment of the platform is filled with stoichiometric mixture of gas and air, although it is far too much conservative approach. A more realistic scenario requires a gas dispersion analysis to estimate the gas cloud size.\nThere are number of methods developed over recent years to provide estimatives of flammable gas build-up in accidental release and to quantify the risk from a gas explosion. Essentially they comprise mathematical correlations and three-dimensional analysis using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD).\nThe three-dimensional analysis using CFD is the best available approach. Several studies have been developed applying different ways to analyse the gas dispersion and evaluate the flammable gas cloud size through CFD codes. Some examples of them are shown by Cormier et al. (2009), Zhang et al. (2010) and Ivings et al. (2010).\nThe main drawbacks in CFD models are the computational effort, time and costs. In risk\nanalysis, several possible gas release scenarios must be conduct to analyse the overall risk and CFD can not be employed in every single scenario within a reasonable scale of time.\nEspecially during conceptual design when important decisions are made, the explosion estimates are often sought after without performing detailed CFD analysis. The analysis need to be made quickly and on a series of concept designs until the \"optimal\" design is found. The use of detailed CFD methods in early stages, when structural design is being made, can take too much time and also be uncertain due lack of information about the geometry, so it becomes impractical for the necessity to investigate many alternatives (Huser et al. (2009)). In these initial stages, mathematical correlations can be used and the CFD analysis is applied to assess only a few critical scenarios in detail at a later stage.\nThe application of mathematical models to estimate the flammable gas cloud size in offshore installations was introduced by Cleaver et al. (1999), who developed a set of correlations based on benchmarking data in an offshore module.\nBased on the correlations developed by Cleaver et al. (1999), Huser &amp; Kvernvold (2000) proposed the application of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to predict the gas cloud size. This method allows to access the flammable volume through two response surfaces, providing breakthroughs in analysis of the flammable gas clouds.\nHowever, there seems to be room for improvement as the utilisation of two equations place too much a burden on the engineer who is conducting the analysis. It is not always easy to set up the curves as it is not straightforward to adjust the independent parameters in the curve as well as to migrate from one expression to another mathematical expression. The development of a simpler mathematical model is necessary.\nThis work proposes a single correlation to predict the flammable gas cloud size in an offshore module. The approach couples into a single mathematical model the most relevant independent variables.\n1.1\tGeneral goal\nThe current work is focused on the development of a mathematical model to estimate the flammable gas cloud size in a offshore module applying the response surface methodology. The\nanalysis of the gas dispersion were conducted based on CFD simulations of natural gas releases in an offshore platform. The numerical results from the dispersion simulations were used as input and benchmarking during the development of the model.\n1.2\tSpecific goals\nThe specific goals of this work are:\n\u2022\tCreate a geometry based on a real offshore module;\n\u2022\tAnalyse the parameters that influence the gas dispersion and identify the most relevant for this study;\n\u2022\tProvide the correct modelling of the transport phenomena (momentum, mass and heat transfer) using the ANSYS CFX 12.0 CFD software;\n\u2022\tDefine a design of experiments for the dispersion simulations;\n\u2022\tPerform the dispersion simulations and develop the response surface;\n\u2022\tCompare the values of flammable volume predicted by the developed response surface model with the results provided by dispersion simulations in CFD.\n1.3\tThis dissertation\nFor better understanding of this study, the dissertation structure is summarised below.\nIn Chapter 1 a brief introduction was presented concerning the gas explosion risks associated with the oil industry activities and the necessity of applying a combination of operational measures in design to prevent and mitigate accidents. It was also shown the motivations and the aim of this study.\nChapter 2 covers the first part of the literature review, which includes the main phenomena associated with gas dispersion and the factors that influence the flammable cloud size. The empirical models as well as the CFD models used for these studies are also discussed.\nChapter 3 presents the mathematical equations that must be solved to describe a fluid flow and the models that are used in the dispersion study. The steps applied in CFD analysis is also shown.\nIn Chapter 4 the Response Surface Methodology is introduced.

The comparison between the results provided by the model and the CFD simulations is shown. Conclusions and future work are presented in Chapter 8.\n6\nChapter 2\nThe Flammable Gas Cloud\nAnalysis of possible accident scenarios or investigation of accidents usually begins calculating the mass of flammable material released. The next step is to calculate the air entrainment rates and how the material will be dispersed. With these information it is possible to find the fraction of the released mass that may be in the flammable region. Often this is a small fraction of the total amount released. Only the flammable mass within or near the flammable limits participates in a explosion or fire (AICHE (2000)).\nThe flammable gas cloud is defined by the volume occupied by the gaseous mixture of air and a flammable gas within the flammable limit.\nThe flammable limits, also called explosive limits, refer to the highest and lowest concentration of a flammable material in a mixture with air which is likely to ignite. These limits are determined experimentally and they are usually expressed by the volumetric concentration. The abbreviation LFL and UFL are used to refer the lower flammable limit and the upper flammable limit, respectively. Below the LFL, gaseous mixtures are \"too lean\" to burn, while concentrations higher than UFL are \"too rich\" to burn.\n2.1\tGas dispersion phenomenon\nThe dispersion comprises the diffusion of a material into another in a certain region or volume. The studies of dispersion started with the dispersion of pollutants from industrial chimney\nstacks and extended for hazardous releases from process plant (Lees (2005)).\nDispersion models are used to explain how the materials will be diffused. They are relevant to describe the release of flammable material, mixing of the material with air and the formation of a flammable gas cloud. Such models can identify the affected area and the material concentration in each region.\nFor gas dispersion, the models describe the transport of gaseous materials by air. In these cases the most important physical parameters that influence the material atmospheric dispersion and must be considered are (Lees (2005)):\n\u2022\tMeteorology;\n\u2022\tTopography;\n\u2022\tElevation of the leak;\n\u2022\tGas Density;\n\u2022\tRelease Momentum.\nThe meteorological conditions that affect the dispersion are the wind features and the atmospheric stability condition. The atmosphere stability determines the degree of mixing. During the day the air temperature varies greatly with height (unstable condition) and the mixture air-gas by diffusion is intense. At night the temperature gradient is smaller (stable condition) and the dispersion is not as strong.\nWind characteristics influence not only the gas dispersion, but directly affect the flammable gas cloud size and will be analysed in next sections. The same will be done to the gas density, that is also an important parameter.\nThe topography affects the wind profile and the mixture near the surface. Each surface is assigned a roughness and a specific wind speed profile develops. The mixture of the material and air can be raised by the presence of obstacles in the surface.\nThe leak elevation influences the concentration of the dispersing material at ground level. Most hazardous releases are treated at this level and therefore, the concentration of the material is great near the ground.\nIn a gas leak, the dispersion of the material is determined by its momentum and buoyancy. If momentum forces predominate, the fluid forms a jet, while if buoyancy forces predominate, it forms a plume. Both types of emission are sometimes described as plumes, the jet being a forced plume (AICHE (2000)).\nThe flammable gas release normally occurs from facilities at high pressure and its behaviour is a jet. After the release, a gas cloud is carried by the wind in a form of plume.\n2.2\tDispersion models\nIn section 2.1 it was shown how the gas dispersion occurs and the main factors that affect it. It was also mentioned the importance of using the dispersion models to represent correctly this phenomena. This section presents some of this models.\n2.2.1\tJet model\nAs previously discussed, if the momentum of the material released from an orifice is high, the dispersion in the initial phase at least is due to the momentum, and the emission is described as a momentum jet.\nRecirculation regions are formed near the jet creating wide air penetration. According to Wilkening et al. (2008), this is the main mechanism of mixing between air and gas released.\nThe behaviour of a circular (or conical) turbulent jet has been widely studied. It can be described by empirical features as following (Lees (2005)):\n\u2022\tThe jet is conical and apparently diverges from a virtual point source upstream of the orifice;\n\u2022\tThe dilution occurs by turbulent mixing;\n\u2022\tThe time-mean velocity and concentration profiles are similar after 10 diameters and are approximately Gaussian;\n\u2022\tThe concentration profile is wider than the velocity profile;\n\u2022 The jet entrains air, but conserves its momentum, so that the momentum flux at any plane normal to the axis is constant.\nPope (2000) expressed some jet characteristics in a schematic way (Figure 2.1) and developed a relationship to represent the jet behaviour.\nFigure 2.1: Schematic description of a turbulent jet (Pope (2000)).\nplane of orifice\n\u00a1a\ni;\n_5t/\n* 2\nu(x, r)\n^max\nJ L\nentrainment y of ambient fluid\nWhere:\nx is the axial distance;\nd is the diameter of orifice;\nu(x, r) is the velocity at distance x and in the radius r;\numax is the maximum velocity in the centreline of the jet.\nLees (2005) mentions different models to describe the dispersion by a turbulent jet including underexpanded, obstructed and sonic jets. The most applied models in engineering and others studies are based on axisymmetric jets.\nThe behaviour of an axisymmetric jet is well known and easy to be modelled, which makes it normally used as simplification in modelling situations. Some axisymmetric jet features are presented below (Mih (1989)):\n\u2022 The potential core length is approximately equal to 6.9D, from the jet exit (D is the diameter of orifice);\n\u2022\tThe centreline velocity decay is well established and proportional to 1/x, where x is the dimensionless distance from the orifice;\n\u2022\tThe spreading angle from the centreline is 10 - 15\u00b0.\nOn the other hand, Wakes (2003), who had studied modelling aspects of the jet to describe the behaviour and its dispersion in offshore structure, observed that using axisymmetric jets to simulate leaks is not recommended for safety analysis. For the author, a real jet behaves as a high aspect ratio jet, that is very different of an axisymmetric one.\nIn her experimental work, Wakes (2002), found very different behaviours of the flow for jets starting from orifice with different gasket shapes, which indicate that the gasket shape is an important factor in the behaviour of the jet. It was also identified that the range of the jets spreading angles for the geometries studied, in many cases, do not correspond to that for an axisymmetric jet. The velocity profile of the axisymmetric jets was found only for certain geometries.\nFurthermore, it was observed that using axisymmetric jets to simulate leaks may under predict the leaked gas concentration levels and the growth rate of the air-gas mixture and also to underestimate the gas cloud size.\nHence, Wakes (2003) argues that the utilisation of axisymmetric jets to simulate leaks should be addressed with care.\n2.2.1.1\tHigh aspect ratio jet behaviour\nIn process area the leaks are most likely to emanate from a fraying or flaws in pipeline structures, as a valve or flange. Such leaks are developed from a non-circular orifice shape and could get a high aspect ratio cross-sectional jet behaviour.\nThe term high aspect ratio was introduced first in aerodynamics to indicate the ratio of wing length and breadth. A high aspect ratio indicates long and narrow wings, whereas a low aspect ratio indicates short and stubby wings (Kermode (1972)).\nIn jet studies the term is used to indicate the jet shape and comprises the relation between the two cross-section dimensions in a three-dimensional jet (where the flow properties vary in all directions). Taking a example a rectangular cross-sectional jet (Figure 2.2), a high aspect ratio cross-sectional jet will have a large ratio between the length x and the width y.\nFigure 2.2: Rectangular cross-sectional three-dimensional jet.\nThe studies concerning high aspect ratio cross-sectional jets indicate that they behave in a different way to those with axisymmetric cross-sections.\nWakes (2002) has mentioned the main features a high aspect cross-sectional jet behaviour (Figure 2.3):\n\u2022\tin its early stages the jet is expected to have a potential core region that will be of a decreasing length as the aspect ratio increases. This behaviour is independent of the Reynolds number;\n\u2022\tThe second region is a characteristic decay region;\n\u2022\tIt exists an axisymmetric decay region in the far field.\nDeca^\nFigure 2.3: Schematic of the flow field of a rectangular jet showing the different decay zones (Wakes (2002)).\n2.2.1.2\tOthers forms to model jets\nAnother forms to represent the jet behaviour has been developed by Benintendi (2010). The author developed analytical method to modelling a turbulent jet flow and sizing the gas volumes resulting from them, to be used in hazardous areas classification.\nSo, Benintendi (2010) has considered a typical jet with a circular orifice exit and identified the regions of it (Figure 2.4 shows a schematic division of the jet flow in regions). Each jet zone was analysed carefully considering the velocity profile, gas concentration and entrainment with air.\nFigure 2.4: Jet flow with different zones (Benintendi (2010)).\nBenintendi (2010) obtained a jet calculation procedure which enables a simple and reliable sizing of mixture air-gas volume. It can be adopted for hazardous area classification, improving the reliability of the results and at avoiding the oversizing of the classified zones.\nA similar model were also developed by Benintendi (2011) considering the laminar regime and take into account the effect of density and viscosity differences between air and flammable gas.\n2.2.2\tPlume and puff model\nThe plume model describes a continuous release of material. In most cases, this model deals with an initial jet in which the momentum decays so that the emission undergoes transition to a buoyant plume (Wilkening et al. (2008)). Figure 2.5 shows a typical plume.\nLees (2005) mentioned some principal characteristics of a plume. Under turbulent conditions the plume is conical and apparently diverges from an equivalent point source, the position of the point source depending on the point of transition from laminar to turbulent flow. The time-mean velocity and time-concentration profiles are similar and are approximately Gaussian.\nContinuous Release Source\nFigure 2.5: Plume formed by a continuous release (AICHE (2000)).\nPuff model, or neutral and positively buoyant plume, describes the material concentration profile as time function from a single release with a fixed quantity of the material. An example would be a sudden leak due to rupture of a stag storage, giving a large vapour cloud that moves away from the breaking point.Figure 2.6 shows a puff formed by a instantaneous release.\nWind Direction\nThe concentration are same in the three surfaces\nWhile the Plume refers to continuous emissions, puff considers emissions that are short in duration compared with the travel time (time for cloud to reach location of interest).\nA plume can be described as a continuous leak puffs so the puff model can be used to describes it. For studies involving a dynamic plume, the puff model should be used. However, if the information of a plume in a state stationary is enough, the plume model is recommended because it is easier to apply.\n2.2.3\tCFD models\nThe fluid dynamic models are represented by differential equations. For each particular problem, these equations are subjected to specific boundary and initial conditions, which will characterize the fluid flow.\nFor problems with simple geometry, fluid flow and boundary conditions, the solution of these equations can be straightforward. However, almost all real problems have no analytical solution and a numerical approach is necessary. The numerical solution of the equations of continuity, momentum and energy can be obtained through Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD).\nCFD is defined as the set of methodologies that enable the computer to provide us with a numerical simulation of fluid flows (Hirsch (2007)). CFD has been widely applied in many fields and its utilisation is limited by the available models to describe all phenomena involved in every type of fluid flow and also by the computational resources.\nThe main strategy of CFD is to replace a continuous computational domain by a discrete domain, using a grid. In the discrete domain, each variable of flow is defined just in the grid points. The values of the variables in another locations are estimated by interpolation of the grid points.\nThe CFD solutions contain a great amount of information about the flow field (pressure, velocity, specific mass, etc...) which enables the comprehension of its behaviour. However, the results must be analysed with care. Some errors can be generated during the numerical solution and the model will have low representation compared with the real problem (Maliska (2004)).\n2.3\tVariables that influence the flammable gas cloud size\nThe phenomena that are involved on generation of flammable gas cloud has been studied by Cleaver et al. (1994). It was shown how each one of these phenomena can be modelled to predict accumulation of natural gas in a characteristic volume (an offshore module, for example).\nCleaver et al. (1994) investigated the dispersion of high pressure natural gas releases in a congested and partially confined volume. It was noted that the ventilation rate and the behaviour of gas release are the main factors that influence the generation of flammable gas cloud.\n2.3.1\tVentilation rate\nThe ventilation rate corresponds to the total air flow within a region under study. It depends mainly on the wind features (speed and direction) and the geometry of the region.\nBesides being used as input to find the cloud sizes the ventilation can also be used to decide which leak rate to simulate in order to find the largest flammable cloud (Qiao (2010)).\n2.3.1.1\tWind speed and direction\nThe wind speed is important for the mixture between air and fuel, yielding a flammable cloud. As the wind speed increases, the gas is carried downwind faster, but the material is also diluted faster by a larger quantity of air, which can lead to a large flammable cloud.\nThe analysis of the influence of wind direction is related to the geometry of the module. The presence of a large structure in the module, depending on the wind direction, will cause great restriction to the air flow through the module. As consequence, if a gas cloud is formed, it will be impeded to disperse and will accumulate in a certain part of the module.\n2.3.1.2\tGeometry of the module\nThe air flow inside a module is often controlled by the presence of large structures into or near it. They will create large recirculation zones and set up the major patterns flow (Qiao (2010)). It is important to model such structure elements correctly.\n2.3.2\tThe gas release\nThe release behaviour is one of the most important factor in dispersion analysis, being determined by interaction of the momentum and buoyancy driven motions (HSE (1992)). However, others factors about the release may also affect the gas dispersion and the generation of the flammable cloud and must be considered.\n2.3.2.1\tGas density\nThe buoyancy represents the effective gravity force and depends on the relation between the gas and air density (Kundu (2002)). Thus the density can be considered the main property of the gas that influence the buoyancy forces and the mixture air-gas.\nIn practice, a gas lightweight will rise faster after leak and can be diluted by ventilation giving a great flammable gas cloud. On the other hand, a air-dense gas mixture will take place more slowly and the region of flammable gas could be smaller (Qiao (2010)).\nThe leak conditions, as pressure and temperature, that affect the gas density are also important.\n2.3.2.2\tLeak rate and direction\nThe leak rate directly influences the release momentum motion and, consequently, its behaviour. The interaction of the leak rate with the ventilation flow is also important to form the flammable gas cloud and must be analysed.\nIn general, a small release of gas can be easy diluted by ventilation and disperse while, a large release is harder to disperse. However the intensity of dispersion depends also on ventilation rate. For example, both configurations: small release with small ventilation rate and large release with high ventilation rate may originate a great flammable cloud. In contrast, a small release with a high ventilation rate and a large release with a small ventilation rate may yield a small region of flammable cloud (Cleaver et al. (1994)).\nThe relationship between leak and wind direction must be considered too. The mixture process of air-gas can be more effective when the leak is in the opposite direction to the wind, giving large flammable gas clouds.\n2.3.2.3\tLeak location\nThe analysis of the leak location is related with the gas density. For a module with different elevations, for example, the leak at low elevation with dense gas creates a gas cloud that is too rich to ignite at the lower part of the module. While, the higher the leak elevation, the easier the gas\ngets diluted and, consequently, creates a large flammable cloud (Qiao (2010)).\n2.4\tEstimating the flammable gas cloud size\nLees (2005) presents analytical models developed by different authors to estimate the mass of gas within the flammable range in a cloud from a flammable gas release. They take into account the gas properties and the release behaviour. The wind behaviour is computed with the release behaviour and the effect of the geometry or process plant are neglected.\nEpstein &amp; Fauske (2007) have developed analytical expressions to predict the flammable fuel mass, the total flammable mass (fuel + entrained air) and the volume of the flammable region within a buoyant fuel-jet release. Such expressions are based on basic dimensionless parameters as Froude Number and include the effects of release momentum, buoyancy and orifice geometry. The analytical expressions could predict average fuel concentrations in the flammable regions of the clouds, which serve as indicators of the severity in case of vapour cloud explosions.\nLike other analytical methods, the approaches discussed above consider mainly the release behaviour, but for risk analysis a more complete study is necessary.\nCleaver et al. (1999) have developed simple correlations to predict the flammable gas cloud size for a range of a gas releases scenarios. Experimental work was carried out using an offshore module with three different configurations of confinement. A high pressure natural gas releases was defined from three different release locations with five orientations at each one. The behaviour of both release and ventilation were analysed. Measurements were made of the gas release rate and exit conditions, the external wind speed and direction, the atmospheric conditions, the gas concentration and flow velocities within the module.\nBased on the experimental results, Cleaver et al. (1999) mustered the parameters that affect the volume of gas-air mixture (within a flammable limits) on dimensionless groups, giving the following correlations:\n(2.1)\nL = V1/3\n(2.2)\nwhere:\nL is the length scale for the module;\nR is the dimensionless release parameter;\nV\tis the volume of the module;\nm is the mass flow rate of gas released;\nps is the density of the gas at the release condition; and\nUv is the average ventilation velocity within the module.\nIt was observed that the release parameter (R) is related to the filling degree of the module by flammable mixture. Besides, for small releases the flammable volume is independent of the length scale of the module.\nStarting from these conclusions, a simple correlation was developed to express the flammable gas cloud size dependence form:\nV\t* R3/2\t(2.3)\nL3\nRecently, Das &amp; Weinberg (2012) have developed a methodology to improve the estimation of flammable mass for vapour cloud explosion modelling in offshore quantitative risk assessment. The method is based on a traditional ignition probability model known as UKOOA model.\nAccording to the authors, the UKOOA model is based on a four-area approach using the area of each as a basis for assigning an ignition probability. A volume of flammable vapour is calculated in each of the four regions and is given as input of the probability model.\nDas &amp; Weinberg (2012) have modified the UKOOA model by accounting the effect of mitigation measures on release rate and adding a directional probability for wind. The platform geometry, congestion factors, offshore conditions, release direction and location and wind direction were also considered. Analytical correlations were developed for gas release and its dispersion. The results provided by these correlations were compared with CFD simulations giving good approximation. When it was compared with the conventional method, the new method provided better estimates of flammable mass.\nThe correlations developed by Das &amp; Weinberg (2012) are more complex than that ones presented by Cleaver et al. (1999). They require more knowledge about the geometry of the module under study and the offshore conditions where it is installed. On the other hand, the Cleaver et al. (1999)'s correlations are easier to apply and can provide good estimations about the flammable cloud size, even when little is known about the geometry.\nChapter 3\nMathematical Modelling and CFD\nIn CFD, to solve any physical problem, the first step is to know well the phenomena and the system under study. It will permit to construct a mathematical model correctly and choose the best numerical tool. In the mathematical model it is important to include the identification of the system variables and their applications as well as the conditions of the study.\nOnce the problem is modelled, it is necessary to make use of some software with a CFD code. The CFD codes generally present four main elements: a geometry generator, a pre-processor (mesh and set up), a solver and a post-processor.\n3.1\tMathematical modelling\nIn Fluid Mechanics the equations that govern the flow are obtained applying the principle of conservation to the following quantities:\n\u2022\tMass;\n\u2022\tMomentum;\n\u2022\tEnergy;\nThe application of each equation depends on the characteristic of problem. In some cases it is not necessary to solve all these equations while in other circumstances the utilisation of additional\nmodel is required.\n3.1.1 The mass conservation\nZ + V- (p u) = 0 dt\n(3.1)\nThe first term in left hand side represents the rate of change of fluid density with time. For flows in steady state this term is equal to zero.\nThe second term is the divergence term. It indicates the rate of change of the specific mass with respect to the spacial coordinates.\nA fluid is usually called incompressible if its density does not change with pressure. In this case, and for steady state, the continuity equation becomes (equation 3.2):\nV-u = 0\n(3.2)\n3.1.2 The momentum equation\nThe momentum equation, expressed in equation 3.3, originates from the application of Newton\u2019s second law of motion to an element of fluid. It includes the principle of angular moment and represents the variation of momentum as function of resultant forces acting on the fluid.\nd\n\u2014 (p u) + u \u2022 (Vp u) = pg -VP + [Vt] dt\n(3.3)\nThe equation 3.3 can be applied to all directions of fluid flow. The group of equation is so called Navier-Stokes Equations.\nThe first term in the left represents the rate of increase of momentum while the second take into account the rate of momentum addition by convection and molecular transport.\nThe terms in the right represent the body force and pressure gradient, respectively. The last term in equation 3.3 is a second order tensor that computes the viscous effects.\nSimilarly to Continuity Equation, the equation of motion can be simplified according some flow features:\n\u2022 The Navier-Stokes Equations to a Newtonian fluid and incompressible flow can be written as:\nd\t2\n\u2014(p u) + u \u2022 (Vp u) = pg -VP + pV2 u dt\n\u2022 For inviscid flow, the viscous effects could be negligible (p = 0):\nd\n\u2014(p u) + u \u2022 (Vp u) = pg -VP dt\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\nThe equation 3.5 is the most common simplified form of Navier-Stokes Equations and it is known as Euler Equation.\n3.1.3\tThe energy equation\nThe energy equation contains a large number of influences. For pure Newtonian fluids with p, Cp, k and p physical constants, the most general form is presented below (equation 3.6):\n. D\n(P Cp)Dt T = V \u2022 (kT VT) + P^v + Sh\n(3.6)\nHere, Cp is heat capacity at constant pressure (the circumflex over the symbol indicates a quantity per unity of mass), kT is the thermal conductivity,&lt;pv is the dissipation function and the term Sh indicates the volumetric rate of heat generation. The dissipation function is usually negligible, except in systems with large velocity gradients (Bird (2002)).\nThe substantial derivative term can be written as D = d + u V so that the equation 3.6\nbecomes:\nd\n\u2014 (p Cp T) + V \u2022 (p uCpT) = V \u2022 (kT VT) + p + Sh dt\n(3.7)\n3.2\tTurbulence\nThe great majority of fluid flows encountered in daily life and with practical engineering applications are turbulent.\nTurbulence can be defined as an irregular motion of fluid flow in which the various quantities show a random variation with time and space coordinates, so that statistically distinct average values can be discerned (Wilcox (1994)).\nKundu (2002) mention some characteristics of turbulent flows:\n\u2022\tIrregularity - The flow is irregular, random and chaotic and consists a spectrum of different scales (eddy sizes). The largest eddies are the order of the flow geometry and the smallest eddies are given by viscous forces .\n\u2022\tLarge Reynolds Number - Turbulence occurs at high values of Reynolds number, when inertial forces become more important than the viscous forces.\n\u2022\tEffective transport - In turbulent flows, the fluid particles are fast mixed while they are moving through the flow. As consequence, the transport and fluid mixture is much more effective compared with laminar flow.\n\u2022\tThree dimensional - Turbulent flow is always three-dimensional. The motion of fluid particles occurs due to fluctuations in position and time in a three dimensional velocity field.\n\u2022\tDissipation - Turbulent flow is dissipative, which means that kinetic energy in smallest eddies are transformed in internal energy. The kinetic energy is transferred through different sizes of eddies from the largest to the smallest. The process of energy transfer is called energy cascade process.\n\u2022\tContinuum - The turbulent flow can be treat as continuum, even though the smallest turbulent scales in the flow are larger than the molecular scale.\nAt first, the Navier-Stokes equations describe both laminar and turbulent flows without the need of additional information. However, modelling turbulent flows span a large range of turbulent length and time scales and would generally involve length scales much smaller than the smallest\nfinite volume mesh used in numerical analysis (ANSYS CFX (2011)). The numerical solution of all scales is impractical when considering the current computational resources.\nTo compute turbulence and explore the greatest possible amount of its effects in the fluid flow some turbulence models have been developed.\n3.2.1\tTurbulence models\nThe available methods to solve the turbulence and calculate the quantities of interest are classified into two main groups.\nIn first group we can find the models capable to completely solve mathematically the transport equations and, consequently, the turbulence. The main method used in these models are the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS).\nIn DNS, the equations are directly solved for all length and time scales of fluid flow. This method can capture all relevant phenomena without approximation or simplification, including the smallest scales. DNS can be considered the best way to solve the turbulence, but because all length-scales and time-scales are solved, DNS is computationally expensive. As the computational cost increases with Reynolds number (^ Re3), DNS is restricted to flows with low to moderate Re (Hirsch (2007)).\nOther turbulence models as Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are not able to capture all phenomena that involve the fluid flow. They are used to solve the transport equations for a mean velocity flow field and require less computational effort than DNS.\nIn RANS models all turbulent effects are modelled and the quantities are calculated based on their average values. Because RANS simulations do not directly solve the transport equations and turbulence scale, it is expected to be less accurate and reliable than LES and DNS. However, it has been presented good performance for many engineering studies with low computational costs. RANS methods are the most widely used approach in CFD simulations of industrial flows.\nThe Large Eddy Simulation is a method that partly solve the transport equations. Andrey Kolmogorov has defined the small length scale as the ones that could exist in a fluid flow without energy dissipation (Kolmogorov scale). In LES the equations are directly solved (as in DNS) for\nlarge turbulent eddies, with length down to the Kolmogorov scale. The effects in smallest eddies are modelled using a sub-grid model. It is enough to capture most part of the turbulence effect with good accuracy.\nBecause it does not solve small scales, LES requires less computational effort than DNS but , when compared with RANS, LES is more computationally expensive. The LES models can be applied in situations where DNS is inapplicable, but its utilization is limited to moderate values of Reynolds number.\n3.2.1.1\tRANS models\nIn turbulent flows the properties exhibit aleatory fluctuations that must be considered. The Reynolds Stresses theory uses the concept of mean flow to solve turbulent problems (Pope (2000)). According to this theory the values of the properties are expressed as the sum of the average values and their respective fluctuations:\nO = 0 + 0'\t(3.8)\nwhere 0 is the value of the variable in a specific time, 0 is its average time and 0' is the turbulent fluctuation in a instant.\nFigure 3.1 shows a example of an instantaneous velocity and its fluctuations around the mean velocity in a turbulent flow.\nU(t)\nU (average)\nTime (t)\nFigure 3.1: Fluctuations in a turbulent flow.\nIn RANS, the Navier-Stokes equations are modified by introducing average terms to represent the mean value of the variables in fluid flow. Such procedure introduces additional unknown terms, called \"Turbulent\" or \"Reynolds\" Stresses, that must be calculated in order to achieve the solution of the problem. The equations used to close the system define the turbulence model (ANSYS CFX (2011)).\nThe RANS models can be divided into two main classes: the eddy viscosity models and Reynolds stresses models.\nEddy viscosity models consider that turbulence consists a small eddies which are continuously forming and dissipating. They also assume that Reynolds stresses are proportional to mean velocity gradients. The main turbulence models in this category are:\n\u2022\tZero-Equation or algebraic model;\n\u2022\tOne-Equation model;\n\u2022\tTwo-Equation models: k-s, RNG k-s and k-w.\nIn Reynolds stresses turbulent models, all components of Reynolds stress tensor and the dissipation rate are presented in transport equations. Such equations are solved for the individual stress components. Here, the most common models are:\n\u2022\tStandard Reynolds Stress model: SSG and LLR;\n\u2022\tOmega-Based Reynolds Stress model.\nThe correct choice of the most appropriate turbulence model is crucial to a successful modelling and CFD simulation of a real problem as the dispersion of toxic and/or flammable substances.\n3.2.1.2\tThe k-s model\nThe k-s model is considered the industry standard model and has proven to be stable and numerically robust. For general purpose simulations this model offers a good compromise in terms of accuracy and robustness (ANSYS CFX (2011)).\nCormier et al. (2009) have studied the key parameters that influence the application of computational fluid dynamics for LNG (liquefied natural gas) vapour dispersion modelling. Tests were performed to provide real data and three turbulence models were compared to modelling LNG release using CFD. They concluded, in concordance with other authors, that the SSG-RSM model provides the best fit, while the k-s and RNG k-s models were slightly less apt. However, the k-s model requires lesser computational time, which makes it the most used model for gas dispersion simulation.\nIn k-s model, k is the turbulent kinetic energy and s is the turbulence dissipation rate. The values of k and s can be directly obtained from differential transport equations as follows: d(p k) + Vp u k = V^(p + p jvkj + (Pk - ps) + Pkb\t(3.9)\nd(ps) + Vpus = V(p + jvsj + s(C1\u00a3Pk - C2sps + C1\u00a3Psb)\t(3.10)\nwhere C1s, C2s,&lt;rk and ak are constants (see Table 3.1). Pkb and Psb represent the influence of buoyancy forces and Pk is the turbulence production due to viscous forces.\nIn equations 3.9 and 3.10 above, pt is the turbulent viscosity. The k-s model assumes that this term is linked to the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation by the following relation:\nk2\npt \u2014 Cpp\ne\n(3.11)\nHere, Cp is a constant of the model also given in Table 3.1.\nTable 3.1: Constant values for the standard k-s turbulence model (ANSYS CFX (2011)).\nConstant\tValue\nCp\t0.09\nC1s\t1.44\nC2s\t1.92\n<Te\t1\n&amp;k\t1.3\nChapter 4\nResponse Surface Methodology\nThe response surface methodology (RSM) comprises a collection of statistical and deterministic techniques that are used to model and to analyse problems wherein one or more response variables are affected by many independent (or controlled) variables and the relationship between both is unknown. The main idea of this method is to explore the influence of each independent variable on the response and find its optimal value over a certain region of interest (Hill &amp; Hunter (2002)).\n4.1\tThe basic ideas about Response Surface Methodology\nAccording to RSM, a response variable, y, can be describe as a function of the most important control (or independent) variables (x1, x2,..., xk) and the relationship between these variables can be approximated by a polynomial model:\ny = f'(x)fi + e\t(4.1)\nf is a vector function of p elements that consists of powers and cross-products of powers of x1,x2,...,xk up to a certain degree, 3 is a vector of p unknown constant coefficients refereed to as parameters and e is a random experimental error assumed to have a zero mean.\nThe Response Surface Methodology consists of two main steps: design of experiments and the statistical modelling.\n4.1.1\tDesign of experiments\nIn design of experiment, a reasonable number of tests are carried out in order to collect data to statistical analysis. Such tests consist of making changes on the input variables to identify the modifications in the output response. In each case, one specific response y is observed and it is correlated with a particular configuration of independent variables.\nMathematically, each experiment can be represented by a point with coordinates Xj = (x1 j, x2j,..., xnj) in a n-dimensional space and a value of y is observed.\nIn the design of experiments the independent variables involved in the process under study are called factors and the values that they can assumed are the levels. The experiments involve different combinations among the levels of two or more factors (Rodrigues &amp; Iemma (2005)).\nThe factorial design is represented by the notation Nk, where k represents the number of factors and N the levels. Through this relation, it is possible to obtain the number of experiments that must be performed.\nIt is most common and easier to analyse the variables into two or three levels.\n4.1.2\tStatistical modelling\nIn this stage, the data obtained in experiments are interpolated giving a response surface. The polynomial model is also chosen in order to describe such surface and to predict the correlation between variables with good accuracy. The selection of the model depends on the aim of the study.\nAccording to Box &amp; Draper (1987), in most cases, a first-order (linear) or a second order (quadratic) polynomial model is used:\nk y = Pa + ^2 fiixi + 6\t(4.2)\ni=1\nkk\ny = /P, + ^PiXi +\tPijXiXj + y piX + 6\t(4.3)\ni=1\ti^j\ti=1\nThe first-degree model is commonly used at the preliminary stage of the investigation or when the interest of the study is to approximate the response surface over a relatively small\nregion of independent variables. Such model can be described just in terms of the main variables or considering the interaction among these variables. In the first case, the response is a flat surface and when the interaction is considered, one curvature is introduced into the response function. However, in many cases the true response surface curvature is strong and the first-order model is inadequate (even with the interaction term included). In these situations, a second-order model is required.\nThe second-order model is the most common in response surface methodology. Many experimental studies use second-order models to solve real response surface problems with good approximation. The main reason for its great applicability is the flexibility of this model, which allows different functional forms.\nAn important consideration concerning the selection of the polynomial model is the computation costs. After to a certain degree, the increase rate in the polynomial accuracy reduces, while computational cost increases exponentially. Furthermore, higher order polynomials can exhibit misbehaviour in the sub-domains that are not covered by the experiments.\n4.2\tThe RSM applications\nThe RSM was first used by Box and Wilson in 1951 (Box &amp; Wilson (1951)). They identified this technique as a cheap and easy tool to predict response values for particular configuration of the control variables with good level of reliability, even though little is known about the process. Thereafter, the RSM has been applied in many fields, especially as an optimization tool.\nResponse surface methodology has been proposed, for example, as a tool for rapidly optimizing the activation parameters in order to obtain the highest possible CO2 capture capacity of activated carbons. The optimum values of activation temperature and burn-off degree that maximize CO2 uptake by the activated carbons (at 35 \u00b0C and atmospheric pressure) were obtained within the experimental region (Gil et al. (2013)).\nAnother application using the RSM is optimization of reaction conditions of cardanolbased epoxidised novolac resin (CNE) production proposed by Minakshi et al. (2011). It was possible to establish a relationship between the process variables and the extent of conversion\nunder a wide range of operating conditions which resulted in different extent of conversions. The predicted values obtained by the model were close to the experimental values indicating suitability of the model.\nMathematical models can also be developed using numerical data (experiments). Zhao et al. (2007) have performed numerical simulations of a demister vane with various geometries and operating conditions to study its separation efficiency. The prediction model was obtained based on RSM capable to estimate the effects of different geometries and operation conditions on the separation efficiency, and that could direct the optimum design of demisters. The predictive results were compared with some experimental and numerical data and it was found good agreement between them.\nIn process engineering, the response surface methodology has several applications improving and optimizing processes. Rastegar et al. (2012), for example, have used RSM to improve the performance of a bioreactor for treatment of petroleum refinery effluent. The bioreactor was used for waste-water treatment and simultaneous biogas production. It was possible to find models to reduce the effluent chemical oxygen demand and biogas production based on three critical factors giving better results than before optimization.\nJaliliannosrati et al. (2013) have used the response surface methodology to analyse the biodiesel production by two-step reactive extraction using a microwave system. It was investigated the influence of process variables (partCicles seed size, time of irradiation, agitation speed and catalyst loading) on conversion of triglyceride (TGs). The highest biodiesel yield (90.01 %) and conversion (97.29 %) were achieved at the optimum condition and the RSM could accurately predict the experimental results (regression coefficient \u00ab 0.977).\nThe RSM has also been used in process control to ensure its safety and efficiency. Coetzer et al. (2008) have studied a fixed bed dry bottom gasification process. The response surface method was employed to construct a model for the pure gas yield and to calculate its propagating variance through the model due to the variability in the hard-to-control variables (coal particle size distribution and coal composition). It was presented an effective method for determining the optimum values for these variables which maximize the pure gas yield and simultaneously minimize its variance.\nThe examples above show that the response surface methodology has been widely applied to optimize process. On the other hand, few applications of RSM to process safety have been\nconsidered.\nOyewole &amp; Cant (2010) have used RSM to provided a safety model with the aim of minimizing incident rates. Safety intervention data were collected from the environmental health and safety department of an oil company. The model was developed to determine the safety intervention factors and interactions which minimize incident rates, with the aim of predicting a better resource allocation strategy.\nUsing numerical simulations (in CFD) and applying the RSM, Vianna (2012) has developed a predictive model to calculate the overpressure generated during an explosion. The mathematical model allowed to find the desired response using two main variables as input: the gas cloud size and the ignition point.\nHuser &amp; Kvernvold (2000) developed a work applying the response surface methodology to predict the generation of a flammable gas cloud. The authors have found a mathematical model to calculate the flammable gas cloud size on offshore platforms using the correlations described by Cleaver et al. (1999). A large number of CFD simulations, with different scenarios of gas releases, have been carried out to obtain response surfaces.\nThis methodology allowed to calculate the flammable gas cloud size using two response surfaces: one considering the influence of wind speed and the leak rate and the other dealing with the wind direction.\nThe effects of wind speed and leak rate were combined in a non-dimensional variable R, with the same physical meaning that one developed by Cleaver et al. (1999):\nQg =\tm/Pg\nQa\t(Q are f/u re f)u\n(4.4)\nwhere:\nu is the wind speed;\nQaref /uref is the reference ventilation rate;\nQg is the gas volumetric flow rate;\nQa is the air volumetric flow rate;\nUsing the value of R as input, it is possible to calculate the flammable gas cloud size by\nthe following equations:\nVl =\tC3\nv - 1 +\t+ CR\n(4.5)\nHere V is the volume of the module under study, Vf is the flammable gas cloud size and P1, P2, C1 and C3 are constants to be determined from CFD analysis in order to obtain the best fit. The parameter C2 is derived from the second equation (Equation 4.6) as function of the maximum cloud size.\nVfmax\nA + B cos(a - amax)\nVfmaxW\nV\na\taw\na = aw\n(4.6)\nV\nThe parameters in Equation 4.6 are:\nA and B - constants dependant of the leak direction, determined from CFD simulations;\na - the wind direction;\naW - the wind direction that opposes a large structure in the module causing large recirculation zones and, consequently large clouds;\nafmax - the wind direction that gives the largest gas cloud, except aw. It is related to the leak direction;\nVfmax - the largest flammable cloud.\nThe method developed by Huser &amp; Kvernvold (2000) has brought advances in the analysis of flammable gas clouds, especially for making it independent of the installation. However, the use of two equations is not still desirable. It suggest that further studies must be conducted in order to improve the method and its reliability.\nChapter 5\nCase Study\nThis chapter shows the considerations and tools that were adopted in the dispersion simulations and development of the response surface model.\n5.1\tGeometry and mesh\nA typical offshore module was chosen to be used as geometry under study. As seen in Figure 5.1, the platform is considered having two deck levels, which comprise the process area. Its size is 110mx 100 m and it lies at 55 metres above sea level.\nFigure 5.1: A platform geometry based in an offshore module.\nIn some preliminary analysis only a single deck (Figure 5.2) was considered. During the study of the wind speed profile and computational domain size a simplified geometry was used in order to spend less computational effort.\nFigure 5.2: Simplified geometry with a single deck (Main Deck).\nDue the complexity of the geometry a unstructured tetrahedral mesh was adopted. The software ANSYSICEM -11.0 was used to construct the geometry and mesh.\n5.2\tDesign of the dispersion simulations\nBased on the findings from the design of experiments discussed in Section 4.1.1, the range of the variables relevant for the analysis were identified.\n5.2.1\tVariables of interest\nThe variables of interest in this study are those that influence the gas dispersion and also the flammable cloud size, discussed in Chapter 2. However, to develop the response surface, two main factors were considered: one that accounted for the effect of the ventilation and leak rate, and other that computed the relation between the wind and leak direction.\n5.2.1.1\tVentilation and leak rate\nBased on the works conducted by Cleaver et al. (1999) and Huser &amp; Kvernvold (2000), the ventilation and leak rate were analysed through the non-dimensional factor \"R\" (Equation 4.4).\nHuser &amp; Kvernvold (2000) argue that the flammable cloud size increases as R increases, until it reaches the maximum value and then it reduces. Based on the historical measurements the maximum flammable cloud size is achieved for R = 0.1 and that for large values of R the cloud size is too little.\nIn risk analysis, when developing a response surface, we are interested in the worst case scenario. It corresponds to the maximum achievable overpressure that is fairly related to the largest flammable cloud. Therefore, a range from 0.03 to 0.3, for the parameter R was selected in order to account for various cloud sizes.\n5.2.1.2\tLeak and wind direction\nThe effect of leak direction and wind direction was combined in a variable named \"phi\" (^). It was defined as the angle formed between the leak and wind direction.\nEight wind directions were considered as illustrated in Figure 5.3 below.\nFigure 5.3: Wind directions in the platform.\nIt is important to note that, the wind direction coming from east interacts with the accommodation module (represented by the large blue block in the right side of the platform -Figures 5.1 and 5.3). Large recirculation zones are created into the module and the ventilation rate is considerably reduced. So the wind coming from east had to be carefully analysed.\nThe leakage was represented by a little box in the centre of the platform and can take six orthogonal directions: x+, x-, y+, y-, z+ and z-. The identification of these directions was assessed according to the platform orientation. Figure 5.4 shows the possible orientations and the leakage representation into the module.\nFigure 5.4: Possible directions of the leakage and its representation into the platform.\nConsidering the leak directions, for the orientations x and y, the angle&lt;p is given as following:\n\u2022\t<p = 0: the leakage and the wind have the same direction;\n\u2022\t<p = 180: the leakage and the wind have the opposite direction;\nFor a specific leak direction \"p\", taking as reference&lt;p = 0, the others values of&lt;p were found varying the wind direction in counter-clockwise. Figure 5.5 shows a example wherep = y+, the same approach was adopted to leak directions x+, x- and y-.\nV ariation on Wind direction\nFigure 5.5: Schematic representation of the angle for a leakage in the direction y+.\nThe leak directions z+ and z were analysed apart. Because the wind is perpendicular to the leakage the angle&lt;p is the same for all wind directions.\nThe angle&lt;p is a qualitative variable and can take values among 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. Ranging from 45 degrees it gives 9 possible amounts, which is not desirable in design of experiments.\nConsidering&lt;p in a trigonometric cycle, four quadrants were established, each one with three values of&lt;p:\n\u2022\tQuadrant 01:\t= 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 ;\n\u2022\tQuadrant 02:\t= 90\u00b0, 135\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 ;\n\u2022\tQuadrant 03:\t= 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0 and 270\u00b0 ;\n\u2022\tQuadrant 04:\t= 270\u00b0, 315\u00b0 and 360\u00b0.\n5.2.2\tSimulations set up\nBased on the variables and their range, an experimental design 32 was conducted for each quadrant where the variables R and&lt;p taken on three values. For the variable&lt;p, the values of the quadrants described above were adopted , while for factor R, the values were 0.03, 0.15 and 0.3. Different scenarios of wind and leak direction and wind speed and leak rate were considered to represent the desirable values of R and&lt;p.\n5.3\tNatural gas composition and release conditions\nA typical composition of natural gas in a offshore module was adopted in the simulations\n(Table 5.1).\nTable 5.1: Natural Gas Composition.\nComponent\tMolar Fraction\nC1\t0.861\nC2\t0.071\nC3\t0.030\nC4\t0.013\nC5 +\t0.010\nCO2\t0.005\nN2\t0.010\nA pressurized gas pipeline was considered. The average pressure was taken as 200 kgf/cm2.\nIn pipelines at high pressure, the fluid flow at the leakage is sonic, which involves high pressure and velocity gradients. For gas flow, great variations in pressure lead to changes in specific mass and temperature, and the compressibility becomes an important factor in the fluid flow. All these conditions increase the complexity of the numerical solution.\nTo solve this question, HSL (2003) suggests that the region near the leakage is not modelled. The leakage modelling starts a little further the release point where the flow can be considered subsonic. This simplification is possible by keeping the mass flow constant and taking an orifice area that gives a velocity lower than 360 m/s (sound speed).\n5.4\tBoundary conditions and solver parameters\nThe simulations were performed using the ANSYS CFX 12.0 CFD software. This software uses an element-based finite volume method. The boundary conditions and parameters used at the simulations are presented in Tables 5.2 and 5.3, respectively.\nTable 5.2: Boundary conditions of the simulations.\nRegion\tBoundary Condition\nSurfaces\tno slip condition\nLeakage\tprescribed mass flow\nWind Source\tprescribed velocity\nComputational Domain Contour\tRelative Pressure = 0\nTable 5.3: Simulation Parameters.\nParameter\tValue or type\nReference Pressure\t1 atm\nFlow Regime\tStationary and Incompressible (Subsonic)\nTurbulence Model\tk - e\nAdvection Scheme\tUpwind\nTime scale\tAuto timescale (1.0)\nConvergence Criterion\tRSM\nMaximum Residual\t1 x 10-5\nMinimum and Maximum Number of Iterations\t100 - 1000\nIn Table 5.2, the no slip condition indicates that the velocity on the surfaces is zero. It means that a boundary layer is developed in the fluid flow and the velocity increases from the surfaces until the flow is fully developed.\nAt the regions \"leakage\" and \"wind source\" the boundary conditions assumed prescribed values. The vector that represents the mass flow and the velocity is directed into the computational domain enabling the entrance of fluid flow.\nIn fourth boundary condition, the relative pressure was set to zero which ensures no pressure difference between the computational domain and the outer region. Thus the domain contour represents just a limit for the calculations and the outer region of the computational domain can be understood as a continuation of the internal region.\nIn Table 5.3, the first parameter indicates that the value of 1 atm was used as the reference pressure for the calculations.\nThe simulations were conducted considering the stationary and incompressible flow regime. The flammable cloud size is calculated when it reaches the stationary condition: the cloud\nstops to grow and presents a constant volume.\nIn numerical solution of the transport equations a Reynods-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach was used. The k - s turbulence model was chosen because it provides good results for dispersion simulations and is easy to apply (as discussed in Section 3.2.1.2).\nIn CFX solver different discretization methods are applied to solve the differential equations. First and second order advection schemes can be selected to calculate the advection terms in the discrete finite volume equations. Based on the finite-element method, shape functions are used to evaluate the diffusion terms.\nThe Upwind scheme was chosen to solve the advection terms in the discretized equations. It is a first order numerical scheme and gives a robust performance for typically convective problems (as gas dispersion for example).\nIn the upwind scheme, interpolation functions are used to estimate the magnitude of the variables and its derivatives on the faces of the control volume from their respective values at the nodal point (ANSYS CFX (2011)). The value of the property&lt;p at an interface is equal to the value of&lt;p at the grid point on the upwind side of the face.\nFor steady-state problems, the CFX solver applies a false time-step as a means of underrelaxing the equations as they iterate towards the final solution. The Auto timescale is a fluid timescale control option that uses a internally calculated physical time-scale based on the boundary conditions, flow conditions and domain geometry. This is usually robust and conservative (ANSYS CFX (2011)). The factor 1.0 was used as multiplier the auto time-scale value calculated by the solver.\nThe RSM (Root Mean Square) residual was used as the convergence criterion. It represents a measure of how well the solution is converged and can be obtained by plotting the residuals for each equation at the end of each time-step. A reasonably converged solution requires a maximum residual level no higher than 10-4 (ANSYS CFX (2011)). The value usually adopted for the maximum RSM residual is 10-5.\nA minimum and maximum number of iterations were defined. The first value ensures that a minimum number of iterations is done even if the maximum residual was achieved. For stationary flow conditions it is verified that the convergence criterion must be reached with less than 500 iterations (ANSYS CFX (2011)).\n5.5\tEstimating the flammable gas cloud size and development of the response surface model\nAfter the dispersion simulations, the flammable gas cloud sizes were calculated using ANSYS CFX - Post Processor. Two isosurfaces were defined based on the upper and lower flammable limits of natural gas (UFL = 15% and LFL = 5%, in volumetric fraction). A first isosurface covered the volume where the natural gas concentration was higher than LFL while the second isosurface comprised the volume where the natural gas concentration was smaller than UFL. The flammable region was defined by the difference between these two volumes and the function volumeInt was used to calculate the flammable volumes.\nThe analysis of the data was conducted in the software Statistica 7.0 that provided the mathematical tools to the development of the response surface model.\n44\nChapter 6\nCFD Results\nPrior to starting the simulations used in the development of the mathematical model, it was necessary to analyse the parameters that influence the phenomenon in order to obtain a reliable result. This chapter discusses results regarding the release and wind behaviours. It also presents a study of the computational domain size, mesh tests and the effect of accommodation module in the ventilation rate into the platform geometry.\n6.1\tStudy of gas jet release\nIn accidental release from pressurized pipelines, the momentum of gas is large and it behaves as a jet. An analysis concerning the jet behaviour and how it influences the gas dispersion is necessary once the gas cloud is preceded of it.\nCFD studies require experimental data to compare with the model and validate it. In cases of flammable gas dispersion in a process area it is infeasible to collect experimental data. However, it is possible to find several data for jet releases that can be used to validate the simulations of the leakage. Modelling correctly the gas behaviour near the leakage is a way to ensure that all dispersion cases are properly modelled.\nFollowing the validation near the leak release, the jet behaviour was investigated taking into account the gas composition.\n6.1.1\tAxisymmetric jet simulation\nIn order to investigate how to model and simulate an axisymmetric jet behaviour, a typical high pressure jet was chosen. It consists a jet of air, originated from an orifice with 2.7 mm of diameter. The exit conditions were Mach number 1 and air density 2.25 kg/m3 (Birch (1987)).\nFigure 6.1 shows the computational domain and mesh that was used in the simulation. A computational domain was defined as a box with size of 0.3 m in its basis and 3 metres of height. An unstructured tetrahedral mesh with a special refinement in the exit and along the central axis of the jet was used, which gave a mesh with 1,700,000 elements.\nFigure 6.1: Geometry and mesh used in the Axisymmetric Jet study.\nThe boundary conditions used in this simulation are shown in Table 6.1.\nFigure 6.2 shows the result of the simulation. The vertical axis represents a non-dimensional velocity that is defined by ratio between the centreline jet velocity and the velocity at the exit of the jet. The horizontal axis represents the ratio between the axial distance (x) and the orifice diameter (d). It is possible to observe that the simulation result is very close to the experimental data, which indicate that the model used to simulate an axisymmetric jet is appropriated.\nTable 6.1: Simulation Parameters for the Axisymmetric Jet study.\nParameter\tValue or type\nReference Pressure\t1 atm\nFlow Regime\tIsothermal, Stationary, Subsonic and Incompressible\nTurbulence Model\tk - e\nAdvection Scheme\tUpwind\nTime scale\tauto timescale (1.0)\nConvergence Criterion\tRSM\nMaximum Residue\t1 X 10-5\nMaximum Number of Interactions\t1000\nFigure 6.2: Simulation of a high pressure axisymmetric jet.\n6.1.2\tHigh aspect ratio jet simulation\nThe high aspect ratio jet study was performed based on the work of Wakes (2002), who conducted an experimental investigation about the principles that affect the high aspect ratio crosssectional jet behaviour. An experimental apparatus was built using a pressurized air pipeline with a flange failure in gasket. Several flange failures with different aspect ratio was tested and using different values of pressure at the pipeline.\nFigure 6.3(a) shows the geometry of flange leaks used in the work of Wakes (2002). The delta (d) indicates the gasket thickness (that was 2 mm for all geometries), while a and \u00a13 indicate the angle of the inner and outer pipe, respectively. Nine different geometries were developed using this configuration and one of them was chosen to be reproduced and model a high aspect ratio jet: a = 75 and\u00a13 = 45 (6.3(b)).\nFigure 6.3: Schematic representation of the geometries of flange leaks (Wakes (2002)).\nThe aspect ratios of the selected geometry are 85.7:1 for the outer pipe and 26.6:1 for the inner pipe. The leak conditions were the pressure of 137.9 kPa and the mass flow rate of 0.15 kg/s.\nFirst, a axisymmetric jet with the conditions described on the Wakes (2002) work was simulated. A circular orifice with 25.5 mm of diameter was defined to represent the leakage and a box with size of 1 m in its basis and 10 m of height was set out as computational domain. A tetrahedral mesh was used and the number of mesh elements were about 2,100,000.\nThe simulation parameters were the same ones employed in section 6.1.1 (Table 6.1). Figure 6.4 presents the result of this simulation. It is observed that a high aspect ratio behaves in a different way to an axisymmetric jet.\nThe potential core of the axisymmetric jet is preserved for a larger space compared with a high aspect one, which means that the effective mix gas-air will start later in this jet. So, near the leakage, the generation of the flammable mixture will differ depending on the kind of the jet that will be used. However, in the far field their behaviours seem be alike and maybe the kind of the jet do not interferes in the flammable gas cloud size. So, some analysis will also be conducted to investigate this question.\n'5\no \"3 >\nS .\u00a7\ns u d -6\nZ\n0.6\n0.4\n<> \u2666 \t\u2014\t\t1 \t1\t\n\u2666 \\\t\u2666 Exper.

The computational domain was defined like a box with a rectangular basis (x = 0.3 m and z = 2 m) and 2 metres of height. Due to the small gasket thickness it was necessary to use a refined mesh at the leak zone that gave a great number of mesh elements (4,260,000). Figure\n6.5\tshows the geometry that has been used in this case.\nx\nX\nStart of Leak\nFigure 6.5: Geometric representation of a gasket failure in a flange.\nThe simulation of a high aspect jet behaviour had many problems. The parameters used for axisymmetric jet simulation could not be applied for this case and several tests was conducted\nto find out the best way to model this kind of jet behaviour. Table 6.2 presents some changes that has been done in the model and mesh for this attempts.\nTable 6.2: Parameters for the high aspect ratio jet study.\nCase\tParameter Modified\tMesh Features\nSimulation01\tHybrid advection scheme\tNo changes on mesh\nSimulation02\tHybrid advection scheme and time scale of 0.01\tNo changes on mesh\nSimulation03\tHybrid advection scheme\tRefinement on mesh\nFigure 6.6 shows the simulation results for the cases described in Table 6.2. It is possible to observe that the results do not agree faithfully with the experimental data.\nThe best result was achieved using a hybrid advection scheme and a extra-refined mesh (case Simulation03). However the refinement gave a too large mesh with 9,280,000 elements that, combined with the advection scheme, greatly increase the computational effort.\nFigure 6.6: Simulation of a high aspect ratio jet behaviour using diferent parameters.\nThe difficulties in simulating a high aspect ratio jet behaviour suggest the need further investigation in order to improve the modelling. Thus, a traditional circular orifice shape was chosen to represent the leakage in the dispersion simulations.\n6.1.3\tStudy of the natural gas jet\nThe flammable gas clouds are formed from releases with great mass flow rate. A release of 80 kg/s of natural gas was chosen. Taking the upstream release pressure as 200 kgf/cm2 and considering the specific heat ratio of methane (the major component in natural gas) as 1.29, the gas density and temperature at the leakage are 1.44 kg/m3 and -115 \u00b0C, respectively. At these release conditions, a sonic flow is developed.\nAs discussed in section 5.3, when the fluid flow is supersonic the numerical solution becomes complex and a strategy used in dispersion studies is consider just the leakage region where the fluid flow is subsonic. Thus, an average velocity of 340 m/s (lower than sound speed) was adopted so that the area of the leakage was 0.1634 m2 and the diameter of the orifice was 0.456 metres.\nIt is important to note that the diameter described above is not the real leak diameter but just an \"apparent diameter\", that was used to solve the subsonic part of the fluid flow. The real leak diameter can be found applying a discharge model as described in Lees (2005).\nAs in previous jet studies, a rectangular box was defined as the computational domain with 10 m in its base and 100 m of height. A tetrahedral mesh was used and the number of mesh elements were about 2,200,000. Figure 6.7 shows the computational domain and mesh that was used in this simulation.\nFigure 6.7: Computational domain and mesh used in the natural gas jet simulation.\nThe boundary conditions were the same ones that will be used in the dispersion simulations\n(Tables 5.2 and 5.3). The results are presented below.\nThe spreading angle of the jet relates directly with the flammable gas cloud size that will be formed. The flammable cloud size increases as the spreading angle increases. The explosive mixture is also reached quicker. Figure 6.8 shows the spreading angle for the natural gas simulation.\n1,750\t5.250\nFigure 6.8: Spreading angle of the natural gas jet.\nIt was possible to evaluate the spreading angle of the jet as been 15.8\u00b0. This value is a little different that one described by Lees (2005), who suggests a theoretic spreading angle of 18\u00b0, but, it is close to the experimental values found by Wakes (2002): 12\u00b0. Even when using a circular orifice, the spreading angle of the jet is near to the high aspect ratio one, which means a good representation of the real release.\nAnother important variable to describe the jet behaviour is the velocity profile. The centreline velocity profile shows how the velocity of the jet decreases with the distance from the release point, which implies where and when the mixture of the gas and air will reach a concentration within the flammable limits.\nThe centreline velocity profile of the jet is shown in Figure 6.9. Figure 6.10 shows the velocity profile of the jet at different heights, ranging from 0.05 metres to 100 metres away from the leak release.\nThe behaviour of the jet depends on the velocity profile at the gas entrance in the\ncomputational domain. Wakes (2003) suggests to set up a velocity profile in the entrance, for release simulations. In this study the mass flow rate was specified at the leakage and the velocity profile was developed from it.\nFigure 6.9: Natural gas velocity profile in the centreline of the jet.\nFigure 6.10: Natural gas superficial velocity profile at different heights.\nThe concentration levels are also an important variable to be studied in the jet. They are used to determine whether an area is within the upper and lower flammability limits and therefore whether it is at risk of explosion (Wakes (2002)). The natural gas molar fraction along the jet was analysed . The flammable limits are given in volumetric fraction.\nFigure 6.11 shows the natural gas molar fraction in the centreline of the jet. It is possible to observe that the gas concentration in the centreline of the jet reaches the flammability region 40 metres distant from the origin of the release.\n0.8\n0.4\n0.2\nAxial Distance - z (in)\nFigure 6.11: Natural gas molar fraction profile in the centreline of the jet.\nluu\n6.2\tWind analysis\nIn Chapter 2 (Section 2.3) it was discussed the importance of wind speed and direction when dealing with flammable clouds. In this section it will be shown how to model the wind profile.\nIn atmospheric studies a superficial atmospheric boundary layer (SABL) is defined between the surface and the air. It presents a turbulent behaviour with large variations in temperature, humidity and wind speed with height.\nA vertical wind speed profile is observed in SABL. Due to the wind shear, the velocity is zero near the surface and increases exponentially with the height until becomes almost constant at high values of z. Figure 6.12 illustrates a typical wind speed profile.\nIn figure 6.12 above, z0 is the roughness length and it represents the height where the velocity is zero.\nThe wind speed profile in atmospheric boundary layer can not be easily assessed due to many parameters influencing the phenomenon. The most common model used to describe this profile is the Monin-Obukhov theory.\nThe Monin-Obukhov theory, in homogeneous and stationary flow conditions, predicts a log-linear profile:\nw(z) =\nK\n(6.1)\nHere:\nu(z) is the wind speed at height z (m/s);\nw* is the friction velocity (m/s);\nk is the Von Karman constant (taken as 0.41);\nz0 is the surface roughness length (m);\nis a universal stability function;\nL is the Monin-Obukhov length (m).\nAccording to equation 6.1, knowing the wind speed at one height, it is possible to determine a wind speed profile through two parameters: the surface roughness and the Monin-Obukhov length.\nThe surface roughness can be estimated by vertical wind profile data. It varies depending on the surface, in water, for example, the value of z0 is very low compared to the land. Additionally, the surface roughness may not be constant. In sea, it depends on the wave field, which in turn is determined by wind speed, distance to coast, etc (Lange et al. (2004)).\nThe Monin-Obukhov length, L, expresses the relationship between the convective and the turbulent flow. It is used to take account the atmospheric stability, being positive during stable conditions (night-time), negative during unstable conditions (daytime) and approaches infinity for neutral conditions (Hanna (1982)). It is defined as:\nu3\nL =--------*\t(6.2)\nK(g/T )(-w'T')\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (m/s2), T is the absolute temperature (K), and (-w'T') is the surface heat flux (J/m2).\nDifferent methods are available to derivate the Monin-Obukhov length. Some examples are sonic, gradient and bulk method. Values for L can also be found on tables as function of wind speed and meteorological conditions (AICHE (2000)).\nFor neutral conditions, the equation 6.1 can be simplified. In this case: L - w, and the second term in its equation is set to zero:\nu(z) = - ln(\u2014\\\nK \\Z0j\n(6.3)\nThe equation 6.3 can become a power law relation if the velocity is compared to a velocity at a fixed height (Hanna (1982)):\n(6.4)\nu(z) = U10I\nHere, u10 is the wind speed at height 10 metres and p is the power coefficient. The power coefficient is a function of atmospheric stability and surface roughness.\n6.2.1\tWind speed profile tests\nThe area under study comprises an offshore module that lies at approximately 55 metres above sea level. At this height it is expected that the wind boundary layer is fully developed and the wind speed is almost constant. To examine if it was possible to consider the velocity as constant or if it was necessary to set a velocity profile for this dispersion study, tests were performed using equations 6.1, 6.3 and 6.4 for wind speed profile.\nFor this wind speed analysis, an average wind velocity of 6.5 m/s at 10 m over sea level was adopted. A neutral atmospheric was chosen and it was necessary to estimate the Monin-Obukhov length (L), surface roughness (zo), friction velocity (u*) and power coefficient (p) for this stability condition.\nTypical values of L, z0 and p can be found in AICHE (2000). For neutral stability atmospheric class and sea surface they are given in Table 6.3.\nTable 6.3: Values of L, z0 and p for neutral atmospheric and sea surface.\nMonin-Obukhov length (L) (m)\t> 100\nsurface roughness (z0) (m)\t1 x 10 1\npower coefficient (p)\t0.15\nz0 can also be obtained through models for sea surface. The most common model takes into account the wave field by its dependence on friction velocity u* and is known as the Charnock relation (Charnock (1955)):\nu2\nZ0 = Zch\u2014\t(6.5)\ng\nHere, zch is the empirical Charnock parameter and its standard value of zch = 0.0185 has been used.\nSince it is a preliminary analysis, in order to reduce the computational costs, the tests were conducted on a simple geometry, just with a single deck (as showed in Figure 5.2). A computational\ndomain starting on level of the sea (z = 0) was also used.\nFigures 6.13, 6.14 and 6.15 show the results of the simulations. It is possible to recognize the wind exponential profile, as seen in Figure 6.12, for all simulated equations.\nFor equations 6.3 and 6.4, the profiles are very similar (Figures 6.14 and 6.15). In these cases the wind speed at heights over 30 m practically does not change. For equation 6.1 (Figure 6.13), it is presented a slight variation on wind speed even with the developed profile (approximately 1 m/s at heights between 40 and 90 metres).\nThe difference between the results is due to considerations that have been done during the development of equations. Equation 6.1 is the most complete, but it requires many parameters that should be estimated, while equations 6.3 and 6.4 are simpler.\nIt can be observed in all Figures (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) that at heights over 55m (offshore module level considered) the wind speed profile is almost constant. So that a constant value of wind speed can be used on next simulations.\n\t120\t1 1\ti\t|\ti\t|\ti\t|\ti\t|\ti\tr\t1 1\n\t110\t\ti \u25a0\t-\n\t100\t\t/\t-\n\t\t\t\t-\n\t90\t\tJ \u25a0\t\u2014\n\t80\t\t\u25a0 i \u25a0 \u25a0\t-\n's \u2022\u2014<\t70\t\tJ \u25a0\t-\nsi\t\t\t\u25a0\t-\n1\t60\t\tl\t\u2014\nbi)\t\t\t\u25a0\t-\n\u2022 i\u2014&lt;tD\t50\t\tJ\t\nK\t\t\t\u25a0 \u25a0\t\n\t40\t\t\u25a0 I\t-\n\t\t\ti\t-\n\t30\t\t\u25a0 \u25a0 /\t\u2014\n\t20\t\t\u25a0\t\n\t\t\t\t-\n\t10\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t\t-\n\tA\t1 1\u201e\t\u25a0i\t1\ti 1 i 1 i L\t1 1\nO1______i_____I____...i...I.....i.\u201e.**1______i_____I_____i_____I_____i_____I_____i_____l_\n0\t2\t4\t6\t8\t10\t12\t14\nVelocity u (m/s)\nFigure 6.13: Vertical wind speed profile - Equation 6.1.\nHeight z (m)\tHeight z (m)\nFigure 6.14: Vertical wind speed profile - Equation 6.3.\nFigure 6.15: Vertical wind speed profile - Equation 6.4.\n6.3\tComputational domain size and mesh test\n6.3.1\tComputational domain size\nA study was performed in order to check which computational domain size can be used on the simulations. Here, a simple geometry (as showed in Figure 5.2) was also adopted and three computational domains with different size were chosen (Table 6.4). A wind speed of 6 m/s blowing from east was considered in the simulation and the ventilation into the module was analysed.\nTable 6.4: Size of the computational domains under study.\nDomain\tx(m)\ty(m)\tz(m)\tMesh elements\nComputational Domain 01 (CD01)\t142\t124\t72\t2,354,843\nComputational Domain 02 (CD02)\t262\t242\t72\t3,848,189\nComputational Domain 03 (CD03)\t348\t328\t72\t5,314,616\nFigure 6.16 shows the wind velocity field in a plane at height 2.5 m over the main deck using the three computational domains. It is possible to observe that large recirculation zones are formed into the module and they are better defined when the computational domain contour is further away (as in Figure 6.16 (b) and (c)). In a qualitative analysis, there seems to be not much difference in recirculation zones when using the computational domains CD02 and CD03, which suggests that both CD02 and CD03 could be used in the proposed study.\nA quantitative analysis was also performed. Thirty nine monitoring points were distributed into the module considering three different levels: at height 2.5, 10 and 20 metres over the main deck (thirteen points for each plane) and the average wind velocity was calculated in each one of them. Figure 6.17 shows the monitoring points in the platform region. Figures 6.18, 6.19 and 6.20 shows the scattering among the values of average wind velocity calculated in monitoring points when different computational domain sizes are used.\n(a) Computational Domain CD01\nVelocity\nVector 1\no\t50.00\t1 00.00 (m)\n25.000\t75.00\n(b) Computational Domain CD02\n(c) Computational Domain CD03\nFigure 6.16: Wind velocity field in a plan at height 2.5 m over the main deck using the computational domains CD01 (a), CD02 (b) and CD03 (3).\n45.00\t90.00 (m)\nI\n22.500\t67.50\nFigure 6.17: Platform geometry with monitoring points.

However, according to Table 6.4, as the computational domain increases, mesh increases too. The computational domain CD02 gives an intermediate mesh and provides similar results to the computational domain CD03 that is - 1.4 times bigger.\n6.3.2\tMesh tests\nAs well as the computational domain size, the correct choice about mesh size is also important in CFD analysis. The control volumes should be dimensioned so that their size does not interfere in numerical solution.\nA dispersion scenario with a wind speed of 4 m/s coming from east and a natural gas release of 150 kg/s in direction y+ was chosen. The entirely platform geometry were used and the computational domain CD02 was selected (as discussed in previous section).\nThree meshes with different refinement on the platform regions were analysed. They are presented in Tables 6.5, 6.6 and 6.7.\nIn all three meshes, a growth rate of 20% was selected. It means that starting from the smallest control volume, the next element will be 20% bigger than the preceding element until it achieve the largest element size that can exist into the computational domain (defined as \"global size\").\nA notation was defined for the leakage region based on the number of elements that it will contain. Looking to tables below, in Mesh 01 the leakage was load with 5 control volumes while in Mesh 02 it will contain 12 elements and in Mesh 03, 20 elements.\nTable 6.5: Refinement on platform regions according to Mesh 01.\nRegion\tMax. element size (m)\nLeakage\tr/5\nFacilities\t1\nDecks\t5\nGlobal size\t10\nTotal of elements: 1,459,149\nTable 6.6: Refinement on platform regions according to Mesh 02.\nRegion\tMax. element size (m)\nLeakage\tr/12\nFacilities\t0.5\nDecks\t3\nGlobal size\t7\nTotal of elements: 3,095,377\nTable 6.7: Refinement on platform regions according to Mesh 03.\nRegion\tMax. element size (m)\nLeakage\tr/20\nFacilities\t0.3\nDecks\t2\nGlobal size\t6\nTotal of elements: 5,799,324\nThe numerical solutions provided by each mesh were analysed based on both ventilation rate into the module and flammable gas cloud size.\nSimilarly to the computational domain size study, here, the average wind velocity into the platform was calculated in 39 monitoring points (the same ones previously described in Section 6.3.1). Figures 6.21, 6.22 and 6.23 show the comparision between the values of average wind velocity calculated in monitoring points when different mesh sizes are used.\nFigure 6.21: Comparision between the values of average wind velocity in monitoring points located in the first level (at 2.5 m over main deck).\nFigure 6.22: Comparision between the values of average wind velocity in monitoring points located in the second level (at 10 m over main deck).\nFigure 6.23: Comparision between the values of average wind velocity in monitoring points located in the third level (at 20 m over main deck).\nThe analysis of the plots shows that when using Mesh 02 the calculated values are near those provided by Mesh 03 (differences in the calculated wind velocities were between 4 and 9% for almos all monitoring points). However, when comparing both Meshes 02 and 03 with Mesh 01 the differences in the calculated wind speed is higher (^ 15 %).\nThe flammable gas cloud sizes were also calculated. The flammable volumes obtained when using meshes 01, 02 and 03 were 7,308 m3, 8,943 m3 and 9,325 m3, respectively. It is possible to verify that difference in the flammable volume provided by meshes 02 and 03 is small (~ 4%). However, comparing mesh 01 and 02 the difference is almost 22 % and this value increases to 27.6 % when considering mesh 01 and 03.\nBoth analysis of wind velocity and the calculated flammable volumes show a little difference in numerical solution when considering meshes 02 and 03 in the simulations, so both can be used. However, it is observed that mesh 03 is more refined than mesh 02 which gives more elements into the calculation domain and, consequently, increases the computational time. Thus a mesh like mesh 02 will be adopted on next simulations.\n6.4\tEvaluating the influence of accommodation module in ven-\ntilation rate\nIn order to check how the presence of the accommodation module can influence the ventilation rate in the platform some tests were performed considering the eight possible wind directions described in Section 5.2.1.2.\nThree different values of wind velocity were analysed: 2, 4 and 6.5 m/s. Figures 6.24, 6.25 and 6.26 show the differences in ventilation rate into the module when considering or not the accommodation module. It is possible to observe for all wind speed that the ventilation rate into the module is similar for all wind directions (the differences are lower than 10%), when the accommodation module is neglected in platform geometry.\nWhen considering the accommodation module in platform geometry, the presence of the such structure reduces 36% the ventilation rate into the module for wind coming from east and -11% for west wind . For other wind directions, the presence of the accommodation module hardly affects the ventilation rate in the platform (approximately 5%).\nFigure 6.24: Comparing the ventilation rate into the offshore module, for a wind speed of 2 m/s when considering or not the accommodation module in geometry.\nFigure 6.25: Comparing the ventilation rate into the offshore module, for a wind speed of 4 m/s when considering or not the accommodation module in geometry.\nFigure 6.26: Comparing the ventilation rate into the offshore module, for a wind speed of 6.5 m/s when considering or not the accommodation module in geometry.\n6.4.1\tThe variable R\nAccording to equation 4.4 if the ventilation rate varies the variable R also changes, so R is affected by the presence of the accommodation module in the geometry.\nIn order to find the desirable values of R (0.03, 0.15 and 0.3) values of mass flow rate of natural gas were calculate through equation 4.4. The ventilation rate provided by the east wind velocities of 2, 4 and 6.5 m/s when the accommodation module is included or not in the geometry and the release conditions given in section 5.3 were considered.\nThe values of mass flow rate combined with the wind speed to obtain R equal to 0.03, 0.15 and 0.3 when the accommodation module is included or not are shown in Tables 6.8 and 6.9. It is possible to verify that to achieve same values of R different mass flow rate must be used for platform geometry with and without the accommodation module.\nAnother observation is that as R increase, mass flow rate increases too and depending on the wind velocity it reaches impractical values. It explains why a range of 0.03 - 0.3 was chosen for the variable R.\nTable 6.8: Mass flow rate of natural gas calculated to provide desirable values of R based on the average ventilation rate when the accommodation module is neglected in platform geometry.\nR\tVelocity u = 2 m/s\tM.

It also covers the comparison between the values of flammable gas cloud size obtained in CFD simulations with those predicted by the response surface model.\n7.1 Developing a response surface model considering releases in a horizontal plane\nBased on the analysis discussed in Section 5.2.1, the variable p was defined as the angle formed between the leak and wind direction considering the leak in the orientations x and y (in a horizontal plane).\nInitially, the accommodation module was not considered in platform geometry. The process area was assumed symmetric so that the wind direction has little influence on ventilation rate. Such strategy was adopted to verify the effect of the variable p on flammable cloud size and also make sure if it was possible to develop a response surface based on the two proposed variables. Dispersion scenarios including the accommodation module in the geometry were analysed later.\nAs seen in Section 5.2.2 an experimental design with 9 tests were developed for each\nquadrant. The CFD cases listed in Table 7.1 presents the variables R and p and the configuration of leak and wind direction used in each dispersion scenario. The calculated flammable volumes are also shown. Some dispersion scenario plots can be found in Appendix B.\nThe progress of the simulations in ANSYS CFX -12.0 was monitored by the convergence criterion: RSM (Root Mean Square) residual &lt;1.0 x 10-5. For all simulated cases, a number between 200 and 300 iterations were required to reach such criterion.\nA monitoring point was placed into the platform region and the development of the flammable cloud was also verified. When the final solution was close to be achieved the calculated flammable volume in this point became constant.\nTable 7.1: Dispersion Scenarios Based on an Experimental Design.\nScenario\tQuadrant\tR\tP\tLeak Dir.\tWind Dir.\tFlammable cloud size (m3)\n01\t01\t0.03\t0\tx+\tW\t1095.24\n02\t01\t0.03\t45\tx-\tNE\t1933.70\n03\t01\t0.03\t90\ty+\tE\t1635.73\n04\t01\t0.15\t0\ty-\tN\t7891.46\n05\t01\t0.15\t45\tx+\tSW\t5313.24\n06\t01\t0.15\t90\tx-\tN\t5769.19\n07\t01\t0.3\t0\ty+\tS\t5875.72\n08\t01\t0.3\t45\ty-\tNW\t15389.3\n09\t01\t0.3\t90\tx+\tS\t7629.71\n10\t02\t0.03\t90\tx-\tN\t2942.72\n11\t02\t0.03\t135\ty+\tNE\t1622.01\n12\t02\t0.03\t180\ty-\tS\t2942.43\n13\t02\t0.15\t90\tx+\tS\t7959.67\n14\t02\t0.15\t135\tx-\tNW\t9884.08\n15\t02\t0.15\t180\ty+\tN\t19040.90\n16\t02\t0.3\t90\ty-\tW\t13756.50\n17\t02\t0.3\t135\tx+\tSE\t9446.75\n18\t02\t0.3\t180\tx-\tW\t12027.80\n19\t03\t0.03\t180\ty+\tN\t3759.36\n20\t03\t0.03\t225\ty-\tSE\t2223.15\n21\t03\t0.03\t270\tx+\tN\t1852.17\n22\t03\t0.15\t180\tx-\tW\t17168.60\n23\t03\t0.15\t225\ty+\tNW\t8610.10\n24\t03\t0.15\t270\ty-\tE\t12630.40\n25\t03\t0.3\t180\tx+\tE\t11739.10\n26\t03\t0.3\t225\tx-\tSW\t10413.70\n27\t03\t0.3\t270\ty+\tW\t8765.37\n28\t04\t0.03\t270\ty-\tE\t5486.90\n29\t04\t0.03\t315\tx+\tNW\t1102.42\n30\t04\t0.03\t360\tx-\tE\t1594.47\n31\t04\t0.15\t270\ty+\tW\t5386.44\n32\t04\t0.15\t315\ty-\tNE\t9866.87\n33\t04\t0.15\t360\tx+\tW\t4201.90\n34\t04\t0.3\t270\tx-\tS\t7786.19\n35\t04\t0.3\t315\ty+\tSW\t7233.69\n36\t04\t0.3\t270\ty-\tN\t14263.1\nA response surface model was built to represent the numerical experiments and the correlation between the independent variables R and p and the flammable gas cloud size. A second order model (as given in Equation 4.3, Section 4.1.2) was chosen to describe the response surface.\nEven as the methodology adopted to represent al ranges of the variable p, the response surfaces were separately developed for each quadrant giving a amount of four different expressions:\n\u2022 Quadrant 01:\ny = -385.92 + 14,659.25 \u2022 xi + 37,794.39 \u2022 X2 + 6,443.20 \u2022 xi \u2022 X2\n(7.1)\n-51,900 \u2022 X12 - 164,004.60 \u2022 X22\nQuadrant 02:\ny = 14,927.24 + 45,874.62 \u2022\t- 115,476.00 \u2022 x2 - 11,566.97 \u2022 X1 \u2022 x2\t(7.2)\n-28,426.26 \u2022 x? + 178,819.63 \u2022 x22\n\u2022\tQuadrant 03:\ny = 57,011.28 + 47,897.71 \u2022 X1 - 181,355.90 \u2022 x2 - 4,032.97 \u2022 X1 \u2022 x2\t(7.3)\n-33,580.71 \u2022 x12 + 136,758.40 \u2022 x22\n\u2022\tQuadrant 04:\ny = 40,427.97 - 29,583.64 \u2022 X1 - 66,221.70 \u2022 x2 + 46,709.14 \u2022 X1 \u2022 x2\t(7.4)\n-3,156.67 \u2022 x12 - 24,672.43 \u2022 x22\nIn Equations 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 above x1 represents the variable R and x2 represents ^. The values of both variables are normalized. y is the response (flammable gas cloud size (m3)).\nThe graphical representation of the response surfaces is shown in Figure 7.1. The analysis of the plots indicate that the gas cloud behaviour is not same for all quadrants. On the other hand, there seems to be similarities for pairs of quadrants that represent the same relationship between the leak and wind direction.\nThe quadrants 02 and 03 (Figure 7.1 (b) and (c)) represent the series of angles where the leakage and the wind tend to have opposite directions. It is verified the maximum cloud volume is achieved when wind is entirely opposite to leakage and = 180\u00b0 (in normalised form = 0.5). However, for both quadrants, the variable does not have as much influence as R in the flammable cloud size.\nRegarding the variable R, these quadrants (02 and 03) exhibit a saddle profile. For small values of R (low ratio between leak rate and wind speed) the gas will be fast diluted by the air which leads to small flammable clouds. As R increases the concentration of the gas released increases too, giving larger flammable clouds. However, for large values of R, the gas concentrations exceed the Upper Flammable Limit (UFL) and the flammable cloud size reduces. A similar result is found in\n(a) Quadrant 01\n(b) Quadrant 02\nVol. (tn3)\n(c) Quadrant 03\n(d) Quadrant 04\nFigure 7.1: Response surface models for the Quadrants 01 (a), 02 (b), 03 (c) and 04 (d).\nother study about gas dispersion (Huser &amp; Kvernvold (2000)). It is also observed that values of R - 0.18 (in normalised form R - 0.6) yield the largest flammable clouds.\nThe flammable cloud behaviour for quadrants 02 and 03 explained above may be related to the fact that when wind and leakage take opposite directions an effective mixture between air and the released gas will occur. However when wind and leakage take the same direction (0\u00b0 &lt;<p &lt;90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0 &lt;<p &lt;360\u00b0) a different phenomenon is observed, as shown in Figure 7.1 (a) and (d) that represents the quadrants 01 and 04, respectively.\nFor quadrants 01 and 04 the flammable cloud size increases as R increases, so the largest flammable clouds are found for highest values of R. It means if we take a constant ventilation rate the higher the leak rate the greater will be the flammable volume.\nAs verified for the pair of quadrants 02-03, in quadrants 01 and 04 the influence of the variable R in the flammable cloud size is greater than ^. It is also important to note that the flammable volumes observed in quadrants 01-04 are smaller compared with the volumes found for quadrants 02 and 03.\nThe comparison between the flammable volumes obtained in CFD simulations with the values predicted by the response surface model is shown in Figure 7.2. It is possible to observe that almost all cases fall within 50% tolerance interval.\nBased on the simplifications and limitations, in dispersion analysis, a factor of two is considered to be acceptable to predict flammable cloud size (Hanna et al. (2004)). In this study, the differences among the simulated cases and the values predicted by the response surfaces are smaller (four times) than the adopted tolerance. Thus, the developed response surface model can provides a satisfactory performance when gas dispersion in an offshore module is considered.\n(a) Quadrant 01\n(c) Quadrant 03\nFigure 7.2: Comparison between the values obtained through CFD simulations and the response surface models to the Quadrants 01 (a), 02 (b), 03 (c) and 04 (d).

Vertical axis shows results predicted by the model proposed in this study. Horizontal axis shows cloud volumes obtained using CFD.\nThe response surfaces analysed until now were developed based on dispersion simulations disregarding the ventilation effects caused by the accommodation module in the platform geometry, but to obtained a complete model, they need be taken into account.\n7.1.2\tAccounting the influence of the accommodation module\nThe influence of the accommodation module in the variable p is unknown. May be the recirculation zones created by the interaction between this geometric structure and the east wind affect the adopted configuration of angles p. In this case, new response surfaces must be developed. In an optimistic view, the variable p will not be influenced by the recirculation zones and the first obtained response surfaces can also be applied for the geometry with the accommodation module.\nIn order to verify how the accommodation module influences the variable ^, some dispersion simulations were performed considering this structure in platform geometry.\nAs verified in Section 6.4, when the accommodation module is included in the platform, the ventilation rate is affected by the east and west wind direction (specially east wind). So such wind directions were analysed. Table 7.3 shows the dispersion scenarios adopted here.\nIt is important to keep in mind that, according to analysis given in section 6.4.1, to achieve the same values of variable R used before (R = 0.03, 0.15 and 0.3), different values mass flow rate were adopted in these cases when including the accommodation module in the geometry.\nTable 7.3: Dispersion Simulations Considering the Accommodation Module in Platform Geometry.\nScenario\tR\tWind Dir.\tLeak Dir.\t\tQuadrant\tFlammable cloud size (m3)\nEW01\t0.03\tE\tx+\t180\t2 and 3\t4114.85\nEW02\t0.15\tE\tx+\t180\t2 and 3\t18976.10\nEW 03\t0.3\tE\tx+\t180\t2 and 3\t14224.20\nEW 04\t0.03\tE\tx-\t0\t1 and 4\t1175.31\nEW 05\t0.15\tE\tx-\t0\t1 and 4\t3264.17\nEW 06\t0.3\tE\tx-\t0\t1 and 4\t3674.70\nEW 07\t0.03\tE\ty+\t90\t1 and 2\t1161.19\nEW 08\t0.15\tE\ty+\t90\t1 and 2\t3303.64\nEW 09\t0.3\tE\ty+\t90\t1 and 2\t4227.87\nEW 10\t0.03\tE\ty-\t270\t3 and 4\t2403.24\nEW 11\t0.15\tE\ty-\t270\t3 and 4\t7908.05\nEW 12\t0.3\tE\ty-\t270\t3 and 4\t8624.95\nWW 01\t0.03\tW\tx+\t0\t1 and 4\t1538.87\nWW 02\t0.15\tW\tx+\t0\t1 and 4\t14109.70\nWW 03\t0.3\tW\tx+\t0\t1 and 4\t17199.30\nWW 04\t0.03\tW\tx-\t180\t2 and 3\t3195.52\nWW 05\t0.15\tW\tx-\t180\t2 and 3\t14674.50\nWW 06\t0.3\tW\tx-\t180\t2 and 3\t10511.80\nWW 07\t0.03\tW\ty+\t270\t3 and 4\t1267.88\nWW 08\t0.15\tW\ty+\t270\t3 and 4\t4412.83\nWW 09\t0.3\tW\ty+\t270\t3 and 4\t7458.11\nWW 10\t0.03\tW\ty-\t90\t1 and 2\t2988.45\nWW 11\t0.15\tW\ty-\t90\t1 and 2\t7084.63\nWW 12\t0.3\tW\ty-\t90\t1 and 2\t12493.60\nThe first goal was not to develop a new response surface, but just to compare the results of the simulations accounting the accommodation module with the values predicted by the developed model by taking on the original configuration of angles p. Figure 7.4 shows such comparison.\nThe analysis of the plots in Figure 7.4 shows that the differences between the values predicted by the model and the results of the simulations are within a range of \u00b150%. This result is similar to that ones found before and allow us to conclude that the first obtained response surfaces can also be applied for the geometry with the accommodation module.\nSo, the developed model can describe all ventilation effects, including the wake wind effects caused by the accommodation module. Little adjustments are necessary just in the variable R when the dispersion scenario includes the wake wind side (in this case, east wind).\nFigure 7.4: Comparison between the values obtained through CFD simulations considering the accommodation module in the geometry and the Response Surface Models to the Quadrants 01 (a), 02 (b), 03 (c) and 04 (d). Vertical axis shows results predicted with the model proposed in this study. Horizontal axis shows cloud volumes obtained using CFD.\n7.2\tDeveloping a response surface model considering releases in \"z\" direction\nAs discussed in Section 5.2.1, the concept of&lt;p could not be applied for the leak directions z+ and z-. Thus, a new design of experiments was developed to account for the effect of these leak directions in flammable gas cloud size.\nA qualitative variable named \"z\" was used to describe the leak direction and could take two values: 0 for the leak direction z+ and 1 for the leak direction z-. The variable R was used to account the interaction between the leak and ventilation rate and the values of 0.03 and 0.3 were adopted. As each variable has taken only two values, a experimental design 22 was developed giving a amount of four experiments. The CFD cases are listed in Table 7.4.\nThe same strategy used before in the development of the response surfaces for the leak directions x+, x-, y+ and y- were also adopted in this analysis. Thus in the dispersion cases described in design of experiments the accommodation module was not included in platform geometry.\nTable 7.4: Dispersion Scenarios Based on an Experimental Design for Leak Direction z.\nScenario\tR\tz\tWind Dir.\tFlammable cloud size (m3)\n01\t0.03\tz+\tW\t938.97\n02\t0.3\tz+\tE\t7902.75\n03\t0.03\tz-\tS\t5303.08\n04\t0.3\tz-\tN\t37097.9\nBecause the variables have assumed only two values and few numerical experiments were conducted, a first order model (as given in Equation 4.2, Section 4.1.2) was used in the development of the response surface. The expression that describes the obtained reponse surface model is presented below:\ny = 165.2 + 7737.53 \u2022 x1 + 1605.11 \u2022 x2 + 27590.04 \u2022 x1 \u2022 x2\t(7.5)\nHere, x1 represents the variable R and x2 represents z. The values of both variables are normalized and y is the response (flammable gas cloud size (m3).\nThe graphical representation of the response surface model for leaks in z direction is shown in Figure 7.5. It is possible to verify that large flammable clouds are formed when the leak direction is z- (in the plot z = 1). In this case, the gas jet release interacts with the deck floor and its momentum greatly reduces so the gas dispersion is more effective giving a large flammable cloud. Regarding the variable R, it is observed that the flammable cloud size increases as R increases. Such behaviour is similar that one found for the quadrants 1 and 4 where leak and wind taken same direction.\nFigure 7.5: Response surface model for leakages in z direction.\nFigure 7.6 shows the comparison between the flammable volumes predicted by the developed model and the results obtained in CFD simulations. It is observed that the response surface model provides a very good agreement with CFD results.\nFigure 7.6: Comparison between the values obtained through CFD simulations and the response surface model for leakages in z direction. Vertical axis shows results predicted with the model proposed in this study. Horizontal axis shows cloud volumes obtained using CFD.\nRandom cases were also simulated in CFD in order to assess if the developed response surface model for releases in z direction was reliable. It was considered dispersion scenarios where the accommodation module was included or not in the platform geometry. Table 7.5 shows these random CFD simulations. It is important to observe that in the first twelve dispersion cases the accommodation module was not included in the geometry, while the last cases have accounted the effect of such structure in the platform geometry.\nTable 7.5: Random CFD Simulations.\nCase\tR\tz\tWind Dir.\tFlammable cloud size (m3)\nWithout A.M. 01\t0.03\tz+\tS\t383.11\nWithout A.M. 02\t0.09\tz+\tW\t4725.86\nWithout A.M. 03\t0.15\tz+\tNE\t5745.46\nWithout A.M. 04\t0.21\tz+\tNW\t4074.76\nWithout A.M. 05\t0.27\tz+\tSE\t6983.43\nWithout A.M. 06\t0.3\tz+\tSW\t8446.28\nWithout A.M. 07\t0.03\tz-\tN\t4057.14\nWithout A.M. 08\t0.09\tz-\tE\t22418.90\nWithout A.M. 09\t0.15\tz-\tNE\t25519.43\nWithout A.M. 10\t0.21\tz-\tNW\t25367.11\nWithout A.M. 11\t0.27\tz-\tSE\t44151.34\nWithout A.M. 12\t0.3\tz-\tSW\t39378.92\nWith A.M. 13\t0.03\tz+\tE\t363.31\nWith A.M. 14\t0.09\tz+\tW\t787.90\nWith A.M. 15\t0.15\tz+\tE\t2550.31\nWith A.M. 16\t0.21\tz+\tW\t3309.65\nWith A.M. 17\t0.27\tz+\tE\t2857.06\nWith A.M. 18\t0.3\tz+\tW\t6611.56\nWith A.M. 19\t0.03\tz-\tE\t4902.26\nWith A.M. 20\t0.09\tz-\tW\t10532.20\nWith A.M. 21\t0.15\tz-\tE\t22521.73\nWith A.M. 22\t0.21\tz-\tW\t23987.22\nWith A.M. 23\t0.27\tz-\tE\t24209.20\nWith A.M. 24\t0.3\tz-\tW\t39912.54\nThe comparison between the values predicted by the response surface model and the results of the CFD random dispersion simulations given above is shown in Figure 7.7. It is observed that almost all results fall within 50% tolerance interval, even when including or not the accommodation module in the platform geometry. So, as well as the response surface model developed for the leak directions x and y, the response surface obtained for the leak direction z also provided good fit with CFD results.\n40000\t50000\n50000\n40000 -\n30000 -\n20000 -\n\u2666 -\n10000 -\n8\no \u25a0d\n<u\n\u2014\nCL,\n\u2014I___\n10000\n\u2014I_______I_____I__\n20000\t30000\nVol. (m3) - CFD\n\u2014r J\n\u2666\tWithout Accommodation Module\n\u2666\tWith Accommodation Module\n----------------------r\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/ ,\nFigure 7.7: Comparing results from CFD simulations with response surface model for releases in z direction.

The variables that influence the phenomenon were identified and grouped in two factors: R that accounted the effect of the ventilation and leak rate, and p that computes the relation between the wind and leak direction.\nThe next step consisted in CFD modelling. Different analysis regarding the ventilation and leak rate were performed. Some tests were also conducted in order to find the mesh refinement and computational domain size that were used in dispersion simulations.\nTwo experimental cases of gas jet release were successfully reproduced in ANSYS CFX -12.0: an axisymmetric and a high aspect ratio jet. The simulation of an axisymmetric jet was easier performed and spent less computational effort. This type of jet was chosen to represent the gas release in dispersion simulations.\nModelling features used at an axisymmetric jet simulation were applied in the study of a natural gas jet release. In such study the spreading angle of the jet and the velocity and concentration profiles were analysed. The findings were similar to those found in the literature for gas jet behaviour.\nThe results obtained in jet analysis have indicated that the gas behaviour near the leakage was correctly modelled. Such analysis have ensured that the preceded gas dispersion was also properly modelled and the results of the dispersion simulations in CFD were reliable.\nRegarding the ventilation rate into the module, the analysis of wind speed profile shown that at the level of the platform the wind velocity is stable so that a constant value was set for the wind speed in the dispersion simulations.\nThe influence of the wind direction in ventilation rate was also investigated. It was possible to verify that recirculation zones are formed in the deck region due the interaction between the wind and the platform structures influencing the ventilation rate into the module.\nIt was also observed that the wind direction had a little influence on ventilation rate when considering the platform geometry without the accommodation module. However, when such structure was included in platform geometry a large dead zone is formed in the deck and the ventilation rate greatly reduces (- 36%) for east wind direction. Such effect was less intense for west wind direction (10%) and almost insignificant for the other wind directions (- 5%).\nIn CFD dispersion simulations different configurations of wind and leak direction and ventilation and leak rate were considered. For each dispersion scenario a flammable gas cloud was obtained. It was observed that the largest flammable clouds were found when leak and wind had taken opposite directions. Because the wind was directed toward the leak, an effective mixture between the air and the gas released occurred giving large flammable volumes.\nFor the development of the response surface model in a first time only the leak directions x and y were considered. In these cases a second order mathematical model was used. It was possible to verify that the behaviour of the gas cloud was not the same for all angle formed between the leak and wind direction. Different response surfaces had to be used when calculating cloud sizes.\nThe division of the possible angles in quadrants seemed to be a good form to identify the different behaviours of the flammable cloud size when leak and wind take the opposite or same directions.\nThe saddle profile presented in the quadrants 2 and 3 was expected when leak and wind are in opposite direction. The behaviour found in quadrants 1 and 4 shown that the flammable cloud size increases as R increases when leak and wind take the same direction.\nA response surface was also developed to account the leak direction z and a first order\nmodel was used. It was verified that when considering the leak directions z+ and z the differences in gas dispersion and also in flammable volume are due the type of the jet that is formed: when the leak direction is z+ a upward free jet is formed, while when the leak direction is z the leakage is directed toward the ground and an impinging jet is formed. So the largest flammable clouds were found when the leak was directed toward to the deck floor (z-). Regarding the variable R, large flammable volumes were obtained for large values of R.\nSo, the fully complete model includes five response surfaces: four considering the leak directions x and y and one that accounts the leak direction z.\nThe results provided by the all response surfaces were well fitted with CFD data within a tolerance of 50%. This is considered very good agreement as far as validation of gas dispersion data was considered.\nAnother important consideration is that even the accommodation module was included in the geometry under study, the developed model was able to predict the flammable volumes with good accuracy compared with CFD simulations. Thus it can be considered a complete model for the type of geometry under study (an offshore platform).\nThe presented response surface model is a simplified prediction form and can be applied in early stages of the design when little is known about the geometry or when the geometrical model is not available. Additionally, the approach has proofed to be very robust when combined with CFD data. Through the model every possible release scenario can be assessed in a risk analysis, which is infeasible using CFD simulations.\n8.2\tFuture Work\nThe flammable gas cloud size is a function of the leak rate, which in turns depends on the leak size that originates the release. The size of the leak is a stochastic variable since there is no way to predict it beforehand. However, probabilities values are available for hole sizes. The proposed response surface model can be very useful when combining with Monte Carlo techniques. The approach will calculate probabilistic cloud sizes.\nThe response surfaces were developed based on a second order mathematical model. However, high-order models may provide a better fit with CFD results. In order to improve the\nproposed response surface model, the utilisation of other mathematical models is suggested.\nSome attempts were made to model a high aspect ratio jet behaviour, but an advanced investigation has become infeasible in this work. Thus, other studies have been developed in order to evaluate the influence of the jet orifice shape in flammable gas cloud size. By taking the same platform geometry and dispersion scenario, releases from a high aspect ratio and axisymmetric jets have been outlined and the flammable volumes have been compared. This study can provide a new method of jet modelling for gas dispersion that makes the risk analysis more realistic.\nBibliography\nANSYS CFX, INC. CFX-12.0 User's Guide, 2011.\nBBC news.

The main regions that must be defined are: the leakage, the facilities and solid structures, the computational domain contour and the wind entrance.\nBecause gas dispersion phenomenon in an offshore module is an external flow problem, a computational domain must be created to cover all geometry and region under study. It is suggested that the computational domain dimensions are 2.4 times bigger than the offshore module dimensions so that its borders do not interfere in numerical solution and a reasonable number of control volumes are obtained.\nA tetrahedral mesh can be used. According to the length scale of the geometry structures different mesh refinements are required. At the leakage region at least 10 control volumes is enough\nto capture all effects. Control volumes 2.5 times smaller than the facilities size can be used at such regions.\nA.2 CFX - Pre Processor\nIn CFX Pre Processor the mathematical model is implemented into CFD software. The properties of the fluid, the boundaries and initial conditions and the numerical scheme are specified.\nThe boundary conditions assigned to each region defined in the geometry are:\n\u2022\tLeakage - the \"Inlet\" condition is selected to indicate the entrance of a fluid flow into the computational domain. A value of mass flow or velocity can be set;\n\u2022\tWind - the \"Inlet\" condition is also selected. A velocity value or field can be set. It is also possible to set an expression to define a wind speed profile.\n\u2022\tFacilities and Solid structures - the \"Wall\" condition is selected. The no slip and free slip conditions are available.\n\u2022\tComputational Domain Contour - the \"Opening\" condition is used to indicate that there is no pressure difference between the computational domain and the outer region.\nThe natural gas composition is defined by creating a new substance. The components of this substance are selected in a material list and their mass fraction can be specified.\nA.3 CFX - Post Processor\nIn the post-processing phase the module region that is affected by the flammable cloud is verified. A plane is created above the platform deck and the natural gas molar fraction is analised.\nA volume is created based on the upper and lower flammable limits. An internal surface covers the volume where the natural gas concentration are higher than LFL while the outer surface comprises the volume where the atural gas concentration is higher than UFL.\nThe flammable cloud size could be calculated by using the function volumeInt. Such function integrates a specified variable over the volume location. The volume defined before is selected as location and the natural gas molar fraction is set as variable.\nAppendix B\nAdditional CFD Results\nSome dispersion scenarios described in Table 7.1 (Section 7.1) that given the largests flammable volumes are presented in Figures B.1 to B.12. A plane defined at 15 metres above platform deck is shown as example of the flammable region. The red zone represents the region of the gas cloud where the gas concentration exceed the UFL, while the light blue zone represents the cloud region where the gas concentration is near the LFL. So the flammable region comprises the colourful part between the red and the light blue zones.\nFigure B.2: Result of the CFD simulation considering the dispersion scenario 14 (see Table 7.1).
