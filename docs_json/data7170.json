A possible approach to perform predictive maintenance is\n\nto monitor periodically loads that act on these structures. This task can be\n\ncarried out through the Hole-Drilling Method to measure residual stresses,\n\na consolidated semi-destructive technique for both in-field and in-lab ap-\n\nplications. Standardised by ASTM E837 \u2013 13a, this method is based on a\n\nblind hole drilling that relieves local stresses; the stress relief that occurs\n\nafter material removal induces a microstructure reorganization, settling\n\nthe material in a new equilibrium state after producing strains on the hole\n\nsurrounding surface. These strains are related to the stresses that caused\n\nthem according to Hooke\u2019s law in linearly elastic isotropic materials. The\n\nmeasurement result provided by this technique is intrinsically sensitive\n\nto the drilling process and produced hole characteristics, since machining\n\ninduced residual stresses can mislead the true stress value. Besides, the\n\nhole geometry may differ significantly from the model recommended by the\n\nstandard, provoking further errors in stress calculation. This work aims to\n\ninvestigate a cutting tool and cutting parameters combination that presents\n\nthe best performance for residual stress measurements through the Hole-\n\nDrilling Method from two perspectives: machining and Electronic Speckle\n\nPattern Interferometry application to measure strains. Two square end mills\n\n(two and four flutes) with TiAlN coating were used to drill the following\n\nworkpiece materials: aluminium alloy AA 6061, carbon steel AISI 1020 and\n\nstainless steel AISI 304L. Chip and burr formation are investigated in pre-\n\nliminary analysis concerning the optical technique application since these\n\nelements can cause loss of correlation and produce unreliable data. Rota-\n\ntional speed and feed rates effects on machining induced residual stresses\n\nare analysed through analysis of variance. Chip analysis is performed to\n\nassess qualitatively plastic deformation suffered during the process. This\n\ninformation are complemented with microhardness measurements to ver-\n\n\n\nify microstructural changes caused by the drilling process. Four-flute end\n\nmill presented lower machining induced residual stress absolute values.\n\nParticularly, the cutting tool and cutting parameters combination yielded\n\nsatisfactory results when drilling AA 6061 and AISI 1020. However, AISI\n\n304L presented highly compressive machining induced residual stresses for\n\nalmost all conditions. The most influential cutting parameter on machining\n\ninduced residual stress introduction was the feed rate in the majority of the\n\ntested conditions.\n\nKeywords: Hole-Drilling Method.

Um dos pro-\n\ncedimentos usados para tal fim \u00e9 o monitoramento peri\u00f3dico dos esfor\u00e7os\n\nque atuam sobre estas estruturas; isto pode ser feito atrav\u00e9s do M\u00e9todo do\n\nFuro Cego para medi\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es residuais, uma t\u00e9cnica semi-destrutiva\n\nconsolidada tanto em aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em campo quanto em laborat\u00f3rios. Este\n\nm\u00e9todo, normatizado pela ASTM E837 \u2013 13a, consiste na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de um\n\nfuro cego, o qual alivia tens\u00f5es localizadas; o al\u00edvio proporcionado pela re-\n\nmo\u00e7\u00e3o de material provoca a reorganiza\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura, a qual se acomoda\n\nem uma nova condi\u00e7\u00e3o de equil\u00edbrio, que se expressa em deslocamentos na\n\nsuperf\u00edcie vizinha ao furo. Os deslocamentos est\u00e3o associados \u00e0s tens\u00f5es\n\nque as provocaram atrav\u00e9s de lei de Hooke em materiais isotr\u00f3picos linear-\n\nmente el\u00e1sticos. O resultado de medi\u00e7\u00e3o desta t\u00e9cnica \u00e9 intrinsicamente\n\nsuscept\u00edvel \u00e0 qualidade do processo de fura\u00e7\u00e3o e do furo produzido, pois\n\ntens\u00f5es induzidas pela usinagem podem mascarar o valor de tens\u00e3o que se\n\ndeseja conhecer, al\u00e9m de produzir caracter\u00edsticas geom\u00e9tricas que diferem\n\nsignificativamente do modelo padronizado pela norma e podem provocar\n\nerros no c\u00e1lculo das tens\u00f5es. Este trabalho visa estudar uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nde par\u00e2metros de corte e ferramenta que apresente o melhor desempenho\n\npara medi\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es residuais atrav\u00e9s do M\u00e9todo do Furo Cego tanto do\n\nponto de vista da usinagem quanto da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da Interferometria speckle\n\nna medi\u00e7\u00e3o dos deslocamentos. Duas fresas de topo reto (dois e quatro\n\ngumes) com revestimento de TiAlN foram utilizadas na fura\u00e7\u00e3o de corpos\n\nde prova dos seguintes materiais: liga de alum\u00ednio AA 6061, a\u00e7o carbono\n\nAISI 1020 e a\u00e7o inoxid\u00e1vel AISI 304L. Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de cavaco e rebarba s\u00e3o\n\navaliados em an\u00e1lise preliminar quanto \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da t\u00e9cnica \u00f3ptica para\n\nmedi\u00e7\u00e3o de deslocamentos, uma vez que podem provocar perda de corre-\n\nla\u00e7\u00e3o e inutilizar pontos de medi\u00e7\u00e3o. Os efeitos da rota\u00e7\u00e3o e da velocidade\n\n\n\nde avan\u00e7o na tens\u00e3o residual induzida pela usinagem s\u00e3o analisados atrav\u00e9s\n\nde an\u00e1lise de vari\u00e2ncia. An\u00e1lise do cavaco \u00e9 usada para avaliar qualitativa-\n\nmente a deforma\u00e7\u00e3o pl\u00e1stica sofrida durante o processo; estas informa\u00e7\u00f5es\n\ns\u00e3o complementadas com medi\u00e7\u00f5es de microdureza para verificar alter-\n\na\u00e7\u00f5es na microestrutura causadas pela fura\u00e7\u00e3o. Fresas de quatro gumes\n\napresentaram menores valores absolutos de tens\u00e3o residual induzidas pela\n\nusinagem. Em particular, a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de ferramenta e par\u00e2metros de corte\n\nmostrou-se satisfat\u00f3ria no caso do AA 6061 e AISI 1020, no entanto para\n\no AISI 304L foram encontrados valores de tens\u00e3o residual induzidas pela\n\nusinagem de car\u00e1ter bastante compressivo em quase todas as condi\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\nObservou-se que o par\u00e2metro de corte de maior influ\u00eancia na introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de\n\ntens\u00f5es residuais pela usinagem foi a velocidade de avan\u00e7o na maioria das\n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es testadas.\n\nPalavras-chave: M\u00e9todo do Furo Cego.

Uma das poss\u00edveis causas\n\nde falha \u00e9 a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es mec\u00e2nicas de opera\u00e7\u00e3o e tens\u00f5es residu-\n\nais no componente, que caso supere limites de resist\u00eancia do material pode\n\nprovocar a ruptura da pe\u00e7a. Sabe-se que o estado de tens\u00f5es residuais no\n\nmaterial pode sofrer modifica\u00e7\u00f5es ap\u00f3s a sua instala\u00e7\u00e3o, seja por condi\u00e7\u00f5es\n\nde opera\u00e7\u00e3o ou fatores externos (por exemplo, um deslizamento de terra\n\nque atinge as vizinhan\u00e7as de um duto de transporte de petr\u00f3leo). Deste\n\nmodo, monitorar as tens\u00f5es residuais que atuam na pe\u00e7a \u00e9 uma atividade\n\ncrucial para garantir a seguran\u00e7a de pessoas e do ambiente em que se in-\n\nsere, al\u00e9m de evitar interven\u00e7\u00f5es emergenciais que seriam muito custosas\n\npara a ind\u00fastria. Neste contexto, insere-se o M\u00e9todo do Furo Cego para\n\nmedi\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es residuais, que apresenta como vantagens em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a\n\noutras t\u00e9cnicas concorrentes um custo acess\u00edvel de opera\u00e7\u00e3o, possibilidade\n\nde portabilidade para inspe\u00e7\u00e3o em campo, al\u00e9m de ser um m\u00e9todo que\n\nj\u00e1 foi amplamente estudado cuja aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 consolidada tanto em ambi-\n\nentes industriais quanto em laborat\u00f3rios. Ademais, permite verificar tens\u00f5es\n\nresiduais macrosc\u00f3picas, que s\u00e3o as de maior interesses de engenharia. No\n\nentanto, o resultado de medi\u00e7\u00e3o deste m\u00e9todo \u00e9 sens\u00edvel \u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o do\n\nfuro, devido ao fato que a fura\u00e7\u00e3o sempre introduzir\u00e1 uma tens\u00e3o residual\n\noriunda da usinagem.\n\n\n\nObjetivos\n\nRecentes atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es na norma ASTM E837 \u2013 13\u00aa, que fornece\n\ninstru\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do M\u00e9todo do Furo Cego, permitiram que a\n\nfaixa de par\u00e2metros de corte fosse estendida. Este trabalho visa fornecer\n\ndados acerca de novas combina\u00e7\u00f5es de par\u00e2metros de corte (rota\u00e7\u00e3o e\n\nvelocidade de avan\u00e7o) que minimizem a tens\u00e3o residual oriunda do processo\n\nde usinagem e consequentemente diminua a invasividade do procedimento\n\nde inspe\u00e7\u00e3o, de forma que sejam fornecidos valores de tens\u00e3o medidos mais\n\npr\u00f3ximos ao valor do estado de tens\u00f5es originais em dutos de petr\u00f3leo e g\u00e1s.\n\nTais dados servir\u00e3o para melhorias no m\u00f3dulo de fura\u00e7\u00e3o do equipamento de\n\nmedi\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es residuais MTRES desenvolvido pelo LABMETRO/UFSC\nque s\u00e3o previstas para futuros desdobramentos do projeto.\n\nMetodologia\n\nMedi\u00e7\u00f5es de tens\u00e3o residual atrav\u00e9s do M\u00e9todo do Furo Cego foram\n\nexecutados usando como m\u00e1quina-ferramenta o centro de usinagem de 5\n\neixos Hermle C42U, no qual foram acoplados o electrospindle Minitor SFIDA\n\nMZ01 e o m\u00f3dulo de controle Minitor SFIDA MT01CP. Foram escolhidos os\n\nseguintes par\u00e2metros de corte: rota\u00e7\u00f5es de 25.000 e 40.000 rpm; veloci-\n\ndades de avan\u00e7o de 10 e 20 mm/min. As ferramentas de corte utilizadas\nforam fresas de topo reto revestidas com TiAlN, de dois e quatro gumes.\n\nOs materiais dos corpos de prova empregados foram materiais largamente\n\nutilizados na ind\u00fastria: a\u00e7o carbono SAE1020, a\u00e7o inoxid\u00e1vel austen\u00edtico\n\nAISI304L e liga de alum\u00ednio AA6061. Os principais atributos analisados\n\nforam a forma e dimens\u00e3o do cavaco atrav\u00e9s de microscopia eletr\u00f4nica de\n\nvarredura; medi\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es residuais induzidas pela usinagem atrav\u00e9s\n\ndo M\u00e9todo do Furo Cego aliado \u00e0 interferometria speckle; ind\u00edcios de al-\n\ntera\u00e7\u00f5es na microestrutura nas vizinhan\u00e7as do furo atrav\u00e9s de medi\u00e7\u00f5es\n\nde microdureza; finalmente, perfil do furo obtido atrav\u00e9s de microscopia\n\n\u00f3ptica. Estes atributos foram analisados para cada material e combina\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nde par\u00e2metros de corte tendo em vista uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de compromisso entre\n\nboas caracter\u00edsticas de usinagem e adequa\u00e7\u00e3o ao uso do M\u00e9todo do Furo\n\n\n\nCego com a interferometria speckle. An\u00e1lises de vari\u00e2ncia foram utilizadas\n\npara avaliar as maiores fontes de varia\u00e7\u00e3o dentre os par\u00e2metros de corte na\n\nintrodu\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00e3o residual, enquanto testes pareados de Welch foram\n\nempregados para verificar varia\u00e7\u00e3o significativa da microdureza devido ao\n\nprocesso de fura\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nResultados e Discuss\u00e3o\n\nForam observados que cavacos longos s\u00e3o bastante danosos \u00e0\n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o da t\u00e9cnica de interferometria speckle devido ao fato que propiciam\n\na raspagem da superf\u00edcie vizinha ao furo, causando a perda de correla\u00e7\u00e3o\n\ne inutilizando os dados de medi\u00e7\u00e3o. Cavacos de AISI 304L e AISI 1020\n\napresentaram uma estrutura com lamelas bem definidas, das quais pode-se\n\ndepreender que a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de corte atrav\u00e9s do deslizamento de planos de\n\ncisalhamento foi alcan\u00e7ada, sendo um indicativo de condi\u00e7\u00f5es favor\u00e1veis\n\nde corte de material. Cavacos de AA 6061 apresentaram aspecto bastante\n\nviscoso, provavelmente devido \u00e0 facilidade com a qual este material se adere\n\n\u00e0 superf\u00edcie da ferramenta de corte e dificulta sua sa\u00edda da zona de corte.\n\nVerificou-se que a ferramenta de quatro gumes produziu, em geral,\n\nmenor n\u00edvel de tens\u00f5es residuais do que a ferramenta de dois gumes, al\u00e9m\n\nde ter menor desvio padr\u00e3o da amostra. Ao menos uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de\n\npar\u00e2metros de corte produziu baixos valores absolutos de tens\u00e3o residual\n\ninduzida pela usinagem para todos os materiais, com valores m\u00e1ximos e\n\nm\u00ednimos dentro da faixa \u00b1 10 MPa. A velocidade de avan\u00e7o foi apontada\nna maior parte dos casos como o fator mais importante na introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de\n\ntens\u00f5es residuais induzidas pela usinagem. Foram detectados aumentos nos\n\nvalores de microdureza dos materiais testados na maior parte dos casos\n\nquando houve altera\u00e7\u00e3o significativa, indicando um baixo aquecimento\n\nda pe\u00e7a apesar do uso de altas rota\u00e7\u00f5es. O perfil do furo obtido com as\n\nferramentas selecionadas apresenta melhores caracter\u00edsticas para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o\n\ndo M\u00e9todo do Furo Cego do que a fresa dental atualmente empregada pelo\n\nm\u00f3dulo de fura\u00e7\u00e3o do MTRES.\n\n\n\nConclus\u00f5es\n\nResultados satisfat\u00f3rios quanto \u00e0 introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00f5es residuais\n\ninduzidas pela usinagem foram encontrados e as melhores combina\u00e7\u00f5es de\n\npar\u00e2metros de corte foram selecionados para cada material. Estes resulta-\n\ndos tamb\u00e9m se apresentaram adequados do ponto de vista da usinagem,\n\napresentando forma\u00e7\u00e3o de cavaco mais favor\u00e1vel do que processo atual em-\n\npregado pelo dispositivo de fura\u00e7\u00e3o do MTRES devido ao maior avan\u00e7o por\n\ngume, portanto com esmagamento de material e fric\u00e7\u00e3o entre ferramenta\n\nde corte e pe\u00e7a menos intensos.\n\nAdemais, m\u00faltiplos furos foram feitos com uma \u00fanica fresa de topo\n\nreto sem significativos aumentos nos n\u00edveis de tens\u00e3o residual introduzidos\n\npela usinagem para uma dada combina\u00e7\u00e3o de par\u00e2metros de corte, indi-\n\ncando que o desgaste sofrido pela ferramenta selecionada \u00e9 bem menos\n\nagressivo do que a atual fresa odontol\u00f3gica que \u00e9 descartada ap\u00f3s \u00fanico uso.\n\nAs fresas de topo reto produziram uma geometria de furo mais adequada\n\n\u00e0quela exigida pela norma, com cantos vivos e geometria mais cil\u00edndrica. Uti-\n\nlizando a configura\u00e7\u00e3o experimental deste trabalho, notou-se que a rigidez\n\ndo m\u00f3dulo de fura\u00e7\u00e3o do MTRES requer melhoras, pois exerce grande in-\n\nflu\u00eancia na

In oil and gas industry, predictive maintenance is an activity of\n\nmajor importance since great amounts of petroleum and its derivatives are\n\ndaily transported across long distances. In particular, the pipelines safety is\n\na crucial concern, as any significant harm in their integrity may lead to a\n\nleakage, having as immediate consequences valuable raw material losses,\n\ninterruption in the transport network and nearby zone contamination.\n\nIn-service pipelines are subject not merely to mechanical stresses\n\noriginated by the workload; almost always, residual stresses are also present.\n\nAs they exist in the absence of any external load, residual stresses are often\n\nneglected despite the fact that they can play an important role in the failure\n\nof mechanical structures [1]. There are four main sources of residual stresses:\nassembly process, thermal gradients, manufacture process and interactions\n\nwith the environment [2], which means that the stress state in the material\ncan change during service and should be monitored regularly in order to\n\navoid catastrophic failures.\n\nPipelines predictive maintenance calls for non-destructive or semi-\n\ndestructive techniques, i.e. those that do not harm the mechanical structure\n\nintegrity. Among them, the Hole-Drilling Method (HDM) is one of the most\n\nwidely employed techniques to evaluate residual stresses, conventionally\n\nusing strain gages for this purpose accordingly to the standard that en-\n\ndorses this testing procedure, ASTM E837 \u2013 13a: Standard Test Method\n\nfor Determining Residual Stresses by the Hole-Drilling Strain-Gage Method\n\n[3]. However, in the past few years strain gages are being successfully re-\nplaced by Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI), since the latter\n\ntechnique allows for non-contact and faster displacement measurements\n\n\n\n38 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\n[4, 5]. Figure 1.1 illustrates an in-field residual stress measurement using a\nportable interferometer.\n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 In-field measurement of combined stresses in two gas pipeline\ncross-sections [6].\n\n1.2 THE PROBLEM\n\nThe most recent version of the residual stress measurement device\n\nMTRES (Figure 1.2) developed by Laborat\u00f3rio de Metrologia e Automatiza\u00e7\u00e3o\n\n\u2013 LABMETRO/UFSC incorporates an air turbine drill, which presents the\nfollowing drawbacks: low and unstable torque, poor rotational speed control\n\nand compressed air supply dependence; rotational speed depends on the\n\nmaterial being machined and its average value is around 210,000 rpm\n\n[7]. Furthermore, MTRES employs carbide inverted-cone dental end mills\nwithout coating; these cutting tools are used to drill only a single hole to\n\nassure its quality, since the cutting tool suffers severe tool wear as reported\n\nby Bl\u00f6dorn [7].\n\nIt is worth mentioning that both the pneumatic turbine and the\n\ninverted-cone dental end mill have been recommended by the standard over\n\ndecades, however the configuration yielded by this combination may not de-\n\nliver the less disturbing drilling procedure due to the resultant unfavourable\n\nmachining conditions [7].\n\nThe current standard version released in 2013 decreased the rota-\n\ntional speed lower bound from 50,000 rpm to 20,000 rpm. Thus, better chip\n\nformation can be expected from lower rotational speeds since higher feed per\n\n\n\n1.3. Objectives 39\n\ntooth can be achieved for a given feed rate, approaching the recommended\n\ncutting parameters values accordingly to the machining theory.\n\nAnother element that can be easily improved is the cutting tool,\n\nthe inverted-cone dental end mill currently used can be substituted with a\n\nsquare end mill properly designed to metal cutting.\n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Main elements of the residual stress measurement device with\nlinear guides developed by LABMETRO/UFSC.\n\n1.3 OBJECTIVES\n\nFrom the aforementioned matters, an important modification in\n\nthe MTRES design concerns the high speed pneumatic drill replacement,\n\nwhich can be substituted with an electric drill in order to allow a better\n\nrotational speed control and higher torques. In addition, coated square end\n\nmills were selected as the cutting tools.\n\nThe main objective of this work is to test the proposed cutting\n\nparameters combinations and cutting tools to provide the best configuration\n\nfor further MTRES design improvements. This tailored configuration must be\n\na compromise solution between machining attributes and appropriateness\n\nto the ESPI utilisation requirements.\n\n\n\n40 Chapter 1. Introduction\n\nTo verify the suitability of the proposed drilling process for residual\n\nstress measurement purposes, hole drilling experiments were carried out,\n\nvarying the rotational speed, feed rate, cutting tool and workpiece material.\n\nBurr formation was also observed in a preliminary analysis to verify if their\n\nsize could compromise the measured area. Chips were qualitatively anal-\n\nysed to provide information about chip formation and plastic deformation\n\nsuffered during this process. Residual stresses introduced by the drilling\n\nprocess were measured through ESPI technique, and their effect on the\n\nsurrounding material were investigated with microhardness testing.\n\nThis work is developed within the CARD3 project (Load Evalu-\n\nation in Pipelines from Residual Stresses), a partnership between LAB-\n\nMETRO/UFSC and Petrobras.\n\n1.4 DISSERTATION STRUCTURE\n\nThis dissertation is divided in the following chapters:\n\n\u2022 Chapter 1 \u2013 Introduction: an overview of this work, explaining its\n\ncontext, problem and aims;\n\n\u2022 Chapter 2 \u2013 Residual stresses and their measurement: a background\n\nabout residual stresses and the main techniques used to evaluate\n\nthem;\n\n\u2022 Chapter 3 \u2013 Machining induced residual stresses: a brief review\n\nabout drilling process, milling cutting tools and machining induced\n\nresidual stresses in metals;\n\n\u2022 Chapter 4 \u2013 Experimental planning: a description about materials,\n\nmethods and experimental design;\n\n\u2022 Chapter 5 \u2013 Results and discussion: main outcomes from the pro-\n\nposed analyses are presented along with their discussion;\n\n\u2022 Chapter 6 \u2013 Conclusion: main findings and suggestions for future\n\nwork.\n\n\n\n41\n\n2 RESIDUAL STRESSES AND THEIR MEASUREMENT\n\nThe aim of this chapter is to present a brief overview about residual\n\nstresses and their main measurement techniques, focusing particularly on\n\nthe Hole-Drilling Method combined with Electronic Speckle Pattern Interfer-\n\nometry for strain measurement, since MTRES operating principle is based\n\non these techniques.\n\n2.1 RESIDUAL STRESSES\n\nResidual stresses correspond to the stress state found within the\n\nbulk material in the absence of an external loads and are self-equilibrating;\n\nin other words, the resultant force and moment must be zero through the\n\nwhole body [1, 2]. They are an elastic response to an incompatible local\nstrain in the structure, such as a non-uniform plastic deformation, and\n\nare created in order to preserve the dimensional continuity of the body\n\n[8]. Their importance is often overlooked because residual stresses occur\nwithout the application of any external force; depending on the operational\n\nconditions a structure is exposed to, particularly in corrosive environments\n\nand alternating service loads, such negligence can lead to the component\n\nfailure, as the residual stresses and mechanical stresses superposition can\n\nsurpass the material yield strength.\n\nResidual stresses are introduced to mechanical parts by almost all\n\nmanufacturing processes (some examples are illustrated in Figure 2.1), but\n\nthey can also be developed during the component service life. The most\n\ncommon mechanisms to produce residual stresses are non-uniform plas-\n\ntic deformations, originated from many manufacturing processes such as\n\nmachining and forming, also happen in components under operating condi-\n\ntions, such as railway rails or pipelines close to landslide locations. Another\n\nmechanism consists of material phase and/or density changes, often in the\npresence of high thermal gradients, that happen in some manufacturing\n\nprocesses such as welding, casting, quenching, nitriding, among others;\n\n\n\n42 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement\n\nduring service life, this alteration may happen as corrosion [8].\n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Examples of residual stress distributions caused by manufac-\nturing processes [8].\n\nThree main types of residual stresses can be discerned according\n\nto their extent. Residual stresses of the first type have a macroscopic nearly\n\nhomogeneous characteristic that extends over several grains of the material,\n\nand are equilibrated over the whole body. In a body that presents the\n\nfirst type residual stress, any change in the equilibrium state will affect its\n\ndimensions. Residual stresses of the second type, also known as structural\n\nmicrostresses, are nearly homogeneous across microscopic small areas of a\n\nmaterial, affecting one grain or part of grain. They are equilibrated across\n\na certain number of grains; if the equilibrium of forces and moments is\n\ndisturbed sufficiently, macroscopic changes in the dimensions of a body\n\nmay be produced. Residual stresses of the third type are inhomogeneous\n\nacross submicroscopic small areas and range over several atomic distances\n\nwithin a grain. Forces and moments are equilibrated over a small portion\n\nof the grain. Third type residual stresses do not provoke macroscopically\n\nnoticeable modifications in the body dimension [1].\n\n\n\n2.2. Residual stress measurement techniques 43\n\nResidual stresses can bring beneficial or prejudicial effects to the\n\nmaterial behaviour depending on their sign and location, impacting sig-\n\nnificantly on material strength, fatigue life and dimensional stability [8].\nCompressive residual stresses are known to have a favourable effect as they\n\nimprove fatigue life, retard crack propagation and delay stress corrosion. On\n\nthe other hand, tensile residual stresses generally have the opposite effect,\n\njeopardizing the component performance [2]. For this reason, monitoring\nperiodically the actual residual stress state in a component is vital to keep a\n\nsafe and reliable operation in many engineering applications.\n\n2.2 RESIDUAL STRESS MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES\n\nThe inherent locked-in nature of residual stresses makes their mea-\n\nsurement a challenging task. Many residual stress measurement techniques\n\nhave been developed over the years to assess residual stresses either quan-\n\ntitatively or qualitatively; they vary in equipment costs, operational costs,\n\ncomplexity, time required to acquire data and suitability for a given mea-\n\nsurement duty [9]. A comparison between many methods is provided in\nFigure 2.2 concerning to their penetration and spatial resolution. James\n\n[2] suggests that the main parameters that should be analysed to make a\nproper selection are:\n\n\u2022 nature of the material (crystallographic structure, chemical com-\n\nposition, phase, etc.);\n\n\u2022 type of residual stress (microstress or macrostress);\n\n\u2022 residual stress gradient (through the thickness of the part or only\n\nnear the surface);\n\n\u2022 geometry of the component and the zone to be studied (depth,\n\ndimension and shape of the region of interest);\n\n\u2022 where the measurement is carried out (on-site or in laboratory);\n\n\u2022 type of intervention (destructive or non-destructive);\n\n\u2022 measuring time rates;\n\n\u2022 precision and repetitiveness;\n\n\u2022 measurement cost and the price of the equipment required.\n\n\n\n44 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement\n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Penetration and spatial resolution for various residual stress\nmeasurement techniques [8].\n\nDestructive methods are based on the destruction of residual stress\n\nequilibrium state by material removal or cutting, provoking a relaxation\n\n(deformation) that is typically elastic. For this reason, a linear relationship\n\ncan be established between the released residual stress and the deformation\n\nmagnitude. The relaxation itself is not measured, but rather the conse-\n\nquences of this effect, being the strain change the most used analysed\n\nparameter. Among destructive methods, there are semi-destructive methods\n\nthat introduce little harm to the structure or component, which remains\n\nfully functional even after the intervention. The most widespread totally\n\ndestructive methods are the Sectioning Method and the Contour Method,\n\nwhile the most extensively used semi-destructive methods are Ring-Core\n\ntechnique and the Hole-Drilling Method [10]. These techniques are sensitive\nto macroscopic stresses, which are the most important residual stresses for\n\nengineering applications [2].\n\n\n\n2.2. Residual stress measurement techniques 45\n\nSectioning Method (Figure 2.3) is based on the principle that resid-\n\nual stresses are relieved by cutting the component in several strips of smaller\n\ncross sections. Heat and plasticity effects during the cutting process must\n\nbe minimal to mitigate the contamination of the original residual stress\n\nvalue. Released strains are commonly measured with mechanical or electri-\n\ncal gauges. This method is more suitable when longitudinal stresses alone\n\nare significant and allows the measurements of residual stress profiles accu-\n\nrately, being largely used to evaluate residual stresses in steel and aluminum\n\nstructural components [10, 11].\n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Sectioning method [8].\n\nThe recently developed Contour Method (Figure 2.4) is a full-field\n\ntechnique that consists of cutting through the component cross section using\n\na wire electrical discharge machining, measuring the freshly cut surface\n\nheights profile with a coordinate measuring machine or a laser profilometer.\n\nThe cut releases residual stresses that provoke deformations in the surface,\n\npulling inwards for tensile stress and bulging outwards for compressive\n\nstress. The original residual stresses normal to the cut are determined using\n\nfinite element method to calculate the stress required to flat the deformed\n\nsurface. This novel technique great advantage is the residual stress 2D map\n\ngeneration [8].\n\n\n\n46 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement\n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Contour Method [8].\n\nNon-destructive methods operating principle relies on the relation-\n\nship between physical or crystallographic parameters and residual stresses,\n\ntypically little or no material removal is necessary. However, some meth-\n\nods must need some \"stress free\" reference state and intact residual stress\n\nthat are hard to obtain with reliability. Depending on the technique, both\n\nmicroscopic and macroscopic residual stresses can be inspected. The main\n\nnon-destructive techniques are: X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, ultra-\n\nsonic and magnetic methods [2, 8]. Both magnetic and ultrasonic methods\ncan be used to measure all three types of residual stresses, however they\n\nare not able to make a clear distinction between them [2].\n\nBoth diffraction methods are based on measuring lattice strains\n\nthat arise from modifications in the polycrystalline material interplanar\n\nspacing and they can be used to study all three types of residual stresses\n\nwith high spatial resolution. While X-ray diffraction allows the residual\n\nstrains inspection on the material surface, neutron diffraction measures\n\nresidual strains within a volume of the specimen [2, 8].\n\nUltrasonic techniques use variations in the ultrasonic waves flight\n\ntime differences, and a relationship between the wave velocity in the medium\n\n\n\n2.2. Residual stress measurement techniques 47\n\nand the residual stress state can be established. However, the flight time is not\n\nonly affected by stresses, but also by other microscopic characteristics such\n\nas the grain size, presence of voids and other phases, crystallographic texture\n\nand so on. These elements decrease measured residual stress accuracy and\n\nmakes this method suitable to very specific cases. It allows the measurements\n\nin a few seconds within volumes of several cubic millimetres [2, 8].\n\nMagnetic methods take advantage of the interaction between mag-\n\nnetisation and elastic strain in ferromagnetic materials. Among magnetic\n\nmethods, the most popular uses the Magnetic Barkhausen Noise, that con-\n\nsists in the measurement of abrupt magnetic re-orientations number and\n\nmagnitude made by magnetic domains during magnetization reversal. The\n\napplication is limited to ferromagnetic materials, but measurements can\n\nbe performed in seconds with spatial resolutions smaller than a millimetre\n\n[2, 8].\n\nEven though non-destructive techniques seem to be the best option\n\nto inspect in-service components due to their non-invasive approach, they\n\noften require a delicate and expensive hardware that must be operated in\n\nlaboratory conditions, which makes them unsuitable to measure in harsh\n\nenvironments.\n\nSemi-destructive methods are a good compromise solution as they\n\navoid the component total destruction and provide information about greater\n\ndepths than non-destructive approaches. As said beforehand, the main semi-\n\ndestructive techniques are the Ring-Core Drilling and the Hole-Drilling\n\nMethod.\n\nThe Ring-Core Method consists of ring core drilling, typically 15\u2013\n\n150 mm internal diameter; the relieved strains are measured on the surface\n\ninside the ring and allow the inspection depth range between 25\u2013150% of\n\nthe internal diameter. Compared to the Hole-Drilling Method, the Ring-Core\n\nMethod presents higher sensitivity to the relieved strains and insensitivity\n\nto minor diameter errors or eccentricity at the cost of more damage and\n\ninvasiveness to the structure [12].\n\n\n\n48 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement\n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Main semi-destructive techniques: (a) Hole-Drilling Method\nand (b) Ring-Core technique [8].\n\nThe Hole-Drilling Method is probably the most well-established\n\nand largely used technique to measure residual stresses; it consists basically\n\nin the stressed material local removal by drilling a hole, typically 1-4 mm\n\ndiameter, to a depth approximately equal to its diameter, followed by the\n\nstrain relief measurement in the adjacent material. Even though the relieved\n\nstrains decay quickly with their depth from the surface, this technique\n\nallows a much more localized residual stress measurement than the Ring-\n\nCore Method [12]. Further detail about the Hole-Drilling Method follows in\nthe forthcoming topic, due to its popularity and use in the residual stress\n\nmeasurement device developed by LABMETRO/UFSC.\n\n2.3 HOLE-DRILLING METHOD\n\nThe Hole-Drilling Method is based on the pioneering work of\n\nMathar [13] and since then has become the most widespread general-\npurpose technique to measure residual stresses due to its relative simplicity,\n\nlow cost, versatility, compactness and consequent portability, being an effec-\n\n\n\n2.3. Hole-Drilling Method 49\n\ntive outside-lab solution [14]. Currently, this procedure is endorsed by the\nASTM E837 \u2013 13a [3] and can deliver quickly reliable results of uniform\nstresses in workpieces that have a thickness comparable to the tool diameter;\n\notherwise, if the workpiece thickness is much greater than the tool diameter,\n\nboth uniform stresses and non-uniform stresses can be obtained. In practice,\n\nthe method can provide satisfactory results if the residual stresses do not\n\nexceed about 80% of the material yield stress when measuring a thick work-\n\npiece, since a linear-elastic behaviour is assumpted [3]. Figure 2.6 shows a\nschematic comparison between before and after the drilling, and the effect\n\nin the surrounding material detected by the measuring technique.\n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Schematic cross-sections around a hole drilled into tensile resid-\nual stresses (a) before hole drilling and (b) after hole drilling\n[8].\n\nFor the application of the Hole-Drilling Method to determine resid-\n\nual stresses, the following assumptions are made: the material is elastic\n\nand isotropic; the measured stresses are below the elastic limit of the ma-\n\nterial; the stress normal to the surface component is negligible; in each\n\nlayer removed, the in-plane stress gradients are small; the shear forces are\n\nnegligible between layers and the hole bottom is flat [3, 15]. This method\nis constituted by three main features: drilling process, strain measurement\n\nand computational technique.\n\nConventionally, deformations are measured with strain gages, which\n\nare being replaced by full-field optical techniques [8, 9]. Optical methods\npresent features that make their application for residual stress measure-\n\nments attractive: they are non-invasive techniques and allow for full-field\n\n\n\n50 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement\n\ndata obtained at high speeds. The former feature provides a measurement\n\nthat does not cause any deformation or damage to the specimen and avoids\n\ndemanding surface preparation; the latter feature regards the great amounts\n\nof 2D data acquired at light speed that make possible complex residual stress\n\nanalyses [4, 5]. Particularly for the Hole-Drilling Method, Beghini et al. [16]\naffirms that optical methods are more adequate than the strain gage meth-\n\nods if significant plastic effects are present since the whole strain field can\n\nbe measured. The most widespread optical techniques to measure residual\n\nstresses are: ESPI, Moir\u00e9 interferometry and digital image correlation [5];\nthe first technique will be detailed, since the investigation to be developed\n\nby this work uses ESPI.\n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 Comparison between the full-field technique ESPI and strain\ngage data [8].\n\nThe ESPI technique combines speckle interferometry with elec-\n\ntronic detection and processing. The speckle effect results in a high contrast\n\nfine-scale granular pattern characterized by the random distribution of scat-\n\ntered light that arises when a rough surface is illuminated with laser light,\n\nshown by Figure 2.8. This distribution is sensitive to changes in the illumi-\n\nnation and observation geometry, rotation and diffuse surface displacement,\n\nlaser wavelength and medium refractive index. These features make speckle\n\nsuitable to measure rough surface out-of-plane and in-plane deformation\n\ncomponents, 3D shapes and surface displacements derivatives, since the\n\nrandom distribution that characterises this pattern can be deterministically\n\n\n\n2.3. Hole-Drilling Method 51\n\nchanged by displacements and rotations of the diffuse body that scatters\n\nincident light [6]. This is possible because each speckle is ideally surrounded\nby an unique combination of speckles, creating a particular signature for\n\neach measured point.\n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 Typical speckle pattern [6].\n\nESPI allows displacement, deformation and vibration measure-\n\nments typically in fraction of micrometres. This technique enable the com-\n\nparison between two non-simultaneous wave fronts generated by rough or\n\ncurved object two different states. An interferometric pattern arises from\n\nthese wave fronts interference, providing information about the change\n\n(vibration, displacement or deformation) that the object experienced, as\n\nillustrated in Figure 2.9. Figure 2.10 shows the steps to retrieve information\n\nabout the change the body suffered from this transformation recorded effect,\n\nknown as specklegram.\n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Typical ESPI interferogram of residual stress relief and conse-\nquent displacements around a drilled hole [17].\n\n\n\n52 Chapter 2. Residual stresses and their measurement\n\nFigure 2.10 \u2013 Steps to analyse ESPI interferograms [6].\n\nThis technique presents a 5\u201315% in-lab accuracy, but the test set-up\n\nneeds interferometric stability: a stiff assembly free of vibration and without\n\nsignificant thermal gradients nearby, since the interferogram is extremely\n\nsensitive to the slightest changes in its optical path [5].\n\nSince mechanical stresses are virtually impossible to be measured\n\nduring operation, their quantification is made based on the relationship\n\nbetween stresses and their consequent strains [6]. Strains arise also on the\nmaterial surface, making possible their measurement using either strain\n\ngages or optical rosettes; in the Hole-Drilling Method, these measurement\n\ntechniques are sensitive to radial displacements ur . From ur , the principal\n\nresidual stresses ?1 and ?2 and their direction ? are obtained using the nu-\n\nmerical solution developed by Makino and Nelson (1994 apud Suterio[19],\n2005) from Kirsch\u2019s analytical solution in polar coordinates:\n\nur(r,?)= A r0 a?\n? r0\n\nr\n\n?\n(?1 +?2)\n\n+ B r0 b?\n? r0\n\nr\n\n?\n(?1 ??2) cos(2? ?2?)

Hole-Drilling Method 53\n\nwhere A and B are constants related to material elastic properties, Poisson\u2019s\n\nratio ? and elasticity modulus E, given by the following equations:\n\nA=\n1 +?\n2 E\n\n(2.2)\n\nB =\n1\n\n2 E\n(2.3)\n\nin which a? and b? are dimensionless calibration constants, almost material-\n\nindependent, that correspond to the relieved strains due to unit stress within\n\nthe hole depth. These calibration constants are geometric functions obtained\n\nfrom finite element method calculations; the standard provides numerical\n\nvalues for these coefficients according to the rosette type, hole depth and\n\ndiameter [3, 20].\n\nThere are two considerations concerning the drilling process that\n\nmust be taken into account: the produced hole quality and the additional\n\nstresses that may be added by the machining process [14]. The drilled hole\nfeatures exert a strong influence on the measurement results. If the optical\n\nsystem is not orthogonal to the hole, an error of 17% may be present in the\n\nstress value result for a misalignment in the range of \u00b1 15\u00b0; furthermore,\na circularity error in the order of 2% of the diameter may cause a 4.5%\n\nerror in the obtained stress value. In addition, the stresses introduced by\n\nthe drilling process should not surpass 3% of the measured residual stress\n\n[21]. Thus, the importance of a meticulous drilling process for a successful\nresidual stress measurement is very clear; however, little attention has been\n\npaid to the hole-drilling process, in which often the cutting tool and the\n\ncutting parameters are poorly detailed.\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n3 MACHINING INDUCED RESIDUAL STRESSES\n\nIn this chapter, first a brief exposition about the drilling process\n\nand the milling cutting tools is provided to understand the particularities\n\nassociated with the procedure proposed by ASTM E837 \u2013 13a [3]. A sum-\nmary about residual stresses introduced by machining processes closes the\n\nliterature review.\n\n3.1 DRILLING\n\nDrilling is a hole-making operation in which the cutting tool with\n\nrotational motion enters the workpiece axially and cuts a hole. The hole-\n\nmaking comprises an important family of machining processes, as illustrated\n\nby Figure 3.1). Drilling operations produce about 60% of the chips and it is\n\nthe most time-consuming metal cutting operation, adding up to about 36%\n\nof all machine hours [22].\n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Examples of basic drilling operations [23].\n\n\n\n56 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses\n\n3.1.1 Drilling regime\n\nThe prime parameters that constitute the solid drilling regime\n\n(Figure 3.2) are the cutting speed and the cutting feed. In drilling, the\n\ncutting speed vc [m/min] varies along the cutting edge, since the rotating\npoint linear velocity is proportional and perpendicular to the rotation radius.\n\nThe maximum vc obtained at the tool periphery is given by Eq. 3.1,\n\nvc =\n? \u00b7 dd r \u00b7 n\n\n1000\n(3.1)\n\nwhere dd r [mm] is the drill diameter and n [rpm] is the rotational speed.\nThe depth of cut ap [mm] is half the drill diameter in solid drilling.\n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Components of solid drilling regime [24].\n\nThe cutting feed f [mm] is defined as the distance in the feed\nmotion direction at which the drilling tool advances into the workpiece per\n\nrevolution. Feed rate vf [mm/min] is calculated\n\nvf = f \u00b7 n (3.2)\n\n\n\n3.1. Drilling 57\n\nThe cut is defined by ISO 3002/3 standard as the layer of the\nworkpiece material to be removed by a single action of a cutting part. The\n\ncut parameters for one cutting tooth are the nominal thickness of cut, the\n\nnominal width of cut and the nominal cross-sectional area [24].\n\nThe nominal thickness h [mm] (also known as the uncut chip\nthickness or chip load) is one of the most important parameters in any\n\nmachining process, because it significantly influences many other features\n\nsuch as tool life, cutting forces and power, contact stresses on the tool-chip\n\ninterface, amount of plastic information of the layer being removed, among\n\nothers [25]. The parameter h is calculated as\n\nh = fz sin\n?\n?p\n\n2\n\n?\n(3.3)\n\nwhere ?p [\u00b0] is the drilling tool point angle, while the nominal width of cut\nor uncut chip width b [mm] is given by\n\nb =\nap\n\nsin(?p/2)\n(3.4)\n\nand finally, the nominal cross-sectional area or uncut chip cross-sectional\n\narea AD [mm] is obtained by\n\nAD = h \u00b7 b (3.5)\n\nFigure 3.3 shows the main forces developed during drilling. The\n\ncutting forces Fc correspond to the circumferential components that act onto\n\nthe tool rake face at the cutting edge and their direction is perpendicular to\n\nthe lips projection in the plane normal to the drill axis; they are the most\n\nimportant forces and arise from chip shearing. Thrust forces F f oppose\n\nto the tool feed and have a direction parallel to the drill axis. Finally, the\n\npassive forces Fp oppose to the tool radial motion into the workpiece and\n\nhave a direction parallel to the drill lips projections on the plane normal to\n\nthe drill axis [26, 27, 28].\n\n\n\n58 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses\n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Forces in drilling [26].\n\n3.2 MILLING\n\nMilling principally refers to a machining process performed with a\n\nrotating, multi-edge cutting tool which performs programmed feed move-\n\nments in almost all directions against a workpiece. This operation is very\n\nefficient and versatile, allowing the production of prismatic, polyhedrical or\n\nfree-form shapes, as shown in Figure 3.4; in addition, it is an alternative to\n\nproduce holes, threads, cavities and surfaces that are traditionally obtained\n\nby turning, drilling or tapping [22, 29].\n\nThe intermittent action of each cutting edge during material re-\n\nmoval is an important aspect inherent to all milling operations; each tooth\n\nundergoes periodical impacts and thermal cycling due to the interrupted\n\nnature of the cut. Each cutting edge cuts during less than half of a revolu-\n\ntion of the tool, often only in very small fractions of the cycle, producing in\n\ngeneral small chips [22, 26, 28].\n\n\n\n3.2. Milling 59\n\nThread milling Slot milling Shoulder milling\n\nProfile millingFace milling\n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Examples of milling operations [29].\n\nOften, a distinction is made based on the milling direction. If the\n\nworkpiece feed direction is the same as that of the cutter rotation at the\n\narea of cut, up-milling is being performed (Figure 3.5b); the milling cutter\n\nenters the workpiece at null theoretical undeformed chip thickness, which\n\nincreases until the end of the cut. In this case, rubbing and burnishing effects\n\nwith friction, high temperatures and work-hardened surfaces are present.\n\nOtherwise, when the feed direction of the workpiece is opposite to that of\n\nthe cutter rotation at the area of cut, the operation is called down-milling\n\n(Figure 3.5a); the milling cutter enters the workpiece at the maximum\n\nundeformed chip thickness and it will decrease to zero until the end of the\n\ncut. The large chip thickness helps to keep lower burnishing effects, with\n\nless heat and work-hardening [26, 29].\n\n\n\n60 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses\n\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 Milling direction: (a) down-milling and (b) up-milling [30].\n\n3.2.1 Milling cutting tools\n\nMany different shapes of milling cutting tools are available for\n\ndifferent uses. The most popular are, by far, end mills and milling cutters,\n\nshown in Figure 3.6. While milling cutters are often developed for a specific\n\npurpose, end mills are versatile cutting tools that can be used for a variety\n\nof applications (face milling, shoulder milling, slot milling, plunge milling,\n\nprofile milling, chamfering, threading and drilling, among others) due to\n\nthe wide range of diametrical sizes and design characteristics [29]. The\nmain geometrical parameters of an end mill are illustrated in Figure 3.7.\n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Most common milling cutting tools: (a) Milling cutters and (b)\nend mills [29].\n\nThe number of flutes is a significant parameter that should be taken\n\ninto account when selecting an end mill; two to four flutes end mills are the\n\n\n\n3.2.

Machining induced residual stresses\n\nmost common types for small diameter tools, whereas larger diameter tools\n\nmay have six, eight or more flutes. The fewer the flutes, the more material\n\nis removed with each tool rotations, making rougher cuts with greater chip\n\nloads that prevent heat from building up. More flutes favours the creation\n\nof smoother surface finish. Increasing the flute number improves flexural\n\nrigidity due to higher cross-section area, but on the other hand decreases\n\nthe space for chip ejection [31, 32]. The number of flutes is related to an\nimportant parameter, the feed per tooth fz [mm], defined as\n\nfz =\nvf\n\nzc \u00b7 n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere zc is the number of teeth in the cutter, which is equal to the number\n\nof flutes in an end mill.\n\nAmong the geometric parameters (Figure 3.8), the most important\n\nconcerning machining induced residual stresses are clearance angle, rake\n\nangle and tool edge radius. The clearance angle ? is the angle between the\n\nworkpiece surface and the tool flank, responsible for diminishing the friction\n\nbetween these elements. If clearance angle is too small, the wedge does\n\nnot penetrate in the workpiece and the wear is intensified, making the tool\n\nblunt precociously. If the clearance angle is too large, the tool mechanical\n\nresistance is reduced and it may chip easily [23, 33].\n\nThe rake angle ? can be positive, null or negative, being the main\n\nresponsible for the metal cutting. The wedge stability strongly depends\n\non the rake angle magnitude. When the rake angle is very positive, lower\n\ncutting and feed forces are required to produce chips, also better surface\n\nfinishing is achieved; however, it tends to produce a continuous chip and\n\nthe wedge becomes too fragile and susceptible to break. Negative rake angle\n\nfavours tool stability, but plastic deformation is increased, demanding higher\n\ncutting forces and exposing the wedge to severe thermal loads [23, 33].\n\n\n\n3.2. Milling 63\n\nFigure 3.8 \u2013 Chip formation and tool geometric parameters [34].\n\nThe cutting edge radius ? (Figure 3.9) influences the separation\n\nof the total uncut chip thickness h into two components, the actual uncut\n\nchip thickness ta and the crushed layer thickness h1 caused by the round\n\npart adjacent to the tool flank. When h/? ? 10, the cutting tool can be\nconsidered perfectly sharp; otherwise, the material is significantly burnished\n\nby the tool and the cutting edge radius influences must be taken into account\n\n[33].\n\nFigure 3.9 \u2013 Cutting edge radius and chip thickness [33].\n\n\n\n64 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses\n\n3.3 CHIP FORMATION\n\nDuring cutting processes, the chip formation consists of the cutting\n\nedge penetration into the workpiece material, which suffers elastic and\n\nplastic deformation until the maximum permissible material shear stress\n\nis reached and the material begins to flow, forming a chip; it is worth\n\nmentioning that the chip formation will take place if the minimum chip\n\nthickness hm is surpassed [23].\n\nA schematic representation of the chip formation (continuous chip,\n\nfor the sake of didactics) is shown in Figure 3.10 in which four zones\n\nconstitute a continuous plastic deformation. Simple shear provokes the\n\ntransition from the workpiece structure (a) to the chip structure (b). Small\n\ndeformations on the shear plane are able to produce material detachment\n\nduring machining of brittle materials, whereas in a material with higher\n\ndeformability the detachment begins in the front of the cutting edge in zone\n\n(e). Great amounts of deformation in the surroundings of the rake face (c)\n\nand the cut surface (d) arise from the combined action of tensile stresses,\n\nperpendicular active pressure and high temperatures in the detachment\n\nzone.\n\nFigure 3.10 \u2013 Chip initiation [23].\n\n\n\n3.3. Chip Formation 65\n\nDepending on the stress direction and magnitude, the material\n\nbehaviour can be either tough or brittle; hence, chip formation mechanism\n\nis strongly influenced by these variables. The stress direction is defined\n\nby the tool normal rake angle, tool cutting edge angle and tool cutting\n\nedge inclination, while the magnitude of a stress is affected by the cutting\n\nspeed, feed rate and depth of cut [23, 35]. Interactions between factors that\ninfluences chip formation are summarised in Figure 3.11.\n\nFigure 3.11 \u2013 Influences during chip formation [23].\n\nThe chip formation mechanisms that arise from this set of elements\n\nare illustrated in Figure 3.12. Continuous chip formation occurs when an\n\nevenly deformed material slides off along the rake face in temporally highly\n\nuniform friction conditions (constant speed in a stationary flow) between the\n\nchip and the tool, as a consequence of positive rake angles, low undeformed\n\nchip thickness and an uniform, high ductility workpiece material [23, 35].\n\nLamellar chip formation is a continuous, periodic mechanism char-\n\nacterized by an unevenly material deformation, in which the lamellae arise\n\nfrom thermal or elastomechanical processes with a high formation fre-\n\nquency in the kHz range that results in cleavages or concentrated shear\n\n\n\n66 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses\n\nbands. Lamellar chips are often produced from highly ductile workpiece\n\nmaterials with an increased strength, in particular at high cutting speeds\n\n[23, 35].\n\nSegmented chip formation is a discontinuous mechanism that\n\npresents slightly connected elements that are separated in the shear plane\n\nand fused immediately after; chip segments are characterized by signifi-\n\ncant differences in the degree of deformation, occurring mostly by the use\n\nof negative rake angles, lower cutting speeds and higher chip thickness\n\n[23, 35].\n\nDiscontinuous chip formation occurs in materials with very brit-\n\ntle properties or when predefined slide paths are present due to profuse\n\ninhomogeneities; bits of the workpiece material are ripped up from the\n\nbulk without significant deformation, consequently the freshly machined\n\nworkpiece surface is a result of these small breakages [23, 35].\n\nFigure 3.12 \u2013 Chip formation mechanisms [35].\n\n\n\n3.4. Size effect 67\n\n3.4 SIZE EFFECT\n\nSize effect occurs when the cutting edge radius becomes compara-\n\nble to the cutting thickness. With this configuration, cutting happens with a\n\nhighly negative rake angle and the proportion between the cutting thick-\n\nness and cutting edge radius determines the chip formation mechanism, as\n\nshown by Figure 3.13. Chip will not be formed if the cutting thickness is\n\nsmaller than the minimum chip thickness; in this circumstance, the mate-\n\nrial undergoes an elastic-plastic deformation known as ploughing, without\n\nforming chips effectively. As the cutting thickness approaches and surpasses\n\nthe minimum chip thickness, ploughing decreases and chips are efficiently\n\nproduced [36, 37, 38, 39].\n\nFigure 3.13 \u2013 Effect of the proportion between minimum chip thickness\n[38].\n\nThe dramatic increase in specific cutting force during machining\n\nwith small cutting thickness happens due to the increasing specific shear\n\nenergy caused by ploughing and actual chip thickness accumulation, that\n\nkeeps building up until the material removal can take place [40].\n\nOliveira et al. [41] suggest that any minimum chip thickness can be\nwithin 1/4 and 1/3 of the cutting edge radius, regardless of the workpiece\nmaterial. In processes dominated by size effect, chip formation with intermit-\n\ntent nature may arise from the several revolutions made by the cutting tool\n\nwithout properly forming a chip, which may overload tool bearings or bend\n\nand even break the cutting tool [42, 43]. Determination of micromilling\ncutting parameters cannot be based on conventional milling information\n\nsince size effect takes place concomitantly to the micro end mill low strength\n\n[36].\n\n\n\n68 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses\n\n3.5 MACHINING INDUCED RESIDUAL STRESSES\n\nDuring metallic materials chip-forming machining process, elastic\n\nand plastic deformations, lattice imperfection variations and heat produc-\n\ntion occurs near the workpiece surface [44]. A large amount of the power\nconsumption is converted into heat in the cutting edge surroundings due to\n\nfrictional effects in the interface tool-workpiece and the plastic deformation\n\nof material being removed [45].\n\nResidual stresses are always originated from ihnomogeneous plastic\n\ndeformations and/or phase transformations associated to volume changes.\nPlastic deformations due to forces perpendicular and parallel to the work-\n\npiece surface favours the production of compressive residual stresses, while\n\nplastic deformations due to local heating tends to generate tensile resid-\n\nual stresses; phase transformations can lead to the development of both\n\ncompressive and tensile residual stresses depending on the volume changes\n\nand plastic deformations associated with [44]. Figure 3.14 explains the\nformation of thermally and mechanically induced residual stresses, while\n\nFigure 3.15 focuses on the chip-forming relationship with residual stresses.\n\nFigure 3.14 \u2013 Residual stress formation mechanisms [23].\n\nHeat generation influences strongly the cutting tool performance\n\n\n\n3.5. Machining induced residual stresses 69\n\nand is, concomitantly, a consequence of its characteristics. Furthermore, it\n\naffects strongly the freshly cut work surface quality, the material proper-\n\nties and the residual stress state due to the severe temperature gradients\n\ndeveloped during the metal cutting [46]. On the other hand, the heat gen-\nerated can be beneficial since it decreases the shear stress, facilitating the\n\nchip formation and decreasing the plastic deformation in the workpiece.\n\nIndeed, Sadat [47] showed that extension of the residual stresses beneath\nthe machined surface increases as the cutting speed decreases, which can\n\nbe explained by lower temperatures for lower cutting speeds.\n\nFigure 3.15 \u2013 Classification of processes producing residual stresses during\nchip-forming machining operations [44].\n\nBrinksmeier et al. [48] presented a vast compilation comprising\nresidual stresses measurement and causes in many machining processes.\n\nParticularly in milling, compressive residual stresses are found due to the\n\nconsiderable plastic deformation associated with this process; furthermore,\n\nhigher feed rates and rotational speeds increase compressive stresses and\n\ntheir penetration depth, which is also favoured by tool wear. Tool sharpness\n\nstrong influence in residual stress introduction was also noticed by Jang\n\net al. [49] in a study that analysed surface residual stresses through X-ray\ndiffraction in austenitic stainless steel turning and found mostly compressive\n\nstresses. El-Khabeery and Fattouh [50] studied residual stresses caused by\n\n\n\n70 Chapter 3. Machining induced residual stresses\n\nmilling and concluded that residual stress reached highest values with\n\nincreasing feed rate, depth of cut and material resistance.\n\nParticularly in the case of the hole drilling process for residual\n\nstress measurement purposes, Flaman [51] compared the low-speed end\nmill to the high-speed drill; it was observed that the high-speed-drilled hole,\n\nwhen compared to the hole obtained by the low-speed end mill, presented\n\na much smoother and straighter sides (Figure 3.16), a much flatter and less\n\nrounded bottom; in addition, the first technique resulted in smaller and\n\nmore equi-dimensional chip. In short, the high-speed drill provided a hole\n\nwith better characteristics to be used to measure residual stresses.\n\nLater, Flaman and Herring (1985 apud Grant et al.[14], 2006)\nstudied four drilling techniques, comparing induced stresses, hole geometry\n\nand controllability, portability and ease of use. The author concluded that\n\nthe drilling with low-speed modified end mill was the only inadequate\n\ntechnique as high stresses were produced; the drilling with high-speed drill\n\nwas suitable for most materials, except extremely hard ones.\n\nFigure 3.16 \u2013 Comparison of the low-speed end mill and the high-speed\ndrill [51].\n\nRecently, Steinzig et al. [53] tested the Hole-Drilling Method us-\ning a two-flute end mill with 1.59 mm diameter, 3 mm/min feed rate and\nrotational speeds within the range between 2,000 and 40,000 rpm. They\n\nobserved that chattering possibly caused inadequate holes when using rota-\n\ntional speed below 10,000 rpm and above this limit repeatable residual stress\n\n\n\n3.5. Machining induced residual stresses 71\n\nmeasurements could be carried out, indicating that high-speed commonly\n\nadvised by the standard may not be necessarily required.\n\n\n\n\n\n73\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL PLANNING\n\nThis chapter details the experimental planning used to achieve\n\nthe aims of this investigation. An explanation on the standardised drilling\n\nprocess idiosyncrasies opens the chapter to provide understanding about\n\nthe choices that culminated in the final experimental design, followed by\n\na description about the materials and methods used in this study. Further\n\ninformation in provided in an organic fashion to furnish understanding\n\nabout the chain of decisions taken during this work development.\n\n4.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE DRILLING PROBLEM\n\nThe drilling process recommended by ASTM E837 \u2013 13a [3] should\nbe performed with an carbide inverted-cone dental burr or small carbide\n\nend mill; in other words, this machining process is a boring operation\n\nwith drilling dynamics acting on a milling cutting tool. Besides, rotational\n\nspeeds must be in the range within 20,000 rpm and 400,000 rpm due\n\nto the historical use of high-speed pneumatic turbines by many research\n\ngroups and companies to measure residual stresses through the Hole-Drilling\n\nMethod. Despite its widespread utilisation, these rotational speeds are often\n\nmuch higher than the recommended values for this cutting tool material and\n\ndiameter [3, 54, 55]. Concerning the pneumatic turbine, another relevant\naspect is the air compressibility that restrains feed rates to very low values\n\nto avoid stalling and unacceptable run-outs. Extremely low feed rates and\n\nexcessively high rotational speeds combination results in an unfavourable\n\nchip formation, the minimum chip thickness is barely reached and the\n\nprocess is dominated by burnishing instead of cutting due to ploughing\n\neffects [42].\n\nConcerning the ESPI use to measure strains from which residual\n\nstress are calculated, an essential requirement is to free the reference surface\n\nfrom any foreign body between measurement steps, including moisture,\n\nchips, burrs, among others. This precaution is taken because these undesired\n\n\n\n74 Chapter 4. Experimental planning\n\nelements will provoke a change in the acquired image that is not related to\n\nstrain, leading to spurious data. For this reason, dry machining is obligatory.\n\nSummarising briefly given the problem constraints, dry drilling is\n\nperformed with an end mill, using very high rotational speeds and fairly\n\nlow feed rates.\n\n4.2 DRILLING TEST STAGES\n\nTwo drilling test stages were performed: screening tests and final\n\ntests. Screening tests were drilling operations performed using two and four-\n\nflute square end mills in the most difficult-to-machine workpiece among\n\nthe preselected materials to check technical viability and to reduce the\n\nexperimental matrix to the most suitable cutting parameters combinations\n\nconcerning machining aspects and how they relate to the Hole-Drilling\n\nMethod alongside ESPI application. Residual stress measurements were not\n\nperformed at this stage. From three rotational speeds and three feed rates,\n\nthis test outputs are the two best rotational speed and two best feed rates\n\nto be used in the next stage. During this first analysis, particular attention\n\nwas paid to the following aspects:\n\n\u2022 the resulting burr around the hole that may act as a noise source\n\nin the phase map depending on its extent;\n\n\u2022 the chip formation, that provide information about the plastic de-\n\nformation the material is suffering, and consequently a qualitative\n\nevidence about the residual stresses being introduced into the\n\nworkpiece;\n\n\u2022 the chip form, since long and continuous chip may scratch the\n\nmeasuring surface during the cutting tool rotation.\n\nDuring the second stage in which the final tests were carried out,\n\nresidual stress measurements through the Hole-Drilling Method were per-\n\nformed in three types of workpieces using the four cutting parameters\n\ncombination using two and four-flute square end mills. Further detail about\n\nthe cutting tools, workpiece and cutting parameters are provided in the next\n\n\n\n4.3. Workpieces 75\n\nsections.\n\n4.3 WORKPIECES\n\nThree different types of workpieces were used, which are materials\n\ncommonly used in the industry: AISI 304L austenitic stainless steel, AISI\n\n1020 carbon steel and AA 6061 aluminium alloy. These materials were\n\nacquired as flat sheets with 6.35 mm, 6.30 mm and 12.00 mm respectively\n\nand their relevant physical properties are shown in Table 4.1.\n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Workpieces physical properties [56].\n\nProperty AISI\n1020\n\nAISI\n304L\n\nAA\n6061-O\n\nDensity [kg m?3] 7850 8000 2700\n\nElastic modulus [GPa] 207 193 69\n\nPoisson\u2019s ratio [-] 0.30 0.30 0.33\n\nTensile yield strength [MPa] 210 205 55\n\nTensile ultimate strength [MPa] 380 515 125\n\nVickers hardness [HV] 162 191 50\n\nThermal conductivity [W m?1 K?1] 51.9 16.2 180\n\nThermal expansion coefficient [\u00d710?6 K?1] 11.7 17.2 23.0\nThermal diffusivity [\u00d710?6 m2 s?1] 13.6 4.1 137.2\n\nThe above-mentioned dimensions correspond to the case in which\n\nthe hole depth is much smaller when compared to the specimen thickness,\n\nbeing denominated as thick workpieces by ASTM E837 \u2013 13a [3]. The stan-\ndard recommends that the minimum thickness should be 5.13 mm for a hole\n\ndiameter between 1.52 and 2.54 mm to measure uniform stresses in these\n\nsituations. These sheets were cut into 135 mm strips using plasma cutting;\n\nafterwards, these strips were divided equally into 25 mm wide pieces using\n\na band saw. After the cutting process, these 25 mm wide and 135 mm long\n\nspecimens have undergone a heat treatment to relieve stresses from the\n\nprevious manufacturing processes in order to assess only the influence from\n\nmachining induced residual stress introduced by the hole drilling. Heat\n\n\n\n76 Chapter 4. Experimental planning\n\ntreatment certificates can be found in Annex A. The preparation was con-\n\ncluded by spraying the workpieces with a thin white paint layer to produce\n\na matte finish, since a non-reflective surface is desirable in ESPI technique\n\napplication. In Figure 4.1, workpieces ready to be drilled are shown.\n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Workpieces after preparation [7].\n\nAustenitic stainless steels, such as AISI 304L, are considered difficult-\n\nto-machine materials due to their work-hardening tendencies, high tensile\n\nstrength, high ductility combined with poor thermal conductivity. High\n\ncutting forces are developed during the machining process, accompanied\n\nby intense heat generation around the cutting edge [57, 58]. In particular,\nthe combination of high strength and high ductility makes chip breaking a\n\ndifficult task, propitiating tool vibration that may cause a severe harm to\n\nthe cutting tool [59].\n\nAISI 1020 is a plain low-carbon steel that consists principally in\n\nferrite, having small amounts of pearlite. Low-carbon steels undergo rapid\n\nwork-hardening, especially when clean [58]. Ferrite is easily cut and has\nlittle contribution to tool wear, but favours built-up edge formation and poor\n\nfinishing. The main responsibles for tool wear when machining AISI 1020\n\nare pearlite and oxide particles, that have higher hardness and can be very\n\nabbrasive to the cutting tool. Nonetheless, plain carbon steels are almost\n\nalways easily machined than alloys steels of comparable carbon content and\n\nhardness [60], having also a thermal conductivity three times higher than\n\n\n\n4.4. Cutting parameters selection 77\n\nthe AISI 304L that removes heat from the cutting zone more efficiently.\n\nAA 6061 is magnesium-silicon aluminium alloy with excellent cor-\n\nrosion resistance that can be machined to a good finish in the cutting fluid\n\nabsence and are more machinable in the heat-treated tempers than in softer\n\nannealed solutions, which are more prone to the built-up edge formation\n\nbecause of melting from heat generation. High cutting speed has a benefi-\n\ncial effect keeping the workpiece cool, as most of the heat generated in a\n\ngiven rotation is removed with the freshly cut chip during the subsequent\n\nrotation. Short diffusion times given by the aluminium alloy high thermal\n\nconductivity also helps to dissipate heat from the cutting area [60].\n\n4.4 CUTTING PARAMETERS SELECTION\n\nCutting parameters were selected having the following premises:\n\n\u2022 take advantage of the decrease in the rotational speed allowed by\n\nthe last standard version, from 50,000 to 20,000 rpm;\n\n\u2022 propose an evolution from the former MTRES process (0.1\u20130.2\n\nmm/min feed rates and approximately 210,000 rpm rotational\nspeed), presenting lower rotational speeds, higher and yet moder-\n\nate feed rates to favour proper chip formation;\n\n\u2022 choose rotational speeds within the operating range offered by\n\nbrushless motors without auxiliary fluid-based cooling subsystem,\n\nas they constitute the most likely replacement for the pneumatic\n\nturbine, considering that most devices reach 60,000 rpm and higher\n\nrotational speeds are associated with decreasing torque.\n\nTherefore, the following rotational speeds were chosen to per-\n\nform screening tests: 10,000, 25,000 and 40,000 rpm. Even though 10,000\n\nrpm is out of bounds, in a preliminary test it will be used to dig for any\n\nimprovements in association with the selected feed rates.\n\nThe selected feed rates were 1, 10 and 20 mm/min. The lower\nfeed rate, 1 mm/min, was chosen as an intermediary solution between the\ncurrent MTRES and the higher feed rates, which are two order of magnitudes\n\n\n\n78 Chapter 4. Experimental planning\n\ngreater than those reached currently by the equipment.\n\n4.5 CUTTING TOOL SELECTION\n\nA major concern in the tool selection is the tool geometry, since\n\ngeometrical characteristics impact directly on machining performance: chip\n\nflow, breakage and direction; cutting force components direction and mag-\n\nnitude; machining productivity; tool life; sliding velocity at the tool-chip\n\ninterface; thermal energy and cutting edge temperature distributions; ma-\n\nchining quality (surface integrity and machining induced residual stress),\n\nand so forth [61, 62].\n\nThere are two types of cutting tools allowed by ASTM E837 \u2013 13a:\n\ncarbide inverted-cone dental burrs or small carbide end mills, aiming to\n\nproduce a hole with cylindrical shape and flat bottom [3]. Since inverted-\ncone dental burrs are designed to machine teeth, their performance may be\n\nfar from optimal during metal cutting.\n\nAnother feature that could be improved is to use a coated cutting\n\ntool. Coatings are used in the machining industry is to improve the tribo-\n\nlogical condition at the cutting tool-chip and the cutting tool-workpiece\n\ninterfaces [25]. Choosing the right coating helps to minimize adhesion and\nfriction effects, and the thermal load in the tool is reduced by the small\n\nheat penetration [63]. The use of coatings broadened the dry machining\noperations range, enabled the use of higher rotational speeds and feed\n\nrates, enhanced performance in high temperature environments such as\n\nabrasive and difficult to machine materials [63, 64]. A comparison between\ncoatings used in cutting tools are provided in Table 4.2. Recapitulating\n\nthat dry machining is a requirement imposed by ESPI technique and high\n\nrotational speeds are demanded by ASTM E837 \u2013 13a [3], choosing TiAlN\nthat presents high oxidation temperatures seems a reasonable decision.\n\nTaking into account the previous considerations, square end mills\n\nwith a 1.5 mm diameter were chosen. Two tools were selected: two-flute\n\nand four-flute tungsten carbide square end mills, coated with TiAlN, which\n\n\n\n4.5.

The spindle motor maximum rotational\n\nspeed is 18,000 rpm and the maximum feed rate is 60 m/min. Since the\nminimum rotational speed allowed by the current standardised method\n\nsurpasses the machine tool maximum rotational speed, a Minitor SFIDA\n\nMZ01 electrospindle that reaches 60,000 rpm was coupled to the system,\n\naccompanied by the control pack Minitor SFIDA MT01CP.\n\n\n\n4.6. Drilling experimental setup and procedure 81\n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Machine tool overview.\n\n4.6.1 First stage\n\nDuring the first stage, dry drilling was performed without mea-\n\nsuring residual stresses and MTRES was not used. Nonetheless, drilling\n\noperations were divided in ten increments, simulating the procedure to be\n\nused at the second stage. Naturally, AISI 304L stainless steel was the chosen\n\nmaterial to perform screening tests due to the challenges its mechanical and\n\nthermal properties pose to machining, using the worst case scenario to verify\n\nthe coupling between machine tool dynamics and cutting tool when drilling\n\n\n\n82 Chapter 4. Experimental planning\n\nthe chosen cutting parameters. Another feature that was being tested is\n\nwhether the end mills would be capable of drilling multiple holes without\n\nbeing severely worn to a prohibitive level culminating in tool breakage as\n\nobserved in the dental end mills currently used by MTRES [42].\n\nWorkpieces were fastened directly on the machining centre table\n\nusing strap clamps. Two new cutting tools were used, a four-flute square\n\nend mill and a two-flute square end mill. Each cutting tool was used to test\n\nall cutting parameters combinations shown in Table 4.5.\n\nTable 4.5 \u2013 Tested cutting parameters during first stage.\n\nCutting parameters\n\n10,000 rpm\n1 mm/min\n\n10,000 rpm\n10 mm/min\n\n10,000 rpm\n20 mm/min\n\n25,000 rpm\n1 mm/min\n\n25,000 rpm\n10 mm/min\n\n25,000 rpm\n20 mm/min\n\n40,000 rpm\n1 mm/min\n\n40,000 rpm\n10 mm/min\n\n40,000 rpm\n20 mm/min\n\nEach cutting tool was used to perform a single repetition for each\n\ncutting parameters combination, totalising nine drilling operations for each\n\nend mill. Holes were drilled in a row according to the longitudinal work-\n\npiece direction, with a 10 mm distance between hole centres to prevent\n\nany influences from the previous and next drilling sites. This experiment\n\nworkflow is given by 4.4.\n\n\n\n4.6.

To measure stresses, MTRES was\n\nemployed. This device is composed by two independent subsystems: the\n\ndrilling module and the measurement module. The drilling module was\n\ndisassembled from the equipment, freeing the diameter socket in which this\n\nsubsystem is fixed (dimensions in Annex C). This way, the set composed by\n\ncutting tool and electrospindle shank MZ01 \u2013 SK40 was able to dive into\n\n\n\n84 Chapter 4. Experimental planning\n\nthe socket and drill the hole without colliding against the device, since a\n\nclearance annulus having a 6 mm maximum distance between those parts\n\nwas possible given the electrospindle characteristics as specified in Annex\n\nB. A schematic MTRES in-scale view and electrospindle positions during\n\nmeasuring and drilling is provided in Figure 4.5.\n\nFigure 4.5 \u2013 Drilling and measuring positions.\n\nAfter positioning MTRES on the machine tool table and adjusting a\n\nproper height, i.e. aligning the interferometer arms to have the same length,\n\na probe coordinate measurement was conducted to reference the socket\n\ncylindrical surface. This referencing procedure was also performed on the\n\nworkpieces upper surface to find a plane that describes their heights to drill\n\nthe first step correct depth.\n\nWorkpieces were fixed as in the previous stage using strap clamps,\n\nwhich were bolted as far as possible from the drilling points with the mini-\n\nmum required torque to keep the specimen in place without introducing\n\nundesired stresses into it. The workpiece lateral surface was propped against\n\n\n\n4.6. Drilling experimental setup and procedure 85\n\na flat metal strip along which the specimen could slide forward to the next\n\ndrilling position, which preserved the same 10 mm spacing as the one used\n\nin the previous stage. The metal strip was aligned perpendicularly to MTRES\n\nlinear guides using a set-square, yielding the disposition shown in Figure\n\n4.6.\n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Drilling experiments key elements mounted on the machine\ntool table.\n\nEach end mill was assigned to only one material and all the cutting\n\nparameters according to the sequence shown in Table 4.6 were tested using\n\na single tool for all repetitions; test short nomenclatures are provided since\n\nthey were used to make clean plots in the next chapter. This sequence was\n\nchosen based on the conventional machining knowledge that lower feed\n\nrates are less aggressive than higher ones, since the most favourable chips\n\nchosen in the previous stage seemed to be satisfactorily formed at least for\n\nAISI 304L. However, clear distinction between chip formation regime due to\n\nsize effect was not easily discerned since there was evidence of a transition\n\n\n\n86 Chapter 4. Experimental planning\n\nbetween these two regimes during the preliminary tests.\n\nSince the tool edge radius (9.3<?<17.7 \u00b5m) was much greater\nthan the feed per tooth (0.06<fz<0.40 \u00b5m), during the planned tests\nthe cutting edge would not experience the transition from sharp to blunt\n\ncondition, otherwise it would modify significantly the metal cutting regime.\n\nFurthermore, drilling several holes with a single end mill and verifying that\n\nthe machining induced residual stresses were kept at satisfactory levels also\n\nrepresent an improvement from the current MTRES state, as each dental\n\nend mill is discarded after drilling only a single hole [7]. Three repetitions\nwere planned for all materials in each cutting parameters combination, but\n\ndue to tool breakage in the beginning of the final tests during AISI 304L\n\ndrilling only two repetitions were made for this material. Three repetitions\n\ncould be made during AISI 1020 and AA 6061 machining without replacing\n\nthe cutting tool.\n\nTable 4.6 \u2013 Tested cutting parameters during second stage.\nCutting\n\nparameters\ncombination\n\nShort nomenclature Feed per tooth\n\n25,000 rpm\n10 mm/min\n\na: two-flute end mill\nA: four-flute end mill\n\nfz,a : 0.20 \u00b5m\nfz,A: 0.10 \u00b5m\n\n40,000 rpm\n10 mm/min\n\nb: two-flute end mill\nB: four-flute end mill\n\nfz,b : 0.13 \u00b5m\nfz,B : 0.06 \u00b5m\n\n25,000 rpm\n20 mm/min\n\nc: two-flute end mill\nC: four-flute end mill\n\nfz,c : 0.40 \u00b5m\nfz,C : 0.20 \u00b5m\n\n40,000 rpm\n20 mm/min\n\nd: two-flute end mill\nD: four-flute end mill\n\nfz,d : 0.25 \u00b5m\nfz,D : 0.13 \u00b5m\n\nAnother care taken during the experiments concerned the reference\n\nsurface cleaning: dessicated compressed air was blown remove metal chips\n\nfrom the measuring area without contact after each drilling step prior to\n\nthe image acquisition.

Experimental planning\n\n4.7 TECHNIQUES AND ANALYSES\n\nThe forthcoming topics consist of information about the techniques\n\nemployed and the analyses that were derived from them during the devel-\n\nopment of this work; the relationships between the experiments inputs and\n\noutputs, techniques and their respective analyses are synthesized in Figure\n\n4.8.\n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Overview of analyses and techniques used in this work.\n\n4.7.1 Analysis from the Hole-Drilling Method\n\nIn this work, uniform residual stresses evaluation were performed\n\nusing the Hole-Drilling Method as aforementioned. For this purpose, MTRES\n\nmeasurement module, which is a double-illumination ESPI system to mea-\n\nsure pure radial in-plane displacement fields that makes use of an axis-\n\nsymmetrical binary diffractive optical element (DOE) as a beam-splitting\n\ngrating (Figure 4.9). Further information about this system can be found in\n\n[6, 65].\n\nThe assumption of an uniform stress field is based on the fact that\n\nthe workpieces have undergone a heat treatment to relieve prior manufac-\n\nturing residual stresses before the hole drilling experiments. In addition,\n\nuniform stress calculation can be done to find the representative size of a\n\nresidual stress field, being an average within the hole depth, weighted in\n\nfavour of the stresses that act near the measured surface [3]. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n4.7. Techniques and analyses 89\n\nuniform stress assumption to assess the drilling process overall effect on the\n\nmachining induced residual stress seems to be a reasonable approach. For\n\nthis reason, results are expressed in terms of the principal stresses ?1 and\n\n?2. To assess the cutting parameters effects on machining induced residual\n\nstresses, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted.\n\n(a) Radial in-plane sensitivity and DOE\ncross-section.\n\n(b) Illumination principle\n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Illumination details of the employed setup [6].\n\n4.7.2 Analysis from microhardness testing\n\nMicrohardness testing was performed to analyse the drilling ef-\n\nfect on the hole surroundings microstructure. Metallographic specimen\n\npreparation was carried out prior to microhardness testing observing stan-\n\ndardised guidelines from ASTM and ASM [66, 67]. The hole cross-section\nwas obtained with a metallographic cut-off machine which uses wet abrasive\n\ncutting to impinge less damage than other sectioning techniques; afterwards,\n\nspecimens were hot mounted using a phenolic resin at 150\u00b0C and 14.7 MPa\n\nduring 10 minutes. Grinding and polishing steps are found in Table 4.7.\n\nMicrohardness measurements were made using a Shimadzu HMV-\n\n2 microhardness tester at LABCONF/UFSC \u2013 Laborat\u00f3rio de Conforma\u00e7\u00e3o\nMec\u00e2nica following instructions from ISO 6507-1:2005 \u2013 Metallic materials\n\n\u2013 Vickers hardness test \u2013 Part 1: Test method [68]. Due to the different ma-\nterials behaviour, i.e. the extent of indentation influence is greater in softer\n\nmaterials such as aluminium, two microhardness measurement schemes\n\nwere used. The hole wall dimensions allowed four hole wall indentations\n\n\n\n90 Chapter 4. Experimental planning\n\nand three hole bottom indentations in aluminium alloy (Figure 4.11), while\n\nsix hole wall indentations and five hole bottom indentations could be made\n\nin both steels (Figure 4.10). Microhardness test loads and their application\n\ntimes are provided in Table 4.8. In order to verify microhardness changes\n\naround the hole, hole bottom and hole wall values were tested against the\n\nbase material values using a paired Welch t-test for unequal variances.\n\nTable 4.7 \u2013 Grinding and polishing steps.\n\nAISI 1020\nGrinding 120, 220, 360, 600, 1200 grits SiC paper\n\nPolishing 3 \u00b5m diamond paste, 0.3 \u00b5m alumina\n\nAISI 304L\nGrinding 120, 220, 360, 600, 1200 grits SiC paper\n\nPolishing 3 \u00b5m diamond paste, 0.3 \u00b5m alumina\n\nAA 6061\nGrinding 220, 360, 600, 1200 grits SiC paper\n\nPolishing 3 \u00b5m diamond paste, 1 \u00b5m diamond paste\n\nTable 4.8 \u2013 Microhardness testing parameters.\n\nMaterial Test load Force application time\n\nAISI 1020 1 kgf (9.8 N) 10s\n\nAISI 304L 1 kgf (9.8 N) 10s\n\nAA 6061 0.2 kgf (1.96 N) 5s\n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Indentation scheme in steel samples.\n\n\n\n4.7. Techniques and analyses 91\n\nFigure 4.11 \u2013 Indentation scheme in aluminium alloy sample.\n\n4.7.3 Analysis from scanning electron and optical microscopy\n\nWhen a sample is exposed to an electron beam, various signals\n\nare produced from the interactions between the atoms in the sample and\n\nthe incident electrons: this is scanning electron microscopy (SEM) basic\n\nprinciple. Some examples of signals are secondary electrons, backscattered\n\nelectrons, characteristic X-rays, Auger electrons, and so forth; depending on\n\nthe signal nature, different types of information about the sample can be\n\nobtained.\n\nIn this work, chips and burrs were visualised through secondary\n\nelectron imaging (SEI), since secondary electrons are low-energy electrons\n\ngenerated near the surface and for this reason images produced from this\n\nkind of signal provide information about the surface topography [69]. For\nthis purpose, a JEOL JSM-6390LV scanning electron microscope was used\n\nat LCME/UFSC \u2013 Laborat\u00f3rio Central de Microscopia Eletr\u00f4nica.\n\nTo look into the hole profile produced by the selected square end\n\nmill and provide a comparison with the current drilling process, hole cross-\n\nsection micrographs were acquired with a LEICA DM 4000 M optical micro-\n\nscope at LCM/UFSC \u2013 Laborat\u00f3rio de Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o Microestrutural. The\nhole cross-section images were obtained in specimens properly prepared\n\nand prior to microhardness measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nResults are grouped by workpiece material in order to provide\n\nwhole comprehension of the findings. For each material, the following\n\ntopics are investigated: chip formation, machining induced residual stress\n\nand microhardness changes. As AISI 304L austenitic stainless steel was the\n\nonly material used in both stages, its section presents also a brief additional\n\ndiscussion about the formed burr. The chapter is closed with a comparison\n\nbetween hole geometries obtained with the square end mills and the dental\n\ninverted-cone end mill currently employed by MTRES.\n\n5.1 STAINLESS STEEL AISI 304L\n\n5.1.1 Burr and chip formation\n\nThe first attribute to be analysed during the first stage was the\n\nburr formation, to verify whether its size may pose a problem to the optical\n\ntechnique. Figure 5.1 shows Polar software interface, used to process data\n\nand calculate stresses, in which three areas can be discerned: the circle inside\n\nred circumference is the hole, the annulus between the red circumference\n\nand the blue inner circumference corresponds to the discarded area, while\n\nthe annulus between the blue inner and outer circumferences is the useful\n\narea that actually provide information about strains and has its boundaries\n\ndefined by ASTM E837 \u2013 13a [3] for type A strain gage.\n\n\n\n94 Chapter 5. Results and discussion\n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Measuring area and discarded area.\n\nBurr formation was negligible for the optical technique utilisation,\n\nsince it was always restrained to a very thin area around the hole border,\n\nhaving an extension of approximately 1 \u00b5m, as observed in Figure 5.2 and\n\n5.3. Since the measuring inner boundary has about 2.20 mm and the drilled\n\nholes have around 1.55 mm, burr formation does not seem to be a concern\n\nto the optical measurement technique and for this reason this analysis were\n\nnot performed in the second stage for all workpiece materials.

Stainless steel AISI 304L 97\n\nAustenitic stainless steels present high plastic deformability due to\n\ntheir face-centred cubic crystal lattice, which results in several slip systems.\n\nThis feature favours not only the built-up edge and gluing-points formation,\n\nbut it also contributes to the production of undesired ribbon and snarled\n\nchips [23].\n\nAn overview comparison of the formed chips during AISI 304L\n\ndrilling using a two-flute end mill is provided in Figure 5.4. In fact, using a\n\ntwo-flute end mill, snarled chips were formed using the lowest rotational\n\nspeed (10,000 rpm) for all feed rates. These snarled chips proved to be a very\n\nprejudicial feature, as seen in Figure 5.2, where radial scratches can be seen\n\nto the corresponding cutting parameters combinations. This can be better\n\nunderstood seeing Figure 5.5, in which radial scratches caused by continuous\n\nchips invaded the measuring area and provoked loss of correlation where\n\nthe strains are intenser, near the measuring perimeter inner boundary.\n\nUsing the lowest feed rate (1 mm/min), the most similar condition\nto the one used currently by MTRES drilling module, unfavourable chip\n\nformation was detected for all the rotational speeds: a very thin snarled\n\nchip was formed, indicating that the minimum chip thickness was barely\n\nsurpassed. In addition, a powdery and irregular aspect was seen for higher\n\nrotational speeds, similar to those chips reported by Bl\u00f6dorn [7]. Using 10\nand 20 mm/min feed rates, two chip widths can be observed due to the two\nasymmetrical cutting edges: the minor produced around 80 \u00b5m wide chips,\n\nwhile the major cut approximately 450 \u00b5m wide chips. Particularly using\n\nhigher rotational speeds (25,000 and 40,000 rpm) associated to higher feed\n\nrates (10 and 20 mm/min), chips seemed to be properly formed without\nfavouring continuous morphology due to smaller thickness that facilitated\n\nchip breakage; these are desirable characteristics in the aimed application.\n\n\n\n98 Chapter 5.

In contrast, for the higher\nfeed rates (10 and 20 mm/min) using all the rotational speeds, a regular chip\nformation was reached possibly because the feed per tooth was greater than\n\nthe minimum chip thickness. This transition from favourable to unfavourable\n\nchip formation occurs because plastic deformation process changes as the\n\nuncut chip thickness and the grain size become comparable; when this\n\ncondition is reached, grain boundaries, impurities and crystal defects matter.\n\nIn this regime, shear energy increases as the uncut chip thickness gets thinner\n\n[70]. Plus, the patterns observed when using vf =1 mm/min suggests that\nthe chip load in a single rotation was insufficient, therefore only after several\n\nrotations as the feed advances the chip load was enough to form a chip;\n\nmeanwhile, the material suffered rubbing and work hardening as the end\n\nmill rotates without metal cutting [71].\n\n\n\n100 Chapter 5.

Nonetheless, fluctua-\n\ntions in the drilling process may happen and long, continuous chip may also\n\nbe formed, as radial marks in Figure 5.3e indicates. Concerning the lowest\n\nfeed rate (1 mm/min), a similar tendency as the two-flute end mill towards\npoor chip formation was observed for all rotational speeds, thin chips with\n\na fragile appearance were seen instead of the powdery aspect observed\n\nfor the two-flute end mill, worsening as the feed per tooth decreases with\n\nincreasing rotational speed. Looking at the chip upper surface in Figure\n\n5.8 using the lowest feed rate, the same poor cutting process dominated\n\nby intense plastic deformation observed with a two-flute end mill is seen.\n\nHowever, examining the chip upper surface for all the other cutting param-\n\neters combinations, regular material layers arise and may indicate that the\n\nminimum chip thickness is close to the feed per tooth.\n\nConsidering the chip size and form discussion for both cutting tools,\n\nthe highest feed rates (10 and 20 mm/min) and highest rotational speeds\n(25,000 rpm and 40,000 rpm) were chosen, since they provided smaller\n\nchip sizes without excessive plastic deformation.\n\n\n\n102 Chapter 5.

Results and discussion\n\n5.1.2 Machining induced residual stress\n\nDuring the first residual stresses measurements, two catastrophic\n\ntool breakages took place while attempting to drill the first holes. For this\n\nreason, it was established that only two repetitions would be made for\n\neach cutting parameter combination during AISI 304L drilling. Snarled\n\nchips were also formed by chance, despite eliminating the most favourable\n\ncutting parameters for their inception, since the material nature is prone\n\nto their production. For this reason, some points that delivered unreliable\n\ndata were eliminated and only a single point for those cutting parameters\n\ncombinations (b and B) was available to conduct this analysis and therefore\n\nMTRES maximum error was used for these tests instead of sample standard\n\ndeviation. Collected data can be found in Table B.1 \u2013 Appendix B.\n\nIn Figures 5.9 and 5.10, maximum and minimum machining in-\n\nduced residual stresses mean values are plotted for each cutting parameter\n\ncombination for both end mills types, accompanied by their sample standard\n\ndeviation whenever applicable; their values can be found in Tables 5.1 and\n\n5.2. The sample standard deviation was plotted instead of the confidence\n\ninterval in order to focus on the data dispersion. Since the flute number\n\nevidently exerts an influence on residual stress introduction, ANOVA was\n\napplied separately to assess the rotational speed and feed rate effects for\n\neach cutting tool.\n\na b c d\n\n?100\n?50\n\n0\n\nTest\n\n?\n1\n[M\n\nPa\n]\n\nTwo-flute\n\nA B C D\n\n?100\n?50\n\n0\n\nTest\n\n?\n1\n[M\n\nPa\n]\n\nFour-flute\n\nFigure 5.9 \u2013 Machining induced maximum residual stress ?1 during AISI\n304L drilling.\n\n\n\n5.1.

Veiga, personal communication, October 22, 2015).\n\nCompressive stresses with higher magnitudes have been introduced\n\ninto the workpiece for almost all cutting parameters combinations, indi-\n\ncating that intense plastic deformation occurred in the hole walls, possibly\n\nassociated with ploughing action that occurs with a protusion of the primary\n\ndeformation zone below the tool nose given by material adhesion [50]. In\naddition, when uncut chip thickness drops below two times the tool edge\n\nradius, cutting efficiency decays dramatically and chip is barely formed at\n\nthe cost of increased temperature, residual stresses and forces [72]. In this\ncase, this effect was very aggressive since the feed per tooth and tool edge\n\nradius ratio was between 0.41% and 3.1%.\n\nFeed rate seems to be the most important cutting parameter using\n\na four-flute end mill. The lowest machining residual stresses occurred when\n\ndrilling with a four-flute end mill using lower feed rate (10 mm/min) for\nboth rotational speeds. A possible explanation for this behaviour is an\n\nequilibrium between thermal and mechanical contributions, since lower\n\nfeed rates mean higher interaction times between a rotating cutting tool\n\nand the workpiece. Mechanical effects that tend to compressive stresses are\n\ncounterbalanced with higher heat generation which favours tensile stress.\n\n\n\n5.1.

Opposing trends were observed for two-flute and four-flute cutting\n\ntools, since higher feed rate seemed to produce less residual stresses using\n\nthe two-flute end mill and more residual stresses with a four-flute end mill.\n\nUsing four-flute end mill, two plateaux could be discerned for each feed\n\nrate, with little effect for rotational speed. This is in good agreement with\n\nliterature, as the feed rate was already pointed out as the most relevant\n\nprocess by previous work and cutting speed exerted little effect in residual\n\nstress introduction [73].\n\n\n\n5.1. Stainless steel AISI 304L 111\n\nIntense compressive residual stress fields are also associated with\n\nstrain hardening tendencies AISI 304L presents. Plus, Capello [74] affirms\nthat in general the level of residual stresses increases with increasing me-\n\nchanical properties. Brinksmeier et al. [48] suggests that considerable plastic\ndeformation leads to compressive residual stresses, having the tool sharp-\n\nness has a major influence. Compressive residual stresses were also observed\n\nduring AISI 304 stainless steel turning by [49]. Given the feeds per tooth,\ncutting edge radius and AISI 304L mechanical properties, the high magni-\n\ntude machining induced residual stresses found for most conditions is an\n\nexpected result. The author believes that high speed machining may actually\n\nbring some benefits in the case of alloys prone to intense work hardening\n\nas AISI 304L, as the material resistance limits decrease with increasing\n\ntemperatures in the shearing zone.\n\n5.1.3 Microhardness\n\nMicrohardness mean values were plotted with a 95% confidence\n\ninterval in Figure 5.15 and 5.16 using a two-flute end mill and a four-flute\n\nend mill respectively; the Sample 0 correspond to the base material.

The combinations vf =\n10 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm, vf = 20 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm did\nnot produce significant changes in the hole bottom microhardness, while\n\nfor the other cutting parameters combinations the microstructure were\n\nsignificantly changed.\n\nHole wall microhardness change using a two-flute square end mill\n\nis investigated in Table C.2. The hole walls microhardness increased for all\n\nthe cutting parameters combinations, which endorses the highly compressive\n\nresidual stresses found in the previous section.\n\nUsing a four-flute square end mill, the hole bottom microhardness\n\nsuffered noticeable changes for most cutting parameters combinations,\n\nexcept for the vf = 10 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm, as seen in Table\nC.3, which was also the one that presented less machining residual stress\n\nintroduction.\n\nTable C.2 shows that significant changes in microhardness were\n\nfound for n = 25, 000 rpm, which are possibly associated with chip rubbing\nand burnishing at higher rates against the hole walls, as the chip pockets\n\nare smaller in a four-flute tool and their disposal becomes problematic.\n\nLooking into an overall panorama, using a four-flute end mill\n\n\n\n5.1. Stainless steel AISI 304L 113\n\nprovokes less changes in the hole wall microstructure than using a two-flute\n\nend mill. However, no general trend was observed concerning the hole\n\nbottom microhardness values for both cutting tools. A possible explanation\n\nfor this behaviour is the random built-up edges formation since AISI 304L\n\nfavours this condition, concomitant to the excessive material smearing in\n\nthe end mill centre, which happens in a more uncontrolled way since the\n\ncutting tool is not properly designed for drilling operations.\n\nSince Bl\u00f6dorn [7] observed that hole walls suffered microhardness\nincreases for all conditions tested and the present study found the same result\n\nfor the two-flute square end mill, the mechanical influence predominance\n\nover the thermal effect is very clear, despite the low thermal conductivity\n\nand heat generated from tool friction and plastic deformation that makes\n\nthe cutting zone reach high temperatures.\n\n\n\n114 Chapter 5. Results and discussion\n\n5.2 CARBON STEEL AISI 1020\n\n5.2.1 Chip formation\n\nCarbon steel AISI 1020 has two main constituents: ferrite and\n\nperlite. Ferrite presents a tendency to form unfavourable chips such as\n\nsnarled and ribbon types due to its high deformability, being also prone to\n\nadhesion and built-up edge formation. On the other hand, perlite reduces\n\nadhesion and built-up edge formation tendencies, also helping to form more\n\nfavourable chip forms [23]. Since the main carbon steel components present\nopposite effects, depending on their proportions good machining conditions\n\nmay be expected.\n\n(a) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm (b) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm\n\n(c) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm (d) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm\n\nFigure 5.17 \u2013 Chip comparison using a two-flute square end mill during\nAISI 1020 drilling.\n\n\n\n5.2. Carbon steel AISI 1020 115\n\nAISI 1020 drilling employing a two-flute end mill produced the\n\nchips shown in Figure 5.17. Using vf = 10 mm/min, very thin and therefore\nfragile chips were formed for both rotational speeds, which is a desirable\n\nfeature because it facilitates chip breakage. Thicker chips were obviously\n\nformed using vf = 20 mm/min, presenting wider widths (about 400 \u00b5m)\ndue to the larger cutting edge engagement. Using vf = 20 mm/min and\nn = 25, 000 rpm, a more continuous chip was formed, but it still seems to\nbe very thin. Figure 5.18 shows in higher magnification that chip forma-\n\ntion presented regular and periodic shear fronts, without excessive plastic\n\ndeformation for all the tested conditions.\n(a) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm (b) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm\n\n(c) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm (d) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm\n\nFigure 5.18 \u2013 Chip upper surface comparison using a two-flute square end\nmill during AISI 1020 drilling.\n\n\n\n116 Chapter 5.

Using n = 40, 000 rpm,\nnarrower chips were noticeably formed. Figure 5.20 shows that similarly to\n\ntwo-flute cutting tool utilisation, chip formation occurred in regular shear\n\nfronts, but plastic deformation appears to be slightly worse in the chip\n\nborders as the feed per tooth is half of those obtained by a two-flute end\n\nmill. As commented previously, the cutting edge is not fully engaged in metal\n\ncutting using these cutting parameters combinations; nevertheless, the small\n\nportion that penetrates into the workpiece seems to be cutting satisfactorily\n\nthe material. For these reasons, these chips seem to be adequate both from\n\nthe machining point of view and ESPI utilisation.\n\n\n\n5.2.

Bl\u00f6dorn [7] found\ndecrease in microhardness on the hole surroundings for this material, sug-\n\ngesting that the thermal load in the present process is much lower than those\n\nachieved with MTRES due to much smaller rotational speeds, which results\n\nin lower interaction times with a rotating cutting tool and heat generation\n\nfrom frictional effects.\n\n\n\n5.3. Aluminium alloy AA 6061 125\n\n5.3 ALUMINIUM ALLOY AA 6061\n\n5.3.1 Chip formation\n\nDue to AA 6061 aluminium alloy composition, hard and brittle\n\nsilicon inclusions facilitate chip breakage. Aluminium alloys often present\n\nmore favourable chips the harder they are [23], for this reason AA 6061\u2013T4\nand AA 6061\u2013T4 are known by their good machinability. However, workpiece\n\nmaterial is AA 6061\u2013O corresponding to annealed condition, too soft and\n\nfor this reason chip formation may be problematic since this temper favours\n\nbuilt-up edge formation [58].\n\n(a) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm (b) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm\n\n(c) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm (d) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm\n\nFigure 5.29 \u2013 Chip comparison using a two-flute square end mill during AA\n6061 drilling.\n\n\n\n126 Chapter 5. Results and discussion\n\nUsing a two-flute end mill, Figure 5.29 shows that AA 6061 chips\n\nthat are significantly thicker (around 100 \u00b5m) than those formed during\n\nboth steels machining. A viscous and irregular appearance was observed.\n\nThe stick-slip mechanism is crucial in the chip formation process since it\n\naffects chip curl and the degree of plastic deformation [70]. This mechanism\nis particularly influenced by the strong adhesion tendency presented by this\n\nsoft material, especially when in contact with a cutting edge with a grooved\n\nsurface finish. Figure 5.30 shows that for vf = 10 mm/min, chips present\nmore intense plastic deformation effects than using vf = 20 mm/min,\nin which more organized layers were formed as the chip slips. Using vf =\n20 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm particularly, a lamellar pattern is observed.\n\n(a) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm (b) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm\n\n(c) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm (d) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm\n\nFigure 5.30 \u2013 Chip upper surface comparison using a two-flute square end\nmill during AA 6061 drilling.\n\n\n\n5.3.

These images suggest that the cutting parameters\n\ncombination tested are in a cutting regime transition range, microstructural\n\nchanges and process oscillations seem to exert great influence in chip for-\n\nmation. Figure 5.32 suggests that vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm\nproduces a chip mostly by ploughing effects instead of proper metal cutting,\n\nsince this cutting parameter combination results in smaller feed per tooth\n\nthan the other cases, that seem to generate more regular shear fronts.\n\n(a) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm (b) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm\n\n(c) vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm (d) vf = 20 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm\n\nFigure 5.31 \u2013 Chip comparison using a four-flute square end mill during AA\n6061 drilling.\n\n\n\n128 Chapter 5.

This behaviour\n\nis in good agreement with literature, since tensile residual stresses in 7075\n\naluminium alloy high-speed milling was already reported by Tang et al. [75]\nusing a worn cutting tool. Even if a new cutting tool was used during this\n\nexperiment, the end mill can be considered dull since the first drilling given\n\nthe ratio between fz and ? as aforementioned.\n\n5.3.3 Microhardness\n\nDuring the microhardness measurements in aluminium alloy AA\n\n6061 samples, the bulk material microhardness differed from workpiece to\n\nworkpiece.

Drilling using the lowest feed\n\nrates (vf = 10 mm/min) provoked an increase in the hole bottom micro-\nhardness; H0 was not tightly rejected for both cases at ?= 0.05 level. On\nthe other hand, drilling performed with higher feed rates (vf = 20 mm/min)\nbarely affected the hole bottom microhardness; strong evidences of this fact\n\nare provided by the high P-values found.\n\nHole wall microhardness values were not significantly changed\n\nby the drilling using a two-flute end mill in all the tested combination of\n\nparameters, as shown in Table C.10. High P-values obtained for this set\n\nof tests indicate weak evidence that the metal cutting introduced severe\n\nnon-homogeneities into the hole wall. Heat generation was not intense\n\n\n\n136 Chapter 5. Results and discussion\n\nsince microhardness values did not suffer a noticeable decrease, which is\n\na reasonable outcome since the energy consumed to machine aluminium\n\nalloys are relatively low when compared to other metals. Even though ASTM\n\nE837 \u2013 13a [3] expresses a concern about the rubbing between the hole\nwall and a square end mill peripheral cutting edges, low friction between\n\ncutting tool and workpiece can also be deduced from this result, indicating a\n\nfavourable combination of cutting tool coating and workpiece material; thus,\n\nthe utilisation of an inverted-cone end mill to avoid unnecessary rubbing as\n\nrecommended by the standard may not bring much benefit over a properly\n\nselected square end mill.\n\nAs seen in Table C.11, the hole bottom microhardness values were\n\nnot strongly affected by drilling for almost all cases (vf = 10 mm/min and\nn = 25, 000 rpm; vf = 20 mm/min and n = 25, 000 rpm; vf = 20 mm/min\nand n = 40, 000 rpm). It is worth mentioning that H0 could be barely\nrejected in vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm at ? = 0.05, since the\nP-value was 0.047; i.e. there is not strong evidence to assert that the drilling\n\nis producing a significant change in the hole bottom microhardness for this\n\ncondition.\n\nIn Table C.12, a similar trend is observed in the hole wall mi-\n\ncrohardness for the following cutting conditions: vf = 10 mm/min and\nn = 25, 000 rpm; vf = 10 mm/min and n = 40, 000 rpm; vf = 20 mm/min\nand n = 25, 000 rpm, in which the drilling seems to exert little influence in\nthe surrounding microstructure. However, for the case vf = 20 mm/min and\nn = 40, 000 rpm, the hole wall microhardness value increased significantly,\nindicating a work hardening. A possible explanation is the chip adhesion\n\non the cutting tool surface that may have happened during this drilling\n\noperation, in a way that the material was smeared against the hole wall\n\nsince chip disposal becomes more problematic with increasing flute number.\n\nSummarising briefly, aluminium alloy AA 6061 drilling produced\n\nminor changes in the hole surroundings microhardness for both two-flute\n\nand four-flute end mills, indicating that the microstructure was not strongly\n\ndisturbed by the metal cutting process; this outcome corroborates the small\n\n\n\n5.3. Aluminium alloy AA 6061 137\n\nmachining induced residual stresses measured, as explored in the previous\n\nsection, and denotes a good choice of cutting tool and cutting parameters for\n\nHDM residual stress measurement purposes in this type of material. During\n\nAA 6061 drilling, Bl\u00f6dorn [7] reported a decrease in the hole surroundings\nmicrohardness, i.e. the temperature rise was excessive despite the material\n\nhigh thermal diffusivity that dissipates heat quickly. For this reason, the\n\nprocess seems to be less aggressive than the used by MTRES also for this\n\nmaterial.\n\n\n\n138 Chapter 5. Results and discussion\n\n5.4 HOLE GEOMETRY\n\nFigure 5.41 presents a comparison on the same scale between the\n\nhole cross-sectional profile obtained when drilling all tested materials with\n\nthe 1.6 mm inverted-cone dental end mill currently employed by MTRES\n\nand the selected square end mills. All holes are 1 mm deep, as advised by\n\nthe standard [3].\n\n(a) Dental end mill, AISI 304L [7] (b) Square end mill, AISI 304L\n\n(c) Dental end mill, AISI 1020 [7] (d) Square end mill, AISI 1020\n\n(e) Dental end mill, AA 6061 [7] (f) Square end mill, AA 6061\n\nFigure 5.41 \u2013 Hole profiles comparison.\n\nClearly, square end mills generate a geometry closer to the ideal\n\ncylindrical profile suggested by ASTM E837 since they do not present the\n\n\n\n5.4. Hole geometry 139\n\nchamfer. This element was introduced in the inverted-cone dental end\n\nmill design to increase tool tip robustness. Even with the chamfer, tool tip\n\nbreakage was often reported using the inverted-cone dental end mill [7, 42].\n\nWhen using this inverted-cone end mill, residual stress calculations\n\nmay present significant errors if correction coefficients in the computational\n\nmodel are not properly adjusted to this complex geometry, since the chamfer\n\nsize is comparable to a drilling step and changes significantly the stress\n\nrelief distribution. Sharper corners were obtained using the square end mills,\n\nwhich have a radius much smaller than the drilling steps and therefore\n\nstandardized correction coefficients could be used without introducing\n\nsignificant errors.\n\nAnother important influence that contributed to the obtained hole\n\ngeometries is the machine tool. Even though the employed end mills differ\n\nonly 0.1 mm in diameter, the hole diameters obtained with MTRES clearly\n\nare at least 0.2 mm wider. The pneumatic turbine use associated with low\n\nrigidity bearings may have provoked significant run-outs. Certainly, these\n\nfeatures must be improved in the new MTRES drilling module design and\n\nwill also help to avoid constant tool breakages.\n\n\n\n\n\n141\n\n6 CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this chapter, the main conclusions drawn from this work are\n\nsummarized and ideas for further works are pointed out.\n\n6.1 CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this work, cutting tools and cutting parameters combinations\n\nwere selected and tested concerning the Hole-Drilling Method application\n\nwith ESPI to measure displacements both from machining and metrological\n\nperspectives. Feed rate and rotational speed effects on machining induced\n\nresidual stresses and microhardness were investigated in three types of\n\nmaterial.\n\nDuring preliminary tests, snarled chips were formed in AISI 304L\n\ndrilling using n = 10,000 rpm at all feed rates, and for this reason this\nrotational speed was not used further. This continuous chip proved to be ex-\n\ntremely prejudicial to the interferogram data reliability, since the reference\n\nsurface was scratched during the end mill rotation. Hence, cutting param-\n\neters that favour continuous chip formation should be avoided whenever\n\nESPI is being used to measure strains. Powdery or too thin chips associated\n\nwith poor metal cutting process were observed when using vf =1 mm/min,\nbeing also eliminated from the final tests. Burr formation do not pose a\n\nproblem to the optical measuring process, since the burr is very small and\n\nthe useful measuring area is far from it.\n\nThe combination of workpiece material, cutting tool geometry, cut-\n\nting tool coating and cutting parameters during stainless steel AISI 304L dry\n\ndrilling provoked an intense compressive stress state, inadequate to residual\n\nstress measurement purposes for most tested parameters, except for vf =10\nmm/min and n = 25,000 rpm, which resulted in a machining induced\nmaximum residual stress ?1 = 4\u00b110 MPa. Microhardness values increased\nin almost all the cases when this property experienced significant change,\n\n\n\n142 Chapter 6. Conclusions\n\nwhich means that the plastic deformation is the predominant effect over\n\nheating from frictional effects; this is in good agreement with compressive\n\nresidual stresses found in most conditions, which may be explained by the\n\nAISI 304L tendency to work hardening.\n\nFavourable chips were formed during AISI 1020 drilling, presenting\n\nsmall sizes and being properly cut as the chip upper surface presented\n\nregularly formed shear fronts, however the vf =20 mm/min and n = 25,000\nrpm using a two-flute end mill seemed to favour the undesired continuous\n\nchip formation. Using a four-flute cutting tool, smaller and narrower chips\n\nwere obtained, being possibly the preferred option since chip removal by\n\nsuction would be easier; besides, low machining induced residual stresses\n\nwere observed for all cutting parameters combinations, in particular using\n\nvf =10 mm/min and n = 25,000 rpm that resulted in a machining induced\nmaximum residual stress ?1 = 6\u00b114 MPa. Another good combination was\nvf =10 mm/min and n = 40,000 rpm using a two-flute end mill, that yielded\n?1 = 4\u00b114 MPa. As in AISI 304L steel, microhardness values increased with\ndrilling in almost all the conditions this property was significantly altered.\n\nWhen drilling AA 6061, minimum chip thickness is likely within\n\nthe tested feed per tooth range, as two chip upper surface patterns were\n\nclearly distinguished. Even though AA 6061 chips seemed to be intensely\n\ndeformed, it may be a consequence of how material softness, low melting\n\ntemperature and its tendency to adhere on the cutting tool surface affects\n\nthe stick-slip mechanism, as the chip is removed from the cutting area at\n\nlower rates than it is produced. In general, four-flute square end mills overall\n\nperformance was better than those of two-flute square end mills; while the\n\nformer presented lower machining induced residual stresses absolute values\n\nand low data dispersion, the latter presented greater data scattering and\n\nintroduced higher stress levels. A machining induced maximum residual\n\nstress ?1 = 8\u00b12 MPa obtained with vf =20 mm/min and n = 40,000 rpm\nseemed to be the best solution for AA 6061. Microhardness values were\n\nmostly unaffected by drilling and increased in all instances a significant\n\nmodification was spotted.\n\n\n\n6.1. Conclusions 143\n\nThe main outputs of this work are shown in Table 6.1, in which\n\nthe recommended solutions and their characteristics are summarised.\n\nTable 6.1 \u2013 Recommended cutting parameters combinations and their fea-\ntures.\n\nAISI 304L AISI 1020 AA 6061\n\nMaximum\nresidual stress\n\n4 \u00b110 6 \u00b114 8 \u00b12\n\nMinimum\nresidual stress\n\n-7 \u00b16 -2 \u00b15 3 \u00b11\n\nCutting\nparameters\n\n25,000 rpm\n10 mm/min\n\n25,000 rpm\n10 mm/min\n\n40,000 rpm\n20 mm/min\n\nCutting tool Four-flute Four-flute Four-flute\n\nChip form Favourable Favourable Favourable\n\nAnother important remark is that residual stress measurements\n\npresented low sample standard deviation, despite having only few available\n\nsamples. This result may be attributed to the machine tool high rigidity, and\n\nalso indicates that the end mill used in this work can properly drill several\n\nholes without suffering aggressive tool wear that would justify the frequent\n\nreplacement by a new cutting tool.\n\nThe microhardness increases in almost all samples suggest that the\n\nthermal effect on the microstructure due to high rotational speeds was lesser\n\nthan the plastic deformation influence likely related to the chip burnishing\n\nagainst the hole surfaces.\n\nHole geometries obtained with the selected square end mills were\n\ncompared to the inverted-cone end mills currently employed by MTRES.\n\nThe new cutting tool produces a hole geometry closer to the ideal geometry\n\nsuggested by ASTM E837 \u2013 13a. Evidence shows that MTRES drilling module\n\nrigidity is an attribute to be improved.\n\n\n\n144 Chapter 6. Conclusions\n\nNo general trend or rule of thumb can be given for the tested mate-\n\nrials regarding both machining induced residual stresses and microhardness\n\nchange, since the author believes that the cutting parameters combinations\n\nwere in the transition from micromachining to macromachining; in this gray\n\nzone range, phenomena are not well-delineated. Nonetheless, feed rate was\n\nhighlighted in many ANOVA analyses as the most important factor concern-\n\ning machining induced residual stress within the tested cutting parameters\n\nrange.\n\nAmong the cutting tool and cutting parameters combinations, some\n\nconditions introduced low machining induced residual stresses into the\n\nworkpieces material and can be incorporated in a future MTRES version.\n\nWith this improvement, errors associated to the drilling process can be\n\nminimized during a real residual stress evaluation.\n\n6.2 SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK\n\nFurther work is yet to be done in the following aspects, regarding\n\nthe Hole-Drilling Method context:\n\n\u2022 decrease even more the allowed rotational speed, to reach values\n\nrecommended by machining literature and verify whether a less\n\nretroactive residual stress measurement is possible;\n\n\u2022 include recommendations also about the feed rates, instead of only\n\ninforming the cutting tool types and the rotational speed;\n\n\u2022 use a proper tool to perform a drilling operation and change the\n\nstandardised coefficients accordingly.\n\nConcerning MTRES design, the proposed improvements are:\n\n\u2022 design and validate an electrical drill using a brushless motor for\n\nbetter rotational speed control in a closed-loop;\n\n\u2022 implement the cutting parameters and cutting tool used in the\n\npresent work;\n\n\u2022 study the cutting tool effect using the dental inverted-cone end\n\nmill currently used in MTRES, under the same cutting conditions\n\n\n\n6.2. Suggestions for future work 145\n\nexplored by this work;\n\n\u2022 investigate tool wear evolution using a single end mill to drill\n\nusing only one cutting parameter combination with the purpose of\n\nestablishing the tool life that can be achieved with the proposed\n\ndrilling process;\n\n\u2022 provide a more stable, smoother and continuous feed replacing\n\nthe stepper motor with a sliding linear motor, such as ball screws\n\nactuators;\n\n\u2022 replace the dental turbine assembly in which only dental burrs fit\n\nwith a chuck compatible with drills for metal cutting to make the\n\ndrilling module more versatile;\n\n\u2022 improve the drilling module rigidity;\n\n\u2022 test API grade steels that are actually used in the oil and gas industry\n\nas workpiece material.\n\n\n\n\n\n147\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n[1] MACHERAUCH, E.
