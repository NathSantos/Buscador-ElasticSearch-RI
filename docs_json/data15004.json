The continued large-scale and widespread consumption of fossil fuels and in \n\nparticular coal for power generation is necessary to sustain population and economic growth. Amongst \n\na spectrum of measures, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies have the potential to play a \n\nkey role, in response to climate change, by decarbonizing on a large scale the energy and other \n\nindustrial sectors.  \n\nThis thesis has been developed in the context of the COMET project, which is funded under the \n\nSeventh Framework Program. The COMET project goal is to assess the techno-economic feasibility of \n\nintegrating carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructures in the West Mediterranean area. This \n\nproject jointly coordinated by Portugal, Spain and Morocco considers several development scenarios \n\nfor these countries energy systems within the time period 2010-2050. These scenarios include the \n\nlocation and development of the energy related and industrial major CO2 point sources and the \n\navailable potential for geological storage in those countries. The long-term scenarios of the \n\nPortuguese, Spanish and Moroccan energy systems are to be modelled and evaluated through the \n\ntechnical economic MARKAL/TIMES models.  \n\nAs part of the COMET project, this thesis presents the quantitative and qualitative input data needed to \n\nmodel the energy system of Morocco via MARKAL/TIMES. The input data includes, among others: \n\nenergy conversion, consumption and CO2 emissions trends of the energy sector and other industrial \n\nactivities; the identification of the installed capacity and future perspectives; an assessment of the \n\nenergy end-use sectors; an estimation of the domestic energy related resources; and an assessment of \n\nrelevant energy policies as MARKAL/TIMES is well suited to evaluate the global impact of these \n\npolicies within the energy sector.  \n\nKey-words: CCS technologies, Energy System, Morocco, COMET \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nResumo \n\nAs fontes de energia renov\u00e1vel n\u00e3o s\u00e3o, e n\u00e3o ser\u00e3o, num futuro pr\u00f3ximo, suficientes para suprir as \n\nnecessidades globais de energia e por isso os combust\u00edveis fosseis ir\u00e3o continuar a ser utilizados em \n\nlarga escala. De facto, o cont\u00ednuo consumo dos recursos f\u00f3sseis e, em particular, do carv\u00e3o, para a \n\ngera\u00e7\u00e3o de electricidade ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1rio para sustentar o crescimento econ\u00f3mico e populacional. Para \n\nfazer face \u00e0s altera\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas, as tecnologias de captura e armazenamento de CO2, apresentam-se \n\ncomo uma op\u00e7\u00e3o para reduzir significativamente as emiss\u00f5es de CO2 para a atmosfera, associadas ao \n\nsistema electro-produtor e a outros processos industriais. \n\nEsta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o foi desenvolvida no \u00e2mbito do projecto COMET, financiado pelo S\u00e9timo Programa-\n\nQuadro. O objectivo do projecto COMET \u00e9 estudar a viabilidade t\u00e9cnico-econ\u00f3mica da integra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\numa estrutura de transporte e armazenamento de CO2 na zona oeste do Mediterr\u00e2neo. Este projecto \n\ncoordenado por Portugal, Espanha e Marrocos considera v\u00e1rios cen\u00e1rios dos sistemas energ\u00e9ticos \n\ndestes pa\u00edses para o per\u00edodo 2010-2050. Estes cen\u00e1rios incluem a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e desenvolvimento das \n\npricipais unidades emissoras de CO2 e o potencial de armazenamento geol\u00f3gico nos pa\u00edses envolvidos. \n\nOs cen\u00e1rios dos sistemas energ\u00e9ticos dos tr\u00eas pa\u00edses ser\u00e3o modelados recorrendo aos modelos \n\nMARKAL/TIMES.   \n\nComo parte integrante do projecto COMET, este trabalho apresenta a informa\u00e7\u00e3o quantitativa e \n\nqualitativa para modelar o sistema energ\u00e9tico de Marrocos via MARKAL/TIMES.

developed in the context of the COMET project. COMET project aims to study \n\nthe techno-economic feasibility of integrating carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructures in \n\nthe West Mediterranean area and it involves Portugal, Spain and Morocco. This project considers \n\nseveral development scenarios for those countries energy systems within the time period 2010-2050 \n\nand takes into account the location and development of the energy related and industrial major CO2 \n\nemission sources as well as the available potential for geological storage in those countries. These \n\ncountries long-term energy systems scenarios are to be modelled and evaluated through the technical \n\neconomic models MARKAL/TIMES.  \n\nAs part of COMET project this thesis presents the quantitative and qualitative input data to model the \n\nenergy system of Morocco via MARKAL/TIMES. The input data includes, among others: energy \n\ntransformation, consumption and CO2 emissions? trends of the energy sector and other industrial \n\nactivities; the identification of the installed capacity and future perspectives; an assessment of the \n\nenergy end-use sectors; an estimation of the national energy resources; and an assessment of relevant \n\nenergy related policies as MARKAL/TIMES is well suited to evaluate the global impact of policies \n\nwithin the energy sector. This thesis includes an analysis of the first modelling outcomes. \n\nThe present work is divided in nine chapters. Chapter two summarizes the past and present status of \n\nthe Energy Sector in a global perspective. It introduces the problematic of energy related GHG \n\nemissions and climate change and includes IEA energy scenarios for the next decades. The potential \n\nand main characteristics of the key climate change mitigation options are also reviewed in this chapter. \n\nChapter three overviews the CCS technologies process chain within its different options and \n\napplications. It summarizes the current status of the technologies in terms of projects, costs and \n\nregulatory and legal framework in a general approach. The fourth chapter presents the goals and \n\nmotivations of COMET project, its structure and the thesis?s role within the project itself. The fifth \n\nchapter presents the quantitative and qualitative information collected to model the energy system of \n\nMorocco via MARKAL/TIMES. Chapter six presents the final remarks. Chapter seven presents the \n\nconclusions of the thesis. Chapter eight identifies future work.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    3 \n\n \n\n2 Global Energy Demand and Energy-related CO2 Emissions \n\n2.1  Energy Demand and Supply  \n\nGlobal energy demand has been steadily rising over the past several decades. Population and income \n\ngrowth are key driving forces behind the demand for energy (IEA, 2010). As the global energy \n\ndemand upward trend is expected to continue in the coming decades, increasing uneasiness over \n\nenergy security and environmental sustainability issues arise.  \n\nIn 1971 the total primary energy supply (TPES) has been of 5533.5 Mtoe and, by 2008, it reached \n\n12267.4 Mtoe, which means that within that period the TPES more than doubled (IEA 2010). Figure \n\n2-1 presents the global population, real GDP using purchasing power parities (ppp) and TPES \n\nevolution within 1971 and 2008. \n\n0\n\n10000\n\n20000\n\n30000\n\n40000\n\n50000\n\n60000\n\n70000\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n8000\n\n9000\n\n10000\n\n11000\n\n12000\n\n13000\n\n1971 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2006 2007 2008\n\nTotal primary energy supply (Toe) Population GDP using ppp (2000 US Dollars)\n\nGDP \n\n(Billion) \n\nTPES/ \n\nPopulation\n\n(Million)\n\n \nFigure 2-1 \u2013 Evolution of the global TPES, population and GDP using ppp (within 1971 and 2008) \n\n(IEA, 2010) \n\nThe global energy intensity - the amount of energy necessary to generate each unit of GDP - has \n\ndecreased progressively over the last decades owing to several factors such as energy efficiency (EE) \n\nimprovements, fuel switching and structural adjustments in the global economy away from energy-\n\nintensive industries (IEA, 2010b). If no improvements in energy intensity had been accomplished, \n\nglobal energy consumption would be much higher today (IEA, 2010b).  \n\nIn 1980 and 2008 almost 85% and 81% of the global energy demand was supplied from fossil fuels. \n\nTable 2-1 presents the world primary energy demand by fuel in 1980 and 2008 (IEA, 2010b).   \n\nTable 2-1 \u2013 World primary energy demand by fuel (Mtoe) (IEA, 2010b) \n\n Oil Coal Gas Nuclear Hydro Biomass \n\nand waste* \n\nOther \n\nrenewables \n\nTotal \n\n2008 4059 3315 2596 712 276 1225 89 12271 \n\n1980 3107  1792 1234 186 148 749 12 7229 \n\n*Includes traditional and modern uses. \n\nIn 2009 the global economic recession induced the first energy consumption decline since 1982 which \n\nwas mostly felt in OECD countries and in the territory of the Former Soviet Union, in line with its \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    4 \n\n \n\neconomies condition. In that year global oil consumption dropped 1.7%, representing the major \n\ndecline since 1982. Coal consumption kept on fairly solid in 2009 representative of the minor annual \n\nchange since 1999. In 2009 natural gas consumption registered the most rapid decline amongst fossil \n\nfuels and fell by 2.1%. In that year only hydroelectric and other renewable forms of energy registered \n\nan output growth. Hydroelectric generation has been the world?s fastest-growing energy source in \n\n2009. Fiscal incentive, in many countries, among other government encouragement measures, induced \n\nthe global wind and solar generation capacity growth by 31% and 47% respectively. China and the US \n\naccounted for 62.4% of the whole wind generation growth (BP, 2010).  \n\nIn 2010 driven by the economic recovery, global energy consumption grew by 5.6% which \n\nrepresented the largest increase in percentage terms since 1973. The growth in energy consumption \n\nhas been felt worldwide: consumption in OECD countries grew by 3.5% and in non-OECD countries \n\nthe energy consumption increased by 7.5% and was 63% beyond the 2000 totals. In that year, China \n\nenergy consumption increased by 11.2% and became the world?s largest energy consumer followed by \n\nthe US (BP, 2011).  \n\nEnergy prices development diverged. Oil prices rebounded worldwide (average oil prices for that year \n\nas a whole have been the 2\nnd\n\n highest in history), whereas natural gas and coal prices varied by region. \n\nNatural gas prices increased significantly in markets indexed to oil prices. Coal prices increased \n\nstrongly in Europe but remained weak in Japan and North America (BP, 2011). \n\nAccounting for 33.6% of global energy consumption, oil continued the world?s most consumed fuel. \n\nAfter two succeeding years declining, global oil consumption increased 3.1% (reaching a record level \n\nof 87.4 million b/d). OECD consumption grew by 0.9%, the first grow after 2005. Beyond OECD, \n\nconsumption evolution recorded a 5.5% growth. Growth persisted strong in China and Middle Eastern \n\ncountries, with Chinese consumption rising by 10.4%. Even if 2010 has recorded the biggest \n\npercentage grow in oil consumption since 2004, it represents a minor global growth rate amongst \n\nfossil fuels (BP, 2011). \n\nIn 2010 coal accounted for 29.6% of global energy consumption and its consumption increased 7.6%, \n\nwhich represents the major overall growth since 2003. China accounted for nearly two-thirds of the \n\nglobal consumption growth. The coal consumption upsurge was also strong in OECD countries where \n\nconsumption grew by 5.2%, the most solid growth since 1979 (BP, 2011).    \n\nThe global natural gas consumption increased by 7.4% in 2010, which represents the fastest growth \n\nsince 1984. Except in the Middle East, consumption growth was beyond average in all regions. The \n\nUS had the world?s largest rise in consumption in volumetric terms, growing by 5.6%. Russia and \n\nChina both registered the largest volumetric increases in the country?s history. Consumption in other \n\nAsian countries grew fast as well (10.7%), with India increasing its consumption by 21.5% (BP, \n\n2011). \n\nWorldwide, hydroelectric and nuclear production registered the biggest upsurge since 2004. \n\nHydroelectric output increased by 5.3%. China was responsible for more than 60% of global \n\nhydroelectric growth owing to new capacity and wet weather. Global nuclear production increased by \n\n2% with three-quarters of the growth coming from OECD economies. French nuclear production \n\nincreased by 4.4%, which represented the major volumetric increase in the world. Globally, other \n\nrenewable energy (RE) sources continued to grow rapidly. Biofuel production increased by 13.8% in \n\nthat year and RE for power generation increased by 15.5%, owing to a steady growth in wind energy \n\n(22.7%) (BP, 2011). \n\n2.1.1 Energy-related CO2 Emissions  \n\nIn 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its Second Assessment Report, \n\nconcluded that there is a balance of evidence that suggests a discernible human influence on climate \n\nchange (IPCC, 1995). Indeed, even if GHG such as CO2, CH4, and N2O are constantly being emitted \n\nto the atmosphere through natural processes, over the last 250 years anthropogenic activities related \n\nemissions have significantly altered their atmospheric concentrations.  \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    5 \n\n \n\nThe CO2 atmospheric concentration has risen from 280 ppm in the pre-industrial period to 390 ppm by \n\nthe end of 2010 (IPCC, 2011).  One other noteworthy fact is that atmospheric CO2 concentration has \n\nincreased by just 20 ppm over the 8000 proceeding years to industrialization whereas, since 1750, it \n\nhas risen by more than 100 ppm. CO2 is one of the most prevalent GHG, and within the latter GHG \n\nspecified, CO2 presents the highest radiative forcing (RF\n1\n) (IPCC, 2005).   \n\nAmong the many human activities that emit CO2, the energy sector represents by far the largest source \n\nof emissions and fossil-fuel combustion is a central issue within the climate change debate. Besides \n\nfossil-fuel combustion within the power and the transport sectors, there are several other processes that \n\nemit substantial quantities of CO2. These, among others, include the following industrial intensive \n\nprocesses: cement, iron and steel, chemicals and petrochemicals, pulp and paper and aluminum \n\nmanufacture (IEA, 2011h). Changes in land use and forestry practices may, as well, release significant \n\namounts of CO2 or act as a sink for CO2.  \n\nBetween 1971 and 2008, global CO2 emissions from fuel combustion more than doubled, rising from \n\n14096.3 to 29381.4 million ton. In 2008, global CO2 emissions increased 0.4 Gt representing a growth \n\nrate of 1.5% comparatively to 2007 (IEA, 2010). In 2008, for the first time, the CO2 emission levels of \n\nthe Annex I countries dropped below 1990 levels and the aggregate emissions of the developing \n\ncountries has been superior to those from the developed countries (IEA, 2010). \n\n- Global Energy Related CO2 Emissions by Fuel \n\nCoal - the utmost carbon-intensive of fossil fuels with nearly twice the carbon content per unit of \n\nenergy as that of natural gas - has been, during the last decade, the fastest-growing energy source and \n\nthe rate of emissions from coal use has risen from 0.6% per year within 1990 and 2000 and 4.8% per \n\nyear within 2000 and 2007 (IEA, 2010b1) (IEA, 2011). Figure 2-2 presents the global CO2 emissions \n\nby fuel, within 1971 and 2008. \n\n \nFigure 2-2 \u2013 Global CO2 emissions by fuel (IEA, 2010) \n\nThis CO2 coal related emissions upsurge over a relatively short period can be explained by the \n\ngrowing energy demand in coal based economies and by the intensification of coal-fired power \n\ngeneration in response to higher oil and gas prices (IEA, 2010b1). In 2010, 44% of the estimated CO2 \n\nemissions came from coal, 36% from oil and 20% from natural gas (IEA, 2011k). \n\n                                                      \n\n1\n RF is a concept used for quantitative comparisons of the strength of different human and natural agents that \n\ntrigger climate change. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    6 \n\n \n\nThe environmental concerns related to the use of coal comprise not only the associated CO2 emissions \n\nand the implications of those for Climate Change but, among others: the emission of other gases and \n\nparticulates produced within the combustion process such as NOx, SO2 and toxic trace elements and \n\nthe disposal of ash and spoil from processes associated with the mining of coal in the air, water and \n\nland.  \n\n- Energy Related CO2 Emissions by Sector \n\nIn 2008, within the energy system, the power and heat generation sector was categorically the major \n\nproducer of CO2 emissions, being responsible for 41% of the CO2 emissions (Figure 2-4). In that year \n\nthe electricity generation sector emitted 11 Gt of CO2. In 2008, the combined share of the power and \n\nheat generation and the transport sectors accounted for two-thirds of the CO2 emissions. The transport \n\nand the manufacturing industries and constructions sectors accounted for 23% and 20% respectively of \n\nthe CO2 emissions in 2008 (IEA, 2010). Figure 2-3 presents the increasing share of the electricity and \n\nheat sectors on total energy related CO2 emissions.  \n\n \nFigure 2-3 \u2013 CO2 emissions by sector (IEA, 2010) \n\nGenerally, the power generation sector relies deeply on coal (IEA, 2010) (IEA, 2010b). Coal is crucial \n\nfor global energy security, it is abundantly available, with sufficient supplies for more than 150 years, \n\naffordable, reliable and, easy and safe to transport (IEA, 2010b) (IEA, 2011a). In 1990 the global \n\nshare of coal for power generation has been approximately 37%. In 2008, 41% of the global power \n\ngeneration came from coal, 21% from gas, 16% from hydro and 14% from nuclear (Table 2-2) (IEA, \n\n2010b). Countries such as Australia, China, India, Poland and South Africa generate between 69% and \n\n94% of their electricity and heat through coal combustion (IEA, 2010). Table 2-2 presents the global \n\nelectricity generation by source in 1990 and 2008. \n\nTable 2-2 \u2013 World electricity generation (TWh) (IEA, 2010b) \n\n 1990 2008 \n\nTotal generation 11821 20183 \n\nCoal 4427 8273 \n\nOil 1338 1104 \n\nGas 1726 4303 \n\nNuclear 2013 2731 \n\nHydro 2145 3208 \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    7 \n\n \n\n 1990 2008 \n\nBiomass and waste 131 267 \n\nWind 4 219 \n\nGeothermal 36 65 \n\nSolar PV 0 12 \n\nCSP 1 1 \n\nMarine 1 1 \n\n \n\nBy 2008 almost two-thirds of the global coal demand was for power sector consumption and another \n\none-fifth for industrial sector use (IEA, 2010b).  Since 1990 the share of coal in the power sector has \n\ngrown by 10 percentage points while the share in industrial energy use has declined slightly (IEA, \n\n2010b).  \n\nDecreasing CO2 emissions from coal-fired plants is a central concern within multiple proposals for \n\nmitigating GHG emissions. Options include capturing and sequestering the CO2 emitted from the coal \n\nplants, and increasing substituting coal-fired generation for other power sources such as wind or \n\nnuclear power. Another option is to replace coal power with increased use of natural gas generation \n\nsince gas fired power using modern generating technology releases less than half of the CO2 per MWh \n\nas of a coal-fired power plant (CRS, 2010).  In fact, a typical 500 MW coal-fired power plant will emit \n\naround 400 tonnes of CO2/h, whereas a modern natural gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC) plant of the \n\nsame size will emit about 180 tonnes of CO2/h in the flue gases (CSFL, 2010). \n\n2.1.2 Energy-related Past Trends Problematic  \n\nEven if in the past decade: \n\n- There has been a substantial rise in investment in RE worldwide; solar PV and wind power \nhave achieved considerable deployment; \n\n- The rate of EE development in OECD countries has begun to speed up again, after many years \nof modest gains; \n\n- Major car companies were adding hybrid and full?electric vehicles to their product lines and \nmany governments had launched plans to encourage consumers to buy these vehicles; and \n\n- Public investment for RD&amp;D in low?carbon technology reached an all?time high in 2009 \n(2011, IEA); \n\nin 2010, according to the IEA, the energy-related CO2 emissions reached the highest level in history \n\nand the present energy use and CO2 emissions trends run directly counter to the constant warnings sent \nby the United Nations IPCC (IEA, 2011k) (IEA, 2010b1).  \n\n2.2 Global Energy Scenarios and Climate Change \n\nThe increasing demand of energy is considered a global multifaceted issue with ever rising \n\ncomplexity. It involves not just the question of whether the expected rise in energy demand can be \n\nmet, but also whether this demand can be met sustainably, which mix of energy sources is optimal, \n\nand whether there may also be means to reduce demand without compromising the global economy.  \n\nThe IPCC stated that only scenarios resulting in a 50% to 80% reduction of global CO2 emissions by \n\n2050, compared to 2000 levels, can limit the long-term global mean temperature rise within 2.0\u00baC to \n\n2.4\u00baC. \n\nIn December 2009 heads of state met for the 15\nth\n\n Conference of Parties of the United Nations \n\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen. The resulting Copenhagen \n\nAccord, to which all major emitting countries and many others associated themselves, established a \n\nnon-binding goal of restraining the long-term average increase in the global temperature to 2\u00baC above \n\npre-industrial levels.

The 2\u00baC goal has been further recognized as critical in the United Nations Climate \n\nChange Conference, held in Cancun, in 2010. \n\nEven if the GHG in the atmosphere long-term stabilisation at 450 ppm by no means guarantees that the \n\ntemperature increase will be limited to 2\u00b0C, targeting a 450 ppm of CO2 equivalent concentration is \n\noften acknowledged as equivalent to the 2\u00b0C objective.  \n\nFor strategic analysis and long-term planning many energy scenarios are continually being reported by \n\neither national or international organizations such as the IEA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), \n\nthe European Commission and the World Energy Council (WEC). All these organizations state that in \n\nthe time frame of 2020-2030, worldwide energy demand will rise, keeping pace with population and \n\neconomic growth in developing countries.   \n\n- IEA Scenarios \n\nThe 2010 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO), published by the IEA, provides energy \n\ndemand and supply, updated projections until 2030 through three scenarios based on several different \n\nassumptions.  \n\nIts central scenario, entitled the New Policies Scenario (NPS), takes into account the general policy \n\nstrategies and commitments that have been announced by numerous countries worldwide, in order to \n\nrestrict the greenhouse effect and address energy security concerns, even where the measures to \n\nimplement these commitments have yet to be identified or announced. The potential impacts of the \n\nimplementation of those policy commitments on energy markets can be weighed, by comparing them \n\nwith the projections from the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) in which no change in policies as of \n\nmid-2010 is assumed to be implemented. The third scenario, the 450 Scenario, sets out an energy \n\npathway consistent with the target agreed at the UN climate meeting in Copenhagen in December \n\n2009 to limit the increase in global temperature to 2\u00baC above pre-industrial levels. This scenario \n\nassumes the implementation of the high-end of national pledges and tougher policies after 2020 \n\nincluding the nearly entire elimination of fossil fuel consumption subsidies (globally) to achieve the \n\nobjective of limiting the concentration of GHG in the atmosphere to 450 parts per million of CO2 \n\nequivalent (IEA, 2010b). \n\nAll three IEA scenarios have the same assumptions about population growth. Global population is \n\nprojected to grow from an estimated 6.7 billion in 2008 to around 8.5 billion in 2030 \u2013 an average rate \n\nof increase of nearly 1% per year. Most of the increase in global population will occur in non-OECD \n\ncountries, particularly in Asia and Africa. In fact, these countries population is estimated to increase \n\nfrom 5.5 billion in 2008 to 7.2 billion in 2035 corresponding to an average annual growth rate of 1%. \n\nIn the OECD countries, most of the population growth is expected in North America. Projections \n\nsuggest that the OECD population will increase by  0.4% annually, between 2008 and 2035 (IEA, \n\n2010b).  \n\nAll three IEA scenarios have the same assumptions regarding economic growth as well. The three \n\nscenarios projections are extremely sensitive to the GDP growth rate estimations since energy demand \n\ntends to rise in line with GDP, yet usually at a lower rate (IEA, 2010b). The 2010 edition of the WEO \n\nassumes that within the 2008-2035 time period the world economy grows on average by 4.4% per \n\nyear. OECD countries GDP annual growth is expected to reach 1.8% and non-OECD countries GDP is \n\nexpected to grow by 4.6% per year over the same projection period.  \n\n \n\n- Global Energy Demand  \n\nFor the 2008 to 2035 period the energy demand projections from the three WEO 2010 scenarios differ \n\nconsiderably. In the NPS global energy demand is projected to increase by 1.2% annually reaching \n\n16750 Mtoe by 2035. In the CPS, global energy demand is estimated to increase on a higher rate, by \n\n1.4% per year, reaching 18048 Mtoe by 2035. At a comparatively lower rate, in the 450 Scenario, the \n\nglobal energy demand grows by 1.7% annually reaching 14920 Mtoe by 2035 (Figure 2-6) (Energy \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    9 \n\n \n\nprices warrant that projected supply and demand are in balance during the Outlook period in all \n\nscenarios) (IEA, 2010b). \n\n \nFigure 2-4 \u2013 World primary energy demand by scenario (IEA, 2010b) \n\nThe policies that are assumed to be brought together in the NPS and 450 Scenario have a noteworthy \n\nimpact on the energy intensity rate decline over the projection period. In the CPS, the energy intensity \n\ndeclines as well, but at an inferior rate. Compared to 2008, by 2035 the energy intensity declines 28% \n\nin the CPS, 34% in the NPS and 41% in the 450 Scenario (IEA, 2010b). \n\nBy 2035 in all three scenarios, fossil fuels keep on being the dominant primary energy sources altough \n\ntheir share on the overall primary fuel mix differs significantly. By 2035 the fossil fuels share \n\nprojections from the NPS, the CPS and the 450 Scenario are 74%, 79% and 62% respectively. The \n\nrenewables and nuclear share projections are considerably higher in the 450 Scenario (Table 2-3) \n\n(IEA, 2010b).   \n\nTable 2-3 \u2013 World primary energy demand by fuel and scenario (Mtoe) (IEA, 2010b) \n\n NPS CPS 450 Scenario \n\n2020 2035 2020 2035 2020 2035 \n\nCoal 3966 3943 4307 5281 3743 2496 \n\nOil 4346 4662 4443 5026 4175 3816 \n\nGas 3132 3748 3166 4039 2960 2985 \n\nNuclear 968 1273 915 1081 1003 1676 \n\nHydro 376 476 364 439 383 519 \n\nBiomass and waste* 1501 1957 1461 1715 1539 2316 \n\nOther renewables 268 699 239 468 325 1112 \n\nTotal 14556 16748 14896 18048 14127 14920 \n\n* Includes traditional and modern uses. \n\n- Energy-related CO2 Emissions \n\nAccording to the IEA, in order to embark into a trajectory that is compatible with the long-term \n\nstabilisation of the atmospheric concentration at 450 ppm CO2-eq, energy-related emissions need to \n\nfall to 21.7 Gt CO2 by 2035 (IEA, 2010b).    \n\nEnergy Related CO2 Emissions in the NPS \n\nUnder the assumptions of the NPS, energy related emissions in the OECD countries peak before 2015 \n\nand decay to 11.8 Gt in 2020, 7% above 1990 levels. Supposing  that OECD countries intensify \n\ndomestic reduction efforts after 2020, OECD emissions gradually decline to 10 Gt in 2035. In non-\n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    10 \n\n \n\nOECD countries, energy-related CO2 emissions are projected to jump from 15.7 Gt in 2008 to 20.8 Gt \n\nby 2020 and 24 Gt by 2035 (IEA, 2010b).   \n\nIn 2008, coal has been responsible for the largest share on total CO2 emissions, followed by oil and \n\ngas. In the NPS this order remains identical by 2035. Still, the share of coal decreases to 41% and that \n\nof oil to 36%, while the share of gas extends to 24%. In 2008 emissions from bunker fuels accounted \n\nfor 3.5% and by 2035 its share increases to 4.0% (IEA, 2010b). \n\nEven though the projection for GHG emissions in the NPS represents a clear improvement on current \n\ntrends (emissions in the CPS reach 35.4 Gt in 2020 and continue to increase across the projected \n\nperiod), between 2008 and 2035, global energy related CO2 emissions increase by 21%, from 29.3 Gt \n\nto 35.4 Gt precluding the 450 ppm CO2 eq target. The NPS places the world in a path consistent with \n\nstabilising the concentration of GHG at just over 650 ppm CO2-eq, resulting in an estimated \n\ntemperature rise of over 3.5\u00baC above pre-industrial levels in the long term (IEA, 2010b). \n\nEnergy Related CO2 Emissions in the 450 Scenario \n\nThe 450 Scenario sets a path consistent with the long-term stabilisation of the atmospheric \n\nconcentration at 450 ppm of CO2 equivalent (emissions in the 450 Scenario reach 31.9 Gt in 2020 and \n\ndecline to 21.7 Gt in 3035). The GHG atmospheric concentration in the 450 Scenario reaches a highest \n\nat some 520 ppm CO2-eq around 2040 before declining back to 450 ppm CO2-eq by around 2150. This \n\nscenario points out the most economical way of meeting the climate goals, presenting, given the \n\ncurrent policy context, the scale of action required to do so (IEA, 2010b).   \n\nIn order to decarbonise the energy economy so drastically, the commitment of all countries to impose \n\ntougher supplementary and complementary abatement policies and measures as of 2020 is mandatory \n(IEA, 2010b).   \n\nThe elimination and reduction of subsidies on fossil fuels accounts for 1.4 Gt of CO2 emissions \n\navoidances in 2035 compared with the CPS. Substantial spending on energy efficiency and low-\n\ncarbon technologies in order to achieve the 450 Scenario is required, and further spending in the 2010-\n\n2035 period extends to $18 trillion compared with the CPS and $13.5 trillion compared with the NPS \n\n(IEA, 2010b).   \n\n- Global energy related CO2 emission savings by policy measure \u2013 IEA 450 Scenario  \n\nAtmospheric emissions avoidances in the 450 Scenario, comparatively to the CPS, amount to 3.5 Gt in \n\n2020 and to 20.9 Gt in 2035. The IEA identifies the most cost-effective portfolio of technologies to \n\nattain the latter emission reductions targets. The share of the different measures to be taken in pursuit \n\nof the 450 Scenario abatement commitments varies over time. Once low-cost options are exhausted, \n\nother expensive options have to be applied (Figure 2-7) (IEA, 2010b). \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    11 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2-5 \u2013 World energy-related CO2 emissions savings by policy measure in the 450 Scenario \n\n(IEA, 2010b) \n\nUnder the assumptions of the IEA 450 Scenario, the end-use efficiency share on the total CO2 \nabatement compared to the CPS is 67% by 2020 (when total abetment is of 3.5 Gt CO2). Whereas, by \n\n2035, at the time when total CO2 abatement target amounts to 20.9 Gt (in relation to the CPS), the CO2 \n\nabatement share of the end-use efficiency decreases to 47%. The CO2 price plays a critical role in EE \n\ndevelopments (IEA, 2010b).   \n\nAs long as support policies that go beyond the impact of the price of CO2 are established, RE \n\ndeployment together with biofuels, account for a rising share of CO2 savings throughout the projection \n\ntimeframe, increasing from 19% in 2020 to 24% in 2035. Nuclear power share on CO2 abatement by \n\nthe end of the projection period amounts to 8% (IEA, 2010b).   \n\nWithin the projection period CCS becomes a critical abatement technology and by 2035 it accounts for \n\nnearly one-fifth of the total CO2 abatement target. In this scenario, CCS is deployed in new coal and \n\ngas-fired power plants after 2020 in OECD+\n2\n and Other Major Economies\n\n3\n and is broadly used as a \n\nretrofit measure as well. CCS also becomes a fundamental abatement alternative in some emissions \n\nintensive industrial sectors, such as cement, iron and steel, chemicals, and pulp and paper, as well as in \n\nenergy transformation processes such as coal-to-liquids (IEA, 2010b). \n\nAccording to the IEA, decarbonizing the power sector is of crucial importance to make deep cuts on \n\nCO2 emissions and even though fossil fuels keep on being the dominant fuels on the primary energy \n\nmix in the 450 Scenario, the power sector is considerably decarbonised by 2035, especially in \n\ndeveloped countries, and over three-quarters of global electricity generation is low-carbon (IEA, \n\n2010b).  This low carbon target entails an intensive low-carbon technologies deployment in order to \ndisplace inefficient thermal plants, and to meet the growth in electricity demand, while keeping an \n\naffordable and secure service to consumers (Table 2-4) (IEA, 2010b).   \n\nTable 2-4 \u2013 Capacity additions by fuel and region in the 450 Scenario (GW) (IEA, 2010b) \n\n 2010-2020 2021-2035 \n\n World OECD+ OME OC World OECD+ OME OC \n\nCoal 576 91 356 127 438 140 236 62 \n\nCCS-equipped* 13 9 3 1 408 188 213 8 \n\nOil 31 6 17 8 35 9 13 12 \n\nGas 434 148 186 100 480 168 215 97 \n\n                                                      \n\n2\n OECD+ includes all OECD countries plus non-OECD EU countries. \n\n3\n OME comprise Brazil, China, the Middle East and South Africa. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    12 \n\n \n\n 2010-2020 2021-2035 \n\nCCS-equiped* 4 4 1 0 173 104 69 1 \n\nNuclear 137 46 75 16 387 165 145 77 \n\nHydro 364 60 192 113 497 65 167 265 \n\nBiomass 73 44 17 12 234 80 89 65 \n\nWind-onshore 430 245 150 35 840 381 302 157 \n\nWind-offshore 67 42 20 4 298 170 91 36 \n\nSolar PV 123 81 21 21 652 238 233 181 \n\nConcentrating solar \n\npower \n\n39 18 11 9 185 75 68 42 \n\nGeothermal 12 5 1 5 35 13 7 15 \n\nMarine 1 1 - 0 19 17 1 1 \n\nTotal 2285 787 1047 451 4100 1522 1568 1010 \n\n* CCS-equipped capacity additions in the table may exceed the overall additions of the corresponding fuels as this table \n\nincludes plant retrofit. \n\n- CCS deployment \u2013 450 Scenario Requirements \n\nBy 2030, in comparison with the 450 Scenario published within the 2009 WEO, CCS in the 2010 IEA \n\n450 Scenario plays a further significant role in emission reduction (to the extent of 1.2 Gt more). In the \n\nlatter Scenario, CCS retrofit plays a larger role, particularly in China and the United States (IEA, \n\n2010b). This degree of CCS deployment involves a supplementary investement of $1.3 trillion of that \n\nwithin the  CPS in the 2010 to 2035 period, representing nearly 8% of the total investment required to \n\nachieve the 450 Scenario path. A large number of CCS projects take place in OECD+ countries, as the \n\nprice of CO2 in the power and industry sectors certifies it as feasible options subsequently to a period \n\nbetween 2010 and 2020 in which government investments to fund CCS demonstration projects amount \n\nto an average annual of $3.5 to $4 billion (IEA, 2010b).   \n\nShortly after 2020, subsequently the introduction of a CO2 price, CCS deployment extents to Other \n\nMajor Economies as well. By 2035, in OECD+, CCS technologies account for 25% of abatement or \n\n1.6 Gt of CO2 and in Other Major Economies accounts for 21% of abatement or 2 Gt of CO2 (IEA, \n\n2010b). \n\nIn order to achive this sum of abatement, extended international co-operation and financing for CCS \n\ndemonstration in developing countries is necessary, possibly through the Clean Development \n\nMechanism (CDM) or an alternative financing mechanism generating offset credits. The \n\nimplementation of legal and regulatory frameworks and systematic mapping of storage sites is also \n\nnecessary (IEA, 2010b).  \n\nThe benefits and main characteristics of EE, RES and Nuclear energy are briefly overviewed within \n\nthe following section. In the succeeding chapter, CCS technologies will be discussed in further detail \n\nin the context of the dissertation.  \n\n2.3 Energy Efficiency  \n\nBenefits of Energy Efficiency \n\nEnergy Efficiency (EE) was first considered by some surveyed companies as early as 1970 and the \n\naverage date for setting EE targets was 1998 (Hoffman, A.J., 2007). The history of EE is intimately \n\nbound up with the notions of progress, growth and power. Indeed, there is a continuous race between \n\nEE and economic growth. If the latter is faster than the rate of EE increase, then total energy \n\nconsumption increases, as it has been historically (Boyle G., 2003).   \n\nEE improvement is recognised by the International Community as an essential cost-effective \n\nrequirement to address energy sustainability concerns and to serve multiple proposes, such as: \n\n- Enhance energy security (reduce domestic demand and imported energy to maximize exports, \nincrease reliability and control energy demand growth); \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    13 \n\n \n\n- Boost economic development and competitiveness (reduce energy intensity, improve \nindustrial competitiveness, reduce production costs and achieve more affordable energy \n\ncustomer costs); \n\n- Reduce climate change (contribute to global mitigation and adaption efforts, meet \ninternational obligations under the UNFCCC); \n\n- Improve public health (reduce indoor and local pollution) (IEA, 2010c). \n\nEven if the global energy intensity has improved, at an average rate of 1.7% per year, since the early \n\n1970s, this enhancement must be measured against overall increases in energy consumption and CO2 \n\nemissions resulting from population and economic growth (IEA, 2011). \n\nEE improvements can be pursued in all conversion and end-use processes in the energy system and EE \n\ncan and should be enhanced worldwide, within all the different sectors ( IEA, 2011).  \n\nEnergy Efficiency opportunities by Sector  \n\nDecarbonizing the power and heat sector is critical in order to achieve deep CO2 emissions cuts and \n\none of the most important near-term approaches for reducing CO2 emissions from fossil-fired power \n\ngeneration is to improve the efficiency of new and existing plants. There are several solutions for \n\nmaximizing EE within the power and heat generation sector, for instance, through the adoption of the \n\nbest available technologies and the upgrading or replacement of older inefficient plants. This, along \n\nwith EE improvements within power transmission and distribution would result in important fossil \n\nfuel savings and CO2 emissions reduction and consequently increase the sustainability of the overall \n\nenergy sector.  \n\nPursuing EE improvements within residential, commercial and public-service buildings is also an issue \n\nof major importance since buildings account for close to 40% of energy used in most countries (IEA \n\nsite). The energy use in this sector includes space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting, \n\nappliances and cooking and business equipment (IEA, 2010b). Presently, space heating and cooling as \n\nwell as hot water are estimated to account for approximately half of global energy consumption in \n\nbuildings (IEA, 2011d). The largest technical potential for energy savings in residential, commercial \n\nand public-service buildings consists on EE building design, implemented together with efficient \n\nheating and cooling systems/equipment. For users and owners of buildings in general, EE measures \n\nare most often feasible, as savings pay for the additional investment costs over time. Within OECD \n\nand economies in transition, the low retirement rate of buildings and the relatively modest extension, \n\nimplies that most of the energy savings potential involves retrofitting and purchasing new technologies \n\nfor the prevailing building stock. In developing countries instead, where the construction expansion of \n\nnew building is expected, opportunities exist to secure significant energy savings through improved \n\nEE standards for new buildings (IEA, 2010d).   \n\nAs regards the industrial sector, it has achieved considerable EE improvements in the last decades, but \n\nthis progress pales beside the increased industrial production worldwide (IEA, 2010d). In fact, this \n\nsector is currently responsible for about one third of all the energy used worldwide and for almost 40% \n\nof global CO2 emissions. Therefore, reducing the CO2 intensity of the most widely produced \n\ncommodities such as cement, iron and steel, chemicals and petrochemicals, paper and paperboard and \n\naluminium by decoupling energy consumption from output via enhancing EE within the industrial \n\nfacilities and processes, and moving to best available technologies is necessary to reduce \n\nenvironmental problems (IEA, 2011e). \n\nAs to the transport sector, it is the second-largest CO2 emitter followed by industry and buildings \n\n(IEA, 2010b) and the highest energy final consumer and it is forecasted to remain so if no EE \n\nimprovements and additional measures are pursued. Accomplishing deep cuts in CO2 emissions in this \n\nsector will hinge on decelerating the increase in fuel transport use, by greater EE improvements and \n\nraising the share of low-carbon fuels (IEA, 2010d). In 2008 the IEA published EE recommendations \n\nfor the transport sector. These have focused on road transport and policies on improving EE of tires, \n\nfuel economy standards for both light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles, and eco-driving. Fiscal \n\nmeasures were not incorporated in the current IEA transport EE recommendations. However, financial \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    14 \n\n \n\nincentives or penalties would promote the purchase of more EE vehicles and therefore accelerate the \n\ndeployment of EE technologies.  \n\nBarriers to Energy Efficiency further deployment \n\nAbundant cost-effective EE potential is considered to be unexploited and EE can and should be \n\nenhanced across all sectors. Still, many EE projects with strong financial rates of returns remain \n\nunimplemented worldwide, but principally in developing and emerging countries. Indeed, despite the \n\npotential benefits, realizing EE improvements can be blocked by the following barriers: \n\n- Market: market organisation and price distortions impede customers from appraising the true \nvalue of EE; split incentive problems created when investors cannot capture the benefits of \n\nimproved efficiency; transaction costs (projections development costs are high relative to \n\nenergy savings); \n\n- Financial: up-front costs and dispersed benefits discourage investors; perception of EE \ninvestments as complex and risky, with high transaction costs; lack of awareness of financial \n\nbenefits on the part of financial institutions; \n\n- Information and awareness: lack of necessary information and understanding, on the \nconsumers side, to make rational consumption and investment decisions); \n\n- Regulatory and institutional: energy tariffs that discourage EE investment; incentive structures \nencourage energy providers to sell energy rather than invest in cost-effective EE, institutional \n\nbias towards supply-side investments; \n\n- Technical: privation of affordable EE technologies suitable to local conditions; unsatisfactory \ncapacity to identify, develop, implement and maintain EE investments (IEA, 2010c). \n\nPolicies to support Energy Efficiency \n\nIn order to address the previously mentioned barriers to EE development, several governments at all \n\nlevels have, over the years, introduced different policies, such as: \n\n- Pricing mechanisms: variable tariffs where higher consumption levels invoke higher unit \nprices; \n\n- Regulatory and control mechanisms: compulsory activities, such as energy audits and energy \nmanagement, minimum energy performance standards, energy consumption reduction targets, \n\nEE investment obligations on private companies; \n\n- Fiscal measures and tax incentives: grants, subsidies and tax incentives for EE investments, \ndirect procurement of EE goods and services; \n\n- Promotional and market transformation mechanisms: public information campaigns and \npromotions, inclusion of EE in school curricula, appliance labelling and building certification; \n\n- Technology development: development and demonstration of EE technologies; \n\n- Commercial development and capacity building: creation of energy service companies, \ntraining programmes, development of EE industry; \n\n- Financial remediation: revolving funds for EE investments, project preparation facilities, \ncontingent financing facilities (IEA, 2010c). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4 Renewable Energy \n\nBenefits of Renewable Energy \n\nThe Renewable Energy (RE) potential is wide and can supply a large portion of energy demand. RE \n\nsources derive directly or indirectly from natural processes connected to sunlight, heat stored in the \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    15 \n\n \n\nearth or gravitional forces and are continuously, naturally replenished (IEA, 2011f). The array of \n\nbenefits arising from the greater development and deployment of RE - within a portfolio of low-\n\ncarbon and cost-competitive energy technologies capable of responding to the emerging major \n\nchallenges of climate change, energy security, and access to energy - is well acknowledged and it has \n\nbecome a priority for both governments of IEA member countries and emerging economies. Indeed, \n\nmore than 70 governments around the world, including all IEA members, have already introduced \n\ntargets and policies to support the deployment of RE technologies (IEA, 2011g).  \n\nOverview of the main RES characteristics  \n\nSolar  \n\nSolar energy is categorically the most abundant energy resource available on earth. At the time there \n\nare three main technologies to harness the solar energy: solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating \n\nsolar power (CSP) to provide electricity, and solar thermal collectors for heating and cooling (IEA, \n\n2010b). \n\nPV systems are commercially available technologies that transform direct and diffused solar radiation \n\ninto electricity, by means of a photovoltaic process, using semi-conductor devices. PV systems can be \n\ndeployed anywhere in the world on apposite land and on houses. PV technology is very modular and \n\ncan be installed close to centres of demand. These technologies are, as well proper for off-grid \n\nelectrification. As solar PV is a variable source of power, its integration into the grid may be \n\nchallenging for system operators where it is used on a large scale. Conversely, peak production takes \n\nplace during the day, usually matching, in hot regions, with peak electricity demand, often driven by \n\nair conditioning loads (IEA, 2010b).  \n\nCSP is a proven technology that produces high-temperature heat for electricity generation or for co-\n\ngeneration of electricity and heat. CSP systems are only able to convert direct normal irradiation. \n\nTherefore, suitable areas for CSP deployment are those with strong sunshine and clear skies, \n\nfrequently arid or semi-arid areas. CSP technology opens up the prospect of thermal energy storage \n\nand hybrid designs, for instance, with natural gas co-firing. If equipped with adequate storage \n\ncapacity, CSP systems could provide base-load power (IEA, 2010b).  \n\nSolar thermal collectors produce heat from solar radiation, by heating a fluid that circulates through a \n\ncollector. Similar to PV panels, these systems are able to convert both direct and diffuse light and for \n\nthat reason can be installed anywhere in the world. The collectors produce comparatively low \n\ntemperature heat, apposite for space heating and hot water production in buildings and some lower \n\ntemperature industrial applications. Since solar thermal heat is not always available when needed, \n\nsolar thermal collectors are relatively inapt to replace other sources of heat, at least until inter-seasonal \n\nstorage becomes affordable. The potential of these technologies for industrial proposes is almost \n\nunexploited for the moment (IEA, 2010b). \n\nWind power   \n\nThe kinetic energy of wind is converted in wind turbines into electricity. Suitable wind speeds for \n\nelectricity generation (from 4 m/s to 25 m/s) are virtually attainable all over the world, with the \n\nexception of certain equatorial areas. Wind power is converted onshore and off-shore, where typically \n\nwind speeds are higher and the wind is available for longer periods of time. The distance from centres \n\nof demand onshore and water depth are key aspects for the deployment of these technologies off-\n\nshore. Similar to solar, wind is a variable source of power and the output increases and drops as wind \n\nstrength fluctuates. Therefore, integrating wind power into grids, particularly once wind becomes a \n\nmajor component of the total system, is challenging (IEA, 2010b). \n\n \n\nHydropower \n\nHydropower uses the potential energy of water and converts it into electricity, either in run-of-river \n\nplants or reservoirs. Hydropower is the most mature renewable energy technology and can be explored \n\nalmost all over world. In the OECD countries the most suitable areas, particularly for large hydro, \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    16 \n\n \n\nhave been explored by now, but there is still potential for small-scale developments unexploited. \n\nSignificant potential for hydro generation still exists in Asia, Latin America and Africa.   \n\nSome hydro plants can be operated as base load, while others serve as peaking plants, depending on \n\nthe volume of the reservoirs and the electrical capacity of the dam relative to the total system; \n\nhydropower plants can be operated flexibly, particularly where pumped storage is available, and hence \n\nare capable to supply sudden fluctuations in power demand (IEA, 2010b).  \n\nBiomass \n\nBiomass energy is produced from any organic material, of plant and animal origin, derived from \n\nagriculture and forestry production and resulting by-products, and industrial and urban wastes (OECD, \n\n2004). The type of technologies exploiting biomass resources is very varied and the selection of \n\ntechnology depends on both the final use and on the nature of the biomass feedstock (IEA, 2010b). \n\nThe potential of this resource can be assessed, based on the land availability for dedicated crops and \n\nthe availability forestry and agricultural residues and waste. The availability of land for crops and \n\nwater use are major concerns of biomass exploitation (IEA, 2010b). \n\nGeothermal energy  \n\nGeothermal energy is the energy available as heat contained in or discharged from the earth?s crust \n\nthat can be exploited for power generation or for direct heat within a number of applications such as: \n\nspace and district heating, water heating, aquaculture and industrial processes. Moderate or high \n\ntemperatures geothermal resources are suitable for power generation. High-temperature geothermal \n\nresources usually exist in areas near plate boundaries or rift zones. If the temperature level is too low \n\nfor power production, geothermal heat resources can be exploited for direct use in district heating \n\nsystems and for some industrial and agricultural purposes, where local markets exist. Some of the \n\npositive features of this resource include the capability to provide base load power, the compatibility \n\nwith both centralized and distributed energy generation; sources of low temperature geothermal heat \n\nexist in all over the world. The high capital cost, and the fact that exploited geothermal reservoirs \n\nrequire continuous management are some of the barriers for further exploitation of this resource (IEA, \n\n2010b).  \n\nMarine power \n\nMarine energy technologies use the kinetic energy of tides, waves and currents of the sea, as well as \n\ntemperature and salinity gradients, for the power generation. The technologies to exploit this resource \n\nare the least developed of the renewable energy technologies. This marine energy resource is, in \n\nprinciple, limitless and can be found in all world regions, but in practice it is only viable at sites close \n\nto demand centres and where, simultaneously, damage to local ecosystems can be controlled. Some \n\nmarine technologies such as those that exploit tides have variable output, but on the other hand they \n\nare predictable (IEA, 2010b). \n\nRE share in the TPES  \n\nDuring the last decade, the policy support for RE has increased considerably, mainly due to the \n\nnecessity to reduce the GHG emission, to diversify the supply mix and to reduce the dependence on \n\nimported fossil fuels. Between 2000 and 2008 the total primary renewable energy supply grew from \n\n1319 Mtoe to 1590 Mtoe (IEA, 2010b).  \n\nBiomass is currently the most exploited source of RE. In 2008 biomass use amounted to 1225 Mtoe, \n\nmost of which was exploited in developing countries, in traditional ways by around 2.7 billion people. \n\nThe use of modern biomass (refers to all biomass with the exception of traditional biomass, which \n\nrefers to the biomass consumption within the residential sector in developing countries and includes \n\nthe use of charcoal, agricultural residues and animal dung for cooling and heating) is lesser (amounted \n\nto 478 Mtoe in 2008), but is rapidly increasing, mainly for electricity generation and as feedstock for \n\nmaking transport fuels. Hydropower is, currently, the second largest RE source in primary energy \n\ndemand (accounted for 276 Mtoe in 2008) and the dominant source of renewables-based electricity. \n\nSolar, wind, geothermal and marine power have been developing rapidly in recent years, but their total \n\nshare within primary energy supplies is still modest (IEA, 2010b).  \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    17 \n\n \n\nElectricity generation based on RE augmented by almost a third from 2000 to 2008. However, in \n\nabsolute terms, this increase is offset by the escalation of fossil fuels based power generation (IEA, \n\n2010b).  \n\nIn the OECD region, electricity generation based on RE increased more than that based on coal within \n\nthe same period, but much less than natural gas generation whereas, in non-OECD countries the \n\nincrease in electricity generation based on RE was slightly lower than the corresponding increase from \n\ngas, but much lower than that from coal (IEA, 2010b).  \n\nIn 2008 RE supplied almost 3800 TWh worldwide, 19% of total electricity production. Globally, \n\nelectricity based on RE increased by approximately 900 TWh. Even if this upsurge is mainly \n\nattributable to hydropower (responsible for 85% of RE based electricity in 2008), new forms of RE \n\ngrew very quickly, particularly wind power, which expanded seven-fold. During the same period, \n\nsolar PV electricity generation grew 16-fold. Biomass and geothermal power both increased as well, \n\nbut at a modest pace, while marine power and CSP are just now starting to take-off (IEA, 2010b).  \n\nAs government policies to support renewables tend to focus more on electricity and transport, the \n\ndevelopment of RE for heat production at the point of use (and heat from district heating systems) was \n\nmuch more modest. Despite efforts to increase the access to modern fuels for underprivileged, the use \n\nof traditional biomass has increased since 2000 (IEA, 2010b). \n\nBiofuels are supplying a growing share of transport fuels and the global use of biofuels, consumed \n\nalmost entirely within road transport, increased five-fold in the 2000 to 2008 period, reaching 1 mb/d \n\nand supplying almost 3% of total fuel demand in road transport. In 2009, biofuels use continued \n\nincrease, as production capacity expanded (encouraged in most countries by government support), \n\nwhereas oil demand for road transport decreased (for the first time since 1980) owing to higher prices \n\nand reduced economic activity (IEA, 2010b). \n\nBarriers to RE further deployment \n\nDespite progress, many challenges still need to be overcome in order to sustain the necessary growth \n\nof RE. Currently, most of the RE technologies are not able to compete with conventional ones since \n\nthese are comparatively less capital-intensive. Therefore, it is of decisive importance to improve the \n\npolicy framework for RE in order to bridge the competitiveness gap between RE and traditional \n\nalternative energy technologies. A continuous effort in research, development and deployment for RE \n\ntechnologies is also necessary to increase productivity and decrease costs (IEA, 2011f).  \n\nThe expansion of renewables raises significant system integration issues that must be taken into \n\naccount. Some options and technologies, including smart grids, exist so as to increase the flexibility of \n\nelectricity systems and to allow the integration of greater shares of variable renewable electricity (IEA, \n\n2011f).  \n\n2.5 Nuclear Power  \n\nThe nuclear power was first demonstrated in the 1950s and in the early 1960s the first commercial \n\nnuclear power plants entered operation. Within the 1970s and 1980s, nuclear power capacity raised \n\nspeedily as nations sought to decrease fossil fuel dependence, particularly after the 1970s oil crisis \n\n(IEA, 2010f).  \n\nBenefits of Nuclear Power \n\nNuclear power presents the potential to play an important role for decarbonizing the power sector and \n\nenhance energy security since it has the capability to deliver substantial amounts of very low carbon \n\nbaseload electricity at costs stable over time (IEA, 2010e). Indeed, the indirect emissions of nuclear \n\npower plants are at least of an order of magnitude below the emissions of fossil fuels (NEA, 2009). \n\nNuclear energy is at a very different stage of technological development and deployment than most \n\nother low-carbon energy options and is considered an established mature technology as a result of over \n\n50 years of development and operational experience. The newest projects for nuclear power plants, \n\nnow under consideration, integrate the knowledge acquired over the years as well as the recent \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    18 \n\n \n\ntechnological developments to enhance safety and performance (IEA, 2010f). Still, further \ndevelopment of reactor and fuel cycle technologies will be important if nuclear energy is to achieve its \n\nfull potential. \n\nBarriers for Nuclear Power further deployment  \n\nThe barriers to a wider nuclear deployment in the short to medium term are predominantly policy, \n\nindustrial and financial-related. In the long term, the potential of nuclear power will depend in \n\nuranium resources availability (IPCC, 2007). \n\nThe construction of a nuclear power plant involves a large capital investment (IEA, 2010f). \n\nGovernments aiming to increase nuclear capacity are required to provide support for financing new \n\nnuclear construction. When in operation a nuclear power plant entails comparatively small and \n\npredictable fuel, operating and maintenance costs which means that nuclear plants have low marginal \n\ncosts of production, but require several years to recover their capital costs (IEA, 2010f). This \n\nintensifies the risks of electricity and carbon markets uncertainty and implies that a sustained \n\ngovernment policy support is a prerequisite for a successful nuclear programme.  \n\nThe technical complexity of construction and operation of a nuclear power plant also represents a \n\nsignificant downside (IEA, 2010f). \n\nEven if concerns about security of energy supply and climate change have tended, in recent years to \n\nincrease the general recognition of the benefits of nuclear energy, several factors weaken public \n\nsupport in many countries. These include concerns about nuclear safety, radioactive waste \n\nmanagement and disposal, and the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons.    \n\nIn the operation of nuclear power plants, safety should always be the principal consideration, not only \n\nin terms of technical or ageing issues, but also in terms of management system and qualified \n\nworkforce related issues. Application of an integrated management system and structured workforce \n\nplanning are needed throughout the plant life in order to guarantee effective plant organization and \n\nmanagement. Plant operators and regulators must always make sure that plant safety is preserved and, \n\nwhere possible, enhanced during its operating lifetime. \n\nNuclear power in the TPES \n\nIn the 1990s, with the exception of Japan and Korea, nuclear growth stagnated worldwide (IEA, \n\n2010f). Reasons for this involved safety concerns subsequent to the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl \n\naccidents, delays and higher costs than expected at some nuclear plants, and a return to inferior fossil \n\nfuel prices (IEA, 2010f).  \n\nWithin recent years nuclear power progression has remained nearly flat with global operational \n\ninstalled capacity going from 370 GW at the end of 2005 to 375 GW by the end of 2010 (IEA, 2010f) \n\n(IEA, 2011). This modest growth reflects the low number of new projects construction realized during \n\nthe past two decades. Still, most large energy consuming countries have, in recent years, at least \n\nconsidered a nuclear program to meet future energy needs.  However, the March 2011 major accident \n\nwithin the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan that resulted from a severe earthquake and \n\ntsunami, led many countries to review the safety of their existing and planned nuclear plants projects. \n\nThis tragic event real impact on nuclear installed capacity development is currently uncertain (IEA, \n\n2011).  \n\nNuclear fusion  \n\nEnergy from the fusion of heavy hydrogen fuel is actively being pursued as a long-term almost \n\ninexhaustible, environmentally benign, supply of energy. The scientific feasibility of fusion energy \n\nhas been proven but technical feasibility remains to be demonstrated (IPCC, 2007). Fusion scientists \n\nfrom the European Union, India, China, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States are now \n\nproceeding with the construction of a 500MW experimental thermal power plant (IEA, 2011k). \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    19 \n\n \n\n \n\n3 CCS technologies \n\nAs discussed in the preceding item, the degree to which CCS may contribute to the reduction of  GHG \n\nemissions, globally and in specific countries in the coming decades, depends on the interplay of many \n\nfactors including the character of climate change objectives, the further development of CCS \n\ntechnology, the relative costs and benefits of alternative abatement approaches, and explicit political \n\nand policy choices.   \n\nHowever, and as demonstrated in the previous chapter, one thing is certain: CCS technologies have the \n\npotential to play a crucial role in the world?s response to climate change, by decarbonizing on large \n\nscale the energy sector and other industrial activities. As such, together with EE and RE, CCS features \n\nin all of the IEA carbon abatement scenarios.  \n\nEven if the benefits of CCS are well acknowledged, as a result of its complex nature, CCS \n\ntechnologies still face substantial technical, legal, regulatory, environmental, public acceptance, and \n\neconomic barriers to its widespread deployment (ICF, 2010). \n\nCCS Process Chain \n\nCCS entails a number of technologies and consists of the separation of the CO2 from large point \n\nsources, the transportation of the CO2 to a storage location and its long-term isolation from the \n\natmosphere.  \n\nLarge point sources of CO2 consist of, among others, large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities, \n\nmajor CO2 emitting industries, natural gas production, synthetic fuel plants and fossil fuel based H2 \n\nproduction plants (IPCC, 2005).   \n\nDepending on the process application, there are three major approaches for capturing the CO2 within \n\nthe above mentioned facilities: post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion.  \n\nThe CO2 captured, after compression (or liquefation) may, potentially, be transported (generally via \n\npipeline) for storage  in geological formations (such as oil and gas fields, unminable coal beds and \n\ndeep saline formations\n4\n), in the ocean (direct release into the ocean water column or onto the deep \n\nseafloor), in mineral carbonates\n5\n, or for use in industrial processes (IPCC, 2005).   \n\nThe purpose of the following paragraphs is to provide an overview of the CCS technologies process \n\nchain and its possible applications.  \n\n3.1 CO2 Capture  \n\nThe goal of CO2 capture technologies is to achieve a concentrated stream of CO2 prepared to be \n\ntransported to a storage site. Indeed, the implementation of CO2 capture technologies, within most \n\nindustrial activities that make use of boilers, turbines, iron and steel furnaces or cement kilns, requires \n\na step to convert a relatively dilute stream of CO2 to a higher concentration so as to allow economic \n\ntransportation and storage. In the above mentioned applications, concentrations of CO2 in exhaust gas \n\nstreams range from around 3-20% CO2, which typically need to be concentrated to >85% prior to \n\ncompression, transport and storage.  \n\n                                                      \n\n4\n Saline formations are sedimentary rocks saturated with formation waters containing high concentrations of \n\ndissolved salts. They are widespread and contain enormous quantities of water that are unsuitable for agriculture \n\nor human consumption. Because the use of geothermal energy is likely to increase, potential geothermal areas \n\nmay not be suitable for CO2 storage. \n5\n Storage of CO2 as mineral carbonates does not cover deep geological carbonation or ocean storage with \n\nenhanced carbonate neutralization. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    20 \n\n \n\nCO2 capture technologies have been recurrently used in some industrial processes such as natural gas \n\nproduction, where CO2 is removed from the natural gas stream, during processing, to achieve specific \n\nnatural gas quality standards. Similar procedures occur in plants that produce ammonia or H2 for \n\nprocess purposes (IPCC, 2005). However, within the power sector, capturing CO2 is still an emerging \n\ntechnology (not demonstrated on a commercial scale). \n\nAs previously mentioned, there are three main technologies available for capturing the CO2 from \n\npower plants and other industrial facilities: \n\n- Post-combustion - technologies that separate the CO2 from the flue gases produced by the \ncombustion of a primary fuel (coal, natural gas, oil or biomass) with air (process described in \n\nsection 3.1.1); \n\n- Oxy-fuel combustion - technologies that replace air for O2 in combustion, in order to produce \na flue gas that is mainly composed of H2O and CO2 which may be readily captured (process \n\ndescribed in section 3.1.2); and \n\n- Pre-combustion - technologies that process the primary fuel in a reactor to produce separate \nstreams of CO2 and H2 (process described in section 3.1.3) (IPCC, 2005).     \n\nEach of the above approaches involves the separation of CO2 from a gas stream and there are five \n\nmain methods available for doing so, depending on the CO2 (i.e. concentration, pressure, volume) to \n\nbe captured: \n\n? Chemical solvent scrubbing; \n\n? Physical solvent scrubbing; \n\n? Adsorption/desorption; \n\n? Membrane separation; \n\n? Cryogenic separation (GCI, 2011). \n\n \n\nChemical/Physical Absorption  \n\nCO2 capture systems may be based on chemical absorption (using sovents such as MEA, \n\nMonoethanolamine), or on  physical absorption (using solvents such as Selexol, Dimethylether of \n\npolyethylene glycol) (IEA, 2004).  Once the CO2 is scrubbed from the raw gas, the saturated solution \n\nmust be regenerated and the CO2 extracted. The bonding energy, between the solvent and CO2, \n\ninvolved in physical absorption is lower than that of chemical absorption, which is an advantage when \n\nit comes to regeneration. Chemical absorption processes involve a heat induced CO2 recovery, \n\nwhereas physical absorption processes involve pressure induced CO2 recovery (IEA, 2004). Chemical \n\nabsorption is considered a better option at low CO2 concentration because its energy use is not \n\nparticularly sensitive at low concentrations and low partial pressures of CO2. Phsyical absorption is the \n\npreferred option at higher CO2 concentrations and at higher partial pressures (IEA, 2004). These \n\nmethods are  industrially established capture techniques. \n\nAdsorption/desorption  \n\nAdsorption is a physical process that involves the attachment of a gas or liquid to a solid surface. The \n\nregeneration of the adsorbent may be achieved by the application of heat (temperature swing \n\nadsorption, TSA) the reduction of pressure (pressure swing adsorption, PSA) or by a mix process of \n\npressure and temperature swing adsorption (PTSA) (Wang, et al. 2010) (RECCS, 2008). Adsorbents \n\nwhich can be applied to CO2 capture include activated carbon, alumina, metallic oxides and zeolites \n\n(Wang, et al. 2010). Current adsorption systems may not be suitable for application in large-scale \n\npower plant flue gas treatment. At such scale, the low adsorption capacity of most available adsorbents \n\nmay pose significant challenges. In addition, the flue gas streams to be treated must have high CO2 \n\nconcentrations because of the generally low selectivity of most available adsorbents (Wang, et al. \n\n2010). \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    21 \n\n \n\n \n\nMembrane Separation  \n\nIn a membrane based separation, selectivity is provided by the membranes themselves. Membranes \n\ninclude polymeric materials, metals or ceramics. Efficient separation demands high selectivity, a large \n\nmembrane surface and high permeability for the desired gas components in comparison with the other \n\ngases in the mixture. This method is currently under development and is not yet state of the art. Today \n\nmembranes are used for gas separation on a small scale. They are especially efficient for separating \n\ngases with very different sized molecules (RECCS, 2008). \n\nCryogenic Distillation (Separation)  \n\nBy cooling at pressures as low as 4-5 bar, CO2 can be condensed out of gas mixtures. The gas mixture \n\nmust be previously dried. This physical process is suitable for treating flue gas streams with high CO2 \n\nconcentrations considering the costs of refrigeration (RECCS, 2008). The procedure is energy-\n\nintensive, particularly when the concentration of CO2 is low. But capture and compression for \n\ntransport are accomplished in a sole stage. By now this method is used for conditioning biogas, but no \n\nexperience has yet been gathered in the power station sector (RECCS, 2008). This technique is \n\nfrequently associated to oxy-fuel CO2 capture processes (process described in section 3.1.2). \n\nWithin the following section the post-combustion, oxy-fuel capture and pre-combustion techniques are \n\nbriefly revised.  \n\n3.1.1 Post-combustion CO2 Capture  \n\nIn this process, the CO2 is captured from a flue gas at low pressure (1 bar) and low CO2 content (3-\n\n20%), in general (Le Thiez, P. 2005). Post-combustion capture technologies may be applied, in \n\nconcept, to the flue gases from the combustion of all types of fuel. Still, the fuel impurities are \n\ndecisive in the design and costing of the complete plant. The separation task is to remove CO2 from a \n\nmixture of mainly nitrogen and O2 (Le Thiez, P. 2005). There are several options for separating the \n\nCO2 from this gas mixture by post-combustion CO2 capture techniques. Nonetheless, several \n\nassessment comparative studies suggest that, currently, the absorption process based on chemical \n\nsolvents is the most suitable option for post-combustion CO2 capture and absorption practices are now \n\ncommercially available for post-combustion CO2 capture systems, although not yet on the necessary \n\nscale for power plant flue gases (IPCC, 2005).   \n\nIn a power plant, with an absorption-based CO2 capture process the flue gas is to be brought into \n\ncontact with a chemical absorbent inside a scrubber column. Flue gases to the CO2 absorber must be \n\ncooled to improve the absorption of CO2 and minimize solvent losses due to evaporation (Wang, et al. \n\n2010).  \n\nTypical absorbents that are used today are amines and carbonates. Amines are able to capture CO2 \n\nfrom streams with a low CO2 partial pressure and form water soluble compounds. Thus, amine-based \n\nsystems are able to recover CO2 from the flue gas of conventional pulverized coal (PC) fired power \n\nplants, however only at a significant cost and efficiency penalty (Figueroa, et al. 2007). On the other \n\nhand Carbonate systems are based on the capacity of a soluble carbonate to react with CO2 and form \n\nbicarbonate, which when heated, releases CO2 and reverts to a carbonate. An advantage of carbonates \n\nover amine-based systems is the significantly lower energy required for regeneration (Figueroa, et al. \n\n2007).  \n\nPreceding the absorption process, other acid gases such as SO2 and NO2 need to be removed as they \n\ndiminish the performance of the system by forming heat stable salts with solvent such as MEA. SO2 \n\nremoval is frequently attained in a Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) unit. SO2 concentrations of less \n\nthan 10 ppm are recommended. NOx is removed by Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective \n\nNoncatalytic Reduction (SCNR) or low NOx burners. Particulate matter such as fly ash needs to be \n\nremoved by electrostatic precipitators (ESP) or bag house filters otherwise they would cause foaming \n\nin the absorber and regenerator columns reducing their performance (Wang, et al. 2010). \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    22 \n\n \n\nAfter the absorption process, the absorbent and the CO2 are separated in a regeneration column (the \n\nCO2 loaded absorbent is heated which has the effect of both freeing the CO2 and also cleaning the \n\nabsorbent to allow it to be re-used). The result is then a stream of pure CO2 and a second stream of \n\nabsorbent that can be recycled to the scrubber column. By using this method, around 90% of the CO2 \n\nis captured, with the CO2 stream having a very high purity \u2013 of around 99% (EON, 2008). \n\nThe CO2 is then dried to remove any excess water and then it is prepared for transportation and \n\neventual storage (EON, 2008).  \n\nAlthough amine-based today is the most mature technology for post-combustion CO2 capture, \n\nammonia-based solvents are considered a potentially attractive alternative (IEA, 2011b). \n\nAlternatively post-combustion CO2 capture can also be performed by adsorption instead of absorption \n\nor by a membrane module but today, absorption is the most mature technology.  \n\nA key advantage of this technology (post-combustion CO2 capture method) is that it can be retrofitted \n\nto existing power stations and that it is already in use in a wide range of processes around the world \n\nTable 3-1. \n\nTable 3-1 \u2013 Overview of the advantages and disadvantages of post-combustion CO2 capture \n\ntechnologies (EON, 2011) \n\nStrengths Weaknesses \n\nGood prospects for retrofiting Reduces thermal efficiency and significantly increases \n\noperating costs \n\nRobust process with only limited impact on plant \n\navailability \n\nCapture equipment requires considerable additional \n\nspace and cooling water \n\nSignificant potential for technical optimization Large amounts of chemicals must be handled \n\nEnergy required for carbon capture can be offset by \n\nadvances in the thermal efficiency of conventional \n\ngeneration \n\nOnly limited experience worldwide with capturing \n\ncarbon from the flue gas of coal-fired plants \n\nFlexible operating characteristics \n\nHigh degree of CO2 purity (>99.5%) \n\nCommercial rollout likely by 2020 \n\nCan be used in conventional power plants worldwide \n\nSeveral equipment suppliers conducting R&amp;D \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Oxy-fuel CO2 Capture  \n\nIn this process the fuel combustion - coal, natural gas oil or biomass \u2013 occurs in either pure O2 or a \n\nmixture of pure O2 and a CO2-rich recycled flue gas. The resulting flue gas contains mainly CO2 and \n\nwater vapour and excess O2 (required assuring the fuel complete combustion). These two main \n\ncomponents are easily separated through cooling, the water condenses and a CO2 rich gas-stream is \n\nformed.  \n\nThe great advantage of the oxy-fuel CO2 capture technique is that a capture rate of 97% is possible, \n\ntogether with a purity of 99.9%. The purity of the CO2 captured depends on the purity of the fuel and \n\nO2 supplied the level of air in-leakage in the boiler, the process design and the intensity of purification \n\n(IEA, 2011b). \n\nO2 is the key requirement for any oxy-fuel combustion system (IPCC, 2005) and existing methods of \n\nO2 production from air separation include cryogenic distillation, adsorption using multi-bed pressure \n\nswing units and polymeric membranes. These process economic aspects depend on the required O2 \n\nquantities. For all the large applications, such as power station boilers, cryogenic air separation is the \n\nonly economic viable solution (IPCC, 2005).    \n\nEven if oxy-fuel combustion technologies components are well established in the aluminium, iron and \n\nsteel and glass melting industries today, oxy fuel combustion with CO2 storage is currently in the \n\ndemonstration phase.

This pilot project in western \n\nGermany is owned by the European energy company, Vattenfall, and it is effectively demonstrating \n\nthe capture of CO2 emissions with a purity of over 99% (NGC, 2011).  \n\nTable 3-2 - Overview of the advantages and disadvantages of oxy-fuel combustion \ntechnologies (EON, 2011) \n\nStrengths Weaknesses \n\nIncorporation known, commonly used technologies and \n\nprocess \n\nSeparation of air into pure O2 and CO2 scrubbing are \n\nenergy intensive \n\nModification to power plants are primarily required on \n\nthe flue gas side; the water and steam cycle remains \n\nunchanged \n\nComparatively low CO2 purity; achieving higher levels of \n\npurity requires significantly more energy \n\nNo solvents needed Development phase would require complete pilot and \n\ndemonstration power plants \n\nComparatively little space required for additional \n\nequipment at power plant side \n\nLimited operational flexibility \n\n3.1.3 Pre-Combustion CO2 Capture  \n\nWith a pre-combustion technology, CO2 is to be captured before the combustion of the fuel. In this \n\nprocess CO2 is captured from a gas mixture with predominantly H2 gas at high pressure and medium \n\nCO2 content. Pre-combustion capture technologies can be applied to different feedstocks such as coal, \n\nnatural gas, biomass and waste (IEA, 2008).  This technique is currently in commercial operation for \n\ndifferent applications such as H2, ammonia and syngas production.  \n\nA pre-combustion capture system usually includes a first stage of reaction intended to produce a \n\nmixture of H2 and CO (syngas) from a primary fuel (IPCC, 2005). This conversion can be done \n\nthrough gasification, partial oxidation or steam reforming technology. Gasification is most often used \n\nfor solid fuels, partial oxidation for liquids, and steam reforming for gases (CCS 101).  \n\nThe CO is then converted into CO2 through a shift conversion process which also produces a stream of \n\nH2. To separate the produced H2 from the CO2, the mixture undergoes a gas clean. This gas clean up \n\nstep is frequently obtained using similar methods employed for post-combustion processes (for e.g.: \nchemical absorption with solvents including MEA, using heat induced CO2 recovery, or physical \n\nabsorption using solvents including Selexol with pressure induced CO2 recovery), although there are \n\nadvantages to removing the CO2 from the syngas mainly associated with the pressure of the gas, which \n\ndecreases compression energy requirements (CCC, 2010) (Stephens, J., 2005). The H2 - a valuable by-\n\nproduct of pre-combustion \u2013 may, among other utilities, be used as a fuel for power generation (CCS \n\n101) \n\nPre-combustion CO2 capture technologies are particularly relevent for coal based plants with \n\nintegrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) as IGCC power plants can offer a low-cost high \n\nefficiency pre-combustion CO2 capture platform (ADB, 2011). \n\nWithin an IGCC technology, before the syngas goes to the gas turbine to generate power, pre-\n\ncombustion processes can be incorporated to separate and capture CO2. However, CO2 capture \n\nimplementation to an IGCC power plant do not involve a simple end-of pipe modification since it \n\nimplies not only the additional CO2 capture equipment but changes in other components are also \n\nrequired. The syngas CO2 remotion prior to combustion changes the composition of the gas to be \n\nburned, increasing the H2 content, which alters the design requirements for the gas turbine. \n\nFurthermore, the CO2 capture process increases complexity to the optimal design of desulphurization \n\nand other gas clean-up processes and deepens both energy consumption and the amount of coal \n\nnecessary to generate the same amount of electricity (Stephens, 2005). \n\n \n\nhttp://www.vattenfall.com/en/ccs/index.htm\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    24 \n\n \n\nTable 3-3 - Overview of the advantages and disadvantages of pre-combustion technologies \n(EON, 2011) (Figueroa, et al. 2007) \n\nStrengths  Weaknesses \n\nCapturing CO2 from the CO2-H2 mixture is, due to \n\nhigher pressure and the partial pressure of the CO2, \n\neasier than capturing it from the flue gas after \n\ncombustion \n\nComplex equipment with many individual processes \n\nMost advanced capture technology Unsuitable for retrofit onto, and only limited \n\nsimilarities with, existing conventional power plants; \n\napplicable mainly to new plants, as few gasification \n\nplants are currently in operation \n\nLow overall emissions, low fresh-water consumption, \n\nand high CO2 purity \n\nImproved thermal efficiency only possible through \n\ngreater plant complexity \n\nH2 can be used in other applications or stored Highly complex systems limit operational flexibility \n\n3.2 Power Plants and CCS  \n\nSince capturing CO2 is still an emerging technology within the power sector, not yet demonstrated on \n\na commercial scale, current performance and cost information related to CCS from power generation \n\nis limited to estimates from engineering studies and pilot projects (IEA, 2011b).   \n\nFor coal-fired power generation, no single CO2 capture technology appears to outperform available \n\nalternative capture processes in terms of performance and costs. For natural gas-fired power plants, \n\npost-combustion CO2 capture is the option most predominantly considered across studies and appears \n\nto be the most attractive near-term option for NGCC (IEA, 2011b). \n\nCompared to coal and natural gas-fired plants, information regarding biomass fired power generation \n\nwith CO2 capture is even scarcer (IEA, 2011b). However, solid biomass as a fuel is similar in many \n\nways to coal, and the combustion technologies are, for that reason, similar (IEA, 2008). Thus, the CCS \n\nstrategies that are being developed for coal could also be applied to biomass. In fact, biomass \n\ncombination with CCS would outcome in a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere which may \n\nbecome an important option for a rapid reduction of CO2 emissions (IEA, 2008).   \n\n3.2.1 Power Plants - CCS Tehcnologies Performance and Efficiency Penalties  \n\nThe power plants perfomance with CO2 capture technologies can be summarized in terms of plants \n\nefficiency, power output and CO2 emissions. \n\nTable 3-4 summarizes power generation performance data with and without CO2 capture technologies \n\n(average OECD results). This data from the working paper \u201cCost and Performance of Carbon Dioxide \n\nCapture from Power Generation\u201d from the IEA is based on estimates published over 5 years in major \n\nengineering studies from about 50 CO2 capture installations at power plants.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable  3-4 - Power generation performance (IEA, 2011b) \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    25 \n\n \n\n  \n Post-combustion \n\ncapture from coal-\n\nfired power \n\ngeneration by amines \n\nPost-combustion \n\ncapture from natural \n\ngas-fired generation \n\nOxy-combustion \n\nfrom coal-fired \n\npower generation \n\nPre-combustion \n\ncapture from IGCC \n\nNet power output \n\nwithout capture (MW) \n\n582 528 566 633 \n\nNet power output with \n\ncapture (MW) \n\n545 461 543 546 \n\nNet efficiency without \n\ncapture, LHV (%) \n\n41.4 56.6 41.6 41.4 \n\nNet efficiency with \n\ncapture, LHV (%) \n\n30.9 48.4 31.9 33.1 \n\nCO2 emissions without \n\ncapture (kg/MWh) \n\n820 370 825 793 \n\nCO2 emissions with \n\ncapture (kg/MWh) \n\n111 55 59 115 \n\nRelative decrease in net \n\nefficiency (%) \n\n25 15 23 20 \n\n \n\nDepending on the fuel and technology used for combustion, the energy required to operate CO2 \n\ncapture technologies decreases the global efficiency of power generation and other processes. This \n\nleads to enlarged fuel supplies, enlarged quantities of waste and CO2 emissions production per unit of \n\nelectricity output.  \n\nAverage net efficiency penalties for post-combustion and oxy-combustion capture are 10% points \n\nrelative to a pulverised coal plant without capture, and 8% points for pre-combustion capture \n\ncompared to an IGCC (IEA, 2011b).  \n\nFor post-combustion CO2 capture from NGCC performance projections include net efficiency \n\npenalties of 8% points (IEA, 2011b).  \n\nThe reduction of energy requirements for CO2 capture and efficiency improvements in the energy \n\nconversion processes are considered critical for upcoming technology development in order to reduce \n\noverall environmental impacts and costs. \n\n3.2.2 Power Plants - Retrofitting with CCS technologies  \n\nCO2 capture technologies can be applied in new power plants or they can be retrofitted to existing \n\nplants. Two possibilities for retrofitting CO2 capture in an existing coal-fired power station are post-\n\ncombustion CO2 capture from the flue gas, e.g. by means of MEA scrubbing and converting the \n\ncombustion process to use pure O2 (oxy-fuel combustion) (RECCS, 2008). \n\nRetrofitting entails some drawbacks since there may be site restrictions and limited land for capture \n\nequipment; a long remaining plant life may be required to vindicate the large expense of installing \n\ncapture equipment; old plants often have low energy efficiencies and the installation of CO2 capture \n\ntechnologies will have a proportionally larger impact on the net output than in high efficiency plants \n\n(IPCC, 2005).    \n\nIn order to reduce the site constraints, new power plants could be projected \u201ccapture-ready\u201d, that is, \n\nwith sufficient space and facilities available for latter on simpler installation of CO2 capture \n\nequipment. Retrofits require case-by-case careful design-based examination. For particular types of \n\ncapture retrofit such as pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion much of the required retrofit \n\nequipment could be installed in a separate site if needed (IPCC, 2005).    \n\nThe other constraints could be largely reduced by upgrading or considerably rebuilding the existing \n\nplant when capture is retrofitted. In fact, old inefficient boilers and steam turbines could be substituted \n\nby modern, high efficiency supercritical boilers and turbines or IGCC plants. As the efficiencies of \n\npower generation equipment are improving, the efficiency of the retrofitted plant with CO2 capture \n\ncould be as high as that of the plant without capture (IPCC, 2005).   \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    26 \n\n \n\n3.3 CCS Technologies Applications beyond the Power Sector  \n\nCO2 emissions associated to industrial energy use are expected to further grow in the next decades. \n\nThe CO2 emitting processes within industry are varied and so are the alternatives to reduce emissions, \n\nat the present and in the future. However, for achieving deep CO2 emission reductions, industry is \n\nconsidered to have fewer alternatives to CCS than the power sector (UNIDO, 2010). Indeed, in many \n\nindustry sectors, CCS is the only technology, with the exception of EE improvements, that allows for \n\nsignificant cuts in CO2 emissions (IEA, 2011j).  \n\nEven if the majority of the short-term and cost-effective potential for CCS lies within the industrial \n\nsources of CO2, most of the studies on the potential application of CCS have focused on the power \n\nsector, in particular coal-fired power plants applications. However, if CCS is to fulfil its potential and \n\nmake the maximum contribution to the required emission reductions, this unevenness must be \n\naddressed (UNIDO, 2010).  \n\nThe deployment of CCS in industry entails several analogous challenges as those associated to the \n\npower sector. Unproven technology in some cases, increased energy use and the price of novel \n\ntechnology will inhibit many projects (UNIDO, 2010).   \n\nIn their report to the Muskoka 2010 G8 Summit, the IEA and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership \n\nForum in partnership with the Global CCS Institute have called for the identification of a larger \n\nnumber of projects in industrial sectors and assistance for the development of CCS in developing \n\ncountries (UNIDO, 2010).   \n\nIn industry, CCS is currently considered a valuable solution for CO2 emission reduction within: \n\n- Industries that vent high-purity CO2 into the atmosphere. These sources of CO2 are relatively \ncost-effective to capture and could therefore embody early opportunities for CCS to be \n\ndemonstrated;  \n\n- CO2 intensive industries where CO2 emissions are inherent to industrial processes, where it is \ntechnical and economically more difficult to reduce these emissions than in other sectors and \n\nwhere CCS becomes one of the only options for large scale emissions reductions as it is for \n\nthe cement and steel industries (UNIDO, 2010) (IEA, 2008). \n\nAdditionally, and even if the costs for CO2 capture can diverge considerably with the size, type and \n\nlocation of the industrial processes, the costs will be lowest for processes or plants that operate at high \n\nload factors and processes that can use waste heat to supply the energy requirements of CO2 capture \n\nsystems (IPCC, 2005).  \n\n3.3.1 High-purity CO2 Sources \n\nThere are several processes in industry and in fuel production that attain a high purity, high \n\nconcentration CO2 off-gas. These CO2 off-gases can be readily dehydrated, compressed, transported \n\nand stored.  \n\nEven if the CO2 emissions from these activities are relatively modest when compared to the emissions \n\nfrom other activities, these CO2 streams offer significant potential for \u201eearly opportunity? CCS \n\ndemonstration projects since there is no need for the energy-intensive step of CO2 separation which  \n\nprovides lower cost options for CCS. \n\nThese CO2 high purity sources include: \n\n- Natural gas processing;  \n\n- H2 production (including for the production of ammonia and ammonia-based fertilisers); \n\n- Synthetic fuel production (e.g. CtL\n6\n and GtL\n\n7\n); and  \n\n                                                      \n\n6\n CtL (coal-to-liquid) is a synthetic hydrocarbon liquid that is converted form coal. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    27 \n\n \n\n- Several organic chemical production processes (e.g. ethylene oxide production) (UNIDO, \n2010).             \n\nThe streams of waste gas generated within all the above mentioned industrial processes reach \n\nconcentrations of CO2 within 30% to 100% (UNIDO, 2010). \n\nNatural Gas Processing \n\nNatural gas reservoirs, other than natural gas, often contain a mixture of acid gases including H2S and \n\nCO2. H2S needs to be removed to trace levels from natural gas since it is extremely corrosive when \n\nmixed with water and toxic to biological organisms (CCC, 2010). The CO2 content of raw natural gas \n\nlies between 2% and 70% by volume (UNIDO, 2010). The required level of CO2 removal varies \n\ndepending on delivery route and end use (CCC, 2010). In order to comply with pipeline specifications \n\nCO2 has to be removed until its content is reduced to below 2% by volume for transportation, (IPCC, \n\n2005). Characteristic specifications for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and GTL feedstock are less than \n\n0.2% of CO2 content by volume (UNIDO, 2010). The basic natural gas processing (NGP) \n\nconfiguration for removing CO2 from natural gas is termed \u201egas sweetening?. This process results in an \n\noff-gas containing between 96% and 99% of CO2.  \n\nHydrogen Production  \n\nEach year, about 45 to 50 Mt of H2 are produced globally. The bulk of H2 production is based on fossil \n\nfuel feedstocks and around half of the H2 generated is used to produce ammonia (UNIDO, 2010).   \n\nThe methods used for H2 generation from fossil fuel or biomass feedstock include: steam reforming, \n\nauto-thermal reforming (ATR), partial oxidation (POX), and gasification. All these methods are based \n\nin solid fuel gasification or natural gas reforming technologies to produce a syngas. The water-gas \n\nshift reaction process converts the syngas into a mixture of H2 and CO2 in variable quantities. In the \n\ncase of a H2 purified stream production, the CO2 must be removed, whereas for synthetic fuel \n\nproduction, the water-gas shift conversion and gas clean-up steps are controlled to optimise the H2/CO \n\nratio (UNIDO, 2010).  \n\nAmmonia Production \n\nAmmonia is one of the most used inorganic chemicals in the world and almost all nitrogen fertilizers \n\nare derived from ammonia (IFA, 2011). Natural gas is, worldwide, the dominant feedstock for \n\nammonia production although a substantial portion (27%) is coal-based (IFA, 2011). CO2 is routinely \n\ncaptured from ammonia production plants and the CO2 removed is frequently used for the production \n\nof urea and nitro-phosphates within the same integrated plant. In most ammonia plants, CO2 is \n\nseparated from H2 at an early stage generally using solvent absorption (IEA, 2008).  \n\nSynthetic Fuel Production   \n\nGiven the potential to diminish oil dependency, the gasification of carbon-containing feedstocks (coal, \n\nnatural gas and biomass) followed by hydrocarbon synfuel production has been receiving ample \n\nattention for some decades now. A variety of synfuels have been proposed: methanol, DiMethyl Ether \n\n(DME), naphtha/gasoline and diesel. These fuels production processes energy efficiencies range from \n\n40% to 70% and as a consequence, they emit large amounts of CO2 which can be captured and stored \n\n(IEA, 2008). \n\nEthylene Oxide Production  \n\nA key use for ethylene oxide (EO) is as a chemical intemediate in industry (EPA, 2000). EO is \n\nproduced by direct oxidation of etylene over a silver catalyst (UNIDO, 2010).  A side reaction \n\nproduces, amog others, CO2 and water. This CO2 can be partly re-used in the reactor feed, vented or \n\nused in commercial applications (IEA, 2011j).  \n\n                                                                                                                                                                      \n\n7\n GtL (gas-to-liquid) refers to a synthetic diesel fuel which is converted from natural gas. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    28 \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Cement Industry \n\nCement production is an energy and raw material intensive process that emits large quantities of CO2. \n\nThese emissions arise from three separate sources: fuel combustion, limestone calcination in the kiln \n\n(while in the kiln, limestone is broken down into CO2 and lime) and indirectly through electricity use \n\n(Ellerman, et al. 2010) (EPA, 2011).   \n\nSeveral different studies within the IEA, the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) and the European \n\nCement Research Academy (ECRA) have focused on the cement industry emissions reductions \n\npotential (IEA, 2009). According to the IEA, the cement industry is expected to play a key role within \n\nthe CO2 mitigation targets and CCS technologies are viewed as the main solution to achieve deep \n\nemission cuts within this sector (IEA, 2008). \n\nThe cement industry is active in R&amp;D for CO2 capture and post-combustion CO2 capture and oxy-fuel \n\ntechnologies are recognized as possible options for the sector. Nevertheless, before 2020, CCS \n\ntechnologies in the cement industry are not likely to be commercially available since, before then, \n\nfurther research and pilot tests are required to gain practical experience with these technologies (IEA, \n\n2009) (IEA, 2011j).  \n\n3.3.3 Iron and Steel Production  \n\nThe production of iron and steel is also an energy intensive activity that generates substantial process-\n\nrelated CO2 emissions and CCS technologies are considered the main option to achieve deep emission \n\ncuts within the sector (EPA, 2011) (IEA, 2008). \n\nIn the iron and steel making, depending on the production process used, a number of CO2 capture \n\nsystems have the potential to be implemented. However, CCS faces many uncertainties regarding cost, \n\nefficiency and technology choice. Direct CO2 emissions of iron and steel production are very site \n\nspecific and depend on the iron and steel making procedure (IEA, 2011j).    \n\n3.3.4 Refineries \n\nRefineries produce significant amounts of CO2 emissions depending on processed crude, extent of \n\nprocessing, and quality and composition of the product mix. A unique characteristic of the refining \n\nindustry is that it entails multiple CO2 sources and hence different technologies for emissions \n\nmitigation may be required depending on the source. The greatest sources of CO2 emissions stem from \n\nprocess heaters, utilities and FFC, and from H2 manufacture. All three key capture methods, post-\n\ncombustion from diluted flue gas streams, pre-combustion capture from syngases, and oxy-fuel \n\ncombustion for concentrating CO2 in flue gases, could be applicable (IEA, 2011j).  \n\nThe role of CCS in the refining industry is unclear owing to comparably high costs of capture, thigh \n\nrefining margins and multiple different CO2 sources within a refining site (DNV, 2010) \n\n3.3.5 Pulp and Paper Plants  \n\nThe pulp and paper is an increasing global industry that emits considerable amounts of CO2. \n\nApproximately 60% of CO2 emissions in the pulp and paper industry are from biomass fuel \n\ncombustion. Pulp and paper industry off-gases contain 13-14% of CO2 and post-combustion capture of \n\nCO2 from these diluted streams is expensive. Black liquor gasification can be applied for production of \n\nliquid fuels and allow for easier capture of CO2 using pre-combustion technologies. (IEA, 2011j).    \n\n3.4 CO2 Transportation and Storage   \n\nFor CCS technologies to be an effective option for global climate change reduction, and for its high \n\ncosts to be justified, significant quantities of the CO2 captured must be stored for a long period. To \n\nintegrate point source emissions with geological storage solutions, CO2  needs to be transported. In \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    29 \n\n \n\ntheory, CO2 can be transported via pipeline (on-and offshore), by ship or by tank wagons. However, \n\nmost of the CO2 transportation is achieved via pipeline since pipelines are generally the most cost-\n\neffective way to transport large volumes of CO2. Additionally, the technologies involved in pipeline \n\ntransportation are the same as those extensively used for transporting natural gas, oil and several other \n\nfluids worldwide (CCSA, 2011). Therefore, this is a relatively \u201emature? option, and has been in \n\noperation for some decades and comprises most of the existing CO2 transportation infrastructures \n\naround the world. In North America, with an excellent safety track record (IEA, 2008), there is a 5900 \nkm pipeline structure transporting approximately 50Mtpa of CO2 for EOR (GCI, 2011a).  \n\nTransporting CO2 by ship may as well be a competitive choice for transporting large volumes over \n\nlong distances. Supposing port access, shipping may be the only practical option if onshore pipeline \n\nstructures and appropriate storage locations are not available, and for the reason that offshore pipelines \n\nare considerably more expensive.  \n\nAn Integrated CO2 \u201cnetwork\u201d for CCS   \n\nFor CCS to be extensively deployed, a broad transportation infrastructure is necessary, and CO2 \n\npipelines will be required to serve many users. In fact, much of the already existing CO2 pipeline \n\nstructure in the world implements an integrated network\n8\n approach (GCI, 2011a).   \n\nEven if a network approach comprises additional risks, higher initial investment levels, and \n\ninteroperability issues, the economies of scale and other benefits compared to a standalone individual \n\nCCS project can offer economic benefits and are inducing the expansion of proposed CCS projects \n\n(GCI, 2011a). Therefore, and as CCS builds from demonstration to commercialization, CO2 networks \n\nwill require co-ordination on a regional, national and international level to optimise infrastructure \n\ndevelopment and to reduce costs. \n\nCO2 Storage   \n\nThe different types of geological storage presently under consideration within the Global CCS \n\nInstitute are summarily described in Table 3-5.

By the end of last year, 234 active or planned CCS projects \n\nwere identified across a range of technologies, project types and sectors. Seventy-seven of these 234 \n\nprojects are large-scale integrated projects (LSIP) (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nThe asset lifecycle model represents the various stages in the development of a project (Table 3-6).  \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    31 \n\n \n\nTable 3-6 \u2013 Asset lifecycle model (GCI, 2011a) \n\n Final \n\nInvestment \n\nDecision \n\n \n\n Planning  Active \n\nProject \n\nphase \n\nIdentify Evaluate  Define Execute  Operate \n\nDeveloper\u2019s \n\ngoals \n\nEstablish \n\npreliminary \n\nscope and \n\nbusiness \n\nstrategy \n\nEstablish \n\ndevelopment \n\noptions and \n\nexecution \n\nstrategy \n\nFinalise \n\nscope and \n\nexecution \n\nplan \n\nDetailed \n\ndesign and \n\nconstruction \n\nOperate \n\nmaintain \n\nand \n\nimprove \n\ncosts \n\n Select \n\nconcept \n\n  Start-\n\nup \n\n \n\n \n\nOf the 77 LSIP, 8 are operating projects and 4 projects are in the execution stage of the asset lifecycle. \n\nThe remaining 65 LSIP are in different phases of development planning (phases of the asset lifecycle \n\npreceding the final investment decision) (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nAll 8 operating LSIP and the 4 in execution are associated with the oil and gas sector: they either \n\ncapture CO2 via natural gas processing or they inject CO2 for EOR (Table 3-7). \n\nTable 3-7 \u2013 Active CCS LSIP (GCI, 2011a).   \n\n Name Location Capture Storage \n\nOperation \n\nstage \n\nSleipner CO2 Injection Norway Gas processing Deep saline formation \n\nSn\u00f8hvit CO2 Injection Norway Gas processing Deep saline formation \n\nIn Salah CO2 Injection Northhern Africa Gas processing Deep saline formation \n\nWeyburn-Midale CO2 \n\nMonitoring and Storage \n\nProject \n\nCanada/United States Pre-combustion \n\n(synfuels) \n\nEOR with MMV \n\nRangely Weber Sand \n\nUnit CO2 Injection \n\nProject \n\nUnited States Gas processing EOR with MMV \n\nSalt Creek Enhanced \n\nOil Recovery \n\nUnited States Gas processing EOR \n\nEnid Fertiliser United States Pre-combustion \n\n(fertiliser) \n\nEOR \n\nSharon Ridge EOR United States Gas processing EOR \n\nExecution \n\nstage \n\nSouthern Company \n\nIGCC Project \n\nUnited States Pre-combustion (power) EOR \n\nOccidental Gas \n\nProcessig Plant \n\nUnited States Gas processing EOR \n\nEnhance Energy EOR \n\nProject \n\nCanada Pre-combustion \n\n(fertiliser and oil \n\nrefining) \n\nEOR \n\nGorgon Carbon Dioxide \n\nInjection Project \n\nAustralia Gas processing Deep saline formation \n\n \n\nWithin the power generation sector there are 42 LSIP in development planning. Most of those are \n\nplanned for coal-fired applications and are in different stages of development planning. An important \n\nexception is the Southern Company IGCC Project, which is in the Execute phase (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nAmong the LSIP there are 2 iron and steel projects, 1 cement project and 1 pulp and paper project \n\n(GCI, 2011a).   \n\nMost LSIP are found in developed countries, such as in the United States, Europe, Canada and \n\nAustralia, with a few in emerging markets such as China. Driven by a variety of incentives being \n\noffered by the government as well as the extensive practice of EOR, the United States has the largest \n\namount of newly identified LSIP and dominates project activity. The biggest sum of cancellations and \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    32 \n\n \n\ndelays of LSIP has occurred in Europe. Still, Europe has also had the highest amount of projects \n\nmoving forward in the asset lifecycle. With six and five LSIP, the United Kingdom and the \n\nNetherlands present the largest number of projects in the Europe. Even though public funding (from \n\nthe European Union and some National Governments) is supporting activity, weak economic \n\nconditions and difficulties surrounding use of onshore storage sites have increased uncertainty in \n\ninvestment decision making in Europe (GCI, 2011a).   \n\nFigure 3-1 presents all active and planned projects by industry sector and by asset lifecycle stage. \n\n \nFigure 3-1 - All active and planned projects by industry sector and by asset lifecycle stage (GCI, \n\n2011a).   \n\nThe power industry, which has been, up till now, the foremost beneficiary of government \n\narrangements in support of large-scale demonstration of CCS, accounted for almost half of all active \n\nand planned project activity in 2010 (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nPre-combustion and post-combustion capture technologies dominate the LSIP, with 33 projects (43%) \n\nand 21 projects (27%) correspondingly (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nThe flexibility of the pre-combustion capture technology is shown through the spread of projects \n\nacross power generation (19), synthetic natural gas (5), coal-to-liquids (3), fertiliser production (3), oil \n\nrefining (2) and H2 production (1). The bulk of pre-combustion capture within LSIP is being \n\ndeveloped for new build facilities. In contrast, around 60% of the post-combustion capture projects \n\ninvolve retrofitting existing facilities (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nOxy-fuel combustion is being planned or considered within 4 projects, all in the power generation \n\nindustry, including the recently restructured FutureGen 2.0 project in the United States (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nIn order to compare the status of technologies being considered for CCS implementation there are 4 \n\ncategories to designate the level of technology maturity in use: commercial, demonstration, pilot and \n\nbench. These are primarily defined by the scale of the activity in a particular industry. For instance a \n\ncommercial process is presented for sale by one or more trustworthy vendors with standard \n\ncommercial assurances; a large-scale demonstration process entails the integration of technologies into \n\na full-size structure to demonstrate viability and commercial readiness in a specific application. When \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    33 \n\n \n\nin a pilot stage, a process or technology is being tested in a realistic environment, typically at one to \n\ntwo orders of magnitude minor than a full-scale demonstration, once it has been created in a controlled \n\nenvironment in a bench or laboratory scale successfully (GCI, 2011a).     \n\nAll active and planned projects by industry sector and by technology maturity are presented in Figure \n\n3-2.  \n\n \nFigure 3-2 - All active and planned projects by industry sector and by technology maturity (GCI, \n\n2011a).    \n\nPipelines are the most common means for CO2 transport within LSIPs and almost 90% of LSIPs \n\ninvolve transporting CO2 or are planning to transport CO2 via pipelines (GCI, 2011a).   \n\nPotential storage of CO2 is evenly split between EOR and deep saline formations options (GCI, \n\n2011a).  Table 3-8 presents the CO2 storage current large-scale projects but does not include those \n\nprojects where the exact storage type has not been specified. \n\nTable 3-8 \u2013 CO2 storage large-scale projects (GCI, 2011a)   \n\nStorage type Current large-scale projects \n\nDepleted oil and gas reservoirs 8 in the planning stages \n\nEnhanced oil or gas recovery with CO2 \n\n \n\n32, most are in North America (5 operational; 24 \n\nplanned; 3 in construction) \n\nDeep saline formations 26 (3 operational; 22 planned; 1 in construction) \n\nUnmineable coal seams None (TBC) \n\nBasalt formations 1 (planned) \n\n \n\nIn the near to medium term EOR will probably continue to be a common form of potential storage. \n\nDespite the fact that this route can act as an \u201eenabler? for a less costly and faster mechanism for the \n\ndemonstration of capture technologies, additional improvements in the monitoring and verification of \n\ninjected CO2 to demonstrate permanent storage is considered crucial. Deep saline formations offer \n\nmuch greater storage potential in the longer term but, the time and expense of proving up this storage \n\noption, particularly in offshore applications, should not be undervalued (GCI, 2011a).   \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    34 \n\n \n\nSeveral LSIPs in the Define phase have satisfactory funding to complete their current asset lifecycle \n\nstage of development; however, a large number of projects in the Identify and Evaluate stages may not \n\nadvance except if additional funding is forthcoming (GCI, 2011a).    \n\n3.5.2 Costs  \n\nDeveloping and deploying CCS LSIP is challenging and one of the main obstacles is the relatively \n\nhigh cost of the technologies to capture the CO2, transport it and safely store it compared to the same \n\nfacilities without CCS. \n\nProject costs can fluctuate significantly and published estimates show an extensive range of costs for \n\nCCS owing to the diversity of project-specific factors. These factors, among others, include: the scale \n\nof the facility, its expected life-time, load factor and labour rates; the type and costs of fuel consumed; \n\nthe selection of CCS technology and design; the CO2 capture targets; the distances, terrains and the \n\nCO2 quantities involved to transport and storage (IPCC, 2005).  \n\nInvestment decisions on CCS projects depend on several case-specific boundary circumstances such \n\nas, among others: the emission market; the national or regional policy and regulatory frameworks; the \n\navailability of incentive and financing structures; they also depend on the experience and risk profile \n\nof the investor (IEA, 2011b). \n\nEach part of the CCS value chain includes multiple variants and publicly available CCS technologies \n\ncost data are scarce; therefore, without access to detailed project specific information, project based \n\ncosts provide limited guidance on underlying technology costs. \n\nHowever, one thing is certain: within the whole CCS process chain the CO2 capture technologies are \n\ngenerally expected to entail, by far, the largest absolute cost.   \n\nIn the power sector, and as previously stated, CO2 capture is still an emerging technology that has not \n\nbeen demonstrated on a commercial scale and related cost information is still uncertain and is based \n\non feasibility studies and pilot projects. The accuracy of techno-economic data for CCS is expected to \n\nimprove when supplementary information from the first commercial scale demonstration plants are \n\navailable (IEA, 2011b). \n\nTable 3-9 presents economic data for CO2 capture within power generation, including CO2 \n\nconditioning and compression. It presents average OECD results, since available data for CO2 capture \n\nfrom power generation in non-OECD countries is very limited. This data from the working paper \n\n\u201cCost and Performance of Carbon Dioxide Capture from Power Generation\u201d from the IEA is based on \n\nestimates published over 5 years in major engineering studies from about 50 CO2 capture installations \n\nat power plants. Capital costs and levelised cost of electricity (LCOE\n9\n) are re-evaluated and updated to \n\n2010 cost levels to allow for a consistent comparison.   \n\n \n\nTable 3-9 \u2013 Economic data for CO2 capture (including conditioning and compression) in \npower plants (2010 USD) (IEA, 2011b). \n\n Post-combustion \n\ncapture from coal-fired \n\npower generation by \n\namines \n\nPost-combustion \n\ncapture from \n\nnatural gas-fired \n\ngeneration \n\nOxy-combustion \n\nfrom coal-fired \n\npower generation \n\nPre-combustion \n\ncapture from \n\nIGCC \n\nCapital cost without \n\ncapture (USD/KW) \n\n1899 925 1931 2356 \n\nCapital cost with \n\ncapture (USD/KW) \n\n3135 1541 3153 3166 \n\n                                                      \n\n9\n LCOE is commonly used as a measure of comparing generating costs of different power generation and \n\ncapture technologies over a plant?s economic life.

WorleyParsons estimated costs of CCS applications \n\nto existing industrial systems for: blast furnace production of steel; cement kiln/furnaces; natural gas \n\nprocessing; and fertiliser production (ammonia). As formerly discussed the latter two processes attain \n\na high purity, high concentration CO2 off-gas and therefore do not require the energy-intensive step of \n\nCO2 separation which results on lower cost routes for CCS technologies deployment.  \n\nTable 3-10 \u2013 CCS costs in industrial processes (GCI, 2011a).    \n\n Blast furnace \n\nsteel production \n\nCement Natural gas \n\nprocessing \n\nFertiliser \n\nproduction \n\nAvoided CO2 cost (US$/tonne CO2) 54 54 19 20 \n\n \n\nCompared to CO2 capture processes data, transportation and storage associated data are even more \n\ndifficult to generalise, since that they are extremely site-specific or even unique for every project \n\n(IEA, 2011b). \n\nCosts for CO2 transportation depend on distance and quantities involved and on local geographical \n\nconditions. Still, the transport costs are generally considered low when compared to the CO2 capture \n\ncosts. As stated before, the transportation of CO2 by pipeline offers potential cost savings through \n\ncombining the flow of CO2 from multiple sources into a single pipeline to a common storage site \n\n(GCI, 2011b). \n\nA balanced decision on transport modes and a rigorous matching of CO2 sources and sinks over time \n\nare evident opportunities to reduce costs.  \n\nThe costs of CO2 storage are site specific, driven by the geology of the storage formation (GCI, \n\n2011b). Recently released economic studies suggest that storage costs contribute to less than 5% under \n\nideal conditions, rising to about 10% for storage sites with \u201epoorer? geologic properties. In some cases, \n\nwithout a suitable storage site that is reachable by effective transport units, CCS may not be an option  \n\n                                                      \n\n10\n Overnight costs include, according to OECD terminology: pre-construction or owner?s costs, engineering and \n\nconstruction costs and contingency costs. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    36 \n\n \n\n3.5.3 Legal and Regulatory Framework \n\nIn order to boost CCS deployment, important progress is being made in the development of CCS legal \n\nand regulatory frameworks worldwide (IEA, 2011c). In fact, in recent years the international \n\ncommunity has amended several international legal instruments, including international marine \n\nlegislation and climate change frameworks. However, a number of important issues remain unresolved \n\nand legal and regulatory progress has been largely circumscribed to OECD countries and regions with \n\nless progress realized in non-OECD regions (GCI, 2011a). In the latter countries, CCS regulatory \n\ndevelopment will be of particular importance, especially in the largest emitting countries such as \n\nChina.  \n\nTo allow for offshore CO2 storage, the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine \n\nPollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Protocol) was amended, in November \n\n2006. This amendment came into force without having to be ratified by contracting parties since the \n\namendment was made to the Annex of the Protocol (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nIn October 2009 the London Protocol was once again amended to allow cross-border transportation of \n\nCO2 intended for storage, however, this amendment modifies the body of the protocol and therefore it \n\nwill only enter into force once two-thirds of all contracting parties to the London Protocol have \n\naccepted the amendment. Thus, under the London Protocol, CO2 cross-border transportation is still \n\nprohibited (GCI, 2011a).     \n\nIn 2007, to embrace analogous alterations, the Convention for the Protection of the Marine \n\nEnvironment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention) was amended as well. Yet again, the \n\namendments are not in force and necessitate ratification by seven contracting parties under the OSPAR \n\nConvention?s ratification provisions to enter into effect. So far, six contracting parties to the OSPAR \n\nConvention have ratified the amendment, which means that the amendment may enter into force \n\nimminently, with only another party required to ratify the modifications (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nAdditionally, important advancement has been accomplished in addressing some of the most \n\nchallenging CCS legal and regulatory issues such as long-term liability, with several countries and \n\nregions having launched regulatory approaches to address this subject (GCI, 2011a).    \n\nAt the COP16 Climate Change negotiations in Cancun, in November and December 2010, within the \n\ninternational frameworks for climate change, it has been established that CCS ought to be entitled as a \n\nCDM\n11\n\n project activity, once different specific issues are addressed and resolved in an appropriate \n\nway. This mechanism embodies the most significant step towards an international encouragement for \n\nregulating and supporting CCS projects in developing countries within the past five years (GCI, \n\n2011a).    \n\nIn Europe the development of CCS legal and regulatory frameworks is founded around the European \n\nUnion CCS Directive (Directive 2009/31/EC). This Directive establishes a framework for regulating \n\nCO2 storage, including requirements on permitting, composition of the CO2 stream, monitoring, \n\nreporting, inspections, corrective measures, closure and post-closure obligations, transfer of \n\nresponsibility to the state, and financial security. This Directive also amends several other European \n\nUnion laws to establish requirements on capture and transport operations and diminish existing legal \n\nobstacles to the CO2 geological storage (GCI, 2011a).    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                      \n\n11\n The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol allows projects in developing countries to \n\ngenerate emission credits if they result in emission levels lower than would otherwise be the case; these credits \n\ncan be marketed and eventually counted against a developed country's emission obligation. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    37 \n\n \n\n4 COMET Project  \n\nThe COMET (Integrated infrastructure for CO2 transport and storage in the west MEdiTerranean) \n\nproject, funded under 7th FWP (Seventh Framework Programme\n12\n\n), aims to study the techno-\n\neconomic feasibility of integrating CO2 transport and storage infrastructures in the West \n\nMediterranean region, within Portugal, Spain and Morocco. \n\nThe project feasibility study will take into account several scenarios of energy system development for \n\nthe time period 2010-2050, the location and development of the major CO2 point sources and the \n\navailable potential for geological storage in each of those countries. The long-term development of the \n\nPortuguese, Spanish and Moroccan energy systems is modeled and evaluated via the technical \n\neconomic models MARKAL/TIMES. MARKAL is the acronym for MARket Allocation and TIMES \u2013 \n\nwhich is the next generation version of MARKAL \u2013 stands for the Integrated MARKAL-EFOM \n\nSystem. TIMES is an economic model generator for local, national or multi-regional energy systems, \n\nwhich provides a technology-rich basis for estimating energy dynamics over a long-term, multi-period \n\ntime horizon. It is usually applied to the analysis of the entire energy sector, but it may also be applied \n\nto study in detail single sectors such as, for example, the electricity and district heat sector. \n\nThe need for a joint CCS infrastructure in the West Mediterranean is related to the geographical \n\nproximity, to the increasing connections between the energy and industrial sectors in the area, to the \n\ncontinuity of sedimentary basins that can act as possible storage reservoirs and to the existing \n\nexperience in managing a large gas transport infrastructure, such as the natural gas pipeline coming \n\nthrough Morocco, to Spain and Portugal. The consortium is coordinated by INETI (Portugal), and \n\ncomprises 7 research institutions, 4 Universities, 1 SME and 5 energy companies from 6 European \n\ncountries and Morocco.  \n\nIt is expected that the project results will generate insights that can contribute considerably to the \n\ndeployment of CCS in the area. \n\nThe COMET project is divided within the following 7 Work Packages (WP): \n\nWP1: Project management and coordination \n\nWP2: Identification of the location and the amounts of CO2 emissions from the sources (Portugal, \n\nSpain and Morocco).  \n\nWP3: Identification of the locations and the storage capacity of potential sinks in the region (Portugal,  \n\nWP4: GIS\n13\n\n integration of all the information and elements of a CO2 transmission network \n\nWP5: Analysis of the Moroccan, Portuguese and Spanish energy systems and its modelling via \n\nMARKAL/TIMES.  \n\nWP6: In depth assessment of the most promising infrastructure options (scenario building, transport \n\ncosts, technical-economic evaluation of different options).  \n\nWP7: Promotion, Dissemination and International collaboration. \n\n  \n\n                                                      \n\n12\n FP7 is the short name for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. \n\nThis is the EU's main instrument for funding research in Europe and it will run from 2007-2013.

The \n\ncountry shares borders with Algeria in the east and with Mauritania in the south. This Maghreb \n\ncountry is separated from Europe by the Strait of Gibraltar and is sited at approximately 14 km from \n\nSpain at the nearest point. Rabat is the capital city. \n\n \nFigure 5-1 - Moroccan territory (GPM, 2011) \n\nWith an area of 710850 km\n2\n and a large extension in latitude, from 21\u00b0 to 36\u00b0 north, this country \n\ncomprises four topographical zones: the Atlas and Rif mountain ranges to the north reaching altitudes \n\nof 4165 m; the Sahara desert to the south; the fertile coastal plains to the west and the drier Anti-Atlas \n\nregion in the centre.  \n\nThe country coast extends over 3500 km a fact that has an important effect on the climate, commercial \n\nrelations, tourism, fishing activities, and in coastline urbanization. The dominating weather in \n\nMorocco is Mediterranean, temperated in the west and in the north by the North Atlantic Ocean. Inside \n\nthe country, the weather is more continental with major differences of temperature. Rain fall is \n\nconcentrated in the winter months in line with northern hemisphere weather patterns. The hot and dry \n\nsummer months have temperatures as high as 40\u00b0C throughout the country and even superior in some \n\nremote inland regions. The Atlas area is very humid, and snowfalls are frequent during the winter \n\nmonths. The south has desert weather. Morocco is part of the subtropical zone and it is exposed in the \n\nsummer to the conditions of the warm dry zone and to the fresh, wet and moderate conditions in the \n\nwinter. There are numerous rivers in the country. The main ones are the Moulouya River, which drains \n\ninto the Mediterranean Sea, and the Sebou and Oum Rbi\u00e2 Rivers, which flow into the Atlantic Ocean.  \n\nReady to be approved by the parliament is the division of the country within the following 12 regions: \n\nEastern region and Rif, Tanger-T\u00e9touan, F\u00e8s-Mekn\u00e8s, Rabat-Sal\u00e9-K\u00e9nitra, Beni Mellal-Kh\u00e9nifra, \n\nCasablanca-Settat, Marrakech-Safi, Dr\u00e2a-Tafilalet, Souss-Massa, Guelmim-Oued noun, La\u00e2youne-\n\nSaquia al hamara, Ed dakhla and Oued eddahab.   \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    40 \n\n \n\n5.2 Macro and Socio-Economic Drivers  \n\n5.2.1 Population \n\nIn 2004 the Moroccan population reached 29891708 inhabitants and according to the General Census \n\ncarried out that year by the High Planning Commission, the urban population amounted to 16463634 \n\nwhile the rural population amounted to 13428074 (PNM, 2006). In 2004 the urbanization level \n\nreached 55.1% increasing from 51.4% in 1994. In 1994 the average number of people per household \n\nwas 5.9 (6.6 in rural areas and 5.2 in urban areas) and in 2009 the average number of people decreased \n\nto 4.9 per household (5.8 in rural areas and 4.5 in urban areas) (HCP, 2009).  \n\nIn 2010 the population reached 31.851 million and there were 40 inhabitants per km\n2\n.

Therefore, and with an \n\nincreasing population, in order to sustain this development, the primary energy consumption has risen. \n\nDuring the last decade (2000-2010), the energy consumption has increased by 5% per year on average \n\nmainly stimulated, during the last five years, by a higher electricity consumption which has increased \n\nby 7.5% per year on average (UNCCC, 2010). This power consumption upsurge is attributable to both \n\nthe expansion of the rural electrification as part of the Global Rural Electrification Program (PERG), a \n\nproject launched by the Moroccan authorities and the ONE (National Office of Electricity) in 1996, \n\nand to the country?s economic progress. According to the Minister of Energy, Mines, Water and \n\nEnvironment in 2020, primary energy and electricity consumption will double, compared to their level \n\nin 2008, and by 2030 these consumptions will be three and four times greater, respectively (UNCCC, \n\n2010).  \n\nIn 1995 the energy use was of 8592 ktoe whereas by 2008 it reached 14977 ktoe (Figure 5-3). Energy \n\nuse (kt of oil equivalent) refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels, \n\nwhich is equal to indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels \n\nsupplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport (World Bank, 2011). \n\n8\n5\n\n9\n2\n\n9\n0\n\n7\n5\n\n9\n3\n\n6\n4\n\n9\n5\n\n5\n5\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n4\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n3\n\n8\n\n1\n0\n\n9\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n0\n7\n\n3\n\n1\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n6\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n3\n\n0\n7\n\n3\n\n1\n3\n\n3\n1\n\n7\n\n1\n4\n3\n5\n4\n\n1\n4\n9\n\n7\n7\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n5\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n6\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n7\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n8\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n9\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n4\n\n2\n0\n0\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\nYear\n\nEnergy use (ktoe)\n\n \nFigure 5-3 \u2013 Energy use evolution between 1995 and 2008 (kt of oil equivalent) (World Bank, 2011) \n\nThe variation of energy use per capita (kg of oil equivalent) within 1995 and 2008 is illustrated in \n\nFigure 5-4.  \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    43 \n\n \n\n3\n1\n9\n\n3\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n3\n8\n\n3\n4\n0\n\n3\n5\n8\n\n3\n5\n5\n\n3\n7\n\n4\n\n3\n7\n5\n\n3\n6\n9\n\n4\n0\n\n3\n\n4\n2\n9\n\n4\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n6\n\n0\n\n4\n7\n\n4\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n5\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n6\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n7\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n8\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n9\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n3\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n4\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n8\n\nYear\n\nEnergy use per capita (kg of oil equivalent per capita)\n\n \nFigure 5-4 - Energy use per capita (kg of oil equivalent per capita) (World Bank, 2011) \n\nFigure 5-5 presents the rising of the TPES by type of fuel within 1972 and 2008 (it excludes electricity \n\ntrades).  \n\n \n Figure 5-5 - Total primary energy supply excluding electricity trade (IEA, 2011i) \n\nAs illustrated in Fig 5-5 the Moroccan energy supply is heavily based on fossil fuels, mainly on oil \n\nand on a smaller scale, on coal/peat products.

In 2007, this power plant provided about 50% of the \n\nnational electricity production.  In 2008 the power plant production was 10022.8 GWh representing a \n\n0.1% evolution relatively to 2007. An extension of the Jorf Lasfar power plant is expected to be \n\ncommissioned between 2012 and 2013 (units 5-6, 700 MW). It will provide the much needed base \n\nload capacity to the country (ONE, 2009). The Mohammedia power plant was built in the early 1980s. \n\nIn 2008 this power plant has produced 823.9 GWh. In that same year the Jerada power plant produced \n\n815.1 GWh (COMET, 2011).  \n\nThe ONE is planning to build a coal fired power plant with two new units (2 x 660 MW) in the Safi \n\nregion. This project is conditioned by the construction of a port infrastructure, near the power plant, \n\ncapable of receiving the fuel. This power plant inauguration is expected by the end of 2012 with a \n\nproduction of about 10 billion KWh per year, representing about 27% of the country?s total demand \n\nby 2015. This coal fired power plant will use \u201cClean Coal\u201d technologies to enhance EE and reduce the \n\nenvironmental impacts (ONE, 2009).    \n\nCombined Cycle Power Plants  \n\nThe Tahaddart power station (385 MW) is the first combined cycle power plant built in the country. It \n\nopened on 20 January 2005. This installation consumes natural gas from the Maghreb Europe pipeline \n\n(MEMEE, 2008). It has a Siemens-manufactured steam turbine and gas turbine (nominal capacity of \n\n400 MW). During 2009, this power plant supplied 2842550 MWh. It operated over 8440 hours at \n\n95.4% capacity, and at an average operating capacity of 336.8 MW. This facility is the first power \n\nplant in the country to have its Environmental Management System certified by an internationally \n\nrecognized body. The UNE-EN ISO 14001 Standard certifies that this power station operates in a way \n\nthat protects the environment (PRP, 2011).  \n\nPlanned to be completed by 2012 an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle power plant (ISCC), will have \n\na 472 MW capacity. Solar energy is to provide 20 MW of these 472 MW. In 2009 this utility, partly \n\noperative, produced 210 GWh (ONE, 2009). This plant is located in Ain B\u00e9ni Mathar (eastern \n\nMorocco) and is to be co-financed by ONE, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the AfDB \n\n(ONE, 2009).   \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    53 \n\n \n\nOil Fired Power Plants \n\nThere are several oil fired power plants in the country: the Mohammedia gas turbine (300 MW, 3 units \n\nx 100 MW), uses fuel oil number 2 as base fuel and produced 1684.8 GWh in 2008; the Kenitra power \n\nplant (300 MW, 4 units x 75 MW) which produced 1637.9 GWh in 2008 representing an evolution of \n\n88.5% relatively to 2007; the Tan Tan power plant (116.5 MW, 7 diesel units) which had a net \n\nproduction of 17.8 GWh in 2007; the Agadir power plant (72 MW, 4 diesel units x 18 MW) which had \n\na net production in 2007 of 6.4 GWh; the Daklha power plant (21 MW, 3 Units) which has entered in \n\nservice in May 2002 and consumes diesel. This facility net production in 2007 was of 42.9 GWh; the \n\nLaayoune power plant, in the Moroccan Sahara, which had a net production of 97.2 GWh in 2007; the \n\nTit Mellil power plant net production in 2007 was 150 GWh; the Tetouan 33 power plant (47.7 GWh \n\nnet production in 2007); the Tetouan 20 power plant (produced 0.6 GWh in 2007); and the Tanger oil \n\npower plant (3.2 GWh net production in 2007) (COMET, 2011) \n\n \n\nRenewable Energy Plants \n\nWind \n\nIn 2010 the wind-power capacity was 280 MW and consisted on the wind farms of Abdelkhalek \n\nTorres (50 MW) and Lafarge (30 MW) in Tetouan, on the Amogdoul (60 MW) in Essaouira and on \n\nthe Tangier1 (140MW) (UNCCC, 2010). \n\nMorocco has started a vast wind energy program, to support the advance of renewable energy and \n\nenergy efficiency in the country. The Moroccan Integrated Wind Energy Project will allow the country \n\nto increase the wind power installed capacity, from 280 MW to 2000 MW in 2020 (AMDI, 2011).  \n\nThe new wind energy farms (1720 MW) are planned as follow:  \n\n- 720 MW under development in Tarfaya (300 MW), Akhfenir (200 MW), Bab El Oued-\nLaayoune (50 MW), Haouma (50 MW) and Jbel Khalladi (120 MW) (AMDI, 2011).   \n\n- 1000 MW planned in 5 new sites chosen for their abundant potential: Tanger 2 (150 MW), El \nBaidaKoudia in Tetouan (300 MW), Taza (150 MW), Tiskrad Laayoune (300 MW) and \n\nBoujdour (100 MW) (AMDI, 2011) (UNCCC, 2010).   \n\nThe main goals of the wind energy program are: raise the share of wind power in the country energy \n\nbalance to 14% by 2020; reach a production capacity from wind power of 2 GW and a yearly \n\nproduction capacity of 6600 GWh; spare 1.5 million ton of fuel per annum, matching the sum of 750 \n\nmillion U.S. dollars, and avoid of 5.6 million ton of CO2 emissions per year (AMDI, 2011).   \n\nSolar  \n\nAt this time, solar energy in Morocco is mostly used in rural and off-grid areas but the country \n\npresents an extensive variety of investment opportunities in the sector of thermal and photovoltaic \n\nsolar energy, including the launch of the succeeding structuring programs: \n\n- The Moroccan Project of Solar Energy that aims to reach 2000 MW of solar power capacity \nby 2020, over 10000 ha, within five locations (Table 5-9) (AMDI, 2011).   \n\nTable 5-9- Capacity and projected annual power generation of the 5 plants (AMDI, 2011) \n(ONE, 2009b) \n\nSite Capacity (MW) Generation (GWh/yr) \n\nOuarzazate 500 1150 \n\nAin Beni Mathar 400 835 \n\nFoum Al Oued 500 1150 \n\nBoujdour 100 230 \n\nSebkhat Tah 500 1040 \n\n \n\nThese facilities will use CSP and PV technologies. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    54 \n\n \n\nThis program will increase by 14% the share of solar energy in total electricity capacity by 2020 and \n\nprevent the emission of 3.7 million tons of CO2 per year. Additionally, this project will avoid 1 million \n\ntoe per year, corresponding to a 500 million dollars saving (ONE, 2009b).  \n\n- The Development Program of the Moroccan market for solar water heaters (PROMASOL) \n(AMDI, 2011).   \n\nThis project includes the installation of 440000 m\n2\n and 1.7 million m\n\n2\n of thermal solar sensors in 2012 \n\nand in 2020 respectively. By 2020, the thermal energy is projected to reach 1190 GWh/yr. This \n\nprogram will prevent the emission of 920000 tons of CO2 annually and generate 920 permanent jobs \n\n(AMDI, 2011).   \n\nThese two solar projects were planned to fall under the criteria of Clean Development Mechanism \n\n(CDM) (AMDI, 2011).   \n\nHydro \n\nAt the end of 2009 the hydro-power installed capacity reached 1748 MW and consisted on hydro-\n\nturbines (1284 MW) and on hydro-pumping (464 MW) (ONE, 2009). \n\nThe country is focused on the development decentralized small hydropower projects for remote areas. \n\nHydroelectric power does not automatically involve a large dam and some power plants use a small \n\ncanal to channel river water through a turbine and several of these projects are now under progress by \n\nADEREE.  \n\nChanges in precipitation and surface runoff intensely affect the extent of hydroelectric power \n\ngenerated. The rainfalls can vary considerably from one year to another.

The Green Morocco strategy to boost agricultural \nproduction and new regulations for waste management stands for an additional 400 MW capacity by \n\n2030. In 2002 an U.S. consortium (GESI-Edgeboro-SADAT) won a government tender for the \n\nmanagement of the first controlled landfill in Fes (MLRH, 2011). The 10 year contract of construction \n\nand operation of this landfill has been extended in 2007 for another 20 years to recover and reuse the \n\nbiogas from the landfill allowing an estimated 3 MW generation that could be used for public lighting \n\n(ECOMED, 2011). \n\n \n\nNuclear Power Plants \n\nThe ONE ponders the nuclear power option as one of the feasible solutions to meet the future power \n\ndemand of Morocco. In the beginning of the 1980s, the ONE commenced site and technical-economic \n\nviability assessments for the first nuclear power plant in the country in the framework of a settlement \n\nsigned with SOFRATOME (French company), with the technical support of the International Atomic \n\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) (IAEA, 2010). \n\nThe site of Sidi Boulbra, located on the Moroccan Atlantic coast between the cities of Safi and \n\nEssaouira, was elected and qualified as a capable site to have a nuclear power plant under the \n\nnecessary nuclear safety conditions. Sidi Boulbra site might take up to 4 units of 1000 MW each \n\n(IAEA, 2010). \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    56 \n\n \n\nThe Moroccan governmental strategy has intentions to introduce nuclear power by 2020-2025 (IAEA, \n\n2010).  \n\nThe national strategy concerning fuel exploration and radioactive waste management has not been \n\ndecided so far as it depends on other several aspects, such as the reactor type and the viability of \n\nuranium extraction (IAEA, 2010). \n\n \n\nCombined Heat Power Plants \n\nPresently, there are no CHP plants in the country. \n\nTotal Installed Capacity \n\nIn 2005 the installed capacity totaled 5252 MW (Table 5-12).

This \n\nproduction satisfied about 84% of the electricity demand in that year. \n\n5.3.1.4 Electricity Transmission \n\nWith a grid consisting of HV/VHV lines (60, 150, 225 and 400 kV) ONE is responsible for the power \n\ntransmission (ONE, 2009). \n\nIn order to sustain the rising power demand, the investments within the power sector from 1999 to \n\n2008, reached 53 billion DH, and have covered the PERG, the reinforcement of the production base, \n\nthe development of the transportation network and the improvement of the distribution infrastructure \n\n(MEMEE, 2008). \n\nBetween 1999 and 2008, the ONE continued its program for the reinforcement of the national \n\ntransmission network which includes the interconnections with neighbour countries. These works aim \n\nto reinforce the reliability and the security of the transport network and the increase of trade with \n\nneighbour countries, with a view to the opening of the national electricity market to the competition \n\nand its integration in the Euro-Maghreb market. As a result, in this period, the works in the very high \n\nand high voltage transmission lines exceeded 4500 Km (MEMEE, 2008).  \n\nMorocco has electrical interconnections with Spain and Algeria. The submarine electrical cable \n\nconnection with Spain was established in 1997 and provides an exchange of 1400 MW. Morocco?s \n\nelectricity network is connected with the networks of Algeria and Tunisia; these three countries \n\nformed the COMELEC (Comit\u00e9 Maghr\u00e9bin de l\u2019Electricit\u00e9) in 1975 to promote electricity exchanges \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    58 \n\n \n\nand they were later joined by Libya and Mauritania. The electrical grid interconnection with Algeria \n\nwas established in 1992 and ensures 1200 MW (MEMME, 2008b). \n\nThe reinforcement of the Morocco-Spain interconnection became necessary in order to allow an \n\nincrease in the import capacity. The start of the operation of the 2nd interconnection between Morocco \n\nand Spain occurred in June 2006, allowing an increase in the import capacity to 700 MW. Morocco, \n\nowing to its special geographical position at the heart of an international energy crossroads is set to \n\nbecome a key hub of the increasing power exchange between the countries around the Mediterranean, \n\nthanks to the reinforcement of the interconnections it has established with Spain and Algeria. \n\nIn 2009 the transmission network total length has reached 20350 km.

The retail prices however are still relatively high by regional standards. The \n\nrates are set by ministerial decree. Table 5-17 presents the residential electricity prices. \n\nTable 5-17 - Residential electricity prices (RECREEE, 2010) \n\nConsumption per month Price Dh/kWh \n\n0 - 100 kWh 0.9010 \n\n101 - 200 kWh 0.9689 \n\n201 - 500 kWh 1.0541 \n\n> 500 kWh 1.4407 \n\n \n\nRural consumers are charged through a pre-paid meter system.

A study carried out in 1999 indicated that the offshore basin nearby Tarfaya (near Morocco?s \n\nsouthern Saharan provinces) would be the most suitable area for oil reserves (RECREEE, 2010). The \n\nGharb and the Essaouira basin as well as near the Rif, a mountainous region in the north of Morocco, \n\nare thought to be the most promising onshore regions. The Ireland?s oil company Circle Oil reported a \n\nsuccessful drilling and testing of a gas well in the Gharb region northeast of Rabat.  \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    60 \n\n \n\nRegarding oil shale, Morocco has the sixth largest proven reserves in the world. Morocco?s total in \n\nplace oil shale reserves are estimated at around 50 billion barrels (as of 2006) (RECREEE, 2010). The \n\nmajor deposits, located near Tarfaya and Timahdit, are well explored and are the most probable to \n\ninitiate commercial production in the near future. The Timahdit deposit, sited about 250 km southeast \n\nof Rabat zone, has an estimated 16.1 billion barrels of oil in place. Tarfaya contains about 22.7 billion \n\nbarrels of oil.  \n\nTo become less dependent on energy imports and in order to diversify its primary energy sources \n\nMorocco has taken the first step headed for commercially exploring its oil shale reserves: for 2008-\n\n2012 as part of the Plan Nationale des Actions Prioritaires (PNAP) the government plans to invest \n\nDH 32 million (US$2008 4.4 million) in the sector and is currently establishing a regulatory \n\nframework. There is also a pilot project for oil shale-based power generation ongoing in Tarfaya. \n\nIn 2004 the main crude oil suppliers have been Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran and Iraq. \n\n- Coal \n\nThe country is heavily dependent on coal imports since the closure of the coal mine of Jerada in 2001. \n\nCoal is mainly imported from the United States, Colombia and South Africa (RECREEE, 2010). \nAccording to the National Energy Strategy 2020-2030 published in 2009 by the government, coal will \n\ncontinue to be the primary fossil fuel used for power generation in the next decades (RECREEE, \n\n2010). \n\n- Natural gas \n\nIdentically to its oil reserves, Morocco?s proven natural gas reserves are small, around 1.5 billion m\n3\n \n\nas of January 1st 2009 (RECREEE, 2010). ONHYM supervises all natural gas related explorations, \nsurveys and drillings. Considered as a strategic platform for energy transit, Morocco plays a major role \n\nin the transportation of gas from Algeria to Spain as the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline links the Hassi \n\nR?mel field in Algeria via Morocco with Spain where it feeds into the European gas grid. \n\nIt is intended that the natural gas share in the TPES reach 20% until 2020. A LNG (liquefied natural \n\ngas) terminal will be built by 2015. It will have an initial capacity of 5 BCM; this option is to be \n\nrealized if supply is secured. This LNG Terminal is planned to be at Jorf Lasfar (Atlantic coast) or \n\nNador (Mediterranean Sea) \u2013 5 BCM in 2015, 10 BCM in 2018 (MEMME, 2009). \n\n- Uranium \n\nMorocco has great quantities of uranium in its phosphates. This resource may well be useful in the \n\nfuture if viable competitive mechanisms are established for its extraction. The estimated availability of \n\nuranium in the Moroccan phosphates, according to IAEA's latest assessments, is of around 6.9 million \n\nton (IAEA, 2010). \n\n \n\n \n\nRenewable Energy Resources \n\n- Wind \n\nMorocco has an excellent wind energy potential (of about 6000MW a year) mainly in the North, and \n\nin the South (MEMEE, 2008b). In Tangier and Tetouan, the annual average wind speed ranges \n\nbetween 9.5m/s and 11 m/s at 40 meters elevation. In Tarfaya, Taza and Dakhla the annual average \n\nwind speed ranges between 7.5 m/s and 9.5 m/s at 40 meters (MEMEE, 2010).  Between 2000 and \n\n2008, more than 50 measurement stations were installed by the Centre de D\u00e9veloppement des Energies \n\nRenouvelables (CDER).

The annual sunshine averages 3000 hours, equivalent to \n\nan almost 5.3 kWh/m\n2\n/day potential (UNCCC, 2010). Figure 5-21 presents the country?s solar \n\npotential.  \n\n \nFigure 5-21 - Morocco solar potential (MEMEE, 2010) \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    62 \n\n \n\n- Geothermal  \n\nThere seems to be some geothermal potential in the northeast of the country and in the Sahara \n\nsedimentary basins (Figure 5-22).

Road transport is by far the main mode of transport, accounting for about 95% of all internal \n\npassenger transport volume, 70% of freight transport and 98% of the sector?s energy use (CIF, 2011). \n\nTable 5-20 presents the length of the main transport networks in 2000 and 2008. \n\nTable 5-20 - Lenght of the main transport networks (Km) (Eurostat, 2010) \n\n2000 2008 \n\nRoads Rail Roads Rail \n\nTotal Motorways Total Motarways \n\n57652 425 1907 57852 866 1907 \n\n \n\nIt was estimated that around 420000 ton of gasoline and 2.2 million ton of diesel were consumed in \n\n2007 by the transport sector. Gasoline and diesel have been of reduced quality and around 30% to \n\n40% of the consumed gasoline in 2007 was leaded and about 95% of the consumed diesel had more \n\nthan 10000 ppm of Sulphur. In 2009 the Government banned leaded gasoline and imposed firm norms \n\non the diesel consumed in the transport sector, including a maximum Sulphur content of 50 ppm (the \n\ndiesel 50 ppm replaced the diesel 350 in February 2009 and the ordinary diesel in April 2009) (World \n\nBank, 2011a). \n\nMoroccan fuel prices are among the highest of the MENA region. The gasoline price is about \n\nUS$1.35/liter and therefore includes a considerable net tax. The diesel price, at about US$0.9/liter is \n\nsomewhat above the cost recovery level (World Bank, 2011a). \n\nBetween 1993 and 2003, the number of cars in circulation increased by 36%. Aside from walking, \n\ntravel in urban areas takes place predominantly in private cars and taxis. Consequently, rush hour \n\ntravel conditions in urban areas are frequently problematic. The Urban Transport Master Plan has \n\nrecognized that in Casablanca more than one-third of the intersections examined are presently very \n\ncongested. Additionally, several indicators point to a substantial intensification in the rate of vehicle \n\nownership (World Bank, 2011a). \n\nTable 5-21 presents the passenger cars (1000) average annual growth rate between 2000 and 2006 and \n\nthe road goods vehicles (1000) average annual growth rate between 2000 and 2004. \n\nTable 5-21 - Number of passenger cars (1000), of road goods vehicles (1000) and of buses \nand coaches (1000) (Eurostat, 2010) \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    64 \n\n \n\n 2000 2002 2004 2006 Average annual \n\ngrowth rate (%) \n\nNumber of passenger cars (1000) 1211 1296 1384 1492 3.5 \n\nNumber of road goods vehicles (1000) 400 428 450 n.a. 3.0 \n\nNumber of buses and coaches (1000) 15 16 16 17 2.1 \n\nNote: n.a. = not available \n\nIn Casablanca, the number of cars is increasing about 4.5% per year on average and is projected to \n\nincrease almost 50% between 2010 and 2020 (World Bank, 2011a). \n\n- Rail infrastructure \n\nTable 5-22 presents the number of locomotives (include tractive railway vehicles with a power of 110 \n\nkW and above at the draw hook equipped with prime mover and motor or with motor only used for \n\nhauling railway vehicles) and goods transport wagons (railway freight wagon normally intended for \n\nthe transport of goods) in 2008.  \n\nTable 5-22- Number of locomotives and goods transport wagons in 2008 (1000) (Eurostat, \n2010) \n\n Number of locomotives (1000) Number of goods transport wagons (1000) \n\n221 6040 \n\n \n\nTable 5-23 presents the rail freight transport (covers any goods moved by rail vehicles, this includes \n\nall packing and equipment, such as containers, swap-bodies or pallets as well as road goods vehicles \n\ncarried by rail). \n\nTable 5-23- Rail freight transport (million tkm) (Eurostat, 2010) \n\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 Average annual growth rate (%) \n\n4650 4973 5563 5873 4986 0.9 \n\n \n\n- Airport infrastructure  \n\nThere are 24 airports in the country: 15 international airports, 6 domestic airports and 3 airports that \n\nserve as secondary platforms (COMET, 2011). Since the 2003 liberalization of air transport, the \n\ncountry has seen several low-cost companies entering the market, and Morocco?s signing of an open \n\nskies agreement with the EU in 2006 has furthered this trend. In 2007 the consumption of kerosene jet \n\nfuels reached 501000 toe (Eurostat, 2010).   \n\nIn 2002, 2008 and 2009 there were 22, 44 and 45 commercial airlines respectively (excluding low-cost \n\nairlines). In 2002 there were 91.3 thousands commercial flights and in 2008 there were 136.1 \n\nthousands (COMET, 2011). \n\n- Maritime transport \n\nThe country has 30 ports, 12 are commercial, 12 are dedicated fishing and 6 pleasure ports. Maritime \n\ntransport accounts for 95% of Morocco?s foreign trade. Casablanca port is the major one and it \n\nhandles nearly 36% of the country?s maritime traffic and approximately 86% of container traffic. The \n\nTanger Med port is another key trade facility. The opening of its first terminal, conceded to APM \n\nTerminals Tangier, has been in July 2007. By the end of April 2008 this port had accommodated \n\nnearly 200 stopovers and treated nearly 275000 twenty-foot containers (COMET, 2011). \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    65 \n\n \n\n5.3.2.2 Industry Sector \n\nThe energy consumption in industry as % of total final energy consumption from 2004 to 2007 is \n\npresented in Figure 5-24. \n\n22.5\n\n23\n\n23.5\n\n24\n\n24.5\n\n25\n\n2004 2005 2006 2007\n\n%\n\nYear\n\nEnergy consumption in industry as % of total final energy \n\nconsumption\n\n \nFigure 5-24 \u2013 Energy consumption in industry as % of total final energy consumption (Eurostat, 2010) \n\nFigure 5-25 presents the industrial sector total energy consumption in 2007.  \n\n69%\n\n2%\n\n20%\n\n9%\n\nTotal energy consumption in industry (1000 toe), 2007\n\nPetroleum products\n\nNatural gas\n\nElectricity\n\nOther*\n\n \n* Other includes solid fuels and renewable energy. \n\nFigure 5-25 \u2013 Total energy consumption in industry (1000 toe), 2007 (Eurostat, 2010)  \n\nIn 2008, on a net calorific value basis, the industrial sector consumed 1912 ktoe of oil products, 73 \n\nKtoe of combustible renewables and waste, 44 ktoe of gas, 35 Ktoe of coal and peat products and 710 \n\nktoe of electricity (IEA, 2011i). \n\nThe energy demand in the industrial sector is concentrated in three main segments: cement, phosphates \n\nand sugar units. Their energy use is estimated to increase substantially in the upcoming decades, from \n\naround 1600 Mtoe in 2005 to 5200 Mtoe in 2030 (CIF, 2011).

Morocco has 75% of the world?s phosphate \n\nreserves, is the world?s leading exporter (28% of the global market) and the third-largest producer \n\n(20% of global production). Phosphate rock is mined in several regions of the country. The most \n\nactively mined area is Khouribga, which is the single largest producing phosphate mine in the world. \n\nThe two open pit mining operations at Khouribga account for nearly 50% of all phosphate rock mined \n\nin the country. The reserves of phosphate rocks are estimated to be approximately 20 billion tons \n\n(GAA, 2008). The Office Ch\u00e9rifien des Phosphates (OCP) has plans to intensify the production \n\ncapacity significantly in the future.

In 2006 the share of oil, coal and coal products, \n\nand natural gas on the emissions of CO2 was, approximately, 61%, 34% and 3%, respectively \n\n(MEMME, 2009b). \n\nThe coal?s share in the total CO2 emissions in recent decades has increased, from 11% in 1980 to 34% \n\nin 2006. This upsurge is connected to the increase of coal consumption for power generation \n\n(MEMME, 2009b). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-29 - CO2 emissions from fuel combustion from 1971 to 2006 (Mt CO2 per year) (MEMME, \n\n2009b) \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    69 \n\n \n\nThe bulk of all CO2 emissions from fuel combustion came from three sectors, as illustrated in Figure \n\n5-30: electricity and heat, transport and industry.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5-30 \u2013 CO2 emissions by sector between 1971 and 2007 (MEMME, 2009b) \n\nThe electricity and heat sector is the largest source of energy-related CO2 emissions. The CO2 \n\nemissions from this sector have been rising substantially as a consequence of both sharp increases in \ndemand and large continuous consumption of coal as the principal input fuel with a small share from \n\nRE sources (hydro and wind power). The transport sector is also very energy intensive and emits \n\nconsiderable CO2 quantities. From 1971 to 2007 the transport sector CO2 emissions, rose almost 500% \n\nand from 1997 to 2007 almost 50% which makes it the fastest-growing source of energy-related CO2 \n\nemissions. In 2007, the CO2 emissions from this sector represented 25% of the total. The industrial \n\nsector emits large amounts of CO2 as well. Within this sector, the energy consumption and the CO2 \n\nemissions are concentrated within the cement, phosphates and sugar units (MEMME, 2009b). \n\nBetween 1971 and 2007 the CO2 emissions per capita almost tripled, going from 0.45 t per capita to \n\n1.3 t per capita, respectively. In the same period, the country?s CO2 emissions per each unit of GDP \n\nincreased almost 50% (MEMME, 2009b). \n\nWhen compared against other countries, the CO2 intensity of the Moroccan economy is above average. \n\nAlthough Morocco has a relatively low level of energy intensity (measured per GDP or per capita), its \n\nextensive consumption of coal means that the CO2 emissions generated from each unit of energy \n\nproduced and consumed are high (MEMME, 2009b). \n\nIn 2006, the Moroccan CO2 emissions intensity was of 3.1 t CO2/toe versus a world average of 2.4 t \n\nCO2/toe. In the same year, for power generation, Moroccan CO2 intensity was of 0.86 t CO2/MWh \n\nversus a world average of 0.57 t CO2/MWh. However, the per capita CO2 emissions in Morocco were \n\nbelow world averages and below averages of all non-Annex 1 countries: in 2006, Morocco had \n\nemissions of about 1.31 tCO2 per capita against the world?s 4.28 tCO2/capita and the 2.44 tCO2/capita \n\nemissions of the non-Annex 1 countries (MEMME, 2009b). \n\nIn 2008 the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion reached 42.09 Mt.

The development \n\nof the PNAP was launched by His Majesty King Mohammed VI on April 15, 2008. The PNAP \n\nrepresents a holistic approach to the country?s energy needs, seeking to enhance energy security and \n\nincrease access, while at the same time lowering CO2 emissions. In a great number of cases, the \n\nactions included (e.g., increase in renewable energy and energy conservation) achieve all goals \n\nsimultaneously (MEMEE, 2008) (CIF, 2009). Key objectives of this ambitious national program \n\ninclude a 600% increase in wind power to reach 20% of power generation and a 15% reduction in \n\nenergy use in buildings, industry and transport by 2020 (CIF, 2009). \n\nThe PNAP is a comprehensive national program representing the efforts and contributions of the ten \n\nmajor Ministries at the national level, among them: Ministry for Energy, Mines, Water and the \n\nEnvironment (MEMEE\n14\n\n), Ministry of Equipment and Transport, Ministry of Agriculture, and the \n\nMinistry of Industry, Commerce and New Technologies. It also holds formal partnerships with the \n\nONE, ADEREE as well as local officials and municipalities. The PNAP procedures are to be \n\nimplemented by 2012 (CIF, 2009). \n\nBy March 2009, the \u201cNew energy strategy\u201d was adopted, aiming to provide sufficient and reliable \n\nenergy to the economy and to the population as well as to prevent any harmful effect on the \n\nenvironment stemming from energy supply and uses (UNCCC, 2010). These goals rest on five \n\nstrategic axes:  \n\n- Security of supply with diversification of fuel types and origins; \n\n- Access and availability of energy for all segments of society at reasonable prices; \n\n- Deployment of domestic energy sources, principally renewable, and the intensification of \nhydrocarbons exploration and oil shale valorisation; \n\n- Promotion of energy efficiency; and \n\n- Regional energy integration among the Euro-Mediterranean markets (UNCCC, 2010). \n\n                                                      \n\n14\n The MEMEE is responsible for the development and implementation of government policy in the areas of \n\nenergy, mines and geology and for the control of other sectors that depend on its authority. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    73 \n\n \n\n5.4.1 Energy Players \n\nThe country?s energy industry is composed of public and private players. The National Mines and \n\nHydrocarbons Authority is the main public authority in the energy sector. This Authority resulted from \n\nthe merger of the following different public entities:  \n\n- Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (ONYHM);  \n\n- Bureau de Recherches et de Participations Mini\u00e8res (BPRM);  \n\n- Office National de l\u2019Electricit\u00e9 (ONE); \n\n- and the National Agency for Development of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \n(ADEREE\n\n15\n), former Centre de D\u00e9veloppement des Energies Renouvelables (CDER) (AGICI, \n\n2011) (UNCTAD, 2011). \n\nThe main private companies operational in the energy field are:  \n\n- Moroccan Refining Company (SAMIR);  \n\n- Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline Management Company (METRAGAZ);  \n\n- Jorf Lasfar Energy Company (JLEC);  \n\n- Tahaddart Electricity Company (EET);  \n\n- Detroit Wind Energy Company (CED);  \n\n- LYDEC;  \n\n- REDAL; and \n\n- AMENDIS (AGICI, 2011). \n\n5.4.2 Market Structure \n\nThe oil and gas sectors are controlled by the National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining (ONHYM), \n\na state-owned company established in 2005. ONHYM is an independent financially autonomous \n\npublic institution; its activities are supervised by the state to guarantee compliance with the Act of \n\nParliament under with which it was created, principally with regard to its tasks and functions, and to \n\nensure the application of the law (Law 33-01) and regulations relating to public institutions in general. \n\nONHYM is subject to financial supervision by the state, as applicable to public institutions (ONHYM, \n\n2011). \n\nThe Moroccan oil refinery (Mohammedia) is operated by SAMIR, which is owned by the Saudi \n\ncompany Corral Petroleum (OBG, 2011). \n\nThe country?s power generation, was formerly exclusively operated by the state owned ONE. Since \n\nthe late 1990s, some independent private producers (JLEC, EET and CED) contribute to the national \n\nelectric generation by supplying the power exclusively to ONE through Power Purchase Agreements. \n\nThe ONE is responsible for the power transmission. The power distribution is mainly run by the ONE \n\nand some private operators in the big cities of the country (LYDEC in Casablanca, REDAL in Rabat \n\nand AMENDIS in Tanger/Tetouan) (IAEA, 2010). \n\nThe Moroccan policy for power supply is drawn by the ONE and is submitted for approval to the \n\nMinistry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment (IAEA, 2010). \n\n                                                      \n\n15\n ADEREE aims to contribute to the implementation of government policy on renewable energy and energy \n\nefficiency. \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    74 \n\n \n\n5.4.3 Programs and Measures to Promote Renewable Energy \n\nSince the creation, in the early 1980s, of the CDER, which is now ADEREE, Moroccan governments \n\nhave shown determination to promote RE (UNCTAD, 2011). \n\nPresently, the RE policy is in its generalized implementation stage with large renewable energy and \n\nenergy efficiency programs, held by national and international institutions and banks (UNCTAD, \n\n2011). \n\nMorocco is developing RE with the objective to increase their share in the primary energy \n\nconsumption to reach 12% in 2020 and more than 20% in 2030 (UNCCC, 2010). The country has the \n\nnecessary resources to achieve these goals as its potential, mainly in solar and wind energy, is \n\nextensive and several strategies were drawn up to accelerate the implementation of utility-scale solar \n\nand wind projects (UNCCC, 2010).  \n\nA vast Solar Power Program was launched in 2009, with the objective to achieve 2000 MW by 2020 \n\non five sites. The first 500 MW will be commissioned in 2015. This program is projected to prevent \n\nthe emission of 3.7 million ton of CO2 per year and avoid 1 million toe of fossil fuels and electricity \n\nimports. The total project investment is evaluated in 9 billion US dollars (UNCCC, 2010). \n\nAdditionally, the country launched the Development Program of the Moroccan market for solar water \n\nheaters (PROMASOL) that includes the installation of 440000 m\n2\n and 1.7 million m\n\n2\n of thermal solar \n\nsensors in 2012 and in 2020 respectively. The thermal energy is projected to reach 1190 GWh/yr by \n\n2020 and prevent the emission of 920 kton of CO2/yr (AMDI, 2011). \n\nTo enhance the country?s capacity to successfully implement the solar projects the government \n\ncreated, in January 2010, two new institutions: the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (Agence \n\nMarocaine de l\u2019Energie Solaire, MASEN) with the aim of conducting feasibility studies on particular \n\ntechnologies; and the Energy Investments Company (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Investissements Energ\u00e9tiques, SIE) \n\nwith the purpose of attracting and finance profitable private energy projects (UNCCC, 2010). \n\nSimilarly, a Wind Power Program aiming to total 2000 MW by 2020 was launched. At present, 280 \n\nMW are provided by existing wind farms, 720 MW are under development and 1000 MW will be built \n\non five new sites. The goal of this project is to avoid 5.6 ton of CO2 emissions and 1.5 toe of energy \n\nimports. The whole cost of this project investment is estimated at 3.5 billion US dollars (UNCCC, \n\n2010). \n\nBy 2020 the national installed capacity is projected to reach 14580 MW, according to the Minister of \n\nEnergy, Mines, Water and Environment. Of this capacity, 42% is expected to be fulfilled by solar, \n\nwind and hydroelectricity, each representing 14%. Within the same period it is also projected that \n\nnuclear energy will contribute with about 7% of the installed capacity (UNCCC, 2010). \n\n5.4.4 Programs and Measures to Promote Energy Efficiency \n\nEnergy efficiency is a key priority in Morocco?s strategy to minimize energy dependency and ensure \n\nits optimal consumption. The country?s goals are to perform energy savings between 12% and 15% in \n\n2020 and to expand it 20% by 2030 (UNCCC, 2010).  \n\nIn order to include energy efficiency in their regulatory frameworks, agreements were signed with the \n\nfollowing strategic ministries: industry, transport, housing, agriculture, interior, and tourism along \n\nwith regional bodies. \n\nAction plans have been set up in all main sectors such as the promotion of:  \n\n- CHP and RE for power generation in industry; \n\n- Assistance to tertiary and residential sectors to moderate electricity consumption; \n\n- Improved modern public transportation and better management of urban traffic to lower \npersonal vehicles use; \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    75 \n\n \n\n- Standardization and normalization to help consumers to purchase clean and efficient energy \nequipment;   \n\n- Efficient irrigation systems in agriculture, the use of biomass and solar energy for drying and \nrefrigerating products to save energy and water; \n\n- Awareness campaigns for the large public and specific users to encourage the use of lower \nenergy consumption equipment and household appliances and to encourage public \n\ntransportation use; and \n\n- EE in building practices to enhance energy savings - Morocco has introduced a national \nprogram called \u201cEnergy Efficiency Codes in Residential Buildings and Energy Efficiency \n\nImprovement in Commercial and Hospital Buildings in Morocco\u201d. This project is run by \n\nADEREE and other institutional partners. The objective of the program is to launch \n\nmandatory minimum energy efficiency performance requirements by means of a building \n\ncode. This is expected to help the country bring its own laws and regulations in line. The \n\nproject comprises the development of guidelines for technicians and professionals in hospitals, \n\nhotels, services, and housing companies for the integration of solar water systems. 32 health \n\ncenters, 8 hospitals, and hotels have been selected to serve as example objectives (STW, \n\n2011). \n\nTo boost the implementation of the former plans, the country launched favourable conditions to \n\nstimulate national and foreign investors and operators. For better visibility of individuals or companies \n\ninvesting in the country, attractive legislative and regulatory texts were launched or are being enacted. \n\nParticular laws concerning renewable energies and energy efficiency supported by the creation of \n\ndedicated Agencies has been promulgated. An Energy Development Funds with 1 billion US dollars \n\ncapital was launched to support RE and EE projects (AMDI, 2011).  \n\n5.4.5 Climate Change \n\nMorocco ratified the major international conventions on the environment. In 1992, Morocco joined the \n\nUN?s Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, the Rio de Janeiro summit), which \n\nlead to numerous major agreements such as the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, \n\nthe Agenda 21, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN?s Framework Convention on \n\nClimate Change (UNFCCC), followed by the Johannesburg Summit in 2002 ( OBG, 2011). \n\nThe kingdom was a signatory of UNFCCC in 1995 and of the Annex 2 of the Kyoto Protocol in 2002. \n\nEven though not obliged to reduce its carbon emissions, the country planned a legal framework to \n\nprotect its environment and promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. The kingdom hosted the \n\nseventh Conference of the Parties in Marrakech (MEMEE, 2009) (OBG, 2011). \n\nIn 2001 Morocco published its first National Communication to the UNFCCC and in 2010 the country \n\npublished the second National Communication. \n\nMorocco introduced several climate change coping and mitigation mechanisms in many of its national \n\nplans as the reforestation of 50000 ha per year until 2014 (OBG, 2011). \n\nThe kingdom embraced the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as an opportunity \n\nto attract investments in cleaner technologies. The Moroccan CDM portfolio arose from the first \n\nmitigation assessments comprised in Morocco?s First National Communication. These assessments led \n\nto the elaboration of a National Action Plan for the reduction of GHG emissions. From then on, the \n\nCDM portfolio has been improved and extended, within the framework of continuous and focused \n\nefforts. Morocco?s National Action Plan takes into account 25 projects, in view of an estimated \n\nevolution of GHG emissions in the country by 2020. The Plan and the projects consider national \n\npolicies, programs, and strategies, as well as Morocco?s particular circumstance and conditions. The \n\n25 projects were planned by Government departments, involved public and private institutions, or \n\nhave been set out in close cooperation with their managerial staff and officers. In 2006, the CDM \n\nportfolio comprised many projects with significant potential for reducing GHG emissions focused on \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    76 \n\n \n\nthe promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy, and on the reduction of energy waste \n\n(UNEP, 2011).  \n\n5.4.6 Sustainable Development \n\nSince its participation in the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, the country has been in the process of \n\nimplementing the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and \n\nDevelopment. As part of the application of these recommendations in 1992 and within the context of \n\nglobal sustainability and human development initiatives, Morocco established a new strategy based on \n\nan integrated approach to development (UNCTAD, 2011).  \n\nBy May 2003 Morocco introduced a law (Law 11-03) on the protection of the environment. This law \n\nprovides general principles of national policy on environmental protection and among these principles \n\nis the integration of environmental concerns into all policies.  \n\nAlong with the PNAP and the \u201cNew Energy Strategy\u201d to provide sufficient and reliable energy to the \n\neconomy and to the population as well as to prevent any harmful effect on the environment stemming \n\nfrom energy supply and uses, Morocco has introduced other development strategies to achieve its \n\nenvironmental goals, namely: the National Strategy for Environmental Protection and Sustainable \n\nDevelopment, the implementation of the Plan for the Environment (PANE), the 2020 Strategy for rural \n\nDevelopment, and the introduction of the National Initiative for Human Development (NIHD) \n\n(UNCTAD, 2011). \n\nIn 2009, determined to approach the challenges of protecting its environment, the kingdom drafted the \n\nNational Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development (OBG, 2011) (UNCTAD, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    77 \n\n \n\n6 Final Remarks \n\nThe future is naturally uncertain and always will be. Trends in economic growth (and therefore energy \n\nuse and related emissions of CO2) and technology development are difficult to predict. Still, concerns \n\nabout energy security, the need to meet the predictable growing demand of energy and the threat of \n\nclimate change, all pose major challenges to energy decision makers in Morocco.   \n\nOne thing is certain: to reduce energy related CO2 emissions worldwide and in Morocco specifically, \n\nthere is no single solution; instead, a wide range of solutions is necessary and it will involve different \n\nchoices by numerous stakeholders. \n\nThe IEA and the international community in general agree that Energy Efficiency improvements, the \n\nincrease of Renewable Energy deployment, Nuclear Power and CCS technologies are central options \n\nwithin a portfolio to achieve the necessary sustainability targets in the most cost-effective way. In \n\nMorocco, all of these options are being considered, including CCS within the COMET project.  \n\nEven disregarding the output data provided from the TIMES modeling of the Moroccan energy \n\nsystem, it is possible to draw some general considerations - as to the CCS option for Morocco - based \n\non the information collected to run the model itself. Such considerations will be discussed within the \n\nfollowing paragraphs.  \n\nAs by 2020 the national power installed capacity is projected to reach 14580 MW and 42% of this \n\ncapacity is anticipated to be fulfilled by solar, wind and hydroelectricity, each representing 14%; and \n\nsince it is also projected that nuclear energy will contribute with about 7% of the installed capacity;, \n\nthis means that, in this scenario, fossil fuels and biomass will have to fulfill 51% of the installed \n\ncapacity (Figure 6-1) and account for approximately 7436 MW in 2020 which corresponds to a 78% \n\nincrease in the thermal installed capacity relatively to 2009 (4166 MW).  \n\nNuclear\n\n7%\n\nFossil fuels/ \n\nbiomass 51%\n\nSolar\n\n14%\n\nWind\n\n14%\n\nHydro\n\n14%\n\nRenewables \n\n42%\n\nInstalled Capacity in 2020\n\n \nFigure 6-1\u2013 Projected installed capacity by 2020 \n\nIn this scenario, the power sector in Morocco will continue to be highly dependent on fossil fuels. The \n\nperspective that the thermal installed capacity is to be substantially expanded within the following \n\nyears and the fact that coal is expected to continue to be the primary fossil fuel for power generation in \n\nthe next decades (according to the National Energy Strategy 2020-2030 published by the government \n\nin 2009) reinforces the necessity to consider CCS technologies for decarbonizing the power sector to \n\nsome extent. This may imply the retrofitting of the existing units of the larger power plants like the \n\nJorf Lasfar (JLEC) with CCS technologies, or the introduction of these technologies within the \n\nprojected new units of Jorf Lasfar or within new facilities such as that of Safi.  \n\nBased on the information collected, within the industrial sector, the cement subsector also represents a \n\nsignificant opportunity for CCS deployment since the cement production is expected to grow 244% \n\nbetween 2010 and 2030 and that this is already the industrial largest source of CO2 emissions in the \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    78 \n\n \n\ncountry. Additionally, the IEA considers CCS technologies to be the main solution to achieve deep \n\nemission cuts within the cement industry.  \n\nStill, capturing CO2 is an emerging technology within the power sector, not yet demonstrated on a \n\ncommercial scale and CO2 capture technologies for the cement industry are not likely to be \n\ncommercially available before 2020, since, before then, further research and pilot tests are required to \n\ngain practical experience with these technologies, according to the IEA. \n\nYet, undoubtedly, if CCS technologies are to be part of the country?s CO2 emission reduction portfolio \n\nin the future - along with the projected EE improvements and further RE deployment - several \n\nchallenges must be overcame in view of both the current CCS technologies intrinsic downsides (such \n\nas EE penalties, additional costs and the fact that these technologies are not entitled as CDM project \n\nactivity) and the Moroccan circumstances. \n\nFor instance, if CCS technologies are to be deployed in the country: \n\n- The fact that currently Morocco is not obliged to reduce its carbon emissions by any means \nsuggests that the introduction of appropriate economic incentives such as tax treatment or \n\nother mechanisms are to play an extraordinary role;  \n\n- There is value in creating a regulatory, legal and accounting framework for CCS in Morocco, \nsince at present there is no framework for regulating CCS projects in the country. Indeed, \n\ninvestments in these technologies will only occur if there are adequate financial incentives \n\nand/or regulatory mandates;  \n\n- Given the scale of investment required to deploy CCS, the country ought to foster \ninternational co-operation in order to decrease projects costs; and  \n\n- The Moroccan government should dedicate resources to disseminate information since public \noutreach is critical. \n\n \n\nMARKAL/TIMES outputs \n\nIt is important to remark that to run the model several assumptions had to be made, owing to the \n\nunavailability of some important data and lack of time, which means that an ongoing process to collect \n\ndata and improve the model is required for better insights.  \n\nOn the supply side, missing input data includes, among others, detailed information on the actual \n\navailable potential of biomass for power generation.  \n\nOn the demand side, missing input data includes information on, among others:  \n\n- The number of houses with air conditioning; \n\n- The number of square meters for commercial activities and this sector energy consumption by \ntype of fuel; \n\n- The energy consumption trend of the cement and phosphate industries as well as the type of \nfuel consumed by the different industrial activities; and \n\n- Load curve profiles for several months. \n\nAfter the submission of the input data, for the first modeling, important missing data has been \n\nidentified. This data will be used to improve the model later in the project. It includes the following \n\ninformation: \n\n- Wind technical potential (estimated to total 25000 MW); \n\n- 200 feasible micro hydro power projects (ranging from 15 to 100 kW). \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    79 \n\n \n\n7 Conclusions \n\nThe energy demand in Morocco has rapidly increased over the last years. This upward trend is \n\nexpected to continue in the coming decades, driven by a strong economic development and increasing \n\npopulation. As the energy demand is expected to grow, increasing concerns over energy security and \n\nenvironmental sustainability issues arise in Morocco. Indeed, it is estimated that by 2020, the primary \n\nenergy and electricity consumption will double compared to their level in 2008 and that by 2030 these \n\nconsumptions will be three and four times greater, respectively. \n\nIn the seventies the power sector depended on a considerable extent on hydroelectricity. However, \n\nfrom then on, the Moroccan power supply has been consistently heavily based on fossil fuels, and as \n\nthere are limited fossil energy sources available within the country, Morocco is extremely dependent \n\non energy imports and is the largest energy importer of North Africa. In 2008, the Moroccan net \n\nenergy import amounted to 96%.  \n\nAlongside its energy demand growth, the CO2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion have also \n\nincreased. In fact, the Moroccan CO2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion have more than doubled \n\nbetween 1995 and 2008 reaching, by then, 49.09 Mt.      \n\nConversely to its fossil fuels unavailability, Morocco possesses substantial domestic unexploited \n\nRenewable Energy Sources, mainly solar and wind energy.  \n\nIn order to sustain the on-going energy demand upsurge, decrease its exposure to international \n\nvolatility commodity prices, improve its energy trade balance and reduce its energy related \n\nenvironmental impacts, Morocco has introduced several strategies in order to boost the deployment of \n\nEnergy Efficiency measures within several sectors and increase the penetration of Renewable Energy \n\nwithin its energy supply portfolio.  \n\nNational targets are to perform energy savings between 12% and 15% in 2020 and to expand it to 20% \n\nby 2030 as well as to increase the share of Renewables in the primary energy supply mix to reach 12% \n\nin 2020 and more than 20% in 2030. The Nuclear Power option is also being discussed by the \n\nMoroccan government as a future possibility for cleaner power generation.  \n\nThe Moroccan thermal generation capacity is estimated to expand 78% until 2020, in relation to 2009 \n\nand coal is expected to continue to be the primary fossil fuel for power generation in the next decades. \n\nWithin the industrial sector, the cement, phosphates and sugar units \u2013 the most energy and CO2 \n\nemission intensive units in this sector \u2013 are expected to more than triple their energy use in 2030 in \n\nrelation to 2005.  \n\nIn view of such factors, it seems reasonable to at least consider debating the CCS option to \n\ndecarbonise, on some extent in the future, the Moroccan power and industrial sectors. Will CCS - \n\nalong with EE improvements, greater penetration of RES in the TPES - be a viable solution for \n\nMorocco within the future?  \n\nAs it is known, advancing towards a low carbon future, in the most cost-effective way, requires a \n\nweighing of the different CO2 abatement options available and a far-sighted approach. This means that \n\nthe CCS option must be weighed against other carbon abatement options such as EE improvements, \n\nfurther RES penetration and nuclear deployment since each of these options entails a distinctive set of \n\nco-benefits, costs and risks that must be considered. Indeed, other things being equal, if one option is \n\nto bear a lighter burden, others will be required to do proportionately if Morocco is to effectively \n\nrespond to the risks of climate change without compromising its economic development.   \n\nThe COMET project - which goal is to study the techno-economic feasibility of integrating CO2 \n\ntransport and storage infrastructures in the West Mediterranean region \u2013 will provide some insights \n\nconcerning the possibility of deploying CCS technologies in Morocco in the future in an integrated \n\napproach.  \n\nIn view of the COMET project, one thing is acknowledge beforehand: a CCS integrated approach, \n\ncompared to a standalone CCS project in one of the three countries involved, implicates \n\ninteroperability issues but results in economic advantages and other benefits.  \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    80 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    81 \n\n \n\n \n\n8 Future Work \n\nAs previously stated, to run the model, several assumptions have been made, owing to the \n\nunavailability of some important data and lack of time due to COMET project commitments. \n\nTherefore, within the context of the COMET project and the modeling of the Moroccan energy \n\nsystem, future work includes the gathering and introduction of important missing input data in order to \n\nimprove the model so as to better weigh alternative courses of actions in an integrated approach.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    82 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMorocco towards a low-carbon economy: the role of energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon capture and storage \n\nRita da Penha Gon\u00e7alves Pereira Machado    83 \n\n \n\nReferences  \n\nChapter 2 \n\n?
