It is divided in an \nintroductory part where the  background concepts and the \ngeological setting of the study area are presented, followed by \nthe research work carried out in this master thesis project. The \nstudied  samples, the methods and  the techniques applied are \ndescribed, followed by the presentation of the main results and \ntheir discussion, concluding  on their mineralogical and \ngeochemical characterization and significance. The  samples \ncame from several mud volcanoes, on three different geological \nand tectonic settings of the Gulf of Cadiz. This mineralogical and \ngeochemical characterization of the authigenic carbonates show \nthe methane derived  origin, especially the C and O  isotopes, as \nresulting  from anaerobic oxidation of methane  in shallow \nsediments and permit to  divide the samples in three main group \nbased  on mineralogy and morphology: chimneys, crusts and \nconcretions. The data obtained compared with the  literature \nmodel proposed, permit to prove  the hypothesis about the \nformation processes of the three type. On the different type of \ncarbonates is possible to  recognize  the influence of the MOW on \nthe oxidation and bio-erosion of the  chimneys and gas hydrates \ninfluence on two samples from the Michael Ivanov Mud Volcano. \nIt is possible, due the isotopic data, move hypothesis on age  of \nthe three different type of carbonate, in particular has been \npossible to distinguish between the recent formation of the \nconcretions and older formation of the chimneys.\n\nkeywords\n\nabstract\n\n\n\nIndex\nFigures Index             iii\n\nTables Index             viii\n\nChapter 1: Introduction          1\n\nChapter 2: Theoretical Background       8\n\n2.1 Carbonate Rocks          8\n\n 2.1.1 Mineralogy         8\n\n 2.1.2 Classification of carbonate rocks     9\n\n2.2 Authigenic Carbonates         16\n\n2.3 Fluid escape structures        24\n\n2.3.1 Cold Seepages        24\n\n2.3.2 Mud Volcanoes         29\n\n2.3.3 Pockmarks          30\n\n2.4 Chemiosynthetic Fauna         32\n\n2.4.1 Gas hydrates and chemosynthetic biota at cold seeps   34\n\nChapter 3: The Gulf of Cadiz         37\n\n3.1 Study Area          37\n\n3.2 Geological Setting         37 \n\n3.3 Oceanographic setting        41\n\n3.4 Carbonate Chimneys         42\n\n3.5 Carbonate Crusts          44\n\n3.6 Mud Volcanoes          45\n\nChapter 4: Materials           48\n\n4.1 Cruises            50\n\nCruise TTR 14          50\n\nCruise TTR 15         51\n\nCruise TTR 16         53\n\nCruise METEOR 86/5        53\n\nChapter 5: Methods           58 \n\n5.1 Thin Sections           58\n\n5.1.1 What is a petrographic thin section?     58\n\ni\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Thin Section Preparation Systems    58\n\n5.2 X-ray diffraction          59\n\n5.2.1 X-ray Generation and Properties     60\n\n5.2.2 Lattice Planes and Bragg's Law     60 \n\n5.2.3 Powder Diffraction       61\n\n5.2.4 X-ray Crystallography       62\n\n5.2.5 MacDiff 4.2.6        62\n\n5.3 Geochemistry          64 \n\n5.3.1 LECO C, O, N and S elemental analysis   64 \n\n5.3.2 Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes     65\n\n5.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)     66 \n\n5.4.1 Fundamental Principles of Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\n(SEM)           67\n\n5.4.2 Applications         68\n\nChapter 6: Results           69\n\n6.1 Samples description         69 \n\n6.2 Petrography          73\n\n6.3 XRD            78\n\n6.3.1 Total Mineral Composition      78\n\n6.3.2 Carbonate Content        84\n\n6.4 Isotopes           87\n\nChapter 7: Discussion           96\n\n7.1 Types of authigenic carbonates       96\n\n7.2 Methane-derived origin of these carbonates    97\n\n7.3 Relative formation ages         101\n\n7.4 Formation model          102\n\nChapter 8: Conclusions           104 \n\nReferences            106\n\nAnnex I   R Statistic Script        116\n\nAnnex II    GCD kit extension        118\n\nii\n\n\n\nFigures Index\nFigure 1: The Gulf of Cadiz.

Methane from hydrate created during the free-gas expulsion phase \nkeeps the  methane in solution in the migrating pore water at saturation concentration, \nsupporting chemosynthetic  biota in the pockmark, until all the hydrate is removed in solution. \nThis process may continue for thousands of years, with only moderate amounts of hydrate \nand concentration of methane  in solution in the pore water entering the chimney from below. \n(Foucher et. al, 2007).............................................................................................................32\n\nFigure 10: Schematic  representation of the control of methane concentration beneath the seabed \n\niii\n\n\n\nby the initial  concentration  of methane in  solution in upwardly migrating pore water, the \npresence  of hydrate, and sulfate in the seawater. The concentration of dissolved methane in \nthe rising pore water controls the depth at which hydrate begins to form. If it is less than the \nlowest value of methane solubility, then  all  previously formed  hydrate will be removed, but \nthe rate ofremoval depends upon the degree to which the pore water is undersaturated and \nthe rate of pore-water flow ( Foucher et. al 2007)..................................................................35\n\nFigure 11: Tectonic map of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz (Medialdea et al, 2009) showing the main outcropping \nand very shallow diapirs, faults, mud volcanoes and mud-carbonate mounds.

Is related to three different projects:\n\n\u2022 the \u201dStratigraphic and structural control on fluid migration and related carbonate \n\nprecipitation along conduits\u201d project.  This  project addresses the study of modern \n\nand ancient carbonate conduits  and chimneys recovered in different, offshore \n\nand onshore geologic contexts, as  the Northern Apennines, the Adriatic Sea, the \n\nemerged northern part of the Crotone basin (Calabria) and the Gulf of Cadiz. The \n\nstudy aims  to constrain the nature of the authigenic carbonate samples  and to \n\ninvestigate their proposed origin as methane-derived carbonates, based on their \n\nsimilarity with other occurrences  but not yet totally confirmed. This type of \n\nsamples  are frequently interpreted as  surface indicators  of shallow or deep \n\nhydrocarbons  reservoirs  and can therefore be useful for exploration purposes. \n\nAs the leakage of fluids  up to the surface, previously needs  the achievement of \n\nfavorable condition leading to expulsion from  source rocks, migration and \n\naccumulation within stratigraphic and structural traps. This  project, and this \n\nthesis, are developed in collaboration with the University of Bologna (Italy).\n\n\u2022  The Euromargins/Eurocores  programme project MVSEIS \u201cTectonic control, \n\ndeep crustal structure and fluid escape pathways in the Gulf of Cadiz mud \n\nvolcano field\u201d started on June 2003 and integrates  Portuguese, Spanish, \n\nBelgium and French teams  under the coordination of the Portuguese team  (L. M. \n\nPinheiro). The Portuguese work package has been founded by the Portuguese \n\nScience Foundation - FCT. The objective of the MVSEIS project is to investigate \n\nthe deep crustal structure, the sedimentary section and sediment dynamics, the \n\ntectonic control and the detailed geometry of the fluid escape pathways in this \n\narea with active mud volcanism and cold seeps, using a multidisciplinary \n\n1\n\n\n\napproach. The multidisciplinary approach gives  the opportunity to link the \n\ntectonic, sedimentological, geochemical and biological processes  associated \n\nwith the mud volcanism and gas seepage.\n\n\u2022 The SWIMGLO project: \u201cThe Gloria-SWIM plate boundary Faults connection and \n\nits importance on the propagation of tectonic deformation and deep\u201d (PTDC/\n\nMAR/100522/2008). The SWIM Fault system  constitutes  a 600 km  long active \n\nplate boundary between the Rif-Tell continental plate boundary and the Gloria \n\nFault plate boundary.  Mud volcanoes, the loci of chemosynthetic biological \n\ncommunities, are found in association with the SWIM Faults. The \n\ninterconnectivity between chemosynthetic ecosystems  in the Gulf of Cadiz can \n\nbe mediated by local oceanographic processes. This  project will investigate the \n\ngeological connection between the SWIM Faults and the Gloria Fault, the \n\nchanneling of fluids along the SWIM Faults  in the deep oceanic domain and the \n\nchemosynthetic communities along the SWIM Faults and SWIM-Gloria \n\nconnection. The geological, chemical and biological data will contribute to clarify \n\ni) the role of trans-continental-oceanic faults in the dispersal of deep-sea \n\nchemosynthetic organisms across  the Atlantic, ii) the fluids exhalated along this \n\nplate boundary and, iii) the geometry and seismicity of the connection of two \n\nplate boundaries that are merging into each other at Present.\n\nThe samples  analyzed in this  thesis have been collected during four different \n\ncruises. Three of them  are Training-Through-Research (or TTR) cruises, in \n\nparticular the TTR-14, TTR-15 and TTR-16, that operated largely in the area. The \n\nfourth cruise is the METEOR cruise M86/5. \n\nThe subject of this thesis  are Authigenic Carbonate formation, in the Gulf of Cadiz. \n\nIn particular three type of authigenic carbonates  have been considered in this \n\nwork: chimneys, crusts and concretion (usually associated with mud volcanoes \n\nstructures). Those samples came from 4 different cruises list before, that operate \n\nin different parts of the Gulf. So have been analyzed in this  work four different data \n\nsets of samples colected from three different settings:\n\n\u2022 On the Mediterranean Outflow Water channel in front of Gibraltar\n\n\u2022 On the deep portuguese mad volcano Michael Ivanov MV\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u2022 On the Marocco margin:  Vernadesky ridge\n\n    Pen Duick Enscarpment\n\n    Mercator Mud Volcano \n\n    Merkator Mud Volcano\n\nThe main objective of this thesis  is the identification and characterization of \n\nauthigenic carbonate associated with cold seeps from these three different \n\nsettings in the area of the Gulf of Cadiz. In particular prove, using mineralogy and \n\ngeochemistry, that the three types of carbonates  that have been considered in this \n\nthesis are actually different between them and that are clearly recognizable on the \n\nbasis of the analysis  done. Prove also that is possible to define trends  of evolution \n\nand characterization for the three types of carbonate and for the samples  in each \n\ngroup. Another important objective in this master degree thesis, is  to investigate \n\nand try to relate the geochemical and mineralogical characteristics  to the \n\nformational processes of the three types  of authigenic carbonate considered in this \n\nthesis. After reaching all the previous  objectives, this master degree thesis \n\naddress  itself to prove that the authigenic carbonate considered are, in all the \n\ncases methane derived.\n\nThe characterization of the samples  has been done using geochemical properties \n\nand mineralogy of the samples to identify and distinguish the different types  of \n\nsamples. \n\nBased on the characterization of the carbonate samples  from  these different \n\nsettings, the composition and formation processes  of authigenic carbonates will be \n\nconstrained. Three types of authigenic carbonates have been considered in this \n\nwork: chimneys, crusts  and concretions (usually associated with mud volcanoes \n\nand similar structures).\n\nIn this  study, the samples were characterized by petrographic and geochemical \n\nanalysis through: \n\n\u2022 Thin section petrographic description\n\n\u2022 Scanning electro microscopy analysis\n\n\u2022 X-ray diffraction (XRD)\n\n\u2022 Carbon and Oxygen stable isotopes\n\n3\n\n\n\n\u2022 Chemical analysis of Carbonate content and Total Organic Carbon content\n\nArea\n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz, situated in the south-west of Europe, is a very important area of \n\nthe Atlantic ocean. This gulf is \n\nconfined in the North by Spain and \n\nPortugal southern coasts and on \n\nthe south by Moroccan atlantic \n\ncoasts. The most characteristic \n\nlimits are the East and West-ones: \n\nthey are respectively the Gibraltar \n\nStrait and the open Atlantic Ocean. \n\nThis  region is  the area in which the \n\nwater of Mediterranean sea mixes \n\nwith water from  the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nT h e i m p o r t a n c e o f t h e \n\noceanographic literature and marine \n\ngeological studies  on the Gulf of Cadiz continental margin (SW Europe) emanates \n\nof its proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar, a point of singular geographic interest, \n\nbeing it the place where the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea interchange \n\ntheir water masses, starting a thermodynamical system that is  one of the most \n\nimportant in the global water circulation, and where the Western Mediterranean \n\nAlpidic Orogen (Betic and Rif Mountain range) meet through the Gibraltar Tectonic \n\nArch. Therefore, this zone has  been object of numerous studies  in a large variety \n\nof disciplines.\n\nGeologically speaking, the Gulf of Cadiz is located at the front of the Betic-Rifian \n\nArc. It has  had a very complex geological history and undergone several episodes \n\nof rifting, compression and strike-slip motion, since the Triassic (Wilson et al., \n\n1996; Maldonado et al., 1999). The westward migration of the Gibraltar arc during \n\nthe Mesozoic caused the Gulf of Cadiz to form as a forearc basin (Maldonado et \n\nal., 1999). In the forearc basin, due to different movement, rotation and \n\ngravitational processes resulted in the implantation of the Gibraltar Olistostrome. \n\nThis  is  a chaotic consequence of units  that involve a huge volume of mud and salt \n\n4\n\nFigure 1: the Gulf of Cadiz. (Source: google earth)\n\n\n\ndiapirism of Triassic salt units  and undercompacted Early-Middle Miocene plastic \n\nmarls (Maldonado et al. 1999).\n\nThroughout this area, pockmarks, extensive mud volcanism, carbonate mounds \n\nand chimney structures related to hydrocarbon rich fluid venting and mud diapirism \n\nare observed (Ivanov et al., 2000; Somoza et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003). \n\nAt the East part of the Gulf of Cadiz it is possible to observe a large NE-SW \n\ndiapiric ridge, the Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge (GDR), that runs from  the shelf \n\nbreak up to 1200 m  water depth. This ridge controls  the orientation of the main \n\nchannel of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) undercurrent. The GDR is \n\ncomprises  a series  of wide sub-circular conical mounds surrounded by ring-\n\nshaped seafloor depressions. Most of these depressions are filled by contourite \n\ndeposits  as  results  of the MOW undercurrent interaction with the seafloor. Some of \n\nthem, mainly on the right side of the main MOW channel, are developed into \n\nsediment \u201cshadows\u201d, formed on the down-current side of the mounds  and with \n\nasymmetrical moats (Kenson et al., 2006 ).\n\nThesis Outline\n\nThis thesis has been divided in 8 chapters.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction. This  is the chapter that you are reading now, it describes \n\nthe work, the subject and objectives of this thesis. It also contains a breve general \n\nand simple description of the area of interest and of the work that has  been done \n\nto arrive at the objectives of this master thesis. \n\nChapter 2: Theoretical Background. In this  section I have reviewed all the \n\nnecessary background knowledge on the carbonates petrography, fluid escapes \n\nprocesses  and structures to arrive to the conclusions. Here will be described all \n\nthe main the formation process, environments and the mineralogy of this  kind of \n\nrocks. \n\nThen I\u2019ll review the Authigenic Carbonates: those are exactly the type of carbonate \n\nrocks  studied in this  thesis. Is  possible to identify different types  of Authigenic \n\ncarbonates and especially Methane Derived Authigenic Carbonate. Those are \n\ndeeply related with cold seeps  and hydrothermal vents phenomenon that are \n\n5\n\n\n\ntreated in the follower part of the chapter. In the end let\u2019s  do a little survey on the \n\nsignificance and importance os the  chemiosynthetic fauna.\n\nChapter 3: Gulf of Cadiz. This  chapter describes  the settings of the area both \n\ngeological and oceanographic, description of processes  and of the main type of \n\nauthigenic carbonates  present in the area and that are analyzed in this  thesis. Will \n\nbe described the formation and main geology of the gulf because it is  important to \n\ndiscriminate the composition of the samples and of the rock in the area. Also there \n\nis  the description of the actual setting of the ocean currents  and this is very \n\nimportant to understand the influence of the MOW that enter in the gulf and \n\nprocesses and interaction water-sediment.\n\nChapter 4 Materials. In this  chapter is  presented the characterization of the \n\ndifferent samples  set used in this  master project and the description of the cruises \n\nin which the samples were recovered . Not all samples  have been recovered with \n\nthe same sampling instruments  and also the data sets  are very different between \n\nthem, one is composed by chimneys  formation, one by carbonate concretions and \n\nthe other by carbonate crusts.\n\nChapter 5: Methods. Here are described all the methods used the analysis  done \n\non the samples such as  thin section technique, X-ray diffraction, and all the \n\nanalysis and the meaning of the variables  that has been measured or calculated \n\non the samples.\n\nChapter 6: Results. In this  chapter are showed all the results  of the analysis, \n\ncommented and linked together. All the data results have been analyzed and \n\nplotted with Microsoft Excel, R-Statistic and GCDkit extension for R.\n\nChapter 7: Discussion. In this chapter are discussed all the results showed in the \n\nprevious one. Trends  and anomalies  between the different groups and within \n\nindividuals will be investigated.. Then sample relationships  and trends linking the \n\ndifferent groups  and samples  in the different groups  with the variables  will be \n\n6\n\n\n\ndiscussed and analyzed.\n\nChapter 8: Conclusions. In this Chapter results and main conclusions are \n\npresented. the formation processes and their signature on the different types  of \n\nsamples  is  presented. It will discussed about if the carbonate in this thesis  really \n\nare MDAC and why, and the importance and significance of this  in general and \n\nespecially in the area of the Gulf of Cadiz.\n\n7\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Theoretical Background\n\n2.1 Carbonate Rocks\n\nSedimentary carbonates  are very important, they cover about 7% of the earth \n\nsurface and correspond to 10-15% of the total sedimentary rocks (Morse et al., \n\n1990). \n\nThe economic importance of this type of sedimentary rocks is  close related with \n\nthe hydrocarbons  industry. In fact more than 50% of the oil and gas reservoirs   are \n\nrelated with carbonate reservoirs. Because carbonate minerals  generally are \n\nsoluble in slightly acidic waters, they often have high porosity and permeability, \n\nmaking them ideal reservoirs for petroleum.\n\nAlso a large part of carbon on earth is stored in carbonate sediments and therefore \n\ncarbonates play a major role in the global carbon cycle (Lein, 2004).\n\ncarbonates are of interest not only to the oil industry they have also economic \n\nimportance as  industrial \"mineral\" resource to the agriculture, as natural stone, \n\nand to the cement and concrete composites  industry. Two main types  of carbonate \n\nrocks can be considered:\n\n-Limestones, composed mostly of calcite (CaCO3) or high Mg calcite [(Ca,Mg)\nCO3]; \n-Dolostones, composed mostly of dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2].\n\n2.1.1 Mineralogy\n\nCarbonate rocks contain a variety of minerals. Calcite and dolomite are the most \n\nabundant, aragonite is  rarer, and other carbonate minerals, such as  [ankerite, \u2026] \n\nare largely considered has result of special deposits and called \u201ctrace minerals\u201d.\n\nIs appropriate to divide carbonate minerals  by the environments in which they are \n\ndeposited, in fact the factors  controlling the source, mineralogy and diagenesis are \n\nvery different in deep, intermediate and shallow water.\n\nThe main characteristics  of those minerals  and will be discussed now and \n\nsubsequently the environmental differences between the different carbonates.\n\nCaCO3 minerals: Is possible to distinguish between three polymorphs of this \n\ncomposition. Calcite (rhombohedral mineral) is  the most abundant carbonate \n\n8\n\n\n\nmineral and is the most stable thermodynamically. Aragonite (orthorhombic \n\nmineral) is 1,5 times more soluble than calcite. Viterite, of hexagonal structure, has \n\nbeen rarely observed in natural systems  and always  in condition in which it is \n\nmetastable relative to calcite and aragonite. Viterite is  3,7 times more soluble than \n\ncalcite and 2,5 than aragonite (Morse et al., 1990).\n\nDolomite: is one of the most abundant sedimentary carbonate minerals. Its \n\nformation remains controversial because of the complex and well-ordered \n\nstructure and because of the many different types  of dolomites  that exist. There is \n\na deep relation of stability between dolomite and calcite, in fact in different \n\nenvironment the two minerals exchange in percentage of Ca and Mg to increase \n\ntheir stability. In marine waters mostly, but also in others, dolomite is the stable \n\ncarbonate phase.\n\nHigh temperature dolomite, it happen dolomization process. it is the process by \n\nwhich limestone is  altered into dolomite; when limestone comes into contact with \n\nmagnesium-rich water, the mineral dolomite, calcium and magnesium  carbonate, \n\nCaMg(CO3)2, replaces  the calcite in the rock, volume for volume. Dolomitization \n\ninvolves recrystallization on a large scale.\n\nLow temperature dolomite give problem in formation, in the water, and can be \n\nsubstitute by aragonite (Morse et al., 1990).\n\nOther carbonate phases: The carbonates tends to form  a variety of hydrates. \n\nMagnesite, for example, cannot form directly from liquid to solid in surface \n\ncondition, but a variety of magnesium carbonate hydrates form from solution. \n\nThe possible substitution in the carbonate mineral general structure between the \n\ncalcium  or magnesium  and iron or manganese produce a very large number of \n\nmineral compositions and structures (Morse et al., 1990). \n\n2.1.2 Classification of carbonate rocks\n\nThere are two main classifications that can be used to classify carbonates rocks.\n\nFolk Classification\n\nThe Folk classification divides  carbonates into two groups. Allochemical rocks  are \n\nthose that contain grains  brought in from elsewhere (i.e. similar to detrital grains in \n\n9\n\n\n\nclastic rocks). Allochemical rocks have grains  that may consist of fossiliferous \n\nmaterial, ooids, peloids, or intraclasts. These are embedded in a matrix consisting \n\nof microcrystalline carbonate (calcite or dolomite), called micrite when cement \n\ncrystals  are less than 5 microns, or larger visible crystals of carbonate, called \n\nsparite. Sparite is  clear granular carbonate that has formed through \n\nrecrystallization of micrite, or by crystallization within previously existing void \n\nspaces during diagenesis. Orthochemical rocks  are those in which the carbonate \n\ncrystallized in place (Morse et al., 1990).\n\nDunham Classification.\n\nThe Dunham  classification is based on the concept of grain support. Also this \n\nclassification divides carbonate rocks into two groups, those whose original \n\ncomponents were not bound together during deposition and those whose original \n\ncomponents formed in place and consist of intergrowths of skeletal material. The \n\nlatter groups  are also called boundstones. The former group is  further subdivided \n\nas  to whether or not the grains are mud-supported or grain supported. If the rock \n\nFigure 2: Folk classification of carbonates rocks. (Souce: Folk, 1965)\n\n10\n\n\n\nconsists of less  than 10% grains it is called a mudstone. If it is mud supported with \n\ngreater than 10% grains it is called a wackstone. If the rock is grain supported, it is \n\ncalled a packstone, if the grains  have shapes that allow for small amounts  of mud \n\nto occur in the interstices, and a grainstone if there is  no mud between the grains \n\n(Morse et al., 1990).\n\n2.1.3 Carbonate Precipitation\n\nCarbonate precipitation in the marine environment occurs by abiotic and biotic \n\nprocesses  and is  possible to estimate the degree of biotic influence on the \n\nprecipitation process using this three stages: \n\na) Abiotic precipitation is controlled by the thermodynamic saturation state and \n\nthe reaction kinetics of the aqueous  solution; the influence of organisms is \n\ninsignificant.\n\nb) Biologically induced precipitation or mineralization occurs as  a byproduct of \n\nan organism\u2019s metabolic activity or through its interactions  with the surrounding \n\nenvironment. The organism  is a causative agent only, without control over \n\nmineral type or habit, and therefore the minerals  resulting from this  precipitation \n\ndiffer little from their inorganic counterparts.\n\nc) Biologically controlled precipitation is a process where composition and form \n\nFigure 3: Dunham classification of carbonates rocks. (souce: Dunham, 1961)\n\n11\n\n\n\nof the mineral as  well as  onset and termination of precipitation are determined \n\nby organisms. The mineralization is  completely regulated, allowing the organism \n\nto precipitate minerals  that serve some physiological purpose. The organism \n\nuses cellular activities  to direct the nucleation, growth, morphology and final \n\nlocation of the mineral that is  deposited. All the biologically controlled \n\nmineralization processes  occur in an isolated environment, that can be \n\nextracellularly, intercellularly or intracellularly. \n\nOnly three modes of carbonate precipitation are significant: the skeletal mode of \n\nprecipitation (largely of the biotically controlled type), the microbial mode \n\n(predominantly biotically induced) and the abiotic mode (Tuker et al.,1990).\n\n2.1.4 Skeletal mode of biologically controlled precipitation\n\nThe majority of carbonate material in modern oceans  are  composed by skeletons \n\nof organisms. The formation and the deposition of these skeletons  are influenced \n\nby various  environmental factors, and function of the type of metabolism  employed \n\nin the formation of skeleton. Is possible to distinguish two main type of \n\nmetabolism: autotrophy and heterotrophy. Autotrophic organisms use inorganic \n\nmaterials  to synthesize organic matter useful to the organism. The heterotrophic \n\norganisms use organic material to synthesize the organic matter useful to the \n\norganism. Among the carbonate producers , autotrophic organisms are all photo-\n\nautotrophic: they perform photosynthesis  to live so they strongly depend on light \n\nand temperature to survive. Note that the metabolism  of extinct groups can only be \n\ndeduced from circumstantial evidence (Schlager W., 1992).\n\n2.1.5 Microbial mode of biogenic induced precipitation\n\nShallow water carbonates  into skeletal material and abiotic precipitates is \n\ninadequate.  A significant part of the non-skeletal carbonate material seems  to \n\nhave been precipitated under the influence of organisms  and so isn\u2019t possible to \n\nclassify them  as  abiotic. The precipitation is  predominantly induced by micro-\n\norganisms, mostly bacteria. Micrite is, usually, the dominant component of these \n\ndeposits. Often to refer to this  rock is  used the term \u201cautomicrite\u201d, it stands  for \n\nautochthonous  micrite as  opposed to allochthonous  micrite that was transported \n\nand deposited as  fine-grained sediment.  Microbial precipitates may form in the \n\n12\n\n\n\nphotic zone or below it, up to water depths of about 400 meters. On modern reefs, \n\nthe microbial deposits are best developed in the forereef zones (Schlager W., \n\n1992).\n\n2.1.6 Abiotic mode of precipitation\n\nIn this  category is included all the carbonate material that was precipitated from \n\nsea water during early diagenesis  within the depositional setting. Depositional \n\nsetting implies  that the pore waters  were very similar to sea water in composition. \n\nThe products of abiotic precipitation are found in close association with those of \n\nthe skeletal and the automicrite factory (Schlager W., 1992).\n\n2.1.7 Carbonate Depositional Environments\n\nThe major part of the modern, and probably most ancient, carbonates  are \n\npredominantly deposed shallow water depths (<10-20 m). This  occurs because the \n\norganisms involved into the carbonate deposition cycle, as explained before, are \n\nmostly photosynthetic. This  implies  that they need the sun light to survive and to \n\ngive origin to the reactions involved in carbonate formation. Furthermore, is \n\nimportant to consider also that the carbonate deposition generally occurs in \n\nenvironments where there is  a lack of siliciclastic input into the basin. This input \n\nincreases the turbidity of the water reducing the irradiance and the penetration of \n\nthe light. In addition, silicate minerals  are mechanically harder than the carbonate \n\nminerals and so may mechanically abrade the carbonates. High carbonate \n\ndeposition also requires  relatively warm waters  conditions that also increase the \n\nabundance of carbonate secreting organisms and decrease the solubility of \n\n13\n\nFigure 4: Carbonate depositional environments. (Schlager W., 1992)\n\n\n\ncalcium  carbonate in seawater. Nevertheless, carbonate rocks form, with the right \n\nconditions, also in deep water and in colder environments (Schlager W., 2002). \n\n2.1.7.1 Main carbonate depositional environments\n\nCarbonate Platforms and Shelves: Are warm shallow seas, generally in continental \n\nmargins  that are ideal places for carbonate deposition. Carbonate shelves  can \n\nalso occur surrounding oceanic islands after volcanism  has stopped and the island \n\nto eroded. Carbonate platforms  are buildups  of carbonate rocks  in the deeper \n\nparts  of the oceans on top of continental blocks left behind during extensional \n\nprocesses mostly (Schlager W., 1992). \n\nTidal Flats. Tidal flats  are areas that flood during high tides and are exposed \n\nduring low tides. Carbonate sands carried in by the tides  are cemented together by \n\ncarbonate secreting organisms, forming algal mats  and stromatolites  (Schlager W., \n\n1992).\n\nDeep Ocean. Carbonate deposition can also occur in the deep ocean, but only at \n\ndepths above the Carbonate Compensation Depth, by the accumulation of  pelagic \n\ncarbonate shells of  pelagic organisms  and of benthic organisms. The location of \n\nthe Carbonate Compensation Depth is  largely dependent on latitude - deeper near \n\nthe equator and shallower nearer the poles, but is  usually located between 3,000 \n\nand 5,000 m  water depth. The Carbonate Compensation Depth is the depth at \n\nwhich more than 80% of the initial sediment carbonate content, sinking from  the \n\nsurface, is dissolved. Whenever the seawater CO32- concentration is  higher than \n\nthe correspondent carbonate mineral saturation value, the carbonate mineral is \n\nstable and will not dissolve, but once water CO32- concentration becomes lower \n\nthan the correspondent mineral saturation curve the mineral starts  to dissolve. As \n\nthe carbonate saturation equilibrium increases with depth due to increase in \n\npressure (as dissolved calcium and carbonate ions  occupy less volume than as \n\ncombined in solid form).  The main type of carbonate deposition in the deep \n\noceans  consists  of the accumulation of the remains of planktonic foraminifera to \n\nform  a carbonate ooze. This ooze are buried and suffer a diagenetic \n\nrecrystallization to form  micritic limestones. Since most oceanic ridges  are at a \n\ndepth shallower than the Carbonate Compensation Depth, carbonate oozes  can \n\n14\n\n\n\naccumulate on the flanks  of the ridges  and can be buried as the oceanic crust \n\nmoves away from  the ridge, but also most oceanic crust and overlying sediment \n\nare eventually subducted so the preservation of such deep sea carbonates  in the \n\ngeologic record is rare (Schlager W., 2002).\n\nNon-marine Lakes. Carbonate deposition can occur in non-marine lakes  as a \n\nresult of evaporation, in this  case the carbonates are associated to other \n\nevaporites deposits. In this  kind of environment there is  a big consumption of CO2 \n\nby organisms, so the water become oversaturated with respect to calcite (Schlager \n\nW., 2002).\n\nHot Springs. When hot water saturated with calcium carbonate reaches  the \n\nsurface of the Earth at hot springs, the water evaporates  and cools  resulting in the \n\nprecipitation of calcite to form a type of limestone called travertine. \n\n(Schlager W., 2002)\n\n15\n\n\n\n2.2 Authigenic Carbonates\n\nThe term  \u201cauthigenic\u201d indicates  the in situ formation of a mineral. It comes from \n\ngreek and literally the meaning is \u201cborn in the same place\u201d. The minerals  that form \n\nthose rocks are characterized by the formation in place from  the interstitial pores. \n\nAuthigenic carbonates are, in general, formed by evaporitic deposition or by \n\nchemical precipitation of marine and non-marine water in loco.\n\nOceanic authigenic carbonates  are classified according to the origin of carbonate \n\ncarbon source, evaluated through several methods  of sedimentary petrography, \n\nmineralogy, isotope geochemistry, and microbiology. \n\nMg-calcite, proto-dolomite and aragonite predominate among the authigenic \n\ncarbonates. Their formation is  a biogeochemical (microbial) process that involves \n\ncarbon from ancient sedimentary rocks, abiogenic methane and bicarbonate-ion of \n\nhydrothermal fluids  into the modern carbon cycle. This  process is  a very important \n\nand powerful in the balance of the carbon  cycle, in fact it removes  annually about \n\n1 Gt of CaCO3 from  seawater (Lisitsyn, 1978). This process is  also very important \n\nand focus of intense study due to importance in the equilibrium of the CO2 balance \n\n16\n\nTable 1: Main regions of authigenic carbonate investigation. ( Lein, 2004)\n\n\n\nbetween lithosphere, ocean and atmosphere. It is  also important in the Ca balance \n\nregulation.\n\nThe time necessary for the formation of authigenic carbonates and the \n\nmechanisms of their formation were unknown for a long time. The first important \n\nstudy on authigenic carbonates  were made by Stakhov (1951) that studied the \n\nformation mechanisms  of diagenetic carbonates in Black Sea sediments. He \n\nbelieved that \u201cCO2 generated during diagenetic decay of buried organic matter \n\nwould play an important role in the migration and redistribution of carbonates \n\nfraction in sediments. Stakhov (1951) showed that the content of CO2 generated \n\nduring diagenesis, the amount of carbonate dissolved in pore solution, and the \n\nredistribution and concentration of carbonates in the form of local segregations \n\nhave a direct correlation with the organic matter content (Strakhov, 1962, p. 545). \n\nHowever, Strakhov denied the role of bacteria in calcium  precipitation. He believed \n\nthat \u201cbacterial calcite formation\u201d is  insignificant, whereas  chemical precipitation of \n\nCaCO3 and its transport in suspended form are a dominant process\u201d (Strakhov, \n\n17\n\nFigure 5: Schematic representation of the carbon species and carbon isotope compositions of dif-\nferent reservoirs involved in hydrothermal  systems at mid-ocean ridge environments. (a) Lost City-\ntype hydrothermal  system (b) Black smoker type  system. Abbreviations: DOC, dissolved organic \ncarbon; DIC, dissolved inorganic carbon; TOC, total  organic carbon; TIC, total inorganic carbon; \nTC, total carbon (Delacour et al., 2008)\n\n\n\n1962, p. 102).\n\nAfter the 1960s the interest about authigenic carbonate formation processes \n\nincrease with the discover of the methane-derived authigenic carbonates  (MDAC) \n\nthat are related to methane oxidation in the oceanic sediments (Niemann et.al, \n\n1984). In 1984 methane seeps were discovered.These seepage sites  correspond \n\nto the discharge of methane-bearing solutions  and gas  jets  from bottom \n\nsediments. These structures produced a new attention on the authigenic \n\ncarbonates (Suess et al., 1985). This  type of authigenic carbonates  is  marked by \n\nthe presence and development of unique biological communities  (Sibuet and Olu, \n\n1998) and by the large variability of their morphologies, including carbonate \n\nbuildups (\u201cchimneys\u201d or \u201creefs\u201d), plates, crusts, and so on (Lein, 2004).\n\nSince the 1970\u2019s  and 80\u2019s, a large number of active hydrothermal fields have been \n\ndiscovered, especially in the mid-ocean ridges. Those are characterized by the \n\ndischarge of endogenic gases, like CH4 and CO2, and by the formation of \n\nauthigenic carbonates  minerals, that depending from  the cases  can be formed \n\nstockworks or as chimneys and buildups  at hydrothermal vents  associated with \n\noff-axis and serpentinization vents  (Lein, 2004). An example of this last possibility \n\nis  the Lost City field, discovered in 2001. This is a hydrothermal field characterized \n\nby low-temperature fluids venting at the seafloor, that is also characterized by \n\nabout 30 columnar carbonate buildups, up to 10 m  across and 60 m  high. It was \n\nlocated at the intersection of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with a transform  fault in the \n\nNorth Atlantic 30\u00b0 N area (Kelley et al., 2001; Lein et al., 2002a). This vent system \n\nis  located in an off-axis  setting where serpentinization of lower oceanic crust and \n\nupper mantle peridotite produces  large amount of methane and hydrogen released \n\ninto the surrounding water; they do not produce significant amounts  of carbon \n\ndioxide, hydrogen sulfide or metals, which are the major outputs  of volcanic black \n\nsmoker vents, in figure 5 is possible to see at the differences between a typical \n\nblack smoker vent and the Lost City vent. All the methane and hydrogen rich fluid \n\nescape as volatiles sustain dense microbial communities, which include \n\nmethanogenic and/or methanotrophic Archaea, methane-oxidizing bacteria, and \n\nsulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Delacour et al., 2008).\n\nSince 1975, occurrences and processes of authigenic carbonate formation in \n\n18\n\n\n\nsediments  of the modern ocean had been investigated (see figure 6 and table 1). \n\nAs shown in table 1, the authigenic carbonates  are formed at different water \n\ndepths, from shallow settings with just a few meters  up to the deep ocean with \n\nwater depths  of more than 4500 m, and in different environments, from tropical \n\nzones to the polar-ones (Lein, 2004). \n\nTheir formation is a major process of interaction of organic and inorganic carbon \n\ncycles with the calcium cycleThe inorganic and the organic carbon cycles  are \n\nconnected by CO2 assimilation (photosynthesis  and chemosynthesis) and CO2 \n\nextraction. It means  that the Ca cycle governs via carbonates  formation acidic-\n\nalkaline and redox conditions of the biosphere, particularly in the ocean.\n\nEach type of carbonate described by Lein (2004) has  particular formation \n\nconditions and characteristics. \n\n\u2022 Lein (2004) Type I: decay of microbial organic matter in sediments\n\n19\n\nFigure 6: Location of the  studied regions with authigenic carbonates in the ocean. (1) Subduc-\ntion  zones; (2) spreading zones; (3) study regions; (1) Gulf of California; (2) Sea  of Okhotsk, \nParamushir Isl. area; (3) Black Sea, Dnepr canyon; (4) Norwegian Sea, Haakon Mosby mud \nvolcano (HMMV); (5) mud volcanoes of the Gulf of Cadiz; (6, 7) active hydrothermal fields of the \nMid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR): (6) Lost City (30\u00b0 N); (7) Logachev (14\u00b0 N). ( Lein, 2004)\n\n\n\nThe formation conditions  of the type I authigenic carbonates (Lein, 2004) \n\ninclude high content of labile Corg and enhanced heterotrophic microbial \n\nactivity in the sediments. In this type, the organic matter decays  in the \n\nsediments  resulting in the precipitation of carbonates, that are depleted in \n\nheavy carbon isotope 13C (up to 10-15per mil), relative to the normal marine \n\ncarbonates produced by the input of seawater CO2 that inherited the \n\nisotopic composition of the primary Corg. The !18O value in the carbonates \n\ndepends mainly on the oxygen isotopic composition of the bicarbonate ion \n\nin the pore water or seawater and less  on the water temperature. Mg-calcite \n\npredominates in carbonates of this type.\n\n\u2022 Lein (2004) Type II: Methane Derived Authigenic Carbonate (MDAC)\n\nType II is  formed as  result of the migration of methane, of various  origins, which \n\nhis oxidation under anaerobic conditions  induces  the formation of carbonates. This \n\ntype II corresponds  to the so-called methane-derived authigenic carbonates \n\n(MDAC) (Lein, 2004). All the samples studied in this thesis belong of this type.\n\nMethane seeps are related to specific tectonic and geomorphological processes  of \n\nlarger scale in the marine setting. Lein (2004) divide the formation processes of \n\nmethane seeps authigenic carbonate on the following types  and subtypes \n\naccording to the source of the seepage methane: (IIa) diagenetic methane seeps; \n\n(IIb) thermogenic methane seeps; (IIc) the same as  IIb, but with an assumed \n\ncontribution of hydrothermal methane to the fluid (in the Gulf of Cadiz some \n\nstudies suggest this case (Hensen et al., 2007; Scholz, F. et al., 2009) .\n\nThe methane seeps studied until now show that methane may be oxidized in both \n\naerobic and anaerobic conditions, but the microbial activity is  obligatory for \n\nmethane oxidation in both situations. The group of the so-called methanotrophs \n\nmicrobes participate in the aerobic oxidation.\n\nThe mechanism of anaerobic methane oxidation and the role of different \n\nphysiological groups  of anaerobic microorganisms  in this process  are actively \n\ndiscussed since the first publications by Zehnder and Brock (1979, 1980). Based \n\non laboratory experiments  with pure methanogene cultures  these authors \n\ndemonstrated that if substrates (CO2, H2) are exhausted and the methane content \n\n20\n\n\n\nis  high, methanogenes  start to perform  anaerobic methane oxidation, according to \n\nthe reaction:\n\n(1)                                    CH4 + 2H2O ! CO2 + 4H2\n\nSince this  process proceeds  very slowly in pure cultures  because of the hydrogen \n\naccumulation it is assumed (Reeburgh and Alperin, 1988; Valentine and \n\nReeburgh, 2000) that the reaction (1) occurs  in simultaneous  with the sulfate-\n\nreduction reaction (2):\n\n(2)                                        4H2 + SO 4 2-+ H+ ! HS -+ 4H2O\n\nIn natural anaerobic ecosystems this implies the involvement of sulfate-reducing \n\nbacteria (Reeburgh and Alperin, 1988; Valentine and Reeburgh, 2000). The formal \n\nsummation of Equations (1) and (2) results in the net mechanism  of sulfate-\n\ndependent methane oxidation (SDMO):\n\n(3)                              CH4 + SO 4 2- ! HCO3 - + HS - + H2O\n\nThe hypothesis of direct methane oxidation by sulfate-reducing bacteria has been \n\nalready proposed before (Barnes et al., 1976; Reebourgh, 1976; Reebourgh and \n\nHeggie, 1977). Microscopic study of bacterial mat samples  from the surface of \n\ncarbonate buildups  and inoculation on elective nutrient media revealed abundant \n\nand diverse microflora, including sulfate reducers, aerobic methanotrophs, and \n\nlarge filamentous microorganisms  morphologically similar to methanogenes \n\n(Pimenov et al., 1997). Results  of molecular-biological studies, which revealed \n\ntypical archaen bacterial biomarkers, also indicate the presence of methanogenes \n\nin these bacterial mats (Pimenov et al., 1997; Turova et al., 2002). \n\nLein (2004) used oxygen isotopes of authigenic carbonates  to describe the nature \n\nof ultimate electron acceptor involved in the anaerobic methane oxidation. The \n\n\"18O values  of carbonates  substantially differ from the \"18O values  of seawater \n\nand the sulfate dissolved therein, thus  eliminating their participation as  oxygen \n\ndonors in the anaerobic methane oxidation according to Equations (1) and (3).\n\nAccording to Valentine and Reeburgh (2000), such reactions proceed through \n\nmethane oxidation to acetate and water, equation 4.\n\n(4)     CH4+HCO3 -! CH3COO- + H2O\n\n resulting in the acetoclastic methanogens  activity, with the subsequent \n\n21\n\n\n\nparticipation of sulfate-reducing bacteria and anaerobic oxidation of acetate, \n\nresulting in the net Equation 5:\n\n(5)              CH3OO- + SO2-4 ! 2HCO3- + HS-\n\n(6)                               CH4 + SO2-4 ! 2HCO3- + HS- + H2O\n\nEquation 6, is  the sum of reactions  4 and 5, mediated by methanogenes and \n\nsulfate reducers, as similar to the SDMO reaction 3. However, the oxygen source \n\n(HCO3 -) and the intermediate oxidation product (CH3OO-) are substantially \n\ndifferent. Lein asserts that the contribution of marine bicarbonate with a rather \n\nheavy carbon isotopic composition (\"13C = \u20132.1\u2030 VPDB) may explain the above \n\nconsiderable difference in \"13C values  between carbonates and organic carbon of \n\nauthigenic carbonate buildups. The carbon isotopic composition of carbonate \n\nbuildups  is a mixture of isotopically light carbon formed during the methane \n\noxidation and isotopically heavy bicarbonate carbon of seawater. Thus, anaerobic \n\noxidation is mediated by a microbial consortium mainly including methanogene \n\narchae and sulfate reducers. According to the modern classification, a part of the \n\nsulfate reducers  belongs to archae rather than to the bacteria Phylogenetic \n\nDomain (Michaelis et al., 2002; Pimenov et al., 1998).\n\n\u2022 Lein (2004) Type III: Microbial oxidation of hydrothermal methane\n\nLein (2004) authigenic carbonate type III is  characterized by the discharging \n\nonto the bottom  surface as  any other methane undergoes the microbial \n\noxidation to form  carbonate crusts. Carbon isotope of authigenic carbonates \n\ninherited from the hydrothermal methane is a geochemical evidence of the \n\ncarbonate origin.\n\n\u2022 Lein (2004) Type IV: Mixing of hydrothermal fluid with seawater\n\nLein (2004) authigenic carbonates  of type IV are characterized by having \n\nseawater bicarbonate as the carbon and oxygen source for these \n\ncarbonates, whereas  calcium and partially strontium  are derived from \n\n22\n\n\n\nhydrothermal sources. Carbonates of this  recently discovered type are also \n\nrelated to microbial activity. A complicated microbial consortium \n\nimpregnates the carbonate buildups and maintains the reduced (Eh = \u2013120 \n\nmV) alkaline (pH = 9.0\u20139.9) environment in the hydrothermal fluid, which \n\npromotes the precipitation of carbonates. Microorganisms (more precisely, \n\nprokaryotes) with a specific calcite-forming function have not been found in \n\nnature up to date. However, it is  these microbial communities  that increase \n\nthe pH value of seawater and create favorable conditions  for calcium \n\ncarbonate precipitation.\n\nCarbon in authigenic carbonates of types  I and II is  depleted in the heavier isotope \n13C (!13C values  vary from \u201315 to \"50\u2030 (VPDB)). Unlike the carbonates  founs \n\nassociated with mud (volcanoes) that have positive !18O values varying from  1.0 \n\nto 5.4\u2030 (VPDB), the authigenic carbonates  of types  I and II are characterized by \n\nnegative !18O values ranging from  \u20135.1 to \"9.8\u2030 (VPDB). Microbial communities \n\noccur in all types  of authigenic carbonates considered by Lein (2004). Various \n\ncarbon sources  can be considered: Organic matter, methane, bicarbonate ion of \n\nseawater and/or pore water, and even inorganic carbon compounds of \n\nhydrothermal solutions. The authigenic carbonate formation is a combination of \n\nbiogeochemical (microbial) processes  that ensure the interaction of calcium, \n\norganic carbon, and inorganic carbon cycles. In conclusion, as proposed by Lein \n\n(2004),  the authigenic carbonates carbon sources  can be divided in four major \n\ntypes: (I) organic carbon of bottom  sediments; (II)  methane carbon, including (IIa) \n\ndiagenetic, (IIb) thermogenic, and (IIC) thermogenic + hydrothermal subtypes; (III) \n\nhydrothermal methane carbon; and (IV) carbon of # HCO3 - in seawater and \n\nhydrothermal fluids. Authigenic carbonates  of types  I and II are the most \n\nwidespread in the marine settings. All types of authigenic carbonates are formed \n\nwith an obligatory participation of microorganisms, among which many groups of \n\nsulfate reducers  and methanotrophs  (archea and bacteria) are most important. \n\nAccording to the first well-known model, microbial decay of organic matter in \n\nsediments  to HCO3 - results in an alkalinity increase due to H2S formation during \n\nsulfate reduction in the pore water. The participation of microbial processes in the \n\n23\n\n\n\ncarbonate formation under strongly anoxic conditions  is  controlled by the activity of \n\ndifferent microbial groups, which produce intermediate products of methane \n\noxidation. Bicarbonate of seawater and/or pore water participates  in the process \n\nas  a main oxygen source for carbonates. The third model is valid in the case of \n\ndischarge of low-temperature hydrothermal fluids with a high concentration of H2, \n\nwhich is a good substrate for the specific group of sulfate reducers stimulating the \n\nincrease in alkalinity of solutions and lead to the formation of carbonate buildups  at \n\nseepage sites. The whole variety of microorganism-mediated processes of the \n\nauthigenic carbonate formation in ocean is  not exhausted by these three models \n\n(Lein, 2004).\n\nAs results  of the processes described before, Mg-calcite (+ protodolomite), calcite, \n\nand aragonite dominate among the authigenic carbonates. Holocene buildups \n\n(younger than 10 ka) at methane seepage sites on the seafloor mainly consist of \n\nmono-mineral aragonite (Lein, 2004). Sediments  are commonly cemented by \n\nauthigenic Mg-calcite, also the carbonate nodules  are mainly composed of Mg-\n\ncalcite. Carbonate buildups  and nodules contain Sr and Ba. All authigenic \n\ncarbonates are depleted in the heavy carbon isotope 13C and in general enriched \n\nin the heavy oxygen isotope 18O. \n\nThe growth rate of carbonate buildups ranges  from  0.65 mm/yr to several \n\nmillimeters per day under anaerobic conditions and from  0.02 to 0.37 mm/yr at the \n\nboundary between aerobic and anaerobic environments (Lein, 2004).\n\n2.3 Fluid escape structures\n\n2.3.1 Cold Seepages\n\nIn this  thesis all the studied carbonate samples are from  or associated with the \n\ncold seepage processes and are methane derived as discussed and shown in the \n\nfallowing chapters. Submarine hydrocarbon seeps  are geologically driven \n\n\u201chotspots\u201d of increased biological activity on the seabed. A lot of sites of natural \n\nhydrocarbon seepage in the European margins  were investigated in detail during \n\nthe last years, including mud volcanoes  and pockmarks, particularly important are \n\n24\n\n\n\nthe Gulf of C\u00e1diz and the Mediterranean sea. Individual seeps  show ecosystem \n\nzonation related to the strength of the methane flux and distinct biogeochemical \n\nprocesses  in surface sediments. A common feature to the seeps is the formation of \n\nauthigenic carbonates. These, exhibit various  morphologies  ranging from large \n\npavements  and fragmented slabs to chimneys and mushroom-shaped mounds. \n\nThese carbonates  form hard substrates are colonized by benthic fauna. Gas \n\nhydrate dissociation could contribute to sustain seep chemosynthetic communities \n\nover several thousand years following large gas-release events.\n\nSince the first discovery of a hydrocarbon-associated cold seep community off \n\nLouisiana (Kennicut et al., 1985), hydrocarbon seepage and its close association \n\nwith \u201chotspots\u201d of increased biological activity have been documented at a number \n\nof seafloor sites worldwide (Judd and Hovland, 2007). Geological structures \n\nassociated with the expulsion of hydrocarbon-rich fluids, such as mud volcanoes \n\nand pockmarks, have been recognized all around the planet, the most famous \n\nexamples are the ones  on the margins  of the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean \n\nSea, and the Black Sea, and new seepage sites continue to be discovered \n\n(Foucher, 2009). \n\nThe phenomenon of gas seeps is  very important, is  frequently associated with the \n\ngrowth of distinct chemosynthetic communities (Sibuet et al., 1998) and with the \n\noccurrence of authigenic carbonate mineralization as a consequence of the \n\nmicrobially mediated oxidation of methane (Boetius  et al. 2000; Lein, 2004). \n\nSeveral of these features  can occur on the seafloor above petroleum reservoirs. \n\nExamples  of gas, and occasionally oil, leaking from reservoirs  include seeps from \n\nthe Gulf of Mexico (Sassen et al. 1993), the south-eastern Mediterranean \n\n(Coleman et al.,  2001), the North Sea (Judd et al. 1994) and in a lot of other areas \n\nin the planet. Even at depth, fluid escape from hydrocarbon fields is one of the \n\nmost frequent phenomena revealed by sub-surface investigation tools in \n\nhydrocarbon exploration and production (Mazzini et al., 2006).\n\nSeveral different types  of cold seeps can be distinguished, according to the depth, \n\nas  shallow cold seeps and deep cold seeps. According to Judd et al., 2007, the \n\ndifferent types of fluid escape structures that can be defined are as follows:\n\n\u2022 oil seeps: are sites where liquid or gaseous  hydrocarbons escape to the surface \n\n25\n\n\n\nor to the seafloor, through fractures and fissures  or through pore permeable \n\nsediments or sedimentary discontinuities. \n\n\u2022 gas seeps (usually methane seeps): are, like the oil seeps, sites in which gas, \n\nprincipally methane, escape to the surface through faults, fractures  or other high \n\npermeability geological structure.\n\n\u2022 gas hydrate seeps: A particular case of gas seeps  occur when the pressure and \n\ntemperature conditions  promote the formation of gas hydrates  and on these \n\nsituations  methane occurs  also in the form of gas  hydrates. Gas  hydrates  are \n\nice-like minerals  that form at low temperatures  (usually at about 2-4 C) and high \n\npressures  in the deep sea. Hydrates  contain gases, such as  hydrocarbons, that \n\nglue themselves  inside symmetrical cages  of water molecules to form  hydrate \n\ncrystals. Research submarines are the ideal tool to study hydrates under natural \n\nconditions. Gas hydrate is a water clathrate of natural gas. Thus, gas hydrate is \n\na naturally occurring solid comprised of water molecules  forming a rigid lattice of \n\ncages, where most cages contain molecules of natural gas, mainly methane. \n\nNatural gas hydrates are therefore a subgroup of the clathrates. The term \n\nhydrate is applied to clathrates  in which the structural molecules are water (H2O) \n\nand the guest spaces are occupied by gas molecules (Judd et al., 2007).\n\nThe term natural is used to indicate gas  hydrates that occur naturally on Earth, \n\nrather than being synthesized in laboratory or inadvertently created during \n\nindustrial transportation of petroleum gas. The term natural also indicates  that \n\nthe gas  that is  incorporated on the hydrate is  of natural origin, corresponds to \n\nnatural gas, which corresponds to all gases derived from  natural occurring \n\nchemical and biochemical processes. Natural gas hydrates  occur wherever \n\nconditions are suitable. As  water is  ubiquitous on Earth and, after water, the \n\nsecond more ubiquitous  compound in sediments is methane, the most \n\nwidespread natural gas hydrate on Earth are methane hydrates. Methane occurs \n\nin nature often accompanied by higher molecular weight hydrocarbon gases and \n\nby non-hydrocarbon gases. So, natural gas hydrates can also occur with other \n\nrelatively light molecular weight hydrocarbons  such as  C2H6, C3H8, C4H10, and \n\nnon-hydrocarbons such as CO2, N2 and H2S.\n\n\u2022 brine seeps (usually form  brine pools): Brine pools are sites  of brine fluids \n\n26\n\n\n\ndischarge into the  seafloor. These pools  are bodies of water that have salinity \n\nthree to five times greater than the surrounding seawater. The brine often \n\ncontains  high concentrations  of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic \n\nanimals that live near the pool. Deep sea brine pools  often coincide with cold \n\nseeps. Methane released by the seep is processed by bacteria, which have a \n\nsymbiotic relationship with seep mussels living at the edge of the pool (Judd et \n\nal., 2007).\n\n\u2022 pockmarks: Pockmarks  are crater-like structures in the seabed, formed by the \n\nexpulsion of gas  and/or water from sediments. These features occur world-wide, \n\nin the ocean at all depths (Judd et al., 2007).\n\n\u2022 mud volcanos: Mud volcanoes are sedimentary structures formed by the \n\nemission of argillaceous material, water, brine, gas and oil (Milkov 2000). Such \n\nfluid venting structures  occur in terrestrial and marine environments  worldwide \n\nand are caused by tectonic stress (Milkov 2000, Pinheiro et al., 2003). These \n\nprocesses  can lead to over-pressured pore fluids  that promote the upword \n\nmigration of over pressurized sediments  and, finally, their extrusion at the \n\nsurface or seabottom  with the emissions  of mud, water and gas that accumulate \n\nforming conical, volcanic edifices (Judd et al., 2007).\n\nVarious  examples of authigenic carbonates from modern marine cold seeps  have \n\nbeen described from  continental margins worldwide (e.g., Campbell et al., 2002). \n\nThey may or may not be associated with gas  hydrates. The samples used in this \n\nthesis are found in close association with mud volcanoes  and active and fossil cold \n\nseeps associated with faults (Luff et al., 2004; Judd et al., 2007).\n\nMicrobiological and geochemical studies  proved that in marine cold seep \n\nenvironments, methane and other hydrocarbon compounds contained in the \n\nascending fluids  are anaerobically oxidized to CO2 by a microbial consortium of \n\nsulfate-reducing bacteria and methanotrophic archea (Boetius  et al., 2000). \n\nAnaerobic oxidation of methane is the main microbial process  driving the \n\nprecipitation of authigenic carbonates  within subsurface anoxic sediments. This \n\nprocess explains  why the seafloor is often hardened by carbonate constructions at \n\nthe sites  of active methane seepage. The lateral and vertical extent of these \n\n27\n\n\n\nauthigenic carbonate constructions is  controlled by the balance between the \n\nintensity of the venting fluid flux and the ability of the microbial-archaea \n\nconsortiums  to oxidize methane and reduce the sulfate. However, the efficiency of \n\nthis  microbial-archaea consortiums can be counteracted by high methane flux, so \n\nthat methane can escape into the water column and may eventually reach the \n\natmosphere. Numerical modeling of carbonate crust formation has  shown that \n\nbioturbation and sedimentation rates  are also important factors  in controlling the \n\nflow of water and methane, and thus  carbonate precipitation at cold seep sites \n\n(Luff et al., 2004).\n\nThe authigenic carbonates  observed at the seafloor exhibit various  morphologies: \n\n(i) massive to porous crusts, centimeters  to meters  thick, that form  large \n\npavements  or fragmented slabs; (ii) circular chimneys, and (iii) irregular \n\nconcretions corresponding to cemented bioturbation casts. These hard substrates \n\nare often colonized by fixed organisms such as  tubeworms and molluscs (bivalves \n\nand gastropods), as  well as by abundant fauna (crustaceans, fishes) (Cunha, C. \n\n2009 \u2013 PhD Thesis).\n\nAuthigenic carbonates  can therefore provide a record of the history and evolution \n\nof cold seeps activity. Their mineralogy, geochemical and isotopic signatures \n\ndepend on the composition of the fluids  and thus  provide information on the origin \n\nof these fluids and their evolution through time. It is noteworthy that carbonate \n\nmineral associations are generally dominated by aragonite and Mg-calcite, \n\nalthough dolomite and ankerite may become the dominant carbonate phase (Aloisi \n\net al., 2000; Gontharet et al., 2007) as  in some types of authigenic carbonates \n\nsuch as  in the dolomite chimneys  of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz (Diaz-del-Rio et al., 2003; \n\nMagalh\u00e3es  et al., 2012). All cold-seep carbonates  are characterized by very \n\nnegative !13C values, as low as  -54.7 (VPDB), clearly indicating that they are \n\nmethane-derived products  (Kulm  et al., 1986; Hovland et al., 1988). Lipid \n\nbiomarkers  entrapped in the carbonate cements provide complementary \n\ninformation on the composition of the microbial communities  that were involved \n\nduring the formation processes, sowing evidences  of the presence of anaerobic \n\noxidation of methane, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis  (Bouloubassi et al., \n\n2006; Niemann et al., 2006).\n\n28\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Mud Volcanoes\n\nMud volcanoes  are a manifestation of natural fluid migration and extrusion at the \n\nEarth\u2019s surface. They are geologic structures  formed as  result of the emission of \n\nmud, water and gas, usually CH4, saturated to the surface or at the seafloor \n\n(Dimitrov, 2002). Often, included in the mud are rock clasts, ranging in size from  a \n\nfew millimeters  to 10 m or more. These clasts may be of various lithological types \n\nand are derived from the walls of the conduits through which the over-pressurized \n\nfluid mixture has  passed on its way to the surface. Mud volcanoes  are \n\nmorphologically diverse, ranging from  semi-symmetrical mound shapes  rising \n\nseveral hundred meters  above the adjacent countryside to regular and irregular \n\nconical shapes. Mud volcanoes vary in size from  small landforms of less than a \n\nmeter in diameter to large structures occupying more than 100 km2. Eruptions  at \n\nmud volcanoes  may be gentle or violent. In gentle eruptions, the mud volcanoes \n\nexpand by gradual and progressive outflows  of liquid mud. In violent eruptions, \n\n29\n\nFigure 7:  Map showing the global distribution of onshore and offshore oil seeps many of which \nalso emit natural gas. Numbers indicate the count of seeps in a given region. Redrawn and mo-\ndified from Wilson et al. (1973, 1974) (Kvenvolden et al, 2005).\n\n\n\nmud and mud breccia may shoot up in the air to heights  of a few kilometers. The \n\nemitted gas may ignite to produce spectacular flames. Mud volcanoes  are globally \n\ndistributed and occur in both the terrestrial and marine environments (figure 4). \n\nThe number of prominent individual mud volcanoes totals  1950 (Dimitrov, 2003), \n\nalthough the count is  continuously increasing as the knowledgement, especially on \n\nthe continental margins, increases. Mud volcanoes are irregularly clustered in \n\nbelts that generally coincide with areas  of active plate boundaries  and zones of \n\nyoung orogenic activity (Dimitrov, 2002). More than half of the total number of mud \n\nvolcanoes is located along the Alpine\u2013Himalayan Active Belt where there are \n\nabout 650 terrestrial and at least 470 offshore prominent examples. The largest \n\nand most active mud volcanoes can be found along this Belt (figure 7).\n\nInterest in mud volcanoes  has recently increased because, in part, their methane \n\n(a strong green house gas) emissions may have implications  for global climate \n\nchange. Dimitrov (2002) provides  a comprehensive review of mud volcano \n\noccurrence, plumbing systems, and possible geologic consequences. In addition, \n\nthere are recent reports of mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Mexico (MacDonald et al., \n\n2000), offshore Nigeria (Graue, 2000), South Caspian Sea (Voitov, 2001), \n\nSouthwest African continental margin (Ben-Avraham et al., 2002), northern \n\nApennines  of Italy (Capozzi and Picotti, 2002), Sicily (Etiope et al., 2002), western \n\nMediterranean Sea (Sautkin et al., 2003), Gulf of Cadiz (Pinheiro et al., 2003, \n\nSomoza et al., 2003; (Van Rensbergen et al., 2005; Van Rensbergen et al., 2005), \n\neastern Romania (Etiope et al., 2004), and East China Sea (Yin et al., 2003).\n\n2.3.3 Pockmarks\n\nPockmarks are concave, crater-like features on the seafloor, generally up to \n\nseveral hundreds of meters in diameter and tens  of meters  in relief (Kelley et al. \n\n1994). Mega pockmarks were also described and can have diameters  of more \n\nthan 1.5 km and depths exceeding 150 m (Pilcher et al, 2007). The formation of \n\npockmarks is  mostly caused by the seepage at the seafloor of thermogenic and \n\nbiogenic origin gases, mainly methane (Rogers et al. 2006) and by the release of \n\npore water . Pockmarks occur in lakes  (Pickrill et al, 1993), shallow bays, estuaries \n\nand fjords (e.g. Hovland et al.,  1988; Kelley et al. 1994; Plassen et al.,  2003, \n\nRogers  et al. 2006; Forwick et al., 2009), on continental shelves, slopes and rises, \n\n30\n\n\n\nas  well as in the deep sea (Piper et al. 1999; Paull et al. 2002; Loncke et al. 2004; \n\nGay et al. 2007; Forwick et al., 2009).\n\nThe lateral distribution of pockmarks  can be controlled by tectonic lineaments  (e.g. \n\nChand et al. 2008), underlying permeable bedrock and lithological boundaries \n\n( Paull et al. 2002; Forwick et al., 2009), as well as  buried channels  (Gay et al. \n\n2003; Pilcher et al., 2007; Forwick et al., 2009). However, they also occur near \n\nslope failures  (Hovland et al. 2002; Forwick et al., 2009) and in areas of rapid \n\ndeposition (Pilcher et al., 2007; Forwick et al., 2009). Pockmarks are furthermore \n\ndescribed from areas  that have been affected by the up-drift of ice that detached \n\nfrom the sub-seafloor (Paull et al. 1999), decomposing gas hydrates and where \n\ngas is  released due to melting permafrost (Long 1992). They can also be induced \n\n31\n\nFigure 8:  Illustration of a pockmark and underlying chimney during a phase of active expulsion \nof free gas. The passage of free gas through the hydrate stability zone is aided  by the formation \nof hydrate around the  pathways through which the gas is passing, inhibiting access of the gas to \nthe pore  water and preventing conversion of all  the gas to  hydrate. Progressive formation of \nhydrate and carbonate near the  seabed seals pathways, causing an outward migration of the \nactive gas vents. ( Foucher et al, 2009)\n\n\n\nby grounded moving icebergs  or anthropogenic activities  such as trawling and ship \n\nanchoring (Harrington 1985; Fader 1991; Forwick et al., 2009).\n\nAccording to Judd et al., 2007, pockmarks  are classified based on their \n\nmorphology in:\n\n\u2022 circular,\n\n\u2022 elliptical, \n\n\u2022asymmetric, \n\n\u2022composite .\n\nPickrill (1993) classified the pockmarks as  function on their state of development \n\nas:\n\n\u2022 new,\n\n\u2022growing, \n\n\u2022decaying \n\nAnother classification proposed by Pilcher et al., (2007) based on their lateral \n\ndistribution and formation mechanisms defines:\n\n\u2022fault- strike pockmarks, \n\n\u2022iceberg scour pockmarks, \n\n\u2022current-modified pockmarks.\n\nThe formation of pockmarks  can occur catastrophically in a very short period of \n\ntime (e.g. due to earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, melting of ground ice) or can be \n\nformed more continuously over longer periods  (Kelley et al. 1994; Hovland et al. \n\n2002; Forwick et al., 2009).\n\n2.4 Chemiosynthetic Fauna\n\nChemosynthesis  is the biological conversion of one or more carbon molecules \n\n(usually carbon dioxide or methane) and nutrients  into organic matter using the \n\noxidation of inorganic molecules (such as  hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide) or \n\nmethane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight, as  in photosynthesis \n\n(Foucher et al, 2009). Chemoautotrophs, organisms  that obtain carbon through \n\nchemosynthesis, are phylogenetically diverse, but groups that include conspicuous \n\nor biogeochemically important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing gamma and epsilon \n\nproteobacteria, the Aquificaeles, the Methanogenic archaea and the neutrophilic \n\niron-oxidizing bacteria (Foucher et al., 2009).\n\n32\n\n\n\nMany microorganisms  in dark regions of the oceans also use chemosynthesis  to \n\nproduce biomass from single carbon molecules. Two categories can be \n\ndistinguished. In the rare sites at which hydrogen molecules (H2) are available, the \n\nenergy available from  the reaction between CO2 and H2 (leading to production of \n\nmethane, CH4) can be large enough to drive the production of biomass. \n\nAlternatively, in most oceanic environments, energy for chemosynthesis  derives \n\nfrom reactions  in which substances such as hydrogen sulfide or ammonia are \n\noxidized. This may occur with or without the presence of oxygen.\n\nMany chemosynthetic microorganisms  are consumed by other organisms in the \n\nocean, and symbiotic associations  between chemosynthesizers  and respiring \n\n33\n\nFigure 9: Illustration of a pockmark and underlying chimney when only pore water is migrating \nthrough the  system. Methane from hydrate created during the free-gas expulsion phase keeps the \nmethane in solution in the migrating pore water at saturation concentration, supporting chemosynt-\nhetic biota in the pockmark, until  all  the hydrate is removed in solution. This process may continue \nfor thousands of years, with only moderate amounts of hydrate and  concentration  of methane in \nsolution in the pore water entering the chimney from below.(Foucher et. al, 2009) \n\n\n\nheterotrophs are quite common. Large populations  of animals  can be supported by \n\nchemosynthetic secondary production at hydrothermal vents, methane clathrates, \n\ncold seeps, and whale falls (Foucher et al., 2009).\n\nGiant tube worms  use bacteria in their trophosome to react hydrogen sulfide with \n\noxygen as a source of energy. Some reactions produce sulfur, such as:\n\nHydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis:\n\n CO2 + O2 + 4H2S ! CH2O + 4S + 3H2O\n\n(CH2O is used to mean carbohydrate, not formaldehyde.)\n\nInstead of releasing oxygen gas as in photosynthesis, solid globules  of sulfur are \n\nproduced (Kiel, 2010).\n\n2.4.1 Methane hydrate and chemosynthetic biota at cold seeps\n\nAt seeps  where methane is  escaping into the water column as free gas  it is \n\nevident that there is an abundant supply of subseabed methane for \n\nchemosynthetic biota (figure 8), but there are many seeps that support \n\nchemosynthetic biota where methane is  only in solution in the pore water that \n\nflows through the seep. Methane hydrate beneath the seabed plays an important \n\nrole where seeps lie within its stability field, generally in water depths greater than \n\n400 m. Hydrate provides  a metastable reservoir of methane, and it buffers  the \n\nconcentration of pore water methane in solution (figure 9).\n\nEstimates  of how long hydrate could provide a viable source of methane to \n\nchemosynthetic biota at the seabed under different conditions  were made using a \n\none-dimensional advection-diffusion model (Ivanov et al., 2007). The model \n\nassumes that, initially, hydrate lies 1 m beneath the seabed and the sulfate-\n\nmethane transition (SMT) is at 30-cm depth. Above the SMT, methane is not \n\npresent in the pore water, because it has  been anaerobically oxidized with \n\nmicrobial mediation, taking the oxygen from sulfate that has  diffused downward \n\nfrom the seawater to produce sulfide and bicarbonate (Boetius  et al., 2000). If the \n\nSMT is  much more than about 1-m  deep, methane in pore water is out of reach of \n\nmost of the biota living at or near the seabed.\n\nDepletion of a layer containing 12.5% hydrate by chemical diffusion alone will \n\n34\n\n\n\ncause the top to recede down- ward from  1m to 3m  depth below the seabed after \n\n1800 years  (figure 10). The SMT will deepen from 0.3 to 1 m  and the methane flux \n\nwill decrease from  2.1\u20130.7 mol m-2 yr-1. Consumption rates  of methane by in situ \n\nchemosynthetic biota vary greatly and are species  dependent (Torres et al., 2002; \n\nBoetius and Suess, 2004), but a rate of a few tenths  of a mol m-2 yr-1 appears  to \n\nbe sufficient for some species  (Niemann et al., 2006a). So, although the methane \n\nflux would still appear to be sufficiently high, the increasing depth of the SMT \n\nbelow 1 m would progressively reduce the viability of chemosynthetic biota.\n\nUpward advection of methane in solution in pore water can halt the downward \n\nmovement of the top of the hydrate and the SMT. For the model case, this  is \n\nproduced by a fluid flow rate of 35 mm  yr-1 with the concentration of methane \n\n35\n\nFig 10: Schematic representation of the control of methane concentration beneath the seabed by \nthe initial concentration  of methane in solution in upwardly migrating pore  water, the  presence of \nhydrate, and sulfate  in the seawater. The concentration of dissolved methane in  the rising pore \nwater controls the depth  at which hydrate begins to form. If it is less than the lowest value of met-\nhane solubility, then all  previously formed hydrate will  be removed, but the rate of removal de-\npends upon the  degree  to which the pore water is undersaturated and the rate  of pore-water flow. ( \nFoucher et. al, 2009)\n\n\n\nbuffered by the hydrate at 60 mol m-3. The concentration of methane in solution in \n\nthe pore water that enters the layer containing hydrate and the rate of flow of the \n\nwater control how quickly the hydrate is  removed. The layer would be diminished \n\nfrom beneath, where methane solubility is  higher and the rising pore water first \n\ncomes into contact with the hydrate. At one extreme, a 10-m-thick layer would be \n\nremoved in 160 years if the concentration of methane in solution was zero and the \n\nfluid flow rate was 1 m  yr-1. For a near-saturation methane concentration of 55 mol \n\nm-3 and a fluid flux of 35 mm yr-1, it would take 5500 years to reduce the thickness \n\nof the hydrate by one meter, while providing a methane flux of 2.1 mol m-2 yr-1 and \n\nmaintaining the top of the hydrate and SMT at their initial depths.\n\nIn short, if hydrate had been produced at shallow depth by an event releasing a \n\nhigh volume of free gas in the past, an accumulation of methane hydrate of low-to-\n\nmoderate concentration and a few meters thick near the seabed could sustain \n\ncommunities of chemosynthetic biota for periods of several thousands to a few \n\ntens  of thousands of years at seep sites  where methane concentration in pore \n\nwater is  high but not exceeding saturation. Such an event may have lasted only a \n\nfew years or less, depending on the efficiency with which hydrate was  formed from \n\nthe escaping free gas. Consequently, short-lived, catastrophic gas  venting at the \n\nbeginning of the Holocene or earlier could, without subsequent reactivation, have \n\nprovided the source of methane for active, present-day communities of \n\nchemosynthetic biota (Foucher et al., 2009)\n\n36\n\n\n\nChapter 3: The Gulf of Cadiz\n\n3.1 Study Area\n\nThe Gulf of C\u00e1diz is  located between 34\u00b0N and 37\u00b015'N and 6\u00b0W to 9\u00b045'W.  It is \n\nthe part of the Atlantic Ocean between Cape St. Vincent in Portugal and Cape \n\nTrafalgar at the western end of the Strait of Gibraltar.  It corresponds  to the \n\nsouthern Iberian and northern Moroccan margins at north and south, respectively. \n\nThe  Gibraltar Strait, at east, defines the connection to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe geological history of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz is closely related to the plate tectonic \n\ninteraction between Southern Eurasia and North Africa and is driven by two main \n\nmechanisms: (1) subduction associated with the westward emplacement of the \n\nGibraltar Arc, and (2) the formation of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz accretionary wedge, \n\nprobably not active at present (Maldonado et al., 1999).\n\nThe whole area is under compressive/transpressive deformation and events of \n\nmud volcanism  and processes associated with the escape of hydrocarbon-rich \n\nfluids were discovered. These fluid migration and escape structures  sustain a \n\nbroad diversity of chemosynthetic assemblages  (Cunha, 2007; Rodrigues, 2009). \n\nThis  extensive area encompasses more than 42 mud volcanoes, at depths  ranging \n\nfrom 200 to 4600 m  (confirmed by coring), and active methane seepage has  been \n\ndocumented on several locations (Pinheiro et al., 2003, Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2012).\n\n3.2 Geological Setting\n\nThe Gulf of Cadiz is located at the front of the Betic-Rifian Arc. It has  had a very \n\ncomplex geological history and undergone several episodes of extension, \n\ncompression and strike-slip motion (Maldonado et al., 1999). The westward \n\nmigration of the Gibraltar arc during the Late Miocene (5Myr) caused the formation \n\nof a fore-arc basin in the actual area of the Gulf of Cadiz (Maldonado et al., 1999). \n\nThe emplacement of the thrusting units, gravitational sliding of the mobile shale \n\nand salt stocks formed a giant deposit-mass, called Gibraltar Olistostrome, that \n\nmigrated west towards the Horseshoe and Seine abyssal plains (Maldonado et al., \n\n1999). This  olistostrome body consists  of a chaotic mixture of Triassic, \n\nCretaceous, Paleogene and Neogene sedimentary units, deposited on top of the \n\nPalaeozoic basement. These chaotic units involve a huge volume of Triassic mud \n\n37\n\n\n\nand salt salt units and under-compacted Early-Middle Miocene plastic marls \n\n(Maldonado et al. 1999).\n\nThroughout this area, pockmarks, extensive mud volcanism and mud diapirism, \n\ncarbonate mounds and fields  of high density chimneys, crusts and pavements \n\nrelated to hydrocarbon rich fluid venting are observed (Somoza et al., 2003; \n\nPinheiro et al., 2003; Ivanov et al. 2007). In the south Iberia margin it is  prominent \n\n38\n\nFigure 11: Tectonic map of the  Gulf of C\u00e1diz (Medialdea et al, 2009) showing  the main outcropping \nand very shallow diapirs, faults, mud volcanoes and mud-carbonate mounds. FSb: Subbetic Front; \n\nFF: Flysch Front. Mud volcanoes recently discovered after Somoza et al. (2008). B) Line-drawing \nderived from the MCS profile TASYO 1 that crosses the Gulf of C\u00e1diz.\n\n\n\nthe presence of a large NE-SW diapiric ridge, the Guadalquivir Diapiric Ridge \n\n(GDR) that runs  from  the shelf break up to 1200 m  water depth. This ridge is  very \n\nimportant in the oceanography and the sedimentary dynamics of this  margin \n\nbecause it controls  the orientation of the main channel of the MOW \n\n(Mediterranean Outflow Water) undercurrent that have an important control on the \n\nerosion, sediment transport and deposition along the northern margin of the Gulf \n\nof Cadiz. The GDR is  composed of a series  of wide sub-circular conical mounds \n\nsurrounded by ring-shaped seafloor depressions (Somoza et al., 2003; Diaz-del-\n\nRio, et al., 2003; Leon et al., 2007).\n\nIn the Gulf of C\u00e1diz area, the present-day convergence between the African and \n\nEurasian plates  is ~4 mm/y with a northwest\u2013southeast trend, and it is  being \n\naccommodated over a broad diffuse deformation zone (Stow et al, 2011). \n\nNevertheless, different periods  of crustal deformation, and plates  movements are \n\nknown to have controlled the evolution of this  part of the Iberian Peninsula. The \n\nrifting phases  that characterize the opening of the central and North Atlantic basin \n\nsince the late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous  had also constrained the deep \n\nstructure of the Gulf of Cadiz (Pinheiro et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 1996; Borges et \n\nal., 2001) and its later deformation during the Cenozoic, especially in the Miocene \n\n(Zittellini et al., 2009). Those are the most important phases and the ones that give \n\nto the Gulf of Cadiz his  present-day global configuration. The Gulf of C\u00e1diz \n\nCenozoic evolution was  controlled by the Alpine tectonic phases that affected the \n\nsouthern part of the European plate. Since the late Miocene, the northwest\u2013\n\nsoutheast compressional regime has  been developed simultaneously with the \n\nextensional collapse of the Betic-Rif orogenic front, by westward emplacement of a \n\ngiant \"olistostrome,\" the C\u00e1diz Allochthonous  Unit (CAU), and by very high rates  of \n\nbasin subsidence coupled with strong diapiric activity (Maldonado et al., 1999). At \n\nthe end of the Messinian, a transtensional regime caused the reopening of the \n\nconnection between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean through the Strait of \n\nGibraltar (Maldonado et al., 1999). By the end of the early Pliocene, subsidence \n\ndecreased and the margin evolved toward its  present shape (Maldonado et al., \n\n1999; Medialdea et al., 2004). The tectonics structure and evolution represented a \n\nkey long-term  factor in affecting the seafloor morphology, which has  then exerted a \n\n39\n\n\n\nstrong control on the pathways of MOW, on the geomorphology and sedimentary \n\narchitecture of the present-day Gulf of Cadiz. As  a result of the complex geological \n\nevolution, the bathymetry of the continental shelf, slope and rise of the Gulf of \n\nCadiz is  quite irregular and exhibits widely varying gradients resulting from  the \n\ninterference of several different geomorphologic processes  and structures. The \n\nshelf area can be divided into four morphological provinces; (a) the inner shelf, (b) \n\nthe smooth mid-shelf, (c) the south-east shelf with bedforms, and (d) the outer \n\nshelf (Nelson et al., 1999).\n\nThe shelf break occurs at about 130 and 20 m  water depth.  In the continental \n\nslope it is  possible to  differentiate into four morphologic provinces: (a) a narrow \n\nbelt between 130 and 400 m formed by the steeper (2\u20133\u00b0) upper slope, (b) two \n\n40\n\nFigure 12: Regional map of the contourite depositional system on the middle slope of the Gulf of\nC\u00e1diz and West Iberian margin with proposed site locations. Morphosedimentary sectors (1\u20135). \n(Hernandez-Molina et al., 2006)\n\n\n\ngently dipping (<1\u00b0) wide terraces  located between 400 and 700 m  water depth on \n\nboth the southeast and northwest sides  of the Gulf of Cadiz middle slope, (c) a \n\ncentral section between the terraces  in which several, steep (3\u201330\u00b0), narrow \n\ncurvilinear ridges  (3\u201310 km width) and valleys  (1\u20133 km  width) with general trends \n\nranging from NE\u2013SW to E\u2013W, and (d) a smooth lower slope from 900 to 1500 m \n\nthat is  more steeply dipping (2\u20134\u00b0) and incised by shallow valleys  in a NE\u2013SW \n\ndirection (Nelson et al., 1999).\n\n  \n\n3.3 Oceanographic setting\n\nThe present-day circulation pattern is  dominated by the exchange of water masses \n\nbetween the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of \n\nGibraltar (figure 13). This  exchange is  driven by the influx into the Atlantic of the \n\nMediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), highly saline and warm  water mass, that \n\nflows near the bottom; and by the superficial influx of Atlantic water into the \n\nMediterranean Sea, of less  saline and cool-water and generates  important \n\nsedimentary processes along the Atlantic margin (Serra et al., 2010a, 2010b).\n\nThe Mediterranean outflow as  it comes out of the Gibraltar Sill it flows as  a bottom \n\ncurrent due to is high density and due to the Coriolis  effect it turns  to the right, \n\nflowing as  a bottom  current along the northern margin of the upper slope of the \n\nGulf of Cadiz (Figure 13). In the Gulf of C\u00e1diz, MOW flows between 500 and 1400 \n\nmeters  below sea level (mbsl) (Cherubin et al., 2000). Its  distribution along the \n\nMargin is then conditioned by the complex morphology of the continental slope, in \n\nfact it generates two main sub currents, the upper-one, located between 500 and \n\n700 mbsl, is  called the Mediterranean upper water (MUW); and the lower-one, \n\nbetween 800 and 1400 mbsl, that is called Mediterranean lower water (MLW) \n\n(Boren\u00e4s  et al., 2002). In the western sectors, the interaction of these branches \n\nwith the seafloor generates big vortices, the so-called meddies, that are \n\nsubsurface masses  with anti-cyclonically rotation of warm salty water of the MO in \n\nthe Atlantic Ocean water .\n\nBetween ~500 and 1500 mbsl, the water column along the West Iberian margin is \n\ndominated by the warm, salty MOW and its two sub-currents. Below MOW at \n\n41\n\n\n\n~1600 mbsl on the north margin is  possible to find a water mass originated from \n\nthe Labrador Sea Water (LSW). Below 2000 mbsl, recirculated Northeast Atlantic \n\nDeep Water (NEADW) prevails, which represents a mixture of LSW, Iceland \n\nScotland Overflow Water (ISOW), Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW), and to \n\na lesser extent MOW and Lower Deep Water (LDW). Abyssal water in the region \n\nconsists of a lower fringe of NEADW, with an increasing composition of southern-\n\nsourced LDW with depth until ~4000 mbsl, where LDW dominates  (Stow et al., \n\n2011). \n\n3.4 Carbonate Chimneys\n\nDolomite chimneys  are interpreted as cemented conduits  formed as result of \n\n42\n\nFigure 13 : Location  sketch with main water-mass circulation along the margin \n(modfied from Hern\u00e1nder-Molina et al., 2006) (Stow et al., 2011)\n\n\n\nmethane-enriched fluid expulsion through the sediments. The abundant pseudo-\n\npyrite framboids  are related with the zone of shallow microbial sulphate reduction, \n\na process fundamental to the nourishment of the chemosynthetic cold seep \n\ncommunities. In the last years, it has been considered the importance of carbonate \n\ncementation related with methane fluxes, both on submarine modern \n\nenvironments and on rocks of the fossil record (Orpin 1997; Somoza et al. 2002; \n\nD\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003). Large fluxes  of methane seem  responsible for dolomite \n\ncementation, instead low and less  intense fluxes involve the cementation of high-\n\nMg calcite and aragonite. Recently, it has  been proposed that extensive anaerobic \n\nmicrobial communities exist in sedimentary layers  below(methane) vent fields \n\n(DeLong 2000). The sum  of the syntrophy cooperation between methane-oxidisers \n\n(archaeobacterias domain) and sulphate-reducers microorganism produces \n\ncarbonates and sulphides at the sulphate-methane interface, the depth below \n\nseafloor at this  reaction occurs  will  depend on the methane flux rate (DeLong \n\n2000). \n\nCarbonate dolomite chimneys  are found to be associated with hydrocarbon-rich \n\nfluid venting. They occur in several places  on continental margins, such as  in the \n\nCampos  Basin of the Bazilian Margin (Miller, 2006), in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, \n\neastern continental margin of India (Muralidhar et al., 2006); in the Otago \n\ncontinental slope, southern New Zealand (Orpin, 1997); Kuroshima Knoll, Ryukyu \n\nIslands, Japan, (Takeuchi et al., 2007); Denmark Margin (J\u00f8rgensen, 1989); and \n\nalso in the Gulf of Cadiz (D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003; Magalh\u00e3es, 2007; Magalh\u00e3es \n\net al., 2012). In the Gulf of Cadiz, dolomite chimneys were discovered in \n\nSeptember 2000 during the cruise Anastasya/2000 aboard of research vessel \n\nCornide de Saavedra dredging a 870 m-deep and 120 m-tall carbonate mound \n\ncalled as  the \"Iberico\". Here were collected more than 60 individual structures  of \n\nchimneys  with distinct pipe-like morphologies  that varies from  1 to 0.40 m long \n\n(D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003). \n\nThe chimneys are dominated by Fe-riched dolomite (ankerite) forming aggregates \n\nwith minor amounts of pyrite, iron oxide, Ta-enriched rutile, zircon and quartz. \n\nAbundant, well preserved remains of foraminifera (globigerinoids and milioids) \n\ncomposed of Mg-calcite are present within the matrix. Dolomite aggregates are \n\n43\n\n\n\ndepleted in 13C (-35 to -56\u2030  PDB) and are therefore interpreted being the result of \n\nmethane oxidation by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Aggregates  of single bacteria \n\nproduces rounded to pentagonal shaped framboids  of pyrite. Latter oxidation \n\nresulting from  the contact with the sea bottom seawater resulted in the \n\nreplacement of  the major part of these bacterial-origin framboids by haematite. At \n\nsame time, some of framboids  have been found in the interior of the foraminifers, \n\nwhich could suggest some symbiotic association between foraminifer and \n\nchemosyntectic bacteria (Somoza et al., 2002 and D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003).\n\n3.5 Carbonate Crusts\nThe authigenic carbonates can also precipitate in the form  of carbonate crusts or \n\npavements, that form   thin (cm size) crusts  up to massive crusts  with up to 50 cm \n\nthick crusts or even several meters high mounds, at the sediment surface or within \n\nsurface sediments. These carbonate crusts are built under a narrow range of \n\nphysical, chemical and biological conditions. They are indicators  of a relatively \n\nslow (20\u201390 cm  a!1) but pervasive (100\u2013500 years) upwards flow of methane-\n\ncharged (>50 mM CH4) fluids  (Pinheiro et al., 2003; Niemann et al., 2006). It is \n\ngenerally accepted that in the systems  wherethe authigenic carbonate crusts are \n\nformed, the dominant fraction of the rising methane is  anaerobically oxidized within \n\nthe sediment and sequestered as  carbonate, and as result only a very small \n\namount methane can escape to the seabottom water column (Kvendolven et al., \n\n2005). Carbonate crust formation has also the potential to affect the persistence \n\nand distribution of chemosynthesis-based benthic communities  at cold seeps. By \n\nstrongly inhibiting transport processes, the carbonate crusts  separate sulfate from \n\nmethane, decreasing the overall rates  of the anaerobic oxidation of methane and \n\nof the consequent production of sulfide. Because most of the chemosynthesis \n\nsupporting the development of macro-benthos  at cold vents is  based on the \n\noxidation of sulfide produced through the anaerobic oxidation of methane, the \n\npotential of these systems, where active carbonate crust formation occurs, to \n\nharbor such organisms is severely decreased (Pinheiro et al., 2003; Kvendolven et \n\nal., 2005; Niemann et al., 2006).\n\nThe carbonate crusts also act as a fluid migration barrier, inhibiting or blocking the \n\n44\n\n\n\nupward flow of fluids through the sediments. Thus, sedimentary carbonate crusts \n\nmay diverge and focus the fluid flow to adjacent areas not affected by crust \n\nformation. In the area of study, the Gulf of Cadiz, is possible to find two principal \n\ntypology of carbonate crusts:\n\nDolomite crusts. This  type of crust can be distinct from  the dolomite chimneys by \n\njust by the difference in the morphology . Dolomite crusts have planar shapes, up \n\nto 10 cm thick and up to 70 cm  across, they present no internal structure, low \n\nporosity, no macro-porosity or internal channels and neither shells nor biogenic \n\ncomponents (except for foraminifera and coccoliths) (Somoza et al., 2003; \n\nMagalh\u00e3es et al., 2007 and Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2012). \n\nAragonite crusts. In all the aragonite crusts  authigenic aragonite is  the dominant \n\nmineral with subordinate authigenic calcite and high-Mg calcite (Magalh\u00e3es  et al., \n\n2012), cementing a detrital fraction of quartz, feldspars, clays, mud volcano mud \n\nbreccia clasts, shell fragments, foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils. The \n\naragonite crusts  present a significant macro-porosity (voids, fractures, tubular and \n\nirregular cavities some of them interconnected) and high percentages of open \n\ninter-granular pore space, indicating formation within very weakly compacted \n\nsediments  (Somoza et al., 2003; Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2007 and Magalh\u00e3es et al., \n\n2012).\n\n3.6 Mud Volcanoes \n\nThe first discover and confirmation by ground-truthing of mud volcanoes  in the \n\nGulf of Cadiz was in 1999 during the TTR-9 cruise (Gardner, 2001). Since then, \n\nthis  area has been intensively investigated. Most of this  work was  carried out \n\nwithin the framework of the INGMAR (PLE/4/98), the Training Through Research \n\nprogram  (IOC/UNESCO), and the MVSEIS - Euromargins  (01-LEC-EMA24F http://\n\nwww2.geo.ua.pt/mvseis/Mud_volcanoes.htm) projects, all of them  leaded \n\n(MVSEIS) or with the active involvement of researchers from the University of \n\nAveiro. As  result, 46 mud volcanoes were discovered and confirmed by coring in \n\nthis  area during several cruises.(Extensive hydrocarbon-rich fluid venting and mud \n\ndiapirism were also observed throughout this  area (Ivanov et al., 2000;  D\u00edaz-del-\n\nR\u00edo et al., 2003; Pinheiro et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2003). These are related to \n\n45\n\n\n\nthe lateral compression from Africa\u2013Eurasia convergence, that promoted the fluid \n\nmigration, from deeper parts  of the basin, throughout faults, up to the seafloor. \n\nSeveral NE\u2013SW oriented diapiric mud ridges  have been found in the shallow NE \n\nsector of the Gulf of Cadiz. This area is characterized by abundant carbonate \n\nchimneys and crusts on top of these ridges (Gonzalez et al., 2009).\n\nMost of the mud volcanoes  in the eastern domain of the Gulf of C\u00e1diz are found \n\nlocated between 350\u20132000 m water depth, parallel to the NE\u2013SW and NW\u2013SE \n\nmain directions ,. Deeper mud volcanoes have also been recognized on the lower \n\nslope at 2300\u20134600 m depth (Madialdea et al., 2009, Magalh\u00e3es  et al., 2012). \n\nMost of those mud volcanoes  are clearly controlled by the so-called SWIM \n\nlineaments (Hensen et al., 2007; Scholz et al., 2009) (see figure 14). These SWIM \n\n46\n\nFigure 14: Map od the Mud Volcanoes descovered and confirmed in the Gulf of Cadiz until 2008. \n(Golnz\u00e1lez et al., 2009)\n\n\n\nlineaments correspond to the bathymetric expressions  of strike slip faults, that \n\nmost probably correspond to the reactivation of WNW-ESE pre-existing faults, and \n\nare segmented, of crustal-scale, extending from the Gorringe Bank to the Gibraltar \n\narea in the eastern Gulf of Cadiz (Zitellini et al., 2009; Magalh\u00e3es et., at 2009). \n\nZitellini et al. (2009) suggested that these faults mark a developing Eurasia-Africa \n\nplate boundary in the region. In particular, the lineaments  passing through the \n\nstudy area consist of a network of shear structures  that evokes the development of \n\nan incipient strike-slip fault system. These geological structures  are known to \n\nprovide fluid migration pathways (Moore and Vrolijk, 1992).\n\nGeographically, the mud volcanoes  are distributed in three main areas of the Gulf \n\nof C\u00e1diz. Most of them are found on the upper and middle slope between 350 and \n\n2000 m  water depth, either on the northern Iberian margin, where they are found \n\naligned along the regional compressive structures with a roughly NE-SW \n\norientation (Somoza et al., 2003; D\u00edaz-del-R\u00edo et al., 2003); or on the Moroccan \n\nmargin, following an approximately regionally dominant NW\u2013SE direction (Pinheiro \n\net al., 2003; Madialdea et al., 2009). \n\nSome of the most important and well-studied mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz \n\nare:\n\n\u2022 Bonjardim mud volcano: It appears  as  an approximately circular, isolated feature, \n\nwith a diameter of 1 km almost, it has  a height of approximately 100 m  with a \n\nseafloor depression at the rim of the cone.\n\n\u2022 Carlos  Ribeiro mud volcano: is located at a depth of 2200 m, with a height of \n\napproximately 80 m and a diameter of 1.5 km.\n\n\u2022 Olenin mud volcano: it appears as a dome-like structure, located on a slope.\n\n\u2022 Jesus Baraza mud volcano it has a circular feature . With a prominent high, \n\nmaximum height above seafloor of about 150 m.\n\n\u2022 Student mud volcano presents a sub-circular feature. \n\nThree new mud volcanoes: Michael Ivanov, Absu and Tiamat mud volcanoes  has \n\nbeen recently discovered during the RV Meteor M86/5 Cruise on march 2012. \n\nSome of the gravity cores recovered on the Michael Ivanov mud volcano are \n\nanalyzed in this thesis.\n\n47\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Materials\nThe samples studied in this Master thesis  project correspond to carbonates crusts \n\nand chimneys collected from 5 different areas  of Gulf of Cadiz (on small mounds \n\non the MOW channel in front of Gibraltar Strait, on the Vernadsky Ridge, on the \n\nPen Duick escarpment, on top of Mercator and Meknes  mud volcanoes, and on \n\nMichael Ivanov mud volcano) as illustrated in the Figure 15 and reported in table \n\n2. These samples  were collected during four different cruises: TTR 14; TTR 15; \n\nTTR 16 and M86/5.\n\n48\n\nFigure 15: Map showing the location of the samples used in  this Master thesis project (green \nstars).

The objectives  of this leg were twofold: to conduct detailed \n\ninvestigations  of geological and biological processes  on the continental margins of \n\nthe Gulf of Cadiz and to train students  in how to conduct research in marine \n\ngeoscience (Kenyon et al., 2006). Investigations were focused on mud volcanism, \n\n50\n\nFigure 16: Location of the samples collected during the TTR 14 Cruise that were used in this \nproject.

Gas  hydrates, carbonate \n\ncrust and nodules, as well as  benthic chemosynthetic communities  were sampled \n\nfrom some of these structures (UNESCO, 2006). Large carbonate chimneys, \n\nrelated to fluid escape were sampled and recorded by a deep-towed video system \n\non two small mounds on the main channel of the MOW in from of Gibraltar Strait \n\n( s e e f i g u r e 1 6 ) .

The main objectives  of the TTR-15 Leg 4 were \n\nto investigate the structural control of the fluid escape structures in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz and the associated fauna, in particular to investigate several mud volcanoes \n\nin the Moroccan sector of the Gulf of Cadiz, and investigate the possible \n\ncontinuation to the east and west of the southernmost known mud volcano field in \n\nthe NW Moroccan margin (UNESCO, 2007). Other main objective of this  cruise \n\nwas also the investigation, with geophysical methods  and coring, of several high \n\nbackscatter features  observed in the available side-scan sonar imagery in the \n\nFigure 17.

Some of these features have a \n\ncorresponding bathymetric expression and need testing to ascertain if they are \n\nmud volcanoes (Akhmetzhanov et al., 2007).\n\nA selected set of samples, representative of the different lithologies  collected in the \n\nstations 569Gr, 574D, 581Gr and 583G, as reported in table 2.\n\nCruise TTR 16\n The TTR 16 Leg 2, was part of the MVSEIS Euromargins Project, and was \n\nfocused on two main areas: (1) the E. Moroccan Field, and (2) the Deep \n\nPortuguese Mud Volcano field. The main objectives of this  cruise were: (1) To \n\ninvestigate the Pen Duick Escarpment to better understand this complex feature \n\nand associated ecosystems. (2) To re-visit the Yuma and Ginsburg mud volcanoes \n\nfor detailed studies. (3) To carry out detailed studies  in the deep Portuguese field \n\n(Akhmetzhanov et al., 2008). The TV controlled Grab TTR 16 \u2013 600Gr was \n\ncollected on the Pen Duick Escarpment and retrieved fragments of carbonate \n\ncrusts together with coral and shell debris. From  this  sampling station, a \n\nrepresentative authigenic carbonate sample was selected to this study (IV27).\n\n(UNESCO, 2008).\n\nCruise METEOR 86/5 \nMETEOR 86/5 cruise, done onboard the RV Meteor in February and March 2012, \n\nhad the objective of collect data from sites of fluid migration and escape to the \n\n53\n\nFigure 20: Onboard pictures of the samples collected  on  the stations 569Gr, 574D, and  581Gr, \nfrom which the representative samples IV23, IV24 and IV25, studied in this work, were  collected \nfrom.\n\nTTR-15 569Gr\n\n\n\nseafloor, located in the deep-sea region of the western Gulf of Cadiz and the \n\nadjacent abyssal plain.

The geochemical composition of the mud \n\nvolcano fluids indicates  that they are affected by oceanic crust alteration, and \n\nhence implies  that there is active flow connecting the oceanic basement and the \n\nseafloor. Such kind of hydrothermal circulation is only known for relatively young \n\noceanic crust (<60 Ma). Because of the fact that \u201cthe existence of a hydrological \n\nconnection between old, sedimented oceanic crust and the seafloor is a \n\nphenomenon, which essentially has not been investigated in the past, and may \n\nrepresent a (missing) link between hot vents  at mid-ocean ridges and cold seeps \n\nat continental margins\u201d this cruise had the objective of investigate sites along the \n\nwestward trending transform  faults (SWIM faults), mainly within the transition \n\nbetween the accretionary prism and the abyssal plain. As  the sediment cover \n\ngenerally decreases  to the west, the potential overprinting of the hydrothermal \n\nsignal of seep fluids  by sediment alteration processes is  expected to be reduced \n\n55\n\nFigure 22: Onboard  picture of the sample TTR 16 \u2013 600Gr collected on Pen Duick escarpment, \nfrom which a representative samples IV27 was collected from and studied in this work.\n\n\n\nlikewise (Hensen and scientific cruise party, cruise report, in prep., Magalh\u00e3es, \n\npers.Comm.;http://www.geomar.de/en/research/expeditionen/detail-view/exp//\n\n314699/).\n\nIn this  cruise had the participation of several researchers from the University of \n\nAveiro and sediment samples were collected and two samples were selected and \n\nstudied in the framework of this  Master thesis. Authigenic carbonate samples  IV20 \n\nand IV22 were collected from gravity cores: M86/5\u201324GC04 and M86/5\u201342GC10, \n\nrespectively (ifgure 24). These gravity cores  retrieved sequences of mud volcano \n\nmud breccia and hemipelagic sediments on the Michael Ivanov mud volcano. To \n\nbe noted that on this  mud volcano, another gravity core retrieved has  hydrates, \n\nindicating the present-day active state of this structure with methane rich-fluids  at \n\nthe seafloor or very close to it. \n\nSediments  from the top of the M.V. are formed by mud breccias, with clasts  up to 4 \n\ncm  in diameter (M86/5-24GC04), mainly of claystone but also including other \n\n56\n\nFigure 23: Location of the samples collected during the Meteor 86/5 Cruises on the Michael  Ivanov \nmud volcano and used in this project.

They present intense H2S smell, indicator of \n\nactive anaerobic methane oxidation. The present-day active state of this structure \n\nis  is also reinforced by the presence of a 10x4x6 cm size gas hydrate chunk \n\ncollected at shallow depth (65 to 76 cm  depth) in a gravity corer. The gas hydrate \n\nchunk has  a rounded shape, probably due to the melting of hydrate and \n\nsubsequent formation of ice surrounding the hydrate, during the long time between \n\nrecovery and sampling (Magalh\u00e3es, pers. comm.). Core M86/5-42GC10, \n\nrecovered at the northern crater of the mud volcano showed a sequence of silty \n\nclays and clays  and an intercalation of mud breccias  with very weak claystone \n\nclasts, partially dissolved into the matrix and several intervals  of high authigenic \n\ncarbonate content, with a carbonate concretion of 12 cm in diameter at 370-380 \n\ncm depth (sample IV22) that was studied in this Master project.\n\nThe samples  analyzed in this thesis coming from the four cruises described before \n\nincludes both carbonates crusts  and chimneys  coming from the different areas  of \n\ninterests of Gulf of Cadiz.\n\n57\n\nFigure 24: Gravity cores M86/5-24GC04 and M86/5-42GC10 andrespective core  logs from where \nthe samples IV20  and IV22 were collected from. Gravity core M86/5-100GC25, where a gas \nhydrate chunk was observed, is also shown.\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Methods\n\nFor this  work, were selected representative samples of the different lithologies \n\ncollected from: the small mounds  on the MOW channel in front of Gibraltar Strait, \n\nfrom the Vernadsky Ridge and the Pen Duick escarpment, and from  the Meknes, \n\nMercator and Michael Ivanov mud volcanoes. These samples were described \n\nmacroscopically and cutted along transversal and longitudinal sections. Thin \n\nsections of the representative lithologies  were prepared and their petrography \n\ndescribed. On the concretions  samples, the preparation of thin sections was  not \n\npossible to be done due to the low cohesion of the samples. \n\nPowdered sub-samples were then collected by hand micro-drill along radial and \n\nlongitudinal profiles on the transversal and longitudinal cuts  o fthe samples, and \n\nthe collected powdered was  used for the x-ray diffraction mineralogy, total organic \n\ncarbon, carbonate content, carbon and oxygen stable isotope analysis.\n\nAll the data obtained from the different analysis  have been interpreted and plots \n\nproduced using three different programs: Microsoft Excel, R statistics(see Annex I) \n\nand GCDkit (GeoChemical Data kit) (see Annex II) that runs on the R platform.\n\n5.1 Thin Sections\n\n5.1.1 What is a geological thin section?\n\nIn many areas of geological studies  such as  mineralogy, petrography and \n\nsedimentology  thin section preparation is the most adequate mean to  examine \n\nmicroscopically samples of sediments, soil or rock samples. This  analysis is \n\nnormally carried out using transmitted polarized light of thin sections  (of known \n\nand exact thickness) of the samples. Reflected light microscopy is also widely \n\nused for certain applications, in particular in the study of opaque minerals. This \n\ntechnique requires the surface of the sample to be flat and highly polished for the \n\nbest results to be achieved. The increasing use of electron microscopes is  also \n\ncontributing to the need for top quality thin sections of a wide range of materials.\n\n5.1.2 Thin Section Preparation Systems\n\nTraditionally, this time consuming and highly skilled process was  done by hand. \n\n58\n\n\n\nRecently developed automatized mechanic methods  have revolutionized the \n\nprocess by introducing technology that automates  and simplifies the preparation of \n\nthin sections - all with improved quality results, and have the following advantages:\n\n\u2022 consistently produces  high quality thin sections; \n\n\u2022 substantially increases thin section preparation output;\n\n\u2022 virtually eliminate the need for hand lapping &amp; polishing;\n\n\u2022 allows the production of thin sections of variable dimensions.\n\nDifferent types of thin sections and different protocols  and instruments to prepare \n\nthin sections are available. In this  work, standard rock thin sections not recovered \n\nby a glass  cover were produced. This  type of thin section allows the standard \n\ntransmitted-light petrographic observation, and allows  posterior analyses  of the \n\nsamples  by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cathodoluminscence \n\nmicroscopy and ion microprobe analyses.\n\n5.2 X-ray diffraction\n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) is  a versatile, non-destructive technique that reveals \n\ndetailed information about the chemical composition and crystallographic structure \n\nof natural and manufactured materials. On this master project, the bulk mineralogy \n\nand the relative abundance of different carbonate mineralogies  was  determined \n\nthrough X-ray diffraction (XRD) on 68 powdered sub-samples (table 3). X-ray \n\ndiffraction patterns were obtained at the Laborat\u00f3rio de Raios-X of the \n\nGeosciences Department, using a Scintag X-ray diffractometer with CuK! \n\nradiation (1.5405 \u00c5 wavelength). Scans  were done from 5\u00ba to 60\u00ba 2\" at 0.02\u00ba/sec, \n\nusing 40 kV accelerating voltage and 30 mA current. As  the intensity of the \n\ndiffraction pattern of a mineral in a mixture is proportional to its  concentration, \n\nestimates of the relative proportions of the minerals  in a sample were made by \n\nmeasuring their relative peak areas. Peak identification and minerals relative \n\nabundance estimation were performed using the MacDiff software package, as \n\ndescribed above. The peak areas were measured for the main peaks of the \n\n59\n\n\n\ncarbonate minerals  aragonite (3.40 \u00c5), calcite (&lt;8 mol% MgCO3, 3.036 to 3.012 \n\n\u00c5), high-Mg calcite (8 to 30 mol% MgCO3, 3.012 to 2.946 \u00c5), protodolomite (30 to \n\n40 mol% MgCO3, 2.946 to 2.916 \u00c5) and dolomite (40 to 55 mol% MgCO3, 2.916 \n\nto 2.871 \u00c5). The Mg:Ca ratio of the carbonate minerals  was  calculated from  the \n\nshift of the d-spacing of the (104) reflection peak of calcite and dolomite from the \n\nstechoimetric peaks positions in the diffraction spectra (Goldsmith and Graf, 1958; \n\nLumsden, 1979).\n\n5.2.1 X-ray Generation and Properties\n\nX-rays  are electromagnetic radiation with typical photon energies  in the range of \n\n100 eV - 100 keV. For diffraction applications, only short wavelength x-rays  (hard \n\nx-rays) in the range of a few angstroms  to 0.1 angstrom  (1 keV - 120 keV) are \n\nused. Because the wavelength of x-rays is comparable to the size of atoms, they \n\nare ideally suited for probing the structural arrangement of atoms and molecules in \n\na wide range of materials. The energetic x-rays can penetrate deep into the \n\nmaterials and provide information about the bulk structure.\n\nX-rays  are produced by either x-ray tubes  or synchrotron radiation. In a x-ray tube, \n\nsource used in x-ray diffraction instruments, x-rays are generated when a focused \n\nelectron beam, accelerated across a high voltage field, bombards  a stationary or a \n\nrotating solid target. As  electrons collide with atoms in the target and slow down, a \n\ncontinuous spectrum of x-rays  are emitted, which are termed Bremsstrahlung \n\nradiation. The high energy electrons  also eject inner shell electrons in atoms \n\nthrough the ionization process. When a free electron fills the shell, an x-ray photon \n\nwith energy characteristic of the target material is  emitted. Common targets  used \n\nin x-ray tubes include Cu and Mo. In recent years  synchrotron facilities  have \n\nbecome widely used as preferred sources  for x-ray diffraction measurements. \n\nSynchrotron radiation is  emitted by electrons  or positrons  traveling at near light \n\nspeed in a circular storage ring (Youli Li, 2002). \n\n5.2.2 Lattice Planes and Bragg's Law\n\nWhen x-ray photons  collide with electrons in atoms, some photons  from the \n\nincident beam  will be deflected away from  the direction where they originally \n\n60\n\n\n\ntravel. If the wavelength of these scattered x-rays do not change in energy level, \n\nthe process is called elastic scattering (Thompson Scattering) in that only \n\nmomentum has been transferred in the scattering process. These are the x-rays \n\nthat we measure in diffraction experiments, as the scattered x-rays  carry \n\ninformation about the electron distribution in materials. On the other hand, in the \n\ninelastic scattering process  (Compton Scattering), x-rays  transfer some of their \n\nenergy to the electrons  and the scattered x-rays  will have a different wavelength \n\nthan the incident x-rays. Diffracted waves from  different atoms can interfere with \n\neach other and the resultant intensity distribution is  strongly modulated by this \n\ninteraction. If the atoms  are arranged in crystals, the diffracted waves will consist \n\nof sharp interference maxima (peaks) with the same symmetry as  in the \n\ndistribution of atoms. Measuring the diffraction pattern therefore allows  us to \n\ndeduce the distribution of atoms in a material.\n\nThe peaks in a x-ray diffraction pattern are directly related to the atomic \n\ndistancesFor a given set of lattice planes  with an inter-plane distance of d, the \n\ncondition for a diffraction (peak) to occur can be simply written as 2 d sin ! = n \" \n\nwhich is  known as  the Bragg's  law. In the equation,l is  the wavelength of the x-ray, \n\n! the scattering angle, and \" an integer representing the order of the diffraction \npeak. The Bragg's  Law is  one of most important laws used for interpreting x-ray \n\ndiffraction data.\n\nIt is important to point out that although we have used atoms  as  scattering points \n\nin this example, Bragg's Law applies to scattering centers consisting of any \n\nperiodic distribution of electron density. \n\n5.2.3 Powder Diffraction\n\nPowder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) is perhaps the most widely used x-ray diffraction \n\ntechnique for characterizing materials. The sample is usually in a powdery form, \n\nconsisting of fine grains  of the crystalline material to be studied. The technique is \n\nused also widely for studying particles  in liquid suspensions or polycrystalline \n\nsolids  (bulk or thin film  materials). The term 'powder' really means  that the \n\ncrystalline domains  are randomly oriented in the sample. The positions  and the \n\n61\n\n\n\nintensities of the peaks are used for identifying the underlying structure (or phase) \n\nof the material. Powder diffraction data can be collected using either transmission \n\nor reflection geometry. The peak positions, intensities, widths  and shapes all \n\nprovide important information about the structure of the material.\n\n5.2.4 X-ray Crystallography\n\nIn particular in this thesis  is used the X-ray crystallography that is  a standard \n\ntechnique for solving crystal structures. In recent years, the advent of synchrotron \n\nradiation sources, area detector based data collection instruments, and high speed \n\ncomputers has dramatically enhanced the efficiency of crystallographic structural \n\ndetermination. In x-ray crystallography, integrated intensities  of the diffraction \n\npeaks are used to reconstruct the electron density map within the unit cell in the \n\ncrystal. To achieve high accuracy in the reconstruction, which is  done by Fourier \n\ntransforming the diffraction intensities with appropriate phase assignment, a high \n\ndegree of completeness as well as redundancy in diffraction data is  necessary, \n\nmeaning that all possible reflections  are measured multiple times to reduce \n\nsystematic and statistical error (Youli Li, 2002).\n\n5.2.5 MacDiff 4.2.6\nIn this  work, the diffractograms  obtained for each sample have been interpreted \n\nusing the MacDiff 4.2.6 interpretation software. It is  a program  for the analysis and \n\ndisplay of X-ray powder diffractograms running on Apple Macintosh platforms. It \n\noffers  conventional XRD profile-correction processes  (e.g. outliers, smoothing, \n\ndivergence, alpha2-stripping) and supports  qualitative and quantitative mineral \n\ncomposition.  MacDiff also supports methods  of  peak fits and peak decomposition  \n\nof coinciding lines. The user has at his  disposal the capability of continuous \n\nmeasurement checks and the possibility to perform corrections as well (e.g. by \n\nmanual or computed back- ground adaptations). For peak indication the user has \n\nthe option to employ variable peak data sets. High resolution hardcopies of the \n\ndiffractograms  can be produced. Data and plots can be exported to most of the \n\navailable table-processing or vector-graphics programs. The applications of \n\nMacDiff range from  routine analysis in sedimentology, especially clay minerals, \n\nover analysis of X-ray diffractograms of all types of rocks  and minerals  all the way \n\n62\n\n\n\nto phase analysis of various crystalline substances.\n\nMacDiff is a freeware software and is available together with the most minerals \n\nPDF databases, free of charge. It may be copied and distributed without \n\nrestrictions  for non-profit and non-commercial use. (http://www.geol-pal.uni-\n\nfrankfurt.de/Staff/Homepages/Petschick/PDFs/MacDiff%20Manual%20E.pdf).\n\nIn this  Master project, MacDiff was  employed for the analysis  of all the 60 \n\ndifractograms on a Apple Macintosh platforms.\n\nInterpretation steps\n\nTo have a correct interpretation of the difractograms, in this  work, I followed the \n\nsequence of processing and interpretation steps as described below.\n\nAfter opening the file (on the top menu File--->Open) the raw diffraction profile was \n\nsmoothed, using the smooth counts function. It cleans the difractograms from the \n\nhigh frequency instrument noise and produces  clear and well defined the peaks. \n\nThen I computed the baseline through the show baseline command, it will \n\ncalculates the baseline of the diffractogram that define the base of the peaks for \n\n63\n\nFigure 25: MacDiff 4.0.4 screenshot. Example of visualization.\n\n\n\nfurther area calculations.\n\nAfter this step, I corrected the peaks position using has standard the Quartz, syn \n\nd=3.343. To do this, we plot the quartz profile using the Quartz (syn d=3.343) peak \n\nthat naturally occurs in all the analyzed samples, as a standard. For this  step, we \n\nhave to search on the minerals  database the quartz mineral record and plotted his \n\nprofile on the diffractogram using the Draw command. Then identifying and \n\nselecting the diffractograms main peak of Quartz, we use the function \u201cpeak \n\ncorrection\u201d in the menu Profile, it opens a selection windows  with the different \n\noptions  of correction, where we select \u201cquartz, d=3.343\u201d peak correction. The \n\nprogram, based on the standard data selected, shift the entire diffractogram in \n\norder to adjust the selected quartz peak with his theoretical position. After his  step, \n\nwe start with the interpretation of all the main peaks present, sequentially following \n\ntheir relative intensity importance. When all of the main peaks have been \n\ninterpreted and all the minerals identified, we saved the interpreted file as  new \n\nfile.rd and saved the interpretation and quantification report. This report stores  all \n\nthe relevant information: mineral phase, main peak position, peak area, peak \n\nintensity and width at half of the high of the peak. This  data was then imported into \n\na spreadsheet table and used to calculate the relative abundance of the different \n\nminerals, the magnesium content on calcite, Mg-calcite, protodolomite and \n\ndolomite minerals, as will be showed later.\n\n5.3 Geochemistry\n\n5.3.1 LECO C, O, N and S elemental analysis\nThe carbonate and the organic carbon were determined using a LECO CHNS-932 \n\nelemental analyzer. Three replicates  of powdered and homogenized bulk material \n\n(2 mg), collected with a micro-drill, were analyzed per sub-sample. The same set \n\nof sub-samples was  later subjected to combustion for 8 h through a predefined \n\nstepwise increase in temperature up to 400\u00baC, to remove organic carbon, and re-\n\nanalyzed for inorganic carbon. The organic carbon content (Corg) was determined \n\nby the difference between total carbon and the inorganic carbon concentration. \n\nResults are presented in weight percent (wt%). The relative precision of repeated \n\nmeasurements of both samples and standards was 0.03 wt%.\n\n64\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes\nThe study of the isotopes  of carbon (13C/12C) and oxygen (18O/16O) permit to have \n\nimportant informations  about the paleoenvironmental conditions of the formation of \n\nthe rocks. It can give information about the temperature, the conditions of \n\nformation and the different origins  of the chemicals and elements  that are being \n\nprecipitated and form the rocks. Based on those informations  and on the results of \n\nthe isotopic ratios, it is possible to classify the different carbonates  components \n\nand to correlate the different carbonate minerals with their formation conditions. \n\nThe variations in the ratio of the isotopes, 18O/16O e 13C/12C, are calculated using \n\nan high precision mass spectrometer. The results are reported in the conventional \n\n! \u2030  notation with reference to VPDB (Vienna Peedee Belemnite).The ! value is \n\ndefined as  the per mil proportion of the isotopic ratio measurement of a sample \n\nover the isotopic ratio of a standard sample, according to the equation: \n\nA decrease of the ! values of the samples corresponds to an increase in the \n\namount of light isotopes  (16 O and 12C) in relation to the standard. Otherwise an \n\nincrease of the ! values of the samples means an increase in heavy isotopes (18O \n\nand 13C) in respect to the standard (Hudson 1977; Anderson &amp;Arthur 1983; \n\nMarshall 1992; Corfield 1995, Fairchild et al. 1988). For example, a !18O value of \n\n+15\u2030 indicates that the sample is enriched in 18O by 15 parts  per thousand \n\nrelative to the standard.\n\nThe !18O of a water carbonic precipitate depends  from  the composition of the \n\ncarbonate and on the temperature of formation. Usually, negative !18O values  are \n\nassociated with precipitation from low salinity fluids and with formation \n\ntemperatures (Hudson 1977). \n\nThe composition of !13C of carbonate precipitates reflect the different sources of \n\nbicarbonate dissolved in the water. These sources can include: sea water (!13C \n\n65\n\n\n\naround 0 \u2030), dissolution of carbonate skeletons (!13C around 0 \u2030), alteration and \n\ndissolution processes  of the soil (!13C around -10 \u2030), bacteria oxidation and \n\nsulfate reduction in organic matter (!13C around -25 \u2030), bacteria methanogenic \n\nfermentation (!13C around +15 \u2030), methane oxidation (!13C between -50 and -80 \n\n\u2030), and abiotic reactions  associated with thermic fracturation and \n\ndecarbossilization (!13C between -10 and -25 \u2030) (Hudson, 1977; Irwin et al.,1977; \n\nColeman, 1993; Mozley &amp; Buns, 1993).\n\nTherefore, carbonates that precipitates in isotopic equilibrium  (or almost in \n\nequilibrium) with their formation fluids   show  characteristic 18O and 13C \n\ncompositions that reflect, in a reasonable way, their formation environment. \n\nHowever for skeleton types of carbonates  there are two potential problems  that \n\nhave to be considered present: the vital effects and the possibility of a state of \n\nisotopic disequilibrium in the precipitation (Hudson 1977; Swart 1983).\n\nIn this  work, Carbon and Oxygen isotopic composition of the samples  were \n\nmeasured on the same powdered sub-samples  that were used for XRD and LECO \n\nanalysis. The samples were analyzed at the MARUM Centre of the University of \n\nBremen, in Germany. Samples for carbon and oxygen stable isotopic analyses \n\nwere prepared by reacting at 90\u00b0C with 100% phosphoric acid on an automated \n\ncarbonate device connected to a VG-PRISM mass  spectrometer calibrated with \n\nNBS19, NBS 18 and NBS 20. The results  are reported in the conventional ! \u2030-\n\nnotation with reference to VPDB (Vienna Peedee Belemnite). Analytical \n\nreproducibility of the method, based on repeated standards  is  better than \u00b10.1\u2030 \n\nfor both carbon and oxygen. For temperature calculations of the dolomite samples, \n\ndolomite !18O values were corrected for the analytical offset of +1.63\u2030, \n\nconsequence of the unequal oxygen fractionation during the reaction to CO2 \n\n(Rosenbaum and Sheppard, 1986).\n\n5.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\n\nThe scanning electron microscope (SEM) uses  a focused beam  of high-energy \n\nelectrons  to generate a variety of signals  at the surface of solid specimens. The \n\nsignals that derive from electron-sample interactions  reveal information about the \n\n66\n\n\n\nsample including external morphology (texture), chemical composition, and \n\ncrystalline structure and orientation of materials  making up the sample. In most \n\napplications, data are collected over a selected area of the surface of the sample, \n\nand a 2-dimensional image is generated that displays  spatial variations  in these \n\nproperties. Areas ranging from  approximately 1 cm to 5 microns in width can be \n\nimaged in a scanning mode using conventional SEM techniques  (magnification \n\nranging from  20X to approximately 30,000X, spatial resolution of 50 to 100 nm). \n\nThe SEM is  also capable of performing analyses of selected point locations  on the \n\nsample; this  approach is especially useful in qualitatively or semi-quantitatively \n\ndetermining chemical compositions, crystalline structure, and crystal orientations.\n\n5.4.1 Fundamental Principles of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\n\nAccelerated electrons  in an SEM carry significant amounts of kinetic energy, and \n\nthis  energy is  dissipated as  a variety of signals  produced by electron-sample \n\ninteractions when the incident electrons  are decelerated in the solid sample. \n\nThese signals include secondary electrons  (that produce SEM images), \n\nbackscattered electrons  (BSE), diffracted backscattered electrons (EBSD that are \n\nused to determine crystal structures and orientations  of minerals), photons \n\n(characteristic X-rays that are used for elemental analysis  and continuum X-rays), \n\nvisible light (cathodoluminescence or CL), and heat. Secondary electrons  and \n\nbackscattered electrons  are commonly used for imaging samples: secondary \n\nelectrons  are most valuable for showing morphology and topography on samples \n\nand backscattered electrons  are most valuable for illustrating contrasts  in \n\ncomposition in multiphase samples (i.e. for rapid phase discrimination). X-ray \n\ngeneration is produced by inelastic collisions  of the incident electrons  with \n\nelectrons  in discrete ortitals  (shells) of atoms  in the sample. As the excited \n\nelectrons  return to lower energy states, they yield X-rays that are of a fixed \n\nwavelength (that is  related to the difference in energy levels  of electrons  in \n\ndifferent shells for a given element). Thus, characteristic X-rays are produced for \n\neach element in a mineral that is  \"excited\" by the electron beam. SEM analysis is \n\nconsidered to be \"non-destructive\"; that is, x-rays generated by electron \n\ninteractions do not lead to volume loss  of the sample, so it is  possible to analyze \n\n67\n\n\n\nthe same materials repeatedly.\n\n5.4.2 Applications\n\nThe SEM is routinely used to generate high-resolution images  of shapes of objects \n\n(SEI) and to show spatial variations in chemical compositions: \n\n1. acquiring elemental maps or spot chemical analyses using EDS,\n\n2. discrimination of phases based on mean atomic number (commonly related to \n\nrelative density) using BSE,\n\n3. compositional maps based on differences  in trace element \"activitors\" using \n\nCL. \n\nThe SEM is  also widely used to identify phases  based on qualitative chemical \n\nanalysis and/or crystalline structure. Precise measurement of very small features \n\nand objects  down to 50 nm in size is also accomplished using the SEM. \n\nBackescattered electron images (BSE) can be used for rapid discrimination of \n\nphases  in multiphase samples. SEMs equipped with diffracted backscattered \n\nelectron detectors  (EBSD) can be used to examine microfabric and \n\ncrystallographic orientation in many materials.\n\nIn our case the SEM analysis should be performed on the thin sections.\n\n68\n\n\n\nChapter 6: Results\n\n6.1 Samples description\n\nBased on the morphology, the macroscopic characteristics  and the mineralogy, the \n\nfollowing three different types  of authigenic carbonates have been defined for the \n\nstudied samples from the Gulf of Cadiz: chimneys, crusts and concretions.\n\n6.1.1 Chimneys\nThe chimneys  have been characterized on their color, dimensions, morphologies, \n\ncohesion and bioturbation (Figure 26). Based on these parameters  the samples \n\nhave been divided in two main groups. \n\n69\n\nFigure 26: Examples of chimneys samples from TTR-14.\n\n\n\nOne group is  composed of chimney fragments, usually of brown-yellow-okra colors \n\nand more rarely with grayish colors. Those chimney fragments  of grayish colors \n\npresent, in general, a low or mean cohesion level and at the touch are \u201csandy\u201d, \n\nvery porous  and have irregular morphologies. On these samples  the bioturbation \n\nis low or inexistent.\n\nThe second group is composed by pipe-like chimneys. The samples of this group \n\nshow very dark-reddish colors  on the samples  exterior and have interiors of very \n\nlight and yellowish colors. These color variations is  interpreted as  resulting from \n\nthe oxidation of minerals  (such as  pyrite) due to the oxygenated seawater contact \n\nof the samples. This  process is  evident in some samples  that exhibit oxidation \n\nfronts spreading out from  the exterior of the sample and from  the open holes of \n\nburrows  where seawater was in contact with. The morphology of the chimneys is \n\nin general very constant and regular with pipe-like shape, in some of the cases. \n\nThey are very well cemented, very consolidated and hard, also in the inner part. \n\n70\n\nFigure 27: Examples of two crusts (a and c) and a concretion (b).\n\na\n\nc\n\nb\n\n\n\nOn this type of samples the levels  of bioturbation are very high, when compared \n\nwith the chimney fragments  type. In some of the chimneys colonization of the \n\nexterior part of the chimney by different types of benthic fauna, is  frequent and \n\nsometimes, very densely colonized.\n\nThe dimensions of the chimneys are very variable, ranging from  a few centimeters \n\nup to 30-40 cm long and with diameters up to 30 cm. \n\n 6.1.2 Concretions\nThe concretions have all been collected from mud volcanoes. They consist in a \n\nsemi consolidates  mud volcano mud breccias, cemented by carbonate minerals. \n\nThey have a grey color, in general a lighter grey. The concretions  are not well \n\nconsolidated and are in general very friable and are easily desegregated by hand \n\nor with a spatula. Concretions  have in general irregular or nodular shapes (Figure \n\n27b).\n\n 6.1.3 Crusts\nCarbonate crust samples  are very similar between them. They are grayish, very \n\nporous, and frequently show reddish intrusions or darker spots  (Figure 27a and \n\n27c). \n\nOnce all the different samples  were described and all the typologies  defined, \n\nselected specimens representative of all the different lithologies  were further \n\nanalyzed. Sub-samples  of the selected samples  were collected whenever changes \n\nin the composition, color, structure or texture were identified. Sub-samples were \n\ncollected along transversal or radial cuts on the samples where slices  were \n\ncollected for thin section preparation and petrographic microscopy observations \n\nand powdered sub-samples were collected with a hand micro-drill and further \n\nanalyzed for x-ray diffraction mineralogy, total organic carbon and carbonate \n\ncontent, carbon and oxygen stable isotopic composition.\n\nIn the photos  of Figure 28 is  showed the location of the sub-samples drilling points \n\nof the chimneys  samples. The concretions  are homogeneous  so all the sub-\n\nsamples of each sample are representative of the entire sample.\n\n71\n\n\n\n72\n\nFigure 28: Scans of the sample 600 G and the cutted surface of the chimneys samples. On that \nhave been identify the sub sampling point.\n\n\n\n6.2 Petrography\n\nThe petrographic observation and interpretation was  done on thin sections  of the \n\nchimneys  samples. The preparation of thin sections of the concretions  and crusts \n\nwas technically very difficult, due to the low cohesion of the samples that were not \n\nable to be efficiently polish, and therefore these samples  were not described under \n\nthe petrographic microscope.\n\nPetrographic characterization of chimneys\n\n73\n\nFigure 29: Microscope photos show examples of different textures of the thin sections.

Bioclasts of \n\nforaminifera and shell fragments (gastropods) are rare. \n\n\u2022 IV03_02: Very different texture than the observed in sample IV03_01, the matrix \n\nis  very dark, difficult to light penetration. It corresponds to a sparse bio-\n\nmicrite, wit abundant foraminifera bioclasts, higher than sample IV03_01, but \n\nnot enough to define it as  a packed biomicrite. Detrital quartz grains  were \n\nidentified as also some green and others yellow-reddish detrital grains. The \n\nbioclasts consist of foraminifera, gastropods and mollusk shell fragments.\n\n\u2022 IV04_01: Texture corresponds to a wachestone with abundant detrital grains and \n\nsome bio-clasts  inside a homogeneous micritic matrix, with slightly changes \n\nin color, from  orange to gray. Bioclasts are composed of foraminifera, shell \n\nfragments, gastropod, calcispheres and coccolitophoridae.\n\n\u2022 IV04_02: Intramicrite to packed biomicrite texture with a lot of bioloclasts, with \n\nsome pellets.

Bioclasts, detrital grains are very abundant. The \n\nmatrix is very fine and of dark brown color. Is possible to recognize changes \n\nin color and composition along the thin section, the matrix became gray and \n\nthe texture became more uniform; probably those areas  result from intrusions \n\nof clayish material or result from  sediment bioturbation. Considering the \n\ndetrital grains, they are both single minerals and poly-mineral rocks \n\nfragments. Several different crystalline detritals are observed. The bioclasts \n\nobserved in this  thin section are foraminifera, coccolitophoridae, gastropods, \n\nshell fragments (bivalve), echinoderms.\n\n\u2022 IV09_01: The texture of this sample is very similar to sample IV08_01. Has a \n\nvariable texture, ranging from fossiliferous micrite to packed bio-micrite. It is \n\npossible to distinguish high amount and largely variable bioclasts, rock clasts, \n\ndetrital minerals, in a brown-beige micritic matrix with sparse pelets. \n\nSpeaking about the detrital minerals and rocks fragments, is  possible to \n\nobserve in this  sample several different grains  of variable forms and colors: \n\nyellow, semi transparent, reddish, greenish, darkish particles  with \n\nhomogeneous structures pellets  and probably remains  of organic matter, \n\n\u201cfilamentous\u201d structure or crystalline polygonal structure.

The bioclasts are of foraminifera, \n\ncoccolithophores, gastropods, shell fragments and radiolarian.\n\n75\n\n\n\n\u2022 IV11_01: The texture is very variable, not uniform along the thin section, ranging \n\nfrom packed bio-micrite to fossiliferous micrite and intramicrite. The detrital \n\ngrains  are variable in composition and abundance, such as the bioclasts. The \n\nmatrix if very fine (micritic) with a dark brown color. Is possible to see in \n\nvarious  parts of the thin section that the matrix  changes in color and \n\ncomposition, locally becomes grayish; probably those areas  are result from \n\nclay intrusions  or from bioturbation. Considering the detrital grains  and the \n\nrocks  fragments, it is  possible to observe in this sample several distinct grain \n\nshapes  and compositions: yellow, semi transparent, greenish, darkish gains \n\nwith homogeneous  structures, \u201cfilamentous\u201d structure or very angular shapes. \n\nThe bioclasts are composed of foraminifera, coccolitophoridae, gastropods, \n\nshell fragments (bivalve). \n\n\u2022 IV14_01: This sample has a packed bio-micritic texture, and the detrital grains \n\nare composed predominantly by rock fragments  and mono-mineral detrital \n\ngrains.

Bioclasts are predominantly foraminifera tests but are very scarce. \n\n\u2022 IV16_01: This sample has a packed bio-micrite texture; clasts are almost entirely \n\ncomposed of bioclasts. The matrix of this  sample is  micritic, variable in color, \n\nranging from grayish to brownish and dark colors. Bioclasts are composed of  \n\nforaminifera tests, coccolitophoridae, gastropods, shell fragments  (bivalve), \n\nradiolarian, algae residuals, spicules, Bryozoa. \n\n\u2022 IV19_01: The texture is  ranges from  intramicrite up to a packed bio-micrite \n\ntexture. In most area of the thin section predominates the presence of \n\nangular detrital grains of rocks  fragments  and mono-mineral detrital clasts. In \n\nother areas of the thin section bioclasts, mainly foraminifera tests, \n\npredominate. The matrix is micritic and of brownish-dark color. \n\nAll the samples have a significant porosity. Different types of porosity can be \n\ndistinguished, from intra granular to inter granular porosity.\n\nMost of the samples exhibit evidences  of the initial phases  of typical diagenesis \n\nprocess such as  grain compaction, the recrystallization of foraminifera tests in the \n\n77\n\nFigure 32: Scans of the thin sections for the sampels IV11.01, IV14.01, IV16.01 and IV19.01\n\nIV11.01 IV14.01\n\nIV16.01\nIV19.01\n\n\n\ninside chambers walls, cementation, chemical compaction and fracturing.\n\n6.3 XRD\n\n6.3.1 Total Mineral Composition\nAll the results  of XRD has been elaborated and interpreted using the software \n\nMacDiff. In figure 33 is possible illustrated to see an example of the MacDiff \n\ninterpretation window of the diffractograms  that has  been done to have the results \n\nillustrated. The data obtained from  MacDiff has  been elaborated imported and \n\nanalyzed with Excel spreadsheet and plotted in R to obtain comparative data.\n\n6.3.1.1 Chimneys\n\nFrom  the mineralogy analyzed with the XRD is  possible to notice that, the three \n\ntypes  of carbonates defined based on their morphology and macroscopic \n\ncharacterization are also well recognizable characterized by a distinct mineralogy.\n\nAs show in figure 34 with the box plots graphs, the chimneys show, in the major \n\npart in general, high level abundance of dolomite with a range between 20% and \n\n78\n\nFigure 33: Example of diffractogram in Macdiff showing the peaks for calcite, dolomite and quartz\n\n\n\n79\n\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n72.70%, just one sub-sample has a value that is  very low: IV04.06 measures \n\n7.11% (table 3 and figure 34). The calcite percentage has  a bigger larger variability \n\nrange than the dolomite, in fact it goes  from  5.73 to 50.09% (table 3 and figure 34). \n\n81\n\nFigure 34: Box-plot of mineral composition for TTR 14 chimney samples. Box-plots indicate the \nminimum, maximum median and lower and upper quartiles for a variable. The box represents \nthe interquartile range  that contains 50% of values. The whiskers are lines or points that extend \nfrom the box to the highest and lowest values. A line  across the box indicate  the median. The \nnumber of sub samples used in the statistic elaboration in reposted as n and calcite and  dolo-\nmite are indicated by light and dark gray respectively.\n\n\n\nFor aragonite the chimneys doesn\u2019t seems  to follow rules, we have only minor (&lt;\n\n10%) amounts  of aragonite on 8 samples, with aragonite ranginge between 1.49 \n\nand 9.8%. is  always lower than the other two carbonate minerals in the chimneys \n\n(table 3 and figure 34). The detrital fraction are of course, depending from  the \n\ncarbonate content; the and it ranges  is  between 90% and 26.82% (table 3 and \n\nfigure 34). The sample with 90%, IV04.06, is  the one that has just a very low \n\namount of carbonate (7.11%) and is the lower value. Instead the higher value of \n\ncarbonates amount is 73%.  \n\nThe detrital fraction in the chimneys  is  composed mainly by quartz. Other minerals \n\npresent often in this  type of carbonates are include clay minerals, feldspar, \n\nplagioclase, illite and phyllosilicates.\n\nThe anomaly low carbonate content of represent by the samples IV04.06, can be \n\nhypothesized is interpreted as  resulting from the nature of this  sample. S it \n\ncorresponds to material that is infilling a borrow channel it does  not correspond to \n\nthe normal carbonate lithology but instead it corresponds to material that resulted \n\nfrom the metabolic activity of the borrowing organism  and from sedimentary and \n\ndigested material of the carbonate rock itself. Moreover, the LECO carbon content \n\nof this  sub-sample (figure 34) shows higher inorganic carbon content that has not \n\na crystallographic structure, indicating most probably an organic origin. A are due \n\nto the instrument: in fact, as explained in the previous chapter, the XRD read the \n\ncrystalline formation of carbonate, so probably this  sub-sample (that is an \n\nintrusion, as  you can see in figure 28) has carbon inside but not in a an crystallized \n\norganized form.\n\n6.3.1.2 Concretions\n\nThe concretions  have a different type of composition: the carbonate fraction is \n\nalways  composed by aragonite, calcite and dolomite, but the percentage \n\ncomposition is different. In these samples, the aragonite is  almost not present: just \n\ntwo sub-samples, IV20.06 and IV22.07, present it and only in a very low \n\npercentages, 0.32% and 0.40% respectively.\n\nThe dolomite is  more present but only in vestigial amounts  than calcite but \n\nhowever the range is very small, just ranging between 0.45% and 0.90%. The \n\nmajor carbonate mineral present in the concretion is  calcite, with the values that \n\n82\n\n\n\nrange for this mineral are between 23% and 73%. \n\nFour sub-samples (IV20.03 IV20.04 IV22.05 and IV22.06) have only they show \n\njust calcite as in the carbonate fraction, IV20.03 IV20.04 IV22.05 and IV22.06. The \n\ndetrital fraction is  related with the carbonate fraction and the ranges between \n\nvalues  are 25.62% and 75.74%. This fraction is  composed mainly by quartz and \n\nclay minerals, but also pyroxens and phyllosilicates.\n\n6.3.1.3 Crusts\n\nThe particularity distinctive feature of the crusts composition is  the presence of \n\naragonite presence, as  is possible to see in figure 36. This  mineral is present in \n\nalmost all the sub-samples, the values are very variables between 36.56% and \n\n0.57%. The range of the calcite abundance varies are between 76.89% and \n\n11.31%, the sub-sample IV27.08 is  composed, in the carbonate fraction, only by \n\nthis  mineral. The dolomite fraction has  a range of values  between 10.18% and \n\n80.59%; there is a sub-sample, the IV25.03, that is  totally composed by this \n\ncarbonate mineral. \n\nThe detrital fraction also has  a similar range of values, between 9.07% and \n\n50.71%. This fraction is  mainly composed by quartz clay and in almost all the \n\nsamples  is  present pyrite or simile other similar sulphur minerals  or their \n\ncorrespondent oxidized minerals  composed such as  by iron oxides. Are also \n\n83\n\nFigure 35: Box-plot of mineral composition for M86/5 concretion samples. Box-plots indicate the \nminimum, maximum median and lower and upper quartiles for a  variable.

Results  (table 3 and \n\nfigure 38) show normal or expected differences between the LECO and the XRD \n\nquantifications. These differences  result from  the different precision of these \n\nanalysis but also due to the fact that the XRD measures  the carbonate or mineral \n\ncontent by the crystallinity of their structure, while the LECO measures  the \n\nchemical abundance of elements such as  carbon. The difference accepted usually \n\nbetween the methods is  lower than 15%. In the samples  analyzed in this  thesis, \n\n84\n\nFigure 36: Box-plot of mineral  composition for TTR 15 and 16 crust samples.

Only the sub-\n\nsample IV04.06 has  a very large difference between the two methods: the \n\ncarbonate in XRD is  7.11% and 54.42% with LECO. This difference can be \n\nexplained by the methods  himself. In fact looking at the figure 28 this sub-sample \n\ncoincide to the white intrusion, this  can be formed by carbon and carbonate \n\ncontent that are not in a crystalline form, so it is  measured by LECO but not by \n\n86\n\nFigure 40: Column graph between quantification of carbonate fractions by \nXRD and LECO for TTR 15, TTR 16 crust and M86/5 concrection samples.\n\nFigure 39: Column graph between quantification of carbonate fractions by XRD and LECO for \nTTR 14 chimneys samples.\n\n\n\nXRD.\n\nThe total carbonate fraction of the chimneys determined with XRD have values \n\nranging from 49.57% to 73.18%, not considering the sample IV04.06, as  described \n\nbefore. The total carbonate fraction determined by LECO show values between \n\n54.42% and 77.78%. In the concretions  the carbonate content determined with \n\nXRD range between 24.26% and 73.38% while for LECO shows a variation \n\nbetween 17.64% and 73.67%.\n\nThe crusts also have similar variations in the total carbonate content: for XRD \n\nvalues  range from  49.29% up to 90.61% and for LECO ranges  between 57.91% \n\nand 89.74%.\n\nIn figure 38, that describe the correlations  between TOC (Total Organic Carbon) \n\nand the total carbonate fraction in the LECO measurement, in possible to see that \n\nall the samples follow a linear correlation and that only one sample seems  to be \n\nvery different from the others. This  abnormal sub-sample (IV22.04) corresponds to \n\na concretion that has  a very low value of total carbonate content when compared \n\nwith the other samples  and an abnormal high detrital and clay fraction, indicating a \n\nvery low cementation degree and therefore a very low amount of authigenic \n\ncarbonate phases and for this reason has a very low content of carbon.\n\nAs shown in figure 38, the correlation between the XRD and LECO total carbonate \n\nfraction quantifications, it is possible to notice that two samples  deviate from  the \n\nlinear correlation of these variables. These two abnormal sub-samples correspond \n\nto the concretion IV22.04 described above and the chimney sub-sample IV04.06 \n\nthat corresponds to the burrow channel infill, described above in this section.\n\n6.4 Isotopes\n\nCarbon (!13C) and oxygen (!18O) isotopic compositions  of the samples (For the \n\nisotopes  results, table 3 and figure 41) shows  the correlation between !18O and \n\n!13C for of the three groups of samples (chimneys, crusts and concretions) show a \n\nsignificant variability. While the Is possible to notice that, for !18O values show a \n\nconstancy of the values, there aren\u2019t big anomalies, all the samples are in a range \n\nbetween 2.482\u2030 (VPDB) and 5.976\u2030 (VPDB). Looking at the !13C values  show  \n\n87\n\n\n\nis possible to see a very large high variability, from -47.47 up to + 1.46\u2030 VPDB.\n\nTo be noted that the different carbonate types show partly overlapping but \n\ndistinctive compositional domains. The concretions  show the more negative !13C \n\nvalues  ranging between -29.54 and -47\u2030 VPDB and !18O values with low \n\nvariability (of about 4\u2030 VPDB). The crusts have intermediate !13C values (when \n\ncompared with the other carbonate types) varying from  -16.75 and -27.08\u2030 \n\nVPDB, corresponding to a narrow variability. Considering the oxygen isotopes \n\ncomposition, the crusts  have a larger range of values, varying from 2.13 and \n\n5.23\u2030 VPDB. The chimneys show highly variable !13C values, from about \n\n-21.92\u2030 VPDB up to +1.46\u2030 VPDB. The oxygen isotopic composition of the \n\nchimneys  also show a significant variability, ranging from 2.48\u2030 up to 5.97\u2030 \n\nVPDB. On the !13C - !18O domain the chimneys indicate a linear compositional \n\ntrend resembles  a system  with a mixture of two end members: one corresponding \n\nto negative carbon isotopic values  and the second end-member with isotopic \n\ncompositions with close to zero !13C values  and about 2\u2030 !18O values. These two \n\ncompositional end-members would correspond to methane rich fluids and the \n\nnormal seawater. Therefor it can be interpreted that the chimneys  would indicate a \n\nformation from pore waters representing a mixture of methane rich fluids  and \n\n88\n\nFigure 41: !18O vs !13C for the three types of samples. The values of the isotopes (VPDB) are \nexpressed in \u2030. \n\n\n\nnormal seawater. The concretions would represent a formation from  fluids clearly \n\nenriched in methane while the crusts  point to methane enriched source fluids but \n\nwith an intermediate composition. Some chimneys  sub-samples show abnormal \n\ncompositions, corresponding to a non-methane-derived source: there are, at list, \n\nfour anomaly samples. Two of these sub-samples are from  the chimneys group \n\nand are the (IV04.06 with a !13C value of -0.60\u2030 (VPDB) and IV16.02 with a !13C \n\nvalue of 1.46\u2030 (VPDB), that already resulted out of the ranges for the other \n\nanalysis, and IV16.02 that measure 1.46\u2030 (VPDB) correspond to a normal \n\nseawater source. This  is strange because, usually the methane derived authigenic \n\ncarbonates values  for !13C are negatives. As shown in figure 28, these two sub-\n\nsamples  correspond to the infillings of borrowings and therefor is normal that this \n\nmaterial have a non methane-derived formation process  and are instead \n\ncomposed by normal sediments and material resultant from the organic activity of \n\nthe burrowing organism, as  already observed on the mineral content of these sub-\n\nsamples.\n\nThe other two sub-samples  with close to normal seawater !13C values  (IV08.02 \n\nand IV08.03) are interpreted as being the result of a high detrital and a high \n\nbioclasts (that have seawater carbon isotopic values) contents.\n\nOther seems outside of the area of major concentration, are concretions: IV22.06 \n\nwith a value of !13C of -47.47\u2030 (VPDB) and IV22.07 that measure -44.98\u2030 \n\n(VPDB). Otherwise, also if those two are particularly negatives, all the concretions \n\nshows levels  of !13C lower than chimneys  and crusts. Also is possible to notice \n\nthat the graph show three distinct groups  of samples that coincide with the three \n\ntypes  of carbonates  considered in this master thesis. Looking at table 3 the range \n\nof values  for the three types  of carbonates  seem  to be ordered in three groups  on \n\nthe basis  of !13C. Otherwise the ranges values  of !18O for the three types of \n\ncarbonates are similar: between 2.48\u2030 (VPDB) and 5.97\u2030 (VPDB) for chimneys, \n\nbetween 3.78\u2030 (VPDB) and 5.23\u2030 (VPDB) for concretions  and between 2.13\u2030 \n\n(VPDB) and 5.23\u2030 (VPDB) for crusts. For !13C, instead, the ranges are very \n\ndifferent. The values  in chimneys  goes from  1.46\u2030 (VPDB) to -21.92\u2030 (VPDB), in \n\nconcretions maximum  and minimum  levels  are -29.54\u2030 (VPDB) and -47.47\u2030 \n\n(VPDB) and, in the end, for crusts  the interval is between -16.75\u2030 (VPDB) and \n\n89\n\n\n\n-27.08\u2030 (VPDB).\n\nLooking at the figure 42, that shows the oxygen isotope and the total carbonate \n\nfraction, is possible to see that only one sample (IV22.04) seems to be different \n\nfrom the others; this difference is not for on the isotopic values but is just for the \n\ncarbonate content. This  sample, that as  said described before, in section 6.3, \n\nshows an abnormally low content of carbonate content fraction.  All the other \n\nsamples  form a homogeneous  big group divided in two parts: one with concretions \n\nand chimneys  samples  and another (yellow triangles) with corresponding to the \n\ncrusts. This division is only mainly resultant of the distinctive imposed by the \n\ncarbonate content.\n\nIn the figure 43 is  showed the relationship between the main carbonate fractions \n\nmineralogy (such as  calcite, on the left, and dolomite, on in the graph on the right), \n\nand the !18O. For Dolomite, the crusts and the chimneys are mixed and it seems \n\nthat the samples of this  two types  follow a linear correlation trend. Otherwise the \n\nconcretions are almost all near the X-axes  as the dolomite content because the \n\ntrend of dolomite is very low. \n\nFor the calcite graph, things are most confused and is  not possible to recognize \n\n90\n\nFigure 42: Correlation between total carbonate fraction from LECO and the !18O isotope for the \nthree type of samples.\n\n\n\nany clear trend in it. The !13C isotopic compositions  show a larger variability and \n\nseem to better illustrate any changes in fluids compositions  from which the \n\ncarbonate minerals were formed from. Unlike the !18O, the carbon isotope is more \n\ndiscriminating and, considering figure 44, the three groups are well defined along \n\nthe axis X based on the C isotopic composition. The concretions are well divided \n\nfrom the crusts and the chimneys  than have overlapping compositional domains \n\nand, in part, mix.\n\nThis  picture shows also that the crusts  have a higher quantity amount of total \n\ncarbonate fraction content when compared with respect to the other two carbonate \n\ntypes  of carbonates. Only one sample (IV22.04), a concretion, seems  to be \n\ndifferent from the others, in relation respect to the total CaCO3 content. The other \n\ntwo samples  that are divided from the others  are (IV22.06 and IV22.07), are also \n\nconcretions, but they are discriminated by the values of !13C values that are the \n\nmore negative (-47.47\u2030 (VPDB) and -44.98\u2030 (VPDB) respectively).\n\nThe concretions seems to have more negative values  of !13C when compared with \n\nthe crusts and the chimneys. In fact, it is  possible to distinguish the three groups \n\nconsidering !13C variation, independently from the carbonate content, on the \n\nhorizontal curse: the more negatives values  correspond to the concretions. Than \n\nthe crusts, even observing an overlapping with the chimneys, have intermediate \n\n!13C values also if the higher values of them  mix a bit with the lower ones for the \n\n91\n\nFigure 43: Correlation between the two main carbonate fractions, Calcite and Dolomite, from \nXRD and the !18O isotope for the three type of samples.\n\n\n\nchimneys; and in the end there are the chimneys that have heavier !13C \n\ncompositions. Those samples  have one positive value for this isotope: 1.46\u2030 \n\n(VPDB) for the sub-sample IV16.02, as said before.\n\nOn figure 45, on the left side, is  shown the relationship between calcite content \n\nand !13C. Also in this  picture the three groups  are divided and clearly identifiable. \n\nThe concretions show a dispersed pattern domain, than the crusts and in the \n\nchimneys, also if mix a bit, the patterns seam to indicate preferably distinct trends. \n\nThe concretions are also well defined in a \u201cvertical way\u201d: in fact they show a high \n\ncontent of calcite and more negative of !13C values.\n\nThe chimneys, on the contrary, show the lower contents  of calcite and the higher \n\nvalues  of !13C. The crusts are in the middle between them  and represent an \n\nintermediary behavior. Again, is  notable IV22.04 with the lower levels  content of \n\ncarbonate, and therefore the lower level content of calcite. There are five sub-\n\nsamples  that don\u2019t have calcite and they are: IV04.06, IV10.02 and IV10.03 for the \n\nchimneys; and sub-samples IV25.01 and IV25.03, for the crusts.\n\n92\n\nFigure 44: Correlation between total carbonate fraction from LECO and the !13C isotope for the \nthree type of samples. \n\n\n\n93\n\nFigure 45: Correlation between the two main  carbonate fractions, Calcite and Dolomi-\nte, from XRD and the !13C isotope for the three type of samples.\n\nFigure 46: isotopes profiles for chimneys samples of TTR-14.

In some graphs  samples there are gaps  due to difficulties  in the \n\ncollection of the required powdered material or due to analytical errors  during the \n\nICP-MS measurements and had to be repeated and the results are still to be \n\nreceived.  Anyway, analyzing all the profiles, it is  possible to notice that they are \n\nvery distinct between them. In some sample, like IV04, IV16, IV22 or IV19, they \n\nseems to cross  each other and show inverse correlation between both isotopes. It \n\nmeans that as  one increase and the other decreases. Other samples, like IV10 or \n\nand IV13, the two isotopes  make the same bend; in other again they seems  to do \n\nthe opposite, like in IV16 or IV22. Other samples do not show any clear and \n\ndistinctive variation along his profiles, are just confusing. \n\n95\n\n\n\nChapter 7: Discussion\n\n7.1  Types of authigenic carbonates\n\nBased on the morphology, macroscopic and petrographic characterization and \n\nmineralogy, the studied samples  can be classified in three different groups: (1) \n\nchimneis, (2) concretions, and (3) crusts. These have distinct and characteristic \n\nmineral compositions, as is possible to see in figure 37 in the Carbonate Mineral \n\nComposition ternary plot. The chimneys carbonate fraction is characterized by the \n\npredominance of dolomite. The concretions  carbonate fraction is  composed, \n\nalmost exclusively, by calcite. The carbonate fraction of the crusts  shows a more \n\nvariable composition with the mineralogy including usually, both aragonite, calcite \n\nand dolomite. It is  possible to identify as a distinctive characteristic of this  type of \n\ncarbonate the presence and higher contents of aragonite. \n\nAs illustrated in Figure 37, the Principal Detrital Components Vs Total Carbonate \n\nfraction, it is possible to observe that all the samples from the three types of \n\ncarbonates are composed mainly by carbonate minerals, that as observed in the \n\npetrographic and isotopic composition, and the cement that lithifies a sediment \n\ndetrital fraction is composed by quartz grains, clays, bioclasts  and other minor \n\ndetrital grains  (feldspars, plagioclases, pyroxenes). The clay content is always \n\nminor that 10%. The Mg content on the calcite and dolomite minerals  (Table 3 and \n\nFigure 37), is determined by the positions of main peaks of the carbonate phases \n\non the XRD difractograms after their correction based on the quartz peak as \n\nreference. Thin ternary plot indicate that the carbonate phases  (calcite and \n\ndolomite) have stoichiometric or close to stoichiometric compositions. No Mg-\n\ncalcite neither proto-dolomite are present. \n\nThe carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of the studied samples also \n\ndiscriminate very clearly the three different types of carbonates (figure 41). It is \n\npossible to notice that the chimneys, concretions  and crusts  define three domains \n\nwith some overlapping in the chimneys  and crusts domains. Concretions show \n\nmore negative !13C values  and fairly constant !18O values. The chimneys show \n\nhigh variability on the !13C values  \n\n96\n\n\n\n7.2 Methane-derived origin of these carbonates\n\n \n\n7.2.1 Fluids Nature: seawater and Methane\n\nThe inference of the isotopic composition of the carbon pool from the carbonate \n\nmineral one is  complex, because the mineral composition may reflect mixing from \n\nthe different carbon sources. Fractionation of the carbon will also depend on the \n\nextent to which the different carbon reservoirs are oxidized. However, it is possible \n\nto estimate the !13C composition of the fluids that permit the authigenic \n\ncarbonates precipitation from, and is possible at least identify the different carbon \n\nsources. \n\nThe carbon isotopic composition of the studied samples: chimneys  (with the \n\nexception of the sub-samples IV04.06 and IV16.02), crusts  and concretions, \n\nindicate that they originated from  a moderate to extremely 13C-depleted reservoir, \n\nwith some variable mixture with normal seawater 13C reservoir (especially in \n\nsamples  IV08.02 and IV08.03). Therefore the C isotopic composition of these \n\ncarbonates indicate a clear methane-derived origin of these authigenic \n\ncarbonates.\n\nFor isotopic light carbon signature, two principal sources  can be considered: (1) \n\ndecomposition of organic mater, that result in typical pore waters  !13C values of \n\nabout -25\u2030 VPDB, and (2) methane and higher hydrocarbons  oxidation products \n\n(Claypool and Kaplan, 1974; Rosenfeld and Silverman, 1959) that produces  pore \n\nwaters !13C values of less  than -20\u2030 VPDB (-20\u2030 up to -110\u2030 VPDB). In the \n\nGulf of Cadiz two potential sources  of methane can be considered: thermogenic \n\nand biogenic origin (Hensen et al., 2007; Niemann et al., 2006; Nuzzo et al., 2007; \n\nStadnitskaia et al., 2006). Typically, biogenic methane formed by CO2 reduction or \n\nby fermentative decomposition of organic matter by micro-organisms at shallow \n\ndepths is extremely fractionated in 13C, typically with !13C values  between -50\u2030 \n\nand -110\u2030 VPDB (Claypool and Kaplan, 1974; Schoell, 1988) and thermogenic \n\nmethane is  isotopic less fractionated ranging from  -50\u2030 to -20\u2030 VPDB (Schoell, \n\n1980, 1988).\n\n97\n\n\n\nAnother potential important source of carbon to the total carbon pool from \n\nwhich these carbonates were precipitated is  the dissolved carbon from  normal \n\nseawater and HCO3-  derived from  dissolution of carbonate tests, both with !13C \n\nvalues  ~0\u2030 (VPDB). Given the petrographic characteristics of the chimneys and \n\nthe crusts indicate a week diagenetic degree and therefore formation within \n\nshallow sediment column, and that in the case of the concretions were collected at \n\n80 cm and 250 cm depth bellow the seafloor. \n\nThe studied samples have !13C values  heavier than biogenic methane, \n\ntherefore mixing with of the several carbon sources  is  probable. Thus, it is  possible \n\nto propose that the authigenic carbonates most probably reflect a mixing of \n\nmethane-rich fluids (thermogenic and biogenic methane) with non-methane carbon \n\nsources where seawater is the most important. \n\n!13C values  of the studied samples (figure 44) are typical from carbonates \n\nformed at methane vents  (Bohrmann et al., 1998; Greinert et al., 2001; Hovland et \n\nal., 1987; Kulm and Suess, 1990; Kulm  et al., 1986; Paull et al., 1992; Peckmann \n\net al., 2001; Ritger et al., 1987) and correspond very well with methane-derived \n\nauthigenic carbonates from other sites  in the Gulf of Cadiz (Magalh\u00e3es, 2007 and \n\nMagalh\u00e3es  et al., 2012), as  illustrated in figure 49. In this comparison with \n\nmethane-derived authigenic carbonate samples from  other structures in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz it is possible to notice that two sub-samples  from  chimneys  (IV04.06 and \n\nIV16.02) are very out of the normal expected depleted 13C values also reported in \n\nthe literature as normal for MDAC. As discussed before, these sub-samples \n\ncorrespond to sedimentary infill\u2019s  of burrows, being this  the reason for these \n\nabnormal values. Also the sub-samples  IV08.02 and IV08.03 present values of \n\n!13C very high -3.92\u2030 and -2.71\u2030 VPDB (Figure 49), close to the normal \n\nseawater composition (close to 0\u2030 VPDB). This is interpreted as being the result \n\nof the fact that sample IV08 present a very high level of bioturbation and bio-\n\nerosion. In fact, as  illustrated in figure 28, this sample is  highly burrowed, has  high \n\namount of remains  of tube worms, benthic organisms  attached to the burrow \n\ntunnels  that are very close to the drilling points. It means  that probably during the \n\ndrilling procedure has been collected not only the carbonate rock material but also \n\nshell fragments or biological components  that altered the results, especially the \n\n98\n\n\n\nisotopes.\n\nFrom  figure 49 it is  possible to recognize also that the isotopic composition of \n\nother MDAC samples collected in other sites  of the Gulf of Cadiz (Magalh\u00e3es, V. \n\n2007) show that the crusts (Dolomite crusts in the figure) have highly variable \n\nisotopic compositions, similar to the observed in the crusts  of this  study. Also, the \n\nchimneys are very similar to the chimney samples in this study. \n\nRelatively to the isotopic compositional variation within the individual samples, \n\nalong radial and longitudinal profiles  on the crusts  and chimneys (figure 46, 47 and \n\n48) no clear and distinctive trend can be defined. As already mentioned in the \n\nresults section, there are some samples  in which the two isotopes  seem to \n\nincrease or decrease together, some other cases  in which the trend is  opposite \n\nand others in which is not clear.\n\nOn the other hand, relatively to the relationship between the isotopic composition \n\nand the carbonate fraction (total carbonate, dolomite and calcite) it is possible to \n\nrecognize a linear good correlation for the chimneys. In fact, looking at figures  42 \n\nand 44 is possible to define a general trend that is  very clear for chimneys \n\nsamples: as the carbonate content (of the cement) increases, the !18O becomes \n\nheavier and the !13C becomes more negative. This  can be interpreted as reflecting \n\n99\n\nFigure 49: !18O and !13C values of the samples used in this thesis (colored ones) compared with \nthe isotopic composition of samples collected in other sites of the Gulf of Cadiz (Magalh\u00e3es, et al., \n2012) plotted in black-gray color. \n\nIV04.06\n\nIV08.02IV16.02\nIV08.03\n\n\n\nthat as  methane-derives authigenic carbonates  are precipitated, increasing the \n\ncementation, these methane-derived isotopic signal (heavier !18O and depleted \n\n!13C) will also increase, compared with the normal seawater signal (!18O and !13C \n\nvalues  close to 0). This  global trend between these two end-members  is \n\nrecognized on the chimney samples but is not observed along each individual \n\nsample. On the crusts and concretions this  process of mixture is not recognized, \n\npossibly the number of analyzed samples is not sufficient to show this process.\n\n 7.2.2 Anaerobic oxidation of methane\n\nThe textural characteristics  of the samples, corresponding to a formation within the \n\nsedimentary column, but with a low diagenetic degree, with the presence of pyrite, \n\nidentified by XRD, and the recollection of the concretions at shallow sedimentary \n\ndepths, indicates  that these carbonates were formed within the sediments but \n\nbelow the zone of oxic diagenesis, in an anoxic environment. This  implies \n\nanaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) via sulphate reduction (SR) as  typical in \n\nthe methane-derived authigenic carbonates. Therefore, we can consider that these \n\nsamples  are formed as  consequence of the upward migration of methane rich \n\nfluids, probably with minor amounts of reduced carbon-compounds, and the \n\nanaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in the Sulphate Reduction Zone (SRZ), \n\naccording to the microbially mediated (Boetius et al., 2000) net chemical reaction \n\n(Reeburgh, 1980):\n\n                           CH4 + SO 4 2- \" HCO3 - + HS - + H2O\n\nAs the AOM increases the alkalinity of the pore fluids and isotopic light methane \n\ncarbon is  converted to bicarbonate, aragonite, Mg-calcite and dolomite, with light \n\ncarbon isotopic ratio precipitates  cementing the pore spaces  of shallow sediments \n\nand their lithification, forming therefore these carbonate samples. Sulphide, that is \n\nanother product of the coupling AOM + SR will be precipitated as  pyrite, dissolved \n\nin the seawater and an important amount of it will be consumed by sulphide-based \n\ncommunities.\n\n100\n\n\n\n7.3 Relative formation ages\n\nIn relation to the formation ages  of the different types of MDAC it is possible to \n\ndistinguish the concretions  from  the chimneys and crusts. The concretions, as \n\nwere sampled in situ through gravity coring, at 80 and 250 cm  depth bellow the \n\nseafloor, the petrographic characteristics, with high porosity, absent of oxidized \n\nminerals (no iron oxides present) and the presence of pyrite, indicates  a very \n\nrecent or present-day formation. This  is also supported by the pore water \n\ngeochemical data, where the methane and sulfate profiles  indicate these depths \n\n(80 and 250 cm depth bellow the seafloor) correspond to the present-day zone of \n\nsulfate-methane transition zone (Magalh\u00e3es, pers. comm), therefore the zone \n\nwhere AOM-SR is more intense and the precipitation of MDAC is  expected to \n\noccur more intensely. On the other hand, the petrographic and mineralogical \n\ncharacteristics  of the crusts and chimneys, with high oxidized minerals (oxy-\n\nhydroxide minerals), absence of pyrite or other sulfate minerals indicate the \n\ncontact of these samples  with the oxidizing seawater after being formed within the \n\nsedimentary column. This is  also supported by the intense colonization of the \n\nsamples  by benthic fauna and their intense burrowing. Therefore the crusts and \n\nchimneys  correspond to older MDAC than the concretions. The crusts and \n\nchimney samples  after being formed within the sedimentary column, would have to \n\nbe exhumed from  the sedimentary column, most probably due to the strong \n\nerosive effect of the sea bottom  currents  of the MOW that flows  at the sites  (MOW \n\nchannel in front of the Gibraltar Strait, the Vernadsky ridge, the Pen Duick \n\nescarpment, the Mercator and Meknes mud volcanoes) where these samples \n\nwere collected from.\n\nThe samples IV22.06 and IV22.07 have been recovered in a core on top of the \n\nMichael Ivanov Mud Volcano. This  two sub-samples  present the lower levels  of \n\n!13C, respectively -47.47\u2030 (VPDB) and -44.98\u2030 (VPDB). This  can be related to \n\nthe fact that near the sampling point, has been proved and investigate, during the \n\nM86/5 cruise, the presence of gas hydrates. \n\n101\n\n\n\n 7.4 Formation model\n\nThe data collected permit to make some hypothesis on the formation processes of \n\nthese different types of carbonate. \n\nThe chimneys and crusts, according to the formation model proposed by \n\nMagalh\u00e3es  (2007), are the result of expulsion of methane rich fluids along \n\npathways  of fluid circulation and escape, formed by (hydraulic) fracturing or along \n\nsedimentary discontinuities  such as borrows. In fact if chimneys  and crusts  had \n\nformed above the seafloor, by upward growth of carbonates, in the same way of \n\nsulfide chimneys  in hydrothermal vents, they should contain a very small or none \n\ndetrital fraction, facts not supported by the petrographic observations of these \n\nthesis samples, where the detrital faction composes a very significant fraction of \n\nthe rock (usually about 50%). For the chimneys, considering their morphology, the \n\ndegree of oxidation, the colonization and bioturbation by the benthic fauna, usually \n\nhappen after the chimneys  are cropped out. Therefore the chimneys  with a more \n\nintense oxidation degree have been exposed to the seawater for longer periods of \n\ntime and correspond to samples exhumed from shallower depths  in the sediment \n\ncolumn. In contrast, the ones without or with only weak oxidation signs and \n\nbioturbation have had a shorter period of exposure to the seawater and \n\ncorrespond to a formation deeper inside the sediment column. In general the \n\ndolomite crusts correspond to cemented sedimentary layers while the dolomite \n\nchimneys correspond to cemented fluid conduits.\n\nSediments  with low permeability, like clay rich sediments will develop open vent \n\nchannel chimneys  and show lighter !13C and heavier !18O. Sediments with high \n\npermeability will develop chimneys  with closed vent channels and sometimes  with \n\nconcentric growth structures. The different concentric rings can reflect different \n\nepisodes of venting with different intensities and different fluid compositions, or \n\nmixing fronts between the methane rich fluid and the seawater pore water.\n\nIn sites  of higher flux of methane-rich fluids, migrating from  deeper parts of the \n\nbasin through the sediments, like occurs at the mud volcanoes, under anoxic but \n\nseawater ventilated environmental conditions (high sulfate concentrations), \n\nauthigenic precipitation is  dominated by aragonite and calcite. This  is  the formation \n\n102\n\n\n\nenvironment proposed for the crusts considered here. \n\nConcretions are different: they show a main composition by calcite and very low \n\nlevel of dolomite (<1%), aragonite appear just in two sub-samples  (IV20.06 and \n\nIV22.07). In this case, the range of the carbon isotopic composition varies between \n\n-29.54\u2030 and -47.47\u2030 VPDB. This characteristics fit very well with the MDAC \n\nconcretions described by Greinet et al., 2001; Lein, 2004 and Magalh\u00e3es et al., \n\n2012.  Relatively to the oxygen isotopic composition, the concretions  described in \n\nthis  study, that were collected from the Michael Ivanov mud volcano show a \n\nsignificant enrichment in the heavier oxygen isotope. This enrichment can be \n\nexplained with the presence of gas hydrates during the formation of these MDAC \n\nsample type. In fact, during the R/V Meteor cruise M86/5 gas hydrates  were found \n\nand recollected from the Michael Ivanov mud volcano at depths of 80 cm bellow \n\nthe seafloor. The concretions analyzed in this thesis  can therefore be interpreted \n\nas having a formation related with the presence of gas hydrates.\n\nIt was  also possible to notice that, relatively to the chimney samples  analyzed in \n\nthis  work and comparing in with published results from  other samples in the Gulf of \n\nCadiz, the one from  this work seem to cover a different range of !13C \n\ncompositional values. In fact, the samples  reported from Magalh\u00e3es et al. (2012) \n\nshow a range of !13C ranging between -30\u2030 and -60\u2030 VPDB, while our samples \n\nhave values  between -10\u2030 and -25\u2030 VPDB. Therefore it have been proposed \n\nfour hypothesis that can explain this difference:\n\n\u2022 The chimney samples  reported in this study presents  different sources areas \n\nthan the previously reported in the Gulf of Cadiz (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2012). \n\ntherefore these samples can reflect different gas compositions;\n\n\u2022 The chimney samples analyzed in this thesis may represent a higher seawater \n\ninfluence with corresponding !13C values closer to 0 VPDB;\n\n\u2022 The chimney samples reported in this study may exhibit late diagenetic \n\nalterations that have modified the !13C values\n\n\u2022 Alternatively, the detrital minerals of the sediments, that are cemented by MDAC \n\nprecipitated, may have different compositions that significantly change the !13C \n\nvalues of the bulk sample to slightly heavier compositions.\n\n103\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Conclusions \n\nIn conclusion, in this  work were described, for the first time, authigenic carbonate \n\nsamples  from  six sites  in the Gulf of Cadiz, for the first time in two of these sites. \n\nResults of this  study prove that all the authigenic carbonates  analyzed in this \n\nthesis are methane-derived (MDAC). The mineral composition and the isotopic \n\nvalues have permitted to divide the samples in three main types: \n\n1. Chimneys, tightly carbonate-cemented, medium light grey to light brown color \n\nsandstone/mudstones. Those are sub-divided into two groups based on their \n\nmorphology, one reddish-brownish, with high bioturbation, high cohesion and \n\nvery well cemented; the other group of chimneys has yellow-grayish okra colors, \n\nwithout bioturbation signs and with lower cohesion. These two groups  represent \n\ndifferent intensities  of exposion of the chimney samples to the seawater after \n\ntheir exhumation from  the sediments in which they were formed. The formation \n\nof the chimneys is  associated with the methane-rich fluids  migration and escape \n\ninto the top of the sedimentary column or into close to the sea bottom. In fact, \n\nthe chimneys correspond to cemented fluids conducts. The mineralogy shows \n\nboth calcite and dolomite minerals  as  main carbonate fraction, in some samples \n\naragonite can be present in minor quantities  (&lt;10%). The detrital fraction is, in \n\ngeneral, high confirming the formation of these samples  below the seafloor, \n\nwithin the sediments. Oxygen and carbon isotopes are typical and prove their \n\nformation by anaerobic methane oxidation and their methane-derived origin.\n\n2. Crusts  show both the three carbonate minerals: aragonite, calcite and dolomite, \n\nin variable percentages  and have a formation process  that is  similar with the \n\ndescribed for the chimneys. The detrital fraction on the crusts  is  in general lower \n\nthan on the chimneys so, the crusts have been formed in an environment in the \n\nsedimentary column with higher pore spaces  and therefore more superficial. \n\nThe isotopic composition of the crusts is  in agreement with the formation model \n\ndescribed by Magalh\u00e3es et al. (2012). \n\n3. Concretions have a carbonate fraction dominated by calcite. The detrital content \n\nis  higher than on the crusts or the chimneys. Concretions  isotopic composition  \n\n104\n\n\n\nagree with the isotopic composition of MDAC samples  described in the \n\nliterature. Comparing them  with the other types of the studied authigenic \n\ncarbonates show an enrichment in !18O, due to the formation in the presence of \n\ngas hydrates (Greinet et al., 2001).  \n\nThese samples show a clear relationship between carbonate fraction and the \n\nisotopic composition: an increase in the carbonate content is correlated with a \n\ndecrease in !13C values and an increase in !18O values. In particular, considering \n\nthe two main carbonate minerals, calcite and dolomite, it is  possible to observe \n\nthat an increase in the calcite content is  fallowed by a decrease in the !18O values \n\nand the opposite variation of the !13C values. Increases  of the dolomite content is \n\nfollowed by increases of the !18O  values and decreases in the !13C values.\n\nThe majority of the studied samples have a detrital content higher than  30%, this \n\nis  interpreted as indicating that the carbonate formation occurs within the \n\nsediments. The major components  of the detrital fraction correspond to typical \n\nhemipelagic sediments. The crusts and concretions have pyrite, arsenopyrite and \n\nother iron sulfide minerals indicating a formation in anoxic environments, near the \n\nSRZ. \n\nImprovements on the understanding of the methane-derived authigenic \n\ncarbonates formation processes, especially in the case of the crusts, imply more \n\nanalysis  and more studies  such as  petrographic characterization with \n\ncathodoluminescence methods, Scanning-Electron Microscopic studies and \n\nStrontium isotopic studies, that were not available in this project timeframe. Also, \n\nthe investigation of the relationship between gas  hydrates and the formation of \n\nauthigenic carbonates  in the Gulf of Cadiz should be pursuit, requiring the \n\nanalyses of a larger number of concretion samples. \n\nA future development of this  work, including further analysis, is also important to \n\nunderstand if the observed differences  between the chimneys described in this \n\nwork and the chimneys in the Gulf of Cadiz described in the literature are resulting \n\nfrom one of the hypothesis that have been proposed in this thesis.\n\n105\n\n\n\n References\n Web references\n\n\u2022 http://www.geol-pal.uni-frankfurt.de/Staff/H omepages/Petschick/PDFs/MacDiff%20Manual\n%20E.pdf\n\n\u2022 http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/of01-041/index.htm\n\n\u2022 http://www.science.uottawa.ca/eih/ch9/9stront.html  \n\n\u2022 http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/geol212/carbonates.htm\n\n\u2022 http://ocean.tamu.edu/Quarterdeck/QD5.3/sassen.html\n\n\u2022 http://www.martinhovland.com/mud_volcanoes.htm\n\n\u2022 http://www.isotechlabs.com/analytical/isotope/carbon.html\n\n\u2022 http://www.logitech.uk.com/\n\n\u2022 http://www.iso-analytical.co.uk/carbon.html\n\n\u2022 http://www.isotope-analysis.com/\n\u2022  http://www.geomar.de/en/research/expeditionen/detail-view/exp//314699/\n\n\u2022 http://www2.geo.ua.pt/mvseis/Mud_volcanoes.htm\n\n\u2022http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/of01-041/index.htm\n\nPapers \n\nAbbate, E., Balestrieri, M.L., Bigazzi, G., Ventura, B., Zattin, M., Zuffa, G.G. 1999.

Convert the excel file with the data in a .txt (ex: iv04.txt)\n\nII. Open R statistic and change the work spaces. To do that I went to \u201cMisc\u201d and select \n\u201cchange work directory\u201d, then select the one that I need, in which I saved the .txt file.\n\nIII. Import the file in R with iv04<-read.table(\"iv04.txt\")\n\nIV. Now  the file is imported to check it just wrote iv04 and enter the code;  should appear \nthe table like in figure 34. \n\nV.   Now, if all the data are the correct ones, give the command to do a Boxplot graph \nwith groups, this is important because it needed a division in the same samples \nbetween different minerals and fractions.\n\n The script is:        boxplot(iv04$V2 ~ iv04$V1)\n\n where V2 and V1 are the variable that R have to consider respectively on the X and \n\n116 Nome resoconto\n\nFigure 50: screenshot of R-statistics showing an example of data input from .txt file.\n\n\n\n Y axis. In this cases, the types of fractions on the horizontal axis and the values in % \n on the vertical.\n\nVI. Then just give the enter command and the plot appear in a separate window. \n\nVII. Go on \u201cfile\u201d---> \u201csave as...\u201d and save it. \n\n117\n\n\n\nAnnex II\n\nGCD kit extension\nThe GCDkit is and extension of  R specific for the GeoChemical Data. In this master thesis \nhas been used to elaborate the ternary plot for the mineralogy.\n\nTo graph a ternary plot in GCDkit:\n\nI. Prepare a correct excel file, with the title of  each column just in the first row  and data \nstart from the second. In this way the software read directly the different variables in \nthe excel file.\n\nII. click on \u201cData\u201d then \u201cload data files\u201d and select your file.\n\nIII. than select the sheet where are your data and upload it in GCDkit.\n\nIV. Now the table is uploaded. You can check it going of \u201cdata\u201d---> \u201cshow table\u201d\n\nV. Now, to plot different groups of  samples (in this case chimneys crusts and \nconcretions) I have splitted data in group. Click on \u201cData holding\u201d than \u201cSet group \nby...\u201d and in the end \u201c...labels\u201d , Now  press Enter and it should appear the list of \nparameters contained in the sheet. The parameter that I have used was  the \u201cType\u201d \ncolumn.\n\nVI. Now  that the group are set click on \u201cPlots\u201d and then \u201cternary plot\u201d and select from the \nlist (it appear clicking the Enter button) the parameters that you want.\n\nVII. Select all the samples and let it run and the ternary plot appear in a separate window.\n\nI have also changed the colors  and the symbols  for the groups to have simplier reading \nplot. To do this:\n\nI. Click on the menu \u201cPlot editing\u201d select \u201cSymbols/Colours by group\u201d and select \u201cShow \nAvailable symbols\u201d or \u201cShow available colours\u201d \n\nII. It will appear the list that shows the symbols and colours and a table to full-in with the \ngroups in the first column (chimneys, concretions and crusts) and symbol and colour \nin the second and third.\n\nIII. Enter the identification number for symbols and colours in the table.\n\n118 Nome resoconto\n\n\n\nIV. Give the Enter command and close it. \n\nV. The plot is ready to be saved ( \u201cFile\u201d--->\u201dSave as...\u201d) \n\n119"}]}}}
