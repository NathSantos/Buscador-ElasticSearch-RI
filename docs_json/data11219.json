AVS and SEM concentrations were,\nin general, higher in the core sediments from areas which receive a higher anthropic contribution\ndue to urban pollution. In these cores, the sulfide seemed to be the main connection for the\nmetals. In the core obtained from the area of major marine influence, the most important binding\nphases for the metals seemed to be associated with organic matter and carbonates. The AVS\nprofiles allow identification of two types of sedimentation processes in the estuary. In all cores\nSEM/AVS ratios were much lower than 1.\n\nKeywords: sediments, heavy metals, acid volatile sulfide, simultaneously extracted metals\n\nIntroduction\n\n Sediments are formed by deposition of layers of\nfine particulate matter onto the beds of rivers, lakes,\nestuaries and oceans. They function as an important\ncompartment of the aquatic ecosystem and serve as\nhabitat of many species of organisms. They comprise\nmineral phases of varied sizes, including clay, silt and\ns a n d ,  m i xe d  w i t h  o rga n i c  m a t t e r. A n  i m p o r t a n t\ncharacteristic of sediment is its capacity to serve as a\nreservoir for trace metals introduced into the aquatic\nenvironment by natural geochemical processes and\nanthropogenic activities.1,2\n\nDi Toro et al. 3 suggest that the concentration of metal\nin the pore water can be controlled by acid volatile sulfide\n(AVS), via the formation of insoluble metal sulfide\ncomplexes. Several laboratory studies have demonstrated\nthe AVS influence over the bioavailability and acute\n\ntoxicity of divalent metals in aquatic sediments.2,4-6 When\nthe sediments show excess of AVS in relation to the\nsimultaneously extracted metals (SEM/AVS<1) the pore\nwater metal concentrations are considered to be low and\nnon-toxic.7 Some research has shown a significant\nbioaccumulation for sediments with SEM/AVS<1.8,9\n\nThe sulfide level in sediments is a function of the\nproduction rate of sulfide by reduction of sulfate, and\nthe loss rate of sulfide by oxidation reactions and\ndiffusion processes.10,11\n\nBerner describes diagenetic sulfide formation as a\nfunction of porosity, sediment density, mixing intensity,\norganic matter supply, SO\n\n4\n in pore water diffusion\n\ncoefficient, rate of SO\n4\n reduction and SO\n\n4\n concentration\n\nat the water-sediment interface.12\n\nConsequently, AVS profiles can provide information\ndescribing the depositional process of the sediment in each\ncore. Some studies of this nature have been carried out.13,14\n\nOehm et al.15 concluded that only one core cannot\ncompletely represent sedimentation in the environment,\n\n\n\n749Alves et al.Vol. 18, No. 4, 2007\n\ndue to spatial differences in the supply of reactive organic\nmatter. Some studies have been carried out in coastal\nsediments.\n\nIn the present study, three sediment cores from\ndifferent locations of the Sergipe River Estuary were\nanalyzed with the purpose of investigating the AVS, SEM,\ntotal heavy metals and the relationships of these profiles\nwith the dynamics of the estuarine environment.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStudy area\n\nThe Sergipe River basin is located in the State of\nSergipe, in the Northeast of Brazil. It covers an area of\n3673 km2 and has an average flow of 560,000 m3 day-1 in\nthe rainy season and 70,000 m3 day-1 in the dry season.\nThe river runs about 210 km from its spring to its mouth\ninto the Atlantic Ocean in the city of Aracaju, Capital of\nthe State.16\n\nThe study area has an extension of 15 km covering\nthe lower part of the Sergipe River Estuary and the\nestuarine region of the Sal and Poxim Rivers (Figure 1).\nWithin this area the cities of Aracaju, Nossa Senhora do\nSocorro, S\u00e3o Cristovao and Barra dos Coqueiros are\nlocated, which together make up an extension of 859.3\nkm2 and are home to 37.9% of the population of the State.\nThe estuary directly receives industrial sewage, dominated\nby emissions from food, plastic, textile, ceramic and\n\nmetallurgical industries. Domestic sewage waste waters\nare also released into the estuary, in natura, from the\nneighboring cities, and as the effluent from sewage\ntreatment facilities in Aracaju.\n\nThe estuarine region is characterized by a well-mixed\nwater column, with a circulation standard mainly\ndominated by the tidal currents. Lately, the estuary has\nshown hypoxic conditions and characteristics of an\nenvironment in process of eutrophication. The more\nimpacted areas are those of the Sal and Poxim Rivers,\nwhere the oxygen dissolved in water has shown levels\nbelow 3.00 mg L-1, at some locations reaching values close\nto zero.17\n\nSampling\n\nIn the present study, three sediment cores were\ncollected in September 2004, in the estuarine region\nformed by the Sal River (core 1; 10\u00b051\u00b451\" S, 37\u00b005\u00b401\"\n\nW), Sergipe River (core 8; 10\u00b054\u00b409\" S, 37\u00b002\u00b425\" W) and\nPoxim River (core 19; 10\u00b056\u00b424\" S, 37\u00b005\u00b416\" W). The\nlocation of the sampling sites is indicated in Figure 1.\n\nThe sediments were taken with a core sampler of\ncellulose acetate-butyrate pipe type, with precaution to\nprevent destruction of the core, using non-metallic devices\nto avoid contamination. Each sediment core was field-\nsliced at 5 cm interval, as it was expelled from the core\nsampler. The samples were rapidly stored in closed plastic\nbags with ice to minimize oxidation. The samples to be\n\nFigure 1.

Soc.\n\nused for AVS determination were, as recommended in the\nliterature,18-20 maintained in the refrigerator at 4 \u00b0C and\nanalyzed within a maximum period of four days after\ncollection. The samples intended for metal determination\nwere immediately dried in a forced air circulation oven at\n60 \u00b0C for 72h (until reaching a constant mass) and then\nwere homogenized by crushing in a porcelain mortar until\na fine powder was obtained. Following this, they were\nsealed in previously cleaned glass flasks until analyzed.\n\nChemical analyses\n\nThe procedure adopted for determining AVS and SEM\nwas based on the methodology described by Di Toro et al.3\n\nAbout 12 g of wet sediment at room temperature were\ntransferred to a closed reaction vessel, connected to a\ntrapping vessel containing 20 mL of 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH\nsolution. To the wet sediment sample was added 30 mL\nof 0.5 mol L-1 HCl, forming H\n\n2\nS which was subsequently\n\ncollected in the NaOH solution by purging with N\n2\n for 40\n\nminutes. The dissolved sulfide in the NaOH solution was\npotentiometrically titrated in an automatic system\n(Radiometer TM 865) with a 0.03 mol L-1 AgNO\n\n3\n solution\n\nusing a sulfide selective ion electrode with Ag/AgCl\nreference electrode.\n\nHCl and sediment mixture in the reaction vessel were\nseparated by centrifugation and the concentrations of the\nsimultaneously extracted metals (SEM) in the solution were\ndetermined by flame or graphite furnace atomic absorption\nspectrometry (FAAS/GFAAS) (Shimadzu AA-6800).\n\nFor evaluating the efficiency of the AVS extraction\nmethod, a standard Na\n\n2\nS (79.18 mg L-1) solution was used,\n\nobtaining in three replications an average recovery of 93\u00b13%.\nThe results of the measurements in duplicate of the AVS\nshowed an analytical precision of less than 10%. In the\nextraction process for AVS determination, blanks with 0.5\nmol L-1 HCl solution were prepared similarly to the samples,\nand concentrations in the blanks were negligible for all metals\nmeasured in the SEM determination.\n\nSediment samples (0.5 g), dried to constant mass at\n60 \u00b0C, were digested in closed Teflon vessels using a\nmixture of concentrated HNO\n\n3 \n(2 mL), HCl (1 mL) and\n\nHF (4 mL), at 140 \u00b0C for 2 hours on a heating block.\nAfter digestion, the Teflon vessels were opened and\nmaintained at 210 \u00b0C until complete dryness. The residue\nwas dissolved in 10 mL of 0.5 mol L-1 HCl solution and\nthe final volume made up to 50 mL. The solutions were\nstored in polyethylene flasks for later determination of\nthe metals by flame or graphite furnace atomic\nabsorption spectrometry. Reagent blanks were prepared\nsimilarly to the samples, and the following certified\n\nsediment standards were analyzed for quality control\npurposes: LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada lake sediment; NCS\nDC 75304/China river sediment; NCS DC 78301/China\nmarine sediment. The results showed that there was no\nsignificant contamination and that the recovery of the\nheavy metals in the reference materials was in the range\n92-106%.\n\nThe measurement of the total carbon content in the\nsamples was carried out using an Elemental Analyzer\n(NCHS-O, Flash EA 1112) with combustion at 900 \u00b0C.\nThe organic carbon content was calculated from the\ndifference of the carbon values measured before and after\ncalcination of the samples at 550 \u00b0C for 1 hour. For quality\ncontrol purposes a certified Lake Sediment standard\n(LKSD-1 CCNRP/Canada) was analyzed together with\nthe samples, obtaining in three replications an average\nrecovery of 96.3 \u00b1 4.2%.\n\nPrincipal Components Analysis (PCA) and calculations\nof correlation coefficients were carried out using the\nprogram \u201cStatistica for Windows Version 6.0\u201d.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nCharacteristics of the sediments\n\nThe chemical characteristics of the sediments in the\nthree cores are shown in Table 1. The method of Principal\nComponents Analysis was applied to the sets of chemical\nparameters measured in the fractions of the cores with\nthe objective of detecting a possible grouping between\nthem. PCA is a non-parametric method of classification,\nemployed to reduce the dimensionality of a data set while\nattempting to preserve the relationships present in the\noriginal data. The method consists in applying the\nmultivariate statistical analysis on the results obtained,\nconsidering each fraction as an object (5 fractions of core\n1; 8 of core 8 and 8 of core 19) and the parameters\nmeasured as variables (12 variables). With the purpose of\nassuring that the relative influences of the different\nvariables on the model were independent of the units of\nthese variables, the columns of the data matrix were self-\nassigned so that the new variables had zero average and\nunit variance.\n\nTwo principal components were extracted, together\nrepresenting 76.8 % of the total variance ( t\n\n1\n 57.0%; t\n\n2\n\n19.8%). Based on the weight of the contribution of each\nvariable in the PCA (Table 2) it can be seen that Cu, Cd,\nNi, Zn, Cr, Al and C\n\norg\n are strongly associated with\n\ncomponent t\n1\n and Mn and Pb with component t\n\n2\n.\n\nThe location of each fraction on the coordinate plan\nformed by the two components t\n\n1\n and t\n\n2\n is shown in Figure\n\n\n\n751Alves et al.Vol. 18, No. 4, 2007\n\n2. The first component (t\n1\n) separated the core 1 fractions\n\n(negative part of t\n1\n) from the core 19 fractions (positive\n\npart of t\n1\n). The fractions located in the negative region of\n\nt\n1\n (core 1) show higher contents of Cu, Cd, Ni, Zn, Cr, Al\n\nand C\norg\n\n. The second component (t\n2\n) separated the core 8\n\nfractions (negative part of t\n2\n) from the core 1 and 19\n\nfractions (positive part of t\n2\n). Mn and Pb principally\n\ncontributed to this separation, with the fractions of the\nnegative region of t\n\n2\n showing higher concentrations of\n\nMn and lower concentrations of Pb.\nThe organic carbon has a significant participation in\n\nthe construction of component 1, evidenced by the\nassociation of these variables with the anthropic input due\nto urban pollution. On the negative side of t\n\n1,\n the metal\n\nconcentration increases and on the negative side of t\n2\n, the\n\nconcentration of Mn increases and Pb decreases.\nTherefore, core 1 is mostly distinguished from the others\nby showing a higher metal average concentration (except\nMn), associated with a higher anthropic contribution,\nwhile the principal characteristics of core 8 are the high\nMn concentrations and lower Pb concentrations.\n\nThe vertical distribution of AVS and SEM\n(?Cd\n\nSEM\n+Cu\n\nSEM\n+Ni\n\nSEM\n+Pb\n\nSEM\n+Zn\n\nSEM\n) in the three sediment\n\ncores is shown Figure 3.

Braz. Chem. Soc.\n\nthe concentrations of AVS were higher than the\nconcentrations of SEM, consequently the SEM/AVS\nrelationships were much less than 1 and the SEM-AVS\ndifferences less than zero. When the SEM/AVS molar\nproportions are less than 1, the concentrations of the metals\nin the pore water are supposed to be small and non-toxic\nand, therefore, the sediments should not present acute\ntoxicity for aquatic organisms concerning heavy metal\ncontents.7\n\nIn core 1, the AVS varied between 13.7 and 23.7 ?mol\ng-1, with a peak at 5 cm. In core 8, the AVS varied between\n1.9 and 13.6 ?mol g-1, with a very low concentration at\nthe surface, a peak at 5-10 cm, and concentrations\ndecreasing gradually down to a depth of 25 cm and then\nremaining about constant. In these two cores, the AVS\ndistribution profiles are characterized by peaks a few\ncentimeters beneath the water-sediment interface. These\nprofiles are typical for non-steady depositional processes\nwith instabilities during deposition, such as changes of\nthe size of the particles, in the permeability, porosity\n\netc.13,21 In core 1, the AVS concentrations were higher than\nin core 8; this difference can be attributed to the higher\ncontent of organic matter in the sediments of core 1, caused\nby the effluent input from the sewage treatment station in\nthat region. The least concentrations in the top layer are\ndue to the transference of O\n\n2\n from the overlying water to\n\nthe surface sediments, leading to reduction of the AVS\nconcentration by oxidation.22 This profile format was\nobserved in cores of sediments of lake Donghu (China)23\n\nand was attributed to the large flow of organic matter to\nthe sediments, originating in domestic and industrial\nsewage released into the lake. As the generation of AVS\noccurs through reduction of sulfate to sulfide by sulfate\nreducing bacteria, and these organisms need carbon for\ntheir metabolism,24 the presence of large quantities of\norganic matter potentially contributes to making the\nsediment anoxic, inhibiting oxidation of AVS in the surface\nlayers. Core 8 was collected in a region of major marine\ninfluence and in that region, probably, SO\n\n4\n2\u2013 reduction is\n\nmore important for AVS formation than the input of\n\nFigure 2.

The high SO\n4\n\n2\u2013 concen-\ntrations (20-30 mmol L-1) in marine sediments, compared\nwith those of the fresh water sediments (0.2 mmol L-1)\ncan account for a greater part of the anoxic oxidation\nprocesses in those sediments.31\n\n In core 19, the AVS varied between 2.2 and 18.0 ?mol\ng-1. The AVS content was lower at the surface and showed\n\nan increase along its profile with peaks at 15 and 35 cm.\nThe profile showed a high gradient with a more or less\ncontinuous increase in AVS content with depth. In\naccordance with Van der Berg et al.13 this profile indicates\na deposition process in steady state with limitations by\nSO\n\n4\n2\u2013\n\n, \ncharacterized by a low average deposition rate.\n\nGerritse argues that the low speed of deposition leads to\nthe formation of higher quantities of sulfide in the more\nanoxic layers, because more sulfate is reduced per unit of\ndepth.25 This profile has been reported in distribution\nstudies of AVS in sediments.26-30\n\nThe first concepts concerning the control and\nabundance of AVS in anoxic marine sediments were\nestablished in the late 1970s. It was observed that in rapidly\ndeposited sediments AVS tends to occur in greater\nproportion relative to pyrite and that, in sediments which\naccumulate slowly, AVS is a small fraction of total reduced\nsulfide (TRS) or even absent, even when pyrite is present\nin abundance. The low abundance of AVS is due to the\nrapid and complete transformation of FeS to pyrite in the\nupper sediment layer. The slow accumulation process\nfavours direct formation of pyrite from H\n\n2\nS, which can\n\nlead to relatively little AVS.32\n\nOne of the first studies concerning the behaviour of\nAVS in marine sediments (Aller, 1977, in Morse and\nRickard33) considers AVS as comprising FeS or a mixture\nof metastable iron sulfides. Maximum AVS occurs within\nthe zone of greatest TRS formation and coincides with\nthe depth at which dissolved Fe decreases to very low\nlevels and dissolved sulfide increases rapidly. Aller\u2019s\nconclusion is that the reservoir of FeS at any given depth\nis the result of the balance obtained between the rates of\nFeS formation (HS\u2013 production, and reaction with Fe) and\nloss (conversion to pyrite, oxidation to Fe3+, SO\n\n4\n2\u2013), at that\n\ndepth.\nIn a recent review article on AVS Rickard and Morse32\n\ncite several studies which used a 35S tracer to investigate\nthe mechanisms controlling the relationship AVS-pyrite.\nIn the work of Panutrakul et al.,34 on sediments of the\nScheldt estuary in Belgium, using 35SO\n\n4\n2\u2013, the main final\n\nproduct was found to be AVS (70-80%), except in\nsuperficial sediments where pyrite and So predominated,\nindicating the oxidation of sulphide. Close to the surface\nof sediments (0-5 cm) AVS constituted around 13% of\nTRS, reaching around 30% in deeper layers. According\nto Rickard and Morse,32 these observations could indicate\nthat in the deeper sediment layers the net sulfide\nproduction (formation minus oxidation) is greater than\nthe rate of conversion of AVS to pyrite. Preservation of\nAVS is favoured by rapid deposition and by low oxygen\navailability at the sediment-water interface. During rapid\n\nFigure 3.

Braz. Chem. Soc.\n\ndeposition the sediment is removed rapidly from the zone\nwhere most of the oxygen transport via diffusion or bio-\nirrigation occurs.\n\nTable 3 and Figures 4, 5 and 6 show the distributions\nof the total metals and SEM for the three cores.\n\nIn core 1, the Cu, Pb and Zn profiles are similar and\nindicate increasing concentrations with depth. Cd showed\nlittle variation, with similar concentrations at the different\ndepths. Ni showed an enrichment as far as 10 cm of depth\nand then its concentration was reduced, becoming similar\nto the upper layers.\n\nCore 8 showed similar profiles for Ni, Pb e Zn, with a\ngeneral enrichment of the metals with depth. The Cd\nconcentration decreased along the profile and the Cu\nconcentration showed a profile different from the other\nmetals, with peaks at 10 and 40 cm of depth.\n\nCore 19 showed a general enrichment with depth for\nCu, Ni, Pb and Zn and presented a peak at 15 cm. In spite\nof Cd presenting a peak at 15 cm, it did not show any\nenrichment with depth.\n\nIn relatively stable aquatic environments, an\nenrichment of metals in the surface layer of the sediment\nis expected as a result of inputs related to industrial\nactivities and urban development.35 In the region under\nstudy, mainly cores 1 and 19 were obtained from locations\nthat in recent years have shown significant urban and\n\nindustrial growth. Notwithstanding, in the studied cores\nenrichment of metals was detected in the surface layer\ndue to the fact that the sediments reflect a non-stable\nsedimentation process, as a function of the depositional\ndynamic of the estuarine environments. Similar\nobservations have been made for sediments of the Pearl\nRiver in China.14\n\nIn general, the vertical distribution of the SEM showed\nfor each metal the same distribution trend as that of the\ntotal metal. The SEM concentrations for most of the metals\nrepresented a relatively large fraction of the total metal\nconcentrations (Figure 7). The highest SEM/metal ratios\nwere shown by Cd in cores 1 and 8 (from 51 to 97% of\nthe total Cd) and by Cd and Zn in core 19 (from 27 to\n72% of the total metal), followed by Pb in core 8 (from\n17 to 59%) and Zn in core 1 (from 26 to 49%). In the\nthree cores, the ratios varied from about 6 to 40%, with\nCu presenting lowest ratios (1 to 5%). High SEM/metal\nratios may indicate that the AVS was the most important\nphase for the metals in the sediment. The low Cu\n\nSEM\n/Cu\n\nratio was probably due to the metal not being sufficiently\nsoluble in HCl under the AVS extraction conditions. Some\nwork has shown that Cu2+ is more strongly associated with\nthe organic phase of the sediments and that this can have\na minor contribution in the binding of Cu2+ to the\nsediment.36-38\n\nTable 3.

Further, they detected that\nthere was a significant correlation between Cd\n\nSEM\n, Pb\n\nSEM\n\nand Zn\nSEM\n\n and the concentration of the metal in the sulfide\nphase. This indicates that these metals are more strongly\nbound to the AVS and this can control the bioavailability\nof these elements. Cu\n\nSEM\n and Ni\n\nSEM\n were little soluble in\n\nHCl and were better associated with the organic phase\nthan with the AVS; this phase, better than the sulfide, can\ncontrol the bioavailability of these metals.\n\nA significant correlation was observed between Cd\nSEM\n\n(r=0.82), Cu\nSEM\n\n (r=0.95), Pb\nSEM\n\n(r=0.67), Zn\nSEM\n\n (r=0.96)\nand the AVS in core 1 and between Cd\n\nSEM\n (r=0.67), Cu\n\nSEM\n\n(r=0.73),Ni\nSEM\n\n (r=0.75), Pb\nSEM\n\n (r=0.52), Zn\nSEM\n\n (r=0.56)\n \nand\n\nthe AVS in core 19, evidencing a strong association\n\nbetween the metals and the sulfide in those sediments.\nThe correlation between Ni\n\nSEM\n (r=0.24)\n\n \nand AVS was weak\n\nin core 1 suggesting that, in this case, sulfide may not\nhave been an important contributor to binding of the metal\nin the sediment.\n\nIn core 8, in contrast to the other two cores, no\ncorrelation between the AVS and the SME was detected,\nindicating that in these sediments, sulfide does not seem\nto be the principal phase of metal-binding.

Principal components analysis (Figure 2)\ndemonstrated that the main difference between the\nsediments of core 8 and the sediments of cores 1 and 19\nare the high manganese concentrations.

This results in the formation of a Mn (II)\nreservoir, normally associated with the carbonate phase,\nas rhodocrosite-calcite or dolomite of the Ca-Mn type.\nSo, much reduced manganese cannot be available for the\nformation of mineral sulfide.43-45\n\nYu et al.,46 when studying the spatial distribution of\nthe AVS and SEM in sediment cores of the Ell-Ren River\n(Taiwan), detected the existence, besides AVS, of other\n\nbinding phases for the SEM, that is, the total\nconcentration of the SEM does not correspond only to\nthe metals bound to AVS. Comparing the spatial\ndistribution of the SEM/AVS relationship with several\nbinding phases in extremely anoxic sediments (redox\npotential between \u2013115 and \u2013208 mV), they concluded\nthat the organic phases and the carbonates were, after\nthe AVS, the principal binding phases for the SEM. They\nalso observed that in slightly anoxic sediments (redox\npotential between \u201350 and \u2013130 mV), the iron oxides\nwere the additional principal phase for zinc and the\norganic matter for copper. In all cases, the AVS seemed\nto have binding priority for the SEM.\n\nFigure 5.

Core 1 is mainly distinguished from the\nothers by showing higher average metal concentrations\n(except Mn), associated with a higher anthropic\ncontribution, while the principal characteristics of core\n8 are the high Mn concentrations and lower Pb\nconcentrations.\n\nBased on the AVS profiles in each core, two types of\nsedimentation processes were identified, a non\u2013steady\nprocess with instabilities during deposition (cores 1 and\n8) and a depositional process in steady state characterized\nby a low average deposition rate (core 19). Preservation\nof AVS is favoured by low oxygen concentrations in the\noverlying water.\n\nIn the sediments from the estuarine region of the Sal\nand Poxim Rivers, the sulfide seems to be the principal\nmetal-binding phase, while in the region of the Sergipe\nriver the most important metal-binding phase seems to be\nassociated with the organic mater and the carbonates. The\nelevated concentrations of manganese in sediments from\nthe Sergipe river region could have resulted in formation\nof a large sink reservoir of Mn(II), associated with the\ncarbonates phase. In all three cores, SEM/AVS ratios were\nmuch less than 1.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Andrew Allen\n(University of Birmingham) for his assistance with the\nEnglish in this manuscript and CNPq (Process 620065/\n2004-4) and FINEP (Process 0828/03) for financial support\nof this study.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
