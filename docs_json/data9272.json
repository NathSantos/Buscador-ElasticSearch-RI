During this period, calculus techniques were applied to \napproximate discrete problems by continuous ones.\u201d \nMathematical analysis, WIKIPEDIA \n \n\u201cEngineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily \navailable, they will create their own problems.\u201d \nScott Adams (1957 - ) \n \n\u201cIt always seems impossible until it\u2019s done.\u201d \nNelson Mandela (1918 - 2013) \n\n\n\n IX \n\nABSTRACT \n\nNowadays, significant research effort in low-permeability rocks (a wide \ntendency elsewhere and soon in the Brazilian petroleum industry) has \nbeen focused on pore-scale petrophysics, morphologies and \ndistributions, as well as fluid flow circulation described by the values of \npermeability. The evaluation of these properties in turn is essential for \nthe assessment and exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves; however, \ndetermining pore system parameters in such rocks as tight gas \nsandstones (TGS) and seal rocks (SR) remains challenging because of \nthe extreme variability in depositional environments resulting in \ncomplex pore structures comprised by clays and length scales from sub-\nmicrons to Angstroms. In this work we applied a set of techniques to \ncharacterize submicron-pore structures in TGS and SR. Therefore it was \ndivided into two main topics of interest: (i) Characterization of \npetrophysical properties and pore systems in very low permeability TGS \nusing Pulse-Decay Permeability (PDP), Low Field Nuclear Magnetic \nResonance (LFNMR), Nitrogen Gas Adsorption (N2GA), Mercury \nIntrusion Capillary Pressure (MICP) and Multi-scale 3D X-ray Nano- \nand MicroCT (down to 0.7 ?m resolution) techniques; (ii) Study of \nPhotoacoustic Spectrometry (PAS) for determining thermal diffusivity \n(TD) and porosity in three seal rocks originating from dissimilar fields \nas a key issue for safe exploration, storage purposes (CO2 sequestration) \nand developments in shale characterization. The values obtained for TD \nwere between 0.01667 and 0.09298 (cm2/s) while porosity ranged from \n1.42 to 9%. For the analyzed TGS the 3D pore-structure characterization \nlead to pore tortuosity and shape factors ranges of 2.19-5.47 and 3.2-8.5, \nrespectively, and pore size distributions tended to be bimodal for MICP, \ntrimodal for 3D multi-scale and tetramodal for LFNMR measurements. \nThe porosity values ranged from 1.94 to 11.96% obtained by the \ncombination of N2GA and MICP techniques and permeability from \n0.036 to 0.00066 mD by PDP technique. The measured pore-structure \nparameters were also used to predict empirical permeability in TGS \n(using e.g. Carman-Kozeny (Dullien, 1992) and Coates (1999) models). \nThe set of applied methods has shown to be a useful tool for the \nunconventional reservoir characterization since it allows obtaining pore \nmorphological and quantitative parameters which account for the \npermeability values.  \n \nKey-words: Tight gas sandstones, Seal rocks, rocks characterization \n\n\n\n X \n\n\n\n XI \n\nRESUMO \n\nHoje as pesquisas em rochas de baixa permeabilidade (grande tend\u00eancia \nno mundo e em breve na ind\u00fastria petrol\u00edfera brasileira) se voltam \u00e0 \nescala de poros seja para investiga\u00e7\u00e3o petrof\u00edsica, morfol\u00f3gica, de \ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanhos de gr\u00e3os ou poros ou escoamento de fluidos, \npr\u00e1tica descrita pelos valores de permeabilidade. A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o destas \npropriedades por sua vez, \u00e9 essencial ao desenvolvimento e explora\u00e7\u00e3o \nde reservas de hidrocarbonetos. No entanto, a determina\u00e7\u00e3o de \npar\u00e2metros do sistema poroso nessas rochas, arenitos de baixa \npermeabilidade (TGS) e rochas selantes (SR), continua a ser um grande \ndesafio devido \u00e0 extrema variabilidade de ambientes deposicionais e \ncomplexa microestrutura composta por argilas e tamanhos de poros de \nsubm\u00edcrons a \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms. Nesta tese empregou-se um conjunto de \nt\u00e9cnicas experimentais para a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura porosa de TGS \ne SR. De tal modo, o trabalho foi dividido em dois t\u00f3picos principais: (i) \nCaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema poroso e propriedades petrof\u00edsicas em TGS \nutilizando-se as t\u00e9cnicas de permeabilidade por decaimento de pulso \n(PDP), NMR de baixo campo, adsor\u00e7\u00e3o gasosa N2 (N2GA), porosimetria \npor intrus\u00e3o Hg (MICP), nano- e microtomografia de raios X (res.&lt;0,7 \n?m); (ii) Estudo por espectrometria fotoac\u00fastica (PAS) em SR de \ndistintos campos geol\u00f3gicos para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o de porosidade e \ndifusividade t\u00e9rmica (TD), de forma a estimular a explora\u00e7\u00e3o segura de \ng\u00e1s e \u00f3leo, o armazenamento de CO2, bem como a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de \nfolhelhos. Para SR os valores de TD variaram entre 0,0167 e 0,0930 \n(cm2/s) e a porosidade entre 1,42 e 9%; para TGS a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o 3D da \nestrutura porosa forneceu valores de tortuosidade e fator de forma entre \n2,19-5,47 e 3,2-8,5. As distribui\u00e7\u00f5es de tamanho de poros mostraram-se \nbimodais nos ensaios MICP, trimodais na multiescala 3D e tetramodais \nna NMR, enquanto a porosidade pela combina\u00e7\u00e3o N2GA e MICP variou \nentre 1,94 e 11,96% e a permeabilidade PDP de 0,036 a 0,00066 mD. \nAlguns dos par\u00e2metros microestruturais obtidos em TGS foram \ncorrelacionados na estimativa de permeabilidade utilizando-se modelos \ncomo Carman-Kozeny (Dullien, 1992) e Coates (1999). O conjunto de \nt\u00e9cnicas e metodologias aplicado nesta tese mostrou ser ferramenta \nimprescind\u00edvel na caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de rochas de baixa permeabilidade, \numa vez que permitem integrar atributos da rede de poros que \ninfluenciam nas macro-propriedades das rochas analisadas. \n \n\nPalavras-chave: Arenitos de baixa permeabilidade, rochas selantes, \ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de rochas. \n\n\n\n XII \n\n \n\n\n\n XIII \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \nFigure 1.1: Scope of material science and engineering including the \n\nprocess of extraction for the case of rock\u2019s analysis (modified from \nNATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, 1989). ............................... 1 \n\nFigure 1.2: World primary energy demand by sector and type in the \nWEO 2011 New Policies Scenario.................................................. 3 \n\nFigure 1.3: (a) Definitions of primary and secondary migration (TISSOT \nand WELTE, 1984); (b) Schematic geology of natural gas \nresources, EIA. ................................................................................ 5 \n\nFigure 1.4: Gas/oil resource triangle (modified from NAIK, 2004; \nCAPP). ............................................................................................ 6 \n\nFigure 1.5: (a) The surge in unconventional oil and gas production has \nimplications well beyond United States, WEO-2012.

INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1. Materials characterization \n In material science and engineering, characterization refers to the \napplication of external techniques (experimental analyses) to probe into \nthe internal structure and properties of a material (WIKIPEDIA). \nFundamentally, material science is the investigation of the relationship \namong processing, structure, properties, and performance of materials \u2013 \nwhich comprises a systematic characterization (CALLISTER, 2002). In \nFigure 1.1 this relationship is summarized considering that in the \ncharacterization of natural materials such as reservoir rocks from the \npetroleum industry, the processing can be simply replaced by extraction \nprocess, once that the analyzed material (natural rock) had been already \nprocessed for ages. \n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nCHARACTERIZATION\n\nPROCESSING \nor \n\nEXTRACTING\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nPROPERTIES\n\nLevels of arrangement of \ninternal components:\n- subatomic;\n- atomic;\n- microscopic;\n- macroscopic (bulk).\n\n- Material characteristic;\n- response to external stimulus;\n- mechanical, electrical, \nthermal, magnetic, optical, \ndeteriorative \n\n- Method of preparing \nmaterial or; \n- extracting an natural \nmaterial to be analyzed\n\n- Behavior in a particular \napplication\n\nSTRUCTURE\n\nCHARACTERIZATION\n\nPROCESSING \nor \n\nEXTRACTING\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nPROPERTIES\n\nLevels of arrangement of \ninternal components:\n- subatomic;\n- atomic;\n- microscopic;\n- macroscopic (bulk).\n\n- Material characteristic;\n- response to external stimulus;\n- mechanical, electrical, \nthermal, magnetic, optical, \ndeteriorative \n\n- Method of preparing \nmaterial or; \n- extracting an natural \nmaterial to be analyzed\n\n- Behavior in a particular \napplication\n\n \nFigure 1.1: Scope of material science and engineering including the process \n\nof extraction for the case of rock\u2019s analysis (modified from NATIONAL \nRESEARCH COUNCIL, 1989). \n\n Understanding the relationship among structure, properties, \nprocessing/origin, and performance of materials is fundamental for any \ntechnological development and benefit to the society. In the beginning \nof the material science, humans began to make tools from stone; started \nto hammer or cast bronze in a variety of shapes; use iron and steel as \nstronger and cheaper material changing drastically daily life of a \ncommon person; and finally many new types of materials have been \nintroduced, such as ceramic, semiconductors, polymers, composites, etc. \nAll these events are historically associated to Ages to be known as Stone \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n2              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n? Bronze ? Iron Age; and why not add the Advanced Materials Age. \nMaterial engineers and scientists are at the head of new technologies, \nprocess fabrication and characterization. Theu push forward the \nboundaries of science and engineering interacting with researchers and \nprofessionals of every discipline, including the petroleum engineering. \nResearch and development on petroleum engineering areas can assure a \nsafe and optimized hydrocarbon extraction leading to the increase and \nautonomy of the energy in all sectors of societies worldwide.  \n\n1.2. Motivation and context \n\n1.2.1. World primary energy demand and hydrocarbons role \n\n According to YUSGIANTORO (2004): \n \u201cThere is a sheer importance of energy for the evolution of \nmankind. Petroleum has long been the main source in the world \nenergy and is expected to remain into the 21st century. However, \nthere are challenges in the years ahead in an industry which is \nhighly competitive and operates at the sharp end of technology. \nE.g., producers must meet the estimate rising oil and gas demand \nin a manner which is both timely and compatible with such \nobjectives as sustainable development and social, economic and \nenvironmental harmony.\u201d \n\nAdditionally new energy resources must be developed to assure the \ndevelopment of societies. Figure 1.2 shows the world primary energy \ndemand (in million tons of oil equivalents) by sector and type for 2008 \nand the perspective for 2035 (WEO-2011).  \n In Figure 1.2 it is possible to see that (referring to the sum of \nthese resources) even for the years ahead, all the economy sectors will \nstay reliant on the gas, oil and coal natural resources. Facing the needs \nof the global energy scenario, the search for hydrocarbon resources is \nintensified pressuring to enhance the recovery in conventional \nreservoirs, and even further: to the exploration and development of \nresources once considered impracticable - the unconventional reservoirs. \nIn this context and in view of the growing production from rocks with \nsmall pore sizes, closely analyzing the properties of rocks of \nunconventional reservoirs becomes increasingly important for geologists \nand petrophysicists, as recovery of gas and oil from fine-grained \nsandstones, siltstones, and shale blurs the distinction between reservoir \nand seal (NELSON, 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             3 \n\n \nFigure 1.2: World primary energy demand by sector and type in the WEO1 \n\n2011 New Policies Scenario. \n\n1.2.2. Insights about the petroleum system \n\n The petroleum system is a unifying concept that encompasses all \nof the disparate elements and processes of petroleum geology. Practical \napplication of petroleum systems can be used in exploration, resource \nevaluation, and research. The essential elements of a petroleum system \ninclude (MAGOON and BEAUMONT, 1999; HAO et al., 2000): \n\n- Source rock; \n- Reservoir rock; \n- Seal rock; \n- Overburden rock. \n\nLinking these elements to the processes of petroleum geology (trap \nformation and hydrocarbon generation\u2013migration\u2013accumulation) is an \neffective exploration approach. Mapping and studying a petroleum \nsystem helps explorationists predict which traps will contain petroleum \nand which will not. It also helps them focus on that part of a region that \nwill most likely contain accumulations (MAGOON and BEAUMONT, \n1999). Figure 1.3(a) exemplifies a cross section showing a structural \nanticline trap where the oil and gas accumulation is performed by the \nseal (cap) rock capacity. One can also see the primary and secondary \n\n                                                        \n1 WEO \u2013 World Energy Outlook. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n4              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nmigration processes. Primary migration is the process by which \nhydrocarbons are expelled from the source rock into an adjacent \npermeable carrier bed (reservoir rock). Secondary migration is the \nmovement of hydrocarbons along the reservoir rock from the source \narea to the trap. Migration mostly takes place as one or more separate \nhydrocarbons phases (gas or liquid depending on pressure and \ntemperature conditions). The ideal situation for the petroleum industry \nrecovery would be to have reservoir rocks comprised by enough amount \nof connected pores (effective porosity) attributing considerable values of \npermeability to the explored oil/gas field. \n1.2.3. From conventional to unconventional reservoirs \n\n For more than 100 years conventional resources have been the \nfocus of the oil and gas industry. Although conventional and \nunconventional oil and gas come from the same original geologic \nformations (sediments accumulated in multiple layers in sediment basins \nall over the world) they have distinct characteristics. Conventional \nreservoirs are resources from which no special exploration process \nneeds to be applied in the recovery since rock and fluid characteristics \ntypically permit oil or natural gas to flow readily into wellbores. Usually \nthey show high to medium permeability values (> 0.6 mD) and are \ndrilled vertically just by the natural pressure of the wells and pumping \nor compression operations. On the other hand, unconventional reservoirs \nrequire special recovery operations in order to make it monetarily \nviable; they do not produce economic volumes of oil and gas without \nassistance from massive stimulation treatments or special processes and \ntechnologies, such as hydraulic fracturing or steam injection (NAIK, \n2004). Unconventional reservoirs have low permeability (<0.1 mD \ngoing even to the nD order) and are usually drilled horizontally or by \nmultistage hydraulic fracturing (NAIK, 2004; PERRY and LEE, 2007). \nThe optimum drilling, completion and stimulation methods for each \nwell are a function of the reservoir characteristics and the economic \nsituation. Like conventional hydrocarbon systems, unconventional gas \nreservoirs are characterized by complex geological and petrophysical \nsystems as well as heterogeneities \u2014 at all scales (RUSHING et al., \n2008). \n The unconventional gas resources (tight gas, coalbed methane, \nand shale) will play a significant role in world energy supply because of \ntheir potential to offset declines in conventional oil and gas production \n(DARABI et al., 2012; PHILIPPE &amp; PARTNES, 2011). In conventional \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             5 \n\nreservoirs hydrocarbons are stored in the interconnected pore spaces of \nsands and carbonates and often sourced from proximal organic-rich \nshales; in shale gas or tight gas reservoirs, they are stored in \ninterconnected pore space (mineral matrix) or adsorbed onto organic \nmatter (kerogen or bitumen) and often sourced from the same reservoir \nrock. Figure 1.3(b) depicts, e.g., a schematic geology of natural gas from \nwhere one can see the main differences within reservoir characteristics \nand recovery processes; Figure 1.4 illustrates the principle of the natural \nresource triangle available in the world and studied by different authors.  \n\n   (a) \n\n   (b) \nFigure 1.3: (a) Definitions of primary and secondary migration (TISSOT \n\nand WELTE, 1984); (b) Schematic geology of natural gas resources, EIA2. \n\n The concept of the resource triangle to find a large gas field was \nfor the first time used by Masters in 1979 were all natural resources are \n\n                                                        \n2 EIA \u2013 US Energy Information Administration. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n6              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\ndistributed log-normally in nature (MASTERS, 1979). As it can be seen \nin the scale on the right side of Figure 1.4 the hard part is finding high \npermeability gas and oil fields. Once you find a high-grade deposit, \nrecovery producing in the resource is rather easy and straightforward. \nThe common theme is that low quality deposits of gas/oil require \nimproved technology and adequate gas prices before they can be \ndeveloped and produced economically; however, in deposit volumes \nthey are much larger if compared to high quality ones (WIKIPETRO \u2013 \nTight Gas Reservoirs). \n\n \nFigure 1.4: Gas/oil resource triangle (modified from NAIK, 2004; CAPP). \n\n Since the 1950s, the oil and gas industry has been completing and \nfracture treating low permeability wells in the United States. Nowadays \nthe unprecedented interest worldwide, the high resource volume, long-\nterm potential and attractive prices bring the unconventional gas and oil \nreserves into the forefront of our energy future. Figure 1.5 shows the \nUnited States conventional and unconventional gas/oil reserves \ntransformation from 1980 to 2035 (a) according to WEO-2012 data; and \n(b) illustrated the gas evolution for China, Canada and US in 2008 and \n2035 (source: EIA). As one can see for US in 2008, more than half of \ngas production was already ensued from unconventional fields. Also for \nCanada and China in 2035 the prevision reaches 50 and 70%, \nrespectively. In this context it is significant that Brazil advances \ndevelopments and studies in unconventional resources to assure the \nprospects of the Brazilian energy matrix. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             7 \n\n (a) \n\n  (b) \nFigure 1.5: (a) The surge in unconventional oil and gas production has \n\nimplications well beyond United States, WEO-2012.

For example, if we consider the size order of \nhydrocarbon molecules (ranging from 0.01 ?m for asphaltenes to \n0.00038 ?m for methane) and compare it to the pore-throat sizes found \nin different reservoir rocks: \n\n- conventional reservoir rocks:  generally greater than 2 ?m; \n- tight gas sandstones: from about 2 to 0.03 ?m; \n- shale: from 0.1 to 0.005 ?m (NELSON, 2009); \n- seal (cap) rocks: from 0.1 to 0.002 ?m (SCHMITT et al., 2013). \n\nOne can see that even being comprised of a fine-grained pore-structure, \nboth tight gas sandstones (TGS) and shale might have stored \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n8              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nconsiderably amount of hydrocarbon (mainly gases) in their structure; \nthe recovery process, though, particularly for shale needs to be \nstimulated by the usage of specific methods such as hydraulic fracturing. \nOn the other hand in seal rocks the pore geometries and sizes need to be \nformerly settled to impede the escape of hydrocarbons from the \nreservoir rock, assuring a successful recovery in conventional reservoirs. \nOnly by understanding the structure of pore networks can engineers and \ngeologists make more accurate predictions of producible gas/oil and \noptimize its extraction (BUTCHER and LEMMENS, 2011). \n Currently, significant research effort in oil and gas field \nreservoirs are focused on pore-scale petrophysics, grain distribution, \npore geometry and distribution besides the fluid flow circulation. \nTextural and structural facies analysis also provided an important \npotential database for the assessment of parameters controlling the \nreservoir quality (BENZAGOUTA, 2012). In the present work a textural \nand morphological pore structure evaluation is done for the low \npermeability reservoir rocks: tight gas sandstones and seal rocks.  \n The seal rocks\u2019 investigation will help in judging the sealing \nefficiency of these rocks once that for the conventional reservoirs \nexploration higher pressures have been applied every day. Additionally \nit will give incites to the shale rocks characterization considering the \nsimilarity between the microstructure of both rocks. Therefore three seal \nrocks originated from distinct geological oil/gas fields were investigated \nby Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (PAS) procedure to determine the \nthermal diffusivity and porosity. The results were compared with \ntextural and mineralogical information obtained by Field Emission \nScanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) \ntechniques. Tight gas sandstones from dissimilar gas fields had \npetrophysical properties and pore structure parameters characterized by \nusage of Nitrogen Gas Adsorption (N2GA), Mercury Intrusion Capillary \nPressure (MICP), Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LFNMR), \nX-ray Nano and Micro Computed Tomography (NanoCT and \nMicroCT), Pulse-Decay Permeability (PDP), FESEM and XRD \ntechniques. After performing and optimizing a single-phase gas flow \npermeability characterization using the pulse-decay permeability (based \nin the transient method), we could compare the predicted permeability \nvalues to the obtained PDP experimental data. For the prediction of \npermeability distinct models were applied having as input data the pore \nstructure parameters measured in this work by the set of techniques.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             9 \n\n1.3. Objectives \n The main objective is to develop and apply a compendium3 of \ntechniques for the pore structure characterization in low permeability \nreservoir rocks since the desire to acquire understanding of these rocks \nhas become a wide tendency in the petroleum industry in Brazil and \nelsewhere. Thereby we divided this thesis in two main topics of \ninterested to accurately evaluate the analyzed rocks: \n\n- Characterization of petrophysical properties and pore \nstructure morphology on very low permeability tight gas \nsandstones using  distinct methodologies and techniques; \n\n- Usage of the Photoacoustic Spectroscopy technique to \ndetermine the thermal diffusivity and porosity in seal rocks \n(overlaying conventional reservoirs) as a key issue for safe \nexploration, storage purposes (CO2 sequestration) and \ndevelopments in shale characterization (also a very fine \nlayered porous media and comprised by distinct clays). \n\n1.3.1.

LITERATURE REVIEW  \n\n2.1. Hydrocarbon generation and migration \n Hydrocarbon generation is the natural result of the maturation of \nburied organic matter. This organic matter (organic carbon) very often \nconsists of microalgae and microorganisms which are deposited in \naquatic environments, especially on the sea bed. Lagoons and restricted \nseas are favorable for high preservation of organic matter. During \ndeposition and at the onset of burial of these sediments, most of the \nmaterials are dissolved, particularly by oxidation. The remaining part \ncontains kerogen which, due to the gradual burial of the sediments \ncausing high compression and a sharp rise in temperatures (for very long \ntime intervals), is transformed into hydrocarbons by thermal cracking \n(COSS\u00c9, 1993). \n Kerogen consists of very large molecules and is a kind of \npolymer. When it has been exposed to sufficient time and temperature \nthese large molecules will crack into smaller molecules, mostly \npetroleum. When the temperature is about 100?C a long period of \ngeological time is required. In rapidly subsiding basins the exposure \ntime is shorter and oil generation may only start at about 140\u2013150?C \n(BJ\u00d8RLYKKE, 2010). Usually around 120\u2013150oC, the oil is cracked \nyielding first wet and then dry gas (TISSOT and WELTE, 1984; \nBJ\u00d8RLYKKE, 2010). The \u201coil window\u201d lies between two temperatures \nlevels. It usually corresponds to burial depths among 1 and 3.5 km. The \ndepth (temperature) range where oil is generated is called the \u201coil \nwindow\u201d. At higher temperatures oil will be altered into gas by cracking \n(BJ\u00d8RLYKKE, 2010). The general scheme of evolution of the organic \nfraction and the hydrocarbons produced is depicted in Figure 2.1 \n(TISSOT and WELTE, 1984) where it is possible to see that organic \nmatter undergoes changes in composition with increasing burial depth \nand temperature. The three steps in the transformation of organic matter \nto hydrocarbons are termed diagenesis, catagenesis, and metagenesis. \nPetroleum hydrocarbons exist as gaseous, liquid, and solid phases, \ndepending on temperature, pressure, burial time, and composition of the \nsystem. \n Petroleum migrates from low permeability source rocks into high \npermeability reservoir rocks from which the petroleum can be produced. \nThe main driving force for petroleum migration is buoyancy because it \nis less dense than water. The forces acting against migration are the \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             13 \n\ncapillary forces and the resistance to flow though rocks with low \npermeabilities. It is necessary to assume that oil is mostly transported as \na separate phase. In order to pass through the narrow passage between \npores (pore throat), the oil droplets must overcome the capillary forces. \nWhen the pores are sufficiently small in a fine-grained sediment, these \nforces will act as a barrier to further migration of oil. The small gas \nmolecules, however, can diffuse through extremely small pores and thus \nescape from shales which form tight seals for oil (BJ\u00d8RLYKKE, 2010) \n\n \nFigure 2.1: Scheme of the evolution of the organic fraction and the \n\nhydrocarbon produced (maturation of organic matter and generation of oil \nand gas) as a function of temperature and depth (TISSOT and WELTE, \n\n1984; BJ\u00d8RLYKKE, 2010). \n\n2.2. Related studies and characteristics of analyzed rocks \n\n2.2.1. Tight gas sandstones \n\n A tight gas sandstone (TGS) reservoir is generally characterized \nas a formation with effective permeability less than 0.1 mD (LAW and \nCURTIS, 2002). Unique characteristics make this reservoir poor \nconductor of fluids (BLASINGAME, 2008): \n\n- Low permeability \u2013 which yields poor utilization of reservoir \npressure, caused in part by depositional (very small grains, \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n14              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nmixed with detrital clays) and diagenetic (clay precipitation, \nmassive cementation, pressure compaction, etc) issues. \n\n- Reservoir heterogeneity \u2013 which is dictated by deposition and \npost-deposition (diagenetic) events including vertical \nheterogeneity (layering, laminate, etc), lateral heterogeneity \n(medium to large scale geologic features, e.g., turbidite \ndeposition, faults, etc) and differential diagenesis \n(hydrocarbon generation and migration). \n\n As a result of storage and flow characteristics that are intimately \ntied to depositional and diagenetic processes in TGS, exploitation of this \nresource requires a comprehensive reservoir description and \ncharacterization program to identify properties which control \nproduction. In particular, TGS reservoirs have significant primary and \nsecondary porosity4 and pore connectivities dominated by clays and \nslot-like pores. This makes these reservoirs particularly susceptible to \nthe effects of overburden stress and variable water saturation (GOLAB \net al., 2010). Figure 2.2 illustrates the main differences in conventional \nsandstone, near tight and tight gas sandstone reservoirs, according to \nRezaee et al. (2012). As one can see important morphological and \ntextural attributes in the reservoirs (grain size, sorting, packing, shape, \npore heterogeneities and connected pore orientation) are distinguished. \nFor TGS reservoir the grains in the matrix are much more compacted \nand also relative high amount of clay is found in the pore walls.  \n Since the 1970\u00b4s when tight gas sandstones reservoirs were \ndefined as being the one in which the expected value of permeability to \ngas flow would be less than 0.1 mD, various studies have being focus in \nthe optimization of developments in these resources (HOLDITH, 2006; \nNELSON, 2009). Rushing et al. (2008) presented a work-flow to \ndescribe and characterize tight gas sands making reference to distinct \nmethods applied in works at the literature. Clarkson et al. (2011) \nmeasured small-angle and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering (SANS \n                                                        \n4 Primary porosity is the porosity preserved from deposition through \nlithification; secondary porosity is the porosity created through alteration of \nrock, commonly by processes such as dolomitization, dissolution and \nfracturing. This type of reservoirs are also called dual-porosity reservoir, a \nrock characterized in which all flow to the well effectively occurs in one \nporosity system, and most of the fluid is stored in the other. These \nreservoirs are layered with extreme contrasts between high-permeability and \nlow-permeability layers (OILFIELD GLOSSARY). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             15 \n\nand USANS) on tight gas reservoir samples from Western Canada in \norder to determine the applicability of these techniques for \ncharacterizing the full pore size spectrum and to gain insight into the \nnature of the pore structure and its control on permeability. They used \nN2 and CO2 adsorption to interpret the total porosity distribution \nobtained. Desbois et al. (2011) shown in that the imaging of pore space \nat scales below 1 ?m in tight gas sands remains difficult due to limits in \nresolution and sample preparation, so they explored the use of high \nresolution SEM in combination with argon ion beam cross sectioning \n(BIB, Broad Ion Beam) to prepare smooth, and damage-free, true-2D \nsurfaces of TGS, to image porosity down to 10 nm. They evaluated \ntextures and porosity though no other properties quantifications were \nperformed. \n\n \nFigure 2.2: Conventional, near tight and tight gas sandstone micrographs \n\nshowing the differences between pore connection (REZAEE et al., \n2012).Images on fractured (above) and polished (below) samples acquired \n\nrespectively by SEM and Optical Microscopy.  \n\n   However, using distinct methods and techniques to obtain and \ncompare pore structure parameters in tight gas sandstones is kind new \nproceeding. Also the obtained parameters were used in empirical \npermeability models and compared with experimental pulse-decay \nmeasurements. The low-permeabilities (and porosities) associated with \ntight gas sands can be attributed directly to a large distribution of small \nto very small pores and/or a very tortuous system of pore throats \nconnecting those pores (RUSHING et al., 2008). These are some of the \npore system parameters that can be used to predict empirical \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n16              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\npermeability. An understanding of the rock\u2019s pore structure, \nmineralogical composition and petrophysical properties using a \ncompendium of techniques will help to judge the exploration potential \nas hydrocarbons reservoirs in the analyzed TGS and also permit the \nestimation of permeability values using distinct methods.  \n \n\n2.2.2. Seal rocks \n\n Seal rocks are geological formations with extremely low porosity \nand permeability overlying oil or gas reservoirs, which constitute a \nbarrier against the volumetric flow of hydrocarbons into the upper \nlayers. Although a seal rock can be considered as a seal to hydrocarbons, \nit is erroneous to regard it as a completely impermeable layer (LI et al., \n2005). Seal rock, also called cap rock, is a crucial and sometimes \noverlooked factor in the evaluation of a potential hydrocarbon \naccumulation. Together with source rocks, reservoir rocks and \noverburden rocks, they represent one of the four essential elements of \npetroleum systems (HAO et al., 2000). \n The retention of hydrocarbons by overlying seals is controlled by \nthe capillary entry pressure, the permeability and the extent of diffusive \nlosses (molecular transport) through the fluid-saturated pore space \n(SCHL\u00d6MER and KROOSS, 1997). Today, data on the porosity and \nthermal diffusion of seal rock can find wide usage in the context of \npetroleum and gas exploration and also in the storage of anthropogenic \nCO2 in the subsurface region, e.g. saline aquifers or exploited gas \nreservoirs, e.g. cap rocks are formed in the process of sedimentary rock \naccumulation and so the physical and chemical parameters of these \nrocks change under the influence of lithogenic processes. In general, the \nmicrostructure of cap rocks is highly complex and anisotropic and \ncontains very small-diameter pores (in the order of Angstroms) and \nconsiderable presence of clays. Therefore, similarly to the \nmicrostructure of shale from the unconventional reservoirs, seal rock \nmorphology is difficult to characterize, making it necessary to use and \ndevelopment of distinct methods. Figure 2.3 compares the \nmicrostructure of a seal rock (a) and a shale (b), where one can observe \nits complexity and presence of small pore sizes for both rocks. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             17 \n\n (a) \n\n (b) \nFigure 2.3: (a) Seal rock originating from a Brazilian field (SCHMITT et \nal., 2013); (b) Shale showed in (CSIRO) with a complex microstructure. \n\n  The precise and accurate knowledge of transport properties of \nrocks and soils are extremely important for investigating the heat flow \nprocesses in geothermal phenomena and for petrophysical studies of \ngeological materials. The determination of such properties has become \nimportant with the widespread interest in the formation and evolution of \nhydrocarbon resources, with the subsequent extraction of oil and gas. \nThe thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity depend upon many \nfactors such as the thermal parameters of constituent phases, their \ncorresponding volume fraction, the contact areas, the shape of particles \nand the type of packing. The porosity of the materials plays also an \nimportant role among the many factors that influence thermal \nparameters (GUIMAR\u00c1ES et al, 2013). The most relevant thermal \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n18              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nparameters of rocks are thermal conductivity, specific heat and thermal \ndiffusivity (FENG et al., 2013; RUBIO, 2013), and these parameters are \nrelated to the pore structure. The evaluation of seal rocks using the open \nphotoacoustic cell (OPC) technique is an accurate and reliable method to \ninvestigate the thermal diffusivity and in our knowledge not yet done in \nthe literature for these rocks, especially when it goes into the topic of \ncorrelating obtained values of thermal diffusivity to predict porosity. It \nrequires a simple experimental setup, few analytical equations to be \nadjusted to the results besides very small quantities of the material to be \nanalyzed. Herein we show to be possible from a same experiment to \nobtain the thermal diffusivity and calculate the porosity in very low-\npermeability rocks such as seal rocks from conventional reservoir. \n\n2.3. Insights about reservoir rocks characterization \n Two basic sources of data for reservoir characterization are from \nspecific reservoir data and information from analogous reservoirs \n(JACKSON et al., 1993). Reservoir data (on a range of scales from \nbasin to field-scale information, km, to pore size information, \nAngstrons) can be broadly divided into three categories: (i) rock \nproperties (the container), (ii) fluid properties (the contents), and (iii) \nrock/fluid interactions. Imbibition is fundamental to oil and gas recovery \nfrom reservoirs under most secondary and improved recovery processes \nof practical interest. It is also dependent of porous medium wettability. \nThe rate and the extent of imbibition depend critically on the viscosity \nof the wetting and nonwetting phases (KOVSCEK et al., 2001). \n Microscopic (pore-scale) information that affects fluid flow in \nreservoir rocks includes mainly the surface roughness, grain size, sorting \nmineralogy, clay content, pore and throat dimensions, geometry, size, \ndistribution and connectivity. The major controls on these features are \nthe sediment source (provenance) and the subsequent diagenetic \nprocesses of compaction, cementation, and dissolution (JACKSON et \nal., 1993). An attempt to correlate pore structure information to \npetrophysical rock properties such as effective porosity and absolute \npermeability is desired in the reservoir characterization. Petrophysics is \nthe study of the physical properties of rocks. For a rock to form a \nreservoir (COSS\u00c9, 1993): \n\n(a) It must have a certain storage capacity: this property is \ncharacterized by the porosity; \n\n(b) The fluids must be able to flow in the rock: this property is \ncharacterized by the permeability; \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             19 \n\n(c) It must contain a sufficient quantity and concentration of \nhydrocarbons: the impregnated volume and saturations are \nfactors here.   \n\nMeasurements of petrophysical properties in core samples can be \nobtained by various techniques such as injection/extraction flow fluids \nor image analysis. In this sub-chapter we describe briefly notions about \nporous media properties and fluid behaviors used in the thesis.   \n2.3.1. Porosity and pore size distribution \n\n Porosity, which is a measure of the rock's storage capacity, is \naffected not only by the primary depositional processes but also by all \nsubsequent diagenetic processes (RUSHING et al., 2008). In a rock \nsample its apparent volume, or total volume (VT), consists of a solid \nvolume VS and a pore volume VP, where the porosity (in %) is defined \n(COSS\u00c9, 1993): \n\n( )\n.\n\n( )\nT SP P\n\nT S P T\n\nV VV V\nV V V V\n\n?\n?\n\n= = =\n+\n\n (2.1) \n\n The porosity of interest to the petroleum engineering, that which \nallows the fluids in the pores to circulate, is the effective porosity ?E, \nwhich corresponds to the pores connected to each other and to other \nformations (COSS\u00c9, 1993). Therefore the total porosity ?T, \ncorresponding to all the pores in an analyzed sample, is defined, whether \ninterconnected or not: \n\n,T E R? ? ?= +  (2.2) \nwhere ?R is the residual porosity which only takes account of isolated \npores. Effective porosity is often slightly less than total porosity. \nHowever, effective porosity in tight gas sandstones is typically much \nlower than the total porosity because of diagenesis. The type and \nmagnitude of diagenesis governs the connectivity of the primary \nporosity. Unlike conventional sandstone reservoirs that are characterized \nmostly by a primary intergranular porous system, TGS may exhibit \nseveral other types of porosity - including both primary and secondary \ninter-granular porosity, detrital matrix porosity, micro-porosity, and \ngrain fracture porosity (RUSHING et al., 2008). \n The effective porosity of rocks varies between less than 1% and \nover 40%. It is often stated that the porosity is (COSS\u00c9, 1993): \n\n- Low if ? &lt;5%; \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n20              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n- Mediocre if 5 &lt;? &lt;10%; \n- Average if 10% &lt;? &lt;20%; \n- Good if 20% &lt;? &lt;30%; \n- Excellent if ? > 30%. \n\n2.3.1.1. Classification of microporosity  \n\n Distinct spectrums of pore size distributions (PSD) can be \nobserved in the various reservoirs rocks. These spectrums of pore types \nalso capture some important petrophysical properties of the pores, so in \npetroleum engineering a pore classification based on the PSD spectrum \nis useful, though varying definitions exist in the literature (CANTRELL \nand HAGERTY, 1999; HILDENBRAND et al., 2005). This is \nexacerbated by the fact that geologists, petrophysicists and engineers \noften have their own definitions. Furthermore, the precise definition \noften depends on the method of observation (BARNETT et al., 2010). \nAs presented by LOUCKS et al. (2012) in a study on pore types and \nnetworks applied to mudrocks (also fine-grained as TGS and seal rocks), \nthe pore-size terminology of the International Union of Pure and \nApplied Chemistry (IUPAC) moreover defined by Rouquerol et al. \n(1994), might be more appropriate. In this terminology: \n\n- micropores have widths less than 2 nm; \n- mesopores have widths between 2 and 50 nm, and \n- macropores have widths greater than 50 nm.  \n\nLOUCKS et al. (2012) considered that in this classification, nearly all \nmudrock pores would be grouped with larger pores in carbonates and \nsandstones as macropores (see Figure 2.4, B). Although the pore-size \nclassification of ROUQUEROL et al. (1994) may be appropriate for \nchemical membranes, other controlled syntactic materials or even in seal \nrocks (SCHMITT et al., 2013) it is insufficient for most of the reservoir \nsystems comprised by a wide pore spectrum and main average pore \nsizes in the micrometer order. Another useful pore classification for \ncarbonate rocks was proposed by CHOQUETTE and PRAY (1970), \nwithin which they provided size modifiers (LOUCKS et al., 2012). They \ndefined micropores as being less than 62.5 ?m, mesopores as being \nbetween 62.5 ?m and 4 mm, and megapores as being between 4 and 256 \nmm. These authors included no subdivisions of pores smaller than 62.5 \n?m, see \u201cA\u201d in Figure 2.4.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             21 \n\n \nFigure 2.4: Pore sizes classification according distinct authors: (A) \n\nCOQUETTE and PRAY (1970), (B) IUPAC, (C) AHR et al., (2005), (D) \nCLERKE et al. (2008) and (E) published geological descriptions. \n\n According to Barnett et al. (2010), see \u201cC\u201d, \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d in \nFigure 2.4, distinct authors also have recently defined micropososity \nbased on their method of observation. For example, AHR et al., 2005 \n(C) defines micropores as those pores with pore throat diameters ? 0.5 \n?m and usually containing mostly irreducible water and little \nhydrocarbon; CLERKE et al. (D) propose an alternative scheme \nrecognizing three types of microporosity based on pore throat size. This \nclassification is useful recognizing that a spectrum of microporosity \nexists based on pore throat diameter from that which is effectively tight \n(Types II and III) to that which can store and flow hydrocarbons (type \nI); these three types are also in agreement with the SOEDER and \nCHOWDIAH (1990) classification for tight gas sandstones. Lastly, (E) \nis a proposed scheme based on published geological descriptions of \nmicroporosity (BARNETT et al., 2010). In our work only when the \nnitrogen gas adsorption experiments were performed the IUPAC \nclassification was assumed; for all other discussions we referred to \nmicroporosity as described in \u201cD\u201d Figure 2.4.  \n Understanding the abundance, distribution, and spatial \ninterrelationships of each pore type is important because each type may \ncontribute differently to permeability (LOUCKS et al., 2012). To \naddress the questions of pore size distribution in TGS we performed and \ncompared distinct techniques and methodologies: N2GA and MICP \ncombination, Low Field NMR and Multi-scale 3D X-Ray Tomography.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n22              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nThe pore connectivity, tortuosity and shape factors (also important \nparameters in the permeability prediction), pore aspect ratio, pore \npreferential orientations were measured by usage of X-ray nano- and \nmicroCT techniques. \n2.3.2. Specific surface area \n\n Specific surface area is another significant petrophysical \nparameter for understanding the physics of rocks\u2019 porous media and for \npermeability prediction (HOSSAIN et al., 2011). It is well known in the \nliterature that the BET method allows the estimation of specific surface \nareas from nitrogen adsorption isotherms on the basis of the multilayer \nadsorption model. The surface area (S) of a solid material is the \ncontribution of internal pore boundary area and external sample surface. \nWhen a material has considerable pore boundary (high porosity or for \nlow porosity reservoir clay bearing the pore walls) the fraction of \nexternal surface area is irrelevant. Therefore, S is closely related to the \nsize and volume of pores present in a material being larger as the pores \nget bigger in volume and smaller in size. \n The specific surface area (So) of a material can be defined as the \ntotal pore surface area divided by the total volume of solid material (Vs) \ncomprised in one analyzed sample (in m-1) or, divided by the sample \nmass (in m2/g), respectively: \n\n,o\ns\n\nS\nS\n\nV\n=  (2.3) \n\n.o\nS\n\nS\nS\n\nw\n=  (2.4) \n\nSome rocks having extremely small pore sizes show high values of So. In \nshale gas systems (as well seal rocks), nanopores play an important role \nwhere for the same pore volume, the exposed surface area in nanopores \nis larger than in micropores. This is because surface area is proportional \nto 4/d, where d is the pore diameter (JAVADPOUR et al., 2007).  \n In this context the So results of different methods reflect the \ndifferent properties of pores at different scales. By using a high \nresolution BET (which will be explained later) or a highly smoothed \nsurface derived from image analysis, from which usually a much smaller \nvalue of So is derived (HOSSAIN et al., 2011) and the value is related to \nthe used resolution, the values of So can varying in several orders of \nmagnitude. In image analysis the most widely method used to calculate \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             23 \n\nsurface area from image analysis is to have an equivalent diameter \n(usually spherical or cylindrical) calculated from the 3D pixel volume \nobjects (segmented pores). So considering the object shape as a sphere, \nthe volume-equivalent diameter (Dvolume = diameter of a sphere with the \nsame volume as the 3D object) is: \n\n1\n36\n.volume objectD V?\n\n? ?= ? ?\n? ?\n\n (2.5) \n\nIn the same way the surface-equivalent sphere diameter (Dsurface = \ndiameter of a sphere with the same surface as the object Sobject) is: \n\n1\n26\n.surface objectD S?\n\n? ?= ? ?\n? ?\n\n (2.6) \n\nHaving the sample volume from analyzed 3D images it is possible to \ncalculate the values of specific surface area.   \n In the present work So determination is done by N2GA and X-ray \nNano- and MicroCT techniques. For N2GA BET method is applied \nwhile for Nano- and MicroCT each obtained resolution is investigated \nusing Avizo Fire 7.1 Software on the segmented pore phase and C3DE \nprogram in the generated equivalent resistor pore network.  \n2.3.3. Pore morphological parameter: tortuosity \n\n The ability of a rock to store and flow fluids is dependent upon \nthe pore volume, pore geometry and its connectivity (KNACKSTEDT et \nal, 2006). Tortuosity is one of the most widely studied petrophysical \nparameters yet it is not very well understood (CLENNELL, 1997; \nZIARANI and AGUILERA, 2012). Introduced by CARMAN (1937), \ntortuosity accounts for the sinusoidal flow path through a porous \nmedium. It is defined as the ratio of effective flow (le) path to the \nmacroscopic length of sample (l) having any shape (most are core or \nplug): \n\n.e\nl\nl\n\n? =  (2.7) \n\n In his work CARMAN (1937) points out that tortuosity affects \nboth permeability and the leakage velocity by a factor of (le/l). \nTherefore, further work proposed that the overall factor by which the \nflow is retarded in a tortuous path is proportional to the square of \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n24              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\ntortuosity, which is referred to as the hydraulic \u201ctortuosity factor\u201d \n(DULLIEN, 1992; CLENNELL, 1997): \n\n2\n2 .e\n\nl\nT\n\nl\n?? ?= =? ?\n\n? ?\n (2.8) \n\n The tortuosity factor (T) is not a true pore structure parameter, but \nrather a parameter associated with one-dimensional models of pore \nstructure. Notwithstanding this, the tortuosity of a porous medium is a \nfundamental property of the streamlines, or lines of flux, in the \nconducting capillaries. It measures the deviation from the macroscopic \nflow direction of the fluid at every point (DULLIEN, 1992). Already \nBEAR and BACHMAT (1966) suggested in their porous medium model \nthat the permeability of a porous medium is shown to depend on three \nelementary porous medium properties: porosity (?), average medium \nconductance ( B ) and the medium\u00b4s tortuosity (?) (BEAR, 1972). B  is \nrelated to the cross-sections of the elementary channels through which \nthe flow takes place. One should recall that the discussion at this point is \nrestricted to the case of laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a porous \nmedium, visualized as a network of narrow channels through which \nflow takes place. Figure 2.5 shows a bundle of parallel channels with the \nsame diameter (a), with non-uniform diameters (b) and channels with a \nratio of the length of the flow to the length of the porous medium bigger \nthan one, i.e. the tortuosity. Figure 2.6 illustrates a sedimentary rock and \nthe increasing of tortuosity as the porosity between the sand grains more \ncompacted becomes smaller. Figure 2.7(a) compares the values of \ntortuosity for two distinct geometrical forms.  \n \n\n \nFigure 2.5: Capillary tube models (BEAR, 1972). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             25 \n\n \nFigure 2.6: Sedimentary rock according to (PAPE et al., 2006) showing \n\npore expansions with radii rsite and pore constrictions with radii rbond ? reff. \nAs an analogy (a) and (b) can exemplify a sandstone and a TGS  showing \n\nstages of compaction and increase of tortuosity. \n\n To calculate pore morphological parameters such as tortuosity, \nshape factor, aspect ratio and characteristic orientation, geometrical \nprocedures in the 3D images were calculated using Avizo Fire 7.1 \nsoftware. To exemplify, the definition taken by the program to calculate \ntortuosity consists of computing a path formed by centroids of each \nplanes of a binary 3D image along the Z-axis (Figure 2.7(b)). Tortuosity \nis the ratio of the length of a curve to the distance between its ends along \nZ-axis. In our case the distance between the ends of a curve is given by \nthe number of 2D acquired plans along the Z-axis.  \n\n          \nFigure 2.7: A vessel that bends gradually yields higher tortuosity \n\ncomparing to one that bends more frequently when the arc over chord \nlength.

Wettability and capillarity in porous media \n\n Oil recovery from low permeability reservoirs is strategically \nimportant because of the large resources locked in such formations. \nImbibition is fundamental to oil recovery from such reservoirs under \nmost secondary and improved recovery processes of practical interest. It \nis also characteristic of porous medium wettability. The rate and the \nextent of imbibition depend critically on the viscosity of the wetting and \nnonwetting phases (KOVSCEK et al., 2001).  \n Wettability is the term used to describe the relative adhesion of \ntwo fluids to a solid surface. In a porous medium containing two or \nmore immiscible fluids, wettability is a measure of the preferential \ntendency of one of the fluids to wet (spread or adhere to) the surface \n(TIAB and DONALDSON, 2004). The parameter that quantifies \nwettability is the contact angle created by the liquid and solid phases. A \nlower contact angle formed by the intersection of the solid-liquid \ninterface, ?SL, implies in a better wettability of the surface. Figure 2.8 \nshows distinct configurtions for a liquid in contact to a flat and \nhorizontal solid surface.  \n\n \n(a)                                                             (b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 2.8: Contact angles: (a) ?e > 90o showing the unfavorable surface \nwetting; (b) ?e = 0 showing the favorable surface wetting since the droplet \n\ncovers the completely surface; (c) general three-phase equilibrium \nconfiguration showing the interfacial tensions.    \n\nIn Figure 2.8 the situation (a) the contact angle is greater than 90\u00b0 \nindicating that the wetting of the surface is unfavorable so the fluid will \nminimize its contact with the surface and form a compact liquid drop. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             27 \n\nOn the other hand, situation (b) shows the fluid totally spreaded over the \nsolid surface area with the contact angle around zero (smaller than 90\u00b0) \nand so the wetting of the surface is favorable. Situation (c) illustrates the \n\u201cthreephase contact line\u201d where the solid, liquid and vapor phases co-\nexist. The static contact angle resulted through a force balance (therefore \nstationary) with respect to an solid surface at the contact line was fisrt \nestablished by Thomas Young in 1805. In this relationship the generated \ninterfacial surface tensions, ?, and the static contact angle ?e of a liquid \ndrop on an ideal solid surface was described as (YOUNG, 1805): \n\ncos ,SV SL\nLV\n\n? ?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=  (2.9) \n\nwhere the subscripts SV, SL and LV denote the solid-vapor, solid-liquid \nand liquid-vapor phases, respectively.  \n  The tendency for the drop to assume a curved interfacial shape to \nreach its equilibrium is due to its surface tension. As a consequence \nthere will be a pressure difference, capillary pressure, across the \ninterface with the highest pressure residing on the concave side. The \ncapillary pressure in descrived by the Laplace-Young equation, for a \nspherical drop or bubble, rp1 = rp2 = rp and hence (YEO, 2006): \n\n2 cos\n,nwnw w\n\np\n\nP P P\nr\n\n? ?\n? = ? =  (2.10) \n\nwhere Pnw and Pw are the pressures of nonwetting and wetting fluids in \nthe interface, e. i. inside and outside the drop or buble. A simple model \nexplaining what happens in the void space in a rock, is the capillary tube \n(simulating the narrow opening between grains) shown in Figure 2.9. In \nthe left side note the capillary rise for the liquid being the wetting phase \nwhile in the right side the pressure of wetting fluid (Pw) (in this case \ngas) just below the meniscus.

In a \n\u201ccapillary system\u201d the interfaces separating the various bulk phases play \na significant part in determining the physical-chemical state of the \nsystem. In these systems, mechanical equilibrium is determined not only \nby the hydrostatic pressure and gravitational attraction but also by forces \nassociated with surface tension (DULLIEN, 1992). \n In this chapter, the discussion is related to the capillary pressure \nand how this important parameter is applied to the characterization of \nporous media, such as tight gas sandstones and seal rocks, containing \ntwo or more fluids. The capillary pressure curves can be modeled \nintending to describe the pore structure as discussed next. \n\n2.3.4.1. Capillary mechanisms in heterogeneous reservoirs \n\n Capillary imbibition is the spontaneous displacement of a non-\nwetting fluid by a wetting fluid (e. g. oil by water) and it is a favorable \nmechanism for hydrocarbons recovery. If we consider a reservoir which \ntwo different porous media coexist (Figure 2.10, COSS\u00c9 (1993)): \n\n(i) A fractured reservoir (a); \n(ii) A stratified reservoir (b); \n(iii) A reservoir with average compact nodules (c), as shown below. \n\nIf we denote a permeable medium by \u201cP\u201d and one much less permeably \nby \u201cI\u201d we assume zone P has more large pores than zone I. \nConsequently we expect to have for the same saturation S1 a capillary \npressure PCI > PCP. When a fluid 1 is injected, it occupies the pores of \nhigher permeable medium rapidly, accordingly SWP > SWI at a given \ntime, see Figure 2.10(d).  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             29 \n\n \nFigure 2.10: Different porous media, a, b and c with the matrix in white. \nCapillary pressure curves for a more (P) and less (I) permeable media (d), \n\n(COSS\u00c9, 1993). \n\n In higher permeability zones in a reservoir, the saturation with \ndisplacing fluid SW thus reaches a value SWP, whereas in less permeable \nzones, it only has the value SWI. Yet an equilibrium of the capillary \npressures must be established between the two media present, at the \ncontact of the two zones; this occurs only if the fluid saturation in zone I \nrises, while it decreases in zone P until it corresponds to identical \npressures PCE, as displayed by the arrows in Figure 2.10(d). \n \u201cThus the low permeability medium tends to be imbibed with \nwetting fluid 1 (water), at the expense of the high permeability medium, \nand tends to flush the non-wetting fluid 2 (oil) into the high permeability \nmedium. This mechanism tends to increase the overall oil (fluid 2) \nrecovery rate\u201d. Compare (COSS\u00c9, 1993). In practice: \n\n- If the displacement is very rapid, the less permeable zones \ncan produce oil only through permeable zones already swept \nby a wetting fluid, where the relative permeability to oil is \nvery low; \n\n- If the displacement is slow, the less permeable zones will \nhave the time to produce more oil as the displacement front \nmoves forward. \n\nThereby identifying such permeable zones (also called \u201csweet spots\u201d) in \nunconventional reservoirs exploration is of extreme importance. One of \nthe methods applied to obtain the porosity and pore size distributions of \nTGS rocks originated from three distinct reservoirs (Field A, B and C), \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n30              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nwas the combination of N2GA and MICP techniques. From the obtained \nPSD curves we could evaluate the changes of porosity and main pore \nsizes within reservoir depth. \n\n2.4. Single-phase transport through porous media \n\n2.4.1. Permeability and reservoir engineering \n\n Permeability is a measure of the ability of fluid to flow within the \ninterconnected pore network of a porous medium. Reservoir flow rates, \nincluding oil production rates, are proportional to the permeability \nvalues of reservoir rock. On the other hand, rock permeability \ndetermines the pressure drop required to produce or inject fluid from an \nexisting reservoir at a desired rate (JACKSON et al., 1993). \n Permeability is a term used to express the conductivity of a \nporous medium with respect to permeation by a Newtonian fluid. The \nparameter that measures the contribution of the porous medium to the \nconductivity and is independent of both flow mechanisms and fluid \nproperties is denominated \u201cspecific permeability\u201d, k, onward in the \npresent work called \u201cpermeability\u201d. Its value depends uniquely by the \npore structure of the analyzed material. Usually darcy is the most used \nunit of permeability (DULLIEN, 1992). In the petroleum engineering \nhowever de unit milidardy = 0.001 darcy is used with 1mD equal to \n0.987 x 10-15m2. In this work, the studied unconventional reservoir rocks \nsuch as tight gas sandstones and shale, leads to the measurements of \npermeability even low, into the microdarcy (?D) range. \n Mathematical models of petroleum reservoirs have been utilized \nsince the late 1800s. In the simulation of flow in the reservoir, the \nmomentum equation is usually given in the form of Darcy\u2019s law (Darcy, \n1856). Derived empirically, this law indicates a linear relationship \nbetween the fluid velocity relative to the solid and the pressure head \ngradient. Darcy\u2019s empirical flow law was the first extension of the \nprinciples of classical fluid dynamics to the flow of fluids through \nporous media (DAKE, 1978). For the reservoirs petroleum engineering \nthe significance of Darcy\u2019s law is that it introduces flow rates into this \narea and, since the total surface oil production rate from a reservoir is: \n\ndt\ndN\n\nq pres =  (2.12) \n\nwith Np being the cumulative oil production, it implicitly introduces a \ntime scale in oil and gas recovery calculations. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             31 \n\n2.4.2. Darcy\u2019s law definition \n\n In 1856, by flowing water through a pack of sand, the French \nengineer Henry Darcy established that, for any flow rate, the velocity of \nflow was directly proportional to the difference in manometric heights, \nthe relationship being: \n\n1 2 ,\nh h h\n\nu K K\nl l\n? ?\n\n= =  (2.13) \n\nwhere u is the flow velocity, which is the total measured flow rate (q), \ndivided by the cross-sectional area of the sand pack; ?h is the difference \nin manometric leves, (water equivalent); l is the total length of the sand \npack, and, K is a constant. Subsequently Darcy\u2019s experimental law was \nrepeated by others and proved to be independent of the direction of flow \nin the Earth\u2019s gravitational field (DAKE, 1978).   \n \n\n   \n(a)                                                      (b) \n\nFigure 2.11: (a) Schematic of Darcy\u00b4s experimental apparatus; (b) \nOrientation of Darcy\u2019s apparatus with respect to the Earth\u00b4s gravitational \n\nfield (DAKE, 1978). \n\nAs shown in Figure 2.11 the pressure at any point in the flow path, \nwhich has an elevation, z, relative to the datum plane with respect to the \nprevailing atmospheric pressure, can be expressed in absolute units as: \n\n( ),p g h z?= ?  \n\nalternatively \n(2.14) \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n32              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n.\np\n\nhg gz\n?\n\n? ?\n= +? ?\n? ?\n\n \n\nIn this equation ? is the liquid (water in Darcy\u2019s experiment) density. \nNow, if equation (2.13) is written in differential form as: \n\n,\ndh\n\nu K\ndl\n\n=  (2.15) \n\n then differentiating equation (2.14) and substituting equation (2.15) \ngives: \n\n( )\n.\n\nK d p K d hg\nu gz\n\ng dl g dl?\n? ?\n\n= + =? ?\n? ?\n\n (2.16) \n\nThe constant (K/g) is only applicable for the flow of water, which was \nthe liquid used exclusively in Darcy\u2019s experiments.

The constant k is described as the permeability. \nIt is denominated the absolute permeability of analyzed material, \ncompletely saturated with a fluid and, because of the manner of \nderivation, will have the same value irrespective of the nature of the \nfluid (DAKE, 1978). \n The specific or absolute permeability (k) of a rock is the ability of \nthe rock to allow a fluid with which it is saturated to flow through its \npores. In the petroleum engineering, the derivation of Darcy\u2019s law as \nexposed in equation (2.18) is used to determine the flow through \npermeable media for a one-dimensional, homogeneous rock with a fluid \nof constant viscosity. Such situation is illustrated by Figure 2.12, where \na sample of length dl and cross-section A, saturated with a fluid of \ndynamic viscosity ?, and crossed horizontally by flow rate Q (measured \nin the condition of section dl) is considered. In steady-state conditions, \nthe upstream pressure is P1, and the downstream pressure is P2 = (P1-\ndP). The lateral sides are impervious to fluids. If the fluid does not react \nwith the rock, which is the general case, permeability is expressed like \nan area: \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             33 \n\nk dP\nQ A\n\ndl?\n=  (2.18) \n\n \nFigure 2.12: Sample of length dl and cross-section A, Darcy\u2019s law scheme. \n\n Darcy\u2019s law applies only to the cases where the interstitial flow \n(i.e., the flow through pores of a porous medium) may be modeled as \nStokes flow, ignoring the inertial term restricts the analysis to creeping \n(laminar) flow where viscous forces dominate in the flow regime. \nAccording to SCHEIDEGGER (1974), deviations of Darcy\u2019s law (non-\nlinearity between flow velocity and gradient) are: (1) non-Newtonian \nbehavior of the fluid itself; (2) particle migrations that cause blocking \nand unblocking of pores; (3) local consolidation and swelling of the soil; \n(4) molecular or ionic effects and (5) turbulent effects associated with \nhigh flow rates. \n2.4.3. Deviations from Darcy\u2019s law in low-permeability rocks \n\n In conventional gas reservoirs, Darcy flow is the dominant flow \ntransport mechanism; however, in some tight sands and particularly in \nshale sediments, where pore-throat radii as small as a few nanometers \nare common, diffusion plays an important role and it must be taken into \naccount (ZIARANI and AGUILERA, 2012). To describe how gas fluids \nare driven respectively by pressure gradient, concentration and surface \ntension, through a porous media, permeability, diffusion and adsorption \nare the main mechanisms used (HOU, 2012). Permeability is one of the \nmost fundamental properties of any reservoir rock required for modeling \nhydrocarbon production (SAKHAEE-POUR and BRYANT, 2012).  \n\n2.4.3.1. Knudsen number and flow regimes \n\n Knudsen number, a dimensionless parameter, is commonly used \nto classify flow regimes in small pores where deviation from continuum \nflow is important (ZIARANI and AGUILERA, 2012). It is defined as \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n34              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nthe ratio of molecular mean free path, ? (nm), and a characteristic \nlength, such as pore radius, r (nm), and is given by: \n\nKn\nr\n?\n\n=  (2.19) \n\n According to ZIARANI and AGUILERA (2012) an accurate \ndescription of gas flow through porous media must include both \ndiffusion and viscous flow. The authors say that bulk diffusion, \nKnudsen\u2019s diffusion, and surface diffusion are the various forms of \ndiffusion flow. As illustrated in Figure 2.13, in large pores, with \ndiameter much larger than mean free path of gas molecules (r >> ?), \ninteraction between gas molecules is more frequent than collision of gas \nmolecules with pore surface (walls). This is simply called bulk \ndiffusion. Therefore, in large pores, viscous flow and bulk diffusion are \nthe dominant transport mechanisms (situation a); as the pore diameter \ndecreases or molecular mean free path increases (at lower pressures), the \ngas molecules tend to collide more with pore surface than other gas \nmolecules. This means that a point is reached in which the gas \nmolecules move almost independently from one another. This is called \nKnudsen\u2019s diffusion (situation b). In pores with much smaller diameters \n(situation c) or stronger surface forces, molecules are adsorbed on the \nsurface of the pore; as a result surface diffusion occurs. \n\n \nFigure 2.13: Schematic of a cross-section of a pore and gas molecules \nillustrating types of diffusion flow: (a) Bulk diffusion, (b) Knudsen\u2019s \n\ndiffusion, and (c) surface diffusion. In a real pore situation all three types of \ndiffusion can co-exist (ZIARANI and AGUILERA, 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             35 \n\n With the advent of tight and shale gas reservoirs playing \nsignificant importance in today\u2019s energy market, the slippage gas flow \nregime in fine-grained rocks have been discussed by various researches \n(JAVADPOUR, 2009; CIVAN, 2010; DARABI, et al., 2012; ZIARANI \nand AGUILERA, 2012). In this context gas flow that considers     \nslippage phenomenon date started to be developed more than a century \nago with the works of MAXWELL (1867), KNUDSEN (1909) and \nKLINKENBERG (1941). Table 2.1 summarizes the flow regime \nclassification proposed and discussed nowadays, related to the \nrespective Knudsen number and models to be applied. In the present \nwork we investigate the gas flow in TGS rocks (also having pores in the \nnanometers order) using the Pulse-Decay Permeability (PDP) technique \nand assuming Darcy permeability. Sensitivity analyses to describe the \neffect of pore size, pressure and temperature on gas flow, performed \nduring the testes, are presented. Thereby the contribution of Knudsen \ndiffusion and Klinkenberg slip flow on total flow are also discussed. \n \n\nTable 2.1: Models and flow regimes classification for porous media \n(ZIARANI and AGUILERA, 2012). \n\nContinuum \n(Darcy/Viscous) \n\nflow\nKn &lt;0.001\n\nDarcy\u2019s equation for \nlaminar flow and \n\nForchheimer\u2019s equation \nfor turbulent flow\n\nAssumes immobile fluid at the pore \nwall.

Klinkenberg corrections \n\n The empirical Klinkenberg model (KLINKENBERG, 1941) \naccounts for gas slip flow in tight porous media. As previously \ndiscussed in this work, Darcy's law is based on the assumption that the \nflow is governed by the viscosity (condition of Poiseuille flow). In this \nflow only collisions between molecules occurs which are represented by \nthe notion of viscosity. However, when the pore size present in the \nporous medium is so small compared to the mean free path of the fluid \nmolecules, this is the case of low pressure gradient or very small pores. \nFor this type of flow, called Knudsen flow, there are no collisions \nbetween molecules but only between solid walls and molecules \n(KNUDSEN, 1950) and so, there is still proportionality between flow \nrate and pressure drop, but the coefficient is not related to viscosity \nanymore. However, gas slippage in porous media and its effect on \npermeability was first addressed by (KLINKENBERG, 1941). In his \npioneering study, Klinkenberg showed how the slip of gas molecules at \nthe surface of rock can influence permeability and proposed an equation \nin which permeability is related to the inverse of pressure (ZIARANI \nand AGUILERA, 2012). In this matter a correction can be applied to \nDarcy's law to account for the deviation from the Poiseuille's law \naccording to (KLINKENBERG, 1941): \n\n1 ,ka\nb\n\nk k\nP?\n\n? ?\n= +? ?\n\n? ?\n (2.20) \n\nwhere k? is the absolute permeability at a very high gas-phase pressure \nat which condition the Klinkenberg\u2019s slippage effect can be negligible \n(WU, et al., 1998). ka is the apparent (measured) gas permeability, P is \nthe average pore pressure and bk is the Klinkenberg\u2019s slippage factor \nwhich depends on the gas and the properties of the analyzed material: \ngas molecular mean free path (?), material pore-throat radius (r), and \ngas pressure (P) as depicted on (KLINKENBERG, 1941): \n\n4\n,k\n\nb c\nP r\n\n?\n=  (2.21) \n\nwhere bk and P are in psi, ? and r, are in nm, and c ? 1. \nAlso other authors have been proposed correlations for factor b in \nexperimental permeability measurements as shown in Table 2.2. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             37 \n\nTable 2.2: Corrections for factor b in permeability measurements. \n\nModel Correlation Units and comments \n\nKlinkenberg \n(1941) \n\n4 /kb c P r?=  \nc is a constant close to \n\nunity \n\nFlorence et al., \n(2007) \n\n0.5( / )kb k? ?\n?\n\n?=  \n?-value \n\nNitrogen = 43.345 \nAir = 44.106 \n\nCivan (2010) 0.50.0094( / )kb k ?\n?\n\n?  \nCorrelation for \n\nnitrogen.

(fraction). \n \n\n According to KLINKENBERG (1941), the apparent permeability \nof a porous medium to gas changes with gas pressure, becoming lower \nas the mean pressure increases. As the mean pressure becomes \nincreasingly high, the apparent permeability approaches a value, (k?), \nwhich has been shown to be equal to the permeability of the porous \nmedium to a nonreactive liquid. In an unsteady-state permeability \ndetermination, pressure in a core changes both with position (high at the \ninlet face to atmospheric pressure at the outlet face) and with time. Since \napparent permeability is a function of pressure, it too must change with \nboth position and time. The time required for any given pressure interval \nmeasured is roughly inversely proportional to the permeability of the \nanalyzed core (JONES, 1972).  \n\n2.4.3.3. Apparent permeability and correction factor definition \n\n Figure 2.14 shows the Klinkenberg\u2019s and Knudsen (CIVAN, \n2010) correction factors for distinct flow regimes. As one can see, \ncompared to the Knudsen\u2019s correction, Klinkenberg underestimates the \ncorrection factor particularly as it becomes larger than 1, besides no \nsignificant differences are observed. For slip flow regime, where 0.0001 \n<Kn &lt;0.1, the correction factor is very small (DARABI et al., 2012). \nWhen the Knudsen number increases (in the direction of transition and \nfree-molecule flows) the magnitude of the correction factor gets \nsubstantially large. However, such a high Knudsen\u2019s flow is not \ncommonly found at reservoir condition unless the formation is \nextremely tight as in the case of shale (JAVADPOUR, 2009; ZIARANI \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n38              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nand AGUILERA, 2012). As both the correction factor and Knudsen \nnumber are dimensionless, the graphic in Figure 2.14 can be used to \ngeneralize the permeability correction between the apparent and \nabsolute (here called Darcy) permeability. \n\n \nFigure 2.14: Knudsen\u2019s and Klinkenberg\u2019s correction factor versus \n\nKnudsen number for all transition flow regimes (modified from: ZIARANI \nand AGUILERA, 2012; DARABI, et al., 2012). \n\n2.4.3.4. Parameters of influence \n\n Pore-throat radius, pressure and temperature are the main \nparameters playing a role in the magnitude of Knudsen\u2019s correction \nfactor. The contribution of Klinkenberg effects and Knudsen diffusion \nto total gas flow is larger at lower pressures (JAVADPOUR, 2009). \nPressure and temperature affect the molecular mean free path and \nconsequently Knudsen number and Klinkenberg\u2019s correction factor. It \nhappens because molecular mean free path, defined as an average \ndistance traveled by molecules between collisions, is a function of \npressure, temperature and collision diameter of the molecules which can \nbe obtained from the following equation (CUSSLER, 1997): \n\n2\n( , ) ,\n\n2\nBK TP T\n\nP\n?\n\n?\n=  (2.22) \n\nwhere T is the temperature (K), P is the pressure (Pa), KB is the \nBoltzmann constant (1.3805 x 10-23 J/K), and ? is the gas collision \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             39 \n\ndiameter (m) equal to 0.44 for nitrogen and 0.42 for methane. In the \npresent work, the permeability experiments (PDP) were performed using \ngas nitrogen, at temperature of 22 oC and mainly at mean pressure of gas \nequal 6.89 MPa. In these condition the value of ? is equal 2.15 nm. \n\n2.5. Review of utilized permeability models \n Knowledge of pore space properties of sedimentary rocks is a \nprerequisite for the exploitation of hydrocarbon reservoirs (PAPE et al., \n2006). The rock permeability is one of most important properties \nconcerning the reservoir since it allows calculation of the fluid flow. \nPredicting permeability becomes much more difficult in formations with \nsmall grain size and an abundance of clay minerals such as tight gas \nsandstones rocks - a sub-millidarcy reservoir. The empirical relations \nused in this work to estimate permeability from measured pore structure \nparameters on TGS of field A are briefly discussed as follows.  \n2.5.1. Permeability correlation from capillary pressure curve \n\n The existing correlations from Winland-Pittman (KOLODZIE, \n1980), Aguilera (AGUILERA, 2002) and Katz-Thompson (KATZ and \nTHOMPSON, 1986) are permeability models based on the concept of \ncapillary pressure where a characteristic throat size governs the flow at \nthe percolation threshold of the porous medium. Thereby, each model \nuses a different method to estimate that characteristic throat size. \nWinland developed a power law model that relates permeability with \nporosity and pore throat radius (later published by KOLODZIE, 1980) \nusing data from more than 10 formations: \n\n1.470 1.701\n3517.6 ,k r?=  (2.23) \n\nwhere r35 is the pore radius corresponding to 35% mercury saturation.  \nAguilera (2002) also proposed a correlation for pore throat radius \nassuming 35% mercury saturation. To develop his correlation, Aguilera \nused over 2500 sandstone and carbonate samples from 28 formations: \n\n2.222\n35 11.324 ,k r ?=  (2.24) \n\nwith values of r35 given in ?m, k in mD, and ? is the fractional porosity. \nStarting from percolation concept, Katz and Thompson have related the \npermeability of a porous medium to a length scale lc: \n\n21\n,\n\n226\nclk\nF\n\n=  (2.25) \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n40              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nwhere lc is the size of the smallest throat invaded by a non-wetting phase \nat the percolation threshold. lc can be estimated from the inflection point \nof the mercury injection curve. F is the formation factor of a \nhomogeneus porous media related to the tortuosity (?) and already \ndemostrated by WYLLIE and SPANGLER in 1952 as being: \n\n1\n.mF\n\n?\n? ?\n\n= =  (2.26) \n\nIn the equation above m is the Archie\u2019s cementation factor which is a \nunique property of a given porous media. Ranges of 1.2 &lt;m &lt;3 have \nbeen presented by CLENNELL (1997). \n In this study, we apply all correlations discussed above to \nestimate the permeability using the parameters r35, lc and ? measured by \nthe combination of N2GA and MICP techniques. The tortuosity \nparameter obtained by X-ray CT technique allowed us to estimate the \nformation factor of analyzed samples and it is one important pore \nstructural parameter in the Kozeny-Carman model, also used to predict \npermeability. Measured pore structure parameters obtained by the \napplied techniques in the present work were correlated to empirical \nmodels to estimate or simulate permeability. \n2.5.2. Models used for fine-grained rocks \n\n The fluid transport in fine-grained porous rocks such as tight gas \nsandstones rocks can be described as Darcy flow/advection \n(HILDENBRAND et al., 2005; SCHL\u00d6MER and KROOSS, 1997). \nHowever, as noted by Civan et al. (2010) for shale gas, by Javadpour \n(2009) for nanopores mudrocks, by Rushing et al. (2008) for tight \nsandstones and previously in this work, gas flow is often affected by \nseveral phenomena, e.g. possible transition from volume flow to \nmolecular transport, which may cause deviations from Darcy\u2019s law. \nNevertheless, it remains the common base for several mathematical \nmodels to measure permeability in sandstones and most TGS. In \ngeneral, these models are correlated to physical parameters such as \ndensity, porosity, grain and pore diameter or specific surface area \n(YANG and APLIN, 2007). In the sub-chapter reported here after, the \nKozeny-Carman equation, Pape et al. (1999) pore fractal model and the \nSeries-Parallel model were used to estimate permeability coefficients \nfrom the measured physical parameters of the TGS rocks samples using \nN2GA and MICP in combination and X-ray CT, as described below. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             41 \n\n2.5.2.1. Kozeny-Carman model \n\n One of the most widely used expressions, the Kozeny-Carman \nlaw that relate permeability to the structural characteristics of the \nmedium have been derived analytically for capillary tube models \n(LATIEF and FAUZI, 2012). The Kozeny-Carman law expresses the \npermeability of the medium assumed to be equivalent to a conduit, the \ncross section of which has an extremely complicated shape but, on the \naverage a constant area (Dullien, 1992) it is therefore a function of pore \ngeometry. \n The general form for the Kozeny-Carman (KC) model can be \nsimplified as (DULLIEN, 1992): \n\n3\n\n2\n2 2\n\n,\n(1 )\n\nKC\ne\n\no o\n\nk\nl\n\nF S\nl\n\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n? ?? ? ?\n? ?\n\n \n(2.27) \n\nwhere ? is the porosity of the sample, Fo is a shape factor, le is the \naverage path length of flow and So is the specific surface area based on \nthe volume of the solid. The parameter (le/l) is the tourtuosity and (le/l)\n\n2 \nis the hydraulic \u201ctortuosity factor\u201d. The intrinsic permeability is given in \nm2, the porosity has no unit and the specific surface area multiplied by \ngrain density is given in m-1. \n\n2.5.2.2. Fractal permeability-porosity relationship (PAPE et al., 1999) \n\n The permeability-porosity relationship presented by PAPE et al. \n(1999) was demonstrated using several data sets of permeability and \nporosity measured on samples from different types of sandstones and \nshale. In this work they observed that different diagenetic processes may \nsuperpose each other as mechanical compaction, mineral solution, and \ncementation changing permeability-porosity relationships. They also \naffirmed that as long as the fractal dimension of the pore space equals \nthe standard value D=2.36, the diagenetic path is characterized by a \npower-law curve with an exponent of 10 in the porosity-permeability \nplot. However, conditions may be different in the low-permeability \nrange. Usually the decrease of the effective pore radius and the increase \nof the tortuosity (?) is less pronounced for low permeabilities, i.e., at \nlater stages of diagenesis. This is reflected by the smaller increase in \npermeability with porosity in the low-porosity range (for more details \nsee PAPE et al., 1999). Therefore to characterize samples with low \npermeability they proposed the following equation: \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n42              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n2 100.1 26 (10 ) ,PAPE SHALEk ? ? ?? = + +  (2.28) \nwhere porosity (?) is given in fraction volume. \n\n2.5.2.3. Series-Parallel model \n\n The Series-Parallel (S-P) equations emerged originally from the \nwork of Childs and Collis-George (1950) and Reznik (1971). Later \nFernandes et al. (2003) studying reservoirs rocks, applied this model \nconsidering the probability of pores being connected based on the \namount of pores. Also, the pore size distribution was obtained by 2D \nimage analysis. The authors concluded that the probability of pores \nbeing connected can be evaluated considering the amount of pores by \ncalculating the quotient between the number of pores in a certain class \nand the total number of pores present in the medium. Therefore, \ngeneralizing for n classes of pore size, the intrinsic permeability \nobtained applying the S-P procedure (kSP) is defined as: \n\n2\n\n1 1\n2 ,\n\n8\n\nn n\ni\n\nSP i i i j\ni j i\n\nr\nk P P P?\n\n= = +\n\n? ?\n= +? ?\n\n? ?\n? ?  (2.29) \n\nwhere ri and ?i are the pore radius and porosity in the i class, \nrespectively. \n Also, the probability of pores connecting (Pi), considering \ncylindrical pores of class i is given by \n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n.\n\ni\n\ni\ni\n\nn k\nk\n\nk\n\nr\nP\n\nr\n\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?=\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?\n\n?\n (2.30) \n\n The complete pore size distribution and porosity data obtained by \nN2GA and MICP combination were used as the input values for the S-P \nmodel, while BET specific surface area values were used in the K-C \nmodel.  \n2.5.3. Estimating permeability from NMR measurements \n\n The porosity and pore-size information from NMR measurements \ncan be used to estimate both the permeability and the potentially \nproducible porosity (that is, the movable fluids). The NMR estimate of \nproducible porosity is called the free-fluid index (FFI). The estimate of \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             43 \n\nFFI is based on the assumption that the producible fluids reside in large \npores, whereas the bound fluids reside in small pores. The spin\u2013spin \nrelaxation time obtained performing a NMR test is denominated (T2). T2 \nis one of the pore structural parameters determined in this thesis and it \nwill be explained in a later section. Because T2 values can be related to \npore sizes a T2 value can be selected below which the corresponding \nfluids are expected to reside in small pores and above which the \ncorresponding fluids are expected to reside in larger pores. Then this T2 \nvalue is called the T2 cutoff (MARSHALL et al., 1995; COATES et al., \n1999). \n Through the partitioning of the T2 distribution, T2 cutoff divides \neffective porosity of tight sandstones into FFI and bound-fluid porosity, \nor bulk volume irreducible (BVI). The T2 cutoff can be determined with \nNMR measurements on water-saturated core samples. Specifically, a \ncomparison is made between the T2 distribution of a sample in a fully \nwater-saturated state, and the same sample in a partially saturated state, \nthe latter typically being attained by centrifuging the core at a specified \nair-brine capillary pressure. Although capillary pressure, lithology, and \npore characteristics all affect T2 cutoff values, common practice establishes \nlocal field values. E.g. in the Gulf of Mexico T2 cutoff values of 33 and 92 \nms are generally appropriate for sandstones and carbonates (COATES, \net al., 1999). In the TGS rocks analyzed in the present work only \nmeasurements of 100% saturated on mini plugs were performed, \nsuggesting therefore the usage of theoretical values of 33 ms as T2 cutoff. \nHowever, Ashkar et al. (2010) studying sandstone ranging from tight \ngas to poorly lithified obtained T2cutoff values between 1.45 ms and 242 \nms where clay content played a key factor in reducing cutoff time.  \n NMR relaxation properties of rock samples are dependent on \nporosity, pore size, pore-fluid properties and mineralogy (COATES, et \nal., 1999). The NMR estimate of permeability is based on theoretical \nmodels that show that permeability increases with both increasing \nporosity and increasing pore size. Traditionally, two related kinds of \npermeability models have been developed: the free-fluid or Coates \nmodel (applicable in formations containing water and/or hydrocarbons); \nthe Mean-T2 model or SDR (applicable to the pore systems containing \nonly water) (MORRISS et al., 1997). The use of these particular size \nparameters in their respective expressions is based on empirical \nconsiderations. The Mean-T2 model, however, fails when the pore \ncontains hydrocarbons because then T2gm (with gm refering to the \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n44              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\ngeometric mean of the T2 distribution) is not controlled exclusively by \npore size. \n\n \nFigure 2.15: The Coates permeability model (top) uses the FFI/BVI ratio to \ndescribe changes in the surface-to-volume ratio. The Mean-T2 permeability \nmodel (bottom) uses an average T2 value to describe changes in surface-to-\n\nvolume ratio (COATES et al., 1999). \n\n From the Coates model, permeability is estimated by: \n22\n\nCoates\nFFI\n\nk\nC BVI\n?? ?? ? ? ?\n\n= ? ?? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ?? ?? ?\n\n (2.31) \n\nwhere porosity,?, is given in percentage, C is a constant which is a term \nthat reflects the correlation between the rock's pore throat and pore size \nand in fact it is a function of pore geometry dependent on the processes \nthat created the formation. In sandstones C is usually around 10. FFI is \nthe free fluid index, and BVI is the bound volume of irreducible water. \nCore porosity and permeability should be used to estimate C for the \nCoates model. In this work we found a mean C value for the well A \nformation based on the obtained T2cutoff values. \n The Mean-T2 model, also called SDR (Schlumberger Doll \nResearch) is a similar expression to 2 41k T ?=  which has been used to \nestimate matrix permeability in sandstones (LATORRACA et al., 1993) \nand given by (MORRISS et al., 1997): \n\n2 4\n2 2Mean T gmk bT ?? =  (2.32) \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             45 \n\nApplying this equation with porosity as a decimal fraction and T2gm in \nms gives permeability estimates in mD. T2gm is the geometric mean of \nthe T2 distribution and b is a coefficient that depends on the formation \ntype and can be determined through calibration with core porosity and \npermeability. Rezaee et al. (2012) used b equal to 4 for sandstones; \nMorriss et al. (1997) found b equal 4.6 as a good agreement for 110 \nsandstones from three reservoirs.  \n All the models described above were used to predict permeability \nof tight gas sandstones originatted from the field named A in this work. \nFor all five TGS samples analyzed, the values of permeability measured \nby PDP technique were used to compare and validate the empirical and \nsimulated results. In the next chapter the set of methods and techniques \napplied in the present study is summarized. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n46              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n3. ANALYTICAL METHODS: THEORETICAL ASPECTS   \n\n3.1. Pulse-decay permeability \n Difficulties in measuring permeability in reservoirs rocks below 1 \n(mD) is mainly due to very low flow rate, difficult to establish in such \nrocks. Experiments require therefore an adaptation of the experimental \ndevices initially used for more permeable rocks. In recent years, both \npulse-decay technique and steady-state technique have been used to \nmake gas permeability measurements in tight rocks. One of the purposes \nof this study is to apply the pulse-decay technique as proposed by \nJONES (1997) to obtain the experimental permeability values of low \n(and ultra-low) permeability tight gas sandstones from distinct wells. \nFor obtained values up to 0.001 mD we also compare the transient \nmethod from PDP with the traditional steady-state method. Another \nobjective of this work was to determine the correlations of Klinkenberg \ncorrection in a sense of build up a database through tight gas sandstones. \nAdditionally, the measured Klinkenberg permeability on TGS was used \nto validate empirical permeability obtained by the correlation of \nmeasured pore-structure parameters. Accurate determination of \npetrophysical properties (such the ones used in the empirical \npermeability models) of geological formations are necessary, among \nthem precise permeability values. \n Transient (or pulse-decay) permeability techniques have been \ndiscussed and unsteady-state permeameters have been built and reported \nin the literature (JONES, 1972). This differential technique permits \naccurate measurements of permeability in the micro-Darcy range in a \nreasonable length of time. According to Jones (1997) laboratory pulse-\ndecay measurements using a gas or liquid are effective for determining \nthe permeability of rocks in the range from 0.1 mD to 0.01 \u00b5D. With the \ncurrently advent in the petroleum industry in characterizing the \nproperties of unconventional reservoirs, the usage of pulse-decay \ntechnique has made feasible to measure the permeability of very tight \nrocks and shale. The scheme of a conventional pulse-decay apparatus, \nshown in Figure 3.1, consists of an upstream reservoir for gas or liquid \nof Vu, sample holder capable of applying high confining pressures, \nwhich contains a cylindrical rock sample (plug) of pore volume Vp, and \na downstream reservoir of volume Vd. A differential pressure transducer \nmeasures the pressure difference between the reservoirs Vu and Vd \nthrough the analyzed sample, and a second transducer measures the \nabsolute pressure, Pm, in the downstream reservoir. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             47 \n\n \nFigure 3.1: Scheme of a pulse-decay apparatus showing upstream and \n\ndownstream: reservoirs volumes (Vu, Vd), instantaneous pressures (Pu, Pd). \nThe core holder contains a pore volume (Vp) sample under confining \n\npressure (pc). During the test, the pressure difference across the sample \n(?P=Pu-Pd) is measured (JONES, 1997; DARABI et al., 2012). \n\n In this scheme the pressure in the upstream reservoir is increased \nby ?Pu, which is 1 to 3% higher them Pd, and is allowed to stabilize \nwhile achieving thermal equilibrium. When Valve 2 is open \u201cpressure \npulse\u201d is created to flow through the sample. The initial pressure \ndifference across the sample, ?P[0], is slightly less than ?Pu because of \nthe \u201cdead volume\u201d in the flow line between Valve 2 and the face of the \nsample. \n Data are analyzed from the solution of the diffusivity equation, \nwhich is derived by combining the differential form of Darcy\u2019s law with \nthe continuity equation (JONES, 1997). The sample is pressured to be \ninitially at a uniform pore pressure, Pd[0], throughout. The time \nrequired for this step when analyzing tight gas sandstones is about 2 \nhours. At a time t=0, a pulse of slightly higher pressure, ?P[0], is \napplied to its upstream reservoir. As gas flows from Vu into the sample, \nthe pressure in Vu declines, while the pressure in Vd remains constant \nfor a short period of time until the pressure pulse has transversed the \nlength of the sample. Then the pressure in Vd rises. Because Pu[t] \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n48              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\ndeclines and Pd[t] rises, ?P[t] continues to diminish and gradually \napproaches zero. The rate of pressure decay depends on permeability. \nThe lower the permeability is the slower the decay. Figure 3.2 \nexemplifies the decay for rocks belonging to a same field as well as \nshale. Observe the time differences between TGS and shale, also \nfractured shale \u201cA\u201d. \n\n \nFigure 3.2: Semi-log pulse-decay ?P x t: TGS (top) and shale (bottom). \n\n The general solution for the pressure difference as a function of \ntime was presented by DICKER and SMITS (1988) and described as \nfollows (JONES, 1997). \n Having adequate bounding conditions it is possible to show that \ndimensionless pressure difference, ?PD, between Vu and Vd decays \nexponentially with elapse time, tD as: \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             49 \n\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2\n\n2 2 2 2\n1\n\n( ) ( 1) ( )( )\n2 exp( ),\n\n( ) ( )\n\nm\nm m m\n\nD m D\nm m m\n\na b b a b\nP t\n\na a b b ab a b ab\n? ? ?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n?\n\n=\n\n+ ? ? + +\n? = ?\n\n+ + + + + + +?\n \n\n(3.1) \n\nwherein ?m are roots of the equation: \n\n2\n\n( )\ntan ,\n\na b\nab\n?\n\n?\n?\n+\n\n=\n?\n\n (3.2) \n\na is the ratio of the compressive storage of the sample\u2019s pore volume to \nthat of the upstream reservoir,  \n\n11\n\n( )\n,\n\n( )\np g pv\n\ng V\n\nV c c\na\n\nV c c\n+\n\n=\n+\n\n (3.3) \n\nb is the ratio of the compressive storage of the sample\u2019s pore volume to \nthat of the downstream reservoir,  \n\n22\n\n( )\n.\n\n( )\np g pv\n\ng V\n\nV c c\nb\n\nV c c\n+\n\n=\n+\n\n (3.4) \n\nIn Eq.

However, when the pressure difference across the \ncore is large or the initial core pressure is low, the test in low-\npermeability samples will take some time and the analytical solution \nmay lead to a significant error in pressure-decay prediction (DARABI et \nal., 2012). It happens because of the deviations on the assumptions that \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n50              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nthe gas density (?g), viscosity (?g) and volumetric gas compressibility \n(defined by 1/ /g g gc P? ?= \u00d7? ? ) are constant. DARABI et al.

The calibration of internal parts of the equipment such as the tank \nvolumes and the transducers have been realized by the equipment \nsupplier and, the volume of external upper and lower nitrogen lines were \nmeasured and added to the equations of the PDP equipment. One of the \nmost critical difficulties while performing a PDP experiment is \nmaintenance of constant temperature as the equations developed using \nthis technique assume isothermal nitrogen expansion (JONES, 1972). \nTo ensure a constant temperature we isolated the experimental setup in a \nplastic casing as shown in Figure 3.3(b). \n\n3.2. Nitrogen gas adsorption \n\n3.2.1. Principles and properties \n\n Physical gas adsorption is a technique that accurately determines \nthe amount of gas adsorbed on a solid material, which is a direct \nmeasure of the porous properties and structure. The isotherm obtained \nfrom N2 adsorption, when applied over a wide range of relative \npressures (P/Po), can provide information on the surface area, pore \nvolume and PSD from 0.5 to 200 nm (GROEN et al., 2003). The \nclassical pore size model developed by Barret et al. (1951), BJH after  \nBarret, Joyner and Halenda, which is based on the Kelvin equation and \ncorrected for multilayer adsorption, is most widely used for calculations \nof the PSD over the mesopore range. On the other hand, the BET \n(Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) method of Brunauer et al. (1938) is the \nmost widely used to assess the specific surface areas of porous materials \nfrom adsorption data. \n Low temperature nitrogen adsorption measurements are largely \nused for characterization of porous solids where adsorbed amounts and \ncapillary condensation/evaporation pressures are related to the \ngeometrical properties of the porous matrix (GREGG and SING, 1982). \nFor instance, the specific surface area of porous materials is usually \nassessed from the adsorption experiments prior to the capillary \ncondensation of the fluid on a region which the fluid is assumed to cover \nuniformly the pore walls. The thickness of the film adsorbed on the pore \nsurface (t) is also an essential parameter to describe the phenomenon of \ncapillary condensation (COASNE et al., 2004).  \n In Figure 3.4 snapshots of gas atoms adsorbed in the pore walls \n(considering a medium with pore bodied and throats) at different \npressures are shown. As one can see at low pressures, the pore surface is \ncovered by a quasi-homogeneous layer of gas atoms (a). As the relative \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n52              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\npressure is increased the filling of the pore with constriction (pore \nthroats) starts with followed condensation of gas atoms in the part of the \nconstricted pore. As expected, this condensation pressure is smaller than \nthat obtained for the pore bodies (cavities). The condensation in the \nconstricted part leads to the presence of hemispherical menisci in the \ninterfacial region between the largest cavity and the constriction. These \ncurved interfaces together with the film adsorbed on the wall of the pore \nbody define a gas bubble inside the pore (see Figure 3.4 (b) and (c)). \nFinally, all remained open pore cavity on the sample get completely \nfilled once that the condensation of gas bubble occurs at a pressure \nP/Po~ 1. \n\n \nFigure 3.4: Configurations of N2 atoms at 77 K in a pore with constrictions, \nfrom the beginning of the N2GA experiment (a) P/Po ~ 0.01 to the end of it \n\n(d) P/Po ~1 (modified from COASNE et al., 2004). \n\n3.2.2. Isotherms acquisition and classification \n\n When a specific gas is put in contact with a solid surface, \nmolecules of this gas will be adsorbed to the surface in amounts that are \na function of their partial pressure in the bulk pressure. An adsorption \nisotherm is simply the measurement of the quantity of a gas adsorbed \nover a range of relative pressures at a single temperature (77 K for the \nnitrogen gas adsorption). Depending on the type of the adsorbent (solid) \nor the adsorbate (gas) and on the intermolecular interactions between the \ngas and the surface, different shapes can be displayed by the isotherms. \nThe first systematic attempt to interpret the adsorption isotherms shapes \ninto a classification was introduced by Braunauer, Deming, Deming and \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             53 \n\nTeller (BDDT) in 1940 (BRUNAUER et al., 1940) who described five \ntypes. Much later SING et al. (1985) introduced an additional isotherm, \nwhich completes the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry \n(IUPAC) classification as illustrated in Figure 3.5. \n\n \nFigure 3.5: IUPAC classification for gas adsorption isotherms (above) and \n\ntypes of hysteresis loops (below) (SING et al., 1985). \n\nType I isotherms characterize microporous adsorbents. Types II and III \ndescribe adsorption on macroporous adsorbents with strong and weak \nadsorbate-adsorbent interactions, respectively. Types IV and V represent \nadsorption isotherms with hysteresis. Finally, Type VI has distinct \nadsorption steps (step-like) characteristics of multi-surface on non-\nporous adsorbents. The hysteresis loop (Type IV and V isotherms) is the \nchange where a lower branch of which represents measurements \nobtained by progressive addition of gas to the system, and the upper \nbranch by progressive withdrawal; hysteresis effects are liable to appear \nin isotherms of other types too (GREGG and SING, 1982).  \n Figure 3.5 (bellow) illustrates the types of hysteresis loops \naccording to SING et al. (1985). Hysteresis appearing in the multilayer \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n54              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nrange of physisorption isotherms is usually associated with capillary \ncondensation in mesopore structures. Two extreme types are shown as \nH1 and H4. In the former the two branches are almost vertical and \nnearly parallel over an appreciable range of gas uptake, whereas in the \nlatter they remain nearly horizontal and parallel over a wide range of \nP/Po. A feature common to many hysteresis loops is that the steep \nregion of the desorption branch leading to the lower closure point occurs \n(for a given adsorptive at a given temperature) at a relative pressure \nwhich is almost independent of the nature of the porous adsorbent but \ndepends mainly on the nature of the adsorptive (e.g. for nitrogen at its \nboiling point at P/Po~ 0.42 (SING et al, 1985; GROEN et al., 2003). \n Type H1 is often associated with porous materials compacts of \napproximately uniform spheres in fairly regular array, and hence to have \nnarrow distributions of pore size. For Type H2 loops the pore systems of \nsize and shape is not well-defined yet., indeed, in the past it was \nattributed to a difference in mechanism between condensation and \nevaporation processes occurring in pores with narrow necks and wide \nbodies (ink-bottle pores). The Type H3 (which does not exhibit any \nlimiting adsorption at high P/Po) is observed with aggregates of plate-\nlike particles giving rise to slit-shaped pores. Similarly, the Type H4 \nloop is often associated with narrow slit-like pores, but in this case the \nType I isotherm character is indicative of microporosity (SING et al., \n1985). Besides giving an indicative of the complexity of pore \nmorphologies, the isotherms in the present work were also used to \nobtain pore size distribution (micro- and mesopore regions) and the \nspecific surface area for the analyzed TGS. \n3.2.3. Adsorption theory for PSD calculation \n\n Nowadays the types of models available for the pore size \ncalculation using gas adsorption measurements are the density \nfunctional theory (DFT) or classical theory. Classical models are based \non the Kelvin equation and thickness for determining the pore size \ndistribution. Although the pore size distributions were calculated in the \npresent work by usage of the BJH and Dollimore-Heal (DH) \n(DOLLIMORE and HEAL, 1964; DOLLIMORE and HEAL, 1970) \nmethods based on the adsorption isotherms data and DFT method (DO \nand DO, 2003), only the traditional BJH method was applied for the \ncombination of N2GA and MICP. Therefore, a brief revision to this \nmodel is exposed. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             55 \n\n  The Barret, Joyner and Hallenda (BJH) theory (BARRET et al., \n1951) was applied to find the size distribution of the micro- and \nmesopores. The BJH analysis describes the capillary condensation \nphenomenon in a cylindrical pore as described by Figure 3.6.  \n\n \nFigure 3.6: (a) Pore filled by gas at P/Po ~1; (b) increasing on the adsorbed \n\ngas layer as P/Po increases (FERNANDES, 1990). \n\nIt is assumed that the condensation of a fluid in a pore of radius ro takes \nplace in the \u2018core\u2019 region, i.e., the inner part of the pore that has a radius \nro - t(P/Po), where t(P/Po) is the thickness of the film adsorbed on the \npore wall as a function of the relative pressure (P/Po) of the gas. Using \nthis model, it is predicted that the condensation of nitrogen in a pore of \nradius ro occurs at a pressure given by the following modified Kelvin \nequation: \n\n1ln ,N\no\n\no\no\n\nVP\nP P\n\nRT r t\nP\n\n??? ?\n= ?? ?\n\n? ?? ?? ? ?? ?? ?\n? ?? ?\n\n \n(3.7) \n\nwhere P is the system pressure, Po is the saturation vapor pressure of  \nnitrogen, ?N and V1 are the surface tension and molar volume, \nrespectively, of liquid nitrogen, R is the gas constant, T is the \ntemperature at which the isotherm is measured (77 K) and ? is a factor \nthat accounts for the shape of the gas/liquid interface. The latter is \nassumed to be cylindrical during the adsorption process (? = 1) and \nhemispherical during the desorption process (? = 2) (COASNE et al., \n2004). In this study, t (in both models BJH and DH) was determined \nusing the empirical Halsey equation for nitrogen (HALSEY, 1948): \n\n1\n3\n\n5\n3.54 .\n\nln\no\n\nt\nP\nP\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ?= ?\n? ?? ?\n? ?? ?\n? ?? ?? ?\n\n (3.8) \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n56              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n3.2.4. Adsorption theory for surface area measurements \n\n In the present thesis two methods were applied to measure \nspecific surface area of analyzed tight gas sandstones: Langmuir and \nBET theories. The Langmuir equation describes better microporous \nmaterial exhibiting Type I isotherms; it assumes adsorption limited to \nmonolayer. On the other hand BET method allows the estimation of \nspecific surface areas from adsorption isotherms on the basis of the \nmultilayer adsorption model (compare Figure 3.7).  \n\n \nFigure 3.7: Gas-surface interactions in the adsorption process in Langmuir \n\nand BET theories modified from FERNANDES (1990). \n\nThe hypothesis of the BET model is that (i) adsorption occurs on \nenergetically homogeneous sites having energy ?1 (also, the surface \ndensity of the sites is constant) and (ii) molecules can adsorb onto each \nother. In this case, the adsorption energy ?o for all molecules adsorbed \nabove the first layer is constant and equal to the cohesion energy in the \nbulk liquid. With these assumptions, it can be shown that adsorption \ndata (the adsorbed amount N versus the relative pressure P/Po) must \nobey the following equation: \n\n1 1\n,\n\n1\n\no\n\no o o\n\no\n\nP\nP C P\n\nN C N C PP\nN\n\nP\n\n? ?\n? ? ? ??? ? = + ? ?\n? ?? ? ? ??? ?? ?\n\n? ?? ?\n\n (3.9) \n\nwhere No is the monolayer capacity, i.e., the number of atoms needed to \nuniformly cover the substrate with one complete monolayer.

Mercury intrusion capillary pressure \n The mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP) method has \nbeen a viable tool for characterizing reservoir rocks for over 60 years \n(COMISKY et al., 2011) and is based on the fact that mercury behaves \nas a non-wetting liquid when in contact with most solids. Consequently, \nit does not penetrate into the openings and cracks of these substances \nwithout the application of pressure. Figure 3.8 illustrates the cumulative \npore structure acquired by Hg intrusion and respective stages of Hg \ninvasion of the sample in the penetrometer. The pressure (Pw) required is \na function of the contact angle (?Hg) of mercury with the porous material \nto be intruded, its gas/liquid surface tension (?Hg) and equivalent pore \nradius (rp). This relationship is given by the Young-Laplace law for the \nparticular case of cylindrical pores as the Washburn equation (KATE \nand GOKHALE, 2006): \n\n2 cos\n.Hg Hgp\n\nW\n\nr\nP\n\n? ?\n= ?  (3.11) \n\nThis equation dictates that with increasing pressure, the mercury will \nintrude into progressively narrower pores for constant values of ?Hg and \n?Hg. The volume of mercury invading the pores is measured directly as a \nfunction of applied pressure where the P-V data provides a unique \ncharacterization of the pore structure (ROOTARE and PRENZLOW, \n1967). The elevated pressures reached by the MICP equipments \nnowadays make the evaluation of very small pores possible, although \nthe integrity of the pore structure of analyzed medium is sometimes \ndoubted and discussed in the literature. Nevertheless, the maximum \npressure used in the present work was Pw = 413 MPa (rp ? 20 \u00c5). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n58              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 3.8: Hg volume versus pressure plot indicating structural strength \n\n(above) and respective states of Hg intrusion (in black) inside of pore \nsample in a penetrometer (below) (WEBB, 1993). \n\n During the MICP experiments some issues can be encountered \nwhich create errors in the results. The two most likely sources of errors \nin MICP measurements are caused by mercury conformance at low \npressures (COMISKY et al., 2011) and system compressibility at high \npressures (WEBB, 2001). Besides that another limitation on the results \nis related to the pore system geometry of natural materials such as \nreservoir rocks, being comprised by the so-called ink-bottle \nconfiguration.  Therefore the pore system may be described as a system \nof large chambers (ink-bottle type pores) interconnected by smaller \nthroats. In such a system pore network effects hence are assumed to be \nthe most important reason for the large hysteresis between intrusion and \nextrusion in MICP experiments (KAUFMANN et al., 2009); also a \nsuper estimation of the smaller pores (throat) in detriment of the bigger \nones (FERNANDES, 1994) might be observed shifting the pore size \ndistribution in the direction of the smaller pores. In Figure 3.9 a \nsimplified model of pore system with ink-bottle type pores is assumed, \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             59 \n\nallowing the visualization of pore filling aspects. As one can see, in (a) \nthe pores connected to the surface are still empty; filling starts with the \nlargest external surface connected pores as mercury is non-wetting and \nonly with increasing pressure smaller pores are filled (a?b?c). Dark \ngray represents the pores already filled in a pressure step backward and \nlight gray are the pores filled in a ahead pressure step. Ink-bottle type \npores will not be filled at the pressure corresponding to their radius but \nat a higher pressure level which corresponds to the largest connecting \nradius. Relatively large voids or even small pores which are connected \njust through even smaller pores to the external surface may be filled at \nhigher pressure as it would correspond to their actual size. \n\n \nFigure 3.9: Scheme of an array of chambers which are connected by \n\nsmaller throats (ink-bottle type pores) limitation the entrance of mercury in \nthe bigger pores (KAUFMANN, 2009).  \n\n3.4. X-ray diffraction (XRD) \n As known TGS and seal rocks are comprised by considerable \namount of very fine grained structures that X-ray methods, rather than \nhand specimen or optical methods, are used to identify them. X-Ray \ndiffraction is considered to be one of the best methods in defining clay \nminerals (ELGMATI, 2011). \n In 1912 the German physicist Max Von Laue discovered the \ndiffraction of X-rays on crystals as he related the passage of waves of \nlight through a periodic, crystalline arrangement of particles. The \nprinciple of X-ray diffraction measurements originated afterwards from \nBragg\u00b4s law formulated by Willian Henry Bragg and Willian Lawrence \nBragg. Bragg\u00b4s law (1912) explains the relationship between an incident \nand its detected beams with respect to the examined sample as \n(BUHRKE et al., 1998): \n\n2 sin ,hkln d? ?=  (3.12) \nwhere n is an integer (i.e. 1, 2, 3\u2026), ? is the wavelength of the incident \nX-ray beam, dhkl is the distance between atomic layers in a crystal with \nthe M\u00fcller index (hkl) and ? is the angle between the incident ray and \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n60              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nthe scattering planes. When X-ray radiation passes through matter, the \nradiation interacts with the electrons in the atoms, resulting in scattering \nof the radiation constructive and destructive interference will occur \n(FORMOSO, 1984). If the atoms are organized in planes (i.e., the matter \nis crystalline) and the distances between the atoms are of the same \nmagnitude as the wavelength of the X-rays undergo constructive \ninterference in accordance to Bragg's law. This result where X-rays are \nemitted at characteristic angles based on the spaces between the atoms \norganized in crystalline structures called plane is shown in Figure 3.10. \n\n  \nFigure 3.10: X-ray incident and scattered beam base on Bragg\u00b4s law \n\n(ELGMATI, 2011). \n\n We used X-ray diffraction (XRD) to semi-quantify clay and non-\nclay minerals in the TGS from field A and in the three studied seal \nrocks. \n\n3.5. Field emission scanning electron microscopy \n Characterizing TGS formations remains daunting, because its \nmicrostructure presents unique challenges in measurement and \ndescription since the resources are typically located in heterogeneous \nand complex geologic systems (BUCTHER and LEMMENS, 2011). In \nTGS formations usually the hydrocarbons are trapped in rocks marked \nby poorly connected networks of pores with dimensions as small as a \nfew nanometers; clays are commonly associated with this small grain \nsize being highly variable and often associated to other minerals such as \nquartz, feldspar and calcite. In this context, the geometry and nature of \nthe mineralogical components are easier to be described optically. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             61 \n\nTable 3.1: Comparison of different electron optical modes of analysis \ncommonly used for studies of clay mineral textures and compositions \n\n(modified from HUGGETT and SHAW, 1997). \n\nField emission SEM \n(SE) (FESEM)\n\ncoated or un-coated \nfracture surface\n\nmorphology, diagenesis 0.5 nm\n\nConventional SEM \n(SE) (CSEM)\n\ncoated or un-coated \nfracture surface\n\nmorphology, diagenesis 2.5 nm\n\nBackscattered SEM \n(BSEM)\n\npolished, C-coated \nsurface\n\npetrography, diagenesis, chemistry 0.5 - 3 ?m\n\nMicroprobe\npolished, C-coated \n\nsurface\nchemistry 0.5 - 3 ?m\n\nAnalytical electron \nmicroscopy (AEM)\n\nion-milled, dispersion \nmount\n\nmorphology, sedimentary \nmicrostructures, chemistry\n\n>2.5 nm\n\nHigh-resolution TEM\nion-milled, \nmicrotomed\n\nlattice imaging, micro-diffraction, \nchemistry\n\n0.3 nm\n\nInstrument Nature of sample Primary function in clay studies Spacial precision\n\n \n \n The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) permits the \nobservations and characterization of heterogeneous organic and \ninorganic materials on a nanometer (nm) to micrometer (?m) scale \n(GOLDSTEIN et al. 2003). Table 3.1 compares the limitations of \ndifferent optical modes for analyzing clay mineral fabrics and \ncompositions. High-resolution field emission scanning electron \nmicroscopy (FESEM) is achieved through use of a field emission gun \n(FEG) in place of the more conventional tungsten hairpin or LaB6 \nfilaments (HUGGETT and SHAW, 1997) where a resolution of 0.5 nm \ncan be accomplished. For backscattered scanning electron microscopy \n(BSEM) the optimal resolution is 0.5 ?m and 2.5 nm for conventional \nsecondary electron microscopy (CSEM). In the SEM techniques, the \nmicrovolume to be analyzed is irradiated with a finely focused electron \nbeam, which may be swept in a raster across the surface of the specimen \nto form images or may be static to obtain an analysis at one position. \nThe types of signals produced from the interaction of the electron beam \nwith the sample include secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, \ncharacteristic X-rays, and other protons of various energies. These \nsignals are obtained from specific emission volumes within the sample \nand can be used to examine many characteristics of the sample (surface \ntopology, crystallography, composition, etc) (GOLDSTEIN et al., \n2003). Figure 3.11 shows a schematic illustration of the interaction \nvolume of incident electron beam within the analyzed material. It is \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n62              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\npossible to see the origin of distinct sources of generated electrons in the \nsample.  \n\n \nFigure 3.11: Schematic representation of processes resulting from electron \nbombardment showing the emissions coming from different depths, e.g. CL \n\nand X-rays are emitted from deeper section levels than the secondary \nelectrons (SALH, 2011). \n\n The number of backscattered electrons (BSE) produced from a \ngiven atom is proportional to the atomic number, thereby materials \ncomposed of heavy atoms will backscatter more electrons, resulting in \nbrighter gray tones in the image relative to less dense materials. Hence, \nBSE produce an image that is related to material composition, providing \nboth spatial and chemical information. With the use of backscattered \nscanning electron microscopy, e.g., it is possible to identify individual \nmineral constituents of the TGS and seal rocks by virtue of their atomic \nnumber (Z) contrast and differential hardness (relief). Valuable \ninformation can be obtained relating to particle form, orientation, \ntexture, internal structure and mineralogical composition of the analyzed \nrock. On the other hand secondary electron images are acquired for \ndocumenting topographic variation within the rock. \n In the present thesis we analyzed polished and fractured samples \nby SEM and FESEM techniques. Mechanically polishing TGS were \nselected to investigate mainly the microstructure (including pore \nmorphology and porosity), composition, and mineral phases; while \nfractured samples provided new insight about the clays content and \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             63 \n\nshowing topographic variations. For this task, samples were examined \nusing two equipments: a Philips (FEI) XL40 and a Zeiss Ultra Plus for \nrespectively SEM and FESEM analysis. Both systems are located at the \nAustralian Resources Research Centre: Perth, Western Australia. Use of \nFESEM equipped with in-lens secondary electron (SE) detectors \nprovided greatly increased detail of nanometer-scale in analyzed TGS \nand seal rocks. Lower accelerating voltages (1\u201310 kV) were used to \nprevent beam damage of the sample which was also coated with carbon. \nWorking distances were 3 to 10 mm. \n\n3.6. X-ray computed tomography (CT) \n The development of modern imaging methods relies on the \nacquisition of three-dimensional reconstructions from a series of two-\ndimensional projections taken at different angles: the sample is rotated \nand the absorption of X-rays in different directions is recorded and used \nto produce a three-dimensional representation of the rock and fluids \n(BLUNT et al., 2013). X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an \nestablished and rapidly evolving technology of proven value for \ngeological investigations. Because of its origin outside of the earth \nsciences, the potential for application of CT imagery to geological \nproblems is only beginning to be explored (KETCHMAN and \nCARLSON, 2001). Typical X-ray energies are in the range 30\u2013160 keV \nfor microCT machines (with corresponding wavelengths 0.04-0.01 nm). \nResolution is determined by the sample size, beam quality and the \ndetector specifications; for cone-beam set-ups (in laboratory-based \ninstruments) resolution is also controlled by the proximity of the sample \nto the beam, while detecting absorption at a sufficiently fine resolution. \nCurrent microCT and nanoCT scanners will produce images of around \n10003-20003 voxels. To generate a representative image, the cores are \nnormally a few mm across, constraining resolution to a few microns; \nsub-micron resolution is possible using specially designed instruments \nand smaller samples (BLUNT et al., 2013). \n3.6.1. Principles of image acquisition \n\n Any image, seen in the microscope or taken by any type of \ncamera or other device, has to be transferred into computer memory. \nThis process is called image acquisition and can be performed in several \nways (WOJNAR, 1998). There are numerous methods for digital image \nacquisition intending the characterization of materials where \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n64              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nComplementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors (CMOS) and Charge \nCoupled Device (CCD) are the most commonly used devices. \n Computed Tomography (CT) technology involves taking a \nnumber of X-ray radiographs (projection images) at distinct angles by \nprojecting an X-ray beam through a sample to be analyzed (object) \n(KUMAR et al., 2011). When photons interact with solids and complex \nbiological materials they are absorbed, scattered (elastic or inelastic), \ndiffracted, refracted, or transmitted through the material. During \nabsorption of photons, emission of electrons, visible light, and X-rays \nalso takes place. At its most basic level, absorption of X-rays occur \nwhen an incoming X-ray photon is absorbed, and this results in the \nejection of electrons from the inner shell of the atom, and the atom is \nionized. The ionized atom will eventually return to its neutral state \n(filling the vacated spot in the inner shell) often with the emission of an \nX-ray characteristic of the atom (WILDENSCHILD and SHEPPARD, \n2013). As the X-rays beams traverse through the object being scanned \nits energy is attenuated and the projection images are formatted on a \ndetector. The attenuation of X-ray beam energy depends primarily on \nthe density and thickness of the object in the beams path. The basic \nequation for attenuation of a mono-chromatic beam, i.e. one in which all \nphotons have the same energy and wavelength, through a solid object is \ndescribed by the Lambert-Beer's Law (KAK and SLANEY, 1999): \n\nexp[ ],oI I x?= ?  (3.13) \nwhere I is the X-ray beam intensity after passing through an object, I0 is \nthe initial X-ray intensity, \u00b5 is the linear attenuation coefficient for the \nmaterial being scanned (units: 1/length), and x is the length of the X-ray \npath through the material, i.e. the thickness of the object in the direction \nof the X-ray beam. From Eq. (3.13) we see that I is a decreasing \nfunction of distance, x, (the exponential argument is negative), \nindicating that the incident X-rays, I0, are attenuated as they pass \nthrough the object. Materials with a high attenuation coefficient will \ntherefore allow X-rays to penetrate only a relatively short distance, \nwhereas materials with a low attenuation coefficient are more easily \npenetrated (KETCHAM and CARLSON, 2001; WILDENSCHILD and \nSHEPPARD, 2013). \n3.6.2. The basics of X-ray micro- and nanotomography \n\n If both Io and I(x) can be measured from Eq. (3.13), it is possible \nto calculate the average linear attenuation coefficient of a material \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             65 \n\nhaving n phases (a composite material such as rocks). To accurately \nidentify and classify objects of different composition and density, \nsufficient variation in attenuation coefficients are needed. The gray level \nvalue of each pixel in each projection image is a representation of the \nnet intensity I of the X-ray beam emerging out of the object in the \ndirection along a line connecting the X-ray source to the image pixel. In \nother words, it represents the sum of attenuation coefficients of a \nnumber of tiny volume elements of the object lying along that direction \nof the beam. As shown in Figure 3.12, during acquisition of an X-ray \nmicro- or nanoCT scan the sample is mounted on a high-resolution \nrotary stage and illuminated with X-rays.  \n\n \nFigure 3.12: Scheme of a X-ray CT station. \n\nProjections (radiographs) are typically collected at fixed and angular \nincrements while the sample is either rotated continuously or step \nscanned. The total rotational angle depends upon the geometry of the \nsample and the beam, but typically is either 180\u00b0 when a nearly parallel \nbeam is used (typically at a synchrotron) or 360\u00b0 for a cone-beam \ngeometry (typically in a laboratory apparatus) (BAKER et al., 2012). \nAfter passing through the sample the X-rays are then imaged with a 2D \ndetector. The X-rays are normally converted into visible light by a \nscintillator screen. The visible light image is magnified with a lens and \nthen detected by either a cooled CCD (charge-coupled device) camera or \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n66              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\na CMOS-based detector. Each of these 2D radiographic projection, \ncarrying the information of X-ray attenuation through different volume \nelements (voxels) are collected at different angles of the object and then \ncombined together to reconstruct (back-calculate) the 3D volume of the \nanalyzed specimen (KUMAR et al., 2011). The most used algorithm for \nreconstructing the 3D volume from a cone-beam microCT is based in \nFeldkamp, DAVIS and KRESS (1984) work. \n  \n\n \nFigure 3.13: Typical tomography setup at a synchrotron beam-line(a) and \n\nfor a microCT system with fan- (b) and cone- (c) beam configurations \n(WILDENSCHILD and SHEPPARD, 2013). \n\n In 2001 Ketcham and Carlson point out the divergence in the \ncalculation from Lambert-Beer law for industrials CT, as the precise \nform of the X-ray spectrum and its variation at off-center angles in a \nfan- or cone-beam, is usually only estimated theoretically rather than \nmeasured. However, the scintillation and detection devices used \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             67 \n\nnowadays are very similar for the three types of systems (synchrotron, \nfan-beam and cone-beam) with any differences being due to the need to \nkeep electronic components out of the beam-line at synchrotrons. \nBesides, the fact that geometric magnification from cone shaped beam \n(as the one used in the present work) allows efficient large area detectors \nto be used in lab-scale systems (WILDENSCHILD and SHEPPARD, \n2013). The setup comparing synchrotron, fan-beam and cone-beam \ntomography imaging configuration according WILDENSCHILD and \nSHEPPARD (2013) is illustrated in Figure 3.13.   \n3.6.3. Evolution of microCT in material science  \n\n In the last few years micro computed tomography (microCT) a \nnon-destructive imaging procedure has become an important technique \nfor research of material properties (TORQUATO, 2000; YOUSSEF et \nal., 2005; LIU and REGENAUER-LIEB, 2011). CT imaging was \nintroduced in 1970s and was principally used for clinical and bio-\nmedical purposes (BERA et al., 2011). MicroCT, i.e., tomography \nimaging with a resolution in the order of \u00b5m came into existence in the \nearly 1980s and was quickly extended to other fields like geology, \nelectronics and composite materials (RITMAN, 2004; BERA et al., \n2011). Recent technology developments allow the 3D characterization \nof samples, up to few millimeters in diameter, at a detail resolution \ndown to nanometer scale. This technology is what we call in the present \nwork as nanoCT.  \n Despite being rather slow and expensive, the methodology has \nproved its worth, particularly in very important applications such as \nunderstanding the pore structure and transport properties of reservoir \nrocks for oil, gas and CO2 geo-sequestration (YANG et al., 2013). For \nreservoir engineering related applications, in this work we exposed tight \ngas sandstones (TGS) samples to X-ray microCT and nanoCT to \ndetermine information about its pore network morphology, down to the \nsub-microns order. One of the key steps for realistic pore space \ndetermination with the help of microCT and nanoCT techniques is the \npreparation of the samples for a given image resolution. For micron \nand/or nano scale resolution, one needs a very small sample size in the \norder of a few to sub-millimeters as shown in Figure 3.14 where a \nrelation between sample size and image resolution is plotted for \ndifferent 3D imaging techniques. As the resolution is very high, the field \nof view decreases proportionally (BERA et al., 2011) so the sample \ndiameter is selected as the maximum size which permits sufficient X-ray \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n68              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\ntransmission for imaging (YANG et al., 2013). In the present study all \nanalyzed samples were manufactured as mini core samples to minimize \nlosses. The diameters of mini cores were respectively 7 mm, 2 mm and \n0.1 mm for resolutions of 0.7, 0.3 and 0.064 ?m.  \n \n\n  \nFigure 3.14: Relation between sample size and image resolution obtained \n\nby different 3D image techniques (courtesy from Carl Zeiss X-ray \nMicroscopy, Inc). \n\n3.6.4. Post-processing and 3D images analysis \n\n Beyond visualization of the reconstructed sample volume via 3D \nrendering procedures, the main purpose of image processing is the \nquantitative characterization of data volumes (BAKER et al., 2012). A \nnumber of parameters related to the microstructure can be extracted \nfrom an X-ray CT data set when the coherence of the X-ray beam and \nthe spatial resolution are adequate to resolve the features of interest in \nthe analyzed material. In geosciences, the geometry and organization of \nrock components, such as pores or fractures, and zones with chemical \nalteration or with different compositions, are the main interest by \nperforming X-ray micro- and nanoCT analysis. In our particular case of \nlow-permeability TGS, micro- and nanoCT were used to image and \nquantify the textural and morphological characteristics of the rock \nconstituents, such as porosity, pore size distribution, geometry and \norientation of pores and specific surface. The tortuosity which describes \nthe topology of the overall pore and pore-throat networks (BAKER et \nal., 2012) was also measured.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             69 \n\n Prior to the quantification and morphological analysis of the 3D \nreconstructed images is the selection of a region of interest (ROI) of the \nsample. The ROI should be large enough to be representative of the \nsample complexity and heterogeneity (i.e., a representative elementary \nvolume), but small enough to not overwhelm the available computing \nresources (BAKER et al., 2012). After extracting a ROI, processing step \ninvolving the application of one or more grayscale-to-grayscale filters \ncan also be performed. These filters are applied to reduce noise and \neliminate artifacts, enhance object edges, and increase the visibility of \ndifferent phases based upon their X-ray attenuation (BAKER et al., \n2012). Next step is to procedure the segmentation. One of the most \nstraightforward techniques to segment a gray-scale CT image into a \nbinary (or two-level) image is to define a threshold value. Traditionally, \naccomplishing a segmentation based in thresholding is to define a range \nof brightness values in the original image, select the pixel within this \nrange as belonging to the foreground, and reject all of the other pixels to \nthe background. Voxels with a gray value lower than that threshold \nvalue are considered to be the material phase to be analyzed (most cases \npores). Following segmentation, a cleaning procedure using \nmorphological operations can be applied to remove e.g. small numbers \nof pixels supposed not to be of interest, which are caused by artifacts. \nOnce the segmented volume has been extracted microstructural \ninformation of individual or connected objects of interest can be \nquantified. From this data, conclusions may be drawn as to the effect of \npore network on the transport properties (BLUNT et al., 2002; AL-\nKHARUSI and BLUNT, 2007) as permeability of tight sandstones as \nunconventional resource. \n3.6.5. Permeability modeling based upon CT reconstructions \n\n In addition to quantifying and evaluating pore structure \ninformation, X-ray CT datasets can be used as a basis for permeability \nsimulations, still in its infancy in geosciences (BAKER et al., 2012). \nPermeabilities can be calculated by combining lattice-Boltzmann \nsimulations with microCT reconstructions that have been segmented \ninto fluid-containing vesicles (pores) and solid matrix. The lattice-\nBoltzmann (LB) method simulates continuum fluid flow by modeling \ngas-molecule collisions on a lattice (DOS SANTOS et al., 2005) and it  \nyields approximate solutions of the unsteady, incompressible Navier-\nStokes equations furnishing the fluid velocity and stress on the lattice at \ndiscrete time points (BAKER  et al., 2012). Nonetheless, there is still a \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n70              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nlack in the studies of permeability modeling based upon CT \nreconstructions for unconventional reservoirs, especially for TGS in \n?Darcy order as the ones analyzed in this thesis. To point out, e.g., \nTIWARI et al. (2013) recently published a work in which they \ncharacterize oil shale pore structure before and after pyrolysis by using \nX-ray microCT. The 3D pore network structure had pores as large as \n500 ?m generated after pyrolysis and the results of permeability found \nby LB simulation were from 173 to 2919 Darcy due to the considerable \namount of fractures generated.  \n Figure 3.15 illustrates, according to BAKER et al. (2012), a \ntransformation from a microCT image to a permeability simulation.  \n\n \nFigure 3.15: LB simulations from CT image. On the left side, a segmented \nimage is shown with the true shape of the vesicles superimposed on white \n\n(pores) and green (solid) voxels. Enlarged on the right side are \nrepresentative lattice nodes and the discrete fluid particle velocities; the \n\nmean fluid velocity and stresses are obtained from moments of this discrete \nvelocity distribution.

Note that fluid within every \ndomain that is enclosed by boundary nodes (i.e., the solid) develops a \nhydrostatic pressure when a steady uniform body force is applied to all \nlattice nodes. After reaching steady state, which typically occurs in \nO(104) lattice-Boltzmann time steps (depending on the porosity and \nfluid viscosity), the permeability is calculated as the product of the fluid \nviscosity and the ratio of the steady superficial fluid velocity to the \nmean pressure gradient. One challenge for these simulations is to obtain \nsample volumes that are large enough and have adequate spatial \nresolution but small enough to not overwhelm the available computing \nresources. The size of X-ray tomograms with micron-scale spatial \nresolution is limited by X-ray beam dimensions and detector size. \nFurthermore, simulation time becomes prohibitive on a single processor \nwith more than O(1003) lattice nodes (BAKER et al., 2012). \n\n3.7. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance \n For the past decades the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) \ntechnology has gained acceptance as a petrophysical tool for evaluating \nreservoir properties (CAI et al., 2013). NMR has been widely used, e. \ng., in petrophysical characterization of sandstones and carbonates \n(MARSCHALL et al., 1995; YAO et al., 2010), although little attention \nhas been paid in the use of this technique concerning to the study of \npetrophysical properties of tight gas sandstones.  \n Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers were \ndeveloped currently with logging tools so that wellbore measurements \ncould be duplicated on core samples in the laboratory (GRIFFIN et al., \n1993). The low frequency NMR spin\u2013spin relaxation time (T2) \ndistributions have been routinely applied in the petroleum industry to \ncharacterize rock matrix and measure downhole fluid properties \n(HIRASAKI et al., 2003). NMR analysis can be performed in both the \nsaturated and partially saturated states samples. In the laboratory NMR \nstudies are routinely conducted for the following purposes \n(WIKIPETRO \u2013 NMR Petrophysics): \n\n- Verifying formation porosity; \n- Evaluating textural effects, such as microporosity, on NMR-\n\nlog response; \n- Determining formation-specific models that enhance the \n\naccuracy of determining bulk-volume-irreducible (BVI) \nwater, free-fluid index (FFI), and, ultimately, permeability; \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n72              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n- Developing models to identify and quantify hydrocarbons, \nincluding residual oil; \n\n- Developing models to predict changes in pore size (facies). \n The connection between NMR measurements and petrophysical \nparameters stems from the strong effect that the rock surface has in \npromoting magnetic decay of saturating fluids. Therefore, a brief survey \non the principles and the applicability of low-field NMR in structural \nstudies of reservoir rocks is presented following. \n3.7.1. Principles of NMR \n\n The NMR phenomenon is based on the fact that nuclei of atoms \nhave magnetic properties that can be utilized to yield chemical \ninformation. Quantum mechanically subatomic particles (protons, \nneutrons and electrons) have spin. In some atoms (e. g. 12C, 16O, 32S) the \nspins are paired and cancel each other out so that the nucleus of the atom \nhas no overall spin. However, in many atoms such as 1H, 13C, 31P, 15N, \n19F the nucleus does possess an overall spin (EDWARDS, 2010). In this \nmatter, NMR measurements can be made on any nucleus that has an odd \nnumber of protons or neutrons or both. Hydrogen, which has only one \nproton and no neutrons, is abundant in both water and hydrocarbons, has \na relatively large magnetic moment, and produces a strong signal \n(COATES et al., 1999). Following the monograph \u201cNMR Logging: \nprinciples &amp; applications.\u201d by COATES et al. (1999), the concepts in \nfundamentals of NMR physics can be found to be: nuclear magnetism, \npolarization, T1 and T2 relaxation times, pulse tipping, free induction \ndecay and spin echoes and CMPG pulse sequences. \n\n3.7.1.1. Polarization  \n\n The first step in a NMR measurement consists in aligning \nmagnetic nuclei with a static magnetic field, B0. When B0 is applied to a \nmagnetic nucleus, B0 exerts a torque on the nucleus that acts to align the \nnuclear spin axis with B0. When a torque is applied to a spinning object, \nthe axis of the object moves perpendicular to the torque in a motion \ncalled precession (Figure 3.16, left). Thus, when B0 is applied to a \nmagnetic nucleus, the nucleus will precess around B0. The precessional \nfrequency (f) is called the Larmor frequency and given by: \n\n,\n2\n\noBf\n?\n?\n\n=  (3.14) \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             73 \n\nwhere ? is the gyromagnetic ratio, a measure of the strength of the \nnuclear magnetism. For hydrogen, ?/2? = 42.58 MHz/tesla. For a given \nmagnetic field, different nuclear species have different Larmor \nfrequencies; therefore, the various species can be differentiated on the \nbasis of these frequencies. Alternatively, for a given nuclear species, \nsuch as hydrogen, ? has a fixed value being the Larmor frequency is a \nfunction of the strength of the static magnetic field.  \n\n \nFigure 3.16: Under external magnetic field application (left), the \n\nprecessional frequency of a nucleus will depend on its gyromagnetic ratio \nand the strength of this field. The alignment of the precessional axis of the \n\nnucleus with respect to the direction of the external field (right) will \ndetermine the energy state of the nucleus (COATES et al., 1999). \n\n According to quantum mechanics, when a proton is subjected to \nan external magnetic field it is forced into one of two energy states as \nshown in Figure 3.16 (right). This energy state of a particular proton \ndepends on the orientation of the precessional axis of the proton with \nrespect to the direction of the external field. When the precessional axis \nis parallel to B0, the proton is in the low-energy state, which is the \npreferred state. When the precessional axis is anti-parallel to B0, the \nproton is in the high-energy state. The direction of B0 is designated as \nthe longitudinal direction.  \n When a large number of spinning protons are precessing about \nB0, more spins are precessing parallel to B0 than anti-parallel (COATES, \net al., 1999). The difference between the number of protons aligned \nparallel and anti-parallel to the B0 field forms the bulk magnetization M0 \nthat provides the signal measured by a NMR device. Therefore, the \nmacroscopic magnetization M0 is defined as the net magnetic moment \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n74              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nper unit volume, given by the Curie\u2019s Law for the case of N nuclei per \nunit volume: \n\n2 2\n\n2\n\n( 1)\n,\n\n3(4 )o o\nh I I\n\nM N B\nkT\n\n?\n?\n\n+\n=  (3.15) \n\nwith k being the Boltzman\u2019s constant, T the absolute temperature in \nKelvin; h the Planck\u2019s constant and I the spin quantum number of the \nnucleus.  \n\n3.7.1.2. Pulse tipping and free induction decay \n\n The second step performed in a NMR measurement is to tip the \nmagnetization from the longitudinal direction to a transverse plane. This \ntipping is accomplished by applying an oscillating magnetic field (B1) \nperpendicular to B0. For effective tipping, the frequency of B1 must be \nequal the Larmor frequency of the protons relative to B0.  From the \nquantum mechanics view, if a proton is at the low-energy state, it may \nabsorb energy provided by B1 and jump to the high-energy state. The \napplication of B1 also causes the protons to precess in phase with one \nanother. This change in energy state and in-phase precession caused by \nB1 is called nuclear magnetic resonance. \n The B1 field used in NMR logging is a pulsed oscillating \nmagnetic field. Macroscopically, magnetization is tipped 90\u00b0 B1 pulse \nand precesses in the transverse plane. When the B1 field is turned off, \nthe proton population begins to lose phase coherency (diphase), i.e., the \nprecessions of the protons will no longer be in phase with one another. \nTherefore, a receiver coil that measures magnetization in the transverse \ndirection will detect a decaying signal, usually exponential and called \nfree induction decay (FID). The FID time constant (T2\n\n*) is very short (in \nthe microseconds order) and caused by magnetic-field inhomogeneity, \n(?H), that are due to the magnetic field gradient and to certain molecular \nprocesses that occur in the measured material (COATES, et al., 1999). \nIn rocks, the internal gradients that degrade the measurements (G) \nresulting from field inhomogeneity are a complicated function of \nmicrogeometry but are on the order of ?H divided by the grain size \n(STRALEY et al., 1997). \n\n3.7.1.3. Spin echo detection and CPMG sequence \n\n The dephasing discussed about is reversible once the proton \nmagnetization vectors in the transverse planes can be re-phased when a \n180\u00b0 B1 pulse is applied. Considering that if a transverse magnetization \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             75 \n\nvector has phase angle ?, then application of a 180\u00b0 B1 pulse will change \nthe phase angle to -?. In effect, the phase order of the transverse \nmagnetization vectors is reversed, so that the slower vectors are ahead of \nthe faster vectors. When the faster vectors overtake the slower vectors \nthe rephrasing occurs and a signal is generated, see analogy in Figure \n3.17. This signal is called a \u201cspin echo\u201d or \u201cHahn echo\u201d and its intensity \ndepends only of the intrinsic T2 sample. The same time ? transpired \nbetween the application of the 90\u00b0 B1 pulse and the 180\u00b0 B1 pulse will \ntranspire between the application of the 180\u00b0 B1 pulse and the peak of \nthe spin-echo, so the spin echo peak occurs at 2?. This process of \nrephrasing (encoding) time equals dephasing (decoding) time defines \nthe inter-eco spacing (TE) and it is illustrated in Figure 3.18(a) which \nalso shows that although a single spin echo decays very quickly, 180\u00b0 \npulses can be applied repeatedly to rephase the magnetization \ncomponents and generate a series of spin echoes. The number of pulses \nin a pulse train is called NE. The entire pulse sequence of a 90\u00b0 B1 pulse \nfollowed by a long series of 180\u00b0 B1 pulses is called a CPMG sequence \nafter, Carr, Purcell, Meiboom, and Gill (COATES et al., 1999; CHEN et \nal., 2002). \n\n \nFigure 3.17: Analogy of dephasing process: (a) After departure the runners \n\nare dispersed (rephase); (b) Reversing the direction (180\u00b0 B1 pulse), they \ncan arrive together (dephasing) (DA SILVA J\u00daNIOR, 2013).  \n\nDuring a CPMG sequence, the 90\u00b0 B1 pulse reorients the polarization so \nthat there is no longer any longitudinal polarization of the protons, and \nthe 180\u00b0 B1 pulses suppress the buildup of new longitudinal polarization. \nHence, the protons are completely randomized at the end of a CPMG \nsequence. To start the next CPMG sequence, the protons must be \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n76              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\npolarized again, so a waiting time (TW) during which repolarization \noccurs is necessary. In Figure 3.18(b) a typical NMR measurement \ntiming diagram is illustrated. In the upper section of this figure two \nCPMG sequences are shown with each consisting of a 90\u00b0 B1 pulse, \nfollowed by a series of 180\u00b0 B1 pulses. In the bottom polarization events \n(T1 relaxation curves) and the spin-echo trains (T2 relaxation curves) \nassociated with two CPMG sequences are occurring, where T2 is \nobtained from the fitting of the generated curve by the maximal \namplitude of the spin echoes. In this thesis one-dimensional CPMG \nexperiments were performed to obtain transverse relaxation decays, \nwhich were subsequently inverted by one-dimensional inverse Laplace \ntransformation (GODEFROY and CALLAGHAN, 2003; HOLMES, \n2012) to obtain a transverse relaxation time distribution of T2. \n\n  \nFigure 3.18: CPMG pulse sequence used for generating a spin-echo train \nwhere spin-echoes of decreasing amplitude follow the 180\u00b0 B1 pulses (a). \n\n(b) NMR measurement timing diagram showing (top) CPMG pulse \nsequences and (bottom) polarization (T1) curves and spin-echo train \n\nacquisition (COATES et al., 1999). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             77 \n\n Simply put, the low-field NMR procedure measures three \nproperties: the equilibrium nuclear magnetization, Meq and the two \nprincipal NMR relaxation times, T1 (longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 \n(transverse relaxation time). Mn is proportional to the fluid-filled \nporosity, and T1 and T2 have been correlated with petrophysical \nproperties such as pore size, producible fluid, and permeability. \nAlthough T1 measurements are more common in the literature, they are \nmore time consuming to measure than T2 measurements (STRALEY et \nal., 1997). Hence, the parameter T2 is widely obtained in CPMG \nsequences and also the measured parameter in this work. \n3.7.2. Multi-exponential decay and properties in reservoir rocks \n\n Reservoir rocks commonly exhibit a distribution of pore sizes and \nfrequently contain more than one fluid type. Therefore, the spin echo \ntrain (transverse magnetization measurements) recorded with a CPMG \nsequence does not decay with a single T2 value but instead with a \ndistribution of T2 values that can be described by: \n\n2( ) (0) ,i\nt\n\nT\niM t M e\n\n?\n\n= ?  (3.16) \nwhere M(t) is the measured magnetization at time t, Mi(0) is the initial \nmagnetization from the ith component of relaxation; T2i is the decay \nconstant of the ith component of transverse relaxation and the summation \nis over the whole sample; i.e., all pores and all different types of fluid. \nFigure 3.19 illustrates the multi-exponential decay character of a porous \nmedium containing pores of different sizes and a single wetting phase. \nSurface to volume ratio (S/V) becomes dominant when a short inter echo \nspacing is used and the formation is only brine-saturated. Under this \ncondition, T2 is directly proportional to the pore size. When all pores are \nassumed to have the similar geometric shape, the largest pores (in the \nleft column) have the lowest S/V and thus the longest T2 value, while the \nsmallest pores have the highest S/V and the shortest T2 values. For a \nsingle pore, the magnetization decays exponentially, and the signal \namplitude is given by: \n\n2\n\n0( ) ,\nS\n\nt\nVM t M e\n\n? ? ?? ? ?\n? ?=  (3.17) \n\nwhere ?2 is the surface relaxivity and M0 is proportional to the volume \nof fluid in the pore. When the complete distribution (bottom of Figure \n3.19) of the 100% water-saturated pores is considered, these pores \nexhibit a distribution of T2 values.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n78              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 3.19: A 100% water-saturated pore (upper left) has a single T2 value \n\nthat depends on pore size, and thus its spin-echo train exhibits a single-\nexponential decay (upper right) that also depends on pore size. Multiple \npores at 100% water saturation (bottom left) have multiple T2 values that \n\ndepend on the pore sizes, and thus their composite spin-echo train exhibits \nmulti-exponential decay (bottom right) (COATES et al., 1999). \n\nThe associated signal amplitude is the sum of the signal amplitudes \narising from the fluid in individual pores, and the signal amplitude is \ngiven by: \n\n2\n\n0( ) ,i\nS\n\nt\nV\n\niM t M e\n? ? ?? ? ?\n? ?= ?  (3.18) \n\nwhere (S/V)i is the surface-to-volume ratio of the i\nth pore. Obviously, \n\n0(0) .iM M= ?  (3.19) \nIf the measured magnetization for 100% bulk water with the same \nsensitive volume, M100%(0), is known, then M(0) and M0i can be \ncalibrated to porosity: \n\n0 0\n\n100% 100% 100%\n\n(0)\n,\n\n(0) (0) (0)\ni i\n\ni\n\nM MM\nM M M\n\n? ?= = = =? ? ?

Therefore, the T2 distribution (in the form of the amplitudes \nM0i associated with the time constants T2i) can be calibrated to the \nporosity distribution considering the individual pores ?i with the \nassociated time constants T2i. \n The fact that NMR porosity depends only on the fluid contents of \nthe sample makes its measurements very capable to furnish connected \nand unconnected porosities. The strength of the NMR signal is \nproportional to the number of hydrogen atoms in a NMR tool-dependent \nrock volume (HAMADA et al., 2001). For water, oil and gas, NMR \nresults can be expressed as the percentage of fluid volume in the rock \nvolume (MENGER and PRAMMER, 1998). Figure 3.20 shows, in a \nqualitative way, the NMR properties of different fluids that can be found \nin the pore space (COATES et al, 1999). Hence, to allow reliable fluid \ntyping, linear gradient field NMR tools have to be capable of measuring \nrelaxation times from less than 1 ms to several seconds (HAMADA et \nal., 2001). As one can see in Figure 3.20, clay-bound water, capillary-\nbound water, and movable water occupy different pore sizes and \nlocations. Hydrocarbon fluids differ from brine in their locations in the \npore space, usually occupying the larger pores. In general, bound fluids \nhave very short T1 and T2 times, along with slow diffusion (D) that is \ndue to the restriction of molecular movement in small pores, behavior \nthat we expect to find in unconventional reservoir rocks such as the tight \ngas sandstones analyzed in this work. Free water commonly exhibits \nmedium T1, T2, and D values. Natural gas exhibits very long T1 times \nbut short T2 times and a single-exponential type of relaxation decay. \nNMR characteristics of oils dependent manly on oil viscosities, lighter \noils are highly diffusive, have long T1 and T2 times, and often exhibit a \nsingle-exponential decay. Based on the unique NMR characteristics of \nthe signals from the pore fluids, applications have been developed to \nidentify and, in some cases, quantify the type of hydrocarbon present \n(COATES et al., 1999). However, in this work NMR is used only to \nanalyze the pore structure of cleaned tight gas sandstones samples 100% \nsaturated under NaCl brines of 10 g/l salinity.   \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n80              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 3.20: T1, T2 and diffusion (NMR parameters) according to Coates et \n\nal., (1999), for different fluid types and pore sizes demonstrating the \nvariability and complexity of the T1 and T2 relaxation measurements. \n\n3.7.3. Transforming a T2 distribution to a pore size distribution \n\n The essential information on rock or sedimentary samples, which \ncan be provided by low-field NMR, is the size distribution of fluid-filled \npores (CHEN et al., 2002). As already stated above, theoretically, \npulsed NMR applied in the present work measures the magnetization \n(M) and the transverse relaxation time (T2) of hydrogen nuclei contained \nin the pore fluids. The measurement of T2 relaxation is preferred as it is \nfast and usually provides similar distribution to T1 (KLEINBERG et al., \n1993; YAO et al., 2010). For fluids confined in pores, the T2 value can \nbe shorter than that of the bulk fluid if the fluid interacts with the rock \nsurface, which promotes NMR relaxation (KENYON et al., 1992). \nThree different mechanisms, which operate in parallel, contribute to the \noverall apparent relaxation rate (1/T2A) of fluid in porous media (CHEN \net al., 2002): \n\n2 2 2 2\n\n1 1 1 1\n.\n\nA B S DT T T T\n= + +  (3.21) \n\nThe subscripts A, B, S and D indicate respectively: apparent, bulk, \nsurface-induced, and diffusion-induced mechanisms. The bulk \nrelaxation time is a property of the fluid only. Because the relaxation \ntime of liquid in rocks is much shorter than the relaxation time of bulk \nliquid, the bulk term above can be neglected. The surface-induced \nrelaxation (due to interaction between fluid and the solid surface) and \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             81 \n\ndiffusion-induced relaxation rates are given by (COATES et al., 1999; \nCHEN et al., 2002): \n\n2\n2\n\n1\n,\n\nS\n\nS\nT V\n\n?=  (3.22) \n\n2\n\n2\n\n( )1\n,\n\n12\no\n\nD\n\nG D\nT\n\n? ?\n=  (3.23) \n\nwhere ? is the gyromagnetic ratio, G is an internal magnetic field \ngradient, ? is the echo time and Do is the self-diffusion coefficient of the \nliquid. For low frequency and short pulse spacing, T2 carries the same \npore information as T1, and diffusion relaxation can be reduced when a \nlow and uniform magnetic field and a short pulse spacing is used (YAO \net al., 2010). In the present work we used low-field NMR technique, \nthus, the NMR T2 relaxation examined is mainly attributed to surface \nrelaxation, which occurs at the interface between water and rock grains. \nUnder this condition the enhancement in T2 decay coming from \ndiffusion in the inhomogeneous local magnetic fields is negligible \ncompared with the surface relaxation mechanism. Therefore, according \nto KENYON (1992) and KLEINBERG (1996) the measured T2 values \nare a function of the surface to volume ratio of pores given by: \n\n2\n2\n\n1\n,\n\nS\nT V\n\n? ? ?= ? ?\n? ?\n\n (3.24) \n\nwhere T2 is the transverse relaxation time resulting from surface \ninteractions and ?2 is a constant representing the transverse relaxation \nstrength. As T2 is proportional to V/S, which in turn is proportional to \npore size in rock samples, this means that in small pores relaxation is \nfaster than in large pores as shown in Equation (3.24). \n A rock generally consists of a large number of pores of different \nsizes. When two or three fluid phases are present, however, the non-\nwetting phases occupy the larger pores while the wetting phase occupies \nthe smaller pores because of the capillary effect. In addition, the \nrelaxation rate of non-wetting fluids is smaller than that of wetting fluids \nbecause the T2 of non-wetting fluid does not include the surface term. \nBoth the capillary and surface effect result in shorter T2 for wetting-\nphase fluids compared to the T2 for the same fluid types in bulk. Much \nless change is expected for the non-wetting fluid T2. Thus, different fluid \nphases can be identified by carefully analyzing the T2 distribution for \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n82              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nmultiphase saturation cases, not the case of present thesis where cleaned \nsamples saturated with water were analyzed. \n In conventional reservoir, NMR has the capacity to sense fluids \nin the pore space pretty much independent of lithology. The strength of \nthe NMR signal is directly proportional to the number of hydrogen \natoms present which provides a direct porosity measurement in brine \nsaturated rocks. The relaxation time in the fast diffusion limit can be \ndirectly related to the pore body containing the fluid. On the other hand, \nbecause in unconventional reservoir (like shale and TGS), the porosities \nare typically much smaller than in other reservoir rocks, the signal \nstrength is very weak. E.g., in a situation where there is a significant \nfraction of components with T2 of 1 ms or shorter, the CPMG with ? of 1 \nms will underestimate the contribution from this part (smaller pores) in \nan ordinary T2 distribution. Therefore, as one can see from Eq. (3.23) a \nway to include signal and information that is initially lost or weighted \ndifferently with a bigger ? value is simply to use smaller ? values. \nAccording to SONDERGELD et al. (2010), for a fully saturated Berea \nsandstone plug only 24 scans are required for accurate porosity \nmeasurement while an equivalent shale measurement 10,000 scans need \nto be taken. Small pore size equates to fast T2 relaxation time \n(SONDERGELD, et al., 2010). A typical T2 relaxation spectrum for AR \ngas shale is shown in Figure 3.21(a) (SONDERGELD, et al., 2010) \nwhere most of the signal occurs below the 3 ms cutoff (red vertical line) \nfor \u201cclay bound\u201d water. The authors used a surface relaxivity conversion \nof 0.05 ?m/ms and found consistent results of body pore sizes \ndistribution with SEM observations. Figure 3.21(b) illustrates the \ncontributions of T2 components using distinct motional encoding/ \ndecoding intervals, ?, from a CPMG sequence in a brine saturated rock \ncore sample (SORLAND et al., 2007). As one can see the usage of high \n? values might not represent the complete T2 distribution of the system. \n To assure the investigation of the smaller pores associated with \nthe clay content for the analyzed TGS, a total of 250 scans were \nperformed in small rock plugs (7 mm x 7 mm) using distinct intervals of \n? data points, ranging from 0.01 to 5000 ms. A Maran Ultra 23 MHz \n(0.5 Tesla) instrument was used to acquire data. In general, spectrometer \nfrequencies are specified using two parameters, a fixed number that \ndepends on the magnetic field strength of the instrument and the \nobserved nuclei, and a user adjustable offset that is added to the fixed \nnumber to give the frequency of the transmitted pulse. The spectral \nwidth is adjusted to be just large enough to span all of the resonance \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             83 \n\nlines in the spectrum.

Photoacoustic spectroscopy and thermal diffusivity  \nThe thermal diffusivity, (?), of a material is defined as: \n\np\n\nK\nC\n\n?\n?\n\n=  (3.25) \n\nwhere K is the thermal conductivity, Cp is the specific heat and ? is the \nmass density.  \n Thermal diffusivity is a dynamic thermal property which \ncharacterizes heat conduction inside a material under non-stationary \nconditions; this characteristic makes the thermal property essential for \nthe study and modeling of thermal processes (ANDREW, 1986; \nBALDERAS-L\u00d3PEZ, 2006). Thermal diffusivities of rocks are \ngenerally strong functions of temperature, values decreasing with \nincreasing temperature (SOMERTON, 1992). VOSTEEN and \nSCHELLSCHMIDT (2003) studing magmatic, metamorphic and \nsedimentary rocks, observed that in the interval of temperature range of \n1-300 oC, the thermal conductivity decreases between 25% and 44% and \nthe thermal diffusivity however by 42\u201354%. The rate of the heat flow, \nand hence how deep the changes in the temperature at the surface \npenetrate, depends on ? (SMITH, 2001). So in the context of the \npetroleum reservoir engineering, for a same geologic formation, the \nincrease of temperature with depth would be favorable to the efficiency \nof seal rocks but decrease the flow rate for the petroleum exploration. \nThe thermal diffusivity is directly related to the thermal conductivity \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n84              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nand rock thermal conductivity within any geothermal reservoir is a key \nparameter to the conductive heat flow, to the distribution of \ntemperatures and to the definition of a barrier to hold the accumulated \nenergy (ARRIAGA, 1993). The thermal conductivity of volcanic rocks \ndepends mainly on the characteristics of its mineral elements, on the \nconductivity of the fluids filling the pores and on the size and geometry \nof the pore space (ZIMMERMAN, 1988). In the present thesis we apply \nthe photoacoustic spectroscopy technology (PAS) in an open \nphotoacoustic cell (OPC) to investigate the thermal diffusivity of seal \nrocks originating from three different geologic fields. The obtained \nresults were correlated within mineralogy and pore structures of \nanalyzed rocks.  \n3.8.1. PAS signal and mechanisms \n\n When a modulated light beam impinges on the material inside a \nphotoacoustic gas cell, the absorbed light is converted into periodic heat \nand a PAS signal is created. The dependence of the PAS signal on the \noptical absorption coefficient and the light-to-heat conversion efficiency \nmay be used to calculate the nonradiative de-excitation efficiency and to \nstudy the photoinduced energy conversion process. The PAS signal is \ndirectly proportional to the light-to-heat conversion efficiency due to \nnonradiative processes in the material (ZIEGLER and HASSELMAN, \n1981). After the work of Rosencwaig and Gersho (1976), the PAS effect \nhas been used for measuring the thermal properties of solid samples in \ndifferent material science areas such as semiconductors (DE LIMA et \nal., 2007; POFFO et al., 2011); metals (LIMA et al., 2005; ROUSSET \net al., 1983); polymers (LACHAINE and POULET, 1984); sedimentary \nrocks (GUIMAR\u00c3ES et al., 2013) and coals (BISWAS et al., 1983). As \nwell as coal, being an opaque material which highly absorbs the incident \nlight, seal rocks are extremely heterogeneous materials and constituted \nof a very fine porous structure. It is well known that the elastic and \nthermal properties of microscopically inhomogeneous materials are \nsubstantially different from homogeneous materials (IVANOV et al., \n1992). In the modern view of materials, a solid may be comprised of \nfree electrons and atoms bound in a periodic arrangement called the \nlattice. Accordingly, transport of thermal energy may be due to two \neffects: the migration of free electrons and lattice vibrational waves. \nWhen viewed as a particle-like phenomenon, the lattice vibration quanta \nare termed phonons. In pure metals, the electron contribution to \nconduction heat transfer dominates, while in nonconductors such as seal \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             85 \n\nrocks and semiconductors, the phonon contribution is dominant \n(INCROPERA et al., 2006). For a thermally thick sedimentary seal rock \nsample, we expect the following two processes contributing to the PAS \nsignal amplitude: \n\n(i) Thermal diffusion or intraband nonradiative \nthermalization: \n\nWhen the absorbed photon energy is greater than the band gap an \nelectron is created in the conduction band and a hole is left in the \nvalence band. The excess energies of the electron (the energy \ndifference between the conduction band and the initial energy of \nthe photogenerated electron) and the hole (the energy difference \nbetween the valence band and the initial energy of the \nphotogenerated hole) appear in the respective carriers as kinetic \nenergy. The initial electron and hole distributions are not \nBoltzmann-like, and the first step toward establishing \nequilibrium is for the electrons and holes to interact separately \nthrough their respective carrier-carrier collisions and inter-valley \nscattering to form separate Boltzmann distributions of electrons \nand holes. The two Boltzmann distributions of electrons and \nholes can then be separately assigned an electron and hole \ntemperature that reflects the distributions of kinetic energy in the \nrespective charge carrier populations. The Boltzmann distribution \napplies only to particles at a high enough temperature and low \nenough density that quantum effects can be ignored. If photon \nabsorption produces electrons and holes, each with initial \nexcessive kinetic energies at least kT (k = Boltzmann's constant, \nand T = the temperature in Kelvin) above the conduction and \nvalence bands, then both initial carrier temperatures are always \nabove the lattice temperature; these carriers are called hot carriers \n(i.e. hot electrons and hot holes). This first stage of relaxation \noccurs very rapidly (<100 fs where 1 femtosecond = 10-15 s). It is \noften referred to as carrier thermalization and results in a thermal \ndistribution described by Boltzmann statistics. The next step is \nfor the hot electrons and hot holes to achieve thermal equilibrium \nwith the semiconductor lattice. The lattice temperature is \ndetermined by thermal equilibrium of the phonons with the \nsurroundings, and is the ambient temperature, which is lower \nthan the initial hot-electron and hot-hole temperatures. \nEquilibrium of the hot carriers with the lattice is achieved \nthrough carrier-phonon interactions (phonon emission through \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n86              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nelectron- and hole-scattering), in which the excess kinetic energy \nof the carriers is transferred to the phonons. The phonon emission \nresults in cooling of the carriers and heating of the lattice until \nthe carrier and lattice temperatures become equal. This process is \ncalled carrier cooling (NOZIK, 2001; SUN et al., 2005). \nIVANOV et al. (1992) performed a theoretical and experimental \ninvestigation of the transport of vibrational excitations in ceramic \nmaterials and ROSENCWAIG and GERSHO (1976) carried out \na deeper analysis of the theory of the photoacoustic effect with \nsolids. The contribution of the thermal diffusion (TD) process in \na thermally thick sample to the PAS signal decreases \nexponentially with the modulation frequency as: \n\n    \n\n1\nexp( ),S a f\n\nf\n= ?  (3.26) \n\nwhere \ns\n\nsla ?\n?= , f is the modulation frequency, ls is the \n\nthickness and ?s the thermal diffusivity of analyzed sample. The \nPAS signal phase shows a modulation frequency dependence of: \n\n.\n2ph\n\na f\n?\n\n? = ?  (3.27) \n\nAlso considering the thermal diffusion process contribution in \nthe PAS signal, Balderas-L\u00f3pez et al. (BALDERAS-L\u00d3PEZ et \nal., 1999) reported a new photoacoustic methodology to measure \nthermal diffusivity of materials. It is based only on the \nidentification of the first discontinuity in the photoacoustic phase \nlag predicted by using the Roscencwaig model without the need \nto fit a set of experimental data. According to these authors, the \ncomplete photoacoustic signal for an optically opaque sample is \ngiven by the following expression: \n\n  \n2 2\n\n1\n[cos( ) sinh( )] [sin( ) cosh( )]\n\ntan( )\nexp arctan ,\n\n2 tanh( )\n\nS W\nx x x x\n\nx\ni\n\nx\n?\n\n=\n+ +\n\n? ?? ?? ?\n\u00d7 ? ?? ?? ?? ?\n\n? ?? ?? ?? ?\n\n (3.28) \n\nwhere \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             87 \n\n2\ng sYW\nf\n\n? ?\n?\n\n= , cx f f= and \n\n           2 .\ns\n\nc\ns\n\nf\nl\n?\n?\n\n=  (3.29) \n\nHere, ?s and cf  are, respectively, the thermal diffusivity of the \ngas inside the photoacoustic chamber and the characteristic \nfrequency which characterizes the modulation frequency where \nthere is a transition from the thermally thin regime ( cff &lt;) to \nthe thermally thick regime ( cff > ). The photoacoustic phase \nlag mentioned above has discontinuity points due to the tan(x) \ndependence, which occur at frequencies given by: \n\n( )\n2\n\n2\n2 1 ,\n\n4 c\nf n f\n\n?\n= +  (3.30) \n\nwhere n is a numeral. The first discontinuity in the photoacoustic \nphase lag corresponds to n=0. When TD process is present in an \nanalyzed sample, it is observed in the low frequency range.   \n(ii) Thermoelastic bending: \nWhen a temperature gradient is generated within the sample, \nacross its thickness, the thermoelastic bending process \ncontributes to the PAS signal. This contribution shows a \nmodulation frequency dependence of the type 0.1?f . The thermal \ndiffusivity can be determined by fitting the phase of the PAS \nsignal to the expression: \n\n         1\n1\n\ntan .\n1\n\nph o\na f\n\n?\n? ?\n\n? = ? + ? ?\n?? ?? ?\n\n (3.31) \n\nWith constant a being the same as showed in process (i). When \nthe process (ii) is present, it occurs in the higher frequency range \nafter the thermal diffusion process. Thus, analysis of the phase of \nthe PAS signal can be used to identify this process and determine \nthe thermal diffusivity. \n\nIn a practical manner, the contribution of each process to the pressure \nvariation in the photoacoustic cell can easily be found through the \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n88              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nfollowing procedure (POFFO et al., 2011): (a) by plotting ln S versus \nf   and ph?

In \nthis case, ?s can be determined by fitting the plot ph?  (in radians) \nversus f, in the appropriate modulation frequency range, to the \nexpression of phase in Eq. (3.31).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \n\n4.1. Materials and methods \n All rock samples analyzed were parts of slab or broken core and \nfree of any hydrocarbon.

The samples (from oil \nor gas fields) were provided by the Brazilian center for research on \npetroleum, CENPES/Petrobras. In the subsequent chapters we expose a \nshort explanation bearing the experimental procedure and techniques \napplied in the present work.   \n4.1.1. Pulse-decay permeability \n\n Measuring the permeability of tight gas sandstones is a \nchallenging task because standard measuring techniques are generally \nimpractical and difficult to apply. Customary methods of measuring \npermeability in the laboratory are based on steady-state flow. However, \nif the permeability is low, long periods of time are required to establish \nsteady-state flow and thus these procedures are impractical. The \ntransient flow method applied in the present work used nitrogen gas as \nfluid flow from the upstream reservoir through the sample to the \ndownstream reservoir. Thereby the sample permeability could be \ncalculated from the observed pressure decay in the upstream reservoir. \n Pulse decay measurements were carried out using a CoreLab \nPDP-200 pulse decay permeameter, which is ideal for low-permeability \nporous media with intrinsic permeabilities below 0.1 mD. It was built \naccording to the design described by JONES (1997), which is shown in \nFigure 3.3(a) with the two small reservoirs being equal in volume \n(around 5 cm3 each). In this method, the pore volume must be \ndetermined independently so we used the values obtained from the \nN2GA and MICP combination. The PDP-200 software calculates the \npermeability of the sample based on the pressure decay curves. Rock \nsamples of 1.5 inches in diameter and about 1 inch in length were dried \nto a constant weight in an oven at 80 oC before all measurements. The \ngas permeability was measured at net confining stresses representative \nof in-situ conditions, i.e., for each sample originating from distinct \nwells, a distinct confining pressure was applied. A consequence of using \ngas to measure permeability is the gas slip on the solid surface, which \ncreates a deviation from the Poiseuilles flow, known as the Klinkenberg \ncorrection (TIAB and DONALDSON, 2004). The Klinkenberg \npermeability was calculated from multiple measurements at different \nmean pore pressures. The high mean pore pressure reduces the effect of \ngas slippage and reduces the gas compressibility and the magnitude of \nits change with small pressure variations (JONES, 1997). Therefore, it \nshould be as high as practicable. In the experiments reported herein the \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             91 \n\nmaximum mean pore pressures allowed by the PDP transducer used was \n6.89 MPa, only sample A-17V was also tested at 13.10 MPa.  \n4.1.2. Mercury intrusion capillary pressure \n\n The mercury intrusion capillary pressure experiments were \ncarried out with an Autopore IV 9500 by Micromeritics with a pressure \nrange up to 413.69 MPa. The eleven samples analyzed (crushed into \npieces of about 1.4 mesh size) had masses between 3.190 and 8.810 g. \nThe equivalent pore radius was computed according to the capillary \npressure using the Washburn equation with Pw ranging from 0.003 to \n413 MPa, interfacial tension ?Hg = 485 mN/m and wetting angle ?Hg = \n140o. It is of interest to mention that the wetting angle is not a function \nof the material pore size but is an intrinsic property of a solid-fluid \nsystem (ADAMSON, 1990). Values between 130 and 140o are \nconventionally assumed since the cohesive forces between the mercury \natoms are greater than the adhesive forces between mercury and other \nsolids, leading to no relevant changes in the contact angle. Several \nauthors have assumed a mercury contact angle of around 140o \n(ECHEVERR\u00cdA et al., 1999; FAVVAS et al., 2009; SCHL\u00d6MER and \nKROOSS, 1997), and 130o (KAUFMANN et al., 2009). In this study we \nchose the value 140o. \n4.1.3. Nitrogen gas adsorption \n\n Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained at 77 K on an \naccelerated surface area and porosimetry system (ASAP 2020, \nMicromeritics Instruments). The samples were previously crushed into \npieces of about 3 mesh size (mass between 0.89 and 1.72 g), dried in an \noven at 80 oC overnight and outgassed under high vacuum (<10 mmHg) \nfor 10 h at 110 oC on the apparatus. The free space (dead volume of the \ntube) was determined volumetrically using helium before the \nmeasurements were taken for the adsorption isotherm. The saturation \nvapor pressure Po of N2 at 77 K was determined every 120 min. during \nthe experiment using a nitrogen vapor pressure thermometer. An \nequilibration time of 10 s was applied in the analysis. Both adsorption \nand desorption isotherms were measured, although only the adsorption \ndata was used to determine the pore structure information. In addition, \nthe nitrogen statistical film thickness for the BET surface area was \nassessed for relative pressures between 0.021 and 0.203. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n92              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n4.1.4. X-ray diffraction analysis \n\n Sample preparation for XRD analysis was performed by crushing \na fine powder from rock pieces. For finer and controlled particle size \ngrinding we used a swing/disc mill (Spex Shatter Box) commercial \nmachine operating for 3 min. for each sample. According to Buhrke et \nal., (1998) three conditions are necessary to achieve high degrees of \naccuracy in quantitative XRD: total randomness of the crystallite \norientations, sufficient number of crystallites in the experimental \nspecimen to meet statistical requirements, and sufficient diffraction \nintensity measured to satisfy counting statistics. Since we had enough \namount of sample, the reduction of the sample particle size and an \nideally random specimen (in which the probability of orientation for any \nand all Bragg planes is equally likely for any direction in space) were \nobtained. Thus, the samples within particle size smaller than 400-mesh \n(38 ?m) were prepared in a specific XRD sample holder to minimize \npreferred orientation and surface roughness.  \n The XRD measurements were performed in a D4 ENDEAVOR \nequipment from Bruker company coupled by graphite secondary \nmonochromator and Co K-alpha radiation. After being acquired the \nXRD patterns were analyzed using Diffract.Suite EVA Software, for \nsemi-quantitative identification of mineralogical phases. The qualitative \nidentification procedure was to search initially for a mineral that had the \nstrongest peaks, and follows with confirming the choice by finding the \npositions of weaker peaks for the same mineral.  \n4.1.5. Low-field NMR analysis \n\n In this work, one set of low-field NMR experiments was designed \nto study the pore structures, pore types and sizes, porosity and \nparameters for permeability prediction on five tight sandstones from the \nBrazilian gas field named A. The NMR analysis was conducted on five \nmini plugs (~ 7mm x 7mm) of the TGS samples (A-11V, A-12V, A-\n12H, A-17V and A-19V) fully saturated with 10,000 KCl brine in a \nMARAN 23 MHz Ultra Magnetic Resonance Core Analyzer. The \nsamples were kept immersed in the solution under vacuum for more \nthan 48 h and then taken out for pressure-saturation at 3 MPa for another \n96 h. Following that, they were placed in jars full of brine and \ntransferred into the water bath with a temperature of 40 \u00b0C for a \nminimum of 1 or 2 h to be prepared for NMR tests. Each mini plug was \nplaced in a NMR tube coupled in the equipment operating at 23 MHz \nfor the hydrogen nucleus, to obtain the data of spin-spin relaxation time \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             93 \n\ndetermined by CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) technique. The 90\u00b0 \npulse of 10 ?s was calibrated automatically by the software of the \ninstrument. The amplitude of the FID was sampled for 255 data points, \nranging from 0.01 to 5000 ms; the intervals of spin-spin relaxation time \ndetermined by CPMG technique started from 0.5 to 250793 ?s. The \nrelaxation values and relative intensities were obtained by fitting the \nexponential data with the aid of the program. The schematic of the \nexperimental setup of NMR is shown in Figure 4.1. \n\n  \nFigure 4.1: NMR experimental schematic (GAO et al., 2009). \n\n4.1.6. X-ray nano- and microCT \n\n In order to investigate 3D images of tight gas sandstones\u2019 pore \nmicrostructure ranging to sub-micrometers in size, a computer \ntomography (CT) characterization at high resolutions is applied. In the \npresent work this was performed in two microCT (XRadia Versa XRM-\n500) and one nanoCT (XRadia UltraXRM-L200) equipments with \nresolution from 0.7 \u00b5m to 64 nm. Table 4.2 shows the parameters used \nfor the micro- and nanoCT acquisitions in the analyzed tight gas \nsandstones. As one can see, we exposed two TGS samples of field A (A-\n11V and A-17V) to the X-ray CT technique in distinct resolutions. For \nthe experiments we had the criteria of preparing the samples as cylinders \n(to decrease image artifacts) and we chose the diameters to be as big as \npossible (to have enough representative volume) but still permitting \nsufficient X-ray transmission for imaging acquisition (YANG et al., \n2013).

For \neach of the two tight gas sandstones analyzed, a total of 1600 to 2000 \nprojections were taken at equal angular intervals within distinct \nexposure times and source voltage as shown in Table 4.2. It is usual, \nthat, during the microCT image acquisition, noise filters including those \nused to counter various artifacts or image anomalies which can occur \ndue to the reconstruction algorithms and the imaging processing itself \n(NGUYEN, 2011), are applied. However, aiming to obtain a bigger pore \ncontrast no filter was used for the acquisition using the XRadia Versa \nXRM-500 microCT. The samples were glued on a metal extension and \nmounted between the source and the detector including the lenses for \noptical magnification using the clamp for the XRadia Versa XRM-500 \nequipment.

For the XRadia UltraXRM-L200 equipment the sample \npreparation is much more difficult considering the sample size has to be \nvery small and without fractures, therefore, prepared by laser ablation. \n  After experimental conditions were applied allowing the \nacquisition of radiographic projections, the X-ray shadow projections of \nthe measured 3D object are defined as digitalized n x p pixel images. \nThese images are then processed to obtain reconstructed cross-section \nimages of linear attenuation coefficient values using a mathematical \nalgorithm based on the filtered back-projection procedure implemented \nin the used equipment. Thus, a complete stacking of 2D cross-sections \nof the object with a single pixel distance between the slices is obtained, \nresulting in a 3D stack of isotropic voxels with a gray-scale of 16 bits, \nfrom which the 3D internal structure can finally be analyzed.  \n4.1.7. The open photoacoustic cell \n\n Three seal rocks originating from distinct fields and depths were \nanalyzed by photoacoustic spectrometry. The basic requirements of the \nphotoacoustic detection technique can be summarized as (ALMOND \nand PATEL, 1996): \n\n(iii) A light source and focusing instruments; \n(iv) Means of modulation light; \n(v) An appropriate photoacoustic cell itself and;  \n(vi) A microphone and processing electronics. \n\n \nFigure 4.2: Conceptual sketch from a picture of the OPC located at the \n\nLSCM laboratory and used in the analysis. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n96              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n The PAS measurements were performed on a simple Open \nPhotoacoustic Cell (OPC) configuration, as shown in Figure 4.2 with an \naccuracy of thermal diffusivity property of 5%. This configuration \nconsisted of a 250 W quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) lamp and a \nBentham 605 current power supply. After being heat filtered by a water \nlens, the light is mechanically chopped by a Perkin-Elmer chopper, \nmodel 197, and focused onto the sample. As one can see the sample is \nmounted directly onto the front sound inlet of an electret microphone \n(DE LIMA et al., 1992) and sealed by vacuum grease. The output \nvoltage from the microphone was connected to a computer through a \nlock-in amplifier in order to record the amplitude and phase of the PAS \nsignal as functions of the modulation frequency. The experimental setup \nused for the present investigation is calibrated by evaluating the thermal \ndiffusivity of Al powder (Aldrich 99.999 %); the obtained value of \n0.968 \u00b1 0.001 cm2.s-1 agrees well with earlier reported values (PERONI \nand MIRANDA, 1987).  \n In order to compare the thermal diffusivity values and to measure \nporosity in the three analyzed seal rocks, pieces of the rocks sliced \nvertically to the bedding well direction and power compacted discs were \nprepared for the PAS measurements. The vertical sliced samples were \nobtained by dry hand-sanding process, while the compacted discs were \ninitially mechanical powdered (particle size of ~10 ?m) followed by \ncompression using 6 tf/in2 (~90MPa). The powders had controlled \nparticle size grinding using swing/disc mills (Spex Shatter Box) \ncommercial machine operating during 3 min. for each sample. The \nobtained pellets (both sliced and compressed discs) were small with an \naverage diameter of 10 mm. The thicknesses obtained for the vertical \nand powder compressed samples were respectively: 510 ?m and 500 ?m \nfor sample SR-42; 470 ?m and 510 ?m for sample SR-47 and; 390 ?m \nand 475 ?m for sample SR-57. The PAS measurements were taken in \nthe modulation frequency range of 10 to 250 Hz in order to achieve the \nthermally thick regime.

PERMEABILITY MEASUREMENTS AND PORE \nSTRUCTURE CHARACTERIZATION IN TGS  \n\n In this and the following chapters the results obtained by a set of \ntechniques for the pore structure characterization and the analysis of the \npermeability on tight gas sandstones are exposed. By the usage of \ndistinct techniques it was possible to evaluate the benefits and \nlimitations of each method and consequently obtain specific properties \nin these rocks which allow estimate permeability. The main properties \nmeasured in the present chapter for tight gas sandstones originating \nfrom dissimilar gas fields were: porosity, pore size distribution, specific \nsurface area and experimental permeability. Nitrogen Gas Adsorption \n(N2GA), Mercury Intrusion Capillary Pressure (MICP) and Pulse-Decay \nPermeability (PDP) were the techniques applied. On the other hand, \nonly TGS of field A (next Chapter) were evaluated by the usage of Low \nField Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LFNMR), X-ray Nano and Micro \nComputed Tomography, SEM, FESEM and XRD techniques. Also the \nprediction and simulation of permeability were performed and discussed \nfor samples of field A. \n\n5.1. PDP analysis \n In the two actual reservoirs (A and D) investigated in this sub-\nsection the local depositional and tectonic stresses add components of \nstress in distinct directions. Only samples A-12H and A-18H were plugs \nextracted from the horizontal direction to bedding field. Although we \nknew fairly the nature of in situ stresses (net stress) to the vertical \nbedding direction studies here have been performed under distinct \nhydrostatic conditions. The in situ net stress (overburden pressure) value \nfor Field A was equal 27.58 MPa while for Field D it was 25.79 MPa. \nThe time required before the PDP test to reach a uniform pore pressure \non the sample confined in the core holder was about 1 to 2 hour for the \nanalyzed TGS.   \n5.1.1. Effect of TGS rock stress on permeability to gas \n\n Nitrogen gas permeability results for different net pressures at \nconstant high pore pressure (6.89 MPa inlet for all samples and 13.10 \nMPa inlet only for A-17V) are shown in Figure 5.1 for the rocks of well \nA and D. Note that the denominated inlet pressure is the mean pore \npressure performed during PDP tests. In a PDP test the measurement \nspeed is roughly proportional to the mean pore test pressure, and it \nshould be as high as practicable (JONES, 1997), while the net stress is \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             99 \n\nthe difference between the hydrostatic confining pressure and the inlet \npressure applied on the sample located in the core holder.  \n\n \nFigure 5.1: Effect of net stress versus measured k in TGS. All samples were \nmeasured at Pm = 6.89 MPa, A-17V was also analyzed at Pm= 13.10 MPa.     \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n100              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n As one can see in Figure 5.1 for all analyzed samples under \nincreasing net stress values permeability is reduced. Permeability ranges \nfrom about 0.02 mD to less than 0.001 mD at net stress equal 27.58 \nMPa. For sample A-17V the permeability value is reduced as an average \nby 13.4% at 13.10 MPa inlet (mean pore pressure) in comparison to 6.89 \nMPa inlet. All these trends agree that the analyzed TGS have a \nsignificant variation in the permeability values within the applied net \nstress. E.g., considering the calculated fittings of samples A-11V and A-\n17V, the value for permeability at atmospheric pressure (1 atm ? 0.103 \nMPa, and so without the net stress pressure effect) would be \nrespectively in the order of 0.0113 and 0.078 mD. One of the main \ncontrolling parameters for permeability is the pore throat size (REZAEE \net al., 2012). In many cases, the pore/pore throat radius has a greater \neffect than the porosity on the permeability (JAYA et al., 2005; \nRUSHING et al., 2008). Fatt and Davis (1952) observed that tight \nsandstones exhibit a stronger dependence on net stress pressure than \nhigher permeability rocks do. Further, fractures and shale streaks have a \nstrong effect on permeability reductions in tight sands (VAIRIGS et al., \n1971).  \n5.1.2. Klinkenberg\u2019 correction \n\n The TGS samples were tested with 3 to 5 step mean pore \npressures to obtain the Klinkenberg slippage factor and corrections to \ngas permeability. The results are shown in Table 5.1 and Figure 5.2. \nFrom the graphics plotted in Figure 5.2 one can see the agreement to \nequation (2.20) where the apparent gas permeability at low mean pore \npressures is bigger than the Klinkenberg permeability extrapolated to an \ninfinite high mean pore pressure. As one can see we investigated the gas \nslippage effects using the conventional Klinkenberg plot, i.e., the \ninverse mean pore pressure plotted against the apparent gas \npermeability. By fitting the data it was also possible to calculate the \nKlinkenberg slippage factor. Only for samples A-19V and A-12H non-\nDarcy effects may be identified as deviations from the fit line trend at \nhigh mean pressures. However, if we consider the characteristic radius \nfound in A-12H and A-19V being equal 20 and 100 nm (as it will be \nshown later in the PSD results), the nitrogen molecular mean free path \nequal 2.15 nm and apply Eq. (2.19) the values 0.0215 &lt;Kn &lt;0.1075 are \nfound. This range of Knudsen numbers is located in the slip flow regime \nwhere Klinkenberg\u2019 corrections are still valid. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             101 \n\n \nFigure 5.2: Plot of correction for obtaining Klinkenberg permeability where \n\n(1/Pm) tends to zero. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n102              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n Comparing the values of the Klinkenberg\u2019 correction factors \nfound one can observe that in general the values were bigger for field D \nthan for field A. This tendency supported by the Equation (2.21) can \nlead us to the conclusion that samples of field D were probably \ncomprised by significant amount of very small pores, even smaller than \nthe ones found on samples of field A. However we could not confirm \nthis assumption since samples of field D were not available for further \nexperiments realized in this thesis.  \n \n\nTable 5.1: Values of Klinkenberg permeability (ka) and slippage factor \n\nA-11V A-12H A-12V A-17V A-18V A-19V D-32V D-50V\nPermeability, kK \n\n(mD)\n0.0004 0.00066 0.00046 0.0101 0.0005 0.0344 0.0153 0.0064\n\nSlippage factor \nbK\n\n0.0022 0.0004 0.0008 0.0063 0.0005 0.0022 0.0168 0.0131\n\nField D\nSamples\n\nField A\n\nK\nlin\n\nke\nnb\n\ner\ng\n\n \n \n5.1.3. Steady-state versus PDP measurements \n\n In order to evaluate the accuracy of pulse-decay technique \nmeasurements applied in the present work, results of the steady-state \n(permanent method) technique were compared with the unsteady-state \n(pulse-decay or transient method) measurements. Aiming to validate the \ncomparison, each sample was tested with both techniques under the \nsame net stress and using the same gas (nitrogen). For the steady-state \nand unsteady-state measurements, a Core Lab UP-400 (applicable for \nk>0.001 mD) and a Core Lab PDP-200 (for 0.1 mD>k>0.01 ?D) were \nrespectively used. The analyses were performed in four tight gas \nsandstones samples originating from gas fields A or D and in a \ncalibrated pattern made of metal (pattern A). These samples were \nchosen considering their permeability range which does not surpass the \nhigher and lower limit of the transient and permanent technique, \nrespectively. The obtained results are shown in a log-log graphic plotted \nin Figure 5.3 (a) and (b), where all the values represent the absolute \npermeability, i.e. corrected from the Klinkenberg effect. \n Figure 5.3 (a) shows the results for the analyzed samples under \nspecific net stress pressures as described in the graphic. As it can be \nseen in this figure for the investigated samples there is a good agreement \nbetween the two methods within the defined permeability range as \nemphasized by the correlation line (1:1) in the graphic; the higher \ndeviations shown are of samples A-19V and D-32.

Still, this deviation found in our rocks lies within reasonable \nmargins, unlike the results presented in the literature. So have \nRUSHING et al. (2004)  reported a ratio of about 8 for the two methods \n(higher for steady-state method) in the permeability range less than  \n0.01 Md, while CARLES et al.

In this situation we \nobserved in both samples that in the range of higher permeabilities \n(around 0.1 mD) the unsteady-state PDP method tends to underestimate \nthe values. The same happens in the lower ranges of permeabilities \n(around 0.05 mD) where in turn the conventional steady-state method \nunderestimates the values. This is in complete agreement between \nlimitations of each technique within the permeability ranges. As one can \nsee for the middle permeability ranges (Peff =25.79 MPa) the values are \nvery close. Overall we believe that the agreements found between the \ntechniques corroborate that either method provides reasonable results for \nthe permeability range found in the analyzed rocks. \n\n5.2. Results for N2GA and MICP techniques \n\n5.2.1. N2 isotherms \n\n Nitrogen isotherms for selected TGS samples of field A, B and C \nare shown in Figure 5.4. It can be noted that the adsorption-desorption \nprocess is not reversible, as observed by the presence of hysteresis \nloops. Desorption hysteresis is mainly due to the presence of ink-bottle \ntype pores (RUTHVEN, 1984) and is usually explained by pore \nblocking effects (GROEN et al., 2003; RAVIKOVITCH and \nNEIMARK, 2002; SING et al., 1985). Although the eleven rock \nsamples differed in terms of the amount adsorbed and shape of \nhysteresis loops, the N2 isotherms obtained at 77 K were similar and fall \nwithin Type II from the IUPAC classification group (SING et al., 1985). \nAt high relative pressures, the isotherms exhibit high adsorption, an \nindication that the rocks contain macropores not reached by N2GA \nexperiments. At average relative pressures (P/Po > 0.45) the curve \nexhibits a hysteresis loop indicating the multilayer range associated with \ncapillary condensation in mesopores (SING et al., 1985). A feature \ncommon to the hysteresis loops obtained from nitrogen gas adsorption \nmeasurements is this closure point at similar pressures. This lower \nclosure point is attributed to the surface tension of the liquid adsorbate \nreaching an unstable state at a specific pressure, influenced by the nature \nof the adsorbate at a given temperature (ECHEVERR\u00cdA et al., 1999; \nGROEN et al., 2003; SING et al., 1985). For rocks, i.e. a realistic case \nof heterogeneous pore size distribution and interconnected pore system, \nwith this forced closure of the hysteresis loop, the PSD derived from the \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             105 \n\ndesorption branch is often much more affected by pore network effects. \nThus, for PSD calculations only the adsorption branch was considered. \n \n\n \nFigure 5.4: N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms for the TGS rocks of Field \n\nA, B and C obtained at 77 K. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n106              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n As it can be seen in Figure 5.4 the rocks analyzed (a natural \nmaterial) have a porous microstructure in which small and large pores \nare present. Thus, for TGS rocks the horizontal plateau at relative \npressures close to 1 does not occur, as it happens for microporous or \nsynthetic materials with a defined pore range. Additionally, a \nconsiderable increase in the gas condensed in the capillary for a small \nvariation in the relative pressure is observed. TGS rocks from field A \npresent an amount of adsorbed N2 between 3 and 5 cm\n\n3/g (in STP \nconditions) while for field B these values are around 6 cm3/g. For field \nC (outcrop TGS rocks) the amount of adsorbed N2 is very dissimilar \nbetween the samples, varying from 4 to 18 cm3/g. Shapes of hysteresis \nloop are similar for samples belonging to the same field and fall within \nthe type H3, H2 and H4 for fields A, B and C, respectively \n(BRUNAUER et al., 1940; SING et al., 1985). In the type H2 samples, \npores with narrow necks and wider bodies (ink-bottles) can be observed; \ntype H3 is associated with aggregates of plate-like particles giving rise \nto slit-shaped pores (JANSSEN et al., 2011; SING et al., 1985; WANG \net al., 2010; YU et al., 2003) while type H4 loop is often associated with \nnarrow slit-like pores, but in this case the type I isotherm character is \nindicative of microporosity (SING et al., 1985). Nevertheless, for \nnatural materials, such as TGS rocks, this interpretation has to be \nconsidered with caution since it is subject to error. The same caution \nwas recommended by CLARKSON et al.

PSDs from N2GA models \n\n The pore size distributions are calculated using the BJH and \nDollimore-Heal (DH) (DOLLIMORE and HEAL, 1964; DOLLIMORE \nand HEAL, 1970) methods based on the adsorption isotherms data and \nthe more recent DFT method (DO and DO, 2003; LANDERS et al., \n2013) assuming a slit-like pore geometry of carbon as a substrate and N2 \nat 77 K. The calculations were performed using ASAP 2020 Software \n(ASAP 2020, 2007). The PSDs curves of cumulative pore volume \nmeasured using the three models are shown in Figure 5.5, with left \ncolumn showing results for samples of field A and right column results \nfrom fields B and C.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             107 \n\n \nFigure 5.5: Cumulative pore volumes measured from N2GA isotherms \n\nusing BJH, Dollimore-Heal and DFT models. \n \n\n From the results shown in Figure 5.5, in all analyzed samples it is \npossible to observe more differences in the PSDs curves obtained by the \nDFT model, while BJH and Dollimore-Head are very similar. Recently, \nLANDERS et al. (2013) published an extensive review on the \nadsorption characterization of mesoporous and microporous materials \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n108              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nby using the density functional theory (DFT) methods. As they stated in \ntheir work, the DFT methods have found numerous applications for \ncalculating pore size distributions in traditional and newly discovered \nnanoporous solids. All materials discussed in that work were either H1 \nor H2 hysteresis type, within a defined pore range size in the micro- or \nmesoporous region. In summary, for the TGS analyzed rocks analyzed \nin our work we observed that the pore volumes tend to be \nunderestimated when performing the DFT model, especially for the \nfields B and C. On the other hand the fact that BJH and Dollimere-Heal \nmodels are based on the Kelvin equation leads to the similarity of \ncalculated cumulative volumes curves between these models.  \nNevertheless we only choose the BJH results to perform the PSD using \nthe N2GA and MICP combination, as it will be discussed in sub-chapter \n5.2.4.   \n \n\n5.2.3. PSDs from MICP \n\n Figure 5.6 and Figure 5.7 depict the PSD curves for the \ncumulative and incremental pore volumes obtained by the Washburn \nequation (3.11). The porosity conversion is displayed in Table 5.2. As \none can see, in the three analyzed fields, the samples showed a \nsignificant variation in the cumulative porosity while incremental PSD \ncurves are mainly bimodal with peaks differing by at least one decimal \norder. For lower porosity samples the mean PSD tends to be around 100 \nAngstroms while for the others it is around 1000\u201310000 \u00c5 (fields A and \nB) unlike the outcrop samples (field C). E.g., sample C-51 practically \nhas all pores concentrated in the region of about 100 \u00c5. An interesting \nbehavior to be observed for the MICP incremental curve is in sample C-\n63: even for the lower pore sizes it was not possible to measure a \nconsiderable amount of porosity. In this case the usage of N2GA is of \nmore use, as it will be observed in the combination of N2GA and MICP \ntechniques for PSD results.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             109 \n\n \nFigure 5.6: Incremental pore volumes versus pore throat size obtained by \n\nMICP technique. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n110              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 5.7: Cumulative pore volumes versus pore throat size obtained by \n\nMICP technique. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             111 \n\n5.2.4.

For this reason we combined N2GA, ideal for micro- and \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n112              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nmesoporous materials (GROEN et al., 2003), and MICP, one of the \nmost used technique in measuring PSD in the range of meso- and \nmacropores, to investigate the total pore spectrum in the studied TGS. \nThe approach chosen follows the ideas exposed by a differential \ncombination of the N2GA and MICP cumulative curves to find at which \npore size the techniques should be connected (point of connection \u2013 \nPOC) as described in detail elsewhere (SCHMITT et al., 2013) when \nstuding seal rocks. Such approach is for the first time used in tight gas \nsandstones reservoirs.  \n Having for each rock sample the cumulative pore volume \ndistribution for N2GA obtained by BJH model (Figure 5.5) and MICP \nobtained by Washburn equation (Figure 5.7), the intersection between \nthe curves of the first derivative (POC) are obtained where the fluid \nvariation (volume) is the same for both techniques. After calculating a \ndefined POC value for each sample, thus, the sum of total pore volumes \nstarting from the incremental volumes measured in the smaller pores, \ni.e., the volumes measured by the N2GA technique are continued above \nthe POC by those calculated using the MICP technique. Figure 5.9, \nFigure 5.10 and Figure 5.11 show the results for samples of field A, B \nand C with total incremental pore volumes, f(x), and cumulative porosity \nplotted against the pore size diameter. Note that both the incremental \nand cumulative pore volumes have been multiplied by the apparent \ndensity values determined by MICP. From these figures it is possible to \nsee that field C (an outcrop) is comprised by considerable amount of \nmicro- and mesopores detected by N2GA technique, though porosity \nvalues and the peaks of incremental PSD curves between the three \nsamples do not necessarily match; the same was also observed for \nsamples B-36 and B-43 of field B. On the other hand for samples of \nfield A very little porosity in the micro- and mesopore range was \nidentified, practically all pore spectrum was already detected by MICP \nanalysis. In summary, for all samples the total cumulative curves (white \nfill) have nonlinear curvatures of the convex type, with less \naugmentation at the upper extremes, showing that TGS rocks analyzed \nhave predominantly small pore sizes and also that there are no larger \npores outside the pore size range studied by N2GA and MICP. The \nresults for the complete pore size distributions and also the ones \nobtained separately applying the two techniques are given in Table 5.2. \nThe specific surface area results are discussed in the next chapter. \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             113 \n\nTable 5.2: Structural pore parameters obtained for TGS rocks. \n\n \n \n\nM\net\n\nho\nd\n\nSa\nm\n\npl\ne\n\nM\nas\n\ns \n(g\n\n)\nR\n\nea\nl d\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n \n\n(g\n/c\n\nm\n3 )\n\nV\npo\n\nre\n \n\n(c\nm\n\n3 /\ng)\n\nP\nor\n\nos\nit\n\ny \n(%\n\n)\nM\n\nas\ns \n\n(g\n)\n\nV\npo\n\nre\n \n\n(c\nm\n\n3 /\ng)\n\nP\nor\n\nos\nit\n\ny \n(%\n\n)\nB\n\nE\nT\n\n S\no \n\n(m\n2 /\n\ng)\nP\n\nO\nC\n\n \n(\u00c5\n\n)\nT\n\not\nal\n\n V\npo\n\nre\n \n\n(c\nm\n\n3 /\ng)\n\nT\not\n\nal\n P\n\nor\nos\n\nit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\nA\n-1\n\n1V\n4.\n\n09\n2.\n\n66\n0.\n\n02\n32\n\n6.\n17\n\n1.\n36\n\n0.\n00\n\n43\n1.\n\n14\n0.\n\n76\n76\n\n0.\n02\n\n36\n6.\n\n28\nA\n\n-1\n2H\n\n5.\n67\n\n2.\n61\n\n0.\n02\n\n12\n5.\n\n54\n1.\n\n75\n0.\n\n00\n44\n\n1.\n16\n\n0.\n84\n\n40\n0.\n\n02\n09\n\n5.\n45\n\nA\n-1\n\n2V\n5.\n\n79\n2.\n\n60\n0.\n\n02\n38\n\n6.\n18\n\n1.\n15\n\n0.\n00\n\n44\n1.\n\n14\n0.\n\n75\n29\n\n0.\n02\n\n35\n6.\n\n12\nA\n\n-1\n7V\n\n3.\n98\n\n2.\n65\n\n0.\n04\n\n51\n11\n\n.9\n6\n\n1.\n39\n\n0.\n00\n\n56\n1.\n\n49\n1.\n\n00\n30\n\n0.\n04\n\n51\n11\n\n.9\n6\n\nA\n-1\n\n9V\n3.\n\n19\n2.\n\n41\n0.\n\n04\n48\n\n10\n.8\n\n0\n1.\n\n00\n0.\n\n00\n54\n\n1.\n30\n\n1.\n57\n\n40\n0.\n\n04\n53\n\n10\n.9\n\n1\nB\n\n-3\n6\n\n5.\n95\n\n2.\n56\n\n0.\n02\n\n20\n5.\n\n63\n1.\n\n47\n0.\n\n00\n79\n\n2.\n01\n\n2.\n12\n\n50\n0.\n\n02\n51\n\n6.\n41\n\nB\n-4\n\n3\n3.\n\n80\n2.\n\n65\n0.\n\n01\n10\n\n2.\n90\n\n0.\n89\n\n0.\n00\n\n84\n2.\n\n22\n2.\n\n20\n36\n\n0.\n01\n\n14\n3.\n\n03\nB\n\n-4\n8\n\n5.\n59\n\n2.\n45\n\n0.\n03\n\n50\n8.\n\n57\n1.\n\n22\n0.\n\n00\n72\n\n1.\n76\n\n1.\n60\n\n36\n0.\n\n03\n55\n\n8.\n69\n\nC\n-5\n\n1\n6.\n\n96\n2.\n\n34\n0.\n\n04\n76\n\n11\n.1\n\n3\n1.\n\n04\n0.\n\n02\n67\n\n6.\n25\n\n11\n.6\n\n5\n51\n\n0.\n05\n\n05\n11\n\n.8\n1\n\nC\n-6\n\n3\n8.\n\n81\n2.\n\n66\n0.\n\n00\n42\n\n1.\n12\n\n1.\n72\n\n0.\n00\n\n80\n2.\n\n13\n4.\n\n93\n82\n\n0.\n00\n\n73\n1.\n\n94\nC\n\n-6\n9\n\n6.\n59\n\n2.\n48\n\n0.\n02\n\n05\n5.\n\n07\n1.\n\n17\n0.\n\n01\n91\n\n4.\n72\n\n8.\n51\n\n60\n0.\n\n02\n32\n\n5.\n76\n\nM\nIC\n\nP\nN\n\n2G\nA\n\nC\nom\n\nbi\nna\n\nti\non\n\n (N\n2G\n\nA\n +\n\n M\nIC\n\nP\n)\n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n114              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 5.9: Curves of total PSD for field A: N2GA+MICP combination. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             115 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nFigure 5.10: Curves of total PSD for field B: N2GA+MICP combination. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n116              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 5.11: Curves of total PSD for field C: N2GA+MICP combination. \n\n5.2.5. Specific surface area results \n\n Poiseuilles\u2019s and Carman-Kozeny\u2019s equations showed that \npermeability is a function of porosity, pore/pore-throat radius, surface \narea, and tortuosity (JAYA et al., 2005; ZHANG, 2011). In many cases, \nthe pore/pore throat radius has a greater effect than the porosity on the \npermeability (JAYA et al., 2005; RUSHING et al., 2008). Also the \nspecific surface area is a property that characterizes the connectivity of \nthe pore space and is therefore considered as one of the main factors \naffecting the permeability of soils and sedimentary rocks (ESEME et al., \n2012). Furthermore, the presence of pore-lining and/or pore-bridging \nclays in the rocks may reduce the permeability significantly by affecting \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             117 \n\nthe pore/pore throat radius and surface area (JAYA et al., 2005). The \nresults for the specific surface area (m2/g) measured for TGS rocks of \nfield A, B and C are illustrated in Figure 5.12. This figure depicts the \nmeasurements from the N2GA data for the specific surface area \ncalculated using the two models BET and Langmuir in ASAP 2020 \nSoftware. The Langmuir model leads to higher surface areas in all \nanalyzed samples. This fact is expected because the Langmuir theory is \nbetter at describing microporous materials exhibiting Type I isotherms \n(SING et al., 1985 classification) and so assumes adsorption limited to \none monolayer. However as shown in Figure 5.4, most of the analyzed \nTGS samples are Type II (though with hysteresis loop) isotherms. \n The adsorption analysis was carried out applying the BET and \nLangmuir equations for low relative pressures (0.051 &lt;P/Po &lt;0.22). \nThis range was defined considering the linearity restricted to a limited \npart of the isotherm, usually not outside the P/Po range of 0.05-0.30 \n(BRUNAUER et al., 1938; GREGG and SING, 1982) required for \nsolving the mathematical approach on BET and Langmuir equations.  \n  \n\n \nFigure 5.12: Surface area results using BET and Langmuir models. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n118              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n6. PORE STRUCTURE CHARACTERIZATION, MULTI-\nSCALE 3D X-RAY TOMOGRAPHY AND PERMEABILITY \nPREDICTIONS \n\n In this chapter we performed a study to obtain pore structure \nparameters using low-field NMR and 3D X-ray tomography where the \nPSD results were compared with those from the N2GA and MICP \ncombination. Also, the measured pore structure parameters obtained by \nthe applied techniques were correlated to empirical models to estimate \nor simulate permeability. Only the samples of field A were analyzed in \nthis chapter. The TGS samples of field B, C and D were not available to \nthe further analyses. \n\n6.1. Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis \n The NMR measurements can provide information about the pore \nstructure, the amount of fluid in-situ and interactions between the pore \nfluids and surface of pores, as numerous authors have explored the link \nbetween NMR measurements and petrophysical properties. In this sub-\nchapter the results of laboratory low-field NMR measurements \nperformed in mini core samples of TGS rocks will be displayed and \nevaluated. Within these results it was possible to obtain the total \nporosity and correlated the relaxation time distribution to the pore size \ndistribution. Besides, the identication of the specific pore types on each \nsample and the measurement of irreductible bulk volume (BVI) and free \nfluid index (FFI) regions to find T2cutoff and T2gm values were performed \nto estimate the absolute permeability. \n6.1.1. Acquired transverse relaxation curves \n\n Each low-field NMR measurement yields a T2 spectrum at \nsaturated samples and these T2 spectra are shown in Figure 6.1. \nTypically T2 spectra for sandstones present unimodal (COATES et al., \n1999) or bimodal (HODGKINS and HOWARD, 1999; LIANG et al., \n2013) distributions; also REZAEE et al., (2012) working with tight gas \nsandstones found a bimodal distribution with main T2 times appearing as \nmajor dominant peak at T2 about 1.0 ms and a minor tail distribution of \nT2 in larger times around 10 to 40 ms, corresponding to the larger pores. \nYAO et al., (2010) studding coals observed commonly three peaks for \nthe analyzed samples. HABER et al. (2010) obtained for fine sand soil a \nbimodal distribution and for two silt loams soils multimodal \ndistributions. They attibute this differences to the textural composition \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             119 \n\nof each sample observing that with increasing silt and clay content, the \nT2 relaxation times desreased significantly.  \n \n \n\n \nFigure 6.1: Amplitude normalized for transverse relaxation time (T2) \n\nobtained with the NMR measurements in the five TGS of well A.  \n\n In the present work, as it can be seen in Figure 6.1 the analyzed \nTGS shown four peaks for the transverse relaxation T2 distribution, \nstrongly related to the pore structure and microestructure of analyzed \nTGS. From the PSD curves obtained by the N2GA+MICP combination \nit was already possible to know that the samples to be analyzed by low-\nfield NMR were comprised by relatively small pore sizes (~ 100 \u2013 5000 \n\u00c5) and low porosities (~ 6 \u2013 12%), while textural aspects related to the \nmineralogy will be discussed in section 6.3. Mini cylinders of about \n7mm x 7mm diameter and length were manufactured and considered \nrepresentative enough  to the low-field NMR analysis. The tests were \nperformed in a 23 MHz Spectrometer having a 10 mm NMR tube and \nvery low intervals of spin-spin relaxation time (starting from 0.5 to \n250793 ?s), also high number of scans (255), just large enough to span \nall of the resonance lines in the spectrum. For more details see section \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n120              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n3.7.3. The low-field NMR results gladdened that for the five TGS \nanalyzed we observed four T2 spectrum peaks identified by the \nrelaxation time at 0.71\u20131.5 ms, 3.86\u201313.91 ms, 11.90\u201327.10 ms and \n232.47\u2013590.07. These peaks correspond to pores&lt;0.1 \u00b5m,&lt;0.5 \u00b5m,&lt;2 \n\u00b5m and >2 \u00b5m, as it will be discussed in the next sub-chapter \nconsidering the results obtained from the N2GA+MICP combination, \nand later also compared with the multi-scale tomography.  \n Figure 6.2 illustrates the difference of pore structures among the \nsamples of Field A. In (a) one can see that the locations of each specific \npore types (component) are very similar in all samples, while judging by \nthe contribution in percentage of the components it is very distinct \nbetween the samples located in the upper regions (A-11V, A-12H and \nA-12V)  from the ones located in the lower regions (A-17V and A-19V) \nof field A. \n\n     \nFigure 6.2: Pore component location (a) and contribution (b) identified \n\nfrom low-field NMR measurements in TGS of well A. \n\n Low-field NMR analysis confirms the major pore size in samples \nA-11V, A-12H and A-12V occurring at about 1.0 ms. This amount of \nporosity for these samples is about 60-80% as shown in Figure 6.2(b), \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             121 \n\nand it is considered to be the clay bound water content, which is much \nhigher than for samples A-17V and A-19V (30-40%). Clay volume in \nhomogeneous reservoir rocks can be estimated by conventional \nmethods; however, a mixture of clay minerals, quartz, and calcite \noccurring in TGS notably complicates the interpretation making the \nusage of advanced techniques such as low-field NMR necessary. \nComparing T2 distribution of analyzed TGS, it can be seen that larger T2 \ntimes are present only in A-17V and A-19V due to the lack of the \nmacropores in the other three samples where only minor peaks or a tail \ndistribution of T2 around 10 to 200 ms were found. From T2 spectrum of \nsamples A-17V and A-19V one can assume that the proportion of \nmacropore components is dominating. Based on these experimental \nresults we can conclude that samples from upper regions in the analyzed \nfield contain less volumes of pores responsible to the flow fluid in the \nreservoir (bound-fluid porosity), consequently lower permeability values \nare also expected,  as it will be verified and discussed later. As a rule, \nthe T2 transverse relaxation time from rocks of field A reaches from 0.71 \nto 590 ms characterizing a spectrum which proved to be tetramodal. The \nmeasured NMR signals correlation to the pore size distributions are \nexposed as follows. \n6.1.2. Surface relaxivity for PSD results \n\n As exposed in Eq. (3.24) the measured T2 values are a function of \nthe surface to volume ratio (S/V) and the surface relaxivity (?2) of the \nanalyzed material. The value of ?2 can be estimated by comparing the \nNMR signal to the MICP curves (HOSSAIN et al., 2011; REZAEE et \nal., 2012). While studying petrophysical properties of greensand, \nHOSSAIN et al. (2011) found a conversion value for T2 time signal of \n20.4 ?m/s and 28.4 ?m/s for two distinct formations to generate Pc \ncurves from NMR measurements; MARSCHALL et al. (1995), \ninvestigating carbonate rocks, arrived at a value between 4-20 ?m/s \nwhile for sandstones it was between 7.92-25.1 ?m/s. SONDERGELD et \nal. (2010), analyzing shale rocks, came across a surface relaxivity \nconversion of 50 ?m/s and found consistent results of body pore sizes \ndistribution with SEM observations. In our study, we used the pore size \ndistribution curves obtained by the N2GA+MICP combination to fit the \nlow-field NMR T2 distributions. The best fitting was reached using a \nvalue of surface relaxivity equaling 30 ?m/s applied for the five \nanalyzed TGS rocks. One can compare the PSD results for low-field \nNMR (Figure 6.3) and the N2GA+MICP combination (Figure 6.4). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n122              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 6.3: PSD of TGS field A measured by Low-field NMR T2 signal: (a) \n\nincremental curves and (cumulative) curves. \n\n \nFigure 6.4: PSD of TGS field A measured by N2GA+MICP combination: \n\n(a) incremental curves and (cumulative) curves. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             123 \n\nIn Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.4 (a) refers to the incremental pore volumes \nwhile (b) is the cumulative porosity where a good match was found \nbetween the NMR and N2GA+MICP curves and porosity values. \nNaturally, when comparing the incremental PSD curves one can see that \neven though the spectrum\u2019s range of pore sizes is very analogous (e.g.  \nfrom 0.004 to 4 ?m in samples A-11V, A-17V and A-19V), the peaks \ntend to be distinct between both techniques: mainly tetramodal for low-\nfield NMR measurements and bimodal for N2GA+MICP results. This \nbehavior can be explained pondering the principles of each technique as \ndiscussed in the next paragraph. \n According to the Washburn and BJH equations utilized for the \nMICP and N2GA data calculation, at each recorded pressure a volume of \nfluid is determined and converted into a cylindrical pore volume with a \nradius n. On the other hand, the connection between NMR \nmeasurements and petrophysical parameters stems from the strong effect \nthat the rock surface has in promoting magnetic decay of saturating \nfluids. Therefore, T2 is directly proportional to the pore size with the \nassociated signal amplitude being the sum of the signal amplitudes \narising from the fluid (hydrogen atoms in our case) in individual pores. \nThus, the measured NMR porosity depends only on the fluid saturating \nthe analyzed sample and it is the sum of connected and unconnected \nporosities. The PSD curves obtained from the N2GA+MICP \ncombination (Figure 6.4) are mainly comprised by pore ranges \nmeasured by MICP techniques, see sub-chapter 5.2.4, Figure 5.9 and \nTable 5.2. In a MICP experiment, the effective pore throat radius is \ncalculated from the Hg injection pressure, and the injected Hg volume \ngives the corresponding volume of pores that can be accessed by that \nlevel of capillary pressure (or less). In this manner, Hg injection is really \ngiving a pore throat size distribution, but at each limiting pore throat \nsize, the actual volume of Hg that enters the sample is the volume of all \nassociated larger pore bodies and pore throats (ink-bottle effect). It is \ngenerally thought that, from the original deposition environment and the \ndiagenesis processes influencing the development of the rocks which \nwill establish a reservoir, there will be a strong relationship between the \nexistence of pore bodies and pore throats. A textural and structural \nevaluation in the five TGS rocks of field A will be done further in sub-\nchapter 6.3, as well as the quantification of pore bodies and pore throats \nusing nano- and microCT (Figure 6.20 and Figure 6.21 \u201cb\u201d left side).   \nAs a consequence, MICP experiments performed in rocks having such a \nhigh amount of ink-bottle pore types will bring this influence in the \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n124              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nresults, whereas NMR measurements do not bring this effect turning to \nbe an effective reliable method for obtaining PSD curves having both \nopened (connected) and closed porosity. \n6.1.3. Measuring T2cutoff and T2gm for permeability predictions \n\n In section 2.5.3 it was stated that to predict the permeability from \nNMR results using Coates model, Eq. (2.31), and Mean-T2 model, Eq. \n(2.32), the values of T2cutoff and T2gm need to be calculated. To obtain the \nT2gm in the present work we consider merely the mean value under the \nT2 signal distributions. As a result, the free fluid index (FFI) and \nirreductible bulk volume (BVI) have roughly the same values. \nProgressing, to obtain the T2cutoff value, various works have been \nreported in the literature. E.g., SONDERGELD et al. (2010), studying \nshale rocks, found most of the signal in the T2 distribution occurring \nbelow the 3 ms cutoff for \u201cclay bound\u201d water (or simple FFI). \nMARSHALL et al. (1995) reported that a typical value for T2cutoff in \nsandstones is 33 ms and that the cutoff T2 correlates with rock type as \ndefined by lithology and, especially, by the well of origin. HOSSAIN et \nal. (2011) defined T2cutoff as the relaxation time at the point where the \ncumulative porosity of the fully saturated sample equals the irreducible \nwater saturation. So the cumulative porosity over the range T2>T2cutoff \nwas the macro-porosity and below the range T2<T2cutoff was the micro-\nporosity with T2cutoff equal 3.68 ms and 5.21 ms for two distinct \ngreensand formations. Since we performed low-field NMR only for \ncleaned samples 100% saturated with 10% KCl brine, our task was to \ndefine the region representing the clay bond water, which defines de FFI \nand BVI regions in our samples. As already discussed in section 6.1.1 \nwe considered the first peak in the lower relaxation times as being the \nBVI volume whereas the values to the higher relaxation times were \nconsidered to be the FFI volumes. Succeeding, the FFI and BVI values \nwere parameters employed to predict permeability using the COATES et \nal. (1999) model. Table 6.1 shows the obtained T2gm and T2cutoff and \nrespective FFI and BVI values for the five TGS of well A. All these \nparameters were used to predict permeability which will be also \ncompared with the experimental PDP permeability, as will discussed in \nsub-chapter 6.4.1. The proceeding on choosing the T2gm and T2cutoff \nvalues for samples A-12V, A-12H and A-17V is shown in Figure 6.5. \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             125 \n\nTable 6.1: Parameters obtained after defining T2gm and T2cutoff.  \n\nT2 (ms) FFI BVI T2 (ms) FFI BVI T2 (ms) FFI BVI\nA-11V 1.63 9.33E+04 9.56E+04 33.90 2.51E+04 1.59E+05 3.53 4.88E+04 1.35E+05\n\nA-12H 1.26 8.19E+04 7.85E+04 33.90 1.34E+04 1.41E+05 2.59 2.50E+04 1.29E+05\n\nA-12V 1.47 8.51E+04 8.38E+04 33.90 1.78E+04 1.45E+05 3.02 2.98E+04 1.33E+05\n\nA-17V 9.87 9.25E+04 9.19E+04 33.90 5.69E+04 1.28E+05 4.80 1.09E+05 7.43E+04\n\nA-19V 20.31 1.13E+05 1.11E+05 33.90 9.68E+04 1.27E+05 5.06 1.52E+05 7.02E+04\n\nSamples\n\nT 2gm T 2cutoff\nGeometric mean values for \n\nTGS field A\nFrom literature in sandstones Measured for TGS field A\n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.5: Defined T2gm and T2cutoff values for samples A-12V, A-12H and \n\nA-17V.

Results for the 3D X-ray nano- and microCT \n The 3D high definition analyses were performed for two TGS \nsamples of field A using nano- and microCT techniques. Figure 6.6 \nshows the analyzed samples and one projection of all acquired images. \nThe criteria to choose samples A-11V and A-17V were based on the \nporosity and pore size range: as we want to evaluate (in three \ndimensions) the differences on the pore structures of low permeability \nTGS of field A, we decided to take samples showing as much as \npossible distinct PSD and porosity values, though having pore size \nranges comprised in the resolution of the used X-ray CT equipment. \n \n\n \nFigure 6.6: Macro and CT images of TGS A-11V and A-17V. Cores of 3.5 \ncm x 3.5 cm were used for extraction of the smaller specimens: 7 mm x 7 \nmm for microCT analysis of 2000 projections and 0.7 ?m res. (a); 2 mm x \n2mm for microCT analysis of 1600 projections and 0.3 ?m res. (b) and 0.1 \nmm x 0.1 mm for nanoCT analysis of 1600 projections and 0.064 ?m res. \n(c). The reconstructed CT slices (a, b and c) show the distribution of the \nsolid and void structures present in the TGS with black being the pores. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             127 \n\n The main 3D pore structure information aimed at was: porosity, \npore size distribution, pore shape and tortuosity, connectivity, \norientation and specific surface area. Having the porosity and PSD \ncurves obtained from the combination of N2GA and MICP techniques, \nas exposed in Figure 5.9, we selected then samples A-11V and A-17V \nfor the nano- and microCT analyses. Figure 6.6 shows the macro and \nmicro images of samples A-11V (left column) and A-17V (right \ncolumn). In this figure it is possible to see (i) the original core samples \nfrom were pulse-decay permeability analyses were performed and slices \nfor extraction of sub-samples were cut; (ii) mini core samples used for \nmicroCT acquisition and (iii) ultra mini core samples used for nanoCT \nanalysis. (a), (b) and (c) are X-ray CT reconstructed slices for Res1, \nRes2 and Res3, with pixel sizes exposed in Table 4.2. From the image \n(c) acquired with the nanotomography, it is possible to see for both \nrocks the presence of spheric and unconnected pores located inside of \nthe matrix grains. \n6.2.1. 3D image processing and segmentation \n\n The key for capturing image features that are relevant for \nsimulations is good image segmentation. Because we are interested \nmainly in the pore structure analysis, the filters to remove impulse noise \nwere applied based on pore phase segmentation. A filter transforms an \nimage to emphasize or stress a specific feature of its structure (AVIZO, \n2012). Filtering techniques are often useful to extract desired \ninformation from input data or simply to improve the appearance of the \ninput data. Considering that our interest is related mainly with the study \nof pore morphology and pore sizes ranging below the micrometer \nresolution, we need the application of an ideal filter to remove the noise \nfrom the acquired 3D images and to enhance contrast between solid and \nvoids. A common problem in filtering theory is to estimate a signal \nmixed with noise. Usually a solution is the moving average, where the \nvalue of each pixel is replaced by the average of its neighbors. This is \nbased on the assumption that short ranged variations result from noise so \nthe filtered output can then be viewed as the main trend of the function \n(ZHANG, et al., 2013; AVIZO, 2012).  \n For all acquired resolutions using X-ray nano- and microCT, the \nNon-Local Means (NLM) filter was the best choice for the 3D image \npre-processing. The NLM filter replaces a considered pixel by the \nweighted mean of all the pixels in the whole image or the surrounding \nneighborhoods (ZHANG, et al., 2013). Only for Res1 (in both samples \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n128              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nA-11V and A-17V) two additional filters were performed in the \nfollowing order: non-local means (NLM) ? Despeckle ? Median. For \na better understanding on the theory and applications concerning to the \nNLM, Despeckle and Median filtering algorithms, see the related \nliterature (LOIZOU and PATTCHIS, 2008; DANDEKAR, 2008; \nIQBAL et al., 2013; ZHANG et al., 2013). Figure 6.7 shows the usage \nof additional filters in 3D images of sample A-17V Res1. \n \n\n \nFigure 6.7: Distinct filters used in the pre-processing of the 3D image \nacquired for sample A-17V in the Res 1. The value of histogram-based \n\nthresholding for the pore segmentation was 130 for both (a) and (b). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             129 \n\n Considerable efforts were taken on finding the best sequence of \nfilters in the pre-processing analysis of Res1, since the acquired images \nwere comprised of very small artifacts corrupting an accurate \nsegmentation even after applying the NLM filter. As one can see in \nFigure 6.7 (a) the black spots on the segmentation process are identified \nas mismatch pores, which are in truth image noise. Both (a) and (b) pore \nsegmentations were done using the same value of histogram-based \nthresholding at the 16 bits image. In (a) the data set shows results of \nsuper-estimated pore segmentation inside of grains while in (b) the data \nset shows less noise. We believe that the main reasons for the \noccurrence of very small artifacts on 3D images of Res1 are related to \nthe usage of such a high voltage energy (80 keV) and to the sample size \n(7 mm2) which might have been still too big for resolution of 0.7 ?m.  \n After choosing an adequate filter, among a wide range of \ntechniques we used histogram-based iterative thresholding to reach a \nbest-fit segmentation. Thresholding becomes a simple but effective tool \nto separate objects from the gray levels of the pixels belonging to the \nbackground where the gray-level samples are clustered in two parts as \nbackground and foreground (object), or alternately are modeled as a \nmixture of two Gaussians (SEZGIN and SANKUR, 2004). The \nforeground is represented by gray-level 0, that is, black and the \nbackground by the highest luminance is 255 in 8-bit images. The output \nof the thresholding operation is a binary image from which the rock pore \nstructure can be extracted, quantified and simulated. All filtering and \nthresholding steps were executed using Avizo 7.1 Software. The quality \ncontrol taken during the segmentation process was based on the \nhistogram-based thresholding, 2D and 3D pore segmentation views as \nshown in Figure 6.8.  \n\n \nFigure 6.8: Thresholding histogram, 3D and 2D views displayed during the \n\npore segmentation for sample A-11V, using Avizo Software. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n130              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n6.2.2.

Also, the connectivity of the pores, thickness of the \nnetwork, and the effect of pore blockage can be observed from the pore-\nnetwork extraction. There are innumerous theories and methods \nconcerning the pore-network extraction to understand porous materials \nbehaviors, based on adsorption concepts (CAI et al., 2007) or on micro-\ncomputerized-tomography images (DONG and BLUNT, 2009). In the \npresent work topological and equivalent resistor network (skeleton) \nmethods were performed for the segmented pore-network, extracted \nusing Avizo Software. For the three acquired resolutions both figures \n(Figure 6.9 and Figure 6.10) show the 3D microstructure images (a) and \nthe 3D topological pore structure (b). As already explained above for all \ninvestigated resolutions the reconstructed 3D images were optimized by \nremoving impulse noise through the application of filtering procedures, \nfollowed by thresholding, segmentation, pore morphology extraction \nand finally quantification analyses.  \n From the extraction of the segmented 3D pore structure based in \na gray level histogram (Figure 6.9(b) and Figure 6.10(b)), as one can \nsee, depending on the pixel resolution taken for the X-ray Nano- and \nMicroCT acquisition and also on the nature of the sample\u2019s pore system, \nthe pore structure can be comprised of a connected or unconnected pore \nnetwork. In these figures connected pores share a unique color while \nunconnected pores have distinct colors. For sample A-11V, e. g., only in \nRes2 it was possible to observe a connected pore network which \nrepresents 97.53% of the pore phase. On the other hand for sample A-\n17V the connected pore network could be observed in all resolutions \nand it represents for Res1, Res2 and Res3, respectively, 96.78%, \n96.24% and 98.80% of the porosity measured in each resolution. The \nconnected network observed for A-17V in Res1 and Res2 can be \nexplained considering that this sample is constituted by a higher amount \nof pores bigger in body and throat sizes therefore a smaller resolution \n(Res1) was already able to detect the entire network while not detecting \nthe connections in sample A-11V. Whereas for Res3, since the size of \nthe samples to be analyzed ranges in the order of 100 ?m in length and \neven smaller in diameter, it makes it hard to draw any conclusion about \nthe pore network; a single pore can already make up a good portion of \nthe sample, as it happened in sample A-17V, compare Figure 6.10(b). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             133 \n\n6.2.2.1. Generating 3D sub-samples \n\n Intending to extract the statistical information from the pore \nnetwork, i. e. pore size distribution (frequency and volume) and \ncoordination number, it is necessary to separate the pore bodies from \ntheir throats. There are different methods that have been presented in the \nliterature to fulfill this task. In this work we initially tried to apply the \nwatershed algorithm, a tool belonging to the Avizo Fire Software. As it \nwill be discussed in the next section, we did not obtain good results for \nthe analyzed samples, leading us to choose other methods: \n\n(vii) Mathematical morphology using Imago 2.3.40 Software \n(IMAGO), see related theory (MARQUES FILHO and \nVIEIRA NETO, 1999; HAI et al., 2001; MOREIRA; \n2013); \n\n(viii) Generation of an equivalent resistor network (skeleton) \nusing C3DE Software (CUNHA, 2012). \n\nFor this task we choose for each resolution one region of interest (ROI) \nto be analyzed considering the criteria that (i) for the pore size \ndistribution analysis we intended to investigate the same amount of \npixels in all resolutions measured in each sample (and as big as \npossible), and (ii) the softwares used to generate the 3D images for the \nmathematical morphology and skeleton only accepts cubic shapes with \nidentical x, y and z axis.   \n \n\n \nFigure 6.11: Representative cross-section through reconstructed A-11V and \nA-17V porous media with white representing the pore phase and x=y (?m) \nalike respectively: 453.3 and 448 (Res1); 210 and 186 (Res2); 38.4 (Res3). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n134              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n In this matter, the three resolutions of samples A-11V and A-17V \nanalyzed by X-ray Nano- and MicroCT are constituted by a fixed \namount of pixels (600 x 600 x 600) therefore varying in size with a \ndissimilar investigated portion of the sample volume. Figure 6.11 shows \nthe 2D cross-sections for each generated sub-sample for the three \nresolutions chosen and named as Res1, Res2 and Res3. As laid out \nbefore in Table 4.2 the three resolutions are just slightly different for \nSample A-11V and A-17V. For sample A-11V, e. g., Res1 shows a pixel \nsize of 0.75 ?m investigating a volume of  9.11E+07 ?m3; Res2 displays \na pixel size of 0.35 ?m and a volume of 9.26E+06 ?m3 and Res3 has a \npixel size of 0.064 ?m leading to a volume of  5.66E+04 ?m3. Just to \nemphasize the differences between the investigated 3D volumes, Res2 \nwould fit 10 times in to Res1, and it would take about 1600 distinct \nmeasurements with Res3 to cover the same volume as one shot with \nRes1. Therefore depending on the pore size more defined resolutions \n(such as Res3) might not present representative results of pore sizes \ndistribution. \n\n6.2.2.2. Autocorrelation function of 3D sub-samples \n\n Intending to verify how representative the three resolutions of \nanalyzed samples are from the original rock medium, we applied the \nautocorrelation function to the porosity. The autocorrelation function \nproperties are defined as statistical averages of a binary phase function \nZ(x) that is equal to unity if a point x in space is occupied by void and \nzero otherwise (ADLER et al., 1990): \n\n1,     when x belongs to the pore space\n( )\n\n0,    otherwise.\nZ x\n\n?\n= ?\n?\n\n (6.1) \n\nThe porosity ? and autocorrelation function C(?) can be easily measured \non 2D or 3D binary micrographs of segmented pore space as the first \ntwo moments of the binary phase function ( )Z x  (CUNHA, 2012): \n\n   ( )Z x? = ,  \n\n   ( ) ( ) ( )C u Z x Z x u= + . (6.2) \nThe autocorrelation function gives the probability of two points \nseparated by a distance u belong to the same image phase, in this case, \n?. The vector ? is called the displacement factor of image phase or \nsimply Lag. From Eq. (6.2) it is possible to assume that: \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             135 \n\n1. If 0u =\nr\n\n, \n\nTaken that from the definition of ( )Z x , Eq.(6.1), 2( ) ( )Z x Z x= . \nThis is also the maximal value that C (Eq. (6.2) can assume because \nwith the increasing of u , the product of the functions ( )Z x  and \n\n( )Z x u+  (which can only be 0 and 1) do not reach the value ?.  \n\n2. When u ? ? , \n\nIn this case there is no correlation between the points in the same \nimage phase; therefore the functions are statistically independent. \nThis is then the minimum value of autocorrelation function C(x).  \nFor a \u201cstatistically homogeneous\u201d porous medium, ? is a constant \nand C(u) is only a function of the lag vector u, i.e., they are \nindependent of the location vector x (LIANG et. al., 2000). \n\n \n Having the 3D sub-samples images (ROI = cubic 600 pixels) of \nRes1, Res2 and Res3 from samples A-11V and A-17V as shown in \nFigure 6.11, where the white phase represents pore, we extracted the \nautocorrelation functions using Imago 2.3.40 Software. The volumes of \nimage resolutions (Res1, Res2 and Res3) have a porosity of 3.22%, \n5.77% and 5.40% for sample A-11V and, 9.62%, 9.38% and 43.17% for \nsample A-17V. The results comparing the target autocorrelation \nfunctions are shown in Figure 6.12 where the minimum of the curves \nrepresent ?2. From this figure it is possible to see that for both samples \nRes1 and Res2 exhibit a long spatial correlation and revel close \nagreement suggesting that the low-order statistical properties (porosity \nand autocorrelation function) contain sufficient information to reproduce \nthe real rock porous media. The representative elementary volume \n(REV), defined as the smallest volume of a material that captures the \nglobal characteristics (in our case porosity), is even smaller than the \nanalyzed ROI for Res1 and Res2. On the other hand the spatial \ncorrelation of Res3, for both samples is very short. One can note that for \nA-17V Res3 the low level of correlation curve has a much higher value \n\n    \n2(0) ( ) ( )C Z x Z x ?= = =\n\nr\n (6.3) \n\n      2( ) ( ) ( ) .C u Z x Z x u ? ? ?= + = =  (6.4) \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n136              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\ndue to the high porosity comprised by this analyzed ROI. Considering \nthat some loss of geometric and topological information may be \nexpected to result at higher resolutions (such as Res3), even though the \nstatistical information remains intact (IONNIDIS and CHATZIS, 2000) \nwe judge that Res3 of sample A-17V does not represent the referred \nrock porous medium leading us to abandon this result. Although the \nimportance of having structural information of the smaller pores in such \naccurate scale as Res3 is crucial in the study of unconventional \nreservoirs, attributing reproducibility to this resolution might be \ndangerous since it does not contain sufficient statistical information.  \n \n\n (a) \n\n (b) \nFigure 6.12: Effect of the pore space resolution: average autocorrelation of \nthe 3D segmented images in all three resolutions obtained for samples A-\n\n11V (a) and A-17V (b).  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             137 \n\n6.2.2.3. Applying watershed algorithm \n\n The watershed algorithm from Avizo Fire Software, was \nperformed in the resolution Res2 for sample A-11V and Res1 for sample \nA-17 to characterize pore shape, tortuosity and orientations; only for \nsample A-17V (Res1) it was used to obtain pore size distribution \nseparating in particles the main connected pore network. The principle \nof watershed algorithm is to compute watershed lines on the gray-level \nimage for black objects or on the inverted image for white objects (pores \nin our investigation). It is a combination of the fast watershed, distance \nand numerical reconstruction algorithms. It detects surfaces that separate \nagglomerated particles and these surfaces are subtracted from the initial \nimage. When performing watershed algorithm analysis the meaningful \nparameter to be chosen is the \u201cdepth of valley\u201d or contrast factor.  \n \n\n \nFigure 6.13: Principles of watershed and distance maps algorithms \n\n(AVIZO\u00ae 7, 2012; RUSS, 2007). \n\nIn Figure 6.13(a) a short explanation about this principle is exposed and \nso smaller the contrast factor is chosen to be (lower levels of flooding) \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n138              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nmore separated the pore-network will be and smaller pores will be \nidentified. Simply put, the contrast factor is the parameter deciding how \ndistinct the separation of two or more pores has to be in order to be \ncounted individually. Thus, without the watershed command the 3D \nsegmented image is comprised by one or several connected networks \nconsidered as singular big pores only and a high amount of smaller \nunconnected pores (see the results of \u201cNoBin\u201d for A-17V in Figure 6.14 \nand Figure 6.15). By applying the command the connected network \nstructures will be broken into a certain amount of separated pore \nnetworks or simple pores, depending on the chosen contrast factor. \nSmaller the contrast factor (here also named \u201cBin\u201d) is more connected \npores will be considered individually and higher the amount of \nseparated pore structures will be. Figure 6.15 compares the results \nobtained for incremental and cumulative pore volumes (a) and \nfrequency (b) for sample A-17V (Res1) using contrast factors equal 1 \nand 10 and original (NoBin) pore structure.

Without \napplying the watershed algorithm, though the pore sizes have a Gaussian \ndistribution, the cumulative pore volume is almost entirely made up by a \nsingle connected network which is transformed into one big sphere with \nthe diameter of 422 ?m. After the application of the watershed algorithm \nwith the contrast factor 10 (Bin10) the pore volumes show a Gaussian \ndistribution fitting the corresponding frequencies, but the overall \nporosity is considerably reduced. With the contrast factor 1 the porosity \nis further reduced while the frequency of pore sizes is not anymore \ndistributed in a Gaussian shape. \n Besides being a simple and straightforward tool for pore \nseparation, the watershed algorithm in particular with non-convex \nshapes may miss or separate too much (AVIZO\u00ae 7). We observed that \nfor obtaining pore size distributions on the analyzed tight gas sandstones \n(comprised of constricted and heterogeneous pore\u2019s structure shapes), \none negative point was found: the amount of porosity decreases \nconsiderably from 9.92% in \u201cNoBin\u201d to 2.54% in \u201cBin1\u201d and 4.10% in \n\u201cBin10\u201d, thought the shape of incremental curve in Bin1 (bimodal) \nlooks acceptable. However for obtaining the pore size distributions in all \nresolutions for the analyzed samples we decided to use only the \nmathematical morphology (Imago) and the equivalent resistor network \n(C3DE program) algorithms. The results are discussed following. \n\n6.2.2.4. Mathematical morphology and equivalent resistor networks \n\n Both mathematical morphology (MM) and equivalent resistor \nnetwork (Skeleton) models were used to calculate pore size distributions \nfor two analyzed samples in all resolutions as shown in Figure 6.11. \nOnly Res3 for sample A-17V was not analyzed which besides not being \npossible to generate the skeleton due to the limitations of the computer \nin process extremely high porosity in the ROI, was considerate not \nrepresentative enough for the PSD analysis.  \n The approach for the mathematical morphology analysis by \nImago 2.3.40 Software consists in the basic idea of taking binary pore \nmorphology to probe an image with a simple, pre-defined shape, \ndrawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             141 \n\n3D image. This simple \"probe\" is called structuring element, and is itself \na subset of the chosen space or grid. The structuring element of \ntridimensional dominium used in Imago was the D345 for a 3D image \n(MOREIRA, 2013). The upper part of Figure 6.16 illustrates the \nobtained results for pore size distributions of individual scales of \nsamples A-11V and A-17V, using mathematical morphology (Imago). \n  The other approach used is based on the equivalent resistor \nnetwork (skeleton) model and was calculated using C3DE program \n(DONG and BLUNT, 2009; CUNHA, 2012). The principle is the \nimplementation of a fully parallel thinning algorithm for 3D that \nextracts the smaller axis converted in equivalent cylinders volume \n(throats) which are connected to bigger spaces then converted in \nequivalent inscribed spheres volumes (pore space). Thereby this model \nhas the advantage of calculating independently the pore and throat \nvolumes. Figure 6.17 exposes the results for the generated skeletons \nusing C3DE program in the 6003 volumes pixels, while the lower part of \nFigure 6.16 illustrates the results for pore size distributions of each \nindividual scales of samples A-11V and A-17V.  \n\n \nFigure 6.16: PSD of each scale obtained by mathematical morphology \n\n(Imago) and equivalent resistor network (C3DE) models.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n142              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 6.17: Generated skeletons for each acquired resulotion in samples \n\nA-11V and A-17V, using C3DE Software. \n\n Comparing the results between PSD curves from the \nmathematical morphology and generated skeleton (Figure 6.16) one can \nsee that (with the exception of Res3 in sample A-11V) for all acquired \nresolutions the shapes of the curves tend to be similar for both methods, \nthough MM identifies a bigger amount of pore volume in the smaller \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             143 \n\npore ranges. This fact is predictable remembering the principles related \nto each of the two used methods. Also the experimental results, as \nshown in Figure 6.4(a), for PSD measured by the N2GA+MICP \ncombination (see samples A-11V and A-17V) indicate a much lower \nrange of pore sizes, bellow to 1 ?m.  Nevertheless we decided to \ninvestigate the results given by both methods. One advantage of the \ngenerated skeleton method is that besides calculating the fraction of pore \nsizes it also gives the frequency in number (n) of each pore and throat \nsize genereted (see Figure 6.18 and Figure 6.19). As a result it allows \nthe operateor identify which pore and throat sizes are more \nrepresentative in each analyzed scale resolution. So we propose the \nintegration of 3D multi-scale PSD X-ray tomography by usage of the \nfrequency curves. Also, the PSD results given by the MM method \n(which considers only pore fraction volumes) were used to integrate the \nmulti-scale approach developed by MANTOVANI (2013), which in turn \nwas compared to the obtained results, as will be presented as follows. \n  \n\n6.2.3. PSD from multi-scale 3D X-ray tomography \n\n6.2.3.1. Combination of pore size frequencies  \n\n Figure 6.18 and Figure 6.19 show the results of PSD for A-11V \nand A-17V samples, obtained from the pore-network extraction using \nC3DE program. As one can see both pore\u2019s body and throat volumes are \ndisplayed with (a), (b) and (c) rows showing the incremental, the \ncumulative and the frequency volumes, all against pore radius. From \nthese graphics one can see (for each resolution) that the ranges of pore \nsizes for the higher peaks in the curves of incremental pore volumes and \npore frequencies do not necessary match. This is one indication that \nwhen analyzing PSD from image analysis the curve of pore size \nfrequencies besides showing information about pore fractions, gives an \nidea of which pore classes are more representative in the analyzed \nsample volume. Therefore we suggest that for evaluating PSD from \nacquired 3D images data of pore size frequencies and volume fractions \n(incremental volume) needs to be displayed and evaluated together. \n Having all the incremental pore volumes in the distinct \nresolutions, the question arises how to determine which scale (and range \nin this specific scale) should be included in the final combined 3D \nmulti-scale PSD having distinct incremental pore volumes from each \nresolution (scale). As a general approach, the frequency (n) of pore sizes \nwas taken into consideration to evaluate which pore class was best \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n144              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nrepresented in which resolution. Since the size of the analyzed volume \ndiffers from resolution to resolution, a comparison of the absolute \nfrequency (n) would not lead to the desired parameter. Therefore, the \nfrequency (n) was transformed for each resolution into a percentage of \nthe total amount of pores identified (see Appendix A, the column \nfrequency (%)). The highest percentage of frequency for each pore class \nidentifies the resolution that represents that pore class best and therefore \nits value of the incremental pore volume was taken into the calculation \nof the overall result. Naturally, the combination of frequencies are made \nup from the most accurate resolutions measured in the analyzed sample \n(in our work Res3 for A-11V and Res2 for A-17V) considering that this \nscale has the smallest pore sizes measured in more details. As an \nadditional safeguard, it was defined to control the results by cross-\ncomparing the incremental values directly against each other; e.g., in \nRes1 analyzing the throats of sample A-11V the pore class with the \nhighest percentage of frequency (2 ?m) an incremental porosity of \n(63.01%), while Res2 had an incremental porosity of 38.86%. In this \ncase the pore size class (2 ?m) was taken from Res2 since it was the \nhighest frequency percentage in that scale although lower then the \n63.01% in scale Res1. In such an occasion, if the 3D images do not \npresent something unusual, the general rule is overridden. All \ncalculation using the frequencial pore size combination obtained by the \nskeleton algorithm in C3DE software for samples A-11V and A-17V, \nthe sub-volumes were the ones showed in Figure 6.17. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             145 \n\n \n(a)                                      (b)                                       (c)  \n\nFigure 6.18: Sample A-11V: classes of incremental volume (a) cumulative \nvolume (b) and frequency (c) against pore radius obtained using the C3DE \n\nprogram for Res1, Res2 and Res3. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n146              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.19: Sample A-17V: classes of incremental volume (a) cumulative \nvolume (b) and frequency (c) against pore radius obtained using the C3DE \n\nprogram for Res1 and Res2. \n\n The results obtained for 3D multi-scale PSD using the \ncombination of frequencies are shown in Figure 6.20(b) for sample A-\n11V and Figure 6.21(b) for sample A-17V, where one can also see \nseparated the incremental and cumulative distributions for throat and \npore bodies. In Figure 6.20 and Figure 6.21 we also displayed the PSD \nresults: (a) when a simple addition of all resolutions would be applied \nwithout considering the overlapping of pore classes (note as a \nconsequence a higher value of porosity); (c) of multi-scale model \nproposed by (MANTOVANI, 2013) and validated in carbonate reservoir \nrocks, for both PSD\u2019s pore network obtained by mathematical \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             147 \n\nmorphology (Imago) and equivalent resistor (C3DE); (d) of \nN2GA+MICP combination and low-field NMR.  \n Comparing all results of incremental PSD curves obtained by  \nX-ray 3D multi-scale with N2GA+MICP combination and low-field \nNMR results, one can see that the spectrum of pores size distribution \nobtained by X-ray is shifted right toward bigger pores. When the pore \nnetwork extraction is performed using mathematical morphology model \nthat effect is a bit lessened but still present. On the other hand the results \nof porosity (shown by the cumulative pore volumes) were closer to the \nexperimental N2GA+MICP and low-field NMR values when the \ncombination of frequencies was performed, still overestimated even \nwith the lack of small pores range which were not acquired in the \nmeasured 3D X-ray resolutions. PSD from the X-ray CT images is \nsupposed to reflect the \u2018\u2018real\u2019\u2019 pore geometry as X-ray CT images \ninclude both connected and isolated pores. However, because of the \nresolution limitation, the PSD from this method must be limited too. \n One advantage on obtaining the curves of frequential number of \npores sizes accounts to help the operator on choosing the range of pores \nin each scale to be more representative in the combined multi-scale 3D \nX-ray PSD. Finally, the results of integrating PSD from multi-scale 3D \nX-ray tomography indicate the quality of the imaging method allowing \none to probe the spatial distribution of the macro and part of the micro \nporosity contributions across distinct scale resolution. As already stated \nin the literature review, the effective porosity in tight gas sandstones is \ntypically much lower than the total porosity because of diagenesis. The \ntype and magnitude of diagenesis governs the connectivity of the \nprimary porosity. Unlike conventional sandstone reservoirs that are \ncharacterized mostly by a primary intergranular porosity system, TGS \nmay exhibit several other types of porosity - including both primary and \nsecondary inter-granular porosity, detrital matrix porosity, micro-\nporosity, and grain fracture porosity (RUSHING et al., 2008). The \nidentification of such smaller pores is still a challenge in the 3D X-ray \ntomography technology. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n148              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n(a) \n\n(b)\n\n(c) \n\n(d) \nFigure 6.20: Comparison of PSD results for A-11V: (a) simple addition of \n\nall scales; (b) frequency combination; (c) Multi-scale model \n(MANTOVANI, 2013); (d) N2GA+MICP combination and low-field NMR. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             149 \n\n(a) \n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n (d) \nFigure 6.21: Comparison of PSD results for A-17V: (a) simple addition of \n\nall scales; (b) frequency combination; (c) Multi-scale model \n(MANTOVANI, 2013); (d) N2GA+MICP combination and low-field NMR. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n150              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n6.2.4. Quantifying pore\u2019s geometry properties \n\n Key issues concerning tight gas reservoirs are related to their \nheterogeneities, tortuosity and hydraulic connectivity. Knowledge of a \npore\u2019s reservoir geometry, axis orientations, and body connectedness is \nvital for meaningful reservoir modeling. The complex interconnection of \nmultilateral and heterogeneous sand bodies is a result of lateral \nmigration in conjunction with vertical stacking of fluid-based channels \ndisposed in the depositional environment of the reservoir. The oil and \ngas industry has long recognized the importance of pore structures (i.e., \npore and pore throat dimensions, geometry, size, distribution, etc.) on \nfluid flow and storage properties in all types of porous media. \nUnderstanding the pore structure and its properties is probably even \nmore critical in tight gas sandstones since diagenesis often modifies the \noriginal pore structure and reduces the average pore throat diameter, \ntypically causing an increase in both tortuosity and the number of \nisolated and/or disconnected pores (RUSHING et al., 2008). Figure 6.22 \nillustrates the shapes and sizes of some isolated pore and the connected \npore network observed in the TGS sample A-17V Res1. Following \nimportant pore characteristics related to the 3D pore medium of tight gas \nsandstones were measured and discussed. \n\n \nFigure 6.22: Distinct pore shapes and sizes found in rock A-17V Res1. \n\nAxes are given in ?m. \n\n6.2.4.1. Determination of pore connectivity \n\n Pore connectivity is another critical property of the pore structure \nwhich defines how well the pores are connected and therefore will affect \nthe local fluid flow (PENG et al., 2012). The connectivity is a measure \nof the number of independent paths between two points in the pore \nspace phase and, hence, of the degree of interconnectedness of the pores. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             151 \n\nThe permeability of sandstones is a direct function of the size and \nnumber of the interconnected pores (DULLIEN, 1992). In the last \ncentury innumerous researches (e. g., BARRETT and YUST, 1970; LIN \nand COHEN, 1982) performed metallographic serial sectioning of \nsamples on porous media and have formed the basis of a number of pore \nstructures studies. Most of the studies dealt with the problem of edge \neffects in the construction of the branch-node chart (treatment of the 2D \nstacking data). Nowadays with the use of X-ray CT techniques, the \nevaluation of the 3D connectivity of pore structures leads to more \naccurate results. The average values (Table 6.2) and distribution of pore \nconnectivity (Figure 6.23) were calculated using the equivalent resistor \nnetwork generated by C3DE program. As one can see for the higher \nresolutions on each sample the connectivity distribution is increased to \nthe lower values indicating that the analyzed volume is comprised by a \nconsiderable amount of either isolated or low connected pores, while A-\n11V Res2 and A-17V Res1 show a Gaussian type curve. On Table 6.2 \nbesides the average connectivity (coordination) number the volume-\nweighted average is also displayed. From this value we can determine \nthe relative importance of neighboring pores related to the pore volume. \nAs one can see, for both samples A-11V and A-17V, in Res1 and Res2 \nthe averages as volume-weighted get bigger, indicating that the bigger \npores are more connected. On the other hand for Res3 (sample A-11V) \nthe bigger pores are the ones more isolated.  \n \n\n \nFigure 6.23: Distribution of coordination number (connectivity) for \n\nsamples A-11V and A-17V. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n152              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nTable 6.2: Average and volume-weighted average coordination number of \nsamples A-11V and A-17V for the acquired resolutions.  \n\nResolution \n(?m)\n\nName Average\nVolume-weighted \n\naverage\nAverage\n\nVolume-weighted \naverage\n\n0.7 Res1 2.24 7.74 3.11 8.85\n0.3 Res2 3.69 6.06 2.63 9.41\n\n0.064 Res3 1.96 1.27\n\nA-17VA-11VSample\n\n \n\n6.2.4.2. Tortuosity and shape factor measurements \n\n  Tortuosity (?) is one of the most widely studied petrophysical \nparameters yet it is not very well understood (ZIARANI and \nAGUILERA, 2012). As already previously discussed in this work, the \ntortuosity and shape factor (Fo) of a porous medium are fundamental \nproperties that account for the sinusoidal flow path through its structure \nand can be empirical related to permeability estimation (CARMAN, \n1937). The tortuosity and shape factors were measured on samples A-\n11V and A-17V in terms of path length and geometrical definitions from \nthe 3D images measured by X-ray nano- and microCT. The calculations \nfor the tortuosity were already described in section 2.3.3, while the \nobtained shape factor is equal to (AWCOCK and AWCOCK, 1995): \n\n,\n4\n\nCroftonP\nA?\u00d7 \u00d7\n\n (6.6) \n\nwhere A is the area of segmented object and PCrofton is its Crofton \nperimeter as defined by DO CARMO (1976). The analyses were \nperformed using Avizo Fire Software on the 3D segmented pore \nstructure of Res1, Res2 and Res3 (Figure 6.9(b) and Figure 6.10(b)) and \nthe results are shown in Figure 6.24. For both tortuosity and shape factor \nproperties, the values found in the sample A-11V were bigger than in A-\n17V. From the N2GA, MICP, low-field NMR and 3D X-ray CT \nanalyses we can judge that sample A-11V is comprised by grain textures \nand sizes much finer than A-17V (this conclusion is also supported in \nthe subsequent chapter) which are mainly responsible for the \nheterogeneities in the pore network and decreasing of the analyzed \nparameters. Furthermore, studying mudrocks, YANG and APLIN \n(2007) fitted experimentally a value for Fo(?)\n\n2 equal to 1000, confirming \nthat smaller pores usually tend to be more tortuous. The measured \ntortuosity and shape factors were used in the Kozeny-Carman equation \nto estimate permeability in the analyzed TGS field A  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             153 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.24: Obtained results of tortuosity and shape factors measurements \n\nfrom distinct resolution of samples A-11V and A-17V. \n\n6.2.4.3. Surface area measurements \n\n Because of the complexities in the microstructure of natural rocks \nthe surface area obtained depends very strongly on the method used to \nmake the measurement. Surface areas estimated by the BET gas \nadsorption method frequently differ by several orders of magnitude from \nthose obtained by image analysis of the same rocks (KLEINBERG, \n1996). Measurements differ primarily due to the presence of clay, which \nhas a huge surface area that is included in BET gas adsorption \nmeasurements but missed by pore image analysis. A further problem is \nthat pore sizes in natural rocks range over several orders of magnitude. \nFigure 6.25 shows the specific surface area results obtained from 3D X-\nray CT analyses measured in the pore networks by Avizo (Figure 6.8 \nand Figure 6.9) and C3DE (Figure 6.17) programs.  \n The BET method generated the largest total surface area for both \nrocks (A-11V = 0.76 m2/g, A-17V = 1.00 m2/g). Specific surface area \nestimated with X-ray CT images was calculated as the measured total \nsurface area with (Avizo or C3DE) divided by the sample mass, which \nwas in turn calculated as the volume times the bulk density (A-11V = \n2.66 g/cm3 and A-17V = 2.65 g/cm3) measured by MICP experiments. \nThere may be certain scale effects on bulk density which will result in \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n154              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\ndifferent specific surface area. However, the values estimated from the \nhigh- and low-resolutions X-ray CT images are at least one order-\nmagnitude smaller than the BET measured. This indicates the \nsignificance of small pores in the pore surface area for analyzed TGS.  \n \n\n \nFigure 6.25: Specific surface area results from X-ray CT using Avizo and \n\nC3DE programs. \n\n6.2.4.4. Aspect ratio distribution, phi and theta orientations \n\n The pore aspect ratio spectrum may be simplified into round \npores and cracks. The latter refers to the pores with aspect ratio equal to \nor less than 0.1 while 1 would be a perfect sphere. The amount of cracks \nand round pores are related to lithologic factors; clay contents effect on \nthe elastic moduli of rocks may be ascribed to its role in changing the \npore aspect ratio spectrum (ZHANG and BENTLEY, 2003). XU and \nWHITE (1995) set the pore aspect ratio to be 0.15 for sand-related pores \nand 0.04 for clay-related pores, attributing velocity reduction in clay-\nbearing rocks chiefly to flatter pores in clay. The results of the \ndistribution of the pore aspect ratio spectra, one important pore structure \nproperty, was already employed to interpret the elastic properties in \nsandstones, e.g. (ZHANG and BENTLEY, 2003). Figure 6.26 shows \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             155 \n\nobtained results for the pore aspect ratios distributions obtained in the \nconnected pore network (NoBin) and after pore separation (Bin1 more \nseparations than Bin10) in samples A-11V and A-17V. As one can see \nthe results indicate that rock A-11V is comprised by more compacted \n(narrow) pores than A-17V is.  \n \n\n \nFigure 6.26: Results of aspect ratio for samples A-11V and A-17V. \n\n To evaluate Phi and Theta Orientation of pores, the \ninterconnected pore structure needs to be separated. Having all particles \n(pores) separated as individual \u201cbins\u201d (where Bin1 contains smaller \npores sizes then Bin10), the characteristic orientation of each pore can \nbe measured. This evaluation of preferential pore orientation can give an \nindicative into which direction in the analyzed field the hydrocarbons \nprospection should be easier, therefore optimal. As the name already \ndefines, investigated samples A-11V and A-17V were plugs extracted \nvertically to the bedding field direction, so all experimental permeability \nPDP measurements were performed in the Z-axis direction.

As one can see, any considerable effect on \nthe orientation was observed within pore size decreasing (Bin10 to \nBin1). On the other hand, the results indicate that in both samples the \npores tend to be organized more to the X- or Y-axis directions, tough in \nsample A-11V this characteristic is even more representative (observe \nthe counts of frequency in Figure 6.27). If these results would be \ntransposed to the macro-scale of the reservoir one could affirm that the \nhorizontal hydrocarbons prospection would be favorable in the \nhorizontal bedding direction. \n \n\n \nFigure 6.27: Phi and Theta pores orientation of samples A-11V and A-17V \n\nafter pore separation using Bin1 and Bin10. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             157 \n\n \nFigure 6.28: Spatial position of particles having the same \u201corientation phi\u201d \n\n(90\u00ba) and \u201corientation theta\u201d equal 0o and 110o. \n\n6.3. Mineralogical characterization, textural and structural \naspects for TGS field A \n\n As structural phases and compositional analysis can be used for \ninterpretation of the N2GA, MICP, LFNMR, nano- and microCT \nmeasurements, both XRD and scanning electron microscopy analysis \nwere performed on samples of field A. These analyses were also used to \nhelp define mineralogical controls on permeability variations within \ndepth in field A. The TGS samples were collected in location within \n4944 to 5040 meters depth along field A. Considering the SEM, FESEM \nand XRD analyses performed in these samples we observed that the \nBrazilian field studied is well defined by a significant change in \nlithologies. As stated before, the samples shown considerable change in \nporosity and permeability, the most obvious change is the presence of \ncalcite in the sample located in the upper part of the field. For all \nsamples we observed that framework grains are mainly plagioclase \nfeldspar with sub-dominat components of quartz, alkali feldspar and \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n158              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nclay minerals.

From the \ndifferences between the analyzed samples in Figure 6.29, the intensities \nof XRD patterns show that A-11V and A-12V (from the upper regions) \nhave nucleated phases of calcite and clinochlore which get much smaller \nin the samples A-17V and A-19V. On the other hand for A-12V and A-\n17V it is possible to see nucleated phase of sanidine and A-17V and A-\n19V nucleated phases of biotite (black mica), siderophyllite (rare type of \nmica) and muscovite (white mica) besides an increase of intensity in the \npeak of quartz. One can see that the analyzed samples exhibit a \nsuccession of particular mineral phases of stable elements, being more \nsimilar as closer located to each other through the depths in the analyzed \nwell. For sample A-11V the high intensity of calcite peak in the mainly \ndifference observed between the samples. From the XRD patterns one \ncan assume that the calcite phase from the samples in deeper regions \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n160              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\npractically disappears because it was already either dissolved or \nprecipitated by groundwater (telodiagenesis). When conditions are right \nfor precipitation, calcite forms mineral coatings that cement the existing \nrock grains together or it can fill fractures. When conditions are right for \ndissolution, the removal of calcite can dramatically increase the porosity \nand permeability of the rock. A better understanding will be discussed \nfurther in the work by the SEM and FESEM analysis.  \n \n\n \nFigure 6.30: Quantitative analysis from the XRD patterns of TGS field A. \n\nLegend is displayed in increasing amount order. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             161 \n\n6.3.2. SEM and FESEM analyses \n\n Stable backscattered electron (BSE) signals from scanning \nelectron microscope (SEM) were used to generate X-ray mapping \nimages of the studied TGS samples from field A. The average BSE gray \nvalue of every region is directly related to a mineral of unique average \natomic number. Therefore from this analysis most important minerals \npresent in the analyzed samples and its organization could be \ndifferentiated. Although the BSE mode was used in all five samples \nfrom field A to create chemical maps, only samples A-11V and A-17V \nlocated in the top and bottom of field, are shown here. Figure 6.31 \nshows the obtained results with right column exhibiting each mineral \ngrain delineated from BSE image and left column displaying the \nelements discriminated using simple X-ray mapping.  \n\n \nFigure 6.31: Backscattered electron signal and X-ray mapping from the \n\nFESEM analyses in TGS from field A (A-11V top, A-17V bottom). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n162              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nAs one can see for the analyzed samples BSE images provide details of \nmineral intergrowth and very fine pore-structures. Each scanned BSE \nimage area (~ 800 ?m2) returned relative abundance maps of Si, Al, Na, \nK, Ca, O, Fe and Mg for both samples. The textural relationships \nbetween various grains and pores, amount of Ca, Fe, Mg and Mn and \norganization of minerals, though, is considerable distinct between A-\n11V and A-17V samples with two of the most striking and distinct \nfeatures observed being:  \n\n- Sample A-11 - presence of phases constituted by Ca and Mg \nelements, mainly calcite and wollastonite identified by XDR \nmeasurements,  suggesting that the pores once present in this \nsample are now filled by calcite overgrowth; \n\n- Sample A-17V - even being comprised by considerable \namount of pores (and less compressed then in A-11V) this \nsample shows Fe and Mg rich clay minerals (illite, chlorite, \nand illite/chlorite mixed layers) lining/filling/bridging pore. \n\n According to Soeder and Chowdiah (1990), tight gas sandstones \nare divided into three types based on their pore geometry. This \nclassification emphasizes the effects of the original deposition \nenvironment and the invasive influence of diagenesis in the \ndevelopment of the reservoir. Type I sandstones have open intergranular \npores whose pore throats are blocked by authigenic5 clay minerals; Type \nII have intergranular pores that have largely been occluded by \nauthigenic cements (mainly quartz and calcite) and reduced to narrow \nslots that connect large secondary pores formed by grain dissolution. \nType III sandstones have their intergranular volume filled by dentrital \nclay matrix and have mainly microporosity. It is known in the literature \nthat Type II reservoirs are by far the most common in commercial tight \ngas fields (LERCHE and NOETH, 2004). For rocks of field A we can \nassume that sample A-11V tends to follow the classification as Type II, \nSamples A-12H and A-12V Type III, while samples A-17V and A-19V \nshowed more microstruture similarities to be of Type I.  \n\n                                                        \n5 Authigenic clay minerals form mainly during diagenesis, catagenesis, and \nmetagenesis (SARKISYAN, 1970). Authigenic clays can occur as pore-\nfillings, pore-bridges or pore-linings and as complex combinations of these \nthree forms. The various clay morphologies produce pore-systems with \nlarge surface areas and numerous micropores, and the overall effect is to \nreduce reservoir quality (BROWN, 1985). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             163 \n\n According to Rushing et al. (2008) important forms of diagenesis \n(in order of frequency of occurrence and severity) are: mechanical \ncompaction, cementation from quartz overgrowths, calcite cementation, \ngrain-coating/pore lining clay development, grain dissolution, and \nankerite cementation. Only the last form was not observed in the TGS of \nfield A. The enhanced level of compaction is most easily identified by \nthe ductile grain deformation and elongate grain contacts. Grain \ndeformation is recognized by argillaceous rock fragments that are \nsqueezed into the adjacent primary pore space and effectively \neliminating those pores. The occurrence of this phenomenon appears to \nbe stronger for sample A-17V then in A-11V. This fact would be \nexpected since massive calcite cementation (as one can see occurring in \nsample A-11V, Figure 6.33 and Figure 6.34) ceases the effect of \nmechanical compaction (UMAR et al., 2011). Calcite cementation with \nsignificant pore volume losses appear to be restricted more to the upper \nregions in field A. In these regions it appears that quartz cementation, in \nthe form of overgrowths, is extensive in the sandstones with limited \nintergranular clay (A-11V and A-12V). The overgrowth crystals \ndeveloping on adjacent grains tend to coalesce and eventually link, \nthereby occluding the intergranular pores destroying the primary pore \nsystem (RUSHING et al., 2008).  \n Figure 6.32 and Figure 6.33 illustrate the field emission scanning \nelectron photomicrographs for rocks A-11V, A-12V, A-17V and A-19V, \nfractured and polished samples, respectively. In these figures it can be \nseen that for samples A-17V and A-19V considerable amounts of \ndiagenetic chlorite, chayesite and illite are present filling quartz-\ncemented walls, occurring primarily as thin coatings on portions of the \ngrain surfaces. We could judge that a portion of the matrix clay has been \nrecrystallized changing its morphology for these two higher porosity \nrocks, while for samples A-11V and A-12V (lower porosity samples) \nthe matrix clay appears to have less recrystallization. For the rocks A-\n11V and A-12V it is also observed that the intergranular pore structure \nis more occluded (lacking even small open apertures) and secondary \npore space is calcite filled (A-11V) or not representative visible (A-\n12V). Figure 6.34 elucidates in 3D the interaction of pore and calcite \nphases plus its quantification for two chosen distinct ROIs in sample A-\n11V. In both ROIs the amount of calcite is much higher than porosity. \nFor ROI x=y=z = 450 pixels, a big amount of porosity was intentionally \ntaken to better visualize the pore-calcite interaction in sample A-11V. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n164              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n Overall, one can see that the analyzed samples displayed \nimportant information about structural, mineralogical and textural \norganization in field A which appear to be highly heterogenic within \ndepth. Additionally the mainly observed features (calcite cementation \nand diagenetic chlorite and illite) contribute to the decreasing of \npermeability and porosity values in varied regions in the studied \nreservoir. Calcite cement frequently seals (degrades) porosity and it is \nusually found in sediments near the surface where meteoric water may \ndisplace original marine pore water, resulting in distinct types of \ncements. Most calcite present in upper part of the field A has been \ndisappeared through the increasing of depth. It was observed that the \ndecrease of calcite content reflected in this field higher porosity and \npermeability values as obtained from the petrophysical analysis. \n \n\n \nFigure 6.32: Photomicrographs from SE signal obtained from FESEM \n\nanalysis in fractured samples of the TGS from field A. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             165 \n\n \nFigure 6.33: Photomicrographs from BSE signal obtained from FESEM \n\nanalysis in polished samples of the TGS from field A. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n166              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 6.34: Percentage and interaction pore-calcite in sample A-11V. \n\n6.4. Empirical permeability results \n To describe the transport mechanism in ultra-tight porous media \nmore accurately, a combination of the processes Knudsen diffusion, slip \nflow and adsorption/desorption is required (DARABI et al., 2012). In \naddition, the effect of pore-surface roughness is one example of local \nheterogeneity on the pore surface and it can account in the permeability \nresults (COPPENS 1999; COPPENS and DAMMERS, 2006). \nIncreasing surface roughness leads to an increase in residence time of \nmolecules in porous media and a decrease in Knudsen diffusivity. Pore \ndimension fractal (Df) is a quantitative measure of surface roughness \nthat varies between 2 and 3, representing a smooth surface and a space-\nfilling surface, respectively (COPPENS and DAMMERS, 2006). \nConsidering the characteristic radius found in TGS samples of field A \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             167 \n\nand the N2 molecular mean free path (2.15 nm), the Knudsen number \nwas found to be 0.0215 &lt;Kn &lt;0.1075, a range located in the slip flow \nregime, therefore, Klinkenberg\u2019 corrections were applied in the \nmeasured PDP permeability. Also, the pore-surface roughness and local \nheterogeneities were observed in the analyzed TGS rocks allowing a \nbetter understanding on the permeability results.  \n A number of permeability prediction tools were used in this \nchapter to estimate absolute permeability in the five samples of well A. \nEach applied correlation was already discussed in section 2.5, whilst a \nbrief explanation upon permeability simulations in 3D nano- and \nmicroCT reconstructions is exposed in 3.6.5. To evaluate the predicted \nand simulated permeabilities, PDP results were set as a basis.  Figure \n6.35 shows the permeability-porosity relation of investigated TGS, with \npermeability and porosity measured by PDP technique (after \nKlinkenberg\u2019 correction) and N2GA+MICP combination.  \n\n \nFigure 6.35: Log plot of permeability versus porosity of samples from well \n\nA. Correlation is given by R2 = 0.9339 \n\nIn the graphic above, a direct tendency of more porous samples having \nhigher permeability values is shown. Exclusively sample A-12H does \nnot really follow this trend; despite being the less porous sample it \ndisplayed a higher permeability value than A-12V, originating exactly \nfrom the same field region but plugged in a distinct well bedding \ndirection. This behavior can be understood by the horizontal direction to \nthe well bedding taken for the plug sample A-12H used in the PDP \nexperiments. This horizontal direction corresponds to our 3D coordinate \nsystem where X- and Y-axis are oriented. As already discussed in \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n168              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n6.2.4.4 and displayed in Figure 6.27, the pore bodies present on samples \nof field A (A-11V and A-17V) have a preferential orientation to the X- \nand Y-axis. As a consequence, one can expect a favored fluid flow in \nthe horizontal bedding direction and so the increase of permeability \nvalues. \n If a sandstone has only moderate amount of cementing material, \npermeability can be correlated directly with grain size. On the other \nhand, if a formation has about the same grain size but varying amount of \ncements (our case), then a direct relation between porosity and \npermeability has been claimed. In general, however, just a simple \nmeasure of either grain size or porosity will not prove to be a reliable \nguide to the permeability of sandstones (DULLIEN, 1992). For tight gas \nsandstones the rule is not different, as we observed for the samples \noriginating from the same well studied in the present work, the \nexperimental PDP values of permeability varied from 0.0004 to 0.034 \nmD. Porosities of studied tight gas sandstones are almost entirely a \nfunction of the kind of cementing material between the sand grains, clay \nbordering pore walls and the extent to larger grains. From the standpoint \nof geological processes, two main reasons account for loss of porosity \nand consequently permeability. The first is cementation by calcite, silica \nand other minerals introduced into the rock by circulating ground water. \nThe second is compaction that squeezes fine-grained matrix material \ninto inter-connected larger grains by grain-boundary solutions (ink-\nbottle pore type) at points of higher stress. As reported by Dullien \n(1992), the porosity of sandstones tends to diminish systematically with \ndepth and the amount of fluids in storage, though it was the complete \nopposite for the five analyzed samples of field A. Within a depth of \nabout 100 meters (see Table 4.1) indeed significant differences were \nobserved in the microstructure of the sample resulting in differences of \npermeability of at least three decimal orders.  \n In this part of the thesis we investigate the prediction of intrinsic \npermeability using models stated in the literature for low-permeability \n(or conventional reservoir) rocks and making use of the pore structure \nparameters measured for the TGS rocks. Also the simulated \npermeability from 3D reconstructed medium was performed using \nLattice-Boltzmann method and the Darcy\u2019 law flow through the \ngenerated equivalent resistor obtained by the C3DE program. The \nsimulated permeability was executed only in the Z-axis direction of the \nmanufactured nano- and microCT mini-plugs as being the vertical \ndirection to the well bedding of plugs used in the PDP experiments (A-\n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             169 \n\n11V and A-17V).

Permeability from the empirical correlations \n\n The figure above depicts comparisons between the permeability \nresults obtained in the experimental PDP tests and the models from \ncapillary pressure curves, fine-grained rocks and low-field NMR curves \nfor the samples A-11V, A-12H, A-12V, A-17V and A-19V. If the \nagreement is perfect the data points will fall exactly on the diagonal line \nplotted in the graph. As can be seen, the values obtained with the models \nbased in the capillary pressure curves and from NMR measurements in \nclosed symbols tend to be higher then the measured PDP permeability. \nThese results were calculated using mainly the parameters values \nsuggested in the literature for sandstones. Calculations performed using \ncalibration through measured PDP permeability are presented by the \nopen symbols. \n\n6.4.1.1. Results based on the capillary pressure curves \n\n For the three permeability correlations already discussed in \nsection 2.5.1, Winland-Pittman, Aguilera and Katz-Thompson models, \nthe data resulting from the PSD curves obtained by the N2GA+MICP \ncombination was applied. Table 6.5 displays this data while the \nformation factor (F) was already displayed in Table 6.4 and is a result \nfrom the 3D X-ray CT measurements of tortuosity and total porosity \nobtained by the N2GA+MICP combination. Only for samples A-11V \nand A-17V tortusoity was measured. For samples A-12H and A-12V \nthese values were considered to be the same as for A-11V and for A-\n19V the same for A-17V. \n \n\nTable 6.5: Pore structure parameters used for the models based in Pc. \n\nSamples\nPorosity \n\n(%)\nr35 (?m) r70 (?m)\n\nlc inflection \n(?m)\n\nA-11V 6.28 0.2549 0.0551 0.1135\nA-12H 5.45 0.0793 0.032 0.048\nA-12V 6.12 0.0724 0.0248 0.046\nA-17V 11.96 0.3655 0.0867 0.21\nA-19V 10.91 0.5261 0.1242 0.305\n\nFrom the Pc curves of N2GA+MICP combination\n\n \n \n\nAs one can see in  \nFigure 6.36 (a), the values of estimated permeability assuming a \ncorresponding pore throat radius with 35% fluid saturation, r35, \n(Winland-Pittman and Aguilera models) were higher than the measured \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             171 \n\nresults obtained using the PDP technique. A better agreement for the \nWinland-Pittman and Aguilera models in the analyzed TGS of field A \nwas found when the pore radius corresponding to the 70% fluid \nsaturation, r70, is applied. For the Katz-Thompson equation, the smallest \nthroat at the percolation threshold, lc, equal the inflection point from the \nPSD saturation curve also gived reasonable results when compared with \nthe PDP results. This agreement was better especially for samples A-\n11V and A-17V which had the tortuosity value to calculate formation \nfactor, as exposed in Eq. (2.26), measured from the 3D X-ray CT. \n\n6.4.1.2. Kozeny-Carman, Pape et al (1999) and Series-Parallel models \n\n Figure 6.36(b) depicts the results for the permeability models in \nfine-grained rocks as described in section 2.5.2. The dataset for the \ncalculations were defined based on the values of porosity, PSD and \nspecific surface area, So, calculated by the N2GA+MICP combination \n(So only by N2GA technique, BET theory), shown in Table 5.2, and the \nvalues of tortuosity and shape factor calculated by 3D X-ray CT, \nexposed in Table 6.4. As can be seen from the comparison between the \nexperimental and estimated permeability values, the Kozeny-Carman \nequation shows the best results whereas the values predicted by Pape et \nal. and Series-Parallel models tend to be slightly lower than the \nmeasured results obtained using the PDP-200. Nonetheless, the results \nof the fully empirical models analyzed in this section were all within the \nsame magnitude as the PDP experimental results. We consider that these \nresults for the TGS rocks of field A provide reasonable evidence of the \nvalidity of the K-C, Pape et al. (1999) and S-P approaches in these \nrocks. The best estimation reached by the K-C model could be attributed \nto the fact that this model considers effects besides the porosity, like the \ntortuosity, shape factor and So, which were properly measured for the \nanalyzed rocks in this work. By the FESEM and PSD curves we could \nsubdivide the TGS rocks of field A in two main regions having similar \nmicrostructure/petrophysical properties: the upper region (samples A-\n11V, A-12H and A-12V) and the lower region (A-17V and A-19V). \nTherefore, in the K-C model we used the so called K-C constant ( 2?oF ) \ncalculated by the X-ray CT analysis for samples A-11V and A-17V, \nequal to 121 and 17.8 for samples located in the upper and lower regions \nof field A, respectively. The same procedure of establishing two distinct \nregions from the analyzed samples of field A was also applied to \ncalculate the pore geometry parameters related to the NMR models, \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n172              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nbalancing the ability to meaningfully estimate the properties involved in \nthe distinct rocks regions found in this field. \n\n6.4.1.3. Coates 1999 and Mean-T2 models from low-field NMR results \n\n The theoretical basis about the Coates 1999 and the Mean-T2 \nmodels for permeability estimation using NMR measurements was \ngiven in sub-chapter 2.5.3. Figure 6.36 (c) shows the comparison \nbetween the estimated and measured permeability results. The \ncalculations concerning the T2cutoff and T2gm values were already \nperformed and discussed in 6.1.3; Table 6.6 shows the porosity and the \ncalibrated pore geometric constants, C and b, from low-field NMR \nmeasurements. Both models used in this chapter can only be as accurate \nand precise as the constant is chosen. In the case of the Coates model the \nliterature suggests a value of 10 for the constant C. With this value and \nusing T2cutoff  = 33 ms (from the literature in sandstones) or our measured \nvalues (right column in Table 6.1) the prediction for permeability leads \nto higher values than the ones measured by PDP-200, see orange and \ngreen full circles in Figure 6.36 (c). If the experimental PDP values are \nin turn used to first calculate a more refined value for C for the two field \nregions in the analyzed TGS rocks, which would be C = 21.57 for the \nupper regions and C = 37.93 for the lower regions, we can obtain much \nmore accurate predictions (see open circles in Figure 6.36 (c)). The \nrefined constant is based on the average of the individual values of C \nwhen inserting the experimental permeability values into the Coates \nequation. Note though, that in order to performe it you first need to \ncharacterize well the rock you want to analyze and you need up front a \nrefined value for C from previous studies for that same type of rock, as \nthe analyses performed here by PDP technique. The same proceeding \nwas applied to the Mean-T2 model. With the literature suggestion for b \nequal 4 we receive mixed results for the permeability prediction but all \nin a reasonable range to the measured permeability. The calculation of a \nrefined constant based on the experimental PDP results lead us to the \nvalue of b = 20.26 for rocks located in the upper regions and b = 0.79 \nfor rocks from the lower regions. As can be seen in Table 6.6 the \nindividual values of constant b differed considerably between the \nsamples analyzed while the individual C values were not far from the \naverage of 28. This is explained since b is a parameter depending from \nthe porosity and the permeability formation while C is a parameter of \npore geometry.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             173 \n\n \nFigure 6.36: Results of permeability prediction from empirical correlations. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n174              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nTable 6.6: Pore structure parameters permeability estimation from NMR. \n\nSample\nPorosity \n\n(%)\nFFI BVI\n\nA-11V 6.83 48829.49 134714.49 29.10 1.63 6.89 0.0004\nA-12H 5.69 24973.36 129104.26 15.63 1.26 39.48 0.0007\nA-12V 6.20 29753.40 133387.76 19.98 1.47 14.42 0.0005\nA-17V 10.93 109074.62 74256.05 41.89 9.88 0.72 0.0101\nA-19V 10.05 152237.38 70208.83 33.97 20.31 0.86 0.0360\n\n21.57 20.26\n37.93 0.79\n\nAverage\nUpper region field A\nLower region field A\n\nfrom T2cutoff in our TGS\n\nLow-field NMR \nmeasurements\n\nCoates et al.

Results for simulation of single-phase flow \n\n A microstructure defined by a digital image is already discretized \nand lends itself immediately to numerical computation of many \nproperties (KNACKSTEDT et al., 2006). In this subsection we show the \nresults obtained of the single-phase permeability on samples, A-11V and \nA-17V, based on the numerical Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) \n(MARTYS and CHEN, 1996; DOS SANTOS et al., 2005; BAKER et \nal., 2012) and applying Darcy\u2019s law in the pore equivalent resistor \nnetwork (skeleton) extracted using the C3DE program (CUNHA, 2012) \nas shown in Figure 6.17. Simulations using the LBM were performed in \na subset of 6003 pixels for sample A-11V Res2 (Figure 6.37(a)) and in \ntwo subsets from distinct regions of sample A-17V Res1 with 10003 \npixels each (Figure 6.37(b)). The results of simulated permeability are \nshown in Table 6.7.  \n From the results with gas nitrogen passing through a network of \npore equivalent resistor (C3DE), one can see that permeability \nsimulation varies from distinct sample axis, being bigger especially in \nthe X-axis direction. These results are in perfect agreement to the pore \npreferential orientation found and discussed in Figure 6.27. Another \ninteresting result is observed by the comparison of Res1 and Res2 in \nrock A-17V. One can see that Res1 shows a much defined axis direction \n(X) where the permeability is bigger, while in Res2 the values tend to be \nclose. These results suggest that simulated permeability is being highly \ninfluenced by the volume of sample analyzed (i.e. Res1 was about 10 \ntimes bigger than Res2, so more representative although with low \nresolution).  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             175 \n\n However in the investigated TGS, from both pore equivalent \nresistor (C3DE) and LB methods, simulation of permeability on the \nresolvable connected porosity did not provide reliable results compared \nto the experimental PDP values. Recently, working with LB method, \nBAI et al. (2010) demonstrated by systematically varying sample size \nand resolution, that calculated permeabilities for samples with porosity \nlower than 30% decreased by about two orders of magnitude with a five \ntimes increased sample size at full tomographic resolution (4.76 ?m per \nvoxel/lattice node). Low-porosity samples were especially sensitive to \nsimulation resolution, with the permeability increasing by at least one \norder of magnitude for every halving of the grid resolution. Furthermore \nan important factor to be considered when comparing experimental PDP \nresults and simulated permeability is the pressure condition applied on \nthe sample to be analyzed. When the sample is scanned and X-ray CT \ndata are collected, there is only the effect of atmospheric pressure acting \nwhile in a PDP experiments a net stress pressure is applied. To see the \ninfluence on the permeability results with the confining pressure in the \nstudied TGS, compare Figure 5.1.  \n Giving the importance of microporosity to the overall properties \nin the analyzed tight gas sandstones (compare N2GA+MICP curves, \nFigure 5.9, also FESEM micrographics, Figure 6.32) there is a need to \nundertake a study considering the permeability in the 3D medium \nincorporating both the resolvable porosity (Figure 6.37) and the \nmicroporosity out of investigated resolution, as suggested already by \nKnacksted et al. (2006), studying carbonates. However for \nunconventional reservoir rocks such as TGS this task is still unsolved in \n3D pore network simulations once that even for the resolution of  \nutilized nanoCT (0.064 ?m) the complete range of smaller pore found in \nsuch rocks (down to 0.01 ?m) is not reached. Besides, the presence of \nclay minerals (i.e. chlorite/ biotite/ chamosite/ illite), K-mineral \nalterations and grains/pore compaction observed by the SEM/FESEM \nanalyses, play a significant role of micro-barriers inhibiting the fluid \ncirculation. These textures could not be completely observed in our 3D \nimages. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n176              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n(a)\n\n(b) \nFigure 6.37: 3D connected network pores: (a) 6003 pixel size 0.35?m \n\nvolume of sample A-11V  Res2 and (b) two sub-volumes (10003, pixel size \n0.75?m) of Sample A-17V Res1. \n\nTable 6.7: Results for simulated permeability. \n\nN2GA+MICP PDP\n\nX Y Z SV1 SV2 SV1 SV2\nRes1 3.22 0 0 0\nRes2 5.77 146.83 127.05 84.86 5.77 5.52\nRes3 5.4 0 0 0\nRes1 9.62 137.66 18.83 12.16 5.16 9.39 9.76 30.26\nRes2 9.38 81.92 71.4 44.99\nRes3\n\nPore equivalent resistor (C3DE)\n\nA\n-1\n\n1V\n\n11.96\n\nA\n-1\n\n7V\n\nPermeability (axis direction), \nmDPorosity, \n\n%\n\nPermeability   \n(Z-axis), mD\n\n0.0004\n\n0.01\n\nSample\n\nSimulation from 3D CT images Experimenatl\n\nPorosity, \n%\n\nPermeabilit\ny, mD\n\n6.28\n\nPorosity, %\n\nLattice-Boltzmann\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             177 \n\n7. USAGE OF PHOTOACOUSTIC TECHNIQUE TO \nCHARACTERIZE THERMAL DIFFUSIVITY AND \nPOROSITY IN SEAL ROCKS \n\n Measurement of thermal diffusivity of rocks is important to \nunderstand the thermal properties and the characteristics of heat flow \ninto the formation of oil or gas. The sealing capacity is controlled either \nby the rock microstructure or by chemical interactions between minerals \nand the permeating fluid (DESBOIS and URAI, 2009). In this chapter \nwe describe the results obtained from the PAS method applied in three \nseal rocks originated from distinct oil and gas wells in Brazil. Each of \nthe rock samples were prepared for the PAS analysis as a disc sample \nsliced in the vertical direction of well bedding and as a manufactured \ndisc sample after rock grinding and compaction. Both samples (disc and \npowder compressed) were taken from cleanned core rock samples. The \ninetention of preparing a powder compressed sample is to verify the \nvalues of termal diffusivity only of the matrix rock without the influene \nof porosity. Our main task was to verify how thermal properties of seal \nrocks are related to the porosity since it is known that cap rocks can act \nas excellent insulators over oil and gas reservoirs, aiding the formation \nand thermal maturation of petroleum (FENG et al., 2013). We also \npropose a model to correlate measured thermal diffusivity (TD) to \nporosity values. The results show that thermal diffusivity decline as \napparent porosity of the samples decreases. \n\n7.1. PAS results for signal phase and amplitude \n As previously discussed, the characteristic frequency \n\n( )2cf l? ?= characterizes the transition from the thermally thin \nregime ( )cf f&lt;to the thermally thick regime ( )cf f> . In this work, \nfor the analyzed seal rocks, which are a type of shale having \nheterogeneous pore structure and mixtures of muscovite, illite, quartz \nand clays in its matrix, we considered an average value of thermal \ndiffusivity of 0.019 cm2/s (GUIMAR\u00c3ES et al., 2013) and by \nconsidering that the largest thickness of the samples was 510 ?m, the \nsmallest characteristic frequency of 2, 33cf ?

The phase behavior \nof powder compresses samples SR-42 and SR-47 is similar. The \nprocedure described in the section 3.8 for obtaining the thermal \ndiffusivity of each process to the PAS signal amplitude was used as \ndiscussed following. \n\n7.2. PAS mechanisms and thermal diffusivity results \n Figure 7.2 shows PAS signal and PAS signal phase versus the \nsquare root modulation frequency of the intraband nonradiative \nthermalization (thermal diffusion) mechanism contribution observed for \nthe analyzed seal rocks. As one can see only SR-42 and SR-57 presented \nthis main contribution to the PAS signal and phase. For the SR-42 \nvertical sample, the slope of the dash lines fitted between 10 and 17 Hz \nwere a = 0.30308 (from the signal amplitude data) and a = 0.30472 \n(from phase data), whereas for the SR-42 powder compressed sample, \nthe slope of the straight lines fitted between 8 and 15 Hz were a = \n0.32457 (from the signal amplitude data) and a = 0.31684 (from phase \ndata).  For the SR-57 powder compressed sample, the slope of the \nstraight lines fitted between 1 and 6 Hz were a = 0.65639 (from the \nsignal amplitude data) and a = 0.64758 (from phase data). Using the \nexpression s sa l ? ?=  and considering the average value of a from \nsignal and phase data, the calculated thermal diffusivity values were \n?s=0.08848 cm\n\n2/s and ?s=0.07636 cm\n2/s for SR-42 vertical and powder \n\ncompressed, respectively, and ?s=0.01667 cm\n2/s for SR-57 powder \n\ncompressed. Due to the phase inversion observed in Figure 7.1 \nequations (3.29) and (3.30) were applied to obtain the thermal \ndiffusivity of the SR-57 vertical sample from the thermal diffusion \nmechanism contribution. The signal phase shows a discontinuity at 10 \nHz, which is a fingerprint of the contribution of thermal diffusion to the \nPAS signal and refers to the signal phase inversion of 180o. The integer \nnumber n is related to the discontinuity points due to the tan(x) \ndependence of the phase. Use of the value 10 Hz in expression (3.30) \nand n=0 (first discontinuity) leads to the value of fc=4.053 Hz and \n?s=0.01937 cm\n\n2/s.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n180              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n \nFigure 7.2: (Gray online) on PAS signal (pink symbol) and PAS signal \n\nphase (red symbol) versus modulation frequency for samples SR-42 (a) and \nSR-57 (b) showing the thermal diffusion mechanism. \n\n As shown in Figure 7.3(a), between 16 and 31 Hz, the PAS signal \namplitude for SR-42 in both vertical and powder compressed samples \nchange with modulation frequency as 9314.0?f  and 8633.0?f , \nrespectively.

Results of thermal diffusivity and predicted porosity \n The results show that independently of the well of origin for all \nseal rocks grinded and compressed to 6 tf/in2 samples there was a small \nreduction in the thermal diffusivity when compared to the values \nobtained from the original rocks (vertical sliced pellets). On the other \nhand, compared to each other the three samples present different thermal \ndiffusivity values increasing from the sample SR-57 to SR-47 (similar to \nSR-42). These results suggest that these samples originating from \ndistinct wells are constituted of specific microstructure organizations \nand crystalline and amorphous mineralogical phases which lead to rather \ndifferent thermal properties, especially in sample SR-57 from which \nvery low diffusivity values were obtained (in the order of 0.02 cm2/s). \n Firstly, to discuss the reduction of the thermal diffusivity values \nof the powder compressed samples compared to the vertical sliced \npellets we will base our argumentation towards a macroscopic property \ndescription of a disordered media having two main volume phases: \npores and solid matrix. By considering the vertical sliced sample (an \noriginal piece of clean and dry seal rock) as a two-phase network in \nwhich pores are randomly embedded in a solid matrix, the thermal \ndiffusivity of the specimen can be given as: \n\n          m p m p px? ? ?+ ? =  (7.1) \nwhere ?m+p and ?m are the thermal diffusivity of the vertical sample \ncomprised by solid matrix and pores and the powder compressed \nsamples containing only the solid matrix. ?p is the thermal diffusivity of \nthe pores network in this case considered to be filled by air and equal to \n0.19 cm2/s; xp finally is the amount of pores embedded in the solid \nmatrix of vertical sliced sample, i.e. the porosity value. Using Eq. (7.1), \none can obtain the porosity of SR-42 equal 6.38% from the thermal \ndiffusion results and 9.05% from the thermal bending; for sample SR-47 \na value of 6.00% was found from the thermal bending and for sample \nSR-57 a value of 1.42% was calculated. These values of porosity were \ncompared with the results obtained in the same rock samples using the \ncombination of nitrogen gas adsorption and mercury injection capillary \nporosimetry techniques in a previous work (SCHMITT, 2009) as can be \nseen in Figure 7.5. In this previous work it was concluded that much of \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             183 \n\nthe observed variations in permeability of analyzed seal rocks could be \nattributed to variations in porosity. However shale (as seal rocks) also \nexhibit wide ranges in fabric and clay content. Anisotropy in transport \nproperties may be pronounced in clay-bearing and soils which revel \ngrain shape alignments (KWON et al., 2004). The mineralogy, texture \nand grains orientation are discussed in the next paragraph.  Table 7.1 \nshows the comparison of porosity results presenting a good agreement \nbetween the techniques. Therefore it can be concluded that the PAS \ntechnique proves to be an alternative method for the calculation of \nporosity in seal rocks. \n\n \nFigure 7.5: PSD and porosity obtained for the analyzed seal rocks using the \n\ncombination of N2GA and MICP techniques (SCHMITT, 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n184              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nTable 7.1: Results obtained from PAS measurements; porosity and density \nvalues obtained by N2GA and MICP techniques and; values of thermal \n\ndiffusivity for common materials and elements. \n\n \n\nN\nam\n\ne\nSt\n\nat\ne\n\nl  \n   \n\n  \n(?\n\nm\n) \n\nR\nan\n\nge\n \n\n(H\nz)\n\nC\noe\n\nf. \na\n\nav\ner\n\nag\ne\n\n?\ns \n\n(c\nm\n\n2 /\ns)\n\nR\nan\n\nge\n \n\n(H\nz)\n\nC\noe\n\nf. \n   \n\nf\n?\n\ns \n\n(c\nm\n\n2 /\ns)\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n51\n0\n\n10\n-1\n\n7\n0.\n\n30\n39\n\n0.\n08\n\n84\n8\n\n16\n-3\n\n1\nf-\n\n-0\n.9\n\n31\n0.\n\n08\n28\n\n9\nSh\n\nal\ne\n\n0.\n01\n\n9\n\npo\nw\n\nde\nr\n\n50\n0\n\n8-\n15\n\n0.\n32\n\n07\n0.\n\n07\n63\n\n6\n16\n\n-3\n1\n\nf-\n-0\n\n.8\n63\n\n0.\n06\n\n57\nSa\n\nnd\nst\n\non\ne\n\n0.\n01\n\n2\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n47\n0\n\n19\n-3\n\n3\nf-\n\n-0\n.9\n\n82\n0.\n\n09\n29\n\n8\nQ\n\nua\nrt\n\nz\n0.\n\n07\n2\n\npo\nw\n\nde\nr\n\n51\n0\n\n21\n-2\n\n9\nf-\n\n-0\n.9\n\n95\n0.\n\n08\n15\n\n8\nFe\n\n0.\n23\n\nve\nrt\n\nic\nal\n\n39\n0\n\nf c\n=4\n\n.0\n53\n\n0.\n01\n\n93\n7\n\nA\nl\n\n0.\n84\n\npo\nw\n\nde\nr\n\n47\n5\n\n1-\n6\n\n0.\n65\n\n20\n0.\n\n01\n66\n\n7\nA\n\nir\n0.\n\n19\n\n?bulk (g/cm\n3\n)\n\nN\n2G\n\nA\n+M\n\nIC\nP\n\n2.\n55\n\nSa\nm\n\npl\nes\n\nT\nhe\n\nrm\nal\n\n D\nif\n\nfu\nsi\n\non\n   \n\n  \n(T\n\nD\n)\n\nT\nhe\n\nrm\noe\n\nla\nst\n\nic\n B\n\nen\ndi\n\nng\n \n\n(T\nB\n\n)\n\n?real (g/cm\n3\n)\n\n2.\n83\n\n2.\n66\n\nSR\n-4\n\n7\n6.\n\n00\n4.\n\n95\n2.\n\n62\n2.\n\n71\n\nSR\n-4\n\n2\n6.\n\n38\n \n\n(T\nD\n\n)  \n \n\n9.\n05\n\n \n(T\n\nB\n)\n\n4.\n60\n\n2.\n87\n\n?\ns\n (c\n\nm\n2 /\n\ns)\n\nP\nA\n\nS \nT\n\nec\nhn\n\niq\nue\n\nPorosity (%)\n\nPorosity (%)\n\nL\nit\n\ner\nat\n\nur\ne\n\n (G\nU\n\nIM\nA\n\nR\n\u00c3\n\nE\nS,\n\n 2\n01\n\n3)\n   \n\n   \n  \n\n(B\nR\n\nO\nW\n\nN\n a\n\nnd\n M\n\nA\nR\n\nC\nO\n\n, 1\n95\n\n8)\n \n\n(W\nA\n\nN\nG\n\n a\nnd\n\n M\nA\n\nN\nD\n\nE\nLL\n\nS,\n 1\n\n99\n9)\n\n \n\nSR\n-5\n\n7\n1.\n\n42\n1.\n\n48\n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             185 \n\n7.4.

By comparing the identification and the \nquantification of the phase structures one can see that mostly, each of \nthem is present in all the three wells although the amounts differ \nslightly. However, by comparing the recorded XRD diffraction patterns \nin Figure 7.6 important characteristics can be observed: all the peaks \nassociated with the phases in SR-57 are sharper then in SR-42 and SR-\n47 indicating a better crystallinity in this sample; The XRD patterns of \nthe SR-42 and SR-47 samples are very similar and show peaks with an \nenlarged base, suggesting that these samples present a bigger amount of \ndisorder such as amorphous phases like pores or clays (FARRAND and \nSINGER, 1990) then sample SR-57. \n There are numerous theoretical and experimental studies in the \nliterature showing that the thermal conductivity is proportional to \nthermal diffusivity, see Eq. (3.25), and lessens with decreasing grain \nsize (ZHONG and WANG, 2006; BODAPATI et al., 2006). In the \npresent study this fact was observed for sample SR-57 having a smaller \nthermal diffusivity then SR-42 and SR-47. The microstructure of seal \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n188              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nrock samples is constituted by the crystalline and amorphous \nmineralogical phases. We believe that the amorphous phase (like pores \nand hardly crystalline clays) located among the grain matrix particles, \nhas a considerable influence in the thermal diffusivity value. Some \nmaterials, including rocks, exhibit macroscopic thermal anisotropy; for \nexample, different numerical values for thermal conductivity result from \nmeasurements across different pairs of opposing faces on a sample of \nthe material (pellets with micro thickness in the micrometer order in our \ncase). The simplest type of thermal anisotropy, common in rocks, arises \nwhen the material has a layered structure at fine scales. The thermal \nconductivity in the direction perpendicular to the layering is generally \nlower than the conductivity in any direction parallel to the layering \n(CHEKHONIN, et al., 2012). This layered structure is strongly present \nin sample SR-57 as can be seen in the FESEM analysis on fractured \nFigure 7.8(a) and polished samples Figure 7.8(b). For samples SR-42 \nand SR-47 this characteristic of layered structures is much smaller and \nthe matrix grains are much bigger compared to SR-57. Besides that, \nsamples SR-42 and SR-47 show some sort of fractures/pores that are not \naligned to the bedding direction (see column b). Due to a chemical and \nmicrostructural disorder present in the amorphous SR-42 and SR-47 \nphases the pores and clays appeared among the rock matrix particles \nmight create temperature gradients inside the sample. These temperature \ngradients are responsible for the predominance of the thermoelastic \nbending process in the PAS signal amplitude and phase signals observed \nfor samples SR42 and SR-47. The small difference between the thermal \ndiffusivity values for these two samples even originating from distinct \nwells suggests that the amorphous phases and lattice mismatch (a result \nof the coexistence of the numerous crystalline phases from the rock \nmatrix) have similar effects on the propagation of thermal waves in the \nsamples SR-42 and SR-47. On the other hand, the lesser amount of \namorphous phase component present in the sample SR-57 and the \nsmaller grain sizes with preferential direction (vertical to bedding) are \nthe mainly responsible for the reduction of the thermal diffusivity of this \nwell formation. \n \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             189 \n\n \n                     (a)                                                     (b)                                   (c)\n\nFigure 7.8: Mineral content, pore microstructure and rock aspects of the \nthree analyzed seal rocks: Field Emission SEM analysis on fractured (a) and \n\npolished surface (b) samples; macrography of analyzed rocks. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n190              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n8. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK \n The distribution of pores and its morphologies in sedimentary \nrocks such as tight gas sandstones and seal rocks play essential roles in \ncharacterizing gas and oil reservoirs to predict the flux transport inside \nthese underground deposits. This work focused on the pore-structure \ncharacterization of low-permeability TGS and seal rocks, providing an \noverview of techniques and methodologies which can be applied to \ninvestigate the geological evolution and properties of the reservoirs \nsystems reflected mainly by their pore organization. \n Understanding that considerable volumes of hydrocarbons are \ntrapped in tight gas reservoirs onshore/offshore basins, some attempts \nhave been made to find an explanation of the stress-dependence porosity \nand permeability behavior of these rocks. TGS represent one type of gas \naccumulations generally referred to as unconventional reservoirs due to \ntheir significantly lower permeability and the attendant operational \nchallenges for achieving viable production rates and recovery volumes. \nIn order to relate the overall flow behavior to the average geometrical \ncharacteristics of the rocks, we must consider carefully certain statistical \naspects of the microscopic flow through individual pores or regions of \ninhomogeneity. In the first two chapters of this thesis we obtained by a \ncompendium of techniques results for the pore structure characterization \nand the analysis of the petrophysical properties on tight gas sandstones. \nBy the usage of distinct techniques it was possible to evaluate the \nbenefits and limitations of each method and consequently obtain specific \nproperties in these rocks which allowed us to estimate and simulate \npermeability. \n TGS originating from distinct gas fields were investigated by \nPDP, N2GA and MICP techniques to measure experimentally \npermeability and pore structure information. The device used for the \nmeasurements of permeability by the transient method was a CoreLab \nPDP-200 inserting nitrogen gas through the bedding plane (in the \nhorizontal or vertical directions) into samples of TGS plugs. Thus the \ndependence of transverse flow permeability could be investigated and \nalso the Klinkenberg\u2019 corrections could be obtained. For such low-\npermeability rocks the slip flow regime was present and Klinkenberg\u2019 \ncorrections lead us to reach the absolute permeability values of analyzed \nsamples. Also the PDP equipment had its accuracy validated by \ncomparing results of steady-state versus pulse-decay permeability. By \nevaluating the permeability values of these rocks under compression and \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             191 \n\ndecreasing porosity level by increasing the confining pressure in the \ncore holder, we found it to be smaller, regarding the absolute values of \npermeability, as higher the value of the applied net stress (dependence \non porosity and clay content). The two analyzed samples of field D \nshowed a dependence of 0.80330.2341k P?=  and 0.72510.0854k P?= . \nSamples of field A having considerable amount of calcite were fitted by \nthe equations 0.0018 ( ) 0.0073k Ln P= ? +  and 0.42330.0032k P?= , while \nsample A-17V having the pores filled by clay content showed a \ndependence of 0.35910.0347k P?= . For all samples the net stress is given \nin MPa. The application of PDP technique demonstrated the potential of \nutilizing the transient method for solving fluid flow in unconventional \nreservoirs and allowed us to have measured permeability values which \nwere the basis for validating the distinct permeability correlations \napplied in this work. The N2GA method, performed in an ASAP-2020 \nAnalyzer-Micrometrics, showed primary experimental curves identified \nas adsorption/desorption isotherms of type II for all the TGS analyzed, \nthough the hysteresis loops were dissimilar between distinct reservoirs \ninvestigated. The main textural parameters (surface area, pore volume \nand pore size distribution) in the micro and mesoporous range were \nassessed using five calculation methods from N2GA technique: \nLangmuir and BET models for surface area calculation; BJH, \nDollimore-Heal and DFT theory for pore volume calculations. The \ncalculated values of the specific surface area using the Langmuir method \nwere higher than those of BET due to its monolayer approach as \nexplained in section 5.2.5. In this case more accurate BET values were \nbetween: 0.75 and 1.56 m2/g for TGS of field A; 1.61 and 2.21 m2/g for \nfield B; 4.93 and 11.65 m2/g for field C. Although the PSD derived from \nBJH and Dollimore-Heal adsorption models were very similar, we \nchoose only the BJH model to be used for the combination of N2GA and \nMICP techniques. The highest amounts of pore volumes measured by \nN2GA technique were found in the samples of field C, an outcrop which \nis made up by a considerably higher amount of microposity. The \nexperiments for the mercury capillary pressure curves were performed \nin an Autopore IV 9500 Micromeritics and in combination with the \nN2GA results provided the main information about porosity and pore \nsize distributions used for the investigation of permeability predictions \nand comparison of results obtained by the application of the \ncompendium of techniques in TGS. The values of density obtained for \neach rock sample and used for the porosity conversion were measured \nby MICP.  \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n192              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\n Low-field NMR measurements showed to be an import tool for \nthe porosity and PSD quantification as well as permeability predictions \nfor the investigated low-permeability TGS rocks of field A. After \nkeeping the sample to be 100% brine saturated for about 1 week, the \nexperiments were obtained rapidly, in about a half hour on cleaned state \nmini-core samples. NMR measurements using low magnetic fields in \nTGS of field A have given accurate porosity values and reasonable \nagreements with T2 distributions and correspond to pore size \ndistributions from mercury porosimetry. Differently than the values of \nT2cutoff found in the literature for sandstones (33 ms) and carbonates (92 \nms) the analyzed TGS rocks displayed values between 2 and 5 ms. The \nT2cutoff value is the boundary between the Bulk Volume Irreducible \n(BVI), comprised by clay- and capillary-bound water, and the Free Fluid \nIndex (FFI). In our work we considered the value of BVI to be the much \ndefined first peak in the lower region of transverse relaxation time \ncurve. As we observed in the analyzed samples from field A, the choice \nof a fixed T2cutoff may not represent this boundary once that it is higly \ndepend on lithology and changes considerable from distinct depths in a \nreservoir. Also the T2gm values (the geometric mean of the relaxation \nspectra) was calculated to predict permeability using the Mean-T2 \nmodel and were between 1.26 and 20.3 ms. The parameter b and C from \nthe Mean-T2 and Coates 1999 models were refined based on the \nexperimental PDP results. The values adjusted for b were between 0.72 \nand 39.48 increasing with decreasing of porosity, while the values fitted \nfor C tended to increase with porosity and were between 15.63 and \n41.89.  \n By analyzing the 3D volumes reconstructed from integrated slices \nand view processes, researchers made quantitative estimations of pore \nbodies and characteristic connected lengths in samples. From the results \nof X-ray nano- and microCT measurements performed in the TGS of \nwell A we were able to quantify porosity and PSD in distinct scales. \nTwo methods were applied for the extraction of a 3D pore-network, \nmathematical morphology and equivalent resistor (skeleton). Using both \nmethods we integrated the scales to obtain total porosity and PSD in 3D \nmulti-scale. We observed that when the frequency number of pore sizes \nis used to integrate the scales, more reliable results were obtained. The \ncurves of incremental and cumulative pore volumes from the \nN2GA+MICP combination and from the low-field NMR measurements \nwere used to compare the results of the 3D X-ray multi-scale. \nAdditionally, important pore structure parameters for permeability \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             193 \n\nestimation were measured and discussed on samples A-11V and A-17V. \nFrom the results of porosity and PSD curves (measured by \nN2GA+MICP and low-field NMR) and from the textural analyses \n(performed by XRD and SEM/FEM) we considered that TGS of field A \ncould be divided in an upper and a lower region with distinct \nmicrostructures, respectively represented by samples A-11V and A-17V. \nThese measured parameters were: connectivity, tortuosity and shape \nfactors, specific surface area (So), aspect ratio, phi and theta orientations. \nWe observed that the tortuosity and shape factor values increased with \ndecreasing porosity and depth location. The results of So from the 3D \nimage analysis (IA) were at least by one decimal order smaller than \nthose of the BET results. This fact is expected because in the N2GA \nanalysis using BET method, the molecules of nitrogen reach even the \nsub-micron pores adding surface area to the final result, while in IA the \nresults are limited to the image resolution. For both analyzed samples \n(A-11V and A-17V) the So determined by X-ray CT in the Res2 was \nhigher than Res1 (poorest resolution). The phi and theta orientations \nanalysis provided the information for both samples A-11V and A-17V \nthat there is a preferred orientation of pores to the X- and Y-axis. \nTransposing these results to the macro-scale of the reservoir one could \naffirm that the horizontal hydrocarbons prospection would be favorable \nin the horizontal bedding direction in the regions of the reservoirs from \nwhere A-11V and A-17V were extracted. This evidence was confirmed \nby the experimental permeability measurements and also by simulated \npermeability values obtained in each the X-, Y- and Z-axis directions \nfrom the generated equivalent resistor. The simulations of single-phase \nflow across the generated 3D pore structure, though, were in an \nunreasonable level of agreement to the PDP permeability results. \nNevertheless, the effort expended towards relating the calculated values \nof tortuosity and shape factors, geometrical and topological attribute of \npore space, lead to the prediction of more accurate permeability values \nusing the Kozeny-Carman model. We observed that from the \nSEM/FESEM to the nano- and microCT analyses, considerable \nmicrostructural information (pore morphology and especially clay \ncontent) was lost. We attribute this loss mainly to the low spatial \nresolution of microCT and to the sample size limitation when a high \nresolution of 0.064 ?m is achieved in the nanoCT. In the nanoCT \nacquisition only a very small sample (volume and mass around \n5.66E+04 ?m3 and 4.E-07 g, respectively) subjected to a randomly \ncutting place is manufactured. So for very heterogeneous samples such \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n194              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nas the analyzed TGS A-11V and A-17V (see e.g Figure 6.31 and Figure \n6.32) the usage of nanoCT proceeding would need to be carried in a \nstatistical level, i.e. acquisition of many volume regions, meticulous \nwork to be conceded. In fact, the dimensions of the pores and their \nconnectivity are so small that they change the physics of gas behavior \nneeded for reservoir simulators. Another factor which accounts for the \ndistinction between measured and simulated permeability is the net \nstress pressure applied to the sample under PDP analysis; this condition \nis needed to perform the same pressure conditions from the original \nfield. However, while performing a nano- and microCT acquisition only \nthe atmospheric pressure is applied on the analyzed sample. In brief, the \npresence of high content of clay filling pores and also the existence of \nvery small pores below the range of the analyzed image resolutions, \ncreate an obstacle to the segmentation process due to the unsolved grey-\nlevel distribution. As a result, the segmented pore vessels tend to be \nwider then they truly are. Obtaining such detailed properties of the pore \nmorphologies information on TGS reservoir rocks would be very \ndifficult by usage of direct experiments or conventional techniques and \neven in the nowadays 3D high resolution techniques. Nano- and \nmicroCT imaging technology is a new technique that provides valuable \ninformation about the 3D microstructure of TGS. The ability to \ncharacterize the pore structure of TGS in distinct scales, a very new \ntopic, enables improved estimations of porosity and a better \nunderstanding of the pore network and structural pore parameters in the \nreservoir rock. Also the insights gleaned from this study using nano- and \nmicroCT images to simulate permeability in very low-permeability \nrocks such as TGS, have made the need to modify and develop new \nmodels for these rocks obvious. Ultimately, 3D X-ray CT technology is \na gateway to investigate quantitatively the pore network and the pore \nmorphologies in tight gas sandstones, as we observed for our rocks. \n In the last part of this work we have shown a new method to \nmeasure the thermal diffusivity coefficient and porosity through \nmuscovite-, biotite-, chamosite- and clinochlore-rich seal rocks. In this \nstudy, the measurements were performed at room temperature and \natmospheric pressure, looking on the photoacoustic spectroscopy \ntechnique (PAS) applied in an open photoacoustic cell (OPC). This new \nmethodology has the advantage of being simple and of low costs, \nbesides it needs only a small piece (1 x 1 cm) of the sample to be \nanalyzed. In principle, the technique is applicable to all materials and in \nour knowledge was never applied in seal rocks from petroleum industry \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \nMayka Schmitt                                                             195 \n\nbefore. We found from the PAS analysis that only the thermal diffusion \nand the thermoelastic bending mechanisms were present in the analyzed \nseal rocks. Measuring the thermal diffusivity of seal rocks from distinct \nwells we can determine the influence of each rock on the generation and \npreservation of oil and gas. By the support of the FESEM and XRD \nanalyses, the PAS results allowed us to draw three main conclusions. \nFirstly, the thermal diffusivity of seal rocks from the distinct Brazilian \nfields ranges from 0.01667 to 0.09298 cm2/s. Secondly, a strong \ncorrelation of thermal diffusivity with chemical composition and crystal \norientation was observed. For sample SR-57 values of the thermal \ndiffusivity were found to be in almost one order smaller then for \nsamples SR-42 and SR-47. This fact was attributed to a better \ncrystallization, preferential crystal orientation (vertical to bedding) and \nsmaller grain sizes in sample SR-57. This rock is considered, therefore, \na better thermal insulator compared to the other two samples. \nNevertheless, in addition to being nonporous and non-permeable cap \nrocks, combined with the stable nature of each analyzed seal rock we \ncan assume that these samples make good trapping to oil and gas \nreservoirs and are conductive to petroleum generation as well as \npreservation. Lastly, it was possible to predict very low porosity from \nseal rocks (between 1.42 to 9.05%) by usage of the PAS technique. This \napproach was reached by the proposed correlation of the measured \nthermal diffusivity on cleaned vertical-cutted samples (having the \ninfluence of porosity) and powder-compressed samples (with only the \nrock matrix influence). The results show that thermal diffusivity \ndeclines as apparent porosity of samples decreases. The PAS method, \nalthough simple, is useful in estimating the thermal diffusivity and \nporosity of seal rocks with accuracy and has the advantage that it avoids \nthe use of complicated experimental setups.  \n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH \n\n- Evaluation of pore properties using N2 gas adsorption applied \nin distinct samples state (size and amount of mass) of a same \nmaterial; \n\n- 3D quantification of mineralogical phases in TGS using X-\nray CT technique; \n\n- Application of the Series-Parallel model using PSD results \nobtained by the multi-scale 3D X-ray CT images to compare \nwith the results obtained by the N2GA+MICP combination. \n\n\n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________ \n196              Ph.D Thesis (PGMAT-UFSC) \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n\nADAMSON, A.
