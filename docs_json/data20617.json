FORMOSO*\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis work is an application of the 14C-Polymethylmethacrylate method to compare the porosity evolution between unal-\n\ntered and propylitic-altered granites, using samples from Lavras do Sul region, Brazil. This method, when coupled with\n\noptical and electronic petrography has the advantage over other methods to provide the quantification and identification\n\nof total and local porosity of rocks. From petrographic observations, different kinds of porous zones were identified\n\nand quantified (microfractures, grain boundaries, alteration of minerals, etc). Results show that unaltered granites\n\nhave 0.5 to 0.6% porosity and propylitic-altered ones have 1.7 to 1.8% porosity, even between samples with different\n\ntextures. Porosity of altered rocks increases mainly due to higher porosity of neoformed chlorite, calcite, sericite and\n\nmicrofractures. Field observations show that later phyllic alteration halos are wider in equigranular than in porphyritic\n\ngranites, which could not be explained by different original porosity between those rocks. The observed differences\n\nof phyllic halos diffusion were controlled by structural and fluid/rock ratio variations between the equigranular and\n\nporphyritic granitic facies during the later hydrothermal stage.\n\nKey words: porosity quantification, 14C-PMMA method, granite porosity, hydrothermal alteration, propylitic\nalteration, Lavras do Sul.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMethodologies for rock porosity quantification like wa-\n\nter impregnation, mercury injection, fluorescent resin im-\n\npregnation and gas adsorption in different kinds of rocks\n\nhave been developed in the last decades (Dubois et al.\n\n1998, Schild et al. 2001, Yue et al. 2004). These meth-\n\nods however, have reasonable resolutions only for total\n\nrock porosity. The 14C-Polymethylmethacrylate (14C-\n\n*Member Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias\nCorrespondence to: Everton Marques Bongiolo\nE-mail: embongiolo@hotmail.com\n\nPMMA) method has the advantage over those methods\n\nbecause it provides also the porosity quantification of se-\n\nlected areas of the rock surface (Hellmuth et al. 1993).\n\nWhen coupled with petrographic data and image analy-\n\nsis, it is possible to recognize the petrophysical charac-\n\nteristics of its associated sites (Oila et al. 2005, Sardini\n\net al. 2006).\n\nThe recognition and quantification of rock poros-\n\nity are important for the following reasons (Schild et al.\n\n2001): (1) evolution (propagation and coalescence) of\n\nmicrocracks controls the mechanical behavior of brittle\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\n504 EVERTON M. BONGIOLO et al.\n\nregimes; (2) porous zones are pathways for fluid flow\n\nand solute diffusion and (3) orientation of microfissures\n\ncontrols the anisotropy of petrophysical and mechanical\n\nproperties of rocks that can indicate stress regimes. In\n\nhydrothermal systems, porosity quantification of altered\n\nand unaltered rocks can be used as a tool for prevision of\n\nfluid/rock ratio and for recognition and quantification of\n\npathways controlling hydrothermal alteration.\n\nThe Lavras do Sul Gold Mining District (LD) com-\n\nprises hydrothermally altered Au-Cu (\u00b1 Pb, Zn, Ag)-\nbearing prospects hosted in Neoproterozoic granitic and\n\nvolcanogenic sequence, located near the town of Lavras\n\ndo Sul, Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), southernmost\n\nBrazil (Fig. 1). The major gold mineralizations (0.4 to\n\n5 ppm) are located in N40?E to E\u2013W quartz + diocta-\nhedral phyllosilicates + pyrite (\u00b1 chalcopyrite) veins and\nbreccia and their related alteration halos. These highly al-\n\ntered and deformed zones are associated to an alteration\n\nstage (phyllic alteration) that superimposes initially unal-\n\ntered and propylitic (pervasive alteration) altered rocks.\n\nThe granitic complex which hosts the mineraliza-\n\ntions is characterized by a reverse zonation of its geo-\n\nchemical and petrographic features, called central, trans-\n\nitional and border facies (Nardi and Lima 1985). The\n\ncentral facies comprises shoshonitic rapakivi coarse-\n\ngrained porphyritic granodiorites and monzogranites,\n\nwhile the border facies hosts mainly alkaline coarse-\n\ngrained equigranular perthite granites. The transitional\n\nfacies comprises textural and geochemical hybrid rocks\n\n(monzo and syenogranites) generated by partial assim-\n\nilation of the central facies by the border one (Nardi\n\nand Lima 1985). The occurrence of microgranular mafic\n\nenclaves (MME) attests a coeval mafic magmatism\n\nwith both central and border granitoids (Nardi and Lima\n\n2000), besides swarms of enclaves are more likely found\n\nin the transitional and border granitic facies.\n\nIt is known from field observations and borehole\n\ndescriptions (E.M. Bongiolo, unpublished data) that dif-\n\nfusion of hydrothermal alteration halos around veins\n\n(phyllic alteration) is quite different between the granitic\n\nfacies. Perthite granites from border facies have com-\n\nmonly wider halos (up to 40 m width) than rapakivi\n\ngranites from the central facies (&lt;10 m width), although\n\nphyllic alteration was probably produced at the same\n\ntime in both facies, as they have similar 595 \u00b1 5 Ma\n\nmagmatic age (Remus et al. 2000) and structural ori-\n\nentation of later mineralized veins associated to phyllic\n\nalteration.\n\nThe aims of the present contribution are (1) to com-\n\npare the evolution of porosity between unaltered and\n\npropylitic-altered granitic rocks using samples from\n\nLavras do Sul area and (2) to test the influence of primary\n\nporosity of rocks on the diffusion (width) of later phyl-\n\nlic alteration halos around veins from different granitic\n\nfacies. The 14C-polymethylmethacrylate (14C-PMMA)\n\nmethod, coupled with detailed petrographic and digital\n\nimage processing studies were carried out to identify and\n\nquantify the micrometer to decimeter porosity hetero-\n\ngeneities of rocks from central and border granitic facies\n\nand to compare the obtained results with field data.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nIt was selected four granitic rock samples of drill cores\n\nfrom Bloco do Buti\u00e1 (sample A) and Valdo Teixeira (sam-\n\nples C and D) prospects and of a surface quarry from\n\nCerrito (sample B) prospect (Fig. 1B).\n\nSamples A and B represent original or near unal-\n\ntered rocks with contrasting compositions and textures\n\n(border and central granitic facies respectively) that hosts\n\ndifferent alteration halos width of later phyllic alteration.\n\nThey were collected in zones where fractures and faults\n\nare not observed. Samples C and D represent avail-\n\nable boreholes comprising propylitic-altered rocks (bor-\n\nder granitic facies) of contrasting texture, i.e. associated\n\nto an intermediate (pervasive) alteration stage between\n\nunaltered and highly altered rocks. They were collected\n\nin altered zones near structurally controlled quartz veins\n\nfrom Valdo Teixeira prospect, but with weak or no influ-\n\nence of later alteration halos.\n\nTHE 14 C-POLYMETHYLMETHACRYLATE\n\n(14 C-PMMA) METHOD\n\nThe 14C-PMMA method developed by Hellmuth et al.\n\n(1993) consists in sample impregnation with 14C-MMA\n\nunder vacuum, polymerization by irradiation and au-\n\ntoradiography of sample surface. A bidimensional (2D)\n\nporosity image is obtained and optical density and poros-\n\nity calculations were performed on samples using digital\n\nimage processing techniques.\n\nThe methylmethacrylate (MMA) monomer is a po-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\nQUANTIFICATION OF GRANITE POROSITY 14C-PMMA METHOD 505\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Simplified geological map of the Lavras do Sul region.

The 14C low-energy (maximum\n\n155 keV) and its 5360 years half-life yields good autora-\n\ndiographic resolutions for rocks submitted to long time\n\nimpregnation.\n\nThe core samples were sawed and dried in a vacuum\n\nchamber (T = 90 to 114?C) during 10 days. The drying\nprocess is very important, because the MMA molecule\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\n506 EVERTON M. BONGIOLO et al.\n\nhas a hydrophobic characteristic that inhibits its com-\n\nplete infiltration in rocks when water is present. This\n\nstep was followed by the impregnation of samples with\n14C-MMA in the same vacuum chamber during 21 days.\n\nAfter that, the 14C-MMA impregnated in samples was\n\npolymerized (fixed in the rock matrix) during 8 days,\n\nwhich consists in ? -ray irradiation (total dose: 77 kGy)\n\nusing a 60Co source. The initial concentration of the\n14C-MMA tracer used in this study was 0.5 MBq/ml.\n\nThin sections of impregnated rock fragments were pro-\n\nduced for petrographic observations of the similar areas\n\nand to obtain an estimative of the volume (%) of mineral\n\nphases present in each sample by point counting (1500\n\npoints). A better quantification of mafic mineral contents\n\nin exactly the same areas used for porosity quantification\n\nof unaltered rocks was performed digitally on JPEG im-\n\nages after selective staining techniques (see below) using\n\nAdobe Photoshop? software. The main petrographic\ncharacteristics and the mineral content in each sample\n\nare summarized on Table I. The sawn surface of rock\n\nsamples was polished (1/4 \u00b5m) and cleaned ultrason-\n\nically for 3 minutes to obtain very plane surfaces be-\n\nfore to perform the autoradiography exposition. After\n\nperformed the autoradiography, the plane surfaces were\n\ncovered with carbon to obtain additional petrographic\n\nobservations directly on the rock, using a Jeol JSM-5800\n\nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with an\n\nEDS quantitative analyzer.\n\nThe autoradiography method is based on detection\n\nof radiation with nuclear emulsions. The sensibility of\n\nthe autoradiographic film is a function of exposition\n\ntime, activity of the radiation target and the blacken-\n\ning of the photographic film (Hellmuth et al. 1993). A\n\nKodak? X-OMAT MA film (20 \u00b5m resolution) was used\nwith the impregnated samples and together with 14C-\n\nPMMA calibration series (5.1356\u20133 to 97.535\u20133 MBq/ml\n\nactivities). These patterns are used to calculate the cali-\n\nbration function for quantitative analyses of rock poros-\n\nity (Hellmuth et al. 1993). The exposition time of rock\n\nsamples and thin sections was 5 days. The obtained au-\n\ntoradiographies were digitalized in BMP grey level (8\n\nbit), using transparent option and a resolution of 1200\n\ndpi (each pixel is 21.2 \u00b5m2) using a UMAX Power Look\n\nIII scanner.\n\nTHEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS OF POROSITY\n\nCALCULATION\n\nThe porosity quantification is based on the assumption\n\nthat optical densities on autoradiographies are propor-\n\ntional to the decaying isotope contents in the studied ma-\n\nterial (Hellmuth et al. 1993, Oila et al. 2005).\n\nThe rock porosity calculation using the autoradio-\n\ngraphies comprises the following steps:\n\n\u2013 initially all grey-levels intensities (I ) and its related\n\nbackground (I0) are determined digitally in several\n\nareas of the sample;\n\n\u2013 the optic densities (D) are calculated using the\n\nLambert-Beer law (Equation 1) and lately converted\n\ninto activities ( A) using Microcal Origin? soft-\nware. This software provides a calibration curve\n\nbased on interactive calculation using tree param-\n\neters: the k correction factor, the minimum opti-\n\ncal density (D0) and the maximum optical density\n\n(Dmax ) shown in equation 2 (Treutler and Freyer\n\n1988);\n\n\u2013 the activities are then converted to porosities us-\n\ning the Autoradio\u00a9 software (D. Pr\u00eat, unpublished\n\ndata).\n\nD = ? log\n(\n\nI\n\nI0\n\n)\n(1)\n\nA =\n( ?1\n\nk\n\n)\nln\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n(\nD ? D0\n\nDmax\n\n)]\n(2)\n\nThe quantitative porosity measurement is based on\n\nthe assumption that the rock matrix dilutes the 14C-\n\nPMMA. If the pore sizes are under the resolution of\n\nthe autoradiography (usually > 0.1 \u00b5m), the major frac-\n\ntion of the emitted ?-radiation is attenuated by the rock\n\nand the porosity calculation is applicable. The local rock\n\nporosity (?) is obtained by the calculation of the 14C\n\ntracer contents in an analyzed area (Equation 3):\n\n?% = ?\n(\n\nA\n\nA0\n\n)\n100% (3)\n\nwhere A is the specific activity of an individual pixel\n\n(MBq/ml), A0 is the tracer initial specific activity\n\n(0.5 MBq/ml) and ? is the correction factor to ?-parti-\n\ncles absorption from the rock showed in equation 4:\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\nQUANTIFICATION OF GRANITE POROSITY 14C-PMMA METHOD 507\n\nTABLE I\nLocation, classification, texture features and mineral contents from each sample obtained by point counting\n\n(1500 points) of thin sections.

As mafic minerals\n\nare highly susceptible to alteration, this technique had\n\nthe aim to test the influence of different mafic contents\n\non total porosity of unaltered rocks. Altered rocks were\n\nexcluded from this process because staining techniques\n\nare similar for carbonates and mafic minerals. First, the\n\nsamples were etched with hydrofluoric acid during 30\n\nseconds, washed with distilled water, immersed in a K-\n\nferrocyanide solution (M\u00fcller 1967) for 12 hours to stain\n\nthe ferro-magnesian minerals blue and dried at room tem-\n\nperature for 1 hour. Second, the colored surfaces were\n\netched with hydrofluoric acid during 30 seconds, washed\n\nwith distilled water, immersed in a Na-cobaltinitrite so-\n\nlution (Hutchison 1974) for 1 minute and dried at room\n\ntemperature for 1 hour. The latter step stain the feldspars\n\nyellow, plagioclase white and quartz grey and did not\n\naffect ferro-magnesian minerals that had already been\n\nstained.\n\nThe stained rock surfaces were digitalized in 24-\n\nbit RGB mode with high resolution in the same areas as\n\nthe autoradiographies. The four colors representing dif-\n\nferent minerals were color level adjusted and thresholded\n\nusing Adobe Photoshop? software to obtain a histogram\nof total modal contents of each color on rock surface\n\nareas. Biotite and amphibole contrast greatly with the\n\nsurrounding felsic minerals and can be extracted easily.\n\nAlkali feldspar, plagioclase and quartz contents in each\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\n508 EVERTON M. BONGIOLO et al.\n\nsample were individualized after threshold processes on\n\neach phase.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPETROGRAPHIC AND AUTORADIOGRAPHIC\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nFigure 2 shows the original (not treated) rock samples\n\n(A to D) and its corresponding autoradiographies (A\u2019 to\n\nD\u2019) of the same area. From autoradiography images of\n\nimpregnated samples, thin sections and SEM observa-\n\ntions, several types of pores were identified, i.e. these\n\ndata are used for porosity qualitative identification, be-\n\nfore quantification of total and local porosity of rocks.\n\nThe nomenclature of pore types follows the suggestion\n\nof Siitari-Kauppi (M. Siitari-Kauppi, unpublished data):\n\n(i) transgranular, that transect mineral grains; (ii) inter-\n\ngranular, represented by a connected network between\n\ngrains; and (iii) intragranular (inside grains), that can be\n\nfound connected to another pore type or isolated, as a\n\nresidual pore. It is also important to point out that rocks\n\nusually called \u201cunaltered\u201d have always minor amounts\n\nof secondary minerals, as observed in the studied sam-\n\nples (Table I).\n\nIn sample A, porous zones observed in the autora-\n\ndiography are mainly associated to transgranular and in-\n\ntragranular microfissures and wider patches of different\n\ngrey-level intensity. The transgranular microfissure net-\n\nwork predominates and is regularly distributed through\n\nthe equigranular sample, affecting all rock forming min-\n\nerals. These fissures are always unfilled or filled by a\n\nthin film of hematite. They have commonly homoge-\n\nneous grey level intensity in the autoradiography and\n\nlong linear forms with average 4 \u00b5m aperture. It can\n\nbe better observed on alkali feldspar and quartz grains,\n\ndue to volumetric predominance and lighter grey level\n\nof these minerals in the autoradiography image when\n\ncompared to microfissures. Intragranular porosity is as-\n\nsociated to linear microfissures with 2 to 3 \u00b5m aper-\n\nture, usually interconnected with transgranular ones that\n\nlocally coincide with cleavage plans of mafic minerals\n\n(Fig. 3A). Twin plans and perthitic exsolution structures\n\ndo not correspond to porous zones (Fig. 3B) and inter-\n\ngranular microfissures are observed only locally. Wide\n\npatches with mean grey level intensity in the autora-\n\ndiography were identified after petrographic studies as\n\namphibole and minor amounts of biotite with 0.8 to\n\n2 mm grain size and locally to slight sericitization of\n\nfeldspars. Different grey level are observed inside the\n\nlimits of mafic minerals: darker zones in the autora-\n\ndiography (higher porosity) represent high density of\n\nmicrofissures or alteration of amphibole (\u00b1 biotite) to\nchlorite through cleavage planes, sometimes associated\n\nto lesser amounts of calcite, hematite and pyrite. Lighter\n\nzones of lower porosity correspond to unaltered zones\n\nof the same minerals and to quartz inclusions.\n\nIn sample B, the porphyritic texture of the rock al-\n\nlows us to differentiate two main sites with visual con-\n\ntrasting porosity intensity on autoradiography: (i) phe-\n\nnocrysts (alkali feldspar) and (ii) matrix (alkali feldspar,\n\nplagioclase, quartz, amphibole and biotite). Both sites\n\ncomprise an interconnected network of randomly dis-\n\ntributed trans-, intra- and intergranular microfissures af-\n\nfecting all rock forming minerals. Transgranular mi-\n\ncrofissures are always unfilled or partly filled by a thin\n\nfilm of hematite. Phenocrysts represent ample lighter\n\nareas on the autoradiography, where transgranular and\n\nintragranular microcracks occur with linear forms with\n\naverage 3 \u00b5m aperture and intergranular microfissures\n\ncontour grain boundaries (? 3 \u00b5m aperture). The weak\nalteration of plagioclase from rapakivi mantling rims\n\nprovides a bad visual estimative of alkali feldspar phe-\n\nnocrysts contents on autoradiography image, as alkali\n\nfeldspar grains seems to be smaller (only the core is\n\ncompletely preserved) than they really are. The fine\n\ngrained matrix provides an interconnected network of\n\ntortuous intergranular microfissures with 1.5 to 8 \u00b5m\n\naperture (Fig. 3C), which yields a mean grey level inten-\n\nsity of the matrix in the autoradiography. This grey level\n\nintensity of the matrix is also provided by the presence\n\nof amphibole and biotite (in general &lt;0.6 mm size), usu-\n\nally less fractured and altered than in sample A, and in\n\nminor amounts to sericitization of plagioclase and slight\n\nalteration to chlorite and calcite. The intragranular mi-\n\ncrofissures of mafic minerals are mainly represented by\n\nopened cleavage plans with 1.3 to 4 \u00b5m width (Fig. 3D\n\nand E). Associated quartz and alkali feldspar represent\n\nalways the lower porosity minerals of the matrix on the\n\nautoradiography.\n\nDark dots are also a well marked porosity site, which\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\nQUANTIFICATION OF GRANITE POROSITY 14C-PMMA METHOD 509\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 Sawed sections of 14C-PMMA impregnated rock samples (left, A-D) and its corresponding autoradiographies (right, A\u2019-D\u2019).

High porosity (darker)\n\nzones are mainly associated to (i) microfissures and (ii)\n\nhydrothermal alteration of original rock forming miner-\n\nals.

It comprises a marked\n\nand connected network of trans-, intra- and intergranular\n\npores with contrasting forms and mineral fillings, de-\n\npending on rock texture.\n\nIn sample C, transgranular microfissures with 2 to\n\n4 \u00b5m aperture have linear to slightly tortuous forms in\n\nboth the rock matrix and phenocrysts (alkali feldspar\n\nand quartz). It is highly connected with a tight network\n\nof tortuous intergranular microfissures with 1 to 2 \u00b5m\n\naperture (Fig. 3G) that follows grain boundaries. In sam-\n\nple D, long linear transgranular microfissures with 2.5\n\nto 9 \u00b5m aperture (average 4 \u00b5m) predominates over\n\nall rock forming minerals, commonly connected with\n\na network of intragranular microfissures, besides minor\n\namounts of intergranular ones are locally observed.\n\nHydrothermal alteration over original (magmatic)\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\nQUANTIFICATION OF GRANITE POROSITY 14C-PMMA METHOD 511\n\nminerals and filling of microfissures is characteristic for\n\nsamples C and D, which allows the observation of ample\n\nareas with variable grey levels (and consequently poros-\n\nity) on autoradiographies. It is represented mainly by\n\nthe following secondary features:\n\n(a) pseudomorphic replacement of original mafic min-\n\nerals for chlorite (Fig. 3H) and sericite (\u00b1 calcite).\nThese minerals are associated to low grey level\n\n(high porosity) areas on autoradiographies and\n\nshows wider porosity paths in open cleavages (up\n\nto 12 \u00b5m aperture) than in samples A and B. They\n\nare locally aligned or in clusters that can form rims\n\naround feldspar grains;\n\n(b) destabilization of ilmenite (Fig. 3I), generate high\n\nporosity sites (up to 4 \u00b5m aperture) mainly in the\n\ncore of the crystals, which corresponds to dark\n\nzones on the autoradiography;\n\n(c) micro inclusions of hematite (Fig. 3J) or very fine\n\ngrained chlorite \u00b1 sericite \u00b1 calcite crystallization\nmark commonly the compositional zoning of mag-\n\nmatic alkali feldspars which correspond to medium\n\ngrey level intensity on autoradiography. These sec-\n\nondary phases were observed in either the border or\n\nthe core of feldspar grains as patches or over perthite\n\nexsolution structures;\n\n(d) calcite veinlets (Fig. 3K) with up to 150 \u00b5m width\n\nand very fine grained chlorite crystallized through\n\ninfillings of microfissures (Fig. 3L) represent the al-\n\nteration minerals in longer linear transgranular and\n\nin tortuous inter and intragranular porosity respec-\n\ntively;\n\n(e) mafic microgranular enclaves (MME) were ob-\n\nserved only locally on sample C. They are com-\n\npletely altered to chlorite \u00b1 sericite \u00b1 calcite and\nrepresents highly altered and porous zones. When\n\npresent, these petrographic sites increase the poros-\n\nity of the analyzed surface and comparison between\n\noriginal rock porosity would have no significance.\n\nFor that reason, zones containing MME were ex-\n\ncluded from total porosity quantification of that\n\nsample.\n\nMINERALOGY OF QUANTIFIED AREAS AFTER STAINING\n\nThe main rock-forming minerals observed in the stud-\n\nied samples were quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase and\n\nmafic minerals (amphibole and biotite). The mafic min-\n\neral contents calculated on binary (black and white) im-\n\nages of selected areas from samples A and B obtained\n\nafter digital threshold of stained surfaces are 7.4% and\n\n3.5% respectively (Fig. 4). Quantification of mafic min-\n\neral contents in altered samples by staining were not\n\nused, however they have similar values between por-\n\nphyritic (A and D, ?7%) and equigranular (B and C,\n?4%) samples. Tectosilicate contents (%) are Qz = 28.1\nand KF = 64.5 for sample A and Qz = 27.3, KF = 58.2\n\nand Pl = 11 for sample B.\n\nPOROSITY QUANTIFICATION\n\nTotal rock porosity of each sample was calculated using\n\nthe Autoradio\u00a9 software. In the image generated dur-\n\ning total rock porosity calculation (Fig. 5A\u2013D), small\n\nred points correspond to zones with very low porosity\n\n(near null) that were not computed. The correspond-\n\ning total rock porosity map (Fig. 5A\u2019\u2013D\u2019) is obtained\n\nafter transformation of the logarithmic ratio grey level of\n\nautoradiographies to a linear one, which is visually an\n\neasier way to compare between different porosity values\n\nin selected areas of the samples. However, this process\n\nof transformation generates an image with inverse tonal-\n\nity, when compared to the autoradiography, i.e. in this\n\ncase, black represent the lowest porosity areas and white\n\nthe highest porosity ones.\n\nCalculated values of connected porosity for 4.4 cm2\n\nrock surfaces are 0.5% for sample A, 0.6% for sample B,\n\n1.7% for sample C and 1.8% for sample D. The poros-\n\nity histograms of rocks represented in a log-linear scale\n\n(Fig. 6) show similarities between samples with the\n\nsame textural characteristics (porphyritic or equigranu-\n\nlar). Images from samples A and D have the highest\n\nquantity of pixels with 0.25% porosity and samples B\n\nand C with 0.35% porosity respectively. Porosity curves\n\nincreases up to 4% for unaltered rocks and up to 10%\n\nfor altered rocks.\n\nMicrofissure sites from samples A and B shows 1.5\n\nto 5.5% porosity, using a 3 pixel width for porosity pro-\n\nfiles.

Black corresponds to\nmafic minerals (amphibole and biotite) contents in each sample. Scale bars are 0.5 cm length.\n\n6% when associated to calcite veinlets and 5 to 8.5%\n\nwhen very fine grained chlorite is present.\n\nThe mineral-specific porosity in all samples was es-\n\ntimated on the autoradiographies using rectangular areas\n\nwith homogeneous grey-level zones in each identified\n\nmineral phase. It shows constant values between 0.2 to\n\n0.4% for quartz and alkali feldspar in all samples. Av-\n\nerage of mineral porosity in samples A and B was 1 to\n\n1.8% for amphibole, 1.7 to 2% for biotite and 12% for\n\naccessory minerals (zircon and monazite). In samples\n\nC and D mineral sites shows porosity values up to 4.5%\n\nfor calcite altering mafic minerals or feldspars, 4 to 7%\n\nfor sericite + chlorite + calcite altering mafic minerals,\n\n8% for oxide + very fine grained chlorite crystallized\n\nover feldspars, 1.5 to 5% for sericitization of feldspars,\n\n8% for destabilized ilmenite and 14% for altered micro-\n\ngranular mafic enclaves.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nNatural microcracks in granitic rocks are commonly as-\n\nsociated to (i) thermal contraction during cooling, (ii)\n\nstress relaxation during uplift or unroofing and (iii) tec-\n\ntonic deformation (Kowallis and Wang 1983). No tec-\n\ntonic deformation was visually recognized near sam-\n\npling locations during fieldwork, however infillings of\n\nsecondary veinlets can generate additional microcracks\n\nin propylitic-altered rocks.\n14C-PMMA porosity results of total rock calcula-\n\ntions were compared with data obtained by the same\n\nmethod on granitic rocks worldwide. Unaltered, fairly\n\nand strongly altered granitic rocks show commonly 0.1\n\nto 0.5%, 0.4 to 1% and 1 to 5% porosity respectively\n\n(Siitari-Kauppi et al. 1997, H\u00f6ltt\u00e4 et al. 1997, Johans-\n\nson et al. 1998). Consequently, the obtained data on\n\nunaltered (0.5% to 0.6%) and propylitic-altered (1.7%\n\nto 1.8%) granitic samples from Lavras do Sul region are\n\nin agreement with the range of porosity values for simi-\n\nlar rocks reported by other authors (Sardini et al. 2006).\n\nResults of total rock porosity between unaltered\n\nrocks (A and B) are quite similar, if we take into account\n\nthat sample B (inactive quarry) was exposed to surface\n\nalteration for a longer period of time (up to 50 years)\n\nthan sample A (borehole). However, slightly differences\n\nin the weathering and the slight propylitic alteration be-\n\ntween unaltered samples are possible. Surface exposition\n\nthrough time yields a low increase in total rock porosity\n\nas argued by other authors (Guillot et al. 2000, Thuro\n\nand Scholz 2003, I\u00f1igo et al. 2000).\n\nSome textural aspects between unaltered rocks\n\ncould enable different values for the measured porosity.\n\nPorphyritic rocks from central facies have intergranular\n\nmicrofissures (allowed by the fine grained matrix) with\n\nhigh tortuosity that is not well developed in equigranular\n\nrocks from border facies. High tortuosity and constric-\n\ntivity are commonly interpreted as longer pathways to\n\nfluid flows. The effect of trans- and intragranular mi-\n\ncrofissures with low tortuosity and low constrictivity in\n\nboth textural rocks seems to prevail over narrow and tor-\n\ntuous intergranular ones. As observed in the obtained\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\nQUANTIFICATION OF GRANITE POROSITY 14C-PMMA METHOD 513\n\nFig. 5 \u2013 In the image generated by the Autoradio software during total porosity calculation (left, A-D), small red points correspond to near null\n\nporosity pixels that are not computed. Total porosity maps (right, A\u2019-D\u2019) were obtained after total porosity calculation and conversion of the\n\nlogarithmic-scale grey level intensities of the autoradiography to linear (0-100%) grey level intensities. The darker zones (higher porosity) of the\n\nautoradiography (black = 100% porosity) correspond to inverse tonalities (white = 100% porosity) in the total porosity maps. A to D (left) and A\u2019\n\nto D\u2019 (right) correspond to the same image areas showed in figure 2. Scale bars are 0.5 cm length.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\n514 EVERTON M. BONGIOLO et al.\n\nFig. 6 \u2013 Histogram of total rock porosity (%) calculated for samples A, B, C and D.\n\nSee text for discussion.\n\ndata, those different textural characteristics seem to have\n\nno effective influence on the fluid flow through very low\n\nporosity media as unaltered granitic rocks. Moreover,\n\nslight increase of the measured total porosity of sam-\n\nple B is expected due to its higher contents of accessory\n\nminerals (zircon and monazite), which contain radioac-\n\ntive elements excited during sample irradiation. Con-\n\ncerning mafic minerals, amphibole predominates largely\n\nover biotite. These grains are in general well preserved\n\nand differences of mafic mineral contents or extension\n\nof surface areas (in clusters or as single grains) between\n\nsamples do not modify their connected (total) porosity\n\nvalue. Total porosity histogram for these rocks is com-\n\npatible with specific porosity of individual sites, which\n\nshows predominance of up to 4% porosity. The range of\n\nporosity values for mafic minerals increases linearly with\n\nopen cleavages, intragranular microfissures and chloriti-\n\nzation contents of these petrographic sites.\n\nThe main difference between samples C and D com-\n\nprises also the rock texture. Both samples were collected\n\nin the same depth (borehole) and for that reason they\n\nwere exposed to identical events of primary and sec-\n\nondary porosity formation (i.e. microcrack evolution,\n\nhydrothermal alteration and weathering). As for unal-\n\ntered rocks, the occurrence of intergranular microfis-\n\nsures did not allowed high variations in the measured\n\nporosity between samples C and D (1.7 and 1.8%). His-\n\ntograms of total porosity have higher maximal values\n\nthan for unaltered rocks, and porosity values vary up to\n\n10%. These data agree with porosity calculated for indi-\n\nvidual petrographic sites. Opened cleavages, carbonate\n\nand chlorite veinlets and diffuse alteration (chloritization,\n\nsericitization) of original minerals allow an effective in-\n\ncrease in total porosity of these samples in comparison\n\nto values obtained for unaltered rocks.\n\nFrom the bulk results we can consider the follow-\n\ning aspects:\n\n\u2022 spatial distribution of porosity values is dependent\n\non the mineralogy (either primary or secondary), as\n\nreported in previous papers (Oila et al. 2005, Sar-\n\ndini et al. 2006);\n\n\u2022 variable porosity values within a single mineral\n\ngrain is dependent on its alteration degree or imper-\n\nfect development of crystal growth;\n\n\u2022 undeformed quartz and unaltered alkali feldspar\n\nhave null to very weak porosity values and felds-\n\npar sericitization (weathered or hydrothermal) in-\n\ncreases its porosity and total porosity of rocks;\n\n\u2022 cleavage (mafic minerals), grain boundaries, com-\n\npositional zonation (rapakivi, perthite), micro-\n\ncracks, degree of alteration and accessory miner-\n\nals with radioactive elements are representative of\n\ndistinct porosity values;\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2007) 79 (3)\n\n\n\nQUANTIFICATION OF GRANITE POROSITY 14C-PMMA METHOD 515\n\n\u2022 high mafic mineral contents and clusters increase\n\nconditions to form secondary porosity if they are\n\npreviously altered or fractured.\n\nThe results obtained in this study shows that original\n\nporosity of granitic rocks with different textures (sam-\n\nples A and B) have no significant influence on the dif-\n\nferences of diffusion (width) of later phyllic alteration\n\nhalos around veins observed during field works between\n\ncentral and border facies granitoids.\n\nSecondary porosity represented by propylitic-al-\n\ntered rocks (samples C and D) has higher porosity val-\n\nues either in total or specific mineral quantifications be-\n\ntween different rock textures. Propylitic alteration com-\n\nmonly develops in response to low water/rock ratio in\n\nample areas of hydrothermal systems (Berger and Velde\n\n1992, Titley 1982) and phyllic alteration, on the con-\n\ntrary, needs high fluid/rock ratio in narrow zones of ac-\n\ntive fluid flow (fractures, veins) to develop.\n\nEarly and widespread propylitic alteration in the\n\nstudied area may have provided additional porosity for\n\nrocks due to fluid interaction (Holl et al. 1997) through\n\ncleavage plans, microcracks and secondary minerals\n\nof higher porosity prior to phyllic alteration stage near\n\nquartz veins, but the variability of diffusion width ob-\n\nserved on alteration halos between granitic facies might\n\nbe produced during phyllic alteration. If true, central\n\nand border facies were influenced by different fluid/rock\n\nratio or fluid composition during phyllic alteration stage.\n\nThat hypothesis must also consider variations in the\n\nhydrothermal products, timing between granitic facies\n\nemplacement and/or paleoenvironment of rocks (depth,\n\nsuperimposing alteration stages, tectonic deformation\n\nand location within the granitic body). Moreover, micro-\n\ngranular mafic enclaves (MME) commonly found in the\n\nborder facies are also highly porous zones that if present\n\ncan locally contribute to increase the hydrothermal fluid\n\ndiffusion.\n\nThe 14C-polymethylmethacrylate (14C-PMMA) im-\n\npregnation method, coupled with petrographic (optical\n\nand through SEM) observations and digital image pro-\n\ncessing provides a valuable methodology to identify and\n\nquantify the porosity heterogeneities in hydrothermally\n\naltered rocks and specific minerals. The modeling of\n\nfluid flows and evolution of porosity in different stages\n\nduring hydrothermal alteration is also possible. The\n\ninitial porosity (fairly altered, unaltered) and porosity\n\ngenerated during early alteration stages (propylitic) of\n\nthese granitic rocks obtained by the 14C-PMMA method\n\nshould be compared with other hydrothermal stages/\n\nenvironments (phyllic alteration, around vein selvages)\n\nwithin the same locations to test the observation of por-\n\nosity evolution until its final stages. The recognition and\n\nquantification of the connective network and of alter-\n\nation products observed in this study can be also used as\n\na data basis for calculation of mass balance of alteration.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was partly funded by Programa de Apoio\nde N\u00facleos de Excel\u00eancia (PRONEX) / Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de\nAmparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul\n(FAPERGS) \u2013 project 04/0825.3.
