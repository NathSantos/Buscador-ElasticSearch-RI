The \n\nSr isotopic variability displayed by the analysed waters is strongly \n\ncorrelated with the age and mineralogical composition of the aquifer source \n\nrocks, suggesting that the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr isotope signatures of these mineral \n\nwaters are dominantly controlled by fluid-rock and/or fluid-mineral \n\ninteraction processes. The lowest \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios are found in water samples \n\nfrom the Monchique aquifer (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.70447), located in Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline magmatic rocks of mantle origin. The Vimeiro waters \n\nhosted in carbonate and evaporite formations of Jurassic age have \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\nvalues of 0.70808 and appear to have reached bulk isotopic equilibrium \n\nwith whole-rock, whereas the waters sourced in Cenozoic siliciclastic \n\nsediments tend to exhibit \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios close to the rainwater value (S\u00e3o \n\nSilvestre; \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.71078). Finally, the waters coming from granitic \n\nand/or metamorphic terrains of the Iberian Variscan basement (Vitalis, \n\nLuso, Carvalhelhos, Fastio and Serra da Estrela) display the most \n\nradiogenic Sr isotopic signatures (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr > 0.7136).

Introduction \n\nIn the past decades, the European market of bottled mineral \n\nwaters and spring waters has been steadily growing due to the \n\nprogressive increase in the water consumption per capita (from \n\n30 L to 108 L per year over the period 1997-2004) (Euzen, 2006; \n\nBrach-Papa et al., 2009). As reported by Brach-Papa et al. (2009) \n\nand references therein, the European legislation on this subject is \n\nvery strict and contains precise specifications on several \n\nparameters such as the maximum concentrations of the major \n\nconstituents, the type of processes authorized for bottling and the \n\nlabelling information that should be provided to the consumers \n\nby the producers. From the large number of requirements of a \n\n\u2018\u2018Natural Mineral Water\u2019\u2019, the source provenance is one of the \n\nmost important. Only mineral waters with clear details of \n\nprovenance are included in the list of \u2018\u2018Natural Mineral Waters\u2019 \n\nrecognised by the European Union state members. \n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that Sr isotopes provide a \n\nway of fingerprinting different mineral waters and may therefore \n\nbe applied, in combination with other chemical and isotope data, \n\nfor source authentication purposes (e.g. N\u00e9grel et al., 1997; \n\nMontgomery et al., 2006; Voerkelius et al., 2010; Marques et al., \n\n2012). Since water is completely bio-available to plants and \n\nanimals and can be transferred to any organic material without \n\nsignificant fractionation of Sr isotopes, the determination of \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr isotope ratios has also been widely used to trace the \n\ngeographic origin of a large variety of food products (e.g. wine, \n\nmilk, butter and fruit juices) (Horn et al., 1993; 1998; Aberg, \n\n1995; Rossmann et al., 2000; Almeida and Vasconcelos, 2001; \n\nBarbaste et al., 2002; Crittenden et al., 2007; Rummel et al., \n\n2008). \n\nStrontium is a divalent cation that can easily substitute Ca\n2+\n\n \n\nin the crystal lattice of Ca-bearing minerals, such as plagioclase \n\nfeldspar, apatite, titanite, calcite, aragonite and dolomite. It has \n\nfour naturally occurring isotopes \n84\n\nSr, \n86\n\nSr, \n87\n\nSr and \n88\n\nSr. \n84\n\nSr, \n86\n\nSr and \n88\n\nSr are stable, whereas \n87\n\nSr derives from the radioactive \n\ndecay of \n87\n\nRb (Faure and Mensing 2005). As a result, the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios in rocks and minerals tend to increase with time. \n\nArtigo original \nOriginal article \n\nmailto:sararibeiro@ua.pt\n\n\n30  S. Ribeiro et al. / Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es Geol\u00f3gicas (2014) 101, 1, 29-37 \n\n \n\nUnlike strontium, rubidium is incorporated in K-bearing silicate \n\nminerals, including K-feldspars, micas and clay minerals. Of the \n\ntwo naturally occurring Rb isotopes (\n85\n\nRb and \n87\n\nRb), \n87\n\nRb is \n\nradioactive and decays to radiogenic \n87\n\nSr by ?\n-\n emission. Thus, \n\nthe age and the Rb content of a rock are the major factors \n\ncontrolling its present day \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratio. Old sialic crustal rocks \n\nwith high Rb/Sr ratios have the most radiogenic Sr isotopic \n\nsignatures (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr > 0.709). In contrast, geologically young Rb-\n\ndepleted basaltic rocks typically display the lowest \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\nratios (0.703 - 0.706), whilst Sr-enriched calcareous sediments \n\nand limestones are generally characterized by \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr values \n\nranging between 0.706 and 0.709. \n\nIt is commonly assumed that Sr isotopes are not significantly \n\naffected by mass fractionation during chemical weathering \n\nprocesses (Shand et al., 2009). Therefore, the Sr released to the \n\nwater is a function of both the composition and the stability of \n\nthe aquifer bedrock forming minerals (Faure, 1986; N\u00e9grel et al., \n\n1993; 2001). As the reaction kinetics of mineral dissolution may \n\nvary over several orders of magnitude, the Sr isotope signature \n\nrecorded in the water is dominantly controlled by the most easily \n\nweathered minerals and does not always reflect the bulk isotopic \n\ncomposition of the parent rock (e.g. Blum et al., 1993; Aberg, \n\n1995, Jacobson et al., 2002; Bau et al., 2004, Montgomery et al., \n\n2006; Shand et al., 2009). For water reservoirs interacting with \n\nsilicate lithologies, isotope equilibrium with whole-rock is rarely \n\nachieved, because the reactivity rates of their rock-forming \n\nminerals are widely variable. In contrast, the waters sourced in \n\ncarbonate environments often show close to equilibrium Sr \n\nisotope compositions due to the high solubilities of carbonate \n\nminerals. More complex distribution patterns occur when water \n\nsystems receive Sr inputs from various sources with contrasting \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios (e.g. N\u00e9grel, 1999; N\u00e9grel et al., 2001; Barbieri \n\nand Morotti, 2003). The final isotopic characteristics of these \n\nwaters will be determined by the compositions and the relative \n\ncontributions of the different end-members involved in the \n\nmixture. \n\nNatural waters have short residence times (maximum 10\n3\n \n\nyears) compared to the half-life of \n87\n\nRb\n \n(48,8x10\n\n9\n years) and \n\nsuffer no influence of the \n87\n\nRb radioactive decay. Weathering \n\nof carbonate minerals is generally very rapid, but the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\nratios in waters from non-carbonate aquifers can be strongly \n\naffected by the timescale at which water-rock interaction \n\nprocesses take place. Longer residence times tend to favour the \n\nhydrolysis reactions of silicate phases (plagioclase feldspar, \n\nfollowed by K-feldspar and micas), allowing groundwater to \n\napproach the equilibrium with the crystalline host rocks (Bullen \n\net al., 1996; Frost e Toner, 2004; Blum e Erel, 2005). \n\nAccording to Frost and Toner (2004), the permeability \n\nassociated with igneous and metamorphic rocks can also \n\ninfluence the weathering process, with low permeabilities \n\nslowing groundwater equilibration rates. \n\nIn addition to natural causes, the use of fertilizers \n\n(including dolomite, potash, nitrogen and phosphate materials) \n\nmay produce changes in the rates of release and exchange of Sr \n\nin soils and significant variations in the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios of \n\nshallow groundwaters and streams draining these regions. \n\nGroundwater contamination by agricultural activities or other \n\npollutant sources can disturb their original chemical and \n\nisotopic characteristics and add further complexities to the \n\ninvestigation of their source provenance (e.g. Bohlke e Horan, \n\n2000; Soler et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 2009). \n\nA valid interpretation of water Sr isotope signatures \n\nrequires therefore a thorough knowledge of the potential \n\nhydrogeochemical processes operating along water flow paths, \n\nbecause the Sr isotope composition of natural waters is not \n\nalways a conservative property and may be highly influenced \n\nby the following factors: (a) reaction kinetics of mineral \n\ndissolution and exchange efficiency; (b) thermodynamic \n\nequilibrium; (c) water residence time; (d) mixing of waters of \n\ndistinct provenance and (e) addition of natural or anthropogenic \n\ncontaminants. \n\nThe aim of the present investigation is to determine the Sr \n\nisotope composition of natural mineral waters from different \n\ngeologic environments in Portuguese mainland and assess the \n\nextent to which the Sr radiogenic isotopes can be used to trace \n\ntheir origin. \n\n2. Geological setting \n\nPortuguese mainland is located in the western and southwestern \n\nsector of Iberia, at latitudes between 42.2\u00b0N to 36.92\u00b0N and \n\nlongitudes between 9.61\u00b0 W to 6.07\u00b0 W (Fig. 1). In broad terms, \n\nit comprises terrains of the Variscan basement, occupying \n\nextensive areas in the inner part of the country and a Mesozoic\u2013\n\nCenozoic sedimentary cover, particularly well exposed along its \n\nwestern and southwestern margins (Fig. 1). The Variscan \n\nbasement, also known as Iberian Massif, is composed of \n\nthrusted, folded and metamorphosed rocks of Late Proterozoic \n\nand Paleozoic age and large granitoid batholiths intruded in the \n\nlast stages of the Late Paleozoic Variscan oblique continent-\n\ncontinent collision (e.g. Ribeiro et al., 1979; Matte, 1986; \n\nQuesada, 1991). \n\n \n\nFig.1. Schematic geological map of Iberia with the main structural units (adapted from \n\nVera et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nFig.1. Mapa simplificado da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica com as principais unidades estruturais \n\n(adaptado de Vera et al., 2004). \n\nDuring Mesozoic times, extensional tectonics related to the \n\nopening of the North Atlantic Ocean resulted in the development \n\nof the Lusitanian and the Algarve rift basins along the western \n\nand southwestern borders of Iberia (Ribeiro et al., 1979; Wilson \n\net al., 1989; Rasmussen et al., 1998; Terrinha, 1998). The \n\nstratigraphic record preserved in these fault-bounded basins \n\nincludes Late Triassic red fluvial siliciclastics, Hettangian \n\nevaporites and Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous limestones, \n\nsandstones and shales, documenting the occurrence of several \n\nrifting episodes from early Triassic to early Cretaceous (Wilson \n\net al., 1989; Pinheiro et al., 1996). \n\nContinental breakup was accompanied by three cycles of \n\nmagmatic activity. The first cycle is represented on-shore by \n\nbasaltic and dolerite dykes of tholeiitic affinities intruded at \n\naround 200 Ma. This episode was followed by the emplacement \n\nof Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous intrusives with transitional \n\ncharacteristics, at approximately 140 Ma (Ferreira e Macedo, \n\n1979; Martins, 1991; Martins et al., 2008; Verati et al., 2007). \n\n\n\nSr isotopic signatures of Portuguese bottled mineral waters 31 \n\n \n\nThe last magmatic cycle took place between 100 and 70 Ma and \n\nincludes the NNW-SSE aligned subvolcanic alkaline complexes \n\nof Sintra, Sines and Monchique, the volcanic complex of \n\nLisbon and other minor alkaline intrusions (Miranda et al., \n\n2009). \n\nFinally, the Cenozoic evolution of Iberia was strongly \n\ncontrolled by Alpine compression, involving distinct periods of \n\ncrustal deformation, fault reactivation, and halokinesis related to \n\nmultiple episodes of collision between Iberia, Eurasia and Africa \n\n(e.g. Mougenot, 1986; Malod and Mau\u00a1ret, 1990; Srivastava et \n\nal., 1990; Rosembaum et al., 2002; Alves et al., 2003). These \n\ntectonic events are well expressed by a series of unconformity-\n\nbounded Cenozoic sequences. Basin infilling resulted from the \n\ninterplay between alluvial fan, lacustrine, fluvial and shallow \n\nmarine sedimentation and consists of major siliciclastic facies \n\nassemblages associated with minor carbonates (Antunes et al., \n\n1999, Pais et al., 2010). \n\n3. Sampling and analytical techniques \n\nThe samples analysed in this study were collected from 250 -\n\n1500 mL water bottles from different brands, purchased in \n\ngrocery stores. Only mineral waters with clear details for \n\nprovenance, mineral content values and physical parameters \n\nwere selected for analysis. Their geographical origin was \n\ndetermined through the address labelled on the bottle and \n\nfurther confirmed by direct contact with the technical director \n\nof each mineral water company. Many of the waters now \n\nexploited on a commercial basis have a long documented \n\nhistory of use and are believed to be endowed with healing \n\nproperties. Of the nine samples analysed, eight are classified as \n\n\u2018\u2018Natural Mineral Waters\u2019\u2019 and one as \u201cSpring Water\u201d. In order \n\nto assess the effects from mixing of water from several \n\nboreholes, filtering and bottling processes and potential \n\nseasonal variations of strontium isotope ratios, the \n\ncharacterization of each type of water involved the \n\nmeasurement of two / three replicate samples with different \n\nbottling dates and serial numbers. For comparison purposes, \n\nsamples of rainwater and snow were also collected and \n\nanalysed. To minimize contamination, snow samples were \n\ncollected approximately 0.1 - 0.2 m below the snow surface and \n\nstored into pre-cleaned containers. \n\nSample preparation involved previous filtering of rainwater \n\nand snow samples through a pre-washed 0.5 ?m Millipore \n\nfilter. All water samples were then acidified to pH 2 with \n\nredistilled concentrated HNO3. A volume of 250 mL for \n\nrainwater and snow samples and 10 - 50 mL for bottled waters \n\nwas measured into pre-cleaned Teflon beakers and evaporated \n\nto dryness. The residue was subsequently acidified with 1mL \n\nsub-boiled HF and 0.5 mL sub-boiled HNO3 and dried. Each \n\nsample was then dissolved using 1 mL of sub-boiled 6.2N HCl \n\nand evaporated to dryness. Strontium was collected using \n\nconventional AG8 50W Bio-Rad resin ion exchange methods \n\nand loaded on single tantalum filaments with H3PO4. \n\nThe Sr isotope compositions were determined using a VG \n\nSector 54 multi-collector mass spectrometer in the Laboratory \n\nof Isotope Geology of the University of Aveiro. All \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\nratios were corrected for instrumental mass fractionation and \n\nnormalized to \n86\n\nSr/\n88\n\nSr = 0.1194. The in-run precision of each \n\nanalysis lies between 30 to 50 ppm, with two standard \n\ndeviations from the mean (2? error) and Sr blanks are less than \n\n250 pg. The international standard SRM-987 gave an average \n\nvalue of 0.710249 ? 6 (n = 18) during this study. \n\nSr concentrations in the water samples were obtained by \n\ninductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro. \n\n4. Results and discussion \n\nThe location of the studied samples is shown in the simplified \n\ngeological map of Portugal of figure 2. Chemical and Sr isotopic \n\ndata for rainwater and snow samples are given in table 1. General \n\ninformation for the analysed bottled mineral waters, including \n\nsource, water type, mineral content values and pH are presented \n\nin table 2, whilst their Sr contents and \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr isotopic ratios are \n\ncompiled in table 3. Thorough reviews on the main chemical \n\ncharacteristics of Portuguese bottled mineral waters can be found \n\nin Louren\u00e7o et al. (2010). \n\n \n\nFig.2.

Despite the small \n\nnumber of samples collected and their scattered spatial and \n\ntemporal distribution (2005, 2006, 2009 and 2010), the data \n\nobtained in this study lie within the range of values published in \n\nthe literature for rainwater in Portugal and other European \n\ncountries, such as Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland and \n\nScotland (Fig. 3). The average value (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.70951 ? \n\n0.00033) provides therefore a rough estimate for the isotopic \n\ncomposition of rain in Portugal. \n\n\n\n32  S. Ribeiro et al. / Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es Geol\u00f3gicas (2014) 101, 1, 29-37 \n\n \n\nAs pointed out by N\u00e9grel et al. (2007), the Sr isotopic signature \n\nof rainwater is dominantly controlled by the nature of the \n\natmospheric aerosol sources, including sea salts, crustal dust, \n\nvolcanic dust, biogenic material and anthropogenic emissions. In \n\nthe present case, most of the rainwater and snow samples have \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios similar or slightly higher than that of seawater \n\n(\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.70918 \u00b1 1, Faure and Mensing, 2005) revealing that \n\nsea salts are probably the major source of dissolved species for \n\nrain and snow falls in Portugal. A significant contribution of \n\ncontinental dusts from silicate terrains of the Variscan basement \n\n(e.g. granite, gneiss, metasediments) and/or Cenozoic cover \n\ndeposits is strongly suggested for the rain and snow samples with \n\nmore radiogenic compositions (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr > 0.709). \n\nTable 1.

The lack of significant \n\ndifferences in the isotopic compositions of replicate samples \n\nfrom the same brand, pumped and bottled at distinct dates, \n\ndemonstrates that the potential influence of mixing between \n\nwaters from different boreholes, filtering and bottling processes \n\nand/or seasonal variations of strontium isotope ratios can be \n\nneglected. \n\nFigure 4 shows that the nine samples of Portuguese mineral \n\nwaters are clearly distinguished on the basis of their \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\nsignatures. The Monchique water drawn from Late Cretaceous \n\nalkaline magmatic aquifer rocks is the least radiogenic (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\n= 0.70447) of the analysed mineral waters. The water samples \n\nhosted in Jurassic limestones (\u201cVimeiro\u201d) and Miocene \n\nsandstones (\u201cS\u00e3o Silvestre\u201d) have average \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr isotopic \n\nratios of 0.708086 and 0.71077, respectively, which, in the latter \n\ncase, are very close to rainwater values. Finally, all the remaining \n\nbottled mineral waters come from areas of the Variscan basement \n\nand yield very radiogenic isotopic compositions (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr > \n\n0.713). As discussed below, the stratigraphic age of the aquifer \n\nhost rocks and their mineralogical composition appear to be the \n\nmain factors governing the water Sr isotope signatures. \n\nTable 2.

The \n\naquifer (82 - 176 m depth) is located in continental siliciclastic \n\nunits of Miocene age (Burdigalian - Helvetian), known as the \n\ndetrital complexes of \u201cOta\u201d and \u201cArneiro de Milhari\u00e7as\u201d, which \n\nare overlain by marls and carbonate sediments from the \n\nSarmatian - Pontian complex. The three sedimentary complexes \n\nare part of the infilling deposits of a large basin differentiated at \n\nmiddle Eocene times, as a result of the reactivation of NE-SW \n\nfractures - the Lower Tejo Cenozoic basin (Figs. 1 and 2). \n\n\n\nSr isotopic signatures of Portuguese bottled mineral waters 33 \n\n \n\nIn terms of Sr isotopic composition, there are strong \n\nsimilarities between the S\u00e3o Silvestre water (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.710754 \n\n- 0.710785) and rainwater (Fig. 4). This suggests that the Sr \n\nisotopic signature of this water was probably controlled by direct \n\nrainfall recharge of the aquifer and has not suffered significant \n\ninfluence of water-rock interaction processes. According to \n\nAlbino de Medeiros (oral communication), technical director of \n\nthis water, the admitted short residence time and high velocity \n\nflow of water on S\u00e3o Silvestre aquifer may therefore have \n\nprevented groundwater from equilibrating with the host rocks. \n\nThe nature of the bedrock (sandstones) can also have contributed \n\nto inhibit extensive interaction between groundwater and the \n\nsurrounding reservoir rocks, because the main mineral \n\nconstituents in these deposits (quartz \u00b1 K-feldspar + micas \u00b1 clay \n\nminerals; Manuppella et al., 2006) are not easily dissolved \n\n(Bullen et al., 1996; Frost and Toner, 2004; Blum and Erel, \n\n2005). \n\n \nFig.4.

The shaded area represents the range of rainwater in \n\nPortugal from 0.7084 to 0.7114 (data from this study and presented by Andrade, \n\n2002). \n\n \n\nFig.4.

A \u00e1rea sombreada indica o intervalo de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\n\u00e1gua da chuva em Portugal, de 0,7084 a 0,7114 (dados deste estudo e de Andrade, \n\n2002). \n\nHowever, the relatively high mineralization content and pH \n\nvalue recorded in the S\u00e3o Silvestre waters (181 mg/L, pH = \n\n7.13; Tab. 2) and, particularly their elevated Sr concentrations \n\n(Sr = 64 ppb, Tab. 2), point to some ion input from the marls \n\nand carbonate sediments from the overlying Sarmatian - \n\nPontian formations along their flow path. As, on the other hand, \n\nthe clastic component of the Cenozoic sediments is mostly \n\nderived from weathering of strongly radiogenic Precambrian \n\nand Palaeozoic rocks and would therefore have produced \n\nwaters with relatively high \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr isotopic ratios, an \n\nalternative scenario can be proposed. In this model, the isotopic \n\nsignature of the S\u00e3o Silvestre water could have resulted from \n\nmixing of distinct Sr sources (meteoric water, carbonates with \n\nlow \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr isotopic ratios and sandstones with high \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\nisotopic ratios). \n\nIrrespective of the model assumed, the available data \n\nsuggest that the S\u00e3o Silvestre mineral aquifer corresponds to a \n\nsemi-confined aquifer in which water flows on the Miocene \n\ndetrital formation but also receives water, by leakage, from the \n\noverlying carbonates. \n\nLate Cretaceous alkaline magmatic rocks \u2013 \u201cMonchique\u201d water \n\nThe Late Cretaceous Monchique alkaline subvolcanic complex \n\ncrops out in the southwest corner of Portugal (Fig. 2) and consists \n\nof two concentric bodies of nepheline syenites and minor \n\noccurrences of mafic and ultramafic rocks (Rock, 1978; Miranda \n\net al., 2009). These alkaline magmas of deep mantle origin were \n\nintruded into Carboniferous slates and quartzites from the \n\nBrejeira Formation, at around 72 Ma (MacIntyre and Berger, \n\n1982, Rock, 1976; Bernard Griffiths et al., 1997; Valadares, \n\n2004). \n\nThe Monchique water flows through a highly fractured \n\nbedrock, taps a deep aquifer (at least several hundred meters \n\ndeep) and is recovered from drill holes at temperatures of 27? - \n\n31.5 \u00baC (Louren\u00e7o and Cruz, 2010; Tab. 2). Its Na-HCO3 \n\nchemical character and high pH values (total mineral contents = \n\n295 mg/L, pH = 9.13; Tab. 2) indicate that groundwater has \n\nsignificantly interacted with the main mineral phases (K-feldspar \n\n+ albite + nepheline) present in the nepheline syenite host rocks. \n\nProgressive dissolution of Na-silicates (albite and nepheline) was \n\nprobably the major cause for the increase of sodium \n\nconcentration and alkalinity in the Monchique water. However, it \n\nis likely that ion exchange reactions between groundwater and \n\nNa-rich clays produced by weathering of primary minerals along \n\nfracture zones has also contributed to the chemical signature of \n\nthe Monchique water (Venturelli et al., 2003). Also relevant for \n\nthe geochemical composition of the Monchique water is the \n\ncontribution of other deep-origin components (CO2, H2S, NaCl \n\nand N2) (Calado and Vieira da Silva, 2003). \n\nFrom the group of samples of bottled mineral waters analysed \n\nin this study, the Monchique water is the least radiogenic \n\n(\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.704448 - 0.704486; Fig. 4). The \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr isotopic \n\nratios for this sample lie within the range of present-day whole-\n\nrock values displayed by the nepheline syenites (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = \n\n0.703674 \u00b1 52 - 0,705189 \u00b1 56, Valadares, 2004), revealing that \n\ngroundwater appears to have reached almost complete \n\nequilibrium with the aquifer host rocks. Both the bulk chemistry \n\nand the Sr isotopic composition of the Monchique water may \n\ntherefore result from long-term fluid-rock interaction \n\nmechanisms, at relatively high temperature. \n\nMesozoic Limestones \u2013 \u201cVimeiro\u201d water \n\nThe Vimeiro mineral water comes from a deep-seated confined \n\naquifer (? 200 m) of Late Jurassic karstified limestones (Upper \n\nKimmeridgian), located in the southern sector of the Lusitanian \n\nBasin (Fig. 1). At the presently exposed level, the limestones \n\noccur at the flanks of a NNE-SSW salt anticline structure \n\n(Maceira diapir) with a core composed of Late Triassic \n\nmudstones, carbonates and evaporites from the \u201cDagorda \n\nFormation\u201d (Hettangian) (Manuppella et al., 1999). The region is \n\nfamous for its thermal bath resort and highly mineralized springs. \n\nThe water is heated by circulation down to 1000 m in depth \n\nreaching temperatures of 35 \u00baC and discharges in a valley situated \n\non the eastern flank of the diapir zone, with temperatures up to \n\n26\u00b0C (Costa, 1982). \n\nThe chemical composition (Na-Ca-Cl-HCO3) and high total \n\ndissolved solids content (1112 mg/L) of the Vimeiro bottled \n\nmineral water (Tab. 2) can be attributed to intense dissolution of \n\ncarbonates (calcite/dolomite), sulphates (anhydrite/gypsum) and \n\nchloride salts (halite) from the buried Mesozoic carbonate and \n\nevaporite formations during deep groundwater flow and mostly \n\nduring ascending terminal fluxes. Widespread water\u2013rock \n\ninteraction processes involving highly soluble minerals with \n\ntypically low Rb/Sr values would have enabled groundwater to \n\nequilibrate chemically and isotopically with the aquifer host \n\n\n\n34  S. Ribeiro et al. / Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es Geol\u00f3gicas (2014) 101, 1, 29-37 \n\n \n\nrocks, explaining the low \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios found in the sample of \n\nthe Vimeiro water (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.708084 - 0.708087, Fig. 4). \n\nAssuming that the Sr isotopic composition of the Vimeiro \n\ngroundwater is inherited from the evaporite/marine carbonate \n\nrock system with which it interacts, its isotope ratio should \n\nencompass the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr seawater curve for Late Triassic and/or \n\nLate Jurassic times. However, the average Sr isotopic ratio \n\nobtained in the sample of the Vimeiro natural mineral water is \n\nslightly higher than the values reported in the literature for \n\nHettangian and Upper Kimmeridgian seawater (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = \n\n0.7077 and 0.7069 respectively; Jones and Jenkyns, 2001). As \n\nsuch, it is possible that the observed increase reflects changes in \n\nthe Sr isotopic signatures of the reservoir rocks induced by post-\n\ndepositional diagenetic processes or derive from mixing with \n\nmore radiogenic non-marine waters. Irrespective of the factors \n\ncontrolling this subtle shift towards more elevated \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\nratios, the Sr isotopic composition of the Vimeiro groundwater is \n\nentirely consistent with the published data for aquifers associated \n\nwith Mesozoic marine carbonates (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.7070 - 0.7090; \n\nVoerkelius et al., 2010). \n\nVariscan granitoids \u2013 \u201cCarvalhelhos\u201d, \u201cFastio\u201d, \u201cSerra da \n\nEstrela\u201d mineral waters \n\nThe water samples included in this group are all hosted in \n\ngranitoid intrusions from Northern/Central Portugal (Fig. 2). \n\nMost of these plutons were emplaced into metasediments of Late \n\nProterozoic to Paleozoic age, during or slightly after the last \n\nVariscan deformation event (D3). Based on their structural, \n\npetrographical and geochemical characteristics, the Portuguese \n\nVariscan granitoids have been classified into four main suites: a) \n\nearly, syn-D3 granodiorites and biotite monzogranites; b) strongly \n\nperaluminous syn-D3 leucogranites and two-mica granites; c) \n\nlate-post-D3 calc-alkaline granodiorites and biotite monzogranites \n\nand (d) late-post-D3, slightly peraluminous, biotite-muscovite \n\ngranites (Azevedo and Valle Aguado, 2013 and references \n\ntherein). It is generally accepted that the synkinematic \n\nleucogranites and two-mica granites have S-type signatures \n\n(\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSri > 0.708) and should therefore have derived from \n\npartial melting of middle crustal metasedimentary sources \n\n(Azevedo and Valle Aguado, 2013 and references therein). In \n\ncontrast, a major contribution from metaigneous lower crust \n\nmaterials and/or interaction with mantle derived magmas appears \n\nto be required to produce the least radiogenic I- and H-type syn-\n\nD3 and late-post-D3 granodiorite-monzogranite suites (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSri &lt;\n\n0.708) (Azevedo and Valle Aguado, 2013 and references \n\ntherein). \n\nThe Carvalhelhos water has very peculiar characteristics. It \n\ncomes from a large hydrologic province of hot and cold CO2-rich \n\nthermal and mineral springs, located in the Galicia-Tr\u00e1s-os-\n\nMontes para-autochthonous terrains of NE Portugal. Many of \n\nthese CO2-rich waters are issued from granitic aquifers, at the \n\nintersection of major fault systems, reactivated during Alpine \n\ncompression (e.g. Marques et al., 2006; Marques et al., 2010; \n\nLouren\u00e7o, 2010). According to several authors, their high CO2 \n\ncontents result from fluids of deep-seated (upper-mantle) origin, \n\ncarrying a CO2-rich gaseous phase, that have migrated towards \n\nthe surface through the regional fault network (e.g. Marques et \n\nal., 2006; Carreira et al., 2008; Marques et al., 2010). \n\nIn the Carvalhelhos area, the spring emergences occur close \n\nto the contact between the Barroso syn-D3 two-mica granite and \n\nthe Silurian metasedimentary sequences, with a temperature of \n\n22\u00b0C, a total mineralization of 230 mg/L and a pH of 7.3. The \n\nrelatively low outflow temperatures suggest that these Na-HCO3-\n\nCO2 cold waters represent infiltrating meteoric waters with deep \n\ncirculation paths (at least 200 m deep), mineralized by water\u2013\n\ngas\u2013rock interaction processes. According to Vieira da Silva (oral \n\ncommunication), technical director of this water, the absence of \n\ntritium in samples of the Carvalhelhos water collected in 1996, \n\nmeans that infiltration of meteoric water occurred more than 44 \n\nyears before that date. Carbon isotopes analysis were \n\ninconclusive concerning dating of this water, since it is suspected \n\nthat there is a deep mantle CO2 contribution to its final \n\ncomposition. \n\nThe Sr isotopic ratios for the Carvalhelhos water (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = \n\n0.726255 - 0.726485), though more radiogenic than rainwater \n\n(Fig. 4), do not lie within the range of present-day values \n\nreported by Saraiva et al. (2007) for samples of the host granite \n\n(\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.749238) and the Silurian formations (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = \n\n0.760103 - 0.782684) (Tab. 3), indicating that the bulk \n\nequilibrium between rocks and fluids was not attained. In granitic \n\nand metamorphic environments, the isotopic exchange between \n\nrocks and fluids is highly dependent on the relative leaching \n\nstabilities of the different silicate phases (plagioclase feldspar \n\ndissolves first than biotite, K-feldspar or muscovite), which may \n\ntherefore lead to some decoupling of their Sr isotopic \n\ncompositions (Stettler and All\u00e9gre, 1978; Lasaga, 1984, Marques \n\net al., 2006). As, on the other hand, the most easily weathered \n\nsilicate mineral is plagioclase feldspar, which is Sr-enriched and \n\nfar less radiogenic than K-feldspar or micas (Tab. 3), it is likely \n\nthat the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios of the Carvalhelhos mineral waters have \n\nbeen essentially controlled by the dissolution of Na-feldspar, as \n\nproposed by Saraiva (2006) and Saraiva et al. (2007). The high \n\ndegree of overlap between the Sr isotopic ratios of the \n\nCarvalhelhos water and the results obtained by Brough (1990) in \n\nplagioclases from similar granitoids (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.716873 - \n\n0.736393) supports this assumption.  \n\nThe samples of the Fastio and Serra da Estrela bottled \n\nmineral waters can be clearly distinguished from the \n\nCarvalhelhos water by their lower concentrations of dissolved \n\nsolids (&lt;52 mg/L), pH values (5.8 - 6.9) and average Sr isotopic \n\nratios (Fastio: 0.71369, Serra da Estrela: 0.71982). Their \n\nphysico-chemical characteristics and Sr isotopic compositions \n\npoint to shallower groundwater circulation paths, shorter \n\nresidence times and less effective fluid-rock (fluid-plagioclase) \n\ninteraction mechanisms. It should be noted, however, that the \n\naquifer source rocks are in both cases late-post-D3 Variscan \n\ngranitoids with younger ages, lower Rb/Sr ratios and less \n\nradiogenic Sr isotopic signatures than the S-type granite hosting \n\nthe Carvalhelhos water. \n\nThe Gouveia Massif (Serra da Estrela water) displays a U-Pb \n\nzircon age of 301 ? 2.6 Ma and a Sr isotopic ratio of 0.74421 \n\n(Neiva et al., 2009), whereas the Agrela Massif (Fastio water) is \n\n306 ? 3.5 Ma old and shows present-day \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios ranging \n\nfrom 0.720803 to 0.732505 (Dias et al., 1998; 2002). A \n\ncomparison of water and whole-rock isotope ratios is of little \n\nrelevance, because full isotope equilibrium with the surrounding \n\ncountry rocks is rarely achieved (N\u00e9grel et al., 2001; Shand et al., \n\n2009). Nevertheless, differences in the age and nature of granite \n\nreservoirs will have strong effects on the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios of their \n\nsilicate minerals, being therefore possible that the Sr isotopic \n\nvariability recorded in the three types of granite waters analysed \n\nin this study reflects contrasts in the exchange rates and \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\ncompositions of the plagioclase with which they have interacted, \n\nas also demonstrated by Marques et al. (2012). \n\nOrdovician quartzites \u2013 \u201cLuso\u201d, \u201cLadeira de Envendos\u201d, \n\n\u201cCastelo de Vide\u201d mineral waters. \n\nThe natural mineral waters of Luso, Ladeira de Envendos and \n\nCastelo de Vide are low mineralised water types (Tab. 2), derived \n\nfrom infiltration of meteoric water along a highly fractured \n\n\n\nSr isotopic signatures of Portuguese bottled mineral waters 35 \n\n \n\nbedrock, consisting mainly of quartzites of Lower Ordovician age \n\n(Arenigian). The Ordovician sequences are exposed in the core of \n\na series of NW-SE trending synclines, formed during the first \n\nVariscan deformation event (Bu\u00e7aco, Envendos-Pinhal and \n\nCastelo de Vide synclines, respectively). \n\nIn a geological environment dominated by quartz-rich \n\nlithologies with little or no Sr-bearing minerals, a close match \n\nbetween the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios of groundwater and rainfall should be \n\nexpected. However, the average Sr isotopic compositions of the \n\nthree mineral water samples (Luso:\n \n\n0.71525; Ladeira de \n\nEnvendos: 0.71700; Castelo de Vide: 0.77701) are distinctly \n\nmore radiogenic than rainwater (Fig. 4), suggesting that the \n\nisotopic composition of the recharge waters was substantially \n\nmodified by the input of easily accessible Sr with high \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\nratios from external sources.  \n\nFor the Luso and Ladeira de Envendos hydrologic systems, \n\nthe increase in the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios relative to rainwater may have \n\nresulted from chemical weathering of silicate minerals present \n\neither in arkosic / pelitic intercalations within the Arenigian \n\nquartzite succession or in the underlying red bed and \n\nconglomerate deposits of presumed Tremadocian age (Teixeira, \n\n1981; Oliveira et al., 1992). These low-grade metasedimentary \n\nrocks contain, in addition to quartz, variable amounts of feldspar \n\nand phylossilicates (muscovite and chlorite) and may thus have \n\nsupplied radiogenic Sr to groundwater. \n\nThe Luso and Ladeira de Envendos mineral waters flow \n\nthrough deep-seated fractures (> 100 m) and discharge with \n\nmoderate temperatures (Luso: 27 \u00baC; Envendos: 22 \u00baC), pH \n\nranging from 4.8 to 5.7 and very low mineralization contents \n\n(Tab. 2). Under these conditions, partial equilibrium between \n\nsilicic rocks and fluids could have occurred and Sr may have \n\nbeen progressively released to the solution from the primary \n\nreacting minerals (feldspar, muscovite, chlorite) and neo-formed \n\nclay minerals, promoting the elevation of the \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios in \n\nthe waters. Their overall chemistry and relatively high silica \n\nconcentrations are consistent with a chemical evolution primarily \n\ncontrolled by water-rock interaction processes involving acidic \n\nweathering of aluminosilicates. In the case of the Serra do \n\nBu\u00e7aco aquifers (Luso region), Vieira da Silva et al. (2000) \n\nshowed that there is a direct correlation between discharge \n\ntemperature, silica content, maximum depth of circulation and \n\ntritium content (residence time). \n\nAs first pointed out by Voerkelius et al. (2010), the Castelo \n\nde Vide mineral water exhibits anomalously high \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios \n\n(0.776543 - 0.777268). The water is sourced from an Ordovician \n\naquifer system (the \u201cCastelo de Vide\u201d syncline) showing the \n\nsame broad stratigraphic units that the Luso and Ladeira de \n\nEnvendos synclines. However, the Ordovician sequences of the \n\nCastelo de Vide syncline are in contact with strongly deformed \n\npre-Variscan granitoids (Portalegre orthogneisses), related to an \n\nold episode of magmatic activity (493 \u00b1 3.5 Ma; Sol\u00e1, 2007). In \n\nkeeping with their old age and extreme differentiated character, \n\nthe Portalegre orthogneisses have \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr ratios ranging from \n\n0.9573 - 1.4985 (Sol\u00e1, 2007). Because the Sr isotope ratios in \n\ngranite rock forming minerals depend on the age and Rb/Sr ratio \n\nof the host, it may be presumed that dissolution of radiogenic \n\nplagioclase (and to a lesser extent, K-felspar and biotite) from the \n\nPortalegre orthogneisses could have provided a supplementary \n\nsource of radiogenic Sr for the Castelo de Vide mineral water. \n\n5. Conclusions \n\nBased on the results obtained for nine samples of bottled mineral \n\nwaters from Portuguese mainland, it is possible do draw the \n\nfollowing conclusions: \n\n(a) each of the analysed water samples exhibits a distinctive \n\nSr isotope signature that does not change significantly with time \n\nand can therefore be used for purposes of mineral water \n\nauthentication; \n\n(b) the Sr isotope ratios of the analysed waters are \n\ndominantly controlled by both the nature and stratigraphic age of \n\nthe aquifer host rocks. The least radiogenic waters are related to \n\nJurassic carbonates / evaporites (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.70808) and Late \n\nCretaceous alkaline igneous sources (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr = 0.70447), \n\nwhereas the Cenozoic siliciclastic sediments host waters with \n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr values of 0.71078 and the waters coming from granitic \n\nand/or metamorphic terrains of the Iberian Variscan basement \n\ndisplay highly radiogenic Sr isotopic compositions (\n87\n\nSr/\n86\n\nSr \n\nvarying between 0.7136 and 0.7770); \n\n(c) fluid-rock and fluid-mineral interaction processes \n\ninvolving lithologies composed by easily soluble minerals \n\n(calcite/dolomite, anhydrite/gypsum and halite) promote bulk \n\nisotope equilibrium between groundwater and parent rock \n\n(Vimeiro water). For water reservoirs interacting with silicate \n\nrocks, isotopic equilibrium with the whole-rock is rarely achieved \n\ndue to the variable reactivity rates of their mineral constituents \n\n(Carvalhelhos, Fastio, Serra da Estrela, Castelo de Vide, Luso, \n\nLadeira de Envendos waters) and can only be approached by \n\nlong-term fluid-rock interaction mechanisms at high temperatures \n\n(Monchique water); \n\n(d) in non-carbonate environments, the input of radiogenic Sr \n\nto the water is a function of the stability, age and Rb/Sr ratios of \n\nthe aquifer bedrock silicate minerals and appears to be mainly \n\nprovided by the hydrolysis of plagioclase feldspar and, to a lesser \n\nextent, primary phylossilicates or neo-formed clay minerals. \n\nFinally, the presence of significant differences in the Sr \n\nisotope composition of the Portuguese bottled mineral waters \n\nprovides a powerful tool for fingerprinting their origin and to \n\ntrace the hydrogeochemical processes operating along water flow \n\npaths. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe authors wish to thank Eugenio Soares, Joana Coimbra and \n\nLina Carvalho, from the ICP Laboratory (Laborat\u00f3rio Central de \n\nAn\u00e1lises - University of Aveiro) for the Sr concentration data. \n\nWe are also grateful to Vieira da Silva, Antunes da Silva, Albino \n\nde Medeiros and Manuela Azevedo, who gave us detailed and \n\nactual data concerning the exploitation of each mineral water \n\ninvolved in this study.
