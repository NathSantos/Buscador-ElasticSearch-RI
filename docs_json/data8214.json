Este comportamento \n\nsugere que a destila\u00e7\u00e3o a elevadas temperaturas representa uma boa estrat\u00e9gia para \n\nseparar os componentes de misturas bin\u00e1rias, tais como sistemas de \u00e1gua-\u00e1lcool, \n\nmuito relevantes na ind\u00fastria qu\u00edmica. \n\nOs combust\u00edveis biodegrad\u00e1veis come\u00e7am a desempenhar um papel importante na \n\neconomia global do mundo, com os pre\u00e7os do petr\u00f3leo a aumentar de forma \n\nconstante, pelo que a busca de energias e de combust\u00edveis alternativos \u00e9 vital para a \n\nsustentabilidade da economia mundial. A produ\u00e7\u00e3o de combust\u00edveis biodegrad\u00e1veis \n\ncomo os \u00e1lcoois requer propriedades de misturas bin\u00e1rias envolvendo \u00e1lcoois tais \n\ncomo metanol, etanol, propanol, butanol e pentanol (cadeia linear ou ramificada), \n\ntanto a partir da experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, como da previs\u00e3o e da correla\u00e7\u00e3o. A obten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ndados de equil\u00edbrio l\u00edquido vapour (ELV) a temperaturas elevadas tornou-se um dos \n\nmeios mais importantes para o dimensionamento de unidades de destila\u00e7\u00e3o de alta \n\npress\u00e3o. \n\nFoi com essa vis\u00e3o que um programa experimental de equil\u00edbrio l\u00edquido-vapour \n\n(VLE) a elevadas temperaturas foi desenvolvido em colabora\u00e7\u00e3o entre o Centro de \n\nCi\u00eancias Moleculares e Materiais (CCMM - FCUL) e o Laborat\u00f3rio de Termodin\u00e2mica \n\nExperimental (CQE - IST). As medi\u00e7\u00f5es de ELV no intervalo de temperaturas 363.3K \n\n423.7K foram realizadas para os sistemas \u00e1gua+etanol, \u00e1gua+1-propanol e \n\netanol+1-propanol utilizando um aparelho de fluxo. \n\nAs medi\u00e7\u00f5es de ELV a elevadas temperaturas mostram algumas dificuldades \n\nexperimentais, devido \u00e0 poss\u00edvel degrada\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica de alguns \u00e1lcoois, tais como o \n\nmetanol. Com a finalidade de minimizar este fen\u00f3meno, foi escolhido um m\u00e9todo de \n\nfluxo. \n\nA interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o te\u00f3rica destes dados de ELV tem sido feita no passado recorrendo a \n\nequa\u00e7\u00f5es de estado. O sucesso destas interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 limitado pelo tipo de \n\n\n\n \n\nii \n\ncompostos e tamb\u00e9m pelas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de trabalho. De entre v\u00e1rias equa\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nestado, novos m\u00e9todos que tomam em conta os efeitos de associa\u00e7\u00e3o molecular t\u00eam \n\nsido propostos ao longo dos anos. A equa\u00e7\u00e3o de estado Statistical Associating Fluid \n\nTheory (SAFT) desenvolvido por Gubbins e colegas \u00e9 uma delas. \n\nNeste trabalho uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o dessa equa\u00e7\u00e3o (Statistical Associating Fluid Theory for \n\npotentials of Variable Range - SAFT-VR) foi utilizada para prever o ELV das misturas \n\nbin\u00e1rias em quest\u00e3o. Esta teoria previu eficazmente o comportamento destas \n\nmisturas bin\u00e1rias com algumas limita\u00e7\u00f5es para alguns componentes puros. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\niii \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nIt is known that the presence of strong hydrogen bonds in the liquid state creates \n\nazeotropes, which disappear with the increase of temperature. This behavior \n\nsuggests that the distillation at high temperatures could provide a good strategy to \n\nseparate components of binary mixtures such as alcohol-water systems, very \n\nrelevant in the chemical industry.  \n\nBiodegradable fuels start to play an important role in the world global economy, as \n\noil prices are increasing steadily and the search for alternative energies and fuels is \n\nvital for the sustainability of world economy. The production of biodegradable fuels \n\nas alcohols, needs properties of binary mixtures involving methanol, ethanol, \n\npropanol, butanol and pentanol (linear and branched), both from experiment, \n\nprediction and correlation. High temperature vapour liquid equilibrium (VLE) \n\nmeasurements became one of the key data for the design of high pressure \n\ndistillation units. Also, alcohols have a wide use in industry as solvents for fats, oils, \n\nresins, paints, and nitrocellulose; others find use in the manufacture of perfumes \n\nand brake fluids. Mixtures of ethanol with 1-propanol, 1-butanol, or 1-pentanol can \n\nbe used as fuel oxygenates, as cryogenic fluids and as heat reservoir in cryogenic \n\npower generation systems. That\u2019s why the knowledge of thermodynamic properties \n\nfor these mixtures at various temperatures is important.  \n\nIt was with this vision that a VLE experimental program at high temperatures was \n\ndeveloped in a collaboration between the Centre for Molecular Sciences and \n\nMaterials (CCMM-FCUL) and the Experimental Thermodynamics Laboratory (CQE-\n\nIST). The VLE measurements over the temperature range 363.3 K to 423.7 K have \n\nbeen performed for the systems water+ethanol, water+1-propanol and ethanol+1-\n\npropanol using a flow apparatus.  \n\nThe VLE measurements at high temperature show some experimental difficulties \n\ndue to the possible thermal degradation of some alcohols, like methanol. With the \n\npurpose of minimizing this phenomenon, these studies must be carried out using a \n\nflow apparatus. This was the main reason for the choice of a flow method over a few \n\ntypes available.  \n\n\n\n \n\niv \n\nThe theoretical interpretation of these VLE data has been done in the past by using \n\nequations of state. The success of these interpretations is limited by the type of \n\ncompounds and also by the working conditions. From the various possibilities, new \n\nmethods designed to take into account the effects of molecular association have \n\nbeen proposed over the years. The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) \n\nequation of state developed by Gubbins and coworkers is one of them.  \n\nIn this work a variation of this equation (Statistical Associating Fluid Theory for \n\npotentials of Variable Range - SAFT-VR) was used to predict the VLE of the binary \n\nmixtures in question. This theory was found to accurate predict the behavior of \n\nthese binary mixtures with some limitations for some pure components.  \n\n\n\n \n\nv \n\nTable of Contents \n\nPage \nResumo ................................................................................................................................................................................. i \n\nAbstract ............................................................................................................................................................................. iii \n\nNotation .............................................................................................................................................................................. x \n\nChapter 1 - Introduction .............................................................................................................................................. 1 \n\n1.1.

In fact, \n\nthere is a strong economic incentive to perform separations with optimum \n\nefficiency. However the rational design of a typical separation process (for example, \n\ndistillation), we need the thermodynamic properties of mixtures. In particular, for a \n\nsystem that has two or more phases at some temperature and pressure, the \n\nequilibrium concentrations of all components in all phases are required. This makes \n\nThermodynamics the most important tool towards the optimization of one of the \n\ncornerstones of chemical engineering that is the separation of fluid mixtures [1]. \n\nThere are many ways to obtain information about the phase behavior of fluid \n\nmixtures, but the direct measurement of phase-equilibrium remains an important \n\nsource of information, though it is difficult and expensive to obtain accurate \n\nexperimental data [2]. Even when applied thermodynamics is used to calculate the \n\nphase behavior of a mixture, experimental data are important, because in this case, \n\nit is primarily a tool for analyzing the robustness of the experimental data. However, \n\nwithout some experimental information, this \u201cstretching\u201d cannot generate anything \n\nuseful. In fact, at least some experimental data points are needed to adjust \n\ninteraction parameters [1-3]. Therefore, for a progress in applied thermodynamics, \n\nthe role of experiments is essential [1].  \n\nUseful compilations of high-pressure fluid-phase-equilibria data have been done \n\nover the years by some authors. These compilations have proven to be helpful in a \n\nmuch faster way to seek experimental results for comparison. This compilation \n\ndivides the results per binary, ternary or multicomponent mixtures and by the type \n\nof method used (see chapter 3). Knapp et al. [4] presented the compiled data \n\ncovering the period 1900\u20131980. After these authors, others followed. Fornari et al. \n\n[5] covered 1978\u20131987, Dohrn and Brunner [6] 1988\u20131993, Christov and Dohrn [7] \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n2 \n\n1994\u20131999, Dohrn et al. [1] 2000-2004 and more recently Fonseca et al. [8] 2005-\n\n2008. In all of these papers we have found that the binary mixtures of water+alcohol \n\nor even the binary mixtures of primary alcohols have few results providing \n\nenforcement for acquiring such data. This work will contribute to increase the \n\nnumber of data in that area and complement the existing ones. \n\n \n\n1.1. Objectives  \n\n \n\nThis PhD project, included in the Technological Chemistry area, has the aim to \n\nprovide the community with accurate VLE data at high temperatures for \n\nwater+alcohols and alcohols+alcohols binary mixtures, to facilitate efficient high \n\ntemperature separation of these compounds through high temperature distillation. \n\nThe implementation of this thesis involves the following specific objectives: \n\n1. Upgrading the existing VLE flow apparatus, by improving the temperature \n\ncontrol of the equilibrium cell and pressure transducers accuracy, for \n\nethanol-water measurements up to 423.2K. \n\n \n\n2. Constructing a new VLE flow apparatus, including a new oven with a better \n\ntemperature control and capable of reaching temperatures up to 573.2K and \n\npressures up to 20 MPa. \n\n \n\n3. VLE measurements, in the temperature range 373.2 to 423.2K, for several \n\nbinary compositions of systems: \n\n? Ethanol \u2013 water; \n\n? 1-propanol \u2013 water;  \n\n? Ethanol+1-propanol. \n\n \n\n4. Modeling the VLE measurements using the Statistical Associating Fluid \n\nTheory for potentials of Variable Range (SAFT-VR) equation of state. \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n3 \n\n1.2. Outline of thesis \n\n \n\nIn chapter 1 an introduction is made presenting the main objectives and the outline \n\nof this thesis. \n\nIn Chapter 2, a brief review of Vapour-Liquid Equilibria (VLE) is given. Hundreds of \n\nequations representing the PVT behaviour of fluids have been proposed, few before \n\nvan der Waals, but mostly later. They have a central role in the thermodynamics of \n\nfluids. In this chapter a review of these theoretical methods of VLE property \n\nprediction is discussed as an introduction to the equation used to model the \n\nexperimental results, the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory for potentials of \n\nVariable Range (SAFT-VR). \n\nIn Chapter 3 we give a detailed description of the classification of VLE Experimental \n\nMethods, as a support and justification to our chapter 4, in which a description of \n\nthe chosen apparatus is made, as well as the experimental procedure. The \n\ndescription of the new apparatus (under construction) is also made. \n\nChapter 5 presents the results and discussion in the article form. Paper I refers to \n\nthe evaluation of performance of the VLE apparatus using water and water-ethanol \n\nsystem as their behaviour has been extensively studied and accurate data is \n\navailable for comparison. New data have been obtained for temperatures between \n\n363.3 and 423.7 K, and pressures up to 1 MPa. Paper II refers to the results of VLE \n\nmeasurements for the systems water-1-propanol, and Paper III the measurements \n\nfor the ethanol+1-propanol binary mixture. In all of these papers a correlation with \n\nthe SAFT-VR equation was carried out. These studies show that the phase equilibria \n\nis accurately described with this model.  \n\nIn Chapter 6 of this thesis, we will give the final conclusions and overall comments \n\nof our work and an outlook on the possible future research in related subjects. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n4 \n\n1.3.

Introduction \n\nThe scientific literature on fluid phase equilibria goes back well over 150 years and \n\nhas reached enormous proportions, including thousands of articles and hundreds of \n\nbooks and monographs. \n\nIn the chemical process industries, fluid mixtures are often separated into their \n\ncomponents by operations, such as distillation, absorption, and extraction. The \n\ndesign of such operations requires quantitative estimates of the partial equilibrium \n\nproperties of fluid mixtures. Whenever possible, such estimates should be based on \n\nreliable experimental data for the particular mixture at conditions of temperature, \n\npressure, and composition. \n\nUnfortunately, such data are often not available. In typical cases, only fragmentary \n\ndata are available and it is then necessary to reduce and correlate the limited data \n\nto make the best possible interpolations and extrapolations. One example is the \n\nstudy of the fluid-phase behavior of water-linear alcohols binary mixtures. Despite \n\nof the various studies of properties of these pure fluids, there is a lack of data at high \n\npressures and temperatures [1]. Phase equilibrium measurements are both difficult \n\nand expensive, and it is necessary to maximize the information and understand for \n\na particular system what can be obtained from a minimum amount of \n\nexperimentation. The costs of vapour liquid equilibria data vary with the type of \n\nequipment and system studied and the number of experiments. If we take into \n\naccount the equipment development, the costs are very high.  \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n6 \n\nFor systems of more than two components, the experimental work necessary to \n\nobtain a complete phase diagram reaches impractical requirements. For this and \n\nothers reasons the use of VLE computational modelling has grown. In this chapter \n\nwe talk briefly about the thermodynamics of the vapour-liquid equilibria, the \n\nevolution of the equations of state and the types of experimental methods for \n\nobtaining vapour-liquid equilibria data.  \n\n \n\n2.2. Thermodynamics of Vapour - Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) \n\nIn thermodynamics the term \u201cvapour-liquid equilibrium\u201d refers to systems with \n\nliquid and vapour phases in equilibrium. Here we consider a system in which a \n\nsingle liquid phase is in equilibrium with its vapour phase at a given temperature \n\nand pressure. In terms of Gibbs language we say that for every component i in the \n\nmixture, the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium is given by \n\nL\ni\n\nV\ni ff ?  \n\nequation 2.1 \n\nwhere \u0192i is the fugacity of component i, V for vapour and L for liquid [1]. To fully \n\nunderstand the equilibrium we need to quantify the quantities of interest that are \n\nthe temperature, the pressure, and the compositions of both phases. Given some of \n\nthese quantities, our task is to calculate the others. The fundamental problem is to \n\nrelate these fugacities with the mixture composition in both phases, because the \n\nfugacity of a component in a mixture depends on the temperature, pressure, and \n\ncomposition of the mixture.  \n\nTwo different strategies can be used to calculate the fugacities in both phases. In the \n\nfirst one we relate \nV\n\ni\nf  and \n\nL\n\ni\nf  to temperature, pressure, and mole fraction, \n\nintroducing the vapour-phase and liquid phase fugacity coefficients \nV\ni? and \n\nL\n\ni\n?  \n\nPy\n\nf\n\ni\n\nV\niV\n\ni ??  \nequation 2.2 \n\nPx\n\nf\n\ni\n\nL\n\niL\n\ni\n??  equation 2.3 \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n7 \n\nwhere yi is the vapour phase and  xi is the liquid phase molar fractions. The fugacity \n\ncoefficients can be calculated from vapour phase PVT y data, usually given by an \n\nequation of state [1].  \n\nDeviations from ideal behavior are more likely to occur in the liquid phase than in \n\nthe vapour phase. As a result of smaller intermolecular distances, the forces of \n\ninteraction between molecules in the liquid are considerably stronger. In contrast, \n\nthe vapour phase can be assumed to behave ideally from low to moderate pressures. \n\nAt higher pressures, the fugacity coefficients for the vapour phase must be \n\ncalculated using an equation of state [2].  \n\nIn the first strategy the calculations use equation 2.2 to determine , while for the \n\nliquid phase the fugacity of the component i by the equation 2.3. Furthermore, the \n\nfugacity coefficients of the components in both phases can be calculated using the \n\nrelation: \n\nZdV\nVn\n\nP\n\nRTV\nnVti\n\ni\n\nij\n\nln\n11\n\nln\n\n,,\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?  equation 2.4 \n\nwhere Z is the compressibility factor, pV/RT. This relation is very useful for cubic \n\nequations of state. \n\nIn the second strategy the phase behavior of real liquids is usually described by \n\nusing the activity coefficient concept i? : \n\n0\n\nii\n\nL\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\ni\n\nfx\n\nf\n\nx\n\na\n???  equation 2.5 \n\nwhere ai is the activity of the component i, and \n0\n\ni\nf  the fugacity of pure liquid at the \n\nsame temperature and pressure of the mixture (standard-state fugacity). In this case \n\nthe calculus is based on activity coefficient models, such as Margules, Van Laar, \n\nWilson, NRTL, UNIFAC and UNIQUAC in which we calculate phase equilibrium \n\ncompositions from excess Gibbs energy [2].  \n\nThe use of the first strategy for mixture calculations needs information on pure \n\ncomponents and like and unlike binary interactions. On the other hand, this \n\nv\n\ni\nf\n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n8 \n\napproach requires no standard states for the components in the mixtures, in \n\ncontrast with the second strategy. These advantages are especially important for \n\nmixtures containing supercritical components.   \n\nThe main disadvantage of the second strategy is the problem of the non-existence of \n\naccurate equation of state, which describes complex liquids, like associated fluids \n\nwith hydrogen bonding. Due to these advantages of the first strategy, it was chosen \n\nfor the current work. \n\nIn the next subchapter we will introduce the equation of state used in this work, \n\npresenting a review about the evolution of the equations of state, namely the cubic \n\nones, which have been used in many engineering calculations. \n\n \n\n2.3. Modelling Vapour - Liquid Equilibrium with Equations of State (EOS) \n\n \n\nEquations of state play an important role in chemical engineering design and they \n\nhave assumed an expanding role in the study of the phase equilibria of fluids and \n\nfluid mixtures [3]. In view of the variety of chemical species and applications, it is \n\nnot astonishing that until today hundreds of equations of state have been published; \n\nif variants are counted, too, the total exceeds thousands. It happens frequently that \n\nauthors of new equations of state, or of new variants of existing equations of state, \n\nreport significant improvements with regard to properties and substances they are \n\ninterested in, but fail to comment on the applicability or consequences beyond their \n\nown immediate field of research. The readers of such a publication sometimes have \n\ndifficulties to access its importance or applicability to their own problems. \n\nFurthermore, some sub-functions or terms of equations of state are known to be \n\nmore efficient than others for describing real fluids, especially if wide ranges of \n\ntemperatures and pressures are concerned. There is now a considerable expertise \n\navailable on the relation between functional forms of equations of state and their \n\ncapability to correlate various thermodynamic properties; unfortunately, this \n\ninformation is not always taken into account [4].  \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n9 \n\nGenerally, equations of state can be distinguished mainly in empirical, theoretical \n\nand semi-empirical (or semi-theoretical) equations. Comprehensive reviews can be \n\nfound in the works of many authors [5-10]. \n\nEmpirical equations usually need a large amount of experimental data of pure \n\ncomponents and contain a large number of substance-specific parameters with little \n\nphysical meaning. Their application is restricted to a very limited number of \n\nsubstances or just one component and their lack of predictive power beyond the \n\npressure\u2013temperature limit where they have been developed makes them \n\nimpractical for general purposes [11]. \n\nTheoretical equations are based on statistical thermodynamic insight. They have \n\nfewer substance-dependent parameters, and these parameters have physical \n\nmeaning. They require time-consuming calculations and suffer from limitations of \n\nexisting theories, making their predictions less accurate. However, they may \n\nrepresent property trends correctly even far away from their fitting range. For \n\ninstance, the well-known Virial Equation of State may be regarded as an empirical \n\nequation i.e., as a power series in density, with coefficients to be fitted to \n\nexperimental data, as well as, a theoretical equation if the coefficients are calculated \n\nfrom the appropriate integrals over Boltzmann factors [4,11].  \n\nSemi-empirical EOSs combine features of both theoretical and empirical equations, \n\nfor example, they provide good results for a large number of pure components and \n\ntheir predictions beyond the pressure\u2013temperature limit of the experimental data \n\nused to develop them are often acceptable. Due to these facts this is the most \n\nextensively used type of EOS for prediction of phase equilibrium and \n\nthermodynamic properties of fluids. Moreover, semi-empirical EOSs offer the fastest \n\nway to make quantitative predictions of thermophysical properties of pure \n\nsubstances and mixtures with few experimental determinations using few \n\nadjustable parameters [11]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n10 \n\n2.3.1. From Van der Waals to SAFT  \n\n \nMany equations of state have been proposed in the literature over the years with \n\neither an empirical, semi-empirical or theoretical basis. It would take a very long \n\nthesis to describe all of them, their weaknesses, their strengths and their limitations. \n\nSome are better for volumes, others for phase equilibria, but they all have something \n\nin common: their beginning.  \n\nThe history of the equation of state dates back to at least 1662 when Boyle \n\nconducted his experiments on air and deduced that, at a given temperature, the \n\nvolume of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure (PV=constant). \n\nThe effect of temperature was observed by Charles in 1787 and later by Gay-Lussac \n\nwho, in 1802, found the dependence of volume on temperature to be linear at \n\nconstant pressure. Together with Dalton\u2019s law of partial pressures, postulated in \n\n1801, these observations suggest the relation  \n\n??\ni\n\ni\nVRTnP /)(  equation 2.6 \n\nthat we recognize nowadays as the equation of state of a perfect gas mixture. After \n\nthis breakthrough, the work of Faraday (1823), Andrews (1869) and others succeed \n\nand paved the way towards the modern view of an equation of state presented by \n\nvan der Waals [12]. \n\nThe van der Waals equation was the first equation to predict vapour\u2013liquid \n\ncoexistence over a century ago.   \n\nThe history of this equation began in 1873, when van der Waals obtained his \n\ndoctor's degree for a thesis entitled \u201cOver de Continuiteit van den Gas- en \n\nVloeistoftoestand\u201d (on the continuity of the gas and liquid state \u2013 Figure 2.1), which \n\nput him in the foremost rank of physicists. In this thesis, he proposed an \"Equation \n\nof State\" embracing both the gaseous and liquid state. \n\nHe demonstrated that the two states of aggregation not only merge into each other \n\nin a continuous manner, but that they were in fact of the same nature. This equation \n\nof state was a dramatic improvement over the ideal gas law. It was van der Waals' \n\ngenius that made him see the necessity of taking into account the volumes of \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n11 \n\nmolecules and the intermolecular forces (\"van der Waals forces\", as they are now \n\ngenerally called) in establishing the relationship between the pressure, volume, and \n\ntemperature of gases and liquids. Van der Waals won the Nobel Prize for this work \n\nin 1910 [13].  \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Heike Kamerlingh Onnes (left) and van der Waals (right) in front \nof the helium-\u00b4liquefactor\u00b4, Leiden 1908 [13] \n\n \nError!

So it was clear to him that one \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n12 \n\nshould only use the equation with caution in P,V,T regions remote from those in \n\nwhich a and b had been determined. Nevertheless for many years, when his equation \n\nbecame well known, many physicists used it assuming a and b as true constants, \n\nignoring the reservations set out by van der Waals. Then the attempt to invent new \n\nequations started, some intended for special applications, others purely empirical \n\nand some based on theoretical arguments [14]. Van der Waals devoted much effort \n\nin trying to discover the dependence of his parameters with temperature and \n\ndensity1. And because the application of the equation to the liquid state didn\u2019t \n\nprovide with correction the properties of the state, many efforts were made by \n\nauthors in improving the above equation, replacing the repulsive part by a more \n\nconvenient expression and modifying the attractive term.  \n\nIn Tables 2.1 and 2.2 from we can view some of the modifications to these terms. \n\nPerhaps, the most important model for the modification of the van der Waals \n\nequation of state is the Redlich-Kwong equation [16]. It retains the original van der \n\nWaals hard-sphere term with the addition of a temperature- dependent attractive \n\nterm (equations 2.8 to 2.10) [3]: \n\n)(\n5.1\n\nbVRT\n\na\n\nbV\n\nV\n\nRT\n\npV\nZ\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n??  \n\nequation 2.8 \n\n \n\ncc\npTRa /4278.0\n\n5.22\n?  equation 2.9 \n\n \n\ncc\npRTb /0867.0?  equation 2.10 \n\nwhere the subscript c indicates properties at the critical point.

In contrast to the original Redlich-Kwong \n\nequation, Soave\u2019s modification fitted the experimental curve well and was able to \n\npredict the phase behavior of mixtures in the critical region, and today is one of the \n\nmost used equations together with the Peng-Robinson equation of state [3].  \n\n \n\nIn 1976, Peng and Robinson [18] redefined a(T) as: \n\n2\n5.0\n\n22\n\n1145724.0)(\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\ncc\n\nc\n\nT\n\nT\nk\n\np\n\nTR\nTa  \n\nequation 2.15 \n\n \n2\n\n26922.05422.137464.0 ?? ???k  \nequation 2.16 \n\n \n\ncc\npRTb /07780.0?  equation 2.17 \n\nRecognizing that the critical compressibility factor of the Redlich-Kwong equation \n\nis overestimated, they also proposed a different volume dependence.  \n\n? ?)()(\n)(\n\nbVbbVVRT\n\nTa\n\nbV\n\nV\n\nRT\n\npV\nZ\n\n???\n?\n\n?\n??  \n\nequation 2.18 \n\nThe Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR) slightly improves the prediction of liquid \n\nvolumes and predicts a critical compressibility factor of Zc=0.307.

The Peng-\n\nRobinson equation performed as well as Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation [3]. \n\nThe Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong equations are used widely in \n\nindustry. The advantages of these equations are that they can accurately and easily \n\nrepresent the relation among temperature, pressure, and phase compositions in \n\nbinary and multicomponent systems. They only require the critical properties and \n\nacentric factor for the generalized parameters. Little computer time is required and \n\ngood phase equilibrium correlations can be obtained. However, the success of these \n\nmodifications is restricted to the estimation of vapour pressure.

By simple, we mean molecules \n\nfor which the most important intermolecular forces are repulsion and dispersion \n\n(van der Waals attractions). Many hydrocarbons, natural gas constituents, simple \n\norganic molecules (e.g., methyl chloride, toluene), and simple inorganics (N2, CO, O2, \n\nN2O, etc.) fall within this category. \n\nNevertheless, many fluids, and particularly mixtures, do not fall within this simple \n\nclass, like polar solvents, hydrogen-bonded fluids, and so on. The correlation of data \n\nrequires complex and unphysical mixing rules and temperature dependent binary \n\nparameters, and the predictive capability of the approach is usually very poor. The \n\nreason for this is that, for such fluids, important new intermolecular forces come \n\ninto play [37]. \n\nThe first mixing rules were proposed by Zudkevitch and Joffe [38] for the Redlich \n\nKwong equation of state: \n\n? ?? ? 2/11\njiijij\n\ni\nii\n\nji\nijji\n\naaka\n\nbxb\n\naxxa\n\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n equations 2.21 \n\nAn important class of these complex fluids consists of those that associate to form \n\nrelatively long-lived dimers or higher n-mers. This class of fluids includes those in \n\nwhich hydrogen bonding, charge transfer, and other types of complex interactions \n\ncan occur, for example linear alcohols.  So they require special treatment when being \n\nmodeled. \n\nA more promising route for understanding the properties of these associating fluids \n\nis provided by recent theories that are firmly based in statistical mechanics. In \n\nprinciple, statistical mechanics provides formal recipes for calculating the structure \n\nand thermodynamics of a fluid given its intermolecular potential function. However, \n\nfor most systems of interest, this solution requires the use of one or more \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n18 \n\napproximations that ultimately determine the accuracy of the theory [37]. The next \n\nsection explains one of these new routes as it introduces one equation of state that \n\nhas grown in the past decade the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory, abbreviated \n\nas SAFT. \n\n \n\n2.3.2.  SAFT EOS \n\nIn 1990, Chapman et al. [39-40] proposed an approach capable of determining the \n\nproperties of the liquid and vapour phase. This model called Statistical Associating \n\nFluid Theory, normally called SAFT, was developed from the Wertheim\u2019s theory [41-\n\n46].  \n\nWithin the framework of SAFT, the EOS of a fluid is a perturbation expansion given \n\nin terms of the residual molar Helmholtz energy Ar, defined as the difference \n\nbetween the total molar Helmholtz energy and that of an ideal gas at the same \n\ntemperature T and molar density : \n\n),(),(),( ??? TATATA\nIDEALr\n\n??  \n \n\nequation 2.22 \n\nSAFT implicitly assumes that there are three major contributions to the total \n\nintermolecular potential of a given molecule:  \n\n? the repulsion-dispersion contribution typical of individual segments,  \n\n? the contribution due to the fact that these segments can form a chain,  \n\n? the contribution due to the possibility that some segments form association \n\ncomplexes with other molecules.  \n\nThe residual Helmholtz energy is given within the SAFT formalism (equation 2.23) \n\nas a sum of the contributions from these different intermolecular effects \n\nASSOCCHAINMONOr\nAAAA ???  \n\nequation 2.23 \n\nwhere the superscripts MONO, CHAIN, and ASSOC refer to the contributions from the \n\n\u201cmonomeric\u201d segments, from the formation of chains, and from the existence of \n\nassociation sites, respectively.  \n\nBy combining the above equations we obtain the usual forms of the SAFT equation: \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n19 \n\nASSOCCHAINMONOIDEAL\nAAAAA ????  \n\n \n\nequation 2.24 \n\nNkT\n\nA\n\nNkT\n\nA\n\nNkT\n\nA\n\nNkT\n\nA\n\nNkT\n\nA\nASSOCCHAINMONOIDEAL\n\n????  \n\n \n\nequation 2.25 \n\nwhere N is the number of molecules, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the absolute \n\ntemperature. \n\nHence, a SAFT fluid is a collection of monomers that can form covalent bonds; the \n\nmonomers can interact via repulsive and attractive (dispersion) forces and, in some \n\ncases, association interactions. The many different versions of SAFT essentially \n\ncorrespond to different choices for the monomer fluid and different theoretical \n\napproaches to the calculation of the monomer free energy and structure. Perhaps \n\nthe most popular are the Perturbed-Chain and Variable Range versions of the SAFT \n\napproach (PC-SAFT and SAFT-VR, respectively) [47]. In the next section we give a \n\nbrief overview on the model used to correlate our data, the SAFT-VR model.  \n\n \n \nSAFT-VR Model \n\nIn the approach of Mac Dowell et al. [48], water is represented as a single spherical \n\nsegment (m = 1) with four associating sites, two representing the hydrogen atoms \n\nand two the lone electron pairs. For ethanol and 1-propanol one association site \n\nrepresenting the hydroxyl hydrogen atom and two the oxygen lone electron pairs \n\nare included; in this case, the number of spherical segments is 1.533 accounting for \n\nthe elongated molecular shape (Figure 2.2). It should be noted that, both in the pure \n\ncompounds and in the mixture, the associative interactions are only allowed \n\nbetween sites of different type, namely \u201chydrogen-type\u201d sites can only interact with \n\n\u201celectron-type\u201d sites and vice versa. \n\n \n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n20 \n\n \nFigure 2.2 \u2013 SAFT-VR model for water (on the left) and alcohol (on the right) \n\n \nThe inter and intramolecular cross interactions between segments are obtained \n\nfrom the modified Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules [49]: \n\n2\n\njjii\n\nij\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n?  \n\n \n\nequation 2.26 \n\njjiiijij\nk ??? )1( ??  \n\n \n\nequation 2.27 \n\njjii\n\njjjjiiii\n\nijij\n??\n\n????\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n?  \n\n \n\nequation 2.28 \n\nBeing SAFT-VR a new model when compared to those that are traditional in \n\nChemical Engineering, the data available for the use of this type of correlation with \n\nbinary mixtures of water+alcohol and alcohol+alcohol is limited.

Introduction \n\nHigh-pressure phase behavior is often complex and difficult to predict. At high \n\npressures deviations from ideal behavior become much larger than at ambient or \n\nmoderate pressures. Therefore, the experimental investigation is often the only \n\nsuitable method to determine accurately the high-pressure phase behavior. Many \n\ndifferent methods are used to measure high-pressure phase equilibria. The reason \n\nis that no single method is suitable to determine all different VLE behavior at \n\ndifferent temperatures and pressures. \n\nAccording to Nagahama [1] there are four different methods to measure high \n\npressure phase equilibria:  \n\n1. Static method;  \n\n2. Recirculation method;  \n\n3. Flow method; \n\n4. Synthetic method. \n\nThis provides a well-structured, classification according mainly to the feeding type \n\nand sampling method mainly. However, some authors prefer to elaborate this \n\nclassification towards on how the compositions of the equilibrium phases are \n\ndetermined, analytically or not and whether the mixture to be investigated has been \n\nprepared (synthesized) with accurate composition known or not. This provides us \n\nwith two classes: \n\n1. Analytical methods; \n\n2. Synthetic methods. \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n24 \n\nIn each of these classes we can find many different methods divided into subclasses \n\naccording to several experimental conditions (Figure 3.1). The variety of \n\nexperimental methods reported is even more confusing, since various authors use \n\ndifferent names for the same experimental method. Expressions like \u2018static\u2019 or \n\n\u2018dynamic\u2019 are used in connection with many different methods [2]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Classification of experimental methods for VLE according to Dohrn et al. \n[3]  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n25 \n\n3.2. Static Method \n\nThe static method is illustrated in Figure 3.2. In this method the cell, with constant \n\nor variable volume, is filled with each substance and temperature and pressure are \n\nadjusted to allow the phase separation. Magnetic stirrers or rocking equipment are \n\nused to reach the equilibrium state. After that, samples are taken from both phases \n\nto be analyzed by appropriate techniques, such as Gas Chromatography (GC) and \n\nmass spectrometry.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Schematic diagram of a static apparatus for VLE measurements \n\nThe static method for VLE experiments under high pressure, has inherently several \n\nproblems such as sampling problems. By withdrawing a sample from the cell it can \n\ncause a change in the equilibrium state variables (pressure, temperature and \n\ncomposition). Also, due to the partial vaporization or condensation during sampling, \n\nthe analyzed sample composition may not be the same as that in the equilibrium cell \n\n[1]. However, for more than 40 years, this type of apparatus became increasingly \n\nimportant with the development made by Gibbs and van Ness [4]. At that time many \n\nothers followed [5-11] this new method in various ways. Kolbe and Gmehling [12] \n\ndeveloped and apparatus using this method, capable of measurements of vapour-\n\nliquid equilibria up to 423K and 1MPa. This work was used by the scientific \n\ncommunity for many years as a reference, and it was used to test our apparatus (see \n\nchapter 5 for Paper I).  \n\nDespite new advances for apparatus for vapour liquid equilibrium, the static method \n\nis still used today. Guo et al. [13] developed, for the analysis of vapour pressure and \n\nvapour + liquid equilibrium up to 400K and 3MPa, an apparatus based on the static \n\nAnalysis \n\n \n\nAnalysis \n\nP \n\nVapour \n\n \n\nLiquid \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n26 \n\nanalytic method with an internal stirrer and view windows (Figure 3.3). With this \n\napparatus, the authors report an improvement in the average absolute deviation of \n\nvapour phase mole fraction (AAD y) in comparison with literature data. However, \n\nthey obtained a higher average absolute relative deviation of pressure (AARD p), \n\ndue to the effect of sampling in the pressure. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Schematic of the experimental apparatus of Guo et al.

Recirculation Method  \n\nA schematic diagram of recirculation apparatus is given in Figure 3.4. This method \n\nis based in the use of two recirculating pumps, one for the liquid and the other for \n\nthe vapour phase. By recirculating the phase(s) the equilibrium state can be reached \n\nvery fast and the disturbance of the equilibrium state inherent to sampling can be \n\ndiminished using a special sampling device. When employing the recirculation \n\nmethod we must take care with the performance of the recirculating pumps and to \n\nthe temperature of the bath in which all parts of the apparatus are placed.  \n\nThese two reasons avoid the excessive pressure drop in the case of a good \n\nrecirculating pump, and partial vaporization or condensation in recirculating lines. \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n27 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Schematic diagram of a recirculation apparatus for VLE measurements \n\n \n\nIn the work of Ath\u00e8s et al. [14], the authors report a problem with their deviation in \n\ntemperature. In fact, the maximum temperature deviation at fixed liquid \n\ncomposition is of about 1.5 K. They attribute this deviation to some problems \n\ninherent to their recirculation method - Figure 3.5 - (partial condensation, pressure \n\nand temperature fluctuations) or to the uncertainty in the analysis of the ethanol \n\ncomposition.  \n\nThese problems are very serious for VLE measurement in the region close to the \n\ncritical point where a very small fluctuation in temperature and pressure can lead a \n\nbig change in phase behavior [1].   \n\n \n\nP \n\n      Vapour \n\nAnalysis                Analysis \n\n      Liquid \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n28 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5 - Flowchart of the vapour\u2013liquid equilibrium apparatus Labodest\u00ae [14] \n(1) electrical immersion heater; (2) mixing chamber; (3) contact path; (4) separation \nchamber; (5) solenoid valves; (6) vapour phase; (7) liquid phase; (8 and 9) circulation \nsteams; (10) sampling port. \n\n \n\n3.4. Synthetic Method  \n\nA schematic diagram of synthetic apparatus is given in Figure 3.4. This method is \n\nused to prepare a mixture of known composition (synthesize) and then to observe \n\nits behavior in a cell with visual observations. As shown in this figure, the synthetic \n\nmethod does not need sampling. After transferring the amounts of substances into \n\nthe cell the temperature and pressure are adjusted until the contents of the cell form \n\na homogeneous phase, whose mole fractions can be obtained from feed amount of \n\neach substance at the beginning. Then the pressure or temperature is varied until \n\nthe incipient formation of a new phase.  \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Schematic diagram of a synthetic apparatus for VLE measurements \n\n \n\nThe known composition, the temperature and the pressure define a point of the \n\nphase envelope. The cell is usually of the variable volume type. The advantages of \n\nthis method are that the difficulties regarding sampling are avoided, very simple \n\napparatus is used, and that the phase envelope and PVT behavior of a mixture can \n\nbe determined even near the critical conditions. However, the disadvantages are [1]: \n\n(1) Precise detection of incipient phase formation especially for dew point is \n\ndifficult and it causes inaccuracies in temperature and pressure readings. \n\n(2) The composition of coexisting phases can only be determined indirectly \n\nin binary mixtures and in general cannot be obtained in multicomponent \n\nmixtures. \n\nThe synthetic method includes the so-called \"dew- and bubble-point method\" and \n\nalso \"total pressure measurement method\". The former is just the same as that \n\nmentioned above and the latter is that where the amounts of substances transferred \n\ninto the cell changed at constant temperature, until the formation of a new phase \n\nappears.  \n\nAccording to Fonseca et al. [2] in his review of the experimental methods and \n\nsystems investigated in the period of 2005 to 2008, there is a tendency for \n\n                      P/T \n\n \n\nVapour \n\n \n\nLiquid \n\n \n\n              Piston \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n30 \n\nincreasing the amount of papers using these types of methods. According to their \n\nreview they are more used by the scientific community than the Analytical methods.  \n\nThese methods can be used where the analytical methods fail, i.e., when phase \n\nseparation is difficult, due to similar densities of the coexisting phases, e.g. near or \n\neven at critical points. Often the experimental procedure is easy and quick, and \n\nbecause no sampling is necessary, the equipment is rather inexpensive. On the other \n\nhand, it can be designed for extreme experimental conditions, as higher \n\ntemperatures and pressures rise the costs of equipment.  \n\nA disadvantage of this method is that they yield less information than the analytical \n\nones, being mainly used for binary or pseudo-binary mixtures [2]. \n\nA new experimental set-up for the measurement of phase equilibria at temperatures \n\nranging from 243 K to 353 K and pressures up to 20 MPa was developed by Fonseca \n\nand von Solms [15], making use of the synthetic isothermal method. A schematic \n\nrepresentation of the apparatus is presented in Figure 3.7. \n\nThe quality of this equipment was confirmed by the authors through several tests, \n\nincluding measurements along the three phase co-existence line for the system \n\nethane + methanol, the study of the solubility of methane in water, and of carbon \n\ndioxide in water. They found that the largest influence on the accuracy of the \n\nsolubility results is related to the ratio between the volumes of the two phases in \n\nequilibrium. Experiments with small volume of the vapour phase are less \n\nsusceptible to the influence of other sources of errors, resulting in a higher precision \n\nof the final results. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n31 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 - Schematic representation of the new experimental set-up for the \nmeasurement of multi-phase equilibria by a synthetic method.

Flow Method  \n\nA schematic diagram of the flow method is illustrated in Figure 3.8. This is an open \n\ncell, in which flows two or more components are flowing continuously in the cell, \n\nuntil steady-state is reached. This technique offers several advantages, mainly a \n\nshort residence time in the cell (avoiding thermal degradation) and the possibility \n\nof obtaining large amount of samples of both phases. However, the flow method is a \n\ndynamic system and it has some problems [1]:  \n\n(1) The precise control of both feed rate and liquid level in a cell must be done \n\nin order to keep the masses of components fixed; \n\n(2) A suitable sampling technique should be developed to collect complete \n\nsample, especially for multicomponent mixtures; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 Schematic diagram of a flow apparatus for VLE measurements \n\n \n\nAn application of this method develloped by Niesen et al.

Despite of this \n\nmethod being a flow method it can easily be upgrade to a recirculating flow method \n\nwhenever the quantity of the original sample is in question. To avoid the excessive \n\npressure drop a back pressure regulator can be installed diminishing the effects in \n\nthe equilibrium. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 \u2013Vapour liquid equilibrium apparatus of Niesen et al.

Originally constructed by Rosa et \n\nal. [1], and upgraded for this study, this apparatus was designed to collect vapour-\n\nliquid equilibrium data at temperatures up to 453.15K and pressures up to 1.7MPa. \n\nA second apparatus was built to extend the ranges of temperatures up to 573.15K \n\nand pressures up to 20MPa. Both instruments are described in this chapter.  \n\n \n\n4.1. Vapour-Liquid Equilibria Apparatus #1  \n\n \n\nThe first VLE apparatus used in this study is presented schematically in Figure 4.1 \n\nand shown in Figure 4.2. It is the same apparatus as that described and tested by \n\nRosa et al. [1], subjected to modifications in the pressure transducers and in the \n\noven stability in order to allow more accurate measurements. There are three main \n\nsections in this apparatus: sample feeding section, equilibrium section and sampling \n\nsection.  \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n35 \n\n \n\nSAMPLE \n\nVESSEL \n\nRELIEF \n\nVALVE \n\nFILTER \n\nMETERING \n\nPUMP \n\nMANOMETER \n\nDIGITAL MULTIMETER \n\nPLATINUM RESISTANCE \n\nTHERMOMETER \n\nHEAT \n\nEXCHANGER \n\nHEAT EXCHANGER VAPOR \n\nSAMPLE \n\nLIQUID \n\nSAMPLE \n\nDIGITAL MANOMETERS \n\nMETERING \n\nVALVE \n\nMETERING \n\nVALVE \n\nEQUILIBRIUM \n\nCELL \n\nBACKPRESSURE \n\nREGULATOR \n\nPREHEATER \n\nAIR BATH \n\nSECTION ONE \n\nSECTION TWO \n\nSECTION THREE \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Schematic of the VLE apparatus #1[1] \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Overall view of VLE apparatus #1.

The mixture to be studied is \n\nintroduced in a glass sample vessel, and forced to initiate the flow by suction by a \n\nmetering pump (LDC Analytical, model 396-89) through a protecting filter, to the \n\npreheater in the thermostat bath in section two. A relief valve in its way guaranties \n\na minimum pressure at the pump exit, controlled by a Bourdon tube type \n\nmanometer.

Equilibrium section \n\nThis section (Figure 4.4) consists on an isothermal air bath, containing the preheater \n\nand the equilibrium cell which is maintained at the desired temperature. The \n\npreheater is made from an aluminum cylindrical block, filled with copper filing dust, \n\nthrough which the flowing tube, made from stainless steel 316S (OD = 0.3175 cm) \n\npasses. This preheater has a sufficient length designed to minimize the temperature \n\nshock between the thermostat entry and the equilibrium cell and the sample \n\ndegradation. A second heat exchanger stabilizes the temperature of liquid fluid \n\nbefore the cell entry. The equilibrium cell (Figure 4.5) is a stainless steel 316 block, \n\nrated for 13MPa and 588.15 K, equipped with a glass window (Jerguson 11-R-20) to \n\nvisualize the liquid-vapour interface. The input line to the cell is made in an inverted \n\nU shape, to increase the heat and mass transfer between the two phases after the \n\nliquid flash. The thermostat is an air-bath controlled by a PID controller (OmRon, \n\nmodel E5CN) from 303.15K to 523.15K, within \u00b10.5% of indicated value given by \n\nsupplier. The temperature of the equilibrium is measured inside the high pressure \n\ncell, with the thermometer in the liquid phase, with a platinum resistance \n\nthermometer (OMEGA Tech. Co), and a 5\u00bd digit multimeter (Keithley, model 197) \n\ncalibrated together by Electr\u00f3nica Industrial de Alverca (EIA) (see Appendix 1 for \n\ncalibration certificate) with an expanded uncertainty 0.049K (k=2) for the \n\nTemperature working range. \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n38 \n\n \n\nDigital 5\u00bd Multimeter \n\nPlatinum Resistance \n\nThermometer \n\nMetering \n\nValve \n\nEquilibrium \n\nCell \n\nPreheater \n\nIsothermal bath \n\nThird \n\nSection \n\nFirst \n\nsection \n\nThird \n\nSection \n\nVapor \n\nLiquid \n\n1 \n2 3 4 5 \n\n6 \n\n2 \n\n1 \n\n4 \n\n3 \n\n6 \n\n5 \n\nMultiposition Digital Multimeter \nRTD\u2019s select or \n\nP.I.D.

Sampling section \n\nThis section of the apparatus is schematically represented in Figure 4.6. The vapour \n\nphase is sampled from the top of the cell, using a micro-metering valve to expand it \n\nto atmospheric pressure through a coil inside the thermostat to prevent pre-\n\ncondensation. This metering valve also determines the vapour flow rate. The vapour \n\nis then cooled in a condenser (heat exchanger) to room temperature, and collected \n\nin a small glass flask, prepared for the density determination. The liquid sample is \n\nobtained from the bottom of the equilibrium cell, at the operating pressure, and after \n\npassing through the condenser where it cools down, is expanded to the atmospheric \n\npressure using a micro-metering valve.  \n\nWhen the steady-state is reached the pressure of the equilibrium system is \n\nmeasured in the compressed liquid line with a pair of pressure transducers (GE \n\nDruck, model UNIK5000) with 0-0.4 and 0-1.7MPa calibrated by the manufacture \n\nwith uncertainties2 of \u00b1 0.02 and \u00b1 0.085 MPa respectively, and a digital pressure \n\nreadout, 4\u00bd digits (GE Druck model DPI282).  The composition of the equilibrium \n\nsample is determined by densimetry, using a (Anton Paar DSA 5000 M) densimeter3.  \n\nThe values of the density of the binary mixtures of ethanol\u2013water were obtained \n\nfrom published data and fitted to a polynomials in the molar fraction of ethanol \n\nwithin the range of the experimental measurements (see Appendix 2). The \n\nuncertainty of the molar fraction determination, taking into account the uncertainty \n\nin the density measurements was found to be ux = 0.0001. The same procedure was \n\nadopted for the other two binary mixtures.  \n\n \n\n                                                           \n2 Uncertainty of 0,05% full-scale given by the manufacture \n3 Calibrated with water (Millipore) and tetrachloroethylene (H&amp;D Fitzgerald - certified values) with an \nexpanded uncertainty of 0.01 kg m-3 (k =2) [2] \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n40 \n\n \n\nHeat Exchanger \nVapor Sample \n\nLiquid sample \n\nDigita l displays  \n\nMetering Valve \n\n1.9.9.9 \n\n1.9.9.9 \n\nPressure transducers \n\nSecond \n\nSection \n\nSecond \n\nsection \n\nLiquid \n\nVapor \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Schematic of the sampling section of the VLE apparatus #1 [1] \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. Evaluation and Testing of the VLE Apparatus #1 performance \n\n \n\nIn this section all the upgrades, evaluations and tests conducted to the vapour-liquid \n\nequilibrium apparatus #1 in the first year of this thesis are described. These tests \n\nwere carried out in order to better understanding the limitations of the equipment \n\nand to try to minimize variations in equilibrium, due to the operational procedure. \n\nFor this, the tests carried out to the circulating pump, to the air bath and to the \n\ncollecting valves are presented. To test the performance of the apparatus the water-\n\nethanol system was chosen, since there are accurate data for it obtained by Niesen \n\net al. [3]. The study was carried out at 423.7K and the agreement between both data, \n\nas shown in detailed in Chapter 5, in Paper I suggested the good performance of the \n\napparatus. \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n41 \n\n4.2.1. LDC Analytical Pump, model 396-74 \n\n \nAs described in chapter 3, the flow method has the advantage of short residence time \n\nin the cell avoiding thermal degradation and the possibility of obtaining large \n\namount of samples of both phases. However, the accurate control of both feed rate \n\nand liquid level in a cell must be done in order to keep the masses of components \n\nfixed. Whenever the flow rate changes, there is a direct perturbation in the system \n\nresulting in variations in both temperature and pressure as well in the mass of each \n\ncomponent. So, in order to minimize these perturbations, a test was performed to \n\nthe circulating pump to better understand the effect of changing the flow during the \n\nexperimental procedure. \n\nThe model used in this equipment provides us a variation of feeding between 0 and \n\n100% flow. For these extremes we have a corresponding flow velocity of 0.63 and \n\n6.38 ml.min-1 given by supplier. The equation that gives us the flow rate is given by: \n\n6333.0(%)0575.0)min.(\n1\n\n???\n?\n\nflowmlv  \nequation 4.1 \n\nIn tests carried out with pure ethanol the optimal feeding flow rate was found to be \n\nbetween 15 to 30%. For minor flow rates the cell would take too much time to fill \n\nand almost all the liquid entering the cell would vaporize. For higher flows the \n\nperturbation in the pressure was higher giving higher vapour pressure values. It was \n\nfound that in this case it was very difficult to fix the temperature. But for the control \n\nof the level in the equilibrium cell the feeding is not the only variable affecting this, \n\nthe sampling is also a big problem. The equilibrium between the entering and exiting \n\nof a sample must be in perfect harmony. For this in the next section we talk about \n\nthe optimization of the sampling valves. \n\n \n \n\n4.2.2. Micro-metering Valves \n\nAs mentioned in the description of the ELV apparatus, there are two micro-metering \n\nvalves for collection of the gas and liquid phase samples. In order to try to establish \n\na correspondence between the opening in the valve and the amount of ejected \n\nsample (ml) per unit time (minute), to acquire an equilibrium between the input and \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n42 \n\noutput of the samples, tests were performed making it possible to express this \n\nrelationship in equation 4.2 for liquid and equation 4.3 for vapour phases \n\n5674.21657.8)min.(\n1\n\n???\n?\n\nopeningmlv  \nequation 4.2 \n\n \n\n3298.07921.3)min.(\n1\n\n???\n?\n\nopeningmlv  equation 4.3 \n\nThese tests were conducted with a fixed input of 30% in the feeding pump, \n\nconsiderer the optimal feeding flow. Each time the opening of a valve was changed, \n\nan alteration in the equilibrium would occur; for minor openings there was an \n\nincrement in the vapour pressures. For an input of 30% we found that for achieving \n\nequilibrium in the cell level we had to have equilibrium between the amounts of \n\nboth exiting phases for low temperature values. For higher temperatures and for the \n\nsame feeding flow we had more vapour in the system, so the opening of the vapour \n\nvalve was consequently higher. These relations were based in experience of \n\ndeveloping an optimal relation between feeding and sampling.   \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Air Bath \n\nAs already mentioned, the VLE apparatus was constructed with an air bath to \n\ncontrol the temperature of the cell. The reason for choosing this over a liquid heat \n\ntransfer fluid (i.e. oil), which is more stable and not subject to the big convection \n\ncurrents, is based on the fact that for higher temperatures and with time the oil \n\ndegrades sometimes with toxic products, making it difficult to observe the liquid-\n\nvapour interface in the equilibrium cell. Another reason, no less important, is \n\nbecause of the industrialization process, that for a large scale industry, oils become \n\nexpensive as industrial heating requires high volumes. Moreover, some oils used at \n\nhigh temperatures are usually toxic. \n\nThe PID controller present in the bath with an uncertainty within \u00b10.5% of indicated \n\nvalue given by supplier, for temperatures of 423.2K we had uncertainties of 2.1K. \n\nDespite this the temperature of the equilibrium was measured in the liquid phase \n\nwith a platinum resistance thermometer inside the equilibrium cell, with a much \n\nbetter uncertainty. \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n43 \n\nIn order to assess the stability of the air bath experiments were performed at room \n\ntemperature and at 423.15K. In this evaluation temperature readings were obtained \n\nfrom the six RTD displayed in specific places as shown in Figure 4.4. Each reading \n\nwas the average of ten temperature readings (spaced by 1 minute) after two hours \n\nof stabilization. For the room temperature tests, the control temperature was the \n\nlaboratory ambient temperature. For higher temperatures the control temperature \n\nwas the PID controller temperature. For the standard of each RTD the temperatures \n\nof the six of them were registered with the air bath opened (for values see Appendix \n\n3).  \n\nBy introducing steel mesh, we observe a stabilizing the bath at higher temperatures, \n\nsince it decreases the convection. However, despite of this it is extremely difficult to \n\navoid the heterogeneous filling of the air bath. As it can be seen in Figure 4.7 the \n\nintroduction of the steel mesh at room temperature stabilizes the temperature \n\nreadings between the RTD\u2019s but increases the difference between the room \n\ntemperature and the RTD\u2019s readings. In Figure 4.8 we can also see that for 423.15K \n\nthe temperature between the Standard and RTD\u2019s are higher than \u00b15 K (for values \n\nsee Appendix 2). This makes the filling more problematic than helpful.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.7 \u2013 Stability of the air bath at 296.55K without any filling or with steel mesh \nfilling in comparison with the temperature measured with the open bath (standard). \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n44 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Stability of the air bath at 423.15K without any filling or with steel mesh \nin comparison with the PID controller temperature (standard). \n\n \n\n4.3. Vapour-Liquid Equilibria Apparatus #2  \n\nA second VLE flow apparatus was built to extend the VLE measurements up to \n\n20MPa at a maximum temperature of 573.15K (Figure 4.9). It represents a \n\ndevelopment of the original one (apparatus #1), allowing more accurate \n\nmeasurements. Although similar in the design, it presents some differences in the \n\nmentioned three sections. \n\nIn the sample feeding section we have a glass sample vessel, where the mixture is \n\npresent and forced to initiate the flow by suction by a similar metering pump (LDC \n\nAnalytical, model 396-89) through a protecting filter, to the oven in section two. In \n\nthis section we don\u2019t have a relief valve, but a bourdon tube type manometer gives \n\nus the pressure value at the pump exit. A back pressure regulator acts a safety device \n\nto avoid overpressure in the flowing system.  \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n45 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9\u2013 VLE apparatus #2  \n\n \n\nIn this apparatus an oven (Hotpack, model 213024) capable of reaching 623,15K \n\ncontaining the equilibrium cell will represent the equilibrium section. Once inside \n\nthis oven, the sample will pass by a 24m spiral of tubing (1/8\u201d O.D.) serving as a \n\npreheater, and then enter the high pressure cell.  \n\nIn the original high pressure cell the seal in the glass window is done through a \n\nTeflon? gasket. Since the Teflon? cannot be used above 450 K, a new high pressure \n\ncell was designed, which is shown in Figure 4.10.  \n\nThe cell is constructed from a cylindrical block of 316SS. The view port is a 4.445 cm \n\ndiameter by 0.635 cm thick sapphire window (Figure 4.10a). A 0.101 cm diameter, \n\n24 K gold o-ring will seal the sapphire window, making a tight seal due to the \n\npressure apply to this o-ring. The opposite end of the cell will have a dummy window \n\nwhich is made of 316SS, and that will be seal with another 24 K gold o-ring. Brass \n\nbackup shims will be used to hold the o-rings in place and to eventually distribute \n\nthe sealing force around the outer edge of the windows.

General operating instructions of the VLE apparatus and experimental \n\nprocedure \n\nIt is important to understand that for VLE measurements is more difficult to operate \n\na flow system than a static one. The equilibrium state required for the \n\nmeasurements must be achieved and maintained in a flow system in contrast to a \n\nmore stable batch system. For example, the temperature of a bath is much easier to \n\ncontrol than the temperature of a fluid flowing through a tube of 1/8\u2019\u2019 O.D. at \n\n100ml/min. For a binary system there are two degrees of freedom. Additionally, \n\nthere is the obvious requirement that when the steady-state is reached, relative \n\nproportion of the two phases should be maintained. For this equipment, the \n\ntemperature and vapour/liquid meniscus are controlled requiring the pressure to \n\nbe fixed and by setting the flow rates of the two phases.  \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n48 \n\n4.4.1. Starting \n\nThe first thing to do when starting from zero operating the VLE apparatus is to turn \n\non the entire electrical system, and the multimeter and let it stabilize for a while. \n\nThen all valves should be checked, all valves should be opened with exception of the \n\nvapour and liquid exit valves (the access valves to the transducers should be opened \n\ncarefully). Then the PID controller, or the oven controller (in case of VLE#2) should \n\nbe turned on and the temperature should be insert. After these initial tasks, the \n\nsystem is now ready for stabilize the temperature. After approximately 1 hour of \n\ntemperature stability, the pump is turned on in the minimum flow. In case of VLE#1 \n\nit can be established the exit pressure of the fluid with the relief valve. In this stage \n\nthe cell will start to fill. The back pressure (that can be closed for a filling more rapid \n\nof the cell) should be regulated for the maximum exit pressure of the pump, acting \n\nas a safety device to avoid overpressure in the flowing system. The liquid level \n\nshould be maintained controlling the vapour exit valve. \n\n \n\n4.4.2. Equilibrium \n\nThis is the more difficult stage to operate. The liquid level should be maintained by \n\ncontrolling the vapour and liquid exit valves, the pump flow and the back pressure \n\nregulator, in order to have the same quantity of sample at entry and exit of the \n\napparatus (steady-state mass flow). In practice, this is difficult because at minimum \n\nde-regulation in one of these possible controlling parameters, the equilibrium is \n\nperturbed and the level of liquid varies.  \n\n \n\n4.4.3. Sampling \n\nAfter about 15 minutes (maximum time calculated with the minimum flow rate for \n\nthe fluid to reach the end of the system) with the system is equilibrium, samples of \n\nthe vapour and liquid phase can be collected. . Samples are collected in glass flasks \n\nin ice baths for minimize the sample evaporation. As mentioned in section 4.1.3. the \n\ncomposition of the equilibrium sample was determined by densimetry, using a \n\ndensimeter. The values of the density of the binary mixtures were obtained from \n\npublished data (see references in Papers I, II and III) and fitted to polynomials in the \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n49 \n\nmolar fraction of ethanol within the range of the experimental measurements (for \n\nvalues see Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n4.4.4. Turning off \n\nWhen finished the fluid flow is turned to zero, as well as the pump. Then the PID \n\ncontroller or the oven is turned off, and all valves closed after a while with exception \n\nof the transducers valves. The temperature and pressure of the system is controlled \n\nto guaranty that it decreases safely. If necessary the exit valves are opened to \n\ndecrease the pressure and consequently the temperature more rapidly in the \n\nsystem, but these valves should be closed in the end. \n\n \n\n4.5.

Summary of Papers \n\n \n\nA flow apparatus originally built in the Faculty of Sciences from Lisbon University \n\nwas upgraded and tested to carry out vapour\u2013liquid equilibrium at high \n\ntemperatures for water\u2013alcohol binary mixtures in the temperature range of 363\u2013\n\n443 K and pressures up to 1.7 MPa. In Paper I experimental VLE data for the water\u2013\n\nethanol system is presented for temperatures between 363.3 and 423.7 K, and \n\npressures up to 1 MPa. The results obtained were compared with available literature \n\ndata to test the accuracy of the equipment and also with the predictions from SAFT-\n\nVR EOS. The performance of this VLE apparatus was found to be commensurate with \n\nthe design parameters and the required accuracy. \n\n \n\nPaper II is dedicated to the vapour-liquid equilibrium of the water-1-propanol \n\nbinary mixture for temperatures between 403.2 and 423.2K, and pressures up to \n\n0.72MPa. Vapour pressures for the pure 1-propanol were also obtained in the \n\ntemperature range from 383.2 to 423.2K and compared with literature. Once again \n\nthe agreement between experimental results and data from the literature was \n\nexcellent being the deviation in the vapour pressure of pure propanol well within \n\nthe mutual uncertainty of the vapour pressure, except at the highest temperature, \n\nwhere our value is 0.01 MPa higher. In all the experiments this temperature was \n\nfound to be the more unstable due to the limits of pressure and temperature that the \n\napparatus is under. \n\nThe SAFT-VR was found to be a good tool to predict the behavior of this binary \n\nmixture. However, the values of the binary interaction parameters were only slightly \n\nadjusted from those obtained for the (water + ethanol) system in order to obtain \n\nbetter predictions.  \n\n \n\nIn order to complete the cycle of binary mixtures using water, ethanol and 1-\n\npropanol, in Paper III, experimental vapour liquid equilibrium data for the ethanol-\n\n1-propanol binary mixture was obtained using the same flow apparatus. The SAFT-\n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n52 \n\nVT has proven as in Paper I that overestimates the vapour pressure for pure ethanol. \n\nThis fact was investigated in this paper, using the Wagner equation for pure ethanol \n\nas well as for pure 1-propanol, since the accurate representation of vapour pressure \n\ndata over a wide temperature range requires an equation of greater complexity. The \n\ngood agreement of previous experimental determinations and results from the \n\nliterature with this equation supported the idea that it is one of the most effectives \n\nin modelling the vapour pressure dependence on temperature.  \n\n  \n\nA new EOS for ethanol was also used to correlate our data, as well as the data from \n\nother authors with also good agreement supporting the fact that this apparatus \n\nprovides good and accurate data. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPaper I \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.F.

Overall Comments and Conclusions \n\nThe water-alcohol system is of much interest in the context of distillation processes, \n\nand as such, a detailed understanding of its properties is crucial. A key to the design \n\nof new, more energy-efficient processes and solvents is the ability to predict \n\nthermophysical properties accurately. This was one of the overall aims of this work. \n\nIn chapter 4, a description of a flow apparatus for the measurement of the vapour-\n\nliquid equilibria was made. This apparatus originally constructed by Rosa et al. [1], \n\nwas improved with new pressure transducers, new micro-metering valves and a \n\nnew relief valve. These upgrades had the goal of an improvement of the accuracy of \n\nthe pressure data and sampling. The evaluation and test of the apparatus was made \n\nwith a well-studied alcohol, such as ethanol, since accurate data exists with the \n\npurpose of evaluate the problems inherent to a flow apparatus. These tests and \n\nevaluations, despite of having an analytical fundament, are primarily operator and \n\nexperimental procedure dependent. Many conclusions were taken from these tests, \n\nbut most important it was the establishment of a new experimental procedure.  \n\n \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n80 \n\nThe determination of the composition of the mixtures in vapour and liquid phases \n\nwas performed with a density vs molar fraction calibration curve. The densimeters \n\nused for water + ethanol mixtures were calibrated using the classical method. \n\nHowever, for the remaining systems involving n-propanol the new densimeters \n\nwere calibrated according the methodology described by Lampreia and Nieto de \n\nCastro [2], more reliable and accurate. \n\nMeasurements with the water-ethanol, water-1-propanol and ethanol-1-propanol \n\nsystems at different temperatures were made and compared with literature data \n\nand with the SAFT-VR approach. For such known alcohols it was expected to find \n\nmore accurate data in the literature. However for the chosen temperatures there \n\nwasn\u2019t available the amount of data expected. And when existing, some do not have \n\nthe accuracy claimed. This tells us that this data is still used nowadays for designing \n\nbut also that a lot of work need to be done in this area. The comparison of our results, \n\nobtained with the flow method, with literature suggests the quality of working \n\nconditions of the apparatus, as well as their accuracy. \n\nThe comparison of our results with SAFT-VR predictions, a well based equation of \n\nstate, used by many authors as one of the best improvements of the originally SAFT \n\ntheory, showed that it can predict the behaviour of the binary mixtures under study. \n\nIt should be emphasized that in the calculations, the unlike interactions parameters \n\nwere obtained from Lorentz-Berthelot [3] type combining rules. For the system \n\nethanol + 1-propanol, an almost ideal solution, it was not necessary to use \n\ncorrections to the binary mixing rules (equations 2.24 to 2.26) The good \n\nperformance of the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules reflects the similarity \n\nbetween the two studied substances. The theoretical results are thus true \n\npredictions. The only setback was the prediction for pure ethanol vapour pressure. \n\nIn papers I and III, the theory has proven to overestimate the vapour pressure of \n\npure ethanol. For this a coherence test was performed to the pure alcohols vapour \n\npressures using the Wagner equation. The results show a good agreement between \n\nour data for the pure alcohols, previous experimental determinations [4-5] and the \n\nrecent equation of state of Schroeder et al. [6] for ethanol. They also show that \n\nWagner equation is one of the most effectives in modelling the vapour pressure \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n81 \n\ndependence on temperature, although minor corrections to the exponents are \n\nnecessary near the critical point, as used by Schroeder et al. [6].  \n\nIn order to obtained data for higher temperatures and pressures, a second \n\napparatus was designed using the same flow technique. This apparatus capable of \n\nreaching 573.15K and 20MPa will offer the possibility of complementing the first \n\none originating a larger range for pressure and temperature. The equilibrium cell \n\nwas also redesigned in order to allow these thermodynamic studies. The materials \n\n(the sapphire window used in the cell, the gold o-rings and all the materials in the \n\nvalves) used in this cell were also chosen very carefully in order to permit these \n\nhigher values of temperature and pressure.  \n\n \n\n6.2. Future Perspectives \n\n \n\nThe present work was a contribution for the scientific and industrial community of \n\naccurate vapour liquid equilibrium data for water and alcohol binary mixtures. \n\nDespite of the existing knowledge in this area, there is still immense work to be \n\ndone, mainly because nowadays we can obtain more accurate data.  \n\nAs mentioned earlier the cost of separation of two or more phases makes a \n\nsignificant contribution to the total cost of production. For the rational design of a \n\ntypical separation process (for example, distillation), we need accurate \n\nthermodynamic properties of mixtures, i.e. the equilibrium concentrations of all \n\ncomponents in all phases. This makes Thermodynamics the most important tool \n\ntowards the optimization of one of the cornerstones of chemical engineering, the \n\nseparation of fluid mixtures. This important fact enhances the necessity of \n\ncontinuing this work with the study of more binary mixtures containing both linear \n\nand branched alcohols. New equations of state can be applied to model our data. \n\nThis work to be reported in the future. \n\nThis type of work can continue in the future with higher carbon chain alcohols, liner \n\nand branched, as well with mixtures of pinenes, in a logical connection to previous \n\nour in our group on density and specific heat [7-9]. \n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Vapour-Liquid Equilibria of Water-Polyalcohol mixtures \n\nAna Cristino \n\n82 \n\nOne other focus of future work must be in mixtures with great impact in our \n\nindustries and Ionic liquids (ILs) have become an important class of novel solvents.  \n\nComposed mostly by a combination of organic cations with organic or inorganic \n\nanions with alkyl chain, the possibility of changing this combination provides an \n\nexcellent opportunity to adapt to a specific application becoming the most versatile \n\nsolvents. Excellent reviews of ionic liquids on separation techniques [10] \n\nthermodynamic of non-aqueous mixtures [11], analytical applications [12] and in \n\nthe field of catalysis [13] are available in the literature. However, much work \n\nremains to fully uncover the large potential of this novel class of liquids. For \n\nexample, the technology of absorption heat pumps and refrigeration using \n\nabsorption cooling cycles with ionic liquids has received growing attention in the \n\npast years.  Classical working fluids, such as LiBr/H2O (which is corrosive and \n\npresents solidification problems) and H2O+NH3 (which is toxic and an odor \n\nnuisance) systems have safety and environmental impacts that can be avoided \n\nsimply by replacing them with IL-natural refrigerants (e.g; IL-H2O, IL-CO2 and IL-\n\nNH3). This fact increases the need for information about the thermodynamic and \n\ntransport properties of the mixtures of ILs with H2O, CO2 or NH3 for a better choice \n\nfor new environmentally friendly absorption refrigerants. An extensive review on \n\nall these systems is currently under preparation, and will be published soon. Future \n\nwork will include data for these binary mixtures important not only for the scientific \n\ncommunity but also for the industry. \n\n \n\n6.3. Bibliography \n\n \n\n \n\n[1]. S.C.S.
