Por \noutro lado utilizou-se \u00e1gua ou um l\u00edquido i\u00f3nico como solvente para a dissolu\u00e7\u00e3o \ndos carboidratos no meio reacional. As temperaturas reacionais foram \nsuperiores a 150 \u00baC quando o solvente era a \u00e1gua, e inferiores a 150 \u00baC no caso \nde l\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos.

Carbohydrates are the most abundant natural organic polymers \non Earth. This work deals with the chemical valorisation of plant biomass, \nfocusing on the acid-catalysed conversion of carbohydrates (mono and \npolysaccharides) to furanic aldehydes, namely 2-furaldehyde (Fur) and 5-\nhydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf), which are valuable platform chemicals that \nhave the potential to replace a variety of oil derived chemicals and materials. \nThe investigated reaction systems can be divided into two types depending on \nthe solvent used to dissolve the carbohydrates in the reaction medium: water or \nionic liquid-based systems. The reaction temperatures were greater than \n150 \u00baC when the solvent was water, and lower than 150 \u00ba C in the cases of the \nionic liquid-based catalytic systems. As alternatives to liquid acids (typically \nused in the industrial production of Fur), solid acid catalysts were investigated \nin these reaction systems. Aiming at the identification of (soluble and insoluble) \nreaction products, complementary characterisation techniques were used \nnamely, FT-IR spectroscopy, liquid and solid state NMR spectroscopy, TGA, \nDSC and GC\u00d7GC-ToFMS analyses. Complex mixtures of soluble reaction \nproducts were obtained and different types of side reactions may occur. \nThe requirements to be put on the catalysts for these reaction systems partly \ndepend on the type of carbohydrates to be converted and the reaction \nconditions used.  The thermal stability is important due to the fact that formation \nof humins and catalyst coking phenomena are characteristically inherent to \nthese types of reactions systems leading to the need to regenerate the catalyst \nwhich can be effectively accomplished by calcination. Special attention was \ngiven to fully inorganic nanoporous solid acids, amorphous or crystalline, and \nconsisting of nano to micro-size particles. The investigated catalysts were \nsilicoaluminophosphates, aluminosilicates and zirconium-tungsten mixed \noxides which are versatile catalysts in that their physicochemical properties can \nbe fine-tuned to improve the catalytic performances in the conversion of \ndifferent substrates (e.g. introduction of mesoporosity and modification of the \nacid properties). The catalytic systems consisting of aluminosilicates as solid \nacids and water as solvent seem to be more effective in converting pentoses \nand related polysaccharides into Fur, than hexoses and related \npolysaccharides into Hmf. The investigated solid acids exhibited fairly good \nhydrothermal stabilities. On the other hand, ionic liquid-based catalytic systems \ncan allow reaching simultaneously high Fur and Hmf yields, particularly when \nHmf is obtained from D-fructose and related polysaccharides; however, catalyst \ndeactivation occurs and the catalytic reactions take place in homogeneous \nphase. As pointed out in a review of the state of the art on this topic, the \ndevelopment of truly heterogeneous ionic liquid-based catalytic systems for \nproducing Fur and Hmf in high yields remains a challenge. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nPublished SCI papers \n\n \n\n \n\n7- Antunes, M.

Renewable sources for energy and chemicals \n\n \n\n \n\nEnergy is the base of life of a modern industrial society. It is related to almost everything \n\nthat man does or wishes to do. In its many useful forms, it is a basic element that influences and \n\nlimits human standard of living and technological progress. Clearly, it is an essential support \n\nsystem for all of us.1 The intense population growth is expected to contribute to the growing \n\nworldwide demand for energy.2 Key strategies for efficient energy consist essentially of a safe \n\nsupply, low implementation costs, and environmental sustainability. Coal became the primary \n\nenergy resource and was the majority of coal produced is burned to produce heat and electric \n\npower. Other uses include the production of synthetic fuels and feedstock for the petrochemical \n\nindustry.1,3 During processing and/or combustion of coal, several compounds can be released into \n\nthe environment as harmful pollutants: sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen \n\nchloride, mercury vapor and a wide variety of trace metals are some examples.1-3 Furthermore the \n\nuse of coal may result in the production of CO2 which is the most important greenhouse gas in the \n\natmosphere, or volatile organic solvent emissions. The combustion of coal releases more CO2 per \n\nunit of heat released than combustion of oil or gas, since it has the lowest H/C ratio of the fossil \n\nfuels. Besides the greenhouse gas emissions, other issues, such as global warming or natural \n\nresource depletion, are becoming worldwide environmental concerns.2 A growing interest in \n\nobtaining cleaner fuels from coal (e.g. increasing demand for low sulfur coal) was noticed.2-11 A \n\ncoal-based economy remained prevalent until the discovery of petroleum (in the middle of XX \n\ncentury). Oil and natural gas began to substitute coal, in a fossil fuel based economy (i.e. as raw \n\nmaterials for the production of energy such as, heat, steam, electric power, and of solid, liquid or \n\ngaseous fuels).12,13 Natural gas started to be widely adopted for cooking, space heating, water \n\nheating and industrial uses in most urban areas, once it was possible to transport natural gas \n\nthrough a pipeline grid system. Pipelines were developed with the purpose of transporting oil \n\nfrom the producing regions to the refineries. An oil well is drilled to bring liquid petroleum to the \n\nsurface and the first pipeline was built in 1859 in Titusville, Pennsylvania.1  \n\nIndeed the fossil fuel era had a large impact on civilisation and industrial development. \n\nHowever, the threat to oil supplies in 1973 (the first oil shock), due to the depletion of the \n\nreserves of fossil fuels, and environmental issues led to major increases in oil prices.1 Intensive \n\nresearch programs started to be developed. The future energy production needs to be as clean as \n\npossible and economically viable. Renewable energy sources have become desirable because they \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n4 \n \n\ncan alleviate our dependence on the inevitable depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels, replacing \n\npart of the crude oil and natural gas which are the current major raw materials. 10,11,14-25 Based on \n\nthe predicted end of cheap oil by 2040,1,26 Lichtenthaler et al.15 reported that the curve for the \n\nutilisation of biofeedstocks should rise and intersect  the one for fossil raw materials between \n\n2030-2040 (Figure 1.1). According to these data, the transition in the evolution to a more bio-\n\nbased system continues somewhat inhibited by the cheaper fossil raw materials. Until the mid-\n\n1800s, renewable biomass sources, in the form of wood and farm residues/wastes, supplied the \n\nvast majority of the world\u2019s energy and fuel needs, and were the first principal sources of fuel and \n\nconstruction materials because of the little capital technological investment needed.1,2 \n\nAfterwards, coal and fossil fuels slowly displaced biomass consumption and became the preferred \n\nenergy sources. Presently, considerable achievements and rapid progress are being made in areas \n\nsuch as hydropower, geothermal energy, solar thermal technology, wind energy conversion, \n\nphotovoltaics and biomass conversion.2,11,17,27-29 Due to the first oil shock in the mid 1970s \n\nmentioned above, there is a reborn interest in using biomass to reduce oil consumption and \n\nimports.14 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1- Raw materials basis of the chemical industry in an historical perspective [adapted from \n\n15]. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n \n\n1.2.

Hemicelluloses are composed mainly of five-carbon \n\nmonosaccharides (pentoses such as xylose and arabinose) and some six-carbon monosaccharides \n\n(e.g. D-mannose, D-glucose and D-galactose).4,39 The most prevalent hemicellulose is D-xylan, \n\ncomposed of D-xylopyranosyl units linked by ?-1,4-glycosidic bonds. In hardwood, the D-xylan \n\nbackbone is modified with various side chains, including 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid linked to  \n\nD-xylose units via ?-(1,2)-glycosidic bonds and acetic acid that esterifies the D-xylose units at the \n\nO-2 or O-3 positions (Table 1.1). In non-acetylated softwood xylans, there are L-arabinofuranose \n\nresidues attached to the main chain by ?-(1,2) and/or ?-(1,3)-glycosidic linkages (Table 1.1).49 \n\nHemicellulose polymers are almost always branched possessing a wide variety of substituents as \n\nspecified for D-xylan (e.g. 4-O methyl glucuronic and galacturonic acid residues).50 Sugars are \n\nlinked together by ?-(1,4) or ?-(1,4)- glycosidic bonds, occasionally by ?-(1,3) and/or ?-(1,2)-\n\nglycosidic bonds (e.g. xylan polysaccharides composed of (pentose) xylose units) or yet by ?-(1-2)-\n\n?-glycosidic bonds (e.g. sucrose, Table 1.1).51-54  \n\nHemicelluloses possess a lower DOP (50-300) than cellulose and are more vulnerable to \n\nchemical attack (e.g. hydrolysis).25 Although abundant, cellulose and hemicelluloses are difficult to \n\ndissolve in water, particularly in the former case.39 The hemicelluloses and lignin provide a \n\nprotective cover in the surroudings of cellulose and should be removed to enable the efficient \n\nhydrolysis of cellulose.39 The removal of this protective cover is possible by a chemical treatment \n\nusing an appropriate acid catalyst.25 The high level of hydrogen bonding among the \n\npolysaccharide chains makes it difficult to depolymerise cellulose. Starch and inulin are less \n\nabundant carbohydrates than cellulose and hemicelluloses.4,36 Inulin is a polymer composed of \n\nfructose units linked by ?-(2,1) glycosidic bonds (Table 1.1). Starch consists of glucose units joined  \n\nby ?-glycosidic bonds and is composed of amilopectin (ca. 75-80 wt.%) and amylose (ca. 20-25 \n\nwt.%, Table 1.1).55,56 In amilopectin the glucose units are linked in a linear fashion via ?-(1,4)-\n\nglycosidic bonds and branching occurs via ?-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds. Amylose is essentially a linear \n\npolymer made up of ?-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds;  it is less soluble in water than amilopectin and is \n\nhydrolysed more slowly.57 Other carbohydrates include disaccharides like D-cellobiose (two \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________9 \n\n \n\nglucose units linked by a ?-(1,4)-glycosidic bond), D-maltose (two glucose units linked by a ?-(1,4)-\n\nglycosidic bond) and D-sucrose (one glucose and one fructose units linked via an ether bond \n\nbetween C-1 on the glucosyl unit and C-2 on the fructosyl unit; ?-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-2)-?-D-\n\nfructofuranoside).

Afterwards, Emmett observed that Fur can be \n\nobtained from vegetable substances. Later, in 1840, Stenhouse found that Fur could be produced \n\nby distilling a wide variety of crop materials (e. g. corn cobs, oat husks, bran, sawdust, sugar cane \n\nbagasse, rice and peanut) from agricultural waste rich in pentosans using an aqueous solution of \n\nH2SO4, and he attributed the empirical formula C5H4O2 to Fur.\n76,77 The chemical structure of Fur \n\nwas determined by the chemist Carl Harries in 1901 as cited by Dalin Yebo.78 It consists of a \n\nfuranic ring (aromatic character) with an aldehyde substituent group (Figures 1.6 and 1.8), has a \n\nboiling point of 161.7 \u00b0C,79,80 and is a colourless liquid that in the presence of oxygen suffers auto-\n\noxidation becoming dark red/brown in colour.72 Generally, Fur is produced from pentosans such \n\nas xylans which are acid-hydrolysed to D-xylose (an aldopentose) and the latter is dehydrated into \n\nFur (Figure 1.8).25 \n\n \n  \n\n1.3.1.1.

In the \u201canalytical Fur process\u201d for the quantitative \n\ndetermination of the pentose, the substance to be analysed is added to H3PO4 saturated with \n\nNaCl to increase the achievement of the boiling point, which is ca. 110 \u00b0C, temperature at which \n\nthe water vapor undergoes superheating. In the case of the conventional processes mentioned \n\nabove, the remaining Fur in the liquid phase reacts with itself or with intermediates of the \n\nconversion of pentosans to Fur in the presence of an acid catalyst. On the other hand, in the case \n\nof the analytical process, the mixture is brought to boiling and is maintained as such throughout \n\nthe digestion period. In this process Fur is shifted from the liquid into the vapor phase where it \n\ndoes not undergo loss reactions, since the vapor phase does not contain the active acid species. \n\nThis cannot be achieved in conventional industrial processes, because at any pressure, condensing \n\nsteam is thermodynamically incapable of inducing an aqueous pentose solution to boil (due to the \n\nelevated boiling point). Thus Fur generated is left temporarily in the liquid phase.58 \n\nSeveral advances have been made to avoid Fur loss reactions in the liquid phase. \n\nImproved Fur yields were obtained by processes operating at higher temperatures (> 200 \u00b0C) such \n\nas Supratherm, Stakes, Suprayield and Montane (Table 1.2). The current production of Fur uses \n\nhigh pressure steam to heat the reaction.84 Due to the entropy effect at higher temperatures, the \n\nformation of larger molecules by condensation of Fur is avoided.84,85 The Suprayield process is a \n\ngood example that demonstrates this effect. It was invented by Zeitsch in 1999,86 and developed \n\nby International Furan Technology Ltd. in South Africa, which is a member of DalinYebo group \n\n(further founded in 2001).87  In this process, the liquid phase is heated to the primary \n\ntemperature (240 \u00b0C) with steam for a short time (the secondary temperature should not be \n\nbelow 180 \u00b0C to avoid slow reactions.58,85 The higher the primary temperature the lower is the \n\nneed for an acid, which should not be H2SO4  (to avoid losses by sulfonation) nor HCl (causes \n\ncorrosion) or HNO3 (due to nitration). H3PO4 was the preferred acid because it does not cause any \n\nside reaction.58,78 During the heating, the steam (Fur-water vapor mixture) condenses and the \n\nmoisture content of the reactor is increased.85 When the pressure in the reactor is gradually \n\ndecreased below the vapor pressure of the liquid, the liquid phase boils and the Fur is removed \n\nfrom the reaction solution through a stripping column. The Fur rich vapor mixture formed is then \n\ncondensed.58,84,85 As long as the vapor is separated from the liquid phase, the solution cools and \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________19 \n\n \n\nthe vapor pressure decreases, making it necessary to continue lowering the reactor pressure.85 \n\nThe limited solubility of Fur in water (8.3% at 20 \u00b0C),84 facilitates the separation of the Fur rich \n\nlower phase from the upper phase in a decanter. After the separation, the commercial product is \n\nobtained by purification processes (e.g. by distillation)  while the water-rich upper phase is \n\nrecycled from the decanter back to the stripper column as reflux.84 Apart from Suprayield, there \n\nare other patented processes, such as Verdernikovs,88-90 CIMV (Compagnie Industrielle de la \n\nMati\u00e8re V\u00e9g\u00e9table),91 Lignol, 92,93 MTC (Multi-Turbin-Column),94 or Chempolis.95,96 The CIMV is the \n\nonly technology in the world today that can cleanly recycle the three main components of the \n\nvegetable matter (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) of lignocellulosic feedstock, and separate \n\nthem into intermediary products, such as sugar syrup, for both chemical and biotechnology \n\nindustries. The refining of these syrups (mainly composed of C-5 sugars and principally D-xylose) \n\nresults in the production of Fur and its many derivatives.97  In the case of the MTC process, \n\nextractions with toluene and distillation under reduced pressure were carried out to prevent \n\nreactions of Fur with organic acids.85 Not all the processes need an acid since the organic acids \n\nformed as by-products of the decomposition of the raw materials may act as catalysts in \n\nautocatalytic reaction mechanisms. Some of these processes are represented in Table 1.2 \n\n(Rosenlew, Supratherm, Stakes, CIMV or Chempolis).  \n\nFur can be obtained via sulfite pulping (discovery by Tilghman in 1866) which allow white \n\ncellulose fibers to be obtained by treating wood in aqueous solution of calcium bisulfite Ca(HSO3)2 \n\nunder reduced pressure (Figure 1.10). Lignin present in the wood reacts with sulfite to form \n\nwater-soluble sulfonic acids, liberating the fibers of the wood. The reaction requires a \n\ntemperature of 140 \u00b0C and the presence of an acid to permit the conversion of pentosans to Fur. \n\nThe Fur yield can be increased by recovering the Fur that exists in the liquor.58 However, the \n\npentose in calcium sulfite waste liquors is not used to produce Fur because during the digestion at \n\nhigher pressures a super saturation with CaSO4 occurs, due to the reduction of sulfur dioxide to \n\ndithionate (Equation 1.4). Some processes that operate with sulfite liquor to produce Fur are \n\nlisted in Table 1.3.58 \n\n \n\nCaSO4 + SO2 CaS2O6  \n\nEquation 1.4- Reduction of SO2 to S2O6.\n58 \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n20 \n \n\nFigure  1.10- Flow diagram of the sulfite\n\n \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nFlow diagram of the sulfite pulping process [adapted from 58]. \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________21 \n\n \n\nTable 1.2 -Industrial,a patented,b and other studiedc processes for production of 2-furaldehyde (Fur). \n\nIndustrial Process Country Catalyst Reactor \n(operation mode) \n\nTemperature \n\n(\u00b0C) \nReaction \nTime (h) \n\nYFur (wt. %) Process \nduration  \n\nRef \n\nQuaker Oats \na\n U.S.A.

V. founded in 1994 in the Netherlands is the leading \n\nmarket provider in the field of Fur and furfuryl alcohol worldwide: Fur is produced in one of the \n\nworld\u2019s largest Fur facilities, Central Romana Corporation, located in the Dominican Republic, and \n\nconverted to furfuryl alcohol at the related party, TransFuran Chemicals in Belgium.65 The \n\nDalinYebo group founded in 2001 also markets and sells Fur.132  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2. Applications \n\n  \n\n \n\nFur is a key chemical used in the synthesis of a wide range of added-value compounds and \n\nnon-petroleum derived chemicals that have several present and potential applications in plastics, \n\npharmaceutical,58,106,130 and agrochemical industries.58 Presently Fur is used as a solvent to \n\nremove aromatic compounds from lubricating oils and diesel fuels,58,106,130 and to obtain \n\nunsaturated compounds from vegetable oils to make drying oils; as a fungicide for  growing plants \n\nand wood; and as a nematocide.58 The major use of Fur (ca. 65%) is as an intermediate for the \n\nsynthesis of furfuryl alcohol (FA) which in turn is essentially used for producing furan resins, which \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n______________________________________________________________________________ \n24 \n \n\nare used as binding agents in foundry technologies (e.g. urea furan resin, a binding material used \n\nin metallurgy for heavy metals and precision casts and dies).71,80,106,130,133-136 Fur is used as an \n\nintermediate to produce surface coatings,72 polymers,71,72 mortar, adhesives for foundry cores and \n\nmoulds, boiler, and floor grouting (by FA),72 nylons and lubricants.106,130   \n\nFigure 1.11 illustrates some of the added-value products obtainable from Fur.80,137 Fur can \n\nbe hydrogenated to tetrahydro-2-furaldehyde (THFF) (which in turn by self-aldol condensation \n\ncan be converted to a diesel fuel),138 furfuryl alcohol (FA) (for furanic resins or plastics),80,137,139,140 \n\n2-methylfuran (MF), tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) and methyltetrahydrofuran \n\n(MTHF).11,32,75,80,113 FA is one of the most common products of Fur produced worldwide \n\nrepresenting 65% of Fur conversion.58 MTHF (20 wt.% oxygen content) was approved by the \n\nUSDOE (US Department of Energy) for use as gasoline additive in P series type fuels and is a \n\ncomponent of P-series fuel.11,141  P series fuels are defined as renewable and non-petroleum clear \n\nliquid fuels that can substitute gasoline and are used in flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) and spark-ignition \n\nengines.142 Besides MTHF, P series fuels contain a mixture of ethanol (55%) and pentane-plus \n\n(27.5%) and normal butane (in a vestigious quantity).143 It was patented in 1997,144 and an \n\nexclusive license for commercialisation is owned by the Pure Energy Corporation (PEC) since 1998, \n\nwhen P-Series were recognised as alternative fuels in accordance with the Energy Police Act of \n\n1992.143 Over aqueous phase processing, Fur is an intermediate that can produce liquid straight-\n\nchain alkanes in the range C8-13 useful to make jet and diesel fuels.\n11,123,138,145-147 Jet fuels are \n\ncomplex hydrocarbon mixtures that consist of different classes such as paraffin, naphthene and \n\naromatics, which were especially designed as an aviation fuel for use in aircraft by gas-turbine \n\nengines.145,148,149 Fur can be transformed into furan, a widely used solvent in industry, by pyrolysis \n\n(which promotes the break of the aldehyde group) or by hot alkali (since fused alkali allows the \n\noxidation of the aldehyde group into furoic acid and subsequent descarboxylation.150 Furthermore \n\nfuran gives THF (by hydrogenation),106,140 acetylfuran and difuranpropane (DFP) that by \n\nhydrogenation gives  (Di-tetrahydrofuran)propane (DTHFP).106 Furoic acid is converted to \n\ntetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid (THFAC) by hydrogenation, or to methylfuran-2-carboxylate \n\n(MCFAT) by esterification.106 Methyltetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylate (MTHFAT) and \n\ntetrahydrofuran-2-methanamine (THFAM) are other Fur derivatives.106 \n\n \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.11- 2-Furaldehyde (Fur)\n \n\n \n\nDesirable jet and diesel fuel range alkanes (C8\n\naldol condensation of Fur into \n\ndehydration and hydrogenation \n\nachieved high yields of alkanes by this\n\ncarbonyl group of Fur and the carbo\n\nwhich by dehydration gives origin to \n\nmonomer (F-Ac, C8 product) and \n\nhydrogenation gives alcohol H\n\nhydrodeoxygenation.

Newth175 was the first to publish a review about Hmf in 1951, and many others \n\nwere followed which keep on growing every year very fast, proving its great \n\nimportance.15,38,71,74,151,176-185 \n\nThe production of Hmf has not gone beyond the pilot plant scale.186,187 In 1993 an \n\nevaluation of the costs to produce Hmf indicated a Hmf marketing price of at least 2500 \u20ac.ton-1.15 \n\nMore recently, Dumesic reported a techno-economic analysis of Hmf production from D-fructose \n\nand referred that the market for Hmf could de comparable with that of terephthalic acid (which in \n\nthe USA exceeds 4 million metric ton.year-1).20 For the production of Hmf from D-fructose the \n\nestimated costs were about $ 102.4 million for the equipment and $ 36.4 million for catalyst first \n\ncharge and $ 258.500 million for replacement every two years.20 The estimated costs are quite \n\nhigh for a bulk-scale industrial product and the present politico-economical situation still favours \n\nthe petroleum route.71  \n\nEfforts need to be taken into consideration because worldwide production can be larger \n\nfor Hmf than for Fur as a result of the more abundant terrestrial resources containing hexoses \n\nthan those containing pentoses. A successful commercial implementation to produce Hmf \n\ndepends partly on the feedstocks availability and prices, lower capital costs and higher price for \n\nthe by-product levulinic acid (which currently is $ 300.ton-1)20; there are some important \n\nchallenges to lower the price of Hmf as a biobased platform chemical. \n\n \n\nHmf can be used for the synthesis of dialdehydes, ethers, amino alcohols and other \n\norganic intermediates, that lead to solvents (e.g. furan, THFA and FA),188 surface-active agents, \n\nphytosanitary products and phenolic resins.34,74,189 FA is obtained by the addition of H2O to Hmf \n\n(Figure 1.13).38,190 Phenolic resins are formed by acid catalysed reaction of Hmf with phenol.15,71,191 \n\nHmf can be converted into diesel fuel additives138,192,193 and biofuels,194 similar to Fur. To obtain \n\nkerosene and other diesel fuel intermediates there is the need to increase the carbon chain \n\nlength of Hmf,70 which is done by aldol condensation and further aqueous phase dehydration-\n\nhydrogenation. The aldol condensation of Hmf might consist of a non  C-C coupling or a cross \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n______________________________________________________________________________ \n28 \n \n\ncoupling (C-C) reaction.70 In the non C-C coupling, furan derivatives (alkoxylmethyl-2-furaldehyde \n\nethers or esters) are formed by condensation with lower alcohols or carboxylic acids through the \n\n\u2013OH group of Hmf.195 In the cross coupling reaction, Hmf suffers cross condensation with acetone \n\n(or other aldehydes or ketones with at least one acidic ?-proton). When using acetone the \n\nproduct obtained is 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfurylidene acetophenone (HMFIA) which by further \n\nhydrogenation of the keto group gives origin to 3-(hydroxybutenyl)-hydroxymethylfuran (HB-\n\nHMF).33,190 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfurylidene ester (HMFI) is obtained by aldol-crossed \n\ncondensation, (Figure 1.13).33,71 Since Hmf does not have an ?-H it cannot undergo self-aldol \n\ncondensation.

In the case of insoluble solid acids some are organic materials such as, acid ion-\n\nexchange resins (Br\u00f6nsted acids), others are inorganic such as zeolites and zeotype materials \n\n(possess Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acid sites), or hybrid organic-inorganic materials such as mesoporous \n\nsilicas functionalised with sulfonic acid groups (Br\u00f6nsted acid sites).  \n\nMineral acids such as H2SO4 or HCl have been extensively used as catalysts for the \n\nconversion of carbohydrates to furanic aldehydes. In particular H2SO4 continues to be the \n\ncommon industrial catalyst. However it poses risks to human health (high toxicity), the \n\nenvironment (due to the difficult catalyst recovery/recycling and sulfur-containing by-products \n\nresulting from catalyst residues leading to expensive purification procedures), and equipment \n\ncorrosion hazards.58,240,264 For these reasons the production of Fur and Hmf is one process where \n\nthe demand for green chemistry is stimulating the use of recyclable and less-toxic acid \n\ncatalysts.265,266  \n\nHeterogeneous acid catalysts are promising alternatives to homogeneous ones because \n\ntheir use may allow overcoming typical disadvantages associated with the use of homogeneous \n\ncatalysts: e.g. the separation of the catalyst from the reaction products is easier (e.g. via filtration) \n\nwhich can lower the costs of the process, as separation processes typically represent more than \n\nhalf of the total investment in the equipment.267,268 Neutralisation steps at the end of the reaction \n\nin the presence of mineral acids (with the formation of waste products) are avoided through the \n\nuse of heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts can be quite resistent to high \n\ntemperatures, which is favourable in terms of the catalyst lifetime. Solid acids can lead to higher \n\nselectivities towards Hmf than homogeneous ones.239,267 The acid properties of solid acid catalysts \n\ncan be fine-tuned in order to improve the Fur/Hmf yield.74 The design of selective catalysts with \n\nisolated active sites for one-pot transformation processes is a challenge.269 The literature data \n\nrelated to the use of saccharides to Fur and Hmf using water or organic solvents is summarised in \n\nthe Section 1.4.2. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes

Conversion of saccharides to furanic aldehydes in the presence of \n\nheterogeneous catalysts \n\n \n\n \n\nSince the pentoses and hexoses and the respective di/oligo/polysaccharides are polar and \n\nnon-volatile compounds, their conversion to Hmf and Fur is restricted to liquid-phase processing. \n\nThe solubilisation of polysaccharides into the reaction medium is one of the requirements to \n\navoid detrimental mass transfer limitations and to maximise feedstock loadings, which is desirable \n\nfor process intensification. This is particularly important in the cases of insoluble solid acid \n\ncatalysts (to avoid detrimental mass transfer limitation associated with the catalyst and reagent \n\nbeing in the solid state). Employing an aqueous-phase reaction medium has important \n\nadvantages: water is cheap, non-toxic, non-flammable and a clean solvent, increasing the \n\neconomic feasibility of the process.264 The use of an immiscible organic co-solvent is known to \n\nallow enchanced Fur or Hmf yields; in this way the target products are extracted as they are \n\nformed from the aqueous phase, avoiding undesired side reactions. Rom\u00e1n-Leshkov et al.35 \n\nproposed a two-phase reactor system for the dehydration of D-fructose to Hmf (Figure 1.23). The \n\naqueous phase consisted of a mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and poly(1-vinyl-2-\n\npyrrolidinone) allowing the suppression of undesired side reactions; the organic phase consisted \n\nof isobutylmethylketone (IBMK) which continuously extracts Hmf. The countercurrent extractor \n\nwas employed to remove the Hmf remaining in the aqueous phase.35 Afterwards, the same group \n\ninvestigated the solvent effect on the dehydration of D-fructose in biphasic system with saturated \n\ninorganic salt, with THF as extract solvent, reaching an outstanding Hmf selectivity of 83%.258 \n\nFurthermore, one pot procedures involving multiple catalytic steps such as reaction and \n\nseparation of products can minimise investment in equipment and energy consumption.269 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n \n\nFigure 1.23- Conversion of saccharides to \n\n(Hmf) using an aqueous-organic biphasic solvent system, under b\n\nfrom 35,74].   \n\n \n\n \n\nAlthough cellulose is one of the most abundant natural polymers and attractive \n\nrenewable feedstocks, it is insoluble in water and most organic solvents and not easy to hydrolyse \n\nbecause of its compact crystalline structure (formed mainly by inter\n\nhydrogen bonds).25,393,394 Pre-\n\nallow the crystallinity of cellulose to be decreased, facilitating its \n\nhas been successfully used to dissolve cellulose \n\nmineral acids due to the fact of being less corrosive and due to i\n\ncost.400  The addition of H3PO\n\nof cellulose leading to cellulose\n\ngroups of cellulose chains and H\n\nH2O or a hydrogen ion.\n398 \n\nFur/Hmf yields.

Microporous pillared-clay catalysts are layered montmorillonite sheets with \n\nintercalated metal oxide pillars and larger pores widths (> 10 \u00c5, enough to accommodate             \n\nD-glucose, 8.6 \u00c5) than zeolites, promote high conversions with high selectivities to organic acids \n\nbut low selectivities to Hmf. Lourvanij et al.387 stated that larger pore sizes  allowed D-glucose to \n\ndiffuse into the microporous matrix but also trapped the Hmf molecule, directing the reaction to \n\nfinal organic acids. Some examples are aluminium pillared montmorillonite (Al-PM),357,387 Cr-PM,   \n\nFe-PM and H-PM387  (Table 1.6). Aluminosilicate catalysts (e.g. zeolite) seem more attractive in \n\nterms of costs and/or availability of the sources of the constituent elements (Al, Si) than \n\ntransition-metal containing ones such as, H-AM-11 (microporous niobium silicate), Nb-MCM-41 \n\n(mesoporous niobium silicate),291,292 Pt-MCM-48,290 Pt/Al2O3,\n378 WO3/ZrO2,\n\n245,271,278 \n\nZrO2,\n296,297,363,365-368 TiO2,\n\n281,296,297,363,365,366,368,372 TiO2-ZrO2,\n297 Ta2O5.nH2O,\n\n379 and CeO2\n372 (Table 1.6). \n\nSeveral other advantages in the use of zeolites are reported particularly when compared to acidic \n\nion exchange resins, such as presenting higher selectivities in water; resistance to higher \n\ntemperatures favouring the formation of Hmf; capacity to adsorb organic acids partly responsible \n\nfor further degradation of Hmf; easier to regenerate by thermal processes.223 However various \n\nauthors reported that in the case of crystalline microporous solid acids as zeolites and zeotypes, \n\nthe formation of coke can lead to catalyst surface passivation and pore blockage, resulting in \n\ndecreasing catalytic activity and/or product selectivity.71,220,222,223,249 O\u2019Neill et al. 220 with H-ZSM-5 \n\nin the dehydration of D-xylose observed the formation of bulky by-products entrapped in the \n\nmicropores; Moreau et al.222,223 concluded that H-Mordenites or H-Faujasites with higher Si/Al \n\nratio lead to lower selectivities because upon increasing the Si/Al ratio, the acid properties of the \n\ncatalysts are decreased, and increases secondary reactions with formation of by-products; Kim et \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n50 \n \n\nal.249 observed the same behaviour for other zeolites. On the other hand, heavier substrate \n\nmolecules (e.g. di/polysaccharides) can be too bulky to enter the channels of the microporous \n\nstructures. The investigation of the microporous acid catalysts in the conversion of saccharides to \n\nFur/Hmf were followed by innovative applications of mesoporous materials possessing Br\u00f6nsted \n\nacid sites such as sulfonic acid groups (firstly tested by Dias et al.240 with MCM-41-SO3H, and \n\nfollowed by other authors with SBA-15-SO3H,\n257,352 sulfonic acid modified mesoporous shell silica \n\nbead, MSHS-SO3H,\n289 and propylthiol mesoporous silica SBA-15-SH,257 Table 1.6). Mesoporous \n\nmaterials possessing both Lewis acid sites and Br\u00f6nsted acid sites associated with the presence of \n\naluminium were also tested (amorphous SiO2-Al2O3,\n249,250,271,281,407 aluminium modified \n\nmesoporous  shell silica bead, Al-MSHS,289  aluminium-containing MCM-41 type,290,292,294,295,357 \n\nMCM-48 type,290 or crystalline mesoporous MCM-20 type,357 Table 1.6 ).Some zeolites are formed \n\nfrom lamellar precursors (e.g.  by thermal treatment) and these may be delaminated to form \n\nmesopores from aggregates, enhancing the specific surface area and acid sites accessibility (e.g. \n\nITQ-2,408,409 ITQ-6,410 ITQ-18,411,412 Nu-6413). These type of materials are quite promissing for the \n\nconversion of pentoses to Fur.265  \n\nSolid acids possessing sulfur-containing surface groups such as \n\n(per)sulfate229,245,255,293,296,298,367,370 and sulfonic acid240,257,289,346,352 have been successfully applied as \n\nacid catalysts in the reaction of saccharides to Hmf/Fur (Table 1.6). These types of materials \n\nshown in Table 1.6 are organic such as, ion-exchange resins  (e.g. Nafion,245 Nafion SAC-13,271,288 \n\nNafion-117,288 Nafion NR-50,229 (perfluorinate sulfonic acid resins) Amberlyst-15,35,229,240,243,245-\n\n247,260,274,407 Amberlyst-70,271,287,345,346,352 Amberlite IR-118,347 (macroreticular resin based on  a \n\nstyrene-divinylbenzene co-polymer) Diaion PK-216,18,347,348 Dowex 50wx4,253 Dowex 50wx8,259,348 \n\n(microreticular resin based on a styrene-divinylbenzene co-polymers) Lewatit S2328,351 Lewatit \n\nSCP 108,350 OH1052320), or others such as phosphonics arylsulfonic acid-functionalised non-\n\nordered silica (SiSphSA),352 thiopropyl groups onto non-porous silica (Tp-A380)346 and \n\npropylsulfonic acid groups on Tp-A380 (Taa-A380)346; inorganic such as, versions of (per)sulfate \n\nbulk (zirconia, titania, alumina or other metals) (e.g. S2O8\n2-/ZrO2,\n\n298 SO4\n2-/ZrO2,\n\n229,245,255,296,298,367,370 \n\nSO4\n2-/TiO2,\n\n255 SO4\n2-/Al2O3,\n\n255 SO4\n2-/Fe2O3,\n\n255 SO4\n2-/SnO2\n\n255 and SO4\n2-/HfO2\n\n255); alumina or silica-\n\nsupported (per)sulfate zirconia (e.g. S2O8\n2-/Al2O3-ZrO2, \n\n298  S2O8\n2-/ZrO2-MCM-41,\n\n298 S2O8\n2-/Al2O3-\n\nZrO2/MCM-41,\n298 SO4\n\n2-/Al2O3-ZrO2,\n293,298,370 SO4\n\n2-/ZrO2-Al2O3/SBA-15,\n293 SO4\n\n2-/ZrO2/SBA-15,\n293 SO4\n\n2-\n\n/ZrO2-MCM-41,\n298 and SO4\n\n2-/Al2O3-ZrO2/MCM-41\n298); hybrid organic-inorganic such as silicas \n\nmodified with sulfonic acid surface groups (e.g. MCM-41-SO3H,\n240,289 SBA-15-SO3H,\n\n257,352 HMS-\n\nSO3H,\n289 and sulfonic acid modified mesoporous shell silica bead, MSHS-SO3H\n\n289), thiopropyl \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n51 \n\n \n\ngroups (e.g. Tp-SBA-15346 and SBA-15-SH257) or with thiopropylsulfonic acid groups                      \n\n(e.g. Taa-SBA-15,346 3-((3-methoxysilyl)-propyl)thio)propane-1-sulfonic acid,TESAS-SBA-15,352       \n\n3-propylsulfonyl)propane-1-sulfonic acid, SSA-SBA-15352). SBA-15 in particular is a good suppot for \n\nthe dispersion of sulfated zirconia or sulfated groups because of its unique surface, pore \n\nstructure, and hydrothermal stabilities.414 These types of catalysts present some limitations in \n\nterms of thermal stability associated with the sulfur containing groups (SO4 \n2- groups are unstable \n\nat high temperatures (ca. 250 \u00b0C240,255) and catalyst regeneration requires a thermal treatment \n\nabove this temperature for the removal of the accumulated organic matter.240,293,370 Alternatives \n\nmight include regeneration with H2O2,\n240,257,293 or acetone.257 Another limitation is associated with \n\nleaching of sulfur-containing groups during the catalytic reaction.255,293,296,298 For example, for \n\nmaterials of the type (per)sulfated zirconia supported on mesoporous silica MCM-41 (some doped \n\nwith aluminium) used as catalysts in the dehydration of D-xylose, while no leaching of zirconium \n\nand aluminium was observed, the sulfur loading dropped by ca. 50%, compromising its \n\nreusability.298 Shi et al.257  observed coke formation in 34 wt.% for SBA-15-SO3H(C) (prepared by \n\nco-condensation) which lead to a deactivation of the catalyst. After regeneration with acetone the \n\ncontent of coke was still high (28.2 wt.%), which indicates that part of the accumulated organic \n\nmatter is not dissolved in acetone and the catalytic activity dropped by ca. 10%. However when \n\nregenerated with H2O2 the content of coke dropped almost completely (0.4 wt.%) and the \n\ncatalytic activity was recovered competely. These results indicate that H2O2 treatment is an \n\neffective method for regenerating sulfonic acid functionalised mesoporous SBA-15 materials. \n\nFurthermore no sulfur leaching was observed for SBA-15-SO3H(C) (S content was similar for the \n\nfresh and recovered catalysts) indicatiing that the material has a high thermal stability.257 MCM-\n\n41-SO3H resulted in a significant decrease in the Fur selectivity (65% to 23%) and CXyl (37% to 28%) \n\ndue to the formation of organic by-products (confirmed by colour change of the catalyst) which \n\nwere not efficiently eliminated by filtration and washing processes.289  The same behaviour was \n\npreviously noted by Dias et al.240 when the catalyst MCM-41-SO3H was washed with methanol and \n\ntreated with H2O2 (CXyl dropped from 62 to 52% and the Fur selectivity from 80% to 34%). On the \n\nother hand, despite the lower activity of HMS-SO3H, and MSHS-SO3H, the colour of the catalysts \n\nremained white after catalysis and no decrease in the selectivity was observed.289   \n\nThe substitution of sulfur groups by phosphorous has also been investigated in the \n\nreaction under study. Solid acids with phosphorous-containing surface groups such as versions of \n\ntitanium phosphates (e.g. ?-PO4\n2-/TiO2,\n\n239\n ?-PO4\n\n2-/TiO2\n239), zirconium phosphates (e.g. PO4\n\n2-/ \n\nZrO2,\n264,271,371 ?-PO4\n\n2-/ZrO2,\n239,407\n\n and Al2O3/PO4\n2-/ZrO2\n\n371), niobium phosphates (e.g. PO4\n2-\n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n52 \n \n\n/Nb2O5\n381), pyrophosphates (e.g. cubic zirconium pyrophosphate, C-ZrO2/P2O7,\n\n239\n cubic titanium \n\npyrophosphate C-TiP2O7\n239), metal-oxides with phosphoric acid (e.g. Ta2O5.nH2O/H3PO4\n\n2-,379 \n\nTiO2/H3PO4,\n365\n\n Nb2O5/H3PO4\n381) or yet layered vanadyl phosphates (VOP) involving both Br\u00f6nsted \n\nand Lewis acid sites were also tested, supported on silica, alumina, or titania (e.g.  VOP/SiO2,\n386 \n\nVOP/Al2O3,\n386 and VOP/TiO2\n\n386 ) and have been employed with good performances in both activity \n\nand selectivity (Table 1.6). The reuse of the phosphorous containing materials was possible after \n\nremoval of the adsorbed reaction by-products with acetone treatment, which allowed significant \n\nimprovement of the catalytic performances;239,381 or by treatment with a solution of H3PO4 \n\nwithout loss in the catalytic activity or selectivity for seven runs.264 No leaching was observed for \n\nphosphorous containing materials in aqueous media.271 Hybrid organic-inorganic materials with \n\nphosphorous tested in the dehydration of D-xylose are exemplified by rare earth hybrid layered \n\nnetworks formed by rare earth chloride salts and N-(carboxymethyl)iminodi(methylphosphoric \n\nacid).282 \n\nMesoporous silica-supported heteropolyacids (HPAs) of the Keggin-type, such as \n\nsupported HxPW12O40\n3-x 285 and CsxH3-xPW12O40,\n\n284 are quite active catalysts in the dehydration of \n\nD-xylose, although leaching of the active species was observed (using water and toluene (Wt/Tol) \n\nas a biphasic solvent system), resulting in a decrease of the catalytic activity and Fur yields in the \n\nsubsequent batch runs (Table 1.6). Using DMSO as solvent there was pratically no loss of \n\nactivity.284,285 The leaching phenomena is most likely related to relatively weak interactions of the \n\nactive species (ionic) with the support and solvation effects (when using the biphasic Wt/Tol \n\nsystem), leaving only Keggin anions strongly bound to the surface of the support.285 The \n\ncompound Ag3PW12O40 (as a Lewis acid) was tested in the conversion of D-fructose to Hmf, using \n\nwater/IBMK biphasic system as solvent, and was recycled for 6 batch runs without drop in \n\ncatalytic activity.  The leaching of Ag3PW12O40 was relatively low, ca. 5% (Table 1.6).\n315 A \n\nsulfonated organic heteropolyacid, [MimPS]3PW12O40, a heteropolyacid salt of an ionic liquid \n\ncation functionalised with a propanesulfonate group, 1-(3-sulfonicacid)propyl-3-methyl \n\nimidazolium phosphotungstate, was very efficient to convert D-fructose to Hmf presenting high \n\nstability without loss of activity during 6 recycling runs.362 \n\nCarbon-based catalysts (CBC) are hybrid organic-inorganic catalysts synthesised by \n\nincomplete carbonisation of high carbon content materials (e.g. sugars and naphthalene), that \n\nhave recently been used in biomass conversion and have the advantage of having a high thermal \n\nstability, high acidity, low preparation costs and high capacity of recyclability without significant \n\nlosses.246,256,354 Some examples of such catalysts include sulfonated napthalene-based catalyst \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n53 \n\n \n\n(SCBC),256 lignin-derived carbonaceous catalyst (LCC),354 and Glu-TsOH, a carbon-based catalyst \n\nprepared by a facile and eco-friendly approach from D-glucose and p-toluenesulfonic acid           \n\n(p-TsOH).246 These types of catalysts compare favourably to strong acidic sulfonated co-polymer \n\nresins which have low thermal stability (with temperatures below 130 \u00b0C) due to their organic \n\nframeworks.415 CBC have high thermal stability because of their carbon frameworks (Table 1.6).246  \n\nIn a recent work, Ordomsky et al.407 studied the acidity of some of the types of the \n\nmentioned materials (alumina, aluminosilicate, zirconium phosphate, niobic acid, ion-exchange \n\nresin Amberlyst-15 and zeolite Mordenite) using temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 \n\nand IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. In that work it was reported that the nature and \n\nstrength of acid sites plays a crucial role in the selectivity towards Hmf. While the Br\u00f6nsted acid \n\nsites in the case of zeolites and ion-exchange resin led to high selectivities in the dehydration of  \n\nD-fructose with an increase in the selectivity with the addition of IBMK, the Lewis acidity in the \n\ncase of phosphate and oxides results in the intensive production of humins from D-fructose at the \n\ninitial stages of the process, where organic phase addition did not affect selectivity.407 \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n54 \n \n\nTable 1.6- Catalytic results reported for the conversion of saccharides (and levoglucosan) to 2-furaldehyde (Fur) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde \n\n(Hmf) in the presence of insoluble solid acid catalysts. \n\nCsub\u2013 Substrate conversion in mol.%;  YFur- 2-furaldehyde yield in mol.%, YHmf- 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde yield in mol.%; \n\nAS= Acid sites, \u00b5mol.g-1; [B]= Concentration of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites, \u00b5mol.g-1; BS= Base sites, \u00b5mol.g-1; [L]= Concentration of Lewis acid sites, \u00b5mol.g-1, \n\nCO2-TPD- Acid properties measured by temperature programmed desorption of the adsorbed CO2, \n\nDp =Pore width (nm),  \n\nIR-NH3- Acid properties measured by infrared spectroscopy with ammonium as probe molecule, \n\nIR-py- Acid properties measured by infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine as probe molecule, \n\nITA- Intrinsic total acidity,  \u00b5.eq.g-1, \n\nNH3-TPD- temperature programmed desorption of the adsorbed ammonia.

Conversion of saccharides to furanic aldehydes using ionic liquid (IL) \n\nbased catalytic systems \n\n \n \n\nThe poor solubility of polysaccharides (especially that of cellulose, the most abundant \n\nsource of hexoses for Hmf) in almost any solvent may be a problem when considering the use of \n\nsolid acid catalysts due to the possible severe diffusion limitations. Some approaches prior to the \n\nreaction in the presence of a solid acid may be pre-treating the carbohydrate feedstock by pre-\n\ndissolution, which allows transforming the crystalline and recalcitrant cellulose structure (natural \n\nform) into an amorphous form that is faster hydrolysed than the crystalline form. This is \n\nimportant because the crystalline form is resistant to chemical and biological transformations (the \n\nglycosidic bonds are protected by the tight packing of cellulose chains in microfibrils). Many \n\nauthors have been making efforts to selectively convert saccharides into Hmf and Fur in ionic \n\nliquids (ILs) in order to enhance the solubility of the substrate in the reaction medium, improve \n\nyields of target products and facilitate catalyst recycling.403 \n\nILs were first introduced in 1914 by Paul Walden who reported the physical properties of \n\nethyl ammonium nitrate [EtNH3]NO3 formed by neutralisation of ethylamine with concentrated \n\nnitric acid.419 Nevertheless the earliest report on ILs applied to polysaccharides is only dated after \n\ntwo decades in a patent from 1934 focusing on the molten salt N-ethylpyridinium chloride that \n\ndissolved cellulose.420 In 1948 they emerged as mixtures of aluminium(III) chloride and                  \n\n1-ethylpyridinium bromide.421 Chemical and physical properties of derivatives of 1-\n\nbutylpyridinium tetrachloroaluminate ([Bpy]AlCl4) were found to have some limitations since it \n\nwas liquid at ambient temperature only within a very narrow composition range.422 Some years \n\nlater, 1-ethy-3-methylimidazolium tetracholoraluminate ([Emim]AlCl4) appeared with a much \n\nwider liquid range becoming the first IL system liquid at ambient temperature. Since then a wide \n\nnumber of potential applications of ILs as solvents in organic synthesis have been developed \n\nincorporating many different ions (Table 1.7).423  \n\n ILs are defined as a class of non-molecular ionic solvents consisting of ion pairs; an \n\norganic heterocyclic cation (e.g. dialkylimidazolium) and an inorganic (e.g. chloride or nitrate) or \n\norganic anion (e.g. trifluoromethane sulfonate or acetate) that usually melt at or below 100 \u00b0C. \n\nTheir versatility allows them to be referred to as \u201cdesigner solvents\u201d, because they may be \n\ntailored through the modification of the constituent ions to meet desired properties, such as \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n72 \n \n\npolarity, hydrophilicity, and miscibility with solutes or other solvents, and acid-base \n\nproperties.424,425 The cations in ILs are responsible for their physical properties (such as melting \n\npoint, viscosity and density) whereas the anions control chemical properties and reactivity.426  \n\nThe requirements of a certain solvent to dissolve cellulose are highly demanding such as: \n\ni) dissolution of cellulose (preferably more than 10 wt.%) at low temperature ; ii) melting point \n\nlower than 20 \u00b0C; iii) high thermal stability (> 200 \u00b0C); iv) non-volatile; v) non-toxic, vi) chemically \n\nstable; vii) no undesired cellulose decomposition; viii) easy recyclable process; ix) cost effective.16 \n\nCompared to common organic solvents used in carbohydrate chemistry, ILs have interesting \n\nproperties and different reviews describe their numerous advantages,403 besides they fulfill some \n\nof the \u201cGreen Chemistry\u201d requirements. They have almost no vapour pressure, avoiding \n\natmospheric pollution problems (emission and explosion risks) typically associated with volatile \n\norganic solvents and products contamination with the solvent in distillation processes. ILs remain \n\nliquid through a wide range of temperatures and are quite stable at high temperatures. They are \n\nfairly air- and water-stable (water is intrinsically associated with the hydrolysis/dehydration \n\nprocesses), and in some cases they can be recycled efficiently. ILs also have relatively moderate \n\nsurface tensions compared to organic solvents and even when compared to water.427 ILs display \n\nsingular solubilisation properties for cellulose (and other polysaccharides), as  the dissolution of \n\nthe latter in ILs, breaks down crystalline domains leaving the polysaccharide chains more exposed \n\nand the glycosidic bonds more accessible to active species.428-430 In the specific case of [Bmim]Cl, \n\nan NMR study demonstrated that the solubility of cellulose is due to the disruption of the \n\nhydrogen bonds in cellulose by the chloride anions of the IL.431 Hence, through the use of ILs it is \n\npossible to affect the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers commonly associated with the \n\ntransformation of the polysaccharides in water or common organic solvents.428-430,432 Therefore ILs \n\nopen up a window of opportunities for the dissolution of carbohydrates and their ability to \n\ndissolve cellulose is dependent on the degree of polymerisation (DOP), its crystallinity, and on the \n\noperating conditions.234 \n\nThe most effective ILs for dissolving cellulose or cellulosic biomass have included those \n\ncomposed of imidazolium or pyridinium cations with short aliphatic chain substituent groups and \n\nanions, which are strong hydrogen bond acceptors, such as chloride and acetate, for disrupting \n\nthe extensive hydrogen bond network of cellulose (Table 1.7).184,420,426,428-430,433-448 The efficiency of \n\nthe IL-based reaction system may be further improved through the use of MW heating (in bulk \n\nheating), instead of conventional heating (CH, using an external heating source involving \n\nconduction/convection),343,449,450 since the dielectric properties of ILs allow the MW absorption in \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n73 \n\n \n\nbulk heating to be extremely efficient.334,451,452 However, apart from the advantages mentioned, \n\none of the disadvantages they present is related to their viscosity being relatively high compared \n\nto conventional solvents (66 to 1110 cP at 20-25 \u00b0C), and hence the design of less viscous ILs is still \n\na challenge for many applications.453 \n\nTwo main approaches have been successfully used as tools in different perspectives \n\nregarding the application of ILs in the acid-catalysed hydrolysis/dehydration of saccharides to Fur \n\nand Hmf, under mild reaction conditions: i) ILs as solvents (an acid catalyst is added) or ii) acid \n\nsolvents/catalysts (dual function).  Ideally, the IL dissolves the substrate (and the catalyst when \n\nthe IL is not acidic) but not the target products, simplifying the product separation process and \n\navoiding product and/or catalyst loss/decomposition in more laborous/demanding work-up \n\nprocedures. Accordingly, in the case of Fur production, the product separation is possible by \n\ndecantation, and in the case of Hmf (solid) by filtration. However, Fur and Hmf are soluble in the \n\nIL systems which have been investigated (Tables 1.7 and 1.8). When the target products are \n\nsoluble in the IL, it may be beneficial to use a co-solvent for in situ extraction of those products as \n\nthey are formed (a biphasic liquid-liquid system). Nevertheless, the addition of a co-solvent may \n\ncause cross-contamination requiring additional purification steps (Table 1.8). In the case of Fur \n\nproduction, a cleaner approach may be to evaporate the product as it is formed.  \n\nHigh expectations on ILs for these reaction systems are evident and have already \n\ndeserved patent applications.194,454-457 A review about the use of imidazolium salts in the \n\nconversion of biomass was published in 2010.184 More recently Zakrzewska et al.458 focused \n\nspecifically on Hmf production by means of the IL-mediated conversion of hexoses or related \n\ndi/polysaccharides and summarised studies published until July 2010. A minireview by St\u00e4hlberg \n\net al.459 has focused on issues of process technology of the synthesis of Hmf using ILs, and a \n\nreview by A. Rosatella et al.185 addresses the toxicological and environmental impact issues \n\nregarding the preparation of Hmf, which includes ILs as solvents. A recent review about ILs used in \n\nthe hydrolysis/dehydration reaction of saccharides (pentoses or hexoses) into furanic aldehydes \n\nwas published.4 The research and development of IL-based catalytic systems for the chemical \n\nvalorisation of (highly complex) biomass can be made by looking at how each type of IL-based \n\ncatalytic system performed for different  types of carbohydrates (containing pentoses and \n\nhexoses). The latter approach has good prospects to convert different saccharides into Fur+Hmf \n\n(including stability and recycling efficiency) which are desirable for process intensification.  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n74 \n \n\nSeveral published works have focused on a specific substrate, which leaves gaps in the \n\nknowledge of the potential of the investigated IL-based catalytic systems for converting different \n\ncarbohydrate feedstocks.  \n\nIn the following Sections IL-mediated production of Fur and Hmf from biomass is \n\nsummarised, in the perspective of the type of IL-based catalytic system (IL as solvents coupled \n\nwith a Br\u00f6nsted or Lewis acid catalyst or acidic ILs working as solvents and catalysts), crossing \n\ninformation of different scientific contributions having in common the application of a specific \n\ntype of IL-based catalytic system, and promising achievements in the reactions of different \n\nmono/di/polysaccharides are reported. Comparisons of product selectivity should only be made \n\nfor similar saccharide (or saccharide conversions). Since this was often not possible between \n\ndifferent works, the results are focused in terms of Hmf and Fur molar yields (denoted Y, equation \n\n1.5) and in terms of molar conversions of saccharides (denoted Csaccharide, equation 1.6): no \n\n(saccharide), nt (saccharide) and nt (Fur or Hmf) are the initial moles of saccharide, the moles of \n\nsaccharide, Fur or Hmf at a reaction time t, respectively.

ILs as solvents (an acid catalyst is added) \n\n \n\n \n\nWhen ILs are used as solvents in the conversion of polysaccharides into furanic \n\ncompounds, the catalysts used are Lewis acids (e.g. transition metal salts) or Br\u00f6nsted acids \n\n(mineral acids, heteropolyacids and organic acids). The investigated ILs were essentially those \n\ncontaining an alkyl or allyl-substituted imidazolium cation and a halide anion, which have \n\ninteresting solubilisation properties for saccharides and are readily available (Table 1.8).

ILs coupled with homogeneous liquid acid catalysts \n\n \n\n \n\nA range of liquid Br\u00f6nsted acid catalysts have been tested using ILs as solvents in the \n\nreaction of monosaccharides, mainly D-fructose (Figures 1.25 and 1.27) and D-glucose (Figure \n\n1.28) or polysaccharides (e.g. cellulose, Figure 1.29). The liquid Br\u00f6nsted acid catalysts mostly \n\nused include inorganic HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, H3PO4 mineral acids (Figure 1.25)\n196,198,230,306,317,334,463 or \n\norganic acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, and maleic acids (Figures 1.27 and 1.28).198,202,306,316,463,464  \n\nVarious ILs used as solvents with mineral acids as catalysts in the dehydration of monosaccharides \n\n(D-xylose, D-fructose or D-glucose), can be employed with or without a co-solvent at reaction \n\ntemperatures in the range of 80-120 \u00b0C, reaction times from 1 min to 12 h and using MW or \n\nconventional heating (CH) methods.196,198,231,306 In the case of Hmf production from D-fructose    \n\n(4-10 wt.%), high (80-95%) YHmf were obtained, using H2SO4 as catalyst coupled with different ILs \n\n([Emim]Cl, [Hpy]Cl or [Bmim]Cl at 80-120 \u00b0C (Figure 1.25).196,231,306,338,353,463  These results showed \n\nthe positive effect of sulfuric acid (no Hmf was formed in the absence of the catalyst).338  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.25- Mineral acids used as catalysts coupled with ILs as solvents in the dehydration of      \n\nD-fructose to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf). \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n79 \n\n \n\n  In [Hxmim]Cl and [Omim]Cl, the H2SO4 (10 mol.%) had no catalytic effect (YHmf &lt;10%) due \n\nto the bulky groups that prevent the H+ of the acid to react with D-fructose. However, increasing \n\nthe content of H2SO4 to 25 mol.% facilitated the contact of the H\n+ ions with D-fructose, reaching \n\n82% YHmf in the case of [Hxmim]Cl  (Figure 1.25).\n338  \n\nIt was postulated that the anion Cl- played an important role in the enolisation step, acting \n\nas nucleophile and attacking a fructofuranosyl oxocarbenium ion (primary intermediate) to form a \n\n2-deoxy-2-halo intermediate that is less prone to side reactions, as well as reversion to                 \n\nD-fructose; the latter intermediate then loses HCl to form the enol intermediate (Figure 1.26).196 \n\n \n\nHO\n\nHO\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nOH\n\n1\n\nH+\n\nH2O\n\nHO\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nOH\n\n1\n\nHO\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nNucleophile X\n-\n\nX\n\nHX-\n\nHO\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nX-\n\nbase O\nHO\n\nO\n\nH\n\nOH OH\n\n \n\nFigure 1.26- Putative nucleophilic mechanism for halide participation in the dehydration of           \n\nD-fructose into 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf);  X- represents a halide ion [adapted from \n\n196]. \n\n \n\n \n\nUsing HNO3 resulted in a higher Hmf yield than that with H3PO4 possibly due to the \n\nstronger acidity of the former (based on pKa values for aqueous solutions) although this trend \n\nmay not necessarily be in line with that for ILs as solvents.198 The use of HCl as catalyst in ILs is \n\nalso very effectve for Hmf production from D-fructose (Figure 1.25). For a series of self-made ILs \n\ncontaining imidazolium or pyridinium cations and using HCl as catalyst (9 mol.%), Li et al.463 \n\nreported far better results for the halide (Cl- or Br-)-containing ILs than for BF4\n- and PF6\n\n-. In line \n\nwith this trend, better results were also found for [Emim]Cl in comparison to [Emim]BF4 for the \n\n[H2SO4/IL/DMA] system.\n196 The superior results for the Cl- containing IL compared to the \n\n\u201cnonbasic\u201d (poor coordination ability) BF4\n- and PF6\n\n- containing ILs, may be partly related to the \n\nlower affinity of the latter ILs towards D-fructose or cationic intermediates, in comparison to the \n\nCl-containing IL.196,311,430,465-467 On the other hand, the stability of HCl may be influenced by the \n\ntype of the IL (possibly more stable in Cl-containing ILs). The HCl/[Bmim]Cl system was effective \n\neven for D-fructose loadings as high as 50 wt.% (67% YHmf (78% CFru) at 80 \u00b0C/55 min).\n463 These \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n80 \n \n\nresults are promising in comparison to those for the aqueous phase reaction of D-fructose at 80-\n\n95 \u00b0C, in the presence of HCl (>0.25 M) or acid resins (e.g. 20% YHmf after several h).\n226 The use of \n\nhigh concentrations of HCl may allow high YHmf to be reached at lower reaction temperatures and \n\nlonger reaction times. Lai et al.432 for the reaction of D-fructose (20 wt.%) in HCl/[Bmim]Cl, with a \n\nHCl loading of 50 mol.%, achieved a 80% YHmf at a.t./70 h. The addiiton of tetrahydrofuran (THF) as \n\nimmiscible co-solvent to the system HCl/[Bmim]Cl enhanced the reaction rate and gave \n\ncomparable Hmf yields in only 24 h). Furthermore the IL was recycled in an efficient way (Section \n\n1.5.3).432 The use of IL-based systems instead of conventional acidic aqueous solutions (typically \n\ninvolving high temperatures) avoid Hmf loss reactions via its decomposition into formic and \n\nlevulinic acids.201 The influence of water in the IL system on the reaction of D-fructose was \n\ninvestigated in detail for the HCl/[Bmim]Cl system at 80 \u00b0C, and it was found that the reaction rate \n\ndecreased with increasing water concentration (up to ca. 30 wt.%). Nevertheless, increasing \n\nreaction times allowed similarly high Hmf yield to be reached.463 Although mineral acids have \n\nbeen used with success, Li et al.321 obtained a high  Hmf yield without using a catalyst under MW. \n\nAt 240 W the dehydration of  D-fructose (50 wt.%) gave 98% YHmf at  80 \u00b0C/6 min; at 400 W the \n\nsame YHmf was reached at 155 \u00b0C in only 1 min. At a potency higher than 400 W, a fast D-fructose \n\nconsumption  (> 90% in 30 s) was observed, but a lower YHmf (80% in 20 s).\n321 In an oil bath and \n\nsolely [Bmim]Cl (9 wt.% D-fructose) an inferior 82% YHmf (84% CFru) was obtained at 155 \u00b0C/5 min. \n\nThe addition of  5 mol.% of HCl to [Bmim]Cl gave 92% YHmf (96% CFru) at 100 \u00b0C/30 min. Using H2O \n\n(instead of [Bmim]Cl) with 1 mol.% HCl gave a much lower YHmf of only 11% (39% CFru) at 100 \n\n\u00b0C/420 min.321 This proved that [Bmim]Cl played an important role in promoting the reaction, and \n\nthe combination with MW produced great benefits for the selective dehydration of D-fructose.321   \n\n \n\nOrganic acids have as well been sucessfully coupled with ILs as solvents for the conversion \n\nof saccharides into furanic aldehydes under moderate reaction conditions (Figure 1.27); they are \n\nmore attractive in comparison to inorganic acids in that they may be obtained from renewable \n\nbiomass and may be biodegradable. For example, the reaction of D-fructose (10 wt.%) in the \n\npresence of maleic acid (7.6 mol.%) in [Bmim]Cl gave 88% YHmf at 80 \u00b0C/50 min, which is similar to \n\nthe best results reported for inorganic liquid acids (Figures 1.25 and 1.27).463 CF3SO3H in [Bmim]Cl \n\nprovided better YHmf  (88% at 96% CFru) than H2SO4 (ca. 85% YHmf) or CuCl2 (ca. 80% YHmf) due to the \n\nstronger proton donor ability it presents.303  In the absence of a catalyst, the YHmf was only 48% \n\nindicating the excellent synergistic effect of the catalyst. The authors reported equally high YHmf \n\n(ca. 90%) for imidazolium cations with alkyl chain substituent groups of less than four carbon \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n81 \n\n \n\natoms ([Mim]Cl, [Emim]Cl, [Bmim]Cl). Longer alkyl chains prevent the H of C-2 of the imidazolium \n\ncation to contact with the -OH group of D-fructose to dehydrate into Hmf (YHmf &lt;15% with \n\n[Hxmim]Cl, [Omim]Cl and [Dmim]Cl).303 Varying the anion to [Bmim]BF4, [Bmim]PF6, \n\n[Bmim]CF3SO3H or [Bmim]SCN also gave very poor YHmf(&lt;20%). Molecular simulation studies \n\nindicated that the Cl- anion has a stronger interaction with D-fructose. The Cl- ions in ILs may tend \n\nto form strong hydrogen bonds between two adjacent -OH groups in D-fructose (OH-Cl-OH).303 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.27- Homogeneous organic Br\u00f6nsted acids coupled with ILs as solvents in the dehydration \n\nof D-fructose to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf).  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe results reported to date using liquid Br\u00f6nsted acid catalysts in ILs as solvents in the \n\nreaction of D-fructose to Hmf (Figures 1.25 and 1.27) are, in general, more attractive than those \n\nfor D-glucose (Figure 1.28). The reaction of D-fructose (10 wt.%) in [Emim]Cl, without adding an \n\nacid, gave ca. 40% YHmf (58% CFru) and 70% YHmf (100% CFru) at 100 \u00b0C and 120 \u00b0C, respectively, after \n\n3 h reaction. The same IL was ineffective in converting D-glucose into Hmf (YHmf&lt;5%, even at the \n\nhigher temperature of 180 \u00b0C).201 Hence, D-glucose is a more demanding substrate than                \n\nD-fructose for Hmf production. Nevertheless, for the reaction of D-glucose, considerably higher \n\nYHmf have been reported using Br\u00f6nsted acid catalyst/IL systems (Figure 1.28) in comparison to \n\nacidic ILs (discussed in Section 1.5.2), possibly due to the stronger bulk acidity in the latter case. \n\nDifferent inorganic (H2SO4, HNO3, HCl, H3PO4) and organic (CH3SO3H, CF3SO3H) liquid acids have \n\nbeen tested in the conversion of D-glucose, using [Bmim]Cl as solvent (Figure 1.28).198,230,231,317,334 \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n82 \n \n\n \nFigure 1.28- Br\u00f6nsted liquid acid catalysts coupled with ILs as solvents in the dehydration of          \n\nD-glucose (Glu) to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehye (Hmf).198 Reaction conditions: 9 wt.% sac, 1 \n\nmol.% cat, T=120 \u00b0C, reaction time= 3 h. \n\n \n\n \n\nD-Sucrose,230 starch,322 cellulose317 and other biomass derived feedstocks have been \n\nconverted into 30-60% YHmf, using HCl in imidazolium chloride ILs (Table 1.8).

Some are soluble (such as beta\u00edne \n\nhydrochloride,356 Keggin type heteropolyacids,198 or metal chloride salts),196,201,305,306,309,313,322-324,328-\n\n332,334-339,373,374,468-472 while others are insoluble (such as organic ion-exchange acid \n\nresins,302,304,306,309,311,343 carbon-based catalysts,354 microporous zeolites,309,313zirconium \n\noxides,364,369 sulfated zirconia,364 other inorganic oxides (P2O5 and B2O5),\n325 or hybrid organic-\n\ninorganic, like SBA-15-SO3H \n353). \n\nBeta\u00edne hydrochloride-based catalyst (denoted BHC), a co-product of the sugar beet \n\nindustry coupled to [Cho]Cl (Choline chloride), gave interesting results as a homogeneous acid \n\ncatalyst in the dehydration of D-fructose to Hmf (Figure 1.30).356 The homogeneous system \n\n([Cho]Cl/BHC/H2O), with a mass ratio of [10/0.5/2] (5 wt.% BHC, 10 wt.% D-fructose), reached \n\n81% YHmf at 110 \u00b0C/1 h. With the addition of IBMK, a slightly improved 84% YHmf was obtained \n\nunder the same conditions (Figure 1.30).356 [Cho]Cl was beneficial for the production of Hmf as in \n\nits absence lower YHmf were obtained. For the system [glycerol/BHC] with a mass ratio of [50:50] \n\nand [H2O/IBMK/BHC], in 2 h the YHmf was 57% at 110 \u00b0C. Hmf is less reactive with [Cho]Cl than \n\nwith glycerol or H2O.\n356 The efficiency of the ([Cho]Cl/BHC/H2O) system also depended on the       \n\nD-fructose and BHC contents. Higher amounts of D-fructose and BHC resulted in a lower 50% YHmf \n\n(40 wt.% fructose, 10 wt.% BHC). Higher concentrations of D-fructose led to degradation of Hmf \n\nto soluble and insoluble humins; BHC amounts > 5 wt.% limit the reaction due to diffusion \n\nproblems caused by the high viscosity of the system.356 This system was especially successful for \n\nD-fructose. For D-glucose the presence of AlCl3 (10 mol.%) is required to promote the \n\nisomerisation into D-fructose, reaching 40% YHmf (temperature and time not mentioned). \n\nRecycling tests in order to recover the IL were applied with success (Section 1.5.3).356 A BHC \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n84 \n \n\nhomogeneous catalyst (5 wt.%) coupled to ([Cho]Cl/H2O/IBMK) was also applied in the conversion \n\nof inulin (15 wt.%), giving a  YHmf  of 19 wt.% (52 mol.%) at 100 \u00b0C/1h (Table 1.8, Figure 1.33).\n356  \n\n \n\n Heteropolyacids (HPAs) are easier and safer to handle than liquid acids; HPAs of the \n\nkeggin-type gave comparable or superior results to those observed for liquid acid catalysts in the \n\nreaction of D-glucose using imidazolium-chloride ILs as solvents (Figure 1.30).198 The trend in \n\ncatalytic activity in the reaction of D-glucose (9 wt.%) in HPA/[Bmim]Cl at 120 \u00b0C/3 h correlated \n\nwith the trend in the acidity of the HPA: 12-TPA>12-MPA>12-TSA>12-MSA; 12-TPA=12-\n\ntungstophosphoric acid (H3PW12O40); 12-MPA=12-molybdophosphoric acid (H3PMo12O40,); 12-\n\nTSA=12-tungstosilicic acid (H3SiW12O40); 12-MSA=molybdosilicic acid (H3SiMo12O40) (Figure \n\n1.30).198  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.30- Soluble organic solid acids coupled with ILs in the dehydration of D-fructose or          \n\nD-glucose (Glu) into 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf).  \n\n \n\n \n\nWith 12-MPA as catalyst, the ILs [Bm2im]Cl and [BmPy]Cl were less effective solvents than \n\n[Bmim]Cl and it was postulated that these differences could be due to differences in the acid-base \n\nproperties of the IL medium.198 The formation of humins in the reaction of D-glucose (9 wt.%) \n\ncould be suppressed by coupling the HPA/IL system with acetonitrile as co-solvent (ca. 40 wt.% in \n\nthe IL), giving an outstanding result of 98% YHmf (99% CGlu) in the case of 12-MPA/([Bmim]Cl or \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n85 \n\n \n\n[Emim]Cl) at 120 \u00b0C/3 h.198 Besides decreasing the viscosity of the IL, which may improve mass \n\ntransfer rates, acetonitrile may have an effect of leveling-off the acid strength of the reaction \n\nmedium.198,343,449,450 On the other hand, non-protic solvents, such as acetonitrile and DMSO, may \n\ninfluence the equilibrium of mutarotation of hexoses (water concentration in the system may also \n\ninfluence the extent of this process) which may affect the selectivity of the catalytic \n\nsystem.226,473,474   \n\n \n\nSeveral transition metal and lanthanide chloride salts as catalysts dissolved in ILs, mainly \n\n1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, were investigated in the conversion of saccharides into \n\nHmf, especially for D-fructose (Figure 1.31).196,201,202,230,306,322,328,330,331,334,336,374,455,457,468,470,471,475 In \n\nthe case of D-glucose dehydration almost no catalyst besides chromium chloride (CrCl2) was \n\neffective (Figure 1.32).196,201,230,322,330,334,336,374,455,457,468,470,471,475 Zhao et al.201 patented the \n\napplication of such processes, and some of these represented major breakthroughs in the \n\nselective conversion of D-glucose (Figure 1.32) and related di/polysaccharides into Hmf (Figure \n\n1.34).194,201,329 YHmf values in the range 59-83% have been reported for the reaction of D-fructose \n\n(10 wt.%) using metal Lewis catalysts in [Emim]Cl at (80-120 \u00b0C)/(1.5-3h) (Figure 1.31).196,201,470,471 \n\nChromium salts were the most used. By MW heating  Qi et al.336 obtained 78% YHmf from D-\n\nfructose (5 wt.%) at 100 \u00b0C within only 1 min by using CrCl3/[Bmim]Cl (10 mol.% salt; IL with less \n\nthan 1% H2O, Figure 1.31); good results were obained in recycling runs (Section 1.5.3). Yong et \n\nal.330 tested the CrCl2/[Bmim]Cl system in the presence of a bulky N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), \n\nnamely 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolylidene (Ipr), and obtained 96% YHmf at 100 \u00b0C/6 h (9 \n\nmol.% catalyst, 10 wt.% D-fructose and CH method, Figure 1.31). NHC ligands are interesting \n\nbecause they offer a great deal of flexibility as the catalytic activity can be modified by varying \n\ntheir stereo and electronic properties.330 In this study, the authors concluded that bulky NHC \n\nligands such as Ipr inhibit the Cr centre from reacting with [Bmim]Cl to form a sterically crowded \n\nmetal centre, thereby providing a higher catalytic efficiency since the initiation of the reaction by \n\nbinding of the substrate to the metal centre will be inhibited if the centre is sterically crowded.330  \n\nThe stability of the IL was confirmed by recyling procedures (Section 1.5.3). Using DMSO instead \n\nof IL drastically decreased the YHmf to 41%.\n330,455,457,468 \n\nGood results were obtained with ([Bmim]Cl/CrCl3.6H2O) and ([Bmim]Cl/CrCl2; 6 mol.% \n\ncatalyst and 10 wt.% D-fructose): 80 and 60% YHmf respectively (100% CFru) at  80 \u00b0C/3 h.\n331 The \n\nhigher catalytic activity of Cr3+ is due to the increased Lewis acidity compared to Cr2+, which limits \n\nthe concentration of intermediates that are prone to bimolecular condensation reactions that \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n86 \n \n\nlead to humins.331 Other ILs were tested instead of [Bmim]Cl: [Bemim]Cl and [Bmim]TolSO3 \n\nreached 71% and 66% YHmf, respectively, at 100 \u00b0C/2 h; [Hxmim]Cl and [Bdmim]Cl (44-49% YHmf at \n\n90-92% CFru); [Omim]Cl gave a very poor YHmf (&lt;1%).\n338 These results are in agreement with the \n\ndiscussion in \u201cthe ILs coupled to Br\u00f6nsted catalysts Section\u201d, in that the catalytic activity \n\ndecreases with the length of the alkyl group.303,338 The anions of ILs used also play a role in the    \n\nD-fructose dehydration: the interaction of the acidic H+ in [Bmim]TolSO3 with D-fructose is more \n\ndifficult than in [Bmim]Cl, and Cl- acts as nucleophile promoting the reaction in a more favourable \n\nway than the p-toluenesulfonate anion.338  \n\nGruber et al.194 reported lower yields when the CrCl2/IL system contained acetic or \n\npropanoic acids as co-solvents (10 wt.% D-fructose; 6 mol.% catalyst; IL=([Emim]Cl+[Hmim]Cl);   \n\n29 or 40% YHmf were obtained respectively. However, the main products formed were                    \n\n5-(acetoxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde or 5-(propionyloxy)methyl-2-furaldehyde, respectively, which \n\nare promising fuels/fuel additives.  \n\nDespite their contribution to important mechanistic insights, in the chromium-based \n\ncatalytic processes, Cr6+ can be formed, posing serious risks to humam health and the \n\nenvironment, which would mean that their implementation on an industrial scale would be \n\nsubject to very stringent regulations. Therefore several other different inorganic chloride salts \n\nhave been tested. Zhao et al.201 reported 63-83% YHmf for FeCl2, FeCl3, CuCl, CuCl2, VCl3, MoCl3, \n\nPdCl2, PtCl2, PtCl4, RuCl3, RhCl3, AlCl3 as catalysts (6 mol.%), using [Emim]Cl as solvent at 80 \u00b0C/3 h \n\n(10 wt.% D-fructose, Figure 1.31). The best result was obtained for PtCl2.\n201 Using H2SO4 as catalyst \n\n(1.8-18 mol.%) instead of a metal Lewis acid, under similar reaction conditions, gave similar 75-\n\n80% YHmf.\n201 Other inorganic chloride salts (SnCl4, BiCl3, ScCl3 and CeCl3 in 10 mol.%) resulted in \n\nYHmf less than 8% with [Bmim]Cl at 100 \u00b0C/5 min (5 wt.% D-fructose).\n373 However, using SnCl4 (10 \n\nmol.%) coupled to [Emim]BF4, Hu et al.\n374 reported 62% YHmf (100% CFru) for the reaction of D-\n\nfructose (20 wt.%) at 100 \u00b0C/3 h; compared to chromium chloride catalysts, SnCl4 has lower \n\ntoxicity and in what concerns recycling tests it was successful too.374 \n\n \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n87 \n\n \n\n   \nFigure 1.31- Lewis acid catalysts coupled with ILs as solvents in the dehydration of D-fructose to  \n\n5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf);  Ipr=1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolylidene.  \n\n  \n\n \n\nUsing GeCl4  (10 mol.% based on 3.3. wt.% D-fructose), [Bmim]Cl under very mild reaction \n\nconditions and DMSO (50 wt.% to the IL) as co-solvent, Zhang et al.469 obtained 70% YHmf at          \n\n25 \u00b0C/12 h (Figure 1.31). In the absence of the IL the YHmf was only 39% within 12 h, which proved \n\nthat the IL promotes the dehydration reaction; and are relatively easy to recover for further reuse \n\n(recycling tests in Section 1.5.3).469 However, not all ILs, under the same conditions, are promising \n\nfor this type of reaction: with [Bmim]CH3COO, the YHmf  was &lt;5%, possibly due to side reactions \n\nbetween D-fructose and the imidazolim ring induced by the strongly basic acetate group. In the \n\ncase of [Bmim]BF6, the low nucleophilicity of BF6\n- compared to Cl- might hamper the D-fructose \n\ndehydration, leading to a lower 25% YHmf.\n469 In the case of the salts RuCl3, WCl4 and WCl6, 45-63% \n\nYHmf were reached under very mild reaction conditions (at 50 \u00b0C/4 h). The best results were \n\nobserved for the tungsten-containing systems.328 This was a very good result when compared to \n\nchromium chloride (CrCl2 or CrCl3) which gave YHmf&lt;5%.\n328 In the case of WCl6, the 63% YHmf at     \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n88 \n \n\n80 \u00b0C was slightly lower than that at 50 \u00b0C (ca. 62% YHmf), which encouraged the authors to test \n\nlower temperatures (42% YHmf at 22 \u00b0C/4 h and 53% YHmf at 30 \u00b0C/4 h).\n328 Coupling the \n\nWCl6/[Bmim]Cl system (10 mol.% salt) with THF as immiscible co-solvent for the in situ extraction \n\nof Hmf gave 72% YHmf compared to 63% YHmf for the monophasic solvent system at 50 \u00b0C/4 h      \n\n(20 wt.% D-fructose), meaning that THF was able to remove the water produced during the \n\ndehydration step. THF gave better results than IBMK, Tol, or ethyl acetate as co-solvents.328,455 The \n\nWCl6/[Bmim]Cl/THF biphasic solvent system could be operated in a batch, semi-batch, or \n\ncontinuous mode. The latter produced superior Hmf yield due to a continuous extraction of the \n\nHmf phase, allowing the IL purification (by water removal). Further details on the recycling \n\nprocedures are described in Section 1.5.3.328,455   \n\nOther type of ILs, without imidazolium cations, were reported by Cao et al.,323 and Hmf \n\nyields in the range 64 to 81% YHmf (100% CFru) were obtained with the ILs [M4N]Cl, [E4N]Cl, [B4N]Cl, \n\n[M3BeN]Cl, [M3PhN]Cl, [M3HN]Cl, [M2H2N]Cl  and [Cho]Cl from D-fructose (50 wt.%) at 120 \u00b0C/     \n\n70 min, 323 in which the best result was obtained with [E4N]Cl (recycling tests in Section 1.5.3).\n323 \n\nHowever at 100 \u00b0C, only 33% YHmf was achieved by [E4N]Cl. To improve this result, a Lewis acid co-\n\ncatalyst (10 mol.% CrCl3.6H2O, FeCl3, CuCl2.2H2O, MoCl3, AlCl3) or NaHSO4.H2O was added, which  \n\nled to an improvement in the YHmf to 68-83% (100% CFru) at 100 \u00b0C/70 min.\n323 These results are \n\ncomparable with the results obtained by Zhao et al.201 with [Emim]Cl,  although Cao et al.323 used \n\na higher concentration of D-fructose (50 wt.% compared to 10 wt.%) which seems to be preferred \n\nin Hmf production processes.  \n\nFor the more demanding substrate D-glucose, catalytic systems of the type \n\nMClx/(imidazolium), with M=chromium or tin, gave more than 60% YHmf (Figure \n\n1.32).196,201,230,322,330,334,336,374,455,457,468,470,471,475  \n\nOutstanding results were reported in a pioneering work by Zhao et al.201 using various \n\nmetal chlorides as catalysts (9 mol.% based on D-glucose) for the catalytic conversion of D-glucose \n\n(10 wt.%) in [Emim]Cl, in which CrCl2 was found to be the best catalyst giving nearly 70% YHmf  \n\n(90% CGlu) at 100 \u00b0C/3 h. This proves that CrCl2 improves the YHmf, as when using [Emim]Cl in the \n\nabsence of catalyst, no Hmf was formed and the CGlu was only 40%, and when using H2SO4 instead \n\nof CrCl2 very poor results were achieved (ca. 12% YHmf at 95% CGlu, Figure 1.32).\n201  Binder et al. 196 \n\nadded LiCl to this system and reported that it did not affect the yield of Hmf, while the absence of \n\nCrCl2, led to a YHmf less than 1%,\n196 similar to that reported by Zhao for LiCl/[Emim]Cl.201 Zhang et \n\nal.331 reported 55% YHmf (ca. 90% CGlu) and 58% YHmf (ca. 90% CGlu) with CrCl2 and CrCl3, \n\nrespectively, instead of CrCl3.6H2O. These results indicate that CrCl3.6H2O is more active in the \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n89 \n\n \n\nisomerisation of D-glucose to D-fructose and in the dehydration of D-fructose. The difference in \n\nthe Hmf yield between CrCl3 and CrCl3.6H2O might also be related to their different solubilities in \n\n[Emim]Cl which is related to their solid state structure. The dissolution in [Emim]Cl implies the \n\nintroduction of the Cl- of the IL in the coordination sphere of chromium.331 This process is difficult \n\nfor CrCl3 because it involves a substantial perturbation of the octahedrally coordinated chromium \n\nions (of its Cl-bridged octahedral CrCl6 network), and there is not an energy benefit from the \n\nsubstitution of a bridging Cl ligand by a terminal one, which makes CrCl3 insoluble in [Emim]Cl in \n\nthe absence of D-glucose. However, solubility tests suggested that a carbonyl moiety is necessary \n\nto favour CrCl3 dissolution; therefore the presence of D-glucose provides a slow dissolution.\n331 On \n\nthe other hand, in CrCl3.6H2O, the Cr\n3+ centers are present as isolated hexa aquo-chromium \n\ncations (Cr-OH2) interconnected through a hydrogen-bonding network between Cl\n\u2013 anions and \n\nH2O ligands which rapidly decomposes in highly polar [Emim]Cl.\n331  Using other ILs, such as \n\n[Bmim]Cl, [Hxmim]Cl, [Bdmim]Cl, [Bemim]Cl and [Bmim]TolSO3, with CrCl3.6H2O (25 mol.% based \n\non 10 wt.% D-fructose), YHmf (55-65%) were obtained at 120 \u00b0C/1 h.\n338 Several other chloride salts \n\nconsisted of Na, Li, La, Al, Mn, Fe, Cu, V, Mo, Pd, Pt, Ru or Rh were tested in [Emim]Cl, but failed \n\nto succeed (YHmf was always less than 10%), because in general, they catalysed undesired reaction \n\npathways or D-glucose conversion was negligible (which was the case with La3+, Na+, Li +, Mn3+, \n\nCu2+).201 YHmf &lt;8% (50-70% CGlu) were also reported with the system IrCl3/[Bmim]Cl (7 mol.%  \n\ncatalyst; 10 wt.% D-glucose).324 St\u00e5hlberg et al.391 explored lanthanide salts (CeCl3, PrCl3, NdCl3, \n\nDyCl3, YbCl3, Yb(CF3SO3)3 (10 mol.%) with IL=[Bmim]Cl or [Emim]Cl but the YHmf were less than 24% \n\nat 140 \u00b0C/6 h (10 wt.% D-glucose).391  In the presence of catalytic amounts of SnCl4 (10 mol.%) and \n\nusing different ILs ([Bmim]X, with X=Cl-, BF4\n-, PF6\n\n-, (CF3SO2)2N\n-, CF3CO2\n\n-, CF3SO3\n-, saccharine; \n\n[Emim]BF4) at 100 \u00b0C/3 h, Hu et al.\n374 reported some interesting results for the reaction of D-\n\nglucose (10 wt.%), and the best result (for [Emim]BF4)  gave 57% YHmf (97% CGlu), which was \n\nconsiderable better than the result obtained for [Bmim]BF4 (37% YHmf  at 88% CGlu, Figure 1.32).  \n\nDifferences in acidity of the IL medium may affect the catalytic results. It has been reported that \n\n[Emim]BF4 tends to be more acidic than [Bmim]BF4 and that minor amounts of water in the IL may \n\nsignificantly influence the acidity of the IL medium.465 On the other hand, poorer results observed \n\nfor the ILs containing the anions Cl-, (CF3SO2)2N\n-, CF3CO2\n\n-, CF3SO3\n-, and saccharin were attributed \n\nto the superior coordinating ability of these species towards the Sn4+ cation, inhibiting the \n\ninteractions of the metal with D-glucose required for the isomerisation to D-fructose to selectively \n\nform Hmf.374 When ethylene glycol was added to the SnCl4/[Emim]BF4 system, a five-membered \n\nring chelate complex with Sn was formed inhibiting the reaction of D-glucose (CGlu &lt;5%).

The addition of 5 \u00c5 molecular \n\nsieves increased the YHmf to 48%.\n373  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.32- Lewis acid catalysts coupled with ILs as solvents in the dehydration of D-glucose        \n\nto 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf).

The presence of the IL was essential because when water was used instead of the IL, less \n\nthan 1% YHmf was obtained.\n334   \n\nThe expensive prices of [Emim]Cl used by Zhao et al.201 in the dehydration of D-glucose led \n\nto the search of cheaper ionic liquids.  Since [B4N]Cl is non-toxic and cheap it can be seen as an \n\nalternative to imidazolium-based ILs.313 [B4N]Cl coupled to CrCl2/DMA gave 56% YHmf (10 mol.% \n\ncatalyst) at 110 \u00b0C/4 h (Figure 1.32).313 [E4N]Cl coupled to CrCl2 (0.03 M)/DMSO/Benzene gave \n\n55% YHmf at 120 \u00b0C/1 h,\n332 which was improved when [E4N]Cl was coupled to CrCl3.6H2O (10 \n\nmol.%) with an outsanding result of 71% YHmf at 130 \u00b0C/10 min.\n305 Aprotic acids (DMSO or DMFA) \n\ninstead of [E4N]Cl gave lower YHmf of 22 and 42%, respectively, under the same reaction \n\nconditions, showing the good effect of the IL.305 Other ILs ([Pcohpy]Cl, [Pcmopy]Cl and \n\n[E3Nmeo]Cl) were also tested with CrCl2 as catalyst (0.03 M) but lower Hmf yields were obtained \n\n(30, 38 and 48% respectively) at 120 \u00b0C/1 h (Figure 1.32).332 These unsatisfactory results might be \n\nrelated with the possible instability of the hydroxyl group in the IL (especially for [Pcohpy]Cl), \n\nwhich easy undergo dehydration to form a double bond, and subsequently polymerisation.332 \n\nCheaper ILs such as [Bpy]BF4 were also tested using SnCl4 (10 mol.% instead of chromium catalysts \n\nat 100 \u00b0C/3 h, but the YHmf was only 20% (80% CGlu),\n374 despite better than the series of inorganic \n\nchloride salts tested by Zhao et al.201 \n\nThe results mentioned above for chromium catalysts fostered much research in CrClx/IL \n\ncatalytic systems for producing Hmf from D-glucose and related di/polysaccharides (Figures 1.32 \n\nand 1.34).  \n\nThe hydrolysis/dehydration reactions of the disaccharides D-cellobiose, D-maltose, and  \n\nD-sucrose into Hmf have been explored, using MClx/(imidazolium-IL) systems, in which M=Cr, Sn \n\nGe, Ir or Au (Table 1.8).196,230,305,322,324,329,334,374 In the case of D-sucrose, the best result is reported \n\nfrom Chun et al.230 that used a Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acid catalyst system: (CrCl2 or ZnCl2)/HCl \n\ncoupled to [Omim]Cl obtaining a maximum 82 wt.% YHmf  from D-sucrose (20 (wt/v)%) at             \n\n120 \u00b0C/0.5 h (Figure 1.34).230 Aqueous solutions of HCl (0.0-0.5M) were used firstly to promote the \n\nhydrolysis of D-sucrose, and (CrCl2 or ZnCl2)/IL was added to promote the selective dehydration of \n\nthe monosaccharides to give Hmf.230 For D-cellobiose, Hu et al.305,374 reported 22-23 wt.% YHmf \n\nusing the system SnCl4/[Emim]BF4 at 100 \u00b0C/3 h, or [E4N]Cl /CrCl3.6H2O at 130 \u00b0C/10 min (Table \n\n1.8, Figure 1.34). Binder et al.253 reported that CrCl2/[Emim]Cl (6 mol.% catalyst) can also be used \n\nto produce Hmf from other hexoses: D-mannose, D-lactose, D-galactose and D-tagatose (10 \n\nwt.%). 57% YHmf was obtained for D-mannose and 14-17% for the other substrates at 120 \u00b0C/2 h.  \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n93 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.34- Soluble solid catalysts coupled with ILs as solvents in the dehydration of disaccharides \n\n(e.g. D-maltose, D-cellobiose and D-sucrose) and polysaccharides (e.g. cellulose and inulin) to      \n\n5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf).  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe conversion of polysaccharides, such as cellulose and starch, and lignocellulosic \n\nbiomass, such as corn stover, into Hmf (in which Fur may also be formed) has been successfully \n\ncarried out in the presence of transition metal Lewis acid catalyst/IL systems (Table \n\n1.8.).196,322,329,334-337,373,374 One of the main objectives would be to improve Hmf yields directly from \n\ncellulose because it has a rather inexpensive availability from non-food resources. Su et. al.329 \n\nreported a one-pot catalytic of crystalline cellulose to Hmf; the cellulose was pre-dissolved in the \n\n(catalyst/IL) system at 100 \u00b0C/1 h before initiating the reaction (1 cm3 of H2O per gram of \n\ncellulose), depolymerising cellulose much faster than aqueous H2SO4. The resulting D-glucose was \n\nconverted to Hmf under mild reaction conditions. Catalytic amounts of a pair of metal chloride \n\nsalts (CuCl2/CrCl2) dissolved in [Emim]Cl as solvent were used; (6 total mol.% (Cu+Cr) with respect \n\nto  D-glucose units in the loaded cellulose (10 wt.%), mole fraction of CuCl2=0.17) and ca. 55% YHmf \n\nwas obtained at 120 \u00b0C/8 h for twelve replicate experiments (further details on the recycling \n\nprocedures are given in Section 1.5.3).329   \n\nThe DMA/LiCl system is good to dissolve cellulose (? 15 wt.% DMA/LiCl versus ? 0.7 wt.% \n\nDMA),196 as the association of the lithium cations with DMA to form DMA.Li+ macrocations results \n\nin high concentrations of weakly ion paired chloride ions that can form hydrogen bonds with the \n\nhydroxyl groups of cellulose, disrupting its intra and inter chain hydrogen bonds.476 Therefore, the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n94 \n \n\nmulticomponent catalyst consisting of CrClx (25 mol.%) and HCl (6 mol.%) was incorporated in the \n\nsolvent system (DMA-LiCl)/[Emim]Cl (60 wt.% IL; DMA with 10 mol.% LiCl) for the production of \n\nHmf from cellulose (4 wt.%) and corn stover (10 wt.%), giving 54 mol.% and 48 mol.% YHmf at     \n\n140 \u00b0C/2 h, and 34 mol.% YFur for corn stover.\n196 This system proposed by Binder et al.196 is \n\neffective in dissolving cellulose but since (DMA/LiCl) is miscible with most other solvents, it may \n\nbe less effective than the system (CuCl2/CrCl2/[Emim]Cl, proposed by Yu et al.\n329)  for the \n\nextraction of Hmf and reuse of the IL in further runs (detailed in Section 1.5.3). Nevertheless, the \n\nwork of Binder et al.196 is relevant as it was the first reporting on Hmf production from raw \n\nlignocellulosic biomass (dry corn stover) in an IL. The authors provided a new concept for the use \n\nof biomass as a raw material for renewable energy, and the biomass components which were not \n\nconverted into Hmf (such as lignin) were reformed to produce H2 for subsequent Hmf \n\nhydrogenolysis to give DMF. Other authors already assessed the effectiveness of the \n\nCrCl3/[Bmim]Cl catalytic system from cellulose giving good Hmf yield within a few minutes, using \n\nthe MW method (Table 1.8).334,336,340 Li et al.334 reported 62 mol.% YHmf within only 2 min (400 W, \n\ntemperature not mentioned; 10 wt.% catalyst relative to saccharide and 5 wt.% cellulose), \n\ndemonstrating the outstanding effect of the MW heating in comparison with CH  (17 mol.% YHmf at \n\n100 \u00b0C/4 h).334 By adding LiCl (50 mol.% Cr+50 mol.% Li) to the CrCl3/[Bmim]Cl system, Wang et \n\nal.335 obtained ca. 62 mol.% YHmf from 2.5 wt.% cellulose at 140 \u00b0C/40 min, or 61 mol.% YHmf from \n\n2.5 wt.% wheat straw at 160 \u00b0C/15 min (Table 1.8). The (CrCl3+LiCl)/[Bmim]Cl catalytic system was \n\nrecycled with success (Section 1.5.3) and gave better results for the conversion of cellulose to Hmf \n\nthan the catalysts H2SO4 (20 mol.% YHmf), NKC-9 (macroporous styrene-based sulfonic acid resin; \n\n18 mol.% YHmf), H3PW12O40 (12 mol.% YHmf), Cs2.5H0.5PMo12O40 (10 mol.% YHmf), sulfated titania, SBA-\n\n15 supported sulfated zirconia, Nb2O5 and Zr3(PO4)2 (&lt;5 mol.% YHmf) under similar reaction \n\nconditions (140 \u00b0C/40 min), using MW.335 \n\nTan et al.309 obtained 48 wt.% and 34 wt.% YHmf respectively when using [Bmim]Cl coupled \n\nto Ipr-CrCl2 (12 h) and CrCl2 (6 h), respectively from cellulose (6.7 wt.%) at 120 \u00b0C  in which the \n\nreaction with Ipr-CrCl2 was extracted two times with diethyl ether to prevent Hmf decomposition. \n\nThe lignocellulosic feedstock, rice straw, pine wood, and corn stalk gave 45-52 mol.% YHmf \n\nand 23-31 mol.% YFur within 3 min.\n337 Wu et al.340 obtained 55 mol.% YHmf at 160 \u00b0C/6 min from \n\ncellulose (Table 1.8). Using the catalytic system (HCl+CrCl2)/[Omim]Cl and ethyl acetate as co-\n\nsolvent, Chun et al.322 investigated the production of Hmf from different starch sources (20 wt.%) \n\nusing in a first stage aqueous HCl (0.5 M) to promote the hydrolysis reaction, followed by the \n\naddition of this mixture to CrCl2/[Omim]Cl/ethyl acetate to perform the selective dehydration into \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n95 \n\n \n\nHmf. A 60 wt.% YHmf (no Fur was detected) was reached in the case of tapioca starch at 120 \u00b0C/1 h \n\n(Table 1.8). Hu et al.374 obtained, in a one-pot process, 40 mol% YHmf (100% of conversion) from  \n\ninulin (20 wt.%), using the catalytic system SnCl4/[Emim]BF4 (10 mol.% SnCl4) at 100 \u00b0C/3 h.\n374  \n\nFor the production of Fur, Binder et al.277 investigated the reaction of D-xylose (10 wt.%) \n\nusing the systems [Bmim]Br (20 wt.%) coupled to DMA (55% YFur at 100 \u00b0C/4 h) or [Emim]Cl          \n\n(5 wt.%) coupled to DMA (45% YFur at 2 h ), and CrCl2 or CrCl3 as catalysts (6 mol.%). A mechanism \n\nwas proposed, in which chromium, acting as a Lewis acid, promotes the isomerisation of D-xylose \n\nto xylulose though a 1,2-hydride shift, and xylulose is dehydrated to Fur. The use of \n\n(CrClx+HCl)/[Emim]Cl (10 mol.% each catalyst) in the reaction of xylan (5 wt.% of birchwood, \n\nbeechwood, oat hull, or corn stover) gave 18-25 mol.% YFur at 140 \u00b0C/ 2 h.\n277 \n\nThe replacement of homogeneous acid catalysts by heterogeneous ones may increase the \n\ncost-competitiveness and decrease the environmental impact of IL-based systems for biomass \n\nconversion processes. \n\nSulfonic ion-exchange acid resins based on a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer, such as \n\nAmberlyst-15, NKC-9 (macroreticular resin) and DowexR-50WX8 (microreticular resin) have \n\nperformed well in the dehydration of D-fructose, using ILs as solvents, giving high                            \n\nHmf yields (Figure 1.35).201,306,311,343 Lansalot-Matras et al.311 reported on the dehydration of         \n\nD-fructose in the presence of  Amberlyst-15 as catalyst (2:1 mass ratio of catalyst/D-fructose) and  \n\n([Bmim]PF6 or [Bmim]BF4) in DMSO as solvent system (5:3 v/v), reaching 70-87% YHmf, \n\nrespectively, at 80 \u00b0C/32 h; 10 wt.% D-fructose in IL+DMSO (Figure 1.35). Under similar reaction \n\nconditions, in pure DMSO, only traces of Hmf yields were achieved in 44 h.311 The presence of \n\n[Bmim]BF4 in DMSO improved the YHmf to 36% after 32 h which illustrates the positive effect of ILs \n\nas solvents. In solely [Bmim]BF4, D-fructose is not completely soluble and a maximum 52% YHmf \n\nwas achieved. DMSO was required to enhance the solubility of D-fructose in these ILs as well as to \n\nprevent the formation of Hmf by-products, such as humins.311  \n\nDespite enhancing the solubility of the substrates in the IL medium, the addition of \n\nmiscible co-solvents may also decrease the viscosity and density of the IL medium (particularly \n\nwhen the co-solvents possess higher dielectric constants).449,450 Addition of acetone, DMSO, \n\nmethanol, ethanol or ethyl acetate (3-7 wt.% in the IL) to the system Amberlyst-15/[Bmim]Cl gave \n\n78-82% YHmf (91-95% CFru) at 25 \u00b0C/6 h (5 wt.% D-fructose was pre-dissolved in the IL at 80 \u00b0C/     \n\n20 min, prior to the addition of the solid acid at a.t.; resin/D-fructose mass ratio of 1).343  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n96 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.35- Insoluble organic acid resins coupled with ILs as solvents in the dehydration of          \n\nD-fructose to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf).  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFor rapidly reaching higher reaction temperatures MW irradiation was employed using \n\nAmberlyst-15/[Bmim]Cl to convert D-fructose into Hmf and 82% YHmf was achieved (ca. 100 % CFru) \n\nat 100 \u00b0C/3 min or 120 \u00b0C/1 min (details about recycling in Section 1.5.3).306  This work compares \n\nfavourably with that of Swatloski et al.,436 who  tested a similar IL ([Emim]Cl) with mixtures of \n\nchromium(II) chloride associated with N-heterocyclic carbenes (9 mol.% based on D-fructose), at \n\nthe same temperature of 100 \u00b0C but using CH with an external heat source (65-96% YHmf within     \n\n6 h).  \n\nMixtures of ILs and glycerol or glycerol carbonate (cheap, safe, and prepared from \n\nrenewable resources) have been identified by Benoit et al.302 as interesting solvent systems for \n\nthe acid-catalysed conversion of D-fructose and inulin. Amberlyst-70 coupled with an IL/(glycerol \n\ncarbonate) (65:35) solvent system gave 98% YHmf at 110 \u00b0C/35 min from D-fructose (40 wt.%) \n\n(Figure 1.35), while the reaction of 20 wt.% inulin in [Bmim]Cl/(glycerol carbonate) (10:90) gave \n\n60% YHmf at 110 \u00b0C (time not mentioned). A phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40) supported in a \n\nchromium based metal organic framework (MIL-101) coupled to [Emim]Cl gave 84% YHmf from     \n\nD-fructose at 80 \u00b0C and 1 h, and only 21% YHmf from D-glucose even at 100 \u00b0C and 3 h, showing \n\nagain the better efficiency of D-fructose.355 \n\nSolid acids coupled with ILs have been poorly explored in the biomass conversion \n\nprocesses using other sources besides D-fructose or D-glucose. Nevertheless, protonic forms of \n\nion-exchange acid resins (Amberlyst 15DRY, Dowex 50WX8, macroporous styrene-based sulfonic \n\nacid resin NK-9, perfluorinate sulfonic acid resin Nafion NR50) coupled with [Bmim]Cl as solvent \n\npromote the depolymerisation/hydrolysis of cellulose,477-481 and performed comparably to \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n97 \n\n \n\nconcentrated H2SO4.\n480 [Bmim]Cl coupled to sulfonated resins (Amberlyst-15  and Amberlyst-36), \n\norganic p-TsOH or mineral acid (H2SO4) from cellulose gave low YHmf (7-21 wt.%) at 120 \u00b0C/6 h.\n309 \n\nThese weak results in strongly acidic conditions speeded up cellulose hydrolysis, but also \n\npromoted the decomposition of Hmf into levulinic acid which explains the low Hmf yield \n\nobtained.309  \n\nAs an alternative to the use of ILs as solvents in the presence of an ion-exchange resin, \n\nacidic ILs (which will be further discussed in Section 1.5.2) have been successfully used in the one-\n\npot hydrolysis/dehydration of inulin. While a mixture of [Emim]HSO4 and a solid acid resin (5 wt.% \n\nof Amberlyst-15 in the IL) gave 65 mol.% YHmf at 100 \u00b0C/5 min, \n344 82 mol.% YHmf was reported \n\nwhen using [Bmim]HSO4 and [Bmim]Cl in two different stages: primary hydrolysis of inulin            \n\n(5 wt.%) in [Bmim]HSO4 gave 82% YFru at 80 \u00b0C/5 min, followed by the addition of a mixture of \n\nAmberlyst-15 and [Bmim]Cl for the subsequent dehydration of the D-fructose to Hmf at 80 \u00b0C/   \n\n60 min (details about the recycling process in Section 1.5.3).344  \n\n Guo et al.354 reported reported the dehydration of D-fructose (10 wt.%) into Hmf in the \n\npresence of carbonaceous catalysts using [Bmim]Cl. The best result was obtained with 10 wt.% \n\nLCC (lignin derived carbonaceous catalyst) with 84% YHmf (98% CFru) at 110 \u00b0C/10 min, using DMSO \n\nas co-solvent (DMSO/IL ratio=4/6) and MW (100 W) (Figure 1.36). The addition of DMSO \n\npromoted the reaction, because in its absence the  yield of Hmf was lower (71% at 100% CFru).\n354 \n\nWithout IL the Hmf yield decreased drastically to 38% (100% CFru) at 150 \u00b0C/1 h.\n354 For \n\ncomparison, with D-glucose and the LCC catalyst (5 wt.%), for the same mixture of [Bmim]Cl and \n\nDMSO under MW (100 W) gave a lower 68% YHmf (99% CGlu) even at a higher temperature of       \n\n160 \u00b0C/50 min.354  \n\nMesoporous SBA-15 functionalised with a propylsulfonic acid group, SBA-15-SO3H in \n\ncatalytic amounts (1 wt.%) coupled to [Bmim]Cl was very efficient in the dehydration of                \n\nD-fructose (10 wt.%) to Hmf with 81% YHmf (100% CFru) at 120 \u00b0C/1 h (Figure 1.36), which was \n\nsucessfully recycled as detailed in Section 1.5.3.353  \n\nSeveral solid oxides (e.g. ZrO2, B2O3 and P2O5) were tested in the dehydration of                 \n\nD-fructose.325,364 Qi et al.364 reported for bulk ZrO2 (2 wt.% catalyst) in [Bmim]Cl, 55% YHmf (60% \n\nCFru) at 100 \u00b0C/0.5 h.

The addition of protic solvents (e.g. methanol or ethanol) to the IL had a \n\nsynergistic effect (similar to water), promoting the isomerisation to D-fructose (4-23% YFru) and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n98 \n \n\n18-53% YHmf; in contrast for aprotic solvents (e.g. DMSO, DMFA or acetone)the YHmf was less than \n\n10%.369 Nevertheless, in the absence of IL, either protic (butanol) or aprotic (DMSO or DMA), gave \n\nno Hmf, possibly due to the fact that [Bmim]Cl dissolves better the ions and disrupt H-bonds due \n\nto its polarity.313 \n\nHigher Hmf yields were reported for P2O5 (5 mol.%)/[Bmim]Cl under mild conditions with \n\n82% YHmf at 50 \u00b0C/1 h (Figure 1.36).\n325 Other ILs ([Emim]Cl, [Emim]Br, [Bmim]Br) were also quite \n\neffective for P2O5 leading to 62-68% YHmf at 80 \u00b0C/0.5 h.\n325 The success of this system was mainly \n\nattributed to the acidic properties of P2O5, as in its absence no Hmf was formed in 1 h.\n325 Sulfated \n\nzirconium (ZrO2/SO4\n2-, 2 wt.%) coupled to several ILs ([Bmim]Cl, [Emim]Cl or [Hxmim]Cl), in the \n\ndehydration of D-fructose (5 wt.%) under MW, reached 88% YHmf (96% CFru), 82% (88% CFru), and \n\n89% (100% CFru), respectively, at 100 \u00b0C/0.5 h.\n364 Acidic ILs ([Emim]HSO4 and [Bmim]HSO4) coupled \n\nto ZrO2/SO4\n2- were very active (ca. 100% CFru) but less efficient (36-43% YHmf) due to the formation \n\nof insoluble humins promoted by the strong acidity of ILs.364 The basic [Bmim]CH3COO gave no \n\nHmf (75% CFru), possibly due to the leveling-off of the acidity of ZrO2/SO4\n2-.364 Nevertheless, the \n\nhigher acitivity of ZrO2/SO4\n2- in [Bmim]Cl from D-fructose (compared to ZrO2) is related to the \n\nhigher number of acid sites (recycling details in Section 1.5.3).364  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.36- ILs as solvents coupled with inorganic solid acids (e.g microporous H-ZSM-5,               \n\nH-Beta and H-Mordenite, mesoporous SBA-15-SO3H, zirconium and other oxides) in the \n\ndehydration of hexoses to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf). \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n99 \n\n \n\n Degimenci et al.482 immobilised a thin IL layer (1-triethoxysilyl)-propyl-3-methyl-\n\nimidazolium chloride, TES-[Pmim]Cl), on a mesoporous silica (SBA-15) to create a local reaction \n\nmicroenvironment on the solid support, through the silanol groups of the IL on the surface of  \n\nSBA-15.482 Afterwards the subsequent introduction of CrCl2 led to the formation of weakly bound \n\nactive species (Cr2+) with a high mobility (CrCl2-Im-SBA-15), which was beneficial for the selective \n\nconversion of D-glucose (10 wt.%) to Hmf:  the system (H2O/CrCl2/[Pmim]Cl) gave no Hmf \n\nwhereas in the system (H2O/CrCl2-Im-SBA-15), 23% YHmf (50% CGlu) was obtained at 150 \u00b0C/3 h.\n482 \n\nThe immobilisied IL stabilises the active mobile [CrCl4]\n2- complexes and avoids excessive \n\ninteractions with water which may favour non-selective routes of sugar conversion and catalyst \n\ndeactivation pathways.482 The addition of DMSO/2-BuOH/IBMK to CrCl2-Im-SBA-15, suppressed \n\nthe production of insoluble humins and led to 35% YHmf (50% CGlu).\n482 \n\n  Protonic forms of crystalline microporous zeolites of the type Faujasite Y, Beta, and  \n\nZSM-5, have been investigated in the hydrolysis of cellulose, using [Bmim]Cl as solvent (10 wt.% \n\nzeolite; 5 wt.% cellulose; MW, 240 W), giving more than 30% yield of D-glucose in less than         \n\n10 min.474 Tan et al.309 tested the system [Bmim]Cl/H-Y/CrCl2 for the reaction of cellulose (6.7 \n\nwt.%, 6.7 wt.% zeolite, &lt;1 wt.% CrCl2) and obtained 36 wt.% YHmf at 120 \u00b0C/6 h.\n309  Other zeolites \n\n(H-Beta,  H-Mordenite and H-ZSM-5) gave lower 19-23 wt.% YHmf (Figure 1.36).\n309 The assessement \n\nof the homo/heterogeneous catalytic nature of the insoluble solid acid/IL system is a critical issue, \n\nwhich will be discussed in Section 1.5.3. (\u201cRecycling of IL-based catalytic systems\u201d). \n\n \n\n  \n\n1.5.2. ILs as acid solvents/catalysts (dual function) \n\n  \n\n \n\nILs may possess intrinsic acid properties associated with the constituent anions \n\n(amphoteric HSO4\n-) and/or the cations (e.g. [Asbi]+, [Ascbi]+, [Hmim]+, [Sbmim]+, [Spmim]+),483 and \n\nmay play a role as acid catalysts and solvents, where a synergy could be expected from the \n\ncoupling of the acid and saccharide solubilisation properties of the ILs. Acidic ILs have also been \n\nused as catalysts with different solvents. The results shown in Figure 1.37 have been reported for \n\nacidic ILs used in the dehydration of D-fructose. 70-92% YHmf were obtained under quite moderate \n\nreaction conditions, for the dehydration of D-fructose (10-35 wt.%) at 80-90 \u00b0C, in about 30 min to \n\n1 h, using the ILs, [Hmim]Cl or [Sbmim]HSO4, without adding any other solvent (Figure \n\n1.37).202,342,463 Hu et al.202 under similar reaction conditions, reported [Hpy]Cl was similarly \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n100 \n \n\neffective in the reaction of D-fructose (31 wt.%) giving 70% YHmf (97% CFru) at 80 \u00b0C/1 h. In contrast, \n\n[EH3N]NO3, [TMG]CF3CO2, [TMG]Lac (Lac=lactate) and [Hpy]TolSO3 (TolSO3=p-toluenesulfonate) \n\ngave YHmf &lt;8% (14-34 wt.% D-fructose).\n446  Moreau et al.342 were pioneering in assessing the \n\nrecyclability of the dual function [Hmim]Cl (detailed in Section 1.5.3).342 The use of [Bmim]HSO4 as \n\ncatalyst instead of H2SO4, and [Bmim]Cl as solvent, gave 80% YHmf at 80 \u00b0C/30 min; (7.7 mol.% acid, \n\n10 wt.% D-fructose; Figure 1.37).463 Adding an immiscible co-solvent to the acidic IL reaction \n\nmedium allows the in situ extraction of Hmf as it is formed, which promotes the reaction of         \n\nD-fructose to Hmf and avoids decomposition of the latter through its reactions with intermediate \n\nproducts in the acidic IL phase. On the other hand, as mentioned before, the addition of an \n\nappropriate organic solvent may allow the viscosity of the reaction solution to be decreased \n\n(minimising mass transfer limitations).343,449,450 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.37- Acidic ILs used in the dehydration of hexoses (D-fructose unless otherwise indicated) \n\nto 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf).  \n\n \n\n  \n\nIt was reported that the Lewis acidic [Ascbi]CF3SO3 acts more effectively (in terms of        \n\nHmf yield) than its Br\u00f6nsted acidic counterpart [Asbi]CF3SO3 for the dehydration of D-fructose \n\n(78% and 62% YHmf, respectively, under MW, 200 W, with DMSO as co-solvent and at 80 \u00b0C/4 min). \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n101 \n\n \n\nHowever, in the presence of water (formed in the dehydration reaction) the hydrolysis of \n\n[Ascbi]CF3SO3 into [Asbi]CF3SO3 takes place.\n484 Nevertheless, the Br\u00f6nsted IL was quite effective \n\nwhen the temperature was raised from 80 to 160 \u00b0C (YHmf increased from 60 to 92%). Similar \n\nresults (83% YHmf at 100 \u00b0C/2 min) were reported for the Br\u00f6nsted-Lewis catalyst [Hmim]SO3Cl \n\nunder similar conditions (MW, 200 W, DMSO), giving better results than Br\u00f6nsted [Hmim]HSO4 IL \n\n(71% YHmf).\n485  \n\nThe nature of the cation may influence the Hmf yield. For protic ILs considerably higher \n\nHmf yields were reported for [NMP]HSO4 (69% YHmf at 99% CFru) and [NMP]CH3SO3 (72% YHmf at \n\n83% CFru) at 90 \u00b0C/2 h, than for [Hmim]HSO4 (24% YHmf at 46% CFru) or [Hmim]CH3SO3 (25% YHmf at \n\n40% CFru) used in catalytic amounts (7.5 mol.%) and with DMSO as solvent (ca. 7.5 wt.% D-\n\nfructose).486 These results correlated with the higher acidity of the [NMP]+-containing ILs. For \n\nthese ILs, the effects of the anions HSO4\n- or CH3SO3\n\n- (for each cation [NMP]+ or [Hmim]+) seemed \n\nless pronounced than those of the cations (for each anion).486  \n\nAn interesting \u201cgreen\u201d approach consisted of using eutectic mixtures containing [Cho]Cl \n\nand an organic acid (citric, malonic, and oxalic acids).202,306,311 [Cho]Cl/citric acid (30-35 mol.% \n\ncitric acid in [Cho]Cl) gave ca. 91% YHmf (98% CFru) at 80 \u00b0C/1 h from D-fructose (7 wt.%) using ethyl \n\nacetate as co-solvent for in situ extraction of Hmf. 202 Ethyl acetate favours the reaction because it \n\ndissolves Hmf but not D-fructose and is only slightly soluble in [Cho]Cl/citric acid.202 The recycling \n\nof [Cho]Cl/citric acid is discussed in detail in Section 1.5.3 and Table 1.9.202 [Cho]Cl/citric acid and \n\n[Cho]Cl/oxalic acid were both effective in the one-pot conversion of inulin (6-10 wt.%), giving  40 \n\nand 44 wt.% YHmf (91% and 100 mol.% of conversion), respectively, at 80 \u00b0C/2 h (Table 1.8).\n316 \n\nWhen adding ethyl acetate as co-solvent to [Cho]Cl/oxalic acid, 50 wt.% YHmf (100 mol.% of \n\nconversion) is obtained at 80 \u00b0C/ 2h.316 Furthermore the system [Cho]Cl/oxalic acid was recycled \n\nwith success as explained in Section 1.5.3.202,316  In a different approach, [Cho]Cl has been used as \n\nadditive for preparing low melting carbohydrate mixtures with p-TsOH as catalyst (10 mol.%).  \n\n67% YHmf at 100 \u00b0C/30 min from D-fructose, 25 mol.% YHmf from D-sucrose at 100 \u00b0C/1 h and 57 \n\nmol.% YHmf from inulin at 90 \u00b0C/1 h were obtained.\n310  \n\nAcidic IL-based systems are generally less effective for Hmf production from D-glucose \n\nand related di/polysaccharides than from D-fructose and related ones (Figure 1.37). Tong et al.486 \n\ntested the protic ILs [NMP]HSO4 and [NMM]CH3SO3 and DMSO as solvent under the same \n\nexperimental conditions as those used for D-fructose, which gave very poor results (2-3 YHmf at     \n\n90 \u00b0C/2 h).486 The Br\u00f6nsted acidic ILs [Hmim]HSO4 or [Bmim]HSO4 coupled with CrCl3 and using \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n102 \n \n\nMW (20 mol.% catalyst, 5 wt.% D-glucose) gave poor results: YHmf &lt;10% at 120 \u00b0C/min. These \n\nresults were worse than those obtained with the system [Emim]Cl/CrCl3.\n336  \n\nFor the reaction of D-sucrose (25 wt.%) in [Hmim]Cl, Hmf was selectively formed from the \n\nfructofuranosyl units (ca. 100%); glucopyranosyl units gave essentially D-glucose at 90 \u00b0C/30 min \n\n(Table 1.8);342 recycling was not achieved with success (Section 1.5.3).342  \n\nThe acidic IL [Sbmim]HSO4 was poorly efficient in converting cellulose into Hmf.\n376 The \n\npoor results reported for the acidic ILs in the conversion of cellulose into Hmf may be related to \n\nthe poor selectivity of the conversion of monosaccharides into Hmf, since the hydrolysis step has \n\nbeen effectively carried out using different acidic ILs (such as e.g. [Sbmim]HSO4 \n\n[Bmim]HSO4/[Bmim]Cl, [Sbmim]Cl, [Spmim]Cl).\n300,376,487,488 The addition of an aqueous solution of \n\nLewis acid FeCl2 (5 wt.%) to the acidic IL system [Sbmim]HSO4/IBMK, in the hydrolysis of \n\nmicrocrystalline cellulose (ca. 6 wt.%), was found to enhance the YHmf and YFur at 150 \u00b0C/5 h from \n\n15 wt.% and 7 wt.% (70 wt.% of conversion), respectively (without FeCl2) to 34 wt.% and 19 wt.% \n\n(84 wt.% of conversion) with FeCl2.\n376 Recycling details are described in Section 1.5.3. A similar \n\nactivity was observed when catalytic amounts of CoSO4 were coupled to the IL [Sbmim]HSO4 with \n\nIBMK as co-solvent in the conversion of cellulose (24 wt.% YHmf and 17 wt.% YFur for    84 wt.% of \n\nconversion) at 150 \u00b0C/300 min.377  In the absence of CoSO4, the YHmf and YFur decreased to 15 wt.% \n\nand 8 wt.% (70% of conversion), respectively.377 Kim et al.489 tested various bisulfate ILs \n\n[Bmim]HSO4, [Hmim]HSO4, [Morph]HSO4, [B4N]HSO4, [B4P]HSO4, [Cho]HSO4 in the conversion of \n\nagar using a catalytic amount of ILs in aqueous solutions at 121 \u00b0C/15 min, in which the highest \n\nHmf yield was reported for [B4N]HSO4 (2 wt.% YHmf).\n489  \n\nIn order to obtain Fur, acidic ILs were employed using [Sbmim]HSO4 as catalyst (50 wt.%) \n\nand D-xylose in a mixture of H2O/IBMK.\n275 An outstanding result of 91 wt% YFur (95% CXyl) was \n\nobtained at 150 \u00b0C/25 min, comparing favourably to Lewis acids (AlCl3, SnCl2, 72-78 wt.% YFur), \n\nmineral acids (HCl or H2SO4, 70-72 wt.% YFur) or HPA H3PW12O40 (48 wt.% YFur). The acidic IL \n\n[Bmim]HPO4 was also tested but was less effective under the same conditions (68 wt.%  YFur at \n\n80% CXyl). Recycling tests are detailed in the next Section (1.5.3).\n275  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n103 \n\n \n\n1.5.3. Recycling of IL-based catalytic systems \n\n \n\n \n\n Several types of homogeneous IL-based catalytic systems have been reused in \n\nconsecutive runs without observing a decrease in Fur/Hmf yields (Table 1.9), such as solid acid \n\ncatalysts soluble in the IL (BHC/[Cho]Cl/H2O, seven runs),\n356 mineral acids coupled to ILs \n\n(HCl/[Bmim]Cl,  six runs),432 metal chlorides  (CrCl3/[Bmim]Cl, six runs),\n336 (Ipr-CrCl2/[Bmim]Cl, four \n\nruns),330,468 (GeCl4/[Bmim]Cl, five runs),\n373 (SnCl4/[Emim]BF4, four runs),\n\n374 (IrCl3/[Omim]Cl,         \n\nfive runs),339 (CrCl3.6H2O/[E4N]Cl, five runs),\n305 [(CrCl3+LiCl)/[Bmim]Cl, three runs],\n\n335  \n\n(CuCl2/CrCl2/[Emim]Cl; twelve runs).\n329 Insoluble (solid acid)/IL catalytic systems have been less \n\nexplored and can be recycled without the need for separating the solid acid from the IL,306 similar \n\nto that performed for soluble acid/IL systems.  Insoluble solid acids coupled to ILs commonly \n\ninclude ion-exchange resins, such as Amberlyst-15/[Bmim]Cl (seven runs).306 Although insoluble \n\nresins/IL catalytic systems are recycled as mixtures, an interesting recycling process for the \n\nregeneration of ILs was reported using an ion-exchange resin for converting [Bmim]HSO4 into \n\n[Bmim]Cl. The regeneration of the used ion-exchange resin (into the Cl- form) with NaCl gave \n\nNaHSO4 as product, which, in turn, could be used in the conversion of [Bmim]Cl to [Bmim]HSO4, \n\ngiving NaCl as co-product (used for regenerating the used ion-exchange resin).344 Other inorganic \n\noxides include ZrO2/SO4\n2-/[Bmim]Cl (six runs),364 and hydroxyapatite supported chromium chloride \n\ncoupled to [Bmim]Cl (five runs).472 Hybrid materials (organic-inorganic) coupled to IL have been \n\nrecently tested achieving interesting results (SBA-15-SO3H/[Bmim]Cl, three times).\n353 Attempting \n\nto facilitate the separation of Hmf from the IL and recycling, silica gel-supported ionic liquids \n\n(ILIs),(ILIS-SO3H and ILIS-SO2Cl, seven runs) gave good results.\n484 In contrast, the analogous sulfuric \n\nacid (SiO2-SO3H) and sulfonylchloride (SiO2-SO2Cl) modified silica gels exhibited a drastic decrease \n\nof Hmf yield in only three runs (the authors did not explain the catalyst deactivation phenomena, \n\nTable 1.9).484 Bifunctional ILs (acidic ILs that work as solvents and catalysts) are yet another class \n\nof IL-based catalytic systems that can be reused without significant drops in the Fur/Hmf yields \n\n(e.g. [Hmim]Cl, five runs),342 ([NMP]CH3SO3/DMSO, five runs),\n486  and acidic ionic liquid coupled to \n\nsoluble inorganic solids (FeCl2/[Sbmim]HSO4/IBMK, five runs),\n376 or with a co-solvent \n\n([Sbmim]HSO4/IBMK, five runs).\n275 Other types of ILs include ([Cho]Cl/citric acid/ethyl acetate), \n\neight runs),202 and ([Cho]Cl/oxalic acid/ethyl acetate, six runs).316 \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n104 \n \n\n The first step of the recycling procedures commonly involves the solvent extracton of \n\nthe target products Fur/Hmf, using organic solvents, which are poorly miscible with the IL medium \n\n(Table 1.9). Extracting solvents include ethyl acetate,202,275,305,306,316,335,336,364,373,374,486  IBMK,329,356 \n\nTHF,353,432 diethyl ether,330,342,376,468 and toluene (Table 1.9). The addition of ethyl acetate is \n\nfavourable for enhancing the Hmf yield, avoiding both thermal decomposition and polymerisation \n\nreactions between Hmf.306 Besides presenting a low boiling point, ethyl acetate can reduce the \n\nenergy costs and allow the IL to be easily reused because the IL and substrate are not soluble in \n\nethyl acetate (Table 1.9). These solvents can as well extract small amounts of water from the \n\nIL/catalyst phase when used as co-solvents, working as in situ Fur/Hmf extraction.432 For example, \n\nfor the system [NMP]CH3SO3/DMSO, DMSO was separated from the IL phase by distillation under \n\nreduced pressure and pure Hmf was further obtained after drying with anhydrous sodium \n\nsulfate.486 However the use of high-boiling point miscible co-solvents, such as DMSO (miscible \n\nwith a wide range of polar and non-polar solvents), may require energy intensive and laborious \n\nseparation processes to recover Hmf (b.p. 114-116 \u00b0C at 1x102 Pa) from the reaction medium. In \n\nthis sense, low boiling co-solvents, such as acetonitrile (which gave interesting results, as \n\ndiscussed above in Section 1.5.2198), or mixing different ILs,344,463 might be preferable. \n\n  In the system BHC/[Cho]Cl/H2O, the Hmf (and other products) were extracted from the \n\nBHC/IL (D-fructose) phase, by decantation with IBMK.356A pair of metal chlorides in the IL \n\n(CuCl2/CrCl2/[Emim]Cl (cellulose)) was separated from the target product by IBMK.\n329 In other \n\nsystems, Fur or Hmf (and other products) were extracted and separated from SBA-15-\n\nSO3H/[Bmim]Cl (D-fructose) using THF followed by an evaporation step, \n353 or simple extraction \n\nfrom HCl/[Bmim]Cl (fructose),432 by THF from CrCl3/[Bmim]Cl (D-glucose),\n336  GeCl4/[Bmim]Cl               \n\n(D-fructose),373 SnCl4/[Emim]BF4 (D-glucose),\n374 [Cho]Cl/citric acid (D-fructose),202 [Cho]Cl/oxalic \n\nacid (inulin),316 [Sbmim]HSO4/IBMK (D-xylose),\n275 by ethyl acetate, or from Ipr-CrCl2/[Bmim]Cl     \n\n(D-fructose and D-glucose),330,468 and acidic [Hmim]Cl (D-fructose and D-sucrose) by diethyl \n\nether.342 Some authors added water to the IL-based catalytic system after the reaction to \n\ndecrease the IL viscosity (accompained by accumulation of by-products), before the extraction: \n\nCrCl3.6H2O/[E4N]Cl (D-glucose) by ethyl acetate,\n305 (CrCl3+LiCl)/[Bmim]Cl (cellulose and wheat \n\nstraw),335 Amberlyst-15/[Bmim]Cl (D-fructose),306 ZrO2/SO4\n2-/[Bmim]Cl (D-fructose),364 and \n\nFeCl2/[Sbmim]HSO4/IBMK (cellulose) by diethyl ether, in which water and IBMK were added \n\nafterwards.376 The latter system was used with success in five consecutive runs but decreases in \n\nthe values of the yields of Hmf and Fur were observed from the first to the second run, which \n\nwere attributed to the incomplete extraction of by-products from the IL prior to recycling (Table \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n105 \n\n \n\n1.9).376 In the system [NMP]CH3SO3/DMSO (D-fructose), the biggest part of Hmf was extracted \n\nfrom the DMSO phase and the remaining IL phase was further extracted with ethyl acetate after \n\nwater addition.486 Recently Wei et al.339 developed an interesting vacuum distillation process for \n\ncontinuous extraction of Hmf from the IrCl3/[Omim]Cl phase (D-fructose, D-glucose). The Hmf \n\nyield in the recycled system was sometimes higher than the one with the fresh catalyst, which \n\nwas attributed to small amounts of D-fructose from the previous cycle.305,306,330,364,468 Prior to the \n\nnext run, the catalyst/IL was pre-heated to water and residual solvent removal at 50 \u00b0C;432 at 50 \u00b0C \n\nfor 24 h,202 60 \u00b0C for 24 h,275,306,336 65 \u00b0C for 24 h305 or 75 \u00b0C for 12 h486 in a vacuum oven; at 65 \u00b0C \n\nin a vacuum drier,335 and at 100 \u00b0C for 2 h.329,330,468 It is essential to dry the IL, or otherwise the \n\nHmf yields decrease in consecutive batch runs.329 \n\n Many authors reported that no fresh catalyst is required in a new                                   \n\nrun.202,305,306,316,329,330,335,336,339,353,356,364,373,374,376,432,468 A comparison with a recycling test \n\nwith/without  addition of fresh catalyst was similar, meaning the homogeneous catalyst was well \n\nretained in the IL.329 By pH measurements Lai et al.432 also proved that the catalyst was fullly \n\nretained in the IL. Heterogeneous SBA-15-SO3H catalyst was reported to be stable, low cost, low \n\ntoxic, being quite promissing for this reaction.305,353 \n\n The gradual accumulation of water and other by-products in the recycled IL medium \n\nmay eventually lead to a decay in the overall efficiency of these catalytic processes and therefore \n\nrequire the purification of the IL medium at a certain stage (Table 1.9).202,342,432 The accumulation \n\nof water has a negative effect on the catalytic reaction in consecutive batch runs because the IL \n\nmay form a hydrogen bonded complex with water, possible leveling off the acidity of the IL.450,460 \n\nUnavoidable accumulation of humins was noticed with an increasing number of recycling \n\nruns.336,339,356 Non-volatile by-products, including humins, may be precipitated from the IL medium \n\nby adding a miscible solvent to the IL with appropriate polarity (e.g. ethanol), being further \n\nremoved by filtration316,339 (Table 1.9). The removal of dark solid known as humins by filtration \n\nmight increase the lifetime of the catalytic system.329   \n\n The effectiveness of IL-based catalytic systems is also dependent on the substrate used. \n\nYong et al.330,468 recycled system was efficient for D-fructose but not for D-glucose in which the    \n\nHmf yield decreased gradually with further runs.330,468 The different catalytic results in recycling \n\nruns for the two hexoses may be due to the high concentration of   by-products retained in the IL-\n\nbased catalytic system in the case of D-glucose (less selective reaction) than that of D-fructose, \n\ncausing inhibitory effects.330,468 Moreau et al.342 also reported a less efficient separation of Hmf \n\nfrom the IL when using D-sucrose as the substrate; according to the authors D-glucose does not \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n106 \n \n\nsignificantly react with the IL and accumulates in the IL medium (being more difficult to extract \n\nfrom less polar solvents such as diethyl ether).342 In the case of insoluble solid acid/IL catalytic \n\nsystems, the removal of insoluble humins from the IL medium may require the separation of the \n\nsolid acid from the IL medium. With ZrO2/SO4\n2- as catalyst, the decrease in the catalytic acitivity \n\nafter the 10th run was attributed to a decrease of acid sites in the catalyst  (catalyst surface \n\npassivation) by accumulated by-products and a decrease in the contents of SO4\n2- in the catalyst \n\n(leaching).364  Subsequently, the removal of organic matter from the used solid acid may be \n\nperformed by thermal degradation or by chemical attack using oxidising agents. The solid acid \n\nmay need to be regenerated to recover its initial acid properties (e.g. through ion-exchange).490  \n\n In general, the number of recycling runs reported in the literature is less than ten. \n\nPerforming more runs and elemental analysis of the recovered IL medium can help to better \n\nassess the recycling efficiency of the different approaches of the IL-based catalytic systems.  \n\nCertain homogeneous acid/IL catalytic systems suffer loss of catalysts during the work-up \n\nprocedures,  possibly due to catalyst deactivation in the IL and/or the inhibitor effect of water \n\n(when no drying processes are mentioned). Such cases were observed in the system                    \n\nIpr-WCl6/[Bmim]Cl in which the separation of accumulated by-products from the IL phase (by \n\nfiltration) and the addition of fresh catalyst was required to maintain the high Hmf yield, being \n\npoorly attractive with respect to the catalyst recycling.328 In IrCl3/[Bmim]Cl, the loss of IrCl3 from \n\nthe IL medium during the solvent extraction process led to a decrease in product yield in recycling \n\nruns (Table 1.9).324 Degirmenci et al.482 developed a promising catalytic system by coordinating \n\nCrCl2 to [Pmim]Cl, avoiding  catalytic species from excessive interaction with the solvent. \n\nHowever, chromium leaching in recycling runs for the system CrCl2/[Pmim]Cl/SBA-15 led to a drop \n\nin catalytic activity.  \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n107 \n\n \n\nTable 1.9- Summary of the recycling procedures and efficiency of IL based catalytic systems. a \n\nSubstrate/IL/Catalyst added/Co-\n\nsolvent \nSeparation of  the target reaction \n\nproduct \nSeparation of by-products from \n\nthe IL system \nNo. \n\nRuns \nb\n \n\nVariation of YHmf or YFur \nc\n Ref \n\nHomogeneous Br\u00f6nsted catalyst + IL \nD-Fructose/[Bmim]Cl/HCl Solvent extraction using THF Heating under vacuum (50 \u00b0C) for \n\nwater removal after run 3 \n6 ?

This point is seldom addressed in the \n\npublished literature related to solid acid/IL catalytic systems used in the conversion of \n\ncarbohydrates into Hmf/Fur. The stability of the inorganic solid acid catalysts, in ILs is rather \n\nunexplored.491 Interesting results were reported for the system Cr-HAP/[Bmim]Cl, which was used \n\nin five consecutive batch runs of the reaction of D-glucose without drop of Hmf yield (Table \n\n1.9).472 In that study, the assessment of the homo/heterogeneous nature of the catalytic reaction \n\nwas not addressed. Ion-exchange reactions between acid-form zeolites and ILs can take place \n\ngiving homogeneous (soluble) active acid species.492-494 The same can apply for ion-exchange \n\nresins.477-479,490,495-497 Nevertheless, using Br\u00f6nsted solid acids (possessing an insoluble anionic \n\npolymeric framework) instead of homogeneous acids may be advantageous in that the formation \n\nof by-products in reactions involving the free anions is avoided (e.g. sulfur containing by-products, \n\nin the case of H2SO4 as catalyst, causing downstream contaminations and affecting the yields of \n\nFur/Hmf and, on the other hand, the regeneration of the acid properties of the catalytic system \n\ncan be more efficient than that for soluble acid catalysts.490 \n\n \n\nThis work focuses on the conversion of saccharides into Fur and/or Hmf using \n\nheterogeneous catalysts in an aqueous medium (Chapters 3-7) or using an ionic liquid medium \n\n(Chapters 8, 9). The production of Hmf has not reached the industrial scale; the same does not \n\napply for Fur. As mentioned previously, sulfuric acid is used in most of these industrial processes \n\nand presents several drawbacks, which can be avoided with the use of heterogeneous catalysts. \n\nThe objectives of this work included: (i) use of heterogeneous catalysts with promising catalytic \n\nperformances in terms of activity, selectivity and stability, leading to high Fur/Hmf yields; (ii) \n\nidentification of the reaction (by)products in order to get mechanistic insights into the overall \n\nreaction mechanism; (iii) understanding of catalyst deactivation phenomena: (iv) efficient \n\nregeneration and reuse of the catalysts. The catalytic performance of crystalline microporous \n\nsilicoaluminophosphates (SAPOs) with different pore sizes (Chapter 3), zeolite Beta and a \n\ncomposite material consisting of zeolite Beta nanocrystals (Si/Al=12) embedded in a purely \n\nsiliceous TUD-1 mesoporous matrix (BEATUD-1, Chapter 5) were investigated in the dehydration \n\nof D-xylose to Fur. The zeolite MCM-22, delaminated ITQ-2 (Chapter 6) and mixed zirconium \n\noxides (Chapter 7) were also tested. Aluminium-containing mesoporous TUD-1 (denoted Al-TUD-\n\n1, Si/Al=21) was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst in the conversion of different types of \n\nsaccharides to Fur/Hmf (Chapter 4).  \n\n\n\nConversion of carbohydrate biomass to furanic aldehydes \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n111 \n\n \n\nThe use of ionic liquid (IL) based catalytic systems aimed at obtaining high Fur/Hmf yields \n\nusing relatively high initial concentrations of carbohydrates and mild reaction conditions. The acid \n\nionic liquid [Emim]HSO4 (with solvent-catalyst dual function) was tested in the conversion of \n\nmono/di/polysaccharides into Fur/Hmf (Chapter 8). The dehydration of (demanding) D-glucose \n\ninto Hmf was investigated using [Bmim]Cl as solvent and (chromium, aluminium)-containing \n\nsilicates (Chapter 9). Special attention was given to the recovery and reuse of the IL-based \n\ncatalytic systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.6. References \n\n \n\n \n\n (1) Klass, D.

The aluminophosphate gel was prepared with 85 wt.% of \n\northophosphoric acid and distilled water. To this mixture was added Plural SB Al2O3 (70 wt.%) as \n\nan aluminium source. The mixture was stirred for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous gel.  The Aerosil \n\nA380 was then added and the gel was further stirred for another 1 h, prior to template addition. \n\nAfter another 2 h of stirring, the final homogeneou gel were loaded into 40 cm3 PTFE-coated \n\nstainless steel autoclaves and heated under autogeneous pressure, at 170 \u00b0C during 11 h. The \n\ncompositional molar ratio of the final reaction mixture was Al2O3:P2O5:0.45 SiO2:TPA:50 H2O. The \n\nsolid phase was recovered by centrifugation, washed several times with distilled water, dried \n\novernight at 100 \u00b0C and finally calcined at 600 \u00b0C for 8 h under air.  \n\nTwo SAPO-11 samples (SAPO-11a and SAPO-11b) with different morphologies and crystal \n\nsizes were prepared by hydrothermal crystallisation according to the procedures described \n\nearlier.3-5 SAPO-11a was synthesised using only one template (DPA), while SAPO-11b was \n\nobtained by using a combination of two templates (DPA as conventional template and MA as co-\n\ntemplate). For the preparation of the two samples, pseudoboehmite aluminium (Al-PSB), \n\northophosporic acid and silica (Si-A380-D) for the MA and DPA based sample (SAPO-11b) and \n\nsilica (Si-A) for DPA based sample (SAPO 11a) were used as sources of aluminium, phosphorous \n\nand silicon, respectively.5 The compositions of the initial gels were: Al2O3:P2O5:1.5 DPA:0.66 \n\nSiO2:40 H2O for SAPO-11a (molar ratio) and Al2O3:P2O5:DPA:0.3 MA:0.66 SiO2:50 H2O for SAPO-11b \n\n(molar ratio). The homogeneous gels obtained were loaded into PTFE coated stainless steel \n\nautoclaves and subjected to crystallisation under autogeneous pressure at 200 \u00b0C during 24 h.3,5 \n\nThe final solid phases were recovered by centrifugation, washed several times with distilled water \n\nand dried overnight at 100 \u00b0C. The template-free materials were obtained using a two step \n\ncalcination: from a.t. to 500 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C.min-1 under N2 flow (5 dm\n3.h-1.g-1), \n\nfollowed by a 2 h isotherm at 500 \u00b0C,3,5 then up to 650 \u00b0C at the same heating rate under air flow, \n\nfollowed by an isotherm at 650 \u00b0C for 8 h. White powders were obtained.5 \n\nSAPO-40 was synthesised accordingly to that described in the literature.2,4,6,7 The sources \n\nof aluminium, phosphorus and silicon used were pseudoboehmite alumina (Al-CB), \n\northophosphoric acid (85 wt.%) and fumed silica (Si-A200), respectively. Under continuous \n\nstirring, 5.22  g of Al-CB was added slowly to 9.22 g of H3PO4 and 5.78  g of distilled water, forming \n\nan extremely viscous mixture, slurry A. The solution was then homogenised for 4 h at 20 \u00b0C in a \n\nclosed beaker. A solution B was prepared by mixing 1.04 g of Si-A200 to 40.82 g of the organic \n\n\n\nExperimental \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n139 \n\n \n\ntemplate tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH 40 wt.% aqueous solution). After 2 h of \n\nstirring at ambient temperature (a.t.), the solution B was poured into a dispersion of solution A \n\nand the two phases were vigorously stirred for 90 min. The composition of the final reaction \n\nmixture in molar oxide ratios was: Al2O3:P2O5:0.4SiO2:(TPA)2O:50H2O.  The gel obtained was then \n\npoured in a PTFE-lined stainless-steel autoclave, placed in an oven pre-heated at 200 \u00b0C and the \n\ncrystallisation was conducted under static conditions for 160 h. The autoclaves were cooled to a.t. \n\nand the crystalline solid was recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with 60 cm3 of \n\ndistilled water and dried overnight at 100 \u00b0C. Finally it was calcined at a rate of 5 \u00b0C.min-1 under N2 \n\nflow, from 20 to 550 \u00b0C and maintained at that temperature for 8 h under dry air flow.8 \n\n \n\n \n\n 2.1.2. Mesoporous aluminosilicate (Al-TUD-1) \n\n \n \n\nThe material described herein was tested as a catalyst in Chapter 4.

The \n\nprocedure was as follows: TEOS (17.3 g, 83 mmol) was added to AIP (0.68 g, 3.33 mmol), which \n\nwas previously dissolved in a mixture of isopropanol (6.5 cm3) and ethanol (6.5 cm3). After stirring \n\nat a.t. for a few min, a mixture of TENA (12.51 g, 83.9 mmol) and water (Milli-Q, 9.4 g) was added, \n\nfollowed by the addition of tetraethylammonium hydroxide, TEAOH (35 wt.% in Milli-Q water, \n\n11.12 cm3, 27.0 mmol) under vigorous stirring.  \n\nThe wet gel obtained was stirred at a.t. for 24 h and dried at 98 \u00b0C for another 24 h. Then \n\nit was hydrothermally treated in a PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h. Finally the \n\nsolid was calcined at 600 \u00b0C in static air for 10 h (heating rate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.3. Zeolite BEA and BEATUD-1 composite \n\n \n\n \n\nThe materials described herein were tested as catalysts in Chapter 5. Table 2.3 collects all \n\nthe chemicals used for the syntheses of the catalysts. All reagents were used as received. \n\n \n\nTable 2.3- Chemicals used in the syntheses of zeolite BEA and BEATUD-1 catalysts. \n\nChemicals \n\n \nAbbreviation Supplier Purity \n\nTetraethylorthosilicate TEOS Sigma 99.9% \n\nOrganic template, Triethanolamine TENA Aldrich 99.9% \n\nTetraethylammonium hydroxide, 35 wt.% aqueous \n\nsolution \n\nTEAOH Aldrich 99.9% \n\nEthanol  Panreac PA \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nExperimental \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n141 \n\n \n\nTo obtain the zeolite Beta in the proton form (denoted BEA) the commercial ammonium-\n\nform of the Beta powder (NH4BEA, Zeolyst CP814E) was calcined at 550 \u00b0C for 10 h with a heating \n\nrate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1 in static air. Afterwards an interconnected meso- and microporous composite \n\nmaterial denoted BEATUD-1 was prepared by embedding H-Beta nanocrystallites in a 3 D \n\nmesoporous silica matrix (TUD-1) with a zeolite loading of 40 wt.%, following the procedure \n\ndescribed by Maschmeyer et al.14,15 The high porosity of the mesoporous matrix allows a higher \n\naccessibility to the internal zeolite crystals by external reagents. The silica precursor, \n\ntetraethylorthosilicate, TEOS (5.34 g, 25.6 mmol) was added drop by drop to a stirred suspension \n\nof BEA (1.0 g) in a mixture of triethanolamine TENA (3.85 g, 25.8 mmol) and water (Milli-Q, 3.0 g). \n\nThe organic templating agent, a mesopore-forming organic compound, is usually a glycol (with \n\ntwo or more hydroxyl groups) or amine compounds such as TENA (used in the present procedure) \n\nand triethylene pentamine with boiling points of at least 150 \u00b0C.15 Then, TEAOH (35 wt.% in    \n\nMilli-Q water; 3.42 g, 8.2 mmol) was added rapidly under stirring for ca. 2 h. Due to the vigorous \n\nstirring, the zeolite particles were homogeneously dispersed in the synthesis mixture before \n\ngelation,14  and due to the rapid increase of the viscosity in the transition of liquid to thick gel the \n\nvigorous stirring was maintained during and after gelation.14 Afterwards the thick gel containing \n\nthe homogeneous dispersion of zeolite crystals was aged at a.t. in order to complete the \n\nhydrolysis and poly-condensation of the inorganic oxide source for 24 h.14,15 Afterwards, the gel \n\nwas dried at 100 \u00b0C for another 24 h.  Preferably, the organic template should remain in the gel \n\nduring the drying stage. The dried material that still contains the organic template is heated to a \n\ntemperature at which there is a substantial formation of mesopores which is typically between \n\nthe boiling point of Milli-Q water and the boiling point of the organic template.15 Since the pore-\n\nforming step can be performed hydrothermally in a sealed vessel at autogenous pressure,15 the \n\nsolid material was transferred to a PTFE-lined autoclave and heated under static conditions at  \n\n180 \u00b0C for 8 h. The size and volume of the mesopores in the final product depend partly on the \n\ntemperature and duration of the hydrothermal step. If the temperature and the treatment time \n\nare increased, the mesopore diameter and the mesoporore volume will be enhanced.15  \n\n The product was recovered, washed with distilled water and dried overnight at 60 \u00b0C. \n\nFinally, the solid was calcined at 600 \u00b0C for 10 h with a heating ramp rate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1 in static air \n\nto remove organic template agent and the catalyst was finally formed.  \n\nThe purely siliceous TUD-1 material was prepared using the same procedure as the one \n\ndescribed for the composite material but without zeolite.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n142 \n \n\nThe catalysts were manually ground using an agate pestle and mortar and subsequently \n\nsieved to give a powder with particle sizes of less than 150 \u00b5m width. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.4.  Zeolite MCM-22 and the related delaminated material ITQ-2 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe materials described herein were tested as catalysts in Chapter 6. Table 2.4 collects all \n\nthe chemicals used for the syntheses of the catalysts.

Decreasing the aluminium content of the zeolite precursor leads to a \n\nlower charge density, and therefore the interactions between the zeolitic layers are weaker, \n\nwhich facilitates the delamination process.18-21 In the case of Pre-MCM-22(30), sodium aluminate \n\n(53% Al2O3, 47% Na2O, 0.587 g, 6.10 mmol) and sodium hydroxide (1.03 g, 25.7 mmol) were \n\ndissolved in water (Milli-Q, 156 g, 8.67 mol). Hexamethyleneimine (8.36 g, 84.3 mmol) was then \n\nadded and the mixture was stirred for 45 min, followed by the addition, under agitation, of silica \n\n\n\nExperimental \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n143 \n\n \n\n(Si-A200-D, 11.0 g, 183.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred for a further 2 h to give a gel which was \n\ntransferred to a 250 cm3 PTFE-lined stainless-steel autoclave, rotated at 50 r.p.m, and heated at \n\n135 \u00b0C for 11 days. After this period of time, the autoclave was quenched in cold water. The solid \n\nphase was separated by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with deionised water until            \n\npH &lt;9.0, and subsequently dried at 25 \u00b0C overnight. Finally, part of the solid was calcined under \n\nstatic air at 540 \u00b0C for 6 h, giving Na-MCM-22(24) (in parenthesis, the bulk Si/Al atomic ratio \n\nmeasured by ICP-AES). A similar procedure was followed to prepare Pre-MCM-22(50), which upon \n\ncalcination gave Na-MCM-22(38).  \n\nThe delaminated aluminosilicate, ITQ-2, was prepared from Pre-MCM-22(30) as follows: \n\nThe Pre-MCM-22(30) (10 g) was dispersed in Milli-Q water (20 g), followed by the addition of \n\naqueous cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide/bromide (100 g, 20 wt.%; 40% exchanged Br/OH; \n\nprepared by ion-exchange of CTMABr using Amberlite IRA-400 (OH)) and aqueous \n\ntetrapropylammonium hydroxide/bromide (30 g, 40 wt.%; 50% exchanged Br/OH). \n\nCTMAOH/Br was prepared as follows: CTMABr (50 g) was dissolved in 375 cm3 of Milli-Q \n\nwater (decarbonated at 100 \u00b0C for 25 min under N2). The resin AIRA-400 was pre-washed with  \n\n300 cm3 of Milli-Q water under stirring for 1 h. This procedure was repeated twice. Afterwards, \n\n300 cm3 of the washed resin (measured with a graduated cylinder) was added to the aqueous \n\nsolution of CTMABr (CTMABr (50 g)/Milli-Q water (375 cm3) under vigorous stirring for 24 h at a.t. \n\nFinally, the solution was separated from the resin with a cannula and the resin was further \n\nwashed following the same procedure described above. The solution was left to evaporate in air \n\nto concentrate. The -OH concentration was determined through titration with 0.1 M HCl \n\n(standard concentration: 0.10615 M). Thus, CTMABr/OH (20 cm3) was diluted to 100 cm3, and    \n\n25 cm3 were titrated with phenolphthalein as indicator.  \n\nTPAOH/Br was prepared from a mixture of TPABr (1.2 g) and TPAOH (3 g) in 4 cm3 of Milli-\n\nQ water under vigorous stirring at a.t. for 2 h). The resultant mixture possessed pH ? 13.5 and was \n\nheated at 80 \u00b0C with vigorous stirring for 16 h in order to facilitate the swelling of the layers of the \n\nprecursor material and the final pH was 11.9. The suspension was sonicated using an ultrasound \n\nbath (50 W, 50 Hz) during 1 h and after decantation, the supernatant colloid was separated. The \n\npH of the colloid was lowered to ca. 2.0 by adding 6 M HCl in order to facilitate the flocculation of \n\nthe delaminated solid.  \n\nThe solid was separated by centrifugation and washed with distilled water. After drying at \n\n60 \u00b0C for 12 h, the solid was calcined at 540 \u00b0C for 3 h under a flow of N2 (300 cm\n3.min-1), and then \n\nduring 6 h under air (300 cm3.min-1).22,23 The catalysts were manually ground using an agate pestle \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n144 \n \n\nand mortar and subsequently sieved to give a powder with particle sizes of less than 106 \u00b5m \n\nwidth.  \n\nAn ion-exchange/calcination procedure was applied to Na-MCM-22(24) and                     \n\nNa-MCM-22(38) to give H-MCM-22(24) and H-MCM-22(38), respectively. The ion-exchange \n\nprocedure consisted of suspending 1 g of the solid material in 15 cm3 of 1 M NH4NO3 and stirring \n\nthe resultant suspension for 24 h at 80 \u00b0C. The ion exchanged materials were washed throughly \n\nwith deionised water, dried at 50 \u00b0C overnight, and finally calcined in air at 540 \u00b0C (heating rate of        \n\n1 \u00b0C.min-1) for 6 h. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.5.

For each ZrW(X) material, three solutions were prepared: 50 cm3 of      \n\n0.5 M ZrOCl2.8H2O or ZrO(NO3)2.6H2O in deionised water (solution A), 1 dm\n3 of distilled water with \n\npH adjusted to 10 using an aqueous NH4OH solution (solution B), and 0.2 mmol of ammonium \n\nmetatungstate dissolved in 20 cm3 of solution B (solution C). Solution A was added drop-wise to \n\nsolution C, and the pH was adjusted to ca. 10 using a concentred solution of NH4OH (25 wt.% H2O, \n\nca. 13.3 M). The resultant slurries were hydrothermally treated in PTFE-lined stainless steel \n\nautoclaves heated at 195 \u00b0C for 24 h. Subsequently, the solids were filtered. In the case of ZrW(Cl) \n\nthe solid was washed with deionised water and the AgNO3 test was used to confirm the efficient \n\nremoval of Cl- ions. The prepared materials were dried overnight at 110 \u00b0C and then calcined \n\nunder air at 800 \u00b0C for 3 h (heating rate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1) , and finally ground using an agate pestle \n\nand mortar, and sieved to give particles of less than 150 \u00b5m width.  \n\nA zirconium material (denoted ZrO2) was prepared in a similar fashion but without adding \n\nthe tungsten precursor.  \n\nTwo mesoporous ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP materials were prepared via the incipient \n\nwetness impregnation method for introducing tungsten (and aluminium) on a pre-prepared \n\ntemplated zirconium hydroxide support (denoted Zr(template)). The Zr(template) solid was \n\nprepared by following the procedure described by Ciesla et al.25 (surfactant-based synthesis). A \n\nsolution of 70 wt.% of zirconium(IV) propoxide (Zr(O-nPr)4) in 1-propanol (11.34 cm\n3, 25.64 mmol) \n\nwas added slowly with stirring to a solution of HDTAMBr (5.0 g, 13.72 mmol) in a mixture of   \n\nMilli-Q water (230 g) and 37 wt.% of HCl (37.6 cm3, 457.9 mmol). After stirring for 30 min, a solid \n\nwas obtained, to which was added a solution of (NH4)2SO4 (3.40 g, 25.73 mmol) in Milli-Q water \n\n(46 g). The resultant mixture was stirred for 1 h, and then transferred to a polypropylene bottle \n\nand heated at 100 \u00b0C for 72 h. Finally, the suspension was filtered, and the solid washed \n\nconsecutively with deionised water (200 cm3), ethanol (200 cm3) and deionised water (200 cm3), \n\nfollowed by drying at 100 \u00b0C overnight to give Zr (template).  \n\nThe alumina-doped tungstated mesoporous zirconia (denoted ZrWAl-MP) was prepared \n\nas follows: a solution of ammonium metatungstate hydrate (0.213 g, 0.0668 mmol) and \n\naluminium nitrate nonahydrate (0.210 g, 0.560 mmol) in a mixture of Milli-Q water and ethanol \n\n(10 cm3, 1:1 v/v) was added drop-wise with stirring at 100 \u00b0C to Zr(template)(3.215 g).26 The drop-\n\nwise addition of small aliquots of the solution was alternated with partial drying of the solid at \n\n120 \u00b0C for 1 h. After all the solution had been added, the mixture was dried in an oven at 100 \u00b0C \n\nfor 24 h, and the solid was then calcined at 630 \u00b0C for 5 h (heating rate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1).  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n146 \n \n\nThe tungsten containing mesoporous zirconia (denoted ZrW-MP) was prepared using the \n\nprocedure described above for ZrWAl-MP: a solution of ammonium metatungstate hydrate  \n\n(0.150 g, 0.047 mmol) in a mixture of Milli-Q water and ethanol (10 cm3, 1:1 v/v) was added drop-\n\nwise with stirring at 100 \u00b0C to Zr(template) (1.332 g). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.6.

In particular, Al-TUD-1 was prepared as described previously \n\nin Section 2.1.2.10,12,13  \n\nCr-Al-TUD-1 was prepared using the following procedure: TEOS (17.3 g, 83.0 mmol) was \n\nadded to AIP (0.509 g, 2.5 mmol) and chromium nitrate (0.333 g, 0.8 mmol) dissolved in a mixture \n\nof isopropanol (6.5 cm3) and ethanol (6.5 cm3); atomic ratio Si/(Al+Cr)?25, Si/Cr?100, Si/Al?33. \n\nAfter stirring for 30 min, a mixture of TENA (12.5 g, 83 mmol) and Milli-Q water (5.09 g) was \n\n\n\nExperimental \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n147 \n\n \n\nadded, followed by addition of TEAOH (35 wt.% in Milli-Q water, 17.07 cm3, 41.5 mmol) under \n\nvigorous stirring. The clear gel obtained was stirred at a.t. for 24 h and dried at 98 \u00b0C for another \n\n24 h, followed by hydrothermal treatment in a PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave at 180 \u00b0C for 8 \n\nh. Finally, the solid was calcined at 600 \u00b0C in static air for 10 h (heating rate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1) to give a \n\nyellow powder.  \n\nTo prepare Cr-TUD-1, a solution of Cr(NO3)3.9H2O (0.38 g, 0.9 mmol) in Milli-Q water        \n\n(2 cm3) was added dropwise to TEOS (19.91 g, 95.6 mmol); atomic ratio Si/Cr?100. While stirring, \n\na solution of TENA (14.4 g, 96.5 mmol) in Milli-Q water (3.6 cm3) was added dropwise, followed by \n\nthe dropwise addition of TEAOH (35 wt.% in Milli-Q water, 19.7 cm3, 47.8 mmol). After stirring for \n\n2 h, a clear and pale green gel was obtained. The mixture was aged at a.t. for 24 h, dried at 100 \u00b0C \n\nfor another 24 h, and subsequently subjected to hydrothermal treatment in a stainless steel PTFE-\n\nlined autoclave at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h. Finally, the solid was calcined at 600 \u00b0C for 10 h in air (heating \n\nrate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1), to give a yellow powder. The prepared materials were manually ground using \n\nan agate pestle and mortar and subsequently sieved to give a powder with particle sizes of less \n\nthan 106 \u00b5m width. \n\n \n\n \n\nBEA, BEATUD-1, Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1 \n\n \n\n \n\nCommercial zeolite ammonia BEA powder (NH4-BEA, Zeolyst, CP814) was calcined at     \n\n550 \u00b0C (1 \u00b0C.min-1) in static air for 10 h, to give BEA. To prepare Cr-BEA, an aqueous suspension of \n\nNH4-BEA (2 g) in 200 cm\n3 of 0.01 M Cr(NO3)3.9H2O was stirred at 25 \u00b0C for 2 h. The solid was then \n\nfiltered and the ion-exchange procedure repeated twice. Finally, the exchanged solid was filtered, \n\nthoroughly washed with deionised water at 60 \u00b0C, and calcined at 500 \u00b0C for 6 h in air (with a \n\nheating rate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1). The final solid was a yellow powder.  \n\nThe composite BEATUD-1 was prepared as described previously in Section 2.1.3. using the \n\nBEA zeolite, 14,15 and a similar procedure was used to prepare the composite Cr-BEATUD-1. Firstly, \n\nBEA was ion-exchanged with chromium using the same procedure as that described above for   \n\nCr-BEA, excluding the final calcination step, giving a green powder. Subsequently, TEOS (5.34 g, \n\n0.025 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of this powder (1.00 g) in a mixture of \n\nTENA (83.85 g, 25 mmol) and Milli-Q water (2.99 g). Then, TEAOH (35 wt.% in Milli-Q water, 3.45 \n\ng, 7.5 mmol) was added to the suspension and stirring was continued for 2 h. The gel was aged at \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n148 \n \n\na.t. for 24 h, followed by drying at 100 \u00b0C for 24 h. The solid material was transferred to a PTFE-\n\nlined autoclave and heated at 180 \u00b0C for 8 h under static conditions. Finally, the solid was calcined \n\nat 600 \u00b0C for 10 h in air (heating rate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1). The final solid was a yellow powder. The \n\nprepared materials were manually ground using an agate pestle and mortar and subsequently \n\nsieved to give a powder with particle sizes of less than 106 \u00b5m width. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Characterisation of the catalysts \n\n \n\n \n\nICP-AES measurements for Si (with an error of ca. 7.2%), Al (error of ca. 6%), P (with an \n\nerror of ca. 10%), Zr and W (error &lt;10%) and Cr (with an error of ca. 5-10%) were carried out \n\nusing a Horiba Jobin Yvon modelo Activa M spectrometer (detection limit of ca. 20 \u00b5g.dm-3) at the \n\nCentral Laboratory for Analyses, University of Aveiro. Prior to the ICP-AES analyses, the samples \n\n(10 mg) were treated with 1 cm3 of HF and HNO3 and subjected to a microwave treatment. To the \n\nresultant solution was added distilled water until 100 cm3 of total volume.  \n\nC, N and S chemical analyses (for the IL [Emim]HSO4, Chapter 8) were performed using a \n\nLECO   CHNS-932 equipment based on infrared absorption detection method for C and S, and a \n\nthermal conductivity detection method for N. The gases used were helium (carrier), oxygen (for \n\ncombustion at furnace temperature of 1075 \u00b0C) and nitrogen (pneumatic) and the analysis time \n\nper sample was 4 min.  \n\nPowder XRD were collected for all samples at a.t. on a Philips X\u2019 Pert MPD diffractometer, \n\nequipped with an X\u2019Celerator detector, a graphite monochromator (Cu-K? X-radiation, ?=1.54060 \n\n\u00c5) and a flat plate sample holder, in a Bragg-Brentano para-focusing optics configuration (40 kV, \n\n50 mA). Samples were step-scanned in 0.04\u00b0 2? steps with a counting time of 6 s per step. \n\nElectron microscopies include high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) \n\nand scanning electron microscopy (SEM). HRTEM was carried out on Hitachi H9000 and JEOL \n\n2200FS instruments. Samples were prepared by spotting continuous (BEA, Chapter 5), holey \n\n(BEATUD-1, Chapter 5) or holey amorphous (Na-MCM-22(24) and ITQ-2(24), Chapter 6; Cr-BEA \n\nand Cr-BEATUD-1, Chapter 9) carbon film-coated 400 mesh copper grids (Agar Scientific, Stansted, \n\nUK) with a suspension of the solid sample in ethanol. SEM images were carried out on a Hitachi \n\nSU-70 UHR Schottky instrument for Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4) and (Na,H)-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) \n\n\n\nExperimental \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n149 \n\n \n\n(Chapter 6). In the case of ZrW(Cl), ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP, besides SEM images, EDX analyses \n\nand elemental mapping were carried out using a Bruker Quantax 400 (Chapter 7). \n\nThermal analyses (thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) \n\nwere also used in the characterisation of the tested catalysts. TGA and DSC were carried out \n\nunder air with a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C.min-1 for SAPOs (Chapter 3), Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4) and BEA \n\nand BEATUD-1 (Chapter 5), and a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C.min-1 for (Na,H)-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) \n\n(Chapter 6), ZrW(Cl), ZrW(NO3), ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP (Chapter 7) and Cr-containing materials \n\n(Cr-Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1, Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1, Chapter 9), using Shimadzu TGA-50 and DSC-50 \n\nsystems. \n\nThe textural parameters were determined from the N2 adsorption isotherms measured at \n\n-196 \u00b0C, using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument for Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4) and BEA, BEATUD-1 \n\nand TUD-1 (Chapter 5), and a Micromeritics instrument Corp Germini model 2380 for (Na,H)-\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6), ZrW(Cl), ZrW(NO3), ZrW-MP, ZrWAl-MP and ZrO2 (Chapter 7), \n\nand Cr-containing materials (Cr-Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1, Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1, Chapter 9). Before \n\nthe measurements the samples were outgassed at 350 \u00b0C, under vacuum for Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4) \n\nand BEA, BEATUD-1 and TUD-1 (Chapter 5) or at 250 \u00b0C for (Na,H)-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) \n\n(Chapter 6), ZrW(Cl), ZrW(NO3), ZrW-MP, ZrWAl-MP and ZrO2 (Chapter 7) and Cr-containing \n\nmaterials (Cr-Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1, Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1, Chapter 9). The textural properties \n\ninclude microporous volume (Vmicro, t-plot method) for SAPOs (Chapter 3), BEA (Chapter 5) and \n\n(Na,H)-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6); total pore volume (Vp), using the Gurvitch equation for \n\nrelative pressure (p/p0)? 0.98 for Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4), BEA, BEATUD-1 and TUD-1 (Chapter 5), \n\nZrW(Cl), ZrW(NO3), ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP (Chapter 7) and Cr-containing materials (Cr-Al-TUD-1, \n\nCr-TUD-1, Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1, Chapter 9); microporous external specific surface area (SEXT,  \n\nt-plot method) for SAPOs (Chapter 3), BEA (Chapter 5), (Na,H)-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6) \n\nand Cr-BEA (Chapter 9); BET specific surface area (SBET, calculated for relative pressures (p/p0) in \n\nthe range 0.01-0.10 for Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4), BEA, BEATUD-1 and TUD-1 (Chapter 5), (Na,H)-\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6), ZrW(Cl), ZrW(NO3), ZrW-MP, ZrWAl-MP and ZrO2 (Chapter 7) \n\nand in the range 0.02-0.10 for Cr-containing materials (Cr-Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1, Cr-BEA and Cr-\n\nBEATUD-1, Chapter 9); and pore width (Dp) corresponding to the maximum of the BJH pore size \n\ndistribution curve (PSD) calculated from the adsorption branch of the isotherm  for Al-TUD-1 \n\n(Chapter 4), BEATUD-1 and TUD-1 (Chapter 5), ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6), ZrW(Cl), ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-\n\nMP (Chapter 7) and Cr-containing materials (Cr-Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1 and Cr-BEATUD-1, Chapter 9). \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n150 \n \n\nSolid state NMR (e.g. 27Al magic-angle spinning MAS NMR and 13C CP MAS NMR) was \n\nemployed. 27Al MAS NMR spectra were measured at 104.26 MHz with a Bruker Avance 400 (9.4 T) \n\nspectrometer, using a contact time of 0.6 \u00b5s, a recycle delay of 0.8 s, and a spinning rate of 15 kHZ \n\nfor Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4), BEA and BEATUD-1 (Chapter 5), (Na,H)-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter \n\n6). Chemical shifts are quoted in ppm from Al(H2O)6\n3+. The 13C CP MAS NMR spectrum of the used \n\nBEA catalyst (washed with methanol and dried overnight at 65 \u00b0C) was collected at 100.613 MHz \n\non a 9.4 T Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer with 3.5 \u00b5s 1H 90\u00b0 pulses, a contact time of 1.5 ms, a \n\nspinning rate of 9.0 kHz, and recycle delays of 4 s (Chapter 5).  \n\nOther spectroscopies used include Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), attenuated total \n\nreflectance (ATR), Raman and diffuse reflectance UV-vis (DR UV-vis). IR spectra were collected on \n\na FT-IR Unican Mattson-7000 infrared spectrophotometer using KBr pellets for BEA and BEATUD-1 \n\n(Chapter 5), H-MCM-22(24) and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6). ATR FT-IR spectra were measured on a \n\nMattson 7000 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a Specac Golden Gate Mk II ATR accessory \n\nhaving a diamond top-plate and KRS-5 focusing lenses for Cr-containing materials (Cr-AlTUD-1, Cr-\n\nTUD-1, Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1). The Raman spectra were recorded on a Bruker RFS FT-Raman \n\nspectrophotometer (100 s-1, ?=1064 nm, 200-5000 scans with a resolution of 4 cm-1) for ZrW(Cl), \n\nZrW(NO3), ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP (Chapter 7). DR UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Jasco V-\n\n560 spectrophotometer and BaSO4 as reference for Cr-containing materials (Cr-AlTUD-1, Cr-TUD-\n\n1, Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1, Chapter 9). \n\nAcid properties are an important issue in the characterisation of the catalysts. It has been \n\nreported in the literature for dehydration reactions in aqueous solutions with solid acid catalysts \n\nthat gas-phase characterisation of acid sites (AS) can be used for investigating the influence of the \n\nacid properties of solid acid catalysts and to predict catalytic activity in the aqueous phase.27,28 \n\nThe acid properties of SAPOs (Chapter 3), Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4), BEA and BEATUD-1 (Chapter 5), \n\nH-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6), ZrW(Cl), ZrW(NO3), ZrW-MP, ZrWAl-MP (Chapter 7) were \n\nmeasured at IST, Lisbon by the group of Professor Filipa Ribeiro, using a Nexus-Thermo Nicolet  \n\nFT-IR instrument (64 scans and resolution of 4 cm-1) equipped with a specially designed cell, using \n\nself-supported discs (5-10 mg.cm-2) and pyridine as the basic probe molecule. Pyridine was chosen \n\nbecause its critical dimension of ca. 6.43 \u00c529 is comparable with the molecular dimensions of       \n\nD-xylose (6.8 \u00c5 along the longest axis).30 After in situ outgassing at 450 \u00b0C for 3 h at 10-6 mbar (for \n\nSAPOs (Chapter 3), Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4), BEA and BEATUD-1 (Chapter 5), H-MCM-22 and ITQ-\n\n2(24) (Chapter 6) and at 400 \u00b0C for 2 h at 10-5 mbar for ZrW(Cl), ZrW(NO3), ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP \n\n(Chapter 7)), pyridine (99.99%) was contacted with the sample at 150 \u00b0C for 10 min and then \n\n\n\nExperimental \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n151 \n\n \n\nevacuated at 150 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C for SAPOs (Chapter 3), Al-TUD-1 (Chapter 4), BEA and BEATUD-1 \n\n(Chapter 5) and ZrW(Cl), ZrW(NO3), ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP (Chapter 7) for 30 min or 150 \u00b0C for H-\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6) for 30 min under vacuum at 10-6 mbar (in the case of ZrW(X) \n\nmaterials the vaccum applied was 10-5 mbar). The IR bands at ca. 1540 and 1455 cm-1 are related \n\nto pyridine adsorbed on Br\u00f6nsted acid sites (B) and Lewis acid sites (L), respectively 31-33 and were \n\nused for quantification.33 In the case of H-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6), the acid properties \n\nwere investigated by FT-IR studies using collidine (2,4,6-trimethylpyridine) as probe molecule: the \n\nFT-IR spectra were recorded with a resolution of 2 cm-1 on a Nicolet Nexus spectrophotometer \n\nequipped with an MCT (mercury cadmium telluride) detector. Similar to the procedure applied for \n\nthe analysis with pyridine, the powdered solids were pressed into self-supported disks                 \n\n(10 mg.cm-2) and placed in a quartz IR cell with KBr windows. After in situ outgassing at 450 \u00b0C for \n\n4 h, collidine was contacted with the sample at 200 \u00b0C for 30 min and then evacuated at 200 \u00b0C for \n\nfurther 30 min under vacuum. The IR band at ca. 1635 cm-1 is related to collidine adsorbed on B. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.

Aqueous \u2013phase reaction systems \n\n \n\n \n\nThe catalytic tests were performed under nitrogen (autogeneous pressure) in batch \n\ntubular glass micro-reactors (total capacity of ca. 5 cm3) with pear-shaped bottom and equipped \n\nwith a valve for gas purging and a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (Chapters 3-7). Prior to the \n\ncatalytic reaction, the reaction mixture was stirred at a.t. for ca. 1 min to completely dissolve the \n\nsaccharide in the aqueous phase and then it was immersed in a thermostatically controlled oil \n\nbath. The instant the reaction began (zero time) was taken as the instant that the micro-reactor \n\nwas immersed in the oil bath. Each sample was taken from an individual batch run experiment.   \n\nTypically, the dehydration of the saccharides was carried out at 170 \u00b0C, using a biphasic \n\nsolvent system (1 cm3 total volume) consisting of Milli-Q water and toluene (0.3:0.7 v/v, Figure \n\n2.1). The biphasic solvent system is interesting for the simultaneous separation of Fur/Hmf from \n\nthe aqueous phase as it is formed.34,35 The reaction of the saccharides takes place in the aqueous \n\nphase (where they dissolve completely) and the product Fur or Hmf is transferred into the organic \n\nphase, avoiding undesired reactions.36 The saccharides tested in the biphasic solvent systems \n\nwere (monosaccharides) D-xylose (100 g.dm-3, 0.67 M) in Chapters 3-8, D-fructose and D-glucose \n\n(100 g.dm-3, 0.56 M) in Chapter 4, (disaccharides) D-sucrose, D-maltose and D-cellobiose (100 \n\ng.dm-3, 0.29 M), and (polysaccharides) D-xylan, inulin and starch (33.3 g.dm-3) in Chapter 4.

Identification of the reaction products \n\n \n\n \n\nIn order to identify possible by-products present in the aqueous-phase, 1H NMR and 13C \n\nNMR spectra in the liquid state were employed for the reaction solution after the reaction of D-\n\nxylose in the presence of BEA (Chapter 5) and ITQ-2(24) (Chapter 6), and for the solvent used for \n\nwashing the catalyst BEA (Chapter 5). These spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 300 MHz \n\nspectrometer at 20 \u00b0C. The chemical shifts are quoted in parts per million from tetramethylsilane, \n\nTMS. The identification of the by-products present in the organic phase was performed by using \n\ngas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) applied in a Trace GC 2000 Series (Thermo \n\nQuest CE Instruments)-DSQ-II (Thermo Scientific)) equipped with a capillary column (DB-1MS,     \n\n30 m x  0.32 mm), using He as carrier gas (Chapter 8). \n\n In Chapter 7, solid-phase microextraction coupled with comprehensive 2 D gas \n\nchromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SPME/GCxGC-ToFMS) analyses were \n\ncarried out for the liquid phase of the reaction mixture (after separating the solid phase by \n\ncentrifugation) on the same day that the respective catalytic test was perfomed. The vial \n\ncontaining the reaction solution was immersed in a thermostated bath adjusted to 40.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C \n\nfor 5 min. Then, a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) device with a fused silica fibre coating \n\n(50/30 \u00b5m divinylbenzene-carboxen-poly(dimethylsiloxane)) was immersed in the reaction \n\nsolution for 20 min. After the extraction/concentration step, the SPME coating fibre was manually \n\nintroduced into the GCxGC-ToFMS injection port at 250 \u00b0C and kept for 30 s for desorption. The \n\ninjection port was lined with a 0.75 mm I.D. splitless glass liner and splitless injections were used \n\n(30 s). The LECO Pegasus 4 D (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) GCxGC-ToFMS system consisted of an \n\nAgilent GC 7890A gas chromatograph with a dual stage jet cryogenic modulator (licensed from \n\nZoex) and a secondary oven. The detector was a high-speed time of flight (ToF) mass \n\nspectrometer.

Total ion chromatograms (TIC) were processed using the \n\nautomated data processing software ChromaToF (LECO) at signal-to-noise threshold of 100. \n\nContour plots were used to evaluate the separation general quality and for manual peak \n\nidentification; a signal-to-noise threshold of 50 was used. Two commercial databases (Wiley 275 \n\nand US National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) V 2.0-Mainlib and Replib) were used. \n\nThe majority (86%) of the identified products showed mass spectral similarity matches > 850. \n\nFurthermore, a manual inspection of the mass spectra was done, combined with the use of \n\nadditional data, such as the retention index (RI) value, which was determined according to the \n\nVan den Dool and Kratz RI equation.37 For the determination of the RI, a C8-C20 n-alkanes series \n\nwas used, and as some volatile compounds were eluted before C8, the solvent n-hexane was used \n\nas C6 standard. The experimentally calculated RI values were compared, when available, with \n\nvalues reported in the literature for similar chromatographic columns employed as the first \n\ndimension. The results were analysed qualitatively and thus the relative amounts of the products \n\nwere not considered. \n\nIn the case of the recovered humins in Chapter 8, the solid state 13C NMR spectrum was \n\nrecorded at 11.75 T on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer operating at 125.76 MHz, using a 4 mm BL \n\nCP MAS VTN probe. The sample was spun at 9.0 kHz and the contact time was 8 ms.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.6.

Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nTwo of the most commonly studied types of microporous solid acids are zeolites \n\n(aluminosilicates) and silicoaluminophosphates (SAPOs), which are important aluminosilicate-\n\nbased zeolites.2-5 SAPOs can be briefly defined as molecular structures that consist of tetrahedral \n\noxides of silicon, aluminium and phosphorous forming Si-O-Al, P-O-Al and Si-O-Si but no Si-O-P \n\nbonds.6 The discovery of SAPOs appeared through aluminophosphates (AlPO). The first report on \n\naluminophosphates (AlPO) is dated from 1982 by Wilson.7,8 Since then, the synthesis of these \n\nmaterials has been widely studied and a wide range of these types of materials has been \n\ndeveloped.9-11 Microporous AlPO structures have an alternation of Al3+ and P5+ ions. These ions \n\ncan be isomorphically replaced by heteroatoms through substitution mechanisms (Figure 3.1). A \n\ntypical mechanism is the replacement of Al3+ by a divalent metal leading to a negatively charged \n\nframework which is compensated by the organic cationic molecules that act as structure directing \n\nagents.9 However, Si4+ can also be incorporated in AlPO networks, giving origin to SAPOs in \n\n1984.7,12 The incorporation of silicon can be employed by two different substitution \n\nmechanisms:13,14 By substitution of phosphorous (SM2 substitution mechanism) or of an \n\naluminium-phosporous pair (SM3 substitution mechanism, Figure 3.1).10,15 The SM2 mechanism \n\nconsists of the substitution of P5+ for Si4+ in the AlPO4 frameworks leading to the appearance of a \n\nnegative charge per each silicon ion which is balanced by the positive charge of the organic \n\nmolecules inside the micropores, or protons at the Si-O-Al bridges (originating Br\u00f6nsted acidity in \n\nthe latter case).9,10 The SM2 mechanism gives an environment of a silicon atom surrounded by \n\nfour aluminium atoms in the second coordination sphere (Si(OAl)4).\n9 The amount of silicon \n\nincorporated via SM2 is limited and above certain silicon contents, both mechanisms occur.9,10,15 \n\nThe incorporation of two Si4+ occurs via the substitution of a pair of aluminium and phosphorous \n\nions and no charge is formed. Due to the instability of Si-O-P bonds (based on a computational \n\nstudy on SAPO-5),16 this mechanism is always accompanied to a certain extent by SM2 which \n\nprevents the formation of those unstable bonds.9 Therefore the coexistence of the SM3 and SM2 \n\nmechanisms is able to generate isolated pairs of silicon atoms with Si in Si (1Si3Al) and Si (1Si3P) \n\nconfigurations,17 leading to extended Si islands (silica domains) in the AlPO network, and various \n\nacid environments (Si(OAl)n(OSi)4-n (1<n<3)) located at the border of the Si island (in the interface \n\nbetween the islands and the Al-O-P framework). The size and concentration of the Si islands \n\ndepend on the extension of SM3 to SM2;9 their formation is thermodynamically favoured because \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n166 \n\n \n\nhigh temperatures in SAPO molecular sieves promote a solid-state transformation due to the \n\nmobility of atoms (isolated silicon atoms migrate to form silicon islands in the framework).18 \n\nAlthough a higher number of acid sites (AS) are generated through the SM2 mechanism, the SM3 \n\ngives less amount but stronger AS that increase as the value of n in those environments decreases \n\nand as the island size increases.10,19 SM1 is another possible mechanism of silicon insertion which \n\nimplies the substitution of aluminium for silicon, but it is not a favourable mechanism due to the \n\nformation of the unstable Si-O-P bridges.10  \n\n \n\nP\n\nO\n\nAl\n\nO\n\nO\n\nAl\n\nAl\n\nO\n\nAl\n\nO\nP\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nP\n\nP\n\nSi\nO\n\nAl\n\nO\n\nO\n\nAl\n\nO\n\nAl\n\nO\nP\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nP\n\nP\n\nH Al\n\n+ S\ni\n4+ + H\n\n+\n\n- P\n5+\n\nSM\n2\n\nSi\nO\n\nSi\n\nO\n\nO\n\nAl\n\nO\n\nAl\n\nO\nP\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nP\n\nP\n\nAl\n\n+\n2\n\nSi 4+\n- P 5+\n\n- Al 3 +\n\nSM\n3\n\nP\n\nO\n\nSi\n\nO\n\nO\n\nAl\n\nO\n\nAl\n\nO\nP\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nP\n\nP\n\nAl\n\n+\nSi 4\n\n+\n- A\n\nl 3+\n\nS\nM\n\n1\n\n \n\nFigure  3.1-  SM1, SM2 and SM3 mechanism in the transformation of AlPOs to SAPOS [adapted \n\nfrom 10]. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn terms of catalysis, the SAPO-type materials are considered to be middly acidic, since \n\nthey are more acidic than the corresponding AlPO4 systems but less than acid zeolites.\n7 However, \n\nsince the control of the acidity of these materials can be controlled by the different mechanisms, \n\nthe acidity of SAPOs is sometimes considered to be more tuneable than that of zeolites,10,20 which \n\nis very desirable for designing new and efficient catalysts for specific reactions.21,22 The \n\n\n\n  Silicoaluminophosphates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n____________________________________________________________________________ \n167 \n\n \n\nintroduction of silica into the aluminophosphate structure induces ion exchange capacity and \n\ncatalytic activity.23 Therefore SAPOs are acid catalysts with very interesting properties and \n\npotential industrial applications. They have already been investigated in the isomerisation of \n\nxylene,24-26 transalkylation,27 isomerisation of 1-pentene,28 isopropylation of benzene,29 methanol-\n\nto-hydrocarbons reaction,30 and to olefins (MTO),31-33  n-alkane cracking and hydrocracking,20,21 \n\noligomerisation of propylene,34 oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes,17 transformation of \n\nalkanes,35-37 and other complex hydrocarbon transformations.38  \n\nIn a study of zeolites with different framework types (BEA, FAU, MFI and MOR) as \n\ncatalysts for the dehydration of monosaccharides, favourable shape selective effects were \n\nreported for H-Mordenite (MOR), which possesses sufficiently large channels (6.5x7.0 \u00c5) running \n\nin one direction.39,40 Besides, it is known that the size control of SAPOs is crucial to improve the \n\ncatalytic activity and lifetime of the catalysts.11,41 These findings were relevant to screen the \n\ncatalytic performance of SAPOs containing medium or large pore channels, namely SAPO-5, SAPO-\n\n11 and SAPO-40, in the dehydration of Xyl to Fur. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.1.

Therefore, SAPO-5 possesses the topology \n\nof AlPO4-5 with the same framework structure,\n26,42 which is of AFI type with a hexagonal \n\nsymmetry and 1 D channels (according to the International Zeolite Association, Figure 3.2).43-45 \n\nThe AFI framework is composed of aluminium, phosporous and oxygen.46 SAPO-5 is obtained by \n\nreplacing at least two phosphorous atoms per unit cell in the AFI framework,26,47,48 being \n\ncomposed of alternating four and six-membered rings (4-MR and 6-MR) as secondary building \n\nunits with a P6cc space group (which is a space group characteristic of hexagonal crystal systems  \n\nwith a C6v point group that has 6 fold rotation axis and 6 minor vertical plane groups m containing \n\nthe axis of rotation).21 The pore system consists of non-connected parallel channels of 12-MR \n\n(interconnected by 6-ring windows).26,42 Furthermore, in SAPO-5 each 12-MR channel is circular \n\nwith pore openings of (7.3x7.3 \u00c5).42 Accordingly to IUPAC, 12-MR pore apertures, SAPO-5 \n\npossesses a large pore structure.49-51  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n168 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2- AFI framework type viewed along [001]\n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.2.

In the case of the SAPO-11 samples, the higher YFur (at 100% CXyl) was \n\nreached for the sample possessing smaller particle sizes and higher L/B ratio (Table 3.2).  Usually \n\nhigher catalytic activity correlated with higher total acidity. An exception is SAPO-40 which was \n\nessentially a Br\u00f6nsted acid catalyst and possessed the highest total acidity, which did not \n\ncorrelate with its lower catalytic activity compared to the remaining SAPO samples, possibly due \n\nto differences in pore structure and surface polarity (competitive adsorption effects) and rate of \n\ncatalyst deactivation by coking (catalyst surface passivation and partial pore blockage).  A similar \n\n63% YFur was reported for the aqueous-phase reaction of Xyl (with an initial concentration of    \n\n0.05 M) in the presence of 0.03 M of H2SO4 at 250 \u00b0C.\n114 Under similar reaction conditions to those \n\nused in the present study, H2SO4 (0.03 M) gave 2% SFur at 98% CXyl within 4 h of reaction. For SAPO \n\nsamples, factors which may favour Fur production are shape selectivity, acid properties (e.g. L/B \n\nratio, discussed in the previous Section) and competitive adsorption effects.

In the liquid phase the solute \n\ndiffuses as a solute-solvent assemblage and catalyst-solvent interactions may reduce the effective \n\ndiffusivity of Xyl within the liquid-filled pores of the SAPO materials. On the other hand, diffusivity \n\ndepends on factors such as reaction temperature and viscosity of the fluid, and diffusion may be \n\nfacilitated at higher temperatures.

As \n\ncould be expected (since the specific surface areas were comparable), a similar trend was \n\nobserved for rates calculated at the same time points on the basis of the catalyst mass       \n\n(\u00b5mol.h-1.gcat\n-1): SAPO-5 (41; 17) &lt;SAPO-11a (111; 37) ? SAPO-11b (111; 35). Although SAPO-40 \n\npossessed the highest total acidity and the highest number of moderate+strong AS (those \n\nretaining pyridine at 350 \u00b0C), as well as the highest SBET, SEXT  and Vmicro, the reaction rate (on the \n\nbasis of  the mass of catalyst) was comparable with that observed for SAPO-5. Given the \n\ncomplexity of the catalytic systems it is difficult to correlate the different reaction rates with the \n\nstrengths and densities of the AS for the different framework structures, and it is thus preferable \n\nto restrict the correlations to a specific structure type, as discussed above for SAPO-11. \n\nThe observed increase in the Fur selectivity with conversion for all the catalysts has been \n\nnoted with other solid acid catalysts (exfoliated nanosheets,125 layered zeolite Nu-6(1),115 micro \n\nand mesoporous sulfonic acids,117 micro and mesoporous niobium silicates,118  mesoporous silica \n\nsupported catalysts,126 modified sulfated zirconium116). The complex reaction mechanism of the \n\nconversion of Xyl to Fur involves a series of elementary steps, and the primary step of the reaction \n\n\n\n  Silicoaluminophosphates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n____________________________________________________________________________ \n181 \n\n \n\nof Xyl is possibly not rate limiting.114,127 On the other hand, the influence of competitive \n\nadsorption effects and changes in the surface properties of the catalysts during the reaction \n\ncannot be ruled out. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2. Catalyst stability \n\n \n\n \n\nThe SFur was always less than 100% (until 100% CXyl) and the originally white powders \n\nturned light brown during the reactions. No by-products were detected by gas (GC-MS of the \n\ntoluene phase) or liquid (with a differential refractive index detector and an UV diode-array \n\ndetection mode for the aqueous phase) chromatography, possibly because they were essentially \n\ninsoluble and \u201cnon-volatile\u201d organic compounds which were responsible for the brown colour. For \n\nthe SAPO-11 materials the amount of this insoluble matter formed after 16 h reaction was \n\nestimated by removing all solids from the reaction medium by centrifugation, washing with \n\nmethanol and a 50% v/v mixture of water and ethanol, drying at 65 \u00b0C and subsequently weighing \n\nand subtracting from the initial amount of catalyst. The \u201cexcess\u201d weight corresponded to ca. 20 \n\nwt.% of the initial amount of Xyl. Using this result, the material mass balance nearly closed: (wt.% \n\nsolid by-products)+ (wt.% YFur)= (20 wt.%) + (39-42 wt.%)=59-61 wt.% Fur, compared with the     \n\n64 wt.% theoretical yield. \n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses of the fresh and used solids showed \n\nendothermic bands below 200 \u00b0C assigned to physisorbed water and volatiles. Above 200 \u00b0C, all \n\nthe used catalysts exhibited exothermic bands not presented by the original catalysts (Figure 3.12 \n\nrepresents the curves for the two SAPO-11 samples).A small exothermic curve at ca. 330 \u00b0C \n\nappears for the unused catalysts (two SAPO-11 samples) which may be due to organic template \n\nwhich was not completely removed during the preparation procedures. TGA analyses of used \n\ncatalysts in the temperature range of 200-550 \u00b0C indicated weight losses of 2.8-5.1%, confirming \n\nthe presence of organic by-products in the washed and dried solids. The specific surface areas of \n\nthe used/washed/dried SAPO-11 materials decreased significantly by a factor of ca.12. When the \n\nwashed/dried SAPO-11a was used in a second run of the Xyl reaction, the YFur at 4 h decreased ca. \n\n10%.  Hence, the efficient regeneration of the SAPOs required removal of the organic matter, \n\nwhich may be accomplished by thermal treatment under air to promote the complete oxidation \n\nof the carbonaceous matter.  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n182 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.12- DSC curves for the two SAPO-11 samples, fresh and after 4 h of reaction: SAPO-11a \n\nfresh (pink); SAPO-11a recovered (red); SAPO-11b fresh (green); SAPO-11b recovered (blue). \n\nReaction conditions: 0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v) biphasic solvent system, 170 \u00b0C, 20 gcat.dm\n-3, 0.67 M Xyl. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe stability of the catalysts was further investigated by applying a thermal treatment     \n\n(1 \u00b0C.min-1 until 450 \u00b0C for 3 h, under air) after washing/drying the materials and prior to their \n\nreuse; three consecutive 4 h batch runs were performed for each sample. No significant decrease \n\nin the yield of Fur and in the conversion of Xyl was observed for any of the samples in the three \n\nconsecutive runs (Figures 3.13 and 3.14 respectively). The powder XRD patterns of the fresh and \n\nrecovered catalysts were quite similar indicating that the respective crystalline structures are \n\npreserved (Figure 3.5). ICP-AES analyses for the recovered SAPO-5, SAPO-11b and SAPO-40 \n\nsamples showed no decrease in Si, P or Al contents (experimental error: ca. 10%). Hence the SAPO \n\nsolid acids seem to be fairly stable under the reaction conditions used. \n\n \n\n\n\n  Silicoaluminophosphates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n____________________________________________________________________________ \n183 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13- Yields of 2-furaldehyde (YFur) in recycling runs in the presence of the SAPOs samples \n\n(4 h, 170 \u00b0C): Run 1-black bar, run 2-orange bar, run 3-green bar.

Conclusions \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this work it has been demonstrated that medium pore and large pore SAPO molecular \n\nsieves can be used as recyclable solid acids for the dehydration of Xyl into Fur under aqueous-\n\norganic biphasic conditions. The similar reaction rate for the SAPO-11 materials correlated with \n\nthe similar total acidity, and the differences in Fur selectivities may be partly due to the difference \n\nin the L/B ratio. Although the SAPO-11 system seems to be the most promising in this study \n\n(giving YFur at 4 h of 34-38%, comparable with the H-Mordenite zeolite with Si/Al ? 6), it is possible \n\nthat others exhibit superior catalytic performances. On the other hand, for a specific SAPO \n\nmaterial, the catalytic performance may be fine-tuned, based on detailed systematic \n\ninvestigations of the effects of the preparation method, crystallinity, morphology, silicon content \n\nand acidity on the catalytic performances: these studies may also provide insights into the factors \n\nthat influence the target versus undesired reaction pathways (selectivity). When compared with \n\nother solid acids investigated previously (namely Nb-MCM-41,118 cesium salts of 12-\n\ntungstophosphoric acid and mesoporous silica-supported 12-tungstophosphoric acid,126,128 bulk \n\nand mesostructured sulfated zirconium,116 the investigated SAPO materials presented superior \n\nstability towards leaching (were more water-tolerant) when tested in the same reaction under \n\ncomparable reaction conditions. When moving from monosaccharides to (bulkier molecules) \n\ndi/polysaccharides as substrates, diffusion inside the microporous may be severely hindered. In \n\nthis sense, the use of mesoporous solid acids as catalysts for the conversion of saccharides to \n\nfuranic aldehydes may be preferable. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4.

Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nOf the studied catalysts, microporous zeolites or zeotype materials (such as the SAPOs \n\nsamples studied in the previous Chapter) are quite promising.2-5 However, the transformation of \n\nrelatively bulky saccharides may be hindered in a microporous structure because the accessibility \n\nof the pores is limited to small molecules. Hence there was an increased interest in obtaining \n\nmolecular sieves with larger pore sizes and the use of mesoporous aluminosilicates may be \n\npreferable.6  The discovery of nanostructured mesoporous materials (M41S) came about with the \n\nintroduction of supramolecular assemblies as templating agents by Mobil Oil researchers.7-9 The \n\nso-called M41S materials possess high specific surface areas and pore volumes with a uniform and \n\nordered arrangement of mesopores, and controllable pore size distributions between 2 and        \n\n10 nm and the pore walls are made of amorphous silica.9 These features make them interesting \n\ncandidates as catalysts or catalyst supports.  \n\n The first synthesis of a mesoporous silicate with a regular arrangement of pores was \n\nobtained in 1992 by the Mobil Oil Corporation.9 This material is known as MCM-41 (Mobil \n\nComposition of Matter number 41). It has an ordered mesostructure with 1 D hexagonal porous \n\narrangement. It is the most widely studied of the M41S family of materials (Figure 4.1). Many \n\nother types of mesoporous materials have since then been described, such as cubic MCM-48 \n\n(Figure 4.2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                                                 A \n\nFigure 4.1- Representative structure of MCM-41.10 \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n196 \n \n\n     \n\n                                                                                   B  \n \nFigure 4.2- Representative structure of MCM-48.11                                                                  \n \n\n \n\nThe choice of the organic template is a key step in the synthesis of porous materials. In \n\nthe case of mesoporous oxides it usually consists of supramolecular arrays such as micellar \n\nsystems formed by surfactants or block copolymers as structure-directing agents.8,9  Economic \n\nand environmental concerns have motivated the search for low-cost and non-surfactant \n\ntemplating routes to mesoporous materials. An important discovery was the straightforward \n\nsynthesis of the 3 D mesoporous (siliceous) oxide TUD-1 (Technische Universital Delft), which was \n\nfirstly synthesised by Shan et al.12 in 2000.  \n\nTUD-1 can be synthesised using a silica source, water and a small and non-surfactant \n\norganic template (either triethanolamine (TENA) or tetraethyleneglycol as organic templates).13 \n\nThe synthesis involves the polycondensation of inorganic species upon a temperature increase. \n\nCare must be taken regarding the intermolecular interaction among organic templates and \n\ninorganic species in order to have a successful formation of mesopores. For this purpose, the type \n\nof template must match with the temperature range used.14  Jansen et al.14 characterised TUD-1 \n\nas a well-defined porous material with a pore size distribution (25-250 \u00c5 in diameter), 3 D \n\nconnectivities with a sponge-like or worm-like pore structure, high specific surface area (ca.     \n\n1000 m2.g-1) and high thermal and hydrothermal stability (at least until 1000 \u00b0C for 2 h). These \n\nfeatures allow the access of bulky reagents to active acid sites (AS) and make TUD-1 a promising \n\nmaterial for catalytic applications.13 The high specific surface area, pore volume and pore width of \n\nTUD-1 and related materials coupled with the 3 D mesoporous channel system, may facilitate a \n\n\n\nAl-TUD-1 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n197 \n\n \n\nrelatively faster diffusion of molecules inside the channels, compared to 1 D pore systems in \n\nmaterials such as MCM-41.8  \n\nThe purely siliceous TUD-1 may be furnished with Br\u00f6nsted (B) and Lewis (L) acidity \n\nand/or redox properties by the incorporation of different metals into the framework,15 via a     \n\none-pot procedure based on the sol-gel technique.16-21 Some examples of such materials are: \n\ntitanosilica (Ti-TUD-1),22-28 Co-TUD-1,23,29-34 Zr-TUD-1,20,35-37 Al-TUD-1,16-18,20,21,37-40 Cu-TUD-1,41  Fe-\n\nTUD-1,23,31,42-44 Cr-TUD-1,23,45 Mn-TUD-1,46,47  Mo-TUD-1,48 V-TUD-1,49,50 Hf-TUD-1,51 Ga-TUD-1,52,53 \n\nPd-TUD-1,54 and Ce-TUD-1,55  or yet bimetallic incorporation, such as Al-Zr-TUD-1.15 The high \n\ndegree of framework incorporation is due to the use of a TENA in the synthesis of TUD-1, forming \n\natrane complexes with different metals (M) which guarantees the incorporation as isolated \n\nmetals instead of metal oxide clusters.15,48 Different metals acted similarly in the synthesis of \n\nseveral M-TUD-1 (M=metal).15-18,20-55  In this Chapter, aluminium-containing mesoporous TUD-1 \n\n(denoted as Al-TUD-1) was investigated as a solid acid catalyst in the acid-catalysed conversion of \n\nsaccharides to Fur and Hmf, at 170 \u00b0C. The substrates used were D-xylose, D-fructose and             \n\nD-glucose as typical monosaccharides, D-sucrose and D-cellobiose as examples of disaccharides, \n\nand D-xylan (a polymer composed mainly of D-xylose units) and inulin (a polymer of D-fructose \n\nunits) as polysaccharides. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.

The spectrum obtained was very similar to that \n\ndescribed before for Al-TUD-1 with Si/Al=4, prepared using TENA as the template,21 and for Al-\n\nTUD-1(30).60 It was possible to observe the presence of aluminium species with tetrahedral \n\ncoordination due to the existence of a strong resonance at ?=53 ppm and hexacoordinated \n\naluminium due to the presence of a high-field signal at ?=0 ppm (Figure 4.7). An additional signal \n\nat ?=31 ppm was attributed to pentacoordinated species for Al-TUD-1 with Si/Al=4.18 Anand et \n\nal.16 also obtained this third peak in an Al-TUD-1 with Si/Al=25, which they attributed to \n\npentacoordinated aluminium or highly distorted tetrahedral sites. Other authors have reported \n\nthe co-existence of the three types of aluminium species.16,39 These species might also be present \n\nin the Al-TUD-1 sample studied, as there is an enlargement of the peak that appears at ?=53 ppm, \n\nwhich can overlap the signals due to pentacoordinated aluminium species.  \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7-  27Al MAS NMR spectrum of Al-TUD-1. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe acid properties of Al-TUD-1 were measured by adsorption of pyridine followed by FT-\n\nIR spectroscopy as explained before in Section 3.2.1.2 in Chapter 3, and [B] (band at 1545 cm-1) \n\nand [L] (band at 1450 cm-1) were quantified according to equations 3.1 and 3.2 described therein. \n\nThe sample of Al-TUD-1 showed both L and B interacting with pyridine after outgassing at 150 \u00b0C \n\n(Table 4.2). \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n202 \n \n\nTable 4.2- Acid properties of Al-TUD-1 measured by FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine and comparison \n\nwith literature data. \n\nSample (Si/Al) [L]\na\n     \n\n(\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5mol.g-1) \n[B]\n\nb\n    \n\n(\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5mol.g-1) \n[L]+[B] \n\nc\n \n\n(\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5mol.g-1) \n[L]/[B] [L]350/[L]150 [B]350/[B]150 Total \n\nacidity \nd\n \n\n(\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5mol.g-1) \n\nRef \n\nAl-TUD-1(21) 138 59 197\n \n 2.3 0.6 0.02 - this \n\nwork \n\nAl-TUD-1(25) 24 4 28   6 - - 370 \n16\n\n \n\nAl-TUD-1(25) \n \n\n- - - 2.4 \nc\n - - 400  \n\n15\n \n\nAl-TUD-1(50) 17 2 19  2.2 - - 220  \n16\n\n \n\nAl-TUD-1(50) 133 59 192  2.2 - - - \n51\n\n \n\nAl-TUD-1(75) 8 2 10 4.3 - - 210  \n16\n\n \n\nAl-TUD-1(100) 8 1 9 5.4 - - 130  \n16\n\n \na) Concentration of Lewis acid sites (L) based on pyridine FT-IR spectroscopic data. b) Concentration of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites (B) based on \npyridine FT-IR spectroscopic data. c) Total amount of acid sites based on pyridine FT-IR spectroscopic data. d) Determined by TPD-NH3 \nat 200 \u00b0C.   \n\n \n\n  \n\nAlthough the L are probably due to defective framework and/or extra-framework \n\naluminium species, the possibility that L may also arise from tetrahedral aluminium cannot be \n\nexcluded. Indeed, in a study of the adsorption of pyridine on mesoporous aluminosilicate SBA-15 \n\nmolecular sieves, Luan and Fournier reported that the tetrahedral aluminium centres contributed \n\nonly to L acidity.61 Normally, in crystalline zeolite materials, tetrahedral aluminium is expected to \n\nform bridging hydroxyl groups (Si-OH-Al), contributing to B acidity. However, Luan and Fourier \n\nreasoned that tetrahedral aluminium in mesoporous aluminosilicates with amorphous pore walls \n\ncould contribute to L acidity due to crystallographic disorder at the atomic level.16,61  This can \n\nexplain why the concentration of B was lower than that of L, similar to that described in the \n\nliterature for Al-TUD-1 with different Si/Al ratios.15,51 Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the \n\nnumber of B in Al-TUD-1 may be underestimated since pyridine is a weak base (compared with, \n\nfor example, ammonia) and may not be able to deprotonate the weaker AS present in the sample. \n\nHowever ammonia was not chosen because it may lead to an overestimate of the effective \n\nnumber of AS because of its smaller molecular dimensions in comparison to the saccharide \n\nmolecules.62 \n\nFor Al-TUD-1, at 350 \u00b0C pyridine desorbed more easily from the B than from the L.  Thus, \n\nthe molar ratio of moderate and strong to total B ([B]350/[B]150) was 0.02, indicating that most of \n\nthe AS were of a rather weak nature, which means that for Al-TUD-1 at 350 \u00b0C, the B desorbed \n\nnearly all the pyridine. The L ratio ([L]350/[L]150) was 0.6.  \n\n \n\n\n\nAl-TUD-1 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n203 \n\n \n\n4.2.2.

In \n\nthe case of Glu, Hmf may be formed from Fru (the isomerisation product), and this pathway may \n\nbe in competition with major Glu degradation pathways.72-74 Somewhat in parallel with those \n\nobserved for Al-TUD-1, the published results for microporous zeolites used as solid acid catalysts \n\nin the conversion of hexoses to Hmf seem better for Fru than for Glu as substrate (Table 4.3). \n\nGenerally, better results are then reported for the production of Hmf by the dehydration of Fru in \n\ncomparison to that of Glu.75,76 The reaction of Glu in the presence of the zeolite H-Y (Si/Al=6.5) \n\ngave less than 10% YHmf at ca. 75% CGlu, 160 \u00b0C.\n76 In contrast, the reaction of Fru in the presence of \n\nH-Beta, H-ZSM-5, H-Mordenite and H-Y Faujauste zeolites with Si/Al ratios in the range of 10-100 \n\nwas quite selective towards Hmf, with one of the best results being 91% SHmf at 76% CFru for H-\n\nMordenite(11)3,76(Table 4.3). Moreau et al.3,76 reported that the Si/Al ratio for the zeolite catalysts \n\ninfluenced the rate of the reaction of Fru to Hmf, most likely due to changes in the acid properties \n\nand/or the surface polarity of the catalyst.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.3- Performance of Al-TUD-1 in the reaction of D-fructose (Fru) or D-glucose (Glu) using the \n\nbiphasic solvent system (Wt:Tol) a and comparison with literature data for zeolites as catalysts. \n\nCatalyst Temperature (\u00b0C)  Time (h) CFru/CGlu (%) \nd\n YHmf (%) \n\ne\n Ref \n\nAl-TUD-1(21) 170 6 100/75 20/17 this work \n\nH-Mordenite(11) \nb\n 165 1 76/- 69/- \n\n76,77\n \n\nH-Mordenite(100) \nb\n 165 1 48/1 39/- \n\n77\n \n\nH-Beta(15) \nb\n 165 1 85/- 34/- \n\n77\n \n\nH-Y Faujasite(10) \nb\n 165 1 74/- 41/- \n\n77\n \n\nH-ZSM-5(25) \nb\n 165 1 90/- 53/- \n\n77\n \n\nH-Y Faujasite(6.5) 160 3 -/68 -/7 \n2\n \n\nH-Y Faujasite \nc\n 150 24 -/78 -/11 \n\n78\n \n\na) Reaction conditions: 0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v) biphasic solvent system, 170 \u00b0C, 20 gcat.dm\n-3\n\n, 0.67 M Fru/Glu. b) Wt:IBMK= 1:5 (v/v). c) nf= \ninformation not found. d) Conversion of D-fructose( CFru)/conversion of D-glucose (CGlu). e) 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde yield (YHmf). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe one-pot conversion of the disaccharides D-sucrose (Glu and Fru linked by an ether \n\nbond between C-1 on the Glu unit and C-2 on the Fru unit, denoted by a ?-(1-2) glycosidic bond) \n\nand D-cellobiose (two Glu units linked by a ?-(1-4) glycosidic bond) in the presence of Al-TUD-1 \n\ngave 100% of conversion at 1 h of reaction and 98% of conversion at 6 h of reaction, respectively, \n\nindicating that D-sucrose (Suc) is more reactive than D-cellobiose (Cel) (Figures 4.13 and 4.14).

After 30 min of reaction, the monosaccharide yields decreased, especially for Fru. \n\nThis is consistent with the Fru reactivity being higher than that for Glu, as referred above and a \n\nmaximum 17% YHmf was reached.  In the case of Cel, Glu is the main product (50% YGlu) at 6 h of \n\nreaction. The YFru and YHmf were 10% and 12%, respectively (Figure 4.14). For both disaccharides \n\nminor amounts of Man and Fur were formed during the 6 h of reaction (as observed with Fru and \n\nGlu as feedstocks). The undesirable reaction pathways may be similar to those occurring for Fru \n\nand Glu, as Suc and Cel are hydrolysed into these monosaccharides, giving similar results in terms \n\nof Hmf yield to those obtained with the monosaccharides (a maximum 20% and 17% YHmf, \n\nrespectively, Table 4.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n210 \n \n\nTable 4.4- Catalytic performance of Al-TUD-1 in the conversion of D-sucrose (Suc) or D-cellobiose \n\n(Cel) to D-fructose (Fru), D-glucose (Glu) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf), and \n\ncomparison with the literature data for zeolite H-Y. a \n\nCatalyst \n \n\nSubstrate t(h) \nc\n T (\u00b0C) \n\nd\n C (%) \n\ne\n YFru+Glu (%) \n\nf\n YHmf (%) \n\ng\n Ref \n\nAl-TUD-1 D-Sucrose 0.5 170 85 39+41 4 this work \n\nAl-TUD-1 D-Sucrose 1 170 100 26+29 12 this work \n\nAl-TUD-1 D-Sucrose 6 170 100 11+20 17 this work \n\nH-Y (Si/Al=15) \nb\n D-Sucrose 0.67 85 100 100  Traces \n\n80\n \n\nAl-TUD-1 D-Cellobiose 0.5 170 26 0 0 this work \n\nAl-TUD-1 D-Cellobiose 6 170 60 10+50 12 this work \n\nH-Y (Si/Al=15) \nb \n\nD-Cellobiose nf \ne\n 150 90 88  nf \n\ne\n \n\n80\n \n\na) Reaction conditions: 0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v) biphasic solvent system, 170 \u00b0C, 20 gcat.dm\n-3\n\n, 0.67 M Xyl. b) Using only water as solvent.       \nc) Reaction time. d) Reaction temperature. e) Conversion at a given time. f) Total yield of D-fructose and D-glucose (YFru+Glu). g) Yield of \n5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (YHmf). e) nf= information not found. \n\n \n\n  \n \nFigure 4.15- Hydrolysis and dehydration of inulin in the presence of Al-TUD-1: (?) yield of              \n\nD-fructose (YFru), (?) yield of D-glucose (YGlu), (-) yield of D-mannose (YMan), and (? ) yield of 5-\n\nhydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (YHmf).

A fast \n\ndrop in the YFru with time was accompanied by the formation of Hmf, reaching 20 wt.% yield at 6 h \n\nof reaction (the theoretical yield is ca. 78 wt.%). Glu and Man (formed by reversible isomerisation) \n\n\n\nAl-TUD-1 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n211 \n\n \n\nwere also identified as minor products (&lt;5 wt.% yield). In face of these results it seemed that \n\ninulin could be rather selectively hydrolysed into Fru using Al-TUD-1 as catalyst, as the YHmf at 30 \n\nmin was only 9 wt.%. The selective hydrolysis of inulin (avoiding Hmf formation) was successfully \n\ncarried out using H-Y zeolite (Si/Al=15) at lower reaction temperatures (ca. 92% YFru, at 90 \u00b0C).\n80 \n\nThe YFur at 91% CXyl was 60%, indicating a substantial amount of by-products (31% yield). \n\nDuring the reaction of Xyl the initially colourless Wt:Tol phases turned yellow-orange and the \n\nwhite powdered catalyst turned brown, suggesting the presence of organic by-products. \n\nHowever, these organic by-products were not detected in significant amounts by HPLC of the \n\naqueous phase and GC-MS of the Tol phase. Possibly, these by-products are essentially \n\noligo/polymeric products, formed via fragmentation and/or condensation reactions as explained \n\nin Chapter 1.65,82 \n\nSimilar to that observed for the Xyl dehydration, the presence of by-products in the case \n\nof the hexoses dehydration was evident by the colour build-up in the liquid phases and in the \n\ncatalyst, although no significant amounts of by-products were detected. Fur was always detected \n\nin minor amounts (&lt;2% yield within 6 h in the reaction of each hexose), and may be formed via \n\nconsecutive tautomerisation and retro aldol reactions from Glu.72-74 It was proposed that Glu in \n\nthe cyclic form suffers consecutive tautomerisations (tau) to give 3-ketose (1,2,4,5,6-\n\npentahydroxy 3-hexanone), which then suffers a retro aldol (RA) reaction giving arabinose, \n\nfollowed by dehydration to give Fur (Figure 4.16).83 Another possible by-product resulting from \n\nthe Hmf hydrolysis is levulinic acid.  However, it was not detected by HPLC, possibly because the \n\nAS of Al-TUD-1 were not strong enough. Usually more acidic conditions are required for \n\nconverting Hmf into levulinic acid than for Hmf formation.84 According to the literature, Hmf may \n\nbe involved in the formation of coke deposits on the microporous surface of aluminosilicates.76 \n\nTaking into consideration that polymerisation reactions may be enhanced under relatively weak \n\nacidic conditions,84 and that Al-TUD-1 possessed mainly Lewis and weak Br\u00f6nsted acidity, it is \n\npossible that by-products were essentially polymers. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n212 \n \n\ntau\n\nHO\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nHO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\ntau\n\n1,2-enediol\n\ntau\n\nHO\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nFru\n\nHO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\ntau\n\n2,4-enediol\n\nHO\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\n3- Ketose\n\ntau\nH\n\nH H\n\nO\n\nHO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\nRA\n\nHO\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\nOH\n\ntau\n\nArabinose\n\nO\n\nO\n\n-3H2O\n\nO\n\nOH\n\nHO\nHO\n\nOH\n\nGlu\n\nOH\n\nFur\n\nH\n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.16- Reaction mechanism proposed by Aida et al.74 for the conversion of D-glucose (Glu) \n\nto 2-furaldehyde (Fur); tau= tautomerisation, RA= retro aldol [adapted from 74,85]. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.5. Catalyst stability \n\n \n\n \n\nTo test the stability and possible reusability of Al-TUD-1, the catalytic performance of the \n\ncatalyst was studied for four consecutive 6 h batch runs of the Xyl reaction. The catalyst \n\nregeneration procedure is described in the experimental part (Chapter 2). The conversions of        \n\nD-xylose and Fur yields in the recycling runs were quite similar (87-96% and 56-60%, respectively) \n\n(Figure 4.17). The Si/Al mole ratio of the recovered solid was 22, which is comparable to that of \n\nthe fresh catalyst (Si/Al=21, Table 4.1). These results suggested that Al-TUD-1 was fairly stable \n\nunder the reaction conditions used. \n\n \n\n\n\nAl-TUD-1 \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n213 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.17- Catalytic performance of Al-TUD-1 in four consecutive 6 h batch runs at 170 \u00b0C. \n\nReaction conditions: 0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v) biphasic solvent system, 20 gcat.dm\n-3, 0.67 M Xyl. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3. Conclusions \n\n \n\n \n\nThe reaction of monosaccharides in the presence of Al-TUD-1, under the reaction \n\nconditions used, gave Fur (from Xyl) and Hmf (from Glu and Fru). However, the reaction of \n\nhexoses (Fru and Glu) did not seem to be selective to Hmf (17-20% YHmf at 6 h of reaction) in \n\ncomparison to the reaction of Xyl, which gave 60% YFur at 6 h. A possible explanation might be \n\nassociated to the acid properties of Al-TUD-1 (mainly L acidity and weak B acidity) being more \n\nfavourable to convert Xyl into Fur than hexoses into Hmf. The one-pot hydrolysis/dehydration of \n\nthe disaccharides (Suc and Cel) in the presence of Al-TUD-1 gave mainly the monosaccharides via \n\nhydrolysis, which are subsequently dehydrated into Hmf obtained in 17% and 12% YHmf from Suc \n\nand Cel, respectively. At the maximum YHmf, the monosaccharide yields were 31 and 59%, \n\nrespectively. In the case of polysaccharides D-xylan and inulin, Fur and Hmf were formed in 18 \n\nand 20 wt.% yield within 6 h of reaction, respectively.  \n\nBased on the colour build-up of the solvents (colourless water/toluene phases turned \n\nyellow-orange) and of the catalyst (white-brown-black) during the course of the reactions, and \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n214 \n \n\nthe fact that no significant amounts of by-products were detected, it is postulated that the \n\nformation of polymers and coke deposits may be important competitive reactions, affecting the \n\nyields of Fur and Hmf. The stability of Al-TUD-1 with Xyl as the substrate was confirmed by the \n\napproximately constant values of Xyl conversions and Fur yields (in the range of 56-60%) for at \n\nleast four consecutive 6 h batch runs.  \n\nThe catalytic performance of Al-TUD-1 may be improved by fine-tuning the acid \n\nproperties (varying the Si/Al ratio)16 and optimising the reaction conditions. Alternatively, the \n\nmesoporous inorganic oxide matrix could be used to embed and disperse zeolite nanocrystals, \n\nwhich may allow enhanced acid strength (associated with the zeolite component) whilst \n\nimproving the accessibility of the substrate to the AS in comparison to the bulk zeolite. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.

Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nAs mentioned previously, heterogeneous porous solid catalysts present several \n\nadvantages over homogeneous catalysts mainly due to the easier catalyst separation after the \n\nreaction, leading to a reduction in the costs of separation techniques, which are quite demanding \n\nfor homogeneous systems.2 However there are critical requirements to be considered such as \n\nthermal stability and water-tolerance. SAPOs and Al-TUD-1 demonstrated to be water-tolerant \n\nporous solid acid catalysts used in the conversion of saccharides to furanic aldehydes. Successfully \n\ninvestigated materials include crystalline inorganic oxides, namely the zeolites H-Y Faujasite,       \n\nH-Mordenite,3 H-ZSM-5,4 microporous niobium silicates,5,6 titanoniobate nanosheets,7 and a \n\ndelaminated zeolite obtained by the swelling and ultrasonication of a layerered precursor of     \n\nNu-6(2)8. It is possible to fine-tune the acid properties of microporous or mesoporous materials, \n\nto improve the catalytic performance in Fur production for making them excellent catalysts for \n\none-pot multi-step processes.9  The number of acid sites (AS) can be maximised per unit weight of \n\ncatalyst and the acid strength of those sites can be modified by changing the composition, such as \n\nthe Si/Al ratio. It is also desirable to increase their accessibility to the reactant molecules by \n\nproducing a material with the appropriate surface area and porosity. In the case of multistep \n\nreactions the solid catalysts should preferably possess large surface areas and optimum \n\nadsorption characteristics.9 To achieve these characteristics the initial concentration of reactants \n\nin the synthesis mixture, the pH and aging time of the synthesis gel are important parameters.9,10  \n\nAluminosilicate catalysts are known to be more attractive in terms of production costs \n\nand/or availability in comparison to transition-metal containing ones. They can be amorphous or \n\ncrystalline in which the presence of tetrahedrally coordinated aluminium generates a negatively \n\ncharged framework, which in turn is compensated by cations, such as hydronium cations (Figure \n\n5.1).9 Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with well-defined structures that contain aluminium, \n\nsilicon and oxygen in their regular framework. They are built up of a 3 D array of tetrahedral units \n\nTO4 (T=Si, Al) with each apical oxygen atom bridging two adjacent tetrahedra. Zeolites are one of \n\nthe most important families of crystalline microporous solids. Since zeolite frameworks are \n\ntypically anionic (network of SiO4 tetrahedra is neutral while AlO4 bears a negative charge), charge \n\ncompensating cations (Na+, K+ or NH4\n+) populate the pores to maintain electrical neutrality.11 The \n\ngeneral formula of a zeolite is Mx/m[(AlO2)x(SiO2)y]zH2O, where M is the cation with valence m, z is \n\nthe number of water molecules in each unit cell, and x and y  are integers.12 \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n222 \n \n\nO\nSi Al\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nH\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\n? +\n\n? -\n\n \n\nFigure 5.1- Structure of an amorphous and crystalline aluminosilicate [adapted from 9]. \n\n \n\n \n\nZeolites belong to a class named tectosilicates although they have the particularity of \n\nhaving open channels and cavities of molecular dimensions which does not happen with other \n\nmembers of the tectosilicate family (e.g. SiO2 groups, Feldspathoid group). The dimensions of the \n\ncavities and channels (ca. 0.3 to 1.5 nm) in their structures give these materials unique properties \n\nsuch as, the ability to adsorb molecules of various sizes and shapes.13 Zeolites can be classified \n\ninto small pore zeolites with 8 membered rings (MR) pore apertures (3.0-4.5 \u00c5), medium pore \n\nzeolites with 10-MR pore apertures (4.5-6.0 \u00c5) and large pore zeolites with 12-MR apertures   \n\n(6.0-8.0  \u00c5) of which zeolite Beta is an example, represented in Figure 5.2.11 \n\n \n\n                                                                                                          \n\n                         A                                                         B                                                    C \n\nFigure 5.2- Structure of zeolite BEA viewed along [100] (A and B) and along [001] (C).1 \n\n \n\n \n\nDespite all the advantages, an important drawback is the formation of coke, which may \n\nlead to drops in Fur selectivity. Reducing the crystallite size of the catalyst to the nanoscale would \n\nincrease the surface area to micropore volume ratio and decrease the diffusion path lengths, \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1. \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n223 \n\n \n\nwhich may avoid severe coking. On the other hand, the reduction in crystallite size may enhance \n\nthe L/B ratio, which may be beneficial since Lewis acids may stabilise intermediate species and \n\nenhance selectivity towards Fur.14 However, nanosized materials tend to pose concerns related to \n\nhealth, the environment, and technical issues (e.g. ease of handling, high pressure drops, up-flow \n\nclogging of equipment, and demanding separation techniques such as nanofiltration). Composite \n\nmaterials consisting of zeolite nanocrystals embedded in a mesoporous inorganic oxide matrix \n\nmay benefit from the catalytic properties associated with the zeolite nanocrystals, while \n\nminimising the nanoscale-related drawbacks.15-24 \n\nTaking into account these considerations, the dehydration of Xyl into Fur in the presence \n\nof zeolite H-Beta and a micro/mesoporous BEATUD-1 composite material as catalysts was \n\ninvestigated and the results are compared with those for bulk nanocrystalline zeolite H-Beta \n\n(denoted BEA). \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1.1. Zeolite Beta (BEA) \n\n \n\n \n\nZeolite BEA is included in the group of high silica zeolites (with a Si/Al ? 10). This group of \n\nzeolites was described between the late 1960s and early 1970s and is synthesised at the Mobil \n\nResearch and Development Laboratories of the \u201chigh silica zeolites\u201d.25-27 Beta has a specific \n\nstrength and density of AS that allow achieving superior levels of conversion at lower reaction \n\ntemperatures than catalysts based only on silica,28 and it was the first zeolite to be discovered by \n\nR.

Rosinski in 1967.26,27 However its complex structure was only \n\ncompletely determined in 1988.28-30 The most interesting property is its highly disordered \n\nframework.31 It consists of an intergrowth of three distinct polymorphs32: polymorph A, B and C, \n\nbuilt from different stacking of the same building layer.32 The structure of polymorph C was \n\ndetermined by several different techniques (SEM, powder XRD and TGA).33 The structures of \n\npolymorphs A and B were proposed on the basis of high resolution electron microscopy (HREM) \n\nimages and electron diffraction (ED) patterns.34 At first, zeolite Beta was accepted as a highly \n\nfaulted intergrowth of only two polymorphs A and B in a 60:40 ratio that grew as 2 D sheets \n\nrandomly alternated between each other.33 Both polymorphs have a 3 D network of 12-MR pore \n\nsystems in which the intergrowth does not significantly affect the pores in two of the dimensions, \n\nwhere two mutually perpendicular straight channels with elliptical pore apertures of (6.4x7.6 \u00c5) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n224 \n \n\nrun in the x and y directions (Figures 5.2 A and B).35 However in the crystallographic faulting \n\ndirection, the pore system might become tortuous, where a sinusoidal channel of 5.5x5.5 \u00c5 runs \n\nparallel to the z direction (Figure 5.2 C).36  The third polymorph C has a 3 D pore system formed by \n\nlinear channels of nearly circular 12-MR (ca. 6.9 \u00c5).32 In the case of the other two polymorphs (A \n\nand B) one of the channels is sinusoidal.33 Polymorph C also differs from A and B polymorphs \n\nbecause it contains double 4-MR (D4-MR) per unit cell as secondary building units that do not \n\nappear in polymorphs A or B.33 The different polymorphs consist of layers formed by 5- and 6-MR \n\nthat may be stacked in different sequences forming 12-MR pores (Figure 5.3).31,32,37,38  \n\n \n\n \n\n                     A                                                          B                                                        C  \n\nFigure 5.3- Framework structures of A) polymorph A, B) polymorph B and C) polymorph C of \n\nzeolite Beta, showing the different stackings of the 12-MR pores as A) ABAB (shears with \n\nalternating translations), B) ABCABC (shears in the same direction) and C) AA.32 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe surface of the zeolite BEA studied herein with a Si/Al=12 allows organophobic-\n\nhydrophilic selectivity, in contrast to zeolites with higher Si/Al ratios.39 It favours the adsorption of \n\npolar molecules (such as the substrate studied, Xyl) and interacts weakly with organic molecules, \n\nlike the product Fur. Therefore zeolite Beta is adequate for converting Xyl to Fur. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1.2. Microporous/mesoporous BEATUD-1 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe micro/mesoporous composite material consisting of BEA zeolite nanocrystals \n\nembedded in a TUD-1 type mesoporous inorganic oxide matrix was denoted as BEATUD-1. The \n\nfeatures of TUD-140 have been described in detail in Chapter 4. The composites can be prepared \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1. \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n225 \n\n \n\nby blending pre-formed zeolite nanocrystals into the synthesis mixture of a mesoporous carrier. \n\nAdditional advantages of these composites may include the ability to maintain stable the catalyst \n\ncomponent on the carrier, improving its lifetime, and its use for catalyst formulations allowing \n\nenhanced porosity of extrudates and fairly good control over composition, size and morphology of \n\nthe catalyst component. The choice of a 3 D mesoporous silica matrix of the type TUD-1 is \n\nattractive since its preparation is based on a relatively low cost, non-surfactant templating route, \n\nand may be advantageous in relation to a 2 D material in terms of facilitated internal diffusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Catalysts characterisation \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this Chapter zeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 were prepared in accordance with \n\nthe procedure described by Maschmeyer et al. (Chapter 2).15,16 Zeolite Beta in the proton form \n\n(BEA) was obtained by calcination of the commercial ammonium-form of the Beta powder. The \n\ncomposite BEATUD-1 was prepared by embedding H-Beta nanocrystallites (40 wt.%) in the 3 D \n\nmesoporous silica TUD-1.15,16 \n\nThe powder XRD patterns are shown in Figure 5.4. From this Figure it is possible to see \n\nthat the XRD patterns of the bulk nanocrystalline zeolie BEA and the composite BEATUD-1 were \n\nsimilar, showing the characteristic diffraction peaks of zeolite BEA at 2?=7.2\u00b0 and 22.3\u00b0.15,24,35,41-157 \n\nThe low angle peak was broadened due to the presence of an intergrowth of different \n\npolymorphs (mainly A and B) in the crystals. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n226 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4- Powder XRD patterns of the fresh and recovered catalysts. \n\n \n\n \n\nTEM images of the zeolite BEA and the composite BEATUD-1 were collected in order to \n\ndetermine the size and morphology of the crystals or aggregates (Figure 5.5).158 These images of \n\nzeolite Beta showed that the sample consisted of small crystallites with a size of about 20-30 nm, \n\nwhich were clustered to give larger particles with dimensions in the range of 100-200 nm        \n\n(Figure 5.5a). Comparable results for crystallite sizes from 15 to 60 nm, which further aggregated, \n\nare described in the literature.24,48,56,69,71,93,157,159 \n\nThe high resolution (HR) TEM image shown in Figure 5.5 b clearly showed that the \n\naggregates of Beta crystals had lattice fringes uniformly aligned with the aggregates. Lattice \n\nfringes are characteristic of the zeolite Beta, and are in agreement with that described by Kuechl \n\net al.,62 and others.42,91,143,158,160,161 Some authors had obtained irregular spherical H-Beta \n\nparticles,24,55,159,162,163 or cubic-shape particles.164 According to Kuechl et al.62 the parallel nature of \n\nthe lattice fringes for adjacent crystals might have two different interpretations. One of them says \n\nthat the individual crystals are nucleated in solution and then attached later in an oriented \n\nfashion which lowers the overall free energy of the synthesis medium (the crystals attach to one \n\nanother in an energetically favourable manner). The multiple nucleation sites on a gel particle is \n\nthe other hypothesis that may explain the adjacent crystals formed in parallel fringes.62 The highly \n\nfaulted structure of zeolite Beta observed in the TEM images (Figure 5.5 b) is in good agreement \n\nwith the XRD data (the boarder peak at 2?=7.2\u00b0), suggesting the presence of two polymorphs \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1. \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n227 \n\n \n\ntypical for zeolite BEA.41 For BEATUD-1, TEM characterisation showed a 3 D sponge- or wormlike \n\nmesoporous matrix with some dark gray domains that may be attributed to the embedded zeolite \n\nparticles (Figure 5.5 c) in accord with the literature for a BEATUD-1 composite with a zeolite \n\nloading of 16-20 wt.%.15,157 HRTEM images (Figure 5.5 d) confirmed that BEATUD-1 is a composite \n\nof nanocrystalline BEA particles and an amorphous mesoporous matrix (TUD-1), whereby the \n\nmicroporosity is resulting from the crystalline zeolite particles and the mesoporous phase from \n\nthe amorphous component. The TEM studies generally revealed aggregates (about 50-200 nm) of \n\nnanocrystals surrounded by the mesoporous matrix. Areas containing isolated BEA nanocrystals \n\n(about 20-30 nm) embedded in the matrix were also observed. The presence of small aggregates \n\nis in agreement with previous findings for a BEATUD-1 composite with a zeolite loading of            \n\n40 wt.%,15 and can be attributed to the combined effect of the synthesis conditions and the high \n\nzeolite loading. Despite the presence of these aggregates, the TEM studies (Figure 5.5 d) indicated \n\nthat the nanocrystalline BEA particles were fairly evenly distributed in the mesoporous matrix, \n\nsimilar to that reported by Waller et al.15 for these types of materials.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5- TEM images of BEA (a and b) and BEATUD-1 (c and d). The amorphous carbon support \n\nfilm used for BEA (b) appears as the mottled background in the upper and lower right-hand parts \n\nof the micrograph; a holey carbon film was used for BEATUD-1 to clearly distinguish the \n\nmesoporous silica matrix of the composite from the background of the support. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n228 \n \n\nElemental composition and textural properties of the zeolite BEA, BEATUD-1 and TUD-1 \n\nare given in Table 5.1. To assess the textural properties of these materials (BEA, BEATUD-1 and \n\nTUD-1), nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed at -196 \u00b0C (Figure 5.6). The \n\nadsorption isotherm of BEA clearly showed a significant increase in N2 uptake at p/p0 &lt;0.01, \n\ntypically associated with the filling of micropores (characteristic of type I adsorption isotherms). \n\n165-169 Afterwards a gradual increase in N2 uptake was observed as p/p0 approached unity, most \n\nlikely due to multilayer adsorption on the external surface of the nanocrystallites, accounting for a \n\nsignificant external surface area (SEXT=176 m\n2.g-1,Table 5.1). The pore size distribution (PSD) of BEA \n\nshows a very broad and weak maximum centred on a pore width of ca. 7 nm, which probably \n\narises from the inter-nanocrystallite empty void spaces. BEATUD-1 and purely siliceous TUD-1 \n\nexhibited type IV isotherms, typical of mesoporous materials and a hysteresis loop at     p/p0 > 0.4 \n\nwhich is associated with capillary condensation/evaporation in mesopores.165,166,168-175 The PSDs \n\nshowed maxima at pore widths of ca. 4.5 nm for BEATUD-1 and 7.0 nm for TUD-1. In contrast to \n\nTUD-1, BEATUD-1 possesses microporosity arising from the zeolite component, although the \n\ncomposite is essentially mesoporous. This is consistent with the literature data for zeolite \n\nnanocrystals BEA,15,52,111,128,140,176,177and the composite BEATUD-1 (Table 5.1).15 \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n229 \n\n \n\nTable 5.1- Elemental composition and textural properties of BEA, BEATUD-1 and TUD-1 and comparison with literature data. \n\nSample Al \n\n(mmol.g\n-1\n\n) \n\nSi/Al  \n\n(before/after catalysis) \n\nVmicro \n\n(cm\n3\n.g\n\n-1\n) \n\nVp \n\n(cm\n3\n.g\n\n-1\n) \n\nSurface area \n\n(m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n) \n\nSEXT \n\n(m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n) \n\nDp(meso) \n(nm) \n\nAverage size \n\n(\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5m)  \nRef \n\nBEA 0.96 12/13 \nc\n 0.18 \n\ne\n 0.69 643 \n\nm\n 176 -

This result suggested that the zeolite was completely incorporated \n\nin the final material. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n232 \n \n\n27Al MAS NMR is important because it is an effective tool for characterising the structure \n\nof zeolites. It allows differentiating aluminium-containing species with different structures or \n\ndifferent chemical environments because they have different chemicals shifts in the 27Al MAS \n\nNMR spectra.112,196 It has been widely used to determine the coordination number,87,197,198 and \n\nlocal structure of specific aluminium species in zeolites.87According to crystallographic data, \n\nzeolite Beta contains three or nine different T-sites, depending on the type of polymorphs \n\npresent.28,29,199-201 Nevertheless, these T-sites in the Beta framework can be resolved into only two \n\nor three due to small differences in the chemical shifts of the T-sites.197 The regular coordination \n\nof aluminium in the zeolite framework is tetrahedral.197 Figure 5.7 shows the 27Al MAS NMR \n\nspectra of BEA and BEATUD-1. Both of them exhibited two groups of peaks at about 55 ppm and a \n\nlarger peak at 0 ppm, which were attributed to aluminium species in tetrahedral framework (Altet) \n\nand octahedral coordination (Aloct), respectively, in agreement with the literature data for zeolite \n\nBeta.84,95,112,113,125,150,154,182,196,200,202-205 Normally the peak at 0 ppm is ascribed to extra-framework \n\noctahedral aluminium species which are formed during calcination.206,207 However, in the case of \n\nthe acid zeolite Beta octahedral framework aluminium might also be present.197 Specific \n\nframework tetrahedral T-sites tend to convert to framework-associated octahedral sites during \n\nthe calcination.200 Bourgeat-Lami et al.208 were the first to suggest the existence of octahedral \n\nframework aluminium species at 0 ppm in zeolite Beta. This type of framework octahedral \n\naluminium can only be formed in the presence of water. 202,206,209 According to Bokhoven et al.197 \n\nthe Br\u00f6nsted acid zeolite attracts water molecules to stabilise the strong electric field induced by \n\nthe proton, delocalising the cationic charge. Since the zeolite is not able to accommodate many \n\nstrong electrical field centers throughout the framework, the water molecules are attracted and \n\npart of the framework tetrahedral aluminium may be converted to octahedral aluminium, \n\nreducing the electrical field in the framework.197 It was proposed by the authors that this \n\naluminium might be connected to the framework via one or two oxygen atoms. 197 Alternatively, \n\nan aluminium atom may be connected via four oxygen atoms to the framework and coordinated \n\nby one water molecule and one hydronium ion.155,202,208,210,211 The aluminium in octahedral \n\ncoordination might result from the hydrolysis of the Al-O bond.206 Abraham et al.200  verified that \n\nin zeolite H-Beta, octahedrally coordinated framework-associated aluminium atoms could be \n\nquantitatively reverted into tetrahedral coordination, and that the amount of these octahedral \n\naluminium species decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, and are absent in samples with very high-\n\nSi/Al ratios.200 This theory was confirmed by Woolery et al.212 that reported that the peak in the \n\nregion of 0 ppm corresponding to octahedral aluminium can be converted to the tetrahedral \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n233 \n\n \n\ncoordination by alkali ion-exchange or by treatment with NH3; and by Bockhoven et al.\n213,214 \n\nreporting that all the octahedral aluminium of an acid zeolite was converted to tetrahedral \n\naluminium by heating above 100 \u00b0C.  \n\nThe 27Al MAS NMR spectrum obtained for BEA was very similar to that reported by Beers \n\net al.215 for a commercial zeolite Beta in the H+-form with a bulk Si/Al ratio of 13 (ref CP 814 E-22), \n\nand Li et al.112 for Beta (Si/Al=15). Besides the sharp peak at 0 ppm that can be assigned to a \n\nframework connected octahedral aluminium (reported for acidic zeolite Beta ), there is a broad \n\ncentred around  - 18 ppm that could be due to extra-framework (octahedral) aluminium oxide \n\namorphous species left over from the synthesis (Figure 5.7).215 Furthermore a few authors had \n\nobtained a third signal at ca. 25 ppm, which was attributed to pentacoordinated aluminium or to \n\nan aluminium atom in highly distorted tetrahedral coordination.145,216-218 However this was not \n\nverified in the present work (Figure 5.7). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7- 27Al MAS NMR spectra of BEA (green) and BEATUD-1 (blue). \n\n \n\n \n\n  Engelhardt et al.219 considered that the peak at 0 ppm was due to extra-framework \n\noctahedral aluminium and proposed that relative proportions of tetrahedral framework and \n\noctahedral aluminium could be directly determined from the peak intensities (I) of the tetrahedral \n\naluminium, Altet, and the octahedral aluminium, Aloct, signals.\n219 According to the authors, the Si/Al \n\nratio of the tetrahedral framework species (Si/Al)fr could be calculated using the equation 5.1 \n\n((Si/Al)tot is the total ratio of Si/Al ): \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n234 \n \n\n                                                  ???????? =  ?\n??\n?????? \u00d7\n\n?????????????? ?\n??????\n\n                                                     (5.1) \n\n \n\nA(Si/Al)fr of 15.8 was obtained which was higher than the value of 12 obtained from ICP-\n\nAES (Table 5.1). The difference between the NMR and ICP-AES results represents the contribution \n\nfrom octahedral aluminium in the sample (that can be framework and extra-framework as \n\ndiscussed above) assuming that all the aluminium were detected by 27Al MAS NMR spectrum.125 \n\nAccording to the literature, octahedral species in zeolite BEA might be associated with Lewis acid \n\nsites (L).197,212,220,221  \n\n \n\nThe acidity of aluminosilicates investigated by FT-IR may be associated with bridging \n\nhydroxyl groups (Si-OH-Al) formed by tetrahedral aluminium,222 (ca. 3600 cm-1 on the FT-IR \n\nspectra),223,224 hydroxyl groups, such as internal or terminal silanol Si-OH groups                     \n\n(3740 cm-1),223,224 and Al-OH groups (3780 and 3680 cm-1)208,224 on the surface of the \n\naluminosilicate which are usually weakly acidic.155,238 The measurement of the acid properties of \n\nthe prepared catalysts (BEA and BEATUD-1) was performed by FT-IR studies of adsorbed \n\npyridine after outgassing at 150 \u00b0C. In the case of zeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 the \n\npresence of Si-OH terminal groups was evident by the presence of an intense band at ca. 3745 \n\ncm-1 (Figure 5.8), similar to reported in the literature.205,222,225-228 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.8- FT-IR spectra of BEA and BEATUD-1 after pyridine adsorption and outgassing at      \n\n150 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n235 \n\n \n\nBEA and BEATUD-1 possessed both B and L interacting with pyridine after outgassing at    \n\n150 \u00b0C.

In this sense, the [B] (band at ca. 1545 cm-1) and [L] (band at ca. 1450 cm-1) \n\nfor the zeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 were determined through equations 3.1 and 3.2, as \n\nspecified in Chapter 3 (Table 5.2). Figure 5.9 shows the FT-IR spectra of the catalysts with \n\nadsorbed pyridine, after outgassing at 150 \u00b0C.

A similar behaviour was verified for zeolite Beta with a Si/Al of ca. 13-31,70,178,225-\n\n227,229,234 but the opposite was also obtained for zeolite Beta samples with a similar Si/Al ratio \n\n(11-13),163,222,227,233-235 or higher Si/Al ratio of 42-60.92,232 In BEA the positively charged extra-\n\nframework aluminium species may neutralise the negative charge of AlO4 tetrahedra and \n\ndecrease the [B].155 In terms of the L/B molar ratio and acid strengths, the acid properties of BEA \n\nand BEATUD-1 were somewhat comparable.  \n\nThe effect of the outgassing temperature on the [L] and [B] was also investigated, and it \n\nwas observed a decrease in the amount of detected AS with an increase in the outgassing \n\ntemperature (Figure 5.10). The ratios of the amounts of AS were measured at 150 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C. \n\nAt 350 \u00b0C, pyridine desorbed more easily from the B than from the L.

In the case of L ratio \n\n([L]350/[L]150) this value was 0.8, which means that these were stronger due to the fact that they \n\nalmost did not desorb the pyridine at a temperature of 350 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.10- Effect of the outgassing temperature on BEA and BEATUD-1 after pyridine \n\nadsorption. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5.2- Acid properties measured by FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine of BEA and BEATUD-1 and \n\ncomparison with literature data. \n\nSample (Si/Al) Tads (\u00b0C) \nb\n T\n\n \ndes (\u00b0C) \n\nc\n [L]\n\nd \n\n\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5mol.g-1 \n[B]\n\ne \n\n\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5mol.g-1 \n[L]+[B] \n\n\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5mol.g-1 \n[L]/[B] \n\n \n\nRef \n\nBEA(12) 150 150 199 152 351 1.31 this work \n\nBeta(11.1) \na\n 147 147 382  513 895 0.75 \n\n222\n \n\nBEA(12.5) 150 150 240 580 820 0.41 \n163\n\n \n\nBEA(12.5) 450  450  400 320 720 1.25 \n178\n\n \n\nBEA(12.5) \na\n 170  170  190 153 343 1.23 \n\n227\n \n\nBEA(12.5) 350  350  - - - 0.16 \n233\n\n \n\nBeta(12.5) 150 150 248 96 344 2.58 \n234\n\n \n\nBeta(13.0) 250 250 128 180 308 0.71 \n235\n\n \n\nBeta(15.0) \na\n 200  200  469 372 841 0.83 (1.2)\n\n f\n \n\n226\n \n\nBeta(16.5) \na\n 180  180  100 194 294 0.52 (0.95) \n\nf\n \n\n231\n \n\nBeta(25) 200  200  - - - 1.33 \n236\n\n \n\nBeta(25) 152  152  151 150 301 0.50 \n191\n\n \n\nBeta(26.4) 150  150  340 315 655 1.08 \n225\n\n \n\nBeta(30) 200  200  269 66 335 4.08 \n229\n\n \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n237 \n\n \n\nTable 5.2- Continued. \nBeta(30.6) 200  200  - - - 2.99 \n\n70\n \n\nBeta(42) 150  150  107 189 296 0.57 \n92\n\n \n\nBeta(60) 350  350  - - - 0.66 \n232\n\n \n\nBEATUD-1(34) 150  150  114 95 209 1.19 this work \na) These values were converted to mmol.g\n\n-1\n considering that the values reported for unit cell were given per moles and considering \n\nthat the unit cell is dehydrated. b) Temperature of pyridine adsorption (Tads) used to determine Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acid sites \nconcentrations. c) Temperature of pyridine desorption (Tdes) used to determine Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acid sites concentrations. \nd) Concentration of Lewis acid sites, [L]. e) Concentration of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites [B]. f) Values in parenthesis were calculated according \nto the equation: (1.5x(AAbsB/AAbsL), where AAbsB/AAbsL is the absorbance area ratio and 1.5 is the extinction coefficient ratio (?L/?B). \n\n \n\n \n\nThe aluminium concentration in zeolite BEA (960 \u00b5mol.g-1, Table 5.1) was higher than the \n\ntotal number of AS (351 \u00b5mol.g-1, Table 5.2). This is consistent with the literature, which \n\nindicated that the number of AS is different from the total number of aluminium atoms present \n\nin the zeolite even when all their centres are accessible to pyridine.227 Gil et al.227 reported that \n\nthis can be due to the fact that zeolites are not perfect structures and therefore part of the \n\naluminium does not form the protonated Si-O-Al bridges: some form weak Al-OH groups or are \n\npresent as Lewis acid sites.  Lewis acid sites do not have infrared absorption bands however they \n\ncan be detected after adsorption of base molecules, e.g. pyridine.227 On the other hand, pyridine \n\nis a relatively strong base that can be protonated by Si-OH-Al groups, Si-OH or Al-OH.237 These \n\ntwo facts (possible formation of Al-OH groups or Lewis acid sites; and protonation of pyridine) \n\nact in opposite directions and the number of Br\u00f6nsted acid sites detected by pyridine adsorption \n\ndepends on the domination of one factor over the other.227 \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2.2.

A few examples are shown \n\nin Table 5.3. After comparing these results, it seems that the composite BEATUD-1 exhibited \n\nsuperior catalytic performance in the dehydration of Xyl to Fur under similar reaction conditions \n\n(0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v) biphasic solvent system, 160-170 \u00b0C). The catalytic performance of BEATUD-1 \n\nin terms of Fur yield compares quite favourably with all of the previously tested catalysts (74% YFur \n\ncompared to 28-48% YFur), even for H-Y Faujasite(5), H-Nu-6(2) and the delaminated zeolite del-\n\nNu-6(2) with similar CXyl (90-94%) at which 39-48% YFur were reached (Table 5.3). Decreasing the \n\namount of the catalyst in the reaction medium from 20 gBEATUD-1.dm\n-3 to 5 gBEATUD-1.dm\n\n-3 led to \n\nsomewhat lower YFur at 6 h (69 and 59%, respectively). More recently, Kim et al.\n239 reported for \n\nzeolite BEA(25) in the same reaction at 140 \u00b0C and under similar biphasic solvent conditions, 40% \n\nYFur (90% CXyl) at 4 h, exhibiting superior activity than that for zeolites H-Ferrierite(20), and H-\n\nMordenite(20), which gave 35% YHmf (ca. 80% CXyl) under similar reaction conditions. \n\nThe dehydration of Xyl in the presence of BEATUD-1 was carried out using solely water as \n\nthe solvent for comparison with the biphasic solvent system (Wt:Tol). A high CXyl of 81% was \n\nobtained at 6 h, but the YFur was poor (25%) in comparison to the Wt:Tol solvent system (69%, \n\nFigures 5.12- 5.14). Hence, the biphasic solvent system is beneficial, because the reaction of Xyl \n\n(insoluble in Tol) takes place only in the aqueous phase, and the in situ extraction of Fur from the \n\naqueous phase (containing Xyl and polar intermediates) into the organic phase may enhance       \n\nFur yields by avoiding its decomposition through consecutive reactions with intermediates in the \n\naqueous phase. The partition ratio of Fur (PRFur) calculated as indicated in equation 5.2 varied in \n\nthe range 8-10 for different reaction times (measured at a.t.). Hence, changes in the product \n\ndistribution with time did not significantly affect the partition ratio of Fur. Increasing the reaction \n\ntemperature in the range of 160-180 \u00b0C for the Wt:Tol system had a beneficial effect on initial \n\nreaction rate and Fur yield. Initial reaction rate (mmol.gcat\n-1.h-1) followed the order: 3.4 (160 \u00b0C) &lt;\n\n5.7 (170 \u00b0C) &lt;8.2 (180 \u00b0C), and Fur yield at 30 min of reaction followed the order: 4% (160 \u00b0C) &lt;\n\n14% (160 \u00b0C) &lt;14% (170 \u00b0C) &lt;27% (180 \u00b0C).

It is possible that the catalytic reaction took place on the internal \n\nand external surface of the BEA nanocrystallites (micropore volume was much lower than the \n\ntotal pore volume, Table 5.2). The initial reaction rate calculated on the basis of the mass of \n\ncatalyst (9.3 and 5.7 mmol.g-1.h-1 for BEA and BEATUD-1, respectively, Table 5.3) correlated with \n\nthe amount of AS in the catalysts, which was higher for BEA than for BEATUD-1 (351 and 209 \n\n\u00b5mol.g-1, respectively, Table 5.2);7 possibly the silica embedding the nanocrystallites may limit the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n242 \n \n\naccess to some of the AS. On the other hand, the initial reaction rate calculated on the basis of \n\nthe total amount of AS [L]+[B] was similar for BEA1.0 and  BEATUD-1 (26 and 27 mol.molL+B\n-1.h-1, \n\nrespectively). A 2.5-fold decrease in the mass of BEA used (experiment BEA0.4) led to lower CXyl at \n\n6 h than that for BEA1.0 (Figures 5.13 and 5.14), but a similar initial reaction rate (9.6 mmol.g-1.h-1 \n\nfor BEA0.4 compared to 9.3 mmol.g-1.h-1 for BEA1.0, Table 5.3). In the studied range of the \n\namount of the catalyst in the reaction medium (8-20 gBEA.dm\n-3), the plots of the Fur yield against \n\nXyl conversion were roughly coincident (Figure 5.14).  The reaction in the presence of the physical \n\nmixture BEA0.4/TUD0.6 took place at a similar rate to that for BEA0.4, suggesting that the \n\nreaction rate was essentially governed by the acid properties of the zeolite fraction. Furthermore, \n\nconsidering the plots of Fur yield against the conversion of Xyl, BEA0.4/TUD0.6 and BEA0.4 gave \n\nsimilar Fur yield for CXyl up to ca. 80%, and for higher conversions of Xyl slightly higher yields of Fur \n\nare reached for the physical mixture: 60 and 56% YFur at 97-98% CXyl for BEA0.4/TUD0.6 and \n\nBEA0.4, respectively. A significant improvement in the yield of Fur at higher conversion of Xyl, was \n\nobserved for the composite BEATUD-1, which gave 74% YFur, while BEA gave 54% for the same CXyl \n\nof 98% (Table 5.3). These improvements might be due to favourable competitive adsorption \n\neffects caused by the surrounding silica matrix in the zeolite nanocrystallites, minimising \n\nundesired reactions (the used BEATUD-1 catalyst contained a lower amount of carbonaceous \n\nmatter than BEA as discussed ahead in Section 5.2.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2.2.2. Identification of the reaction products \n\n \n\n \n\nDuring the reaction under study in the presence of BEATUD-1, the water and toluene \n\nphases turned yellow, suggesting the formation of by-products. As detailed in the Introduction \n\nSection 1.3, the reaction mechanism of the acid-catalysed conversion of Xyl to Fur involves a \n\nseries of elementary steps with the formation of three molecules of water per molecule of Fur \n\nformed, and several undesired side reactions may take place. \n\nThe HPLC analysis of the aqueous phase showed some minor peaks, which may include \n\nformic acid (based on the comparison of peak retention times with that for an authentic sample) \n\nformed by fragmentation reactions of Xyl.240 Oligo/polymeric by-products are also expected to be \n\nformed by condensation reactions through Fur intermediates.241 To test the stability of Fur under \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n243 \n\n \n\nthe reaction conditions used, the reaction was carried out with Fur as the substrate (instead of \n\nXyl) in the presence of BEA and gave 3% CFur at 6 h, suggesting that Fur is relatively stable.\n4  \n\nIn order to identify other possible by-products, the aqueous-phase was extracted with \n\ndichloromethane, giving a yellow solution, and then both of the organic phases were analysed by \n\nGC-MS. However, no major by-products were detected in the Tol phase or in the dichloromethane \n\nextract, which could be due to the soluble by-products being essentially of low volatility. To get \n\nsome insight into the nature of the soluble/low volatile by-products formed, the reaction of Xyl \n\nwas carried out in the presence of BEA using D2O as solvent instead of H2O, at 170 \u00b0C for 8 h. After \n\nseparating the solid catalyst, the reaction solution was analysed by 1H (Figure 5.15) and 13C NMR \n\nspectroscopy (Figure 5.16). \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.15- 1H NMR spectra of the solution obtained after separation of the solid phase from the \n\nreaction mixture of D-xylose (Xyl) in the presence of BEA using D2O as solvent (C).

Reaction conditions: D2O (1 cm\n3), 8 h, 170 \u00b0C,            \n\n20 gBEA.dm\n-3, 0.67 M Xyl. \n\n \n\n \n\nAs expected, the 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture showed four characteristic  \n\npeaks of Fur at 9.3 (H-1\u00b4), 7.8 (H-4), 7.4 (H-2) and 6.6 ppm (H-3) (Figure 5.15 C). In the 13C NMR \n\nspectrum, the five characteristic peaks of Fur were 184 (C-1\u2019), 157 (C-4), 155 (C-1), 128 (C-2) and \n\n116 ppm (C-3). According to Antal et al.240 Fur is probably formed from the cyclic form of Xyl, and \n\nthe open chain forms fragmentation products such as organic acids (e.g. lactic and formic) and \n\nglyceraldehyde. The 1H NMR spectrum of lactic acid is characterised by the presence of a signal at \n\n1.41\u00b10.1 ppm (as a doublet generated by the 3 protons of \u2013CH3 coupled to the proton -CH) and \n\nanother at 4.37 ppm (as a quartet generated by the proton \u2013CH coupled to the 3 protons of           \n\n\u2013CH3).\n242-245 In the 1H NMR spectrum obtained herein (Figure 5.15) signals appear at 1.2 ppm and \n\n4.2 ppm, which are more closely with those reported by Francisco et al.,246 who did not specify \n\nthe pD (~pH+0.41) (1.25 ppm due to the doublet and 4.21 ppm due to the quartet). Although the \n\nquartet resonance of lactic acid arising from its ?-proton is more sensitive to pD changes than the \n\ndoublet arising from the methyl group protons,243  the possibility that the signal at 1.2 ppm \n\n(Figure 5.15) is due to lactic acid cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, to be more certain, the pD of \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n245 \n\n \n\nthe reaction solution could have been measured and compared against a spectrum of lactic acid \n\nobtained at the same pD. \n\nThe intense signals at 8.07 ppm in the 1H NMR (Figure 5.15) and 168.9 ppm in the           \n\n13C NMR (Figure 5.16) can be assigned to formic acid. This is in agreement with the literature.247,248 \n\nIn sub/supercritical water conditions, organic acids may act as homogeneous catalysts in the \n\nreaction of Xyl.4,240,249 However it has been reported that even though formic acid and lactic acid \n\nare formed under sub/supercritical water conditions, they do not seem to play an important role \n\nin the decomposition of Fur because no noticeable changes in the Fur concentrations or solid \n\ndeposition were observed an hour after the formic acid was detected.4 \n\n Xyl, which is essentially in the pyranose form in D2O (Figure 5.15), was not detected in the \n\ncatalytic reaction mixture, indicating that the CXyl was 100%, consistent with the kinetic data \n\n(Table 5.3). \n\n Apart from the resonances due to Fur, formic acid and possibly lactic acid, the spectra of \n\nthe reaction mixture still exhibit numerous weak to very weak signals in the range of 3.3-4.3 ppm \n\n(?H) and 65-85 ppm (?C), which are typical regions for carbohydrate H-C-O or H2C-O groups; weak \n\npeaks at ?H &lt;2 ppm may be assigned to methyl or methylene carbon atoms. These signals were \n\nprobably due to fragmentation products of Xyl; however product identification was complicated \n\nby the overlapping of individual signals, especially in the 1H NMR spectrum. \n\n The presence of organic by-products was evident in the catalysts as the originally white \n\ncolour of BEATUD-1 and BEA powders changed to brown during the catalytic reaction, and \n\nremained so after washing with toluene, methanol, ethanol and acetone.  In a study of the \n\nreaction of Xyl in the presence of H-ZSM-5, O\u2019Neill et al.4 concluded that H-ZSM-5 sample tested \n\npossessed relatively large pores of 1.2 nm. According to the authors this value does not represent \n\nthe effective pore size of H-ZSM-5 but represents an estimate of the average pore size, reflecting \n\nthe contribution of the external surface to the total surface (internal plus external). The high value \n\nof the pore size could possible indicate the co-existence of two phases: one crystalline with \n\nmicroporous characteristics and the other with more open porosity.4 Consequently Fur (0.57 nm) \n\nwould have a longer residence time in the pore structure, allowing Fur rearrangements to form \n\noligomers (with possible furan-ring cleavage). These oligomers led to large molecules (coke) not \n\nable to diffuse easily in and out of the channels becoming entrapped in the porous structure, and \n\ncausing pore blockage and passivation of the catalyst surface (\u201cpoisoning\u201d of AS).4 Accordingly, \n\nFur loss reactions can lead to the formation of bulky by-products. In the case of zeolite \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n246 \n \n\nnanocrystallites it is possible that coke was formed on the internal (strongly adsorbed and/or \n\nentrapped) and external surfaces (strongly adsorbed). \n\nIn order to get more insight into the nature of the carbonaceous matter (verified by DSC \n\nand TGA measurements discussed in detail in the Section 5.2.2.3 \u201cCatalytic stability\u201d), the used \n\nBEA catalyst was characterised by 13C CP MAS NMR spectroscopy (Figure 5.17 C). The spectrum \n\nshowed peaks characteristic of Fur at 113, 117-137, 151 and 178 ppm. Besides Fur it was \n\nnoticeable the existence of other compounds by the presence of two very broad peaks centred at \n\n33 and 208 ppm, and several relatively narrow and weak peaks in the region 60-80 ppm. The two \n\nbroad peaks may correspond to saturated carbon-carbon bonds and aldehyde/ketone groups, \n\nrespectively, while the narrow peaks may be due to fragments related to Xyl. \n\n \n\n   \n\nFigure 5.17- 13C NMR spectrum of 2-furaldehyde (Fur) in DMSO-d6 (A);\n 13C NMR spectrum of the \n\nsolution obtained after washing the used BEA with DMSO-d6 (B); \n13C CP MAS NMR spectrum of \n\nBEA after catalysis using D2O as solvent (C).

A comparison with the liquid and solid 13C NMR \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n247 \n\n \n\nspectra indicated that the compounds which gave rise to the peaks centred at 33, 60-80 and      \n\n208 ppm in the MAS NMR spectrum of used BEA were not removed by washing with DMSO-d6, \n\nand were therefore essentially insoluble products. The liquid-state 13C NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6 \n\ncatalyst wash, Figure 5.17 B), exhibited the characteristic resonances of Fur (Figure 5.17 A) and \n\nextra lines at 21.4, 125.7, 128.6, 129.3 and 163.4 ppm. The signals between 125 and 130 ppm can \n\nbe assigned to alkenyl groups (RCH=CHR), while the single line at 21.4 ppm can be assigned to a \n\nmethyl or methylene carbon atom. These results were congruent with the appearance of several \n\noverlapping signals or multiplets in the region 7.1-7.3 ppm and a singlet at 2.30 ppm in the 1H \n\nNMR spectrum of DMSO-d6 catalyst wash (Figure 5.18).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.18- 1H NMR spectrum of the solution obtained after washing the used BEA with      \n\nDMSO-d6. Reaction conditions: D2O (1 cm\n3), 8 h, 170 \u00b0C, 20 gBEA.dm\n\n-3, 0.67 M Xyl.  \n\n \n\n \n\nMore elaborate characterisation studies are needed to identify the product(s) responsible \n\nfor these signals. Furthermore, the weak line that appears at 163.4 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum \n\nfor the catalyst wash (Figure 5.17 B) and at 8.1 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum for the same sample \n\n(Figure 5.15) was assigned to a residual amount of formic acid. It was noteworthy that the \n\nresonances between 125 and 130 ppm (13C NMR spectrum of DMSO-d6 catalyst wash) matched \n\nwith the fairly narrow peak at 128.5 ppm and the shoulder at 125.7 ppm in the 13C CP MAS NMR \n\nspectrum of the used BEA (prior to washing with DMSO-d6, Figure 5.17 C). \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n248 \n \n\nThe FT-IR spectra of the as-prepared and used BEA were quite similar (Figure 5.19) with \n\nthe main difference being the appearance of a new band centred at ca. 1700 cm-1 which may be \n\nassigned to the aldehyde/ketone groups that gave rise to the broad signal at ca. 208 ppm in the  \n\n13C CP MAS NMR spectrum of the recovered BEA (Figure 5.17 C). A very weak band at                   \n\nca. 1470 cm-1 was also observed which may be due to Fur or related by-products. The failure to \n\nobserve additional IR bands from by-products may be due to the overlap of these bands with the \n\nmore intense bands of the aluminosilicate matrix, as well as to the low concentration and/or the \n\namorphous and complex chemical nature of the by-products. The comparison of the FT-IR spectra \n\nof the as-prepared and used BEA suggested that the chemical nature of BEA was essentially \n\npreserved under the applied hydrothermal reaction conditions. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 5.19- FT-IR spectra of BEA before and after reaction of D-xylose (Xyl) using D2O as solvent. \n\nReaction conditions: D2O (1 cm\n3), 8 h, 170 \u00b0C, 20 gBEA.dm\n\n-3,0.67 M Xyl. The spectra of D-xylose (Xyl) \n\nand 2-furaldehyde (Fur) are given for comparison. \n\n \n \n\nOverall, it seems that the carbonaceous matter contained aldehyde/ketone groups, \n\nfragments related to Xyl and (un)saturated carbon-carbon bonds, which were possible to extract \n\nwith DMSO. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n249 \n\n \n\n5.2.2.3.

Figure 5.20 shows the DSC curves for BEATUD-1 and \n\nBEA. The presence of organic matter in the four samples was confirmed by DSC, which showed \n\nexothermic features above 200 \u00b0C (not observed for the as-prepared samples). An endothermic \n\npeak was detected below 200 \u00b0C, attributed to desorption of physisorbed water and volatiles. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.20- DSC curves for fresh BEA and BEATUD-1 and after 98% of D-xylose conversion (CXyl). \n\nReaction conditions: 0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v) biphasic solvent system, 170 \u00b0C, 20 gBEA.dm\n-3,  0.67 M Xyl. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe amount of carbonaceous matter of the samples recovered, washed and dried at       \n\n65 \u00b0C, was estimated from the TGA curves in the temperature range of 200-600 \u00b0C by calculating \n\nthe weight loss in this range. No significant variation in mass was observed for the as-prepared \n\nmaterials, whereas for the recovered solids, these values gave 24, 31 and 15 wt.% for BEA0.4, \n\nBEA1.0 and BEATUD-1 solids, respectively. Hence, BEATUD-1 possessed the lowest amount of \n\ncarbonaceous matter and gave the highest YFur (74%) at high CXyl (98%). \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n250 \n \n\nTo examine the reusability of BEA and BEATUD-1 catalysts, a total of four consecutive  6 h \n\nbatch runs were carried out (details about the catalyst regeneration procedure applied after each \n\nbatch run are described in the experimental part, Chapter 2). As shown in Figure 5.21, the \n\nconversion of Xyl and the yield of Fur at 6 h reaction remained fairly constant for the consecutive \n\nruns. The powder XRD patterns of the as-prepared and used catalysts were similar (Figure 5.4), as \n\nwere the Si/Al ratios determined by ICP-AES (33 and 13 for recovered BEATUD-1 and BEA, \n\nrespectively). These results suggested that BEA and BEATUD-1 were quite stable under the \n\napplied reaction conditions. The total Fur productions for the four runs were of 20 and 29 \n\nmmolFur.gcat\n-1 for BEA and BEATUD-1, respectively (theoretical value, 100% YFur=40 mmolFur.gcat\n\n-1). \n\nWhen BEATUD-1 was recovered without applying the thermal treatment and reused in a second \n\nrun, the yield of Furr at 6 h decreased by a factor of ca. 1.8, revealing the negative effect of coke \n\non Fur production. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.21- Catalytic performance of BEA and BEATUD-1 in four consecutive 6 h batch runs. \n\nReaction conditions: 0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v) biphasic solvent system, 8 h, 170 \u00b0C, 20 gBEA.dm\n-3,        \n\n0.67 M Xyl. \n\n \n\n\n\nZeolite BEA and composite BEATUD-1 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n251 \n\n \n\n5.3. Conclusions \n\n \n\n \n\nThe composite BEATUD-1 consisting of commercial nanocrystalline zeolite BEA in the \n\nprotonic form incorporated in a TUD-1 mesoporous matrix (denoted BEATUD-1) was an efficient \n\ncatalyst for the acid catalysed conversion of Xyl into Fur, without the need for catalyst \n\nreplacement during at least four runs (similar yields of Fur were reached). In comparison to the \n\nbulk nanocrystalline zeolite BEA, BEATUD-1 gave a lower reaction rate (on the same catalyst mass \n\nbasis), which correlated with the lower total amount of AS ([L]+[B]) of BEATUD-1 in comparison to \n\nBEA. Initial reaction rate was ca. 9.3 mmol.gcat\n-1.h-1 for BEA and 5.7 mmol.gcat\n\n-1.h-1 for BEATUD-1 \n\n(on the basis of total amount of acid sites, the initial reaction rates were similar for the two \n\ncatalysts, ca. 27 mol.molL+B\n-1.h-1).  \n\nThe catalyst stability of BEA seemed as good as that for BEATUD-1. However, the yield of   \n\nFur at very high CXyl (98%) was higher for BEATUD-1 (74%) than for bulk BEA (54%) or the physical \n\nmixture consisting of BEA plus TUD-1 silica (60%). On the other hand, the amount of \n\ncarbonaceous matter was lower for BEATUD-1 than for BEA. Based on solid- and liquid-state NMR \n\nstudies it seemed that carbonaceous matter contained aldehyde/ketone groups, Xyl-related \n\nfragments and (un)saturated carbon-carbon bonds.  \n\nThe improved performance of the composite BEATUD-1 may be due to favourable \n\ncompetitive adsorption effects caused by the surrounding silica matrix. Catalytic tests showed \n\nthat the strong adsorption/entrapment of organic matter in the catalyst had a major negative \n\neffect on the catalytic performance, although this drawback can be successfully overcome by, for \n\nexample, thermally regenerating the catalyst. \n\nFurther improvements in the catalytic performance for composites of the type BEATUD-1 \n\nmay be possible by fine-tuning properties such as the Si/Al ratio, which can change the total \n\namount of AS and catalyst surface polarity, and the zeolite loading, which may affect the \n\ndispersion and the number of accessible AS of the zeolite. Alternatively, the preparation of zeolite \n\ncatalysts with significantly enhanced external specific surface area may allow improved catalytic \n\nperformances. In this sense in the next Chapter it was studied the catalytic performance of the \n\nhigh external surface area ITQ-2, obtained by delamination of a layered precursor of zeolite MCM-\n\n22. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n252 \n \n\n5.4.

Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nPorous aluminosilicates are promising solid acid catalysts in the dehydration of Xyl to Fur. \n\nThey exhibit catalytic activity in acid catalysed reactions and fulfill important requirements that \n\nare put on solid acid catalysts, such as being water-tolerant (minimal levelling-off of the acid \n\nstrength in water), hydrothermally stable (crystalline structure integrity and stability towards \n\nmetal leaching) and presenting a good thermal stability when the catalyst regeneration requires \n\nthermal decomposition of accumulated carbonaceous deposits (typically in the range 350-550 \u00b0C), \n\nor chemical stability if carbonaceous deposits are to be removed by harsh chemical treatments \n\n(e.g. liquid-phase oxidising conditions),2,3 as mentioned in Chapter 1. From the literature data, \n\nother families of porous inorganic solids can be pointed as fairly robust materials for this catalytic \n\napplication, but aluminosilicates (bulk catalysts) in particular are relatively cheap and versatile \n\nmaterials with respect to the type of crystallinity and pore structures (micro/meso/macropores;   \n\n1 D, 2 D or 3 D pore systems), acid properties and surface polarity (varying the Si/Al ratio), and \n\npossibility of being prepared with particle/crystallite sizes down to the nano-scale.  \n\nMicroporous 3 D structures impose size constraints on the reactants, intermediates and \n\nproducts.  In a pioneering work by Moreau et al.,4 zeolites revealed to be effective solid acids for \n\nthe conversion of saccharides into Fur; in the case of H-Mordenite and H-Y Faujasite with Si/Al \n\natomic ratio in the range 2-15, 90-96% SFur was reached at 27-37% CXyl at 170 \u00b0C, although \n\nselectivity dropped considerably as conversion increased.4 O\u2019Neill et al.5 found a similar trend in \n\nFur selectivity with conversion of Xyl for zeolite ZSM-5 as catalyst, and explained these results on \n\nthe basis of enhanced Fur loss reactions inside the pore system, which may eventually cause pore \n\nblockage and deactivation of the catalyst. Accordingly, efforts have been focused on increasing \n\npore sizes, allowing a wider application of these materials in fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and \n\npetrochemical industries. Various synthetic approaches have improved the catalytic performance \n\nof zeolites, such as decreasing the zeolite crystallite sizes to the nano scale to increase the specific \n\nsurface/pore volume ratio (as discussed in previous Chapter 5) and delaminating lamellar \n\nprecursors of zeolites into aggregates of sheets with zeolitic nature and enhanced specific surface \n\narea.6  In this Chapter, H-MCM-22 zeolite possessing a medium-pore framework (MWW) and its \n\ndelaminated counterpart, were tested as catalysts in the dehydration of Xyl into Fur. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n268 \n \n\n6.1.1. Zeolite H-MCM-22  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe zeolite H-MCM-22 possesses a 3 D MWW-type framework (Figures 6.1 and 6.2) and \n\nwas discovered by Mobil in 1990.7 Like zeolite beta (discussed in the previous Chapter) MCM-22 \n\nbelongs to the group of high silica zeolites (Si/Al ? 10) and crystallises in the form of thin \n\nplatelets.1,8 It presents a complex pore system characterised by the presence of both medium and \n\nlarge pores,9 in which the internal MWW-type structure consists of two independent pore \n\nsystems, both accessible only through 10-membered ring apertures (10-MR),1,8,10,11 and specific \n\nsurface area is commonly in the range11 300-500 m2.g-1. The first pore system is 3 D, formed by \n\nMWW large super cages (with an inner free diameter of ca. 7.1 \u00c5 and with an unusually large \n\ninner height of 18.2 \u00c5) and composed of 12-MR, only accessible through elliptical 10-MR \n\napertures (4.0X5.5 \u00c5).1,11-13 The [001] plane of MCM-22 crystals are terminated by open (half-cut) \n\nMWW cages (pores in the form of cups).8 The aluminium sites in these cups give rise to strong \n\nacid sites on the external surface, similar to the Br\u00f6nsted acid sites on the internal surface.12-16 \n\nThe second pore system is defined by a 2 D circular 10-MR sinusoidal channel system with a \n\nuniform diameter (4.1x5.1 \u00c5) throughout the structure (medium-pore),1 and does not contain \n\ncages.13 The two pore systems are independent.13  \n\nThe acid sites on the external surface of MCM-22 can be accessed by relatively bulky \n\norganic molecules, making MCM-22 an interesting catalyst for a wide variety of reactions.13 \n\nHence, the distribution of the framework aluminium atoms and acidic hydroxyl groups of the \n\nMWW-type framework structures are particularly interesting.1 The properties of MCM-22 zeolite \n\nmay be influenced by several factors, such as the synthesis method and conditions (variation of \n\nthe silica gel composition),10,17 having a strong impact on crystal size and morphology.18  \n\nMCM-22 had been proposed with both hexagonal and orthorhombic forms;10,19 Kennedy \n\net al.20 determined by NMR studies that for highly-siliceous zeolites the orthorombic one is \n\nfavoured with 13 non-equivalent tetrahedral sites, that can be Si or Al. According to Kennedy et \n\nal.19 the Al-O bonds (1.75 \u00c5 in length) are longer than Si-O (1.61 \u00c5 in length).  \n\nMCM-22 zeolite can be formed via two different synthesis methods,21 either by \n\ncalcination of a lamellar precursor herein denoted as Pre-MCM-22, during which, the OH groups \n\ncondense in the lamellar layers to form the 3 D MWW-type framework structure;22 or \n\nalternatively by direct hydrothermal synthesis from a synthesis gel (which is typical for zeolites).21 \n\nThe Pre-MCM-22 already contains the sinusoidal system within hexagonal individual layers \n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n \n\n(thickness of ca. 25 \u00c5) perpendicularly aligned to the central axis z and separated by the organic \n\ntemplate hexamethyleneimine.\n\n \n\nFigure 6.1- Structures of MWW\n\n[100] (B).26 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2- Structure of MWW\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nperpendicularly aligned to the central axis z and separated by the organic \n\ntemplate hexamethyleneimine.7,22-25 \n\n  \n\nStructures of MWW-type framework projected along [001] (A), and \n\n    \n\nStructure of MWW-type framework viewed normal to [001].26 \n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n269 \n\nperpendicularly aligned to the central axis z and separated by the organic \n\n \n\ntype framework projected along [001] (A), and projected along \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n270 \n \n\n6.1.2.

Results and discussion \n\n \n\n6.2.1. Catalyst characterisation \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this Chapter (Na,H)-MCM-22(X) and ITQ-2(24) materials were prepared as described in \n\nthe literature (Chapter 2).31,32 Na-MCM-22(X) materials were obtained through calcination of the \n\npreviously prepared Pre-MCM-22(X), which were prepared as described in the literature,30,31 using \n\nsodium aluminate and silica (as aluminium and silicon sources) and hexamethyleneimine as the \n\norganic template; X (the atomic ratio of Si/Al) was determined to be of 24 and 38 by ICP-AES \n\nmeasurements. ITQ-2(24) was prepared by delamination of Pre-MCM-22(30), by the addition of \n\naqueous cetyltrimethyl-ammonium hydroxide/bromide (prepared by ion-exchange of CTMABr \n\nusing Amberlite IRA-400 (OH)) and aqueous tetrapropylammonium hydroxide/bromide. \n\n The ion-exchange and calcination treatments applied to Na-MCM-22(24) and Na-MCM-\n\n22(38) to give H-MCM-22(24) and H-MCM-22(38), respectively, did not affect the Si/Al atomic \n\nratio.  \n\nThe delamination procedure applied to Pre-MCM-22(30) gave the material ITQ-2(24) with \n\na slightly lower Si/Al atomic ratio, possibly due to slight dissolution of silica during the \n\ndelamination process.42,43 \n\n \n\nThe powder XRD patterns of the (Na,H)-MCM-22 samples obtained are in good agreement \n\nwith the literature data for a MWW-type framework topology (Figure 6.5).10,12,13,17,23,29,31,36,39,44-98 \n\nThe XRD pattern of ITQ-2(24) revealed a significant reduction in the long-range order as a result of \n\nthe delamination procedure, in agreement with the literature data. 29,31,36,41-43,46,51,53,56,73,83,93,99-101 \n\n \n\n\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n273 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.5- Powder XRD patterns of as-prepared H-MCM-22(24) and ITQ-2(24) and the \n\ncorresponding used/calcined (after catalysis) solids. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe SEM analyses showed that the (Na,H)-MCM-22 samples consisted of thin plate-like \n\ncrystallites of a few hundreds of nanometers to ca. 1 \u00b5m wide, and ITQ-2(24) consisted of \n\nparticles of irregular shapes (exemplified for Na-MCM-22(24) and ITQ-2(24), Figure 6.6 and for H-\n\nMCM-22(24) and H-MCM-22(38), Figure 6.7). A platelet-like morphology for MCM-22 was also \n\nobserved by other authors. Some of them reported sizes ?  1 \u00b5m in length,46,74,85,87,88,102,103 in \n\nagreement to the findings in this work. Others found the same platelet-like morphology for MCM-\n\n22 but for sizes >1 \u00b5m.17,47,55,61-63,72,75,90,95,96,104-111 Smie\u0161kov\u00e1 et al.112 reported that MCM-22 \n\nconsisted of clusters composed of platelet type particles of about  ? 1 \u00b5m in length. Other \n\nmorphologies were observed by other authors for MCM-22 such as circular crystals, with \n\ndiameters of 0.8-1 \u00b5m for MCM-22(50) and much smaller (0.03-0.05 \u00b5m) for MCM-22(15), in \n\naccordance with the higher crystallinity of MCM-22(50) and higher external surface area of MCM-\n\n22(15) (141 m2.g-1 compared to 97 m2.g-1 for MCM-22(50)),88 hollow spheres with 6-7 \u00b5m in \n\ndiameter,51 spheres with a hole inside with diameters from 1-2 \u00b5m,60,77 3-10 \u00b5m,100,113 and 13-16 \n\n\u00b5m, 67,68 hexagonal lamellar crystals with lengths of ca. 0.5-0.6 \u00b5m,74 and crystal chips with \n\ndiameters of 5-10 \u00b5m.59 A not well defined sheet for MCM-22 with 5 \u00b5m in length was reported.13 \n\nThe irregular particle shapes typical of ITQ-2 were confirmed before (with loss of the platelet \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n274 \n \n\nmorphology of MCM-22(P)).43,54 In contrast, ITQ-2 consisted of thin platelets similar to MCM-22, \n\nbut with the formation of more agglomerates or more fragments.46,114 Similar to what some \n\nauthors observed for MCM-22, hollow spheres were also observed for ITQ-2 but with more \n\nfragments,51 or spheres with smaller diameters of 1 \u00b5m when compared to MCM-22 (3-10 \u00b5m).100  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 6.6- SEM images of a) Na-MCM-22(24) and b) ITQ-2(24). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.7- SEM images of a) H-MCM-22(24) and b) H-MCM-22(38). \n\n\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n275 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.8 shows a representative HRTEM image of Na-MCM-22(24) crystallite viewed \n\nalong the 10-MR channels (bright spots), perpendicular to the z-direction. The images generally \n\nshowed the stacking of MWW sheets with a thickness ranging from 150 to 300 nm, corresponding \n\nto the thickness of the platelet crystals. As expected, the 10-MR channels were separated by         \n\n1.2 nm, and the thickness of the layers was ca. 2.5 nm. MWW sheets with different ranges of \n\nthickness were reported. A few authors reported sheets with thickness of 100-500 nm (similar to \n\nthe obtained in this work),55,75,96,108 others in the range of 1000-2500 nm,63,105 others reported \n\nsheets with less than 100 nm of thickness,74,87,88,102 or even smaller ( ?50 nm).74,85,103 HRTEM \n\nimages of ITQ-2(24) showed much more fragmented crystals consisting of fewer sheets than Na-       \n\nMCM-22(24), and even single layers of 2.5 nm thickness (Figure 6.8 b).

The higher specific surface area was always \n\nobserved for the delaminated ITQ-2 (623-895 m2.g-1) compared to (Na,H)-MCM-22 materials (401-\n\n597 m2.g-1 and Si/Al ratio between 7-29; 329-456 m2.g-1 and Si/Al ratio between 40-50). Even the \n\nlower ITQ-2 surface areas reported (468-560 m2.g-1) were higher than the MCM-22 counterparts \n\n(e.g. 560 m2.g-1 obtained for ITQ-2 and 451 m2.g-1 for MCM-22)93 (Table 6.1). Exceptionally, a \n\n\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n279 \n\n \n\nhigher surface area was observed for MCM-22 (654 m2.g-1) by  Laredo et al.44 In general, the SEXT \n\nfor ITQ-2 (268-790 m2.g-1) was high compared to (Na,H)-MCM-22  materials (68-150 m2.g-1), and \n\nthe Vmicro values were normally higher for MCM-22 materials (0.11 to 0.24 cm\n3.g-1) than in ITQ-2 \n\n(0.01-0.08 cm3.g-1). Liu et al.100 reported a low Smeso of 175 m\n2.g-1 for ITQ-2, which probably is an \n\nindication of an unsuccessful delamination. Yang et al.46 reported the same value of Vmicro for    \n\nITQ-2 and MCM-22 (0.16 cm3.g-1), however the Vmeso of the former was ca. 2.3 times greater   \n\n(0.57 cm3.g-1) than the latter (0.24 cm3.g-1), which is consistent with the mesoporosity associated \n\nwith ITQ-2 and observed through the nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Figure 6.9).  \n\n \n\nThe 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the Na-MCM-22 samples exhibited an asymmetric peak with \n\nmaximum at ca. 56 ppm and a shoulder at ca. 50 ppm (Figure 6.11), assigned to tetrahedrally \n\ncoordinated framework aluminium (denoted Alfr), which may have non-equivalent chemical \n\nenvironments with different T-O-T angles.19,37,41,99,140 The tetrahedral aluiminium at ca. 50 ppm \n\nwas assigned to aluminium atoms in sites T6 and T7,1,17,37,51 while the peak at 56 ppm was \n\nassigned to T1-T5 and T8, since T6 and T7 have larger T-O-T angles,51 or only T1, T3, T4, T5 and T8           \n\n(Figure 6.12).1,17,19,37  The average Al-O-Si angles in the zeolite framework of 152\u00b0 and 164\u00b0 were \n\nassigned for the chemical shifts at ca. 55 ppm and ca. 48 ppm respectively.141 This spectrum is in \n\nagreement with the literature for MCM-22 before calcination.1,10,19,23,37,43,49,51,59,76,98,140,142 Other \n\nauthors observed a single peak at 54 ppm, associated with Alfr  in tetrahedral environment and \n\nindicating that aluminium was effectively incorporated in the silica framework.143,144 In the \n\npresent work, the spectra of the H-MCM-22 samples exhibited an additional (narrow, weaker) \n\npeak at ca. 0 ppm, assigned to extra-framework aluminium species (denoted Alext-fr) formed during \n\nthe ion-exchange/calcination treatments,91,99,133 which is similar to that reported in the \n\nliterature.17,19,23,47,51,61,78,79,91,94,132,133,142,145-147 An additional peak at 61 ppm was reported \n\nsometimes as a shoulder of the ca. 50 and 55 ppm peaks assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated \n\nAlfr,\n19,23,142,147,148 and to T2 sites.7 Delitala et al.17 identified a peak at ca. 30 ppm that was \n\nattributed to distorted tetrahedral or pentacoordinated Alext-fr. Similar peak at ca. 30 ppm was also \n\nobserved by other authors.78,94,148  \n\nThe relative amounts of the Alfr and Alext-fr species were determined from the areas of the \n\nrespective peaks (A(Alfr)= area of the peak in the range of 35-70 ppm; A(Alext-fr)= area of the peak \n\ncentred at 0 ppm). The ratio A(Alfr)/A(Alext-fr) equals 8.4 for H-MCM-22(24) and 9.4 for H-MCM-\n\n22(38). These results are in agreement with the literature data in that higher Si/Al ratios of H-\n\nMCM-22 can lead to higher relative amounts of tetrahedral aluminium.1,43,133 The 27Al NMR \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n280 \n \n\nspectrum of ITQ-2(24) revealed the presence of Alfr (ca. 55 ppm) and Alext-fr species (0 ppm), in \n\nagreement with the literature data.43,51,99  \n\nThe A(Alfr)/A(Alext-fr) ratio for ITQ-2(24) was equal to 8.5 which was similar to that \n\nobserved for its counterpart H-MCM-22(24).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.11- 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the prepared catalysts (Na,H)-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.12- Schematic representation of non-equivalent tetrahedral positions in one layer of \n\nMCM-22 .

In the case of ITQ-2(24) the presence of Si-OH \n\nterminal groups was evident by the presence of an intense band at 3743 cm-1 (Figure 6.13). The \n\npresence of Si-OH groups was also observed in the case of the zeolite H-MCM-22(24) and             \n\nH-MCM-22(38), although with much lower relative intensities (Figure 6.14). The ratio between the \n\nintensities of FT-IR bands due to acidic groups depends on the zeolite composition, preparation \n\nprocedure, and subsequent thermal treatment conditions.153,154  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n282 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.14- FT-IR spectra of ITQ-2(24), H-MCM-22(24) and H-MCM-22(38) after pyridine \n\nadsorption and outgassing at 150 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\nAll the prepared materials possessed both B and L interacting with pyridine after \n\noutgassing at 150 \u00b0C.

In this sense, the [B] (band at ca. 1545 cm-1) and [L] (band at ca. 1450 \n\ncm-1) for ITQ-2(24) and H-MCM-22 were determined through equations 3.1 and 3.2, specified in \n\nChapter 3 (Table 6.2). Figure 6.15 shows the FT-IR spectra of the catalysts with adsorbed pyridine, \n\nafter outgassing at 150 \u00b0C.

The H-MCM-22(24) sample possessed higher total amount of \n\n([L]+[B]) in comparison to H-MCM-22(38), which was consistent with the lower Si/Al ratio for the \n\nformer (Table 6.2), and with the literature for two MCM-22 samples with different Si/Al ratios \n\n(total acidity of 78.2 mmol.g-1 for MCM-22(15) and of 41 mmol.g-1 for MCM-22(50) after pyridine \n\noutgassing at 250 \u00b0C).88 The ITQ-2(24) sample possessed a similar total amount of acid sites (AS) to                         \n\nH-MCM-22(24), while the [L]/[B] ratio was higher for ITQ-2(24) (a similar trend has been reported \n\nin the literature30). \n\nThe effect of the outgassing temperature on the [L] and [B] was also investigated, and a \n\ndecrease in the amount of detected AS was observed with an increase in outgassing temperature. \n\nThe ratios of the amounts of AS measured at 150 \u00b0C and 250 \u00b0C ([L]150/[L]250 and [B]150/[B]250) were \n\nboth equal to 1.1 for H-MCM-22(24), whereas for ITQ-2(24) [L]150/[L]250=1.4 and [B]150/[B]250=2.6. \n\nHence, the surface acidity (particularly the Br\u00f6nsted acidity) for ITQ-2(24) was weaker. \n\nThe [L]/[B] ratio for these types of materials reported in the literature (pyridine \n\nadsorption in a temperature range of 100 to 200 \u00b0C) is given in Table 6.2; in general for                 \n\nH-MCM-22, [B] was greater than [L]; exceptions were reported by Ling et al.,132 and Wang et al.56 \n\nThe higher [L]+[B] seemed to be correlated to the higher aluminium content, as observed for H-\n\nMCM-22(24)(204 \u00b5mol.g-1) in comparison to H-MCM-22(38) (168 \u00b5mol.g-1), and literature data for \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n284 \n \n\nH-MCM-22 with lower Si/Al ratios of 15-19 (411-457 \u00b5mol.g-1).44,56,61  The same trend was reported \n\nfor ITQ-2(24) and ITQ-2(19),56 in which the total amount of AS were 198 and 276 \u00b5mol.g-1, \n\nrespectively (Table 6.2).

Due to its steric bulk (ca. 7.4 \u00c5), the collidine molecule is not \n\nexpected to enter the pores of the MWW-type framework structure,156,157 meaning it should only \n\ninteract with B (giving [B]col) located on the external surface or at the pore entrances. On the \n\nother hand, collidine is a stronger base (pKa ca. 7.4) than pyridine (pKa ca. 5.3).158 The [B]col for    \n\nH-MCM-22(24) and ITQ-2(24) was 45 and 153 \u00b5mol.g-1, respectively (the reproducibility was \n\nchecked in duplicate experiments). The lower [B]col for H-MCM-22(24) than for ITQ-2(24) is most \n\nlikely due to steric constraints (inaccessibility of the AS on the internal surface to the bulky \n\ncollidine molecules). For ITQ-2(24), [B]col was greater than [B] determined using pyridine, most \n\nlikely due to the fact that collidine is a stronger base than pyridine and thus it interacts with AS \n\nwhich were too weak for interaction with pyridine. Based on the above results, it seems that \n\nwhile the delamination procedure led to enhanced surface area of ITQ-2(24), the surface acidity \n\nbecame relatively weak. \n\n\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n285 \n\n \n\n6.2.2.

Catalytic performance of H-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) in water-organic \n\nbiphasic solvent system \n\n \n\n \n\nThe catalysts were tested in the aqueous-phase reaction of Xyl to give Fur, using a \n\nbiphasic solvent system (0.3 water:0.7 toluene (v/v), denoted Wt:Tol), at 170 \u00b0C. As mentioned \n\nbefore, Xyl dissolves completely in water and is insoluble in toluene, whereas Fur is distributed in \n\nthe two liquid phases with a partition ratio in the range of 8-10, at a.t. calculated through \n\nequation 5.2 described in Chapter 5. Hence, the use of Tol as co-solvent allows the simultaneous \n\nextraction of Fur as it is formed, into the upper organic phase, which may avoid consecutive Fur \n\nloss reactions. The reaction of Xyl in the presence of H-MCM-22(24) gave 70% of YFur at 92% CXyl, \n\nreached at 16 h (Figures 6.16 and 6.17). The kinetic curves for H-MCM-22(24) and its parent basic \n\nform, Na-MCM-22(24), were roughly coincident (Figure 6.16); the initial reaction rate for                 \n\nH-MCM-22(24) and Na-MCM-22(24) was 2.4 and 2.9 mmol.gcat\n-1.h-1, respectively (based on the \n\nconversion of Xyl after 1 h of reaction). However, higher yields of Fur were reached for                     \n\nH-MCM-22(24) than for Na-MCM-22(24) (Figure 6.17). In the case of Na-MCM-22(38) the initial \n\nreaction rate was very poor (only 0.84 mmol.gcat\n-1.h-1; slower than Na-MCM-22(24)). At 24 h of \n\nreaction the CXyl/YFur was 98%/47% for Na-MCM-22(24), 87%/51% for Na-MCM-22(38) and \n\n82%/60% for H-MCM-22(38). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n286 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.16- Kinetic profiles of the reaction of D-xylose (Xyl) in the presence of Na-MCM-22(24) \n\n(?), H-MCM-22(24) (x), H-MCM-22(38) (+) or ITQ-2(24) (?).

For H-MCM-22(38), \n\nthe initial reaction rate was 1.0 mmol.gcat\n-1.h-1 (compared to 2.4 mmol.gcat\n\n-1.h-1 for H-MCM-22(24)), \n\nand a 71% CXyl was reached at 16 h of reaction (Figure 6.16). The higher catalytic activity observed \n\nfor H-MCM-22(24) (92% CXyl at 16 h compared to 82% CXyl at 24 h for H-MCM-22(38)) correlated \n\nwith the higher total amount of acid sites determined by FT-IR studies of adsorbed pyridine \n\n(Tables 6.2 and 6.3). The yield of Fur reached at ca. 98% CXyl was 68% for H-MCM-22(38) and 71% \n\nfor H-MCM-22(24) (Figure 6.17). Hence, the decrease in the Si/Al ratio of the H-MCM-22 zeolite \n\nled to an increase in the total amount of AS which, in turn, improved the catalytic activity in the \n\nreaction of Xyl, without affecting significantly the Fur selectivity. \n\nThe catalytic activity of (medium-pore) H-MCM-22(24) was intermediate (92% CXyl, 16 h) \n\nbetween that previously reported for the small-pore zeolite H-Nu-6 (2) (Si/Al=32), (59% CXyl, 6 h),\n6 \n\nand large-pore zeolite BEA (Si/Al=12) (98% CXyl at 4 h, in Chapter 5), used as catalysts in the same \n\nreaction under similar conditions (Table 6.3). Nevertheless, the maximum yield of Fur reached \n\nwas highest for H-MCM-22(24). For comparison, the reaction of Xyl was carried out, under similar \n\nreaction conditions, in the presence of the protonic form of a commercial sample of ZSM-5 (Alfa \n\nAsear; ammonium form; Si/Al=11.5, 425 m2.g-1), which is a medium-pore zeolite with the MFI \n\nframework type. The acquired zeolite was heated under static air at a rate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1 to 550 \u00b0C, \n\nand maintained at this temperature for 10 h, giving the tested H-ZSM-5(11.5). The CXyl and YFur at  \n\n6 h/16 h were 88%/98% and 60%/61%, respectively. Compared with the prepared H-MCM-22  \n\nsamples, the H-ZSM-5(11.5) catalyst was more active (for the more active H-MCM-22(24), \n\n73%/92% CXyl at 6 h/16 h), but led to lower yields of Fur at high conversions (at ca. 98% CXyl: 71%, \n\n69% and 61% YFur for H-MCM-22(24), H-MCM-22(38), and H-ZSM-5(11.5), respectively). O\u2019 Neill   \n\net al.5 investigated the reaction of Xyl in the presence of H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al=28. In that study, a \n\nmaximum of ca. 33% YFur was reached within 60 min, at 180 \u00b0C, and afterwards the yield of Fur \n\ntended to drop with time (reaction conditions: 0.67 M Xyl and 30 gcat.dm\n-3) under pressurised He \n\natmosphere. The yield of Fur reported for the reaction temperature of 160 \u00b0C was lower (ca. 12% \n\nYFur at 1 h).  \n\nThe presence of basic sites in the catalysts can promote undesirable reactions such as the \n\naldolisation decomposition of the saccharide into oligomeric acid products.159,160 Particularly in \n\nthe investigated catalyst H-ZSM-5, the average pore size was ca. 1.2 nm which is far greater than \n\nthe molecular diameters of both Xyl and Fur, and this was considered as a possible cause of the \n\nformation of considerable amounts of by-products (oligomers).5   \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n288 \n \n\nThe results obtained for (Na-H)-MCM-22 samples compared favourably in terms of yield \n\nof Fur to the zeolites H-Mordenite or H-Y Faujasite tested under similar conditions in previously \n\nreported works (Table 6.3). \n\n \n\nTable 6.3- Catalytic performance of prepared catalysts in the reaction of D-xylose (Xyl), using a \n\nbiphasic solvent system (Wt:Tol) at 170 \u00b0C, and comparison with literature data for other \n\naluminosilicate catalysts. \n\n Catalyst (Si/Al)\na\n time (h) CXyl (%) \n\nb\n YFur  (%) \n\nc\n Ref \n\nNa-MCM-22(24) 24 98 47 this work \n\nH-MCM-22(24) 16 92 70 this work \n\nNa-MCM-22(38) 24 87 58 this work \n\nH-MCM-22(38) 24/32 82/97 60/68 this work \n\nITQ-2(24) 6/16 60/99 66 this work \n\nH-ZSM-5(11.5) 6/16 88/98 60/61 this work \n\nAl-TUD-1(21) 6 91 60 Chapter 4 \n\nBEA(12) 4/6 98/100 54/49 Chapter 5 \n\nBEATUD-1(34) 6/8 94/98 69/74 Chapter 5 \n\nH-Nu-6(2) (32) 6 59 28 \n6\n \n\ndel-Nu-6(1) (29) 6 87 46 \n6\n \n\nH-Y Faujasite(15) 0.83 51 42 \n4\n \n\nH-Mordenite(11) 0.83 37 33 \n4 \n\na) The Si/Al atomic ratio of the catalyst is given in parenthesis. b) Conversion of D-xylose (CXyl) at a specified reaction times.                    \nc) 2-Furaldehyde yield (YFur) at specified reaction times.

In terms of the maximum yield of Fur reached, these results were superior \n\nto those reported previously for a delaminated solid acid (denoted del-Nu-6(1)) prepared by \n\nexfoliation of the lamellar precursor Nu-6(1) (46% YFur),\n6 comparable to a mesoporous Al-TUD-1 \n\nmaterial (60% YFur, Chapter 4), and lower than that for a BEATUD-1 composite (74% YFur, Chapter \n\n5), used as catalysts in the same reaction under similar conditions (ITQ-2(24) possessed \n\ncomparatively lower catalytic activity, Table 6.3). It is difficult to establish clear structure-activity \n\nrelationships between different types of aluminosilicate catalysts. The catalytic performances may \n\nbe due to an interplay of different factors such as morphology, crystalline structure, porosity, \n\nsurface polarity and acid properties. A common feature, however, was the apparent fairly high \n\nstability of the aluminosilicate catalysts investigated, under the applied reaction conditions \n\n(discussed in Section 6.2.2.4 for H-MCM-22 materials and ITQ-2(24)). It is worth mentioning that \n\n\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n289 \n\n \n\nthese comparisons merely summarise literature data obtained under similar reaction conditions, \n\nand do not serve to \u201crate\u201d the different families of catalysts (the physical-chemical properties of \n\ndifferent types of catalysts may be optimised).  \n\nA comparison of the catalytic results for ITQ-2(24) and H-MCM-22(24) showed no major \n\ndifferences in terms of reaction rate (Figure 6.16): ITQ-2(24) gave an initial reaction rate of          \n\n2.0 mmol.gcat\n-1.h-1 and a CXyl at 8 h of 78%, while H-MCM-22(24) gave 2.4 mmol.gcat\n\n-1.h-1 and a CXyl \n\nof 83%. The catalytic performances of ITQ-2(24) and H-MCM-22(24) were similar despite their \n\nconsiderably different SEXT (611 m\n2.g-1 for ITQ-2(24) and 52 m2.g-1 for H-MCM-22(24) (Figure 6.17 \n\nand Table 6.1). The catalytic results correlated fairly well with the similar total concentration of AS \n\n([L]+[B]) measured for the two catalysts using pyridine as probe molecule (Tables 6.2 and 6.3). The \n\ncatalytic activity did not correlate with the [B]col which was higher for ITQ-2(24) (153 \u00b5mol.g\n-1) \n\nthan for H-MCM-22(24) (45 \u00b5mol.g-1); possibly the stronger base collidine interacts with some AS \n\nwhich were too weak for catalysing the reaction of Xyl. The Fur yield versus Xyl conversion curves \n\nwere also comparable for the two catalysts, and the YFur reached at ca. 99% of CXyl was 71% for H-\n\nMCM-22(24) and 66% for ITQ-2(24) (Figure 6.17). Hence ITQ-2(24) standed on a similar footing to \n\nH-MCM-22(24) (the Si/Al ratio was the same for the two materials) in terms of catalytic \n\nperformance in the reaction of Xyl.  \n\nA clear assessment of the location (external/internal surfaces) of the effective AS was not \n\ntrivial. As mentioned in Section 6.1.1., the intrazeolite void space of the MWW pore structure is \n\naccessible through the 10-MR apertures,29 and the maximum pore diameter is 5.5 \u00c5 or 6.2 \u00c5 \n\nbased on atomic or Norman radii, respectively.27 It is reported that the Xyl molecules (in which the \n\nhemiacetal isomers are predominant in solution) possess an approximate molecular diameter of \n\n6.8 \u00c5,28 and the critical, maximum and kinetic diameters of Fur are reported to be 4.56 \u00c5, 5.99 \u00c5 \n\nand 5.5 \u00c5, respectively.27 Based on these data, and taking into consideration that in the liquid \n\nphase the solute molecules are solvated by the solvent, the access of Xyl (and possibly Fur) \n\nmolecules to the internal surface of the MWW-type framework may be severely hindered. It has \n\nbeen reported for benzene as substrate and zeolite MCM-22 as catalyst that the reaction takes \n\nplace essentially on the external surface.156,161 Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that \n\nbenzene (kinetic diameter of 5.85 \u00c5)162 presents low diffusivity in either of the two pore systems \n\nof the MWW-type structure.163 Assuming that the reaction of Xyl takes places essentially on the \n\nexternal surface of the catalysts, the similar catalytic performances of ITQ-2(24) and                      \n\nH-MCM-22(24) despite their considerably different SEXT, may be due to weaker overall acidity in \n\nthe former case (some AS may be inactive or possess relatively low intrinsic catalytic activity). \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n290 \n \n\nThe reaction of Xyl in the presence of ITQ-2(24) at 155 \u00b0C was slower (an initial reaction \n\nrate of 0.8 mmol.gcat\n-1.h-1) and led to a lower 55% YFur (at 98% CXyl, reached at 24 h of reaction) \n\nthan that observed at 170 \u00b0C (initial reaction rate of 2.0 mmol.gcat\n-1.h-1; 66% YFur at 99% CXyl, \n\nreached at 16 h reaction). For the reaction temperature of 170 \u00b0C, and at constant amount of the \n\ncatalyst (ITQ-2(24)) in the reaction medium, total volume of liquid phases and catalyst/Xyl mass \n\nratio, changing the 0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v) solvents ratio affects the yield of Fur: for a Wt:Tol of 1:1 \n\nv/v, 51% YFur was reached at 98% CXyl and 16 h of reaction, which is lower than that observed for a \n\nWt:Tol of 0.3:0.7 v/v, 66% YFur.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2.2.2. Catalytic performance of H-MCM-22 and ITQ-2(24) using solely \n\nwater as solvent \n\n \n\n \n\nThe reaction of Xyl was further investigated in the presence of ITQ-2(24) and                     \n\nH-MCM-22(24), using solely water as solvent (Wt), at 170 \u00b0C. The amount of the catalyst in the \n\nreaction medium, catalyst/ Xyl ratio, and the initial concentration of Xyl in water were the same \n\nfor the Wt:Tol biphasic system and solely water. The kinetic profiles for ITQ-2(24) and H-MCM-\n\n22(24) were very similar until 8 h of reaction (Figure 6.18), which correlated with the similar total \n\nconcentration of AS ([L]+[B]) for the two catalysts (Table 6.2). The yield of Fur versus Xyl \n\nconversion curves were comparable, giving 52-54% YFur at 97% CXyl (Figure 6.19). The comparable \n\nperformances for these two catalysts using the Wt system paralleled that observed for the \n\nbiphasic Wt:Tol system. For the two solvent systems, at reaction times longer than 8 h, ITQ-2(24) \n\ngave slightly higher conversions than H-MCM-22(24), possibly due to slower catalyst deactivation \n\n(coking) in the former case. The maximum yields for Fur reached at high conversions of Xyl were \n\nsomewhat lower when the simultaneous extraction of Fur was not performed, due to the \n\nenhanced formation of by-products (discussed in Section 6.2.2.3). \n\n \n\n\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n291 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.18- Kinetic profiles of the reaction of the conversion of D-xylose (CXyl) for H-MCM-\n\n22(24)(x), ITQ-2(24) (?) and H2SO4 (?), used as catalysts.

The initial amount of liquid acid was comparable to the total \n\namount of AS in the loaded solid acid catalysts. Although the kinetic profile until 8 h reaction was \n\nsimilar for H2SO4 and the solid acid catalysts, H2SO4 gave much lower conversions at longer \n\nreaction times (Figure 6.18). The pronounced retardation of the reaction of Xyl in the presence of \n\nH2SO4 may be due to the partial decomposition of the catalyst through its possible participation in \n\nthe formation of sulfur-containing by-products,164-166 and/or to the decrease in the concentration \n\nof active Br\u00f6nsted acid species due to the protonation of Fur.165,166 The yield of Fur versus the      \n\nXyl conversion profile for H2SO4 (55% YFur at 93% CXyl at 72 h) was comparable to those for the \n\nsolid acid catalysts (Figure 6.19). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2.2.3. Identification of the reaction products \n\n \n\n \n\nTo get insight into the type of by-products formed, the reaction of Xyl was carried out in \n\nthe presence of ITQ-2(24) using D2O as solvent at 170 \u00b0C for 24 h, and the reaction mixture was \n\nanalysed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, similar to that described in Chapter 5. The presence of \n\nXyl in the reaction solution was hardly detected in the spectra (Figure 6.20), which was consistent \n\nwith the catalytic results (97% CXyl at 24 h). The main peaks were relative to Fur: 9.4 (H-1\u00b4), 7.8   \n\n(H-4), 7.5 (H-2) and 6.6 ppm (H-3) in 1H NMR; 183.6 (C-1\u2019), 155 (C-4), 153.1 (C-1), 128.7 (C-2) and \n\n116.2 ppm (C-3) in 13C NMR (Figure 6.21). Formic acid was detected (169 ppm and 8.1 ppm in the \n\n13C and 1H NMR spectra, respectively), which may be formed via the decomposition of Fur.5,167-169 \n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum exhibited weak to very weak signals in the range of 3-4.5 pm which may be \n\ndue to carbohydrate H-C-O or H2C-O groups. The absence of \n1H NMR signals near 1.4 ppm and   \n\n4.3 ppm rules out the presence of significant amounts of lactic acid in the reaction solution of the \n\nreaction of Xyl with ITQ-2(24) as the catalyst, similar to that discussed in Chapter 5 for BEA tested \n\nas catalyst in the same reaction, under similar conditions. Weak peaks below 2 ppm may be \n\nassigned to methyl/methylene carbon atoms. Fragmentation reactions of Xyl can take place to \n\nform oxygenated aliphatic compounds.169,170   \n\n \n\n\n\nMCM-22 and ITQ-2 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n293 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.20-1H NMR spectrum of the solution obtained after separation of the solid phase from \n\nthe reaction mixture of D-xylose (Xyl) in the presence of ITQ-2(24) using D2O as solvent.

The washing of the used catalysts \n\nwith different solvents (methanol, acetone, toluene, water) failed to efficiently remove the \n\norganic matter from the catalysts. Therefore, prior to reuse, the solids were calcined at either  \n\n450 \u00b0C (ITQ-2(24)) or 550 \u00b0C (H-MCM-22(24)) for 5 h with a heating rate of 1 \u00b0C.min-1 to leave a \n\nresidual amount of organic matter of less than 1 wt.%.

YFur of up to 71% and 56% were \n\nreached at more than 96% of CXyl for the Wt:Tol and Wt systems, respectively for H-MCM-22(24). \n\nSulfuric acid as catalyst (4 mM; Wt reaction system) gave comparable YFur (55% at 93% CXyl) to H-\n\nMCM-22(24) in the Wt system (56% YFur at 91% CXyl). Decreasing the Si/Al ratio (in the range of 38-\n\n24) of H-MCM-22, increased the total amount of ([L]+[B]), which led to an improvement in the \n\ncatalytic activity, without affecting significantly the Fur selectivity. For the two Wt and Wt/Tol \n\nsolvent systems, the ITQ-2(24) catalyst exibited comparable catalytic performance to its H-MCM-\n\n22 counterpart (with the same Si/Al of 24), which correlated with the similar total amounts of \n\n[L]+[B] AS of these materials. No structural modifications or leaching phenomena were detected \n\nfor the used catalysts (thermally regenerated to remove organic deposits), and the yields of Fur in \n\nconsecutive batch runs are similar. A difference between H-MCM-22(24) and ITQ-2(24) was the \n\nless energy intensive conditions required for the thermal regeneration of ITQ-2(24) (450 \u00b0C \n\ncompared to 550 \u00b0C for H-MCM-22(24)), which might be related with some differences in the \n\nchemical nature of the carbonaceous matter, based on DSC analyses, and an apparently slower \n\ncatalyst deactivation by coking in the case of ITQ-2(24). Although the enhanced SEXT/SBET ratio was \n\neffectively accomplished for ITQ-2(24) through the delamination procedure, a concomitant \n\nweakening of the surface acidity seemed to have occurred, which should be avoided in order to \n\noptimise the catalytic performance and take the highest value/profit possible out of the \n\napplication of a more refined catalyst preparation procedure. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.4.

Introduction \n\n  \n\n \n\nThe complex mechanism for the dehydration of D-xylose involves a series of elementary \n\nsteps, and it may be accompanied by several types of undesirable side reactions                          \n\n(e.g. fragmentation of Xyl and reactions of Fur with other products or with itself).\n1-11\n\n The \n\nunderstanding of the influence of the acid and textural properties of porous solids on the catalytic \n\nreaction is not straightforward. Due to the complex reaction systems (many types of side \n\nreactions may occur, leading to complex mixtures of by-products), each elementary step may \n\ndepend differently on the catalytic properties of porous solids. The development of new solid acid \n\ncatalysts has been essential to replace homogeneous catalysts (disadvantages described in \n\nChapter 1), and other solid acids that present certain limitations. For example, the small pores     \n\n(&lt;2 nm) of zeolites make them difficult to use in reactions that involve the use of high molecular \n\nweight components.\n12\n\n Sulfated zirconia catalysts, known as super acids, become deactivated \n\nduring reactions (release of volatile sulfur containing pollutants).\n13,14\n\n Solid acids based on \n\nsupported metal oxides such as tungstated zirconia (ZrW) are potential candidates to replace \n\nmineral acids, or sulfated zirconia, which are harmful to the environment.\n15-17\n\n Although ZrW is \n\nmuch less active than sulfated zirconia, it offers a very important advantage as the WOx units in \n\nZrW are much more stable than sulfate groups in sulfated zirconia at high temperatures and in \n\nreductive atmospheres.\n18\n\n ZrW materials are almost 100% selective for branched alkanes and \n\nundergo only slow deactivation,\n19\n\n which is not irreversible when the catalyst is properly \n\nprepared.\n20\n\n ZrW was very active for isomerisation of C4 and C8 alkanes.\n21-23\n\n Recently, Weingarten \n\net al.,\n6\n in a comparative study using different types of solid acids as catalysts in the aqueous-phase \n\ndehydration of Xyl, reported that a commercial zirconium-tungsten mixed oxide catalyst (XZO \n\n1251, MEL Chemicals, WO3 content of 15 wt.%), with relatively high concentration of Lewis acid \n\nsites, was more active (and less selective to Fur) than an amorphous (mainly Br\u00f6nsted type) \n\nzirconium phosphate catalyst, and less active than Br\u00f6nsted microporous H-Y zeolite (Si/Al=30) in \n\nFur loss reactions (strong adsorption and subsequent decomposition of Fur on the catalyst\u2019s \n\nmicroporous surface).\n6\n A specific family of catalysts may be focused on to help establish structure-\n\nactivity relationships by modifying the physicochemical properties. ZrW catalysts have attracted \n\ninterest, presenting an advantage over heteropolytungstates in that they retain structural \n\nintegrity during high temperature oxidative treatments (> 600 \u00b0C), in contrast with \n\nheteropolytungstates that decompose to bulk WO3 at much lower temperatures (400 \u00b0C).\n24\n\n In this \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n310 \n \n\nsense, in this Chapter mixed zirconium tungsten oxides pre-prepared by co-condensation (ZrW(X), \n\nX=NO3, Cl; X is related to the type of zirconium precursor), or impregnation (with or without \n\naluminium) on mesophases of mesoporous zirconia (ZrW-MP, ZrWAl-MP), were investigated as \n\nsolid acid catalysts in the aqueous phase dehydration of Xyl into Fur, at 170 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.1.1. Mixed zirconium-tungsten materials, ZrW(X) (X=Cl, NO3) and ZrWAl \n\n \n\n \n\nZirconium-tungsten mixed oxides (ZrW) are fairly stable (thermally and chemically),\n21,22\n\n \n\nversatile solid acid catalysts and several types are commercially available. The tungsten atoms in \n\nthe surface  of zirconium-tungsten oxides may be octahedrally coordinated,\n25\n\n interconnected via \n\nW-O-W bridges,\n25,26\n\n or anchored to the support by W-O-Zr bonds.\n25\n\n Tungstated zirconias were \n\nfirst discovered in 1988 by Hino and Arata,\n21,27\n\n as strong solid acids, and demonstrated to be \n\nactive catalysts at low-temperature (30-50 \u00b0C). Since then, these types of materials have received \n\nmuch attention, due to the good combination of activity and selectivity in acid catalysed \n\nreactions,\n16,18,21,28-30\n\n and particular interest arose in the catalysis literature due to their industrial \n\napplication for converting C4-C8 paraffins to highly branched species that upgrade the gasoline \n\noctane number. \n21,22,29,31-39\n\n The good correlation between activity and selectivity can be explained \n\nas  a consequence of balanced surface acid properties, density of acid sites (AS),\n40-44\n\nand high \n\nthermal stability.\n16,18,20,22,24,25,30,39,42,43,45-49\n\n 12-Tungstophosphoric acid (H3PW12O40) and ZrW present \n\nthe strongest acid sites among tungsten oxide-based materials.\n24\n\n For ZrW materials, it is accepted \n\nthat the strong acidity is due to the strong interaction between zirconia and tungstate (WO3 \n\nspecies on ZrO2 support surfaces create strongly acidic sites\n18,21-23,25\n\n) or by the presence of ZrW \n\nclusters.\n17,18\n\n XRD patterns indicated that distorted octahedral W\n6+\n\n species dominate on the ZrO2 \n\nsurface,\n23,50\n\n and UV-vis spectra demonstrated that WO3 domain sizes increase with loading.\n23\n\n WO3 \n\nclusters formed on ZrW materials have the ability to delocalise negative charges (caused by the \n\nslight reduction of W\n6+\n\n centers) among several surface oxygen atoms, which allows hydrogen \n\natoms in OH surface groups and hydrocarbons to interact, retaining the cationic \n\ncharacter.\n16,24,25,30,42,43,45,46\n\n The temporary negative charge imbalance might lead to the formation \n\nof Br\u00f6nsted acid centers on the support (WO3)m, [W\n6-n\n\nO3] [n-H\n+\n] (Figure 7.1).\n\n24\n The formation of B \n\nacid sites by H2 requires L acid sites in the form of W\n6+\n\n centers within neutral WOx domains. These \n\nL acid sites can be titrated by H adatoms to produce active Br\u00f6nsted acid sites.43 Several authors \n\n\n\nZirconium tungstate \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n311 \n\n \n\nhad confirmed the presence of Lewis acid sites on these materials by infrared studies of adsorbed \n\nammonia and pyridine.\n18,51,52\n\n A balance between Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acidity may be required for a \n\nhigh activity. \n22,47,48\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1- Mechanism for the formation of Br\u00f6nsted acid site.\n43\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nZrW(X) materials are used in different types of catalytic reactions, including dehydrations, \n\nsuch as those of 2-butanol,\n42,53\n\n tert-butanol,\n54\n\n methanol ,\n30,53,55\n\n 1-propanol and 2-propanol,\n54\n\n        \n\n2-propenol,\n56\n\n and of glycerol to acrolein.\n57-65\n\n The acid-base behaviour of solids is a crucial \n\nparameter in a catalytic reaction.\n28\n\n Structure-activity relationships of ZrW-type materials have \n\nalso been applied in the study of different types of acid-catalysed reactions (the textural and acid \n\nproperties of ZrW(X) materials may be finely tuned through different synthetic \n\napproaches/conditions). The acidity of these types of oxides depends on various parameters after \n\nthe preparation procedures such as the nature of the precursors, precipitation procedures, \n\nconcentration of dopant, and calcination temperature.\n48,66,67\n\n Galano et al.\n28\n\n found that the Lewis \n\nacidity of the ZrW system decreases with the W loading which was consistent with their \n\ntheoretical calculations.\n28\n\n Not all the Br\u00f6nsted acid sites in the WO3 domain are equally acidic. The \n\nsites at the edge of the domain are the most acidic ones. In that study of Galano et al.\n28\n\n, the \n\nBr\u00f6nsted (B) acidity also decreased with the increase in the number of units in the polymeric \n\ndomains, as the B acid sites disappear due to the condensation phenomenon of superficial \n\ntungstate monomeric species.\n28\n\n Despite the extensive research on the active AS, the methods to \n\nimprove the activity of ZrW catalysts still need to be developed. One disadvantage is the low \n\nsurface area of ZrO2 (&lt;100 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n) in catalytic reactions, especially liquid phase reactions.  \n\nIn the case of the dehydration of Xyl into Fur, it may be advantageous to prepare \n\nmesoporous versions (denoted MP) of ZrW catalysts with enhanced amounts of effective AS and \n\nhigher surface area, similar to other procedures.\n17\n\n Catalyst preparation approaches in this \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n312 \n \n\ndirection can involve using a templating agent (for generating mesoporosity) and/or doping the \n\ncatalyst with aluminium (attempting to enhance acidity).\n68,69\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7.2.

Catalyst characterisation \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this Chapter ZrW(X) (X=Cl, NO3) materials were prepared by the co-precipitation \n\nmethod as reported in the literature (Chapter 2).\n70\n\n The mesoporous ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP \n\nmaterials were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation on a pre-prepared templated \n\nzirconium hydroxide support which was prepared by following the procedure described by Ciesla \n\net al.\n71\n\n (a surfactant-based synthesis). \n\nThe elemental composition and specific surface area (SBET) of the prepared catalysts are \n\ngiven in Table 7.1.  \n\nThe semi-quantitative analyses of the crystalline phases were performed using the \n\nReference Intensity Ratio (RIR) method applied to the XRD data of the prepared materials    \n\n(Figure 7.2). The RIR method is based upon scaling all diffraction data to the diffraction of \n\nstandard reference materials. The intensity of a diffraction peak is a combination of many factors, \n\nwhich by using the RIR method are scaled to a common reference and reduced to a constant, with \n\nthe exception of concentration of the analyte. The scale factor is determined by equation 7.1. \n\n \n\n                                        \n????????? (\n??????)\n\n?????????

The results for the \n\nessentially monoclinic ZrO2 were given for comparison. The spectra of the tungsten-containing \n\nmaterials showed similarities between each other and were very different from that of monoclinic \n\nZrO2, partly due to the predominant t-ZrO2 phase in the former materials.\n30\n\n The characteristic \n\nband of t-ZrO2 at ca. 625-640 cm\n-1\n\n was present, which is in accord with the literature.\n18,76,77,92\n\n  \n\nBands characteristic of crystalline WO3 (typically at ca. 800-810 cm\n-1\n\n, 710-720 cm\n-1\n\n and   \n\nca. 270 cm\n-1\n\n) were hardly detected (consistent with the XRD data),\n25,31\n\n suggesting that crystalline \n\nWO3 was not formed on the surface of W-ZrO2.\n73\n\n This is in accord with the literature for ZrW type \n\nmaterials.\n73,74,76,77,88,89,96\n\n However, in exceptional cases these typical WO3 bands were observed for \n\nZrW type materials.\n31,80\n\n Broad bands in the region 930-1020 cm\n-1\n\n may be assigned to the terminal \n\nW=O bonds which may be isolated or polymeric mono oxo tungsten species.\n30,49,73,77,89,92,96,97\n\n \n\nGeometrically different WOx species on the surface may be present when the bands in the region \n\n930-1020 cm\n-1\n\n present shoulder peaks.\n25\n\n These may be octahedrally and tetrahedrally \n\ncoordinated WOx species. According to a few authors, the band at ca. 930 cm\n-1\n\n was attributed to a \n\nsymmetric vibration mode of (WO4)\n2-\n\n anions in tetrahedral symmetry.\n76,78,80,98,99\n\n These anions are \n\nthought to form an amorphous phase after exchange with the hydroxyl groups of the zirconium \n\nprecursor, in which Zr\n4+\n\ncations become surrounded by WO4\n2-\n\n,\n76\n\n allowing the crystallisation of \n\nzirconia in the tetragonal phase during calcination.\n25,76\n\n  Another possibility to obtain WO4\n2-\n\n in \n\ntetrahedral symmetry occurs when the interaction of W surface species with the support is weak \n\nand these species are surrounded by protons.\n76\n\n \n\n\n\nZirconium tungstate \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n319 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.5- Raman spectra of unused and recycled catalysts. \n\n \n\n \n\nRaman bands assigned to ?(W=O) depend on the base strength of the ligands to which the \n\nW atom is coordinated and therefore might suffer slight shifts. The stronger the basicity of the \n\noxide ligands is, the weaker is the W=O bond and the lower is the frequency of ?(W=O).100 The \n\npresence of water can also lead to a shift of the band of the W=O groups to lower frequencies, \n\ndue to the strong interaction with water by hydrogen bonding; the band of W-O-Zr stretching \n\ncannot be unequivocally assigned due to the overlap with other broad signals.\n89\n\n The W-O-W \n\ncharacteristic band remains unchanged in the presence of water.\n89\n\n Additionally, the bands at    \n\n840 cm\n-1\n\n, 900-910 cm\n-1\n\n and 820-830 cm\n-1\n\n can also be present and they were attributed to the \n\nantisymmetric stretching vibration of tetrahedral W\n6+\n\n,\n78\n\n W-O-Zr stretching vibration of WOx \n\nspecies anchored to the support,\n78,89,97,101\n\nand W-O-W, respectively.\n76,78,88,89,97,101\n\n A low intensity \n\nband at ca. 800-820 cm\n-1 \n\nwas observed in the case of ZrW(X) and ZrW-MP materials which may be \n\nattributed to W-O-W vibrations. The presence of W-O-W stretching modes is indicative that the \n\nWOx surface structure consists of poorly defined oligomeric or polymeric species that are \n\ninfluenced by their interaction with the ZrO2 surface, and most likely cover the support \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n320 \n \n\nsurface.\n89,101\n\n Sunita et al.\n74\n\n had also observed a band at ca. 825 cm\n-1\n\n but the authors here had \n\nattributed this absorption to W-O-Zr vibrations instead of W-O-W.\n74\n\n \n\nAll the prepared materials possessed both B and L interacting with pyridine after \n\noutgassing at 150 \u00b0C.  The concentrations of B and L were determined as explained previously in \n\nSection 3.2.1.2 of Chapter 3. In this sense, the [B] (band at ca. 1545 cm\n-1\n\n) and [L] (band at ca.  \n\n1450 cm\n-1\n\n) for ZrW(X) materials were determined through equations 3.1 and 3.2 as specified in \n\nChapter 3 (Figure 7.6). Besides the characteristic bands at 1545 cm\n-1\n\n and at 1450 cm\n-1\n\n, bands at \n\n1490 cm\n-1\n\n (sum of L and B), 1620 cm\n-1\n\n (due to L) and 1640 cm\n-1\n\n (due to B) were also observed, \n\nsimilar to that observed for H-MCM-22(24) and ITQ-2(24) in Chapter 6. FT-IR spectra of all \n\nprepared catalysts exhibited similar bands (Figure 7.6), and the ratio [L]/[B] varied in the range \n\n1.2-1.4 (Table 7.2).

The total amount of [B]+[L] was \n\nconsiderably greater for ZrW-MP than for the ZrW(X) materials which may be partly related to the \n\nhigher SBET in the former case, enhancing the accessibility of the AS to the base probe (the W/Zr \n\nmolar ratios were similar for the three materials). The ZrW-MP possessed similar acid strengths to \n\nthe ZrW(X) materials. In comparison to ZrW-MP, the ZrWAl-MP material possessed somewhat \n\nhigher [B]+[L] (and SBET), and slightly stronger Br\u00f6nsted acidity.

Catalytic performance of ZrW(X), ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP materials \n\n \n\n \n\nThe mesoporous ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP catalysts led to higher yields of Fur at \n\ncomparable reaction times, in comparison to the ZrW(X) catalysts (Figure 7.8), which correlated \n\nwith the higher total amounts of AS of the former two catalysts (Table 7.2). In comparison to  \n\nZrW-MP, the ZrWAl-MP catalyst led to higher yields of Fur at high conversions of Xyl (52% YFur at \n\n98% CXyl for ZrWAl-MP compared to 41% YFur at 100% CXyl for ZrW-MP, Figure 7.9), suggesting that \n\nthe combined effects of enhanced SBET and surface acidity favoured the dehydration of Xyl into \n\nFur. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 7.8- Yield of 2-furaldehyde (YFur) versus reaction time for the catalysts ZrW(Cl) (?), \n\nZrW(NO3) (?), ZrW-MP (?), and ZrWAl-MP ((+) for 0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v) biphasic solvent system \n\nand (X) for solely Wt (1 cm\n3\n).

The yield of Fur at similar Xyl conversions was lower for the water system \n\nthan for the biphasic solvent system (Figure 7.9). The water and biphasic solvent systems led to \n\ncomparable yields of Fur until ca. 90% CXyl (46-48% YFur). Afterwards the YFur dropped to 36% when \n\nCXyl reached 100% in the case of the water system, whereas in the case of the biphasic solvent \n\nsystem, the YFur increased to 52% at 98% CXyl (Figure 7.9). In a previous study for the dehydration \n\nof Xyl in the presence of tungstated zirconia (ZrW, XZO 1251 with WO3 content 15 wt.%, supplied \n\nby MEL Chemicals) using solely water it was reported that 16% YFur was reached at 96% CXyl, 160 \u00b0C \n\n(0.33 M Xyl; 7.5 gcat.dm\n-3\n\n).\n6\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n324 \n \n\n7.2.2.2. Identification of the reaction products \n\n \n\n \n\nThe identification of by-products may help to identify factors influencing the side \n\nreactions, important for tailoring the properties of solid acid catalysts for the target reaction.  \n\nThe InsolOrg products identification (also known as humins) is not trivial, as discussed in \n\nChapter 5 for the reaction of Xyl in the presence of micro/mesoporous composite BEATUD-1 and \n\nin Chapter 6 for ITQ-2(24) under similar conditions to those used in the present work. The FT-IR \n\nand \n13\n\nC MAS NMR spectra were quite complex and it was only possible to identify clearly Xyl, Fur \n\nand formic acid (the organic matter possessed aldehyde/ketose groups, fragments related to Xyl \n\nand (un)saturated carbon-carbon bonds) as shown in Chapters 5 and 6. \n\nWith respect to the water soluble by-products, only formic acid was detected by HPLC \n\n(using a UV diode array detector), which according to the literature, may be formed via \n\nfragmentation of sugars under acidic hydrothermal conditions,\n103,104\n\n or hydrolytic fission of the \n\naldehyde group of Fur.\n7-9,105\n\n However, the yellow colour of the liquid phases of the reaction \n\nmixtures indicated the presence of other types of by-products besides formic acid. Therefore, a \n\nmore detalied study to identify water soluble by-products of the reaction of Xyl in the presence of \n\nZrWAl-MP, using water as solvent, at 170 \u00b0C, was carried out by employing solid-phase \n\nmicroextraction (SPME) coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography \n\n(GCxGC) with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToFMS). The SPME/GCxGC-ToFMS technique \n\nallowed the separation and identification of water soluble reaction products which were \n\nsufficiently volatile under the applied analytical conditions (details given in the experimental part, \n\nSection 2.4 of Chapter 2). For comparison, the analysis was performed for the reaction of Fur in \n\nthe presence of ZrWAl-MP, at 170 \u00b0C.  \n\nThe identified reaction by-products are listed in Table 7.3 (many more products were \n\ndetected, which were not clearly identified).

The first four \n\nof these are possible sugar fragmentation products,\n103\n\n and were not detected with Fur as the \n\nsubstrate.  \n\n2,3-Pentadione and hexadione products were formed in the reaction of Xyl and not of Fur. \n\nAccording to the literature 2,3-pentadione may be formed through a series of reactions involving \n\naldol reactions of butanedione (detected in this work) with formadehyde or of acetaldehyde \n\n(detected in this work) with 1-hydroxy-2-propanone.\n140\n\n The mechanism of formation of the \n\nhexadiones is not clear. It has been reported that 2,5-hexadione is a possible product of the \n\nreaction of 2,5-dimethylfuran (not detected in this work) with water.\n141\n\n It is worth mentioning \n\nthat the by-products may react with Xyl (e.g. Xyl bound to a non-carbohydrate moiety) and/or \n\nFur, and fragmentation and recombination of carbohydrate fragments may take place, further \n\nenhancing the complexity of the overall reaction mechanism.  \n\nFuranone products were detected, namely 3-methyl-2(5H)-furanone and 5-methyl-2(5H)-\n\nfuranone, for Xyl and not for Fur as substrate. A similar compound identified as 5-methyl-3(2H)-\n\nfuranone was previously reported as the product of the reaction of 2-deoxy- D-erythro-pentose in \n\naqueous acidic medium.\n142\n\n \n\nSeveral compounds possessing one furan ring were detected and some (noted with the \n\nsymbol * in Table 7.3, e.g. methyl-furan-2-carboxylate) were common to the reactions of Xyl and \n\nFur. Furan derivatives possessing two furan rings were formed (e.g. di-2-furanyl-ethanedione), \n\nand related by-products have been reported previously for the reactions of pentoses \n143,144\n\n and \n\nhexoses.\n132\n\n 2,5-Dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone was detected for the reaction of Xyl and not of Fur, as \n\nwell as a variety of aromatic by-products possessing a benzene ring, suggesting that the formation \n\nof these by-products involved intermediates of the reaction of Xyl. Monocyclic compounds \n\nincluded hydroxyacetophenones and hydroxybenzaldehydes, and bicyclic compounds were \n\nbenzopyrone and benzofuran derivatives. It is worth mentioning that phenolic compounds can be \n\nreadily transformed into coloured products (as mentioned above the reaction solutions were \n\nyellow). Aromatic compounds of the type benzopyrone and acetophenone possessing hydroxyl \n\nfunctional groups have been identified as by-products of the reaction of Xyl under acidic \n\nconditions.\n145,146\n\n \n\nThe reaction of Fur (as the substrate) in the absence or presence of ZrWAl-MP, at 170 \u00b0C \n\n(water system), gave 16% and 24% CXyl at 4 h reaction, respectively. In the case of the biphasic \n\n\n\nZirconium tungstate \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n331 \n\n \n\nsolvent system no measurable conversion of Fur was observed, which was consistent with the \n\nfavourable effects of the biphasic solvent system in avoiding Fur loss reactions. \n\n \n\n \n\n7.2.2.3. Catalyst stability \n\n  \n\n \n\nDSC analyses (exemplified for ZrWAl-MP in Figure 7.13) of the used catalysts exhibited \n\ntwo exothermic bands in the temperature range 200-550 \u00b0C which did not appear for the \n\nrespective unused catalysts and were therefore attributed to the decomposition of InsolOrg.  \n\nThe amount of water-insoluble organic matter (designated as InsolOrg) was determined \n\nby TGA of the washed/dried solids (after reaching a CXyl of 98-100%), based on the mass loss in the \n\ntemperature range 200-600 \u00b0C, and expressed as  \n!??? \"? ???\"?%?$\n\n??????? !??? \"? ???\n (mg.gXyl\n\n-1\n) (Figure 7.13). \n\nThe amount of InsolOrg was similar for ZrWAl-MP (154 mg.gXyl\n-1\n\n) and ZrW-MP                \n\n(133 mg.gXyl\n-1\n\n). A greater amount of InsolOrg was formed for the water system (197 mg.gXyl\n-1\n\n) in \n\ncomparison to the biphasic solvent system (154 mg.gXyl\n-1\n\n, Figure 7.13).  These results are in \n\nagreement with the partition ratio of Fur (PRFur) that was calculated as specified in equation 5.2 in \n\nChapter 5 and measured at a.t., and gave a variation in the range 7\u00b10.7 throughout the reaction. \n\nHence, as Fur is formed it is dissolved favourably in the organic phase, which does not dissolve Xyl \n\n(or similarly polar intermediates). Therefore the higher yield of Fur and lower amount of InsolOrg \n\nformed at high conversions in the case of the biphasic solvent system may be partly due to: \n\ni) reduction in the concentration of Fur in the aqueous phase and consequently the lower \n\nextension of Fur loss reactions involving Xyl and/or polar intermediates,\n1,7-9,11\n\n  \n\nii) competitive adsorption effects minimising consecutive reactions of Fur (mainly Tol \n\nsolvated) on the catalyst surface (polar, hydrophilic).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n332 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 7.13- TGA (represented as (mass of InsolOrg)/(initial mass of D-Xylose) and DSC curves for \n\nthe ZrWAl-MP catalyst separated (washed/dried) from the reaction mixture after reaching at least \n\n98% of D-xylose conversion (CXyl), using the 0.3 Wt:0.7 Tol (v/v)  biphasic solvent system (red lines) \n\nor solely Wt (1 cm\n3\n) (green lines).

For each catalyst, the yields of \n\nFur in recycling runs were comparable (Figure 7.14). It is worth mentioning that for the \n\nwashed/dried ZrW-MP catalyst which was not subjected to the thermal treatment, the yield of        \n\nFur dropped considerably from 41% for the first batch run to 13% for the second one, possibly \n\ndue to the catalyst surface passivation by adsorbed organic compounds. \n\n \n\n\n\nZirconium tungstate \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n333 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.14- Yield of 2-furaldehyde (YFur) in recycling runs of the reaction of D-xylose (Xyl) in the \n\npresence of ZrWAl-MP or ZrW-MP.

The Raman spectra for \n\nthe used/regenerated catalysts exhibited higher background noise. \n\nThe stability of the mesoporous structure was confirmed by the similar textural properties \n\n(type IV isotherms, SBET and pore size distribution) of the used/regenerated ZrW-MP                 \n\n(109-133 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n; pore size distribution between ca. 2 and 7 nm width) and ZrWAl-MP (133-143 \n\nm\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n; pore size distribution between ca. 2.5 and 6 nm width) catalysts (Figure 7.4). \n\nICP-AES analyses of the aqueous phase of the reaction mixtures indicated no measurable \n\nleaching of Zr, W or Al. Based on these results it seems that ZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP were fairly \n\nstable catalysts. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n334 \n \n\n7.3. Conclusions \n\n \n\n \n\nZirconium-tungsten mixed oxides were relatively active catalysts in the aqueous phase \n\nreaction of Xyl, at 170 \u00b0C. The catalysts prepared by co-condensation (ZrW(X)) led to more than \n\n90% CXyl within 2 h of reaction, but YFur were less than 35%. The yield of Fur at a similar conversion \n\nof Xyl could be improved by using a templating agent to give ZrW-MP with enhanced specific \n\nsurface area and amount of accessible AS (41% YFur at 100% CXyl), and furthermore by doping the \n\ninorganic material with aluminium to give ZrWAl-MP (51% YFur at 98% CXyl).  \n\nSPME/GCxGC-ToFMS analyses were carried out for the reaction of Xyl, showing that a \n\ncomplex mixture of water soluble by-products was obtained. Detailed systematic studies using \n\nthis technique may give valuable insights into the overall reaction mechanisms of the conversion \n\nof carbohydrate biomass, important for identifying factors (catalyst properties, reaction \n\nconditions) affecting product selectivities. \n\nCatalyst recycling tests and characterisation of the recovered solids revealed that        \n\nZrW-MP and ZrWAl-MP were fairly stable catalysts under the applied reaction conditions. For the \n\nZrWAl-MP catalyst, the yields of Fur were higher when using the biphasic Wt:Tol solvent system \n\ninstead of solely water as the solvent (40% at 93% CXyl). On the other hand, the yields of Fur \n\nreached for ZrWAl-MP using solely water as the solvent (cheaper, cleaner), were higher than \n\nthose for the ZrW(X) catalysts coupled with the biphasic solvent system. \n\n By fine-tuning the catalytic properties of these types of solid acid catalysts it may be \n\npossible to further improve their catalytic performances. Furthermore, tungsten/aluminium \n\nmodified zirconias may be promising (versatile) catalysts for converting cellulose/glucose (most \n\nabundant terrestrial poly/monosaccharides) to added value products such as Hmf. The product \n\ndistribution obtained in the aqueous reaction of Glu in the presence of aluminium-zirconium \n\nmixed oxides at 180 \u00b0C was found to be dependent on the acid-base properties of the catalysts. \n68\n\n  \n\nZrO2 is effective in the isomerisation of Glu using water as solvent, at 200 \u00b0C.\n148\n\n  McNeff  \n\net al.\n147\n\n demonstrated the feasibility of using a continuous process coupled with stable porous \n\nheterogeneous metal oxide catalysts (zirconia, titania) for the conversion of cellulose to Hmf in \n\nfairly good yields.\n147\n\n More recently, Chambon et al.\n59\n\n reported that tungstated zirconia and \n\ntungstated alumina exhibited remarkable catalytic activity and stability in the depolymerisation of \n\ncellulose. A major limitation of the aqueous phase conversion of cellulose is the reduced solubility \n\n\n\nZirconium tungstate \n\n________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n335 \n\n \n\nof the polysaccharide in water.

Introduction \n\n  \n\n \n\nIonic liquids (ILs) have been tested as solvents and/or catalysts, due to the interesting \n\nproperties they display when compared to common organic solvents used in carbohydrate \n\nchemistry.\n1\n ILs have several advantages as mentioned in Chapter 1, fulfilling some of the green \n\nchemistry requirements, like having almost no vapour pressure (avoiding atmospheric pollution \n\nproblems typically associated with volatile organic solvents and product contamination with \n\nsolvents in distillation processes), and some can be quite stable at high temperatures. \n\nFurthermore, IL solvents open up a window of opportunities for the dissolution of carbohydrates.\n1\n \n\nFor example, cellulose, which is one of the most abundant natural polymers and attractive \n\nrenewable feedstock, is pratically insoluble in water and most organic solvents. In an early study, \n\nSwatloski et al.\n2\n reported that cellulose could be dissolved in ILs. Cellulose dissolves in [Bmim]Cl \n\nunder conventional (100 \u00b0C) or microwave-assisted heating.\n2\n When cellulose is dissolved in an IL \n\nthe ?-glycosidic bonds are more susceptible to acid-catalysed hydrolysis at relatively low \n\ntemperatures (100 \u00b0C) and low catalyst loading.\n1,3-5\n\n Different studies have demonstrated the \n\npotential of hydrophilic ionic liquids (ILs) for the conversion of saccharides to Fur and Hmf. The \n\nstate of the art of IL based catalytic systems used in the conversion of carbohydrates to furanic \n\naldehydes under mild reaction conditions, is described in detail in Chapter 1. Most of the \n\npublished work on the use of ILs for the conversion of saccharides has focused on the hexose \n\nmonosaccharides D-fructose (Fru) and D-glucose (Glu). The published work with ILs using D-xylose \n\nto obtain Fur has been less studied.   \n\nLansalot-Matras et al.\n6\n firstly reported on the dehydration of D-fructose in the presence of \n\nAmberlyst-15 or p-TsOH as catalysts, using solvent mixtures of DMSO (the latter enhanced \n\ndissolution of D-fructose in the IL medium) and [Bmim]BF4 or [Bmim]PF6, which gave 75-80% YHmf \n\nwithin 24 h, at 80 \u00b0C. In another study, the dehydration of fructose in 1-H-3-methyl imidazolium \n\nchloride, [Hmim]Cl gave 92% YHmf within 15-45 min at 90 \u00b0C.\n7\n The acidic IL 3-allyl-1-(4-\n\nsulforylchloride butyl) imidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate was also effective in converting Fru \n\nto Hmf, using DMSO as solvent, at 100 \u00b0C, under microwave radiation: ca. 85% YHmf was reached \n\nwithin 4 min.\n8\n Immobilisation of this IL in silica gel gave an effective and reusable solid catalyst, \n\nwith no decay in Hmf yields after seven runs.\n8\n Zhang et al.,\n\n9\n reported on the use of several metal \n\nchlorides in 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Amim]Cl, A=alkyl) ILs for dehydration of Glu, a \n\nmore demanding saccharide than Fru for Hmf production at 100 \u00b0C. These authors found that \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n346 \n\n \n\nCrCl2 in [Emim]Cl (E=ethyl) was a singularly effective catalytic system, affording up to 70% YHmf at \n\nca. 95% CGlu (3 h reaction), and negligible amounts of levulinic acid were formed. Several \n\nexplanations of the high Hmf yield achieved in imidazolium chloride ILs have been put forward, \n\nsuch as the low concentration of water present in the reaction medium (avoiding the subsequent \n\nhydration of Hmf to levulinic acid), the formation of complexes between the IL and the sugar \n\n(decreasing the activation barrier for Hmf formation),\n7\n and the formation of complexes between \n\nthe sugar and the metal chlorides in the ILs.\n9\n  \n\nThis Chapter focuses on the dehydration of pentose (D-xylose) and hexose (D-fructose \n\nand D-glucose) monosaccharides, and the one-pot hydrolysis of di/polysaccharides and \n\nsubsequent dehydration of the corresponding monosaccharides into Fur or Hmf, using the acidic \n\nIL 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium hydrogen sulfate supplied by Merck KGaA ([Emim]HSO4) (Figure \n\n8.1), at 100 \u00b0C. A comparative study with 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl) \n\n(Figure 8.1) or ([Emim]HSO4/[Bmim]Cl) mixtures was also carried out and the effect of adding \n\nchromium chloride was investigated, with the aim of enhancing the selectivity of the dehydration \n\nof Glu to Hmf. \n\n \n\n                   \n\nNN\nH3CH2C\n\nHSO4\n\n                   \n\nNN\nH3CH2CH2CH2C\n\nCl\n\n \n\nFigure 8.1- Molecular structures of [Emim]HSO4 and [Bmim]Cl. \n\n \n\n \n\nMore recent studies have been reported for the conversion of Xyl and related \n\npolysaccharides to Fur using IL-based catalytic systems. Sievers et al.\n10\n\n reported 14% YHmf using \n\n[Bmim]Cl and H2SO4 as catalyst at 120 \u00b0C/94 min. Binder et al.\n11\n\n improved the YFur to 45% using \n\nDMA/CrCl2 coupled to [Emim]Cl at 100 \u00b0C/2 h. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.2. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n8.2.1.

These results were fairly good, for example, in comparison to that reported for \n\nthe reaction of Xyl carried out in the presence of Keggin-type heteropolytungstate (ca. 0.07 M) or \n\nsulfuric acid (0.01 M), using DMSO as solvent (a commonly used solvent to promote selectivity to \n\nthe furan derivative).\n12\n\n After 4 h at 140 \u00b0C, these reaction systems gave 58-63% YFur.\n13\n\n  \n\nWhen toluene (Tol) was used as a co-solvent with [Emim]HSO4, a liquid-liquid biphasic \n\nsolvent system was obtained, which gave approximately half of the YFur (33%) achieved without a \n\nco-solvent (62% YFur), at 30 min. However, the YFur for the biphasic solvent system reached 84% at \n\n6 h (Figure 8.4, Table 8.1), which was higher than the maximum observed without a co-solvent \n\n(62% YFur at 30 min). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.4- Conversion of D-Xylose (CXyl) (O) and yield of 2-furaldehyde (YFur) (+) versus time for the \n\nreaction carried out in [Emim]HSO4/Tol.

These results paralleled those reported \n\nin the literature,\n14,15\n\n for reactions of saccharides in aqueous phase, concerning the beneficial \n\neffect of using a co-solvent for improving Fur and Hmf yields. \n\nIncreasing the Xyl concentration from 0.22 to 0.67 M (or 33 to 100 g.dm\n-3\n\n of IL) led to an \n\nincrease in CXyl at 4 h reaction from 71 to 95% and in YFur from 71 to 82%, under biphasic \n\nconditions (Table 8.1). A further increase in the amount of Xyl to 1.11 M (167 g.dm\n-3\n\n IL) resulted in \n\na decrease in the Fur yield at high conversions (60% at 93% CXyl, compared with 82% at 95% CXyl for \n\n0.67 M Xyl). Increasing the reaction temperature from 100 \u00b0C to 120 \u00b0C (for 0.67 M Xyl) in \n\n[Emim]HSO4/Tol accelerated the reaction, giving 100% CXyl within 30 min, and a YFur of 58% (Table \n\n8.1). At higher reaction temperatures, the reaction was probably so fast that the effect of the        \n\nco-solvent on product selectivity became less pronouced. As the reaction proceeded the mixture \n\nbecame darker and increasingly viscous, and thus mass transfer limitations were expected to be \n\nimportant and may affect the overall reaction. Several side reactions may contribute to the loss of \n\nFur, such as condensation reactions between Fur and intermediates of the conversion of Xyl to \n\nFur.\n16\n\n The identification of reaction products is addressed in Section 8.2.2.5. More recently, Tao et \n\nal.\n17\n\n reported for the acidic IL [Sbmim]HSO4 (50 wt.% based on the amount of the solvent mixture) \n\nin a solvent mixture of H2O/IBMK used in the reaction of Xyl (0.70 M) that 91 wt.% YFur was \n\nreached at 95% CXyl at 150 \u00b0C/25 min using conventional heating.\n17\n\n The IL [Bmim]HPO4 was also \n\ntested but was less effective than [Sbmim]HSO4 under similar conditions (68 wt.% YFur at 80% \n\nCXyl).\n17\n\n \n\nFor comparative purposes the reaction of Xyl was carried out in [Bmim]Cl, using Tol as   \n\nco-solvent at 100 \u00b0C, with or without H2SO4. No reaction took place in [Bmim]Cl/Tol without \n\nH2SO4, at least until 4 h (Table 8.1). These results showed that the Br\u00f6nsted acidity associated \n\nwith the anion in [Emim]HSO4 was responsible for Xyl dehydration to Fur. The reaction of Xyl in \n\naqueous H2SO4 (0.4 M, approximately equivalent to half of the number of moles of charged \n\n[Emim]HSO4) gave less than 5% YFur at 38% CXyl, after 4 h at 100 \u00b0C. When H2SO4 (0.04 M) was \n\nadded to the [Bmim]Cl/Tol mixture, 83% CXyl and 44% YFur were reached at 4 h. For the same \n\nresidence time, [Emim]HSO4/Tol gave 82% YFur (Figure 8.4). Fur selectivity increased with time \n\npossibly due to the fact that the reaction mechanism involves a series of elementary steps.\n13\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Acidic ionic liquid, [Emim]HSO4  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n351 \n\n \n\n8.2.2.2.

In this \n\nwork, a simple reaction-vacuum evaporation setup was used for performing the reaction of Xyl in \n\n[Emim]HSO4 without a co-solvent at 100 \u00b0C. A control experiment carried out at 100 \u00b0C using the \n\nIL without Xyl showed that only residual water was distilled out of the IL as demonstrated in the \n\nFT-IR spectra (Figure 8.5). Since the FT-IR spectra of the IL before and after the control experiment \n\nwere similar, and no colour changes were observed, the IL was stable under the applied reaction \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.5- FT-IR spectra of [Emim]HSO4 as acquired (blue line), [Emim]HSO4 after the control \n\nexperiment (vacuum drying, pink line) and the distillate obtained in that experiment (red line). \n\n \n\n \n\nAfter 4 h of reaction of Xyl in [Emim]HSO4 under reduced pressure, 84% CXyl and 15% SFur   \n\nwere obtained, which compared unfavourably to the results obtained under nitrogen \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n352 \n\n \n\natmosphere, in which the SFur was 72% at a similar conversion of Xyl (86% CXyl) in only 30 min. \n\nSimilar to that observed with the reaction mixture in the presence of Tol, the initially transparent \n\nmixture of the IL and Xyl became gradually darker and more viscous with increasing residence \n\ntime, suggesting the formation of heavy products.  \n\n \n\n \n\n8.2.2.3. Reaction of hexoses using [Emim]HSO4/co-solvent systems under \n\nN2 atmosphere \n\n \n\n \n\nThe efficiency of the [Emim]HSO4/Tol system was further investigated for the reaction of \n\nthe hexoses, Glu and Fru, using an initial concentration similar to that used for Xyl (0.67 M, or    \n\n120 g.dm\n-3\n\n IL). The reactivity of the monosaccharides (based on conversion at 30 min, Table 8.1) \n\nfollowed the order: Fru (100%) > Glu (95%) > Xyl (80%). As mentioned above, the yield of                  \n\nFur from the reaction of Xyl increased up to 84% reached at 6 h (Figure 8.2). The reaction of Fru \n\ngave 79% YHmf within 30 min. When [Bmim]Cl/Tol was used instead of [Emim]HSO4/Tol, the \n\nreaction of Fru gave 16% YHmf at 30 min, under similar conditions. Hence, the Br\u00f6nsted acidity \n\nassociated with [Emim]HSO4 played a major role in the dehydration of Fru, similar to that \n\nobserved for Xyl as substrate. For [Bmim]HSO4, Hu et al.\n21\n\n reported 56% YHmf without a co-solvent, \n\nat 80 \u00b0C and 1 h, and very recently, Shi et al.\n22\n\n reported 70% YHmf, at 120 \u00b0C and 1 h. Another types \n\nof acidic ILs with hydrogen sulfate (HSO4\n-\n) have been tested and gave lower Hmf yield, such as \n\n[Hmim]HSO4 (24% YHmf with DMSO as co-solvent at 90 \u00b0C/2 h, 0.46 M Fru),\n23\n\n or [NMM]HSO4 (23% \n\nYHmf with DMF-LiBr as co-solvent at 90 \u00b0C/2 h, 0.56 M Fru).\n24\n\n \n\nWhile Hmf may be formed in significant amounts from the reaction of Fru in [Emim]Cl at \n\n100-120 \u00b0C, previous studies have shown that the same does not apply for the reaction of Glu in \n\nthis IL, under similar reaction conditions.\n9\n These results were reproduced in this work for \n\n[Emim]HSO4 at 100 \u00b0C (Table 8.1).   \n\nFor the Glu/[Emim]HSO4/Tol system, the Hmf selectivity was very low (<9% up to 100% \n\nCGlu, reached within 6 h). In a later study, Tong et al.\n23\n\n reported a similar behaviour for Glu  (0.46 \n\nM) dehydration (2% YHmf at 90 \u00b0C and 2 h using DMSO as co-solvent and [NMP]HSO4 as solvent). \n\nThe decrease in the reaction temperature from 100 to 80 \u00b0C led to lower CGlu at 30 min (86% \n\ncompared with 85% at 100 \u00b0C, Table 8.1), and the Hmf yield was less than 8% up to 97% CGlu \n\n(reached within 24 h).

It has been postulated that the efficient in situ isomerisation of Glu to Fru is \n\nimportant to obtain high Hmf yield.\n9,26-29\n\n In the case of the Glu/[Emim]HSO4/Tol system, no Fru \n\nwas detected by HPLC, suggesting that Glu to Fru isomerisation hardly took place, which may \n\nexplain the much lower Hmf selectivities from Glu than from Fru (notwithstanding the similar \n\nreactivity of both hexoses).  \n\nZhang et al.\n9\n obtained outstanding results for the conversion of Glu into Hmf (nearly    \n\n70% YHmf after 3 h at 100 \u00b0C) by adding CrCl2 (0.04 M) to [Emim]Cl without a co-solvent. A series of \n\nother metal halides was tested, but the results were much poorer. As mentioned in Chapter 1, the \n\nauthors proposed that a chromium chloride anion facilitates mutarotation of Glu (from                 \n\n?-glucopyranose to ?-glucopyranose anomer) in the IL, followed by isomerisation into a \n\nfructofuranose intermediate via a chromium enolate intermediate.\n8\n For comparative purposes, \n\nthe reaction of Glu was carried out in [Bmim]Cl/Tol/CrCl3 at 100 \u00b0C. CrCl3 was chosen instead of \n\nCrCl2 since it is more stable and easily handled under air (less toxic), much cheaper, and, on the \n\nother hand, it is very likely that Cr\n2+\n\n is oxidised to Cr\n3+\n\n in the IL system containing dissolved air and \n\nwater (at least from the dehydration reaction). After 4 h at 100 \u00b0C, the Glu/[Bmim]Cl/CrCl3 \n\nreaction system (without co-solvent) led to 81% YHmf, which was much higher than that reported \n\nby Zhao et al.\n9\n for the system Glu/[Emim]Cl/CrCl3 (45% YHmf at 100 \u00b0C/3 h). In that work when CrCl2 \n\nwas used instead of CrCl3, an improvement to 67% of YHmf was reached.\n9\n A few other authors \n\nobtained lower 55-70% YHmf at the same temperature and 6 h of reaction.\n9,30-34\n\n The use of Tol as a \n\nco-solvent further improved YHmf at 4 h to 91% (Table 8.1).  \n\nThe influence of using IBMK instead of Tol as the extracting co-solvent was investigated \n\nfor the Fru/[Emim]HSO4 and Glu/[Bmim]Cl/CrCl3 systems. The mixtures of these ILs with Tol or \n\nIBMK are biphasic. Control experiments performed without monosaccharides and analysed by  \n\nGC-MS did not reveal the decomposition of the co-solvents. Whereas the use of IBMK instead of \n\nTol led to a higher Hmf yield in the Fru/[Emim]HSO4 reaction system, the opposite occured for the \n\nGlu/[Bmim]Cl/CrCl3 system (Table 8.1). These results may be due to differences in the solubility of \n\nthe co-solvent in each IL (which may not be totally immiscible) and the distribution ratio of the \n\ntarget product in the two liquid phases. Nevertheless Li et al.\n35\n\n reported that the mixture of \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n354 \n\n \n\n[Bmim]HSO4 (in catalytic amounts of 1 mol.%) and [Bmim]Cl as solvent, without the addition of a \n\nco-solvent used in the reaction of Fru (10 wt.%; 0.62 M), led to 80% YHmf at 80 \u00b0C in 30 min.  \n\n \n\n \n\n8.2.2.4. One-pot hydrolysis/dehydration of di/polysaccharides in ionic \n\nliquids \n\n \n\n \n\nThe efficiencies of the [Emim]HSO4/co-solvent and [Bmim]Cl/IBMK/CrCl3 systems were \n\nfurther investigated in the one-pot conversion of different carbohydrate feedstocks, namely the \n\ndisaccharides Suc and Cel, and the polysaccharides D-xylan, inulin, starch, and cellulose, into Hmf \n\nor Fur under nitrogen, using conditions which were chosen on the basis of preliminary catalytic \n\ntests and to facilitate comparative studies (for Xyl and di/polysaccharide, 100 gfeedstock. dm\n-3\n\n in the \n\nIL; for hexoses, 120 gfeedstocks.dm\n-3\n\n in the IL). The molecular structures of the different types of \n\nsubstrates tested are represented in Table 1.1 of the Introduction (Chapter 1). The results are \n\nshown in Figure 8.6 and were calculated on the basis of wt.% YFur or YHmf, and for comparative \n\npurposes the yields were also calculated for the monosaccharides. The theoretical yields (TY) are \n\napproximately 64 wt.% YFur for Xyl, 70 wt.% YHmf for Fru and Glu, 74 wt.% YHmf for Suc, Mal or Cel, \n\nca. 73 wt.% YFur for D-xylan, and ca. 78 wt.% YHmf for inulin. The D-xylan/[Emim]HSO4/Tol reaction \n\nsystem gave nearly half the Fur TY at 4 h, and inulin/[Emim]HSO4/IBMK gave nearly the full Hmf \n\nTY at 30 min (Figure 8.6). These results were somewhat congruent with the observed higher \n\nreactivity of Fru in comparison to Xyl in [Emim]HSO4 (Table 8.1, Figure 8.4). \n\nFor the [Bmim]Cl/IBMK/CrCl3 system, the reaction of Suc (a disaccharide with a  ?-(1-2) \n\nglycosidic bond between Glu and Fru units) gave approximately Hmf TY (73%) at 4 h. The reactions \n\nof Mal (a disaccharide with two Glu units linked by a ?-(1-4) glycosidic bond) and Cel (a \n\ndisaccharide with two Glu units linked by a ?-(1-4) glycosidic bond) in [Bmim]Cl/IBMK/CrCl3 gave \n\napproximately half of the Hmf TY and negligible amounts of Glu were detected (Figure 8.6). The \n\nreactions of starch (a polymer of Glu units containing ?-(1-4) glycosidic bonds in a linear fashion \n\n(amylose) and ?-(1-6) in a branched fashion (amylopectin)) and cellulose (a polymer of Glu units \n\nlinked by ?-(1-4) glycosidic bonds) in [Bmim]Cl/IBMK/CrCl3 gave negligible Hmf yield, for residence \n\ntimes up to 4 h.

In general, theoretical yields vary between 70 and 80 wt.%. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe dissolution of cellulose in [Amim]Cl ILs was greatly assisted by the high chloride ion \n\nconcentration, which led to disruption of the extensive hydrogen bonding network present in its \n\nmacrostructure.\n2,36-38\n\n Accordingly, the sluggish reaction for cellulose/[Bmim]Cl/IBMK/CrCl3 was \n\nprobably not due entirely to solubility limitations. A possible explanation is that the hydrolysis \n\nstep is rate limiting and demands a stronger acidity (Br\u00f6nsted rather than Lewis type). Li and \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n356 \n\n \n\nZhao\n39\n\n reported that cellulose hydrolysis takes place in [Bmim]Cl in the presence of HCl or H2SO4 \n\nas catalysts at 100 \u00b0C, under atmospheric pressure and without pretreatment.  \n\nAfter stirring the IL/cellulose mixtures for 5 min at 100 \u00b0C, a solution was obtained in the \n\ncase of [Emim]HSO4 (and the mixture was light brown), whereas a heterogeneous mixture was \n\nobtained for [Bmim]Cl (apparently cellulose did not completely dissolve, and no colour change in \n\nthe reaction mixture was observed), suggesting that cellulose dissolved better in [Emim]HSO4. \n\nPrior to the reaction at 100 \u00b0C, the mixtures were treated in an ultrasound bath (50 W, 40 KHz) for      \n\n15 min, at a.t. Based on these findings and those by Zhang et al.,\n9\n an attempt was made to \n\nsimultaneously enhance the hydrolysis reaction rate of cellulose (using [Emim]HSO4 for enhancing \n\npolysaccharide solubility and giving Br\u00f6nsted acidity) and enhance selectivity of the reaction of \n\nGlu to Hmf using ([Bmim]Cl/IBMK/CrCl3) in a single reactor, at 100 \u00b0C. Hence, a mixed IL system \n\nconsisting of [Bmim]Cl/[Emim]HSO4 (2:1 v/v)/IBMK/CrCl3 was used and led to 8 wt.% YHmf  after 4 h \n\nat 100 \u00b0C (Figure 8.6). Similar results were obtained when H2SO4 (0.04 M) was added to the \n\n[Bmim]Cl/IBMK/CrCl3 system: 9 and 12% YHmf for the reactions of cellulose and starch, \n\nrespectively. The acidic IL [Sbmim]HSO4 was tested by Tao et al.\n40\n\n in the one pot \n\nhydrolysis/dehydration of cellulose to Hmf in which the YHmf was 15-24 wt.% using IBMK as         \n\nco-solvent at 150 \u00b0C and 5 h.  \n\nThe reaction of Glu using [Emim]HSO4/Tol/CrCl3 led to 96% CGlu and 7 wt.% YHmf at 4 h, \n\nwhich was similar to that observed for [Emim]HSO4/Tol (6 wt.% YHmf). Hence, the rather low               \n\nHmf yield for the cellulose reaction in the [Bmim]Cl/[Emim]HSO4 (2:1, v/v)/IBMK/CrCl3 system \n\nmay be due to the lack of selectivity in the dehydration of Glu. The CrCl2/[Bmim]Cl system \n\nreported by Zhang et al.,\n9\n was successful in converting Glu into Hmf due to the formation of a \n\nhigher halogenated anion complex. The mixed sulfate/chromium chloride IL acid systems may \n\nform different types of species, which may change (in nature and amount) during the course of \n\nthe reaction as the concentration of water varies. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.2.2.5. Identification of the reaction products  \n\n \n\n \n\nNo by-products of the Xyl reaction in [Emim]HSO4/Tol at 100 \u00b0C or 120 \u00b0C were detected \n\nby HPLC of the IL phase (using a diode array detector) and GC-MS analysis of the Tol phase \n\n\n\n  Acidic ionic liquid, [Emim]HSO4  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n357 \n\n \n\nshowed a few very weak peaks, which were not clearly identified. Thus, it was postulated that the \n\nby-products are mainly heavier products resulting from condensation reactions. \n\n The exact nature of the black residue formed in the reaction of Xyl/[Emim]HSO4  at 100 \u00b0C \n\nunder reduced pressure was unknown. Elemental analysis revealed C, H, N and S contents of 45.7, \n\n4.9, 4.8 and 8.0 wt.%, respectively (C:N:S mole ratio of 15:1.4:1), suggesting that the residue \n\ncontains the IL or an insoluble derivative thereof. The calculated values for the pure IL were: C, \n\n34.6; H, 5.8; N, 13.45; S, 15.4% (C:N:S mole ratio of 6:2:1). The solid state\n 13\n\nC CP MAS NMR \n\nspectrum of the recovered solid showed a complex series of overlapping resonances between 0 \n\nand 200 ppm (Figure 8.7): ? =23.1, 44.3, 53, 89.5, 120, 131.5, 144.2 and 159.0 ppm. The signals up \n\nto 53 ppm were presumably due to the methyl and/or methylene carbon atoms, while those in \n\nthe range 90-160 ppm were likely to arise from the carbon atoms of furan and/or \n\nimidazole/imidazolium rings. An alternative assignment for the peak at 90 ppm was a CH or CH2 \n\ncarbon bonded to two oxygen atoms (e.g. hemi-acetal), while the peak at 159 ppm may be due to \n\nthe carbonyl group of an ester (since the FT-IR spectrum showed a new adsorption band at ca. \n\n1700 cm\n-1\n\n, that is attributed to a carbonyl stretching vibration, Figure 8.8). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.7-\n13\n\nC CP MAS NMR spectrum of the recovered solid after a catalytic batch run using        \n\nD-xylose (Xyl)/[Emim]HSO4 at 100 \u00b0C/4 h. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n358 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.8- FT-IR spectra of [Emim]HSO4 as acquired (blue line), and dark solid phase obtained \n\nfrom the reaction of D-xylose (Xyl) using [Emim]HSO4 at 100 \u00b0C/4 h. \n\n \n\n \n\nLevulinic and formic acids, which are common by-products formed in the aqueous phase \n\nreactions of hexoses under acidic conditions (via decomposition of Hmf), were not detected by \n\nHPLC (using diode array detector) in the reactions of hexoses using [Emim]HSO4/Tol at 100 \u00b0C/6 h \n\nor 80 \u00b0C/24 h. \n\n The decomposition of Glu may give several by-products, such as other sugars                  \n\n(e.g. mannose) via isomerisation, C-C bond scission via a retro aldol condensation and subsequent \n\nretro aldolisantion, and non-furan cyclic ethers via dehydration.\n9,41\n\n GC-MS analysis of the \n\nGlu/[Emim]HSO4/Tol system after  6 h at 100 \u00b0C was performed to identify any volatile by-\n\nproducts.

IL stability and reuse under N2 atmosphere \n\n \n\n \n\nThe stability of the [Emim]HSO4/Tol system (under N2 atmosphere) was investigated by \n\nrecovering and reusing the IL phase in four consecutive runs at 100 \u00b0C (0.67 M in the IL).  Prior to \n\neach reuse of the IL, the two liquid phases were separated by decantation. Acetonitrile (miscible \n\nwith [Emim]HSO4) was added to the IL phase with stirring, which facilitated the subsequent \n\nseparation of dark residues by centrifugation. Acetonitrile and water were removed from the \n\nsolution by evaporation under reduced pressure, giving the recovered IL free of Fur (ascertained \n\nby HPLC and FT-IR spectroscopy, Figure 8.10). The CXyl  and YFur at 4 h remained nearly constant at \n\nca. 93 and 85% in the four consecutive runs (Figure 8.9).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.9- Conversion of D-xylose (CXyl) to 2-furaldehyde (Fur) in [Emim]HSO4/Tol for four \n\nconsecutive 4 h runs at 100 \u00b0C, using the same IL charged initially to the reaction vessel.

The CNS microanalyses, FT-IR (Figure 8.10), \n\n1\nH and\n\n 13\nC NMR spectra of the fresh and recovered IL were very similar (Figures 8.2 and 8.3). \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n360 \n\n \n\nThese results demonstrated that [Emim]HSO4 was fairly stable and can be efficiently recycled \n\nunder the reaction conditions used (catalytic reaction under N2 atmosphere). \n\n \n\nFigure 8.10- FT-IR spectra of pure [Emim]HSO4 (IL) and IL recovered from the reaction of D-xylose \n\n(Xyl) carried out in [Emim]HSO4/Tol under nitrogen, or in [Emim]HSO4 under reduced pressure. \n\nThe spectra of D-xylose (Xyl) and 2-furaldehyde (Fur) are given for comparison.  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe weak and sharp band at ca. 650 cm\n-1\n\n in the spectrum of the recovered IL under N2 \n\natmosphere was attributed to a residual amount of acetonitrile that was not completely \n\nseparated from the IL during work-up procedures. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Acidic ionic liquid, [Emim]HSO4  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n361 \n\n \n\n8.2.2.7. IL stability and reuse under reduced pressure \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the absence of Tol and under reduced pressure, the black residues formed during the \n\nreaction were separated by centrifugation and membrane filtration, leaving a transparent, pale \n\nyellow liquid. Excess water (and possibly other volatile products) in the IL was distilled off under \n\nreduced pressure. The amount of Xyl in the recovered IL was ca. 1 wt.% (measured by HPLC) of \n\nthe initial amount of Xyl charged to the reactor. The FT-IR spectra (Figure 8.10) and the elemental \n\nanalysis data of pure and recovered IL were similar. For the two runs applied, the distillate \n\nconsisted of two separate colourless liquids, which were identified by FT-IR spectroscopy as being \n\nFur and water. For the second run, 81% CXyl and 22% SFur were reached in 4 h. The similar results \n\nfor both runs suggested that the IL was recyclable, as observed for the reactions carried out under \n\nnitrogen. In summary, the YFur at 4 h are 12-18% for the reduced pressure system compared to \n\n40% for the IL without Tol, and 81% for the IL/Tol biphasic system \n\n \n\n \n\n8.3. Conclusions \n\n \n\n \n\nIt has been shown that the dehydration of Xyl and Fru, and on the other hand, the one-\n\npot hydrolysis and dehydration of di/polysaccharides containing Fru units, in [Emim]HSO4/          \n\nco-solvent gave fairly high yields of Fur or Hmf (80-90%) at 100 \u00b0C. The reaction of Xyl in \n\n[Emim]HSO4/Tol at 100 \u00b0C gave better results (82% YFur at 4 h) than previously reported \n\nDMSO/(Keggin-type heteropolytungstates or sulfuric acid) system at 140 \u00b0C.\n13\n\n Furthermore, better \n\nresults were achieved with [Emim]HSO4 than with aqueous H2SO4, under similar conditions. \n\nRemoval of Fur by evaporation under reduced pressure (instead of solvent extraction) gave \n\npoorer results, although it should be possible to improve on the 18% YFur obtained at 4 h by \n\noptimising the pressure in the system, the design and dimensions of the setup, the mixing \n\nefficiency of the reaction mixture, and the reaction temperature and residence time. For both \n\nmethods of Fur removal, the IL can be recovered and reused without a significant drop in the \n\nyields of Fur in recycling runs. In considering the potential of acidic ILs such as [Emim]HSO4 to \n\nreplace sulfuric acid in processes for the transformation of saccharides into Fur and Hmf, it must \n\nbe recalled that H2SO4 is very hygroscopic and difficult to dry in vacuum, and when heated it emits \n\n\n\nChapter 8 \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n362 \n\n \n\nhighly toxic fumes, which include sulfur trioxide, leading to the accumulation of acidic waste. The \n\nuse of [Emim]HSO4 instead of H2SO4 may allow process intensification with reuse of the acid IL.  \n\nAlthough [Emim]HSO4 was effective in converting Fru (88% YHmf at 30 min) and polymers \n\ncontaining these units into Hmf, it was poorly selective in Glu dehydration. The \n\n[Bmim]Cl/Tol/CrCl3 system of Zhao et al.\n9\n was quite effective in converting Glu and related \n\ndisaccharides into Hmf, but not polysaccharides such as cellulose and starch. For the latter \n\nfeedstocks, the addition of [Emim]HSO4 to cellulose/[Bmim]Cl/CrCl3 enhanced Hmf yield, \n\npresumably by accelerating the hydrolysis step. However, the dehydration of Glu monomers to \n\nHmf was poorly selective (8-9% YHmf) compared to Xyl for the same system without [Emim]HSO4, \n\nmost likely due to the formation of different active species from those formed in the absence of \n\nthe sulfated anions. \n\n A drawback of the IL/CrCl3 systems is that chromium (especially chromium (VI), which can \n\nbe formed from chromium (III) in aqueous environments) poses risks to human health and the \n\nenvironment, which would mean that any process based on these systems would be subject to \n\nvery stringent environmental controls. Nevertheless, the results showed that hydrophilic ILs may \n\nbe promising for Fur and Hmf production from sugar feedstocks, allowing relatively easy work-up \n\nprocedures for isolating the target product(s), reuse of the acidic medium and operation under \n\nrelatively mild conditions. Attempts to find IL systems for selectively processing feeds composed \n\nof mixed Fru and Glu-based saccharides remains a challenge. \n\nIn the next Chapter 9, the use of the IL [Bmim]Cl coupled to chromium-containing silicates \n\nin the conversion of Glu (more demanding substrate than Fru) to Hmf will be discussed. \n\n \n\n \n\n8.4.

Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nD-Glucose (Glu) is the major monosaccharide building block obtained from carbohydrate \n\nbiomass that can be converted into the promising platform chemical 5-(hydroxymethyl)-               \n\n2-furaldehyde (Hmf).\n3\n  However, the reaction of Glu to Hmf is rather demanding in comparison to \n\nthat for fructose (Fru) as substrate, partly due to the fact that the reaction mechanism is complex, \n\ninvolving several elementary steps with different acid-base requirements.  Zhao et al.\n4-6\n\n reported \n\none of the most effective catalytic systems known to date for the conversion of Glu to Hmf, \n\nconsisting of chromium salts as homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts dissolved in an ionic liquid (IL) \n\nsolvent under mild reaction conditions.\n4-6\n\n CrCl2 coupled with 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium \n\nchloride ([Emim]Cl) led to ca. 70% YHmf at 95% CGlu (10 wt.% Glu, 100 \u00b0C, 3 h reaction).\n4\n Since then, \n\nseveral chromium/IL based catalytic systems have been sucessfully investigated in the conversion \n\nof Glu (and related di/polysaccharides) to Hmf, generally exhibiting superior catalytic \n\nperformances in comparison to IL-based catalytic systems containing other transition metals as \n\nsummarised in reviews of the topic. \n7-10\n\n A few other papers have been published afterwards.\n11-16\n\n \n\nThe use of an IL as solvent instead of water is desirable because it avoids Hmf loss reactions, \n\ntypically occurring in the aqueous media.\n17\n\n Relatively low yields of Hmf have been reported for \n\nchromium salts (CrCl2, CrSO4) used as catalysts in the aqueous phase reaction of Glu, at 140 \u00b0C,\n18\n\n \n\nor of cellulose at 180 \u00b0C.\n19\n\n On the other hand, and as mentioned in Chapter 1, some ILs are \n\nfavourable (non-volatile) solvents for dissolving carbohydrates such as crystalline cellulose, in \n\ncomparison to water and most common organic solvents (important for process intensification),\n20-\n\n26\n and these types of solvents can be obtained from renewable resources.\n\n27\n \n\nHomogeneous catalytic systems require careful work-up procedures in order to avoid \n\nlosses of catalyst and contamination of effluents (requiring demanding/costly separation and \n\npurification processes and treatment/disposal of waste streams). The coupling of solid acid \n\ncatalysts with ILs as solvents is a possible approach to minimise these drawbacks. Only a couple of \n\nstudies can be found in the literature reporting on the reaction of Glu (or related \n\ndi/polysaccharides) to Hmf using (chromium-containing solid acid)/IL catalytic systems. Physical \n\nmixtures of chromium salts and solid acids (zeolites H-Y, H-BEA, H-Mordenite, H-ZSM-5, or acidic \n\nAmberlyst ion-exchange resins) coupled with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl) as \n\nIL solvent have been investigated in the conversion of cellulose to Hmf, at 120 \u00b0C, and the best \n\nresult was ca. 36% YHmf at 6 h reaction using H-Y zeolite as solid acid.\n28\n\n In a recent study it was \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n368 \n \n\nreported that the addition of ILs to aqueous solutions of Glu enhanced adsorption of the latter on \n\nzeolites.\n29\n\n Interesting results were reported for hydroxyapatite-supported chromium chloride    \n\n(Cr-HAP) coupled with [Bmim]Cl as solvent in that this catalytic system was reused four times \n\nwithout significant decrease in the yield of Hmf (ca. 40% YHmf in 2.5 min, using the microwave \n\nheating method, 400 W).\n30\n\n  \n\nA critical issue is the stability of the solid acids in the ILs medium. According to the \n\nliterature, Br\u00f6nsted solid acids may undergo ion-exchange reactions in the IL medium, and the \n\ncatalytic reactions may be effectively homogeneous in nature.\n31-33\n\n In the case of the Cr-HAP/IL \n\nsystem the homo/heterogeneous nature of the catalytic reaction was not assessed.\n30\n\n \n\nIn this work, nanoporous chromium, aluminium-containing silicates were tested as solid \n\nacids in the reaction of Glu, using the IL [Bmim]Cl as solvent, at 120 \u00b0C. The investigated solid \n\nacids include: mesoporous TUD-1 type materials possessing chromium and/or aluminium           \n\n(Al-TUD-1, Cr-Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1); zeolite BEA (in the H\n+\n-form) and Cr-BEA, and the related \n\nmicro/mesoporous composites BEATUD-1 and Cr-BEATUD-1 (Figure 9.1 A and B). Particullar \n\nattention was drawn to the stabilities of the nanoporous materials in the IL medium and the \n\ninfluence of the type of solvent ([Bmim]Cl versus water or DMSO) on the reaction of Glu. \n\n \n\n        O\n\nSi\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nAl\nO\n\nO\nO\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nSi\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\nO\n\nO\nO\n\nO\nO O\n\nCr\nO\n\nSi\n\nOO\nO\n\nO\nO\n\nO\n\nSi\n\nO O\n\nO\n\nSi\n\nO\nO\n\nO\n\n \n\n                                       A                                                        B \n\nFigure 9.1- Simplified representation of aluminium (A) and chromium (B)- containing silicates in \n\nwhich Al\n4+\n\n and Cr\n6+\n\n are in tetrahedral coordination (charges are not represented for the sake of \n\nsimplicity). \n\n \n\n \n\n9.1.1. Cr-TUD-1 and Cr-Al-TUD-1 \n\n \n\n  \n\nThe 3 D sponge-like mesoporous material TUD-1 (studied in Chapter 4 , as catalyst in the \n\nhydrolysis/dehydration of saccharides to Fur/Hmf) has several advantages, such as being \n\n\n\nCr-containing silicates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n369 \n\n \n\nstraightforward to prepare via (relatively low-cost) non-surfactant templating routes \n\n(environmentally friendly),\n31-36\n\n having high specific surface areas, pore widths and volumes, and a \n\n3 D channel system, which are favourable features for the internal diffusion of relatively bulky \n\nreactant molecules and accessibility to the active sites.  \n\nThe purely siliceous TUD-1 may be furnished with Br\u00f6nsted and Lewis acidity by \n\ntetrahedral incorporation of metals such as aluminium (Chapter 4), or chromium (in this work) \n\ninto the framework via a one-pot procedure based on the sol-gel technique.\n37-40\n\n In Chapter 4,     \n\nAl-TUD-1 was reported to be an active and stable catalyst for the aqueous-phase dehydration of \n\nsaccharides to furanic aldehydes, although the hexose-based mono/disaccharides gave less than \n\n20% YHmf. Since chromium-based catalytic systems are rather efficient in the conversion of \n\nhexoses, the incorporation of chromium in purely siliceous TUD-1 (Cr-TUD-1) and in Al-TUD-1   \n\n(Cr-Al-TUD-1) was carried out (Figure 9.1 A and B). \n\n \n\n \n\n9.1.2. Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1 \n\n  \n\n \n\nFollowing on from the good catalytic stability of BEA and BEATUD-1 (discussed in Chapter \n\n5 in the dehydration of Xyl to Fur), in this chapter the corresponding chromium-containing \n\nversions namely Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1, were tested in the reaction of Glu as substrate to Hmf. \n\nCr-BEA was prepared from BEA in the H\n+\n-form (Chapter 5) via an ion-exchange reaction, while                 \n\nCr-BEATUD-1 was prepared in a similar fashion to the micro/mesoporous composite BEATUD-1 \n\ndescribed in Chapter 5, albeit using Cr-BEA instead of BEA. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n370 \n \n\n9.2. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n9.2.1. Catalyst characterisation \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this Chapter the following materials were prepared: Al-TUD-1, Cr-Al-TUD-1 and           \n\nCr-TUD-1, BEA, BEATUD-1, Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1.  As mentioned in the experimental part \n\n(Chapter 2), the aluminium and/or chromium-containing mesoporous silicas of the type TUD-1 \n\nwere prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. BEA was prepared by calcination of NH4-BEA, while    \n\nCr-BEA was prepared by ion-exchange of a suspension of NH4-BEA in an aqueous solution of \n\nCr(NO3)3, further filtration and calcination.The composite Cr-BEATUD-1 was prepared by ion-\n\nexchange of BEA with chromium, similar to the procedure for Cr-BEA, excluding the calcination \n\nstep. \n\nThe powder XRD patterns for Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1 and Cr-Al-TUD-1 showed one broad \n\npeak at low angles (ca. 1.5\u00b0 2? for Cr-TUD-1 and Cr-Al-TUD-1 and ca. 1.8\u00b0 2? for Al-TUD-1, inset of \n\nFigure 9.2) and a very broad peak centred around 25\u00b0 2? (Figure 9.2), indicating that these \n\nmaterials were amorphous, but had mesostructured features similar to that described in Chapter \n\n4, and in agreement with the literature.\n35,37-39,41-51\n\n No evidence of crystalline phases (e.g. alumina \n\nor chromium oxides) was detected in the patterns, similar to that described in Chapter 4 and in \n\nagreement with the literature data.\n37,38,41,42,50-54\n\n     \n\n \n\n\n\nCr-containing silicates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n371 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.2- Powder XRD patterns of the fresh TUD-1 related materials (Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1, and \n\nCr-Al-TUD-1) and of the respective recW solids. The inset shows the low angle powder XRD \n\npatterns. \n\n \n\nIn the case of BEA and Cr-BEA, the XRD diffraction patterns were similar suggesting that \n\nthe crystalline structure was preserved during the ion-exchange procedure (Figure 9.3).  BEA and \n\nthe related composite BEATUD-1 presented similar XRD patterns showing the characteristic \n\ndiffraction peaks of zeolite BEA at 2?=7-8\u00b0 and 22.5\u00b0 similar to that described in Chapter 5 and in \n\nagreement with the literature data.\n55-182\n\n  The same applies when comparing the data for Cr-BEA \n\nand Cr-BEATUD-1. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n372 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.3- Powder XRD patterns of the fresh zeolite BEA-related materials and of the respective \n\nrecW solids. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe high-resolution (HR) TEM images of Cr-BEA (exemplified in Figure 9.4a) showed small \n\ncrystallites wih a size of ca. 20-30 nm and the lattice fringes characteristic of zeolite Beta. In the \n\ncase of Cr-BEATUD-1, HRTEM characterisation showed a 3 D sponge- or worm-like mesoporous \n\nmatrix with some dark gray domains that may be attributed to the embedded zeolite particles \n\n(Figure 9.4 b), suggesting that Cr-BEATUD-1 was a composite of an amorphous mesoporous \n\nmatrix and nanocrystallite Beta particles (isolated nanocrystals of ca. 20-30 nm, or aggregates of            \n\nca. 50-200 nm), which were fairly evenly distributed nanocrystals in the surrounding mesoporous \n\nmatrix. The presence of small aggregates is in agreement with previous findings for a BEATUD-1 \n\ncomposite material with a zeolite loading of 16-20 wt.%,\n56,180\n\n or 40 wt.%,\n56\n\n  and can be attributed \n\nto the combined effect of the synthesis conditions and the high zeolite loading. These results \n\nwere comparable to those previously reported in Chapter 5 for a composite material consisting of \n\nzeolite Beta and TUD-1 prepared in a similar fashion (and using the same commercial zeolite \n\nammonia Beta powder) to that used in the present Chapter. \n\n\n\nCr-containing silicates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n373 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.4- High resolution TEM images of a) Cr-BEA and b) Cr-BEATUD-1. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 9.1 shows the chemical composition and textural properties of the prepared \n\nmaterials. For Al-TUD-1 and Cr-Al-TUD-1 the atomic ratios agreed roughly with those used in the \n\nrespective synthesis mixtures. For Cr-TUD-1 the Si/Cr ratio of 150 was higher than the value of \n\n100 used in the synthesis, suggesting that a fraction of the initial amount of chromium was not \n\nincorporated in the mesoporous silicate. \n\nThe zeolite BEA and the related ion-exchanged Cr-BEA possessed similar Si/Al ratios: in \n\nthe latter case, the Si/Cr ratio was 47. Based on the aluminium contents it was possible to \n\nestimate that the BEATUD-1 and Cr-BEATUD-1 composites possessed ca. 26 wt.% BEA and 33 \n\nwt.% Cr-BEA, respectively. In the case of the chromium-containing materials, the Al/Cr ratio was \n\nslightly higher for Cr-BEATUD-1 than for Cr-BEA (ca. 6 and 4, respectively), possibly due to partial \n\nleaching of chromium from BEA during the preparation of Cr-BEATUD-1. \n\nThe textural properties of Al-TUD-1 and Cr-Al-TUD-1 were similar; in comparison, the SBET \n\nfor Cr-TUD-1 was lower, and the PSD was wider and for greater values of pore widths (Table 9.1 \n\nand inset of Figure 9.5). In the case of the composite materials, BEATUD-1 and Cr-BEATUD-1, the \n\nPSD curves lied in the range of pore widths 2.5-10 nm (Table 9.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n374 \n \n\nTable 9.1- Physicochemical properties of the prepared materials and comparison with the \n\nliterature data.  \n\nSample \n\n \n\nSi/Al  Si/Cr  Al/Cr  Surface area \n\n (m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n) \n\nVp  \n\n(cm\n3\n.g\n\n-1\n) \n\nPSD  (pore \n\nwidth, nm)  \n\nRef \n\nAl-TUD-1  20 \na\n - - 726 (789) \n\nb,d\n 0.64 (0.69)\n\nb,g\n 2.5-7  \n\n(2.5-7) \nb,k\n\n \nthis work \n\nCr-Al-TUD-1  27 (30)\n a,b \n\n 108 \n \n\n4 \n \n\n763 (995) \nb,d\n\n 0.78 (0.95)\nb,g\n\n 2.5-7  \n(2.5-7)\n\n b,k\n \n\nthis work \n\nCr-TUD-1  - 150 \n(261) \n\na,b\n \n\n- 484 (515) \nb,d\n\n 1.02 (1.14) \nb,g\n\n 3-17  \n(3-17)\n\n b,k\n \n\nthis work \n\nCr-TUD-1 - 130\n a\n\n - 565 \ne\n 1.54 \n\nh\n 8.2\n\n k\n \n\n39\n \n\nCr-TUD-1 - 130\n a\n\n - 565 \ne\n 1.54 \n\ni\n 8.4 \n\nk\n \n\n34\n \n\nBEA  12 \na\n - - 634 \n\nd\n 0.74 \n\ng\n - this work \n\nBEA 25\n a\n\n - - 500 (365/135)\nf\n nf\n\n j\n nf \n\nj\n \n\n183\n \n\nBEA 50\n a\n\n - - 557 (430/127)\nf\n nf\n\n j\n nf \n\nj\n \n\n183\n \n\nCr-BEA  13 (13)\n a,b\n\n 47 \n \n\n3.6 \n \n\n702 (793)\nb,d\n\n 0.87(0.75)\ng\n - this work \n\nCr-BEA 25\n a\n\n 0.99 \nc\n - 488 (341/147)\n\nf\n nf\n\n j\n nf \n\nj\n \n\n183\n \n\nCr-BEA 50\n a\n\n 0.74 \nc\n - 415 (334/111)\n\nf\n nf\n\n j\n nf \n\nj\n \n\n183\n \n\nBEATUD-1   31 (33)\n a,b\n\n - - 685 (722) \nb,d\n\n 0.78 (0.82) \nb,g\n\n 2.5-10   \n(2.5-10)\n\n b,k\n \n\nthis work \n\nCr-BEATUD-1 41 (45)\n a,b\n\n 236 5.8  \n \n\n802 (717) \nb,d\n\n 0.92 (0.80) \nb,g\n\n 2.5-10 \n(2.5-10)\n\nb,k\n \n\nthis work \n\na) Determined by ICP-AES. b) Values in brackets in the entries of this work refer to recovered and calcined solids (recC). c) Chromium \npercentage (wt.%). d) SBET determined by BET equation for relative pressures p/po in the range of 0.02-0.1. e) Surface area calculated \nfrom the adsorption branch of the N2 isotherm, using the BJH method. f) SBET determined by the BET equation; values in parenthesis \nrefer to Smicro/Smeso. g) Vp determined using the Gurvitch equation for p/p0 ca. 0.98. h) Vp using the BJH method. i) Vmeso using the BJH \nmethod. j) nf= information not found. k) PDS calculated by BJH method from the adsorption branch of the isotherm.

For the three tested solvents, Glu was always completely dissolved in the reaction medium. \n\nFor water and DMSO, the reaction of Glu was very sluggish: 3% YHmf at 28% CGlu for DMSO; 2% CGlu \n\nat 3 h and no Hmf was detected for water as the solvent. These results were much poorer than \n\nthose observed for the Cr-Al-TUD-1/IL system (54% YHmf), suggesting that [Bmim]Cl was a \n\nfavourable solvent for the target reaction studied. \n\nFor Al-TUD-1, the use of IL as solvent under moderate conditions did not improve the      \n\nHmf yield in comparison to that described in Chapter 4 for a  similar material Al-TUD-1 (Si/Al=21) \n\ntested as catalyst in the same reaction using a biphasic Wt:Tol solvent system (&lt;20% YHmf at      \n\n170 \u00b0C). \n\nA comparative study for the different solid acid/IL systems showed that the catalytic \n\nsystems without chromium led to fairly high CGlu (65-85%), but low YHmf (9-13%) compared to \n\nthose observed for the related chromium-containing systems (36-58% YHmf, Table 9.2). In the case \n\nof Al-TUD-1 and Cr-Al-TUD-1, which possessed similar Si/Al ratios and textural properties,                 \n\nCr-Al-TUD-1 led to a much higher yield of Hmf. In parallel with these results, the Cr-BEA/IL and Cr-\n\nBEATUD-1/IL systems led to higher yield of Hmf than the related BEA/IL and BEATUD-1/IL systems, \n\nrespectively. Similar results were reported in the literature for the reaction of Glu in the presence \n\nof a hydroxyapatite-supported chromium chloride, using [Bmim]Cl as solvent (denoted Cr-HAP/IL \n\nsystem), in that higher yields of Hmf were reached than the related system without chromium \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n380 \n \n\n(denoted HAP/IL), under similar reaction conditions: 40% and 8% YHmf for Cr-HAP/IL and HAP/IL, \n\nrespectively, at 78-81% CGlu (microwave heating, 400 W, 2-3 min).\n30\n\n   \n\nThe Hmf selectivity for the Cr-TUD-1/IL system was very high (> 90% at 42% CGlu,         \n\nTable 9.2). Hence, while Br\u00f6nsted acid sites (B) seemed to account for enhanced reaction rate of \n\nGlu, they were poorly selective in the conversion of Glu to Hmf (favouring side-reactions). Poor \n\ncatalytic results have been reported in the literature for the reaction of Glu in the presence of a \n\nmixture of Br\u00f6nsted acid and transition metal-containing catalysts, namely a phosphotungstic acid \n\nand chromium-containing metal-organic framework MIL-101, using [Emim]Cl as solvent (2% YHmf, \n\n21% CGlu, at 100 \u00b0C/3 h). It was postulated that the reaction was Br\u00f6nsted acid-catalysed.\n32\n\n \n\nPreviously investigated IL-based homogeneous catalytic systems possessing Br\u00f6nsted \n\nacidity, such as H2SO4/[Emim]Cl,\n4\n Br\u00f6nsted acid-functionalised ILs ([Emim]HSO4, Chapter 8), and \n\nBr\u00f6nsted acid ILs ([Bmim]HSO4 or [Hmim]HSO4) coupled with Lewis acid CrCl3,\n207\n\n were poorly \n\neffective in the conversion of Glu to Hmf. According to the literature, and as explained in Chapter \n\n1, the mechanism of the reaction of Glu to Hmf using chromium chloride salt/[Emim]Cl, at 100 \u00b0C, \n\ninvolved coordination chemistry between Lewis acid chromium species and Glu, accounting for a \n\nhydride transfer reaction and led to the isomerisation of Glu into Fru, which is an important \n\nprimary step in the conversion of Glu to Hmf.\n4,208\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9.2.2.2. Catalyst stability \n\n \n\n \n\nIn order to investigate the stability of the prepared materials in the IL medium, and to \n\nassess the homo/heterogeneous nature of the catalytic reaction, each of the materials was firstly \n\nput into contact with fresh IL under similar reaction conditions to those used for the Catalytic BR \n\nexperiments, but without adding Glu. After stirring for 3 h at 120 \u00b0C, the solid was separated from \n\nthe IL by centrifugation, washed with milli-Q water and dried at 55 \u00b0C overnight. Afterwards, \n\nseparate experiments were carried out with this solid and the recovered IL: \n\n \n\ni) The washed and dried solid, referred to as recW (solid acid), was tested in the reaction of \n\nGlu, using fresh IL as solvent, at 120 \u00b0C for 3 h; \n\nii) The recW solid was calcined (450 \u00b0C, 3 h, heating rate of 1 \u00b0C-min-1) to give recC (solid \n\nacid), which was tested in the reaction of Glu, using fresh IL as solvent, at 120 \u00b0C for 3 h; \n\n\n\nCr-containing silicates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n381 \n\n \n\niii) The recovered IL, referred to as recIL (\u201cname of solid\u201d), was used as solvent in a 3 h batch \n\nrun of the reaction of Glu, at 120 \u00b0C, without adding a solid catalyst. \n\n \n\nNo drastic changes in the textural parameters (SBET, Vp and PSD) were observed for the \n\nfresh and recC solids, the most significant differences were observed for Cr-Al-TUD-1 (763-        \n\n995 m\n2\n.g\n\n-1\n SBET, Table 9.1). The powder XRD patterns of the recovered TUD-1 and BEA-related \n\nsolids were similar to those of the respective fresh materials (Figures 9.2 and 9.3, respectively). \n\nHence, the prepared materials seemed to possess fairly good microstructural stability in the IL \n\nmedium.  \n\nThe FT-IR ATR spectra of the recW solids were fairly similar to those observed for the \n\nrespective fresh solid acids, and did not show bands characteristic of the IL (Figures 9.9 and 9.10).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 9.9- FT-IR ATR spectra of prepared materials and the respective recW solids.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n382 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 9.10- FT-IR ATR spectra of prepared materials and the respective recW solids in the range \n\n300-1800 cm\n-1\n\n.  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe FT-IR spectra of all the recovered (recIL) phases were also quite similar to that of fresh \n\n[Bmim]Cl, suggesting that this IL was relatively stable under the applied reaction conditions \n\n(Figure 9.11). \n\n \n\n\n\nCr-containing silicates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n383 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 9.11- FT-IR ATR spectra of fresh [Bmim]Cl and the recovered ionic liquid (recIL) phases for \n\nthe different solid acid/IL systems [denoted recIL(name of solid acid)].  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe DR UV-vis spectrum of recC(Cr-BEA) was comparable with that for Cr-BEA (Figure 9.7), \n\nsuggesting that the chemical nature of the surface chromium species were similar. Major \n\ndifferences were observed for recC(Cr-BEATUD-1) compared with Cr-BEATUD-1, suggesting that in \n\nthis case modifications of the surface chromium species occurred (Figure 9.7).  For recC(Cr-Al-\n\nTUD-1) and recC(Cr-TUD-1) the spectra showed three bands in similar ranges of wavelengths to \n\nthose observed for the respective fresh solids, although some changes in the relative intensities \n\nwere observed, which may be partly due to differences in the relative amounts of the surface \n\nchromium species. \n\nThe catalytic results for experiment (i) were poorer than those observed for the \n\ncorresponding Catalytic BR experiment: the reaction of Glu was slower (for experiment (i) the \n\nvalues for the conversion of Glu were 0.13-0.45 times the conversion of Glu in the Catalytic BR) \n\nand the yields of Hmf were lower. For the  chromium-containing systems (Cr-Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1, \n\nCr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1), the yields of Hmf values were a factor of 0.06-0.20 of the values for the \n\ncatalytic BR, against 0.11-0.36 in the case of BEA, BEATUD-1 and Al-TUD-1 (Table 9.2). The \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n384 \n \n\nobserved catalyst deactivation may be partly due to a) poisoning of the active sites and/or b) \n\nmetal leaching.  \n\nIn order to get insights into hypothesis a), the catalytic results for experiments i) and ii) \n\nwere compared (Table 9.2). For the recC solids related to the prepared materials without \n\nchromium, the catalytic results were similar to those observed for the Catalytic BR experiments \n\n(64-65% CGlu and 9% YHmf for Al-TUD-1; 80-85% CGlu and 13-17% YHmf for BEA; 69-75% CGlu and        \n\n11-15% YHmf for BEATUD-1; Table 9.2), suggesting that the applied thermal treatment fully \n\nactivated the recW solids. For the recC solids related to the prepared materials containing \n\nchromium, the thermal treatment led to enhanced Glu conversion, in a similar fashion to that \n\nobserved for the remaining solid acids without chromium (Table 9.2). However, the yield of Hmf \n\ncontinued lower than those observed for the corresponding Catalytic BR experiments (Table 9.2). \n\nNevertheless slight improvements were observed in the case of the recC solid acids containing \n\nchromium compared to the corresponding recW solid acids (9 to 12% for Cr-Al-TUD-1, 5 to 24% \n\nfor Cr-TUD-1, 10 to 28% for Cr-BEA and 2 to 13% for Cr-BEATUD-1). These results suggested that \n\nchromium species (selective) are partially leached from the solids into the IL medium (hypothesis \n\nb). In fact, ICP-AES analyses for chromium in the recC solids gave residual amounts of chromium in \n\nall cases, excluding recC (Cr-TUD-1), with a Si/Cr ratio of 261 compared to 150 for the respective \n\nfresh material (Table 9.1). In contrast, the Si/Al ratios were comparable for the fresh and \n\nrecovered chromium containing catalysts (Cr-Al-TUD-1, Cr-BEA and Cr-BEATUD-1, Table 9.1), \n\nsuggesting that the prepared materials were fairly stable towards aluminium leaching in the IL \n\nmedium: the Si/Al ratios for the recovered and calcined (recC) solid acids (recC(Cr-Al-TUD-1), recC \n\n(Cr-BEA) and recC (Cr-BEATUD-1) were 30, 13, and 45, respectively, compared to 27, 13 and 41 for \n\nthe respective fresh materials (Table 9.1). According to the above discussion (in Section 9.2.2.1.) \n\nrelated to the roles of Br\u00f6nsted and chromium Lewis acid species in the reaction of Glu, the \n\nthermally activated sites may be essentially of Br\u00f6nsted acid type (active, albeit poorly selective). \n\nThermal analyses (TGA and DSC, under similar conditions) were carried out for recW solid \n\nacids (recW(Cr-BEA), recW(Cr-TUD-1) and recW(Cr-Al-TUD-1). The DSC curves for the fresh and \n\nrecovered solids exhibited endothermic bands at temperatures lower than 175 \u00b0C and assignable \n\nto desorption of physisorbed water (Figure 9.12).  \n\n \n\n\n\nCr-containing silicates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n385 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.12- DSC curves for the recW solids related to the chromium containing solid acids and, \n\nfor comparison, for fresh Cr-TUD-1 and Cr-Al-TUD-1. \n\n \n\n \n\nExothermic bands were observed at temperatures higher than 300 \u00b0C, only for recW \n\nsolids, which may be due to the decomposition of organic matter; the latter may contribute to the \n\nobserved catalyst deactivation for recW/IL systems (hypothesis a) discussed above). Based on the \n\nTGA data, the contents of organic matter were 1.2, 2.9 and 8.1 wt.% for the recW(Cr-TUD-1), \n\nrecW(Cr-Al-TUD-1) and recW(Cr-BEA), respectively. The type of organic matter in the recW solids \n\nwas most likely related to the cation [Bmim]\n+\n since the analysed recW solids were recovered from \n\nthe solid acid/IL mixtures without Glu. It was possible that organic cations in the recW solids were \n\nconverted to Br\u00f6nsted acid sites upon the thermal activation treatment, accounting for the \n\nimproved conversions of Glu observed for the recC solids (without enhancing the yield of Hmf, \n\nTable 9.2). \n\nIn order to get insights into the homo/heterogeneous nature of the catalytic reactions \n\nusing the solid acid/IL systems, a comparative study of Catalytic BR and experiment (iii) was \n\nperformed. In general, the catalytic results for these two experiments were comparable, \n\nsuggesting that the catalytic reactions were essentially homogeneous in nature (Table 9.2). The \n\nactive soluble species may be Br\u00f6nsted acids and/or chromium Lewis acids.  In terms of getting \n\ninsights into the type of soluble active species, the reaction of Glu was carried out in the presence \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n386 \n \n\nof potassium chromate (K2CrO4) or dichromate (K2Cr2O7) in which chromium is in the oxidation \n\nstate +6. These salts were used in amounts equivalent to that of chromium added in the Cr-Al-\n\nTUD-1 solid acid and dissolved in the IL (7.2 mM chromium salt). For the two salt/IL systems the \n\nreaction of Glu was very sluggish: 1% YHmf at 30-36% CGlu, 120 \u00b0C/3 h. These results suggest that \n\nthe active soluble species in the catalysts tested herein were not oxochromium(VI) species. \n\nPossibly, fully dissociated chromium ions were leached into the IL to give chromium chloro-\n\ncomplexes. Using Cr(NO3)3.9H2O  (in which the chromium is in the oxidation state +3) instead of \n\nthe chromate salts gave an outstanding 79% YHmf at 97% CGlu, under similar catalytic reaction \n\nconditions. Figure 9.13 showed the UV-vis spectra of the recIL phases related to the solid acids, \n\nand for comparison those of freshly prepared salt/IL solutions and the respective solutions \n\nobtained after treatment under similar reaction conditions to those used for the Catalytic BR \n\nexperiments, but without adding Glu (denoted heat(salt/IL)). The spectra of Cr(NO3)3/IL and heat \n\n((Cr(NO3)3/IL) were similar, suggesting that the dissolved chromium species were fairly stable \n\nunder the applied reaction conditions. The same did not apply for K2CrO4 and K2Cr2O7, suggesting \n\nthat in the latter two cases, the dissolved species were not stable under the catalytic reaction \n\nconditions. The spectral features of recIL(Cr-Al-TUD-1), recIL(Cr-BEA) and recIL(Cr-BEATUD-1) \n\nresembled somewhat more closely those for the Cr(NO3)3 related systems than those for the \n\nK2CrO4 and K2Cr2O7 systems. In the case of recIL(Cr-TUD-1), relatively intense bands appeared in \n\nthe region 600-720 nm. These results suggested that the recIL phases contained active soluble \n\nCr\n3+\n\n species. Based on the characterisation results in Section 9.2.2.1. it was not possible to confirm \n\nthe presence of Cr\n3+\n\n in the solid acids prepared, although this possibility cannot be fully ruled out. \n\nThe active soluble species may result from direct leaching of Cr\n3+ \n\nand/or from the transformation \n\nof leached metal species. Despite the presence of Cr\n3+\n\n species in the case of Cr(NO3)3/IL system, \n\nno bands above 600 nm characteristic of Cr\n3+ \n\n(e.g. Cr2O3 clusters) were observed, possibly due to \n\nthe fact that in this system the Cr\n3+\n\n species are ions and ions do not present bands in the UV-vis \n\nspectra in this region. \n\n \n\n\n\nCr-containing silicates \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n387 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9.13- UV-vis spectra of the recIL phases related to the chromium-containing solids, and of \n\nchromium salts dissolved in the IL ([Bmim]Cl) before and after heating at 120 \u00b0C for 3 h.  \n\n \n\n \n\n9.3. Conclusions \n\n \n\n \n\nThe reaction of Glu was investigated using aluminium and/or chromium containing \n\nmicro/mesoporous solid acids coupled with [Bmim]Cl as solvent, at 120 \u00b0C. The prepared \n\nmaterials were Al-TUD-1, Cr-Al-TUD-1, Cr-TUD-1, BEA, Cr-BEA and the related micro/mesoporous \n\ncomposites BEATUD-1 and Cr-BEATUD-1. The prepared materials seemed microstructurally stable \n\nin the IL medium, and the Si/Al atomic ratios were similar for the fresh and recovered solids.  \n\nThe solid acids without chromium could be regenerated by thermal treatment, giving \n\nsimilar catalytic results to the respective fresh solids. Nevertheless, for these materials, the YHmf \n\nwere rather low (&lt;17%). In contrast, the (chromium-containing solid acid)/IL systems led to \n\nrelatively high YHmf (36-58%), although these materials could not be fully regenerated due to \n\nchromium leaching which led to a drop in YHmf (12-28%). The catalytic reactions were essentially \n\nhomogeneous in nature. It was postulated that Br\u00f6nsted acid species seemed relatively active in \n\n\n\nChapter 9 \n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \n388 \n \n\nthe reaction of Glu, albeit poorly selective in the conversion of Glu to Hmf. In contrast, chromium \n\nspecies played an effective role in the conversion of Glu to Hmf.

The \n\ndevelopment of truly heterogeneous catalytic systems based on ILs for the selective reaction of \n\nGlu and related di/polysaccharides to Hmf remains a challenge. \n\n \n\n \n\n9.4.

Conclusions \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the face of the declining petroleum resources and rising oil prices it is necessary to \n\ndevelop alternative ways to fulfill the energy needs of our industrialised society. Much research is \n\nbeing done exploring non-fossil carbon energy sources, such as renewable biomass. Especially the \n\nprocessing of plant biomass-derived carbohydrates (preferably non-edible) into added-value \n\nproducts seems to be at the core of the biorefinery concept. Saccharides constitute the bulk of \n\ncarbohydrates and can be converted to platform chemicals such as 2-furaldehyde (Fur) or             \n\n5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (Hmf) with wide application profiles, useful in different sectors of \n\nthe chemical industry. \n\nFur has been produced on an industrial scale for decades (world production of ca.          \n\n250 000-300 000 ton.year\n-1\n\n in 2005\n1-3\n\n and continued until 2011)\n4,5\n\n from biomass rich in pentosans \n\n(e.g., forest/agriculture wastes/surpluses). The hydrolysis of pentosans gives pentoses (mainly \n\nxylose, Xyl), and the latter is dehydrated into Fur. Hmf is obtained in a similar fashion from \n\nhexose-based carbohydrates, although it has not reached industrial scale production. Most \n\nindustrial processes of Fur production use water as solvent, a reaction temperature in the range \n\nof 150-200 \u00b0C, and employ mineral acids as catalysts, commonly sulfuric acid. Liquid acids lead to \n\nequipment corrosion hazards and safety problems, difficult catalyst separation from the reaction \n\nproducts, and considerable waste disposal. For these reasons, the production of Fur is one of the \n\nindustrial processes where the demand of green chemistry and technology for sustainability is \n\nstimulating the replacement of these \u201ctoxic liquid\u201d acid catalysts by stable, recyclable, non-toxic \n\nsolid acids. \n\nIn this work, solid acid catalysts as alternatives to liquid acids were investigated in the \n\nhydrolysis/dehydration of saccharides to Fur or Hmf in aqueous or ionic liquid medium, under \n\nbatch mode. Porous solid acid catalysts such as zeolites have served well the petroleum-based \n\nindustry, and hold promise as catalysts for these biomass conversion processes as they are \n\nrelatively cheap and easily recyclable. The thermal stability of the catalyst is important due to the \n\nfact that the reaction temperatures are typically higher than 150 \u00b0C and, on the other hand, the \n\ncatalyst coking phenomena are characteristically inherent to these reactions systems. Particular \n\nattention was drawn to porous inorganic oxides as solid acid catalysts due to the generally higher \n\nthermal stabilities in comparison to organic or hybrid solid acids.  \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n402 \n\n \n\nThe present work was\n\nbeing water or an ionic liquid\n\non the catalysts.  \n\nWater is the most attractive \n\ncarbohydrate-containing biomass to furanic aldehydes.

The catalyst \n\nsynthetic approaches involved the use of an organic template for introducing mesoporosity and \n\nobtaining relatively narrow pore size distributions (Chapters 4, 5, 7), use of nanocrystalline zeolite \n\nand its embedment in a mesoporous silica matrix (Chapter 5), and delamination of the lamellar \n\nprecursor Pre-MCM-22(P) (Chapter 6). It is worth noting that the investigated catalysts were \n\nmainly aluminosilicates. Aluminosilicates can be quite versatile with respect to the type of \n\ncrystalline and porous structures (micro/mesopores; 1, 2 or 3 D pore systems), the acid properties \n\nand surface polarity (varying Si/Al ratio), and they may be prepared with particle/crystallite sizes \n\ndown to the nano-scale.  \n\nComposite materials consisting of zeolite nanocrystals embedded in a mesoporous \n\ninorganic oxide matrix can minimise nanoscale-related drawbacks (high pressure drops or \n\ndemanding separation techniques such as nanofiltration) and benefit from the advantageous \n\ncatalytic properties associated with the zeolite nanocrystals. The catalytic performance of a \n\ncomposite catalyst consisting of H-Beta zeolite nanocrystals embedded in a TUD-1 type \n\nmesoporous inorganic oxide matrix tested in the dehydration of Xyl compared favourably with \n\nthose of the (bulk) zeolite BEA and the physical mixture of BEA and silica TUD-1 (74% YFur \n\ncompared to 54% YFur and 60% YFur, respectively, Chapter 5).  \n\nThrough delamination processes it was possible to prepare single crystalline sheets of \n\nzeolitic nature from lamellar precursors, allowing active sites to become accessible to the reagent \n\nmolecules and avoid diffusion limitations and decrease the rates of the catalyst deactivation by \n\ncoking. The delaminated solid ITQ-2 (Si/Al=24) possessed enhanced specific surface area and \n\nporosity compared with the lamellar precursor Pre-MCM-22(P).  ITQ-2 and the zeolite counterpart \n\nH-MCM-22 were tested as catalysts in the reaction of Xyl, at 170 \u00b0C (Chapter 6); a YFur of 71% was \n\nreached for H-MCM-22(24) and 66% for ITQ-2(24). While the delamination process considerably \n\nenhanced the external surface area of ITQ-2 in comparison to H-MCM-22, it caused modifications \n\nin the acid properties, leaving the two prepared materials (with the same Si/Al atomic ratio) on a \n\ncomparable footing in terms of catalytic performance in the studied catalytic reaction. Despite \n\ntheir similar catalytic performances, ITQ-2(24) possessed lower amounts of insoluble organic \n\nmatter, and may be advantageous in terms of energy requirements for thermal regeneration  \n\n(550 \u00b0C for H-MCM-22(24) and 450 \u00b0C for ITQ-2(24)).  \n\nMesoporous solid acid Al-TUD-1 (Si/Al=21) was tested in the reactions of \n\nmono/di/polysaccharides containing pentose or hexose units (Chapter 4). A maximum \n\n\n\nConclusions and outlook \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n405 \n\n \n\n \n\nmonosaccharide yield of 31% and 59% was reached for sucrose (Suc) and cellobiose (Cel) as \n\nsubstrates, respectively.   Al-TUD-1 was more effective in converting Xyl to Fur (60% YFur in 6 h) \n\nthan hexoses to Hmf (17-29% YHmf in 6 h), which may be partly due to the acid properties (mainly \n\nLewis acidity).  \n\n  Further improvements in the catalytic performances of the investigated \n\nmicro/mesoporous aluminosilicates may be possible by fine-tuning the textural and acid \n\nproperties: the acid properties by changing the Si/Al ratio (which will also affect the catalyst \n\nsurface polarity) or the amount of zeolite seeds in the cases of the composite catalysts, and the \n\ntextural properties by varying the particle size ranges, the template of the mesoporous solid acids, \n\nor increasing the efficiency of the delamination procedures of the lamellar precursors (increasing \n\nextension of the delamination without destroying the acid sites). On the other hand, water as \n\nsolvent can have a more detrimental effect on the catalytic reaction in the case of hexoses (Hmf is \n\nconverted to organic acids). \n\nBesides aluminosilicates and silicoaluminophosphates, zirconium-tungsten mixed oxides \n\n(Chapter 7) were investigated since they are fairly stable, versatile solid acid catalysts and some \n\nare commercially available. These types of materials were prepared by co-condensation without a \n\ntemplating agent (ZrW(X), in which X is related to the type of zirconium percursor) or by incipient \n\nwetness impregnation (ZrW-MP) with further doping of aluminium on ZrWAl-MP mesophases of \n\nzirconia (MP stands for mesoporous). The best results were obtained for ZrWAl-MP which led to \n\n51% YFur at 98% CXyl, attributed to the enhanced specific surface area and amount of accessible \n\nacid sites. \n\nAttempts to characterise the soluble and insoluble organic by-products formed were \n\nmade using TGA/DSC, FT-IR, liquid and solid state NMR techniques and GC\u00d7GC-ToFMS analyses. \n\nThese studies aimed to provide mechanistic insights and identify undesired reaction pathways. \n\nComplex mixtures of soluble reaction products were obtained and the different types of side \n\nreactions may occur, such as fragmentation reactions of Xyl and condensation reactions.  \n\nThe recognised high potential of Hmf as a bio-based platform chemical and the desire for \n\nits commercialisation led to an extensive study using IL-based catalytic systems with notable \n\nbeneficial effects; the production of Fur and Hmf in high yields from saccharides has been made \n\npossible under relatively mild reaction conditions, using IL-based catalytic systems. With an IL-\n\nbased system it is possible to suppress undesired reactions, such as the acid-hydrolysis of Hmf \n\ninto formic and levulinic acids (the latter being quite difficult to separate from Hmf, increasing \n\nproduction costs), typically occurring in acidic aqueous solutions. Furthermore, ILs may enhance \n\n\n\nChapter 10 \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n406 \n\n \n\nthe solubility of polysaccharides\n\nin the ionic liquid-based catalytic systems is given in Figure 10.3 and the IL systems tested in this \n\nwork with some of the best catalytic results are given in Figure 10.4.\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.3- Saccharides investi\n\n2-furaldehyde (Fur) and 5-hydro\n\nsystems. \n\n \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nthe solubility of polysaccharides in the liquid medium.

However, [Emim]HSO4 was poorly selective \n\nin Glu dehydration. \n\nAttempts to find IL systems to improve the conversion of Glu (which is the major \n\nmonosaccharide building block on Earth) to Hmf remains a challenge due to the more demanding \n\nreaction of Glu which has a complex reaction mechanism, involving a series of elementary steps \n\nwith different acid-base properties requirements.  ILs have been used as solvents coupled with \n\nmany different types of catalysts, mainly homogeneous (Br\u00f6nsted-type liquid mineral acids and \n\nLewis-type metal salts), and to a much smaller extent, insoluble solid acids. One of the most \n\neffective catalytic systems to convert Glu into Hmf consists of chromium chloride salts dissolved in \n\nan imidazolium chloride IL as solvent. In this work, the dehydration of Glu using [Bmim]Cl as \n\nsolvent and (Al,Cr)-silicates under mild reaction conditions was investigated (Chapter 9). The \n\nmicro/mesoporous solid acids were all microstruturally stable with no detectable Al leaching. The \n\nchromium-containing solid acid/IL systems led to relatively high YHmf (36-58%) compared to the \n\ncatalysts without chromium (&lt;17% YHmf). However, the chromium micro/mesoporous solid acids \n\nwere unstable catalysts because the chromium species leached into solution, and the catalytic \n\nreactions were essentially homogeneous in nature. Br\u00f6nsted acidity is important for the \n\nhydrolysis step (Chapter 8) but these types of active sites are deactivated in the IL medium. The \n\ndevelopment of truly heterogeneous catalytic systems for the selective conversion of Glu and \n\nrelated di/polysaccharides to Hmf remains a difficult challenge.  \n\nIn summary, different types of heterogeneous solid acid catalysts have been identified as \n\npromising for the conversion of saccharides to Fur. The solid acids have been investigated at the \n\nlab-scale, in batch mode and are essentially powders (primary particles or aggregates of relatively \n\nsmall size (micrometer range). Aiming at continuous operation mode, the catalysts need to be \n\nshaped into larger physically separate entities, the shape and size of which depends on the design \n\nof the reactor and the reaction conditions. Very recently Xing et al.\n10\n\n proposed a two-zone \n\ncontinuous biphasic reactor to produce Fur in high yields (ca.90%) from an aqueous solution of \n\nhemicellulose, with an estimate of ca. 67-80% lower energy requirements than the current \n\nindustrial process. Currently, Fur is produced from a hydrolysis/dehydration process from the \n\nground up biomass which is firstly sprayed with H2SO4 and then fed into a semi-batch reactor with \n\nsignificant quantities of steam (heat obtained from the burn of the leftover lignin and cellulose \n\nderived products).\n11\n\n The main countries producing Fur today are China, South Africa and \n\n\n\nConclusions and outlook \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n____________________________________________________________________________ \n\n409 \n\n \n\n \n\nDominican Republic.\n1\n The theoretical yield for this process is 0.73 kg of Fur per kg of pentosan, \n\nbut in practice, this process operates at only around 33% of the theoretical yield.\n12\n\n \n\nThe implementation of heterogeneous catalytic processes for producing Fur/Hmf may \n\npartly depend on whether the processing of biomass into a liquid steam of poly, oligo or \n\nmonosaccharides becomes economically feasible since otherwise severe mass transfer limitations \n\nmay exist associated with solid-solid interface catalytic reactions.  \n\nThe catalytic performances of the porous inorganic oxide catalysts could be explored in \n\nother catalytic routes of the chemical valorisation of carbohydrate biomass, and it may be \n\ninteresting to transform them into bifunctional catalysts (important for process intensification). \n\n \n\n \n\n10.2.
