However, the magnitude of\nthis effect is unknown in Southern Brazilian edaphoclimatic conditions, as well as\nthe potential of different sources of mineral N fertilizers in such an effect.  The aim\nof this study was to investigate the effects of different mineral N sources (urea,\nammonium sulphate, calcium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, Uran, controlled- release\nN fertilizer, and urea with urease inhibitor) on N2O and CH4 fluxes from Gleysol in\nthe South of Brazil (Porto Alegre, RS), in comparison to a control treatment without\na N application.  The experiment was arranged in a randomized block with three\nreplications, and the N fertilizer was applied to corn at the V5 growth stage.  Air\nsamples were collected from a static chambers for 15 days after the N application\nand the N2O and CH4 concentration were determined by gas chromatography.\nThe topmost emissions occurred three days after the N fertilizer application and\nranged from 187.8 to 8587.4 ?g m-2 h-1 N.  The greatest emissions were observed for\nN-nitric based fertilizers, while N sources with a urease inhibitor and controlled\nrelease N presented the smallest values and the N-ammonium and amidic were\nintermediate.  This peak of N2O emissions was related to soil NO3--N (R2 = 0.56,\np &lt;0.08) when the soil water-filled pore space was up to 70 % and it indicated that\nN2O was predominantly produced by a denitrification process in the soil.  Soil CH4\nfluxes ranged from -30.1 ?g m-2 h-1 C (absorption) to +32.5 ?g m-2 h-1 C (emission),\nand the accumulated emission in the period was related to the soil NH4+-N\nconcentration (R2 = 0.82, p &lt;0.001), probably due to enzymatic competition between\nnitrification and metanotrophy processes.

Solo, 34:1653-1665, 2010\n\naffected by N fertilizers, in the average of the treatments, the impact on CH4\nemission (0.2 kg ha-1 equivalent CO2-C ) was a hundredfold minor than for N2O\n(132.8 kg ha-1 equivalent CO2-C).  Accounting for the N2O and CH4 emissions plus\nenergetic costs of N fertilizers of 1.3 kg CO2-C kg-1 N regarding the manufacture,\ntransport and application, we estimated an environmental impact of N sources\nranging from 220.4 to 664.5 kg ha-1 CO2-C , which can only be partially offset by C\nsequestration in the soil, as no study in South Brazil reported an annual net soil C\naccumulation rate larger than 160 kg ha-1 C due to N fertilization.  The N2O\nmitigation can be obtained by the replacement of N-nitric sources by ammonium\nand amidic fertilizers.  Controlled release N fertilizers and urea with urease\ninhibitor are also potential alternatives to N2O emission mitigation to atmospheric\nand systematic studies are necessary to quantify their potential in Brazilian\nagroecosystems.\n\nIndex terms: nitrogen fertilization, environmental impacts, agriculture, greenhouse\neffect.\n\nRESUMO:      FLUXOS DE \u00d3XIDO NITROSO E DE METANO EM GLEISSOLO\nINFLUENCIADOS PELA APLICA\u00c7\u00c3O DE FERTILIZANTES\nNITROGENADOS NO SUL DO BRASIL\n\nFertilizantes nitrogenados incrementam os fluxos de \u00f3xido nitroso (N2O) e podem deprimir\na oxida\u00e7\u00e3o de metano (CH4) em solos agr\u00edcolas.

O presente estudo objetivou avaliar o impacto da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o\nde fertilizantes nitrogenados (ureia, sulfato de am\u00f4nio, nitrato de c\u00e1lcio, nitrato de am\u00f4nio,\nUran, N de libera\u00e7\u00e3o lenta e ureia com inibidor de urease) nos fluxos de N2O e CH4 em um\nGleissolo no Sul do Brasil (Porto Alegre, RS), em compara\u00e7\u00e3o a um tratamento controle sem\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o de N.  O experimento seguiu um delineamento de blocos ao acaso, com tr\u00eas repeti\u00e7\u00f5es,\ne os fertilizantes foram aplicados, em cobertura, numa dose \u00fanica de 150 kg ha-1 N, no est\u00e1dio\nV5 da cultura do milho.  A avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos gases foi feita utilizando-se o m\u00e9todo da c\u00e2mara\nest\u00e1tica, nos 15 dias que sucederam a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de N, e a an\u00e1lise das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de N2O e\nCH4 nas amostras de ar foi realizada por meio de cromatografia gasosa.  O pico de emiss\u00e3o de\nN2O ocorreu no terceiro dia ap\u00f3s a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o dos fertilizantes nitrogenados e a sua intensidade\nvariou de 187,8 a 8.587,4 ?g m-2 h-1 N, destacando-se as fontes n\u00edtricas com as maiores\nemiss\u00f5es, as fontes amoniacais e am\u00eddicas com emiss\u00f5es intermedi\u00e1rias e os fertilizantes de\nlibera\u00e7\u00e3o lenta e com inibidor de urease com as menores emiss\u00f5es.  As emiss\u00f5es no terceiro dia\ntiveram rela\u00e7\u00e3o direta com os teores de N-NO3- do solo (R2 = 0,56, p &lt;0,08) e ocorreram\nquando este apresentava valores de porosidade preenchida por \u00e1gua (PPA) maiores que 70 %,\no que indica que a desnitrifica\u00e7\u00e3o foi o processo predominante na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de N2O.  Os fluxos\nde CH4 do solo variaram de -30,1 ?g m-2 h-1 C (absor\u00e7\u00e3o) a +32,5 ?g m-2 h-1 C (emiss\u00e3o), e a\nemiss\u00e3o acumulada desse g\u00e1s teve rela\u00e7\u00e3o direta com os teores de NH4+ no solo (R2 = 0,82,\np &lt;0,001), possivelmente pela competi\u00e7\u00e3o enzim\u00e1tica entre os processos de nitrifica\u00e7\u00e3o e de\nmetanotrofia.  Apesar de os fluxos de ambos os gases terem sido alterados pela aplica\u00e7\u00e3o dos\nfertilizantes nitrogenados, na m\u00e9dia dos tratamentos, o impacto das emiss\u00f5es de CH4 (0,2 kg ha-1\n\nC-CO2 equivalente) foi centenas de vezes menor que o verificado para as emiss\u00f5es de N2O\n(132,8 kg ha-1 C-CO2 equivalente).

Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1653-1665, 2010\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMineral N application to the soil is a key practice\nfor achieving high crop yield in non leguminous species\nsuch as corn, sugarcane and winter cereal crops\n(Amado et al., 2002; Conti, 2007; Fontoura &amp; Bayer,\n2009).  The Brazilian consumption of N fertilizer has\nincreased at 5 % per year in the last decade,\nsurpassing two million tons of annual demand (Lopes\n&amp; Bastos, 2007).  According to the national inventory\nof greenhouse gases (GHG) emission, N fertilization\nis one of the main sources of nitrous oxide (N2O)\nemission from agriculture in the country (Brasil, 2006)\nand, in addition, studies have evidenced depressive\neffects of such practice on methane (CH4) oxidation in\nagricultural soils (Mosier et al., 1991; H\u00fctsch, 2001).\nDespite the tendency of increasing the use of N\nfertilizers, however, few efforts have been made aiming\nto evaluate the magnitude of these effects and the\npotential of different sources of N fertilizers in\nminimizing the GHG emissions, particularly the N2O,\nin the Brazilian agricultural systems (Steudler et al.,\n2002; Carvalho et al., 2006).\n\nThe N fertilization increases the mineral N\navailability in the soil (NO3\n\n--N + NH4+-N), which is a\nsubstrate for the nitrification and denitrification\nprocesses, which in turn are responsible for the N2O\nproduction in the soil (Khalil et al., 2004).  The\ndenitrification is the direct source of N2O from nitric\nN-based fertilizers, while both processes of nitrification\nand denitrification can be involved in N2O emissions\nfrom amidic and ammoniacal N sources (Liu et al.,\n2007).  Although both processes can contribute to the\nN2O emission from amidic and ammoniacal N\nsources, several studies suggested that denitrification\nis the dominant process from soils in which the water-\nfilled pore space (WFPS) is larger than 70 % (Bateman\n&amp; Baggs, 2005; Liu et al., 2007).  Taking such results\ninto account, it is reasonable to infer that the\napplication of nitric N-based sources might promote\ngreater N2O emissions than amidic and ammoniacal\nsources in poorly aerated soils (> 70 % WFPS).\n\nOppositely, however, a decline in the potential of\nCH4 oxidation has been attributed to the amidic and\nammoniacal sources due to their short and long term\neffects on soil methanotrophy rates (H\u00fcstch, 2001;\nKravchenko et al., 2002).  Nitric-based fertilizers\nusually have a small effect on the soil CH4 oxidation\ncapacity.  However, if applied at high rates and\n\ndepending upon the accompanying cation, they can\nsignificantly enhance the CH4 emission in consequence\nof the injurious effect of salinity on methanotrophic\nbacteria and cause the rise of NH4+ concentration in\nsoil solution from its displacement from exchange sites\n(H\u00fcstch, 2001).\n\nBesides the outcomes from amidic/ammoniacal and\nnitric N sources regarding soil N2O and CH4\nemissions, the adoption of microbial activity inhibitors\nand controlled-release fertilizers assume a prominent\nrole in scenarios of mitigation of GHG emissions.\nSuch inputs have markedly decreased the N losses\nby NH3 volatilization (Conti, 2007; Fontoura et al.,\n2010).  Moreover, their delaying effect on the N\nfertilizer transformation into NH 4+-N and,\nconsequently, into NO3\n\n--N, can possibly cause a decline\nin N2O emissions to atmosphere (Zaman et al., 2008;\nSnyder et al., 2009).\n\nThe study is part of an endeavor of identifying\nstrategies of mitigating GHG emission in Brazilian\nagricultural systems and aimed to evaluate the impact\nof different N fertilizers on N2O and CH4 emissions\nin a South Brazilian Gleysol.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nSoil and climate characteristics\n\nThe study was performed on the experimental area\nof the Agronomy Faculty, at the Federal University\nof the State of Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS, in Porto\nAlegre, RS (30 o 04 \u2019 S and 51 o 08 \u2019 W).  The local\nclimate is subtropical humid, with warm summers\nand cold and rainy winters (Cfa according to Ko\u00f6pen\nclassification).  The mean annual temperature is\n19.4 oC and January is the hottest month \u2013 with a\nmean of 25 \u00b0C.  The mean annual rainfall is 1,299 mm\nregularly distributed over the year.  The soil is\nclassified as Gleysol (FAO) and has 260 g kg-1 clay\nand 310 g kg-1 sand (0 to 0.20 m).  Some chemical\nattributes of the soil before the onset of the experiment\nare reported in table 1.\n\nExperimental design and treatments\n\nThe experiment was carried out on an area in which,\nfor about ten years, it has been previously cultivated\nwith corn (Zea mays L.) under no tillage system in\n\nTable 1. Soil attributes in a Gleysol at the beginning of the experiment\n\n\n\n1656 Josil\u00e9ia Acordi Zanatta et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1653-1665, 2010\n\nthe summer and ryegrass in the winter (Lolium\nmultiflorum L.), propagated by natural re-seeding.\nIn the occasion of the experiment establishment, in\nOctober 2007, the ryegrass dry mass (~3 Mg ha-1 DM)\nwas desiccated with gliphosate-based herbicide\n(3.5 L ha-1).  Corn was manually sowed at 15 days\nafter herbicide application, with an inter row distance\nof 0.7 m and number of seeds for a final population of\nabout 55,000 plants ha-1.  Sowing fertilization was\napplied for all treatments and consisted of 30 kg ha-1\nof N, 60 of P2O5 and 60 of K2O, by applying urea, triple\nsuper phosphate and potassium chloride, respectively.\n\nThe sidedress fertilization (150 kg ha-1 N) was\nperformed in a single application when corn plants\nreached the V5 stage.  The mineral N sources\n[ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3); calcium nitrate\n(Ca(NO3)2); ammonium sulphate [(NH4)2SO4); urea\n(CO(NH2)2); urea with urease inhibitor; controlled-\nrelease N; and Uran, a liquid formula of N, obtained\nfrom a physical mix of urea and ammonium nitrate],\nin addition to the control (without sidedress N\nfertilization), were applied according to a randomized\nblock design, with three replicates.  The corresponding\nfertilizer was applied on the surface, without\nincorporation, at about 0.10 m from the corn row.  A\nproportional rate of each N fertilizer was applied inside\nthe bases area (placed in the inter row region) where\nthe N2O and CH4 fluxes were evaluated.  The\ncontrolled-release N source (Sulfammo \u00ae) is composed\nby N molecules coated by an organo-mineral double\nlayer that slows down the N dissolution by preventing\nthe water entrance into its interior.  The urea with\nurease inhibitor (Super N\u00ae) is obtained from the\nNBPT (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide) addition\nto the urea.  The NBPT occupies the active site of\nurease, postponing the enzyme action for three to seven\ndays.  The relative composition of N chemical species\nin each mineral N fertilizer is reported in table 2.\n\nAir sampling and soil N2O and CH4 analysis\n\nSoil fluxes of N2O and CH4 were evaluated by using\nthe static chamber method (Jantalia et al., 2008).  In\nthe inter row spacing, three aluminum bases per\n\ntreatment (constituting three replicates) were inserted\ninto the soil at a depth of 5 cm.  The bases were covered\nwith plastic film when the fertilizers were applied to\nthe area.  Subsequently, the plastic was removed and\neach base received the corresponding N source\nproportionally to the base area (346.5 cm2).  The PVC\nchambers (20 cm height and 25 cm diameter) were\nallocated on a canal, in the top of each base, which\nwas filled with water to hermetically close the chamber\nvolume during the air sampling events.  In the top,\neach chamber contained a triple valve for fastening\nthe sampling syringes, a digital thermometer with\nan outside display for monitoring the inner\ntemperature of the chamber and a hole 1cm in\ndiameter for equilibrating the pressure during the\nplacement of the chambers on the canal.  This hole\nwas kept closed during the air sampling by using a\nrubber septum.\n\nAir sampling and N2O and CH4 analysis were\nperformed at 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 15 days after\nthe N sidedress application in corn.  On the second\nday after application, air was not sampled due to rain\noccurrence at the moment of the sampling (28 mm).\nThe sampling events always started at 9 a.m.,\nassuming that the emissions at that time represent\nthe approximate daily mean of GHG emissions\n(Jantalia et al., 2008).  Air samples from the interior\nof each chamber were taken at 0 (zero), 15, 30 and\n45 min after closing chambers, using polypropylene\nsyringes (20 mL) containing a triple Luer lock valve\nin its tip.  Immediately before each sampling time,\nthe inner atmosphere was homogenized through an\ninternal fan for 30 s.  The inner temperature of the\nchamber was monitored at every sampling time\nthrough the digital thermometer allocated in one\nreplicate of each treatment.  Additional information\nregarding the material and the sampling procedure\nare available in Gomes et al. (2009) and Zanatta\n(2009).\n\nThe syringes containing the air samples were\nrefrigerated in thermic boxes at low temperatures and\nwere transported to the lab of Environmental\nBiochemistry (UFRGS), where they were analyzed by\ngas chromatography up to 36 h after sampling.

Solo, 34:1653-1665, 2010\n\nequipment was a Shimadzu GC 2014 model\n\u201cGreenhouse\u201d, equipped with three packed columns\nworking at 70 \u00b0C, N2 as a carrier gas at a flow of\n26 mL min-1, injector with loop for direct sampling of\n1 mL and temperature set at 250 \u00b0C, electron capture\ndetector (ECD) at 325 \u00b0C for N2O detection and flame\nionization detector (FID) at 250 \u00baC for CH4.\n\nThe N2O and CH4 fluxes were estimated based on\nthe following equation.\n\nA\n1\n\nRT\nPV\n\n?t\n?Q\n\nf =\n\nwhere, f is the methane or nitrous oxide flux (?g m-2 h-1\nN2O or CH4), Q is the quantity of each gas in the\nchamber at the sampling moment (?g N2O or CH4/\nchamber), P is the atmospheric pressure (atm) in the\nchamber, assumed as being 1 atm, V is the chamber\nvolume (L), R is the ideal gases constant\n(0.08205 atm L mol-1 K-1), T is the inner temperature\nof the chamber at the sampling moment (\u00b0K) and A is\nthe chamber area (m2).  The rate of gas concentration\nincrease in the chamber was estimated by using the\nangular coefficient obtained from the relationship\nbetween gas concentration and time.  The daily\nemissions were estimated from the rates of fluxes and\nthe total emission for the period (15 days) they were\ncalculated from the integration of the daily N2O and\nCH4 emission from soil versus time (Gomes et al.,\n2009).  The accumulated CH4 and N2O emission for\nthe experiment period was converted to quantities of\nequivalent CO2-C per hectare by taking into account\nthe global warming potential of each gas in comparison\nto CO2 (23 times greater for CH4 and 296 greater for\nN2O) (Mosier et al., 2006).\n\nSoil and climate variables\n\nSome soil variables were evaluated in each air\nsampling event in order to identify driving variables\nfor N2O and CH4 emissions.  At the 0 to 0.10 m, the\ngravimetric water content, pH-H2O and the NO3\n\n--N\nand NH4+-N contents were analyzed in compound\nsamples (5 sub-samples/plot) according to methods\ndescribed by Tedesco et al. (1995).  The water-filled\npore space (WFPS) was estimated from the\ngravimetric water content and the soil bulk density\n(Gomes et al., 2009), which was analyzed by using\nthe core method at the end of the period of 15 days of\nevaluation and whose results are reported in table 1.\nLocal data of rainfall for the evaluated period were\nobtained from an Automatic Meteorological Station of\nthe National Institute of Meteorology, located about 5\nkm from the experiment area.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe effects of N fertilizers on accumulated CH4\nand N2O emission and on the N2O emission peak were\n\nevaluated by orthogonal contrasts (p &lt;10 %).  The\nidentification of the soil driving variables for CH4 and\nN2O emission was performed by evaluating the\nsignificance of determinant coefficients (R2) of\npolynomial regression and multiple linear regressions.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nSoil N2O fluxes\n\nThe N2O emission from soil was remarkably\naffected by N fertilization (Figure 1b, Tables 3 and 4).\nIn comparison to the unfertilized soil (control), N\nfertilization rised the rates of N2O emission from soil\nat about 4 to 400 times, reaching the upmost rates at\nthe third day after fertilization \u2013 which coincided with\nWFPS values larger than 70 % (Figure 1a) and with\nthe largest NO3\n\n--N and NH4+-N contents in the soil\n(Figure 2a-b).  Despite the intensity, the N2O peak of\nemission dropped sharply, reaching rates noticeably\nsmaller at only one day subsequent to the peak of\nemission (mean for N-fertilized soils = 71.1 ?g m-2 h-1 N),\nbut sustaining greater rates than the mean of the\nunfertilized soil (15.0 ?g m-2 h-1 N) up to the 12th day\n(see detail in Figure 1b).\n\nSeveral studies have depicted the occurrence of\npeaks in N2O emission following N fertilization\n(Clayton et al., 1997; Dobbie &amp; Smith, 2003; Venterea\net al., 2005).  In Brazil, a pioneer study performed in\nthe Northern region documented increases of N2O\nemission rates at 15 to 18 times in an Ultisol after\nNO3\n\n--N based fertilization (Steudler et al., 2002).\nHowever, in an Oxisol of the Cerrado region, a recent\nstudy did not evidence increases in N2O emissions\nafter the application of 60 kg ha-1 of urea, which was\nattributed to the low water content in the soil at that\nmoment (Carvalho et al., 2006), possibly enhanced by\nthe fast drainage of that soil.\n\nThe sources of N fertilizers affected, in distinct\nmagnitudes, the peak of N2O emission from the soil\n(Figure 1b).  The application of nitric forms promoted\nthe largest N2O emission rates (8,587.4 and\n3,485.8 ?g m-2 h-1 N for ammonium nitrate and\ncalcium nitrate, respectively).  The N2O emission for\nammonium sulphate- and urea-amended soils peaked\nat 1,435.3 and 859.1 ?g m-2 h-1 N, respectively\n(Figure 1b), while the smallest peaks of emission rates\nwere found from soils amended with controlled-release\nN (187.8 ?g m-2 h-1 N) and with urea with urease\ninhibitor (346.4 ?g m-2 h-1 N).  The Uran fertilizer,\ncomposed of a mix of urea and ammonium nitrate,\nfostered peaks of intermediate intensity in comparison\nto the application of these sources individually\n(2,050.7 ?g m-2 h-1 N).  Although statistically similar,\nthe smaller N2O emission due to urea amendment\nthan ammonium sulphate might be due to the possibly\nlarger loss of nitrogen by volatilization, which would\ndiminish the NH4+-N and NO3\n\n--N generation and\ntheir outcomes on N2O emission.\n\n\n\n1658 Josil\u00e9ia Acordi Zanatta et al.\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1653-1665, 2010\n\nLarger N2O emission rates have been described\nfollowing ammonium nitrate application than for other\nmineral N sources (Clayton et al., 1997; Maggiotto et\nal., 2000; Dobbie &amp; Smith, 2003; Venterea et al., 2005).\nThe magnitude of the emissions in these reports,\nhowever, were usually smaller than the emissions\nherein depicted, though large rates \u2013 similar to the\ncurrent study \u2013 were already documented by\nMaggiotto et al. (2000) for soils under pasture with\nryegrass in raining years (7.528 ?g m-2 h-1 N).  In the\ncurrent study, the large N2O emissions subsequent\nto nitric-N fertilization were likely exacerbated by\nassociated effects of rain occurrence in the beginning\nof the evaluation period, poor drainage of the soil and\n\nthe elevated water table.  Such combination of factors,\nthat nourished anoxic conditions due to the large\nvalues of WFPS, associated to the great soil contents\nof NO3\n\n--N remarkably accentuated the N loss as N2O.\nIn other types of soils with similar physical and\nchemical attributes and under analogous climatic\nconditions, it is possible that the N2O emissions would\nbe smaller than those obtained in this study.  The\nparticular features of the Gleysol regarding the\ndrainage and the proximity to the water table\ndetermines the presence of a distinguished microbial\npopulation, which is tipical for the frequent anoxic\nand reduced conditions of these soils and would not\ndominate in soils under better drainage status.

Such results\nindicate that denitrification was the major process\nfor N2O generation in the current study, where the\nNO3\n\n--N content by itself explained 56 % of the N2O\nemission and the NH4+-N content in addition to NO3\n\n-\n\n-N improved the relationship in only 13 % (R2 = 0.69).\nOther evidence for the importance of the denitrification\nprocess to the N2O emission in this study was the\nvalues of coefficients in the multiple linear equation\n(Equation 2), indicating that the increase in one unit\nof soil NO3\n\n--N content promoted increases in N2O\nemission threefold larger than the increase of one unit\nof NH4+-N soil content (50.9/16.8 = 3.02), considering\nthe other variables steady.\n\n  N2O 3rd day (?g m-2 h-1 N) = 404.3 + 28.2 NO3\n--N  (1)\n\nR2 = 0.56;  p &lt;0.08\n\nN2O 3rd day (?g m-2 h-1 N) = -930.1 + 16.8 NH4+-N\n+ 50.9 NO3\n\n--N        (2)\n\nR2 = 0.69;  p &lt;0.17\n\nTwo main reasons, which do not exclude each other,\nmight explain the absence of relationship between N2O\nemission and fertilization with ammonium nitrate and\ncalcium nitrate.  Firstly, the soil NO3\n\n--N contents\nmay have surpassed the soil capacity of response in\nincreases of N2O emission under the conditions of that\nsoil.  This hypothesis was already conjectured by\nMoreira &amp; Siqueira (2006), when the authors theorized\nthat intense N2O fluxes can occur independently of\nnitrate contents in soils with NO3\n\n--N > 20 mg L-1.\nThe second reason is that, for fertilized soils, the N2O\ngeneration from denitrification may be hampered by\nthe availability of labile carbon in the soil, irrespective\nof the nitrate content (Dobbie &amp; Smith, 2003).  This\naspect is particularly important to calcium nitrate,\nwherein denitrification is the only process for N2O\ngeneration.\n\nSeveral studies suggest that denitrification is the\nmajor process related to N2O emission from soils,\nmainly under large water content conditions (Dobbie\n&amp; Smith, 2003; Liu et al., 2007).  Under these\n\nfavourable conditions and in fertilized soils, Batemam\n&amp; Baggs (2005) estimated that the N2O amount\ngenerated from denitrification was fivefold greater\nthan from nitrification.  In this context, many studies\nreported that the use of ammonium- and/or amidic-\nbased N fertilizers instead of nitric-based sources in\nhumid soils or in applications followed by rainfall or\nirrigation is an effective strategy to decrease the N2O\nemissions from such soils (Clayton et al., 1997;\nMaggiotto et al., 2000; Dobbie &amp; Smith, 2003; Jones\net al., 2005), in addition to the split rate application of\nthe N fertilizer (Wolschick et al., 2003; COMISS\u00c3O...,\n2004).\n\nThe relatively small peak intensities of N2O\nemission from the soils amended with urease inhibitor\nurea and controlled-release N evidence their potencial\nas alternative sources efficient to diminish the N2O\nemissions credited to N fertilizations (Figure 1b),\ncorroborating the previous results of Zaman et al.\n(2008).  The urease inhibitor presence and the\nrestriction from the protective layer against water\nentrance around the fertilizer postpone and decrease\nthe NH4+ concentration in the soil, restraining the\nnitrification and, consequently, the denitrification\nprocess.  However, oppositely to the expected results,\nthe NH4+ contents in the soil amended with these N\nsources were as large as those from the soil amended\nwith normal urea, suggesting that the product did\nnot hamper the urea hydrolysis to NH4+ at the soil\nhumidity conditions of the experiment.  Therefore,\nthe smaller N2O emissions from soils of these\ntreatments were not necessarily due to the effects of\nthe urease inhibitor or due to the controlled-release of\nN, but were probably attributed to the lesser\nnitrification rate of NH4+ in conditions of large soil\nhumidity.  Batemam &amp; Baggs (2005) reported a liquid\nnitrification of NH4+ of about 1 mg kg-1 d-1 N in soil\nwith 70 % WFPS.  Similarly, Dobbie &amp; Smith (2003)\ndid not observe effects of urease inhibitor on NH4+\ncontents in the soil, reporting inclusively greater\ncontents than in normal urea-amended soil for most\nevaluation events, which resulted in similar N2O\nemissions.  In the case of the controlled-release N,\nDobbie &amp; Smith (2003) found smaller, but consistent,\nNH4+ concentrations in the soil than the normal urea,\nwhich implied a greater emission due to the long term\nemission.  Maggiotto et al. (2000), in a study of\ncontrolled-release N for three years, observed that the\neffect was distinct according to the year.  Therefore, in\nspite of the promised results from the current study\nregarding the use of urea with urease inhibitor and\nthe controlled-release N, the potential of such products\nin decreasing N2O emissions must be systematically\ninvestigated before their recommendation for large scale.\n\nConcerning the accumulated N2O emission for the\nperiod (15 days), the use of nitric-based N fertilizers\nresulted in the emission of 3.70, 1.54 and 1.04 kg ha-1 N\nfor ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate and Uran,\nrespectively (Table 4), which were larger than the\nemissions imparted from the other N sources (0.20 to\n\n\n\nNITROUS OXIDE AND METHANE FLUXES IN SOUTH BRAZILIAN GLEYSOL AS AFFECTED...               1661\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 34:1653-1665, 2010\n\n0.68 kg ha-1 N).  The N2O emissions from nitric-N\nfertilizers corresponded to 2.46, 1.03 and 0.69 % of\nthe total N applied to the soil for ammonium nitrate,\ncalcium nitrate and Uran, respectively.  The\napplication of ammonium sulphate and urea, however,\nresulted in the loss of only 0.45 and 0.32 %,\nrespectively.  These results point that, for conditions\nfavourable to denitrification (large WFPS), the N2O\nemissions imparted from the addition of ammonium-\nor amidic-based fertilizer exclusively were about 50 %\nsmaller than from nitric-based ones.  The\naccumulated N2O emissions following the application\nof urease inhibitor and controlled-release N forms were\nsmaller than for ammonium sulphate and urea\n(Tables 3 and 4).  Application of urea+urease inhibitors\nresulted in accumulated emission of 0.22 % of the total\nN applied (0.38 kg ha-1 N), while the controlled-release\nN achieved an accumulated emission of 0.13 %\n(0.25 kg ha-1 N).\n\nThe range of N2O emission from soils in literature\nis wide and is strongly affected by the source and rate\nof fertilization, as well as by climate and soil\ncharacteristics (Clayton et al., 1997).  The emissions\nfound in the present study, however, can be considered\nas large, since the relative losses of N through N2O\nemission for only 15 days of evaluation are similar to\nannual losses from soils following application of nitric\nsources of N fertilizers (0.4 to 3.1 %), ammonium-\nbased fertilizers (0.2 to 0.4 %), amidic-based fertilizers\n(0.24 to 0.8 %) and with microbial activity inhibitor\n(0.1 to 0.52 %) (Bouwman, 1996; Maggiotto et al.,\n2000; Dobbie &amp; Smith, 2003; Jones et al., 2005).  One\nfactor that can explain the large N2O emissions of\nthe current study is the probable anoxic condition of\nthe soil due to its poor drainage exacerbated by the\nrainfall occurrence in the period subsequent to the N\napplication (Figure 1).\n\nSoil CH4 fluxes\n\nThe soil CH4 fluxes were affected by the sources of\nN fertilizer applied to the corn, but the magnitude of\nsuch fluxes were up to 300 times smaller than those\nfor N2O (Figures 1b and 3).  The CH4 fluxes ranged\nfrom an influx of -30.1 ?g m-2 h-1 C to efflux of\n+32.5 ?g m-2 h-1 C (Figure 3).  Such values represent\nthe difference between the methanogenesis and\nmethanotrophy processes in the soil.  The range in\nthe CH4 flux rates was thinner than that cited by\nVeldkamp et al. (1998) in Costa Rica soils under\nfertilization (-62.5 to +250 ?g m-2 h-1 C-CH4).  In Brazil,\nflux rates of -20.8 to + 54.2 ?g m-2 h-1 C-CH4 for high\nlands of the Mid-West region cultivated with non-\nflooded rice (Metay et al., 2007) and of -40 to +62 ?g m-\n2 h-1 C-CH4 of corn-cultivated soils in the Southern\nregion (Gomes, 2006) were documented.  Despite the\nrelatively small rates of influx of CH4 in agriculture\nsoils in general, the negative fluxes evidence the\noccurrence of methanotrophy in such soils and\nhighlight that, even for mineral N-fertilized soils, the\n\nagriculture soils have the potential to act as sinks of\natmospheric CH4, through the CH4 oxidation to CO2.\n\nThe biggest oscillation in CH4 flux rates in soil\nwere verified in the first week after N application\n(Figure 3).  Rates increased markedly (60 to 194 %)\nin one day after N application in comparison to the\nunfertilized soil (Figure 3) and were closely and\ndirectly related to the NH4+ contents in the soil\n(Equation 3).\n\n   CH4 1st day (?g m-2 h-1 C) = -23.3 + 0.39 NH4+      (3)\nR2 = 0.65;   p &lt;0.02\n\nThe soil NH4+ contents were significantly large in\nthis first week of evaluation (> 40 mg kg-1 N in soil)\nwhen compared to the control, inclusively in soils that\nreceived N fertilizers containing solely nitrate\n(Figure 2a,b), presumably due to their effect in\nincreasing the rates of soil organic matter\nmineralization.  The relationship between CH4 fluxes\nand NH4+ contents is attributed to the inhibitory effect\nof NH4+ on the methanotrophy process, responsible\nfor the CH4 oxidation in the soil (H\u00fcstch, 1998).\nAccording to H\u00fctsch (1996), this effect is very effective\nand decreases larger than 30 % in the CH4 oxidation\nrates can be detected only three hours after N\napplication to the soil.  The inhibitory mechanism of\nNH4+ on CH4 influx is complex and involves both the\nenzymatic competition for the methane monooxygenase\nenzyme (Kravchencko et al., 2002) and the toxic effect\nof composts generated during nitrification\n(hydroxylamine and nitrite) on methanotrophic\n\nFigure 3. Daily fluxes of CH4 from soil (?g m\n-2 h-1 C)\n\nfor the 15 day period after application of the\nnitrogen fertilizers to a Gleysol in the South of\nBrazil.

Accordingly to\nKravechencko et al. (2002), NH4+ concentrations\ngreater than 40 mg kg-1 N are sufficient to trigger\nthe inhibitory effect on the soil CH4 oxidation.  When\nthe soil NH4+ avalilability is large, the methanotrophic\nbacteria activity changes to the NH4+ oxidation in\ndetriment of CH4 oxidation, because the CH4\nmonooxygenase enzyme has low specificity for its\nsubstrate (H\u00fctsch, 2001).  This behavior determines,\ntemporarily, greater liquid emission of CH4 from the\nsoil, but the effect can persist for days, mainly if\nassociated to the maintenance of large NH4+ contents\nin the soil.\n\nFrom the third day on, in addition to the NH4+\ncontents, the CH4 emission was likely impacted by\nthe WFPS, when the values reached 75 % on this date\n(Figura 1).  While NH4+ is responsible for the\nmethanotrophy decrease due to the enzymatic\ncompetition previously discussed, the larger values of\nWFPS make the CH4 diffusion from the soil difficult\nand are responsible for the generation of anoxic\nmicrosites in the soil, which in turn increase the\nmethanogenesis occurrence (Kessavalou et al., 1998).\n\nAfter the seventh day of N application, the\ndifferences in CH4 influx/efflux rates in the soil among\nthe N sources decreased and, from this moment, liquid\ninflux predominated, with rates ranging from -4.4 to\n-10.1 ?g m-2 h-1 C, likely related to the decrease in\nWFPS (> 60 %) and in soil NH4+ contents (Figures\n1a and 3a-b).  The decreasing effect on soil CH4\noxidation is usually short term and completely\nreversible (Dunfield &amp; Knowles, 1995).  In laboratory\nstudies, H\u00fcstch (1998) observed a gradual\nrecomposition in the oxidation capacity after five days\nof fertilization, joined by the decrease in the soil NH4+\ncontents.  However, in field experiment, Veldkamp et\nal. ( 1998) reported the regress of CH4 oxidation rates\nto the original values only after three weeks of\nfertilization.  According to H\u00fcstch (2001), if conditions\nof low temperature, great soil water content and\nfrequent fertilization persist for long term, the decrease\nin the soil CH4 oxidation capacity can became\nirreversible due to damages in the methanotrophic\npopulation.  This long term effect is mainly detected\nwhen oxidation rates of agricultural soils are compared\nto adjacent soils under natural pastures and forests.\nIn forest soils, CH4 oxidation rates in general are\nsubstantially greater than in agriculture soils due to\nthe absence of N fertilization (H\u00fcstch, 2001).\n\nThe mean accumulated CH4 emission for the N-\namended soils was significantly larger (60 %) than\nfor the non-amended soil (Table 3), which summed\nan influx of -45.1 g ha-1 C in the 15 day period of\nevaluation (Table 4).  The calcium nitrate (-29.2 g ha-1\nC) and urea (-26.3 g ha-1 C) application promoted the\nsmallest injurious effects of mineral N fertilizers on\nthe soil CH4 oxidation and were followed by ammonium\nnitrate (-21.8 g ha-1 C) and urea with urease inhibitor\n(-12.4 g ha-1 C).  The greatest increases in the CH4\n\nliquid emission in comparison to the non-amended soil\nwere found for ammonium sulphate (100 %), uran and\ncontrolled-release N (75 %) (Table 4).\n\nThe increase in the accumulated CH4 emission for\nthe period had direct and close relation with the soil\nNH4+ content (Figure 4).  Mosier et al. ( 1991) were\nthe first authors to describe the suppressive effect of\nNH4+ on methanotrophy, after of the observation that\nthe application of 22 kg ha-1 N as ammonium nitrate\ndecreased the CH4 influx of a pasture soil in 41 % in\ncomparison to the non fertilized soil.  Veldkamp et al.\n( 1998) also reported that ammonium sulphate was\nthe N fertilizer that nourished the biggest decrease\nin the CH4 oxidation rate in the soil (60 % in\ncomparison to calcium nitrate and urea).\n\nIn addition the great soil NH4+ contents, another\nfactor that can contribute to the increase in CH4\nemission from soils fertilized with ammonium sulphate\nis the decrease in soil pH.  This fertilizer has acid\nreaction in the soil and, in the present study, promoted\na decrease in soil pH in 0.3 units, at average for the\nperiod of evaluation (Figure 2e-f).  In addition to the\ndirect effect on the methanotrophic population, the\npH decrease also prolongs the period recquired for the\nnitrification of the NH4+ applied to the soil, as\nnitrification rates are smaller in low pH soil (Moreira\n&amp; Siqueira, 2006).\n\nEnvironmental impact from N fertilizers\nconcerning greenhouse gases emission\n\nThe environmental impact of N fertilizers must\ntake into account the N2O and CH4 emissions from\nthe soil, as well as the emissions of all GHG (\u201ccosts in\nCO2\u201d) involved with the manufacture, transport and\napplication of the fertilizers.  In table 4, the N2O and\nCH4 emissions from soil are represented in quantities\n\nFigure 4.

For\nthe average among the treatments, the liquid CH4\nemission was equivalent to 0.2 kg ha-1 CO2-C, which\ncorresponded to about 500 times smaller than the\nmean for N2O emission (132.8 kg ha-1 CO2-C).  Among\nthe N-amended soils, the N2O emission range was\nequivalent to the emission of 31.9 to 476.3 kg ha-1\nCO2-C (Table 4).  After summing the emission of both\ngases and the mean cost of the fertilizers in CO2-C\n(195 kg ha-1 CO2-C), the mineral N fertilization\npromoted total emissions of 220.4 to 664.5 kg ha-1 CO2-\nC equivalent to atmosphere (Table 4).  The nitric-based\nfertilizers had emissions larger than 326 kg ha-1\nCO2-C.\n\nTaking into account these values, it is possible to\ninfer that the effect of N fertilization on the\nenhancement in the soil organic matter stocks due to\ntheir increase in biomass production can only partially\ncounterbalance the harmful impact on GHG emissions\nto the atmosphere (220.4 to 664.5 kg ha-1 CO2-C).  In\nstudies carried out in the South of Brazil, the\nuppermost rate of annual C accumulation in soil due\nto N fertilization was 160 kg ha-1 CO2-C (Zanatta et\nal., 2007; Weber, 2008).  Oppositely, however, the\nresults point out that there are possibilities to\nminimize the N2O emissions decurrent from mineral\nN fertilization and that, under large water content in\nsoil, this goal can be achieved by using ammonium-\nand amidic-based fertilizers in detriment of nitric\nsources.  This potential can be even better exploited if\ncontrolled-release N and urea with urease inhibitor\nare adopted.  Complementing these alternatives, it is\nworthy of mentioning that the adequate moment of\napplication and the adoption of split rates are key\nstrategies for maximizing the efficiency of nutrient use.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. The use of N fertilizers intensified the N2O\nemissions from the Gleysol evaluated in this study.\nThe nitric-based sources promoted larger N2O\nemissions under soil conditions of large water-filled\npore space and denitrification was the main process\ninvolved in the gas generation. Ammonium- and\namidic-based fertilizers represented better alternatives\nfor decreasing the N2O emission in this poor drained\nsoil, as well as the controlled-release N and the urea\nwith urease inhibitor.\n\n2. Nitrogen fertilization increased the CH4\nemission from the soil, but the magnitude of CH4\nfluxes in consequence of N fertilization was several\nhundred times smaller than the N2O fluxes from soil.\nThe environmental impact from such increases in CH4\nemissions due to nitrogen fertilization, therefore, was\nof low significance.\n\n3. The main driving variables controlling the N2O\nemission in the Gleysol were the nitrate content in\nsoil and the water-filled pore space, while the NH4+-N\ncontent was the main driving variable for the CH4\nemission from soil. For both gases, the main injurious\neffect of N fertilizer application to the soil on their\nemissions was ephemeral.\n\nAKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nTo the National Council for Scientific and\nTechnological Development-CNPq  (Proc. 474919/2007-\n2 and 478000/2009-0) and the State of Rio Grande do\nSul Foundation for Scientific Development-FAPERGS\n(Pronex Proc. 04/0850-0 and 10/0054-7) for financial\nsupport of the research activities related to the\nNucleus for Research in Greenhouse Gases and\nDevelopment of Low Carbon Agropecuary Production\nSystems.
