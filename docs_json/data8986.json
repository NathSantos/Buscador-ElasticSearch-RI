However, its low manganese content, associated with the \nlack of knowledge about its metallurgical properties makes it difficult for large scale \napplication. This pioneering study aimed to amply investigate this lump ore\u2019s par-\nticle disintegration. One ton of ore from the mine was homogenized and quartered. \nRepresentative samples were characterized by different techniques, such as ICP-AES, \nXRD, SEM, BET and OM. Aiming to characterize particle disintegration, three pa-\nrameters were proposed: Cold Disintegration Index (CDI), Decrepitation Index (DI) \nand Heating Disintegration Index (HDI). By using these indexes, it was possible to \nconclude that this manganese lump ore did not present significant disintegration at \nroom temperature. At medium temperature test, slight decrepitation occurred, and \nat high temperatures, intense disintegration was detected. The carbonate decomposi-\ntion and porosity growth were the main responsible factors for the ore hot particle \ndisintegration.      \n\n   \nKey-words: Manganese Ore, Technologic Characterization, Decrepitation, Particle \nSize Disintegration, Fines. \n\nResumo\n\nO Produto Granulado de Morro da Mina \u00e9 um min\u00e9rio de mangan\u00eas silicatado car-\nbonatado que apresenta grande potencial econ\u00f4mico para as empresas de ferro ligas insta-\nladas em Minas Gerais.

Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(1), 55-60, jan. mar. | 2014\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe electric reduction furnace is the \none most used in the manganese ferroal-\nloy production around the world. One of \nthe most important parts of the reduction \nprocess is the pre-reduction zone, where \nthe solid raw materials are heated by the \nheat exchange with the hot gases flowing \nupward. On the furnace top, the moisture \nand structural water are evaporated and a \npart of the manganese oxides are decom-\nposed by the ascendant gases. Only if the \nfurnace charge has a high permeability \nwill the water be adequately evaporated \nand the oxides pre-reduced [Tangstad \net al (2004), Olsen et al (2007), Faria \n(2008), Faria et al (2010), Faria (2011), \nFaria et al (2011), Faria et al (2012)].\n\nIn this context, the ore particle \ndisintegration is an important metallur-\ngical parameter which has not yet been \nwell studied for manganese lump ores. \nThe breakage of ore particles as they \n\nare heated in the furnace may produce a \nbig amount of fines and diminishes the \ncharge permeability.  The low gas flux \nwill not heat the charge adequately and \nthe oxides will not be completely pre-\nreduced. This scenario will be respon-\nsible for a top gas at high temperatures \nand with a high CO content. Therefore, \nthe use of manganese ore mixtures with \nhigh fine generation susceptibility may \ndecrease the heat exchange efficiency and \nbe a problem for the furnace operation \nand productivity [Faria (2011), Faria et \nal (2011), Tangstad et al (2004), Olsen \net al (2007)].          \n\nIn technical literature, only three \npapers about manganese ore disintegra-\ntion were found. Yoshikoshi et al (1983) \nand Tangstad et al (2004) studied man-\nganese ore fine generation by tumbling \ntests. The authors concluded that the \nmore porous the ore, the lower its me-\n\nchanical strength. However, they did not \ncorrelate their observations to the ore \nmineralogy. Faria et al (2012) studied the \ndecrepitation behavior of three Brazilian \nmanganese ores. The author showed that \nthe evaporation of structural water and \nthe oxide pre-reduction were the main \ncauses for the decrepitation phenomenon \nin manganese ores.   \n\n Having in mind the strategic \nand logistic importance of Morro da \nMina Mine, associated with the lack of \nknowledge about its ore disintegration \nbehavior, this pioneering study proposed \nan experimental method that allowed the \ncharacterization of this important metal-\nlurgical parameter. The data generated \nand good industrial planning may be \nimportant for the definition of technical \ncriteria that may guide the selection of ore \nmixtures, aiming to improve the process \ncontrol and functionality.    \n\n2. Materials and methods\n\nA ton of the studied lump ore was ho-\nmogenized and quartered. Two representa-\ntive samples were screened and two particle \nsizes were collected: 1) between 15.9mm \n\nand 9.5mm; 2) between 19mm and 6.3mm. \nThese particle sizes were characterized. \n\nThe Mn, Fe, CaO, MgO, SiO\n2\n, Al\n\n2\nO\n\n3\n, \n\nTiO\n2\n and P contents were determined by \n\nICP-OES and titration. The mineralogical \ncharacterization was performed by XRD \n(1.2o/minute \u2013 Cu source), optical micros-\ncopy and thermogravimetry. \n\nThe first proposed index allowed for \nthe characterization of the particle disinte-\ngration at room temperature. This index \nmeasured the ore\u2019s mechanical strength \nunder abrasion and impact procedures. \nThis index was defined as Cold Disinte-\ngration Index (CDI). Aiming to determine \nthe CDI, the particle size between 15.9mm \nand 9.5mm were dried and tumbled \n(3x10minutes) in a rotative tumbler \nAN4696TR standardized by ISO9246-1 \nand ISO9246-2. The percentage weight \nof fines generated below 9.5mm, 6.3mm, \n3.35mm, 1.18mm, 0.6mm and 100# sieves \nwere defined as the CDI.  \n\nTwo parameters were defined aim-\ning to evaluate the mechanical behavior \nof the heated ores. The first index was \nproposed aiming to simulate the top of the \nelectric furnace. This index was defined \nas Decrepitation Index (DI). The particle \nsizes between 19mm and 6.3mm were in-\n\ntroduced into a pre-heated oven (700oC). \nThe residence time was 30 minutes. After, \nthe samples were cooled naturally at room \ntemperature and screened at 6.3mm, \n3.35mm, 1.18mm and 0.5mm mesh. Ten \ntests were performed and the average \nweight percentage below each sieve was \ndefined as DI. Two extra conditions were \nanalyzed: decrepitation of the wet sample \n(without drying procedure) and decrepita-\ntion of samples heated under reducing gas \nflux [1.5NL/min of H2 (6%), CO2 (38%) \nand CO (56%) \u2013 similar to the constitution \nof the furnace top gas].\n\n The second index was proposed to \nsimulate the ore mechanical behavior in \nthe pre-reduction zone, where the samples \nwere heated in constant contact with \na strong reducing gas. This index was \ndefined as Heating Disintegration Index \n(HDI). The particle sizes between 15.9mm \nand 6.3mm were dried and sampled in \n\namounts of 500g. Each sample was heated \n(25oC/min) in a crucible standardized \nby ISO4696-1and ISO4696-2 under \ncontinuous flux of 5NL/min N2 (100%) \nuntil 1000oC. After, the nitrogen flux was \ninterrupted and a flux of CO (99.5%) and \nN2 (0.5%) were established (Three condi-\ntions were tested: 2NL/min, 5NL/min and \n15NL/min) and the residence time was \none hour. Aiming to build a reference, \none test was done with only N2 (100%).\n\nThe samples were cooled under a \n5NL/min N2 (100%) flux until room tem-\nperature. They were screened at 9.5mm, \n6.3mm, 3.35mm, 1.18mm, 0,6mm and \n100#. The samples were recomposed and \nsubmitted to tumbling procedures in an \nAN4696TR tumbler with a frequency of \n30rpm (10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 \nminutes). The HDI was defined as the av-\nerage weight percentage below each sieve \n(tests were done twice). \n\n2. 1 Chemical and Mineralogical Characterization\n\n2.2 Particle Disintegration\n\n\n\n57\n\nGeraldo L\u00facio Faria et al.\n\nREM: R.

The particle sizes \nbetween 15.9mm and 9.5mm were the rich-\n\nest. These manganese contents as well as the \nhigh SiO\n\n2 \ncontents, can be justified by the \n\nore\u2019s mineralogical constitution presented \n\nin Table 3. Both particle sizes are mainly \nconstituted by rhodochrosite [MnCO\n\n3\n] and \n\nspessartite [Mn3Al\n2\n(SiO\n\n4\n)\n3\n].\n\nTable 3\nMineralogical constitution of Morro da \nMina\u2019s ore (studied particle sizes).\n\n3.2. Particle Disintegration\n\nThe CDI indexes and their standard \ndeviations are presented in Figure 1. For the \nstudied tumbling conditions, the Morro da \nMina\u2019s lump ore presented low susceptibility \nto the cold fines generation. This ore present-\ned only 0.7% of material below 6.3mm mesh \nafter 30 minutes of the tumbling process. \n\nFigure 2 presents the decrepitation \nindexes for the three studied conditions. The \nstudied ore also presented low susceptibility \n\nto the decrepitation phenomenon for all \nconditions. The fines generation was more \nsignificant in the reducing atmosphere.\n\nAccording to Faria\u2019s researches (be-\ntween 2008 and 2011)(1,5), oxidized ores, \ndifferent from the lump ore studied herein,  \nhave high decrepitation indexes. According \nto him, the structural water evaporation and \nthe oxide heat decompositions are the main \ncauses for this phenomenon.  \n\nThe Morro da Mina\u2019s lump ore \nconsists mainly of carbonates and silicates \nwhich are thermodynamically stable at \n700oC (decrepitation test temperature). This \ncharacteristic coupled with the low content \nof hydrated minerals is responsible for the \nstructural integrity maintenance during the \nfast heating of the ore until the decrepitation \ntest temperature, justifying the small amount \nof fines generated.\n\nFigure 1\nCold Disintegration Indexes (CDI).\n\n\n\n58\n\nParticle disintegration of an important brazilian manganese lump ore\n\nREM: R.

Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(1), 55-60, jan. mar. | 2014\n\nFigure 6\nComparison between the CDI and HDI \nindexes measured by a 0.6mm sieve.\n\nBetween 300\u00baC and 600\u00baC, the \nstructural water present in some amphi-\nboles was evaporated and a low weight loss \nwas observed. The rhodochrosite (manga-\nnese carbonate) started its decomposition \naround 700oC. The weight loss of 12% \nindicates that during the ore heating, all \nrhodochrosite was decomposed in MnO. \nDue to the happening of the decomposition \nreaction under natural air, no differences \nwere found between the tests done under \nair or reducing gas flux.  \n\nThis ore presented high susceptibil-\nity to the fines generation during heating \ndecomposition. During the sample heating \nuntil 1000oC under continuous air flux, \n10% of the material falls below 6.3mm \nmesh and 7% falls below 0.6mm mesh. \n\nAfter 30 minutes of tumbling, 24% of the \nmaterial falls below 6.3mm mesh and 16% \nfalls below 0.6mm mesh. These results \nindicate the low mechanical resistance of \nthe heat decomposed ore. \n\nThe disintegration of this ore during \nheat decomposition under an oxidizing \natmosphere (air) may be associated with \nrhodochrosite\u2019s heat decomposition, which \nincreases particle porosity and changes the \nparticle surface shape. Some small crystals \nof espessartite, initially coupled to the \nrhodochrosite, lose their fixation, being \nfreed in very small particles. The progres-\nsive HDI index growth in function of the \ntumbling time was associated with the \nespessartite small crystal\u2019s presence, which \nis a hard silicate that works as an abrasive.\n\nFigure 7 compares total porosities \nbetween the natural and heat treated \nsamples. As in the previously mentioned \nhypotheses, the heat decomposed samples \npresent the highest total porosities, jus-\ntifying the ore\u2019s decreasing mechanical \nresistance.   \n\nFigure 8 presents the comparison \nbetween natural and heat treated particles. \nIt was possible to observe that granades, \ncharacterized for their spherical crystal \nshape, continue stable in the ore structure \nafter heat decomposition and pre-reducing. \nHowever the amount of rhodochrosite \ncrystals that occupied spaces between \ngranades decreased, leaving empty places \nand increasing particle porosity, while \ndecreasing the ore\u2019s mechanical resistance.\n\nFigure 7\nComparison between total porosities of \nthe natural and heat treated samples.\n\nFigure 8\nComparison between the microstructure \nporosities of natural and heat treated \nsamples.\n\n\n\n60\n\nParticle disintegration of an important brazilian manganese lump ore\n\nREM: R.

The lump ore from Morro da \nMina mine had low manganese content \nin comparison to the oxidized ores and \nan intermediary Mn/Fe ratio. These \ncharacteristics, associated with the high \nSiO2, Al2O3 and CaO contents, may be \nresponsible for a low metal/slag ratio, \nwhich may produce a highly reactive \nbasic slag. \n\n2. The studied ore mainly con-\nsisted of silicates (spessartite and teph-\nroite) and of one manganese carbonate \n(rhodochrosite). According to the ore \nconstitution, it is possible to classify it \n\nas silicate carbonated ore.\n3. The proposed indexes (CDI \n\n\u2013 Cold Disintegration Index, DI \u2013 De-\ncrepitation Index, and HDI \u2013 Heating \nDisintegration Index) are efficient for \nthe quantitative characterization of the \nstudied ore particle disintegration.\n\n 4. This ore has low susceptibil-\nity to cold particle disintegration and \nto the decrepitation phenomena.  The \nmoisture and the reducing atmosphere \nwere not influents on decrepitation \nphenomenon. \n\n5. The ore produced a big amount \n\nof fines during heat decomposition and \npre-reduction at 1000oC. No significant \ndifferences were observed between the \ntests with different gas flow rates [2Nl/\nmin, 5Nl/min and 15Nl/min of CO \n(99.5%) and  N2 (0.5%)]. \n\n6. The rhodochrosite heat decom-\nposition is the main factor responsible \nfor the ore particle disintegration. From \nall the fines below 6.3mm, 75% of them \npassed through a 0.6mm mesh sieve. \nThis result shows that Morro da Mina\u2019s \nlump ore when heat decomposed has a \nlow abrasion resistance.\n\n5.
