This was accomplished using the sol-gel technology with acid-base catalysis in the synthesis of the gels and adding the surfactants sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS - anionic), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB - cationic) or Pluronic F127 (F127 - non-ionic) in the sol stage. Finally, supercritical drying with CO2 was used to obtain the aerogels.\nThe chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the synthesized materials were evaluated in order to assess and compare the properties of the various aerogels synthesized with different amounts and types of surfactants.\nWith the addition of surfactants, it was found that the bulk density of the aerogels decreased (gbj ctab ~ 44; pb, sds ~ 45; pb, F127 ~ 49 kg.m 3) and gels become more flexible (\u00a30 to 15% strain ~ 1.2 kPa). CTAB increases the specific surface area of aerogels while the F127 decreases it (^s, CTAB = 436, Xs, F127 = 181, Xs, SDS = 345 m2.g'). It was also observed an apparent increase in the contact angle to about 140\u00b0 and an average 1% increase in the porosity of the aerogels when compared to the aerogels synthesized without surfactants G\u00b0b, puro ~ 53 kg.m-3; \u00a30 to 15% strain = 4.7 kPa; Xs, puro = 322 m2.g-1; 9c = 136\u00b0).\nThe FTIR and elemental analysis showed the formation of a silica matrix with methyl groups derived from MTMS and also suggested the existence of residual surfactant in the aerogel's structure. On the other hand, the zeta potential (-9.25 mV) determined for aerogel particles suggests that ionic surfactants are those that enable the synthesis of more structured aerogels derived from MTMS, which is also confirmed by the SEM results.\nThe optimization with success of the type and amount of surfactant to use in the synthesis of these gels was achieved, and some of the properties of the resulting aerogels have improved. Thus, this work helped to understand which are the best surfactants to be used with this precursor and synthesis method for tailoring the material for a given application.\nThis work also included a preliminary molecular dynamics study applied to the sol-gel system here studied. The performed simulations allowed to conclude that agglomerates of MTMS-derived structures are formed. It was also observed that regardless the number of particles used, a cluster has a maximum of 45 particles at the end of 80 ns and that the presence of surfactant during the formation of clusters appears to reduce the final maximum size of the clusters. Although there are limitations in the computational study, the work here developed gave indications on how, at an atomic-molecular level, the phenomena involved in the aerogel synthesis works. These results, although at an exploratory level, are an advancement to the\nstate of art, since this type of molecular dynamics studies had not been conducted previously for all the systems in study in this work.\nResumo\nEsta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o teve como objetivo estudar o efeito de tr\u00eas tipos de surfactante (ani\u00f3nico, cati\u00f3nico e n\u00e3o-i\u00f3nico) nas propriedades de aerog\u00e9is de s\u00edlica sintetizados com metiltrimetoxisilano (MTMS). Usou-se a tecnologia sol-gel com cat\u00e1lise \u00e1cido-base na s\u00edntese dos materiais, juntando os surfactantes dodecil sulfato de s\u00f3dio (SDS - ani\u00f3nico), brometo de hexadeciltrimetilam\u00f3nio (CTAB - cati\u00f3nico) e Pluronic F127, (F127 - n\u00e3o-i\u00f3nico), recorrendo depois \u00e0 secagem supercr\u00edtica com CO2 para obter os aerog\u00e9is.\nAvaliaram-se as propriedades qu\u00edmicas, f\u00edsicas e mec\u00e2nicas dos materiais sintetizados de forma a avaliar e comparar os v\u00e1rios aerog\u00e9is sintetizados com as diferentes quantidades e tipos de surfactante.\nCom a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de surfactantes concluiu-se que a massa vol\u00famica dos aerog\u00e9is diminuiu G\u00b0b, CTAB ~ 44; Pb, SDS ~ 45; pb, F127 ~ 49 kg.m 3) e os g\u00e9is tornam-se mais flex\u00edveis (\u00a30 to15% strain ~\n1.2\tkPa). O CTAB permite aumentar a \u00e1rea de superf\u00edcie espec\u00edfica dos aerog\u00e9is enquanto que o F127 a faz diminuir (Xs, CTAB = 436, Xs, F127 = 181, Xs, SDS = 345 m2.g '). Observa-se tamb\u00e9m um aparente aumento para cerca de 140\u00b0 de \u00e2ngulo de contacto e em m\u00e9dia 1% na porosidade relativamente aos aerog\u00e9is que foram sintetizados sem surfactantes (pb, puro ~ 53 kg.m3; \u00a30 to 15% strain = 4.7 kPa; Xs, puro = 322 m2.g-1; 0c = 136\u00b0).\nO FTIR e a an\u00e1lise elementar revelam a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma matriz de s\u00edlica derivada de MTMS e sugerem uma exist\u00eancia residual de surfactante na estrutura do aerogel. Por outro lado, o potencial zeta (= -9.25 mV) determinado para part\u00edculas de aerogel indicia que os surfactantes i\u00f3nicos ser\u00e3o os que permitem sintetizar aerog\u00e9is derivados de MTMS mais estruturados, o que tamb\u00e9m se confirmou atrav\u00e9s dos resultados de SEM.\nConseguiu-se otimizar com sucesso o tipo e quantidade de surfactante a usar na s\u00edntese dos g\u00e9is, tendo-se melhorado algumas das propriedades dos aerog\u00e9is resultantes. Assim, este trabalho contribuiu para se compreender quais os melhores surfactantes a utilizar com este precursor e m\u00e9todo de s\u00edntese, para o tailoring do material para uma dada aplica\u00e7\u00e3o.\nEsta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m incluiu um estudo preliminar de din\u00e2mica molecular, aplicado ao sistema sol-gel sob an\u00e1lise. As simula\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas permitiram concluir que existe a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de aglomerados de estruturas derivadas de MTMS. Tamb\u00e9m foi poss\u00edvel verificar que, independentemente do n\u00famero de part\u00edculas usadas, um cluster tem no m\u00e1ximo 45 mol\u00e9culas ao fim de 80 ns, e que a presen\u00e7a do surfactante durante a forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos clusters aparenta reduzir o tamanho m\u00e1ximo final dos clusters. Apesar de existirem limita\u00e7\u00f5es no estudo computacional, o trabalho desenvolvido nesse plano deu indica\u00e7\u00f5es de como funcionam a n\u00edvel at\u00f3mico-molecular os fen\u00f3menos envolvidos na s\u00edntese do aerogel. Estes\nresultados, apesar de resultarem de uma an\u00e1lise explorat\u00f3ria, s\u00e3o um avan\u00e7o para o estado da arte uma vez que este tipo de estudos de din\u00e2mica molecular nunca tinha sido realizado anteriormente para qualquer os sistemas em estudo no trabalho.\nTable of Contents\nAcknowledgments..................................................................i\nAbstract.......................................................................iii\nResumo...........................................................................v\nList of Figures.................................................................xi\nList of Tables................................................................xiii\nAcronyms........................................................................xv\nNomenclature..................................................................xvii\n1\tIntroduction...............................................................1\n1.1\tGoals................................................................1\n1.2\tMotivations..........................................................2\n1.3\tThesis Structure.....................................................2\n2\tFundamentals...............................................................5\n2.1\tAerogels -

The chosen surfactants were: Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), as anionic surfactant, Hexadecyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB), as cationic, and Pluronic F127 as nonionic surfactant. As the surfactant is added in the beginning of the synthesis, thus before the formation of the sol, the assembly of the silica skeleton is changed, modifying the structural pattern of the network. Therefore, the addition of a surfactant to the chemical system allows the tailoring of the aerogel properties without changing its composition, since the surfactant is removed during supercritical drying. The addition of different types and amounts of surfactants allows, via characterization, to find the synthesis conditions that most improves the desired properties of a MTMS-derived aerogel.\nThe end purpose of the present work is to synthesize lightweight, extremely flexible monolithic aerogels that may also show good insulation performance, in order to be used in spatial and/or terrestrial applications. Improvements in the materials properties are expected to be from a more regular silica network.\nIn order to compare the synthesized aerogels, characterization techniques such as bulk density determination, helium picnometry, contact angle, Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), elemental analysis, zeta potential, Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry (ASAP), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and uniaxial compression tests were employed.\nThis work also includes a preliminary molecular dynamics based study on the chosen sol-gel systems, performed with the GROMACS package. Molecular modeling and simulation has recently emerged as an attractive tool to establish connections between experimental and theoretical work in the chemical engineering field. In spite of being limited by the available computational resources, these simulations provide relevant insights, at a molecular level, into the changes that might occur in the studied sol-gel systems due to the presence of the surfactants.\n1 Introduction\n1.2\tMotivations\nIn recent years, researchers have found aerogels to be good candidates in several applications including space environments, building construction, decontamination of polluted media, etc. Silica aerogels are the most studied aerogels because their chemistry is easy to control. However, silica aerogels are fragile and moisture sensitive, which are their major drawbacks. The use of organically modified silica precursors, like MTMS, solves the problem of degradation by water and brittleness, as the incorporated methyl groups make the aerogel super hydrophobic and flexible. Still, there is a lack of regularity in the obtained structural pattern that may be solved in order to improve the aerogels properties.\nThe requirements for materials to be used in space environments are very tight, which means that further improvement of already good characteristics, such as low thermal conductivity and density, and high specific surface area of silica aerogels, is required. As such, the motivation for this work is to contribute to enhance these characteristics so that aerogels can have wider use in both aerospace technology and building construction, their most studied applications.\nThere is a shortage of information in literature on the effect of different types of surfactants in silica based aerogels. This work aims at shedding a light to the best type of surfactant to use in order to achieve a set of desired characteristics for an aerogel. Surfactants were chosen as additives to the synthesis as it is recognized that they can induce more regularity in the structuring of the silica matrix, giving controlled pore size and reducing the predominance of macropores in the monolith when compared to mesopores.\nThe effects of additives in sol-gel chemistry are usually evaluated in terms of final macroscopic properties that the material exhibits, but these are caused by changes in the materials microstructure. HR-SEM analysis and ASAP can give an insight into the obtained microstructure. However, these techniques do not allow us to understand the occurred changes at a molecular level, and we do not know precisely what kind of interactions happen or how the system truly behaves during gelation. The molecular dynamics simulations of the system under study comes from the need to have a better understanding of what might really occur in the structuring of the gel at a molecular level.\n1.3\tThesis Structure\nThis dissertation is divided in 5 chapters that show the work developed during the semester.\nChapter 2 approaches the fundamentals of silica-based aerogels, their properties and applications and the surfactants used. The fundamentals behind molecular dynamics and the\n1 Introduction computational tools employed are also described. The state of the art surveying the use of surfactants in the synthesis of MTMS-derived aerogels and the study of cluster conformation for these aerogels is also presented.\nChapter 3 presents the experimental and computational procedures used throughout this thesis. The methods for characterizing both the synthesized materials and analyzing the computational results are discussed here.\nChapter 4 exhibits the results obtained and their discussion.\nChapter 5 has the concluding remarks and the future prospects.\n2 Fundamentals\nThis chapter presents the basic theoretical framework behind the study developed in this thesis in a way that the reader may find it easier to understand. Concepts related with aerogels, sol-gel processes, surfactants, computational chemistry and molecular dynamics are summarized in this chapter.\n2.1\tAerogels - Historical Note and Silica Based Aerogels\nThe term aerogel was firstly used by Samuel Stephens Kistler, in 1932i1]z to designate gels in which the liquid phase was replaced by a gas, without collapsing the continuous solid network and, as such, having minimal shrinkage of the gel. To do this, Kistler applied a new drying technique that allowed the removal of the liquid that impregnated the gels after being transformed into a supercritical fluid; this was called supercritical drying. It was carried out in an autoclave, increasing the pressure and temperature so that they would exceed the critical pressure and temperature of the liquid entrapped in the gel pores. With this drying method, Kistler prevented the formation liquid-vapor menisci at the exit of the gel pores, which develop tension between the liquid and the pore walls and results in capillary pressure gradients and, thus, shrinkage of the gel[1].\nAfter the definition proposed by Kistler, a new designation was needed for the gels that had significant shrinkage of the solid network due to evaporative drying. The chosen name was xerogels. In this regard, IUPAC's definition for xerogels seems to be too wide because it defines xerogels as an \"Open network formed by the removal of all swelling agents from the gel\"[1].\nInitially, aerogels were essentially made from metal salt precursors that could give origin to an oxide gel [1]. Nowadays, silica is one of the most common materials from which aerogels are composed. Silica based aerogels have a nanostructured silica backbone and usually have high specific surface area, high porosity, low density, low dielectric constant and excellent heat and acoustic insulation properties [2].\n2.2\tProperties and Applications of Silica Based Aerogels\nSilica aerogels are amorphous ceramic materials, made from siloxane (=Si-O-Si=) bonds, and they can be composed by either hydrophobic or hydrophilic matrices. They can also show\n2 Fundamentals\nhard/brittle or soft/flexible behavior and these features are mainly dependent on the precursor used. The precursors can be mono, di, tri or tetrafunctional, depending on the RO/Si ratio. With increasing R- substitution for R-O-Si=, more =Si-O-Si= bonds are formed [1]. Some examples of these precursors and their effect in the properties of the aerogels are shown in Table 2.1. The one studied in this thesis is Methyltrimethoxysilane.\nTable 2.1 - Examples of precursors for silica aerogel synthesis (adapted from [3]).\nHydrophilic precursors\nHydrophobic precursors\nTetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS)\nOCHs\nHjCO-Si- OCHs\nOCHs\nTetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS)\nHsC\tCHs\nHsC\tCHs\nMethyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS)\nOCHs\nHsC-Si-OCHs\nOCHs\nMethyltriethoxysilane (MTES)\n\u25bc\nHard and brittle aerogels\n\u25bc\nSoft and flexible aerogels\nWith different precursors, it is possible to tailor the final properties of the silica based aerogels within an already pre-established range of desired values.

This method allows the synthesis of nanostructured materials, in particular metal/metalloid oxides. The process starts with a mixture of precursors dispersed in solution and consists in the transition from a colloid solution of primary particles (dispersed phase is smaller than 1000 nm), i.e. a \"sol\" ph8!, to a gel, in which the solid particles are arranged in a three-dimensional solid network structure that entraps the solvent [3][9]. This method of processing can be done with metal or metalloid precursors such as salts, alkoxides, oxides, hydroxides, complexes, amines and acrylates as long as they are soluble in the chosen solvent to create materials with uniform, small particle size and varied morphologies i3].\nSome of the reasons to choose the sol-gel technology to create ceramic materials are summarized in Table 2.4.\nTable 2.4 - Characteristics of sol-gel processing l3ll|0l.\nSol-gel processing\n\u2022\tProcess that forms a ceramic material from a liquid at room temperature\n\u2022\tPrecise control over the purity of the material\n\u2022\tBottom-up approach: manipulation of the materials at molecular scale\n\u2022\tYields the highest specific surface area of the methods for processing ceramics\n\u2022\tFlexible process: it can specifically create composites with considerably different properties that are otherwise not possible.\n\u2022\tCan combine organic and inorganic materials.\n2 Fundamentals\nAll methods of aerogel production by sol-gel technology encompass three major steps: gel preparation, aging of the gel and the drying of the gel (Figure 2.1).\nGel aging (In mother liquor)\nGel preparation\nPrecursor\n+ Alcohol\nC\n\nV\nI\nGel drying&lt;\nAmbient pressure drying (Xerogel)\nSupercritical drying (Aerogel)\nFreeze drying\n(Cryogel)\nFigure 2.1 - Schematic representation of typical sol-gel synthesis.\n2.3.1\tGel preparation\nIn the gel preparation stage, the precursors are mixed and the hydrolysis and condensation reactions occur. It is necessary to access the reactivity of the desired precursors in order to ensure that these are reactive enough to form a gel. The selected precursors are mixed in a liquid medium in which they are soluble/miscible. Small size alcohols are often used as solvents (ex. methanol, ethanol) for alkoxide precursors. This is due to the fact that silicon alkoxides have low solubility/miscibility in water and are miscible in several organic solvents P][3][11]. The reactional medium also contains a certain amount of water equivalents that are needed for the hydrolysis of the precursors, the first step of the gel preparation.\nHydrolysis\nThe hydrolysis reaction occurs between the precursor and water molecules, resulting in hydrolyzed species and an alcohol (in the case of alkoxides). Equation 2.1 exemplifies the hydrolysis chemical reaction for a generic silane alkoxide precursor l1!.\n= Si(OR) + H2O # = Si(OH) + R(OH)\t(2.1)\nThe amount of water present in the system influences the extent of the precursors hydrolysis. Thus, it is necessary to add enough water equivalents to have a complete hydrolysis. As the water added to the mixture can be easily manipulated, it acts as a system parameter.\nCondensation and gelation\nThe condensation reactions occur when the previously hydrolyzed species react with one another, creating siloxane bonds (= Si \u2014 0 \u2014 Si =) and releasing water molecules, as shown in Equation 2.2 for a generic silane precursor t1!.\n= Si(OH) + (OH)Si = # = Si \u2014 O \u2014 Si = + H2O\t(2.2)\nIt may also be possible to have a chemical reaction between a hydrolyzed and a nonhydrolyzed precursor species, which instead of producing a water molecule, forms an alcohol one. It is at this stage that the primary particles are formed, building the sol Pl.\nSince these reactions are carried out at room temperature, their kinetics are slow and, thus, may require several days to reach completion. Therefore, catalysts are used to speed up the sol-gel reactions. With the acid condition the hydrolysis reaction is favored, while with an alkaline condition a higher condensation rate is possible. Thus, a complete control over the gelation process is achieved by separating these conditions through the addition of acid and basic catalysts ^w, whose effects are shown in Table 2.5. Using a two-step acid-base catalysis is often required and generates similar results to those achieved with basic catalysis Pl.\nTable 2.5 - Effects of the catalyst on the sol-gel chemistry of silica gels (P1M11!).\npH &lt;6 (acid catalyst)\tpH > 8 (base catalyst)\nHydrolysis is favored\tCondensation is favored\nLinear chains\tBranched chains\nLow crosslinking\tHigh crosslinking\nThese reactions are reversible, which means that the gel formed can revert back to a sol state if the conditions at which the gel is formed are changed. This behavior is more common with acid catalysis, in which the silica chains can easily redisperse in solution Pl. With control over the gelation process it is possible to reduce the gelation time but also and more importantly control the nanostructure of the gel. Other parameters that affect the nanostructuration of the resulting gel are the nature of the solvent, the molar ratio between\n2 Fundamentals precursor and water, the molar ratio between precursor and solvent, and the type of surfactants and their molar ratio relatively to the precursor, which are the targets of this study [1][3].\nGelation is identified when there is an abrupt increase in the sol viscosity and a process similar to polymerization, which is called polycondensation, occurs. At this stage, the hydrolysis and condensation reactions are considered complete. Polycondensation occurs in all directions, forming a 3D matrix that occupies the entire volume of the sol, entrapping the solvent. Figure 2.2 exemplifies this matrix for a trialkoxysilane precursor. Particles start to aggregate with one another, going from primary to secondary particles, and form crosslinked chains in a pearl-necklace like matrix [2][3].\nFigure 2.2 - Example of a solid network from a gel formed with a tri-functional silane alkoxide.\n2.3.2\tAging of the gel\nGel aging is carried out to strengthen the gel network in order to sustain the tensions the material will be subjected to in the drying step. With the gel being reinforced, shrinkage and the presence of cracks will be minimized, allowing the control of the macroscopic properties of the gel. The reinforcement of the network takes place through the thickening of the necks between secondary particles and Ostwald ripening [1][4]. This happens due to further condensation with residual silanols and, also, because dissolution/reprecipitation of silica occurs as the reactions of hydrolysis and condensation are reversible.\n2 Fundamentals\nAging may occur either in the liquid solution from the previous step or in a specifically prepared solution. Therefore, it is possible to control and optimize this step by paying attention to parameters like the composition of the liquid phase and its pH, the temperature and pressure.\n2.3.3\tDrying of the Gel\nDepending on the type of gel drying, 3 different types of materials can be produced: xerogels, aerogels and cryogels. With xerogels being the ones that are dried at ambient pressure, aerogels those dried at supercritical conditions and cryogels the ones originated by freeze drying [2].\nTo make xerogels, the pressure is atmospheric and the temperature is raised in order to evaporate the liquid phase (Ambient Pressure Drying - APD). This drying method leads to the development of capillary stresses in the gel matrix, with large pressure gradients that causes mechanical damage and collapse of the pores as the liquid evaporates from the pores. The collapse is due to the presence of hydroxyl groups that are brought together through capillary forces and, because these are easily reactive groups, they react with one another forming more siloxane bridges and thus irreversibly shrinking the network. As such, xerogels have high tendency to shrink, becoming denser and developing cracks PJPJM.\nThis drying technique, although being much more inexpensive when compared to the next two that are going to be described next, has these problems of severe shrinking of the gel and its densification. In order to create aerogel-like materials through ambient pressure drying, other strategies were investigated to overcome these drawbacks. These are focused on the minimization of capillary forces and reduction of liquid-solid interactions. The modification of the silica surface with hydrophobic groups or the use of solvents with low surface energy, or even the use of drying control additives, such as surfactants, can significantly influence the drying process [2].\nAs said in section 2.1, Kistler was the first that implemented a plan to completely avoid the shrinkage and collapse of the gel by using a supercritical drying approach Pl. Drying with supercritical fluids can be done either at high temperatures or using supercritical CO2 and drying at low temperatures, but their principle is basically the same. It is aimed to eliminate the capillary forces due to the vapor-liquid equilibrium by surrounding the equilibrium line and surpassing the critical point to achieve the supercritical state region [41.\nIn high temperature supercritical drying (HTSCD), the gel is put together with a sufficient amount of solvent in an autoclave and the temperature and pressure are raised and adjusted to reach supercritical conditions of the solvent (usually the critical temperature if above 240\u00b0C and the critical pressure is above 60 bar). These conditions, when set, are kept\n2 Fundamentals constant for a certain amount of time and then the supercritical fluid is slowly vented out at constant temperature, until atmospheric pressure is reached. At this point, the autoclave is let to cool down to room temperature. The use of organic solvents in high temperature supercritical drying leads to rearrangements in the structure of the gel. For example, the reesterification of the surface of silica based aerogels may occur w.\nIn low temperature supercritical drying (LTSCD), the gel is put in an autoclave and then supercritical CO2 is pumped into the sealed vessel dissolving the organic solvent and extracting it from the gel. When the supercritical state of CO2 is reached, the outlet valve is opened and CO2 is continuously pumped for some time to ensure it drags and dissolves all the solvent. This drying approach has practically no impact on the gel's structure and also allows the preparation of hybrid aerogels, since their organic component does not degrade at low temperatures w. Table 2.6 shows characteristics of both high and low temperature supercritical drying.\nTable 2.6 - Main differences between high and low temperature supercritical drying iO13].\nHTSCD\nLTSCD\nTemperature\nPressure\nAdditional solvent Nanostructure changes Use of organic components in precursors\n>240\u00b0C\n> 50 atm\nNo additional solvent required Rearrangements happen\nNo (they degrade at the used temperatures)\n40\u00b0C is enough for CO2 (Tsc~31\u00b0Q\n&lt;80 bar (CO2 Psc~73 atm)\nCO2 is required\nNo impact\nPossible to create hybrid materials\nIn freeze drying, the solvent is frozen and then sublimed under vacuum. This process forms crystals within the nanostructure that lead to cracked or even powder-like silica products. Water in the solid state has a greater volume than in the liquid state, thus big crystals are formed during freezing. In order to mitigate this, solvents with low expansion coefficients and high sublimation pressure (provided that the used equipment reaches their freezing point) can be used, as well as liquid nitrogen because it freezes the solvent fast enough to form only small crystals I2!!4!.\n2.4\tSurfactants\nSurfactants touch our everyday lives in countless ways. Being present in our food, drinks, cleaning products, etc., we have been taking them for granted due to their immense potential and versatility in several areas. Since the start of their use in the past century (besides soap), the use of surfactants has matured and evolved to newer possibilities such as the ones presented in the next two subtopics. Their use in gel's synthesis is common, as they aid in the structuration of the solid network.\n2.4.1\tSurfactants Characteristics\nSurface active agents, or simply surfactants, are organic compounds with at least one lyophilic and one lyophobic group. The lyophilic group (polar or ionic) has affinity for polar solvents while the lyophobic group (non-polar) has affinity to non-polar liquids. Surfactants are molecules with at least one non-polar group and one polar (or ionic) group M. Figure 2.3 presents a typical representation of a surfactant with a lyophilic \"head\" and a lyophobic \"tail\".\nFigure 2.3 - Typical representation of a surfactant.\nDue to the opposing forces within a surfactant molecule two phenomena are possible, adsorption and aggregation. The adsorption process occurs when surfactant molecules position themselves in the interface between two immiscible liquids, in order to minimize the contact between the lyophobic and lyophilic phases, resulting in changes in the properties at the interface [14].\nAnother way to minimize the contact is by aggregation of the surfactant molecules and form what are called micelles. These micelles form even at very low concentrations, at a point that is called critical micelle concentration (CMC) [14]. Various possible micelle types are shown in Figure 2.4.\nFigure 2.4 - Typical micelle configurations.\nThese micelles are interesting because they create domains within the solution where particular solutes can be solubilized or emulsified; one good example of micelles is the membrane of cells, in biology, where these domains are vital for the cells activity [14].\n2 Fundamentals\nA surfactant may carry a negative or positive charge, both or no charge at all. Thus, they can be classified as anionic, cationic, amphoteric (or zwitterionic), behaving at the same time as anionic and cationic surfactants at some pH levels) or non-ionic, respectively M.\nSome applications of surfactants are shown in Table 2.7 to illustrate their diversity.\nTable 2.7 - List of some applications of surfactants (adapted from Farn (2006) M).\nArea of application\tExample\n\u2022\tAgrochemical formulations \u2022\tCivil engineering \u2022\tCosmetics and toiletries \u2022\tDetergents \u2022\tFood industry\tWater dispersible granules Bitumen additives to give wet adhesion to road aggregates Shampoos, soap, bubble baths and shower gels Dishwashing liquids; Clothes washing liquids/powders Food grade emulsifiers\n2.4.2\tSurfactants and MTMS Based Aerogels - State of the Art\nSurfactants applied in sol-gel technology are mainly used as templates, acting as porogenic agents by occupying space in the forming matrix of the gel, and also as structuredirecting agents (SDAs). Since surfactants tend to organize themselves, it is also theoretically possible to tailor the gel nanostructure to create mostly mesopores (2 - 50 nm). This is a cooperative assembly process between organic surfactants and inorganic precursors (or hybrid precursors, like the MTMS used in this thesis) that form inorganic/organic mesostructured composites. Hence, the surfactant self-assembly is an essential part for the formation of ordered mesostructures [15]. In this way, the resulting gel-matrix which will have an ordered network with the lowest interface energy due to the adsorption phenomenon of the surfactants in the precursors molecules [15].\nTable 2.8 and Table 2.9 present the works elected as support for this thesis. These are connected with this thesis, because they used at least one surfactant and the MTMS precursor.\n2 Fundamentals\nTable 2.8 - Articles from literature with experimental procedures of interest for the present work, presenting gel synthesis with MTMS and surfactants.\nArticle Chemical System\nExperimental Procedure\nRelevant Conclusions\nPrecursor/Co-precursor:\nMTMS and DMDMS\nSolvent:\nMethanol\nHayase et Catalysts:\nal., 2013[16]\tAcetic acid and urea\nSurfactant:\nn-\nhexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC)\n\u2022Stirred for 60 min. to promote hydrolysis;\n\u2022\tSolution placed in an oven for gelation at 80\u00b0C for several hours;\n\u2022Washing with alcohol;\n\u2022\tDrying at APD conditions.\n\u2022\tCopolymerization\twith\ndifferent\talkoxysilanes\nimproves the chemical properties of the gels;\n\u2022\tIntroduction of different functional groups leads to superhydrophobic materials for use as a compound separation medium;\n\u2022Elastic properties (80\t%\nrecovery ratio) are maintained over a wide range of temperature.\nPrecursor:\nMTMS\nSolvent:\nHayase et Methanol and 2-propanol al., 2012[17]\tCatalysts:\nAcetic acid and urea\nSurfactant:\nCTAC\n\u2022One-pot sol-gel process;\n\u2022\tThe starting composition includes 10 mL of aqueous acetic acid (5 mM), 0.40 g of CTAC and 3 g of urea dissolved in a glass sample tube;\n\u2022\t5 mL of MTMS are added to the solution under stirring for 30 min at room temperature; \u2022Gelation and aging at 60\u00b0C, in a closed vessel, for 4 days;\n\u2022\tFor 8 hours, the gel is washed with methanol and 2-propanol, three times each;\n\u2022\tSupercritical drying with CO2, for 10 h., at 80\u00b0C and 14 MPa;\n\u2022Molar ratios used: MTMS:water:acetic acid:urea:CTAC\n1:1.6x10:1.4x10'3:1.4:3.6x10T\n\u2022\tTransparent aerogels;\n\u2022\tDifferent surfactant/precursor\nmolar ratios change the light transmittance: (0.10 g of CTAC [CTAC]/[MTMS]=0.009 to 0.40 g of\tCTAC\n[CTAC]/[MTMS]=0.036);\n\u2022The light transmittance decreases with increasing quantity of CTAC;\n\u2022\tConcentrations of catalysts affect the network and porous structure of the gels; with more urea the lower aerogel density is obtained;\n\u2022\tAn increasing ratio of solvent/MTMS leads to higher shrinkage;\n\u2022Using the surfactant, the minimal density of 0.045 g.cm-3 is obtained.\n\u2022\tProperty values:\npb > 45 km.m-3, T &lt;91 %, e > 90 %, E > 0.8 MPa\n2 Fundamentals\nTable 2.8 - Articles from literature with experimental procedures of interest for the present work, presenting gel synthesis with MTMS and surfactants.

However, the synthesis system was different, delivering rigid aerogels. These works used different catalysts (acetic acid and urea) from the ones used in this work. In the current work, the synthesis of gels was done via a two-step acid-base process with oxalic acid and ammonium hydroxide catalysts, similar to the systems presented in Rao et al., (2005) [23], Rao et al., (2006) [22] and Duraes et al., (2012) [6], which gives flexible, ultra-lightweight aerogels.\n2 Fundamentals\nSome of the surfactants used in this work were also used in works of Table 2.8, such as the CTAB and Pluronic F127. However, there was no report until now where the surfactant SDS was tested in similar synthesis conditions. Moreover, one main goal of this work was to elaborate a comparative study (using the same synthesis method) between three major types of surfactants, a cationic (CTAB), an anionic (SDS) and a nonionic (Pluronic F127), and shed light onto the different interactions these can have with the silica species during gelation. In this way, it will be possible to define which type of surfactants will be preferred to tailor the structure and properties of the MTMS-derived aerogels. Such a study was never performed up to our knowledge.\n2.5\tComputational work\nThis thesis includes a molecular dynamics study on the interactions between the silica gel's structural units and surfactants. It was then essential to define what was needed to model the formation of a silica gel, the surfactant molecules and the conformations to be used. In the studied system, the gel system is composed by the solvent methanol, the precursor MTMS and a cationic or anionic surfactant (CTAB and SDS respectively) and, as such, their force fields (see below) were required.\nSome assumptions are needed for the modeling of such system, namely:\n\u2022\tthe temperature and pressure of the simulation;\n\u2022\tthe pH level (changed by the addition of OH- or H+);\n\u2022\tonly the precursor forms clusters;\n\u2022\tthe type of structures created in the beginning of condensation of the precursor;\n\u2022\tthe force fields to be used;\n\u2022\tsimulation time.\nTo make clear this part of the work, a brief explanation on the meaning of computational chemistry, molecular modeling/simulation and molecular dynamics will be given below.\nComputational chemistry and molecular modeling\nBroadly speaking, computational chemistry (CC) is the field of chemistry that uses mathematical models and computational methods for the calculation of molecular properties and/or molecular behavior [241. Nowadays, many research studies are being done in order to simulate and predict how certain systems evolve. This approach allows to minimize the waste of material and human resources doing experimental work, making CC the fastest, cheapest and the best way to test and explore more options in the developing of new molecules [24].\nCC simulations can be done by several different more or less demanding methods, like ab initio, density functional theory (DFT) and semi-empirical, but the simplest and least time consuming are those based on molecular mechanics (MM). MM avoids the remarkable\n2 Fundamentals complexity of quantum mechanics methods and algorithms thereof. It uses a much simpler mathematical and computing framework, thus allowing to model and simulate the behavior of even extremely large molecules, like proteins, because less computational resources are required.\nBefore explaining the basic theory behind MM, the concept of energy used therein, which is one of the most important concepts in CC, is presented. The energy of a molecular system is dependent on its kinetic and potential energies that derive from the vibrational, rotational, translational, electronical and nuclear energies and also by the Coulomb law [24]. The total energy of the system is represented by the Hamiltonian operator.\nAll the methods in CC define the most stable system as the one that has the lowest energy level. Thus, when analyzing the system's energy, the ability of a molecular process to occur can be anticipated [24].\nWhen using MM, the total energy of the molecules in study is given by a simple algebraic equation holding constants obtained by either spectroscopy data or ab initio calculations. The set of these equations with their corresponding constants or parameters is called a force field (FF), whose performance is dependent on several factors, namely [241:\n\u2022\tthe functional form of the energy expression;\n\u2022\tthe data used to parameterize the FF;\n\u2022\tthe technique used to optimize constants from that data;\n\u2022\tthe ability of the user to apply the technique in a way consistent with its strengths and weaknesses.\nThe FF equations describe various aspects of the molecule, such as: bond stretching and bending, torsions, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding [24].\nMost of the energies used in MM are conformational energies, which means that the computed energies try to reliably predict the energy differences between different conformations. It should also be noted that each conformation has a FF and due to the existence of many FF developed by third parties, researchers rarely have the need to parameterize FF, meaning that existing ones can be used [24].\nMolecular dynamics\nMolecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method in which atoms and molecules are treated as moving particles, under the influence of classical mechanic FF. This method, firstly developed in the 1950s, is a powerful tool in engineering and science and is used to understand the behavior of fluids and materials at the atomistic level. With MD, it is also possible to directly evaluate physical properties of interest. Regarding chemical engineering applications, several simulations can be made, namely [25]:\n\u2022\torganic mixtures;\n\u2022\tdiffusion in nanoporous materials;\n2 Fundamentals\n\u2022\tmolten salts and room temperature ionic liquids;\n\u2022\tphysical properties (FF, vapor pressure and vapor-liquid equilibria, liquid density, selfdiffusivity, viscosity, polymer properties such as glass transition temperature and gas penetrant permeation).\nForce fields in molecular dynamics\nMD treats atoms as classical particles. Since the Hamiltonian of the system only depends on the position and momentum of the collection of atoms, the energetic interactions between atoms are well modeled using FF P51, i.e. the potential energy of the molecular system is described in a FF. MD uses empirical FF that are only dependent on the position of atoms. These empirical FF are approximations because the parameters are obtained experimentally or by ab initio calculations.\nAs all simulations are done with the defined parameters in the FF, the results must be cautiously analyzed because, if the FF are poorly described, the results will not yield practical significance. In this case, the FF will have to be recalculated.\nMD solves the Newton equations of motion for a system with N atomic interactions by describing the potential energy of the system. That is done by summing various atomic contributions such as: the bonding interactions, including bond stretching, angular variations and bond twisting, and the nonbonding terms, such as the electrostatic and the van der Waals interactions. Thus it is utmost important to have these parameters well defined because they compose the FF of a molecule that is then used in the molecular dynamics of a system.\nBoundary conditions\nThe simulation is done within a simulation box. However, this box does not have boundaries to prevent boundary effects. This \"box without boundaries\" is achieved by using the concept of periodic boundary conditions which consists in an array of identical copies, in all directions, of the simulation box. With this concept, every time a particle leaves the box with a set momentum another identical appears on the opposite side of the box, thus preserving the mass, number of particles and the total energy in the simulation box. This model makes an accurate approximation to an infinite box P61.\n2.5.1\tGROMACS\nGROMACS stands for GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations and was designed in the University of Groningen, Netherlands, as a package to perform molecular dynamic simulations and energy minimizations [27]. It was primarily designed for molecules that have complicated bond interactions, such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, but due to GROMACS ability to calculate the nonbonded interactions extremely fast, it is also possible to use it for research on non-biological systems like the one presented in this thesis [28].\nIn this thesis, GROMACS is used as a computational tool, for which some basic knowledge is required in order to use it effectively. Since the used FF were obtained from the Automated Topology Builder (ATB) and Repository P9J, a treatment before the calculations is required so that the FF from ATB can be computed by GROMACS. Following the treatment, the simulation box is built and then an energy minimization is carried out, at the desired temperature and pressure, to relax the system before performing the trajectory calculations. Figure 2.5 presents a typical flowchart illustrating the different steps used in this thesis.\nFigure 2.5 - Flowchart for a typical GROMACS MD run of this thesis (adapted from GROMACS - flow chart i30!)\nResults analysis\nThere are several possibilities to analyze the obtained MD results. The first and fastest one is to load the trajectories file (traj.xtc), from the simulation, into a program like Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD), and actually visualize the evolution of the simulation. Nevertheless, this corresponds just to a qualitative assessment of the system, and a more quantitative approach is required. Other possibilities to analyze the data produced in this thesis are to use the command hbond, which computes and analyzes hydrogen bonds between molecules, or the command clustsize that is able to compute the size distributions of molecular/atomic clusters I31!!32!. The hbond is used whenever hydrogen bonds are possible to\n2 Fundamentals\noccur between the precursor particles and the clustsize is used in all results due to the natural aggregation of the particles.\n2.5.2\tMTMS-derived aerogel structures\nIn sol-gel condensation reactions, MTMS-hydrolyzed species react with one another and form clusters that can be dimmers, trimmers and so on. However, to this date, not many works have been developed that contemplate the possible structures MTMS forms when condensation is occurring t33!. Benvenutti et al. (2009) t34! have reported that silsesquioxanes2 can form three different structures: random, a bidimensional structure that can create a layer arrangement or a ladder shape, and a tridimensional arrangement in cage shape. Kanamori et al. (2014) [35] stated that the structures can be random, a perfect cage or a partial cage, but none of these works investigate the most likely structure that a MTMS precursor forms, they just present a generic assessment.\nThankfully, a very recent study, presented in Table 2.10, sheds some light into the most likely conformation for MTMS clusters.\nTable 2.10 - Article from literature with interest for the present work, presenting the most likely cluster conformation formed by MTMS [33].\nArticle Chemical System\nComputational Details\nRelevant Conclusions\nBorba et al., 2016\nMTMS based aerogels\n\u2022Approach based on an integrated vibrational frequency prediction within the DFT/B3LYP framework and experimental counterpart;\n\u2022A total of thirteen different structures were studied by quantum chemical calculations;\n\u2022Constricted to a maximum of eight Si atoms due to computational constraints;\n\u2022Harmonic frequency calculations were done to ensure the computed structures corresponded to the minimum on potential energy.\n\u2022Theoretical results suggest that cyclic and/or polycyclic structures are more probable than linear ones, meaning that a caged structure is more probable;\n\u2022Was established a tentative relationship between FTIR spectra and microstructural properties;\n\u2022The experimental data confirmed the theoretical predictions. (in condensation, linear and cyclic are the dominant structures and after gel point branched and cyclic are the dominant ones).\nThe structures that were selected for the model used in this work were proposed by Borba et al. (2016) t33! as the most probable MTMS-derived structures formed in the early stages of condensation. They are presented in Figure 2.6.\n2 Silsesquioxanes - Hybrid inorganic-organic structures with the chemical formula [RSiO3/2]n, being R an organic group.\na) Cyclic structure with 4 silicon atoms\nb) Cage with 8 silicon atoms\nFigure 2.6 - MTMS-derived structures used in this thesis.\nThese two structures can be compared between them because one is a complete cage and the other, in simple terms, is half of it. For the sake of simplicity, throughout this thesis, the cyclic structure will be named SI4 and the cage structures as SI8. These will be generically designated by \"particles\".\nThis chapter is divided into three sections. The first section presents a description of the used chemicals, the synthesis of gels with and without surfactant, the drying of the gel and a summary of the synthesized materials. The second section gives details about the characterization of the materials. The third section describes the materials, the computational tools and conditions, the simulation box and a summary of the simulations made and the tools used for results analysis.\n3.1\tSynthesis of aerogels\n3.1.1\tMaterials\nThe materials in this work where obtained with the precursor methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS, CH3Si(OCH3)3, \u00ab 98%), the catalysts oxalic acid (C2H2O4, > 99%) and ammonium hydroxide ( NH4OH, 25% NH3 in H2O), methanol (CH3OH, >99.8%) as solvent and the surfactants hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, CH3(CH2)15N(Br)(CH3)3, > 99%),\nsodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, CH3(CH2)11OSO3Na, > 99%) and Pluronic F127\n(F127, H(OCH2CH2)x(OCH2CHCH3)y(OCH2CH2)zOH, Mn \u00ab 12600 Da).\nAll of these were\nsupplied by Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification, and the high purity water\nwas obtained in the Direct Pure Water System of Rephile Bioscience. The chemical structure of\nthese surfactants is presented in Figure 3.1.\n9Ha Br\t9 Na+\tCHs\nH3C(H2C)i5-N+-CH3\tCH3(CH2)ioCH20-S-0- H(OCH2CH2)x(OCH2CH)y(OCH2CH2)zOH\nCHs\tO\nCTAB\tSDS\tPluronic F127\nFigure 3.1 - Chemical structures of the surfactants used in this work.\n3.1.2\tSynthesis of gels with and without surfactant\nThe synthesis of the MTMS-derived gels, followed a two-step acid-base process similar to the one presented in Duraes et al.,(2012) [6]. The calculations to define the reagents amounts and ratios for the gel are similar to those presented by Meneses (2014) t36].\n3 Experimental and computational details\nAll the synthesis were performed with the molar ratios of 1:35:4:4 for MTMS:methanol:acidic water:alkaline water and an amount of surfactant ranging from no surfactant to 1.500 g. The procedure starts with the hydrolysis of MTMS, promoted with the acid catalyst, in a solution of methanol, MTMS, surfactant and acidic water (0.01 M of oxalic acid). This solution is stirred for 30 minutes in a water bath at 27\u00b0C. Then the solution is kept inside an oven for 24 hours at 27\u00b0C in order to promote the hydrolysis reaction. After this time, the alkaline catalyst (10 M of ammonium hydroxide) is slowly added to the solution to promote the condensation and the subsequent step of gelation. Afterwards, the solution is placed in an oven at 27\u00b0C for a period of 48 hours in which gelation occurs and then the gel is aged.\n3.1.3\tDrying of the gels\nAfter gel aging, the gels were dried using a supercritical fluid drying approach, where CO2 was used in order to obtain aerogels.\nThe supercritical drying with CO2 is performed in two consecutive steps. In the first step, the gel is washed with a solvent, in this case methanol. It drags the chemicals insoluble in supercritical CO2, mostly the ammonium hydroxide and water. In the second step, supercritical CO2 is forced to pass through the sample in order to dissolve and drag the methanol, leaving behind the dried silica skeleton that forms the aerogel. The conditions used for this drying method are listed in Table 3.1.\nTable 3.1 - Conditions used for supercritical drying with CO2 [7].\n\tPressure (bar)\tFlow rate (mL.min-1)\tRun time (minutes)\tCell temperature (\u00b0C)\nMeOH\t120\t2\t60\t50\nCO2\t\u00ab150\t3\t90\t50\n3.1.4\tSummary of the synthesized materials\nThis work started using an ambient pressure drying (APD) approach and, as such, producing xerogels. However, as can be seen in Appendix A, the results were not good due to the difficulty of removing the surfactant. Thus, the APD route was abandoned.\nThe nomenclature of the materials synthesized is done according Table 3.2 where the letter A stands for MTMS aerogel.\n3 Experimental and computational details\nTable 3.2 - Nomenclature of the aerogels synthesized with various surfactants and surfactant's amounts.\nSample\tReplicas\tSurfactant\tSurfactant amount (g)\nA\tLPC-0.0; LPC-0.1; LPC-0.2; LPC-0.3\tWithout surfactant\t---\nA_CTAB_0.50\tLPC-010; LPC-011; LPC-012; LPC-013\t\t0.50\nA_CTAB_0.75\tLPC-003; LPC-004; LPC-005; LPC-009\t\t0.75\nA_CTAB_1.00\tLPC-000; LPC-001; LPC-002\tCTAB\t1.00\nA_CTAB_1.25\tLPC-006; LPC-007; LPC-008\t\t1.25\n\tLPC-014; LPC-015;\t\t\nA_CTAB_1.50\tLPC-016; LPC-017;\t\t1.50\n\tLPC-018\t\t\n\tLPC-019; LPC-020;\t\t\nA_F127_0.50\tLPC-024; LPC-025;\t\t0.50\n\tLPC-034\t\t\nA_F127_0.75\tLPC-030; LPC-031; LPC-032; LPC-035\t\t0.75\nA_F127_1.00\tLPC-026; LPC-028; LPC-029; LPC-036\tPluronic F-127\t1.00\nA_F127_1.25\tLPC-037; LPC-040; LPC-042; LPC-052\t\t1.25\n\tLPC-041; LPC-043;\t\t\nA_F127_1.50\tLPC-045; LPC-050;\t\t1.50\n\tLPC-053\t\t\nA_SDS_0.50\tLPC-039; LPC-044; LPC-046; LPC-054\t\t0.50\nA_SDS_0.75\tLPC-047; LPC-048; LPC-051; LPC-055\tSDS\t0.75\n3.2\tCharacterization of the synthesized materials\nAfter the synthesis of aerogels, their chemical, physical and mechanical characterization was performed. The techniques here described were chosen.\n3.2.1\tChemical characterization\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)\nFTIR allows to assess the chemical structure of the aerogels by identifying the chemical bonds whose vibrations occur in the infrared range. The infrared radiation is not energetic enough for electronic transitions to occur and as such the radiation absorbed causes the\n3 Experimental and computational details chemical bonds to vibrate more intensely. The absorption occurs when the chemical bond has a dipole moment and interacts with incident infrared radiation. The frequency at which a chemical bond vibrates is unique since it depends on the mass of the atoms and the strength of the bonds involved t37]. Thus, the FTIR spectrum obtained for a sample is a \"fingerprint\" of the chemical structure under analysis.\nThe FTIR analysis of aerogels was performed in a Jasco FT/IR 4200 equipment, in the midinfrared region, in particular between 4000 and 400 cm-1, with a resolution of 4 cm-1.\nIn order to analyze the aerogels, pellets were prepared with 78.5 to 80 mg of KBr and 0.20 to 0.30 mg of the material. The pellet was then put inside de spectrometer and a beam of light, in the infrared region, hits the pellet generating a transmission spectrum as a function of wavenumber. This characterization was carried out for each dried sample.\nElemental analysis\nThe elemental analysis main goal was to determine quantitatively the mass fraction of some chemical elements, specifically C, H, N, S in the aerogel samples. This was determined using the EA 1108 CHNS-O from Fision Instruments.\nFor the determination of the referred elements, the sample was subjected to a flash combustion at 900\u00b0C using a flow of He enriched with oxygen. The resulting combustion gases (CO2, H2O, N2 and SO2) are separated with a chromatographic column and quantified by a thermal conductivity detector that emits a signal proportional to the concentration of the individual components of the sample. The aerogel samples were prepared by mixing replicas of each type of aerogel and grinding them to a fine dust like powder, in order to have a representative sample for the selected aerogels. The aerogels chosen for this analysis were: A, A_CTAB_1.25, A_CTAB_1.50, A_F127_1.25, A_F127_1.50 and A_SDS_0.75. These include the aerogel without surfactant and the ones that presented the best results in terms of bulk density.\nContact angle\nContact angles (0c) may give information about the interactions between solid surfaces and liquids, in this case the aerogel and water, and in this way assess if the materials are hydrophobic or not. Silica aerogels are often hydrophobized as they tend to degrade upon exposure to moisture (hydrolysis reactions), thus the measuring of the contact angle is of major importance.\n\u25a0\u25baWater drop\n\u25ba Aerogel\nFigure 3.2 - Representation of contact angles above 90\u00b0.\nThe main interactions acting in the system are the cohesive forces between the water molecules and the adhesive forces between the water molecules and the solid surface. When the contact angle is lower than 90\u00b0 it means that there is an affinity between the liquid and the solid, and the liquid wets the surface which means the material is hydrophilic. However, when the contact angle is higher than 90\u00b0, little affinity between the water molecules and the solid surface exists and the cohesive forces prevail, being the material hydrophobic.\nThe measurement of 0c was done with OCA 20 equipment, from DataPhysics, and all the synthesized samples had their contact angles evaluated. For each sample 8 to 10 measurements were done in order to have a representative average contact angle.\nZeta potential\nZeta potential is a parameter indirectly determined by the surface charge of solid particles in a colloidal dispersion [38]. It indirectly measures the net electrical charge created in the particles in a suspension, either by adsorption of counter ions or dissociation of surface groups from the particles. The higher absolute values of zeta potential the more stable is the suspension, since the charged particles repel each other which overcomes the tendency to form the aggregates caused by the Van der Waals forces [39].\nThis technique is used to quantify the charge of the surface of silica particles obtained from the aerogel without surfactant. Experimentally, 0.55 mg of the aerogel sample were ground and dispersed in 2 mL of methanol using an ultrasound bath. Then, this suspension was inserted with a syringe in the sample cell of the Zetasizer, from Malvern Instruments, and the measurement was run. Only sample A was measured but the measurements were replicated five times.\n3.2.2\tPhysical/Structural characterization\nBulk density\nBulk density (pb) is the ratio between the mass and the volume of a sample and is obtained by taking into account the total volume of the material including the pore volume.\n3 Experimental and computational details This is an important characteristic to evaluate in aerogels, since there is a relation between this property and the extent of porosity and, thus, their thermal conductivity.\nTo measure this property, the samples were cut in a cuboid shape, weighed in a high precision scale and measured with a micrometer. The obtained values for each sample were then calculated according to the Equation 3.1.\nm\tn\n(3J)\nAll samples were characterized and 4 separate measurements for each replica were made in order to achieve an average value.\nHelium pycnometry\nHelium pycnometry allows to determine a good approximation to the real volume of the solid material and its global porosity. It uses an inert gas with small molecule size, in this case helium, which fills all the pores of the material. A small portion of a sample is ground to a fine powder and then is put in a chamber where helium is injected until it occupies all the free space. The pressure is measured in the same chamber. Then, by opening a valve that connects this chamber to a secondary chamber, the helium expands to the latter and the pressure at equilibrium is again measured. Thus, by considering the pressure difference it is possible to calculate the volume of the solid matrix - skeletal density i40].\nThe equipment used to measure this property was an Accupyc 1330 from Micrometrics and the analyzed samples were A, A_CTAB_1.25, A_F127_1.25 and A_SDS_0.75.\nBy using the bulk and skeletal densities it is possible to estimate the porosity of the material with Equation 3.2.\n(3.2)\nScanning electron microscope (SEM)\nSEM is a technique that provides information on the morphology, size and appearance of the structural units in the material by generating images of the materials surface.\nThis technique is performed while scanning the sample's surface, under vacuum, with a focused electron beam. The beam interacts with the atoms in the sample, originating the emission of secondary electrons, backscattered electrons and also the emission of characteristic x-rays. With the detection of the secondary electrons (atom's outer shell electrons), the equipment can generate images of the sample's surface features. On the other hand, with the detection of the backscattered electrons (elastically scattered primary electrons from the beam) and the characteristic x-rays, it is possible to obtain chemical information about the sample. For the detection of the characteristic x-rays the microscope needs an Energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer detector (EDS). The x-rays generated in the sample are resultant from the relaxation of excited electron states generated by inelastic interaction of the beam with inner-shell electrons of the sample's atoms. As the silica aerogels are not electrically conductive, it is\n3 Experimental and computational details necessary to coat the sample with a thin layer of gold, so that the electrons from the beam do not accumulate on the sample and hinder the observation. This is done by physical vapor deposition (PVD) during 15 s.\nThe observed samples were A, A_CTAB_0.75, A_CTAB_1.25, A_CTAB_1.50, A_F127_0.75, A_F127_1.25, A_F127_1.50 and A_SDS_0.75 which were put inside a ZEISS MERLIN Compact/VPCompact, Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), over a metallic sample holder.\nAccelerated surface area and porosimetry (ASAP)\nThe ASAP technique was used to obtain the specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the best aerogels. It uses gas sorption with N2 in order to determine the surface area but it can also give, indirectly, the pore size distribution. The sorption can be a physical process, in which the adsorbate molecules interact with the adsorbent by Van der Waals forces, or a chemical one, where the molecules bond to the surface of the adsorbent, with covalent or ionic bonding. This technique is based on the increase of N2 pressure inside a chamber with the sample, starting from very low relative pressure (P/Po &lt;0.05; Po \u2014 Saturation pressure), enabling the sorption of the test gas molecules onto the solid surface of the sample and allowing to measure the equilibrium pressure at which all surface is covered with a single layer of gas molecules (monolayer). By knowing the amount of gas sorbed in the monolayer and the mean surface area of each gas molecule, with the application of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory, it is possible to calculate the surface area of the material. The pore size distribution of the sample is determined using the algorithm of Barret, Joyner, Halenda (BJH) by the application of the Kelvin and the Halsey equations t41!.\nAll samples were previously degassed during three days at 50\u00b0C, in a vacuum oven, and also degassed in the equipment at 80\u00b0C until pressure stabilization. The equipment used to evaluate the surface area and pore size distribution of aerogels was an ASAP 2000, from Micromeritics, and the samples tested were A, A_CTAB_1.25, A_F127_1.25 and A_SDS_0.75.\n3.2.3\tMechanical characterization\nCompression test\nThe uniaxial compression test was used to determine the Young's modulus of the synthesized aerogels when the test sample is subjected to an external uniaxial compression force.\nMaterials may suffer strain of two types. One is when the material has the capability of recovering its initial shape, called elastic strain, and the other is when the material is not able to recover its initial shape, being permanently deformed, which is named plastic strain.\n3 Experimental and computational details\nThe Young's modulus is determined through Equation 3.3, where o stands for the stress and \u00a3 is the strain. This equation is obtained from the Hooke's Law, which states that stress is linearly proportional to the strain, when the specimen is under elastic deformation. The proportionally constant is the Young's modulus and corresponds to the slope of the stressstrain curve in the elastic region (initial linear part of the curve).\nYoung's modulus (E) = \u00b0/E\t(3.3)\nThe compression tests were performed on a Shimadzu Autograph AG-X machine and only one replica of each sample was tested. The tested replicas belonged to samples A, A_CTAB_1.25, A_F127_1.25 and A_SDS_0.75. The tests were conducted up to 50% strain of the test sample with a deformation rate of 10 mm.min-1. It is worth mentioning that all samples recovered completely their original size after the test.\n3.3\tComputer simulation of the aerogels structure\n3.3.1\tMaterials\nThe primary structures of the MTMS-derived species used in the simulations were the SI4 and SI8 particles that were presented in the subsection 2.5.2. The remaining components used in the simulations were the solvent molecule, methanol, and the surfactant CTAB.\nIn order to have a representative sample, several quantities of the MTMS-derived particles SI4 and SI8 were simulated. For the surfactant, the smallest quantity experimentally tested and the quantity considered as optimal for achieving the lower bulk density were simulated, in order to analyze the possible differences resulting from the addition of surfactant.\nThe FF of these species, as explained in section 2.5, were obtained through the ATB database.\n3.3.2\tComputational tools\nThis thesis uses the Ubuntu operating system (OS) with the GROMACS package in order to run molecular dynamics on a system composed of MTMS-derived particles, methanol and surfactants. The Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) allows the visualization of the simulation boxes and the creation of movies. The Grace is a free graph plotting tool of the Ubuntu OS and was used for plotting the results obtained with the clustsize and hbond commands.\n3.3.3\tComputational conditions\nThe computer simulations were conducted at the same ambient P-T conditions of gelation, however the pH was considered 7 and, as such, different from the condition used in the laboratory for condensation, where the pH is normally in the range of 10-12. The main reason for this difference was that the change in pH introduces a new variable, which can only be tuned by adding of new ionic species, turning the system more complex and requiring more computation time. For the present work the pH variable is not as important as the assessment of the effect of different surfactants in the clustering process of the system.\n3.3.4\tSimulation box\nAll simulations started by generating the molecules topology files. The building of the simulation box begins with the creation of a box with 10 nm3 and then by randomly adding the species by the order shown in Figure 3.3.\nMTMS-derived particles\nSI4 or SI8\nSurfactant\n(CTAB)\nSolvent\n(methanol)\nA\nFigure 3.3 - Flow diagram of the species added into the simulation box.\nThe reason for this order is related with the components amounts/molar ratios. Both in the laboratorial and computational work, the number of methanol molecules inserted in the box was much larger than the number of MTMS-derived particles or surfactant molecules, making easier to add them at the end. A different order could, however, be used and it probably would not have much effect on the final result. For a better understanding on the molar ratios and how much particles are involved in the simulation see Appendix B.\nOnce all the basic particles required to perform the simulation are inserted into the box, an energy minimization is performed. This is done to relax the system and for not blowing it up, because one molecule would shoot away due to an accumulation of potential energy and momentum, as soon as the calculation of trajectories would start.\n3 Experimental and computational details\n3.3.5\tSummary of the simulations made\nThe nomenclature of the simulations performed in this work is presented in Table 3.3.\nTable 3.3 - Summary of the simulations made.\t\t\t\t\nSimulation\tMTMS-derived particle\tNumber of MTMS-derived particles\tSurfactant\tSurfactant quantity (g)\nB1\t\t90\t\t\nB2\t\t80\t---\t---\nB3\t\t70\t\t\nB1 CTAB0.50\t\t90\t\t\nB2 CTAB0.50\tSI4\t80\t\t0.50\nB3 CTAB0.50\t\t70\tCTAB\t\nB1 CTAB1.25\t\t90\t\t\nB2 CTAB1.25\t\t80\t\t1.25\nB3 CTAB1.25\t\t70\t\t\nC1\t\t45\t\t\nC2\t\t40\t---\t---\nC3\t\t35\t\t\nC1 CTAB0.50\t\t45\t\t\nC2 CTAB0.50\tSI8\t40\t\t0.50\nC3 CTAB0.50\t\t35\tCTAB\t\nC1 CTAB1.25\t\t45\t\t\nC2 CTAB1.25\t\t40\t\t1.25\nC3 CTAB1.25\t\t35\t\t\n3.3.6\tTools for results analysis\nVMD\nVisual molecular dynamics or VMD is the tool used to visualize the simulation box and the computed trajectories. In simple terms, this is done by writing the following command \"vmd (insert name of the simulation).gro\". To see the trajectories it is required to use the output .xtc that holds the trajectories of each individual molecule.\nThis tool was used to visualize all the computed systems.\nhbond\nThe hbond command in GROMACS computes and analyzes hydrogen bonds [31]. More specifically, it computes the donor and acceptor of hydrogens (OH and O, respectively). This was applied only to the systems containing SI4 particles because these have donors of hydrogens while the SI8 particles do not. Thus, with this command the goal was to see if the\n3 Experimental and computational details MTMS precursor has a tendency to aggregate into cage-like structures through hydrogen bonding.\nIn order to calculate the number of hydrogen bonds an index file was used (the same as in the clustsize command) but this time the command was \"gmx hbond (insert name of the simulation) .xtc\".\nclustsize\nThe clustsize command provided by the GROMACS package computes the size distributions of molecular clusters t32!, meaning that, in this case, it computes the aggregates of SI4 or SI8 particles. This is done using an index file where the several molecules are discriminated and, then, by typing \"gmx clustsize (insert name of the simulation).xtc\" on the command line of the console.\nThis command was used in all the simulated systems.\n4 Results and discussion\n4.1\tSamples and laboratory observations\nTable 4.1 presents a photo, the observable results and the bulk density of the different synthesized samples.\nTable 4.1 - Pictures, observable characteristics and bulk density of the synthesized aerogels.\nSample\nPhoto\nObservations\nPb (kg.m-3)\nA\nComplete gelation.

The samples obtained when using the chosen synthesis method are all opaque. Some laboratory observations made alongside the bulk density characterization of the obtained materials were considered to determine when the amount of a particular surfactant was still advantageous. The samples' dryability was an immediate reference point to whether it was worth continuing to add surfactant in the synthesis process or not. In addition, the apparent flexibility of the material also had an impact when choosing the most promising samples.\nAt a first visualization, the best samples would be A_CTAB_1.25, A_CTAB_1.50, A_F127_1.00, A_F127_1.25 and both samples with SDS. As these were very flexible, exhibited good monolicity and featured very little particle shedding. However, this analysis by itself is insufficient to validate this selection.\nIn order to get a better understanding of the samples selection, the average results for the bulk density, with the respective confidence interval at 95%, can be seen in Figure 4.1 with some brief comments afterwards.\n70,00\n65,00\n60,00\nCO\n55,00 bC\n50,00\n45,00\n40,00\n35,00\n30,00\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\" \u00b1 :\t\t\t\n\tL j,\t2\t\t\u2018\t1 '\tT\n\t\t\t[\tI\n\t\t\t\n\u2022 Without surfactant 1 1\t\u2666 CTAB\t* F127\t\u25a0 SDS 1\n1,250\t1,500\t1,750\n0,000\t0,250\t0,500\t0,750\t1,000\nSurfactant mass (g)\nFigure 4.1 - Average bulk density for the synthesized materials with and without surfactant.\nOverall, for each surfactant a minimum bulk density was achieved. For the CTAB and F127 this minimum was when 1.250 g were added and for the SDS the minimum was observed at 0.750 g. These minima were considered in the selection of the best samples, since the lower is the bulk density the better are the materials for thermal insulation, according to the known expression k a p1,5 i42]. For SDS samples, the obtained values tend to decrease with the increasing mass of surfactant. Thus, the minimum bulk density was considered for the last value. In this case, higher amounts of surfactant led to non-dried samples. Thus the best samples were A_CTAB_1.25, A_F127_1.25 and A_SDS_0.75. In addition, sample A was also selected for comparison and, in some cases, samples A_CTAB_1.50 and A_F127_1.50 were also analyzed as the extreme cases of surfactant amount. Nevertheless, for some more accessible analysis techniques, all the synthesized samples were assessed.\n4.2\tChemical characterization of the aerogels\n4.2.1\tFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)\nIn order to analyze the chemical structure of the different samples, the infrared spectroscopy was used, as referred in the previous chapter. The FTIR results are presented in three figures (Figures 4.2-4.4), one for each surfactant (consult Appendix C for more information). The results will be briefly discussed as they are presented and afterwards a summary regarding the FTIR analysis is made.\n4 Results and discussion\nWavenumber (cm-1)\nFigure 4.2 - FTIR spectra of the pure MTMS-derived aerogel and the MTMS-derived aerogels with the cationic surfactant, CTAB (v-stretching vibrations, vs-symmetric stretching vibration, vas-antisymmetric stretching vibration, vp-in-plane stretching vibration, b-deformation vibration, bs-symmetric deformation vibration (bending), bas-antisymmetric deformation vibration (bending)).\nThrough the observation of Figure 4.2, it is possible to verify that all the samples have similar spectra, thus a similar chemical structure. The first peak, visible at 421 cm'1, corresponds to the deformation vibration of the O-Si-O bond. The peaks of the Si-O bonds also appear at 549, 676 and 771 cm-1, which correspond to the symmetric stretching vibrations, and at 920 cm-1, which is the in-plane stretching vibration. At wavenumbers of 1000-1100 cm-1, the antisymmetric stretching vibrations of the Si-O-Si bonds are evident I37!!43!.\nThe presence of a peak at 835 cm-1 is indicative of the existence of the methyl functional groups linked to Si, representing the stretching vibrations of Si-C bonds.\nThe peaks visible between 2850-2970 cm-1 represent the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of C-H bonds. The presence of these is indicative of the hydrophobicity of the material, because they are characteristic of the -CH3 groups from the MTMS precursor.\n4 Results and discussion The peaks at 1270 cm-1 and at 1400-1460 cm-1 indicate the symmetric and antisymmetric deformation vibrations of the C-H bonds for the -CH3 and Si-CH3 groups.\nIn one of the samples (A_CTAB_1.50), it is also possible to identify the presence of a probable contamination, giving an indication of C=O bonds that should not be in this system.\nBy the observation of Figure 4.2, the similarity of the FTIR spectra for all the samples shows not only that a silica structure is formed in all of them but that there is also no surfactant present in the final structure because no discernible characteristic bands of tertiary amines (corresponds to C-N bonds) are present in the spectra (namely bands at 1000-1250 cm-1). This may be due to the presence of strong peaks for other structural units in the same region, but since the overlapping of peaks usually results in shoulders in the spectra it is safe to assume that no surfactant seems to be present.\nFigure 4.3 - FTIR spectra of the pure MTMS-derived aerogel and the MTMS-derived aerogels with the nonionic surfactant, F127 (v-stretching vibrations, vs-symmetric stretching vibration, vas-antisymmetric stretching vibration, vp-in-plane stretching vibration, 6-deformation vibration, 6s-symmetric deformation vibration (bending), 6as-antisymmetric deformation vibration (bending)).\n4 Results and discussion\nIn Figure 4.3, the same bonds are seen as in Figure 4.2, leading to the previously stated conclusions. There also seems to be a small peak (corresponding to the C=O bond) in the sample A_F127_0.50 which could be a contamination.\nIt is also possible to see that the spectra are all similar between them, but the location of the possible peaks that could indicate the presence of F127 in the dried structure coincide with the bonds that correspond to the CH3 groups present in the pure sample A, thus it is not possible to ascertain with 100% confidence that no F127 remained in dried structure.\nWavenumber (cm-1)\nFigure 4.4 - FTIR spectra of the pure MTMS-derived aerogel and the MTMS-derived aerogels with the anionic surfactant, SDS (v-stretching vibrations, vs-symmetric stretching vibration, vas-antisymmetric stretching vibration, vp-in-plane stretching vibration, b-deformation vibration, bs-symmetric deformation vibration (bending), bas-antisymmetric deformation vibration (bending)).\nBy observing Figure 4.4, there is no peak that could possibly indicate the presence of contaminants, the spectra are similar as in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. In addition, there is no obvious trace of the SDS surfactant. This may be because the peak that indicates the presence of SO4- is near 1100 cm'1 which coincides with the major peaks corresponding to the Si-O-Si bond. Moreover, the zone of C-H bonds does not have significant changes, thus making impossible to identify its presence solely through this characterization.\nIt is worth mentioning that the base line for each spectrum is not equally leveled in order to comment the size difference in the peaks of the spectrums and relate it to the samples' amount.\nWhen taking into account the three previous figures, it is not possible to detect the presence of surfactant in the dried structure, the spectra being all quite similar in terms of the visible characteristic peaks. Thus, the used surfactants were well removed from the aerogels structure in the drying stage with supercritical CO2. Also, since all spectra do not present a\n4 Results and discussion peak and/or deviation indicating the presence of ammonia, it seems that base catalyst residuals are not present, meaning that the samples were well dried.\n4.2.2\tElemental analysis\nThis analysis was made in order to determine quantitatively the mass fraction of nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) in the samples. The discussion of these results is organized in two separate steps. In the first one, a brief comment on the obtained results is presented and, in the second, a comparison with the theoretical expected results for complete and incomplete gelation is made.\nThe results obtained for the elected samples are found in Table 4.2.\nTable 4.2 - Experimental mass percentages of CHNS obtained for the selected aerogel samples.\nSample\t% C (w/w)\t% H (w/w)\t% N (w/w)\t% S (w/w)\t% Si + % O (w/w)\nA\t18.912\t4.675\t&lt;100 ppm\t&lt;100 ppm\t76.413\nA_CTAB_1.25\t18.580\t4.924\t&lt;100 ppm\t&lt;100 ppm\t76.496\nA CTAB 1.50\t20.280\t5.020\t0.100\t&lt;100 ppm\t74.600\nA_F127_1.25\t20.156\t5.272\t&lt;100 ppm\t&lt;100 ppm\t74.572\nA F127 1.50\t21.614\t5.405\t&lt;100 ppm\t&lt;100 ppm\t72.981\nA SDS 0.75\t18.549\t4.628\t0.020\t&lt;100 ppm\t76.803\nThrough Table 4.2 it can be seen that no sulfur is present in the tested samples, not even in the A_SDS_0.75 aerogel. In fact, in the studied system, sulfur is only present in the SDS molecule but it does not show in the aerogel sample synthesized with this surfactant, proving that the surfactant was effectively removed by scCO2, as already observed in the FTIR results discussion. Nitrogen is present in the samples A_CTAB_1.50 and A_SDS_0.75, which is consistent with the fact that the corresponding gels were very hard to dry. The presence of non-negligible amount of the alkaline catalyst in these gels is due to the hydrogen bonding of ammonium hydroxide with the heads of these surfactants. The residual ammonium hydroxide will retain water in the gel structure, making the gels hard to dry because water is not soluble in supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Moreover, the aerogel A_CTAB_1.50 may also have retained some residual CTAB (due to the higher amount of added), which also has N in its constitution. However, the presence of nitrogen in these samples was not perceptible in the respective FTIR spectra, probably because of the overlapping of vibration bands.\nBy analyzing the results of the samples with CTAB and F127, in Table 4.2, the percentages of C and H increase with increasing amounts of surfactant. When comparing these samples with sample A (without surfactant), it is also noticeable that, in general, the C and H\n4 Results and discussion percentages are higher. This observation indicates that some residual surfactant may have not been removed during drying, with the exceptions of samples A_SDS_0.75 and A_CTAB_1.25.\nThe experimental values obtained for carbon and hydrogen, in this test, are now compared with the theoretical values calculated based on structure assumptions. This comparison allows for a more rigorous explanation on why there are small variations on the percentages of C, since these variations can be related with the extension of the condensation reactions.\nThe theoretical values are calculated using the hypothetical chemical structure of the MTMS-derived aerogels. Therefore, two different scenarios are assumed: the first scenario, corresponds to a complete condensation, where each existing silicon atom (Si) is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3) and three oxygens (O), which in turn are also bonded to other silicon atoms - since these oxygens are shared, each Si atom corresponds to 1,5 oxygen atoms; the second scenario considers an incomplete condensation meaning that each Si atom is bonded to a methyl group, two shared oxygens and one non-shared hydroxide (-OH) group. Without surfactant, the elements that are present in the skeleton are only Si. O, C and H. In Table 4.3 the theoretical mass percentages calculated for the elements C, H and Si + O are presented.\nThe performed calculations can be found on Appendix D. For this calculus, the hydroxyl groups remaining at the end of the structure were not taken into account.\nTable 4.3 - Theoretical elemental mass percentages calculated for MTMS-derived aerogels.\nScenario\tAerogel\t% C (w/w)\t% H (w/w)\t% Si + % O (w/w)\nComplete\t\t17.9\t4.5\t77.6\nCondensation\tMTMS\t\t\t\nIncomplete\t\t15.8\t5.3\t78.9\nCondensation\t\t\t\t\nIt can be seen in Table 4.3 that the theoretical mass percentage of carbon is lower when compared to the experimental values. This means that the complete condensation scenario is the most likely, but it also indicates the presence of residual surfactant in the final material. Indeed, the used surfactants have a C chain with not less than 10 carbons in the chain. Again, the residual surfactant was not detected by FTIR in Figures 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. The highest values of % C were observed in samples A_CTAB_1.50 and in F127 samples, suggesting a higher retention of the surfactant in the aerogel's structure.\nThe % H follows the same trend observed in the % C values. Samples A, A_CTAB_1.25 and A_SDS_0.75 show values that support the complete condensation hypothesis. The remaining samples show values more close those of incomplete condensation and/or had some surfactant entrapped inside the silica structure. Since the surfactant can also prevent the\n4 Results and discussion growth of the silica structure, leading to a more incomplete condensation, the increase in the % H supports this claim, but the two effects may overlap.\nAt this point, some conclusions can be drawn. It is likely that some ammonium hydroxide remained in the samples A_CTAB_1.50 and A_SDS_0.75, making them harder to dry. All aerogel samples show a % C consistent with the complete condensation hypothesis, but the increase of the % C in the samples prepared with surfactant when compared to the value in sample A evidences that residual surfactant remains in the aerogels after drying.\n4.2.3\tContact angles\nThe contact angles were measured with water in order to evaluate the hydrophobicity of the samples. The obtained results, accompanied with the respective confidence interval at 95%, can be seen in Table 4.4.\nTable 4.4 - Contact angles with water for the MTMS-derived aerogels with and without surfactant.\nSample\tAverage 0c (\u00b0)\nA\t136 \u00b1 6\nA_CTAB_0.50\t148 \u00b1 6\nA_CTAB_0.75\t149 \u00b1 13\nA_CTAB_1.00\t141 \u00b1 10\nA_CTAB_1.25\t143 \u00b1 10\nA CTAB 1.50\t141 \u00b1 9\nA_F127_0.50\t142 \u00b1 8\nA_F127_0.75\t140 \u00b1 4\nA_F127_1.00\t141 \u00b1 3\nA_F127_1.25\t141 \u00b1 3\nA F127 1.50\t142 \u00b1 7\nA_SDS_0.50\t138 \u00b1 9\nA SDS 0.75\t137 \u00b1 6\nBased on the presented results, all samples are highly hydrophobic, with contact angles well above 90\u00b0. It confirms that the MTMS precursor forms hydrophobic structures, as expected, due to the presence of methyl groups in the network. These groups are non-polar and have no affinity for water molecules, which are polar. As such, the adsorption of the water molecules into the silica structure is disfavored.\nThe presence of the surfactant, as seen in Table 4.4 and considering the confidence intervals, seems to cause an apparent tendency to make the structure slightly more hydrophobic, with the values practically constant around 141\u00b0. This suggests a rearrangement of the MTMS-derived methyl groups in the silica structure due to the presence of the surfactants. The non-polar chains in the surfactants and the methyl groups have affinity for\none another and align themselves in order to reach a lower energy state during the gelation step. This can lead to a better distribution of the methyl groups in the structure. Moreover, the presence of the surfactant also may lead to non-separation of phases, regulating the pores sizes. This may also have an effect in the values of the contact angle if the porous structure becomes more regular with thinner pores. Overall, it can be said that the moisture of the environment is not a problem for the stability of the prepared aerogels, as they will not degrade upon exposure to water-containing environments.\n4.2.4\tZeta potential\nThis technique was employed in order to assess the surface charge of the MTMS-derived aerogels and to theoretically ascertain which type of surfactant could be the most promising one in terms of interactions in the gelation medium. The result obtained for the pure sample, with the respective confidence interval at 95%, is -9.25 \u00b1 1.46 mV.\nThe achieved result shows that the MTMS-derived particles are negatively charged in their surface. This means that the cationic surfactant, CTAB, has electro-chemical attraction for the MTMS-derived aerogel. This possibly allows, in conjunction with the non-polar affinity already discussed, a greater structuration of the silica network.\nThe anionic surfactant, SDS, would be repelled by the net charge of the MTMS-derived species, but since it also has a hydrocarbon chain, the methyl groups would still have some affinity for the surfactant. Thus, some degree of structuration is still expected to be seen.\nThe nonionic surfactant, F127, should just work with the non-polar affinity of the involved species.\n4.3\tPhysical/Structural characterization of the aerogels\n4.3.1\tPorosity\nSample\tps(kg.m-3)\te (%)\nA\t1036 \u00b1 78\t94.9\nA_CTAB_1.25\t1110\u00b147\t96.0\nA_F127_1.25\t1150\u00b1123\t95.7\nA SDS 0.75\t1280 \u00b1176\t96.5\nIt can be verified in Table 4.5 that the porosity reaches higher values for samples A_CTAB_1.25, A_F127_1.25 and A_SDS_0.75 with 43.9, 49.4 and 45.3 kg.m-3 of bulk density respectively (see section 4.1), than for the sample without surfactant (53.2 kg.m-3 of bulk density). The porosity results show an average increase of 1% when compared with sample A.\nThis was expected, as the bulk density had minimum values for these selected samples with surfactant. Moreover, the lowest bulk density was achieved in the case of addition of CTAB. This result validates the already established idea that CTAB should theoretically be the surfactant to use in order to achieve the better results in terms of structuration of the silica network.\nBased on porosity values, it can be said that the surfactant clearly supplies a rearrangement in the structure because the overall bulk density is reduced in the presence of a surfactant.\n4.3.2\tSEM\nWith SEM analysis a deeper knowledge on the silica microstructure can be achieved. The chosen samples were observed in different magnifications, 1000x, 10000x and 25000x. However, here, only the lowest and highest magnifications will be presented. Figures 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 present the different SEM micrographs obtained for sample A, the samples with CTAB, the samples with F127 and the sample with SDS.\nFigure 4.5 - SEM micrographs for sample A at 1000x and 25000x.\nFor sample A, in Figure 4.5, we can visualize a porous morphology with a random organization. This sample also seems to be constituted by the aggregation/linking of small structural units of very small dimensions (<&lt;1 pm). At low magnification, it is noticeable that very large pores or regions without aerogel exist.\nFigure 4.6 - SEM micrographs for samples A_CTAB_0.75, A_CTAB_1.25 and A_CTAB_1.50 at 1000x and 25000x.\nBy observation of A_CTAB_0.75 sample in Figure 4.6, it can easily be seen that the particles that constitute the structure are bigger, with distinct necks and the network does not exhibit large holes as in sample A. This is consistent with the previous results of a denser material. In samples A_CTAB_1.25 and A_CTAB_1.50 is seen that the presence of the surfactant is enough to create larger pores in the structure, but the network keeps a regular pattern. The particles that make up the nanostructure are once again much smaller than 1 pm. This is consistent with the reduction in the bulk density obtained for these samples.\nFigure 4.7 - SEM micrographs for samples A_F127_0.75, A_F127_1.25 and A_F127_1.50 at 1000x and 25000x.\nFigure 4.8 - SEM micrographs for sample A_SDS_0.75 at 1000x and 25000x.\nThrough the visualization of the micrographs in Figure 4.7 and in comparison with sample A, it can be said that in samples A_F127_0.75 and A_F127_1.25 the nanoparticles of the structure have a similar size to the ones in sample A but in sample A_F127_1.50 these nanoparticles seem to have grown and are more agglomerated. In general, in these micrographs the pores seem to be bigger than the ones in sample A, appearing again some large holes especially in sample A_F127_1.50. This is likely due to the fact that the F127 is a big molecule, with approximately 12600 Da, and it imprints huge holes in the structure when it is removed from there. It is also noticeable the presence, in all the micrographs of Figure 4.7, of some weird structures, in form of long rods and spheres, in the middle of the nanostructure. Possibly these are due to the achievement of the critical micellar concentration of the surfactant and the growth of the silica network inside the micelles (see the shape of micelles in section 2.4). The aforementioned structures are better seen in Figure 4.9.\nFigure 4.9 - SEM micrographs of the wierd structures produced when using F127.\nWhen assessing Figure 4.8, we can immediately see the stark difference of the overall morphology of the sample A_SDS_0.75 when compared with sample A. The network is very dense and closed, with a homogeneous surface, unlike sample A. This sample clearly seems to have a much more regular nanostructure. Also mentionable is the size of the nanoparticles that is even much smaller than those in sample A. It is worth noting that these structural units, seen in all the micrographs of this section, are what is designated in the literature as secondary silica particles.\nIn summary, the SEM results seem to be consistent with the previously discussed topics, especially the fact that the charged surfactants should be the best to be used when wanting to synthesize a more organized silica structure.\n4.3.3\tASAP\nWith the ASAP technique, it is now possible to ascertain properties like specific surface area and the average pore size distribution of the materials, which can validate (or not) the conclusions drawn until this point.\nThe evaluation of the results will be conducted in three stages. The first stage presents the specific surface area, in Table 4.6, and the respective reached correlation by application of the BET theory; the second is where the equations of Kelvin and Halsey are applied through the BJH's algorithm, giving the results presented in Table 4.7; and in the third stage, Figure\n4.10\tshows the obtained desorption results for the pore size distribution.\nTable 4.6 - Specific surface area of the selected aerogels.\nSample\t4S BET (m2/g)\tR2\nA\t321.8 \u00b1 6.5\t0.9992\nA_CTAB_1.25\t435.7 \u00b1 7.1\t0.9995\nA_F127_1.25\t181.0 \u00b1 9.2\t0.9949\nA SDS 0.75\t345.2 \u00b1 5.9\t0.9994\nBy observation of Table 4.6, it can be concluded that the sample with the highest specific surface area is sample A_CTAB_1.25, which is consistent with the previous assumption that this would be the ideal type and amount of surfactant to be used in order to improve the base properties of a MTMS-derived aerogel synthesized under the established conditions. The sample A_F127_1.25 presents the lowest specific surface area, again in agreement with the obtained SEM and density results. The surface area is lower than that obtained for sample A, possibly because the polymer F127 leads to the closing of part of the pores. It should be also mentioned that, although sample A_SDS_0.75 has a higher specific surface area than sample A, there is not a significant difference between them, which was not expected since the previously obtained results indicate that A_SDS_0.75 could have a higher specific surface area.\nTable 4.7 - Size and average pore volume for the selected aerogels.\nSample\tBJH Desorption\t\tBJH Adsorption\t\n\tSpores (cm3.g-1)\t^average, pores (^)\tSpores (cm3.g-1)\t^average, pores (^)\nA\t0.21\t38.8\t0.17\t46.7\nA_CTAB_1.25\t0.20\t37.2\t0.14\t45.7\nA_F127_1.25\t0.09\t40.2\t0.09\t37.8\nA SDS 0.75\t0.21\t51.7\t0.14\t49.9\nIn Table 4.7, the visible results demonstrate that the samples A_F127 and A_SDS_0.75 desorbed more than what they adsorbed, meaning that there was gas still trapped inside the\npores and the previous degasification of the material was not sufficient. The pores volume was similar between samples A, A_CTAB_1.25 and A_SDS_0.75 in the desorption or adsorption regimes. However, the results for sample A_F127_1.25 present a pore volume that is half of the other samples, which is lower than the expected for this sample, considering the differences in Figure 4.5 and 4.7. Table 4.7 also reveals that the biggest average pore diameter corresponds to sample A_SDS_0.75, in agreement with the previous obtained results, because with the same volume of pores as in samples A and A_CTAB_1.25 the specific surface area is lower than the one in A_CTAB_1.25. Also mentionable is the fact that the results for A_CTAB_1.25 are also consistent, since, with higher specific surface area and similar pores volume between samples, the average pore diameter had to be at least lower than the pore diameter of sample A. As for the sample A_F127_1.25, the results obtained in Table 4.7 are coherent with the drop in specific surface area, because even if the average pore diameter is similar, there are fewer pores for this sample.\nFrom Table 4.7 it is noticeable that the average pore diameter is predominantly between 3.7 and 5.2 nm, in the range of mesopores (2 nm &lt;mesopores &lt;50 nm) which is further confirmed in Figure 4.10, where the pore size distributions are shown. It should be mentioned that this technique cannot effectively measure pores below 2 nm (micropores) or much larger than 100-200 nm, meaning that the average pore diameter may not represent well the real value.\nFigure 4.10 proves that the average pore diameter is in fact in the mesopores range, with exception of the A_SDS_0.75 sample that indicates the absence of mesopores. This is consistent with discussion in subsection 4.2.4 (zeta potential results), where is stated that there may be repulsion between the MTMS-derived particles and the SDS heads. This can lead to higher aggregation of the silica secondary particles (between themselves), leading to higher extent of\n4 Results and discussion condensation and filling of mesoscale pores. On the other hand, there is an increase in the pore volume in the range or pores higher than 100 nm, resulting in a higher average pore size (Table 4.7)\nBy observation of the individual results for adsorption and desorption isotherms in Appendix E, it can be concluded that the obtained isotherms are of type IV [41J[44J, which is in agreement with the obtained average pore size. In fact, these type IV isotherms are characteristic of mesoporous solids, presenting an initial knee zone which represents the adsorption to a monolayer and also a cycle of hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption isotherms. According to the IUPAC classification, the obtained hysteresis cycle appears to be from type H4, typical of dead-end conical pores or of complex ramified geometries.\n4.4\tMechanical characterization of the aerogels\nThe stress-strain diagrams for the selected samples are presented in Figure 4.11. None of the test samples broke during the test. The calculated Young's moduli for these samples are presented in Table 4.8, for several parts of the stress-strain curve.\nTable 4.8 - Young's modulus for the selected samples.\nSample\tEo to 15% (kPa)\tR2\tE15 to 25% (kPa)\tR2\tE15 to 30% (kPa)\tR2\nA\t4.7\t0.994\t8.5\t0.988\t9.9\t0.985\nA_CTAB_1.25\t1.5\t0.966\t3.0\t0.968\t3.6\t0.982\nA_F127_1.25\t2.7\t0.977\t4.8\t0.986\t5.6\t0.986\nA SDS 0.75\t1.2\t0.887\t3.2\t0.966\t3.9\t0.978\nAll samples have similar stress-strain curves, characteristic of viscoelastic materials. Sample A is the most rigid sample, confirmed by the higher value of the Young's modulus (Table 4.8). The surfactants increased flexibility of the aerogels, shown by the reduction of the value of Young's moduli. This tendency was observed when handling the samples and is consistent with the lower bulk density obtained for the samples with surfactant. The increased flexibility was most significant with 1.25 g of CTAB that featured a modulus of approximately a third of sample A. This cationic surfactant seems to be the one leading to most promising properties of the monoliths, which is consistent with a strong interaction of the surfactant positive head with the negative charge of the aerogels (as observed by zeta potential). As it can be observed, the Young's modulus increases depending on the strain already achieved in the sample (region where the linear regression is applied), since when the sample is under a higher strain (i.e., with more effective bulk density), more resistance it will oppose to further deformation. This is typical of viscoelastic materials because they have the ability to absorb and accommodate the load that is applied to them, but after removing the load they return to the initial shape/size [45]. The deformation during this process is mainly accommodated by the reduction of the size of larger pores originating a flow of the air inside them.\n4.5\tResults of the simulated systems\nRecalling what was previously said in subsections 2.5.2 and 3.3.5 on the most likely cluster conformations formed by MTMS, the cyclic conformation with 4 silicon atoms (hereafter called SI4) and the cage-like conformation with 8 silicon atoms (SI8) were studied. Both SI4 and SI8 were simulated in various quantities, labelled as B1, B2 and B3 for SI4 and C1, C2 and C3 for SI8, and the numbering means that B1 and C1 have both 360 Si atoms, B2 and C2 have 320, and B3 and C3 have 280.\n4.5.1\tVMD\nThe VMD tool was used to obtain the snapshots presented in Figures 4.12 to 4.14. Figure 4.12 presents the simulation boxes at t=0 ns, in which only the MTMS-derived particles, SI4 (simulation B1) and SI8 (simulation C1), are represented (the other specimens included in the simulations, viz. methanol and CTAB, are not shown for the sake of simplicity; all the figures have pictures in the same orthographic frontal view as seen by the axis displayed in each picture and for better understanding of the evolution of the simulations please consult Appendix F). The algorithm randomly places the particles inside the simulation box, and these data are enough to establish a base point for comparison with the pattern reached at the end of the simulation (t=80 ns) as shown in Figures 4.13 and 4.14.\nB1\nS \u25a0**\n*\ntv\n\u201cTV 1\nFigure 4.12 - Simulation boxes at t=0 for B1 and C1 (see text for labeling).\nC1\n360\n320\n280\n4*\nB3\nB3_CTAB1.25\n\nFigure 4.13 - Simulation boxes after t=80 ns for the indicated for MTMS-derived SI4, with and without surfactant (see text for labeling).\n4 Results and discussion\n360\nFigure 4.14 - Simulation boxes after t=80 ns for the indicated for MTMS-derived SI8, with and without surfactant (see text for labeling).\nIt can be easily seen from Figure 4.12 that in any case the particles start out dispersed in the simulation box. On the other hand, when looking at Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14, it is clear that both SI4 and SI8 specimens tend to form aggregates or clusters, which is consistent with information known from experimental grounds. Although different amounts of surfactant were used, it is not possible to ascertain just by looking at the snapshots whether such a variable influences the number of entities present in the former clusters. However, it is possible to say that the final structures are different in every scenario. Furthermore, the structures formed from SI4 seem to be more compact, which can be explained, apart differences in the molecular volume (lower in SI4 than in SI8), by the contribution of hydrogen bonding, possible in SI4 but not in the caged structures.\n4.5.2\thbond\nThis subsection summarizes the results related to hydrogen bond formation between the Si based particles, applicable only to the SI4 specimen, with the trajectories of interest being presented in Figure 4.15 and 4.16.\n400\nTime (ps)\nFigure 4.15 - Total number of hydrogen bonds between SI4 moieties, without surfactant, as a function of time, in the indicated simulations (see text labelling).\n400\n0\t20000\t40000\t60000\t80000\nTime (ps)\nFigure 4.16 - Total number of possible hydrogen bonds between SI4 moieties, with surfactant, as a function of time, in the indicated simulations (see text for labeling).\n4 Results and discussion\nLooking at Figure 4.15 it is observed that number of hydrogen bonds formed increases with the simulation time and with the concentration of Si4. This is an expected result because the more SI4 in a fixed volume, the more likely is their interaction through hydrogen bonding. In fact, the hydroxyl groups present in SI4 (and absent in SI8) should contribute to the MTMS-derived aerogels structure growing, leading to the condensation reactions presented in subsection 2.3.1.\nThe results in Figure 4.16 show that the presence of CTAB in the system leads to an increase in the rate of the hydrogen bonds at the early simulation stage, the B3_CTAB1.25 being the only exception. In the B3 simulations the presence of CTAB at the end of 80 ns seems to not affect the number of possible hydrogen bonds. As for the B2 simulations some apparent effect is noted because the simulation without surfactant in Figure 4.15 stabilizes close to 300 hydrogen bonds, while with CTAB shown in Figure 4.16 are both closer to 275. No noticeable differences are found between B1 and B1_CTAB0.50 cases. However, the simulation for the optimal laboratory bulk density, B1_CTAB1.25, presents a similar result after 80 ns as the simulation B2 in Figure 4.15. This means that more particles would be necessary to better assess the actual effect of the surfactant in the of hydrogen bonds formation.\n4.5.3\tclustsize\nThe analysis of the clusters formed can be done from the results in Figures 4.17 to 4.19, which show the number of free MTMS-derived particles, SI4 and SI8, and from the results that show the maximum size of clusters in Figures 4.20 to 4.22.\nFree MTMS-derived particles in the simulation\n90\n0\t20000\t40000\t60000\t80000\nTime (ps)\nFigure 4.17 - Number of free MTMS-derived SI4, without surfactant, as a function of time (see text for labeling).\nFigure 4.18 - Number of free MTMS-derived SI4, with surfactant, as a function of time (see text for labeling).\n90\n-----C1_CTAB0.50\t----C1_CTAB1.25\t----C2_CTAB0.50\n80\n-----C2_CTAB1.25\t----C3_CTAB0.50\t----C3_CTAB1.25\noJ 70\n-o\nTime (ps)\nFigure 4.19 - Number of free MTMS-derived SI8, with surfactant, as a function of time (see text for labeling).\nThe results in Figure 4.17 quantitatively confirm the formation of clusters previously seen in subsection 4.5.1 (VMD). Both the simulations with SI4 (B1, B2 and B3) and with SI8 (C1, C2 and C3) tend to have fewer free particles at t=80 ns when compared to those at the very beginning of the simulations. The pattern is the same whatever the number of MTMS-derived particles considered, although the C1, C2 and C3 series (SI8 based systems) appear to be less sensible to that variable.\nAnalyzing the results in both Figure 4.18 and 4.19 no significant changes in the trajectory profiles are found when compared to those in Figure 4.17. This metric does not allow to clearly capture the influence, if any, of the surfactant in the cluster formation.\n4 Results and discussion\nMaximum size of clusters\n50\n0\t20000\t40000\t60000\t80000\nTime (ps)\nFigure 4.20 - Maximum size of clusters( in terms of molecule number), without surfactant, as a function of time(see text for labeling).\nThe results in Figure 4.20 indicate that the number of MTMS-derived particles initially inserted in the 10 nm3 box does not appear to be a factor in the maximum size of the clusters formed. No clear trends can be drawn for the simulated systems from this metric.\n50\n-----B1_CTAB0.50\t------B1_CTAB1.25\t----B2_CTAB0.50\n45\nn\t-----B2 CTAB1.25\t----B3 CTAB0.50\t-----B3 CTAB1.25\nCD\t\u2014\t\u2014\t\u2014\n40\n0\n0\t20000\t40000\t60000\t80000\nTime (ps)\n50\n----C1_CTAB0.50\n----C1_CTAB1.25\n----C2_CTAB0.50\n0\t20000\t40000\t60000\t80000\nTime (ps)\nFigure 4.22 - Maximum size of clusters( in terms of molecule number) for SI8 particles, with surfactant, as a function of time (see text for labeling).\nOverall, the results in Figures 4.21 and 4.22 suggest that the presence of the surfactant seems to reduce the maximum size of a cluster made by MTMS-derived particles. Like as experimentally observed, the presence of the surfactant in the molecular dynamics results shows differences in the end results although no real parallelism was able to be established.\nIt should be stressed that a simulation time of the 80 ns might be not enough to describe the experimental conditions. Furthermore, a model which, besides the solvent and surfactant, includes a single SI4 or SI8 specimen is certainly an oversimplification of the reality. It should be realized, however, that this computational study is nothing but a first step of an expected comprehensive approach, in which a combination of various MTMS-derivatives and larger simulation times must be considered.\n5 Conclusions and future prospects\nIn this work, the effect of different types of surfactants on the microstructure of silica based aerogels derived from MTMS was studied. The surfactants chosen for this work represent several kinds: SDS as anionic, CTAB as the cationic and F127 as non-ionic. Different amounts of surfactant were added to the gel synthesis and these were conditioned by the supercritical drying step, going from 0.50 g to 1.50 g with the CTAB and F127, and from 0.50 g to 0.75 g with SDS.\nThe synthesized materials were characterized chemically, physically/structurally and mechanically. These results allowed to ascertain the effects of the surfactants in the sol-gel chemistry and final material properties.\nThe most promising aerogels were chosen based on the bulk density and the observable characteristics. The envisaged aerogels have lower bulk density, higher flexibility and should feature low particle shedding. Considering this, the selected samples were A, A_CTAB_1.25, A_F127_1.25 and A_SDS_0.75, where sample A is the sample without surfactant that serves as a base comparing point and, in the others, surfactants were used in the synthesis with the indicated amounts (in g).\nFrom the chemical analysis, it was concluded that the aerogels are made up of a silica matrix with methyl groups, consistent with the structure expected from the MTMS precursor. Also, there is evidence that residual amounts of surfactant are still present in the final structure, due to the difference in % C between the pure sample and the samples with surfactant. The contact angle assessment revealed that the starting material is already quite hydrophobic (0c = 136\u00b0), however, surfactants tend to increase this characteristic (up to 149\u00b0). Moreover, the zeta potential showed that the MTMS-derived particles are negatively charged (-9.25 mV) in their surface, meaning that the cationic surfactant, CTAB, interacts electrostatically with the MTMS-derived aerogel.\nFrom a structural point of view, it was found that the use of surfactants does not hinders the highly porous nature of the aerogels. The specific surface area of the materials was impacted by the type of surfactant used: CTAB increased this property while F127 lowered it C^s, CTAB = 436; ^s, F127 = 181; ^s, SDS = 345; ^s, puro = 322 m2.g-1).\nThe SEM analysis reveals a microstructure consistent with organically modified silica aerogels. This result is in agreement with the FTIR analysis that revealed the formation of the MTMS-derived matrix. The amount and type of surfactant added originated different microstructures in terms of particle shape and sizes and pore sizes.\n5 Conclusions and future prospects\nAs it was already noticeable by the handling of the samples, the surfactants decreased the value of the Young's modulus (which was already extremely low, &lt;9.9 kPa), increasing the flexibility of these materials by up to four times (comparing the modulus obtained with a strain from 0 to 15%). The obtained aerogels are extremely flexible not breaking with compressions up to 50 % strain. CTAB was the surfactant which led to the most flexible aerogels.\nWithin the framework of molecular dynamics based study, two types of MTMS derived specimens were considered: one cyclic, with 4 silicon atoms (SI4), and the other, a cage-type molecule with 8 silicon atoms (SI8). By varying the total number of silicon atoms from Si8 and Si4 specimens and CTAB in the simulation box, the trajectories of 80 ns simulations were analyzed. Being an exploratory study, the results obtained from this approach were not conclusive, possibly because the simulation time was not long enough to appropriately study these systems. Nonetheless, the simulations showed that hydrogen bonds are formed and the initial MTMS derivatives are prone to aggregate into clusters. The structures formed from SI4 seem to be more compact, which can be explained, apart the differences in the molecular volume (lower in SI4 than in SI8), by the contribution of hydrogen bonding. The presence of CTAB seems to affect the clusters, diminishing their sizes.\nThe computational work was restricted by the computational resources. Different simulations should be performed including the variation of pH, the use of other MTMS based structures and mixtures thereof (the used specimens studied are a limited representation of reality). Better parameterized force fields and increased simulation time ought to improve the obtained results. Different metrics should also be employed to analyze the final results. Due to time constraints, it was not possible to study by molecular dynamics simulations the surfactants SDS and F127, used experimentally in this work. This task should be considered for future works.\nAs stated previously, for the proposed application of employing the synthesized aerogels for insulation in spatial applications and building construction, lightweight, porous and flexible materials are of utmost importance. As it can be seen, the aerogels prepared in this work contribute to the advance of these materials, as they show improved properties.\nReferences\n1.\tM. A. Aegerter, N. Leventis, M. M.
