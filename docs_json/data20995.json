The performance of a microlysimeter \n\n(ML) to measure soil evaporation under irrigation and non-irrigation was evaluated.

Four MLs were uniformly distributed on the soil surface of two weighing \n\nlysimeters conducted under bare soil, previously installed at Iapar, in Londrina, PR, Brazil. The \n\nlysimeters had 1.4 m width, 1.9 m length and 1.3 m depth and were conducted with and without \n\nirrigation. Evaporation measurements by MLs (EML) were compared with measurements by \n\nlysimeters (EL) during four different periods in the year. Differences between EML and EL were \n\nsmall either for low or high atmospheric demand and also for either irrigated or non-irrigated \n\nconditions, which indicates that the ML tested here is suitable for measurement of soil evaporation. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS: water management, water balance, lysimeters, soil water. \n\n \n\n \n\nTESTE DE UM MICROLIS\u00cdMETRO PARA A MEDI\u00c7\u00c3O DA EVAPORA\u00c7\u00c3O DO SOLO \n \n\nRESUMO: A quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o da evapora\u00e7\u00e3o do solo \u00e9 requerida em estudos de balan\u00e7o h\u00eddrico de \n\nculturas e em aplica\u00e7\u00f5es que visam a aumentar a efici\u00eancia do uso da \u00e1gua pelos cultivos.

(1995) and ALLEN et al. (1998), the \n\nevaporation corresponds to the portion of evapotranspiration that is unusable for crop productivity \n\nand its participation as a component of water balance can take on significant values in case of bare \n\nsoil or when the crop partially covers the ground, especially under conditions of more arid climate. \n\n\n\nTest of a microlysimeter for measurement of soil evaporation \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.32, n.1, p.80-90, jan./fev. 2012 \n\n81 \n\nAccording to REICHARDT (1985), SINCLAIR (1990) and ALLEN et al. (1998), the \n\nevaporation consists of passing the water of the soil from liquid to gaseous form in the atmosphere, \n\nand this process is ruled by physical laws. \n\nThe amount of energy available in the environment, usually in the form of solar radiation, \n\nsubstantially influences the evaporation of water. Solar radiation heats the ground surface and the \n\nlayers of air in contact with it, increasing the temperature and, thus, providing more energy for the \n\nevaporative process. The humidity also influences evaporation, as the passage of water from soil to \n\nthe atmosphere is given by the difference in vapor pressure between the soil surface and the layer of \n\nair that is in contact. Finally, the wind favors evaporation due to the fact that the flow of air \n\nremoves the moist air in contact with the soil surface and leaves the dry air in place, renewing the \n\nvapor pressure deficit. All of these climatic variables that influence the evaporative process are \n\nknown to represent the atmospheric demand (TANNER, 1957; ALLEN et al., 1998). \n\nHowever, evaporation is not a process that depends only on the condition of the surrounding \n\natmosphere, but also depends on hydro-physical properties of soil. Thus, beside the weather \n\nconditions, another condition that influences the evaporation is the water supply of the lower layers \n\nin the soil profile to its surface. This supply is regulated by the matric potential and hydraulic \n\nconductivity of the soil, been these features conditioned mainly by the soil structure, density and \n\nporosity (LEMON, 1956; IDSO et al., 1974).  \n\nLEMON (1956), working under laboratory conditions, divided the process of evaporation of \n\nwater from bare soil in three distinct phases, later proven in the field by IDSO et al. (1974). The \n\nfirst phase is characterized for presenting potential evaporation rate and is dependent only on the \n\nconditions prevailing in the atmosphere near the ground. This phase is independent of soil moisture \n\nconditions under the assumption that there is no restriction on the upward flow of water in the \n\nprofile. The first phase ends when is established resistance to the water flow toward the soil surface \n\nand the evaporation rate is no longer potential, decreasing with time. In the second phase, the \n\nintrinsic soil conditions limit the transport of water in the profile and hence the evaporation rate. \n\nThus, in this phase LEMON (1956) considers that the evaporation rate decreases linearly with the \n\ndecrease in average moisture of the soil profile and atmospheric conditions are no longer of \n\nimportance. When the variation of evaporation in response to the decrease of soil moisture becomes \n\nvery small, losing linearity, the third phase begins. This phase is characterized by a rather slow \n\nmovement of water toward the surface, due to low hydraulic conductivity of the soil. \n\nFor BOND &amp; WILLIS (1970), the evaporation of water in the soil can be described in two \n\nphases, because the authors consider that the third phase rarely happens in practice. Thus, the \n\nauthors defined the Phase 1, in which the soil is wet and evaporation is led by the demand of the \n\natmosphere, and Phase 2, which is led by the resistance to the flow of water in the soil. According \n\nto the authors, this resistance increases with decreasing moisture from the surface layer, causing the \n\nevaporation rate to become a decreasing portion of the atmospheric demand. \n\nRITCHIE model (1972) was a major breakthrough in the quantification of soil water \n\nevaporation and transpiration separately on cropped surfaces. Their estimate was obtained through \n\nthe distribution of the energy that drives the two processes as a function of the crop leaf area index, \n\nusing a simple mathematical description of the evaporative process in two distinct phases. \n\nUsually evaporation is measured in terms of bare soil using lysimeters (WALKER, 1983). For \n\nconditions of cultivated soils, models like RITCHIE\u2019s (1972) are considered adequate to estimate it, \n\nsince it cannot separate their measurement of transpiration using lysimeters. As an alternative to the \n\nmeasurement of evaporation in bare or cultivated soil, the use of microlysimeters (ML) is \n\nconsidered adequate (BURT et al., 2005). The MLs are made up of small tubes filled with soil of \n\nintact structure, installed at ground level and weighed periodically to measure the difference in mass \n\nby evaporation during the period. So far, some studies have succeeded in developing and / or testing \n\nthe MLs to measure soil evaporation (BOAST &amp; ROBERTSON, 1982; WALKER, 1983; ALLEN, \n\n\n\nDanilton L. Flumignan, Rog\u00e9rio T. de Faria, Bruno P. Lena \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.32, n.1, p.80-90, jan./fev. 2012 \n\n82 \n\n \n\n1990; VILLALOBOS &amp; FERERES, 1990; DAAMEN et al., 1993; EVETT et al., 1995; \n\nDALMAGO et al, 2010). \n\nTherefore, the objective of this study was to test a microlysimeter model to measure the soil \n\nevaporation in irrigated and non-irrigated conditions, so that it can be used in many applications \n\nwhere it is required. \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nThe experiment was conducted at the Agronomic Institute of Paran\u00e1 (Iapar) in Londrina, PR, \n\nBrazil (latitude 23\u00b018'S, 51\u00ba09'W longitude and altitude of 585 m). The soil is classified as Oxisol \n\n(EMBRAPA, 1999), showing a layer of 0 to 20 cm, 12% sand, 14% silt and 74% clay. The climate \n\nis humid subtropical (Cfa) according to K\u00f6ppen's classification (IAPAR, 1994). \n\nThe MLs (Figure 1 and 2) were built with rigid PVC pipes, measuring 100 mm internal \n\ndiameter, 150 mm deep and 2.5 mm wall thickness, with one of the edges beveled to facilitate \n\npenetration into the soil (Figures 1B and 2A). It was made also a wrapper to the ML consisting of a \n\ntubular-shaped structure of PVC similar to ML, but 110 mm of internal diameter (Figures 1C, 2A \n\nand B). \n\n \n\n \nFIGURE 1. Components of a microlysimeter system for measurement of soil evaporation, in which \n\n(A) is cap to avoid drainage, (B) is microlysimeter, (C) is outer envelope, and (D) is \n\ninstalled microlysimeter. \n\n \n\n     \n \n\nFIGURE 2. Microlysimeter installed with the outer envelope (A), outer envelope in detail (B), and \n\nmicrolysimeter weighing (C). \n\n \n\nThe ML was filled with soil monolith (Figure 2A), obtained by its penetration into the profile \n\nfrom the tip of the beveled edge, using light strokes with a mallet in a small wooden board \n\npositioned at the opposite end of the beveled edge up the soil surface to stay within the ML to \n\napproximately 0.5 cm from the edge. To facilitate the penetration and preserve the soil structure, the \n\nwalls of the ML were lubricated with a small amount of vegetable oil. \n\nA B C \n\nCap \n\nMicrolysimeter Outer envelope \nInstalled \n\nmicrolysimeter \n\nSoil \n\n\n\nTest of a microlysimeter for measurement of soil evaporation \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.32, n.1, p.80-90, jan./fev. 2012 \n\n83 \n\nOnce installed, the ML was removed with the aid of a metal extractor with dimensions similar \n\nto the wrap, taking care to preserve the structure of the extracted and remaining soil. Besides \n\nextracting the ML, the metal extractor was responsible for giving the format required for the \n\ninsertion of the wrap-site. Then it was cleaned up the external surface and the bottom of the ML \n\nwas stopped up with plastic cap (Figure1A) and duct tape to hold the soil inside the ML and prevent \n\ndrainage. This procedure was adopted to ensure that any change in mass of the ML was due only to \n\nwater evaporation from the soil (EVETT et al., 1995). The installation was completed by placing \n\nthe envelope on the site where the monolith was extracted, after filling the bottom of the opening \n\nwith a layer of approximately 0.2 cm of rice husk to prevent adhesion of the lysimeter soil at the \n\nbottom of ML, isolating them in terms of energy exchange (EVETT et al., 1995). \n\nEvaporation of microlysimeter (EML) was calculated by the following relationship: \n\nP\nA\n\nM\nE\n\nML\n\nML\nML\n\n?\n?\n\n?  (01) \n\nIn which: \n\nEML \u2013 soil evaporation measured with microlysimeter, mm; \n\n?MML \u2013 microlysimeter variation of mass, kg; \n\nAML \u2013 microlysimeter surface area with a value of 0.00785 m\n2\n, and \n\nP \u2013 precipitation, mm. \n\n \n\nThe precipitation was obtained from the meteorological station of the Institute SIMEPAR \n\nlocated next to the experiment. There were considered null the drainage and runoff due to the seal \n\nof the bottom of the ML and the raised edge of the same (0.5 cm), respectively. \n\nFour MLs were installed evenly distributed over the area of two weighing lysimeters of high \n\nprecision, one containing bare soil under irrigation and one without. The EML measurements \n\nobtained by mass variation of the MLs, by Equation 1, were made daily, at approximately 5pm, \n\nusing a precision scale and of 1 mg intervals and 2 kg capacity (Figure 2C). Before weighing the \n\nML were always clean out to remove any aggregated material. \n\nThe lysimeter evaporation measurements (EL) were obtained in the weighing lysimeters \n\nevery 10 minutes and then accumulated to the same measurement period of the EML. Basically, the \n\nlysimeters are metal tank with dimensions of 1.4 m wide, 1.9 m long and 1.3 m deep, filled with \n\nlocal soil and placed at ground level (FARIA et al. 2006). It can detect mass change of 0.1 mm at \n\nintervals up to 1 h. The lysimeters are sitting on a metal frame attached to a set of levers to reduce \n\nmass by approximately 45 times the total mass (about 6 Mg). They have a drainage system with \n\nwater storage tanks made of two PVC pipes placed under the lysimeters, which enable the storage \n\nof water percolating through the soil profile. Drainage water is accounted by the weighing system to \n\nthe opening of the registers. The variation in weight of each lysimeter is measured by a single load \n\ncell, which sends electrical signals with a sensitivity of 2 + / - 10 mV V\n-1\n\n and works with accuracy \n\nof 0.02% of full scale. The electrical signal from each load cell is captured by a data acquisition \n\nsystem consisting of a multiplexer (AM416 Relay Multiplexer, Campbell Scientific, Logan, USA) \n\nand a data storage unit (CR10X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, USA) to later be transferred to a \n\nmemory module or computer. The conversion of electrical signals to lysimeter mass was performed \n\nby regression equations previously calibrated by FARIA et al. (2006). \n\nThe EL values were determined by accounting of inputs, outputs and storage of water in the \n\nlysimeters according to Equation 2: \n\nP\nA\n\nM\nE\n\nL\n\nL\nL\n\n?\n?\n\n?

There were considered null the runoff due to the raised edge \n\nof the lysimeters (about 3 cm) and the drainage, keeping the reservoirs closed during the evaluation \n\nperiods. \n\n         The irrigation of the irrigated lysimeter was performed before the evaluation period, i.e. \n\nbetween 1 and 10 hours before installation of the ML. To this was applied 10 mm of water across \n\nthe surface of the lysimeter using a plastic watering can. Thus, in calculating EML and EL  the \n\nirrigation was considered null. \n\nBesides EML and EL it was determined the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by the hourly \n\nASCE Penman-Monteith method (ASCE-EWRI 2005), using the program REF-ET (ALLEN, 2000) \n\nfed with hourly data of the weather station of the SIMEPAR Institute. The hourly values of ETo \n\nwere accumulated for the same period of analysis of the MLs and the lysimeters. \n\nIn order to evaluate the quality of the MLs in the determination of soil evaporation, the \n\naverages of four EML values obtained in each lysimeter were compared with the values of EL for \n\nfour different periods (June from 07 to 10/05, September from 20 to 23/05, January 31 to February \n\n03/06 and May from 16 to 19/06). \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nThe evaporation values were lower in non-irrigated treatment, at least until the third or fourth \n\nday after irrigation, when the measures became close between treatments due to drying of the \n\ntopsoil in the irrigated treatment (Figures 3A and B). \n\n \n\nA) Non-irrigated     B) Irrigated \n\n \n\n \n\nPeriod 1 Period 1 \n\nPeriod 2 Period 2 \n\nRain 5 mm Rain 5 mm \n\nE\nv\na\np\no\nra\n\nti\no\nn\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n d\n-1\n\n) \n\nE\nv\na\np\no\nra\n\nti\no\nn\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n d\n-1\n\n) \n\nE\nv\n\na\np\no\n\nra\nti\n\no\nn\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n d\n-1\n\n) \n\nE\nv\n\na\np\no\n\nra\nti\n\no\nn\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n d\n-1\n\n) \n\nDate Date \n\nDate \n\n6/7/05           6/8/05            6/9/05              6/10/05 6/7/05           6/8/05            6/9/05              6/10/05 \n\n9/20/05          9/21/05           9/22/05           9/23/05 \n\nDate \n\n9/20/05          9/21/05           9/22/05           9/23/05 \n\n\n\nTest of a microlysimeter for measurement of soil evaporation \n\nEng.

Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and evaporation of bare soil measured by weighing \n\nlysimeters (Lis) and microlysimeters (ML) in non-irrigated (A) and irrigated (B) \n\ntreatments, during four periods, in Londrina, Paran\u00e1 State, Brazil. \n\n \n\nThe irrigated treatment had evaporative rates close to the ETo on the day of water application \n\nand sudden reduction in subsequent days in all periods analyzed (Figure 3B). Consequently, the \n\nevaporative flow demanded by the atmosphere could be supplied by the moist soil for a period of \n\none day only, during which the soil was in Phase 1 of the evaporation process described by \n\nLEMON (1956), BOND &amp; WILLIS (1970) and IDSO et al. (1974). With the decrease of moisture \n\nin the topsoil, there was increased the resistance to flow of water in order to attend the atmospheric \n\ndemand, observing thus Phase 2 on the subsequent days. Importantly, this finding does not suggest \n\nthat the U parameter of Ritchie's model (RITCHIE, 1972), which indicates the amount of water that \n\nmust be evaporated to start Phase 2 of the process of evaporation, has the same value of the \n\nevaporation determined in first day in the irrigated treatment. This is due to the fact that, \n\nconceptually, according to RITCHIE (1972), the value of the U parameter for a particular type of \n\nsoil should take as a starting point in the soil moisture condition of field capacity. Thus, as irrigation \n\nadopted in this experiment was of fixed dephts (equal to 10 mm) and thus its application did not \n\nensure that the soil was initially at field capacity condition, it was not possible to determine the U \n\nparameter value of Ritchie's model for this soil. \n\nIn terms of the observed relationship between evaporation and demand of the atmosphere, \n\nduring the Period 4 ETo values were found to be on average around 2.74 mm d\n-1\n\n (Figure 3), and \n\nthat on the first day of evaluation the evaporation in the irrigated treatment was close to the ETo for \n\nboth measured by the lysimeter (3.02 mm d\n-1\n\n) and by ML (3.36 mm d\n-1\n\n), indicating the satisfaction \n\nof 100% of the atmospheric demand. In subsequent days, due to drying of the soil surface, \n\nevaporation decreased to values close to 40% of ETo on the last day (1.12 mm d\n-1\n\n for EML and 1.06 \n\nmm d\n-1\n\n to EL). In non-irrigated treatment, as the surface soil was dry due to the lack of precipitation \n\nin place for more than 30 days, the evaporation values were low throughout the period 4, resulting \n\nto the last day of the period values of EML and EL of 0.47 and 0.54 mm d\n-1\n\n, corresponding to 17.5 \n\nand 20.1% of ETo. The comparison between EML and EL for that period showed that the largest \n\ndeviations were only 0.29 mm d\n-1\n\n for non-irrigated treatment and 0.34 mm d\n-1\n\n for the irrigated \n\ntreatment.

During this period the maximum \n\ndifference between EML and EL was small for the non-irrigated treatment (0.26 mm d\n-1\n\n), but \n\nrelatively higher for the irrigated treatment (0.85 mm d\n-1\n\n, obtained on the first day). This larger \n\ndeviation may be due to the fact that one ML showed a fairly high amount of evaporation of soil \n\nwater compared to the others, which meant that the average was high and the average error was also \n\none of the highest, indicating the great variability in the ML data for that day (Table 1). The high \n\nvalue of evaporation is apparently related to irrigation, because on that day the water application \n\nwas performed only one hour prior to the installation of the ML, and that it had rained (45 mm) five \n\ndays prior to installation of the ML, indicating that the surface of the soil was previously wet. Thus, \n\nit is possible that the application of water was more concentrated in the region where it was \n\ninstalled the refered ML, together with the fact that was not given enough time to distribute the \n\nwater in the soil, both laterally and in depth, so that ML had more moisture, and then showed higher \n\nevaporation on the first day. In subsequent days, due to the distribution of moisture and considering \n\nthe evaporative losses from the first day, there was no longer any problem of this type. A similar \n\nsituation was reported by Allen (1990), in which the values of evaporation in the early days were \n\noverestimated when the MLs were installed shortly after the occurrence of precipitation. Thus, it is \n\nimportant to recommend that when installing the ML after an irrigation or rain event, take into \n\naccount aspects of water depth applied to the soil, long after application and soil water distribuition \n\ncapacity. \n\nAlso in Period 2, the precipitation of 5 mm occurred during the third day of assessment does \n\nnot preclude any measures of evaporation obtained in MLs, in disagreement with ALLEN (1990) \n\n\n\nTest of a microlysimeter for measurement of soil evaporation \n\nEng. Agr\u00edc., Jaboticabal, v.32, n.1, p.80-90, jan./fev. 2012 \n\n87 \n\nand DAAMEN et al. (1993) who claim that the MLs have faulty data for days with precipitation. \n\nThis finding may have been differentiated from that found by these authors because the \n\nprecipitation, as well as small volume, occurred in a distributed manner throughout the day. In other \n\nperiods evaluated in this study, the data were discarded (data not shown), because the precipitation \n\nwas concentrated in short periods of evaporation and the values measured in the MLs were not \n\nreally representative, agreeing to ALLEN (1990) and DAAMEN et al. (1993). The failures in MLs \n\ndays of precipitation may be associated with several factors, including: inequality of precipitation \n\nthat reaches the gauge and the ML, differences in measurements between gauges and ML, inhibition \n\nof drainage in the MLs, the effect of the impact of drops in the removal of soil particles within the \n\nML, depth and intensity of precipitation. Under conditions of cultivated soil the difference may be \n\neven greater, because the canopy intercepts rainwater and distributes unevenly in MLs that are \n\ndistributed in the soil. Continuing the analysis of the Period 2, it was noted that the next day of the \n\nprecipitation (fourth day), the measured values of evaporation in both treatments were very close to \n\nthe ETo, indicating a return to Phase 1 of evaporation described by LEMON (1956), BOND &amp; \n\nWILLIS (1970) and IDSO et al. (1974). \n\nAs shown in Table 1, without making distinction between the treatments studied, the \n\ndeviations found between measurements obtained by lysimeters and MLs were within the range of \n\n\u00b1 0.3 mm d\n-1\n\n in most cases (93.75% of the data ) and within the range of \u00b1 0.15 mm d\n-1\n\n in more \n\nthan half (56.25% of data). \n\nThe 16 EML average obtained for treatment with and without irrigation were submitted to \n\nregression analysis assuming the values of EL as a reference (Figure 4). It is possible to notice that \n\nthe data show little scatter about the 1:1 line for both treatments. The point that was farthest from \n\nthe line was measured for the irrigated treatment on 09/20/2005 (Period 2), as discussed above. \n\nThe adjusted equations indicate that the data obtained by MLs and lysimeters were close \n\namong them, showing the good agreement between the methods based on high values of R\n2\n found, \n\n0.9263 to non-irrigated treatment and 0.9373 to irrigated. The MLs underestimated the evaporation \n\nat 4.4% for non-irrigated treatment and overestimated at 3.64% for the irrigated treatment. The \n\nunderestimation found in the non-irrigated treatment may be related to inhibition of capillary rise \n\nthat occurs in the ML, limiting the amount of water that rises to the surface of soil to be evaporated, \n\nwhile the overestimation observed in the irrigated treatment may be related to the discrepant \n\nmeasure obtained on 09/20/2005. \n\n \n\n \nFIGURE 4.

Considering the 16 \n\ndays of measurements, the difference between EL and EML can be considered negligible, since it is \n\nequivalent to a daily underestimation of only 0.08 mm for the average daily evaporation of about \n\n1.09 mm (<7.5%). In the irrigated treatment, the value accumulated in the lysimeters was equal to \n\n31.56 mm, while the accumulated value for the MLs was equal to 32.63 mm (1.07 mm higher). This \n\noverestimation is also considered small, since it is equivalent to the deviation of about 0.067 mm \n\nper day for the average daily evaporation determined on the lysimeters of 1.97 mm, approximately \n\n(<3,5%). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFIGURE 5. Accumulated evaporation of bare soil under non-irrigated and irrigated treatments, \n\ndetermined by weighing lysimeters (Lis) and microlysimeters (ML), during four \n\nperiods, in Londrina, State of Paran\u00e1, Brazil. \n\n \n\nIn this study, the MLs had reliable measurements for up to four consecutive days without \n\nrequiring new installation. It is noteworthy that it was not tested if MLs could be used for longer \n\nperiods even though the data in the literature suggest that the periods obtained by other authors were \n\nequal to or smaller than those obtained in this study (DAAMEN et al., 1993). \n\nIn general, the life of a ML is directly associated with its moisture from the outer soil, because \n\nit assumes that the moisture inside the ML should represent that found in the soil outside (EVETT \n\net al., 1995). Therefore, the lifetime is mainly determined by the physical and hydraulic properties \n\nof the soil, by the depth of the ML and the behavior of the atmospheric demand (DAAMEN et al., \n\n1993). First, the physical and hydraulic properties of the soil determine its ability to retain water. \n\nThis, when combined with depth of the used ML, is the available water capacity in the soil within \n\nthe ML. The available water capacity is greater, the greater the capacity to retain water in the soil \n\nand the greater the depth of the ML. In this condition the lifetime of ML should be higher. Another \n\nimportant factor is the initial moisture content at the time of installation of the ML. It is expected \n\nthat the lifetime of a ML should be much lower, the lower the initial moisture content, because the \n\namount of available water to be evaporated should be small. Finally, with respect to atmospheric \n\ndemand in periods of cloudy weather, when the demand is lower, evaporation rates should be low \n\nand therefore the lifetime of a given ML will be higher, because the available water to be \n\nevaporated in ML is reduced gradually.

(1993), the lifetime of an ML is also influenced by their \n\nsources of intrinsic errors to the method as limiting the drainage and capillary rise caused by the \n\nbottom closing, the interruption of the water extraction by the roots by isolating the soil in the case \n\nof cultivated soils, the degree of soil disturbance caused during its extraction and heat conduction in \n\nthe ML. \n\nALLEN (1990) worked with MLs of similar dimensions to this study and period of lifetime \n\nobtained was equal to two days. DAAMEN et al. (1993) working with ML 100 mm depth obtained \n\nlifetime of 3 days. In general, the lifetime of ML obtained by these studies is lower because the \n\nauthors worked under conditions of semi-arid climates and soils with lower water holding capacity, \n\nwhich caused the moisture inside the ML differs from outside more quickly. \n\nThe field activities that were developed in this study demonstrates that the greatest difficulty \n\nwith respect to the management of MLs is its installation, because due to the clay soil and moist, \n\nthis procedure requires great care to preserve the soil structure extracted and remaining. Cleaning \n\nthe outside to be held after the extraction of the ML is also a laborious task, because there is much \n\nadhesion of clay in the PVC, being difficult to remove. Studies with the MLs require mainly two \n\npeople to install, but once installed, it is low laborious, and it requires only the daily presence of a \n\nperson to accomplish the weighing, which takes a few minutes. In this specific case study where \n\nwere used eight MLs, two people required approximately one hour to perform its installation. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nThe microlysimeters model tested in this study is precise and practical to measure soil \n\nevaporation in soil irrigated and without irrigation, under low and high atmospheric demand. \n\n \n\nACKNOLEDGEMENTS \n\nTo the Agricultural Technician of Iapar, Jose Carlos da Silva, to the great support in the field \n\nand laboratory work. \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nALLEN, R.G.
