However, such products can, in a certain extent, be \n\ncontaminated with some chemicals, like toxic elements, coming from several sources. In \n\nPortugal these products assume particular importance since, within European Union countries, \n\nit is the one presenting the highest per capita consumption, about 56 kg / person / year. In this \n\ncontext, the primary aim of this work was to characterize the proximate and elemental profile of \n\nsome seafood, commercialized in Portugal, in order to contribute for the evaluation of benefits \n\nand the hazards associated to their consumption.  \n\nAll products presented a similar pattern in what regards the essential elements. Dominant \n\nconstituents were potassium, chloride, sulphur, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium and calcium. \n\nInteresting contents of zinc, copper and iron were also found, mainly in the three cephalopods \n\nand the crustacean. The results lead to the conclusion that these species can be a major \n\ncontribution to the recommended daily intakes of essential elements. \n\nAppreciable amounts of total arsenic were detected in Norway lobster and octopus; however, \n\nas about 90 % of this element is mostly in organic form in marine organisms, these species do \n\nnot constitute a hazard in terms of human consumption. The highest total mercury contents \n\nwere found in deep-water fish species while the lowest were found in bivalve molluscs. Canned \n\nseafood reflected the profile of raw-material. Regarding lead and cadmium, the levels detected \n\nin all edible part of samples were below the EU limits with the exception of some mollusc \n\nsamples. \n\nAttending the results obtained, this study supports the importance of promoting consumption \n\nof fishery and aquaculture products, although some species have to be consumed moderately \n\ngiven the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) values for toxic metals recommended by \n\nFAO/WHO. The probability of exceeding the methyl-mercury PTWI, among the three \n\ncephalopods in Portugal, is considered minor. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey-words: fishery and aquaculture products; essential macro and micro elements; toxic \n\nelements; risks assessment. \n\n\n\nii \n\nRESUMO \n\nOs produtos da pesca e aquicultura s\u00e3o considerados indispens\u00e1veis num regime alimentar \n\nequilibrado, porque t\u00eam elevados teores de prote\u00edna e de \u00e1cidos gordos polinsaturados do tipo \n\n\u00f3mega-3, apresentam baixos n\u00edveis de colesterol e s\u00e3o uma excelente fonte de quase todos os \n\nelementos, considerados essenciais para o homem. Al\u00e9m disso, s\u00e3o um alimento de digest\u00e3o \n\nf\u00e1cil. No entanto, estes produtos podem, em certa medida, conter alguns contaminantes \n\nqu\u00edmicos, como os elementos considerados t\u00f3xicos (ars\u00e9nio, c\u00e1dmio, chumbo e merc\u00fario), \n\nprovenientes quer de fontes antropog\u00e9nicas quer de fontes naturais. Estes elementos podem \n\nser assimilados, armazenados e concentrados pelos organismos vivos, atrav\u00e9s da cadeia \n\nalimentar, originando efeitos fisiol\u00f3gicos graves.  \n\nEm Portugal, pela posi\u00e7\u00e3o priveligiada no conjunto dos pa\u00edses europeus, devido ao seu \n\nposicionamento geo-estrat\u00e9gico, frontal ao Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico, e pelo conhecimento acumulado \n\nao longo de gera\u00e7\u00f5es das pr\u00e1ticas e t\u00e9cnicas de capturas de esp\u00e9cies marinhas, da sua \n\nconserva\u00e7\u00e3o e transforma\u00e7\u00e3o e da sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o culin\u00e1ria, a pesca e o pescado sempre \n\ntiveram uma elevada import\u00e2ncia s\u00f3cio-econ\u00f3mica. Daqui resulta que Portugal, do conjunto \n\ndos pa\u00edses da Uni\u00e3o Europeia, \u00e9 o que apresenta o maior consumo per capita, cerca de 160 \n\ng/dia. \n\nNeste contexto, o objectivo principal deste trabalho foi o de caracterizar o perfil centesimal e \n\nelementar de algumas esp\u00e9cies de pescado, comercializadas em Portugal, a fim de avaliar os \n\nbenef\u00edcios e os riscos associados ao seu consumo. As esp\u00e9cies seleccionadas foram os \n\ncefal\u00f3podes (choco, lula e polvo), o lagostim e quatro esp\u00e9cies de peixe de aquicultura \n\n(dourada, pregado robalo e truta) por serem muito apreciadas e haver pouca informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre \n\nelas. Assim, para al\u00e9m dos quatro constitu\u00edntes principais, \u00e1gua, prote\u00edna, gordura e cinza, \n\nforam tamb\u00e9m quantificados 14 elementos considerados essenciais (c\u00e1lcio, cloro, cobre, \n\ncr\u00f3mio, enxofre, ferro, f\u00f3sforo, magn\u00e9sio, mangan\u00eas, n\u00edquel, pot\u00e1ssio, sel\u00e9nio, s\u00f3dio e zinco) e \n\nquatro considerados t\u00f3xicos (ars\u00e9nio, c\u00e1dmio, chumbo e merc\u00fario). No que se refere aos \n\nelementos t\u00f3xicos foram tamb\u00e9m analisadas algumas esp\u00e9cies de peixes de profundidade \n\n(cantarilho e peixe-espada preto), v\u00e1rios moluscos bivalves e algumas conservas de pescado. \n\nFoi ainda objectivo desta tese estimar o risco em fun\u00e7\u00e3o dos n\u00edveis de metil-merc\u00fario presente \n\nnos cefal\u00f3podes, ou seja, estimar a parte de uma determinada popula\u00e7\u00e3o em risco \n\n(probabilidade de exceder a dose toler\u00e1vel de ingest\u00e3o semanal de metil-merc\u00fario). \n\nForam utilizadas v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas para realizar as an\u00e1lises elementares - espectrometria de \n\nabsor\u00e7\u00e3o at\u00f3mica (chama, em fase de vapor frio e por combust\u00e3o directa), fluoresc\u00eancia de \n\nraios X por energia dispersiva (EDXRF) e espectrometria de absor\u00e7\u00e3o molecular (UV-Vis). Para \n\nquantificar as probabilidades de risco associadas ao consumo de cefal\u00f3podes, recorreu-se a \n\num tratamento matem\u00e1tico-estat\u00edstico, utilizando os valores de metil-merc\u00fario. \n\nDe um modo geral, os resultados obtidos demonstram que as esp\u00e9cies estudadas t\u00eam um \n\nelevado teor proteico e podem ser consideradas magras, \u00e0 excep\u00e7\u00e3o das esp\u00e9cies de \n\naquicultura que apresentaram teores de gordura superiores aos valores usuais nas cong\u00e9neres \n\nselvagens. \n\n\n\niii \n\nEm regra a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos elementos essenciais nas esp\u00e9cies estudadas era semelhante. \n\nOs elementos predominantes foram pot\u00e1ssio, cloro, enxofre, pot\u00e1ssio, s\u00f3dio, f\u00f3sforo, magn\u00e9sio \n\ne c\u00e1lcio seguidos do zinco, ferro, cobre, cr\u00f3mio, sel\u00e9nio, mangan\u00eas e n\u00edquel. No entanto, os \n\nperfis observados nos tr\u00eas cefal\u00f3podes e no lagostim diferiam do dos peixes. Assim, o pot\u00e1ssio \n\nera mais abundante nos peixes do que nas outras esp\u00e9cies e o teor de c\u00e1lcio foi mais elevado \n\nno crust\u00e1ceo, possivelmente devido ao processo de biomineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o da carapa\u00e7a. Tamb\u00e9m \n\nforam encontrados teores de zinco, cobre e ferro, mais elevados nos tr\u00eas cefal\u00f3podes e \n\ncrust\u00e1ceo do que nas esp\u00e9cies de aquicultura. O lagostim tamb\u00e9m apresentou n\u00edveis elevados \n\nde mangan\u00eas e de n\u00edquel. Estas diferen\u00e7as s\u00e3o devidas principalmente \u00e0s caracter\u00edsticas \n\nintr\u00ednsecas de cada esp\u00e9cie, habitats e dietas. Em geral, de entre os tr\u00eas cefal\u00f3podes, a lula foi \n\na que apresentou menores teores dos v\u00e1rios elementos essenciais. No que se refere aos \n\npeixes de aquicultura observou-se que o pregado revelou os menores teores da maioria dos \n\nminerais. Os resultados obtidos indicam que as diferentes esp\u00e9cies podem contribuir para as \n\ndoses di\u00e1rias recomendadas de v\u00e1rios elementos essenciais, como enxofre, f\u00f3sforo, zinco e \n\ncobre no caso dos cefal\u00f3podes e de f\u00f3sforo, zinco, cobre  magn\u00e9sio e sel\u00e9nio no lagostim. Por \n\nseu lado as esp\u00e9cies de aquicultura estudadas s\u00e3o uma boa fonte de f\u00f3sforo e pot\u00e1ssio. \n\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos elementos t\u00f3xicos, o universo das esp\u00e9cies foi alargado a peixes de \n\nprofundidade, moluscos bivalves e conservas de pescado, pelo facto de existir pouca \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a sua eventual contamina\u00e7\u00e3o e tamb\u00e9m serem importantes do ponto de vista \n\ndo consumo. Os n\u00edveis de ars\u00e9nio total no lagostim e no polvo eram elevados, no entanto, \n\ncomo cerca de 90 % deste elemento se encontra sob a forma org\u00e2nica nos organismos \n\nmarinhos, estas esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o constituem um perigo para o consumo humano. No que respeita \n\nao merc\u00fario total, os teores mais elevados foram encontrados no m\u00fasculo das esp\u00e9cies de \n\npeixes de profundidade, como o cantarilho e o peixe-espada-preto, excedendo alguns \n\nexemplares (70 % e 20 %, respectivamente), os limites propostos pela Uni\u00e3o Europeia. Este \n\nfacto decorre destas esp\u00e9cies terem uma grande longevidade, serem carn\u00edvoras e habitarem \n\nzonas que as podem predispor \u00e0 exposi\u00e7\u00e3o de contaminantes qu\u00edmicos. Tamb\u00e9m se \n\nverificaram para estas duas esp\u00e9cies correla\u00e7\u00f5es significativas entre os n\u00edveis de merc\u00fario total \n\ne alguns dados biom\u00e9tricos e regi\u00e3o de captura. O merc\u00fario org\u00e2nico representou no cantarilho \n\ne no peixe-espada-preto cerca de 86 % do merc\u00fario total o que indica que o consumo destas \n\nesp\u00e9cies deve ser parcimonioso (no m\u00e1ximo uma refei\u00e7\u00e3o por semana). Os n\u00edveis de merc\u00fario \n\ntotal encontrados no lagostim indicaram alguma contamina\u00e7\u00e3o, mas tendo em conta o baixo \n\nconsumo, per capita, desta esp\u00e9cie, n\u00e3o parece representar um risco para o consumidor \n\nportugu\u00eas. Os bivalves foram as esp\u00e9cies que apresentaram as menores concentra\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nm\u00e9dias de merc\u00fario total (&lt;0,05 mg/kg). Por seu lado, as conservas, reflectem o perfil das \n\nmat\u00e9rias-primas, assim, por exemplo, as de atum apresentaram valores m\u00e9dios mais elevados \n\nde merc\u00fario total (0,28 mg/kg) enquanto que nas de sardinha e de mexilh\u00e3o os valores m\u00e9dios \n\neram muito baixos (&lt;0,05 mg/kg), o que est\u00e1 de acordo com os valores habitualmente obtidos \n\npara estas esp\u00e9cies. \n\n\n\niv \n\nEm geral, os n\u00edveis de chumbo e de c\u00e1dmio foram, para todas as esp\u00e9cies e exemplares, \n\nsempre inferiores aos limites indicados pela Uni\u00e3o Europeia, sendo as de aquicultura as que \n\napresentaram os valores mais baixos (? 0,05 mg/kg). Contudo, existiram algumas excep\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nem amostras de moluscos, quer de bivalves quer de cefal\u00f3podes e em algumas conservas, \n\nnomeadamente nas de lula. Os teores mais elevados nos moluscos resultam n\u00e3o s\u00f3 da sua \n\nmorfologia mas tamb\u00e9m do tipo de habitat, como os estu\u00e1rios, que os tornam mais \n\npredispostos \u00e0 acumula\u00e7\u00e3o e concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de metais t\u00f3xicos como o c\u00e1dmio e o chumbo. \n\nAssim, o limite proposto pela Uni\u00e3o Europeia de 1,0 mg/kg para o c\u00e1dmio foi ultrapassado em \n\n10 % das amostras de cefal\u00f3podes, 18 % das amostras de conserva de lula e em 9 % de ostra \n\nportuguesa do estu\u00e1rio do Sado. Relativamente ao chumbo verificou-se que 50 % das \n\namostras de lambujinha do estu\u00e1rio do Tejo excederam o limite proposto pela Uni\u00e3o Europeia \n\n(1,5 mg/kg). \n\nNo sentido de avaliar o risco de ingest\u00e3o de metil-merc\u00fario atrav\u00e9s do consumo de \n\ncefal\u00f3podes em Portugal, foi estimada a probabilidade de ultrapassar a ingest\u00e3o semanal \n\ntoler\u00e1vel provis\u00f3ria desse composto pela combina\u00e7\u00e3o dos n\u00edveis de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o nos tr\u00eas \n\ncefal\u00f3podes estudados com a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de cen\u00e1rios de consumo ou com uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nhipot\u00e9tica do consumo para a popula\u00e7\u00e3o em geral portuguesa. Verificou-se que a lula n\u00e3o \n\napresenta nenhum problema de sa\u00fade com rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao metil-merc\u00fario, mas, para o choco e \n\npolvo, o consumo n\u00e3o deve exceder duas refei\u00e7\u00f5es por semana.  \n\nAtendendo aos resultados obtidos, esta tese corrobora a import\u00e2ncia de promover o \n\nconsumo dos produtos da pesca e da aquicultura, devido sobretudo ao seu elevado teor em \n\nprote\u00edna e em elementos essenciais suficientes para satisfazer as doses di\u00e1rias \n\nrecomendadas. No entanto, algumas esp\u00e9cies devem ser consumidas moderadamente, dados \n\nos valores de ingest\u00e3o semanal toler\u00e1vel provis\u00f3ria (PTWI) para os metais t\u00f3xicos \n\nrecomendados pela Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Mundial de Sa\u00fade e pela Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas \n\npara a Agricultura e Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o (WHO/FAO). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: produtos da pesca e aquicultura; macro e micro elementos essenciais; \n\nelementos t\u00f3xicos; avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de risco. \n\n\n\nv \n\nFOREWORD \n\n \n\nThis thesis is the result of a research project that was accomplished during the first years of \n\nthis century at INRB, I. P. / L-IPIMAR and FCUL. It is divided into two parts: the first contains \n\neight chapters and an annex and the second included nine scientific papers. The first chapter \n\ngives a brief general introduction of the world fisheries and the present situation in Portugal, in \n\nparticular about the species studied in this thesis. The aims appear in the second chapter. The \n\nthird chapter presents a background on the nutritional composition of seafood, particularly on \n\nthe essential and toxic elements, as well as about the risks and benefits regarding in the human \n\ndiet. The design of the study is presented in chapter four. All the methodologies used are \n\ndescribed in the chapter five. The main results, reported in detail in the second part of this \n\nthesis, are summarized in chapter six. The major conclusions and possible future research in \n\nthe same area of study are addressed in chapter seven. Finally, the references throughout the \n\ndocument are listed in the last chapter and in the Annex A, it is described the biology of all \n\nstudied seafood species. \n\nThe nine papers included in the second part are the result of the experimental work performed \n\non several seafood species: three cephalopods (cuttlefish, octopus and squid), one crustacean \n\n(Norway lobster), four farmed fish (gilthead seabream, European seabass, trout and turbot), two \n\ndeep-water fish (blackbelly rosefish and black scabbardfish), some bivalve molluscs and \n\ncanned seafood (details in design of the study). \n\nThe author wishes to state that the entire content of this thesis is of your responsibility, \n\nalthough, with papers in which it is co-author, it just attended a part. Thus, in the paper IV, \n\nanalysis of ?-tocopherol, as well as all data on the species Lophius spp., Aphanopus carbo and \n\nLepidorhombus spp were not their own. With respect to paper V, the levels of mercury were \n\nperformed by colleagues from the University of the Azores. Regarding paper VI, the author \n\nprovided data of mercury and methyl mercury and risk analysis was carried out by first author. \n\nIn the case of paper VII only data from the cephalopods, crustacean and gilthead seabream are \n\nof the author. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAbbreviations \n\n \n\n \n\nvi \n\nABBREVIATIONS \n\n \n\nAA  Azores Archipelago \n\nAAS  Atomic absorption spectrometry

According to Cave Painting \n\narchaeologies man caught the fish in the rivers and lakes or along the beaches by hand or with \n\nsmall instruments, or with rudimentary buildings armed in the sand (Thomazi, 1947). As the \n\nfisheries grew, there was a need to store and to maintain these products for longer periods \n\nwhich led to the concept of handling and storage. \n\nAncient civilizations like the Egyptian, Assyrian, Phoenician or Chinese were those that \n\ncontributed to major progress in activities related to fisheries. It is thought that the Egyptians \n\nwere the first to use salt as a process of preservation, the Phoenicians, for example, increased \n\nthe trade of fishery products, since they were great navigators and the Chinese have \n\ncontributed to a remarkable development in fisheries, using different fishing techniques \n\n(Thomazi, 1947). Later, in classic civilizations, the Greeks already had a great knowledge \n\nregarding the biology and behaviour of marine species and fishing technology. The main \n\nspecies consumed at that time was tuna, which was used as fresh, salted or marinated in oil. \n\nUpon extension of the Roman Empire there was a widespread of fishing methods in the \n\nMediterranean by the central and northern Europe. The strong sea trade regime between the \n\nvarious Roman colonies due to the sophisticated taste food of the Romans, led to the \n\ninstallation of tanks and ponds on board or in the case of transport by land, the use of ice or \n\nsnow, which caused the arrival of fresh fish products to the destination (Thomazi, 1947). \n\nIn the Middle Ages with the fall of the Roman Empire, there was an almost total \n\ndisappearance of industry and trade of fishery products in Europe, and this activity was only \n\nheld locally. The most important sites where the man preserved the techniques of fishing and \n\npreservation were the religious institutions. The main species caught at that time were herring \n\nand cod (Thomazi, 1947)  \n\nThe fisheries in international waters appeared in the sixteenth century and was strongly \n\ncontinued over the seventeenth after the improvement of boats and navigation techniques. Due \n\nto business expansion, the fisheries and trade of seafood products were developed. With the \n\ninvention of the steam engine and its application to fishing vessels from 1865, there was an \n\nincrease in the capture of cod and herring (Thomazi, 1947). The introduction of new materials in \n\nfisheries and the discovery of new methods of preservation based on the industrial production of \n\nice favoured a substantial development of the fisheries and trade dependent on it. In the early \n\ntwentieth century was an extraordinary increase in catches due to the introduction of \n\nmechanized fishing activity, that was then stopped over the first and second world wars, \n\nhowever several new technological applications have been enhanced fishing, during this period. \n\nThe appearance of the first steel ships using diesel, equipped with new facilities (more efficient \n\nnets, tracking devices, freezers) have allowed a better storage and processing of fishery \n\nproducts. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n2 \n\nRecently, the world total production of fish, crustaceans and molluscs has continued to \n\nincrease and in 2007, reached up to 140 million tonnes. Since 2001, capture production has \n\nstayed around 90 millions tonnes level and aquaculture production has continued to grow, \n\nattaining 50.3 million tonnes in 2007 (FAO, 2009). At the present, aquaculture is an important \n\nalternative to traditional forms of supplying the fishery products, According to Food and \n\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, for the year 2030, aquaculture will dominate the \n\nmarket and it is likely that less than half of fish products consumption will come from traditional \n\nfisheries (FAO, 2003). The most caught species at the global level has been the Peruvian \n\nanchoveta, Alaska Pollock, skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring and Chilean jack mackerel. Global \n\ncapture production of marine crustaceans and shell molluscs remained fairly stable, whereas \n\ntotal catch of cephalopods has continued its constant growth with an overall 35 percent increase \n\nduring the last 5 years (FAO, 2009). Among the most important farmed fish species in the \n\nEuropean Union are gilthead sea bream, European seabass, trout, turbot and salmon and even \n\nshellfish such as mussels, clams and oysters, whose production has been increasing in recent \n\nyears and are often sold whole and fresh. About 81 percent of total fishery production (113.7 \n\nmillion tonnes in 2007) was used for direct human consumption. The remaining 19 percent were \n\ndestined for non-food products, mainly for the manufacture of fishmeal and fish oil (FAO, 2009). \n\nIn Figure 1.1 it can be observed the evolution of World fish utilization and supply. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Evolution of World fish utilization and supply. (Source: FAO, 2009). \n\n \n\n1.2 Fish consumption in Portugal \n\nPortugal presents a privileged position comparing to the other European countries due to its \n\ngeo-strategic front to the Atlantic Ocean, and the accumulated knowledge of generations of \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n3 \n\npractical and technical catch of marine species, their preservation and processing and use as \n\nfood. With an exclusive economic zone currently around 170,0000 Km\n2\n and a coastline of 2,830 \n\nkm on the mainland and two island areas, the fishing has been always an important source of \n\nlivelihood, especially for coastal communities, many of which are almost totally dependent on \n\nfisheries and other related activities (DGPA, 2007 a, b). \n\nIn 2009, 144,792 tonnes of seafood, were landed in Portugal (Figure 1.2), which were \n\nunloaded as fresh or refrigerated in the auctions, accounting for a decrease of 14.9 % relatively \n\nto 2008 (INE, 2010). Behind this decrease was decisively the lower catch of marine fish (sardine \n\nand mackerel) and cephalopods, especially octopuses (INE, 2010). Relatively to crustaceans \n\nthere was a rise due to an increase in the catch of shrimps (INE, 2010). Total aquaculture \n\nproduction in 2008 reached to 7,987 tonnes (Figure 1.3). This value implies an increase from \n\nthe previous year of about 7.3 % of total. The production has been focusing on European \n\nseabass, gilthead sea bream and clam in sea water and trout in fresh water. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nQuantity Value \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Landings (tonnes and value) of fresh/chilled fish in Portuguese ports (2007-\n\n2009).

It should be noted that for example in Iceland this consumption is estimated at more or \n\nless 90 kg while in the United States is less than 25 kg. While it has seen in recent years the \n\nincrease of meat consumption, it is expected that in future, the consumption of fishery products \n\nwill grow due to diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and foot-and-\n\nmouth disease (FMD) in meat. Moreover, a growing number of consumers prefer these products \n\nto consider that they are an healthier alternative to meat consumption or by dietary choices \n\nrelated to an easier digestibility. Fishery products fulfil an important role in human nutrition and \n\nthey have economic advantages. The nutritional benefits originate in their valuable proteins, \n\nhigh content of ?3 fatty acids, low cholesterol level, mineral profile and contents as well as in \n\nsome vitamins (Belitz et al., 2004; Simopoulos, 1997; Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997).  \n\n \n\n1.3 Importance of species used in this study \n\nFrom an economic point of view, some species are interesting due to the large quantities \n\navailable at the moment and also because they are much appreciated in Portuguese cuisine. \n\nAmong these species can stand out the cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish), some \n\nspecies of shellfish or black scabbardfish. Currently, farmed fish are also very important in the \n\nPortuguese economy mainly because they are highly valued species but at a lower price when \n\ncompared to the same species of wildlife habitat. The most appreciated farmed fish are gilthead \n\nseabream and European seabass. Another fishery product very appreciated in Portugal are \n\ncanned fish such as tuna or sardines in various sauces.  \n\nAlthough, there is a huge amount of data available in seafood, most studies are concerned to \n\nNorth Atlantic or Mediterranean species. Regarding species and products in Portugal such as \n\ncephalopods, bivalves, deep-water species, farmed fish species as well canned products the \n\navailable data it is not so abundant. Therefore, to ameliorate the seafood composition database, \n\nto better inform the consumers, data of that seafood are needed. Thus, this work focused on the \n\nvarious species described above, in particular, three cephalopods (cuttlefish, squid, octopus), a \n\ncrustacean (Norway lobster), two deep-water fish (blackbelly rosefish and black scabbardfish) \n\nand four farmed fish (gilthead seabream, European seabass, trout and turbot). Also have been \n\nstudied several species of bivalves molluscs produced in Portugal and some canned seafood. \n\nAccording to Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica (INE) (2010), in 2009, the most important wild \n\nspecies studied in the present work present about 15 % of the total seafood landed in Portugal \n\n(Figure 1.4). With respect to farmed fish studied in this work, they present about 50 % of the \n\ntotal produced in 2008 in Portugal (Figure 1.5). Bivalve molluscs represent about 2 % of the \n\nseafood landed and about 49 % of the total produced in aquaculture in 2008 (Figure 1.6). In \n\nwhat concerns average production of canned seafood in Portugal, the number is situated \n\naround 40, 000 tonnes, since 2001, being the most relevant canned sardine and canned tuna \n\n(Figure 1.7).  \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n5 \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n\nYe ar\n\nS\ne\n\na\nfo\n\no\nd\n\n l\na\n\nn\nd\n\ne\nd\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n(1\n0\n\n3\n t\n\no\nn\n\nn\ne\n\ns\n)\n\nBlackbelly rosefish Black scabbardfish Cuttlefish\n\nOctopus Squid Norway lobster\n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 Studied seafood species landed in Portugal (Source: INE, 2002 - 2010). \n\n \n\n0,0\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\n1,5\n\n2,0\n\n2,5\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\n\nYear\n\nA\nq\n\nu\na\n\nc\nu\n\nlt\nu\n\nre\n p\n\nro\nd\n\nu\nc\n\nti\no\n\nn\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\n(1\n0\n\n3\n t\n\no\nn\n\nn\ne\n\ns\n)\n\nGilthead seabream Seabass Trout Turbot\n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 \u2013 Some of the most representative farmed fish produced in Portugal, since 2001. \n\n(Source: INE, 2002 - 2010). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n6 \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\n\nB\niv\n\na\nlv\n\ne\ns\n\n (\n1\n\n0\n3\n T\n\no\nn\n\nn\ne\n\ns\n)\n\nBivalves Aquaculture bivalves\n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 \u2013 Bivalve molluscs in Portugal, since 2001.

In addition, the levels of \n\ncadmium, mercury and lead were also studied in deep-water fish, bivalve molluscs and \n\ncanned seafood products; \n\n \n\n\u2022 To quantify the probabilities of risks associated to seafood products consumption in \n\nPortugal and methyl-mercury contents, using cephalopods as model. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n8 \n\n3 BACKGROUND \n3.1 Proximate composition and nutritional value of seafood \n\nThe knowledge of seafood proximate composition is a key aspect to assess their nutritional \n\nvalue. However, this composition varies among species and depends on age and sex of \n\nindividuals, as well as the environment and the spawning season. This is observed in wild fish \n\nfrom open sea or inland waters. The farmed fish also presents variations on proximate \n\ncomposition, having factors such as diet composition, environment, fish size and genetic \n\ncharacteristics an impact on the composition (Huss, 1995). Seafood meat is readily digestible \n\nas mammals but seafood is digested substantially faster than mammal ones and has therefore \n\na much lower nutritive saturation value (Belitz et al., 2004). Like other food products, seafood \n\ncontains water, proteins and non protein-nitrogen compounds, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins \n\nand minerals. Apart from water, proteins and lipids are the major constituents while \n\ncarbohydrates are the minor ones, although in molluscs can attained 5 %. Table 3.1 presents \n\nthe proximate composition of some of the most consumed species in Portugal. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 Proximate composition (g) and energy value (kcal/kJ) of some seafood species (100 \n\ng of edible portion).

Within the same species water and fat contents are inversely related \n\nconstituting around 80 % of seafood edible portion (Huss, 1995). This constituent plays a key \n\nrole as a solvent for organic and inorganic solutes, and is an integral part in most of the \n\nreactions, having a major impact on the conformation and reactivity of proteins. Changes in the \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n9 \n\namount of water present in the muscle affect their rheological properties, nutritional value and \n\nsensory quality. These changes affect the shelf life of fish (Sikorski et al., 1990). \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Proteins and other non protein nitrogen compounds \n\nAs a rule, seafood contains 17-20 % of crude protein corresponding to 2-3 % of protein \n\nnitrogen (Nunes et al., 2003) These percentages are rather constant in most species although \n\nsome variations can occurred during spawning (Huss, 1995). The proteins in seafood muscle \n\ntissue can be divided into the following three groups:  \n\n\u2022 Structural proteins (ex: actin, myosin, tropomyosins), which constitute 70-80 % of the \n\ntotal protein content. These proteins are soluble in neutral salt solutions of fairly high \n\nionic strength (0.5 M); \n\n\u2022 Sarcoplasmic proteins (myoalbumin, globulin and enzymes), which constitute 25-30% \n\nof the total protein. These proteins are soluble in neutral , salt solutions of low ionic \n\nstrength (&lt;0.15 M); \n\n\u2022 Connective tissue proteins (collagen and elastin), which constitute approximately 3 % \n\nof the protein in teleosts fishes and about 10 % in elasmobranches (Huss, 1995; Belitz \n\net al., 2004). \n\nThe proteins of fishery products have a high biological value because they have all essential \n\namino acids and is also recognized its great digestibility. They play a key role in the growth and \n\nmaintenance of vital bodily functions (Nunes et al., 2008). In Table 3.2 it can be observed the \n\naminoacid profile of some species of seafood. Proteins collectively influence all the seafood \n\nsensorial attributes (colour, flavour, texture), and the post harvest deterioration of seafood meat. \n\nThese compounds in seafood meat are also important because they contribute to chemical and \n\nphysical changes during its processing (Haard, 1995). \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 - Essential aminoacid composition (g) of some seafood species (100 g of edible \n\nportion).

The \n\nmajor classes of sarcoplasmic components are free amino acids, peptides, guanidine \n\ncompounds, urea, nucleotides and quaternary ammonium compounds. These compounds are \n\nimportant because they influence the delicate taste of seafood and they contribute to the \n\nspoilage of fishery products (Simopoulos, 1997). \n\n \n\n3.1.3 Lipids \n\nThe fat content can vary between 0.1 % and about 30 %. According to Belitz et al. (2004) \n\nseafood can be classified in lean (0.1 - 0.4 % of lipids), fatty (? 16 %) and semi fatty (0.4 % &lt;\n\nlipids &lt;16 %). Generally, lean fish store lipids mostly in the liver and the fatty ones store in fat \n\ncells distributed in other body tissues. Semi-fatty species store lipids in limited parts of their \n\nbody tissues only, or in lower quantities than classic fatty species. Typical lean species are the \n\nbottom-dwelling ground fish like cod, saithe and hake. Fatty species include the pelagic like \n\nherring, mackerel and sardine. Mullet, tuna and swordfish can be considered semi-fatty species. \n\nDespite of this classification, seafood is generally regard as a low fat food. The majority of \n\nseafood species contain less than 2.5 % of total fat, and only a short number of species has \n\nmore than 16 %. The fat content of seafood is strongly influenced by season, geographical area \n\nand age. Hence, lipid content tends to be higher when fish are intensively feeding, frequently \n\nduring summer period (northern hemisphere), and in older and healthier specimens. In addition, \n\nfat contents tend to be lower during spawning or reproduction and when food is less abundant \n\n(Nunes et al., 2003). Another important fact is that the dark muscle is fattier than the white one. \n\nThis different lipid composition is related to the biological adaptation of different species, white \n\nmuscle is used, particularly in sudden movements, while the dark is used in constant \n\nmovement. Thus, species that show white muscle do not make major shifts to feed or reproduce \n\n(lower energy consumption), contrary to what happens to species that have dark muscle that \n\nutilize constant movement to achieve the same objectives, which implies increased energy \n\nconsumption (Huss, 1995). \n\nThe lipids present in seafood species may be divided into major groups: the phospholipids \n\nand the triacylglycerols. The phospholipids make up the integral structure of the unit \n\nmembranes in the cells, frequently called structural lipids. The triacylglycerols are lipids used for \n\nstorage of energy in fat depots, usually within special fat cells surrounded by a phospholipids' \n\nmembrane and a rather weak collagen network. Fatty fish lipids are constituted especially by \n\ntriacylglycerols, whereas in lean fish the phospholipids are almost 90 % of the total lipids in \n\nmuscle (Huss, 1995). \n\n \n\n3.1.3.1 Fatty acids \n\nSeafood lipids are composed by a wide variety of saturated, monounsaturated and \n\npolyunsaturated fatty acids (consists of a chain of carbon atoms with a carboxyl group at one \n\nend and a methyl group at the other) (Figure 3.1), being the percentage of fatty acids with 20 or  \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Structure of some polyunsaturated fatty acids. (Picture source site: Nephropal, 2009)  \n\n \n\nmore carbon atoms and more than four double bonds significantly higher than that found in \n\nvegetable oils and in mammalian fat (Huss, 1995). Many of these compounds belong to the \n\nomega-3 fatty acids family. Fish and shellfish ingest and accumulate such compounds through \n\nthe food chain from algae and phytoplankton, which are the primary producers (Nunes et al., \n\n2003). The proportion and amounts of saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated and omega-3 fatty \n\nacids vary considerably from one species to another, and in farmed species is strongly \n\ndependent on the diet. As a rule, the fattier seafood contains more omega-3 fatty acids than the \n\nleaner. In human nutrition fatty acids such as linoleic and linolenic acid are regarded as \n\nessential since they cannot be synthesized by the organism. In seafood, these fatty acids \n\nconstitute only around 2 % of the total lipids, which is a small percentage when compared with \n\nmany vegetables oils (Huss, 1995). However, fish oils contain other polyunsaturated fatty acids \n\nwhich are also considered essential. The most important omega-3 fatty acids found in seafood \n\nare eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) that are beneficial to health. \n\nThe effects of fish consumption on growth and development and in health and disease have \n\nbeen extensively studied in human life. Epidemiologic studies, clinical investigations, animal \n\nexperiments, and in vitro studies have been carried out to determine the role of omega-3 fatty \n\nacids in coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, \n\nulcerative colitis and other autoimmune disorders with encouraging results (Simopoulos, 1997, \n\nKolakowska et al., 2003). Some of the typical values in the species most consumed in Portugal \n\nare found in Table 3.3. \n\n \n\n3.1.4 Carbohydrates \n\nThe carbohydrate content in muscle of fresh fish is insignificant (&lt;0.3 - 0.5 %) and generally \n\nlower than in mammalian muscle tissue (Belitz et al., 2004); however, certain shellfish store \n\nsome of their energy reserves as glycogen, which contributes to the characteristic sweet taste \n\nof their products. Some bivalve molluscs contain 3-5 % glycogen while lobsters have around 1 \n\n% (Simopoulos, 1997). \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n12 \n\nTable 3.3 - Total fat, total of polynsaturated and EPA and DHA fatty acids in some seafood \n\nspecies (g of 100 g of edible portion).

In farmed fish the contents of vitamins reflect the composition of the \n\ncorresponding components in the fish feed. Therefore, the vitamin content of wild and farmed \n\nfish can be different (Rehbein &amp; Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2009). According to the solubility of the \n\nvitamins, they are grouped into fat soluble and water soluble. In the first group are included the \n\nvitamins A, D and E, while in the latter are included the B complex vitamins. The levels of \n\nvitamin B are comparable to those found in many other foods with high protein content; some \n\nfatty species can be a reasonable source of vitamins A and D, although most fish species is not \n\nconsidered to be a good source of fat-soluble vitamins (Nunes et al., 2003). Also present are \n\nvitamins E and K. Vitamin E, which is present in foods in different forms, is presented in seafood \n\nmainly as ?-tocopherol that is the most efficient natural antioxidant in living organisms. This \n\nvitamin is found in significant amounts in seafood species that can provide about 15% of the \n\nrecommended daily dose. Besides its role in prevention of lipid oxidation is also known its \n\nantioxidative action in the oxidative stress reactions originated by the rupture of mercury organic \n\nforms in target organs, being its action synergetic with selenium. In this type of food there is little \n\nvitamin C. In Table 3.4 it can be found mean levels of vitamins A, D and E in some seafood \n\nspecies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n13 \n\nTable 3.4 - Mean levels of vitamins A, D and E in some seafood species (100 g of edible \n\nportion).

In a simplified \n\ndefinition, essential elements are elements which are necessary required for the maintenance of \n\nlife (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997). The major constituents of their body tissues are some bulk \n\nstructural elements, present in amounts of percents, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, \n\nsulphur (S) and phosphorus (P). In addition, five macro elements, potassium (K), sodium (Na), \n\nchloride (Cl), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) are present in gram per kilogram quantities. \n\nThe remaining elements occur in seafood in much lower concentrations (mg or \u00b5g per kilogram \n\nquantities), like the trace elements copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) and the ultra trace \n\nelements like fluoride (F), iodine (I), selenium (Se), silicon (Si), manganese (Mn), molybdenum \n\n(Mo), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni). All these elements are \n\nconsidered essential for human and animal life. Other elements presented in seafood are \n\nbromine (Br), strontium (Sr) and rubidium (Rb). They have also been claimed essential, but the \n\nphysiological functions of these trace elements have not been clearly demonstrated or remain to \n\nbe confirmed. The main functions of essential elements include formation of skeletal structure, \n\nmaintenance of colloidal systems and regulation of acid-base equilibrium. They are important \n\ncomponents of hormones, enzymes and enzyme activators (Lall, 1995). Generally, species \n\nhave  the  following  descending  order  of  concentration:  K>P>Na>Mg>Ca>Zn>Fe>Cu>Mn. In \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n14 \n\nTable 3.5 it can be observed mean levels of some essential elements in various seafood \n\nspecies. \n\n \n\nTable 3.5 - Mean levels of some essential elements in various seafood species (mg per 100 g \n\nof edible portion).

On the other hand, some elements like cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and \n\nmercury (Hg) show no known essential function in life and are toxic even at low concentration \n\nwhen ingested over a long period; therefore many consumers regard any presence of these \n\nelements in seafood as a hazard to health. These elements were present in the aquatic \n\nenvironment long before human beings existed (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2002). Others can be toxic in \n\na determined chemical form or presented varied toxicity depending on biological system \n\n(Fra\u00fasto da Silva, 1985). As the other seafood components, minerals concentration is species-\n\nspecific and can furthermore vary with biological aspects (size, age, sex, state of maturity) but \n\nalso with diet, season and the environment. Most aquatic organisms accumulate and retain \n\nminerals from the environment. In what concerns farmed fish, the composition of commercial \n\nfeeds used also influences their elemental composition. \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Essential elements \n\n3.2.1.1 Macro elements \n\nElectrolytes (K, Na and Cl) \n\nSodium and Cl are the principal extracellular cation and anion, respectively, in the human \n\nbody. Sodium is important in osmoregulation, acid-base balance and the membrane potential of \n\ncells, as well active transport across cell membranes (Lall, 1995). In addition, it activates some \n\nenzymes, such as amylase (Belitz et al., 2004). Chloride is essential in the maintenance of \n\nelectrolyte balance and is also the most important anion in gastric juice (Lall, 1995). In diets, Cl \n\nand Na are necessary in equivalent levels on a molar basis. Potassium is localized mostly \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n15 \n\nwithin the cells. It regulates the osmotic pressure within the cell, is involved in cell membrane \n\ntransport and also in the activation of a number of glycolytic and respiratory enzymes (Belitz et \n\nal., 2004). According to Institute of Medicine (IOM) (2005), in average, the dietary reference \n\nintake (DRI) for these three elements are 1500 mg/day for Na, 4700 mg/day for K and 2300 \n\nmg/day for Cl. The intake of too little or too much of these three elements can result in serious \n\ndisorders. From a nutritional point of view an excessive dose of Na is more plausible than its \n\ndeficiency. Somme symptoms caused by an high consumption of Na are hypertension, \n\nweakness and edema (IOM, 2004). Chloride deficiency or excess are associated to Na. \n\nGenerally, a deficiency of K do not show symptoms but a severe deficiency of this element can \n\ncause hypokalemia, characterized by muscle weakness, cardiac arritmia and glucose \n\nintolerance. An excess may enhance the appearance of hyperkalemia (IOM, 2004). \n\nPotassium is the most abundant mineral in seafood (Lall, 1995) and its concentration is \n\nalways higher than that of Na (Belitz et al., 2004). Since the level of Na in seafood is relatively \n\nlow, this kind of food is good for those consumers who need a low Na diet (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, \n\n1997, Martinez-Valverde et al., 2000). Levels of K in marine fish are around 3500 mg/kg, \n\nhowever some species can reach 5000 mg/kg (Lall, 1995). Shellfish show the lowest K values, \n\nfor example shrimps only attained a mean concentration of 1790 mg/kg (Nunes et al., 2008). \n\nWide variations in the Na content of fishery products can be observed. Freshwater and marine \n\nfish present a Na average of 600 mg/kg while most shellfish have Na in the range of 1200-4000 \n\nmg/kg. Data on distribution of Cl in seafood are scarce (Lall, 1995). In the study performed by \n\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger (1997) on16 marine fish species from the North-East Atlantic, the levels were in \n\nthe range of 400-1300 mg/kg. \n\n \n\nStructural elements (P and S) \n\nPhosphorous is an integral part of bone and tooth mineral as well as part of the structure of \n\nevery cell (Pigott &amp; Tucker, 1990). It is directly involved in energy-producing cellular reactions. \n\nTherefore, P plays an important role in overall metabolism as well as in various metabolic \n\nprocesses involving buffers in body fluids (Lall, 1995). Sulphur it is especially important for \n\nhumans because it is part of the amino acid methionine, which is an absolute dietary \n\nrequirement. The amino acid cysteine also contains S. This element also plays an important \n\nrole in the health effects production of insulin, which keeps the blood sugar levels balanced. \n\nAccording to IOM (2005), in average, DRI for P is 700 mg/day. Dietary reference intake for S is \n\nabout 800-1000 mg/day (Acu-cell Nutrition, 2010a). As P and S are found in most foods, \n\ndeficiencies are uncommon. \n\nThe best source of P and S are high-protein foods such as seafood. In general, the content of \n\nP in seafood is around 2000 mg/kg. Usually, equal amounts of these two elements were found \n\nin marine species (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997). Data collected by some authors (Lall, 1995; \n\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997; Nunes et al., 2008) show a P mean concentration range of 1400-3000 \n\nmg/kg being the small fatty pelagic fish the best source. \n\n \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n16 \n\nCalcium and Magnesium (Ca and Mg) \n\nApproximately 99 % of Ca is present in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite. The \n\nremaining portions of Ca are found in extracellular fluids and intracellular structures and cell \n\nmembranes. Calcium is involved in the structure of the muscular system and controls essential \n\nprocesses like muscle contraction, blood clotting, activity of brain cells and cell growth (Belitz et \n\nal., 2004). The distribution of Mg is similar to the distribution of Ca and P, the major proportion is \n\nbeing located in bone. The remainder is found within the cells of soft tissues (Lall, 1995). \n\nMagnesium is a prosthetic group in enzymes that hydrolyse and transfer phosphate groups. \n\nConsequently, it is essential for energy-requiring biological functions such as membrane \n\ntransport, generation and transmission of nerve impulses, contraction of muscles and oxidative \n\nphosphorylation. It is also essential for the maintenance of ribosomal structure and thus protein \n\nsynthesis (Lall, 1995). According to IOM (2005), in average, the DRI for these two elements are \n\n1000 mg/day for Ca and 420 mg/day for Mg. Symptoms of Ca deficiency are bone weakness, \n\nneuromuscular excitability and muscle spasms. Calcium excess can provoke kidney stones. \n\nMagnesium deficiency can cause neuromuscular irritability, muscle spasms and cardiovascular \n\naccidents. Furthermore, an excess of Mg can cause diarrhoea, anaesthesia and depression of \n\ncentral and peripheral nervous system (Fra\u00fasto da Silva, 1985). \n\nDespite of seafood muscle are considered poor source of these two elements, generally, \n\nseafood contains more Mg than Ca (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997). The average concentrations of Ca \n\nin most fish and shellfish muscle are in general inferior to 400 mg/kg but some species show \n\nwide differences due to variable amounts of bone and shell. Crustaceans contain more Ca than \n\nfish (Lall, 1995). The concentrations of Mg in the edible portion of most seafood ranged \n\nbetween 200 - 500 mg/kg. However, molluscs and crustaceans can showed levels around 2000 \n\nmg/kg of Mg (Jodral-Segado et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2 Trace elements  \n\nCopper (Cu) \n\nCopper is a component of a number of oxidoreductase enzymes. As a cofactor for enzymes it \n\nis involved in glucose metabolism and the synthesis of haemoglobin, connective tissue and \n\nphospholipids (Lall, 1995). In blood plasma, it is bound to ceruloplasmin, which catalyzes the \n\noxidation of Fe\n2+\n\n to Fe\n3+\n\n. This reaction is of great importance since it is only the Fe\n3+\n\n form in \n\nblood which is transported by the transferrin protein to the iron pool in the liver (Belitz et al., \n\n2004). Copper can have toxic effects in all alive organisms; however, it is not toxic for humans \n\nat low concentrations (Celik &amp; Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2004). The average DRI for Cu is 0.9 mg/day \n\n(IOM, 2005). This value is normally supplied in a normal diet. A deficient diet in Cu may cause in \n\nhumans, anaemia, Menke's syndrome in children, deficient keratinisation and pigmentation \n\n(insufficient production of melamine). An excess, in turn, can cause, among other problems, \n\nWilson's disease, hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis and haemolytic crises (Fra\u00fasto da Silva, 1985). \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n17 \n\nThe overall concentration of Cu in most seafood is around 2 mg/kg, with the exception of \n\nmolluscs and crustaceans where the concentration can attain average values of 10 mg/kg, in \n\ncrabs, or 80 mg/kg in oysters (Lall, 1995). \n\nIron (Fe) \n\nIron is present in all cells of living organisms and plays a vital role in several biochemical \n\nreactions. Most of Fe is present in the haemoglobin (blood) and myoglobin (muscle tissues) \n\npigments, cytochromes and other proteins, participating in the transport, storage and utilization \n\nof oxygen (Lall,1995). This element is also present in a number of enzymes (peroxidase, \n\ncatalase, hydroxilases and flavine enzymes), therefore is an essential element of the daily diet \n\n(Belitz et al., 2004). According to IOM (2005), in average, the DRI for this element is 8 mg/day, \n\nhowever, in order to provide a sufficient supply of Fe to persons who require higher amounts \n\n(children, women before menopause and pregnant or nursing women), the Fe DRI can reached \n\nup to 27 mg/day. Iron deficiency causes anaemia. On the other hand, hemochromatosis and \n\nthalassemia involve an excessive storage of iron probably caused by an excessive intake of \n\nsupplements. Symptoms of acute toxicity are vomiting, diarrhoea and intestinal problems (Curry \n\n&amp; Liu, 2010). \n\nTotal content of Fe in seafood can vary greatly. Usually, Fe fish concentrations are lower than \n\n10 mg/kg. Nevertheless, fish species with a high amount of dark muscle, as pelagic ones \n\n(sardine, mackerel, tuna, etc.), contain more Fe than others fish species, attaining 30 mg/kg, \n\ndue to the high level of Fe in dark muscle (Lall, 1995). Species like crustaceans can also have \n\namounts higher than 10 mg/kg (Lall, 1995). \n\nZinc (Zn) \n\nZinc is an essential element for humans. Its essential function is based on its role as an \n\nintegral part of a number of metalloenzymes and as a catalyst for regulating the activity of \n\nspecific zinc-dependent enzymes (Lall, 1995). According to IOM (2005), in average, the DRI for \n\nthis element is 8 mg/day. A deficient diet in Zn can lead to the occurrence of diseases such as \n\nanorexia, stunting, parakeratosis, alopecia, hypogonadism, and delayed healing. On the other \n\nhand an excess of Zn can cause metal fume fever (fever, chills) (Fra\u00fasto da Silva, 1985). Zinc \n\npoisoning has been reported as a result of consumption of soured food kept in zinc-plated-metal \n\ncontainers (Belitz et al., 2004). \n\nThis element is present in fish and other seafood in mg/kg amounts and there have been no \n\nreports of concentrations in the edible parts of seafood that form a hazard to health \n\n(Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2002). In general, fish have low Zn contents when compared to molluscs and \n\ncrustaceans. Fish muscle has an average of about 3-5 mg/kg of zinc, while molluscs and \n\ncrustaceans can reach much higher values. Oysters for example can display average values of \n\n850 mg/kg (Lall, 1995). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n18 \n\n3.2.1.3 Ultra trace elements  \n\nChromium (Cr) \n\nChromium is considered an essential nutrient for humans. It may have a role in activating \n\nenzymes and in maintaining the structural stability of proteins and nucleic acids, but the primary \n\nphysiological role of Cr is to enhance insulin action (Lall, 1995; Vincent, 2004) by activating the \n\nenzyme phosphoglucomutase (Belitz et al., 2004). Trivalent Cr and its salts are usually the most \n\nstable form of Cr and the main form found in plants and animals (FDA, 1993a). The hexavalent \n\nCr salts are less stable and more biologically reactive. This last form causes allergic reactions \n\nand has neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects (Racek, 2003). According to IOM (2005), in \n\naverage, the DRI for this element is 35 \u00b5g/day. This value can be surpassed with a diet in \n\nseafood however, in agreement to Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) (Hathcock, 2004) Cr \n\nsupplements at levels up to 1,000 \u00b5g per day are regarded as safe for adults. The symptoms of \n\nCr deficiency caused by long-term total parenteral nutrition are severely impaired glucose \n\ntolerance, a loss of weight, and confusion. Because of the high excretion rates and the very low \n\nabsorption rates of most forms of Cr, acute toxicity is uncommon. \n\nThe Cr content in fish was reported to be between 0.02 and 0.5 mg/kg (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, \n\n1997). However, levels as high as 5 or 12 mg/kg have been found in molluscs and crustacean \n\nedible tissues (Lall, 1995). Generally, the edible part of the muscle contains lower levels of Cr \n\nthan liver and other organs. \n\nManganese (Mn) \n\nOne of the functions of Mn is as a cofactor activating a large number of enzymes such as \n\narginase, amino peptidase, alkaline phosphatase, lecithinase or enolase (Belitz et al., 2004). \n\nSince the chemistry of Mn ion is similar to that of the Mg ion, many enzymes can be activated \n\nby either Mn or Mg however, certain enzymes, for example, glycosyl tansferases are highly \n\nspecific for Mn activation (Lall, 1995). Manganese can also be an integral part of some \n\nmetalloenzymes (for example pyruvate oxidase) (Fra\u00fasto da Silva, 1985). Moreover, Mn is also \n\nnecessary in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and brain function (Lall, 1995). According to \n\nIOM (2005), in average, the DRI for Mn is 1.8 mg/day. Only a small part of Mn is absorved by \n\ndiet (IOM, 2001) and even in higher amounts, Mn is relatively non toxic (Belitz et al., 2004). \n\nHowever, an excessive intake can lead to mental disorders (manganese madness) (Fra\u00fasto da \n\nSilva, 1985). Its deficiency can cause bone deformities, sterility and ataxia. \n\nSeafood is not a good source of Mn and is considered a minor component (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, \n\n1997). Most muscle fish contain 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg (Lall, 1995), nonetheless molluscs and \n\ncrustaceans contain significantly higher levels than fish (Lall, 1995). Subsequently, seafood only \n\ncontributes to the DRI with a minor percentage. \n\nNickel (Ni) \n\nNickel is an essential nutrient that is only required in very small amountsThis metal is present in \n\nsome biologic molecules such as enzymes urease and CO dehydrogenase (Fra\u00fasto da Silva, \n\n1985). Nickel also enhances insulin activity (Belitz et al., 2004). Its absorption into the body is \n\naffected by factors of consumption, the acidity of the gut, and various binding or competing \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n19 \n\nsubstances, including other minerals such as Ca, Fe, Mg and Zn (Curry &amp; Liu, 2010). According \n\nto IOM (2005), in average, the DRI for this element is 0.5 mg/day. Nickel deficiency is rare due \n\nto the low level of requirement, and its relatively high availability in the diet, but experiments \n\nhave shown that at a cellular level, Ni deprivation results in changes in the membrane \n\nproperties and other structures. Deficiency has also been associated with low blood glucose \n\nlevels, abnormal bone growth, altered metabolism of Ca and vitamin B12 and poor absorption of \n\nferric iron (Curry &amp; Liu, 2010). Nickel toxicity is usually not a problem unless several grams are \n\ningested from non-dietary sources. The toxicity of Ni is classified into four categories: allergies, \n\ncancer, non-malignant respiratory disorders and iatrogenic poisoning (FDA, 1993b).  \n\nFor the common population the major source of Ni is the diet. Nickel is widely distributed in \n\nfoods. The concentration of Ni in seafood varies, depending of species and polluted or non-\n\npolluted catch area. In general, molluscs and crustaceans have higher values than fish species. \n\nLevels can range from 0.02 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg (Carvalho et al., 2005; Sivaperumal et al., 2007). \n\nSelenium (Se) \n\nSelenium is recognized both as an essential trace element and a toxic agent. It is an integral \n\ncomponent of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH) (selenoprotein) in human and animal \n\ntissues, which, together with vitamin E and the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, \n\nacts as an antioxidant, thereby protecting cells against oxidative damage (Lall, 1995). It is also \n\ninvolved in thyroid metabolism through iodothyroninedeiodinase enzyme and is needed for the \n\nproper functioning of the immune system (Sirichakwal et al., 2005). The presence of Se reduces \n\nthe availability of metal ions (such as mercury and cadmium), blocking them in insoluble \n\ncompounds, which is a process of great importance (Lall, 1995; Plessi et al., 2001; Feroci et al., \n\n2005). As a result, a deficiency of Se increases the toxicity caused by those metals. In addition, \n\nSe deficiency has been reported to cause an overload of Fe and unbalanced distributions of \n\nother elements in vivo, such as Mg, Ca, Cu and Zn (Feroci et al., 2005). On the other hand, \n\nexcessive ingestion or inhalation of Se can be toxic to man and animals, although in humans its \n\noccurrence is rare. The symptoms include depression, nervousness, and dermatitis, garlic \n\nodour of the breath, gastrointestinal disturbances, and excessive tooth decay (Sivaperumal et \n\nal., 2007). According to IOM (2005), the average DRI for this element is 55 \u00b5g/day. \n\nSeafood contains substantially higher levels of Se than red meats and poultry and is thus \n\nconsidered one of the major dietary sources of this element in addition to cereal and dried fruit \n\n(Lall, 1995). Among seafood, marine fish are the best source. The Se content is quite constant \n\nand varies little between species (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997). Reported values are about 0.2 \u2013 1.0 \n\nmg/kg (Lall, 1995; Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997; Carvalho et al., 2005; Sirichakwal et al., 2005; Garg &amp; \n\nRamakrishna, 2006; Sivaperumal et al., 2007). Dietary reference intake can be easily reached \n\nin a normal seafood diet. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n20 \n\n3.2.2 Non-essential elements? \n\n3.2.2.1 Bromine (Br) \n\nBromine is one of the most abundant and ubiquitous within the recognized trace elements in \n\nthe biosphere. This element has not been conclusively shown to perform any essential function \n\nin plants, microrganisms and animals (Pavelka, 2004) since not enough information is available \n\nabout the metabolism of bromide ion, the most common form of this element. However, \n\ninorganic bromide can exert both therapeutic as well as the toxic effects (Pavelka, 2004). It is \n\nproved that in thyroid gland, bromide replace iodide (Pavelka, 2004). In this way, seafood that \n\nare a source of bromine and iodine, and depending on their bromine/iodine ratio and whether \n\nsomeone is hypothyroid or hyperthyroid, it can have beneficial or unfavourable effect on thyroid \n\nfunctions when regularly consumed. There is no DRI established for Br, nevertheless, 1 \u2013 3 mg \n\nper day is an estimated median daily intake of Br for food and water (Acu-cell Nutrition, 2010b). \n\nBromine data on seafood are sparse, however according to some authors the average Br \n\nconcentration in fish is about 2 mg/kg, while in molluscs and crustaceans can reach much \n\nhigher values (Varo, 1992; Barrento et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n3.2.2.2 Rubidium (Rb) \n\nRubidium, a rarely studied alkali metal, may be an essential ultra trace element for humans \n\nand other organisms (Campbell et al., 2005). However, the circumstantial evidence supporting \n\nRb essentiality is still limited. Rubidium deficiency in goats reportedly results in depressed food \n\nintake, growth, and life expectancy and increased spontaneous absorption (Anke &amp; Angelow, \n\n1995) These finding with goats are complemented by earlier reports that Rb can possibly acts \n\nas a nutritional substitute for K in some functions, especially in lower forms of life (Nielsen, \n\n2000). Since this element is relatively non toxic and is not associated with any chronic disease, \n\nit has not received any media attention or supplement industry. The typical daily dietary intake \n\nof Rb of 1 to 5 mg probably ca be considered safe and, if essential, adequate (Nielsen, 2000). \n\nVery little information exists in regard on the concentrations and distribution of Rb in \n\nfreshwater and marine food webs (Campbell et al., 2005). A study performed by Carvalho et al. \n\n(2005) reported values around 2 mg/kg (dry weight) in some fish species and octopus eaten in \n\nPortugal.  \n\n \n\n3.2.2.3 Strontium (Sr)  \n\nThere is some difficulty regarding the classification of this metal relatively to its essentiality. \n\nThe human body absorbs Sr as if it is Ca and due to the chemical similarity, the stable forms of \n\nSr might not pose a significant health threat. In fact, the levels found naturally may actually be \n\nbeneficial. There is a long history of medical research regarding strontium's benefits, beginning \n\nin the 1950s (Wikipedia, 2010a). Studies indicate a lack of undesirable side-effects, and for that \n\nthe evidence that Sr is essential to human health is complex. Nevertheless, recent studies show \n\nthat adequate doses of specific essential nutrients, including Sr, prevent and fight against \n\nosteoporosis. This mineral is clinically effective in preventing fractures and bone loss and \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n21 \n\nincreases bone mineral density. Medical literature suggests that a judicious use of low doses of \n\nSr (for example some compounds of Sr, as strontium ranelate, gluconate, carbonate, lactate \n\nand chlorate) can be an effective and safe way to assist patients in restoring and maintaining \n\nbone health (Meunier et al., 2004; Genuis &amp; Schwalfenberg, 2007).\n \nIt also seems to have an \n\neffective role in dental caries being strontium chloride used as part of some toothpastes \n\nformulation (Acu-cell Nutrition, 2010c). There is no DRI established for Sr, nevertheless, 1 \u2013 5 \n\nmg per day is an estimated median daily intake of Sr for food and water (Acu-cell Nutrition, \n\n2010c). \n\nStudies on contents of Sr in seafood are scarce. Generally, fish present lower amounts of Sr \n\n(1-5 mg/kg) than molluscs and crustaceans (Segar et al., 1971; Teeny et al., 1984; Vlieg et al., \n\n1991; Garg &amp; Ramakrishna, 2006) being the highest values found in crustaceans (Barrento et \n\nal., 2008). \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Toxic elements \n\nDespite of the indisputable nutritional value of seafood, these products can accumulate in \n\ntheir edible part some pollutants. Among these pollutants it can be detached the dioxins, \n\npolychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs) and toxic elements like Hg, Cd, Pb and arsenic \n\n(As) (Fremy &amp; Bordet, 2002). The danger of their presence in the marine environment implies \n\nnot only the toxicity of proper environment but also a considerable level of these pollutants in \n\nthe trophic chain, which may constitute a risk for the human health (Burger &amp; Gochfeld, 2005). \n\nThe presence and concentration of toxic elements in the aquatic environment, including biota, \n\nspecifically in seafood which are used for human diet is based both on natural and \n\nanthropogenic sources (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2002). Natural levels of these elements are due to \n\nmarine volcanism, geological anomalies and geothermal events while anthropogenic are  \n\nprincipally related with intensive metallurgy. Fish and other seafood have always contained \n\ncertain amounts of toxic elements as a consequence of habitat. In open seas, unaffected by \n\npollution, seafood mostly carries just the natural burden of toxic elements content. In polluted \n\nareas, in waters which have no sufficient exchange with the world oceans, in estuaries, in rivers \n\nand especially in places which are close to sites of industrial activities, the concentrations of \n\ntoxic elements exceed the natural load (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2002). The main reasons of the toxicity \n\nof elements derive from the fact that many of these can replace metals in active sites of \n\nenzymes, bind to other radicals of enzymes and other biological molecules, replacing certain \n\ngroups in biological molecules, complexing or forming precipitates with enzyme metals or other \n\ngroups involved in metabolism, catalyzing the breakdown of essential metabolites, combined \n\nwith membranes, altering their permeability, and replace elements with electrochemical \n\nfunctions (Fra\u00fasto da Silva, 1985; Goyer, 1997). Mercury, Cd, Pb and As are cumulative toxic \n\nthat can be assimilated, stored and concentrated by living organisms through the food chain, \n\ncausing sometimes serious physiological effects. The animals are usually more sensitive to \n\ncontamination by toxic metals than plants, and humans are considered the most sensitive and \n\nthe most important target species. Since 2001, there are legal limits for Cd, Pb and Hg, \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n22 \n\nproposed by EU, for fish muscle in general, for some particular fishes, for crustaceans and for \n\nmolluscs (EU, 2006, 2008). Moreover, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee for Food \n\nAdditives (JECFA) has recommended the provisional tolerable weekly intakes (PTWI) (WHO, \n\n1999; 2003a). Table 3.6 summarizes these values for As, Cd, Pb and Hg and some usually \n\ncontents in seafood. \n\n \n\nTable 3.6 - Legal limits (LL), ranged values (RV) and PTWI for As, Cd, Pb and Hg in seafood. \n\nAs Cd Hg Pb  \n\nSeafood LLa RVb LL RVc LL RVc LL RVc \n\nFish in general - 0.05 - 450 0.05 &lt;0.01 - 0.05 0.50 &lt;0.05 - 0.50 0.30 &lt;0.1 - 0.2 \n\nParticular Fishd - - 0.10/0.30  &lt;0.01 - 0.12 1.0 &lt;0.05 - 2.4 - &lt;0.1 - 0.2 \n\nCrustaceans \n\n(excluding brown \n\nmeat) \n\n- &lt;0.1 - 270 0.50 &lt;0.01 - 1.1 0.50 &lt;0.05 0.50 &lt;0.1 - 0.1 \n\nCephalopods \n\n(without viscera) \n\n- 4.0 - 50 1.0 0.01 - 3.8 0.50 &lt;0.05 - 0.17 1.0 &lt;0.1 - 0.2 \n\nBivalves molluscs - 0.13 - 240 1.0 0.03 - 1.4 0.50 &lt;0.05 - 0.05 1.5 &lt;0.1 - 0.4 \n\nPTWI (\u00b5g/kg bw) 50 7e 5 25 \na \n- Legal limits proposed by EU (2006, 2008) (mg/kg); \n\nb\n - Values in mg/kg, dw in Neff (2004); \n\nc \n- Values in mg/kg, ww, in \n\nAfonso et al.

The toxicity of As \n\ndepends on its oxidation state and molecular form. For example As (III) is more toxic than As \n\n(V), while arsenobetaine and arsenocholine, arseno-organic compounds, are relatively non-toxic \n\n(Storeli &amp; Marcotrigiano, 2000; ATSDR, 2007a). The high intakes of inorganic As, mainly due to \n\nchronic exposure to elevated levels in drinking water are associated with several toxic effects \n\nincluding increased risk of numerous types of cancer (IOM, 2001; Belitz et al., 2004; ATSDR, \n\n2007a). Studies performed in chickens, rats and goats were done to test As essentiality (Belitz \n\net al., 2004). Its deficiency in goats appears to cause growth alterations, reproduction problems, \n\nmilk production and sudden dead (McDonald et al., 2002). Its metabolic role is not yet \n\nunderstood. It appears to be involved in the metabolism of methionine. Choline can be replaced \n\nby arsenocholine in some of its functions (Belitz et al., 2004). The general population may be \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n23 \n\nexposed to As in air, drinking water, and food, but human intake of As occurs mainly via food  \n\nchain, and it is loosely related to the consumption of seafood (Figure 3.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Schematic representation of the cycle of arsenic in the environment. (Picture source \n\nsite: GDR, 2009). \n\n \n\nMarine organisms are known to accumulate total As in the range of 1 \u2013 100 mg/kg from their \n\nenvironment and food sources. The majority of As is present as organoarsenic species, \n\nmetabolised from inorganic As present in seawater or accumulated from food sources such as \n\nalgae or other fish. Providentially, arsenobetaine is the major component (typically more than 90 \n\n% present As) in a variety of seafood products and it is considered as a non-toxic compound \n\n(Ackley, et al., 1999; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2000; Cava-Montesinos et al., 2005). In EU no legal limits for \n\nthe As levels in seafood have been established so far. Nevertheless, the Food and Drug \n\nAdministration (FDA) suggests a limit of 76 mg/kg for crustaceans (FDA, 1993c) and the World \n\nHealth Organization (WHO) recommends a tolerable daily intake of 0.05 mg As/kg body weight \n\nfrom food (WHO, 1983). \n\n \n\n3.2.3.2 Cadmium (Cd) \n\nCadmium is an industrial and environmental pollutant that affects adversely a number of \n\norgans in humans. It is also a natural element in the earth\u00b4s crust. It is usually found as a \n\nmineral combined with other elements such as oxygen (cadmium oxide), chlorine (cadmium \n\nchloride), or sulphur (cadmium sulphate, cadmium sulphide) (ATSDR, 2008). Anthropogenic \n\nsources of Cd include mining operations, metallurgical industries, the corrosion of galvanized \n\nzinc, industrial production of batteries and the application of fertilizer and sewage sludge to farm \n\nland (Fra\u00fasto da Silva, 1985; Goyer &amp; Clarkson, 2001; Castro-Gonz\u00e1lez &amp; M\u00e9ndez-Armenta, \n\n2008; ATSDR, 2008). In foods of animal origin, and as happens in humans, Cd is found mainly \n\nin internal organs like the liver and kidney (Goyer &amp; Clarkson, 2001; ATSDR, 2008; Castro-\n\nNatural Sources Anthropogenic Sources \n\nvolcanism \n\nforest fires\n\ngeochemical \nbackground \n\nwell \n\nImmobilized forms \n\nGroundwater \n\nMicroorganisms \n\nMicroorganisms \n\nIndustries \n\nagriculture \n\nNatural Sources Anthropogenic Sources \n\nvolcanism \n\nforest fires\n\ngeochemical \nbackground \n\nwell \n\nImmobilized forms \n\nGroundwater \n\nMicroorganisms \n\nMicroorganisms \n\nIndustries \n\nagriculture \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n24 \n\nGonz\u00e1lez &amp; M\u00e9ndez-Armenta, 2008). This metal interacts with the metabolism of four essential \n\nelements: Zn, Fe, Ca and Cu (Goyer, 1997; Peraza et al., 1998). Another important nutritional \n\naspect of Cd is its interaction with the sulphydryl -rich protein, metallothioneins (MT).  \n\nTable 3.7 summarizes the major Cd interactions with some elements. \n\n \n\nTable 3.7 - Major Cd interactions with micronutrients (Adapted from Peraza et al., 1998). \n\nMetal nutrient Interaction and mechanism Effects of nutrient on metal \ntoxicity \n\nCd - Zn Competes for GI* absorption; Cd \ninterferes with Zn metabolism \n\nReverses Cd toxicity (i.e. decreases \n\ngrowth, increase lesions and \n\ntesticular necrosis) \n\nCd - Fe Decreases Fe absorption and \nmetabolism (Cd possibly binds with \n\nferritin and transferrin) \n\nSupplementation corrects anaemia: \n\nincreases hematocrit and increases \n\nhaemoglobin levels \n\nCd - Ca \n \n\nDecreases intestinal Ca transport; \n\nincreases Cd deposits in bone tissue \n\nin a Ca deficient state \n\nSufficiency protects against bone \n\ndeformities, osteomalacia, and \n\nosteoporosis (Itai-Itai disease) \n\nCd - Cu Interferes with Cu metabolism, \npossibly by decreasing Cu \n\nabsorption \n\nCorrects Cd-induced decreased \n\nplasma ceruloplasmin \n\nconcentrations \n\nCd - Se Selenium shifts Cd binding to higher \nmolecular weight proteins \n\nMT can bind with essential nutrients \n\n*GI - Gastrointestinal. \n\nCadmium-zinc interactions There are many similarities between Cd and Zn. Both metals \n\nare members of the group IIB in periodic table and both have a similar tendency to form \n\ntetrahedral complexes and therefore it seems that the two metals have similar interactions with \n\nthe human body (Peraza et al., 1998; Brz\u00f3ska &amp; Moniuszko-Jakoniuk, 2001). Cadmium has an \n\ninhibitory effect on the activity of Zn-containing enzymes such as carboxypeptidase and ?-\n\nmannosidase. Zinc is also replaced by Cd in MT. Some of the symptoms of chronic Cd toxicity \n\nare similar to those of Zn deficiency. In both cases, growth failure, parakeratotic lesions and \n\nimpaired glucose tolerance occurs. \n\nCadmium-iron interactions The development of anaemia is one of the symptoms associated \n\nwith Cd intoxication. This is a result of the inhibitory effect of Cd on Fe metabolism and \n\nabsorption. Cadmium decreases hematocrit and haemoglobin levels in exposed workers. \n\nFerritin or transferrin could be involved in the Cd-Fe interaction observed during Cd intoxication \n\n(Peraza et al., 1998). \n\nCadmium-calcium interactions Cadmium toxicity affects Ca metabolism, and individuals \n\nwith severe Cd nephropathy may have renal calculi and excess excretion of Ca, probably \n\nrelated to increases urinary loss. Associated skeletal changes are probably related to Ca loss \n\nand include bone pain, osteomalacia, and/or osteoporosis. Bone changes are part of Itai-Itai \n\ndisease, a syndrome recognizes in postmenopausal multiparous women living in the Funchu \n\narea of Japan prior to and during World War II. The syndrome consists of severe bone \n\ndeformities and chronic renal disease (Peraza et al., 1998; Goyer &amp; Clarkson, 2001). \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n25 \n\nCadmium-copper interactions The most obvious disturbance in Cu metabolism caused by \n\nCd is the reduced plasma ceruloplasmin concentrations. Ceruloplasmin is the protein \n\nresponsible for transporting Cu throughout the circulatory system. Another explanation for the \n\nCd-Cu interaction is that the two metals compete for binding sites on MT. Copper displaces Cd \n\nfrom MT because of its higher affinity for the protein (Peraza et al., 1998). \n\nCadmium-metallothionein interactions The accumulation of Cd in the kidneys to some \n\nextent without apparent toxic effect is possible because of the formation of Cd-thionein or \n\nmetallothionein, a metal-protein complex with a low molecular weight. Metallothionein is \n\nprimarily a tissue protein and is ubiquitous in most organs, but it exists in the highest \n\nconcentration in the liver, particularly following recent exposure to Cd, and in the kidneys, where \n\nit accumulates with age in proportion to Cd concentration. Cadmium bound to metallothionein \n\nwithin tissues is fortuitous result of the chemical similarity between Cd and the essential trace \n\nmetals (Peraza et al., 1998; Goyer &amp; Clarkson, 2001). \n\nCadmium-selenium interactions Nutritional studies have shown that Se offers some \n\nprotection against acute Cd-induced toxicity. The protective role of Se probably come into play \n\nby the shifting of Cd binding from MT to higher molecular-weight proteins. This allows MT to be \n\nunencumbered and therefore able to bind essential nutrients such as Zn and Cu (Peraza et al., \n\n1998). \n\nHypertension, neurological disorders and carcinogenicity Some epidemiologic studies \n\nsuggest that Cd is an etiologic agent for essential hypertension, others suggested a relationship \n\nbetween abnormal behaviour and/or decreased intelligence in children and adults exposed to \n\nCd and still other studies have shown a relationship between occupational (respiratory) \n\nexposure to Cd and lung cancer and possibly prostate cancer (Goyer &amp; Clarkson, 2001; Castro-\n\nGonz\u00e1lez &amp; M\u00e9ndez-Armenta, 2008). \n\nCadmium pathway to humans occurs mainly through two sources. One source is through \n\ninhalation of Cd particles during industrial or everyday activities, among which the inhaled Cd\n2+\n\n \n\nfrom cigarette should be considered as highly hazardous because Cd is easily absorbed by the \n\nlungs (Goyer, 1997; Castro-Gonz\u00e1lez &amp; M\u00e9ndez-Armenta, 2008). Another is the oral route \n\nthrough water and food contaminated with Cd, particularly leafy vegetables, grains, cereals, \n\nfruits, organ meat, and seafood. \n\nCadmium content in fish muscle is generally low, ranging between 0.01 to 0.1 mg / kg wet \n\nweight (Francesconi, 2007), however it may be deposited in greater quantities in fish organs like \n\nkidneys and liver. These organs can be deeply contaminated and should preferably not be \n\nconsumed (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2002). However, the situation with marine invertebrates like \n\nmolluscs and crustaceans is different. Molluscs, especially cephalopods, are active Cd \n\naccumulators (Bustamante et al., 1998). Cephalopods, like octopus, squid or cuttlefish can store \n\nlarge amounts of Cd in their intestines while their mantle and tentacle contain less amount \n\n(Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2002). If the elimination of all intestines is not done from cephalopods \n\nimmediately after catch, Cd can migrate from the intestines into the muscle tissue. Probably, the \n\nCd level in these muscle tissues will surpass the legal limits. Some bivalve molluscs can also \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n26 \n\nhave high contents of Cd and the levels must be regularly monitored. The higher Cd content in \n\nmolluscs is the justification for higher legal limits of Cd for this group of seafood.  \n\n \n\n3.2.3.3 Mercury (Hg) \n\nMercury is one of the most important pollutants both because of its effect on marine \n\norganisms and because it is potentially hazardous to humans (Storelli et al., 2003). This \n\nelement may occur naturally in the environment (mineral, deposits, volcanoes, forest fires, \n\noceanic emission, and crust degassing) or be released  by human activities such as agriculture \n\nindustry (fungicides, seed preservatives), mining, mineral processing and combustion of fossil \n\nfuels, by pharmaceuticals, as pulp and paper preservatives, catalysts in organic syntheses, in \n\nthermometers and batteries, in amalgams and in chlorine and caustic soda production (Renzoni \n\net al., 1998; Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2002). The toxicology and the environmental behaviour of Hg are \n\ncomplex, since its toxicity, mobility, and bioaccumulation depend on its chemical form (Storelli et \n\nal., 2003), elemental or metallic, inorganic or organic. Figure 3.3 shows the main aspects of the \n\nbiogeochemical cycle of Hg. Mercury in the atmosphere can be transported over great \n\ndistances, so even areas without natural or anthropogenic sources of Hg, the contamination \n\nmay be present, and thus it is a global pollution problem. In the atmosphere, almost all Hg is in \n\nelemental form (Hg\n0\n). By reaction with ozone and OH radicals, the Hg\n\n0\n is oxidized to Hg\n\n2+\n, being \n\nless volatile, it condenses and is deposited. In aquatic ecosystems, the Hg\n2+\n\n can be reduced to \n\nHg\n0\n, returning to the atmosphere, or biotransformed into organic forms. Biotransformation is the \n\nmethylation of Hg\n2+\n\n by sulphate-reducing bacteria, which live in conditions of anoxia, usually in \n\nthe sediment or the water column (EPA, 2001).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Conceptual biogeochemical mercury cycle. (Picture source site: Annenberg Learner, 2010) \n\n \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n27 \n\nThe organic compound that is formed is usually the monometylmercury (CH3Hg\n+ \n\n- MeHg) \n\nwhich, besides being the most toxic form, is quite stable and it is absorbed easily during \n\ndigestion and accumulates in aquatic organisms. It also enters fish bodies directly through their \n\nskin and gills. Beyond MeHg methylation of Hg (II), it can also be produced dimethylmercury \n\n(CH3)2Hg) that is quite volatile, and does not accumulate in aquatic organisms (Augelli et al., \n\n2007). \n\nElemental Hg is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but is almost completely \n\nabsorbed through respiratory tract, rapidly crossing the blood-brain barrier and causing \n\nneurotoxity. Its vapour accounts for most occupational mercury exposures. At the cellular level \n\nthe dissolved vapour is oxidized to Hg\n2+\n\n, which causes nephrotoxiity (Peraza et al., 1998; Goyer \n\n&amp; Clarkson, 2001, Hajeb et al., 2009). Inorganic Hg is hydrophilic and thus is the most \n\nnephrotoxic form, affecting mainly the straight segment of the proximal tubule. The mechanism \n\nof toxicity of inorganic Hg is by impairing mitochondrial function. Mercury possibly promotes \n\nmitochondrial membrane leakage and increases mitochondrial oxygen consumption with \n\nsubsequent increased production of hydrogen peroxide (Peraza et al., 1998). The mercuric ion \n\nalso has a high activity for ligands containing sulfhydryl groups, strongly inhibiting the activity of \n\nenzymes that contain those groups (Hajeb et al., 2009). The mercuric chloride is the inorganic \n\nsalt whose toxicity is well known. Its oral ingestion causes severe abdominal pain, bloody \n\ndiarrhea and suppression of urine. Ulceration, haemorrhage and necrosis gastrointestinal tract \n\nis accompanied by a circulatory collapse (Goyer &amp; Clarkson, 2001). \n\nThe MeHg organometallic species is a lipophilic compound easily absorbed. It crosses the \n\nblood brain barrier and placenta and reacts with their target organs, the tissues of the brain, \n\nbeing a neurotoxic agent that affects the development of the nervous system, resulting in \n\npsychological disturbance, impaired hearing, loss of sight, ataxia, loss of motor control and \n\ngeneral debilitation (Storeli et al., 2005). It also causes blockage of binding sites of enzymes, \n\ninterferes in protein synthesis, hampers thymidine incorporation into DNA (Ur\u00eda &amp; Sanz-Medel, \n\n1998). The MeHg suffers biotransformation to compounds of Hg (II) in tissues, by breaking the \n\ncarbon-mercury (Goyer &amp; Clarkson, 2001). Various studies suggest that disruption of the \n\nmolecule MeHg causes the formation of free radicals, which affect the lipid membranes of \n\nneurons, leading to their damage. This situation should not be strange that the toxic effects of \n\nMeHg might be reduced by antioxidants such as selenium (Lall, 1995; Sivaperumal et al., \n\n2007). The MeHg also has a high affinity for sulphydryl groups and, therefore, the complexes \n\nwith SH groups, in which the amino acid cysteine is particularly rich, serve ligand and provide \n\ntransport of Hg in blood and central nervous system (Carvalho et al., 2005; Hajeb et al., 2009). \n\nOne of the most notable cases of MeHg poisoning occurred in Minamata Bay (Japan) between \n\n1932 and 1968, after discharges by an industrial unit in the bay, causing a high number of \n\nvictims, and for that reason known as Minamata disease. Also in Iraq, between 1971 and 1972, \n\none of the most serious cases was due to the consumption of bread made with seeds that had \n\nbeen treated with MeHg to prevent fungal growth. The peasants to get rid of contaminated \n\nseed, threw them in rivers and lakes, contaminating the water and aquatic organisms. This \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n28 \n\nresulted in the deaths of more than five thousand people and another 100 000 were disabled \n\n(Virtanen et al., 2007; Afonso et al., 2007).  \n\nSeveral nutrients have been found to affect the toxicity of Hg. Of these, Se has been the most \n\nwidely studied. In general, Se has a protective effect, delaying the onset of mercury toxicity or \n\nreduces the severity of the effects of both inorganic forms of Hg and MeHg (Goyer, 1997). \n\nSelenium protection against inorganic Hg may involve a variety of mechanisms such as the \n\ndirect stoichiometric complexing of Hg to reduce its availability. The reduction of Hg availability \n\nhas not been proven because Hg levels are not decreased by Se. It may possible that Se \n\ninterferes with the metabolism of inorganic Hg by reacting with the mercuric ion to form a \n\ncompound that is less toxic than the mercuric ion. Selenium influences the oxidation rate of Hg\n0\n \n\nto mercuric ions that seems to be species dependent. The protection of Se against MeHg is not \n\nclear. Methylmercury is degraded to mercuric ion. The rate of this process is also species \n\ndependent. Selenium may protect against MeHg as described for inorganic Hg (Peraza et al., \n\n1998). There may also be another protective mechanism involving Se. When MeHg is degraded \n\nto inorganic Hg, the methyl moiety can also be further degraded by homolyis to methyl free \n\nradicals. These molecules may initiate a chain reaction peroxidation of various lipid \n\nconstituents. Selenium-dependent GSH protects the cells by catalyzing the reduction of \n\nhydrogen peroxide and other organic hydroperoxides to products of greater stability (Peraza et \n\nal., 1998). Another nutrient that protect against MeHg toxicity is vitamin E. The mechanism of \n\naction of vitamin E is that of a scavenger of radicals that otherwise initiate MeHg breakdown. \n\nVitamin E also can react with methyl radicals that might be formed in the breakdown. \n\nNevertheless, the most effective action of vitamin E may be related to its location in the cell \n\nmembranes and to its ability to stabilize membranes by interacting with unsaturated fatty acid \n\nchains (Peraza et al., 1998). \n\nMethylmercury bioaccumulates in the aquatic food chain and is found in all species of fish and \n\nfish-eating animals. In humans, the major exposure to MeHg also occurs via food, with the \n\nmajor sources being fish and fish products. Almost 100 % of the Hg present in fish is MeHg. \n\nThe highest concentrations are found in large and old predatory fish, such as sharks, swordfish, \n\ntuna and pike (Virtanen et al., 2007). The occurrence of Hg in seafood is a common subject for \n\nhuman health risk evaluation and is of particular concern to the food agencies. The combination \n\nof the metal concentrations obtained in the seafood products analyzed and the consumption \n\ninformation permits to estimate the dietary intake. To evaluate the health risk of this estimated \n\ndietary exposure it have to be compared with the PTWI that are recommended by JECFA: 5 \u00b5g \n\nHg/kg body weight (WHO, 1999), no more than 1.6 \u00b5g MeHg/kg body weight (WHO, 2003a). In \n\norder to support in the accuracy of such recommendations, total Hg of marketed seafood is \n\nregulated. Maximum allowable levels differ between countries. Actually, EU established a level \n\nof 0.50 mg/kg wet weight for the majority of fishes and 1.0 mg/kg wet weight for those species \n\nthat are recognized as naturally accumulating elevated levels of Hg (large, long-lived, \n\ncarnivorous fishes) (EU, 2006, 2008).  \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n29 \n\nWith all this information is therefore important, the assessment of Hg levels in fishery products \n\nnot only as a factor of toxicologically, but also for the assessment of potential impacts on public \n\nhealth (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n3.2.3.4 Lead (Pb) \n\nLead is a naturally-occurring bluish-gray metal that is rarely found in its elemental form, but \n\noccurs in the Earth\u00b4s crust primarily as the mineral galena (PbS), and to a lesser extent as \n\nanglesite (PbSO4) and cerussite (PbCO3). This metal is not a particularly abundant element, but \n\nits ore deposits are readily accessible and widely distributed throughout the world. Its \n\nproperties, such as corrosion resistance, density, and low melting point, make it a familiar metal \n\nin pipes, solder, weights, and storage batteries (ATSDR, 2007b). The principal routes of \n\nexposure for general population is food and environmental sources. These sources include Pb \n\nbased indoor paint in old dwellings, in dust, in contaminated drinking water, in air from \n\ncombustion of Pb-containing industrial emissions, hand-to-mouth activities of young children \n\nliving in polluted areas, Pb-glazed pottery, and, less commonly, Pb dust brought home by \n\nindustrial workers on their shoes and clothes (Goyer &amp; Clarkson, 2001). Because of health \n\nconcerns, Pb from paints and ceramic products, caulking, and pipe solder has been \n\ndramatically reduced in recent years. The use of Pb as an additive to gasoline was also banned \n\nin most countries of the world (Goyer, 1997; ATSDR, 2007b). Actually, 95-98 % of all Pb \n\npresent in the environment can be traced back to anthropogenic activities (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, \n\n2002). Lead toxicity affects several organs systems, including the nervous, haematopoietic, \n\nrenal, endocrine, and skeletal, depending on the age of the subject and the size of the dose, but \n\nthe effect of major concern is the impairment of cognitive and behavioural development in \n\ninfants and young children (Goyer, 1997; Castro-Gonz\u00e1lez &amp; M\u00e9ndez-Armenta, 2008). Lead \n\ncan bind covalently to organic ligand such as alkyl groups forming stable organometallic \n\ncompounds as tetraethyl Pb (used as a gasoline additive). These forms can easily cross the cell \n\nmembrane by diffusion, accumulating particularly in tissues rich in lipid structures. In humans, \n\norganic forms cross the blood brain barrier and affect the central nervous system (Goyer &amp; \n\nClarkson, 2001).The symptoms of Pb poisining are headache, irritability, abdominal pain and \n\nvarious symptoms related to the nervous system (J\u00e4rup, 2003). Chronic Pb toxicity in humans \n\noften develop dullness, irritability, poor attention span, epigastria, constipation, vomiting, \n\nconvulsions, coma and death. Children may be affected by encephalopathy with lethargy, \n\nmental dullness, vomiting, irritability, and anorexia; in severe cases, the prolonged exposition of \n\nPb can decrease the cognitive function and increase behaviour disorders, specially aggression, \n\npsychosis, confusion and mental deficit (J\u00e4rup, 2003; ATSDR, 2007b). Blood Pb level indicates \n\na recent exposure, whereas bone Pb level, which forms 90-95 % of Pb burden in adults and 80-\n\n95 % of total Pb in children indicates a chronic exposure (Kakkar &amp; Jaffery, 2005).  \n\nNutritional deficiencies of essential elements can increase the hazard from Pb exposure by \n\nenhancing absorption and toxicity of dietary Pb. The essential elements with the most market \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n30 \n\ninfluence on Pb levels and toxic effects are Ca, Fe and Zn. Table 3.8 summarizes the major Pb \n\ninteractions with some elements. \n\n \n\nTable 3.8 - Major Pb interactions with micronutrients (Adapted from Peraza et al., 1998). \n\nMetal nutrient Interaction and mechanism Effects of nutrient on metal toxicity \n\nPb - Ca Competes for binding sites on \n\nintestinal mucosal proteins \n\nSufficiency decreases GI* absorption \n\nof Pb and decreases concentration of \n\nPb in critical organs \n\nPb - Fe Competes for Fe transport \n\nsystems (i.e. ferritin) of the \n\nintestine \n\nSupplementation may decrease Pb \n\nabsorption and toxicity (i.e. \n\nhaematopoiesis depression) \n\nPb - Zn Competes for GI uptake Supplementation decreases Pb GI \n\nabsorption, decreases Pb tissue \n\naccumulation, and thus decreases Pb \n\ntoxicity (i.e. inhibitory effects on ?-\n\nALAD**) \n\n*GI - Gastrointestinal; **?-ALAD - ?-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. \n\n \n\nLead-calcium interactions There are several suggestions in the lead toxicity literature that \n\nthe two metals are metabolically related (Goyer, 1997). These interactions occur at the cellular \n\nand molecular levels and are a result of the ability of Pb to mimic or  displace Ca during specific \n\nphysiologic processes. For example, Pb can block Ca efflux from cells by substituting for Ca in \n\nCa\n2+\n\n/Na\n+\n adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pumps. Although it is not possible to mimic the animal \n\nstudies in people, balance studies conducted by several authors (Goyer, 1997) shows an \n\ninverse relationship between dietary Ca and Pb absorption and retention. However, there is little \n\ninformation regarding the effect of excess Ca, on Pb absorption. \n\nLead-iron interactions Iron deficiency also enhances Pb absorption and promotes Pb \n\ntoxicity. This is more evident in pregnant women and young children that are more susceptible \n\nto dietary Pb (Peraza et al., 1998). Lead inhibits two major enzymes of the heme biosynthetic \n\npathway: ?-ALAD and ferrochelatase. Lead also interferes with mitochondrial energy \n\nmetabolism, which is necessary to reduce ferric ion to ferrous ion before insertion of Fe into the \n\nporphyrin ring. When Fe deficiency is present ferrochelatase is more sensitive to these effects \n\nof Pb and results in depression of haematopoiesis. Therefore, iron supplementation may \n\nprevent this toxic effect of Pb on haematopoiesis (Peraza et al., 1998, Goyer &amp; Clarkson, 2001). \n\nLead-zinc interactions These interactions are not so well defined as those between Pb and \n\nCa or Pb and Fe. Their is a close inverse relationship between blood Pb and activity of Zn-\n\ncontaining heme enzymes, particularly ?-ALAD, which suggests that Pb replaces Zn in these \n\nenzymes (Goyer, 1997). \n\nThe Pb content in fish muscle from fish that is caught in the open sea is very low, amounting \n\nto 2 \u2013 10 \u00b5g/kg. The uptake of Pb through the food chain is of little importance since the \n\nconcentration of Pb in fish does not increase with trophic level and age but rises with increasing \n\nconcentration in water (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2002). Elevated Pb content in muscle tissue is reported \n\nonly from areas with intensive industrial and agriculture activities and input of untreated \n\n\n\nBackground \n\n \n\n31 \n\nmunicipal and industrial waste waters (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2002). In invertebrates as molluscs and \n\ncrustaceans, Pb levels can be higher than in fish and can reach values of approximately 1 \n\nmg/kg. This is caused by an active accumulation of Pb in the digestive tract, hepatopancreas, of \n\nboth molluscs and crustaceans. Like for Cd, the digestive tract of these kind of seafood has to \n\nbe removed prior to consumption, preferably immediately after catch, to prevent a migration of \n\nPb from intestine into muscle tissue. \n\n \n\n3.3 Risk assessment of seafood consumption \n\nThe use of risk assessment is achieving progressive importance and recognition as a \n\nscientifically based approach to food safety and quality standards. According to Wal &amp; Pascal \n\n(2000), the term \"risk\" can be defined as the probability of an adverse effect on a given \n\norganism, population or environment, as a result of exposure to a hazard. On the other hand, \n\nbenefit is something that promotes or enhances well-being in the live organisms. To perform a \n\nrisk assessment of a population that is exposed to certain food contaminants is necessary to \n\nunderstand and characterize this hazard, i.e., to determine their toxicological properties and \n\nestablish the relationship between dose and adverse effects manifested (Nasreddine &amp; Parent- \n\nMassin, 2002). The process of risk assessment can be divided into four stages: 1 - hazard \n\nidentification, 2 - hazard characterization, 3 - exposure assessment, and 4 - risk \n\ncharacterization. The latter contains all the information obtained in the first three steps, \n\nperforming qualitative and quantitative toxicological properties of an agent and its harmful \n\neffects on individuals exposed (Kroes et al., 2002).  \n\nToday is generally accepted that seafood is important in a healthy and balanced human diet \n\n(WHO, 2003b) principally by the positive effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. \n\nHowever, seafood products are also a source of persistent chemical contaminants that \n\naccumulate in the marine food chain. Therefore, an increase in fish consumption to achieve an \n\nadequate intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may also increase the intake of these \n\ncontaminants. Because of this phenomenon, a quantitative assessment of the intake of \n\nnutrients and contaminants via seafood consumption - and to ensuing health risk - have to be \n\ncarried out in order to have more detailed information about the contribution of the various \n\nspecies to nutrient/contaminant intake (Sioen et al., 2007). Actually, these nutritional-\n\ntoxicological conflict related to seafood consumption has already been discussed at the \n\nCommission of the Codex on Contaminants in Food (Commission of the Codex Alimentarius) \n\nand a FAO/WHO expert consultation on the risks and benefits of seafood consumption was \n\nschedule in 2010, showing the pertinence of this subject (Sioen et al., 2009). On the paper VI it \n\nis presented a mathematical-statistical framework for quantifying the probabilities of risk \n\nassociated with seafood consumption. In addition, the estimation of the intake of MeHg is done \n\nthrough the cephalopod species as well as through their consumption in Portugal, and thus, the \n\nestimation of the portion of a given population at risk (probability of exceeding MeHg PTWI) is \n\nalso performed. \n\n\n\nDesign of the Study \n\n \n\n32 \n\n4 DESIGN OF THE STUDY \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThree of the studies included in this work were designed to characterize some seafood, not so \n\nwell studied in Portugal, in what concerns proximate and elemental composition as well as to \n\nprovide knowledge of their contribution to dietary reference intake (DRI) or tolerable upper \n\nintake level (UL) (I-III). \n\n \n\nElements, as Cd, Pb and Hg, considered non essential and harmful to humans were also \n\nquantified in the same seafood species and some deep water fish species (I-III, V). The relation \n\nof Se/Hg and correlations between elements and biological parameters were also studied (I-II, \n\nIV-V). The risk assessment, in terms of MeHg, in the cephalopods consumed in Portugal, was \n\nalso analysed (VI). \n\n \n\nIn addition, three other papers deal with the As contents in some seafood consumed in Portugal \n\n(VII), toxic elements in bivalve molluscs (VIII) and the influence of canning in the concentration \n\nof toxic elements (IX). \n\n \n\n(I, VII) \n\n(II, VII) \n\n(IX) \n\n(IV, V, VII)\n\n(III, VII) \n\n(I, VII) \n\n(II, VII) \n\n(IX) \n\n(IV, V, VII)\n\n \n\n(III, VII) \n\n(I, VII) \n\n(II, VII) \n\n(IX) \n\n(IV, V, VII)\n\n(III, VII) \n\n \n\nMe-HgMe-HgMe-Hg\n\n(VI) \n\n(VIII)\n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n33 \n\n5 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n5.1 Biological material \n\nAll fishery products used in this study were purchased directly from outlets in the Lisbon area \n\nor in several commercial farms located in Portugal, obtained from cruise ships organized by the \n\nInstituto Nacional de Recursos Biol\u00f3gicos (INRB, IP / L-IPIMAR) under the project \"Programa \n\nNacional de Amostragem Biol\u00f3gica / Recolha de Dados\" (PNAB/EU Regulation) and collected \n\nat various production areas localised along the Portuguese coastal zone and estuaries, without \n\na periodicity established, between 2000 and 2007. \n\nAs sampling plays an important role in obtaining representative results, it was tried, whenever \n\npossible, to obey the Commission Directive 2001/22/EC of 8 March 2001 (EU, 2001) and more \n\nrecently the Commission Directive 2005/4/EC of 19 January 2005 amending Directive \n\n2001/22/EC (EU, 2005) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 333/2007 of 28 March 2007 (EU, \n\n2007), laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of \n\nthe levels of Pb, Cd, Hg and 3-MCPD in foodstuffs. \n\nStudied samples were several species of fish, including farmed ones, three cephalopods, \n\nseveral bivalve molluscs and one crustacean. Canned seafood was also studied. The common \n\nname, scientific name and the number of analysed samples are described in Table 5.1. The \n\nmorphology, habitat and fishing mode are described in detail in Annex A of this thesis (Data \n\ncollected from the databases, \"FishBase\", \"CephBase\" and also Sanchez (1992)). Seafood \n\nproducts studied were selected taking into account the higher consumption in our country and \n\nthe fact that some of these species have been little studied in Portugal. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 - List of studied species. \n\nSpecies Product Scientific name Samples \n(number) \n\nBivalves* 11 species - 554 \n\nCanned fish** 10 products - 1682 \n\n Cuttlefish Sepia officinalis 10 \n\nCephalopods Octopus Loligo vulgaris 10 \n\n Squid Octopus vulgaris 10 \n\nCrustacean Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus 10 \n\nDeep-water fish Blackbelly rosefish Helicolenus dactylopterus \ndactylopterus \n\n50 \n\n Black scabbardfish Aphanopus carbo 410 \n\n Gilthead seabream Sparus aurata 10 \n\nFarmed fish European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax 10 \n\n Trout Oncorrinchus mykiss 10 \n\n Turbot Psetta maxima 7 \n\n* See paper VIII; ** See paper IX. \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n34 \n\nAll fishery products were transported from the place of purchase to the laboratory refrigerated \n\nor already frozen. Upon arrival at the laboratory, all specimens were weighed and measured \n\naccording to its type and to the criteria described by Sanchez (1992). Within each species, it \n\nwas analyzed the edible part of several specimens, individually whenever possible. Once \n\nhomogenized, samples were placed in plastic bags, previously coded and frozen at -30 \u00b0 C until \n\nfurther analysis. Time is a factor that does not change the mineral composition, as they do not \n\nvolatilize at room temperature or to usual temperatures in frozen storage (Nunes, personal \n\npresentation). \n\nThe laboratory equipment used in the analysis was washed and/or decontaminated (HNO3 \n\n20%, v/v), taking into account the analysis to be undertaken and to avoid any contamination. \n\nThe mill granulator (Retsch GM 200) used in the homogenization of the samples had a layer of \n\ntitanium. \n\n \n\n5.2 Methodologies \n\nThe techniques used at Unit \"Valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos Produtos da Pesca e Aquicultura\" (U-VPPA) of \n\nINRB, I.P./L-IPIMAR, are validated in accordance with the Guide RELACRE 2000 (RELACRE, \n\n2000) and IPAC (Portuguese Institute for Accreditation) Guides including the Guidelines for \n\nAccreditation of Laboratories for Chemistry (2001, 2005). The chemical  laboratory of the Unit \n\nU-VPPA, which hosted the techniques used is accredited by IPAC (2010) for determining \n\nmoisture, mineral, fat, total Hg, Cd and Pb. The technique for determining the elements for \n\nEDFRX was validated by the laboratory of the Atomic Physics Centre (Experimental Atomic \n\nPhysics Section) of Science College of Lisbon University (FCUL). \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Proximate composition \n\nThe proximate composition - crude protein, fat, moisture and mineral contents - was \n\ndetermined according to AOAC (1998) methods. \n\n \n\n5.2.1.1 Water \n\nDispersion of the sample, drying at a temperature of 105 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C and cooling until constant \n\nweight. \n\nWeigh approximately 10 g of homogenized sample with the accuracy of \u00b1 0.001 g (balance \n\nMettler Toledo, AG 204) for a glass crystallizer previously weighed. Then dried at 105 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C \n\novernight (oven Memmert, ULE 500). Next day withdrew from the oven the crystallizer to a \n\ndesiccators and cool at least 30 minutes and weigh. Repeat this last operation until constant \n\nweight. \n\nThe water content of the product, expressed in grams per 100 g of the sample is given by: \n\n100100\n\n2\n\n13\n\u00d7?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n\nm\n\nmm\n \n\nwhere \n\nm1 - mass in grams, of the crystallizer; \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n35 \n\nm2 - mass in grams, of the test sample; \n\nm3 - mass in grams, of all of the crystallizer and the test sample, after drying. \n\n \n\nThe result is calculated based on the determination of at least two tests on the same sample. \n\n \n\n5.2.1.2 Crude protein \n\nSample digestion with sulphuric acid in the presence of a catalyst. Alkalinisation of the extract \n\nwith excess sodium hydroxide. Steam distillation to release ammonia and receipt in a boric acid \n\nsolution followed by titration with a hydrochloric acid solution. The total nitrogen content is \n\ncalculated based on the quantity of ammonia produced. The crude protein content is calculated \n\nby multiplying the result by a conventional conversion factor of 6.25. \n\nWeigh 0.5 to 1 g of homogenized sample with the accuracy of \u00b1 0.001 g (balance Mettler \n\nToledo, AG 204) to a filter paper for a Kjeldahl tube. Add a pellet catalyst (Kjeltab S/3,5) and 20 \n\nml of concentrated sulphuric acid (Merck, 95-97 %, m/m). Place in the apparatus of digestion \n\n(Tecator, Digestion System 20 - 1015 Digester) and digest about 1 hour (310 \u00b0 C for 10 minutes \n\nand subsequently at 450 \u00ba C for 50 minutes). Cool the tubes and proceeded to the distillation of \n\nammonia, according to the instructions of the distillation apparatus (Tecator, Kjeltec Auto - 1035 \n\nAnalyser). The sample extract is alkalinized with excess sodium hydroxide solution (Merck, 40 \n\n% m/v), followed by steam distillation to release ammonia and receipt in a boric acid solution \n\n(Merck, 1 % m/v with indicator: mixture of methyl red and bromocresol green) and finally is \n\ntitrate with a hydrochloric acid solution (Merck titrisol, 0.1 N). A blank test is perform, following \n\nthe procedure described above, employing the same quantities of all reagents used, except the \n\nproduct to be analyzed. \n\nThe crude protein of the product, expressed in grams per 100 g of the sample is given by: \n\n( )\n\n( )\nF\n\nm\n\nNVV\nba\n\n\u00d7\u00d7?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n? \u00d7?\u00d7\n100\n\n1000\n\n14\n \n\nWhere:  \n\nVa - volume in millilitres of hydrochloric acid solution of known titre, spent in the sample titration;  \n\nVb - volume in millilitres of hydrochloric acid solution of known titre, spent in the blank titration;  \n\nN - concentration, expressed as normality, of  the hydrochloric acid solution;  \n\nm - mass in grams of test sample; \n\nF - conversion factor of Kjeldahl nitrogen in protein (F = 6.25 for fishery products). \n\n \n\nThe result is calculated based on the determination of at least two tests on the same sample. \n\n \n\n5.2.1.3 Fat \n\nExtraction of fat in sample with ethylic ether. Removal of solvent by evaporation, drying and \n\nweighing. \n\nWeigh 10 g of homogenized sample with the accuracy of \u00b1 0.001 g (balance Mettler Toledo, \n\nAG 204).

Cover it with filter paper, fat-free. Place the \n\ncartridge in a Soxhlet extractor. Place a volume of about 80 ml of ethylic ether (Panreac) into a \n\nround-bottom flask, previously dried in an oven for 30 minutes, cooled in desiccators and \n\nweighed, and put also solvent into extractor enough to cover the cartridge. Put the flask with the \n\nextractor in the heating battery (SBS, PC 6L) for 7 hours. After extraction, remove the flask and \n\neliminate the solvent by using a hot plate (Schott-Ger\u00e4te, CK 111) about 35 \u00b0 C. Dry the flask \n\ncontaining the extract in an oven (Memmert, ULE 500) for 30 minutes and, after cooling in \n\ndesiccators, weigh the flask. Repeat these two last operations until constant weight. \n\nThe fat of the product, expressed in grams per 100 g of the sample is given by: \n\n1\n\n23\n\n100\n)(\n\nm\nmm \u00d7?  \n\nWhere: \n\nm1 - mass in grams, of test sample; \n\nm2 - mass in grams, of round-bottom flask; \n\nm3 - mass in grams, of the round-bottom flask with the extract after drying. \n\n \n\nThe result was calculated based on the determination of at least two tests on the same \n\nsample. \n\n \n\n5.2.1.4 Mineral \n\nDrying the sample followed by carbonization and incineration at a temperature of 500 \u00b1 25 \u00b0C. \n\nDetermination of the residue mass. \n\nWeigh 5 g of homogenized sample with the accuracy of \u00b1 0.001 g (balance Mettler Toledo, \n\nAG 204) to crucible, previously dried in an muffle furnace (Heraeus, MR 170E) for 30 minutes, \n\ncooled in desiccators and weighed previously. Put the crucibles for drying the sample in the \n\noven (Cassel) to at least 100\u00b0C overnight. Then, transfer the crucible to the muffle furnace, \n\nraising the temperature very slowly, until 500 \u00b1 25 \u00baC. Let stand for 16 hours (overnight) for \n\nincineration. Remove the crucible from the muffle furnace, cool in desiccator and weigh. \n\nPerform incineration, cooling and weighing operations until two successive weightings do not \n\ndiffer by more than 1 mg. \n\nThe mineral content of the product, expressed in grams per 100 g of the sample is given by: \n\n)(\n\n)(\n\n12\n\n13\n\nmm\n\nmm\n\n?\n\n?\n100\u00d7  \n\nWhere: \n\nm1 - mass in grams, of empty crucible; \n\nm2 - mass in grams, of crucible with test sample; \n\nm3 - mass in grams, of crucible with mineral residue. \n\n \n\nThe result is calculated based on the determination of at least two tests on the same sample. \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n37 \n\n5.2.2 ????-Tocopherol \n\nThe content of ?-tocopherol was determined by the method described by Piironen et al. \n\n(1984). \n\nExtraction of fat from homogenized samples. Dissolution of the oil obtained in n-hexane \n\nfollowed by injection in High Pressure Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC). \n\nThe extraction of fat is based on the method described by Bligh &amp; Dyer (1959). Solutions of \n\nmethanol / chloroform (2:1) (99.8 %, m/m, Merck), saturated sodium chloride (99.5 % m/m, \n\nMerck) and Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT - 99 % m/m, AnalytiCals) solution (50 g/l) with \n\nchloroform (99.8 %, m/m Merck) have to be cooled at 5 \u00ba C before use. Weigh about 12.5 grams \n\n(balance Mettler Toledo, AG 204) of the sample into a tube and added 37.5 ml of methanol / \n\nchloroform solution and stirred between two-seven minutes in the Ultra-Turrax (IKA, T25). After, \n\nadd five ml of saturated sodium chloride solution and homogenized seven minutes in the Ultra-\n\nTurrax. Add 12.5 ml of chloroform with BHT and shake for 30 seconds to five minutes on the \n\nUltra-Turrax. Then, add 12.5 ml of cold ultrapure water and homogenized 30 seconds to five \n\nminutes on the Ultra-Turrax. Put the sample in the ultrasonic bath (Sonorex, DK255P) for 10 \n\nminutes. Filter for a Kitasato, using a Buchner funnel. Transfer the filtrate to a separating funnel. \n\nCollect the organic phase (bottom) filtering with a filter paper over sodium sulphate anhydrous \n\nfor pear-shaped flask previously weighed. Evaporate the chloroform in rotary evaporator (B\u00fcchi, \n\nRE 121) (bath at 40 \u00b0 C, 291 mbar.) Weigh the pear-shaped flasks. Collect a known amount of \n\noil in a known volume of solution of BHT (50 mg/l) in n-hexane (? 98 %, m/m, Merck). Transfer \n\nthe mixture (oil / BHT in n-hexane) to vials for injection. When necessary to concentrate the \n\nsample, evaporate the solvent with the help of an evaporator of samples (Reacti, Therm III) with \n\na stream of nitrogen). Add 100-200 \u00b5l n-hexane and transferred to vials for injection with \n\n\"insert\". \n\nFor chromatographic analysis, inject 20 \u00b5l of the mixture into the HPLC system (Jasco, PU-\n\n980). Selected the wavelengths, excitation 292 nm and emission, 324 nm. Use as mobile phase \n\na mixture of n-hexano/2-propanol (? 99.9 %, m/m, Merck) to 0.7% with a flow rate of 0.5 \n\nml/minute.  \n\nDraw two calibration curves from the readings obtained for solutions 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20 \n\nand 8, 20, 40, 50, 100 and 200 \u00b5 of ?-tocopherol (95 % m/m, Sigma) using as solvent n-hexane. \n\nThe ?-tocopherol is identified by comparison with retention times of standards. The peaks are \n\nintegrated using software Borwin in version 1.2. The calculation of ?-tocopherol content, \n\nexpressed in mg/100 g, is given by the relationship: \n\nm\n\nA\n\n\u00d710\n \n\nwhere: \n\nm - mass in grams, of the test analysis; \n\nA - ?-tocopherol content expressed in g/ml. \n\n \n\nThe result is calculated based on the determination of at least two tests on the same sample. \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n38 \n\n5.2.3 Elemental composition \n\nTechniques of Ultraviolet-Visible absorption spectrometry (UV-Vis), Atomic Absorption \n\nSpectrometry (AAS) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) to analyse chemical \n\nelements were used. These techniques were chosen for being the most suitable for the \n\nelements studied in this work, and also because they are available in the laboratories where the \n\nexperimental part of this thesis were done. Some operating conditions for all elements analysed \n\nby these techniques are shown in Table 5.2 at the subchapter 5.2.3.6. \n\nAll reagents used had a high purity and ultrapure water was used (obtained by the system \n\nMilli-Q Plus Millipore).  \n\n \n\n5.2.3.1 Quantification of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb by flame \n\natomic absorption spectrometry \n\nThe levels of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb were determined by flame \n\natomic absorption spectrofotometry (FAAS), based on the methodology proposed by Jorhem \n\n(2000) and technical procedures in use in the Unit U-VPPA of INRB, IP / L-IPIMAR.  \n\nIncineration of the sample followed by dissolution in nitric acid. After dilution of the sample \n\nproceed to read the content of the element to be determined (K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, \n\nCr, Ni, Cd and Pb) by flame atomic absorption. \n\nFirst, it is necessary to obtain the ash of the sample. For that, weigh 5 g or 10 g of \n\nhomogenized sample (5 g for K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn and 10 g for Cr, NI, Cd and \n\nPb) with the accuracy of \u00b1 0.001 g (balance Mettler Toledo, AG 204) to quartz crucible. Put the \n\ncrucible for drying the sample in the oven (Cassel) to at least 100\u00b0C overnight. Then, transfer \n\nthe crucible to the muffle furnace (Heraeus, MR 170E), raising the temperature very slowly, until \n\n500 \u00b1 25 \u00baC. Let stand for 16 hours (overnight) for incineration. Remove the crucible from the \n\nmuffle furnace and cool in desiccators. Then moisten the ash with nitric acid (65 % m/m, Merck) \n\nand evaporate carefully to dryness on a hot plate (Schott-Ger\u00e4te, CK 111). The crucible is taken \n\nback to the oven at \u00b1 400 \u00b0C for 20-30 minutes to obtain white ash.  \n\nIn the case of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn add 6 ml of nitric acid 15% (v/v) hot to \n\ndissolve the ash and then transfer and filter (Macherey-Nagel 640 w, ? = 7 cm) to a 25 ml \n\nvolumetric flask. Wash the crucible with 6 ml of the same acid and then with ultrapure water. \n\nBoth washing solutions pass through the filter. Cool and volume with ultrapure water. In the \n\ncase of Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb add 3 ml of 15% nitric acid to dissolve the hot ash and then transfer \n\nand filter to a 10 ml volumetric flask. The crucible was washed with 2 ml of the same acid and \n\nthen with ultrapure water. Both washing solutions pass through the filter. Cool and volume with \n\nultrapure water. \n\nRead at the absorption wavelength corresponding to each element and record the maximum \n\nabsorption signal obtained in the atomic absorption apparatus (Varian, Spectr AA 20). \n\nFor the blank, put equal volume of nitric acid to 15% without sample in the adequate \n\nvolumetric flask and make up the final volume with ultrapure water. \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n39 \n\nTo set up the calibration curve, prepare 100 ml of a standard concentration of 10 \u00b5g/ml from \n\nthe standard solution (1000 mg/L, Merck) for each element, using nitric acid as solvent, 5% \n\n(v/v). From the solution of 10 \u00b5g/ml, also called the intermediate solution, prepare five standard \n\nsolutions to use in the calibration curve (calibration solutions). Plot a calibration curve from the \n\nreadings obtained for these solutions. \n\nThe calculation of the content of elements in mg/kg, wet weight is given by: \n\nm\n\nVA )( \u00d7\n \n\nWhere: \n\nA - reading in \u00b5g/ml; \n\nm - mass in grams, of the test sample; \n\nV - volume of the dissolution of the sample. \n\nThe result is given by the arithmetic mean of at least two parallel determinations. \n\n \n\n5.2.3.2 Quantification of Cl, S, Br, Sr, Rb, Se and As by energy dispersive X-ray \n\nfluorescence \n\nThe content of various elements was determined by EDFRX, based on methodology \n\ndescribed by Carvalho et al. (2005) and Cust\u00f3dio et al. (2005), in the laboratory of the Atomic \n\nPhysics Centre of FCUL.  \n\nUse of a X radiation source to ionize internal levels of constituent atoms of the sample. In the \n\nreorganization of the atom and return to the ground state, these atoms can release the excess \n\nenergy through the emission of a photon X, of energy equal to the difference in binding energy \n\nlevels between which the transition occurred. This radiation is characteristic of the element. The \n\ndetection and analysis of this spectrum allows the identification and quantification of \n\nconstituents of the sample. \n\nFirst, it is necessary to obtain the freeze-dried sample. For this, a portion of the frozen sample \n\nis distributed evenly in a Petri dish. It is placed on the freeze-dryer (Edwards, Modulyo Freeze-\n\nDryer) for 48 hours (at a temperature of - 45 \u00b0C and a pressure of about 10\n-1\n\n atmospheres). \n\nAfter, homogenize the freeze-dried samples and again placed in plastic bags properly identified \n\n(species, number), vacuum packed and stored at - 20 \u00b0 C until further analysis. \n\nPut the freeze-dried sample (a coffee spoon) in a cylinder and compress it into a press \n\n(Graseby, Speac) at a pressure of 10 Torr, forming a circular tablet of about 2 cm in diameter \n\nand 1mm thick. Glue the tablet to the Mylar film of the slide (50x50 mm). The choice of these \n\nmaterials is due to the fact that they have low atomic number and its characteristic radiation was \n\nnot detected. Put the slide containing the sample tablet on a stand and link the equipment. This \n\nconsists of a PW 1140 X-ray tube (100kV, 80mA; Phillips, Eindhoven) equipped with a \n\nchangeable molybdenum secondary target and Si(Li) detector (Oxford, High Wycombe). The \n\nenergy resolution is 135 eV at 5.9 keV and the acquisition system is a Nuclear PCA card \n\n(Oxford, High Wycombe). Expose each tablet to radiation during 1000 seconds. The spectrum \n\nis obtained by the Quantum MCA software. \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n40 \n\nFrom the spectra (energy versus intensity) determine the energy corresponding to each \n\nobserved peak. Identify the existing elements in the sample by comparing these energies with \n\nthe theoretical energies corresponding to different elements (Table of X-ray emission energies). \n\nAfter calculating the intensity of each radiation, the concentration of the detected elements is \n\ndetermined by the expression: \n\niiii\nmCcKII\n\n0\n=  \n\nWhere: \n\nIi - X radiation intensity, characteristic of the element i; \n\nI0 - incident radiation intensity; \n\nKi - experimental calibration factor; \n\nci - concentration of element i; \n\nm - sample surface mass (g/cm\n2\n); \n\nCi - damping factor. \n\n \n\nThe quantification is done by the software \"XRF - Quantitative Calculation (fundamental \n\nparameters)\" for Windows. The result of the content of each analyzed element, expressed in mg \n\n/kg wet weight, is calculated taking into account its content in mg/kg dry weight (given by the \n\nsoftware) and moisture of each sample. \n\nThe result is given by the arithmetic mean of at least two parallel determinations. \n\n \n\n5.2.3.3 Quantification of P by Ultraviolet-Visible absorption spectrometry \n\nThe content of P was determined by UV/Vis, based on methodology described in ISO 13730 \n\n(1996). \n\nAll equipment and utensils used in this technique should be free of residues of detergent \n\ncontaining phosphates. Materials have to decontaminate in a solution of 25% hydrochloric acid \n\nfor 24 hours. \n\nDrying the sample and the incineration of residue (500 \u00b1 25 \u00b0C). Acid hydrolysis of the ashes \n\nwith nitric acid, filtration and dilution, followed by formation of a yellow compound after the \n\naddition of a mixture of ammonium monovanadate and ammonium heptamolybdate. \n\nSpectrophotometric measurement at 430 nm. \n\nIn this case it is necessary to have the ash of sample. For that, weigh 5 g of homogenized \n\nsample with the accuracy of \u00b1 0.001 g (balance Mettler Toledo, AG 204) to crucible, previously \n\ndecontaminated. Put the crucible for drying the sample in the oven (Cassel) at least 100\u00b0C \n\novernight. Then, transfer the crucible to the muffle furnace (Heraeus, MR 170E), raising the \n\ntemperature very slowly, until 500 \u00b1 25 \u00baC. Let stand for 16 hours (overnight) for incineration. \n\nRemove the crucible from the muffle furnace and cool in desiccators.  \n\nReconstitute the ash obtained with 10 ml of HNO3 (65 % 1 + 2 ultrapure water , v/v). Cover \n\nthe crucible with a watch glass, put it on the hot plate (Schott-Ger\u00e4te, CK 111), boil about 8 \n\nminutes. Cool and transfer to volumetric flask of 100 ml. Dilute with ultrapure water, mix and \n\nfilter (Macherey-Nagel, GF-1, ? = 10 cm). Pipette a volume V of filtrate (not exceeding 20 ml) \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n41 \n\nfor a volumetric flask of 100 ml, add 30 ml of colorimetric reagent (mix 1 volume of nitric acid \n\nsolution with a volume of solution of ammonium monovanadate (2.5 g/L) and mix. Then add a \n\nvolume of solution of ammonium heptamolybdate (50 g/L) and mix. The colorimetric reagent \n\nshould be pale yellow and completely clear) make up the volume with ultrapure water and let \n\nstand at least 15 min at room temperature. Measure the absorbance of this solution at 430 nm \n\n(quartz cells of 1 cm optical path) in the spectrophotometer (UNICAM UV/Vis UV2) and \n\ncorrected with a blank.  \n\nFor the blank, measure 2 ml of nitric acid solution and 30 ml of colorimetric reagent to a \n\nvolumetric flask of 100 ml, dilute to volume with ultrapure water and mix. \n\nTo set up the calibration curve, measure 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ml of standard phosphate solution \n\n(1000 mg/L, Merck) for volumetric flasks of 100 ml. Add 10 ml of nitric acid solution, dilute to \n\nvolume with ultrapure water and mix. Next, measure 20 ml of each of these standard solutions \n\nof phosphate to 100 ml volumetric flasks, add 30 ml of colorimetric reagent (described above) \n\nmake up the volume with ultrapure water and let stand at least 15 min at room temperature. \n\nThese standard solutions are respectively the concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 \u00b5g of \n\nP2O5/ml. Measure the absorbance of these solutions in the spectrophotometer at 430 nm, \n\ncorrected with the blank. Establish the calibration curve marking the values of absorbance \n\nmeasurements. \n\nThe calculation of phosphorus content, expressed as grams of phosphorus pentoxide per \n\nkilogram of wet weight sample is given by: \n\nV x m\n\nC x 10\n \n\nwhere: \n\nC = concentration of sample solution obtained from the calibration curve in \u00b5g/ml of P2O5; \n\nm = mass of test portion in grams;  \n\nV = volume of filtrate used in the colorimetric determination in ml. \n\n \n\nThe result is given by the arithmetic mean of at least two parallel determinations. \n\n \n\n5.2.3.4 Quantification of total mercury by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry \n\nTotal mercury (HgT) was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy (CVAAS) \n\naccording to the method developed by Hatch &amp; Ott (1968) and described by Joiris et al. (1991). \n\nDigestion of the sample with sulphuric acid. Oxidation of Hg to mercuric ion with potassium \n\npermanganate in acid medium. Reduction of mercuric ion to elemental form with tin chloride. \n\nThe vaporized Hg is put into circulation in the cell absorption spectrophotometer using a bubbler \n\nsystem. The readings are made at the absorption wavelength of 253.7 nm. \n\nWeigh approximately 1 g of homogenized sample with accuracy of 0.001 g (balance Mettler \n\nToledo, AG 204) to Erlenmeyer flasks of 150 ml. Add 20 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid (95-\n\n97 %, Merck) carefully and shaking slightly. Then place the Erlenmeyer flasks in an oven \n\n(Durocell, Model 55) set at 60 \u00b1 2 \u00ba C for 6 hours. After cooling, place the Erlenmeyer flasks in a \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n42 \n\ntank with water, cooled with ice, and add about 25 ml (or more if necessary) of a solution of \n\npotassium permanganate (5 % m/v, Merck) to provide persistent purple colour. After a period 3-\n\n4 hours, transfer carefully to a 300 ml flask already containing 30 ml of distilled water. Add \n\nwashings of Erlenmeyer flasks of 150 ml, until a total volume of 100 ml. After, add 5 ml of a \n\nsolution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (1.5 % m/v, Merck). After decolourization of the sample, \n\nadd 2-3 ml of a solution of tin chloride (II) (20 % m/v in hydrochloric acid 20 % (v/v) Merck) and \n\nintroduce the bubbler of the spectrometer (Bacharach, Coleman MAS 50D) into to the flask of \n\n300 ml, quickly adjusting to the whole system and without leaks. Finally, there is the maximum \n\nabsorption obtained by the equipment at 253.7 nm. \n\nThe blank is carried out on 100 ml of distilled water by adding a few drops of potassium \n\npermanganate, and proceeding in an identical manner as for a sample. \n\nFor the calibration curve, prepare intermediate Hg solutions of 10 \u00b5g/ml and 0.1 \u00b5g/ml in 0.5 \n\nM HNO3, using the standard solution 1000 ug/ml (Merck). Draw two calibration curves obtained \n\nfrom the readings of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 ml and 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5, 0 ml, prepared \n\nfrom standard solution of 0.1 \u00b5g/ml, corresponding values of 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.08 and 0.1 g/ml \n\n(low range) and 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 g/ml (high range), respectively. The quantification is \n\ndone by the software \"MercuReport II\u201d, vers\u00e3o 1.00, XRF, 1994, Bacharach, Inc., USA, for \n\nWindows. \n\nThe calculation of the HgT content in mg/kg, wet weight is given by: \n\nm\n\nA\n \n\nWhere: \n\nA - reading in \u00b5g; \n\nm - mass in grams, of the test sample. \n\n \n\nThe result is given by the arithmetic mean of at least two parallel determinations. \n\n \n\n5.2.3.5 Quantification of organic mercury by atomic absorption spectrometry \n\nThe determination of organic mercury (HgOrg) was based on the method described by Scerbo \n\n&amp; Barghigiani (1998). \n\nHydrolysis of the freeze-dried sample with hydrobromic acid followed by extraction of organic \n\ncompounds with toluene. Removal of organic compounds of Hg using a solution of cysteine. \n\nThermal and chemical decomposition of the sample (cysteine containing organic compounds of \n\nHg) in the oven of the Hg analyser. Selective retention of Hg in an amalgam of gold then \n\nrelease after heating. Trawling of Hg vapour by oxygen through cell absorption \n\nspectrophotometer. Reading the absorption at a wavelength of 253.7 nm. \n\nFirst, it is necessary to obtain the freeze-dried sample. For this, a portion of the frozen sample \n\nis distributed evenly in a Petri dish. It is placed on the freeze-dryer (Edwards, Modulyo Freeze-\n\nDryer) for 48 hours (at a temperature of - 45 \u00b0C and a pressure of about 10\n-1\n\n atmospheres). \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n43 \n\nAfter, homogenize the freeze-dried samples and again placed in plastic bags properly identified \n\n(species, number), vacuum packed and stored at - 20 \u00b0 C until further analysis. \n\nWeigh about 200 mg of freeze-dried sample (balance Mettler Toledo, AG 204) to a centrifuge \n\ntube (FEP with screw cap of ETFE, Nalgene). Add 10 ml of hydrobromic acid (47 % m/m, \n\nMerck) and 20 ml of toluene (? 99 % m/m, Merck). Stir the mixture in a vortex (Heidolph, ReAX) \n\nfor about 5 minutes and centrifuge (Sigma, 3K29) for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. Remove 15 ml of \n\norganic phase and placed into another tube which was previously added 6 ml of cysteine \n\nsolution (1 % L-cysteine hydrochloride, monohydrate in 12.5 % of sodium sulphate and 0.8 % of \n\nsodium acetate, all Merck). Add 15 ml of toluene to the tube containing the initial hydrobromic \n\nacid and repeat the process. Finally, shake (manually and vortex) the tube containing the \n\nsolution of cysteine and toluene (30 ml) and centrifuge for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. Transfer to \n\nanother centrifuge tube 3 ml of cysteine for subsequent analysis. From this solution withdraw \n\nbetween 100 a 500 \u00b5l in a small boat. Put the small boat on Hg analyzer and read according to \n\nthe instructions of the Hg analyser (LECO, AMA 254). The blank is carried out as described \n\nabove except the step of weighing the sample that were not made. It is accepted the calibration \n\ncurve introduced into the Hg analyzer software (0.10, 0.30, 1.00, 3.00, 10.00, 20.00, 30.00, \n\n36.00 ng of Hg). To verify the calibration curve prepare one intermediate Hg solution of 10 \u00b5g/ml \n\nin 1% of HNO3, using the standard solution 1000 mg/L (Merck). After, prepare two standard \n\nsolutions  of  0.1 \u00b5g/ml  and  0.005 \u00b5g/ml  to  read in the mercury analyser. \n\nThe calculation of HgOrg level, expressed as a percentage, is given by the relationship:  \n\n( )\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\u00d7\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n\u00d7\n\n?\u00d7\n\nc\nf\n\nm\n\nba\nVa 100\n\n6\n\n \n\nWhere: \n\nVa - sample volume, in \u00b5l, analysed in the equipment; \n\na - concentration read on ng of the sample; \n\nb - concentration read, on ng of the blank; \n\nm - mass in grams, of the test analysis; \n\nc - concentration read in mg/kg dry weight, of HgT ; \n\nf - correction factor (f = 1.07) \n\n \n\nThe result is given by the arithmetic mean of at least two parallel determinations. \n\n \n\n5.2.3.6 - Summary of operating conditions in the elemental composition analyses \n\nIn Table 5.2 it can be observed some operating conditions in the elemental composition \n\nanalyses. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n44 \n\nTable 5.2 - Operating conditions in the elemental composition analyses. \n\nElement Technique Apparatus Conditions Standard Typical \n\ncalibration curve \n\nDL \n\n(mg/kg) \n\nCRM* \n\nused \n\nBr EDXRF Philips, PW \n\n2184/00 \n\n- - - 0.8 - \n\nCa FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 422.7 nm; \n\nI = 10 mA, Slit \n\n= 0.5 nm \n\nCa(N03)2,1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.2457x + \n\n0.0073 \n\n0.08 LUTS-1 \n\nSMRD-\n\n2000 \n\nCl EDXRF Philips, PW \n\n2184/00 \n\n- - - 10 - \n\nCd FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 228.8 nm; \n\nI = 4 mA, Slit = \n\n0.5 nm \n\nCd(N03)2,,1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.1781x + \n\n0.0003 \n\n0.01 TORT-2 \n\nDORM-2 \n\nCr FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 357.9 nm; \n\nI = 4 mA, Slit = \n\n0.2 nm \n\nCr(N03)3,,1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.0805x + \n\n0.0015 \n\n0.09 TORT-2 \n\nDORM-2 \n\nCu FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 324.8 nm; \n\nI = 4 mA, Slit = \n\n0.5 nm \n\nCu(N03)2 ,1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.1239x + \n\n0.0004 \n\n0.02 LUTS-1 \n\nDORM-2 \n\nFe FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 248.3 nm; \n\nI = 5 mA, Slit = \n\n0.2 nm \n\nFe(N03)3, 1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.0813x + \n\n0.0074 \n\n0.32 LUTS-1 \n\nSMRD-\n\n2000 \n\nHgT CVAAS Bacharach, \n\nMAS-50 D \n\n? = 253.7 nm Hg(N03)2 1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 3,348*10\n-4\nx+ \n\n4.249*10\n-3\n \n\n0.01 TORT-2 \n\nDORM-2 \n\nHgOrg AAS LECO, AMA \n\n254 \n\n? = 248.3 nm; \n\nI = 5 mA,  \n\nHg(N03)2 1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 31.87x + \n\n0.0381 \n\n DORM-2 \n\nCRM-463 \n\nK FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 766.5 nm; \n\nI = 5 mA, Slit = \n\n1 nm \n\nKN03,1000 mg/L, \n\nMerck \n\ny = 0.3888x - \n\n0.0011 \n\n0.01 LUTS-1 \n\nSMRD-\n\n2000 \n\nMg FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 285.2 nm; \n\nI = 4 mA, Slit = \n\n0.5 nm \n\nMg(N03)2, 1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 1.3149x + \n\n0.0054 \n\n0.02 LUTS-1 \n\nMn FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 279.5 nm; \n\nI = 5 mA, Slit = \n\n0.2 nm \n\nMn(N03)2, 1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.2036x + \n\n0.0012 \n\n0.01 TORT-2 \n\nDORM-2 \n\nNa FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 589.0 nm; \n\nI = 5 mA, Slit = \n\n0.5 nm \n\nNaN03,1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.5863x + \n\n0.0195 \n\n0.09 SMRD-\n\n2000 \n\nNi FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 232.0 nm; \n\nI = 4 mA, Slit = \n\n0.2 nm \n\nNi(N03)2, 1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.0902x + \n\n0.0004 \n\n0.02 LUTS-1 \n\nDORM-2 \n\nP UV/Vis Unicam, UV \n\n5 220 \n\n? = 430.0 nm PO4\n3-\n\n 1000 mg/L, \n\nMerck \n\ny = 0.0186x + \n\n0.0008 \n\n0.01 SMRD-\n\n2000 \n\nPb FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 217.0 nm; \n\nI = 10 mA, Slit \n\n= 1 nm \n\nPb(N03)2, 1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.0368x + \n\n0.0021 \n\n0.02 TORT-2 \n\nDORM-2 \n\nRb EDXRF Philips, PW \n\n2184/00 \n\n- - - 1.1 - \n\n        \n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\n \n\n45 \n\nContinuation of Table 5.2 \n\nElement Technique Apparatus Conditions Standard Typical \n\ncalibration curve \n\nDL \n\n(mg/kg) \n\nCRM* \n\nused \n\nS EDXRF Philips, PW \n\n2184/00 \n\n- - - 10 - \n\nSe EDXRF Philips, PW \n\n2184/00 \n\n- - - 0.6 DORM-2 \n\nMA-A-2 \n\nSr EDXRF Philips, PW \n\n2184/00 \n\n- - - 0.5 TORT-2 \n\nZn FAAS Varian, \n\nSpectr AA-20 \n\n? = 213.9 nm; \n\nI = 5 mA, Slit = \n\n1 nm \n\nZn(N03)2, 1000 \n\nmg/L, Merck \n\ny = 0.4484x + \n\n0.01 \n\n0.06 TORT-2 \n\nDORM-2 \n\n* Certified Reference Material (results are shown in Papers). \n\n \n\n5.2.4 - Handling of the data \n\n5.2.4.1 Risk analysis \n\nToxic metals\u2019 risks to human health are assessed by comparing the weekly intake level with \n\nan appropriate safe exposure level, the PTWI for each toxic metal (Renwick et al. 2003). That \n\nis, assessing the probability of the intake level exceeding the respective PTWI value. There are \n\ntwo alternatives for estimating the risk; the plug-in (PI) and the tail estimation (TE) based \n\nestimators (Tressou et al. 2004). Both were used, the PI estimator for large probabilities and the \n\nTE estimator for the other situations (especially, for very low probabilities). The statistical \n\nmethodology based on the extreme value theory (which has found application in various \n\nscientific fields, such as hydrology) was applied to the MeHg data of cephalopod species. This \n\nanalysis is described in detail in the Paper VI and also in Cardoso et al. (2010b). \n\n \n\n5.2.4.2 Statistical Analysis \n\nThe statistical treatment of the data was performed using the STATISTICA 6.1 software (Stat \n\nsoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK74104, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Lilliefors-test and the Levene\u00b4s \n\ntest were used to check the normality and the homogeneity of variance of data, respectively \n\n(Zar, 1999). Data that corroborate these assumptions were analysed by Student t-test or single \n\nfactor ANOVA analysis to evaluate the influence of some factors like sex or age groups on the \n\nconcentrations of various elements, for each species. Comparisons were made using Kruskall-\n\nWallis test when the conditions were nonparametric. In some cases data logarithmic \n\ntransformation was applied to reduce the wide range of values. The Pearson correlation \n\nbetween elements of each species was determined. The significance level for statistical \n\nanalyses was always tested at ? = 0.05 (p &lt;0.05). These analyses are described in detail in \n\nPapers I, II, III, IV, V and VII. \n\n \n\n\n\nFinal Discussion \n\n \n\n46 \n\n6 FINAL DISCUSSION \n\nIn this chapter it is intended to summarize the main results obtained on the selected species, \n\nwhich are versed in the nine papers incorporated in this thesis. \n\n \n\n6.1 Cephalopods \n\nCephalopods are part of the traditional diet of coastal communities in southern European \n\ncountries. In Portugal, they are important targeted species in fisheries, specially octopus, that \n\nhas a high economic, social and culture value. The results obtained for proximate composition \n\nshowed that they are a good source of protein (levels around 19%) and have an appreciable \n\nmineral content (about 2%). The fat level was very low (<1%) and consequently they can be \n\nconsidered lean species. These results are similar to those observed by other authors (Favier et \n\nal. 1995; Bandarra et al., 2005). From paper I, it can be concluded that they are a good source \n\nof essential elements (mainly S, P, Zn and Cu) and, in general, their contents are in the same \n\norder of magnitude as those reported by other authors (Table 6.1). However, in the case of Zn, \n\nFe and Cu, values may be different due to different sizes of the specimens and also due to \n\ndifferent testing methodologies. Most part of the elements can be assumed to be incorporated \n\nby the diet because cephalopods are know to be carnivorous, active predators and have very \n\nhigh feeding rates (Villanueva &amp; Bustamante, 2006). This may explain the high values of almost \n\nessential elements, particularly in the case of the octopus. Octopuses usually consume \n\ncrustaceans (Smith, 2003), like crabs, that contain high levels of these elements. However, \n\nabsorption also takes place from seawater. Until know, no data on the respective proportions of \n\nthe elements incorporated from food and seawater has been published for cephalopods. \n\nNevertheless, a similar behaviour to that of fish is expected to have place in cephalopods. \n\nAmong the three cephalopods, squid shows the lowest concentrations of most essential \n\nelements. According to some authors (Guerra &amp; Rocha, 1994; Coelho et al., 1997) fish is \n\nalways the main component of the squid diet, representing about 90 % of the prey found in their \n\nstomachs. This may explain the low values of essential elements in this species, since fish \n\ncontains fewer minerals than crustaceans, preferred prey of the octopus. Unlike fish, K in \n\ncephalopods is low, and in the case of the octopus, is below the level of Na. In general, Na \n\ncontents are considerably higher in shellfish than in finfish (Vlieg et al., 1991). Thus, the ratio \n\nNa/K in octopus is high (2.6), which can be seen as an increased risk of developing \n\ncardiovascular disease and high blood pressure (Astorga Espa\u00f1a et al., 2007). \n\nAlthough the levels of essential elements are lower in squid, the three studied species can \n\nhave a good contribution to the DRI of these elements, especially with regard to the Cu, S, P, \n\nCl, Zn and Mg (Table 6.2), considering the DRI for adults. \n\nTaking into consideration the limits set by EU (2006, 2008) for Hg, Pb and Cd, the mean \n\nlevels detected of these toxic elements in cephalopods were always lower, although some \n\nspecimens of octopus and cuttlefish (about 10 %) has shown high levels of Cd. This occurs very \n\noften in cephalopods, since these animals have the ability to concentrate Cd in the \n\n\n\nFinal Discussion \n\n \n\n47 \n\nT\na\n\nb\nle\n\n 6\n.1\n\n-\nC\n\no\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\no\n\nn\n o\n\nf \nm\n\na\nc\nro\n\n e\nle\n\nm\ne\n\nn\nts\n\n (\nK\n\n, \nN\n\na\n, \n\nP\n, \n\nS\n, \n\nM\ng\n\n a\nn\n\nd\n C\n\na\n) \n\ne\nx\np\n\nre\ns\ns\ne\nd\n\n a\ns\n g\n\n/k\ng\n\n (\nw\n\ne\nt \n\nw\ne\n\nig\nh\n\nt)\n, \n\ntr\na\n\nc\ne\n\n e\nle\n\nm\ne\n\nn\nts\n\n (\nZ\n\nn\n, \n\nF\ne\n\n a\nn\nd\n\n C\nu\n\n),\n u\n\nlt\nra\n\n t\nra\n\nc\ne\n\ne\nle\n\nm\ne\n\nn\nts\n\n  \n(M\n\nn\n, \nN\n\ni \na\n\nn\nd\n\n S\ne\n\n) \na\n\nn\nd\n\n t\no\n\nx\nic\n\n e\nle\n\nm\ne\nn\n\nts\n (\n\nA\ns\n, \n\nC\nd\n\n, \nH\n\ng\n a\n\nn\nd\n\n P\nb\n\n) \n e\n\nx\np\n\nre\ns\ns\ne\n\nd\n  \na\n\ns\n m\n\ng\n/k\n\ng\n (\n\nw\ne\n\nt \nw\n\ne\nig\n\nh\nt)\n\n  \na\n\ns\n  \n\nre\np\no\n\nrt\ne\n\nd\n  \n\nin\n t\n\nh\ne\n\n l\nit\ne\n\nra\ntu\n\nre\n f\n\no\nr \n\nc\ne\n\np\nh\na\n\nlo\np\n\no\nd\n\n s\np\n\ne\nc\nie\n\ns\n. \n\n \n\n \n\nC\nep\n\nh\nal\n\no\np\n\no\nd\n\ns \nG\n\neo\ng\n\nra\np\n\nh\nic\n\nal\n a\n\nre\na \n\nK\n \n\nN\na \n\nP\n \n\nS\n \n\nM\ng\n\n \nC\n\na \nZ\n\nn\n \n\nF\ne \n\nC\nu\n\n \nM\n\nn\n \n\nN\ni \n\nS\ne \n\nA\ns \n\nC\nd\n\n \nH\n\ng\n \n\nP\nb\n\n \nR\n\nef\ner\n\nen\nce\n\n \n\nS\np\n\nec\nie\n\ns:\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nL\no\n\nlig\no\n\n v\nu\n\nlg\na\n\nri\ns\n \n\nM\ne\n\nd\nit\ne\n\nrr\na\n\nn\ne\n\na\nn\n S\n\ne\na\n\n, \n\nS\np\n\na\nin\n\n \n\n2\n.6\n\n \n3\n\n.9\n \n\n2\n.2\n\n \n4\n\n.7\n \n\n0\n.6\n\n2\n \n\n0\n.3\n\n6\n \n\n1\n2\n\n.4\n \n\n1\n5\n\n.2\n \n\n1\n0\n\n.1\n \n\n0\n.4\n\n9\n \n\n<\n 0\n\n.1\n \n\n- \n3\n\n.1\n \n\n0\n.0\n\n6\n \n\n0\n.0\n\n4\n \n\n0\n.1\n\n2\n \n\nV\nil\nla\n\nn\nu\n\ne\nv\na\n\n &amp;\n \n\nB\nu\n\ns\nta\n\nm\na\n\nn\nte\n\n (\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n) \n\nL\no\n\nlig\no\n\n v\nu\n\nlg\na\n\nri\ns\n \n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n O\n\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\n, \n\nP\no\n\nrt\nu\n\ng\na\nl \n\n2\n.6\n\n \n1\n\n.6\n \n\n2\n.6\n\n \n2\n\n.3\n \n\n0\n.4\n\n4\n \n\n0\n.1\n\n4\n \n\n1\n2\n\n.6\n \n\n1\n.7\n\n \n1\n\n.5\n \n\n0\n.1\n\n6\n \n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n \n\n<\n 0\n\n.4\n \n\n4\n.0\n\n \n0\n\n.0\n4\n\n \n0\n\n.0\n5\n\n \n0\n\n.1\n0\n\n \nP\n\nre\ns\ne\n\nn\nt \n\nw\no\n\nrk\n \n\nO\nc\nto\n\np\nu\ns\n v\n\nu\nlg\n\na\nri\n\ns\n \n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n O\n\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\n, \n  \n\nS\np\n\na\nin\n\n \n\n- \n- \n\n- \n- \n\n- \n- \n\n1\n2\n\n.1\n \n\n5\n.7\n\n \n6\n\n.3\n \n\n0\n.3\n\n9\n \n\n- \n- \n\n- \n- \n\n- \n- \n\nS\no\n\nld\ne\n\nv\nil\nla\n\n e\nt \n\na\nl.\n \n\n(1\n9\n\n8\n7\n\n) \n\nO\nc\nto\n\np\nu\ns\n v\n\nu\nlg\n\na\nri\n\ns\n \n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n O\n\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\n, \n\nP\no\n\nrt\nu\n\ng\na\nl \n\n- \n- \n\n- \n- \n\n- \n- \n\n1\n0\n\n-6\n0\n\n \n9\n\n \n0\n\n.8\n-4\n\n0\n \n0\n\n.3\n-0\n\n.5\n \n\n- \n0\n\n.2\n-0\n\n.4\n \n\n8\n-2\n\n6\n \n\nN\nd\n\n*\n-4\n\n 0\n.0\n\n3\n-0\n\n.0\n9\n\n \n0\n\n.6\n-0\n\n.8\n \n\nS\ne\n\nix\na\n\ns\n e\n\nt \na\n\nl.\n (\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n5\n\n) \n\nO\nc\nto\n\np\nu\ns\n v\n\nu\nlg\n\na\nri\n\ns\n \n\nA\ntl\na\n\nn\nti\nc\n O\n\nc\ne\n\na\nn\n\n \n\nP\no\n\nrt\nu\n\ng\na\nl \n(3\n\n a\nre\n\na\ns\n) \n\n \n\n- -

The levels of these metals in squid samples, especially Cd, were always very \n\nlow. This different behaviour is probably due to their diet and also to the different habitat. Mean \n\nvalues of As presented similar pattern: octopus showed the highest values and squid showed \n\nthe lowest ones (VII), possibly due to the same facts. Taking into account the different PTWIs, \n\nthe consumption of cephalopods does not pose a hazard to human diet, albeit moderation is \n\nrecommended in the case of cuttlefish and octopus (Table 6.3) for which four or five meals per \n\nweek should not be achieved taking into consideration the HgOrg levels. \n\nThe results allow to draw a general recommendation for the consumption of these species \n\n(Fig. 6.1). \n\n \n\n6.2 Crustacean \n\nCrustaceans have been lauded for their health promoting characteristics. Norway lobster had \n\na low fat and high protein and mineral contents, with a low energy value. These characteristics \n\nmake this species interesting from a nutritional standpoint. Generally, other crustaceans, as \n\nblue crab and Atlantic spider crab, showed a similar proximate composition (G\u00f6ko\u00f0lu &amp; \n\nYerlikaya, 2003; K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckg\u00fclmez et al., 2006; Marques et al., 2010). They are nutritional valuable \n\nsources of various minerals (K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckg\u00fclmez et al., 2006) as can be seen in Table 6.4. Related \n\npublications on these elements concentrations in similar crustacean species also reveal high \n\nvalues  of essential  elements, however  there are  some  differences.

The skeleton needs to shed regularly to allow increase in body \n\nsize (Greenaway, 1985). High levels of Cu, Fe and Zn are also found in this species (however \n\nlower than the levels referred for other species). This is probably due to the fact that Norway \n\nlobster is a species that feeds on benthic sediments that are generally rich in trace elements. \n\nHigh levels of Cu are probably due to the requirement of this element by the respiratory pigment  \n\n \n\n\n\nFinal Discussion \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 - General recommendations for cephalopods consumption.

According to the levels of essential elements found, this \n\ncrustacean is a good contribution for the DRI of most essential elements (Table 6.2). However, \n\nthe level of Cu greatly exceeds the DRI. Nevertheless, there is no problem in relation to \n\nconsumption of this species because the estimated UL for Cu (IOM, 2005) is 10mg/day and the \n\ncalculated value in this thesis is 1.7 mg/day (a meal of 160 g). \n\nRegarding toxic elements (II), Norway lobster showed low mean values of Pb and Cd, inferior \n\nto EU limits (EU, 2006, 2008), being the estimated weekly intake, based on a 160 g portion per \n\nday and a person of 60 kg BW, also lower than the respectively PTWI (Table 6.3). \n\nNevertheless, this species presented high levels of Hg (total and organic - about 78 % of total) \n\nand As (II, VII). These contents of Hg and As can be attributed to its habitat. In fact, this species \n\nusually lives in muddy sediments that always contain high levels of these elements and \n\nfurthermore this species is considered a scavenger (Barghigiani et al., 2000). In this case, EDI \n\nof HgT and HgOrg exceeded the PTWI. \n\n \n\nBenefits\n\n\u2022 Low fat\n\n\u2022 Low energy value\n\n\u2022 High levels of S, P, Mg, Zn and Cu\n\n\u2022 Low levels of

Turbot was the species that revealed the lowest mineral content. The apparent reason \n\nfor this difference seems to be the diet. Some species contributed to more than 50 % for P, 19% \n\nfor Mg and 17 % for K DRIs (European seabass and trout) (Table 6.2). Chromium percentages \n\nof farmed fish are above the DRI (more than 100 %). However, according to the Council for \n\nresponsible Nutrition (CRN) (Hathcock, 2004), Cr supplements at levels up to 1,000 \u00b5g per day \n\nare regarded as safe for adults. Such limit is above the results found in this study (maximum: \n\n0.05 mg Cr in a portion of 160 g). Considering the contaminant elements (As, Cd, Hg and Pb), \n\nfarmed fish showed low values (III, VII). Thus, estimated weekly intakes were consistently lower \n\nthan the PTWI set by WHO/FAO (WHO, 1999, 2003a), except for HgOrg (only analyzed in \n\nsamples  of gilthead seabream). However, there seems to be no problem because it is possible \n\nto get six meals without reaching the PTWI, which is unlikely to accomplish.

Blackbelly rosefish \n\nand black scabbardfish studied in this thesis (IV-V) showed high levels of HgT. Comparing the \n\nobserved values with those of other authors (Table 6.6) it is verified that, in general, the levels \n\nof HgT are similar for black scabbardfish although the geographic area is different. With regard \n\nto blackbelly rosefish, values obtained in this study were higher than those recorded in studies \n\nconducted by Monteiro et al. (1991) and Andersen &amp; Depledge (1997). This finding may be due \n\nto the fact that the specimens studied are larger than those in the two other studies. Organic \n\nmercury levels were about 86 % of the HgT for both species. Similar percentages for other \n\ndeep-water fish species were obtained by others (Andersen &amp; Depledge, 1997; Storelli et al., \n\n2003, 2005; Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2007). Significant positive correlations between HgT and length \n\nwere found, which is in agreement with the results presented by Monteiro et al. (1991), \n\nAndersen &amp; Depledge (1997) and Bebiano et al. (2007). It is also noted that the levels of HgT \n\nobserved for black scabbardfish caught off the Azores and Madeira were significantly higher \n\nthan those caught off the mainland. This is mainly due to the fact, of Azores and Madeira being \n\nvolcanic regions and for that a potential source of Hg. Given the high levels of Hg, the molar \n\nratio of Se:Hg was determined and the values were superior to one. Such value indicated that \n\nthe absorption of Hg can be counteract by Se. Similar ratios were reported (Andersen &amp; \n\nDepledge, 1997; Plessi et al., 2001; Caba\u00f1ero et al., 2004). According the limits fixed by EU \n\n(2006, 2008) for HgT (1.0 mg/kg for black scabbardfish and 0.50 mg/kg for blackbelly rosefish), \n\nit was found that some specimens showed concentrations above the limits (30 % and 70 %, \n\nrespectively). Taking into consideration these results, estimated weekly intakes of HgT and \n\nHgOrg exceeded the PTWI (Table 6.3) and the consumption of the two species should not \n\nexceed one meal per week. On the other hand, mean levels of Cd and Pb in muscle \n\nsampleswere lower than the limits proposed by EU (2006, 2008) (data not showed for blackbelly \n\nrosefish). This pattern was also verified by other authors (Table 6.6). Total arsenic for both \n\nspecies were considered low when compared with other species (VII) and are in accordance \n\nwith Mormede &amp; Davies (2001). Thus, these latter three elements do not pose any problem to \n\nthe consumption of these two species (Table 6.3). A draw of general recommendations for \n\nconsumption of both species, is given in Figure 6.4. \n\n \n\n6.5 Bivalves \n\nBivalves, as the other marine organisms, are a good source of nutrients. The consumption of \n\nsome species provides a source of protein for human consumption (Astorga Espa\u00f1a et al., \n\n2007). But, on the other hand, they are filter or deposit feeders; therefore, they can absorb toxic \n\nelements not  only from food and water, but also from inorganic particulate materials they ingest \n\n(\u00d6zden et al., 2009). For that reason, many researchers have reported the potentiality of using \n\nbivalves as  bioindicators or  biomarkers for  monitoring  toxic metals  contaminations  in aquatic  \n\n\n\nFinal Discussion \n\n \n\n56 \n\nTable 6.6 - Concentration of toxic elements (As, Cd, Hg and Pb) expressed as mg/kg (wet \n\nweight) as reported in the literature for deep-water fish species. \n\nDeep-water \nfish \n\nGeographical area As Cd Hg Pb Reference \n\nSpecies:       \n\nAphanopus \ncarbo \n\nAtlantic Ocean, Portugal \n\nAzores \n\nMadeira \n\n \n\n- \n\n- \n\n \n\n0.03 \n\n0.01 \n\n \n\n0.89 \n\n0.90 \n\n \n\n0.04 \n\n0.02 \n\n \n\nAfonso et \nal.

The results obtained in this thesis (VIII) \n\nillustrated the contamination level of production areas localised along the Portuguese coastal \n\nzone and estuaries. Total Hg levels were always very low (below 0.1 mg/kg) being the highest \n\nvalues observed in bivalves from the Tagus estuary. However, the concentrations found are \n\nwell below the limit proposed by the EU, 0.5 mg/kg (2006, 2008). Similar values were found in \n\nother papers (Table 6.7). Furthermore, bivalves do not normally contain high concentrations of \n\nHg because they are low on the trophic chain and have a short life cycle (Guti\u00e9rrez et al., \n\n2006).The results also leads to the conclusion that the areas studied are not be sources of \n\nanthropogenic  Hg.

(Picture source sites: \n\nFishbase; Cozinha sem tabus) \n\n \n\nfurrow shell of the Tagus estuary and some oysters of the Sado estuary showed very high \n\nlevels of Pb and Cd,  respectively (above the  limits  set for these species). Like otherestuaries, \n\nTagus and Sado ones, are most intensively used and one of the most  vulnerable coastal areas. \n\nThey receive a multitude of inputs from point and diffusive sources (Blasco et al., 1999, Fran\u00e7a \n\net al., 2005). Thus, these results indicate some pollution in these two estuaries, which is \n\nreflected in the bivalves living inside these areas. Furthermore, the furrow shell is considered a \n\nspecies that is a burrowing and a deposit-feeding bivalve, which may explain the high levels of \n\nPb.

Their consumption is somewhat privileged because of its convenient and affordable \n\nuse for most working families. These products, generally reflect the profile of raw-material, and \n\ntherefore may also contain toxic elements. However, it is noteworthy that the processing steps \n\ncan alter the concentration of toxic metals in fish prior to consumption (Rasmussen et al., 2007; \n\nAdvisable consumption\n\nUp to 6 meal per week\n\nBenefits\n\n\u2022 Low fat*\n\n\u2022 High levels of Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn*\n\n\u2022 Low levels of Hg\n\nHazards\n\n\u2022 High levels of Cd or Pb\n\nFurrow shell\n\n(Scrobicularia plana)\n\nPortuguese oyster\n\n(Crassostrea angulata)\n\nMussel\n\n(Mytilus edulis)\n\nMain Facts\n\nAdvisable consumption\n\nUp to 6 meal per week\n\nBenefits\n\n\u2022 Low fat*\n\n\u2022 High levels of Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn*\n\n\u2022 Low levels of Hg\n\nHazards\n\n\u2022 High levels of Cd or Pb\n\nFurrow shell\n\n(Scrobicularia plana)\n\nPortuguese oyster\n\n(Crassostrea angulata)\n\nMussel\n\n(Mytilus edulis)\nFurrow shell\n\n(Scrobicularia plana)\n\nPortuguese oyster\n\n(Crassostrea angulata)\n\nMussel\n\n(Mytilus edulis)\n\nMain Facts\n\n\n\nFinal Discussion \n\n \n\n60 \n\nGanjavi et al., 2010). In general, Portuguese canned seafood studied in this thesis, did not show \n\nmean high levels of the three toxic metals (IX).

Canned \n\nmolluscs, especially of squid, showed the highest levels of Cd. Papers published on levels of \n\ntoxic metals in canned shellfish are scarce. However, there are few that also mention the high \n\nvalues of Cd, principally in canned squid (Table 6.8). These high values are attributed to the \n\npresence of visceral tissue in this kind of canned seafood (Galitsopoulou et al., 2009). Mercury \n\nlevels were always very low and did not exceed the limits of 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg\n-1\n\n, according to \n\nthe species (EU, 2006, 2008). The exception occurred in some samples (around 0.5 %) of \n\ncanned tuna that reached the proposed limit. These high figures are mainly due to the feeding \n\nbehaviour of tuna, since it is a very voracious and predatory species (Khansari et al., 2005; \n\nStorelli et al., 2010). Probably, these Hg contents are also increased by the canning process \n\n(Rasmussen et al., 2007) due to water release. There are several studies on Hg in canned tuna \n\n(Table 6.8). Overall, the Hg values vary somewhat, but are similar to those reported in this \n\nthesis. Differences are possibly due to different species of tuna, of different sizes and different \n\ncapture sites, more or less polluted. According to the Table 6.3, only canned tuna slightly \n\nexceeded the estimated weekly intake for HgT, however the maximum number of meals \n\nallowed, six, seems unlikely in the Portuguese diet. Some consumption recommendations are \n\ngenerally described in Figure 6.6. \n\n \n\n6.7 Risk assessment of seafood consumption \n\nThe simultaneous assessment of risks and benefits in seafood has been subject of various \n\nstudies (Cohen et al., 2005; Domingo et al., 2007; van der Voet et al., 2007; Gladyshev et al., \n\n2009; Sioen et al., 2009). In this thesis, the hazard MeHg was chosen, since it is the component \n\nwhose effects are most likely to contribute substantially to health impacts associated with \n\nseafood consumption. The results for the cephalopods group (VI) showed that squid presented \n\nthe  lowest  risk, being  octopus\u00b4 risk  the  higest as a result of higher MeHg content and greater  \n\n\n\nFinal Discussion \n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.6 - General recommendations for canned seafood consumption. *Bandarra et al., \n\n2004.

Thus, whereas for squid no consumption restriction seems necessary, for \n\ncuttlefish and octopus an ideal maximal consumption of two meals per week must be advised. \n\nOther studies about risk assessment of methyl-Hg intake trough seafood were already done \n\n(Tressou et al., 2004; Cardoso et al., 2010a, 2010b). Regarding black scabbardfish, it was \n\nfound  (Cardoso et al., 2010a) that  people  who consume  two or three  meals per week, have a \n\nhigh probability of being overly exposed to MeHg, about 1:55. This result confirms the data \n\nshown previously (Paper IV) that the black scabbardfish should be eaten sparingly. Another \n\nstudy (Cardoso et al., 2010b), conceptualized to compare the risks and benefits associated to \n\nthe consumption of the five most consumed seafood species in Portugal (cod, hake, sardine, \n\nhorse mackerel and tuna), indicated that tuna and hake yielded the maximum probability of \n\nexceeding the MeHg PTWI, but somehow they are still considered negligible. The results also \n\nshow that probabilities of surpassing the MeHg PTWI were lower than those of exceeding the \n\nEPA + DHA recommended daily intake.

It was also evaluated the MeHg risks \n\nassociated with cephalopods consumption in Portugal. The results show that the studied \n\nspecies can give a relevant contribution to the DRI in an equilibrated diet and their consumption \n\nis considered healthy. However, some molluscs and deep-fish species have to be \n\nparsimoniously consumed due to the levels of toxic elements. It can also be state that MeHg \n\nrisk assessment for Portuguese consumers reveals no danger concerning the observed squid \n\nconsumption levels but octopus and cuttlefish consumption present a relatively high MeHg risk. \n\nNevertheless, known the various assumptions used in this study, it can not be considered a \n\npublic health problem. \n\nThese results can be used to complete databases and to establish and revise limits to be \n\nincluded in standards or legislation. However, this is a job that requires constant updating due, \n\nnot only to the variety of species that already exist, but also to the introduction of new species in \n\nthe market, either wild or farmed. Thus, it would be desirable to study the small pelagic fish (eg \n\nchub mackerel and horse mackerel) and other deep-water fish species given the relatively high \n\nvolume of catches in Portugal, and the high number of new imported species that start to be \n\nvery important in the Portuguese market, mainly due to the low price (eg Nile perch - Lates \n\nniloticus or panga - Pangasius hypophthalmus). \n\nThe risk analysis performed in this work is preliminary and need further support. For this, it will \n\nbe necessary to gather consumption data, through surveys of consumption of selected fishery \n\nproducts. Relatively to contaminants, speciation analysis for As compounds is required to \n\ndetermine the toxic and non-toxic fractions in seafood since the toxicity of As is highly \n\ndependent on its chemical form, with inorganic As being the most toxic (Lin et al., 2008). It will \n\nalso be crucial to quantify other chemical contaminants as organic polychlorinated \n\ndibenzodioxins (PCDD), dibenzofurans (PCDF) and PCBs in the fishery and aquaculture \n\nproducts in Portugal because such compounds persist and bioaccumulate through the food \n\nchain (Karouna-Renier et al., 2007). Moreover, although there are some models to assess the \n\nrisk / benefit, eg QALIBRA Tool (QALIBRA, 2010), it would be interesting to look for new \n\nmodels. \n\nAnother area of future research will be the assessment of contaminant compounds \n\nbioaccessibility from seafood to human consumers. In current human health risk assessment, \n\nthe maximum acceptable concentrations of contaminants in food are mostly based on the total \n\nconcentrations. However, the total concentration of contaminants may not always reflect the \n\navailable amount (He et al., 2010). Bioaccessibility determination is thus required to improve the \n\nrisk assessment of contaminants. These studies should be made not only in raw fishery \n\nproducts but also in cooked ones, since it is the latter form that they are consumed by humans. \n\n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\n \n\n65 \n\n8 REFERENCES \n\nAckley, K.

Louren\u00e7o)\nEssential and contaminant elements concentrations were determined in the muscle tissue of octopus\n(Octopus vulgaris), squid (Loligo vulgaris) and cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), caught off the Portuguese coast\nin 2004\u20132005. As expected, the largest concentrations found correspond to Cl, S, K, Na, P and Mg (average\nvalues between 629 mg (100 g)?1, for Cl, and 435 mg kg?1, for Mg, in octopus and squid, respectively).\nAbove average concentrations of Zn, Cu, Fe and Sr were also found. The highest total Hg concentration\nwas found in cuttlefish (0.36 mg kg?1); however, this value did not exceed the recommended limit pro-\nposed by EU (0.5 mg kg?1). Lead levels observed in all samples were always significantly lower than the\nEU limit (1.0 mg kg?1). Regarding Cd, the 1.0 mg kg?1 limit was only exceeded in two octopus samples. It\nmay be concluded that the cephalopods studied do not constitute cause for concern, in terms of toxic ele-\nments, and could be safely used for daily intake of essential elements. Nevertheless, the squid contribu-\ntion for elemental DI is minor in comparison to the other two species.\n\n? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nFish and shellfish are considered some of the most interesting\ndietary products, and their nutritional benefits are well-known.\nSeafood is rich in protein, with a balanced amino acid composition\nand a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (Belitz,\nGrosch, &amp; Schieberle, 2004; Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997). These species\nalso contain most of the 90 natural elements (Causeret, 1962; Lall,\n1995). The largest concentrations correspond to carbon, hydrogen,\nnitrogen, oxygen and sulphur (structural elements) followed by\nchlorine, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, magnesium and calcium\n(Lall, 1995; Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997). Other elements are present at\nlower levels, being described as trace or ultratrace elements. These\nelements are classed as essential, when their biological roles are\nwell-known, such as occurs with iron, copper, zinc, iodine, manga-\nnese, selenium or fluorine; non-essential, when their physiological\nfunctions have not been clearly demonstrated, such as occurs with\nnickel, vanadium and arsenic; and toxic, such as mercury, lead and\ncadmium (Lall, 1995).\n\nCephalopods are an excellent source of some essential elements\n(Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997); however, given the morphological and\nbiological characteristics associated to their habitat, some contam-\nll rights reserved.\n\nnal dos Recursos Biol\u00f3gicos,\ntugal.

In Portugal, cephalopods represented, in 2005,\nonly approximately 8% of wholesale market sales; however, the\ncorresponding values in terms of auction transaction were approx-\nimately three times higher than those registered for fish species\n(Fonseca, Campos, &amp; Garcia, 2002).\n\nAlthough, numerous studies on the elemental composition of\ncephalopod species exist (Napole\u00e3o, Pinheiro, &amp; Sousa Reis, 2005;\nRaimundo, Caetano, &amp; Vale, 2004; Seixas, Bustamante, &amp; Pierce,\n2005a, 2005b; Villanueva &amp; Bustamante, 2006), their objectives\nwere mostly related to environmental contamination and its use\nin biological monitoring. Most of these studies focus on amounts\npresent in several organs such as digestive glands, branchial hearts\nand gills (Bustamante, Lahaye, Durnez, Churlaud, &amp; Caurant, 2006;\nMiramand &amp; Bentley, 1992; Miramand, Bustamante, Bentley, &amp;\nKou\u00e9ta, 2006).\n\nThe primary aim of this work was to quantify the levels of a\nhigh number of essential and toxic elements in the muscle tissue\nof three cephalopods species much enjoyed by Portuguese con-\nsumers, using various analytical techniques. From a public health\nperspective, this study can provide consumers with better knowl-\nedge of nutritional characteristics and contamination problems\nassociated to these species.

Sample collection and preparation\n\nOctopus (Octopus vulgaris), squid (Loligo vulgaris) and cuttlefish\n(Sepia officinalis), were purchased at the Peniche auction, in central\nPortugal (Atlantic North-eastern European coast), from May to\nSeptember in 2004\u20132005. Collected specimens were immediately\nstored in plastic bags, which were placed in ice and taken to the\nlaboratory. Upon arrival, mantle length, total weight, sex and\nmaturity stages were recorded (Table 1). Edible parts (mantle\nand arms) were removed and homogenised in a food blender.\nHomogenised samples were vacuum-sealed in individual plastic\nbags, coded for easy identification, and stored at ?21 ?C until re-\nquired for analysis. Specimen age was estimated by growth models\n(Bettencourt, 2000; Moreno, Azevedo, Pereira, &amp; Pierce, 2007;\nRaya, 2001); the corresponding results are presented in Table 1.\n\n2.2. Analytical methods\n\nDetermination of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Cd and Pb\nlevels was performed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry,\naccording to the procedures described by Jorhem (2000). All anal-\nyses were carried out at least in duplicate; an external calibration\nmethod was used for quantitative analysis. Edible portion sam-\nples (5\u201310 g wet weight) were dry-ashed at 500 ?C under a grad-\nual temperature increase. Ash was dissolved in concentrated\nnitric acid and the solution obtained was evaporated to dryness.\nThe final residue was redissolved with 12 or 5 ml nitric acid\n15% (v/v) and transferred to 25 or 10 ml volumetric flasks\n(10 ml for Pb, Cd and Ni, 25 ml for other elements); final volumes\nwere adjusted with ultrapure water. Quantification of these ele-\nments was performed using a Spectr AA-20 spectrophotometer\nwith deuterium background correction (Varian). Detection limits\n(DL, mg kg?1, wet weight) were 0.01 (K), 0.09 (Na), 0.02 (Mg),\n0.08 (Ca), 0.06 (Zn), 0.32 (Fe), 0.02 (Cu), 0.01 (Mn), 0.02 (Ni),\n0.01 (Cd) and 0.02 (Pb).\n\nTotal Hg was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption\nspectrometry (CVAAS) according to the procedure developed by\nHatch and Ott (1968) and described by Joiris, Holsbeek, Bouqueg-\nneau, and Bossicart (1991). For each specimen, 1 g of homogenised\nedible portion sample was digested with concentrated sulphuric\nacid. Sample mercury (Hg0 and Hg2\u00fe2 ) was subsequently oxidised\nto Hg2+, using potassium permanganate. Following Hg2+ reduction\nto Hg0 with stannous chloride, volatile Hg0 was bubbled into the\nBacharach Coleman MAS-50D Mercury Analyser closed system\n(k = 253.7 nm). Samples were analysed twice. Concentrations were\ncalculated by interpolation using a linear calibration curve ob-\ntained by measuring the absorbance of standard solutions. The\ndetection limit was 0.01 mg kg?1, wet weight.\n\nPhosphorus was determined spectrophotometrically according\nto ISO Standard 13730 (1996). Samples (5 g wet weight) were\ndry-ashed at 500 ?C, followed by acid digestion and colorimetric\nmeasurement of a yellow compound resulting from the reaction\nbetween phosphorus and an ammonium vanadate and ammonium\nTable 1\nCharacteristics of studied cephalopods\n\nCommon name (specie) N Mantle length range (mm) Weight (g)\n\nCommon octopus (O. vulgaris) 10 115\u2013245 427\u20134900\nSquid (L. vulgaris) 10 130\u2013420 65\u20131244\nCommon cuttlefish (S. officinalis) 12 165\u2013315 538\u20133100\nmolybdate mixture, at 430 nm. The detection limit was\n0.01 mg kg?1, wet weight.\n\nIn order to analyse Cl, S, Br, Sr, Rb and Se, homogenised samples\nwere freeze-dried for 48 h, at ?45 ?C and low pressure (approxi-\nmately 10?1 atm). Samples were powdered and immediately vac-\nuum-sealed, in individual coded plastic bags, which were\nsubsequently stored at ?21 ?C, until further analysis. Concentra-\ntions of these six elements were determined using an EDXRF spec-\ntrometer, according to Carvalho, Santiago, and Nunes (2005).\nPowdered samples were pressed into 2.0 cm diameter pellets. Pel-\nlets were glued onto Mylar film, on a sample holder, and directly\nplaced in the path of an X-ray beam, for quantification. Two pellets\nwere prepared for each tissue sample. The detection limits\n(mg kg?1, dry weight) for these elements were 10 (Cl), 10 (S), 0.8\n(Br), 0.5 (Sr), 1.1 (Rb) and 0.6 (Se).\n\nBlanks were always tested in the same conditions as the sam-\nples. All laboratory ware was cleaned with HNO3 (10%) or HCl\n(20%) for 24\u201348 h and rinsed with ultrapure water (18.2 MX cm),\nto avoid contamination. Chemical reagents were pro analysis or\nsuperior. Commercial standard solutions (Merck, 1000 mg l?1)\nwere used for some elements.\n\nAnalytical data for elements are reported in mg (100 g)?1 or\nmg kg?1, depending on element, on a wet weight basis. Mean\nmoisture content in each species was 78% in cuttlefish and squid\nand 83% in octopus. These values were used for the conversion of\nresults to dry weight basis for comparison with other studies.\n\nFive certified reference materials were tested in the same con-\nditions as the samples, in order to assess analytical method accu-\nracy: LUTS-1 (non defatted lobster hepatopancreas), TORT-2\n(Lobster hepatopancreas), DORM-2 (Dogfish muscle) from National\nResearch Council of Canada, SMRD-2000 (Canned matrix meat)\nfrom Swedish Meats R&amp;D and Scan Foods/National Food Adminis-\ntration, Sweden and MA-A-2 (Fish flesh) from International Atomic\nEnergy Agency. Results obtained in this study were in good agree-\nment with certified values (Table 2).\n\n2.3. Statistical analysis\n\nAll data were analysed using the STATISTICA 6.1 software (Stat\nsoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK74104, USA). Pearson\u2019s correlation between\nelements was performed. The Student t-test was used to evaluate\nthe influence of sex on the concentration of various elements, for\neach species. Single factor ANOVA analysis was used to confirm\nthe existence of significant differences between age groups, with-\nin the same species. Due to the absence of normality and variance\nhomogeneity (Lilliefors-test and Levene-test, respectively), the\nKruskal\u2013Wallis non-parametric test was used to evaluate differ-\nences in element concentrations between studied cephalopods\n(Zar, 1999). Differences were considered statistically significant\nwhen p &lt;0.05.\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\n3.1.

Louren\u00e7o et al. / Food Chemistry 113 (2009) 1146\u20131153\npare electrolyte, structural and nutrient element concentrations in\nthe three cephalopod species. Total concentrations of Hg, Pb and\nCd, metals considered toxic and regulated by the EU Commission\n(2006), are summarised in Table 4. Elements with related physio-\nlogical roles were grouped together. Similar patterns were ob-\nserved for all elements for the three cephalopod species; in\ngeneral terms, the highest concentrations were found in octopus\nand the lowest in squid. The main elements were S, Cl, K, Na, P,\nMg and Ca, followed by Br, Zn, Fe, Cu, Sr, Rb, Mn and Ni.\n\n3.2. Electrolytes\n\nThe most abundant elements were the electrolytes K, Cl and Na,\nas illustrated in Fig. 1. Potassium contributes to the intracellular\nion balance, as a monovalent cation; the two other elements con-\nstitute the main extracellular anions and cations, respectively,\nassuming an important role in acid\u2013base balance (Lall, 1995).\nThe chloride concentration was approximately 630 mg (100 g)?1\n\nin octopus; this value was significantly lower in squid (p = 0.000),\nof approximately 270 mg (100 g)?1. Chloride data in seafood is\nscarce. In a study of fish species performed by Oehlenschl\u00e4ger\n(1997), lower values than those found in the present work were\ndescribed. Nevertheless, in fish from Indian coastal areas, Cl con-\ncentrations are the highest, probably due to pollutant organochlo-\nrine compounds (Garg &amp; Ramakrishna, 2006). Average Na levels\ndisplayed an identical pattern to Cl. As usually stated for fish, Na\nconcentration in these cephalopod species is also equal to the mo-\nlar amount of Cl. In general, Na contents are considerably higher in\nshellfish than in finfish (Vlieg, Lee, &amp; Grace, 1991). The highest con-\ncentration of this element was found in octopus (572 mg\n(100 g)?1), followed by cuttlefish (266 mg (100 g)?1) and squid\n(157 mg (100 g)?1). Similar contents were found in other studies\ninvolving molluscs (Lall, 1995; Segar, Collins, &amp; Riley, 1971;\nVillanueva &amp; Bustamante, 2006; Vlieg et al., 1991). Octopus was\nthe cephalopod species showing the lowest K concentration, as op-\nposed to other electrolytes (Fig. 1). Average K concentrations were\nbetween 223 mg (100 g)?1, in octopus, and 289 mg (100 g)?1, in\ncuttlefish. The average K concentration in octopus was significantly\nlower than in cuttlefish (p = 0.01); values for squid were not signif-\nicantly different from the average values observed for the other\ntwo species. The range found in this study agrees with those ob-\ntained by several authors for cephalopods (Carvalho et al., 2005;\nKarakoltsidis, Zotos, &amp; Constantinides, 1995; Lall, 1995; Villanueva\n&amp; Bustamante, 2006).\n\n3.3. Structural elements\n\nPhosphorus and sulphur were the main structural elements\nfound in seafood; in general terms, equal amounts of these two ele-\nments were found in marine species (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997). In this\nstudy, concentrations ranged between 107 and 285 mg (100 g)?1\n\nand 197 and 444 mg (100 g)?1, respectively (Table 3). Squid\nshowed the highest average value for P (260 mg (100 g)?1), clearly\nabove the average 200 mg (100 g)?1 value found in the majority of\nseafood. Significant minimum P concentrations were observed in\noctopus samples, when compared to squid (p = 0.000) and cuttle-\nfish (p = 0.001). Identical amounts were described by Lall (1995),\nin octopus, and wild juvenile cephalopods (Villanueva &amp;\nBustamante, 2006). Other authors reported similar concentrations\nfor bivalve and fish species (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997; Segar et al.,\n1971; Teeny, Gauglitz, Hall, &amp; Houle, 1984). Significantly larger\nconcentrations of S were found in cuttlefish, when compared to\nsquid (p = 0.001) and octopus (p = 0.029); the average value was\n338 mg (100 g)?1.

Nutrient elements\n\nRegarding macro elements, the lowest levels observed corre-\nsponded to Mg and Ca. Fishery products are considered poor\nsources of Mg and Ca (Lall, 1995). Nevertheless, Mg concentrations\nare always higher than Ca concentrations (Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997).\nThis fact was also observed this study (Fig. 1). The magnesium:cal-\ncium ratio (mg/mg) in cephalopods was approximately 3 or 4. The\naverage Mg concentration observed in octopus (938 mg kg?1) was\nsignificantly higher than in the other two cephalopod species\n(p &lt;0.05), ranging between 651 and 1473 mg kg?1. Squid samples\nshowed the lowest levels, ranging between 283 and 610 mg kg?1\n\n(Table 3).

These levels are within the ranges ob-\nserved by other researchers for some cephalopods, bivalve and gas-\ntropoda species (Carvalho et al., 2005; Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997; Segar\net al., 1971; Vlieg et al., 1991), although lower concentrations were\nobserved in wild juvenile cephalopods in a study performed by\nVillanueva and Bustamante (2006). A previous study (Karakoltsidis\net al., 1995) also reported some differences, namely in squid.\n\nIron, Cu, Zn and Mn are important elements for health. These\nelements play the role of functional elements in various metalloen-\nzymes, which have particular catalytic function in living organisms.\nAs frequently observed, concentrations of these elements in cepha-\nlopods are high, when compared to other seafood species\n(Bustamante et al., 2000; Causeret, 1962; Lall, 1995; Raimundo\nstudied cephalopods (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, median and range)\n\n= 10) Common cuttlefish (N = 12)\n\n(median) Range Mean \u00b1 sd (median) Range\n\n3b (0.04) 0.01\u20130.10 0.31 \u00b1 0.28a (0.23) 0.03\u20131.0\n3b (0.09) 0.07\u20130.14 0.04 \u00b1 0.01a (0.04) 0.03\u20130.05\n2b (0.05) 0.02\u20130.08 0.15 \u00b1 0.10a (0.11) 0.08\u20130.37\n\nences within species (p > 0.05).\n\n\n\n1150 H.M. Louren\u00e7o et al. / Food Chemistry 113 (2009) 1146\u20131153\net al., 2004). Of these four elements, zinc concentrations were the\nmost relevant, corroborating the hypothesis that zinc is always\npresent in seafood, but concentrations found in molluscs are gener-\nally higher (Celik &amp; Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2004; Lall, 1995). In the present\nstudy, average levels reached 17.7 mg kg?1, in octopus and cuttle-\nfish samples (Fig. 2 and Table 3), while squid showed the lowest sig-\nnificant average value, of 12.6 mg kg?1 (p = 0.000). Similar values\nhad also been found in previous studies (Miramand &amp; Bentley,\n1992; Napole\u00e3o et al., 2005; Seixas et al., 2005b; Soldevilla, 1987;\nVlieg et al., 1991). The highest average Cu concentrations, approxi-\nmately 4.0 mg kg?1, were found in octopus and cuttlefish samples\n(no significant differences were observed), with some samples\nreaching 10 mg kg?1. The maximum value found for squid samples\nwas 1.8 mg kg?1 (Table 3). Soldevilla (1987), Seixas et al. (2005b)\nand Napole\u00e3o et al. (2005) found identical amounts for the same\noctopus species. Nevertheless, some results found in literature for\nsimilar species do not agree with the former (Carvalho et al.,\n2005; Miramand &amp; Bentley, 1992; Miramand et al., 2006; Segar\net al., 1971; Villanueva &amp; Bustamante, 2006). In a different study,\nhigh concentrations were found in squid; however the species is\nnot specified (Lall, 1995). Iron values found in octopus and squid\nsamples were identical to Cu values (Fig. 2). The highest significant\naverage Fe concentration, approximately 4.0 mg kg?1, was found in\noctopus (p = 0.00); the concentration of this element was only\napproximately 1.5 mg kg?1 in squid and cuttlefish. Some authors\nobserved higher levels (Karakoltsidis et al., 1995; Lall, 1995;\nMiramand et al., 2006; Seixas et al., 2005b; Villanueva &amp;\nBustamante, 2006) in identical species caught in other areas; how-\never, similar concentrations were found in octopus specimens from\nthe Portuguese coast (Napole\u00e3o et al., 2005), the Saharan Fishing\nBank (Soldevilla, 1987) and the French Atlantic coast (Miramand\n&amp; Bentley, 1992). Vlieg et al. (1991) also reported higher values than\nthose observed in this study for arrow squid (Nototodarus sp.) and\nbroad squid (Sepiotheutis bilineata). These different Fe concentra-\ntions may be explained by the different maturity stages of the spec-\nimens in question, sampling period and different habitats (Carvalho\net al., 2005). Published data indicate that Mn amounts are generally\nlow and identical in most seafood species (Astorga Espa\u00f1a, Rodr\u00ed-\nguez Rodr\u00edguez, &amp; D\u00edaz Romero, 2007; Bustamante et al., 2000;\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997), although higher concentrations are found\nin some lamellibranchia and gastropoda (Segar et al., 1971).\nManganese concentrations in this study were low, ranging between\n0.06 and 0.44 mg kg?1, in cuttlefish and octopus, respectively. The\nMn profile was similar to that displayed for Fe (Fig. 2). The highest\naverage concentration was found in octopus (0.31 mg kg?1), fol-\nlowed by squid (0.16 mg kg?1) and cuttlefish (0.11 mg kg?1) (Table\n3). These values correspond to the usual concentrations found in\ncephalopods (Miramand &amp; Bentley, 1992; Napole\u00e3o et al., 2005;\nSeixas et al., 2005b; Soldevilla, 1987). Levels were higher in cuttle-\nfish juveniles, reaching approximately 1.4 mg kg?1 (Villanueva &amp;\nBustamante, 2006). Significant differences in average Fe, Cu, Zn\nand Mn concentrations were always found between squid and octo-\npus (p = 0.003, p = 0.002, p = 0.000 and p = 0.01, respectively).\n\nThe concentrations of the last four elements found in this study\nsuggest that cephalopods may contribute significantly to the daily\nintake (DI) needs, especially in what concerns Cu and Zn.\n\nLittle is known about the function of Sr and Rb in organisms.\nMoreover, the number of studies on the concentrations of these\ntwo elements in fishery products is small; nevertheless, Varo\n(1992) found that Sr levels in seafood could be 20 times higher\nthan in meat. The results of this study indicate that cephalopods\nmay constitute a good source of Sr. Concentrations found were be-\ntween 1.6 mg kg?1 (squid) and 4.7 mg kg?1 (octopus), The Sr pro-\nfile was identical to that observed for some elements (Figs. 1 and\n2); the average concentration in octopus (3.8 mg kg?1) was signif-\nicantly higher than those found in cuttlefish (2.3 mg kg?1) and\nsquid (1.8 mg kg?1). Vlieg et al. (1991) found identical concentra-\ntions in squid species. Lamellibranchia and gastropoda species\n(Segar et al., 1971) also showed similar levels. Concentrations mea-\nsured by Villanueva and Bustamante (2006) in the same species\nwere higher, particularly in cuttlefish, possibly because this study\nfocused on juveniles. Lowest concentrations were observed in\nstudies performed in fish species (Garg &amp; Ramakrishna, 2006;\nTeeny et al., 1984). Rubidium concentrations ranged between\n0.22 and 0.95 mg kg?1, respectively, in octopus and squid. These\nconcentrations were lower than Sr concentrations and agree with\nthe existing literature (Carvalho et al., 2005; Villanueva &amp;\nBustamante, 2006). In a study of fish species from different regions\nof India, performed by Garg and Ramakrishna (2006), a large dis-\npersion of Rb concentrations was observed. No significant differ-\nences were found between squid and cuttlefish, for both\nelements. A similar concentration pattern was observed for Rb\nand K in the three species (octopus &lt;squid &lt;cuttlefish), which\ncan be explained by the electrochemical affinity of these elements.\n\nThe last essential trace element analysed was Ni. A few years\nago, the physiological functions of this element were not clear (Lall,\n1995). Nowadays it is thought that Ni plays a role in hormone, lipid\nand cell membrane metabolism, as well as activating enzymes\nassociated with the glucose breakdown and use ( Acu-Cell, 2007).\nThe nickel concentration profile was different from profiles ob-\nserved for other microelements (Fig. 2). The average levels ob-\nserved in octopus and squid, of 0.02 mg kg?1 (no significant\ndifferences were found), were lower than the average level ob-\nserved in cuttlefish, of 0.05 mg kg?1. These concentrations are con-\nsidered low, possibly because the specimens collected originate\nfrom an unpolluted ocean area. These results agree with those pub-\nlished by other authors (Carvalho et al., 2005; Miramand &amp; Bentley,\n1992; Varo, 1992). Nevertheless, Napole\u00e3o et al. (2005) and\nVillanueva and Bustamante (2006) observed higher concentrations\nof Ni in the same octopus species.\n\n3.5. Non-metals\n\nSelenium and bromine are non-metals, classed as essential or\ntoxic, depending on their concentration (Lall, 1995). Bromine data\nin seafood is relatively scarce; however, this element is known to\nhave anti-seizure properties, as potassium bromide or sodium bro-\nmide, appearing to be effective trace elements regarding the pre-\nvention of hyperthyroid conditions (Acu-Cell, 2007). In this\nstudy, Br concentrations found in octopus ranged between 26.8\nand 40.2 mg kg?1, whereas average Br values found in squid and\ncuttlefish samples were lower than those found in octopus (13.3\nand 21.5 mg kg?1, respectively). Significant differences were ob-\nserved between the three species (p = 0.000 for squid/octopus\nand p = 0.03 for squid/cuttlefish and octopus/cuttlefish). Garg and\nRamakrishna (2006) found similar average Br concentrations, be-\ntween 43 and 93 mg kg?1 (dry weight basis), in fish from different\nregions of India, having considered this element as a pollutant.\n\nSelenium in low concentrations, in addition to its role as an\nessential micronutrient for normal growth and reproduction, has\na protective effect against toxic elements in organisms (Barghigiani,\nPellegrini, D?Ulivo, &amp; De Ranieri, 1991; Feroci, Badiello, &amp; Fini,\n2005). Although Se was found in all samples analysed, the concen-\ntrations observed ranged between the detection limit (DL) and the\nquantification limit (QL). Concentrations found in squid and cuttle-\nfish samples were close to the QL (1.0 mg kg?1, dry weight;\napproximately 0.2 mg kg?1, wet weight) whereas concentrations\nfound in octopus were closed to the DL (0.6 mg kg?1, dry weight;\napproximately 0.1 mg kg?1, wet weight). Similar values were\nfound in studies performed in molluscs (Astorga Espa\u00f1a et al.,\n2007; Napole\u00e3o et al., 2005; Plessi, Bertelli, &amp; Monzani, 2001;\nSeixas et al., 2005b). Seafood species usually showed values\n\n\n\nTable 5\nDaily intake and contribution of each element in octopus, squid and cuttlefish\n\nElements Daily intake (DI)a (mg) Percent of DI in a 100 g portion of\ncephalopods (octopus\u2013squid\u2013cuttlefish)\n\nCa 1000 2\u20131\u20131\nCl 3500 18\u20138\u201312\nCu 1\u20131.5 30\u201312\u201336\nFe 15 3\u20131\u20131\nK 2000\u20135900 6\u20137\u20137\nMg 300\u2013400 27\u201312\u201316\nMn 2\u20135 1\u20130.5\u20130.3\nNa&lt;2300 25\u20137\u201312\nNi 0.025\u20130.030 7\u20137\u201318\nP 800\u20131200 15\u201326\u201325\nS 800\u20131000 28\u201325\u201338\nSrb 1\u20135 15\u20137\u20139\nZn 10\u201315 14\u201310\u201314\n\na Belitz et al.

Toxic elements\n\nNon-essential functions are known for Hg, Cd and Pb, which are\nconsidered harmful (Ruiter, 1995). Concentrations in marine organ-\nisms reflect environmental pollution (Belitz et al., 2004; Carvalho\net al., 2005; Ruiter, 1995); bioaccumulation and biomagnification\nare observed in some organisms. Lead is considered a chronic or\naccumulative poison (Seixas et al., 2005b). In the species studied,\nPb concentrations were the lowest, among toxic elements. The pro-\nfile observed for this element is different from the profiles observed\nfor the remaining two. Of all samples analysed, squid reached the\nhighest concentration, 0.14 mg kg?1, representing almost one tenth\nof the limit proposed by the EU for cephalopods (1.0 mg kg?1),\nwhereas average concentrations were low in cuttlefish and octopus\nsamples, of 0.04 and 0.02 mg kg?1, respectively. These values agree\nwith the results published by some authors (Mart\u00ed-Cid, Bocio,\nLlobet, &amp; Domingo, 2007; Miramand &amp; Bentley, 1992) despite being\nlower than results published by others (Raimundo et al., 2004;\nSeixas et al., 2005; Villanueva &amp; Bustamante, 2006).\n\nMercury is one of the most toxic elements, with seafood repre-\nsenting one of its major sources in the human food chain (Plessi\net al., 2001). Total Hg levels detected in cephalopods were always\nlower than the limit set by the EU (0.5 mg kg?1), in all samples\nstudied. Average Hg concentrations were similar in octopus and\ncuttlefish, of approximately 0.14 mg kg?1; however, maximum\nconcentrations were found in cuttlefish (0.37 mg kg?1) whereas\nthe lowest levels, of approximately 0.02 mg kg?1, were found in\nsquid. These values agree with results reported by other authors,\nfor the same species (Bustamante et al., 2006; Pierce, Stowasser,\nHastie, &amp; Bustamante, 2007; Villanueva &amp; Bustamante, 2006). In\ngeneral terms, it may be said that total Hg concentrations in ceph-\nalopods are low (Plessi et al., 2001; Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas\net al., 2005a, 2005b; Villanueva &amp; Bustamante, 2006) and do not\nrepresent a risk for human consumption.\n\nMolluscs very often accumulate cadmium in digestive glands\n(Bustamante et al., 1998); however, minor amounts are also found\nin the mantle and arms (Miramand &amp; Bentley, 1992). In most\norganisms, this element may compete with Fe, Cu and Zn, which\nturns its presence into a serious hazard (Carvalho et al., 2005).\nRegarding the cephalopods studied, modest average amounts were\nfound in squid (0.04 mg kg?1), when compared to octopus and cut-\ntlefish, in which average concentrations of 0.38 and 0.31 mg kg?1\n\nwere found, respectively (Table 4). In squid, data obtained agrees\nwith data obtained by other authors (Mart\u00ed-Cid et al., 2007; Pierce\net al., 2007; Villanueva &amp; Bustamante, 2006). The limit proposed by\nthe EU for cadmium (1.0 mg kg?1) was reached in one cuttlefish\nsample and exceeded in two octopus samples, despite this fact\nthe average levels did not exceed the indicative value. Bustamante\net al. (1998), Raimundo et al. (2004) and Miramand et al. (2006)\nfound identical concentrations for similar species. Nevertheless,\nlower concentrations were reported in cuttlefish, in different stud-\nies (Mart\u00ed-Cid et al., 2007; Miramand &amp; Bentley, 1992; Villanueva &amp;\nBustamante, 2006). In octopus, some authors also observed higher\nlevels (Seixas et al., 2005b; Soldevilla, 1987), possibly due to the\ndifferent environments.\n\nIn general terms, mean and median concentrations of these\ntoxic elements are identical (Table 4), which indicates that the\ncephalopod population in the study habitat may be well-known.\nStatistical analysis performed for these three toxic metals did not\nreveal significant differences between octopus and cuttlefish. This\nfact shows that squid must have a different behaviour from the\nother two cephalopod species, probably due to its size and diet.\n3.7. Influence of age, sex and relationships between element levels\n\nComparison between age groups was performed for each spe-\ncies. Differences in Hg concentrations were only found in squid.\nNo significant differences were found between age groups in octo-\npus and cuttlefish. Several studies were performed in seafood to\ntest the significance of differences or find correlations between\nage or size and Hg concentrations; however, the results obtained\nwere inconsistent (Pierce et al., 2007; Raimundo et al., 2004; Seixas\net al.,2005a, 2005b). In a similar way to what occurred in the pres-\nent study, Pierce et al. (2007) found that body size was a significant\nfactor in Loligo forbesi, whereas other authors (Raimundo et al.,\n2004; Seixas et al., 2005b) did not find any significant differences\nin octopus. Significant differences in element concentrations with\nsex were only found for Mn and only in squid and cuttlefish\n(p = 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively). Mn concentrations were\nhigher in females of these two species, probably due to reproduc-\ntive requirements.\n\nNumerous positive and negative correlations were observed\namong elements for all cephalopod species (data not show). Some\nof the most significant (p &lt;0.005 and absolute correlation coeffi-\ncient r P 0.8000) positive correlations found were between K/\nMg/Zn, Mn/Fe, Zn/Cu, Fe/Cd, and Cu/Cd. In octopus some negative\ncorrelations were also found, such as Sr/K and Sr/P. Seixas et al.\n(2005b) found similar relationships with Cd. These correlations\nmay be explained by the Cd interaction with the metabolism of\nthese essential metals (Peraza, Ayala-Fierro, Barber, Casarez, &amp;\nRael, 1998).\n\n3.8. Daily and provisional tolerable weekly element intakes\n\nSeveral suggestions have been made regarding daily intake\n(DI) values relative to elements (Belitz et al., 2004; Lall, 1995;\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger, 1997). The values proposed by Belitz et al. (2004)\nand Acu-cell (2007) are listed in Table 5. Considering the concentra-\ntions found in the present work, DI percentages for each element\nare also shown in Table 5. Analysis of the results included in this ta-\nble shows that cephalopods may contribute significantly to the DI\nof S, P, Mg, Zn and Cu, representing 10\u201338% of the DI. Daily intakes\nof Ni and Sr are also important. Additionally, Ca, Fe and Mn percent-\nages are small, ranging between 0.3% and 3%. The Na percentage\n(based on minimum intake for good health) is higher than the K\npercentage, especially for octopus, which indicates a high Na/K ra-\ntio. This fact is important, since some studies suggest an increased\nrisk of developing high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease\n(Astorga Espa\u00f1a et al., 2007). The contribution of octopus and cut-\ntlefish is more relevant than that of squid, in general terms. This dif-\n\n\n\n1152 H.M. Louren\u00e7o et al. / Food Chemistry 113 (2009) 1146\u20131153\nference could be explained by a different diet. According to the Joint\nFood and Agriculture Organisation/World Health Organisation\n(FAO/WHO) (WHO, 1999, 2003) provisional tolerable weekly in-\ntakes (PTWI) for Hg, Cd and Pb are 5 lg kg?1 body weight, 7 lg kg?1\n\nbody weight and 25 lg kg?1 body weight, respectively. With basis\non a weekly average consumption of fishery products in Portugal\nof 1120 g (160 g/day) (FAO, 2007), an average human body weight\nof 60 kg and the average Hg, Cd and Pb values found in this study\n(Table 4), estimated weekly intakes of Hg and Pb are much lower\nthan established PTWIs, for all three species. Nevertheless, the\nPTWI of 7 lg kg?1 body weight for cadmium is almost reached or\nslightly exceeded when cuttlefish (6.7 lg kg?1 body weight) and\noctopus (9.7 lg kg?1 body weight) are consumed. However, it\nwould be very unlikely for a person to consume the aforementioned\namounts of these species per week; therefore, the values obtained\nare overestimated.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe elemental profile is quite similar for the three species stud-\nied, the major elements being Cl, Na, K, S, P, Mg and Ca, followed by\nBr, Zn, Fe, Cu, Sr, Rb, Se, Mn and Ni. This indicates that these ele-\nments may have the same physiological importance in the three\ncephalopod species. Results obtained in this study also suggest that\ncephalopods may constitute a good source of some essential ele-\nments, such as P, Mg, Zn and Cu. In general, comparison of element\nconcentrations in octopus, squid and cuttlefish shows that the low-\nest concentrations of most elements are found in squid; therefore,\nits contribution for DIs is lower than that of the other two species.\nRegarding Hg and Pb intakes, consumption does not guide to any\nconcerns, although it should be moderate when considering Cd in-\ntake, especially regarding octopus.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank PNAB/EU Data Collection Reg-\nulation, particularly Dr. Jo\u00e3o Pereira, for providing cephalopod\nspecimens.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the proximate composition as well as essential and non-essential elements\nin the edible muscle of Nephrops norvegicus (Norway lobster).\n\nRESULTS: The studied crustacean showed a high protein level of about 210 g kg?1 and a mineral level of about 24 g kg?1 . The\npattern for the elements studied was Cl > Na > K > P > S > Ca > Mg > Br > Fe > Sr ? Zn > Cu > Mn > Rb > Se > Ni > Cr.\nRegarding non-essential elements, the average total Hg content was 0.40 mg kg?1 , but two samples exceeded the legal limit\nset by the European Union (EU) for Hg in crustaceans (0.50 mg kg?1 ). The levels of Pb and Cd found in all samples were below\nthe EU limits (0.50 mg kg?1 for both metals).\n\nCONCLUSION: Nephrops norvegicus is a good source of protein and contains most minerals at levels sufficient to satisfy the\ndietary reference intake. The amounts of Pb and Cd are not a concern. Hg levels indicate some contamination; however, taking\ninto account the type of consumption of this species, it can be concluded that this does not represent a risk in terms of the\nhuman diet.\nc\u00a9 2009 Society of Chemical Industry\n\nKeywords: Nephrops norvegicus; essential elements; non-essential elements; FAAS; EDXRF\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe importance of seafood products in a balanced diet is well\nknown. They are protein-rich with a good amino acid composition\nand a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids.1,2 These\nproducts contain most of the 90 elements that appear in nature.3,4\n\nC, H, N, O and S (structural elements) followed by macroelements\nsuch as Cl, K, P, Na, Mg and Ca constitute the largest amounts\nfound.1,4 Other elements such as Fe, Cu, Zn, I, Mn, Se, Ni and\nCr occur in lower concentrations and are considered trace or\nultratrace elements. Depending on their physiological functions,\nelements are classified as either essential when their functions are\nwell confirmed or non-essential when their roles have not been\nwell demonstrated.4 Some elements such as Br and Sn remain to\nbe classified. Hg, Pb and Cd are non-essential elements found in\nmarine fish products. Since 2001 there have been legal limits set\nby the European Union (EU)5,6 on Hg, Pb and Cd levels in several\ntypes of food, including seafood.\n\nAmong seafood products, crustaceans are important not only\nowing to their nutritional properties but also because of their\nhigh market value.7 Shellfish are widely consumed in Southern\nEurope; for example, the annual consumption per capita in\nPortugal reached 11.5 kg in 2006.8 Nephrops norvegicus (Norway\nlobster) production in 2007 was 226.5 t out of 970.9 t of\ntotal crustacean catches.9 In spite of this, the biochemical\ncomposition of some deep-sea crustacean species has not\nbeen studied to the same extent as that of others.10 Several\nstudies have been done in an attempt to determine trace\n\nmetal accumulation in crustaceans instead of studying element\nbenefits.11 \u2013 20\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterise the edible muscle of\nN. norvegicus in terms of proximate and elemental composition\nand therefore to contribute to a better knowledge of nutritional\nbenefits and hazards of this species.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\nSample collection and preparation\nNephrops norvegicus specimens were caught off the southwestern\nPortuguese coast, Algarve (Portima?o, 36? 47.6?

Homogenised\nsamples were vacuum sealed in individual plastic bags, coded for\neasy identification and stored at ?21 ?C until required for analysis.\nSample analysis\nThe proximate composition \u2013 protein (Kjeldahl method), fat (Soxh-\nlet extraction with ethyl ether), moisture (sample dried overnight\nat 105 ?C) and ash (sample incinerated at 500 ?C to constant\nweight) \u2013 was determined according to AOAC methods.21\n\nQuantification of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Cr,\nCd and Pb levels was performed by flame atomic absorption\nspectrometry (FAAS) according to Jorhem.22 The method is based\non sample (10 \u2013 15 g) incineration and dissolution in HNO3 . All\nanalyses were carried out at least in duplicate using a Spectr\nAA-20 spectrometer (Varian Australia, Mulgrave, Australia) with\ndeuterium background correction. Quantification was made by\nthe external calibration method. Detection limits (DLs, mg kg?1\nwet weight) were calculated from the residual standard deviation\n(RSD) of the response and the slope (S) of the calibration curve for\neach element: DL = 3.3 \u00d7 RSD/S. The values obtained were 0.01\n(K), 0.09 (Na), 0.02 (Mg), 0.08 (Ca), 0.06 (Zn), 0.32 (Fe), 0.02 (Cu), 0.01\n(Mn), 0.02 (Ni), 0.09 (Cr), 0.01 (Cd) and 0.02 (Pb) mg kg?1 wet weight.\n\nTotal Hg was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption\naccording to the method developed by Hatch and Ott23 and\ndescribed by Joiris et al.24 using a Coleman MAS-50D mercury anal-\nyser system (Bacharach, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). In this method,\nhomogenised samples (1 g) are first digested with concentrated\nH2 SO4 , then Hg is oxidised to Hg\n\n2+ with 50 g L?1 potassium per-\nmanganate. Subsequently, Hg is reduced to Hg0 with 200 g L?1\nstannous chloride, and the volatile Hg0 is bubbled into the closed\nsystem of the mercury analyser. All samples were analysed in\nduplicate. Concentrations were calculated from linear calibration\nobtained by measurement of the absorbance of standard solutions.\nThe DL (calculated as above) was 0.01 mg kg?1 wet weight.\n\nP was determined spectrophotometrically according to ISO\n13 73025 using a UNICAM UV 5 220 spectrophotometer (ATI UNI-\nCAM, Cambridge, UK) In this method, samples (5 g) are incinerated\nand dissolved in 200 g L?1 HCl. Colorimetric measurements are\nperformed on the yellow compound obtained from the reaction\nof P with a mixture of ammonium vanadate and ammonium\nmolybdate. Quantification was made by the external calibration\nmethod. The DL (calculated as above) was 0.01 mg kg?1 wet\nweight.\n\nAll laboratory ware was cleaned with 100 g L?1 HNO3 or\n200 g L?1 HCl for 24 \u2013 48 h and rinsed with ultrapure water\n(18.2 M? cm). All chemicals were of reagent grade. Commercial\nstandard solutions (1 g L?1) for K, Na, Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni, Cr,\nCd, Pb, Hg and P (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used.\n\nTo analyse Cl, S, Br, Sr, Rb and Se, samples were freeze-dried\n(48 h at ?40 ?C and ?0.1 atm), pulverised, immediately vacuum\nsealed in individual coded plastic bags and stored at ?21 ?C until\nfurther analysis. Determination of these six elements was carried\nout according to Carvalho et al.26 using an energy-dispersive\nX-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometer consisting of a PW 1140\nX-ray tube (100 kV, 80 mA; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands)\nequipped with a changeable Mo secondary target and Si(Li)\ndetector (Oxford, High Wycombe, UK). The energy resolution was\n135 eV at 5.9 keV and the acquisition system was a Nucleus PCA\ncard (Oxford, High Wycombe, UK). Two pellets were prepared for\neach sample. DLs (mg kg?1 dry weight) for these elements were\ndetermined by the signal-to-noise approach, where the equipment\ncompares the signal of each element with blank samples and\nestablishes the minimum concentration at which the element is\nreliably detected. The values obtained were 10 (Cl), 10 (S), 0.8 (Br),\n0.5 (Sr), 1.1 (Rb) and 0.6 (Se) mg kg?1 dry weight.\n\nAnalytical data for elements are reported as g kg?1 or mg kg?1\non a wet weight basis.\n\nFive certified reference materials were tested under the same\nconditions as the samples in order to assess the accuracy of\nthe analytical method: LUTS-1 (National Research Council of\nCanada, Ottawa, Canada) non-defatted lobster hepatopancreas\n(used only in the FAAS technique for essential elements); TORT-2\n(National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Canada) lobster\nhepatopancreas; DORM-2, dogfish muscle (National Research\nCouncil of Canada, Ottawa, Canada); SMRD-2000, canned matrix\nmeat (Swedish Meats R&amp;D and Scan Foods/National Food Adminis-\ntration, Ka?vlinge, Sweden); MA-A-2, fish flesh (International Atomic\nEnergy Agency, Vienne, Austria) (used only in EDXRF technique).\nThe results obtained in this study were in good agreement with\nthe certified values (Table 2).\n\nConsidering the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI,\nexpressed in mg kg?1) of non-essential metals, a portion of seafood\nand a person\u2019s body weight (BW, expressed in kg), one can estimate\nthe maximum number of meals (X ) that can be consumed:\n\nX = (PTWI \u00d7 BW)/(C \u00d7 D)\nwhere C is the mean concentration of metals in seafood (expressed\nin mg kg?1) and D is the portion of seafood (expressed in g) per\nmeal.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data analysis was carried out using Statistica 6.1 (StatSoft,\nInc., Tulsa, OK, USA). Normality and variance homogeneity were\nconfirmed by the Lilliefors test and the Levene test respectively.27\n\nThe Pearson correlation between elements was determined. The\nStudent t test was used to verify the influence of sex on various\nelements. Significant differences were considered at P &lt;0.05.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe proximate chemical composition of N. norvegicus edible\nmuscle showed the normal pattern for crustaceans.2,28,29 Thus\nthe protein content, about 210 g kg?1 (206 \u00b1 7 g kg?1), was similar\nto that found by Rosa and Nunes10 in the same lobster species and\nby Go?ko\u00f0olu and Yerlikaya30 in Portunus pelagicus (swim crab).\n\nJ Sci Food Agric 2009; 89: 2572 \u2013 2580 c\u00a9 2009 Society of Chemical Industry www.interscience.wiley.com/jsfa\n\n\n\n2\n5\n\n7\n4\n\nwww.soci.org HM Lourenc?o et al.\n\nT\na\n\nb\nle\n\n2\n.\n\nR\ne\n\nsu\nlt\n\ns\no\n\nf\nan\n\nal\nys\n\nis\n(n\n\n=\n4\n\n)\nfo\n\nr\nso\n\nm\ne\n\nce\nrt\n\nifi\ne\n\nd\nre\n\nfe\nre\n\nn\nce\n\nm\nat\n\ne\nri\n\nal\ns\n\n(m\ne\n\nan\n\u00b1\n\nst\nan\n\nd\nar\n\nd\nd\n\ne\nvi\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n,m\n\ng\nkg\n\n?1\nd\n\nry\nw\n\ne\nig\n\nh\nt)\n\nM\nat\n\ne\nri\n\nal\nK\n\nN\na\n\nP\nM\n\ng\nC\n\na\nZ\n\nn\nF\n\ne\nC\n\nu\nS\n\nr\nM\n\nn\nS\n\ne\nN\n\ni\nC\n\nr\nH\n\ng\nP\n\nb\nC\n\nd\n\nLU\nT\n\nS\n-\n\nC\ne\n\nrt\nifi\n\ne\nd\n\n9\n4\n\n8\n\u00b1\n\n7\n2\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n8\n9\n.5\n\n\u00b1\n4\n.1\n\n2\n0\n\n3\n\u00b1\n\n3\n3\n\n1\n2\n.4\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.8\n\n1\n1\n.6\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.9\n\n1\n5\n.9\n\n\u00b1\n1\n.2\n\n\u2013\n1\n.2\n\n0\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.1\n\n3\n\u2013\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n0\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.0\n\n3\n4\n\n<\nD\n\nLb\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n1\na\n\nO\nb\n\nta\nin\n\ne\nd\n\n9\n5\n\n5\n\u00b1\n\n2\n3\n\n9\n0\n.8\n\n\u00b1\n2\n.2\n\n1\n9\n\n7\n\u00b1\n\n1\n6\n\n1\n3\n.7\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.7\n\n1\n2\n.1\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.4\n\n1\n5\n.4\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.2\n\n1\n.2\n\n8\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.0\n\n3\n0\n.1\n\n9\n5\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.0\n\n0\n9\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n9\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.0\n\n1\n2\n\nS\nM\n\nR\nD\n\n-\nC\n\ne\nrt\n\nifi\ne\n\nd\n1\n\n8\n5\n\n9\n\u00b1\n\n8\n5\n\n8\n5\n\n3\n3\n\n\u00b1\n2\n\n8\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n7\n5\n\n\u00b1\n4\n\n7\n\u2013\n\n7\n0\n.3\n\n\u00b1\n8\n.3\n\n\u2013\n6\n.3\n\n3\n\u00b1\n\n1\n.6\n\n6\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nO\nb\n\nta\nin\n\ne\nd\n\n1\n9\n\n3\n8\n\n\u00b1\n3\n\n8\n8\n\n3\n4\n\n6\n\u00b1\n\n2\n8\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n8\n\u00b1\n\n1\n1\n\n6\n6\n.1\n\n\u00b1\n7\n.4\n\n4\n.9\n\n4\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.0\n\n9\n\nT\nO\n\nR\nT\n\n-\nC\n\ne\nrt\n\nifi\ne\n\nd\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n1\n8\n\n0\n\u00b1\n\n6\n1\n\n0\n5\n\n\u00b1\n1\n\n3\n1\n\n0\n6\n\n\u00b1\n1\n\n0\n4\n\n5\n.2\n\n\u00b1\n1\n.9\n\n1\n3\n.6\n\n\u00b1\n1\n.2\n\n5\n.6\n\n3\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.6\n\n7\n2\n.5\n\n0\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.1\n\n9\n0\n.7\n\n7\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.1\n\n5\n0\n.2\n\n7\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.0\n\n6\n0\n.3\n\n5\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.1\n\n3\n2\n\n6\n.7\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.6\n\n2\nO\n\nb\nta\n\nin\ne\n\nd\n1\n\n7\n5\n\n\u00b1\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n9\n\u00b1\n\n3\n9\n\n3\n\u00b1\n\n5\n4\n\n3\n.4\n\n\u00b1\n3\n.2\n\n1\n3\n.1\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.1\n\n5\n.3\n\n4\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.4\n\n3\n2\n.3\n\n7\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.0\n\n8\n0\n.6\n\n5\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n0\n.2\n\n8\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.0\n\n0\n0\n.3\n\n5\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.0\n\n6\n2\n\n6\n.8\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.1\n\nD\nO\n\nR\nM\n\n-\nC\n\ne\nrt\n\nifi\ne\n\nd\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n2\n5\n.6\n\n\u00b1\n2\n.3\n\n1\n4\n\n2\n\u00b1\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n.3\n\n4\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.1\n\n6\n\u2013\n\n3\n.6\n\n6\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.3\n\n4\n1\n.4\n\n0\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.0\n\n9\n1\n\n9\n.4\n\n\u00b1\n3\n.1\n\n3\n4\n.7\n\n\u00b1\n5\n.5\n\n4\n.6\n\n4\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.2\n\n6\n0\n.0\n\n6\n5\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.0\n\n0\n7\n\n0\n.0\n\n4\n3\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.0\n\n1\n2\n\n2\nO\n\nb\nta\n\nin\ne\n\nd\n2\n\n3\n.7\n\n\u00b1\n2\n.6\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n\u00b1\n\n4\n2\n.5\n\n0\n\u00b10\n\n.5\n5\n\n3\n.6\n\n2\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.1\n\n8\n1\n.4\n\n0\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.1\n\n0\n1\n\n6\n.4\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.2\n\n3\n0\n.6\n\n\u00b1\n2\n.4\n\n4\n.4\n\n8\n\u00b1\n\n0\n.1\n\n2\n0\n.0\n\n6\n6\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.0\n\n0\n4\n\n0\n.0\n\n4\n0\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.0\n\n0\n3\n\nM\nA\n\n-A\n-\n\nC\ne\n\nrt\nifi\n\ne\nd\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n1\n.7\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.3\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n2\nO\n\nb\nta\n\nin\ne\n\nd\n1\n.5\n\n\u00b1\n0\n.4\n\na\nV\n\nal\nu\n\ne\ns\n\nin\nm\n\ng\nkg\n\n?1\nas\n\nb\no\n\ntt\nle\n\nd\n.\n\nb\nD\n\ne\nte\n\nct\nio\n\nn\nlim\n\nit\n.\n\nwww.interscience.wiley.com/jsfa c\u00a9 2009 Society of Chemical Industry J Sci Food Agric 2009; 89: 2572 \u2013 2580\n\n\n\n2\n5\n\n7\n5\n\nChemical characterisation of Nephrops norvegicus www.soci.org\n\nThe mean mineral content ranged from 23.3 to 26.1 g kg?1, in\nagreement with values recorded in P. pelagicus and Callinectes\nsapidus (blue crab)30,31 but higher than those found in fish.1 The\nfat content was always lower than 10 g kg?1 and the moisture\ncontent ranged between 750 and 800 g kg?1. These values are\nalso in accordance with those published in the literature.10,31,32\n\nTables 3 and 4 present the concentrations (mean, standard\ndeviation (SD) and range) of macroelements and trace elements\nrespectively found in N. norvegicus edible muscle. The profile for\nmineral content was Cl > Na > K > P > S > Ca > Mg > Br >\nFe > Sr ? Zn > Cu > Mn > Rb > Se > Ni > Cr. There were no\nsignificant differences between males and females in the levels of\nany of these elements (P > 0.05).\n\nThe major elements present in N. norvegicus muscle were K, Cl\nand Na. Of these, K contributes to the intracellular ion balance as\na monovalent cation, while Cl and Na are the main extracellular\nanion and cation respectively, assuming an important role in\nthe acid \u2013 base balance.4 The mean levels of K, Cl and Na were\nabout 3.4, 4.7 and 4.4 g kg?1 respectively. The mean content\nfound for Cl is much higher than that reported by Causeret3 and\nOehlenschla?ger1 in fish species (average ?1 g kg?1). A higher\nlevel of K was observed by Karakoltsidis et al.32 in the same\nlobster species (8.0 g kg?1). This discrepancy could be due to the\ndifferent geographical catching areas or even to the season. In\ncontrast, some authors observed lower levels of Na and K in blue\ncrab (3.2 and 3.0 g kg?1 respectively), European lobster (3.2 and\n2.6 g kg?1 respectively) and American lobster (2.0 and 2.6 g kg?1\n\nrespectively).30,33 Nevertheless, the values found for these two\nelements in the present study are comparable to those reported\nin other shellfish species.4,26\n\nP and S were the second most abundant elements in\nN. norvegicus muscle. In living organisms, 80 \u2013 85% of P is present\nin bones, the remainder being found in extracellular fluids,\nintracellular structures and cell membranes.4 P is directly involved\nin energy-producing cellular reactions.4 S is present in amino acids,\npolypeptides, proteins and enzymes. The mean contents of these\ntwo elements were 2.3 and 1.4 g kg?1 respectively. Values of S\ncontent are scarce in the literature; however, a study by Vlieg\net al.34 showed concentrations of S between 1.3 and 2.2 g kg?1 in\nthree species of crustaceans, while Barrento et al.33 reported levels\naround 1.7 g kg?1 in European and American lobsters. Levels of\nP are identical to those indicated by other authors in fish1,35 and\nsome shellfish.34,36,37 Crustaceans such as blue and swim crabs\nshowed a slightly lower content.30,31 The similar results found for\nother crustaceans of different habitat, depth and genus indicate\nthat different crustacean species use and metabolise these two\nelements in an identical manner.\n\nTwo cations that are essential nutrients for life are Ca and Mg.\nCa participates in a number of regulatory functions, while Mg\nis essential for energy-requiring biological functions.4 Seafood\nis considered a poor source of these elements, and fish species\ngenerally contain more Mg than Ca.1 However, N. norvegicus\nmuscle showed higher concentrations of these elements, with\nthe mean content of Ca being greater than that of Mg (1.0 and\n0.6 g kg?1 respectively). It is commonly accepted that crustaceans\nshow this pattern owing to a biomineralisation process. In fact,\ncrustaceans have a particularly active Ca metabolism and have\nthe ability to form cyclically not only an external structure but\nalso Ca storage forms.38 Other authors have also indicated higher\nCa than Mg levels in such species.4,28,33,39 Thus, compared with\nother seafood, N. norvegicus can be a good source of Ca in human\nnutrition.\n\nData on Br in seafood are scarce, but it is known that this\nnon-metallic element in the form of potassium bromide or sodium\nbromide has anti-seizure properties and seems to be an effective\ntrace mineral in regard to hyperthyroid conditions.40 According to\nVaro,36 the average Br concentration in fish is about 2 mg kg?1. In\nthe present study, N. norvegicus showed higher amounts ranging\nfrom 26.8 to 44.3 mg kg?1. Barrento et al.20,33 and Mohapatra\net al.41 also found levels around 20 mg kg?1 or even higher in\nsome crustaceans. These high concentrations of Br in crustaceans\nare probably due to species biology, habitat, food source and\nenvironment.\n\nShellfish usually show high levels of Fe, Zn and Cu and in this\nsense could make a good contribution to the daily requirement\nof these elements, which play an important role in human life.\nAs constituents of metalloenzymes, Fe, Zn and Cu give rise to\nparticular catalytic functions: Fe is essential in the transport,\nstorage and utilisation of oxygen; Zn controls many processes of\ncarbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism and nucleoprotein\nsynthesis; Cu is a cofactor for enzymes involved in glucose\nmetabolism and haemoglobin synthesis. In crustaceans, Cu is\nrequired by the respiratory pigment haemocyanin. Many studies\nhave been performed to determine levels of these three elements,\nsome of them in crustaceans caught in several areas.14,15,32,33,42,43\n\nIn the investigated species, high contents of Fe, Zn and Cu\nwere reported. The mean concentrations of Fe, Zn and Cu\nfound in N. norvegicus in the present study were 20.0, 17.4 and\n10.6 mg kg?1, with the largest quantity being detected for Fe\n(35.4 mg kg?1). A different result was obtained by Capelli et al.44\n\nfor N. norvegicus caught in the Ligurian Sea, where Zn and Cu\ncontents were lower (13 and 6.2 mg kg?1 respectively). However,\nsome studies performed on lobsters, shrimps and crabs indicated\nsimilar concentrations of Fe, Zn and Cu to those detected in the\npresent study.17,19,45,46 Data presented for the three elements in\nN. norvegicus edible muscle are in close agreement for this type of\ncrustacean, which is one of the seafood species that can be a good\nsource for human daily intake of Fe, Zn and Cu.\n\nFew data are available on Sr and Rb in seafood, and the functions\nof these elements in organisms are unknown. The present study\nindicated a global mean Sr concentration of 17.8 mg kg?1 in\nN. norvegicus edible muscle. Levels of Rb (0.23 \u2013 0.67 mg kg?1) were\nlower than those of Sr, in agreement with the literature.26,47,48\n\nAgusa et al.,49 on the other hand, reported higher Rb than Sr\nlevels in some fish species from several locations in Cambodia,\nIndonesia and Thailand. In a study by Seixas and Pierce,50 Octopus\nvulgaris showed Rb levels between 3 and 5 mg kg?1 dry weight,\nsomewhat higher than those found in N. norvegicus. Species of\nLamellibranchiata and Gastropoda showed similar levels of Sr to\nthose observed in N. norvegicus in the present study.37 Another\nstudy reported values around 35 mg kg?1 in other lobsters.33 Some\nfish species contained less Sr,26 while others from Manila Bay,\nespecially demersal fish, accumulated higher levels,47 probably\nowing to high levels of water contamination. A study by Varo36\n\nrevealed lower levels of Sr and Rb in canned shrimp (11 and\n0.2 mg kg?1 respectively).\n\nThe transition metal Mg is important as a cofactor activating a\nhigh number of enzymes to form metal \u2013 enzyme complexes and\nalso as a constituent of certain metalloenzymes.4 For example, the\nenzymatic function of Mn in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism\nand brain function is well known.

According\nto Baden et al.,51 the level of Mn in N. norvegicus specimens\ngives an indication of recent exposure to Mn concentrations in\nthe bottom waters of their habitats. Several authors observed\nsimilar contents of Mn in N. norvegicus29,32,44 and other decapod\ncrustaceans.14,15,17,33 A study by Kress et al.52 showed high\nMn levels in some deep-sea crustaceans (Polycheles tylaphlops,\nAcnthephyra eximia and Aristeus antennatus) from the southeastern\nMediterranean Sea.\n\nNi and Cr are the last two trace elements studied that can be\nconsidered essential, depending on their concentration in tissues.\nAt low levels, Ni is thought to be a factor in hormone, lipid and\ncell membrane metabolism. Insulin response is increased after\nNi ingestion, which may be related to Ni activation of enzymes\nassociated with the breakdown or utilisation of glucose. The most\nimportant physiological role of Cr is also to enhance the action\nof insulin.40 Generally, the concentrations of these elements are\nlow in seafood (0.01 \u2013 0.5 mg kg?1).1,36 In the present study the\ncontent of Ni averaged 0.16 mg kg?1, reaching 0.34 mg kg?1 in\none sample. These levels are in the range of values reported by\nCarvalho et al.26 in fish species but are lower than those reported\nby Pae?z-Osuna et al.14 and Canli et al.53 in lobster (1.5 mg kg?1 dry\nweight) and prawn (?2.7 mg kg?1 dry weight) respectively. The\nhigh values obtained by these two groups of authors are probably\ndue to environmental metal pollution in the studied geographical\nregions. Segar et al.37 also detected high amounts of Ni in mollusc\nspecies. Studies performed on bivalve and cephalopod species\nfrom New Caledonia lagoon also showed high levels of Ni.54,55\n\nThese high values can be explained by the intense land-based\nNi-mining activity in the area and also by urban development and\nlack of efficient wastewater treatment. Levels of Cr were similar\nto those of Ni, with a mean value of 0.13 mg kg?1 and a range\nfrom 0.05 to 0.23 mg kg?1. Some authors reported similar results\nin crustaceans.4,14,15,42 Fish species showed higher levels of Cr\nin some studies (1 \u2013 2.4 mg kg?1 dry weight),26,56 but a study by\nAgusa et al.49 on fish from Southeast Asia showed values in the\nsame range as those obtained in the present study. The low values\n\nfound for Ni and Cr in N. norvegicus edible muscle probably indicate\na non-contaminated catching area.\n\nSe is considered both an essential element and a toxic element\ndepending on its concentration. It is a component of the enzyme\nglutathione peroxidase in human and animal tissues, and Se\ndeficiency is implicated in cardiovascular disease and higher risk\nof cancer of several organs such as the liver and lungs.40 In contrast,\nSe excess can have toxic effects,57 among which is the promotion\nof dental caries.4 Some studies reported a role of Se against the\ntoxicity of Hg, more precisely methyl mercury.4,57 \u2013 59 Although Se\nwas detected in N. norvegicus, the values were near the limit of\nquantification (1.5 mg kg?1 dry weight) and showed a large error\nin variability. However, it can be estimated that levels were around\n0.4 mg kg?1, which is within the range observed in several seafood\nspecies.1,19,57,60 \u2013 62\n\nDietary reference intake (DRI) is a general term encompassing\na set of reference values for specific nutrients: estimated\naverage requirement (EAR), recommended dietary allowance\n(RDA), adequate intake (AI) and tolerable upper intake level\n(UL).63 Some suggestions have been made for mineral reference\nvalues.1,2,4,40,63 Those proposed by Belitz et al.2 and IOM63 are\ngiven in Table 5. Taking into consideration the levels found in the\npresent study, the contribution of each element to the DRI is also\nshown in Table 5. These results allow one to conclude that, in\ngeneral, N. norvegicus is a good source of minerals, particularly Cu,\nZn, Mg, Se and P, with Cu and Se being above the DRI. However,\nthe ULs set by IOM63 for Cu (10 mg day?1 ) and Se (0.4 mg day?1 )\nare above the values obtained in the present study (1.7 mg Cu\nand&lt;0.06 mg Se in a 160 g portion). Additionally, the Mn and Ni\nvalues are minimal, ranging between 3 and 7%. The Na/K ratio\nis high, which can indicate an increased risk of developing high\nblood pressure and cardiovascular disease.64\n\nTable 6 presents data for the non-essential metals Hg, Cd and Pb.\nTo date, no essential function in human life has been attributed\nto these metals.58 Furthermore, their connection with several\ndiseases is well known. Elemental Hg, inorganic Hg (Hg2+) and, in\nparticular, organic forms such as methyl mercuric ion (CH3Hg\n\n+) are\nconsidered neurotoxic, with the brain being the principal target\n\nwww.interscience.wiley.com/jsfa c\u00a9 2009 Society of Chemical Industry J Sci Food Agric 2009; 89: 2572 \u2013 2580\n\n\n\n2\n5\n\n7\n7\n\nChemical characterisation of Nephrops norvegicus www.soci.org\n\nT\na\n\nb\nle\n\n5\n.\n\nD\nie\n\nta\nry\n\nre\nfe\n\nre\nn\n\nce\nin\n\nta\nke\n\n(D\nR\n\nI)\nan\n\nd\nco\n\nn\ntr\n\nib\nu\n\nti\no\n\nn\no\n\nf\nm\n\no\nst\n\nst\nu\n\nd\nie\n\nd\ne\n\nle\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nts\nin\n\nN\nep\n\nh\nro\n\np\ns\n\nn\no\n\nrv\neg\n\nic\nu\n\ns\n(1\n\n6\n0\n\ng\np\n\no\nrt\n\nio\nn\n\n)\n\nV\nal\n\nu\ne\n\nC\nl\n\nN\na\n\nK\nP\n\nS\nC\n\na\nM\n\ng\nFe\n\nZ\nn\n\nC\nu\n\nM\nn\n\nS\ne\n\nN\ni\n\nC\nr\n\nD\nR\n\nIa\n(m\n\ng\n)\n\n2\n3\n\n0\n0\n\nb\n1\n\n5\n0\n\n0\nb\n\n4\n7\n\n0\n0\n\nb\n7\n\n0\n0\n\nc\n8\n\n0\n0\n\n\u2013\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0\nb\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nb\n3\n\n1\n0\n\n\u2013\n4\n\n2\n0\n\nc\n8\n\n\u2013\n1\n\n8\nc\n\n8\n\u2013\n\n1\n1\n\nc\n0\n\n.9\nc\n\n1\n.8\n\n\u2013\n2\n\n.3\nb\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n5\n\nc\n1\n\n.0\nd\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n\u2013\n0\n\n.0\n3\n\n5\nb\n\n%\no\n\nf\nD\n\nR\nIi\n\nn\nN\n\n.n\no\n\nrv\neg\n\nic\nu\n\ns\n3\n\n3\n4\n\n7\n1\n\n2\n5\n\n3\n2\n\n2\n\u2013\n\n2\n8\n\n1\n6\n\n2\n9\n\n\u2013\n3\n\n1\n1\n\n8\n\u2013\n\n4\n0\n\n2\n5\n\n\u2013\n3\n\n5\n1\n\n8\n8\n\n5\n\u2013\n\n7\n1\n\n1\n6\n\ne\n3\n\n5\n9\n\n\u2013\n8\n\n3\n\na\nE\n\nst\nim\n\nat\ne\n\nd\nfo\n\nr\nad\n\nu\nlt\n\ns.\n2\n\n,6\n3\n\nb\nA\n\nd\ne\n\nq\nu\n\nat\ne\n\nin\nta\n\nke\n(A\n\nI)\n.\n\nc\nR\n\ne\nco\n\nm\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nd\ne\n\nd\nd\n\nie\nta\n\nry\nal\n\nlo\nw\n\nan\nce\n\n(R\nD\n\nA\n).\n\nd\nT\n\no\nle\n\nra\nb\n\nle\nu\n\np\np\n\ne\nr\n\nin\nta\n\nke\nle\n\nve\nl(\n\nU\nL)\n\n.\ne\n\nB\nas\n\ne\nd\n\no\nn\n\n0\n.4\n\n0\nm\n\ng\nkg\n\n?1\n.\n\nJ Sci Food Agric 2009; 89: 2572 \u2013 2580 c\u00a9 2009 Society of Chemical Industry www.interscience.wiley.com/jsfa\n\n\n\n2\n5\n\n7\n8\n\nwww.soci.org HM Lourenc?o et al.\n\nTable 6.

The most pronounced damage caused by Cd occurs in the\nkidneys, but high Cd levels are also associated with coronary artery\ndisease, hypertension, emphysema and other chronic pulmonary\ndiseases. Pb also has many adverse health effects, e.g. toxicity\nto renal, endocrine and skeletal systems, but its primary effect is\non the central nervous system.59 It is thought that these three\nelements are also cancerigenic. Depending on the habitat and\nspecies examined, different levels of Hg can be detected. It was\nthe most abundant toxic metal in N. norvegicus, with a mean\ncontent of 0.40 mg kg?1. Two samples exceeded the permitted\nvalue of 0.50 mg kg?1,5,6 reaching about 0.70 mg kg?1. Capelli\net al.44 found similar contents of Hg in N. norvegicus. A study\nby Barghigiani and De Ranieri65 on the same species revealed\nsimilar values for minor length classes but larger values for\nmajor length classes. Another study by Drava et al.17 detected\nhigher levels in red shrimp (A. antennatus). However, in other\ncrustaceans, lower concentrations were found.19,57,66,67 The mean\ncontents of Cd and Pb detected in the present study were\n0.10 and 0.05 mg kg?1 respectively. These values are significantly\nlower than the limits set by the EU5,6 (0.50 mg kg?1 for both\nelements). Several authors reported higher concentrations in some\ncrustacean species, but those samples were harvested from waters\nconsidered polluted.15,53,68,69 Others found similar or lower values\nof Cd11,14,17,19,44,66 and Pb17,19,66 compared with the present study.\nIn a study of Hg and Cd uptake from seawater and food by N.\nnorvegicus,70 all treatments resulted in the accumulation of both\nelements. However, the tissue distribution of the metals differed\nsignificantly among treatments. In the case of edible muscle the\nlevels obtained for Hg and Cd in N. norvegicus can be attributed\nto diet or habitat waters. However, Cd only reached its highest\nconcentration in the hepatopancreas. As for essential elements,\nno significant gender differences were detected in N. norvegicus\nregarding Hg, Pb and Cd levels (P > 0.05). This was also found by\nCanli and Furness13 in tail muscle tissue of the same species.\n\nProvisional tolerable weekly intakes (PTWIs) of 5, 7 and 25 \u00b5g\nkg?1 were established for Hg, Cd and Pb respectively.71,72 Taking\ninto consideration an average weekly consumption of seafood\nproducts in Portugal of 1120 g,73 an average human BW of 60 kg\nand the average Hg, Cd and Pb levels found in this study (Table 6),\nthe estimated weekly intakes of Cd (1.9 \u00b5g kg?1 BW) and Pb (0.9 \u00b5g\nkg?1 BW) are lower than their established PTWIs. In contrast, the\nPTWI for Hg is exceeded (7.5 \u00b5g kg?1 BW) if N. norvegicus is\nconsumed in this way (160 g portion \u00d7 7 days). However, it is very\nunlikely that a person will consume that quantity of this species in\na single week, so the value can be considered overestimated.\n\nPositive Pearson correlations occurred between some elements,\nthe most significant being those of Mn with Na (R2 = 0.878,\n\nP = 0.000), Ca (R2 = 0.746, P = 0.001), Mg (R2 = 0.867,\nP = 0.000), Fe (R2 = 0.742, P = 0.001) and Ni (R2 = 0.815,\nP = 0.000). These correlations can be explained by the similar\nchemistry of the Mn and Mg ions4 and probably Ca and Na and the\nelectrochemical affinity of Mn with other transition metals such as\nFe and Ni.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNephrops norvegicus can be a good source of protein and have a\nrich mineral content. The major elements present were Cl > Na >\nK > P > S > Ca > Mg followed by trace elements Br > Fe > Sr ? Zn\n> Cu > Mn > Rb > Se > Ni > Cr. Considering the DRI, this species\nmay constitute a good supply of several essential elements such as\nCu, Zn, Mg and P. However, the Na/K ratio is high, which can be a\nconcern for consumers with cardiovascular diseases. The contents\nof Pb and Cd are low and consumption of N. norvegicus is not a\nconcern in this respect. Regarding the PTWI for Hg, the studied\nspecies should be consumed in moderation, preferably no more\nthan four 160 g meals per week.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank PNAB/EU Data Collection Regulation, in\nparticular Dr Cristina Silva and Dr Francisco Leote, for providing\nN. norvegicus species and their advice on the biological parameters.\nWe also wish to thank to Dr Amparo Gonc?alves for her help with\nthe statistical analysis.

All species presented a high protein level, around 20 g (100 g)\n-1\n\n and a \n\nmineral content of about 1 g (100 g)\n-1\n\n. Similar patterns of macro, trace and ultra trace \n\nelements were observed for all studied fish species, although, some different levels \n\noccurred among them. The main elements were K, Na, P, Mg and Ca, followed by Zn, \n\nFe, Cu, Cr, Mn and Ni. Cadmium, Hg and Pb concentrations, obtained in this study, \n\nallow concluding that these species do not present a risk for human consumption. In \n\naddition, they contain almost all essential elements at concentrations sufficient to suit \n\nthe dietary reference intake. Nevertheless, P. maxima contribution for elemental dietary \n\nreference intake is minor in comparison to the other three species. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Sparus aurata; Dicentrarchus labrax; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Psetta \n\nmaxima; proximate composition; mineral content. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n1. Introduction  \n\nFish is a good source of proteins and lipids of high biological value, with long chain \n\npolyunsaturated fatty acids, and also liposoluble vitamins (Belitz, 2004) and essential \n\nelements (Oehlensch\u00e4ger, 1997). Epidemiological studies indicate that populations with \n\na fish diet have a lower risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension and cancer \n\n(Simopolpoulos, 1997). Lack of essential elements, like Na, K, P, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu \n\nand Zn leads to improper or poor enzyme mediated metabolic functions and results in \n\norgan malfunctions, chronical diseases and finally in death (Oehlensch\u00e4ger, 1997). \n\nHowever, in spite of fish being considered a food product indispensable in a balanced \n\ndiet, such products can, to a certain extent, be contaminated with some chemicals \n\ncoming from several sources (industrial waste discharge and other anthropogenic \n\nactivities). Some of these chemicals that can be accumulated are Hg, Cd and Pb. These \n\nelements can be toxic even in low concentrations, causing severe human health \n\ndisorders (Francesconi, 2007). \n\nNowadays, aquaculture comprises an important alternative to those traditional forms \n\nof fish stock. In Portugal, farmed fish play, even today, a small part comparing with \n\nfisheries (EC, 2008). According Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \n\nNations (FAO), in the year of 2030, aquaculture will dominate the market and probably \n\nonly less than the half of consumed fish products will come of traditional fisheries \n\n(FAO, 2003). Among farmed fish species in EU, gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata \n\nLinnaeus 1758), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax Linnaeus 1758), rainbow \n\ntrout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum 1792) and turbot (Psetta maxima Linnaeus 1758) \n\nobserved special attention. Their productions have been increasing in the last years, \n\nbeing generally commercialised as fresh fish (Testi et al., 2006). \n\n\n\nIn this context, the aim of this study was to determine the proximate composition and \n\nthe essential and toxic element contents in the edible muscle of gilthead sea bream, \n\nEuropean sea bass, rainbow trout and turbot collected in Portuguese fish farms. \n\nAdditionally, these values were compared with the dietary reference intakes (DRI) and \n\nmaximum limit levels. \n\n \n\n2. Materials and methods \n\n2.1 Raw material and sample preparation \n\nS. aurata, D. labrax, O. mykiss and P. maxima were purchased from several \n\ncommercial farms located in Portugal. Immediately after collection, farmed fish were \n\nstored in ice inside an insulated box and transferred to the laboratory where specimens \n\nwere weighed, measured (total body length) and processed. Mean length, mean weight \n\nand number of sampled fish are presented in Table 1. Muscle tissue from each fish was \n\nminced, mixed and homogenised in a food blender. Homogenised samples were \n\nvacuum-sealed in clean plastic bags, coded for easy identification, and stored at \u201321 \u00baC \n\nuntil required for analysis.  \n\n2.2 Sample analysis \n\nProximate composition - protein (nitrogen x 6.25; Kjeldahl method), fat (Soxhlet \n\nextraction with ethyl ether), moisture (sample dried overnight at 105\u00baC), and ash \n\n(sample incineration at 500 \u00ba C to constant weight) - was done according to Association \n\nof Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methodologies (AOAC, 1998). Analytical data \n\nfor proximate composition are reported as g (100 g) \n\u20131\n\n on a wet weight basis. One \n\ncertified reference material was tested (n = 4) in the same conditions as the samples, in \n\norder to assess analytical method accuracy: SMRD-2000 (Canned matrix meat) from \n\nSwedish Meats R &amp; D and Scan Foods/ National Food Administration. The values of \n\n\n\nthe reference material were 1.63 \u00b1 0.05 (1.62 \u00b1 0.06), 14.3 \u00b1 0.4 (14.4 \u00b1 0.1), 68.8 \u00b1 0.1 \n\n(68.7 \u00b1 0.1) and 2.65 \u00b1 0.07 (2.69 \u00b1 0.03) for nitrogen, fat, moisture and ash, \n\nrespectively. The values of present measurements are given in parentheses. The values \n\nobtained were in good agreement with the certified values. \n\n \n\nPotassium (K), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), \n\nzinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) \n\nanalysis was based on the methods described by Jorhem (2000). Muscle samples (5 or \n\n10 g wet weight) were dried and then ashed at 500 \u00baC with gradual increase in \n\ntemperature. Nitric acid 65 % (w/w) was added, and the solution obtained was \n\nevaporated to dryness. The final residue was dissolved in nitric acid 15 % (v/v). \n\nDetermination of K, Na, Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb was performed by \n\nflame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) in a spectrometer model Spectr AA-20 \n\nwith deuterium background correction (Varian Australia, Mulgrave, Victoria, \n\nAustralia).  \n\n Phosphorus was determined spectrophotometrically according to an ISO standard \n\n(1996), in an UNICAM UV 5 220 spectrophotometer (ATI UNICAM, Cambridge, UK). \n\nSamples (5 g) were incinerated and dissolved in HCl (20 % w/v). Colorimetric \n\nmeasurements of the absorbance of a yellow compound from the reaction of P with a \n\nmixture of ammonium vanadate and ammonium molybdate were performed.  \n\nTotal mercury (Hg) was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry \n\n(CVAAS) using Coleman model MAS-50D mercury analyser system (Bacharach, Inc., \n\nPittsburgh, USA). Of each specimen, 1 g of homogenised muscle tissue was digested \n\nwith concentrated sulphuric acid. Then, Hg in the sample (Hg\n0\n and Hg\n\n+2\n\n2\n) was oxidised, \n\nwith potassium permanganate 5 % (w/v), to Hg\n2+\n\n. After reducing the Hg\n2+ \n\nto Hg\n0\n with \n\n\n\nstannous chloride 20 % (w/v), the volatile Hg\n0\n was bubbled into the closed system of \n\nthe MAS 50D analyser (?=253.7 nm). The method used was developed by Hatch and \n\nOtt (1968) and described in detail by Joiris et al. (1991). \n\nAll analyses were carried out in duplicate, using the external calibration method. \n\nDetection limits (calculated by residual standard deviation from linear regression) (DL, \n\nmg kg\n-1\n\n, wet wt) were 0.01 (K), 0.09 (Na), 0.01 (P), 0.02 (Mg), 0.08 (Ca), 0.06 (Zn), \n\n0.32 (Fe), 0.02 (Cu), 0.01 (Mn), 0.02 (Ni), 0.09 (Cr), 0.01 (Cd), 0.02 (Pb) and 0.01 for \n\nHg. \n\nAll laboratory ware was cleaned with HNO3 (10 %) or HCl (20 %) for 24-48 h and \n\nrinsed with ultra pure water (18.2 M?cm). All chemical were reagent grade. \n\nCommercial standard solutions (1000 mg L\n-1\n\n) for all elements were used (Merck). \n\nAnalytical data for elements are reported as g kg \n\u20131 \n\nor mg kg\n-1\n\n on a wet weight basis.  \n\nFour certified reference materials were tested in the same conditions as the samples, \n\nin order to assess analytical method accuracy: LUTS-1 (Non defatted lobster \n\nhepatopancreas), TORT-2 (Lobster hepatopancreas), DORM-2 (Dogfish muscle) from \n\nNational Research Council of Canada and SMRD-2000 (Canned matrix meat) from \n\nSwedish Meats R &amp; D and Scan Foods/ National Food Administration. The determined \n\nvalues for all elements were in good agreement with the certified values (Table 2). \n\n2.3 Statistical analysis \n\nTo test the normality and the homogeneity of variance of data, the Kolmogrov-\n\nSmirnov\u2019s test and Levene\u2019s F-test, were used, respectively. Data, which corroborate \n\nthese assumptions, were analysed by the ANOVA distribution to determine the \n\ndifference between the mineral levels in muscle tissue sampled from farmed fish. When \n\nthose conditions were not verified, data were tested non-parametrically with Mann-\n\n\n\nWhitney\u2019s U-test. Statistical significance was considered when p<0.05. All data analysis \n\nwas performed using STATISTICA (Statsoft, Inc. USA, 2000). \n\n \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\nProximate composition for the four studied fish is reported in Table 3. Data relative \n\nto macro and trace/ultra trace elements are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. \n\nSimilar patterns were observed for these two groups of elements for the four farmed fish \n\nspecies, suggesting that each element may have the same physiological importance for \n\nall organisms. In general terms, the lowest element concentrations were found in P. \n\nmaxima. The main elements were K, Na, P, Mg and Ca, followed by Zn, Fe, Cu, Cr, Mn \n\nand Ni. Each group will be discussed separately. Considering the elemental \n\nconcentrations found in the present work, DRI percentages for each element, in a 160 g \n\nportion (a per capita fish consumption of 57.1 kg, which represents ? 160 g fish person-\n\n1\n day\n\n-1\n (FAO,2007) are calculated. Histograms are shown in Figures 1 and 2, in order to \n\ncompare DRI percentages in the four farmed fish species. Total concentrations of Hg, \n\nPb and Cd, metals considered toxic and regulated by the EU Commission (EU, 2006, \n\n2008), are summarised in Table 6. \n\n \n\n3.1 Proximate composition \n\nThe results obtained for proximate composition were similar to those reported by \n\nseveral authors (Alasalvar et al., 2002; Erkan and \u00d6zden, 2007; Huidobro et al., 2001; \n\nTesti et al., 2006). Average moisture content ranged between 67.4 and 75.3 g (100 g)\n-1\n\n, \n\nfor D. labrax and O. mykiss, respectively. As expected, fat content was inversely \n\nproportional to moisture content and the highest value was found in D. labrax (13.1 g \n\n(100 g)\n-1\n\n). The different fat levels are probably due to the dietary history of each fish \n\n\n\nspecies. All study farmed fish presented a high protein level, around 20 g (100 g)\n-1\n\n, \n\nwhich is in accordance with Belitz (2004). Ash content was superior to 1 g (100 g)\n-1\n\n in \n\nall samples, reaching 1.40 g (100 g)\n-1\n\n in S. aurata. The lowest level was found in \n\nP.maxima, however the value is in accordance with the results reported by some authors \n\n(Busetto et al., 2008; \u00d6zogul et al., 2006).  \n\n \n\n3.2. Macro elements (K, P, Na, Mg, Ca) \n\nThese elements are considered essential and their main functions include skeletal \n\nstructure, maintenance of colloidal system and regulation of acid-base equilibrium. \n\nPotassium was the most abundant element in the four studied fish species; the minimum \n\nvalue was obtained for P. maxima, about 3.0 g kg\n-1\n\n and the largest concentration was \n\nfound in D. labrax (5.7 g kg\n-1\n\n). No significant differences were found between levels of \n\nK in D. labrax and O. mykiss. S. aurata showed an intermediate level, around 4.7 g kg\n-1\n\n. \n\nThese values are similar to those reported by Orban et al. (2000) and Erkan et al. (2007) \n\nin D. puntazzo, D. labrax and S. aurata, respectively. The second most abundant \n\nelement in the studied fish species was P. No significant differences were found for the \n\nvalues of P, among the fish species, with the exception of P. maxima that presented the \n\nlowest value (1.8 g kg\n-1\n\n). The mean contents were situated between 2.5 and 2.7 g kg\n-1\n\n \n\nfor D. labrax, S. aurata and O. mykiss. These values are in agreement with the statement \n\nof Oehlenschl\u00e4ger (1997) that the P content in marine fish muscle is on average close to \n\n2 g kg\n-1\n\n. One study of Vlieg et al. (1991) also revealed values around 2.5 g kg\n-1\n\n for trout \n\nspecies (Salmo trutta and Oncorhynchus mykiss). Nevertheless, the levels obtained in \n\nthe present study were lower than those reported by other authors (Erkan et al., 2007; \n\nFuentes et al., 2010; Gokoglu et al., 2004) for the same species. In the main elemental \n\nprofile observed for the studied farmed fish species, Na was the third element. As \n\n\n\nconfirmed by Oehlenschl\u00e4ger (1997) the levels of Na were lower than K ones. The \n\nconcentrations of Na found in this study were around 1.0 g kg\n-1\n\n. Sodium levels of D. \n\nlabrax and O. mykiss did not show significant differences. Other studies showed lower \n\nlevels of Na when compared with the present work in D. labrax, S. aurata (Erkan et al., \n\n2007), and O. mykiss (Gokoglu et al., 2004). However, similar contents were reported \n\nby Martinez-Valverde et al. (2000) for blue whiting, hake and sole. Magnesium and Ca \n\nwere the last macro elements found in the elemental profile, being Mg concentrations \n\nhigher than Ca ones. This fact is in accordance to Oehlenschl\u00e4ger (1997), that, in \n\ngeneral, fish contains more Mg than Ca. No significant differences were observed \n\nbetween values of these two elements in D. labrax and O. mykiss (approximately 0.37 g \n\nkg\n-1 \n\nand 0.30 g kg\n-1\n\n, respectively). S. aurata showed intermediate levels, but Ca \n\nconcentrations were also not significantly different from the values of the other two \n\nspecies referred above. As with the other macro elements, P. maxima showed the lowest \n\namounts of these two metals, 0.24 g kg\n-1\n\n for Mg and 0.11 g kg\n-1\n\n for Ca. Values obtained \n\nfor Mg were expected, but for Ca they were low when compared with previous research \n\nfor the same species (Aubourg et al., 2007; Erkan et a., 2007; Gokoglu et al., 2004) or \n\ndifferent ones (Martinez-Valverde et al., 2000). Nevertheless, Fuentes et al. (2010) \n\nobserved Mg levels lower than those obtained in the present study. The differences \n\nfound among data reported by several authors could be attributed to a variety of factors \n\nincluding availability and type of food, dietary ingredients and reduced activity of the \n\ncultured fish. \n\n \n\n3.3 Trace and ultra trace elements (Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Cr, Ni) \n\nIn general, these essential elements are important components of hormones, enzymes \n\nand enzyme activators. They are associated with specific proteins in metalloenzymes, \n\nwhich produce a unique catalytic function. Zinc, Fe and Cu were the elements \n\n\n\npresenting the highest values of this group, being Zn the most abundant. P. maxima \n\nshowed the highest average content of Zn (6.8 mg kg\n-1\n\n) and S. aurata the lowest \n\naverage value (4.9 mg kg\n-1\n\n); these concentrations were statistically different. No \n\nsignificant differences for Zn levels were observed among D. labrax, O. mykiss and S. \n\naurata, however Zn level in O. mykiss was also not different from P. maxima one. In \n\nliterature, different Zn concentrations in seafood can be found. Some studies performed \n\nin farmed fish indicated lower levels than those observed in the present work (Dugo et \n\nal., 2006; Erkan et al., 2007; Fuentes et al., 2010) and other studies revealed higher Zn \n\nlevels when compared to the levels found in this study (Alasalvar et al., 2002; Gokoglu \n\net al., 2004). On the other hand, compared with studies on farmed and wild P. maxima \n\n(Aubourg et al., 2006), wild trout (Scherz and Kirchhoff, 2006; Vlieg et al., 1991), and \n\nwild S. aurata (Canli and Atli, 2003; T\u00fcrkmen et al., 2008), the results of the present \n\nwork were similar. For example, in a study performed on fish species from Northeast \n\nAtlantic (Celik and Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, 2004), the Zn content ranged from 2.1 mg kg\n-1\n\n to \n\n8.7 mg kg\n-1\n\n. This shows that Zn concentrations in fish species are variable and it is not \n\npossible to establish a small range of values. Iron levels were around 5 mg kg\n-1\n\n for D. \n\nlabrax and S. aurata. Differently from the Zn profile, the lowest Fe content was found \n\nin P. maxima (2.6 mg kg\n-1\n\n). The average Fe values found in O. mykiss and S. aurata \n\nwere not statistically different from the other two species. The lowest Fe content found \n\nin P maxima can be explained by the low percentage of dark flesh in this fish. In 1995, \n\nLall (1995) collect several Fe data, showing a wide range of values in many marine fish \n\nand crustaceans (0.8 to 373 mg kg\n-1\n\n). The author explained that this wide range would \n\nbe probably due to metal and bone contamination of fishery products and differences in \n\nanalytical methodology. In fact, according to Oehlenschl\u00e4ger (1997), Fe is present in \n\nconcentrations of approximately 5.0 mg kg\n-1\n\n in marine fish species. Therefore, levels \n\n\n\nfound in the present study were in the range found by Oehlenschl\u00e4ger (1997) and other \n\nauthors (Aubourg et al., 2007; Canli and Atli, 2003; Dural et al., 2007; Fuentes et al., \n\n2010; Gokoglu et al., 2004; T\u00fcrkmen et al., 2005), for similar fish species. Nevertheless, \n\nsome authors reported higher levels than those of the present study (Alasalvar et al., \n\n2002; Erkan et al., 2007; T\u00fcrkmen et al., 2008; Uluozlu et al., 2007; Vlieg et al., 1991). \n\nCopper was the third element in the profile of trace elements, except for P. maxima. \n\nSignificant differences were found when comparing the lowest Cu average level, 0.17 \n\nmg kg\n-1\n\n, found in P maxima, and the highest one, 0.71 mg kg\n-1\n\n, found in S. aurata, D. \n\nlabrax and O. mykiss showed intermediate levels, approximately 0.45 mg kg\n-1\n\n, being the \n\naverage value, found in D. labrax, not statistically different from the average values \n\nfound in S. aurata and O. mykiss. In literature, some comparative studies between wild \n\nand farmed fish showed that, in general wild fish present a lower Cu content than \n\nfarmed fish (Alam et al, 2002; Alasalvar et al., 2002; Aubourg et al., 2007; Ikem and \n\nEgilla, 2008). These different contents can be attributed to the different type of food in \n\nwild marine environment and farm systems. In fact, Cu levels reported in the present \n\nstudy were higher than those verified by other authors, for the wild fish species (Canli \n\nand Atli, 2003; Dural et al., 2007; Fuentes et al., 2010; Gokoglu et al., 2004; T\u00fcrkmen \n\net al., 2005; Uuozlu et al., 2007). \n\n The three studied essential ultra trace elements were Mn, Cr and Ni. Significant \n\ndifferences were detected between Mn levels in two of the study fish species: S. aurata \n\nshowed the lowest average value (0.14 mg kg\n-1\n\n) and P. maxima the highest one (0.32 \n\nmg kg\n-1\n\n). The differences in the Mn contents of D. labrax and O. mykiss were found to \n\nbe non-significant. Statistically, and regarding Mn values, D. labrax and P. maxima as \n\nwell as O. mykiss and S. aurata were identical. Manganese levels found in the present \n\nstudy were low and inferior to other values reported by some authors for similar farmed \n\n\n\nfish species (Alasalvar et al., 2002; Erkan et al., 2007; Gokoglu et al., 2004). Studies \n\nperformed by Aubourg et al. (2007) in farmed P. maxima, T\u00fcrkmen et al. (2005) in wild \n\nS.aurata and Vlieg et al. (1991) in wild O.mykiss, showed Mn levels comparable to \n\nthose found in the present work. In contrast, Mn levels in farmed D. labrax from Greece \n\nand Spain were lower than the values reported by the present study (Fuentes et al., \n\n2010). The levels of Cr were approximately about 0.30 mg kg\n-1\n\n. No significant \n\ndifferences were found among the Cr contents of the four studied fish species. In \n\nliterature, it is possible to find a wide range of Cr levels in fish species, partially due to \n\nenvironmental pollution. For example, the study performed by Garg and Krishna \n\n(2006), in fish from Indian coastal areas, showed values between 0.06 and 29.9 mg kg\n-1\n\n. \n\nIn fact, results reported in the present work were similar to those reported by some \n\nauthors in S. aurata and D. labrax from Mediterrean and Aegean seas (Canli and Atli, \n\n2003; T\u00fcrkmen et al., 2005, 2009; Uluozlu et al., 2007), but lower or higher than those \n\nfound by others (Ikem and Egilla, 2008; T\u00fcrkmen et al., 2008; Tuzen., 2009 or Alam et \n\nal., 2002; Alasalvar et al., 2002; Ersoy et al., 2006). Nickel was the ultra trace element \n\nthat showed the lowest values of the group (between 0.02 and 0.04 mg kg\n-1\n\n). As for Cr, \n\nno significant differences among Ni contents were detected for all studied fish species. \n\nStudies on Ni levels in farmed fish species similar to those studied in the present work \n\nare scarce. One study performed by Alasalvar et al. (2002) showed higher Ni \n\nconcentrations in D. labrax than observed in our study. In general, values found in the \n\npresent study were lower than those reported by others in wild fish species (T\u00fcrkmen et \n\nal., 2005, 2008, 2009; Tuzen, 2009; Uluozlu et al., 2007). These differences are \n\nprobably due to the environmental pollution affecting the catch areas. Only two studies, \n\none performed in farmed and wild Cyprinus carpio from Lake Kasumigaura, Japan \n\n\n\n(Alam et al., 2002) and other performed in wild D. labrax from Ria de Aveiro, Portugal \n\n(P\u00e9rez Cid et al., 2001) showed low Ni values, as in the present study. \n\n \n\n3.4 Toxic elements (Cd, Hg, Pb) \n\nCadmium, Hg and Pb do not show any essential function in human life and are \n\nconsidered harmful. In addition, their connection with several diseases is well known. \n\nMercury in its several forms is regarded as neurotoxic, Pb affects the central nervous \n\nsystem and Cd has a deleterious effect upon the kidneys. \n\nThe mean values of Cd were quite low, around 0.01 mg kg\n-1\n\n. Nevertheless, \n\nsignificant differences were observed among the Cd levels for four studied fish species. \n\nIn fact, Cd concentrations in D. labrax, were different from those of the other three fish \n\nspecies, and those of S. aurata were not different of Cd levels found in P. maxima and \n\nO. mykiss. There were no significant differences among Pb contents of the four studied \n\nfish species. The mean values situated between 0.02 and 0.05 mg kg\n-1\n\n. The values \n\nobtained for these two metals in the present work are in accordance to those reported by \n\nsome studies in farmed fish species (Alam et al., 2002; Ersoy et al., 2006; Fernandes et \n\nal., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2008). Nevertheless, D. labrax from two Sicilian farms (Dugo \n\net al., 2006) and one Greek farm (Alasalvar et al., 2002) showed higher levels than Cd \n\nand Pb concentrations found in this study. In general, wild fish showed higher Pb and \n\nCd contents than farmed ones (Canli and Atli, 2003; Dural et al., 2007; T\u00fcrkmen et al., \n\n2005, 2008, 2009; Tuzen, 2009; Uluozlu et al., 2007). Mercury was the toxic metal that \n\nshowed the highest levels of this elemental group. The minimum was observed in S. \n\naurata (0.04 mg kg\n-1\n\n) and the maximum was attained in D. labrax (0.21 mg kg\n-1\n\n), \n\nalthough the mean levels in these two fish species were not statistically different. The \n\nmean concentrations presented by O. mykiss and P. maxima were similar. Due to \n\n\n\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors, very different Hg concentrations in seafood can be \n\nobserved. In farmed fish, feeds are supposed to be the main source of Hg. Literature \n\nreporting Hg levels for these four studied fish species is scarce. Some studies performed \n\nin other farmed fish species showed similar or lower Hg values than those determined in \n\nthe present work (Dewailly et al., 2007; Easton et al., 2002; Ikem and Egilla, 2008; \n\nUre\u00f1a et al., 2007). Tuzen (2009) reported a similar Hg content for P. maximma (45 \u00b5g \n\nkg\n-1\n\n). On the other hand, studies on farmed tuna species revealed higher values than \n\nthose observed by the present work (Padula et al., 2008; Vizzini et al., 2010). The mean \n\nvalues of Cd, Pb and Hg, observed in the four studied fish species did not surpass the \n\nestablished limits (Cd: 0.05 mg kg\n-1\n\n, Pb: 0.30 mg kg\n-1\n\n, Hg: 0.50 or 1.0 mg kg\n-1\n\n) by EU \n\n(EU, 2006, 2008). \n\n \n\n3.5. Dietary reference and provisional tolerable weekly element intakes \n\nSince farmed fish are now a significant diet source in south European countries, \n\nintake of macro, trace and ultra trace elements is of utmost important. Taking into \n\nconsideration the proposed levels for DRI by Institute of Medicine of the National \n\nAcademies of USA (IOM) (2005), the contribution of each studied element to the DRI \n\nfor the four fish species was calculated (Figure 1 - macro elements and Figure 2 - trace \n\nand ultra trace elements). Results show that studied farmed fish are a good source of P, \n\ncontributing to more than 40 - 50 % of the DRI. These fish may also significantly \n\ncontribute to the DRI of K, Mg and Na, representing 9 \u2013 19 % of the DRI. The Na/K \n\nratio is inferior to 1 which indicates a low risk of developing high blood pressure and \n\ncardiovascular disease (Astorga Espa\u00f1a et al., 2007). Of the various macro elements \n\nstudied, Ca is the element that shows the lowest percentage contribution for DRI, which \n\nis in agreement with the fact that fish, is considered a poor source of Ca (Lall, 1995). \n\n\n\nThe contributions for DRI of Zn, Fe and Cu are also important. Moreover, Mn and Ni \n\npercentages are small, ranging between 1 and 3 %. In all studied fish species, Cr \n\nconcentrations are above the DRI (data not show in histogram). Until now, no tolerable \n\nupper intake level (UL) was set for Cr. However, according to Council for Responsible \n\nNutrition (CRN) (Hathcock, 2004) Cr supplements at levels up to 1,000 \u00b5g per day are \n\nregarded as safe for adults. This intake is above the results found in this study (0.04 \u2013 \n\n0.05 mg Cr in a 160 g portion). In general, P. maxima showed the lowest contents of \n\nmost elements and obviously their contribution for DRI was lower than that of the other \n\nthree species. \n\nA joint committee of Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization \n\n(FAO/WHO) (WHO, 1999, 2003) established provisional tolerable weekly intakes \n\n(PTWI) for Cd (7 \u00b5g kg-1 body weight), Hg (5 \u00b5g kg-1 body weight) and Pb (25 \u00b5g kg-1 \n\nbody weight). Considering a weekly average consumption of seafood products in \n\nPortugal of 1120 g (160 g / day) (FAO, 2007), an average human body weight of 60 kg \n\nand the average Cd, Hg and Pb concentrations observed in this study (Table 6), \n\nestimated weekly intakes of the three metals were calculated. The values found for Cd \n\n(? 0.2 \u00b5g kg-1 body weight), Hg (1.1 \u2013 2.6 \u00b5g kg-1 body weight) and Pb (0.4 \u2013 0.9 \u00b5g kg-\n\n1\n body weight) are lower than established PTWIs. \n\n \n\n4. Conclusions \n\nThis study revealed that consumption of farmed D. labrax, S. aurata, O. mykiss and \n\nP. maxima does not pose a health risk problem to Portuguese from estimated dietary \n\nintakes of toxic elements. In addition, they are a good source of essential elements, \n\ncontributing for the DRI, especially regarding P, K, Mg and Zn. Nevertheless, P. \n\nmaxima contribution for elemental DRI is minor in comparison to the other three \n\n\n\nspecies. This study supports the importance of promoting consumption of fish, and in \n\nthis context, farmed fish and will also contribute to the Portuguese food composition \n\ndatabase. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe authors are grateful to staffs of DGV-Lisbon, for the collection of farmed fish \n\nsamples.

Helena M Lourenc?o,1 Ca?tia Pereira,1 Maria F Martins,1\nMaria L Carvalho,3 Matilde Castro2 and Maria L Nunes1\n1Instituto Nacional de Recursos Biolo?gicos, INRB-IP/IPIMAR, Av.

Prof. Gama Pinto 2, 1649-003\nLisboa, Portugal\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Mercury is a well-known toxic element present in seafood. Nevertheless some antioxidants, like\nselenium, as an integral component of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, and ?-tocopherol having a protective\nrole against it, are present as well. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of total mercury (HgT),\norganic mercury (HgOrg), Se and ?-tocopherol in some adult deep-water fish species caught off Portuguese waters.\n\nRESULTS: Levels of HgT were above EU limits in 6% of Lophius spp. and Aphanopus carbo, 2% of Lepidorhombus\nspp. and 70% of Helicolenus dactylopterus. HgOrg represented the major fraction (more than 84%) of HgT in all\nstudied muscles. The selenium concentration in muscle was similar in all species (about 0.4 mg kg?1 wet weight)\nand the highest level of ?-tocopherol (70 mg kg?1 wet weight) was found in Aphanopus carbo.\n\nCONCLUSION: The muscle of all species studied is a good source of selenium, but only can give a small\ncontribution of ?-tocopherol. Attending to the provisional tolerable weekly intake established by the WHO/FAO\nfor methylmercury, it appears that the species studied should be consumed sparingly.\n? 2008 Society of Chemical Industry\n\nKeywords: fish; total and organic mercury; antioxidants; AAS; HPLC; EDXRF\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThere is a much concern about the amount and\nquality of the nutrients that are supplied by the diet\nto maintain human health and well-being.1 Although\nseafood products are well known for their contribution\nto health, there are several types of toxic substance\nfrom natural and/or anthropogenic origins that can\ncontaminate them.2\n\nContaminant metals, such as mercury, do not\nshow any essential function in life and, because of\ntheir toxicity, are considered harmful elements. These\nmetals can be toxic for humans, even at very low\nconcentrations.3 They can be assimilated, stored and\nconcentrated by organisms, through the food chain,\nresulting in physiological damage.4,5\n\nRegarding these toxic metal ions, most of the\nchemical reactions that explain their toxicity at\ncellular level involve electron transfer, formation of\nfree radicals and their influence on DNA, with\npossible consequences in mutagenicity, genotoxicity\nand carcinogenicity.6 Mercury is a contaminant metal\nthat is naturally present in the environment. This\ncontaminant is present at low level in water systems,\n\nbut bioconcentrates in the aquatic food chain, reaching\nits highest level in large and old predatory fish and\nmarine mammals. Organic mercury (HgOrg) is found\nmainly in fish as methylmercury. The exposure to\nmercury, especially to organic mercury, results in\nneurological and renal damage and has potentially\nharmful effects on cardiovascular diseases as well.7\n\nAlmost all elements considered to be essential can\nbe found in different levels in edible parts of marine\nfish, supplying macro and trace elements to the\nhuman diet.1 In addition, there is growing evidence\nthat micronutrient intake has a significant effect on\nthe toxicity and carcinogenesis caused by various\nchemicals. Micronutrients can affect the toxicity of\nmetals by interacting with them at several points in\nthe body: absorption and excretion, transport, binding\nto target proteins, metabolism and sequestration of\ntoxic metals and in secondary mechanisms of toxicity.8\n\nConsequently, if the human diet is deficient in\nmicronutrients it is possible to predispose to toxicity\nfrom non-essential metals. Seafood has received\nattention as a possible modifier of methylmercury\ndistribution in a way that protects organisms exposed\n\n?

It is an integral component of the\nenzyme glutathione peroxidase, which, together with\nvitamin E and catalase and superoxide dismutase\nenzymes, acts as an antioxidant, thereby protecting\ncells against oxidative damage.10,11 Several studies\nhave shown that antioxidants like selenium offer\nsome protection against methylmercury and inorganic\nmercury,8,9 thus selenium deficiently accentuates the\ntoxicity caused by heavy metals.10 Fish fat and liver\nare significant sources of fat-soluble vitamins, A and\nD. Also present are vitamins E (tocopherol) and K.11\n\nVitamin E is an antioxidant and prevents free radical\ninjury caused by methylmercury.8\n\nVitamins are organic compounds that are indis-\npensable in very small amounts in the diet. They\nform a heterogeneous group of substances and are\nvital nutrients. Some have specific and individual\nfunctions to promote growth or reproduction, or to\nmaintain health and life.12 ?-Tocopherol has the high-\nest biological activity among the different forms of\nvitamin E. Since ?-tocopherol is the major form\ndetected in marine animal tissue, vitamin E values\nmost likely parallel ?-tocopherol values. In biologi-\ncal systems, vitamin E functions as an antioxidant\nto protect cellular lipid components by donation of\nthe phenolic hydrogen to a free radical, thus inhibit-\ning the chain reaction of free radical propagation.13\n\nIn addition, the in vitro, cellular and animal studies,\nwhich are impressive both in quantity and quality,\nleave no doubt that vitamin E, the most impor-\ntant fat-soluble antioxidant, protects animals against\nvarious types of oxidative stress.14 Furthermore, dif-\nferent antioxidants seem to act synergistically, sele-\nnium can enhance tocopherol activity and it appears\nthat the protective role of these two antioxidants\nis cumulative,10,11 so supplementation with vitamin\nE might be more effective if combined with other\nmicronutrients.14\n\nThe main objective of this work was to evaluate\nthe levels of total and organic mercury and some\nantioxidants in tissues of some deep-water fish species\ncaught off the Portuguese coast and to establish\nsuitable relationships between the animal length\nand weight and accumulation of these elements. In\naddition, the comparison of results obtained with\nmaximum levels fixed by a European Commission\nregulation15 and with the provisional tolerable weekly\nintake (PTWI) recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO\nExpert Committee on Food additives16,17 and the\ncomparison of antioxidant content in the muscle\nand their daily intake requirements were a second\ngoal.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\nSample collection and preparation\nFor this experiment fish samples were collected\nbetween 2004 and 2006. The species Lophius\n\nspp. (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa, angler\nand black-bellied angler, respectively) (n = 33) and\nHelicolenus dactylopterus (blackbelly rosefish) (n =\n50) were obtained during several bottom trawl\nresearch surveys carried out by the Portuguese\nInstitute for Marine Research (INRB-IP/IPIMAR)\nalong the Portuguese coast. Aphanopus carbo (black\nscabbardfish) (n = 50) were caught off Sesimbra\nand Lepidorhombus spp (Lepidorhombus boscii and\nL. whiffiagonis, fourspotted megrim and megrim)\n(n = 53) in the Peniche area. Total length (cm),\nweight (g) and the sex of all fish were recorded.\nMuscle of all fish samples and liver of Lophius spp.\nand Aphanopus carbo were removed and stored at\n?30 ?C for further analyses. For organic mercury\nand selenium determination, fish samples were\nfreeze dried for 48 h at ?45 ?C and low pressure\n(approximately 10?1 atm). Samples were powdered\nand stored under controlled moisture conditions until\nfurther analysis.\n\nSample analysis\nTotal and organic mercury (HgT and Hgorg) were\ndetermined by atomic absortion spectrometry using\nan automatic Hg analyser (Leco apparatus AMA 254,\nSt. Joseph, MI, USA). Hgorg was extracted from\nsamples using the method described by Scerbo and\nBarghigiani.18 An aliquot of the lyophilised sample\n(0.2 \u2013 2 g) was hydrolysed with hydrobromic acid (47%\nw/w) and then the Hgorg species were extracted\nfrom the sample with toluene. Finally, a cysteine\nsolution was added to remove the organic mercury\ncompounds from the toluene. Approximately 100 mg\nof wet tissue (for total Hg) or 100 \u00b5L of cysteine\nextract (for Hgorg) was transferred to a sample boat,\nwhich was placed in a decomposition tube where\nit was dried and then thermally decomposed by\ncontrolled heating. The final decomposition products\npass thought a mercury amalgamator which collects\nHg0. The mercury amalgamator is heated to 700 ?C\nand the mercury is released and detected at 254 nm\nby absorption spectrometry. An external calibration\ncurve was made with standard solutions prepared\nby dilution from a 1000 mg l?1 mercuric nitrate\nstandard solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).\nThe mercury concentration was within the range\n5 \u2013 400 \u00b5g L?1.\n\nThe energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spec-\ntrometer (EDXRF) used in this work to quantify\nselenium consists of an X-ray tube (Philips, PW\n1140; 100 kV, 80 mA; Eindhoven, The Netherlands)\nequipped with a changeable secondary target, in\nmolybdenum. The characteristic radiation emitted by\nthe elements present in the sample was detected by\na Si(Li) detector (Oxford, High Wycombe, United\nKingdom), with a 30 mm2 active area and 8 \u00b5m beryl-\nlium window. The energy resolution was 135 eV at\n5.9 keV and the acquisition system was a Nucleus\nPCA card (High Wycombe, United Kingdom). Quan-\ntitative calculations were made by the fundamental\n\n2544 J Sci Food Agric 88:2543 \u2013 2550 (2008)\nDOI: 10.1002/jsfa\n\n\n\nMercury, selenium and ?-tocopherol in fish\n\nparameters method,19,20 which makes use of the\nfundamental parameters such as cross-sections for\nabsorption and X-ray production, transition inten-\nsities, fluorescence yields, for example. The relation\nbetween the measured peak intensity (Ii ) and the con-\ncentration of an element Ci is given by the relation\nIi = I0mKi Ci Ai , where I0 is the intensity of the X-ray\nbeam, m is the sample thickness (g cm?2), K is an\nexperimental calibration factor which depends on the\nspectrometer geometry, detector efficiency, detector\nsolid angle and cross-sections for producing charac-\nteristic X-rays, and together with I0 is obtained by\nanalysis of standard reference samples. The standard\nreference materials used were similar to the samples\nstudied: TORT-2, lobster hepatopancreas reference\nmaterial; DORM-2, dogfish muscle certified reference\nmaterial, both from National Research Council (NRC-\nCNRC), Canada, and freeze dried animal blood from\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA-A-13),\nAustria.\n\nAi is the self-attenuation factor which can be\nobtained iteratively, considering that 80% of the\nmatrix elements consist on H, C and O.\n\nThe peak shape and background are described by a\nmathematical Gaussian function. At the low-energy\nside of the peak, this function is replaced by an\nexponential function. The basic idea of the fitting\nprocedure is to find a set of parameter values which\nminimise the chi-square value.\n\nThe X-ray generator was operated at 50 kV and\n20 mA and a typical acquisition time of 1000 s was\nused. The sample powder was pressed into pellets\n2.0 cm in diameter without any chemical treatment.\nPellets were then glued onto Mylar film, on a sample\nholder, and placed directly in the X-ray beam, for\ndetermination of elements.\n\nAnalysis of ?-tocopherol was carried out after lipid\nextraction following the Bligh and Dyer method.21\n\nTocopherols were determined by normal phase high-\nperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) follow-\ning the method described by Piironen et al.22 with\nminor modifications. Total lipids were dissolved in\n\nhexane in the concentration of 36 mg lipid mL?1\n\nand 20 \u00b5L were injected in the HPLC (Jasco model\nPU-980; Tokyo, Japan), equipped with an auto-\nmatic injector Jasco (model AS-950-10), and a flu-\norescence detector (Jasco model FP-1520) (exci-\ntation wavelength = 292 nm, emission wavelength =\n324 nm), the mobile phase was degassed (Gastor\nmodel GT-104; Tokyo, Japan). The column was a\nLichrosorb Si 60-5 (250 mm \u00d7 3 mm i.d.; Chrompack,\nWalnut Creek, CA), protected with a guard column\n(S2)-SS (10 mm \u00d7 2 mm i.d., Chrompack). The iso-\ncratic mobile phase contained 7 mL L?1 of isopropanol\nin n-hexane, with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min?1. The\nretention time for the identification of ?-tocopherol\nwas determined by injection of an ?-tocopherol stan-\ndard. Tocopherols concentration was obtained using\nthe peak integration area of Borwin software 1.2 ver-\nsion (Tokyo, Japan).\n\nAn external calibration curve was made with\nstandard solutions prepared by dilution from a 95%\n?-tocopherol standard solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO,\nUSA). The range of ?-tocopherol concentration was\nwithin 1 \u2013 200 \u00b5g mL?1.\n\nA minimum of two replicate analyses was performed\nfor each sample and each element analysed. All\nstandards and reagents were of the highest purity.\nTo quantify HgT and HgOrg, and ?-tocopherol in\nthe sample a calibration curve was made with no\nfewer than five standards in different concentrations.\nThe moisture was determined by the sample drying\ntechnique at 105 ?C23 to convert the results of HgOrg\nand Se on a wet weight base. Data for ?-tocopherol\nwere transformed to mg kg?1 wet weight taking into\naccount the level of extract oil from the samples by\ngram of fresh tissue.\n\nAccuracy was checked by analysis of several certified\nreference materials (Table 1). From these results it\ncan be concluded that the analysed material was in the\nrange values of the certified material. The detection\nlimits were 0.5 \u00b5g g?1 (total and organic mercury),\n0.6 mg kg?1 dry weight (Se) and 2.59 \u00b5g mL?1 (?-\ntocopherol).\n\nTable 1.

All fish sampled were adults and their\nsizes were within the commercial range. Contrary to\nthe behaviour in Aphanopus carbo and Lepidorhombus\nspp., Lophius species and Helicolenus dactylopterus\nshowed significant differences between males and\nfemales either with length or weight (P &lt;0.05).\nIn all fish species studied a significantly positive\ncorrelation between length and weight (P &lt;0.001)\nwas verified. The correlation coefficients obtained\nwere: r = 0.9651 for Lophius spp.; r = 0.9517 for\nHelicolenus dactylopterus; r = 0.7923 for Aphanopus\ncarbo; and r = 0.9806 for Lepidorhombus spp.\n\nLevels of total and organic mercury, selenium and\n?-tocopherol and the corresponding mean, standard\ndeviations, median, range measured in muscle and\nliver tissues are summarised in Table 3.\n\nConsidering all fish species, the range of HgT\nin the muscle and liver tissue were, respectively,\n0.06 \u2013 1.75 and 0.04 \u2013 3.96 mg kg?1 wet weight. The\nHgT content, either in muscle or liver tissue, was not\ndifferent (P > 0.05) between males and females for\nevery species studied. This fact was also noted by\nMonteiro et al.24 for Helicolenus dactylopterus caught in\nthe sea around the Azores.\n\nTable 2.

However, this different mean level may be due\nnot only to the geographic capture zone, but also\nto the range size of the specimens analysed in these\nworks (range size: 13.8 \u2013 29.6 cm noted by Andersen\nand Depledge,25 11.2 \u2013 47.2 cm noted by Monteiro\net al.24 and 21.2 \u2013 36.0 cm in the present work). It\nis recognised that, in fish, mercury usually increases\nwith body size and/or age, so larger and/or older\nfish generally have higher concentrations than do\nsmaller or younger fish. For Helicolenus dactylopterus,\na significant positive correlation (P &lt;0.05) with\nHgT in the muscle tissue and both length and\nweight was found (Table 4). This finding has also\nbeen verified by other authors.24,25 According to\nthe Von Bertalanffy growth model for combined\nsexes of Helicolenus dactylopterus, found by Monteiro\net al.,24 the sampled fish used in the present study\nwas between 5 and 20 years old. In addition, the\nsame work reported that, during the first 20 years\nof age, the period of exponential growth, there\nis a significant increase in the mass of mercury\naccumulated each year in the muscle tissue. After\nage 20, the inflection and decrease in growth rate is\naccompanied by an exponential increase in mercury\naccumulation. The same author24 also verified that\nafter age 20 the annual increase in mercury is\napproximately constant. It was also revealed that\nhigher levels of mercury, when compared with that\nin other species, could be due to its slower growth\nand greater longevity, resulting in longer exposure to\ncontamination.\n\nThe mean percentage of HgOrg in the muscle\nof Helicolenus dactylopterus was 86 \u00b1 6%. Similar\nmean percentage (85.9%) for the same tissue\nand fish species was obtained by Andersen and\nDeplege.25\n\nAphanopus carbo is a deep-water species, living\nup to a maximum of 12 years26 and is considered\na large carnivorous predator.27 The mean total\nmercury concentration in the muscle for this species\n(0.63 \u00b1 0.27 mg kg?1 wet weight) was lower than the\nvalues reported by other authors. The study by Afonso\net al.28 exhibited mean levels near 0.9 mg kg?1 wet\nweight in Aphanopus carbo caught off both Madeira and\nthe Azores archipelagos. Nevertheless, in that study\nthe maximum level found in the areas of sampling\nwas lower (around 1.4 mg kg?1 wet weight) when\ncompared with the specimens sampled in Sesimbra\n(off the Portuguese mainland) of the present study\n(maximum was 1.75 mg kg?1 wet weight). Renzoni\net al.29 reported a HgT maximum concentration in\nAphanopus carbo caught in the Madeira archipelago,\nnear to those verified in the present study (1.8 mg kg?1\n\nwet weight).

Bebianno et al.30 noted\nthat total mercury increased exponentially with size\n(total length, cm) in the muscle and liver and the\npattern of mercury was similar between tissues. A\npositive correlation between both mercury levels in\nthe muscle and liver was also verified (r = 0.592,\nP &lt;0.0001).\n\nLophius species are voracious predators that feed\non a wide variety of small and juvenile fish32 and\ncan live up to age 20.33 By referring to the results\nobtained by Landa et al.33 in a study concerning the\ngrowth of Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa, the\nfish used in the present work was more than 4 years\nof age. Lepidorhombus is a visual day feeder, which\nfeeds on prey such as fish that move quickly, although\nthe smaller specimens are more dependent on smaller\nprey such as crustaceans.34 Both Lepidorhombus boscii35\n\nand L. whiffiagonis36 live up age 10. Storelli and\nMarcotrigiano32 identified the concentrations of total\nmercury in Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa and\nin Lepidorhombus boscii. Such concentrations showed a\nhigher maximum in the Lophius species (2.22 mg kg?1\n\nwet weight for L. piscatorius and 1.62 mg kg?1 wet\nweight for L. budegassa) and a lower maximum in\nLepidorhombus boscii (0.92 mg kg?1 wet weight) when\ncompared to the maximum level obtained in the\npresent work (1.51 mg kg?1 wet weight for Lophius\nspp. and 1.22 mg kg?1 wet weight for Lepidorhombus\nspp.). This difference may be due to the different\ngeographical zone (the samples were from the southern\nAdriatic sea along the Apulian coast) and in the\ncase of Lepidorhombus boscii also due to the lower\nweight of the samples (maximum weight was 225.8 g)\nwhen compared to the weight of the Lepidorhombus\nspp. in the present study (maximum weight was\n788 g). In contrast to the result verified in Aphanopus\ncarbo, the mean concentration of HgT in the muscle\nof Lophius spp. (0.43 \u00b1 0.32 mg kg?1 wet weight)\nwas higher than in liver (0.21 \u00b1 0.16 mg kg?1 wet\nweight). So the liver:muscle ratio is&lt;1. This may\noccur when mercury is no longer taken up, the\nliver concentration decreases and muscle level after\nsome time may exceed the liver level. Nevertheless,\n\nthis ratio is a somewhat problematic parameter\nbecause chronically contaminated fish can also show\na liver:muscle ratio&lt;1.31 The mean percentage of\nHgOrg for Lophius species was 84 \u00b1 6% and 75 \u00b1 8%,\nrespectively, for muscle and liver. This percentage\nwas 87 \u00b1 7% in the muscle of Lepidorhombus spp.\nExcept for muscle of Lophius spp., HgT had\na significant positive correlation with length and\nweight in both tissues (muscle and liver) species.\nPellegrini and Barghigiani34 and Barghigiani et al.37\n\nalso found a positive correlation between mercury\nlevels and weight in the muscle of Lepidorhombus\nboscii. Storelli and Marcotrigiano32 found in Lophius\npiscatorius and L. budegassa a mercury increase with\nlength.\n\nThe mean concentrations of selenium were quite\nconstant and for all species the range in the muscle\ntissue was between 0.21 and 0.90 mg kg?1 wet weight.\nSimilar values were described by other authors.10,38\n\nThe greatest levels were found in the liver of the\nLophius spp. (range 0.71 \u2013 2.69 mg kg?1 wet weight)\nand Aphanopus carbo (range 2.77 \u2013 5.78 mg kg?1 wet\nweight). Aphanopus carbo weight was positively\ncorrelated with levels of selenium in the muscle (P&lt;\n0.01) and liver (P &lt;0.0001). Mean contents of ?-\ntocopherol ranged from 1.1 to 15.9 mg kg?1 wet weight\nin Lophius spp. and Aphanopus carbo, respectively.\nSimilar contents of ?-tocopherol in marine fish flesh\nwere reported by other authors.13,39 The best source\nof ?-tocopherol was Aphanopus carbo, reaching a\nmaximum of 70.3 mg kg?1 wet weight. Nevertheless,\nfish flesh contains low to modest amounts of vitamin E\nwhen compared with other products.13 ?-Tocopherol\nshowed a significant positive correlation (P &lt;0.05)\nwith Lepidorhombus spp. length and Lophius spp.\nweight. No statistical significant differences (P >\n0.05) between sex and the analysed levels of the\ntwo antioxidants (selenium and ?-tocopherol) were\nverified.\n\nNo significant correlations were found between\nHgT and selenium or ?-tocopherol in the muscle\nof any studied species. This fact was also verified\nby Barghigiani et al.37 and Plessi et al.40 among levels\nof mercury and selenium evaluated in Lepidorhombus\nboscii, Lophius piscatorius and in several other fish\nspecies. However, in liver a significant negative\ncorrelation was found between selenium and the\npercentage of HgOrg (r = ?0.823; P &lt;0.01).\n\nThe molar ratio Se:Hg in the muscle was similar\namong species and varied from 1.7 (Helicolenus\ndactylopterus) to 3.7 (Lophius spp.). Similar ratios were\npresented by other authors.25,38,40 This ratio in the\nliver tissue was 21.4 for Lophius spp. and 26.8 in\nAphanopus carbo. So, the selenium concentration is\nhigher than mercury in both tissues on a molar basis.\nThe ratio 1:1 among selenium and mercury in liver\nand other tissues has been described.5\n\nNo significant correlation was obtained between\nselenium and ?-tocopherol in the muscle, but the\ntrend was negative. According to De Silva and\n\n2548 J Sci Food Agric 88:2543 \u2013 2550 (2008)\nDOI: 10.1002/jsfa\n\n\n\nMercury, selenium and ?-tocopherol in fish\n\nAndersen41 the vitamin E requirements are greater\nin selenium-depleted fish, which is in agreement with\nthe results obtained here.\n\nThe species studied are considered deep-water,\nlong-lived (more than 5 years) and the higher trophic\nlevel position may also contribute for the accumulation\nof contaminant metals in their tissues. The efficient\naccumulation of organic mercury in the muscle tissue\n(nearly 90%) and its lack of elimination, results in an\nincreasing mercury concentration with both age and\ntrophic level in the marine grazing food-chain.31 This\nfact may explain the higher level of organic mercury\nin the muscle tissue of the studied species (organic\nmercury mean percentage above 84%).\n\nDifferent organisms can bioaccumulate mercury\nat varying concentrations and eventually to harmful\nlevels, when their normal parameters are exceeded,\nthus exposing the human population who consume\nseafood to a potential danger.32 According to a\nEuropean Commission regulation15 the limit fixed for\nthis metal in the species studied is 1.0 mg kg?1 wet\nweight with the exception of Helicolenus dactylopterus,\nwhich t have a maximum allowed level of 0.50 mg kg?1\n\nwet weight. Taking this into account, around\n6% of Lophius spp. and Aphanopus carbo, 2%\nof Lepidorhombus spp. and 70% of Helicolenus\ndactylopterus have concentrations of total mercury\nabove the limit established by the EU regulation.\n\nThe Joint Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the United Nations/World Health Organization\n(FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Addi-\ntives (JECFA) recommends a provisional tolerable\nweekly intake (PTWI) of 5 \u00b5g kg?1 body weight\nfor total mercury16 and 1.6 \u00b5g kg?1 body weight\nfor methylmercury.17 For the antioxidants, adequate\nintakes of 30 \u2013 70 \u00b5g Se day?1 and around 14 mg vita-\nmin E day?1 have been estimated for adults.11\n\nPortugal is one of the European countries that has\nthe highest annual per capita fish consumption, around\n57.1 kg,42 which represents 156 g fish person?1 day?1.\nIn addition, it should be noted that the consumption\nis based on a high number of species. The estimated\ndaily intake (\u00b5g kg?1 body weight) for each fish\nspecies studied was calculated based on the mean\nlevels obtained for total and organic mercury, and\nconsidering an adult of 60 kg and the daily Portuguese\nconsumption of fish per capita (Table 5). Taking these\nresults into consideration, landings, import \u2013 export\nbalance and the Portuguese population and taking\naccount of the PTWI established by WHO,16,17\n\nthe fish species studied have to be consumed in\nmoderation, desirably not more than once a week.\nSo, these results lead to the conclusion that mercury\nintake is a problem which justifies more attention.\nOn the other hand, in contrast to ?-tocopherol,\nwhich only provides a small contribution to the\ndaily need, the muscle of the fishes studied is a\ngood source of selenium and could largely supply\nthe requirement.\n\nTable 5.

Cadmium levels decreased \nin the order liver>gonad>muscle and pb levels decreased in the order gonad>liver>muscle. according to the eu limits, the \nconcentration observed in some specimens, particularly those of tHg, raises some food safety concerns. in all the tissues \nthe concentrations of each toxic metal differed between locations. in particular: i) tHg concentrations in specimens from \nMadeira were significantly higher than those from the azores and the mainland; ii) Cd levels in specimens from the mainland \nwere significantly higher than those from Madeira and the azores; and iii) for all analysed tissues pb levels were signifi-\ncantly higher in specimens from the azores than in those from the mainland. the differences in toxic metal levels between \nlocations were further discussed in relation to aspects of species dynamics and the influence of the main environmental \nfeatures at each location.\n\nKeywords: total mercury, cadmium, lead, muscle, gonad, liver, Aphanopus carbo, northeast atlantic.\n\nresuMen: Mercurio, cadmio y plomo en el sable negro (AphAnopus cArbo Lowe, 1839) de Portugal Continental \ny de los Archipi\u00e9lagos de Madeira y Azores. \u2013 se investigaron las concentraciones de mercurio total (tHg), cadmio \n(Cd) y plomo (pb) en m\u00fasculo, h\u00edgado y g\u00f3nada de sable negro en muestras recogidas en tres regiones del sur del atl\u00e1ntico \nnoreste: portugal continental y archipi\u00e9lagos de Madeira y azores. se puso especial \u00e9nfasis en la comparaci\u00f3n entre regio-\nnes. tambi\u00e9n fueron analizados los factores talla, sexo y madurez sexual. una tendencia decreciente fue observada en las \nconcentraciones medias (mg/kg ww) de tHg entre h\u00edgado, m\u00fasculo y g\u00f3nadas. los niveles de Cd decrecieron entre h\u00edgado, \ng\u00f3nadas y m\u00fasculo, y en caso de los niveles de pb, decrecieron entre g\u00f3nadas, h\u00edgado y m\u00fasculo. de acuerdo con las regula-\nciones de la ue sobre el consumo de esta especie, las concentraciones observadas en algunos espec\u00edmenes, particularmente \nde tHg, han suscitado inquietudes relacionadas con la seguridad alimentaria. el factor regi\u00f3n fue significativo en las dife-\nrencias entre los tres metales para todos los tejidos. particularmente: i) la concentraci\u00f3n de tHg en espec\u00edmenes de Madeira \nfue significativamente m\u00e1s alta que en azores y en el continente; ii) los niveles de Cd en espec\u00edmenes del Continente fueron \n\nScientia Marina 73s2\ndecember 2009, 77-88, barcelona (spain)\n\nissn: 0214-8358\ndoi: 10.3989/scimar.2009.73s2077\n\nstoCk struCture and qualitY oF \nblaCk sCabbardFisH in tHe soutHern  \nne atlantiC\nL.S.

Mercury is a highly toxic metal that \noccurs naturally in the environment as a result of \nmetal volatilisation associated with volcanic events \nor cinnabar deposits (mercuric sulphide, Hgs). \nthe anthropogenic contribution to environmental \nmercury is derived from metal extraction (e.g. gold \nmining) and from its direct or indirect industrial \nuses. unlike cadmium and lead, inorganic mercury \ncan be methylated and form organic mercury com-\npounds covalently bound to carbon, such as meth-\nylmercury (CH3Hg), which is one of its most toxic \nforms (Hrudey et al., 1996). in addition, mercury is \nthe only known metal that consistently biomagnifies \nthrough the food chain, i.e. predators accumulate \nhigher mercury concentrations than those found in \ntheir prey (Monteiro et al., 1996). Cadmium is a sta-\nble, ubiquitous toxic metal that is not abundant in its \npure state in the environment. it is a by-product of \nzinc, lead, and copper mining and smelting that en-\nters the organism through the diet and is concentrat-\ned mostly in the kidneys and the liver (epa, 1999). \nFossil fuel combustion is the major source of pollut-\nant lead in the atmosphere. later it enters the marine \nenvironment through the atmospheric deposition by \nthe wet and dry removal process (paterson, 1987). \nlead can accumulate in the bone, affect the central \nnervous system and interfere with the metabolism of \nhemoglobin. living organisms tend to bioaccumu-\nlate mercury, cadmium and lead since they absorb \nthe toxic substances at a greater rate than they are \nmetabolised or excreted. as a result, bioaccumula-\ntion of toxic metals poses a serious threat to animal \nhealth, including that of humans.\n\nthe growing concerns about the presence of \ntoxic metals in food led the european Commission \nto establish legal limits for several chemical contam-\ninants. For black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), \nmaximum permissible levels of mercury, cadmium \nand lead are 1.0 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg and 0.30 mg/kg, \nrespectively (eu 2006, 2008).\n\nthe black scabbardfish (family trichuridae) is \na top predator that inhabits the ne atlantic slopes \naround isolated island groups and seamounts be-\ntween 200 and 1600 m in depth (parin, 1986; Mar-\ntins and Ferreira, 1995). Juveniles are mesopelagic \nand adults are benthopelagic, migrating to midwater \nat night to feed on fish, squid and crustaceans (Mer-\nrett and Haedrich, 1997). this species is appreciated \nby fish consumers in portugal, especially in the Ma-\ndeira archipelago. \n\nthe aim of this study was to characterise the lev-\nels of mercury, cadmium and lead in muscle, gonad \nand liver of black scabbardfish caught off three dif-\nferent portuguese regions (the mainland, the azores \nand Madeira). Factors such as region, length, sex, \nand maturity stage that can influence the variabil-\nity of metal concentrations in black scabbardfish in \nthose three tissues were also investigated. lastly, \nmetal levels obtained in tissues were compared with \nestablished limits defined by the european Commu-\nnity regulation (2006, 2008). \n\nMaterials and MetHods \n\nblack scabbardfish samples were obtained on a \nroutine monthly basis at the landing ports of ses-\nimbra (mainland portugal) and Funchal (Madeira). \nthey were obtained on an irregular basis at santa \nMaria (the azores) (Fig. 1), since there is no fish-\nery targeting the species in this archipelago. For the \npurpose of this study, samples were collected in Feb-\nruary-March, June-July and october-november (the \nspawning period in Madeiran waters, Figueiredo et \nal., 2003) from May 2005 to december 2007 but, \ndue to problems involving sampling dispatch, it was \nonly possible to sample two seasons in the azores \nand Madeira. For each individual, total length (mm), \ntotal weight (g) and sex were recorded.

(2000). \nthe otoliths were removed and age was assessed by \ncounting annuli in sectioned otoliths (Vieira et al., \n2009). samples of dorsal muscle (post-opercular \nregion), gonad and liver were collected (\u00b110 g), \nstored in a plastic bag and preserved at -20\u00baC. the \nfrozen samples were sent to two laboratories (dop-\niMar, ua\u00e7 and inrb, ip/l-ipiMar) for mercury, \nand cadmium and lead analysis, respectively. the \nnumber of samples analysed by each laboratory was \ndifferent because the procedure for cadmium and lead \nanalysis uses much more material than the method \nfor tHg analysis. prior to the analysis, samples were \ndefrosted at room temperature and homogenised in a \nfood blender. all laboratory ware was cleaned with \nHno3 (10%) for 48 h and rinsed with ultrapure wa-\nter (18.2 M? cm) to avoid contamination. Chemical \nreagents were pro-analysis or superior. Mercury, \ncadmium and lead concentrations were reported as \nmilligrams per kilogram on a wet weight basis (mg/\nkg ww). all analyses were carried out at least in du-\nplicate; an external calibration method was used for \nquantitative analysis. \n\nTotal mercury analysis\n\ntotal mercury (tHg) was determined by cold \nvapour atomic absorption spectrophotometry \n(CVaas) according to the procedures described by \nHatch and ott, (1968). tissue sub-samples (0.2-1 g \nww) were subjected to a wet mineralisation by di-\ngestion in sulphuric acid and subsequently oxidised \nto Hg2+, using potassium permanganate. Mercury \nquantification was performed with a bacharach \nColeman Model 50d Mercury analyser system. \n\nthe Hg2+ was reduced to Hg0 by adding stannous \nchloride.  the volatile Hg0 was bubbled into the \nclosed system of the analyser and the absorption \nwas measured (wavelength at 253.7 nm). the de-\ntection limit (expressed in mg/kg ww) was 0.012. \ntotal mercury concentrations in the sample were \ndetermined in duplicate using an external calibra-\ntion. the linear calibration curve was obtained by \nmeasuring the absorbance of six standards, with \ndifferent concentrations, which were prepared \nby dilution from a 1000 mg l-1 mercuric chloride \nsolution (Merck, germany). analytical quality \ncontrol was provided through within- and between-\nlaboratory quality control procedures employed \nthroughout the study period. the accuracy of the \nmethod (expressed as relative error) was within \n10%, and was monitored throughout the analysis \nof the certified reference materials (dogfish mus-\ncle, dorM-2; dogfish liver, dolt-2) from the \nnational research Council of Canada, ottawa. the \nresults obtained in this study (4.49 \u00b1 0.25 mg/kg; \n2.14 \u00b1 0.16 mg/kg) were in the range of the certi-\nfied values (4.64 \u00b1 0.26 mg/kg and 2.14 \u00b1 0.28 mg/\nkg) for dorM-2 and dolt-2, respectively. the \nprecision (or reproducibility) of the method (ex-\npressed as the coefficient of variation of duplicates \nwithin and between batches) was within the usual \n10% for total mercury determinations in biological \nsamples (saltzman et al., 1983). interference with \nsensitivity due to matrix and pre-treatment were as-\nsessed by the method of standard additions before \nthe wet mineralisation digestion, and the average \nrecoveries of added inorganic mercury was 96.8% \n(s.d. =11.3, n=12). \n\nCadmium and lead analysis\n\ndetermination of cadmium and lead levels was \nperformed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry \n(Faas), according to the procedures described by \nJorhem (2000). edible portion samples (10 g) were \ndry-ashed at 500\u00baC through a gradual temperature \nincrease. ash was dissolved in concentrated nitric \nacid and the solution obtained was evaporated to \ndryness. the final residue was dissolved once again \nwith 5 ml nitric acid 15% (v/v) and transferred to \n10-ml volumetric flasks, and final volumes were ad-\njusted with ultrapure water. quantification of these \nelements was performed using a spectr aa-20 Var-\nian spectrophotometer with deuterium background \ncorrection (l = 228.8 nm for Cd and l = 217.0 nm \n\nFig. 1. \u2013 Map of the southern northeast atlantic with the sampling \nlocations of black scabbardfish and the 1000 m isobath. aa, azores \narchipelago; FC, Funchal; Ma, Madeira archipelago; pC, pico is-\nland; sM, santa Maria island; sZ, sesimbra (mainland portugal).\n\n\n\n80 \u2022 V.

Maturity stages (Ms) were not all \nfound at each of the three locations, and in particular \nno mature individuals were observed off mainland \nportugal (lack of Ms iV and V).\n\nMercury\n\nConcentrations of total mercury differed be-\ntween tissues: they were highest in the liver, and \ndecreased from muscle to gonad (table 1). the \nadjusted glM (table 3) showed that the factors re-\ngion, maturity stage and covariate length explained \na fairly high percentage of the variance in mercury \nconcentrations in liver (r2 = 0.30) and muscle (r2 \n= 0.59). For gonad this variance was lower (r2 \n\n=0.19). total mercury levels were significantly \ndifferent between regions and maturity stages \n(p<0.001 in both cases) for all tissues. length was \nalso significant for all tissues (p<0.001). the levels \nof total mercury differed between sexes in liver and \nmuscle (p<0.001 for both), but no differences were \nobserved in gonad (p= 0.93).\n\nFor the three tissues, the highest total mercury \nlevels were registered off Madeira and the lowest \noff the mainland (Fig. 2a). the total mercury levels \nin liver (maximum of 50.23 mg/kg ww recorded \nin one specimen from Madeira) were commonly \nmuch higher than those in the other two tissues (ta-\nble 1). total mercury in gonad showed the lowest \n\nlevels, with a minimum (0.03 mg/kg) and a maxi-\nmum (2.74 mg/kg) in specimens from the azores. \naccordingly, the levels registered for the muscle \nwere higher, respectively 1.45, 0.71 and 0.69 mg/\nkg ww for Madeira, the azores and the mainland \n(table 1). the lsd test indicated that total mercu-\nry means in muscle from specimens caught off the \nazores and the mainland were significantly lower \n(p<0.001) than those from specimens caught off \nMadeira (table 4). in gonad and liver, means were \nnot statistically different between the mainland and \nthe azores. For muscle and liver the differences \nbetween Madeira and the mainland and between \nMadeira and the azores were statistically signifi-\ncant (p<0.001; table 4). the mean total mercury \nlevels in muscle and liver were significantly higher \n(p<0.001) in females than in males (Fig. 2b, table \n3). although males showed higher mean mercury \nconcentrations in gonad than females, this differ-\nence was not statistically significant (Fig. 2b; table \n3). total mercury levels increased from maturity \nstage i to maturity stage iV and decreased in the \npost-spawning stage (Ms V; Fig. 2c). the highest \nvariability of total mercury levels was registered \nfor maturity stage ii (Fig. 2c).\n\nCadmium \n\nin all three regions the cadmium concentration \nwas higher in liver tissue than in gonad or muscle \n(table 2 and Fig. 3a). the highest cadmium con-\ncentration was found in liver of fish caught off the \nmainland (30.24 mg/kg ww) and the lowest (below \n0.02 mg/kg ww) in muscle from specimens of all \nthree regions. the cadmium concentration in go-\nnads ranged from 0.03 (Madeira) to 1.30 mg/kg ww \n(mainland).\n\nTable 3. \u2013 significance of p-values for each factor considered in linear models adjusted to total mercury, cadmium and lead levels in gonad, \nliver and muscle.\n\nMetal tissue r2 region sex Maturity stage length\n\ntotal mercury gonad 0.19&lt;0.001 ns&lt;0.001&lt;0.001 \n liver 0.3&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001 \n Muscle 0.59&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001&lt;0.001\n \nCadmium gonad 0.27&lt;0.05 ns&lt;0.05 ns \n liver 0.19&lt;0.01 ns ns ns \n Muscle 0.1&lt;0.001 ns ns ns\n \nlead gonad 0.36&lt;0.001 ns ns ns \n liver 0.19&lt;0.05 ns ns ns \n Muscle 0.08&lt;0.01 ns ns ns\n\nns = not significant (p>0.05)\n\n\n\n82 \u2022 V.

For all the tissues, \nthe adjusted glM (table 3) revealed that region \nwas a significant factor in explaining concentration \ndifferences in muscle (p<0.001), liver (p<0.01) and \ngonad (p<0.05). the maturity stage was only sig-\nnificant in the case of gonad (p<0.05). the pairwise \ncomparison indicated that cadmium mean concen-\ntrations in muscle and liver differed significantly \n(p<0.001) between the azores and the mainland \n(table 4). For gonad tissue, significant differences \n(p<0.01) were found only between Madeira and the \nmainland.\n\nMale gonad showed higher median cadmium \nlevels than female gonad, but the difference was not \nstatistically significant (p>0.05) (Fig. 3b, table 3). \ndifferences between maturity stages were detected for \ngonad (p<0.05, table 3). Maturity stages iii and iV \nshowed the lowest median levels and in the remaining \nstages median values were similar (Fig. 3c).\n\nLead\n\nin general, lead showed a decreasing gradient \nfrom gonad to liver and lastly to muscle (table 2). \nthe region was the only factor that explained the \nvariance in lead concentrations for all analysed tis-\nsues (liver, r2 =0.19; muscle, r2 = 0.08 and gonad, \nr2 =0.36) (table 3), of which the median lead levels \nwere highest for the azores (table 2). the maxi-\nmum concentration (1.15 mg/kg ww) was observed \nin the gonad of a specimen from the azores and the \nminimum (<0.01 mg/kg ww) in the liver of speci-\nmens from Madeira and the mainland. the median \nconcentrations in muscle were similar within all the \nregions (0.04-0.05 mg/kg ww; table 2). the pair-\nwise comparisons (table 4) showed that lead levels \nin liver and gonad differed significantly between \nMadeira and the azores (p<0.05 and p<0.001, re-\nspectively). the mainland and the azores differed \nfrom each other in terms of concentrations in all three \ntissues (p<0.001 for gonad and muscle; p<0.05 for \nliver; table 4). lead levels in all three tissues did not \ndiffer between sexes (Fig. 4b). in liver, the ranges of \nlead levels for the first three maturity stages (i, ii and \niii) were fairly wide, exhibiting a decreasing trend \nfrom stage i to iV.

Moreover, our results were within a \nsimilar range to those obtained for other deep-water \nspecies captured off the azores (Magalh\u00e3es et al., \n2007) and mainland portugal (afonso et al., 2008), \n\nand for hydrothermal vent fish species at the Mid-\natlantic ridge (Martins et al., 2006).\n\ntotal mercury levels observed in black scabbard-\nfish caught off the azores and Madeira were sig-\nnificantly higher than those caught off the mainland. \npotential sources of mercury are the volcanism asso-\nciated with the expansion of the Mid-atlantic ridge \nand the occurrence of mercury-enriched Mediterra-\nnean water, which flows into the north atlantic at \ndepths below 1000 m (Johnson and stevens, 2000). \nHowever, the greatest source of mercury seems to be \nthe atmospheric deposition of elemental mercury as-\nsociated with the global cycle by way of long-range \ntransport (Monteiro et al., 1996).\n\nWhile little is known about trace metal com-\nposition of water masses in the northeast atlantic, \nthese archipelagos are also characterised by highly \ndynamic oceanographic, atmospheric and geologi-\ncal processes, namely the north atlantic gyre, the \nazores front, the upwelling off the iberian penin-\nsula and the Canary islands current (pollard and \npu, 1985), which can contribute to the dispersal and \nconcentration of pollutants in these areas. \n\nthe higher total mercury levels found in speci-\nmens from Madeira in comparison with those from \nthe azores might be related to the size of the speci-\nmens analysed. the length of specimens from Ma-\ndeira was greater (total length >1150 mm) than that \nof specimens from the azores, and a higher percent-\nage of females (93%) was observed in Madeira indi-\nviduals. Mercury concentrations in tissues increased \nwith fish length (data not shown), so the larger \n(older) fish showed higher concentrations than the \nsmaller (young) ones. Females showed higher mer-\ncury concentrations than males, a result that can be \nrelated to differences in growth rates between sexes \n(Vieira et al., 2009). as mercury accumulation is \n\nTable 4. \u2013 Multiple comparisons between total mercury, cadmium and lead estimated marginal means by region for each tissue (mean differ-\nence; standard error; significance of p-value).\n\nMetal tissue azores vs Madeira azores vs Mainland Madeira vs Mainland\n\ntotal mercury gonad -0.15; 0.05 (***) 0.02; 0.04 (ns) 0.17; 0.06 (**)\n liver -3.81; 0.90 (***) 0.41; 0.72 (ns) 4.22; 1.09 (***)\n Muscle -0.32; 0.05 (***) -0.11; 0.04 (**) 0.21; 0.07 (***)\n\nCadmium gonad 0.00; 0.11 (ns) -0.20; 0.12 (ns) -0.20; 0.07 (**)\n liver -7.01; 2.81 (*) -5.79; 1.74 (***) 1.22; 2.65 (ns) \n Muscle 0.00; 0.00 (ns) -0.01; 0.00 (***) -0.01; 0.00 (*)\n\nlead gonad 0.44; 0.09 (***) 0.37; 0.09 (***) -0.07; 0.06 (ns) \n liver 0.08; 0.04 (*) 0.05; 0.02 (*) -0.03; 0.03 (ns) \n Muscle 0.01; 0.01 (ns) 0.02; 0.00 (***) 0.00;0.01 (ns)\n\nsignificance (p-values): (ns) p ? 0.05; (*) p &lt;0.05; (**) p &lt;0.01; (***) p &lt;0.001\n\n\n\nMerCurY, CadMiuM and lead in A. cArbo \u2022 85\n\nsCi.

(2007). Cadmium contents \nwere significantly higher in liver and in muscle in \nmainland individuals than in azores individuals, and \nsignificantly higher in muscle and in gonads than in \nMadeiran individuals. these findings were expected \nbecause this metal is mostly derived from anthropo-\ngenic sources (e.g. metallurgical industries). \n\nlead concentrations in fish muscle are generally \nlower than in liver, a pattern that is also observed \nfor cadmium (Mormede and davies, 2001a). in the \npresent study, lead levels found in muscle samples \nfrom the three portuguese regions were of the same \nmagnitude as those reported by afonso et al. (2007) \nand Cronin et al. (1998). our results were also con-\nsistent with those observed by Mormede and dav-\nies (2001a) in several deep-water species caught off \nthe rockall trough (west scotland). in agreement \nwith afonso et al. (2007), we obtained higher lead \nlevels in the azorean than in the Madeiran speci-\nmens, but similar levels between Madeira and the \nmainland. Furthermore, it was observed that the \nmajority of lead levels in the muscle of specimens \ncollected off the mainland were below the detec-\n\ntion limit of this method (<0.01 mg/kg ww). the \nlead levels in gonads and liver were 3 times higher \nin azorean specimens than in those found in the \nother two regions. though the azores are distant \nfrom a known anthropogenic source of metal pol-\nlution, it is also conceivable that the input of lead \nmay originate from remote sources of industrial \npollution or from mineral dusts by way of \u201clong-\nrange atmospheric transport\u201d. Furthermore, arsenic \nand other elements such as lead originating in the \nnW african sahara have been found in material \ncollected from azorean \u201cdust-events\u201d (reis et al., \n2002), and may later settle down in the deep sea. \nin addition, hydrothermal activity associated with \nnearby shallow- and deep-vent waters can directly \ncontribute to this metal enrichment in deep-water \nspecies from this oceanic region (Wallenstein et \nal., 2009; Cosson et al., 2008). \n\nit is generally accepted that metal concentra-\ntions in the organism reflect the exposure in the \naquatic environment and the intake through diet \n(Mormede and davies, 2001a). a probable reason \nfor the highly significant region effect observed \nin this study might be the differences in the diet \nof black scabbardfish from these three geographic \nareas. studies on stomach contents of this species \nin the study region have so far been inconclusive, \nmainly due to the characteristics of the fishery. in \nlongline fisheries the specimens remain attached \nto the gear long enough for the stomach contents \nto be completely digested, resulting in a high rate \nof emptiness (93%) (Freitas,1998; anon, 2000). \nnevertheless, older published data have described \nthe existence of lower mesopelagic and upper bath-\nypelagic fish species (e.g. Maul,1961) and more \nrecently Freitas (1998) found crustacean species, \ncephalopods and fish from the meso- and bathype-\nlagic zones in the stomachs of A.carbo captured in \nMadeira waters. there is also evidence that black \nscabbardfish from the mainland feed on the crus-\ntacean Aristeus antennatus (i. Figueiredo, pers. \ncom.), so a preferred crustacean diet might explain \nthe higher cadmium concentrations found in main-\nland specimens than in speciments from the azores \nand Madeira, given the fact that crustaceans tend \nto accumulate cadmium, mainly in the hepatopan-\ncreas (atsdr, 2008). a cephalopod-based diet \ncould also contribute to the intake of toxic met-\nals in black scabbardfish since they also prey on \nthese invertebrates (nakamura and parin, 1993, \nMuus et al., 1998). in a recent study, louren\u00e7o \n\n\n\n86 \u2022 V. Costa et al.\n\nsCi. Mar., 73s2, december 2009, 77-88. issn 0214-8358 doi: 10.3989/scimar.2009.73s2077\n\net al. (2009) showed significant concentrations of \ncadmium (0.04\u20130.33 mg/kg ww), lead (0.02\u20130.09 \nmg/kg ww) and mercury (0.05\u20130.12 mg/kg ww) \nin three different species of cephalopods caught \noff the portuguese coast. the variability of metal \nconcentrations can be attributed to the availability \nof different prey (crustaceans, cephalopods and/or \nfishes) in the portuguese regions studied. However, \nwithout additional data on dietary composition, it is \nnot possible to explain these geographic differences \nbased only on the black scabbardfish diet.\n\nregarding the metals distribution in the differ-\nent tissues, it is recognised that the mechanisms \nby which fish regulate the accumulation of metals \nmay be linked to the metal absorption or elimina-\ntion processes, which in turn seem related to tissue \nand organ characteristics (reinfelder et al., 1998). \nblack scabbardfish has higher levels of mercury and \ncadmium in liver than in the other analysed tissues. \nthe high concentrations found in this organ can be \nexplained by the liver\u2019s ability to accumulate large \namounts of these metals, through the formation of a \nsoluble metal-binding protein, and by its important \nrole in storage, redistribution, detoxification, and \ntransformation of pollutants (evans et al., 1993; \nMormede and davies, 2001a,b). \n\nthe low concentrations of lead in liver and mus-\ncle have their origins in several mechanisms that are \ninvolved in this metal intake by fishes. remarkably, \nthere are no known specific metal-binding cytosolic \nproteins in the liver with high affinity for lead. \nthus, rather than being accumulated in the liver, \nthe absorbed lead is quickly distributed to other tis-\nsues (ga\u0161pi? et al., 2002) such as gonad tissues, as \nevidenced in this study. to our knowledge, this is \nthe first study that reports on levels of total mercury, \ncadmium and lead in gonad of black scabbardfish. \nthe inclusion of this organ in ecotoxicological stud-\nies allows a better understanding of metal distribu-\ntion throughout the fish\u2019s lifespan.\n\nWith regard to public health, muscle is the most \nimportant tissue used to estimate metal concentra-\ntions since it is mainly used for human consumption. \nHowever, the toxic metal content in liver and female \ngonad should still be an issue of concern because \nthese organs are also consumed in the Madeira ar-\nchipelago. the median concentrations of mercury \nfound in muscle of black scabbardfish from both \nthe mainland and the azores were below the limit \nestablished by the eu (1.0 mg kg-1 ww), whereas the \nmedian concentration in specimens from Madeira \n\nwere above this limit. For all the regions, the median \ntotal mercury concentrations were above 1.0 mg kg-1 \n\nww in liver and below this limit in gonads. Median \nlead concentrations were under the limit value (0.30 \nmg/kg ww) established by the eu (2006, 2008). the \nlimit of 0.05 mg/kg ww established by the eu (2006, \n2008) for cadmium was exceeded in both liver and \ngonads, but it was not reached in muscle in any of \nthe regions studied. \n\nin view of the high levels of mercury found and \nsome results observed for the other two metals, it \nis not safe to assume that this species may be con-\nsumed regularly and without restrictions. it is advis-\nable to perform a risk analysis in order to evaluate \nthe ptWi (provisional tolerable weekly intake) of \nblack scabbardfish in the overall diet of portuguese \nconsumers. \n\ntaken together, the presence of high mercury \nlevels in tissues from this benthopelagic species is \nexpected and is related not only to the biochemistry \nof this metal but also to the ecological and biological \ncharacteristics of the species. A.carbo lives at great \ndepths, occupies a high trophic level, is long-lived \nand is a predator subjected to longer burdens of this \ncontaminant during its lifetime as a consequence of \na diet rich in meso- and bathypelagic species.\n\nregarding cadmium and lead levels, the speci-\nmens landed on the mainland were significantly dif-\nferent from those landed in the azores. Cadmium \nconcentrations were higher in the mainland speci-\nmens, whereas lead concentrations were higher in \nthe azorean specimens. Contrary to the described \ndistribution pattern of mercury, the region is the \nonly factor that explains the observed variability of \ncadmium and lead levels. this may be related to the \nabsence of biomagnification of these metals. as for \ncadmium and lead levels, the differences between \nmaturity stages can be related to the energetic and \nchemical composition oscillations that occur during \nthe reproductive cycle of this species. \n\nin summary, the similarities and dissimilarities \nobserved between regions might be due to differ-\nences in trace metal contents in the water, species \nphysiology, and feeding preferences of the fish in-\nhabiting these three portuguese regions. in view of \nthe fact that the exploration of deep-sea fish stocks \nhas increased greatly, particularly in the north \natlantic, it is important to monitor the levels of \nmetals in abiotic and biotic compartments of these \nmarine ecosystems. extending our knowledge to the \nbiological cycle of A. carbo, including its feeding \n\n\n\nMerCurY, CadMiuM and lead in A. cArbo \u2022 87\n\nsCi.

Tail estimation (TE) estimator \n\nwas more accurate for lower probabilities, rendering accurate risk estimations different \n\nfrom zero. However, for higher probabilities, the much simpler plug-in (PI) estimator could \n\nbe applied. Additionally, the limitations of a deterministic approach were shown. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS: methylmercury, cuttlefish, octopus, squid, risk assessment, extreme value \n\ntheory \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nDuring the last decades, the health benefits of a diet rich in seafood have been extensively \n\nrecognized. In particular, ?3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (?3-PUFA) are associated with \n\ndecreased morbidity and mortality due to various diseases. Several epidemiological \n\nstudies\n(1)\n\n have found a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke and \n\nconsequent further effects due to the beneficial effects of these fatty acids on lipids \u2014\n\n\n\nnamely, cholesterol\u2014, blood pressure, eicosanoids and coagulation rate. For instance, the \n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) \n\nrecommend a regular fish consumption of 1-2 servings per week in order to provide an \n\nequivalent of 200-500 mg of the ?3-PUFA eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids.\n(2)\n\n \n\nHowever, seafood can also be a source of pernicious contaminants: PCBs, dioxins, residues \n\nof pesticides and contaminant metals. \n\nCephalopods, in particular, can be a source of contaminant metals, since they may \n\naccumulate these metals in their tissues.\n(3,4)\n\n A recent paper has found significant levels of \n\nvarious toxic metals in cephalopods, such as octopus or squid, caught in Portuguese \n\nwaters.\n(5)\n\n On the other hand, cephalopods are one of the most important seafood groups \n\ncaptured in Europe.\n(6)\n\n Concerning Portuguese consumers, cephalopods had a share of \n\napproximately 8 % of the wholesale market sales. Furthermore, these cephalopods \n\ncorrespond to an economic value (in terms of auction transaction) approximately three \n\ntimes more important, representing a quarter of the market.\n(7)\n\n \n\nAmong contaminant metals, mercury is not known to play any metabolic function and can \n\nbe very toxic to humans, even at very low concentrations.\n(8)\n\n WHO and FAO have \n\nestablished as provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) value 5 \u00b5g/kg for total \n\nmercury.\n(9)\n\n For methylmercury (methyl-Hg), a highly toxic organic compound of mercury, \n\ngiven its ready and easy absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, WHO and FAO reduced in \n\n2003 the PTWI from 3.3 (two thirds of the total mercury) to 1.6 \u00b5g/kg.\n(10)\n\n Therefore, a \n\nquantitative assessment of the methyl-Hg intake by populations eating large amounts of \n\ncephalopods as well by the general population should be carried out in order to have more \n\ninformation about the contribution of each species to a given methyl-Hg intake.\n(11)\n\n This \n\n\n\nconcern is even greater for the cephalopods consumption in Southern Europe and, \n\nparticularly, in Portugal, because these populations frequently consume cephalopods, \n\nmainly cuttlefish, octopus, and squid.\n(12)\n\n \n\nContaminant assessment can be performed by combining food consumption data or, in the \n\nabsence of this information, consumption estimates and plausible scenarios with \n\ncontaminant concentration levels, according to different approaches: deterministic or \n\nprobabilistic. In the former, a single \u2018worst case\u2019 point estimate of each input variable \n\n(consumption and contamination level) is used. In the latter, the variability of all input \n\nvariables can be accounted for by using appropriate probability distributions with \n\nappropriate parameters.\n(11)\n\n This approach is increasingly being used for the assessment of \n\ncontaminants in foods.\n(11,13,14)\n\n Its output is a probability distribution providing some insight \n\ninto the variability of the assessed intake in a population. Thus, in this way it is possible to \n\nestimate the probability that the individual exposure to a specific heavy metal exceeds the \n\nPTWI. In a large population, an accurate estimation of this quantity is very important since \n\neven a difference of 1 \u2030 involves a large number of individuals. However, the estimation \n\nof this probability highly depends on the tail behaviour of the distribution, since PTWI \n\nvalues are usually higher than most individual intakes. The main statistical tool for this is \n\nthe extreme value theory (EVT).\n(15)\n\n This tool has been used in very different areas, such as \n\nhydrology or finance.\n(16)\n\n In these areas, extreme values are of crucial importance. For \n\ncontamination and consumption data, extreme values are also very important, since risk \n\nmainly concerns highly polluted food or high consumptions. EVT properly addresses these \n\nextremes because it takes full account of the very high (or very low) observed values.\n(15)\n\n \n\nThe principle is to model the tail of an exposure distribution by a Pareto type distribution, \n\ncharacterized by a Pareto index, which can be interpreted as a risk index.\n(15)\n\n This index is \n\n\n\nestimated by the Hill estimator, which, in turn, shows a large instability, producing the so \n\ncalled \u2018Hill-horror plot\u2019.\n(16)\n\n This instability may be greatly improved by using bias \n\ncorrection techniques,\n(17,18)\n\n hence, ensuring the achievement of more reliable estimates of \n\nthe population at risk. \n\nTherefore, the main objective of this paper is to estimate the methyl-Hg intake through the \n\nconsumption of three cephalopod species, cuttlefish, octopus, and squid, in Portugal and, \n\nthus, to estimate the portion of a given population (whether the whole Portuguese \n\npopulation or sub-populations displaying specific consumption patterns) at risk. \n\n \n\n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.1. Raw Data \n\nThe individuals of the studied species, cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), squid (Loligo vulgaris), \n\nand octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were adults and were caught in Portuguese continental \n\nwaters with the purpose of ensuring a representative sampling of the cephalopod products \n\nmarketed in Portugal. The weight ranged between 540 and 3100 g (a sample size of 37 \n\nindividuals), 65 and 1200 g (26), 430 and 4900 g (43), for cuttlefish, squid, and octopus, \n\nrespectively. Total Hg content was determined by cold vapour atomic absorption \n\nspectrometry\n(19)\n\n in a Bacharach Coleman MAS-50D Mercury Analyser. Methyl-Hg was \n\nextracted by a previously described method\n(20)\n\n and its level determined by atomic \n\nabsorption spectrometry in a LECO AMA 254 Automatic Mercury Analyser. Moreover, \n\nwhereas total Hg content was determined in all individuals, methyl-Hg was determined \n\nonly in 10 individuals of each species. All contents were expressed in mg/kg of fresh \n\nweight. Furthermore, for those individuals whose methyl-Hg content was not determined, it \n\nwas assumed that the ratio between methyl-Hg and Hg contents was identical to that \n\n\n\ncalculated for the 10 individuals of each species, that is, 90.7, 86.6, and 83.9 %, for \n\ncuttlefish, squid, and octopus, respectively. \n\nApparent consumption data was estimated from cephalopods capture totals in Portuguese \n\nwaters (data from Portuguese National Statistics Institute, Instituto Nacional de \n\nEstat\u00edstica\n(21)\n\n) and trade data (data from EUROSTAT).\n(22)\n\n Thus, import values were added \n\nto capture volumes and export values were subtracted. Afterwards, the attained apparent \n\nconsumption values were divided by the population\n(23)\n\n and admitting that two thirds of the \n\ncephalopods weight would be surely edible, it was possible to estimate weekly per capita \n\nconsumptions of 10.2, 31.5, and 30.4 g/(week.person), for cuttlefish, squid, and octopus, \n\nrespectively. \n\n \n\n2.2. Raw Data Processing \n\nProbability distributions were fitted to the contamination and consumption data. Using all \n\ndata and imposing as previous condition that methyl-Hg contents must be positive values, \n\nthe best probability distributions, according to ?\n2\n tests for goodness of fit of the observed \n\ndistributions to theoretical ones, were achieved with the software @ RISK\n?\n\n \u2013 advanced risk \n\nanalysis for spreadsheets, from Palisade Corporation (Ithaca, NY, USA), version 4.5, 2005. \n\nFor consumption, log-normal distributions with means of 10.2, 31.5, and 30.4 \n\ng/(week.person), and truncated in zero (an enforced minimum) were selected for cuttlefish, \n\nsquid, and octopus, respectively. In Figure 1, the distribution for octopus is presented. \n\nHence, a significant frequency at near zero was achieved with this solution, accounting for \n\nthat portion of the population which does not eat cephalopod products. Log-normal \n\ndistributions are widely used distributional forms in probabilistic assessment\n(11)\n\n and seem to \n\n\n\nreflect the consumption patterns of cephalopod products in Portugal. Moreover, in the \n\nUnited States, using more complete data on the overall consumption of fish by the general \n\npopulation (from a survey conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service), strong log-\n\nnormal fits were found.\n(24)\n\n \n\n \n\n2.3. Intake Levels Calculation \n\nA distribution of the intake levels of methyl-Hg for cuttlefish, squid, and octopus can be \n\nachieved by combining the consumption log-normal distributions and the methyl-Hg \n\ncontent distributions for each studied cephalopod species. Alternatively, the latter \n\ndistributions can be combined with a given weekly personal consumption (encompassing \n\nspecific scenarios, from one portion to three portions of 150 g per week). In order to attain \n\nthe intake distributions, values of each distribution curve are randomly sampled according \n\nto the Monte-Carlo method.\n(25)\n\n In this method, a given randomly selected cephalopod \n\nconsumption from a virtual consumer (or a precise value of a specific scenario) is \n\nmultiplied by the contaminant content in the corresponding cephalopod species, also \n\nrandomly selected. This procedure is repeated many times with the software @ RISK\n?\n\n, \n\nrendering a random sampling size of 10000. Output values are divided by an average body \n\nweight, 60 kg,\n(10)\n\n producing a distribution of weekly toxic metal intakes expressed in \u00b5g per \n\nweek and kg of body weight. For this approach, the random sampling size must be largely \n\nsuperior to the sum of all sample sizes. This condition is fulfilled because 10000 is much \n\nlarger than the sum of 43 (maximum number of contaminant analyses) with 2 (effectively \n\nintroduced consumption data, that is, average and standard deviation). \n\n \n\n\n\n2.4. Risk Assessment \n\nMethyl-Hg risks to human health are assessed by comparing the weekly intake level with \n\nthe recommended safe exposure level, the methyl-Hg PTWI.\n(26)\n\n There are two alternatives \n\nfor estimating the risk: the plug-in (PI) and the tail estimation (TE) based estimators.\n(15)\n\n The \n\nmathematical formulas and methodology were extensively presented in a previous paper.\n(12)\n\n \n\nTE estimation is based on the EVT, which is focused on the tail estimation of the \n\ndistribution of the heavy metals intakes. Accordingly, the distribution tail is fitted to a \n\nPareto law, which consists in estimating parameters C and ? for \u2018sufficiently large\u2019 \n\nnumbers. These numbers are necessarily the k largest observed values of the output \n\ndistribution. Estimation of the parameters can be done according to the formulas: \n\n?\n=\n\n?\n\n+?\n\n\u00d7==\nk\n\ni\nnkn\n\nnin\n\nnk\n\nX\n\nX\n\nk\nHk\n\n1\n,\n\n,1\n\n, log\n1\n\n)(?  \n\nnkH\nnknX\n\nn\n\nk\nkC\n\n,/1\n, )()( ?\u00d7=  \n\nwhere, \n\nHk,n \u2013 Hill estimator; \n\nk \u2013 number of considered largest values in the sample; \n\nn \u2013 sample size. \n\nThe Hill estimator\n(16)\n\n is very sensitive to the choice of k. In fact, its bias increases with k, \n\nwhereas its variance decreases with k. This bias problem is explained by the perturbation of \n\ndata results through a slowly varying function, which causes deviations from a Pareto \n\nlaw.\n(27)\n\n So, a bias corrected Hill estimator may be required. For bias correction, the Hill \n\nestimator must be interpreted as an estimator of the QQ plot slope perturbed by a small \n\n\n\ndeviation induced by the L(x).\n(15)\n\n The estimation of the bias corrected parameters is done \n\nthrough the least squares method applied to the expression\n(18,27)\n\n: \n\n1\n\n1\n)(\n\n?\n\n\u00b5 ?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\u00d7+=\n\nn\n\ni\nDZLog\n\ni\n \n\nwhere, \n\nZi = i \u00d7 (Log(Xn-i+1,n)-Log(Xn-i,n)), following an exponential distribution; \n\n\u00b5 = Log? + \u00b50 (being \u00b50 the constant of Euler); \n\nD1=-?1 \u00d7 C\n-?1\n\n \u00d7 D; \n\n?1 = 1 .\n(28)\n\n \n\nIn this way, the bias corrected estimator of ? is calculated. These estimations can be done \n\nfor different values of k, enabling to find the optimal sample fraction k* by minimizing the \n\nasymptotic mean squared error of the Hill estimator.\n(15)\n\n With optimal k*, the risk of \n\nexceeding the PTWI, P(Xi>PTWI), may be estimated in a more accurate way. \n\n \n\n3. RESULTS \n\n3.1. Distribution of Me-Hg Content in Cuttlefish, Octopus, and Squid \n\nThe best fits for the methyl-Hg content in the three cephalopod species according to ?\n2\n test \n\nfor goodness of fit of the observed distributions to theoretical ones were attained with \n\nextreme value distributions (Table I). All these distributions were truncated at zero in order \n\nto avoid negative values. This solution was preferred to truncating at the limit of detection, \n\nsince some of the experimental data were below that limit. The fitted distributions means \n\nand standard deviations were identical to the same parameters of the raw data itself. The \n\norder of the methyl-Hg content means was the following one: cuttlefish>octopus>squid. \n\n\n\n \n\n3.2. Risk Assessment for Cephalopods in Specific Scenarios \n\nHypothesizing specific scenarios for cuttlefish, octopus, and squid consumption and using \n\nthe methyl-Hg distributions (Table I), it was possible to obtain intake distributions whose \n\nvariability only depends upon the methyl-Hg contents found in each cephalopod species \n\n(Table II). \n\nThe average weekly intake of methyl-Hg per kg of body weight was always below the \n\nmethyl-Hg PTWI (1.6 \u00b5g/(week\u00d7kg body weight)) even for the worst case scenario, a \n\nconsumption of three portions of 150 g of cuttlefish per week. But, besides the average \n\nvalues, other values were possible since some specimens may be more contaminated with \n\nmethyl-Hg than other. Therefore, for an adequate risk assessment, the probability of \n\nexceeding the PTWI, P(Xi>PTWI), was estimated. The PI and the TE estimators were used \n\nfor this objective. \n\nRegarding the PI estimator, methyl-Hg weekly intake distribution values never exceeded \n\nthe PTWI for squid in all hypothesized scenarios, leading to a null probability. Likewise, \n\nfor the consumption of only one portion of 150 g of any cephalopod species, the maximum \n\nvalues of the 10000 values of the methyl-Hg intake distributions were always below the \n\nmethyl-Hg PTWI, thus entailing a null probability. This illustrates a clear disadvantage of \n\nthis estimator: risk cannot be evaluated if PTWI is too large when compared to the higher \n\nobserved values.\n(15)\n\n Since a null risk does not exist, precise quantification requires another \n\nestimation method, that is, the TE estimation. However, for cuttlefish and octopus \n\nconsumptions of two and three portions per week, risk estimated by PI method was \n\ndifferent from zero. Moreover, this risk had an exponential progression, since, for instance, \n\n\n\na 50 % increase of the methyl-Hg average intake (from 0.4726 to 0.7114 \u00b5g/(week\u00d7kg \n\nbody weight)) led to a P(Xi>PTWI) almost 18 times higher (from 0.10 % to 1.75 %). This \n\nlast probability was undoubtedly non-negligible. Thus, someone consuming three portions \n\nof octopus each week is already exposed to some methyl-Hg risk and the same applies to \n\ncuttlefish. These risks albeit low have already some significance: approximately one in 57 \n\nand one in 164 consumers (eating three portions per week), for octopus and cuttlefish, \n\nrespectively, may be above PTWI. This may be the case of a consumer that eats \n\noctopus/cuttlefish from a particularly polluted area or a cephalopod whose specific traits \n\n(size, maturation, sex, etc.) may entail a higher level of contamination by methyl-Hg. \n\nOn the other hand, a more accurate estimation of P(Xi>PTWI) requires a more complex \n\nestimator based on EVT, the TE estimator. The k largest observed values are crucial for TE, \n\nthus, an optimal k* must be chosen. This is done according to theoretical assumptions and \n\nmathematical estimations (see Material and Methods, Risk Assessment), where \n\nminimization of the Hill estimator\u2019s variance and of its bias determines the choice of k*. \n\nThis calculation yielded TE estimator probabilities all different from zero. Nevertheless, for \n\none portion per week, P(Xi>PTWI) values were very low, not exceeding 0.00019 % \n\n(1:526316). The same applies to all squid consumption scenarios. As with PI estimator, \n\nwith higher average methyl-Hg intakes, an exponential progression of the probabilities was \n\nobserved. Interestingly, for the consumption of three weekly portions of cuttlefish and \n\noctopus, TE estimator yielded P(Xi>PTWI) values almost identical to those achieved with \n\nthe PI estimator. \n\n \n\n\n\n3.3. Risk Assessment for Cephalopods in the Portuguese Population \n\nThe estimated maximum weekly intake of methyl-Hg per kg of body weight was always \n\nbelow the PTWI, hence, PI estimates of P(Xi>PTWI) were zero (Table III). Once again, \n\nthis means that the PI estimator is flawed, since, when the PTWI is larger than the highest \n\nobserved (estimated) intake value, P(Xi>PTWI) becomes zero, but, a null risk never exists. \n\nThe TE estimator offers an alternative. As explained above, this required calculation of bias \n\ncorrected Hill estimators of the risk index ?, because of the substantial instability observed \n\nwith the uncorrected Hill estimators (Figure 2). However, such instability was lower than \n\nin other studies because consumption values were taken from a single and simple \n\ndistribution and not from a consumption survey, thus, the heterogeneity of consumption \n\nbehaviours behind an enhanced instability was lacking.\n(15)\n\n Additionally, the variance factor \n\nof AMSE was important for all cephalopod species, thus entailing k* values (Table III) \n\nhigher than those determined in a previous study.\n(29)\n\n In the case of the octopus, this meant \n\nusing the largest 335 intake values of the output distributions for estimating the bias \n\ncorrected Hill estimator, which, in turn, enabled to calculate the associated probability of \n\nexceeding the methyl-Hg PTWI. This probability was extremely low for cuttlefish and \n\nsquid, less than one in one million. However, for octopus, the TE estimator yielded a \n\nrelatively higher risk, since a P(Xi>PTWI) of 1:21000 (0.0048 %) was estimated (Table III \n\nand Figure 1). \n\n \n\n4. DISCUSSION \n\nWith respect to risk assessment in specific scenarios, various studies have already pointed \n\nout the relevance of a moderate consumption of some seafood species, such as black \n\n\n\nscabbardfish,\n(29,30)\n\n as a result of a high methyl-Hg content. However, for cephalopods, there \n\nare no recommendations of moderate consumption. In fact, no research, to the knowledge \n\nof the authors, has examined the risks associated to methyl-Hg in cephalopods. Hence, no \n\nconsumption recommendations have been issued. This study may help to change this \n\nsituation, since it clearly shows that the risk of exceeding the methyl-Hg PTWI is non-\n\nnegligible for cuttlefish or octopus consumption frequencies equal to or higher than three \n\n150 g meals every week. Thus, whereas for squid no consumption restriction seems \n\nnecessary, for the other two species an ideal maximal consumption of two 150 g meals per \n\nweek must be advised. However, it is not to be excluded the formulation of a further \n\nrestriction of the cephalopods consumption frequencies if other contaminants imparting \n\nhigher health risks to consumption of this seafood are found. Namely, this may be the case \n\nfor cadmium (Cd), since it has been reported that Cd levels in octopus sometimes exceeded \n\nthe recommended EU limit of 1.0 mg.kg\n-1\n\n while total Hg levels never surpassed the 0.5 \n\nmg.kg\n-1\n\n EU limit.\n(5)\n\n Effectively, molluscs very often accumulate Cd in digestive glands,\n(3)\n\n \n\nbeing found lower amounts in the arms and mantle.\n(31)\n\n Therefore, future studies should also \n\nassess the Cd risk associated to octopus consumption. \n\nAdditionally, the estimated risks associated to cephalopods consumption must be \n\ncompounded with those of other seafood also presenting substantial levels of methyl-Hg. \n\nTherefore, someone consuming two cuttlefish or octopus meals per week is taking a non-\n\nnegligible risk and, for consumers eating seafood several times every week, consumption \n\nshould be even more restrained and the addition of meals with fish, specially, from deep \n\nwaters, should be avoided. \n\nAnother interesting point is the comparison between the probabilities of exceeding the \n\nmethyl-Hg PTWI for cuttlefish and octopus consumption and the average methyl-Hg levels \n\n\n\nin these species. In fact, whereas cuttlefish presents higher contamination levels than \n\noctopus (0.106 vs 0.094 mg/kg), P(Xi>PTWI) values are systematically higher for octopus, \n\nregardless of the used estimator (Table II). This is due to the parameters of the contaminant \n\ndistributions, since both are extreme value distributions. The high ? scale parameter of the \n\noctopus methyl-Hg distribution is the main cause of this mathematical phenomenon (Table \n\nI). The octopus methyl-Hg distribution albeit presenting a lower average than the cuttlefish \n\nmethyl-Hg distribution has a much heavier tail than the latter distribution, as can be proved \n\nby the PI estimations \u2014for instance, for three meals per week, the cuttlefish distribution of \n\n10000 points shows 61 above the PTWI, while the octopus distribution of 10000 points has \n\n175 above the PTWI. \n\nThe combination of specific scenarios with the variability of methyl-Hg contents in \n\ncephalopods is a semi-deterministic approach.\n(11)\n\n This provides a more realistic assessment \n\nof risk. In fact, the non-negligible risks obtained for cuttlefish and octopus compare with \n\nthe absence of total Hg risk reported in the literature.\n(5)\n\n Latter authors used a full \n\ndeterministic approach, that is, the average Hg content in cuttlefish and octopus was \n\nmultiplied by an assumed consumption frequency of seven meals per week. Although this \n\nscenario was more extreme than those considered in this study, it was concluded that \n\nestimated Hg weekly intake was much lower than established PTWI,\n(5)\n\n thus leaving implicit \n\nthat no risk arises from Hg content in cephalopods. Of course, this work concerns methyl-\n\nHg (PTWI: 1.6 \u00b5g/(week\u00d7kg body weight)) and not total Hg (PTWI: 5.0 \u00b5g/(week\u00d7kg \n\nbody weight)) and methyl-Hg in this study is, at least, 80 % of total Hg content. \n\nNevertheless, this example highlights the great importance of taking any data variability \n\ninto consideration in order to reach a sound and more rigorous risk assessment. \n\n\n\nThe comparison between both estimators (PI and TE) also provides some insight into the \n\nadvantages and drawbacks of each estimator. The PI estimator does not allow a precise \n\nquantification when risk is small, since a null risk does not exist. Indeed, this conclusion \n\nwas also mentioned by other studies,\n(15)\n\n which also state that a small sample size impairs \n\nthe rigour of the PI method. On the contrary, the TE estimator allows a much more accurate \n\nquantification of risk in such circumstances. Nevertheless, for higher probabilities, there \n\nwas a remarkable convergence of both estimators, which seems to support the adequacy of \n\nthe much simpler PI estimator for a probability range between 0.1 and 2 %. \n\nNonetheless, the assumption of specific cephalopod consumption frequencies is not enough \n\nif a proper risk assessment in any given population is intended. It is deterministic on the \n\nside of consumption, since, for this input variable, a single point is used (for instance, 3 \n\nmeals of octopus per week). However, there is a distribution of consumption values. \n\nUnfortunately, given the absence of detailed consumption surveys (differentiating among \n\neaten seafood species) in Portugal, such distribution had to be hypothesized using a limited \n\narray of information. Therefore, log-normal distributions with means equal to the calculated \n\nPortuguese cephalopod consumption averages were considered instead. Hence, combining \n\nthese consumption distributions with the contaminants distributions, it was possible to \n\nobtain in this full probabilistic approach more realistic distributions of the weekly intake of \n\nmethyl-Hg in Portugal and to improve the associated risk assessment. \n\nConcerning cuttlefish and squid, given the size of the Portuguese population, 10617575,\n(23)\n\n \n\nrisk may be considered negligible. With respect to octopus, risk is still small (Figure 3), but \n\nmay be considered as non-negligible, since a risk of exceeding the methyl-Hg PTWI of \n\n1:21000 represents approximately 500 individuals in Portugal. However, it must be \n\nemphasized that the established PTWI level already integrates a safety buffer related to \n\n\n\nthose individuals more sensitive to the health effects of a high methyl-Hg intake. \n\nFurthermore, such individuals are a minority in the population. Accordingly, it can be \n\naccepted a negligible risk associated to the consumption of octopus per se in the Portuguese \n\npopulation. Moreover, the relatively higher risk ascribed to octopus is due to the \n\ncombination of high consumption levels (30.4 g/(week.person)) with relatively high \n\ncontamination levels (0.094 mg/kg). Though cuttlefish presents an even higher methyl-Hg \n\naverage content (0.106 mg/kg), its consumption levels are lower (only \n\n10.2 g/(week.person)). On the other hand, squid presents higher consumption levels \n\n(31.5 g/(week.person)), but its contamination by methyl-Hg is very low (0.035 mg/kg). \n\nOnce again, it should be remembered that these estimated risks for the consumption of \n\ncephalopods must be combined with risk arising from the consumption of other seafood \n\nspecies and food items in general. So, there is a greater risk in the Portuguese population of \n\nsurpassing methyl-Hg PTWI through food consumption than that risk estimated for octopus \n\nonly. In fact, in the French population, the probability of exceeding the methyl-Hg PTWI \n\nthrough food consumption was substantially higher, at least, in the most favourable \n\nscenario, 7.40 %.\n(15)\n\n Moreover, Portuguese consumers also eat other food items with \n\nrelatively high methyl-Hg levels, such as black scabbardfish. A previous study\n(29)\n\n has \n\nshown that the consumption of this fish species in Portugal entails a methyl-Hg risk of 1.19 \n\nor 1.81 %, according to the PI and TE methods, respectively. Additionally, another study\n(12)\n\n \n\nusing the five most consumed fish species in Portugal produced a probability of exceeding \n\nthe methyl-Hg PTWI as a result of fish consumption of 6.71 %. Accordingly, methyl-Hg in \n\nfood has to be treated as an important public health concern and further studies on the \n\nsubject are warranted. \n\n\n\nIn all this discussion of the results, the underlying assumptions should not be forgotten. \n\nNamely, one hypothesis underlying the utilization of available data is that individuals are \n\nsubjected to a constant exposure over time and keep the same consumption behaviour over \n\ntheir lifetime. This is a strong assumption which cannot be prevented, but might be relaxed \n\nby combining used methods with some ideas proposed by other authors,\n(32,33)\n\n if time series \n\nof consumption are observed. These methods were compared and discussed in a previous \n\nstudy.\n(34)\n\n Additionally, it is hypothesized that occasional short-term excursions above the \n\nmethyl-Hg PTWI would present no major health effect, provided that the average intake \n\nover long periods does not exceed the PTWI. Accordingly, the parameter of interest could \n\nbe viewed as the probability of occasional short-term excursions above the PTWI rather \n\nthan a true probability to develop a disease as a result of the exposure to methyl-Hg. \n\nTherefore, as main results of this study, it can be mentioned that while squid presents no \n\nserious health concern with respect to methyl-Hg, cuttlefish and octopus consumption \n\nshould be restrained to two 150 g meals per week. Moreover, the methyl-Hg risk \n\nassessment for Portuguese consumers revealed no danger concerning the observed \n\ncuttlefish and squid consumption levels. On the other hand, octopus consumption by \n\nPortuguese consumers presented a relatively higher methyl-Hg risk (1:21000). However, \n\ngiven the various assumptions used in this study, it cannot be considered a public health \n\nproblem. Nonetheless, this methyl-Hg risk associated to octopus consumption in Portugal \n\ncan be compounded by the risk of other foods containing significant methyl-Hg, thus \n\nmaking any new studies on methyl-Hg risk warranted. \n\nTE estimator was more accurate for lower probabilities, namely for the assessment of risk \n\nassociated to one or two meals per week or in the Portuguese population in general, \n\nrendering accurate risk estimations different from zero. However, for higher probabilities \n\n\n\n(roughly between 0.1 and 2 %), there was a remarkable convergence of both estimators, \n\nsupporting the adequacy of applying the much simpler PI estimator. Additionally, the \n\nlimitations of a deterministic approach were shown, being of great importance the \n\nassumption of variability for the two input variables, contamination and consumption \n\nlevels. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThis research was funded by Project Qalibra (Quality of Life - Integrated Benefit and Risk \n\nAnalysis - 022597).

The aim of\nthis study was to evaluate total arsenic content in the muscle of\neight fish species, three cephalopods, and one crustacean con-\nsumed in Portugal. The measurement of total arsenic (10 individ-\nuals of each species) was carried out by EDXRF (Energy Dispersive\nX-Ray Fluorescence Method). The highest concentrations were\nfound in Norway lobster (30.3 \u00b1 8.7 mg kg-1 wet weight), followed\nby common octopus (25.9 \u00b1 8.4 mg kg-1 wet weight). Within fish\nspecies, wild gilthead sea bream, anglerfish, and megrim species\npresented values around 12 mg kg,-1 and in the others the average\nwas lower than 10 mg kg-1. Taking into consideration the tolerable\ndaily intake recommended by the World Health Organization\n(WHO; 0.05 mg As kg-1 body weight), the obtained results of total\narsenic in the studied species do not represent a hazard for\nhuman consumption.\n\nKEYWORDS arsenic (As), fish, cephalopods, crustacean, Energy\nDispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF)\n\nThis work was supported by the project 22-05-01-FRD-00041 \u201cBenef\u00edcios e perigos\nassociados aos produtos da pesca (BENPER),\u201d PO Mare.\n\nAddress correspondence to Patr\u00edcia Anacleto, Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biol\u00f3gicos\u2013\nINRB-IP/IPIMAR, Avenida de Bras\u00edlia, 1449-006 Lisboa, Portugal.

This element has no known beneficial biological function, and\nthe long-term exposure may be harmful to health because of its acute and\nchronic toxicity (FSA, 2005, 2006).\n\nThe aquatic environment is important in the global cycling of arsenic.\nThe background level of arsenic in marine environments is slightly higher\n(2\u20133 mg/l) than in freshwater and terrestrial environments (Moore and\nRamamoorthy, 1985 and Phillips, 1990 in Klaric et al., 2004). Total human\nintake of arsenic occurs mainly via the food chain and depends on the\nquantity of seafood consumption (Su\u00f1er et al., 1999; Cava-Montesinos et al.,\n2005). Research has shown that marine organisms have the ability to accu-\nmulate arsenic naturally present in seawater and food, rather than only\naccumulating arsenic due to local pollution (Eisler, 1994 in ATSDR, 2000).\nMoreover, atmospheric deposits, output from rivers, and upwelling from\nmarine sediments lead to enrichment of arsenic in marine organisms (Neff,\n1997). In general, arsenic is present in high concentrations (orders of micro-\ngrams per gram) in seafood (Li et al., 2003). The arsenic levels in fish and\nshellfish are usually about 4\u20135 ppm, but may be as high as 170 ppm\n(Bennett, 1986, NAS, 1977b, and Schroeder and Balassa, 1966 in ATSDR,\n2000). It is known that intrinsic factors such as growth (size, weight), age,\ngender, sexual maturity, physiology, and stress influence the accumulation\nof trace metals in marine organisms (Phillips and Rainbow, 1993). For that\nreason, issues related to arsenic content in aquatic organisms and sea fish,\nin particular, have attracted considerable attention (Lai et al., 2001). And\ntherefore, suitable dietary guidelines are needed so that safe consumption is\nensured.\n\nIn seafood, arsenic can be found in various chemical forms (chemical\nspecies) and oxidation states that differ in their degree of toxicity and the\npathologies associated with them (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2000; Li et al., 2003). As a\ngeneral rule, inorganic arsenic, which predominates in seawater and sedi-\nments, is the most toxic form which can damage DNA and cause cancer.\nMost of the arsenic in seafood is present in nontoxic organic forms, such\nas arsenobetaine (Lai et al., 1999), that are metabolically inert and easily\neliminated by the human body (Fattorini et al., 2004) and, therefore, rep-\nresent a low risk to the consumers of fishery products (Neff, 1997). No\nmore than 2\u201310% of the total arsenic is potentially harmful as a toxic form\n(Fowler, 1983 and Freiberg, 1988 in Klaric et al., 2004). Since it is difficult\nto reliably measure the forms of arsenic present, most surveys measure\ntotal arsenic.\n\nAt the present time, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 1993)\naccords the highest priority (maximum concentration) to arsenic in its program\n\nD\no\nw\nn\nl\no\na\nd\ne\nd\n \nB\ny\n:\n \n[\nB\n-\no\nn\n \nC\no\nn\ns\no\nr\nt\ni\nu\nm\n \n-\n \n2\n0\n0\n7\n]\n \nA\nt\n:\n \n1\n0\n:\n1\n6\n \n2\n9\n \nM\na\nr\nc\nh\n \n2\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\n34 P.

The guidance level for crustacea is 76 mg kg?1 and\n86 mg kg?1for clams, oysters, and mussels.\n\nThe aim of this work was to determine the total arsenic content in com-\nmon species of fish, a crustacean, and cephalopods consumed in Portugal.\nMoreover, this study provides information regarding this element in a wide\nrange of samples of fresh fish. Muscle was chosen for analysis because it is\nthe major tissue consumed by humans and constitutes a significant percentage\nof the organism\u2019s body mass.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nSample Collection\n\nThe samples analyzed in this study were selected on the basis of their high\ndomestic consumption by the general Portuguese population. In total, about\n120 samples of eight fish species, three cephalopods, and one crustacean\nwere analyzed. The studied species were sardine (Sardina pilchardus),\nhake (Merluccius merluccius), wild and cultured gilthead sea bream (Sparus\naurata), anglerfish species (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa), black\nscabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), blackbelly rosefish (Helicolenus\ndactylopterus), megrim species (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis and L. boscii),\ncuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), European squid (Loligo vulgaris), common\noctopus (Octopus vulgaris), and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus).\nSpecies were obtained during several bottom trawl research surveys carried\nout by the INRB-IP/IPIMAR, in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean along the\nPortuguese coast during 2004\u20132005. Only wild gilthead sea bream was\nbought into one of the most important auction markets\u2014Peniche in November\n2005. Cultured gilthead sea bream were delivered by Portuguese aquacul-\ntures in 2004\u20132005.\n\nSample Preparation\n\nBefore analysis, samples were prepared by separating the edible portion\nfrom the inedible (guts, scales, heads, and bones). Only the commonly edi-\nble part (muscle) of the animal was selected for analysis. The number of indi-\nviduals of each species can be found in Table 1. Samples were homogenized\nin a food blender, frozen and freeze-dried for 48 h at ?45\u00b0C and low pres-\nsure (approximately 10?1 atm). Further, samples were powdered and stored\nat ?20\u00b0C under controlled humidity conditions until analysis.\n\nAnalytical Methods\n\nTotal concentrations of As were determined by Energy Dispersive X-Ray\nFluorescence Method (EDXRF).

Quantitative\ncalculations were made by the fundamental parameters method\n(Carvalho et al., 2005). Experimental parameters were obtained by cali-\nbration, using standard reference materials. The X-ray generator was\noperated at 50 kV and 20 mA, and a typical acquisition time of 1000 s\nwas used.\n\nThe samples were prepared by mixing and pressing the powder into\npellets 2.0 cm in diameter without any chemical pretreatment. Each pel-\nlet was glued onto a Mylar film, on a sample holder, and placed directly\nin the X-ray beam for element determination. For each sample, a mini-\nmum of two replicates were made in order to reduce the risk of analyti-\ncal error.\n\nThe accuracy of measurements was tested by the analysis of certified\nreference materials, MA-A-2 (fish flesh, obtained from the International\nAtomic Energy Agency), SRM 1566 (oyster tissue, obtained from the\nNational Bureau of Standards), TORT-2 (lobster hepatopancreas, obtained\nfrom National Research Council of Canada), and SRM 1571 (Orchard leaves,\nobtained from National Institute of Standards and Technology). The values\nobtained were 2.5 \u00b1 0.7, 13.5 \u00b1 1.5, 21.3 \u00b1 1.8 and 13.9 \u00b1 1.5 ?g g?1, dry\nweight, which is in accordance with the certified ones (2.6 \u00b1 0.1, 13.4 \u00b1 1.9,\n21.6 \u00b1 1.8, and 14.0 \u00b1 2.0 ?g g?1), respectively.

The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov\ntest (or the Shapiro-Wilk\u2019s W test) and the Levene\u2019s test were used to check\nthe normality and the homogeneity of variance of data, respectively (Zar,\n1999). Comparisons were made using the Kruskall\u2013Wallis test when the\nconditions were nonparametric (a violation of the test of homogeneity of\nvariances assumption). Correlations between total arsenic concentrations\nand total length were analyzed for each species separately with Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients for linear correlation. The significance level for statisti-\ncal analyses was always tested at a = 0.05 (p &lt;.05).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nAnalysis of Seafood Samples\n\nResults for the determination of total arsenic in the seafood species analyzed\nin this study are shown in Table 1. In all cases, number of samples analyzed,\naverage values \u00b1 standard deviation, and range in which they lie are shown.\n\nThe arsenic content (mg kg?1, wet weight [ww]) in the species analyzed\nwas in the range of 1.7\u201322.8 for fish, 3.5\u201344.7 for cephalopods, and 23.1\u201351.2\nfor crustacean (Table 1 and Figure 1). Median levels of arsenic in these\nthree groups were 5.1, 17.0, and 31.0 mg kg?1 ww, respectively (Figure 1).\nThis variation of arsenic in marine organisms is due to many factors, such as\nspecies, geographic location (Anke et al., 1997 and Navarro et al., 1992a in\nDelgado-Andrade et al., 2003), temperature, salinity of the water, as well as\nweight (Norin et al., 1985 in Storelli and Marcotrigiano, 2000).\n\nThe highest mean total As concentration was found in the Norway lob-\nster Nephrops norvegicus (32.2 mg kg?1, ww). Moreover, this species\nshowed the widest range within all species (Table 1). It has been reported\nthat total As concentrations in the tissues of crustaceans and molluscs are\ngenerally higher than those found in marine fish (Phillips, 1990 in De Gieter\net al., 2002). According to ATSDR (2000), the arsenic is mainly accumulated\nin the exoskeleton of invertebrates, which means a higher concentration of\nAs is found in crustaceans. For prawns, arsenic values range from 9 to\n19 mg kg?1; for shrimps, from&lt;1 to 40 mg kg?1; and for crabs, from&lt;1 to\n70 mg kg?1 (Norin et al., 1985 in Storelli and Marcotrigiano, 2000). The\nlevels reported in the literature for crustaceans also present a very wide\nrange of 2.31\u2013149.16 ?g g?1, dw (Brooke and Evans, 1981; Flanjak, 1982;\nVlieg et al., 1991; Attar et al., 1992; Larsen et al., 1993; L\u00f3pez et al., 1994;\nMu\u00f1oz et al., 1999, 2000). High arsenic levels in the muscle of these bottom\ndwellers can be associated with their habitat being closer to the muddy\nsediments, which are always higher in arsenic than surface waters (Byrd,\n\nD\no\nw\nn\nl\no\na\nd\ne\nd\n \nB\ny\n:\n \n[\nB\n-\no\nn\n \nC\no\nn\ns\no\nr\nt\ni\nu\nm\n \n-\n \n2\n0\n0\n7\n]\n \nA\nt\n:\n \n1\n0\n:\n1\n6\n \n2\n9\n \nM\na\nr\nc\nh\n \n2\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\nSeafood Arsenic Content 37\n\n1988 and Trembley and Gobeil, 1990 in Storelli and Marcotrigiano, 2000).\nAnother reason is that this decapod feeds on polychaetes, crustaceans,\nmolluscs, echinoderms, and detritus (Figueiredo and Thomas, 1967 in Kr\u00e5ng &amp;\nRosenqvist, 2006; Baden et al., 1990), which consequently present high lev-\nels of arsenic. Therefore, habitat and feeding are other important factors\ncontributing to the variability of arsenic in marine organisms. The samples\nin this present work had relatively large sizes, which may also explain the\nhigh levels of arsenic. In fact, the significant differences found (p &lt;.05) in\ntotal arsenic concentrations among Norway lobster, European squid, and\nalmost all species studied (except for anglerfish, megrim, and wild gilthead\nsea bream) also relate to the different diet and habitat in which they live.\n\nThe levels for common octopus and cuttlefish are the highest in the\ngroup (25.9 and 19.8 mg kg?1, ww, respectively) of cephalopods, while the\nEuropean squid exhibited the lowest concentration (4.0 mg kg?1, ww).\nCephalopods are carnivorous, active predators; and because they have very\nhigh feeding rates, most of the arsenic can be assumed to be incorporated\nby the diet (Villanueva and Bustamante, 2006). In the case of Octopus\nvulgaris, the largest contents may be due to the fact that these species are\ncharacterized by feeding primarily on gastropods and bivalves, which\nare filterers and consequently present high levels of arsenic; and secondly,\nare benthic species living in direct contact with the substratum, which rep-\nresents another possible pathway for arsenic accumulation (Seixas et al.,\n2005). On the other hand, the European squid feeds on fish, crustaceans,\n\nFIGURE 1 Total arsenic distribution (mg kg?1) in 3 groups of fish, cephalopods, and a\ncrustacean.\n\nD\no\nw\nn\nl\no\na\nd\ne\nd\n \nB\ny\n:\n \n[\nB\n-\no\nn\n \nC\no\nn\ns\no\nr\nt\ni\nu\nm\n \n-\n \n2\n0\n0\n7\n]\n \nA\nt\n:\n \n1\n0\n:\n1\n6\n \n2\n9\n \nM\na\nr\nc\nh\n \n2\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\n38 P. Anacleto et al.\n\nand cephalopods; but fish is the major and sometimes the only component, so\nthe concentrations of arsenic are lower in this species compared to other ceph-\nalopods. The common octopus and cuttlefish are the only species that do not\nshow significant differences (p &lt;.05) within the group of cephalopods.\n\nThe highest element level in fish samples was observed in anglerfish\nand megrim species, with mean values of 11.7 and 11.6 mg kg?1 ww,\nrespectively. The analyzed samples of black scabbardfish presented lower\nlevels (2.9 mg kg?1, ww), followed by the samples of cultured gilthead sea\nbream (4.0 mg kg?1, ww), blackbelly rosefish (4.4 mg kg?1, ww), and sar-\ndine (4.9 mg kg?1, ww). Marked variation in total arsenic concentrations\nobserved in fish samples reflects the variation among species.\n\nThe high concentrations found in different species of anglerfish and\nmegrim may be principally due to different feeding habits. In fact, anglerfish\nis a bathydemersal fish that is found on sandy and muddy bottoms feeding\nmostly on other fish and being half buried in the sediment waiting for their\nprey. Megrim is a benthic fish that occurs on soft bottoms and feeds mainly\non bivalves and small bottom-dwelling fishes as well as squids and crusta-\nceans that generally show high levels of arsenic. In addition, Survey on\nArsenic in Food (MAFF, 1982) recognized that flatfishes, which are bottom\nfeeders and live on or close to the sea bed, are readily exposed to the\ngreater quantities of arsenic that accumulate in sediments than other spe-\ncies. So, it seems that marine organisms acquire their arsenic burden\nthrough the food chain (Norin et al., 1985 in Storelli and Marcotrigiano,\n2000). But in contrast to Hg, for example, As seems not to biomagnify or\nbioaccumulate (De Gieter et al., 2002). Hence, black scabbardfish showed\nlow levels of arsenic despite being a top predator that feeds on crustaceans\nand cephalopods. Thus, and according to an extensive study of the factors\naffecting bioaccumulation of arsenic in two streams in western Maryland in\n1997\u20131998, no evidence of biomagnifications was found since arsenic con-\ncentrations in organisms tend to decrease with increasing trophic level\n(Mason et al., 2000). In this group, the differences between the concentra-\ntions found in the megrim in respect to black scabbardfish and cultured\ngilthead sea bream were significant (p &lt;.05). The same is true for the\nanglerfish and the latter two fish species.\n\nThe arsenic levels in wild gilthead sea bream (10.7 mg kg?1, ww) are in\ngeneral much higher than in the cultured (4.0 mg kg?1, ww; Table 1), which\nmay be due to a different diet, especially in cultured fish where feeds are\nused. Nevertheless, wild gilthead sea bream was not statistically different\nfrom all other species (p > .05).\n\nComparison with Literature Data\n\nRelated publications on total arsenic concentrations in several species of\nfish, cephalopods, and crustaceans can be observed in Table 2.

Anacleto et al.\n\nreported in the literature for crustaceans also present a very wide range of\n1.69\u2013137.32 mg kg?1, ww (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2000). Moreover, in the case of\nNorway lobster, much higher concentrations were obtained in the present\nstudy than in other surveys conducted by the Food Standards Agency (FSA,\n2005, 2006). In contrast, in another study conducted in Australia (Fabris\net al., 2006), the mean content was slightly higher (50.7 \u00b1 18.6 mg kg?1, ww)\nand in agreement with our results.\n\nThe concentrations found in muscle tissue of hake, anglerfish, and cuttle-\nfish are similar to those referred, respectively, by Storelli and Marcotrigiano\n(2000), De Gieter et al. (2002), and Lavilla et al. (2008). Moreover, values of\narsenic given in a report performed on the Portuguese coast with common\noctopus (Seixas et al., 2005) are in the same order as those found in this\nstudy. In addition, the samples of anglerfish present levels similar to those\nreported in the literature (Mormede and Davies, 2001; De Gieter et al., 2002).\n\nCompared to the results found by Falc\u00f3 et al. (2006) in species that are\namong the most consumed by the general Spanish population, the present\nwork showed higher levels for sardine, hake, cuttlefish, and European\nsquid. In contrast to this, arsenic concentrations found in our study were\nlower compared with another study in Spain (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2000) for the\nsame species. These authors also found high levels of total arsenic in megrim\n(28.45 \u00b1 17.71 mg kg?1, ww) and a wide range of the data (4.14\u201367.38 mg kg?1,\nww). Even larger values were found in the work done by Lavilla et al.\n(2008). The high values of arsenic often reported in the literature may be\ndue to the fact that the species could have been captured in highly contam-\ninated areas.\n\nIn two studies (Schaeffer et al., 2005; FSA, 2005) of wild and farmed sea\nbream, the arsenic levels found (5.26 mg kg?1, dw and 2.11 mg kg?1, ww,\nrespectively) were below those obtained in the present study. Moreover,\narsenic concentrations found in our work were higher in wild and cultured\nsea bream muscle when compared to other important species from aquacul-\nture, such as sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrux, and yellow perch, Perca flave-\nscens (FSA, 2005; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2006).\n\nThere are few data in the literature for total arsenic in black scabbardfish\nand in blackbelly rosefish, but they vary within a range of&lt;0.02\u201326.49 mg kg?1,\nww (Mormede and Davies, 2001) and 3.91\u201329.69 mg kg?1, ww (Amato et al.,\n2006), respectively. These levels showed a very wide dispersion when com-\npared to our results (1.71\u20134.80 and 2.84\u20135.78 mg kg?1, ww, respectively).\n\nCorrelations\n\nThere were no significant correlations (p > .05) between total arsenic and\nbody length in almost all species (Table 3). Only in the case of sardine,\nSardina pilchardus, was a significant (positive) relationship (p &lt;.05) found\n(Table 3). This means that the levels of this element usually increase in\n\nD\no\nw\nn\nl\no\na\nd\ne\nd\n \nB\ny\n:\n \n[\nB\n-\no\nn\n \nC\no\nn\ns\no\nr\nt\ni\nu\nm\n \n-\n \n2\n0\n0\n7\n]\n \nA\nt\n:\n \n1\n0\n:\n1\n6\n \n2\n9\n \nM\na\nr\nc\nh\n \n2\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\nSeafood Arsenic Content 41\n\nsardine with body size, so larger and/or older fish generally have higher\nconcentrations than smaller or younger fish (Storelli et al., 2002). However,\nno other correlations were evident, which means that total arsenic concen-\ntrations are not related to body size but probably due to the small sample\nsize.\n\nLegislation and Health Considerations\n\nAt the international level, very few countries have published guidelines/\nlegislation to regulate the maximum concentration of total arsenic in sea-\nfood products (British Food Manufacturing Industries Research Association,\n1993). The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee (1983) imposed a limit of\n0.1 mg kg?1, ww for total arsenic in food (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2000; De Gieter\net al., 2002), and the Arsenic in Food Regulations (SI 1959 no. 831 in FSA,\n2005), in the UK, lays down a general limit of 1 mg kg?1. Hong Kong has\nthe most tolerant legislation in the world, with maximum concentrations of\n6 mg kg?1, ww for fish and fish products and 10 mg kg?1, ww for shellfish\nand shellfish products (Phillips et al., 1982 in Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2000). The Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) suggests a limit of 76 mg kg?1 for crustacea\n(FDA, 1993). There is presently no Europe-wide regulation of arsenic in\nfood (FSA, 2005).\n\nConsidering the tolerable daily intake recommended by WHO (0.05 mg\nAs kg?1 body weight; WHO, 1983), the obtained results of total arsenic in\nthe studied species do not represent a hazard for human consumption. Only\nthe Norway lobster exceeded this value. However, taking into account the\nFDA (1993) consideration, most of the arsenic compounds found are\nmethylated, and therefore are relatively low in toxicity and do not present a\nconcern to the consumer.\n\nTABLE 3 Pearson\u2019s Correlations (R) Between Concentrations of Total Arsenic and Length in\nDifferent Species of Fish, Cephalopods, and a Crustacean\n\nSpecies Length range (mm) Correlation (As-length)\n\nCuttlefish 165.0\u2013315.0 0.5673 (p = .087)\nEuropean squid 130.0\u2013420.0 0.5298 (p = .115)\nCommon octopus 115.0\u2013245.0 0.3919 (p = .263)\nNorway lobster 29.5\u201359.5 0.6104 (p = .061)\nSardine 16.5\u201323.5 0.7573 (p = .011)\nHake 21.3\u201361.5 0.0388 (p = .915)\nBlack scabbardfish 88.2\u2013122.0 ?0.2854 (p = .424)\nAnglerfish species 43.1\u201377.0 ?0.3923 (p = .262)\nBlackbelly rosefish 25.3\u201336.0 ?0.2300 (p = .552)\nMegrim species 21.5\u201346.5 0.5445 (p = .067)\nWild gilthead sea bream 34.5\u201357.5 0.3100 (p = .455)\nCultured gilthead sea bream 23.0\u201336.5 0.4672 (p = .173)\n\nProbability values (p) are in parentheses.

It is also worth pointing out that farmed gilthead sea bream\npresented levels of total arsenic much lower than the wild one. From this\nwork we also conclude that the technique, EDXRF, is suitable for this kind\nof study. It is easy to use, nondestructive, and the samples do not require\nany chemical treatment and therefore avoid possible contamination.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAmato, E., Alcaro, L., Corsi, I., Della Torre, C., Farchi, C., Focardi, S., Marino, G.,\nand Tursi, A. 2006.

The production of canned fish has decreased in recent\nyears; however, several European countries still consume large amounts\nof these products. It is well known that such products may contain some\ntoxic metals such as mercury, cadmium and lead. In order to determine\nthe level of these three elements in canned seafood, several products\nwere analyzed (more than 1800 samples). The mean total mercury level\nwas 0.12 \u00b1 0.14 mg/kg wet weight, with the highest content found in\ncanned tuna. However, such values did not exceed the proposed limit for\ntuna by EU (1.0 mg/kg). All analyzed samples showed lead levels lower\nthan the indicated limits. On the other hand, a few samples (less than\n2%) of canned tuna and squid exceeded the limit values proposed for\ncadmium, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively. Taking into account the way\nin which these products are consumed, it can be concluded that canned\nseafood products do not represent a risk in terms of human diet.

Canned seafood products, total mercury, cadmium, lead,\nlegal limits\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFish and seafood can be an important part of a balanced diet for humans;\nhowever, some fish accumulate contaminants present in the aquatic environ-\nment including mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), which are toler-\nated only at very low levels (Voegborlo et al., 1999). Although toxic metal\ncontent in the oceans is very low, higher contents are found in localized areas,\nlike waters polluted by chemical and geochemical processes. Mercury accu-\nmulates up the food chain; therefore, high levels can be found in predatory\nspecies caught in areas with a high content of this metal. As a result, the con-\nsumption of fish becomes the primary pathway by which humans are exposed\nto mercury (Wheeler, 1996) and other metals. Actually, there are limits for\nthese three metals, defined by European Community Regulation 466/2001\n(EU, 2001) as amended by European Community Regulation 221/2002 (EU,\n2002). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also has the responsibility to\nsafeguard human health through regulation of foods and drugs. This agency\nsuggests maximum tolerable daily intake for cadmium (55 \u00b5g/person/day)\n(FDA, 1993a) and lead (75 \u00b5g/person/day) (FDA, 1993b). World Health Orga-\nnization (WHO) established a provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 5\n\u00b5g/kg body weight (bw)/week for total mercury (WHO, 1972), of which no\nmore than two thirds (3.3 \u00b5g/kg bw/week) should be from methylmercury\n(WHO, 1989; WHO, 2000).\n\nCanned fish is a product that still records a reasonable demand in several\nEuropean countries, namely in Mediterranean ones, and frequently the possi-\nbility that such seafood products show high levels of toxic metals is debated.\nSeveral studies were performed along this line many years ago, principally in\ncanned tuna (Chow et al., 1974; Sapunar and Jusic, 1979; Duve, 1981;\nSchindler, 1985; Hardisson et al., 1986; Romieu et al., 1994; Gajewska et al.,\n1995; Voegborlo et al., 1999), but there is scarcity of information for other\ncanned seafood products.\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to characterize the contents of total\nHg, Cd and Pb in several canned seafood products commercialized in Portugal\nin order to evaluate the existence of contamination in these products.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nAll seafood products utilized in this study were purchased from local retail-\ners between 2000 and 2002. Canned tuna, chub mackerel, sardine, eel, lam-\nprey, squid, octopus, blue mussels and some seafood spreads were examined.\n\n118 JOURNAL OF AQUATIC FOOD PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY\n\n\n\nCans were opened and, after draining off the oil, the meat was homogenized in\na food blender (Moulinette 320, Moulinex, France) and the samples quickly\nanalyzed.\n\nTotal Hg was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption according to the\nprocedure developed by Hatch and Ott (1968), described by Joiris et al.\n(1991). Accuracy was verified using the Certified Reference Material CRM-\n463 (tuna fish muscle: 2.85 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b5g g?1 Hg dry weight) of IRMM. The mean\nresult, for five replicates (2.87 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5g g?1 Hg dry weight) was in the range\nof CRM-463 with a relative error of 0.1%. Detection limit (DL) was 0.01 mg\nkg?1. Cd and Pb were performed by flame atomic absorption, following the\nmethod described in AOAC (1990). Accuracy was examined by participating\nin a Food Analysis Performance Assessment Scheme organized by Central\nScience Laboratory (Metallic Contaminants\u2013FAPAS, Series 7, Round 40,\n2002, England). The laboratory performance is inside the satisfactory range,\ni.e., |Z|? 2 (Z = ?1.1 for Pb; Z = 0.3 for Cd). Detection limits were 0.01 and\n0.02 for Cd and Pb, respectively. Analytical data for Hg, Cd and Pb are re-\nported as mg kg?1 on a wet weight basis. All data analysis was achieved using\nSTATISTICA (Statsof, Inc., USA, 2000).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nTable 1 presents the results of total mercury determination in all canned\nseafood products analyzed. The highest values were found in canned tuna,\ntuna spread, eel and lamprey. However, these concentrations did not exceed\nthe limits proposed by EU (2001 and 2002), 1.0 (tuna and eel) and 0.5 mg kg?1\n\n(lamprey). The mean values obtained by other authors for canned tuna (Noirfalise\nand Fouassin, 1981; Gajewwska et al., 1995; Voegborlo et al., 1999) are simi-\nlar to the present results, although lower than 0.7 mg kg?1. In the case of eel,\nan interval between 0.12 and 0.19 mg kg?1 with a mean of 0.16 mg kg?1 was\nfound. Such values are in accordance with those published by Edwards et al.\n(1999) (0.102-0.260 mg kg?1) and by Noirfalise and Fouassin (1981) (? 0.24\nmg kg?1) for the same species.\n\nTotal Hg levels detected in canned cephalopods were lower than 0.5 mg\nkg?1 (limit recommended by EU) in all samples studied, which is in agree-\nment with values reported by other authors (Falandysz, 1989; Falandysz,\n1990; Storeli and Marcotrigiano, 1999). For chub mackerel the range was be-\ntween 0.01 and 0.18 mg kg?1 closer to those found by Storeli et al. (1998) in\nfish caught off the Adriatic Sea. Samples of canned sardine, sardine spread\nand blue mussels presented the smallest values in this work. These low levels\nare usual in this kind of species and are in good coherence with results ob-\ntained by Tariq et al. (1991) and I-de et al. (1994). Nevertheless, some authors\n\nLouren\u00e7o et al. 119\n\n\n\n(Joiris et al., 1999) found higher levels for sardine species. This can be due to\nthe fact that these studies were performed with specimens resident in the Med-\niterranean, in which the process of bioaccumulation is more evident than in\nAtlantic species (Baldi et al., 1978; Renzoni et al., 1998).\n\nIn order to make illustrate the distribution of mercury levels of the most rel-\nevant canned seafood commercialized in Portugal, namely tuna, sardine and\nchub mackerel, all values are presented in the histograms (relative frequency\nof total mercury, in percentage) shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. The levels, ex-\npressed in mg kg?1 wet weight, were clustered in several classes, indicating a\nrange of concentrations [higher or equal to, and lower than]. Of the 425 sam-\nples of canned tuna fish analyzed (Figure 1), only one reached the EU limit (1\nmg kg?1) (EU, 2002). The majority of samples showed mercury levels be-\ntween 0.10 and 0.40 mg kg?1, being the higher relative frequency presented\nby class 0.20-0.30 mg kg?1. Such distribution was similar to that found by\nseveral authors for this kind of product (Duve, 1981; Krueger and Kruse,\n1984; Schindler, 1985; Gajewwska et al., 1995; Voegborlo et al., 1999).\n\nAll canned sardine samples (Figure 2) showed levels below the EU limit for this\nspecies (0.5 mg kg?1). Major relative frequency was exhibited by class 0.02-0.04,\nand only 3.2% of samples had concentrations higher than 0.08 mg kg?1. The distri-\nbution in canned chub mackerel (Figure 3) is similar to that found for canned sar-\ndine; however, a higher number of samples (25.4%) displayed upper levels.\n\nThe levels of cadmium are presented in Table 2. The maximum mean con-\ncentrations were found in canned molluscs (0.29 mg kg?1 for squid and 0.16\n\n120 JOURNAL OF AQUATIC FOOD PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY\n\nTABLE 1.

(1995) indicated similar mean values for canned squid. Some\nsamples of canned squid (18.5%) exceeded the EU limit (1.0 mg kg?1) pro-\nposed for this species (EU, 2001). These high levels can be attributed to the\npresence of visceral tissue in this canned seafood (Falandysz, 1989; I-de et al.,\n1994; Shulz-Schroeder and Schering, 1995). Values of Cd found by Schindler\n(1985) in canned mussels (0.30 mg kg?1) are higher; however, the range is\nsimilar. Lowest contents were presented by canned chub mackerel, spreads\nand eel samples; regarding canned tuna, in spite of one sample exceeding the\nEU limit (0.05 mg kg?1), the concentrations obtained in this work were lower\nthan that found by Voegborlo et al. (1999).\n\nLead was only detected in 120 samples of 526 analyzed; however, the max-\nimum levels obtained, 0.1 mg kg?1 (tuna), 0.2 mg kg?1 (sardine) and 0.3 mg\nkg?1 (blue mussels), were below the permitted limits (0.4, 0.4 and 1.5 mg\nkg?1, respectively) (EU, 2002). Studies performed in earlier years (Schindler,\n1984; Hardisson et al., 1985; Romieu et al., 1994) showed mean levels greater\nthan 2 mg kg?1 in some cases. These Pb high concentrations can be explained\nby the use of lead soldered side seam in cans.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, this study indicates that canned fish follows a pattern Hg >\nCd > Pb while canned molluscs show a profile Cd > Hg ? Pb. All values were\nlower than those found by other authors. Although high contents of mercury in\nfresh tuna are a concern, the present study showed the prevalence of levels be-\ntween 0.1 and 0.4 mg kg?1 in canned product. Such fact is probably due to the\nutilization of small size fish and, moreover, the seafood industry selecting fish\ncaught in less polluted areas. In reference to concerns about cadmium levels in\ncanned molluscs like squid, in which 18.5% of samples tested exceeded 1 mg\nkg?1, the major problem seems to be the utilization of whole body.\n\nTaking into account the type of consumption of these products it can be\nconcluded that canned seafood products do not represent a risk in terms of hu-\nman diet.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAOAC. 1990.
