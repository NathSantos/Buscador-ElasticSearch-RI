The 2000 \nand 2001 nesting seasons have been monitored at the Java\u00e9s River in Bananal Island, Brazil. Although they nest on \nthe same beaches, there is a separation of the nesting areas of P unifilis and P. expansa nests on the upper parts of the \nbeach. The incubation duration for P. expansa is influenced by the nesting period, the height of the nest from the river, \nthe clutch size, and the grain size in the site of the nest. Nests of Podocnemis expansa placed in coarse sediments have \nshorter incubation duration than those placed in finer sediments. The hatching success in P. expansa is influenced \nby grain size, incubation duration, and nesting period. The grain size is negatively correlated with hatching success, \nindicating that the nests situated in finer-grained sand have better chances of successful egg hatching than those in \ncoarser-grained sand. Nests of the end of the reproductive season have lower hatching success and incubation duration \nthan those at the start of the season. For P. unifilis, the nesting period and nest depth influence the incubation duration; \nmoreover, the river dynamics significantly affect the hatching success. \nThe oscillation of the river level and the moment of initial increase, the height of the nest from the river level, and the \nnesting period are all decisive components for hatching success. The results of this research show the importance of \nprotecting areas with great geological diversity, wherein the features of the environment can affect the microenviron-\nment of nests, with consequences on incubation duration and hatching success.\n\nKeywords: turtle, incubation, reproduction, yellow-spotted side-neck turtle, giant amazon river turtle.\n\nEcologia reprodutiva de Podocnemis expansa (Schweigger, 1812) e  \nPodocnemis unifilis (Troschel, 1848) (Testudines, Podocnemididae) no Rio Java\u00e9s, Brasil\n\nResumo\nO local da desova influencia a dura\u00e7\u00e3o da incuba\u00e7\u00e3o e o sucesso de eclos\u00e3o de duas tartarugas neotropicais brasileiras, \na tartaruga-da-amaz\u00f4nia (Podocnemis expansa) e o tracaj\u00e1 (Podocnemis unifilis). Monitoramos as esta\u00e7\u00f5es reproduti-\nvas de 2000 a 2001 nas praias do Rio Java\u00e9s na Ilha do Bananal. Apesar de as duas esp\u00e9cies desovarem nas mesmas \npraias, existe uma separa\u00e7\u00e3o entre as \u00e1reas de desova, com P. expansa desovando nas partes mais elevadas das praias. \nA dura\u00e7\u00e3o da incuba\u00e7\u00e3o de P. expansa foi influenciada pelo per\u00edodo da desova, pela altura do ninho em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao \nn\u00edvel do rio, pelo n\u00famero de ovos e pelo tamanho do sedimento.

J. Biol., 2010, vol. 70, no. 1, p. 85-94\n\nthough both species nest in the same beaches, there is \na spatial separation of their nests. In the Java\u00e9s River, \nP. expansa lays its eggs in the highest point of the beach, \nusually 300 cm above the river level, whereas P. unifilis \nconcentrates its nests in areas less than 150 cm above \nthe river level. The clutch size, nesting period, and incu-\nbation duration also vary between the species (Pritchard \nand Trebbau, 1984).\n\nData concerning nests located along the Java\u00e9s \nRiver, in the Araguaia National Park, located in the \ncentral-eastern region of Brazil in Tocantins State were \ncollected. The study site (50\u00b0 05\u2019 W and 9\u00b0 59\u2019 S) was \nlocated in the northern part of Bananal Island, approx-\nimately 25 km from the mouth of the Java\u00e9s River in \nthe Araguaia River. This area is one of the main nest-\ning areas for P.  expansa and P. unifilis and harbours the \nchelonian monitoring and protection headquarters of the \nRAN/IBAMA (Reptile and Amphibian Conservation \nand Management Centre, an organisation associated \nwith the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural \nRenewable Natural Resources). The dimensions of the \nbeach vary in length from 800 to 3,450 m and in width, \nfrom 160 to 470 m.\n\nGeomorphologically, all the beaches monitored in \nthe area can be classified as sandbanks. The nests receive \ndirect sunlight during a major portion of the day and only \nsome nests located near the riparian forest are shaded in \nthe late afternoon. The beaches are deprived of vegeta-\ntion, except for rare and scattered bushes.\n\nThe mean river level was calculated based on data \nprovided by the National Electric Energy Agency \n(ANEEL) from 1972 to 1999. During the years 2000 and \n2001, the level of the Java\u00e9s River along the beaches was \ndetermined and it was monitored only during the nest-\ning and hatching periods. Every day, the river level was \nrecorded on the beach opposite the camp, which was lo-\ncated between the beaches under study. \n\nIn 2000, the Cangu\u00e7u, Jaburu, Comprida, Murici, \nCoco, and Marreca beaches were monitored; and in \n2001, the Cangu\u00e7u, Comprida, Coco, Goiaba, and Bonita \nbeaches were examined. The beaches studied were \nchanged from one year to the next due to the territorial \ndemands of the local Indian tribes inhabiting Bananal \nIsland. A detailed description of the main beaches may \nbe found in the report by Ferreira-J\u00fanior and Castro \n(2003).\n\nData in relation to incubation duration and hatch-\ning success were collected during the months of August \nand December in the reproductive seasons of 2000 and \n2001. The incubation duration is defined as the time be-\ntween egg-laying and emergence of the first hatchling \nfrom the nest. Hatching success is defined as the ratio \nof the number of hatchlings to the number of eggs laid. \nNesting period is the time of egg-laying (Julian dates). \nThe beaches were monitored each morning to search for \ntracks that would indicate the presence of nests. To ob-\ntain the data on hatching success and incubation duration \nof P. unifilis, it was necessary to protect the nests from at-\n\n1. Introduction\n\nIncubation duration is frequently used as an indica-\ntor of metabolic activity in the embryonic development \nof turtles, which show temperature-dependent sex de-\ntermination. Several investigators have reported that the \nincubation duration in turtles is negatively correlated \nwith the incubation temperature (Ewert et al., 2004; \nValenzuela, 2001). The incubation duration is consid-\nered the easiest and least invasive method to estimate the \nsex ratio of the sea turtle hatchlings because the defini-\ntion of their sex depends on environmental conditions \n(Marcovaldi et al., 1997; Mrosovsky et al., 1999). In \nturtles, low temperatures induce low metabolic activity, \nlonger incubation durations, and a greater proportion of \nmales. These authors, who suggest the use of incubation \nduration as an indicator of sex ratio, are unanimous in \npointing out their concern and need for a broad model to \nabsorb climatic variations. Incubation temperature and \nconsequently incubation duration, may be affected by \nthe mineralogical composition of the sediment (Milton \net al., 1997), grain size (Souza and Vogt, 1994; Ferreira-\nJ\u00fanior and Castro, 2006a), albedo (Hays et al., 2001), \nnesting date (Baptistotte et al., 2003), nest depth (Souza \nand Vogt, 1994), and nest shade (Vogt and Bull, 1984; \nAlho et al., 1985), which affect the sex ratio of the hatch-\nlings. Both Podocnemis expansa (Alho et al., 1985; \nValenzuela et al., 1997; Valenzuela, 2001; Malvasio, \n2001) and Podocnemis unifilis (Souza and Vogt, 1994) \nhave temperature-dependent sex determination, indicat-\ning the importance of the nest site on the resulting sex \nratios.\n\nEnvironmental factors may differently affect the \nhatching success of different populations of the same \nspecies. In general, factors such as flooding (Alho and \nP\u00e1dua, 1982; Pezzuti and Vogt, 1999; Ferreira-J\u00fanior \nand Castro, 2005; 2006b), shade cover, nest depth \n(Wilson, 1998; Valenzuela, 2001), incubation tempera-\nture (Bobyn and Brooks, 1994; \u00d6z et al., 2004), soil \nmoisture (Packard et al., 1987), and type of soil (Packard \nand Packard, 1997) may affect hatching success.\n\nWe tested the hypothesis that both the incubation \nduration and the hatching success of P. expansa and \nP.  unifilis can be affected by the geological characteris-\ntics of the nesting place. The grain size, height of the nest \nfrom the river level and moment of increasing river level \nwere correlated to incubation duration and hatchling suc-\ncess to test if the nesting period and nest site influence \nthe turtle\u2019s reproductive success.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nBoth P. expansa and P. unifilis are widespread in \nSouth America, occupying principal rivers and afflu-\nents in the Amazon Region. Podocnemis expansa and \nP.  unifilis lay their eggs in sandbanks (denominated \nbeaches) that appear throughout the margins and inside \nchannels during the dry seasons (Pritchard and Trebbau, \n1984). Ferreira-J\u00fanior and Castro (2003) report that al-\n\n\n\nNesting ecology of Podocnemis\n\n87Braz. J. Biol., 2010, vol. 70, no. 1, p. 85-94\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Basic parameters of the nests\n\nDuring the nesting seasons in 2000 and 2001, there \nwere 447 egg-laying activities of P. expansa and 1068 of \nP. unifilis (Table 1). At Coco Beach in 2000 two nests of \nP. expansa hatched after only 38 days of incubation and \na success rate of 91.8% and 93.4%, higher than average \nof all other nests (85.4%).\n\nThe nesting period differed between different spe-\ncies in 2000 (n = 623, t = 72.9, p &lt;0.001) and 2001 \n(n = 503, t = 27.9, p = 0.005). The concentrated nesting \nin P. expansa was a consequence of the gregarious habit \nof the species, members of which usually climb up the \nbeach in large groups during nesting activity (Alho and \nP\u00e1dua, 1982). Although P. unifilis does not form groups \nto lay its eggs, nesting peaked in August, when 50% of \nthe eggs were laid within nine days (Figure 1)\n\nMean height of egg placement from the level of the \nJava\u00e9s River differed between the two species (n = 860, \np &lt;0.001). Podocnemis expansa nested in the upper \nparts of the beach (301.4 \u00b1 86.74 cm above the river lev-\nel, range 71-625 cm, n = 359), whereas P. unifilis nested \nin the lower sites (104.8 \u00b1 80.19 cm, range 9-467 cm, \nn = 501) (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nFor P. expansa, the incubation duration, the clutch \nsize, the clutch depth, and the height of the nest from \nthe river level varied significantly along the monitored \nbeaches (Table 1). For P. unifilis, the incubation duration, \nthe clutch depth, the hatching success, and the height of \nthe nests from the river level varied significantly along \nthe beaches (Table 2).\n\n3.2. Basic physical parameters\n\nIn the period from 1972 to 1999, the river reached \nits lowest level between 29 September (in 1995) and \n14 November (in 1993). In the years 2000 and 2001, the \nlowest level was reached between these dates, thus per-\nmitting important observations regarding the influence \nof the dynamics of the river on the hatching success of \nP. unifilis. In August 2000, when P. unifilis nested high \non the beaches, the river level lowered slowly at a rate of \n1.5 cm/day. In 2000, the peak nesting of P. expansa oc-\ncurred in September, coinciding with a slight increase in \nthe river level, which started to subside during the follow-\ning days (Figure 2). In 2000, all the protected P.  unifilis \nnests completed incubation without flooding. In 2001, \nthe increase in the river level on 30th September flooded \n72 of the protected nests (18% of the total) (Figure 2).\n\nThe grain size varied significantly among the \nbeaches and the granulometric variation of P. expansa \nnests (n = 244) was greater when compared to that of \nP. unifilis nests (n = 189). For P. expansa, only the peb-\nble and mud proportions remained fairly constant for all \nbeaches, probably due to the small ratio of these com-\nponents in comparison to the whole sample (<0.5% of \nboth fractions). For P. unifilis, the proportions of very \ncoarse sand, coarse sand, fine sand, and very fine sand \n\ntacks by vultures (Coragyps atratus and Cathartes aura) \nand hawks (Carcara plancus) with wire-screened shel-\nters. For calculating the hatching success in P. unifilis, \nnests lost due to bird predation were excluded because \nthis analysis was focused on how the physical environ-\nment affects incubation. All P. unifilis nests considered \nherein were protected by wire-screened shelters. \n\nThe height of the nest from the river level consisted of \ntwo categories: a) height during the nesting time, which \nreflected the conditions encountered by the turtles dur-\ning nesting activity, and b) maximum height of the nests, \nto establish a common standard level along the beaches. \nHeight of the nest from river level was measured with a \n5-mm-accuracy level. The maximum height of the nests \nwas recorded on November 1, 2000, and September 30, \n2001. On these two days, the Java\u00e9s River reached its \nlowest level, which was considered as a reference, al-\nlowing the comparison of nest heights along the various \nbeaches in the following years.\n\nSedimentary samples, weighing around 200 g, were \ncollected from each P. expansa and P. unifilis nest. The \nsediments were collected at a depth of 10 cm during the \ncollection of hatchlings. The sediments were sieved and \nclassified according to the Folk/Wentworth (Folk, 1974) \nscale, which involves the following divisions: peb-\nble (diameter >4 mm), granule (4-2 mm), very coarse \nsand (2-1 mm), coarse sand (1-0.5 mm), medium sand \n(0.5-0.25 mm), fine sand (0.25-0.125 mm), very fine \nsand (0.125-0.063 mm), and mud (<0.063 mm).\n\nComparisons of incubation duration, hatching suc-\ncess, nesting period, nest depth, and nest height between \nthe different species were carried out using the Student-t \ntests. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA one-way, followed \nby the Bonferroni post hoc test) was used to compare \nthese variables among the beaches when the data showed \na normal distribution. For datasets that significantly \nstrayed from the average, differences were examined by \nthe Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric ANOVA on Ranks, \nfollowed by the Dunn post hoc test. The variables ex-\npressed in percentage (hatchling success and grain size) \nwere transformed to arcsen before being submitted to the \nANOVA. The effects of nesting period, nest depth, nest \nheight from the river level, and clutch size on the incuba-\ntion duration and hatching success for each species were \nanalysed through multiple linear regression. All data are \nprovided as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD).\n\nAnalysis of grain-size influence on the incubation \nduration and hatching success required a separate treat-\nment. Each of the granulometric portions was considered \na quantitative and independent variable. To avoid colin-\nearity among the granulometric fractions, some portions \nwere removed from the data analysis. Kruskall-Wallis \nnonparametric ANOVA on Ranks, followed by the Dunn \npost hoc test, was used to analyse the effects of the grain \nsize of P. expansa and P. unifilis nests along the beaches. \nThe influence of grain size on incubation duration and \nhatching success was also tested by multiple linear re-\ngressions.\n\n\n\nFerreira J\u00fanior, PD. and Castro, PTA.\n\n88 Braz.

J. Biol., 2010, vol. 70, no. 1, p. 85-94\n\ntion to the river level. In 2000, maximum hatching of \nP. unifilis eggs occurred before November when the level \nof the Java\u00e9s River was still decreasing (Figure 2). In \n2001, the hatching occurred mostly in the beginning of \nNovember, when the river level was high (Figure 2). The \nnests most affected by flooding were those laid at the \nend of the nesting period and those situated in the lowest \nparts of the beaches. The significant difference in hatch-\ning success of P. unifilis between 2000 (92.2%) and 2001 \n(58.3%) was due to beach flooding. The grain size did \nnot influence the hatching success of P. unifilis.\n\nThe small depth of P. unifilis clutches facilitates at-\ntacks by vultures (Coragyps atratus and Cathartes) and \nhawks (Carcara plancus). Predation occurs, mainly, dur-\ning the first hours after egg-laying. There is also high \npredation of the P. unifilis hatchlings because predators \nare able to locate the nests after hatching takes place, at-\ntacking the nests before the hatchlings can leave the nest. \nIn the two years under study, 1068 P. unifilis nests were \nfound, and 462 were protected and/or managed during \nthe experiments conducted by research teams working in \nthe area. Of the remaining 606 nests, only seven (1.16% \nof the total) concluded the incubation without any pro-\ntection efforts.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nGeological characteristics of the nesting sites of \nP. expansa and P. unifilis were significantly different. \nThe two species nested in different areas of the beaches \nin Java\u00e9s River, with very little overlap. Podocnemis \n expansa nested in the upper areas of the beach near the \nriparian forests, whereas P. unifilis nested in areas closer \nto the river channel, preferably close to the base of the \ndunes (Ferreira-J\u00fanior et al., 2003). Lowest river level \nis a basic requisite for P. expansa nesting activity on \nthe Trombetas River, as pointed out by Alho and P\u00e1dua \n(1982) and Ferreira-J\u00fanior and Castro (2003) for the \n\nvaried among the beaches. In general, the beaches could \nbe divided into sandbanks consisting of well-selected \nmedium sand (Jaburu, Comprida, Murici, Marreca, and \nGoiaba Beaches) and poorly selected medium and coarse \nsand (Cangu\u00e7u, Bonita, and Coco Beaches). The beaches \nwith finer sediments were more elevated than those with \ncoarser sediments.\n\n3.3. Factors related to the incubation duration\n\nFor P. expansa, significant correlations were found \nbetween incubation duration, nest height from river lev-\nel, nesting period, and clutch size (Table 3). There was a \nnegative correlation between sediment size and incuba-\ntion duration of P. expansa in the years 2000 and 2001. \nCoco Beach, where the mean incubation duration was \n54.2 \u00b1 4.48 days, contained the coarsest sediments in the \nstudy area, and Jaburu Beach (mean incubation duration \nof 68.0 \u00b1 7.70 days) constituted the sandbanks with the \nfiner sediments.\n\nOnly the nesting period and the clutch depth af-\nfected the incubation duration of P. unifilis (Table 3). \nPodocnemis expansa and P. unifilis nests, formed in the \nend of the reproductive season, had higher incubation \nduration. None of the granulometric portions were corre-\nlated to the incubation duration of P. unifilis, suggesting \nthat the grain size did not affect the incubation duration.\n\n3.4. Factors related to hatching success\n\nHatching success of P. expansa was affected by the \nincubation duration, nesting period, and grain size. The \nincubation duration and nesting period were negatively \ncorrelated with hatching success of P. expansa (Table 4). \nNests structured at the end of the nesting season, and \nwith shorter incubation duration, had lower rates of \nhatching success. Nests placed in coarser sediments had \nlower rate of hatching success than those placed in finer \nsediments.\n\nHatching success of P. unifilis depended directly \non the nesting period and the height of the nest in rela-\n\nTable 3.

Both higher and lower \nincubation temperatures can cause embryonic death \n(Krause et al., 1982; Wilson, 1998; Valenzuela, 2001). \nAs P. expansa nests filled at the end of the reproductive \nperiod had shorter incubation duration with concurrent \nhigher temperature, embryonic death increased.\n\nIn the area under study, P. expansa has nests only in \nsandy open beaches. On the contrary, P. unifilis is less \nselective and nests in open beaches, lake margins, and in \nvegetated areas. Data on P. unifilis is only partially rep-\nresentative, and it should not be generalised for the en-\ntire population. This fact should be especially considered \nwhen analysing the nest predation, which is higher than \n98% (Ferreira-J\u00fanior and Castro, 2003). Other turtles, \nsuch as Chrysemys picta (Tinkle et al., 1981), Malaclemys \nterrapin (Burger, 1976), and Tryonyx muticus (Plummer, \n1976), which lay eggs in shallower nests, show high nest \npredation. However, in none of these examples is the pre-\ndation higher than that along the studied area. It is dif-\nficult to maintain a stable population under this intense \npredation (Congdon et al., 2000). In the vegetated areas, \nthe predation should be less, according to the observa-\ntions of other freshwater turtle species (Escalona and Fa, \n1998; Spencer, 2002). The intense predation along the \nJava\u00e9s River beaches is attributed to the type of predator. \nVultures and hawks patrol the beaches daily during the \nincubation and hatching periods, detecting nests of sev-\neral ages. Even nests without any evidence of their exist-\nence on the surface are found and predated. In contrast to \nthe observations related by Pezzuti and Vogt (1999) for \nP. sextuberculata, predation is independent of the density \nof P. unifilis nests. Both types of nests, those dispersed \nalong the beaches and concentrated nests, were similarly \nattacked.\n\nJava\u00e9s River. Eggs laid during the months of August and \nSeptember had a higher incubation temperature in both \nP. expansa and P. unifilis, because embryonic develop-\nment would occur during the warmest season of the year. \nFor these turtles, an approximate one-month nesting \nphase and distinct incubation periods (Figure 1) made \nit possible for their hatching to coincide with an increas-\ning river level. Podocnemis unifilis hatched earlier, at the \nend of October, when the Java\u00e9s River began to flood the \nlower parts of the beaches. Podocnemis expansa hatched \nlater, in the months of November and December; how-\never, because its nests are usually located higher on the \nbeach, there is usually sufficient time for the hatchlings \nto leave their nests.\n\nOne of the principal causes for the loss of fresh-\nwater turtle nests is associated with changing river lev-\nels over the years. Flooding is common in the case of \nP.  expansa, P. unifilis, and P. sextuberculata nests found \nalong the beaches of Peruvian (Mitchell and Qui\u00f1ones, \n1994; Soini, 1995), Colombian (Hildebrand et al., 1988), \nand Brazilian rivers (Alho and P\u00e1dua, 1982; Pezzuti and \nVogt, 1999; Ferreira-J\u00fanior and Castro, 2003; 2006b). \nFloods are also the main cause of nest loss of Trionyx \nmuticus (Plummer, 1976) and Emydoidea blandingii \n(Standing et al., 1999). Considering the Java\u00e9s River, \nthe beaches are high enough to assure the hatching of \nP. expansa nests, and the river-level oscillation has no \nsignificant impact on the hatching success of this popula-\ntion. In contrast, P. unifilis nests are greatly influenced by \nchanging river levels.\n\nThe timing of nesting affects embryonic develop-\nment because, indirectly, it is responsible for the climatic \nconditions during the incubation period (Mrosovsky and \nProvancha, 1992; Valenzuela, 2001). In 2000, P. expansa \nnests laid at the end of the nesting period had shorter \nincubation duration, suggesting that they were subject \n\nTable 4.

J. Biol., 2010, vol. 70, no. 1, p. 85-94\n\nTherefore, management projects that involve egg \ncollection from P. unifilis nests localised on the lower \nbeach (Mitchell and Qui\u00f1ones, 1994; P\u00e1ez and Bock, \n1998) should be analysed with caution. Nest flooding \ndoes not seem to follow a rigid pattern and its magni-\ntude depends on difficult-to-predict factors such as the \nstart of the rainy season and its intensity (Ferreira-J\u00fanior \nand Castro, 2003; 2005; 2006b). The nests located in the \nlower portions of the beach are submitted to greater soil \nmoisture and a more stable temperature than those in the \nhigher portions of the beach (Ferreira-J\u00fanior and Castro, \n2006a). As such, the reproductive strategy of P. unifilis \ncan be altered by selective egg collection. In species with \na long reproductive period, the loss of some seasons does \nnot result in significant effects on population stability \n(Congdon et al., 2000). The management projects that \ninvolve P. unifilis-transfer hatcheries should also consid-\ner the height of the nests from river level. Generally, the \nhatcheries are located in the higher parts of the beach, \naltering the characteristics of the hydric environment. It \nis suggested that P. unifilis hatcheries should be located \nin an area near the river, within a height of around one \nmetre. The inconvenience of this position is that a rising \nriver level might put the nests at risk, thus requiring an-\nother transfer. Nevertheless, this is the most recommend-\ned alternative, because the physiographic conditions of \nthe nests will then be preserved.\n\nNests of P. expansa situated in fine sediments \n(Jaburu, Comprida, Murici, Marreca, and Goiaba beach-\nes) have longer incubation duration than those located \nin coarser sediments (Cangu\u00e7u and Coco beaches). This \nfact has been well illustrated with a difference of 14 days \nbetween the average incubation durations of P. expansa \non the Coco and Jaburu beaches in 2000. This observa-\ntion has important consequences for projects that involve \nnest transfer. As the incubation duration of P. expansa is \naffected by the grain size of the nest, the nests should not \nbe transferred into a single and homogeneous hatchery. \nAs presented by Milton et al. (1997) and Naro-Maciel \net al. (1999), variations in the characteristics of hatchery \nsediments (such as grain size and mineral composition) \ncould cause alteration in temperature during incubation \nand consequently affect the sex ratio of the hatchlings. \nAs can be judged, it is desirable for the hatcheries to \nmaintain the sediment characteristics similar to those of \nthe origin of the nest.\n\nThe importance of the nesting place, mainly of the \ngrain size, is enhanced for P. expansa when compar-\ning distinct beaches in geological terms. Internally, the \nbeaches show homogeneity in the grain sizes, which can \nlittle influence the incubation duration and the hatching \nsuccess. But when one compares the effect among vari-\nous beaches, the influence increases, reflecting the im-\nportance of evaluating all the nesting sites and more than \none reproductive season. While extending the area of the \nresearch and different geological environments, the dif-\nferences among the physiographic characteristics and its \ninfluence on the reproduction of the turtles are reflected, \n\nwhich cannot occur in the case of only one beach or one \nreproductive season being considered.\n\nAcknowledgements \u2014 This article is part of the PhD Thesis of P. \nD.
