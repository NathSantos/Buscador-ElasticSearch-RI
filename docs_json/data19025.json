No contexto da tomada de decis\u00e3o \nrelativa aos problemas ambientais, a ARE tem-se mostrado como uma \nferramenta fundamental e eficaz, sendo cada vez mais utilizada nos pa\u00edses \ndesenvolvidos. Contudo, em Portugal, o seu uso continua muito limitado e \nincipiente.  \nA Lagoa da Vela, localizada no litoral centro de Portugal, \u00e9 um lago eutrofizado \npotencialmente exposto a contaminantes resultantes das actividades agr\u00edcola \ne pecu\u00e1ria que tem lugar na sua bacia de drenagem, e que comprometem \nseriamente o seu equil\u00edbrio. Assim, o presente estudo teve como objectivo \nplanear e desenvolver uma ARE retrospectiva na Lagoa da Vela, de modo a \nanalisar os riscos para o ecossistema aqu\u00e1tico resultantes da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a \nfontes de polui\u00e7\u00e3o difusa. Este estudo foi desenvolvido tendo por base a \nestrutura conceptual proposta pela Ag\u00eancia de Protec\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental Norte \nAmericana para AREs, a qual inclui 4 etapas principais: formula\u00e7\u00e3o do \nproblema, caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o, caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos efeitos e \ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos riscos. Na fase de formula\u00e7\u00e3o do problema o ecossistema \nfoi caracterizado, as fontes de polui\u00e7\u00e3o foram identificadas, elaborou-se um \nmodelo conceptual e definiu-se um plano de an\u00e1lise. Na fase de \ncaracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da exposi\u00e7\u00e3o confirmou-se a potencial contamina\u00e7\u00e3o da Lagoa \nda Vela por fontes de polui\u00e7\u00e3o difusa resultantes de actividades \nantropog\u00e9nicas locais, ilustrada, principalmente, pelas elevadas quantidades \nde nutrientes e pela presen\u00e7a de pesticidas nas \u00e1guas superficiais, nas \u00e1guas \nsubterr\u00e2neas, nos sedimentos e nos tecidos de peixe. Al\u00e9m disso, verificou-se \nque o uso de pesticidas nos campos adjacentes ao lago (nomeadamente \nalacloro) pode facilmente contaminar o sistema aqu\u00e1tico por lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o, \nfen\u00f3meno que \u00e9 amplificado pelas caracter\u00edsticas espec\u00edficas do local, como \nas propriedades do solo, a profundidade do aqu\u00edfero, etc. Mediante a \ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de pesticidas medidos na \u00e1gua superficial do \nlago e em sedimentos com valores de qualidade legislados e com dados \ntoxicol\u00f3gicos, surgiram preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es relativas a potenciais efeitos no biota \naqu\u00e1tico. As concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de pesticidas detectados na \u00e1gua subterr\u00e2nea \n(colhida nos po\u00e7os locais) ultrapassaram tamb\u00e9m os valores de seguran\u00e7a \ndefinidos para \u00e1guas de consumo, o que constitui uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o para a \nsa\u00fade da popula\u00e7\u00e3o local. A fase de caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de efeitos, baseada em \nbioensaios com esp\u00e9cies de fitopl\u00e2ncton e zoopl\u00e2ncton, padr\u00e3o e locais, \nmostrou que a contamina\u00e7\u00e3o do lago poder\u00e1 comprometer o seu fraco \nequil\u00edbrio afectando os produtores prim\u00e1rios. Por fim, a fase de caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o \nde riscos, atrav\u00e9s de uma metodologia baseada no peso das evid\u00eancias, \nsustentou potenciais riscos, induzidos pela polui\u00e7\u00e3o difusa, no ecossistema da \nLagoa da Vela e na sa\u00fade p\u00fablica local. \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n \n\nEcological Risk Assessment, diffuse pollution, lakes, nutrients, pesticides \n \n\nabstract \n \n\nEcological Risk Assessment (ERA) is a process for systematically evaluating \nhow likely it is that adverse ecological effects occur as a result of exposure to \none or more stressors. In the arena of decision-making processes concerning \nthe environmental problems, the ERA is a fundamental and feasible tool, and \nhas becoming an increasingly used process in developed countries. However, \nin Portugal their use stills limited and insipient.  \nLake Vela, located in the Portuguese littoral-centre, is a eutrophic lake \npotentially exposed to contamination generated by agricultural and livestock \nactivities held in its drainage basin, which are seriously compromising it\u00b4s \necological sustainability. Therefore, the present study aimed to plan and \nperform a retrospective ERA in Lake Vela to assess the risks posed by diffuse \nsources of pollution on the aquatic ecosystem. This study was conducted \naccording the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guideline for ERA \nprocesses, which include 4 main steps: problem formulation; characterization of \nexposure, characterization of ecological effects and characterization of risks. In \nthe problem formulation step the ecosystem was described, the sources of \npollution were identified, a conceptual model was designed and the analysis \nplan was defined. In the exposure characterization step it was confirmed the \npotential contamination of Lake Vela by diffuse sources of pollution from local \nanthropogenic activities, illustrated mainly by the high amounts of nutrients and \nby the presence of pesticides in surface water, groundwater, sediment and fish \ntissues samples. Moreover, it was verified that the use of pesticides (namely \nalachlor) on agricultural fields surrounding Lake Vela can easily contaminate \nthe aquatic ecosystem through leaching, a phenomenon that is enhanced by \nthe site-specific characteristics, such as soil properties, depth of the aquifer, \netc. The comparison of pesticide concentrations recorded in lake surface water \nand in sediment with regulatory and toxicological benchmarks generated \nconcerns about potential effects on the aquatic biota. The concentrations of \npesticides recorded in groundwater (collected in local wells) were also above \nthe recommended safety levels for drinking water, which constitutes a concern \nfor the local public health. The characterization of effects, based on bioassays \nwith standard and local phytoplanktonic and zooplanktonic species showed that \nlake contamination could compromise the weak balance of their communities \nby affecting the primary producers. At last, the step of risks characterization, \nperformed following a qualitative weight-of-evidence approach, provided \nevidences regarding the risks posed by diffuse pollution to the Lake Vela \necosystem and local public health.  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nVII \n \n\nTable of Contents \n \n\n                                                                                                                                             Page \nList of Figures XII \n\nList of Tables XVII \n\nGlossary XIX \n\nI   General Introduction \n\n \n\n27 \n\n1.1.

Ecological Risk Assessment  \n\nThe ecological risk assessment (ERA) process was developed in the 1980s with the \n\npurpose of evaluating the effects of the anthropogenic activities at the ecosystem level \n\nand integrates this ecotoxicological information into regulatory decisions (Campbell et al., \n\n2006). ERA was defined by the United States\u2019 Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) \n\nas the process that \u201cevaluates the likelihood that adverse ecological effects may occur or \n\nare occurring as a result of exposure to one or more stressors\u201d (USEPA, 1992). Hence, risk \n\nassessments are used to evaluate environmental problems associated with past, ongoing, \n\nand future practices (Pastorok, 2002). For example, ERA can be used to evaluate benefits \n\nof different managing decisions at contaminated sites, assess new chemicals prior to their \n\ncommercial production or evaluate the risks posed by effluents, industries or agriculture \n\nto ecological resources in the ecosystem (SETAC, 1997). In recent years, ERA has emerged \n\nas an important tool in environmental protection programs (USEPA, 1998). ERA clearly \n\nhas a key role in the ecological assessment of contaminated sites and has been widely \n\nused as a fundamental tool for linking science to decision-making (Moraes, 2002). \n\nThrough the identification of potential risks ERA permits to recognize environmental \n\nproblems, to select priorities for environment protection, to select targets to control, to \n\ncompare the efficacy of management options, and identifies critical knowledge gaps, \n\nthereby helping to prioritize future research (USEPA, 1992). Moreover, ERA provides a \n\ncritical component, enabling risk managers to make well-founded environmental \n\ndecisions.  \n\nThe ERA process is based on two major elements:  \n\nExposure - is the co-occurrence and interaction of stressors with receptors. Measures \n\nof exposure can include concentrations of contaminants in the environmental \n\ncompartments or residues bioaccumulated on biota \n\nEffects \u2013 are the changes that occurred in the eco-receptors as a consequence of \n\nexposure to stressor(s). \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n28 \n\nThe integration of data from exposure and effect assessments leads to an estimation \n\nof risk (Figure I.1). When the potential for exposure and effects are low, the risk will be \n\nlow. When both are high, the risk will be high.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I.1. General process to estimate risks in an ERA process. Adapted from SETAC \n\n(1997). \n\n \n\n \n\nA tiered approach is usually adopted in the ERA process. Lower-tier assessments are \n\nbased on limited data and reasonable worst-case assumptions and higher-tier \n\nassessments are based on more realistic and complex data. Throughout the tier approach \n\nthe assessment of exposure and effects is refined and the uncertainty associated to the \n\nrisk characterization in reduced (Maltby, 2006). \n\nRisk assessments may be performed for different environmental compartments (i.e. \n\nterrestrial, aquatic, atmospheric) and may be used to predict the likelihood of future \n\nadverse effects (prospective) or evaluate the likelihood that effects are caused by past \n\nexposure to stressors (retrospective). Prospective risk assessment is generally used to \n\nhelp the risk manager and regulators decide whether a chemical should be registered for \n\ncommercial production and use, and if so, under what conditions and control measures. It \n\nis usually generic (non site-specific). On the other hand, the retrospective risk assessment \n\nevaluates the effects of chemicals after they have been used and released into the \n\nenvironment and is usually regional, local or site-specific. In general, it is focused in the \n\neffects of a single chemical or chemical source, but it can be applied to evaluate human-\n\nEffects Exposure RISK \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n29 \n\ninduced changes that are considered undesirable as a result of multiple stressors, \n\nincluding chemical, physical and biological stressors (USEPA, 1998).  \n\nERA is subject to both variability and uncertainty (Regan et al., 2003). Variability is an \n\ninherent property of the system being investigated and includes interspecific, inter-\n\npopulation and inter-individual differences in exposure and response as well as temporal \n\nand spatial differences in the biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Variability \n\ncannot be reduced by increased information or measurement, but it can be characterized \n\nand its influence minimized by careful selection of study systems. Uncertainty is due to \n\nimprecise or incomplete knowledge and is a property of the relationship between the \n\nstudy system and the risk assessor. Variable uncertainty arises from imprecise, inaccurate \n\nor inappropriate measurements and can be reduced by improving measurement \n\ntechniques and study design. Uncertainty and variability inherent in the risk assessment \n\nprocess may mean that the real effects are larger than the estimated effects or vice-versa. \n\nConsequently, uncertainty and variability must be incorporated into the analysis of risk. \n\nRisk assessments are often based on information obtained on a small number of species, \n\nexposed to a single chemical under a given set of conditions for a limited period of time. \n\nThis information is then used to estimate the generic risk of both short-term and long-\n\nterm exposure of complex ecosystems exposed to multiple stressors; a process that \n\nincorporates many uncertainties. Risk assessment procedures take one of two \n\napproaches to addressing uncertainty. The first, commonly applied to deterministic risk \n\nassessments, is to apply uncertainty (or assessment) factors to either model parameters \n\nor outputs; the second is to analyze uncertainty using probabilistic approaches (Maltby, \n\n2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.1. USEPA and European Commission (EC) Procedures for Risk Assessment \n\nUSEPA was pioneer in the development of guidelines for ERA. In 1992 the Agency \n\npublished \u201cA Framework for Ecological Risk Assessment\u201d which was later updated by the \n\n\u201cGuidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment \"in 1998. The USEPA procedure for ERA \n\nincludes three major steps (Figure I.2): \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n30 \n\ni) Problem formulation: clearly defining the problem.  \n\nAt this step, the available information on stressor and sources characteristics, \n\npathways of exposure, characteristics of the ecosystems potentially at risk, and the \n\necological receptors are integrated. Three products are expected after this integration: \n\nthe selection of assessment endpoints which are the ecosystem\u2019s components or \n\nattributes of concern; a conceptual model that is a representation of the hypothesized \n\nexposure pathways of the different ecological receptors; and an analysis plan that \n\ndelineates the design of the analysis, including measurement endpoints and assessment \n\nendpoints, and methods for conducting the analysis phase of the risk assessment; \n\nii) Analysis: characterizing potential or existing exposure to stressors and their \n\nsubsequent effects. \n\nThe analysis phase includes two principal elements: characterization of exposure and \n\ncharacterization of ecological effects. During this process, the assessor quantifies the \n\nstressor release, its migration and fate and characterizes the eco-receptor(s). In addition, \n\nthe ecological effects are characterized through the establishment of dose-responses \n\nrelationships. This information is then used to evaluate questions arise during the \n\nproblem formulation; \n\niii) Risk characterization: integrating and evaluating exposure and effects information \n\nRisk characterization is the final phase of an ERA. It serves as the link between \n\nexposure and effects characterization providing an estimate of ecological risks. The \n\nprocess is based on exposure and stressor profiles developed according to the analysis \n\nplan.  \n\nOne of the major advantages of the USEPA procedure for ERA is related with its \n\nbroad scope that permits the adaption to different environmental problems and \n\nconsiders scenarios with multiple stressors.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I.2. The Ecological Risk Assessment procedure according USEPA (1998). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn 1996 the European Commission has also published the \u201cTechnical Guidance \n\nDocument (TGD) on Risk Assessment for new and Existing Substances\u201d (EC, 1996) \n\nconcerning risks to both environment and human health. The TGD was revised recently \n\ntaking into account the experience gained and was extended to the needs of biocides (EC, \n\n2003). The risk assessment procedure according the TGD consists of three steps (Figure \n\nI.3): \n\nProblem Formulation \n\n \n \n\nRisk Characterization \n\n \nCharacterization \n\nof exposure \n\n \nCharacterization \n\nof ecological \neffects \n\nA\nn\n\na\nly\n\nsi\ns \n\nA\ns n\n\ne\nce\n\nssa\nry\n\n: \n\nA\ncq\n\nu\nire\n\n d\na\n\nta\n, ite\n\nra\nte\n\n p\nro\n\nce\nss, m\n\no\nn\n\nito\nr re\n\nsu\nlts \n\nPlanning  \n(Risk assessor/risk \nmanager dialogue) \n\nCommunicating results to the risk \nmanager \n\nRisk management and communicating \nresults to interested parties \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n32 \n\n i) Assessment of effects, comprising: \n\n  a) Hazard identification: identification of the adverse effects that a \n\nsubstance has an inherent capacity to cause; and \n\n  b) Dose (concentration) \u2013 Response (effects) assessment: estimation of the \n\nrelationship between dose, or level of exposure to a substance, and the incidence and \n\nseverity of an effect. Derived from the ecotoxicological data and the application of \n\nassessment factors a Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) is estimated; \n\n ii) Exposure assessment: estimation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration \n\n(PEC), which is the concentration to which human populations or environmental \n\ncompartments are or may be exposed. The environmental concentrations are estimated \n\non a local level (PEClocal, concentration of a substance released from a point source \n\nassessed for a generic local) or on a regional level (PECregional, concentration of a substance \n\nfrom point and diffuse sources over a wider area); \n\n iii) Risk Characterization: estimation of the incidence and severity of the adverse \n\neffects likely to occur in a human population or environmental compartment due to \n\nactual or predicted exposure to a substance, and may include \u201crisk estimation\u201d, i.e. the \n\nquantification of that likelihood. This step involves the calculation of a quotient: the \n\nPEC/PNEC ratio. If the PEC/PNEC ratio is above 1, the substance is \u201cof concern\u201d and \n\nfurther information should be need.  \n\nThis procedure is focused on single chemical stressors and therefore is not well suited \n\nto assess ecosystems subjected to multiple kinds of stressors (Moraes, 2002).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I.3.

Challenges Associated with the ERA Process \n\nSome challenges facing ERA include the following: \n\nChemical datasets: \n\nRegarding the larger quantity of chemicals released into the environment only a small \n\nfraction is well characterized and available in robust datasets. This \u2018data-poor\u2019 group \n\nincludes most of the existing chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biocides and nanomaterials. To \n\nsurpass this limitation a new regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and \n\nAuthorization of Chemicals (REACH) has been proposed by the EC. However it still exist \n\nsome challenges associated with implementing this system due to the large number of \n\nchemicals to be processed and the lack of appropriate techniques for detecting, \n\nquantifying and assessing some of the chemicals concerned (Maltby, 2006). \n\nDifferent Modes of Action: \n\nThe current procedures to evaluate the environmental effects are designed to detect \n\nthese that occur during exposure and that can be measured in terms of changes in the \n\nsurvival, growth, reproduction or feeding rate of organisms. However, they cannot be \n\nreadily applied to substances with reversible, latent or trans-generational effects, nor to \n\nsubstances that result in effects not detected using standard ecotoxicological endpoints. \n\nSome chemicals may elicit effects that occur after exposure, either because the chemical \n\nis slow-acting, or because changes in the organism\u2019s physiology makes the chemical more \n\ntoxic, or because the chemical disrupts a developmental process that only becomes \n\napparent later in the life cycle of the organism. Latent effects have been reported for a \n\nnumber of carcinogens, endocrine disruptors and some pesticides (Maltby, 2006). The \n\ngreat challenge is to improve the understanding of the several toxic mode of action of \n\nchemicals and to use this understanding to develop more suitable risk assessments. \n\nMultiple kinds of stressors: \n\nIn real systems chemical contamination rarely occur in isolation and ecosystems are \n\nalso subject to a range of natural stressors. Nevertheless, current ERA procedures have \n\nlimited application in scenarios constrained by multiple kinds of stressors. The \n\ndevelopment of assessment procedures that take into account combined effects, \n\nresulting from multiple kinds of stressor, still remains a challenge. Moreover, currently \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n35 \n\nmethods for evaluating the toxicity of chemicals mixtures, which combination could result \n\nin additive/synergistic effects, are poorly established (Van den Brink et al., 2002).  \n\nTesting Different Species: \n\nIn general, ERA take into account a limited set of toxicity data for a few \n\nrepresentative species and extrapolate these data to a larger number of organisms. \n\nHowever, different species present varying sensitivities exposed to the same substances. \n\nIn this way, additional and/or alternative standardized ecotoxicity tests using test species \n\nthat replace or complement the species currently used are therefore needed to improve \n\nERA of chemicals (OECD, 1998). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. Lake Vela \n\nLake Vela located in the littoral-centre of Portugal (40\u00ba5\u00b4N 8\u00ba8\u00b4W, 45 m elevation), is a \n\neutrophic freshwater shallow lake (mean depth =1.5 m) with 70 ha of surface area. This \n\nlake makes part of a larger system of interconnected reservoirs, commonly designated by \n\nthe \u201cQuiaios Lakes\u201d, which are disposed in parallel with the coastline, in a sand-dune \n\nplaned site. In agreement with the European Commission, Lake Vela was considered a \n\nnatural habitat with community interest whose conservation requires the designation of \n\nspecial areas of conservation (MA, 1999), and was subsequently included in the Ecological \n\nEuropean Net - Rede Natura 2000 (CM, 2000).  \n\nLake Vela is potentially exposed to nonpoint sources of pollution generated by \n\nagriculture and livestock which constitutes a threat to the aquatic ecosystem and human \n\nhealth (Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes et al., 2006a). Comprising 48% of its drainage basin \n\narea (Figure I.4), the agricultural lands are abundantly fertilized and pesticides (e.g., \n\nherbicides) are intensively used for pre-emergent control of weeds in corn crops, namely \n\nLasso\u00ae and Roundup\u00ae (Abrantes et al., 2006a). The sandy nature of agricultural soils \n\nlocated on a sand dune plain (with low organic matter content and high permeability), the \n\ntopography of the system, the discharges of aquifer into the lake (Fernandes, 1999), the \n\nexistence of agricultural water channels in the direction of the lake and the shallow depth \n\nof the groundwater, are site-specific characteristics that enhance the risks of \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n36 \n\ncontamination of Lake Vela, namely through runoff or leaching. As a consequence of the \n\nexposure to nonpoint sources of pollution, this lake is facing serious environmental \n\nproblems, namely by the higher input of nutrients that accelerate the eutrophication \n\nprocess, and pesticides that constitute a potential threat to aquatic life and human \n\nhealth.  \n\nAlthough several studies have been relied on this aquatic system (e.g., Abrantes, \n\n2002; Barros, 1994; Alface, 1996; Ferreira, 1997; Pereira, 1997; Fernandes, 1999; \n\nAbrantes, 2006b; Castro, 2007), no ecotoxicological evaluation has been performed and \n\nno data exists on the risks to aquatic biota and human health. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure I.4.

Thesis Structure  \n\nThis thesis is composed by seven chapters. Chapter II, III, IV, V and VI correspond to \n\nmanuscripts that were submitted to SCI journals, being two of them already published. \n\n \n\nChapter I \u2013 Some background information on the ecological risk assessment process \n\nis presented, including the description of the USEPA and EC procedures for ERA and the \n\nmajor challenges associated with the risk assessment process. This chapter also presents \n\na general description of the aquatic system of Lake Vela and the environmental problems \n\nposed by diffuse pollution. \n\n \n\nChapter II \u2013 This chapter provides the basis for the entire ERA. It presents background \n\ninformation about Lake Vela, suggests a conceptual model integrating suspected sources \n\nof stressors with the defined endpoints and describes a plan to analyse data and to \n\ncharacterize the potential risks for the aquatic ecosystem. \n\n \n\nChapter III \u2013 A characterization of exposure was performed through the \n\ndetermination of pesticide residues in different compartments of Lake Vela system: \n\nsurface water, groundwater, sediments and fish tissues. To assess potential concern for \n\neffects on ecosystem and human health, the measured concentrations of pesticides were \n\ncompared with regulatory and toxicological benchmarks, in a preliminar assessment of \n\nrisks. \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n38 \n\nChapter IV - A whole sample toxicity assessment was used to evaluate the toxicity of \n\nwater and sediment samples from Lake Vela on freshwater species. To increase the \n\necological relevance of the bioassays providing useful and reliable information about \n\npotential effects to resident species and to comparatively analyse differences in \n\nsensitivity between species, local as well as standard species were used. In order to \n\nevaluate the spatial and temporal variations of Lake Vela contamination, this study was \n\nperformed seasonally, throughout one year, and two sampling sites at Lake Vela were \n\nselected: one in the east margin near agricultural fields and the other in the opposite \n\nmargin, surrounded by a pine-tree forest. \n\n \n\nChapter V \u2013 The seasonal variations in the phytoplankton and cladoceran \n\ncommunities of Lake Vela and their interactions were evaluated throughout one year. \n\nThis study allowed understanding the behaviour and linkages between the trophic levels \n\nunder advanced trophic conditions and therefore contributes to understand the natural \n\nvariability of the ecosystem. \n\n \n\nChapter VI \u2013 A terrestrial model ecosystem was used to assess the potential leaching \n\nof the herbicide Lasso\u00ae in agricultural soils around the lake and their ecotoxicological \n\nimpact on non-target freshwater species. To attain this purpose agricultural soil cores \n\nwere collected and used to simulate the leaching of a pesticide in laboratorial conditions \n\nfollowing local agricultural practices for pesticides application and crop irrigation. \n\nThereafter the toxicity of leachates was assessed through standard toxicity assays with \n\nalgae and cladoceran species. \n\n \n\nChapter VII \u2013 A general discussion is presented. Through a weight-of-evidence \n\napproach, in which the different assessed lines of evidence (chemical concentrations: in \n\nwater, sediment and groundwater; body burden; biological surveys; toxicity tests) were \n\nevaluated, it was possible to infer about the risks posed by diffuse pollution on the \n\naquatic ecosystem and human health. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter I \n\n \n\n39 \n\n1.5.

This aquatic ecosystem has been potentially exposed to \n\ncontamination generated by agricultural and livestock activities held in their drainage \n\nbasin, which seriously compromise their health. This work summarizes some background \n\ninformation and presents the problem formulation step of the ERA. Therefore, it \n\nevaluates the characteristics of the stressor(s), describes the ecological system and \n\nreceptors and suggests a conceptual model, which predicts the potential exposure \n\npathways, relating suspected sources to the defined endpoints. This introductory step \n\nalso described an analysis plan on the entire study, which includes a delineation of the \n\nassessment design, data needs, measures, and methods for conducting the analysis phase \n\nof the risk assessment process. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords \u2013 Ecological risk assessment; Lakes; Nutrients; Pesticides; Problem formulation \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n46 \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\nNonpoint sources of pollution constitute a problem of increasing concern all over the \n\nworld. Identified as one of the mainly universal sources of diffuse pollution, the \n\nagriculture, through the use of pesticides and fertilizers, contributes to physical and \n\nchemical changes in water properties, which are reflected in the biological integrity of the \n\naquatic communities. Agrochemicals have been detected in surface waters (e.g., Kruhm-\n\nPimpl et al., 1993; Larson et al., 1997; Tanik et al., 1999) and ground waters (e.g., \n\nMeinardi et al., 1995; Barbash and Resek, 1997; Cerejeira et al., 2003), and their toxic \n\neffects on aquatic organisms are well-documented.  \n\nLakes are especially endangered ecosystems because of the risk of high pollutant \n\nloads from anthropogenic activities in a shallow water body with low dilution capacity. \n\nEutrophication is one of the major and common problems of the lakes. However, the \n\nchemical contamination from diffuse sources also affects their balance. In this way, the \n\nneed to protect the lakes was already underlined by the European Commission in the \n\nEuropean Framework Directive for Community Actions in the Field of Water Policy (EC, \n\n2000).  \n\nDue to Lake Vela natural relevance, several studies have been relied on this aquatic \n\nsystem. Thus, its limnology has been well described by different authors (e.g., Alface, \n\n1996; Ferreira, 1997; Abrantes, 2002). Other studies (e.g., Barros, 1994; Pereira, 1997; \n\nFernandes, 1999) revealed the awareness about ecological threats for the ecosystem \n\nbalance. Barros (1994) evaluated the ecotoxicological implications of cianobacterial group \n\nin cladocerans, Pereira (1997) presented a management plan for Lake Vela and Fernandes \n\n(1999) realised a global and integrative analysis of the eutrophic process based on \n\nanalytical techniques and simulation models. However, the ecological effects of potential \n\nstressors in Lake Vela ecosystem have not been studied yet.  \n\nRecently occurrences in Lake Vela (e.g., large fish kills, toxic algal blooms) triggered \n\nthe development of a plan for an ERA in the lake and its drainage basin. This ERA process \n\nwill be performed to assess potentially adverse effects, occurring in the aquatic life as a \n\nresult of exposure to different chemicals and to provide sound scientific knowledge, in \n\norder to support decisions regarding management strategies and conservation measures.  \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n47 \n\nThis article provides the basis for the entire ERA. It presents background information \n\nof the site, suggests a conceptual model relating suspected sources of stressors with the \n\ndefined endpoints and describes a plan to analyse data and to characterize the potential \n\nrisks for Lake Vela ecosystem. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Methods \n\nThe methodologies used to assess the ecological risks in Lake Vela posed by diffuse \n\nsources of organic and chemical pollution, follow the USEPA Guidelines for Ecological Risk \n\nAssessment (USEPA, 1998). ERA was defined by USEPA (1992) as the process that \n\n\u201cevaluates the likelihood that adverse ecological effects may occur or are occurring as a \n\nresult of exposure to one or more stressors\u201d. Through the identification of potential risks \n\nit is possible to recognize environmental problems, to select priorities for environment \n\nprotection, to select targets to control, to compare the efficacy of management options, \n\nand identify research needs. Moreover, ERA provides a critical component enabling risk \n\nmanagers to make well-founded environmental decisions. The USEPA procedure for ERA \n\ncan be carried out either to predict the likelihood of future adverse effects (a priori) or to \n\ndetermine the likelihood whose effects are caused by past exposure to stressors (a \n\nposteriori). It starts with a problem formulation step, which is a planning and scooping \n\nprocess that establishes the goals of the risk assessment. Furthermore, there is an \n\nanalysis phase consisting of exposure and ecological effects assessment, followed by the \n\nrisk characterization, the last step that estimates the risk through integration of the \n\nresults obtained in the exposure and effect analysis. \n\nDuring the problem formulation, available information for the area is described, \n\nassessment endpoints are selected, conceptual models are constructed and a plan for \n\nanalysing and characterising risks is determined. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n48 \n\n2.3. Problem Formulation \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Description of the System \n\nLake Vela located in the littoral-centre of Portugal (40\u00ba5\u00b4N 8\u00ba8\u00b4W, 45 m elevation), is an \n\neutrophic freshwater shallow lake (mean depth =1.5 m) with 70 ha of surface area. This \n\nlake makes part of a larger system of interconnected reservoirs, commonly designated by \n\nthe \u201cQuiaios lakes\u201d, which are parallelly disposed along the coastline, in a sand-dune \n\nplaned site. It is limited in the East side by agricultural fields and some human \n\nsettlements, and in the West side by a forest road, which is separated from the lake by \n\npinetrees (Pinus pinaster) and acacias (Acacia spp.) (Figure II.1).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.1. Map of the drainage basin of Lake Vela showing the distribution of agricultural \n\nfields, stables for livestock and human settlements. \n\n \n\nThe littoral-centre of Portugal is located in the Mediterranean-iberoatlantic group of \n\nthe Mediterranean region, being the climate strongly influenced by the proximity of the \n\nAtlantic Ocean. Hence, it is characterized by dry and moderately hot summers and mild \n\nrainy winters, with a long wet period that starts in October and finishes in February. The \n\ntotal annual precipitation is of 900 mm, with monthly values higher to 100 mm in \n\nautumn-winter and lower to 10 mm in summer. Mean solar radiation is of 300 \n\ncal/cm\n2\n.day and the annual mean temperature is about 18\u00baC, with summer and winter \n\naverages of 23-24\u00baC and 12-14\u00baC, respectively (Fernandes, 1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n500 m   \n\nArboreal vegetation \nShrubby vegetation \nAgricultural fields \nHuman settlements \n\nLake Vela    \n\nStables   \n\n  \n\n  N   \n\nLisbon   \n\nOporto     \n\nFigueira  \nda Foz   \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\nP\nO\n\nR\nT\n\nU\nG\n\nA\nL \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n49 \n\nIn agreement with the European Commission, Lake Vela was considered a natural \n\nhabitat with community interest whose conservation requires the designation of special \n\nareas of conservation (MA, 1999), and was subsequently included in the Ecological \n\nEuropean Net - Rede Natura 2000 (CM, 2000). This lake was also classified as a first level \n\nnatural area protection, by the Municipal Director Plan of Figueira da Foz, defined on 30\nth\n\n \n\nof December of 1993. In addition, Lake Vela is a freshwater system included in the Baixo \n\nMondego natural areas list, according to PROT/RCL (Plano Regional de Ordenamento do \n\nTerrit\u00f3rio da Regi\u00e3o Centro Litoral) (CCRC, 1994). In fact, the PROT/RCL, defines a natural \n\nzone as \u201ca national territorial area provided with faunistic, floristic and landscape \n\nvariables, which individual or ecological characteristics enhance the area merit, therefore \n\ncontributing to Portuguese natural heritage enrichness\u201d. Subsequently, the preservation \n\nand utilization of this area should be constrained.  \n\nIn relation to the lake hydrology, besides the precipitation that falls directly in the \n\nwater body (10 % of the input), water also enters in Lake Vela from superficial and \n\nsubterraneous fluxes (67% and 23% of the input, respectively). These fluxes are generated \n\nin the drainage basin, which is due to the slope of the piezometric surface towards the \n\nlake depression. The excess of water is drained by the Zurr\u00e3o waterway, which runs to the \n\nSouth. The water circulation in this waterway corresponds to the largest proportions of \n\noutputs (76%), being the remainder (24%) attributed to evaporation (Fernandes, 1999). \n\nHence, the hydric regime of Lake Vela presents a balance between, on the one hand, the \n\noutput of water by the Zurr\u00e3o waterway and the input by superficial fluxes, and, on the \n\nother, by the evaporation and the subterraneous fluxes, being the maximum stored \n\nvolume of 7.0E+05\n \nm\n\n3 \n(Figure II.2). The retention time of water shows an annual average \n\nof 130 days, with a water renovation rate of 2.8 m\n3\n/year (Fernandes, 1999).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.2. Diagram of Lake Vela inputs and outputs. Adapted from Fernandes (1999). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Biotic Characterization \n\nDuring the year, Lake Vela presents an elevated diversity of aquatic vegetation. In a total \n\namount of 50 species, the macrophytes identified in this system are distributed among 25 \n\nfamilies of four taxonomic divisions: Charophyta, Chorophyta, Pteridophyta and \n\nEspermatophyta (Mach\u00e1s, 1995). This community was characterized by the dominance of \n\nCladium mariscus, Myriophyllum verticillatum, Nymphaea alba and species from Poaceae \n\nfamily (Mach\u00e1s, 1995). However, nearly 80-90% of the flooded lakebed does not contain \n\nany vegetation (Fernandes, 1999).  \n\nPhytoplanktonic community of Lake Vela was characterized by seven taxonomic \n\ngroups \u2013 Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cryptophyta, Chrysophyta, Dinophyta, \n\nEuglenophyta and Cyanobacteria \u2013 with a total of 49 genus. The taxonomic groups that \n\nshowed higher abundance levels are the Bacillariophyta in Winter, the Chlorophyta in \n\nSpring and the Cyanobacteria in Summer (Barros, 1994; Fernandes, 1999; Antunes et al., \n\n2003). The dominant species of Cyanobacteria is the colonial algae Microcystis \n\naeruginosa. Chlorophyta is mainly represented by the big size coccoid forms (e.g., \n\nCoelastrum sp., Pediastrum sp. and Scenedesmus sp.) and Bacillariophyta is mainly \n\nrepresented by Cyclotella sp. (Pereira, personal communication).  \n\nAccording to Rodrigues et al. (1993), the zooplankton was characterized by the \n\ndominance of rotifers in detriment of the cladocerans and copepods. The major \n\ncladoceran species recorded was Daphnia longispina, Ceriodaphnia pulchella and \n\nBosmina longirostris (Barros, 1994; Abrantes, 2002; Antunes, et al. 2003). The mainly taxa \n\n    \n\nStored water volume in    \nLake Vela   Zurr\u00e3o waterway   Superficial fluxes   \n\nPrecipitation   Evaporation   \n\nSubterraneous fluxes   \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n51 \n\nrecorded for the macroinvertebrate community were Hydracarina and Ephemeroptera \n\n(IAV, 1994).  \n\nThe fish community is composed by six species distributed for five families. The \n\nprevalent species are: pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), mosquitofish (Gambusia \n\nholbrooki) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), which are all introduced species \n\n(Castro, personal communication). For the herpetologic community eleven species of \n\namphibians were identified (65% of the total species described in Portugal) and ten \n\nspecies of reptiles (IAV, 1994). The amphibians European tree frog (Hyla arborea), nurse \n\nfrog (Alytes obstetricans), Western spadefoot (Pelobates cultripes) and natterjack toad \n\n(Bufo calamita) are species that are strictly protected by the Berna Convention (MNE, \n\n1981) and jointly with the Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi) and marbled newt \n\n(Triturus marmoratus) are considered species with community interest in need of strict \n\nprotection (MA, 1999). The amphibian Portugal painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi) is \n\nalso a species whose conservation require the designation of special areas of \n\nconservation (MA, 1999). As well, the reptiles Iberian wall lizard (Podarcis hispanica) and \n\ngrass snake (Natrix natrix) are species with community interest that require a rigorous \n\nprotection (MA, 1999). In relation to Lake Vela avifauna, it was already registered the \n\npresence of twelve species (IAV, 1993, 1994; Farinha and Trindade, 1994; Fernandes, \n\n1999). Cattle egret (Bulbucus ibis), Black- necked grebe (Podiceps nigricolis) and little \n\ngrebe (Podiceps ruficollis) are species that are strictly protected by the Berna Convention \n\n(MNE, 1981). Ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca) is a rare species according the Red Book \n\nof Portuguese Vertebrates (SEADC and SNPRCN, 1990) and is also considered to be a \n\npriority species with community interest, whose conservation require the designation of \n\nspecial areas of protection (MA, 1999). Regarding mammals whose habits depend on the \n\naquatic environment, the otter\u00b4s (Lutra lutra) presence has already been reported in Lake \n\nVela (Trindade et al., 1998). This species is strictly protected by the Berna Convention \n\n(MNE, 1981), is classified as insufficiently known by the Red Book of Portuguese \n\nVertebrates (SEADC and SNPRCN, 1990) and is a species with community interest, whose \n\nconservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation and requires a \n\nstrict protection (MA, 1999). \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n52 \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Sources of Contamination \n\nAgriculture constitutes one of the main sources of diffuse pollution in the world (Meinardi \n\net al., 1995; Loague et al., 1998). Agrochemicals, namely fertilizers and pesticides, play an \n\nimportant role in modern agriculture. Furthermore, they are produced and spread into \n\nthe environment in huge quantities.  \n\nNitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) can naturally occur in water, however the \n\nfertilizers run off, livestock production, discharges from domestic sewage, land erosion, \n\nand other sources, may increase their concentrations significantly (Hem, 1985; Wetzel, \n\n1993). Although a pesticide is usually applied to act on a specific target (e.g., a pest or \n\nweed), it may cause effects on non-target species through environmental transport \n\nprocesses. The transport of pesticides from the fields to the surrounding waters may \n\noccur by volatilization/deposition, run off and leaching (Barbash and Resek, 1997). These \n\nprocesses are constrained by climatic factors like rainfall, wind, temperature and \n\ntopography of the area (Kolpin, 1997; Burkart et al., 1999). Pesticides solubility, soil \n\nmobility and rate of degradation are the most important properties often used to predict \n\ntheir potential to contaminate the aquatic environment (Eke et al., 1996; Kolpin, 1997). \n\nIndeed, the characteristics of the environmental compartment where the agrochemicals \n\nare released on, also influence their dispersion. In this way, the texture and structure of \n\nthe soil as well as the amount of organic matter are factors that affect adsorption of \n\nagrochemicals to soil and, thus, their transport (Barbash and Resek, 1997). In addition, \n\nthe agricultural practices and techniques, evolving amounts and formulations of \n\ncompounds, also constrain their transport, degradation and transformation rates (Gish et \n\nal., 1995; Hansen et al., 2000; Wente, 2000).  \n\nDue to the sandy nature of soil (with higher permeability) and the small depth of the \n\ngroundwater, Lake Vela is potentially exposed to contamination generated by agricultural \n\nand livestock activities. The drainage basin of Lake Vela, defined by Fernandes (1999), \n\nshow at the East site an intense agricultural activity (Figure II.1) characterized by small \n\nrural proprieties and based in the broad groundwater exploration, where the mainly \n\ncrops are corn and grass for livestock. Owing to the poor nature of the sandy soils, the \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n53 \n\nlands are abundantly fertilised with organic compounds (livestock manures) and \n\nchemicals (syntheticals fertilizers). Inquiries realised by Pereira (1997) confirm the use of \n\nfertilizers, such as Foskamonio 111\u00ae and elementary manures, and also refers to the \n\nfrequent application of herbicides, like Roundup\u00ae and Lasso\u00ae. According to the local \n\nfarmers indications, the fertilization rates are about 150 Kg of N/ha\u00b7year (20% of organics \n\nfertilizers and 80% of chemical fertilizers) and 50-60 Kg of P/ha\u00b7year (more than 90% \n\ncorrespond to chemical fertilizers). In relation to the herbicides, the amount used per \n\napplication are about 2-10 Lha\n-1\n\n of Roundup\u00ae and 4-5Lha\n-1\n\n of Lasso\u00ae. Mixtures for \n\napplication are made by diluting 1 L of concentrate in 100 L of water, resulting a \n\nconcentration of 4.8 gL\n-1\n\n of alachlor (active ingredient of Lasso\u00ae) and a concentration of \n\n3.6gL\n-1\n\n of glyphosate (active ingredient of Roundup\u00ae).  \n\nGlyphosate (N-phosphonomethilglycine) is a non-selective herbicide registered for \n\npreemergent and pre-harvest use in crops. It is generally sold as the isopropylamine salt \n\nand applied as a liquid foliar spray, being among the most widely used broad-spectrum \n\nherbicide in the world, including Portugal, with a total annual of sales of 669,041 Kg \n\n(Vieira, 2004). Glyphosate may enter aquatic systems through surface runoff, spray drift \n\nand accidental spraying. As a result of adsorption to suspended particulate matter or \n\nsediments and microbial degradation it dissipates rapidly from water, with a half-life in \n\nwater ranging from a few days to 2 weeks (Giesy et al., 2000). Sediments constitute the \n\nprimary sink for glyphosate (USEPA, 2002a).  \n\nAlachlor (2-chloro-2\u2019,6\u2019-diethyl-N-methoxymethilacetanilidae) is the second most \n\nwidely used herbicide in Portugal, with a total annual of sales of 256,359 Kg (Vieira, 2004). \n\nIt is used for preemergent control of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in crops. Soil \n\nsorption coefficient values (log Koc=2.08-2.28) indicate that alachlor would have a medium \n\nto high mobility in soil, allowing their leaching from soil to groundwater. The less of \n\nalachlor in groundwater free aquifers materials (as Lake Vela groundwater aquifer) was \n\nvery slow, with a half-life ranging from 808 to 1518 days (USEPA, 2002b). Surface runoff \n\nof alachlor is also a pathway of water contamination, but the average half-life in surface \n\nwaters is low (6.5-8 days) (Aga and Thurman, 2001). Both photolysis and biodegradation \n\nare important for the dissipation of alachlor in water. Alachlor makes part of the list of \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n54 \n\npriority substances defined by the European Commission (EC, 2001), whose substantial \n\nrisk for the aquatic system demands a progressive reduction or cessation.  \n\nThe livestock breeding, the respective manure production and the untreated \n\ndomestic sewage accumulated in septic tanks are also other possible sources of Lake Vela \n\ncontamination.  \n\n \n\n2.3.4. Assessment Endpoints \n\nAssessment endpoints are explicit expressions of the ecological resources being protected \n\nand measured in a risk assessment analysis. They can be defined at different levels of \n\nbiological organization (e.g., individual, population, community, ecosystem or region) \n\n(USEPA, 1998). From a regulatory perspective, it is important to define the assessment \n\nendpoints, which should be chosen in a reliable and valid manner. As suggested by USEPA \n\n(1992), Suter (1993), Barton and Sergeant (1998) and Fisher et al. (2001), the selection of \n\nassessment endpoints in this study (Table II.1) was based on several concerns related to \n\necological, methodological and management arguments, including: i) their ecological \n\nrelevance, based on their role to help sustain the natural structure and their diversity in \n\nLake Vela; ii) their susceptibility to potential stressors, namely for pesticides and high \n\norganics loads of nutrients presents in Lake Vela; iii) their relevance to management \n\ngoals. It is important that assessment endpoints reflect societal values, which will always \n\nbe considered together with the ecological information; iv) their position in the food-\n\nwebs, including producers, primary consumers and higher trophic groups, which are \n\nexposed at different levels of contamination; v) the easily to measure their characteristics \n\ndirectly or the possibility to use measures that are easily monitored and modelled. \n\nAccording to the environmental regulations stated for Lake Vela (see description of \n\nthe system) it is extremely important to protect the fauna and flora in this natural area. \n\nThus, the main management goal of the risk assessment for Lake Vela is to provide \n\ninformation to support the management dealing with the protection of the aquatic \n\nenvironment.   \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nTable II.1.

Conceptual Model  \n\nThe conceptual model represents the relationships between stressors and ecological \n\nentities, and includes two principal components: the risk hypotheses and the conceptual \n\nmodel diagram. Risk hypotheses articulate the links among stressors, potential exposure \n\nand predicted effects on an assessment endpoint, based on available information and risk \n\nassessor judgments. The conceptual model diagrams are a visual representation of the \n\nrisk hypotheses, providing a dynamic analysis of relationships. According to Suter (1999), \n\nconceptual models are essential tools that will be used as an intermediate step in the ERA \n\ndevelopment. A conceptual model diagram of exposure of Lake Vela aquatic communities \n\nto stressors is represented in the Figure II.3.  \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.3.

The \n\nhypotheses for this ERA are presented below, and are described for each stressor: \n\nNutrients:  \n\nThe increase of nutrients load as result of anthropogenic activities in Lake Vela, may \n\nbe responsible for an increase of the phytoplankton biomass. As the primary producers \n\ncommunity undergoes changes, the structure of communities along the trophic web is \n\nsubsequently affected. The phytoplankton increase leads to the high turbidity of water, \n\nwhich in turn, may contribute to the depletion of the submerged macrophytes \n\ncommunity (Freedman, 1989; Caraco, 1993; Klinge et al., 1995). This fact enables changes \n\nin communities structure, as it reduces the surface area for algal fixation, the habitat and \n\nrefuge for zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, fish and waterbirds, as well as it impairs the \n\nslow biomass growth, which is responsible for long-term storage of nutrients removed \n\nfrom water-column and sediment (McDougal and Goldsborough, 1996). On the other \n\nhand, eutrophication can lead to the reduction of phytoplankton communities, for \n\nexample, the diversity, species richness and evenness of diatom communities can \n\ndecrease in response to organic enrichment (Steinman and McIntire, 1990). Additionally, \n\nsome phytoplankton taxa that respond more swiftly than others to increases in nutrients, \n\nas cyanobacteria, were favoured. \n\nThe quantity and quality of available food define the dominant zooplanktonic group, \n\nwhose populations adjust it to present conditions (Margalef, 1983). Thus, the increase of \n\nwater trophic level favours the rotifers dominance in detriment to the cladocera and \n\ncopepods (Pereira et al., 2002). In addition, the eutrophication process favours the \n\ndevelopment of cyanobacterial blooms including toxic species, and the subsequent \n\nreplacement of the common Daphnia by small cladocera (Klinge, 1995; Jeppesen et al., \n\n1999). In an advanced eutrophication process a reduction in the number of chironomides \n\nand other benthonic organisms may be observed, while the number of oligochaeta and \n\nthe benthonic biomass may increase (Wetzel, 1993). Indeed, the fish community could be \n\nprofoundly affected, occurring the replacement of autochthonous species, more \n\nsusceptible, by exotic species like perch (Margalef, 1983). The other trophic chain levels \n\n(e.g., insects, amphibians, birds and mammals, including humans) may also be subjected \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n58 \n\nto changes induced by the increase of the trophic state of the aquatic systems. \n\nUltimately, the increase of nutrients concentrations (P and N) can promote the excessive \n\nproduction of phytoplankton, which eventually dies and is decomposed by \n\nmicroorganisms that are responsible for the elevated rates of organic matter \n\ndecomposition and the subsequent hypoxia, leading to kill off fish and other aquatic life \n\nforms (Br\u00f6nmark and Weisner, 1992). \n\nPesticides:  \n\nThere is an evident risk that pesticides may end up in waters close to agricultural \n\nareas, as in Lake Vela (Pereira, 1997). When pesticides enter aquatic systems through \n\nenvironmental transport processes (e.g., runoff, volatilization and leaching) they may \n\ncause serious problems because they are specifically created to kill organisms.  \n\nThe level of pesticides in the aquatic ecosystems are often enough to cause effects in \n\nseveral organisms and affect the composition and structure of communities (Hanazato, \n\n2001). Macrophytes are strongly affected by pesticides, namely herbicides (Lewis, 1995), \n\nand as aforementioned, changes in their community enable subsequent changes in other \n\ntrophic levels. Alterations in zooplankton community structure induced by pesticides may \n\nalso alter the balance of lake ecosystems (Hanazato, 1998).  \n\nThe normal flux of energy mediated by algae-zooplankton-fish is modified in a lake \n\nimpacted by pesticides, which is due to the replacement of Daphnia sp. by smaller \n\nzooplankters such as rotifers and Bosmina (Hanazato, 2001). In this case, the primary \n\nproduction is transferred upwards, due to longer food chains that include invertebrate \n\npredators. Therefore, due to energy loss during transfer, from one trophic level to \n\nanother, the efficiency of energy flux from primary producers to top predators is lower in \n\na pesticide\u2013contaminated lake. \n\nBenthic feeders in permanent contact with pesticides sorbed to the sediment are also \n\npotentially exposed to pesticides. Certain pesticides tend to accumulate in organisms and \n\ntend to biomagnify along the food web, therefore enhancing the risk exposure for the top \n\npredators (fish, waterbirds, otters and humans). Once fishery is a recreative activity often \n\npracticed in Lake Vela (MAPA, 1990), the ingestion of contaminated fish may affect the \n\nhuman health. Moreover, as amphibian habits are intimately linked to the aquatic \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n59 \n\nsystems, they are particularly vulnerable to their contamination or alteration. Amphibians \n\ndecline has been well documented (e.g., Blaustein and Wake, 1990; Wake, 1991; \n\nBlaustein et al., 1994; Carey et al., 1999; Green, 2003), however the causes are not yet \n\ncleared up.  \n\n \n\n2.3.7. Analysis Plan  \n\nThe analysis plan includes the pathways and relationships between different analysis \n\nsteps (characterization of exposure, characterization of effects and characterization of \n\nrisk), and delineates the methods and measures that will be used to conduct each one \n\n(Figure II.4). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure II.4.

Characterization of Exposure \n\nThe characterization of exposure begins with the description of sources and the \n\nrespective generated stressors. This step will be based on the acquisition of maps, aerial \n\nimages and the compilation of relevant data (e.g., gathered together from previous \n\nstudies, observations of local environmental problems and changes, and contacts with \n\nlocal farmers and inhabitants).  \n\nIn order to evaluate the distribution of stressors several data will be compiled to \n\ncharacterize the ecosystem (e.g., topography, hydrology, pH, temperature, hardness, \n\ndissolved oxygen, conductivity) and the stressors (e.g., physico-chemical properties, \n\npersistence, transformation, mobility, bioaccumulation and depuration). In this way, \n\nmodels of transportation will be adopted or developed for present contaminants in Lake \n\nVela. In addition to this, for temporal and spatial stressors distribution various field \n\nmeasurements will be conducted in water, sediment and biota (fish tissues) \n\ncompartments, following APHA (1995), USEPA (2001) and USEPA (2000) methodologies, \n\nrespectively. Sediments can be a sink of contaminants which concentrations may reach \n\nmuch higher levels than those in the upper water-column. Thereby, long-term exposure \n\ncan often produce adverse effects to aquatic life (Vigan\u00f2, 2000). Fish are an important \n\nfood resource for some waterbirds and otters in Lake Vela. Furthermore, once \n\nrecreational fishing is practised, the consumption of contaminated fish may represent a \n\nrisk for human health, thus justifying its use as bioindicators of local pollution. According \n\nto the USEPA (2000) two different species will be analysed: a predator species \n\n(Micropterus salmoides) and a bottom feeder species (Cyprinus carpio). Different \n\nsampling sites will be defined in the margin close to agricultural fields and in the opposite \n\none, as well as in output and input waterways. Moreover, wells located in the drain basin \n\nwill also be considered in order to assess groundwater contamination. The input of \n\nagrochemicals to the aquatic systems often occurs in pulses rather than by continuous \n\nexposure (Handy, 1994), what is mainly related to climacteric conditions (e.g., the \n\nprecipitation enables the runoff and leaching of contaminants to the aquatic system). \n\nTherefore, having in mind these factors, samplings will be performed seasonally (one per \n\nseason). \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n61 \n\nThe third objective is to describe the co-occurrence between stressors and receptors. \n\nThis relationship is evaluated by comparing stressor distributions with receptor \n\ncharacteristics. In an attempt to characterize the receptors data regarding habitat, \n\nreproduction, feeding habits and sensitiveness to contaminants should be compiled. \n\nBiomarkers are considered a useful tool for indicating exposure and also for determining \n\nthe likely effects if exposure continues (Beliaeff and Burgeot, 2002; Hyne and Maher, \n\n2003). Several sensitive and feasible groups of biomarkers suggested by Van der Oost et \n\nal. (2003) for ERA programs will be assessed in Micropterus salmoides and Cyprinus \n\ncarpio, namely phase I enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and ethoxyresorufin \n\nO-deethylase (EROD)), genotoxic parameters (e.g., hepatic DNA adducts) and \n\nphysiological and morphological parameters (e.g., histopathology).  \n\nAvailable data related to the quantification of distribution and degradation of the \n\nstressors will be used to calculate the predicted exposure concentration (PEC) in surface \n\nwater and sediments (EC, 2003). Overall information regarding exposure and receptors \n\nwill be integrated by a Geographical Information System (GIS), therefore allowing the \n\nevaluation of their co-occurrence. Finally, conclusions will be summarized in an exposure \n\nprofile. \n\n \n\n2.3.7.2. Characterization of Ecological Effects \n\nIn order to characterize the ecological effects, changes in attributes of the ecological \n\nentities in response to stressors will be analysed (Table II.1). Two principal lines of \n\nevidence will support the assessment of the ecological effects: toxicity tests and biological \n\nsurveys.  \n\nAfter knowing the main pesticides used in the study area, the effects of these \n\nproducts (either commercial products or active ingredients) will be tested in laboratory. \n\nIn agriculture, however, it is common the use of different compounds to destroy different \n\ntarget plants. Thus, the laboratory tests will be performed with the individual products \n\nand their mixture.  \n\nFor phytoplankton toxicity test (growth inhibition test; OECD, 1984) will be used the \n\ngreen alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon flos-\n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n62 \n\naquae. Laboratory tests with zooplankton (acute and reproduction tests; OECD, 2000a \n\nand OECD, 1996, respectively) will be developed with the standard Daphnia magna and \n\nthe most representative cladoceran of Lake Vela - Daphnia longispina, being analysed \n\ntheir survival, growth and reproduction. Toxicity tests with fish (acute and juvenile growth \n\ntest) will be developed according to OECD (1992) and OECD (2000b) guidelines, \n\nrespectively, and will be used two of the prevalent species in Lake Vela: Lepomis gibbosus \n\nand Gambusia holbrooki. For amphibians acute toxicity test (ASTM, 1996) will be chosen \n\nthe species Rana perezi, which is a widely distributed and abundant species, and the \n\neffects will be conducted on all three life stages (embryo, larvae, and adult).  \n\nToxicity laboratory tests (acute and chronic) with Lake Vela water and elutriates will \n\nbe carried out using the above-mentioned species. Methods for performing receiving \n\nwater tests and elutriates toxicity tests are described by USEPA (1993, 2002c) and USEPA \n\nand USACE (1998), respectively. Hence, it will be defined a number of sampling sites to \n\ncollect the water and the sediment, which will be coincident with the sampling sites \n\nselected in the characterization of exposure. In addition to laboratory tests, data referred \n\nto chemical toxicity will be compiled. If possible, it will be determined, for each species, \n\nthe lethal concentration for 50% of a group of organisms (LC50), the no observed effect \n\nconcentration (NOEC) and the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC). \n\nIn relation to the biological surveys, it will be recorded the richness and abundance of \n\nseveral ecological entities defined from Lake Vela. USEPA (2003) provides a description of \n\nthe most appropriate sampling location, the most advisable sampling gear and \n\ninformation about sample processing and effort. The sampling sites that will be \n\nconsidered to perform this analysis will be the same as those ones mentioned above. Due \n\nto natural seasonal changes in the structure and composition of communities, this \n\nevaluation will be repeated along the year, temporally coinciding with the exposure \n\nanalysis. Comparing the obtained results with previous limnological works will be possible \n\nto evaluate the evolution of the lake status. \n\nFrom the available toxicity data a predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) will be \n\ncalculated for several entities according to the European Commission (EC, 2003). The final \n\nresults of ecological effects will be compiled in a profile document. \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n63 \n\n2.3.7.3. Characterization of Risks \n\nAt last, risk characterization serving as the link between exposure and effects \n\ncharacterization provide an estimate of ecological risks. A weight-of-evidence approach \n\nthat weighs multiple lines of evidence will be performed to characterize the risk, \n\nproviding more accurate estimates of effects and more consistent conclusions (Suter et \n\nal., 1999; Stahl et al., 2000). The process is based on exposure and stressor profiles \n\ndeveloped according to the analysis plan.  \n\nERA in Lake Vela is a complex process that involves the effects of multiple stressors in \n\nthe ecosystem, which contains numerous species that are interlinked and dependent. \n\nThus, risk estimates will be evaluated by using several techniques: field observational \n\nstudies, quotient methods and models. The field studies will measure biological changes \n\nin the environment based on exposure and effects data for selected ecological entities, \n\nproviding empirical evidence relationships. They present an advantage since they can be \n\nused to evaluate multiple stressors and complex ecosystem interlinks that cannot be \n\nreproduced in the laboratory (USEPA, 1998). Field survey data can be associated by \n\nmultivariate analysis, permitting to interlink between exposure parameters, habitat \n\ncharacteristics and ecological entities parameters (Pielou, 1984, Ludwig and Reinolds, \n\n1988; Ter BraaK and Verdonshot, 1995). On the other hand, the variables resulting from \n\nfield survey data can be combined and arranged as indices. The quotient methods, \n\nexpressed as a ratio between exposure and effects (e.g., PEC/PNEC ratios), although \n\npresent some limitations, they have advantages as they are simple, easy to use, and allow \n\nthe integration of risks of several chemical agents (USEPA, 1998). The development of \n\necological models that incorporate field observations, exposure characteristics, and \n\nlaboratory toxicity data will greatly help the risk characterization. A major advantage of \n\nusing models for risk estimation is the possibility of predicting future scenarios and such \n\nones can predict the outcome of different management options (Stahl et al., 2000). \n\nLake Vela is potentially exposed to diffuse pollution, being evident the risks for its \n\naquatic ecosystem. According to the researches that are being conducted in the area, we \n\nfound the presence of several pesticides in the water (e.g., alachlor, aldrin, anthracene, \n\ndieldrin, glyphosate and hexachorophene), sediment (e.g., alachlor, aldrin, anthracene \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n64 \n\nand glyphosate) and fish tissues (e.g., anthracene and alachlor), which confirmed their \n\nexposure and the potential bioaccumulation along the food web. In spite of the \n\nconcentrations recorded to be lower than the values of LC50 described for phytoplankton \n\nand zooplankton organisms (PAN Pesticide Database, 2005), toxicity laboratory tests with \n\nLake Vela water and elutriates showed sub-lethal effects on several standard and \n\nautochthonous species (except for the cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) \n\n(unpublished data). In general, we observed a growth inhibition of the algae \n\nPseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and effects in normal reproductive and growth patterns \n\nof the cladocerans Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina, with a decrease in the daily \n\ngrowth rate and in the number of offspring (unpublished data). Thus, our results \n\nindicated that the state of Lake Vela water and sediment represent a potential risk to \n\nphytoplankton and zooplanktonic communities, therefore constraining their viability. \n\nAdditionally, as reported by Antunes et al. (2003), Lake Vela is now more eutrophic than \n\n10 years ago. The occurrence of algal blooms, the increase in turbidity, the reduction of \n\nbiodiversity, and the occurrence of large fish kills are also some indicators of its alarming \n\ncondition. In this way, the risks for the aquatic ecosystem are evident, probably \n\ncompromising their entire wildlife and recreational use.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4. Conclusion \n\nAs a consequence of diffuse pollution, namely through the input of nutrients and \n\npesticides, the aquatic ecosystem of Lake Vela is facing serious environmental problems. \n\nHence, this lake is becoming a progressively more impoverished ecosystem, thereby \n\nrequiring a profound characterization of its risks to the aquatic communities, in order to \n\nimplement restoration measures to mitigate them. \n\nThe environmental recovery actions in Portugal are based on impact assessment \n\nstudies, which commonly consist of a compilation of biological survey data characterized \n\nby a little or absence of toxicological information. In order to surpass this setback, an ERA \n\nframework proposed by the USEPA was used to plan the assessment of ecological risks \n\ncaused by the diffuse pollution generated in the drain basin of Lake Vela. ERA could be \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n65 \n\nthe best boarding to follow, since there is a flexible and integrative process of orderliness \n\nand analysis of information related to the entire ecosystem, having as main goal the \n\nevaluation of the likelihood that adverse ecological effects are caused by exposure to the \n\nstressors (USEPA, 1998).  \n\nBecause of the variability and complexity of natural environment, the first step of an \n\nERA (problem formulation) is crucial and critical to provide a focus for the assessment. \n\nComplex investigations should include an integrated plan to permit the definition and \n\nprioritisation of tasks, hence allowing the scientific sound base elimination of some of \n\nthem, which are reflected in terms of costs and time spent. ERA in Lake Vela is essentially \n\nretrospective and based on field observations and samplings. However, it is possible to \n\napply for this analysis to predict future effects (e.g., related to human population \n\nincrease, that leads to the increase of sewage, to the increase of livestock or the \n\nextension of agriculture with the subsequent increase of pesticides and fertilizers use), \n\nthrough the use of models.  \n\nThe ecological effects on aquatic organisms caused by agrochemicals in water are \n\ndependent both on the maximum concentrations that the contaminants may reach and \n\non the exposure period of organisms to them. Differences in feeding, living habitats and \n\ntrophic level of species can affect their exposure to pollutants. Thus, ERA procedure in \n\nLake Vela suggests the use of different trophic levels to conduct the risk assessment and a \n\nsampling plan along the several seasons. The approach suggested to Lake Vela risk \n\nassessment is based on several lines of evidence (comparisons between measured \n\nconcentrations and toxicity endpoints, toxicity tests and biological survey), thereby \n\nallowing the balance between opposite factors and, in this way, providing a process to \n\nattain a consistent and feasible conclusion regarding the risk estimate. \n\nSeveral aquatic systems in Portugal, or even in other countries, have analogous \n\nproblems to that one of Lake Vela. Thus, the plan definition including its methodologies \n\nused in this study can also constitute useful tools to apply in similar places. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II \n\n \n\n66 \n\n2.5.

To assess potential concerning effects on ecosystem and human health, the \n\nmeasured concentrations of pesticides were compared with regulatory and toxicological \n\nbenchmarks. Residues of current and non-current pesticides, including two \n\norganochloride pesticides (OCPs) banned decades ago, were detected in surface water, \n\ngroundwater and sediment. The measured concentrations of pesticides compared with \n\ntoxicological benchmarks indicated that harmful effects are likely for aquatic species due \n\nto the presence of alachlor, aldrin and dieldrin. Additionally, the concentrations of \n\npesticides detected in groundwater were also above the recommended safety levels for \n\ndrinking water, which constitutes a concern for the local population\u2019s health. Results also \n\nshowed an accumulation of alachlor in predator and benthic fish species which could \n\nrepresent a risk to human consumers and particularly to the regular fish predators (e.g., \n\notters and birds). Notwithstanding this initial assessment of exposure and risks provides \n\nuseful information for the ERA process, it should be proceed through a weight-of-\n\nevidence approach. \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words: Diffuse pollution, pesticides, ecological risk assessment, aquatic ecosystems, \n\nhuman health. \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n80 \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\nLake Vela, located on the west coast of Portugal, is exposed to nonpoint sources of \n\npollution generated by agriculture and livestock activities which are a potential threat to \n\nthe aquatic ecosystem and human health (Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes et al., 2006a). \n\nComprising 48% of its drainage basin area, the agricultural lands are abundantly fertilized \n\nand large amounts of pesticides (e.g,. herbicides) are used for pre-emergent control of \n\nweeds in corn crops, namely Lasso\u00ae and Roundup\u00ae (Abrantes et al., 2006a). The sandy \n\nnature of agricultural soils located on a sand dune plain (with low organic matter content \n\nand high permeability), the topography of the system, the discharges of aquifer into the \n\nlake (Fernandes, 1999), the existance of agricultural water channels in the direction of the \n\nlake and the shallowness of the groundwater, are site-specific characteristics that \n\nenhance the risks of contamination of Lake Vela, namely through runoff or leaching from \n\nthe adjacent agricultural lands to the lake depression. As a consequence of nonpoint \n\nsources of pollution, this lake, similarly to several other Portuguese shallow lakes, is \n\nfacing serious environmental problems, caused by the high input of nutrients that are \n\naccelerating the eutrophication process, and pesticides that constitute a potential threat \n\nto aquatic life and human health. Moreover, Lake Vela is frequently used as a recreational \n\nsite, particularly for sport fishing and consequently the ingestion of contaminated fish \n\ncould put health risks to consumers. The use of contaminated groundwater as drinking \n\nwater can also be a pathway of human exposure and could constitute a great public \n\nhealth problem for the local population.  \n\nAlthough Lake Vela has been well characterized in terms of its limnology (e.g., Barros, \n\n1994; Alface, 1996; Ferreira, 1997; Pereira, 1997; Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes, 2006b; \n\nCastro, 2007), any ecotoxicological evaluation was performed and no data exists on the \n\nrisks to aquatic biota and human health. Therefore, a plan was defined for an Ecological \n\nRisk Assessment in Lake Vela (ERA) to evaluate the risks posed by diffuse pollution \n\n(Abrantes et al., 2006a). As part of this ERA, the aim of this study was give a contribution \n\nfor the characterization of the exposure of ecological receptors and humans, through the \n\ndetermination of pesticide residues in different compartments: surface water, \n\ngroundwater, sediments and biota (fish tissues). Furthermore, the concentrations \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n81 \n\nrecorded were compared with the environment quality guideline values (EQGV) and \n\nbenchmarks values. The generated information will be helpful in the preliminary \n\nassessment of the degree of pesticide contamination and of the potential risks to \n\necosystem and human health, providing risk assessors with relevant data for pursuing the \n\nERA process. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Material and Methods \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Study Area \n\nLake Vela is a shallow (0.9 m average depth; 2.4 maximum depth) eutrophic lake located \n\nin the littoral of Portugal (40\u00ba5\u2019N 8\u00ba8\u2019W, 45 m elevation) with a surface area of \n\napproximately 70 ha. It is part of a larger system commonly known as \u201cQuiaios Lakes\u201d, \n\nwhich is comprised by a coastal belt of dunes and a pine forest, about 6 Km from the \n\nAtlantic Ocean. Lake Vela is bordered on the west side by pines trees and acacias, and on \n\nthe east by agricultural fields, livestock farming and human settlements (Figure III.1). The \n\nhydric regime is mainly influenced by the superficial and subterraneous fluxes (67% and \n\n23%, respectively), the remainder being attributed to rainfall (Fernandes, 1999). Due to \n\nthe slope of the piezometric surface towards the lake depression, the fluxes are \n\neffectively discharged into Lake Vela. The main crop in agricultural lands is corn for \n\nlivestock whose cultivation starts with land tillage in late April and continues until \n\nSeptember, when corn is harvested.  \n\nLake Vela was considered a natural habitat with interest within the European \n\nCommunity, being classified as a special area for conservation (MA, 1999), and \n\nsubsequently included in the Ecological European Net - Rede Natura 2000 (CM, 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n82 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III.1. Map of Lake Vela showing distribution of agricultural fields, vegetation, \n\nhuman settlements and stables for livestock. ? - indicates the sampling sites of surface \n\nwater (SW), sediment (S) and groundwater (GW). \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Sampling Strategy and Storage \n\nTo assess spatial variation in terms of contamination by pesticides, sediment (S) and \n\nsubsurface water (SW) samples were collected from 5 sites of Lake Vela (Figure III.1): at \n\nthe north, near the input waterway (SW1 and S1); at the east, in the margin surrounded \n\nby agricultural fields (SW2, S2, SW3 and S3); at the south, near the output waterway and \n\nalso surrounded by agricultural lands (SW4 and S4); at the west, in the margin surrounded \n\nby the pine tree forest (SW5 and S5). To assess potential groundwater contamination, \n\nsamples (GW1 and GW2) were taken from two wells located in the drainage basin of the \n\nlake with a Van Dorn bottle (Figure III.1). Water samples (subsurface and groundwater) \n\nwere collected in a 5 L glass flasks following the USEPA recommendations (USEPA, 2002). \n\nSediment samples (three samples per site) were collected according to the USEPA \n\nguidelines (USEPA, 2001) using a stainless steel corer and transferred into storage \n\ncontainers specially prepared for pesticide analysis. In the laboratory, the sediment \n\nsamples were homogenised and sieved in a 2 mm mesh size sieve. In order to minimize \n\nthe sampling heterogeneity the samples collected in each site were mixed to get a \n\n \n\n500 m   \n\nArboreal vegetation \nShrubby vegetation \nAgricultural fields \nHuman settlements \n\nLake Vela    \n\nStables   \n\n  \n\n  N   \n\nLisbon   \n\nOporto     \n\nFigueira  \nda Foz   \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\nP\nO\n\nR\nT\n\nU\nG\n\nA\nL \n\n SW2, S2 \n\n SW1, S1 \n\n SW5, S5 \n\n SW4, S4 \n SW3, S3 \n\n GW1 \n\n GW2 \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n83 \n\ncomposite sample. Water and sediment samples were stored in the dark at 4\u00baC \n\n(maximum storage time: 1 week) until analysis.  \n\nTwo fish species with different habitats and feeding strategies were sampled by \n\nelectro-fishing: the predator Micropterus salmoides and the bottom-feeding Cyprinus \n\ncarpio. The procedures of samples collection and handling followed the USEPA guidance \n\nfor assessing chemical contamination in fish (USEPA, 2000). Composite samples of fish \n\nfillets (for predator) and whole fish (for bottom-dwelling), in a total of 5 individuals per \n\ncomposite, were wrapped in aluminium foil and frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored \n\nin a freezer (-18 \u00b0C) until analysis. Field samples (water, sediment and fish) were collected \n\nin summer, after the application of pesticides and in autumn, during the first seasonal \n\nrainfalls.  \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Analytical Methods \n\nBased on the farmer\u2019s information on the major pesticides used in the agricultural lands \n\nnear Lake Vela [e.g., Roundup\u00ae (formulated with glyphosate \u2013 360 gL\n-1\n\n)\n \nand Lasso\u00ae \n\n(formulated with alachlor \u2013 480 gL\n-1\n\n)] and considering the historic contamination, namely \n\nthe persistent pesticides that were used in the past, the several collected samples were \n\nanalysed for the presence of glyphosate, alachlor and organochlorine pesticides. The \n\nextraction procedure was carried out according to method no.3550B for Ultrasonic \n\nextraction published in the SW-846 manual (USEPA, 1996a). Concentrations of alachlor \n\nand organochlorine pesticides were determined by gas chromatography with an electron \n\ncapture detector (GC/ECD) (USEPA, 1995, 1996b) and glyphosate by high-performance \n\nliquid chromatography (HPLC) (USEPA, 1999). \n\n \n\n3.2.4. Assessing Potential Risks on Aquatic Life and Human Health \n\nConcentrations of pesticides in surface water were compared with the water quality \n\nguideline values (WQGV) fixed by USEPA (2006) for protection of freshwater species and \n\nwith the maximum admissible values (MAV) defined by the Portuguese legislation for \n\nsurface waters (MA, 1998). To evaluate potential hazards to human health, the \n\nconcentrations measured in groundwater were compared with the MAV established for \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n84 \n\ndrinking water according to the Portuguese legislation (MA, 1998) and compared with \n\nmaximum contaminant level (MCL) defined by American and Canadian guidelines for \n\ndrinking waters (HC, 2007; USEPA, 2007a). Since no Portuguese legislation exists, \n\nregarding the MAV for sediment, the concentrations of pesticides in sediment were only \n\ncompared with the sediment quality guideline values (SQGV) fixed by Canadian Council of \n\nMinisters of the Environment (CCME) to protect benthic-dwelling species (CCME, 2001).  \n\nHazard quotients (HQ) were calculated for surface water and sediment in order to \n\nevaluate potential risks to aquatic life, according to the equation 1:  \n\nHQ = (MC/LC50)\u00d71000                     (1), \n\nwhere MC is the highest measured concentration in the environment, LC50 is the lowest \n\nliterature LC50 for organisms inhabiting the water column and for sediment-dwelling \n\norganisms, and 1000 is the assessment factor applied when only short-term data is \n\navailable to ensure that substances with the potential to cause adverse effects are \n\nidentified, as defined by the Technical Guidance Document on Risk Assessment (EC, \n\n2003). For the aquatic compartment, at least one short-term test from each of three \n\ntrophic levels of the base-set (algae, daphnids and fish) was considered, and for the \n\nsediment compartment, at least one short-term test with sediment-dwelling organisms \n\nwas considered, according to EC (2003) recommendations. HQ higher than 1 indicates \n\nrisks of concerning effects on aquatic life. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Results and Discussion  \n\nPesticide residues were detected in the assessed compartments (water, sediment and fish \n\ntissues) (Figures III.2, III.3, III.4 and III.5), which confirmed the potential contamination of \n\nthe Lake Vela system by agricultural nonpoint sources of pollution. In general, the highest \n\nconcentrations were recorded in autumn which was related with seasonal rainfalls that \n\npromote the runoff and leaching of pesticides from the agricultural lands to the aquatic \n\nsystem. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n85 \n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n12.0\n\n14.0\n\n16.0\n\n18.0\n\n20.0\n\nSW1 SW2 SW3 SW4 SW5\n\nC\no\n\nn\nce\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\nL\n-1\n\n) \n\nSampling sites\n\nAlachlor\n\nMAV (0.5)\n\nWQGV (n.a.)\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n12.0\n\n14.0\n\n16.0\n\n18.0\n\n20.0\n\nSW1 SW2 SW3 SW4 SW5\nC\n\no\nn\n\nce\nn\n\ntr\na\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\ng\nL\n\n-1\n) \n\nSampling sites\n\nGlyphosate\n\nMAV (0.5)\n\nWQGV (n.a.)\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n12.0\n\n14.0\n\n16.0\n\n18.0\n\n20.0\n\nSW1 SW2 SW3 SW4 SW5\n\nC\no\n\nn\nce\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\nL\n-1\n\n) \n\nSampling sites\n\nDieldrin\n\nMAV (0.5)\nWQGV (0.24)\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\n10.0\n\n12.0\n\n14.0\n\n16.0\n\n18.0\n\n20.0\n\nSW1 SW2 SW3 SW4 SW5\n\nC\no\n\nn\nce\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\nL\n-1\n\n) \n\nSampling sites\n\nAldrin\n\nMAV (0.5)\n\nWQGV (3.0)\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\nGW1 GW2\n\nC\no\n\nn\nce\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\nL\n-1\n\n) \n\nSampling sites\n\nAlachlor\n\nMAV (0.1) \n\nMCL  (2.0)\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\nGW1 GW2\n\nC\no\n\nn\nce\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\nL\n-1\n\n) \n\nSampling sites\n\nAldrin\n\nMAV (0.1)\n\nMCL (0.7)\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\nGW1 GW2\n\nC\no\n\nn\nce\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\nL\n-1\n\n) \n\nSampling sites\n\nDieldrin\n\nMAV (0.1)\n\nMCL (0.7)\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\nGW1 GW2\n\nC\no\n\nn\nce\n\nn\ntr\n\na\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\ng\n\nL\n-1\n\n) \n\nSampling sites\n\nGlyphosate\n\nMAV (0.1)\n\nMCL (700)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure III.2.

Alachlor and glyphosate \n\nare the two most widely used herbicides in Portugal (Vieira, 2006) and are intensively \n\nused in the agricultural lands located in the drainage basin of Lake Vela (Abrantes, 2006a). \n\nThe insecticides aldrin and dieldrin were banned decades ago in most European \n\nCommunity countries, including in Portugal (MAPA, 1988), however they are still found in \n\nthe environment, as reported by recent studies in Europe (Neal et al., 2000; L\u00f3pez-Flores \n\net al., 2003; Gon\u00e7alves and Alpendurada, 2005, Peris et al., 2005). In fact, OCPs are \n\ncharacterized by low water solubility, high affinity to organic material and high half-life in \n\nsoil (Table III.1), and thus soil constitutes an important reservoir in which residues can \n\npersist for long periods of time (>7 yr) (Valle et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nTable III.1.

This evidence was expected due to the small area and shallow \n\ndepth of Lake Vela and due to the strong wind typical of the East Atlantic Coast that \n\ncontributes to the mixing and homogeneity of water. Nonetheless, SW2 and SW4 showed \n\nhigher concentrations of pesticides compared with the other sampling sites. As illustrated \n\nby Figure III.1, SW2 and SW4 are bordered by agricultural fields and therefore are directly \n\nexposed to agrochemicals that enter the lake through surface runoff.

Moreover, concentrations \n\nof aldrin in SW2, SW4 and SW5, and dieldrin in all samples exceed the WQGV for \n\nprotection of freshwater species (USEPA, 2006). Figure III.6a) shows that the risk \n\nthreshold of an HQ equal to 1 was largely exceeded in all samples for alachlor, aldrin and \n\ndieldrin, indicating potential risks for the aquatic biota of Lake Vela (Figure III.2).  \n\nWith the exception of alachlor, the detected pesticides (glyphosate, aldrin and \n\ndieldrin) have high log Koc values and therefore their leaching to groundwater is unlikely \n\n(Table III.1). Nevertheless, all of them were detected in groundwater samples (Figure \n\nIII.3). The sandy nature of agricultural soils (with high permeability and low organic \n\nmatter content) and the shallow depth of the groundwater are site-specific characteristics \n\nthat promote the leaching of agrochemicals and could explain the presence of slightly \n\nmobile pesticides in groundwater. Concentrations of alachlor, aldrin and dieldrin at GW1 \n\nand GW2 were above the MCLs for drinking water defined by HC (2007) and USEPA \n\n(2007a) guidelines (Figure III.3). Moreover, all concentrations were also above the \n\nregulatory allowable values defined by the Portuguese legislation for drinking water \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\n>\n>\n\n1\n \n\na) b) \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n89 \n\n(MAV=0.1 gL\n-1\n\n per single substance; MA, 1998). This evidence indicated that the use of \n\ngroundwater for drinking water purposes is likely to put risks to human health. EPA has \n\nfound that long-term exposure to alachlor potentially causes damages in the liver, kidney, \n\nspleen, nasal mucosa and eyes at levels above the MCL. Additionally, there exists \n\nevidence that alachlor is carcinogenic to humans for lifetime exposures at levels above \n\nthe MCL (USEPA, 2007b). Aldrin and dieldrin are highly toxic to humans, affecting the \n\ncentral nervous system and the liver. USEPA has classified aldrin and dieldrin as probable \n\nhuman carcinogens in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database (USEPA, \n\n2004). Glyphosate can cause kidney damage and reproductive effects for long term \n\nexposures above the MCL (USEPA, 2007c). Glyphosate was not classified as carcinogenic \n\nto humans (USEPA, 2004).  \n\nThe sediment samples collected in Lake Vela revealed a spatial variation in terms of \n\nthe contamination (Figure III.4). The insecticide dieldrin was detected in S2, S3 and S4 and \n\nthe herbicides alachlor and glyphosate were only detected in S2. In S1 and S5 pesticides \n\nwere not detected. Compared with water samples the concentrations of alachlor and \n\nglyphosate in S2 assume higher values (20.12 gL\n-1\n\n and 20.40? gL\n-1\n\n, respectively). On the \n\nother hand, lower concentrations of dieldrin were recorded in sediments when compared \n\nwith those registered in surface water samples. Considering sediments as a sink of \n\ncontaminants, whose concentrations may reach much higher levels than those in the \n\nupper water-column, and taking into account the high sorption coefficient of dieldrin \n\n(Table III.1), higher concentrations of this pesticide in sediments relatively to water can be \n\nexpected. Nevertheless, as the highest concentrations of dieldrin in water samples were \n\ndetected during the seasonal rainfalls in autumn, this observation could be explained by a \n\nrecent runoff of dieldrin from agricultural soils historically contaminated. The non-\n\ndetection of aldrin in sediment samples could be due to their transformation to dieldrin \n\nwhich, in turn, is more stable and highly persistent in the environment.  \n\nThe spatial variation observed in terms of the sediment contamination was \n\nconsistent with the characteristics of sediments and to the greater proximity of \n\nagricultural lands to the sampling sites. In general, sediments collected in the margin near \n\nagricultural fields, comparatively to sediments collected in the opposite margin, present a \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n90 \n\nhigher percentage of small size particles (silt and clay) and organic matter (Abrantes et al., \n\nnot published), which increases the adsorption of pesticides. In fact, the proximity of \n\nagricultural lands to the east and southeast margins of the lake is responsible for the \n\ninput of small size particles of soil through surface runoff and to the enrichment of \n\nsediments with organic matter (Figure III.1). Moreover, the margins bordered by \n\nagricultural fields are directly exposed to contamination from runoff, which is reflected in \n\nterms of the sediment contamination. \n\nAll the concentrations of aldrin detected in sediments were above the SQGV defined \n\nby CCME for the protection of aquatic life (CCME, 2001) (Figure III.4). Additionally, the HQ \n\ncalculated for alachlor in S2 and for dieldrin in S2, S3 and S4 were above 1 (Figure III.6b)), \n\nwhich confirms the potential risk for the sediment-dwelling organisms. \n\nThe chemical analysis performed on fish tissues showed that both species (the \n\npredator Micropterus salmoides and the bottom-feeding Cyprinus carpio), accumulated \n\nalachlor (Figure III.5). Nevertheless, the concentrations detected were below the \n\nconcentrations found in water and sediment. According to EC (2003), substances with a \n\nlog Kow?3, or that are highly adsorptive, and without mitigating properties (half\u2013life \n\nsuperior than 12h), are potentially bioaccumulable in organisms. Hence, regarding the \n\nproperties of the contaminants detected in water and sediment samples (Table III.1), it \n\nwas also expected the bioaccumulation of aldrin and dieldrin in fish tissues. In fact, OCPs \n\nbelong to a class of substances known to be of high lipophility and therefore have a great \n\npotential to accumulate in living organisms and to biomagnify in the food chain (Larson et \n\nal., 1997). The non bioaccumulation of aldrin and particularly dieldrin, whose \n\nconcentration detected in water was considerably high, could also indicate a recent input \n\nfrom the agricultural soil historically contaminated with OCPs. Considering the different \n\nhabitats and feeding strategies of the assessed fish species it was also expected to find \n\ndifferences in the contamination level. Predator species may biomagnify persistent \n\ncontaminants through several trophic levels of the food web and bottom-feeding species \n\nmay accumulate high contaminant concentrations through direct contact with \n\ncontaminated sediment or by feeding on sediment-dwelling organisms (USEPA, 2000). \n\nThe ingestion of contaminated fish from Lake Vela could represent a risk to ecological and \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n91 \n\nhuman receptors. Considering that top predators, such as otters and birds, are regular \n\nfish eating predators and that the transfer of contaminants through the food chain results \n\nin an increase of the bioconcentration in organisms at higher trophic levels, the \n\naccumulation of alachlor in fish tissues may result in toxic concentrations to top \n\npredators, also called secondary poisoning (EC, 2003). Regarding the human receptors, it \n\nwas not possible to ascertain if the consumption of fish from Lake Vela, represents a risk \n\nto human health because the amount of fish consumed per individual as well as the \n\nfrequency of intake are unknown.  \n\nEQGV were established with the purpose of protecting aquatic life and/or human \n\nhealth and are frequently used in the screening tier of ecological risk assessments (e.g., \n\nSuter, 1996; Chapman, 2000; Burton, 2002), being useful in the identification of \n\ncontaminants and areas of potential concern. Nevertheless, EQGVs should not be taken \n\nas thresholds of significant effects (Suter, 1996). In general, they differ greatly between \n\njurisdictions (Chapman, 2000) and may not reflect in situ conditions, disregarding the \n\nsynergistic/additive effects of chemical mixtures and the bioaccumulative effects that \n\nmay affect higher trophic levels (Burton, 2002). On the other hand, it is important to \n\nconsider that HQ suffers from a large uncertainty which results in an overprotective \n\nassessment, as it is difficult to interpret their real meaning in terms of the ecosystem \n\neffects (Villa et al., 2003). In this way, risk estimation should be based on a weight-of-\n\nevidence approach, i.e. they must be assessed in a holistic view in which multiple \n\ncomponents of the aquatic system are assessed (e.g., physical and chemical measures, \n\nbiological community structure, toxicity and bioaccumulation) through an integrated \n\nmethodology (Burton, 2002). In order to attain this purpose other studies were carried \n\nout on Lake Vela in order to include data from biological surveys (Abrantes et al., 2006b) \n\nwith ecotoxicological data derived for standard and local species (Abrantes et al., in \n\nprep.). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter III \n\n \n\n \n\n92 \n\n3.4. Conclusion \n\nExposure characterization is a fundamental step in an ecological risk assessment. The \n\npresent study confirmed the potential contamination of Lake Vela by pesticides from local \n\nagricultural activities. Results showed that aquatic organisms in Lake Vela as well as top \n\npredators and humans are exposed to currently and non-currently used pesticides, \n\nincluding OCPs banned decades ago. The measured concentrations in surface water and \n\nsediment and their comparison with benchmarks values indicated potential risks for \n\nwater column living organisms as well as sediment-dwelling species. Likewise, the levels \n\nof pesticides in groundwater were also above the safety values for drinking water \n\nindicating a potential public health problem for local residents. The accumulation of \n\nalachlor in predator and benthic fish species could also represent a risk to humans and \n\nparticularly to top predators, during their lifetime. Moreover it is also important to \n\nrecognize that human health safety can not be achieved without the protection of natural \n\nresources. This study, as the first exposure characterization performed on the Lake Vela \n\nsystem, constitutes valuable and useful information for the ERA process. However, this \n\npreliminary assessment of risks should be continued and confirmed through a weight-of-\n\nevidence approach. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5.

Hence, as part of an ecological risk assessment (ERA) this \n\nstudy aimed to use a whole sample toxicity assessment to evaluate the toxicity of water \n\nand sediments from Lake Vela on freshwater species. This way, standard (algae: \n\nPseudokirchneriella subcapitata; cladoceran: Daphnia magna) and local species (algae: \n\nAphanizomenon flos-aquae; cladoceran: Daphnia longispina) were exposed to water and \n\nsediment elutriates collected seasonally from two sites at Lake Vela: one in the east \n\nMargin (EM), near agricultural lands and, the other in the west margin (WM), surrounded \n\nby a pine tree forest. The results confirmed the seasonal contamination of both \n\nenvironmental compartments by pesticides, including organochlorine pesticides, and the \n\npresence of high concentrations of nutrients. Although both sites were contaminated, \n\nhigher levels of pesticides and nutrients were detected in EM, particularly in the \n\nsediments. Bioassays showed that water samples (100% concentration) collected in \n\nsummer and autumn significantly affected the growth rate of P. subcapitata, which could \n\nbe attributed to the presence of pesticides. Likewise they revealed an apparent toxicity of \n\nelutriates for P. subcapitata and for both daphnids, in summer and autumn. In fact, \n\nalthough pesticides were not detected in elutriates, high levels of un-ionized ammonia \n\nwere recorded, which is considered highly toxic to aquatic life. By comparing the several \n\nspecies, P. subcapitata was revealed to be the most sensitive one, followed by the \n\ndaphnids, and then by A. flos-aquae. Results obtained in this study underlined the \n\nimportance of whole samples toxicity assessment for characterizing the ecological effects \n\nof complex mixtures from diffuse inputs, in the ERA processes. \n\n \n\nKeywords \u2013 lakes; diffuse pollution; direct toxicity assessment, whole effluent tests, \nDaphnia longispina; Daphnia magna; Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; Aphanizomenon \nflos-aquae \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n102 \n\n \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\nDiffuse pollution constitutes an increasing problem all over the world and poses a \n\nsignificant challenge to risk assessors, regulators and managers, as it is difficult to \n\nmeasure and regulate (Loague et al., 1998; Howarth et al., 2000). Agriculture, through the \n\nuse of pesticides and fertilizers, is one of the main nonpoint sources of pollution (e.g., \n\nCarpenter et al., 1998; Ritter and Shirmohammadi, 2000; Arbuckle and Downing, 2001; \n\nHorwarth et al., 2002; Horwarth and Ramakrishma, 2005; Galbraith and Burns, 2007), \n\ncontributing to environmental degradation, particularly in freshwater and estuarine \n\necosystems. Additionally, intensive livestock farming practices are also recognized as a \n\nnonpoint source of nutrients to water bodies (Hooda et al., 2000).  \n\nLake Vela, located on the west coast of Portugal, is potentially exposed to \n\ncontamination generated by agricultural and livestock activities (Abrantes et al., 2006). \n\nThe lands are abundantly fertilized, and pesticides (e.g., herbicides) are commonly used. \n\nDue to the higher permeability of the agricultural soils, and their proximity to the water \n\nbody, those anthropogenic activities, through runoff or leaching, contribute to the \n\nimbalance of the aquatic ecosystem, namely with the higher input of nutrients, which \n\naccelerate the eutrophication process, and also the input of pesticides that could affect \n\nnon-target species. The frequent occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Vela, the \n\nlarge fish kills in recent years and the reduction in biodiversity, triggered the development \n\nof an ecological risk assessment (ERA) (Abrantes et al., 2006). This ERA defined, as a task, \n\nthe evaluation of the potential toxicity of diffuse pollution on different trophic levels. \n\nHence, the approach used in this study was a whole sample toxicity assessment, linking \n\ntoxicity bioassays and exposure information, as a tool for evaluating the impacts induced \n\nby diffuse pollution on algae and cladocerans species. Generally referred as WET (Whole \n\nEffluent Toxicity) tests in the USA or DTA (Direct Toxicity Assessment) in the UK, the \n\nwhole sample toxicity assessments can help to identify, diagnose and control impacts on \n\nthe ecosystem yielded by complex mixtures of contaminants (Wharfe, 2004; Wharfe et \n\nal., 2004; Whitehouse et al., 2004). Thereby, in this approach, all the present substances \n\nand their interactions are considered, which reduces the risks of under-protection and \n\npermits a more direct association between the source and the receptor (Whitehouse et \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n103 \n\n \n\nal., 2004). Although WET tests are not perfect tools, they are considered important \n\npredictive tools in the first stage of ERA hazard identification (Chapman, 2000). Moreover, \n\nthey can help to meet the aims and fill the gaps of the current water quality legislation \n\nand could be introduced in scenarios where common approaches are either inadequate \n\nor impractical (e.g., for complex mixtures) (Whitehouse, 2004). \n\nAccording to OECD (1998a), ERA should consider additional/alternative standardized \n\nbioassays using test species that complement the species commonly used. In this way, in \n\norder to increase the ecological relevance of the bioassays providing useful and reliable \n\ninformation about potential effects to resident species and to comparatively analyse \n\ndifferences in sensitivity between species, local (algae: Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; \n\ncladoceran: Daphnia longispina) as well as standard species (algae: Pseudokirchneriella \n\nsubcapitata; cladoceran: Daphnia magna) were used. Additionally, and considering the \n\nstudied water body as a whole system, we evaluated the toxicity of two different \n\ncompartments: water and sediment. For these purposes we have carried out adapted \n\nprotocols of general bioassays [Whole Effluent Toxicity Test (WET) and Elutriate Sediment \n\nToxicity Test (ESTT)]. Sediment elutriate tests were performed mainly to assess the \n\npotential contribution with contaminants given by sediments to the water column related \n\nwith dredging activities that occur regularly in Lake Vela (Abrantes, personal observation), \n\nand the subsequent effects on planktonic species. To obtain a holistic picture of the \n\ndiffuse pollution impacts and to perceive the influence of external factors, the spatial and \n\ntemporal variations of contamination in Lake Vela were also evaluated. \n\nIn summary, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of agricultural practices (diffuse \n\npollution) on the aquatic environment of Lake Vela using a combination of adapted whole \n\neffluent and elutriate bioassays with chemical analysis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n104 \n\n \n\n4.2. Material and Methods \n\n \n\n4.2.1. Study Site, Sampling Strategy and Storage \n\nLake Vela is a shallow eutrophic lake located in the littoral-centre of Portugal (40\u00ba5\u2019N \n\n8\u00ba8\u2019W, 45 m elevation) with a surface area of approximately 70 ha (Figure IV.1). It is part \n\nof a larger system commonly known as \u201cQuiaios Lakes\u201d, which is in parallel with the \n\ncoastline, on a sand dune plain, about 6 Km from the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered on the \n\nwest side by a pine tree forest, and on the east by agricultural fields, livestock farming \n\nand human settlements. Due to its ecological diversity Lake Vela was included in the \n\nEcological Net - Rede Natura 2000 \u2013 PTCON0055 (CM, 2000). The hydric regime of the \n\nlake is predominantly influenced by superficial and subterraneous fluxes (67% and 23%, \n\nrespectively), the remainder being attributed to rainfall (Fernandes, 1999). Due to the \n\nslope of the piezometric surface towards the lake depression, the fluxes are effectively \n\ndischarged into Lake Vela. On the east side of the drainage basin there are intensive \n\nagricultural and livestock farming activities. The main crop is corn for livestock feeding, \n\nwhose cultivation starts with land tillage in late April and continues until September, \n\nwhen corn is harvested.  \n\nThe collection of samples (water and sediment) was performed in two sites: one in \n\nthe east margin (EM), near agricultural lands and affected by direct runoff; and the other \n\nin the west margin (WM), where agricultural lands are absent (Figure IV.1). Furthermore, \n\nto assess temporal variations, the samples were collected seasonally, one sample per \n\nseason. Subsurface water samples were collected directly to 5 L glass flasks for \n\nenvironmental parameters analyses and for bioassays, following the USEPA \n\nrecommendations (USEPA, 2002). Sediment samples were collected according the USEPA \n\nguidelines (USEPA, 2001) using a stainless steal corer and transferred into storage \n\ncontainers specially prepared for pesticide analysis and bioassays. At the laboratory, the \n\nsediment samples were homogenised and sieved in a 2 mm mesh size sieve. Until further \n\nprocessing, water and sediment samples were stored in the dark at 4\u00baC (maximum \n\nstorage time: 1 week). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n105 \n\n \n\n \n\n500 m   \n\nArboreal vegetation \nShrubby vegetation \nAgricultural fields \nHuman settlements \n\nLake Vela    \n\nStables   \n\n  \n\n  N   \n\nLisbon   \n\nOporto     \n\nFigueira  \nda Foz   \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\nP\nO\n\nR\nT\n\nU\nG\n\nA\nL \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.1. Sampling sites in Lake Vela. EM- east margin, WM \u2013 west margin. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Analytical Methods \n\nSimultaneously to field sampling, parameters such as water temperature, pH, \n\nconductivity and dissolved oxygen were determined in situ by using portable water \n\ntesting meters (WTW 340-A pH meter, WTW LF 330 conductivity meter and WTW OXI 320 \n\noxygen meter). Secchi disk was also used to measure water transparency. In the \n\nlaboratory, the total suspended solids (TSS) in water, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) were \n\ndetermined according to APHA (1995). A qualitative analysis of phytoplankton was \n\nperformed in water samples fixed in formol (5% v/v) to depict the presence of \n\ncyanobacteria blooms (e.g., A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa). \n\nSediment samples were characterized in terms of their particle size distribution, \n\norganic matter content (OM) and pH, following the methodologies described by \n\nBuchanan and Kain (1971). \n\nBased on the information of farmers on the major pesticides used in the agricultural \n\nlands near Lake Vela [e.g., Roundup\u00ae (formulated with glyphosate \u2013 360 gL\n-1\n\n)\n \nand Lasso\u00ae \n\n(formulated with alachlor \u2013 480 gL\n-1\n\n)] and considering that persistent pesticides were \n\nused in the past, water, sediment and elutriate samples were screened for the presence \n\nEM \n\nWM \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n106 \n\n \n\nof alachlor, glyphosate and organochlorine pesticides. Concentrations of alachlor and \n\norganochlorine pesticides were determined by gas chromatography with an electron \n\ncapture detector (GC/ECD) (USEPA, 1995, 1996) and concentrations of glyphosate by \n\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (USEPA, 1999a). \n\nAt the onset of the bioassays, soluble reactive phosphorus (ascorbic acid method; \n\nPO4\n3-\n\n), un-ionized ammonia (Nessler method; NH3-N), nitrates (cadmium reduction \n\nmethod; NO3-N) and nitrites (calorimetric method; NO2-N) concentrations were measured \n\nin water and elutriate according to methodologies described by Lind (1979) and APHA \n\n(1995). \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Water and Elutriate Preparation \n\nWater samples were filtered through a 60 m mesh size plankton net for assays with \n\ncladocerans and through a glass fibre filter (Whatman GF/C) with 0.45 m of pore \n\ndiameter for assays with algae, as recommended by USEPA guidelines (USEPA, 2002). \n\nElutriates were prepared according to the procedures described in Ankley et al. (1991) \n\nand Nebeker et al. (1984). Sediments were mixed with MBL medium (elutriate a) for the \n\nassays with algae and mixed with ASTM hard water medium (elutriate b) for the assays \n\nwith cladocerans, in a ratio of 1:4 (sediment/medium). The mixture was shaken at 200 \n\nr.p.m for 2 h in an orbital shaker and, after a 12 h sedimentation period at a temperature \n\nof 4\u00baC, it was centrifuged at 5000 r.p.m for 15 minutes. The liquid fraction was removed \n\nby decantation and filtered in the same conditions, as aforementioned for the water \n\nsamples. Water and elutriate samples were stored in the dark at 4\u00baC up to the testing \n\ntime, but never exceeding one week. \n\n \n\n4.2.4. Culture of Test Species \n\nUnialgal inoculum cultures of P. subcapitata and A. flos-aquae (being the latter isolated \n\nfrom a sample collected in Lake Vela a few years ago) were maintained in 250 mL \n\nErlenmeyer flasks with 100 mL of sterilized Woods Hole MBL medium, at 20\u00b12 \u00b0C and with \n\na 16h\nL\n:8h\n\nD\n photoperiod. To start new cultures, algae were harvested in the exponential \n\ngrowth phase (5\u20137 days old) and inoculated in fresh medium. \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n107 \n\n \n\nMonoclonal cultures of D. magna (clone A, sensu Baird et al., 1989a) and D. \n\nlongispina (isolated from a sample collected in Lake Vela a few years ago) were \n\ncontinuously reared under a 16h\nL\n:8h\n\nD\n cycle and a temperature of 20\u00b12 \u00b0C, in synthetic \n\nASTM hardwater medium (ASTM, 1996) supplied with an organic additive extracted from \n\nthe algae Ascophyllum nodosum (Baird et al., 1989b). Cultures were renewed every other \n\nday and the organisms were fed with P. subcapitata at a rate of 3.0x10\n5\n cells/mL/day and \n\n1.5x10\n5\n cells/mL/day for D. magna and D. longispina, respectively. \n\n \n\n4.2.5. Assays with Algae \n\nBioassays were conducted according to USEPA (2002) and OECD (2002) guidelines. The \n\nalgae were exposed during a 96 h period to several dilutions of water or elutriate (12.5, \n\n25.0, 50.0, 75.0 and 100.0%) in MBL medium. Assays were performed in 100 ml glass vials \n\nfilled with 40 ml of test medium, using a total of three replicate per each treatment and \n\ncontrol. Test vials were incubated under constant agitation (~100 r.p.m in an orbital \n\nshaker) and in the same conditions of algal cultures, with an initial cell density of \n\napproximately 10\n4\n cells.mL\n\n?1\n (inoculated from the exponential-growing batch culture). In \n\norder to exclude any potential effects from nutrient deficiency promoted by dilutions, \n\nadditional controls were tested using MBL medium diluted with distilled water at \n\nconcentrations of 12.5, 25, 50 and 75%. At the end of the bioassay, the cells density was \n\ndetermined as a biomass parameter. The growth rate (day\n-1\n\n) and percentage of growth \n\ninhibition (% I) were calculated from cells density measurements.  \n\n \n\n4.2.6. Assays with Cladocerans \n\nSub-lethal assays with cladocerans (D.magna and D. longispina) followed OECD (1998b) \n\nand USEPA (2002) guidelines. Water and elutriate samples were tested at several \n\ndilutions (12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0 and 100.0%) performed with ASTM. Bioassays were \n\ninitiated with neonates (<24h-old), born between the 3\nrd\n\n and \n5th\n\n broods, obtained from \n\nthe bulk group cultures. For each treatment and control, 10 replicates were used. The \n\norganisms were exposed individually, in 100ml glass beakers, whose test medium was \n\nchanged every two days. Organisms were fed daily with P. subcapitata at a rate of 3.0x10\n5\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n108 \n\n \n\ncells/ml/day and 1.5x10\n5\n cells/ml/day for D. magna and D. longispina, respectively, \n\nsupplied with an organic additive. Dissolved oxygen and pH were monitored throughout \n\nthe test for validation purposes. Test vessels were checked daily and neonates, when \n\npresent, were counted and removed. Survival, growth, fecundity (number of neonates), \n\nthe age at the first reproduction and the number of broods, were the endpoints assessed \n\nin these assays The test finished after 60%, or more, of the control females have released \n\ntheir third brood (USEPA 2002). The body length of females was estimated at the \n\nbeginning and at the end of the test, by extrapolation from moult exopodite length \n\n(Pereira et al., 2004), allowing calculation of the somatic growth rate of the females (SGR, \n\nday\n-1\n\n). Fecundity, survival and age at each brood release were integrated in the \n\ncalculation of the rate of population increase (r, day\n-1\n\n) using the Euler-Lotka equation \n\n(Meyer et al., 1986). According to Forbes and Calow (1999) r is a better measure of \n\nresponses to toxicants than are individual-level effects because it integrates potentially \n\ncomplex interactions of life-history traits, providing a more relevant measure of ecological \n\nimpact. The Jack-knife technique was used to calculate standard errors for r (Meyer et al., \n\n1986).  \n\n \n\n4.2.7. Statistical Analysis \n\nOne-way-ANOVA, followed by a Dunnett test, was used to assess significant differences \n\n(p<0.05) in the endpoints assessed between each lake water dilution and each elutriate \n\ndilution and the control (Zar, 1996). Probit regression analysis (Finney, 1971) was used to \n\ncalculate the IC50 (96h) and IC10 (96h) for algae growth inhibition and the EC50 and EC10 for \n\ndaphnids SGR and r. The different test parameters are reported as percentages of water \n\nor elutriate in the dillution medium.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3. Results and Discussion  \n\nThe present study evaluated the sub-lethal toxicity of water and sediment elutriate \n\nsamples from a lake exposed to diffuse pollution (Lake Vela, Portugal) on algae and \n\ncladocerans species. The toxicity evaluation was based in a whole sample toxicity \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n109 \n\n \n\nassessment and the toxicity bioassays were complemented with the physical and \n\nchemical characterization of the environmental samples tested. \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Characterization of Exposure \n\nThe chemical analyses performed on the water and sediment samples confirmed the \n\npotential contamination of Lake Vela by diffuse pollution from agricultural and livestock \n\nactivities, illustrated mainly by the high amounts of nutrients and by the presence of \n\npesticides (Tables IV.I and IV.II).  \n\nAs expected, a seasonal variation in the concentrations of contaminants was \n\nobserved in both compartments (water and sediment), which could be associated to the \n\nseasonal agricultural activity and to the climatic factors, such as rainfall events. Moreover, \n\nby comparing the two sampling sites (WM and EM) a spatial variation of nutrients and \n\npesticide concentrations in elutriates and sediment samples, respectively, was also \n\nevident, with higher values in the margin surrounded by agricultural lands (EM).  \n\nNutrients in water samples showed their highest values, generally, in the winter \n\nsampling period, especially the nitrate and orthophosphate ions (Table IV.1). In fact, \n\nrainfall intensification in autumn and winter months (Figure IV.2), associated with the \n\nLake Vela topography and sandy nature of the soil [with high permeability and low \n\ndenitrification potential (Abrantes et al., submitted)] promoting the leaching and runoff \n\nof nutrients from the adjacent agricultural fields to the lake basin. According to local \n\nfarmers, the lands are highly fertilized with commercial fertilizers and livestock manures \n\n(personal communication). In fact, the high nutrient contents, especially N and P \n\ncompounds, associated with the high values of Chl a, the reduced water transparency and \n\nthe presence of cyanobacterial blooms (e.g., A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa) (Table \n\nIV.1), confirmed the advanced trophic state of Lake Vela, classified as \n\neutrophic/hypertrophic lake, according to N\u00fcrnberg (1996). Antunes et al. (2003) \n\nreported that Lake Vela is now more eutrophic than 10 years ago.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n110 \n\n \n\nTable IV.1.

All concentrations detected were \n\ngreater than the allowable maximal limits (0.5 gL\n-1\n\n per single substance) defined for \n\nsurface waters by the Portuguese legislation (MA, 1998). Alachlor and glyphosate are the \n\ntwo most widely used herbicides in Portugal (Vieira, 2006) including in the agricultural \n\nlands near Lake Vela (Abrantes, 2006). Though the use of insecticides with aldrin and \n\ndieldrin as active ingredients was banned decades ago in most of the European \n\nCommunity countries including Portugal (MAPA, 1988), they can still be found in the \n\nenvironment, particularly the dieldrin.

The presence of pesticides either in Lake Vela \n\nsurface water or sediment was only reported in summer and autumn, with the highest \n\nconcentrations recorded in autumn. This seasonality is certainly associated to agricultural \n\npractices and meteorological events. The major application of pesticides takes place in \n\nMay with the use of Lasso\u00ae and/or Roundup\u00ae as pre-emergent herbicides. Roundup\u00ae is \n\nalso used later for pre-harvest control (Abrantes et al., 2006). During the summer, the \n\nirrigation of agricultural fields is the main factor promoting the runoff and leaching of \n\npesticides, while in autumn the inputs of pesticides are certainly related to the high levels \n\nof precipitation recorded before the samples collection (Figure IV.2). The depicted \n\npesticides were detected in both water samples (EM and WM), which reveals the \n\ndispersion of contaminants throughout the whole water body. Nonetheless, the pesticide \n\nconcentrations in the water samples from the margin adjacent to agricultural lands (EM) \n\nare slightly more elevated than the concentrations recorded in the opposite one (WM). \n\nRegarding sediment samples there is a clear variation of pesticide concentrations \n\nbetween them, which are absent or below the limit of detection in WM samples (Table \n\nIV.2). This variation was consistent with the characteristics of sediments. In general, the \n\nsediment collected in EM compared with the sediment collected in WM, presented a \n\ngreater percentage of small size particles and organic matter (Table IV.1), which promote \n\nthe higher adsorption of pesticides. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.2.

Considering that ESTT is an effective \n\nmethod of evaluating the potential toxicity of contaminants that are exchanged between \n\nthe sediment and the aqueous phase during dredging processes (Ankley et al., 1992) and \n\nthat all samples were kept in the dark, under refrigerated conditions, this study reveals \n\nthe strong adsorption of pesticides to sediment particles, and the low risk for aquatic life \n\nassociated to water contamination by pesticides due to a dredging process or sediment \n\nressuspension \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Assays with Algae \n\nFigure IV.3 shows the effects of water and elutriate samples on the growth rate of the \n\ngreen algae P. subcapitata and the cyanobacteria A. flos-aquae. A considerable difference \n\nin sensitivity was observed between the two species. The growth of P. subcapitata was \n\nsignificantly inhibited (p &lt;0.001) by samples collected in summer and autumn at higher \n\nconcentrations. On the other hand, a stimulation in the growth rate of A. flos-aquae was \n\nobserved under intermediate concentrations and no significant inhibitory effects (p>0.05) \n\nwere observed when exposed to higher concentrations. In fact, although little is known \n\nabout the effects of pesticides on cyanobacteria, some studies have shown that they are \n\nless sensitive than green algae (e.g., Fairchild et al., 1998; Sabater and Carrasco, 2001; Ma \n\net al., 2004, 2006).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n114 \n\n \n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\nC 12.5 25 50 75 100\n\nConcentration (%)\n\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\nC 12.5 25 50 75 100\n\nConcentration (%)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.3.

In \n\nfact, by comparing the concentrations of pesticides measured in water samples with the \n\ntoxicological benchmarks for algae, it was observed that the concentrations of alachlor \n\nwere close to the IC50 values reported for P. subcapitata in literature [e.g., Fairchild et al. \n\n(1998): IC50 (96h)=10 gL\n-1\n\n; Tomlin (2000): IC50 (72h)=12 gL\n-1\n\n; Monsanto Company \n\n(2002): IC50 (96h)=2.9 gL\n-1\n\n]. Moreover, the toxic effects were not due to depletion of \n\nnutrients because controls with different dilutions of MBL with distilled water performed \n\nsimilarly.  \n\nBoth water samples (WM and EM), collected in summer and autumn affected \n\nnegatively the P. subcapitata growth, with a significant growth inhibition relative to \n\ncontrol in the 100% concentration (p<0.001) (Figure IV.3).

Although the contaminants \n\nwere dispersed throughout the whole water body (Tables IV.1 and IV.2), the site EM was \n\npotentially more affected due to the proximity of the agricultural lands. Besides the \n\ncontaminants, the biological interactions are also important factors that constrain the \n\nperformance of organisms. Studies developed by de Figueiredo et al. (2006) in Lake Vela \n\ndemonstrate the inhibitory effects of bloom-forming cyanobacteria (e.g., A. flos-aquae \n\nand M. aeruginosa) towards some algae and their implications in phytoplankton \n\ndynamics. It is known that many cyanobacteria are toxic to many organisms, namely \n\nmicroalgae (Kearns and Hunter, 2001; Singh et al., 2001; Suikkanen et al., 2004). Blooms \n\nof cyanobacteria, including the species present in Lake Vela, produce toxins and have \n\nsemi-chemical properties (Downing et al., 2001). In this way, the inhibitory effects \n\nreported for P. subcapitata could also be related to the presence of toxins or allelopathic \n\ncompounds produced by the algal blooms observed in summer (Table IV.1).  \n\n \n\nTable IV.3.

Regarding the nutrient concentrations (Table IV.1) it is noticeable \n\nthe high concentrations of un-ionized ammonia (NH3-N) recorded in elutriates, namely in \n\nthe summer and autumn samples, and although ammonia is a nitrogen source for algae, \n\nat high concentrations may be adverse for some algae species (K\u00e4llqvist and Svenson, \n\n2003, Mucha et al., 2003). In fact, ammonia has been considered a confounding factor in \n\nsediment toxicology (Lapota et al., 2000; Postma et al., 2002; Losso et al., 2007), with un-\n\nionized ammonia being the most toxic form to aquatic environments (Camargo and \n\nAlonso, 2006).  \n\nThe presence of algal blooms in Lake Vela is frequently associated with an increase in \n\nwater temperature during the warm season and with anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, \n\nparticularly nitrogen and phosphorus (de Figueiredo et al., 2006). Nevertheless, the low \n\nsensitivity showed by A. flos-aquae to pesticides, relative to the green algae, can also \n\ncontribute to their massive growth and dominance. \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Assays with Cladocerans \n\nThe results of bioassays with D. magna and D. longispina are illustrated in Figures IV.4, \n\nIV.5 and Table IV.3. In general, despite the seasonal contamination of water by pesticides, \n\nparticularly by the insecticides aldrin and dieldrin (Table IV.2), no significant toxic effects \n\n(p > 0.05) on growth and reproduction of both daphnids were observed. Moreover, \n\nstimulation was observed in the population growth rate (r) for several bioassays, which \n\ncould be related to the presence of dissolved nutritive particles and edible algae in water \n\nsamples. Additionally, toxicity due to the presence of harmful cyanobacteria blooms (e.g., \n\nA. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa) recorded in the summer was excluded, as the daphnids \n\nperformed well when submitted to water collected in this period.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n117 \n\n \n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\nC 12.5 25 50 75 100\n\nConcentration (%)\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\nC 12.5 25 50 75 100\n\nConcentration (%)\n\n0.00\n\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.30\n\n0.40\n\n0.50\n\n0.60\n\nC 12.5 25 50 75 100\n\nConcentration (%)\n\n0.00\n\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.30\n\n0.40\n\n0.50\n\n0.60\n\nC 12.5 25 50 75 100\n\nConcentration (%)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure IV.4.

Error bars indicate the standard error and asterisks indicate significant \n\ndifferences between the treatment and the control (p<0.05).  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe apparent toxicity exhibited for both daphnids when exposed to elutriate EM at \n\n100% concentration in summer and autumn (Figures IV.4 and IV.5), was congruent with \n\nthe results obtained for P. subcapitata. In fact, as above mentioned to algae, although any \n\npesticides were detected in elutriates, the toxicity could be related to the high values of \n\nun-ionized ammonia (around 2 mgL\n-1\n\n) recorded in elutriate b, which are above the \n\nrecommended concentrations of ammonia (0.05 to 0.35 mg.L\n-1\n\n NH3-N for short-term \n\nexposures and 0.01 to 0.02 mgL\n-1\n\n NH3-N for long-term exposures) defined by the USEPA \n\nwater quality criteria for ammonia to protect the aquatic animals (USEPA, 1986, 1999b). \n\nData on toxicity associated with the elutriate EM in summer and autumn showed that \n\nboth parameters (SGR and r) were significantly affected (p<0.001) in the 100% elutriate \n\n(Figures IV.4 and IV.5). In fact, toxic chemicals reduce the SGR of neonates and cause an \n\nearly maturation and a subsequent reduction in fecundity (Hanazato, 1998, 1999), which, \n\nin turn, is reflected in population growth rate (r). \n\nThe outcome of exposures to several water and elutriate samples did not allow a \n\nclear distinction between daphnid species regarding, in general, their tolerance or \n\nsensitiveness. Nonetheless, compared with algae bioassays, it was possible to establish \n\nthe following decreasing order of sensitivity: P. subcapitata > daphnids > A. flos-aquae.  \n\nAlthough the presence of contaminants in Lake Vela seemed not to affect the fitness \n\nof daphnids in the laboratory, it is important to consider the potential toxic effects on \n\nother related trophic levels, especially in primary producers. In this way, effects in edible \n\nalgae, as reported for P. subcapitata, could indirectly affect their consumers, namely \n\ndaphnids and, subsequently, all the food-web through a bottom-up mechanism. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n119 \n\n \n\n4.4. Conclusion \n\nThis study has showed that anthropogenic activities, such as agriculture and livestock, are \n\naffecting the quality of Lake Vela and represent a potential threat to the aquatic life. \n\nResults confirm the potential contamination of water and sediment by diffuse \n\npollution, expressed by the presence of pesticides, including OCPs, and higher \n\nconcentrations of nutrients. As expected, it was observed a seasonal variation of \n\ncontaminants in both environmental compartments, which could be associated to the \n\nseasonal agricultural practices and to the meterological factors, such as periods of more \n\nabundant rainfall. Moreover, by comparing the two sampling sites (WM and EM) there is \n\nalso an evident spatial variation of nutrient and pesticide concentrations in sediment \n\nsamples, with the highest values recorded in the margin surrounded by agricultural lands \n\n(EM).  \n\nThe outcome of bioassays indicated that lake water samples (at 100%) collected in \n\nsummer and autumn significantly affected the growth rate of the green algae P. \n\nsubcapitata, which could be due to the presence of pesticides, namely the herbicide \n\nalachlor. Likewise, there was an apparent toxicity associated to the elutriate EM (at 100%) \n\nfor P. subcapitata and for both daphnids, affecting their growth and reproduction. \n\nAlthough pesticides were not found in elutriates, high levels of un-ionized ammonia were \n\nrecorded which are considered highly toxic to aquatic life. By comparing the several \n\nspecies responses, P. subcapitata revealed to be the most sensitive one, followed by the \n\ndaphnids, and then by A. flos-aquae. Thus, this study reveals that the low sensitivity to \n\npesticides showed by the local cyanobacteria A. flos-aquae comparatively to the green \n\nalgae may represent an important advantage in field and could contribute to their \n\nmassive growth and dominance in summer. Furthermore, emphasises should be placed \n\non the use of local species besides the standard ones, as a way to provide more \n\necologically relevant information on potential toxic effects. At last, this study highlights \n\nthe importance of whole samples toxicity assessment for a more relevant evaluation of \n\nthe toxicity of complex mixtures from diffuse inputs in the ERA processes. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter IV \n\n120 \n\n \n\n4.5.

This study was carried out in order to understand the seasonal \n\nvariation of Lake Vela\u2019s phytoplankton and cladoceran communities and their interactions \n\nunder advanced eutrophic conditions. When comparing our results with general models \n\nof plankton succession observed in other temperate and tropical lakes we found some \n\ncoherence between several seasonal events. Our results suggest that phytoplankton is \n\nmainly regulated by nutrients (\u201cbottom-up\u201d effect). However, the warm mediterranean \n\ntemperatures had an important role in the phytoplankton succession, being responsible \n\nfor the rapid and intense Cyanobacteria development in spring and summer. Our work \n\nalso demonstrated that phytoplankton is one of the main factors responsible for the \n\nseasonal structure of the community of cladocerans, which are well related to changes in \n\nalgae diversity and abundance, being the Cyanobacteria having major impact. Moreover, \n\nthe occurrence of a massive Cyanobacteria bloom during the study, which induced anoxia \n\nand consequent fish kill, enhanced the structuring role that fish have on the cladoceran \n\nseasonal succession and the effects of this episode in the normal seasonal succession of \n\nplankton.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey words: eutrophication; cladocerans; phytoplankton; trophic relationships; shallow \n\nlake \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n132 \n\n5.1. Introduction \n\nThe relationship between zooplankton and phytoplankton is an important base of the \n\nfood web in lakes. The abundance and diversity of phytoplankton and zooplankton vary in \n\nfreshwater bodies according to their limnological features and trophic state (Jensen et al., \n\n1994; Jepessen et al., 2000; 2002; 2003). When nutrient loading is low, lakes present a \n\nclearwater phase with low algae biomass and a dense community of submerged \n\nmacrophytes. On the other hand, the increase of nutrient loads in lakes may be \n\nresponsible for an increase of the phytoplankton biomass. As the primary producers \n\ncommunity undergoes changes, the structure of communities along the trophic web is \n\nsubsequently affected. The phytoplankton increase leads to the high turbidity of water, \n\nwhich in turn, may contribute to the depletion of the submerged macrophytes \n\ncommunity (Freedman, 1989; Caraco, 1993; Klinge et al., 1995). This fact enables changes \n\nin community structure, as it reduces plant surface area for algal fixation, the habitat and \n\nrefuge for zooplankton, macroinvertebrates and fishes, as well as impairing the slow-\n\ngrowing biomass of macrophytes, which is responsible for long term storage of nutrients \n\nby removing them from water column and sediment (McDougal and Goldsborough, \n\n1996). Moreover, some algae taxa that respond more swiftly than others to increase in \n\nnutrients, as Cyanobacteria, are favoured. It is known that Cyanobacteria are low quality \n\nfood for zooplankton, due to their filamentous or colonial structure, low digestibility and \n\ntoxin production, inducing limitations to the growth and reproduction of zooplanktonic \n\norganisms (e.g., Arnold, 1971; Haney, 1987; Lampert, 1987; Reinikainen et al., 1994; \n\nRepka, 1996; 1997; DeMott, 1999; DeMott et al., 2001; Rohrlack et al., 2001; Ghadouani \n\net al., 2003). Ultimately, the increase of nutrient concentrations can promote the massive \n\ngrowth of phytoplankton, which eventually die and are decomposed by microorganisms \n\nthat are responsible for the elevated rates of organic matter decomposition and the \n\nsubsequent anoxia, leading to large kills of fish and other aquatic life (Br\u00f6nmark and \n\nWeisner, 1992).  \n\nZooplankton represents the channel of transmission of the energy flux from the \n\nprimary producers to the top consumers, because they include the primary herbivores \n\nand are important diet items for fish and other predators. In particular, cladocerans are \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n133 \n\nan important constituent of most lake zooplankton communities, due to their capability \n\nto filter all particles within a given size range, including bacteria, protozoa, detritus and \n\nalgae (Lampert, 1978; Infante and Litt, 1985; De Bernardi et al., 1987; Hessen \n\nand.Andersen, 1990; Brendelberger, 1991; M\u00fcller-Navarra and Lampert, 1996; \n\nGreenwood et al., 1999; H\u00fclsmann, 2001). Hence, these organisms are faced with a great \n\ndiversity of resources of different quality and since their capacity of selection is limited, \n\nthe quality and quantity of food are determinants in the life history of cladocerans \n\n(Lampert, 1978; M\u00fcller-Navarra and Lampert, 1996; Greenwood et al., 1999; H\u00fclsmann, \n\n2001). On the other hand, in addition to nutrient conditions, it is known that the \n\nzooplankton can affect the composition and abundances of phytoplankton species, both \n\nby direct grazing (Shapiro, 1995) and by altering the nutrient conditions through nutrient \n\nregeneration (Carney and Elser, 1990). \n\nLake Vela is a shallow polymictic lake situated in the West coast of Portugal, which is \n\nlocated in the Mediterranean-iberoatlantic group of the Mediterranean region, where the \n\nclimate is influenced by the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean. Due to Lake Vela\u2019s \n\nstrategical-geographic position it is considered as a protected zone with high \n\nconservational interest. Thereby, it was classified as a first level protection natural area \n\nand it benefits the protection statute defined by the Bi\u00f3topos Project of Corine \n\nProgramme 85/338/CEE, of 27 June (Farinha and Trindade, 1994). However, Lake Vela \n\nwatershed shows intense agricultural and livestock activities on the East site. Due to the \n\nsandy nature of soils and the small depth of the groundwater (Fernandes, 1999), the \n\ndrainage basin of Lake Vela is potentially exposed to loads of nutrients generated by \n\nthese activities. Thus, this lake is classified as eutrophic since 1960 (Nauwerck, 1960), \n\nshowing high N and P levels typical of eutrophic systems (Barros, 1994; Pereira, 1997, \n\nFernandes, 1999; Abrantes, 2002; Antunes et al., 2003). The increase of phytoplankton \n\nbiomass, with the presence of algal blooms, the depletion of submerged macrophytes, \n\nthe increase in turbidity, and a subsequent reduction in biodiversity are some of the \n\ncharacteristics associated with the eutrophication process in Lake Vela that could \n\ncompromise its wildlife and recreational use. \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n134 \n\nAlthough general hypotheses and patterns of plankton succession were well \n\ndescribed in temperate dimictic lakes (Sommer et al., 1986), there is still very few studies \n\nassessing plankton succession patterns in shallow lakes with Mediterranean climate, \n\npolymictic thermal regime and extreme eutrophic conditions associated to Cyanobacteria \n\nblooms. Thus, this study constitutes a complement for previous works, namely works on \n\nplankton seasonal succession, as PEG model. Furthermore, to contribute for the \n\nmanagement of the Lake Vela system and the activities in its drainage basin it is \n\nimportant to understand the behaviour and linkages between the trophic levels under \n\nadvanced trophic conditions. Thus, we aim to study the structure and the seasonal \n\nchanges of the primary producers and herbivorous cladocerans and their \n\ninterdependency in the eutrophic polymictic Lake Vela.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2. Material and Methods \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Study Description \n\nLake Vela, located in the littoral-centre of Portugal (40\u00ba5\u00b4N 8\u00ba8\u00b4W, 45 m elevation), is a \n\ntemperate shallow lake (mean depth =0.9 m, maximum depth =2.4 m) with 70 ha of \n\nfloodable surface area and a total volume of 70 10\n4\n m\n\n3\n. It is surrounded in the East side \n\nby agricultural fields and some human settlements and, in the West side, by a forest road, \n\nwhich is separated from the lake by pine trees (Pinus pinaster) and acacias (Acacia spp.). \n\nDue to the regular nutrient inputs, the lake is highly eutrophic. It is characterised by a \n\npermanently turbid water, without a spring clear water phase, and algal blooms are \n\nfrequently observed, namely in the warmer seasons. The phytoplankton is typically \n\ndominated by Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyceae (e.g., Cyclotella spp.) and coccoid \n\nChlorophyta (Barros, 1994). The macrophyte community is characterised by the \n\ndominance of Cladium mariscus, Myriophyllum verticillatum, Nymphaea alba and species \n\nfrom Poaceae family (Pereira, 1997). However, nearly 80-90% of the flooded lake bed \n\ndoes not contain any vegetation (Fernandes, 1999). The major crustacean species \n\nrecorded are Daphnia longispina, Ceriodaphnia pulchella and Bosmina longirostris \n\n(Antunes et al., 2003). Fish are also abundant, with prevalent species such as: Lepomis \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n135 \n\ngibbosus, Gambusia holbrooki and Micropterus salmoides, which are all introduced \n\nspecies. \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Physico-chemical Analysis \n\nSamples were collected bimonthly near surface (0.4 m in average) in the pelagic zone of \n\nthe lake, over a one-year period. For chemical analysis (alkalinity, hardness and \n\nnutrients), chlorophyll a and suspended solids, water samples were collected with a 1.5 L \n\nplastic bottle and transported to the lab in the dark, at 4\u00baC. Until further processing, the \n\nsamples for chemical analysis were preserved at \u201320\u00baC. Chlorophyll a was measured after \n\ncollection on glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C) and extraction in 90% acetone in the \n\ndark, following APHA. (1995). Likewise, for suspended solids analysis, samples were \n\nfiltered through pre-weighed filters (Whatman GF/C) and the solids (volatile and fixed) \n\nwere calculated according to APHA. (1995). Hardness and alkalinity were determined \n\nthrough buret titration methods. Ammonia was determined by Nessler method, nitrites \n\nby a colorimetric method, nitrates by cadmium reduction method and soluble reactive \n\nphosphorous (SRP) by the ascorbic acid method, following APHA (1995) procedures. \n\nSimultaneously to field sampling, temperature, pH (WTW 340-A pH meter), dissolved \n\noxygen (WTW OXI 320 oxygen meter) and conductivity (WTW LF 330 conductivity meter) \n\nwere recorded subsuperficially.  \n\n \n\n5.2.3. Biological Parameters \n\nFor phytoplankton a 1 L sample were preserved in lugol (1% v/v) for later identification \n\nand enumeration. The identification of phytoplankton species was made by observation \n\nthrough a light microscope using different references for Cyanobacteria (Geitler, 1932; \n\nKom\u00e1rek and Anagnostidis, 1999), Bacillariophyceae (Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1986-\n\n1991) and Chlorophyta (Chlorococcales) (Kom\u00e1rek and Fott, 1983). The enumeration was \n\nperformed according to Lund et al. (1958) with at least 400 cells counted. For cladoceran \n\nanalysis, three replicate samples were collected and concentrated by filtration through a \n\n55 \u00b5m mesh screen until significant clogging occurred. Each nylon screen was \n\nimmediately placed in 4% sugar-formalin for zooplankton preservation (Haney and Hall, \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n136 \n\n1973). In the laboratory, zooplankton samples were sorted out and cladoceran taxa were \n\nidentified through a binocular stereoscope, using the keys of Scourfield and Harding \n\n(1966) and Amoros (1984a, 1984b), and enumerated.  \n\n \n\n5.2.4. Statistical Analysis \n\nA canonical correspondence analysis or CCA (ter Braak, 1995) was used to ascertain the \n\nrelationships between zooplankton, phytoplankton and environmental variables along \n\nthe study period. CCA extracts synthetic gradients from the biotic and environmental \n\nmatrices and the explanatory variables are quantitatively represented by arrows in \n\ngraphical biplots. The arrow direction indicates positive or negative correlations and their \n\nlength is relative to the importance of the explanatory variable in the ordination. A Monte \n\nCarlo permutation test was used to assess the significance of the relationships between \n\nthe biotic data and the explanatory variables. Variation partitioning was performed \n\naccording to the method developed by Borcard et al. (1992), which permits to single out \n\nthe respective effects of the environmental factors. In our work, we considered two sets \n\nof explanatory variables: biotic (Bio) and abiotic (Abio), being included in Bio the \n\nphytoplankton and cladoceran communities and in Abio the physico-chemical factors. Bio \n\nand Abio variables were obtained by CCA after forward selection of variables. Total \n\nvariations in phytoplankton and cladocerans were portioned as follows: Bio|Abio: fraction \n\nof total variation explained by biotic factors (Bio) alone, not shared with abiotic factors \n\n(Abio); BioxAbio: fraction of total variation explained by the interaction of Bio and Abio; \n\nAbio|Bio: fraction of total variation explained by abiotic factors (Abio) alone, not shared \n\nwith biotic factors (Bio); x: fraction of total variation unexplained by the abiotic and biotic \n\nfactors. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3. Results \n\n5.3.1. Physical and Chemical Characteristics \n\nWater temperature was lower in autumn-winter seasons (10.3\u00baC recorded in November), \n\nand higher in spring-summer seasons (29.4\u00baC recorded in July) (Figure V.1). Oxygen levels \n\nwere relatively stable during the study period, however complete oxygen depletion \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n137 \n\noccurred in May 29, which corresponded to a large fish kill. In general, during the study, \n\npH and conductivity did not show significant variations. Suspended solids presented their \n\nlower values in winter and began to increase in spring, reaching their higher values in \n\nsummer and early autumn. They were mainly constituted by volatile organic materials. \n\nAll analysed nutrients (nitrites, nitrates, SRP and ammonia) showed a similar trend, \n\nwith highest concentrations in the period from December to April, which is explained by \n\nthe adjacent soil leaching, promoted by rain. Nevertheless, ammonia showed an increase \n\nin May 29, corresponding to the fish kill. Alkalinity did not shown considerable changes \n\nduring the sampling period, while hardness showed a substantial decrease after August \n\n(Figure V.1).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V.1.

Seasonal Succession of Phytoplankton and Cladoceran Communities \n\nDuring the sampling period, the algal population of Lake Vela was extremely abundant, \n\nwith a mean density of 4.9 10\n6\n cell. ml\n\n-1\n (ranged from 7.7 10\n\n4\n cell. ml\n\n-1\n in November to \n\n4.9 10\n7\n cell. ml\n\n-1\n in May). However, its diversity was essentially limited to Cyanobacteria, \n\nBacillariophyceae and Chlorophyta, Cyanobacteria being the group with highest densities \n\n(Figure V.2). The dominant species of Cyanobacteria were the colonial algae Choococcus \n\nlimneticus and Microcystis aeruginosa, and the filamentous Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. \n\nThe Chlorophyta community was constituted mainly by coccoid forms of great size (e.g., \n\nCoelastrum reticulatum, Pediastrum simplex, Pediastrum duplex and Scenedesmus sp). All \n\nthe Bacillariophyceae were filamentous, except Stephanodiscus and Cyclotella. There \n\nwere considerable seasonal variations in phytoplankton (Figure V.2). In general, the \n\ndominance of Bacillariophyceae was found in the autumn-winter period (November to \n\nMarch). However, a peak (5.0 10\n6 \n\ncell. ml\n-1\n\n) of Bacillariophyceae was observed in June, \n\nmainly represented by the colonial diatom Achnanthes hungarica (Figure V.2). In early \n\nspring, the phytoplankton was dominated by Chlorophyta (March to April).

CCA and Variation Partitioning Analysis \n\nThe results of the CCA applied to the environmental factors (physical and chemical \n\nvariables and cladoceran community) indicate that only the abiotic factors significantly \n\ninfluence the phytoplankton community (P  0.005; Monte Carlo test of first constrained \n\naxis), explaining 31% of the total variance (Table V.1 and Figures V.5, V.6). The most \n\ndiscriminant physico\u2013chemical variables were temperature, volatile solids, hardness, SRP \n\nand pH (Figure V.5), nevertheless, clear trends are difficult to extract. Provided by the \n\nvariation partitioning analysis, the pure contribution of the physical and chemical \n\nvariables (Abio|Bio) was large (30%) and significant (P 0.005) while the pure contribution \n\nof cladocerans (Bio|Abio) was lower (13%) and not significant (P=0.095). The total \n\nvariation, explained by the abiotic and biotic factors and their interaction, was relatively \n\nhigh with a total of 44% (Figure V.7a). \n\nThe CCA and partial CCA analysis applied to the environmental factors allowed to \n\nascertain that the pure contribution of the physico-chemical parameters (Abio|Bio =1%) \n\nand the phytoplankton (Bio|Abio =4%) did not explain the cladocerans abundance and \n\ndiversity (Figure V.7b). However, the variation shared by (BioxAbio) was 24%, suggesting \n\nan interaction between physico-chemical factors and phytoplankton. Thus, we intend to \n\nperform a CCA of cladocerans with respect to phytoplankton and physico-chemical \n\nvariables, which was explaining 29% of the total variance and showed a statistical \n\nsignificance (P 0.005) (Table V.2). Clear trends are difficult to extract, mainly because of \n\nthe proximity of the species scores (Figure V.8). However, ammonia was the most \n\ndiscriminant variable, which is probably related to the Chl a peak and subsequent oxygen \n\ndepletion on the occasion of the fish kill (May 29). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n142 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure V.5.

Discussion \n\nLake Vela is a eutrophic shallow lake with high nutrient levels (mainly nitrates and \n\nphosphates) and its cladoceran community presents low diversity and high abundances. \n\nCyanobacteria blooms are frequent, especially A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa, and fish \n\nkills have occurred in the last years. Submerged macrophytes are unusually abundant, \n\nplanktivorous fish now dominate, and Chl a presents high values during the warmer \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n146 \n\nmonths. This description is in agreement with the findings of Jeppesen et al. (1999) on \n\neutrophic turbid lakes.  \n\nIn eutrophic lakes the role of nutrients versus zooplankton grazing in controlling \n\nphytoplankton continues to be a controversial question among limnologists. Sommer et \n\nal. (1986) present a general model (the PEG model) for the seasonal planktonic patterns. \n\nAccording to these authors, with nutrient availability and increased light, phytoplankton \n\nproductivity increases in spring and supports growth of cladoceran herbivore populations; \n\nthe herbivore populations increase exponentially and eventually exceed food availability \n\nand decline; in some systems, planktivores fish allied to the food limited accelerates the \n\ndecline of crustacean herbivores and a replacement of larger species by smaller species in \n\nthe summer; autumn destratification, resulting in nutrient replenishment and a \n\ndeterioration of the effective underwater light climate, permits the development of \n\nedible phytoplankton species and a second peak in zooplankton biomass (applied to \n\nstratifying lakes only); a reduction of light energy results in decline of algal biomass to the \n\nwinter minimum, which associated to low winter temperatures restrict herbivores \n\nproduction and some species produce resting stages. \n\nThe CCA performed on the data revealed that the phytoplankton abundances and \n\ndiversity is mainly regulated by abiotic factors, including temperature and nutrients \n\navailability. In respect to the cladocerans, CCA suggests that their distribution was, in \n\npart, influenced by an interaction between physico-chemical factors and phytoplankton. \n\nTherefore, we believe that physico-chemical factors do not influence directly the \n\ncladocerans community, but control the phytoplankton growth, which in turn influence \n\nthe dynamics of cladocerans. The drainage basin of Lake Vela shows at the East side small \n\nrural properties characterised by an intense agricultural activity, as well as intensive \n\nlivestock breeding. Thus, the runoff into the Lake Vela has a high nutrient content, which \n\nexplains the high values recorded for nutrients from winter to early spring. As a \n\nconsequence, we observed an increase of phytoplankton in early spring. According to PEG \n\nmodel, a spring production of small fast-growing algae such as Cryptophyceae and small \n\ncentric Bacillariophyceae develops. In our work, which is corroborated by previous studies \n\nin Lake Vela (Barros, 1994; Fernandes, 1999), was observed that the spring growth of \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n147 \n\nalgae is firstly dominated by Chlorophyta, being replaced by Cyanobacteria. The warm \n\ntemperatures in spring, typical of Mediterranean areas, that enables a faster growth of \n\nCyanobacteria, possibly allied with cladoceran grazing pressure in small edible \n\nphytoplankton, promote their dominance and the appearance of blooms in Lake Vela.  \n\nAs already stated, the presence of Cyanobacteria leads to a decrease  \n\nin Daphnia densities, because Cyanobacteria interfere with filtration, have low \n\ndigestibility and release toxins (e.g., Arnold, 1971; Haney, 1987; Lampert, 1987; \n\nReinikainen et al., 1994; Repka, 1996; 1997; DeMott, 1999; DeMott et al., 2001; Rohrlack \n\net al., 2001; Ghadouani et al., 2003). This evidence can explain the non observed spring \n\npeak of zooplankton in Lake Vela (also non reported in previous limnological works in \n\nLake Vela), which is largely documented in other works (e.g., Sommer et al., 1986; \n\nSaunders et al., 1999) as responsible for the reduction of phytoplankton and the \n\nconsequent clear water phase.  \n\nIn general, smaller cladocerans are less affected by Cyanobacteria (Berzins and Pejler, \n\n1989; Radwan and Popiolek, 1989; Pinel-Alloul, 1993). Frequently there is the \n\nreplacement of large species by small ones, when the Cyanobacteria are dominant \n\n(Lampert, 1982). When comparing the different populations of cladocerans during the \n\nstudy period, it was evident that Daphnia was the most affected species by the spring \n\nCyanobacteria blooms, leading to a drastic reduction of its abundance. On the other \n\nhand, simultaneously to the peak of Cyanobacteria (due to the A. flos-aquae bloom), the \n\nsmall cladoceran C. pulchella reached their highest density ever recorded during the \n\nstudy, showing a positive significantly correlation with Cyanobacteria densities. This fact \n\ncould be also related to the efficient capture and consumption of bacteria by C. pulchella \n\nin the presence of inedible algae (DeMott, 1989). PEG model also reports the \n\nreplacement of larger cladoceran species by smaller ones, but this occurrence is seen \n\nmost distinctly during the summer (Sommer et al., 1986). \n\nThe large amount of unexplicated variation (71%) obtained in our study, suggests \n\nthat cladoceran community structure may not be regulated only by \u201cbottom up\u201d forces \n\nsuch as food availability or nutrients. Predation is often an important factor conditioning \n\nzooplankton structure (e.g., Christoffersen et al., 1993). In summer, zooplankters are \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n148 \n\nsubjected to very high predatory pressure, especially because of YOY fish, and this \n\npressure is size-selective, with major impact in larger-size cladocerans - Daphnia.  \n\nThe massive growth of Cyanobacteria that occurred in May was responsible for the \n\nlarge kill of fish and other aquatic life, as a consequence of complete oxygen depletion. \n\nAlthough the extent of the fish kill was not studied, it seems to have been drastic enough \n\nto diminish the predatory pressure on cladocerans. Under the same conditions, Daphnia \n\nis a better competitor than Ceriodaphnia and it has been experimentally shown that \n\nDaphnia can suppress small species, especially in eutrophic systems, where the \n\ncompetitive effects are more pronounced (Vanni, 1986). Thus, the major fish kills \n\nobserved in May 29 can explain the summer Daphnia peak. However, the decrease of \n\nCyanobacteria after this occurrence, can also explain the increase of D. longispina, and \n\nconsequently the reduction of C. pulchella densities. Previous studies on Lake Vela, in \n\nwhich the fish kills were not recorded, have shown a dominance of D. longispina and B. \n\nlongirostris in the beginning of the summer, but they were replaced by C. pulchella during \n\nthe rest of the season (Vasconcelos, 1990 (only studied the zooplankton community \n\nduring the summer); Barros, 1994). \n\nNutrient limitation is a common characteristic during summer stratification (Sommer \n\net al., 1986). Lake Vela, although it is a non-stratified lake, also presents a limitation of \n\nnutrients in summer, namely a phosphorous limitation (Barros, 1994; Fernandes, 1999). \n\nThis absence is associated to the high growth of phytoplankton that leads to the nutrient \n\ndepletion. As referred by Sommer et al. (1986) the competition for phosphate leads to a \n\nreplacement of green algae by large Bacillariophyceae and later the nitrogen depletion \n\nfavours a shift to nitrogen-fixing of filamentous Cyanobacteria. Lake Vela presents \n\nCyanobacteria dominance in summer (Barros, 1994, Fernandes, 1999), being the A. flos-\n\naquae (a nitrogen-fixing algae) and M. aeruginosa the most representative species in our \n\nstudy.  \n\nA new zooplankton peak typically occurs in autumn, as a consequence of the nutrient \n\nreplenishment and the subsequent development of edible phytoplankton species (e.g. \n\nSommer et al. 1986; Saunders et al., 1999). Lake Vela presents a gradual transition \n\nbetween summer and winter, without the autumn destratification event and the \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n149 \n\nconsequent release of nutrients. However, in our study we observed a Daphnia peak in \n\nthe beginning of autumn, which could be related to the continue decrease of \n\nCyanobacteria and a decrease in predation still associated to the May 29 fish kill. Barros \n\n(1994) presents in her work an autumnal peak of cladocerans, although with C. pulchella \n\ndominance, which is possibly related to the fish predation pressure on major cladocerans \n\nthat persists in early autumn.  \n\nIn winter, the reduction of light energy results in phytoplankton biomass decrease to \n\nthe minimum, which is associated to cool winter temperatures and restricts zooplankton \n\nproduction rates and, for some species, stimulates diapause (Sommer et al., 1986). Our \n\nstudy, as well as the work developed by Barros (1994) in Lake Vela, showed low \n\nabundances of cladocerans during the winter. The decline of edible algae biomass in \n\nwinter, that only starts to increase after the typical winter precipitation and the \n\nconsequent runoff and nutrient replenishment, can explain this event. In addition, the \n\nrole of temperature, which influences the metabolic rates of cladocerans (e.g., Burns, \n\n1969; Goss and Bunting, 1983; Moore et al., 1996; Giebelhausen and Lampert, 2001), is \n\nalso an important factor that can explain their lower winter densities. It is possible to \n\nobserve the presence of resting eggs produced by D. longispina in Lake Vela. However, \n\nthis occurrence was not only associated with the low temperatures, being observed the \n\npresence of resting eggs along the year as a consequence of several stressing factors.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5. Conclusion  \n\nFrom the present study we conclude that the seasonal pattern of the phytoplankton and \n\ncladoceran communities is more or less coherent with the general model of plankton \n\nseasonal succession described for other temperate lakes. \n\nPhytoplankton in Lake Vela is mainly regulated by physico-chemical factors, namely \n\nnutrients. However, the high Mediterranean temperatures had an important role in the \n\nplankton succession, being responsible for the exponential Cyanobacteria development in \n\nspring and summer. Moreover, the present work demonstrated that phytoplankton is one \n\nof the main factors responsible for the succession of cladoceran community, which are \n\n\n\nChapter V \n\n150 \n\nwell related to changes in algae composition and density, the Cyanobacteria being the \n\ngroup with major impact. Nevertheless, the consequences of fish kills, such as the one \n\nrecorded here, enhanced the structuring role that fish have on the cladoceran seasonal \n\ndynamics, and that any irregular event in the system has effects on the normal seasonal \n\nsuccession of plankton. It is important to consider that this occurrence has been regularly \n\nobserved in Lake Vela and its effects on the zooplanktonic community are not yet fully \n\nunderstood.  \n\nIt should be considered that the changes shown by organisms, in general, do not \n\noccur as a response to a single factor, but to a complexity of interactions generated by a \n\nlarge range of factors. Thus, further information on competitive interactions within \n\nplankton, toxic cyanobacteria, anti-predator defences, or YOY fish, should be included in \n\nsuch models in order to understand the intricate trophic relationships of aquatic systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.6.

Gon\u00e7alves \nCESAM e Departamento de Biologia da Universidade de Aveiro, Campus Universit\u00e1rio de Santiago, 3810-\n193 Aveiro, Portugal. \n \n\nSubmited to: Water Air &amp; Soil Pollution, 2007 \n \n\nAbstract \n\nTerrestrial Model Ecosystems (TMEs) are frequently used to assess the potentially \n\nharmful effects of contaminants on terrestrial organisms. Nonetheless we used this \n\napparatus to simulate the leaching phenomena in agricultural soils, from the drainage \n\nbasin of Lake Vela (Figueira da Foz, Central Portugal), and to perform a subsequent \n\nevaluation of the toxicity of the leachates obtained, after a treatment of the soil cores \n\nwith the herbicide Lasso\u00ae on non-target freshwater species. In this way, standard (algae: \n\nPseudokirchneriella subcapitata; cladoceran: Daphnia magna) and local (algae: \n\nAphanizomenon flos-aquae; cladoceran: Daphnia longispina) species were exposed to \n\nseveral dilutions of leachates derived from different treatments applied to soil-cores \n\ncollected in an agricultural field from Lake Vela surrounds: RW- soil-core irrigated only \n\nwith artificial rain water; RW+L- soil-core irrigated with artificial rain water after the \n\napplication of Lasso\u00ae; GW+L \u2013soil-core irrigated with groundwater collected in local wells \n\nafter the application of Lasso\u00ae. Chemical analysis confirmed the presence of alachlor \n\n(active ingredient of Lasso\u00ae) in the leachates RW+L and GW+L at concentrations of 88.0 \n\ngL\n-1\n\n and 16.9 gL\n-1\n\n, respectively. As expected, the results demonstrated that the \n\nleachate RW did not present toxicity for the several tested species. On the contrary, \n\nleachates where the herbicide was applied, particularly the RW+L, showed a higher \n\ntoxicity to P. subcapitata (96h-IC50 =9.7%), which contrasts with the absence of toxic \n\neffects in A. flos-aquae. Notwithstanding the effects on the green algae, the reproduction \n\nand growth of both daphnids were not affected by the potential toxicity of leachates. \n\nNevertheless, our results were consistent with the chemical analysis and alachlor \n\necotoxicity data reported in literature. Our study confirms that the current use of \n\npesticides in the lands near Lake Vela, especially Lasso\u00ae, allied to soils specific \n\ncharacteristics, can easily contaminate the aquatic ecosystem through leaching and could \n\ncompromise their weak balance by affecting one of the main trophic levels: the primary \n\nproducers. \n\n \n\nKeywords: lakes; alachlor; terrestrial model ecosystem; leachates; daphnids; algae \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n162 \n\n6.1. Introduction \n\nAccording to tiered-approach frameworks for the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of \n\ncontaminated sites, if concerns about the potential risk of chemicals in the environment \n\nsubsist in the first tiers the assessment should proceed to in situ or laboratory conditions \n\nwith great environmental realism in order to reduce uncertainties (Boxall et al., 2002). \n\nTerrestrial model ecosystems (TMEs) may be a useful tool for site-specific evaluations \n\nwithin the risk assessment context (Weyers et al., 2004). More specifically, TMEs can be \n\nused as a diagnostic instrument for contaminated sites or a prognostic instrument for the \n\nERA of individual chemicals, mixtures of chemicals and bio-products (Knacker et al., \n\n2004). Integrated in the European Union (EU) project \u201cThe use of TME to assess \n\nenvironmental risks in ecosystems\u201d a TME ring-test and field-validation study was \n\nrecently performed (e.g., Forster et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2004; Knacher et al., 2004; \n\nKoolhaas et al., 2004; Moser et al., 2004a, 2004b; Rombke et al., 2004; Sousa et al., 2004; \n\nVan Gestel et al., 2004). Although TMEs have been used, almost exclusively, to evaluate \n\nthe fate and effects of chemical substances in the soil compartment (e.g., Knacher et al., \n\n2004; Weyers et al., 2004; Boleas et al., 2005; Van den Brink et al., 2005), they can also be \n\nused to evaluate the potential toxicity of contaminants on non-target species from the \n\naquatic compartment, the common final receptor system of the great majority of soil \n\ncontaminants, since they allow the collection of soil leachates yielded by soil irrigation \n\n(Knachers et al., 2004). \n\nLake Vela, a freshwater shallow lake, located in the Centre of Portugal (Figueira da \n\nFoz), is exposed to diffuse pollution generated by agricultural and livestock activities. 48% \n\nof the drainage basin of this lake is occupied by agricultural fields that contribute for a \n\nhigh input of nutrients and pesticides in the system (Fernandes, 1999). In fact, initial \n\nresults from the ecological risk assessment that is being conducted in Lake Vela (Abrantes \n\net al., 2006a) confirms the contamination of water and sediment with current and non-\n\ncurrent used pesticides and indicates that alachlor, aldrin and dieldrin are substances of \n\nconcern for aquatic species.  \n\nIn this context, the main purpose of this study, integrated in the ecological risk \n\nassessment planed for Lake Vela, (Abrantes et al., 2006), was to assess the potential \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n163 \n\nleaching of Lasso\u00ae in agricultural lands around the lake and their ecotoxicological impact \n\non non-target freshwater species. To attain this purpose agricultural soil cores were \n\ncollected and used to simulate the soil leaching in laboratory conditions and following \n\nagricultural practices for pesticides application and crop irrigation. Thereafter the lethal \n\nand sublethal toxicity of leachates was assessed through standard toxicity assays with the \n\ngreen algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon phlos-\n\naquae and the daphnids Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.1.

Pesticide Properties \n\nAlachlor (active ingredient of the herbicide Lasso\u00ae) is a chloroacetamide pre-emergent \n\nherbicide widely used to control weed grasses, being the second most traded pesticide in \n\nPortugal (Vieira, 2006). Its potential for contamination of surface and groundwater is high \n\nowing to its physicochemical properties, particularly solubility in water (170.31 mgL\n-1\n\n at \n\npH=7 and 20\u00baC) (Tomlin, 2000) and mobility in soil (log Koc ranging from 2.08 to 2.28) \n\n500 m   \n\nArboreal vegetation \nShrubby vegetation \nAgricultural fields \nHuman settlements \n\nLake Vela    \n\nStables   \n\n \n\n  N   \n\nLisbon   \n\nOporto     \n\nFigueira  \nda Foz   \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\nP\nO\n\nR\nT\n\nU\nG\n\nA\nL \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n164 \n\n(USEPA, 2002a), which enables it to leach from soil to aquatic systems (El-Nahhal et al., \n\n1998), its half-life in aquifers (ranging from 808 to1518 days) (USEPA, 2002a) and its \n\nhydrolysis half-life in surface water (28 days) (Tomlin, 2000). Alachlor makes part of the \n\nlist of priority substances defined by the European Commision (EC, 2001), whose \n\nsubstantial risk for the aquatic system demands a progressive reduction or banishment. \n\n \n\n6.2.2. Experimental Set-up \n\nSoil-cores were taken from agricultural lands located in the east margin of Lake Vela \n\n(Figueira da Foz, Central Portugal) in spring, before the seasonal application of pesticides \n\nused for pre-emergent control of corn crops (Figure VI.1). To minimise the differences in \n\nsoil properties soil-cores were collected close to each other. The procedures of extraction, \n\ntransport and handling of soil-cores followed the methodologies described by Knacker et \n\nal. (2004). In the laboratory, soil-cores were placed in moveable carts in a climatic \n\nchamber, under constant laboratory conditions (air temperature: 20\u00b12\u00baC; relative \n\nhumidity: 50-80%; light intensity: 8000 lux; photoperiod 16h\nL\n:8h\n\nD\n). Each soil core was \n\nconnected to a glass bottle allowing the collection of leachates obtained by soil irrigation. \n\nThe soil cores were left undisturbed during one month to permit soil structure \n\nstabilization. After this period Lasso\u00ae was applied and for this purpose three different \n\ntreatments were defined, with 6 replicates per treatment: RW- soil-cores only irrigated \n\nwith artificial rain water [formulated according to Davies et al. (2004)]; RW+L - soil-cores \n\ntreated with Lasso\u00ae and irrigated with artificial rain water;, and GW+L - soil-cores treated \n\nwith Lasso\u00ae and irrigated with groundwater collected from local wells, usually used as \n\nirrigation water in agricultural lands near Lake Vela. Both pesticide application and \n\nirrigation was based on local agricultural practices. Lasso\u00ae was diluted in water in a ratio \n\nof 1:100 (v/v), in a final concentration of alachlor of 4.8 gL\n-1\n\n. The solution was applied to \n\nthe soil-cores using a sprayer at an application rate of 0.185 Lm\n-2\n\n. After the pesticide \n\napplication, and to promote leaching, soils were uniformly irrigated. The irrigation took \n\nplace every 5 days in a daily rate of 32.27 Lm\n-2\n\n, corresponding to 31.4 Lm\n-2\n\n of irrigation \n\nwater used by local farmers and to 1.34 Lm\n-2\n\n relative to the average precipitation \n\nrecorded in May (soil sampling period) in the Lake Vela area (INAG, 2007). Due to the high \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n165 \n\npermeability of soils, the leachates were quickly obtained after the irrigation and the \n\nseveral replicates of each treatment were mixed, to get a composite sample, and \n\nimmediately stored in the dark at 4\u00baC, until the bioassays were performed, in a period \n\nnever exceeding one week. At the onset of the bioassays, the pH of leachates was \n\nadjusted to values ranging between 7.3 and 7.7.  \n\n \n\n6.2.3. Physico-chemical Analysis \n\nThe soil was characterized for basic pedological descriptors including particle size \n\ndistribution, organic matter content, pH and water-holding capacity. An analysis to detect \n\nbackground concentrations of alachlor in soil and groundwater was performed by gas \n\nchromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) (USEPA, 1995).  \n\nAlachlor concentrations were also assessed in the composed samples of soil \n\nleachates obtained from each TME treatment. Soluble reactive phosphorus (ascorbic acid \n\nmethod; PO4\n3-\n\n), un-ionized ammonia (Nessler method; NH3-N), nitrate (cadmium \n\nreduction method; NO3-N) and nitrite (calorimetric method; NO2-N) concentrations were \n\nalso measured in soil leachates, in artificial rainwater and in groundwater, according to \n\nmethodologies described by Lind (1979) and APHA (1995). \n\n \n\n6.2.4. Culture of Organisms \n\nUnialgal inoculum cultures of A. flos-aquae (isolated from a sample collected in Lake Vela \n\na few years ago) and the standard species P. subcapitata (formely named Selenastrum \n\ncapricornutum) were maintained in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, with 100 ml of sterilized \n\nMBL, shaking at 100 r.p.m in an orbital shaker and under controlled temperature \n\n(20\u00b12\u00baC) and photoperiod (16h\nL\n:8h\n\nD\n). To start new cultures, algae were harvested during \n\nits exponential growth phase (5\u20137 days old) and inoculated in a fresh medium. \n\nMonoclonal cultures of D. magna (clone A, sensu Baird et al., 1989a) and D. \n\nlongispina (isolated from a sample collected in Lake Vela a few years ago) were \n\ncontinuously reared in the laboratoty, under a photoperiod of 16h\nL\n:8h\n\nD\n and a \n\ntemperature of 20\u00b12 \u00b0C, in the synthetic ASTM hardwater medium (ASTM, 1996) supplied \n\nwith an organic additive to provide essential microelements to daphnids (Baird et al., \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n166 \n\n1989b). Cultures were renewed every two days and the organisms were fed with P. \n\nsubcapitata at a rate of 3.0x10\n5\n cells/ml/day and 1.5x10\n\n5\n cells.ml\n\n-1./\nday for D. magna and \n\nD. longispina, respectively. \n\n \n\n6.2.5. Assays with Algae \n\nAlgae growth inhibition assays were conducted according to USEPA (2002b) and OECD \n\n(2002) guidelines. The two test species (P. subcapitata and A. flos-aquae) were exposed \n\nfor 96h period to a range of dilutions of the soil leachates (12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0 and \n\n100.0%) obtained with the MBL medium. Assays were performed in 100 ml glass vials \n\nfilled with 40 ml of each leachate dilution or MBL control, in a total of three replicates per \n\ndilution and control. Test vials were incubated in the same conditions described above for \n\nalgae cultures maintenance, with an initial cell density of approximately 10\n4\n cells.ml\n\n-1\n \n\n(inoculated from the exponential-growing batch culture). To exclude any potential effects \n\nfrom nutrient deficiency promoted by dilutions, additional controls were tested using \n\ndistilled water as the dilution medium. At the end of each assay, the cells density was \n\ndetermined as a biomass parameter. The growth rate (GR.day\n-1\n\n) and percentage of \n\ngrowth inhibition (% I) were calculated from cells density measurements.  \n\n \n\n6.2.6. Assays with Cladocerans \n\nSub-lethal assays with cladocerans (D.magna and D. longispina) followed OECD (1998) \n\nand USEPA (2002b) guidelines. A range of dilutions of soil leachates (12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0 \n\nand 100.0%) was obtained using ASTM culture medium. Only neonates born between the \n\nthird and the fifth broods ( 24-hr old) were used in tests (Barata and Baird, 1998). For \n\neach leachate dilution and ASTM negative control, 10 replicates were used. The \n\norganisms were exposed individually, in 100 ml glass beakers; test medium was changed \n\nevery two days. Organisms were fed daily with P. subcapitata at a rate of 3.0x10\n5\n \n\ncells/ml/day and 1.5x10\n5\n cells/ml/day for D. magna and D. longispina, respectively, \n\nsupplied with an organic additive (see feed rates in the Culture of organisms section). \n\nDissolved oxygen and pH were monitored throughout the test for validation purposes. \n\nTest vessels were checked daily and neonates, when present, were counted and \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n167 \n\nremoved. Survival, growth, fecundity (number of neonates), the age at the first \n\nreproduction and the number of broods were the endpoints assessed in these assays The \n\ntest finished after 60% or more of the control females have released their third brood \n\n(USEPA 2002b). The body length of females was estimated at the beginning and at the \n\nend of the test, by extrapolation from moult exopodite length (Pereira et al., 2004), \n\npermitting calculation of the somatic growth rate of the females (SGR.day\n-1\n\n). Fecundity, \n\nsurvival and age at each brood release were integrated in the calculation of the rate of \n\npopulation increase (r, day\n-1\n\n) using the Euler-Lotka equation (Meyer et al., 1986). \n\nAccording to Forbes and Calow (1999) r is a better measure of responses to toxicants than \n\nare individual-level effects because it integrates potentially complex interactions of life-\n\nhistory traits, providing a more relevant measure of ecological impact. The Jack-knife \n\ntechnique was used to calculate standard errors for r (Meyer et al., 1986).  \n\n \n\n6.2.7. Statistical Analysis \n\nOne-way-ANOVA, followed by a Dunnett test, was used to assess significant differences \n\n(p<0.05) in the endpoints assessed among each soil leachate dilution and the control (Zar, \n\n1996). Probit regression analysis (Finney, 1971) was used to calculate the IC50 (96h) and \n\nIC10 (96h) for algae growth inhibition and the EC50 and EC10 for daphnids SGR and r. The \n\ndifferent test parameters are reported as percentages of soil leachates dilutions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3. Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n6.3.1. Physico-chemical Analysis \n\nThe composite soil sample collected in the east margin of the Lake Vela was acidic \n\n(pH=5.85) and characterized by a low organic matter content (2.11% \u00b1 0.7). Regarding \n\ngrain size distribution the soil was classified, according to the British scheme, as a sandy \n\nloam soil (fractions:&lt;60 m=42%; 60-120 m=58%). Both properties contributed for the \n\nlow water-holding capacity (WHC: 3.10% \u00b1 1.2) of this soil and subsequently to their high \n\npermeability. Hence, the main general physical and chemical characteristics of this soil \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n168 \n\nseemed to favour the mobility of pesticides potentially applied in the margins of Lake \n\nVela, which are contributing for the risks of contamination of this freshwater aquatic \n\nsystem. In fact, according to Barbash and Resek (1997) the texture and structure of the \n\nsoil, as well as the organic matter content, are the main factors determining the \n\nadsorption of pesticides to soil particles preventing their transport. Additionally, the \n\nchemical properties of the pesticide alachlor, particularly its relatively high mobility in soil \n\n(log Koc ranging from 2.08 to 2.28) (USEPA, 2002a), increases the potential for leaching \n\nand consequently to contaminate the aquatic systems (Kolpin, 1997). The chemical \n\nanalysis of the leachates revealed the presence of alachlor in both treatments to which \n\nthe pesticide was applied (RW+L: 88.0 gL\n-1\n\n and GW+L: 16.9 gL\n-1\n\n) (Table VI.1). Moreover, \n\nalachlor was not recorded on soil and on groundwater used for irrigation in the GW+L, \n\neliminating other potential sources of contamination of the leachates. Table VI.1 shows \n\nthe physical and chemical properties of the leachates. The RW+L was more acidic, while \n\nthe GW+L leachate showed the highest concentration of nutrients (particularly nitrates). \n\nThese differences were certainly associated with the water used for irrigation. In fact, \n\nrainwater was more acidic than groundwater (RW: pH=5.8 ; GW: pH=7.1) while the \n\ngroundwater showed high levels of nutrients, probably as a consequence of in situ \n\nleaching of fertilizers also applied to agricultural fields. Regarding the alachlor \n\nconcentrations measured in both leachates RW+L and GW+L (Table VI.1), there was a \n\nclearl difference between them. Due to the low pH of rainwater, the hydronium ions \n\n(H\n3\nO\n\n+\n) in solution may have neutralized the negative charges of soil organic compounds \n\nand mineral particles, diminishing the sites available for alachlor sorption and therefore \n\nincreasing its mobility.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter VI \n\n169 \n\nTable VI.1.

Assays with Algae \n\nFigure VI.2 and Table VI.2 illustrates the results of the assays with P. subcapitata and A. \n\nflos-aquae. Any toxic effects were recorded on both species for the RW leachate. By \n\ncontrast, the leachates from the treatments with the pesticide Lasso\u00ae (RW+L and GW+L) \n\nwere highly toxic to the green algae P. subcapitata, causing a significantly reduction in \n\ntheir growth rate (GR) even at the highest leachate dilution (12.5%). For this algae species \n\nIC50 (96h) values of 9.7% (RW+L) and of 24.3% (GW+L) were recorded. The toxic effect of \n\nleachates was not promoted by the depletion of nutrients because controls with different \n\nconcentrations of MBL performed similarly. Moreover, considering the results of the \n\nchemical analysis (see above in the Physico-chemical analysis section) and the sequence \n\nof dilutions performed in the leachates, the toxicity recorded to P. subcapitata \n\ncorresponded approximately to a concentration of alachlor within the range of the IC50 \n\nvalues reported in literature [e.g., Fairchild et al. (1998): IC50 (96h)=10 gL\n-1\n\n; Tomlin \n\n(2000): IC50 (72h)=12 gL\n-1\n\n; Monsanto Company (2002): IC50 (96h)=2.9 gL\n-1\n\n]. According to \n\nrecent findings, chloroacetamides act primarily inhibiting the formation of very-long-\n\nchain fatty acids (VLCFAs) through the inhibition of the VLCFA synthase (FAE1) (B\u00f6ger, \n\n2003). As it is a crucial metabolic process, the inhibition of VLCFAs is phytotoxic to algae \n\nand higher plants, affecting the plasma membrane stability and functions required for cell \n\nelongation and division (B\u00f6ger, 2003), which results in the inhibition of cell division and \n\ngrowth and finally in the death of the plant.

The presence of algal blooms in \n\nLake Vela is frequently associated with an increase in water temperature and with the \n\ninput of nutrients from anthropogenic sources, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus \n\n(Abrantes et al., 2006b; de Figueiredo et al., 2006). Nevertheless, the low sensitivity \n\nshowed by A. flos-aquae to pesticides relative to the green algae can also explain their \n\nmassive growth and dominance in summer, after the application of pesticides. Generally, \n\nthe dynamic of phytoplankton communities and the shift in dominant populations has \n\nbeing mainly attributed to physical, nutritional and biological factors. Our results \n\nunderline the importance of incorporating data regarding pesticides concentrations in \n\naquatic systems within the current models used to explain the fluctuation of freshwater \n\npopulations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure VI.2.

Assays with Cladocerans \n\nFigure VI.3 and Table VI.2 illustrate the results for the endpoints assessed in the assays \n\nwith D. magna and D. longispina. In spite of the contamination of leachates (RW+L and \n\nGW+L) with alachlor, no significant toxic effects were recorded on the somatic growth \n\nrate (SGR) and on the rate of population increase (r) for both species. Although the lack of \n\nliterature data regarding alachlor chronic toxicity to Daphnia sp., acute toxicity values \n\nreported are usually remarkably higher (by three orders of magnitude) than the \n\nconcentrations recorded in the leachates [e.g., Tomlin (2000): 48h-EC50 = 10,000 gL\n-1\n\n; \n\nMonsanto Company (2002): 48h-EC50 = 22,000 gL\n-1\n\n].  \n\nWhen exposed to certain stimulus, Daphnia sp. adjusts its fitness in terms of the \n\nenergy allocation to guarantee the maintenance and survival of the population \n\n(Polishchuk and Vijverberg, 2005; Pieters and Liess, 2006). In the presence of stress \n\nagents, Daphnia produces small broods with few large eggs, and the resulting neonates \n\nhave more energy reserves that increase their resistance to starvation (Gliwicz and \n\nGuisande, 1992; Enserink et al., 1995; Knops et al., 2001; Coors et al., 2004;) or to toxic \n\nstress (Enserink et al., 1990; Smolders et al., 2005; Pieters and Liess, 2006).

Conclusion \n\nThis study showed that TMEs are a suitable and helpful tool for the simulation of the \n\npesticides leaching phenomena in soils with a reduced retention function, and for the \n\nassessment of subsequent toxic effects in non-target aquatic organisms, under laboratory \n\nconditions.  \n\nIt was confirmed that Lake Vela has serious risks of contamination through leaching \n\nof pesticides, applied in surrounding agricultural fields, especially of the herbicide Lasso\u00ae, \n\ndue to their great mobility in the soil compartment. Moreover, the results of bioassays \n\nwith non-target species confirm that the contamination of the aquatic system could \n\nindirectly compromise the whole ecosystem by affecting the primary producers. Although \n\nthis pesticide seemed not affect the primary consumers, those can be indirectly affected \n\nby changes in the structure of the phytoplankton community resulting, ultimately, in deep \n\nalterations in all the planktonic community of the lake. Thus, the obtained results are \n\nimportant from both regulatory and research perspectives with the final purpose of \n\nprotecting and guarantee the sustainability of freshwater ecosystems.  \n\n \n\n \n\n6.5.

These \n\nanthropogenic activities, through runoff or leaching, contribute to a great input of \n\nnutrients and pesticides accelerating the eutrophication process, and affecting non-target \n\naquatic species, which compromises the environmental quality of the entire ecosystem as \n\nwell as their value for recreational purposes. Hence, it was considered urgent and \n\nimperative to assess the risks posed by diffuse pollution to Lake Vela in order to provide \n\nuseful information for the establishment of restoration and management measures \n\ndirected to promote its sustainability. In Portugal, environmental recovery actions are \n\nusually based on impact assessment studies, which consist in a compilation of biological \n\nsurvey data characterized by scarce or absence of toxicological information. In order to \n\nsurpass this setback, an ERA framework was used to assess the risks posed by diffuse \n\npollution to the aquatic life. Some inferences were also made regarding potential risks to \n\nhuman health. ERA is a flexible and integrative process of orderliness and analysis of \n\ninformation related to the entire ecosystem, whose main goal is the evaluation of the \n\nlikelihood that adverse ecological effects are caused by exposure to stressors (USEPA, \n\n1998). Through the identification of potential risks it is possible to recognize \n\nenvironmental problems, to select priorities for environment protection, to select targets \n\nto control, to assess the effectiveness of management options, and identify research \n\nneeds. Moreover, ERA provides a critical component enabling risk managers to make \n\nwell-founded environmental decisions. Some of the tasks proposed in the first step of this \n\nrisk assessment process (chapter II), were performed in this study. However, more work is \n\nneeded and is being done to present a reliable assessment of risks to the entire \n\necosystem. Nevertheless, through a weight-of-evidence approach some conclusions can \n\nbe made combining the several assessed lines of evidence (chemical concentrations: in \n\nwater, sediment and groundwater; fishes body burden; biological surveys; toxicity tests).  \n\n The present study confirmed the contamination of Lake Vela by diffuse pollution \n\nfrom local anthropogenic activities (e.g., agriculture and livestock), illustrated by the \n\n\n\nChapter VII \n\n \n\n184 \n\npresence of pesticides and by the high amounts of nutrients. Residues of current and non-\n\ncurrent pesticides, including two organochloride pesticides (OCPs) banned decades ago \n\n(aldrin and dieldrin), were detected in lake surface water, groundwater and sediments \n\n(chapter III). The measured concentrations of pesticides compared with toxicological \n\nbenchmarks indicated the likelihood of harmful effects for aquatic species, due to the \n\npresence of alachlor, aldrin and dieldrin. The risk threshold of 1, calculated by HQ for \n\nthese pesticides, was largely exceeded, indicating the existence of potential risks for the \n\naquatic biota of Lake Vela. As reported in the chapter IV and V, high nutrient contents \n\nwere also recorded in Lake Vela water. In fact, the use of TMEs to simulate the leaching of \n\npesticides in local agricultural soils (chapter VI), confirmed that the current use of \n\npesticides in agricultural fields near Lake Vela, especially Lasso\u00ae, allied to the site-specific \n\ncharacteristics (e.g., the high permeability and low organic matter content of soils), can \n\neasily contribute for the contamination of the aquatic ecosystem. \n\n The seasonal variation of nutrients and pesticides observed in water and sediment \n\nsamples was associated to the seasonality of the agricultural activity and to climatic \n\nfactors, namely rainfall events, which promote the leaching and runoff of contaminants \n\n(chapter IV). The main crop in the surrounding agricultural fields is corn for livestock \n\nwhose cultivation starts with land tillage in late April and continues until September, \n\nwhen corn is harvested. According to local farmers, the lands are highly fertilized with \n\ncommercial products and livestock manures, and pesticides are intensively used, \n\nparticularly the herbicides Lasso\u00ae and Roundup\u00ae for pre-emergent control. All the \n\nanalyzed nutrients in water samples showed their highest values in the winter sampling \n\nperiod, especially nitrate and orthophosphate, providing evidence for the role of rainfall \n\nin the input of nutrients. The presence of pesticides, both in water and sediments was \n\nonly reported in summer and autumn, with the highest concentrations recorded in \n\nautumn. In summer, the irrigation of lands is the main factor that promotes the runoff \n\nand leaching of pesticides, while in autumn the inputs of pesticides are certainly related \n\nto the elevated precipitation recorded before the sample.  \n\n All the pesticides analyzed were detected in water samples from both lake \n\nmargins (EM and WM), suggesting the dispersion of contaminants throughout the whole \n\n\n\nChapter VII \n\n \n\n185 \n\nwater body (chapter III). Nonetheless, the pesticide concentrations in the samples from \n\nthe margin adjacent to agricultural lands (EM) were slightly more elevated. Regarding \n\nsediment samples there was a clear spatial variation of pesticides, which were below the \n\ndetection limit in WM samples. This variation was consistent with the characteristics of \n\nsediments. In general, sediments collected in EM, when compared with those from the \n\nWM, presented a greater percentage of small size particles (silt and clay) and organic \n\nmatter, which promote the higher adsorption of pesticides. In fact, the proximity of \n\nagricultural lands to the east and southeast margins of the lake is responsible for the \n\ninput of small size particles of soil and of organic matter through surface runoff. \n\nThe nutrient enrichment, or eutrophication, can lead to highly undesirable changes in \n\naquatic ecosystem structure and function (Smith et al., 1999), being responsible for the \n\nloss of aquatic biodiversity (Carpenter et al., 1998). Examples of adverse effects caused by \n\neutrophication include: increased biomass of phytoplankton; shifts in the phytoplanktonic \n\ncommunity to bloom-forming species that may be toxic or inedible; changes in \n\nmacrophyte species abundance and diversity; decreases in water transparency; \n\ndominance of small zooplanktonic species; oxygen depletion; increased incidence of fish \n\nkills; replacement of autochthonous species, more susceptible, by exotic species \n\n(modified from Carpenter et al. (1998)). In fact, toxic algal blooms have become \n\nincreasingly frequent (e.g., A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa) and large fish kills have \n\noccurred in recent years in Lake Vela, as reported in chapter V. Moreover, the fish \n\ncommunity was radically altered, due to the introduction of exotic species, mainly \n\npumpkinseed sunfish (Castro, 2007), and the zooplankton was characterized by the \n\ndominance of rotifers in detriment of the cladocerans and copepods. All of these \n\ncharacteristics confirmed the advanced trophic state of Lake Vela and are indicators of its \n\nalarming condition. Actually, Antunes et al. (2003), through comparison with previous \n\nlimnological works, reports that Lake Vela is more eutrophic than 10 years ago.  \n\nAmong the anthropogenic chemicals, pesticides may cause the most serious \n\nenvironmental problems because of their toxic effects and their bioaccumulation (Larson \n\net al., 1999). Pesticides often affect nontarget organisms at several levels of the aquatic \n\ntrophic chains and consequently affect the structure and the functioning of the whole \n\n\n\nChapter VII \n\n \n\n186 \n\naquatic ecosystem (Hanazato, 2001). The use of a whole sample toxicity assessment \n\n(chapter IV) to evaluate the contamination and toxicity of water and sediment elutriates \n\nshowed that water samples collected in summer and autumn affected significantly the \n\ngrowth rate of the green algae P. subcapitata at higher concentrations, which could be \n\ndue to the presence of pesticides, namely the herbicide alachlor. Likewise, they revealed \n\nan apparent toxicity associated to the elutriate EM for P. subcapitata and for both \n\ndaphnids, affecting their growth and reproduction. Although no pesticides were found in \n\nelutriates, high levels of un-ionized ammonia were recorded. In fact, ammonia has been \n\nconsidered a confounding factor in sediment toxicology (Lapota et al., 2000; Postma et \n\nal., 2002; Losso et al., 2007), with un-ionized ammonia being the most toxic form to \n\naquatic environments (Camargo and Alonso, 2006). By comparing the several species, P. \n\nsubcapitata revealed to be the most sensitive taxon, followed by the daphnids, and then \n\nby A. flos-aquae. The presence of algal blooms in Lake Vela is frequently associated with \n\nan increase in water temperature, in the warm season, as well as with nutrients-\n\nenrichment, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus (chapter V). Nevertheless, the low \n\nsensitivity showed by A. flos-aquae to pesticides and ammonia relative to the green algae \n\ncan also explain their massive growth and dominance in summer, after the application of \n\npesticides. In general, the dynamics of phytoplankton and the shift in populations are only \n\nattributed to physical, nutritional and biological factors. This way, our results underline \n\nthe importance of incorporating the contamination data within models to explain the \n\npopulation fluctuations. Although the presence of contaminants in Lake Vela seemed not \n\nto affect the fitness of daphnids in the laboratory, it is important to consider the potential \n\ntoxic effects in other related trophic levels, especially in primary producers. In this way, \n\neffects in edible algae, as reported for P. subcapitata, could indirectly affect their \n\nconsumers, namely daphnids. Additionally, the toxicity tests performed with the \n\nleachates obtained through the use of TMEs (chapter VI) confirmed that the current use \n\nof pesticides in the lands near Lake Vela, especially Lasso\u00ae (formulated with alachlor), \n\nallied to the site- specific characteristics, can affect the green algae, as it was recorded for \n\nP. subcapitata. \n\n\n\nChapter VII \n\n \n\n187 \n\n Another line of evidence was the accumulation of alachlor in predator and benthic \n\nfish species, which confirms the bioavailability of this compound and their potential for \n\nbioaccumulation (chapter III). The ingestion of contaminated fish from Lake Vela could \n\nrepresent a risk to ecological and human receptors. Considering that top predators, such \n\nas otters and birds, are regular fish eating predators and that the transfers of \n\ncontaminants through the food chain results in an increase of the xenobiotics \n\nconcentrations in organisms from higher trophic levels (EC, 2003), the accumulation of \n\nalachlor in fish tissues may result in toxic concentrations to top predators. Regarding the \n\nhuman receptors, it was not possible to ascertain if the consumption of fish from Lake \n\nVela represents a risk to human health because the amount of fish consumed per \n\nindividual as well as the frequency of intake were unknown.  \n\n The concentrations of pesticides recorded in groundwater samples were also \n\nabove the recommended safety levels for drinking water, which constitutes a concern for \n\nthe local population\u2019s health. This evidence indicated that the use of groundwater as a \n\nsource of drinking water is likely to cause effects on the human health. EPA has found \n\nthat long-term exposure to alachlor potentially causes damages in the liver, kidney, \n\nspleen, nasal mucosa and eyes at levels above the MCL. Additionally, there exists \n\nevidence that alachlor is carcinogenic to humans for lifetime exposures at levels above \n\nthe MCL (USEPA, 2007b). Aldrin and dieldrin are highly toxic to humans, affecting the \n\ncentral nervous system and the liver. USEPA has classified aldrin and dieldrin as probable \n\nhuman carcinogens in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database (USEPA, \n\n2004). Glyphosate can cause kidney damage and reproductive effects for long term \n\nexposures above the MCL (USEPA, 2007c). Glyphosate was not classified as carcinogenic \n\nto humans (USEPA, 2004).  \n\n In summary, following a the weight of evidence approach, in a qualitative \n\nevaluation of risks, strong evidences were provided regarding the risks posed by diffuse \n\npollution to the Lake Vela ecosystem. Moreover, regarding the several assessed lines of \n\nevidence it is feasible to establish, with some reasonability, causality between the \n\nstressor and the effects. However, it is not possible to establish specificity between the \n\n\n\nChapter VII \n\n \n\n188 \n\nstressor and the effects by the fact that several causal factors can be responsible for the \n\nobserved effects.  \n\nThis study provides relevant information that could be helpful in future \n\nenvironmental decisions. Moreover, the environmental problems in Lake Vela were not \n\nan isolated case; actually, several freshwater shallow lakes in Portugal have similar \n\nproblems. In this way the methodologies defined and used in this study may be also \n\napplied in other places. Nevertheless, despite our efforts to develop new tools for \n\nenvironmental assessment, they alone will not solve environmental problems (Moraes, \n\n2002). In fact, problems will remain while conservation goals still poorly defined and \n\nenvironmental regulations are not implemented or are disregarded.  \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAntunes S.C., Abrantes N., Gon\u00e7alves F., 2003.
