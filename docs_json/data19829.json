These impurities may detach from the surrounding matrix and even crack\nalong progressive deformation. Due to the consequent incapacity of these undesirable\nparticles of supporting any stress, these ductile materials are equivalently assumed to be\nporous. Porosity has been effectively shown to play a fundamental role in the mechanisms of\nductile fracture. Many micromechanical models have been proposed since the 1970s with the\naim of mathematically describing these mechanisms. Among them, the acclaimed Gurson\nmodel combines the averaging homogenization technique with the kinematic theorem of\nLimit Analysis to estimate the macroscopic yield criterion and porosity evolution law\nof porous ductile materials. However, the Gurson model and most of its extensions only\naccount for isotropic ductile fracture. Thus, the purpose of the present work is to contribute\nto the conception of yield criteria for anisotropic porous ductile rupture. Three main\ncontributions are hereby proposed by profiting from similar hypothesis to those of the\nGurson model. The first contribution is the assessment of the influence of void morphology\non overall yield criteria for those classes of materials. The second is the inclusion of an\nanisotropic yield criterion in the material matrix so that the macroscopic behavior presents\nmatrix-induced anisotropy even for spherical cavities. The third and last advancement\nconsists of generalizing the material matrix yield criterion of the Gurson model in order to\ninclude a linear transformation-based class of yield functions that has been widely used to\nrepresent specific high strength aluminum alloys. The results hereby presented highlight\nthe consistency and robustness of the three formulations. Moreover, the role of the porosity\non the modeling of yield behavior of aluminum alloys encourages further work regarding\nexperimental parameter characterization.\n\nKeywords: Ductile fracture.

Devido \u00e0 consequente incapacidade destas part\u00edculas indesej\u00e1veis\npara suportar qualquer esfor\u00e7o, estes materiais d\u00facteis s\u00e3o equivalentemente assumidos\ncomo sendo porosos. Investiga\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais t\u00eam extensamente mostrado que a\nporosidade desempenha um papel fundamental nos mecanismos de ruptura de materais\nd\u00facteis. Desde a d\u00e9cada de 1970, v\u00e1rios modelos micromec\u00e2nicos t\u00eam sido propostos para\ndescrever esses mecanismos matematicamente. Entre eles, o c\u00e9lebre modelo de Gurson\ncombina a t\u00e9cnica de homogeneiza\u00e7\u00e3o com o teorema cinem\u00e1tico da An\u00e1lise Limite para\nestimar o crit\u00e9rio de plastifica\u00e7\u00e3o macrosc\u00f3pica e a lei de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da porosidade dos\nmateriais d\u00facteis porosos. No entanto, o modelo de Gurson e a maioria de suas extens\u00f5es\nconsideram apenas situa\u00e7\u00f5es de ruptura d\u00factil em meios isotr\u00f3pos. O objetivo do presente\ntrabalho \u00e9, portanto, contribuir para o desenvolvimento de crit\u00e9rios de plastifica\u00e7\u00e3o para a\nruptura d\u00factil de meios porosos anisotr\u00f3pos. Tr\u00eas principais contribui\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o propostas\nneste trabalho, as quais se valem de hip\u00f3teses semelhantes \u00e0s do modelo de Gurson. A\nprimeira contribui\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da influ\u00eancia da morfologia do vazio nos crit\u00e9rios\nde plastifica\u00e7\u00e3o macrosc\u00f3pica desta classe de materiais. A segunda \u00e9 a inclus\u00e3o de um\ncrit\u00e9rio de plastifica\u00e7\u00e3o anisotr\u00f3pico na representa\u00e7\u00e3o da matriz do material, de modo que\no comportamento macrosc\u00f3pico exiba anisotropia induzida por ela, mesmo para cavidades\nesf\u00e9ricas. O terceiro e \u00faltimo avan\u00e7o \u00e9 a generaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do crit\u00e9rio de plasticidade da matriz\nde modo a incluir uma classe de fun\u00e7\u00f5es de plastifica\u00e7\u00e3o baseadas em transforma\u00e7\u00f5es\nlineares. Esta classe de func\u00f5es tem sido amplamente utilizada com sucesso para modelar\nligas de alum\u00ednio de alta resist\u00eancia. Os resultados apresentados neste trabalho atestam a\ncoer\u00eancia e robustez das tr\u00eas formula\u00e7\u00f5es. Al\u00e9m disso, o papel da porosidade na modelagem\nda plasticidade das ligas de alum\u00ednio encoraja trabalhos futuros sobre a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o\nexperimental de par\u00e2metros de anisotropia.\n\nPalavras-chave: Ruptura d\u00factil.

Ces impuret\u00e9s peuvent se d\u00e9tacher de la matrice environnante et\nm\u00eame se fissurer lors d\u2019une d\u00e9formation progressive. En raison de la r\u00e9sultante incapacit\u00e9\nde ces particules ind\u00e9sirables \u00e0 supporter toute contrainte, ces mat\u00e9riaux ductiles sont, de\nmani\u00e8re \u00e9quivalente, suppos\u00e9s \u00eatre poreux. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la porosit\u00e9\njoue un r\u00f4le fondamental dans les m\u00e9canismes de la rupture ductile. Depuis les ann\u00e9es\n1970, de nombreux mod\u00e8les microm\u00e9caniques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9s dans le but de d\u00e9crire\nmath\u00e9matiquement ces m\u00e9canismes. Parmi eux, le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre mod\u00e8le de Gurson combine la\ntechnique d\u2019homog\u00e9n\u00e9isation avec le th\u00e9or\u00e8me cin\u00e9matique de l\u2019analyse limite pour estimer\nle crit\u00e8re de plastification macroscopique et la loi d\u2019\u00e9volution de la porosit\u00e9 des mat\u00e9riaux\nductiles poreux. Cependant, le mod\u00e8le de Gurson, ainsi que la plupart de ses extensions,\nne tient compte que de la rupture ductile isotrope. Le but du pr\u00e9sent travail est donc de\ncontribuer \u00e0 la conception de crit\u00e8res de plastification pour la rupture ductile des milieux\nporeux anisotropes. Trois contributions principales tirant parti d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ses similaires \u00e0\ncelles du mod\u00e8le de Gurson sont ici propos\u00e9es. La premi\u00e8re contribution est l\u2019\u00e9valuation de\nl\u2019influence de la morphologie des vides sur les crit\u00e8res de plastification macroscopique de ces\nclasses de mat\u00e9riaux. La deuxi\u00e8me est l\u2019inclusion d\u2019un crit\u00e8re de plastification anisotrope\ndans la matrice du mat\u00e9riau, de sorte que le comportement macroscopique pr\u00e9sente une\nanisotropie induite par cette matrice, y compris pour les cavit\u00e9s sph\u00e9riques. Le troisi\u00e8me et\ndernier progr\u00e8s consiste \u00e0 g\u00e9n\u00e9raliser le crit\u00e8re de plastification de la matrice afin d\u2019inclure\nune classe de fonctions de plastification bas\u00e9e sur des transformations lin\u00e9aires. Cette\nclasse de fonction a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement employ\u00e9e avec succ\u00e8s pour repr\u00e9senter des alliages\nd\u2019aluminium \u00e0 haute r\u00e9sistance. Les r\u00e9sultats ici pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s soulignent la coh\u00e9rence et la\nrobustesse des trois formulations. En outre, le r\u00f4le de la porosit\u00e9 sur la mod\u00e9lisation de la\nplasticit\u00e9 des alliages d\u2019aluminium incite \u00e0 poursuivre les travaux sur la caract\u00e9risation\nexp\u00e9rimentale des param\u00e8tres d\u2019anisotropie.\n\nMots-cl\u00e9s : Rupture ductile.

For example, it can predict when, where\nand how a fracture may occur and propagate in rivet connections made of aluminum alloys\nin aircraft fuselages. Additionally, it details the perforation process in metallic plates hit\nby projectiles, which indicates the types of alloys that are more appropriate for specific\nmilitary applications. Finally, pinned connections of tall steel towers can be prevented\nto fail by localization of plastic deformations, which could cause serious damage to the\nstructure. These examples illustrate that three of the major contemporary industries\nbenefit from the development of reliable models to understand ductile fracture processes.\n\nThroughout the deformation process of these ductile materials, their mechanical\nproperties may considerably vary. This variation is due to the intense plastic strain fields\nthat concentrate around impurities in their microstructure. On the other hand, these\nconcentration fields deform the surroundings of the impurities so intensely that they\nnormally detach from the material matrix, which creates pores in the microstructure. With\neven more intense loads, these pores become significantly deformed in such a way that\nthe distribution of stresses from grain to grain in the microscale prefer certain directions\ninstead of others. Thus, consistent mathematical descriptions to account for the anisotropy\nalong ductile fracture processes are required.\n\nStudies over the last fifty years demonstrated that microscopic parameters are\ncrucial to understand these ductile rupture processes. Additionally, not only the failure\nprocesses themselves, but also the mechanical behavior of macroscopic structures has been\nshown to be strongly dependent on their microstructure. Thus, a research area called\nmicromechanics has been the subject of important developments since then with the aim of\ntaking into account microstructure parameters in the modeling of conventional engineering\nstructures. This field usually benefits from homogenization techniques so that information\non the constitutive response of highly complex microstructure arrangements can be used\nto generate macroscopically homogeneous material models.\n\nThe aim of this doctoral dissertation is to propose advances on the mathematical\ndescriptions of yield criteria associated to ductile rupture. The models hereby developed\nare based on the acclaimed Gurson model\u2019s framework. To sum up, three contributions\nare presented in this work, all of them focusing solely on effective yield criteria \u2013 therefore,\nthe ongoing evolution in anisotropy with further plastic strain is not taken into account.\nThe first contribution is the investigation of the influence of different void morphologies\non the overall anisotropic behavior of ductile materials. The second one is the inclusion\nof a microscopic anisotropic yield criterion into the original Gurson formulation so that\n\n\n\n30 Chapter 1 Introduction\n\nthe effect of anisotropic material matrices could be accounted for. Finally, the anisotropic\nyield criterion of the material matrix in Gurson\u2019s framework is generalized to linear\ntransformation-based yield functions. Basically, these functions allow anisotropic aluminum\nalloys to be characterized with an arbitrary number of parameters.\n\nA summary of each chapter of the doctoral dissertation is presented below.\n\n\u2022 chapter 2 summarizes the state-of-art of the understanding of ductile rupture. Both\nclassical background and novel tendencies in the field are discussed. The text focuses\non justifying the mechanisms of ductile rupture by appointing the main experimental\nevidence that supports them. Moreover, some analytical and numerical studies are\nalso pointed out in order to complement this evidence. The chapter ends with a brief\noverview of the main inconsistencies in the current understanding of shear-dominated\nfailure of ductile materials that have been reported over the last fifteen years.\n\n\u2022 chapter 3 provides an introduction to the modeling of isotropic porous ductile\nmaterials. The chapter begins by introducing the basic concepts of the averaging\nhomogenization. The Gurson (1975) model is then presented in detail. Some of\nits main phenomenological extensions are also briefly discussed. Finally, with the\naim of providing a basis to the understanding of the next chapters, two analytical\nextensions of the Gurson model are reviewed. The first one is proposed by Benallal,\nDesmorat and Fournage (2014), who assessed the importance of some approximations\nin the original formulation of the Gurson model on the overall macroscopic behavior.\nThe more recent work of Benallal (2017) \u2013 which included the third invariant of\nmicroscopic stress into the matrix yield criterion \u2013 is also detailed and illustrated by\nsome numerical examples.\n\n\u2022 chapter 4 consists of the first contribution of the present doctoral dissertation. Therein,\nan extension of Benallal (2017) is proposed to consider different morphologies of\nthe pores. Both spheroidal and ellipsoidal voids are explored. The results show\nthe consistency of the formulation, as well as the robustness of the numerical\nimplementation. Nevertheless, the anisotropic effect induced by different porous\nmorphologies is limited to high stress triaxialities. This limitation motivated the\ndevelopment of the formulations in chapters 5 and 6.\n\n\u2022 chapter 5 consists of the second contribution to the doctoral dissertation. In this\nchapter, the yield criterion of the material surrounding the pores as considered\nby Benallal (2017) is extended in order to include anisotropic material matrices.\nThis extension relies on the continuum anisotropic yield function of Karafillis and\nBoyce (1993) and includes different material symmetries. Four of them are thereby\nexplored: (i) Cubic; (ii) Transversely Isotropic; (iii) Tetragonal; and (iv) Orthotropic.\nDifferently to chapter 4, the results point out the sensibility of the anisotropic\n\n\n\n31\n\neffects on the material matrix parameters. Besides, the confrontation of orthogonal\nmaterial symmetries demonstrates the physical and mathematical consistency of the\nformulation.\n\n\u2022 chapter 6 consists of the third and last contribution of this doctoral dissertation. A\ngeneralization of the microscopic yield criterion is thereby proposed with the aim of\nrepresenting anisotropic material matrices that follow Barlat et al. (2005). Basically,\nthis work provided a framework to compose yield functions that can include an\narbitrary number of anisotropy parameters to be experimentally determined. This\nmodel has been widely confirmed as being an adequate formulation for continuous \u2013\nnot porous \u2013 modeling of aluminum alloys. Thus, chapter 6 contributes to the field\nby inserting this acclaimed model into a Gurson-like formulation for porous ductile\nmaterials. The results show a remarkable influence of the porosity on the overall\nmacroscopic yield criterion and encourages further experimental characterization\nwork of porous aluminum alloys.\n\n\u2022 chapter 7 provides some details on the numerical implementation of the formulation\ncontained in chapters 4, 5 and 6. The covered aspects are: (i) the numerical integration\nprocedure for obtaining macroscopic yield criteria; (ii) the discretization procedure\nof the macroscopic strain rate variables; and (iii) an interpolation-based procedure\nfor obtaining level-set (or contour) plots of three-dimensional yield surfaces.\n\n\u2022 chapter 8 finally depicts the advantages and deficiencies of the three formulations\nproposed in this doctoral dissertation. Moreover, it links some of the these deficiencies\nto further work that must be carried out in the near future.\n\nThree appendix sections contain complementary details on the formulations and\nnumerical implementation hereby developed:\n\n\u2022 Appendix A summarizes some practical aspects of the Voigt notation for symmetric\ntensor operations. This notation was used throughout every implementation of this\ndoctoral dissertation with the aim of saving computation time.\n\n\u2022 Appendix B proposes a numerical N-dimensional procedure to obtain level-set (or\ncontour) plots of N-dimensional surfaces, with applications in Mechanics of Materials.\nThis procedure is a generalization of that presented in section 7.3 for two-dimensional\nsurfaces described in three-dimensional spaces.\n\n\u2022 Appendix C lists the auxiliary derivatives that are required for the implementation\nof Eq. (6.16), (6.28) and (6.29).\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n2 AN OVERVIEW OF DUCTILE RUPTURE\n\n2.1 Classical background\n\nThis section summarizes some important concepts about the classical view of\nductile fracture. Its emphasis is to present both pioneering studies on key concepts and\nsome of the most significant contributions to the understanding of specific phenomena. The\ntext is strongly based on the reviews by Hahn, Kanninen and Rosenfield (1972), Schwalbe\n(1977), Stone et al. (1985), Garrison Jr and Moody (1987), Benzerga and Leblond (2010)\nand Besson (2010). Much richer and vaster overviews can be found in their works.\n\n2.1.1 Nucleation: the genesis of voids\n\nThe manufacturing processes of steels and alloys generally result in undesirable\nsmall non-metallic particles in their microstructures. These particles are commonly called\neither second-phase particles, because of their different chemical composition to the grains\nthat compose most of the texture, or inclusions, due to their undesirable presence. They\ncan be classified into two main types. The first is called endogenous and refers to particles\nthat arise from the chemical reactions in the melt. The second type is exogenous and\nrepresents inclusions that enter the melt during pouring. While endogenous particles are\ntypically small and dispersed throughout the material, the exogenous ones vary in size\nand tend to be concentrated in specific regions of the casting (BEELEY, 2001).\n\nDue to geometric aspects of the microstructure and to the non-metallic character\nof inclusions, the stress and plastic deformation tend to concentrate around them when\nthe ductile material is under load. Then, two very important mechanisms may occur. The\nfirst one is the decohesion of the particle\u2013matrix interface as a consequence of the intense\nplastic flow along the interface. Since it implies that the particle is no longer attached to\nthe surrounding matrix, the particle can no longer contribute to the material\u2019s mechanical\nstiffness. Thus, it is equivalently assumed that a void is generated in the same position as\nthe original inclusion. This phenomenon is called nucleation by particle\u2013matrix decohesion\nand was first documented by Tipper (1948\u201349 apud GARRISON JR; MOODY, 1987).\nThen, Puttick (1959) observed it by studying copper and iron notched specimens under\ntensile loading. Following the conclusions of Wilcox and Clauer (1972) and Gurland (1972),\nthe particle\u2013matrix decohesion is likely to arise first in larger particles.\n\nThe second nucleation mechanism takes place when the particle itself \u2013 and not\nthe interface as in the earlier case \u2013 cannot support the stress concentration imposed to it.\nTherefore, the particle cracks and can no longer add any stiffness to the material. In the\n\n\n\n34 Chapter 2 An overview of ductile rupture\n\nsame way as the first case, it is thus equivalently assumed that the particle is substituted\nby a cavity. This mechanism is known as nucleation by particle cracking and one of the\nfirst experimental pieces of evidences were given by Puttick (1959). More recently, Agarwal\net al. (2002) observed that the process of intermetallic particle cracking of an aluminum\nalloy (6061\u2013T651) presented anisotropy behavior due to the rotation of particles during\nuniaxial compression tests.\n\nBabout et al. (2004) investigated the hardness effect of aluminum alloys on void\nnucleation in tensile tests. For this purpose, a structural 2124 aluminum alloy and a\ncommercially pure aluminum were chosen to represent a hard and a soft matrix, respectively.\nIn short, they found that particle cracking generally prevails in materials with a hard\nmatrix, while particle\u2013matrix decohesion is associated to softer ones. Other trends about\nthe competition of these two nucleation mechanisms are presented by Benzerga and\nLeblond (2010). Among them, it has been found that particle cracking is related to higher\n(i) matrix yield strength; (ii) matrix hardening exponent; and (iii) particle elongation\nalong the tensile test. On the other hand, particle\u2013matrix decohesion is normally linked to\n(v) higher particle stiffness and (vi) to transverse loadings.\n\n2.1.2 Void growth\n\nAfter nucleation, the progress of the loading level continues to concentrate plastic\ndeformations in portions of the matrix around voids, which causes permanent changes in\ntheir boundaries. Due to this phenomenon, the voids can grow and evolve their shapes. This\nmechanism is then called void growth. The earlier experimental investigations that treated\nvoid growth was presented by Ashby (1966), Ashby and Johnson (1969) and Ashby (1970).\nThe first work stated that the void growth is described mainly by dislocation motions\nof grains around the voids. The author also proposed a dislocation-based expression for\nthe estimation of void growth. However, Rosenfield (1968) concluded that the predictions\nprovided by this expression was indeed small. Additionally, the hypothesis of the dislocation\ninfluence was found not to be enough to completely describe the void growth phenomenon.\n\nThe mechanism of void growth was also introduced and explored by some studies\nbased on analytical developments in continuum mechanics. Firstly, McClintock, Kaplan\nand Berg (1966) developed a fracture criterion for the growth of cylindrical voids immersed\nin a viscous (or plastic by a thereby specific approximation) infinite media under shear\nloading with a superimposed mean stress. McClintock (1968a) and McClintock (1968b)\n(errata) then generalized the earlier work and proposed a criterion for ductile fracture due\nto the growth of cylindrical holes under arbitrary history of load. Their main conclusions\nhighlighted the strong influence of (i) the tensile stress transverse to the void elongation\non the fracture strain (i.e. ductility); (ii) intermediate principal stress also on the fracture\nstrain; and the history of stress and strain on ductile fracture.\n\n\n\n2.1 Classical background 35\n\nTwo other very important studies \u2013 also based on continuum mechanics approaches\n\u2013 contributed to understanding of void growth. Rice and Tracey (1969) studied the enlarge-\nment of spherical cavities in an infinite perfectly rigid\u2013plastic medium under remote tensile\nstress with a superposed hydrostatic one. Their work concluded that there exists high\ndependence of void growth on the stress triaxiality, as well as an exponentially decrease\nof the fracture strain with increasing triaxiality. Then, Tracey (1971) went further by\ncontinuing the same path as the earlier work. He investigated the effects of the hardening\nexponent and interaction between voids within a similar framework to Rice and Tracey\n(1969). His conclusions indicated the decelerating influence of the hardening exponent\non the void enlargement and the need for accounting for large strain theory for further\ninvestigation on the effect of interaction between voids.\n\n2.1.3 Coalescence: the linkage between voids\n\nThe next stage of the classical view of ductile rupture consists of the linkage of\nadjacent voids due to the intersection of their boundaries and the consequent formation of\nmicrocracks. This stage is called coalescence and may occur due to four main mechanisms:\n(i)internal necking; (ii) microshear bands (or \"void sheets\"); (iii) necklace; and (iv) inter-\ngranular cracking. This propagation of a microcrack by coalescence is found to evolve in a\nvery short time interval when compared to the mechanisms cited above, as documented\nby Broek (1973).\n\nThe internal necking occurs due to the enlargement of two adjacent cavities until\ntheir boundaries collapse and form only one larger cavity (Fig. 1a, 4a and 5a). The term\n\"necking\" refers to the high plastic deformations in the region between two voids just before\nthey become linked. This mechanism was first suggested by Henry (1855 apud ARGON;\nIM; SAFOGLU, 1975) and, since the advent of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for\nmechanics in the 1950s, it has been unequivocally accepted.\n\nCoalescence by formation of a void sheet arises from the nucleation of smaller \u2013 but\nnumerous \u2013 secondary voids oriented following a shear band localization between two larger\nand distant voids (Fig. 1b and 4c). Cox and Low (1974) presented their classical result for\na tensile test of an AISI 4340 steel (Fig. 5c). In their experiment, metallography analyses\nled to the conclusion that larger voids were nucleated firstly at manganese sulfide particles.\nThese voids enlarged until a critical point from which smaller particles of carbides started\nto nucleate in the narrow band between the larger voids. Although these secondary voids\nwere much smaller, they were numerous enough so that a void sheet could be formed\nby a dense arrangement of microvoids. At the final stage of their experiment, this void\nsheet linked the initial two larger voids and then created a macrocrack. The formation of\nmicroscopic shear band localization in single crystals was further investigated by Asaro\n(1979) and Pegel et al. (1980). Later, Moody and Greulich (1985) also observed a formation\n\n\n\n36 Chapter 2 An overview of ductile rupture\n\nof slip band fracture by void sheet coalescence of carbides in a Fe-Ni-Co superalloy.\n\nFigure 1: An illustration of the coalescence mechanisms by internal necking and by void sheeting.\n\nIn Fig. 1a, two voids become linked due to their enlargement until their boundaries collapse by\nforming only one larger void. In Fig. 1b, two larger and more distant voids become jointed by\nthe nucleation of smaller voids aligned with a shear band. Source: (BESSON, 2010).\n\nNecklace (also known as coalescence in columns) is a peculiar coalescence mechanism\ndiscovered by Benzerga (2000). He observed a formation of vertical void sheets in uniaxial\nloading tests of steel specimens. Differently to the microshear bands, these sheets resulted\nfrom the alignment of elongated manganese sulfide particles following the loading axis\ndirection. Consequently, these voids continued to become even more elongated throughout\nthe increase of the load level until such a point that, even though the particular volume\nfraction of each void was small, the voids were linked due to the coincidence of intense\nelongation of them in the same \"columns\" (i.e. loading axis direction). This mechanism\nwas also perceived in uniaxially loaded steel notched bars in Benzerga, Besson and Pineau\n(2004).\n\nFinally, coalescence by intergranular fracture consists of a microcrack propagation\nby adjacent particle interfaces. Distinctly to internal necking, it is generally caused by\na deficient resistance of the particle boundaries due to a chemical action of a hostile\nenvironment (DOWLING, 2013). Additionally, this mechanism also tends to occur in high\nstrength aluminum alloys in which both the matrix and the particles themselves are too\nstiff compared to their interfaces (LUDTKA; LAUGHLIN, 1982).\n\n2.1.4 Considerations about ductility\n\nThe influence of certain parameters on the ductility has been also assessed by\nseveral experimental and analytical\u2013numerical studies. Increasing stress triaxialities (T , Eq.\n(2.1)) from the value of 1/3, were shown to decrease strain failure, according to numerous\nstudies (e.g. (RICE; TRACEY, 1969) and (AGOGINO, 1978)). The specific value of\nT = 1/3 refers to the initial conditions of a uniaxial tensile test in round smooth bars (i.e.\n?2 = ?3 = 0 in Eq. (2.1)), according to Benzerga and Leblond (2010).\n\n\n\n2.1 Classical background 37\n\nThe stress Lode parameter \u00b5 (defined in Eq. (2.2)) is found to also decrease ductility\nwhen its value approximates zero, which corresponds to a pure shear condition in the plane\n1\u20133, according to Bao and Wierzbicki (2004), Barsoum and Faleskog (2007b), Barsoum\nand Faleskog (2007c), Barsoum and Faleskog (2007a), Barsoum and Faleskog (2011) and\nBarsoum, Faleskog and Pingle (2011). The reasons for this is still a matter of intense\nresearch.\n\nT =\n?m\n?eq\n\n=\n?1 + ?2 + ?3\n\n3?\n1\n2\n\n[(?1 ??2)2 + (?2 ??3)2 + (?3 ??1)2]\n? [??,?] (2.1)\n\n\u00b5 =\n2?2 ??1 ??3\n\n?1 ??3\n? [?1, 1] (2.2)\n\nwhere ?1, ?2 and ?3 are the principal macroscopic stresses.\n\nThe influence of initial porosity (or equivalently volume fraction of particles) has\nbeen widely recognized as well. It is well-known that the increasing initial porosity causes\ndecreasing failure strain. This conclusion was first reported in the experimental studies of\nLentz (1978), Speich and Spitzig (1982) and Spitzig (1985). Then, Bourcier et al. (1986)\ndedicated a whole study to assess the effect of initial porosity on the fracture process of\ntitanium alloys with different hardening behaviors. They concluded that the concentration\nof porosity in certain regions of their specimens led to localization-induced cracks.\n\nThe orientation of elongated particles was also a subject of investigation in the\n1970s. Bernard, Grumbach and Moliexe (1975) and Wilson (1979) studied short-transverse\nductility of steel plates and fatigue properties of a carbon plate steel A516\u201370, respectively.\nTheir works agreed that the more an elongated void was transversely oriented to the\nrolling direction, the less ductile the materials became.\n\n2.1.5 Reference values of critical porosities\n\nThe overall porosity f? of a given material is defined as an estimation of the average\nof volume fraction of every void. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that a critical porosity f?c\nis related to the beginning of a coalescence process and, thus, to the final stage of ductile\nrupture itself.\n\nFollowing this idea, estimations of f?c have been consistently proposed in the\nliterature. Nowadays, there is consensus that, for most ductile rupture conditions, the\ncritical porosity may vary in f?c ? [? 1%,? 2%], according to Marino, Mudry and Pineau\n(1985), Pardoen and Delannay (1998), Benzerga, Besson and Pineau (2004) and Benzerga,\nBesson and Pineau (2004).\n\n\n\n38 Chapter 2 An overview of ductile rupture\n\n2.2 Recent investigations\n\nIn the last 15 years, many efforts have been devoted to better explaining some incon-\nsistencies between experimental observations regarding ductile failure in shear-dominated\nloadings (i.e. ?1/3 ? T ? 1/3 and \u00b5 ? 0). The classical works that performed tensile\ntests, generally on round smooth or notched bars, assured that the failure strain decreases\nfor increasing stress triaxialities T from 1/3 on (e.g. the work of Hancock and Mackenzie\n(1976)). These results are in agreement with the predictions provided by the analytical\nwork of Rice and Tracey (1969). Additionally, in the 1980s, Johnson and Cook (1985) found\nthat ductility continued to increase with decreasing positive triaxialities below T = 1/3.\n\nHowever, Bao and Wierzbicki (2004) obtained a very different outcome from a\nseries of tests on a 2024-T351 aluminum alloy. They found that the ductility decreased\nfor decreasing triaxialities below T ? 1/3 and that it reached a minimum in the vicinities\nof the level T = 0. Notwithstanding, the ductility then increased quickly for decreasing\nvalues of T ? 0, as illustrated in Fig. 2.\n\nFigure 2: The relation between fracture strain and stress triaxiality for tests on a 2024-T351\naluminum alloy.\n\nFor a decreasing stress triaxiality T, Bao and Wierzbicki (2004) obtained (i) an increasing\nductility until T ? 0.4; (ii) a decreasing ductility until it reached a minimum level at T ? 0; and\na rapidly increasing ductility for ?1/3 ? T ? 0. Source: (BAO; WIERZBICKI, 2004).\n\nThe scientific community promptly proposed some explanations. Teng and Wierzbicki\n\n\n\n2.2 Recent investigations 39\n\n(2006) proposed that (i) a void growth mechanism should prevail in the region T ? 1/3\nand (ii) a shear-decohesion should predominantly occur for T &lt;1/3. Later, Barsoum\nand Faleskog (2007b), Barsoum and Faleskog (2007c) and Barsoum and Faleskog (2011)\nproposed that ductile fracture should be developed by a combination of the mechanisms\nof intervoid necking (Fig. 4a and 5a) and intervoid shearing (Fig. 4b and 5b).\n\nNevertheless, more inconsistencies have been continually reported in the present\ndecade. For example, Ghahremaninezhad and Ravi-Chandar (2013) obtained a shear-\ndominated failure mode on a 6061-T6 aluminum alloy that apparently did not involve any\ninfluence of coalescence of voids. Additionally, increasing ductility related to a decreasing\nstress triaxiality was observed by Ghahremaninezhad and Ravi-Chandar (2012), Ghahre-\nmaninezhad and Ravi-Chandar (2013), Haltom, Kyriakides and Ravi-Chandar (2013) and\nScales, Tardif and Kyriakides (2016).\n\nThe interaction between coalescence and localization phenomenon was investigated\nby Teko?lu, Hutchinson and Pardoen (2015). They performed 3D FEM calculations\non an elastoplastic periodic cell to find out whether these two mechanisms occurred\nsimultaneously. They concluded that (i) for increasing stress triaxialities, coalescence and\nlocalization tend not to occur at the same time; and (ii) for triaxialities near zero, these\nmechanisms tend to occur simultaneously.\n\nThe influence of the Lode parameter on the evolution of porosity in ductile materials\nwas studied by Danas and Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (2012). They used a second order nonlinear\nhomogenization method of Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (2002a) to obtain the effective response of\nporous materials under different loading conditions. They remarked that the effect of the\nLode parameter \u00b5 is more significant at the evolution of porosity than at the effective\nyield surfaces. Moreover, their results showed that the lowest failure strain coincided\nwith a Lode parameter \u00b5 = 1, while no void collapse was observed for the axisymmetric\ncondition of \u00b5 = ?1. However, Hutchinson and Tvergaard (2012) argued that 3D FEM\ncalculations \u2013 as in Bao and Wierzbicki (2004) \u2013 indicate that the minimum ductility\nshould not coincide with \u00b5 = 1. According to them, some analytical considerations in\nDanas and Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (2012) could have erroneously influenced this result.\n\nDunand and Mohr (2014) performed several 3D FEM analysis of periodic cells \u2013\nincluding contact and large strain theory \u2013 to assess the influence of the Lode angle on the\nlocalization at low triaxialities. Some of their results are shown in Fig. 3. Each black dot in\nthis figure represents a proportional loading, keeping constant both stress triaxiality and\nLode angle, that led the cell to a localization pattern. They found that the failure strain\nis a convex function of both the stress Lode angle and triaxiality. Besides, Fig. 3 reveals\nthat the localization phenomenon does not occur for stress triaxialities approximately in\nthe range of T ? [0, 0.18]. Furthermore, for around T ? [0.18, 0.6], the development of\nlocalization relies on a specific variation of the Lode angle as a function of the triaxiality.\n\n\n\n40 Chapter 2 An overview of ductile rupture\n\nFigure 3: Failure strain associated to the occurrence of plastic localization as function of the\nstress triaxiality ? and the stress Lode angle ?, according to Dunand and Mohr (2014).\n\nEach black dot corresponds to a 3D FEM calculation of a periodic porous material under a\nproportional loading that led the cell to a failure due to localization. Note: Due to different\nnomenclatures in their manuscript, ? represents the stress triaxiality T, while ? to the stress\nLode angle ?. Source: (DUNAND; MOHR, 2014)\n\nIn a very recent work, Noell, Carroll and Boyce (2018) proposed an extended\ngroup of seven mechanisms that should play a role in different ductile rupture conditions.\nAccording to them, these mechanisms may not only compete with one another \u2013 as in\nthe sense of Barsoum\u2019s view \u2013, but they may facilitate the occurrence of other ones.\nMoreover, these mechanisms can also work sequentially in a progressive load to rupture of\na material. These mechanisms are illustrated by schematic representations, in Fig. 4, and\nby experimental observations provided by the literature in Fig 5. Since Noell, Carroll and\nBoyce (2018) limited their experimental investigations to high-purity copper, nickel and\naluminum, further works are required to validate their hypothesis to structural engineering\n\n\n\n2.2 Recent investigations 41\n\nmaterials and high-strength alloys.\n\nFigure 4: A schematic illustration of the seven mechanisms of ductile rupture proposed by Noell,\nCarroll and Boyce (2018).\n\nCoalescence-based mechanisms: (a) coalescence by adjacent enlarged voids until their boundaries\ncollapse into a larger unique void; (b) coalescence by a nucleation of small voids that are aligned\nto a shear band localization; and (c) linkage of two larger voids by the nucleation of smaller and\nnumerous ones following the direction of one or more shear bands.

Basically, he\ncombines the averaging homogenization technique with the kinematic approach of Limit\nAnalysis theorem to analytically formulate a continuum constitutive model for porous\nductile materials that couples yield criterion and damage evolution. Since then, several\nextensions of this model \u2013 some purely phenomenological and other numerical/analytical \u2013\nhave been proposed in order to overcome some of its limitations. Among these, some of the\nmost important work to the field, and also useful to the understanding of the contributions\nof this doctoral dissertation, are hereby presented. Moreover, the basic concepts about the\naveraging homogenization technique and the notations used throughout this document \u2013\nnot only in this chapter \u2013 are resumed in the first section.\n\n3.1 Preliminaries\n\n3.1.1 Tensorial and matrix algebra notations\n\nThroughout this document, most mathematical expressions are written following\nan intrinsic or index tensorial notation. Scalar quantities are represented by regular weight\nletters (e.g. ?, ?, r, R). First and second-order tensors are referred to in bold letters (e.g.\n?, ??, E?). Their precise orders are indicated in the text and may also be inferred by the\ncontext. Fourth-order tensors are written in cursive letters (e.g. L, C).\n\nWhenever needed, additional notation is also used in some sections in order to avoid\nambiguities between matrices and vectors. A matrix algebra notation is then conveniently\nadopted in certain sections concerning aspects of numerical implementation. According to\nthis notation, a scalar variable is still represented by regular letters (e.g. C, ?, ?). However,\nvectors and matrices are still written in bold, but hold respectively one and two underlines\n(e.g. vectors are ??, ??, while matrices are L, C).\n\nThe numerical implementation of products involving symmetric high-order tensors\nrequires an equivalent matrix algebra representation so that the unnecessary operations are\navoided. For this purpose, the well-known Voigt notation is used in order to conveniently\ntreat tensor operations as matrix\u2013vector relations. Some details about this notation are\ngiven in Appendix A.\n\n\n\n44 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions\n\n3.1.2 A brief overview of the averaging homogenization technique\n\nIn general terms, homogenization techniques offer approaches for modeling het-\nerogeneous media (i.e. consisting of more than one material) by defining an equivalent,\nbut hypothetical, homogeneous medium. However, in most engineering materials, the\nheterogeneities are arbitrarily distributed on microscale, which does not allow that every\nheterogeneity be accounted for. In order to avoid this inconvenience, Hill (1963) proposed\nthat a heterogeneous medium could be consistently represented by its smallest material\nportion that contains every relevant property of the material. This portion is commonly\ncalled Representative Volume Element (RVE) or Representative Elementary Volume (REV).\nAccording to Besson et al. (2010), the validity of this idealization is guaranteed for most\ncases if the characteristic lengths (i) lRV E of the RVE; (ii) lstruct of the engineering structure\nto be modeled; and (iii) lload of the load fluctuations applied to the final structure satisfy\n\nlRV E ? lstruct\nlRV E ? lload.\n\n(3.1)\n\nBased on the RVE concept, the equivalence between the real heterogeneous material\n(represented by the RVE) and the fictitious homogeneous one is achieved by averaging the\nmicroscopic (i.e. pointwise in the RVE) stress and strain fields in the domain ? \u2013 including\nheterogeneities, voids, inclusions \u2013 (Fig. 6). These averaged tensors are then assumed to\nbe those of the hypothetical homogeneous material. The average of a statically admissible\n(i.e. equilibrated) microscopic stress field ?? in the domain ? of the RVE is\n\n  \n\n??+?m\n\n?1 ?2\n\n?3 ?4\n\nFigure 6: An illustration of an arbitrary RVE containing four heterogeneities.\n\nThe illustrated RVE contains four arbitrary heterogeneities enumerated from 1 to 4. The\nmaterial matrix is represented by ?m, while ?i represents the interior of the i-th heterogeneity.\nThe boundary ??+ denotes the outer surface of the RVE. The total domain ? is defined as\n? = ?m ??1 ??2 ??3 ??4. This RVE representation is taken as two-dimensional for the sake\nof simplicity and distinctness. However, the RVEs used in the next sections of this document are\nassumed to be three-dimensional, as will be indicated later on. Source: the author.\n\n&lt;? >=\n1\nV\n\n?\n?\n?dV.

(3.3)\n\nThe integrals in Eq. (3.2) and (3.3) can be equivalently evaluated in the external\nboundary ??+ by using the Divergence Theorem. For this, one must also verify that,\nconsidering no volume forces and small strains theory,\n\n(?ikxj),k = ?ik,kxj + ?ikxj,k = ?ij\nand\n\n?ij =\n1\n2\n\n(u??i,j + u?j,i).\n\nThe Eq. (3.2) and (3.3) can be then transformed into\n\n&lt;? >ij=\n1\nV\n\n?\n?\n?ijdV =\n\n1\nV\n\n?\n?\n\n(?ikxj),kdV =\n1\nV\n\n?\n??+\n\n?ikxknjdS (3.4)\n\nand\n\n&lt;?? >ij=\n1\nV\n\n?\n?\n??ijdV =\n\n1\nV\n\n?\n?\n\n1\n2\n\n(u?i,j + u?j,i)dV =\n1\n\n2V\n\n?\n??+\n\n(u?inj + u?jni)dS. (3.5)\n\nwhere n(x) is the normal unitary vector to the outer surface ??+ at the point x ? ??+.\n\nAlthough the averaging process is straightforward, an equally important \u2013 but more\ncomplicated \u2013 task is the definition of the boundary conditions to the RVE problem. These\nboundary conditions must represent as accurately as possible the actual situation in which\nthe microscopic portion of material is subjected. However, it is a very complex task due\nto the arbitrary distribution of the heterogeneities and the impossibility of determining\nthe precise stress and strain field acting on the planes of interaction between two material\nportions. Two idealizations regarding these questions were then proposed by Hill (1963):\n(i) uniform stress field on the external boundary ??+ (Eq. (3.6)); and (ii) uniform strain\nfield on the external boundary ??+ (Eq. (3.7)).\n\nFd(x) = ? \u00b7n(x) x ? ??+, (3.6)\n\nwhere Fd(x) is the traction vector applied at x ? ??+ and ? is a uniform (i.e. constant)\nmacroscopic stress tensor applied on ??+.\n\nu?d(x) = E? \u00b7x x ? ??+ (3.7)\n\n\n\n46 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions\n\nwhere u?d(x) is the velocity vector at x ? ??+ and E? is a uniform (i.e. constant)\nmacroscopic strain rate tensor applied on ??+.\n\nThese two types of boundary conditions lead to relevant conclusions. The first\none is that the boundary condition of uniform stress implies the average &lt;? > to equal\nthe applied macroscopic stress ?. Similarly, the second one is that uniform strain in\n??+ causes &lt;?? >= E?. These two results can save computational effort in numerical\nimplementations involving one of these assumptions. They can also be easily verified by\nconsidering Eq. (3.4) and (3.5).\n\nThe strain energy density may also be conveniently averaged in the domain of\nthe RVE. Thanks to the Hill-Mandel lemma ((HILL, 1967) and (MANDEL, 1972 apud\nZAOUI, 2002)), the average strain energy density can be equivalently evaluated as\n\n&lt;? : ?? >=&lt;? >:&lt;?? > . (3.8)\n\nThroughout this document, the adjective macroscopic indicates that a certain field\n(stress and strain rate) is averaged in the domain ? of an RVE, even though its precise\nmeaning is related to uniform fields that are imposed as boundary conditions on ??.\nAdditionally, the term effective is also used by meaning averaged.\n\n3.1.3 Microscopic quantities\n\nIn the present text, the microscopic stress tensor is represented by ?. This tensor\nis conveniently decomposed in terms of its three stress invariants: (i) the hydrostatic (or\nmean) stress ?m; (ii) the von Mises (or equivalent) measure of stress ?eq; and (iii) the Lode\nangle ?. The microscopic stress tensor can then be written as\n\n? = ?eqe?(?) + ?m1, (3.9)\n\nwhere\n?m =\n\n1\n3\n\nTr ?, (3.10)\n\n?? = ???m1, (3.11)\n\n?eq =\n?\n\n3\n2\n?? : ??, (3.12)\n\ne?(?) =\n\n?\n??????\n\ncos ? 0 0\n0 cos\n\n(\n? ?\n\n2?\n3\n\n)\n0\n\n0 0 cos\n(\n? +\n\n2?\n3\n\n)\n?\n?????? , (3.13)\n\n\n\n3.1 Preliminaries 47\n\n? =\n1\n3\n\narccos\n(\n\n27\n2\n\ndet ??\n?3eq\n\n)\n(3.14)\n\nand 1 is the identity matrix of order three.\n\nSimilarly, the microscopic strain rate ?? is hereby written in terms of its three\ninvariants: (i) the hydrostatic (or mean) strain rate ??m; (ii) the equivalent measure of\nstrain ??eq; and (iii) the Lode angle ? as\n\n?? = ??eqe\n? + ??m1, (3.15)\n\nwhere\n??m =\n\n1\n3\n\nTr ??, (3.16)\n\n??? = ?? ? ??m1 (3.17)\n\n??eq =\n?\n\n3\n2\n??? : ???, (3.18)\n\ne? =\n\n?\n??????\n\ncos ? 0 0\n0 cos\n\n(\n? ?\n\n2?\n3\n\n)\n0\n\n0 0 cos\n(\n? +\n\n2?\n3\n\n)\n?\n?????? , (3.19)\n\n? =\n1\n3\n\narccos\n(\n\n4 det ???\n??3eq\n\n)\n(3.20)\n\nAs the following chapters deal with incompressible material matrices, the hydrostatic\nstrain rate is nulled in the equations above (i.e ??m = 0).\n\n3.1.4 Macroscopic quantities\n\nThe macroscopic stress and strain rate are represented by ? and E?, respectively.\nAnalogously to the previous subsection, the macroscopic stress is defined in terms of\nits invariants (i) macroscopic hydrostatic stress ?m (or, equivalently, the macroscopic\nstress triaxiality T ? [??,?]); (ii) the deviatoric macroscopic stress; (iii) von Mises (or\nequivalent) macroscopic stress ?eq; and (iv) the macroscopic stress Lode angle ?:\n\n? =\n2\n3\n?eqe\n\n?(?) + ?m1\n\n= ?eq\n[2\n3\ne?(?) + T1\n\n] (3.21)\n\n\n\n48 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions\n\nwhere\n?m =\n\n1\n3\n\nTr ?, (3.22)\n\n?? = ? ??m1, (3.23)\n\n?eq =\n?\n\n3\n2\n?? : ??, (3.24)\n\ne?(?) =\n\n?\n??????\n\ncos ? 0 0\n0 cos\n\n(\n? ?\n\n2?\n3\n\n)\n0\n\n0 0 cos\n(\n? +\n\n2?\n3\n\n)\n?\n?????? , (3.25)\n\nT =\n?m\n?eq\n\n(3.26)\n\nand\n? =\n\n1\n3\n\narccos\n(\n\n27\n2\n\ndet ??\n?3eq\n\n)\n(3.27)\n\nFinally, the macroscopic strain rate tensor E? is also described as a function\nof its three invariants: (i) hydrostatic strain rate E?m (or, equivalently, the triaxiality\nH ?

The first is called deviatoric plane (or\neven ?-plane or Nadai\u2019s plane). It consists of an intersection of the yield surface with a\nplane that is orthogonal to the hydrostatic axis for a prescribed value ?m = ??m, as Fig. 7\nillustrates for a hypothetical yield stress.\n\n?1\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n? m\n\n?2 ?1\n\n?3\n\n1\n2\n\n3 4 1\n2\n\n3 4\n\nFigure 7: Illustration of the meaning of deviatoric planes of macroscopic yield surfaces.\n\nSource: the author.\n\nThe second useful family of planes is called meridional planes. A meridional plane,\nin the context of yield surfaces, corresponds to two given values of stress Lode angles: (i)\n? = ?? to obtain a semi-plan; and (ii) ? = ?? + ? to its complementary semi-plan. In Fig.\n8, the prescription of ? = ?? may be understood as the upper quadrants of the meridional\ncurves (?eq ? 0); and ? = ?? + ?, to ?eq &lt;0.\n\n3.2 The Gurson Yield Criterion\n\nIn the 1970s, Gurson (1975) and Gurson (1977) formulated a model with the aim of\ndescribing isotropic ductile rupture by an adequate constitutive model to be implemented\nwithin recurrent engineering problems. His approach starts by conceiving two main RVE\nconfigurations: (i) a hollow sphere with a centered spherical cavity inside it; and (ii) a\ncylinder with an also aligned cylindrical void contained in it. The spherical RVE was\n\n\n\n50 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions\n\n?1\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n? m\n\n?m\n\n  ?eq\n\nFigure 8: Illustration of the meaning of meridional planes of macroscopic yield surfaces.\n\nSource: the author.\n\nchosen to represent materials whose particles in microscale are arbitrarily distributed (i.e.\nmacroscopic isotropy). The second RVE was taken to simulate materials whose defects in\nmicroscale are distributed with a preferred direction. Although both models were proposed\nin his doctoral dissertation, the spherical model has received much more attention in the\nliterature. Accordingly, the present work explores only the spherical approach from here\non.\n\nThe material matrix in a vicinity of the void is assumed to be continuous and\n(i) to follow von Mises criterion of plastification; (ii) to hold the normality rule for the\nplastic flow; (iii) not to present any hardening rule (i.e perfectly plastic material); and (iv)\nto undergo solely plastic deformation (i.e. rigid-plastic material).

The macroscopic strain rate E? is imposed in the external surface by the relation\n\nu? = E? \u00b7x. (3.39)\n\nAdditionally, the void surface requires another boundary condition. For this purpose,\nGurson assumed that the void surface was traction-free. This assumption can be regarded\nas a uniform stress boundary condition in ???:\n\nFd(x) = 0, x ? ??? (3.40)\n\nwhere Fd(x) is the traction vector on the void surface.\n\nThe microscopic dissipation potential ? can then be defined as a function of a\nmicroscopic stress field ? and an traceless microscopic strain rate field ?? as\n\n?(??) = sup\n???\n{? : ??} (3.41)\n\nwhere ? = {?|?(?) =? ?0} is a convex set of statically admissible stress tensors ? and\n?(?) is homogenous of degree one.\n\nThe combination of the normality rule for the flow of the microscopic plastic strain\nrate ?? = ????/?? with the first degree homogeneity of the yield function ?(?), Eq.

According to this kinematic condition,\nthe microscopic strain rate ?? must respect the essential boundary condition, which is, in\nthe Gurson\u2019s RVE problem, imposed on the outer surface (i.e. ??(R,?,?) = E?). From Eq.\n(3.18) and (3.36), the plastic multiplier rate then satisfies\n\n?? =\n??eq?\n\n2\n3\n??\n\n??\n:\n??\n\n??\n\n=\n??eq????2\n\n3\n\n(\n3\n2\n??\n\n?eq\n\n)\n:\n(\n\n3\n2\n??\n\n?eq\n\n) = ??eq?eq?3\n2\n?? : ??\n\n= ??eq. (3.43)\n\nIt follows from Eq. (3.42) and (3.43) that the microscopic plastic dissipation ?(??)\nmay thus be written in terms of only the compatible strain rate field ??? as\n\n?(??) = ?0??eq (3.44)\n\n\n\n3.2 The Gurson Yield Criterion 53\n\nand the macroscopic plastic dissipation potential is then derived by an average in the RVE\nvolume as\n\n? =\n1\nV\n\n?\n?\n?0??\n?\neqdV. (3.45)\n\nThe solution to the RVE (i.e. the velocity or strain rate field) can be obtained by a\nminimization of the macroscopic plastic dissipation potential ? in Eq. (3.45). However,\nthis minimization procedure would result in too much of a complex description to use in\ncommon engineering situations.\n\nGurson (1975) then proposed that the solution could be approximated in a conve-\nnient way by carefully choosing a trial strain rate field ??G. This field would constitute an\nupperbound approximated solution to the minimization of ? based on kinematic theorem\nof Limit Analysis. It means that, by evaluating ? in Eq. (3.45) with a compatible ??? \u2013\nbut different to the exact solution ?? \u2013 the resultant dissipation should be certainly greater\nthan the exact dissipation calculated with ??.\n\nThe Gurson\u2019s trial strain rate field ??G relied on the contemporary results obtained\nby McClintock (1968a) and Rice and Tracey (1969). According to these authors, the ductile\nfracture is strongly dependent on the stress triaxiality. Gurson then idealized that the\nkinematically admissible velocity field u?G could be decomposed into two parts. The first,\nu?VG, should be the exact solution of a perfectly rigid-plastic hollow sphere under uniform\nexternal pressure. The second, u?SG, should be an approximation of a velocity field that\nwould only cause a shape change to the RVE. Their expressions in terms of the macroscopic\nstrain rate E? and written in the spherical coordinate system depicted in Fig. 10 are\n\nu?VG = E?m\nR3\n\nr2\nand (3.46)\n\nu?SG = E?\n?, (3.47)\n\nwhere E?? = E? ? E?m1 is the macroscopic deviatoric strain rate and\n\nu?G = u?\nV\nG + u?\n\nS\nG. (3.48)\n\nThe compatibility equations from continuum mechanics allowed then to derive the\nacclaimed Gurson\u2019s trial velocity field by considering Eq. (3.48). Further details are given\nin Gurson (1975)\n\n??G(E?,r,?,?) = E?? + E?m\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)3\n[1 ? 3 (er(?,?) ? er(?,?))] (3.49)\n\nwhere er(?,?) r is the unitary vector on the radial direction.\n\n\n\n54 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions\n\nThe macroscopic plastic dissipation ? can be written as a function of the macro-\nscopic strain rate E? as\n\n?(E?) =\n1\nV\n\n?\nV\n?(??G(E?))dV =\n\n1\nV\n\n?\nV\n?0\n\n?\n2\n3\n??G : ??G\n\n=\n?0\nV\n\n?\nV\n\n?\nE?2eq ? 4E?m\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)3\nE?? : (er(?,?) ? er(?,?)) + 4E?2m\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)6\ndV.\n\n(3.50)\n\nwhere V = 43?R\n3 is RVE outer sphere volume and dV = r2 sin ?d?d?dr is the differential\n\nvolume element written in spherical coordinates, with r ? [rv,R], ? ? [0, 2?] and ? ? [0,?].\n\nThe viability of obtaining the analytical solution of Eq. (3.50) requires certain sim-\nplifications. Gurson (1975) assumed that the parcel ?4E?m\n\n(\nR\nr\n\n)3\nE?? : (er(?,?) ? er(?,?))\n\nin Eq. (3.50) could be eliminated without gravely affecting the overall accuracy of the\nmodel. The argument was that this elimination was in fact linked to the linearization of\nthe microscopic dissipation ?(??G) in terms of the variable\n\n\u00b5 =\neTr .E?.er\nE?eq\n\n.\n\nThus, he concluded that the high-order terms in the series expansion of ?(??G) could be\nneglected so that the resultant expression of ? in Eq. (3.50) could be simplified. This\nsimplified expression reads\n\n?G(E?) =\n?0\nV\n\n?\nV\n\n?\nE?2eq + 4E?2m\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)6\ndV\n\n=\n?0E?eq\nV\n\n?\nV\n\n?\n1 + 4H2\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)6\ndV\n\n=\n?0E?eq\nV\n\n?

It\ncan be observed that the macroscopic behavior of the deviatoric planes shown in Fig. 11a\nare circumferential, which is a direct influence of the microscopic von Mises yield criterion.\nMoreover, the meridional planes depicted in Fig. 11b are independent on the macroscopic\nstress Lode angle ?.\n\nIt is important to remark that, due to the linearization of ?(??G) performed by\nGurson (1975), the macroscopic stress Lode angle ? is restricted to the Lode angle ?\nassociated to the macroscopic strain rate tensor. This coincidence is clearly a limitation\nthat arises from that linearization. More recent works, as Benallal, Desmorat and Fournage\n(2014) and Benallal (2017), have overcome this limitation with semi-analytical developments\nand are described in section 3.4.\n\n3.3 Phenomenological extensions\n\nThe Gurson model has been the topic of several studies since the 1980s aiming to\nsurpass some of its limitations. A common approach for extending its capabilities is called\nphenomenological due to the nature of altering its original formulation. Basically, the pre-\ndictions obtained with the original model are confronted with cell model FEM calculations\nand experimental data. Then, some heuristic modification based on these comparisons is\n\n\n\n56 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions\n\n?0.5 0.0 0.5\n\n?0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n??3\n\n??1 ?\n?\n2\n\nGurson (1977)\nf = 1%\n\n?fm = 0.0 ?\nf\nm = 0.75 ?\n\nf\nm = 0.9 ?\n\nf\nm = 0.99\n\n(a) Deviatoric planes\n\n?4 ?3 ?2 ?1 0 1 2 3 4\n?m\n\n?1.0\n\n?0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n\u00b1\n?\n\neq\n\nGurson (1977)\nf = 1%\n\nfor any value of ?\n\n(b) Meridional plane\n\nFigure 11: Yield surface obtained with Gurson (1977) model for a porosity f = 1%.\n\n(a) deviatoric planes for different levels of ?fm = ?m/|?maxm | and (b) meridional plane for any\nmacroscopic stress Lode angle ?.

Source: (FERREIRA; PROEN\u00c7A; BENALLAL, 2019)\n\nproposed in order to better represent the reference behavior with a modification of the\noriginal model.\n\nA classical Gurson model modification is that presented by Tvergaard (1981) and\nTvergaard (1982). In these works, two parameters q1 and q2 were inserted into the original\nGurson yield function (Eq. (3.56)) so that it better agreed with numerical computations\nof cylindrical and spherical periodic cells of porous materials. These works found that\nq1 = 1.5 and q2 = 1.0 calibrated the modified yield function (Eq. (3.57)) with enough\naccuracy.\n\n(\n?Geq\n?0\n\n)2\n+ 2q1f cosh\n\n(\n3q2\n2\n?Gm\n?0\n\n)\n? [1 + (q1f)2)] = 0. (3.57)\n\nAnother important extension of the Gurson model was proposed by Tvergaard and\nNeedleman (1984). They argued that Gurson (1975) overestimated the porosity associated\nwith the loss of the material stress capacity (fc = 1/q1). Thus, they proposed that the\nporosity should be defined as\n\nf(f?) =\n\n????\n???\nf?, for f? ? fc\n\nfc ?\nfu ?fc\nfF ?fc\n\n(f? ?fc), for f? > fc,\n(3.58)\n\nwhere fc is the critical porosity related to the beginning of the coalescence process, fF is\nthe final fracture porosity associated to the end of the coalescence process, and fu = 1/q1\n\n\n\n3.3 Phenomenological extensions 57\n\nis the porosity for which the material loses the capacity of supporting any stress. Based\non the conclusions of the experimental investigations of Brown and Embury (1973 apud\nTVERGAARD; NEEDLEMAN, 1984) and Andersson (1977), Tvergaard and Needleman\n(1984) chose the values fc = 0.15 and fF = 0.25, respectively.\n\nThe effect of hardening in material matrices on the overall behavior of the Gurson-\nTvergaard-Needleman (GTN) model was assessed by Koplik and Needleman (1988). They\nanalyzed the spherical voids in periodic cells whose material matrix followed an exponential\nhardening law. According to their conclusions, q1 = 1.25 and q2 = 1.0 minimized the\ndiscrepancy of the GTN model with FEM calculations of periodic cells. Furthermore, a\nsmaller value of fc = 0.03 was required so that the accelerated void growth due to the\nmatrix hardening was accounted for.\n\nIn a review on ductile material failure, Tvergaard (1990) resumed several studies on\ncalibration of the parameters q1 and q2 by comparing the GTN model with both numerical\nand experimental references. He remarks that, in general, q1 ? [1.25, 2.0] and q2 ? 1.0\nreasonably agree with those references.\n\nTwenty years after the proposition of the GTN model, Bao and Wierzbicki (2004)\npointed out the inconsistency between the prediction and experimental results of the strain\nfailure for stress triaxialities less than T &lt;1/3 (see section 2.2 and Fig. 2). Based on this\nfact, a phenomenological extension of the Gurson model was developed by Nahshon and\nHutchinson (2008). They proposed a modification on the evolution law of porosity so that\nthe GTN model could better predict the strain failure caused by shear-dominated loadings.\nFor this purpose, the new evolution law was altered to be dependent on the macroscopic\nstress Lode angle ?:\n\nf? = (1 ?f) Tr E? + q?f?(?)\n?? : E?\n?eq\n\n, (3.59)\n\nwhere q? is a scalar parameter to adjust the influence of the shear loading on the porosity\nevolution law, ?? is the deviatoric part of the macroscopic stress tensor ?, and ?(?)\nis the macroscopic stress Lode angle given by Eq. (3.27). The parameter q? must be\ngraphically inferred in Nahshon and Hutchinson (2008) as a function of the initial porosity\nf0.\n\nThe prediction of strain failure by the Nahshon and Hutchinson (2008) for different\nvalues of q? and increasing macroscopic stress triaxialities is depicted in Fig. 12. Their\nmodel could capture the overall tendency of decreasing ductility for decreasing stress\ntriaxialities below T = 1/3 as in Bao and Wierzbicki (2004). However, there were no\nimprovements in the shape of the macroscopic yield surfaces and further works have been\ndeveloped since.\n\n\n\n58 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions\n\nFigure 12: The relation between fracture strain and stress triaxiality obtained by Nahshon and\nHutchinson (2008) aluminum alloy.\n\nRelations between the macroscopic failure equivalent strain ((?pe)c)min and the macroscopic\nstress triaxiality ?0m/?0e for two adjustment parameter k? = 1 and k? = 3 was obtained with a\nmodification on the porosity evolution law of the GTN model. The overall behavior as presented\nby Bao and Wierzbicki (2004) was captured. Note: k? = 1, ? and ?0m/?0e corresponds to q?, ?\nand T in the notation of this document. Moreover, the parameter L = ?1 is equivalent to ? = 0.\nSource: (NAHSHON; HUTCHINSON, 2008).\n\n3.4 Analytical and numerical extensions\n\nBasically, analytical and numerical extensions of the Gurson (1977) model relies on\nchoosing some trial velocity field and on simplifications of the model in such a way that\nanalytical developments become feasible. Among the more recent extensions, most have\nbeen concerned with the influence of the macroscopic Lode angle on the effective yield\ncriterion of porous materials. For example, Cazacu et al. (2014) chose the trial velocity field\nproposed by Rice and Tracey (1969) to obtain macroscopic yield surfaces of those materials\nunder axisymmetric loadings and concluded that these surfaces were dependent on the\nstress Lode angle. Trillat and Pastor (2005) also verified this dependence by performing\nnon-linear optimizations based on both conic programming and the kinematic and static\napproaches of the Limit Analysis. Finally, Cheng et al. (2015) used the statical theorem of\nlimit analysis to impose trial stress fields to 3D porous RVEs. They also obtained a yield\ncriterion explictly dependent on the stress Lode angle.\n\nAdditionally, the effect of the microscopic stress Lode angle has also been a matter\nof recent developments. In short, the insertion of the effect of this angle accounts for\nnon-quadratic yield criteria of material matrices (e.g. Tresca, Hershey-Hosford, William-\nWarnke). For instance, Trillat, Pastor and Thor\u00e9 (2006) performed a non-linear optimization\nalgorithm based on conic programming to obtain effective yield criterion of porous materials\nwhose matrix followed Drucker-Prager criterion. Another example is the work of Soare\n(2016), who extended the Gurson model to account for the Hershey-Hosford matrix criterion.\n\n\n\n3.4 Analytical and numerical extensions 59\n\nThey proceeded to approximate the expression of the microscopic plastic dissipation by a\ntruncated Fourier series. This approximation allowed them to numerically obtain effective\nyield surfaces.\n\nThe next two subsections review some details of the two recent works by Benallal,\nDesmorat and Fournage (2014) and Benallal (2017), which are crucial to understanding\nthe following chapters.\n\n3.4.1 An assessment on the effect of linearizing the microscopic plastic potential in the\nGurson model (BENALLAL; DESMORAT; FOURNAGE, 2014)\n\nThe effect of the linearization of the microscopic plastic dissipation ?(??G) on the\noverall microscopic yield criterion obtained by the Gurson model was assessed by Benallal,\nDesmorat and Fournage (2014). They proceeded to the minimization of the macroscopic\nplastic dissipation ?(E?) (Eq. (3.50)) without simplifying the expression of ?(??G). For this\npurpose, they obtained the expression of the macroscopic stress ? = ??/?E? by bearing\nthe full expression of\n\n?(E?) =\n?0\nV\n\n?\nV\n\n?\nE?2eq ? 4E?m\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)3\nE?? : (er(?,?) ? er(?,?)) + 4E?2m\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)6\ndV\n\n=\n?0E?eq\nV\n\n?\nV\n\n?\n1 ? 4H\u00b5\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)3\n+ 4H2\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)6\ndV,\n\n(3.60)\n\nwhere \u00b5(?,?) = E?? : (er(?,?) ? er(?,?)).\n\nSince E? can be equivalently written in terms of its three invariants (E?m or H, E?eq\nand ? or cos 3?), the derivative ? = ??/?E? is decomposed into three chain rule parcels\n\n? =\n??\n\n?E?\n=\n\n??\n\n?E?m\n\n?E?m\n\n?E?\n+\n\n??\n\n?E?eq\n\n?E?eq\n\n?E?\n+\n\n??\n\n? cos 3?\n? cos 3?\n?E?\n\n=\n1\n3\n??\n\n?E?m\n1 +\n\n2\n3\n??\n\n?E?eq\n\nE??\n\nE?eq\n?\n\n4\n3 sin ?\n\n(\n1\nE?eq\n\n??\n\n??\n\n)[(\nE?? \u00b7 E??\n\nE?2eq\n?\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n)\n?\n\n1\n2\n\ncos 3?\nE??\n\nE?eq\n\n] (3.61)\n\nThis assumption is consistent to isotropic materials due to the guarantee of coincidence of\nthe principal directions of ? and E?. However, in anisotropic analyses, another approach\nshould be applied (more details in chapter 4).\n\nThe complexity of Eq. (3.61) prevents that the resultant yield criterion to be\nwritten in a closed-form expression as in Gurson (1977). Nevertheless, Eq. (3.61) can be\naccurately solved by using common numerical integration procedures. Thus, Fig. 13 depicts\nthree meridional planes of a macroscopic yield surface related to a material whose porosity\nand yield stress are respectively assumed f = 1% and ?0 = 1. These meridional planes\n\n\n\n60 Chapter 3 Isotropic ductile fracture modeling: The Gurson model and its extensions\n\ncorrespond to six different levels of the macroscopic stress Lode angle: ? = 0, ? = ?/6 and\n? = ?/3 for the upper quadrants (?eq ? 0); and ? = ?, ? = ?/6 + ? and ? = ?/3 + ? for\nthe lower quadrants (i.e. ?eq &lt;0). As Gurson (1975) had remarked, the linearization of\n?(??G) does not strongly affect the overall model\u2019s behavior. However, further improvements\non the Gurson model relies on the possibility of accounting for the influence of the stress\nLode angle on shear-dominated loads, which can only be considered, in the context of the\nGurson model, by using the non-linearized plastic dissipation potential, as in Benallal,\nDesmorat and Fournage (2014).\n\n?2.7 ?2.6 ?2.5 ?2.4 ?2.3 ?2.2 ?2.1\n?m\n\n0.66\n\n0.68\n\n0.70\n\n0.72\n\n0.74\n\n0.76\n\n0.78\n\n0.80\n\n\u00b1\n?\ne\nq\n\nIsotropic\nf = 1%\nm = 2\n\nI\n\n0\n?\n6\n\n?\n3\n\n(a) Zoom on the upper left quadrant\n\n2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8\n?m\n\n0.50\n\n0.55\n\n0.60\n\n0.65\n\n0.70\n\n0.75\n\n\u00b1\n?\ne\nq\n\nIsotropic\nf = 1%\nm = 2\n\nI\n\n0\n?\n6\n\n?\n3\n\n(b) Zoom on the upper right quadrant\n\n?4 ?3 ?2 ?1 0 1 2 3 4\n?m\n\n?1.0\n\n?0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n\u00b1\n?\ne\nq\n\nIsotropic\nf = 1%\nm = 2\n\nI\n\n0\n?\n6\n\n?\n3\n\n(c) Meridional planes\n\nFigure 13: Meridional planes of a yield surface for porosity f = 1% obtained with the Benallal,\nDesmorat and Fournage (2014) model.\n\nA slight distinctness between meridional planes associated to different macroscopic stress Lode\nangles ? can be noticed.

This parameter\nwas inserted into the microscopic yield criterion ?(?) by defining an auxiliary function\ng(?) that multiplies the equivalent measure of stress ?eq:\n\n?(?) = ?eqg(?) ??0 ? 0 (3.62)\n\nwhere, in order to guarantee the convexity of the yield surface given by ?(?), the function\ng(?) must satisfy g??(?) + g(?) ? 0.\n\nIn a practical view, the function g(?) generalizes the shape of the microscopic\nyield surface. Thus, a desired behavior of the yield criterion may be obtained by defining\na specific function g(?). Accordingly, Benallal (2017) proposed a particularization of\ng(?) so that it represents the Hershey-Hosford yield criterion ((HERSHEY, 1954 apud\nNEMAT-NASSER; HORI, 1993) and (HOSFORD, 1972))\n\n?HH =\n{1\n\n2\n[(?1 ??2)\n\nm + (?2 ??3)\nm + (?3 ??1)\n\nm]\n}1/m\n\n.

One of them is the restriction about void\nmorphology, mainly in the isotropic case of a spherical RVE. In this case, the spherical\nvoid is assumed to conserve its morphology throughout the entire deformation process. In\nother words, the damage evolution is described only in terms of porosity, which means\nthat an eventual shape change is not accounted for.\n\nImportant contributions to this field have been accomplished by Gologanu, Leblond\nand Devaux (1993), Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1994) and Gologanu et al. (1997).\nThey approached the case of spheroidal cavities contained in a confocal spheroidal matrix\nand derived its macroscopic yield criterion by assuming special velocity fields which satisfy\nhomogeneous boundary conditions on the outer surface. These fields were idealized by\nmaking an interesting analogy between the velocity in a point with the electric field on\nthe same point lead by an electric charge located in the RVE center. After an extensive\nmathematical development detailed in their works and important approximations of integral\nterms by their respective averages in the RVE domain, they proposed a Gurson-like yield\ncriterion expression dependent on both porosity and a shape factor so that the spheroidal\nvoid could be defined. Because of its rigorous mathematical aspects, this model is limited\nto spheroidal voids (both elongated and flatted ones) aligned to the principal directions of\naxisymmetric macroscopic strain rate field. Gologanu et al. (2001) and Gologanu, Leblond\nand Devaux (2001) also proposed models for predicting coalescence of initially spherical\nvoids inside cylindrical RVEs under axisymmetric deformation. These voids then might\nevolve and assume an spheroidal shape.\n\nAnother group of significant advances to the consideration of void morphology on\nductile rupture of porous materials were developed by Ponte Casta\u00f1eda and Zaidman\n(1994), Ponte Casta\u00f1eda and Zaidman (1996), Zaidman and Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (1996),\nKailasam, Aravas and Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (2000), Aravas and Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (2004), Danas\nand Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (2009a) and Danas and Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (2009b). Basically, these\nworks rely on the estimation of effective properties of nonlinear composite materials (which\nin these cases are porous ones) proposed by Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (1991) and Ponte Casta\u00f1eda\n(1992), which uses an approach based on variational principles to obtain these properties by\na specific comparison with a correlated linear composite, and also Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (2002a)\nand Ponte Casta\u00f1eda (2002b), which is based on a second-order variational formulation.\nThe choice of the strain rate field relies on the Eshelby (1957) approach to a problem of an\n\n\n\n68 Chapter 4 Effect of porous morphology on ductile failure\n\ninclusion contained in an infinite elastic medium. In order to simulate in an elastic medium\nthe incompressibility condition of ductile plasticity, they impose the Poisson parameter to\nhold ? = 1/2. Although these models comprehend arbitrarily oriented ellipsoidal voids and\nconsider finite strain formulation, the fact that Elsheby\u2019s microscopic strain rate field is\nderived to an infinite elastic media might limit their representativity of plastic materials.\n\nAnother important improvement on the Gurson model to account for the growth and\ncoalescence of spheroidal cavities is provided by Pardoen and Hutchinson (2000). Basically,\nthey heuristically extended the approaches of Gologanu et al. (1997) for considering\nvoid shapes and Thomason (1993) for taking the onset of coalescence into account. The\nimportant feature of their model is that no phenomenological variables \u2013 which are difficult\nto determine experimentally \u2013 are therein considered. In addition, only one heuristic\nparameter q is required, which does not need to be obtained at each analysis, but can be\nobtained once and for all by FEM cell calculations. They also compared their heuristic\ncriterion with several 3D FEM calculations and confirmed the good agreement between\nthese models.\n\nMonchiet et al. (2006) and Monchiet et al. (2008) extended the models of Gologanu,\nLeblond and Devaux (1993) and Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1994), by following\nsimilar approximations and assumptions as those works, in order to the material matrix to\nfollow the anisotropic yield criterion proposed by Hill (1948). Next, Monchiet, Charkaluk\nand Kondo (2007) and Monchiet, Charkaluk and Kondo (2011) took the Eshelby (1957)\ndisplacement field for the problem of an inclusion surrounded by an infinite continuum\nmedium as a trial velocity field to the problem of a hollow spheroidal RVE with perfectly\nrigid-plastic material matrix. Since this field is not the exact one to the referred RVE\nproblem, this approach also constitutes an upper bound. This model was implemented into\na FEM code by Lin et al. (2010) so that notched and round tensile bars could be modeled\nin detail. Their results showed the improvement provided by this new trial velocity field.\n\nThe class of velocity fields as that used in Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1993)\nand Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1994) was generalized by Leblond and Gologanu\n(2008). They found a class of velocity field, related to the problem of a spheroidal RVE with\na confocal spheroidal void, which respects the assumption of uniform (i.e. constant) strain\nrate conditions along every confocal spheroid in the RVE domain. Madou and Leblond\n(2012a) and Madou and Leblond (2012b) used this velocity field to obtain effective yield\ncriterion of ductile materials with spheroidal voids by asymptotically expanding the\nexpressions of the macroscopic plastic dissipation potential and of the effective stress\ntensors.\n\nFlandi and Leblond (2005a) and Flandi and Leblond (2005b) proposed a heuristic\nexpression of the macroscopic gauge function (which is an analogous concept defined by\nLeblond, Perrin and Suquet (1994) of yield functions, albeit used in a viscoplastic materials\n\n\n\n4.2 A Gurson-like RVE with arbitrary centered void morphology 69\n\ncontext) of porous materials containing spheroidal voids. This expression was imposed\nto reproduce reference models when particularized to certain cases, as for the perfectly\nrigid-plastic case of Gologanu, Leblond and Devaux (1993) and Gologanu, Leblond and\nDevaux (1994). The restriction to spheroidal voids and the heuristic character of the gauge\nfunction expression are the drawbacks of this approach, in spite of reasonable agreement\nnumerical unit cell FEM calculations.\n\nIn order to provide a contribution to the study of ductile plasticity, this chapter\npresents a Gurson-based approach to obtain an overall yield criterion of anisotropic porous\nmaterials. A spherical RVE containing a centered ellipsoidal void is assumed to represent\northotropic porous media under a rupture process. The material matrix surrounding the\nvoid is dependent on the third invariant of microscopic stresses, as in Benallal (2017).\nThe Gurson\u2019s trial velocity field is chosen to approximate the solution of that RVE by an\nupper bound. Although only the void morphology is altered in relation to Benallal\u2019s work,\nthe analytical approach as well as some fundamental definitions have to be generalized\nso that the anisotropic effect induced is the void morphology be adequately considered.\nThe results hereby presented show the consistency of the present formulation and provide\nimportant insights for further investigation.\n\n4.2 A Gurson-like RVE with arbitrary centered void morphology\n\nAiming to propose an advance on the work by Benallal (2017), let us initially\nconsider a spherical RVE whose material matrix and boundary conditions follow the\nconfiguration introduced in his work. However, let the centered cavity assume now an\nellipsoidal morphology instead of a spherical one. Figure 17 schematizes an arbitrary\nspherical RVE with an isotropic material matrix defined in ? and uniform macroscopic\nstrain rate E? applied to the external contour ??+. The inner contour ???, i.e. the void\nsurface, is assumed to be traction-free. A mathematical description of the sets ?, ??+,\n??? and ? is presented in Eq.

This\nconfiguration is in accordance with the results that will be shown in section 4.4. However,\nas justified in chapter 7, this restriction is only necessary for visualizing the yield surfaces\nin the principal macroscopic stress space and it is not a limitation of the formulation itself.\n\nAn RVE with an ellipsoidal cavity, as illustrated in Fig. 17, can be conveniently\ndescribed in terms of relative lengths (`1,`2,`3), the porosity f and the external radius R\nof the RVE. The advantage of using relative lengths (`1,`2,`3) is that they might represent\nonly the ratios between the principal radii of the ellipsoid. Thus, this notation briefly\ndescribes how much elongated or flatted an ellipsoid is in each direction (x1,x2,x3). The\nprincipal radii (r1,r2,r3) of the ellipsoid are obtained in terms of (`1,`2,`3), f and R as\n\nri = `i 3\n?\n\nf\n\n`1`2`3\nR i = 1, 2, 3. (4.2)\n\n\n\n4.3 Deriving the macroscopic yield surface 71\n\nFor example, an RVE with (`1,`2,`3) = (1, 4, 8), f = 1% and R = 1 (unitary)\npresents an ellipsoidal cavity whose principal radii give r1 ? 0.067860, r2 ? 0.271442 and\nr3 ? 0.542884, which satisfies r2/r1 = `2/`1 = 4 and r3/r1 = `3/`1 = 8.\n\nThe classical definitions of spheroids (i.e. an ellipsoid whose two of the principal\nradii have the same length) are also useful for describing the void morphology. A spheroid\nis said to be prolate (oblate) if one principal radius is greater (less) than the other two.\nFor instance, in terms of relative lengths (`1,`2,`3), a (8, 1, 1) is prolate spheroid and a\n(1, 8, 8) is an oblate one.\n\nFinally, each of the principal radii of the ellipsoidal void must be less than the\nexternal radius R so that the cavity is thoroughly contained in the RVE. This condition\nin terms of the relative lengths (`1,`2,`3) satisfies\n\nli\n3\n\n?\nf\n\n`1`2`3\n&lt;1 i = 1, 2, 3. (4.3)\n\n4.3 Deriving the macroscopic yield surface\n\nSince the material matrix defined in the domain ? of the RVE follows the Hershey-\nHosford criterion (Eq.

Since some anisotropic effect is expected to\nbe acquired from the potential ?(E?) due to the void morphology, the principal directions\nof E? also play a role in Eq. (4.11), as illustrated in Fig. 18 and 19. Thus, it is useful to\ntreat the macroscopic strain rate tensor E? intrinsically (i.e. as a whole tensor) in the\ndevelopment of Eq.

Further developments with more\nrefined trial velocity fields are previewed in the next steps of the research.

Furthermore, this chosen value of porosity has also shown to\nadequately highlight the differences between properties of each morphology considered\nhere. The other parameters that are assumed are (i) the Hershey-Hosford shape parameter\nm = 8, which refers to a FCC material matrix; (ii) the microscopic yield stress ?0 = 1\n(unitary) for the sake of simplicity; and (iii) the external radius R = 1 (unitary) of the\nRVE.\n\nTable 1: Spherical voids of RVEs with porosity\nf = 5% and external radius R = 1 (unitary).\n\n(`1,`2,`3) r1 r2 r3\n\n(1,1,1) 0.368403 0.368403 0.368403\n\nSource: the author.\n\nTable 2: Prolate spheroidal voids of RVEs with\nporosity f = 5% and external radius R = 1\n(unitary).\n\n(`1,`2,`3) r1 r2 r3\n\n(2,1,1) 0.584804 0.292402 0.292402\n(3,1,1) 0.766309 0.255436 0.255436\n(4,1,1) 0.928318 0.232079 0.232079\n(1,4,1) 0.232079 0.928318 0.232079\n(1,1,4) 0.232079 0.232079 0.928318\n\nSource: the author.\n\nTable 3: Oblate spheroidal voids of RVEs with\nporosity f = 5% and external radius R = 1\n(unitary).\n\n(`1,`2,`3) r1 r2 r3\n\n(1,4,4) 0.146201 0.584804 0.584804\n(1,8,8) 0.092101 0.736806 0.736806\n(8,1,8) 0.736806 0.092101 0.736806\n(8,8,1) 0.736806 0.736806 0.092101\n\nSource: the author.\n\nThe first set of analyses consists of macroscopic yield surfaces obtained from\nspherical RVEs (as in Fig. 17) with three different void morphologies in it.

The second one is related to flattened voids, which are represented by an (1,8,8)\noblate spheroid in Fig. 21. Finally, with the aim of representing the class of arbitrary\nellipsoidal voids in Fig. 22, an (1,4,8) ellipsoid is chosen.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 20a-22a, the deviatoric planes ?fm = 0 coincide with the respective\nisotropic reference. This fact indicates that the present approach is not able to capture\nany anisotropic effect for ?fm = 0, regardless the morphology considered. This limitation\narises from the choice of Gurson\u2019s microscopic strain rate field ?? (Eq. (4.17)), since\nE?m ? 0 =? ??(E?,r,?,?) = ??(E?) = E??. This means that, for any traceless macroscopic\nstrain rate E? = E??, the microscopic one ?? is uniform in ?. Hence, the choice of ?? prevents\nEq. (4.11) of obtaining any influence of the void morphology.\n\nThe macroscopic yield surfaces in Fig. 20 and 21 suggest that spherical RVEs with\nspheroidal voids mechanically behave as transversely isotropic materials. In a similar way,\nFig. 22 indicates the presence of orthotropic symmetries in the macroscopic yield surface\nresultant of spherical RVEs with ellipsoidal voids. These observations are in agreement\nwith geometrical configurations of the RVEs presented in Fig. 17 and put forward the\nconsistency of the present formulation.\n\nAlthough the meridional planes in Fig. 20b-22b do not exhibit any significant\ndiscrepancy between different levels of ?, a slight vertical asymmetry might be noticed.\nAlbeit discreet, this effect illustrates the influence of the anisotropy induced by the void\nmorphology also on the meridional planes of the macroscopic yield surfaces.\n\n\n\n78 Chapter 4 Effect of porous morphology on ductile failure\n\n?1 0 1\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n??3\n\n??1 ?\n?\n2\n\nPROLATE\nf = 5%\nm = 8\n\n...

Source: the author.\n\nThe effects of different elongation aspects and orientations on prolate spheroidal,\noblate spheroidal and ellipsoidal voids are explored in Fig. 23-25, respectively. In each of\nthese figures, two types of comparisons on the deviatoric plane ?fm = ?m/|?m|max = 0.99\nare proposed. The first one investigates the effect of different relative lengths for the same\ntype of void morphology and porosity. The second one considers three similar voids, whose\neach respective triple of relative lengths is a cyclic permutation of three fixed values. These\npermutations simulate the effect of rotating the void so that their resultant orientations\nare orthogonal to each other.\n\nThe elongation of voids in certain directions induced a gain of resistance on those\nrespective directions, in accordance with Fig. 23a-25a. Since ?fm = 0.99 > 0, it is expected\nthat this gain of resistance would be noticed predominantly on the positive range of the\naxes on the deviatoric plane (i.e. ??i). This fact is also confirmed in Fig. 23a-25a, which\nsustain the consistency of the present formulation.\n\nFig. 23b-25b show that curves related to void orientations that have a relative length\nin common for a certain direction coincide on its correspondent axis. This observation\nalso illustrates the transversely isotropic and orthotropic behaviors that are induced by\nspheroidal and ellipsoidal voids, respectively. Moreover, the match of the curves precisely\non the expected axis shows the accuracy and consistency of the present implementation.\n\n\n\n80 Chapter 4 Effect of porous morphology on ductile failure\n\n?0.2 ?0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2\n?0.2\n\n?0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2 ?\n?\n3\n\n??1 ?\n?\n2\n\nPROLATE\nf = 5%\nm = 8\n\n?fm = 0.99\n\n(2,1,1) (3,1,1) (4,1,1) (1,1,1)\n\n(a) Elongation comparison\n\n?0.2 0.0 0.2\n\n?0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n??3\n\n??1 ?\n?\n2\n\nPROLATE\nf = 5%\nm = 8\n\n?fm = 0.99\n\n(1,1,4) (1,4,1) (4,1,1) (1,1,1)\n\n(b) Orientation comparison\n\nFigure 23: Comparisons between deviatoric planes of macroscopic yield surfaces obtained from\nspherical RVEs with different prolate spheroidal voids.\n\nContour plots of ?fm = ?m/|?m|max = 0.99.

The choice of Gurson\u2019s trial velocity field and spherical\nRVE facilitated the analytical developments and possibly its further implementation\nin multiscale FEM codes. However, this choice limited the anisotropic effects to high\ntriaxialities, which encourages the search for more representative approximations to the\ntrial velocity field and for alternative approaches of modeling anisotropy in ductile failure.\n\nAlthough it was not possible to derive a closed-form expression for the yield\ncriterion, the development of high-performance scientific computing makes multiscale FEM\ncodes feasible nowadays. Thus, a yield criterion written in an integral form can still be\nsuccessfully implemented in FEM codes with the advantage of not penalizing the analytical\ndevelopment with further simplifications.\n\nThe results obtained in the form of macroscopic yield surfaces have shown to be\nconsistent. Moreover, the identification of transversely isotropic and orthotropy symmetries\nin the results related to spheroidal and ellipsoidal voids, respectively, unveiled the accuracy\nof the present implementation. However, further work is required to validate the formulation\nhereby presented with experimental studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n83\n\n5 EFFECTIVE YIELD CRITERIA FOR POROUS ANISOTROPIC MEDIA\n\nThis chapter proposes an anisotropic yield criterion for porous ductile materials. The\napproach consists of representing the morphological microstructure properties by defining\na spherical RVE containing a centered spherical void. The material matrix surrounding\nthis void is assumed to be continuous and follows an anisotropic yield criterion proposed\nby Karafillis and Boyce (1993). A uniform macroscopic strain rate E? at the external\nsurface of the RVE and a traction-free prescription are imposed as boundary conditions\nto the RVE problem. The classical Gurson\u2019s trial velocity field is chosen to compose\nthe microscopic strain rate as a first attempt, which approximates the solution to the\nRVE mechanical problem and performs a rigorous upper bound solution to it. The effect\nof different morphologies of the void is not considered in the following analysis so that\nany perceptible effect of anisotropy is due exclusively to the matrix behavior. Numerical\nsimulations are hereby presented for four different symmetries of porous ductile materials:\nCubic, Transversely Isotropic, Tetragonal and Orthotropic. These results highlight the\nconsistency of the present approach representing the yield criterion of ductile porous\nmaterials whose microstructures present specific crystal symmetries.\n\n5.1 The concept of an Isotropic Plastic Equivalent material\n\nClassical yield criteria for anisotropic continuum media have been proposed since\nHill (1948), who altered the equivalent stresses of criteria for isotropic criteria (e.g. the\nvon Mises stress) were modified in a certain mathematical way to insert new material\ncoefficients to be experimentally determined. Although this class of yield criteria has\nbeen largely used so far in the literature, these approaches usually lack the physical\nmeaning of each coefficient. Besides, the formulations related to these criteria end up being\nconsiderably more complex than the classical isotropic ones, as well as being particularized\nfor specific crystal symmetries.\n\nKarafillis and Boyce (1993) proposed a more convenient treatment for formulating\nyield criteria for anisotropic continuum media, which is based on the concept of an Isotropic\nPlastic Equivalent (IPE) material. This fictitious IPE material is assumed to undergo\nauxiliary stress states s?, which are defined by applying a linear transformation L on the\ntrue Cauchy stress tensor ?, Eq. (5.1). Since stress states are mathematically represented\nby second-order tensors, the linear transformation L is defined as a fourth-order one.\n\ns? = L : ? (5.1)\n\n\n\n84 Chapter 5 Macroscopic yield criteria for porous anisotropic ductile media\n\nThe usefulness of the definition of the auxiliary stress tensors relies on the property\nthat an affine transformation preserves convexity (EGGLESTON, 1958). Following this\nproperty of convex functions, Karafillis and Boyce (1993) realized that the convexity of an\nisotropic yield criterion is preserved if its argument, which is a Cauchy true stress tensor ?,\nis linearly transformed by the operator L, as in Eq. (5.1). Therefore, since the symmetries\nof the operator L might imply a rotation of the principal directions of ?, an anisotropic\nyield criterion ? on the variable ? can be defined by an equivalent isotropic one, ?, on\nthe auxiliary stress tensor s?, as shown in Eq. (5.2). In other words, an anisotropic yield\ncriterion can be equivalently obtained by using an already known isotropic one, which is\nthen related to an IPE material.\n\n?(?) = ?(s?) = ?(L : ?) (5.2)\n\nThe linear operator L definition requires three general conditions. The first one\narises from guaranteeing the symmetry of both ? and s?, which implies in the so-called\nminor symmetry of fourth-order tensors: Lijkl = Ljikl = Ljilk. The second condition\nminimizes the number of needed anisotropy coefficients to represent an arbitrary crystal\nsymmetry and implies the so-called big symmetry of fourth-order tensors: Lijkl = Lklij.\nFinally, the last condition is a consequence of the necessity that s? is traceless regardless\nof the anisotropy parameters, so that the linear transformation operated by L over ? be\ndefined in the deviatoric space: Lijkk = 0, where implicit sum applies.\n\nThe symmetries hereupon cited allow to represent Eq. (5.1) in Voigt notation (see\nAppendix A) by considering a system of six equations, as shown in Eq. (5.3). The stress\ntensors ? and s?, as well as the linear operator L? are depicted as (6 \u00d7 1) vectors and a\n(6 \u00d7 6) matrix, respectively. Due to major symmetry of L, L is a symmetric matrix.\n\n??????????????\n?????????????\n\ns?11\n\ns?22\n\ns?33?\n2s?23?\n2s?31?\n2s?12\n\n??????????????\n?????????????\n\n=\n\n?\n?????????????\n\nL1111 L1122 L1133\n?\n\n2L1123\n?\n\n2L1131\n?\n\n2L1112\nL1122 L2222 L2233\n\n?\n2L2223\n\n?\n2L2231\n\n?\n2L2212\n\nL1133 L2233 L3333\n?\n\n2L3323\n?\n\n2L3331\n?\n\n2L3312?\n2L1123\n\n?\n2L2223\n\n?\n2L3323 2L2323 2L2331 2L2312?\n\n2L1131\n?\n\n2L2231\n?\n\n2L3331 2L2331 2L3131 2L3112?\n2L1112\n\n?\n2L2212\n\n?\n2L3312 2L2312 2L3112 2L1212\n\n?\n?????????????\n\n??????????????\n?????????????\n\n?11\n\n?22\n\n?33?\n2?23?\n2?31?\n2?12\n\n??????????????\n?????????????\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe matrix L in Eq.

This effect,\nhowever, plays an important role on ductile rupture phenomena according to several\nexperimental studies ((ARGON; IM; SAFOGLU, 1975), (ARGON; IM, 1975), (ARGON,\n1976), (ROZOVSKY; HAHN; AVITZUR, 1973), (BEREMIN, 1981)).\n\nIn order to overcome this drawback, the present work proposes an approach for\nconsidering the effect of porosity on ductile rupture modeling. For this purpose, a spherical\nRVE containing a centered and also spherical void is assumed to represent the porosity\ncontained in the microstructure of an arbitrary ductile material. The material matrix\nsurrounding the spherical void is then assumed to follow the yield criterion of Eq. (5.6).\nSince only centered spherical voids are hereby considered, any noticeable anisotropic\nbehavior is certainly due to the yield criterion of the material matrix. An illustration of\nthe RVE conception is put forward in Fig. 26.\n\n\n\n86 Chapter 5 Macroscopic yield criteria for porous anisotropic ductile media\n\n2R\nrv\n\n?

(5.7), which corresponds to (a) the\nyield criterion, (b) the associated flow rule, (c) the consistency condition and (d) the\nirreversibility condition.\n\n?(s?) ??0 ? 0 (5.7a)\n\n??? = ??\n??\n\n?s?\n(5.7b)\n\n???(s?) = 0 (5.7c)\n?? ? 0 (5.7d)\n\nThe attachment between the RVE and its microscopic vicinities is approximated\nby the prescription of a uniform macroscopic strain rate E?, described in Eq. (3.28), in\n??+ (see Fig. 26). Furthermore, the inner surface (???) of the RVE is assumed to be\ntraction-free. Eq. (5.8) summarizes these last boundary conditions below:\n\nu? = E?x ?x on ??+, (5.8a)\n?n(x) = 0 ?x on ???, (5.8b)\n\nwhere n(x) is the normal vector to the inner surface ??? and ? is the resultant macro-\nscopic stress tensor.\n\nAs will be discussed later on, the solution of the problem defined by the RVE\nthat undergoes the hereupon conditions is approximated in the sense of Gurson (1977).\n\n\n\n5.2 A Gurson-like RVE for modeling porous anisotropic media 87\n\nAccording to this work, a convenient upper bound approach consists of taking a trial\nvelocity field u?G(x), for x ? ?, as the solution to the RVE problem. This trial velocity field\nis kinematically admissible (i.e., it matches external boundary conditions: u?G(x) = E?x,\nfor x ? ??+) and finally gives rise to the classical Gurson\u2019s trial strain rate field ??G, as in\nEq. (5.9).\n\n??G(E?,r,?,?) = E?? + E?m\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)3\n(1 ? 3er(?,?) ?er(?,?)) (5.9)\n\nwhere r, ? and ? are respectively the radius, the polar angle and the azimuthal angle\nassociated to the spherical coordinate system, as illustrated in Fig. 10.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the choice of the trial velocity field of Gurson\n(1977) consists of a first attempt to obtain an upper bound approximation to the effective\ncriterion. More refined trial velocity fields are required in the next steps of research. For\ninstance, the field proposed by Monchiet and Kondo (2012), which is the exact solution of\na spherical porous RVE whose material matrix obeys the Hill-Schleicher yield criterion\ncan be particularized to a RVE whose matrix follows an incompressible plastic flow rule.\nAdditionally, the exact solution of an elastic spherical RVE with a centered and also\nspherical inclusion given by Li, Sauer and Wang (2007) may be particularized to the\ncondition of Poisson\u2019s coefficient ? = 1/2 \u2013 to represent the incompressibility condition\n\u2013 and to the case where the inclusion offers no stiffness to the RVE \u2013 to consider a void\ninstead of an inclusion.\n\nIn the sense of Karafillis and Boyce (1993), a trial strain rate field associated to the\nconcept of an IPE material can be deduced by combining both normality rules concerning\nthe actual strain rate ?? = ????/?? and ??? = ??/?s? with Eq. (5.1), as in Eq. (5.10).\n\n??? = ??\n??\n\n?s?\n= ??\n\n??\n\n??\n:\n??\n\n?s?\n= ?? : L+ (5.10)\n\nwhere L+ represents the inverse of the fourth-order tensor L with respect to the deviatoric\nspace.\n\nThus, the trial velocity field ???(E??,r,??) concerning the IPE material in the RVE\ndomain ? is then defined as\n\n???(E?,r,??) = ?? : L+ = E?? : L+ + E?m\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)3\n(1 ? 3er(?,?) ?er(?,?)) : L+ (5.11)\n\nIn an equivalent manner, a macroscopic IPE material is conveniently idealized. For\nthis purpose, a macroscopic IPE strain rate field is defined as\n\nE?? = E?? : L+ + E?m1.

It can be defined as a function\nof the incompressible (i.e. Tr ?? = 0) microscopic strain rate field ?? as\n\n?(??) = sup\n???\n{? : ??} (5.17)\n\nwhere ? = {?|?(?) = ?(s?) ? ?0} is a convex set of stress tensors ?.\n\nConsidering the normality rule for the flow of the microscopic plastic strain rate\n?? = ????/?? and the fact that the yield function ?(?) is a homogeneous function of\ndegree one, Eq.

Because Lijkk = 0 (pressure\nindependence condition), its inverse L+ satisfies L : L+ = J, where J is the deviatoric\nfourth-order identity defined in Eq.

Each of these symmetries\nis related to specific dependency between coefficients in the tensor L, represented in Voigt\nnotation in Eq. (5.4). These restrictions are schematized in Fig. 27 and were adapted from\nRoyer and Dieulesaint (2000a), Royer and Dieulesaint (2000b), Canova et al. (1985) and\nCowin (2013) in order to respect Eq. (5.5) as well. The chosen coefficients of L for each of\nthose symmetries (C, TI, T and O), additionally to the isotropic one (I), are summarized in\nTable 5. These coefficients were picked only for academic purposes. Additionally, Karafillis\nand Boyce (1993) proposed a experimental procedure to identify these coefficients only for\na given continuum material. Thus, further work must be devoted in order to propose an\nexperimental method to determine the coefficients of L for a porous ductile material.\n\n\n\n94 Chapter 5 Macroscopic yield criteria for porous anisotropic ductile media\n\n11 22 33 23 3112\n\n22\n11\n\n23\n33\n\n12\n31\n\nOrthotropic Tetragonal Transversely \nIsotropic\n\nIsotropicCubic\n\nPrescribed component\n\nDependent component\nZero component\n\nLinks equal components\n\n(L1111 - L1122)/2\n\n6 4 3\n\n2\n\nFigure 27: Anisotropy symmetries represented in the linear transformation L used in this section.\n\nThe five anisotropy symmetries used in this section are illustrated here (including isotropy) by\ngeneral schemes of L on its irreducible forms.

Thus, a porosity f = 1% and a Hershey-Hosford shape parameter m = 8\nare chosen to simulate this condition for an FCC material matrix. For sake of simplicity,\nthe microscopic yield stress ?0 = 1, which does not affect any of the further overall results\nnor conceptual discussions.\n\n\n\n5.5 Results and discussion 95\n\nThe coefficient C in Eq. (5.4) is chosen so that it satisfies ||\n(\nL+\n\n)\n|| = ||J|| for every\n\nconsidered symmetry. This assumption assures that none of the discrepancy between the\nisotropic reference (I) and the anisotropic yield surfaces is due to any uniform scale factor.\nHence, only the relation between the Lkk coefficients, k = 1, .., 6, affects the anisotropic\ncurves throughout this section.\n\nFigures 28\u201331 present both (a) deviatoric and (b) meridional planes of macroscopic\nyield surfaces for the cubic (C1), transversely isotropic (TI3), tetragonal (T1) and or-\nthotropic (O1) symmetries, respectively. The overall macroscopic behavior matches the\nmicroscopic symmetries prescribed for material matrices. For example, while the deviatoric\nplanes shown in Fig. 28a for a cubic material matrix (C1) do not present any relative\nrotation when compared to the isotropic reference (I), Fig. 29a exhibits a significant one.\nThis rotation effect is due to the difference between the coefficients L11, L22 and L33, which\nprivileges the directions 11 and 22 with more rigidity (i.e. for a specific direction, the\nrigidity and the Lkk coefficients are inversely proportional to each other).\n\nThe influence of decreasing symmetry planes (i.e. the increasing anisotropy effect)\ncan be noticed by the increasing discrepancy between meridional planes in Figures 28b,\n29b, 30b and 31b. For instance, the effect of different coefficients in the linear operator\nL in Eq. (5.4) for the orthotropic material matrix (O1) induced the macroscopic yield\nsurface to distinguish its meridional planes for different macroscopic stress Lode angles ?.\nIn the context of the present work, this outcome can be seen as a secondary indicator of\nthe number of symmetry planes for a certain anisotropic matrix.\n\nThe analytical predictions described for E?m ? ? in Eq. (5.45) and (5.46) are\ncompared to the numerical results in Figures 28a, 29a, 30a and 31a. They exactly match\nthe deviatoric planes related to a level of ?fm = 0, which indicates the consistency between\nthe analytical formulation and the computational implementation.\n\nIn order to evaluate the influence of different intensities of coefficients for the\nsame material symmetry, Fig. 32 shows the deviatoric planes for the almost hydrostatic\nlevel ?fm = 0.99 related to two macroscopic yield symmetries obtained for two different\ncubic material matrices (C1 and C2). These results confirm the consistency of the present\nformulation by providing the same of number symmetry pattern in each curve. In addition,\nthe more different coefficients of the linear operator L are from the isotropic coefficients,\nthe more further away the anisotropic curves (C1 and C2) are from the isotropic reference.\n\nAnalogously, Fig. 33 exhibits macroscopic deviatoric planes for the level ?fm = 0.99\nrelated to three transversely isotropic material matrices (TI1, TI2, TI3). Because of the\npermutation of their anisotropy coefficients (see Table 5), TI1, TI2 and TI3 represent\nanisotropy frames that are orthogonal to each other. This orthogonality is corroborated by\nthe matching of the curves TI1, TI2 and TI3 in specific points on the deviatoric plane.

The results were limited to cases which there was coincidence between\nthe principal directions of macroscopic strain rate and the anisotropic referential due to the\nextreme computational cost of performing 6-dimensional contour plots for visualizations.\nNonetheless, the formulation itself considers arbitrary anisotropic symmetries and can be\nimplemented in general multiscale FEM codes.\n\nThe results also revealed that the macroscopic yield criteria preserved the overall\nsymmetries of the RVE material matrix. This fact is due to the spherical shape of the cavity\ninside the RVE. However, further works can properly combine the anisotropy provided by\nthe material matrix with that acquired from the morphological effects.\n\nThe trial velocity field proposed by Gurson (1977) proved to be an adequate choice\nfor the developments hereby. However, further works may also explore more elaborate trial\nfields in order to obtain better upper bounds to the RVE problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n101\n\n6 MODELING OF ORTHOTROPIC RUPTURE OF POROUS ALUMINUM AL-\nLOYS\n\nThis chapter presents an approach for modeling anisotropic rupture of porous\naluminum alloys. This approach consists of deriving the macroscopic yield surface of a\nGurson-like RVE whose material matrix follows the Yld2004-18p yield criterion proposed\nby Barlat et al. (2005). The RVE is assumed to undergo uniform macroscopic strain\nrates and the correspondent dissipation potentials are obtained by using Gurson\u2019s trial\nmicroscopic velocity field as a first attempt, which composes an upper bound procedure.\nThe results point out the consistency of including the porosity parameter on the modeling\nof rupture in orthotropic aluminum alloys, as well as the need to account for the porosity\neffect on the resultant macroscopic yield surfaces.\n\n6.1 The Barlat et al. (2005) Yld2004-18p yield criterion\n\nAlthough Karafillis and Boyce (1993) have formulated a convenient way to represent\nanisotropic yield surfaces by the concept of IPE material, their approach did not match\nexperimental results of aluminum sheet forming Barlat et al. (2003). In order to overcome\nthis drawback, Barlat et al. (2003) proposed an anisotropic yield function by applying two\nlinear different transformations over a sum of two distinct yield functions. This method\ndoubled the number of material parameters to be experimentally identified, which thus\nincreased the accuracy in representing aluminum alloys. Banabic et al. (2005) also proposed\nanisotropic yield function based on an extension of Barlat and Lian (1989) model in order\nto include more material parameters. However, these approaches were restricted to plane\nstress formulation.\n\nBarlat et al. (2005) then suggested a consistent manner to derive an anisotropic\nyield surface with more material parameters than Karafillis and Boyce (1993), also based\non linear transformations (Eq. (6.2)), which is thus applicable to 3D full stress states.\nTheir framework uses an arbitrary number of linear transformations instead of only one as\nin Karafillis and Boyce (1993). However, the more linear transformations are considered,\nthe more material coefficients need to be experimentally identified.\n\nAlthough their formulation is consistent with an arbitrary number of linear transfor-\nmations, Barlat et al. (2005) restricts their results and formulae to only two. These linear\ntransformations are then applied to the Cauchy stress tensor ?, defining two auxiliary\ntraceless stress tensors s1 and s2.The linearly transformed stress tensors s1 and s2 are\n\n\n\n102 Chapter 6 Modeling of orthotropic rupture of porous aluminum alloys\n\ndefined in its full tensor form as the following:\n\ns1 =\n(\nC\n\n1 : J\n)\n\n: ? = L1 : ?\n\ns2 =\n(\nC\n\n2 : J\n)\n\n: ? = L2 : ?.\n(6.1)\n\nwhere\n\nCi =\n\n?\n?????????????\n\n0 ?ci12 ?ci13 0 0 0\n?ci21 0 ?ci23 0 0 0\n?ci31 ?ci32 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 ci44 0 0\n0 0 0 0 ci55 0\n0 0 0 0 0 ci66\n\n?\n?????????????\n\nLi = CiJ =\n1\n3\n\n?\n?????????????\n\nbi2 + bi3 ?ci3 ?bi2 0 0 0\n?bi3 bi3 + bi1 ?bi1 0 0 0\n?bi2 ?bi1 bi1 + bi2 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 3bi4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3bi5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3bi6\n\n?\n?????????????\n,\n\n(6.2)\n\nbi1 = (4c\ni\n23 + c\n\ni\n31 ? 2c\n\ni\n12)/3,\n\nbi2 = (4c\ni\n31 + c\n\ni\n12 ? 2c\n\ni\n23)/3,\n\nbi3 = (4c\ni\n12 + c\n\ni\n23 ? 2c\n\ni\n31)/3,\n\nbi4 = c\ni\n44,\n\nbi5 = c\ni\n55 and\n\nbi6 = c\ni\n66\n\nand Ci, Li and J correspond to the Voigt notation matrices(see Appendix A) to the\n4th-order tensors Ci, Li and J, respectively, with J given by Eq. (4.19). The superscript i\nin Eq. (6.2) refers to the i-th linear transformation, i = 1, 2.\n\nIn accordance with their approach, an anisotropic yield criterion was derived by\nwriting an isotropic convex function in terms of the transformed stress tensors s1 and\ns2. According to Eggleston (1958), a convexity of a function is preserved if its arguments\nare transformed by affine operators. This guarantees the convexity of the resultant yield\nfunction ? (s1,s2), Eq. (6.3). Because two linear transformations are involved, this approach\ncan give rise to criteria that can take into account up to 18 parameters of anisotropy.\n\n?(?) = ?(s1,s2) = ?(S11,S\n1\n2,S\n\n1\n3,S\n\n2\n1,S\n\n2\n2,S\n\n2\n3 ), (6.3)\n\n\n\n6.1 The Barlat et al.

This approach consists of an upper bound solution to the BVP posed by the hollow\nspherical RVE, subjected to a macroscopic strain field E? on ??+, whose material matrix\nfollows an incompressible rigid-perfect plasticity model (i.e. Yld2004-18p, normality rule\nand no hardening). Nonetheless, it is important to remark that more refined trial strain\nrate fields will be considered in future work. As already commented in chapter 4 and\nchapter 5, the fields provided by Monchiet and Kondo (2012) and by Li, Sauer and Wang\n(2007) are believed to result in better upper bound estimates.\n\n\n\n6.3 Deduction of the macroscopic dissipation potential 105\n\n6.3 Deduction of the macroscopic dissipation potential\n\nThe microscopic plastic dissipation potential ? associated to a point in RVE domain\n? whose plastic laws satisfy Eq.

However, the derivation of the macroscopic stress\ntensors now requires a more complex approach, since the microscopic plastic dissipation\npotential ? is now dependent on five independent variables instead of only two, as within\nthe formulation for a macroscopic yield criterion based on the model by Karafillis and\nBoyce (1993) for the material matrix (see Eq. (5.39)). Eq.

(6.39)\n\nThe Moore-Penrose inverse L+ can be obtained by the Single Value Decomposition\n(SVD) procedure \u2013 among others (see Ben-Israel and Greville (2003) and Campbell and\nMeyer (2009)) \u2013 by decomposing the original matrix L as\n\nL = U LS V\n?, (6.40)\n\n\n\n114 Chapter 6 Modeling of orthotropic rupture of porous aluminum alloys\n\nwhere U is a m\u00d7m unitary matrix, L is a m\u00d7n matrix, V ? is a n\u00d7n unitary matrix,\nLS is a matrix whose diagonal components are nonnegative, while its other components\nare zero, and\n\nL+ = U L+S V\n?, (6.41)\n\nwhere L+S is obtained by replacing each nonzero diagonal component of LS by its cor-\nrespondent reciprocal value. Additionally, in the particular case of the present chapter,\nm = 12 and n = 6.\n\nAccordingly, the relation in Eq. (6.31) can be thus inverted as in Eq.

The denominator, which is a function of the microscopic strain\nrate Lode angles ?1 and ?2 as well as of the auxiliary angle ? = ??2eq/??1eq, is a much more\ncomplex function to be optimized. Therefore, the choice of an inverse for the rectangular\nmatrix L consists in an additional upper bound approximation.\n\nThe inverses\n(\nL+\n\n)1\nand\n\n(\nL+\n\n)2\nare finally obtained by separating the 12\u00d76 matrix\n\nL+ into two 6 \u00d7 6 blocks:\n\n??\n? ??\n\n1\n\n??2\n\n??\n? = L+?? =\n\n?\n??\n(\nL+\n\n)1\n(\nL+\n\n)2\n?\n?? ??. (6.43)\n\nCoherently to the previous chapters in the present text and to section 6.2, ?? is\napproximated by the trial microscopic strain rate ??G(E?) proposed by Gurson (1977). This\nchoice consists of a rigorous upper bound approach for the minimization problem of the\nmacroscopic plastic dissipation potential ?(E?), and leads to the following implementation\nof ??1 and ??2:\n\n??1(E?) =\n(\nL+\n\n)1\n??G(E?)\n\n??2(E?) =\n(\nL+\n\n)2\n??G(E?).\n\n(6.44)\n\nIt is important to recall one more time that further developments concerning this\nresearch will consider more refined trial velocity fields, as those of Monchiet, Charkaluk\n\n\n\n6.6 Results and discussion 115\n\nand Kondo (2007), Monchiet, Charkaluk and Kondo (2011), Monchiet and Kondo (2012)\nand Li, Sauer and Wang (2007).\n\nRecalling that E? is fully determined by the prescription of both normalized macro-\nscopic strain triaxiality H and Lode angle ? (Eq. (3.28)), each point of the macroscopic\nyield surface in the space of macroscopic stresses is related to a pair (H,?). Hence, one\nmust evaluate Eq. (6.27) for as many pairs (H,?) as possible in their respective domains so\nthat the points comprehend the entire macroscopic yield surface. Due to the computational\ncost of each integration in Eq. (6.27), only a reduced set of ? is calculated for each\nmacroscopic yield surface, which is thus correspondent to the prescribed set of pairs (H,?).\nFurther details of these discretizations are given in section 7.2.\n\nAlong the same lines as the previous chapters, although the implementation is\nnot restricted to the coincidence between the principal directions of the material matrix\nsymmetry and the macroscopic strain rate E?, the graphical visualization based on contour\nlevel plots of the macroscopic yield surfaces is. This limitation derives from the fact that if\nthere is no coincidence between those principal directions, each point of that surface would\nbe defined in a 6-dimensional space, since the shear components of stress would not result\nin zero. Thus, a contour level plot for 6-dimensional would be required, which implies an\nextreme computational cost. Nevertheless, an N-dimensional contour plot procedure is\nproposed in Appendix B for further developments in high performance computing.\n\n6.6 Results and discussion\n\nFollowing the formulation detailed in previous sections, two macroscopic yield\nsurfaces are obtained by modeling a Gurson-like RVE whose material matrix follows the\nYld2004-18p yield criterion. They are intended to insert the porosity effect in the yield\nsurfaces of 6111-T4 and 2090-T3 aluminum alloys presented by Barlat et al. (2005). The\nmaterial matrix coefficients of the RVE are assumed to be those identified by Barlat et\nal. (2005) and listed in Table 6. The shape parameter of the Hershey-Hosford equation is\nchosen to be m = 8, which is in correspondence to a FCC crystal structure. A porosity of\n1% is chosen to represent a critical value for general ductile fracture configurations, as\nindicated by Benzerga, Besson and Pineau (1999). According to section 6.2, only centered\nspherical voids are hereby considered so that every noticeable anisotropic behavior is due\nto the material matrix model.\n\nFigures 35 and 36 respectively compare the anisotropic macroscopic yield surface\nof a porous 6111-T4 and 2090-T3 aluminum alloy to a porous isotropic reference. In\naccordance with the material matrix behaviors, the macroscopic yield surfaces for 6111-T4\n(B1) and 2090-T3 (B2) present a mildly and strongly anisotropic behavior, respectively.\nFigures 35a and 36a compares the macroscopic yield surfaces (B1 and B2) to an isotropic\n\n\n\n116 Chapter 6 Modeling of orthotropic rupture of porous aluminum alloys\n\nreference (I). Although Fig. 35b and 36b do not contain the isotropic reference, a more\nsignificant effect of anisotropy can be noticed by the discrepancy between meridional planes\nrelated to different macroscopic stress Lode angles ?. Both deviatoric and meridional planes\nmatch the expectations about the intensity of the anisotropic effect of the microscopic\nyield criterion on the overall behavior.\n\n?1 0 1\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n??3\n\n??1 ?\n?\n2\n\n6111-T4\nf = 1%\nm = 8\n\n...

Source: the author.\n\nIn the deviatoric planes in Fig. 35a and Fig. 36a, the misalignment of the anisotropic\ncurves naturally becomes more significant as the macroscopic hydrostatic stress ?m\nincreases. Although it cannot be analytically shown for the formulation in this chapter\ndue to the complexity of Eq. (6.27), this effect is believed to be analogous to the one\nobserved in section 5.5, where it has been demonstrated that once the macroscopic IPE\nstress ??? was proved to be centered on the deviatoric plane related to ?m = 0, the linear\ntransformation ?? = L+ : ?? could not result in a misaligned ?? for ?m = 0.\n\nA stronger anisotropic effect might also be noticed in Fig. 36b in comparison with\nFig. 35b, since discrepancies between meridional planes related to different macroscopic\nstress Lode angles ? are more marked in the first than in the last one. Furthermore, the\nmeridional planes are not expected to be asymmetric, since the i) function g(?1,?2 ?) is\nsymmetric with respect to ?1 and ?2 (i.e. g(?1,?2,?) = g(??1,?2,?) = g(?1,??2,?));\nii) the trial strain rate fields ??1 and ??2 are symmetrically distributed inside the domain\n? of the RVE (see Fig. 34); and iii) the void shape shares symmetric planes with the\nmaterial anisotropy.\n\n\n\n6.7 Concluding remarks 117\n\n?2 ?1 0 1 2\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2 ??3\n\n??1 ?\n?\n2\n\n2090-T3\nf = 1%\nm = 8\n\n...

The yield surface of the\nnonporous models are multiplied here by a scalar factor of (1?f), so that the amplification\neffect due to the porosity could be negligible.\n\nBoth Fig. 37a and 37b show that the combination of two linear transformations\non the microscopic stress tensor carried out throughout the formulation proposed in this\nchapter alters the general aspect of the macroscopic yield surfaces slightly. Hence, the\noutcome of inserting the porosity effect in the Yld2004-18p criterion proposed by Barlat\net al.

This difference is believed to be due to the effect of applying two linear\ntransformations instead of just one in the RVE general formulation, even though it was\nnot possible to demonstrate it analytically.\n\nFinally, although the overall results have shown to be in accordance with the\nexpectations, the next steps of research must consist of (i) using more refined trial velocity\nfields with the aim of obtaining better upper bound approximations; and (ii) further\nexperimental works to properly validate the approach presented hereby: differently to\nthose tests made by Barlat et al. (2005), the porosity must also be controlled over the\ncourse of experiments from now on.\n\n\n\n119\n\n7 SOME ASPECTS ON THE NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION\n\n7.1 Numerical integration\n\nThe linearization of the microscopic plastic dissipation potential ?(??G) (Eq. (3.51))\nin the original Gurson (1975) model allowed the macroscopic stress state to be obtained\nanalytically, since the volume integral in Eq. (3.51) \u2013 and implicitly in Eq. (3.52) \u2013 could\nbe solved analytically. However, the anisotropic extensions proposed in chapter 4, chapter 5\nand chapter 6 require the macroscopic stress tensors ? = ??/?E? to be numerically\nobtained (i.e. by using some approximation technique). Thus, a numerical integration\nprocedure based on the Gauss quadrature was implemented to solve integrals in the form\n\n? =\n1\nV\n\n?\n?\n\n??\n\n?E?\ndV. (7.1)\n\nThe spherical shape of the RVEs suggests that a spherical coordinate system (Fig.\n10) should be conveniently used. Thus, the integration in Eq. (7.1) is rewritten as\n\n? =\n1\nV\n\n? R\nrv\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n? ?\n0\n\n??\n\n?E?\nr2 sin ?d?d?dr, (7.2)\n\nwhere\n\nr(x1,x2,x3) =\n?\nx21 + x22 + x23, (7.3)\n\n?(x1,x2,x3) = arctan\nx2\nx1\n, (7.4)\n\n?(x1,x2,x3) = arctan\nx3?\n\nx21 + x22 + x23\n,\n\nx1(r,?,?) = r sin ? cos ?, (7.5)\nx2(r,?,?) = r sin ? sin ?, (7.6)\nx3(r,?,?) = r cos ? and (7.7)\n\ndV = dx1dx2dx3 = r2 sin ?d?d?dr. (7.8)\n\nAlthough a spherical coordinate system is convenient for evaluating a certain\nfunction at a point in the RVE domain, the referential frame associated to that point is\nalso dependent on the point position. This means that, during a numerical integration\nprocedure of Eq. (7.2), each elementary parcel of the macroscopic stress tensor ? would be\ncalculated for a different referential frame. Therefore, the integrand function (i.e. ??/?E?\n\n\n\n120 Chapter 7 Some aspects on the numerical implementation\n\nin Eq. (7.2)) must be rotated to a fixed frame of reference so that each parcel of ? is\nobtained in the same referential: the cartesian one. The corrected integration then holds\n\n? =\n1\nV\n\n? R\nrv\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n? ?\n0\nM(?,?) \u00b7\n\n??\n\n?E?\n\u00b7MT (?,?)r2 sin ?d?d?dr, (7.9)\n\nwhere the rotation tensor M(?,?) is given by\n\nM(?,?) =\n\n?\n????\n\ncos ? sin ? cos ? cos ? ?sin ?\nsin ? sin ? sin ? cos ? cos ?\n\ncos ? ?sin ? 0\n\n?\n???? . (7.10)\n\nThe final expression for the numerical integration of Eq. (7.9) for (N1,N2,N3)\nintegration points in the directions (?,?,r), respectively, and in terms of the natural\ncoordinates (?i,?j,?k) given by the Gauss quadrature, reads\n\n? ?\n1\nV\n\nN3?\nk=1\n\nN2?\nj=1\n\nN1?\ni=1\n\nwk3w\nj\n2w\n\ni\n1\n\n[\nM(?j,?i) \u00b7\n\n??\n\n?E?\n(rk,?j,?i) \u00b7MT (?j,?k)\n\n]\n(rk)2 sin ?iJ?,\n\n(7.11)\nwhere (wi,wj,wk) are the Gauss weights associated to the natural coordinates (?i,?j,?k);\nJ? is the jacobian determinant to map the Gauss natural coordinate system (?i,?j,?k)\nto the spherical one (r,?,?); and the variables (rk,?j,?i) are the spherical coordinates\ndescribed in terms of the Gauss natural coordinate system (?i,?j,?k):\n\nrk = rk(?i,?j,?k) =\n1\n2\n\n[R? rv(?j(?j),?i(?i))](?k + 1) + rv(?j(?j),?i(?i)), (7.12)\n\n?j = ?j(?j) = ?(?j + 1), (7.13)\n\n?i = ?i(?i) =\n?\n\n2\n(?i + 1), (7.14)\n\nJ? = J?(?i,?j,?k) =\n?2\n\n4\n[R? rv(?j(?j),?i(?i))] and (7.15)\n\nrv(?j(?j),?i(?i)) =\n1????(cos ?j sin ?i\n\nr1\n\n)2\n+\n(\n\nsin ?j sin ?i\nr2\n\n)2\n+\n(\n\ncos ?i\nr3\n\n)2 . (7.16)\n\nThe void radius rv = rv(?,?) is assumed to be dependent on the angles ? and\n? because of the possibility of it being an ellipsoid, as in chapter 4. However, for the\nsubsequent chapter 5 and chapter 6, the void is assumed to be spherical and hence the\nvoid radius is constant.\n\nThe results provided in chapter 4, chapter 5 and chapter 6 were obtained by using\nGauss quadrature of (N1,N2,N3) = (40, 40, 40) integration points. However, the isotropic\n\n\n\n7.2 Discretization of the ? and H subspaces 121\n\nresults obtained to illustrate Benallal, Desmorat and Fournage (2014) and Benallal (2017)\nmodels required only (N1,N2,N3) = (15, 15, 15) points to be accurately integrated \u2013\n403/153 ? 28402, which has a strong impact on the computational cost.\n\n7.2 Discretization of the ? and H subspaces\n\nThe trial strain rate field ??G(r,?,?) in Eq. (3.49) is also a function of two macro-\nscopic strain rate invariants: E?m (or H) and ?. This means that ??G not only varies in\nthe space (i.e. in the RVE domain), but also following two additional variables (H,?).\nMoreover, the numerical integration framework given by Eq. (7.11) is related to only a\ngiven pair (H,?), which are purposely implicit in that equation. Therefore, the integration\nin Eq. (7.11) results in solely one stress tensor \u2013 i.e. one point on the macroscopic yield\nsurface. In order to obtain the whole surface, the invariants (H,?) of E? must be treated\nalso as variables and thus require a discretization.\n\nAccording to the definition of the macroscopic strain rate triaxiality (Eq. (3.33)),\nH ? [??,?]. Therefore, its discretization cannot be effectively performed, since it is an\nunbounded domain. To address this issue, a change of variables is hereby proposed. This\nchange does not affect the formulation itself \u2013 neither destroys the conceptual meaning of\nthe triaxiality. The advantage of that change of variables is that the idealized triaxiality\nvariable H? ? [?1/\n\n?\n3, 1/\n?\n\n3]. Thus, a traditional discretization procedure can be applied.\nThe new strain rate triaxiality variable is\n\nH? =\nH?\n\n3\n2\n\n+ 3H2\n(7.17)\n\nand\n\nlim\nH???\n\nH? = ?\n1\n?\n\n3\n, (7.18)\n\nlim\nH?0\n\nH? = 0 and (7.19)\n\nlim\nH??\n\nH? =\n1\n?\n\n3\n(7.20)\n\nIt is important to remark that due to the perfectly rigid-plastic material matrix of\nthe RVE and to the small strains theory used throughout this formulation, the resultant\nmacroscopic stress tensor ? given in Eq. (7.11) is independent on the intensity of E?\n(i.e. on the norm ||E?||). Therefore, ? depends only on the directions of E?, given by its\ntriaxiality H and Lode angle ?. An auxiliary macroscopic strain rate E? can then be defined\n\n\n\n122 Chapter 7 Some aspects on the numerical implementation\n\nin terms of H? and ? in such way that its euclidean norm be unitary:\n\nE? =\nE?\n\n||E?||\n=\n?\n\n2\n3\n\n(1 ? 3H?2)e?(?) + H?1, (7.21)\n\nwhere e?(?) is the unitary deviatoric strain tensor given by Eq. (3.32).\n\nA generalization of the macroscopic strain rate Lode angle ? is also hereby proposed\nfor convenience. Because the classical definition of the Lode angle in Eq. (3.34), ? ? [0,?/3]\nso that the ordination E?1 ? E?2 ? E?3, with E?1 > E?3, can be respected. This is particularly\ninconvenient for the anisotropic analyses treated hereby in which the principal directions\nof E? coincide with the material referential frame (x1,x2,x3). In these analyses, full yield\nsurfaces (i.e. including cases where the stress ordination is not respected) can be obtained\nonly by extending the range of the Lode angle (both ? and ?) to [0, 2?]. This extension\navoids the need to account for permutations of the principal directions that are required\nto obtain full (i.e. closed, not limited to the sector ?1 ? ?2 ? ?3, ?1 > ?3) yield surfaces.\nAn illustration of the extended Lode angle ?? is provided in Fig. 38. This angle can be\ndefined as\n\n?? = sign\n1\n3\n\narccos\n(\n\n4 det E??\n\n(E?eq)3\n\n)\n+\n\n2k?\n3\n, k ? Z (7.22)\n\nwhere\n\nsign = +1 k = 0 forE?1 ? E?2 ? E?3, E?1 > E?3, (7.23a)\nsign = ?1 k = 1 forE?2 ? E?1 ? E?3, E?2 > E?3, (7.23b)\nsign = +1 k = 1 forE?2 ? E?3 ? E?1, E?2 > E?1, (7.23c)\nsign = ?1 k = 2 forE?3 ? E?2 ? E?1, E?3 > E?1, (7.23d)\nsign = +1 k = 2 forE?3 ? E?1 ? E?2, E?3 > E?2, (7.23e)\nsign = ?1 k = 3 forE?1 ? E?3 ? E?2, E?1 > E?2. (7.23f)\n\nAlthough specific anisotropy symmetries implies their respective yield surfaces to\npresent certain symmetry planes as well, as shown by Canova et al. (1985), the results\nhereby presented were obtained by varying the macroscopic strain rate parameters in\ntheir whole range: H? ? [?1/\n\n?\n3, 1/\n?\n\n3] and ?? ? [0, 2?]. Two numerical criteria were then\nimplemented to discretize those variables.\n\nBasically, the Lode angle ?? is uniformly divided in the range [0, 2?] in N?? points.\nDifferently, the triaxiality H? is divided by following a heuristic criterion so that the stress\npoints on meridional planes could be as equally spaced as possible for a fixed number of\npoints NH?. This criterion uses the analytical expressions Eq. (3.54), provided by Gurson\n(1975), to calculate the values of H? for which the macroscopic stress points (?Gm,?Geq)\n\n\n\n7.3 From macroscopic strain rates to macroscopic stresses: Contour (level set) plots 123\n\nE2 E1\n\nE3\n\nE\n\nh\n\nx2 x1\n\nx3\nE1\n\nE3\n\nE\n\nE2\nh\n~\n\nFigure 38: A generalization of the Lode angle concept to arbitrary material referential system.\n\nOn the left, a deviatoric macroscopic strain rate E?? is illustrated lying on the deviatoric plane.\nThe Lode angle ? ? [0,?/3] is then illustrated as the angle formed by the deviatoric axis E??1\nand E??. On the right, the principal macroscopic axes (E??1, E??2, E??3) are positioned in a material\ndeviatoric referential system (x?1,x?2,x?3). A reinterpretation of the Lode angle is then proposed:\nthe angle ?? ? [0, 2?] is measured from the deviatoric material axis x?1 to E??. Source: the author.\n\nobtained by the original Gurson (1975) model can be equally spaced. That discretization\nof H? is thus assumed to be a reasonable estimate for the optimum set of triaxialities that\nshould imply equally spaced (?m,?eq) in macroscopic meridional planes.\n\nThe results presented in chapter 4, chapter 5 and chapter 6 were obtained by\nprescribing N?? = 180 and NH? = 221 (i.e. 180 \u00b7 221 = 39780 pairs (??, H?)) for each\nmacroscopic yield surface. For each of those pairs, a numerical integration of Eq. (7.11)\nbased on the Gauss quadrature with 40 \u00b7 40 \u00b7 40 = 64000 points were therefore performed,\nas indicated in section 7.1.\n\n7.3 From macroscopic strain rates to macroscopic stresses: Contour (level set)\nplots\n\nThe procedure of obtaining macroscopic stress ? points by evaluating Eq. (7.11)\nfor a given number of pairs (?,H?) results in a set of points of ? that certainly lie on\nthe macroscopic yield surface. However, this set of stress points must be interpolated in\nsome way so that an arbitrary stress state that does not necessarily coincide with any of\nthe points in this set \u2013 but that also lies on the yield surface \u2013 could be approximately\nobtained by interpolation. Hence, the interpolation procedure would profit from the yield\nsurface points that would have already been obtained to avoid the need of evaluating the\ndemanding integration in Eq. (7.11) to obtain new points.\n\n\n\n124 Chapter 7 Some aspects on the numerical implementation\n\nThis interpolation procedure is particularly required to obtain meridional and\ndeviatoric level-set curves \u2013 as extensively used in chapter 4, chapter 5 and chapter 6.\nThese curves represent the intersections of the macroscopic yield surface with the following\nplanes: i) meridional (? = ??, where ?? is a prescribed level of ?); and ii) deviatoric\n(?m = ??m, where ??m is a prescribed value of ?m), as illustrated in Fig. 7 and 8.\n\nGenerally, contour (or level-set) plots of an arbitrary surface, represented by a finite\nset ? of points lying on it, can be numerically derived by firstly dividing the surface domain\ninto elements (or subdomains). These subdomains can be defined, for example, by subsets\ncomposed of adjacent points in ?, as illustrated in Fig. 39. Secondly, an interpolation\nprocedure must be performed to obtain the approximated position of new points lying\non a prescribed regular grid in each of those subdomains (Fig. 40). This interpolation\nprocedure must consider a natural (i.e. dimensionless) coordinate system (?1, ?2) (Fig. 41)\nfrom which shape functions ?i(?1, ?2) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 can be deduced, as in Eq. (7.24).\nThe expressions of the interpolated macroscopic stress ?, strain rate Lode angle ? and\ntriaxiality H? are given in Eq. (7.25). Finally, the algorithm must search in each point\nof the regular grids inside each subdomain for those that respect a prescribed level-set\ncondition (e.g. ? = ?? for meridional planes or ?m = ??m for deviatoric planes).\n\n?1\n\n?2\n\n?3 ? m\n\nHj\n?i\n\n(i + 1, j)\n\n(i, j) (i, j + 1)\n\n(i + 1, j + 1)\nsubdomain\n\nYield surface in the the space \n(?1 x ?2 x ?3)\n\nYield surface in the the space (? x H)\n\n? = 2?\n\n? = 0\n\n~\n\n~\n~\n\n~\n\nFigure 39: Illustration of a subdomain of the yield surface in the space of the macroscopic strain\nrates.\n\nSource: the author.\n\n\n\n7.3 From macroscopic strain rates to macroscopic stresses: Contour (level set) plots 125\n\nHj\n\n?i\n\n(i + 1, j)\n\n(i, j) (i, j + 1)\n\n(i + 1, j + 1)\n\nSubdomain\n\nHj\n\n?i\n\nInterpolation to obtain \na regular grid\n\n(i + 1, j)\n\n(i, j) (i, j + 1)\n\n(i + 1, j + 1)\n\n? obtained by integration\n\n? obtained by interpolation\n\n~\n\n~~\n\n~\n\nFigure 40: Interpolation in a subdomain to obtain a regular grid of approximated points lying on\nthe yield surface.\n\nSource: the author.\n\n?1\n\n?2\n\n3\n\n21\n\n4\n\nFigure 41: Natural coordinate system (?1, ?2) in a quadrilateral subdomain.\n\nSource: the author.\n\n?1(?1, ?2) =\n1\n4\n\n(?1 + 1)(?2 ? 1) (7.24a)\n\n?2(?1, ?2) =\n1\n4\n\n(?1 ? 1)(?2 ? 1) (7.24b)\n\n?3(?1, ?2) =\n1\n4\n\n(?1 ? 1)(?2 + 1) (7.24c)\n\n?4(?1, ?2) =\n1\n4\n\n(?1 + 1)(?2 + 1) (7.24d)\n\n\n\n126 Chapter 7 Some aspects on the numerical implementation\n\n?N ? ?N(?1, ?2) = ?\u20221?1(?1, ?2) + ?\n\u2022\n2?2(?1, ?2) + ?\n\n\u2022\n3?3(?1, ?2) + ?\n\n\u2022\n4?4(?1, ?2) (7.25a)\n\n??N ? ??N(?1, ?2) = ??\u20221?1(?1, ?2) + ??\n\u2022\n2?2(?1, ?2) + ??\n\n\u2022\n3?3(?1, ?2) + ??\n\n\u2022\n4?4(?1, ?2) (7.25b)\n\nH?N ?

However, these codes do not account for an important\npeculiarity that arises from the anisotropic yield surfaces obtained hereby. They are not\ncapable of identifying the equivalence of a stress Lode angles ? = 0 ? 2?. Besides, the\nset of points of anisotropic yield surfaces does not necessarily follow a strict increasing\n(or strict decreasing) order of ?, which aggravates the apparent discontinuity between\nadjacent values of ? = 2? ?d?1 and ? = d?2, where d?1 and d?2 are sufficiently small.\n\nThus, an adapted contour function was implemented in Python programming\nlanguage. This code accounts for the periodicity of the parameters to be prescribed as\nlevel-set conditions. The meridional and deviatoric curves throughout this document were\nobtained by using this implementation.\n\n\n\n127\n\n8 CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK\n\nWithin the assumptions considered in this work \u2013 the choice of the trial field and\nRVE geometry \u2013, the modeling of different void morphologies in a Gurson-like spherical\nRVE has shown to be adequate only for high triaxialities. Additionally, these effects\ncould only be noticeable for porosities greater than 1%. This weak influence of the void\nmorphology on the macroscopic anisotropy is actually due to the Gurson\u2019s trial microscopic\nstrain rate field ??G, which was conceived for isotropic models considering spherical voids.\nNotwithstanding, the results show a consistent formulation that accurately captures\nthe influence of ellipsoidal void orientations and motivated the study of matrix-induced\nanisotropy.\n\nThe results obtained when including the anisotropy of the matrix lying on the\nsame kind of assumptions seem encouraging and need to be improved by more elaborate\nkinematically admissible velocity fields associated to anisotropic materials. In these analy-\nses, the resultant macroscopic yield surfaces are sensitive to the anisotropic parameters\nregardless of the material symmetry involved in them.\n\nThe generalization of the microscopic yield criterion to include yield functions such\nas those of Barlat et al. (2005) leads to indefinitely increasing the number of anisotropy\nparameters to characterize porous ductile materials. In the examples shown hereby, yield\nsurfaces of two aluminum alloys are obtained by inserting the effect of a hypothetical\nporosity f = 1%. In both cases, the porosity affected the overall aspect of the yield\nsurfaces even for purely deviatoric loads (i.e. traceless loads whose principal directions\ncoincide with those of the material symmetry). This fact encourages further experimental\ninvestigation on the characterization of porous aluminum alloys based on the formulation\nherein provided.\n\nIn order to be able to apply loads whose principal directions do not coincide with\nthe anisotropic symmetry orientations, these formulations must be implemented in a high\nperformance computing language \u2013 such as High Performance Fortran (HPF), for example,\nwhich is optimized for clustering and multithreading computers. This is required due\nto the necessity of varying the principal directions of the macroscopic strain rate \u2013 and\nnot only its triaxiality and Lode angle \u2013, which substantially increases the computation\ntime. In these cases, the resultant yield surface must be described in terms of the six\ncomponents of the stress tensor, and not only by its three invariants. Consequently, a\nsix-dimensional level-set plot based on Appendix B must be applied so that those yield\nsurfaces could be appropriately visualized in two-dimensional plots. This improvement\nshould also allow trigonal, monoclinic and triclinic anisotropy symmetries to be considered\nin those formulations.\n\n\n\n128 Chapter 8 Conclusions and further works\n\nAnother further step consists of implementing a porosity evolution law associated\nto anisotropic ductile materials. Initially, its formulation must be based solely on the\nvoid growth mechanism by considering the same definition as Gurson (1977) based on\nmass conservation law: f? = (1 ? f) Tr E?. However, the challenging aspect is that the\nmacroscopic hydrostatic strain rate E?m must now be obtained from an anisotropic surface\ndescribed by a set of points, instead of an analytical closed expression.\n\nThe complementation of the present effective yield criteria with a future imple-\nmentation of a porosity evolution law will make possible to apply the resultant model\nin multiscale three-dimensional FEM codes for ductile fracture propagation analyses.\nAlthough this future multiscale implementation will demand a high performance computa-\ntional approach, most of the simplifications commonly assumed to make the development\nof closed-form expression feasible can be overcome.\n\n\n\n129\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nAGARWAL, H.; GOKHALE, A.

It consists of representing symmetric fourth (L) and second-order (??) tensors\nby matrices (L) and vectors (??), respectively. Since the tensors are assumed to hold\nsymmetry (i.e. Lijkl = Likjl = Lkilj and ?ij = ?ji), it avoids the evaluation of unnecessary\noperations, which saves computing time.\n\nFourth-order tensors are represented by conveniently composing its matrix form as\n\nL =\n\n?\n?????????????\n\nL1111 L1122 L1133\n?\n\n2L1123\n?\n\n2L1131\n?\n\n2L1112\nL1122 L2222 L2233\n\n?\n2L2223\n\n?\n2L2231\n\n?\n2L2212\n\nL1133 L2233 L3333\n?\n\n2L3323\n?\n\n2L3331\n?\n\n2L3312?\n2L1123\n\n?\n2L2223\n\n?\n2L3323 2L2323 2L2331 2L2312?\n\n2L1131\n?\n\n2L2231\n?\n\n2L3331 2L2331 2L3131 2L3112?\n2L1112\n\n?\n2L2212\n\n?\n2L3312 2L2312 2L3112 2L1212\n\n?\n?????????????\n\n(A.1)\n\nand second-order tensor in its vector form as\n\n?? =\n\n??????????????\n?????????????\n\n?11\n\n?22\n\n?33?\n2?23?\n2?31?\n2?12\n\n??????????????\n?????????????\n\n(A.2)\n\nDue to the coefficients 2 and\n?\n\n2 conveniently applied in certain positions in the\nmatrix and vector forms (Eq. (A.1) and (A.2)), the following tensor operations can be\neasily performed by using conventional matrix algebra products:\n\n\u2022 Double contraction of a fourth-order tensor by a second-order tensor (L : ??)\n\nL : ?? ? L??; (A.3)\n\n\u2022 Double contraction of between two second-order tensors (?? : ??)\n\n?? : ?? ? ??T ??; (A.4)\n\nand\n\n\u2022 Cross product of two second-order tensors (?? ? ??)\n\n?? ? ?? ? ????T (A.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n145\n\nAPPENDIX B \u2013 A PROCEDURE FOR INTERPOLATION OF\nN-DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONS FROM STRUCTURED MESH DATA\n\nLet us consider a function f : RN?1 ? RN that has been evaluated in n1\u00b7n2\u00b7...\u00b7nN?1\npoints lying on a structured \u2013 but not necessarily regular \u2013 grid such that f(xi) = yi,\nwhere\n\nf(xi) = f(x(i1,i2,...,iN?1)), (B.1)\n\nx(i1,i2,...,iN?1) = (xi11 ,x\ni2\n2 , ...,x\n\niN?1\nN?1 ), (B.2)\n\nand\nyi = (yi1,y\n\ni\n2, ...,y\n\ni\nN ), (B.3)\n\nfor ij = 1, ...,nj, j = 1, ...,N ? 1.\n\nOne assumes that (N ? 1)-dimensional hypercubes constitute (N ? 1)-dimensional\nsubdomains (or elements). The k-th vertex of the (i1, ..., iN?1) \u00d7 (i1 + 1, ..., iN?1 + 1)\nhypercube are positioned at x = xk, where k is the k-th subset \u2013 among 2N?1 possible\nones \u2013 given by the cartesian product (i1, ..., iN?1)\u00d7(i1 + 1, ..., iN?1 + 1). One then defines\na shape function ?k : RN?1 ? R, associated to the k-th vertex of a given subdomain:\n\n?k(?) =\n1\n\n2N?1\n(N?1)?\nk=1\n\n(?k + ak), (B.4)\n\nwhere ? = (?1, ..., ?N?1) is a local coordinate system such that ?k ? [?1, 1] and ak is k-th\nmultisubset (i.e. a subset that can contain repeated elements) obtained from the cartesian\nproduct of the (N ? 1)-dimensional multisubsets (?1, ...,?1) \u00d7 (1, ..., 1).\n\nFor each element, one may thus divide the range of each natural coordinate\n?k ? [?1, 1] so that an auxiliary subgrid be defined inside that element. In each position of\nthis new subgrid the function f can be then approximated by\n\nf(xi(?)) =\n2N?1?\nk=1\n\nf(xk)?k(?), (B.5)\n\nwhere\n\nxi(?) =\n2N?1?\nk=1\n\nxk?k(?). (B.6)\n\nOne may finally verify whether the approximated values of f \u2013 that are obtained in\neach point lying on the subgrid correspondent to each element (i.e. hypercube) \u2013 respect\n\n\n\n146Chapter B A procedure for interpolation of n-dimensional functions from structured mesh data\n\na given level-set condition (e.g. y1 = y2 = ... = yN?2 = 0). The collection of every\napproximated value comprises a level-set solution to the given level-set condition.\n\nFor example, if N = 3, Eq. (B.4) retrieves the two-dimensional interpolation\nfunction given in Eq. (7.24). Furthermore, N = 6 can be used to obtain contour plots of\nsix-dimensional anisotropic yield surfaces.\n\n\n\n147\n\nAPPENDIX C \u2013 THE EXPRESSIONS OF THE DERIVATIVES INVOLVED IN\nTHE CHAPTER 7\n\nC.1 Derivatives in Eq.
