Contudo, no caso do norte-centro de Portugal, pouca investiga\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ntem sido realizada sobre o impacte de v\u00e1rios tipos de gest\u00e3o (como o tipo de \n\nlavragem, corte e retirada da madeira queimada ou tratamentos p\u00f3s-fogo de \n\nmitiga\u00e7\u00e3o da eros\u00e3o) na resposta hidrol\u00f3gica e erosiva de \u00e1reas recentemente \n\nardidas. Este estudo tem como objetivo a medi\u00e7\u00e3o da escorr\u00eancia e eros\u00e3o do \n\nsolo em planta\u00e7\u00f5es de eucalipto e pinheiro durante o primeiro, segundo e \n\nterceiro ano a seguir a um inc\u00eandio.

Experi\u00eancias de \n\nchuva simulada (RSE\u2019s) repetidas no tempo, parcelas de escorr\u00eancia a micro-\n\nescala e barreiras de sedimentos (\u201csediment fence\u201d) foram executadas e/ou \n\ninstaladas imediatamente depois do inc\u00eandio em sete encostas. Os dados de \n\nescorr\u00eancia e eros\u00e3o com chuva natural foram comparados com os dados de \n\nRSE\u2019s, o que se revelou \u00fatil na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da adequabilidade dos dados de \n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o simulada relativamente \u00e0 natural. \n\nComparando com estudos anteriores, os resultados apresentam \n\ncoeficientes de escorr\u00eancia (20-60%) compar\u00e1veis, mas perdas de \n\nsedimentos (125-1000 g m-2) inferiores, a outros no \u00e2mbito nacional e \n\nespecialmente fora de Portugal. As discretas taxas de sedimentos s\u00e3o \n\ncoerentes com um historial de intenso do uso do solo na regi\u00e3o. Na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndessas perdas de sedimentos deve ser considerada a pouca profundidade e \n\npedregosidade destes mesmos, assim como a alta taxa de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica \n\n(50%) nos sedimentos erodidos. Quanto \u00e0s medi\u00e7\u00f5es de eros\u00e3o nos locais \n\nlavrados, estas foram limitadas pela disponibilidade de sedimentos, devido ao \n\nlongo periodo ocorrido (v\u00e1rios anos) desde que as encostas foram lavradas. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nA altera\u00e7\u00e3o da cobertura de manta morta devido \u00e0s actividades de corte e \n\nextra\u00e7\u00e3o da madeira p\u00f3s-fogo incrementou substancialmente as perdas de \n\nsedimentos no eucaliptal e no pinhal. A efectividade do \u201chydromulch\u201d na \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o de escorr\u00eancia (70%) e eros\u00e3o (83%) foi atribu\u00edda ao efeito protetor \n\nproporcionado pelo tratamento. Este tratamento, tamb\u00e9m afetou \n\nsignificativamente a cobertura vegetal e outras propriedades do solo, que por \n\nsua vez tamb\u00e9m reduziram o risco de eros\u00e3o. \n\nA quantidade de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o foi o primeiro factor em explicar a vari\u00e2ncia da \n\nescorr\u00eancia, no entanto, uma mudan\u00e7a de quantidade, para intensidade da \n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o como factor principal foi detectada quando a cobertura do solo\n\naumenta, ou quando existe alguma capacidade de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o (condi\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nhidrof\u00edlicas). A perda de sedimentos foi controlada pela intensidade da \n\nprecipita\u00e7\u00e3o e a cobertura do solo. O efeito da repel\u00eancia \u00e0 \u00e1gua do solo,\n\nsobre a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de escorr\u00eancia, n\u00e3o \u00e9 directo j\u00e1 que os valores totais de \n\nrepel\u00eancia n\u00e3o s\u00e3o suficientes para avaliar seu impacte hidrol\u00f3gico. Contudo, \n\na repel\u00eancia \u00e0 \u00e1gua explicou a variabilidade na gera\u00e7\u00e3o de escorr\u00eancia nos \n\nmodelos espec\u00edficos por \u00e1reas, com maior efic\u00e1cia que os modelos gerais. \n\nAdicionalmente, a humidade do solo est\u00e1 melhor relacionada com os n\u00edveis de \n\nrepel\u00eancia \u00e0 \u00e1gua do solo do que a precipita\u00e7\u00e3o antecedente. Os resultados \n\nda chuva natural confirmaram que as RSE\u2019s representaram bem as taxas \n\nespec\u00edficas de perda de sedimentos, o seu conte\u00fado em mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica,\n\nassim como as diferen\u00e7as entre locais lavrados e n\u00e3o lavrados. As RSE\u2019s \n\ntamb\u00e9m registraram a componente sasonal na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de escorr\u00eancia e \n\nsedimentos, atribu\u00edda ao efeito da repel\u00eancia \u00e0 \u00e1gua do solo.  \n\nEstes resultados t\u00eam implica\u00e7\u00f5es para a modela\u00e7\u00e3o da eros\u00e3o e pr\u00e1ticas \n\nde conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do solo em \u00e1reas ardidas da regi\u00e3o, ou zonas com o mesmo \n\ntipo de uso de solo, clima e caracter\u00edsticas do solo. As perdas de solo \n\nmedidas em conjunto com a crescente frequ\u00eancia em que as \u00e1reas ardidas e \n\nn\u00e3o ardidas est\u00e3o a ser lavradas, sugerem que a lavragem n\u00e3o \u00e9 efectiva para \n\na conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do solo florestal. \u00c9 recomendado o corte da madeira queimada \n\ncom menos impacto, permitindo a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da manta morta para a \n\nprote\u00e7\u00e3o do solo. Dada a elevada efici\u00eancia do \u201chydromulch\u201d em reduzir \n\nescorr\u00eancia e eros\u00e3o, esta t\u00e9cnica \u00e9 indicada para \u00e1reas especialmente \n\nvulner\u00e1veis e sens\u00edveis. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nix \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKey-words \n \n \nAbstract \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwildfire, runoff, erosion, rainfall simulation, soil water repellency, plough,\n\nlogging, eucalypt, pine, hydromulch  \n\n \n\nStrong and sometimes extreme responses in runoff and soil erosion \n\nfollowing wildfires have been reported worldwide. However, in the case of \n\nNorth-Central Portugal, little research had been carried out regarding the \n\nhydrologic and erosive impacts of several land management activities in \n\nrecently burnt areas (such as ground preparation, post-fire logging or post-fire \n\nmitigation treatments). This study aims to assess post-fire runoff and soil \n\nerosion response on Eucalypt and Maritime pine plantations during the first, \n\nsecond and third years following wildfires. The effect of several pre-fire ground \n\npreparation operations (ploughed down-slope, contour ploughed and inclined \n\nterraces), post-fire logging activities (on both the eucalypt and pine plantations), \n\nas well as the application of hydromulch (a post-fire emergency treatment) on \n\noverland flow and soil erosion were compared to burnt but undisturbed and \n\nuntreated areas. The intensive monitoring of runoff, soil erosion and selected \n\nsoil properties served to determine the main factors involved in post-fire runoff \n\nand soil erosion and their spatial and temporal variation. Soil water repellency \n\ndeserved special attention, due to its supposed important role for overland flow \n\ngeneration. Repeated rainfall simulation experiments (RSE\u2019s), micro-scale \n\nrunoff plots and bounded sediment fences were carried out and/or installed \n\nimmediately after the wildfire on seven burnt slopes. Micro-scale runoff plots \n\nresults under natural rainfall conditions were also compared to the RSE\u2019s \n\nresults, which was useful for assessing the representativeness of the data\n\nobtained with artificial rainfall.  \n\nThe results showed comparable runoff coefficient (20-60%) but lower \n\nsediment losses (125-1000 g m-2) than prior studies in Portugal, but especially \n\noutside Portugal. Lower sediment losses were related with the historic intensive \n\nland use in the area. In evaluating these losses, however, the shallowness and \n\nstoniness of the soils, as well as the high organic matter fraction of the eroded \n\nsediments (50%) must not be overlooked. Sediment limited erosion was \n\nmeasured in all the ploughed sites, probably due to the time since ploughing \n\n(several years). The disturbance of the soil surface cover due to post-fire \n\nlogging and wood extraction substantially increased sediment losses at both \n\nthe pine and eucalypt sites. Hydromulch effectiveness in reducing the runoff \n\n(70%) and sediment losses (83%) was attributed to the protective high \n\ncoverage provided by hydromulch. The hydromulch significantly affected the \n\nsoil cover and other soil properties and these changes also reduced the soil \n\nerosion risk.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxi \n \n\n  \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe rainfall amount was the main factor explaining the variance in runoff. \n\nHowever, a shift from rainfall amount to rainfall intensity was detected when \n\neither the surface cover or the infiltration capacity (hydrophilic conditions) \n\nincreased. Sediment losses were controlled by rainfall intensity and surface \n\ncover. The role of soil water repellency on runoff generation was not \n\nconsistent; the overall repellency levels alone were not enough to assess its \n\nhydrological impact. Soil water repellency explained runoff generation in the \n\nspecific-sites model better than in the overall model. Additionally, soil moisture \n\ncontent was a better predictor for soil water repellency than antecedent \n\nrainfall. The natural rainfall results confirmed that RSE\u2019s were able to capture \n\nthe specific sediment losses and its organic matter content as well as the \n\ndifferences between the ploughed and unploughed sites. Repeated RSE\u2019s also \n\ncaptured the seasonal variations in runoff and sediment losses attributed to \n\nsoil water repellency. \n\nThese results have implications for post-fire soil erosion modelling and \n\nsoil conservation practices in the region, or areas with the same land use, \n\nclimate and soil characteristics. The measured sediment loss, as well as the \n\nincreasing frequency of ploughing in recently burnt and unburnt eucalypt \n\nstands, suggests ploughing is not an effective as a soil conservation measure. \n\nLogging activities with less impact are recommended in order to maintain the \n\nforest litter protecting the soil surface. Due to its high effectiveness in reducing \n\nrunoff and soil erosion, hydromulch is recommended for highly sensitive and \n\nvulnerable areas.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nxiii \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPalabras - clave  \n \n \nResumen \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nincendio, escorrent\u00eda, erosi\u00f3n, simulaci\u00f3n de lluvia, repelencia al agua del \n\nsuelo, labrar, corte y extracci\u00f3n, eucalipto, pino, \u201chydromulch\u201d \n\n \n\nEn muchas partes del mundo y en terrenos afectados por incendios \n\nforestales se han registrado respuestas hidrol\u00f3gicas y erosivas  altas o \n\nextremas. No obstante, en el caso del centro-norte de Portugal, existe poca \n\ninvestigaci\u00f3n sobre el impacto de varios tipos de gesti\u00f3n (como el tipo de \n\nlabrado, tala y extracci\u00f3n de la madera quemada o tratamientos post-incendio \n\npara la mitigaci\u00f3n de la erosi\u00f3n) en la respuesta hidrol\u00f3gica y erosiva de \u00e1reas \n\nrecientemente ardidas. El objetivo de este estudio es la medici\u00f3n de la \n\nescorrent\u00eda y erosi\u00f3n del suelo en plantaciones de eucalipto y pino, durante el \n\nprimer, segundo y tercer a\u00f1o tras el incendio. El efecto de diferentes t\u00e9cnicas \n\nde preparaci\u00f3n del suelo (labrado a favor de la pendiente, siguiendo las curvas \n\nde nivel o terrazas inclinadas), de la tala y retirada de la madera quemada as\u00ed \n\ncomo de la aplicaci\u00f3n de \u201chydromulch\u201d (tratamiento post-incendio) sobre la \n\nescorrent\u00eda y la erosi\u00f3n fue comparado con \u00e1reas ardidas pero no alteradas \n\npor el labrado o tratamientos post-incendio. Fue realizada una monitorizaci\u00f3n \n\nintensiva (aproximadamente semanalmente) de la escorrent\u00eda, erosi\u00f3n y \n\nalgunas variables seleccionadas, con el objetivo de determinar los factores \n\nclave en los procesos de generaci\u00f3n de la escorrent\u00eda y la erosi\u00f3n post-\n\nincendio, as\u00ed como su variaci\u00f3n temporal y espacial. La repelencia al agua del \n\nsuelo recibi\u00f3 una atenci\u00f3n especial debido a su supuesto papel en la \n\ngeneraci\u00f3n de escorrent\u00eda. Experiencias de lluvia simulada (RSE\u2019s) repetidas \n\nen el tiempo, parcelas de campo a micro-escala y trampas de sedimentos \n\n(\u201csediment fence\u201d) fueron ejecutadas y/o instaladas inmediatamente despu\u00e9s \n\ndel incendio en siete laderas. Los datos de escorrent\u00eda y erosi\u00f3n de lluvia \n\nnatural fueron comparados con los datos de RSE\u2019s, lo que result\u00f3 \n\nespecialmente \u00fatil para evaluar la representatividad de los datos de lluvia \n\nartificial frente a la lluvia natural. \n\nLos resultados muestran valores de escorrent\u00eda (20-60%) comparables \n\npero menores perdidas de sedimentos (125-1000 g m-2) que estudios \n\nanteriores en Portugal, pero especialmente fuera de Portugal. Las tasas bajas \n\nde sedimentos est\u00e1n en concordancia con un uso del suelo intensivo en la \n\nzona. Igualmente, para evaluar las bajas p\u00e9rdidas de sedimentos deben ser \n\nconsiderados factores como la poca profundidad y pedregosidad de los suelos \n\nas\u00ed como la alta tasa de materia org\u00e1nica (50%) en los sedimentos \n\nerosionados. En todas las \u00e1reas labradas, debido al tiempo transcurrido desde \n\nel labrado (varios a\u00f1os), la erosi\u00f3n fue limitada por la disponibilidad de \n\nsedimentos.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nxv \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLa alteraci\u00f3n del cubierto de manta muerta debido a la tala y extracci\u00f3n de la \n\nmadera quemada increment\u00f3 sustancialmente las p\u00e9rdidas de sedimentos en \n\nel eucaliptal y el pinar. La efectividad del \u201chydromulch\u201d para reducir la \n\nescorrent\u00eda (70%) y la erosi\u00f3n (83%) puede ser atribuida a la cubierta \n\nprotectora proporcionada por el tratamiento. Adicionalmente, el tratamiento \n\nafect\u00f3 significativamente la cobertura y otras propiedades del suelo, lo que \n\ntambi\u00e9n contribuy\u00f3 a reducir el riesgo de erosi\u00f3n. La cantidad de lluvia fue el \n\nprimer factor en explicar la variaci\u00f3n de la escorrent\u00eda. Aunque, un cambio de \n\ncantidad a intensidad de lluvia como factor principal es detectado cuando \n\naumenta la cubierta del suelo o bien alguna capacidad de infiltraci\u00f3n est\u00e1 \n\npresente (condiciones de hidrofilia). La p\u00e9rdida de sedimentos fue controlada \n\npor la intensidad de lluvia y la cobertura del suelo. El efecto de la repelencia al \n\nagua del suelo sobre la generaci\u00f3n de escorrent\u00eda no es directo, ya que los \n\nvalores totales de repelencia no son suficientes para evaluar su impacto \n\nhidrol\u00f3gico. La repelencia al agua explica la generaci\u00f3n de escorrent\u00eda mejor \n\nen los modelos espec\u00edficos por \u00e1reas que en los modelos generales. \n\nAdicionalmente, la humedad del suelo resulta ser un mejor indicador para la \n\nrepelencia al agua del suelo que la precipitaci\u00f3n previa. Los resultados de \n\nlluvia natural confirman que las RSE\u2019s capturaron bien las tasas espec\u00edficas \n\nde p\u00e9rdida de sedimentos, su contenido en materia org\u00e1nica as\u00ed como las \n\ndiferencias entre laderas labradas y no labradas. Las RSE\u2019s repetidas tambi\u00e9n \n\ncapturaron la componente estacional de la escorrent\u00eda y sedimentos atribuida \n\nal efecto de la repelencia al agua del suelo. \n\nEstos resultados tienen implicaciones para la modelaci\u00f3n de la erosi\u00f3n y \n\npr\u00e1cticas de conservaci\u00f3n del suelo en \u00e1reas ardidas de la regi\u00f3n, o zonas \n\ncon el mismo tipo de uso del suelo, clima y caracter\u00edsticas del suelo. Las \n\np\u00e9rdidas de suelo medidas conjuntamente con la creciente frecuencia en que \n\nlas \u00e1reas ardidas o no ardidas est\u00e1n siendo labradas, sugieren que el labrado \n\nno es efectivo para la conservaci\u00f3n del suelo forestal. Son aconsejables talas \n\ny cortes cuidadosos de la madera quemada con menor impacto y que \n\npermitan la conservaci\u00f3n de la manta muerta para la protecci\u00f3n del suelo. \n\nDada la alta efectividad del \u201chydromulch\u201d para reducir la escorrent\u00eda y la \n\nerosi\u00f3n, se recomienda esta t\u00e9cnica para \u00e1reas especialmente vulnerables y \n\nsensibles.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nContents \nAcknowledgements            i \n\nResumo             v \n\nAbstract              ix \n\nResumen           xiii \n\n1 Introduction .................................................................................................................27 \n\n1.1 The occurrence of wildfires in Portugal .................................................................29 \n\n1.2 The effects of wildfires on runoff and soil erosion .................................................30 \n\n1.3 Predicting soil erosion risk and its mitigation in recently burnt areas .....................34 \n\n1.4 Measuring post-fire runoff and erosion risk ...........................................................36 \n\n1.5 Aim and objectives ...............................................................................................38 \n\n1.6 Thesis structure ....................................................................................................39 \n\n1.6.1 Part 1: Post-fire soil erosion risk assessment: ................................................39 \n\n1.6.2 Part 2: Simulated versus Natural rainfall: .......................................................40 \n\n1.6.3 Part 3: Key factors affecting runoff and sediment losses: ...............................42 \n\nChapter 2: Post-fire overland flow generation and inter-rill erosion under simulated rainfall \nin two eucalypt stands in north-central Portugal. ..............................................................43 \n\nChapter 3: Assessing the role of pre-fire ground preparation operations and soil water \nrepellency in post-fire runoff and inter-rill erosion by repeated rainfall simulation \nexperiments in Portuguese eucalypt plantations (Malvar et al., 2013). .............................61 \n\nChapter 4: Overland flow and inter-rill erosion under natural rainfall in two recently burnt \neucalypt plantations in north-central Portugal (Malvar et al., to be submitted). .................79 \n\nChapter 5: Effectiveness of hydro-mulching to reduce runoff and erosion in a recently \nburnt and logged Maritime Pine stand in north-central Portugal (Prats et al., to be \nsubmitted) ...................................................................................................................... 117 \n\nChapter 6: Temporal variation in topsoil water repellency in two recently burnt eucalypt \nstands in north-central Portugal (Keizer et al., 2008)...................................................... 135 \n\n7 Overall discussion and general conclusions .............................................................. 151 \n\n7.1 Overall runoff and erosion rates.......................................................................... 153 \n\n7.2 Temporal patterns in runoff and erosion ............................................................. 163 \n\n7.3 Key factors explaining runoff and erosion ........................................................... 164 \n\n7.4 Natural versus simulated rainfall ......................................................................... 166 \n\n7.5 Soil water repellency .......................................................................................... 170 \n\n7.6 General conclusions ........................................................................................... 174 \n\nReferences .................................................................................................................... 177 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n29 \n \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\n1.1 The occurrence of wildfires in Portugal  \n\n \n\nPortugal and the Mediterranean countries of Europe in general have a long land-use \n\nhistory, during which high density human populations have systematically managed \n\nand used the agricultural and forest lands (Moreira et al., 2001). In the past century, \n\nhowever, land use in the Mediterranean Basin has suffered major transformations. A \n\ngeneralized rural exodus caused land abandonment and, at the same time, \n\nafforestation of former agricultural land (Moreno, 1999). In north-central Portugal, there \n\nwas first a shift from grazing lands to Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) plantations in \n\nthe 1930s. In the 1970s, eucalypt \u2013 an exotic tree species (Eucalypt globulus Labill.) - \n\nwas introduced and, due to its faster growth and higher economic profitability, then \n\ngradually replaced the Maritime Pine stands (Coelho 1995a). Eucalypt has become the \n\nprincipal tree species in Portugal, covering 812.000 ha or 26 % of the forested area \n\n(AFN, 2011).  \n\nThe above mentioned changes in land use have raised widespread concerns about \n\nthe sustainability of the current situation in Portugal, also because profound changes in \n\nthe landscape are often associated with increasing rates of habitat loss and \n\nfragmentation (Teixido et al., 2010). The traditional agro-silvicultural system was \n\ncharacterized by the extensive exploitation of the forest resources for timber, fuel, \n\ngrazing, livestock bedding, and cropping (Rego, 1992). Also, prescribed fires were \n\nused to clear forest lands for grazing and/or cropping. The resulting landscape was a \n\nhighly heterogeneous and had a patchy organization of multiple habitats with elevated \n\nbiodiversity but also low wildfire risk. This low fire risk was still evidenced during the \n\ndecade from 1950 to 1960, when, on average, some 5.000 ha year-1 were burnt by \n\nwildfire in Portugal (Ferreira et al., 2009). By comparison, during the past three \n\ndecades (1980-2010), over 3.000.000 ha were burnt in Portugal, which corresponds to \n\nroughly 110.000 ha year-1, (AFN, 2011) (Figure 1). This increase in wildfire incidence \n\nand burnt area is generally attributed to a combination of land abandonment and \n\nsubsequent shrub encroachment, on the one hand, and, on the other, widespread \n\nafforestation with flammable tree species, both leading to an increase in fuel \n\naccumulation (Moreira et al. 2001; Lloret et al. 2002; Moreira et al. 2009; Carmo et al. \n\n2011; Shakesby, 2011).   \n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central \nPortugal \n\n30 \n \n\nWildfires have become the most important factor for land cover change in Portugal \n\n(Pereira and Santos 2003). They also constitute a major threat to the economic viability \n\nof commercial forestry and to the ecological health of the ecosystems affected by high \n\nfire incidence (Nunes et al., 2005). A recent study estimated that the wildfire return \n\ninterval for the various ecological regions in Portugal now varies between 23 and 52 \n\nyears, with the interval being shortest for the region where this research occurred \n\n(Fernandes et al., 2012). \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Number of wildfires and burnt area in Portugal from 1980 to 2012 (ICFN, 2012). \n\n \n\n1.2 The effects of wildfires on runoff and soil erosion \n\n \n\nWildfires can be a major contributor of soil erosion and land degradation, provoking \n\na disturbance whose impacts decrease with time during the so-called \u201cwindow-of-\n\ndisturbance\u201d (Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2005; Shakesby, 2011). Fires have been found to \n\ninduce changes in soil\u2019s physical, chemical and biological properties, in vegetation and \n\nfauna, and in geomorphological and hydrological processes, including water quality \n\n(Debano et al., 1998; Doerr et al., 2000; Shakesby and Doerr 2006; Vila-Escal\u00e9 et al., \n\n2007; Doerr et al., 2009a; Llorret and Zedler 2009, Moody and Martin 2009; Mataix-\n\nSolera et al., 2011; Campos et al. 2012).

Rainfall and its characteristics \n\nare the main factors controlling soil erosion (Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2005; \n\nVega et al., 2005, Spigel and Robichaud, 2007; Scott et al., 2009). Time-elapsed since \n\nthe fire within the window of disturbance is also an important factor, with the first rainfall \n\nevents being the most erosive ones as the soils are still largely bare and most \n\nvulnerable (Wagenbrenner et al., 2006, Spigel and Robichaud, 2007, Gonzalez-Pelayo \n\net al., 2006). Vegetation and litter cover also play an important role in soil erosion \n\nresponse through the direct protection of rainfall drops impacts, their water retention \n\ncapacity and the protection of soil to overland flow (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). The \n\nburning of the vegetation leads also to a reduction in transpiration and evaporation. \n\nAsh cover can initially enhance infiltration capacity and reduce overland flow (Cerd\u00e0 \n\nand Doerr, 2008; Leighton\u2013Boyce et al., 2007; Woods and Balfour 2008; Cerd\u00e0 and \n\nRobichaud, 2009), but, in addition, ash can block the soil pores and increase the \n\nlikelihood of overland flow (Scott et al., 2009). Bare soil exposure leaves the soil \n\nunprotected and more susceptible to rain drop impact and overland flow removal (Terry \n\nand Shakesby, 1993; Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2005). In stony soils, rock \n\nfragment cover tends to delay runoff, increase infiltration rates and diminish the soil \n\nerosion rates (Cerd\u00e0, 2001; Zavala et al., 2010).  \n\nSoil water repellency is widely considered one of the main factors in enhancing \n\nrunoff generation following wildfire (e.g. Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Leighton-Boyce et \n\nal., 2007; Sheridan et al., 2007; Cerd\u00e0 and Robichaud, 2009). The effects of burning \n\nand its influence on soil water repellency can be highly variable (Doerr et al., 1996; \n\nDoerr et al., 2004). Infiltration excess overland flow (Horton overland flow) is generated \n\nas a result of post-fire soil water repellency, but the presence of a wettable surface \n\nlayer above a strongly repellent layer can induce a shallow layer of saturation overland \n\nflow (Doerr et al. 2009a). In north-central Portugal, soil water repellency is widely held \n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central \nPortugal \n\n32 \n \n\nto play a key role in the temporal patterns of the hydrological post-fire response, \n\nespecially in eucalypt plantations (Prats et al., 2012; Malvar et al., 2011, 2013 (see \n\nchapter 2 and 3), Ferreira et al., 2000; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Coelho et al., \n\n2004). Both long unburnt and recently burnt eucalypt stands in the region are typically \n\nassociated with very high to extreme repellency levels under dry soil moisture \n\nconditions (e.g. Doerr et al. 1998, 2003, 2006; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005; Keizer et \n\nal., 2005a, 2005b, 2008). A recent review of fire effects on soils has identified the need \n\nfor more research on the relative effects of soil water repellency, ground cover, soil \n\nsealing and soil disaggregation as well as the effects of rehabilitation treatments on \n\npost-fire infiltration and runoff (Cerd\u00e0 and Robichaud, 2009). Additional studies are \n\nneeded to determine the relationship between soil water repellency and infiltration rate \n\nmeasured either at point, plot or larger scale (Doerr et al., 2009a).   \n\nBesides wildfire itself, post-fire forestry practices can contribute markedly to an \n\nenhanced hydrological and erosion response in recently burnt areas (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., \n\n2007; Shakesby, 2011). In the region under study, rip-ploughing in down slope \n\ndirection to prepare eucalypt planting was found to increase sediment losses to rates \n\nwell beyond those immediately after fire (Walsh et al., 1995; Shakesby et al., 1996). \n\nSoil preparation operations, such as contour ploughing and terracing (Figure 2), are \n\nalso regularly used in north-central Portugal, but their erosion implications have been \n\npoorly studied so far. The role of past operations in post-fire erosion (e.g. when the \n\nploughing occurred several years before the wildfire) has equally received little \n\nresearch attention, even though the region\u2019s forest lands are an intricate mosaic of \n\nterraced, ploughed and unploughed terrains (Figure 3).  \n\nIn north-central Portugal, several post-fire soil erosion studies, across spatial scales \n\nranging from plot to small catchment, were carried out during the 1990\u2019s and the early \n\n2000\u2019s (e.g. Walsh et al., 1995; Shakesby et al., 1993,1994,1996; Ferreira et al., 1997; \n\nCoelho et al., 2004; Ferreira et al., 2005b, 2008). Nevertheless, most of these studies \n\ndid not address the erosion in first 1-2 years after the fire and they were related mainly \n\nwith pine (Ferreira et al., 2005b) rather than eucalypt stands. Likewise, other fire \n\nrelated erosion research needs, the evaluation of land management (Fernandez et al., \n\n2010; Shakesby, 2011) and soil conservation measures (Robichaud, 2005) had \n\nreceived less attention, with only a few studies (Walsh et al., 1995; Shakesby et al., \n\n1994; 1996; Prats et al., 2012).  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n33 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Many \n\nmodels exist for predicting runoff and erosion but only a few have been adapted to \n\npost-fire environment (Robichaud et al., 2009). Still, progress in understanding wildfire-\n\ninduced soil erosion might be best achieved by shifting to a paradigm of large-scale \n\nbioregional variants rather than continuing to try to apply a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 post-fire \n\nsoil erosion model to all regions (Shakesby et al., 2007).  A model-based risk \n\nassessment tool for the specific conditions of the Portuguese main forests (also \n\nincluding other regions in the N-W Iberian Peninsula) should take into consideration \n\nregional factors such as: (i) socio-economic factors affecting fire ignition and \n\nrecurrence as well as land management and property; (ii) pronounced spatial variability \n\nas a consequence of multiple pre- and post-fire management options (unploughed, rip-\n\nploughing, terracing, logging, new planting, regrowth or no action) in small size land \n\nproperties mosaic with a dense network of forests tracks and roads; (iii) pronounced \n\ntemporal-seasonal variability in runoff and sediment losses. \n\nIn Portugal, only after the severe fire seasons of 2003 and 2005 have forest fires \n\nbecome an important public concern (Ferreira et al., 2008) which motivated an \n\ninstitutional effort towards a post-fire soil erosion risk assessment and subsequent \n\nmitigation strategies (Figure 1). The National Water Institute (INAG) did, in fact, predict \n\nsoil erosion risk in recently burnt areas, producing a nation-wide map based on the \n\n\u201cUniversal Soil Loss Equation\u201d (USLE) (Wischmeier and Smith 1978, INAG, 2003; \n\nBrand\u00e3o and Rodrigues, 2006). INAG\u2019s application of USLE, however, had several \n\ndrawbacks. First, the empirical-based USLE model was designed as a management \n\ntool for agricultural lands. Second, and perhaps most important, was the almost total \n\nlack of field data supporting the model\u2019s suitability (calibration and validation) for post-\n\nfire conditions (e.g. Laflen and Moldenhauser, 2003; Morgan, 2005). Such a lack is \n\nhighlighted by the map legend showing soil erosion classes of 0-1, 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-16 \n\nand >16 t ha-1 year-1. Those values were well above most of data found in the literature \n\nfor Mediterranean countries (many plot-scale studies recording first year post-wildfire \n\nlosses of 1 t ha-1 and the majority were&lt;10 t ha-1; e.g. Shakesby, 2011). Third, the map \n\nconcerning the immediate post-fire situation had limited temporal variability, even \n\nthough the natural conditions change rapidly after fire, including the intensive land \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n35 \n \n\nmanagement. Subsequently, several government manuals to guide rehabilitation and \n\nrestoration strategies were published (DGRF, 2005; SNIRH, 2005), but those manuals \n\nwere focused on post-fire soil mitigation treatments, the selection of target areas was \n\nnot mentioned, or the selection was based on USLE. Some research efforts have been \n\nmade to verify USLE for post-fire conditions or to apply other models, such as the \n\nMorgan-Morgan-Finney model (MMF, Morgan, 2001) (Vieira et al., 2010). More \n\nrecently, with the main aim of scientific knowledge transfer, a publication on fire \n\necology and burnt areas restoration (Moreira et al., 2010) provided an overview of the \n\nglobal and specific Portuguese research needs and forest conditions. In this book, the \n\nintervention areas selection criteria is a combined tool of high degradation risk, low \n\nregeneration capacity indicators and values at risk. The soil erosion hazard is \n\ncalculated based on USLE.  \n\nIn Portugal, post-fire emergency treatments have rarely been employed, although \n\nthis situation is changing due to the implementation of EU Rural Development \n\nProgramme (2007-2013), such as PRODER-funded stabilization measures (under sub-\n\nAction 2.3.2.1 \u201cRestoring Forestry Potential\u201d) for selected 2010 and 2012 burnt areas. \n\nInstitutional technical reports were elaborated to propose and evaluate emergency \n\ntreatments for specific wildfires (29 technical reports between 2010 and 2012; ICFN, \n\n2012). The selection of target areas was not mentioned, or was vaguely expressed as \n\nbased on slope angle (slope angle > 20\u00ba) or on field-based surveys. In the case of the \n\nTavira 2012 wildfire (Algarve-South Portugal), the selection of the soil erosion risk \n\nareas was determined by using the Modified USLE model (MUSLE; Renard et al., \n\n1991). In that case, the Regional Forestry authority produced a map which predicted \n\nsoil losses ranging from less than 5 t h-1 year -1 to more than 200 t h-1 year -1 (ICNF, \n\n2012). The predicted values were again an over estimation of most of the available \n\npost-fire erosion data in Portugal or other Mediterranean countries. In spite of the \n\ninstitutional effort, the lack of data and information, as well as the lack of \n\ncommunication between scientists and land managers, revealed limitations in the \n\nadvancement towards appropriate post-fire management strategies. In addition, the \n\nmajority of private forest owners are unfamiliar with post-fire intervention techniques. \n\nTheir intervention relies on logging and (re)plantation with eucalypts, frequently after \n\nploughing or terracing. Nonetheless, many land owners would be keen to learn more \n\nabout these techniques and even would consider implementing them, if the financial \n\nburden is minimal (Coelho et al., 2011). At this early stage of post-fire mitigation \n\ntreatments application, the problem is obtaining agreement among professionals and \n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central \nPortugal \n\n36 \n \n\nresearchers involved in forest fire management, as to how to identify areas for \n\nintervention (Ferreira et al., 2009). In such a context, the development of a predictive \n\npost-disturbance erosion model tool, tailored to the specificities of post-fire conditions \n\nin Portugal\u2019s forests seems appropriate.  \n\n \n\n1.4 Measuring post-fire runoff and erosion risk  \n\n \n\nA major difficulty in developing a post-fire soil erosion risk assessment tool is the \n\ncollection of representative data on runoff and erosion. Direct measurement of hillslope \n\nrunoff and erosion may be expensive, complex, and labour-intensive but it is \n\nindispensable for developing and refining predictive models of the post-fire response, \n\nboth with and without erosion mitigation measures (Robichaud, 2009). Few datasets \n\nprovide the necessary detail to calibrate or validate the model performance accurately, \n\nespecially when the description of the temporal-spatial heterogeneity of soil loss is a \n\ngoal (Brazier 2004). Therefore, several reviews have noted the necessity to focus on \n\nmonitoring soil erosion by field measurements rather than on modelling (Brazier 2004; \n\nVerheijen et al., 2009). Ideally, the approaches to field measurement would be \n\ndeveloped in conjunction with process-based models (Verheijen et al., 2009) including \n\ntemporal and spatial variations of soil water repellency (Lemmnitz et al., 2008). Thus, \n\nthough monitoring of soil loss is vital for model improvement, it must also be treated as \n\na goal in itself to aid soil conservation and to inform managers and policy makers alike \n\nas to the erodibility of soils (Brazier 2004). The EROSFIRE project (Keizer et al., 2006, \n\n2007) set out to develop a model-based risk assessment tool for Portugal conditions in \n\na combined measurement and modelling approach. Rainfall simulation experiments \n\n(RSE\u2019s) were selected as the principal method for gathering the data required for initial \n\ncalibration of the process- based model MEFIDIS (Nunes et al., 2005) for post-fire \n\nconditions, much along the lines of the approach applied in Nunes et al. (2009a, \n\n2009b). \n\nIn this thesis, elaborated on the framework of the EROSFIRE project, plot runoff and \n\nerosion were measured at medium-short term intervals under simulated and natural \n\nrainfall. RSE\u2019s have been widely used to study hydrological and erosion processes in \n\nrecently burnt woodland areas, especially at spatial scales of 1 m2 and less (e.g. \n\nSevink et al., 1989; Imeson et al.,1992; Kutiel et al.,1995; Benavides-Solorio and \n\nMacDonald, 2001; Johansen et al., 2001; Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2005; Coelho et al., 2005; \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n37 \n \n\nFerreira et al.,2005a; Rulli et al., 2006; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Sheridan et al., \n\n2007). Despite the temporal variability observed in post-fire runoff and sediment losses, \n\nthe bulk of those RSE\u2019s studies refer to a singular time span after wildfire. Only Cerd\u00e0 \n\nand Doerr (2005) and Sheridan et al. (2007) measured runoff and sediment over \n\nvarious time periods after the fire. In Portugal, few field RSE\u2019s studies have been \n\ncarried out in recently burnt eucalypt stands (Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007) or in other \n\nprevailing forest types (Walsh et al., 1998; Coelho et al., 2004; Ferreira et al., 2005a).  \n\nRSE\u2019s remove the variability of natural rainfall, allowing rainfall and runoff \n\nmeasurements to be related to infiltration and erosion rates with more confidence \n\n(Cerd\u00e0 and Robichaud, 2009a). RSE\u2019s can avoid the confounding effects of temporal \n\nand spatial variability and, thus, facilitate the comparison of results obtained at different \n\ntimes after a particular wildfire, as well as in study areas burnt by different wildfires \n\n(e.g. Cerd\u00e0, 1998) or with different land management (e.g. Malvar et al., 2011, 2013, \n\nchapter 2 and 3). To overcome the difficulties of monitoring the high spatial-temporal \n\nvariations of post-fire runoff and erosion, RSE\u2019s were used as a comparatively cheap \n\nand fast method to gather significant amounts of data under distinct land management \n\nconditions. To capture the pronounced temporal variability in hydrological and erosion \n\nprocesses following wildfires, repeated RSE\u2019s field campaigns were carried out in six \n\nfield campaigns during a two years time period after fire. However, RSE\u2019s have well-\n\nknown limitations in terms of reproducing natural rainfall events (e.g. Rickson, 2001). \n\nThe additional monitoring of similar micro-plots, at the same sites and during the same \n\ntwo post-fire years, allowed the direct comparison of natural and artificial rainfall \n\nresults. Few studies have employed both methods simultaneously thus this is an \n\nimportant advancement in science since exhaustive comparison of both methods had \n\nrarely been made.  \n\nDependency of erosion measurements on spatial and temporal scale is well known \n\n(Morgan, 2005; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Ferreira et al., 2008). At the micro-plot \n\nscale employed in this study, either with natural or artificial rainfall, the plots do not \n\nreflect the continuity of the system. However, the plots present some advantages, such \n\nas the control of the variables inside the plot (Morgan, 2005), allowing the quantification \n\nof overland flow and erosion rates at a given period per unit of area, an estimation of \n\nthe water infiltrated, and a detailed spatial and temporal assessment of hydrological \n\nand erosion processes. Closed plots also provided a comparison of different responses \n\nat the same spatial scale. Nevertheless, variability between replicated plots is observed \n\nand it can be explained by natural variability and partly by the alteration of field \n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central \nPortugal \n\n38 \n \n\nmeasurement (measurement variability) (Nearing et al., 1999). Long term monitoring \n\nperiods are needed in order to produce realistic soil erosion assessment. However, a \n\nmedium-short term monitoring period provided qualitative conclusions and the \n\nidentification of areas that are especially exposed to erosion (Leser et al., 2002).  \n\n \n\n1.5 Aim and objectives \n\n \n\nThe main aim of this thesis is to contribute to a better knowledge of the hydrological \n\nand soil erosion response, at the patch scale, in recently burnt areas by focussing on \n\nthe role of pre- and post-fire forest land management conditions. Furthermore, the \n\ncollected runoff, erosion and ancillary data are envisaged as a basis for testing and \n\nadapting existing soil erosion models, for post-fire conditions. The specific objectives \n\nwere to: \n\n1. Quantify post-fire overland flow generation and associated sediment losses at \n\nseven forest stands that typify the range of post-fire conditions in north-central \n\nPortugal, including : (i) eucalypt and maritime pine plantations, (ii) a range of soil \n\npreparation techniques that had been carried out before the wildfires (i.e. unploughed, \n\nrip-ploughed in down-slope direction and along contours, and terraced), (iii) three types \n\nof post-fire land management: no management, logging and tree removal and hydro-\n\nmulching, which is a post-fire emergency treatment; \n\n2. Determine the spatial variation as well as temporal patterns in the post-fire \n\nrunoff and erosion response during the first two years following fire, by implementing \n\nmultiple-plot experimental designs and by repeated rainfall simulation experiments \n\n(RSE\u2019s) on multiple occasions, and by monitoring erosion plots with a high temporal \n\nresolution (1 weekly intervals); \n\n3. Identify the key factors explaining post-fire runoff and soil erosion, in particular \n\nrainfall amount, (simulated) rainfall intensity and land-use related variables such as soil \n\nwater repellency and ground cover, including effects of hydromulching; \n\n4. Address the similarities of repeated rainfall simulation experiments (RSE\u2019s) \n\nwith natural rainfall conditions, by comparing the runoff and erosion rates and their \n\ntemporal patterns produced by the RSE\u2019s with those by natural rainfall events;  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n39 \n \n\n5. Determine the temporal patterns in post-fire soil water repellency in two \n\neucalypt stands, and relate them to changes in antecedent rainfall and soil moisture \n\ncontents. \n\n \n\n1.6 Thesis structure \n\n \n\nThe present thesis was done as part of the framework of two FCT-\u201cFunda\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nCi\u00eancia e Tecnolog\u00eda\u201d funded projects; the EROSFIRE (POCI/AGR/60354/2004) and \n\nthe EROSFIRE-II (PTDC/AGR-CFL/70968/2006) with co-funding by FEDER through \n\nthe POCI2010 Programme and the research grant of the author \n\n(SFRH/BD/41320/2007). \n\n The thesis is structured in three main topics: \n\n1.6.1 Part 1: Post-fire soil erosion risk assessment: \n\nPost-fire overland flow generation and soil erosion response was measured in two \n\nPortuguese forest types, Eucalyptus globulus Labill and Pinus pinaster Ait. The studied \n\nburnt areas were located in North-Central Portugal (Figure 4). Measurements were \n\ncarried out with different methodologies under contrasting pre- and post-fire land \n\nmanagement (Table 1).  \n\nIn Chapter 2 repeated rainfall simulation experiments (RSE\u2019s) were used to gather \n\npost-fire runoff and soil erosion data in two eucalypt stands with two different pre-fire \n\nland management (unploughed vs. down slope rip-ploughing). Chapter 3 was an \n\nextension of Chapter 2 in two ways. On the one hand, it included pre-fire contour \n\nploughing and terracing, two other pre-ground preparation operations that, unlike down \n\nslope ploughing, are well-established soil conservation practices. On the other hand, \n\ntwo additional unploughed eucalypt plantations that were burnt by a different wildfire in \n\nwhich one was logged during the study period (Table 1). In both chapters, two rainfall \n\nintensities were applied; high (45-50 mm h-1; intensity comparable to the maximum \n\nhourly rainfall for a 100-year return period measured at the Aveiro rainfall station) and \n\nextreme (80-85 mm h-1; maximum hourly rainfall ever recorded in Portugal). The RSE\u2019s \n\nwere done at fixed plots on four occasions during the first year following wildfire and on \n\ntwo additional occasions during the second year.  \n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central \nPortugal \n\n40 \n \n\nIn Chapters 4 and 5, runoff and soil erosion was measured under natural rainfall \n\nconditions with high temporal resolution (weekly) across different plot size classes, \n\nfrom micro-plot (0.25 m2) to plot scale (10 m2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

The RSE\u2019s require much less time \n\nand effort and are easily repeatable compared to natural rainfall plots. Therefore, direct \n\ndataset comparison is intended to asses RSE\u2019s as an alternative method to gather \n\nerosion data. \n\nStatistical analyses were carried out, on both simulated and natural rainfall datasets, \n\nto get a further insight into the temporal and spatial variability of hydrological and soil \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n41 \n \n\nerosion response after fires. However, due to basic methodology differences (mainly in \n\nthe number of observations) the statistical methods employed in each case were not \n\nthe same. The limited number of samples gathered with simulated rainfall posed \n\ndifficulties to verify the key assumptions underlying the parametric tests.  \n\nTable 1.

Soil water repellency \n\nwas a recurring factor across all the study sites and methodologies in this thesis. In \n\nChapter 6 the soil water repellency temporal and spatial variation was analyzed in \n\ndetail for an unploughed and down-slope rip-ploughed eucalypt sites. Antecedent \n\nrainfall and soil moisture were studied as possible explanatory variables for the \n\nobserved temporal and spatial soil water repellency patterns. Soil water repellency was \n\nmeasured using the \u201cMolarity of Ethanol Droplet\u201d (MED-test).

Repeated RSE\u2019s were carried out in two\n\nadjacent but contrasting eucalypt stands on steep hill slopes in north-central Portugal that suffered a\n\nmoderate severity fire in July 2005. This was done at six occasions ranging from 3 to 24 months after the\n\nfire and using a paired-plot experimental design that comprised two pairs of RSE\u2019s at each site and\n\noccasion. Of the 46 RSE\u2019s: (i) 24 and 22 RSE\u2019s involved application rates of 45\u201350 and 80\u201385 mm h?1,\n\nrespectively; (ii) 22 took place in a stand that had been ploughed in down slope direction several years\n\nbefore the wildfire and 24 in an unploughed stand.\n\nThe results showed a clear tendency for extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s to produce higher runoff amounts\n\nand greater soil and organic matter losses than the simultaneous high-intensity RSE\u2019s on the\n\nneighbouring plots. However, there existed marked exceptions, both in space (for one of the plot pairs)\n\nand time (under intermediate soil water repellency conditions). Also, overland flow generation and\n\nerosion varied significantly between the various field campaigns. This temporal pattern markedly\n\ndiffered from a straightforward decline with time-after-fire and rather suggested a seasonal\n\ncomponent, reflecting broad variations in topsoil water repellency. The ploughed site produced less\n\nrunoff and erosion than the unploughed site, contrary to what would be expected if the down slope\n\nploughing had occurred after the wildfire instead of several years before it. Finally, sediment losses at\n\nboth study sites were noticeably lower than those reported by other studies involving repeat RSE\u2019s, i.e.\n\nin Australia and western Spain.

Introduction\n\nAs thoroughly discussed by Shakesby and Doerr (2006),\nthrough their effects on soil properties as well as on vegetation\nand litter cover, wildfires can lead to considerable changes in\ngeomorphologic and hydrological processes. Previous studies in\nvarious parts of the world, including Portugal (e.g. Shakesby et al.,\n1993, 1996; Walsh et al., 1992, 1995; Ferreira et al., 2005b, 2008),\nhave revealed strong and sometimes extreme responses in runoff\ngeneration and associated soil losses following wildfire, especially\nduring the earlier stages of the so-called \u2018\u2018window-of-distur-\nbance\u2019\u2019. Besides wildfire itself, post-fire forestry practices can\n\nstrongly influence overland flow and erosion in recently burnt\nareas (e.g. Shakesby et al., 1994; Walsh et al., 1995; Ferna?ndez\net al., 2007). For example, rip-ploughing during the window-of-\ndisturbance was far more damaging in terms of soil loss than fire\n(Shakesby et al., 1994).\n\nThe need for a model-based tool for assessing erosion risk\nfollowing wildfire and, ultimately, for guiding post-fire land\nmanagement, like the Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) for\nthe Western USA (Robichaud et al., 2007), is overtly evident in the\ncase of Portugal. Over the past decades, wildfires in Portugal have\ndevastated on average around 100.000 ha each year, with\ndramatically higher figures for dry years like 2003 and 2005\n(Pereira et al., 2005). Furthermore, the frequency of wildfires in\nPortugal is expected to remain the same or to increase in the\nfuture (Pereira et al., 2006). In relation to fire occurrence, the\nwidespread introduction of commercial eucalypt plantations\n(principally of Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) in central Portugal\n(including in the study area) in combination with their proneness\nto fire deserves special reference. Furthermore, post-fire erosion\nrisk is expectedly higher in eucalypt stands than, for example,\n\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\n\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/envres\n\nEnvironmental Research\n\n0013-9351/$ - see front matter &amp; 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Field rainfall simulation\nexperiments (RSE\u2019s) were selected as principal method for\ngathering the data required for initial calibration of the process-\nbased model MEFIDIS (Nunes et al., 2005) for post-fire conditions,\nmuch along the lines of the approach applied in Nunes et al.\n(2009a, 2009b). In spite of the well-know limitations of RSE\u2019s in\nterms of reproducing natural rainfall events and emulating runoff/\nerosion processes beyond small spatial scales (e.g. Rickson, 2001),\nthey have been widely used for studying hydrological and erosion\nprocesses in recently burnt woodland areas, especially at spatial\nscales of 1 m2 and less (e.g. Imeson et al., 1992; Kutiel et al., 1995;\nSevink et al., 1989; Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2001;\nJohansen et al., 2001; Cerd?a and Doerr, 2005; Coelho et al., 2005;\nFerreira et al., 2005a; Rulli et al., 2006; Leighton-Boyce et al.,\n2007; Sheridan et al., 2007). However, the bulk of these studies\nconcerned singular moments in time-after-fire, not addressing for\nexample the seasonal component in post-fire runoff and erosion\nthat is often observed in longer-term plot monitoring studies\nunder natural rainfall conditions (e.g. Shakesby et al., 1993, 1994).\nAlso, the individual studies generally involved a single rainfall\nintensity. As far Portugal is concerned, surprisingly few field RSE\nstudies have been carried out in recently wildfire-burnt stands of\neucalypt (Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007) or, for that matter, in other\nprevailing forest types (Walsh et al., 1998; Coelho et al., 2004;\nFerreira et al., 2005a).\n\nThe main aim of the present work was to explore repeated\nfield campaigns of RSE\u2019s for a better knowledge and under-\nstanding of overland flow generation and associated sediment\nlosses in recently burnt commercial eucalypt plantations. To this\nend, RSE\u2019s were carried out in two eucalypt stands on four\noccasions during the first year following wildfire and on two\nadditional occasions during the second year. Two adjacent sites\nwere selected for expectedly representing contrasting risks of\npost-fire erosion, with the site that had been rip-ploughed\npresenting a greater risk than the neighbouring unploughed site.\n\nThe specific objectives were to determine how overland flow\ngeneration and sediment losses varied at the micro-plot scale\nwith (i) high vs. extreme simulated rainfall intensity (45\u201350 and\n80\u201385 mm h?1); (ii) time since fire and associated changes in\ninitial conditions, in particular soil water repellency; (iii) within-\nand between-site characteristics at a ploughed vs. unploughed\nslope.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Study area and sites\n\nThe present study was carried out in two adjacent commercial eucalypt\n\n(Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) plantations in the Ac-ores locality of the Albergaria-a-\n\nVelha municipality of north-central Portugal (Fig. 1). The two study sites were\n\nlocated at approximately 401420N, 81290W and 60\u201370 m elevation, and comprised\n\nsteep but short slopes bounded by paths (Table 1).\n\nThe study sites burned during early July 2005 in a wildfire that affected a total\n\narea of about 16 km2, which was largely covered by eucalypt plantations. The\n\ncomplete consumption of the litter and herb cover, together with the partial\n\nconsumption of the shrub layer and tree crowns, suggested that fire severity at\n\nboth sites had been moderate (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Table 1). Judging by\n\nremaining tree stumps, the two sites had undergone at least two eucalypt\n\n(re)growth cycles prior to the fire. The two sites were selected for their contrasting\n\nland management practices and, as mentioned above, expectedly distinct risks of\n\npost-fire soil erosion. At the unploughed Ac-ores1 site, trees had been planted\n\nwithout apparent evidence of mechanical ground operations, resulting in an\n\nundisturbed soil profile. At the ploughed Ac-ores2 site, a clear pattern of shallow\n\nridges and furrows (up to 20 cm high) running down the slope was present. Rip-\n\nploughing (i.e. mechanical ploughing using a ripper with one to three teeth that\n\nrupture the upper soil horizons in a vertical plane without altering their\n\ndisposition) in preparation for planting is a common practice in this region and,\n\njudging by the stand age, would have taken place around 5 years prior to the fire.\n\nThe study area is situated at the transition of the region\u2019s two major\n\nphysiographic units, the Littoral Platform dominated by Ceno-Mesozoic deposits\n\nand the Hesperic Massif dominated by pre-Ordovician schists and greywackes and\n\nHercynian granites (Ferreira, 1978; Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995). The soils are\n\nmapped \u2013 at a scale of 1:1,000,000 \u2013 as a complex of Humic Cambisols and, to a\n\nlesser extent, Dystric Litosols (Cardoso et al., 1971, 1973). At both the study sites,\n\ntwo soil profiles were excavated in the middle and at the bottom of the study\n\nslopes. The soils corresponded to Umbric or Dystric Leptosols (FAO, 1988),\n\ndepending on the depth of their A horizons. They were shallow (5\u201340 cm depth)\n\nsoils developed over schists and had sandy loam textures and high organic matter\n\ncontents (8.8\u201310.4%). These soil characteristics differed little between the two\n\nsites, which also agreed with the fact that rip-ploughing supposedly does not alter\n\nthe disposition of the soil layers. Even so, the observed soil differences were duly\n\nconsidered in the discussion of the RSE results.\n\nThe climate of the study area can be characterised as humid meso-thermal,\n\nwith a prolonged dry and warm summer (Ko?ppen Csb) DRA-Centro (1998). Fig. 1\n\nshows the locations of the study sites as well as of the nearest climate station\n\n(Estarreja: 401470N, 81350W, 26 m; 17.5 km distance) and the nearest rainfall\n\nstation (Albergaria-a-Velha: 401420N, 81290W, 131 m; 4 km distance). The long-\n\nterm mean annual temperature at the Estarreja station is 13.9 1C and the mean\n\nmonthly temperatures range from 8.8 1C in December to 19.1 1C in July (DRA-\n\nCentro, 1998). The annual rainfall at the Albergaria-a-Velha station is, on average,\n\n1229 mm and varies between 750 and 2022 mm (DRA-Centro, 1998). Fig. 1 also\n\ndepicts the stations\u2019 seasonal variations in average monthly temperature and\n\nrainfall, and the monthly rainfall amounts at the study sites during the first year\n\nfollowing wildfire. These latter data were obtained with a tipping-bucket rainfall\n\ngauge (Pronamic Professional Rain Gauge) linked to a Hobo Event Logger of Onset\n\nComputer Corporation, and were verified using the data from two totaliser rainfall\n\ngauges. All three gauges were installed at the foot of the study sites on September\n\n24, 2005. These data were used in this paper to calculate the antecedent daily\n\nrainfall for the different field sampling days.\n\n2.2. Rainfall simulation experiments\n\nBetween September 2005 and July 2007, a total of 46 rainfall simulation\n\nexperiments (RSE\u2019s) were carried out in the field using two portable simulators as\n\noriginally designed by Calvo et al. (1988) and later improved by Cerd?a et al. (1997).\n\nOne simulator was equipped with the original nozzle and was calibrated in the\n\nlaboratory to produce artificial rain with an intensity of approximately 45 mm h?1.\n\nThe second simulator was equipped with a modified nozzle, using cone nozzle\n\nHARDI-1553-14 instead of HARDI-1553-10, to produce intensities of around\n\n80 mm h?1. The former intensity is comparable to the maximum hourly rainfall\n\nfor a 100-year return period of the Aveiro rainfall station (Brand~ao et al., 2001). The\n\nlatter is similar to the maximum hourly rainfall ever recorded in Portugal (Brand~ao\n\net al., 2001) but a prior RSE study in Portuguese eucalypt forests like Leighton-Boyce\n\net al. (2007) applied still higher intensities (100 mm h?1) and found infiltration\n\ncapacities exceeding this value. Hereafter, the two intensities will be referred\n\nto as \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018extreme\u2019\u2019, respectively. Other modifications to the original\n\nsimulator design involved the use of a battery-driven pump system with pressure\n\nvat and of an approximately square plot (consisting of a square area of\n\n0.50 m?0.50 m and an outlet area of 0.03 m2), both of which were introduced by\n\nDe Alba (1997).\n\nThe 46 RSE\u2019s were carried out during four separate field campaigns in the first\n\nyear after the wildfire, and two more campaigns in the second year (Table 2).\n\nBefore every campaign (with the exception of the second) the two standard and\n\ntwo spare nozzles were (re-)calibrated in the laboratory. Each campaign involved\n\nfour RSE\u2019s on both the ploughed and unploughed site, except in the case of the\n\nOctober 2006 campaign when only the high-intensity RSE\u2019s were carried out at the\n\nunploughed site due to failure of the extreme-intensity pump system. The four\n\nRSE\u2019s at a particular site were in general performed on the same day and within\n\nless than a week of those carried out at the other study site. Exceptions were the\n\nfirst campaign on the ploughed site and the October 2006 campaign, which took\n\nplace on September 20 and 22, 2005, and October 12 and 31, 2006, respectively.\n\nThe four RSE\u2019s at each site and date were carried out using a pair-wise\n\nsampling design. High- and extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s were run almost\n\nM.C. Malvar et al. / Environmental Research 111 (2011) 222\u2013236 223\n\n\n\nsimultaneously on two neighbouring plots located at about the same elevation on\n\nthe slope but separated across the slope by 3\u20135 m. The two pairs of neighbouring\n\nplots on each site were placed randomly by installing them halfway the slope\u2019s\n\nupper and lower half. This was done in a horizontal section of the slope that was\n\nspecifically reserved for the RSE\u2019s. The slope was further divided in a section that\n\nwas equipped with erosion plots and a section that was used to describe topsoil\n\ncharacteristics at regular intervals (see Keizer et al., 2008). According to their\n\nspatial lay-out, the RSE-plots at each site were designated as follows: 1 and 2 were\n\nlocated on upper slope sections, 3 and 4 on the lower slope sections; 1 and 3\n\nconcerned high-intensity RSE\u2019s, 2 and 4 extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s. The prefixes \u2018\u2018U\u2019\u2019\n\nand \u2018\u2018P\u2019\u2019 were used to indicate the plots on the unploughed and ploughed site,\n\nrespectively.\n\nThe RSE\u2019s of the first campaign were immediately followed by destructive\n\nsampling of the plots as soon as the runoff had stopped. The RSE\u2019s of the second\n\nand subsequent campaigns, however, were carried out on permanent plots, with\n\nthe repeat experiments on each plot involving the same intensity as established\n\nrandomly in October 2006. Each pair of RSE\u2019s involved a third \u2018\u2018control\u2019\u2019 plot for\n\ndestructive measurements and sampling of the initial conditions, in particular\n\nVouga river basin\n\nAveiro \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nEstarreja meteorological station\n(1956-1977; temperature in \u00b0C)\n\nAlbergaria-a-Velha rainfall station\n(1941-1991; rainfall in mm)\n\nA\u00e7ores study sites \n\n(October 2005 \u2013 July 2006; rainfall in mm) \n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n\nFig. 1.

Non-\n\ndestructive characterisation of the RSE-plots was done prior to all experiments and\n\ninvolved a standard procedure of quantifying the frequency of various cover\n\nclasses by recording their presence/absence in the 5 cm?5 cm cells of a\n\n50 cm?60 cm grid laid out over the plots. Photographs were taken and used to\n\ncheck the frequency estimates and convert them into decimal cover classes from\n\n0 to 10.\n\nThe destructive sampling of the initial RSE-plots and control plots concerned\n\nfirst and foremost the moisture content and water repellency of the topsoil at 2\u20133\n\nand 7\u20138 cm depth. This involved the same methods, equipment and water\n\nrepellency severity ratings as described in Keizer et al. (2008). In a nutshell, soil\n\nmoisture content was measured using an ML2 ThetaProbeTM connected to a HH2\n\nThetaMeter (Delta T-Devices Ltd.) or, in case of probe failure, gravimetrically and\n\nthen converted based on Saxton et al. (1986) and Costa (1999). Water repellency\n\nseverity was measured using the \u2018Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet\u2019 (MED) test (e.g.\n\nKing, 1981; Doerr, 1998), by applying three droplets of increasing ethanol\n\nconcentration and employing their median ethanol concentration (%vol) as test\n\nresult. The following nine ethanol classes and corresponding ethanol concentra-\n\ntions were used: 0\u20130%; 1\u20131%; 2\u20133%; 3\u20135%; 4\u20138.5%; 5\u201313%; 6\u201318%; 7\u201324%;\n\n8\u2013Z36%. Random roughness was determined using a pin profile metre and the\n\nPMPPROJ software (developed by J. Kilpelainen, Agricultural Research Centre,\n\nJokioinen, Finland) for processing the photographs.\n\nAll RSE\u2019s were carried out using a pre-established protocol and standard field\n\nforms that were derived, with some modifications, from those employed in the\n\nMEDAFOR project (Shakesby et al., 2002). The protocol\u2019s principal elements were\n\nthe application of artificial rain from a height of 2 m during 1 h, runoff\n\nmeasurements at 1-min intervals and the collection of up to five runoff samples\n\n(i.e. one from the start of the runoff till its approximate stabilisation; one from the\n\nend of the rainfall till the end of the runoff; three at the start, middle and end of\n\nthe remaining period). The collected runoff samples were later analysed in the\n\nlaboratory for their sediment and organic matter loads using the classical\n\nevaporation protocol (APHA, 1998) and loss-on-ignition at 550 1C. Soil texture\n\nclasses were determined by the Soil Laboratory of the Coimbra Higher School of\n\nAgriculture, using a combination of mechanical sieving and the pipette method.\n\n2.3. Data analysis\n\nData analysis was carried out using STATISTICA for Windows Version 9.0, by\n\nStatSoft Inc. Rank-based descriptive statistics and non-parametric statistical tests\n\nwere preferred, in particular because of the limited number of samples and the\n\nresulting difficulties in verifying key assumptions underlying the parametric\n\nequivalents. The Mann-Whitney U-test and the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test were\n\nemployed to test overall differences, whereas the Wilcoxon\u2019s signed-ranks test\n\nand the Friedman test were used to assess differences in paired observations,\n\neither neighbouring plots or repeat-RSE\u2019s on the permanent plots. Besides\n\ndifferences between individual RSE\u2019s, also differences in average values of\n\nconcurrent high-/extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s were included in the analyses for being\n\nless susceptible to possible noise due to spatial variability. In the case of the\n\ntemporal patterns, only differences between consecutive campaigns were tested.\n\nThis was done to restrict the number of multiple, unplanned comparisons to a\n\nminimum. Also the significance of the between-site differences of the individual\n\nRSE\u2019s was assessed using the standard type I error a\u00bc0.05 and not using the\ncomparison-wise type I error a0\u00bc0.025 following the Dunn\u2013S?ida?k method for 2\nunplanned comparisons (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981).\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\n3.1. Overall runoff and erosion rates\n\nTable 2 summarises the overall runoff and erosion figures\nobtained over the six field campaigns between September 2005\nand July 2007. Direct comparison of the presented values is\nhampered by the lack of extreme-intensity data at the un-\nploughed site for the October 2006 campaign. Nonetheless, the\nmain differences observable in Table 2 are similar to those for the\nfive common campaigns (explained below).\n\nThe two simulated rainfall intensities had a negligible effect on\nthe relative amounts of overland flow generation at the two study\nsites; runoff coefficients were rather determined by site-specific\ndifferences. For the five \u2018\u2018common\u2019\u2019 periods, the overall runoff\ncoefficients amounted to 57\u201358% and 38\u201339% for the unploughed\nand ploughed site, respectively. In terms of absolute runoff\namounts, the extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s at each site therefore\nproduced, on average, about 70% more overland flow than the\nhigh-intensity RSE\u2019s on the same site. The extreme-intensity\nvalues for the five \u2018\u2018common\u2019\u2019 campaigns were 231 and 154 mm\nfor the unploughed and ploughed site, respectively; the corre-\nsponding high-intensity values were 133 and 91 mm.\n\nTotal losses of soil and organic matter were determined by a\ncombined effect of site-specific factors and rainfall intensity. The\nlosses at the unploughed site exceeded those at the ploughed site.\nFor the five \u2018\u2018common\u2019\u2019 campaigns, the total soil losses were 25\nand 89 g m?2 vs. 14 and 21 g m?2, respectively, and the\ncorresponding total organic matter losses were 18 and 56 g m?2\n\nvs. 10 and 14 g m?2. The between-site differences for the separate\nrainfall intensities were more pronounced. The losses at the\nunploughed site were almost twice as high in the case of the high-\nintensity RSE\u2019s and more than four times as high in the case of the\nextreme-intensity RSE\u2019s. The intensity-related differences in total\nlosses were bigger at the unploughed than ploughed site. The\nextreme-intensity RSE\u2019s produced, on average, roughly three\ntimes more soil and organic matter loss than the high-intensity\nRSE\u2019s at the unploughed site but only 40\u201350% higher losses at the\nploughed site.\n\nThe intensity-related differences in total soil and organic\nmatter losses can in the case of the unploughed site be partly\nattributed to higher specific losses. The specific losses were about\ntwice as high for the extreme- than high-intensity RSE\u2019s. By\ncontrast, at the ploughed site the specific losses were basically the\nsame for the two intensities. The contribution of the specific\nlosses to the between-site differences was also not consistent.\nThey were of minor influence in the case of the high-intensity\n\nTable 1\nGeneral terrain characteristics and fire severity indicators at an unploughed and a\n\nploughed eucalypt site.\n\nVariable Unploughed Ploughed\n\nPhysiognomy\nSlope section length (m) 20\u201325 30\u201340\n\nSlope angle (deg.) 20 15\n\nAspect SE NE\n\nFire severity indicators\nEucalypt crown damage Partial Partial\n\nHeight of eucalypt stem scorching (m) r9 r12\nCombustion of litter/herbs layer Total Total\n\nCombustion shrub layer Partial Partial\n\nAsh colour Black Black\n\nTable 2\nOverview of high- and extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s (n? intensity in mm h?1) and their\n\naverage runoff and erosion results at an unploughed and a ploughed eucalypt\n\nstand during the first 2 years following a wildfire.\n\nCampaign Period Unploughed Ploughed\n\nHigh Extreme High Extreme\n\n1 20\u201322\u201327/09/2005 2?46 2?84 2?46 2?84\n\n2 10\u201315/11/2005 2?46 2?84 2?46 2?84\n\n3 30/03\u201304/04/2006 2?48 2?80 2?48 2?80\n\n4 20\u201325/07/2006 2?46 2?80 2?46 2?80\n\n5 12\u201331/10/2006 2?47 2?81 2?47 \u2013\n\n6 03\u201309/07/2007 2?44 2?76 2?44 2?76\n\nVariables\nSlope angle permanent plots (deg.) 23 23 17 17\n\nTotal simulated rainfall (mm) 277 485 277 404\n\nTotal runoff (mm) 150 265 94 154\n\nOverall runoff coefficient (%) 54 55 34 38\n\nTotal soil loss (g m?2) 26 93 14 21\n\nTotal organic matter loss (g m?2) 18 57 10 14\n\nSpecific soil loss (g m?2 mm?1 runoff) 0.17 0.35 0.15 0.15\n\nSpecific o.m. loss (g m?2 mm?1 runoff) 0.12 0.21 0.11 0.09\n\nM.C.

In a nearby area, down\nslope rip-ploughing was found to substantially enhance overland\nflow responses and sediment loss rates during the first three years\nafter ploughing (Shakesby et al., 1994; Walsh et al., 1995). These\nresults are not directly comparable to those presented here,\nnamely, they concerned much bigger plots (16 m2) and lower,\nnatural rainfall intensities. Even so, the overall sediment loss rates\nof the high-intensity RSE\u2019s of this study (0.09\u20130.16 g m?2 mm?1\n\nrainfall) were much more similar to those reported by Shakesby\net al. (1994) for \u2018\u2018natural recovery\u2019\u2019 post-burn sites (0.05\u20130.10 g\nm?2 mm?1 rainfall) than for a recently rip-ploughed site do\n(3.27 g m?2 mm?1 rainfall; see also Terry (1996)).\n\nThe lower-than-expected sediment losses at the ploughed site\ncould be related to the fact that ploughing took place several years\nbefore the wildfire. Shakesby et al. (1994) estimated that sediment\nlosses decline rapidly following rip-ploughing. They attributed this\nto the formation of a protective stone lag, particularly in the early\nstages, and to the subsequent development of vegetation and litter\ncover. There was, however, no evidence that surface stone cover in\nthe RSE-plots was noticeably higher at the ploughed than\nunploughed site. Walsh et al. (1995) further suggested that rip-\nploughing ultimately decreased soil erodibility through selective\nremoval of the fine soil fraction by initial erosion events. This fits in\nwith the lower specific soil losses at the ploughed than unploughed\nsite, especially in the case of the extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s. The topsoil\n(0\u20135 cm) at the ploughed site has, in fact, somewhat smaller clay\nand loam fractions than that at the unploughed site (median values\nof 3 samples: 7 and 20 vs. 13% and 24%, respectively). Nonetheless,\nthe lower specific soil losses at the ploughed site could also be due\nto its smaller runoff amounts as well as to the expectedly lower flow\nvelocities due to its less steep slope angle. Between-site differences\nare further analysed below.\n\nThe overall runoff and erosion values are not easily compared with\nthose from literature, namely, the bulk of the field RSE studies\nfollowing recent forest wildfires concerned singular moments in time\n(e.g. Sevink et al., 1989; Kutiel et al., 1995; Benavides-Solorio and\nMacDonald, 2001; Johansen et al., 2001; Rulli et al., 2006). Focusing\non Portugal, only Leighton-Boyce et al. (2007) seem to have carried\nout RSE\u2019s in a recently burnt eucalypt plantation as well. In terms of\nrainfall intensity (100 mm h?1) and pre-fire ploughing, their RSE\u2019s\ncompare best with the extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s at the ploughed site.\nCompared with these RSE\u2019s, both the mean runoff coefficient and\nmean specific sediment loss of Leighton-Boyce et al. (2007) were\nroughly twice as high (70% and 0.90 g m?2 mm?1 runoff).\n\nRSE data are also scarce for recently burnt stands of another\ncommon and fire-prone forest type in Portugal, that of Maritime\nPine. Using basically the same experimental set-up as here,\n\nCoelho et al. (2004) and Ferreira et al. (2005a) found runoff\ncoefficients of 55\u201365%, which is comparable to the overall figure\nfor the high-intensity RSE\u2019s at the unploughed site. The specific\nsediment losses in Coelho et al. (2004), however, were 3\u20134 times\nhigher (0.90\u20131.20 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) than the corresponding\nvalues of the present study. Walsh et al. (1998) reported lower\nrunoff coefficients (19\u201325%) but this was 2 years after a wildfire\nand involved lower application rates (33\u201335 mm h?1) as well as\nlarger plots (1 m2).\n\nOutside Portugal, wildfire-affected eucalypt stands were stu-\ndied in a particularly exhaustive manner in Australia by Sheridan\net al. (2007). This included eight subsequent campaigns of field\nRSE\u2019s but, unlike in this study, using different plots during each\ncampaign. With rainfall intensities of 100 mm h?1 applied (during\n30 min) on unploughed soils, these RSE\u2019s are best compared with\nthe extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s at the unploughed site. Over the first\n2 years after fire, Sheridan et al. (2007) found a somewhat lower\nrunoff coefficient (41%) than reported here but an almost six times\nhigher specific sediment loss (3.26 g m?2 mm?1 runoff), possibly\nreflecting their larger plot size (3 m2).\n\nOrganic matter constituted an important fraction of the\nsediment losses observed in the present study. It amounted, on\naverage, to some 40% and varied little between the two sites and\nthe two intensities (38\u201342%). This is held to reflect the export of\nlitter and especially ash particles, since the organic matter content\nof the 0\u20135 cm topsoil at both sites was only some 10%\n(unploughed site\u00bc10.3%; ploughed site\u00bc9.0%; median value of\nthree samples). Unfortunately, comparison with the other studies\ncited in this section is not possible, since they do not present\nseparate data on organic matter losses.\n\n3.2. Variation with rainfall intensity\n\nOverall differences between the high- and extreme-intensity\nRSE\u2019s tended not to be statistically significant (Table 3). The\nabsolute runoff amounts constituted an exception, with signifi-\ncant differences in three of the four tests. The extreme-intensity\nRSE\u2019s only did not produce significantly more runoff than the\nhigh-intensity RSE\u2019s in the case of the ploughed site. This can be\nattributed to a greater spatio-temporal variability in the site\u2019s\nhydrological response, namely, the difference in median runoff\namounts is of the same of order of magnitude for the ploughed\nsite as for the unploughed site (approximately 20 vs. 25 mm).\n\nThe effect of rainfall intensity was more apparent from the\nWilcoxon\u2019s Test results, i.e. when eliminating the variability due\nto differences between the campaigns as well as between the plot\npairs. Besides runoff amounts, total soil and organic matter losses\nrevealed statistically significant differences. The significance of\nthese differences and their sign can be perceived from Fig. 2. Thus,\nextreme-intensity RSE\u2019s tended to produce significantly stronger\n\nTable 3\nStatistical comparison of runoff and erosion by high- vs. extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s at an unploughed and a ploughed eucalypt stand. The comparison concerns the two study\n\nsites together (\u2018\u2018U&amp;P\u2019\u2019) as well as separately, and the site-wise average values (\u2018\u2018mean\u2019\u2019) as well as the values of the individual RSE-pairs (\u2018\u2018Indiv.\u2019\u2019).

This especially applied\nto (i) absolute as opposed to relative measures; (ii) the two sites\ntogether and the unploughed site alone as opposed to the\nploughed site alone. The runoff values at the ploughed site\nrevealed a suspicious pattern in Fig. 2, with an equal number of\npoints situated above and below the 1:1 line. Therefore, the\nWilcoxon\u2019s tests were also applied to the site\u2019s separate plot pairs,\neven though the numbers of paired observations are small (n\u00bc5).\nFor both plot pairs total runoff was significantly different.\nHowever, whilst total runoff was significantly higher for the\nextreme- than high-intensity RSE\u2019s in one case (plots P1 and P2 on\n\nthe upper section of the slope), it was significantly lower in the\nother case (plots P3 and P4). In the case of the former plot pair, the\nextreme-intensity RSE\u2019s also produced significantly higher total\nsoil and organic matter losses.\n\nThe deviant behaviour of especially one of the plot pairs on the\nploughed site could be related to the pre-fire ploughing, leading to\nmore heterogeneous micro-topographic and topsoil conditions in\ncomparison to the undisturbed soil profiles of the neighbouring\nsite. This could involve a combination of factors rather than a\nsingle factor per se. For example, the slope angle of the high-\nintensity plot on the lower slope section (P3: 201) was slightly\nsteeper than that of the adjacent extreme-intensity plot (P4: 181)\n\nFig. 2. Runoff and soil and organic matter losses of neighbouring pairs of high- and extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s at an unploughed (diamonds) and a ploughed (squares)\neucalypt site.\n\nM.C.

Also, spatial variability in topsoil water\nrepellency (0\u20135 cm) during the first year following the wildfire\ntended to be more pronounced in the case of the ploughed than\nunploughed site (Keizer et al., 2008). Litter cover could play a role\nas well, since the P4 plot had a much higher litter cover than the\nP3 plot from the second campaign onwards (Fig. 6). This was due\nto the fall of leaves from scorched eucalypt crowns, which then\nslowly decomposed in situ. Shakesby et al. (1994) also mentioned\nthis phenomenon in burnt eucalypt stands but expected its role in\nlimiting erosion to be short lived. The role of such a litter cover\ncould be direct \u2013 through interception storage and protection\nagainst rain drop impact \u2013 or indirect \u2013 by increasing the\nresistance to overland flow and/or by changing soil moisture as\nwell as water repellency (e.g. Imeson et al., 1992; Lavee et al.,\n1995; Walsh et al., 1998; Doerr et al., 2000; Pannkuk and\nRoubichaud, 2003; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007).\n\n3.3. Temporal patterns\n\nThe timing of the RSE\u2019s had a significant influence on runoff\nresponse in general (Table 4). Overland flow generation varied\nsignificantly between the five and six campaigns: (i) in absolute as\nwell as relative amounts; (ii) equally so for the average and\nindividual values of the two sites together as for the values of the\nploughed and unploughed site separately; (iii) in terms of both plot-\nspecific and overall differences. The same applied to the total soil\nand organic matter losses. In the case of the specific losses, however,\nonly the individual values of the two sites together and of the\nploughed site separately varied significantly with time-since-fire.\n\nComparison of the consecutive campaigns revealed that sig-\nnificant changes in hydrological and erosion processes principally\noccurred between campaigns 2 (November 2005) and 3 (March/\nApril 2006) as well as between campaigns 5 (October 2006) and 6\n(July 2007) (Table 4). These last two campaigns differed significantly\nfor all the variables studied here. Total runoff stood out amongst the\nvarious variables in that the differences between campaigns 2 and 3\nas well as between campaigns 5 and 6 were only statistically\nsignificant on a plot-wise basis and not also in general. This probably\nreflected the significant differences in runoff amounts between the\n\nextreme- and high-intensity RSE\u2019s (see Table 3), adding to campaign-\nwise variability.\n\nIn close agreement with the above-mentioned statistical\nresults, the temporal variation in runoff and erosion revealed\ntwo distinctive patterns (Fig. 3). First, the median values were\nclearly higher for the first two and the last campaigns than for the\nthird to fifth campaigns. Second, median values of the first five\ncampaigns were noticeably lower than that of the last campaign.\nThe first pattern applied to the absolute and relative runoff\namounts as well as to the absolute sediment losses, whilst the\nsecond pattern concerned the relative sediment losses. A\nconsistent element in the first pattern was further that the\nmedian value of the fourth campaign (July 2006) was lower than\nthose of the third and fifth campaigns).\n\nThe temporal patterns in soil water repellency and other\npotential explanatory variables are shown in Fig. 4. The significant\ndecrease in overland flow and total sediment losses between 4 and 9\nmonths after the wildfire agreed well with a pronounced drop-off at\nboth sites in topsoil water repellency from extremely hydrophobic\nto hydrophilic. The significant increase in runoff and erosion\nbetween 16 and 24 months after the wildfire, however, was less\nconsistent with differences in repellency. Whilst at the ploughed site\nmedian ethanol classes were higher in July 2007 than October 2006,\nat the unploughed site they were basically the same. The limited\nhydrological impact of the very strong repellency of the unploughed\nsoil in October 2006 could be due to the antecedent rainfall (10 mm\nin the two preceding days), enhancing the spatial variability in\nrepellency and, thereby, opportunities for re-infiltration of overland\nflow (e.g. Shakesby et al., 2000; Keizer et al., 2005a).\n\nThe results of the summer 2006 campaign also casted doubt on\nthe role of soil water repellency, with the ploughed site\npresenting the most puzzling case. All four RSE\u2019s at this site then\nproduced the least runoff, even though repellency was equally\nstrong as during the first two campaigns and also rather\nhomogeneous (range of ethanol classes: 6\u20138; n\u00bc10). In the case\nof the unploughed site, the reduced runoff production in July 2007\ncould be due to the moderate median repellency level as opposed\nto the very strong/extreme level during fall 2005 and summer\n2007. The discrepancy in water repellency between the un-\nploughed and ploughed site during the July 2006 campaign can be\nexplained by the 15 mm of rainfall that fell on July 19, 2006,\n\nTable 4\nStatistical comparison of runoff and erosion for various RSE campaigns together as well as for consecutive RSE campaigns. The overall comparison concerned the two sites\n\ntogether (\u2018\u2018U&amp;P\u2019\u2019) as well as separately, and the site-wise average values (\u2018\u2018mean\u2019\u2019) as well as the values of the individual RSE-pairs (\u2018\u2018Indiv.\u2019\u2019).

Recovery of the ground vegetation was in fact\nlimited during these 2 years following the wildfire (Fig. 4). By July\n2006, vegetation cover was less than 20% in seven out of eight\n\nplots; by July 2007, it was less than 40% in all except the two plots\ndepicted in Fig. 4. Shakesby et al. (1994) also indicated that\nground vegetation in eucalypt stands recovered too slowly after\n\nFig. 4.

The possible role of\nvegetation cover at the scale of individual plots is addressed next.\n\nThe RSE\u2019s by Sheridan et al. (2007) revealed a better overall\nagreement between the temporal patterns in runoff coefficient and\nsoil water repellency than found here. Their highest runoff values\nwere not restricted to the first few months after the wildfire but also\noccurred some 3 years later. Even so, differences in runoff could not\nbe entirely attributed to water repellency, in particular the almost\ntwice as high runoff coefficient 3 years compared to 1 month after\nfire under equally strongly repellent conditions. Clearly distinct from\nthe current results was Sheridan\u2019s et al. (2007) finding of markedly\nhigher sediment concentrations during the first year after fire. Such\na decrease suggests a transition from transport- to sediment-limited\nconditions, as is also commonly observed in post-fire erosion plot\nstudies under natural rainfall (see Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). Their\nspecific sediment losses during the first post-fire year (2.26\u2013\n7.19 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) clearly exceeded the present values. Their\nvalues for the subsequent 2 years (0.13\u20131.59 g m?2 mm?1 runoff),\nhowever, were comparable.\n\nThe only other study involving a time series of RSE\u2019s in wildfire-\naffected forests is that of Cerd?a and Doerr (2005) in Aleppo Pine\nstands in eastern Spain. They employed the same simulator as in this\nstudy (application rate of 55 mm h?1) and also permanent plots.\nDuring the first 3 years following fire, their RSE\u2019s produced higher\nrunoff coefficients under wet than under dry conditions. This\ncontrasting hydrological response could be explained by the low\nwater repellency levels during this initial post-fire period, likely as a\ndirect effect of fire. The erosion results of Cerd?a and Doerr (2005)\nwere also distinct from the present ones. The specific sediment\nlosses dropped sharply from the first to the second year after fire\nand then more gradually afterwards. Only from the sixth year\nonwards the specific losses in Cerd?a and Doerr (2005) fell below\n0.40 g m?2 mm?1 runoff, thus becoming comparable to the bulk of\nthe high-intensity values presented here. Their values for the first\npost-fire year (2.50\u20135.25 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) were not widely\ndifferent from Sheridan\u2019s et al. (2007) above-mentioned figures for\nthe first post-fire year, even though application rate and plot size\nwere much smaller (55 vs. 100 mm h?1; 0.25 vs. 3 m2).\n\n3.4. Spatial variability\n\nWithin-site differences. Overall differences between the same-\nintensity plots were not significant for any of the sites or variables\n(Table 5). This can be attributed to the above-mentioned,\nsignificant temporal variability between the various RSE cam-\npaigns. Campaign-specific differences, on the other hand, were\nsignificant in various instances, all of which involving extreme-\nintensity plots. The latter suggested that extreme events en-\nhanced the inherent spatial variability in plot characteristics and,\nconsequently, erosion processes. These significant differences,\nhowever, had different origins at the two sites. In the case of the\nploughed site, the runoff response of the two extreme-intensity\nplots differed widely (Fig. 5). In turn, this discrepancy in runoff\ncaused significant different total soil and organic matter losses,\nsince the specific losses differed in the opposite sense. In the case\nof the unploughed site, by contrast, significant differences in\nspecific soil losses contributed markedly to the significant\ndifferences in total soil losses.\n\nAs discussed before, the significantly lower amount of over-\nland flow generated at one of the extreme-intensity plots at the\nploughed site (plot P4) could be explained by its high litter cover\n(Fig. 6), possibly in combination with other factors. The sig-\nnificantly higher specific soil losses at plot U4 at the unploughed\nsite were more difficult to explain, also because plot-specific data\nrelated to soil erodibility were not available. Post-fire vegetation\nrecovery could play a role, since it was basically lacking at plot U4\nbut pronounced at plot U2 (Fig. 6). It would especially help\nexplain why the plots\u2019 specific losses differed considerably less in\nJuly 2007 than in November 2005 (with a factor 3 and 6,\nrespectively).\n\nIn particular during the campaigns of November 2005 and July\n2007, the specific sediment losses recorded at plot U4 stood out\namongst the present values. Compared to other studies, however,\nthese values (1.7 and 1.1 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) were hardly\nsuspicious. Leighton-Boyce et al.

Malvar et al. / Environmental Research 111 (2011) 222\u2013236232\n\n\n\nThe credibility of the relatively high losses at plot U4 was\nfurther corroborated by the strong increase in the plot\u2019s stone\ncover (Fig. 6). It remained unclear, however, if this stone lag\nalready existed before the wildfire, becoming increasingly\nexposed by the subsequent removal of the ash layer and the lack\nof vegetation recovery, or whether it developed during the study\nperiod. The former explanation is perhaps most likely, namely,\nShakesby et al. (1993) and Terry (1996) reported a much higher\nspecific sediment loss (11.9 g m?2 mm?1 runoff) for the initial\nphase of stone lag formation in an eucalypt stand.\n\nBetween-site differences. The unploughed site revealed a\nsignificantly stronger average runoff response than the ploughed\nsite (Table 5). This was true for both the absolute and relative\nrunoff amounts and for both the high- and extreme-intensity\nRSE\u2019s, as is also easily perceived from Fig. 7. By contrast,\nsignificant differences in average sediment losses were restricted\nto the total soil and organic matter losses of the extreme-intensity\nRSE\u2019s, again with the values at the unploughed site being highest.\nNonetheless, also the high-intensity RSE\u2019s revealed some ten-\ndency towards higher average soil losses at the unploughed site,\nnamely, the values at the unploughed site were highest in five out\nof the six RSE campaigns.\n\nAlthough the Wilcoxon\u2019s test results for the individual plots\nwere indicative only, they allowed further insight in the average\nbetween-site differences (Table 5). This especially applied to the\nextreme-intensity RSE\u2019s, namely, the significant difference in the\naverage extreme-intensity values was due to pronounced spatial\nvariation at the ploughed site and, more specifically, the deviant\nbehaviour of plot P4, as also readily appreciated in Fig. 5. Plot P4\nnot only produced, as mentioned above, consistently less sedi-\nment and/or runoff than the other extreme-intensity plot at the\nploughed site and even the neighbouring high-intensity plot but\nalso then the two extreme-intensity plots at the unploughed site.\nThus, the extreme-intensity results of this study were strongly\ninfluenced by a highly localised and rather accidental factor like\nlitter fall from scorched crowns.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nThe main conclusions from this study include the following:\n\n? Extreme-intensity RSE\u2019s (80\u201385 mm h?1) tended to generate\nlarger amounts of runoff and, thereby, higher losses of soil and\n\norganic matter than high-intensity RSE\u2019s (45\u201350 mm h?1);\nhowever, this tendency was not invariable either in space or, at\na certain location, through time.\n? Within-site variability in runoff and erosion response was\n\nmore pronounced in the case of the extreme- than high-\nintensity RSE\u2019s, so that their modelling will require greater\nefforts in terms of model calibration and/or obtaining plot-\nspecific information.\n? Runoff and associated sediment losses varied significantly with\n\ntime-after-fire; however, this temporal pattern did not\ncorrespond to a simple decrease with time but had a marked\nseasonal component, which broadly agreed with the role of\ntopsoil water repellency in enhancing overland flow genera-\ntion under dry antecedent weather conditions.\n? The risk of enhanced runoff generation and erosion in recently\n\nburnt eucalypt stands does not necessarily disappear with the\nfirst significant rains after the wildfire but can persist through\nmost of the first autumn and also re-appear after subsequent\ndry spells as long as 2 years later; this could be attributed to\nthe typically pronounced water repellency of eucalypt forest\nsoils combined with an often slow post-fire vegetation\nrecovery.\n? Contrary to expected, the unploughed site produced more\n\nrunoff and erosion than the adjacent unploughed site. Besides\nsoil properties altered by ploughing, the difference in slope\nangle between the two sites could play a role. These possible\nexplanations will be further explored using the MEFIDIS\nerosion model as research tool.\n? The sediment losses at the two study sites were low compared\n\nto those obtained with similar methodologies (i.e. field rainfall\nsimulation experiments on small plots) following wildfires in\nother parts of the world. Nonetheless, they need to be\nevaluated against the typically shallow soil depths on the\nsteep hill slopes in the study area, with the elevated organic\nmatter fractions in the observed sediment losses requiring\nspecial attention.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the help of Raquel Ferreira, Mart\nHoumann, Mark Lagewaard, Angela Garc??a-Monge, David Herrera\n\nRSE-campaigns\n\nvegetation/litter cover (cover classes) stone cover (cover classes)\n\nU2- vegetation\n\nP4\n\nP2\n\nU2\n\nU4\n\nU4 - vegetation RSE-campaigns\n\nP4 - litter\n\nP2 - litter\n\nFig. 6.

To this end, a down\nslope ploughed, a contour ploughed and a terraced site were compared with three unploughed sites. Runoff\nand erosion data were collected in the field by carrying out rainfall simulation experiments (RSEs) with two\nintensities (45\u201350 and 80\u201385 mm h?1) at six occasions during the first one to two years following wildfires\nin 2005 and 2006.\nOverall runoff coefficients varied markedly amongst the six study sites and between the two intensities (7 to\n55%). While runoff figures were comparable to those of prior RSE studies in recently burnt areas, overall sed-\niment losses were comparatively low (7\u2013155 g m?2) but contained a substantial organic matter fraction\n(29\u201374%). Apparently, the inter-rill erosion rates were essentially sediment-limited, fitting in with the long\nhistory of intensive land use that is typical in the Mediterranean Basin. The hydrological and erosion impacts\nof the three pre-fire ground preparation operations were minor, probably because these operations took\nplace several years before the latest wildfire. Overall, the two rainfall intensities produced the expected\ndifferences but this effect was only statistically significant for simultaneous RSEs. Furthermore, the effect of\nrainfall intensity varied markedly between the study sites and, occasionally, between the two plot pairs at\nthe same site. This impeded an erosion risk ranking of the six study sites that was consistent for both rainfall\nintensities. Runoff and erosion rates did not decrease in a simple or pronounced manner with time-since-fire.\nThese temporal patterns could in part be attributed to changes in soil water repellency but other factors were\ninvolved as well. Removal of the protective soil cover by litter in particular appeared to play a key role in the\nincrease in sediment losses following logging and wood extraction.\n\n\u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\n\nWildfires are a common phenomenon in present-day Portugal and\nhave affected an average of 100,000 ha of rural lands per year over\nthe past three decades (Pereira et al., 2005). Two key factors behind\nthe elevated wildfire incidence in Portugal are land abandonment and\nwidespread planting of highly flammable pines and eucalypts (Carmo\net al., 2011; Moreira et al., 2001). Due to the structural nature of these\nunderlying causes, combined with an increase in meteorological condi-\ntions propitious to wildfire (longer and more frequent drought pe-\nriods), wildfire occurrence in Portugal is also not expected to decrease\nin the foreseeable future (Pereira et al., 2006).\n\nWildfires can produce marked changes in hydrological and erosion\nprocesses (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). Fire-enhanced runoff and erosion\nrates are attributed to the (partial) removal of the protective vegetation\nand litter cover, and to heating-induced alterations in soil properties con-\ntrolling runoff generation and soil erodibility such as soil water repellen-\ncy and aggregate stability, respectively (Mataix-Solera et al., 2011;\nShakesby, 2011; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006; Varela et al., 2010). Strong\nincreases in runoff and erosion following wildfire have also been\nreported for the two principal forest types in north-central Portugal,\ni.e. Maritime Pine and eucalypt plantations (e.g. Coelho et al., 2004;\nFerreira et al., 1997; Shakesby et al., 1994). Eucalypt plantations are typ-\nically associated with elevated levels of soil water repellency (Doerr et\nal., 1998, 2000; Ferreira et al., 2008; Keizer et al., 2005b, 2008; Scott,\n2000), and their crucial importance for post-fire runoff generation was\ndemonstrated by Leighton-Boyce et al. (2007).\n\nPost-fire forestry practices can contribute markedly to an enhanced\nhydrological and erosion response of recently burnt areas (Fern\u00e1ndez\n\nCatena 108 (2013) 69\u201383\n\n?

In the study region, rip-ploughing in down\nslope direction to prepare eucalypt planting increased sediment losses\nto rates well beyond those immediately after fire (Shakesby et al.,\n1996, 2002; Walsh et al., 1995). Contour ploughing and terracing are\nalso regularly employed in recently burnt areas in the study region,\nbut their erosion implications remain to be studied. The role of\npre-fire ground preparation techniques (i.e. when ploughing and ter-\nracing took place before the latest wildfire) has equally received little\nresearch attention, in spite forest lands in north-central Portugal \u2014 as\nis typical for many Mediterranean landscapes (Shakesby, 2011) \u2014 are\nnowadays an intricate mosaic of terraced, ploughed and unploughed\nterrains. Malvar et al. (2011) compared an eucalypt plantation that\nhad been ploughed in down slope direction several years before a wild-\nfire with an adjacent unploughed eucalypt plantation, finding no\nmarked differences in immediate post-fire erosion rates.\n\nWhile there is thus a strong need for an ERMIT-like tool (Robichaud\net al., 2007) for assessing soil erosion risk in recently burnt areas in\nPortugal, its development is constrained by a lack of data for model pa-\nrameterization and assessment. In the EROSFIRE project, field rainfall\nsimulation experiments (RSEs) were selected to overcome some of\nthese data constraints, focussing on the comparison of different pre-\nfire ground preparation techniques. RSEs have well-known limitations\nin terms of reproducing natural rainfall events and erosion processes\nbeyond small spatial scales (e.g. Rickson, 2001). However, they avoid\nthe confounding effects of seasonal and inter-annual variations in rain-\nfall that are typical for erosion plot data (Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2005;\nShakesby et al., 1993; Spigel and Robichaud, 2007) and, thus, facilitate\nthe comparison of results obtained at different moments in time after\na certain wildfire as well as in study areas burnt by different wildfires\n(e.g. Cerd\u00e0, 1998). Seasonal differences in erosion deserve special atten-\ntion when studying eucalypt plantations, because of the supposed role of\nsoil water repellency in runoff generation (Doerr et al., 2006; Ferreira et\nal., 2000; Keizer et al., 2005a; Sheridan et al., 2007), on the one hand, and,\non the other, the well-known variation in repellency with dry and wet\nseasons (Doerr et al., 2000; Keizer et al., 2005b; Leighton-Boyce\net al., 2005). RSEs have been widely used in post-fire erosion studies\n(e.g. Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2001; Coelho et al., 2004;\nKutiel et al., 1995; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Sevink et al., 1989) but\nonly Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr (2005), Sheridan et al. (2007) and Malvar et al.\n(2011) did so at more than a single moment in time after fire.\n\nThe present study was an extension of Malvar et al. (2011) in two\nmanners. It included pre-fire contour ploughing and terracing, two\nfurther pre-ground preparation operations that, unlike down slope\nploughing, are well-established soil conservation practices. Also, it in-\ncluded two additional unploughed eucalypt plantations that were\nburnt by a different wildfire and one of which was logged during\nthe study period (by chance). The specific objectives of the present\nstudy were to assess and evaluate how post-fire runoff and erosion\nrates: (i) differed amongst eucalypt plantations that had and had\nnot suffered contrasting ground preparation operations before the latest\nwildfire; (ii) varied with time-since-fire and, in particular, with temporal\npatterns in soil water repellency, vegetation recovery and post-fire forest-\nry operations; and (iii) differed between high- and extreme-intensity\nsimulated rainfall events (45\u201350 vs. 80\u201385 mm h?1).\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Study area and sites\n\nWithin the Aveiro District of north-central Portugal, the A\u00e7ores\nand Jafafe study locations were selected following a wildfire in July\n2005, and the Soutelo study location following a wildfire in August\n2006 (Fig. 1). Soutelo was the nearest 2006-burnt location to A\u00e7ores\nand Jafafe with the same geology (the distance is some 9 km towards\neast). A total of six hillslopes \u2014 two per study location \u2014 were select-\ned to compare eucalypt plantations (Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) with and\n\nwithout ground preparation techniques carried out before the latest\nwildfire (Table 1). The three unploughed study sites were designated\nas UP05_A1 (UnPloughed, 2005-burnt, A\u00e7ores1), and UP06_S1 and\nUP06_S2 (2006-burnt, Soutelo1 and Soutelo2); the three intervened\nsites as DP05_A2 (Down slope Ploughed, A\u00e7ores2), CP05_J1 (Contour\nPloughed, Jafafe1) and ST05_J2 (Slope Terraced \u2014 i.e. the terraces\nwere not constructed in perpendicular direction to the main slope\nangle but at a considerable angle \u2014 Jafafe2). Judging by the remaining\neucalypt stumps, the ground preparation practices at all three sites\nwere carried out several years before the wildfire in 2005 but precise\nestimates could not be obtained. Although logging immediately after\nwildfire was commonly observed, only the UP06_S2 was logged during\nthe study period (in February 2007).\n\nA general characterisation of the study sites was carried out as soon\nas possible after their selection (Table 1). This involved a description of\nterrain physiognomy, the assessment of fire severity using five simple in-\ndices recorded at five points along a transect from the base to the top of\neach slope, the description and sampling of two soil profiles at the base\nand halfway each slope, and the laboratory analysis of these soil samples\nwith respect to bulk density (Porta et al., 2003), granulometric composi-\ntion (Guitian and Carballas, 1976) and organic matter content (Botelho\nda Costa, 2004). Wildfire severity was classified as moderate at all sites\ndue to the partial consumption of eucalypt canopies and shrub twigs,\nthe total consumption of the litter layer and the presence of black\nashes (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). The soils at the two A\u00e7ores sites\nwere identified in the field as Umbric Leptosols and those at the\nremaining sites as Leptic Umbrisols (WRB, 2006). All soils were devel-\noped from pre-Ordovician schists of the Hesperic Massif (Ferreira and\nde Brum, 1978; Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995), and their upper 20 cm\nhad a coarse texture varying between sandy loam and clay loam, and a\nhigh organic matter content ranging from 5 to 11%.\n\nThe climate at the study sites is Mediterranean with ocean influence,\nand can be described as humid meso-thermal with prolonged dry and\nwarm summers (K\u00f6ppen-Csb; DRA-Centro, 2001). The long-term\nmean annual rainfall at the nearest rainfall station (Albergaria-a-Velha,\n4 km north of the A\u00e7ores sites; 1941\u20131991) was 1229 mm but annual\nrainfall varied markedly from 750 to 2022 mm. The long-term mean\nannual temperature at the nearest climate station (Estarreja, 17.5 km\nnorth-east of the A\u00e7ores sites; 1956\u20131977), with monthly mean tem-\nperatures ranging from 8.8 \u00b0C in December to 19.1 \u00b0C in July. The rain-\nfall during the study period was measured by installing at each study\nlocation a tipping-bucket rainfall gauge (Pronamic Professional Rain\nGauge) linked to a Hobo Event Logger (Onset Corporation) as well as\none or more storage gauges for validation purposes.\n\n2.2. Experimental design\n\nThe present experimental design differed from that of the bulk of\npost-fire erosion studies employing field rainfall simulation experi-\nments (RSEs) in two respects, by repeating the RSEs at five or six oc-\ncasions on the same, permanent plots and by simultaneously carrying\nout high- and extreme-intensity RSEs (45\u201350 vs. 80\u201385 mm h?1) on\nadjacent, paired plots. At each study site, two pairs of permanent\nplots were installed halfway in the lower and upper section of the\nslope, and the two plots of each pair were randomly assigned the \u2014\nfixed \u2014 intensity to be applied throughout the study period. In the\ncase of the 2005-burnt sites, the permanent plots were installed dur-\ning the second and not the first campaign to allow for destructive soil\nmeasurements and sampling within this first set of plots (immediate-\nly following the end of the RSEs). In addition to each pair of RSE plots,\na third plot with the same dimensions was used for measuring initial\nsoil conditions, with a special interest in topsoil water repellency.\nBecause of the destructive nature of these measurements, the control\nplots were relocated between subsequent field campaigns but always\nsuch that they were at similar distances to the two associated RSE\nplots (generally at 3\u20135 m).\n\n70 M.C. Malvar et al. / Catena 108 (2013) 69\u201383\n\n\n\nIn total, 10 field campaigns were carried out between September\n2005 and July 2007 (Table 2). The six campaigns at the 2005-burnt\nsites concerned the first two years after fire, whereas the six cam-\npaigns at the 2006-burnt sites had to be limited to the first year\nafter fire (due to the project's end). At all study sites the first RSE\ncampaign was carried out within the first two months after the wild-\nfire but marked differences in antecedent rainfall (30\u2013120 mm) could\nnot be avoided (Fig. 1). From the total of 144 RSEs that were originally\nforeseen, 12 could not be carried out due to occasional malfunctioning\nof the extreme-intensity simulator in particular.\n\n2.3. Rainfall simulation experiments\n\nThe RSEs were carried out with two portable rainfall simulators\nfollowing the design by Cerd\u00e0 et al. (1997) and with modifications\nby De Alba (1997), including a square plot of 0.28 m2. The high\n(45\u201350 mm h?1) and extreme intensities (80\u201385 mm?1) were\nobtained using two distinct nozzles, the HARDI-1553-10 and -14,\nrespectively. The two intensities were chosen to represent the maxi-\nmum hourly rainfall at the Aveiro rainfall station for a 100-year re-\nturn period and the maximum hourly rainfall ever recorded in\nPortugal (Brand\u00e3o et al., 2001). The two default nozzles and two\nspare nozzles were (re-)calibrated in the laboratory before basically\nevery field campaign. This involved calibrating the rainfall intensity\nas well as its homogeneity using a minimum threshold of 75% for the\nChristiansen uniformity coefficient (Christiansen, 1941 in Stewart and\nHowell, 2003).\n\nIn the field, the RSEs were performed according to a fixed protocol\n(Shakesby et al., 2002). Prior to applying the artificial rain, the cover\nof the plots was described by recording the presence\u2013absence of var-\nious cover classes (stones, bare soil, litter, vegetation) in each of the\n5 cm\u00d75 cm cells of a 50 cm\u00d760 cm grid laid out over the plot. The\nsimulations themselves involved the application of the selected in-\ntensity during 1 h, the measurement of runoff at 1-minute intervals,\nand collection of up to five runoff samples (one from the start of the\nrunoff until its approximate stabilization, one from the end of the\nrainfall until the end of the runoff and three at the start, middle and\nend of the remaining period). These runoff samples were then later\nanalysed in the laboratory using the classical evaporation method\n(APHA, 1998) and the loss-on-ignition method (Botelho da Costa,\n2004) to determine their sediment and organic matter concentra-\ntions. Random roughness of the RSE plots was measured using a pin\nprofile meter and the PMPPROJ software (developed by J. Kilpelainen,\nAgricultural Research Centre, Jokioinen, Finland). This was done at a\nsingle occasion at the end of the RSE campaigns, and involved placing\nthe meter at three fixed positions within each RSE plot (at one, two\nand three quarters along the plot's length).\n\n2.4. Soil water repellency, moisture and resistance measurements\n\nAt five fixed points within the control plots, soil water repellency\nwas measured in situ at the soil surface as well as between 2\u20133 and\n7\u20138 cm depth (see Keizer et al. (2008) for further details). This was\ndone using the \u201cMolarity of Ethanol Droplet\u201d (MED) test, as specified\nin Doerr (1998) and slightly modified in our prior work (Keizer et al.\n\nFig. 1. Location of the three study sites and 4-day antecedent rainfall prior to the first rainfall simulation experiment at the six study sites (see Table 1 for site codes and Table 2 for\ntiming of first experiments).\n\n71M.C. Malvar et al. / Catena 108 (2013) 69\u201383\n\n\n\n(2005a, 2005b, 2008). Three droplets of increasing ethanol concen-\ntration classes (decreasing surface tension) (0, 0%; 1, 1%; 3, 3%; 3,\n5%; 4, 8.5%; 5, 13%; 6, 18%; 7, 24%; and 8, 36% or >36%) were applied\nto fresh parts of the soil until infiltration of at least two of three drop-\nlets of the same concentration that occurred within 5 s. The median\nethanol concentration was then used as test result.\n\nFollowing the repellency measurements, readings of volumetric\nsoil moisture content were made at the same five sampling points\nand the two sampling depths (2\u20133 and 7\u20138 cm) using an ML2 Theta\nProbe TM (Delta T-Devices Ltd.) inserted horizontally into the soil.\nIn the case of probe failure, a soil sample was collected and its mois-\nture content determined gravimetrically, as further detailed in Keizer\net al. (2008).\n\nPrior to the repellency and moisture measurements, the resistance\nof the soil surface to shear stress and penetration was measured at\n\nthe same five points within the plots, using a pocket vane tester and\na penetrometer.\n\n2.5. Data analysis\n\nData analysis was carried out using the SAS 9.2 software package (SAS\nInstitute, Inc., 2008). Rank-based and non-parametric tests were pre-\nferred, also because of the small number of observations (Ott and\nLongnecker, 2001). Testing focused on the differences between the two\nrainfall intensities, the differences within and between the study sites,\nand the differences between the successive field campaigns. The Mann\u2013\nWhitney U-test (MWU-t) and the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test were used to assess\noverall differences between two and more than two groups of obser-\nvations, respectively.

The Spearman rank correlation coef-\nficient (?) was used to explore the relationships of runoff and erosion\nrates with soil cover and soil resistance.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Overall runoff and inter-rill erosion rates\n\nThe hydrological and soil erosion response at the six study sites was\nsummarized for the six field campaigns together in Table 3. The high-\nand extreme-intensity RSEs produced different rankings of the six euca-\nlypt plantations in terms of overall runoff coefficients. The rankings\ncontrasted most pronouncedly for CP05_J1 and UP06_S2. At CP05_J1 the\noverall runoff coefficient of the high-intensity RSEs was twice as high as\nthat of the extreme-intensity RSEs, whereas the opposite was true for\nUP06_S2. If the risk of post-fire runoff generation at the different study\nsites is evaluated using the maximum runoff coefficient of the two inten-\nsities, the resulting ranking was surprising in two respects. First, the risk\nwas highest at the contour-ploughed CP05_J1 as well as at two of the\nthree unploughed sites (UP05_A1 and UP06_S2); second, the risk at the\nthird unploughed site (UP06_S1) was lowest.\n\nTotal soil and total organic matter losses at the micro-plot scale\ndepended strongly on overland flow generation (Fig. 2). For the entire\nset of 24 micro-plots, both losses were significantly and strongly correlat-\ned with total runoff (Spearman rank correlation coefficient=0.92\u20130.94;\npsb0.01). Correlation coefficients were similar when analysing the\nhigh- and extreme-intensity RSEs separately (Fig. 2). Consequently, the\nhigh- and extreme-intensity RSEs also did not produce entirely consistent\nrankings of the six eucalypt plantation in terms of overall inter-rill erosion\nrates. Likewise, erosion risk assessment based on the highest losses of the\ntwo intensities was surprising in that the risk was clearly highest at two of\nthe three unploughed sites (UP05_A1 and UP06_S2) and, at the same\ntime, lowest at the third unploughed site (UP06_S1).\n\nAs suggested by the strong correlations between erosion and run-\noff rates, the specific soil and organic matter losses revealed mostly\nminor differences (Fig. 2). The bulk of the values ranged from 0.14\nto 0.22 g of soil m?2 mm?1 runoff and from 0.08 to 0.13 g of organic\nmatter m?2 mm?1 runoff. Comparatively high specific losses were\nproduced by the extreme-intensity RSEs at the unploughed\nUP05_A1 and UP06_S2 sites, which in part explained the high total\nlosses of these RSEs. In the case of the UP06_S2 site, these high values\nwere largely due to a roughly 10-fold increase in specific losses\nfollowing manual logging (with a chain saw) and mechanised wood\nextraction. No such increase was observed for the high-intensity\nRSEs at the UP06_S2 site.\n\n3.2. Variation with rainfall intensity\n\nThe data set as a whole revealed that the high- and extreme-\nintensity RSEs produced significantly different responses in runoff and\ninter-rill erosion (Table 4). This was true for the individual RSEs as\nwell as for the average responses of the simultaneous RSEs. The signifi-\ncant role of application rate was, however, location- and RSE campaign-\nspecific, as indicated by the fact that significant differences were\nrestricted to the Wilcoxon's signed ranks test. Thus, there was an overall\ntendency for extreme-intensity RSEs to produce significantly larger\nquantities of overland flow and significantly greater total as well as spe-\ncific soil and organic matter losses than the high-intensity RSEs carried\nout at the location (plot pair or study site) and same time.\n\nThe role of rainfall intensity was less straightforward at the level of\nthe individual study sites (Table 4; Fig. 3). Significant differences be-\ntween the paired RSEs were basically limited to four of the six study\nsites, i.e. the terraced and the three unploughed sites. In agreement\nwith the overall pattern for the entire data set, the extreme-intensity\nRSEs produced significantly higher runoff and inter-rill erosion rates\nthan the high-intensity RSEs at UP05_A1, UP06_S2 and ST_05_J2. The op-\nposite, however, was true at UP06_S01. From the two remaining sites,\nCP05_J1 revealed a similar tendency as UP06_S1 whereas DP05_A2\nlacked an apparent pattern, with its paired observations almost evenly\ndistributed above/below the 1:1 line or coinciding with it.\n\nThe unexpected and unclear differences at UP06_S1, CP05_J1 and\nDP05_A2 were further explored by comparing the results for the two\nplot pairs separately, both graphically (Fig. 4) and statistically (Wilcoxon's\nsigned-ranks test). In the case of the down slope ploughed DP05_A2 site,\nthe extreme-intensity RSEs produced significantly more runoff than the\nhigh-intensity RSEs at the upper slope section but significantly less at\nthe lower slope section. Also one of the plot pairs at CP05_J1 as well\nas at UP06_S1 revealed consistently lower runoff quantities for the\nextreme- than high-intensity RSEs, while the other plot pair revealed at\nleast a tendency to the same effect. As illustrated in Fig. 4, consistent dif-\nferences between neighbouring plots were not limited to time-invariant\nproperties such as micro-topography but also included protective litter\nand/or vegetation cover. This resulted from highly localized litter fall\nfrom scorched tree canopies as well as the generally sparse recovery of\nthe spontaneous vegetation.\n\n3.3. Spatial variability\n\n3.3.1. Within-site variability\nThe RSEs did not tend to produce significantly different runoff and\n\ninter-rill erosion responses at the two plots subjected to the same appli-\ncation rates at each study site (Table 5).

In the case of\nthe down slope ploughed site (DP05_A2), the significant differences at\nDP05_A2 were consistent with differences in protective vegetation\nand especially litter cover throughout the six campaigns (Fig. 4).\nThose at UP06_S1, however, lacked an obvious relationship with the\navailable plot data. For example, the runoff differences in May 2007\nagreed with the differences in median levels of soil water repellency\n(extreme-ethanol class 8 vs. strong-ethanol class 5) but the runoff dif-\nferences of the other campaigns did not.\n\n3.3.2. Between-site variability\nThe same-intensity RSEs produced various significant runoff and ero-\n\nsion differences amongst the 2005-burnt eucalypt plantations (Table 6).\n\nSignificant differences were more common for the individual RSEs\nthan for the sites' average responses, for runoff than soil and espe-\ncially organic matter losses, and for total than specific soil losses.\nFurthermore, many significant differences were strictly campaign-\nspecific as indicated by the discrepancies in the results of the\nWilcoxon's signed-ranks test and Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. The significant\ndifferences produced by the high-intensity RSEs coincided with those of\nthe extreme-intensity RSEs in three out of the six cases. In one of these\ncases, however, the two application rates resulted in opposite differ-\nences. The high-intensity RSEs produced significantly more runoff and\ngreater soil losses at the contour-ploughed CP05_J1 site than at the\nterraced ST05_J2, whereas the opposite was true for the extreme-\nintensity RSEs (Fig. 5). The latter reflected the fact that one of the\nextreme-intensity plots at CP05_J1 stood out for produced exceptionally\n\nFig. 2.

They were consistent\nfor the individual RSEs and their average responses, as well as consistent\nthroughout the first year after fire and not just campaign-specific. They\ndid, however, reflect somewhat deviant behaviour of the extreme-\nintensity plots at UP06_S1. These plots mostly produced less runoff and\nerosion than the paired high-intensity plots, due to factors unrelated to\nvegetation-litter cover (Figs. 4, 5).\n\n3.4. Temporal patterns\n\nRunoff generation and inter-rill erosion at the 2005-burnt sites\nvaried significantly amongst the six field campaigns (Table 7). Signif-\nicant variation existed in total as well as specific runoff and erosion\nrates, for the individual RSEs as well as their site-wise mean values,\nand in terms of overall differences (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test) as well as\nspecific differences between repeated observations (Friedman test).\nIn the case of the 2006-burnt sites, however, significant differences\namongst the six campaigns were largely restricted to the erosion\nrates, the individual RSEs and the repeated observations.\n\nA sharp contrast between the 2005- and 2006-burnt study sites\nwas also evident from the test results for the pairs of consecutive\n\ncampaigns (Table 7). The 2005-burnt sites revealed significant overall\n(Mann\u2013Whitney U-test) as well as plot-specific (Wilcoxon's signed-\nranks test) differences in two instances and these differences\nconcerned basically all parameters. Runoff and erosion rates decreased\nsignificantly from the 2nd to the 3rd campaign and increased signifi-\ncantly from the 5th to the 6th campaign (Fig. 6). The 2006-burnt sites\nalso revealed the majority of significant differences in two instances\nbut these differences were plot-specific and especially concerned total\nlosses in soil and organic matter. The plots produced significantly small-\ner losses in February 2007 than in both December 2006 and May 2007.\nThe increase in erosion rates between February and May 2007 was not\nrestricted to the site that was logged in that period (UP06_S2). Total\nlosses of soil and organic matter of the 132 RSEs were strongly correlat-\ned with runoff volumes (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient=\n0.93\u20130.94; pb0.01). Further analysis of the above-mentioned signifi-\ncant differences between consecutive campaigns therefore focussed\non overland flow generation and, in particular, on the role therein of\nsoil water repellency. Changes in water repellency at the 2005-burnt\nsites agreed well with both the decrease in runoff between November\n2005 and April 2006, and its increase between October 2006 and July\n2007. This was true for changes in median repellency levels as well as\nfor changes in the frequency of extreme repellency (ethanol class>7;\nFig. 7). The remarkably low runoff in July 2006, however, fitted in poorly\nwith the very strong median repellency level (ethanol class 7) but not\n\nFig. 3. Scatter plots of runoff, soil and organic matter losses for the pairs of simultaneous, high- and extreme-intensity rainfall simulation experiments at the six study sites\n(see Table 1 for the site codes). The sites are organized according to the three study locations (left \u2014 A\u00e7ores; middle \u2014 Jafafe; right \u2014 Soutelo), and the 1:1 line is added to facilitate\nthe appreciation of consistent differences.\n\n75M.C.

In the case\nof the 2006-burnt sites, the significant decrease in runoff between\nDecember 2006 and February 2007 seemed unrelated to soil water\nrepellency since the median ethanol class was 0 at both occasions. The\nsubsequent increase in runoff, on the other hand, coincided with a pro-\nnounced rise in repellency severity, both in terms of median ethanol\nclasses and frequency of extreme repellency.\n\nThe role of the three ground cover classes and the two soil erodibility\nparameters was tested as well (Table 8). Runoff volumes and total\nlosses could be explained best by differences in litter cover in particular,\nwhereas specific losses were most closely associated to variations in re-\nsistance to especially shear stress. Litter covers above 35\u201340% effectively\nreduced inter-rill erosion rates (Fig. 8). Contrary to litter cover, ash\ncover seemed to enhance overland flow generation and the associated\nlosses. The limited role of vegetation cover reflected a slow and spatially\nheterogeneous post-fire recovery, as well-illustrated by the fact that\nonly 2 out of 24 plots had attained a vegetation cover of over 30% one\nyear after the wildfire.\n\n4. Discussion\n\n4.1. Overall runoff and inter-rill erosion rates\n\nThe observed runoff and inter-rill erosion rates suggested that\npre-fire ground preparation practices were not a key factor in post-\nfire erosion risk. This not only applied in relation to down slope\nploughing, confirming the findings by Malvar et al. (2011), but also to\ncontour ploughing and the construction of sloping terraces. Specific\nsoil loss rates tended to vary little with either runoff volumes or the\ntwo rainfall intensities, suggesting that inter-rill erosion at the six\nstudy sites was by and large sediment-limited. Even so, the results at\nthe UP05_A1 and UP06_S2 sites indicated that extreme rainfall events\ncan provoke comparatively high specific soil losses at recently burnt eu-\ncalypt plantations with relatively undisturbed soil profiles and, suppos-\nedly, greater sediment availability.\n\nComparison of the overall runoff and erosion rates of this study with\nthose of prior RSE studies was not straightforward, mainly because the\n\nTable 5\nStatistical comparison of within-site differences in runoff and inter-rill erosion produced by the high-/extreme-intensity rainfall simulation experiments at each of the six study\nsites (see Table 1 for site codes).

Malvar et al. / Catena 108 (2013) 69\u201383\n\n\n\nbulk of the prior studies concerned singular moments in time after fire. In\nthe case of Portugal, this was well illustrated by e.g. Coelho et al. (2004),\nFerreira et al. (2005a, 2005b), Leighton-Boyce et al. (2007) and Walsh et\n\nal. (1998). The overall figures at the Jafafe and Soutelo sites did not differ\nmarkedly from those at the A\u00e7ores sites, confirming the principal points\nthat emerged from the comprehensive comparison with literature in\nMalvar et al. (2011). They were that, while the observed runoff coeffi-\ncients were comparable to those from prior RSE studies in recently\nburnt areas, the specific soil losses were generally lower than those\nreported earlier, particularly outside Portugal. The elevated organic mat-\nter content of the eroded sediments, especially compared to the topsoil,\nwas also confirmed by the Jafafe and Soutelo results. This preferential re-\nmoval of a mixture of partially combusted plant material, black ashes and\ncharcoal with soil organic matter, was not reported by existing RSE stud-\nies, as they typically seemed to lack information on organic matter losses.\nThomas et al. (1999) and Fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2007), however, also found\nhigh organic matter fractions (25\u201380%) in sediments eroded under natu-\nral rainfall conditions from recently burnt pine and eucalypt stands in\nnorth-central Portugal and north-west Spain.\n\n4.2. Effects of rainfall intensity\n\nThe two rainfall intensities applied in this study had noticeable effects\non runoff volumes and inter-rill sediment losses. These effects, however,\ndepended strongly on time-invariant plot- and site-specific properties as\nwell as on changes in soil conditions with time-since-fire. Overall, the\nrole of rainfall intensity was less well-defined at the two ploughed sites\nthan at the other four sites. This could involve a chance factor,\nreflecting the increased spatial heterogeneity in micro-topographic\nand/or topsoil characteristics produced by ploughing. Such a random\neffect was most clearly suggested for the down slope ploughed site\n(DP05_A2), as the two plot pairs revealed contrasting differences\nbetween the two intensities.\n\nFig. 5.

Malvar et al. / Catena 108 (2013) 69\u201383\n\nimage of Fig.?5\n\n\nRunoff and erosion rates have been found to increase with rainfall in-\ntensity but not always in a simple manner or in a general sense (Arnaez\net al., 2007; Parsons and Stone, 2006; Tejada and Gonzalez, 2007). Thus,\nalthough perhaps surprising, the present results were not extraordinary\nin that the extreme-intensity RSEs produced significantly more overland\nflow and erosion than the high-intensity RSEs at three study sites and, at\nthe same time, significantly less at another site. There was a tendency for\na clearer role of rainfall intensity on erosion than runoff rates, in agree-\nment with RSE studies comparing constant vs. variable application\nrates s (Dunkerley, 2008; Frauenfeld and Truman, 2004; Parsons and\nStone, 2006; Truman et al., 2007).\n\nThe complex role of rainfall intensity could be due to an increase\nin steady-state infiltration rate with increasing rainfall intensity, as\n\nfound by Hawkings (1982 in Paige et al., 2002) Flanagan and Nearing\n(1995 in Paige et al., 2002) and Holden and Burt (2002). The authors\nattributed such an increase to the phenomenon of \u201cpartial area con-\ntribution\u201d, in which higher rainfall intensities simply produce greater\nfluxes of infiltration into those plot parts where infiltration capacities\nexceed the simulated rainfall intensities. This phenomenon could be\nespecially relevant in water repellent soils in recently burnt areas.\nThe ponded hydraulic conductivity of a burnt forest in Australia\nrevealed a very pronounced spatial variability, due to the presence\nof macro-pores in a soil matrix that was otherwise water repellent\n(Nyman et al., 2010). Ferreira et al. (2005a) and Shakesby and Doerr\n(2006) likewise stressed the importance of spatial patterns in infiltration\nrates, particularly due to soil water repellency, for overland flow\n\nFig. 6. Box plots of runoff (a, b) and total (c, d) and specific (e, f) soil losses produced by the individual rainfall simulation experiments during the six subsequent field campaigns at\nthe 2005-burnt (left) and 2006-burnt (right) sites.\n\n79M.C. Malvar et al. / Catena 108 (2013) 69\u201383\n\nimage of Fig.?6\n\n\ngeneration in recently burnt areas. Possibly, technical limitations\nmight have confounded the role of rainfall intensity in at least\nsome of the paired experiments. The extreme-intensity nozzles\nwere more difficult to calibrate than the high-intensity nozzles,\nespecially in terms of the uniformity threshold and in spite of the\nsomewhat limited sensitivity of the Christiansen coefficient\n(Lascelles et al., 2000). Furthermore, the extreme-intensity nozzles\nwere found to produce less constant soil moisture readings during\nthe field experiments than the high-intensity nozzles, suggesting\nless constant extreme- than high-intensity application rates.\n\n4.3. Within- and between-site spatial variability\n\nSignificant within-site differences between the plots subjected to the\nsame intensities were by and large limited to the extreme-intensity RSEs.\nApparently, the typically elevated spatial variability in soil erosion data\n(e.g. Nearing et al., 1999; Sheridan et al., 2007) was masked by applying\n45\u201350 mm h?1 as opposed to 80\u201385 mm h?1. The observed significant\nwithin-site differences proved difficult to explain in terms of individ-\nual controlling factors, also because of changing plot characteristics\n(e.g. vegetation and litter cover) and soil conditions (e.g. water\n\nFig. 7. Box plots of initial soil water repellency in terms of ethanol classes (a, b) and frequency of ethanol class >7 (c, d) as well as initial volumetric soil moisture content (e, f)\nduring the six subsequent field campaigns at the 2005-burnt (left) and 2006-burnt (right) sites.\n\n80 M.C. Malvar et al. / Catena 108 (2013) 69\u201383\n\nimage of Fig.?7\n\n\nrepellency) during the study period. Shakesby and Doerr (2006)\nlikewise argued that the role of soil water repellency in recently\nburnt areas is difficult to untangle from that of other factors by\nmeans of field studies.\n\nThe between-site differences sustained Malvar et al.'s (2011) find-\ning that pre-fire ground preparation operations lacked a clear impact\non post-fire runoff and inter-rill erosion rates. An obvious explanation\nwas that these operations had occurred sufficiently long ago for run-\noff and erosion rates to return to the background levels of long\nundisturbed forest stands. Shakesby et al. (1994) estimated that sed-\niment losses declined rapidly after rip-ploughing, which Walsh et al.\n(1995) attributed to a rapid increase in soil erodibility through selec-\ntive removal of the fine soil fraction by the initial erosion events.\nThese sediment losses after rip-ploughing were mainly due to\nconcentrated flow in down slope direction following the furrows.\nTherefore, the small plot size employed here could help explain the\nlimited impact of ground preparation operations, especially in the\ncase of the down slope ploughed site (DP05_A2).\n\n4.4. Temporal variability with time-since-fire\n\nThe timing of the RSEs had a prominent effect on the runoff and\ninter-rill erosion rates. The joint analysis of the four sites burnt in\n\n2005 agreed well with the analysis of two of them (UP05_A1/A2) in\nMalvar et al. (2011). The contrasting temporal patterns at the\n2006-burnt sites could be related to the timing of the RSEs and, in\nparticular, to the wetter antecedent rainfall conditions of the first\ntwo campaigns in October and November 2006. The comparatively\nminor temporal variation in runoff generation at the 2006-burnt\nsites could furthermore help explain the lack of overall as opposed\nto plot-specific differences. The shorter, 1- as opposed to 2-year\nstudy period at the 2006-burnt sites seemed of little influence; none-\ntheless, the last two campaigns at the 2005-burnt sites contributed\nmarkedly to the significant differences amongst their six campaigns.\n\nIn agreement with the two prior studies that also employed\nrepeated RSEs to study post-fire runoff and erosion (Cerd\u00e0 and\nDoerr, 2005; Sheridan et al., 2007), the temporal patterns in over-\nland flow generation could not be easily attributed to changes in\ntopsoil water repellency alone. This might be due to the fact that\nthe soil water repellency measurements were destructive and, thus,\nwere not carried out in the RSE plots themselves but in neighbouring\nplots. On the other hand, descriptors such as median ethanol class\nor its range might not fully capture the hydrological implications\nof soil water repellency, especially under heterogeneous repellency\nconditions.\n\nThe temporal patterns in inter-rill erosion rates with time-since-fire\nwere less straightforward than the pronounced decreases reported by\nSheridan et al. (2007) and especially Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr (2005). Thus,\nthe eucalypt plantations studied here did not reveal the marked transi-\ntion from transport- to sediment-limited erosion typically reported by\npost-fire erosion studies, including under natural rainfall conditions\n(see Shakesby, 2011; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). On the other hand,\nthe present soil loss figures did agree well with the tendency for low\nerosion rates in the Mediterranean region due to its long land-use histo-\nry (Shakesby, 2011). The elevated surface stone cover that emerged as\nthe ash layer was removed from the study sites together with the most-\nly shallow soil depth fitted in with an intensive use of the study sites in\nthe past.\n\nAlthough post-fire forestry operations and in particular logging\nwere commonly observed in the study areas, they only took place at\none of the six study sites. After logging and wood extraction, three\nof the four plots of the UP06_S2 site revealed an increased runoff\nand inter-rill erosion. This logging effect could be attributed to a\nmarked decrease in litter cover at all three plots. The litter cover\nalso decreased at the fourth, \u201cexceptional\u201d plot but this was \u201ccompen-\nsated\u201d by an exceptional increase in vegetation cover, attaining 70%.\nThese results fitted in well with the findings of Fern\u00e1ndez et al.\n(2007) that logging operations did not seriously affect soil erosion,\nexcept where they resulted in significant exposure of bare soil.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe principal conclusions of this study into post-fire runoff and\ninter-rill erosion in six recently burnt eucalypt plantations in north-\ncentral Portugal by means of repeated, high and extreme-intensity\nfield rainfall simulation experiments (RSEs) were as follows:\n\n(i) Erosion rates depended strongly on runoff volumes but\nseemed essentially sediment-limited. Namely, sediment losses\nwere markedly lower than in prior RSE studies in the study\nregion but especially outside Portugal, and did not reveal the\ncommonly observed, sharp decrease with time-since-fire;\n\n(ii) Mechanical ground preparation operations carried out several\nyears before the latest wildfire did not have major impacts on\npost-fire runoff and erosion rates. There were no striking differ-\nences between the three practices, despite contour-ploughing\nand terracing being commonly regarded as soil conservation\ntechniques as opposed to ploughing in down slope direction.\nFurthermore, the terraced and the two ploughed plantations\n\nTable 8\nSpearman rank correlation coefficients (?) of runoff and inter-rill erosion produced by\nthe individual rainfall simulation experiments with the three ground cover classes and\nthe two soil resistance parameters (n=132).

However,\nfurther work on the effect of logging is needed as the present ev-\nidence was based on a single study site;\n\n(iv) There was an overall tendency for extreme-intensity RSEs\n(80\u201385 mm h?1) to produce significantly more runoff and great-\ner soil and organic matter losses than their paired high-intensity\nRSEs (45\u201350 mm h?1). Nonetheless, the role of rainfall intensity\nwas unexpected in that it differed markedly amongst the six study\nsites as well as between the two plot pairs at some sites. This and\nespecially the lack of obvious explanations for the deviant results\nseriously hampered a consistent ranking of the six study sites in\nterms of post-fire erosion risk.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe present study was funded by the Foundation for Science and\nTechnology (FCT) of Portugal, with co-funding by FEDER through the\nPOCI2010 Programme, in the framework of the EROSFIRE project\n(POCI/AGR/60354/2004) and research grants of MMC (SFRH/BD/\n41320/2007) and JPCN (SFRH/BPD/39721/2007).

In order to assess some key factors \n\ncontrolling the hydrological and erosive response, an intensive monitoring (two-weekly) \n\nof selected soil properties was carried out.  \n\nRainfall was 35% higher during the second than first year following the fire, but the \n\nrunoff coefficient was around 20% for both sites and study years. By contrast, overall \n\nsediment losses differed significantly between the unploughed and the ploughed site \n\nduring the first post-fire year (415 vs. 125 g m-2 year-1), and even more during the \n\nsecond one (515 vs. 54 g m-2 year-1). The organic matter fraction of the eroded \n\nsediment amounted to ca. 50 % throughout the study period. Time since fire played a \n\nrole in runoff and erosion; however, post-fire runoff and erosion did not decrease \n\ngradually in the course of the study but revealed a marked seasonal component, with \n\nclear peaks surrounding the driest seasons.  \n\nRunoff generation could be explained best by rainfall amount or maximum rainfall \n\nintensity during fifteen minutes (I15) and then by surface cover and soil water \n\nrepellency. Maximum rainfall intensity substituted rainfall amount as main factor when a \n\nprotective surface cover was attained or when soils were wettable. The sediment \n\nlosses were explained best by I15 followed by surface cover. \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\nPost-fire runoff and erosion at the study sites was also studied by repeated rainfall \n\nsimulation experiences (RSE\u2019s). Comparison of the results obtained under natural and \n\nsimulated rainfall suggested that the RSE\u2019s captured well the specific sediment loss \n\nrates, the organic matter contents of the eroded sediments, and erosion rates \n\ndifferences between sites. The important role of soil water repellency in post-fire runoff \n\ngeneration in eucalypt stands was also evident from both methodologies \n\n \n\nKey words: wildfire, eucalypt, (un)ploughed, micro-plot, runoff, erosion, \n\nrainfall simulation,  \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nIn Portugal, the introduction of flammable tree species (pine and eucalypt \n\nplantations), together with a decline in traditional practices (grazing, coppicing, etc) \n\ngenerated a fire prone forest formation, which begun to suffer an increase in wildfire \n\nfrequency since the 1980s (Shakesby et al., 1996). Furthermore, the frequency of \n\nforest fires is expected to remain the same or increase in the future (Pereira et al., \n\n2006). Especially since the severe fire seasons of 2003 and 2005 (during both of which \n\nover 300.000 ha burnt; AFN, 2011), forest fires are now an important public concern in \n\nPortugal (Ferreira et al., 2008).  \n\nWildfires constitute a disturbance with a relatively severe but temporary impact \n\n(Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2005). Fires can reduce soil infiltration capacity and, consequently, \n\nincrease runoff and erosion (Spigel and Robichaud, 2007; Cerd\u00e0 and Robichaud, 2009; \n\nScott et al., 2009), thereby provoking on-site land degradation impacts such as soil \n\nfertility losses (Thomas et al., 1999; Verheijen et al., 2009), soil organic matter/carbon \n\nlosses (Spigel and Robichaud, 2007; Prats et al., 2012) as well as downstream \n\npollution with, for example, pyrolitic toxic compounds (Vila-Escal\u00e9 et al., 2007; Campos \n\net al. 2012).  \n\nLarge increases in runoff and erosion following wildfires have also been reported \n\nfor the two principal forest types in north-central Portugal, i.e. maritime pine and \n\neucalypt plantations (e.g. Shakesby et al., 1994; Ferreira et al., 1997; Coelho et al., \n\n2004). These prior studies commonly observed a pronounced temporal variability in \n\npost-fire runoff and erosion, associated to inter and intra-annual rainfall variability as \n\nwell as post-fire vegetation recovery (Shakesby et al., 1993; 1994, 1996). An important \n\nrole in the seasonal variations in erosion has frequently been attributed to soil water \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\nrepellency (Ferreira et al., 2000; Coelho et al., 2004; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; \n\nMalvar et al., 2011; Prats et al., 2012). This is especially the case for the eucalypt \n\nplantations in this region, as both long unburnt and recently burnt stands are typically \n\nassociated with very high to extreme hydrophobicity (e.g. Doerr et al. 1998, 2003, \n\n2006; Keizer et al., 2005a, 2005b; 2008; Malvar et al., 2011; Prats et al., 2012). These \n\nfactors limit the establishments of links between post-fire disturbances and enhanced \n\nrunoff and erosions rates. \n\nThe most commonly-used techniques to quantify post-fire runoff and erosion are \n\nrainfall simulation experiments (RSE\u2019s) (e.g. Sevink et al., 1989; Imeson et al., 1992; \n\nKutiel et al., 1995; Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2001; Johansen et al., 2001; \n\nCerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2005; Coelho et al., 2005; Ferreira et al., 2005a; Rulli et al., 2006; \n\nLeighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Sheridan et al., 2007) and runoff-erosion plots of various \n\ndimensions (e. g. Blong et al. 1982; D\u00edaz -Fierros et al.1987; Soto et al. 1994; \n\nShakesby et al. 1996; Soto and D\u00edaz-Fierros, 1998; Ferreira et al., 2000; Dragovich \n\nand Morris, 2002). RSE\u2019s have the advantages of producing repeatable rainfall events \n\nand, and being more time and cost-effective but, at the same time, have the \n\ndisadvantage of producing artificial rainfall events that, in general, have a constant \n\nintensity, a low kinetic energy and fall onto small surface areas (e.g. Rickson, 2001). \n\nThe representativeness of RSE results for post-fire runoff and erosion under natural \n\nrainfall condition constitutes an important research gap, since few studies have made a \n\ncomprehensive comparison of RSE- vs. plot-based runoff and erosion values. To \n\naddress this knowledge gap, the present, plot-based study concerns the same two \n\nsites as where Malvar et al. (2011) carried out RSE\u2019s at six occasions during the first \n\ntwo years after a wildfire.  \n\nThe main goal of this research was to assess the role of management practices in \n\npost-fire runoff and erosion in eucalyptus plantations in north-central Portugal. To this \n\nend, overland flow generation and the associated losses of soil and organic matter \n\nwere compared for two contrasting eucalypt plantations, one of which had been \n\nploughed before the wildfire whereas the other had not. This was done using micro-\n\nplots of the same dimensions as those used by Malvar et al. (2011) for repeated RSE\u2019s \n\nat the same two sites. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) determine the \n\nbetween-site variability in runoff and erosion; (ii) assess the temporal patterns in runoff \n\nand erosion with time since fire; (iii) identify the key factors explaining the spatial and \n\ntemporal runoff and erosion patterns; (iv) compare the runoff and erosion rates \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\nproduced under natural rainfall conditions with those produced by artificial events of \n\nhigh and extreme intensity (45-50 vs. 80-85 mm h-1). \n\n \n\n2. Materials and methods  \n\n2.1 Study sites \n\nThis study was conducted near the A\u00e7ores locality of the Albergaria-a-Velha \n\nmunicipality, north-central Portugal, in an area that was burned by a wildfire during \n\nearly July 2005. Two adjacent commercial eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) \n\nplantations were selected for their contrasting pre-fire land management practices, both \n\nwhich are commonly found in the study region. At the \u201cunploughed\u201d site, trees had \n\nbeen planted without mechanical ground operations, so that the soil profile was \n\nundisturbed. At the \u201crip-ploughed\u201d site, a clear pattern of ridges and furrows (up to 20 \n\ncm high) running down the slope was present. Judging by the remaining tree stumps, \n\nboth study sites had undergone at least two eucalypt regrowth cycles prior to the 2005-\n\nfire. Both sites has steep slopes but were relatively short, due to extensive network of \n\npaths in the area (Table 1). The 2005-fire had burnt the two sites with moderate \n\nseverity, according to simple field indicators such as the consumption of tree canopies, \n\nthe undergrowth and litter layer as well as the colour of the ashes (Shakesby and \n\nDoerr, 2006; Table 1). The soils at both sites were described by digging two soil \n\nprofiles (at the base and halfway the slope) and collecting various samples. The soil \n\nsamples collected at 0-5 cm depth were analysed in the laboratory with respect to bulk \n\ndensity (Porta et al., 2003), soil texture (Guitian and Carballas, 1976) and organic \n\nmatter content (Botelho da Costa, 2004). The soil profiles corresponded to Umbric \n\nLeptosols (WRB, 2006) that were developed from pre-Ordovician schists of the \n\nHesperic Massif (Ferreira and de Brum, 1978; Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995). The top 5 \n\ncm of the soils had a coarse texture, varying between sandy clay loam to clay loam, \n\nwith an organic matter content of 10% (Table 1). \n\nThe climate at the study sites is Mediterranean and has an oceanic influence. It \n\ncan be classified as humid meso-thermal with prolonged dry and warm summers (Csb, \n\naccording to K\u00f6ppen; DRA-Centro, 2001). The long-term mean annual temperature at \n\nthe nearest climate station (\u201cEstarreja\u201d, 17.5 km north-west of the study sites)was 13.9 \n\n\u00baC, with monthly mean temperatures ranging from 8.8 \u00b0C in December to 19.1 \u00b0C in \n\nJuly (reference: 1956-1977). The long-term mean annual rainfall at the nearest rainfall \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\nstation (\u201cAlbergaria-a-Velha\u201d, 4 km north of the study sites) was 1229 mm but annual \n\nrainfall varied markedly from 750 to 2022 mm (reference: 1941-1991).  \n\n \n\n2.2 Experimental design \n\nEach site was instrumented with two pairs of square micro-plots (0.28 m2) installed \n\nhalfway in the lower and upper sections of the slope. Erosion episodes from a few \n\nrainfall events (up to 80 mm) occurred between the fire and the installation of the plots. \n\nAfterwards, during a period of 22 months, including 83 field trips, data was collected on \n\nrunoff, soil erosion and several explanatory variables. \n\nRainfall was measured with a tipping-bucket rainfall gauge (Pronamic Professional \n\nRain Gauge, Ringk\u00f8bing, Denmark). Surface runoff was accumulated and measured in \n\ntanks, weekly 1.5 l runoff samples were taken for laboratory determinations, which \n\nincluded sediments concentration, following the classical evaporation method (APHA, \n\n1998) and organic matter fraction on the eroded sediments following the loss-on-\n\nignition method (Botelho da Costa, 2004). Plot surface cover was described every two \n\nweeks by recording the presence\u2013absence of five cover categories in each of the 5 cm \n\n\u00d7 5 cm cells of a grid (50 cm x 60 cm) laid out over the plot. The described cover \n\ncategories were: stones (including rock outcrop and stones higher than 2 mm \n\ndiameter), bare soil, litter (including all dead plant materials such as leaves, bark, \n\nstems, etc.), vegetation and ashes. Every two weeks, one transect of five (or three, \n\nfrom June 2006 onwards) equidistant sampling points along the slope length was \n\nselected to measure several soil properties. At each sampling point, the resistance of \n\nthe soil surface to shear stress and penetration was measured three times using a \n\npocket vane tester and a penetrometer. At the same spot, three soil water repellency \n\n(SWR) measurements were done in situ at the soil surface and between 2\u20133 and 7\u20138 \n\ncm depth. This was done using the \u201cMolarity of Ethanol Droplet\u201d (MED) test (Doerr \n\n(1998), Keizer et al. 2005a, 2005b, 2008). Three droplets of increasing ethanol \n\nconcentration classes (decreasing surface tension) (0, 0%; 1, 1%; 2, 3%; 3, 5%; 4, \n\n8.5%; 5, 13%; 6, 18%; 7, 24%; and 8, 36% or >36%) were applied to undisturbed parts \n\nof the soil until infiltration of at least two of three droplets of the same concentration had \n\noccurred within 5 s. Following the repellency measurements, at the same sampling \n\npoints and depths, readings of volumetric soil moisture content were done (ML2 Theta \n\nProbe TM; Delta T-Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK), (see Keizer et al. (2008) for further \n\ndetails). The random roughness of the plots was also determined, using a pin profile \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\nmeter. This was done by placing the device at three fixed positions within each plot (at \n\none, two and three quarters along the plot's length) (Table 1). \n\n \n\n2.3 Data analysis \n\nRainfall amount, maximum rainfall intensity in 15 minutes (I15), rainfall kinetic \n\nenergy (KE), erosivity (R) (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978), and total event intensity were \n\ncalculated on rainfall event basis. Events were separated by periods of at least 6 h with \n\nno precipitation. When multiple rainfall events occurred in a period between the weekly \n\nrunoff and erosion measurements, total rainfall amount and erosivity, maximum I15, \n\nmaximum KE and maximum of total event intensity were the rainfall characteristics \n\nassociated to the measured runoff and sediment. SWR measurements in ethanol class, \n\nat soil surface and 2-3 cm depth, were used to calculate the median ethanol \n\nconcentration, the frequency of strong (SWR> 5 ethanol class; Freq5), very strong \n\n(SWR> 6 ethanol class) and extreme repellency (SWR> 7 ethanol class).  \n\nData analysis was carried out using the SAS 9.2 software package (SAS Institute, \n\nInc., 2008). The significance level for all the statistical tests was 0.05. Repeated \n\nmeasures analysis (ANOVA-2 way) was performed in order to determine the site and \n\ntime influence on runoff and erosion measurements, with the plot as subject of \n\nrepeated measured. The time factors tested were the annual and monthly values. \n\nWhen the overall effect was significant, a post-hoc LS-Means adjusted Tukey\u2019s test \n\nwas used to assess in which periods the sites produced significantly different runoff \n\nand erosion values (Littel et al., 2006). In order to fit the normality assumption, the total \n\nrunoff was log-transformed and square root transformation was used for the runoff \n\ncoefficient, the erosion variables were fourth root transformed and the organic matter \n\ncontent was not transformed. The variance-covariance structure for the dependent \n\nvariables was selected according to the smaller -2 restricted log likelihood (Littel et al., \n\n2006). \n\nForward stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the influence on the \n\nweekly runoff and erosion measurements of the following 16 explanatory variables: (i) \n\nRelated with rainfall: rainfall amount, rainfall Kinetic energy, erosivity, I15, event \n\nintensity and antecedent rainfall; (ii) Related with soil water repellency: frequency of \n\nstrong, very strong and extreme repellency; (iii) Related with soil: soil moisture, soil \n\nresistance to shear stress and penetration; (iv) Related with plot: position (top, bottom), \n\nslope angle, plot roughness and plot surface cover (ash, bare, litter, stone, vegetation). \n\nCollinearity diagnostics was used to determine the explanatory variables which were \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\nrelated, removing those with condition index higher than 10 (Belsley et al., 1980). To \n\nbetter achieve the normality of the model residuals, periods with rainfall less than 10 \n\nmm and therefore runoff less than 4 mm were removed. \n\nThe differences between sites of the explanatory variables, including plot basis \n\n(surface cover) and transect basis measurements (soil moisture, soil water repellency \n\nand soil resistance), were tested through Mann-Whitney U-test (MWU-t) and \n\nWilcoxon\u2019s signed-ranks test (WSR-T). \n\n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1 Annual rainfall, runoff and erosion rates. \n\nTable 2 summarizes the annual rainfall, runoff and erosion rates measured in the \n\nmicro-plots. Rainfall volume was 35% higher during the second than from the first study \n\nyear (1048 vs. 1608 mm). Compared to the long-term mean annual rainfall (1229 mm), \n\nthe rainfall amount on the first post-fire year was 15% lower whereas on the second \n\nyear it was 30% above. I15 was also higher during the second year, and consequently, \n\nthe rainfall erosivity of the second study year was twice that of the first one (3115 vs. \n\n1412 MJ mm ha-1 h-1).  \n\nFollowing the increase in rainfall amount, the average runoff amount also increased \n\nfrom year 1 (228 mm) to year 2 (368 mm, 40% increase), but this was more \n\npronounced in the case of the unploughed site (426 mm, 47% increase) when \n\ncompared to the ploughed site (310 mm, 26% increase). The analysis of variance \n\n(Table 2) revealed that there was a significant difference in runoff between the two \n\npost-fire years (F=8.84; p<0.05), but not between the two sites (F=5.40; p>0.05). \n\nHowever, year-to-year differences were only significant in terms of runoff amount. In \n\nfact, the runoff coefficient was about 20% for both sites and post-fire years. Opposite \n\nfrom the runoff results, erosion variables did not follow variations in annual rainfall. \n\nSediment losses were equal for post-fire year 1 and 2 (averaging 270 vs. 284 g m-2), \n\nwhile specific sediment losses were significantly higher in year 1 than year 2 \n\n(averaging 1.18 vs. 0.68 g m-2 mm-1 runoff). Despite the similar runoff patterns between \n\nsites, there was a strong site effect on the erosion response (Table 2). The sediment \n\nlosses as well as specific rates were significantly higher in the unploughed than in the \n\nploughed site, probably due to lower sediment availability at the ploughed site. \n\nHowever, time (annual) effect over erosion was not consistent between sites and also \n\nbetween total and specific sediment rates. The sediment losses increased from the first \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nyear to the second in the unploughed site but decreased in the ploughed site. This also \n\nled to an increase in the differences in sediment losses between sites with time. \n\nNevertheless, lower sediment availability on the second year was indicated by a \n\nsignificantly reduction in specific sediment rate for both sites. Finally, the organic matter \n\nfraction was roughly half of the eroded sediments, with an increasing trend with year \n\nsince fire but no significant differences between sites. \n\nThe annual runoff and erosion values by plot pointed out that erosion was rather \n\nsediment than transported limited, as sediment transport did not simple increased with \n\nrunoff amounts, especially on the second year (Figure 1). In the unploughed site, both \n\nrunoff and sediment losses increased similarly for all the plots between year 1 and 2 \n\n(Figure 1a). In the ploughed site, runoff increased from year 1 to year 2 in all the plots \n\nbut decreased in plot 8, whereas sediment losses decreased in all but plot 6. Despite \n\nthese inconsistent plot patterns, the specific sediment losses invariably decreased \n\nbetween year 1 and 2 (Figure 1b).  \n\nThe plot variability within-site in terms of runoff, but mainly in the erosion response \n\nwas consistently higher in the first than in the second post-fire year, and in the \n\nploughed compared to the unploughed site (coefficient of variation of sediment losses \n\n87 and 19% respectively). Probably as consequence of the increasing in specific-plot \n\ncharacteristics variability by the ploughing (see Table 1). \n\n \n\n3.2 Temporal patterns  \n\n3.2.1. Temporal patterns of surface cover, soil water repellency and soil moisture \n\nThe surface cover evolved following the washing up of the ashes, the subsequent \n\nexposure of a stone lag, and the development of a vegetation and litter. Ash cover \n\ndecreased as the other categories increased (Figure 2). Besides these similarities, \n\nthere were differences between sites. Litter fall from burned eucalypt trees and \n\nvegetation regrowth was lower in the unploughed compared to the ploughed site. \n\nConversely, stone cover was higher in the unploughed site. Those differences were \n\nstatistically significant globally (MW U-test) and also temporally specific (Wilcoxon\u2019s S\u2013\n\nR test) (Table 3). For example one year after the fire, the mean litter plus vegetation \n\ncover in the unploughed site was 25% whereas in the ploughed site was 50%. At the \n\nsame time, stone cover in the unploughed site was about 40% and 18% in the \n\nploughed site. Additionally, bare soil was lower than 5% for both sites during all the \n\nstudy period. Furthermore, the within-site variability of plot surface cover also increased \n\nprogressively with time since fire, as surface cover evolved. \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\nIn both sites, the overall soil water repellency of the near surface measurements \n\nwas dominated throughout the 22 months post-fire study period by a very strong \n\nseverity level (median ethanol class 7; depth 2-3 cm). Consequently, the median \n\nfrequency of strong soil water repellency (SWR > 5 ethanol class) was around 65%. At \n\nthe same time, the volumetric soil moisture medians were also similar (7% at 2-3 cm \n\ndepth). Although overall soil moisture and water repellency levels were the same for \n\nboth sites, spatial variability between sites occurred, but it was irregular in time and \n\npoorly related to overall values. In spite of the overall predominance of very strong \n\nrepellency levels, non-repellent conditions also occurred, mainly after rainfall periods, \n\nwhen higher soil moisture was also recorded (Figure 3). During the first post-fire year, \n\nthe ploughed site registered more frequent hydrophobic conditions than the \n\nunploughed site (percentile 25 was 6 vs. 3 ethanol class, respectively). However, \n\nduring the second post-fire year, the ploughed site registered less hydrophobic \n\nconditions than the unploughed (percentile 25 was 0 vs. 4 ethanol class, respectively). \n\nHence, statistically significant differences between the sites\u2019 soil water repellency \n\nvariables were not found, besides some caution is required in the Wilcoxon\u2019s S\u2013R test \n\nresults analysis because the sites\u2019 sampling dates were not the same (Table 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Temporal patterns of rainfall, runoff and erosion rates \n\nOver the 22 months there were registered 254 rainfall events monitored in 72 \n\nweekly periods. Those events produced runoff in 65 weeks and sediments in 54 weeks \n\nat the unploughed site, whereas at the ploughed site they produced 59 weeks with \n\nrunoff and 48 with sediments.  \n\nRainfall amount and intensity presented a marked seasonal component in both \n\nstudied years. Even so, rainfall amount, intensity and their seasonal and monthly \n\nvariations were higher in the second year (Figure 4a), especially during the autumn \n\nwhere the highest rainfall volumes (around 300 mm per month) were measured and the \n\nI15 increased from the common maximum value of about 20 mm h\n-1 until 40-70 mm h-1.  \n\nTime since fire (month) was a significant factor for all the studied variables whereas \n\nsite differences were significant for all variables but organic matter fraction (Table 4). \n\nHowever, the runoff variables were more affected by time, whereas the erosion \n\nvariables showed a stronger site effect judging by the highest F values. Still, the \n\nsignificant interaction (site*month since fire) indicated that the site differences on runoff \n\nand erosion were not significant for all the months. The temporal trend in runoff and \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\nsediment production was not a simple decline with time since fire. Both runoff and \n\nerosion registered a high seasonal and monthly variation, with several peaks observed \n\none and two years after the fire related with rainfall variations and SWR conditions \n\n(Figure 4 and Figure 5). Following the highest rainfall amounts, runoff amount was \n\nhigher also during both autumn seasons. Similarly, runoff coefficient peaks were higher \n\nin the first autumn but not during the second autumn. On the other hand, in the first \n\nsummer high runoff coefficient peaks occurred with low rainfall and runoff amount. \n\nThese discrepancies between the peaks reached by runoff amount and coefficient \n\ncoincided with extreme rainfall conditions (high and low), and therefore with either very \n\nstrong soil water repellency or non repellent situations. During the wetter second \n\nautumn, the high rainfall amount (897 mm) generated a high total overland flow \n\n(averaging 130 mm) but the percentage converted to runoff (14%) was no higher than \n\nin other periods. In contrast, in the driest months of the first summer, rainfall (60 mm) \n\nand runoff amount (averaging 25 mm) were the lowest measured but the runoff \n\ncoefficient (45%) was higher than in the other periods. The SWR effect was also \n\nevident during the first rainfall storms after dry periods, when soil moisture was about \n\n5% (see Figure 3). The highest monthly runoff coefficient (50-60%) of October-05, \n\nSeptember-06 and June-07 coincided with mean extreme soil water repellency level (8 \n\nethanol class) and frequency of strong soil water repellency between 70-100%.  \n\nAdditionally, significant differences in overland flow generation between sites \n\ncoincided with differences between sites in soil water repellency levels. The analysis \n\nwith LS-means differences, identified the runoff response in the unploughed site \n\nsignificantly higher mainly during the second winter and spring (from January 2007 \n\nthroughout May 2007; Figure 4). At the same time, over that period, median repellency \n\nlevels and the frequency of strong soil water repellency were higher in unploughed site \n\neven when the soil moisture was lower (see Figure 3). \n\nTotal as well as specific sediment losses were significantly higher at the unploughed \n\ncompared to the ploughed site, except for a small period  when the erosion was low \n\nand therefore the differences between sites were not significant (Table 4; LS-means, \n\nFigure 5). Both erosion variables were significantly affected by time since fire, but not in \n\na unique way. On one hand, the time effect was greater for absolute values than for \n\nspecific rates (Table 4). On the other hand, sediment rates peaks were a follow-up of \n\nrunoff generation whereas in the case of specific sediment rate, they also coincided \n\nwith runoff coefficient peaks in the dry seasons as in the first summer.  Although annual \n\nspecific sediment losses indicated a significantly reduction in specific rates from the \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nfirst to the second year in both sites, the monthly values showed that peaks as high as \n\nin the first post-fire autumn happened in the second autumn (Figure 5). \n\n \n\n3.3 Relationship of runoff and erosion with key explanatory variables: \n\nThe multiple regression model results revealed that the set of used independent \n\nvariables accounted for 50% of variation in (log-transformed) runoff generation (Table \n\n5). Rainfall amount was the main factor explaining 27% variation, the influence of SWR \n\nwas reflected in the importance of the frequency of strong soil water repellency variable \n\n(Freq5; explaining 10% of runoff variation) and in the negative sign of the antecedent \n\nrainfall parameter estimate. The water retention capacity of litter and ash cover \n\nvariables was represented by their negative parameter estimates and explained around \n\n10% of runoff variation. The ploughed site regression analysis exhibited different \n\ncovariates compared to the general and the unploughed site model, showing I15 as the \n\nmain factor explaining 28% of runoff variation. Also in this site, the soil water repellency \n\ninfluence was slightly higher than in the unploughed site (12% vs. 7%), (Table 5). The \n\ndifferences in ground cover between sites were reflected in the site specific models; \n\nwhile the ash cover influence was higher in the unploughed site, the litter effect was \n\nonly visible in the ploughed site. \n\nThe I15 followed for cover related variables accounted for 30-50% variation in \n\n(fourth root) sediment losses (Table 5). Ground cover differences between sites were \n\nrepresented by the different importance of I15 and the cover related variables in the \n\nsites specific model. The lower model performance at the ploughed compared to the \n\nunploughed site (R2 0.45 vs. 0.57) may have caused by higher within-site variability on \n\nerosion rates, lower rates and a worse relationship between sediment losses and I15 at \n\nthe ploughed site (Figure 6a). In both sites, plots summing more than 70% of litter and \n\nvegetation cover hardly had high sediment rates (Figure 6b). The relationship of \n\nsediment losses with runoff generation was represented by the effect of some runoff \n\nrelated variables as soil moisture and Freq5. The effect of hydrophobicity in the \n\nploughed site was higher and represented by the influence of Freq5 (13%) on the \n\nsediment losses variation.  \n\nSince the Freq5 was a variable present in the runoff and sediment regression \n\nmodels, the data was divided in categories according to its frequency \n\n(SWR1=Freq5?32; SWR2=32<Freq5<66; SWR3= Freq5?66). The regression analysis \n\nwas done for those categories individually to better evaluate the soil water repellency \n\ninfluence (Table 5). A shift in the first variable to explain runoff generation from I15 to \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\nrainfall amount was detected as the soil water repellency increased. So, in the lowest \n\nsoil water repellency category, I15 was the main factor explaining 35% of runoff \n\nvariation. For the most repellent conditions, rainfall amount explained 45% and 27% of \n\nrunoff generation. At the same time, the influence of the cover variables with retention \n\ncapacity (litter + ash) diminished with the increase in soil water repellency conditions.  \n\n \n\n4. Discussion \n\n4.1. Overall runoff and erosion rates \n\nRelatively few reports exist concerning post-fire runoff and inter-rill erosion in \n\ncommercial eucalypt plantations. Comparison of this study results with other research \n\nin Portugal revealed that the first post-fire year runoff (22%) was similar to that of Prats \n\net al. (2012) (30%), both of which were higher than the range registered by Shakesby \n\net al. (1996) (4-16%). In terms of specific rates, the unploughed site rate (0.4 g m-2mm-1 \n\nrain) was similar to the one recorded by Prats et al. (2012) (0.33 g m-2mm-1 rain), both \n\nof which were comparable to the maximum values recorded by Shakesby et al. (1996) \n\n(0.07-0.34 g m-2mm-1 rain), while the ploughed site rate (0.12 g m-2mm-1 rain) was \n\ncomparable to their minimum values. The lower rainfall amounts in Shakesby et al. \n\n(1996) (645 mm), compared to Prats et al. (2012) (1684 mm) and this study (1048 mm) \n\nare probable related with those differences between studies. Also the latter studies \n\nused bigger plots (16m2) and generally, a reduction in runoff and erosion is expected \n\nas the contributing area increases (Le Bissonais et al., 1998; Bagarello and Ferro, \n\n2004; Boix-Fayos et al., 2006). However, a different trend can be detected depending \n\non the processes involved. The similarity of runoff and erosion data between the \n\npresent study and those of Shakesby et al. (1996) but specially those of Prats et al. \n\n(2012) suggested that inter-rill erosion was the main process in all of the three studies. \n\nBlong et al. (1982) and Dragovich and Morris (2002) carried out plot studies (8 m2) in \n\nrecently burnt eucalypt forest in Australia. They found specific sediment losses of 0.33 \n\nto 1.08 g m-2mm-1 rain. Only the highest sediment losses at the unploughed site (0.4 g \n\nm-2mm-1 rain) can be compared to their minimum rates. \n\nRunoff and erosion values at the unploughed site can be compared with other \n\nreported values for burnt eucalypt stands in the region, however when comparing with \n\nreported values outside Portugal the erosion figures only compare with the minimum \n\nvalues. The adjacent ploughed site presented comparable runoff amounts but lower \n\nsediment losses. Rip-ploughing (down-slope or contour) let the soil in a vulnerable \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\ncondition and a few storms can easily cause severe soil losses (Verheijen et al., 2009). \n\nIn fact, in a recently rip-ploughed eucalypt site, Shakesby et al. (1994) found specific \n\nsediment losses as high as 3.27 g m-2 mm-1 rain. Then, the erodibility should decrease \n\ngradually after the first events through selective removal of the fine soil fraction by \n\ninitial erosive events, the formation of a protective stone lag, and the subsequent \n\ndevelopment of vegetation and litter cover (Shakesby et al., 1994; Walsh et al., 1995). \n\nThe low sediment availability in the ploughed site of the present study, can be \n\nexplained by the time elapsed since ploughing (as much as 20 years or 2 eucalypt \n\nproduction cycles). At the same time, the low post-fire disturbance erosion figures \n\nindicate sediment exhaustion, at least of the finer particles than can be transported by \n\ninter-rill erosion at micro-plot scale. In commercial eucalypt stands, ground preparation \n\ninvolving uprooting the old stumps occurred at least every 30-40 years (3-4 eucalypt \n\ncycles) (Shakesby et al., 1996) and, in recent times, it is often done after fires. Since \n\nground preparation usually involves rip-ploughing and even terracing, sediment \n\nexhaustion at the ploughed site clearly shows the consequences and the threat for soil \n\nconservation of this type of management. On the other hand, Mediterranean erosion \n\nrates are generally lower than those in other areas; this is mainly attributed to the high \n\nsoil stoniness, shallow soils and long intensive land use (Cerdan et al., 2010; Shakesby \n\n2011). The lower erosion rates do not necessarily mean that erosion is a lesser threat \n\nfor the soil resource, as the soil is already thin and therefore any additional loss may be \n\nconsidered detrimental (Cerdan et al., 2010). Additionally, the systematically high \n\norganic matter fraction on the eroded sediments (40-50%) founded in the area \n\n(Thomas et al., 1999; Malvar et al., 2011; Malvar et al., 2011; Prats et al., 2012) \n\nindicates a loss of soil organic matter which may affect soil fertility (Thomas et al., \n\n1999) as well as caused off-site pollution (Spigel and Robichaud 2007; Vila-Escal\u00e9 et \n\nal., 2007; Campos et al. 2010). \n\n \n\n4.2. Key factors on hydrological and soil erosion response and its temporal \n\nvariation \n\nRainfall amount was the main factor explaining runoff generation, followed with \n\nequal importance by the ash plus litter cover and the frequency of strong soil water \n\nrepellency. The same factors were described by Prats et al., (2012) for untreated \n\n(eucalypt + pine) plots. A shift in the first descriptor from rainfall amount to 15-minutes \n\nrainfall intensity (I15) was detected from the unploughed site to the ploughed site model. \n\nIt was probably caused by the higher protective surface cover (litter + vegetation) in the \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\nploughed site (25% more). The higher importance of I15 as surface cover increased \n\nover the plots was also detected between the eucalypt and the pine plots with higher \n\nlitter cover of Prats et al. (2012). Equally, Vega et al. (2005), studying shrubs with a \n\nvegetation cover as high as 37% immediately after a prescribed fire, also found rainfall \n\nenergy (accumulated kinetic energy) to be the main factor for runoff generation \n\nfollowed by litter depth.  \n\nThe coverage of both litter and ashes (8% more in the ploughed than in the \n\nunploughed site) could explain about 10% reduction in runoff. Other authors have \n\nfound that the interception and storage capacity of both litter and ash layer have \n\nreduced overland flow (Shakesby et al., 1996; Leighton\u2013Boyce et al., 2007; Woods and \n\nBalfour 2008; Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2008; Bod\u00ed et al, 2011; Prats et al., 2012). Woods and \n\nBalfour 2008 attributed this retention to the highly porous nature of the ash layer, \n\nwhereas Leighton\u2013Boyce et al. (2007) suggested that the wettable patchy ash layer \n\nmay have provided some moisture storage. Bod\u00ed et al. (2011) demonstrated that ash is \n\nnot necessarily wettable, as widely assumed, but can be water repellent and therefore \n\nits effect over soil wettability will depend on the ash layer wettability. This study\u2019s \n\nmeasurements over the ash layer confirmed its wettability (the overall two post- fire \n\nyears\u2019 median was \u201c0\u201d ethanol class and percentile 75 was \u201c1\u201d ethanol class). \n\nThe effect of the spatial and seasonal variation of soil water repellency on runoff \n\ngeneration founded by other authors in the same region (Ferreira et al., 2000; Keizer \n\n2005a; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Malvar et al., 2011; Prats et al., 2012) was \n\ndetected in the general and site-specific runoff regression models. However, the spatial \n\nvariability of the soil water repellency was irregular in time and poorly related to overall \n\nvalues. Keizer et al. (2008), at the same sites and during the first post-fire year, \n\nfounded that the ploughed site exhibited greater repellency levels than the unploughed \n\nsite. Further analyses founded that the opposite was true for the second post-fire year. \n\nAt both sites, Keizer et al. (2008) confirmed a seasonal pattern of high repellency in dry \n\nperiods and reduced or no repellency following prolonged rainfall. The intensive \n\nmonitoring allowed distinctions in the key factors explaining runoff generation between \n\nthose soil water repellency conditions. Under no repellency, I15 was the main factor \n\ncontrolling overland flow with a great importance (21%) of the interception (litter+ ash) \n\nlayer. As repellency increased, the main factor changed from I15 to rainfall amount, and \n\nthe interception layer decreased in importance (7%). It can be stated that, under \n\nrepellent conditions, high rainfall volumes with medium I15 events were able to generate \n\nenough overland flow to transport sediments even with high protective cover. In \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\nunburnt eucalypt stands, Keizer et al., (2005a) suggests how the discrimination \n\nbetween (none to extreme) soil water repellency conditions could help to isolate the \n\neffect of repellency on overland flow generation. However, the soil water repellency \n\neffect was not straightforward, since exceptions of low runoff generation for high rainfall \n\namounts under high soil water repellency conditions were also measured. So, the \n\nrepellency measurement method is not accurate enough to fully capture the temporal-\n\nspatial dynamics. Keizer et al., (2008), detected significant increases and decreases in \n\nrepellency severity over time intervals as short as 6\u20137 days. Further studies will have to \n\nverify if a higher temporal resolution of water repellency measurements can help to \n\ndetermine a closer relationship with runoff response. Ideally, this should be done in \n\nconstant feedback with modelling approaches that considering temporal and spatial \n\nvariation in soil water repellency, in order to enhance model performance and point out \n\nthe necessary measurement resolution.  \n\nSediment losses were controlled by I15 followed by litter cover. Previous studies \n\nhave also reported the importance of rainfall intensity (Fernandez et al., 2004; Vega et \n\nal., 2005; Spigel and Robichaud 2007; Robichaud et al., 2008; Prats et al., 2012) and \n\nthe contribution of cover-related variables (Shakesby et al., 1996; Robichaud et al., \n\n2000; Wagenbrenner et al., 2006; Prats et al., 2012) in determining post-fire sediment \n\nlosses. Erosion was also related with the variables that affect runoff, i.e., soil water \n\nrepellency, soil moisture, and ash cover. Thus, the highest sediment losses did not \n\noccur only in the first months after fire (when the protective cover categories were the \n\nlowest), but also in the second post-fire year autumn when the I15 was higher or \n\ncoinciding with runoff coefficient peaks following the dry seasons. \n\n \n\n4.3. Natural vs. simulated rainfall  \n\nMalvar et al. (2011) carried out repeated rainfall simulation experiments (RSE\u2019s) at \n\nthe same unploughed and ploughed eucalypt stands. 46 RSE\u2019s were performed, \n\napplying two rainfall intensities: high intensity with 45-50 mm h-1 (n= 12 in each site) \n\nand extreme intensity with 80-85 mm h-1 (n= 12 at the unploughed and n=10 at the \n\nploughed site). The RSE\u2019s were executed in six successive field campaigns during the \n\nfirst two years following wildfire, using the same plot type, size (0.28 m2), number and \n\nslope position than the present natural rainfall study. Therefore, the present runoff and \n\nerosion results can be used to address the representativeness of the RSE-data of \n\nMalvar et al. (2011) for natural rainfall conditions.  Inherent differences between the \n\nmeasurement techniques were the lower rainfall amount and kinetic energy in the \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\nRSE\u2019s. Oppositely, the maximum intensity recorded in a natural event (24 mm h-1 with \n\nan I15=33 mm h\n-1) was much lower than the simulated rainfall intensity (45-85 mm h-1). \n\nRSE\u2019s intensities were only comparable to the two maximum I15 recorded (I15=44 mm h\n-\n\n1 and I15=71 mm h\n-1) at two single occasions.  \n\nDifferences between the results were lower in terms of runoff response than \n\nsediment losses. In the unploughed site, the simulated rainfall was 70% lower than \n\nnatural, generating 36% less runoff amount and 90% less sediment losses. In the \n\nploughed site, 75% less rainfall originated 54% less runoff amount and 83% less \n\nsediment losses with simulated than with natural rainfall. Relative variables (runoff \n\ngeneration coefficient and specific sediment losses) were more appropriate to compare \n\nboth methods. The average runoff coefficient generated by the RSE\u2019s (45%) was \n\ndouble than that under natural rainfall (22%). However, specific sediment rates \n\nremained comparable with the two techniques (Figure 7). In the unploughed site, \n\nspecific sediment losses under natural rainfall (0.35 g m-2 mm-1 rain) were double than \n\nthose with high intensity RSE\u2019s (0.16 m-2 mm-1 rain) but very similar to those from \n\nextreme intensity RSE\u2019s (0.31 g m-2 mm-1 rain). This means that the 12 extreme \n\nintensity RSE\u2019s executed in six campaigns during two post-fire years, were able to \n\ncapture the same erosion rates than those of 4 natural rainfall micro-plots monitored \n\nduring the same period (254 events monitored in 71 weekly periods). In the ploughed \n\nsite, the natural rainfall micro-plots produced 0.06 g m-2 mm-1 rain whereas high (n=12) \n\nand extreme (n=10) intensity RSE\u2019s produced 0.08 g m-2 mm-1 rain. The absence of \n\ndifferences in specific sediment losses between both techniques was probably due to \n\nsediment exhaustion several years after it was ploughed. Independently of the \n\ntechnique or site, the organic matter fraction on the eroded sediments was around 40-\n\n50% with the implications above mentioned of such a high organic matter loss. In \n\nsummary, the main similarities between both techniques were:  \n\n(i) The RSE\u2019s represented relatively well specific erosion rates, organic matter \n\nfraction losses and differences between sites. Both natural and artificial rainfall \n\nindicated that the ploughed site had comparable runoff amounts but less sediment \n\nlosses than the unploughed site. However, the fact that only extreme intensity RSE\u2019s \n\nwere able to capture the erosion figures in the unploughed site created uncertainty \n\nabout the fitting of the RSE\u2019s methodology in sites with higher erosion rates.  \n\n(ii) The significant effect of time since fire on runoff and sediment losses had been \n\ncaptured by natural rainfall monitoring as well as repeated RSE\u2019s methodology. On one \n\nhand, both micro-plot scale techniques detected the role of topsoil water repellency in \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\nenhancing overland flow generation under dry antecedent weather conditions. On the \n\nother hand, runoff and sediment losses measurements as high as one month after the \n\nfire were also measured two years after the fire using both methodologies. \n\n \n\n5. Conclusions \n\nRunoff and sediment losses were measured in two burnt eucalypt sites, with \n\ndifferent pre-fire management (unploughed and down-slope rip-ploughed), during two \n\npost-fire years using micro-plots (0.28 m2), the main conclusions are the following: \n\nThe runoff response was consistently around 20% of the rainfall, independently of \n\nthe site and post-fire year; this was comparable to other studies in the region. The \n\nerosive response of the unploughed site (4.15 Mg ha-1 year-1) was comparable to other \n\nMediterranean studies, but it was very low for the ploughed site (1.25 Mg ha-1 year-1), \n\nprobably due to the limited sediment supply. The time elapsed since ploughing can \n\nexplain the lower sediment availability and sediment exhaustion. Ploughing increased \n\nwithin-site variability in sediment rates, probably by enhancing specific-plot variability. \n\nThe measured sediment exhaustion at the ploughed site should consider ploughing as \n\nan additional risk for forest soils in this area, especially since ploughing and slope \n\nengineering (terracing), in both recently burnt and unburnt eucalypt stands, are \n\nincreasingly more frequent in the region. Independently of the management, the \n\norganic matter fraction was around 40-50% of the eroded sediments. Despite the low \n\nmeasured erosion rates, the high overland flow generation highlighted the possible \n\npost-fire erosion risk. The importance of that risk should be considered due to the poor \n\nsoils in this area, the historical and present intensive land use, as well as the \n\nimportance of organic matter fraction on the eroded sediments.  \n\nTime since fire had a significant effect over runoff and sediment production. \n\nHowever, the observed temporal trend in runoff and sediment production was not a \n\nsimple decline with time since fire, but had a marked seasonal component. High runoff \n\nand erosion peaks were measured two years after fire. This was mainly related to the \n\nrole of soil water repellency in enhancing overland flow. Nevertheless, a moderate \n\ndecline in specific sediment rates was observed. \n\nPost-fire overland flow was controlled first by rainfall amount, followed with a \n\nsimilar contribution of surface cover and topsoil water repellency. However, site and \n\ntemporal characteristics did influence that relationship. When either a protective \n\nsurface cover (vegetation + litter) or some infiltration capacity (hydrophilic conditions) \n\n\n\n98 \n \n\nwere present, there was detected a shift from rainfall amount to I15 as main factor \n\ncontrolling runoff generation. Independently of the site and/or temporal variation, \n\nsediment losses were controlled by the I15 followed by cover related variables. \n\nVariables that were proved to affect runoff (soil water repellency, soil moisture, ash \n\nlayer) were also related to sediment losses. \n\nThe natural rainfall results confirmed that rainfall simulation experiences (RSE\u2019s) \n\nproduced higher runoff coefficient but were able to capture the specific sediment losses \n\nand its organic matter content as well as differences between the ploughed and \n\nunploughed sites. The methodology of repeated RSE\u2019s also captured the role of soil \n\nwater repellency in enhance runoff and subsequent sediment losses following the dry \n\nseasons, even two years after the fire. Soil erosion models will need to consider the \n\nrole of soil water repellency in enhancing post-fire runoff. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n The present study was carried out in the framework of the PhD research \n\nfellowship of MMC (SFRH/BD/41320/2007) with support of the EROSFIRE project \n\n(POCI/AGR/60354/2004) and research grant of SPA (SFRH/BD/33392/2008) and \n\nJPCN (SFRH/BPD/39721/2007) all funded by the Foundation for Science and \n\nTechnology (FCT) of Portugal with co-funding by FEDER through the POCI2010 \n\nProgramme.

Post-fire soil erosion control measures are intended to minimize this response and\nfacilitate ecosystem recovery. In a few recent cases, hydromulch has been applied, and this consists of a mixture of organic fibers, water and seeds.\nThe objectives of this research were to (i) analyze the effectiveness of hydromulch in reducing post-fire runoff and sediment production and\n(ii) determine the underlying processes and mechanisms that control post-fire runoff and erosion. After a wildfire occurred in August 2008,\n14 plots ranging in size from 0\u00b725 to 10m2 were installed on a 25 degree slope in a burnt pine plantation that had also been subjected to salvage\nlogging. Half of the plots were randomly selected and treated with hydromulch. One of two slope strips adjacent to the plots was also hydromulched\nand used for monitoring some soil properties. Measurements made in each of the first 3years following the wildfire included (i) the plot-scale runoff\nvolumes and sediment yields; (ii) soil shear strength, soil moisture, and soil water repellency; and (iii) surface cover. The hydromulch reduced over-\nland flow volume by 70% and soil erosion by 83%. The decrease in runoff was attributed to the increase in soil water retention capacity and the\ndecrease in soil water repellency, whereas the reduction in soil erosion was initially attributed to the protective cover provided by the hydromulch\nand lately to an enhanced vegetative regrowth in the third year after burning.

The consumption of the vegetation and litter layer\nby fire increases both overland flow\u2014because of the\nreduction of rainfall interception and resistance to flow\u2014\nand sediment losses by increasing the splash erosion by rain-\ndrops (Soto &amp; Diaz-Fierros, 1997; Llorens &amp; Domingo,\n2006). Additionally, the fire-induced heating of the soil can\nreduce aggregate stability, decrease porosity, and increase soil\nwater repellency (SWR), and these changes can decrease\ninfiltration and increase soil erodibility (DeBano, 2000;\nFerreira et al., 2008; Keizer et al., 2008; Malvar et al., 2011;\nPrats et al., 2012).\nThe association of wildfire with on-site soil erosion and\n\ndownstream flooding and massive sediment deposition has\nbecome increasingly recognized (Kraebel, 1934) and, in\nthe early part of the last century, led to the first systematic\nsoil erosion control treatments following wildfires (Munns,\n1919). The first post-fire rehabilitation efforts consisted of\n\nbuilding engineering structures (check dams) in stream\nchannels to trap the sediments and of seeding hillslopes to\nincrease ground cover (Wohlgemuth et al., 2009). However,\nit was proved to be unrealistic to build check dams in the\nshort periods between the occurrence of the wildfires and\nthe occurrence of the erosion-producing rains; also, various\nstudies started to question the effectiveness of seeding to\nreduce soil erosion during the 1980s (Gautier, 1983; Taskey\net al., 1989).\nDuring the 1990s and the 2000s, research on post-fire\n\nerosion mitigation concerned seeding (e.g., Pinaya et al.,\n2000; Fern\u00e1ndez-Abascal et al., 2003; Beyers, 2004;\nRobichaud et al., 2006; Groen &amp; Woods, 2008; Peppin\net al., 2010), construction of erosion barriers by using logs\n(Wagenbrenner et al., 2006; Robichaud et al., 2008), and\nstraw mulching (Bautista et al., 1996; Bad\u00eda &amp; Mart\u00ed,\n2000; Wagenbrenner et al., 2006). In a nutshell, these\nstudies found seeding to be effective in some cases but not\nin others, log erosion barriers to be ineffective unless\nrain events are few and small, and mulching to be\nhighly effective. The effectiveness of mulching was also\nwell-established for agriculture lands (Harris &amp; Yao,\n1923; Meyer et al., 1970; Lyles et al., 1974; Meyer et al.,\n1999; Wilson et al., 2004; Garc\u00eda-Orenes et al., 2009,\n2010; Gim\u00e9nez-Morera et al., 2010; Jord\u00e1n et al., 2010),\ncut slopes, and unpaved roads (Grismer &amp; Hogan, 2005;\nJord\u00e1n &amp; Zavala, 2008).\nPost-fire straw mulching at rates of c.a. 2 Mg ha?1 has\n\nbeen proved to reduce sediment yields by more than 80%\n\n*Correspondence to: S.

However, straw may be\navailable in only limited quantities in certain regions,\nincluding Portugal (Prats et al., 2012), and may be\nredistributed by strong winds as a result of its low weight\n(Robichaud et al., 2000). Straw application can also\nintroduce invasive weeds and inhibit native species recovery\n(Kruse et al., 2004). Despite the increased application costs,\nother mulches of higher specific weight have also been\ntested. Forest residues, at application rates of 8 Mg ha?1 in\nPrats et al. (2012) and 46 Mg ha?1 in Shakesby et al.\n(1996), or wood strands mulch, at rates of 4\u201312 Mg ha ?1\n\nin Robichaud et al. (2013a), were found to be as effective\nas straw mulch, whereas wood chips mulch was found to\nbe much less effective (Kim et al., 2008; Fern\u00e1ndez\net al., 2011).\nMulching is effective against erosion because it\n\nreduces runoff and erosion rates by two mechanisms.\nFirst, it increases interception storage capacity, which\nreduces the amount of rain available for producing\nrunoff, it reduces runoff velocity, and it increases soil\nmoisture (Bautista et al., 2009). Second, mulch protects\nthe soil surface against the kinetic energy of rainfall\ndrops and decreases the hydrodynamic power of flowing\nwater (Smets et al., 2008).\nA recent variant of mulching is that of hydromulching,\n\nwhich refers to the application of a water-based mixture\nof organic fibers, seeds and a green colorant. It is easily\napplied because it can be sprayed onto slopes by a jet hose\n(Naveh, 1975). It also tends to bind strongly to the soil\nsurface by the action of the soil-binding agent, so it is\nparticularly useful on steep slopes and strongly modified\nareas such as quarries, construction sites, and cut and fill\nslopes along roads (Emanual, 1976; Benik et al., 2003;\nRobichaud et al., 2010). Runoff and soil erosion will be\nreduced because the hydromulch increases interception\nstorage and protects the soil surface. Additionally, the\nintroduced seeds are intended to increase the vegetative\ncover, especially when the mulch starts decompose. In\nburnt areas, seeding requires careful selection of species\nthat are adapted to the target environment, both to guaran-\ntee that the seeding produces an adequate cover and to\navoid that the introduced species come to behave as inva-\nsive weed (Kruse et al., 2004). An important disadvantage\nof hydromulching is its elevated costs, which can range\nfrom $3,700.00 to $10,300.00 per ha for aerial application\n(Hubbert et al., 2012). By contrast, the costs for straw\nmulching are on the order of $600.00 and $1,200.00 per\nha for application by helicopter and by hand-spreading,\nrespectively (Napper, 2006). Despite this greater expense,\nhydromulching has been used especially in the USA after\nsome fires when access was difficult, the slopes were too\nsteep or subject to wind to use straw mulch and when\nthere were particularly important \u2018values at risk\u2019, such as\nwater reservoirs, cultural or natural heritage sites, or\nindustrial plants.\n\nThe effectiveness of hydromulching in reducing post-fire\nrunoff and erosion has not yet been fully established.\nAlthough Robichaud et al. (2013b) found no marked\ndecrease in post-fire runoff, Hubbert et al. (2012), Rough\n(2007), and Robichaud et al. (2010, 2013a) did report\nsubstantial reductions in erosion rates (with 65\u201395%).\nHowever, these reductions were restricted to the first year\nafter hydromulching, which the authors attributed to the\nrapid breakdown of the mulch layer. Wohlgemuth et al.\n(2011) also found hydromulching to markedly reduce\noverall erosion rates (by 60\u201380%) but not the sediment\nlosses produced by high-intensity storms. Robichaud et al.\n(2010) suggested that hydromulching would be most effec-\ntive on short slopes (10\u201320 m), where interrill erosion is\nthe dominant process and the hydromulch mat is less likely\nto be detached by rill incision. However, Rough (2007)\nfound aerial hydromulching to be highly effective on long\nhillslopes with elevated rill densities (0\u00b71 rill m?2).\nGiven the elevated potential of hydromulching for post-\n\nfire rehabilitation, there is a clear need to test its effective-\nness in geographical regions outside the USA. Although\nhydromulch can include surfactants, the effectiveness of\nhydromulching has been poorly assessed for vegetation\ntypes associated with strong or extreme SWR, such as the\neucalypt and pine plantations that dominate in north-central\nPortugal (Ferreira et al., 2008, Keizer et al., 2008; Prats\net al., 2012). Also, the effectiveness of hydromulching after\npost-fire salvage logging is poorly known in spite of being\nperhaps the most common practice following wildfires in\nnorth-central Portugal. Salvage logging was typically being\nused to recover timber values and reduce the risk of insect\ninfestation (McIver &amp; Starr, 2000), but it can trigger runoff\nand soil erosion through soil alteration and forest floor\ndisturbances (Rab, 1994; Castillo et al., 1997; Edeso et al.,\n1999; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2004, 2007).\nThe overall aim of the present research was to study the\n\neffectiveness of hydromulching to reduce runoff and\nerosion over a three-year period in a recently burnt and\nlogged pine plantation in north-central Portugal. The\nspecific objectives were to (i) assess the effectiveness of\nhydromulching in reducing runoff volumes and sediment\nyields at the plot scale; (ii) analyze the changes in runoff\nand soil erosion over time and across plot size (0\u00b725, 0\u00b75,\nand 10 m2 plots); and (iii) determine the effect of\nhydromulching on key soil properties, surface cover, and\nvegetative recovery, and the extent to which these\nmulching-induced changes can explain the observed differ-\nences in runoff and erosion between the hydromulched and\nuntreated plots.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nStudy Area and Site\n\nThis study was conducted near the village of Colmeal in the\nG\u00f3is municipality of north-central Portugal (N 40\u00ba08?42?, W\n7\u00ba59?16?; 490 m asl). On 27 August 2008, a wildfire burnt\n68 ha of forest lands. A west-facing 25 degree steep hillslope\n\nS. A. PRATS ET AL.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. LAND DEGRADATION &amp; DEVELOPMENT, (2013)\n\n\n\nwas selected to study post-fire vegetation recovery (Maia\net al., 2012a, 2012b), and, at a later stage, also for this study.\nThe hillslope had been planted with maritime pine (Pinus\npinaster Ait.) some 25 years before the wildfire, at a density\nof 2,600 saplings per ha. The undergrowth was composed of\na mixture of Mediterranean and Atlantic shrubs and was\ndominated by Calluna vulgaris I. and Arbutus unedo L.\n(Maia et al., 2012b). The study area has a Mediterranean\nclimate with a mean annual temperature of 10\u201312\u00b75\u00b0C\n(according to K\u00f6ppen; APA, 2011). The annual precipita-\ntion as recorded by the nearest weather station (Cadafaz, N\n40\u00ba08?02?, W 8\u00ba32?40?; 12 km W?1 from the study area;\n25 years of data) was, on average, 1,130 mm but varied from\n717 mm to 1,872 mm (SNIRH, 2012). The soils were\nshallow, 30- to 35-cm deep Humic Cambisols (WRB,\n2007), overlying schist, as was observed from four soil pits\ndug during November 2008 (Table I). A soil sample was\ncollected at 0\u20135 cm depth in each pit, and later analyzed,\nusing standard laboratory methods, for bulk density (Porta\net al., 2003), porosity, and grain-size distribution (Guitian\n&amp; Carballas, 1976). Percent organic carbon was determined\nby a carbon analyzer (Flash EA 1112 series by Thermo\nFinnigan, USA) and multiplied by the van Bemmelen factor\n(1\u00b7724) in order to obtain the organic matter content on the\nsoil (Jackson, 1958).\n\nExperimental Design, Field Data Collection, and\nLaboratory Analyses\n\nAt the location selected for this experiment, the 2008\nwildfire had completely consumed the pine crowns, so\n\nthere was basically no needle cast after the fire (Table I).\nOn 11 December 2008, 106 days after the fire, more than\nhalf of the soil surface corresponded to black ashes, a\nthird to stones, and less than 10% to bare soil. The fire\nseverity was classified as moderate according to various\nseverity indices described in Maia et al. (2012b) at\nlocations some 5\u201310 m distance from the present experi-\nment. For example, the maximum temperature reached\n(Guerrero et al., 2007) by the soil at 0\u20133 cm depth, esti-\nmated with near-infrared spectroscopy, was, on average,\n78\u00b0C; the twig diameter index ( Maia et al., 2012a),\nwhich ranged between 0 (unburnt) and 1 (very intense\nwildfire) was, on average, 0\u00b74 (Table I).\nBecause the National Forestry Authority had decided to\n\nlog the stand as soon as possible because of the risk of\nnematode infestation, the experimental set up of this study\ninvolved four phases. The first phase comprised the installa-\ntion of a tipping-bucket rain gage (Pronamic professional\nrain gauge with an event logger) in combination with a\nstorage gage for validation purposes. This was carried out\non 15 September 2008, prior to any rainfall following\nthe wildfire. After that, the rainfall was measured weekly\nfrom the storage gage, and the maximum weekly or\nmonthly 30-min rainfall intensity (\u2018I30\u2019, in mm h?1)\nwas calculated for each period from the tipping-bucket\nrain gage data series.\nOn 5 November 2008, the pretreatment period started\n\nwith the installation of four plots bounded with metal sheets.\nTwo were micro-plots of approximately 0\u00b75 \u00d7 0\u00b75 m,\nwhereas the other two were small plots of approximately\n0\u00b75 m wide and 1\u00b70 m long. The outlets of each plot were\nconnected, using garden hose, to 30 L tanks, where the run-\noff was collected. The runoff volume in each tank was mea-\nsured at 1- to 2-weekly intervals, depending on rainfall, from\n5 November 2008 to 12 October 2010, except during March\n2008 when the runoff measurements had to be interrupted\nbecause of the logging activities. This 23-month period\nwas divided in a pretreatment and posttreatment period, as\nfurther specified in Table II. Whenever runoff exceeded\n250 ml, a sample was collected for determination of\nsediment and organic matter contents by using standard\nlaboratory methods (filtration at 14 ?m, drying for 24 h at\n105\u00b0C and loss-on-ignition for 4 h at 550\u00b0C; APHA, 1998).\nThe third phase began on 30 March 2009, after the log-\n\nging had been completed, when two more micro-plots\nand two more small plots were installed at close distances\nfrom the previous micro-plots (<5 m) along with six sedi-\nment fences (Robichaud &amp; Brown, 2002) that had been\nset up at some 10\u201320 m distance in the upslope direction.\nFollowing the design by Fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2011), these\nsediment fence plots (\u2018SF plots\u2019) of roughly 2-m wide\nand 5-m long were bounded by means of a geotextile fabric\nand delimited by metal sheets to avoid run-on into the\nplots. The geotextile fabric filtered the runoff, and only\nthe sediments accumulated at the bottom of the SF plots\nwere collected at monthly intervals from 31 March 2009\nto 12 October 2010. Afterwards, the SF plots were emptied\n\nTable I.

LAND DEGRADATION &amp; DEVELOPMENT, (2013)\n\n\n\non a single occasion, on 28 November 2011, comprising\nthe fourth phase of this study. The collected sediments\nwere later analyzed for their moisture and organic matter\ncontents by using standard laboratory methods (drying for\n24 h at 105\u00b0C and loss-on-ignition for 4 h at 550\u00b0C;\nAPHA, 1998).\nOn 31 March 2009, the hydromulch was applied to two of\n\nthe four micro-plots, two of the four small plots, and three of\nthe six SF plots, all of which were selected randomly. In\naddition, it was applied to one of two adjacent soil strips\nof 5-m wide and 10-m long, which had been delineated for\nmonitoring of selected soil properties by using destructive\ntechniques. The hydromulch was provided and applied by\nSerraic, Lda. by using a jet hose operated by a person on\nfoot. It consisted of an aqueous mixture of wood fibers,\nseeds, a surfactant, nutrients, a natural bio-stimulant and a\ngreen colorant applied at a nominal ratio of 3.5 Mg ha-1.\nThe formulation is confidential, but the company guaranteed\nthat the components are nontoxic for humans or the environ-\nment. The seed composition was also confidential, but\ndetailed descriptions of the floristic composition in the SF\nplots suggested that it included grass (e.g., Lolium perenne L.)\nas well as shrub species [Cytisus striatus (Hill), Ulex\nminor Roth.].\nGround cover was measured at seven occasions be-\n\ntween 31 March 2009 and 12 October 2010 and finally\non 11 November 2011. The ground cover was recorded\nat each intersection point of a 5 \u00d7 5-cm grid in the case\nof the micro-plots and small plots, and of a 10 \u00d7 10-cm\ngrid in the case of the SF plots, that is, at 100, 200, and\n400 points, respectively. Each recording involved classify-\ning the ground cover according to seven categories: stones\n\nbigger than 2 mm (\u2018Stone\u2019), bare soil (\u2018Bare\u2019), ashes\n(\u2018Ash\u2019), litter (\u2018Litter\u2019), hydromulch (\u2018Hm\u2019), native\nvegetation (\u2018Natveg\u2019), and vegetation introduced by\nhydromulch (\u2018Introveg\u2019). The data also were grouped into\ntwo lumped categories: total vegetation (\u2018Tveg\u2019) and total\nprotective ground cover (\u2018Hlv\u2019), with the latter being the\nsum of hydromulch, litter, and vegetation.\nThe soil strips were sampled at monthly intervals from\n\n22 April 2009 to 11 August 2010 for a total of 17 occa-\nsions. Sampling involved destructive measurements of soil\nshear strength, using a torvane (vane tester, Eijkelkamp),\nand of SWR, using the molarity ethanol drop (Doerr,\n1998). At the bottom of each 50 m2-strip, 15 equally\nspaced measurements were made along a horizontal tran-\nsect, and this transect was then shifted approximately\n0\u00b75 m upslope for the next sampling occasion. Before mea-\nsuring shear strength or repellency, any hydromulch,\nstones, litter, or ashes were removed. The molarity ethanol\ndrop test was slightly modified in accordance with our\nprior studies (e.g., Keizer et al., 2005a, 2005b, 2008). In\nthis study, three drops of pure water were applied to the\nsoil surface, and, if two of the three drops did not infiltrate\nwithin 5 s, three drops with successively higher ethanol\nconcentrations were applied until two of the three drops\ninfiltrated within 5 s. The nine ethanol concentrations used\nwere 0, 1, 3, 5, 8\u00b75, 13, 18, 24, and 36%. In data analysis,\nthe overall median of the relative frequency of any ethanol\nconcentrations higher than 0%, calculated over the total\nmeasurements in each strip, was called SWR frequency.\nVolumetric soil moisture content was monitored at a\n\ndepth of 0\u20135 cm at eight locations: four within the untreated\nSF plots and four within the hydromulched SF plots.

A. PRATS ET AL.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. LAND DEGRADATION &amp; DEVELOPMENT, (2013)\n\n\n\nwas carried out using eight EC-5 sensors linked to two\nEm5b data loggers (Decagon Devices, Inc.) and recording\ndata at 10 min intervals. For each read-out period, initial soil\nmoisture content (\u2018Sm\u2019) was calculated as the soil moisture\nat the start of the largest rainfall event during that 1- to 2-\nweekly period by using the data of the automatic rainfall\ngage to identify this event.\n\nData Analysis\n\nFor the statistical analyses described in the succeeding text,\nrunoff volumes and (specific) soil losses were fourth-root\ntransformed so that the residuals did not fail the assumption\nof normality according to the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test at\n? ? 0\u00b705, whereas runoff coefficients were square-root\ntransformed for the same reason. Furthermore, 16 read-outs\nwith low rainfall amounts (less than 6 mm) had to be\nremoved from the data set to prevent non-normality of the\nresiduals.\nThe effects of hydromulching, plot size, and time-since-\n\nhydromulching on the dependent variables (runoff volume,\nrunoff coefficient, soil losses, specific soil losses, and\norganic matter content of the eroded sediments) were\nassessed by means of a three-way repeated measures analy-\nsis of variance (ANOVA) (Ott &amp; Longnecker, 2001). The\nvariance\u2013covariance structure of each dependent variable\nwas selected according to the lowest values of the Akaike\ninformation criterion and the restricted maximum likelihood\n(REML) fit (Littell et al., 2006). The heterogeneous first-\norder auto-regressive variance\u2013covariance structure was\nselected for all dependent variables except runoff coefficient,\nfor which a spatial power structure was selected. In addition,\nspecific contrasts between the treated and control plots, for\neach individual read-out as well as between the three plot\nsizes, were tested by means of the least squares means and\nadjusted by the Tukey\u2013Kramer method (Kramer, 1956).\nRepeated measures ANOVA was also used to test the treat-\nment and time effects on the seven ground cover categories\nand the initial soil moisture content. In the case of soil\nresistance and SWR frequency, however, the treatment effect\n\ncould only be tested using a nonparametric test, that is, the\nMann\u2013Whitney U-test (? ? 0\u00b705).\nStepwise multiple linear regressions using the REG\n\nprocedure in SAS (Littell et al., 1996) were used to determine\nhow well the weekly runoff volumes (n = 35) and the\nmonthly soil losses (n = 17) could be explained by a set of\nindependent variables. These variables were selected\nsequentially in a forward selection procedure, in order of\ndecreasing significance by using a minimum p value of\n0\u00b705. The 16 independent variables were plot size (\u2018Plotsz\u2019),\nrainfall amount (\u2018Rain\u2019), 30-min maximum rainfall intensity\n(\u2018I30\u2019), days since the last rainy day (\u2018Drain\u2019), the seven\nindividual (\u2018Stone\u2019, \u2018Bare\u2019, \u2018Ash\u2018, \u2018Litter\u2018, \u2018Hm\u2019, \u2018Natveg\u2019,\nand \u2018Introveg\u2019), the two lumped categories (\u2018Tveg\u2019 and\n\u2018Hlv\u2019), soil shear strength (\u2018Storv\u2019), SWR frequency, and\ninitial soil moisture content (\u2018Sm\u2019).

Even\nthough this study did not commence until 8 December\n2008 and had to be interrupted, because of the salvage\nlogging, during March 2009, the present analysis covered\nalmost 90% of the rainfall during the first post-fire year\n(891 mm; Figure 1). From these 891 mm, 609 mm fell before\nthe logging and the hydromulch application (designated here\nas \u2018pretreatment period\u2019), and 282 were measured until the\nend of post-fire year 1. The highest rainfall amounts were\nmeasured during winter, in January 2009 and 2010 with\n244 and 262 mm, respectively.

LAND DEGRADATION &amp; DEVELOPMENT, (2013)\n\n\n\npost-fire year, during May 2009 and September 2009 with\nmaximum I30 of 29 mm h?1 and 21 mm h?1. During the\nsecond post-fire year, I30s of 15 mm h?1 occurred at least\nonce a month from October 2009 to April 2010.\n\nGround Cover\n\nAt the start of this study, in December 2008, half of the soil\nsurface was covered by ashes, and less than 10% was bare\n(Figure 2; Table I). By 26 March 2009, after the logging\nhad been completed, ash cover had decreased to 28%, the\nbare soil cover had increased to 17%, and the stones had\nbecome the predominant cover category with, on average,\n42%. The recovery of the vegetation was very slow on the\ncontrol plots, as vegetative cover continued to be near zero\n1 year after the fire (August 2009), but reached 30% after\nthe second year (October 2010) and a mere 36% at the\nbeginning of the fourth post-fire year (November 2011).\nImmediately after its application, on 31 March 2009, the\nhydromulch provided a cover of 80% on average, but this\ncover was significantly higher at the two micro-plots and\ntwo small plots (90% \u00b1 4%) than at the three SF plots\n(64% \u00b1 2) (ANOVA, p &lt;0\u00b705). This difference was no\nlonger significant after five months (August 2009), even\nthough the hydromulch cover continued higher at the four\nrunoff plots (64% \u00b1 12) than at the three SF plots (47% \u00b1 7;\nANOVA, p = 0\u00b706). There was a marked decrease (5\u00b73%\nper month) in the average of the hydromulch cover during\nthe first 5 months after its application. After 1 year from\nthe application (1 April 2010), the hydromulch cover\ndecreased to 27% on average (an annual decay rate of\n4\u00b76% per month). This decrease in hydromulch cover was,\nby and large, compensated by an increase in protective soil\ncover due to the native and introduced vegetation (including\nthe litter it produced). The cover of the introduced vegeta-\ntion was at its maximum (22%) in June 2010 and became\npractically zero by November 2011. The native vegetation\nrecovered slowly on the hydromulched plots as well but by\n\nNovember 2011 did attain a clearly higher cover than at\nthe control plots (52% vs. 36%). The total protective ground\ncover (lumped into the \u2018hlv\u2019 category) was around 75%\nthrough all the post-treatment period. When the stone cover\nis included, a protective layer consistently covered 90% of\nthe surface.\n\nSoil Properties\n\nThe monthly values of soil shear strength, frequency of\nSWR, as well as the soil moisture content over the post-\ntreatment period are depicted in Figure 3. The three\nvariables oscillated across the monitoring period according\nto the rainfall amounts. Soil shear strength and soil moisture\nvaried in the wake of the rainfall variations. By contrast,\nSWR showed the lowest values during the rainiest months.\nOverall, soil resistance to detachment was lower at the\n\nuntreated than treated strip (2\u00b74 \u00b1 0\u00b77 kg cm?2 vs.\n2\u00b78 \u00b1 0\u00b75 kg cm?2; U-test: Z = ?5\u00b704; p &lt;0\u00b701). Shear\nstrength was clearly lowest at the control strip during 12\nout of 17 months as opposed to 2 months at the\nhydromulched strip, when shear strength was also greater\nthan during the remaining months.\nThe hydromulched strip, overall, was less repellent than\n\nthe control (15% vs. 35% SWR frequency; U-test:\nZ = ?6\u00b707; p &lt;0\u00b701) and consequently had higher soil mois-\nture (18\u00b71% volume \u00b1 9\u00b77 vs. 14\u00b73% \u00b1 6\u00b77; ANOVA: F = 7;\np &lt;0\u00b705). In certain periods, however, the opposite was true,\nas is well-illustrated by Figure 3. In the case of soil moisture\ncontent, these periods were confined to the dry season of\nsummer 2009; in the case of SWR, it also happened during\nsummer 2010.\n\nOverall Runoff and Soil Losses\n\nRoughly half of the rainfall was converted into runoff on\nthe control plots (Table II).

These\ndifferences coincided with the variations in rainfall amount.\nHowever, the same was not true in the case of soil losses.\nThe control plots produced, on average, 86 g m?2 during the\npre-treatment period, 217 g m?2 during the post-treatment\nperiod of the first post-fire year, and 361 g m?2 during the\nsecond post-fire year. There was a fivefold increase in the spe-\ncific soil losses between the pre-treatment and post-treatment\nperiods (from 0\u00b714 to 0\u00b777 g m?2 mm rain?1), and after that,\nthe specific soil losses decreased progressively until reaching\nvalues similar to those prior to the logging during the third\nyear (0\u00b716 g m?2 mm rain?1; Table II).\n\nHydromulching was highly effective in reducing overland\nflow, with, on average, 56% during the first post-fire year\nand even 78% during the subsequent year (Table II).\nHydromulching effectiveness in decreasing soil losses\nexceeded the effectiveness at reducing overland flow to a\nmarked extent, amounting to 83% during both years. During\nthe third post-fire year, however, the effectiveness in\nmitigating erosion reduced to 56%.

LAND DEGRADATION &amp; DEVELOPMENT, (2013)\n\n\n\nin the case of runoff coefficient (F value of 176) and less\nimportant in the case of the organic matter content (F = 9).\nThe strong treatment effect, especially in the case of runoff\ncoefficient as highlighted by the big F value (176),\ncontrasted with the lack of effect of the plot size.\nIn Figure 4 it can be observed that the differences in\n\nrunoff between plot sizes were very low (in the order of\n12\u201320%, for micro-plots and small plots, respectively).\nThe runoff on the control plots decreased with increasing\nplot size mainly because of the low runoff amount of one\nof the small plots (684 mm), whereas the same was true\nbut in the opposite sense in the case of one small\nhydromulched plot (309 mm). These opposite tendencies\nresulted in a higher hydrological effectiveness of\nhydromulching for the micro-plots compared with the small\nplots (on average, 80% vs. 68%). Plot size also did not play\na clear-cut role in soil losses, but the variance increased,\nespecially in the case of the control SF plots (up to 70%).\nConsequently, the overall reduction in soil losses on the\nmicro-plots and small plots was somewhat higher compared\nwith the SF plots (90%, 89%, and 76%, respectively).\n\nTemporal Patterns in Overland Flow and Soil Losses\n\nThe average monthly runoff amounts produced by the\nuntreated plots revealed a marked seasonal pattern in which\npeak runoff values appeared to antecede the maximum\nmonthly rainfall values during the winter season (Figure 5a).\nAs a result, runoff coefficients were highest during the\nautumn months, varying between about 80% to 90% in\nDecember 2008, November 2009, and October 2010. High\nrunoff coefficients were also observed during late spring\nand early summer, when rainfall amounts were compara-\ntively small (<53 mm), attaining 62% in July 2009 and\n81% in June 2010. The average monthly soil losses at the\nuntreated plots revealed a less obvious temporal pattern\n(Figure 5b). The four peak losses of 50 g m?2 month?1 or\nmore occurred during autumn (December 2008, September\nand November 2009) and spring (May 2009). Apparently,\nthe latter peak was associated with the elevated maximum\nrainfall intensity (I30 = 29 mm h?1), whereas the December\n2008 and November 2009 ones were rather related to runoff\n\npeaks. The average specific soil losses suggested a contrast\nbetween the two months with the highest maximum rainfall\nintensities\u2014that is, May and September 2009\u2014and the\nremaining months. The specific losses during these two\nmonths amounted to 0\u00b78 and 1\u00b72 g m?2 mm rain?1, respec-\ntively, as opposed to the baseline monthly average of\n0\u00b725 g m?2 mm rain?1 for the rest of the study period.\nThe hydromulched plots produced, on average, consis-\n\ntently lower amounts of monthly runoff as well as monthly\nsoil losses than the untreated plots (Figure 5a and 5b). In\nthe case of runoff, these monthly differences were statistically\nsignificant from July 2009 onwards, with the exception of the\nsummer 2009 and 2010 months with little to no rainfall. In the\ncase of soil losses, however, the monthly differences were\nalso statistically significant for the first 2 months following\nhydromulching and, thus, for basically all of the 19 months\nwith noticeable rainfall. Even so, the three-way ANOVA\nresults indicated that hydromulching did not have an unequiv-\nocal statistically significant effect on monthly soil losses, as\nthe triple interaction term of treatment x time-since-mulching\nx plot size was statistically significant (Table III). The same\napplied to the corresponding specific soil losses as well as\nto the 1- to 2-weekly runoff volumes and mutatis mutandis\n(i.e., because of a significant treatment x time-since-mulching\ninteraction) to the runoff coefficients and the organic matter\ncontent of the eroded sediments.\nHydromulching failed to produce significant reductions in\n\noverland flow generation (average 1- to 2-weekly values)\nacross the whole range of maximum rainfall intensities\n(Figure 6). There was, however, a tendency for the hydrolog-\nical effectiveness of hydromulching to decrease with maxi-\nmum rainfall intensity, reflecting first and foremost the\ncomparatively low effectiveness (<50%) for the two more\nintense measurement periods that happened in May and\nSeptember 2009. Also, the effectiveness of hydromulching\nto reduce average monthly soil losses was comparatively\nlow for these two highest maximum rainfall intensities, albeit\nit still amounted to some 80% and corresponded to a statisti-\ncally significant difference between the hydromulched and\nuntreated plots. In overall terms, however, the reduction in soil\nlosses lacked an obvious relationship with rainfall intensity.\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n0.1 1.0 10.0\n\nR\nu\nn\no\nff\n a\n\nm\no\nu\nn\nt \n (\n\nm\nm\n\n)\n\nPlot surface (m2)\n\nrunoff C\nrunoff Hm\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n0.1 1.0 10.0\n\nS\no\nil \n\ne\nro\n\nsi\no\nn\n (\n\ng\n m\n\n-2\n)\n\nPlot surface (m2)\n\nsoil erosion C\nsoil erosion Hm\n\nFigure 4.

A. PRATS ET AL.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. LAND DEGRADATION &amp; DEVELOPMENT, (2013)\n\n\n\nKey Factors Explaining Runoff and Soil Losses\n\nStepwise multiple linear regression with all eight\nhydromulched and untreated runoff plots together (\u2018global\nmodel\u2019) revealed that the total protective ground cover\n\n(\u2018hlv\u2019) stood out as the principal factor in overland flow\ngeneration, explaining more than twice as much of the\nvariation in fourth-root transformed runoff amount than the\nsecond factor, I30 (31% vs. 13%; Table IV). The hydrolog-\nical response of the untreated plots alone, however, could\nclearly be explained best by rainfall amount (41% of\nvariance), whereas that of the hydromulched plots alone\nwas mainly controlled by maximum rainfall intensity, albeit\nto a lesser degree (19% of variance). Initial soil moisture\ncontent was the second most important (and significant)\nexplanatory variable of the runoff produced by the untreated\nbut not the hydromulched plots. The negative sign of its\ncoefficient suggested that the role of initial soil moisture\nwas indirect, with SWR increasingly enhancing overland\nflow generation as soils dry out. Figure 7 illustrated well that\nthe hydrological response of the untreated plots was stronger\nunder drier than wetter soil conditions. A similar tendency\nwas suggested for the hydromulched plots but just for rain-\nfall amounts below 60 mm, as higher rainfall amounts were\nassociated with wetter soils at the hydromulched than\nuntreated strips.\nThe predominant role of total protective ground cover\n\n(\u2018hlv\u2019) was even more pronounced in the case of the global\nmodel for soil losses than that for runoff volumes,\nexplaining over half of the variation (55%; Table IV).

Bare soil cover clearly outranked rainfall amount/\nintensity as the prime factor explaining soil losses, not only\nat the untreated plots (26% vs. 11% of variance) but also at\nthe hydromulched plots (35% vs. 8% of variance).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPost-Fire Hydrological and Erosion Response in Pine Sites\nof Central Portugal\n\nPost-fire runoff coefficients as high as observed here were\nalso reported by previous studies in north-central Portugal,\nsuch as Ferreira et al. (2008) and Malvar et al. (2011) by\nusing rainfall simulation experiments. Both prior studies\nrelated their strong hydrological response to extreme SWR.\nIn the present study, however, the role of SWR would be\nlimited to the first year after the wildfire, when repellency\nwas moderate, and mostly hydrophilic after November\n2009. This reduced importance of SWR was also suggested\nby the multivariate linear regression model that was fitted to\nthe runoff data from the control plots. The global regression\nmodel attested that it was rather ground cover that played a\nkey role in overland flow generation. Pierson et al. (2009)\nlikewise argued that ground cover exerted a greater\ninfluence on post-fire hydrological response than SWR.\nVarious studies in Portugal (Shakesby et al., 1996; Ferreira\net al., 2008; Prats et al., 2012) have furthermore attributed\nlow post-fire runoff coefficients in pine stands to needle cast\nfrom scorched tree crowns (Shakesby et al., 1996; Cerd\u00e0 &amp;\nDoerr, 2008; Ferreira et al., 2008; Prats et al., 2012).\nThe soil losses from the control plots during the first post-\n\nfire year (302 g m?2) were higher than the range of\n80\u2013220 g m ?2 year?1 reported by other studies in burnt pine\nplantations (Shakesby et al., 1996; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007;\nFerreira et al., 2008; Prats et al., 2012). This could be due\nto the salvage logging activities that took place during late\nwinter/early spring 2009, as was also suggested by the\nmarkedly higher specific soil losses immediately after log-\nging than during the pretreatment period. Logging-enhanced\nerosion rates were also reported by Inbar et al. (1997) and\n\nsuggested by Malvar et al. (2013) but not by Fern\u00e1ndez\net al. (2007). The latter authors attributed their findings to\nthe low severity of the fire, the low rainfall erosivity, and\nthe reduced perturbations of the soil by the machinery\nemployed. To minimize the erosion effects of post-fire\nlogging, it is widely recommended to delay the logging\nactivities until litter fall from scorched tree canopies has\nprovided a \u2018natural\u2019 mulching (Rab, 1994; Castillo et al.,\n1997; Edeso et al., 1999; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2004, 2007;\nCerd\u00e0 &amp; Doerr, 2008).\nThe soil losses during the first post-fire year fitted in well\n\nwith the low values that were reported by Shakesby (2011)\nfor moderate severity on field plots in the Mediterranean\nregion (321 g m?2 year?1), which was attributed to an\nintensive land-use history. By contrast, in regions of lower\nforest interventions such as North America, post-fire erosion\nrates can be one order of magnitude higher, amounting to\n2,500 g m?2 year?1 (Spigel &amp; Robichaud, 2007). The\ndiscrepancy between these two geographical regions seems\nto be much smaller for organic matter losses, with values\nof 200 and 150 g m?2 year?1. High losses of organic matter\nare of particular relevance as they can easily compromise\nsoil fertility and, thus, on-site land-use sustainability and\ndownstream surface water quality through pollution with\ntoxic pyrogenic organic compounds (Vila-Escal\u00e9 et al.,\n2007; Campos et al., 2012).\nA protective ground cover was also the most important\n\nfactor explaining the monthly soil losses observed in this\nstudy and the differences therein between the treated and\nuntreated plots. This agreed well with the bulk of post-fire\nsoil erosion studies (e.g., Benavides-Solorio &amp; MacDonald,\n2001; Pannkuk &amp; Roubichaud, 2003; Benavides-Solorio &amp;\nMacDonald, 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008; Larsen et al.,\n2009). At the same time, bare soil cover played a key role\nin the differences in soil losses among the hydromulched\nplots, as well as among the control plots. Pietraszek (2006)\nequally attested to the relevance of bare soil cover for soil\nlosses from untreated areas. It could explain 50% of the\nvariability in soil erosion produced by ten sites that had\nburnt from less than one up to 10 years earlier.\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n0 50 100 150\n\nR\nu\nn\no\nff\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n)\n\nRainfall amount (mm)\n\nHydromulched\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0 50 100 150\n\nR\nu\nn\no\nff\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n)\n\nRainfall amount (mm)\n\nControl\nsm<22.3\n\nsm>22.3\n\nFigure 7.

LAND DEGRADATION &amp; DEVELOPMENT, (2013)\n\n\n\nEffectiveness of Hydromulching in Reducing Runoff and\nSoil Losses\nThe hydromulch was a complex mixture which contained\nwater, wood fibers, seeds, surfactants, seed-growing bio-\nstimulants, nutrients and a green colorant. It is intended that\neach component affected some of the pieces of the post-fire\nrunoff erosion process.\nRunoff was highly reduced at the treated plots, between\n\n56% and 73%, which is higher than in other post-fire\nmulching experiments, both with straw (Bautista et al.,\n1996; Groen &amp; Woods, 2008) and forest residues (Shakesby\net al., 1996; Prats et al., 2012). Probably, this high effective-\nness could be related to the effect of the wood fibers,\nbecause it increases the surface water storage capacity, but\nalso due to the effect of the surfactants, a wetting agent that\nreduces SWR and increases soil infiltration (Leighton-Boyce\net al., 2007; Madsen et al., 2012).\nSoil losses were highly reduced in the hydromulch plots\n\nduring the 3 years after the wildfire. Ground cover was\npointed out as the main factor controlling soil losses, but the\nhydromulch mat showed a rapid decay during the first year\nafter the application. This was identified as one of the\ndisadvantages of hydromulchings (MacDonald &amp; Robichaud,\n2007). In the present study, the decayment rates of the\nhydromulch ranged between 4% and 6% per month, very\nsimilar to other research with hydromulch (Hubbert et al.,\n2012; Robichaud et al., 2013a). In contrast to those sites,\nour hydromulch was highly conducive to germination and\ngrowth of plants from seeds. Thus, the introduced seeds\ncompensated for the loss of hydromulch with progressively\nmore plant and litter cover, which resulted in more than\n70% protective ground cover since the hydromulch applica-\ntion until the third post-fire year (Figure 2).\nBesides the composition, the application technique can\n\ninfluence the hydromulch effectiveness. In this study, the\narea was already logged and the plots were small, which a\npriori will facilitate the spread of the hydromulch from a\njet hose operated on foot. However, the hydromulch cover\nwas significantly lower on the SF plots despite being suffi-\ncient to reduce soil erosion. Rough (2007) and Robichaud\net al. (2010) reported that the hydromulch sprayed from\nvehicles was intercepted by the standing trees, and they\nrecommended special caution when applying the mixture\nin areas with a high density of dead trees and from long dis-\ntances. Aerial hydromulch can be a better and less expensive\noption, but Hubbert et al. (2012) checked that the intended\napplication rates of 50% and 100% hydromulch cover\nresulted in only 20\u201326% and 56%.\nUnsuccessful hydromulch experiences were first attrib-\n\nuted to extreme rainfall events (Wohlgemuth et al., 2011)\nor to the long length of the plots (Napper, 2006). Robichaud\net al. (2010) pointed out that hydromulch effectiveness\ndepended on slope length, only being effective at slopes\nshorter than 10\u201320 m, when interrill erosion was the\ndominant process instead of rill erosion. The former authors\nhypothesized that in their long slope sections, the smooth\nand dense hydromulch mat had little resistance against the\n\nsheer force of concentrated flow. But on the other hand,\nthe research of Rough (2007) showed that aerial\nhydromulching was highly effective and was carried out at\nthe hillslope scale (2,500 m?2, on average), where rills were\nfrequent (0\u00b71 rills m?2) and after extreme rainfall events\n(I30 = 40 mm h?1). Many other hydromulch formulations\nare available and are being evaluated for their capacity to\nreduce soil losses. As concluded by Robichaud et al.\n(2013a), the differences in hydromulch components,\napplication techniques, and application rates can greatly\nimpact hydromulch effectiveness. However, Napper (2006)\nreferred that one of the major problems is the difficulty in\nknowing the specific chemical composition that was applied\nin a given situation because most of the hydromulch formu-\nlations are kept confidential.\n\nHydromulching Effects in Soil Properties\n\nSoil properties in agriculture had been typically improved\nby mulching (Smets et al., 2008) by materials such as\nmanure, stones, straw, forest residue, and wood shreds\n(Harris &amp; Yao, 1923; Mulumba &amp; Lal, 2008; Foltz &amp;\nCopeland, 2009). Regarding post-fire soil shear strength,\nthe results are not conclusive. Bautista et al. (1996) and\nFern\u00e1ndez et al. (2011) found no differences between\ncontrol and straw mulch plots. Fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2007)\nfound lower figures in logged compared to unlogged\nplots. They related these lower values to the absence of\nroots, once that the logged plots showed a much lower\nvegetation cover. Agreeing with them, the statistically\nhigher soil shear strength measured on the hydromulch\nstrip could be related to a higher vegetation cover\ncompared to the control strip. Regarding soil water prop-\nerties, our results are consistent with other mulch experi-\nments (Smets et al., 2008; Bautista et al., 2009; Prats\net al., 2012) in which higher soil moistures were found\non the mulched areas. The hydromulching layer acted\nas a water adsorbent dense mat, which effectively\nincreased the soil water retention capacity. It prevented\nsunlight from reaching the soil surface and thereby\ndecreased soil temperatures. Still, the surfactants included\non the hydromulch could have a role in increasing soil\ninfiltration and improve the seed germination (Madsen\net al., 2012). Besides the positive impacts over plant\nrecovery and soil microbial activity (Bautista et al.,\n2009), a major insight suggested by Prats et al. (2012)\nsupported the fact that mulching affected the SWR\nregime of the burnt forest, promoting the hydrophilic soil\nconditions. However, this was not true during the dry\nseasons. Probably, the higher plant cover of the\nhydromulch (13% vs. 3% during the first post-fire\nsummer) could increase the transpiration and thus lower-\ning soil moisture and increasing SWR. Brainard et al.\n(2012) reported a higher water demand of plants during\nwater stress periods in agriculture, and Soto &amp; Diaz-\nFierros (1997) found lower soil moisture on the vegetated\nareas as compared with bare and burnt plots during the\nfirst post-fire summer.\n\nS. A. PRATS ET AL.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. LAND DEGRADATION &amp; DEVELOPMENT, (2013)\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe main conclusions of this study in the effectiveness of\nhydromulching to reduce runoff and erosion in a recently\nburnt and logged pine plantation were as follows: (i)\nhydromulching, providing coverage of 80%, produced\nmarked changes in SWR and soil moisture, especially in\nthe soil cover. Despite a decrease of up to 30% after 1 year\nfrom the application, the treatment induced a highly protec-\ntive ground cover because of an increase of both vegetative\nand litter cover; (ii) hydromulching was highly effective\nduring the first 19 months after its application, reducing total\nrunoff volumes by 70% and total soil losses by 83%, and\ncontinued effectively during the third year following the\nwildfire, reducing erosion by 56%; ( iii) hydromulching\nwas less effective in reducing runoff (around 30%) but not\nin reducing soil losses (80%) for the more intense storms\n(I30 higher to 20 mm h?1); (iv) the protective soil cover\nprovided by hydromulch, in combination with litter and\nvegetation, explained runoff and soil losses better than any\nother variable, however, rainfall intensity and soil moisture\nexplained a considerable portion of the variation in runoff\ngeneration; (v) the application of hydromulch was lower\nthan expected on the larger plots (only a 64% hydromulch\ncover as compared with 90% in the smaller plots), despite\nboth applications having significantly reduced soil losses.\nFurther research will be needed to determine the effective\nground cover in order to match hydromulch decayment rate\nand vegetative cover increase over time, especially to mini-\nmize application costs; and (vi) soil losses were similar\nacross the range of plot sizes studied here (0\u00b725\u201310 m 2).\nThis, plus the small size of the plots, indicates that interrill\nerosion was the dominant erosion process. Further research\nis needed to determine how the effectiveness of hydro-\nmulching may vary with increasing slope length when rill\nerosion is more likely to occur.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank especially the companies Serraic\u2014\nCreate and Innovate, Lda., Atlalusi Europe and USSA\ncorporate, for freely providing and applying the\nhydromulch, the fire brigade of Arganil municipality for\nproviding the water needed for producing the hydromulch,\nand the Forestry Office of Arganil and the Portuguese\nNational Forestry Authority for giving authorization to carry\nout the experiment.

This was done, on mostly alternating dates, in two neighbouring commercial eucalypt plantations, one with an undisturbed and\none with a ploughed soil profile, in the foothills of the Gralheira Massif in north-central Portugal. Water repellency severity was measured in situ\nat soil depths of 2\u20133 and 7\u20138 cm using the \u2018Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet\u2019 (MED) test, and accompanied by soil moisture measurements using a\nThetaProbe\u2122 or, at a few occasions, sample analysis in the laboratory for gravimetric content.\n\nThe results show a broadly seasonal pattern of overall very high water repellency in dry periods and reduced or no repellency following prolonged\nrainfall. This was more pronounced at the undisturbed compared to the ploughed site, as the latter exhibited strong to extreme water repellency at\nalmost all sampling dates. Significant changes in repellency severity, including major increases, occurred within periods as short as 6\u20137 days,\nsuggesting that the sampling intervals used here may have not captured the full dynamics of topsoil repellency. Repellency severity was consistently\nlower at greater soil depth, in particular when considering the whole study period. Soil moisture was found to relate to the temporal variations in\nrepellency. As found in previous studies, however, soil moisture alone was not sufficient to predict the temporal variations in water repellency.\n\u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\n\nThe present study was carried out in the framework of a larger\nproject (EROSFIRE; Keizer et al., 2006, 2007), which aimed at\n\nmodelling soil erosion at the slope scale in recently burnt euca-\nlypt stands in north-central Portugal. Fire-induced soil water\nrepellency has been identified in the 1960s as a key factor in\nenhanced soil erosion in southern California chaparral following\nwildfires (see DeBano, 2000). Fire-induced or -enhanced soil\nwater repellency is widely regarded as an important factor in\nenhanced runoff response and accelerated soil erosion on re-\ncently burnt hillslopes (see e.g. DeBano, 2000; Shakesby and\nDoerr, 2006). Its relative importance in post-fire catchment\nresponses, compared to other factors such as litter and vegetation\ndestruction, however, has remained uncertain (Shakesby and\nDoerr, 2006), and its inclusion in soil erosion modelling is still in\nits infancy (Miller et al., 2003; Larsen and MacDonald, 2005;\nRobichaud et al. 2007).\n\nAvailable online at www.sciencedirect.com\n\nCatena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/catena\n\n?

Determining the patterns of tem-\nporal variation in water repellency, however, has been the focus\nof relatively few studies. One of the better studied environments\nin this context is eucalypt forests. For example, in Australia\n\nCrockford et al. (1991) have provided some insight into the soil\nwater repellency fluctuations between wet and dry periods, and\nDoerr et al. (2006a) have determined inter-annual changes\nfollowing burning. In north-central Portugal, Keizer et al.\n(2005b,c) and Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005) have monitored\nrepellency at regular intervals over extended periods. In the\nlatter study, repellency levels and soil water content were\nmeasured concurrently on the basis that water content is one of\n\nFig. 1. Location of the study area and of the nearest meteorological and rainfall station (Estarreja and Albergaria-a-Velha, respectively), with their average monthly\ntemperature (\u00b0C) and rainfall (mm) values. Also shown are the monthly rainfall amounts (mm) recorded at the study sites during the study period.\n\n193J.J. Keizer et al. / Catena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\n\n\n\nthe key variables relating to short-term (days to weeks)\ntemporal fluctuations in water repellency (Doerr and Thomas,\n2000; Dekker et al., 2001).\n\nIn the context of fire-affected environments, eucalypt stands\nappear to constitute a somewhat unusual case in that very high\nwater repellency levels have commonly been reported also for\n(long-)unburned stands under summer dry conditions in\nAustralia (Doerr et al. 2006a), South Africa (Scott, 2000) and\nPortugal (Doerr et al., 1998). In the latter study, long unburned\nstands showed similar repellency levels to recently burned\nstands. Thus, for wildfire-affected sites of this type, a major\ndifficulty lies in attributing the observed post-fire water repel-\nlency patterns to a fire-related and/or a fire-independent (i.e.\npre-fire) component. A further complication in these eucalypt\nstands is that monitoring temporal repellency patterns is often\nlimited by the typically rapid post-fire intervention (harvesting,\nploughing). Irrespective of any fire-effects on water repellency\nin these eucalypt forests, it is clear that the greatest impact of\nwater repellency on soil hydrological and erosional response is\nin the post-fire period until some protective ground cover is re-\nestablished (Shakesby et al., 2000).\n\nThe main aim of the present work was therefore to determine\nthe variations in soil water repellency in eucalypt stands in\nnorth-central Portugal at two different depths following a\nwildfire from shortly after burning to the onset of dry conditions\nin the following summer, ten months later. Special consideration\nis given to common, but contrasting forest planting practices in\nthe region by including a ploughed and an unploughed site. Soil\nmoisture content and antecedent rainfall are explored as poten-\ntial factors in explaining the observed variations in repellency.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Study area and sampling sites\n\nThe work was carried out in two adjacent commercial tree\nplantations in the foothills of the Gralheira Massif in north-\ncentral Portugal (Fig. 1). The two study sites are located at\napproximately 40\u00b0 42? North, 8\u00b0 29? West at an elevation of\n60\u201370 m a.s.l., and are within the A\u00e7ores locality of the\nAlbergaria-a-Velha municipality. The sites' slope length, angle\nand aspect are presented in Table 1.\n\nThe study sites were burnt by a wildfire that occurred in early\nJuly 2005 and affected an area of about 16 km2. The complete\nconsumption of the litter and herb cover, in conjunction with the\nonly partial consumption of the shrub layer, suggests that the\nfire had been of moderate severity (Shakesby and Doerr, 2006;\nsee Table 1 for more details). At the time of the fire, the two sites\nwere \u2013 like most of the burnt area \u2013 covered with eucalypt trees\n(Eucalyptus globulus Ait.) and, judging by the remaining tree\nstumps, had experienced at least two prior harvesting and\nregrowth cycles. Eucalypt plantations have been introduced\nwidely in Portugal since the mid 1950s, stimulated by the\ndemand from cellulose and paper industries (Daveau, 1998;\nRadich and Alves, 2000), and now dominate the hills and\nmountains of central Portugal. The two sites were selected for\ntheir different land management practices typical for this region.\n\nAt A\u00e7ores1, trees had been planted without heavy mechanical\nground operations, resulting in a relatively undisturbed soil\nprofile. At A\u00e7ores2, a clear pattern of ridges and furrows (up to\n20 cm high) running down the slope is present. Rip-ploughing\nin preparation for planting is a common practice in this region\nand, judging by the stand age, would have taken place around\n5 years prior to the fire.\n\nThe study area is situated at the transition of the region's two\nmajor physiographic units, the Littoral Platform dominated by\nCeno-Mesozoic deposits and the Hesperic Massif dominated by\npre-Ordovician schists and greywackes and Hercynian granites\n(Ferreira, 1978; Pereira and FitzPatrick, 1995). The soils of\nthe area are mapped \u2013 at a scale of 1:1.000.000 \u2013 as a complex\nof Humic Cambisols and, to a lesser extent, Dystric Litosols\n(Cardoso et al., 1971, 1973). At both study sites, two soil\nprofiles were excavated in the middle and at the bottom of the\nstudy slopes. The sites\u2019 soils correspond to Umbric or Dystric\nLeptosols (FAO, 1988), depending on the depth of the A\nhorizon. They are developed over schists and have sandy loam\ntextures and high organic matter contents (8.8\u201310.4%) (Lucena,\n2006).\n\nThe climate of the study area can be characterised as humid\nmeso-thermal, with a prolonged dry and warm summer\n(K\u00f6ppen Csb) (DRA-Centro, 1998). Mean annual temperature\nat the nearest meteorological station, located at circa 17.5 km\nfrom the study sites (Estarreja: 40\u00b0 47? N., 8\u00b0 35? W., 26 m a.s.\nl.; 1956\u20131977) is 13.9 \u00b0C, with monthly means ranging from\n8.8 \u00b0C in December to 19.1 \u00b0C in July (DRA-Centro, 1998).\nThe nearest rainfall station, located at circa 4 km distance from\nthe study sites (Albergaria-a-Velha: 40\u00b0 42? North, 8\u00b0 29? West,\n131 m a.s.l.; 1941\u20131991) has an average annual rainfall of\n1229 mm and yearly values varying between 750 and 2022 mm\n(DRA-Centro, 1998). The rainfall data used for the study period\nwere obtained with a tipping-bucket rainfall gauge (Pronamic\nProfessional Rain Gauge) linked to an ONSET Hobo Event\nLogger that was installed at the foot of the A\u00e7ores1 study site on\nSeptember 24 2005. The data prior to this date were obtained\nwith the same instrumentation at a site at less than 1 km\ndistance. The locations of the study sites and of the climate and\nrainfall station are given in Fig. 1. Monthly rainfall over the\nstudy period, which shows the pronounced seasonal variation,\nis also depicted in Fig. 1. Rainfall from November 2005 to\n\nTable 1\nGeneral characteristics of the unploughed (A\u00e7ores1) and ploughed (A\u00e7ores2)\nstudy sites\n\nVariable A\u00e7ores1 A\u00e7ores2\n\nPhysiognomy\nSlope section length (m) 20\u201325 30\u201340\nSlope angle (degrees) 20 15\nAspect SE NE\n\nFire severity indicators\nCrown damage Partial Partial\nHeight of tree scorching (m) ?9 ?12\nCombustion of litter/herbs layer Total Total\nCombustion shrub layer Partial Partial\nAsh colour Black Black\n\n194 J.J. Keizer et al. / Catena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\n\n\n\nJanuary 2006 at the study sites was roughly half of the long-\nterm average of the nearby Albergaria-a-Velha station (i.e. 280\nvs. 520 mm).\n\n2.2. Field sampling and data analysis\n\nOver a period of 10 months, starting September 20 2005 and\nending July 24 2006, a total of 1125 field soil water repellency\nmeasurements and 861 accompanying soil moisture readings/\nsamples were taken, divided more or less equally between the\ntwo study sites. The lower number of soil moisture values arose\nfrom initial soil moisture sensor malfunctioning and the occa-\nsional presence of stones, which impeded the insertion of the\nsensor into the soil. At both sites, sampling was carried out at 21\noccasions separated by intervals of typically two weeks, and\noccasionally one, three or four weeks. For logistic reasons, the\ntwo sites could not be sampled on the same dates but had to be\nsampled on alternating dates, except on six occasions more\ntowards the end of this study.\n\nOn both sites, sampling was carried out within an area\nroughly 30 m wide. This area corresponds to one of the three\nslope parts in which the study sites were divided to carry out the\nvarious tasks of the EROSFIRE project (Keizer et al., 2006,\n2007). The central slope part was reserved for the installation of\neight erosion plots, whilst the two lateral parts were selected\nrandomly for either rainfall simulation experiments or the pre-\nsent work. On each sampling occasion, a transect was laid out\nacross the full length of the slope section (see Table 1), starting\nat one corner of the area and shifting its location at subsequent\nsampling dates by fixed distances of roughly 1 m across the\nwidth of the slope. Along each transect, five sampling points\nwere selected, except at the last four sampling occasions in June\nand July 2006, when only three points were sampled. Thus, the\ntransects were divided in five (and later three) sections of the\nsame length, each of which with the sampling point in the\nmiddle.\n\nAt each transect point, a grid of 50 cm wide by 60 cm long\nand divided in cells of 5 by 5 cm was laid out and soil water\nrepellency was measured at three fixed points within this grid:\nthe middle cell and the third cell left and right of it. Where rock\noutcrops or tree stumps coincided with these points, measure-\nments were made as close as possible to these points. At each\ngrid cell, soil water repellency was determined in situ at depths\nof 2\u20133 and 7\u20138 cm in order to provide direct comparability with\nsoil moisture values obtained for these depths (see below).\nWater repellency severity was measured using the \u2018Molarity of\nan Ethanol Droplet\u2019 (MED) test (e.g. King, 1981; Doerr, 1998).\nThis involved applying three droplets of increasing ethanol\nconcentration to fresh parts of the soil surface until infiltration\nof at least two of three droplets of the same concentration\noccurred within 5 s. Test results are given as median ethanol\nconcentrations (vol.%) and associated median concentration\nclasses. These are given in Table 2, together with corresponding\nmolarity of ethanol and surface tension (?) values, which are\nincluded as a look-up table for comparison of the present results\nwith those of studies presenting molarity or surface tension\nvalues. Repellency measurements were normally followed\n\nby in situ volumetric soil moisture determinations using an\nML2 ThetaProbe\u2122 connected to a HH2 ThetaMeter (Delta T-\nDevices Ltd.), except where the presence of stones did not allow\ninsertion of the probe. The probe was inserted horizontally into\nthe soil at 0\u20135 cm and 5\u201310 cm depth, using the hole dug for the\npurpose of the repellency measurements. 5 cm is the minimum\nsoil depth required to acquire moisture data given the spacing of\nthe probe\u2019s prongs. For the first three (A\u00e7ores1) or four\n(A\u00e7ores2) sampling occasions, due to technical problems with\nthe probe, three samples were taken for determining soil mois-\nture content gravimetrically by drying at 105 \u00b0C for 24 h and\nconverting this to volumetric estimates based on Saxton et al.\n(1986) for saturated soil moisture content and Costa (1999) for\nspecific density.\n\nStatistical analyses were carried out using STATISTICA for\nWindows Release 5.5, by StatSoft Inc., except for the \u201cruns test\nabove and below the median\u201d which was computed manually\nfollowing Sokal and Rohlf (1981) and Rohlf and Sokal (1981).\nSince the ethanol concentrations utilised in the MED test do not\ncorrespond to an ordinal scale with a constant measurement\nunit, rank-based descriptive statistics and non-parametric sta-\ntistical tests using the ethanol classes were used. Comparison-\nwise type I errors ? were computed for the multiple, unplanned\ncomparisons between water repellency measurements of sub-\nsequent sampling dates (Table 4), and of median ethanol classes\nand median soil moisture contents with antecedent rainfall\namounts (Table 7). This was done following the Dunn\u2013\u0160id\u00e1k\nmethod (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981).\n\nThe independence of the soil water repellency and soil\nmoisture values obtained for a certain sampling depth and date\nwas tested using the \u201cruns test above and below the median\u201d\n(see Sokal and Rohlf, 1981). The three measurements at the\nthree to five transect points were arrayed in their natural order of\nincreasing numbering of transect and grid point numbers.\nWhenever a series of values differed significantly from a ran-\ndom sequence, only the median values of three to five transect\npoints were retained for further analysis and, thus, considered to\nconstitute the individual measurements. A lack of independence\nwas detected more frequently in the case of the moisture\nmeasurements than the repellency measurements, i.e. in 17 and\n11 instances out of 84, respectively. The latter can be identified\n\nTable 2\nVolumetric ethanol percentage concentrations used in the \u2018Molarity of an\nEthanol Droplet\u2019 (MED) tests, and corresponding ethanol classes, MED and\nsurface tension values as well as water repellency severity rating (based on King,\n1981; Doerr, 1998)\n\nEthanol concentration\n(vol.%)\n\nEthanol\nclass\n\nMolarity\n(MED)\n\nSurface tension\n(mN m?1)\n\nRepellency\nseverity rating\n\n0 0 0 72.1 None\n1 1 0.17 66.9 None\n3 2 0.51 60.9 None\n5 3 0.85 56.6 Slight\n8.5 4 1.45 51.2 Moderate\n13 5 2.22 46.3 Strong\n18 6 3.07 42.3 Very strong\n24 7 4.09 38.6 Very strong\n?36 8 6.14 33.1 Extreme\n\n195J.J.

Temporal variations in water repellency\n\nOverall water repellency levels of the near-surface samples\nare dominated throughout the 10-month measurement period by\nvery strong to extreme severity (ethanol classes 6 to 8; Fig. 2).\nHigh levels of soil water repellency under Eucalyptus spp.\nstands have previously been reported: (i) in the region for fire-\naffected soils of similar texture (Shakesby et al, 1993; Coelho\net al., 2005) and for unburned eucalypt stands on coastal dune\nsand (Keizer et al., 2005a, c); (ii) from their native Australia\n(e.g. Burch et al., 1989; Crockford et al., 1991); and (iii) other\nareas such as northern and southern Africa (e.g. Scott, 1993;\nCoelho et al., 2005) and north-western Spain (e.g. Varela et al.,\n2005; Rodr\u00edguez-Alleres et al., 2007b).\n\nAt both sampling depths, overall repellency levels are higher\nfor the ploughed (A\u00e7ores2) than the unploughed (A\u00e7ores1) site\n(ethanol classes 8 and 7 vs. 6 and 5). According to Shakesby\net al. (1993), deep-ploughing can render previously hydro-\nphobic soils hydrophilic. The higher repellency levels at the\nploughed site suggest that the effect of ploughing in lowering\nwater repellency does not last for more than the 4 to 5 years that\n\nhave passed since the ploughing of this site. Broadly in line with\nthe present results, Doerr et al. (1996) found similar repellency\nvalues for air-dried surface samples from an undisturbed euca-\nlypt site and from one that had been ploughed six years before.\nIn a later study, Doerr et al. (1998) found that the effect of\nploughing could be as short-lived as two years, in particular\nlocally around young eucalypt trees. In a more detailed study in\nthe same region, Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005) suggested that a\nperiod as short as six months could be sufficient for the wide-\nspread development of water repellency from the soil surface up\nto a depth of 20 cm.\n\nNotwithstanding the overall predominance of very strong to\nextreme median repellency levels, non-repellent median condi-\ntions occur on six (A\u00e7ores1) and three (A\u00e7ores2) occasions\n(Fig. 2), corroborating the transient nature of topsoil water\nrepellency reported from burnt and unburned eucalypt stands\n(e.g. Crockford et al., 1991; Doerr and Thomas, 2000; Coelho\net al., 2005; Keizer et al., 2005a). The most straightforward\ntemporal pattern of water repellency (median ethanol class\nvalues) is evident for the upper sampling depth of the un-\nploughed (A\u00e7ores1) site. Its median repellency levels are very\nstrong to extreme before January 2006 and after April 2006, and\nnon-repellent from February to April 2006. This pattern agrees\nreasonably well with the broadly seasonal cycle of low re-\npellency frequency during wet winter conditions and greatest\nrepellency frequency in late summer that Leighton-Boyce et al.\n\nFig. 2. Temporal variation in median ethanol classes at 2\u20133 and 7\u20138 cm below the soil surface on the two study sites.\n\n196 J.J. Keizer et al. / Catena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\n\n\n\n(2005) reported for burnt and unburned eucalypt stands, despite\nthe below average rainfall received during the study period (see\nSection 2). Similar rainfall-related seasonal patterns in soil\nwater repellency have also been suggested for other vegetation\ntypes (see review by Doerr et al., 2000). The ploughed\n(A\u00e7ores2) site presents a somewhat contrasting situation, with\nnon-repellent median conditions being restricted to only two\nsampling dates (March 20 and May 2 2006). A similar brief\nintermission of mostly wettable soil has also been reported for\nan unburned eucalypt stand but its brevity was considered\nsomewhat atypical and due to unusually low rainfall (Keizer\net al., 2005c).\n\nThe present results, supported by findings in Keizer et al.\n(2005c) in which similar sampling intervals were used, reveal\nthat major changes in repellency levels can occur within a\nperiod of a few weeks. Changes of five or more ethanol classes\nare common, occurring between three and five times at each of\nthe two sampling depths at both sites and occurring mostly\nsimultaneously at the two depths of each site. These simul-\ntaneous major changes occur on three subsequent occasions, i.e.\nbetween December 19 2005 and February 6 2006 in the case of\nunploughed (A\u00e7ores1) site, and between March 20 and May 8\n2006 in the case of the ploughed (A\u00e7ores2) site. The statistical\nsignificance of these and other changes is addressed in Section\n3.2. Relatively rapid increases in water repellency under euca-\nlypts have previously been reported by Keizer et al. (2005b: 3\u2013\n4 weeks) and Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005: 22 days) and\nCrockford et al. (1991: 6\u20139 days). In the latter study, however,\ninitial repellency levels had not been quantified. The fact that\nchanges from non-repellent to extreme repellent conditions\noccur over such short time intervals implies that an adequate\ndescription of the temporal dynamics of water repellency under\nfield conditions requires frequent sampling, especially during\nsoil wetting and drying phases. This would be best achieved\nby a non-destructive measurement technique, which, ideally,\nwould also be applicable during rainfall events as also advo-\ncated by Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005). Such a technique is\ncurrently not available and frequent field visits using destructive\nsampling techniques thus remain the best available option. With\nrespect to the results of the current study, the dramatic changes\nbetween subsequent sampling dates imply that caution is re-\nquired in comparing the data from the two sites as their sam-\npling dates were not identical.\n\nFig. 3.

Keizer et al. / Catena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\n\n\n\nTwo of the four temporal patterns in Fig. 2 correspond to time\nseries that differ significantly from random sequences (Table 3).\nThey are that of the upper sampling depth of the unploughed\n(A\u00e7ores1) site and that of the lower sampling depth of the\nploughed (A\u00e7ores2) site. Fig. 3 clearly shows that the two non-\nrandom patterns are rather distinct. That of the unploughed site\nreveals two periods with \u201cequal and above median\u201d values\n(before January 2006 and after April 2006), whereas that of the\nploughed site reveals just a single period with \u201cequal and above\nmedian\u201d values (before March 2006). In other words, the test\nresults seem to imply that water repellency breaks down earlier\nand, thus, more readily to \u201cbelow-median\u201d levels at the un-\nploughed than ploughed site (January vs. March 2006). Re-\npellency also restores earlier and, thus, more readily to prior\n\u201cabove-median\u201d levels at the unploughed than ploughed site\n(May vs. after July 2006). This earlier recovery, however, does\nnot coincide with noticeably higher median repellency values at\nthe ploughed than unploughed site from May 2006 onwards. The\nearlier fall in median repellency levels at the unploughed site\nconstitutes the most conspicuous difference with the ploughed\nsite. This difference could be related to greater water losses at the\nploughed site through: (i) enhanced overland flow, channelled\ndownslope through the furrows, as found by Ferreira et al.\n(2000); and/or (ii) accelerated preferential infiltration, through\ncracks resulting from the destruction of the soil profile, as sug-\ngested by e.g. Scott (2000).\n\nAlthough the temporal pattern of the upper sampling depth at\nA\u00e7ores2 (Fig. 2) appears quite similar to that of the site\u2019s lower\ndepth, it is not significantly different from a random series\n(Table 3). This is due to the fact that none of the individual\nvalues is \u201cabove the overall median value (Fig. 3), thereby\n\nhampering the respective runs test. The number of individual\nvalues that is equal to the overall median value (and, thus, does\nnot contribute to the runs) is also high in three of the other runs\ntests in Table 3. This, together with the large number of ties in\nother statistical tests (Tables 4 and 5), suggests the need for a\n\nTable 4\nMann-Whitney U-Test (Us) between ethanol classes, at 2\u20133 and 7\u20138 cm depth, of subsequent sampling dates\n\nA\u00e7ores1 (unploughed) A\u00e7ores2 (ploughed)\n\nDate first\nperiod (i)\n\n2\u20133 cm depth 7\u20138 cm depth Date first period (i) 2\u20133 cm depth 7\u20138 cm depth\n\nU N(i) U N(i) U N(i) U N(i)\n\n26-Sep-05 12.0 15 97.5 15 20-Sep-05 62.0 15 18.0 15\n10-Oct-05 26.0 5 62.0 15 03-Oct-05 39.0 15 12.0 5\n24-Oct-05 84.0 15 100.0 15 17-Oct-05 84.0 15 12.0 5\n07-Nov-05 98.0 15 106.5 15 01-Nov-05 87.0 15 34.0 5\n21-Nov-05 87.5 15 21.5 15 14-Nov-05 90.0 15 67.5 15\n05-Dec-05 99.0 14 28.5 5 28-Nov-05 105.0 15 82.5 15\n19-Dec-05 2.0 15 37.5 15 12-Dec-05 84.0 15 75.0 15\n09-Jan-06 12.5 15 37.5 15 03-Jan-06 102.0 15 32.0 15\n23-Jan-06 12.0 5 55.5 15 16-Jan-06 84.0 15 20.0 5\n06-Feb-06 26.0 5 93.0 15 30-Jan-06 105.0 15 105.0 15\n20-Feb-06 110.0 15 99.0 15 13-Feb-06 25.5 15 25.0 15\n13-Mar-06 90.0 15 111.0 15 06-Mar-06 21.0 5 33.0 5\n03-Apr-06 110.0 15 90.0 15 20-Mar-06 42.5 15 52.0 15\n18-Apr-06 9.0 15 15.0 15 03-Apr-06 42.0 9 37.5 9\n08-May-06 13.0 9 20.0 9 02-May-06 12.0 15 13.5 15\n15-May-06 67.0 15 25.0 5 08-May-06 30.0 9 57.0 9\n29-May-06 57.5 15 62.0 15 22-May-06 58.0 15 47.0 15\n12-Jun-06 35.5 9 25.0 9 12-Jun-06 26.5 9 24.0 9\n19-Jun-06 37.5 9 34.0 9 19-Jun-06 20.0 9 36.0 9\n10-Jul-06 22.5 9 27.5 9 10-Jul-06 24.0 9 24.0 9\n\nH0: MED classes on date i=MED classes date i+1, with Us significant at ??=0.025 (following the Dunn\u2013\u0160id\u00e1k method for 2 comparisons at ?=0.05) being\nunderlined.

Keizer et al. / Catena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\n\n\n\nmore extended repellency measurement scale for studies in\neucalypt stands. Indeed a higher concentration (50%) has\nalready been introduced in the recent study by Leighton-Boyce\net al. (2005). This, however, has to be balanced against the\nincreased demand in terms of the additional effort and sampling\nspace required.\n\n3.2. Temporal patterns of spatial variability\n\nThe spatial variation in repellency at the different sampling\ndates, expressed here by the inter-quartile ranges of the indi-\nvidual ethanol class values, is shown in Fig. 4 for both study\nsites and both sampling depths. In all four cases, spatial vari-\nability varies substantially throughout the sampling period, with\ninter-quartile ranges covering the entire or almost entire span of\nethanol class values from zero to eight.\n\nThe temporal patterns in inter-quartile ranges (Fig. 4) are\nmore complex than those in median levels (Fig. 2). The upper\nsampling depth of the unploughed site (A\u00e7ores1) is an excep-\ntion, with spatial variability being low (?1) before mid January\n2006 (except on December 5 2005) and, again, after April 2006.\nAccording to the \u201cruns test above and below the median\u201d,\nhowever, none of the four temporal patterns differs significantly\nfrom a random series (Table 3). The relationship between spatial\nvariability and median levels of repellency is also not straight-\n\nforward. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients (rho=\n?0.09, 0.25, ?0.40 and ?0.20 for the upper and lower sampling\ndepths of A\u00e7ores1 and A\u00e7ores2, respectively) do not differ\nsignificantly from zero (at ?=0.05) for any of the two sites and\ndepths. Furthermore, extreme median severity levels can be\nequally associated with high or low spatial variability, and so\ncan non-repellent median levels. This is particularly well il-\nlustrated by the lower sampling depth of the ploughed site and\nthe upper sampling depth of the unploughed site. In the latter\ncase, for example, on November 21 and December 5 2005\nmedian ethanol classes are 8 and inter-quartile ranges are 0.5\nand 5, whereas on March 13 and April 3 2006 median ethanol\nclasses are 0 and inter-quartile ranges are 7 and 0.5.\n\nThe results obtained here confirm earlier observations in\nburnt and unburned eucalypt stands that repellency can be\nspatially homogeneous (e.g. Doerr et al. 1998, 2006a; Keizer\net al., 2005c). Even though (largely) uniform conditions \u2013\nextremely repellent but also wettable \u2013 are not exceptional in\nthe current study, transitional states between these two extremes\nprevail. An adequate descriptor of the various states-of-repel-\nlency would ideally combine overall repellency level and de-\ngree of spatial variability, in view of their distinct temporal\npatterns and poor correlation. Even though such a combined\nindex would not take into account the spatial organisation of\nrepellent patches per se, it would also be useful for analysing\n\nFig. 4. Temporal variation in inter-quartile ethanol class ranges at 2\u20133 and 7\u20138 cm depth on the two study sites.\n\n199J.J. Keizer et al. / Catena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\n\n\n\nrepellency\u2019s spatial contiguity and the associated effects in\nterms of repellency enhancing overland flow and erosion risk,\nas postulated by Shakesby et al. (2000).\n\nThe spatial variability explains why only half of the above-\nmentioned major changes in median ethanol classes correspond\nto statistically significant differences (Table 4). This propor-\ntion is higher for the ploughed (A\u00e7ores1) than unploughed\n(A\u00e7ores2) site, i.e. six out of nine as opposed to two out of seven.\nFive of these six differences at the unploughed site coincide with\nthe above-mentioned three simultaneous major changes at the\ntwo sampling depths, i.e. the drops between December 19 2005\nand January 9 2006 and between January 23 and February 6\n2006 as well as the intermittent rise. The two significant and\nmajor differences at the ploughed site also occur simultaneously\nat the two depths but they concern the rise between May 2 and\nMay 8 2006 and not the antecedent reductions.\n\nThe seasonal fall in water repellency in winter is rather\ndistinct at the two sites. Not only does it occur later at the\nploughed than unploughed site but it is also less well-defined\nstatistically. That the winter reduction at the ploughed site is\nmasked statistically by a more pronounced spatial variability\ntallies with non-uniform infiltration and, as mentioned before,\nprofile disturbance by ploughing. On the other hand, the lower\nsampling depth of the unploughed site equally reveals an initial\nmajor fall that is not statistically significant, probably associated\nwith to the high inter-quartile range on December 5 2005 in\nparticular.\n\nIn contrast to the winter reduction in repellency, the spring\nre-establishment to prolonged repellent conditions is remark-\nably similar for the two sites as well as the two sampling depths.\nIt occurs at roughly the same period (i.e. between April 18 and\nMay 8 2006) and involves statistically significant changes in all\nfour cases, even in that of the lower sampling depth of the\nunploughed (A\u00e7ores1) site where the difference amounts to\njust three ethanol classes. The spring re-establishment at the\nploughed (A\u00e7ores2) site is worth further reference for involving\na period as short as six days (May 2 to 8 2006). This agrees well\nwith the 6\u20139 days suggested, as referred earlier, by Crockford\net al. (1991). A similarly short period of seven days is involved\nin the statistically significant change at the upper sampling\ndepth of the unploughed (A\u00e7ores1) site between May 8 and 15\n2006 but this concerns a decrease and just a minor one of only\none ethanol class. These three instances of rapid significant\nchanges further substantiate the earlier observation that even a\ncomparatively intensive monitoring scheme as applied in this\nstudy may not capture the complete temporal dynamics of water\nrepellency.\n\nFrom the 13 statistically significant differences listed in\nTable 4, four correspond to particularly minor changes in me-\ndian repellency levels of just one ethanol class. All four are\nrestricted to the upper sampling depths and involve low spatial\nvariability at both of the sampling dates under comparison.\nAlso, the differences occur roughly simultaneously at the two\nsites and, in each period, have the same sign. Whereas the\ndecrease at the unploughed site between May 8 and 15 2006\nwas already mentioned in the previous paragraph, that at the\nploughed site occurs between May 8 and 22 2006 and, thus,\n\nequally after the spring re-establishment to prolonged repellent\nconditions. The other two changes occur in the initial phase of\nthis study, between September 26 and October 10 2005 at the\nunploughed site, and between October 3 and 17 2005 at the\nploughed (A\u00e7ores2) site. They could indicate a gradual\nrecovery of subsurface repellency following its (partial)\ndestruction by the wildfire or, alternatively, a gradual increase\nin pre-fire repellency following downward translocation of\nhydrophobic substances from the burned/heated overlying litter\nand topsoil (see e.g. DeBano, 2000). The former hypothesis is\nperhaps less likely for the lower than upper sampling depth, also\nbecause of the moderate severity of the wildfire. In eucalypt\nstands, the removal of topsoil repellency during burning has\nbeen reported to a depth of 3 cm by Scott (1993) and of 5 cm by\nDoerr et al. (2006a), with a well-documented role of fire\nseverity in the latter case. While Scott (1993) did not find\nconclusive evidence for intensification of repellency at greater\nsoil depths, such evidence was found in the study by Doerr et al.\n(2006a) and in studies examining other vegetation types (e.g.\nHuffman et al., 2001; Mataix-Solera and Doerr, 2004; Hubbert\nand Oriol, 2005).\n\n3.3. Water repellency variation with soil depth\n\nAt both study sites, the temporal patterns in median ethanol\nclasses at the two sampling depths are strongly correlated. The\nSpearman rank correlation coefficient is 0.71 and significantly\ndifferent from zero at ?=0.01 for both sites. However, as evident\nin Fig. 2, the median ethanol classes at the upper sampling depth\ntend to be systematically higher from those at the lower depth.\nAccording to the Wilcoxon\u2019s Signed-Ranks Test (and notwith-\nstanding the considerable numbers of ties (9 and 12)), this\ntendency is statistically significant (at ?=0.05) for both study\nsites (Z=2.59 and 2.00 for A\u00e7ores1 and A\u00e7ores2, respectively).\n\nThe Wilcoxon\u2019s Signed-Ranks Test was also used to\ncompare the two sampling depths on the individual sampling\ndates (Table 5). In agreement with the results mentioned in\nthe previous paragraph, all six instances of statistically\nsignificant differences involve higher ethanol classes at the\nupper than lower sampling depth. They include three of the\nfour differences in median repellency values that amount to\nthree or more ethanol classes, i.e. on May 8 and July 24\n2006 at the A\u00e7ores1 and on June 19 2006 at the A\u00e7ores2. The\nfourth of these larger differences (A\u00e7ores1, December 5 2005)\nis by the far largest comprising eight ethanol classes, but it is\nexceptional in involving pronounced spatial variability at both\nsampling depths. The remaining three depth-related and\nstatistically significant differences (A\u00e7ores1, November 21\nand December 19 2005; A\u00e7ores2, May 8 2006) concern\ndifferences in median ethanol classes ranging from two down\nto zero. All three cases, however, typically involve an upper\nsampling depth with extreme and homogeneous water\nrepellency conditions.\n\nIt is not clear if the observed tendency for less severe\nrepellency at greater depth can be attributed to the wildfire, in\nparticular through a decreased influx of hydrophobic\nsubstances with depth or a decreasing degree of heat-induced\n\n200 J.J. Keizer et al. / Catena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\n\n\n\nstructural alteration of organic compounds already present\n(Doerr et al., 2006a). In (long-)unburned soils under\neucalypts, decreasing occurrence and/or severity of repellency\nwith increasing depth has been reported in a range of studies,\nfor example, in South Africa (Scott, 2000), Australia (Doerr\net al., 2006a) or Spain (Rodr\u00edguez-Alleres et al., 2007a),\nwhereas little or no differences between depths were found in\nPortugal by Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005: 10 vs. 20 cm depth)\n\nand Keizer et al. (2005a,b: 2\u20133 vs. 7\u20138 cm depth). Evidence\nfrom burnt soils under eucalypts is even scarcer, but equally\ninconsistent. In studies in Portugal, Doerr et al. (1996)\nreported a lack of consistent patterns and Leighton-Boyce et\nal. (2005) observed no substantial differences between 10 and\n20 cm depth. In burnt sites in Australia, however, Doerr et al.\n(2006a) reported a substantially higher frequency of wettable\nsamples at 0\u20132 than 2\u20135 cm depth.\n\nFig. 5. Temporal variation in median volumetric soil moisture contents at 2\u20133 and 7\u20138 cm below the soil surface on the two study sites, and corresponding total rainfall\namounts over the 14-day period prior to sampling.\n\n201J.J. Keizer et al. / Catena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\n\n\n\n3.4. Relationship of soil water repellency with soil moisture\nand antecedent rainfall\n\nFig. 5 depicts the median volumetric soil moisture values\nof the individual sampling dates for both sites and sampling\ndepths. In agreement with the commonly reported inverse rela-\ntionship between soil water repellency and soil moisture (see\nreview by Doerr et al., 2000), overall soil moisture levels\nat both sampling depths are higher at the overall less repel-\nlent unploughed than ploughed site (5.9 vs. 5.2% and 9.6 vs.\n7.1 vol.%). Accordingly, they are lower at the upper than lower\nsoil depth at both sites (5.9 vs. 9.6 and 5.2 vs. 7.1 vol.%). As for\nwater repellency, median moisture values at the two sampling\ndepths are, throughout the study period, strongly correlated\n(Spearman's rho=0.80 for A\u00e7ores1 and 0.81 for A\u00e7ores2;\npsb0.01) as well as systematically different (Wilcoxon's\nSigned-Ranks Test Z=3.49 for A\u00e7ores1 and 3.93 for A\u00e7ores2;\npsb0.01).\n\nAt the level of the individual measurements, the above-\nmentioned inverse relationship of water repellency with mois-\nture content is statistically significant for both study sites and\nboth sampling depths (Table 6). At both sites, the correlation is\nnoticeably stronger for the lower than upper sampling depth but,\nat each depth, it differs little between the two sites. The median\nvalues of the sampling dates, however, reveal a significant\nmonotonic correlation for the two sampling depths at A\u00e7ores1,\nbut not at A\u00e7ores2 (Table 6). Especially for the upper A\u00e7ores2\n\ndepth, the coefficients are rather distinct for the two data sets.\nThe particularly weak correlation for the median values seems\nto correspond to some sampling artefact (involving a strong\nskew towards high median ethanol classes in a small sample)\nrather than to indicate some location-specific repellency\u2013mois-\nture relationship. Such a specific relationship is neither sug-\ngested by the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for all\n84 median values (rho=?0.51; pb0.01), nor is it evident from\nFig. 6.\n\nFor eucalypt soils, a broad inverse relationship between\nwater repellency and moisture content, as found here, is\nperhaps more commonly accepted than substantiated.\nWhereas some datasets are consistent with such relationship\n(Walsh et al., 1994; Coelho et al., 2005; Keizer et al., 2005a),\nothers are not (Crockford et al., 1991; Ferreira et al., 2005;\nRodr\u00edguez-Alleres et al., 2007a). The most detailed previous\nstudies in Portugal (Doerr and Thomas, 2000; Leighton-\nBoyce et al., 2005) and elsewhere (Dekker et al. 2001; Doerr\net al, 2006b) reported a general association of wettable soil\nconditions with moist soil status and high repellency with dry\nsoil, but also suggest soil moisture alone is insufficient to\nexplain temporal fluctuations in water repellency. The current\nstudy supports these findings and demonstrates that this\napplies equally to unburned and recently burnt eucalypt\nstands. A transition zone, rather than a distinct threshold\ndemarcating wettable and repellent conditions (Dekker et al.,\n2001; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005), can also be detected in\nthe data obtained here (Fig. 6), especially at A\u00e7ores1. For this\nsite, the transition zone encompasses a narrower soil moisture\nrange (9\u201311 vol.%) than in the case of Leighton-Boyce et\nal.\u2019s mature eucalypt site (14\u201327 vol.%).\n\nFig. 5 also shows the cumulative rainfall amounts over the\n14-day periods preceding the sampling dates. This 14-day pe-\nriod was chosen over shorter periods for presenting, on overall,\nthe best correlation with median soil moisture values (Table 7).\nIt is worth noting, however, that none of the Spearman's rank\ncorrelation coefficients in Table 7 is significantly different from\nzero when the multiple-comparison correction following the\nDunn\u2013\u0160id\u00e1k method is taken into consideration. Overall, it is\nclear that median ethanol class values correspond better to\nmedian soil moisture contents than to antecedent rainfall. This\nis to be expected since, in addition to water repellency,\n\nTable 6\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficients (rho) between median ethanol classes\nand median volumetric soil moisture contents at 2\u20133 and 7\u20138 cm depth on 21\nsampling dates, as well as between individual measurements of ethanol class and\naccompanying volumetric soil moisture content\n\nSite A\u00e7ores1\n(unploughed)\n\nA\u00e7ores2\n(ploughed)\n\nSoil depth (cm) 2\u20133 7\u20138 2\u20133 7\u20138\n\nMedian values ?0.46 ?0.52 0.11 ?0.39\nn 21 21 21 21\nIndividual measurements ?0.41 ?0.56 ?0.36 ?0.50\nN 141 167 180 157\n\nUnderlined rho values are significant at ?=0.05.\n\nFig. 6.

Keizer et al. / Catena 74 (2008) 192\u2013204\n\n\n\nspatial variability in rainfall, interception, evapotranspiration\nand preferential flow will determine how much rainfall is\navailable to ultimately penetrate the soil matrix.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that the existing findings on the\nrelationship of water repellency with antecedent rainfall for\neucalypt stands show even less consistency than those for the\nrepellency\u2013soil moisture relationship. Thus, Keizer et al.\n(2005b) found a monotonic correlation for repellency at 2\u2013\n3 cm below the soil surface, which is comparable (i.e. statis-\ntically significant at ?=0.05) to that reported here with soil\nmoisture content, whereas Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005) re-\nported an only very generalised relationship with antecedent\nrainfall totals. In the present case, the poor relationship is well\nillustrated by A\u00e7ores1, where four subsequent 2-week periods\nof 50\u2013100 mm and a total of 300 mm rainfall do not result in a\nsignificant decrease in repellency, but 65 mm of rain precede the\ndistinct reduction in repellency in early January. Clearly other\nfactors such as rainfall intensity, temperature, microbial activity\nand other seasonally variable factors may play a role in deter-\nmining temporal changes in water repellency.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nThe main conclusions arising from this study concerning the\ntemporal variation in water repellency as measured for in situ\ntopsoil of two recently burnt eucalypt stands on steep hillslopes\nin north-central Portugal are as follows.\n\n\u2013 Overall severity levels of soil water repellency reveal broad-\nly seasonal variations, however, specific temporal patterns in\nspatial variability are more irregular and poorly related to\noverall levels. Therefore, overall levels alone are not suf-\nficient to assess the likely impact of repellency on soil\nhydrological behaviour.\n\n\u2013 Statistically significant increases and decreases in repellency\nseverity were detected over time intervals as short as 6\u2013\n7 days, suggesting that a higher sampling frequency than that\nused here is required to fully capture the temporal dynamics\nof soil water repellency in this environment.\n\n\u2013 The ploughed and unploughed sites show perceptible\ndifferences in their overall levels of repellency and its\ntemporal variations. Although ploughing has been shown to\ndestroy repellency by mixing repellent and wettable soil, the\nsite ploughed 4\u20135 years ago shows overall similar or greater\nlevels of repellency than the unploughed site examined here.\n\n\u2013 It is not clear whether burning had any effect on water\nrepellency levels at the two soil depths examined in this\nstudy. The decrease of water repellency with depth is similar\nto those reported from unburnt forests examined elsewhere.\n\n\u2013 Soil moisture content is a better predictor for water repel-\nlency levels than antecedent rainfall, however, its value for\npredicting repellency occurrence is limited.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe present study was carried out in the framework of the\nEROSFIRE project (POCI/AGR/60354/2004) and with sup-\nport of the PHOENIX project (POCI/AGR/58896/2004), both\nfinanced by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and\nTechnology (FCT) with co-funding by FEDER through the\nPOCI2010 Programme.

Overall discussion and general conclusions \n\n7.1 Overall runoff and erosion rates \n\n \n\nThis research provides an understanding into post-fire runoff and soil erosion, at the \n\nmicro- and small- plot scales, related with different pre- and post- fire land management \n\noperations under natural and artificial rainfall. The research was carried out in six \n\neucalyptus plantations and in one pine plantation.  \n\nThe maximum and minimum plot values of runoff and specific sediment losses, during \n\ntwo years following the wildfire highlighted the effects of: (i) land use (pine vs. eucalypt); \n\n(ii) pre-fire ploughing and (iii) application of the hydromulch treatment (Chapter7, Figure \n\n5). The land use had an effect on runoff production (runoff coefficient of 22% on the two \n\neucalypt sites vs. 56% on the pine site) but it was not a key factor in post-fire erosion risk \n\n(415 g m-2 for the unploughed eucalypt vs. 549 g m-2 for the pine site). At the eucalypt \n\nsites, the ploughing did not influence overland flow generation, whereas there were \n\nmarked differences on the erosion response (415 g m-2 for the unploughed compared to \n\n125 g m-2 on the pre-fire down-slope ploughed). Additionally, at the pine site, the \n\nhydromulch significantly reduced both variables, whereas plot size (0.25, 0.5, 10 m2) did \n\nnot have significant differences in the hydrological or soil erosion response. Invariably, the \n\npine treated plots generated the lowest runoff amounts but only similar specific sediment \n\nlosses compared to the down-slope ploughed eucalypt site. \n\nLower hydrological and soil erosion response in pine compared to eucalypt stands \n\nhad been reported earlier in North-Central Portugal (Prats et al., 2012; Shakesby et al., \n\n1996). It was attributed to lower soil water repellency levels and to the presence of a pine \n\nneedle \u201ccarpet\u201d. Actually, overall soil water repellency levels at the untreated pine site \n\nwere much lower than at the eucalypt sites (median \u201c0\u201d ethanol class vs. median \u201c7\u201d \n\nethanol class, respectively; Figure 6) but those lower repellency levels did not produce \n\nlower runoff generation. In addition, the logging at the pine site caused the removal of the \n\nprotective litter cover (mean litter cover 5% just after logging). The few studies that have \n\nmonitored the first post-fire year runoff and sediment losses, on unlogged pine sites in \n\nPortugal (Table 2; Prats et al., 2012; Ferreira et al., 2008 and Shakesby et al., 1996), \n\nfound lower runoff coefficient (6-16% versus 56%) and sediment losses (38-220 vs. 302 g \n\nm-2) than the Colmeal pine site. In fact, these studies differed mainly in soil cover (they \n\nreported more than 50% of needle carpet), which could reflect a difference in the \n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central \nPortugal \n\n154 \n \n\nmonitored time since fire, in fire intensity or in the disturbance caused by logging. \n\nProbably due to logging, the pine site had higher runoff coefficient and sediment losses \n\nthan previous Portuguese studies but lower rates compared to other studies outside the \n\nMediterranean region (Shakesby, 2011). In agreement with the soil cover importance in \n\nreducing runoff and sediment losses, the hydromulching effectiveness was attributed to \n\nthe increase of soil cover. The present study results coincided with other experiments with \n\npost-fire mulch (Prats et al., 2012; Bautista et al., 1996; Shakesby et al., 1996). \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

In fact, increases in the specific sediment losses by plot of 5 to 10-fold were \n\ndescribed at both logged sites. Fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2007) also found that logging operations \n\naffect soil erosion mainly through changes in the significant exposure of bare soil.  \n\n \n\nFigure 6. Frequency of topsoil (soil surface + 2-3 cm) water repellency levels at eucalypt (two \n\npost-fire years) and pine sites (one post-fire year). \n\nAt the eucalypt sites, the contrasting pre-fire soil preparation techniques were not a \n\nkey factor on post-fire hydrological response (Figure 7a). However, the pre-fire ploughed \n\nareas consistently showed the lowest specific sediment losses figures (below 0.20 g m-2 \n\nmm rain-1); either with natural rainfall, high or extreme intensity simulated rainfall (Figure \n\n7b). These facts suggested that erosion at the three ploughed sites was sediment limited. \n\nIn a recently rip-ploughed eucalypt site, Shakesby et al., (1994) found specific sediment \n\nlosses as high as 3.27 g m-2 mm-1 rain. They also estimated that sediment losses decline \n\nrapidly following rip-ploughing due to the formation of a stone lag and the development of \n\nthe protective vegetation and litter cover. The decline in sediment losses could also be \n\nrelated with the selective removal of the fine soil fraction by the initial soil erosions events \n\n(Walsh et al., 1995). However, unequivocal lower fine fraction or higher stone cover in all \n\nthe ploughed compared to the unploughed sites was not observed. The time elapsed \n\nsince ploughing (as much as 20 years or 2 eucalypt production cycles, judging by the \n\nremaining tree stumps) could be related with the low sediment rates registered on all the \n\nploughed sites. So, sediment exhaustion was probably a consequence of severe initial \n\nerosion periods which occurred just after ploughing.

Even because, in commercial \n\neucalypt stands, ground preparation involving uprooting the old stumps would be needed \n\nat least every 30-40 years (3-4 eucalypt cycles) (Shakesby et al., 1996) and recently is \n\nalso often done after the fire. This ground preparation usually involves rip-ploughing \n\n(down-slope or contour) and even slope engineering (terracing), which compromise the \n\nsoil conservation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nOverall discussion and general conclusions \n\n157 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.

However, the specific sediment losses range (0.07-0.33 g \n\nm2 mm-1 rain) can only be compared with the most erosive unploughed site (0.40 g m2 mm-\n\n1 rain), while the ploughed site (0.12 g m2 mm-1 rain) corresponded to their minimum \n\nrange. These results can suggest either that our measurements were comparatively low \n\n(plot size effect) or that our results can be compared. In the latter case, rill erosion did not \n\ntake place on their 16 m2 plots, inter-rill erosion being the main process in all the three \n\nstudies. Outside Portugal, other post-fire studies carried out using 8 m2 plots in burnt \n\neucalypts stands in Australia showed higher erosion rates. Dragovich and Morris (2002) \n\nand Blong et al. (1982) found specific sediment losses of 0.39 g m-2mm-1 rain to 1.08 g m-\n\n2mm-1 rain (Table 2). Only the unploughed site values can be compared to their minimum \n\nrange, although comparison is limited by differences in historic land use and the wild \n\nnature of eucalypt forest in Australia.  \n\nRSE\u2019s in burnt eucalypt stands in Portugal were done only in one study by Leighton-\n\nBoyce et al., (2007). They used a similar set up as here (100 mm h-1 applied rainfall \n\nintensity in a ploughed site), although their study was done in a single moment after fire \n\ninstead of the repeated RSE\u2019s approach used in the present thesis. The runoff coefficient \n\nreported by them (70 %) was 2-4 times higher than the measured range at the ploughed \n\nsites (15- 49 %), but their specific sediment losses (0.63 g m-2 mm-1 rain) were 5-10 times \n\nhigher than the present study values (0.04 -0.15 g m-2 mm-1 rain; Table 2). Other RSE\u2019s \n\nstudies in Portugal were done at pine sites (Ferreira et al., 2005a; Coelho et al., 2004 and \n\nWalsh et al., 1998) also in a unique moment after fire. Their runoff coefficients were \n\ncomparable to the present study values (5-65%) but in terms of sediment losses, they \n\nshowed much higher values than those registered at the unploughed and unploughed + \n\nlogged sites (0.3 to 1.67 g m-2mm-1 rain vs. 0.31 -0.39 g m-2mm-1 rain; Table 2). Repeated \n\nRSE\u2019s after wildfires were carried out in Australia in eucalypt forests (Sheridan et al., \n\n2007; during three years) and in Aleppo Pine in Eastern Spain (Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2005; \n\nduring 11 years). To allow comparison, their results for the two first post-fire years have \n\nbeen summarized in Table 2. Although runoff generation between studies was \n\ncomparable, even the highest specific sediment losses registered at the unploughed sites \n\n(0.4 g m-2mm-1 rain) were three times and roughly twelve times lower than the highest \n\nones measured by Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2005 (1.32 g m-2mm-1 rain)  and Sheridan et al., \n\n2007 (4.88 g m-2mm-1 rain ) respectively. \n\nTo summarize, the low recorded erosion rates coincide with the generally lower \n\nMediterranean erosion rates as compared to other areas. This is mainly attributed to the \n\n\n\nOverall discussion and general conclusions \n\n159 \n \n\nhigh soil stoniness, shallow soils as well as long intensive land use (Shakesby 2011, \n\nCerdan et al., 2010). The lower erosion rates do not necessarily mean that erosion is a \n\nlesser threat for the soil resource, as the soil is already thin, any additional loss may be \n\nconsidered detrimental (Cerdan et al., 2010).  \n\nOn other hand, the organic matter fraction on the eroded sediments was high (40-60 \n\n%) when compared with its content on the top soil (5-10 %); independently of land use, \n\npre and post-fire management, and measurement technique. The bulk of the studies do \n\nnot present separate data on mineral and organic matter losses. However, Prats et al., \n\n(2012), Thomas et al., (1999) and Fern\u00e1ndez et al., (2007) also found high organic matter \n\nlosses (40-50 %). These high values can be related to moderate fire severity; once that \n\nthe incomplete combustion could allow the presence of substantial amounts of charcoal \n\nover the soil surface. Furthermore, high organic matter contents in the sediments seemed \n\nto be consistent with low soil losses (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007). The large fraction of organic \n\nmatter not only compromises the soil fertility, but also has consequences for off-site \n\npollution (Campos et al., 2012; Vila-Escal\u00e9 et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central Portugal \n\n160 \n \n\nTable 2.

The decreasing rates are due to the transition from transport- to \n\nsediment-limited erosion typically reported by post-fire erosion studies (see Shakesby, \n\n2011; Shakesby and Doerr, 2006). The temporal variability had also been associated with \n\ninter and intra-annual rainfall variability and post-fire vegetation recovery (Shakesby et al., \n\n1993; 1994, 1996). Independently of the land use, soil preparation technique and \n\nmeasurement methodology, the observed temporal patterns (two post-fire years) did not \n\ncorrespond to a simple decrease with time, but had a marked seasonal component.  As a \n\nresult, higher runoff coefficient and specific sediment losses values surrounding the driest \n\nseasons were observed. During these periods, at both eucalypt and pine sites, the weekly \n\nrunoff and specific sediment losses were as high as the initial values measured \n\nimmediately after the wildfire (see Chapter 2, 3, 4 and 5; Figures 3, 6, 4 and 5 and 3, \n\nrespectively). The temporal patterns in the pine hydromulched plots were somewhat \n\nsimilar, but with smaller amplitudes. On the other hand, the hydromulch effectiveness to \n\nreduce runoff and sediment losses lasted for three post-fire years. Although the \n\nhydromulch cover decayed after the second winter, it was compensated for the vegetation \n\nrecovery. At both logged sites, the logging disturbance impact over the sediment losses \n\nwas larger than the time since fire. So, just after logging the specific sediment losses \n\nincreased sharply, but two years after the fire the specific sediment losses reached similar \n\nfigures to just after fire. Since RSE\u2019s avoid the variability of natural rainfall, they were \n\nuseful to compare results obtained at different moments in time after fire. The two prior \n\nstudies that also employed repeated RSE\u2019s to study post-fire runoff and erosion (Cerd\u00e0 \n\nand Doerr, 2005; Sheridan et al., 2007), reported pronounced decreases in inter-rill \n\nerosion rates with time-since-fire. The decrease in overland flow and erodibility was \n\nrelated to the degree and type of vegetation cover as well as its influence over the soil \n\nhydrophobicity (Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, 2005). Equally, the repeated RSE\u2019s carried out at six \n\neucalypt sites confirmed the fact that time had a significant influence over the runoff and \n\nerosion response. However, RSE\u2019s executed two years after the fire measured specific \n\nsediment losses as high as the initial RSE\u2019s.  \n\nConsequently, for all seven sites and measurement techniques a risk of enhanced \n\nrunoff and erosion response was observed two years after the fire, probably due to the \n\nsoil water repellency effect increasing runoff generation and the observed slow and \n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central \nPortugal \n\n164 \n \n\nsparse post-fire vegetation recovery (mean vegetation cover two years after the fire was \n\n28 % for untreated pine plots and about 40 % for the eucalypt sites).  \n\n \n\n7.3 Key factors explaining runoff and erosion \n\n \n\nOverland flow generation analysis, and the role therein of several factors, represented \n\na focus since the total sediment losses of the 132 RSE\u2019s, as well as the eucalypt and pine \n\nnatural rainfall plots (n=1584), were strongly correlated to runoff volumes (Spearman's \n\nrank correlation coefficient 0.90\u20130.95; p &lt;0.01).  \n\nMultiple regression models for the weekly runoff measurements under natural rainfall, \n\nin the eucalypt (Chapter 4; Table 5) and in the untreated pine plots (Chapter 5; Table 4), \n\nrevealed that rainfall amount was the main factor explaining runoff generation. This was \n\nfollowed by surface cover factors (litter, ash, vegetation) related either to an increase in \n\nthe resistance to flow and or the interception capacity (Smets et al, 2008). A shift in the \n\nfirst descriptor from rainfall amount toward rainfall intensity was detected as surface cover \n\nincreases over the plots. Differences between the partial regression models of the \n\nunploughed and down slope ploughed (with higher protective surface cover) eucalypt \n\nsites, as well as untreated and hydromulched plots highlighted that shift. Prats et al., \n\n(2012) described the same alteration on the first descriptor between eucalypt and pine \n\nplots (with high needle carpet cover) regression models. Equally, Vega et al., (2005) over \n\nplots with high vegetation cover (37% immediately after a prescribed fire) found rainfall \n\nenergy (accumulated kinetic energy) to be the main factor for runoff generation.  \n\nThe results confirm the effect of the seasonal and spatial variation of soil water \n\nrepellency on runoff generation addressed by other authors in the same region (Prats et \n\nal., 2012; Malvar et al., 2011; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2007; Keizer 2005a; Ferreira et al., \n\n2000). However, this effect on runoff generation is not consistent. The overall soil water \n\nrepellency levels alone are not sufficient to assess the whole impact of repellency. \n\nActually, the runoff coefficient was lower at the more hydrophobic eucalypt sites \n\n(frequency of not wettable measurements 70-80 %) compared to the untreated pine plots \n\n(frequency of not wettable measurements 20-40 %), (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Despite that, \n\nthe regression model indicated that soil water repellency explained better runoff \n\ngeneration at the more hydrophobic sites. Soil water repellency represented the second \n\nfactor explaining runoff variation (11%) at the eucalypt sites, whereas at the pine site was \n\n\n\nOverall discussion and general conclusions \n\n165 \n \n\ndetected only through the negative sign in the soil moisture parameter estimate. At the \n\neucalypt sites, further insight on the soil water repellency role was provided through the \n\npartial models of runoff generation under different repellency conditions. As the soil was \n\nmore hydrophobic there was a shift from rainfall intensity to rainfall amount as the main \n\nfactor controlling overland flow. At the same time, the importance in the protective-\n\ninterception layer (litter+ ash) was decreasing. As a consequence, under repellent \n\nconditions, medium rainfall intensity events (I15 = 20 mm h\n-1) were able to generate \n\nenough overland flow to transport sediments even with high protective cover.  \n\nIn agreement with previous studies employing repeated RSE\u2019s (Cerd\u00e0 and Doerr, \n\n2005; Sheridan et al., 2007), the RSE\u2019s temporal patterns of overland flow cannot be \n\nattributed only to changes in soil water repellency. The observed changes in overland flow \n\ngeneration between RSE\u2019s campaigns coincided well with changes in soil water \n\nrepellency assessed by means and/or with the frequency of extreme repellency (ethanol \n\nclass>7) (see Chapter 3: Figures 6 and 7). However, there were exceptions in which low \n\nrunoff generation was associated to strong soil water repellency levels. This could be \n\nattributed to the role of antecedent rainfall, enhancing the spatial variability in repellency \n\nand, thereby, creating opportunities for re-infiltration (e.g. Shakesby et al., 2000; Keizer et \n\nal., 2005a). This could also be attributed to the fact that the soil water repellency \n\nmeasurements were destructive and, thus, were not carried out in the RSE\u2019s plots \n\nthemselves but in neighbouring plots. On the other hand, descriptors such as median \n\nethanol class, its range or frequency of a soil water repellency class, might not fully \n\ncapture the hydrological implications of soil water repellency, especially under \n\nheterogeneous repellency conditions. \n\nAt both eucalypt sites, multiple regression models showed that sediment losses were \n\ncontrolled mainly by rainfall intensity followed by litter cover. The relationship of sediment \n\nlosses with runoff generation was represented by the presence of variables that were \n\nproved to affect runoff (soil water repellency, soil moisture, and ash cover). Previous \n\nstudies have also reported the importance of rainfall intensity in determining post-fire \n\nsediment losses (Prats et al., 2012; Robichaud et al., 2008; Spigel and Robichaud 2007; \n\nVega et al., 2005; Fernandez et al., 2004). In contrast, at the pine site, the first explaining \n\nfactor was always a cover related variable, either organic cover (hydromulch + litter + \n\nvegetation) or bare soil depending in the treatment specific models. The results enhance \n\nthe importance of increasing the soil cover for a successful control of soil erosion. Bare \n\nsoil exposure related to fire intensity (Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald, 2005) or post-\n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central \nPortugal \n\n166 \n \n\nfire logging operations (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2007) had previously been found to explain \n\nsediment losses variability. In agreement with that, the increase after logging in specific \n\nsediment losses by plot of 5 to 10-fold, at the pine and the eucalypt sites respectively, was \n\nrelated to the marked decrease in litter cover after logging disturbance. Although \n\nincrements in sediment losses after clear-cutting had been reported for unburnt forest \n\n(e.g. Croke et al., 1999; Powers, 2002; Hartanto et al., 2003), the research on post-fire \n\nlogging is less frequent (Fernandez et al., 2007). Independently of the origin (low fire \n\nintensity, post-fire treatment) the contribution to reducing soil erosion of the cover-related \n\nvariables has already been documented (Bautista et al., 1996; Prats et al., 2012; \n\nRobichaud et al., 2000; Shakesby et al., 1996; Wagenbrenner et al., 2006). The results \n\nagree well with those findings highlighting the importance of surface cover variables to \n\nmitigate post-fire soil erosion. As a consequence, from a soil conservation point of view, \n\nland managers are strongly encouraged to cautiously carry out logging activities, taking \n\ninto account the importance of keeping the needles and the logging litter over the soil. \n\n \n\n7.4 Natural versus simulated rainfall \n\n \n\nNatural and simulated rainfall experiment measurements were equal in terms of study \n\nsites, post-fire monitored period, plot size and plot experimental design (Chapters 2 and \n\n4). Since total rainfall amount and intensity were very different between both \n\nmethodologies, the absolute runoff and erosion values can hardly be contrasted (Table 3). \n\nHowever, relative differences between them were well represented, both natural and \n\nsimulated rainfall results reported that both sites had comparable runoff amounts but the \n\nsediment losses at the pre-fire ploughed site were significantly lower. On the other hand, \n\nthe organic matter fraction of the eroded sediments was around 40-50%, independently of \n\nthe site and methodology. Once divided by rainfall amount, both techniques results could \n\nbe better assessed. At both sites, the runoff coefficient was consistently higher (roughly \n\ndouble) under simulated compared to natural rainfall, possibly reflecting the higher \n\nsimulated rainfall intensity (Table 3). Sediment exhaustion at the ploughed site was \n\npointed out as the cause underlying the lack of differences in specific sediment losses \n\nbetween natural, extreme and high intensity RSE\u2019s (ca. 0.07 g m2 mm-1 rain) (Figure 8). \n\nSimilarly, sediment exhaustion at the other ploughed eucalypt sites was also recorded by \n\nthe RSE\u2019s erosion results. The specific sediment losses ranged from 0.05 to 0.20 g m2 \n\nmm-1 rain, and varied very little between high and extreme intensity RSE\u2019s (see Figure \n\n\n\nOverall discussion and general conclusions \n\n167 \n \n\n7b). In contrast, when sediments are available, the extreme intensity RSE\u2019s recorded \n\ncomparatively high sediment losses. So, at the unploughed site the extreme intensity \n\nRSE\u2019s (0.31 g m2 mm-1 rain) were able to capture similar specific sediment losses \n\ncompared to the natural rainfall plots (0.35 g m2 mm-1 rain) (Figure 8). Equally, extreme \n\nintensity RSE\u2019s at the logged eucalypt site captured the values recorded with natural \n\nrainfall plots at the logged pine site (ca. 0.50 g m2 mm-1 rain; see Figure 5b and Figure \n\n7b). \n\nTable 3.

The different soil \n\npreparation techniques did not show a clear trend in soil water repellency levels (Figure \n\n10). Although some caution is required in comparing the data because the sites\u2019 sampling \n\ndates were not the same, the lack of relationship between the ploughing and soil water \n\nrepellency levels was probably related to the time elapsed since ploughing. In the same \n\nregion, Shakesby et al. (1993) suggested that deep-ploughing can render previously \n\nhydrophobic soils hydrophilic. Doerr et al. (1998) found that the hydrophilic nature of the \n\nsoil recently ploughed was only temporary (as short as two years) until the planted \n\neucalyptus trees grow and provide inputs of hydrophobic substances from the litter and \n\nroot development. Further research in the area suggested that recently rip-ploughed areas \n\ncan become repellent in a period as short as six months (Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005). \n\nSoil burning could also affect the soil water repellency levels, but the effects of burning \n\ncan be highly variable, depending mainly on the type of organic matter consumed, the soil \n\nheating and the amount of oxygen available during burning (Doerr et al., 2009a). Besides \n\nthis, eucalypt stands constitute a somewhat unusual case in which the long unburned \n\nstands can show similar repellency levels compared to the recently burned stands (Doerr \n\net al., 1998). On the other hand, since fire severity was classified as moderate in all the \n\neucalypt stands, to attribute the observed post-fire water repellency spatial pattern to a \n\nfire-related component was not possible. Although, wildfire severity was classified through \n\nthe use of simple indicators such as canopy and shrub twigs consumption, ash colour, etc \n\n(see Chapter 3, Table 1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nOverall discussion and general conclusions \n\n171 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10.

Measurements were done at six \n\nfield campaigns carried out in two post-fire years or one post-fire year in the case of unploughed + \n\nlogging and unploughed_SI sites. Number of observations is shown in brackets. \n\nA seasonal cycle of low soil water repellency conditions during the wet winter and \n\ngreater repellency during the dry periods have been reported for unburnt and burnt \n\neucalypt plantations in Portugal (Doerr and Thomas 2000; Ferreira et al., 2000; Keizer et \n\nal., 2005a; Leighton-Boyce et al., 2005; Prats et al., 2012) and for other vegetation types \n\naround the world (Doerr et al., 2000). All six eucalypt sites showed overall strong to \n\nextreme soil water repellency median values, but non-repellent conditions also occurred, \n\nrevealing rainfall-related seasonal variations (see Chapter 3; Figure 7). The more frequent \n\n(2-weekly interval) soil water repellency measurements, at 2-3 and 7-8 cm depth, in the \n\nunploughed_AI and down-slope ploughed eucalypt site also showed a seasonal pattern \n\n(see Chapter 6; Figure 2). Although it was not possible to give the precise time required \n\nfor repellency to break down or become re-established, strong changes in repellency level \n\nwere observed within a period of two weeks. At the unploughed_A1 site, spatially \n\nhomogenous transitions, i.e. from entirely extreme repellent (median ethanol class 8; \n\ninter-quartile range =0) to entirely wettable (median ethanol class 0; inter-quartile range \n\n=0) occurred within 22 days. The opposite, i.e. change from entirely non-repellent (median \n\nethanol class 0; inter-quartile range =0) to entirely extreme repellent conditions (median \n\nethanol class 8; inter-quartile range =0) occurred within 15 days.

(2005b: 3\u20134 weeks) and Leighton-Boyce et al. (2005: 22 days) \n\nand Crockford et al. (1991: 6\u20139 days). The rapid change over such short time intervals \n\nimplies that an adequate description of the temporal dynamics of water repellency under \n\nfield conditions requires frequent sampling, especially during soil wetting and drying \n\nphases, and when the assessment of the hydrological soil water repellency impact is a \n\ngoal. \n\nIn addition to the temporal dynamics, the spatial variability between sites was irregular \n\nin time, and poorly related to overall values. In spite of the overall very strong repellency \n\nlevels in the unploughed and ploughed eucalypt sites, there was a shift from less soil \n\nwater repellency in the unploughed site in the first post-fire year, to more repellent during \n\nthe second year (Figure 11). Since fire severity was moderate in both cases and rainfall \n\npatterns were the same, the spatial differences in soil moisture content can be the cause \n\nunderlying the observed differences between sites. Overall soil moisture content was \n\nhigher at the less repellent unploughed than ploughed site (7.3 vs. 5.8 vol. %) during the \n\nfirst year, whereas the opposite was true during the second (6.7 vs. 9.4 vol. %). However, \n\nthe soil moisture alone is insufficient to explain the observed temporal fluctuations and/or \n\nspatial differences in water repellency levels. An inverse relationship of soil moisture and \n\nsoil water repellency had been observed for eucalypt sites in the region (Walsh et al., \n\n1994; Doerr and Thomas 2000; Coelho et al., 2005; Keizer et al., 2005a; Leighton-Boyce \n\net al., 2005). Above a certain moisture content (i.e. critical threshold), a repellent soil \n\nbecomes entirely wettable (Dekker and Ritsema 1994; Soto et al. 1994; Doerr et al. 2009). \n\nAfterwards, Dekker et al. (2001) revised the concept suggesting that, a transition zone \n\ncould be more appropriate, rather than a distinct threshold separating wettable and \n\nrepellent conditions. The transition zone detected in this study for the two post-fire years \n\nwas at lower soil moisture content at the unploughed than ploughed site (8-12 vs. 10-14 \n\nvol. %; Figure 12). These results implied that the unploughed site maintained hydrophilic \n\nconditions at lower soil moisture figures than the ploughed site. In both cases, the soil \n\nmoisture range was narrower than the 14-27 vol. % described by Leighton-Boyce et al., \n\n2005 in a mature eucalypt site of the region. The results agree with previous findings in \n\nthe detection of a transition zone (Doerr et al., 2000; Dekker et al., 2001; Leighton-Boyce \n\net al., 2005) and also with the fact that temporal and spatial water repellency patterns \n\ncannot be explained only by the soil moisture content. \n\n\n\nOverall discussion and general conclusions \n\n173 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 11.

Post-fire runoff amounts at the seven study sites tended to be comparable to \n\nthose reported by other studies in and outside Portugal. The associated sediment losses, \n\nhowever, were low compared to those found by earlier studies, not only in Portugal but \n\nespecially in other parts of the world. Even so, the present sediment losses must be \n\nappreciated against a background of typically shallow soils, presumably, reflecting a long \n\nhistory of intensive land use and, in recent decades, a high recurrence of wildfires. The \n\norganic matter contents of the eroded sediments were consistently high (50%), both \n\nacross the various study sites and throughout the 1- to 2-year study periods. Whilst \n\norganic matter losses by post-fire runoff have received little research attention, they do \n\nseem of crucial importance for fire-induced soil fertility losses and pollution of downstream \n\naquatic habitats. \n\n2. Contrary to what was expected based on prior research, the pine study site \n\ngenerated more overland flow than the unploughed eucalypt site but similar sediment \n\nlosses. The present results, however, did not allow clarifying whether this was due to \n\ndifferences in land cover (pine vs. eucalypt) or in post-fire forestry operations (salvage \n\nlogging vs. natural regeneration). Even so, salvage logging did increase sediment losses \n\nat the pine site, as was also suggested by the rainfall simulation experiments that were \n\ncarried out at another eucalypt study site. These increases in sediment losses after \n\nlogging could be explained by disturbance of the protective litter cover and the resulting \n\nincrease in bare soil cover. As a precautionary principle, post-fire logging activities should \n\ntherefore pay due attention to maintaining or promoting a protective litter cover, as for \n\nexample provided by the needle cast from scorched pine canopies or by logging residues. \n\n3. The three eucalypt study sites that had been ploughed (prior to the last wildfire) \n\nproduced similar amounts of overland flow but lower sediment losses than the three \n\neucalypt study sites that appeared never to have been ploughed. This difference in \n\nsediment losses was attributed to sediment exhaustion, resulting from enhanced erosion \n\nfollowing ploughing. At the same time, however, post-fire sediment losses did not differ \n\nmarkedly between the three types of ploughing operations studied here. This was \n\nsomewhat surprising, as contour ploughing and terracing are commonly advocated as soil \n\n\n\nOverall discussion and general conclusions \n\n175 \n \n\nconservation techniques, whilst down-slope ploughing has been found to markedly \n\nincrease erosion rates. A probable reason was that the erosion impacts of ploughing were \n\nshorter-lived than the time that had elapsed since the ploughing. Since especially \n\nterracing is becoming an increasingly widespread practice in the study region, it would \n\nseem urgent to address in more detail its implications for land-use sustainability.  \n\n4. Hydro-mulching was highly effective in reducing runoff and sediment losses \n\nduring the first 19 months following its application in a recently logged pine stand. The key \n\nfactor explaining this effectiveness was the elevated protective soil cover that was first \n\nprovided by the hydro-mulch alone but, in later stages, in combination with litter and \n\nvegetation cover. Besides litter and vegetation cover, hydro-mulching has an effect on \n\ntopsoil moisture content and topsoil water repellency, these changes also played a role in \n\nreducing runoff. \n\n5. During the first two years after the wildfires, time-since-fire had a marked effect \n\non overland flow generation and the associated sediment losses. This effect was \n\nobserved at all study sites, independent of their land cover or pre-fire land management, \n\nand for both measurement techniques (rainfall simulation experiments and runoff-erosion \n\nplots). The observed temporal patterns, however, did not correspond to a simple decrease \n\nin runoff or erosion with time-since-fire. In general, clear peaks in runoff and erosion \n\noccurred following dry seasons or dry spells. These peaks could often be explained by \n\nelevated levels of soil water repellency, associated to dry soil conditions and in the \n\nabsence of a vigorous regeneration of the understory and ground vegetation.  \n\n6. Rainfall amount and ground cover were the main factors explaining runoff \n\nvolumes, respectively for the eucalypt and pine sites. However, the specific models -\n\ncarried out independently at the ploughed and unploughed eucalypt sites, control and \n\nhydromulch plots at the pine site- revealed that the first factors were rainfall amount or \n\nintensity. Rainfall amount was the first variable on sites with low ground cover or during \n\nperiods of high soil water repellency, whereas rainfall intensity became the main factor on \n\nsites with high ground cover or during low soil water repellency conditions.  \n\n7. In general, sediment losses at the study sites were strongly correlated with runoff \n\nvolumes. In terms of independent variables, however, they could be explained best by \n\nrainfall intensity followed by cover-related parameters.  \n\n8. Comparison of post-fire runoff and erosion rates produced by simulated and \n\nnatural rain indicated that rainfall simulation experiments (RSE\u2019s) captured well key \n\n\n\nAssessing the combined effect of land management and wildfire on runoff and soil erosion in north central \nPortugal \n\n176 \n \n\naspects such as the difference between a ploughed and an unploughed eucalypt \n\nplantations, their specific sediment losses (i.e. per mm of runoff), and the organic matter \n\ncontent of the eroded sediments. Repeated RSE\u2019s furthermore evidenced the marked \n\nseasonal variations in runoff and sediment losses, and the apparent role therein of soil \n\nwater repellency.  \n\n9. Overall levels of soil water repellency during two years following a wildfire did not \n\nreveal an obvious impact of ploughing for two neighbouring eucalypt plantations, one \n\nploughed and one unploughed, possibly because the ploughing had occurred several \n\nyears before the wildfire. Differences in water repellency were observed between the two \n\nstudy sites but they were highly irregular through time. Furthermore, temporal patterns in \n\nwater repellency proved hard to capture, since significant changes were detected over \n\ntime intervals as short as 6 to 7 days. Soil water repellency levels were less strongly \n\ncorrelated with antecedent rainfall than with soil moisture content, but the latter \n\nrelationship is clearly of less import for the purpose of predicting water repellency. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n177 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n179 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAutoridade Florestal Nacional (AFN), 2011.
