Introduction\n\nA major problem in Brycon orbignyanus produc-\ntion is its high mortality rate during the larvae stage and \nduring development into the fingerling stage. Feeding \npreference of B. orbignyanus larvae consists of crusta-\n\ncean zooplankton, mainly Cladocera and insect larvae. \nAccording to Ceccarelli and Senhorini (1996), other fish \nlarvae should be placed together with B. orbignyanus \nlarvae in order to avoid cannibalism during the incuba-\n\n\n\nSipa\u00faba-Tavares, LH., Alvarez EJ. da S. and Braga, FM. de S.\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 68(1): 77-86, 200878\n\nTanks were half filled (0.23 m) and kept at the same level \nfor 5 days. They were then completed up to 0.45 m and \nwater was made to flow continuously through the tanks. \nLarvae were placed in the tanks 2 days after spawning.\n\nB. orbignyanus larvae in the current research origi-\nnated from the CEMIG breeding stock. Following pro-\ntocols by Woynarovich and Horvath (1985), recently \nhatched tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum (Curvier, \n1818)) were added to the 36 hatcheries to feed the B. \norbignyanus larvae and prevent cannibalism. Two types \nof food treatments were investigated: one containing ra-\ntion + zooplankton (TR) and another containing only \nzooplankton (TN). A supplementary diet containing 19% \ncrude protein was given to larvae in TR up to the 20th \nday; a pellet-shape ration, containing 20% crude protein \n(20 kg.d\u20131), was given as from the next day. The experi-\nment was conducted in duplicate (TN\n\n1\n; TN\n\n2 \n= only zoo-\n\nplankton, and TR\n1\n; TR\n\n2\n = ration + zooplankton).\n\nWater samples were analyzed daily, with a 1 L Van \nDorn bottle during the first week and then every four \ndays, in all of the tanks, until the end of experiment. \nTemperature, conductivity and pH were determined \nwith Corning temperature meter, Micronal B330 and \nMetrhon Herisau E 488, respectively. Transparency was \ndetermined by Secchi disk, dissolved oxygen, nitrite, ni-\ntrate, total phosphorus and orthophosphate were meas-\nured according to Golterman et al. (1978). Ammonia, \nchlorophyll-a, alkalinity and inorganic carbon were de-\ntermined according to Koroleff (1976), Nush (1980) and \nMackereth et al. (1978). Residence time was measured \nby the speed of water entrance into the tanks, assessing \ntime spent for 2 L water output, expressed in days, need-\ned for the total renewal of water volume in the tanks.\n\nFor quantitative and qualitative analysis of zooplank-\nton, samples were obtained with a 58 ?m mesh plank-\nton net and then preserved in 4% formalin. Zooplankton \norganisms were counted in Sedgewick Rafter Cell and \nexamined under 100x magnification. Copepoda nauplii \nand copepodids of Argyrodiaptomus furcatus Cowgill \net al. (1985) and Notodiaptomus iherinig (Wright, 1935); \nwere counted together; density data were expressed in \nabundance percentage and individuals.m\u20133. Frequency \noccurrence was also estimated for total zooplankton or-\nganisms, divided into four classes: class 4 (very frequent, \nfrom 76 to 100%), class 3 (frequent, between 51 and \n75%), class 2 (moderately frequent, between 26 and \n50%) and class 1 (low frequency, between 1 and 25%). \n\nTen fish larvae were measured for total length with a \ngraded scale and weighed using a 1g-precision balance. \nLarvae were measured daily during the first week; later, \nthey were measured at a four-day interval, until the end \nof the experiment. \n\nTotal length and weight of B. orbignyanus larvae \nwere determined by minimum square methods (Santos, \n1978). Growth rates compared by method of treat-\nment were analyzed according to Gabriel\u2019s procedure \n(Sokal and Rohlf, 1981), using simultaneous compari-\nsons. Density of zooplankton organisms was evaluated \n\ntion period. After this phase B. orbignyanus larvae may \nbe transported to fishponds, although culture success de-\npends on the type and quantity of zooplankton available \nin the pond, larvae density and water quality. \n\nLopes et al. (1994) showed that supply of ration + \n zooplankton to Brycon cephalus Gunther, 1869 estab-\nlished higher survival rates, whereas larvae had high \ngrowth rates (length and weight) in zooplankton only \ntreatment. This fact confirmed the importance of live \nplankton as a basic component for fish initial feed. \n\nBrycon orbignyanus, commonly known as \u201cpira-\ncanjuba\u201d, is a species of great interest for fish farmers \ndue to its fast growth, food habits (omnivore), easy ad-\naptation to artificial diets, good flesh quality and for its \nuse in sport fishing. \u201cPiracanjuba\u201d is an indigenous spe-\ncies of the river Paran\u00e1 basin where it used to be found \nabundantly. However, due to deforestation, pollution and \nimpounding, the species has become rare in its natural \nhabitat (Mendon\u00e7a, 1996).\n\nPhysical, chemical and biological variables regulate \nthe functioning of larvae production tanks. Control of \nthe environment culture conditions is currently consid-\nered to be the main factor in production improvement. \nActually, the latter depends on management approaches, \non water quality monitoring and on knowledge of the \nspecies\u00b4 feeding habits. \n\nGreat variability in survival, growth and quality of \nhatchery-produced fish larvae is a common and complex \nproblem and mass mortalities may occur (Battaglene \net al., 2005). In spite of some recent encouraging results \ninvolving dispensed diets for fish larvae, the rearing of \nmost freshwater fish species still relies on live food, at \nleast up to metamorphosis. Zooplankton groups, such \nas Copepoda, Cladocera and Rotifera, are preys widely \nused in the rearing of fish larvae (Arag\u00e3o et al., 2004).\n\nHarvested zooplankton has regularly been used as \nlive food for larvae of freshwater fish species. The water \nquality control in larvae tanks and zooplankton as live \nfood affect variable growth and larval survival (Evjemo \net al., 2003).\n\nGiven the importance of the water variables condi-\ntions and available food in the development and survival \nof fish larvae, the current research evaluates the effects \nof two different food treatments (ration + zooplankton \nand only zooplankton) and water quality in tanks with \nBrycon orbignyanus larvae\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nThis study was undertaken at the Research Station \nand Environmental Development of Volta Grande \n(CEMIG, MG, Brazil), downstream the Volta Grande \nreservoir, and a water source for CEMIG tanks. Four \n8.49 m2 tanks were populated with Brycon orbignyanus \nlarvae, at a density of 94 larvae fish/m2, and were reared \nuntil the 41st day.\n\nThe tanks were left empty for 7 days before the \nexperiments and dolomitic lime (MgCO\n\n3\n) at 8 kg/tank \n\nand chicken dung (1000 g.m\u20132) at 9 kg/tank were added. \n\n\n\nWater quality and zooplankton in larvae tanks\n\nBraz.

J. Biol., 68(1): 77-86, 2008 83\n\nwhich triggered the re-suspension of the sediment. \nFurthermore, phosphorus compounds of food affect its \navailability in the environment: greater loss occurs when \nfood has a low conversion. Whereas nitrogen depends on \nseveral factors, fish excretion rates depend on the food \nrate, digestibility and availability (Pillary, 1992).\n\nLow chlorophyll-a concentration may be associated \nwith the water short residence time which will have re-\nstricted a long permanence of phytoplankton biomass in \nthe ponds. This fact influenced the low dissolved oxygen \nconcentrations due to the fact that oxygen consumption \nand phytoplankton production were more important than \ndiffusion processes. According to Gomes et al. (2000), \nBrycon can survive in water with low levels of dissolved \noxygen.\n\nShort residence time in ponds affected directly the \nzooplankton community, characterized by low species \ndiversity. However, short life-span organisms, such as \nRotifera, were ecologically better adapted to unforeseen \nchanges of the environment and, in the long run, become \ndominant. Probably associated with higher availability \nof nutrients in culture tanks, Rotifera represented more \n\ncorporation of these elements into the water column by \nalgal biomass, the concentration of nutrients in TR tanks \nwas higher. Since movement stirred by water input and \noutput in tanks causes more active nitrification, lower ni-\ntrite concentrations were reported when the latter were \ncompared to nitrate and ammonia concentration rates. \n\nSipa\u00faba-Tavares et al. (2000) also reported low ni-\ntrite and high nitrate concentrations in tilapia tanks with \nwater renewal. This fact demonstrated not only absorp-\ntion of the element by phytoplankton but also activities \nof nitrifying bacteria in fishponds.\n\nSince higher concentrations of orthophosphate and \ntotal phosphorus occurred in TR treatments, the direct \neffect of inert feed on the dynamics of nutrients has been \nindicated.

High Rotifera den-\nsity has been associated with the capacity of organisms \nto adapt themselves quickly to environmental disrup-\ntion and perturbation. In fact, prevalence in physically \nunstable systems, such as fishponds, has been the trend \n(Sipa\u00faba-Tavares and Colus, 1997).\n\nAccording to Sendacz and Kubo (1982), Calanoida-\nCopepoda is more abundant than Cladocera in oligo-\ntrophic waters, a characteristic of the water supplied to \nthe tanks. Lower abundance of Cladocera in tanks may \nbe associated with predation by B. orbygnianus larvae, \nwhich prefer zooplankton crustaceans, mainly Cladocera \n(Ceccarelli and Senhorini, 1996). In their study on sur-\nvival, growth and trophic dynamics in \u201cpiracanjuba\u201d lar-\nvae tanks, Senhorini and Fransozo (1998) verified that \nCladocera were preferentially ingested by the larvae \n\nCoupled to predation, high water transparency, low \ntemperatures and water flow are unfavorable factors to \nCladocera in fish tanks (Sipa\u00faba-Tavares and Colus, \n1997). Cladocera were more abundant only at the start \nof the experimental period when water temperature was \n\n\n\nWater quality and zooplankton in larvae tanks\n\nBraz. J.

Although Diaphanosoma birgei was the only dom-\ninant one among Cladocera, it was also the only zoo-\nplankton species classified as frequent in the tanks.\n\nAccording to Pereira et al. (2004), predominance \nof Diaphanosoma birgei in fish tanks is associated with \ncontinuous water flow, low dissolved oxygen and high \nphosphorus rates. High phosphorus rates in TR\n\n2\n affected \n\nthe high species density observed, since it represented \n88.6% of all Cladocera reported. \n\nThe water supply of the culture tanks came from an \noligotrophic reservoir and directly affected the Copepoda \ncommunity. In fact, the two Diaptomidae species, \nNotodiaptomus iheringi and Argyrodiaptomus furcatus, \nwere the most abundant. Thermocyclops decipiens, char-\nacteristic of mesotrophic and eutrophic environments \n(Sendacz and Kubo, 1982), represented a single occur-\nrence of a Cyclopoida species.\n\nZooplankton fluctuations are triggered by several \nfactors such as temperature, light and dark periods, water \nquality, food availability, competition and predation. In \nfish hatcheries, management may also modify the repro-\nductive cycles of these organisms and population succes-\nsion (Sipa\u00faba-Tavares and Colus, 1997).\n\nSurvival rates were low. Whereas only in treatment \nTN\n\n1\n a 48% survival occurred, survival rates were lower \n\nthan 28% in the other tanks. Lopes et al. (1994) dem-\nonstrated that supply of zooplankton plus ration caused \nhigher survival rates for Brycon cephalus. \n\nAccording to Battaglene et al. (2005), Rotifera were \na likely source of bacterial load to larval striped trum-\npeter (Latris lineata) in tanks. Moreover, Evjemo et al. \n(2003) verified that total protein in Calanoida-Copepoda \nwas higher than 50% of dry weight than that of Rotifera. \nIn the current experiment, Rotifera reached high den-\nsities and Copepoda, low densities. These factors may \nbe influenced by growth and survival results of Brycon \n orbignyanus larvae. Quantity and quality of available \nfood and the control of the culture water variations di-\nrectly affected the survival and performance of fish lar-\nvae. \n\nSince there was no difference between growth rates \nwithin the weight-length relationship, condition fac-\ntors of larvae in the treatments were similar (p > 0.05). \nCondition factors showed the fish well-being within a \ncertain environment and were associated with conditions \nin the allometric equation y = axb, adjusted to weight and \nlength data (Braga, 1997).\n\nPronounced fluctuation of organisms in Rotifera-\ndominant tanks has been reported, followed by Copepoda \nand Cladocera. Fluctuation in shallow artificial fish cul-\nture systems are probably associated with water flow, \nquantity of available food, chemical and physical chang-\nes of water and biological interactions including preda-\ntion and competition. Zooplankton was thus affected by \nshort life-span water residence which favored opportun-\nist species, such as Rotifera, and affected the survival of \nB. orbignyanus larvae in tanks.\n\nResults indicate some management recommenda-\ntions can be applied in the larvae culture station of Volta \nGrande (CEMIG) so that the survival of B. orbignyanus \nlarvae may be increased:\n\n1) Water flow decrease in tanks in order to retain \nphytoplankton biomass and consequently to \nincrease the quantity and quality of zooplankton \norganisms; water turbidity caused by planktonic \norganisms increases, light penetration is reduced \nand dissolved oxygen in the tanks is increased. \n\n2) Since the ration + zooplankton treatment (TR) \nshowed better results, this treatment should be \nrecommended for Brycon orbignyanus larvae.\n\n3) Deeper ponds may be used, since these systems \nare directly affected by local climate. \n\n4) In this study, water in the tanks was supplied by \nan oligotrophic reservoir characterized by low \nplankton densities; consequently, tank construction \nwith the sole aim to cultivate zooplankton as \na food reserve for B. orbignyanus larvae is \nrecommended.\n\nAcknowledgments \u2014 The authors would like to thank the \nBrazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development \n(CNPq) for its support with a scholarship to E.J. da S.
