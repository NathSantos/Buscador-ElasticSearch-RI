Several animals, including fish, use acoustic signals in early phases of disputes over territories or mates. Acoustic communication can be used during mutual assessment and help to avoid overt aggression, which can lead to severe body injuries or eventually to mortality. In this study we carried out playback experiments to test the function of agonistic sounds in territorial defence in a small marine goby. We measured the behaviour of individual males towards two nests placed in opposite sides of the aquarium, associated with either conspecific agonistic sounds or a control: silence or white noise. Sounds were played back interactively,\ni.e. a sequence of sounds was produced when the fish approached a nest. Additionally, we made similar experiments that also included visual stimuli that consisted of a conspecific male in a confinement aquarium near each nest. We registered the number of times the male approached, avoided, explored, entered and exited each nest type. In the silence vs sound treatment, males approached similarly nests associated with conspecific sounds or silent nests. However, males avoided nests associated with agonistic sounds more frequently than silent nests regardless of the presence of a nearby male. Further, males entered and exited nests associated with agonistic sounds more frequently than silent ones regardless of the absence/presence of visual stimuli. We found no significant effect of the playback treatment in any measured male behaviour when the control was white noise. The results suggest that agonistic sounds are effective in territorial defence in this species but the actual presence of a male actively guarding the nest is needed to prevent nest intrusion. Further, we can exclude the possibility that any sound may act as a deterrent in nest occupation.\nResumo\nNos diferentes ecossistemas, os machos de diversas esp\u00e9cies entram usualmente em confronto, motivados por v\u00e1rios factores como a escassez de algum recurso ou a competi\u00e7\u00e3o por territorio, ou mesmo pela necessidade natural de reproduzir, competindo assim pela aten\u00e7\u00e3o das f\u00eameas da mesma esp\u00e9cie. Estes comportamentos agon\u00edsticos est\u00e3o descritos em v\u00e1rios animais, estando uma s\u00e9rie deles relacionados com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de som. De acordo com diferentes estudos, estes podem ser emitidos em diversos contextos como a defesa do territ\u00f3rio, e consequente afastamento de poss\u00edveis advers\u00e1rios, ou mesmo como mecanismo de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o indirecta das condi\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsicas e de motiva\u00e7\u00e3o do oponente. Tal estrat\u00e9gia \u00e9 de extrema import\u00e2ncia, uma vez que atrav\u00e9s da mesma \u00e9 poss\u00edvel ao indiv\u00edduo evitar com que confrontos com outros machos evoluam para n\u00edveis de maior agressividade e, portanto, de maior custo energ\u00e9tico, que se se poderiam traduzir em graves ferimentos ou mesmo na sua morte. Para al\u00e9m disso, a energia poupada nesses confrontos pode depois ser utilizada de forma mais rent\u00e1vel noutras actividades biol\u00f3gicas de interesse da esp\u00e9cie, como os rituais de acasalamento e defesa activa do ninho e crias.\nTal situa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 igualmente observada nos peixes, em que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de som est\u00e1 associada a mecanismos de corte e de defesa territorial. Por\u00e9m, ao contr\u00e1rio do que acontece nos animais terrestres e devido \u00e0s diferen\u00e7as do meio em que habitam, nos peixes tal fen\u00f3meno est\u00e1 normalmente relacionado com a interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre a contrac\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00fasculos espec\u00edficos e estruturas de resson\u00e2ncia existentes no organismo do animal, ou ent\u00e3o em resultado da presen\u00e7a de estruturais corporais especializadas. A principal estrat\u00e9gia de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de som nos peixes consiste na contrac\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00fasculos s\u00f3nicos contra as paredes da bexiga-natat\u00f3ria do animal, existindo no entanto outros mecanismos, como a fric\u00e7\u00e3o de barbatanas espec\u00edficas ou mesmo a combina\u00e7\u00e3o simult\u00e2nea de diferentes processos em algumas esp\u00e9cies.\nAinda que se conhe\u00e7a a import\u00e2ncia dos sons na sobreviv\u00eancia de muitas esp\u00e9cies de peixes, em norma, este comportamento \u00e9 combinado com outras estrat\u00e9gias de forma a permitir uma postura agon\u00edstica mais eficaz, levando a uma maior probabilidade de sucesso na defesa do territ\u00f3rio. Assim, muitas vezes a sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 associada a uma s\u00e9rie de exibi\u00e7\u00f5es visuais, como varia\u00e7\u00f5es nas cores do peixe ou mesmo a erec\u00e7\u00e3o de barbatanas espec\u00edficas quando na presen\u00e7a de uma amea\u00e7a. Adicionalmente, tem-se conhecimento com base em estudo pr\u00e9vios de playbacks que, regra geral, os sons permitem uma avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das caracter\u00edsticas dos advers\u00e1rios sem que haja necessidade de um confronto directo entre os animais e um poss\u00edvel escalar de interac\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 situa\u00e7\u00f5es de maior desgaste energ\u00e9tico e f\u00edsico, como foi referido anteriormente. Assim, entende-se que alguns factores influenciam as caracter\u00edsticas dos sons produzidos pelo peixe, como sejam as suas dimens\u00f5es corporais, motiva\u00e7\u00e3o ou mesmo os n\u00edveis de hormonas que circulam no seu organismo.\nNeste estudo tivemos como objectivo avaliar a import\u00e2ncia destes sons numa esp\u00e9cie de peixe encontrado em \u00e1guas pouco profundas junto \u00e0 costa Portuguesa, Pomatoschistuspictus. A sua recolha foi realizada entre Janeiro e Abril do presente ano, durante mar\u00e9s-baixas, sendo posteriormente aclimatados em aqu\u00e1rios de stock existentes no laborat\u00f3rio. Posteriormente, realizamos diferentes tratamentos de playback recorrendo a sons agon\u00edsticos da mesma esp\u00e9cie e a dois tipos de controlo - sil\u00eancio e ru\u00eddo branco. Para tal usamos aqu\u00e1rios experimentais divididos em tr\u00eas compartimentos de iguais dimens\u00f5es, tendo colocado o macho a testar numa das divis\u00f5es (central) e dois ninhos artificiais nas restantes, os quais estariam associados a diferentes tipos de est\u00edmulos sonoros emitidos atrav\u00e9s de altifalantes colocados por tr\u00e1s dos mesmos. Desta forma pudemos observar a exist\u00eancia de uma poss\u00edvel prefer\u00eancia dos machos por ninhos \u2018ocupados\u2019 (i.e. associados a um est\u00edmulo ac\u00fastico) por oposi\u00e7\u00e3o a ninhos desocupados (silenciosos) ou associados a um controlo sonoro (ru\u00eddo\nbranco). O acesso aos ninhos estava inicialmente bloqueado pela exist\u00eancia de parti\u00e7\u00f5es laterais de pl\u00e1stico, que foram posteriormente removidas permitindo o acesso do peixe a todo o aqu\u00e1rio experimental. Nestas experi\u00eancias, denominadas de \u2018playback only\", os machos foram sujeitos a dois tipos de pr\u00e9-est\u00edmulo - um visual seguido de um sonoro - antes do per\u00edodo de teste. Durante este per\u00edodo os playbacks foram emitidos de forma interactiva, o que significa que sempre que o peixe se aproximou de um dos ninhos foram emitidos os tr\u00eas primeiros sons do est\u00edmulo sonoro respectivo. Adicionalmente, realizamos um outro tipo de experi\u00eancia - \u2018playback+visual - similar \u00e0 referida anteriormente mas \u00e0 qual associamos um est\u00edmulo visual. Desta forma, ap\u00f3s um pr\u00e9-est\u00edmulo sonoro, os machos foram expostos a dois indiv\u00edduos que se encontravam aprisionados num pequeno aqu\u00e1rio colocado, durante o per\u00edodo de teste, em cada um dos compartimentos laterais junto a cada um dos ninhos. Estes recipientes eram altos o suficiente para evitar a mistura da \u00e1gua do macho testado com a dos machos laterais evitando-se, desta forma, qualquer tipo de interac\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica entre os animais. O comportamento dos peixes foi gravado em cada sess\u00e3o recorrendo-se a uma c\u00e2mara de filmar, que permitiu a posterior an\u00e1lise individual dos diferentes comportamentos do macho em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao ninho ou, quando aplic\u00e1vel, ao est\u00edmulo visual. Assim procedeu-se \u00e0 contagem do n\u00famero total de aproxima\u00e7\u00f5es, evitamentos, explora\u00e7\u00f5es, entradas e sa\u00eddas dos ninhos ao longo do per\u00edodo de teste, possibilitando de seguida a an\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica dos mesmos dados, tendo-se em conta o tipo de tratamento de playback (controlo vs som), o tipo de experi\u00eancia (\u2018playback only\" ou \u2018playback+visuaV), e a interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre ambos os factores. Com este estudo pudemos ent\u00e3o observar que num primeiro tratamento de sil\u00eancio vs som os machos se aproximaram de forma significativa mais dos ninhos ac\u00fasticos do que dos associados a sil\u00eancio tendo, no entanto, evitado com maior frequ\u00eancia o lado associado ao som, independentemente da presen\u00e7a de um macho lateral. Foram tamb\u00e9m observados\nresultados significativos na entrada e sa\u00edda dos machos dos ninhos associados ao som, independentemente da exist\u00eancia ou aus\u00eancia de um est\u00edmulo visual associado. No entanto, a sua presen\u00e7a levou a resultados marginalmente significativos, que poderiam demonstrar a import\u00e2ncia deste tipo de est\u00edmulo na defesa territorial em Pomatoschistus pictus. Por sua vez, nas experi\u00eancias com controlo sonoro (i.e. ru\u00eddo branco) os resultados n\u00e3o foram significativamente relevantes, o que poderia estar relacionado com o n\u00famero reduzido de observa\u00e7\u00f5es neste tipo de tratamento. Verificamos ainda a possibilidade da exist\u00eancia de uma prefer\u00eancia do macho por um dos lados do aqu\u00e1rio consoante o tipo de tratamento, por\u00e9m os resultados obtidos n\u00e3o evidenciaram qualquer tipo de comportamento preferencial, apenas mostrando uma ligeira tend\u00eancia para passar mais tempo do lado do som em vez do lado do sil\u00eancio ou do controlo ac\u00fastico (ru\u00eddo branco). Os resultados obtidos sugerem que os sons agon\u00edsticos s\u00e3o uma estrat\u00e9gia importante e eficaz na defesa territorial da esp\u00e9cie considerada, mas que h\u00e1 uma necessidade conjunta da presen\u00e7a de um outro macho no ninho para motivar esta postura agressiva.\nPalavras-chave: sinais ac\u00fasticos, comportamento agon\u00edstico, defesa territorial, sinais \u2018keep-out\u2019, experi\u00eancias de playback, peixes tele\u00f3steos\nIntroduction\nIn nature, resources such as those needed for breeding are scarce and variable in their quality. Hence, in order to have a chance to reproduce, individuals (typically males) will compete intensely over these limited resources (Huntingford &amp; Turner, 1987; Andersson, 1994). This competition is often solved through confrontations that frequently start with mutual assessment characterized by low-level agonistic displays and are only expected to escalate to overt aggression if asymmetries between individuals in fighting ability and resource ownership are small (Huntingford &amp; Turner, 1987; Briffa &amp; Sneddon, 2007).\nLow-level aggressive behaviour involved in such contests is generally accompanied by sound production in a variety of different taxa (insects - Gerhardt &amp; Huber, 2002; fish - Ladich &amp; Myrberg, 2006; anurans - Davies &amp; Halliday, 1978; birds - Kort et al., 2009; and mammals -Clutton-Brock &amp; Albon, 1979).Generally, these sounds are the result of the passage of air driving the vibration of a membrane such a larynx or a syrinx, as found in frogs, birds and mammals (Ladich, 2004). However, in fish, sound production mechanisms are different from the ones presented by other taxa (Amorim &amp; Neves, 2008), and are usually characterized by specialized sonic muscles associated with resonating structures or by other modified body structures. One of the main type of mechanisms comprises the swimbladder and sonic muscles (Demski et al., 1973; Connaughton et al., 2000; Parmentier et al., 2006a), where muscle contraction leads to the production of sound, as seen for example in gadids (Hawkins &amp; Amorim, 2000) and batrachoidids (Skoglund, 1961; Fine et al., 2001). Other mechanisms include the the collision of the jaw teeth, as registered in clownfish (Parmentier et al., 2007), or several other strategies involving different and specialized body structures such as pectoral mechanisms, as the vibration of the pectoral girdle in sculpins or plucking of enhanced fin\nIn fish, like in other animals, sound plays an important role in territorial defence and usually accompanies physical modifications (Ladich &amp; Myrberg, 2006; Amorim &amp; Neves, 2008; Kierl &amp; Johnston, 2010), functioning as a complement to visual displays such as colour alterations or aggressive visual displays, including fin erection or quivering (Ladich &amp; Myrberg, 2006). Experimental evidence from muted specimens and playbacks (Valinsky &amp; Rigley, 1981; Riggio, 1981; Ladich et al., 1992a; Ladich 1998), suggests that in agonistic scenarios sounds can reveal valuable information about the opponent without the need of overt confrontation and, thus, energy depletion or even mortality (Enquist &amp; Leimar, 1983; Ladich &amp; Myrberg, 2006; Amorim &amp; Neves, 2008). For example, body size is often advertised by the production of longer sounds with lower dominant frequencies that result from larger body structures (Myrberg et al., 1993; Lobel &amp; Mann, 1995; Connaughton et al.,\n2000). Other factors which are known to affect sound production and its characteristics are fish motivation during a confrontation (Amorim, 2006), which may be directly related with breeding (Fine, 1978; Connaughton &amp; Taylor, 1995), and steroid circulating levels that may lead to different patterns or repetitions of sonic muscles contraction or a more vigorous stridulation of the fins (Fine &amp; Pennypacker, 1986; Brantley et al., 1993; Connaughton et al., 1997; Remage-Healey &amp; Bass, 2006).\nThough sound plays an extremely important role in some species communication and survival (Colleye et al., 2009), little is known about the role of acoustic signals in territorial defence in fish (Ladich &amp; Myrberg, 2006; Vasconcelos et al., 2010). In this study we aimed at examining\nthe role of agonistic sounds in territorial defence using as a model a small marine vocal species, the painted goby (Pomatoschistus pictus) that depends on nest defence for reproduction (Amorim &amp; Neves, 2008). We experimentally examined whether males occupied more readily unoccupied nests (silent) or nests associated with a sound control (white noise) than \u2018occupied\u2019 nests. We mimicked nest occupation by the use of interactive playbacks where males received a sequence of conspecific agonistic sounds whenever they approached a nest within a body length. We checked for several reactions of the subject male to unoccupied and \u2018occupied\u2019 nests, including avoiding, exploring and entering the nests. We further checked for readiness in nest occupation in a similar-design experiment that further used additional visual stimuli that consisted of a male in a confinement aquarium placed next to the nest. We predicted that males would take longer to occupy nests associated with conspecific sound and especially when in the presence of a conspecific male.\nMaterial and methods\nStudy species\nPomatoschistus pictus (Gobiidae, Teleostei) is a benthic fish that inhabits the coastal and shallow waters of the Eastern Atlantic and some areas of the Mediterranean, exhibiting a short life span of 2 years and up to 60 mm in length (Miller, 1986). Breeding season starts approximately in January until July, during which males display a very territorial behaviour, by building and protecting nests using small empty shells and other structures, and covering them with sand leaving only an opening (Miller, 1986; Bouchereau et al., 2003). Subsequently, females are attracted by male exhibitions, entering and laying their eggs on the top of the nest. These are then exclusively protected from predators by males until they hatch.\nFish collection and maintenance\nWe captured fish from January to April at Parede (38\u00b0 41\u2019N, 9\u00b0 21\u2019W) during low spring tides, at night time, and with the help of hand nets and flashlights, and at Arr\u00e1bida (38\u00b0 28\u2019N, 8\u00b0 58\u2019W) by scuba diving. In the laboratory we separated fish by gender and maintained them in stock 18 l aquaria (24x24x32 cm) equipped with sand substrate and shelters. These were fed with a closed-circuit flow of artificial filtered sea water kept at 16 \u00b0C and were under a photoperiod of 12L:12D. We fed the fish daily ad libitum with chopped shrimps. All experimental procedures complied with Portuguese animal welfare laws, guidelines and policies.\nExperimental procedure\n35 l glass experimental aquaria (26x51x31 cm) were divided in three equal compartments by clear or opaque partitions and presented the same substrate and water conditions as above. One subject was placed on the central division of the aquarium, 24 h prior the start of the test to allow it to become territorial. In each side compartments we placed one artificial PVC shelter (5.5 cm length and 3 cm inner diameter) partially covered with sand and one custom made speaker (see below). The speaker was protected with a plastic net to prevent fish from exploring the equipment during each test. We also placed a net on both lateral walls of the experimental aquarium to reduce the possibility of fish interacting with its own reflection.\nFigure 1 - Experimental setup during the visual pre-stimulus on the \u2018playback only\u2019 experiments. Lateral males were placed inside glass confinement aquariums (8x7x22 cm) between the nest and the side wall of the experimental aquarium (26x51x31 cm).\nStimulus males were matched in size, i.e. their standard length ratio was less than 10%. The confinement aquaria were high enough to prevent the mixture of the water from stimuli males with the one from the subject male, thus hindering chemical communication between specimens. During the \u2018playback+visual\u2019 experiment the confinement glass containers were\n0\t\to'\t\t0\n\t\t\t\t\ncP >\to\to'\to\tcT&lt;\n\t\t\t\t\nFigure 2 - Experimental setup during the test period on the \u2018playback+visual\u2019 experiments. Lateral males were placed inside glass confinement aquariums (8x7x22 cm) near the transparent partitions to increase visibility by the subject male placed in the central compartment of the experimental aquarium (26x51x31 cm).\nPart I: \u2018playback only\u2019\nCirca 15 minutes after we turned off all the equipment in the room, we started recording and removed the opaque partitions, leaving the transparent partitions for a total of 10 min, during which the subject fish in the central compartment had visual access to the lateral compartments. We finished this visual pre-stimulus by placing the opaque partitions back on and removing the lateral males, after which there was a silence period of 8 min followed by the emission of playback pre-stimulus with a total duration of 2 min. Afterwards all partitions\nSubject males were measured for standard length (SL) and weighted (W) after each test. A total of 12 gobies with SL ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 cm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD] = 3.7 \u00b1 0.18 cm) and W between 0.45 and 0.88 g (0.67 \u00b1 0.12 g) were tested on the first part of this study.\nPart II: \u2018playback+visual\u2019\nSimilar to the previous experiment, circa 15 minutes after we turned off all the equipment the experiment started by keeping subject males in silence on the central compartment of the aquarium for 5 min, while both opaque and transparent partitions were on. Subsequently, we started the emission of the playback pre-stimulus for 2 min, followed by the removal of the plastic partitions and observation of the behaviour of the fish towards the nests and the visual stimuli. A total of 14 different males were tested with a SL ranging from 3.4 to 3.9 cm (3.7 \u00b1\n0.16 cm) and W between 0.48 and 0.88 g (0.7 \u00b1 0.13 g).\nPlayback treatment\nTrials started with a sound pre-stimulus in which fish were exposed to conspecific aggressive sounds and a control, white noise (WN) or silence from opposite sides of the tank. When sound was emitted on both sides of the aquarium, we insured that the playback of agonistic sounds and WN did not overlap to avoid interference and masking. The playback treatment (silence vs sound or WN vs sound) on each trial was randomly selected prior the start of the test, as was the assignment of each of the acoustic stimulus to each side of the aquarium.\nAggressive sounds used on the playback treatments consisted of drums from three different males from our sound archive (2010) and each generated sequence comprised three different sounds from one male, i.e. there were three playback sequences. All files had the same length and acoustic energy, and spacing between sounds followed a typical pattern for this species observed in sound production during territorial defence. An identical number of WN files were created and shared the same properties (sound duration and sound intervals) as the drum sequences and were equalized to the same sound amplitude.\nPlayback experiments were performed using custom made speakers (Fonseca and Alves\n2012), which are able to reproduce low frequency pulsed fish sounds with great accuracy such\nas the ones emitted by the painted goby (Figure 3).\nFigure 3 - Oscillogram of a drum sound produced by the painted goby (a) or played by the speaker (b).\nThese were connected to a custom made amplifier (Fonseca and Alves 2012) fed through a D/A device (Edirol UA-25, Roland, Japan; 16 bit, 8 kHz) controlled by Adobe Audition 3.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), which allowed simultaneous two-channel recordings. The amplitude of the sound playback (drum or WN) was adjusted to mimic that of a painted goby male at 1-2 cm distance (c. 130 dB) with a hydrophone (Bruel &amp; Kj^r 8104, Bruel &amp; Kj^r, Naerum, Denmark, sensitivity -205 dB re1V/pPa). An additional hydrophone (High Tech 94 SSQ, High Tech Inc., Gulfport, MS, USA; sensitivity -165 dB re1V/pPa; frequency response within \u00b11 dB from 30 Hz to 6 kHz) was used on the playback experiments and kept on the central compartment of the experimental aquarium, to register any sound produced during trials.\nPlayback assays were interactive, i.e. every time the fish was within one body length (bl) from the nest we played the first three sounds of the correspondent playback treatment (sound or WN).\nBehavioural recording and analysis\nFish behaviour was recorded with a videocamera (Sony DCR-HC39, Sony, Tokyo, Japan) positioned 50 cm in front of the experimental tank and subsequently analysed with Etholog (v.2.2, Ottoni 2002). During the pre-stimuli, video recording captured the entire aquarium and then, during the test period, we focused on the tested male and its interactions with the nest or with the visual stimulus, when applicable. We registered the following behavioural parameters: approach, avoidance, explore, enter, and exit. Total time spent on each side of the aquarium and the first side explored by the fish were also registered. We only considered trials to be valid when the tested male approached at least one of the nests.\nStatistical analyses\nPlayback effects were analysed based on the different behaviours exhibited by the tested males, with and without visual stimulus. We carried out two-way ANOVAs to assess the influence of playback treatment (control vs sound) and experiment type: \u2018playback only' and \u2018playback+visual\u2019 on male nest-related behaviours: approach, avoidance, explore, enter and exit. We analysed the data separately for the playback treatments silence vs sound and WN vs sound.\nWe tested preference for sound or control sides of the experimental aquarium, with Wilcoxon non parametric tests where we considered the total time spent on each side during the test period. We further carried out Binomial tests to examine if fish first swam to the sound (or the control) side of the aquarium more often than expected by chance. The intention was to determine if there was a first preference based on the pre-stimuli playback treatment (silence vs sound or WN vs sound).\nStatistical analyses were conducted with Statistica (10, Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, USA) and all data was transformed when necessary to meet assumptions of the used parametric tests. When there was no normality of the transformed data, non-parametric tests were used.\nResults\nDuring acoustic pre-stimulus subject males seemed not to react to sound playback while the plastic partitions were on.

Interestingly, males avoided nests associated with agonistic drums more frequently than silent nests regardless of experiment type, i.e. \u2018playback only\u2019 and \u2018playback+visual\u2019 (Table 1, Figure 4b). We found no significant differences between the exploring behaviour towards silent or acoustic nests or between experiment types, but males entered and exited nests with sound more frequently than silent ones regardless of the absence/presence of visual\nstimuli (Table 1, Figures 4c, d). However, the interaction terms between the variables playback treatment and experiment type were marginally significant for both the behaviours enter and exit suggesting a tendency for males to repeatedly enter the acoustic nests more often than silent ones in the presence of a conspecific male (Table 1). This is supported by the observations during the trials, where we noticed fish would be more reactive when in the presence of a visual stimulus and, thus, interacted more with the nests.\nPl ayback treatment\nPI ayback tre at m e nt\nFigure 4 - Comparison of the different behaviours exhibited by the tested males towards the nest - approach, avoidance, enter and exit - according to different playback treatments (0: Silence; 1: Sound).

Dots and error bars are means and 95% confidence intervals, respectively.\nAfter the pre-stimuli, males swam to one side of the aquaria (sound vs control) at random, i.e. swimming towards the sound side was not different than expected by chance (Binomial test, P>0.05). Fish swam to the sound side 10 times out of 15 in the silence vs sound treatment and 6 out of 11 in the WN vs sound treatment. There was however a non-significant tendency for males to spend more time in the sound than in the silent side (Wilcoxon test, N=15, T=32.0, P=0.11; Figure 6a) or the WN side (Wilcoxon test, N=11, T=14.0, P=0.09; Figure 6b).\nFigure 6 - Comparison of the amount of time spent by tested males on each side of the aquarium according to playback treatment: (a) Silence vs sound and (b) WN vs sound treatment (0: Control; 1: Sound).

Error bars are minimums and maximums.\nDiscussion\nIn fish, sounds play an important role in territory acquisition and defence, as seen in multiple studies, allowing them to assess the condition of eventual competitors without the need of frontal confrontations. Besides being energetically costly, these could escalate to a series of interactions resulting in serious injuries or even death (Huntingford &amp; Turner, 1987). In this study we observed the effect of conspecific aggressive sound playback on the behaviour of subject painted goby males towards unoccupied nests. Additionally, we assessed the combined effect of sound playback with additional visual stimuli. On a first playback treatment (silence vs sound) we found that subject males would significantly approach nests associated with conspecific sounds more frequently than silent ones, and that they would interact more often with nests in the presence of an additional visual stimulus, a confined conspecific male. This pattern was also observed by Bertucci et al. (2010) where playback experiments combined with visual stimuli on a cichlid fish, Metriaclima zebra, showed that the subject specimen would stop swimming around the aquarium and focus on one of the side compartments when in the presence of a male separated by a transparent partition, actively interacting with the opponent and their own nest. In our study, though the results were marginally non-significant, subject males would also tend to enter and exit more often \u2018occupied\u2019 (acoustic) nests, implying an increase on their territorial stance. The opposite behaviour was also observed in \u2018playback only\u2019 experiments, where males would be less active suggesting that visual stimuli works as an additional motivation on territory defence complementing acoustic assessment of opponents (Bertucci et al., 2010).\nImportantly, males avoided nests associated with agonistic sounds more frequently than silent nests regardless of the presence of the visual stimulus of a nearby male. This suggests that\nagonistic sounds have a significant role in territorial defence. According to Ladich &amp; Myrberg (2006) agonistic sounds can act as a \u2018keep-out\u2019 signal towards intruders (also see Vasconcelos et al., 2010). Playback experiments have shown that agonistic sounds can increase or decrease the aggressiveness of an opponent (Schwarz, 1974; Stout, 1975; Bertucci et al., 2010) or, as mentioned above, be used to indirectly evaluate the fighting condition of an adversary (Ladich, 1998). However, as subject painted goby males also entered and exited nests associated with agonistic sounds more frequently than silent nests, even in the presence of a nearby conspecific, it seems that sounds alone are not sufficient to prevent nest intrusion, but the active action of a territorial-holder is needed.\nOn the playback treatment that used white noise as a control we registered no significant effect for playback treatment for any of the behaviours towards the nest suggesting that males may not distinguish conspecific sound from white noise. The lack of significant differences in the reaction towards nests associated with agonistic sound or white noise should be seen with caution since they could be due to the low sample size (N=6). Although we believe that agonistic sounds are key to territorial defence in the studied species and in other fishes, additional experiments are needed to examine if any sound could function in territorial defence. For example white noise following the natural pulse patterns (durations and intervals) of agonistic sounds could be used in similar experiments. The white noise stimuli used in the present study contained the temporal pattern of the painted goby agonistic sounds which we believe is needed to elicit appropriate behavioural responses in the subject males. Consistently, it has been widely proposed that most of the information of fish sounds is contained in their temporal patterning (e.g. Winn, 1964; Amorim, 2006).\nIn conclusion, we showed that agonistic sounds help but are per se insufficient to deter nest intrusions and that the additional visual stimulus of a conspecific nearby plays and important role in increasing the territorial behaviour in males. Additional experiments are required to test the significance of frequency and temporal patterns to deter territorial intrusion in fish. Also the role of sound emission rate and of sound duration should also be tested. The duration of agonistic drums and of sequences of drums have been shown to increase with painted goby male size suggesting it can provide valuable cues for male-male assessment (Amorim &amp; Neves, 2008).\nAcknowledgments\nFirst, I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr. Maria Clara Amorim and Prof. Dr. Paulo Fonseca for the opportunity to work and develop this study on such a personal and professionally enriching team and environment.
