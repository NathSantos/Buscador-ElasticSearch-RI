The incorporation of technologies has resulted in increased productivity and the more \nrational management of peach palm, with irrigation being an important tool for certain regions. Thus, \nstudies leading to proper crop management are extremely important, such as the estimate of the effective \ndepth of the root system, which is indispensable for proper irrigation management. The objective of this \nstudy was to evaluate the effects of different irrigation depths, as applied by drip irrigation, on the \ndistribution of the root system of peach palm. This experiment was conducted in Ilha Solteira, S\u00e3o Paulo \nState, Brazil, with drip irrigation, with the two systems (flow of 0.0023 m3 h-1) consisting of four irrigation \ntreatments corresponding to 0, 50, 100 and 150% of Class \u2018A\u2019 pan evaporation. After five years, an analysis \nof the Bactris gasipaes root system was performed at a distance of 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 meters from the trunk, \ncollecting sampling at two depths (0.0 to 0.3 m and 0.3 to 0.6 m) via the auger method (volumetric \nanalysis). We concluded that the effective depth of the root system used for irrigation management should \nbe a maximum of 0.3 meters. \nKeywords: Bactris gasipaes, roots, localized irrigation, irrigation management. \n\nDistribui\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema radicular da pupunheira irrigada por gotejamento \n\nRESUMO. A incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de tecnologias vem trazendo aumento de produtividade e manejo mais racional \nda pupunheira, sendo a irriga\u00e7\u00e3o uma ferramenta importante para algumas regi\u00f5es produtoras. Nesse \nsentido, estudos que levem ao manejo adequado da cultura s\u00e3o de extrema import\u00e2ncia, como a estimativa \nda profundidade efetiva do sistema radicular da cultura, indispens\u00e1vel para o correto manejo de irriga\u00e7\u00e3o.  \nO objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos de diferentes l\u00e2minas de irriga\u00e7\u00e3o, aplicadas por gotejamento, \nsobre a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema radicular da pupunheira. Este experimento foi conduzido em Ilha Solteira, \nEstado de S\u00e3o Paulo, com irriga\u00e7\u00e3o por gotejamento, com dois gotejadores autocompensantes de 0,0023 m3 h-1 \npor planta, constando de quatro tratamentos de irriga\u00e7\u00e3o que corresponderam a 0, 50, 100 e 150% da \nevapora\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua do tanque Classe \u2018A\u2019.

(2001) noted that the current \nmethods for the production of peach palm hearts are \nstill predominantly based on irrational exploitation \nand extraction, a fact that is causing the extinction of \nthe production species, particularly when \nconsidering the very long life cycle of these trees. \n\nAs indicated by Fernandes et al. (2002), peach \npalm is cultivated in different regions of Brazil, but \npredominantly in Southeast Brazil. The expansion \nof cultivated areas, including the semi-arid region, \nhas been accompanied by an advance in technology, \n\nwith the use of liming, fertilization and irrigation, \nand these techniques have enabled more rapid \nproduction. \n\nWith the use of irrigation, as shown by Marques \nand Coelho (2003), peach palm has proved to be an \nexcellent economical choice for both human \nconsumption and for use in animal feed (ALVES \nJ\u00daNIOR et al., 2004, 2005; LOPES et al., 2004; \nRODRIGUES NETO et al., 2001). \n\nEarliness is a great stimulus to the cultive peach \npalm, because the harvest initial is at around 18 \nmonths, generating a more rapid financial return. \nFurthermore, due to the uneven distribution of \n\n\n\n318 Lopes et al. \n\nActa Scientiarum. Agronomy Maring\u00e1, v. 36, n. 3, p. 317-321, July-Sept., 2014 \n\nrainfall and the very shallow root system of this \nplant with a high economic value, the practice of \nirrigation can provide a higher production yield \n(ROSA et al., 2004).  \n\nA knowledge of the quantity, quality and \ndistribution of roots is useful in agricultural \nproduction to provide information on the location \nof fertilizer application, spacing, intercrops, soil \nmanagement and irrigation (FRACARO; PEREIRA, \n2004). \n\nThe root systems of palms are generally \ncomposed of primary, secondary, tertiary and \nquaternary roots, all lacking absorbent hairs \n(JOURDAN; REY, 1997). \n\nAccording to Fante J\u00fanior et al. (1994) the \nassessment of such factors as the volume of soil \nexplored, root length and root activity is a difficult \ntask, and great difficulties are encountered in any \nsampling technique, including the time spent, \nlimited information obtained and great variability \nof results. According to Vasconcelos et al. (2003), a \nperfect method for evaluating roots does not exist \nbecause the suitability of a method for the \nevaluation of the root system depends on the in \nsitu conditions. \n\nThe objective of the present study was to \nevaluate the effects of different irrigation levels \nestimated by the Class \u2018A\u2019 pan method, as applied by \ndrip irrigation, on the distribution of the root system \nof Bactris gasipaes in Ilha Solteira, the northwest \nregion of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. \n\nMaterial and methods \n\nThis work was conducted at the Experimental \nArea of Irrigated Agriculture, Ilha Solteira, S\u00e3o \nPaulo State, Brazil, Engineering Faculty of the \nUNESP - Universidade Estadual Paulista. The \ngeographical coordinates are 20\u00ba25\u201923\u201dS and \n51\u00ba21\u201913\u201dW, and the average elevation is 335 m. \nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen classification, the climate \nis type Aw, defined as tropical humid with a rainy \nseason during the summer and a dry winter; the \naverage annual precipitation is 1,259 mm, the mean \nannual temperature is 24.7\u00b0C, and the mean annual \ninsolation is 7.4h day-1. The soil in the area is \nclassified as Acrisol; the particle size is shown in \nTable 1. \n\nTable 1. Granulometric analysis of the soil of experimental area \n(Ilha Solteira, Brazil). \n\nDeep (m) Sand (%) Clay (%) Silt (%) Classification \n0.00 \u2013 0.15 85.5 10.5 4.0 Sandy \n0.15 \u2013 0.30 84.5 11.0 4.5 Sandy \n0.30 \u2013 0.45 82.0 14.5 3.5 Sandy \n0.45 \u2013 0.60 80.5 17.5 2.0 Sandy \n\nPeach palm seedlings were planted in 1993 at a \nspacing of 2.0 x 1.0 m, and irrigation was performed \nby two drip irrigation systems with a flow of 0.0023 \nm3 h-1. The irrigated treatments received fertigation \nfour times a year, according to the soil analysis and \nrecommendations of Bovi and Cantarella (1996). \n\nThe experimental design was completely \nrandomized in a 4 x 3 x 2 factorial scheme of four \nirrigation treatments at three distances from the \nstem and two depths, with four replications. The \ntreatments were implemented based on the \nreplacement of Class \u2018A\u2019 pan evaporation (CAE) \ncorresponding to no irrigation (NI), 50% CAE, \n100% CAE and 150% CAE. \n\nAn analysis of the root system of peach palm was \nperformed in November 1999 when the adult plants \nwere five years old and considered to have a stable root \nsystem. The sampling occurred at 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 m \nfrom the trunk, between the planting lines, and at two \ndepths, 0.0 to 0.3 m and 0.3 to 0.6 m. For this purpose, \nan auger was used, and both the soil and roots were \ncollected in a receptacle of known volume (4.03 dm3); \nthe material (root + soil)was washed in the laboratory \nand dried in an oven at 65\u00b0C for 48h. \n\nThe results were expressed in grams of roots per \ncubic decimeter of soil (g dm-3); the data were \nsubjected to an analysis of variance, and the means \nwere compared suing the Tukey test at a 5% \nprobability. The selection of the equation of best fit \nwas based on the significance of the regression \neffect, the deviations of the regression tested by the \nF-test at 5% and the highest coefficient of \ndetermination (R2). \n\nResults and discussion \n\nThe drip irrigation system used resulted in an \nelevated soil moisture in the monitored area, which \nwas between the planted rows. An understanding of \nthe wet bulb area, the movement of water in the soil \nvia percolation and the extraction by the plants as \nfunctions of the treatment is necessary for studying a \nroot system under drip irrigation. \n\nTable 2 shows that there was an increase in the \namount of dry root biomass as the irrigation depth \nincreased, results that are consistent with those of \nReichardt (1993), reporting that the root system of a \nplant is proportional to the soil moisture. Reichardt \nand Tim (2004) also reported that the amount of \nwater absorbed by plants is a function of both the \nwater potential in the soil and also the ability of the \nroots to absorb water from the soil with which they \nare in contact, in addition to soil properties for the \nprovision and transmission of water to the roots at a \nrate that meets the requirements of transpiration.  \n\n\n\nRoot distribution of peach palm 319 \n\nActa Scientiarum.

In all of the \ntreatments studied (except NI), over 90% of the \nroots were found at depths from 0 to 0.3 m, which \nindicates that 0.3 m is the effective depth of the root \nsystem for the purpose of irrigation management. \nThis value was higher than that found by Ramos  \net al. (2009), who reported that 65% of the root \nsystem of this palm is concentrated in the top 0.2 m \nof soil, noting that this depth can be considered for \nthe proper management of water and fertilizer \napplications. However, in the present study, there \nwas a decrease in the root content when approaching \nthe middle of the row (Figure 1). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.

(2005) found \nthat the root system in one year-old trees was \nconcentrated mostly in the topsoil (0.0-0.2 m deep) \nand at distances up to 0.5 m from the plant, as also \nindicated in the present study. This palm species \nexhibited a high concentration of roots near the \nstem and at shallow depths (Figure 2). \n\nUnder the conditions of the study area, irrigation \nmanagement should prevail, with the adoption of a \nmore frequent irrigation frequency such that there is \nno percolation of water in the soil profile and, \ntherefore, no accumulation of water below the \neffective depth of the root system. \n\nWith the irrigation managements NI, 50% CAE, \n100% CAE and 150% CAE, the proportions of the \ntotal dry root mass in the 0.0 to 0.3 m layer were \n78.3, 90.4, 93.3 and 92.8%, respectively. When \nevaluating peach palm in sandy and clayey texture \nsoils in the S\u00e3o Francisco valley in the semi-arid \nregion of northeastern Brazil, Bassoi et al. (1999) \nobserved that the root system of peach palm grown \nat a spacing of 2.0 x 1.0 m and with irrigation \nperformed by farrows presented shallow rooting and \nthat approximately 90% of the roots were \nconcentrated in the top 0.4 m of the soil. \n\nFigure 2 shows the linear regression equations of \ndecreasing root dry mass for each irrigation \nmanagement as a function of the distance from the \n\n\n\n320 Lopes et al. \n\nActa Scientiarum.

It can be noted that the dry mass between the \ntreatments of 50% CAE and 100% CAE showed a \nnegligible variation at 0 m from the trunk. In \ncontrast, at one meter away from the trunk of peach \npalm, all of the irrigation management treatments \nshowed similar root dry weights, such that this was \nmost likely not influenced by the irrigation. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2. Root dry mass as a function of the distance from the \ntrunk of peach palm in relation to the irrigation treatment. No \nirrigation (NI), 50% of the evaporation of the Class A pan (50% \nCAE), 100% of the evaporation of the Class A pan (100% CAE) \nand 150% of the evaporation of the Class A pan 150% CAE) (Ilha \nSolteira, Brazil). \n\nFerreira et al. (1995) observed by regression \nanalysis that the mass of the root system of peach \npalm decreases dramatically at a distance exceeding \n0.50 m from the trunk. Bassoi et al. (2003) observed \nthat a depth maximum rooting of 0.40 m at 6 \nmonths and 1.0 m at 12 and 24 months after \nplanting. Furthermore, between rows, these authors \nreported that the roots reached a distance of 0.6 m \nfrom the trunk at 6 months after planting but the \npresence of the root system was observed at a \ndistance of 1.0 m from the stem after 12 months, \nindicating entanglement among the roots of \nneighboring plants. This was also observed in all of \nthe treatments of the present study. However the \nstrategy of irrigation management should be to \nprovide a water supply to the surface layer (up to  \n0.3 m); in the case of drip irrigation, this should be \nperformed close to the trunk, not exceeding 0.5 m. \nFor a better efficiency of water use, irrigation should \nbe performed frequently, preferably daily for drip \nirrigation in Acrisol and at least every 5 days for \nsprinkler irrigation. \n\nIt can be observed in Table 3 that the root dry \nmass was influenced by the interaction between the \nirrigation treatment and the depth of 0.0 to 0.3 m. \nThe NI treatment showed the lowest value, \ndiffering from the other irrigation treatments and \nshowing a difference of 1.14, 1.63 and 2.56 g dm-3 in \nrelation to treatments 50% CAE, 100% CAE and \n150% CAE, respectively. It may be noted that, at a \n5% probability, the irrigation treatments did not \ninfluence the root dry mass for the depth of 0.3 to \n0.6 m. \n\nConclusion \n\nIt is recommended that the effective depth of the \nroot system used for irrigation management in peach \npalm, which is at maximum 0.3 meters. \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nTo FAPESP for the scholarship and financial \nsupport, allowing that this study be carried out. \n\nReferences \n\nALVES J\u00daNIOR, J.; HERNANDEZ, F.
