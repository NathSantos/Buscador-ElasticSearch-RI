Commonly, these scaffolds are produced through\n3D printing which is currently unable to meet the growing demand for artificial tissues. A novel approach\nis to construct a system of colloidal particles that spontaneously aggregate with cells mediating the bonds.\nWith this technique, we avoid the need of an invasive surgery as the scaffold is constructed already inside\nthe body.\nThrough a set of mean-field rate equations and percolation theory, we show that suppressing the natural\nadhesion between cells results in larger scaffolds that self-assemble faster. Simulations of two lattice\nmodels using the kinetic Monte Carlo technique reveal how practitioners can tune the ratio of cells to\nparticles and the ratio of diffusion coefficients to obtain desired scaffold characteristics such as size,\ninterconnectivity, and assembly time. In particular, an optimal value of the ratio of cells to particles was\nfound such that a larger, more interconnected scaffold assembles faster.\nWe show also that aggregate diffusivity is crucial for the dynamics, having studied the limits in which\nsize does not effect diffusivity and in which diffusion of aggregates occurs on a much slower timescale\nthan the diffusion of particles and cells. For the former, an interval of the ratio of cells to particles\nwas found such that a giant aggregate that includes all particles forms, in agreement with some simple\ncalculations. For the latter, it was found that the average size of aggregates exhibits a bimodal shape\nas a function of the ratio of cells to particles with two optimal values in the asymptotic limit. The\nproposed mechanism involving the suppression of bonds between a portion of the particles is verified\nwith an analytical treatment and simulations. We show that the ratio of diffusion coefficients of cells and\nparticles can suppress these two optimal values through two distinct mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: linker-mediated aggregation, cell dynamics, patchy colloids, self-assembly, scaffolds.\n\niii\n\n\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nTe?cnicas para a formac?a?o de tecido artificial muitas vezes fazem uso de uma estrutura so?lida (conhecida\ncomo armac?a?o) que funciona como um substituto tempora?rio para a matriz extracelular, e facilita o\ncrescimento esponta?neo de tecido. Va?rias restric?o?es sa?o impostas sobre as armac?o?es, entre elas biocom-\npatibilidade, biodegradabilidade e porosidade e resiste?ncia meca?nica adequadas.\nCommumente, estas armac?o?es sa?o produzidas usando impressoras 3D, uma te?cnica que e? incapaz de sat-\nisfazer a procura crescente de tecidos artificiais. A necessidade de impressa?o da armac?a?o fora do corpo\ntem associada problemas te?cnicos referentes a? biocompatibilidade, assim como problemas econo?micos\ndevido a? necessidade de uma cirurgia. Uma te?cnica recentemente proposta consiste numa soluc?a?o in-\njeta?vel de part??culas coloidais que se auto-organizam para formar a armac?a?o desejada in situ, na?o sendo\nnecessa?ria uma intervenc?a?o me?dica invasiva. A superf??cie das part??culas coloidais e? biofuncionalizada\ncom anticorpos que interagem selectivamente com as ce?lulas que formam o tecido desejado. Ce?lulas\nservem enta?o de mediador das ligac?o?es entre part??culas, que se agregam para formar a armac?a?o. As\nce?lulas mediadoras depois proliferam e formam o tecido usando a armac?a?o como a?ncora.\nComo as ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas e part??culas sa?o efectivamente irrevers??veis, o balanc?o detalhado na?o e?\nalcanc?ado e o formalismo da f??sica estat??stica de equil??brio e? incapaz de descrever adequadamente o\nproblema. Novos modelos e te?cnicas foram desenvolvidos de maneira a capturar a f??sica, que e? sens??vel\na? dina?mica tanto individual como coletiva. Neste trabalho, aumentou-se a complexidade dos modelos\ngradualmente, permitindo o estudo detalhado do efeito de cada contribuic?a?o atrave?s de um modelo de\npart??culas com vale?ncia limitada (patchy).\nNuma primeira abordagem escreveu-se um sistema de equac?o?es de balanc?o para estudar a dina?mica das\nce?lulas na presenc?a e ause?ncia da adesa?o natural entre ce?lulas. Definiu-se uma probabilidade de ligac?a?o\nentre patches e uma distribuic?a?o do nu?mero de ligac?o?es, ambas estudadas analiticamente e numerica-\nmente. No caso da ause?ncia de ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas, foi poss??vel resolver as equac?o?es analiticamente\npara um intervalo de para?metros e uma aproximac?a?o foi desenvolvida que recupera as soluc?o?es para outro\nintervalo. No caso da presenc?a de ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas, estudou-se tambe?m a dina?mica de agregados de\nce?lulas.\nEm ambos os casos, foi descoberto que o nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula e? crucial para a dina?mica,\nlimitando o nu?mero de ligac?o?es atrave?s do defeito ou excesso de ce?lulas. Encontrou-se um valor o?timo\npara o nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula que maximiza a probabilidade de ligac?a?o quando as ligac?o?es entre\nce?lulas esta?o ausentes. Como e? preciso um patch com ce?lula e outro sem ce?lula, este valor o?timo e? tal\nque o nu?mero de ce?lulas e? metade do nu?mero de patches. Encontrou-se tambe?m que a raza?o entre os\ncoeficientes de difusa?o de ce?lulas e part??culas controla a competic?a?o entre ce?lulas com uma ou nenhuma\nligac?a?o pelos patches livres, servindo como para?metro de controlo para a probabilidade assinto?tica de\nligac?a?o. O coeficiente de difusa?o das part??culas e? func?a?o do seu tamanho e pode enta?o ser ajustado para\nobter a armac?a?o desejada.\nComparando os dois modelos, descobriu-se que o modelo sem ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas resulta em armac?o?es\n\nv\n\n\n\nmaiores e mais interligadas que se auto-organizam em menos tempo. Este resultado na?o so? tem interesse\ndo ponto do vista teo?rico como permite experimentalmente produzir armac?o?es mais eficazes e menos\nprova?veis de sofrer influe?ncias indesejadas pela bioatividade do meio envolvente. Finalmente, aplicou-\nse percolac?a?o de campo me?dio para obter o intervalo de para?metros no qual a armac?a?o forma um gel.\nEstudaram-se os efeitos das correlac?o?es espaciais entre agregados atrave?s de um modelo de rede que foi\nresolvido numericamente, usando-se uma variante de kinetic Monte Carlo com rejeic?o?es. Esta te?cnica\nbaseia-se na listagem de eventos poss??veis (difusa?o para vizinhos) e seleciona a part??cula/ce?lula que\ndifunde com uma probabilidade proporcional a? taxa de difusa?o de part??culas/ce?lulas (fixada no in??cio da\nsimulac?a?o e proporcional ao coeficiente de difusa?o).\nNo modelo de rede, os agregados sa?o a?rvores e pontuais; o tamanho dos agregados e? contabilizado\natrave?s de duas probabilidades de ligac?a?o. Estudou-se em detalhe o efeito da difusividade dos agrega-\ndos. O limite onde o tamanho de um agregado na?o tem efeito sobre a sua difusividade mostra forte\ndepende?ncia no nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula. Tre?s regimes foram identificados tendo em conta o seu\nestado assinto?tico; num deles, todas as part??culas formam um u?nico agregado. Este resultado e? impor-\ntante para os experimentalistas pois e? necessa?rio uma armac?a?o macrosco?pica para se formar um tecido\nsauda?vel. Um ca?lculo simples recupera esta partic?a?o do espac?o de para?metros usando apenas a condic?a?o\nde agregados serem a?rvores. Nos outros dois regimes, encontrou-se a forma funcional da distribuic?a?o\nde tamanhos dos agregados, mostrando que ela tem uma cauda exponencial e portanto um tamanho\nme?dio bem-definido. Estudou-se tambe?m o efeito da raza?o entre os coeficientes de difusa?o de ce?lulas e\npart??culas, onde se verificou que controla o estado assinto?tico para um dos regimes apenas.\nO limite onde a difusa?o de agregados ocorre numa escala de tempo muito mais lenta que a de part??culas\ne ce?lulas mostra fenomenologia distinta. No limite onde ce?lulas difundem muito mais rapidamente que\npart??culas, o estado assinto?tico mostra um tamanho me?dio de agregados com forma bimodal, com dois\nvalores o?timos do nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula na?o-triviais, precedido por um estado transiente com\napenas um valor o?timo (correspondente ao descoberto anteriormente). Estes valores o?timos correspon-\ndem a?s fronteiras do intervalo do nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula em que na?o ha? part??culas livres no\nestado assinto?tico. Definiu-se a distribuic?a?o de patches com ce?lula dos mono?meros e comprovou-se que\nera uma binomial. Como e? necessa?rio um patch com ce?lula e um sem ce?lula para se formar uma ligac?a?o,\npart??culas sem patches com ce?lulas na?o pode formar ligac?o?es com outras part??culas com nenhum patch\ncom ce?lula. O mesmo com part??culas com nenhum patch sem ce?lula. A impossibilidade destas ligac?o?es\nleva aos ma?ximos encontrados. Um modelo simples de campo me?dio reproduz a posic?a?o e altura dos\nma?ximos sem qualquer para?metro de ajuste.\nUm segundo modelo de rede foi proposto e implementado com a te?cnica kinetic Monte Carlo. Neste\nmodelo, cada part??cula ocupa um lugar de rede, permitindo o estudo do efeito da forma dos agregados.\nApenas se estudou o limite dos agregados muito mais lentos que part??culas. Encontrou-se a mesma forma\nbimodal (com um ligeiro desvio em relac?a?o ao modelo descrito anteriormente), o que permitiu concluir\nque a forma na?o e? relevante para o mecanismo proposto.\nTomando o limite inverso onde mono?meros difundem muito mais ra?pido que ce?lulas, descobriu-se que os\nma?ximos desaparecem. Devido a corresponderem a mecanismos diferentes, os ma?ximos desaparecem a\nvalores diferentes de escalas de tempo de difusa?o. Um dos mecanismos surge quando as ce?lulas difundem\nmais rapidamente que as part??culas e consiste numa reduc?a?o efetiva do nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula,\naumentando o nu?mero de d??meros. Este mecanismo so? faz desaparecer um dos ma?ximos. O segundo\nma?ximo desaparece apenas quando as part??culas difundem muito mais rapidamente que as ce?lulas, limite\nem que d??meros e ce?lulas sa?o efectivamente esta?ticos quando comparados com as part??culas. Devido a?\ndificuldade de formac?a?o de ligac?o?es entre ce?lulas e d??meros, o tamanho me?dio dos agregados diminui.\n\nvi\n\n\n\nAmbos os mecanismos resultam enta?o no aumento do nu?mero de d??meros no estado assinto?tico.\nEstudou-se a interconectividade dos agregados atrave?s da proporc?a?o de ligac?o?es que sa?o loops, desco-\nbrindo um valor o?timo do nu?mero de ce?lulas por part??cula. Este valor o?timo corresponde ao valor o?timo\nque maximiza o tamanho me?dio dos agregados no estado transiente, e e? explicado usando a distribuic?a?o\nde patches com ce?lula. Um estudo dos efeitos de tamanho finito e? realizado.\nConclu??mos com um estudo do efeito da densidade de ce?lulas e part??culas. Os modelos de rede sa?o\nva?lidos apenas no limite de densidade baixas onde encontra?mos uma relac?a?o linear entre a densidade e\naltura dos ma?ximos do tamanho me?dio dos agregados.\n\nPalavras-chave: agregac?a?o mediada por linkers, dina?mica celular, colo?ides patchy, auto-organizac?a?o,\narmac?o?es\n\nvii\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nList of Figures xi\n\n1 Introduction 1\n\n2 Mean-field balance equations 5\n2.1 Without cell-cell adhesion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n2.2 With cell-cell adhesion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n2.3 Comparison between the two mechanisms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n2.4 Percolation properties (mean-field) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n\n3 Lattice model 21\n3.1 Computational methods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n3.2 Constant aggregate diffusion coefficient . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3 Diffusion of only free monomers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\n\n4 The role of the shape of aggregates 35\n4.1 Computational methods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n4.2 Diffusion of only free monomers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n\nConclusion 45\n\nBibliography 47\n\nix\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Figures\n\n1.1 Diagram representing the preparation of self-assembling scaffolds. . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n1.2 Experimental image of a self-assembled structure. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\n\n2.1 Illustration of the possible reactions when cell-cell bonds are suppressed. . . . . . . . . 6\n2.2 Solutions of eqs.

A scaffold is a micrometric solid\nstructure to which healthy cells can adhere. As time passes, the cells that form bonds to the scaffold\nproliferate, increasing the cell population. The role of the scaffold is of an anchor, accelerating the\nprocess of tissue growth as well as defining its overall shape [3].\nAs the scaffold is meant as a temporary replacement for the naturally occurring extracellular matrix, it\nmust follow several restrictions: a key characteristic in avoiding rejection is biocompatibility; cells must\nbe able to adhere to it and function as under natural conditions; it must be biodegradable, as scaffolds\nare intended as temporary structures that form autonomous tissues and are eventually disassembled by\nthe body; it must be rigid enough so as to withstand mechanical perturbations; finally it must be porous\nenough for both cells and nutrients to be able to penetrate the scaffold. Healthy tissue requires cell\nadhesion on the outskirts of the scaffold as well as inside its pores [2\u20138].\nTo grow a structure that copes with these requirements at the micrometer scale, one usually makes use\nof a 3D printer to create a cage-like structure which is then transplanted into the patient. There are many\ndrawbacks regarding this method. 3D-printing such small objects is very expensive and currently not\nsuitable for large-scale industrial production, as different types of scaffolds require entirely different pro-\nduction processes and equipment. Also, a scaffold produced this way must be printed in a laboratory and\nonly afterwards be inserted into the patient [9]. This brings about many new challenges concerning the\nbiocompatibility and structural integrity of the scaffold. The need for a surgery imposes an economical\nbottleneck for the widespread use of scaffolds as it is not sufficient to create scaffold production lines.\nSkilled labor and equipment in the form of a surgeon and a hospital are also required [2, 4, 10].\nAn alternative fabrication technique that would reduce the requirements has been proposed by the group\nof J. F. Mano, at the University of Aveiro. The idea is to functionalize the surface of chitosan particles\nwith antibodies, selected so as to form bonds only to the cells that will make up the tissue and not to each\nother [1]. This procedure ensures direct bonds between particles cannot occur, instead requiring a cell\nas mediator. These particles are injected directly into the afflicted area, where they diffuse alongside the\ncells, recruiting them and forming indirect particle-particle bonds. The resulting self-assembled structure\nwill serve as a scaffold and, having formed itself inside the body, no preparation related to transportation\nis needed. There is no need to manually craft the scaffold in a printer as the system spontaneously\nself-organizes into the desired structure. The cells mediating the bonds also proliferate, serving the dual\npurpose of building the tissue as well as the scaffold. Typically cell division only occurs after the scaffold\nis formed [1, 11].\nAs the typical cell-particle bond energies are much higher than the thermal energy found inside the hu-\n\n1\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Diagram representing the preparation of self-assembling scaffolds. Chitosan microparticles are functionalized with\nantibodies which selectively interact with the target cells. The injectable solution forms a scaffold in situ [1].\n\nman body [12], the characteristic time needed for a bond to break is much greater than the relevant\nexperimental timescale. As the formation of bonds is effectively irreversible, detailed balance is broken\nand standard equilibrium statistical physics concepts and methods fail to provide an adequate descrip-\ntion of the problem. As the system does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium, both the collective and\nindividual dynamics are crucial for an understanding of the problem, requiring novel techniques to be\ndeveloped, and making our work stand out from previous studies on aggregation with linkers [13]. Be-\ncause correlations in time are important, there will be high sensitivity to variables such as concentration\nand diffusion coefficient of particles and cells; different models with differing degrees of complexity\nwill be presented with the goal of characterizing the influence of each added feature. Our work can\nguide experiments and help to find new phenomena as theoretical studies can explore more efficiently\nthe configuration space and isolate the effect of each separate feature of the problem.\n\nThere are many features of the experimental motivation that are physically relevant and must be included\nin our theoretical description. Both cells and particles are suspended in a fluid and diffuse due to micro-\nscopic collisions with the fluid molecules. Both particles and free cells can be approximated as spherical.\nAs seen in Fig. 1.2, cells (radius ? 10\u00b5m) are much smaller than particles (radius ? 100\u00b5m), so their\ndiffusion coefficient is much larger. The surface of the particles is engineered with functional groups\nwhich selectively interact with cells when they coming upon a certain distance of each other. This al-\nlows cells to mediate particle-particle bonds, which are taken to be irreversible. Due to the small size\nof cells when compared to the size of particles, and due to cells flattening upon adhesion [14], the case\nwhere a cell adheres to more than two particles is very unlikely, allowing us to model cells as colloidal\n\n2\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Experimental image of a self-assembled structure produced with the methodology described in Fig. (1.1).

The maximum coordination number a 3D compact structure of equal spheres\nmay have is twelve [15], as seen in a cubic close-packed or an hexagonal close-packed configuration of\nhard spheres. The case studied in this work does not include an exterior driving force that compresses\nthe particles together. As such, we consider particles to have only six patches, one for each direction\nin 3D space. The cells adhere to the antibodies which cover the surface of the particles. There are\nmany antibodies in the surface, but only six orientations are taken to be relevant for cell-mediated bonds,\nconsequently many cells mediate the bond between two particles. A rescaling of the cell number den-\nsity, corresponding to bonds that are exclusively between one particle patch and one cell patch, greatly\nsimplifies the model.\nCells tend to adhere to each other, a behavior that can be suppressed chemically. This suppression will\nnot hinder tissue growth as it is not genetically encoded in the cells, and will not be inherited upon cell\ndivision. As scaffold assembly is typically much faster than cell division, only chemically treated cells\ntake part in the process. Cell dynamics, including the effect of suppressing cell-cell bonds is studied in\nchapter 2 through mean-field rate equations. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce lattice models which reveal the\nrole of correlations between aggregates and patches, respectively. Finally, some conclusions are drawn\nin chapter 4.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nMean-field balance equations\n\nLet us consider a system of colloidal particles and cells. The particles are spherical and their surface is\nfunctionalized with six patches. Due to the interaction of the particles with the surrounding fluid, they\nexhibit rotational and translational Brownian motion with diffusion coefficients Dr and Dp, respectively.\nAs particles are much larger than the fluid molecules, there is a separation of timescales between the\ndiffusion of fluid molecules and the one of particles, and thus the interaction with the fluid is considered\nuncorrelated in space and time within the timescale we are interested in. We neglect hydrodynamic\ninteractions between particles mediated by the solvent and caused by motion-induced flow fields, which\nare weak at large distances between particles [16]. We instead describe the pairwise interaction between\nparticles with an isotropic, short-range, repulsive potential.\n\nCells are considered isotropic and spherical, exhibiting the same translational Brownian motion as parti-\ncles, but with a different diffusion coefficient. Two models will be studied for cell-cell interactions, both\nof which neglect hydrodynamic interactions. In the model studied in section 2.1, there is an isotropic\nshort-range repulsion between the cells and thus cell-cell adhesion is neglected; in the model studied in\nsection 2.2, there is an isotropic short-range attraction which mimics cell-cell adhesion.\n\nCells and particle patches interact with an isotropic, short-range, attractive potential, the depth of which\nis much lower than the thermal energy. Particles and cells form irreversible bonds as the characteristic\ntime for bond breaking is much longer than the relevant timescale. The mechanism for aggregation is\nthe formation of particle-particle bonds mediated by one or more cells, as direct bonds between particles\ncannot occur. A cell (or cell aggregate) can form a bond with two patches at most, each belonging to a\ndifferent particle.\n\nIn the experimental motivation, the antibodies to which cells form bonds are much smaller than cells\nand are well spread-out across the surface of particles, and so cells can cover the entire surface of the\nparticle. The maximum number of cells that can form a bond to a particle is given by ?p/?c, where ?p\nis the average surface area of a particle and ?c is the average covering area of a cell after it adheres to a\nparticle. The covering area ?c is different than the surface area of a free cell, as cells spread on substrates\nupon adhesion in a highly complex way [14]. The condition of the patchy colloid model stating that\npatches can form bonds to only one cell is a useful simplification, as it is not necessary to consider the\nmediation of more than one cell since bonds are irreversible, and consequently a portion of the cells do\nnot play a role in the dynamics. The mapping from the experimental motivation to the patchy colloid\nmodel thus implies an effective number density of cells. In the patchy colloid model, the maximum\nnumber of cells that can form a bond to a particle is f. The rescaling of the number density of cells is\n\n5\n\n\n\nthus given by\n\nCmodel = f\n\n(\n?p\n?c\n\n)?1\nCreal, (2.1)\n\nwhere Cmodel and Creal are the rescaled and the real number densities respectively. Henceforth, all\nreferences to densities correspond to the rescaled number densities instead of the real number densities\nin the experiments.\nIn this chapter, we start by studying the dynamics of the cells. We assume that the diffusion promotes\na homogeneous distribution of cells and patches, such that density fluctuations in space are short-lived\ncompared to the average time between cell-particle interactions, and that the distribution of patches\nis uncorrelated in space and time. Therefore, in the timescale relevant to the dynamics, densities are\nassumed to be constant in space (mean field). After a study of the dynamics of cells, we combine the\nresults with mean-field percolation to study the aggregation of particles.\n\n2.1 Without cell-cell adhesion\n\nFigure 2.1: Illustration of the possible reactions when cell-cell bonds are suppressed: a) bond between a free cell and a free\npatch, resulting in an occupied patch; b) bond between an occupied patch and a free patch, resulting in a particle-particle bond.\n\nWe first look to the dynamics of cells when cell-cell bonds are suppressed. The only bonds that are\npossible are cell-particle bonds. We define ?(t) as the density of patches that do not form a bond to cells\n(free patches), C0(t) the density of cells that do not form a bond to patches (free cells), C1(t) the density\nof cells forming bonds with only one patch (occupied patches), and C2(t) the density of cells forming\nbonds with two patches (particle-particle bonds). We write down a set of balance equations to describe\nthe dynamics, ???????\n\n??????\nC?0 = ?k0C0?,\nC?1 = k0C0??k1C1?,\nC?2 = k1C1?,\n\n?? = ?k0C0??k1C1?.\n\n(2.2a)\n\n(2.2b)\n\n(2.2c)\n\n(2.2d)\n\nC0 (described by equation (2.2a)) always decreases as free cells form bonds with free patches and no\nbond is broken (see Fig. 2.1 a)). C1 (described by eq. (2.2b)) increases with the formation of free\ncell-patch bonds and decreases with the formation of bonds between occupied patches and free patches\n(see Fig. 2.1 b)). C2 (described by eq. (2.2c)) always increases as occupied patches form bonds with\nfree patches and no bond may be broken. The cells act as linkers between particles, mediating particle-\nparticle bonds. ? (described by eq. (2.2d)) always decreases as free cells and occupied patches form\nbonds with free patches and no bond is broken. We have introduced two constants: k0, which is the rate\n\n6\n\n\n\nat which free cells form bonds with free patches; and k1, which is the rate at which occupied patches\nform bonds to free patches. These constants are determined by the diffusion coefficient of particles and\ncells. As we neglect correlations, even those in the same particle, we use the 3D coalescence reaction\nrate K between two species of diffusing, spherical, and isotropic particles [17, 18] in order to relate the\nreaction rates k0 and k1 with the diffusion coefficients and radii of cells and particles,\n\nK = 4?(D1 + D2)(R1 + R2), (2.3)\n\nwhere D1, D2, R1 and R2 are the diffusion coefficients and radii of the two species respectively. Since a\npatch can form a bond with only one cell, we assume the radius of the patches is of the same order as the\nradius of the cells. The diffusion coefficients of spherical isotropic particles Di depend on their radius\nRi, as predicted by the Stokes-Einstein relation [19]\n\nDi =\nkBT\n\n8?? Ri\n, (2.4)\n\nwhere ? is the viscosity of the suspending medium and T is the thermostat temperature. Since cells\nare one order of magnitude smaller than the particles, we may approximate the diffusion coefficient of\noccupied patches by the diffusion coefficient of particles. Using eqs. (2.3) and (2.4):\n\nk0 = 4?(Dc + Dp)(Rc + Rc) =\nkBT\n\n?\n\n(\n1 +\n\nRc\nRp\n\n)\n,\n\nk1 = 4?(Dp + Dp)(Rc + Rc) = 2\nkBT\n\n?\n\nRc\nRp\n\n,\n\n(2.5a)\n\n(2.5b)\n\nwith Dc and Rc referring to cells and Dp and Rp referring to particles. We introduce k\n\nk =\nk1\nk0\n, (2.6)\n\nwhich is the relative rate at which occupied patches and free patches form bonds in comparison to free\ncells and free patches. From eqs. (2.5a) and (2.5b)\n\nk =\n2\n\n1 +\nRp\nRc\n\n. (2.7)\n\nNote that k ?]0, 2[. If k &lt;1, particles are larger than cells; if k > 1, cells are larger than particles. In\nthe experiments Rp ? 10Rc (k ? 0.1), and so we are interested in the case k &lt;1. We rescale time\n(t ? k0t) and choose units of volume such that the system occupies unitary volume, obtaining:???????\n\n??????\nC?0 = ?C0?,\nC?1 = C0??kC1?,\nC?2 = kC1?,\n\n?? = ?C0??kC1?.\n\n(2.8a)\n\n(2.8b)\n\n(2.8c)\n\n(2.8d)\n\nThe rate constant k0 therefore sets the timescale and k determines the dynamics. k is a major control\nparameter as it sets the competition for free patches between free cells and occupied patches. Increasing\nk increases the rate of formation of occupied patch/free patch bonds in relation to free cell/free patch\n\n7\n\n\n\nbonds.\n\nAs initial conditions, we assume that all cells and particles are free and uniformly distributed. We define\nn as the density of particles and f as the number of patches per particle, thus\n\n?(0) = nf. (2.9)\n\nAs discussed previously, we take f = 6 hereafter. We also introduce ?, which is defined as the ratio\nbetween free cells and free patches in the initial state,\n\n? =\nC0(0)\n\n?(0)\n, (2.10)\n\nand,\n\nC0(0) = C, (2.11)\n\nC1(0) = 0, (2.12)\n\nC2(0) = 0, (2.13)\n\n?(0) =\nC\n\n?\n. (2.14)\n\nFigure 2.2 shows the numerical solution of eqs. (2.8a)\u2013(2.8d). If ? &lt;0.5, there are enough patches for\nall cells to form two bonds (C2(?) = C), as seen in Fig. 2.2 a). Since k ? 1, there is a separation of\ntimescales: the time needed for cells to form one bond is much smaller than the time needed for them to\nform a second bond, leading to the prolonged tail in C1. If ? > 0.5, the dynamics cease when all free\npatches form a bond (?(?) = 0), as in Fig. 2.2 b). In this case, C0(?), C1(?), and C2(?) depend\non k. If k ? 1, free cells are much faster than occupied patches, exhausting all patches before occupied\npatches can become particle-particle bonds\n\n(\nC1(?) > C0(?)\n\n)\n. If k = 1, as in Fig. 2.2 c), the two rates\n\nare the same and the two reactions compete. Eventually, the total rate of free cells turning into occupied\npatches equals the one of occupied patches turning into particle-particle bonds and C?1(t) = 0.\n\nCombining eqs. (2.8a)\u2013(2.8c), we get a conservation equation for cells:\n\nC?0 + C?1 + C?2 = 0 ? C0 + C1 + C2 = C, (2.15)\n\nwhere C is the total density of cells, which is constant. Combining eqs. (2.8a), (2.8b), and (2.8d), we get\na conservation equation for patches:\n\n?? = C?1 + 2C?0 ? ??C1 ? 2C0 = ?0, (2.16)\n\nwith ?0 being a constant. If C &lt;?(0), the dynamics ceases when all cells have two bonds, C0 = C1 = 0\nand ? = ?0. ?0 is the density of free patches after all cells form two bonds. If ?0 &lt;0, there are not\nenough patches for all cells to form two bonds and dynamics saturate due to a lack of patches rather than\na lack of cells. From eqs. (2.12)\u2013(2.14) and (2.16), we obtain\n\n?0 =\n1 ? 2?\n?\n\nC. (2.17)\n\nWe can combine eqs.

The first solvable approximation that could be tried is to ignore the k in the exponent\nas it is smaller than one.\n\nC?0 = ?\n[\n(A1 + ?0)C0 +\n\n2k ? 1\nk ? 1\n\nC20\n\n]\n. (2.24)\n\nDefining ?1 = A1 + ?0 and ?2 =\n2k?1\nk?1 we get:\n\nC0 =\n?1 exp(?1 A2)\n\nexp(?1 t) ??2 exp(?1 A2)\n, (2.25)\n\nwhere A2 is a constant. If C0(0) = C then\n\nA2 =\n1\n\n?1\nlog\n\n(\nC\n\nC?2 + ?1\n\n)\n. (2.26)\n\nIt can be shown that performing a Taylor expansion on the term with exponent 1 + k of eq. (2.23) does\nnot significantly improve the approximation and only introduces corrections to ?1 and ?2. To obtain the\nlimits in which eq (2.25) is a valid approximation, we rearrange eq. (2.23) as\n\nC?0 = ?\n(\n\n(A1C\nk\n0 + ?0)C0 +\n\n2k ? 1\nk ? 1\n\nC20\n\n)\n. (2.27)\n\nExpanding the exponential (keeping up to the first order term) we get\n\nC?0 = ?\n{[\nA1\n[\n1 + k log(C0)\n\n]\n+ ?0\n\n]\nC0 +\n\n2k ? 1\nk ? 1\n\nC20\n\n}\n.

Condition (2.29) (and thus the approximation) is valid for\nsmall values of ? and k (see Fig. 2.3).\n\nThe case k = 1\n2\n\nin eq. (2.23) is analytically solvable. Note that A1 = 2C1/2. Equation (2.23) reduces to\n\nC?0 = ?\n(\nA1C\n\n3\n2\n0 + ?0C0\n\n)\n, (2.30)\n\nwhich has the solution,\n\nC0(t) =\n\n??????\n?????\n\n?20[\nA1 + A3 exp(\n\n?0t\n2\n\n)\n]2 if ?0 6= 0,\n\n4\n\n(A1t + A3)\n2\n\nif ?0 = 0.\n\n(2.31)\n\n(2.32)\n\nIntroducing the initial conditions (and using the fact that C0(t) is strictly decreasing):\n\nA3 =\n\n{\n??0C?1/2 ?A1 if ?0 6= 0,\n2C?1/2 if ?0 = 0.\n\nFor the condition ? > 1\n2\n, the dynamics cease when ? = 0. Therefore we can obtain from eq. (2.21)\n\nC0(?)\nC\n\n=\n\n(\n1 ? 2?\n\n2?\n\n)2\n, (2.33)\n\nand from eq. (2.22)\nC2(?)\nC\n\n= 1 +\n1 ? 2?\n?\n\n+\n\n(\n1 ? 2?\n\n2?\n\n)2\n. (2.34)\n\nTo characterize the self-assembled structure, we look to the bond probability pb, defined as the proba-\nbility that a patch forms a cell-mediated bond to another patch. This probability is a measure of how\nwell-connected the structure is, as it determines the average number of cell-mediated bonds per particle.\nIn section 2.4, the influence of pb on the structure is discussed in more detail. pb is given, in the thermo-\ndynamic limit, by the fraction of patches involved in indirect particle-particle bonds. As there are two\ninvolved patches per particle-particle bond, this fraction is given by\n\npb(t) =\n2C2(t)\n\n?(0)\n= 2?\n\nC2\nC\n. (2.35)\n\nFor ? ? 1\n2\n, as all cells form two bonds in the final state, we obtain\n\npb(?) = 2? ,? ?\n1\n\n2\n, (2.36)\n\nwhich is independent of k. The general case is solved numerically and the results are shown in Fig. 2.4.\nThe predicted linear regime can be seen in Fig. 2.4 a). For ? > 0.5 there are not enough patches for\nall cells to form two bonds. Competition between free cells and occupied patches arises and is tunable\nthrough k. As k = k1/k0 increases, the rate of occupied patches turning into particle-particle bonds\n\n11\n\n\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\na)\np\n\nb\n\n?\n\nk=0.01\nk=0.10\nk=0.50\nk=1.00\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nb)\n\n?\n\nt=50.0\nt=0.5\nt=0.1\n\nFigure 2.4: a) Asymptotic value of the probability that a patch forms a cell-mediated bond with another patch as function of\n? for different values of k; b) Value of the probability that a patch forms a cell-mediated bond with another patch as function\nof ? for different values of time. Parameters are ?(0) = 14064, k0 = 9 \u00d7 10?3 and k1 = 5 \u00d7 10?4, resulting in a value of\nk = 5.6 \u00d7 10?2.\n\nincreases in relation to free cells turning into occupied patches. Consequently, there are more particle-\nparticle bonds in the final state. The limit k ? 0 corresponds to all free cells forming bonds before any\noccupied patch can find a free patch. The asymptotic pb is thus symmetric with respect to ? = 0.5,\n\nlim\nk?0\n\npb(?) =\n\n{\n2 ? 2? ,\n\n1\n\n2\n? ? ? 1, (2.37a)\n\n0 , 1 ? ?. (2.37b)\n\nThe limit k ? ? corresponds to occupied patches forming bonds with free patches as soon as they are\nformed. In the asymptotic state, pb is maximized for ? = 0.5, which is also the case where pb grows the\nfastest, as seen in Fig. 2.4 b).\nThe probability that a patch forms a cell-mediated bond with another patch depends on both k and ?.\nThe size and density of cells are system dependent. The ratio of cells to patches ? can be controlled by\nadjusting the density of particles in the injectable solution. The ratio of rate constants k can be controlled\nby adjusting the radius of the particles, which we manufacture in the lab. It was also shown that the time\nneeded for the scaffold to assemble can be fine-tuned, further showcasing the versatility of this method\nand the richness of its dynamics.\n\n2.2 With cell-cell adhesion\n\nLet us now consider the case where cells can adhere to each other. Thus, multiple cells can adhere to the\nsame patch and aggregates composed only of cells that have not formed bonds to any patch are possible.\nCell-cell adhesion is taken to be irreversible. We keep the definition of ?(t) as the density of free patches,\n\n12\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Illustration of the possible reactions when cell-cell bonds are allowed: a) Bond between a free cell/cell aggregate\nand a free patch, resulting in an occupied patch; b) bond between an occupied patch and a free patch, resulting in a particle-\nparticle bond; c) bond between free cells/cell aggregates, effectively decreasing C0; d) bond between an occupied patch and a\nfree cell/cell aggregate; e) bond between occupied patches, resulting in a particle-particle bond.\n\nhowever C0(t) is now the density of free cells and cell aggregates not forming a bond to a patch, C1(t)\nis the density of patches that form a bond to at least one cell (occupied patches), and C2(t) the density of\nbonds between two patches (mediated by one or more cell). Of importance is the fact that C0 + C1 + C2\nis not conserved. As cells are much smaller than particles, we consider that cell aggregates have the same\nradius and the same diffusion coefficient as a single cell. C0 is thus the sum of the densities of free cells\nand cell aggregates, and C1 is the effective density of occupied patches. The equations are as follows:?????????\n\n????????\n\nC?0 = ?k0C0??k0C0C1 ?\n1\n\n2\nk2C\n\n2\n0,\n\nC?1 = k0C0??k1C1??k1C21,\n\nC?2 = k1C1? +\n1\n\n2\nk1C\n\n2\n1,\n\n?? = ?k0C0??k1C1?.\n\n(2.38a)\n\n(2.38b)\n\n(2.38c)\n\n(2.38d)\n\nAll terms in eqs. (2.2a)\u2013(2.2d) appear in eqs. (2.38a)\u2013(2.38d) (see Fig. 2.5 a) and b)), with more terms\nbeing included as new mechanisms are present. The second term in (2.38a) accounts for the adhesion of\nmultiple cells to the same patch (see Fig. 2.5 d)) and the third term accounts for the formation of cell\naggregates (effectively removing free cells, see Fig. 2.5 c)). The factor of 1\n\n2\ncomes from the fact that\n\ntwo cell aggregates/free cells merge to form a larger cell aggregate. The third term in eq. (2.38b) and the\nsecond term in eq. (2.38c) reflect the possibility of forming bonds between occupied patches (mediated\nby one or more cells, see Fig. 2.5 e)). The factor of 1\n\n2\ncomes from the fact that, for every two occupied\n\npatches that form a bond, only one particle-particle bond is formed.\n\nThe rates k0 and k1 are given by eqs (2.5a) and (2.5b); k2 is the reaction rate of cell aggregates/free cells\nwith themselves and it is not independent of k0 and k1:\n\nk2 = 4?(Dc + Dc)(Rc + Rc) = 2\nkBT\n\n?\n= 2k0 ?k1. (2.39)\n\n13\n\n\n\nRescaling time (t ? k0t), and using eq. (2.39), we get:?????????\n????????\n\nC?0 = ?C0??kC0C1 ?\n2 ?k\n\n2\nC20,\n\nC?1 = C0??kC1??kC21,\n\nC?2 = kC1? +\nk\n\n2\nC21,\n\n?? = ?C0??kC1?.\n\n(2.40a)\n\n(2.40b)\n\n(2.40c)\n\n(2.40d)\n\nAllowing cell-cell adhesion (bonds) means that even two occupied patches can form cell-mediated bonds,\nand that increasing ? cannot decrease the density of particle-particle bonds. We may obtain an estimation\nfor pb(?) in the fast cell limit (Dc ? Dp) if we neglect cell aggregation (and thus dropping out the third\nterm in eq. (2.40a)). Let P be the total number of patches and C be the total number of cells. In the fast\ncell limit one can split the dynamics into two timescales: one where only cells diffuse and one where\nonly particles diffuse. After the first regime, the probability p0 that a patch does not form a bond to any\ncell after randomly assigning C cells to all patches is\n\np0 =\n\n(\nP ? 1\nP\n\n)C\n, (2.41)\n\nwhere we neglected correlations between patches and distributed cells uniformly. In the thermodynamic\nlimit (infinite system)\n\nlim\nP??\n\np0 = e\n??. (2.42)\n\nIn the second regime, occupied patches form cell-mediated bonds with other free or occupied patches.\nIn order to calculate the number of free patches after the second regime, we construct a system of rate\nequations. Let ?0 be the number of free patches and ?1 be the number of occupied patches. Then,\n\n{\n??0 = ?Q?0?1\n??1 = ?Q?0?1 ?Q?21,\n\n(2.43a)\n\n(2.43b)\n\nwhere Q is a constant reaction rate. The initial conditions are\n\n{\n?0(0) = ?p0\n\n?1(0) = ?(1 ?p0).\n(2.44a)\n\n(2.44b)\n\nWe have solved this system of equations to obtain the asymptotic value of ?0. In this limit, the value of\nQ is irrelevant.\n\n??0 = lim\nt??\n\n?0 = ? exp[1 ? exp(?) ??]. (2.45)\n\nWe can now calculate pb:\n\npb =\n????0\n?\n\n= 1 ? exp[1 ??? exp(?)]. (2.46)\n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2.6 a), the approximation of neglecting cell aggregates of eq. (2.46) predicts\nhigher values of pb than the ones obtained numerically from solving eqs. (2.40a)\u2013(2.40d). This is be-\ncause cell aggregates effectively reduce the number of possible particle-particle bonds.

(2.38a) into two equations. One equation\ndescribes the density of free cells Cf , and the other describes the density of cell aggregates Cc. The two\nare such that Cf + Cc = C0. As for eqs.

(2.47a) and (2.47b) relate to free cells and cell aggregates forming bonds with\nfree and occupied patches, respectively (see Fig. 2.7 a)-d)). The third term in eqs. (2.47a) and (2.47b)\nrefers to the formation of cell aggregates (see Fig. 2.7 e)). Cell aggregates grow by capturing other cell\naggregates and free cells, as reflected in the fourth term in eqs. (2.47a) and (2.47b) (see Fig. 2.7 f) and\ng)).\n\nWhile both Cc and Cf tend to zero, the proportion of C0 in the form of cell aggregates saturates to a\nconstant value that depends on ? (see Fig. 2.8). The ratio increases as ? increases, as there are less\npatches per cell, being more likely for free cells to find each other before they find free patches. The\nratio decreases with k; as free cells diffuse slower in relation to particles, it is less likely that free cells\nfind each other before finding a free patch.\n\n15\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Illustration of the possible reactions when cell-cell bonds are allowed. a),b) Bonds between a free patch and a free\ncell/cell aggregate, resulting in a occupied patch; c), d), e), f), g) bonds between cells, effectively decreasing C0.\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0\n\na)\n\nC\nc\n /\n\n (\n C\n\nf \n+\n\n C\nc\n)\n\nt\n5.0 10.0 15.0\n\nb)\n\nt\n5.0 10.0 15.0\n\nc)\n\nt\n\nk=0.01\nk=0.50\nk=0.90\n\nFigure 2.8: Value of the proportion of cell aggregates as a function of time for different values of k.

We have found that suppressing cell-cell adhesion results in higher values of\npb for values of ? lower than some threshold value ??(t), meaning that less cells are required in order to\nobtain the same bond probability. When allowing cell adhesion, many cells form cell aggregates and/or\nadhere to occupied patches, and so not every cell is used for forming bonds between particles, effectively\nlowering the value of ? as some are redundant. The threshold ratio of cells to patches ??(?) in the fast\ncell limit can be approximated using eqs. (2.37a), where we neglect cell aggregates, and eq. (2.46). The\napproximated ??(?) is such that\n\n1 ? 2??(?) + exp\n{\n\n1 ???(?) ? exp\n[\n??(?)\n\n]}\n= 0, (2.48)\n\nwhich has the numerical solution ??(?) ? 0.615. The numerical solution of eqs. (2.2a)\u2013(2.2d) and\n(2.38a)\u2013(2.38d) in the asymptotic limit, is displayed in Fig. 2.9 a). The threshold ratio of cells to patches\n??(?) is robust with changes in k, varying weakly around 0.649. Because the curves pb(?) for each\nmechanism increase roughly the same with k, their intersection at ??(?) is robust. In Fig. 2.9 b), we see\nthat ??(t) always begins at zero, but whether it monotonically increases or not depends on k. Allowing\ncell-cell adhesion may initially connect scaffolds faster, but suppressing it for ? . ?? will eventually\nresult in larger scaffolds.\nBond probability pb is maximized in the suppressed cell-cell adhesion case for ? = 0.5, for which a\nsignificant gain is obtained when compared with allowing cell-cell adhesion. This gain increases as\nk decreases, as seen in Fig. 2.10. The mechanism that optimizes scaffold production is the one in\nwhich cell-cell adhesion is suppressed. This mechanism optimizes the density of particle-particle bonds,\nmaking for a larger scaffold that self-assembles faster. Henceforth, we will consider only the suppressed\ncell-cell adhesion model.\n\n2.4 Percolation properties (mean-field)\n\nFigure 2.11: a) Bethe lattice for f = 3; c) and b) examples of aggregates that are and are not percolated, respectively. Red\nnodes and edges represent the aggregate. Image adapted from Cadilhe et al. (2007) [20].\n\nGiven the bond probability pb obtained in section 2.1, it is possible to study the aggregation of the\nparticles. We generalize to a case of particles with f patches. We neglect redundant bonds that link an\naggregate to itself (loops). Aggregates are thus tree-like and cutting any bond causes the aggregate to\nsplit into two. Cell-mediated bonds are taken to be uncorrelated, every patch having the same probability\n\n18\n\n\n\npb of being linked to a patch of a different particle. Spatial correlations are neglected, a particle can form\nbonds to any other particle, so long as they do not exceed f bonds. Neglecting correlations corresponds\nto taking the limit of infinite spatial dimensions (mean-field percolation). The Bethe lattice, a graph in\nwhich all nodes have f neighbors and no loops are formed (see Fig 2.11 a)) is a lattice representation\nof such a geometry [21]. An aggregate can thus be represented as a subset of the Bethe lattice in which\nnodes are particles and edges are bonds (see Fig 2.11 b) and c)).\n\nDepending on pb, there will be two phases, one in which there is a gel, an aggregate that spans the entire\nsystem (in the thermodynamic limit, it is infinite); and one where no gel is present. The order parameter\nis the fraction of particles present in the gel S(pb), which is non-zero only when there is a gel. Gelation\noccurs at bond probabilities higher than a critical bond probability p?b [22]. On average, the number of\nbonds leading out of a particle is (f ? 1)pb. In order to have an infinite system (see Fig 2.11 c) ) , the\nnumber of bonds leading out of any particle must be larger or equal than one on average, where equality\nis the condition for the critical point [23],\n\np?b =\n1\n\nf ? 1\n. (2.49)\n\nFor f = 6 as in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the critical probability is 1/5. Forming a scaffold requires gelation,\nas multiple disconnected aggregates do not provide the needed mechanical rigidity. In Fig. 2.12 a), we\ncan see systems with ? &lt;0.1 never form a scaffold. The interval of ? at which there is gelation has an\nupper-bound which is dependent on k, which means particles can be fabricated such that there is gelation\neven at high values of ?. Furthermore, it is possible to determine the time at which the gel is formed as\nfunction of ?, k0 and k1.\n\nThe existence of a gel does not require all particles of the system to belong to it. The fraction of particles\nin the giant aggregate S varies continuously from zero to one, and can provide information over the\nrheological and structural properties of the gel. As S increases, its surface area increases and the size of\nits pores decrease. Defining u as the probability that a random patch does not lead to the giant aggregate,\nthe probability that a particle is not connected to the giant aggregate is uf . As S is the probability that a\nparticle is part of the giant aggregate,\n\nS = 1 ?uf. (2.50)\n\nIf a patch does not lead to the giant aggregate, either it forms no bond at all (with probability 1 ? pb),\nor it leads to a particle that is also not part of the giant aggregate through other bonds (with probability\npbu\n\nf?1). The sum of the two probabilities is the probability u.\n\nu = 1 ?pb + pbuf?1, (2.51)\n\nuniquely determining the function u(pb) and, combined with eq. (2.50), determining the function S(pb).\nHowever, from eq. (2.51), it is not possible to obtain u(pb) analytically for a generic value of f, and we\nmust resort to numerical methods, as in Fig. 2.12 b). The phase transition at pb = 1/5 is clearly visible,\ncorresponding to the critical values of ? = {0.1, 0.9} (in the limit k ? 0). S(pb) saturates quickly;\nincreasing pb above 1/2 does not change the connectivity of the gel appreciably.\n\nThe rate eqs. (2.2a)\u2013(2.2d), combined with eqs. (2.50) and (2.51), provide a theory that describes both\nthe dynamics of the cells and of the scaffold as a whole. When developing it, we have always neglected\ncorrelations, which will lead to significant deviations from experiments on systems that are densely-\npacked, gelled, etc. In chapter 3, we introduce spatial correlations and study their effect through a lattice\n\n19\n\n\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\np\nb\n\n?\n\nk=0.01\nk=0.10\nk=0.50\nk=1.00\n\na)\n\nGelation\n\nNo gelation\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nS\n\npb\n\nb)\n\nFigure 2.12: Percolation for f = 6. a) pb as function of ? in the asymptotic limit.

All other patches remain accessible.\n\nIn chapter 2, we studied the dynamics of a 3D system of colloidal particles and cells through a mean-field\nset of rate equations. The mean-field approach neglects spatial correlations; to study their effect, we now\ndiscuss a lattice version of our model. Henceforth, particles are referred to as monomers. For simplicity,\nthe term \u201daggregate\u201d will include monomers. The size of an aggregate is defined as the number of\nmonomers in it; free monomers are aggregates of size one.\n\nMonomers occupy a lattice space and move by a sequence of random hops to their nearest neighbors.\nThe hopping rate is related to the diffusion coefficient Dm. Monomers have f patches on their surface,\nwhich is the maximum number of bonds they can form. A patch can be free and form no bond or it can\nbe occupied and form an irreversible bond to a cell. A patch cannot be occupied by more than one cell. A\nlattice space cannot be occupied by more than one monomer. The density of monomers nm is defined as\nthe ratio of lattice spaces occupied by monomers at t = 0. We study the very diluted regime (nm ? 1),\nand neglect the aggregate shape and orientation, as the characteristic time for aggregates to find each\nother is much larger than the timescale of rotational diffusion. We thus consider patches belonging to the\nsame aggregate to be uncorrelated.\n\n21\n\n\n\nAs in the previous chapter, there is a second species, the cells. Cells occupy a lattice space and hop\nwith a rate related to their diffusion coefficient Dc. A lattice space can be occupied by at most one cell.\nThe density of cells nc is defined as the ratio of lattice spaces occupied by cells at t = 0. Cells form\nirreversible bonds to patches. By forming a bond to a maximum of two patches, they mediate bonds\nbetween monomers. When a cell attempts to hop to a lattice space occupied by an aggregate or vice\nversa, the cell forms a bond to the aggregate with a probability pCA (see Fig. 3.1 a)),\n\npCA =\nF\n\nF + O\n, (3.1)\n\nwhere F and O are the number of free and occupied patches of the aggregate, respectively. pCA is the\nthe fraction of patches in the aggregate that are free.\n\nWhen an aggregate attempts to hop to a space already occupied by another aggregate, they form a cell-\nmediated bond with probability pAA (see Fig. 3.1 b)),\n\npAA =\nF1O2 + O1F2\n\n(F1 + O1)(F2 + O2)\n, (3.2)\n\nwhere F1,2 and O1,2 are the number of free and occupied patches and the subscript identifies the corre-\nsponding aggregate. pAA is the fraction of pairs of patches, one from each aggregate, where one is free\nand the other is occupied. pAA is zero when both aggregates only have free patches or only have occu-\npied patches. Despite aggregates occupying one lattice space, aggregate characteristics such as size and\nnumber of occupied patches are taken into account through the probabilities pCA and pAA. If no bond is\nformed, the collision is elastic and the cell or aggregate that is moving returns to its initial position. No\ncell-mediated bonds may be formed between monomers belonging to the same aggregate.\n\nThe number of free patches F , occupied patches O, and size S of an aggregate are not independent.\nWhen two free monomers form a bond, the resulting dimer is such that F = F1 + F2 ? 1 and O =\nO1 + O2 ? 1 = f ?F1 + f ?F2 ? 1. Generalizing for an aggregate composed of S monomers:\n\nF = F1 + F2 ? 1 + F3 ? 1 + ... =\nS?\ni=1\n\nFi ? (S ? 1),\n\nO = f ?F1 + f ?F2 ? 1 + f ?F3 ? 1 + ... = Sf ?\nS?\ni=1\n\nFi ? (S ? 1),\n\n(3.3)\n\n(3.4)\n\nand thus,\n\nF + O = S(f ? 2) + 2. (3.5)\n\nWe measured the average size of the aggregates ?S?(t) as a function of time defined as\n\n?S? =\nN\n\nNagg\n, (3.6)\n\nwhere N is the number of free monomers at t = 0 and Nagg(t) is the number of aggregates as a function\nof time. As all monomers are free at t = 0, Nagg(0) = N. We have also measured the size Smax(t) of\nthe largest aggregate as a function of time, and the bond probability pb(t), defined as the probability that\na patch forms a cell-mediated bond with a second patch as a function of time. Aggregates are tree-like\nand the number of bonds between the monomers composing an aggregate of size S is S?1; as for every\n\n22\n\n\n\nbond, there are two patches,\n\npb =\n2\n\nfN\n\nNagg?\na=1\n\n(Sa ? 1) =\n2(N ?Nagg)\n\nfN\n, (3.7)\n\nwhere a indexes the aggregates and Sa is the size of the a-th aggregate. All monomers and cells start\nfree. Let C be the number of cells at t = 0. We define ? as the ratio of cells to patches,\n\n? =\nC\n\nNf\n. (3.8)\n\nAn aggregate of size S will diffuse with the coefficient DSm. Since time can be rescaled, the dynamics\ndoes not depend on the absolute value of the diffusion coefficients, but on their relative value. We define\n? as the ratio of cell and free monomer diffusion coefficients:\n\n? =\nDc\nD1m\n\n. (3.9)\n\nHenceforth, we will rescale time such that D1m = 1.\n\nIn section 3.1, we outline the algorithm used in the simulations; in section 3.2, we study the limit of\nall aggregates having the same diffusion coefficient; in section 3.3, we study the limit where only free\nmonomers diffuse.\n\n3.1 Computational methods\n\nSimulations were performed on a 3D cubic lattice of linear length Lbox with a Monte Carlo algorithm\ninspired on the kinetic Monte Carlo method [24, 25], but with rejection sampling, as described below. As\nwe study the limit nm ? 1 , the discretization of the lattice does not significantly influence the results.\nPeriodic boundary conditions were used. Cells hop with rate qc and aggregates of size S hop with rate\nqSm. We keep track of the number of cells Nc and of aggregates of size S N\n\nS\nm. We consider hopping to be\n\nuncorrelated in space and time and so the total rate at which cells hop is Ncqc, and the total rate at which\naggregates of size S hop is NSmq\n\nS\nm. The total rate of hopping Q is then the sum over cells and aggregates\n\nof all sizes present in the simulation,\n\nQ = Ncqc + N\n1\nmq\n\n1\nm + N\n\n2\nmq\n\n2\nm + ... + N\n\nSmax\nm q\n\nSmax\nm . (3.10)\n\nA random uniform variable ? ? ]0, 1] is generated and used to pick if a cell or a particle attempts to hop.\nThe probability that a cell attempts to hop is Ncqc/Q; the probability that an aggregate of size S attempts\nto hop is NSmq\n\nS\nm/Q. A second random uniform variable is generated to pick the specific aggregate or\n\ncell that hops. A third random uniform variable picks a direction in which the hop is attempted. The\nsimulation clock is incremented whether the hop attempt is successful or not. As hopping is uncorrelated\nin time, the time between hops ?t is a random variable described by an exponential distribution and is\ngenerated by\n\n?t = ?\nlog(?)\n\nQ\n, (3.11)\n\nwhere ? is a uniformly generated random variable. This method of incrementing the simulation clock\npreserves the correct time evolution, provided that we use the physical rates for each process.\n\n23\n\n\n\nTo obtain the rates qc and qSm, we discretize the diffusion equation [17]. For simplicity, we take the 1D\ncase for a single monomer:\n\n?m\n\n?t\n= D1m\n\n?2m\n\n?x2\n, (3.12)\n\nwhere m(x,t) is the probability of finding the monomer in position x at time t, and D1m is the diffusion\ncoefficient of free monomers. Discretizing the partial derivatives in x, we obtain\n\n?m\n\n?t\n= D1m\n\nm(x + ?x) + m(x? ?x) ? 2m(x)\n?x2\n\n, (3.13)\n\nwhere ?x is the lattice constant. An initial condition such that m(x\u00b1 ?x) = 0 makes it clear that the\nhopping rate q1m is 2D\n\n1\nm/?x\n\n2. For 3D, we obtain\n\nqSm = 6\nDSm\n?x2\n\n. (3.14)\n\nIn the simulations, we set ?x =\n?\n\n6 and rescaled time such that q1m = D\n1\nm = 1. All simulations were\n\nfor f = 6.\n\nTo quantify the statistical error of a measurement, the standard error ?s(A) of measured quantity A was\ncalculated,\n\n?s(A) =\n?(A)?\nNsamples\n\n, (3.15)\n\nwhere ?(A) is the approximated standard deviation of A calculated from the measurements, and Nsamples\nis the number of measurements.\n\n3.2 Constant aggregate diffusion coefficient\n\nWe study the limit where all aggregates diffuse with the same coefficient,\n\nDSm = D\n1\nm = 1. (3.16)\n\nIn eqs. (2.2a)\u2013(2.2d), k is the ratio between the rate of cells forming a second bond and the rate of cells\nforming a first bond. When k ? 0, all cells form one bond before any cell can form two. If ? ? 0,\nthe density of occupied patches after all cells form one bond will be much lower than the density of free\npatches. Conversely, if ? ? 1, the density of free patches after all cells form one bond will be much\nlower than the density of occupied patches. As both occupied and free patches are required to form a\nbond, and because low densities decrease the effect of spatial correlations, the mean-field rate equations\nfit the simulations better for ? ? {0, 1}. Figure 3.2 shows spatial correlations between aggregates have\na significant effect on the dynamics, as the number of cells with zero, one and two bonds (C0, C1, C2,\nrespectively) obtained from eqs. (2.2a)\u2013(2.2d) and from the simulations deviate significantly outside of\nthe limits ? ?{0, 1}. Note that C0 in the lattice model corresponds to the number of free cells, C1 to the\nsum of all occupied patches, and C2 can be inferred from the number of aggregates Nagg as in eq. (3.7).\n\nFigure 3.3 shows that ?S?, Smax, and pb are non-monotonic as a function of ? and exhibit a constant\nvalue for ? ? [1/6, 5/6] in the asymptotic limit. To understand these results, we start by assuming an\ninterval of ? exists for which all cells form cell-mediated bonds and calculate the asymptotic value of\n\n24\n\n\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\na)\nC\n\n0\n,C\n\n1\n,C\n\n2\n\nt\n\nC0\nC1\nC2\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nb)\n\nt\n\nFigure 3.2: Comparison between the time evolution of the concentration of different types of cells as given by eqs.

C0 is\nthe number of cells with zero bonds, C1 is the number of cells with one bond, and C2 is the number of cells with two bonds.\nResults normalized such that C0 + C1 + C2 = 1. Lines were obtained by fitting parameters k0 and k1 through the minimum\nsquares method, resulting in k ?{0.06, 0.02}. Results averaged over 200 samples.\n\n?S? in that interval. As aggregates are tree-like, for every cell-mediated bond, two aggregates merge:\n\nNagg(?) = N ?C =\nC\n\nf?\n?C. (3.17)\n\nUsing eqs. (3.6) and (3.17), we find ?S? for the interval of ? for which all cells form two bonds eventually.\n\n?S?(?) =\nN\n\nN ?C\n=\n\n1\n\n1 ?f?\n, ? ?\n\n1\n\nf\n. (3.18)\n\nIn eq. (3.18), ?S? diverges at ? = 1/f, which corresponds to one cell per monomer; in this case, all\nmonomers will eventually belong to the same aggregate (see Fig. 3.4 b)) and ?S? = Smax = N. A\nlarger value of ? does not result in more cell-mediated bonds because aggregates are tree-like and there\ncannot be more bonds than N ? 1. If there is more than f ? 1 cells per monomer, not all monomers can\nform cell-mediated bonds due to lack of empty patches. There arises a competition between cells with\none bond and free cells for the last empty patches. ?S? is thus determined by ?. In the limit of cells\ndiffusing must faster than aggregates (? ? ?), dynamics are split in two regimes. The first is the cell\nregime, in which only cells diffuse. All cells form one bond in the cell regime for ? ? 1. When ? ??\nand ? = 1, all patches are occupied at the end of the cell regime, thus a larger number of cells such that\n? > 1 does not influence the aggregation. The interesting range when ? ?? is ? ? [0, 1]. Afterwards\ncomes the aggregate regime, in which only aggregates diffuse.

(3.6) and (3.7), we obtain\n\n?S?\npb\n\n=\nf\n\n2\n\n?S?2\n\n?S?? 1\n. (3.23)\n\nDeriving both sides of eq. (3.7) results in,\n\np?b\n??S?\n?1\n\n=\n2\n\nf?S?2\n. (3.24)\n\nCombining eqs. (3.23) and (3.24), we obtain\n\np?b\npb\n\n(\n?S??\n?S?\n\n)?1\n=\n\n1\n\n?S?? 1\n. (3.25)\n\nAt initial times, when ?S? ? 1, the ratio of the relative variation in pb is much larger than the relative\nvariation of ?S?. At later times, when ?S? ? 1, the opposite happens. Thus pb is not a good variable if\none is interested in the time evolution of large tree-like aggregates.\n\nWhen ? is finite and the timescales of aggregate and cell diffusion are not separable, cell-mediated\n\nbonds can occur between aggregates before all cells form a bond. For ?&lt;\n1\n\nf\n, the asymptotic value\n\nof ?S?/N, Smax/N and pb does not depend on ?. It does not matter if all cells form a bond before\naggregates form cell-mediated bonds as there are enough free patches for all cells to form two bonds\neventually. For tree-like aggregates, the number of cell-mediated bonds cannot be larger than N ?1. For\n1\n\nf\n&lt;?&lt;\n\nf ? 1\nf\n\n, there is between one and f ? 1 cells per monomer and all monomers eventually form\ncell-mediated bonds, regardless of the value of ?.\n\nWhen ? ? ? and ? >\nf ? 1\nf\n\n, there are less empty patches than there are monomers at the end of the\n\ncell regime and a giant aggregate that contains all monomers cannot form. When ? is finite, there arises\na competition for the last free patches between free cells and cells with one bond, which is regulated by\n\n27\n\n\n\n0.00\n\n0.20\n\n0.40\n\n0.60\n\n0.80\n\n1.00\n\n0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00\n\n?\n=\n\n5\n/6\n\na)\n\n<\nS\n\n>\n/N\n\n?\n\n0.00\n\n0.20\n\n0.40\n\n0.60\n\n0.80\n\n1.00\n\n0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00\n\nb)\n\nS\nm\n\na\nx\n/N\n\n?\n\n0.00\n\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.30\n\n0.40\n\n0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00\n\nc)\n\np\nb\n\n?\n\n?=1\u00d710\n-5\n\n?=1\u00d710\n0\n\n?=5\u00d710\n0\n\n?=1\u00d710\n1\n\n?=1\u00d710\n5\n\nFigure 3.5: Aggregate measurements as a function of ? for different values of ? at t = 3 \u00d7 105: a) normalized average size of\nthe aggregates ?S?/N; b) normalized size of the largest aggregate Smax/N; c) bond probability pb. Parameters are Lbox = 25,\nf = 6, nm = 0.1, Dm = 1. Simulations were averaged over 250 samples. The dashed line corresponds to ? = 5/6, which is\npredicted to be the lower bound of the interval of ? in which the asymptotic values of ?S?, Smax and pb depend on ?.\n\n?. The faster aggregates diffuse when compared to cells, the likelier it is to find other aggregates and\nform a cell-mediated bond before free cells can form bonds to the remaining empty patches; thus a lower\nvalue of ? results in increased ?S?/N, Smax/N, and pb.\nFigure 3.5 shows ?S?/N, Smax/N, and pb at t = 3 \u00d7 105 for three values of ? for which the timescales\nof cell and aggregate diffusion are not separable, as well as the limits ? ? 1 and ? ? 1. It was found\nthat increasing ? above 105 or decreasing ? below 10?5 did not change the three measurements at the\nsimulated density of nm = 0.1. Unphysical effects regarding the discretization of the lattice arise at\nhigher values of nm. Because the lattice model of this chapter is most valid in the limit nm ? 0, a study\nof the influence of nm is not provided in this chapter. Chapter 4 goes into greater detail on the effects of\nnm and of finite-size effects.\n\nTo obtain a more complete picture of the dynamics, we introduce the weighted size distribution d(S,t),\ndefined as the fraction of monomers which are part of aggregates of size S at time t. Note that d(S = 1, t)\nis the number of free monomers and\n\n??\nS=1\n\nd(S,t) = 1. (3.26)\n\nd(S,t) is related to the standard size distribution s(S,t), defined as the fraction of aggregates which have\nsize S at time t through\n\nd(S,t) =\ns(S,t)S\n??\nl=1\n\ns(l, t)l\n\n=\n1\n\n?S?(t)\ns(S,t)S.

Not shown is the limit d(S,t ? ?) = ?S,N (?i,j is the\nKroenecker delta), where all monomers form a single aggregate.\n\n3.3 Diffusion of only free monomers\n\nIn this section, we study the limit where diffusion of aggregates with size larger than one can be neglected\nin the timescale of free monomer diffusion. For simplicity, hereafter we will refer to these aggregates as\nsimply \u201caggregates\u201d. There are thus three timescales in the limit ? ? ?, and the dynamics separate\ninto three regimes. First is the cell regime, in the diffusion of cells dominates. All cells form one bond in\nthe cell regime. Afterwards is the monomer regime in which the diffusion of free monomers dominates.\nFinally there is the aggregate regime where the diffusion of aggregates dominates.

(3.30)\n\nFigure 3.7 shows that ?S? is initially maximized at ? = 0.5 as seen in section 3.2, however the asymptotic\nstate is fundamentally different from the ones seen before, as all three quantities exhibit a bimodal shape\nwith local maxima in ? = {0.12, 0.88}\u00b1 0.01 and ? = 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 corresponding to a local minimum.\n\nLet us consider the distribution of occupied patches per monomer dO(n), defined as the probability that\na monomer has n occupied patches immediately after the cell regime. Immediately after the cell regime,\nall monomers are free. To obtain dO(n), we solve a set of mean-field rate equations for the cell regime as\nin chapter 2.

The initial conditions for eqs. (3.31a)\u2013(3.31c) are\n\nC0(0) = ?fN,\n\nMi(0) = N?i,0 , 0 ? i ? f,\n(3.32a)\n\n(3.32b)\n\nwhere N is the total number of free monomers which is conserved in the cell regime. Thus,\n\ndO(n) =\nMn(?)\nN\n\n. (3.33)\n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 3.8, the asymptotic solution of eqs. (3.31a)\u2013(3.31c) is a binomial distribution with\nf trials and probability of success equal to the ratio of cells to patches ?,\n\ndO(n) =\n\n(\nf\n\nn\n\n)\n?n(1 ??)f?n, (3.34)\n\nand is in agreement with simulations.\n\nIf there is much less than one linker per monomer, monomers with only free patches dominate; if there\nis between one and f ? 1 cells per monomer, monomers with both free and occupied patches dominate;\nif there is much more than f ? 1 linkers per monomer, monomers with only occupied patches dominate.\nSince it requires one free and one occupied patch to form a bond, free monomers with both occupied and\nfree patches can form bonds with any other free monomer. By contrast, free monomers with only occu-\npied patches cannot form bonds among each other, likewise for free monomers with only free patches.\nAs aggregates are immobile, they may only grow through linker-mediated bonds with free monomers. If\nthere is much less than one cell per monomer, all cells form a second bond but they are not numerous\n\n31\n\n\n\nenough for all monomers to form cell-mediated bonds in the asymptotic limit. Larger values of ? result\nin a larger number of cells and ?S?. Figure 3.9 a) shows that the values of ? = {0.12, 0.88}\u00b1 0.01\n\nFigure 3.9: a) Asymptotic number of free monomers Nmon and number of aggregates of size larger than one Nstat; b) average\nsize of the aggregates ?S?. Points are simulation data with parameters Lbox = 25, f = 6, nm = 0.01, ? = 103. Results were\naveraged over 500 samples. Purple lines in b) are obtained from eqs. (3.18) and (3.20). Green line in b) and both lines in a) are\nobtained from the asymptotic numerical solution of eqs. (3.35a)\u2013(3.35c); the blue line in a) also requires the use of eq. (3.38);\nc) diagram illustrating the mechanism behind the maxima; particles in purple, empty orange circles are free patches and filled\norange circles are occupied patches. Monomers with only free or occupied patches must form bonds to monomers with both\nfree and occupied patches. When monomers with both free and occupied patches dominate, the tendency is to mainly form\ndimers.\n\ncorresponding to the maxima coincide with the edges of the interval of ? in which all monomers form\ncell-mediated bonds in the asymptotic limit (number of free monomers Nmon = 0). In this limit and\ninterval, ?S? is determined by the number of aggregates. Monomers with only free or occupied patches\ncannot form cell-mediated bonds with each other. A distribution dO(n) with less of these monomers in-\ncreases the number of aggregates (mostly as dimers) and decreases ?S?. Figure 3.9 a) shows the number\nof aggregates is maximized at ? = 0.5, which corresponds to the value of ? that maximizes\n\n?f?1\nn=1 dO(n).\n\n32\n\n\n\nThe values of ? which minimize the number of monomers with both free and occupied patches in the\ninterval in which Nmon = 0 thus correspond to the maxima in ?S?. The smaller of those values is\n? = 0.12 \u00b1 0.01. If there is much more than f ? 1 cells per monomer, the number of free patches after\nthe cell regime is not enough for all monomers to form cell-mediated bonds. Larger values of ? decrease\nthe number of free patches and ?S?. The mechanism behind the first maximum leads to a second maxi-\nmum in ?S? at ? = 0.88 \u00b1 0.01. When ? ?? and spatial correlations can be neglected, the dynamics\nare symmetrical to swapping free and occupied patches and ?S? is symmetrical with respect to ? = 0.5.\nWe calculate the number of aggregates Nstat with a set of mean-field balance equations for the monomer\nregime using the distribution dO as initial conditions. Following the same principles as in chapter 2,\nwe define Nstat(t) as the number of aggregates as a function of time, Nboth(t) as the number of free\nmonomers with both free and occupied patches, and Nonly(t) as the number of free monomers with only\nfree or occupied patches,\n\nN?stat = q0 NbothNonly +\nq0\n2\nN2both,\n\nN?both = ?q0 NbothNonly ?q0 N2both ?q1 NbothNstat,\nN?only = ?q0 NbothNonly ?q1 NonlyNstat,\n\n(3.35a)\n\n(3.35b)\n\n(3.35c)\n\nwith initial conditions,\n\nNstat(0) = 0,\n\nNboth(0) = N\n\nf?1?\nn=1\n\ndO(n),\n\nNonly(0) = N( dO(0) + dO(f) ),\n\n(3.36a)\n\n(3.36b)\n\n(3.36c)\n\nwhere N is the number of monomers at t = 0. In eqs. (3.35a)\u2013(3.35c), we have neglected aggregates\nwith only free or occupied patches by performing the approximation that all free monomers can form\nbonds to all aggregates. We neglected also the effect of the size of aggregates and of the number of free\nand occupied patches of free monomers and aggregates on the aggregation rates by considering constant\nrate constants q0 and q1. Free monomers form bonds with each other at a rate q0 and with aggregates at a\nrate q1. Since aggregates are immobile, q1 = q0/2 [18]. The absolute value of q0 does not influence the\nasymptotic result. We have also neglected aggregation between monomers with only occupied patches\nand only free patches. The shape of eq. (3.34) is such that aggregation between these two monomers is\nmuch rarer than aggregation between them and monomers with both free and occupied patches for all\nvalues of ?.\n\nFigure 3.9 b) shows N/Nstat obtained from the asymptotic numerical solutions of eqs. (3.35a)\u2013(3.35c).\nFor ? ? [0.12, 0.88], the asymptotic number of free monomers is zero and N/Nstat = ?S?. When\nthe asymptotic number of free monomers is different from zero, we may use eqs. (3.18) and (3.20) to\nobtain ?S?. The values of ? which correspond to the maxima in ?S? can be obtained by the intersections\nof ?S? obtained from eqs. (3.18) and (3.20) with N/Nstat obtained from eqs. (3.35a)\u2013(3.35c). These\nintersections coincide with the edges of the interval of ? in which Nmon = 0 and thus with the maxima\nin ?S?. The maxima derived theoretically are in very good agreement with the ones obtained from the\nsimulations, as shown in Fig. 3.9 b), validating our proposed mechanism.\n\nWe define the average size of aggregates ?S?stat\n\n?S?stat =\nN ?Nmon\nNstat\n\n, (3.37)\n\n33\n\n\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20\n\nNonly=Nmon\n\na)\nN\n\nb\no\nth\n\n, \nN\n\no\nn\nly\n\n, \nN\n\nst\na\nt\n\nt\n\nNonly\nNboth\nNstat\n\n2.0\n\n2.4\n\n2.7\n\n3.1\n\n3.4\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nb)\n\n<\nS\n\n>\nst\n\na\nt\n\n?\n\nMean field\nSimulations\n\nFigure 3.10: a) Numerical solution of eqs.

Figure 3.10 b) shows ?S?stat\nexhibits a bimodal shape with its maxima in the same values of ? as ?S?. The mechanism is similar as for\n?S?. When there is much less than one cell per monomer, monomers with zero or one occupied patches\ndominate; only dimers can form and ?S?stat = 2. A larger number of cells enables the formation of larger\naggregates until there are enough cells for all monomers to form a cell-mediated bond; ?S?stat = ?S?\nfor ? ? [0.12, 0.88]. If there is much more than f ? 1 cells per monomer, monomers with f ? 1 and f\noccupied patches dominate and only dimers can form.\nKnowing that the total number of aggregates of all sizes Nagg = Nmon + Nstat, we rearrange equation\n(3.6),\n\nNmon =\nN\n\n?S?\n?Nstat. (3.38)\n\nNstat is obtained from eqs. (3.35a)\u2013(3.35c). Meanwhile, when Nmon 6= 0 in the asymptotic limit, ?S? is\nobtained from eqs. (3.18) and (3.20). We can therefore calculate Nmon using eq. (3.38) and ?S?stat (see\nFig. 3.9 a) and b)).\nEquations (3.35a)\u2013(3.35c) predict all monomers form bonds with aggregates for all values of ? (asymp-\ntotically Nboth,Nonly ? 0), which is seemingly incompatible with the results of Fig. 3.9 a)). To\nunderstand why the calculated values of Nmon, Nstat, ?S?, and ?S?stat match the simulations despite\nthis difficulty, we show in Fig. 3.10 a) the time evolution of Nboth and Nonly for a value of ? in which\nNmon 6= 0. Because Nboth tends to zero earlier than Nonly and because Nonly cannot form aggregates\nwith itself, after some time Nstat remains approximately constant despite the value of Nonly. We then\ncalculate the correct value of Nmon using eqs. (3.18), (3.20), and (3.38).\n\n34\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe role of the shape of aggregates\n\nFigure 4.1: Illustration of the main ingredients of the lattice model: a) diffusion; b) rotation (free monomers only); c) formation\nof bonds between cells and aggregates leading to a free patch becoming occupied; d) formation of cell-mediated bonds between\ntwo aggregates.\n\nIn chapter 3, we studied the dynamics of a 3D system of monomers and cells through a lattice model\nwhere every aggregate occupied one lattice space, neglecting aggregate shape and patch correlations. In\nthis chapter, we study a lattice model where these correlations are accounted for. For simplicity, the term\n\u201daggregate\u201d will include monomers. The size of an aggregate is defined as the number of monomers in\nit; free monomers are aggregates of size one.\nMonomers occupy a lattice space and move by a sequence of random hops to their nearest neighbors\n(see Fig. 4.1 a)). The hopping rate is related to the translational diffusion coefficient Dm. A lattice space\ncannot be occupied by more than one monomer. The density of monomers nm is defined as the ratio of\nlattice spaces occupied by monomers at t = 0. Monomers have a number f of patches on their surface\ngiven by the coordination number of the underlying lattice. f is the maximum number of bonds they can\nform. A patch can be free and form no bond or it can be occupied and form an irreversible bond to a cell.\nA patch cannot be occupied by more than one cell. Each patch points to one of the nearest neighbors of\nthe monomer, which undergoes rigid rotations with a rate related to the rotational diffusion coefficient\n\n35\n\n\n\nDr (see Fig. 4.1 b)).\nAs in the previous chapters, there is a second species, the cells. Cells occupy a lattice space and hop\nwith a rate related to their diffusion coefficient Dc. A lattice space can be occupied by at most one cell.\nThe density of cells nc is defined as the ratio of lattice spaces occupied by cells at t = 0. Cells form\nirreversible bonds to patches. By forming a bond to a maximum of two patches, they mediate bonds\nbetween monomers. If a monomer and cell are adjacent and the patch of the monomer pointing towards\nthe cell is free, then it is possible for one to hop to the lattice space occupied by the other. If so, the patch\nof the monomer which pointed towards the cell becomes occupied (see Fig. 4.1 c)).\nWhen a monomer is adjacent to another monomer, the two form an irreversible cell-mediated bond if the\ntwo patches that point to one another include one free and one occupied patch (see Fig. 4.1 d)). Cell-\nmediated bonds between free monomers can occur after a hop or a rotation and results in a dimer. We\nneglect the rotation of aggregates of size larger than one. An aggregate of size S hops with a rate related\nto the diffusion coefficient DSm, such that all monomers that belong to it hop in the same direction. An\naggregate may not hop if it is not possible for a monomer that belongs to it to hop, i.e when the adjacent\nlattice space is occupied by another monomer or occupied by a cell and the patch that points to it is\noccupied.\nUnlike in the model discussed in chapter 3, aggregates may not be tree-like. Let S be the size of an\naggregate, F and O be its number of free and occupied patches, respectively. Since for every cell-\nmediated bond an occupied and a free patch are used,\n\nO + F = Sf ? 2Nbonds, (4.1)\n\nwhere Nbonds is the number of cell-mediated bonds formed between monomers belonging to the aggre-\ngate. Nbonds can be split into two contributions,\n\nNbonds = S ? 1 + NL, (4.2)\n\nwhere S ? 1 is the number of bonds in a tree-like aggregate and NL is the number of redundant bonds,\nfrom which result loops. Combining eqs. (4.1) and (4.2), we obtain\n\nO + F = S(f ? 2) + 2 ? 2NL, (4.3)\n\nwhich is the general form of eq. (3.5) for any aggregate.\nWe measured the average size of the aggregates ?S?(t) as a function of time defined as\n\n?S? =\nN\n\nNagg\n, (4.4)\n\nwhere N is the number of free monomers at t = 0 and Nagg(t) is the number of aggregates as a function\nof time. As all monomers are free at t = 0, Nagg(0) = N. We have also measured the size Smax(t) of\nthe largest aggregate as a function of time, and the bond probability pb, defined as the probability that a\npatch forms a cell-mediated bond with a second patch as a function of time. To characterize the shape of\naggregates, we measure the fraction of all bonds which are redundant nL.\nAll monomers and cells start free. Let C be the number of cells at t = 0. We define ? as the ratio of cells\nto patches,\n\n? =\nC\n\nNf\n. (4.5)\n\n36\n\n\n\nAn aggregate of size S will diffuse with the coefficient DSm. Since time can be rescaled, the dynamics\ndoes not depend on the absolute value of the diffusion coefficients, but on their ratio. We define ? as the\nratio of cell and free monomer diffusion coefficients:\n\n? =\nDc\nD1m\n\n. (4.6)\n\nHenceforth, we will rescale time such that D1m = 1. We assume the timescale of monomer rotation is of\nthe same order of the timescale of monomer diffusion and set\n\nDr = D\n1\nm = 1. (4.7)\n\nWhile the model is defined for a generic DSm, here only the limit where only free monomers diffuse was\nstudied (section 4.2).\n\n4.1 Computational methods\n\nIn chapter 3, the algorithm used was rejection-based in the sense that it could attempt an event that is\nnot successful, e.g. a cell attempting to hop to a lattice space already occupied by a cell. While the\ncorrect time evolution is obtained and its implementation is simpler, the rejection-based algorithm is\ncomputationally inefficient. In the present chapter, simulations are performed with the rejection-free\nkinetic Monte Carlo method [24, 25].\nCells hop with rate qc. We consider diffusion to be isotropic and so the rate of hopping in a certain\ndirection q?c is\n\nq?c =\nqc\nz\n, (4.8)\n\nwhere z is the coordination number of the underlying lattice. Aggregates of size S hop with rate q?Sm . Free\nmonomers rotate along a certain axis with rate q?r. A list containing all possible events (i.e. all possible\nhops and rotations) is updated at every time step. The next event is chosen from this list with a probability\nproportional to its rate. Choosing from the list ensures no events are rejected and considerably reduces\nthe computational demands when compared to the rejection-based algorithm in chapter 3.\nWe consider events to be uncorrelated in space and time and so the total rate of events Q is the sum of the\nrates of all events in the list. The time between hops ?t is a random variable described by an exponential\ndistribution and is generated by\n\n?t = ?\nlog(?)\n\nQ\n, (4.9)\n\nwhere ? ? ]0, 1] is a uniformly generated random variable. This method of incrementing the simulation\nclock preserves the correct time evolution.\nThe rates q?c and q\n\n?S\nm are obtained with an argument similar to chapter 3. For any dimension, we obtain\n\nq?c =\nDc\n\n?x2\n, (4.10)\n\nq?Sm =\nDSm\n?x2\n\n, (4.11)\n\nwhere Dc and DSm are the diffusion coefficients of cells and aggregates of size S respectively, and ?x\nis the lattice constant. Simulations were performed on a 3D cubic lattice of linear length Lbox using\nperiodic boundary conditions. To keep consistency with the simulations in chapter 3, we set ?x =\n\n?\n6\n\n37\n\n\n\nand rescale time such that q?\n1\n\nm = D\n1\nm/6 = 1/6. As we study the limit nm ? 1, the discretization of\n\nthe lattice does not significantly influence the results. It is assumed that the the timescale of rotation of\nmonomers is of the same order as the timescale of diffusion of monomers and so we set\n\nq?r = q\n?1\nm. (4.12)\n\nAll simulations were for f = 6. A monomer is thus described by a three-dimensional position vector ~x\nand a six-dimensional configuration vector ~o related to the occupancy of the patches. A simple way to\nreduce the memory usage of the event list is mapping both vectors to integers. The position vector ~x\n\n~x = {x1,x2,x3}, (4.13)\n\nis mapped to an integer X (where x1,x2,x3 are integers),\n\nX = x1 + x2Lbox + x3L\n2\nbox. (4.14)\n\nThe reverse mapping is\n\nx1 =\n(\nX%L2box\n\n)\n%Lbox, (4.15)\n\nx2 =\n(\nX%L2box\n\n)\n//Lbox, (4.16)\n\nx3 = X//L\n2\nbox, (4.17)\n\nwhere the functions a%b and a//b are the remainder of the division of a by b and the integer division of\na by b, respectively. This transformation is a one-to-one correspondence as 0 ? x1,x2,x3 &lt;Lbox. The\nconfiguration vector ~o is written explicitly as\n\n~o = {o1,o2,o3,o4,o5,o6}, (4.18)\n\nwhere the coordinates oi are Booleans with 1 indicating an occupied patch and 0 a free patch. The\nvariable i indexes the direction the patch is facing. In the same style as with ~x, ~o is transformed to an\ninteger O,\n\nO =\n6?\ni=1\n\noi2\ni?1, (4.19)\n\nwith the inverse transformation given iteratively,{\no6 = O//2\n\n5 (4.20a)\n\noi =\n(\noi+1%2\n\ni\n)\n//2i?1 , 1 ? i ? 5. (4.20b)\n\n4.2 Diffusion of only free monomers\n\nIn section 3.3, we studied the limit where diffusion of aggregates of size larger than one can be neglected\nin the timescale of free monomer diffusion. We therefore referred to aggregates of size larger than one\nas \u201caggregates\u201d and\n\nDSm = ?S,1, (4.21)\n\nwhere ?i,j is the Kroenecker delta.\n\n38\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Snapshot of a simulation.

Simulation\nparameters are Lbox = 25, nm = 0.01, ? = 1000. Simulations were averaged over 500 samples. a) Number of free monomers\nNmon and aggregates of size larger than one Nstat; b) average size of aggregates and monomers ?S? and average size of the\naggregates ?S?stat.\n\nA snapshot of a simulation can be found in Fig. 4.3. When cells are much faster than monomers\n(? ? ?), the dynamics separate into two regimes. First is the cell regime, in which only cells diffuse.\nAll cells form one bond in the cell regime. Afterwards is the monomer regime where only free monomers\n\n39\n\n\n\ndiffuse.\nWe measured the average size of aggregates and monomers ?S? and the average size of aggregates ?S?stat\ndefined as\n\n?S?stat =\nN ?Nmon\nNstat\n\n, (4.22)\n\nwhere Nmon is the number of free monomers. It was found that both the asymptotic values of ?S?\nand ?S?stat exhibited bimodal shapes when mapped as function of ?. These bimodal shapes arose in\nthe point-like model of chapter 3 due to the form of the distribution of occupied patches after the cell\nregime. A mean-field theory was developed which captured the physics. Figure 4.3 shows the bimodal\nshape is present in the model introduced in this chapter. Figure 4.4 b) shows that the bimodal shape is\nnot a finite-size effect, but caused by the mechanism discussed in chapter 3.\n\nFigure 4.4: a) Fraction of bonds which are redundant nL as a function of ? for two values of time. Simulations were averaged\nover 2500 samples. Dashed lines represent the values of ? which maximize ?S? and ?S?stat. b) Average size of aggregates ?S?\nas function of L?1box for different value of ?. Simulation parameters are nm = 0.01, ? = 10\n\n3. Simulations were averaged over\n{1000, 500, 250, 100} samples for Lbox = {16, 25, 32, 64}, respectively.\n\nTo quantify the inter-connectivity of the aggregates, we measure the fraction of bonds which are redun-\ndant nL. In Fig. 4.4 a), it can be seen that nL &lt;1% for all values of ?. Because the average size of the\naggregates is at most ? 3.25, it is noteworthy to mention that only aggregates of size larger than three\nmay exhibit loops in a cubic lattice, which partially explains the low values of nL. Also relevant is the\nfact that redundant bonds occur when a free monomer forms more than one bond to an aggregate in the\nsame time step, which is a much rarer event that the formation of a single bond. Larger values of ?S?stat\nincrease the probability that a free monomer is adjacent to two or more monomers belonging to the same\naggregate. Despite ?S?stat being maximized for ? = {0.12, 0.88}\u00b10.01, no maxima are present in nL at\nthose values of ?. The variation in ?S?stat is too small to play a decisive role in nL. The formation of two\nor more bonds requires more than just adjacency of multiple monomers, it also requires that the patches\nbetween monomers form free/occupied pairs. If we discard the effect of ?S?stat, the probability of a free\n\n40\n\n\n\nmonomer forming a second cell-mediated bond after forming a first link is maximized for ? = 0.5, in\nwhich the total number of free and occupied patches is equal.\n\nFigure 4.5: Dependency on ratio of cell and monomer diffusion coefficient ? in the asymptotic limit of a) the height of\nthe maxima and minimum in the average size of aggregates ?S?; b) the number of dimers Ndim. Squares correspond to\n?max1 = 0.12 and triangles to ?max2 = 0.88. Dashed line separates the region of parameters in which cells diffuse faster than\nmonomers (left) from the region in which monomers diffuse faster than cells (right). Simulations were performed on a system\nof lateral size Lbox = 25, monomer density of nm = 0.01, and averaged over 500 samples.\n\nUntil now, we have considered the case of cell diffusion much faster than monomer diffusion ? ? 1.\nFor a finite ?, the timescale of cell diffusion is no longer separable from that of monomer diffusion,\n\n41\n\n\n\nmeaning cells can form a second bond before all cells form a first bond. While the values of ?max1,\n?min and ?max2 do not change with ?, ?S? does. In the asymptotic limit and ? ? 0, it was found that\nthere is an initial regime in which larger values of ? increase ?S?, evolving to a plateau in which ?S?\nis constant with ? (up to the largest measured value of ? = 1.0). In particular, the maxima disappear.\nFigure 4.5 displays the effect of ? in the maxima and minimum of ?S?. The order of magnitude of the\nvalue of ? at which the maximum for ?max1 disappears differs from that of ?max2.\n\nAs shown in chapter 3, the maxima are due to low rates of formation of bonds between monomers\nwith only free or occupied patches, which lowers the number of dimers when compared to ?min. The\ndisappearing of the maxima is thus associated with an increased number of dimers, as seen in Fig. 4.5\nb). Because some but not all cells form bonds to patches, a system with finite ? behaves like a system\nwith ? ?? but with an effective value of ? that is lower, provided there are more than enough cells for\nall monomers to form cell-mediated bonds. For ?max2, this lower effective ? causes more monomers to\nhave both free and occupied patches which increases the number of dimers, resulting in lower ?S? when\n? . 102. For ?min, the effective reduction in ? does not change ?S? much as the number of monomers\nwith both free and occupied patches does not change much.\n\nThe mechanism that increases the number of dimers for ?max1 is different than for ?max2 because there\nare barely enough cells for all monomers to form cell-mediated bonds and the equivalence with the case\n? ? ? and lower effective ? is not valid. While monomers do not have enough occupied patches for\nall of them to form cell-mediated bonds when their diffusion starts to be relevant around ? ? 102, there\nare still enough cells in total and we must simply wait longer times to retain the maximum.Therefore,\nthe mechanism for the increase in the number of dimers in ?max1 is different and visible only when\n? . 1. When ? ? 0, the relevant timescale is given by the diffusion of monomers. For ? . 1, cells\nare mainly static, and monomers are responsible for dimer formation (through formation of bonds with\nstatic linkers) as seen in Fig. 4.5 b). The longer timescale of linker diffusion results on a later arrival to\nthe empty patches of already static aggregates (dimers), minimizing further aggregation.\n\nTo finish this section, we verify that varying monomer density nm does not suppress the bimodal shape\nof ?S? when nm ? 1 and ? ??. Figure 4.6 shows the asymptotic height of the maxima and minimum\nof ?S? as function of nm and the inset shows their corresponding value of ?. It was found that, when\nnm ? 1, the height of the maxima and minimum scale linearly with nm,\n\n?S?? nm , nm ? 1. (4.23)\n\nExtrapolating to find the height of the maxima in the limit nm ? 0, it is found that they are equal. In\nthis limit, spatial correlations are non-existent and ?S? is symmetrical, as predicted by the analysis of\nchapter 3. Spatial correlations play a larger role in systems with larger value of nm, e.g. two aggregates\nmerging due to a monomer forming a bridge between them. In these systems, the curve ?S?(?) has an\nasymmetry.\n\nThe linear fits for ?S?(?min) and ?S?(?max1) intersect for nm ? 0.48. For nm > 0.48, the bimodal\nshape of ?S? is not present. This conclusion is consistent with the results seen in the inset of Fig. 4.6,\nas the value of ?min approaches the value of ?max1, which remains constant with nm. Simulations were\nperformed for nm = 0.55 and no maximum was found in the range ? ? [0.11, 0.13].\nAt values of nm large enough such that nm + nc is comparable to 1, the dynamics are effected by the\ndiscretization, e.g. cubic vs. hexagonal lattice. Such dependency on the underlying lattice is unphysical\nas the on-lattice models of this chapter and of chapter 3 are simplifications of a continuous system.\nThe limit in which the results of our on-lattice models are most realistic is the limit nm ? 0, where\n\n42\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Dependency on monomer density nm of the maxima and minimum in the asymptotic ?S?. Lines were obtained\nwith minimum square fits. Inset shows the value of ratio of cells to patches ? at which the maxima and minimum were found.\nSquares refer to the smallest local maximum found, circles to the local minimum, and triangles to the largest local maximum.\nSimulations parameters are Lbox = 25, and ? = 10\n\n3. Results were averaged over 500 samples.\n\nthe average distance between aggregates is much larger than the average distance between monomers\nbelonging to the same aggregate; a more detailed study of the dependency on nm and the associated\ndiscretization effects will not be presented.\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe central problem studied here is the aggregation process of self-assembled scaffolds composed of\nchitosan particles linked together by cells, which we modeled with patchy particles. We started with\na simplified analysis, increasing the complexity stepwise: in chapter 1, we developed mean-field rate\nequations, while correlations between aggregates and patches were introduced in chapters 3 and 4, re-\nspectively. This gradual addition of features allowed isolated studies, resulting in a deeper understanding\nof how aggregation depends on each model (e.g. diffusion and concentration of species).\nCells adhere to one another to form tissues. In chapter 2, we compared two models for scaffold self-\nassembly focused on the dynamics of the cells, a first in which cells can form bonds to one another\nand a second where they cannot. It was found that suppressing this natural behavior resulted in larger,\nmore interconnected scaffolds that grew faster, which is of great practical interest. A large, mechanically\nresilient scaffold is required for the growth of healthy, macroscopic tissue. Furthermore, the quicker the\nscaffold assembles, the less likely it is for the assembly process to be effected by the natural bioactivity\nof the surrounding environment. Decreasing the formation time also increases the quality of life of the\ntreated patients and decreases medical expenses. For the remainder of the work, we focused on the model\nwith suppressed cell-cell bonds, for which we obtained multiple analytical and numerical results, such\nas the distribution of cells and the probability that a patch forms a cell-mediated bond to another patch.\nAn application of mean-field percolation theory bridges the gap between cell dynamics and scaffold\nstructure, predicting the formation of a gel. It was found that there is a value of the ratio of cells to\nparticles that optimizes scaffold growth.\nIn chapter 3, we introduced spatial correlations between aggregates through a lattice model, which we\nsolved numerically through a Monte Carlo algorithm. The lattice model considered aggregates to be\npoint-like and tree-like. We first studied the limit in which the diffusion coefficient of aggregates was\nindependent of their size. An interval of the ratio of cells to particles was found such that a giant aggregate\nthat includes all particles forms, in agreement with some simple calculations. We have also obtained the\nfunctional form of the size distribution of aggregates for some intervals of the ratio of cells to particles.\nWe then studied the limit in which there is a separation of timescales between the diffusion of free\nmonomers and the diffusion of aggregates of size two or more. It was found that the average size of\naggregates exhibits a bimodal shape as a function of the ratio of cells to particles with two optimal values\nin the asymptotic limit for a high value of the ratio of the diffusion coefficients of cells and particles.\nThis shape is preceded by a regime in which there is only one optimal value. The proposed mechanism\ninvolving the suppression of bonds between a portion of the monomers controlled by the occupied patch\ndistribution was verified with an analytical treatment and simulations.\nFinally, in chapter 4, we introduced aggregate shape and patch correlations in the limit where the\ntimescale of the diffusion of free monomers is separate from the diffusion of aggregates of size two\nor more. Simulations were performed with the more efficient kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. In the limit\nwhere the diffusion of cells is much faster than the diffusion of free monomers, a bimodal shape was\n\n45\n\n\n\nfound for the average size of aggregates, similarly to chapter 3, allowing us to conclude aggregate shape\nis not a key feature of the mechanism. It was found there is an optimum value of the ratio of cells to\nparticles for the fraction of loops which coincides with the value which maximizes scaffold growth, ex-\nplained through the distribution of occupied patches. It was further found that the maxima in the average\nsize of aggregates is not relevant for the fraction of loops. The possibility of indirectly tuning the fraction\nof loops through the ratio of cells to particles allows the tuning of the porosity and mechanical rigidity\nof the scaffold, for which there are strict requirements.\nWe studied the effect of the ratio of cell and monomer diffusion coefficients, having found that the\nmaxima in the average size of aggregates disappear when monomers are much faster than cells. The two\nmaxima disappear at different diffusion timescales due to two different mechanisms; one involving an\neffective reduction in the ratio of cells to particles and one involving a reduced rate of formation of bonds\nbetween cells and dimers. Both mechanisms result in an increased number of dimers in the asymptotic\nlimit. We concluded with a study of the density of monomers, where we show that both the values of\nthe ratio of cells to particles corresponding to the maxima and their height depend on the density of\nmonomers. We obtain a linear dependency of the height of the maxima valid for low densities, which is\nthe limit where the lattice model is most realistic.\nEven though the motivation for this study is in scaffold formation, these results are relevant for any\nsystem that exhibits aggregation mediated by a second species and it is of interest to practitioners to\nunderstand how experimental conditions and timescales can affect targeted structures. Extensions of\nthe work developed can include a study of the lattice model of chapter 4 for a generic relation between\naggregate size and diffusion coefficient. The diffusivity of clusters has been studied extensively both for\nliquids [26] and for adsorption on surfaces [27]. Furthermore, it is of interest to compare the results of\ncell-mediated aggregation with the work of P. Meakin, which contains numerous results involving the\nsize distribution in the simple one-species aggregation model [28]. Of high interest to the motivation is\nthe measurement of the porosity and mechanical strength of the self-assembled structures. Working in\ntandem with Molecular Dynamics studies, more realistic rates for bond breaking can be introduced such\nas to model the self-assembly of scaffolds in e.g. sheared fluids.\n\n46\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] C.
