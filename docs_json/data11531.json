In this context, it is \n\nwell-known that the numerical simulation of the forming processes assumed a vital role to \n\nface up these challenges. In particular, the introduction of new materials with higher \n\nstrength-to-weight ratio, and consequently reduced ductility, have sparked a growing interest \n\non the development of reliable computational tools, able to accurately predict the onset of \n\nfailure of ductile materials. \n\nThe main objective of this work is to evaluate the ability of a coupled micromechanical \n\ndamage model \u2013 the so-called CPB06 porous model, to describe the damage accumulation \n\nand, ultimately, the onset of failure of ductile materials exhibiting tension-compression \n\nasymmetry (SD effects). The main features of the CPB06 porous model are investigated and \n\nthe importance of the yield loci shape, through the role played by all stress invariants, on the \n\ndamage evolution are highlighted. \n\nWithin this framework, a detail sensitivity analysis of the damage model is firstly \n\nperformed based on the yield loci change of shape and size, when varying material and/or \n\ndamage parameters. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations of the \n\nyield surfaces are analysed. The influence of the stress state through the stress triaxiality, \n\nhydrostatic stress and the sign of the third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, \n\nparticularly for axisymmetric loadings, is also studied. Next, a numerical analysis is carried \n\nout, based on single-element computations under axisymmetric and hydrostatic stress states, \n\nobeying the isotropic form of the CPB06 porous model. The applicability and reliability of \n\nthe damage model is assessed by comparing the obtained results with the ones predicted by \n\ndocumented and well-accepted micromechanical finite element computations on three-\n\ndimensional unit cells. Additionally, the numerical tests are complemented with a brief \n\nsensitivity analysis regarding the matrix isotropic hardening law parameters. All numerical \n\nsimulations are performed with the in-house finite element solver DD3IMP. \n\nIt is shown that, under tensile axisymmetric loadings, the damage model predicts two \n\nvery distinct behaviours for the ductile damage evolution, whit regard to the sign of the third \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\niv  2018 \n\n \n\ndeviatoric stress invariant. For positive values of this invariant, the model is sensitive to the \n\nSD effects, in agreement with the behaviour predicted by the unit cell studies. Nonetheless, \n\nfor negative values of this invariant the damage model is shown to be insensitive to the SD \n\neffects, which contrasts with the behaviour predicted by the same studies. It is concluded \n\nthat the insensitivity to the SD effects for this particular stress state is due the homogeneous \n\ncharacteristics of the yield function, implying that the direction of the plastic strain \n\nincrement, and eventually the damage accumulation, are independent of the tension-\n\ncompression asymmetry displayed by the materials. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Ductile Damage, Porous Materials, Micromechanical Damage Model, \nCPB06, SD Effects, Stress Invariants.  \n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Resumo \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  v \n\n \n\n \n\nResumo \nA crescente complexidade dos componentes obtidos pelo processo de estampagem de \n\nchapas met\u00e1licas e a redu\u00e7\u00e3o dos ciclos de desenvolvimento de novos produtos colocaram \n\nnovos desafios a esta tecnologia de conforma\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste contexto, a simula\u00e7\u00e3o num\u00e9rica do \n\nprocesso de estampagem de chapas met\u00e1licas assumiu um papel not\u00f3rio para enfrentar estes \n\ndesafios. Em particular, a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de materiais com maior rela\u00e7\u00e3o resist\u00eancia-peso e, \n\nconsequentemente, menor ductilidade, despertou um interesse acrescido no desenvolvimento \n\nde ferramentas computacionais fi\u00e1veis e robustas, com capacidade para prever com precis\u00e3o \n\na ocorr\u00eancia da rotura de materiais d\u00facteis. \n\nO principal objetivo deste trabalho \u00e9 avaliar a capacidade de um modelo de dano \n\nmicromec\u00e2nico acoplado \u2013 o modelo poroso CPB06, para descrever a acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de dano \n\ne, eventualmente, o instante em que ocorre a falha mec\u00e2nica de materiais d\u00facteis que exibem \n\nassimetria tra\u00e7\u00e3o-compress\u00e3o (efeitos SD). As principais caracter\u00edsticas do modelo poroso \n\nCPB06 s\u00e3o investigadas e \u00e9 destacada a import\u00e2ncia da forma da superf\u00edcie de elasticidade, \n\natrav\u00e9s do papel desempenhado por todos os invariantes do tensor das tens\u00f5es, na evolu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo dano d\u00factil. \n\nNeste contexto, inicialmente \u00e9 realizada uma an\u00e1lise de sensibilidade ao modelo, com \n\nbase na altera\u00e7\u00e3o da forma e dimens\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie limite de elasticidade com a varia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos par\u00e2metros materiais e/ou de dano. S\u00e3o analisadas representa\u00e7\u00f5es tridimensionais e \n\nbidimensionais destas superf\u00edcies. A influ\u00eancia do estado de tens\u00e3o caracterizado atrav\u00e9s da \n\ntriaxialidade, da press\u00e3o hidrost\u00e1tica e do sinal do terceiro invariante do tensor desviador das \n\ntens\u00f5es, particularmente para carregamentos axissim\u00e9tricos, \u00e9 igualmente estudada. De \n\nseguida, \u00e9 realizada uma an\u00e1lise com base em simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas com um \u00fanico elemento \n\nfinito submetido a estados de tens\u00e3o axissim\u00e9tricos e hidrost\u00e1ticos, obedecendo \u00e0 forma \n\nisotr\u00f3pica do modelo poroso CPB06. A aplicabilidade e fiabilidade do modelo de dano s\u00e3o \n\navaliadas comparando os resultados obtidos com os previstos por estudos num\u00e9ricos em \n\nc\u00e9lulas unit\u00e1rias tridimensionais documentados na literatura. Os testes num\u00e9ricos s\u00e3o \n\ncomplementados por uma an\u00e1lise de sensibilidade em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos par\u00e2metros da lei de \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\nvi  2018 \n\n \n\nencruamento isotr\u00f3pico da matriz. Todas as simula\u00e7\u00f5es num\u00e9ricas s\u00e3o realizadas com o \n\nc\u00f3digo de elementos finitos acad\u00e9mico DD3IMP. \n\nA an\u00e1lise num\u00e9rica mostra que, em carregamentos axissim\u00e9tricos de tra\u00e7\u00e3o, o modelo \n\nde dano prev\u00ea dois comportamentos bastante distintos para a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do dano d\u00factil, em \n\nfun\u00e7\u00e3o do sinal do terceiro invariante do tensor desviador das tens\u00f5es. Para valores positivos \n\ndeste invariante, o modelo \u00e9 sens\u00edvel aos efeitos SD, o que est\u00e1 de acordo com o \n\ncomportamento previsto pelos estudos num\u00e9ricos realizados com c\u00e9lulas unit\u00e1rias. No \n\nentanto, para valores negativos deste invariante, o modelo de dano mostra-se insens\u00edvel aos \n\nefeitos SD, o que contrasta com o comportamento previsto pelos mesmos estudos. Conclui-\n\nse que a insensibilidade aos efeitos SD para este estado de tens\u00e3o \u00e9 devida \u00e0 homogeneidade \n\nda fun\u00e7\u00e3o que define a superf\u00edcie limite de elasticidade do crit\u00e9rio. Esta caracter\u00edstica \n\nmatem\u00e1tica da fun\u00e7\u00e3o implica que a dire\u00e7\u00e3o do incremento de deforma\u00e7\u00e3o pl\u00e1stica e, em \n\n\u00faltima an\u00e1lise, a acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de dano, sejam independentes da assimetria tra\u00e7\u00e3o-compress\u00e3o \n\nexibida pela matriz dos materiais porosos.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Dano D\u00factil, Material Poroso, Modelo de Dano Micromec\u00e2nico, \nCPB06, Efeitos SD, Invariantes do tensor das tens\u00f5es. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Contents \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  vii \n\n \n\n \n\nContents \nList of Figures ....................................................................................................................... ix \nList of Tables ...................................................................................................................... xiii \nList of Symbols and Acronyms ........................................................................................... xv \n\nSymbols ........................................................................................................................... xv \nAcronyms ....................................................................................................................... xix \n\n1.

Introduction \nThis chapter presents the motivation and a brief background on the framework of \n\nductile fracture prediction using the finite element method, highlighting the growing \n\nindustrial interest on damage modelling and its current challenges. The key objectives of the \n\nthesis and the outline of the text are also presented.  \n\n1.1. Motivation \nSheet metal forming is a process in which an initially planar geometry of a sheet metal, \n\nthe blank, is deformed to a desired shape applying external forces that cause plastic \n\ndeformation of the material. Being a near net-shape technology, this process is distinguished \n\nfrom other industrial manufacturing processes due to its high production rate, cost \n\neffectiveness, flexibility and enhanced mechanical properties of the final product. This \n\ntechnology is widely used in industries such as automotive, aeronautics, naval as well as in \n\ndomestic and decorative applications. \n\nDriven by the increasing complexity of the sheet metal forming processes and products \n\nas well as the global competition and the need for flexibility, due to the demands imposed \n\nby the market, the industry has demonstrated for the past decades a special interest in the \n\npotential of computational mechanics to solve its challenges (Yang, Ahn, Lee, Park, &amp; Kim, \n\n2002). One of the most popular numerical tools currently used is the Finite Element Analysis \n\n(FEA), which requires solving a set of algebraic equations that govern the mechanical \n\nbehaviour of a material for a discrete number of domains (Pack, 2017). \n\nIndeed, currently, the numerical simulation of sheet metal forming processes using the \n\nFEA assumes a vital role in the design stages of new products and tools. The ability to \n\nvirtually predict, at a preliminary project stage, possible forming defects in a product (e.g. \n\nsurface and dimensional, unsatisfactory final mechanical properties, rupture/fracture) allows \n\nthe minimization of the experimental based, and consequent costly and time-consuming, \n\ntrial-and-error steps. Therefore, in addition to the main role of validation and optimization \n\nof the forming process, the FEA leads to more flexible manufacturing processes, combining \n\nreduced time-to market for new products and lower costs involved in its development \u2013 an \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n2  2018 \n\n \n\nessential characteristic in competitive industries such as the automotive, aeronautical, \n\nmilitary, among others (Badreddine, Laberg\u00e8re, &amp; Saanouni, 2016). \n\nThe study of ductile fracture in the sheet forming process has gain increased \n\nimportance in recent years. This trend, especially noticeable in the automotive industry, is \n\nclosely related to the increasing usage of new materials with higher strength-to-weight ratio \n\nsuch as advanced high strength steels (AHSS). This family of steels, which includes dual \n\nphase steels (DP), transformation induced plasticity steels (TRIP) and martensitic steels \n\n(MS) (Keeler et al., 2014) have enhanced mechanical properties, namely yield stress and \n\ntensile strength, when compared to deep-drawing quality mild steels and conventional high-\n\nstrength steels (HSS). This newly introduced materials allow to produce lighter structures \n\nand components from thinner sections and/or thicknesses, while maintaining satisfactory \n\nstrength and stiffness, which ultimately results in a reduction of the overall structure mass, \n\na crucial step to meet the ever-stringent standards on passenger safety and gas emissions \n\n(Badreddine et al., 2016; Pack, 2017). However, as is well-known, the increased mechanical \n\nstrength of steels is usually accompanied by a reduction of their ductility. This phenomenon, \n\ncomplemented by the higher work hardening of AHSS, reduces the formability and \n\ncrashworthiness of the components, since necking and fracture occurs for plastic strains \n\nsmaller than the ones required by conventional steels. In fact, it has been experimentally \n\nverified that fracture can occur in AHSS without any evident sign of necking, which makes \n\nthe common usage of the well-known Forming Limit Diagrams (FLDs) unfeasible \n\n(Badreddine et al., 2016). Thus, it is of the utmost interest the development of reliable \n\nnumerical tools that accurately describe internal damaging and failure of ductile materials, \n\neither by necking onset or premature ductile fracture. As an example, Figure 1.1 shows the \n\napplication of a damage model within a FEA of an engineering component. \n\n \n\n \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 1.1. FEA of a cross-shape component with damage prediction (a) Equivalent plastic strain and \ninternal damage contours; (b) Stress triaxiality distribution before failure (Amaral et al., 2016). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  3 \n\n \n\nTo achieve this, the damage models must be able to capture the characteristic load-\n\npath dependent failure behaviour of ductile materials and provide reliable prediction of the \n\nstress and strain histories \u2013 crucial for predicting the onset of fracture (Roll, 2008). \n\nSimultaneously, such models should not present an overly complex formulation, which \n\nwould lead to increased difficulties in their numerical implementation stage and in the \n\ncalibration of the model parameters through experimental tests. In short, such tools must \n\nobtain accurate results in a reasonable computational time and be practical enough to be \n\napplicable to a fast-moving industry environment (Pack, 2017). \n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that damage models can play a very important role in \n\nother technological areas. The widely used sheet metal blanking process, a manufacturing \n\ntechnology in which material separation is due to ductile fracture, can greatly benefit from \n\nimproved damage criteria. Studies shown that sheet metal blanking simulations using \n\ndamage models result in an improved prediction of the punch force and quality of the final \n\nproduct (Yoon, Stewart, &amp; Cazacu, 2011). Moreover, the damage modelling and fracture \n\nprediction allows the design of lighter and safer structures through accurate crash \n\nsimulations, which can also take into account the parts manufacturing process, and \n\nultimately contribute to improve the crashworthiness of vehicles and aircrafts (Dunand, \n\n2013). \n\n1.2. A brief background on damage modelling for ductile \nfracture prediction \n\nBefore briefly discuss the existing alternatives for damage modelling, it is of all \n\ninterest to clarify the meaning of the commonly mentioned terms damage and ductile \n\nfracture. The term ductile fracture is used to describe the rupture of a material that \n\nexperiences large plastic deformation, exhibiting high ductility in the region where structural \n\nfailure occurs. Ductile fracture is a physical process that results from the accumulation of \n\nplastic damage and leads to the formation and propagation of cracks in metals (Marcadet, \n\n2015; Xue, 2007). In its turn, damage can be understood as the physical process of \n\nprogressive deterioration of the material. At the microscopic level, damage is related to the \n\nmechanism of nucleation, growth and coalescence of micro-cracks and micro-cavities, \n\nevidenced by experimental observations. Macroscopically, damage translates into a decrease \n\nof the material stiffness, strength and a reduction of the remaining ductility. Damage is an \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n4  2018 \n\n \n\ninternal variable that usually cannot be measured directly or easily quantified, unlike the \n\nmaterial\u2019s ductility or its fracture strain. Therefore, damage models are proposed to link field \n\nvariables (e.g. strain tensor, stress tensor, stress triaxiality) to the progressive deterioration \n\ntowards fracture, i.e. the damage evolution (Xue, 2007). This connection can be numerically \n\nsimulated using either the so-called uncoupled or coupled damage models. \n\nThe uncoupled models assume the damage process as being independent of the \n\nmaterial plastic behaviour, i.e. the plastic properties of the material do not change with the \n\ndamage accumulation. This approach consists in carrying out a conventional FEA simulation \n\nand evaluate damage exclusively as a post-processing step of the finite element solution \n\n(Badreddine et al., 2016; Kiran &amp; Khandelwal, 2014). Within this framework, damage \n\naccumulation is formulated empirically or semi-empirically through a separate scalar \n\nvariable D, with the general criterion: \n\n \np\nf p p\n\nc0\n( , ) ,D f d D\n\n?\n?= ?? ? ?\n\n (1.1) \n\nwhere P?  is the equivalent plastic strain, Pf?  is the critical value of equivalent plastic strain \n\nat fracture for a given loading path, ?  is the Cauchy stress tensor and p?  is the plastic strain \n\ntensor. The integrand p( , ),f ? ?  is the so-called weighting function of damage and represents \n\na general function of the field variables, e.g. stress and strain tensors, stress triaxiality, etc. \n\nThe weighting function is either chosen empirically or inspired by micromechanical results \n\nand can also account for thermal and strain rate effects. According to these models, fracture \n\nis considered to occur when  the damage variable D, exceeds the critical damage value, cD  \n\n(Li, Fu, Lu, &amp; Yang, 2011; Xue, 2007). Several uncoupled criteria, i.e. weighting functions \n\nhave been develop. The reader is referred to the work of Ayada (1987); Cockcroft &amp; Latham \n\n(1968); McClintock (1968); Rice &amp; Tracey (1969); Wierzbicki, Bao, Lee, &amp; Bai, (2005), \n\namong many others. \n\nUncoupled models often fail to predict the ductile fracture due to the over \n\nsimplification of the mechanical behaviour of the material. Nevertheless, this approach can \n\nbe used as a fast procedure for early development stages due to its simpler formulation, \n\nnumeric implementation and parameters calibration (Teixeira, 2010; Xue, Pontin, Zok, &amp; \n\nHutchinson, 2010). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  5 \n\n \n\nThe coupled models approach incorporate damage accumulation in the constitutive \n\nequations. In other words, the plastic properties of the material are in fact considered as a \n\nfunction of the accumulated damage. Generally, coupled models can be classified in two \n\nmain categories: micromechanical-based (or physical-based) and damage-based (or \n\nphenomenological) models (Kiran &amp; Khandelwal, 2014). \n\nThe micro-mechanical damage models treat the materials as a cluster of \n\ninhomogeneous cells. It is well-known that microstructure of metals is characterized by the \n\npresence of multiphase materials, such as precipitates, second phase particles, impurities and \n\nvoids. The void distribution is a function of pre-existing voids (e.g. manufacturing defects) \n\nand of the nucleation by decohesion of second-phase particles and/or by particle fracture. \n\nThe void grow results from the plastic deformation of the surrounding matrix material. \n\nMicromechanical-based damage models take advantage of the intimate relationship between \n\nmaterial porosity and ductile failure: the ability to accurately describe the evolution of the \n\nvoid distribution in a ductile metal allows to accurately predict the failure of the material \n\n(Stewart, 2009). Due to computational constraints, the approach of modelling each of the \n\nmicro-voids in the material is not practical at this time. Thus, instead of explicitly tracking \n\nthe microscopic evolution of each void, the mechanical behaviour of the micro-voids is \n\nincorporated into macroscopic, or average, properties (such as macroscopic stress, strain, \n\nyielding, etc.) (Stewart, 2009). In this analysis, a void is modelled surrounded by undamaged \n\nmaterial (the matrix material, which obeys conventional continuum mechanics) in a \n\nrepresentative volume element (RVE) also known as unit cell (Xue, 2007). The macroscopic \n\nbehaviour of the macroscopic material is then obtained through a homogenization procedure, \n\nwhere an analytic expression is derived for the plastic potential (and, thus, for the yield \n\ncriterion, when assuming associated plasticity) (Stewart, 2009). Due to the enormous \n\ncombination of the possible size, shape, orientation and spacing of the voids and of the RVE \n\ngeometry, simplifications and assumptions have to be made to make the mathematical \n\nproblem of void evolution tractable (Xue, 2007). The most widely used plastic potential for \n\nporous solids is related with the original work developed by Gurson (1977). In Gurson-like \n\nmicromechanics-based criteria, the behaviour of a void-containing solid is described by the \n\npressure-sensitive plastic flow, and the internal damage variable is employed in the \n\nconstitutive equations, interacting with the other state variables. In these criteria, the internal \n\ndamage variable is the void volume fraction, defined as the ratio between the accumulated \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n6  2018 \n\n \n\nvolume of individual voids and the total volume of the RVE (Li &amp; Karr, 2009). The fracture \n\nis considered to occur then the void volume fraction reaches a critical value. The Gurson \n\nmodel and its extensions will be further explored and discussed in more detail in following \n\nchapters. \n\nThe damage-based models framework, or phenomenological approach, is based on the \n\nclassical Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) theory proposed by Lemaitre (1984). In \n\nthis framework, the material degradation resulting from the mechanism of nucleation, \n\ngrowth and coalescence of micro-voids is described using a purely phenomenological model \n\nderived from the first and second principles of thermodynamics for continuous media \n\n(Badreddine et al., 2016; Dunand, 2013). CDM-based criteria introduce a macroscopic \n\ndamage indicator in the constitutive relationships as an internal variable to describe the \n\ndamage evolution and progressive degradation of the material (Li et al., 2011). The internal \n\ndamage state variable affects both the elastic behaviour and the plastic flow, through the so-\n\ncalled effective stress, based either on the strain equivalence principle or the energy \n\nequivalence principle (Chaboche, Boudifa, &amp; Saanouni, 2006). In opposition to micro-\n\nmechanical models, the constitutive and damage models of the material is based on the \n\nexternally observed behaviour of the material, as the growth of individual void and their \n\ninteractions are depicted in a phenomenologically aggregative way (Xue, 2007). Compared \n\nto Gurson-like micromechanical models, CDM models are relatively simpler to apply since, \n\ndue to its phenomenological nature, the identification of the material parameters is more \n\nintuitive and typically fewer measurements are involved (Li et al., 2011). \n\nWhen compared to uncoupled damage models, coupled models represent a sounder \n\nphysical background of the micromechanical fracture and, therefore, typically allow to \n\nobtain more reliable results in the ductile fracture prediction. However, the coupled models \n\nare more difficult to implement in an FEA code and usually require a greater computational \n\neffort.  \n\nThe selection of the damage model to apply in a numerical simulation is a non-trivial \n\nissue. The applicability and reliability of a model must be confronted with its computational \n\ncost and calibration difficulty (Wierzbicki et al., 2005). The inappropriate application of \n\ndamage models may result in misleading ductile fracture predictions, which has been a \n\nproblematic issue in industrial applications of both the coupled and uncoupled alternatives \n\n(Li et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Introduction \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  7 \n\n \n\n1.3. Objectives of the work \n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of a coupled micromechanical damage \n\nmodel \u2013 the so-called CPB06 porous model, to describe the damage accumulation and, \n\nultimately, final failure of ductile materials exhibiting tension-compression asymmetry. The \n\npredictive ability of the isotropic form of the abovementioned constitutive damage model is \n\nassessed through elementary numerical simulations, under axisymmetric and hydrostatic \n\nstress states. A qualitative comparison between the numerical predictions obtained by the \n\ndamage model and by micromechanical finite element computations on three-dimensional \n\nunit cells, documented in the literature, is performed. In order to support and substantiate the \n\nnumerical results, a sensitivity analysis of the damage model yield criterion parameters is \n\nfirstly carried out based on the yield loci change of shape and size, when varying material \n\nand/or damage parameters. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations of \n\nthe yield surfaces are analysed. These are used to analyse the influence of the stress state \n\nthrough the stress triaxiality, hydrostatic stress and the sign of third invariant of the \n\ndeviatoric stress tensor, particularly for axisymmetric loadings. The damage model response \n\nthrough elementary numerical tests is complemented with a brief sensitivity analysis \n\nregarding the matrix isotropic hardening law parameters. All numerical simulations were \n\nperformed with the in-house finite element solver DD3IMP, specifically developed for \n\nsimulating sheet metal forming processes (Menezes &amp; Teodosiu, 2000). \n\nIn summary, the present work intends to provide a contribution to the evaluation of the \n\napplicability and reliability of the CPB06 coupled damage model on the ductile fracture \n\nprediction, investigating its main features and highlighting the importance of the yield loci \n\nshape, through the role played by all stress invariants, on the damage evolution and \n\nultimately, on the onset of failure. \n\n1.4. Layout of the thesis \nThis section presents a summary of the contents covered in this work. The thesis \n\ncomprises of two main parts, organized into six chapters. The former corresponds to the \n\nliterature review and contains Chapter 2 and Chapter 3; the latter covers the investigations \n\nconducted within the framework of this study, corresponding to Chapter 4, Chapter 5 and \n\nChapter 6. Following the general introduction and motivation presented in this first chapter, \n\nthe layout of the thesis is as follows. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n8  2018 \n\n \n\nChapter 2 sets out the basic concepts describing the physical mechanisms of the ductile \n\ncrack formation. Some well-known coupled micromechanical damage models and relevant \n\nextensions are briefly presented, discussion their advantages and possible drawbacks. The \n\ndescription of the stress state in the fracture mechanics framework is also presented. \n\nChapter 3 presents the anisotropic and isotropic version of the Cazacu, Plunkett &amp; \n\nBarlat (2006) yield criterion, used to describe the tension-compression asymmetry displayed \n\nby the matrix material. Next, the Stewart &amp; Cazacu's (2011) plastic potential for random \n\ndistributed spherical voids is introduced. Both anisotropic and isotropic versions of this \n\ncoupled damage model are analysed. The expressions of the damage model resulting for the \n\nparticular case of axisymmetric stress states are briefly discussed. \n\nChapter 4 is devoted to the sensitivity analysis of the Cazacu &amp; Stewart's (2009) \n\nisotropic damage model parameters, based on three-dimensional representations of the yield \n\nsurfaces and corresponding two-dimensional projections on the deviatoric plane and on the \n\naxisymmetric plane. \n\nChapter 5 describes the numerical analyses conducted in order to assess the ability of \n\nthe damage model to describe the plastic flow of the matrix and the accumulated damage in \n\nporous solids exhibiting tension\u2013compression asymmetry. The numerical model and the \n\nmethodology adopted in the analysis are briefly discussed. A detailed analysis of the results \n\nis performed and the main findings of this study are presented.

Coupled Micromechanical-Based Damage Models \nThis chapter provides an overview of the general concepts governing the physical \n\nmechanism of the ductile crack formation, emphasizing the complexity and the consequent \n\ndifficulties associated with the description of the ductile fracture process. Following this \n\nliterature review, the description of the stress state in the fracture mechanics framework is \n\npresented. Finally, the original Gurson (1977) micromechanical damage model and some of \n\nits extensions are presented, discussing the main features and drawbacks of this approach. \n\n2.1. Physical mechanisms of the ductile crack formation \n\nAs outlined in the introductory chapter, ductile fracture can be described as a three \n\nstage process: nucleation, growth and coalescence of micro-voids (see e.g. McClintock \n\n(1968) and Rousselier (1987)). In this section each stage of this physical mechanism will be \n\nreviewed in detail. \n\nThe void distribution in a material originates from pre-existing voids or from \n\nnucleation at second-phase particles, either by matrix-particle decohesion or by particle \n\ncracking (e.g. inclusions, impurities). It is generally observed that voids nucleate preferably \n\nin larger second-phase particles due to higher local stress fields generated by the presence of \n\nlarger rigid inclusions, when the matrix undergoes plastic deformation, and due to the \n\nincreased number and size of geometrical defects at this larger particles, leading to easier \n\nmicro-crack formation in the particles. Void nucleation could also occur in shear bands (Bao, \n\n2003). Following nucleation, voids will grow and eventually link. \n\nIt is well-known that the stress triaxiality \u2013 defined by the ratio between the mean \n\nstress and the equivalent stress \u2013 is the most important parameter governing ductile crack \n\nformation (Bao, 2003). The mean stress (or hydrostatic stress), which has little or no \n\ninfluence on the overall plastic deformation in the absence of damage, i.e. in fully dense \n\nmaterials, exhibits a dramatic effect on the ductile fracture mechanism of porous materials, \n\nparticularly on the void growth and coalescence stages (Nahshon &amp; Hutchinson, 2008). \n\nAccording to McClintock (1968) the size, shape and spacing of the voids depends on the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n10  2018 \n\n \n\nentire stress and strain history. Indeed, the physical mechanism of void growth and final \n\nlinkage is governed by the microstructure of the material and loading conditions. Under \n\nshear dominated loads, i.e. low stress triaxiality, the voids undergo a rotation and a change \n\nof shape, which makes them lose their initially spherical shape. Since rotation of voids does \n\nnot change the void volume fraction, the macroscopic dilation of the voids is minimal. In \n\nthis case, there is a relatively small dilatational growth (or change of volume) and the ductile \n\nfracture is mainly due to large \u201cdeviatoric\u201d or shape changing void growth (Bao, 2003). On \n\nthe other hand, under high stress triaxiality, the change of volume dominates the contribution \n\nto void growth over the shape changing effect and, therefore, voids retain their initial shape \n\n(Besson, 2010; Rice &amp; Tracey, 1969). \n\nIn addition to the different processes of void nucleation and void growth previously \n\nmentioned, different processes of void linkage, also known as void coalescence, have been \n\nexperimentally observed. When the voids grow so large that they begin to interact with each \n\nother, the deformation becomes highly localized (Xue, 2007). Void linkage can occur \n\nthrough three phenomena: internal necking of the matrix between voids, simple touching of \n\ntwo voids (void impingement) and due to the so-called void sheet mechanism (Bao, 2003). \n\nThese ductile failure micro-mechanisms lead to the formation of macroscopic cracks and, \n\nultimately, the macroscopic failure of the material. Figure 2.1 highlights the internal necking \n\nand the void sheet mechanisms \u2013 the more commonly observed coalescence modes. Failure \n\nby internal necking of the matrix occurs mainly at high stress triaxiality and is due to inter-\n\nvoid ligament necks of large primary voids. \n\n \n        (a)   (b) \n\nFigure 2.1. Two ductile failure micro-mechanisms (after Weck et al., 2006): (a) inter-void ligament necking; \n(b) void sheeting mechanism.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Coupled Micromechanical-Based Damage Models \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  11 \n\n \n\nWhen a material contains several populations of inclusions corresponding to different \n\nlength scales, failure by void sheeting can also occur. In this void coalescence mode, also \n\nknown as shear coalescence, shear banding occurs at the scale of the voids. In this \n\nmechanism, active at low stress triaxiality, the linkage between primary voids and micro-\n\ncrack propagation is accelerated due to the nucleation of secondary voids at highly \n\nconcentrated shear bands induced by the stress concentration effect at the ends of the micro-\n\ncrack and by shear dominated loadings (Besson, 2010). This plastic shear localization \n\nweakens the total aggregate of material and promotes inter-void ligaments of smaller, \n\nelongated and rotated voids. It should be noted that \"shear coalescence\" is just the name for \n\nthis type of mechanism and it does not mean that this type of micro-mechanical failure is \n\nexclusively due to shear loadings. \n\nAt intermediate stress triaxialities there is a combined effect of volumetric and shape \n\nchanges of the voids as both internal necking and void sheet mechanisms are active. In other \n\nwords, the intermediate stress triaxiality range is a transition range (Bao, 2003). \n\nExperimental observations on steels and aluminium alloys shown that the void sheet \n\nmechanism can cause inter-void ligament failure before void touching takes place, (which \n\nwould require a distribution of larger voids) (Hammi &amp; Horstemeyer, 2007). Void \n\ncoalescence modelling has received less attention in the literature than void nucleation and \n\nvoid growth mainly because of the lack of definition and difficulty in quantifying this \n\nbehaviour. In fact, although there are well-established micromechanical-based damage \n\nmodels that consider void coalescence due to the internal necking of the matrix (e.g. \n\nMcClintock (1968) and Rice &amp; Tracey (1969)) and due to simple void contact (e.g. Gurson \n\n(1977)), no good void sheet mechanism modelling has been developed (Bao, 2003). So far, \n\nvoid shearing damage criteria have been mostly modelled through heuristic approaches, \n\nbased on the know-how rather than deep scientific analysis (Li et al., 2011). \n\nDespite the great relevance of the stress triaxiality on ductile fracture mechanics, FEA \n\non unit cells (e.g. Cazacu &amp; Stewart (2009) and Alves, Revil-Baudard &amp; Cazacu (2014)) as \n\nwell as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based approaches (e.g. Lebensohn &amp; Cazacu (2012)) \n\nhave shown that the stress triaxiality by itself can be insufficient to characterize the yielding \n\nof porous materials. In these studies was shown that, for the same triaxiality, the yielding \n\nand the rate of void growth depend not only on the first and second invariants of the stress \n\nand deviatoric stress tensors, respectively, but also on the sign of the third invariant of the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n12  2018 \n\n \n\nstress deviator \u2013 a relationship often referred in the literature as \u201cLode angle dependence\u201d \n\n(Xue, 2007). In the past decade, experimental data has supported this evidence, recognizing \n\nand highlighting the role played by all stress invariants in the yielding of porous materials \n\nand, consequently, in the ductile fracture prediction (Alves et al., 2014; Malcher, 2012). \n\nThe ductile fracture phenomena briefly reviewed in this section show that appropriate \n\nmodelling of these physical mechanisms is by no means trivial, especially when volumetric \n\nand shear effects are combined through complex strain paths (Malcher, 2012). Observations \n\nof the physical process of ductile fracture have allowed the development of damage models \n\nand procedures for fitting the models parameters, in order to perform numerical simulations. \n\nNowadays, recent developments of X-ray tomography allows to gather real-time 3D data of \n\nthe evolution of damage (e.g. void shape, rotation, growth, linkage, etc.). Using this method, \n\nerror on damage quantification induced by conventional surface preparation techniques can \n\nbe avoided (Babout, Maire, Buffi\u00e8re, &amp; Fougeres, 2001), leading to a better understanding \n\nof the process and enhanced damage criteria developments (Besson, 2010). \n\n2.2. Description of the stress state \n\nA stress state is fully defined by the six independent components of the Cauchy stress \n\ntensor. Regarding the study of ductile fracture mechanics, the stress state is usually described \n\nby two dimensionless parameters: the stress triaxiality, T?  and the normalized Lode angle, \n\n.??  Letting ?  be the macroscopic principal stress tensor with the diagonal components 1 ,?\n\n2?  and 3?  ordered such that 1 2 3? ? ? ? ? , the mean stress, m?  can be defined as: \n\n ( ) ( )m 1 1 2 3\n1 1 1\n\ntr ,\n3 3 3\n\nI ?? = = = ? + ? + ??\n \n\n(2.1) \n\nwhere tr(? ) denotes the trace of a tensor and 1I\n?  is the first invariant of the stress tensor. The \n\nmacroscopic deviatoric stress tensor, '?  is given by: \n\n \n1 m\n\nm 2 m\n\n3 m\n\n0 0\n0 0 ,\n0 0\n\n? ??? ?\n? ?= ?? = ? ??? ?\n? ? ?? ?? ?\n\n'? ? ?\n \n\n(2.2) \n\nwith I being the second-order identity tensor. Therefore, the second and third deviatoric \n\nstress invariants, respectively 2J\n?  and 3J\n\n?  can be written as: \n\n ( )' 2 ' 2 ' 22 1 2 3\n1\n\n,\n2\n\nJ ? = ? + ? + ?\n \n\n(2.3) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Coupled Micromechanical-Based Damage Models \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  13 \n\n \n\n ' ' '3 1 2 3 .J\n? = ? ? ?  (2.4) \n\nThe von Mises equivalent stress, e?  can be represented as a function of the second deviatoric \n\nstress invariant, 2J\n?  as: \n\n e 23 ,J\n?? =  (2.5) \n\nThus, the stress triaxiality, T?  is defined as the ratio of the mean stress and equivalent von \n\nMises stress, i.e.:  \n\n m\ne\n\n,T?\n?\n\n=\n?\n\n \n(2.6) \n\nwith .T??? ? ? ?  Note that for purely deviatoric loadings 1( 0),I\n? =  results  while for purely \n\nhydrostatic loadings at tension or compression 2( 0),J\n? =  results that T? ? ?  or ,T? ? ??  \n\nrespectively. \n\nThe so-called normalized third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, ??  lies in the \n\nrange 1 1??? ? ?  and characterizes the position of the second principal macroscopic stress, \n\n2?  with respect to the maximum and minimum principal stresses, 1?  and 3?

( 1)?? = ?  to a \n\nuniaxial compression loading. In the same spirit as 3J\n? , this parameter can be normalized, \n\nresulting in the so-called normalized Lode angle or Lode angle parameter, ??  given in this \n\ncase by: \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n14  2018 \n\n \n\n \n6\n\n,\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n? =\n \n\n(2.10) \n\nor, alternatively, as a function of the normalized third invariant of the stress deviator, ??  as: \n\n ( ) ( )\n2 2\n\n1 arccos arcsin .? ? ?\n? ?? ? ?\n\n? ?\n= ? =? ?\n? ?\n\n \n(2.11) \n\nSimilarly to the parameter ?? , the Lode angle parameter also varies in the range 1 1.??? ? ?   \n\nA stress state represented in a three-dimensional Cartesian system 1 2 3( , , )? ? ?  can be \n\ntranslated in to an equivalent cylindrical coordinate system, with coordinates e m( , , ).??? ?  \n\nThis transformation is exemplified in Figure 2.2 (a), underlining the hydrostatic axis \n\ndirection and the definition of the ?-plane1. This cylindrical coordinate system is also \n\nreferred as the Haigh\u2013Westergaard coordinates. In the ?-plane, the Lode angle is defined as \n\nthe smallest angle formed between the pure shear line segment and the projection of the \n\nactual stress tensor on the deviatoric plane, as shown in Figure 2.2 (b) (Malcher, 2012). \n\nTherefore, the Lode angle can be understood as a quantification of the proximity (or \n\nremoteness) of the current stress state relative to the pure-shear stress state, i.e. the position \n\nof the second principal macroscopic stress in the interval defined by the maximum and \n\nminimum principal stresses: 1 2 3 .? ? ? ? ?  \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 2.2.

Indeed, the direction of the vector defined by the principal stress \n\ntensor can be unequivocally expressed by these pair of parameters. Hence, throughout the \n\nthesis, the term \u201cstress state\u201d will refer to these widely used adimensional parameters in the \n\nfracture mechanics framework. Some of the stress states with great importance for the sheet \n\nmetal forming process are mentioned bellow: \n\n? Pure-shear ( 0,  0T ?? ?= = );   \n\n? Uniaxial tension ( 1 / 3,  1T ?? ?= = ); \n\n? Uniaxial compression ( 1 / 3,  1T ?? ?= ? = ? ); \n\n? Plane strain tension ( 1 / 3,  0T ?? ?= = ); \n\n? Equibiaxial tension ( 2 / 3,  1T ?? ?= = ? ); \n\n? Equibiaxial compression ( 2 / 3,  1T ?? ?= ? = ). \n\n2.3. Gurson-like micromechanical damage models \n\nThe first micromechanical ductile damage models where developed by McClintock \n\n(1968) and Rice &amp; Tracey (1969) to describe the growth of isolated cylindrical or spherical \n\nvoids in a rigid perfectly plastic matrix. These pioneer uncoupled criteria outlined the \n\ncombined role of the stress triaxiality and the plastic strain on the void growth. Being \n\nuncoupled models, these prior studies did not consider the effects of the void growth on the \n\nmaterial behaviour, i.e. neglected the softening effects (Besson, 2010). This problem was \n\nfirstly addressed by Gurson (1977), which developed a coupled micromechanical-based \n\nmodel by introducing a new yield function which strongly links the plastic behaviour with \n\nthe damage accumulation (Chaboche et al., 2006). Gurson developed analytic yield criteria \n\nfor ductile materials containing either spherical or cylindrical voids. To obtain the plastic \n\npotentials, and thus, the yield criteria, Gurson performed an upper bound limit load analysis \n\non the RVEs (spherical void within a spherical shell RVE or a cylindrical void within a \n\ncylindrical tube RVE), assuming a rigid perfectly plastic matrix material (undamaged/void \n\nfree material) obeying the classic pressure-insensitive von Mises criterion (Besson, 2010). \n\nGurson\u2019s criteria are an upper bound of the exact plastic potential, since the minimization of \n\nthe plastic energy was done for a specific velocity field compatible with uniform strain rate \n\nboundary conditions, rather than for the complete set of kinematically admissible velocity \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n16  2018 \n\n \n\nfields (Stewart, 2009). The mathematical details of the analysis are rather complex \n\n(Chaboche et al., 2006). When assuming an associated flow rule, the result is a plastic \n\npressure-sensitive yield surface which takes into account the damage accumulation, given \n\nfor spherical voids as: \n\n \n2\n\nS 2e m\nG\n\nY Y\n\n3\n2 cosh 1 0,\n\n2\nf f?\n\n? ?\n? ? ? ?? ?\n\n= + ? ? =? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ?\n\n \n(2.12) \n\nand for cylindrical voids as: \n\n \n2\n\n??C 2e\nG eqv\n\nY Y\n\n3\n2 cosh 1 0,\n\n2\nC f f?\n\n? ?\n\n? ??? ??\n= + ? ? =? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?\n\n \n(2.13) \n\nwhere \n\n ( )\n26\n\neqv\n1 3 24  for plane strain,\n\n1                           for axisymmetry.\n\nf f\nC\n\n? + +?\n= ?\n??\n\n \n(2.14) \n\nIn the previous expressions, e?  is the macroscopic von Mises equivalent stress, m?  is the \n\nmacroscopic mean stress or hydrostatic stress, Y?  is the yield stress of the undamaged \n\nmaterial, ???  is the sum of the in-plane stresses (e.g. ?? 11 22? = ? + ?  if the 3-direction is the \n\nout-of-plane direction) and  f  is the void volume fraction (or porosity), which quantifies the \n\ncurrent damage and is defined by the ratio of the void volume to the total volume of the \n\nRVE. Note that, unlike von Mises yield criterion, Gurson's criteria depend not only on the \n\nsecond invariant of the stress deviator, but also on the pressure (or the mean stress), i.e. on \n\nthe first invariant of the stress tensor. However, in the absence of voids ( 0f = ), these criteria \n\nreduce to that of the matrix, i.e. the von Mises yield surface. Gurson\u2019s spherical void criterion \n\nis considered more often in the literature than the cylindrical void criterion. Even so, the \n\nlatter can be applied to certain problems, for example plane stress analysis of sheet metal \n\n(Stewart, 2009). \n\nThe matrix material is described by a convex yield function in the stress space. The \n\nmacroscopic plastic strain rate tensor, pD  is determined through the normality rule, \n\nassuming an associated flow rule, as: \n\n p ,\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=\n?\n\nD\n?\n\n?\n\n \n(2.15) \n\nwhere ?  is the macroscopic Cauchy stress tensor and 0? ??  the rate of the plastic multiplier. \nAssuming the equivalence of microscopic and macroscopic inelastic work (i.e. equivalence \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Coupled Micromechanical-Based Damage Models \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  17 \n\n \n\nof the rate of plastic work), the rate of the microscopic/local effective plastic strain, pM??  is \n\nobtained as: \n\n ( )p pM M : 1 ,f ? ?= ?? D ?  (2.16) \nwhere M?  is the flow stress of the matrix, following a given hardening law. Combining the \n\nabove expressions results: \n\n \n( )\n\np\nM\n\nM\n\n:\n.\n\n1 f\n\n?\n\n? ?\n?\n\n?\n?=\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n??\n\n \n(2.17) \n\nThe void volume fraction rate, f?  evolves both from the nucleation and the growth of \n\nexisting voids such that: \n\n growth nucleation ,f f f= +? ? ?\n (2.18) \n\nwhere the rate of change due to the growth of existing voids, growthf?  is obtained from the \n\nplastic incompressibility of the matrix material, i.e. mass conservation principle as: \n\n ( ) ( )p pgrowth 0 01 : 1 ,   with  ( ) ,kkf f f D f t f= ? = ? =D I?  (2.19) \nwhere \u201c:\u201d denotes the tensor double contraction. Thus, PkkD  is the trace of the macroscopic \n\nplastic strain rate tensor, pD  which represents the macroscopic plastic strain rate. In the \n\nprevious expression, 0f  corresponds to the initial void volume fraction at the time instant \n\n0 .t  Note that the evolution law for the damage variable f, is entirely determined by the \n\ndefinition of the yield surface (Besson, 2010). Indeed, in Gurson-like criteria, the physical \n\nmechanisms of ductile fracture (void nucleation, growth and coalescence) is modelled by \n\nexplicitly monitoring the void volume fraction, which accounts for the reduction of the load-\n\nbearing area and subsequent softening effect. \n\nThe void volume fraction rate of change due to nucleation, nucleationf?  was one of the first \n\nextensions proposed to the original Gurson model. Void nucleation can be modelled as \n\nstress-controlled, as discussed in Argon, Im &amp; Safoglu (1975) or strain-controlled as \n\nsuggested by Gurson (1975) and is generally written as: \n\n pnucleation N M N mf A B?= + ?? ? ?  (2.20) \n\nBoth plastic strain controlled nucleation and mean stress controlled nucleation are frequently \n\nconsidered in a statistical way, following a normal distribution as suggested by Chu &amp; \n\nNeedleman (1980).

These parameters can be thought of as an adjustment of the \n\nyield surface to account for the influence of neighbouring voids, hence designated as void \n\ninteraction parameters (Kiran &amp; Khandelwal, 2014; Stewart, 2009).

In order to model the complete loss of \n\nload carrying capacity at a realistic level of the void volume fraction, Tvergaard &amp; \n\nNeedleman (1984) further modified Gurson's spherical yield criterion to account for the \n\nonset of void coalescence leading to final material fracture. This model is often referred to \n\nas the Gurson\u2013Tvergaard\u2013Needleman (GTN) model. The GTN criterion is given by: \n\n ( )\n2\n\n2* *e m\n1 2 3\n\nM M\n\n3\n2 cosh 1 0,\n\n2\nq f q q f?\n\n? ?\n? ? ? ?? ?\n\n= + ? ? =? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ?\n\n \n(2.24) \n\nwhere *f  is the so-called effective void volume fraction.

Effective void volume fraction concept introduced by Tvergaard and Needleman (1984);  \n\nGTN model damage evolution.  \n\nAs discussed in the previous section, the coalescence phenomenon is a highly complex \n\nphysical mechanism, that even today lacks theoretical definition and is challenging to \n\nquantify. The effective void volume fraction concept introduced by Tvergaard &amp; Needleman \n\n(1984) to formulate the GTN model accounts for coalescence in a rather basic but efficient \n\nway (Besson, 2010). When properly calibrated for a specific material, Gurson-like models \n\nhave shown considerable potential for characterizing damage evolution and fracture \n\nprediction (Xue et al., 2010). Despite the success of Gurson-type criteria on many \n\napplications, there are some drawbacks associated with these models: \n\ni. No void shearing mechanism is considered: the presented Gurson models are unable \n\nto predict fracture under shear-dominated loading conditions (low stress triaxiality), \n\nwhere the void growth mechanism is inactive and void sheeting dominates. Indeed, \n\nunder pure shear loadings, the GTN model will fail to predict any void growth and \n\nthus, predict the ductile failure, if N Ff f&lt; (the nucleation potential does not exceed \n\nthe void volume fraction at failure). Gurson-like models were conceived to be \n\napplied at high stress triaxiality loadings, where pressure sensitivity (the mean \n\nstress) dominates the fracture phenomenon. The application of these models at low \n\nstress triaxialities should be used with caution; \n\nii. The damage accumulation in ductile materials is a more complex phenomenon than \n\nsolely track the evolution of the void volume fraction, e.g. the presence of a volume-\n\nless micro crack inherently creates damage to the material by introducing loss of \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Coupled Micromechanical-Based Damage Models \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  21 \n\n \n\nload carrying area (Xue, 2007). Furthermore, the actual distribution of void \n\nnucleation, void size, shape, orientation and spacing have to be treated in a \n\nstochastic way since the distribution of such parameters are often unknown; \n\niii. Due to the large number of material parameters, the calibration of the GTN model \n\nis a challenging procedure that still remains open (Bao, 2003). Moreover, those \n\nparameters are strongly coupled and it was proven that a non-unique solution can \n\nexist if no physical significance is added to these parameters (e.g. ductile fracture \n\ninitiation can either be simulated as early nucleation of a small volume of voids or \n\ndelayed nucleation of a large volume of voids (Kiran &amp; Khandelwal, 2014)); \n\niv. The matrix material obeys the classical isotropic von Mises yield criterion and the \n\nvoids retain their spherical shape. However, in some applications such as in cold \n\nrolled metal sheets, the micro-voids that form within a loaded material are \n\nellipsoidal rather than spherical, due to the influence of the asymmetrical loadings \n\nand/or an anisotropic microstructure (Stewart, 2009). In coupled damage criteria, \n\npoor plasticity modelling leads to poor damage modelling. By neglecting the \n\nanisotropic behaviour of the material matrix, original Gurson-like criteria are \n\nunable to reliably predict the fracture on strongly anisotropic ductile materials; \n\nv. In Gurson's (1977) limit-analysis for the hollow sphere the matrix plastic dissipation \n\nwas approximated with a function that depended only on the radial coordinate, r,  \n\ni.e. the polar coordinate, ? was neglected. This approximation amounts to \n\ndiscarding any combined effects of shear and mean stress on the yielding of the \n\nporous solid. As a consequence, the original Gurson-type criteria are insensitive to \n\nthe third-stress invariant, 3J\n?  and depend only on the stress triaxiality, T?  which, as \n\ndiscussed previously, can be insufficient to correctly characterize yielding, even for \n\nhigh triaxiality loadings, see e.g. Alves, Revil-Baudard &amp; Cazacu (2014). \n\n2.3.1. Calibration of the model parameters \nThe material parameters identification can be performed through: (i) microscopic \n\nmeasurements; (ii) macroscopic measurements; and (iii) a hybrid experimental-numerical \n\napproach. The microscopic approach allows the direct evaluation of the initial void volume \n\nfraction, 0f  and of the volume fraction of void nucleating particles, Nf  through image \n\nanalysis of the undamaged material with 3D X-ray micro-tomography or in-situ neutron \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n22  2018 \n\n \n\ndiffraction. Additionally, it can be used to quantify the ductile fracture parameters, cf  and \n\nF .f  This approach also allows the qualitative measurement of other variables such as, void \n\nspacing, size and distribution as well as fracture propagation and final crack aspect. The \n\nmacroscopic approach uses experimental tests (e.g. tensile tests on various notched \n\nspecimens to obtain different stress triaxialities, punch tests, butterfly tests, etc.) and Digital \n\nImage Correlation (DIC) measurements to determine the load-displacement curves, \n\ndisplacement or strain at the onset of coalescence and at fracture, and the crack appearance \n\non the specimen thought image analysis. The hybrid experimental-numerical approach \n\ncombines finite element simulations with experimental data to determine the value of the \n\nmaterial parameters that lead to the best fittings between the numerical and experimental \n\nload-displacement curves. In most investigations, the calibration procedure starts by fixing \n\nthe void interaction parameters to  1 1.5,q =  2 1q =  and \n2\n\n3 1q q= , as recommended by \n\nTvergaard (1982), as well as fixing the standard deviation of the void nucleation strain to \n\nN 0.1s =  \u2013 a common value in several studies, regardless of the material considered (see \n\nBenseddiq &amp; Imad (2008)). The remaining parameters, void nucleation parameters, N N( , ),f ?  \n\nfor strain-controlled nucleation and the ductile fracture parameters, c F( , )f f  are calibrated \n\nfollowing a mono-parametric analysis, in order to determine the numerical values that yields \n\nan overall good agreement with experimental results. Due to the strong coupling between \n\nthe material parameters, different experiments should be performed to calibrate each set of \n\nparameters. It should be noted that each calibration step is not independent from all \n\nsubsequent steps and therefore a calibration procedure must be repeated iteratively until \n\nsatisfactory results are achieved (Dunand, 2013). \n\nBesides the GTN model specific parameters, the hardening law of the matrix material \n\nhas also to be defined for the complete description of the coupled damage model. The \n\nhardening law parameters are chosen to fit the stress-strain curve of the actual porous \n\nmaterial obtained from quasi-static uniaxial tensile tests of un-notched specimens up to \n\nnecking. When the initial porosity, 0f  is very small when compared with the nucleated void \n\nvolume fraction, Nf  the tensile behaviour of the porous material remains almost unaffected \n\nby the growth of pre-existing voids for strains lower than the nucleation strain, N?  thus the \n\nmatrix degradation can be neglected. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Coupled Micromechanical-Based Damage Models \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  23 \n\n \n\nOne can conclude that the GTN\u2019s parameter identification is a challenging issue that \n\nhas strongly limited the model application in the industry environment. Although there have \n\nbeen a large amount of work aimed at the development of calibration procedures, to the \n\nauthor knowledge there is still no well-stablished method or standard calibration procedure. \n\nFor more information concerning the GTN model parameters calibration, the reader is \n\nreferred to the work of Benseddiq &amp; Imad (2008), Xue et al. (2010), Dunand &amp; Mohr (2011), \n\nLi et al. (2011) and Kiran &amp; Khandelwal (2014). \n\n2.3.2. Modifications and extensions of Gurson\u2019s analysis \nIn addition to the extensions to the original Gurson (1977) model proposed by Chu &amp; \n\nNeedleman (1980) to account for void nucleation, and by Tvergaard &amp; Needleman (1984) \n\nto account for the loss of load-carrying capacity associated with void coalescence, many \n\nother works have modified and extended Gurson\u2019s analysis to more complex materials, as \n\nwell as to more complex void shapes and distributions. The reader is referred to the work of: \n\nGologanu, Leblond &amp; Devaux (1993) to account for ellipsoidal voids (prolate and oblate) \n\nrather than spherical voids; the works of Liao, Pan &amp; Tang (1997) and Benzerga &amp; Besson \n\n(2001) which address anisotropy using Hill's 1948 yield criterion for transversely isotropic \n\nmetal sheets under plane stress conditions and for orthotropic porous metals, respectively; \n\nand the extended GTN model proposed by Besson &amp; Guillemer-Neel (2003) to include \n\nmixed isotropic and kinematic hardening within a thermodynamic framework. Other very \n\nrelevant extensions were proposed by Xue (2008) and Nahshon &amp; Hutchinson (2008) to \n\nintroduce a dependency of the damage evolution on the third-stress invariant (i.e. Lode angle \n\ndependence), and thus deal with the material deterioration under shear-dominated loads due \n\nto void distortion and void sheet coalescence in an heuristic way. Moreover, Cazacu et al. \n\n(2013) developed an analytic criterion to include the effect of the third invariant of the \n\ndeviatoric stress tensor on the yielding of the porous material governed by a von Mises yield \n\ncriterion. This thesis will particularly study the modifications proposed by Stewart (2009) to \n\naccount for materials that have different yield strengths in tension versus compression, the \n\nso-called tension-compression asymmetry. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n24  2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n Analytic Yield Criteria for Porous Solids Exhibiting Tension\u2013Compression Asymmetry \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  25 \n\n \n\n3. Analytic Yield Criteria for Porous Solids Exhibiting \nTension\u2013Compression Asymmetry \n\nIt is well established that metallic sheets usually exhibit plastic anisotropy as a result \n\nof the forming processes. The importance of the plastic anisotropy has been recognized and \n\nthere has been a global effort to model its effects on the mechanical behaviour of the \n\nmaterials, through the development of macroscopic plasticity models. However, until recent \n\nyears the strength differential (SD) effects have been neglected (Barros, Alves, Oliveira, &amp; \n\nMenezes, 2016). The SD effects, or tension-compression asymmetry is a shear related \n\nphenomenon that results from single crystal plastic deformation, either due to the activation \n\nof mechanical twinning or due to slip that does not obey the well-known Schmid law, i.e. \n\nnon-Schmid type slip (Hosford &amp; Allen, 1973). Unlike the conventional (Schmid type) slip \n\ndeformation which is a reversible shear mechanism, twinning is an irreversible and \n\ndirectional shear mechanism, i.e. shear can promote twinning in one direction but not in the \n\nopposite direction. The twinning effect becomes more prominent when increasing the strain \n\nrate (Barros et al., 2016; Stewart, 2009). \n\nThe SD effects are more pronounced in metals with hexagonal closed packed (HCP) \n\nstructure (e.g. ?-titanium, magnesium, zirconium, etc.). However, materials with cubic \n\ncrystal structure such as high strength steels (HSS), molybdenum and aluminium alloys can \n\nalso exhibit some tension\u2013compression asymmetry in yielding, although in the absence of \n\nvoids they are pressure-insensitive (Benzerga, Besson, &amp; Pineau, 2004b; Stewart, 2009). \n\nA fundamental issue that arises is how the SD effects of the matrix material impacts \n\nthe damage accumulation, i.e. the void growth stage of the ductile failure mechanism; and, \n\nas a consequence, the overall ductility of the voided metallic polycrystals. To account for \n\nthe SD effects in a incompressible matrix, Stewart &amp; Cazacu (2011) recently developed a \n\nmacroscopic anisotropic yield criterion for porous aggregates that is sensitive to all stress \n\ninvariants. For this purpose, in their analysis, the matrix plastic behaviour was described by \n\nthe Cazacu, Plunkett &amp; Barlat (2006) orthotropic yield criterion \u2013 often referred as the \n\nCPB06 yield criterion, which will be preliminary presented in the next subsection.

Although it is pressure-insensitive, i.e. neglects the effects of the first stress \n\ninvariant, 1I\n? , it accounts for the SD effects, a phenomenon that occurs in HSS (and \n\nAHSS), the same family of materials that sparked growing interest in developing \n\nreliable damage models; \n\nii. If a material displays SD effects ( 0),k ?  the plastic flow depends on the sign and \n\nordering of all principal values of the macroscopic stress deviator, '?  hence it \n\ndepends on the third-invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, 3J\n? , which, as \n\ndiscussed, can have a great impact on damage accumulation and ductile fracture; \n\niii. In the isotropic case all the yield criterion parameters, T( , , , ) 0k a? ? =\n'?  have a \n\nclear physical meaning, namely the uniaxial yield stress in tension, T?  and the \n\nmaterial parameter k, which is intimately related to specific single-crystal plastic \n\ndeformation mechanisms; \n\niv.

An yield criterion for anisotropic porous aggregates \ncontaining spherical voids and exhibiting SD effects \n\nAs mentioned in the previous chapters, much work has been done to extend the original \n\nGurson (1977) damage model to include the anisotropy effects of the matrix. It is worth \n\nnoting the contribution of: Liao, Pan &amp; Tang (1997) that modified Gurson's (1977) \n\ncylindrical void criterion to account for transverse isotropy using the Hill'48 yield criterion; \n\nthe contribution of Benzerga &amp; Besson (2001), which extended Gurson's (1977) spherical \n\ncriterion for orthotropic materials also using the Hill\u201948 criterion; and the work of Gologanu, \n\nLeblond &amp; Devaux (1993) that developed an macroscopic yield criterion for prolate \n\nellipsoidal voids to account for void shape effects, which later was further extended by \n\nBenzerga, Jacques Besson &amp; Pineau (2004) to merge Gologanu et al. (1993) elliptical void \n\nshape model with the orthotropy modelling earlier proposed in Benzerga &amp; Besson (2001). \n\nAlthough these studies account for the anisotropy effect, they all neglect (or fail to recognize) \n\nthe tension-compression asymmetry behaviour in yielding that some materials can display. \n\nIn order to account for the SD effects on yielding of porous media, Stewart &amp; Cazacu \n\n(2011) recently performed a rigorous mathematical upscaling analysis, based on the \n\nkinematic non-linear homogenization approach of Hill (1967) and Mandel (1972), to derive \n\na closed-form macroscopic yield criterion for anisotropic porous aggregates containing \n\nrandomly distributed spherical voids (Lebensohn &amp; Cazacu, 2012; Revil-Baudard et al., \n\n2016). The tension\u2013compression asymmetry associated with directional shear mechanisms \n\nat the single crystal level are accounted by the CPB06 anisotropic yield criterion. The plastic \n\npotential derived by Stewart &amp; Cazacu (2011), including Tvergaard (1981) additional fitting \n\nparameters, iq  (see Equation (2.23)), has the following expression: \n\n ( )\n2\n\nT 2e 2 m\n1 1 3T T\n\n1 1\n\n3\u02c6 , , , 2 cosh 1 0,\nq\n\nk f q f q f\nh\n\n? ?\n? ?\n? ? ? ?? ?\n\n= + ? ? =? ? ? ?\n? ?? ?\n\n?\n?  \n\n(3.12) \n\nwhere e??  is the macroscopic equivalent stress associated with the CPB06 anisotropic \n\ncriterion with 2,a =  k is the CPB06\u2019s material parameter describing the SD effects, T1?  is \n\nthe uniaxial yield strength along an axis of orthotropy of the matrix material (e.g. rolling \n\ndirection), and f  is the void volume fraction (or effective void volume fraction, *f  if \n\nassuming Tvergaard &amp; Needleman's (1984) extension (see Equation (2.25)).

This factor \n\ndepends on the sign of the macroscopic mean stress, m?  and on the anisotropy coefficients \n\nof the fourth-order tensor C (see Equation (3.4)) and can be expressed, following Lebensohn \n\n&amp; Cazacu (2012), as: \n\n ( )1 2\n\u02c6\n\n4 6 ,\n5\nn\n\nh t t= +\n \n\n(3.13) \n\nwhere the constant n?  accounts for the matrix SD effects and is expressed as: \n\n \nm2 2\n\nm2 2\n\n1 3\n    if 0,\n\n\u02c6 3 2 3\n\u02c6\n\n1 3\n    if 0,\n\n\u02c6 3 2 3\n\nm k k\nn\n\nm k k\n\n? ? ?\n?&lt;? ?? ? +? ? ?\n\n= ?\n? ?? ? ?? ?? + +? ??\n\n \n\n(3.14) \n\nfor 2,a =  with m?  being the effective stress constant given by Equation (3.5).

The expressions of the \n\ncomponents of B in terms of the linear transformed anisotropy coefficients ijL , with\n\n, 1,..., 6i j = , are resumed in Annex B.  \n\nSince the yield surface proposed by Stewart &amp; Cazacu (2011) depends on all stress \n\ninvariants, the criterion accounts for the influence of both the direction and the sense of \n\nloading on the dilatational plastic response of the material (Lebensohn &amp; Cazacu, 2012). In \n\naddition to yielding of the porous aggregate, the combined effects of matrix anisotropy and \n\ntension\u2013compression asymmetry are also accounted on the porosity evolution. In fact, as \n\nstated in Equation (2.19), the porosity evolution due to void growth, growthf?  is obtained from \n\nthe mass conservation principle.

In the previous expression it is clearly seen that the porosity \n\nevolution depends on the parameter h which, by its turn, depends on the strength\u2013differential \n\nparameter k and on the anisotropy coefficients.  \n\nContrary to the original Gurson-type criteria, the yield function is no longer symmetric \n\nwith respect to the transformations ' 'm m( , ) ( , )? ? ? ?? ?  and \n' '\n\nm m( , ) ( , ).? ? ??? ?

In other words, if the matrix exhibits SD effects the yield surface is not \n\nsymmetric with respect to the plane m 0.? =  According to Stewart &amp; Cazacu's (2011) \n\ncriterion, for tensile hydrostatic loading, yielding of the porous material occurs when \n\nm Yp?\n+? =  with: \n\n \n2\n\nT 1 3\nY 1\n\n2 1\n\n11\u02c6 cosh ,\n3 2\n\nq f\np h\n\nq q f\n?+ + ?\n\n? ?+\n= ? ?\n\n? ?\n\n \n(3.19) \n\nwhereas, for compressive hydrostatic loading, yielding occurs when m Yp?\n?? =  with: \n\n \n2\n\nT 1 3\nY 1\n\n2 1\n\n11\u02c6 cosh .\n3 2\n\nq f\np h\n\nq q f\n?? ? ?\n\n? ?+\n= ? ? ?\n\n? ?\n\n \n(3.20) \n\nNote that, as shown in Equations (3.13) and (3.14), h can be defined by branches, such as: \n\n m\nm\n\n    if 0,\n    if 0.\n\nh\nh\n\nh\n\n?\n\n+\n\n? ?&lt;?\n= ?\n\n? ???\n\n \n(3.21) \n\nIf 23 1 ,q q=  as Tvergaard (1981) recommended, the previous expressions resume to: \n\n ( )TY 1 1\n2\n\n1\u02c6 ln ,\n3\n\np h q f\nq\n?+ += ?\n\n \n(3.22) \n\n ( )TY 1 1\n2\n\n1\u02c6 ln .\n3\n\np h q f\nq\n?? ?= +\n\n \n(3.23) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n Analytic Yield Criteria for Porous Solids Exhibiting Tension\u2013Compression Asymmetry \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  33 \n\n \n\nAs discussed previously, if the matrix is isotropic but displays SD effects ( 0),k ?  the \n\nanisotropy tensor C reduces to the fourth-order identity tensor, I and the CPB06 yield \n\ncriterion takes its isotropic form, i.e. the matrix uniaxial yield stress in tension, T?  is equal \n\nin all directions and there is a single T C/? ?  ratio. Thus, Stewart &amp; Cazacu's (2011) \n\nanisotropic yield criterion (Equation (3.12)) reduces to its isotropic form \u2013 the Cazacu &amp; \n\nStewart's (2009) criterion, given as: \n\n ( )\n2\n\n' 2e 2 m\nT 1 s 3\n\nT T\n\n3\n, , , 2 cosh 1 0,\n\n2\nq\n\nk f q f z q f? ?\n? ?\n? ? ? ?? ?\n\n= + ? ? =? ? ? ?\n? ?? ?\n\n?\n?  \n\n(3.24) \n\nwhere e??  is the CPB06 isotropic form of the macroscopic equivalent stress. The parameter \n\nsz  controls the damage evolution, in the same spirit as the anisotropic parameter h in \n\nEquation (3.12), but it depends only on the strength-differential parameter k, such that: \n\n \nm\n\n2\ns T\n\nm2isot\nC\n\n 1                                     if 0;  \n2\n\n3 2 3\n    if 0,\n\n3 2 3\nz k k\n\nh\nk k\n\n?\n?\n\n?&lt;?\n?\n\n= = ? ?? + +\n= ? ?? ?? ? +? ??\n\n \n\n(3.25) \n\nwhere \nisot\n\nh  is the isotropic form of h. Again, because Cazacu &amp; Stewart's (2009) yield \n\ncriterion depends on all principal values of the deviatoric stress tensor and on the sign of the \n\napplied mean stress through the parameter sz , it does not have the symmetry properties of \n\nthe Gurson's (1977) criterion. In the isotropic case yielding occurs at purely hydrostatic \n\ntensile loading when m Yp?\n+? =  for: \n\n ( ) ( )Y T 1 C 1\n2 2\n\n1 2\nln ln ,\n\n3 3\np h q f q f\n\nq q\n? ?+ += ? = ?\n\n \n(3.26) \n\nwhereas, for compressive hydrostatic loading, the model predicts that yielding occurs when \n\nm Yp?\n?? =  for: \n\n ( ) ( )Y T 1 T 1\n2 2\n\n1 2\nln ln .\n\n3 3\np h q f q f\n\nq q\n? ?? ?= =\n\n \n(3.27) \n\nNote that, according to the two previous expressions, yielding at tensile hydrostatic loading \n\nis exclusively a function of the yield strength in compression, C?  and, in opposition, yielding \n\nat compressive hydrostatic loading is a function of the yield strength in tension, T? . This \n\ncounter-intuitive result is related to the exact (analytical) solution for a hollow sphere loaded \n\nhydrostatically and obeying the CPB06 isotropic yield criterion (e.g. see Cazacu &amp; Stewart \n\n(2009)) and it was further validated by unit cell calculations (Yoon, et al., 2011). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n34  2018 \n\n \n\nIf the matrix material presents no tension\u2013compression asymmetry, i.e. T C( ),? ?=  \n\nthen 0,k =  thus s 1,z =  3 / 2m =  and the Cazacu &amp; Stewart's (2009) criterion (Equation \n\n(3.24)) reduces to the GTN yield criterion.

CPB06 porous model under macroscopic axisymmetric \nstress states \n\nIn order to further investigate the effects of the third-invariant, 3 ,J\n?  and of the stress \n\ntriaxiality, T?  on yielding of the porous aggregate and, ultimately, on the damage \n\naccumulation, this thesis will focus particularly on the study of macroscopic axisymmetric \n\nloadings. Thus, in an introductory way, this section briefly presents the expressions that \n\ncharacterize this type of stress state. Letting 1 2 3( , , )e e e  be the reference frame associated \n\nwith the axes of orthotropy, an axisymmetric loading about the 3e  axis is characterized such \n\nthat 11 22 ,? = ?  i.e. only two principal macroscopic stresses are independent: \n\n ( ) ( )11 1 1 2 2 33 3 3 ,= ? ? + ? + ? ?? e e e e e e  (3.28) \nwith ?  denoting the macroscopic stress tensor, 11?  the imposed macroscopic lateral stress \n\nand 33?  the macroscopic axial stress.

These stress states can be distinguish by the sign of 3J\n?  (see Equation (3.31)), or \n\nanalogously, by the two possible values of the Lode angle parameter, 1.?? = \u00b1  Defining ?  \n\nas a prescribed constant to ensure a specified value for the stress triaxiality ratio, such that: \n\n 33\n11\n\n,?\n?\n\n=\n?\n\n \n(3.33) \n\nthe two possible axisymmetric stress states can be distinguished as: \n\ni. 33 11 1,?? > ? ? >  which corresponds to 3 0J\n? >  and 1;?? =  \n\nii. 33 11 1,?? &lt;? ? &lt; which corresponds to 3 0J\n? &lt; and 1.?? =  \n\nIt can be shown that for loadings characterized by 33 11 ,? > ?  two principal values of the \n\ndeviator stress tensor '?  are compressive (negative) but the maximum principal value is \ntensile (positive).

Knowing the relationship between the von Mises and the CPB06 \n\nequivalent stresses, it is possible to quantify the effect of the sign of 3J\n?  for purely deviatoric \n\nloadings m( 0)? = . Indeed, substituting Equation (3.35) in the Stewart &amp; Cazacu (2011) \n\ncriterion (Equation (3.12)), the porous anisotropic material is predicted to yield at purely \n\ndeviatoric loading when: \n\n \n\n( )\n( )\n\n( )\n( )\n\n1\n3\n\n2\n3\n\ne\n\n1 1\n3\n\n2\n3\n\n1\n   if  0;\n\n\u02c6 2 3 2 3\n\n1\n   if  0,\n\n\u02c6 2 3 2 3\n\nT\n\nq f\nJ\n\nm k k\n\nq f\nJ\n\nm k k\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n? ?\n>?\n\n? +?? ?\n= ?\n\n??&lt;?\n+ +??\n\n \n\n(3.37) \n\nif 23 1 ,q q= as recommended in Tvergaard (1981). In order to better understand this result, \n\nthe same expressions are now expressed under isotropic conditions. In the isotropic case, the \n\neffective stress constant m?  takes its isotropic form, m (Equation (3.9)) and the anisotropy \n\ntensor C reduces to the fourth-order identity tensor, I.

Sensitivity Analysis of the CPB06 Porous Model \nYield Surfaces \n\nIn this chapter a sensitivity analysis of the Cazacu &amp; Stewart's (2009) isotropic model \n\nparameters, from now on referred as the CPB06 porous model, is performed. To this end, \n\nthe yield loci change of shape and size with the variation of the material and damage \n\nparameters is assessed. The analysis is performed both on three-dimensional (3D) yield \n\nsurfaces and the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) projections on the deviatoric plane \n\nand/or on the axisymmetric plane, i.e. the plane defined by the condition 1 2 .? = ?  Moreover, \n\nthe influence of the stress state through the stress triaxiality, hydrostatic stress and the sign \n\nof 3J\n? , particularly for axisymmetric loadings, is further analysed and discussed. \n\nRegarding the strategy adopted for the determination of the yield loci, a Fortran.90 \n\nprogram was developed, based on several subroutines of DD3MAT in-house code \u2013 \n\n(developed to perform the identification of the yield criteria parameters). The developed \n\nprogram allows to numerically determine a set of data points in the three-dimensional space, \n\ni.e. a point cloud, which satisfy the Stewart &amp; Cazacu (2011) orthotropic yield criterion (see \n\nEquation (3.12)). In order to convert the point cloud into 3D surfaces, a MATLAB\u00ae program \n\nwas implemented. Within this code, the surfaces are constructed based on a triangulation \n\nmethod. The scatter points of the 2D projections are obtained from subset solutions of the \n\noriginal numerical point cloud. All the figures presented in this chapter were constructed \n\nusing MATLAB\u00ae programs. \n\n4.1. Influence of the void volume fraction \n\nAs stated in previous chapters, micromechanical damage models, such as the CPB06 \n\nporous model, are established through the intimate relationship between material porosity \n\nand the ductile failure mechanism, relying on the ability to describe the evolution of voids \n\nto accurately predict the failure of the material. Being the single internal damage variable, it \n\nis of the utmost interest to evaluate the influence of the void volume fraction, f  on the yield \n\nsurface locus, and thus quantify the softening effect of the material. In order to accomplish \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n40  2018 \n\n \n\nthis, several yield surfaces where generated for three virtual materials displaying different \n\ntension\u2013compression asymmetries (as in Subsection 3.1), rewritten here for the reader\u2019s \n\nconvenience: \n\n? 0k =  T C( / 1),? ? =  which corresponds to a von Mises material;  \n\n? 0.3098k =  T C( / 1.21),? ? =  corresponding to a fully-dense isotropic BCC material; \n\n? 0.3098k = ? T C( / 0.83),? ? =  corresponding to a fully-dense isotropic FCC material.  \n\nThus, throughout the chapter, in addition to the main objective of the sensitivity analysis, a \n\nparallel study will be carried out regarding the influence of the SD effects on the yield loci. \n\nThe influence of the void volume fraction, f  on the yield surface is evaluated through \n\nseveral three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) yield surface representations \u2013 \n\nnamely ?-plane representations and axisymmetric plane projections of the 3D yield locus. \n\n4.1.1. Three-dimensional yield surface representations \nIn order to facilitate the analysis of the yield surfaces, the usual three-dimensional \n\nCartesian system 1 2 3( , , )? ? ?  is transformed into a cylindrical coordinate system normal to \n\nthe ?-plane, i.e. referred to the hydrostatic axis. As an example, the mentioned coordinate \n\nsystem transformation is illustrated in Figure 4.1. The closed-form surface of Figure 4.1 (a) \n\ncorresponds to the solution of the yield criterion, ' T( , , , ) 0k f? ? =?  (Equation (3.24)) in the \n\n1 2 3( , , )? ? ?  space). The surface represented in Figure 4.1 (b) is obtained by multiplying each \n\npoint by the appropriate orthogonal rotation matrix, R, namely:  \n\n \n\n1/ 2 1/ 2 0\n\n1/ 6 1/ 6 2/ 6 .\n\n1/ 3 1/ 3 1/ 3\n\n? ??\n? ?\n\n= ? ?? ?\n? ?\n? ?? ?\n\nR\n\n \n\n(4.1) \n\nNote that the cylindrical coordinate system adopted in Figure 4.1 (b) allows a more compact \n\nsolution and an improved perception of the surface contours and dimension thorough the \n\nhydrostatic axis, m T( / ).??  Moreover, as a result of the coordinate system transformation, it \n\nis not possible to associate a clear physical meaning to the perpendicular axes defined on the \n\nbottom plane of Figure 4.1 (b), which contains some ?-plane projections. \n\nFigure 4.2 to Figure 4.4 show three-dimensional representations of the CPB06 porous \n\nmodel for different values of the void volume fraction, considering the three values of the \n\nmaterial parameter k, which describes the SD effects.

This \n\nlimit solution of the porous model is illustrated in Figure 4.2. It can be verified that, being \n\npressure-insensitive, that is, by neglecting the effects of the first invariant of the stress tensor, \n\n1 ,I\n?  the radial and angular coordinates of the yield surfaces are independent of the height \n\ncoordinate \u2013 the mean stress, m .?  Indeed, the surfaces will not converge at any point, being \n\ninfinite along the hydrostatic axis. This behaviour demonstrates the incompressible nature \n\nof the matrix material. Additionally, note that when the matrix material presents no tension\u2013\n\ncompression asymmetry (see Figure 4.2 (a)), the CPB06 porous model further reduces to the \n\nvon Mises yield criterion, which is 3J\n? - independent, i.e. the yield locus in the ?-plane is a \n\ncircle. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n42  2018 \n\n \n\n   \n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFigure 4.2. 3D representation of the CPB06 porous model for a void-free material (f = 0): (a) no tension-\ncompression asymmetry (k = 0); (b) yield strength in tension greater than in compression (k = 0.3098);  \n\n(c) yield strength in tension lower than in compression (k = \u20130.3098). \n\n   \n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFigure 4.3. 3D representation of the CPB06 porous model for a material with f = 0.010: (a) no tension-\ncompression asymmetry (k = 0); (b) yield strength in tension greater than in compression (k = 0.3098);  \n\n(c) yield strength in tension lower than in compression (k = \u20130.3098). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSensitivity Analysis of the CPB06 Porous Model Yield Surfaces  \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  43 \n\n \n\n   \n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFigure 4.4. 3D representation of the CPB06 porous model for a material with f = 0.100: (a) no tension-\ncompression asymmetry (k = 0); (b) yield strength in tension greater than in compression (k = 0.3098);  \n\n(c) yield strength in tension lower than in compression (k = \u20130.3098).  \n\n Figure 4.3 shows the effect of the presence of voids in the homogenized material \n\n( 0.01).f =  As soon as porosity arises, the yield surfaces become finite along the hydrostatic \n\naxis, i.e. the porous aggregate is considered to be compressible, recovering its sensitivity to \n\n1 .I\n?  Moreover, if SD effects are present, the yield loci is no longer symmetric with respect \n\nto the middle plane, defined by m 0.? =  Since the three materials are assumed to have the \n\nsame yield strength in tension, T? , yielding at compressive hydrostatic loading occurs in all \n\ncases at the same distance from the m 0? =  plane, as stated in Equation (3.27). This \n\nreinforces the idea that the SD effects are irrelevant in the definition of the lower vertex of \n\nthe yield surfaces. However, since the materials have different yield strengths in \n\ncompression, C? , yielding at tensile hydrostatic loading occurs for three different values of \n\nmean stress, Yp?\n+  (see Equation (3.26)). Note the curious result that higher values of the yield \n\nstrength in compression lead to higher values for the yield hydrostatic stress in tension, i.e. \n\nthe tensile hydrostatic limit occurs for an higher value of m T/ .??  Further analysing the plots, \n\nit can be concluded that the yield surfaces present their maximum dimension along the \n\ndeviatoric plane at m 0.? =  By moving away from this plane, i.e. as the mean stress increases \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n44  2018 \n\n \n\ntowards either tensile or compressive hydrostatic limits (the surface vertices), the surfaces \n\nshrink in the deviatoric plane. Note that, despite changing its size, the shape of the yield \n\nlocus in the deviatoric plane is governed by the tension-compression asymmetry of the \n\nmatrix, through the sign and magnitude of the material parameter k. Furthermore, the \n\nvariation of the size of the surface in the ?-plane with the distance to the plane m 0? =  does \n\nnot appear to be linear. This subject will be recovered in a following subsection where a \n\nsensitivity analysis will be carried out by varying the mean stress, m .?  Lastly, it should be \n\nmentioned that, when no tension-compression asymmetry is displayed, the matrix obeys the \n\nclassical von Mises yield criterion, hence the surface plotted in Figure 4.3 (a) matches to the \n\nwell-known GTN model, given by Equation (2.24). \n\nFigure 4.4 shows the yield surfaces of the same porous aggregates as in Figure 4.3, but \n\nwith a ten times higher porosity, 0.10.f =  The reduction of the size of the surfaces is \n\nevident, especially the distance between the vertices along the hydrostatic axis. It seems that \n\nthe increase of the void volume fraction changes the proportions of the yield locus to account \n\nfor the reduction of the load-bearing area and the subsequent softening effect. \n\n4.1.2. Two-dimensional yield surface representations \nThe surfaces represented in the three-dimensional space allowed to study the global \n\nbehaviour of the porous aggregates when varying the porosity. A complementary analysis is \n\nnow carried out through two-dimensional projections to further understand the influence of \n\nthe void volume fraction,  f  on the definition of the yield locus. In particular, some deviatoric \n\n?-plane projections are presented in order to evaluate the reduction of size of the yield locus \n\non this plane. Additionally, axisymmetric projections are carry out to compare the reduction \n\nof the yield surface dimensions along the hydrostatic axis versus along the deviatoric plane, \n\ni.e. to evaluate the yield surface proportions during the damage accumulation.  \n\nFigure 4.5 illustrates ?-plane representations for the CPB06 porous model ductile \n\ncriterion ' T( , , , ) 0k f? ? =?  (see Equation (3.24)) for the three materials considered in this \n\nstudy, for a fixed hydrostatic stress, m 0.? =  Regardless of the shape of the yield loci, which \n\nis ruled by the SD effects, it is shown that the surfaces shrink in the deviatoric plane as the \n\nporosity increases. Note that, if the material exhibits tension-compression asymmetry, the \n\nreduction of the radial coordinate is not equal in all directions, i.e. the softening depends on \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSensitivity Analysis of the CPB06 Porous Model Yield Surfaces  \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  45 \n\n \n\nthe angular coordinate \u2013 otherwise the surfaces would change their original shape. However, \n\nthe successive decrements of the radial coordinate, resulting from the increase of porosity, \n\nhave the same value along the principal axes for all three materials. Furthermore, along the \n\nprincipal axes, the reduction of the radial coordinate seems to vary linearly with the porosity. \n\nIn order to confirm this observation, Equation (3.40), derived for axisymmetric loadings in \n\nthe previous chapter, is recovered. Trivially, the derivative of e T/??  in order to the void \n\nvolume fraction is constant. On other hand, note that for purely deviatoric loadings m( 0)? =  \n\nwith 3 0J\n? >  the principal axis 3 T/??  of Figure 4.5 is collinear with e T/ ,??  given in \n\nEquation (3.40). Moreover, due to the isotropy assumption, the distance relative to the \n\nhydrostatic axis (i.e. the radius) of the yield surface points contained in the deviatoric plane \n\nat m 0? =  and intercepted by the principal axes T/i ??  with 1, 2, 3i =  is the same in the three \n\ndirections.

The radial coordinate of the yield locus intercepted \n\nby the principal axes is a linear function of the void volume fraction,  f  and it is independent \n\nof the SD effects. Although not represented in Figure 4.5, as a limit case, the surfaces would \n\nconverge into a single point when the void volume fraction reached its ultimate value, i.e. \n\n11/f q?  or  \n* *\n\nU 11/f f q? =  if the effective void volume fraction concept proposed by \nTvergaard &amp; Needleman (1984) is considered. \n\nThe previous analysis was performed for a single mean stress value, m 0.? =  A \n\nfundamental question that arises is how the increasing porosity of the aggregate effects the \n\nentire range of the yield surface along the hydrostatic axis. For this purpose, the projection \n\nof the yield locus ' T( , , , ) 0k f? ? =? , given in Equation (3.24), on the axisymmetric plane  \n\n11 22( )? = ?  is also constructed. This projection is obtained through the intersection of the \n\nthree-dimensional yield surface with the axisymmetric plane, as shown in Figure 4.6. The \n\nresulting bi-dimensional contour can be transformed into a coordinate system defined in the \n\nstress space m 11 33( , )? ? ? ?  where the mean stress, m?  is given by Equation (3.29) and the \n\nother axis, 11 33( )? ? ?  is defined according with the von Mises equivalent stress, e?  given in \n\nEquation (3.30).  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n46  2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 4.5.

As seen in the 3D \n\nrepresentations, a clear reduction of the size of the yield loci along the hydrostatic axis is \n\nevidenced when increasing the void volume fraction. Furthermore, a change of the \n\nproportions of the yield locus is also observed. The change of shape shown in the \n\naxisymmetric plane is due to the distinct response of the yield surface along the hydrostatic \n\naxis and on the ?-plane. For the porosity values tested, regardless of the SD effects, the yield \n\nlocus sensitivity to porosity in the hydrostatic axis is much higher than in the ?-plane, as \n\nsmall variations of the porosity value tend to greatly reduce the size of the yield projection \n\non the former. However, unlike the ?-plane case, the sensitivity of the yield locus to the \n\nporosity along the hydrostatic axis is not constant. This statement can be confirmed through \n\nthe analysis of the derivative of the compressive hydrostatic limit, Yp?\n?  (given in Equation \n\n(3.27)) with respect to f , such that: \n\n ( )Y 1\nT 2 2\n\n2 2 1\nln .\n\n3 3\np\n\nq f\nf f q q f?\n\n?? ? ? ? ? ?? ?\n= =? ? ? ? ? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? ?\n\n \n(4.3) \n\nIt is concluded that the sensitivity of the yield surface size along the hydrostatic axis is \n\ninversely proportional to the porosity value and to the fitting parameter 2 .q  Thus, although \n\nfor relatively low values of porosity the sensitivity on the hydrostatic axis is dominant, one \n\ncan expect that there is an instant (i.e. a void volume fraction value, f.) at which the \n\nsensitivity to the porosity in the ?-plane will prevail.

Influence of the stress state \n\nAs outlined in the previous chapters, the stress state plays a key role in the description \n\nof the ductile fracture. Recall that, concerning the study of ductile fracture mechanics, the \n\nstress state is often described by two dimensionless parameters: the stress triaxiality, T?  and \n\nthe Lode angle parameter, ??  (quantifying 3J\n? ). In fact, as discussed previously, the stress \n\nstate, particularly the stress triaxiality, is responsible for determining the active void growth \n\nmicro-mechanism: shape changing versus volumetric changing void growth. Consequently, \n\nit is important to understand how a stress state affects the yield criterion and how can it be \n\nvisualized both on a three-dimensional and on a two-dimensional space.  \n\nThis section discusses the influence of the stress state on the CPB06 porous yield loci \n\nfor three virtual materials displaying different tension\u2013compression asymmetries (as in \n\nSubsection 4.1). Firstly, the sensitivity of the deviatoric plane projections to the mean stress, \n\nm?  is analysed. Following it, 3D representations are shown, illustrating the intersection of \n\nthe yield loci with a surface of constant stress triaxiality. This analysis is complemented with \n\na 2D projection on the axisymmetric plane, illustrating graphically the stress triaxiality and \n\nits influence on the yielding of the three materials displaying different SD effects. \n\n4.2.1.

This behaviour is similar for all materials. Such as in the study of the \n\ninfluence of the porosity in the ?-plane for a fixed value of the mean stress (see Figure 4.5), \n\nthe yield surfaces of Figure 4.8 decrease in size but retain their original shape. This enforces \n\nthat the shape of the yield locus on the deviatoric plane is solely governed by the tension\u2013\n\ncompression asymmetry, through the sign and magnitude of the material parameter k. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n50  2018 \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 4.8.

In fact, the yield \n\nsurface sensitivity to the mean stress increases continuously with its absolute value. This \n\nremark can be verified by analysing any quadrant of the axisymmetric plane projections plots \n\nrepresented in Figure 4.7.

The plots of Figure 4.8 only show curves \n\nfor a single void volume fraction ( f = 0.01); however the porosity value also affects the yield \n\nloci sensitivity to the mean stress, i.e. the rate at which the projected area in the ?-plane \n\ndecreases whit increasing hydrostatic stress (tensile or compressive). By analysing Figure \n\n4.7 and/or Equation (4.4) it is possible to verify that the sensitivity to the mean stress \n\nincreases with the increase of the porosity. In other words, there is a sooner and shaper \n\nreduction of the dimension along the deviatoric plane with respect to the mean stress \n\nnormalized by its ultimate value, Yp?\n+  or Yp?\n\n? . \n\n4.2.2. Effect of the stress triaxiality \nIt is well-known that the stress triaxiality, T?  is defined by the ratio between the mean \n\nstress and the equivalent von Mises stress (see Equation (2.6)). However, the visualization \n\nof this parameter in the three-dimensional space or even in the two-dimensional space may \n\nnot be evident. This subsection intends to address this subject.  \n\nBy itself, the stress triaxiality is incapable of fully defining a stress state. In the fracture \n\nmechanics framework, the pair ( T? ,?? ) is often used to define the direction of the principal \n\nstress vector, 1 2 3( , , )? ? ?  and, complementary, the mean stress or the equivalent stress is \n\nused to set its magnitude. Indeed, three independent parameters are required to fully \n\ncharacterize a stress state. With that said, the stress triaxiality alone defines an infinite \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n52  2018 \n\n \n\nsurface that contains all the points that verify a specific ratio m e/ .? ?  In the three-dimensional \n\nspace, this corresponds to the definition of a circular cone, whose vertex coincides with the \n\norigin of the coordinate system (both Cartesian and cylindrical), collinear with the \n\nhydrostatic axis with an opening angle quantified by the stress triaxiality value. Figure 4.9 \n\nshows the intersection of several stress triaxiality cones with the yield loci of the isotropic \n\nCPB06 porous model, for three materials displaying different tension-compression \n\nasymmetry. The yield surfaces were sectioned to facilitate the visualization of the stress \n\ntriaxiality cones and the curves resulting from the intersections. \n\n \n\n   \n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFigure 4.9. 3D section view of the intersection between the CPB06 porous model and several stress triaxialities \nfor a material with f = 0.010 and: (a) no tension-compression asymmetry (k = 0); (b) yield strength in tension \ngreater than in compression (k = 0.3098); (c) yield strength in tension lower than in compression (k = \u20130.3098).  \n\nAs shown in Figure 4.9 (a) \u2013 material with no tension-compression asymmetry \u2013 the \n\nintersection resultant from any stress triaxiality cone with the yield surface occurs at a fixed \n\nmean stress, i.e. results in circles at a constant height with respect to the middle plane, \n\nm 0.? =  However, the same does not occurs for the materials exhibiting SD effects, either \n\nfor 0k >  or 0.k &lt; In this case, the intersection results in closed curves in which both the \n\nradius and the height vary with the angular coordinate. This is due to the fact that the yield \n\nloci does not have a circular shape in the ?-plane (as in Figure 4.9 (a)). The SD effects, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nSensitivity Analysis of the CPB06 Porous Model Yield Surfaces  \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  53 \n\n \n\nintroduced by the sensitivity to 3J\n? , originate the triangular shape of the yield surfaces. Thus, \n\nthe von Mises equivalent stress \u2013 proportional to the radial coordinate \u2013 varies with the \n\nangular coordinate and, consequently, the mean stress will also have to vary in order to \n\nmaintain a constant m e/? ?  ratio, i.e. a constant stress triaxiality. \n\nThe influence of the tension-compression asymmetry on the definition of the \n\nintersection point between the yield surface and a specified stress triaxiality value can also \n\nbe analysed in two-dimensional representations. Figure 4.10 illustrates the axisymmetric \n\nplane projections of the CPB06 porous yield criterion, for the three materials considered in \n\nthis study, and the same stress triaxiality values as in Figure 4.9. Note that in the two-\n\ndimensional axisymmetric space \u2013 m 11 33( , ),? ? ? ?  the cone-shaped geometric surfaces of the \n\nprevious analysis give rise to simple straight lines through the origin, with a slope quantified \n\nby the stress triaxiality value. As stated in Subsection 3.3, under axisymmetric stress states \n\ntwo cases can be distinguished: \n\ni. 33 11 ,? > ?  which corresponds to 3 0J\n? >  and 1;?? =  \n\nii. 33 11 ,? &lt;?  which corresponds to 3 0J\n? &lt; and 1.?? =  \n\nAccording to Figure 4.10 it is verified that, if SD effects are displayed, the intersection of \n\nthe constant triaxiality lines with the yield locus does not occur at the same abscissa, m?  for \n\n3 0J\n? >  and 3 0.J\n\n? &lt; \n\nMoreover, note that, with the exception of the second quadrant m 3( 0 0),J\n?? &lt;? >  for \n\nwhich SD effects do not manifest in the yield surface shape \u2013 see Equation (3.42)), the \n\ncontours characterized by 0k >  are contained within the von Mises yield locus and the \n\ncontours with 0k &lt; are the outermost. For the other quadrants, this means that, regardless \n\nof the imposed stress triaxiality, in axisymmetric loadings the plastic flow will occur first in \n\nthe material with yield strength in tension greater than in compression ( 0).k >  Although it \n\nmay seem a counter-intuitive result for loadings with m 0,? >  this behaviour is supported \n\nby numerical simulations on unit cells/RVEs (Cazacu &amp; Stewart, 2009; Lebensohn &amp; \n\nCazacu, 2012; Stewart &amp; Cazacu, 2011). In the next chapter, elementary numerical \n\nsimulations will be performed in order to study of the response of the porous model to \n\naxisymmetric loadings and Figure 4.10 will be revised to understand and justify the results \n\nobtained. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n54  2018 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.10.

Assessment of the Damage Model Response \nthrough Elementary Numerical Tests \n\nAlthough several micromechanical FEA on three-dimensional unit cells2 have been \n\nconducted showing the importance of SD effects on the dilatational response of porous \n\nsolids, to the author's knowledge, an assessment of the capability of the CPB06 porous model \n\nto replicate the mechanical behaviour predicted in the unit cell simulations is still lacking.  \n\nIn order to fill this gap, in this chapter a numeric analysis is conducted in order to \n\nevaluate the ability of the damage model to effectively describe the plastic flow of the matrix \n\nand the accumulated damage in porous solids exhibiting tension\u2013compression asymmetry. \n\nFor this purpose, single-element tests are carried out for macroscopic axisymmetric stress \n\nstates, corresponding to a fixed stress triaxiality value and the two corresponding possible \n\nvalues of the Lode parameter (or sign of 3J\n? ); as well as for hydrostatic loadings, both tensile \n\nand compressive. A brief sensitivity analysis will also be carried out regarding the matrix \n\nisotropic hardening law parameters.  \n\n5.1.

For more details regarding the \n\nimplementation of the present boundary value problem the reader is referred to the work of \n\nAlves et al.

The materials are considered to be isotropic elastic-plastic obeying to the \n\nCPB06 porous yield criterion, ' T( , , , ) 0,k f? ? =?  given in Equation (3.24). The elastic \n\nbehaviour is described by Hooke\u2019s law and the matrix tensile hardening behaviour is \n\nconsidered to follow Swift\u2019s isotropic hardening power-law, given by: \n\n ( )\n1/T\n\np 0\nT 0 M 0,   with  ,\n\nn\nn\n\nK\nK\n?\n\n? ? ? ?\n? ?\n\n= + = ? ?\n? ?\n\n \n(5.8) \n\nwhere T?  is the matrix flow stress, \nT\n0?  is the initial yield strength in tension, \n\np\nM?  is the local \n\nequivalent plastic strain of the matrix and K, n and 0?  are material parameters. The values \n\nfor the matrix elastic and hardening parameters were taken to be the same as those considered \n\nby Alves &amp; Cazacu (2015) and are resumed in Table 5.1.

In order to facilitate the analysis, the plastic strain controlled nucleation \n\nmechanism is neglected, so that the void volume fraction rate of change, f?  is exclusively \n\ndue to the growth of pre-existing voids. Moreover, as mentioned in Chapter 2, the load-\n\nbearing capacity of the material is abruptly reduced when the onset of coalescence is reach. \n\nTherefore, by establishing a critical value for the void volume fraction (in the form of cf ), \n\nit will be possible to distinguish the onsets of failure for the three materials, allowing to \n\nquantify the ductility of the porous solids for a given stress state. Note that, since the \n\nparameter k is the only parameter that varies between the three solids, any difference \n\nresulting from the simulations for a given stress triaxiality will be due solely to SD effects. \n\nThe computations are stopped when either one of the two conditions occur: (i) the void \n\nvolume fraction reaches its arbitrated critical value c( );f f?

Moreover, for theses loadings the third invariant of the stress deviator \n\ntensor is null, 3 0J\n? = , hence the Lode angle, ?? , (and Lode parameter, ?? ) are undefined. \n\nFigure 5.11 shows the comparison between the normalized macroscopic von Mises \n\neffective stress, e?  versus the macroscopic effective strain, eE  for the three porous solids, \n\ncorresponding to the FE computations for the tensile and compressive hydrostatic loadings. \n\nFor both cases, the void volume fraction evolution, f  is illustrated in Figure 5.12 \u2013 void \n\ngrowth with hydrostatic tension and void collapse in the hydrostatic compression case.

This \n\nstress triaxiality results from the well-known equibiaxial tension (EBT) stress state, which \n\nis of great practical importance in sheet metal forming, and is characterized by 11 22? = ?  \n\nwith 33 0? =  for which 3 0.J\n? &lt; As for the remaining axisymmetric loadings, the conclusions \n\ndrawn from this case are equally applicable and therefore a brief discussion will be made \n\nsolely on the effect of increasing the stress triaxiality, specifically on the damage \n\naccumulation, material ductility and on the impact of the SD effects of the matrix in the \n\nmechanical response of the porous solid. \n\nAnalysing Figure 5.2 it is clear that the SD effects (described by the parameter k), \n\naffect the mechanical response of the porous solids, namely the maximum von Mises \n\neffective stress, e?  and the softening behaviour of the porous solids. In the case 3 0,J\n? >  the \n\ndifferent porosity evolutions clearly differentiate the onset of failure and, consequently, the \n\nmaximum macroscopic strain, eE  that is reached \u2013 a good indicator of the materials ductility \n\n(or its formability). In addition to having the highest macroscopic effective stress throughout \n\nthe entire deformation history, the material characterized by k = \u20130.3098 also exhibits the \n\nhighest ductility for the evolution characterized by 3 0.J\n? >  In fact, although there is some \n\nsoftening effect on this material, the simulation ended without reaching the onset of the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAssessment of the Damage Model Response through Elementary Numerical Tests \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  65 \n\n \n\ncoalescence. The same conclusion could be drawn from Figure 5.3. Indeed, the damage \n\nmodel predicts that, for axisymmetric loadings with 3 0,J\n? >  the higher the SD ratio, (i.e. the \n\nhigher the parameter k), the earlier the failure onset occurs. In other words, due to the slower \n\nvoid growth rate, f?  for 3 0J\n? >  (see Figure 5.4) there is an enhanced ductility for porous \n\nsolids with yield strength in tension lower than in compression, 0.k &lt; However, the damage \n\nmodel does not predict the same behaviour for the loading characterized by 3 0.J\n? &lt; In this \n\ncase, the void growth rate, represented in Figure 5.4 (b) is insensitive to SD effects of the \n\nmatrix and, consequently, all three materials present the same evolution of the void volume \n\nfraction, equal to the one of the matrix, characterized by k = 0 (von Mises material). This \n\nmeans that, for evolutions with 3 0,J\n? &lt; the onset of failure will always occur for the same \n\nmacroscopic von Mises equivalent strain, eE  and, therefore, the tension-compression \n\nasymmetry will not affect the ductility of the porous material. Moreover, by presenting the \n\nsame porosity evolution, the materials exhibit very similar softening behaviours (see Figure \n\n5.2 (b)), contrasting with the numerical results obtained for the axisymmetric stress state \n\nwith 3 0J\n? >  (Figure 5.2 (a)).  \n\nAlthough for loadings with 3 0J\n? &lt; the porosity evolution is insensitive to the tension-\n\ncompression asymmetry of the matrix, the CPB06 damage model is able to account of the \n\nSD effects in the yielding of the porous solids. Indeed, the numerical results of the \n\nmacroscopic von Mises equivalent stress evolution are in agreement with the specificities of \n\nthe yield surface for axisymmetric states, represented in Figure 4.10. This figure shows that, \n\nfor a given stress triaxiality, a distinct behaviour on yielding occurs for 3 0J\n? >  and for \n\n3 0,J\n? &lt; as the SD effects are manifested very differently. In the particular case of 2/3T? =\n\nand for 3 0,J\n? >  the curves denoting the yielding of each material for a particular void volume \n\nfraction value, f  are practically coincident, whereas for 3 0J\n? &lt; a clear differentiation in the \n\nyield locus of the materials is shown. Note also that, as the stress triaxiality increases, i.e. as \n\nthe lines approach the hydrostatic axis, the differences in the yielding loci for 3 0J\n? >  and \n\n3 0J\n? &lt; are reduced. This behaviour is well captured in the numerical simulations for 3 0,J\n\n? >\n\nin which a departure of the macroscopic equivalent stress curves from the one obtained with \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n66  2018 \n\n \n\nthe von Mises material (k = 0) is observed with the increase of the stress triaxiality value \n\n(see Figure 5.2 (a), Figure 5.5 (a) and Figure 5.8 (a)). \n\nThe behaviour predicted by the CPB06 porous model for axisymmetric loadings \n\ncharacterized by 3 0J\n? >  seems to be in overall good agreement with FEA results obtained \n\nin detailed three-dimensional micromechanical studies through unit cells (e.g. the work of \n\nAlves &amp; Cazacu (2015a); Alves et al. (2017)). However, the same studies reveal completely \n\ndifferent findings for axisymmetric stress states characterized by 3 0,J\n? &lt; when compared \n\nwith the numerical results obtained in the present analysis. In the micromechanical unit cell \n\nsimulations was concluded that, in the same way as in the 3 0J\n? >  case, the damage \n\naccumulation (i.e. the void growth) for 3 0J\n? &lt; is strongly influenced by the SD effects of the \n\nmatrix. In this case, the material with the lowest SD ratio (i.e., lowest parameter k) will \n\ncontinue to present the highest macroscopic von Mises equivalent stress, e .?  However, and \n\nopposing to the 3 0J\n? >  stress state, there will be an enhanced ductility for the porous solids \n\nwith yield strength in tension greater than in compression, 0.k >   \n\nAccording to the cited micromechanical studies, the differences in the porosity \n\nevolution (and ultimately on the ductility of the porous materials) with the sign of 3J\n?  can \n\nbe explained by the distribution and heterogeneity of the local plastic strains and local \n\nstresses that arise around the micro-voids then SD effects are displayed, which are markedly \n\ndifferent than in a von Mises material. In these studies is also shown that, even if at the \n\nmacroscopic level, i.e. 11 22 33( , , ),? ? ?  there is a very small difference in the macroscopic \n\nstress\u2013strain response of the materials, the differences in the local state fields, 11 22 33( , , ),? ? ?  \n\nare very strong. It should be also noted that in the present study it is considered that the onset \n\nof failure occurs in all materials for the same critical porosity value, i.e. it is independent of \n\nthe SD effects displayed by the matrix. However, this assumption may not be accurate. In \n\nfact, unit cell computations show (through the inter-void spacing or the cell's cross section \n\nmonitoring) that the onset of coalescence occurs for slightly different void volume fraction \n\nvalues in the porous solids exhibiting different SD effects (Alves &amp; Cazacu, 2015b). \n\nBeing incapable of accounting for SD effects on the porosity evolution for loadings \n\nwith 3 0,J\n? &lt; the CPB06 damage model will also be unable to reproduce distinct softening \n\nbehaviours, and ultimately fail to reliably predict the ductile fracture of the porous solids \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAssessment of the Damage Model Response through Elementary Numerical Tests \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  67 \n\n \n\ndisplaying tension-compression asymmetry. Thus, the question arises as to why the damage \n\nmodel is insensitive to the SD effects in the void growth rate, f?  for, and only for, 3 0.J\n? &lt; \n\nNote that this particular stress state corresponds to the fourth quadrant of the axisymmetric \n\nprojection in the space m 11 33( , ),? ? ? ?  represented in Figure 4.10. Analysing this quadrant it \n\nseems that the yielding curves are obtained through a homothetic transformation. Since the \n\nhomothetic centre coincides with the origin of the coordinate system, the homothety is said \n\nto be a uniform scaling. Let O denote the origin of the m 11 33( , )? ? ? ?  stress space and P an \n\narbitrary point on the von Mises curve. The yield surfaces displaying SD effects can be \n\nobtained based on the von Mises curve ( 0),k =  by the linear transformation:  \n\n , OP t OP\n???? ????\n\n?  (5.9) \n\nwhere t is a scale factor, equal in all directions which, as will be shown below, is given by \n\nthe ratio C T/ .? ?  Being similar curves (in the geometric sense), the tangent to the points \n\nresulting from the intersection between the yield loci and the stress triaxiality lines are equal \n\nin all three materials. A more reasoned mathematical analysis is now presented in order to \n\nsupport these observations. In mathematics, a real valued function, :s ?? ?  is said to be \n\nhomogeneous of degree ? if: \n\n ( ) ( ),   0.s tx t s x t? ?= >  (5.10) \nThese functions are characterized by their multiplicative scaling behaviour \u2013 the level sets \n\nof a homogenous function are radial expansions and contractions of each other. Moreover, \n\nthe tangent lines to the level sets of a homogeneous function, ( )s x  along each ray extending \n\nfrom the origin have constant slopes. One can prove that the axisymmetric yield loci for \n\nm 30 0J\n?? > ? >  is a homogenous function. Rearranging Equation (3.41), defined for \n\nm 0,? >  results: \n\n ( ) 2C Te m e 3 1 2 m\nT C\n\n3\n1 2 cosh ,\n\n2\nf q f q f q\n\n? ?\n? ?\n\n? ?? ?? ?\n? = ? ? ? = ? + ? ?? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? ?\n\n \n(5.11) \n\nwhere e 11 33 T( )/?? = ? ? ?  is the normalized macroscopic von Mises equivalent stress and \n\nm m T/?? = ?  is the normalized macroscopic mean stress. For a von Mises material ( 0),k =  \n\ni.e. for a unitary SD ratio, the previous expression resumes to the reference yield locus: \n\n 2e 3 1 2 m0\n3\n\n1 2 cosh .\n2k\n\nq f q f q\n=\n\n? ?\n? = ? + ? ?? ?\n\n? ?\n\n \n(5.12) \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n68  2018 \n\n \n\nBy multiplying the argument of e?  in Equation (5.11) by the factor C T( / )? ?  results: \n\n e m e e 0 .\nC C\n\nk\nT T\n\nf\n? ?\n? ? =\n\n? ?? ? ? ?\n? = ? ? ? = ?? ?? ? ? ?\n\n? ? ? ?? ?\n\n \n(5.13) \n\nIt follows that the yield loci in the fourth quadrant of Figure 4.10 is a homogenous function \n\nwith a degree of homogeneity ? = 1, i.e. both the hydrostatic axis and the deviatoric axis are \n\nscaled linearly by the factor C T/ .? ?  It is thus confirmed that for a given stress triaxiality, T?  \n\nthe normal to the surfaces at the point of intersection is independent of the material parameter \n\nk. As a consequence, according to the normality principle, the direction of the plastic strain \n\nincrement is insensitive to SD effects.  \n\nIn order to comprehend the insensitivity of the void growth rate, f?  to the SD effects \n\nfor tensile stress states with 3 0,J\n? &lt; the damage evolution law for the opposite stress state, \n\ni.e. 3 0,J\n? >  is firstly analysed. Recovering Equation (3.18), obtained from the mass \n\nconservation principle, and combining this expression with Equations (3.25), (3.32) and \n\n(3.39) results: \n\n ( ) ( )\n3 m\n\np eT 1 2 T\ngrowth 20,  0\n\nC T C T\n\n3 3\n1 1 sinh ,\n\n2kkJ\nq q f\n\nf f D f q T\n? ?\n\n?\n? ? ? ?? ?> ? >\n\n? ?? ? ?\n= ? = ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\n? ?\n\n \n(5.14) \n\nwhere e??  is the macroscopic equivalent stress according to the CPB06 isotropic yield \n\ncriterion. Figure 5.13 (a) represents with dash-dot lines the evolution of the local equivalent \n\nplastic strain of the matrix material, pM?  for a tensile axisymmetric loading with 3 0.J\n? >  In \n\nthis case, it is shown that the magnitude of the plastic strain increment, quantified by the \n\nplastic multiplier, ?  in Equation (5.14), is independent of SD effects. Furthermore, note the \n\npresence of the T / C? ?  ratio both on the argument of the hyperbolic sine and on its \n\nmultiplying factors. This corroborates the distinct porosity evolutions obtained in the \n\nnumerical tests (e.g. Figure 5.3 (a)), according to the k value. The evolution of the normalized \n\nCPB06 equivalent stress, e T/ ,???  a parameter also present in the hyperbolic sine argument \n\nof Equation (5.14), is presented in Figure 5.13 (b). It is shown that, although for low values \n\nof the macroscopic strain, eE  the e T/???  curves are coincident, they diverge from the \n\nreference von Mises curve ( 0),k =  due to the distinct damage evolutions (see Figure 5.3 \n\n(a)) and resultant softening behaviours. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAssessment of the Damage Model Response through Elementary Numerical Tests \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  69 \n\n \n\nOnce recognized the source of the void growth rate sensitivity to the SD effects for \n\ntensile loadings with 3 0,J\n? >  the damage evolution law for 3 0J\n\n? &lt; is now analysed. \n\nRearranging Equation (3.18) and, as in the previous case, combining it with Equations \n\n(3.25), (3.32) and (3.39), yields: \n\n ( ) ( )\n3 m\n\np eT 1 2\ngrowth 20,  0\n\nC T T\n\n3 3\n1 1 sinh ,\n\n2kkJ\nq q f\n\nf f D f q T\n?\n\n?\n? ? ?? ?&lt;? >\n\n? ?? ? ?\n= ? = ? ? ?? ?\n\n? ? ? ?\n\n?\n\n? ?\n\n \n(5.15) \n\nNote that, due to the axisymmetric stress state relationships (see Equation (3.39)), the T C/? ?  \n\nratio is no longer present in the argument of the hyperbolic sine. Furthermore, recall that due \n\nto the yield function homogeneity, the plastic strain increment has the same direction, as \n\noppose to the 3 0J\n? >  case. Nonetheless it is possible to show that the magnitude of this \n\nincrement, quantified by the plastic multiplier, ?  depends on the SD effects. This remark \n\ncan be confirmed by the dash-dot lines represented in Figure 5.14 (a), showing the evolution \n\nof the local equivalent plastic strain, pM?  for a tensile axisymmetric loading with 3 0.J\n? &lt; It \n\nis confirmed that the evolutions corresponding to the solids exhibiting SD effects do not \n\nmatch with the von Mises curve, ( 0).k =  Indeed, it can be shown that the former curves can \n\nbe obtained based the von Mises reference curve by multiplying each point by the scaling \n\nfactor C T/ .? ?  As a result, it is concluded that the plastic multiplier, ?  is responsible for \n\nimplicitly eliminating the single scaling effect of the T / C? ?  ratio present in the previous \n\nexpression. This ultimately makes the void growth rate insensitive to the SD effects. \n\nFigure 5.14 (a) shows the CPB06 equivalent stress evolutions for the studied porous \n\nmaterials. Note that, even displaying the same porosity evolution (see Figure 5.3 (b)), the \n\ndistinct local equivalent plastic strain distribution that arise in the materials displaying SD \n\neffects for tensile loadings with 3 0J\n? &lt; imply that the flow stress, T?  and, as a result, the \n\nCPB06 equivalent stress, e??  present different evolutions for the three solids. Even so, it \n\nshould be noted that, if normalized by its current flow stress in tension, i.e. the ratio e T/???  \n\n(see Equation (5.15)), the normalized CPB06 equivalent stress presents the same evolution, \n\nregardless of the SD effects (see Figure 5.14 (b)). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n70  2018 \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 5.13.

(or the Lode parameter value, 1?? = \u00b1 ) on the \n\nvoid growth rate, and ultimately on the porous solid ductility. The same conclusions hold \n\ntrue for the remaining stress triaxialities studied, viz. 1T? =  and 2.T? =  In these cases, \n\nanalysing Figure 5.5 and Figure 5.8, one can verify that with the increase of the stress \n\ntriaxiality there is a decrease in the ductility of the porous solids. This behaviour is closely \n\nrelated to the higher void growth rate (see Figure 5.4, Figure 5.7 and Figure 5.10). This \n\nwould be expected since the stress triaxiality value arises in the argument of the hyperbolic \n\nsine, as shown in Equation (5.14) (recall that the hyperbolic sine is a monotonic increasing \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAssessment of the Damage Model Response through Elementary Numerical Tests \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  71 \n\n \n\nfunction). Furthermore, the increase of the stress triaxiality also causes an earlier triggering \n\nof the materials softening and, consequently, the macroscopic von Mises equivalent stresses \n\nreach their maximum values for smaller macroscopic equivalent strains. Note that the plastic \n\ndeformation process of a porous solid involves two concurrent behaviours: the matrix \n\nhardening with the local equivalent plastic strain; and the porosity evolution with the \n\nmacroscopic/volumetric dilatation of the aggregate. Regardless of the SD effects, since high \n\nlevels of porosity are achieved faster at high stress triaxialities, the softening of the solid due \n\nto the increased porosity rapidly overcomes the hardening of the matrix, thereby reducing \n\nits ductility, i.e. the ability to undergo plastic deformation before final failure. \n\nConcerning the influence of the SD effects on the response of the material, Figure 5.3 \n\n(a), Figure 5.6 (a) and Figure 5.9 (a) show that, with the increase of the stress triaxiality, the \n\nabsolute difference between the evolutions of the void volume fraction for the studied values \n\nof the material parameter k decreases, i.e. the evolutions approximate the one of the von \n\nMises material (k = 0). In fact, as a limit case, the SD effects do not manifest on the porosity \n\nevolution at T? ? ?  (tensile hydrostatic loading), represented in Figure 5.12 (a). In this \n\ncase, the small differences in the porosity evolution are simply due to the distinct instants \n\nfor which the materials enter the plastic regime (see Figure 4.10). This means that, as in \n\nnumerical simulations for tensile axisymmetric loadings with 3 0,J\n? &lt; the damage model \n\npredicts that the ductility of the three materials exhibiting different SD effects will be \n\nidentical. Numerical observations through unit cell simulations need to be conducted in order \n\nto validate the predicted trends. Regarding the macroscopic stress-strain response of the \n\ntensile hydrostatic loading simulation (see Figure 5.11 (a)) once again it is noted the atypical \n\nresult that the plastic flow occurs first in the material with yield strength in tension greater \n\nthan in compression. Such behaviour contrasts with the response obtained for the \n\ncompressive hydrostatic loading simulations, shown in Figure 5.11 (b). In this case, as \n\nexpected (e.g. see Figure 4.10), the plastic flow is independent of the SD effects \u2013 yielding \n\nfor compressive hydrostatic loading depends uniquely on the yield strength in tension, which \n\nis assumed to be equal in all three materials. Note also that the macroscopic stress-strain \n\nevolution for the compressive hydrostatic loading, ,T? ? ??  exhibits a completely different \n\nbehaviour than the other curves analysed so far. Indeed, since the porous materials are \n\nsubjected to a negative stress triaxiality loading the voids tend to collapse. This way, as \n\nshown in Figure 5.12 (b), as the porosity tends to zero, 0,f ?  the damage model loses its \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n72  2018 \n\n \n\nsensitivity to the first invariant of the macroscopic stress tensor, 1 .I\n?  In other words, the \n\nporous solids becomes incompressible and their yield surfaces become infinite along the \n\nhydrostatic axis. As a result, once the porosity vanishes, the plastic deformation halts and \n\nthe stress-strain response becomes linear, respecting Hooke's law for continuous media. \n\n5.4. Sensitivity analysis of the hardening law parameters \n\nIn this section a brief sensitivity analysis on the damage evolution and on the \n\nmechanical properties degradation of porous solids exhibiting SD effects is performed, \n\ntaking into account the variation of the isotropic hardening law parameters, namely the \n\nSwift\u2019s law normalized hardening coefficient, T0/K ?  and the hardening exponent, n (see \n\nEquation (5.8)). \n\nThe sensitivity analysis performed is mono-parametric, meaning that the variation of \n\none parameter is achieved by fixing the other hardening parameter. Figure 5.15 shows the \n\nstress-strain curves obtained through Equation (5.8) for the porous solid matrix, representing \n\nthe effect of the variation of each of the hardening parameters in the normalized matrix \n\ntensile flow stress, TT 0/ .? ?  \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 5.15. Flow stress versus local equivalent plastic strain curves for the matrix material varying:  \n(a) the hardening coefficient, T0/ ;K ?  (b) the hardening exponent, n. \n\nIt can be verified that the nature of the evolution of the tensile flow stress, that is, the \n\nrate of hardening, is governed by the parameter n and the hardening coefficient, T0/ ,K ?  \n\nwhich also acts as a scale factor. Note that for a fixed value of the hardening coefficient, (see \n\nFigure 5.15 (b)), the material with the highest hardening exponent, n, presents the lowest \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAssessment of the Damage Model Response through Elementary Numerical Tests \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  73 \n\n \n\nmatrix flow stress for a local equivalent plastic strain smaller than unity. Once this value is \n\nexceeded, this trend is inverted and the material with the highest hardening exponent takes \n\nthe highest flow stress value. The opposite holds true for the material with the lowest \n\nhardening exponent. This behaviour indicates that the lower the hardening exponent, the \n\nearlier the hardening starts to occur, but, correspondingly, the earlier the hardening saturation \n\nwill take place. \n\nFigure 5.16 show a comparison of the normalized macroscopic von Mises effective \n\nstress, Te 0/??  and the corresponding void volume fraction evolution, f  evolutions for the \n\nthree porous solids under an axisymmetric loading with 1T? =  and 3 0,J\n? >  when varying \n\nthe hardening coefficient, T0/ .K ?  Figure 5.17 shows the same type of results obtained when \n\nvarying the hardening exponent, n. In order to simplify the graphical analysis only two \n\nhardening parameter values are represented. The analysis is performed only for 3 0J\n? >  \n\nsince, as previously observed, there is a insensitivity to parameter k for 3 0.J\n? &lt;  \n\nThe macroscopic stress-strain response of the materials when varying the parameter \nT\n0/K ?  is very similar to the result observed in Figure 5.15 (a). It is shown that the variation \n\nof this parameter does not influences the ductility of the materials nor its softening \n\nbehaviour. In summary, the hardening parameter T0/K ?  acts simply as a scale factor, that is, \n\nthe strength of the materials is changed but not its deformation history. Moreover, one can \n\nverify that neither the hardening coefficient, T0/K ?  nor the hardening exponent, n influence \n\nthe void volume fraction evolution, which are exactly coincident (see Figure 5.16 (b) and \n\nFigure 5.17 (b)). Note that the hardening law only dictates the way the yield locus expands, \n\nthat is, the parameters defining the hardening law impact the size of the yield surface but not \n\nits shape. As seen in the previous chapter, for isotropic porous solids the shape of the yield \n\nsurface is governed exclusively by the tension-compression asymmetry of the matrix. This \n\nimplies that for a given stress state ( T? ,?? ) the normal to the yield locus and, consequently, \n\nthe differences in the void grow rate are independent of the isotropic hardening law \n\nspecificities. \n\nAlthough no changes in ductility are observed, contrasting to the hardening coefficient, \nT\n0/ ,K ?  the hardening exponent, n, of the Swift\u2019s law strongly effects the softening behaviour \n\nof the materials. In this case, as shown in Figure 5.17 (a), a clear competition between the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n74  2018 \n\n \n\nmatrix hardening behaviour and the softening effects due to the increase of the porosity is \n\nobserved. The combination of both phenomena describe the final response of the porous \n\nmaterials. For the materials with the lower hardening exponent, (n = 0.05), hardening starts \n\nto occur earlier. Thus, the corresponding stress-strain evolutions clearly present higher yield \n\nstress values than the curves referring to the higher hardening exponent, (n = 0.2), for low \n\nmacroscopic equivalent strain values. However, hardening saturation will also occur firstly \n\non the materials with the lowest hardening exponent n. Therefore, the softening caused by \n\nthe increase of the porosity will cancel (and exceed) the hardening effects at lower values of \n\nthe macroscopic equivalent strain. This means that the hardening exponent, n affects not \n\nonly the maximum macroscopic von Mises yield stress in the stress-strain plots (quantifying \n\nthe material\u2019s strength), but also the position, i.e. the value of the macroscopic equivalent \n\nstrain, for which the maximum yield stress occurs. In short, for a fixed hardening coefficient, \nT\n0/ ,K ?  the higher the hardening exponent, n, the later the maximum macroscopic yield stress \n\nwill occur. Note that, it is expected that materials with a lower hardening exponent present \n\nthe maximum equivalent yield stress. However, the ultimate yield strength \u2013 corresponding \n\nto the onset of failure (moment at which the critical void volume fraction is reached), of the \n\nmaterials with higher hardening exponents may surpass the ultimate yield strength of the \n\nones with a lower hardening exponent.

Conclusions \nIn this work, the capability of the so-called isotropic CPB06 porous model \u2013 a coupled \n\nmicromechanical-based damage model \u2013 to reliably describe the damage evolution and \n\npredict the ductile fracture of porous solids exhibiting tension-compression asymmetry was \n\ninvestigated. For this purpose, in an introductory way, a detailed sensitivity analysis of the \n\ndamage model parameters was carried out, based on the yield loci change of shape and size \n\nwith material, damage and stress state related parameters. An attempt was made to emphasise \n\nthe importance of the role played by all stress invariants commonly used in the fracture \n\nmechanics framework, namely the 3J\n?  invariant for describing the SD effects and the 1I\n\n?  \n\ninvariant to describe the effect of the mean stress. Next, a numerical analysis was conducted \n\nbased on single-element tests, under macroscopic tensile axisymmetric loadings. The goal \n\nwas to evaluate the predictive ability of the isotropic damage model by comparing the results \n\nwith the behaviours predicted by documented and well-accepted micromechanical finite \n\nelement computations on three-dimensional unit cells. The main conclusions of the \n\ninvestigations conducted within the context of this thesis are described below. \n\nThe sensitivity analysis to the yield surfaces of the CPB06 porous model performed in \n\nChapter 4 led to the following key observations: \n\ni. If SD effects are displayed, the yield locus is no longer symmetric with respect to \n\nthe middle plane, m 0.? =  Moreover, it is shown that the SD effects only manifest \n\nin the definition of the upper vertex of the yield locus, i.e. the tensile hydrostatic \n\nyield strength and that, remarkably, the higher the yield strength in compression, \n\nthe higher is this hydrostatic limit; \n\nii. The shape of the yield locus in the deviatoric plane of an isotropic porous solid is \n\nsolely governed by the tension\u2013compression asymmetry displayed by the matrix \n\nmaterial, through the sign and magnitude of the material parameter k, since both the \n\nvoid volume fraction and the mean stress only influence the size of the yield \n\ncontours in the ?-plane projections; \n\niii. In the deviatoric projections at m 0,? =  the radial coordinate of the yield locus \n\ndecreases linearly with increasing porosity, i.e. the yield locus sensitivity to the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n78  2018 \n\n \n\nporosity is constant. Contrasting, the sensitivity of the yield surface size along the \n\nhydrostatic axis is inversely proportional to the porosity value; \n\niv. The yield surfaces present their maximum radii along the deviatoric plane at m 0? =\n\nand the sensitivity of the yield loci to the mean stress increases monotonically \n\ntowards either the tensile or compressive hydrostatic limits. Furthermore, the \n\nsensitivity to the mean stress increases with the increase of the porosity, i.e. the rate \n\nat which the projected area in the ?-plane decreases with the absolute value of the \n\nmean stress; \n\nRegarding the contents of Chapter 5, the single-element numerical tests under tensile \n\naxisymmetric loadings shown that: \n\ni. For 3 0J\n? >  the model clearly distinguish the influence of the tension-compression \n\nasymmetry on the porosity evolution and an enhanced ductility for porous solids \n\nwith yield strength in tension lower than in compression, 0,k &lt; is observed; \n\nii. For 3 0J\n? &lt; the model is unable to distinguish the influence of the tension-\n\ncompression asymmetry on the porosity evolution, and thus, the predicted ductility \n\nof the porous solid is independent of the SD effects. \n\nThe predicted behaviour for loadings characterized by 3 0J\n? >  is in overall good \n\nagreement with FEA three-dimensional micromechanical studies through unit cells, \n\ndocumented in the literature. However, the same studies reveal that, as for the 3 0J\n? >  case, \n\nfor loadings with 3 0J\n? &lt; the porosity evolution should equally be influenced by the SD \n\neffects displayed by the matrix. Moreover, it would be expected that the porous solids with \n\nyield strength in tension greater than in compression, 0,k >  would display an enhanced \n\nductility. Being incapable of accounting for SD effects on the porosity evolution for tensile \n\nloadings with 3 0,J\n? &lt; the damage model is consequently unable to reproduce distinct \n\nsoftening behaviours and, ultimately, fails to reliably predict the ductile fracture onset of the \n\nporous solids displaying tension-compression asymmetry. \n\nIn order to understand the reason for the insensitivity of the damage model to SD \n\neffects for loadings with positive stress triaxialities and 3 0,J\n? &lt; the yield loci projections on \n\nthe axisymmetric plane were analysed. It was shown that in the quadrant of the stress space \n\nm 11 33( , )? ? ? ?  correspondent to this loading type, the curves referring to several materials \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Conclusions \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  79 \n\n \n\nexhibiting different SD effects are homothetic transformations of each other. Hence, the \n\nnormal vector to the yield locus at the point resulting from the intersection with a given stress \n\ntriaxiality is independent of the SD effects displayed by the matrix. Following the normality \n\nprinciple, it was proven that the direction of the plastic strain increment in this quadrant \n\nwould be insensitive to SD effects. However, its magnitude is responsible for implicitly \n\neliminating the single scaling effect of the T / C? ?  ratio present in the void growth rate \n\nfunction. Note that the damage evolution insensitivity to the SD effects occurs only for \n\naxisymmetric loadings with 3 0J\n? &lt; and m 0;? >  indeed, although no compressive \n\naxisymmetric stress states have been studied, for negative triaxiality with 3 0J\n? &lt; the damage \n\nmodel recovers its sensitivity to SD effects in the porosity evolution. \n\nConcerning the effect of the stress triaxiality in the response of the porous aggregates, \n\nit was confirmed that, regardless of the SD effects, with the increase of the stress triaxiality \n\nthe damage model predicts a decrease in the ductility of the solids \u2013 consequence of the \n\nhigher void growth rate. Furthermore, it was shown that as the stress triaxiality tends to \n\ninfinity the influence of the SD effects on the damage evolution (noticeable for 3 0J\n? > ) \n\ndecreases, i.e. the porosity evolutions approximate to the curve referring to the von Mises \n\nmaterial, ( 0).k =  \n\nFinally, the sensitivity analysis regarding the Swift\u2019s hardening law parameters on the \n\ndamage evolution and plastic flow of the porous solids exhibiting SD effects shown that, as \n\nexpected, neither the hardening coefficient, K, nor the hardening exponent, n influence the \n\nvoid volume fraction evolution, and, in the end, the ductility of the materials. This is related \n\nto the fact that the hardening of the matrix impacts the size of the yield surface but not its \n\nshape and, consequently, the plastic flow direction. Furthermore, only the hardening \n\nexponent, n appears to impact the softening behaviour of the materials, as both the maximum \n\nmacroscopic equivalent stress and the macroscopic equivalent strain at which it occurs are \n\nshifted. In fact, it was concluded that for a fixed hardening coefficient, K, the higher the \n\nhardening exponent, n, the later the maximum macroscopic yield stress occurs. \n\nThe preliminary study on the shape and size of the yield loci relative to the void volume \n\nfraction and the stress state revelled to be essential to understand the results obtained in the \n\nelementary tests analysis. This study highlighted the importance of the yield loci shape, \n\nthrough the role played by all stress invariants, on the direction of the plastic strain \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nDuctile fracture prediction using a coupled damage model   \n\n \n\n \n\n80  2018 \n\n \n\nincrements, and consequently on the void growth rate, i.e. damage evolution. It was \n\nconcluded that the application of the CPB06 porous model for tensile loadings with 3 0J\n? &lt; \n\nshould be used with caution, since, in its current form, this coupled damage criterion is \n\nincapable of accurately describe the softening effects and, therefore, the fracture initiation \n\nof ductile materials displaying SD effects.  \n\nNote that, as in Gurson-like criteria, the present model is not suitable for the fracture \n\nprediction under shear-dominated loadings, as the 3J\n? - dependency of the model was \n\nintroduced to model the SD effects of the matrix and not to model the void distortion and \n\nvoid sheet coalescence mechanisms, active at low stress triaxiality. In future research, it \n\nwould be interesting to extend the CPB06 damage model to incorporate the void shearing \n\ndamage effects. This could be performed in a similar manner to how Gurson's (1977) criteria \n\nhas been extended, meaning that the same approach can be used to include also strain-rate \n\ndependency and temperature sensitivity. Another interesting topic for future work would be \n\nto perform a sensitivity analysis including the matrix anisotropic behaviour. The numerical \n\ntools developed within this work are equally prepared to study this sounder case. Such \n\nanalysis involves a higher number of interdepend coefficients, hence the knowledge acquired \n\nfor the isotropic case, i.e. the developed know-how, will prove to be an excellent basis for \n\nthe study of this more complex case. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Bibliography \n\n \n\n \n\nJo\u00e3o Paulo Martins Brito  81 \n\n \n\nBibliography \n\n \n\nAlves, J.
