The current work aims to determine the most suitable BC modification method \n\nto obtain an effective drug delivery membrane through electric stimulus. Thus, the BC/PANi \n\nnanocomposites were synthesized through the employment of different BC matrixes \n\n(drained, freeze dried and regenerated), as well as through different polymerization methods \n\n(in situ and ex situ). Prior to modification, the effects of both drying methods (freeze drying \n\nand oven drying), and regeneration process on BC structure were studied. By freeze drying \n\nBC, the fibril network is preserved, leading to a more porous material. On the other hand, \n\nregenerated BC presented a compact surface due to the incapacity to reorganize into fibrils \n\nduring the regeneration process. This way, freeze dried BC should be more suited for \n\nmodification. To obtain a highly conductive nanocomposite, the in situ polymerization on \n\ndrained BC should be employed. The introduction of PANi onto BC obstructed the pores, \n\nwhich led into a more compact and rougher material. Also, a decrease in the thermal stability, \n\nas well as a decrease in the BC crystallinity was observed. The nanocomposites were drug \n\nloaded with sodium sulfacetamide to evaluate the antimicrobial activity. It was observed that \n\nwithout electrical stimulus, only drug loaded drained in situ BC/PANi nanocomposite \n\npresented an inhibitory effect onto the Escherichia coli (E. coli) growth (13%). By applying \n\nelectric stimulus onto this membrane, the inhibition in E. coli growth is further evidenced \n\n(20%). This way, in situ polymerization of aniline on drained BC presented to be an effective \n\nmethod to create a highly conductive membrane for drug release through electrical stimulus.  \n\n  \n\nKeywords: Bacterial cellulose, Polyaniline, cellulose modification, antimicrobial activity, \n\nelectrical stimulus, inverse gas chromatography \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nV \n \n\nResumo \n\n \n\n Os nanocomp\u00f3sitos de celulose bacteriana/polianilina (CB / PANi) t\u00eam recebido nos \n\n\u00faltimos tempos um grande interesse por parte da comunidade cient\u00edfica para o \n\ndesenvolvimento de aplica\u00e7\u00f5es eletr\u00f3nicas. Este trabalho tem como objetivo determinar o \n\nm\u00e9todo de modifica\u00e7\u00e3o mais adequado da CB para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de uma membrana eficaz na \n\nliberta\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00e1rmacos atrav\u00e9s de est\u00edmulo el\u00e9trico. Assim sendo, os nanocomp\u00f3sitos \n\nCB/PANi foram sintetizados utilizando diferentes matrizes de CB (drenada, liofilizada e \n\nregenerada) bem como atrav\u00e9s de diferentes m\u00e9todos de polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o (in situ e ex situ). Antes \n\nda modifica\u00e7\u00e3o, foram estudados os efeitos tanto do m\u00e9todo de secagem (liofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nsecagem no forno) como tamb\u00e9m o processo de regenera\u00e7\u00e3o na estrutura da CB. O processo \n\nliofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o levou \u00e0 preserva\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura tridimensional, obtendo assim um material mais \n\nporoso. Por outro lado, a CB regenerada apresentou uma superf\u00edcie compacta devido \u00e0 \n\nincapacidade de reorganizar-se em fibrilas durante o processo de regenera\u00e7\u00e3o. Desta forma, \n\na CB liofilizada aparenta ser a matriz mais adequada para modifica\u00e7\u00e3o. Contudo, \n\nrelativamente aos diferentes nanocomp\u00f3sitos obtidos, para se obter uma membrana com \n\nelevada condutividade, o m\u00e9todo mais adequado \u00e9 a polimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o in situ na CB drenada. A \n\nintrodu\u00e7\u00e3o de PANi na CB obstruiu os poros, levando \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de um material mais \n\ncompacto e rugoso. Tamb\u00e9m foi observado uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na estabilidade t\u00e9rmica bem \n\ncomo uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na cristalinidade da CB. A sulfacetamida de s\u00f3dio foi incorporada \n\nnos nanocomp\u00f3sitos para avaliar a atividade antimicrobiana onde, sem est\u00edmulo el\u00e9trico, \n\napenas o nanocomp\u00f3sito in situ com CB drenada apresentou um efeito inibit\u00f3rio sobre o \n\ncrescimento de Escherichia coli (E. coli) (13%). Atrav\u00e9s da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de est\u00edmulo el\u00e9trico sobre \n\nesta membrana, a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o no crescimento de E. coli \u00e9 potenciado (20%). Assim sendo, a \n\npolimeriza\u00e7\u00e3o in situ da anilina numa membrana drenada mostrou ser eficaz na liberta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo f\u00e1rmaco por est\u00edmulo el\u00e9trico. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: celulose bacteriana, polianilina, modifica\u00e7\u00e3o da celulose, atividade \n\nantimicrobiana, est\u00edmulo el\u00e9trico, cromatografia gasosa inversa \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nVII \n \n\nIndex \n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline \n\ncomposites for potential drug delivery application ...........................................................

Introduction \n\n  \n\n1.1 \u2013 Cellulose \n\n \n\n Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer found in nature, being produced by plants, \n\ntunicates, algae and some bacteria (1). In plants, this polymer is associated with \n\nhemicellulose and lignin, and in order to obtain pure cellulose it requires harsh chemical \n\n(alkali or acid) treatment (2). Bacterial cellulose (BC) is the most pure form of cellulose found \n\nin nature, where it does not have any of the aforementioned impurities present in plant \n\ncellulose (3). \n\n From a chemical point of view, cellulose is a homopolymer consisting of glucose \n\nmonomers linked by ?\u20131,4 glucosidic bonds in such a way that one monomer is rotated 180\u00ba \n\nrelative to the other (2). It also possesses three hydroxyl groups per monomer, which gives \n\ncellulose a highly hydrophilic behaviour (4). This confers to cellulose the ability to interact \n\nvia inter\u2013 and intra\u2013 hydrogen bonding, resulting in a biomaterial with high crystallinity \n\nindex and high tensile strength (4). In case of BC, due to the small fibre diameter of cellulose, \n\nthe overall material presents high surface area and high porosity (5). BC also possesses a high \n\nthermal stability and biocompatibility (6).  \n\nCellulose structures present highly ordered (crystalline) and disordered (amorphous) \n\nregions and it possesses four different polymorphs named cellulose I, II, III and IV (1, 7, 8). \n\nCellulose I is found in nature and can be either converted in cellulose II or III (1, 7). Cellulose \n\nII can be obtained either through mercerization or through regeneration (dissolution and \n\nrecrystallization) (1, 7). Cellulose III can be obtained from cellulose I or II through liquid \n\nammonia treatments and then by applying thermal treatment it can convert into cellulose IV \n\n(1, 7). Additionally, cellulose I possess two distinct structures: I? and I?, which coexist and \n\ntheir proportion depends on the cellulose source (8, 9). Cellulose I? is the dominant structure \n\nfor most algae and bacteria whereas cellulose I? is dominant in plants and tunicates (9). The \n\nmain difference between I? and I? is the stacking of cellulose chains throughout the plane, \n\nhaving a triclinic and a monoclinic crystal system respectively (Figure 1). \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Schematic representation of cellulose I? (-), I? (-) crystalline structures (based from (10)). \n\n \n\n1.1.1 \u2013 Bacterial cellulose  \n\n \n\n Bacterial cellulose (BC) was first discovered by Adrian J. Brown through the \n\nevaluation of the fermentation of \u201cmother vinegar\u201d, which produced a \u201cjelly\u2013like translucent \n\nmass on the surface of the culture fluid; this growth rapidly increases until the whole surface of the liquid \n\nis covered with a gelatinous membrane, which, under very favourable circumstances, may attain a \n\nthickness of 25 mm\u201d (11).  \n\nIn order for BC biosynthesis to occur, glucose found in culture media is uptaken by \n\nglucose permeases found in cell membranes (12). Afterwards it is converted into glucose\u20136\u2013\n\nphosphate by glucokinase in order to trap glucose inside the cell and to facilitate its \n\nmetabolism (13). Through phosphoglucomutase, the phosphate group is shifted from carbon \n\n6 to carbon 1, that can be converted into UDP\u2013glucose by UDP\u2013glucose phosphorylase (5, \n\n14). In this activated form, glucose is now able to be used by cellulose synthase for BC \n\nproduction (5, 14). Moreover, other sugars can be used as a carbon source for cellulose \n\nproduction, such as fructose, galactose, mannose, among others (15).  \n\nCellulose chains are formed by the polymerization of glucose by cellulose synthase, \n\nfound in cell membranes (16). These chains are extruded to the culture medium, forming \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\nnanofibrils. The fibrils further aggregate with each other, creating a ribbon\u2013like structure \n\n(Figure 2) (17). BC fibrils are about 100 times thinner than plant cellulose, resulting in a \n\nhighly porous material (5). This biopolymer has a structural role in cellulose\u2013producing \n\nbacteria, which confers mechanical, chemical or biological protection within the \n\nenvironment, as well as a functional role by aiding in the competition for substrates (14, 18). \n\nAlso it protects the bacteria from UV radiation, improves nutrient transport via diffusion and \n\nprotects the bacteria from heavy metals (18). \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Schematic representation of BC assembly (based from (19)). \n\n \n\n Due to these remarkable properties, BC can be used in different areas, such as food \n\n(20) and pharmaceutical  industry (17). For instance, in the Philippines, Nata de coco is a \n\npopular snack which consists in the fermentation of coconut water by Acetobacter xylinum \n\n(18). In biomedicine, many patents were made involving BC, such as for artificial blood \n\nvessels, skin tissue and bone tissue repair, scaffold matrix, antibacterial masks, among others \n\n(16). Biofill\u00ae is a product of BC used to treat second and third degree burns, as a temporary \n\nsubstitute for human skin (21). There are several advantages regarding the use of this product \n\nsuch as immediate pain relief, close adhesion to the wound bed, reduced infection rate, faster \n\nhealing and reduced treatment time and costs (21). Sony Corp. marketed loudspeakers and \n\nheadphones with BC employed, having lower harmonic distortions when compared to \n\nconventional paper (22).  \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nMoreover, BC can also incorporate polymerizable monomers into its network, \n\noccupying its void volume and interacting with the BC fibre chains (23). Researchers exploit \n\nthis property in order to change and/or improve the characteristics of BC such as its \n\nhydrophobicity, electrical conductivity, surface reactivity, mechanical and thermal \n\nresistance, among others (23). In the following section, cellulose modification mechanisms \n\nduring cellulose regeneration, as well as through in situ and ex situ chemical polymerization \n\nwill be presented. \n\n \n\n1.2 \u2013 Cellulose modification  \n\n \n\nTo improve and give new properties to cellulose sometimes requires chemical \n\nmodifications. In order to obtain a homogeneous substitution all hydroxyl groups should be \n\navailable, but in native cellulose such does not happen due to the packing of chains (24). To \n\novercome this problem, cellulose can be dissolved by disrupting the intra\u2013 and inter\u2013 \n\nmolecular interaction in cellulose (24).  \n\nCellulose modification can also be achieved through in situ polymerization which \n\nconsists in the polymerization of a monomer in the presence of a filler matrix (BC membrane) \n\n(25). This technique allows the filler to preserve its shape as also attain improved dispersion \n\nand higher filler\u2013matrix interaction (25).The polymerization can be categorized between in \n\nsitu and ex situ, meaning it occurs inside or outside of BC, respectively. Several researchers \n\nreport the use of in situ polymerization, such as Hu et al. (26), Wang et al. (27), Lee et al. \n\n(28), Shi et al. (23) and Park (29). In these works, the monomer is incorporated inside of the \n\nmatrix. This polymerization method allows a uniform dispersion of the monomer into the \n\nBC matrix which minimizes the aggregation of polymer\u2013polymer molecules, increasing the \n\ninteraction between BC and the growing polymer molecules (23, 26-30). The main limitations \n\nof this polymerization route are that it is only applicable when the polymerization takes place \n\nin liquid phase and that it is difficult to disperse hydrophobic monomers into the BC due to \n\nits hydrophilicity (30). In ex situ polymerization the dispersion of the monomer inside of BC \n\nprior to the polymerization is absent, which can cause a poor bonding between the organic \n\nmatrix and the polymer (30).  \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nThe current work consists in the modification of BC through the polymerization of \n\naniline during the regeneration process as also through in situ and ex situ polymerization. In \n\nthe literature, it can be found the importance of the drying method for the properties of the \n\nBC membrane in terms of its morphology, crystallinity and swelling ability (31-33). However, \n\nit has not yet been studied the effect of using different BC matrixes for the nanocomposites \n\nsynthesis. Thus, one of the main focus of this work will be the study of the BC matrix onto \n\nthe synthesis of the BC/PANi nanocomposite. \n\n \n\n1.2.1 \u2013Cellulose dissolution \n\n \n\n Intermolecular forces, molecular weight, crystallinity and polar groups that may take \n\npart in hydrogen bonding, play an important role in the solubility and reactivity of polymers \n\n(24). In cellulose, due to the organization of the network makes it insoluble in water and \n\nmany other solvents (34). The key to successfully dissolve cellulose lies in the ability to \n\ndisrupt the hydrogen bonds, isolating the chains from each other (35). This is possible if the \n\nsolvent system used overcomes the intermolecular forces established between cellulose \n\nchains, eliminating the cellulose supramolecular structure (35). This treatment gives a simple \n\npathway to transform cellulose into other forms such as fibers, membranes, beads, hydrogels, \n\netc. (36, 37). The development of new solvent systems to create regenerated cellulose is \n\nfuelled by the increasing interest in novel techniques suitable for shaping homogeneous \n\nchemical modifications.  \n\nThe first process of cellulose dissolution was discovered by Christian Sch\u00f6nbein, in \n\n1846 (38). It was discovered by accident when the researcher spilled a mixture of nitric and \n\nsulfuric acids and cleaned with a cotton apron where afterwards placed near fire to dry, where \n\nit ignited almost instantly (39). This happened due to the nitration of OH groups of cellulose \n\n(substituted by NO2 from nitric acid) creating cellulose nitrate (39). It is highly flammable \n\nand when heated it releases as much as three times more energy than gunpowder and \n\nproduces far less smoke, being later on used in explosives (39). What made this material \n\ninteresting is the fact that it can be dissolved, unlike native cellulose (38). The first studies \n\nregarding cellulose dissolution were made with plant cellulose, being later on also applied \n\nonto BC (34, 40, 41). \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n Cellulose solvent systems can be categorized into non\u2013derivatizing and derivatizing \n\nsolvents (38). Non\u2013derivatizing solvents implies that the solvent does not establishes covalent \n\nbonds with cellulose, only directly dissolving the polymer (24, 42). On the other hand, \n\nderivatizing solvents react with cellulose, changing its moiety in such a way that it breaks the \n\nhydrogen bonds (24, 42).  \n\nOne main problem regarding the dissolution of cellulose is the use of hazardous, \n\ncorrosive or non\u2013degradable solvents which hinders the dissolution process to be used in a \n\nlarger scale. Also, the dissolution procedure is time consuming, being one of the reasons not \n\nto be used outside laboratory scale conditions. Quite a few liquids are able to swell cellulose \n\nbut not able to dissolve it (24). Despite the difficulties regarding cellulose dissolution, there \n\nis a handful of solvent systems that can successfully do it. The most known solvent systems \n\nare dimethylacetamide/LiCl (DMAc/LiCl), NaOH/urea/water, N\u2013methylmorpholine \n\noxide (NMMO) and ionic liquids (40, 41, 43-46). In the current work, it will be used \n\nDMAc/LiCl for BC dissolution. \n\n DMAc/LiCl is the most frequently used solvent systems to dissolve plant cellulose. It \n\nwas first patented by McCormic in the 1981 (44), being highly efficient in dissolving high \n\nmolecular weight cellulose with negligible chain degradation (24, 47). This solvent system \n\nseems to be very specific when it comes to the interaction with cellulose (24). In other words, \n\nneither DMAc with other lithium salts nor DMAc with other chloride salts seem to work in \n\nthe same way as DMAc/LiCl (24). The dissolution mechanism proposed by McCormic (44) \n\nconsists on the hydroxyl groups of cellulose interaction with Cl\u2013 via hydrogen bonding while \n\nLi+ is solvated by DMAc (Figure 3). For this interaction to take place, no water can be present. \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Schematic representation of the interactions established between cellulose and DMAc/LiCl (based from \n\n(48)). \n\n This solvent system is colourless and enables the investigation of dissolved cellulose \n\nby 13C\u2013NMR, size exclusion chromatography and light scattering techniques (38). Also, \n\nmany reports were made regarding the electrospinning of cellulose using this solvent system \n\n(49-53). According to Li et al. (49) and Frenot et al. (50), there are some difficulties due to \n\nthe concentration of cellulose and ions present in the solvent. Using low concentrations of \n\ncellulose it may occur electrospraying, forming particles instead of fibers (49). On the other \n\nhand, using high concentrations of cellulose it may obstruct the electrospinning due to the \n\nviscosity of the solution (49).  \n\n \n\n1.2.2 \u2013 Intrinsically Conductive Polymers  \n \n\nIn 1977, the discovery of conductive polyacetylene was the starting point for \n\nresearchers to find a new whole class of conductive materials: conjugated polymers (54). It \n\nled to the discovery of polyaniline (PANi), polypyrrole, polythiophene, among others (55). \n\nIn 2000, a group of scientists who had discovered and studied conductive polyacetylene were \n\nawarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (56). Nowadays, the unique properties of these \n\npolymers makes them suitable for applications such as thin film transistors, supercapacitors, \n\nengineering scaffolds, implantable biosensors and implantable neural prosthetic devices (23, \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n57, 58). In the current work PANi will be used for the synthesis of BC conductive \n\nnanocomposites. \n\n Intrinsically conductive polymers (ICP) possess a conjugated ?\u2013electron backbone \n\n(Figure 4) which exhibits unusual electronic properties such as low ionization potentials and \n\nhigh electron affinities (59). In the case of PANi, an amine group is found between the \n\naromatic rings (Figure 4A) which should not present a polyconjugation system and therefore \n\nno conductivity. In order to assure polyconjugation, the lone pair of electrons from nitrogen \n\nparticipates in the ?\u2013electron backbone, giving the conductive properties (57). The electrical \n\nconductivity is possible when the electrons are able to move from one end of the polymer to \n\nanother (55, 60). This property is closely related to the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, as \n\ndepicted in Figure 4B. The lower the energy gap between these two orbitals, the easier it is \n\nfor the electrons to flow through the material, conferring conductive properties (55). \n\nAlthough, polyconjugation alone is not possible to turn the polymer conductive. The \n\noxidation of the material is required, creating \u201choles\u201d in the HOMO orbitals, where an \n\nelectron is missing. Neighbouring electrons can fill that position but they will create a new \n\nhole, and by repeating the process, it allows the charge to migrate long distances (61). The \n\noxidation is possible by adding an acid to the reaction media (chemical oxidation), where the \n\nN radical is compensated by the counter ion of the acid (X-). In the current work, the counter \n\nion will be chlorine since the reaction will be in the presence of HCl. ICP are commonly \n\nobtained through either electro\u2013 or oxidative\u2013polymerization (62). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Schematic representation of doped PANi ?\u2013system (A) and diagram demonstrating the energy gap \n\n(Eg) between metal, semiconductor and isolators (B) (based from (55)). X- \u2013 anion that interacts with the \n\npositively charged groups of PANi. \n\n \n\nChemical oxidation occurs through the formation of covalent bonds between the \n\nmonomer molecules at the expense of losing two protons with the aid of an oxidizing agent \n\n(57). Unlike radical oxidation, it requires large amounts of oxidizing agents since it is spent \n\nin every step of the chain\u2013growth polymerization (57). In order for the polymerization \n\nprocess to occur, an oxidation potential of at least +1.05 V is required (57, 63). As such, \n\npersulfates are one of the most used oxidizing agents, which have an oxidation potential of \n\n+2.01 V (57). The properties of ICP synthesized via chemical oxidation are influenced by the \n\nreaction conditions, namely the chemical nature of the oxidants protonating acid, the \n\nconcentration of the reactants (especially their molar stoichiometry), reaction temperature, \n\ntemplates added to the reaction mixture, among others (64). \n\n PANi is one of the most used ICP due to its low\u2013cost, stability in aggressive chemical \n\nenvironments, non\u2013toxicity and low manufacturing cost (57, 64). The polymer depicts a \n\n\u201chead\u2013to\u2013tail\u201d configuration (Figure 5), which consists in para\u2013substituted aniline monomer \n\nunits coupled with each other (57, 65). The monomer aniline consists in a phenyl group \n\nattached to an amine group (Figure 5).  \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Reaction mechanism representation of aniline polymerization through chemical oxidation (based \n\nfrom (57)). APS \u2013 ammonium persulfate. Polyaniline has three forms: leucoemeraldine (if x equals to 0), \n\nemeraldine (if x equals to 0.5) and pernigraniline (if x equals to 1). \n\n \n\n Aniline (ANi) is easily oxidized due to its pronounced electron donor ability (57).  \n\nDepending on the reaction conditions, it is possible to obtain PANi with different oxidation \n\nstates. This polymer has three forms: a fully reduced (leucoemeraldine), half oxidized \n\n(emeraldine) and fully oxidized (pernigraniline), as seen in Figure 5. The reaction mechanism \n\n(Figure 5) encompasses three steps: the induction period followed by the chain propagation \n\nperiod and then the chain termination (57). In the induction period, the amine group in \n\naniline is oxidized, generating a radical which reacts with another aniline molecule, resulting \n\nin a dimer. By further oxidizing the amine ends, the chain grows until either one of the \n\nreactants is depleted.  \n\n Several papers have reported BC/PANi nanocomposites, through different \n\npolymerization methods, obtaining a wide range of conductivity values, ranging between \n\n1.61x10\u20134 and 5.1 S/cm (23, 26-29, 66-68). These conductivity values falls into the category \n\nof semiconductive range (10\u20137 and 100 S/cm) (58).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n1.3 \u2013Inverse Gas Chromatography  \n\n \n\n The synthesis of new nanocomposites is of great importance, where it is explored new \n\nbehaviours and functionalities beyond the starting materials (69). An array of advancements \n\ninto functionalizing BC are presented in the literature, with the intent to create new BC \n\nnanocomposites (1, 70). These new materials need to be extensively characterized in order \n\nto give an insight in the properties obtained so that it can be designated into a potential \n\napplication (69).    \n\n  With the incorporation of PANi into the BC matrix, it is expected several changes \n\nto the starting material due to the changes in the established intermolecular forces. Thus, \n\ninverse gas chromatography (IGC) will be used, which will give us valuable information \n\nregarding changes in the surface moiety, pore availability and surface energy sites. Due to \n\nthe relevance of this technique in the current work, the theoretical background will be further \n\ndiscussed. \n\nIGC has been applied in the last years as a reliable source of physicochemical data for \n\nmany non\u2013volatile materials (71). It consists in the injection of probe molecules (specific \n\nmolecules with known properties), under controlled experimental conditions, in order to \n\nobtain certain properties of the material (72). The term \u201cinverse\u201d is applied since, unlike \n\nconventional gas chromatography (GC), the material of interest is placed in a \n\nchromatographic column, acting as a stationary phase (73).  \n\nApplying this technique offers some advantages, such as its sensitivity and \n\nreproducibility, it requires low amount of material, can be run at a wide range of temperatures \n\nand it does not require pure solutes (72, 74). Additionally, unlike contact angle technique, in \n\nIGC the material does not require a previous treatment on the surface (75). For instance, in \n\norder to study powders via contact angle technique its necessary its compression, which \n\nresults in surface morphology modifications (76).  \n\nThis technique can be applied into a wide range of materials, from organic (such as \n\npolymers and pharmaceuticals) (77) to inorganic (such as silica and other minerals) (78).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n1.3.1 \u2013 IGC instrumentation \n \n\n In sum, IGC consists in a mass flow controller; two ovens: one for the solute reservoir \n\nand one for the column with the packed sample; a detector and a computer (Figure 6). \n\nHelium is used as the carrier gas since it is inert, avoiding interactions with the column and \n\nthe adsorbate. Adsorbate\u2013adsorbate interactions are neglected when tests are conducted at \n\ninfinite dilution, where the amount of probe injected is near the limit of detection of the \n\ndetector (79). At infinite dilution, the probe molecules only interact with the most energetic \n\nactive sites, following the Henry Law\u2019s region (79). In that region, one should expect a \n\nsymmetrical Gaussian peak and therefore a linear isotherm (80). \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Schematic representation of the inverse gas chromatographer apparatus. \n\n \n\nIGC is equipped with two detectors: flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal \n\nconductivity detector (TCD). Compared to TCD, FID is better suited under infinite dilution \n\ntests since it has a higher sensitivity, up to 10\u20139 mol (81). Both detectors can detect organic \n\nmolecules while FID, unlike TCD, cannot detect water (81).   \n\n In chromatography, retention time (tR) is commonly used in order to characterize each \n\npeak, although it changes considerably according to the experimental conditions (namely \n\ncarrier gas flow rate and the pressure drop in the column). The latter parameter is of great \n\nimportance since in chromatography the volume of the gas changes when it crosses the \n\ncolumn, due to its compressibility property (82). The James\u2013Martin compressibility factor (j) \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\ntakes in account the inlet and outlet pressure of the carrier gas in the column, correcting the \n\npressure variations along the run (82). \n\nRetention volume (VN) considers the aforementioned parameters, offering more \n\nreliable and reproducible results (83). Adapting to IGC, VN can be defined as the volume of \n\nthe mobile phase that left the column during the time the adsorbate was interacting with the \n\nanalyte. This way, VN can be used as a reference parameter since it is affected by the \n\ninteractions between the adsorbate and the sample (83). Further parameters can be taken into \n\nconsideration, such as the temperature and the sample mass (77). This way, the values of VN \n\nare normalized, being now called specific retention volume (Vg), providing comparable \n\nresults (84).  It can be deducted from the following equation (1): \n\n \n\nVg=\nF.j\n\nm\n.(tR\u2013t0).\n\n273.15\n\nT\n (1)\n\n   \n\nwhere F is the carrier gas flow; m the sample mass; tR and t0 the retention time of the \n\nadsorbate and the inert reference gas respectively and T the absolute temperature. \n\n \n\n1.3.2 \u2013 Surface energy \n \n\n1.3.2.1 \u2013 Dispersive component  \n \n\n  The surface of a solid is composed of free bonding functional groups, establishing an \n\ninterface with the surrounding environment. An important surface parameter is its free \n\nenergy, being defined as the energetic difference between the surface and the bulk per unit \n\narea of surface. According to Fowkes, surface energy interactions can be split in dispersive \n\nforces (Van der Waals interactions) and specific forces, such as acid\u2013base, hydrogen bond \n\nand metallic interactions (85). From the injection of a series of n\u2013alkanes, Schultz et al.  \n\ndetermined the dispersive component, by applying the following equation (2) (86): \n\n \n\n?GD=RTln(Vg)=2NA.(?S\nD)\n\n1\n2.am(?L\n\nD)\n1\n2+K (2) \n\n  \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\nwhere ?? ?  is the Gibbs free energy of adsorption of the dispersive component; R the perfect \n\ngas constant; NA Avogadro\u2019s constant; am the cross\u2013sectioned area of the adsorbate; ?S\nD the \n\ndispersive component of the material\u2019s surface energy; ?\nL\nD the probe surface tension and K a \n\nconstant. \n\n From the previous equation, one should obtain a linear trend in the data, usually \n\ndesignated as the alkane line, being the slope equal to 2NA.??S\nD. Basically, a probe with a \n\ncertain am??L\nD will have a given ?? ? which corresponds to the vertical distance between the \n\nx axis and the data plotted (72).  \n\n  \n\n \n\n1.3.2.2 \u2013 Specific component \n \n\n In the case of polar molecules, the free energy of absorption is above the alkane line, \n\nsince both dispersive and specific interactions take place between the surface and the \n\nadsorbate. The latter interaction corresponds to the vertical distance between the polar \n\nadsorbate and the alkane line (72). From the specific free energy of adsorption it is possible \n\nto obtain the surface donor (?S\n?) and acceptor (?S\n\n+) numbers, based on the Good\u2013Van Oss \n\nconcept (87). Experimentally, one should use two probe monopolar molecules: one acid and \n\none basic. This way, it is possible to obtain the parameters indicated above (88) from the \n\nfollowing equation (3): \n\n \n\n?GSP = 2NAam (??S\n??L\n\n+ + ??S\n+?L\n\n?)  (3) \n\n    \n\nwhere ?L\n+ and ?L\n\n? are the acceptor and donor numbers of the adsorbate and ?? ?? the Gibbs \n\nspecific free energy of adsorption. \n\n After obtaining the donor and acceptor numbers of the surface, it is possible to \n\nestimate the specific free energy of adsorption from the following equation, which \n\ncorresponds to the geometric mean of the aforementioned parameters (4): \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n?S\nSP = 2??S\n\n??S\n+ (4) \n\n     \n\n Now with both specific and specific surface energy, it is obtained the total surface \n\nenergy (?S\nTotal), corresponding to the sum of the two components. \n\n \n\n1.3.3 \u2013 Acid-base character through Gutmann Method \n  \n\n Regarding the specific component of the surface, a different approach was taken by \n\nGutmann (89). Similar to the Good\u2013Van Oss method previously described, the adsorbates \n\nalso have reference values, which are obtained experimentally. For the basic component, the \n\ndonor number (DN) is defined as the enthalpy of interaction between the molecule being \n\nstudied and SbCl5 (used as a reference Lewis acid) in 1,2\u2013dichloroethane, a neutral solvent \n\n(79). On the other hand, for the acid component, the acceptor number (AN) was determined \n\nby correlating the induced chemical shifts in 31P NMR spectra of triethylphosphine oxide \n\n(used as a reference Lewis base) dissolved in the acid molecule being studied. Riddle &amp; \n\nFowkes issued that these chemical shifts can be influenced by Van der Waals interactions, \n\nimproving the method by developing modified acceptor numbers (AN*) (90). By doing so, \n\nthe donor and acceptor numbers can be compared and related to surface acidity and basicity \n\nfrom the following equation (5): \n\n \n\n?GSP\n\nAN ?\n=\n\nDN\n\nAN ?\nKa + Kb (5) \n\n  \n\nbeing Ka and Kb acid and basic interaction constants that characterize the polarity of the \n\nsurface. By plotting the results with the previous equation, the slope should correspond to Ka \n\nwhile Kb to the intercept with the Y axis. \n\n \n\n1.3.4 \u2013 Surface nanomorphology \n \n\n Surface nanomorphology gives us an insight about the deviation from a flat surface of \n\na given sample due to the surface asperities, which is correlated to the retention time. Brendle \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\nand Papirer have shown that a given isomer exhibited a lower retention time when compared \n\nto the corresponding linear alkane probe (91). In fact, the retention time can be either shorter \n\ndue to the steric hindrance of the branched alkane probes to access the surface pores or longer \n\nif the probes can be inserted in the pores (91). The size exclusion effect is related not only \n\nfrom the surface morphology but also due to the molecular shape (92). In this study, n\u2013octane \n\nisomers such as 2,5\u2013dimethylhexane, 2,2,4\u2013trimethylpentane and cyclooctane were used. \n\nThe nanomorphology index is determined by the following equation (6): \n\n \n\nMorphology index = e\n??Ga\n\nM\n\nRT  (6)\n\n  \n\nwhere ???\n? corresponds to the distance between the probe and the alkane line. If the \n\nmorphology index is lower than 1 it indicates that the probe had steric hindrance with the \n\nsurface of the material whereas values higher than 1 indicate the probe insertion into the \n\npores. Thus, the closer the morphology index is to 1 it means that the given isomer behaves \n\nlike the corresponding linear alkane, where it is considered that the surface is flat (92). \n\n \n\n1.3.5 \u2013Surface area  \n \n\nSurface area (SBET) of materials are commonly obtained from the Nitrogen adsorption \n\nisotherm at 77K, using the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) equation (93). This method is \n\nbased on the relationship between the amounts of gas adsorbed at different gas pressures, at \n\na fixed temperature T.  After a certain amount of gas pressure, the amount of gas adsorbed \n\nreaches a plateau, physically corresponding to the monolayer capacity (nm). IGC can \n\nevaluate these parameters, therefore being possible to determine the surface area. The original \n\nequation applied by Brunauer et al. is linearized (7), which is possible to obtain the \n\nmonolayer capacity from the slope and the intercept. \n\n \n\np\n\nn(p0 ? p)\n=\n\nc ? 1\n\nnmc\n\np\n\np0\n+\n\n1\n\nnmc\n (7) \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nbeing p0 the gas pressure, p the adsorbate pressure, nm the monolayer capacity, n the amount \n\nof probe adsorbed and c a constant. \n\n If the area of the probe used in the BET measurements is known, it\u2019s possible to obtain \n\nthe BET surface area (SBET) by the following equation (8): \n\n \n\nSBET  =  anm NA (8) \n\n1.3.6 \u2013 Surface Heterogeneity  \n \n\n Using the sorption isotherm results it\u2019s possible to calculate the adsorption potential \n\ndistribution, which will correspond to the energy profile of the surface (94). Firstly, to obtain \n\nthe distribution function, partial pressures are converted into the adsorption potential (A) \n\nfrom the following equation (9): \n\n \n\nA = RTln (\np\n\np0\n)  (9) \n\n    \n\n Then, the distribution parameter (?) is determined, corresponding to the 1st derivative \n\nof the adsorbed amount with the adsorption potential, which will give us the energy profile \n\nplot.  \n\n \n\n1.3.7 \u2013 Diffusion analysis  \n \n\n In diffusion analysis, different flow rates of mobile gas are used. The principle behind \n\nthis procedure is that as the probe progresses from the inlet to the outlet, it spreads due to \n\ndiffusion phenomena (80). The diffusion coefficient can be obtained from the width of the \n\nelution peak through the equation developed by van Deemter et al. as shown in equation \n\n(10). \n\n \n\n? = ? +\n?\n\n?\n+ ??

The parameters A, B and C are independent of the velocity of carrier gas, related to \n\nthe column, gases and operating conditions respectively (80, 95). The parameter A is called \n\neddy diffusion and is related to the size of support particles and irregularity of packing (96). \n\nThe parameter B describes the longitudinal diffusion of the probe along the stream of carrier \n\ngas (96). The third parameter (C) is related to peak broadening which is due to the mass \n\nresistance within the column (96). Through the constant C it is obtained the diffusion \n\ncoefficient (Dp) through the following equation (11): \n\n \n\n? =\n8\n\n?\n\n?\n\n(1 + ?)2\n?2\n\n??\n (11) \n\n    \n\n where K is the partition ratio and d the film thickness. \n\n \n\n1.3.8 \u2013 Work of adhesion \n \n\n When different solids contact each other, adhesion forces may occur. The intensity of \n\nthe adhesion forces is intimately related to the surface energies of the materials one and two \n\n(97). Work of adhesion (Wadh) is a measure of the strength between two solid surfaces, being \n\ndefined as the free energy required to separate reversibly a unit area of two phases in contact \n\n(98). This means that a higher Wadh value should reflect a stronger interaction between two \n\nmaterials. On the other hand, work of cohesion (Wcoh) is related to the interactions that a \n\nsolid establishes with itself. In the current work the determination of both Wadh and Wcoh will \n\nbe used to estimate the interactions between the membranes and the drug sodium \n\nsulfacetamide. The Wadh will represent the membrane-drug interactions while the Wcoh \n\ncorresponds to the interactions inside the membrane. The former parameter can be calculated \n\nby the following equation (12): \n\n \n\nWadh = 2??S,1\nD . ?S,2\n\nD + 2??S,1\n+ . ?S,2\n\n? + 2??S,1\n? . ?S,2\n\n+  (12) \n\n    \n\nIn the same way, Wcoh can be calculated by the following equation (13): \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n \n\nWcoh = 2??S,1\nD . ?S,1\n\nD + 2??S,1\n+ . ?S,1\n\n? + 2??S,1\n? . ?S,1\n\n+  (13) \n\n \n\nStrzemiecka et al.

Thus, it was presented \n\nthe Wadh/Wcoh ratio, stating that it can be used as an indicator of the degree of the dispersion \n\nof the filler particles into the matrix.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\nAim of the study \n \n\nThe focus of the current work was the use of different BC modifications for the \n\nsynthesis of a conductive BC/PANi nanocomposite with potential for drug delivery through \n\nelectrical stimulus. In this regard, different BC matrixes were used (drained, freeze dried and \n\nregenerated), as well as different aniline polymerization methods (in situ and ex situ), \n\nobtaining different BC/PANi nanocomposites.  \n\nInitially the different BC matrixes were evaluated, regarding the drying method (oven \n\ndried and freeze dried), as well as the regeneration treatments applied. Then, the different BC \n\nmodifications were assessed to evaluate the physico-chemical changes occurred with PANi \n\nincorporation onto BC. Thus, both matrixes and nanocomposites were assessed regarding \n\ntheir structural, morphological and surface characteristics through Fourier transformed \n\ninfrared coupled with attenuated total reflectance (FITR\u2013ATR), scanning electronic \n\nmicroscopy coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), ultraviolet-\n\nvisible (UV\u2013Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA), atomic \n\nforce microscopy (AFM), Swelling, Contact angle measurement and IGC.  \n\nThen, the different nanocomposites were tested in terms of drug loading capacity and \n\nantimicrobial activity studies on Escherichia coli (E. coli) using sodium sulfacetamide as the \n\nreference drug.  \n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nChapter II \u2013 Materials and methods \n\n \n\n The BC matrixes and the nanocomposites synthesized in this work were subjected to \n\na series of analyses to fully characterize the materials, obtaining an insight of the changes \n\noccurred during the drying and regeneration treatments, as well as due to the incorporation \n\nof PANi onto BC.  \n\n \n\n2.1 \u2013 BC production \n\n \n\n Gluconacetobacter sp. was statically cultivated in Hestrin and Schramm (HS) medium \n\n(previously autoclaved during 15 min at 121 \u00baC) in order to meet the bacteria cellular \n\nrequirements for cellulose production. The composition of the HS medium can be found \n\nelsewhere (100). After being incubated for 7 days at 30 \u00baC, the membrane was removed and \n\nwashed with NaOH 0.5 M, at 80 \u00baC during 2 h, and then neutralized with distilled water. \n\nThe membrane was stored at 5 \u00baC until further use. \n\n The BC membranes were oven dried (OD\u2013BC) and freeze dried (FD\u2013BC) in order to \n\nevaluate the drying effect and later on the influence of the matrix in the polymerization of \n\naniline. Then, OD\u2013BC was used to obtain regenerated BC (R\u2013BC).  \n\n \n\n2.2 \u2013 BC dissolution optimization \n\n \n\n Prior to dissolution, OD\u2013BC was placed on an Erlenmeyer. DMAc was added to \n\nobtain a BC concentration of 0.5% (w/v). Likewise, LiCl was added to obtain a percentage \n\nof 8% (w/v). These proportions were based on the work published by Li et al. (49). Different \n\nparameters were considered for the optimization of the dissolution procedure, which are \n\nfound in Table 1 in the same order as they were applied. Swollen samples were left static \n\novernight at room temperature. Heat\u2013treated samples were placed in an oil bath at 110 \u00baC \n\nduring 1 h. An ultrasonic bath Ultrasons\u2013H (Selecta) was applied during 1 h at room \n\ntemperature for the ultrasound\u2013assisted solutions. \n\n  \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Dissolution parameters tested on BC dissolution. \n\nCut \nSwelling in  \n\nDMAc \n\nSwelling in  \n\nDMAc/LiCl \nHeat Ultrasounds \n\nStirring \n\novernight \nObservation \n\n   x  x Swelling \n\nx   x  x Swelling \n\nx x  x  x Swelling, loss of white colour \n\nx x  x x x Dissolution \n\nx  x x x x Dissolution \n\n \n\n In order to confirm that BC was fully dissolved, a drop of sample was observed in an \n\nOlympus BX 41 optical microscope coupled with a Moticam 10 camera using the software \n\nMotic Image Plus 2.0. \n\n The regeneration process was employed by adding water gently in the dissolved BC \n\nsolution, leaving under slow stirring (&lt;100 rpm) during 1 h, so that the R-BC gains some \n\nfirmness. Afterwards the samples were washed through dialysis during 72 h using a dialysis \n\ntubing (benzoylated) with a molecular weight cut\u2013off of 2000 Da (Sigma Aldrich). In the end, \n\nthe samples were oven dried at 40 \u00baC. Based on the optimization results, the dissolution of \n\nBC by adding both DMAc and LiCl at the same time was used for future tests. \n\n \n\n2.3 \u2013 BC nanocomposites synthesis  \n\n \n\n For all the studies conducted, the BC nanocomposites were obtained through \n\nchemical oxidative polymerization with 3x3 cm BC membranes and solution reactions \n\n(aniline monomer and ammonium persulfate (APS)), both dissolved in HCl, and purged with \n\nN2 during 30 min prior to polymerization. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was kept under \n\nlow stirring (<100 rpm) at room temperature. After 24 h of polymerization, the membranes \n\nwere washed thoroughly with distilled water until no aggregates of polymer were in solution. \n\nThe nanocomposites were then oven dried overnight at 40 \u00baC and weight out to determine \n\nthe PANi content. The ratios applied in this work are based on the optimization of the \n\nnanocomposites conductivity obtained by Wang et al. (27) with a BC:ANi mass ratio of 0.10 \n\nand molar ratio of Ani:HCl:APS of 1:1.2:1. \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nFor ANi polymerization, three approaches were employed, including in situ and ex \n\nsitu polymerization, as well as a novel method that polymerizes aniline during BC \n\nregeneration. The samples were named according to the type of BC matrix (drained \u2013 no \n\nprefix, freeze dried \u2013 FD, regenerated \u2013 R) and polymerization method (in situ \u2013 IS, ex situ \u2013 \n\nES). The determination of the polymer content in the membranes was determined through \n\nthe following equation: \n\n \n\nPolymer content =  \nwcomposite?wBC\n\nwcomposite\n\u00d7100 (14) \n\n \n\nwhere wcomposite corresponds to the dried weight of the nanocomposite and wBC \n\ncorresponds to the dry weight of BC used for the nanocomposite synthesis. \n\n \n\n2.3.1 \u2013 Synthesis of the nanocomposites through in situ and ex situ \n\npolymerization \n \n\n The BC membranes used in this work were either drained through manual pressure \n\nor freeze dried. In situ polymerization is employed by letting stand during 1 h the monomer \n\nsolution in contact with the membranes prior to addition of the oxidizing agent in order to \n\nincorporate the monomer inside the BC network (Figure 7). For ex situ polymerization, the \n\nincorporation step was absent and the ANi and APS solutions were added simultaneously \n\n(Figure 7). Since the polymerization reaction occurs within the first minutes, the amount of \n\nmonomer incorporated prior to complete polymerization is insignificant.  \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Schematic representation of the methodology employed for in situ and ex situ PANi polymerization. \n\n \n\n2.3.2 \u2013 Synthesis of the nanocomposites during the regeneration of BC \n \n\n The dissolution process employed was the same as previously described, which \n\nconsisted in swelling cut cellulose (0.5% w/v) into DMAc and LiCl (8% w/v) overnight, \n\nfollowed by heating at 110 \u00baC and ultrasound treatment during 1 h each.

Afterwards, the membranes were rinsed \n\ngently in distilled water during 5 min to remove the excess drug on the surface and then oven \n\ndried during 24 h at 40 \u00baC.

The \n\nabsorbance was monitored at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 h after exposure to the \n\nmembranes (2x2 cm) by collecting 1 ml aliquots and measuring in a Genesys 10S \n\nspectrophotometer (Thermoscientific). The control of this experiment consisted in evaluating \n\nthe bacterial growth in the absence of any membrane.

Samples were scanned with the standard Si (silicon) cantilever with a force \n\nconstant of 22 N/m and at a resonance frequency of 325 kHz (tip radius was 10 nm and the \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n29 \n \n\ntip length was 95 \u00b5m), using a scan rate of 1.3 Hz. The surface roughness (Rq) was measured \n\nfrom representative images at 5x5 \u00b5m2 area, which corresponds to the average value of the \n\nsurface height, which can be determined through the following equation (19): \n\n \n\n?? =\n1\n\n?\n?|?

This procedure comprises in the \n\nimmersion of the membranes in distilled water, at room temperature, monitoring their weight \n\nincrease during 48 h. Regarding the weight measurement, the samples were removed from \n\nthe water and their surfaces were carefully wiped with dry filter paper.

The system was \n\nautomatized with the Software SMS IGC Controller v1.8. Silanized glass columns with 3 \n\nmm inner diameter and 300 mm length were used (dimethyldichlorosilane, Repelcote BDH, \n\nUK), packing the sample through vertical tapping. The samples were conditioned overnight \n\nfollowed by 2 h at temperature measurement to stabilize.  \n\nDispersive surface energy measurements were carried using a series of n\u2013alkanes, \n\nfrom n\u2013octane to n\u2013undecane. For specific surface energy measurements, tetrahydrofuran, \n\ndichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and ethanol were used. For the nanomorphology \n\nindex, cyclooctane, 2, 5\u2013dimethylhexane and 2, 2, 4\u2013trimethylpentane were used. In all \n\nprevious analysis, a concentration of 0.2 p/p0 was employed. The isotherm measurements of \n\nn\u2013octane was carried at different concentrations, between 0.05 and 0.2 p/p0.

Thus, \n\nin this section, the effect of BC regeneration and the drying method (freeze dried and oven \n\ndried) on the final BC matrixes properties (structural, morphological, wetting and surface) \n\nwas studied. In addition, the optimization of BC regeneration was made. \n\n \n\n3.1.1 \u2013 BC regeneration \n\n \n\n The dissolution of cellulose has been used as an efficient route for cellulose \n\nmodification (44). In the case of BC, due to the higher degree of polymerization it turns more \n\ndifficult to accomplish a complete dissolution (46). In the current work, the dissolution of \n\nOD-BC was made by using the DMAc/LiCl solvent system, which can be found on the \n\nfollowing subsection.  \n\n DMAc/LiCl solvent system is known for being time consuming essentially due to the \n\nsolvent change process (49, 50, 111-113). Thus, to improve the dissolution procedure, \n\nparameters were considered and evaluated. These included the BC particle size, contact time \n\nwith the solvent prior to activation, and activation of the solvent through heat and ultrasonic \n\ntreatment. \n\n Regarding the particle size, it was seen that large particles would only lead into \n\ncellulose swelling and not dissolution, thus BC was cut into small pieces to increase the \n\ncontact with the solvent. The next attempt was letting BC into contact with DMAc during \n\n24 h and then add LiCl, followed by heating and overnight moderate stirring. This process \n\nalso led to BC swelling, but with a loss of the characteristic white colour of dried BC. By \n\nletting BC in contact with the DMAc, a higher permeation of the solvent was observed, \n\nalthough it was not strong enough to dissolve BC chains. As such, after heat treatment BC \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nwas subjected to ultrasound treatment into the sample where, after 1 hour of continuous \n\nultrasound treatment the BC dispersion into the solution was observed. However, the \n\ndissolution was not complete. Thus, to prompt the full solution of BC, it was left under \n\nmoderate stirring overnight and no suspended particles in solution were observed (Figure \n\n11). Throughout this process, the crucial steps for a successful dissolution of BC are cutting \n\nBC into small pieces, leaving under contact with the solvent overnight, as well as the \n\nultrasonic treatment.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11  \u2013 Dissolution of BC in DMAc/LiCl prior to dissolution (A) and after dissolution(B). \n\n \n\nAlternatively, another experiment was made by keeping BC in contact overnight with \n\nboth the solvent and the salt, where a complete dissolution was also observed (Table 1). To \n\nconfirm the complete dissolution of BC, a drop of partially dissolved and completely \n\ndissolved solutions were observed under the optic microscope (Figure 12). It was only seen \n\ntraces of undissolved cellulose in the optimized process whereas in the unoptimized process \n\n(prior to stirring overnight) significant amounts of undissolved cellulose fibers were found. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Photomicrography (100x) of unoptimized BC dissolution (A) and optimized BC dissolution (B) in \n\nDMAc/LiCl. \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n35 \n \n\n The regeneration process was made by gently adding water into dissolved BC, and left \n\nstatic during one hour to let water permeate R\u2013BC, giving a rigid material. Afterwards, the \n\nmembranes were washed overnight in distilled water and oven dried. The weight of the \n\nsample was higher than the amount of BC added, which indicates that the drying method \n\nwas not efficient to remove the solvent (Li and Cl ions, as well as DMAc). Thus, the \n\nmembranes were washed through dialysis during 3 days to guarantee complete removal of \n\nthe solvent.  \n\n \n\n3.1.2 \u2013 Structural properties \n\n \n\n3.1.2.1 \u2013 Fourier transformed infrared spectrometer coupled to \n\nattenuated total reflectance \n\n \n\n To assess the influence of BC regeneration and drying process on BC structural and \n\nsurface properties, the obtained BC films were analysed by FTIR\u2013ATR. In Figure 13, it is \n\npossible to observe that both OD\u2013BC and FD\u2013BC have the characteristic peaks of cellulose at \n\n3340, 2894, 1632, 1434, 1373, 1312, 1162, 1051, 995, 894 and 666 cm\u20131 (Figure 13). The \n\nstrong and broad band at 3340 cm\u20131 corresponds to the O\u2013H stretching of the hydroxyl \n\ngroups. Sharper peaks on FD\u2013BC are observed, which indicates a more regular structure. \n\nThis is the case of the peak presented at 1107 cm\u20131 that is clearly evident on FD\u2013BC while for \n\nthe remaining BC matrixes this peak is overlaid with the neighbouring peaks. The peaks \n\nobtained at 1632 and 666 cm\u20131, corresponding to the O\u2013H bending and out of plane bending \n\nrespectively (114). The peaks obtained at 2894, 1434, 1373, 1312 and 1051 cm\u20131 correspond \n\nto the CH and CH2 bond vibrations (114). Moreover, there is also a characteristic peak at \n\n1162 cm\u20131, corresponding to the stretching of ether groups (C\u2013O\u2013C), which can be found \n\nwithin the glucopyranose ring and between the glucose monomers (114).  \n\nWhen comparing the FTIR spectra of R\u2013BC with the spectra of OD\u2013BC, the same \n\npeaks are observed, indicating that no chemical changes during the regeneration process of \n\nBC occurred. The absence of other peaks than those from BC, in R\u2013BC sample, shows that \n\nthe dialysis was successfully employed in the solvent remnants removal. However, the slight \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nchanges in the relative intensity of the peaks seem to suggest that a change in the BC crystal \n\nstructure may have occurred.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 FTIR\u2013ATR spectra of oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze dried (FD\u2013BC) and regenerated (R\u2013BC) BC.  \n\n(-) peaks corresponding to O-H bond (-) peaks corresponding to the C-H bonds (-) peaks corresponding to the \n\nC-O-C bonds. \n\n \n\n3.1.2.3 \u2013 X-ray dispersive spectroscopy \n\n \n\nThe XRD spectra is found on Figure 14 and the CI were obtained by applying the \n\nequation developed by Segal et al.

(115), of 75%, Cheng et al. (116), of 85%, and Tsouko et al.(117), of 81%. \n\nFD\u2013BC presented a similar crystallinity index to OD\u2013BC, which indicates that the same BC \n\ncrystallinity is obtained by using both of drying methods. Both OD\u2013BC and FD\u2013BC present \n\na XRD profile of cellulose type I, with characteristic peaks found at 14.5\u00ba, 16.73\u00ba and 22.7\u00ba, \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n37 \n \n\ncorresponding to the (100), (010) and (110) planes, respectively (8, 115).

This is attributed to the rearrangement of the BC chains during the \n\nregeneration process, which led to an increase in the amorphous content (118). Not only the \n\nresulting cellulose matrix presented a lower crystallinity but it was also converted into type \n\nII cellulose, which is corroborated by a peak broadening on XRD as also by a small shift into \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n38 \n \n\nlower 2? values (119). The peaks corresponding to the (110) and (002) are now found at 11.9\u00ba \n\nand 21.0\u00ba respectively (34, 43, 118). The peak broadening on XRD also indicates a lower \n\ncrystallite size, as observed (1.14 nm), due to the amorphous content interference (120). The \n\nZ value for R\u2013BC was not calculated since the equation is suited for cellulose I and the sample \n\npossesses the cellulose II allomorph. The conversion of BC from type I into type II of R\u2013BC  \n\nrelative to OD\u2013BC is supported by the ratio between the absorption at 1370 and 666 cm\u20131 \n\n(A1370/A666), according to Abbot et al. (119), presented on Table 3. It is observed an increase \n\nin the value for R\u2013BC, whereas for FD\u2013BC the value remains nearly constant, when \n\ncompared to the OD\u2013BC.  \n\n \n\n3.1.2.4 \u2013 Thermogravimetrical analysis \n\n \n\nThe thermal behaviour of the BC matrixes is depicted in Figure 15, representing the \n\nmass lost due to thermal degradation. All samples presented a slight mass loss until 125 \u00baC, \n\ncorresponding to the residual moisture content. At higher temperatures, two degradation \n\nregions are observed (280\u2013335 \u00baC and 335\u2013506 \u00baC), in both OD\u2013BC and R\u2013BC, being more \n\npronounced in the former. The presence of the second degradation region is characteristic \n\nwhen TGA is performed under an oxygen atmosphere, due do the extensive formation of \n\nchar at the surface of the sample, which restricts the accessibility of oxygen (121-124). For \n\nFD\u2013BC, a second degradation peak is nearly absent, where most of the sample was degraded \n\non the first region. This could indicate a more regular structure, which corroborates the \n\nincrease of the peaks sharpness on FTIR\u2013ATR of FD\u2013BC in comparison to OD\u2013BC (Figure \n\n13). The residue of the samples was lower than 1%, which means that for R\u2013BC the dialysis \n\nwas effective in the removal of Li+ and Cl\u2013 ions, as well as the initial step in the removal of \n\nthe culture media impurities. \n\n The onset degradation temperature obtained from TGA gives an indication of the \n\nthermal stability of the BC, where lower onset temperatures indicate that the thermal \n\noxidation starts sooner, corresponding to a less stable material (125). Both OD\u2013BC and FD\u2013\n\nBC present a similar onset temperature (300.8 \u00baC for OD\u2013BC and 304.9 \u00baC for FD\u2013BC) \n\nwhich means that they present a similar thermal stability. In case of R\u2013BC a lower onset \n\ntemperature is observed (277.9 \u00baC) which evidences a lower thermal stability.  \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n39 \n \n\ndTGA gives valuable information regarding the thermal degradation profile of the \n\nsamples, where the peak minimum corresponds to the maximum temperature degradation \n\n(Tmax). The main degradation step of oven dried BC presented a Tmax at 335 \u00baC, which is close \n\nto the values found in the literature for other oven dried BC (350\u2013360 \u00baC) (8, 118, 119). For \n\nFD\u2013BC, the Tmax value slightly decreases (3.6%), which indicates that the thermal stability is \n\nsimilar to OD\u2013BC. On the other hand, for R\u2013BC, an evident decrease in the Tmax is observed \n\n(8.4%), which indicates a loss in the thermal stability of the sample. The decrease in both \n\nonset temperature and Tmax value is closely correlated to the crystallinity index of the samples, \n\nwhere a decrease in the crystallinity index is followed by a loss in the thermal stability (8). \n\nFor R\u2013BC such happens because the solvent breaks the hydrogen bonds during the \n\ndissolution and in the regeneration step BC only partially recrystallizes, increasing the \n\namorphous content when compared to the OD\u2013BC, making cellulose more susceptible to \n\nthermal degradation (118). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA and dTGA (inset)) of the oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze dried \n\n(FD\u2013BC) and regenerated (R\u2013BC) BC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n40 \n \n\n3.1.3 \u2013 Morphological properties \n\n \n\n3.1.3.1 \u2013 Scanning electronic microscopy and atomic force microscopy \n\n \n\nThe assessment of the changes at the BC surface through the employment of different \n\ndrying methods and regeneration process was made by SEM and AFM. The SEM \n\nmicrographs of the BC matrixes can be found in Figure 16. Through this figure it is possible \n\nto note that OD\u2013BC presents entangled ribbon\u2013shaped fibrils, producing a network\u2013like \n\nstructure, which agrees with the SEM micrographs found on literature (31, 115, 126). This \n\nstructure confers BC unique properties such as large surface area and high water absorption \n\nability (127). In FD\u2013BC an evident increase in the number of fibrils is observed, which might \n\nbe due to the preservation of its 3\u2013D structure, making FD\u2013BC more porous than OD\u2013BC. \n\nOD\u2013BC is more compact than FD\u2013BC due to the collapse of the pores during oven drying. \n\nIn case of R\u2013BC, a smooth and compact surface is observed, with an absence of fibrils at the \n\nsurface. The same observation was also reported by Lima et al. (34), Chen et al. (126) and \n\nYudianti et al. (115). The most plausible explanation for the compact surface of R\u2013BC is that \n\nduring the regeneration process the BC chain aggregation was too fast, turning BC unable to \n\ncreate an organized structure. \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 16 \u2013 SEM micrographs (3000x) of oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze dried (FD\u2013BC) and regenerated (R\u2013\n\nBC) BC. \n\n \n\n The surface morphology was further explored by AFM (Figure 17), where at a higher \n\nmagnification for OD\u2013BC and FD\u2013BC the fibers can be clearly seen, presenting a width up \n\nto 0.1 \u00b5m. A smoother surface for FD\u2013BC is observed (Rq of 16.2 nm), when compared to \n\nOD\u2013BC (Rq of 25.2 nm). Moreover, the difference in the depth among the surface of the \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n41 \n \n\nsample is more pronounced on OD\u2013BC when compared to FD\u2013BC, which probably led into \n\na rougher surface. This could mean that during the freeze drying process, the 3\u2013D structure \n\nis preserved, whereas by oven drying BC the pores collapse leading to regions with different \n\ndepths. This way, it is evidenced that the processing technique, applied prior to BC \n\nmodification, has influence in its surface morphology. \n\n In case of R\u2013BC it does not present fibers at the surface (Figure 17C, F), which \n\nconfirms the compact nature of the sample. Furthermore, a slight decrease in the roughness \n\nof the surface is observed (Rq of 22.0 nm) which could be correlated to a more constant depth \n\nof the sample.  \n\n \n\nFigure 17 \u2013 3D\u2013and 2D\u2013AFM of oven dried (OD\u2013BC (A, D)), freeze dried (FD\u2013BC (B, E)) and regenerated \n\n(R\u2013BC (C, F)) BC. \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n42 \n \n\n3.1.4 \u2013 Swelling and contact angle analysis \n\n \n\nThe hydrophilic nature and water retention capacity of BC is positively affected by \n\nthe fibril arrangement and high surface area per unit mass (128). To evaluate the rehydration \n\ncapacity of the different BC matrixes, swelling studies were performed as can be seen in \n\nFigure 18. OD\u2013BC presents a steady swell ability until 8 h, reaching a SWmax of 504% (Figure \n\n18, Table 4). For FD\u2013BC, the rehydration ability was greatly enhanced, being statistically \n\ndifferent (p &lt;0.05), probably due to the preservation of the pores during the freeze drying \n\nprocess (Table 4). During oven drying the pores collapse, resulting in a compaction of the \n\nfibers, which is corroborated by the SEM photomicrographs (Figure 16). In case of the R\u2013\n\nBC, the swelling stabilization occurs sooner, presenting a much lower SWmax, of 251%. This \n\nevidences that R\u2013BC has a reduced reabsorption ability due to the compact structure. \n\n \n\nFigure 18 \u2013 Swelling behaviour of oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze dried (FD\u2013BC) and regenerated (R\u2013BC) BC. \n\n \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Swelling maximum (SWmax) and contact angle of oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze dried (FD\u2013BC) and \n\nregenerated (R\u2013BC) BC.  \n\n OD\u2013BC FD\u2013BC R\u2013BC \n\nSWmax (%) 504.0\na 4515.8c 251.4b \n\nContact angle (\u00ba) 47.6 23.7 54.0 \n\nValues in same row not sharing a common superscript are statistically different (p &lt;0.05).  \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n43 \n \n\n In addition to the swell ability, the contact angle measurements were performed for \n\nthe several BC matrixes in order to search for changes in their hydrophilicity (Figure 19). \n\nOD\u2013BC presented a contact angle of 47.6\u00ba, which is higher than the values reported in the \n\nliterature (35.4\u00ba, 36.9\u00ba and 32.5\u00ba) (129-131). FD\u2013BC presented a contact angle much lower \n\n(23.7\u00ba) than the value obtained for OD\u2013BC, which indicates a higher hydrophilic behaviour. \n\nIn contrast, R\u2013BC presented a higher contact angle (54.0\u00ba), indicating an increase in the \n\nhydrophobic behaviour. The contact angle measurement agrees with the swelling maximum \n\nobtained, where the samples with higher contact angle presented lower swelling. A more \n\nhydrophobic behaviour is related to a lower water uptake of the sample. Thus, the \n\nhydrophobicity of the BC samples is the following: R\u2013BC>OD\u2013BC>FD\u2013BC. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19 \u2013 Contact angle analysis of oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze dried (FD\u2013BC) and regenerated (R\u2013BC) \n\nBC. \n\n \n\n3.1.5 \u2013Surface properties by IGC \n\n \n\n To evaluate the effect of the drying method, as well as the regeneration process on the \n\nsurface properties of BC, IGC was employed. Through this technique, the surface energy, \n\nthe acid\u2013base profile and surface nanomorphology were assessed. Regarding the surface \n\nenergy, it was determined both surface components: ??\n?  and ??\n\n??. The acid\u2013base profile was \n\nevaluated through the ???\n??, the Ka and Kb values. For the surface morphology SBET, Dp and \n\nmorphology index were determined. \n\n \n\n3.1.5.1 \u2013 Surface energy \n\n \n\n Papirer et al.

BC surface energy can be found in the literature, where Castro et \n\nal. (133) and Ferguson et al. (134) reported a ??\n? value of 39.6 and 42.3 mJ/m2 at 20 \u00baC and \n\n30 \u00baC respectively. Although, some works that deviate from the previous BC surface energy \n\nvalues, such as by Pommet et al. (135), where a ??\n? value of 61.0 mJ/m2 was obtained. In this \n\nwork, all BC matrixes had a  ??\n? close to the two values mentioned initially.

The number of active sites is seen in the y axis whereas the energy of the active sites \n\n(adsorption potential) is related to the x axis. An increase in the y value corresponds to an \n\nincrease in the number of active sites whereas an increase in the adsorption potential \n\ncorresponds to an increase in the energy of the active sites. Compared with OD\u2013BC, both \n\nFD\u2013BC and R\u2013BC showed a decrease in the ??\n? value of 6.6% and 8.2%, respectively. Both \n\nresults are supported by the heterogeneity profile of n\u2013octane (Figure 20), where it is observed \n\na decrease in the adsorption potential maximum (Amax), meaning the presence of active sites \n\nwith lower energy. Taking OD\u2013BC as a reference, it is observed that by freeze drying and \n\nregenerating BC, the Amax shifts into lower values while presenting a higher number of active \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n45 \n \n\nsites. Thus, it is observed that the drying treatments applied affect the BC chains at the \n\nsurface. \n\n \n\nFigure 20 \u2013 Heterogeneity profile of n\u2013octane on oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze dried (FD\u2013BC) and regenerated \n\n(R\u2013BC) at 25 \u00baC. \n\n  \n\n3.1.5.2 \u2013 Acid\u2013base surface character \n\n \n\nThe injection of polar probes provided information regarding the acid\u2013base properties \n\nof the BC surfaces under study. Differences in the ???\n?? values of the BC matrixes in the polar \n\nprobes were obtained (Figure 21), which indicates that the drying treatments applied on BC \n\ninfluence the polar groups arrangement at the surface. From the Figure 21, OD\u2013BC presented \n\nhigher interactions with all of the studied polar probes, followed by FD\u2013BC and R\u2013BC. This \n\nagrees with the polar surface energy (?s\nSP), which follows the same trend (Table 5). The \n\ndifferent probes have different energies of interaction since each probe interacts differently \n\nwith the BC active sites. Acetonitrile has an amphoteric nature, which interacts with both \n\nacidic and basic groups. This means both acidic and basic groups can be found on the surface \n\nof the BC. \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n46 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 21 \u2013 Specific free energy of adsorption (?GSSP) of the polar probes on oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze dried \n\n(FD\u2013BC) and regenerated (R\u2013BC) BC. \n\n \n\nThe interaction of the surface of BC matrixes with ethanol and tetrahydrofuran gives \n\nan insight about the basic and acid groups present in the surface, respectively. The ratio \n\nbetween these two probes is found in Table 5 (?GS\nSP(Ethanol/Tetrahydrofuran)). In both \n\nFD\u2013BC and R\u2013BC it is observed a decrease more evident in ethanol when compared to THF, \n\nindicating an increase in the acidic behaviour. The overall decrease in the interactions of the \n\npolar probes on R\u2013BC in comparison to OD\u2013BC is corroborated by both THF and EtOH \n\nheterogeneity profiles (Figure 22), which presents a lower amount of surface energy sites, as \n\nwell as lower energy sites (lower Amax value). In case of FD\u2013BC, through the heterogeneity \n\nprofile of both THF and EtOH, the polar probes interacted with a higher amount of surface \n\nenergy sites and at higher energies.  \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n47 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 \u2013 Heterogeneity profile of ethanol (A) and tetrahydrofuran (B) on oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze dried \n\n(FD\u2013BC) and regenerated (R\u2013BC) BC AT 25 \u00baC. \n\n \n\nObserving cellulose chemical structure, it is expected an amphoteric behaviour, with \n\na predominantly acidic character, due to the electron acceptor (H from hydroxyl groups) and \n\nelectron donor (O from glucosidic bonds and hydroxyl groups) groups (136). The Kb/Ka  ratio \n\ngives an indication of the basicity of the sample\u2019s surface, where: (i) a Kb/Ka  higher than 1.1 \n\nindicates a basic surface, (ii) a Kb/Ka  lower than 0.9 indicates a basic surface and (iii) a Kb/Ka \n\nbetween 0.9 and 1.1 indicates an amphoteric surface. OD\u2013BC presented a Kb/Ka of 0.75, \n\nwhich shows an acidic behaviour. Castro et al. (133) reported the same acidic behaviour as \n\nthe obtained OD\u2013BC in the current work (Table 5). Other reports of acidic BC surfaces have \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n48 \n \n\nbeen found in the literature (135). Such phenomenon is observed due to the orientation of \n\nether and hydroxyl groups in the BC surface. In both FD\u2013BC and R\u2013BC the acidic behaviour \n\nis more pronounced (Kb/Ka of 0.57), meaning that there is a higher number of acidic groups \n\navailable in the surface, when compared to the basic groups. This parameter is corroborated \n\nby the ratio between the ?Gs\nSP of EtOH and THF presented in Table 5.  \n\n \n\n3.1.5.3 \u2013 Surface nanomorphology \n\n \n\n As seen above, the drying and regeneration treatments influence the arrangement of \n\nthe BC fibrils. Thus, the surface morphology properties of the BC matrixes were further \n\nexplored by IGC, with the aim to complement the observations previously taken. The SBET \n\nof OD\u2013BC, FD\u2013BC and R\u2013BC were accessed through the isotherms using n\u2013octane as the \n\nprobe (Table 6). OD\u2013BC presents a SBET surface area of 4.59 m\n2/g (Table 6), which is higher \n\nthan the value reported by Castro et al., of 1.94 m2/g (133). By freeze drying, a statistically \n\nsignificant increment (p &lt;0.05) of the SBET surface area is observed which might be due to \n\nthe preservation of the pore structure when compared to oven drying. The preservation of \n\nthe pore structure made easier for probes to cross the sample, thus increasing the Dp value of \n\nFD\u2013BC. The IGC measurements agrees with the SEM micrographs, where it is seen a more \n\nporous material in FD\u2013BC when compared to OD\u2013BC. \n\nAlso, it is observed that OD\u2013BC presents a higher SBET value when compared to R\u2013\n\nBC (Table 6), which might be due to the compact nature of R\u2013BC, as previously suggested. \n\nThis property is corroborated by a lower Dp, which by having a more compact cellulose \n\nnetwork, it takes longer for the probes to cross the sample. The SEM micrograph of R\u2013BC \n\ncorroborates the IGC measurements, where a more compact structure is observed when \n\ncompared to OD\u2013BC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n49 \n \n\nTable 6 \u2013 Surface area (SBET), diffusion parameter (Dp) and morphology indexes of oven dried (OD\u2013BC), freeze \n\ndried (FD\u2013BC) and regenerated (R\u2013BC) BC. \n\nValues in same column not sharing a common superscript are statistically different (p &lt;0.05). The error of the measurements was \n\ndetermined to be 3% and as such the upper and lower values from the average were determined. \n\n  \n\n The interaction of the probes with the surface is not only affected by the surface moiety \n\nof the sample but also by the topography of the surface (92). The morphology index gives the \n\n\u201cdeviation\u201d of the sample surface from being planar, which was assessed with three probes: \n\ntwo branches alkanes (2,5\u2013Dimethylhexane and 2,2,4\u2013Trimethylpentane) and one cyclic \n\nalkane (cyclooctane). In all three matrixes, an adsorption phenomena (morphology index > \n\n1) into the surface is observed for cyclooctane, whereas for the remaining probes a steric \n\nhindrance is depicted (morphology index &lt;1), as displayed by Figure 23. It is important to \n\nhighlight that these differences are related to the volume of the probe. No statistical \n\ndifferences (p &lt;0.05) in the morphology index of 2,5\u2013dimethylhexane were observed, as seen \n\nin Table 6, which indicates that this probe had the same accessibility to the surface in all \n\nsamples, being unable to discern differences in the surface topography. On the other hand, \n\nwith the other probes differences between OD\u2013BC and the remaining BC samples were \n\nobserved. Both probes had an increase in the morphology index in R\u2013BC and FD\u2013BC, which \n\nindicates that the surface of OD\u2013BC is rougher than FD\u2013BC and R\u2013BC.  \n\nThe morphology indexes are in accordance with the AFM results (see in section \n\n3.1.3.1), where it is observed that the surface roughness (Rq) is lower when BC is freeze dried, \n\nwhen compared to the oven drying method. For R\u2013BC, similarly to FD\u2013BC, a decrease in \n\nthe surface roughness is observed through AFM. This way, R\u2013BC obtained a higher \n\nmorphology index when compared to OD\u2013BC.  \n\n In sum, through IGC results it is evidenciated that changes in the surface morphology \n\noccurred in regard to the different drying methods employed, as well through BC \n\nregeneration.

For BC modification, FD\u2013BC was chosen over OD\u2013BC \n\ndue to its increased swelling ability and BC structure preservation. Moreover, in this section, \n\ndrained BC is added for comparative reasons, since BC is commonly modified in this way. \n\nIn this section, a novel BC modification procedure, by using BC regeneration and aniline \n\npolymerization in one-step only, is presented and further discussed. \n\nConductive BC/PANi nanocomposites have been receiving increasing attention from \n\nthe scientific community not only for electronic applications but also for the development of \n\nnovel electro-responsive drug delivery mechanisms. However, despite these recent advances, \n\nthe translation of the different polymerization methods on BC electrical, structural and \n\nsurface properties have not been extensively studied. Thus, different modification methods \n\ncomprising the use of different BC matrixes (drained, freeze dried and regenerated), as well \n\nas different polymerization methods (in situ and ex situ polymerization) were used. The \n\nsamples were named according the type of BC matrix (drained \u2013 D, freeze dried \u2013 FD, \n\nregenerated \u2013 R) and polymerization method (in situ \u2013 IS, ex situ \u2013 ES). \n\n \n\n3.2.1 \u2013 Structural properties \n\n \n\n3.2.1.1 \u2013 Fourier transformed infrared spectrometer coupled to \n\nattenuated total reflectance \n\n \n\nTo confirm the polymerization of aniline onto BC network, FTIR\u2013ATR was \n\nemployed.

The peaks at 1557 and 1128 cm\u20131 correspond to \n\nstretching of the C\u2013N of benzenoid ring while the peaks at 1483 and 1373 cm\u20131 correspond \n\nto the stretching of C=N of the quinoid ring (68).

The peak at 788 cm\u20131 is related to the 1, 4\u2013\n\ndisubstitution of the aromatic ring (138), which is in agreement with the reaction mechanism \n\npresented in Figure 5.  \n\nThe polymerization of aniline onto BC network was confirmed through the \n\ncomparison of pure PANi and nanocomposite spectra (Figure 24) with the respective BC \n\nmatrixes (Figure 13). Through the FTIR\u2013ATR spectra it is possible to observe that the BC \n\nfibers were successfully coated with PANi, which means that both polymerization methods, \n\nas well as the BC matrixes used were viable for the synthesis of BC/PANi nanocomposites. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24 \u2013 FTIR\u2013ATR spectra of PANi and BC/PANi nanocomposites.

In Table 7, that displays the EDX data, it is possible to note several elements such \n\nas C, O, N, S and in some samples Cl were identified. The BC matrixes, prior to modification, \n\npresented only the elements C and O, indicating the absence of impurities. Furthermore. the \n\npresence of PANi on the surface of the nanocomposites is evidenced by the presence of N, \n\nalong with an increase in the C due to the aromatic ring and a decrease on the amount of O, \n\ncorroborating the data obtained from FTIR\u2013ATR and IGC. A similar trend was previously \n\nreported by Shi et al. (2012) and Lee et al. (2012) through XPS, indicating the incorporation \n\nof PANi onto the BC fibers (23, 28). Moreover, the element S can be found on the \n\nnanocomposites due to the persulfate used in the synthesis, in which it is reduced into \n\nsulphate, establishing ionic interactions with the amine groups (23). Also, the presence of Cl \n\nwas expected since the reaction was under a HCl acidic media.  \n\n \n\nTable 7 \u2013 Energy dispersive X\u2013ray spectroscopy data of the BC matrixes and BC/PANi nanocomposites. \n\nSample \nElemental composition (%) \n\nC O N S Cl \n\nOD\u2013BC 52.03 47.97 n.d. n.d. n.d. \n\nFD\u2013BC 59.37 40.63 n.d. n.d. n.d. \n\nR\u2013BC 47.96 52.04 n.d. n.d. n.d. \n\nD\u2013IS 71.15 14.22 10.66 3.97 n.d \n\nFD\u2013IS 70.78 16.94 10.91 1.36 n.d \n\nR\u2013IS 69.46 12.85 8.92 3.53 5.25 \n\nD\u2013ES 68.52 14.81 7.93 8.09 0.66 \n\nFD\u2013ES 73.23 12.03 12.29 2.20 0.25 \n\nn.d \u2013 not detected; OD\u2013BC \u2013 oven dried BC; FD\u2013BC \u2013 freeze dried BC; R\u2013BC \u2013 regenerated BC; D\u2013IS \u2013 drained BC/PANi in situ \n\nnanocomposite; FD\u2013IS \u2013  freeze dried BC/PANi in situ nanocomposite; R\u2013IS \u2013 regenerated BC/PANi nanocomposite D\u2013ES \u2013 drained \n\nBC/PANi ex situ nanocomposite; FD\u2013ES \u2013  freeze dried BC/PANi ex situ nanocomposite.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n54 \n \n\n3.2.1.3 \u2013 X-ray dispersive spectroscopy \n\n \n\nXRD was employed on the BC/PANi nanocomposites to study the effect of the \n\npolymerization of aniline onto BC network (Figure 25). With the introduction of the polymer \n\ninto BC, it were obtained lower crystallinity indexes, when compared to the respective BC \n\nmatrix prior to modification (Table 8). The decrease in the crystallinity index of BC with the \n\npolymerization of PANi was also reported by Wang et al. (28), Marins et al (68), Zhang et \n\nal. (69) and He et al. (152), which might be due to: (i) the introduction of amorphous PANi  \n\nand/or (ii) the weakening of the intermolecular bonds established between the cellulose fibers \n\nin order to interact with the amine groups of polyaniline. Moreover, both drained and  freeze \n\ndried BC/PANi nanocomposites present the characteristic type I cellulose peaks, while R\u2013\n\nIS present type II cellulose, which indicates that no changes in the BC polymorph structure \n\noccurred with the PANi introduction, when compared to the initial matrixes (Figure 14). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 25 \u2013 X\u2013ray diffraction profiles of BC/PANi nanocomposites.

This is observed in both BC \n\nmatrixes (drained and FD\u2013BC), where in situ and ex situ polymerization was applied. On the \n\nother hand, the crystallinity was greatly influenced by the BC matrix used on the \n\npolymerization process. The crystallinity of D\u2013IS and D\u2013ES BC/PANi nanocomposites \n\ngreatly reduces (about 60%), whereas for FD\u2013IS and FD\u2013ES BC/PANi nanocomposites it \n\ndecreases moderately (around 30%) in comparison to the corresponding BC matrix. This \n\nindicates that FD\u2013BC could maintain its initial 3D structure, unlike drained BC. For R\u2013IS \n\nBC/PANi nanocomposite, BC presents a type II cellulose due to the regeneration process, \n\nas discussed in the previous chapter, with a crystallinity index similar to R\u2013BC.  \n\n \n\nTable 8 \u2013 Crystallinity index (CI), and Temperature maximum (Tmax) obtained through XRD and TGA analysis, \n\nrespectively, for the BC matrixes and BC/PANi nanocomposites.  \n\nSample CI (%) Tmax1 (\u00baC) Tmax2 (\u00baC) \n\nOD\u2013BC 79.15 335 - \n\nFD\u2013BC 78.45 323 - \n\nR\u2013BC 47.74 307 - \n\nD\u2013IS 19.48 254 452 \n\nFD\u2013IS 46.22 251 491 \n\nR\u2013IS 50.20 232 444 \n\nD\u2013ES 18.59 254 449 \n\nFD\u2013ES 53.72 276 475 \n\nOD\u2013BC \u2013 oven dried BC; FD\u2013BC \u2013 freeze dried dried BC; R\u2013BC \u2013 regenerated BC; D\u2013IS \u2013 drained BC/PANi in situ nanocomposite; FD\u2013\n\nIS \u2013  freeze dried BC/PANi in situ nanocomposite; R\u2013IS \u2013 regenerated BC/PANi nanocomposite; D\u2013ES \u2013 drained BC/PANi ex situ \n\nnanocomposite; FD\u2013ES \u2013  freeze dried BC/PANi ex situ nanocomposite. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n56 \n \n\n3.2.1.4 \u2013 Thermogravimetrical analysis \n\n \n\nTGA and dTGA were used to study the thermal stability of the nanocomposites. \n\nFigure 26 presents the degradation profiles obtained for the several samples studied. Most of \n\nthe obtained BC/PANi nanocomposites present three degradation peaks, except for R\u2013IS \n\nBC/PANi nanocomposite, where during the 400\u2013475 \u00baC region it presents a complex \n\ndegradation profile, as seen by its dTGA (Figure 26). This complexity, in the R\u2013IS BC/PANi \n\nnanocomposite, could indicate different degrees of polymerization of PANi probably due to \n\nthe different reaction media conditions (presence of DMAc and LiCl) during the \n\npolymerization.  \n\nFor all nanocomposites, the first weight loss under 125 \u00baC corresponds to residual \n\nwater that can be found on the samples, whereas the second weight loss, with a maximum \n\ntemperature degradation (????1) at around 250 \u00baC, corresponds to the degradation of the BC \n\nchains (26, 66). In Table 8, it is possible to observe that lower ????1 were obtained for the \n\nBC/PANi nanocomposites when compared to the unmodified BC matrixes. This \n\nobservation can be explained by the weakening of the hydrogen bonds between the cellulose \n\nchains due to the PANi introduction. This result corroborates the crystallinity indexes \n\nobtained through XRD, where it is observed a decrease on the crystallinity due to the \n\nincorporation of the conductive polymer. R\u2013IS presented the lowest degradation temperature \n\n(231.8 \u00baC) when compared with the remaining nanocomposites which is probably due to the \n\nlower crystallinity of R\u2013BC.  \n\nFor the degradation step related to BC (????1) there are no significant differences \n\nbetween D\u2013IS and D\u2013ES BC/PANi nanocomposites, whereas for FD\u2013IS and FD\u2013ES \n\nBC/PANi nanocomposites, a small difference of 26 \u00baC is observed. Also, by using different \n\nBC matrixes, no significant differences in ????1 values are obtained. In case of BC/PANi \n\nnanocomposites, the last degradation region is attributed to the PANi backbone \n\ndecomposition. This way, the TGA profile evidences the PANi incorporation into BC. \n\nFreeze dried BC/PANi nanocomposites (FD\u2013IS and FD\u2013ES) present a higher ????2 in \n\ncomparison with drained BC/PANi nanocomposites (D\u2013IS and D\u2013ES). R\u2013IS presents a \n\nsimilar ????2 as both drained BC/PANi nanocomposites. Changes in the ????2 value \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n57 \n \n\nindicate that PANi synthesized in the presence of a FD\u2013BC led into a more thermal stable \n\nconductive polymer, probably due to changes in chain orientation and/or molecular weight. \n\nConsidering the overall TGA data, it is observed that with the introduction of the \n\npolymer a less stable nanomaterial is obtained (lower onset degradation temperatures). \n\n \n\nFigure 26 \u2013 Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA and dTGA (inset)) of drained (A), freeze dried (B) and \n\nregenerated (C) BC/PANi nanocomposites.

The polymerization of aniline onto the BC matrixes was \n\nsuccessful, as seen by the SEM micrographs presented on Figure 27. On both D\u2013IS and D\u2013\n\nES BC/PANi nanocomposites it can be seen fibers with a higher width when compared to \n\nOD\u2013BC, indicating an effective coating of PANi on the BC fibers. In case of both FD\u2013\n\nBC/PANi nanocomposites, the incorporation of PANi is slightly different, where it can be \n\nobserved flakes/granules, and nearly absence of fibers at the surface. On R\u2013IS BC/PANi \n\nnanocomposite the surface became less smooth with the presence of PANi flakes on the \n\nsurface. In all nanocomposites, a more compact surface is observed which indicates that the \n\nPANi incorporation covered the pores of the BC matrixes.  \n\n The surface morphology of the BC/PANi nanocomposites was further explored \n\nthrough AFM (Figure 28). When comparing the surface roughness (Rq) values of D\u2013IS and \n\nFD\u2013IS BC/PANi nanocomposites with D\u2013ES and FD\u2013ES BC/PANi nanocomposites \n\nrespectively, there are no large differences, meaning that the polymerization process used (in \n\nsitu and ex situ polymerization) does not influence the surface roughness.  \n\nWhen using different BC matrixes, it is seen that D\u2013IS and D\u2013ES BC/PANi \n\nnanocomposites are slightly rougher when compared to FD\u2013IS and FD\u2013ES BC/PANi \n\nnanocomposites respectively. In case of R\u2013IS, it presented the greatest increase in the surface \n\nroughness in comparison to the remaining BC/PANi nanocomposites. This corroborates the \n\nSEM results where R\u2013BC shifts from a compact smooth surface into a rougher surface. \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for potential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n59 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 27 \u2013 SEM micrographs (3000x) of BC matrixes and BC/PANi nanocomposites.

The results are \n\npresented on Table 9. The polymer content, which was determined by equation 14, indicates \n\nthat the in situ polymerization positively influences the polymer content incorporated. \n\nMoreover, the electrical conductivity of both in situ nanocomposites (D\u2013IS and FD\u2013IS) is \n\n1.9\u20132.6 times higher than the nanocomposites obtained through ex situ chemical \n\npolymerization, which could indicate changes in the PANi chain orientation and/or \n\nmolecular weight. D\u2013IS BC/PANi nanocomposite presented the highest conductivity. Thus, \n\nthe underlying BC modification method should be highlighted as the most suitable for highly \n\nconductive BC/PANi nanocomposites synthesis. \n\n D\u2013IS and D\u2013ES BC/PANi nanocomposites presented lower polymer contents in \n\ncomparison to FD\u2013IS and FD\u2013ES respectively, which indicates the influence of the BC \n\nmatrix used. FD\u2013BC matrix presents a high porosity and high swelling ratio, which should \n\ncontribute to higher incorporation yields when compared to drained BC. Nevertheless, \n\nhigher conductivities were obtained for D\u2013IS and D\u2013ES BC/PANi nanocomposite in \n\ncomparison to the remaining nanocomposites (FD\u2013IS, FD\u2013ES and R\u2013IS).

Concerning the specific free energy of adsorption, the data is \n\nshown in Figure 34. Considering the high ???\n??\n\n values of PANi, its coating onto the BC fibers \n\nshould lead into stronger interactions with the polar probes. The different probes have \n\ndifferent energies of interaction since each probe interacts differently with the active sites \n\npresent at the surface. In general, to BC/PANi nanocomposites, there was an overall increase \n\nin the interactions with the polar probes, when compared to the BC matrixes, which indicates \n\nchanges in the acid\u2013base groups on the BC surface. When comparing the ???\n??\n\n values it is \n\nseen that higher values are obtained for both FD\u2013BC/PANi nanocomposites. This result \n\nagrees with the ??\n??\n\n values, where it was higher for both FD\u2013BC/PANi nanocomposites. \n\nWith the polymerization of PANi on BC, the ???\n??\n\n of ethanol increases more significantly \n\nwhen compared to tetrahydrofuran (Table 11), suggesting an increase of the basic character \n\nat the surface of BC/PANi nanocomposites, due to the amine groups in PANi. Thus, through \n\nthe evaluation of polar probes by IGC it was possible to confirm the presence of PANi in the \n\nnanocomposite surface. \n\n \n\nFigure 34 \u2013 Specific free energy of adsorption (?GSSP) of polar probes onto the BC/PANi nanocomposites at 25 \n\n\u00baC BC \u2013 oven dried BC; FD\u2013BC \u2013 freeze dried BC; R\u2013BC \u2013 regenerated BC; PANi \u2013 polyaniline; D\u2013IS \u2013 drained \n\nBC/PANi in situ nanocomposite; FD\u2013IS \u2013  freeze dried BC/PANi in situ nanocomposite; R\u2013IS \u2013 regenerated \n\nBC/PANi nanocomposite; D\u2013ES \u2013 drained BC/PANi ex situ nanocomposite; FD\u2013ES \u2013  freeze dried BC/PANi \n\nex situ nanocomposite. \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n70 \n \n\n \n\nThe Kb/Ka ratio of the BC matrixes shows an acidic character (0.57 to 0.75) due to \n\nthe hydroxyl groups at the surface. For PANi powder a basic character is observed (Table \n\n11), which results from the presence of amine groups throughout the polymer chains. With \n\nthe introduction of PANi in the BC matrixes, the BC acidic behaviour is shifted into a basic \n\nbehaviour (Kb/Ka ranging from 1.88 to 3.77), corroborating the fact that the polymer can be \n\nfound at the surface. Also, the percentage of N and O, presented in Table 7, gives an \n\nindication of the relative basicity of the BC/PANi nanocomposites. The percentage of N is \n\nassociated with the amine groups of PANi whereas the percentage of O is associated to the \n\nhydroxyl and ether groups of cellulose. When compared to the Kb/Ka values (Table 11), it is \n\nseen that the presence of N and lower O values is associated with higher Kb/Ka values. \n\n The Kb/Ka values are too dispersed which means that there is no correlation with the \n\npolymerization method nor the BC matrix employed with the acid\u2013base surface properties. \n\n \n\n3.2.5.3 \u2013 Surface nanomorphology  \n\n \n\nIGC was also employed to evaluate the surface nanomorphology and the influence of \n\nthe BC matrix and polymerization method used in the BC/PANi nanocomposite synthesis. \n\nWith the incorporation of PANi, the BC SBET is drastically reduced (64\u201385%). This decrease \n\nis probably due that during chemical polymerization, PANi incorporates on the fibers (higher \n\nwidths) and pores are obstructed, which not only decrease the area available for probes to \n\naccess (thus decreasing the SBET) but also makes harder for probes to cross the sample (lower \n\nDp, (Table 12)). Through SEM it is observed that the surface becomes more compact (Figure \n\n27), corroborating the IGC results. This way, through SBET and Dp analysis from IGC it is \n\npossible to obtain information regarding the pore availability. \n\n The SBET have no direct correlation with the polymerization method nor with BC \n\nmatrix used for the synthesis of BC/PANi nanocomposites. On the other hand, the Dp values \n\nof D\u2013IS and FD\u2013IS BC/PANi nanocomposites are higher than the values obtained in D\u2013ES \n\nand FD\u2013ES BC/PANi nanocomposites, respectively. Thus, IGC evidences that the diffusion \n\nof the probes is influenced by the polymerization method applied, which indicates differences \n\non the structure of the different nanocomposites.

Through \n\nTukey\u2019s post hoc analysis, the data obtained by 2,2,4\u2013trimethylpentane fall into three groups: \n\nex situ composites, in situ composites and R\u2013IS BC/PANi nanocomposite. This indicates that \n\nthis probe did not detect changes in the pore availability using different BC matrixes but it \n\nwas influenced by the polymerization method used. For 2,5\u2013dimethylhexane the results are \n\ndispersed which means that this probe did not evidenced differences in the pore availability \n\nof the nanocomposites by employing different polymerization methods or different BC \n\nmatrixes. When comparing to the BC matrixes, the morphology index obtained by \n\ncyclooctane shows that the pore availability decreases in the nanocomposites since it shifts \n\nfrom an adsorption (BC matrixes) to a steric hindrance (BC/PANi nanocomposites) \n\nbehaviour. This observation agrees with the SBET and Dp results (Table 12), since blocking the \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n72 \n \n\nBC pores results in a more compact surface, leading into lower SBET values. The cyclooctane \n\nmorphology indexes obtained for D\u2013IS and FD\u2013IS BC/PANi nanocomposites are slightly \n\nhigher than the ones obtained in D\u2013ES and FD\u2013ES BC/PANi nanocomposites. Also, in situ \n\nnanocomposites (D\u2013IS and FD\u2013IS) present higher morphology indexes in comparison to ex \n\nsitu nanocomposites (D\u2013ES and FD\u2013ES). Thus, cyclooctane evidenced differences in the \n\nsurface availability using different polymerization methods and BC matrixes. \n\n Through AFM it was observed that the BC/PANi nanocomposites are rougher than \n\nthe BC matrixes (Figure 28), which explains the steric hindrance observed for cyclooctane. \n\nR\u2013IS BC/PANi nanocomposite depicted the highest surface roughness of all \n\nnanocomposites which interestingly presented an adsorption behaviour for cyclooctane \n\n(morphology index >1). This indicates that the surface topography of the sample contributed \n\nto the adsorption of the probe, as also seen through SBET measurement.   \n\n Thus, through IGC it was possible to observe an increase of the steric hindrance \n\nthrough the morphology index of cyclooctane, which is correlated with the incorporation of \n\nPANi on the surface. Moreover, this result corroborates the Rq values obtained through \n\nAFM, where a rougher surface is obtained. R\u2013IS was the only nanocomposite who presented \n\nan adsorption phenomenon for cyclooctane which could mean that the surface topography \n\nwas favourable for the adsorption of the probe. It was also evidenced differences in the surface \n\nmorphology through the use of different polymerization methods (in situ and ex situ \n\npolymerization) as also through the use of different BC matrixes. \n\n  \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n73 \n \n\n3.3 \u2013 Application of BC/PANi nanocomposites for potential drug \n\ndelivery system \n\n \n\nThe development of novel electrical responsive membranes for drug delivery are of \n\ngreat interest, which could offer promising new treatments, as a transdermal patch, for \n\nchronic diseases that require daily injections of daily dosages of medication. The synthesis of \n\nBC/PANi nanocomposites offers a simple pathway to obtain an electro-responsive \n\nnanocomposite. This chapter aims to study which of the BC modifications previously made \n\nare the most suited for an efficient drug delivery system through electrical stimulus.  \n\nDue to the unique properties of PANi, for an effective drug delivery system, only \n\ncharged and small drugs should be used (141). Sulfacetamide was chosen for this study, due \n\nto its antibacterial properties and negative charge. This compound acts as a competitor with \n\np\u2013aminobenzoic acid, which is an essential component of the bacterial growth (142). It is \n\ncommonly used topically, against acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis (142).  \n\n \n\n3.3.1 \u2013 Work of adhesion and drug loading \n\n \n\nThe interaction of the drug with the BC matrixes and BC/PANi nanocomposites was \n\nstudied through both Wadh and Wcoh determined by IGC. The Wadh corresponds to the \n\ninteractions between the drug and the membranes while the Wcoh corresponds to the \n\ninteractions established inside of the membrane. A higher Wadh/Wcoh ratio indicates a higher \n\ninteraction of the drug with the membrane. Moreover, the interfacial interactions were \n\ncompared to the amount of drug absorbed (Table 13). In case of the BC matrixes, the ratio \n\npresented is close to 1 which indicates good dispersibility of sodium sulfacetamide in BC. For \n\nthe BC/PANi nanocomposites, both Wadh and Wcoh increased, more significantly in the last. \n\nThis way the resulting ratio decreases, which indicates that the interactions between \n\npolyaniline chains found in the surface are stronger than the interactions between the \n\nnanocomposite surface and the drug. Based on this result it is estimated a lower dispersibility \n\nof the drug in the nanocomposite when they are compared to the BC matrixes.

This way, it is possible to conclude that \n\nthe drug loading capacity of the nanocomposites is affected by the BC matrix employed for \n\nthe synthesis of BC/PANi nanocomposites. Moreover, with the incorporation of PANi it \n\nwas observed that the pores were obstructed and as such it is expected a lower ability to \n\nabsorb the drug.  \n\n \n\n3.3.2 \u2013 Antimicrobial activity \n \n\nThe growth dynamic of E. coli was evaluated by measuring the optical density at 600 \n\nnm over time, in both unmodified and drug loaded membranes (Figure 35).

Taking in \n\nconsideration the time needed to observe an inhibition onto E. coli growth, the membranes \n\npresent a slow diffusion of the drug onto the media. In the remaining drug loaded samples \n\nthere was no inhibition in the bacterial growth which suggests that the following hypothesis \n\nmight have occurred: (i) the drug loaded in the membranes was not released (ii) the lethal \n\ndose of the drug is higher than the one loaded and fully released by the membranes and/or \n\n(iii) the drug was partially released in amounts lower than the lethal dose.  \n\n \n\nFigure 36 \u2013 Cells number of E. coli after 24 h of contact time with the membranes under analysis. \n\n \n\n Drug loaded drained in situ BC/PANi (D\u2013IS (D)) was the only nanocomposite that \n\npresented an inhibitory effect on E. coli.

Control \u2013 \n\nE.coli grown without the presence of membrane; D\u2013IS (D) \u2013 drug loaded drained BC/PANi in situ \n\nnanocomposite; Shock D\u2013IS (D) - drug loaded drained BC/PANi in situ nanocomposite submitted to electrical \n\nstimulus. \n\n \n\n The drug loaded nanocomposite without electrical stimulus (D\u2013IS (D)) presented a \n\nlower growth inhibition on E. coli (13%) when compared to the drug loaded nanocomposite \n\nsubmitted to electrical stimulus (shock D\u2013IS (D), 20%).  Slight differences between the two \n\nmembranes start at 4 hours after exposure, being accentuated over time. This preliminary test \n\nshows promising results regarding the use of drug loaded BC/PANi nanocomposites for drug \n\nrelease applications. Nevertheless, the current experiment was not optimized, needing further \n\ntests. Some parameters that should be taken into consideration during the optimization are \n\nthe drug incorporation efficiency (using different drug concentration solutions) and the \n\nvoltage applied onto the membrane. The current test was an indirect method to observe the \n\nrelease of the drug. Thus, a more suitable method for the direct quantification of the drug \n\nreleased should be considered, such as the determination through UV-Vis. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n79 \n \n\nChapter IV \u2013 Conclusion \n\n \n\n The current work aims to determine the most suitable method for BC/PANi synthesis \n\nfor drug delivery applications through electrical stimulus. The present research shows that \n\nthe BC/PANi nanocomposites were successfully synthesized using different BC matrixes \n\n(drained, freeze dried and regenerated), as well as through different polymerization methods \n\n(in situ and ex situ). The electrical conductivities obtained varied between 1.48x10-3 to 1.39x10-\n\n1 S/cm, which fall within the range of semiconductive materials. \n\n The BC/PANi nanocomposites were submitted through a series of analysis to \n\nevaluate the influence of the different BC modification methods in the physico-chemical \n\nproperties of the resulting material. FTIR\u2013ATR and EDX evidenced a successful coating of \n\nPANI on BC fibers, being visible through SEM. The thermal stability of the different \n\nnanocomposites decreased in comparison to the original BC matrix, which could be \n\ncorrelated to the loss of the crystallinity content of BC during the modification. In this regard, \n\nthe crystallinity of the freeze dried BC/PANi nanocomposites were less affected than the \n\ndrained BC/PANi nanocomposites.  \n\n Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) has proven to be a valuable technique in the \n\nevaluation of the changes occurred with PANi incorporation into BC. It is observed a \n\nsignificant increase in the surface energy of the nanocomposites, as well as a shift from an \n\nacidic surface (BC matrixes) to a basic surface (BC/PANi nanocomposites). Moreover, \n\nchanges in the BC structure due to the different modification methods was observed, where \n\nthe different BC/PANi nanocomposites presented a more compact (lower SBET and lower Dp) \n\nand rougher surface. Thus, the current work evidence the influence of the different BC \n\ntreatments in the properties of the resulting nanocomposite. \n\n Through the antimicrobial activity tests, drug loaded drained BC/PANi in situ \n\nnanocomposite was the only BC modification that successfully presented an inhibitory \n\ngrowth on E. coli (up to 13%) without electrical stimulus. With the electrical stimulus, the \n\ninhibitory growth was further increased (up to 20%). Further investigation needs to be done, \n\nnamely in the optimization of the drug loading efficiency, as well as the employment of \n\ndifferent voltages. Also, the drug release kinetics should be studied, with the aim to \n\nunderstand the dynamic process of drug release. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nAlternative synthesis methods of electrically conductive bacterial cellulose-polyaniline composites for \n\npotential drug delivery application \n\n \n\n81 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n1.
