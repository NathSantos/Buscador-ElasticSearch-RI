Um problema recorrente \u00e9 \n\ncausado pelo fen\u00f4meno conhecido como APB (Annular Pressure \nBuilup), consequ\u00eancia do processo de aquecimento do po\u00e7o durante a \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de hidrocarbonetos oriundos do reservat\u00f3rio. Este \n\naquecimento afeta o espa\u00e7o anular do po\u00e7o, que se encontra \n\ncompletamente selado e preenchido com fluido de perfura\u00e7\u00e3o, que sofre \n\nexpans\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica. A expans\u00e3o do fluido aumenta a press\u00e3o anular para \n\nn\u00edveis que podem ultrapassar a resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica dos elementos \n\ntubulares que comp\u00f5em o po\u00e7o, levando \u00e0 perda de sua integridade. A \n\nfim de evitar o colapso do tubo, v\u00e1rias estrat\u00e9gias s\u00e3o utilizadas para \n\nmitigar o APB, tal como o Vacuum Insulated Tubing (VIT). A t\u00e9cnica \n\nconsiste na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de dois tubos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o conc\u00eantricos que s\u00e3o \n\nsoldados nas suas extremidades, formando um espa\u00e7o anular, que ent\u00e3o \n\n\u00e9 evacuado, reduzindo a transfer\u00eancia de calor radial. No entanto, uma \n\nvez que a conex\u00e3o entre cada dois tubos n\u00e3o \u00e9 termicamente isolada, a \n\ntransfer\u00eancia de calor pode ser significativa nesta regi\u00e3o. O presente \n\ntrabalho prop\u00f5e um estudo te\u00f3rico da transfer\u00eancia de calor no sistema \n\nVIT. Primeiramente, o problema t\u00e9rmico foi modelado e simulado com \n\no aux\u00edlio de um software comercial utilizando o m\u00e9todo dos volumes \n\nfinitos (MVF). Foi proposto um modelo em regime permanente baseado \n\nem circuito t\u00e9rmico equivalente bidimensional (modelo nodal). Um \n\nrefino do modelo nodal foi efetuado para que apresentasse resultados \n\nsimilares aos encontrados utilizando o MVF, sendo uma alternativa f\u00e1cil \n\npara incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o em um simulador multif\u00edsico de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de petr\u00f3leo \n\nem po\u00e7os. Desta forma, o modelo t\u00e9rmico nodal do VIT foi acoplado a \n\num simulador de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de po\u00e7os (hidrodin\u00e2mico-t\u00e9rmico-estrutural) \n\ngerando resultados mais realistas do que os atualmente empregados na \n\nind\u00fastria de petr\u00f3leo. Estes resultados foram validados com dados de \n\ncampo para dois po\u00e7os de petr\u00f3leo e contra resultados oriundos de um \n\nsoftware comercial extensivamente utilizado por engenheiros de \n\npetr\u00f3leo em projeto de po\u00e7os.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: VIT, APB, Po\u00e7o, Petr\u00f3leo, An\u00e1lise nodal, Simula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nnum\u00e9rica. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nAnnular Pressure Buildup (APB) is a recurring problem that affects high \n\npressure and high temperature wells during oil exploration and \n\nproduction in deepwater scenarios. Wellbore heating is caused by the \n\nupward flow of heated hydrocarbons towards the wellhead. The \n\ntemperature rise affects the annular space of the borehole, which is often \n\nsealed and completely filled with drilling fluid, causing its expansion. \n\nThe expansion of the fluid increases the annulus pressure to levels that \n\ncan surpass the structural limits of the materials, posing a risk to the \n\nwellbore integrity. In order to avoid the collapse of the tube, several \n\nstrategies are commonly used to mitigate APB, such as the use of \n\nVacuum Insulated Tubing (VIT). This technique consists of using two \n\nconcentric metallic tubes that are welded at their extremities, forming an \n\nannular space that is subsequently evacuated to minimize radial heat \n\ntransfer. However, since the connection between each pair of tubes is \n\nnot insulated, heat transfer can be significant in VIT junction region. \n\nThis work proposes a theoretical analysis of the heat transfer in wells \n\nassisted by VIT systems. Firstly, the thermal problem was modeled and \n\nsimulated using the finite volume method (FVM) with a commercial \n\nsoftware package. A steady-state equivalent thermal network (ETN) \n\nmodel was developed and its mesh refinement was adjusted such that it \n\nprovides results similar to those obtained with the FVM, but with a \n\nmuch lower computational cost. The VIT ETN model was then coupled \n\nto a multiphysics wellbore simulator (hydrodynamic-thermal-structural), \n\nproducing potentially more realistic results for the oil industry. Such \n\nresults have been compared and validated with field data from two \n\nactual petroleum wells and against data from a commercial software \n\npackage extensively used by the major oil companies in wellbore \n\ndesign. \n\n \n\nKeywords: APB, VIT, Wellbore, Petroleum, Nodal analysis, Numerical \n\nsimulation.  \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\nFIGURE 1.1 \u2013 SUBSEA VERTICAL WELL PRODUCTION SCHEME. ................................... 34 \nFIGURE 1.2 \u2013 0.4064 M (16 IN) OUTER DIAMETER CASING COLLAPSED DURING HOT FLUID \n\nCIRCULATION DUE TO APB (PATTILLO ET AL., 2006). .................................... 35 \nFIGURE 1.3 \u2013 TYPICAL CASING DESIGN OF A SUBSEA WELL (YIN ET AL., 2014). ............ 36 \nFIGURE 2.1 \u2013 COMPARISON OF MEASURED AND PREDICTED BOTTOMHOLE PRESSURE \n\n(BELLARBY, 2009 ADAPTED FROM PUCKNELL ET AL., 1993). ...................... 42 \nFIGURE 2.2 \u2013 DIFFERENT FLOW REGIMES IN VERTICAL PIPE (COLLIER AND THOME, \n\n1994). ................................................................................................... 44 \nFIGURE 2.3 \u2013 WELLBORE ARCHITECTURE AS A THERMAL RESISTANCE NETWORK \n\n(SHOUSHTARI ET AL., 2012 AFTER INCROPERA ET AL., 2007). ................... 47 \nFIGURE 2.4 \u2013 COMPARISON BETWEEN ANNULUS GAP APPROACHES FOR PREDICTING \n\nCONVECTION HEAT TRANSFER (XIONG ET AL., 2015). ...................................... 53 \nFIGURE 2.5 \u2013 WELLBORE ARRANGEMENTS: (A) CEMENTED INTERVAL, (B) \n\nCEMENT/FORMATION INTERFACE (MODIFIED FROM HALAL AND MITCHELL, 1994).\n ............................................................................................................. 55 \n\nFIGURE 2.6 \u2013 DETERMINING FACTORS OF THE APB (BELLARBY, 2009). .................. 58 \nFIGURE 2.7 \u2013 SCHEMATIC FIGURES OF A SUBSEA (A) AND A SURFACE (B) WELLHEAD \n\nSYSTEM (SULTAN ET AL., 2008). ...........................................................64\nFIGURE 2.8 \u2013 VIT CONNECTION DETAILS. .............................................................. 64 \nFIGURE 2.9 \u2013 VIT CONFIGURATIONS (BELLARBY, 2009). ...................................... 66 \nFIGURE 2.10 \u2013 HEAT FLUXES (ARROWS) IN THE VIT BODY AND CONNECTION SECTIONS \n\n(MODIFIED FROM AZZOLA ET AL., 2004). ...................................................... 68 \nFIGURE 2.11 \u2013 RADIAL HEAT FLUX AND VIT OUTER SURFACE TEMPERATURE UNDER \n\nFORCED CONVECTION (PATTILLO ET AL., 2003). ............................................. 69 \nFIGURE 2.12 \u2013 FINITE DIFFERENCE CODE DISCRETIZATION SCHEME (AZZOLA ET AL., \n\n2004). ................................................................................................... 71 \nFIGURE 2.13 \u2013 A BASIC VIT CONFIGURATION WITH THE THREAD ON THE OUTER TUBE \n\n(NOWINKA ET AL., 2005). ...................................................................... 73 \nFIGURE 2.14 \u2013 EFFECT OF THE VIT ON THE PRODUCTION THERMAL PROFILE OF AN ARCTIC \n\nDEVIATED WELL (SINGH ET AL., 2005). ....................................................... 75 \nFIGURE 2.15 \u2013 WELLBORE SCHEMATIC ASSUMING 1,100 M OF VIT JUST BELOW THE \n\nWELLHEAD (FERREIRA ET AL., 2012). ........................................................ 76 \nFIGURE 2.16 \u2013 APB AS A FUNCTION OF PRODUCTION TIME (FERREIRA ET AL., 2012). 76 \nFIGURE 2.17 \u2013 EFFECT OF THE ANNULUS CONVECTION APPROACH ON THE PRODUCTION \n\nANNULUS TEMPERATURE PROFILE IN A WELLBORE WITH VIT (KANG ET AL., 2015). 78 \nFIGURE 3.1 \u2013 VIT GEOMETRY (API CONNECTION THREAD).

As a result, well integrity \n\nhas become one of the most critical aspects during well construction and \n\noperation.  \n\nSome of the offshore oil reserves recently discovered in Brazil lie \n\nin reservoirs located at long depths, far away from the coast. For \n\nexample, the pre-salt area in the Santos basin is characterized by water \n\ncolumns up to 2,300 m deep and target depths greater than 5,000 m, \n\nwith salt layers reaching thicknesses of 2,500 m. The large light-oil \n\nreservoirs (28 to 32 degrees API) in the pre-salt region have typical \n\npressures of 60 MPa and temperatures up to 390 K.  \n\nAlong with the growth of petroleum exploration and production \n\nin harsh environmental conditions, numerous technical challenges have \n\nemerged, such as well construction in harsh conditions (ultra-deep \n\nwater, thick salt layers, high hardness reservoir rocks, high pressure \n\nwells), complex flow assurance strategies (hydrate and wax formation \n\ninhibition, scale mitigation) and the choice of suitable enhanced oil \n\nrecovery methods. \n\nGiven the large costs involved in deep water operations, the \n\nproduced hydrocarbons are expected to be transported from the well to \n\nthe often remote processing facilities with the least amount of energy \n\n(flow and thermal) losses. From the reservoir rock to the surface \n\nfacilities, three different stages of hydrocarbon flow can be identified \n\n(considering a subsea vertical well): \n\n? Radial liquid or gas-liquid flow through the permeable reservoir \nrock to the wellbore; \n\n? Vertical gas-liquid flow through a circular pipe from the bottom \nhole to the wellhead; \n\n? Horizontal flow followed an inclined pipe flow through the \nflowline from the wellhead to the SPU (Stationary Production \n\nUnit).  \n\nIn each of those stages, the flow behaves differently and the \n\ncorresponding pressure loss and temperature distributions are governed \n\nby different sets of variables. In this work, only the wellbore flow stage \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nwill be considered, since it is responsible for the major portion of the \n\npressure loss. Figure 1.1 illustrates the production scheme of a subsea \n\nvertical well and the path followed by the produced fluid from the \n\nreservoir to the production facilities (yellow arrows).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Subsea vertical well production scheme. \n\n \n\nSimilar to the fluid flow, a heat transfer analysis and its impact on \n\nthe wellbore structure is of major importance in well design. Thermal \n\nphenomena play an important role in several aspects of deep water oil \n\nproduction, such as tubing and casing stress analysis, material selection \n\n(metals and elastomers) and tubing well performance and sizing \n\n(BELLARBY, 2009). \n\nFurthermore, knowledge of the wellhead temperature during well \n\nproduction is an important issue, since directly affects the flow line \n\nsizing and primary oil processing operations on the SPU. Knowing the \n\ntemperature gradient along the well depth is essential in well design and \n\nconstruction, since the fluids and equipment used in drilling and \n\ncompletion are selected based on the local pressure and temperature \n\nconditions. Therefore, controlling thermal events and their consequences \nhas been a concern for oil companies since the early days of deep water \n\nproduction in the 1960s (EZELL et al., 2010).  \nOther reasons for controlling the temperature of a wellbore during \n\noil and gas production can be outlined as follows: \n\n? Prevention or reduction of wax deposition in the tubing; \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n \n\n \n\n? Tubing scale mitigation; \n\n? Prevention of hydrate blockage; \n\n? Reducing thermal loads on the surrounding casing; \n\n? Maintaining low-viscosity fluid flow; \n\n? Reduction in annular pressure buildup. \nGenerally speaking, all of the above issues require reducing the \n\noutward heat transfer from the well. In particular, reducing wellbore \n\nheating during hydrocarbon production is crucial to the safety of the \n\nproduction process. For instance, two main problems can be highlighted \n\nregarding the well integrity: (i) the casing collapse and (ii) the casing \n\nconnection compression failure. The first is caused by the APB \n\n(Annulus Pressure  Buildup), which occurs when the hydrocarbon flow \n\nheats up the entire region close to the production string, forcing the \n\nexpansion of the surrounding fluids and, consequently, the \n\npressurization of the well annuli. The increase in pressure may exceed \n\nthe mechanical strength of the casings, causing them to collapse, as \n\nshown in Figure 1.2. The second problem arises due to casing dilation. \n\nCasing strings are set at the wellhead on the high-pressure housing \n\nthrough the casing hanger, and fixed to the rock formation by the \n\ncement. Thermally induced dilation causes the casing string to be \n\ncompressed to a point at which the casing connection resistance is \n\nsurpassed. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 0.4064 m (16 in) outer diameter casing collapsed during hot fluid \n\ncirculation due to APB (PATTILLO et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nThe thermal/mechanical response of the well to the upward flow \n\nof hydrocarbons is related to its inner structure as well as to the \n\nsurrounding formation. For instance, cementing operations are \n\nmandatory in all drilling activities as they assure the hydraulic insulation \n\nbetween permeable layers of the formation besides keeping the casing \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nfixed to the borehole walls. The well cementing process is made \n\ngradually following the drilling of each phase, which is defined by a \n\nlength that depends on the rock formation pressures. As the wellbore is \n\ndrilled, its diameter decreases and a new casing needs to be set and \n\ncemented. In the first couple of phases, the entire annular space between \n\nthe borehole walls and the casing is completely filled by cement up to \n\nthe wellhead. In the following phases, the cement slurry usually does not \n\nfill the well up to the wellhead. In turn, the region above the top of \n\ncement (TOC) is completed with the drilling fluid used to drill that \n\nphase of the well. Figure 1.3 illustrates a typical casing design of a \n\nsubsea well with three annuli (A, B and C) filled by different fluids. In \n\nthis text, the symbol A always denotes the innermost annulus, followed \n\nby the symbols B, C and so on, as the radial distance increases. \n \n\n \nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Typical casing design of a subsea well (YIN et al., 2014). \n\n \n\nTherefore, depending on the location of the TOC in the annular \n\nspace (i.e., above or below the casing shoe), the drilling fluid can be \n\nconfined or not. Generally, the pressure increase is limited by the \n\nformation fracture resistance (FERREIRA et al., 2012). At this \n\ncondition, when the annulus pressure reaches the so-called formation \n\n\n\n 37 \n\n \n\n \n\nleak-off pressure, an amount of fluid proportional to the volume increase \n\ndue to the annulus expansion flows into the formation until the annulus \n\nand the formation pressures become equal. However, if the TOC is \n\nplaced above the casing shoe, the annulus is not in contact with the \n\n\u201csafety valve\u201d provided by nature (MOE and ERPELDING, 2000). As a \n\nresult, the annular pressure cannot be relieved, which increases the stress \n\nin the tubulars, leading eventually to a well failure (HASAN et al., \n\n2009). \n\nDespite the efforts made in the last two decades, the discovery of \n\nnew production scenarios and the development of new technologies \n\ncreated a need for identifying and predicting the key variables that \n\ncontrol the annular pressure buildup (APB). Consequently, this work \n\nintends to model, predict and propose strategies to mitigate this \n\nphenomenon in deep water wells. To this end, a fully-coupled \n\nmultiphysics model has been proposed to account for all main \n\nhydrodynamic, thermal and mechanical aspects encountered in real \n\nwells. Furthermore, in order to reduce the heat transfer to the formation, \n\nthe use of VIT (Vacuum Insulated Tubing) joints is considered in detail. \n\nHence, the major contribution of this thesis is the development of a VIT \n\nthermal model that, when incorporated into a wellbore simulator, can \n\nprovide an accurate evaluation of its APB mitigation potential. In the \n\nfollowing section, the motivation and the goals of the thesis are \n\npresented. \n \n\n1.2 Motivation \n\nAPB has been a concern in the petroleum industry since the \n\n1990s due to a failure in a Marlin field well in the Gulf of Mexico \n\n(AZZOLA et al., 2004, GOSCH et al., 2004, ELLIS et al., 2004). Since \n\nthen, an increasingly important issue in deep water exploitation has been \n\nthe evaluation of appraisal wells as possible production wellbores. The \n\nreason is that it is difficult to justify economically the abandonment of a \n\nwellbore that has cost tens of millions of dollars to drill, a typical figure \n\nfor the Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster. On the other hand, the potential \n\nconsequences of a well failure during its production cannot be \n\nneglected. Central to this evaluation is the consideration of well integrity \n\nissues associated with APB.  \n\nTherefore, the use of insulated tubes to thermally assist critical \n\nwells is a more attractive alternative than the undesirable restriction of \n\nthe production stream, which directly limits profit.  In fact, the frequent \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nneed for thermal insulation systems in oil wells in the appraisal and \n\ndevelopment phases of the Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster alone serves as \n\nmotivation for the present study. \n\nWhile there are few relevant publications concerning insulation \n\nmaterials applied to wellbores, most of them are related to testing and \n\napplication of thermal insulation materials in flowlines, manifolds, \n\nChristmas trees and risers. The main concerns are associated to the \n\ncooling effect due to the cold seawater (HUDSON et al., 2000; \nRUSCHAU et al., 2010; GREALISH and RODDY, 2002) and, in many \n\ncases, there are no restriction on insulation thickness to reach a suitable \n\nperformance (WATKINS, 2000; MELVE, 2001; MCKECHNIE, 2002; \n\nGOU et al., 2004).   \n\nHowever, during well construction and production operations, \n\nseveral heat exchange phenomena occur between the rock formation, the \n\nwellbore fluids (produced fluid, drilling fluid and completion fluid), the \n\ndrilling and tubing string components, the casings and the cement. \n\nTemperature and pressure prediction in each section has an important \n\nrole in the planning of critical operations. The rate of heat transfer from \n\nthe wellbore is affected by many parameters, such as the formation type \n\nand fluid properties, well geometry, operation time, flow rates and water \n\ndepth.  \n\nNumerical simulation allows an accurate prediction of these \n\nphenomena, enabling a safer and more efficient planning of some well \n\noperations. Most simulators are based on the finite difference and finite \n\nvolume methods to solve the governing equations for the thermal-\n\nhydraulic behavior of the multiphase system. However, there are \n\nspecific points to be improved in the available well numerical \n\nsimulators, such as the coupling with the reservoir and the insertion of \n\nmultiple thermal insulation sections in the production string, which \n\ndirectly affects the radial heat transfer from the wellbore and the APB. \n\nTherefore, the development of detailed multiphysics models \n\ncapable of accurately predicting the hydrodynamic, thermal and \n\nmechanical behavior of oil wells, as well as their behavior while assisted \n\nby thermal insulation systems (e.g., VIT) will certainly contribute to \n\nmore efficient wellbore design strategies in the Pre-salt Cluster. \n\nImportant to realize that uncertainties about formation properties \n\nand even related to wellbore sensors data employed as input parameters \n\nmay lead to incorrect predictions obtained from wellbore simulators. \n\nAlso, it is worth mentioning the importance to comprehensively handle \n\nall the multiphysics aspects taking place in the wellbore for all time \n\nscales experienced by the well during production. \n\n\n\n 39 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3 Objectives \n\nThe overall objective of the thesis is to carry out a comprehensive \n\nanalysis of the multiphase flow and heat transfer in wellbores along with \n\nits mechanical behavior, including a detailed evaluation of thermally \n\ninsulated tubing sections in the production string. The appropriate \n\nprediction of the temperature field in the wellbore deserves somewhat \n\nattention, since the mechanical responses and, consequently, the APB \n\nquantification are directly affected by the local heat transfer calculation. \n\nThus, the specific goals of the present work are: \n\n? To develop a heat transfer model based on the analogy between \nthermal and electrical circuits, aiming to quantify the thermal \n\ndesign parameters of the VIT unit (overall heat transfer \n\ncoefficient and effective thermal conductivity). Because of its \n\ntwo-dimensional form, this approach is able to capture \n\nimportant aspects of the heat transfer in the junction region at a \n\nreduced computational cost and can, therefore, be easily \n\nintegrated in wellbore heat transfer simulators. A validation of \n\nthe equivalent thermal network (ETN) model is carried out \n\nusing a commercial software package to solve the combined \n\nheat transfer (conduction-radiation) equations in differential \n\nform via the Finite Volume Method; \n\n? To incorporate the two-dimensional VIT thermal model in an \nin-house multiphysics (hydrodynamic, thermal, structural) \n\nwellbore (MW) model (Hafemann, 2015) and evaluate multiple \n\nscenarios involving different operating conditions and \n\nparameters of the VIT. The results of this analysis are expected \n\nto provide insight into VIT applications to mitigate APB and its \n\neffects on the wellbore mechanical integrity. \n\n? To validate the full model (ETN + MW models) using field data \nand commercial software results. For the latter, the commercial \n\npackage Wellcat\u2122, offered by Halliburton/Landmark and \n\nextensively employed by petroleum engineers during well \n\ndesign phase to predict the wellbore thermal-hydraulic and \n\nmechanical behaviors, has been used. \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n1.4 Document outline \n\nThis document is composed of five chapters. Chapter 2 consists \n\nof a literature review, in which numerical models of multiphase flow \n\nand heat transfer in wellbores are presented highlighting the \n\nquantification of the APB. Moreover, experimental works and heat \n\ntransfer models relating to the VIT performance and field application are \n\nalso described. In the end of this section the main insights about the \n\nliterature review is briefly described and the contributions of this thesis \n\nto cover the gaps found in the literature are highlighted. Chapter 3 \n\ndescribes a theoretically based methodology developed to assess the \n\nthermal performance of VIT systems through a parametric evaluation of \n\ntheir thermal properties and geometrical parameters. Two independent \n\nformulations were tested, namely a 3-D numerical differential model (3-\n\nD FVM) and a 2-D nodal approach (2-D equivalent thermal network \u2013 \n\nETN model). The similarities and differences of each model are \n\nexplored through a fundamental analysis of the VIT performance. Then, \n\nthe methodology to incorporate the 2-D ETN model into a wellbore \n\nsimulator is described. Chapter 4 refers to the results reached in this \n\nthesis emphasizing the importance of incorporation the VIT thermal \n\napproach into the wellbore simulator. In addition, two case studies using \n\nactual wells are suggested to predict the thermal-structural behavior of \n\nwellbores as well as to validate the coupled model. Chapter 5 presents \n\nthe conclusions and recommendations for future works. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nIn this chapter, a review of the existing numerical and analytical \n\nmultiphase flow and heat transfer models applied to wellbores are \n\npresented, while highlighting their assumptions and limitations, and \n\ntheir use on the quantification of APB. The review is extended by \n\npresenting experimentally based studies related to the VIT\u2019s \n\nperformance and field application.  \n\n \n\n2.1 Wellbore multiphysics phenomena  \n\nThe calculation of production parameters influenced by fluid \n\nflow and heat transfer in wellbores is unquestionably challenging. For \n\ninstance, rigorous prediction of a multiphase multicomponent flow \n\nsystem in wellbores is complex phenomenon, since it is related to the \n\nphase change of mixtures pressure, temperature and liquid holdup.  \n\nDespite the technical difficulties, modeling of multiphase flow and heat \n\ntransfer during oil and gas production to predict the pressure and \n\ntemperature profiles in the tubing string and in well annuli is a core skill \n\nfor any oil company. It is fundamental to predict flow rates, select the \n\ncorrect size of tubulars and equipment, and consider the occurrence of \n\ncorrosion and erosion rates and many other tasks. Therefore, the \n\ncomplex nature of these multiphysics phenomena have boosted a series \n\nof studies, which will be reviewed in the following sections. \n\n \n\n2.1.1 Multiphase flow models in wellbores \n\nMultiphase flow in wellbores takes place in several activities \n\nduring well construction and production/injection phases. Even though \n\nseveral works deal with thermal fluid flow in wellbores, there are some \n\nchallenges involved in the modeling of multiphase flows to simulate \n\npetroleum production in different types of wells (tubing diameter, well \n\ntrajectory), operational conditions (pressure, temperature), and \n\nhydrocarbon composition. However, given the wide range of different \n\nflowing systems and regimes, a multitude of multiphase flow models, \n\nmost of which numerically-based, were developed by the literature \n\naiming to precisely mimic the complex phenomenological nature \n\nexisting in wellbores worldwide. Due to the complex nature of the \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\npetroleum production process and the high number of variables involved \n\nin estimating pressure and temperature profiles, many approaches have \n\nbeen used to solve the fluid flow in oil wells. Earlier approaches were \n\nbased on empirical or semi empirical methods and were not able to \n\ncapture the entire physics of the multiphase flow. Additionally, these \n\nmethods may not be suitable for predicting pressure and liquid holdup \n\ntransients. More recently, however, there has been a shift towards a \n\nmore fundamental modeling of flow in wells, using the so-called \n\nmechanistic approach (CANDIA and CRUZ, 2004). This approach is \n\nbased on the solution of local averaged conservation equations for the \n\nvariables of interest (pressure, temperature, velocity, and liquid holdup) \n\n(CANDIA and CRUZ, 2004), and can be extended to more general \n\nproblems, such as three-dimensional and transient flows. \n\nPucknell et al. (1993) published a survey focusing on models \nused to predict the wellhead pressure in 212 oil wells. Figure 2.1 shows \n\nthe error associated with some multiphase flow models, which are \n\nwidely accepted in the oil industry, in relation to field data. According to \n\nFigure 2.1, the average error was relatively low, between 7.6 and 14%, \n\nand all models reported show consistency. \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Comparison of measured and predicted bottomhole pressure \n\n(BELLARBY, 2009 adapted from PUCKNELL et al., 1993). \n\n \n\nOne of the major difficulties in dealing with multiphase flows is \n\nthat mass, momentum, and energy transfer rates and processes can be \n\nsensitive to the geometric distribution of the components within the flow \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\n(BRENNEN, 2005) and, therefore, require a fully coupled solution. The \n\ninterface between phases can take on a variety of configurations, known \n\nas flow patterns (CHENG et al., 1998). There are three basic approaches \nto estimate the pressure drop and void fraction in a production stream \n\nusing one-dimensional models: the homogeneous model, the separated \n\nflow model and the mechanistic model based on flow patterns. It should \n\nbe mentioned that the choice of approach to be adopted depends on the \n\nwell data available, such as trajectory, produced fluid type (vapor-liquid \n\nequilibrium study - PVT analysis), tubing diameter, and operational data \n\nfrom drill stem test, among others.   \n\nThe simplest approach to model multiphase flows is the \n\nhomogeneous flow model, which considers the fluids intimately mixed, \n\nso they can be treated as a single-phase fluid with average properties. \n\nFlow patterns are, therefore, ignored in the homogeneous model. The \n\nintrinsic assumptions of the homogeneous model are as follows \n\n(CORRADINI, 1997): \n\n? The slip (relative) velocity between the phases is zero; \n\n? The two fluids are uniformly mixed and move as a pseudo fluid \nat the mixture velocity; \n\n? There is thermodynamic equilibrium between the phases.   \nThe flow patterns likely to take place in a vertical well producing \n\na gas-liquid mixture are shown in Figure 2.2 (COLLIER and THOME, \n\n1994). \n\nThe flow regimes shown in Figure 2.2 have been described based \n\non laboratory observations through transparent pipes. In order of \n\nincreasing gas content, the flow configurations in a vertical pipe are \n\nexplained as follows: \n\n? Bubbly flow: The liquid is the continuous phase. The low-\nvelocity gas or vapor phase is dispersed as uniformly distributed \n\nbubbles within the liquid. The two-phase static head is the main \n\ncomponent of the pressure gradient in a vertical conduit, as the \n\nfriction part is expected to be smaller due to the relatively low \n\nmixture velocity.  \n\n? Slug flow: The liquid is still the continuous phase, even though \nthe gas velocity is higher. The dispersed bubbles coalesce and \n\nform large bullet shaped bubbles (Taylor bubbles). A falling \n\nliquid film surrounds the Taylor bubbles. The so-called slug \n\nflow unit cell consists of two parts: the Taylor bubble region \n\nand the liquid slug region. The latter often contains small \n\ndispersed bubbles. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n? Churn flow: Both phases are continuous due to the breakdown \nof the liquid slugs as the gas velocity is increased. Liquid flow \n\nreversals (oscillatory motion) are the main features of this flow \n\nregime as the gas lacks enough momentum to move the liquid \n\nupwards. Interfacial friction plays an important role in \n\ndetermining the pressure drop in this flow regime.  \n\n? Annular flow: As the gas velocity increases, the flow becomes \nunidirectional (upward) and high interfacial shear gives rise to \n\ndroplet entrainment in the vapor core. A thin liquid film covers \n\nthe pipe wall, with liquid droplets being continuously entrained \n\nfrom and deposited back on the film. Due to the low liquid \n\ncontent associated with this flow regime, frictional effects are \n\nthe main component of the pressure gradient. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Different flow regimes in vertical pipe (COLLIER and THOME, \n\n1994). \n\n \n\nThe drift-flux model (ZUBER and FINDLAY, 1965) is a mixture \n\nmodel with a constitutive relationship for the relative motion between \n\nthe phases, which itself depends on the flow regime (COLLIER and \n\nTHOME, 1994). The drift-flux model can be extended to incorporate \n\nenergy transport effects (ISHII and HIBIKI, 2006). \n\nThe separated flow model considers each phase individually, for \n\nwhich individual mass, momentum and energy balance equations are \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\nformulated. The balance equations contain interaction terms to \n\nincorporate the interfacial transfer of mass, momentum and energy \n\nbetween the phases. Without these terms in the balance equations, the \n\ntwo phases are essentially independent and can be analyzed by single-\n\nphase flow equations (CORRADINI, 1997).  \n\nThe separated flow approach can be developed in two ways: from \n\nexperimentally based correlations or mechanistic modeling \n\n(POURAFSHARY, 2007). The experimentally based approach relies \n\nheavily on empirical correlations for the closure relationships needed in \n\nthe models. The other approach is based on mechanistic models to \n\ndescribe the distribution of the phases in the channel. This method \n\nconsists in recognizing the hydrodynamic conditions that lead to several \n\nflow patterns and proposes individual models for each flow regime to \n\npredict pressure losses and liquid hold up.  \n\nAs for the mechanistic models, Taitel and Dukler (1976) \n\npresented the first formulation for the transition between the five basic \n\nflow patterns in horizontal flow: stratified smooth, stratified wavy, \n\nintermittent, annular dispersed and dispersed bubble. Following that, \n\nthere have been several efforts to determine the dependence of the flow \n\npattern on component volume fluxes, volume fraction and the fluid \n\nproperties such as density, viscosity, and surface tension, for both \n\nvertical and horizontal tubes (ANSARI, 1994; GOMEZ, 1999; HASAN \n\nand KABIR, 1999; ZHANG et al, 2006). The results are often displayed \n\nin the form of a flow regime map, which identifies the flow patterns \n\noccurring in various parts of a parameter space defined, for instance, by \n\nthe superficial phase velocities or momentum fluxes. \n\nBriefly explaining, in order of increasing complexity, the \n\nhomogeneous model assumes no slippage between the phases and \n\nmakes no distinction between flow patterns. The separated flow model \n\nconsiders different phase velocities (slip) and requires an additional \n\nequation for the void fraction. However, it does not consider explicitly \n\ndifferent flow patterns. Mechanistic models incorporate mathematical \n\nrelationships for the transition between flow patterns in addition to \n\ngoverning equations for each specific flow pattern.  \n\nThe first wellbore multiphase flow model developments date \n\nback to 1930s. Early investigators developed very limited methods of \n\nmultiphase flow through vertical pipes as to their range of applications \n\n(VERSLUYS, 1930; MOORE and WILDE, 1931; MOORE and \n\nSCHILTHUIS, 1933; GOSLINE, 1936; MAY, 1935). Only in the \n\n1950s, the first empirical or semi-empirical models widely applicable in \n\nthe oil industry were proposed. Poettmann &amp; Carpenter (1952) \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\ndeveloped the first general method for predicting the pressure profile in \n\noil and gas wells and in gas lift vertical wells under steady state \n\nconditions, considering the flowing fluid as a single homogeneous \n\nphase. This semi-empirical model was based in field data of 49 wells \n\noperating over a wide range of conditions. Later, Baxendell &amp; Thomas \n\n(1961) proposed a new method to estimate the pressure profile in oil \n\nwells for high flow rate scenarios based on the methodology provided \n\nby Poettmann and Carpenter (1952).  \n\nFauncher and Brown (1963) developed a separated flow friction-\n\ncorrelation based model. Duns and Ross (1963) also provided a \n\nseparated flow model. This model, which was based on experimental \n\nwork, showed good agreement for all range of tested conditions. \n\nHagedorn and Brown (1965) developed a separated flow \n\nfriction/holdup-correlation model based on experimental work. The \n\nmodel was validated with several field data showing a very good \n\nagreement for the whole range of conditions.  \n\nBrill et al. (1966) provided a model combining the use of vertical \n\nand horizontal correlations for determining the maximum flow rate \n\npossible from both flowing and gas lift wells. Mukherjee and Brill \n\n(1983) developed experimental correlations for multiphase flow in \n\nvertical and inclined pipes.  \n\nIn the last ten years, several coupled thermal multiphase flow \n\nmodels in wellbores were developed (AMARA et al., 2006; IZGEC et \n\nal., 2007; POURAFSHARY et al., 2007; HU et al., 2007; LIVESCU et \nal., 2008; LIVESCU et al., 2009; SHIRDEL and SEPEHRNOORI, \n\n2009; PAN and OLDENBURG, 2014; FOROUZANFAR et al., 2015), \n\nwith the ultimate goal providing a coupled wellbore/reservoir solution. \n\nSome of these studies focused on the determination of the pressure and \n\ntemperature profile of the production stream, emphasizing the local heat \n\nand pressure loss in the interface wellbore-formation in a vertical, \n\ndeviated and/or horizontal well. \n\n2.1.2 Heat transfer models in wellbores \n\nThe wellbore is essentially a multi-layer cylindrical system with a \n\nmulti-mode radial heat transfer between the wellbore fluid and the \n\nsurrounding formation (HASAN and KABIR, 2002), as depicted in \n\nFigure 2.3 for production through a single string (SHOUSHTARI et al., \n\n2012 after INCROPERA et al., 2007). \n \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Wellbore architecture as a thermal resistance network. \n\n \n\nFor such configuration, the overall heat transfer coefficient (based \n\non the tubing external surface heat exchange area) can be defined by the \n\nfollowing expression (HASAN and KABIR, 2012): \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n\n   \n       \n\n \n      (      ? )\n\n  \n \n\n   \n    (     )\n\n \n      (      ? )\n\n  \n \n\n      (      ? )\n\n    \n   \n\n(2.1) \n\n \n\nwhich can be modified by adding or removing thermal resistances to \n\nadapt the thermal circuit to a particular situation. It should be noted that \n\nin Eq. 2.1 the interfacial contact resistances were neglected. In addition \n\nto the conduction from the inner radius,    , to the wellbore radius (outer \nradius),    , the composite system approach takes into account the \ninternal and external convective heat transfer represented by the first and \n\nthe third terms on the right-hand side of Eq. 2.1, where     is the outer \nradius of the tubing,     is the inner radius of the casing and     is the \nouter radius of the casing. \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nThe first heat transfer studies that attempted to estimate the \n\nwellbore fluid temperatures were proposed by Lesem et al. (1957) and \n\nMoss and White (1959) for long-time water injection operations, and \n\nwith the ultimate target of improving oil recovery. The classical work of \n\nRamey (1962) can be considered a landmark in the field, being used as \n\nthe reference for major works until today. In his study, Ramey (1962) \n\nproposed a transient 1-D approximate solution to predict the temperature \n\nof fluids, tubing and casings as a function of depth and \n\nproduction/injection time. The single string wellbore is considered as a \n\nvertical cylindrical heat source that loses heat to the surrounding \n\nformation, which, in turn, is treated as a homogeneous semi-infinite \n\nsolid. Boundary conditions include a known flow rate and a surface or a \n\nbottomhole temperature, besides considering a vanishingly small well \n\nradius and a prescribed temperature at the formation. The so-called \n\nformation temperature is the geothermal (undisturbed) temperature, i.e., \n\na function of depth. Ramey modeled the rock formation using the one-\n\ndimensional heat diffusion equation: \n\n \n\n     \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n  \n \n\n        \n\n   \n\n    \n\n  \n   (2.2) \n\n \n\nwhere     is the formation temperature,    , is the formation density, \n\n     , is the formation specific heat and    , is the thermal conductivity \n\nof the formation. Thus, the formation thermal diffusivity is defined as \n\n \n\n    \n         \n\n   \n   (2.3) \n\n \n\nThe boundary conditions applied to Eq. 2.2 considering a radial \n\nsymmetry are given by \n\n \n\n,\n\n   |            \n    \n  \n\n|       \n (2.4) \n\n \n\nRamey (1962) applied the solution of transient heat diffusion \n\navailable in Carslaw and Jaeger (1959) for a constant heat flux \n\ncylindrical heat source, for which the interface temperature between \n\nwellbore and formation shows a log-linear behavior for long production \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\ntimes (high Fourier number). The solution is based on a transient \n\ndiffusion temperature function,  ( ), which can be related to the heat \ntransfer rate from the flowing fluid to the formation using the following \n\nequation as \n\n \n\n   \n     (         )  \n\n ( )\n   (2.5) \n\n \n\nwhere     represents the wellbore/formation interface temperature and \nis defined as \n\n \n\n    \n(         )  (         ( )    )\n\n    (         ( ))\n    (2.6) \n\n \n\n      represents the initial formation temperature (defined by the \n\nformation geothermal gradient) and the transient temperature function is \n\nrewritten as \n\n \n\n ( )    \n?    \n\n   \n          (2.7) \n\n \n\nwhere     is the formation thermal diffusivity,     is the wellbore radius \n\nand the dimensionless time function,   ,which represents the transient \ndiffusion time,  , as follows \n\n  \n\n   \n     \n\n   \n    (2.8) \n\n \n\nIt is important to restate that Eq. 2.7 is valid only for production \n\ntimes longer than 7 days according to Ramey (1962). Although useful \n\nfor estimating wellbore temperatures during injection of hot fluid, the \n\ncalculation method is based on many assumptions. For instance, it does \n\nnot take into account phase change during the fluid flow, which has \n\nbeen corrected by Satter (1967), who included steam condensation \n\nduring the calculations. \n\nWillhite (1967) proposed a procedure to quantify the overall heat \n\ntransfer coefficient based on the radial thermal resistances of each \n\ndifferent layer in the wellbore, which was assumed known until then. To \n\nestimate the annuli natural convection coefficients, Willhite suggested \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nusing results from the study of Dropkin &amp; Sommerscales (1965) about \n\nnatural convection heat transfer between enclosed vertical plates, \n\nassuming that the annuli curvatures were negligible. The radiative heat \n\ntransfer coefficient was determined from Stefan-Boltzmann\u2019s Law, \n\nconsidering an infinite concentric annulus. \n\nRamey (1962) and Willhite (1967) pointed out that heat \n\ntransmission from wellbores to the formation never actually reaches \n\nsteady state, since a quasi-steady state is attained in which the rate of \n\nheat transfer per unit length monotonically decreases as a function of \n\ntime. The dimensionless time function,   , proposed by Ramey, is a \nmeasure of how fast the rock formation conducts heat away from the \n\nwellbore. The overall heat transfer coefficient is time dependent, \n\nreflecting the variable effective thermal resistance of the rock formation. \n\nRaymond (1969) developed one of the first fully-transient models for \n\nwellbore heat transfer. This method was later improved with an \n\nadvanced algorithm for the solution of the discretized equations \n\n(MARSHALL and BENTSEN, 1982).  \n\nEickmeier et al. (1970) proposed a finite difference model to \n\ninvestigate transient wellbore temperatures during early times of \n\ninjection or production (low Fourier numbers). The model considers \n\nmany assumptions, such as constant heat transfer coefficient and thermal \n\nproperties. Squier et al. (1970) provided an exact solution for early time \n\ninjection of hot fluid into the reservoir. Again, strong assumptions were \n\napplied in the model that such as neglecting any thermal resistance in \n\nthe wellbore. \n\nAfter Kirkpatrick (1959), Shiu and Beggs (1980) proposed an \n\nempirical method for predicting temperature profiles in two-phase \n\nflowing wells based on field data from 270 wells. Xiao (1987) \n\ndeveloped a simple equation for estimating the temperature profile of a \n\nflowing fluid in the wellbore considering many severe assumptions, \n\nsuch as constant fluid and solid properties. Yet, the results showed good \n\nagreement with field data from 14 onshore wells. \n\nWu and Pruess (1990) presented an analytical approach to solve \n\nthe wellbore heat transfer in a layered formation with different thermal \n\nproperties without introducing the simplifications of Ramey (1962), \n\nnamely, neglecting the transient term in the heat balance in the tubing \n\nand ignoring temperature history effects on the heat losses. For this \n\nreason, Ramey\u2019s method is suitable for simulating the heat transfer only \n\nfor long periods (high Fourier numbers). \n\nSagar et al. (1991) developed a method based on Coulter and \n\nBardon\u2019s (1970) model that incorporated Ramey's and Willhite's heat \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\ntransfer mechanisms for wellbore with multiphase flow, while taking \n\ninto account the kinetic energy and the Joule-Thompson expansion. The \n\nmodel, developed with temperature field data from 392 wells, assumes \n\nsteady state heat transfer in the wellbore. Later, Alves et al. (1992), \n\nbased on the same studies, i.e. Coulter and Bardon (1970) and Ramey \n\n(1962), developed a unified equation for predicting flowing temperature \n\nprofiles in wellbores for the entire range of inclinations. In this work, \n\nthey applied more rigorously assumptions regarding the thermodynamic \n\nbehavior of the flowing fluid \u2013 for instance, the Joule-Thompson effect \n\nwas properly accounted for.   \n\nAgain, turning attention to the heat loss to the rock formation, \n\nChiu &amp; Thakur (1991) developed a semi-analytical model, which can \n\ndetermine the heat losses from deviated wells. The model provided a \n\nnew transient diffusion dimensionless time function  \n\n  \n\n ( )         (        )  (2.9) \n \n\nand assumed steady state heat transfer in the wellbore. \n\nHasan &amp; Kabir (1991) used a rigorous model based on the \n\nsolution of the partial differential equation resulting from an energy \n\nbalance on the formation. The solution was carried out using the Laplace \n\nTransform for a constant heat flow from the wellbore to the formation. \n\nA variation on the heat flow along the production time can be added to \n\nthe model applying the principle of superposition. Furthermore, the \n\nauthors proposed a new transient diffusion temperature function and \n\ncompared the two solutions with those from Ramey\u2019s model. The \n\napproximate solution presented good agreement with the rigorous one \n\nfor very low and high Fourier numbers. For the case that the \n\ndimensionless time meets values between 0.01 and 5, the dimensionless \n\ntemperature deviates by 6%.  \n\nHasan and Kabir (1994) proposed a new procedure to estimate \n\nthe overall heat transfer coefficient adapting Willhite\u2019s work, by \n\ndeveloping a novel correlation for the natural convection heat transfer \n\ncoefficient and neglecting the thermal resistance due to the flowing \n\nfluid. The correlation was proposed based on an adaptation of the \n\nDropkin and Somerscales (1965) relationship for natural convection \n\nbetween parallel plates (5 x 10\n4\n&lt;Ra &lt;7.17 x 10\n\n8\n) \n\n \n\n   \n      (     )\n\n \n ?            \n\n       (\n    \n\n    ? )\n   (2.10) \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\n \n\nHasan et al. (1996) and Kabir et al. (1996) developed a \n\ngeneralized analytical model capable of predicting the circulating fluid \n\ntemperature during drilling, workover and well control operations. \n\nHasan et al. (1997) proposed a non-isothermal wellbore model coupled \n\nto an analytical reservoir approach. \n\nAn extension of the Ramey\u2019s wellbore heat transfer method, also \n\napplicable to the early stages of formation heating process (small \n\nFourier numbers), was proposed by Hagoort (2004). Cheng et al. (2011) \n\ndeveloped a new formation heat transfer model taking into account the \n\nwellbore heat capacity and, so a new analytical transient heat conduction \n\ntemperature function was proposed.  \n\n \n\n ( )    ( ?  )        \n\n \n \n\n   \n[  (  \n\n \n\n \n*    (   )        ]   \n\n(2.11) \n\n \n\nwhere   is the ratio of the formation heat capacity and the wellbore heat \ncapacity as follows: \n\n \n\n  \n(   )  \n\n(   )  \n\n (2.12) \n\n \n\nThey observed that the wellbore heat capacity has a considerable \n\ninfluence on the transient diffusion time function, mainly for short time \n\nsteam injection. Moreover, they found that the new analytical time \n\nfunction depends on the dimensionless time and the ratio between the \n\nformation heat capacity and the wellbore heat capacity. Later, Nian et al. \n\n(2014) compared the most traditional  ( ) functions with the one \nproposed by Cheng (2011). The results were validated with field data \n\nshowing the importance of the wellbore heat capacity on the accuracy of \n\nthe heat loss to the formation. \n\nBahonar et al. (2009) proposed a 2-D heat diffusion numerical \nmodel to deal with the formation transient heat transfer, aiming to \n\nestimate oil recovery with steam injection. One year later, Bahonar et al. \n(2010) compared several formation temperature treatment approaches \n\n(two numerical and three analytical approaches) and showed that the 2-\n\nD numerical model can better predict casing and interface temperatures \n\nespecially at the top and bottom well boundaries. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\n \n\nRecently, Xiong et al. (2015) proposed a new correlation to \n\naccount for the natural convection in the annulus, based on a FLUENT \n\nCFD study, expressed as  \n\n \n\n   \n       (\n\n    \n\n    \n)\n      \n\n      \n      \n\n  \n   \n\n(2.13) \n\n \n\nSimulations were performed in steady-state using typical \n\napproaches used to deal with natural convection between two long \n\ncylinders, as shown in Figure 2.4. The maximum mismatch error \n\nbetween the correlation proposed and the CFD results was 6.7%. \n\nHowever, for the other approaches performed this error was larger than \n\n100% in some cases. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Comparison between annulus gap approaches for predicting \n\nconvection heat transfer (Xiong et al., 2015). \n\n \n\n2.1.3 Tubular and Formation Mechanical Models \n\nConcerning the mechanical approaches used to assess the \n\nwellbore integrity, Klementich and Jellison (1986) were one of the first \n\nauthors to develop a more robust stress analysis of the wellbore. Based \n\non the widely accepted criterion for yielding of ductile, homogeneous \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\nand isotropic materials, the Henky-von Mises theory, the mathematical \n\nstatement of this theory considers that the expressions for the hoop and \n\nradial stresses are derived from Lam\u00e9\u2019s equations for stresses in a thick-\n\nwalled cylinder. Hence, the change in hoop strain,    , is calculated \nusing Hooke\u2019s law as follows:  \n\n \n\n    \n[      (       )]\n\n \n       (2.14) \n\n \n\nwhere   is the Young\u2019s modulus\n1\n,   is the Poisson\u2019s ratio\n\n2\n,   is \n\ncoefficient of linear thermal expansion,      and     are the radial and \nhoop stresses and     is the axial stress, calculated according to the \nlocal geometric configuration of the wellbore. \n\nFrom there, the American Petroleum Institute (API) provided a \n\nset of formulas and calculations for wellbore tubulars aiming to \n\nstandardize the stress-loading analysis (API Bulletin 5C3, 1989). Adams \n\nand MacEachran (1991) extended the work of Klementich and Jellison \n\n(1986) for a multilayer casing wellbore scenario, namely the multistring \n\nmodel. Using a multistring approach means that the annuli are \n\ninterrelated, so the deformation of an annulus will affect the other ones. \n\nThus, the annular volume variation due to the fluid expansion and \n\ntubular deformation assuming radial symmetry and homogeneous \n\nisotropic properties of each annulus present in the wellbore can be \n\ncalculated as follows: \n\n \n\n     ?[(   \n        )  (   \n\n        )]        (2.15) \n\n \n\nwhere    and    are the outer and inner radii of the annulus, respectively; \nwhile    denotes the variation of the radius of each tubular wall.     is \nthe volume change due to annulus axial dimensions variation resulting \n\nfrom expansion or contraction of annulus walls. \n\nHalal and Mitchell (1994) proposed a model for multilayer string \n\nthat accounted for the interaction between axial stresses and heat up \n\n                                                             \n1\n Young\u2019s Modulus \u2013 also known as the elastic modulus, is a measure of \n\nelasticity, equal to the ratio of the stress acting on a material to the strain \n\nproduced. \n2\n  Poisson\u2019s ratio \u2013 is the signed ratio of transverse strain to axial strain. In \n\nother words, is the amount of transversal expansion divided by the amount \n\nof axial compression, for small values of these changes. \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\npressures, and that included the effects of nonlinear fluid behavior as a \n\nfunction of temperature, pressure, and composition. The authors \n\nconsidered two different scenarios to compute    , cemented and \nuncemented intervals, as depicted in Figure 2.5. Also, a \n\ncement/formation interface section is also illustrated. \n\nFor uncemented intervals that are fixed at both ends (i.e. casing \n\nhanger and TOC),     is a function of the pressure variation and the \nfluid densities, besides the mechanical properties and geometric \n\ncharacteristics as follows: \n \n\n    \n  [   (           )     (           )]\n\n(       )\n          \n\n(2.16) \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Wellbore arrangements: (a) cemented interval, (b) \n\ncement/formation interface (modified from Halal and Mitchell, 1994). \n\n \n\nWhen an annulus is formed between cemented tube walls \n\n(cemented interval), then     is obtained from the condition that each \npoint is axially fixed, in other words,      , which yields: \n\n \n\n    \n  (             )\n\n(       )\n           (2.17) \n\n \n\nFinally, to close the equation system, the variation in hoop strain \n\nat the cement/formation interface evaluated for the formation assumes \n\nthe form: \n\n  \n\n    \n(     )     \n\n   \n    (2.18) \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere     denotes the pressure variation at the cement/formation \ninterface and     and     are the formation mechanical properties.  \n\nHalal and Mitchell (1994) suggested a matrix formulation to deal \n\nwith the continuity of the stress distribution between the solids in order \n\nto estimate the volumetric annulus variation. The pressure distribution at \n\neach interface between the different wellbore elements was performed \n\nadopting a tridiagonal matrix algorithm. The integrated model \n\npredictions were compared with results from single-string analyses \n\ndemonstrating the strong interaction between casing strings. \n\nOudeman and Bacarreza (1995) evaluated the effect of the \n\nformation response on the wellbore in the particular case where the \n\ninner casing was not cemented into the shoe of the outer casing. In this \n\nscenario, the fluid leak off to the formation drives the pressure build up \n\nbehavior. Later, Oudeman and Kerem (2006) developed an experimental \n\nmethod to predict the pressure increase behavior in confined annuli \n\nunder transient conditions. The method was able to provide some \n\ninsights about the annulus build up pressure over time.   \n\n Sathuvalli et al. (2005) advanced a more rigorous model \n\nincluding the role of formation elasticity on the APB, considering the \n\nrock formation as an elastic foundation. In this case, the cement sheath \n\noutside the casing was treated as part of the formation due to the fact \n\nthat the elastic constants were on same order of magnitude. Hence, this \n\napproach avoids an additional unknown quantity, i.e. the pressure \n\nchanges in the formation near the wellbore, which arose from the Halal \n\nand Mitchell (1994) approach.   \n\nRecently, Hafemann et al. (2015) adopted the same multistring \n\napproach to predict the interface pressures using the GMRES \n\n(generalized Minimal Residual) method to solve the resulting system of \n\nlinear equations. Barcelos et al. (2017) improved Hafemann\u2019s model \n\nassuming that each annulus behaves as a pressure vessel. As the mass in \n\neach annulus does not change, considering that annuli are fully closed, \n\nafter running the thermal model, the resulting annulus average \n\ntemperature is used to compute the pressure variation due to the fluid \n\nexpansion.  \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2 APB Behavior Prediction and Field History \n\nAs previously discussed, annular pressure buildup (APB) can be \n\nunderstood as the increase in pressure due to thermal expansion of fluids \n\nconfined in one or more annuli within a wellbore.  However, a more \n\ngeneral definition of APB is provided by the Global Standards from the \n\nInternational Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) in 2010 (API \n\nSTD 65 \u2013 Part 2): \n\n \n\n\u201cPressure generated within a sealed annulus by thermal \n\nexpansion of trapped wellbore fluids typically during production. May \n\nalso occur during drilling operations when trapped annular fluids at \ncool shallow depths are exposed to high temperatures from fluids \n\ncirculating in deep, hot hole sections. This thermally induced pressure is \n\ndefined and listed in API RP 90 as thermal casing pressure. APB is also \nreferred to as annular fluid expansion (AFE)\u201d. \n\n \n\nDue to the increase in the APB scenarios in the last years with the \n\ndevelopment of extreme water depths and hole depth in many modern \n\noffshore wells, IADC proposed a new definition of APB (API RP 96): \n\n \n\n\u201cPressure generated within an annulus by thermal expansion of \nwellbore fluids, typically during production\u201d.  \n\n \n\nHowever, two notes followed the definition: the first one is that \n\nthe APB can also occur during drilling operations when trapped annular \n\nfluids at cool shallow depths are exposed to high temperatures induced \n\nby fluids circulating from deep, hot hole sections. This thermally \n\ninduced pressure is defined and listed in API RP 90 as thermal casing \n\npressure. The second one stated that the APB can also occur from \n\nmigration of formation fluids, as defined in API RP 90. \n\nAlthough there is a vast literature on the physics of APB \n\n(ADAMS and MACEACHRAN, 1991; BELLARBY, 2009, \n\nHAFEMANN 2015), and most theoretical aspects has been explored \n\n(HALAL and MITCHELL, 1994; SATHUVALLI et al., 2005; \nOUDEMAN and KEREM, 2006; HASAN and KABIR 2012; YIN and \n\nGAO, 2014, HAFEMANN, 2015) there is still lack of a comprehensive \n\napproach that accurately predicts the multilayer APB magnitude.  \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\nAccording to Sathuvalli et al. (2016), the boundary conditions \n\nand the fluid thermo behavior determine the type and the stiffness\n3\n of \n\nthe wellbore annuli. The pressure increase is essentially the outcome of \n\nhow each wellbore annulus behaves as heat is transferred from the \n\nflowing fluid to the formation, and how each annulus mechanically \n\nreacts when subjected to this thermal effect. \n\nChanges in the containment volume alleviate the annular pressure \n\ndue to ballooning or reverse ballooning, and thermal dilation/contraction \n\nof the casing strings. The pressure in the annulus may also be reduced \n\nby bleeding the inner fluid from the annulus at the wellhead or leaking \n\nthrough the formation bellow an open casing shoe, as seen in Figure 2.6 \n\n(BELLARBY, 2009). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Determining factors of the APB (BELLARBY, 2009). \n\n \n\nDespite beliefs that open shoes can ensure annular fluid bleed off \n\n(PELIANO et al., 2014), some authors claim that the sedimentation of \nsolids in the drilling fluids creates a non-permeable layer above on top \n\nof cement that prevents fluid flow to the formation (ZAMORA and \n\nBELL, 2004; OMLAND, 2009).   \n\n                                                             \n3\n Stiffness \u2013 The annulus stiffness is a measure of the expected pressure \n\nincrease in the annulus fluid per unit increase of temperature (Sathuvalli et \n\nal. (2016). \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\nAPB can be quantified by the following equation (Eq. 2.19), \n\nwhich relates the change in pressure to changes in the mass of the \n\nconfined fluid, volume and temperature of the annulus (OUDEMAN and \n\nBACAREZZA, 1995): \n\n \n\n   (\n  \n\n  \n*\n   \n\n    (\n  \n\n  \n*\n   \n\n    (\n  \n\n  \n*\n   \n\n     (2.19) \n\n  \n\nwhere the first term represents a change in pressure due to fluid leakage \n\nto the formation, the second term represents the change in pressure \n\ncaused by changes in annulus containment that is induced by thermal or \n\nhydraulic loads on the tubing/casing and the third one represents the \n\nincrease in pressure as the temperature increases assuming a constant \n\nvolume. After manipulation, Eq. 2.19 can be rewritten in the following \n\nform (OUDEMAN and KEREM, 2006): \n\n \n\n   \n   \n\n     \n \n\n  \n\n    \n \n\n     \n\n  \n    (2.20) \n\n \n\nwhere    is the fluid compressibility coefficient,    is the fluid volume \n\nin the annular space,   is the annulus volume, and    is the thermal \n\nexpansion coefficient of the annulus fluid. \n\nAccording to Oudeman and Kerem (2006), in a sealed annular, \n\nthe third term is usually dominant and the second term is on the order of \n\n10 to 20% of the third term. Hasan and Kabir (2009) stated that the third \n\nterm or pressure increase caused by liquid expansion accounts for well \n\nover 80% of the total APB in most cases. Halal &amp; Mitchell (1994) claim \n\nthat neglecting the second term most likely will lead in a non-reliable \n\ncalculation. \n\nIn a fully trapped annular, the first term in Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 can \n\nbe neglected since the amount of annular liquid fluid does not change. \n\nThus, the APB depends basically on the two last terms of Equation 2.20. \n\nBy knowing the magnitude of the fluid volume change and the \n\nmechanical response of the annular to pressure and temperature changes, \n\nthe magnitude of APB in one or more annuli can be calculated. Bellarby \n\n(2009) named the limit load in the annulus as MAASP \u2013 Maximum \n\nAllowable Annular Surface Pressure, which can be related to the tubular \n\ncollapse or burst resistance.  \n\nEven though the root cause of the problem arises from a thermal \n\nprocess, the outcome is strictly structural, hence, the importance of \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\ndeveloping a comprehensive multiphysics model to deal with it. While \n\nconceptually simple, there are huge challenges concerning the APB \n\nquantification. In fact, the level of accuracy of an APB model depends \n\nstrongly on each of its constituting models, the assumptions regarding \n\nfluid and formation properties and the numerical mesh size. Sathuvalli et \n\nal. (2005) stated that most industry standard wellbore thermal simulators \nincluded an uncertainty of at least \u00b1 3 K and another source of \n\nuncertainty came from the fluid thermal physical properties calculation.  \n\nRecent works attempted to estimate APB both analytically and \n\nnumerically. Many assumptions have been stated making the solution \n\nmethod less accurate, such as: use of single-phase flow model, steady \n\nstate condition, use of constant thermophysical properties, neglecting the \n\ndeformation of tubes, disregard the wellbore thermal capacity to \n\nquantify the  ( ) function, among others.  \nHasan et al. (2010) presented two approaches to estimate the \n\nAPB assuming a transient and a quasi-steady formulation to model the \n\nheat transfer in the wellbore. However, both models disregarded the \n\nstructural changes in the wellbore due to the deformation of the tubes. \n\nAlcofra (2014) developed a wellbore thermal model that considered a \n\nmultistring approach to deal with annuli volume and pressure changes \n\ndue to heat transmission from a single-phase oil flow under steady state \n\ncondition.  \n\nHafemann (2015) developed a numerical approach that overcame \n\nseveral limitations encountered in previous models, including: \n\n? a steady-state flow pattern-based multiphase flow model; \n\n? a compositional model to calculate the changes in hydrocarbon \nproperties; \n\n? a transient heat transfer model that used a  ( ) function based \non the heat capacity of the wellbore; \n\n? a multistring approach to deal with annuli volume and pressure \nchange; \n\n? variable thermodynamic properties of the annular fluids; \n\n? different types of rock formations. \n \n\nEven though the work of Hafemann et al. (2015) has shown \nmeaningful advances with respect to the thermo-hydraulic coupling and \n\nthe structural modeling of the wellbore, it was only in the subsequent \n\nwork of Barcelos et al. (2017) that a practical way of calculating APB \n\nwas successfully implemented. In the latter study, a new approach was \n\nproposed based on the formulation of Oudeman and Kerem (2004) that \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\nconsidered each annulus is treated as an integral volume (pressure vessel \n\napproach), so that the pressure change in the annulus caused by local \n\nvolume variation is assumed to be transmitted throughout each annulus \n\ninstantly. In other words, despite computing local volume deformations, \n\nthe increase in pressure was calculated for entire annulus and updated \n\nevery time step.  \n\n  \n\n2.3 APB Mitigation \n\nAPB issues are dealt with carefully, depending on the scenario. \n\nManaging procedures and/or mitigation techniques are often required as \n\nreported by Nelson (2002). Accidents arising from pressure increase in \n\nannulus are essentially a consequence of an unsuitable well design \n\ncaused by a thermal behavior that was not anticipated and/or an \n\nundersized equipment application. The consequences can be \n\ncatastrophic, ranging from well losses and severe environmental damage \n\nto the loss of human lives.  \n\nIn onshore wells and offshore platforms, the \u201cChristmas tree\u201d is \n\nable to alleviate the annulus pressure by bleeding off through the surface \n\naccessible wellhead equipment. However, in subsea offshore wells, the \n\nprimary annulus formed by the tubing and production casing is the only \n\none accessible. All other annuli are sealed and do not allow bleeding \n\n(VARGO et al., 2003; WILLIAMSON et al., 2003).  \n\nBased on the above, two conditions are required for the APB \n\nphenomenon to take place: an increase in temperature due to \n\nhydrocarbon production and the presence of sealed annulus filled by \n\npacker/drilling fluid. While pressure buildup in the annular is a common \n\noccurrence, regardless whether the annulus is sealed or not, casing \n\nfailure will only occur if the annulus is confined and the pressure \n\nincrease exceeds the casing mechanical resistance. This condition is \n\ncommonly present in all subsea producing wells, but it is most evident \n\nin deepwater environments. Deepwater wells are more vulnerable to \n\nAPB because of the cold seafloor temperatures (below 280 K), which \n\ncontrast with the high subsea wellhead temperatures that commonly \n\nrange from 340 to 400 K during hydrocarbon production. \nIn order to avoid the tube collapse, several strategies are \n\ncommonly used to mitigate APB as reviewed in (PATTILLO, 2011; \n\nMOE and ERPELDING, 2000; WILLIAMSON et al., 2003). For \ninstance, the following equation presented by Ellis et al. (2004) \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\ndescribes the important parameters that can be varied in the design of a \n\nwell to reduce APB, considering the annular space as a rigid container: \n\n \n\n   (\n           \n\n  \n)  \n\n \n\n  \n    (2.21) \n\n \n\nwhere    is the annulus pressure variation,    is the fluid thermal \n\nexpansion coefficient,    is the temperature variation,    is the initial \nvolume of the fluid,    is the volume change and    is the fluid \n\ncompressibility coefficient. Equation 2.21 shows that fluid properties \n\nand change in volume and temperature are important parameters to \n\ncontrol the APB. In fact, the change in volume depends on the fluid \n\nproperties, which in turn also affects the heat transfer process and the \n\ntemperature difference.  \n\nThe many alternatives to avoid well failure due to APB were \n\nclassified below according to their working principle: \n\n? Enhanced tubular design: this strategy focuses on the increase \nin casing capability to accommodate a higher pressure level \n\nbuildup without a negative effect on the wellbore. Several \n\nstudies provide advances in probabilistic performance \n\nproperties of tubulars and so, upgrade the tubing and casing to \n\nwithstand the loads (ROSLAND et al., 2013; \n\nSHAHREYARAND and FINLEY, 2014). \n\n? Annulus flexibility: the objective here is to create a preferred \nleak path or bleed port. Casing rupture-disk technology allows a \n\ncasing design to fail in a predictable condition. The disk is set \n\nin the casing and the wellbore is designed to vent outward \n\nrather than collapse inward. Extensive testing and design \n\noptimization of rupture disks have been performed associated \n\nwith this application (VARGO et al., 2003; SANTOS et al. \n2015). A rougher, but efficient strategy one may treat the casing \n\nperforating a hole to relieve the pressure to a non-permeable \n\nzone or even drill a hole at the wellhead with a world class \n\nROV\n4\n and special tools, allowing the expanded fluid escape to \n\nthe sea (DOS SANTOS et al. 2012).  \n\n                                                             \n4\n ROV \u2013 Remotely operated underwater vehicle is a submersible vehicle \n\nremotely operated by a person onboard in a drilling rig. It is used to conduct \n\nand supervise operations in deep water environments.  \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n? Controlling gained volume: the purpose of this alternative is to \ncontrol the expanded volume by the trapped fluid as heating \n\noccurs. There are three ways to do this: the first one is the use \n\nof compressible fluids with a relatively small amount of \n\nnitrogen to absorb enough liquid volume expansion to prevent \n\ncasing failure. Another option is using a spacer fluid that \n\nshrinks with increasing temperature (BLOYS et al., 2007). The \n\nthird one deals with attaching crushable foam wrap to the outer \n\ncasing wall (SATHUVALLI et al., 2005). The syntactic foam \nconsists of hollow thin-walled glass microspheres composed of \n\nsodium borosilicate glass and filled with air at atmospheric \n\npressure. When the annular pressure reaches a certain value, the \n\nhollow spheres collapse generating an extra volume in the \n\nannular space and preventing further pressure increase from \n\nexpansion. \n\n? Application of insulation materials: this strategy aims to reduce \nthe radial heat transfer from the production string to the annuli. \n\nThe insulation can be the annular fluid such as the drilling \n\nand/or packer fluid or insulated tubes, for instance, the vacuum \n\ninsulated tubing (VIT). VIT systems are better used in scenarios \n\nthat require high insulation capacity. However, many \n\ndrawbacks and uncertainties follow the VIT application. Low \n\nthermal conductivity aqueous-based packer fluids have been \n\nused in less severe APB scenarios in deepwater environments \n\n(JAVORA et al., 2002; ERIKSEN et al., 2014). Osgouei et al. \n(2014) proposed a set of guidelines to improve the insulation \n\nperformance of annular fluids (drilling fluids) based on its \n\nrheological behavior.  \n\nSathuvalli et al. (2005) developed a screening procedure and a \n\ncomputational tool to allow an examination of operational scenarios and \n\nidentification of the key parameters that control the APB phenomenon. \n\nSantos et al. (2015) offered a good explanation about the several APB \n\nmitigation techniques, outlining design procedures and illustrating \n\nguidelines for application scenarios. \n\n   \n\n2.4 VIT Basics \n\nThe VIT technique consists of an inner production tubing welded \n\nto an outer tube at both ends, forming an annular cavity that is evacuated \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\n(see Figure 2.7), with the aim of minimizing the radial heat transfer \n\n(AZZOLA et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.7 \u2013 VIT connection details. \n\n \n\nThe manufacturing process of vacuum insulated tubes was \n\ndescribed by Bellarby (2009) as follows: before the tubings are welded, \n\na port is drilled in the outer tubing and an absorbent is added to the \n\nspace. Once welded, the space between the tubes is evacuated, heated to \n\nactivate the absorbent, filled with argon and then evacuated again. \n\nFinally, a vacuum plug is installed. However, there is a short section, \n\ntypically between 0.15 and 0.25 m at each coupling, which does not \n\nhave a cavity to be evacuated. Since the junction between every two \n\ntubes is not insulated, heat transfer can be significant at this location. \n\nThis section has a more serious impact on the overall heat loss than its \n\nrelative length as reported by Pattillo et al. (2004). Convection cells \nbuild up above each connection, transporting heat away from the \n\nconnection. \n\nVIT systems can be manufactured according to different material \n\nand dimensional specifications. Typical ranges of overall tubing length, \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n \n\ncoupling length, tubing diameters and tubing material of commercial \n\nVIT systems are shown in Table 2.1. \n\n  \nTable 2.1 \u2013 Typical dimensions of commercial VIT systems \n\nOverall length 6.096 to 12.192 m \n\nCoupling length 0.2540 to 0.1461 m \n\nOuter tubing external diameter \n0.178 to 0.089 m                        \n\n(7 to 3 \u00bd in) \n\nInner tubing internal diameter \n0.140 to 0.060 m                       \n\n(5 \u00bd to 2 3/8 in) \n\n \n\nIf the connections are effectively insulated, the equivalent thermal \n\nconductivity of VIT can be excellent, reducing by more than 60% the \n\nheat loss rate through the connection. This benefit can be reached using \n\na PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) or thin film (a modified liquid epoxy \n\ncoating) multilayer insulation (HORN and LIVELY, 2001), inside \n\nand/or outside the tubings, depending on the welding configuration. \n\nOverall conductivities will depend on the connection insulation, annular \n\nfluids and soil properties (AZZOLA et al., 2004). There are advantages \n\nand disadvantages of each VIT configuration, as shown in Figure 2.8, \n\nrelating mainly to cost, strength and quality control (BELLARBY, \n\n2009). Thus, it should be noted that the VIT joints are stacked \n\n(connected) one above the other until reaching the depth that it is desired \n\nto reduce the radial heat transfer. \n\nDespite the many years of experience on well insulation \n\ntechnologies applied to oil and gas production, the technical literature on \n\nVIT systems is still somewhat limited, with many unanswered questions \n\nconcerning its thermal performance, applicability and most relevant \n\nphysical mechanisms. For instance, aspects related to the effective \n\nthermal conductivity, heat loss through the connection and main body, \n\nand the impact of the vacuum level on thermal performance, need to be \n\nproperly quantified before VIT systems become consolidated in \n\nBrazilian offshore wells. \n\nFurthermore, VIT systems are expensive, heavy, take up a \nsignificant portion of the annular space and require high-strength \n\ntubulars due to high stresses on the tubular bodies and welds \n\n(BELLARBY, 2009; JAVORA et al., 2002; EZELL et al., 2010). Due \nto operational, engineering and cost constraints, the VIT joints are often \n\ncombined with bare tubings. Typically, VIT joints are installed from the \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nmudline to a chosen depth, which depends on the wellbore architecture \n\nand thermal and mechanical requirements (SATHUVALLI et al., 2016). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.8 \u2013 VIT configurations (BELLARBY, 2009). \n\n \n\n2.4.1 The k-value (U-value) concept \n\nFor simplicity, the petroleum industry has successfully adopted a \n\nsingle value to characterize the VIT insulation performance, which has \n\nbeen called k-value, an equivalent thermal conductivity of the VIT \nsystem (FEENEY, 1997; AZZOLA et al., 2004; AZZOLA et al., 2007; \n\nSINGH et al., 2005; FERREIRA et al., 2012; YUE et al., 2013; \n\nKARRA et al., 2014; AL SHAIBI, 2015), despite understanding that the \n\nactual k-value may vary along the length of the VIT. In fact, the VIT\u2019s \n\n\n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\nk-value and/or U-value (equivalent overall heat transfer coefficient of \n\nthe VIT) depends on the boundary conditions and may vary with annular \n\nfluid types and soil properties (AZZOLA et al., 2004). \nIt will be shown later in this section that the k-value has a \n\nsomewhat broader meaning than the thermal conductivity. While the \n\nlatter is a physical property of a given material, the k-value concept is \n\nused in the oil industry to quantify an equivalent thermal conductance \n\n(per unit length) of interconnected heat transfer processes between a \n\ngiven temperature difference. Although its definition is very similar to \n\nthat of the overall heat transfer coefficient, U, the k-value is the quantity \n\nused as a thermal performance indicator in wellbore thermal flow \n\nsimulators (Wellcat\u2122, OLGA\n\u00ae\n\n). \n\nThe main issue regarding the application of a single value of \n\nequivalent thermal conductivity to represent the thermal behavior of a \n\nVIT joint is that it frequently misrepresents the multidimensional nature \n\nof the temperature and heat transfer behavior in the connection section. \n\nSince the temperature distribution in the solid regions of the VIT in the \n\nvicinity of the connection section are affected by the local thermal \n\nconductances in the surrounding domains (e.g., natural convection and \n\nthe radiation in the annuli, forced convection in the production tubing), \n\nthe k-value becomes very much dependent on the well operating \n\nconditions. As a result, wellbore completion designers often consider \n\nhigh k-values in their completion projects to meet conservative pressure \n\nincrease estimates in their APB calculations. \n\n \n\n2.4.2 VIT thermal models \n\nFor a better description of the heat transfer in VIT systems, their \n\ngeometry is usually divided into two parts: the VIT body and the \n\nconnection. The VIT body consists basically of the two concentric tubes \n\nand the vacuum space, forming a thermally insulated region, through \n\nwhich the heat transfer rate per unit length is designed to be minimal. \n\nThe second part is the connection between the two VIT bodies. In this \n\nsection, there is no vacuum and, therefore, the heat loss to the \n\nsurrounding environment is expected to be much higher. Azzola et al. \n(2004) presented the heat paths through the VIT, as illustrated in Figure \n\n2.9. \n \n\n\n\n68 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Heat fluxes (arrows) in the VIT body and connection sections \n\n(modified from Azzola et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nThree different heat fluxes can be associated with the VIT \n\nsystem, as shown in Figure 2.9.      is the radial heat flux through the \nvacuum space,      is the radial heat flux through the connection and \n     is the axial heat flux through the tube walls. Given the high thermal \nresistance offered by the vacuum and the high thermal conductivity of \n\nthe steel tubes, the axial conduction heat flux      is created, allowing \nheat to travel from the inner tube wall towards the weld, then through \n\nthe weld and back towards the VIT\u2019s outer tube. The preferred path \n\nfollowed by the heat flux leads to a high heat loss through the \n\nconnection by convection to the external environment. Figure 2.10 \n\nhighlights such phenomenon and shows the behavior of the radial heat \n\nflux and the external temperature of the VIT surface as a function of the \n\ndistance from the center of the connection (PATTILLO et al., 2003). \n \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.10 \u2013 Radial heat flux and VIT outer surface temperature under forced \n\nconvection (Pattillo et al., 2003). \n \n\nAzzola et al. (2004) developed an analytical model to assess the \n\nVIT thermal performance. They assumed that      was governed by the \nradiation thermal resistance in the vacuum space. Additionally, since the \n\nconduction thermal resistance in the tube wall is much lower than the \n\noutside VIT connection thermal resistance,      is assumed to depend \nonly on the outside VIT connection thermal resistance (convection). On \n\nthe other hand, it is not straightforward to determine     , since the heat \nflux is directly affected by the size of the hot zone around the weld, \n\nwhich, in turn, is directly dependent on the magnitude of the convective \n\nheat loss through this region. Azzola et al. (2004) computed this heat \n\nflux through an analogy with an extended surface formulation \n\nconsidering an adiabatic-tip fin, which is a function of    (convection \nheat transfer coefficient of the fluid surrounding the fin),      (thermal \n\nconductivity of the fin) and the fin geometry. Hence, the fin thermal \n\nresistance itself is: \n\n \n\n         (         )  (2.22) \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nAlthough the heat transfer in the VIT shares some similarities \n\nwith an extended surface, the VIT performance is also a function of the \n\nvacuum equivalent thermal conductivity. Thus: \n\n \n\n         (          )  (2.23) \n \n\nThe equivalent thermal conductivity of the vacuum space was \n\ncalculated assuming a parallel arrangement between the thermal \n\nresistances associated with the residual air diffusion (pressure lower \n\nthan 13 Pa) driven by   , the thermal conductivity of the air and the \n\nradiation contribution, \n\n \n\n          (2.24) \n\n \n\nwhere the radiative equivalent thermal conductivity,   , is nonlinear \n\nwith respect to absolute temperature and can be estimated by (AZZOLA \n\net al., 2004): \n \n\n   \n    (       )  (   \n\n     \n )  (       )\n\n  \n  (2.25) \n\n \n\nSince the vacuum space in VIT systems frequently contains \n\naluminum foil wraps separated by glass fiber foils,    is a function of \nthe tubes surface emissivity,  , the absolute temperatures of the outer \nsurface of the inner tube and the inner surface of the outer tube and  , \nwhich is the number of reflective wraps. \n\nAzzola et al. (2004) also described the development of a two-\n\ndimensional axisymmetric finite-difference code to model the VIT \n\nthermal performance. The VIT geometry was divided into three regions, \n\nwhere the external convection heat transfer coefficient was assumed to \n\nbe uniform - at the coupling, weld region (0.0508 m in extent beyond \n\nweld), and VIT body. The scheme of the finite difference code exhibited \n\nby Azzola et al. (2004) is depicted in Figure 2.11. From the element \n\ndiscretization, the energy balance in the inner tube and in the outer tube \n\nwas performed. The heat balances took into account the transient heat \n\ntransfer, the axial heat diffusion through the tubing walls, the radial \n\nradiative heat transfer through the vacuum space and the internal or \n\nexternal convective heat transfer depending on where the energy balance \n\nis applied, if in the inner tube or the outer tube. \n\n \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.11 \u2013 Finite difference code discretization scheme (AZZOLA et al., \n\n2004). \n \n\nAzzola et al. (2004) proposed two definitions of the effective \nthermal conductivity of the VIT as follows: \n\n \n\n      \n     (      ? )\n\n   (     )\n (2.26) \n\n  \n\n      \n     (      ? )\n\n   (     )\n (2.27) \n\n \n\nIn Equation 2.26, the effective thermal conductivity was defined \n\nrelative to the outer diameter of the outer tube and the inner diameter of \n\nthe inner tube, while in Equation 2.27 it was defined relative to the inner \n\ndiameter of the outer tube and the outer diameter of the inner tube. It \n\nwas concluded that the       thermal property is a better parameter to \n\ncharacterize the VIT\u2019s effective thermal conductivity because, as the \n\nexternal thermal resistance increases, the insulation system performance \n\nexpressed by       converges to the vacuum value. Thus, by choosing \n\n      as a definition, it is easy to recognize how well the insulation \nsystem performs relative to an ideal performance level. The following \n\nequation was proposed by Azzola et al. (2004) to assess       meaning \n\nwith respect to a dimensionless external thermal resistance: \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n    \n    \n\n \n    \n\n        (       )\n (2.28) \n\n \n\nAlso, an expression to estimate the overall heat transfer \n\ncoefficient was also proposed by Azzola et al. (2004) based on the       \n\nvalue \n\n \n\n    \n      \n\n    (\n  \n\n  \n? )\n\n  (2.29) \n\n \n\n2.4.3 VIT thermal and mechanical evaluations \n\nDespite the numerous successful cases, one should recognize the \n\nmany challenges faced by oil companies to develop deepwater \n\nenvironment oilfields using VIT technologies. For instance, deepwater \n\nscenarios pose significant drawbacks for selecting suitable VIT tubulars \n\nto ensure long-term reliability under combined mechanical and thermal \n\nloads. \n\nEllis et al. (2002) performed an extensive study of the VIT \n\nthermal behavior in a full-scale experimental test facility - a VIT system \n\nconsisting of a 0.1397-m (5 \u00bd-in) OD, 0.1143-m (4 \u00bd-in) ID tubing was \n\nused. The experiments were able to determine average and local values \n\nof the overall heat transfer coefficients of the VIT system. Several \n\nconfigurations of the VIT were tested varying the coupling insulation \n\nand annuli fluid type. Results showed that the heat loss at the coupling \n\ndrives the thermal performance of a VIT joint. Additionally, the authors \n\nconcluded that, for this case, the VIT without coupling insulators could \n\nnot be employed in the remaining wells of the Marlin field in the Gulf of \n\nMexico. \n\nGosch et al. (2004) used the test results obtained by Ellis et al. \n(2002) to design a suitable VIT system and described the methodology \n\nto install VITs and monitor the pressure and temperature behavior using \n\nfiber optic gauges in the remaining Marlin field wells in the Gulf of \n\nMexico. \n\nMechanical loads over the VIT were studied before by Pattillo et \n\nal. (2003) and Nowinka et al. (2005). The interrelation of the inner and \nouter tube, constrained at the weld, induces internal loads in the VIT \n\njoint that are foreign to conventional tubing design. Figure 2.12 presents \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n \n\na basic VIT configuration with the thread on the outer tube (NOWINKA \n\net al., 2005). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.12 \u2013 A basic VIT configuration with the thread on the outer tube \n\n(NOWINKA et al., 2005). \n \n\nAnother challenge faced by VIT system designers is the increase \n\nin axial load due to the large weight of these systems. Additionally, the \n\ninteraction of the two tubes constituting the vacuum space introduces \n\nnew considerations regarding burst and collapse resistances. Among \n\nthem, one can cite (PATTILLO et al., 2003): \n\n? The lack of back up pressure on both inner and outer tubings; \n\n? The unique axial load in the separate tubes due to their \ndisplacement constraint at the weld; \n\n? The possibility of vacuum failure due to weld damage by \ncorrosion or fatigue. \n\n \n\nMechanical design of VIT systems deals with their structural \n\nintegrity and sealing capability. Nowinka et al. (2005) described an \nextensive experimental setup to assess the mechanical behavior of full-\n\nscale VIT systems. As expected, the structural integrity of the weld is \n\ncritical for the VIT\u2019s performance. According to Nowinka et al. (2005), \nif the weld fails, the VIT will lose its thermal insulation properties and \n\npressure integrity. In addition to the physical evaluation, a finite element \n\nanalysis was conducted to quantify the deformations and stresses that \n\n\n\n74 \n\n \n\nare present in a typical VIT section. A total of seven load cases were \n\nnumerically considered and twenty-two load cases were carried out in \n\nthe experiential test. The tests showed that the VIT exhibited good \n\nstructural integrity and sealability in the combined load test. There was \n\nno indication of weld failure throughout the test. The finite element \n\nanalysis results indicated that the load case involving simultaneous \n\napplication of maximum internal and external pressure proved to be the \n\nmost severe combination of loads. \n\nThus, Kim et al. (2005) and Kim and Cernocky (2005) evaluated \n\nthe welding performance and stated a set of guidelines to ensure \n\nstructural integrity, acceptable corrosion resistance properties and \n\nsealing. \n\nAzzola et al. (2007) described a thermal experimental analysis \n\nusing two connected VIT joints. Two configurations were tested: with \n\nand without an external polyurethane coupling insulator. Tests results \n\nshowed that the VIT overall heat loss is 61% lower when the coupling \n\ninsulator is employed.        \n\n \n\n2.5 VIT Assisted Wellbore Applied to APB Mitigation \n\nFeeney (1997) described several applications of VIT systems in \n\nsubsea completions to prevent hydrate formation and wax deposition. U-\n\nvalues in the magnitude of 0.095 W/m\n2\n.K are used in the completion \n\ndesigns by Shell in the Gulf of Mexico. VIT systems integrated with \n\npolyurethane coupling insulation have been used to control paraffin \n\ndeposition in the Norman wells field (PURDY and CHAYNE, 1991). \n\nSingh et al. (2005) used a value of 0.023 W/m.K as an equivalent \n\nthermal conductivity of the VIT to simulate the effect of insulation in \n\nthe wax deposition in a deviated production well using the OLGA \n\nsoftware, a commercial transient multiphase flow and thermal software, \n\nas illustrated in Figure 2.13. The computational results showed a \n\nsignificant increase in the wellhead circulating temperature while using \n\nVIT joints. Even though the wellhead circulating temperature was not \n\nhigher than the wax appearance temperature of the crude oil, the \n\nincrease in temperature with the increase in VIT length caused a \nsignificant reduction in heat transfer and wax deposition rates. \n\nFerreira et al. (2012) presented two cases where VITs were \n\nconsidered in the wellbore design phase as a means to prevent APB in \n\ndeepwater scenarios. In one of them, the VIT technique met the design \n\nrequirements and could be used as a wellbore insulator. In contrast, in \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe other case, due to noncompliance with the assumptions set in the \n\ndesign phase regarding the production string integrity, the VIT could not \n\nbe used to solve the APB problem between the 0.508-m (20-in) surface \n\nand 0.340-m (13 3/8-in) intermediate casings. Figure 2.14 shows the \n\nwellbore schematic diagram for the first case, with the possible APB \n\nproblem occurring between the 0.508-m (20-in) casing and the 0.340-m \n\n(13 3/8-in) casing due to an estimated production of 0.035 m\n3\n/s (19,000 \n\nBPD). A production through the tubing string was simulated with and \n\nwithout a 1,000 m VIT section comprising a 0.1683-m (6 5/8-in) OD \n\n0.1397-m (5 \u00bd-in) ID tubing. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.13 \u2013 Effect of the VIT on the production thermal profile of an arctic \n\ndeviated well (SINGH et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nThe buildup pressure in the \u201cC\u201d (i.e., the outermost) annulus, \n\nformed by the 20-in and the 13 3/8-in OD casings, was simulated using \n\na commercial software, Wellcat\u2122, assuming an equivalent thermal \n\nconductivity of the VIT equal to 0.074 W/m.K. The predicted APB in \n\nthe production annular as a function of the production time is illustrated \n\nin Figure 2.15. An APB difference of approximately 13.8 MPa (2,000 \n\npsi) after 1 day of production was found when nearly 1,100 m of bare \npipe was substituted by the same length of VIT. After 1 year of \n\nproduction, i.e., steady-state, the buildup pressure difference increased \n\nto nearly 17.9 MPa (2,600 psi).  \n\nIn the second case, VITs could not be used and important issues \n\nwere raised regarding the mechanical integrity performance. According \n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\nto Ferreira et al. (2012), some operational limitations were met during \n\nthe load cases computational simulation. For instance, when the tubing \n\nevacuation load criterion was applied, the tubing string collapse safety \n\nfactor was exceeded even though the APB problem between the \n\nintermediate and surface casings was solved. This case is a good \n\nexample that the use of VIT joints need to be study for each operational \n\ncondition. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.14 \u2013 Wellbore schematic assuming 1,100 m of VIT just below the \n\nwellhead (FERREIRA et al., 2012). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.15 \u2013 APB as a function of production time (FERREIRA et al., 2012). \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\nRecently, to demonstrate the benefits of VIT compared to bare \n\ntubing injector string, Karra et al. (2014) carried out a CFD study \n\naiming to provide a comparison of heat loss in both VIT and bare tubing \n\nconcentric and eccentric configurations during SAGD operations. It was \n\nassumed a k-value of 0.006 W/m.K as the VIT equivalent thermal \n\nconductivity. The computed results successfully demonstrate the \n\nbenefits of VIT over bare tubing in maintaining steam quality in the \n\nvertical section of the wellbore. Additionally, as expected, the study \n\nshows reduction in steam quality for eccentric position of the bare \n\ntubing compared to concentric position, since in the eccentric \n\narrangement the tubing can be in contact with casing. Thus, conduction \n\nalso takes place in addition to the natural convection and radiation heat \n\ntransfer in the annulus gap.   \n\nKang et al. (2015) proposed a thermal approach to deal with VIT \njoints in wellbores by using an enhanced free convection Nusselt \n\nnumber based on a combination of a horizontal and a vertical Nusselt \n\nnumbers. The authors claimed that, since the thermal resistance change \n\nsignificantly along the VIT length, there is an expressive thermal \n\ngradient along the VIT system. Thus, the axial temperature gradient \n\ncannot be neglected since it drives the convection heat transfer in the \n\nVIT annulus. Figure 2.16 shows the temperature profiles in the \n\nproduction annulus for the two studied cases: using the enhanced free \n\nconvection Nusselt number (blue line) and using a single Nusselt \n\nnumber (red line). \n\nThe results revealed that when the proposed enhanced Nusselt \n\nnumber is employed, the average temperature in annulus \u201cA\u201d (i.e., the \n\ninnermost) increases in the range of 22 to 33 K on average. Although \n\ninteresting, the proposed approach does not solve the heat exchange \n\nthrough the VIT. It is just another approach to dealing with convection \n\ninto the annulus gap. \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.16 \u2013 Effect of the annulus convection approach on the production \n\nannulus temperature profile in a wellbore with VIT (Kang et al., 2015). \n\n \n\n   \n\n2.6 Summary \n\nThis chapter reviewed the main advances in wellbore fluid flow \n\nand heat transfer modeling, focusing on APB calculation methods, along \n\nwith the most important studies on VIT applied to petroleum wells.  \n\nAccording to the literature review, it was identified four types of \n\napproaches to handle the heat transfer and multiphase flow in wellbores \n\nand, in some cases, their relationship with the APB quantification:  \n\n? the works that focus on the fluid stream, generally account for a \nrigorous method to estimate the fluid transport properties and \n\nthe fluid flow behavior, with the main objective of predicting \n\npressure and temperature distribution along the tubing string. \n\n? the works that deal with the thermal behavior in the wellbore \ntaking into account the time dependent formation thermal \n\nresistance. Here, the objective is to estimate the temperature \n\nprofile in the wellbore (tubing and annuli), in a steam injector \n\nand in oil production well. \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\n \n\n? some simulators coupled wellbore and reservoir models using \nblack oil or compositional model with the goal of predicting the \n\nbehavior of production parameters, such as flow rate, pressure, \n\ntemperature, gas oil ratio, liquid holdup both in vertical and \n\ndeviated wells. \n\n? the approaches that focus on the APB calculation. These models \ninclude an estimation of volume and temperature change in the \n\nwellbore components due to the heat transfer from the wellbore \n\nto the formation. Thus, the resulting loads are computed to \n\nobtain the deformation of the tubes from the coupling between \n\nthe pressure predictions and the structural model of tubulars. \n\nSo, the increase in pressure is reached due to the two \n\ncontributions, the fluid expansion and the annular space \n\ndeformation. \n\nIn terms of VIT modeling, it has been observed that more work is \n\nneeded to overcome the main uncertainties associated with the thermal \n\nperformance of the VIT, such as the determination of its effective \n\nthermal conductivity and the calculation of the heat lost through the \n\nconnection in comparison with the VIT\u2019s body. This can be considered \n\nthe bottom line for achieving the proposed goals of this work.  \n\nSo far, all the efforts to model a VIT assisted wellbore focused on \n\nimproving predictive approaches to heat transfer at the annulus and the \n\nuse of unique equivalent thermal conductivity for VIT, namely k-value, \n\nand in some cases two conductivities, one representing the tube body \n\nand one for the connection region. One might conclude that there is no \n\ndedicated work to model the heat transfer through the VIT in an \n\nintegrated process to the wellbore, and to investigate its effect on the \n\nwellbore thermal behavior. \n\nThus, the major contribution of this thesis is to develop an \n\nintegrated model in which the VIT system is thermally modeled and \n\ncoupled to a wellbore simulator. Then, the effect of the VIT on the \n\nwellbore thermal-structural behavior can be comprehensively studied. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n80 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\n3 MODELING \n\nIn this chapter, the theoretical approach proposed in this thesis to \n\nmodel the heat transfer through VIT joints will be presented, together \n\nwith the procedure developed to incorporate it into a wellbore simulator.  \n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, the main advantage of the two-\n\ndimensional equivalent thermal network (ETN) model is its low \n\ncomputational cost. A full three-dimensional model based on the FVM \n\nwas also implemented to better understand the heat transport through the \n\nVIT and validate the ETN model developed. \n\n \n\n3.1 VIT Geometry \n\nIn order to model the heat transfer through a VIT joint, its \n\ngeometry is divided into 5 or 4 axial sections, depending on the type of \n\nconnection thread used, API\n5\n or Premium\n\n6\n. Figure 3.1 illustrates the VIT \n\ngeometry for an API connection thread, where the five different sections \n\nare described as follows: \n\n? Section 1 \u2013 VIT body. This is the longest region in a VIT joint. \nThere is vacuum insulation in the annular gap between the \n\ntubes. This region is not in contact with the coupling; \n\n? Section 2 \u2013VIT body and coupling interface;  \n\n? Section 3 \u2013 Weld region. This is the region where the inner and \nouter tubing are welded together; \n\n? Section 4 \u2013 Outer tubing and coupling interface; \n\n? Section 5 \u2013 Coupling section. \n\n The two VIT models implemented in this study are referred to \n\naccording to the sizes (in inches) of the outer diameters of the outer and \n\ninner tubing. Thus, the 3 \u00bd ? 2 ? model has an API connection thread, \n\nand the 6 ? ? 5 \u00bd model has a Premium connection. In addition to the \n\ndimension differences between the two models, other features that must \n\nbe pointed out, namely (i) the different heat transfer surface area and \n\n                                                             \n5\n API connection \u2013 Thread usually employed in onshore, low pressure oil \n\nwells.

Due to space restrictions, the ETN model \n\ngrid for a specific VIT joint is shown in Figures A.2 and A.3, in \n\nAppendix A. The individual nodes are connected by thermal resistances, \n\nand the solution to the system of equations (one for each node) gives the \n\ntemperature distribution in the VIT. The energy balances for the VIT \n\nconsider axisymmetric steady-state conduction-radiation in a concentric \n\ncylinder system, without heat generation. Also, the following \n\nassumptions were adopted in the present validation of the VIT ETN \n\nmodel: \n\n? Constant thermophysical properties in each VIT region (all \nmetallic parts, including the weld, have the same physical \n\nproperties); \n\n? Negligible thermal contact resistances; \n\n? All surfaces in the annular enclosure are gray and diffuse; \n\n? Perfect vacuum (i.e., absence of convective heat transfer in the \ngap); \n\n? The radiation heat exchange between the VIT external surface \nand the external environment is neglected; \n\n? The ends of each tubing are considered adiabatic due to the \nsymmetry plane; \n\nAt steady state, the energy balance equation for a generic node in \n\nthe 2-D grid is given by: \n\n \n\n?          (3.1) \n\n \n\nor, in terms of the thermal resistances surrounding the node: \n\n \n           \n\n      \n \n\n           \n      \n\n \n           \n\n      \n \n\n           \n      \n\n   (3.2) \n\n \n\nwhere      is the temperature at the central node of the grid and       , \n\n      ,        and        are the temperatures at the adjacent nodes. \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\n      ,       ,        and        represent the thermal resistances to the \n\nsouth, north, west and east of the central node. A schematic \n\nrepresentation of the thermal resistance network surrounding a generic \n\ncentral node is shown in Figure 3.2. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Generic node thermal network schematics. \n\n \n\nThus, each thermal resistance is quantified according to the heat \n\ntransfer mode present in a specific region of the VIT (i.e., conduction, \n\nconvection and radiation). The energy balance equations of the ETN \n\nmodel can be found in detail in Appendix B. \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Model Implementation \n\nIn order to generate results to be validated against the 3-D FVM \n\nsimulation, the ETN model was implemented on the EES (Engineering \n\nEquation Solver) platform, which uses the Newton-Raphson method to \n\nsimultaneously solve the set of algebraic equations. \n\nThe main properties and parameters computed in the EES \n\nplatform for each section are: \n\n? the heat transfer rate; \n\n? the VIT effective overall heat transfer coefficient and equivalent \nthermal conductivity; \n\n? the outer surface temperature of the VIT. \n \n\nThe following inputs are needed: \n\n? the outer tube and inner tube radius; \n\n? the length of each VIT section; \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\n \n\n? the prescribed temperature in the bulk fluid surrounding the \nVIT; \n\n? the prescribed internal temperature; \n\n? the environment pressure; \n\n? the fluid properties outside the VIT, such as the thermal \nexpansion coefficient, thermal conductivity, viscosity and \n\ndensity; \n\n? the tubes surface emissivity; \n\n? the tubes thermal conductivity. \n \n\nTable 3.2 shows the input data used in the 2-D simulations.  \n \n\nTable 3.2 \u2013 2-D simulation input data \n\nSurrounding fluid air - \n\nSurrounding fluid \n\ntemperature \n293 K \n\nInternal temperature of the \n\nVIT \n323 - 398 K \n\nTube surface emissivity 0.60 \u2013 0.85 dimensionless \n\nThermal conductivity of the \n\nsteel tube \n60 W/m.K \n\nEnvironment pressure 101.325 kPa \n\nLength of Section 1 \n0.2962 \u2013 \n\n5.8962 \nm \n\nLength of Section 2 0.0663 m \n\nLength of Section 3 0.0039 m \n\nLength of Section 4 0.0085 m \n\nLength of Section 5 0.0100 m \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Validation using a 3-D FVM model \n\nA three-dimensional thermal model of the VIT joint was \n\nimplemented using the ANSYS 14.5.7 Workbench platform. The model \n\nassumed that heat transfer occurred in a VIT displayed horizontally, as \n\nmodeled in the 2-D ETN model. Although the aim of this exercise is to \n\nvalidate the stand alone VIT thermal model (ETN model), the 3-D FVM \n\nmodel allows understanding the heat transport throughout the VIT joint \n\nand the identification of the key points influencing the heat exchange. \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nIn the present analysis, idealized boundary conditions were taken \n\ninto account in order to validate the ETN model against the 3-D-FVM \n\nresults considering a stand-alone VIT joint displayed horizontally and \n\nsurrounding by stagnant air. Hence, prescribed temperatures of the \n\ninternal wall of the VIT,    , and bulk fluid surrounding the VIT,   , \nwere chosen. Figure 3.3 summarizes the boundary conditions employed \n\nin the present approach. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Dirichlet boundary conditions applied at the VIT internal surface \n\nand in the air surrounding the VIT. \n\n \n\nFurthermore, adiabatic surface planes were assumed at both ends \n\nof the VIT due to the symmetry plane.  \n\nThe heat transfer problem is solved through the solution of the \n\nenergy conservation equation in each finite volume. Thus, in order to \n\nbetter represent the VIT system, all sections (see Fig. 3.1) must be \n\nmodeled, including the vacuum space. The constant-property, transient \n\n3-D heat diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates for the solid parts \n\nis given by: \n\n \n\n  [\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n( \n\n  \n\n  \n*  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n(\n  \n\n  \n*  \n\n \n\n  \n( \n\n  \n\n  \n*]  \n\n  \n\n  \n   (3.3) \n\n \n\nwhere    is the thermal diffusivity of carbon steel. \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe VIT geometry was drawn in the SolidWorks 2013 software \n\nand exported to the ANSYS platform. The mesh generation was \n\nimplemented using ANSYS ICEM CFD, as shown in Figure 3.4. More \n\nattention was given to the coupling region, where the geometry is more \n\ncomplex, thus requiring a finer grid. A grid with approximately 700,000 \n\nfinite volumes was generated for a nearly 6-m long VIT. Hexahedral \n\nblock structured grids facilitate a parametric assessment of the VIT \n\nlength. The mesh was more refined close to the edges of the domain, \n\nwith a linear expansion rate of 1.2.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Computational grid for the VIT system. \n\n \n\nNatural convection was assumed on the outer surface of the VIT. \n\nThe convection coefficient,   , was estimated via the Churchill &amp; Chu \n(1975) Nusselt number correlation for a long horizontal isothermal \n\ncylinder given by: \n\n \n\n  ?? ??   \n\n{\n \n \n\n \n \n\n    \n        \n\n \n\n \n ?\n\n*  (       ? )\n \n\n  ?\n+\n\n \n  ?\n\n}\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  (3.4) \n\n \n\nwhich is valid for       \n  . The physical properties of the \n\nsurrounding fluid were assumed identical to those of atmospheric air, \n\nand based on the film temperature between the outer surface and the \n\nbulk air. \n\n\n\n88 \n\n \n\nThe radiation heat transfer in the annular gap was solved using \n\nthe Monte Carlo method, a numerical technique used to determine the \n\nview factor based on the statistical characteristics of physical processes \n\n(MIRHOSSEINI and SABOONCHI, 2011). Thus, the net radiation \n\nexchange between the inner tube and the outer tube can be calculated \n\nassuming a diffuse, gray surface behavior of the enclosure (annular \n\nspace formed by the two long concentric cylinders). A nonparticipating \n\nmedium is assumed within the enclosure. \n\nInitially, the heat transport through the VIT system is illustrated \n\nusing the temperature field obtained from a FVM simulation. Figure 3.5 \n\nshows the thermal map in a 3 \u00bd\u201d ? 2 ?\u201d VIT system submitted to an \n\ninternal prescribed temperature of 398.2 K and a tube surface emissivity \n\nof 0.7.  \n \n\n \nFigure 3.5 \u2013 3 \u00bd\u201d ? 2 3/8\u201d VIT thermal map for an internal prescribed \n\ntemperature of 398 K and emissivity of 0.7. \n\n \n\nThe VIT thermal map points to a significant influence of the 2-D \n\nheat diffusion through the VIT walls up to 1 m from the connection. \n\nFrom there, a constant temperature is observed at the external surface of \n\nthe VIT, suggesting that the axial conduction heat effect has vanished. \nTherefore, the heat transport is driven by the radiative axial heat \n\nexchange through the evacuated annulus. Figure 3.6 shows the \n\ntemperature field at the VIT external surface computed via the 3-D \n\nFVM approach, confirming that the temperature plateaus roughly 1 m \n\naway from the connection. \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.6 \u2013 External surface temperature profile for a 3 \u00bd\u201d ? 2 ?\u201d VIT (3-D \n\nFVM calculations). \n\n \n\nNext, a comparison between the ETN model and the FVM is \n\nperformed to validate the standalone nodal thermal model. Firstly, the \n\ntrade-off between different meshes is assessed in order to establish an \n\noptimum refinement at the expense of a longer computational time. \n\nTherefore, Figure 3.7 shows the effect of the mesh on the VIT\u2019s external \n\nsurface temperature. Note that a log scale is used in the abscissas to \n\nfacilitate the comparison between the curves. \n\nAs expected, a finer mesh provides a better accuracy, but also \n\nresults in a higher computational cost. However, the coarse mesh is not \n\ncapable of capturing the high thermal gradients that occur at the \n\ninterface between the connection and the VIT body. Also, the \n\nintermediate mesh does not accurately reproduce the thermal profile in \n\nthis region. Hence, the refined grid with 53 nodes fitted the FVM \n\nthermal profile without posing a large computation time penalty. A \n\nmaximum discrepancy of 1 K was observed and, therefore, this mesh \n\nwas used as a baseline for further studies.  \n\nHaving determined the best grid refinement for the ETN \n\nsimulations, the heat transfer rate per unit length was determined for \n\neach VIT section using the two approaches (ETN and FVM).

All simulations \n\nwere performed assuming a prescribed temperature of the surrounding \n\nfluid of 293.15 K. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.7 \u2013 Effect of ETN grid refinement on the 3 \u00bd\u201d ? 2 3/8\u201d VIT external \n\nsurface temperature.

The simulations were performed for a \n\nnearly 6-m long VIT. The calculation of     was based on the weighted \n\naverage of     given by: \n\n \n\n    \n? (     )\n\n \n   \n\n?   \n \n   \n\n  (3.5) \n\n \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nwhere the outer surface area of the external tube (diameter    ) was \nchosen as the reference area for all overall heat transfer coefficients. The \n\neffective thermal conductivity of the VIT,    , was quantified based on \n\n    as follows: \n \n\n    \n         (\n\n   \n   \n\n? )\n\n \n   \n\n(3.6) \n\n \n\n Although,     and     have different meanings ?  the former is \n\na performance parameter that involves an overall temperature difference \n\nand the latter is a material specific physical property ? in this case, the \n\neffective thermal conductivity is also being defined so as to quantify the \n\ncombined thermal resistance, including the one due to external \n\nconvection. This approach was adopted to be consistent with wellbore \n\nthermal flow simulators, which use     as a thermal performance \nparameter. Furthermore, it also serves as a quantity that can be directly \n\ncompared to those of other insulating materials. \n\nAs can be seen from Table 3.4 \u2013 , the larger the emissivity and \n\nthe temperature difference, the higher the values of the thermal \n\nparameter. In terms of the VIT annular gap surface emissivity, reducing \n\nthe thermal radiation resistance (by increasing the emissivity from 0.65 \n\nto 0.85) represents a loss of insulation performance of about 20%. Since \n\nthe problem was formulated considering prescribed temperatures, \n\nincreasing the VIT internal surface temperature while keeping a fixed \n\nsurrounding fluid temperature results in a higher temperature difference \n\nand, therefore, in a larger VIT effective overall heat transfer coefficient.  \n\nFor simulations with the same prescribed temperatures, the    \n\nvalues are almost constant in Sections 2, 3 and 4, while for Section 1 it \n\nincreases with the emissivity. This can be explained by the fact that \n\nSections 3 and 4 are not influenced by radiative heat transfer. Also, \n\nSection 2 is basically insensitive to changes in the tubes\u2019 emissivity. \n\nAdditionally, even though the   values are higher in Sections 2, 3 and 4, \n    is nearly unaffected by them, since those three regions comprise a \n\nsmall share of the VIT joint. This shows the great influence of Section 1 \n\non    .  \n\nThis section presented an equivalent thermal network (ETN) \n\nmodel for solving the two-dimensional heat transfer in a VIT joint. The \n\nmesh refinement was calibrated against results from the commercial \n\nsoftware ANSYS FLUENT. In order to evaluate the performance of VIT \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\n \n\njoints at conditions typical of a real well, where they are incorporated \n\ninto the tubing strings to mitigate APB, the ETN model has to be \n\nintegrated with a well simulator. The wellbore model used in this project \n\nwill be presented in the next section. \n \n\n3.3 Wellbore Multiphysics Model \n\nThis section describes the Wellbore Multiphysics (WM) model, \n\nwhich contains methods for calculating physical properties, multiphase \n\nflow, thermal and mechanical parameters of the well. The model was \n\ninitially developed by Hafemann et al. (2015) and was later improved by \n\nBarcelos et al. (2017). The VIT ETN model proposed in the previous \n\nsection was incorporated into the WM model framework to generate the \n\nmain results presented in this thesis. \n\nThe WM model considers the thermal-hydraulic effects in the \n\nproduction tubing and the thermal properties of the annulus, cement, \n\ncasing and adjacent rock formation. The fundamental hypothesis of the \n\nWM model is that, because of the difference in characteristic thermal \n\ntime scales between the well and the formation, the former can be \n\nmodeled assuming quasi steady state.  \n\nDue to the large aspect ratio of the well (length/diameter), a one-\n\ndimensional formulation is adopted for the fluid flow in the wellbore. \n\nThe linear momentum balance is written in terms of the total pressure \n\ngradient components (frictional, gravitational and accelerational) in \n\ndifferential form (Brill and Mukherjee, 1999):   \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n  \n  (\n\n  \n\n  \n*\n \n\n (\n  \n\n  \n*\n \n\n (\n  \n\n  \n*\n  \n\n  (3.7) \n\n \n\nAlthough single-phase flow may exist in the reservoir and at the bottom \n\nof the well, vapor flashing may occur as the pressure decreases towards \n\nthe wellhead and becomes lower than the saturation pressure at the local \n\ntemperature and composition. Thermodynamic equilibrium was \n\nassumed in the calculation of the vapor content in the two-phase flow. \n\nWhile several approaches are available to describe the friction \nand phase fraction behavior in multiphase flow, Hafemann et al. (2015) \n\nrelied on a flow pattern based approach by Barbosa and Hewitt (2006) to \n\nprovide more accurate predictions of pressure drop, liquid holdup and \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\nflow regime transitions. A detailed description of the multiphase flow \n\nmodel is provided in Appendix C.  \n\nThe energy balance for the flowing fluid is given by: \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\n   \n           \n\n   \n  \n\n   (3.8) \n\n \n\nwhere   is the fluid enthalpy,    is the fluid mixture velocity,   is the \nmixture mass velocity and    is the heat transfer rate per unit length, \nwhich is computed assuming a one-dimensional heat transfer in the \n\nradial direction via a thermal network model. Also,   is the inclination \nangle relative to the vertical axis. \n\nIn this model, each horizontal layer of the multistring well \n\ngeometry is modeled as an individual resistance as illustrated in Figure \n\n2.3. The heat transfer rate per unit length is defined based on the total \n\nconductance and the overall temperature difference between the \n\nhydrocarbon internal flow and the geothermal temperature profile as \n\nfollows: \n\n \n\n           (      ) (3.9) \n\n \n\nwhere the overall heat transfer coefficient,      is obtained from a global \nresistance model considering each well layer, as shown in Eq. 2.1. The \n\ntwo-phase internal forced convection heat transfer coefficient,    , was \ncalculated using the two-phase forced convection part of the Chen \n\n(1966) convective boiling correlation, that is, without the nucleate \n\nboiling contribution, but considering the two-phase flow enhancement \n\nfactor. \n\nIn order to estimate the wellbore/formation interface temperature, \n\n   , a hybrid approach based on the dimensionless time,   , has been \n\nproposed to compute  ( ) considering the models of Ramey (1962), \nHasan and Kabir (1991) and Cheng et al. (2011): \n\n \n\n ( )  \n\n{\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n      ?   (     ?  )               \n\n  ( ?  )        \n\n \n \n\n   \n[  (  \n\n \n\n \n*    (   )        ]  \n\n              \n\n  ( ?  )                   \n\n (3.10) \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe reason for adopting this approach meets the observations \n\nmade by Cheng et al. (2011) and Hasan and Kabir (1991). The former \n\npointed out that, for very short transient (      ), the correlation \nbased on the ratio between the formation and wellbore heat capacities \n\nshould not be employed since there is no significant contribution of the \n\nformation to the wellbore thermal behavior. The latter stated that, for \n\nvery short and for long transients, their approach presented an excellent \n\nagreement with the exact solution for the transient diffusion in the \n\nformation. \n\nGiven the geothermal profile and the reservoir pressure and \n\ntemperature at the PDG as boundary conditions, the pressure and \n\ntemperature of the flowing fluid are calculated assuming a known flow \n\nrate. The momentum and energy equations are integrated from the \n\nbottom hole to the wellhead. The equations were implemented on \n\nMatlab\n\u00ae\n\n and solved numerically using the Dormand-Prince method (an \n\nadaptive technique based on the Runge-Kutta method). Phase \n\nequilibrium and physical properties of the hydrocarbon mixture and the \n\nannuli fluids are calculated via the commercial software Multiflash\u2122. \n\nAt each time step, the pressure and the enthalpy, together with the \n\noverall composition of the mixture, are used to compute the local \n\nequilibrium (bubble-point) temperature and the vapor quality. \n\nIn order to calculate the APB, the mechanical model takes into \n\naccount the three contributions described in Eq. 2.20. The model \n\nconsiders the multistring approach implemented in the work of Barcelos \n\net al. (2017). Thus, each annular is treated as an integral volume (the \n\n\u201cpressure vessel approach\u201d), so that the annular pressure change caused \n\nby every local volume variation is transmitted through all annuli \n\ninstantly. This way, even though local volume deformations are \n\ncomputed, the calculated APB value is an overall parameter for each \n\nannular, updated at every time step. \n\nAs can be seen in the flowchart shown in Figure 3.8, the solution \n\nprocedure of the WM model sequentially solves the hydraulic and \n\nthermal equations, followed by the mechanical model. \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.8 \u2013 Flowchart solution of the WM model.  \n\n \n\n3.4 Coupling the ETN Model with the WM Model \n\nAfter showing that the ETN model can produce results that are \n\nconsistent with a full FVM simulation of the multi-dimensional heat \n\nconduction in a VIT, the 2-D model will be incorporated into the WM \n\nmodel to predict the influence of VIT joints on the overall thermal \n\nbehavior of the well. \n\nThe original versions of the WM model (Hafemann et al., 2015; \nBarcelos et al., 2017) treated the heat transfer as one-dimensional in the \n\nradial direction and modeled the VIT joints using a single k-value \n\n(AZZOLA et al., 2004; AZZOLA et al., 2007), which is a simplistic \nrepresentation of the heat transfer problem in the VIT. Therefore, in \n\norder to take into account the 2-D features of the ETN model and \nevaluate the overall impact of an axially dependent thermal conductance \n\nof the VIT joints, the original wellbore simulator had to be adapted.  \n\nThe following sub-sections describe the mathematical procedure \n\nneeded to couple the ETN model to the 1-D WM calculation framework \n\nadopted in the simulator. \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4.1 Adaptation of the ETN Model and Boundary Conditions \n\nWhen the ETN model is coupled to the well simulator, different \n\nboundary conditions are needed to accurately represent a real production \n\nwell scenario. Therefore, the constant temperature boundary condition at \n\nthe inner surface of the VIT (used to validate the model against the \n\nFVM simulation) was replaced by a Cauchy (convection) boundary \n\ncondition (hydrocarbon flow at a temperature    in the production \ntubing). At the outer surface, appropriate natural convection and \n\nradiation heat transfer relationships are needed, as illustrated in Figure \n\n3.9 \u2013 .  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.9 \u2013 Cauchy boundary condition for the heat transfer from/to a VIT \n\njoint. \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\nThe boundary conditions described above are applied to each \n\naxial node of the VIT inner and outer walls. At the inner surface, the \n\nconvection boundary condition is given by  \n\n \n\n   (       )    \n  \n\n  \n|\n     \n\n (3.11) \n\n \n\nwhere    is the local temperature of the flowing hydrocarbons, \n\ncalculated at each axial step as a function of the local pressure and \n\nenthalpy. At the outer surface, the following boundary condition is \n\napplied, considering natural convection and radiation in the cavity \n\nformed by the external surface of the VIT joint and the internal surface \n\nof the production casing: \n\n \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n|\n     \n\n (     )  (         )  (3.12) \n\n \n\nwhere    is a convection heat transfer coefficient and    is an equivalent \nradiation heat transfer coefficient for the annulus space defined by: \n\n \n\n   \n  (         )  (    \n\n      \n )\n\n \n\n \n \n\n(   )\n\n \n(\n\n   \n\n    \n)\n\n  (3.13) \n\n \n\nIn the ETN model, additional boundary conditions are needed to \n\ndescribe the axial heat transfer at the ends of the VIT joints located at \n\nthe top and bottom of the tubing string. It is worth to remember that the \n\nVIT joints are stacked (connected) one above the other until reaching \n\nthe depth that it is desired to reduce the radial heat transfer, commonly \n\nfrom the wellhead to the bottom of the confined annulus. For simplicity, \n\na thermal insulation boundary condition was applied to each node at \n\nthose surfaces. Thus, \n\n \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n|\n            \n\n   (3.14) \n\n \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n|\n          \n\n   (3.15) \n\n \n\n\n\n99 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 shows the two boundary conditions assumed in the \n\nmodel. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.10 \u2013 Boundary conditions at the ends of the connected VIT joints. \n\n \n\nThe steady-state heat conduction equation that describes the heat \n\ntransfer in the VIT joints is elliptic in the   and   directions. On the \nother hand, the momentum and energy equations that give the \n\nhydrocarbon pressure and enthalpy along the wellbore are parabolic in \n\n . As will be seen in the next sub-section, an iterative calculation \nprocedure has been developed to solve the 2-D ETN model within the 1-\n\nD wellbore modeling framework in order to extract, at each axial control \n\nvolume of the wellbore grid, a heat transfer rate per unit length,   , \nwhich takes into account the 2-D nature of heat flow in the VIT. In this \n\nway, two different numerical meshes can be used, namely a finer 2-D \n\nVIT grid (whose size was determined based on the comparison with the \n\nFVM simulations) and a coarser 1-D wellbore grid. This approach \n\nconsiderably reduces the computational cost involved in predicting the \n\nbehavior of the system variables (pressures, temperatures and heat flow \n\nrates) as a function of space and time. Figure 3.11 illustrates \n\nschematically the directions of the heat transfer rates, according to the \n\nproposed model, for an oil well with a VIT joint (near the mud line). \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.11 \u2013 Modeling of heat exchange in a wellbore with VIT (heat flux \u2013 \n\nblue arrows). \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Computational Implementation of the Integration Between the \nModels \n\nAn approximate method was adopted to determine the \n\ntemperatures and the heat flow at the nodes of the VIT numerical grid. \n\nAs previously presented, the physical system is represented by a nodal \n\nnetwork (see Appendix A, Figure A.2 and Figure A.3). Thus, the energy \n\nbalances were applied to obtain a system of equations for the \n\ntemperatures at each node. In the coupling of the 2-D ETN model with \n\nthe wellbore simulator, the set of the algebraic equations is solved with \n\nthe \u201cfsolve\u201d function in MATLAB\n\u00ae\n for each node of the numerical \n\ndomain using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (least squares) to deal \n\nwith the non-linearities associated with the fourth-power radiation law. \n\nA procedure for solving the VIT field temperature is detailed as follows: \n\n \n\n1. Set the VIT (finer, 2-D) mesh; \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Interpolate the input variables (                 ), from the \n\nwellbore (coarser, 1-D) grid;   \n\n3. Compute the VIT internal thermal resistances; \n4. Set the algebraic equation system as a function of the unknown \n\ntemperatures at each VIT node; \n\n5. Establish the VIT boundary conditions; \n6. Make initial guesses for all unknown temperatures; \n7. Solve simultaneously the algebraic equations system using a \n\nMatlab\n\u00ae\n solver (fsolve, Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm); \n\n8. Determine the temperature field for a specific convergence \ncriterion. \n\n \n\nGiven the temperature field in the VIT, it is possible to determine \n\nthe equivalent thermal resistance of the VIT in terms of the mesh \n\nemployed in the wellbore, calculated as follows: \n\n  \n\n      \n ?     ?   \n\n?     \n   (3.16) \n\n \n\nwhere the subscript   represents the wellbore axial grid (WM model), \nthe subscript   represents the VIT axial grid (ETN model) and   ? and   ? \nwere determined based on the weighted mean \n\n  \n\n ?    \n?  ?       \n\n?    \n   (3.17) \n\n \n\nwhere   can be the internal or the external VIT surface temperature. \nFigure 3.12 presents the relation between the two grids applied in the \n\nVIT heat transfer problem to compute the equivalent thermal resistance.  \n\nThus, the wellbore simulator uses the updated equivalent thermal \n\nresistances of the wellbore grid to calculate the heat transfer rate per unit \n\nlength and obtain the new pressure and temperature fields along the \n\nwellbore. It is important to mention that, in the first iteration, the overall \n\nheat transfer coefficient,    , at each length step is computed taking into \naccount the temperature difference between the flowing fluid and the \n\nwellbore/formation interface. Consequently,     includes all wellbore \nthermal resistances as shown in Eq. 2.1 and the heat transfer rate per \n\nunit length assumes the form of Eq. 3.9. In this case, Hasan and Kabir \n\n(1991) rewrote this equation so as to incorporate the transient approach \n\n\n\n102 \n\n \n\nby adding the relaxation parameter,   , which depends on the transient \nfunction defined in Eq. 2.6 as follows: \n\n \n\n         (      )   (3.18) \n\n \n\nwhere    is given by: \n \n\n   \n  \n\n   \n *\n\n           \n\n    (          )\n+   (3.19) \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.12 \u2013 VIT equivalent thermal resistance (for the wellbore mesh) \n\ncalculation details. \n\n \n\nWhen the VIT thermal model is incorporated into the wellbore \n\nsimulator,     must be computed differently since, for a given length \nstep of the wellbore grid, the heat transfer rate leaving the hydrocarbon \n\nstream is different from the one reaching the first annulus space (outer \n\nsurface of the VIT). This is a consequence of the two-dimensional heat \n\ntransfer taking place at the VIT joints. Thus, in other words, in order to \n\nsatisfy the energy conservation,     for this new approach considers the \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\ntemperature difference between the VIT external surface and the \n\nwellbore/formation interface. So, for a wellbore with only one annulus, \n\nEq. 2.1 is rewritten as: \n\n \n \n\n   \n \n\n   \n   (     )\n\n \n      (      ? )\n\n  \n \n\n      (      ? )\n\n    \n   (3.20) \n\n \n\nwhere the first term represents the annulus thermal resistance, the \n\nsecond term represents the casing resistance and the last one represents \n\nthe cement thermal resistance. In addition, Eq. 3.18 is rewritten as \n\nfollows \n\n \n\n         (        )   (3.21) \n\n \n\nwhere      is the VIT external surface temperature. Figure 3.13 presents \n\na flowchart of the numerical solution of the WM-ETN coupled model. \n\nInitially, the fluid flow and heat transfer in the wellbore is computed \n\nfrom the well bottom to the wellhead. An arbitrary value for the VIT \n\nthermal conductivity is employed to determine the temperature field, \n\nwhich is used as an initial guess in the second step. To this end, a new \n\ngrid, a finer one, is designed in order to capture the two-dimensional \n\nheat transfer through the VIT system. Thus, thermal resistances are \n\ncalculated for the finer grid and a new temperature field is computed. \n\nFinally, equivalent thermal resistances are determined for the wellbore \n\ngrid using Eq. 3.16.    \n\nThe convergence criterion used in the iterative solution process is \n\nsuch that the heat transfer rate into a VIT joint (through its inner wall) \n\nmust be equal to the heat transfer rate through its outer wall in order to \n\nsatisfy the conservation of energy. Thus:  \n\n \n\n?\n     \n\n    \n  \n\n        \n\n          \n ?\n\n    \n\n    \n  \n\n        \n\n          \n\n?\n    \n\n    \n  \n\n        \n\n          \n\n       (3.22) \n\n \n\nwhere      is the total length of the VIT joint and      and       are, \nrespectively, the heat transfer rate per unit length on the inner and outer \n\nwalls of the VIT (ETN model grid).  \n\nFigure 3.14 illustrates the flow of information between the parts \n\nof the integrated model (WM + 2-D ETN).

This chapter presents the results of this thesis, \n\nnamely a detailed thermal-hydraulic-mechanical assessment of both \n\nwells. The results were compared and validated against field data and \n\nnumerical results generated by a commercial software package \n\n(WellCat\nTM\n\n).    \n \n\n4.1 Description of the Cases Studied \n\n4.1.1 Description of the Case 1 \u2013 Well A \n\nThe WM model initially developed by Hafemann et al. (2015) \nand Barcelos et al. (2017) was further verified in the present thesis \n\nagainst a more extensive dataset containing other field operating \n\nconditions. In this case, a deepwater vertical 4,700-m well (well A) \n\ndrilled at an offshore location on the Brazilian coast is presented in \n\nFigure 4.1. Note that, although the present well A schematics contains a \n\nVIT column, the first simulations performed did not take them into \n\naccount. The lithological column is also shown. The present simulations \n\nstarted with a pressure boundary condition at the pressure downhole \n\ngauge (PDG) located at the depth of 3,890 m. The simulation results are \n\ncompared with the WellCat commercial software and field data. The \n\nbasic properties of the reservoir fluid are summarized in Appendix D. \n\nCase 1 considers the basic parameters presented in Table 4.1 and \n\nTable 4.2. Table 4.1 summarizes the operational data obtained from the \n\nfield and some simulation inputs. Table 4.2 shows details of the well A \n\ndesign. As shown in Figure 4.1, seven types of rocks were drilled \n\nthrough, however, only four are found above the PDG, which is the \n\nwellbore region simulated in the present study.  \n\nThe thermal behavior of the wellbore is highly affected by the \n\nadjacent formation, so it is fundamental to properly define key \n\nthermophysical properties of the formation layers impacting the \n\nwellbore. Also, the wellbore structural behavior depends on the \nmechanical properties of the formation layers. Both are summarized in \n\nTable 4.3. \n\n\n\n108 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Well A schematic. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Well A simulation / operational parameters \n\nParameter Value / Unit / Comment \n\nFlow rate 1,711 m\n3\n/d  \n\nGas-oil ratio 211 std m\n3\n/std m\n\n3\n   \n\nBasic Sediments and Water (BSW) 0.21% \n\nOil density 29.7 \no\nAPI \n\nFriction factor 1x10\n-5\n\n \n\nTubing surface emissivity 0.75 \n\nCasing surface emissivity 0.75 \n\nBottomhole pressure @ 3,890 m 31 MPa \n\nBottomhole temperature @ 3,890 m 396.8 K \n\nSeabed temperature @ 1387 m 277.1 K \n\nWater depth 1,387 m  \n\nPerforating interval 4,390 - 4,564 m  \n\nSimulating length  2,503 m \n\nLength step 10 m \n\nMultiphase flow model Barbosa and Hewitt (2006) \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnulus convection model Zhou (2013) \n\nFormation thermal model Hybrid \n\n \nTable 4.2 \u2013 Well A design details \n\nAnnulus \n\nCasing \n\nseat \n\n[m] \n\nFluid type \nTop of cement \n\n[m] \n\n10 \u00be\u201d x 6 ?\u201d      \n\n(Annular # A ) \n4166 \n\nN2 (up to 3806 m) \n\nand brine from 3806 \n\nto 4032 m \n\n4032 \n\n13 ?\u201d x 10 \u00be\u201d     \n\n(Annular # B) \n3729 Water + glycerin 3759 \n\n20\u201d \n\n(Annular # C) \n2040 Water + glycerin \n\nFirst isolation   \n\n(2050-2955) m \n\nSecond isolation \n\n(3050-3729) m \n\n \n\n \nTable 4.3 \u2013  Thermophysical and mechanical properties of the formation layers \n\nfor the well A (Eppelbaum et al., 2014) \n\nRock type \ncp \n\n[J/kg.K] \n\nk \n\n[W/m.K] \n? \n\n[kg/m\n3\n] \n\nE  \n\n[GPa] \n? \n\n[ - ] \n\nshale 2,151 1.60 2,057 17.5 0.10 \n\nMarl 1,734 1.38 1,970 37.5 0.15 \n\nSandstone 737 2.50 2,198 32.5 0.14 \n\nLimestone 887 2.19 2,540 45.0 0.3 \n\nAnhydrite 819 4.10 2,980 75.0 0.31 \n\nCementstone 844 1.96 2,644 1.5 0.35 \n\n4.1.2 Description of the Case 2 \u2013 Well B \n\nIn order to fully validate the integrated model, the results are \n\ncompared with field data from a deviated slender deepwater well located \n\nin the Campos Basin, here called well B. \n\nThe wellbore schematics shows a long, confined annulus (formed \n\nby the 13 ?\u201d and 20\u201d casings) as depicted in Figure 4.2. Due to the risk \n\nof collapsing the intermediate casing and/or bursting the surface casing, \n\nnearly one hundred 6 ?\u201d ? 5 \u00bd\u201d VIT joints have been positioned from \n\nthe wellhead (1,091 m) to a depth of 2,171 m deep to ensure the well \n\nintegrity. It is important to emphasize that this is the only offshore well \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\nin Brazil with VIT joints used to reduce APB. Basic properties of the \n\nreservoir fluid for this well are presented in Appendix E.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Well B geometric details. \n\n \n\nThe multiphase flow was solved using the Beggs and Brill (1973) \n\npressure loss correlation \u2013 for more details see Appendix F.

Later, a sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the \n\nimportance of each wellbore layer thermal resistance on the wellbore \n\nthermal behavior.  \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Hydraulic model  \n\nFigure 4.4 illustrates the simulated thermal and pressure profile \n\nalong the wellbore and the field data for the two end points of the tubing \n\nstring (i.e. at wellhead and PDG depths) after 1 day of production. The \n\nagreement is reasonable given the uncertainties involved, and the \n\nperformance of the model is compatible with that obtained from \n\nWellcat\u2122. For a production time of 1 day, the hydrocarbon pressure and \n\ntemperature at the wellhead were 16.61 MPa and 375 K, respectively. \n\nThe present model showed deviations of 0.42 MPa (2.5 %) and less than \n\n3.3 K at the wellhead depth. The deviations associated with the \n\ncommercial software were about 0.56 MPa (3.4 %) and 3.7 K. As the \n\nproduction time increased, the deviations of both simulators decreased. \n\n \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.4 \u2013 Field data and simulation results for well A for a production time \n\nof 1 day. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 shows a complete set of flowing fluid pressure and \n\ntemperature data for well A, with the hydrocarbon production kick off at \n\nthe zeroth hour on February 22\nnd\n\n, 2015. The sampling frequency of the \n\nPDG and wellhead pressure and temperature data was approximately 1 \n\nreading per hour. As can be seen in Figure 4.5, using the PDG pressure \n\nand temperature as an input, the calculated wellhead pressure and \n\ntemperature at different production times (6 hours, 1, 2, 5 and 10 days) \n\nresult in a very good agreement between the model and the field data.  \n\nAt this point, it is important to define a reference time standard \n\nfor the results presented along the text. Hence, the reference state \n\ncorresponds to a condition of zero hydrocarbon flow and thermal \n\nequilibrium between the well and the formation. At this condition, \n\nreferred to as t = 0\n\u2013\n h, the temperatures of the wellbore and of the \n\nformation are represented by the geothermal gradient. Also, once the \n\nwell kicks off, the hydrodynamic steady state is immediately achieved \n\nsince the present transient formulation only applies to the formation \n\nthermal model.  Note that this is a common approximation in the \n\nliterature (RAMEY, 1962; CHIU and THAKUR, 1991; HASAN and \nKABIR, 1994), since the time required for the hydrodynamic model to \n\nreach steady state is several orders of magnitude smaller than the \n\ncharacteristic time scale of the heat transfer in the formation. For \n\ninstance, Hasan and Kabir (1991) showed the difference in time scale \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\n \n\n(about 10\n-5\n\n) using a simple example of heat and pressure transmission in \n\na porous medium.  \n \n\n \nFigure 4.5 \u2013 Field data and simulation results for well A. \n\n \n\nAs shown in Figure 4.5, once the well is operational, the initial \n\nflow caused an increase in the mudline temperature, which approached a \n\nquasi-steady state temperature value of 375 K. Also noticeable is that \n\nthe model agreed well with the field data regardless the time scale \n\nconsidered.  \n \n\n4.2.2 Thermal model \n\nFigure 4.6, Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.88 compare the flowing \n\nhydrocarbon and annulus temperature profiles of the model and \n\ncommercial software for production time steps of 1, 5 and 10 days. Even \n\nthough the thermal behavior of all fluids (i.e. flowing fluid and annuli \n\nfluids) in both models are quite similar for higher production times (i.e. \n\n5-day production or more), some points stand out: firstly, the largest \n\ntemperature difference between the two models (2.4 K) was observed \n\nfor the hydrocarbon stream at the wellhead; secondly, the model was \nsignificantly affected by the formation thermophysical properties \n\npresenting several discontinuities in the annuli thermal profiles. With \n\nrespect to the short transient simulation (i.e. 1-day production), the \n\nsimulated temperature profile of flowing fluid agrees well with that from \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\nWellcat. However, the temperature difference between the two sets of \n\ndata increases as the well depth decrease, most likely due to the \n\nuncertainty of how the commercial code handles gas filled annular \n\nspaces \u2013 note that N2 is present in annulus A.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperatures obtained from the thermal and \n\nmultiphase flow model and Wellcat for well A for a production time of 1 day. \n\n \n\nIt can be seen in Figure 4.6, Figure 4.7 and Figure 4.8 that near \n\nthe wellhead, the annuli temperatures predicted by Wellcat decreased \n\nsharply. Figure 4.9 shows in greater detail the effect of the quick \n\ndecrease in temperature experienced by the annuli fluid, for 1 day of \n\nproduction. The reasons for this temperature drop are unknown, but may \n\nresult from a two-dimensional heat transfer model embedded into \n\nWellcat\u2122 to compute the axial heat loss from the wellbore to the sea. \n\nHowever, the phenomenon might not be evaluated properly. Even \n\nthough there are no data of annulus temperature available to strengthen \n\nthe hypothesis, a drop of about 40 K in less than 2 m distance is \n\nsomewhat questionable.  \n\n \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.7 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperatures obtained from the thermal and \n\nmultiphase flow model and Wellcat for well A for a production time of 5 days. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperatures obtained from the thermal and \n\nmultiphase flow model and Wellcat for well A for a production time of 10 days. \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Wellbore temperature behavior close to the wellhead depth for a \n\nsimulation of 1 day of production. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 illustrates the variation of  ( ) as a function of    \n(note that as the production time increases    increases as well) for \ndifferent wellbore depths, that is, for different formation layers. It is \n\nimportant to emphasize that an accurate prediction of  ( ) is \nfundamental to the model\u2019s convergence, since it is used to calculate the \n\ninterface temperature, which is an important parameter used in the code \n\niteration. \n\nFigure 4.10 shows that as    increases, the differences between \nthe curves obtained for the several formations are reduced. For values of \n\n   larger than 20, the curves collapse into a single profile that is close to \nRamey\u2019s (1962) long time asymptotic solution (RAMEY, 1962; \n\nWILLHITE, 1967; HASAN and KABIR, 1991, CHENG et al., 2011). \n\nMoreover, it shows that sandstone and cementstone are much faster in \n\nconducting heat away from the wellbore due to the higher thermal \ndiffusivity of these two formation types in relation to the others. \n\n \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.10 \u2013  ( ) and    relationship for different formation layers. \n\n  \n\n4.2.3 Effect of the production time on the wellbore thermal-hydraulic \nbehavior \n\nFigure 4.11 and Figure 4.12 show, respectively, the temperature \n\nvariation of the flowing fluid and annulus A through the well A for \n\nseveral different production times, according to the present \n\nmathematical model. For the initial flowing time, t = 0\n+\n h, the \n\ntemperature profile is not influenced by the formation thermal resistance \n\nyet. At this time, the thermal behavior is only affected by the wellbore \n\nthermal resistances, especially by the cement sheaths, as observed at \n\n1,470 and 2,040 m and by the annulus B fluid present between the two \n\ncement isolation sections (from 2,955 to 3,050 m). \n\n For a longer time scale (i.e., 10 days), the heat transport is almost \n\nat steady state. The further the radial heat flow travels into the rock \n\nformation, the larger the influence of the formation thermophysical \n\nproperties on the wellbore thermal profile and, therefore, the smaller the \n\ninfluence of the wellbore thermal resistances. In other words, as the \n\nFourier number increases, the importance of the wellbore heat capacity \n\non the wellbore thermal behavior becomes less relevant. \n\n\n\n120 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.11 \u2013 Flowing fluid temperature profile for several production time \n\nsteps. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.12 \u2013 Annulus A temperature profile for several production time steps. \n\n \n\n\n\n121 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.4 Effect of the annulus fluid type \n\nAs mentioned above, well A was completed with the production \n\nannular (Annulus A) filled with nitrogen down to a depth of 3,806 m, \n\nwhere a gas lift valve was installed (see Figure 4.1). Below this depth, \n\nthe remaining annulus space is filled with brine (water/sodium chloride, \n\n73/27 % wt). The effect of the type of fluid on the wellbore thermal \n\nbehavior, according to the present model, can be observed in Figure 4.13 \n\nand Figure 4.14. Figure 4.13 shows the temperature profile for the \n\nhydrocarbon stream for two different scenarios: production annulus \n\nfilled only with brine or with N2/brine, to reproduce the actual \n\ncompletion of well A.   \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.13 \u2013 Effect of the fluid type on the flowing fluid temperature profile. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14 shows the temperature profile for the production \n\nannulus considering it is entirely filled with brine and N2/brine for three \n\ndifferent production periods. The insulation provided by the N2 \n\ncontributed to the reduction of the production annulus wellhead \n\ntemperature, which is explained by the lower thermal conductivity of the \n\ngas. Even though the use of N2 as a packer fluid is not common in the \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\noil industry, it is justified since this well expected a gas-lift operation at \n\nlater stages. The thermal characteristics of the materials involved in this \n\nconfiguration resulted in significant reductions of the heat transport to \n\nthe outward annuli and of the wellhead temperature. While the tubing \n\nfluid temperature increases when N2 is employed (see Figure 4.13), the \n\nreverse behavior is observed in the production annulus, as can be seen in \n\nFigure 4.14. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.14 \u2013 Effect of the fluid type on the annulus A temperature profile. \n\n \n\nFor all production times, except for very short transient (i.e. t=0\n+\n \n\nday), the much higher thermal resistance associated with the N2-filled \n\nannulus results in a higher temperature of the tubing fluid at the \n\nwellhead and a lower temperature of the production annulus in \n\ncomparison with the case where brine is used as a packer fluid (Figure \n\n4.15). This behavior is due to the reduction in the radial heat loss. The \n\ntemperature difference in the production annulus reached nearly 3 K for \n\na 5-day production time frame. For very short transients, as presented in \n\nFigure 4.15, the temperature difference between the flowing fluid and \n\nthe annular fluids is very large and the heat exchange into the wellbore \n\nis characterized by an intense heat transfer rate from the tubing fluid \n\n\n\n123 \n\n \n\n \n\ntowards the formation. In this case, the flowing fluid temperature \n\ndifference at the wellhead is about 10 K higher for N2 compared to \n\nbrine. So, although N2 is a better thermal insulator than brine, at the \n\nbeginning of production, the wellhead temperature for the flowing fluid \n\nand annulus A fluids are higher in the case of N2-filled annulus due to \n\nthe higher thermal diffusivity of the gas (2 or 3 order of magnitude \n\nhigher). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.15 \u2013 Effect of the fluid type on the flowing fluid and annulus A \n\nwellhead temperature. \n\n \n\nThe nitrogen in annulus A also contributed to the reduction of the \n\nunwanted increase of the annular pressure when compared to brines due \n\nto the much larger compressibility coefficient. As mentioned above, \n\nalthough appropriate in a particular scenario involving gas-lift \n\nproduction during later stages, the use of N2 in the production annulus to \n\nreduce the heat transport to the outward annuli is not common and \n\nshould be carefully considered. This is because the gas may contain \n\ntraces of hydrogen sulfide or even carbon dioxide, which cause \n\ncorrosion of the production casing when in contact with water, and/or \n\n\n\n124 \n\n \n\nleakage through the casing threads if an inappropriate connection is \n\nemployed. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.5 Effect of the annulus convection heat transfer correlation \n\nAlthough there are many natural convection models available in \n\nthe literature, no correlation has been derived specifically for large \n\naspect ratio annuli, such as those found in petroleum wells. In order to \n\nexplore the contribution of the annulus convection to the wellbore \n\nthermal behavior, Figure 4.16, Figure 4.17 and Figure 4.18 were plotted \n\nconsidering three different instants, namely 0\n+\n, 1-day and 10-day \n\nproduction (steady-state). The results revealed that for a very short \n\nproduction time (see Figure 4.16), when the annulus thermal resistance \n\nhas a stronger effect on the wellbore thermal behavior, larger deviations \n\nbetween the annulus convection correlations are observed. The largest \n\ndeviations between any two correlations in terms of the wellhead \n\ntemperature were 2.4 K, 1.7 K and 0.7 K for the flowing fluid, annulus \n\nA and annulus B, respectively.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.16 \u2013 Effect of the annulus convection approach on the wellbore fluids \n\ntemperature profiles for very short transient (t = 0\n+\n h). \n\n\n\n125 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFor 1-day production (see Figure 4.17) the discontinuities in the \n\nannular fluid temperature profiles due to the presence of the cement \n\nsheaths are still observed, but to a lesser extent when compared to the \n\ntransitions between different formation layers.  \n \n\n \nFigure 4.17 \u2013 Effect of the annulus convection approach on the wellbore fluids \n\ntemperature profiles for short transient (1-day production). \n\n \n\nAs the production time increases, the contribution of the \n\nformation thermal resistance also increases and the convection \n\ncorrelation choice is no longer important, as shown in Figure 4.18.  \n\n \n\n\n\n126 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.18 \u2013 Effect of the annulus convection approach on the wellbore fluids \n\ntemperature profiles for steady-state (10-day production). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.6 Effect of the formation thermal model \n\nThe influence of the production time was quantified for each \n\nformation model implemented in the simulator. Figure 4.19 shows the \n\ntemperature profile for Annulus A for two different production times. \n\nFor short periods, the model developed by Cheng et al. (2011) showed \nthe largest deviation with respect to the other models. This was \n\nsomewhat expected, since for low    values the formation heat capacity \nembedded in the transient temperature function,  ( ), has little influence \non the wellbore heat transfer process. For large production times, the \n\ndifferences between the models decreases significantly, as previously \n\nreported (Nian et al., 2014).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n127 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.19 \u2013 Effect of the formation model on the annulus A temperature \n\nprofile for two different production times. \n\n \n\nAlthough the model of Hasan and Kabir (1991) predicts the \n\nlowest wellbore temperatures among all models, as shown in Figure \n\n4.19 and Figure 4.20, the deviations between the models are relatively \n\nlow \u2013 nearly 3 K for annulus B wellhead temperature. Additionally, the \n\nhybrid model implemented in this thesis eliminated the over estimation \n\nassociated with very short periods found in the Cheng et al. (2011) \n\nmodel. As mentioned in Section 3.3, the hybrid model combines the best \n\nfeatures of each model, namely the very short transient response of \n\nHasan and Kabir (1991), the better agreement for short periods of Cheng \n\net al. (2011) and the consistent behavior of the Ramey (1962) model for \nthe late production stages. \n\n \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.20 \u2013 Effect of the formation model on the wellbore fluids temperature \n\nprofiles for a 2-day production time. \n\n \n\n4.2.7 APB prediction \n\nFor the purpose of calculating the wellbore annuli increase in \n\npressure, the multistring approach proposed in the recent study of \n\nBarcelos et al. (2017) was considered. In this case, all APB calculations \n(e.g., pressure variation, annular deformation) are determined with \n\nrespect to t = 0\n\u2013\n day. Figure 4.21 shows the wellbore pressure profiles \n\nfor the 0\n+\n-day production time. In addition to the magnitude of the \n\npressure being a concern to the wellbore integrity, the pressure \n\ndifference between the inward and the outward tube is perhaps the most \n\nworrisome issue related to APB, since the loads originated from this \n\ndifference might lead to the wellbore failure (i.e. casing and/or tubing \n\nbursting or collapsing). Hence, despite the fact that the magnitude of \n\npressure in annulus C is the largest, the pressure difference between \n\nannulus A and B immediately above the TOC of annulus B is the \nhighest for this production time step (e.g. 23 MPa) and, consequently, \n\nthe most critical. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.21 \u2013 Wellbore pressure profiles for the 0\n\n+\n-day production time. \n\n \n\nThe wellbore pressure profiles for the 1, 2 and 10-day production \n\ntimes are depicted in Figure 4.22, Figure 4.23 and Figure 4.24, \n\nrespectively. The same behavior described above can be seen for longer \n\nproduction times. Hence, assuming that the collapse resistance for the 10 \n\n\u00be\u201d casing (the most critical casing) is 51.78 MPa (i.e. according to API \n\n5CT/ISO 11960), the pressure differences calculated for 1, 2 and 10-day \n\nproduction times were 30.5, 31.6 and 34.3 MPa, respectively, which are \n\nlower than the MAASP \u2013 Maximum Allowable Annular Surface \n\nPressure. Nevertheless, it is also important to evaluate the stresses on the \n\nother wellbore components, namely the 6 ?\" tubing and the 13 ?\" \n\ncasing. With respect to the tubing, the largest pressure difference took \n\nplace at the wellhead. Considering the worst case, i.e. the 10-day \n\nproduction time, the largest pressure difference was 10.89 MPa, while \n\nthe 6 ?\u201d tubing collapse resistance is 43.51 MPa. Finally, regarding the \n\n13 ?\u201d casing, the large pressure difference was 21.9 MPa, while the \n\ncollapse resistance of such casing is 24.54 MPa. \n\n \n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.22 \u2013 Wellbore pressure profiles for the 1-day production time. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.23 \u2013 Wellbore pressure profiles for the 2-day production time. \n\n\n\n131 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.24 \u2013 Wellbore pressure profiles for the 10-day production time. \n\n \n\nTable 4.7 shows the APB prediction for the three annuli for 5 production \n\ntimes.

This happens \n\nsince the multistring approach allows the pressure inside an annulus to \n\ninfluence the pressure in other annuli. For instance, for annulus A, the \n\naverage strain experienced by the 6 ?\u201d produced an extra volume that \n\nwas larger than the volume reduction due to the 10 \u00be\u201d casing \n\ndeformation. Thus, the APBT contributed positively to the global APB. \n\nConversely, for annulus B, the outward 13 ?\u201d casing, experienced lesser \n\nstrain than the inward casing, yielding a negative contribution to the \n\noverall APB. In fact, the tube strain at a given production time is defined \n\nas \n\n \n\n   \n \n \n\n     \n \n\n    \n \n\n (4.2) \n\n \n\nwhere     \n  is the external radius of the tube at a given production time, \n\nand      \n \n is the difference between     \n\n   and     \n , with     \n\n   being \n\nthe external radius of the tube at instant 0\n-\n days (initial time)  \n\nFigure 4.26, Figure 4.27 and Figure 4.27 show the tubular local \n\ndeformations along the wellbore for 0\n+\n, 1 and 10-day production times. \n\nIt should be noted that the internal and the external diameters of a given \n\ntube always experience the same elongation/shrinkage. Thus, only the \n\nexternal diameter of the tubes forming each annulus was plotted. For \n\nannulus C, the strain relative to the inner diameter of the casing was also \n\nplotted. Furthermore, the API states that the limit tube strain for steel-\n\ncomposed materials is 0.5% to ensure that the tube structural behavior is \n\nwithin the elastic limit. \n\nAs the tubes deformation is calculated locally, it is quite easy to \n\nobserve the effect of the wellbore components and changes of formation \n\nlayers on the tubing/casing diameter, as observed previously in the \n\ntemperature profiles. For very short transients (i.e. 0\n+\n-day production \n\ntime), the discontinuities observed in the strain curves are caused by the \n\nwellbore components as a consequence of changes in magnitude of the \n\nheat transfer rate. The most significant discontinuity is due to a short \n\nfluid layer (\u201cfluid ring\u201d) between two cement sections in annulus C. \n\nOther discontinuities are due to the casing shoes. \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.25 \u2013 Tube deformations for 0\n\n+\n-day production time simulation. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.26 \u2013 Tube deformations for 1-day production time simulation. \n\n \n\nAlso, qualitatively the same behavior is observed for short \n\ntransients (i.e. 1-day) and steady-state (i.e. 10-day) production times. \n\n\n\n134 \n\n \n\nThe discontinuity observed in the 13 ?\u201d casing strain curve is caused by \n\nthe fluid ring, while the discontinuities seen in the 10 \u00be\u201d strain curve are \n\ndue to the formation layer transitions. Similar to the thermal responses, \n\nat short production times, larger values of tube deformation are observed \n\nat the points of structural transition in the well, such as the depths of \n\n1,470 m and 2040 m, where the casing seats are located. As the \n\nproduction time increases, the impact of the wellbore components on the \n\ndeformation of the tubes decreases. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.27 \u2013 Tube deformation for 10-day production time simulation. \n\n  \n\nIt should be noted that the APB is undeniably accompanied by a \n\nvariation of the annulus volume, as previously explained. This volume \n\nvariation may be positive or negative depending whether the diameter of \n\nthe tubes forming that annulus has decreased or increased. The variation \n\nin the annulus volume was calculated as follows: \n\n \n\n   \n \n (\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n\n  \n  )      (4.3) \n\n \n\nwhere   \n \n is the annulus volume at a given production time in days and \n\n  \n  \n\n is the initial annulus volume, that is, the annulus volume at instant \n\n0\n-\n days.  \n\n\n\n135 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe annuli volume variations for the 5 simulated production \n\ntimes are presented in Table 4.8. Note that the initial volume of annulus \n\nA, B and C were 63.62, 44.24 and 52.80 m\n3\n, respectively. \n\n  \nTable 4.8 \u2013 Annuli volume results at various production time steps. \n\nAnnulus \n\nAnnulus volume [m\n3\n] and volume variation \n\n[%] at various production times \n\n0\n+\n d 1 d 2 d 5 d 10 d \n\nA \n63.39 63.23 63.21 63.19 63.17 \n\n-0.38 -0.61 -0.64 -0.69 -0.72 \n\nB \n44.66 44.85 44.87 44.91 44.93 \n\n0.93 1.38 1.42 1.50 1.54 \n\nC \n53.25 53.39 53.42 53.45 53.48 \n\n0.84 1.11 1.17 1.22 1.28 \n\n \n\nResults from Table 4.8 reiterates the fact that the largest pressure \n\ndifference observed in annulus B produced the highest annulus volume \n\nvariation, i.e., an increase of 1.54 % in the volume of annulus B due to \n\nthe reduction in the 10 \u00be\u201d and 13 ?\u201d casing diameters, which \n\ncontributed to alleviating the pressure increase. In other words, the \n\nresults from Table 4.7 and Table 4.8 show the importance of both fluid \n\nexpansion and tube deformation contributions on the APB prediction.    \n\n \n\n4.2.8 Mechanical model validation \n\nIn order to validate the APB results, the values calculated by the \n\nmechanical model were compared with field data.

As observed in Figure 4.28, using the \n\npressure data as an input, the calculated annulus wellhead pressure at \n\ndifferent production times (0\n+\n, 1, 2, 5 and 10 days) agreed well with the \n\nfield data.  \n\n \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.28 \u2013 Pressure data set for well A along the production time.

As the \n\nproduction time increases, the deviation decreases, reaching a value \n\naround 2% at steady state. \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\n \n\nAs a means to further validate the proposed calculation method, \n\nthe APB predictions were compared against the commercial software \n\nWellCat\u2122. Figure 4.29 and Figure 4.30 show the wellbore pressure \n\nprofiles for simulations at the following production times: 1 and 10 \n\ndays. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.29 \u2013 Wellbore fluid pressures obtained from the present model and \n\ncommercial software for the well A for 1-day production time using N2 filled \n\nannulus A. \n\n \n\nThe comparison revealed that the commercial software \n\noverestimated the pressures in the annuli, especially in annulus A. One \n\nshould notice that while the reasoning for the high-pressure difference is \n\nsomewhat unclear, such difference could be associated to how the \n\ncommercial software models gas filled annulus \u2013 note that the difference \n\nin pressure for annulus A between the simulations was over 50 MPa. In \n\nthis case, if well A had been subjected to this pressure magnitude, the 6 \n\n?\u201d tubing would have collapsed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n138 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.30 \u2013 Wellbore fluid pressures obtained from the present model and \n\ncommercial software for well A for 10-day production time using N2 filled \n\nannulus A. \n\n \n\nMore compelling evidences that the commercial software cannot \n\nhandle compressible fluids properly were provided from simulations \n\nperformed using only brine as a packer fluid (i.e., N2 is replaced with \n\nbrine). Figure 4.31 and Figure 4.32 show the pressure profiles obtained \n\nfrom both simulators for production times of 1 and 10 days. When brine \n\nentirely fills annulus A, the deviation between the models is \n\nsignificantly reduced. Also, the results showed that when a compressible \n\nfluid such as N2 is used in the production annulus, besides providing \n\nthermal insulation as observed in Section 4.2.4, it has a major effect on \n\nthe wellbore mechanical behavior. For instance, for a 1-day production \n\ntime, the wellhead pressure in annulus A changed from 27.35 MPa to \n\n71.74 MPa by replacing N2 with brine. This behavior is somewhat \n\nexpected since an almost incompressible fluid, such as brine, has a high \n\nimpact on the deformation of tubes.  \n\n \n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.31 \u2013 Wellbore fluid pressures from the present model and commercial \n\nsoftware for well A for 1-day production time using brine filled annulus A. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.32 \u2013 Wellbore fluid pressures from the present model and commercial \n\nsoftware for well A for 10-day production time using brine filled annulus A. \n\n\n\n140 \n\n \n\nFrom the results presented in this section, one concludes that the \n\nmagnitude of the pressures in the wellbore increases dramatically when \n\nbrine was employed as a packer fluid. To better quantify these \n\ndifferences, Figure 4.33 shows the wellbore pressures for both cases (N2 \n\nand brine filled annulus) considering a production time of 1 day. Even \n\nthough the N2 present in annulus A is capable of reducing the pressure \n\nthroughout the well, this reduction is much greater in the Annulus A \n\nitself, about 44.4 MPa, while in annuli B and C, this value was 19.1 and \n\n5.9 MPa, respectively. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.33 \u2013 Wellbore pressures while using N2 or brine filled annulus for the \n\n1-day production time. \n\n \n\n4.3 Analysis of Heat Transfer in a VIT Assisted Wellbore  \n\nHeat transfer in wellbores with VIT joints is singular since the \n\nthermal resistances of the insulated tubes may be larger than those of \n\nassociated with the formation. As a result, the wellbore thermal \n\nresistance plays an important role for both short transient and longer \n\nproduction times. \n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\n \n\nInitial simulations were performed considering a string with only \n\n10 VIT joints, which represents the first 100 m from the wellhead. In \n\nthis preliminary assessment, the inner and outer VIT surface temperature \n\nprofiles were analyzed, as well as the VIT equivalent thermal resistance \n\nand the radiative heat transfer coefficient in the VIT evacuated \n\nenclosure.  \n\nIn a second step, well A is modeled with 60 VIT joints aiming to \n\neliminate the risk on the wellbore integrity due to APB. Results obtained \n\nfrom the Wellcat\u2122 software were used to reinforce the validity of the \n\npresent numerical approach.  \n\n4.3.1 Wellbore with 10 VIT Joints \n\nThe results from the simulations performed for well A with 10 \n\nVIT joints are depicted in Figure 4.34 and Figure 4.35 in terms of the \n\nwellbore fluid temperatures (Figure 4.34), the flowing fluid pressure and \n\nheat transfer rate per unit length (Figure 4.35), respectively, for a 10-day \n\nproduction (almost steady-state). In these simulations, the emissivity of \n\nthe evacuated surfaces was set as 0.75.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.34 \u2013 Well A temperature profiles while using 10 VIT joints. \n\n \n\n\n\n142 \n\n \n\nIt can be seen in Figure 4.34 that the wellbore temperature \n\nprofiles are highly affected by the use of the VIT joints, as expected. \n\nSince the VIT system shows different thermal resistances depending on \n\nthe position considered in the analysis, a significant variation in the \n\ntemperature profiles was observed in the annuli as well as in the \n\nwellbore/formation interface. Thus, the amplitudes of the temperature \n\nvariations in the VIT region were of 47.2, 41.3, 39.3 and 33.5 K for \n\nannuli A, B and C and at the interface, respectively. \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 4.35 \u2013 Well A pressure and heat transfer profiles while using 10 VIT \n\njoints. \n\n \n\nAs observed in Figure 4.35, the pressure profile was not \n\nsignificantly influenced by the presence of the VIT joints - the flowing \n\nfluid wellhead pressure changed from 16.47 MPa for a bare pipe \n\nsimulation against 16.49 MPa for the VIT assisted well. Also, as shown \n\nfor the temperature profiles (Figure 4.34), the variations can also be seen \n\nin the plot of the heat transfer rate along the wellbore (see Figure 4.35). \n\nIn the regions near the connection, the heat transfer rate,   , reached \nvalues close to 379 W/m, while near the center of the VIT joints, this \n\nvalue was 156 W/m. Furthermore, it is clear the use VIT close to the \n\nwellhead significantly reduces the radial heat transfer. \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\n \n\nA close-up view of the VIT performance shows the variation of \n\n   and the radiation heat transfer coefficient of the evacuated cavity \nalong the well (Figure 4.36). For the nodes close to the weld, where the \n\ntemperature difference between the external surface of the inner tube \n\nand the internal surface of the outer tube is lower, the    was 7.2 \nW/m\n\n2\n.K, while near the center of the VIT,    was 6.0 W/m\n\n2\n.K. \n\n \nFigure 4.36 \u2013 Heat transfer behavior on the VIT joints. \n\n \n\nIt is important to realize that the heat transfer coefficients due to \n\nforced convection (in the tubing string) and natural convection (in the \n\nannular space) are affected by the presence of the VIT joints. The forced \n\nconvection coefficient is more affected by the VIT geometry variation. \n\nOn the other hand, the natural convection coefficients are affected by the \n\nchange in insulation caused by VIT, which tends to reduce the \n\ntemperatures of the surfaces in the annuli and, hence, their respective \n\nRayleigh numbers. Figure 4.37 shows the variation in the heat transfer \n\ncoefficients along the wellbore. It is possible to observe large variations \n\nin all heat transfer coefficients in the VIT assisted section of the well. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n144 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.37 \u2013 Convection heat transfer coefficients behavior along the well A. \n\n \n\nIn order to observe the insulation capability of the VIT joints, \n\nboth internal and external surfaces temperature profiles were plotted in \n\nFigure 4.38. Near the connections, the temperature difference is small \n\n(because of the small thermal resistance), and increases sharply away \n\nfrom the connection reaching a plateau 2.3 m and 1.6 m away from the \n\ncenter of the connection for the lower and upper VIT connection, \n\nrespectively. Although, the VIT joint presents a symmetry plane in the z \n\naxis, the boundary conditions as well as the numerical error lead to a \n\nnon-symmetrical thermal behavior offered by the insulated joints. \n\nHence, for the center position, the average temperature difference \n\nreached the value of 50.9 K considering the 10 VIT joints. \n\nIt has been observed from previous results that the VIT is the \n\nelement of the wellbore that affects the heat transport towards the rock \n\nformation the most. Its thermal performance is highly dependent on the \n\nemissivity of the tubes surfaces, which can be affected in a number of \n\nways (Siegel and Howell, 1992). Thus, a sensitivity analysis of the \n\nemissivity was performed in order to evaluate its effect on the wellbore \n\nthermal behavior. Figure 4.39, Figure 4.40 and Figure 4.41 show the \n\nannulus A temperature profiles along the VIT joints considering 0.65, \n\n0.75 and 0.85 emissivity for three production times of 0\n+\n, 1 and 10 days. \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n\n \n\nAs expected, the three graphs (in Figure 4.39, Figure 4.40 and Figure \n\n4.41) showed a similar behavior for the external VIT surface \n\ntemperature profile (see Figure 4.38). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.38 \u2013 VIT temperature profiles at the internal and external surfaces. \n\n \n\nClose to the connections, the temperature profiles of the annular \n\nfluid are the same regardless of the surface emissivity. In addition, it can \n\nbe seen that a large temperature difference between the 8th and the 9th \n\njoints occurred, which can be associated with the additional thermal \n\nresistance caused by the presence of the cement sheath of the 30\u201d casing \n\nresulting in a temperature drop. \n\nAs the time increases, the wellbore thermal resistances diminish \n\ntheir importance in the heat transfer process. This is noticed by \n\nobserving the smallest annular temperature drop between the 8th and the \n\n9th VIT joint temperature profile in Figure 4.40 and Figure 4.41.  \n\nTable 4.10 shows the average temperature of the external surface \n\nof the VIT joints for the 9 cases evaluated. The results show that the \n\ndifference between employing a low or a more conservative value of \nemissivity for the VIT were 1.9, 2.3 and 2.6 K for production time steps \n\nof 0+, 1 and 10 days, respectively. While these temperature changes are \n\nsomewhat small, one should consider that an inaccuracy of this \n\nmagnitude can represent a considerable uncertainty in the decision-\n\nmaking process regarding the use of VIT tubes.  \n\n\n\n146 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.39 \u2013 Annulus A temperature calculated assuming three different values \n\nof VIT cavity surface emissivity for a 0\n+\n-day production time. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.40 \u2013 Annulus A temperature calculated assuming three different values \n\nof VIT cavity surface emissivity for a 1-day production time. \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.41 \u2013 Annulus A temperature calculated assuming three different values \n\nof VIT cavity surface emissivity for a 10-day production time. \n\n  \n\n \n\nTable 4.10 \u2013 Average simulated annulus A temperature at the center position of \n\nthe VIT joint for different production time steps. \n\nEmissivity \n\nAnnulus A average temperature [K] at \n\nvarious production times \n\n0\n+\n d 1 d 10 d \n\n0.65 305.7 313.9 321.1 \n\n0.75 306.5 314.9 322.2 \n\n0.85 307.6 316.2 323.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Comparison of the integrated model with the commercial \nsoftware \n\nThe first attempt to validate the coupled model has been carried \n\nout by comparing the results from simulations performed with the \n\nproposed model and the commercial software WellCat\u2122. To this end, \n\nwell A was modeled with 60 VIT joints considering the same \n\n\n\n148 \n\n \n\nsimulation/operational parameters previously described in section 4.1.2. \n\nThe choice for this number of VIT joints is justified by the extension of \n\nannulus B, where high heat transfer rates can be found.  \n\nFigure 4.42 to Figure 4.47 show the fluid temperatures for well A \n\nusing the present model (Figure 4.42 and Figure 4.43) and the \n\ncommercial software (Figure 4.44, Figure 4.45, Figure 4.46 and Figure \n\n4.47) for two different production times. Figure 4.44 and Figure 4.45 \n\nshow the temperature profiles for a single k-value to characterize the \n\nVIT joints, i.e. 0.074 W/m.K. Figure 4.46 and Figure 4.47 show the \n\nresults for simulations assuming 2 k-values: one for the connection \n\nsection, which comprises 6% of the VIT length (i.e. the same as the \n\ncarbon steel material, 16 W/m.K), and another for the remaining length \n\nof the VIT (0.074 W/m.K), a methodology also considered in Barcelos \n\net al. (2017).   \nIt is important to mention that the value of 0.074 W/m.K is the \n\nsame used by Ferreira et al. (2012) in well B, as recommended by the \nVIT supplier as the design k-value for VIT joints to be installed in well \n\nB. Therefore, for the simulations employing the commercial software \n\nfor well A, the use of this k-value is only an approximation since there \n\nare no guidelines for the k-value for well A.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.42 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a simulation at 1-day \n\nproduction time using the present model. \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe large temperature variations predicted by the present model (which \n\nconsiders the two-dimensional nature of the heat transfer process in the \n\nVIT joints) caused the curves to overlap, as can be seen in Figure 4.42 \n\nand Figure 4.43. The same overlapping is observed in Figure 4.46 and \n\nFigure 4.47, however, here, they are caused by the two different k-\n\nvalues used to represent the VIT\u2019s thermal performance. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.43 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a simulation at 10-day \n\nproduction time using the present model. \n\n \n\nThe use of a single k-value (Figure 4.44 and Figure 4.45) yielded \n\na dramatic temperature drop in all annuli, suggesting that this approach \n\nis questionable, which somehow explains the use of artificially high k-\n\nvalues to compensate for the high annular temperature drop. Differently, \n\nthe use of two k-values reduced the average temperatures in annuli, \n\nhowever, a large temperature difference of up to 68 K close to the \n\nwellhead still remained at specific locations (with respect to annulus A \n\nfor simulation at 1-day production time). The model proposed in this \n\nwork showed that, in addition to the temperature differences being much \n\nsmaller than those given by the two k-values approach, the temperature \n\nrange is also lower. For example, the temperature difference close to the \n\nwellhead is about 31 K with respect to annulus A for the simulation at 1-\n\nday production time. \n\n\n\n150 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.44 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a simulation at 1-day \n\nproduction time with the commercial software using a single k-value for the \n\nVIT joints. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.45 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a simulation at 10-day \n\nproduction time with the commercial software using a single k-value for the \n\nVIT joints. \n\n\n\n151 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.46 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a simulation at 1-day \n\nproduction time with the commercial software using two k-values (one for the \n\nconnection and another for the VIT body) for the VIT joints. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.47 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a simulation at 10-day \n\nproduction time with the commercial software using two k-values (one for the \n\nconnection and another for the VIT body) for the VIT joints. \n\n\n\n152 \n\n \n\nTable 4.11 shows the average temperature computed for all \n\nannuli in each simulation performed at the production time steps of 1 \n\nand 10 days.  \n\n \nTable 4.11 \u2013 Summary of annuli average temperatures for simulations using the \n\npresent model and the commercial software (WellCat) for annuli A, B and C. \n\nProduction time \nAnnulus average temperature [K] \n\n1-day 10-day \n\nModel A B C A B C \n\nPresent model 371.0 361.7 321.6 375.1 367.9 330.8 \n\nWellcat            \n\n(2 k-values) \n367.6 359.8 306.0 373.0 366.9 318.6 \n\nWellcat             \n\n(1 k-value) \n366.3 358.6 303.6 371.3 365.7 314.5 \n\n \n\nAs expected, the average temperature in each annulus increased \n\nas the production time increased. The present model showed the largest \n\naverage temperatures for all simulations, which may be indicating that \n\nthe k-value used here (which was designed to be used in well B) was \n\noverestimated. Furthermore, although not ideal, the use of 2 k-values as \n\ninput parameters in the commercial software may be a good strategy to a \n\nbetter representation of the VIT system thermal resistance. \n\nIt is also important to realize that the different annuli have distinct \n\ntemperature variations depending on the wellbore depth. For instance, \n\nwhile annulus A comprises whole simulation domain, annulus C \n\ncomprises the range from 1,387 m (seabed) to the 13 ?\u201d casing TOC, \n\nwhich is located at 2,040 m of depth. Therefore, the average temperature \n\nof annulus C is much lower than that of annulus A, which is in direct \n\ncontact with the higher temperatures in the wellbore. \n\nThe effect of the thermal insulation provided by the VIT system \n\non the pressure increase was also investigated. Figure 4.49 and Figure \n\n4.49 show the annuli pressure profiles for simulations performed at 1 \n\nand 10-day production times, respectively, using the three thermal \n\napproaches.  \n\n \n\n\n\n153 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.48 \u2013 Pressure profiles in each annuli for a 1-day production time using \n\nthe three approaches. \n\n \n\nThe flowing fluid pressure profiles predicted by the three \n\ncalculation methods agreed well.

Here two points deserve attention with regard to the large \n\ndifference in the value of APB calculated from the different approaches: \n\n(i) as abovementioned, the commercial code does not handle \n\ncompressible fluids, as the N2 present in annulus A, properly, generating \n\nhigh pressures; (ii) the commercial software tends to generate \n\nconservative loads while VIT joints are employed, due to the \nuncertainties on the simplification of using the k-value concept. \n\nRegarding annulus C, the present model predicted a higher value for 1-\n\nday of production, while the pressure profiles for a 10-day production \n\ntime were similar for all approaches. The reason for this may lie in the \n\ndifference in how the approaches face the deformation of cemented \n\n\n\n154 \n\n \n\ncasings and deal with the fluid expansion behavior. It should be \n\nremembered that the average temperature in annulus C was much lower \n\nthan in other annuli, which strongly influences the fluid expansion and, \n\nconsequently, the increase in pressure.  \n \n\n \nFigure 4.49 \u2013 Pressure profiles in each annuli for a 10-day production time \n\nusing the three approaches. \n\n \n\nThe stress analysis also shows that when the commercial software \n\nis used (assuming a single or a combination of two k-values), a tube \n\ncollapse is predicted due to an excessive pressure difference on the 6 ?\u201d \n\ntubing string. In the present model, however, all loads presented much \n\nlower values than the tubular mechanical resistances.  \n\nFigure 4.50 shows the annuli pressure profiles variation results \n\nfrom simulations performed for various production times. \n\n \n\n\n\n155 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.50 \u2013 Annuli pressure profiles as a function of the production time for \n\nsimulations performed using the present model. \n\n \n\n The pressure profile in Annulus C is more affected by the \n\nproduction time, which indicates that the deformation of tubulars has a \n\nsignificant effect on the pressure increase. This is because the VIT joints \n\ncovered almost the entire depth range of annulus C, thus reducing the \n\nheat transfer toward the annuli. \n\nTable 4.12 summarizes the APB loads for each simulation \n\nperformed with the present model. \n\n  \nTable 4.12 \u2013 Summary of the APB variation as a function of the production \n\ntime for all annuli \n\nAnnulus \n\nAPB [MPa] and APBT [MPa] at various production \n\ntimes \n\n0\n+\n d 1 d 2 d 5 d 10 d \n\nA \n0.84 1.82 1.99 2.25 2.47 \n\n(0.83) (1.74) (1.90) (2.13) (2.34) \n\nB \n9.58 11.90 12.43 13.32 14.16 \n\n(3.14) (15.82) (17.81) (20.83) (23.36) \n\n\n\n156 \n\n \n\nC \n21.22 25.24 25.97 27.04 28.00 \n\n(43.77) (43.08) (43.08) (43.10) (43.16) \n\n \n\nThe results shown in Table 4.12 reinforce the hypothesis that \n\nannulus C is less affected by the annular space heating process along the \n\ntime. Even though the APB load due to fluid expansion caused by the \n\nheating was the highest among all annuli, the increase in pressure was \n\nbasically time independent, while the total APB varied significantly due \n\nto tubular deformation. \n\nFigure 4.51, Figure 4.52 and Figure 4.53 show the local \n\ndeformation for the 6 ?\u201d tubing, 10 \u00be\u201d and 13 ?\u201d casings relative to the \n\nexternal diameter considering 0\n+\n, 1 and 10 days of production time. \n\nIn essence, the local values of tube deformation in the presence of \n\nVIT joints were negative, indicating that all tubes experienced a \n\nreduction in the external diameter throughout the wellbore. As \n\nmentioned above, annulus C experienced the largest diameter variation, \n\nbut still lies within a comfortable zone with respect to the elastic limit of \n\nthe material. \n\nFurthermore, since the tube strain is computed locally, as is the \n\nheat transfer rate, for the VIT range depth, the strain varies significantly \n\nfollowing the heat transfer behavior. \n\nIt is important to notice that all tubes experienced a reduction in \n\nthe external diameter for very short production times. For a 1-day \n\nproduction, the values of strain experienced by the 6 ?\u201d tubing and 10 \n\n\u00be\u201d casing along the VIT range depth were quite the same as presented \n\nin Figure 4.52. Furthermore, since the current mechanical model \n\nneglected the fact that an evacuated gap separates the inner and the outer \n\ntubes forming the VIT, the strain behavior of the 6 ?\u201d tubing requires \n\nattention. This is because, for a bare tube, there is always a backpressure \n\nthat contributes to the pressure in each annulus at each iteration loop. \n\nFor the case of using VIT joints, the backpressure does not exist. \n\n \n\n\n\n157 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.51 \u2013 Deformation of the tubes for 0\n\n+\n-day production time.

Then, as the time increases, the \n\n\n\n159 \n\n \n\n \n\nvolume variation in annulus B significantly increased while a reverse \n\neffect occurred in annulus C. The volume in annulus A always \n\nexperienced a contraction as time increased. Considering the volume \n\nvariation in the annuli, the deformation of the tubes and the APB results, \n\nthe following remarks can be made:  \n\n? the annulus C fluid expansion was significant for a very short \nproduction time, i.e., when the wellbore is still thermally \n\nunaffected and subjected to high heat transfer rates. Thus, the \n\ninsulation provided by the VIT system dramatically reduced \n\nthe heat transfer. As a result, the APB contribution due to \n\nfluid expansion remained almost unchanged. However, the \n\noverall APB increased due to a reduction in the annulus \n\nvolume resulting from a significant deformation of the 13 ?\u201d \n\ncasing, while the 20\u201d casing internal diameter remained \n\nconstant because of the mechanical support provided by the \n\ncement. \n\n? with respect to annulus B, initially, the volume reduction was \ncaused by the 13 ?\u201d casing, which, due to the inexpressive \n\nannulus B fluid expansion and the substantial load produced \n\nby the annulus C fluid expansion against annulus B, suffered a \n\ndiameter reduction. Then, the annulus B experienced a \n\nsignificant increase in pressure due to fluid expansion, while \n\nin annuli A and C the fluids did not experience a large \n\nvariation as a function of time.    \n\nFinally, the effect of using VIT systems on the APB was assessed \n\nby performing simulations for well A with and without the insulated \n\ntubes at production times of 0\n+\n, 1 and 10 days, as can be seen in Figure \n\n4.54, Figure 4.55 and Figure 4.56. \n\nThe use of VIT joints has a direct effect on the heat transfer and \n\nthe reduction of the pressure increase in the annuli. In terms of the \n\nreduction in the global APB value, Table 4.14 summarizes the APB \n\nexpected for the three annuli at three different production time steps (0\n+\n, \n\n1 and 10-day production times) for the cases of a wellbore with and \n\nwithout VIT. \n\n  \n\n\n\n160 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.54 \u2013 Influence of VIT joints on the pressure profiles of each annulus \n\nfor a 0\n+\n-day production time. \n\n    \n\n \nFigure 4.55 \u2013 Influence of VIT joints on the pressure profiles of each annulus \n\nfor a 1-day production time. \n\n\n\n161 \n\n \n\n \n\nAs expected, using VIT joints led to a drop in the pressure \n\nincrease throughout the wellbore. Annulus C was the most affected by \n\nthe VITs, since it was almost fully assisted by them, while annulus B \n\nand C had only the upper part covered by the VIT joints. Annulus A was \n\nthe least affected since it was filled with N2, which provides a relief on \n\nthe increase in pressure due to its high compressibility. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.56 \u2013 Influence of VIT joints on the pressure profiles of each annulus \n\nfor a 10-day production time. \n\n \n\nTable 4.14 \u2013 Summary of the APB in all annuli for simulations performed for \n\n0\n+\n, 1 and 10-day production times \n\nTime \n\n[d] \nString type \n\nAPB in annulus [MPa] \n\nA B C \n\n0\n+\n \n\nWithout VIT 3.86 16.18 30.17 \n\nWith VIT 0.84 9.58 21.22 \n\n% reduction -78.2 -40.8 -29.7 \n\n1 \n\nWithout VIT 4.86 24.70 43.40 \n\nWith VIT 1.82 11.90 25.24 \n\n% reduction -62.6 -51.8 -41.8 \n\n\n\n162 \n\n \n\n10 \n\nWithout VIT 5.30 28.85 50.76 \n\nWith VIT 2.47 14.16 28.09 \n\n% reduction -53.4 -50.9 -44.7 \n\n \n\nEven though annulus A experienced the larger APB percentage \n\nreduction considering the simulations performed with and without VIT \n\njoints, in absolute pressure terms, annuli B and C showed higher APB \n\ndrops \u2013 22.67 MPa for annulus C after 10 days of production. This is \n\nbecause annulus A is filled with N2 that works well in sustaining \n\npressure due to its high compressibility. \n\n \n\n4.4 Evaluation of the Integrated Model using a Real VIT Assisted \nWell \n\nIn this section, the integrated model results are compared with \n\nfield data and with the Wellcat\u2122 software for simulations of well B, \n\nwhich is assisted by 108 VIT joints. As mentioned before, according to \n\nthe commercial supplier of the VIT joints used in this well, the single k-\n\nvalue used in Wellcat\u2122 was 0.074 W/m.K.  \n\n    \n\n4.4.1 Validation of the Integrated Model \n\nFigure 4.57 shows a complete set of flowing fluid pressure and \n\ntemperature data available for well B while oil and gas are produced in \n\nsteady-state (kick off data are not available for this well). The sampling \n\nfrequency of the PDG and wellhead pressure and temperature data was \n\napproximately 1 data point per hour. Using the PDG pressure and \n\ntemperature as an input, the calculated wellhead pressure and \n\ntemperature at 0\n+\n and 10-day production times agreed well with the field \n\ndata. At this point, it is important to realize that despite the fact that \n\nshort production time simulations were performed (i.e. 0\n+\n-day \n\nproduction time), the results were used just as an illustration for \n\ncomparison purposes.  \n\n \n\n\n\n163 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.57 \u2013 Field data and simulation results for the well B. \n\n \n\nThe simulated thermal and pressure profiles along the wellbore \n\nand the field data obtained for the two end points of the tubing string \n\n(i.e. at the wellhead and PDG depths) for the flowing fluid showed a \n\ngood agreement. For a production time of 0\n+\n day (very short transient), \n\nthe hydrocarbon pressure and temperature at the wellhead were 4.13 \n\nMPa and 328.0 K, respectively. At steady state, the simulated \n\nhydrocarbon stream pressure and temperature at the wellhead were 4.67 \n\nMPa and 356.4 K, respectively. The present model showed deviations of \n\n0.74 MPa (13.7 %) and 6.1 K at the wellhead depth. It is noteworthy that \n\nfor well B the uncertainties regarding the input parameters and the \n\nboundary conditions were larger than those for well A. Figure 4.58 \n\nshows a set of the flowing fluid and production annulus pressure data \n\navailable for the well B during the steady state production. \n\nAs observed, the calculated annulus wellhead pressure for a 10-\n\nday production time (steady state) showed a considerable deviation with \n\nrespect to the field data. According to the present model, the pressure in \n\nannulus A was 26.58 MPa after 10 days of production, while the \n\nmeasured pressure was 16.52 MPa. The deviation of about 37.9 % can \n\nbe explained by the following: (i) the mechanical model considers the \n\nVIT joint as a single tube, that is, it totally neglects the deformation of \n\nthe outer tube over the vacuum gap, instead, considers that the outer \n\ntube deforms against the flowing production fluid, resulting in lower \n\n\n\n164 \n\n \n\npressures and (ii) the uncertainties associated with the many input \n\nparameters and also boundary conditions, such as the geothermal \n\ngradient. \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 4.58 \u2013 Pressure data set for well B along the production time. \n\n \n\nIn order to compare the results generated by the present model \n\nand by the commercial software, Figure 4.59 shows the hydrocarbon \n\nstream pressure and temperature profiles for production times of 0\n+\n and \n\n10 days (present model) and 12 h, 1 day and 10 days (commercial \n\nsoftware). Due to the high computational cost associated with the \n\npresent model, only simulations for 0\n+\n and 10-day production times \n\nwere considered in this study.  \n\nAs expected, the temperature profile for the 0\n+\n-day production \n\ntime is quite different from the other simulated times. Thus, for very \n\nshort times the temperature profile is affected only by the wellbore \n\nthermal resistances and the absolute temperatures along the wellbore are \n\nsupposed to be much lower than the temperatures computed for longer \n\ntimes. The agreement between the present model and WellCat is very \n\ngood given the different time steps regarding the transient simulations. \n\nFor steady-state production (10-day production time), the thermal results \n\nagree reasonably well, showing deviations of the order of 6.5 K at the \n\nwellhead position. It is important to realize that this temperature \n\ndifference is around 4.5 K at the bottom of the VIT column, which \n\n\n\n165 \n\n \n\n \n\nmeans that in nearly 1,100 m of VIT joints the deviation between the \n\nmodels was around 2 K. \n \n\n \nFigure 4.59 \u2013 Temperature and pressure profiles for the hydrocarbon stream for \n\nsimulations performed with the present model and using the commercial \n\nsoftware for well B. \n\n \n\nThe calculated pressure profiles are also consistent for this \n\ndeviated well, although different multiphase flow models have been \n\nused, i.e., Beggs and Brill (1973) in the present model and Hagedorn \n\nand Brown (1965) in the commercial software. Deviations of the order \n\nof 0.13 MPa (2.7%) were obtained at steady state, revealing a very good \n\nagreement between the thermal-hydraulic models. \n\nTable 4.15 summarizes the average temperatures in annuli A, B \n\nand C for a 10-day production time using the present model and the \n\ncommercial software with one and two k-values. \n\n \nTable 4.15 \u2013 Summary of the average temperatures in the annuli for simulations \n\nat 10-day production time using the present model and the commercial software \n\n(WellCat)  \n\nModel \nAnnulus average temperature [K] \n\nA B C \n\nPresent model 359.6 355.2 320.3 \n\nWellcat 365.8 356.2 312.3 \n\n\n\n166 \n\n \n\n(2 k-values) \n\nWellcat \n\n(single k-value) \n363.2 355.4 307.9 \n\n \n\nDifferent from the results for well A, the average temperature in \n\nannuli A and B calculated by the present model showed the lowest \n\nvalues among the three simulations performed. Moreover, as expected, \n\nthe 2 k-values simulation showed results closer to the present model. \n\nOne should remember that, in this particular well, a single k-value of \n\n0.074 W/m.K was calibrated by the supplier of the VIT joints. This \n\nappears to be a conservative k-value, as it leads to higher average \n\ntemperature in annuli A and B. Also, the large difference between the \n\naverage temperatures in annuli A and B calculated by the commercial \n\nsoftware may be questionable since these annuli have almost the same \n\nlength. Conversely, the average temperature in annulus C predicted by \n\nthe present model was the largest among the three approaches. This is \n\ndue to the short length of annulus C, which is more influenced by the \n\nheat transfer in the region close to the seabed. \n\nIn terms of the annuli pressure response, Figure 4.64 shows the \n\npressure profiles for simulations performed for a 10-day production time \n\nusing the present model and the commercial software, respectively. For \n\nthe latter, a single k-value of 0.074 W/m.K and two k-values of 16 \n\nW/m.K for the connection section (6% of the VIT length) and 0.074 \n\nW/m.K for the VIT evacuated body section have been used. \n\nA comparison between the models shows that the pressure loads \n\ncalculated by the commercial code for annuli A and B are much larger \n\nthan those quantified by the present model. Even though the only field \n\ndata available are for annulus A, they reveal that, although the \n\nagreement of the present model is far from outstanding, it is much better \n\nthan the commercial software. As expected, the approach using two k-\n\nvalues resulted in pressure loads higher than those with the single k-\n\nvalue. In annulus C, the pressure profiles followed the average annulus \n\nC temperature results shown in Table 4.15. \n\nThe stress analysis applied to well B during hydrocarbon \n\nproduction indicated that all predicted loads were within the mechanical \n\nlimits of the tubes. However, caution must be exercised when examining \n\nthe high load difference between the present model and the commercial \n\ncode. \n\n\n\n167 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.60 \u2013 Pressure profiles in the three annuli of well B for simulations for \n\n10-day production time. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4.2 Thermal-structural study of well B \n\nInitially, the well thermal-hydraulic behavior is illustrated in \n\nFigure 4.61, which shows the heat transfer rate per unit length and the \n\nsuperficial velocities of the liquid and gas hydrocarbons.  \n\nAs can be seen in Figure 4.61, the marked changes in liquid \n\nsuperficial velocity are caused by changes in tubing string diameter at \n\nthe depths of 2,171, 3,500 and 4,000 m. With respect to the gas \n\nsuperficial velocity, the blue curve shows that up to a depth of 3,196 m, \n\nthe flow was single-phase liquid. From there, a two-phase hydrocarbon \n\nmixture was formed and, at the bottom of the VIT string, the gas \n\nvelocity increased considerably due to: (i) the reduction of the tubing \n\nstring diameter that increased the pressure gradient, and (ii) the fact that \nthe tubing string became hotter with the use of the VIT system. The \n\npressure gradient is a function of the three contributions: frictional, \n\ngravitational and accelerational. In the present system, the accelerational \n\ncontribution is mainly a localized effect related to the tubing diameter \n\nchange. The frictional is strongly influenced by the hydrocarbon mixture \n\n\n\n168 \n\n \n\nvapor content, so it becomes less important as the depth increases. The \n\ngravitational contribution also depends on the vapor content, but is also \n\ninfluenced by the well inclination. It can be observed that the pressure \n\ngradient decreased up to depth of around 3,100 m. Close to this depth \n\ntwo events take place: the beginning of the hydrocarbon mixture \n\nvaporization and the wellbore verticalization, i.e., the KOP is at 3,013 \n\nm. Hence, more gas into the tubing and higher gravitational pressure \n\ngradient contributes to the faster decrease of the absolute pressure of the \n\nflowing fluid. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.61 \u2013 Heat exchange and hydrocarbon liquid and gas superficial \n\nvelocities for a simulation at 0\n+\n-day production. \n\n \nOn the other hand, larger variations in the heat transfer rate are \n\ndue to the presence of the TOC and casing seat, that is, the interface \n\nbetween the annulus fluid and the cement in an annulus. Likewise, as \n\npreviously observed, the use of VIT joints yields a large variation (range \n\n\n\n169 \n\n \n\n \n\nfrom 2,171 m depth to the wellhead) in the heat transfer rate due to the \n\nlarge difference between the thermal resistances of the VIT evacuated \n\nbody and the connection region. Figure 4.62 shows the order of \n\nmagnitude of the various components arranged in the wellbore. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.62 \u2013 Thermal resistivity profiles of the wellbore components for a \n\nsimulation at 0\n+\n-production time. \n\n \n\nFirstly, the difference between the values of fluid and solid \n\nthermal resistivity deserve some attention. As described in Chapter 3, \n\nwhile for a single tube the thermal resistivity is a function only of the \n\ngeometry and thermal conductivity, for the annulus and flowing fluids it \n\ndepends on the heat transfer coefficient, which can depend on the local \n\ntemperature (i.e. tubing outer surface and casing inner surface \n\ntemperatures in the case of the annulus fluid).  \n\nA qualitative assessment of the components of the overall thermal \n\nconductance reveals that the natural convection thermal resistivity and \n\nthe thermal resistivity associated with the forced convection of the \nflowing fluid differ by one order of magnitude, since the heat transfer \n\ncoefficient of the flowing fluid is much higher than that of fluids in the \n\nannuli. The scales of the thermal resistivity in annuli A and B are \n\nequivalent, even though annulus A contains a water based fluid and \n\nannulus B a synthetic fluid. It should be noted that annuli B and C are \n\n\n\n170 \n\n \n\nfilled with the same base fluid. The thermal resistivity of the tubes is \n\nvirtually constant up to the VIT bottom. From there, the thermal \n\nresistivity dramatically increases by about two orders of magnitude, \n\nchanging from 0.0115 to 0.2400 m\n2\n.K/W. \n\nFigure 4.63 and Figure 4.64 show the wellbore temperature \n\nprofiles for 0\n+\n and 10-day production times, respectively.     \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.63 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a 0\n\n+\n-day production time. \n\n \n\nFor very short production times, as previously reported, the effect \n\nof the wellbore components on the temperature profiles become more \n\nevident, i.e., the annulus fluid/cement transitions at 1,802 and 4,050 m \n\ndeep, the casing seats at 1,909 and 3,543 m deep and the VIT joints \n\nbottom at 2,171 m. Figure 4.63 clearly shows that the effect of the VIT \n\njoints is much stronger than that offered by the cement sheaths in terms \n\nof temperature drop along the wellbore. \n\nAs previously discussed, the heat transfer in the wellbore is not \n\naffected by thermal resistances other than those in the wellbore until the \n\n0\n+\n time is reached. Henceforth, in the case of using VIT joints, both the \n\nwellbore and the formation play an important role in the heat transfer \n\nprocess, since the VIT thermal resistance is larger than that offered by \nformation. \n\nAfter 10 days of production the wellbore thermal behavior \n\nchanges greatly showing the relevance of the VIT presence. Basically, \n\nother wellbore components and the different formation layers have less \n\ninfluence on the wellbore temperature profiles. \n\n\n\n171 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.64 \u2013 Wellbore fluid temperature profiles for a 10-day production time. \n\n \n\nTable 4.16 summarizes the APB for simulations performed for 0\n+\n \n\nand 10-day production times with the present model. \n\nEven though the complete history of the pressure behavior over \n\nthe production time is not shown, it can be seen from Table 4.16 that \n\nannulus C was more affected by both the fluid expansion and tube \n\ndeformation. Also, while the fluid expansion contribution decreased \n\nover time, the overall APB increased revealing the strong contribution \n\nof tube deformation to APB for this case. \n  \n\nTable 4.16 \u2013 Summary of the APB for simulations for 0\n+\n and 10-day production \n\ntimes according to the present model \n\nAnnulus \nAPB [MPa] and APBT [MPa] (in brackets) \n\n0\n+\n d 10 d \n\nA \n5.67 15.67 \n\n(5.85) (16.15) \n\nB \n3.55 5.56 \n\n(9.35) (16.43) \n\nC \n17.49 22.62 \n\n(41.16) (39.02) \n\n \n\nFigure 4.65 and Figure 4.66 show the local deformation profile \n\nfor the 6 ?\u201d tubing, 10 \u00be\u201d and 13 ?\u201d casings relative to the external \n\ndiameter considering 0\n+\n and 10 days of production time. \n\n\n\n172 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.65 \u2013 Tube deformations for a 0\n\n+\n-day production time for well B. \n\n \n\nFirstly, it is important to realize that the 6 ?\u201d tubing (i.e. the \n\ntubing is formed by a combined pipe diameters, that is, 6 ?\u201d, 5 \u00bd\u201d and 4 \n\n\u00bd\u201d) yielded the discontinuities observed in the strain profile. Basically, \n\nthe local deformation of the 6 ?\u201d tubing and the 13 ?\u201d casing were \n\nnegative, indicating that these tubes experienced a reduction in the \n\nexternal diameter along the wellbore. Conversely, the 9 ?\u201d production \n\ncasing experienced a small variation in the external diameter up to the \n\n13 ?\u201d casing seat. From there, a large positive variation in the external \n\ndiameter was observed, at a section facing the open hole. One should \n\nconsider that unknown mechanical properties of the formation rock \n\nalong uncemented sections may lead to an excessive deformation that, in \n\nturn, may cause an inaccurate pressure load prediction, as observed \n\nbelow the 13 ?\u201d casing seat. Furthermore, at open hole sections the heat \n\ntransfer rate is large, once only low thermal resistances (i.e. annuli and \n\ntubes thermal resistances) are taken into account in the heat transfer \n\ncalculation. \n\n   \n\n\n\n173 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.66 \u2013 Tube deformations for a 10-day production time for well B. \n\n \n\nThe main point of attention is the deformation experienced by the \n\n9 ?\u201d, as mentioned above. As time increased, the deformation also \n\nincreased, leading to a pressurization of annulus A and C, as observed in \n\nTable 4.16.  \n\nTable 4.17 shows the volume variation for the simulations \n\nperformed using the present model for 0\n+\n and 10-day production times. \n\nNote that the initial volume of annulus A, B and C were 61.35, 89.06 \n\nand 61.94 m\n3\n, respectively. \n\n \n Table 4.17 \u2013 Summary of the annulus volume variation as a function of the \n\nproduction time for well B \n\nAnnulus \n\nAnnulus volume [m\n3\n] and volume variation  \n\n[%] at 0\n+\n and 10-day production times \n\n0\n+\n d 10 d \n\nA \n61.36 61.39 \n\n0.01 0.04 \n\nB \n89.44 89.91 \n0.38 0.85 \n\nC \n62.74 62.60 \n\n0.80 0.67 \n\n \n\n\n\n174 \n\n \n\nFinally, it is possible to observe from Table 4.17 that annulus C \n\nbehaved different from the other annuli, showing a volume reduction \n\nover time. This is because annulus C is supported by the cement behind \n\nthe 20\u201d casing. Thus, for well B, the wellbore mechanical configuration \n\nallowed the fluid in annulus B to expand, and the tubes forming annulus \n\nB forced annuli A and C, thereby increasing their absolute pressures. \n\n  \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n175 \n\n \n\n \n\n5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS \n\nThe main challenges that motivated this thesis were the heat \n\ntransfer behavior through VIT joints and the effect of the heat exchange \n\nbetween the wellbore and the formation on the wellbore integrity. The \n\nstudy was, hence, divided in two parts: the theoretical investigation of \n\nthe heat transfer through stand-alone VIT joints, and the incorporation \n\nof the resulting thermal model (the 2-D ETN model) in a multi-physics \n\nwellbore simulator. Then, the effect of VIT joints in the wellbore \n\ncompletion was parametrically assessed and further validated using field \n\ndata from two offshore wells. The numerical model was used to \n\nintegrate the different physical models for several interconnected \n\nphenomena in the wellbore showing a good agreement with both field \n\ndata and computational results from a third-party commercial software \n\npackage (WellCat\nTM\n\n). Under those circumstances, the following two \n\nsections will report the main conclusions and recommendations of the \n\npresent study. \n\n \n\n5.1 Conclusions \n\nAmong the potential solutions to preserve wellbore integrity from \n\npressure buildup in the concentric annuli, VIT systems appear as an \n\nalternative to reduce radial heat transfer from the well to the formation. \n\nBased on a detailed heat transfer analysis in VIT joints, this thesis \n\ndeveloped a thermal model to calculate the temperature distribution \n\nalong the tubing string. This thermal model was subsequently \n\nincorporated into a wellbore simulator. \n\nRegarding the stand-alone VIT joint, the following conclusions \n\ncan be drawn: \n\n? The 3-D FVM results suggested a significant influence of axial \nheat conduction through the tubing walls at regions distant up to \n\n1 m from the connection. Since these effects cannot be captured \n\nby 1-D radial heat transfer models, a 2-D ETN model was \n\nproposed as a low-computational cost alternative to a full 3-D \n\nanalysis.  \n\n? The ETN model was validated with the FVM results and then \nparametrically assessed. The results showed that the length and \n\nthe emissivity of the materials forming the annulus gap had \n\nmajor effect on the VIT insulation capability. \n\n\n\n176 \n\n \n\n? A methodology was developed to allow the quantification of the \nVIT effective thermal conductivity,    , and the VIT effective \n\noverall heat transfer coefficient,    . \n\n? Larger VIT tubing diameters (for instance the 6 ?\u201d x 5 \u00bd\u201d \nsystem) do not mean better insulation since larger systems have \n\nnarrower evacuated annulus gap, which directly influenced the \n\nheat transfer rate through the VIT. \n\n \n\nWith respect to the thermal-hydraulic model initially developed \n\nby Hafemann et al. (2015) and Barcelos et al. (2017), and further \n\nvalidated in this thesis, the main conclusions were: \n\n? Two real offshore wells were used to validate the model. For \nwell A, the model agreed well with both field data (i.e. \n\ndeviations of 2.5% and 3.3 K for the pressure and temperature \n\nof the flowing fluid at the wellhead depth, respectively) and \n\nwith the commercial code WellCat (i.e. deviations of 3.4% and \n\n3.7 K, for the same condition) for 1-day production time. \n\nRegarding well B, the pressure and temperature deviations at \n\nthe wellhead were 13.7 % and 6.1 K for the field data and 2.7 % \n\nand 6.5 K for the commercial software, for a 10-day production \n\ntime. The results can be considered a very good agreement, \n\ngiven the uncertainties of the input data. \n\n? A comprehensive investigation of well A was carried out to \nevaluate the influence of operating parameters, annulus fluid, \n\nformation types, as well as the available approaches to handle \n\nthe annulus convection and the transient heat conduction in the \n\nformation on the wellbore heat transfer. It has been shown that: \n\no The production time is of key importance to any wellbore \nthermal analysis, as the wellbore thermal resistances play \n\nan important role in the heat transmission during the early \n\nproduction stage. Therefore, the use of a modeling \n\nframework capable of handling all time scales experienced \n\nby the well during production seems like a more reliable \n\napproach to simulate the thermal diffusion from the \n\nwellbore to the formation; \n\no The larger thermal resistances in the wellbore (cement \nsheaths and annulus fluid) are still smaller than the \n\nformation thermal resistance, for the case of a well without \n\nVIT joints. Therefore, from the wellbore modeling \n\nstandpoint, during the early stages of production, any \n\n\n\n177 \n\n \n\n \n\nchange in the wellbore thermal model (e.g., the use of \n\ndifferent correlations) may cause larger changes in the \n\nwellbore thermal behavior. As the production time \n\nincreases, the formation drives the wellbore heat \n\ntransmission. Furthermore, the thermal model is more \n\naffected by the variation of the formation layer properties \n\ndue to the implementation of the Cheng et al. (2011) \n\napproach, which considers both the wellbore and formation \n\nheat capacities on the calculation of the transient \n\ndimensionless temperature. \n\no The actual well simulated in this work used nitrogen in \nannulus \u201cA\u201d in connection with a gas-lift operation which \n\nwas to be pursued during later stages of the well operation. \n\nThe thermal aspects of this configuration were explored in \n\nthe thesis, revealing a significant reduction of the heat \n\ntransfer to the outward annuli and of the wellhead \n\ntemperature. Although appropriate in a particular scenario \n\ninvolving gas-lift production during later stages, the use of \n\nN2 in the production annulus to reduce the heat transport to \n\nthe outward annuli is not common and should be looked \n\nmore carefully, as the gas may contain traces of hydrogen \n\nsulfide or even carbon dioxide which cause corrosion of \n\nthe production casing when in contact with water, and/or \n\nleakage through the casing threads if an inappropriate \n\nconnection is employed. \n\n \n\nThe mechanical model was applied to well A and the results were \n\nvalidated with field data and compared with those from a commercial \n\nsoftware. Then the above mentioned model was applied to well B. The \n\nconclusions about this study are cited as follows: \n\n? The model allowed the quantification of both contributions to \nthe APB, namely the annulus fluid expansion and the local \n\ntube deformation. This is particularly important to the \n\nidentification of factors leading to unsafe operating \n\nconditions, to the support of well design and eventually \n\nchanges in wellbore mechanical schematics. \n\n? Deviations as low as 3.71 % were observed for the entire data \nset with respect of the wellhead annulus A pressure. For short \n\nproduction times, the deviations relative to field data due to \n\nthe APB are larger. As the production time increases, the \n\n\n\n178 \n\n \n\ndeviation decreases, reaching a value around 2% at steady \n\nstate.  \n\n? Analogous to the heat transfer behavior, as the production \ntime increases, the deformation of the tubes becomes less \n\naffected by the wellbore components. \n\n? The magnitude of the pressures in the wellbore increased \ndramatically when brine was employed as a packer fluid. This \n\nbehavior reinforces the idea of using compressible fluids, like \n\nN2, to mitigate APB. \n\n? A comparison between the present model and the commercial \nsoftware WellCat revealed that the latter overestimated the \n\npressure in the annuli. Also, the high-pressure difference in \n\nannulus A could be associated to how the commercial \n\nsoftware handles compressible fluids (such as N2). \n\n? Unknown mechanical and/or thermal properties of the \nformation rock along uncemented sections may lead to an \n\nexcessive deformation that, in turn, may cause an inaccurate \n\npressure load prediction. \n\n \n\nIn order to demonstrate the effect of VIT joints on the wellbore \n\nthermal-structural behavior, two synthetic case studies were carried out \n\nusing 10 and 60 insulated joints, respectively. The main findings are as \n\nfollows: \n\n? Significant temperature variations were observed in the annuli \nand wellbore/formation interface. These temperature \n\noscillations were driven by the changes in the local VIT thermal \n\nresistance, which is the dominating thermal resistance in the \n\nphysical domain. \n\n? A sensitivity study on the value of the surface emissivity in the \nevacuated gap showed that, even for the case with only 10 VIT \n\njoints, the average annuli temperature difference were as large \n\nas 2.6 K. \n\n? A comparison of the present model with the commercial \nsoftware using a single k-value or a combination of two k-\n\nvalues showed that the present model showed the largest \naverage temperatures for all simulations, which indicates that \n\nsuch k-values were poorly designed for well A. Also, another \n\nkey point is that when 2 k-values are used as input parameters \n\nin the commercial software, although not ideal, it may be a \n\n\n\n179 \n\n \n\n \n\ngood strategy for a better representation of the VIT system \n\nthermal resistance. \n\n? A stress analysis of the well assisted by 60 VIT joints (i.e. the \nartificial case study) showed that using the commercial software \n\nfor both approaches (assuming a single k-value or two k-\n\nvalues), the load due to the pressure difference over the 6 5/8\u201d \n\ntubing string would lead to collapse, while for the present \n\nmodel all loads presented much lower values than the tubular \n\nmechanical resistances. The large load difference is due, in part, \n\nto the different manners in which the models handle the gas \n\nfilled annulus A. \n\n? As the strain is computed locally, and since the heat transfer \nvaries significantly along the VIT length, the strain also varies \n\nsignificantly, since it is thermally dependent. \n\n \n\nRegarding the performance of the integrated model in predicting \n\nthe behavior of well B, the following conclusions can be drawn:  \n\n? Even though a considerable deviation with respect to field data \nfor the pressure increase in annulus A at steady state was \n\nobserved (37.9%), the present model showed a much better \n\nagreement than the best version (single k-value) of the \n\ncommercial software (deviation of nearly 165%). This large \n\ndeviation can be explained by the two following points: (i) the \n\ndeformation of the outer tubing of the VIT is neglected in the \n\nmechanical model, and (ii) the many uncertainties related to the \n\ninput parameters and boundary conditions, such as the \n\ngeothermal gradient. \n\n? The average temperature in annuli A and B calculated by the \npresent model showed the lowest values among the three \n\nassessed approaches. Moreover, as expected, the two k-value \n\nsimulation showed results closer to those of the present model. \n\nA single k-value of 0.074 W/m.K was set by the VIT \n\ncommercial supplier specifically for well B. This conservative \n\nk-value was employed leading to a higher annuli A and B \n\naverage temperatures.  \n\n? The stress analysis pointed out that all predicted loads were \nwithin the tubes mechanical limits. However, caution must be \n\nexercised when examining the high load difference between the \n\npresent model and the commercial code.  \n\n \n\n\n\n180 \n\n \n\n5.2 Future Research Needs  \n\nAlthough two actual wells were used to evaluate the models \n\ndeveloped in this thesis, more work is needed to confirm the robustness \n\nof the integrated model and to gain more confidence in the results. \n\nConsidering the progress made in this work, the following \n\nrecommendations for future research can be listed: \n\n? Development of a two-dimensional formation heat diffusion \nmodel to estimate the heat transport between the rock formation \n\nand the seabed to show the heat loss to the sea; \n\n? Development of a structural model to take into account the \ndeformation of the VIT outer tubing over the inner tubing due \n\nto the pressure increase in the production annulus. This may \n\ncause the deformation of the inner tubing that was neglected in \n\nthis work. \n\n? Using parallel computation to reduce the computational cost for \nperforming the VIT simulations. \n\n? A comprehensive study about the effect of fluid and formation \nproperties uncertainties on the APB is needed to improve the \n\nreliability of the mathematical models. \n\n? Carry out experiments in standalone VIT joints (under \nlaboratory conditions) to validate the thermal models presented \n\nin this thesis. \n\n  \n\n\n\n181 \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n[1] ALCOFRA, E.

Such thermal circuits represent half VIT joint since \n\nsymmetry planes are applied, so boundary conditions at each end are \n\ninsulated. Each heat transfer mode embedded into the network is \n\nrepresented by thermal resistances in the radial and/or axial directions, \n\nand so connecting the nodal points. Hence, the thermal networks have \n\nbeen built to represent the VIT components: inner and outer tubes, weld, \n\nconnection and the evacuated cavity. \n\nFigure A.1 depicts the legend used in both VIT thermal networks. \n\nSuch legend takes into account the nomenclatures which have been used \n\nto define temperatures represented by the nodes, the heat transfer mode \n\nand the heat flow direction, as well as some VIT geometric \n\ncharacteristics. \n\n \nThermal resistance [place, region (1~5) or \n\ninterface (12, 23, 34, 45, 5F), heat transfer \n\nmode, specification] \n\nHeat transfer mode: \n\nCR \u2013 radial conduction \n\nCA \u2013 axial conduction \n\nConv \u2013 convection \n\nTemperature [place, region/interface, \n\nspecification] \n\nRad - radiation \n\n   \n\nSpecification:  Place: \n\nm \u2013 mean vertical  int \u2013 internal tube \n\nyi \u2013 lower  ext \u2013 external tube \n\nys \u2013 upper  vac - vacuum \n\nd \u2013 right side  con \u2013 connection \n\ne \u2013 left side  sol - weld \n\nFluido \u2013 fluid  F \u2013 VIT extremity \n\n  - Surrounding environment  i - internal \n\n e - external \n\nFigure A.1 \u2013 Nomenclature for the VIT thermal network. \n\n \n\n\n\n200 \n\n \n \n\n \nFigure A.2 \u2013 VIT 3 \u00bd\u201d x 2 ?\u201d equivalent thermal circuit. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n201 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure A.3 \u2013 VIT 6 ?\" x 5 \u00bd\u201d equivalent thermal circuit. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n202 \n\n \n\nAPPENDIX B \n\nThis appendix describes in detail the equations obtained from the \n\nVIT nodal network illustrated in Appendix A forming the system of \n\nequations. At steady state, the basic equation to represent the energy \n\nbalance for the VIT cylindrical coordinates axisymmetric system on a \n\nunit area basis for a generic node into the VIT thermal network, in terms \n\nof temperature and thermal resistances is of the form  \n\n \n           \n\n      \n \n\n           \n\n      \n \n\n           \n\n      \n \n\n           \n\n      \n   B.1 \n\n \n\nwhere a node is defined by the (   ) combination into the VIT mesh,      \n\nis the central node, and       ,       ,        and        are the \ntemperatures at the adjacent nodes. The thermal resistances between \n\nadjacent nodes and the central node are given by       ,       ,        \n\nand       .  \n\nThe present appendix was organized in order to first present the \n\nbasic thermal resistances equations as a function of the reference heat \n\nexchange area, which in turn, is calculated as a function of the external \n\ndiameter of the VIT outer tube. It is worthwhile mentioning that the \n\nthermal resistance (resistivity) is calculated here in (    )  ? . Then, \nall representative energy balance equations are quantified for each \n\nlocation into the VIT network.  \n\nThe thermal resistances for all heat transfer modes involved in the \n\nthermal circuit are shown in the following sub-sections. \n\n \n\nB.1 CONDUCTION \n\nRadial conduction resistance between two adjacent nodes \n\ndisplayed at the same axial position   is calculated as a function of the \ngeometry at that position and of the thermal conductivity as follows \n\n \n\n    \n   \n  \n\n   (\n      \n      \n\n) B.2 \n\n \n\n\n\n203 \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere     is the heat exchange reference radius,    is the thermal \nconductivity of the carbon-steel tubing and        and        are, \n\nrespectively, the outer and inner radii. \n\nWith respect to the axial conduction between two adjacent nodes \n\ndisplayed at the same position  , the thermal resistance is calculated \naccording to the following equation  \n\n \n\n    \n      \n  \n\n B.3 \n\n \n\nwhere        is the axial length between the two adjacent nodes. It \nshould be noted that this resistance is influenced by the VIT mesh size. \n\n \n\nB.2 CONVECTION \n\nConvection heat transfer is applied at the VIT boundaries, while \n\nthe VIT inner and outer surface walls are in contact with fluid. In the \n\ncase of the internal VIT surface wall, which is in contact with the \n\nflowing fluid, a forced convection is taking place. For this situation, the \n\nforced convection thermal resistance is given by  \n\n \n\n      \n   \n      \n\n \n \n\n   \n B.4 \n\n \n\nwhere        is the radius related to the VIT inner wall. Thus,   can be the \nposition 1 or 5 depending on the axial position. The forced convection \n\nheat transfer coefficient,    , may be calculated using Chen\u2019s correlation \n(1963) as follows   \n\n \n\n         *\n (   ) \n\n  \n+\n\n   \n\n[\n     \n\n  \n]\n   \n\n(\n  \n \n\n*   B.5  \n\n \n\nwhere   is a flow parameter defined by the ratio of the two-phase \nReynolds number to the liquid Reynolds number, based on the liquid \nhold-up. Although this approach was developed based on convective \n\nboiling data, the heat transfer is computed as a function of two different \n\ncontributions: a convective and a nucleate boiling. Here, just the first \n\n\n\n204 \n\n \n\ncontribution has been considered.   is calculate as a function of the \nMartinelli\u2019s parameter as follows \n\n \n\n  {\n  \n\n     (         \n  )     \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n      \n\n     B.6  \n\n \n\nwhere the Martinelli\u2019s parameter is defined as   \n\n \n\n    (\n   \n\n \n*\n   \n\n(\n  \n\n  \n*\n   \n\n(\n  \n  \n\n)\n\n   \n\n     B.7  \n\n \n\nRegarding to the VIT outer wall, the system is in contact with the \n\nannular cavity stagnant fluid. Under these circumstances, natural \n\nconvection heat transfer takes place and for this reason, the convection \n\nthermal resistance may be calculated in this manner \n\n \n\n          \n   \n\n      \n \n \n\n  \n B.8  \n\n \n\nwhere        is the radius related to the VIT outer wall. Thus,   can be \n\nthe position 7 or 9 depending on the axial position. The natural \n\nconvection heat transfer coefficient,   , may be calculated considering \nthe correlation for annulus gap provided by Hasan and Kabir (1994) \n\nbased on the hydraulic diameter,   , as follows \n   \n\n   \n    (\n\n        \n      ? )\n\n    \n      \n\n  \n         (               )\n\n   \n   B.9  \n\n \n\nwhere          is the casing internal radius,     is the annulus fluid \nthermal conductivity,    is the Rayleigh number for the annulus gap, \ncalculated using the annulus fluid properties as follows \n\n \n\n   \n    \n\n    \n (               )\n\n \n (               )\n\n     \n B.10  \n\n \n\nand the hydraulic diameter is defined as  \n\n \n\n\n\n205 \n\n \n\n \n\n     (               ) . B.11  \n\n \n\nB.3 RADIATION \n\nRadiative heat transfer takes place at the VIT\u2019s evacuated cavity, \n\nas well as between the inner casing wall and the VIT outer surface \n\nforming the production annular space. In both cases the radiative \n\nthermal resistance is defined as \n\n \n\n     \n   \n\n      \n \n \n\n  \n B.12  \n\n \n\nwhere        may be the external radius of the inner tubing forming the \n\nVIT cavity or the external radius of the VIT outer tubing forming the \n\nproduction annulus, depending on the situation, and    is the radiation \nheat transfer coefficient which is calculated considering that in both \n\ncases the cavity is formed by long concentric cylinders \n\n \n\n   \n  (             )  (      \n\n        \n )\n\n \n\n \n \n\n(   )\n\n \n(\n\n      \n\n      \n*\n\n    B.13  \n\n \n\nwhere   is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,   is the emissivity of the \nsurfaces forming the cavity, i.e., is the same for all surfaces, and         \n\nand        are the temperature at the internal cavity surface and external \n\ncavity surface, respectively.        and        are the radii of the internal \n\nand external surface of the cavity. It should be noted that         is \n\nsimilar to       , that is in turn similar to       in the case of the \n\nradiation exchange between the annulus production surfaces. With \n\nrespect to the VIT cavity,        is the internal radius of the outer VIT \n\ntube. \n\n \n\nB.4 ENERGY BALANCE - SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS \n\nAs abovementioned, the energy balance equations were \n\ndeveloped in terms of the temperature difference between the \n\ntemperature at the node and the adjacent nodes and the thermal \n\n\n\n206 \n\n \n\nresistances as shown in Eq. B.1. According to Figures A.2 and A.3, \n\nthere are a maximum of 9 nodes displayed along the VIT radial \n\ndirection. Hence, in this case 9 energy balance equations are required, \n\nwith the first and the ninth equations depending, respectively, on the \n\nfluid temperature due to the forced convection in the tubing and the \n\ncasing inner surface temperature due to the natural convection and \n\nradiation in the annulus gap. Some examples on how the energy balance \n\nequations have been developed are shown in the following \n\ndocumentation.  \n\nBy convention, the adopted direction of the heat flow is upward \n\nand from the center to out of the VIT, flowing radially, in the latter case. \n\nAs the equations are quite similar along the VIT axial direction, \n\nrespecting the geometry aspects, only three examples are presented, in \n\nother words, the energy balance equations applied at nodes located in \n\nthree different positions along the   direction.  \n \n\nB.4.1 Lower extremity of the VIT joint \n\nAt this location the boundary condition of adiabatic wall is \n\napplied thus, no heat exchange takes place between the lower extremity \n\nof the VIT and the last tubing arranged before the VIT joints.  \n\nFigure B.4 shows the equivalent thermal circuit used to develop \n\nthe system of equations for the present location.

(1967) \n\ncorrelation for void fraction are probably sufficiently accurate to \n\ncalculate the total pressure gradient. In this region the frictional \n\ncomponent is usually much smaller than the gravitational one. \n\nThus, the friction factor is obtained as a function of the Reynolds \n\nnumber considering the flow mixture as a liquid,     , through the \nequation suggested by Friedel (1979): \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n226 \n\n \n\n  \n\n{\n \n \n\n \n \n\n      ?          \n      \n\n(     )\n   \n\n                         \n\n            \n \n\n \n\n                          \n\n            \n \n\n \n\n           \n\n C.2  \n\n \n\nWith respect to the gravitational pressure drop calculated as a \n\nfunction of the void fraction from Zuber (1967) is given by \n\n \n\n  \n   \n\n        \n     C.3  \n\n \n\nwhere,     corresponds to the drift flux velocity and is obtained from \n\n(Zuber, 1967); Collier e Thome, 1994) as \n\n \n\n        (   ) (   \n     \n\n   \n*\n\n \n\n \n     C.4  \n\n \n\nC.3 THE BUBBLE TO SLUG REGIME TRANSITION \n\nThe transition from bubble flow to slug flow has been \n\nsuccessfully predicted by a simple criterion which dictates that the \n\ntransition to slug flow takes place when the average void fraction \n\nreaches a critical value of around 0.25 (Taitel et al., 1980; Mishima and \n\nIshii, 1984; Pauchon and Banerjee, 1986).  \n\n \n\nC.4 THE SLUG FLOW REGIME \n\nFor the slug flow region, it was selected the model of de Cachard \n\nand Delhaye (1996). This is a simple and yet comprehensive model, \n\nwhich captures some of the important aspects of the slug flow regime \n\nsuch as the opposite directions of wall shear in both slug and Taylor \n\nbubble regions.  \n\nIn this model, steady and fully developed slug flow is described \n\nas a succession of identical unit cells. A unit cell consists of a cylindrical \n\n\n\n227 \n\n \n\n \n\nTaylor bubble surrounded by a falling liquid film and of a liquid slug, as \n\nillustrated in Figure C.1. \n\n \nFigure C. 1 \u2013 Unit cell of slug regime (Hafemann, 2015). \n\n  \n\nA very complex feature of slug flow is the understanding and \n\nprediction of the mechanisms by which gas becomes entrained in the \n\nform of small bubbles in the liquid slug. A criterion for the existence of \n\nnon-aerated slugs is written in terms of the Bond number as follows: \n\n \n\n   \n(     )   \n\n  \n         C.5  \n\n \n\nIn most simulations reported here, values of Bond number are of \n\nthe order of 1,300 and, therefore, gas entrainment within the slug cannot \n\nbe disregarded. In the original paper of de Cachard and Delhaye (1996) \n\ngas entrainment in the slug was neglected since 140Bo ?  in their \nstudies. In what follows, an extension of the de Cachard and Delhaye \n\nmodel taking into account slug entrainment is presented. \n\nThe fraction of the unit cell transit time corresponding to the \n\nTaylor bubble is: \n \n\n  \n  \n\n     \n     C.6  \n\n \n\n\n\n228 \n\n \n\nThe integration of the instantaneous continuity equations for the \n\ngas, liquid and the mixture produces the following equations for the \n\nregion of Taylor bubble and the liquid slug when relating to the mixture \n\nsuperficial velocity,     as follows \n \n\n          (    )       C.7  \n \n\n          (    )        C.8  \n \n\nThe unit slug flow model is complemented with closure \n\nexpressions for the Taylor bubble velocity,      , the falling film \n\nvelocity,     , and the slug void fraction,   . The following \napproximations were made: (i) the flow in the liquid film is fully \n\ndeveloped, (ii) the flow in the slug is fully developed and (iii) there is no \n\nslip between the gas and the liquid in the liquid slug, i.e.,          . \n\nFor the Taylor bubble velocity, the Nicklin et al. (1962) \n\nexpression is used: \n\n \n\n                 C.9  \n \n\nThe coefficient 1.2 in the above equation is the turbulent flow \n\nvelocity profile coefficient in the liquid slug.    is the rise velocity of a \nTaylor bubble in quiescent liquid.

The proposed \n\ncorrelation is given by  \n \n\n   \n      (\n\n    \n\n    \n)\n      \n\n           \n\n  \n   \n\nG. 5 \n\n\n\n251 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nG.2 EVALUATION OF THE FORMATION MODEL \n\nApplying a radial energy balance on the formation leads to the \n\nfollowing one-dimensional transient governing equation of energy \n\nconservation in cylindrical coordinates \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n  \n \n\n     \n\n   \n \n\n \n\n   \n\n    \n\n  \n   G. 6 \n\n \n\nwhere     and     are the formation temperature and thermal diffusivity, \n\nrespectively. Given the appropriate boundary conditions, Eq. (G. 6) can \n\nbe solved using Laplace Transforms or other analytical methods. When \n\ncoupled with the heat transmission inside the wellbore, and considering \n\na constant heat transfer rate from the wellbore to the formation, the \n\ntemperature of the interface between the wellbore and the formation can \n\nbe written as (Hasan and Kabir, 1991) \n\n  \n\n    \n               ( )  \n\n          ( )\n     G. 7 \n\n \n\nwhere  ( ) is the transient dimensionless temperature. In this thesis \nseveral formation models are compared in order to estimate the  ( ) \ntransient function. \n\n \n\nG.2.1 Ramey (1962) \n\nThe first key work to provide a solution for     used the Carslaw \n\nand Jaeger solution (1959) for an infinitely long cylinder with a constant \n\nwall heat flux (Ramey, 1962). In this work, a transient dimensionless \n\ntemperature for long times (more than 7 days) is defined as \n\n \n\n ( )    ( ?  )           G. 8 \n\n \n\nwhere    is the dimensionless time function, which represents the \ntransient diffusion time as follows \n\n\n\n252 \n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n     \n\n   \n   G. 9 \n\n \n\nG.2.2 Hasan &amp; Kabir (1991) \n\nUsing the principle of superposition, Hasan and Kabir (1991) \n\nprovided an analytical solution for  ( ). The results were plotted and \nfitted to yield two new  ( ) functions depending on the production time \n\n \n\n ( )\n\n {\n      ?   (     ?  )           \n\n[            (  )]  *  \n   \n\n  \n? +           \n\n \nG.10 \n\n \n\nG.2.3 Chiu and Thakur (1991) \n\nBased on the exact solution of Carslaw and Jaeger (1959) for \n\n ( ), Chiu and Thakur (1991) derived a new correlation expression \nvalid for all times, \n\n \n\n ( )         (        )  G.11 \n\n \n\nG.2.4 Cheng et al. (2011) \n\nCheng et al. (2011) developed a new correlation for  ( ) that \ntakes into account the wellbore heat capacity, \n\n \n\n ( )    ( ?  )        \n\n \n \n\n   \n[  (  \n\n \n\n \n*    (   )        ]   \n\nG.12 \n\n \n\nwhere   is the ratio of the formation heat capacity and the wellbore heat \ncapacity: \n\n \n\n\n\n253 \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n(   )  \n\n(   )  \n\n  G.13 \n\n \n\nwhere   is the density and    is the specific heat capacity. \nIn this thesis, a hybrid approach has been proposed to estimate \n\n ( ) while considering the existing models of Ramey, 1962; Hasan and \nKabir, 1991 and Cheng et al. (2011), based on the   , as follows \n\n \n\n ( )  \n\n{\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n      ?   (     ?  )               \n\n  ( ?  )        \n\n \n \n\n   \n[  (  \n\n \n\n \n*    (   )        ]  \n\n              \n\n  ( ?  )                   \n\n G.14 \n\n \n\nThe reason for adopting this approach meets the observations \n\nmade by Cheng et al. (2011) and Hasan and Kabir (1991). The former \n\npointed out that, for very short transient (      ), the correlation \nbased on the ratio between the formation and wellbore heat capacities \n\nshould not be employed since there is no significant contribution of the \n\nformation to the wellbore thermal behavior. The latter stated that, for \n\nvery short and for long transients, their approach presented an excellent \n\nagreement with the exact solution for the transient diffusion in the \n\nformation."}]}}}
