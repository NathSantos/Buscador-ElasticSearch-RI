In the ex-\nperimental part, an apparatus for the evaluation of passive and active\nmagnetic regenerators was designed and built. Different matrix ge-\nometries (parallel plates, pin arrays and packed beds of spheres) were\nevaluated in terms of their thermal performances. In the numerical\nanalysis, a mathematical model based on the finite volume method\nwas developed to solve the transient one-dimensional forms of the mo-\nmentum equation for the fluid flow through the porous matrix and\nthe energy equations for the fluid and solid phases. Different types of\nlosses were included in the model, such as the internal demagnetizing\nfield, heat transfer to the surroundings, axial heat conduction and void\nvolume losses. Finally, a methodology to optimize passive and active\nregenerators based on the Entropy Generation Minimization theory was\nproposed and implemented in the numerical model.\n\n\n\nlii Abstract\n\n\n\nliii\n\nResumo\n\nA pesquisa por tecnologias alternativas busca o desenvolvimento de\nsistemas te?rmicos com menor consumo energe?tico e ambientalmente\namiga?veis.

The development of cooling systems\nexpanded the possibilities in food storage, transport, conservation and\nthermal comfort. Certainly, refrigerators and air-conditioning systems\nwere fundamental to the evolution of the quality of life enjoyed in our\nsociety.\n\nThe most conventional cooling technology is based on the mechanical\ncompression and expansion of a vapor. The first compressors and re-\nfrigerators were over-designed, heavy and inefficient. However, vapor\ncompression technologies experienced numerous developments in the\n20th century. As a result, the compressors used today in a range of do-\nmestic and commercial applications are small, inexpensive and efficient,\nthus making the mechanical compression of refrigerants the dominant\ntechnology for a host of cooling applications.\n\nOver the last three decades or so, environmental and energy policies\nare being imposed to restrict the use of non-environmentally friendly\nsubstances and low efficiency conversion systems. As a result, the use\nof CFC and HCFC refrigerants that contribute to global warming and\nozone layer depletion has been suspended in several countries (UNITED\nNATIONS, 2015).\n\nPossible replacements of the non-environmentally friendly substances\nare the natural refrigerants, such as CO2 (R-744) and hydrocarbons,\nbut these may have some disadvantages in terms of energy efficiency\n(GIROTTO et al., 2004) or undesired physical-chemical properties such\nas flammability. Therefore, new technologies that are not based on\nthe use of harmful fluids and are capable of developing thermodynamic\nefficiencies at similar levels are being sought. In this scenario, magnetic\n\n\n\n2 1 Introduction\n\nrefrigeration is the one of the leading contenders among the so-called\nemerging technologies for the development of cooling and heat pumping\nsystems.\n\nMagnetic cooling does not rely on volatile refrigerants, as a magnetic\nsolid material is used as the refrigerant and an aqueous solution is the\nheat transfer agent between the magnetic material and the thermal\nreservoirs. Magnetic coolers can operate at low absolute pressures, are\nconceptually simpler than vapor compression equipment, since they can\nbe designed with fewer moving parts to generate less mechanical vibra-\ntion and noise (YU et al., 2003; PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 2006;\nGSCHNEIDNER JR.; PECHARSKY, 2008). Magnets can, in principle, be\nrecycled or reused in more advanced refrigerators, which constitutes an\neconomic benefit compared to other technologies. Finally, and more\nimportantly, magnetic refrigeration has the potential to be thermody-\nnamically more efficient, since it is, in principle, easier to perform a\nreversible magnetization of a magnetic material than a reversible com-\npression of a gas or vapor. As will be discussed later, the magnetocaloric\neffect is reversible.\n\nFig. 1.1 compares the Carnot cycles for gas compression and magnetic\nrefrigeration. The gas compression system is based on the fundamental\nprocesses of isentropic compression, (0)-(1), and expansion, (2)-(3),\nbetween the hot and cold reservoirs. Heat is removed isothermally\nfrom a cold reservoir (at TC), (3)-(0), and rejected isothermally at the\nhot reservoir (at TH), (1)-(2). The difference between QH and QC is\nequal to the net mechanical work transferred to the system.\n\nThe magnetic cooling system is based on the fundamental process of\nadiabatic magnetization, (0)-(1), and demagnetization, (2)-(3). In this\ncase, changes in magnetic flux density (?B) are responsible for es-\ntablishing a temperature difference between the hot and cold reser-\nvoirs, at TH and TC, respectively. Similarly, the difference between\nQH and QC is equal to the net magnetic work transfer to the system\n(STEYERT, 1978; KITANOVSKI; EGOLF, 2006). The temperature varia-\ntion of the solid magnetic material when the external magnetic flux den-\nsity is changed under adiabatic conditions is called the Magnetocaloric\nEffect (MCE).\n\nVapor compression systems can generate temperature spans between\nthe hot and cold reservoirs of the order of 40 to 70 K, which corre-\nspond to pressure changes between 10 and 20 bar for most refrigerants.\nThese are typical operating conditions for the majority of compres-\n\n\n\n1 Introduction 3\n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Carnot cycle comparison between vapor compression and\nmagnetic refrigeration. Adapted from Russek and Zimm (2006).\n\nsors in vapor compression systems. On the other hand, the MCE is\nof the order of a few degrees Kelvin, even for large magnetic flux den-\nsity variations. For example, the benchmark magnetocaloric material\nfor near room temperature applications, gadolinium (Gd), has a peak\nMCE around 15 K for a ?B of 7.5 T (DAN\u00b4KOV et al., 1998). At a more\nrealistic operating condition, ?B is expected to be around 1.0 T, for\nwhich the peak MCE is about 3.0 K (BAHL; NIELSEN, 2009). There-\nfore, even for large magnetic flux densities variations, the best known\nmagnetocaloric materials are not capable of providing temperature dif-\nferences compatible with those observed in gas or vapor compression\ntechnologies.\n\nTo overcome this thermodynamic limitation, magnetic cooling systems\nare based on regenerative cycles, in which the solid refrigerant is as-\nsembled as a regenerative matrix, and a heat transfer fluid is used as\na thermal exchange medium between the refrigerant and the cold and\nhot reservoirs. As a result of the intermittent heat transfer between the\nsolid matrix and the fluid during processes in an appropriate thermo-\nmagnetic cycle, such as the Brayton Cycle, the regenerator amplifies\nthe temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs (tem-\nperature span). This type of regenerator is called the Active Magnetic\nRegenerator (AMR) (BARCLAY; STEYERT, 1982). Tura (2005) obtained\n\n\n\n4 1 Introduction\n\nexperimentally a temperature span of 50 K for a ?B of 2.0 T in an\nAMR composed of Gd-alloys for which the peak MCE is approximately\n6.0 K for the same ?B (i.e., a gain factor of eight or so for the tem-\nperature span).\n\nThe use of thermal regenerators in magnetic cooling cycles brings about\nseveral technical challenges. The first one is the manufacture complex-\nity of the magnetocaloric material in an appropriate geometry that can\nbe used as a regenerative matrix, such as spheres, parallel plates, wire\nmeshes or pin arrays. Secondly, the operational complexity is increased,\nas complex sealing and flow distribution systems are required to gen-\nerate oscillating or bidirectional flows through the regenerative matrix\n(KUPPAN, 2000). Additionally, matrices are compact porous media\nwhich, when processing an aqueous heat transfer fluid, may cause a\ndramatic increase in viscous losses and pumping power.\n\nSingle-phase heat transfer between the process fluid (thermal agent)\nin the regenerator and in the heat exchangers connected to the ther-\nmal reservoirs increases the system irreversibilities due to sensible heat\ntransfer with a finite temperature difference. Thus, bigger heat trans-\nfer surface areas are required in both, hot and cold, heat exchangers,\nwhich increases the geometric complexity and the viscous losses.\n\nOther technical challenges are related to the magnetic field genera-\ntion. Joule heating of the magnetic circuit together with restrictions\nto magnetic flux densities in excess of 2 T due to health and safety\nissues (e.g., in domestic applications) limit the range of possibilities for\nthe magnetic field generation to rare earth permanent magnet circuits\n(KITANOVSKI et al., 2015). Monfared et al. (2014) presented a compre-\nhensive life cycle assessment of both magnetic and vapor-compression\nrefrigerators. They concluded that the designation of environmentally\nfriendly technology is questionable when considerable amounts of rare\nearth metals are required to build a magnetic refrigerator. Clearly, the\nhigh costs involved in the use of rare earth based permanent magnets\nand magnetocaloric materials is another important economic limita-\ntion.\n\nThe above discussion exposed some of the main limitations and chal-\nlenges for the technological development of magnetic cooling systems.\nIn this context, a specific research project on thermal regeneration can\ncontribute significantly to the field of magnetic refrigeration. Parame-\nters such as matrix (bed) geometry, casing geometry/dimensions, and\nthe identification and minimization of different types of losses (thermal,\n\n\n\n1.1 Objectives and Contributions 5\n\nhydrodynamic and magnetic losses) must be investigated systematically\nin order to improve and optimize the existing magnetic cooling devices\nor design more efficient ones. A list of desirable characteristics in a\nthermal regenerator for magnetic cooling applications is as follows:\n\n? High thermal effectiveness due to low heat transfer irreversibili-\nties;\n\n? Small viscous losses, resulting in simpler and smaller pumping\nsystems;\n\n? Small magnetic losses, resulting in a large MCE;\n\n? Compactness, resulting in lower torques, less mechanical losses\nand smaller motors. As a result, lighter magnetic circuits can be\nemployed, using smaller quantities of rare earth-based materials.\n\n1.1 Objectives and Contributions\n\nThe objective of the present thesis is to investigate experimentally and\nnumerically the behavior of active magnetic regenerators in order to\noptimize their performance, considering different matrix geometries.\n\nTo accomplish this objective, an evaluation of both, passive and active,\nmatrices with identical geometries and operating at the same condi-\ntions was carried out. In passive regenerators, the magnetic field is\nnot present, which facilitates the differentiation between losses that are\ncommon to both types of regenerators and those that are exclusive\nto active magnetic regenerators. This way, experiments with passive\nmatrices may help to quantify the influence of the porous medium ge-\nometry on the thermal-hydraulic performance of the regenerator inde-\npendently of losses taking place in the presence of a change in magnetic\nfield (i.e., magnetic losses).\n\nTo enable the development of this research work, the following actions\nwere pursued:\n\n? Design and build a versatile experimental apparatus to evaluate\npassive and active magnetic regenerators, for a variety of operat-\ning conditions and matrix geometries;\n\n\n\n6 1 Introduction\n\n? Develop a one-dimensional, transient finite volume-based numer-\nical model to evaluate and optimize the performance of passive\nand active magnetic regenerators.\n\nThe project was divided in two stages. The first stage involved the\nstudy of the thermal-hydraulic aspects of oscillating-flow passive regen-\nerators. The impact of the regenerative matrix geometry on the heat\ntransfer and on the viscous and thermal losses were studied experimen-\ntally and numerically using conventional materials for the regenerator\nmatrix (e.g., stainless steel). The following specific objectives have been\ndefined for this part of the study:\n\n? Perform experimental tests to determine the time-dependent tem-\nperature and pressure change behaviors in regenerators filled with\ndifferent regenerative matrix geometries (packed spheres, pin ar-\nrays and parallel plates). The independent operating parameters\nare the mass flow rate and the frequency;\n\n? Compare the experimental results for the different matrix geome-\ntries in terms of (i) the regenerator effectiveness as a function of\nthe number of transfer units and (ii) the pressure drop as a func-\ntion of the particle Reynolds number. Analysis such as these help\nto quantify the influence of thermal-hydraulic losses, such as axial\nconduction and viscous friction, on the regenerator performance;\n\n? Perform numerical simulations in order to reproduce the experi-\nmental results;\n\n? With the assistance of the numerical model, identify the appro-\npriate closure relationships for fluid flow and heat transfer for\neach specific regenerative matrix geometry;\n\n? Propose an optimization procedure for passive regenerators based\non the Entropy Generation Minimization theory (BEJAN, 1995)\ncombined with the Performance Evaluation Criteria of Webb and\nKim (2005).\n\nThe second stage was concerned with the thermal-hydraulic and mag-\nnetic aspects of active magnetic regenerators, thus enabling a more\nin-depth analysis of the impact of the magnetic losses on the AMR\nperformance. The specific objectives for this part of the study are as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n1.2 Outline of the Thesis 7\n\n? Perform experimental tests to determine the time-dependent tem-\nperature and pressure change behaviors in active magnetic regen-\nerators filled with different matrix geometries (packed spheres,\npin arrays and parallel plates). The time-dependent torque re-\nquired to rotate the magnet system is also evaluated experimen-\ntally. The independent operating parameters are the mass flow\nrate, frequency and the thermal load applied on the cold side;\n\n? Incorporate the thermo-magnetic phenomena in the numerical\nmodel and perform numerical simulations to reproduce the ex-\nperimental results;\n\n? Compare the experimental results for the different matrix geome-\ntries in terms of the temperature span, cooling capacity, coeffi-\ncient of performance and second-law efficiency. Analysis such as\nthese help to quantify the influence of both, thermal-hydraulic\nand magnetic, losses on the AMR performance;\n\n? Propose an optimization procedure for active magnetic regenera-\ntors based on the Entropy Generation Minimization theory (BE-\nJAN, 1995) combined with the Performance Evaluation Criteria\nof Webb and Kim (2005).\n\n1.2 Outline of the Thesis\n\nThe present thesis was divided into eight chapters as follows. In Chap-\nter 2 - Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n- the fundamentals and the state of the art of thermal regenerators\nare presented, from their basic operation as passive storage devices to\ntheir application in magnetic refrigeration. The thermodynamics of the\nmagnetocaloric effect is also discussed. Additionally, a review about\nmodeling and optimization of regenerators is presented. Chapter 3 -\nExperimental Apparatus - describes the design and construction of the\nlaboratory apparatus, the experimental procedure and data processing\nfor the passive and active magnetic regenerator experiments. Chapter\n4 - Problem Formulation and Solution Method - describes the numeri-\ncal modeling of passive and active magnetic regenerators, including the\nmodeling of the thermo-magnetic phenomena and the different types of\nlosses, i.e., the thermal-hydraulic and magnetic losses. Chapter 5 - Pas-\nsive Thermal Regenerators - presents the experimental and numerical\nresults for the passive regenerators, including a comparison between\n\n\n\n8 1 Introduction\n\nthe thermal performances of the different matrix geometries. A de-\ntailed accounting of the passive regenerator losses (e.g., void volume,\nentrance losses) is carried out. Chapter 6 - Active Magnetic Regener-\nators - presents the experimental data and numerical results for the\nactive magnetic regenerators, including a comparison between different\nmatrix geometries. As with the passive regenerators, the thermal and\nmagnetic losses in the active regenerators are quantified and discussed.\nChapter 7 - Optimization of Thermal Regenerators - describes the En-\ntropy Generation Minimization-based method developed to design pas-\nsive and active magnetic regenerators. Finally, Chapter 8 summarizes\nthe final considerations and recommendations for future work.\n\n\n\n9\n\n2 Fundamentals and State\nof the Art of Thermal\nRegenerators\n\nIn 1816, Robert Stirling built the first regenerative hot air engine.\nLater, in 1834, it was suggested by John Herschel that regenerative\nengines could be used as refrigerators. More than 100 years later, in\n1959, Gifford and McMahon developed a regenerative cryogenic refrig-\nerator to cool infrared detectors and laser amplifiers (ACKERMANN,\n1997). Nearly two decades later, Brown (1976) developed the first near\nroom-temperature magnetic heat pump and, a few years after that,\nBarclay and Steyert (1982) patented the active magnetic regenerator.\nHowever, a greater interest in magnetic cooling near the room tempera-\nture emerged mainly after 1997 with the discovery of special alloys with\nthe so-called \u2018giant\u2019 magnetocaloric effect by Pecharsky and Gschnei-\ndner Jr. (1997a). After that, several developments in magnetocaloric\nmaterials and magnetic cooling systems have been reported in the open\nliterature (YU et al., 2010; SMITH et al., 2012; KITANOVSKI et al., 2015).\n\nThis chapter reviews the fundamentals of thermal regeneration, with a\nspecial emphasis on the coupling of regenerator modeling with the mag-\nnetocaloric effect associated with the solid matrix. This combination\nresults in a unique regenerator type, the active magnetic regenerator\n(AMR), which is one of the focal points of this thesis. After presenting\nthe basics of the AMR cycle, some approaches to optimize AMRs are\nreviewed.\n\n\n\n10 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\n2.1 Applications of Thermal Regenerators\n\nRegenerators are storage-type heat exchangers in which hot and cold\nfluid streams flow in alternating directions through a porous matrix,\ngiving rise to intermittent heat transfer between the solid and the\nfluid. The regenerative matrix (or simply matrix) is the porous me-\ndium composed by solid material processed in a specified bed geome-\ntry (SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; HAUSEN, 1983; ACKERMANN, 1997;\nKUPPAN, 2000; SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009). Thermal\nregenerators have several industrial applications, such as waste heat\nrecovery in gas turbine or steam power plants and as internal heat\nexchangers in thermodynamic cycles (KUPPAN, 2000).\n\nIn cooling technologies, the applications of regenerative heat exchang-\ners can be classified according to the temperature range and type of\nheat transfer fluid. Gases are much more common than liquids and\nare the thermal agents in a number of cryogenic and low-temperature\ncycles, such as the Stirling, pulse-tube, thermoacoustic, Gifford- McMa-\nhon and Vuillemier cycles (KUPPAN, 2000; SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003). Re-\ngenerators that use liquids as thermal fluids are encountered in near\nroom-temperature conditions involving some magnetocaloric and elec-\ntrocaloric cooling cycles (OZBOLT et al., 2014; KITANOVSKI et al., 2015).\n\nDuring the hot-to-cold blow (or simply hot blow), the fluid at a higher\ntemperature exchanges heat with the solid phase, warming up the ma-\ntrix that stores thermal energy from the fluid phase. In the cold-to-hot\nblow (or simply cold blow), the matrix releases the stored energy as\nheat, warming up the fluid. As the matrix is alternately exposed to the\nhot and cold streams, its temperature and that of the fluid vary as a\nfunction of time. Thus, a so-called periodically developed condition is\nobserved after a number of cycles, in which the variations of temper-\nature with time (for the solid and fluid phases) are the same during\nsuccessive cycles.\n\nThe duration of the time periods of the hot and cold blows should al-\nlow for heat transfer between the solid and the fluid at every position\nof the matrix. Thus, temperature, pressure, flow velocity and ther-\nmophysical properties are essentially both time and space dependent.\nThis distinguishes regenerators from recuperators, where in the latter\nheat is transferred between two continual fluid streams across a fixed\nboundary. At steady state, the properties of both streams depend only\non the spatial position (KUPPAN, 2000).\n\n\n\n2.2 Types of Regenerators 11\n\nDue to the intermittent heat transfer and alternating flow condition, the\nfollowing are desirable characteristics in a regenerator matrix (SHAH;\nSEKULIC?, 2003; KUPPAN, 2000):\n\n1. High volumetric heat capacity;\n\n2. Compact, for minimum volume and reduction of the void space;\n\n3. Large thermal conductance, which can be achieved with a large\nheat transfer area per unit of volume and/or a high convective\n(interstitial) heat transfer coefficient;\n\n4. High permeability and non-obstructed porous media to minimize\nthe viscous losses;\n\n5. Axially discontinuous and/or highly thermally resistant in the\nflow direction to minimize axial heat conduction.\n\n2.2 Types of Regenerators\n\nThere are two basic regenerator designs: the fixed-bed (or stationary)\nand the rotary, as presented in Fig. 2.1. To perform the alternating\nflow periods, in the fixed-bed the hot and cold streams must be contin-\nuously alternated by means of directional valves, such as rotary, linear\nor solenoid valves and check valves. On the other hand, in the case of\na rotary regenerator the regenerative matrix must be rotated periodi-\ncally into and out of the fixed streams (KUPPAN, 2000; SHAH; SEKULIC?,\n2003; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009).\n\nFig. 2.1(a) illustrates the single matrix fixed-bed regenerator. In this\ncase, the overall cycle is discontinuous, since the heat interactions with\nthe thermal reservoirs occur only in a fraction of the total cycle period.\nThe hot blow period takes a fraction of the total period, where the\nblack lines represent the flow direction from the hot to the cold reser-\nvoir, passing through the regenerator. Next, the fluid exiting the regen-\nerator interacts with the cold reservoir. The remaining period fraction\nis dedicated to the cold blow, where by means of switch (rotary, linear\nor solenoid) valves or a double effect pump, the flow direction is alter-\nnated (black lines), and the fluid exiting the regenerator now interacts\nwith the hot reservoir. To have a continuous cycle in stationary regen-\nerators, multiple beds can be employed in parallel. In this case, the\n\n\n\n12 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nCold Blow Period\n\nMatrix\n\nHot Blow Period\n\nMatrix\nCold \n\nReserv.

Fig. 2.1(b) illustrates the case of a multiple fixed-\nbed regenerator, where the alternating flow in the matrix is achieved\nby changing the position of a switch (rotary, linear or solenoid) valve\nor a double effect pump. The rotary type regenerator is presented in\nFig. 2.1(c), where the hot and cold streams are generated by rotating\nthe matrix, thus ensuring a continuous cycle. In this case, the heat\ninteractions with the cold and hot reservoirs are performed during the\nwhole cycle.\n\nWhile fixed-bed regenerators are simpler to build and maintain, and\n\n\n\n2.3 Merits of Regenerators 13\n\nare less prone to leakages, they are usually less compact (smaller sur-\nface area per unit volume) and are more difficult to operate at high\nfrequencies than rotary-type regenerators.\n\n2.3 Merits of Regenerators\n\nA discussion about the desirable characteristics and types of regenera-\ntors enables highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of regenera-\ntors compared to other kinds of heat exchangers, such as fluid-fluid heat\nexchangers (recuperators). The main advantages are follows: (KUPPAN,\n2000; KREITH, 2000; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009)\n\n1. Simplicity: a regenerator matrix can be as simple as a bed of\nparticles, eliminating the need for complex accessories, such as\nelaborated gaskets and headers;\n\n2. Compactness: regenerators can be designed for a large heat trans-\nfer area per unit matrix volume;\n\n3. Cost: it is possible to obtain a thermal effectiveness approaching\nunity using inexpensive solid materials in a compact arrangement;\n\nIn contrast, the following disadvantages can be listed:\n\n1. Large matrix heat capacity: to achieve a high thermal effective-\nness, the heat capacity of the solid matrix has to be larger than\nthat of the working fluid. This is a special concern when the\nworking fluid is an aqueous solution, which may result in a heavy\nregenerator;\n\n2. Friction losses: highly compact regenerators (i.e., with a large\nsurface area density) can produce high viscous losses;\n\n3. Alternating flow: changes of flow direction (in fixed-bed units) re-\nsult in additional flow irreversibilities, increasing the regenerator\npressure drop;\n\n4. Leakages: the performance of regenerators is very sensitive to\nleakages, which may result in undesired mixing of the streams\n(SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003). Pressure leakages are caused by pressure\n\n\n\n14 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\ndifferences between the hot and cold streams and are of special\nconcern in gas regenerators. Carryover leakages in a gas regen-\nerator are the transport of trapped fluid in the void spaces of\nthe matrix to the other fluid side due to matrix rotation. In a\nfixed-bed regenerator, the carryover leakage corresponds to the\nfluid that changes its direction outside the regenerator, i.e., in\nthe headers and/or in the spaces between each thermal reservoir\nand the nearest regenerator end (see Fig. 2.1(a)). Also known\nas void (or dead) volume losses, carryover losses in single fixed-\nbed regenerators impose a penalty on the regenerator thermal\nperformance as they correspond to a fluid volume that has been\ndisplaced but does not interact thermally with the thermal reser-\nvoirs, thereby producing neither a cooling nor a heating effect at\nthe reservoirs.\n\n2.4 Thermal Fluids Used in Regenerators\n\n2.4.1 Gases\n\nAs mentioned above, cryogenics is the main field of application of ther-\nmal regenerators that employ gases as heat transfer fluids. Ackermann\n(1997) presents a comprehensive discussion of the theory and design\nof regenerative heat exchangers for cryogenic applications. The Stir-\nling cryocooler (piston-displacer configuration), illustrated in Fig. 2.2,\nis used in many cryogenic applications, including cooling of spacecraft\ninstruments, infrared thermal imaging systems and superconducting\nelements. Ibrahim and Tew Jr (2012) reviewed the latest developments\nin regenerator research, from modeling and computational fluid dynam-\nics (CFD) analyses to applications of Stirling regenerators.\n\nNoble gases, such as helium (He), are the preferred thermal fluid in gas\nregenerators for their high specific heat capacity ratio. The Stirling cy-\ncle starts with the compression, (1)-(2), of the gas by the power piston,\nwhile heat, QH, is rejected to the external ambient to achieve a near\nisothermal compression, at TH. Next, in process (2)-(3), the displacer\npiston moves the high-pressure gas through the regenerator where the\nhot gas releases heat to the matrix and is cooled to a lower operating\ntemperature. This process occurs approximately at a constant volume.\nThe cold high-pressure gas coming from the regenerator is expanded,\nin process (3)-(4), by the coupled motion of the power and displacer\n\n\n\n2.4 Thermal Fluids Used in Regenerators 15\n\nExpansion\n\nRegenerator\n\nDisplacer\nPiston\n\nPower\nPiston\n\nTH\n\nQH\nTC\n\nQC\n\nRegeneration\nat v~cte\n\nCompression\n\nRegeneration\nat v~cte\n\nS [a.u.]\n\nT\n [\n\na\n.u\n\n.]\n\n(1)(2)\n\n(3) (4)\n\nTH\n\nTC\n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Schematic Stirling cryocooler and corresponding T-S dia-\ngram. Adapted from Kreith (2000).\n\npistons, while the heat load, QC, is transferred to the gas from the\nlow-temperature region at the cold end of the cylinder to achieve a\nnear-isothermal expansion, at TC. Finally, in process (4)-(1), the cold\nlow-pressure gas flows back through the regenerator driven by the dis-\nplacer piston. The gas receives heat from the matrix and is warmed up\nbefore returning to the initial condition (KREITH, 2000).\n\nde Boer (1994, 1995) presented a thermodynamic analyses of pulse-\ntube refrigerators with and without regenerators. The results led to\nthe conclusion that the use of a regenerator increases significantly the\nheat removal per cycle, the coefficient of performance and the refriger-\nation (i.e., second-law) efficiency. These results show the importance\nof the application of regenerators in thermodynamic cycles and can be\nextended to clarify the importance of optimized regenerators design.\n\n\n\n16 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nA number of experimental and numerical approaches have been devel-\noped to study the fluid flow and heat transfer in passive regenerators\nworking with gases under oscillating flow conditions (GEDEON; WOOD,\n1996; JU et al., 1998; LEE et al., 1998; NAM; JEONG, 2005, 2006; CHEN\net al., 2007; CHA et al., 2008; JU; SHEN, 2009). The general objectives\nof these works are to predict and correlate the friction factor and Nus-\nselt number to overcome the inaccuracies of conventional models for\nsteady state, which tend to fail at high oscillating frequencies (> 10\nHz). The prediction methods were developed for a range of different\ngeometries, such as wire meshes, parallel wires, tubes and plates, and\ndifferent porosities (generally higher than 0.6, which is usual for gas\napplications).\n\n2.4.2 Liquids\n\nThe application of liquids as thermal fluids in regenerators gained more\nimportance with the development of magneto and electrocaloric cooling\nsystems (OZBOLT et al., 2014; KITANOVSKI et al., 2015). However, most\nmodels available in the literature are based on relationships for steady-\nstate porous media, single blow or oscillating-flow regenerators that use\nlow Prandtl-number fluids, i.e., gases.\n\nMarconnet (2007) designed and built a single-blow regenerator test\nsetup to study heat transfer in packed beds of spheres using water and\nwater-glycol mixtures as heat transfer fluids. The proposed approach\nwas to compare the experimental and the numerical time-dependent\ntemperature data to adjust the A and B constants of the Nusselt num-\nber correlation of Wakao and Kaguei (1982)1, given by,\n\nNu = A + BRe\n3/5\nD Pr\n\n1/3 (2.1)\n\nFrischmann et al. (2008), Engelbrecht (2008) and Knauf et al. (2008)\nused the same apparatus as Marconnet (2007) to evaluate the per-\nformance of friction factor and Nusselt number correlations for packed\nspheres. The general conclusion was that the Wakao and Kaguei (1982)\ncorrelation overestimated the Nusselt number for aqueous solutions as\n\n1Wakao and Kaguei (1982) derived their correlation from experimental results\nthat used gases as heat transfer fluid. A more in-depth discussion about the validity\nof this correlation for aqueous fluids will be presented later in this thesis.\n\n\n\n2.4 Thermal Fluids Used in Regenerators 17\n\nheat transfer fluids at low Reynolds numbers (&lt;100). On the other\nhand, the well established correlation of MacDonald et al. (1979) for\nthe friction factor in packed bed porous media gave satisfactory results,\nwith deviations of the order of the experimental uncertainties.\n\nSchopfer (2010) investigated both experimentally and theoretically the\nthermal-hydraulic behavior of oscillating-flow regenerators using water\nas the heat transfer fluid. Two different matrix geometries were studied:\npacked beds of spheres and micro-channels. Schopfer (2010) proposed\na new Nusselt number correlation for both geometries in terms of a\ndimensionless frequency known as the kinetic Reynolds number (SI-\nMON; SEUME, 1988). The Nusselt number results for the packed bed of\nspheres exhibited different trends with respect to the single-blow exper-\nimental results of Engelbrecht (2008). On the other hand, the friction\nfactor results showed a fair agreement with the model predictions, of\nthe order of the experimental uncertainties.\n\nEngelbrecht et al. (2011) investigated the effects of porosity, corruga-\ntion angle and the presence of dimples on the performance of parallel\nplate regenerators. The plates were made of aluminum with 0.4 mm\nthickness. The experimental analysis was carried out for a range of\ncycle periods and utilization values. The best performance was found\nfor a 90o corrugated plate regenerator. Also, a decrease of the porosity\nby reducing the plate spacing did not result in a significant increase\nin performance, although the heat transfer coefficient was expected to\nincrease with the plate spacing.\n\nScarpa et al. (2012) developed a Kalman filter-based inverse method\nand applied it to numerically simulated experiments to determine the\ninterstitial convective heat transfer coefficient in regenerators using liq-\nuids. A one-dimensional model was used to describe the heat transfer in\nthe regenerator. The identification (reconstruction) of the heat transfer\ncoefficient was based on the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures. The\nauthors demonstrated that there was an optimal operating frequency of\nthe inlet fluid temperature at which the heat transfer coefficient could\nbe determined with the greatest precision (minimum standard devia-\ntion). At the time of the study, the model had not been applied to\nreal data and the influences of parameters such as mass flow rate and\neffective conductivities of both the fluid and solid matrix had not been\nquantified.\n\nTrevizoli et al. (2013, 2014) performed experiments with passive regen-\nerators using water as the thermal fluid. The study aimed at quanti-\n\n\n\n18 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nfying the fluid pumping power and the regenerator heat transfer effec-\ntiveness as a function of operating parameters such as frequency and\nutilization factor. Three different packed beds were used: 1-mm diam-\neter stainless steel spheres, 0.5-mm diameter lead spheres and 0.5-mm\ndiameter gadolinium spheres. For equivalent ranges of utilization, all\nmatrices presented a high effectiveness, with the lead matrix showing\nthe highest effectiveness and the smallest pumping power, due to a\ncombination of large surface area per unit volume (small particle di-\nameter) and low mass flow rates (large NTU). However, due to the\nlow fluid velocities, the lead matrix was more susceptible to axial con-\nduction losses. The gadolinium matrix exhibited a large effectiveness\nimbalance between the cold and hot blows due to a strong variation of\nthe solid specific heat capacity with temperature. The Gd matrix also\nexhibited the highest viscous losses due to the small particle size and\nhigh superficial velocities, for the same utilization ranges.\n\nAlthough the number of studies on the performance of passive regener-\nators using liquids has increased in the past decade, a systematic study\non the subject is still lacking. New data and improved models are there-\nfore extremely valuable for the development of improved methods for\nactive magnetocaloric regenerators. Without the need to deal with the\nmagnetocaloric phenomena during the early stages of the development,\nthe test regenerators can be manufactured with more conventional ma-\nterials, at a much lower cost. This enables evaluating other promising\nregenerative matrix geometries for application in AMRs, such as paral-\nlel plates, packed beds of spheres or irregular particles, and pin arrays.\n\n2.5 The Ideal Regenerator\n\nIn a perfectly insulated regenerator with an infinite heat transfer (in-\nterstitial) area, the fluid temperature exiting the cold end, Tf|CE, will\nbe equal to the temperature of the cold reservoir, TC. Conversely, the\nfluid temperature exiting the hot end, Tf|HE, will be equal to the tem-\nperature of the hot reservoir, TH. In this externally reversible situation,\nthe thermal effectiveness of the regenerator is 100%. However, this does\nnot guarantee the internal reversibility. In order for a regenerator to\nbe cast as ideal (internally reversible), the following hypotheses must\nbe fulfilled:\n\n\n\n2.5 The Ideal Regenerator 19\n\n1. Constant fluid and solid properties;\n\n2. Constant flow velocity;\n\n3. No fluid leakage;\n\n4. Constant inlet fluid temperature;\n\n5. Negligible thermal resistance in the transverse direction (normal\nto the flow);\n\n6. Infinite heat conduction resistance in the streamwise direction;\n\n7. Uniform interstitial heat transfer coefficient2;\n\n8. No losses to the surrounding and no mixing of streams;\n\n9. Negligible thermal capacity of the fluid compared to that of the\nsolid matrix.\n\nThe latter assumption translates into the following relationship:\n\n(mcp)|f\n(mc)|s\n\n<&lt;1 (2.2)\n\nwhere c and cp are the specific heat capacities of the solid and fluid\nphases, respectively, and m is the mass of each phase. The subscripts\n\u2018s\u2019 and \u2018f\u2019 stand for the solid and fluid phases, respectively.\n\nGenerally, for regenerators operating with gases, the thermal capacity\nratio constraint presented in Eq. (2.2) is easily fulfilled. Important ex-\nceptions are the helium cryogenic regenerators, for which at 6 K the\nheat capacity of the fluid becomes one order of magnitude larger than\nthat of the matrix (ACKERMANN, 1997). On the other hand, in passive\nand active magnetic regenerators using aqueous solutions as thermal\nagents, Eq. (2.2) is hardly ever valid. For AMRs, the thermal capac-\nity ratio varies from 0.1 to much grater than 1 and, in general, the\nperformance peaks is around 1. In the AMR literature, the thermal ca-\npacity ratio is commonly referred to as the utilization factor (or simply\nutilization) (NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009).\n\n2Ideally, the convective heat transfer coefficient should approach infinity.\n\n\n\n20 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nThe heat transfer in an ideal regenerator is modeled mathematically\nby the following differential heat balances in the solid and fluid phases\n(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN, 1997; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009):\n\n(mc)|s\n?Ts\n?t\n\n= hAHT(Ts ?Tf) (2.3)\n\n0 = h\nAHT\nL\n\n(Tf ?Ts) + (m?cp)|f\n?Tf\n?z\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, AHT is the heat\ntransfer area, L is the regenerator length, t is the time and m? is the\nmass flow rate. Note that in the ideal regenerator the transient term in\nthe fluid energy equation can be neglected since the thermal capacity\nof the fluid phase is small compared with the solid phase. The initial\nand boundary conditions for this model are as follows:\n\n? At t = 0, Ts = Ti, where Ti is a given initial temperature;\n\n? For the hot blow: Tf|HE = TH at z = 0;\n\n? For the cold blow: Tf|CE = TC at z = L.\n\nThe exact solution of Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) can be found in different\nreferences. Schmidt and Willmott (1981) p. 20, presented a classical\nsolution based on the dimensionless time and length. In a different\napproach, Dragutinovic and Baclic (1998) solved analytically the same\nequation in terms of the NTU and utilization factor, which will be\npresented in the next section.\n\n2.6 Regenerator Design and Performance\nParameters\n\nRegenerators are usually designed based on the following parameters\n(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; HAUSEN, 1983; ACKERMANN, 1997):\n\n1. Overall thermal conductance, UAHT, where U is the overall heat\ntransfer coefficient;\n\n\n\n2.6 Regenerator Design and Performance Parameters 21\n\n2. Temperatures of the cold and hot inlet streams, TC,in and TH,in;\n\n3. Thermal capacity of the fluid during the hot and cold blows, CHB\nand CCB, where C = m?cp;\n\n4. Thermal capacity of the matrix ((mc)|s);\n\n5. Operating frequency;\n\nThe performance of a regenerator is evaluated based on the average\noutlet fluid temperatures at the cold and hot ends, T C,out and T H,out.\nUndoubtedly, these outlet average temperatures are a function of the\ndesign parameters listed above. However, the regenerator performance\nis more commonly evaluated in terms of non-dimensional variables\n(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; HAUSEN, 1983; ACKERMANN, 1997; SHAH;\nSEKULIC?, 2003; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009).\n\nBased on Eq. (2.2), the first dimensionless parameter to be defined is\nthe utilization factor, ?, which for a fixed bed regenerator is given by,\n\n? =\nm?cp?blow|f\nmc|s\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere ?blow is the time period of one blow. The utilization is the\nratio of the thermal capacity of the fluid phase flowing through the\nregenerator during one blow (hot or cold) and the thermal capacity of\nthe regenerator solid matrix. As mentioned above, a good regenerator\nmust have a large matrix heat capacity so that it can store energy from\nthe fluid without changing temperature substantially (NELLIS; KLEIN,\n2009).\n\nThe second dimensionless parameter is the number of heat transfer\nunits, NTU, which can be intuitively related to the thermal size of the\nheat exchanger (SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009):\n\nNTU =\nUAHT\nC\n\n?????\nblow\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn principle, as shown in Eq. (2.6), NTU can be evaluated separately\nfor the cold and hot blows. Additionally, regenerators can be evaluated\nin terms of the modified number of transfer units, NTUo, given by,\n\n\n\n22 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nNTUo =\nUoAHT\nCmin\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere\n\n1\n\nUo\n=\n\n1\n\nh\n\n?????\nHB\n\n+\n1\n\nh\n\n?????\nCB\n\n(2.8)\n\nAlthough Eq. (2.8) indicates that the two convection thermal resis-\ntances associated with each blow are connected in series, this is not\ntrue for a regenerator, since there is no direct heat transfer between\nthe hot and cold streams. In the so-called balanced regenerator, the\nmass flow rates of the cold and hot blows are identical and the hot and\ncold blow periods are the same. Thus, the thermal capacity rates of the\ncold and hot streams are identical, Cmin = CCB = CHB, and the NTU\nis the same for both blows (SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN,\n1997; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009):\n\nNTUo =\nNTU\n\n2\n(2.9)\n\nIn the present thesis, balanced flow conditions were used in all experi-\nments. Thus, the results will be always evaluated in terms of NTU.\n\nThe third and last non-dimensional parameter is the thermal effective-\nness, ?. The effectiveness is a measure of how good the real regen-\nerator is when compared with a perfect regenerator subjected to the\nsame temperature difference between the thermal reservoirs (SCHMIDT;\nWILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN, 1997; SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003; NELLIS;\nKLEIN, 2009). Thus:\n\n? =\nQblow\nQmax\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere Qblow is the actual amount of heat transferred from or to the ma-\ntrix in a given blow (hot or cold) and Qmax is the maximum possible\namount of heat transferred from or to the matrix in a perfect regener-\nator. Under balanced flow conditions, the thermal effectiveness can be\nexpressed in terms of the average outlet temperatures as follows:\n\n\n\n2.6 Regenerator Design and Performance Parameters 23\n\n?CB =\nT H,out ?TC,in\nTH,in ?TC,in\n\n(2.11)\n\n?HB = 1 ?\nT C,out ?TC,in\nTH,in ?TC,in\n\n(2.12)\n\nDragutinovic and Baclic (1998) solved analytically and numerically the\ngoverning energy equations for ideal regenerators (Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4)).\nFig. 2.3 presents the results for the effectiveness as a function of NTU\nand utilization for balanced and symmetric ideal regenerators. As can\nbe seen, only regenerators with an utilization lower than unity are\ncapable of reaching 100% effectiveness. This limit is reached earlier (i.e.,\nsmaller values of NTU) as the utilization approaches zero (negligible\nthermal capacity of the fluid stream). For an utilization factor higher\nthan unity, the maximum achievable effectiveness is lower than 100%.\nTherefore, it is not possible to attain perfect regeneration when the\nthermal capacity of the fluid exceeds that of the matrix. Also, the\nmaximum achievable effectiveness is reached earlier (i.e., smaller values\nof NTU) as the utilization factor increases above unity (ACKERMANN,\n1997; NELLIS; KLEIN, 2009).\n\nThe ideal regenerator solution helps to understand the influence of the\nbasic design parameters on the actual regenerator performance. How-\never, any real regenerator design must incorporate real effects and losses\nin order to provide a true estimate of the performance of a real cooling\nsystem. The following is a list of phenomena that must be accounted\nfor in the modeling of regenerators aiming at applications in magnetic\ncooling:\n\n1. Thermal capacity of the fluid phase so as to deal with regenerators\nthat use aqueous solutions as thermal agents;\n\n2. Viscous dissipation, which may become significant in highly com-\npact regenerators with a large heat transfer area per unit of vol-\nume and a low porosity;\n\n3.

Effective properties of the porous medium (e.g., dispersion) as a\nfunction of the flow regime.\n\n2.7 The Magnetocaloric Effect\n\nThe Magnetocaloric Effect (MCE) is the thermal response of a mag-\nnetic material when subjected to a changing magnetic field. The his-\ntorical aspects of the MCE, including its discovery in 1917 by Weiss\nand Piccard are presented and discussed in the review article by Smith\n(2013).\n\nPhysically, the MCE is a manifestation of the entropy variation of the\nmaterial due to the coupling of the magnetic moments in the material\nwith the magnetic field. A suitable engineering approximation for the\nmajority of magnetocaloric materials is to assume that the specific en-\ntropy of the solid material, s, is the sum of three main contributions:\nelectronic, sele, lattice, slat, and magnetic, smag. sele and slat are as-\n\n\n\n2.7 The Magnetocaloric Effect 25\n\nsumed to depend only on the temperature, while smag is a function\nof the temperature and the external magnetic flux density3 (TISHIN;\nSPICHKIN, 2003; PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 1999; PECHARSKY et\nal., 2001; SMITH et al., 2012):\n\ns(T,B) = smag(T,B) + sele(T) + slat(T) (2.13)\n\nWhen the external magnetic flux density on the solid magnetocaloric\nmaterial is changed from B0 to B1, the resulting MCE can be quan-\ntified in terms of the two thermodynamic process presented in the\ntemperature-specific entropy (T-s) diagram in Fig. 2.4.\n\nT\n\ns\n\nB0 = 0\n\nB1 > 0\n?Tad\n\n ?smag \n\ns0\n\ns1\n\nT0 T1\n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Illustration of the isothermal and adiabatic magnetization\nprocesses in a T-s diagram. Adapted from Pecharsky and Gschneidner\nJr. (1999).\n\n3In general, the applied magnetic flux density, B, is represented by the applied\nmagnetic field, H. These quantities are related by B = \u00b50H, where \u00b50 is the\nmagnetic permeability of the vacuum and, essentially, represent the same quantity.\nTo be consistent with the theoretical formalism, in the present thesis, the magnetic\nflux density will be used.\n\n\n\n26 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nIf the magnetic flux density is varied under isothermal conditions, the\nlattice and electronic contributions to the total entropy do not change,\nand the MCE is characterized by the total entropy variation from s0 to\ns1, which is proportional to the magnetic entropy variation as follows:\n\n?smag(T, ?B) ? ?s(T, ?B) = s1(T,B) ?s0(T,B) (2.14)\n\nOn the other hand, if the magnetic flux density is varied under adi-\nabatic conditions, the total entropy remains constant. Thus, the re-\nsulting magnetic entropy variation is thermically compensated by the\nelectronic and lattice entropies and, as a result, the temperature of the\nmaterials changes from T0 to T1:\n\n??smag(T,B) = ?sele(T) + ?slat(T) (2.15)\n\n2.7.1 Thermodynamics of the MCE\n\nThe isothermal entropy variation, also referred in the literature as the\nmagnetic entropy variation, ?smag(T, ?B), can be evaluated by the\nfollowing Maxwell relationship that relates entropy and the specific\nmagnetization, ?, which are both functions of temperature and mag-\nnetic flux density:\n\n(\n?s\n\n?B\n\n)\nT\n\n=\n\n(\n??\n\n?T\n\n)\nB\n\n(2.16)\n\nIntegration of Eq. (2.16) leads to:\n\n?s(T, ?B) =\n\n? B1\nB0\n\n(\n??(T,B)\n\n?T\n\n)\ndB (2.17)\n\nThe entropy can also be related to the specific heat capacity (c) by:\n\n(\n?s\n\n?T\n\n)\nB\n\n=\nc(T,B)\n\nT\n(2.18)\n\n\n\n2.7 The Magnetocaloric Effect 27\n\nEq. (2.18) can be integrated to determine the entropy change if the\nspecific heat capacity as a function of temperature and magnetic flux\ndensity is known. Thus:\n\n?s(T, ?B) =\n\n? T\n0\n\n1\n\nT\n\n[\nc(B1,T) ? c(B0,T)\n\n]\ndT (2.19)\n\nAt constant pressure, volume and composition, the entropy can be\nwritten in terms of temperature and magnetic flux density as follows:\n\nds =\n\n(\n?s\n\n?T\n\n)\nB\n\ndT +\n\n(\n?s\n\n?B\n\n)\nT\n\ndB (2.20)\n\nFor a reversible adiabatic (i.e., isentropic) process, substituting Eqs.\n(2.16) and (2.18) in Eq. (2.20) gives:\n\ndT = ?\nT\n\nc(T,B)\n\n(\n??\n\n?T\n\n)\nB\n\ndB (2.21)\n\nIntegration of Eq. (2.21) results in the adiabatic temperature variation,\n?Tad, which is formally defined as:\n\n?Tad(T, ?B) = T1(s0(T1,B1)) ?T0(s0(T0,B0)) (2.22)\n\nThus, upon integration one has:\n\n?Tad(T, ?B) = ?\n? B1\nB0\n\n(\nT\n\nc(T,B)\n\n)(\n??(T,B)\n\n?T\n\n)\ndB (2.23)\n\nSince the MCE depends on the temperature and on the intensity of the\nmagnetic flux density variation, it presents a single peak around the\n\ntransition temperature where\n(\n??\n?T\n\n)\nis maximum. This temperature\n\ntransition is called the Curie Temperature, TCurie (TISHIN; SPICHKIN,\n2003; PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 1999; PECHARSKY et al., 2001;\nSMITH et al., 2012). Fig. 2.5 illustrates the behavior of ?Tad and cH (the\nspecific heat capacity at constant magnetic field) of gadolinium (SID-\n\n\n\n28 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nDIKOV et al., 2005), for which TCurie was about 295 K in that particular\nset of experiments. For gadolinium, at low magnetic flux densities, the\nCurie Temperature has been reported within the range of 290 to 297\nK (BAHL; NIELSEN, 2009), which largely depends on the level of purity\nof the sample.\n\nK\n)\n\n?\nT a\nd\n(K\n\n(a)\n\nJ/\nkg\n\n.K\n)\n\nc H\n(J\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 (a) ?Tad and (b) cH as a function of the temperature and\nmagnetic flux density.

The reversibility of the MCE has been demon-\nstrated experimentally based on direct measurements of ?Tad in Gd\nsamples (BAHL; NIELSEN, 2009; TREVIZOLI et al., 2012). Fig. 2.6 shows\nthe sample temperature when it is initially magnetized and then de-\nmagnetized a few moments later.\n\nStarting with the sample at zero external magnetic flux density, and\nthe initial temperature T0 around 293.15 K, the sample is magnetized\nadiabatically and its temperature increases to T1 = T0 +?Tad(T0, ?B).\nIn the case illustrated in Fig. 2.6, T1 is around 297 K and ?Tad,mag is\nabout 3.8 K. After the adiabatic demagnetization, the temperature\ndropped to T2 = T1 + ?Tad(T1, ?B). Experimentally, T2 was observed\nto be very close to T0, and ?Tad,demag was about -3.8 K. Thus, in\nsimple mathematical terms (NIELSEN et al., 2010):\n\n\n\n2.7 The Magnetocaloric Effect 29\n\n?Tad,mag(T0, ?B) = ??Tad,demag(T0 + ?Tad,mag(T0, ?B), ?B)\n(2.24)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n293.0\n\n293.5\n\n294.0\n\n294.5\n\n295.0\n\n295.5\n\n296.0\n\n296.5\n\n297.0\n\n297.5\n\n?\nT\n\nad\n,m\n\nag\n =\n\n 3\n.8\n\n1 \nK\n\n?\nT\n\nad\n,d\n\nem\nag\n\n =\n 3\n\n.8\n6 \n\nK\n\nT\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n (K\n)\n\ntime (s)\n\nEquilibrium temperature 293.15 K\nND = 0.687\n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Experimental demonstration of the reversibility of the\nMCE in Gd. The change in magnetic flux density was approximately\n1.65 T. Adapted from Trevizoli et al. (2012).\n\nThe result described above can be explained on the grounds of the\nreversibility of MCE under conditions of zero heat transfer between\nthe sample and the surroundings. Neglecting any kind of internal ir-\nreversibility (homogeneous material, uniform temperature variations),\nthe system is expected to perform a cycle and return to the original\nstate (i.e., zero total entropy variation) with zero entropy generation\n(TREVIZOLI et al., 2012). As a result, a distinct temperature shift is ob-\nserved when comparing the ?Tad,mag and ?Tad,demag curves as a func-\ntion of temperature. Fig. 2.7 shows the direct measurement results of\n?Tad under adiabatic magnetization and demagnetization. The exper-\nimental results for demagnetization are compared with the theoretical\nprediction using Eq. (2.24).

Fig. 2.8 shows\na comparison of the magnetocaloric properties of different materials\napplicable in low- and room-temperature cooling (GSCHNEIDNER JR. et\nal., 2000, 2005).\n\nAccording to Rowe et al. (2005b), for applications around room tem-\nperature, the ?Tad of magnetocaloric materials must be greater than\n2 K/T. Nevertheless, other important properties should be considered,\nsuch as (YU et al., 2003; TURA, 2005; GSCHNEIDNER JR.; PECHARSKY,\n2008):\n\n\n\n2.7 The Magnetocaloric Effect 31\n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 (a) Isothermal entropy change; (b) Adiabatic temperature\nchange for different magnetocaloric materials.

Minimum thermal and magnetic hysteresis;\n\n? Large specific heat capacity to increase the thermal mass of the\nregenerative matrix;\n\n? High thermal conductivity to improve the regenerator effective-\nness;\n\n? Chemical stability to avoid corrosion;\n\n? Large electrical resistance to avoid eddy currents;\n\n? Good mechanical properties to facilitate the manufacturing pro-\ncess;\n\n? Low cost.\n\nGadolinium (Gd) is the benchmark material for applications around\nroom temperature. Since the discovery of the \u2018giant\u2019 MCE in Gd5(Ge,Si)\nalloys (PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 1997b), several different sys-\ntems with large MCE have been reported, of which the most promising\n\n\n\n32 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nones are the La(Fe,Si) and MnFe-based alloys (BRU?CK et al., 2008).\nTable 2.1 presents some important properties and characteristics of\npromising magnetocaloric materials compared with Gd.\n\nTable 2.1 \u2013 Promissing magnetocaloric materials properties and char-\nacteristics compared with Gd.

Regarding the MCE de-\npendence, it is highest at the Curie temperature and decreases as the\ntemperature gradually deviates from TCurie, as shown in Fig. 2.9. To\nillustrate this, an AMR operating with a hypothetical material with a\ntemperature span of 70 K, where TC = 253 K and TH = 323 K, is shown\nin Fig. 2.9(a). The MCE at TCurie is ?6.5 K, and decreases to ?2.5\nK close to the cold end and to ?1.5 K close to the hot end. To avoid\nthis reduction of the MCE and achieve better performances, different\nmagnetocaloric materials with different values of TC can be combined\nsequentially in the regenerator in order to maintain locally a MCE as\nlarge as possible, as shown in Fig. 2.9(b). Several authors explored\nthe concept of multi-material regenerators (HASHIMOTO et al., 1987;\nSMAI?LI; CHAHINE, 1997; OKAMURA et al., 2006; HIRANO et al., 2010).\nTura (2005) observed an increase of the maximum temperature span\n(zero thermal load) from ?20 K using a single-layer Gd regenerator to\n?50 K for a multi-layer regenerator composed by layers of Gd85Er15,\nGd74Tb26 and Gd. An identical magnetic field change was applied in\nthe two situations.\n\nRegarding the specific heat capacity, there is a strong dependence with\nrespect to the applied magnetic flux density and temperature, as shown\nin Fig. 2.10 for gadolinium.

As pointed\nout by several authors (NIELSEN et al., 2011; TREVIZOLI et al., 2014), the\nlocal heat transfer in the regenerative matrix can be severely influenced\nby changes in specific heat capacity, which has obvious consequences\nto the regenerator performance.\n\n\n\n34 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\n2.8 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\n2.8.1 The AMR Cycle\n\nMagnetic refrigeration systems can be built according to different ther-\nmodynamic cycles, such as the Carnot, Ericsson, Stirling and Brayton\ncycles (KITANOVSKI; EGOLF, 2006; KITANOVSKI et al., 2015). However,\nsince the MCE is small, i.e., of the order of 3 K/T at low magnetic flux\ndensities for the current magnetocaloric materials, large temperature\nspans cannot be achieved, unless some kind of thermal regeneration is\nused. In the active magnetic regenerator (AMR), the magnetocaloric\nmaterial is employed as a solid regenerative matrix so as to amplify\nthe temperature span by exchanging heat with a thermal agent (heat\ntransfer fluid) (BARCLAY; STEYERT, 1982).\n\nRegenerative cycles enable achieving large temperature spans and large\ncooling capacities. The Brayton cycle is the most common thermo-\nmagnetic regenerative cooling cycle, and is schematically presented in\nFig. 2.11. The following idealized steps, shown in a T-S diagram in\nFig. 2.12, make up the idealized thermo-magnetic Brayton cooling cycle\n(ROWE et al., 2005a):\n\n1. Adiabatic magnetization: by changing adiabatically the magnetic\nfield applied on the matrix, the total entropy of the magnetic solid\nremains constant. However, the decrease in magnetic entropy due\nto the magnetic field variation is compensated by an increase in\nthe lattice and electronic entropies. As a result, the tempera-\nture of the magnetic material increases, which characterizes the\nmagnetocaloric effect (MCE).\n\n2. Constant magnetic field cold blow: after the adiabatic magnetiza-\ntion, cold fluid (at TC) flows through the matrix, cools down the\nsolid phase (which releases heat to the fluid) and rejects heat to\na hot source at TH.\n\n3. Adiabatic demagnetization: similarly to the adiabatic magnetiza-\ntion, the demagnetization process reduces the temperature of the\nsolid material, which undergoes an adiabatic temperature change.\n\n4. Constant magnetic field hot blow: hot fluid (at TH) returns through\nthe matrix, and the solid phase removes heat from the fluid phase,\n\n\n\n2.8 Active Magnetic Regenerators 35\n\nincreasing the internal energy of the matrix.

The MCE itself depends on the applied field\nchange, i.e., the higher the magnetic flux density variation the higher\nthe MCE, and on the magnetic properties of the magnetic material.\nThe effectiveness, in turn, depends on the solid phase thermophysical\nproperties, matrix geometry, thermal capacity, porosity and operating\nparameters, such as frequency and flow velocity (ROWE et al., 2005a;\nTURA; ROWE, 2011; NIELSEN et al., 2012; TREVIZOLI et al., 2014).\n\n2.8.2 Numerical Modeling of AMRs\n\nThe mathematical modeling of AMRs is a multidisciplinary task, since\nit involves the application of physical concepts in Thermodynamics,\nHeat Transfer, Fluid Dynamics, Solid-State Physics and Magnetism.\nThe development of physically consistent models is fundamental to un-\nderstand thermo-magnetic phenomena and to compute the regeneration\n\n\n\n2.8 Active Magnetic Regenerators 37\n\nprocess in real AMRs prototypes. Mathematical models can also be ap-\nplied in the optimization of regenerators, since there are several depen-\ndent parameters that can be evaluated to achieve the best regenerator\nperformance, such as flow rate, frequency, magnetic field change and\nprofile (waveform), heat transfer fluid, regenerator geometry and mag-\nnetocaloric material. According to several modeling studies of active\nmagnetic regenerators, a complete mathematical model should include\nthe following (NIELSEN et al., 2011; TREVIZOLI et al., 2012; KITANOVSKI\net al., 2015):\n\n1. Detailed transient characteristics of the heat transfer, fluid flow\nand applied magnetic field;\n\n2. A robust numerical solver to solve the time- and space-dependent\nenergy equations, with acceptable convergence criteria;\n\n3. Appropriate functions for the temperature and magnetic field de-\npendence of the thermo-magnetic properties, such as the specific\nheat capacity and the adiabatic temperature change;\n\n4. Appropriate models for estimating longitudinal heat conduction\neffects, thermal losses to the surroundings (e.g., casing, magnets\nand surrounding air) and viscous losses;\n\n5. Flow maldistribution effects (e.g., by passing and channeling) and\ncarryover (void volume) losses;\n\n6. Appropriate models for computing magnetic losses, such as de-\nmagnetizing fields, magnetic hysteresis and eddy currents.\n\nIn general, most models published in the literature do not take into\naccount all of the above losses. Nielsen et al. (2011) and Kitanovski et\nal. (2015) carried out extensive reviews of the state of the art in AMR\nmodeling. Examples of models that are typical of the classes of models\ndeveloped in the literature are discussed next.\n\nBurdyny (2012) developed a simplified transient 1-D model based on\nthe hypothesis of thermal equilibrium between the solid and fluid phases,\nwhich is a common approach in modeling of porous media. This as-\nsumption enables the combination of the energy equations of the two\nphases into a single medium, which reduces the computational cost\n(KAVIANY, 1995). External losses due to heat leaks and losses associ-\nated with eddy currents were implemented. The model reproduced the\ntrends of the experimental data of Tura and Rowe (2011).\n\n\n\n38 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nEngelbrecht (2008) developed a transient 1-D model, in which the re-\ngenerator was modeled as a porous medium and the energy equations\nfor the fluid and solid phases were solved coupled. Engelbrecht (2008)\nused a progressive verification of the modeling approach. First, the\nmodel was used to predict the passive regenerator behavior, and was\ncompared with the Dragutinovic and Baclic (1998) solution. After,\nthe model was examined against experimental results and compared\nwith the Petersen (2007) 2-D model for parallel plates, reproducing\nthe results for temperature gradients, cooling capacity and COP. The\nagreement was better for small plate thickness (&lt;1 mm) because the\n1-D model could not directly account for temperature gradients in the\nfluid or regenerator.\n\nPetersen (2007), Nielsen (2010) and Oliveira et al. (2012) developed\ntransient 2-D models for parallel plate AMRs. Nielsen (2010) included\nin his model different losses and compared the model against exper-\nimental data with good reproducibility of the trends obtained in the\nRisoe DTU test device. The model developed by Oliveira et al. (2012)\naimed at studying the transient behavior of the oscillatory fluid flow\nand heat transfer in a parallel plate regenerator, in which an analytical\nsolution was developed for the time-dependent fluid velocity. The en-\nergy equations for the fluid and the solid plates were solved via the finite\nvolume method. The results showed that for kinetic Reynolds numbers\nabove 50, a double-peak velocity profile was observed, which resulted\nin an intensification of the heat transfer coefficient. However, this limit\ncorresponded to high operating frequencies, well above the frequencies\nencountered in AMR systems. The authors have concluded, there-\nfore, that one-dimensional models based on interstitial heat transfer\ncoefficients are sufficient for predicting the behavior of oscillating-flow\nregenerators.\n\n2.9 Design and Optimization of Thermal\nRegenerators\n\nIn a heat exchanger, there must be good thermal contact between the\nfluid and solid phases, but the latter should offer a small resistance to\nthe fluid flow. These conflicting requirements are often equalized using\nthermal optimization.\n\nThermal regenerator optimization models can be evaluated in terms of\n\n\n\n2.9 Design and Optimization of Thermal Regenerators 39\n\nseveral performance criteria. Among them, second-law based criteria\nhave been used extensively. A concise review of applications of the\nmethod in the context of heat exchangers and storage systems was\npresented by Awad and Muzychka (2012). For passive regenerators,\nseveral optimization procedures were implemented as discussed below.\n\nKrane (1987) evaluated the performance of regenerators using gases as\nworking fluids and concluded that the storage and removal processes\nneed to be analyzed together to determine the optimum characteristics\nof these devices, which were observed to be quite inefficient (i.e., 70-\n90% of the available exergy is destroyed by the end of a cycle). Das\nand Sahoo (1991) used the Entropy Generation Minimization (EGM)\nmethod in the thermodynamic optimization of regenerators under sin-\ngle blow operation. Their model disregarded the axial heat conduction\nand was valid only for low values of NTU. An optimum operating\ncondition was identified in terms of the cycle time and NTU. In a sub-\nsequent work, Das and Sahoo (1999) included the time dependence and\nthe axial conduction in the EGM analysis, thus extending the validity\nof their model to more densely packed regenerators operating at higher\nvalues of NTU.\n\nde Waele et al. (1997) and Steijaert (1999) applied the EGM method to\npulse-tube cryocoolers, taking into consideration the entropy produc-\ntion in every component (orifice, heat exchangers, regenerator, switch-\ning valves). The model was used to evaluate the thermodynamic per-\nformance of a cryocooler prototype. Based on the work of de Waele\net al. (1997), Nam and Jeong (2006) employed the EGM method in\nthe analysis of parallel-wire (segmented and unsegmented) mesh re-\ngenerators. They observed a better performance of the unsegmented\nparallel-wire configuration (in comparison to a screen mesh matrix) as\na result of lower values of porosity and friction factor. However, axial\nheat conduction was identified as the main source of irreversibility in\nthe parallel-wire case. To overcome this loss, a segmented parallel-wire\ngeometry was used to decrease the axial conduction irreversibility and\nimprove the thermodynamic performance of the parallel-wire regener-\nator.\n\nIn the context of AMR optimization, EGM analyses were conducted\nby Li et al. (2008) and Numazawa et al. (2012). Li et al. (2008) used a\nsecond-law analysis to find optimal regenerator dimensions and spheres\ndiameters for a real apparatus. They correctly related the limitations\nregarding the regenerator housing diameter with the magnet circuit\n\n\n\n40 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\nsize, where to keep the applied magnetic flux density constant and in-\ncrease the housing diameter, the size of the magnetic circuit has to\nincrease exponentially. Thus, for a fixed housing diameter, they car-\nried out an optimization of the housing aspect ratio. As a result, Li\net al. (2008) found an optimal coefficient of performance of 15.54 for a\nregenerator with an aspect ratio of 6.39 and spheres of 1.1 mm in diam-\neter. However, in the work by Li et al. (2008), the COP was proposed\nas the objective function, which did not guarantee a fixed cycle-average\nheat transfer rate at the cold source, while the housing aspect ratio and\nthe sphere size were changed. Numazawa et al. (2012) compared the\nperformances of packed beds of spheres and parallel plates as regenera-\ntive geometries changing geometrical and operating parameters (plate\nthickness, sphere diameter, aspect ratio and frequency). However, as\nthe cooling capacity was not taken as a constraint, it was difficult to\nquantify the effect of the geometric and operating parameters. There-\nfore, the combination of performance evaluation criteria (PEC) with\nthe EGM theory to optimize the performance of regenerators is an\noriginal contribution of the present thesis.\n\nIn Entropy Generation Minimization methods, the total entropy gen-\neration can be used as the Objective function in an optimization proce-\ndure based on constraints, such as the performance evaluation criteria\n(PEC) established by Webb and Kim (2005). For a single-phase flow\ncondition, a thermal device can be optimized according to fixed volume,\nfixed face area or variable geometry constraints, which may be useful\nin the context of regenerator design for both passive and active appli-\ncations. An explanation of the PEC employed in this work is presented\nas follows:\n\n? Variable Geometry (VG): this PEC enables varying the regenera-\ntor housing cross-section area and length, while keeping the total\nhousing volume constant. The VG PEC may be useful when\nthere is freedom in terms of the final aspect ratio of the regener-\nator. For a given mass (volume) of magnetocaloric material, this\nPEC can be combined with the design optimization procedure of\nthe magnet system in order to achieve an optimal configuration\nof the AMR device;\n\n? Fixed Face Area (FA): this PEC enables varying the regenerator\nhousing length, while maintaining the cross-section area constant.\nThe total mass of solid material is not constant in this PEC, since\nit changes with the housing length. In the context of magnetic\n\n\n\n2.10 Magnetic Cooling Systems 41\n\ncooling, this PEC can be useful in the optimization of the re-\ngenerator to be fitted in an existing magnet gap. In this case,\nthe regenerator length can be adjusted to satisfy a specific design\nconstraint or metric, which generally do not take into account a\nperformance assessment for the magnet, since its dimensions are\nalready fixed. Conversely, the FA PEC can also be employed\nwhen neither the size of the magnet gap nor the mass of magne-\ntocaloric material are constrained. In this case, both the magnet\nand the regenerator can be evaluated together in order to achieve\nthe optimal applied magnetic flux density volume and the amount\nof magnetic raw material that satisfy a specific operating condi-\ntion involving, say, the cooling capacity and temperature span;\n\n? Fixed Geometry (FG): in this PEC, both the regenerator housing\ncross-section area and its length are kept constant. The FG PEC\nmay be useful when the dimensions of the regenerator casing (and\nhence its total volume) cannot be changed. In a magnetic cooling\napparatus, this is the case when the magnetic circuit is already\ndesigned and built, and there is a predefined volume to place the\nregenerator. In this case, only the bed characteristics (e.g., ge-\nometry, particle size) and the flow parameters (e.g., frequency,\nflow rate) can be varied. As will be seen later in this thesis, it\nis not possible to vary the flow parameters and maintain a fixed\noperating condition (cooling capacity and temperature span) while\nenforcing the FG PEC in magnetic regenerators.\n\nIn order to achieve an optimal set of geometric parameters and oper-\nating conditions that return the minimum entropy generation in the\nregenerator, additional constraints must be established. For passive\nregenerators, this additional constraint is imposed in terms of a target\nregenerator effectiveness, which must be met by the optimal geometry\nassociated with each PEC. For active magnetic regenerators, the ad-\nditional constraint is a fixed cooling capacity for a given temperature\ndifference between the thermal reservoirs, which are the actual desired\noutput of the cooling system.\n\n2.10 Magnetic Cooling Systems\n\nThe first near-room-temperature magnetic heat pump was developed\nby Brown (1976), in which a temperature span of 47 K was achieved\n\n\n\n42 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\napplying Gd as refrigerant and a magnetic flux density of 7 T. However,\nonly after 1997, with the increasing development of magnetocaloric ma-\nterials, the research on magnetic cooling systems became more active.\nThe magnetic cooling prototypes developed so far are described in re-\nview papers (PECHARSKY; GSCHNEIDNER JR., 2006; YU et al., 2010)\nand books (KITANOVSKI et al., 2015). Kitanovski et al. (2015) pointed\nout that approximately 60 prototypes for near-room-temperature re-\nfrigeration have been developed so far. A thorough description of these\nmachines is beyond the scope of this thesis. However, as discussed\nearlier, in the AMR Brayton cycle the regenerator magnetization and\ndemagnetization processes are performed in different periods of the cy-\ncle. The application and removal of the magnetic field can be performed\nin different ways:\n\n? Reciprocating regenerator (Rec-Reg): in this configuration the\nregenerator moves back and forth into the stationary magnetic\nfield. However, as far as the regenerator is concerned, it is still\na stationary bed from the fluid flow point of view (BAHL et al.,\n2008);\n\n? Reciprocating magnet (Rec-Mag): in this configuration the re-\ngenerator is stationary and the magnet moves linearly. In gen-\neral, these prototypes operate at low frequencies (&lt;1 Hz) due\nto the high inertial forces related to the motion of the magnet\n(TREVIZOLI et al., 2011);\n\n? Rotating regenerators (Rot-Reg): in this configuration the re-\ngenerator rotates to magnetize and demagnetize the regenerator\nsynchronized with the fluid flow. These systems can operate at\nhigher frequencies but add other complexities like flow distribu-\ntion and leakages (ZIMM et al., 2006; ENGELBRECHT et al., 2012).\n\n? Rotating magnet (Rot-Mag): in this configuration the regenera-\ntor bed is stationary and the magnet rotates to perform the mag-\nnetic field variation. This simplifies the flow distribution into and\nout of the regenerator beds but the operation at higher frequen-\ncies can be a limitation due to high torques. Nevertheless, some\nrotating magnets prototypes achieved frequencies of the order of\n4 Hz (TURA; ROWE, 2011; LOZANO, 2015).\n\nTable 2.2 presents some characteristics of the main state-of-the-art\nmagnetic cooling prototypes presented in the literature, whose pho-\ntographs are shown in Fig. 2.13.\n\n\n\n2.10 Magnetic Cooling Systems 43\n\nT\na\nb\n\nle\n2\n.2\n\n\u2013\nS\n\nta\nte\n\no\nf\n\nth\ne\n\na\nrt\n\nm\na\ng\nn\n\net\nic\n\nco\no\nli\n\nn\ng\n\np\nro\n\nto\nty\n\np\nes\n\n.\n\nR\ne\nf.\n\nT\ny\np\n\ne\nM\n\na\ng\nn\n\ne\nto\n\nc\na\nlo\n\nri\nc\n\nM\na\nte\n\nri\na\nl\n\nP\ne\na\nk\n\nF\nie\n\nld\n(T\n\n)\nM\n\na\nss\n\n(k\ng\n)\n\nf\n(H\n\nz\n)\n\nM\na\nx\n.\n\nS\np\n\na\nn\n\n(K\n)\n\nO\np\n\ne\nra\n\nti\nn\n\ng\nP\n\no\nin\n\nt\n\nT\nu\n\nra\na\nn\n\nd\nR\n\no\nw\n\ne\n(2\n\n0\n1\n1\n)\n\nR\no\nt-\n\nM\na\ng\n\nG\nd\n\n1\n.4\n\n5\n0\n.1\n\n1\n4\n\n2\n9\n\n5\n0\n\nW\n(4\n\n5\n5\n\nW\n/\nk\ng\n)\n\na\nt\n\n1\n0\n\nK\n(T\n\nH\n\n=\n2\n9\n5\n\nK\n)\n\nE\nn\n\ng\ne\nlb\n\nre\nch\n\nt\ne\nt\na\nl.\n\n(2\n0\n1\n2\n)\n\nR\no\nt-\n\nR\ne\ng\n\nG\nd\n\n1\n.2\n\n4\n2\n.8\n\n0\n2\n\n2\n5\n.4\n\n2\n8\n0\n\nW\n(1\n\n0\n0\n\nW\n/\nk\ng\n)\n\na\nt\n\n1\n0\n\nK\n(T\n\nH\n\n=\n3\n0\n1\n\nK\n)\n\nJ\na\nc\no\nb\n\ns\ne\nt\na\nl.\n\n(2\n0\n1\n4\n)\n\nR\no\nt-\n\nM\na\ng\n\nL\na\nF\n\ne\nS\n\niH\n1\n.4\n\n4\n1\n.5\n\n2\n4\n\n1\n8\n\n2\n7\n0\n0\n\nW\n(1\n\n7\n7\n6\n\nW\n/\nk\ng\n)\n\na\nt\n\n1\n1\n\nK\n(T\n\nH\n=\n\n3\n1\n7\n\nK\n)\n\nA\nrn\n\no\nld\n\ne\nt\na\nl.\n\n(2\n0\n1\n4\n)\n\nR\no\nt-\n\nM\na\ng\n\nG\nd\n\n1\n.5\n\n4\n0\n.6\n\n5\n0\n.8\n\n3\n3\n\n5\n0\n\nW\n(7\n\n7\nW\n\n/\nk\ng\n)\n\na\nt\n\n1\n5\n\nK\n(T\n\nH\n=\n\n2\n9\n8\n\nK\n)\n\nE\nri\n\nk\nse\n\nn\ne\nt\na\nl.\n\n(2\n0\n1\n5\n)\n\nR\no\nt-\n\nM\na\ng\n\nG\nd\n\nY\n1\n.1\n\n1\n.7\n\n0\n.7\n\n5\n2\n0\n\n1\n0\n3\n\nW\n(6\n\n0\n.5\n\nW\n/\nk\ng\n)\n\na\nt\n\n1\n0\n\nK\n(T\n\nH\n=\n\n2\n9\n1\n\nK\n)\n\nL\no\nz\na\nn\n\no\ne\nt\na\nl.\n\n(2\n0\n1\n5\n)\n\nR\no\nt-\n\nM\na\ng\n\nG\nd\n\n1\n1\n.7\n\n0\n.8\n\n1\n2\n\n8\n0\n.4\n\nW\n(4\n\n7\n.3\n\nW\n/\nk\ng\n)\n\na\nt\n\n7\n.1\n\nK\n(T\n\nH\n=\n\n2\n9\n4\n\nK\n)\n\n\n\n44 2 Fundamentals and State of the Art of Thermal Regenerators\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\n(e)\n\nM\na\n\ng\nn\n\ne\nti\n\nc\n \n\nc\nir\n\nc\nu\n\nit\n \n\nE\nle\n\nc\ntr\n\nic\n \n\nm\no\n\nto\nr\n \n\nR\no\n\nta\nr\ny\n\n \n\nV\na\n\nlv\ne\ns \n\nR\ne\nse\n\nr\nv\n\no\nir\n\n \n\nC\no\n\nld\n H\n\ne\na\n\nt \n\nE\nx\nc\nh\n\na\nn\n\ng\ne\nr\n  \n\nC\no\n\nld\n e\n\nn\nd\n\n \n\nD\nis\n\ntr\nib\n\nu\nto\n\nr\n \n\nF\nlo\n\nw\nm\n\ne\nte\n\nr\n \n\n(f)\n\nFigure 2.13 \u2013 State-of-the-art magnetic cooling prototypes: (a) Tura\nand Rowe (2011); (b) Engelbrecht et al.

It is also the\nsimplest way to characterize the performance of active magnetic re-\ngenerators. To accomplish the objectives of the experimental research\ndescribed in this thesis, a versatile infrastructure was built to enable\nstudying passive and active magnetic regenerators in the same appara-\ntus. This way, the passive regenerator tests with non-magnetocaloric\nmaterials were performed first, and the active magnetic regenerator\nwere carried out next, using the same instrumentation and expertise\naccumulated with the passive tests. The following characteristics were\npursued in the design of the experimental apparatus:\n\n? Modularity, making it easy to maintain, assemble, disassemble\nand change the regenerator matrices;\n\n? Simplicity, facilitating the variation of the operating parameters:\nutilization, frequency, heating power (thermal load) and temper-\natures;\n\n? Robustness, particularly with respect to the instrumentation, as\ntemperature, pressure, mass flow rate, frequency and torque trans-\nducers have been installed to perform a complete characterization;\n\n? Versatility, enabling the application of different types of regener-\nators (passive and active magnetic) and pumping systems, such\nas positive displacement pumps and rotary valves.\n\nThis chapter presents the design of the experimental apparatus for test-\ning passive and active magnetic regenerators. Next, the characteristics\nof the matrices evaluated experimentally will be discussed in detail.\n\n\n\n46 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\n3.1 Description\n\nThe passive and active magnetic regenerator apparatus is a laboratory\nscale set-up, designed to operate at different experimental conditions\nwith different regenerator geometries and pumping systems. The fol-\nlowing are more specific design aspects of the setup:\n\n1. The regenerators are of the fixed-bed type;\n\n2. The oscillatory fluid flow through the fixed bed is imposed by a\ndouble effect pumping system combined with check valves;\n\n3. The change in magnetic flux density on the active magnetic re-\ngenerator is enforced by a magnetic circuit composed by nested\nrotating Halbach cylinders that allow operating frequencies up to\n1 Hz.\n\nThe apparatus is divided in two parts, namely the main section and the\nmotor section. The two parts are linked by elastic couplings to avoid\nvibration in the main section, where the principal components and\ninstrumentation are located. In the main section, the electrical com-\nponents are located at the lower level, the driving gears and pumping\nsystem are installed at the middle level and the regenerator, magnet,\ninstrumentation and heat exchangers are placed at the top level. The\nmotor section comprises the drive motor, secondary pump and torque\nmeter. Fig. 3.1 presents the main section of the designed apparatus.\n\n3.1.1 Passive Regenerator Apparatus\n\nFig. 3.2 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental passive regen-\nerator apparatus, which is composed of a stationary regenerator bed,\ntwo brazed plate heat exchangers, check valves and a pumping system\nconsisting of a double effect pump (or displacer), a crank disc and a\nstepper motor. Fig. 3.3 shows some images of the passive regenerator\ntest apparatus.\n\nDepending on the regenerator housing length and type of matrix, there\nare five to seven feed-through orifices along the regenerator to\nenable positioning of temperature probes in the matrix. The two main\ntemperature probes (used in all matrix geometries) measure the time-\ndependent temperature at the hot and cold ends of the regenerator, THE\n\n\n\n3.1 Description 47\n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Passive and active magnetic regenerators experimental\napparatus.\n\nand TCE, which are used to calculate the thermal effectiveness of the\nregenerator. The remaining temperature probes (used only in sphere\nbed regenerators) measure the time-dependent temperature inside the\nmatrix, Ti1 up to Ti5. These are used to evaluate the temperature\nprofile along the matrix and provide information about the amplitude\nof the temperature change at each position, which are useful in the\nevaluation of numerical models.\n\nThe temperatures at the hot and cold heat exchangers are controlled\nby two independent chillers (ThermoScientific - Neslab, models AC200-\nG50 and AC150-A25). The cold end was kept at a constant tempera-\nture, TC, of 280 \u00b1 0.2 K. The hot end was kept at a constant temper-\nature, TH, of 320 \u00b1 0.2 K. The ambient temperature was kept at an\nintermediate temperature of 300 \u00b1 2 K to balance the heat gain and\nheat loss at the regenerator cold and hot sides, respectively.\n\n\n\n48 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\nC\no\n\nld\nM\n\nF\nM\n\nP\n\nT\nT\n\nT\nT\n\nT\nT\n\nT\n\nP T\n\nT T\n\nH\no\n\nt\nM\n\nF\nM\n\nP\nT P T\n\nT T\n\nC\nO\n\nL\nD\n\n \nB\n\nA\nT\n\nH\n\nP\nA\n\nS\nS\n\nIV\nE\n\n R\nE\n\nG\nE\n\nN\nE\n\nR\nA\n\nT\nO\n\nR\n\nC\nH\n\nE\nC\n\nK\n V\n\nA\nL\nV\n\nE\n\nH\nO\n\nT\nB\n\nA\nT\n\nH\n\nC\nH\n\nE\nC\n\nK\n V\n\nA\nL\nV\n\nE\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n\nP\nP\n\nR\nE\n\nS\nS\n\nU\nR\n\nIZ\nE\n\nD\nW\n\nA\nT\n\nE\nR\n\nR\nE\n\nS\nE\n\nR\nV\n\nO\nIR\n\nD\nO\n\nU\nB\n\nL\nE\n\n E\nF\n\nF\nE\n\nC\nT\n\n \nP\n\nU\nM\n\nP\nL\n\nIN\nE\n\nA\nR\n\n P\nO\n\nT.\nB\n\nE\nV\n\nE\nL\n\n \nG\n\nE\nA\n\nR\n B\n\nO\nX\n\nCOLD  HEAT \nEXCHANGER\n\nHOT  HEAT \nEXCHANGER\n\nTT C\nE\n\nT\ni5\n\nT\ni4\n\nT\ni3\n\nT\ni2\n\nT\nH\n\nE\nT\n\ni1\n\nP\nC\n\n-i\nn\n\nP\nC\n\n-o\nu\n\nt\n\nP\nH\n\n-i\nn P\nH\n\n-o\nu\n\nt\n\nC\no\n\nld\n S\n\nid\ne\n\nH\no\n\nt \nS\n\nid\ne\n\nT\nC\n\nH\n-o\n\nu\nt\n\nT\nC\n\nH\n-i\n\nnT\nC\n\nR\n-i\n\nn\n\nT\nC\n\nR\n-o\n\nu\nt\n\nT\nH\n\nR\n-o\n\nu\nt T\n\nH\nH\n\n-i\nn\n\nT\nH\n\nR\n-i\n\nn T\nH\n\nH\n-o\n\nu\nt\n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Schematic diagram of the experimental passive regenerator\napparatus.\n\n\n\n3.1 Description 49\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Passive regenerator test apparatus: (a) Frontal view show-\ning the pumping system, gear boxes, check valves and mass flow meters;\n(b) Top view showing the regenerator housing, heat exchangers, tem-\nperature probes and pressure transducers.\n\n\n\n50 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\nThe pumping system delivers an oscillatory flow to the regenerator,\nwhereby the flow velocity can be adjusted through the piston stroke\n(altering the crank disc position) and the frequency (changing the an-\ngular velocity of the motor). Check valves are used to guarantee unidi-\nrectional flow in the heat exchangers. The tests were performed using\nwater as heat transfer fluid. Table 3.1 presents a summary of the con-\nditions of the passive regenerator tests.\n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Passive regenerator test conditions.\n\nVariable Value or range Units\n\nTH 320 K\nTC 280 K\n\n?Tspan 40 K\nTamb 300 K\nf 0.25 - 2 Hz\n? 0.1 - 1.4 -\n\nFluid Distilled water -\n\nThe passive regenerator cycle starts with the hot blow, where the dou-\nble effect pump driven by the stepper motor delivers a constant volume\nof fluid for a given period. The fluid passes through the mass flow\nmeter (Hot MFM) and enters the hot heat exchanger where it is re-\nconditioned to TH. Then, the fluid exits the hot reservoir and enters\nthe matrix at 320 K, after passing by the pressure transducer (PH-in).\nInside the regenerator, the end and internal temperatures are read, and\nthe fluid exits the matrix returning to the pump, passing by the pres-\nsure transducer (PC-out). Therefore, the effectiveness of the hot blow is\ncalculated based on the time-dependent temperature of the fluid exit-\ning the cold end, TCE, and the pressure drop is the difference between\nPC-out and PH-in.\n\nIn the remaining period of the cycle, the cold blow, the same volume\nof fluid is pumped back. The fluid passes through the mass flow meter\n(Cold MFM) and enters the cold heat exchanger, where it is recondi-\ntioned to TC. Then, the fluid exits the cold reservoir and enters the\nmatrix at 280 K, after passing by the pressure transducer (PC-in). After\nflowing through the regenerator, the fluid exits the matrix returning to\nthe pump, after flowing by the pressure transducer (PH-out). Hence, the\neffectiveness of the cold blow is calculated based on the time-dependent\ntemperature of the fluid exiting the hot end, THE, and the pressure drop\nis the difference between PH-out and PC-in.\n\n\n\n3.1 Description 51\n\n3.1.2 Active Magnetic Regenerator Apparatus\n\nFig. 3.4 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental active mag-\nnetic regenerator apparatus, which is composed by the same elements\nof the passive assembly plus the magnetic circuit and the electrical\nheater. The magnetic circuit is made up of two concentric (nested)\nHalbach cylinders. This configuration enables changing the applied\nmagnetic flux density as the cylinders are rotated. The regenerator is\nplaced in the magnetic gap, i.e., along the centerline of the internal\nhollow cylinder. A more detailed description of the magnetic circuit\nis presented in the following sections. The 100-mm long, 9.2-? electri-\ncal heater was assembled inside a 22.22-mm diameter fiberglass epoxy\n(G10) tube. In the AMR apparatus, there were no temperature probes\npositioned along the matrix. Fig. 3.5 shows some images of the mag-\nnetic active regenerator test apparatus.\n\nThe temperatures at the hot and cold heat exchangers are controlled\nby the same thermal baths used in the passive regenerator apparatus.\nThe temperatures in both thermal reservoirs can be adjusted according\nto the experimental test condition. The fluid pumping system is also\nthe same. Table 3.2 presents a summary of the experimental conditions\nin the AMR tests.\n\nTable 3.2 \u2013 Active magentic regenerator test conditions.\n\nVariable Value or range Units\n\nTH 290 to 315 K\nTC varies according to the tests K\n\n?THex varies according to the tests K\nCooling Capacity varies according to the tests W\n\nTAmb 293 and 300 K\nf 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 Hz\n? 0.16 - 3 -\n\nFluid Distilled water 80% - ethylene glycol 20% -\n\nThe AMR cycle is divided in two stages, namely the hot period and the\ncold period. The hot period starts with the magnetization process and,\nas the magnetic flux density in the regenerator changes, the cold blow\nis performed. As the fluid enters the matrix at TC, heat is removed\nfrom the regenerator bed and the fluid leaves the regenerator at TH to\nreject heat in the hot reservoir. As can be seen in Figs. 3.2 and 3.4, the\napparatus was designed so that there is unidirectional flow through the\nhot and cold heat exchangers.

The cold blow mass flow rate is\nmeasured by the Cold MFM (mass flow meter) and the pressure drop\nis taken as the difference between PH-out and PC-in.\n\nDuring the cold period, the demagnetization process is performed as\nthe fluid enters the matrix at TH (hot blow), cools down as heat is\ntransferred to the porous medium, and exits the regenerator at a tem-\nperature below TC. The hot blow outlet temperature is represented\nby its time-average, T CE. Then, the fluid returns to the double effect\npump and is pumped back to the regenerator through the Cold MFM.\nThe fluid then flows through the cold heat exchanger and electrical\nheater, before returning to the regenerator. Note that in the hot blow\nthe mass flow rate is measured by the Hot MFM and the pressure drop\nis taken as the difference between PC-out and PH-in.\n\nThe thermal load is imposed by the electrical heater on the cold side.\nThe temperature of the fluid entering the heater, THeater-in, is set equal\nto the time-average temperature of the fluid that exits the regenerator\nat the cold end during the hot blow, T CE. This is accomplished by the\ncold heat exchanger, which eliminates any heat gained along tubing and\nother elements on the cold side, including the instrumentation. Thus,\nthere are two temperature probes to measure the heater inlet temper-\nature (or the cold heat exchanger outlet temperature), TCH-out and\nTHeater-in. The heater outlet temperature, THeater-out, is also measured.\nFor practical purposes, this is taken as the cold reservoir temperature,\ni.e., TC = THeater-out.\n\nThe cooling capacity is calculated based on the temperature difference\nbetween the regenerator inlet (cold blow) and outlet (hot blow) tem-\nperatures at the cold end, ?TCE = TC ?T CE. A heat balance on the\nelectrical heater can be used to check this calculation, where the heater\ntemperature difference is given by ?Theater = TC ? THeater-in. The\ncooling capacity calculation procedure will be explained in more detail\nin the AMR results chapter, together with some discussions about the\nuncertainties associated with the procedure.\n\n\n\n3.2 Sub-systems of the Apparatus 55\n\n3.2 Sub-systems of the Apparatus\n\n3.2.1 Magnetic Circuit\n\nNested Halbach cylinders (NHC) were used recently in several AMR\napparatuses (TURA; ROWE, 2011; ARNOLD et al., 2014). The NHC con-\nfiguration shown in Fig. 3.6 consists of two concentric Halbach cylin-\nders so that each magnet array generates a magnetic field in its core.\nIf the magnetic field contributions of each magnet are added, then the\nmaximum magnetic flux density, ~Bmax, of the NHC is observed at the\ncore of the inner magnet, as shown in Fig. 3.6(a). Conversely, when\nthe magnetic field contributions are subtracted, the minimum mag-\nnetic flux density, ~Bmin, is obtained, as seen in Fig. 3.6(b). Thus, it\nfollows that the NHC configuration is an alternating magnetic field\nsource. By creating a relative motion between the cylinders, the mag-\nnetic field changes continuously between the maximum and the mini-\nmum flux density positions (COEY, 2002; BJ\u00d8RK et al., 2010d; TURA;\nROWE, 2011).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Nested Halbach cylinders: (a) At the maximum magnetic\nfield position; (b) At the minimum magnetic field position. The black\narrows indicate the remanent flux density of the permanent magnet\nsegments, while the red arrows indicate ~B in the magnetic gap.\n\nThe NHC configuration was chosen as the magnetic field source for the\npresent AMR test apparatus for the following reasons:\n\n1. It can generate high magnetic flux densities of the order of 1.5 T;\n\n\n\n56 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\n2. It is compact and a reasonable mass of magnetocaloric material\ncan be contained in the high magnetic field change region;\n\n3. It can be easily assembled with a simple structure;\n\n4. It creates a variable field simply by rotating the cylinders, thus\nenabling operating frequencies as high as 4 Hz (TURA; ROWE,\n2011).\n\nOn the other hand, some drawbacks of NHCs can be listed as follows:\n\n1. Only a single regenerator can be housed per core. Thus, for con-\ntinuous cyclic operation, at least two NHCs are required;\n\n2. Oscillating torques can be developed due to segmented magnets\n(ARNOLD et al., 2014; MHI?OCHA?IN et al., 1999);\n\n3. Asymmetric magnetic field waveforms can be generated, which\nreduce the AMR performance by making the low field period\nshorter than the high field (TURA; ROWE, 2011; ARNOLD et al.,\n2014; TREVIZOLI et al., 2014);\n\n4. A significant amount of permanent magnet raw material\n(Nd2Fe14B) is usually required to build NHCs, which leads to\nhigh unit costs.\n\nTypically, NHC arrays have low values of the figure of merit ?cool when\ncompared with other magnetic circuits (BJ\u00d8RK et al., 2010c)1. However,\nthe ability to change the magnetic field at high frequencies with low\ninertial effects makes this configuration close to ideal for the present\napparatus design. One of the main challenges of using NHC arrays as\nthe variable magnetic field source in AMR test devices is the design of\nthe motion system. Appropriate selection of components, such as gear\nboxes, pulleys, belts, driver and shaft couplings is crucial for achieving\nfrequencies of the order of 1 Hz with low noise and small mechanical\nlosses.\n\n1?cool can be used to quantify the potential of a magnetic circuit for magnetic\nrefrigeration applications. An ideal magnet for an AMR prototype, with a high value\nof ?cool, should guarantee a large magnetic field variation (high magnetocaloric\neffect), a large volume of generated magnetic field (larger density of magnetocaloric\nmaterial), must be used during most of the cycle time (ideally in a continuous cycle)\nand, equally important, use a small amount of permanent magnet (to reduce cost).\n\n\n\n3.2 Sub-systems of the Apparatus 57\n\nRotating a single magnet or counter rotating the two magnets dictates\nhow the magnetic field will change in the core of the NHC array, as\nillustrated in Fig. 3.7. Rotating the internal magnet (I) with a static\nexternal magnet (E), Fig. 3.7(a), results in the simplest and most com-\npact magnet motion configuration, since the external magnet is usually\nthe heaviest piece (TURA; ROWE, 2011). As illustrated in Fig. 3.7(a),\nrotating the inner array causes both the magnitude (modulus) and the\norientation (direction) of the magnetic flux density vector to change\n\ncontinuously. At position [(E) at 0?; (I) at 0?], ~B is maximum with a\ndownward direction, while at position [(E) at 0?; (I) at 45? or 135?],\n\nthe modulus of ~B is smaller with the orientation always in phase with\nthe angle of the inner array. The minimum field is observed at posi-\ntion [(E) at 0?; (I) at 180?]. The change in direction of ~B gives rise\nto a external magnetic force acting on the magnetocaloric regenerator\npositioned in the magnet core. This magnetic force tends to rotate the\nregenerator with the magnet, generating structural problems which are\nmore serious when the regenerator matrix is composed by thin paral-\nlel plates or pins. Additionally, a rotating magnetic field direction in\nthe magnetic gap increases the complexity of evaluating demagnetizing\nlosses in AMRs (BAHL; NIELSEN, 2009; TREVIZOLI et al., 2012).\n\nCounter rotating the internal and external magnets, Fig. 3.7(b), re-\nquires a more complex magnet motion system. However, as the Hal-\nbach cylinders counter rotate, the modulus of ~B changes continuously,\nbut the orientation is kept fixed. In Fig. 3.7(b), at position [(E) at 0?;\n\n(I) at 0?], ~B is maximum and points downward, while at position [(E)\n\nat -45?; (I) at 45?], the magnitude of ~B has decreased, maintaining\n\nthe same direction. At position [(E) at -90?; (I) at 90?], ~B is mini-\n\nmum. Further counter rotation inverts the direction of ~B. At position\n[(E) at -135?; (I) at 135?], the magnitude of ~B is larger, but it points\nupward. The maximum modulus is reached again at position [(E) at\n-180?; (I) at 180?], this time with an upward direction. For the counter\nrotating configuration, the frequency is twice that of the single magnet\nconfiguration.\n\nThe design of the NHC array built in this thesis was based on an\nanalytical method to find the optimal NHC dimensions that guarantee\nhigh magnetic flux densities at the highest possible ?cool. The pro-\nposed method was validated with numerical simulations using COM-\nSOL Multiphysics 3D and experimental measurements of the magnetic\nflux density in the magnet array (TREVIZOLI et al., 2015). The NHC de-\n\n\n\n58 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013 Illustration of the NHC magnetic field variation: (a) Rota-\ntion of the internal magnet with a static external magnet; (b) Counter\nrotation of the internal and external magnets.

Sintered\nNd2Fe14B (BAKKER-MAGNETICS, 2014) was the magnet raw material\nused to manufacture the Halbach cylinders. To avoid the magnetiza-\ntion reversal effect (BLOCH et al., 1998; BJ\u00d8RK et al., 2008), the N50M\nand N42UH magnet grades were used in the outer and inner cylinders,\nrespectively.

Despite the more\n\n\n\n3.2 Sub-systems of the Apparatus 59\n\ncomplex bearing structure and motion system, the counter rotating\nconfiguration was preferred since one of the objectives of the AMR test\napparatus is to evaluate experimentally regenerative geometries, such\nas parallel plates and staggered arrays of pins. Hence, a fixed direction\nof the magnetic flux density vector guarantees structural stability of the\nregenerator geometry.

The solid lines represent\nthe measurement stations inside the NHC array where the regenerator\nis located (?50 ? z ? 50 mm). The dotted lines correspond to stations\noutside the regenerator region surrounded by the bearing structure (see\nFig. 3.9). This means that the NHC array has a maximum magnetic\nflux density (at 0 and 180?) of 1.69 T and a minimum flux density (at\n90? and 270?) of about 0.04 T.\n\nRotating angle [deg]\n\nR\ne\n\ns\nu\n\nlt\na\n\nn\nt \n\n- \nM\n\na\ng\n\nn\ne\n\nti\nc\n\n F\nlu\n\nx\n D\n\ne\nn\n\ns\nit\n\ny\n [\n\nT\n]\n\n0 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 360\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\nz0\nz7.5mm\nz17.5mm\nz27.5mm\nz37.5mm\nz47.5mm\nz57.5mm\nz65mm\nz77.5mm\nz97.5mm\nz117.5mm\nz137.5mm\n\nFigure 3.10 \u2013 Experimental resultant magnetic flux density measure-\nments at different positions along the z axis as a function of the rotating\nangle of the inner magnet.\n\nFig. 3.11 shows the axial profiles of the maximum magnetic flux density\ncomponents (x and y) and the resultant and the vector direction (?).\nThe dark gray region represents the external and internal cylinder ar-\nrays, and the light gray region the stainless steel support structure.

The double effect pump was chosen as it presents the\nfollowing advantages:\n\n1. It can perform the cold and hot blows by simply rotating the\ncrank disc and using only unidirectional check vales (Fig. 3.13(b));\n\n2. For a given stroke adjusted in the crank disc, the volume of fluid\n\n\n\n3.2 Sub-systems of the Apparatus 63\n\npumped per cycle is fixed. The mass flow rate (and hence the flow\nvelocity) is adjusted simply by changing the operating frequency.\nThis allows keeping a constant utilization factor while changing\nthe mass flow rate (and hence the NTU), as was done to generate\nthe ideal regenerator results presented in Fig. 2.3;\n\n3. The pumping system is driven directly by the motor, which also\ndrives the magnetic circuit. Thus, a single motor can be used,\nenabling an easier synchronization between the magnetic and fluid\nflow cycles. This also simplifies the analysis of the performance\nmetrics, since the total motor work can be measured directly.\n\n4. It is compact and easy to assemble, service and maintain.\n\nNevertheless, in terms of performance, the main disadvantage of dou-\nble effect pumps is that they provide sinusoidal fluid flow waveforms,\nwith a peak in flow velocity in the middle of the blow. As a conse-\nquence, peaks in pressure drop and pumping power are also observed.\nFor instance, if the flow profile is perfectly sinusoidal with an average\npressure drop of 100 kPa (1.0 bar), the peak pressure drop is about 157\nkPa (?/2 \u00d7 100 kPa), which can offer some restrictions to operating\ncondition at high mass flow rates. As presented in Fig. 3.13(a) and in\nTable 3.4, three different pump sizes were used to cover a broad range\nof pumping volumes (and utilization factors). Table 3.4 also shows the\npump dimensions and displaced volume as a function of the stroke that\nis adjusted at the crank disc, as presented in Fig. 3.13(c). Finally, the\ntime-average ( \u00af?m) mass flow rate per blow is calculated by:\n\nm? = ?f?\nsk\n4\n\n(D2cyl ?D\n2\nshf) (3.1)\n\nwhere ? = 2?f is the angular frequency, sk is the piston stroke, Dcyl\nis the pump cylinder diameter and Dshf is the shaft diameter.\n\nTable 3.4 \u2013 Displaced volume (Vpump) [cm\n3] used in the experiments.\n\nPump\nDiameter [mm] Stroke (sk) [mm]\n\nCylinder Shaft 10 15 20 25 30\n\nPP42.5 19.05 6.35 2.53 3.80 5.07 6.33 -\nPP92.5 27.00 7.92 5.23 7.84 10.45 13.07 -\nPP122.5 31.75 11.10 6.95 10.42 13.90 17.37 20.85\n\n\n\n64 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\n(a)\n\n(b) (c)\n\nFigure 3.13 \u2013 Pumping system: (a) Double effect pumps; (b) Check\nvalves; (c) Crank disc.\n\n3.2.3 Transmission System\n\nFig. 3.14(a) shows the NHC and pumping motion system. A stepper\nmotor (Kalatec Nema 34, model KML-HT34-487) coupled to a 15:1 re-\nduction gearbox is employed to achieve high torques. The stepper mo-\ntor is controlled by a driver (Applied Motion model ST10), which guar-\nantees precise operating speed and frequency. The torque transducer is\nassembled between the reduction and the spiral bevel gearboxes. The\nspiral bevel gearbox (Tandler STD00-EA-III, 1:1) was found to be a\nsuitable and compact solution to counter rotate the magnets, where\nthe torque imposed by the stepper motor is transmitted by the bevel\ngears into two independent shafts that rotate in opposite directions.\nTwo sets of pulleys and belts are used to connect the spiral bevel gear-\nbox and the magnets.\n\n\n\n3.2 Sub-systems of the Apparatus 65\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.14 \u2013 Transmission system to counter rotate the NHC while\nkeeping the phasing with the pumping system: (a) Overall design; (b)\nTransmission relations between the shafts.\n\n\n\n66 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\nA second spiral bevel gearbox (Tandler STD00-III, 1:2) was used to\ndrive the double effect displacer. This gearbox was selected with a\ntransmission relation of 1:2 to guarantee the phasing with the NHC\nsince, for counter rotating magnets, the relation between the magnetic\ncircuit and the motor driving shaft is 2:1. Thus, for a perfect synchro-\nnization, the pump also must have a relation of 2:1 with the driving\nshaft (two hot and two cold blows). Fig. 3.14(b) shows the transmission\nrelations between all shafts of the system.\n\n3.2.4 Magnetic and Fluid Flow Synchronization\n\nFig. 3.15 presents the magnetic and fluid flow waveforms of the AMR\napparatus. The hot cycle takes place between 0 and 180o, during which\nthe magnetic flux density increases from approximately 70% of its max-\nimum at zero flow to 100% at a maximum flow velocity at 90o. Then,\nthe magnetic flux density decreases to approximately 70% again and the\nflow reverses. In the remaining period, i.e., the cold cycle, the magnetic\nflux density reaches a minimum when the hot blow velocity reaches a\nmaximum in the reverse direction. It is worth noting that the magnetic\nflux density waveform is a rectified sinusoidal profile, with a sharp min-\nimum at around 270o. As shown in Trevizoli et al. (2013a, 2014), this\nresults in a very short period of time at the minimum magnetic flux den-\nsity, which has a negative impact on the performance of the magnetic\ncycle in comparison with the perfect sinusoidal and square waveforms.\n\n3.3 Passive Regenerators Matrices\n\nThe passive regenerators matrices were built using different bed geome-\ntries to enable a comprehensive performance evaluation (e.g., losses)\nand model validation. The following matrix geometries were evalu-\nated: packed beds of spheres, pin arrays and parallel plates. The\nresulting variety of geometric parameters, from porous media length\nscales to housing dimensions, are important to verify the sensitivity\nand generality of the experimental and numerical results. Addition-\nally, the comparisons between different porous media matrices enabled\nanalyzing the potential of each geometry in terms of their thermal per-\nformances and associated losses. All matrices used in the passive heat\ntransfer analysis in this thesis were made from stainless steel AISI-304.\n\n\n\n3.3 Passive Regenerators Matrices 67\n\nRotating angle or dimensionless time [deg]\n\nD\nim\n\ne\nn\n\ns\nio\n\nn\nle\n\ns\ns\n\n P\na\n\nra\nm\n\ne\nte\n\nr \n[-\n\n]\n\n0 90 180 270 360\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1  Magnetic Flux Density Waveform\n Flow velocity Waveform\n\nFigure 3.15 \u2013 Magnetic and fluid flow waveforms synchronization.\n\nIn the sphere packed bed regenerators, three different spherical par-\nticles and four different regenerator housing (casing) geometries were\nused. As will be seen, three casings have the same cross sectional area,\nAc,Reg, and different lengths, LReg, while two share the same length but\nhave different cross sectional areas. The porosity, ?, was approximately\nconstant in all matrices. This allows a more precise performance com-\nparison for different values of flow rate, superficial velocity and utiliza-\ntion, which is crucial for evaluating the sensitivity of the experimental\napparatus, validating the numerical model and optimizing performance\nfor a specified operating condition.\n\nThe void volume is another important parameter for evaluating the per-\nformance of regenerative matrices, especially when the total volume of\nthe matrix is varied. As mentioned before, the void volume is defined as\nthe volume of fluid between each regenerator end and its corresponding\nheat exchanger that changes direction outside the regenerator, without\ninteracting thermally with it. The void volume fraction, ??, is defined\nas the ratio between the total void volume, ?, and the fluid volume in\n\n\n\n68 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\nthe regenerator, ?Ac,RegLReg:\n\n?? =\n?\n\n?Ac,RegLReg\n(3.2)\n\nTo study the impact of the void volume on the thermal performance\nof passive regenerators, different regenerator-to-tube adapters (R-T\nadapters) were designed and fabricated with different void volume sizes,\nwhich can be combined with the different housing volumes to result in\ndifferent values of ?? for each case. The void volume size is approxi-\nmately the internal volume of the R-T adapters.\n\nRegarding the different bed geometries, the spheres, pins and plates\nwere selected and/or fabricated to maintain approximately the same\nparticle diameter. In porous media, the particle diameter is the ratio\nof the surface (interstitial heat transfer) area and the volume of the\nregenerator. Thus, for bed geometries with the same particle diameter\nand approximately the same porosity, the heat transfer surface area\nis approximately the same. As a result, by fixing the mass flow rate\n(constant utilization and frequency), housing cross sectional area and\nvoid volume fraction, what differentiates the surfaces with respect to\ntheir thermal performance are the magnitude of the interstitial heat\ntransfer coefficient and the thermal losses, especially the axial heat\nconduction (since in passive regenerators the heat exchange with the\nambient is negligible).\n\n3.3.1 Packed Beds of Spheres\n\nThe packed bed matrices were composed by stainless steel spheres with\nparticle diameters, dp, of 0.5 mm, 0.8 mm and 1 mm, as shown in\nFig. 3.16. The regenerator casings are presented in Fig. 3.17. Cas-\nings #1, #2 and #3 have the same cross sectional area but different\nlengths. Casings #3 and #4 have the same length but different cross\nsectional areas. Table 3.5 presents the dimensions and porosities as-\nsociated with each matrix, where Dh,Reg is the regenerator housing\nhydraulic diameter and ?Reg = LReg/Dh,Reg is the regenerator aspect\nratio. The housing for the packed bed regenerators were made from\nacetal resin (POM). The R-T adapter #1 was used in the tests pre-\nsented in this section for Casings #1, #2 and #3. For Casing #4\na specific R-T adapter was designed because of the smaller diameter\n\n\n\n3.3 Passive Regenerators Matrices 69\n\nof this casing, as presented in Table 3.5. The different void volume\nfractions are also presented in Table 3.5.\n\nThe dimensional measurement uncertainties associated with the diam-\neters and lengths were taken as the design tolerances used to machine\nthe casings. The porosity was calculated using the casing volume and\nthe total mass of the spheres, whose uncertainties involve the dimen-\nsional tolerance and the scale uncertainty. The maximum calculated\nuncertainty of the porosity was about \u00b1 0.005. More details about the\npacked bed regenerator assembly can be found in Appendix B.\n\nTable 3.5 \u2013 Packed bed of spheres passive regenerators.\n\nCasing\nDimensions Porosity \u00b1 0.005 [-]\n\n??

Thus, different R-\nT adapters were fabricated in order to achieve a void volume fraction\nof about 7.5% in the regenerators with the same diameter and different\nlengths, as presented in the secondary diagonal of Table 3.6 and in\nFig. 3.18.\n\nTable 3.6 \u2013 Void volume fractions for different casings and sizes of R-T\nadapters.\n\nCasing\ndp 1 mm ?\n\n?\n\nPorosity R-T Adapter #1 R-T Adapter #2 R-T Adapter #3\n\n#1 0.364 14.50% 9.67% 7.25%\n#2 0.364 11.20% 7.44% 5.58%\n#3 0.363 7.66% 5.10% 3.82%\n\n\n\n3.3 Passive Regenerators Matrices 71\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.18 \u2013 R-T adapters: (a) Design details; (b) Built R-T adapters.\n\nIn theory, eliminating the void volumes improves the regenerator ther-\nmal performance, as these are directly related to the leakage losses\n(SHAH; SEKULIC?, 2003). In order to systematically evaluate the impact\nof the void volumes on the performance of the passive regenerators de-\nveloped here, the void volumes were decreased by reducing the diverg-\ning section of the R-T adapters. However, this reduction of the cross\nsectional area is known to increase the importance of two-dimensional\nflow entrance effects (i.e., mixing) inside the regenerator matrix, which\ncan impact negatively on the regenerator effectiveness. Therefore, for\na fixed regenerator geometry, changing the R-T adapter enables quan-\ntifying the balance between the impact of the void volume and the\nentrance effects on the thermal performance. Additionally, a zero void\nvolume regenerator (Casing #7) was built based on the AMR geometry\nproposed by Lozano (2015). The zero void volume housing of Lozano\n(2015), presented in Fig. 3.19, had a round rectangular cross sectional\narea, with the flow streams entering and exiting the regenerator by the\nparallel ports on each side, flowing diagonally through the matrix. The\n\n\n\n72 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\nregenerator dimensions for Casing #7 are shown in Table 3.7, where\nWReg and HReg are the cross-section width and height, respectively.\nTwo different spheres sizes were evaluated in this regenerator, namely\n0.5 and 1 mm.\n\nTable 3.7 \u2013 Casing #7 - zero void volume regenerator design.\n\nCasing\nDimensions Porosity \u00b1 0.005 [-]\n\n??\nWReg\n[mm]\n\nHReg\n[mm]\n\nLReg\n[mm]\n\n?Reg\n[-]\n\ndp 0.5\nmm\n\ndp 1\nmm\n\n#7 27.85 10 80 5.44 0.373 0.365 -\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.19 \u2013 Casing #7 - Zero void volume regenerator design: (a)\nIsometric view detailing the entrance and exiting passages; (b) Top\nview of the rectangular cross sectional area.\n\n3.3.3 Parallel Plates and Pin Arrays\n\nThe parallel plate and staggered square pin array regenerators were\nmachined by wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM). The me-\nchanical design of the matrices took into account limitations such as\nthe minimum wire diameter (0.14 mm) and maximum wire length (25\nmm) (EDM-TECHNOLOGIES, 2013). A 1-mm thick base plate was used\nin the present design to guarantee the structural stability of the matrix.\n\nBased on the above fabrication limitations and to guarantee an inter-\nstitial area equivalent to that of the 0.8-mm packed sphere regenerator,\nthe pins and plates were designed to yield equivalent particle diameters\nand porosities of around 0.8 mm and 36%, respectively. This resulted\nin plates with a thickness of 0.25 mm and square pins with 0.53-mm\n\n\n\n3.3 Passive Regenerators Matrices 73\n\nsides. Fig. 3.20 shows single pieces of a WEDM parallel plate and a\nsquare pin array matrix. For simplicity, the pin array and plate ma-\ntrices have a square cross sectional area, while the cross section areas\nof the packed sphere matrices are round. The final regenerators were\ndesigned to have approximately the same cross sectional area and the\nsame total matrix mass/volume. Therefore, given values of fluid flow\nrate and frequency will result in approximately the same utilization\nfactor and fluid superficial velocity. Consequently, any differences in\nNTU or performance between the matrices can be regarded as due to\ndifferences in heat transfer coefficient and thermal losses. Table 3.8\nshows the geometric characteristics of the matrices, where eg denotes\nthe thickness of the solid piece (plate or pin) and ech is the thickness\nof the flow channel or passage.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 3.20 \u2013 Parallel plate and square pin arrays: (a) Detail of square\npins; (b) Detail of parallel plates; (c) Scale of the pin array piece; (d)\nScale of the parallel plate piece.\n\n\n\n74 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\nTable 3.8 \u2013 Characteristics of the passive regenerators.\n\nMatrix\nGeometry [mm]\n\n?

The challenge in this assembly was to avoid obstructing\nthe flow passages, as shown in Fig. 3.21(a). Next, the final matrix was\ninserted in a 3D-printed digital ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene)\nhousing, shown in Figs. 3.21(b) and (c). The matrices were kept fixed\nto the housing by epoxy resin to avoid flow channeling. Finally, the\nABS housing was inserted into a G10 fiberglass resin casing to improve\nthe mechanical resistance, as shown in Fig. 3.21(d). The mounting of\nthe ABS piece into the G10 casing was designed with a tight tolerance\nto prevent external leakages. More details regarding the pin array and\nplate regenerators are presented in Appendix B.\n\nNew R-T adapters with a square sectional area were designed to mini-\nmize flow maldistributions in the parallel plate and pin array matrices.\nThe void volume sizes of these adapters are the same as those made\nfor Casing #4 (packed spheres). The square R-T adapters, shown in\nFig. 3.22, were also 3D printed in digital ABS.\n\n3.4 AMR Matrices\n\nThe AMR matrices were also built in the three different porous media\ngeometries, i.e., packed beds of spheres, parallel plates and pin arrays.\nAlso, as will be seen, the regenerator housing dimensions were kept\nconstant. All the AMR matrices were made from commercial-grade\ngadolinium (Gd).\n\nThe first AMR matrix assembled and evaluated in this thesis (for this\nreason referred to as the Reference AMR) consists of a packed bed\nof Gd spheres with diameters in the range 0.5 ? dp ? 0.6 mm (0.55\nmm average). The dimensions of the Reference AMR casing are 22.22\nmm (ID of the G10 casing) and 100 mm (casing length), which are\n\n\n\n3.4 AMR Matrices 75\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 3.21 \u2013 Parallel plate and pin array regenerators: (a) Combi-\nnation of the five pieces into a 100-mm long matrix; (b) Digital ABS\nhousing; (c) Assembling the matrix in the ABS housing; (d) ABS hous-\ning inside the G10 casing.\n\nFigure 3.22 \u2013 R-T adapters for the parallel plate and pin array matrices.\n\n\n\n76 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\nthe maximum housing dimensions that fit in the magnetic gap of the\nHalbach array.\n\nOther AMR regenerators were built with the same dimensions of the\npassive regenerator matrices shown in Table 3.8. The housings and\nR-T adapters were also identical in their geometry and materials. The\nonly slight difference between the passive and active regenerators lies\nin the sphere diameter range of the Gd packed bed regenerator. The\nGd spheres were supplied with diameters in the range 0.71 ? dp ? 0.85\nmm (0.78 mm average). Therefore, by evaluating the performances of\nthe passive regenerators in the light of their thermal effectiveness, axial\nheat conduction and viscous losses, it will be possible to draw some\nconclusions about these losses in the AMR geometries and understand\nthe impact of losses occurring only in active regenerators, i.e., the mag-\nnetic losses.

The heat\ninteractions between the regenerator and the surroundings have to be\ncarefully considered when comparing experimental data and numerical\nresults. A trustworthy comparison between numerical and experimental\nregenerator results can be performed in only two ways: (i) by making a\ngood thermal insulation; (ii) by implementing a comprehensive model\nfor the heat transfer with the surroundings.\n\nIn the passive regenerator experiments, the POM casings were designed\nwith a minimum wall thickness of 11 mm. Additionally, there is enough\nspace around the regenerator housing to put the thermal insulation, as\ncan be seen in Fig. 3.23, where the red arrows indicate the steps of\nthe insulation procedure. The ambient temperature was kept at 300\n\n\n\n3.5 Thermal Insulation 77\n\nK during all experiments, as this is the average temperature between\nthe reservoirs (i.e., 280 K at the cold and 320 K at the hot heat ex-\nchangers, respectively). All passive regenerator experimental tests were\nconducted at this condition so as to compensate the heat gained from\nand lost to the surroundings.\n\nFigure 3.23 \u2013 Steps of the application of the thermal insulation on the\npassive regenerators.\n\n\n\n78 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\nOn the other hand, in the AMR regenerators there is not sufficient space\nto put a good thermal insulation around the regenerator. Thus, there\nis a trade-off between how big the housing thickness can be and the\ntotal mass of magnetocaloric material to be placed in the regenerator.\nHowever, a thermal insulation as effective as the one used in the passive\nexperiments is not possible. Fig. 3.24 shows cross-section views of the\ntwo types of AMRs inside the magnet gap. In Fig. 3.24(a), the Spheres\n#3 regenerator, the thermal insulation is performed only by the G10\ncasing. Conversely, in the parallel plate and pin array regenerators\nshown in Fig. 3.24(b) (Plates #5 and Pins #6), the thermal insulation\nis executed by the ABS and G10 layers. It should be noted that in the\nSpheres #4 geometry, the insulation is similar to that in the plate and\npin array regenerators. The air gap between the regenerator casing\nand the inner magnet is 0.8-mm thick. Besides, the magnet has a\nmuch bigger thermal mass compared with that of the regenerator, thus,\nthe heat transfer interaction between the regenerator and the magnet\ncannot be disregarded. As will be seen, special attention has been given\nto the modeling of the heat transfer to the casing and surroundings in\nthe present thesis.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.24 \u2013 AMR insulation: (a) Casing #3; (b) Casing #5 (parallel\nplates) and Casing #6 (pin array). Casing #4 is similar to (b) but\nwith a round cross sectional area.\n\n\n\n3.6 Instrumentation and Data Acquisition 79\n\n3.6 Instrumentation and Data Acquisition\n\nFor an in-depth characterization of the thermal passive and active mag-\nnetic regenerator performances, different transducers were applied, as\npresented in Table 3.10. The instrumentation was positioned at dif-\nferent points of the experimental setup, as shown in Figs. 3.2 and 3.4\nfor the passive and AMR apparatuses, respectively. The readings were\nperformed with a National Instruments data acquisition (DAQ) sys-\ntem connected to a computer equipped with Labview 2009. The time-\ndependent variables were measured, graphically evaluated and saved\nin data files for a subsequent data regression. Additional information\nabout the main components of the DAQ are presented in Table 3.11.\n\nTable 3.10 \u2013 Summary of the instrumentation.\n\nSensor Comp.

The probes were calibrated using a standard ther-\nmometer with an uncertainty of 0.1 K. The probes and the standard\nthermometer were positioned in a thermal bath with a variable temper-\nature between 263 and 333 K (intervals of 5 K). For every temperature,\nafter stabilization, the readings were averaged over 2 minutes. The cal-\nculated uncertainty of the probes positioned at the regenerator ends,\ninside the matrix and the probes used to calculate the heater enthalpy\n\n\n\n80 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\nflux was 0.15 K. The uncertainty of the ambient temperature probes\nwas 0.2 K.\n\nThe pressure transducers were calibrated using a DH Bundenberg 580-\nseries dead-weight tester between 100 kPa and 1000 kPa. According to\nthe calibration report, the maximum uncertainty of the pressure trans-\nducers was 0.5 kPa. The scale was calibrated using standard weights\nbetween 50 and 500 g, and the uncertainty was evaluated at 0.02 g.\n\nThe uncertainties of the remaining instruments were obtained from\ntheir respective catalog information. Two different torque meters were\nused, depending on the torque being measured. To measure the indi-\nvidual torques developed by the pumping system the low range trans-\nducer was applied due to the smaller uncertainties involved. However,to\nmeasure the total torque developed by the AMR (including pumping\nsystem and magnetic circuit), which can be as high as 30 Nm, a 50\nNm (full scale) torque meter was used. Coriolis mass flow meters were\nselected for their capability of reading pulsating flows with a relatively\nlow uncertainty. The time constant of the present Coriolis flow meters\nwas such that they were capable of reading flow rate transients at low\nfrequencies (between 0.25 and 0.5 Hz). Average mass flow rates for fre-\nquencies between 0.75 and 2 Hz still can be measured with reasonable\naccuracy (to be discussed later). Nevertheless, due to the large time\nconstant, the average mass flow can be slightly overestimated up to 15\nkg/h for high mass flow rates (> 100 kg/h).\n\nA linear potentiometer is positioned in phase with the double effect\npump (see Figs. 3.13(a) and 3.14) and is used mainly to calculate the\noperating frequency to be used in the data regression. Based on the\ntime-dependent potentiometer signal, the Labview Tone Measurement\ntool reads the sinusoidal waveform and converts it into a frequency\nvalue. An excellent correlation was verified between the stepper motor\nand the potentiometer frequency signal. Also, based on the poten-\ntiometer signal, it was possible to identify the points where the hot\nand cold blows start and end. This is the first step in the evaluation\nof the performance metrics, where no phasing is verified between the\npotentiometer and temperature probes, but a small phasing, less than\n3% of the blow period, is corrected in the pressure transducers and\ntorque meter readings. Only the mass flow meters presented a more\nnoticeable phasing that can be attributed to the time constant.\n\nFor a precise time-average analysis, the data acquisition rate, fDAQ,\nwas selected according to the operating frequency as follows:\n\n\n\n3.7 Details of the Final Assembly 81\n\nfDAQ\nf\n\n= 300 (3.3)\n\nwhich means that, irrespective of the frequency, there are 150 data\npoints in the cold and hot cycles, respectively.\n\n3.7 Details of the Final Assembly\n\nThe calibration and positioning of the temperature probes are ex-\ntremely important in the present experimental analysis, since the ther-\nmal effectiveness and temperature control of the cold end in AMR tests\nare based on the time-average temperatures at the ends of the regener-\nators. Fig. 3.25(a) presents the final assembly of Casing #3, where the\ninternal and end temperature probes can be identified in Figs. 3.25(b)\nand (c). It should be noted that Casings #1, #2 and #4 are similar,\nbut Casing #1 has 3 internal probes, Casing #2 has 4 internal probes\nand Casing #3 and #4 have 5 internal probes.\n\nFig. 3.26(a) shows a picture of the parallel plate (Plates #5) regenerator\n(identical to Pins #6), with the instrumentation at the regenerator\nends. Fig. 3.26(b) shows an end temperature probe in detail. No\ninternal probes were used in the plate and pin array geometries.\n\nFig. 3.27(a) shows a picture of Casing #7, with the instrumentation\npositioned at the regenerator ends. Fig. 3.27(b) shows the end tem-\nperature probes. For Casing #7, no internal temperature probes were\nused. As Casing #7 was designed and fabricated without void volumes,\ntwo different temperature probes were used on each side; one for the\ninlet and another for the outlet flow measurements. All other matrices\nused single probes positioned in the void volume at each regenerator\nend, allowing measurements of temperatures of the inlet and outlet\nstreams.\n\n\n\n82 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\n(a)\n\n(b) (c)\n\nFigure 3.25 \u2013 Packed bed regenerators: (a) Casing #3 final assem-\nbly; (b) Internal temperature probe positioning; (c) Ends temperature\nprobe positioning.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.26 \u2013 Parallel plate and pin array regenerator: (a) Casing #5\nand #6 final assembly; (b) Ends temperature probe positioning.\n\n\n\n3.7 Details of the Final Assembly 83\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.27 \u2013 Zero void volume regenerator: (a) Casing #7 final as-\nsembly; (b) Positioning of end temperature probes.\n\nRegarding the AMR regenerators, all matrices had the same length\nand no internal temperature probes were used. Fig. 3.28(a) shows the\nfinal AMR assembly, where the regenerator region is at the middle\npart. The AMR length is 100 mm and, as presented in Fig. 3.9, the\nmagnetic circuit is 275 mm in length. To increase the final housing\nlength, the AMR is assembled between two G10 tube adapters. The\nG10 tube adapters are fitted to centering bearing housings, shown in\nFig. 3.28(c), that are positioned at the ends of the magnetic circuit\nto guarantee the concentricity between the regenerator housing and\nthe magnet cylinders. Since there is little room available around the\nmatrix, the temperature probe is assembled axially and bent to ensure\ncross flow around the probe, as shown in Fig. 3.28(b).\n\n\n\n84 3 Experimental Apparatus\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3.28 \u2013 AMR beds: (a) Final assembly; (b) Positioning of the end\ntemperature probes; (c) Final assembly with the temperature probes\nand bearing housings.\n\nFour transducers were used to measure the flow static pressure: two\nfor the hot blow (indicated by the red arrows) and two for the cold\nblow (blue arrows), as presented in Fig. 3.29. This configuration was\npreferred to avoid oscillating flow on the pressure transducers, which\nsimplifies the calculation of the time-average pressure drop, especially\nin terms of phasing between the temperature and pressure readings.\n\nFig. 3.30 shows cutaway views of the passive and active regenerator\nsetup, showing in detail the position of the temperature probes and\npressure transducers.\n\n\n\n3.7 Details of the Final Assembly 85\n\nFigure 3.29 \u2013 Positions of the pressure transducers.

The fluid flow and heat transfer in\nthe porous medium are modeled using a one-dimensional, transient,\nthermal non-equilibrium approach. Besides the magnetic field depen-\ndent physical properties, the main difference between the passive and\nAMR thermal models lies in the presence of a source term in the solid\nenergy equation, which is responsible for the magnetocaloric effect.\n\n4.1 Regenerative Porous Matrix Modeling\n\nThe regenerator matrix is treated as a porous medium, with a void\nvolume fraction (porosity), ?, occupied by the fluid phase. The solid\nphase fraction is 1??. Thermal non-equilibrium is assumed between the\nphases, which have different temperatures (KAVIANY, 1995). A volume-\naverage approach (QUINTARD; WHITAKER, 1993; KAVIANY, 1995) was\nadopted to avoid the computational costs involved in solving the trans-\nfer processes at the pore scale level. In the one-dimensional formulation,\nthe heat transfer between the phases is modeled in terms of an inter-\nstitial heat transfer coefficient, evaluated based on correlations for the\nNusselt number.\n\nThe passive regenerator model comprises the momentum equation,\nwhich is used to calculate the fluid flow through the porous matrix\nand conjugate energy equations for the fluid and solid phases. To ex-\ntend this heat transfer model to the AMR case, a magnetic model is\nincorporated into the heat transfer calculation loop to compute the\n\n\n\n88 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nmagnetocaloric effect (MCE) and the demagnetization losses.\n\nThe mathematical model of the fluid flow and heat transfer in a re-\ngenerative porous matrix is described next.

The fluid enters the\nregenerator at constant and uniform temperatures, i.e., TCE = TC at\nthe cold end and THE = TH at the hot end, where TC and TH are the\ntemperatures of the cold and hot thermal reservoirs, respectively.\n\n4.1.1 Momentum Equation\n\nThe macroscopic momentum equation, also known as Brinkman-Forch-\nheimer equation, is given by (KAVIANY, 1995; NIELD; BEJAN, 2006):\n\n\n\n4.1 Regenerative Porous Matrix Modeling 89\n\n?f\n?\n\n(\n?~v\n\n?t\n+ ~v \u00b7?~v\n\n)\n= ??P + ?f~f +\n\n\u00b5f\n?\n?2~v ?\n\n\u00b5f\nK\n~v ?\n\ncE?f\nK1/2\n\n|~v|~v (4.1)\n\nwhere the term on the left is the macroscopic inertial force and those\non the right are the pore pressure gradient, body force, macroscopic\nviscous shear stress (Brinkman viscous term), microscopic shear stress\n(Darcy term) and microscopic inertial force (Ergun inertial term), re-\nspectively. In the fluid flow model, the fluid properties were treated as\nconstants obtained at an average fluid temperature. The solutions of\nthe flow and temperature fields are, therefore, uncoupled. This sim-\nplifies the model and reduces significantly the convergence time, since\nit is not necessary to solve the pressure-velocity coupling to guarantee\nthe mass conservation. Using the simplifying assumptions (2), (3) and\n(4), one can neglect ~v \u00b7?~v, the Brinkman viscous term and the body\nforce term, respectively. Therefore:\n\n?f\n?\n\n(\n?u\n\n?t\n\n)\n= ?\n\n?P\n\n?z\n?\n\u00b5f\nK\nu?\n\ncE?f\nK1/2\n\n|u|u (4.2)\n\nwhere t is the time, u is the superficial (Darcian) flow velocity, ? is the\ndensity, \u00b5 is the dynamic viscosity. Additionally, K is the permeability\nof the porous media and cE is the Ergun constant, which depend on\nthe geometry and porosity of the matrix and are evaluated based on a\nclosure relationships that will be presented Section 4.3.\n\nThe non-dimensionalization of Eq. (4.2) is explained next. The di-\nmensionless time is defined as t? = ?t, where ? = 2?f is the angular\nfrequency and f the cycle frequency. To describe the oscillatory flow in\nthe regenerator, the pressure gradient can be approximated by a time-\ndependent function, which contains a characteristic waveform (ZHAO;\nCHENG, 1996, 1998; OLIVEIRA et al., 2012):\n\n?\n?P\n\n?z\n= ?fAtg(t\n\n?) (4.3)\n\nwhere At is the amplitude of the pressure drop waveform and g(t\n?) is\n\nthe dimensionless mathematical function that describes the waveform.\nIn the present thesis, since the fluid flow is generated by a double effect\n\n\n\n90 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\ndisplacer coupled to a rotating crank disc, the fluid flow has a sinusoidal\nwaveform, hence g(t?) = sin(?t). Thus, in Eq. (4.2), the dimensionless\n\npressure gradient can be approximated directly by ??P\n?z\n\n???? = g(t?).\nThe dimensionless velocity in the momentum equation is defined as\nu?D = u/uD,max, where uD,max is the maximum velocity calculated via\nthe Darcy Equation, i.e., when the dimensionless pressure gradient is\nconstant and maximum, g(t?) = 1. As a result:\n\nuD,max = ?\nK\n\n\u00b5f\n\n?P\n\n?z\n\n???\nmax\n\n= ?\nK\n\n?f\nAt (4.4)\n\nTherefore, when terms other than the microscopic shear stress are non-\nnegligible, the actual maximum velocity in the porous medium, umax,\nis different from uD,max, which means that the value of u\n\n?\nD = u/uD,max\n\nis, in general, less than unity. In geometries such as parallel plates, the\nshear stress is small and, as a result, uD,max = umax. The dimensionless\nmomentum equation in its final form is given by:\n\nRe?Da\n\n?\n\n?u?D\n?t?\n\n= g(t?) ?u?D ?F|u\n?\nD|u\n?\nD (4.5)\n\nwhere the dimensionless groups are the kinetic Reynolds number\nRe? = ?d\n\n2\nh/?f, the Darcy number Da = K/d\n\n2\nh and the Forchheimer\n\nnumber F = cEAtK\n1.5/?2f . In the above equations, ?f is the kinematic\n\nviscosity, dh = 4?/? is the porous medium hydraulic diameter and ? is\nthe surface area density of the porous medium.\n\n4.1.2 Energy Equations\n\nThe derivation of the energy equations for the fluid and solid phases\nconsiders the one-dimensional, laminar, incompressible fluid flow in the\nporous medium. The thermophysical properties of both phases depend\non the temperature and, in the active magnetic regenerator case, the\nproperties of the magnetocaloric material also depend on the magnetic\nflux density. Again, it is important to note that the momentum equa-\ntion and the energy equations are solved uncoupled. Hence, the flow\nvelocity is an input parameter in the energy solver.\n\n\n\n4.1 Regenerative Porous Matrix Modeling 91\n\n4.1.2.1 Fluid Phase Energy Equation\n\nThe macroscopic energy balance for the fluid phase is given by,\n\n?f(T)cp,f(T)\n\n(\n?\n?Tf\n?t\n\n+ u\n?Tf\n?z\n\n)\n= h(z)?(Ts ?Tf) +\n\n?????u?P?z\n?????+\n\n?\n[\n?efff + ?f(T)cp,f(T)D||\n\n]?2Tf\n?z2\n\n+ q?csg (4.6)\n\nwhere the terms on the left are due to inertial (thermal capacity) effects\nand longitudinal advection, and those on the right are the interstitial\nheat transfer term calculated using a convective heat transfer coeffi-\ncient, the viscous dissipation, the axial conduction and the casing heat\ntransfer terms, respectively (KAVIANY, 1995; NIELD; BEJAN, 2006). Tf\nis the fluid temperature and Ts is the solid temperature, cp,f is the fluid\nspecific heat capacity, ?efff is the effective thermal conductivity of the\nfluid phase, D|| is the longitudinal thermal dispersion and Pr is the\nPrandtl number based on the fluid properties. In dimensionless form,\nEq. (4.6) is given by,\n\n??f\n?t?\n\n= NudhFof(?s ??f) ?\nRemax\nRe??\n\nu?\n??f\n?z?\n\n+\nBr\n\nPr\n\n?????g(t?)u?\n?????+\n\n1\n\nPrRe??2\n\n(\nkefff\nkf(T)\n\n+\nD||\n\n?f\n\n)\n?2?f\n?z?2\n\n+ q??csg (4.7)\n\nwhere the dimensionless fluid and solid temperatures are given by\n?f,s = (Tf,s ?TC)/(TH ?TC), where TC and TH are the cold and hot\nreservoir temperatures, respectively. In the energy equation, the di-\nmensionless superficial velocity is defined as u? = u/umax, where umax\nis the maximum instantaneous velocity in the oscillatory flow field al-\nready known from the momentum solution. z? = z/LReg is the di-\nmensionless axial distance, and LReg is the length of the regenerator\nbed. The aspect ratio based on the hydraulic diameter of the porous\nmedium is defined as ? = LReg/dh. Finally, ?f = kf(T)/(?f(T)cp,f(T))\nis the thermal diffusivity of the fluid.\n\nThe dimensionless numbers in Eq. (4.7) are the Nusselt number based\non the hydraulic diameter Nudh = h(z)dh/kf(T), the Fourier number\n\n\n\n92 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nfor the fluid phase Fof = ?f/?(dh/2)\n2, the Reynolds number based\n\non the maximum velocity and on the hydraulic diameter Remax =\n\n(umax/?)dh/?f(T) and the Brinkman number Br =\n\u00b5f(T)At(umax/?)\nkf(T)?(TH?TC)\n\n. The\n\nvariables ?efff , D|| and Nudh depend on the geometry of the porous me-\ndia and are calculated using specific closure relationships that will be\npresented in Section 4.3. The dimensionless casing heat transfer term,\nq??csg, is defined in Section 4.2.2\n\nThe dependence of the fluid properties, namely ?, cp, k and \u00b5, on the\ntemperature was considered by means of interpolations from the EES\n(Engineering Equation Solver) database (KLEIN, 2013). In the passive\nregenerator modeling, the properties were those of distilled water, while\nin the AMR modeling the fluid was a mixture of distilled water and\nethylene-glycol (80%/20% wt.).\n\n4.1.2.2 Solid Phase Energy Equation\n\nThe macroscopic energy balance for the solid phase is given by:\n\n?s(T)cs(T)(1??)\n?Ts\n?t\n\n= h(z)?(Tf ?Ts) + (1??)keffs\n?2Ts\n?z2\n\n+ q?MCE (4.8)\n\nwhere the term on the left accounts for thermal inertia in the solid,\nand those on the right are due to interstitial heat convection, axial heat\nconduction and the magnetocaloric effect source term (if applicable),\nrespectively. ?s is the solid density, cs is the solid specific heat capacity\nand keffs is the effective thermal conductivity of the solid (KAVIANY,\n1995; NIELD; BEJAN, 2006).\n\nUsing the same dimensionless variables of the fluid energy equation,\nthe dimensionless form of the solid phase energy equation is given by:\n\n??s\n?t?\n\n= BiFos(?f ??s) +\n?effs /kf(T)\n\nPrRe??2\n<?\n\n?2?s\n?z?2\n\n+ q??MCE (4.9)\n\nwhere Bi = h(z)`c/ks(T) is the Biot number and Fos = ?s/?`\n2\nc is\n\nthe Fourier number of the solid phase. ?s = ks(T)/(?s(T)cs(T)) is the\nthermal diffusivity of the solid, `c = (1 ? ?)/? is the characteristic\nlength of the porous medium and&lt;? = ?f(T)cpf(T)/?s(T)cs(T) is the\n\n\n\n4.2 Losses Modeling 93\n\nthermal capacity ratio. The effective thermal conductivity of the solid,\n?effs , depends on the geometry of the porous medium and is calculated\nusing an appropriate closure relationship to be described in Section 4.3.\nThe Biot number can be calculated based on the Nusselt number, Bi\n= (`c/dh)(kf(T)/ks(T))Nu. The dimensionless magnetocaloric term,\nq??MCE, is defined in Section 4.4.1.\n\nThe dependence of the solid properties of the passive matrix, namely\n?, c and k, on the temperature were calculated via interpolations of\nthe properties of stainless steel available in EES (KLEIN, 2013). In the\nmodeling of active regenerators, the properties of Gd were estimated\nusing a specific calculation procedure to be described in Section 4.4.3.\n\n4.2 Losses Modeling\n\nThe modeling of different types of losses is necessary for a more precise\ncomparison with the experimental data, which leads to more consistent\nevaluations of the physical phenomena involving heat transfer and fluid\nflow. Regarding the void volume losses, Jacobs and Zimm (2008) pre-\nsented numerical results that showed a significant impact of the void\nvolume size on the AMR cooling capacity. According to Nielsen et\nal. (2011), the heat interactions between the regenerator bed and its\nsurroundings are disregarded in most AMR models, which assume a\nperfect insulation of the bed and ignore the thermal interactions with\nthe regenerator housing. Thus, the present numerical model introduces\na comprehensive modeling of thermal and void volume losses in order\nto better evaluate their impact on the thermal performance of passive\nand active magnetic regenerators.\n\n4.2.1 Void Volume Modeling\n\nThe void volume modeling consists in evaluating the time-dependent\ntemperature of the fluid in the space between each regenerator end and\nthe adjacent heat exchanger. At the end of a given blow, a volume\nof fluid stops in the void volume and returns to the regenerator bed\nin the next blow. This fluid does not interact with the thermal reser-\nvoirs. Moreover, the fluid that returns to the regenerator does so at\na temperature that is actually time dependent. The temperatures of\nthe fluid entering the regenerator at the cold and hot ends (during the\n\n\n\n94 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\ncold and hot blows, respectively), coming from the void volumes, are\ntermed here T vvf (t)|CE and T\n\nvv\nf (t)|HE. These temperatures are calcu-\n\nlated based on a solution of the energy equation for the cold and hot\nvoid volumes. Fig. 4.2 shows the basic geometry of the 1-D fluid flow\nand heat transfer model including the void volumes, which are modeled\nas an extension of the regenerator bed without the porous medium.\n\n \n\nLVV\n\nz\n\nCOLD \nRESERVOIR\n\nTC\n\nHOT  \nRESERVOIR \n\nTH\n\nSolid \nPhase\n\nFluid \nPhase\n\nLReg  \n\nCOLD \nRESERVOIR\n\nTC\n\nHOT  \nRESERVOIR\n\nTH\n\nz\ny\n\nCOLD SOURCE Cold Void \nVolume\n\nPipe Line \n\nAc,Reg\n\nAc,Reg\n\nz\nLReg  LVV\n\nHot Void \nVolume\n\nCold Void \nVolume\n\nLVV\n\nCOLD \nRESERVOIR\n\nTC\n\nHOT  \nRESERVOIR\n\nTH\n\nAc,Reg\n\nLVV\n\nHot Void \nVolume\n\nCold Void \nVolume\n\nRegenerator Casing\n\nz\ny\n\nHOT SOURCE\n\nAReg\n\nHot Void \nVolume\n\nRegenerator Casing\n\nLReg\n\nLVV LVVLRegLpipe\n\ntcsg\n\nAir Gap\n\nMagnetic Circuit\n\n \n\newall\n\neair\n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Basic geometry of the 1-D fluid flow and heat transfer\nmodel including the void volumes.\n\nThe assumptions made in the derivation of the energy equation for the\nvoid volumes are as follows:\n\n1. One dimensional, laminar and incompressible flow;\n\n2. The void volumes have the same cross sectional area as the re-\ngenerator bed. Hence, the flow velocity in the void volumes is the\nsame as the superficial velocity in the regenerator;\n\n3. The heat transfer with the walls is negligible;\n\n4. The hot and cold void volumes are identical;\n\n5. The fluid properties depend only on the temperature.\n\nThe void volume length, Lvv, is calculated based on the void volume\nfraction, ??, defined in Eq. (3.2), where the size of the void volume is\ndefined as ? = Ac,RegLvv. Therefore:\n\nLvv = ??\n?Lreg (4.10)\n\nAfter the assumptions, the energy equation for the fluid in the void\nvolume is given by:\n\n\n\n4.2 Losses Modeling 95\n\n?T vvf\n?t\n\n= ?u\n?T vvf\n?z\n\n+\nkf\n\n?fcp,f\n\n?2T vvf\n?z2\n\n(4.11)\n\nand in dimensionless form it becomes:\n\n??vvf\n?t?\n\n= ?\nRevvmax\nRevv? ?\n\nvv\nu?\n??vvf\n?z?\n\n+\n1\n\nPrRevv? ?\nvv2\n\n?2?vvf\n?z?2\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere the dimensionless groups are now based on the regenerator hous-\ning hydraulic diameter, Dh,Reg, and on the void volume length, Lvv.\nThus: Revvmax = (umax/?)Dh,Reg/?f; Re\n\nvv\n? = ?D\n\n2\nh,Reg/?f; z\n\n? = z/Lvv\nand ?vv = LReg/Dh,Reg. The other dimensionless variables have been\ndefined as before.\n\n4.2.2 Casing Heat Transfer Modeling\n\nThe casing heat transfer modeling consists in determining the heat\ntransfer rate per unit volume through the regenerator casing wall, q?csg.\nThis loss is more significant in the AMR simulation, because the ther-\nmal insulation around the passive regenerator is more effective. In the\nAMR experiments, there is little room for a good thermal insulation\nand, as a result, the heat gained from the external environment can\ndeteriorate the performance of the AMR. Thus, q?csg has been included\nas a source term in the fluid energy equation (Eq. (4.6)).\n\nFig. 4.3 shows the basic geometry of the 1-D fluid flow and heat transfer\nmodel including the void volumes and the adjacent domains. In addi-\ntion to the casing wall and air gap (thicknesses ewall and eair, respec-\ntively), the magnetic circuit is also considered in the heat interactions.\n\nThe following assumptions are considered in the casing heat transfer\nmodeling:\n\n1. The heat transfer in the wall and air gap is two-dimensional, i.e.,\nboth the radial and longitudinal directions are considered;\n\n2. The curvature of the regenerator wall is negligible so that a carte-\nsian coordinate system can be used to describe the problem ge-\nometry;\n\n3. The air properties depend only on the temperature;\n\n\n\n96 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\n \n\nLVV\n\nz\n\nCOLD \nRESERVOIR\n\nTC\n\nHOT  \nRESERVOIR \n\nTH\n\nSolid \nPhase\n\nFluid \nPhase\n\nLReg  \n\nCOLD \nRESERVOIR\n\nTC\n\nHOT  \nRESERVOIR\n\nTH\n\nz\ny\n\nCOLD SOURCE Cold Void \nVolume\n\nPipe Line \n\nAc,Reg\n\nAc,Reg\n\nz\nLReg  LVV\n\nHot Void \nVolume\n\nCold Void \nVolume\n\nLVV\n\nCOLD \nRESERVOIR\n\nTC\n\nHOT  \nRESERVOIR\n\nTH\n\nAc,Reg\n\nLVV\n\nHot Void \nVolume\n\nCold Void \nVolume\n\nRegenerator Casing\n\nz\ny\n\nHOT SOURCE\n\nAReg\n\nHot Void \nVolume\n\nRegenerator Casing\n\nLReg\n\nLVV LVVLRegLpipe\n\ntcsg\n\nAir Gap\n\nMagnetic Circuit\n\n \n\newall\n\neair\n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Basic geometry of the 1-D fluid flow and heat transfer\nmodel including the void volumes and the adjacent domains (wall, air\ngap and magnet).\n\n4. The wall properties are constant but, depending on the wall ma-\nterial, the transversal (i.e., radial) and longitudinal thermal con-\nductivities can be different. Thus, specifically for the G10 casing\nkwall,y 6= kwall,z.\n\n5. Since the thermal mass of the magnetic circuit is very large, the\ntemperature of the magnet is assumed constant.\n\nTo calculate q?csg, the energy balances in the air gap and regenerator\nwall need to be evaluated. The energy equation for the air layer is given\nby:\n\n?Tair\n?t\n\n=\nk\n\n?cp\n\n???\nair\n\n?2Tair\n?y2\n\n+\nk\n\n?cp\n\n???\nair\n\n?2Tair\n?z2\n\n+\nq?air\n?cp|air\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere q?air is the viscous dissipation rate per unit volume, estimated\nassuming laminar Couette flow in the gap:\n\nq?air = \u00b5air\n\n(\n?Ri,I\neair\n\n)2\n(4.14)\n\n\n\n4.2 Losses Modeling 97\n\nwhere Ri,I is the inner radius of the internal Halbach cylinder.

(4.15) is solved for both layers of the casing. After solving the\nenergy equations for the air gap and regenerator wall, q?csg is calculated\nby:\n\nq?csg = ?hwall\nPc,Reg\nAc,Reg\n\n(Tf ?Twall|(y=0)) (4.16)\n\nwhere Pc,Reg is the internal perimeter of the regenerator section and\nhwall is the internal wall heat transfer coefficient (to be defined in Sec-\ntion 4.3.6). In dimensionless form, the energy equations for the air gap\nand regenerator wall are given by:\n\n??air\n?t?\n\n=\n?air\n?e2air\n\n?2?air\n?y?2\n\n+\n?air\n?L2Reg\n\n?2?air\n?z?2\n\n+\nq?air\n\n?cp|air??THex\n(4.17)\n\n??wall\n?t?\n\n=\n?y,wall\n?e2wall\n\n?2?wall\n?y?2\n\n+\n?z,wall\n?L2Reg\n\n?2?wall\n?z?2\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhere y? = y/eair or y\n? = y/ewall, depending on the domain. It is\n\nimportant to notice that Eqs. (4.7), (4.17), (4.18) and (4.16) are solved\ncoupled in the energy equation loop. The boundary conditions will be\nexplained in detail in Section 4.5.\n\nAdditionally, the dimensionless q?csg to include in the dimensionless form\nof the fluid phase energy equation (Eq. (4.7)) is given by:\n\nq??csg = ?Nu\nwall\ndh FofA\n\n?(?f ??wall|(y*=0)) (4.19)\n\nwhere Nuwall = hwalldh/kf and A\n? =\n\nPc,Regdh\nAc,Reg\n\nis the dimensionless\n\nperimeter-area relation.\n\n\n\n98 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\n4.3 Closure Relationships\n\n4.3.1 Particle Diameter and Surface Area Density\n\nBefore presenting the closure relationships, it is important to define\nthe equivalent particle diameter, dp, and the surface area density, ?,\nof the porous medium. The surface area density is defined as the ratio\nof the interstitial area, AHT, to the overall matrix volume, Vs/(1 ??),\nwhere Vs is the volume of solid material in the matrix. Thus (KAVIANY,\n1995):\n\n? = (1 ??)Sv (4.20)\n\nwhere Sv = AHT/Vs is the specific surface area, i.e., the interstitial\narea per unit solid volume. The equivalent particle diameter, in turn,\nis given by:\n\ndp =\n6\n\nSv\n(4.21)\n\nThe geometry of the porous beds investigated in this thesis (i.e., packed\nbed of monodisperse spheres, parallel plates and square pin arrays) are\nsimple enough so that the relationships that define their Sv and dp are\nstraightforward. Therefore, for each different matrix geometry, one has\n(KAVIANY, 1995):\n\nSv =\n6\n\ndsph\n; dp = dsph (for bed of spheres) (4.22)\n\nSv =\n4\n\nepin\n; dp =\n\n3\n\n2\nepin (for pin arrays) (4.23)\n\nSv ?\n2\n\nePP\n; dp = 3ePP (for parallel plates) (4.24)\n\nwhere dsph is the spherical particle diameter, epin is the square pin side\nlength and ePP is the parallel plate thickness.\n\n\n\n4.3 Closure Relationships 99\n\n4.3.2 Permeability and Ergun Constant\n\nThe momentum equation requires closure relationships for the porous\nmedium permeability and Ergun constant. The permeability, K, can\nbe written in the following form:\n\nK =\n?\n\n16kk\nd2h (4.25)\n\nwhere kk is the Kozeny constant and dh is related to the particle diam-\neter by:\n\ndh =\n2\n\n3\n\n?\n\n1 ??\ndp (4.26)\n\nFor parallel plates, the Kozeny constant can be determined from a solu-\ntion of the Navier-Stokes equation for fully developed flow (KAVIANY,\n1995). For packed spheres, the value suggested by Ergun (1952) was\nused, where 16kk = 150. For pin arrays, there are several available\ncorrelations for the permeability (KAVIANY, 1995; NAKAYAMA; KUWA-\nHARA, 2005; YAZDCHI et al., 2011). However, none of them were found\nappropriate for the pin array geometry studied in the present work.\nThus, kk was calculated based on the tortuosity, ?, of the porous me-\ndium, as suggested by Kaviany (1995), p. 33, where kk = ko?\n\n2. As-\nsuming ko = 2.5 and ? = Le/L = 2\n\n1/2, where Le = 2\n1/2L, results in\n\nkk = 5. Therefore:\n\nkk = 9.375 (for packed beds of spheres (ERGUN, 1952))\n\nkk = 5 (for pin arrays)\n\nkk = 2 (for parallel plates (KAVIANY, 1995))\n\nThe Ergun constant, cE, can be generically written as follows:\n\ncE =\na\n\n(16kk?3)1/2\n(4.27)\n\n\n\n100 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nwhere a is a constant proportional to the Ergun inertial term in the\nmomentum equation. Hence, a is larger in geometries where the accel-\neration term is more important:\n\na = 1.75 (for packed beds of spheres (ERGUN, 1952))\n\na = 2/3 (for pin arrays)\n\na = 0 (for parallel plates)\n\nIt is well known that for parallel plates the flow acceleration is nil. For\npacked beds of spheres, the value of a proposed by Ergun (1952) has\nbeen adopted. Finally, for pin arrays, the acceleration effect of the\nfluid is smaller when compared with the the bed of spheres. In the\nliterature, there are different approaches to the modeling of cE for pin\narrays (KAVIANY, 1995; NAKAYAMA; KUWAHARA, 2005; NIELD; BEJAN,\n2006; TERUEL; RIZWAN-UDDIN, 2009; TAMAYOL et al., 2010). However,\nnone of them reproduced well the present pin array porous media, due\nto different dimensions and ranges of operating conditions. Thus, the\ngeneral procedure suggested on p. 67 of Kaviany (1995) was adopted\nhere, which resulted in the constant a being equal to 2/3.\n\n4.3.3 Interstitial Heat Transfer Coefficient\n\nThe interstitial heat transfer coefficient, h, was calculated using Nusselt\nnumber correlations written in terms of an appropriate characteristic\nlength. For parallel plates, the correlation of Nickolay and Martin\n(2002) was used because it accounts for entrance effects on the paral-\nlel plate geometry, resulting in a Nusselt number, Nudh(z), that is a\nfunction of the longitudinal position, 0 ? z ? LReg:\n\nNudh(z) =\nh(z)dh\nkf\n\n= Nu?\nNu2\n\n3\n\n(\nNu2\nNu\n\n)n-1\n(4.28)\n\nwhere Nu = (Nun1 + Nu\nn\n2 )\n\n1/n, Nu1 = 7.541, Nu2 = 1.841[Gz(z)]\n1/3\n\nand n = 3, 592. The Graetz number is defined as Gz(z) = (dh/z)Pe and\n\n\n\n4.3 Closure Relationships 101\n\nPe = dh(u/?)/?f. The hydraulic diameter in the parallel plate geome-\ntry is twice the channel thickness.\n\nThe interstitial convective heat transfer coefficient for packed bed of\nspheres and pin arrays was calculated using the particle diameter-based\nNusselt number correlation proposed by (PALLARES; GRAU, 2010):\n\nNudp =\nhdp\nkf\n\n= 2\n\n(\n1 +\n\n4(1 ??)\n?\n\n)\n+ (1 ??)1/2Re0.6dp Pr\n\n1/3 (4.29)\n\nwhere Redp is the Reynolds number based on the particle diameter.\nThis correlation was preferred instead of more traditional ones for beds\nof spheres (WAKAO; KAGUEI, 1982; WHITAKER, 1983) because it is valid\nfor porosities between 0.2 and 0.9 and for a wide range of Prandtl\nnumbers and low Reynolds numbers (Redp &lt;100) (KUWAHARA et al.,\n2001; PALLARES; GRAU, 2010). A more in-depth discussion regarding\nthe Nusselt number correlation is presented in Appendix C.\n\n4.3.4 Effective Thermal Conductivity\n\nThe effective thermal conductivity is the volume-averaged thermal con-\nductivity used to evaluate the macroscopic heat transfer through a\nporous medium. In the non-equilibrium formulation, there is an ef-\nfective thermal conductivity for each phase, as will be presented as\nfollows.\n\n4.3.4.1 Fluid Phase Effective Thermal Conductivity\n\nThe effective thermal conductivity of the fluid phase for parallel plates\nand packed spheres is evaluated by (KAVIANY, 1995):\n\nkefff\nkf\n\n= ? (4.30)\n\nand for pin arrays the relationship is (KAVIANY, 1995):\n\n\n\n102 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nkefff\nkf\n\n= 1 ? (1 ??)1/2 (4.31)\n\n4.3.4.2 Solid Phase Effective Thermal Conductivity\n\nThe effective thermal conductivity of the solid phase for parallel plates\nis given by (KAVIANY, 1995):\n\nkeffs\nkf\n\n= (1 ??)\nks\nkf\n\n(4.32)\n\nFor packed spheres, the Hadley (1986) correlation is recommended:\n\nkeffs\nkf\n\n= (1 ??0)\n?f0 + (1 ??f0)kskf\n\n1 ??(1 ? f0) + kskf ?(1 ? f0)\n+\n\n?0\n2\n(\nks\nkf\n\n)2\n(1 ??) + (1 + 2?)ks\n\nkf\n\n(2 + ?)ks\nkf\n\n+ (1 ??)\n(4.33)\n\nwhere f0 = 0.8 and log ?0 = ?1.084 ? 6.778(? ? 0.298) are valid for\n0.298 ? ? ? 0.58. For pin arrays, keffs is defined as (KAVIANY, 1995):\n\nkeffs\nkf\n\n=\n(1 ??)1/2 ks\n\nkf\n\n(1 ? (1 ??)1/2)ks\nkf\n\n+ (1 ??)1/2\n(4.34)\n\n4.3.5 Longitudinal Dispersion\n\nIn 1-D porous media modeling, the dispersion is due to fluid mixing\nalong the bed, in the direction of flow. This way, the longitudinal\ndispersion, D||, can be treated as an axial conduction term.\n\nFor parallel plates, D|| is calculated by the following equation suggested\nby Engelbrecht (2008):\n\nD||\n\n?f\n=\nPe2dh\n210\n\n(4.35)\n\n\n\n4.3 Closure Relationships 103\n\nwhere the Peclet number based on the hydraulic diameter is\nPedh = Pr(u/?)dh/?f.\n\nFor packed spheres, the well established correlation of Koch and Brady\n(1985) was used:\n\nD||\n\n?f\n=\n\n?\n2\n\n60\n\n(Pedp/2)\n2\n\n(1 ??)1/2\nfor\n\n(\nPedp\n\n2\n\n)2\n<&lt;1 (4.36)\n\nD||\n\n?f\n= 0.75\n\nPedp\n2\n\nfor\nPedp\n\n2\n> 1 (4.37)\n\nwhere the Peclet number based on the particle diameter is\nPedp = Pr(udp)/?f.\n\nFor pin arrays, D|| is evaluated by the correlation proposed by DeGroot\nand Straatman (2012) for a staggered array of circular cylinders:\n\nD||\n\n?f\n= 0.0054Re1.8d Pr\n\n1.7 for Ped &lt;10 (4.38)\n\nD||\n\n?f\n= 0.016Re1.5d Pr\n\n1.1 for Ped > 10 (4.39)\n\nwhere the Reynolds and Peclet numbers are based on the pin size,\nd = epin. Thus, Red = uepin/?f and Ped = RedPr.\n\n4.3.6 Wall Heat Transfer Coefficient\n\nThe heat transfer to the regenerator wall, hwall, is evaluated via Nus-\nselt number correlations based on the particle diameter, i.e., Nuwall =\nhwalldp/kf(T). For packed beds of spheres, the use of the empirical cor-\nrelation presented in Li and Finlayson (1977) is suggested. Thus (LI;\nFINLAYSON, 1977; WAKAO; KAGUEI, 1982):\n\nNuwalldp = 0.17Re\n0.79\ndp for 20 ? Redp ? 7600 (4.40)\n\n\n\n104 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\n4.4 Magnetic Properties and their Imple-\nmentation\n\nThe adiabatic temperature change, ?Tad(?B,T) is illustrated in\nFig. 2.4. For a magnetic material at an equilibrium state specified\nby an initial temperature T0 and magnetic field B0, the total entropy\nis s0(B0,T0). If a variation in the applied field, ?B = B1 ? B0,\nis performed adiabatically, the total entropy of the system remains\nconstant, and s1 = s0. Therefore, a new equilibrium state is reached at\ns1(B1,T1). The difference between the initial and final temperatures\nis the adiabatic temperature change, i.e., ?Tad(?B,T) = T1 ? T0. If\n?B > 0, then ?Tad(?B,T) is positive and, reversibly, when ?B &lt;0,\n?Tad(?B,T) is negative. An extended discussion on the calculation of\n?Tad(?B,T) for magnetization and demagnetization, and its impact\non the regenerator performance is available in Bahl and Nielsen (2009),\nNielsen et al. (2010), Trevizoli et al. (2012). The implementation of the\nMCE and of the demagnetizing losses on the AMR model are discussed\nnext.\n\n4.4.1 Implementation of the Magnetocaloric Effect\n\nIn AMR modeling, the MCE may be implemented in two different\nforms. The first is the so-called discrete approach, which is the simplest\nand most straightforward calculation method (NIELSEN et al., 2011). It\nconsists of a direct temperature increment (or reduction) during the\nmagnetization (or demagnetization) step. Thus, for a one-dimensional\ndomain:\n\nTs(t + ?t,z) = Ts(t,z) + ?Tad(?B,Ts(t,z)) (4.41)\n\nwhere ?B = B(t + ?t,z) ?B(t,z).\n\nThe second form is the so-called built-in approach, where the MCE is\nmodeled as an instantaneous energy rate per unit volume, q?MCE, which\nis included as a source term in the solid energy equation (4.8) (NIELSEN\net al., 2011), where q?MCE is given by (ENGELBRECHT, 2008; NIELSEN et\nal., 2011):\n\n\n\n4.4 Magnetic Properties and their Implementation 105\n\nq?MCE(t+?t,z) = ??s(1??)Ts(t,z)\n?s(B(t,z),Ts(t,z))\n\n?B(t,z)\n\n?B(t,z)\n\n?t\n(4.42)\n\nAccording to Nielsen et al. (2011), the processes of magnetization and\ndemagnetization can be simulated using both approaches, but the se-\nlection of the most appropriate one depends on the conditions of the\nsimulation. When the magnetic flux density changes continuously with\ntime, such as in the magnetic circuits used in the present AMR ex-\nperimental apparatus, the built-in approach is the best. On the other\nhand, for a step change in the magnetic flux density, the simplest dis-\ncrete approach is sufficient. However, it should be noted that step\nchanges in magnetic flux density (magnetization and demagnetization)\nare very hard to implement in practice, so the vast majority of AMR\napparatuses actually employ some type of continuous change in the\nmagnetic flux density. A drawback of the built-in approach is that it\nrequires somewhat refined data sets for the magnetocaloric properties\nand specific heat capacity as a function of temperature and magnetic\nflux density in order to calculate the entropy derivative. These may not\nbe always available, especially for new materials that rely heavily on\nthe experimental characterization of its parameters. As a result, when\nthe required data are not available, the discrete method may be the\nonly approach possible.\n\nBoth approaches to calculate the MCE were employed in the present\nmodel. In each case, ?Tad and ?s/?B were calculated based on the\nentropy lines in a T ?s diagram, as described earlier in Fig. 2.4. Eval-\nuating the MCE from the T ? s diagram is the most advantageous\nbecause it takes the reversibility of the MCE directly into account. As\nwill be seen in Section 4.7.2, if a refined magnetocaloric properties data\nset (e.g., T ? s lines) is available, even for a continuous magnetic flux\ndensity variation, both approaches give numerical results that are in\ngood agreement.\n\nIn terms of dimensionless parameters, the discrete and built-in methods\nare given, respectively, by:\n\n?s(t\n? + ?t?,z?) = ?s(t\n\n?,z?) +\n?Tad(?B,Ts(t,z))\n\n?THex\n(4.43)\n\n\n\n106 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nq??MCE(t\n? + ?t?,z?) =\n\nTs(t,z)\ncs(B,Ts(t,z))\n\n?s(B,Ts(t,z))\n?B\n\n?B\n?t\n\n??THex\n(4.44)\n\nwhere ?THex = TH ? TC is the temperature difference between the\nthermal reservoirs (i.e., hot and cold heat exchangers).\n\n4.4.2 Magnetic Losses due to Demagnetizing Ef-\nfects\n\nWhen a magnetic material is subjected to a magnetic flux density, the\nresulting (effective) magnetic field vector, ~Heff, is different from the\n\napplied magnetic field, ~Hapl. This is due to an internal demagnetizing\n\nfield, ~Hdem, which is proportional to the demagnetizing tensor, ND,\nand to the magnetization, ~M( ~Hapl,T). Thus (BAHL et al., 2008; SMITH\net al., 2010; TREVIZOLI et al., 2012, 2013b):\n\n~Heff = ~Hapl ? ~Hdem( ~Hapl,T) (4.45)\n\nwhere\n\n~Hdem( ~Hapl,T) = ND \u00b7 ~M( ~Hapl,T) (4.46)\n\nIf the product between the demagnetization tensor and the magneti-\nzation is large, which is often the case when the material is in the\nferromagnetic phase (T &lt;TCurie), then ~Hdem is also large, yielding val-\n\nues of ~Heff much smaller than ~Hapl. This constitutes a reduction in the\nadiabatic temperature change of the magnetocaloric material and a loss\nin terms of temperature span and cooling capacity. Thus, a properly\ndesigned regenerator should have, in principle, a small demagnetizing\ntensor (factor), which depends chiefly on the regenerator geometry and\norientation with respect to the applied field.\n\nAt a constant (uniform) temperature, Eq. (4.45) can be simplified as\nthe demagnetization tensor becomes a scalar. Thus, for a homogeneous\ntemperature solid:\n\n\n\n4.4 Magnetic Properties and their Implementation 107\n\nHeff = Hapl ?NDM(Hapl,T) (4.47)\n\nwhere ND is the demagnetization factor. Trevizoli et al. (2012) showed\nthat, for the purpose of estimating losses due to internal demagnetiza-\ntion effects in a parallel plate geometry regenerator, the assumption of\na constant (average) temperature gives values of Heff/Hapl which are\nin good agreement (less than 15% error in the worst case, less that 4%\non average) with a more complex (i.e., vectorial) model that assumes\na linear temperature profile along the plates (SMITH et al., 2010).\n\nTherefore, in the present model the effective magnetic field was cal-\nculated using a simplified method that consists of assuming a linear\ntemperature profile (between TC and TH) along the regenerator bed\nand calculating an average temperature for each finite volume in the\nregenerator. Eq. (4.47) is used to calculate the local values of the ef-\nfective magnetic field at each volume, which remain unchanged along\nthe entire simulation. Numerically, Eq. (4.47) is implemented as:\n\nHeff(t,z) = Hapl(t,z) ?NDM(Hapl(t,z),T(t,z)) (4.48)\n\nand the effective magnetic flux density, Beff(t,z) = \u00b50Heff(t,z).\n\nThe total demagnetization factor of an AMR matrix, ND, comprises the\ndemagnetization factor of the matrix geometry, ND,geo, and the demag-\nnetizing factor of the casing geometry that surrounds the regenerative\nbed, ND,csg. Hence, ND was estimated using a correlation proposed for\na packed bed of particles available in (COEY, 2010):\n\nND = ND,geo + (1 ??)(ND,csg ?ND,geo) (4.49)\n\nwhere ND,csg can be estimated via relations for cylindrical and pris-\nmatic geometries proposed, respectively, by Sato and Ishii (1989) and\nAharoni (1998). Eq. (4.49) is used for particle beds, such as spheres,\nwhere the demagnetization factor of a single sphere is ND,geo = 1/3.\nFor comparison purposes, in all the remaining geometries studied in the\npresent thesis, the same equation will be used to evaluate ND. ND,geo\nwas calculated with the Sato and Ishii (1989) and Aharoni (1998) cor-\nrelations for square pins and plates, respectively.\n\n\n\n108 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\n4.4.3 Experimental Thermo-Magnetic Properties\n\nAlthough the thermo-magnetic properties of magnetocaloric materials\ncan be evaluated by means of equations of state, such as the Weiss-\nDebye-Sommerfeld (WDS) theory for materials with a continuous mag-\nnetic transition (MORRISH, 1965; DINESEN, 2004), better accuracy can\nbe achieved with interpolation curves derived from actual experimental\ndata, as discussed by Nielsen et al. (2011).\n\nThe AMR modeling benefits from the development of T-s curves\n(diagram) as a function of the magnetic flux density to calculate ?Tad\nas function of B and T . The dependence of the specific heat capacity\non B and T is also of fundamental importance, as is the character-\nization of the magnetization, M (or specific magnetization, ?), as a\nfunction of B and T to estimate the demagnetization losses. The Gd\ndensity and thermal conductivity were assumed equal to 7900 kg/m3\n\nand 10.5 W/m-K, respectively (PETERSEN et al., 2008), and therefore,\nindependent of the magnetic flux density and temperature.\n\nThe commercial-grade gadolinium used in this thesis (99% purity) was\nexperimentally characterized in terms of its specific heat capacity and\nmagnetic entropy change. The thermo-magnetic properties were mea-\nsured at magnetic flux densities between 0 and 2 T in 0.1-T intervals,\nat temperatures ranging from 250 to 320 K, in steps of 1 K. The specific\nheat and magnetization measurements as a function of temperature and\nmagnetic flux density were carried out by BASF. After processing the\ndata, non-linear interpolations were performed to correlate the data as\ncontinuous functions of the magnetic flux density and temperature. All\ninterpolating functions presented correlation coefficients R2 > 0.9999.\n\nIn the AMR model, the physical properties of Gd are calculated via\nbi-linear interpolations of tabulated data generated through the non-\nlinear interpolating functions described above. These tabulated data\nwere generated with a resolution higher than that of the original data\n(i.e., 0.01 T and 0.1 K, for the 0-2 T and 255-310 K ranges) to guarantee\nhigh accuracy. Using the bi-linear interpolations instead of the continu-\nous interpolating functions reduces the computational time. Numerical\ninstabilities are also reduced in comparison with property estimation\nusing bi-linear interpolations applied directly on the original experi-\nmental data.\n\n\n\n4.5 Numerical Implementation 109\n\nTemperature [K]\n\nE\nn\n\ntr\no\n\np\ny\n\n [\nJ\n\n/k\ng\n\n-K\n]\n\n250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nIncreasing B\n\nB = 0 T\nB = 0.3 T\nB = 0.5 T\nB = 0.7 T\nB = 1.0 T\nB = 1.2 T\nB = 1.5 T\nB = 1.7 T\n\n(a)\n\nTemperature [K]\n\n?\nT\n\na\nd\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nB = 0.3 T\nB = 0.5 T\nB = 0.7 T\nB = 1.0 T\nB = 1.2 T\nB = 1.5 T\nB = 1.7 T\n\n(b)\n\nTemperature [K]\n\nc\nH\n [\n\nJ\n/k\n\ng\n-K\n\n]\n\n250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\n280\n\n300\n\n320\n\n340\n\n360\n\nB = 0 T\nB = 0.3 T\nB = 0.5 T\nB = 0.7 T\nB = 1.0 T\nB = 1.2 T\nB = 1.5 T\nB = 1.7 T\n\n(c)\n\nTemperature [K]\n\n?\n [\n\nA\n-m\n\n2\n/k\n\ng\n]\n\n250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nB = 0 T\nB = 0.3 T\nB = 0.5 T\nB = 0.7 T\nB = 1.0 T\nB = 1.2 T\nB = 1.5 T\nB = 1.7 T\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 Interpolated thermo-magnetic properties of the gadolinium\nsamples used in this thesis as a function of temperature and magnetic\nflux density: (a) T-s diagram; (b) ?Tad; (c) Specific heat capacity; (d)\nSpecific magnetization.\n\n4.5 Numerical Implementation\n\nThe dimensionless governing equations, Eqs.

The model enables selecting different blow periods\n(?CB 6= ?HB), but in all analyses presented in this thesis identical blow\nperiods have been considered.\n\nThe solver starts with the input mass flow rate (MFR in the Fig. 4.6)\nand the cycle starts at t? = 0. Based on the input mass flow rate,\nan initial value for the amplitude of the pressure drop waveform At is\nadjusted, and Eq. (4.59) is solved. If the matrix geometry is composed\nby packed spheres or pins, there is an internal loop to compute the\nsource term linearization, for which the convergence criterion tolerance\nis 10-10. If the parallel plate geometry is selected, u?D is solved directly.\nThis procedure is repeated for all time steps until the end of the blow.\nWhen all time steps are solved, the cycle convergence is verified, which\nmeans comparing the values of u?D(t) corresponding to the current (?)\nand the previous (??1) cycles. The convergence criterion is as follows:\n\n????u?D(t?)|? ?u?D(t?)|??1\n???? &lt;10-8 (4.60)\n\nwhere ? is the cycle count. The main loop is related to the convergence\nof the input mass flow rate, for which the convergence criterion tol-\nerance is 10-10. Based on the converged solution of the instantaneous\nsuperficial velocity, u(t) = u?DuD,max is calculated from the blow (hot\nand cold) average mass flow rate and compared with the input value,\ni.e.:\n\n?????m?input ? 1?blow\n? ?blow\n\n0\n\n?fAc,Regu(t)dt\n\n????? &lt;10-10 (4.61)\n\n\n\n114 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nBegin\n\nInput MFR\n\nGeometry\n\nAdjust: At \n\nSource term \nconvergence:\n\n10-10\n\nNo\n\nSolve \nEq. 4.60\n\nBegin Cycle\nt*\n\n =\n t\n\n*  \n+\n\n ?\nt*\n\nYes\n\nEnd\n\nSpheres \nand Pins\n\nt* = ?blow/? t No\n\nCycle \nconvergence:\n\n10-8\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nVerification  \nimput MFR\n\n10-10\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSave: At \n\nYes\n\nEnd Cycle\n\nSolve \nEq. 4.60\n\nParallel \nPlates\n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Solver routine for the momentum equation.\n\n\n\n4.5 Numerical Implementation 115\n\nIf the convergence criterion is not satisfied, a new At is adjusted and the\nroutine is repeated until the input mass flow rate convergence tolerance\nis respected.\n\n4.5.2 Energy Equations\n\nThe energy equation for the fluid and solid phases, Eqs.

The boundary matrix coefficients are determined\nby energy balances on the solid phase boundaries. The coefficients\nare identical to the ones presented above, with the following changes:\nAw = 0 to Cold or West boundary volume; Ae = 0 to Hot or East\nboundary volume.\n\nTo accelerate the numerical convergence, linear temperature profiles,\ni.e., ?f,s(z\n\n? = 0) = 0 and ?f,s(z\n? = 1) = 1 were assumed as initial\n\nconditions for the fluid and solid energy equations. The solver was a\nline-by-line Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm (TDMA). This solver, also\nknown as the Thomas Algorithm, was chosen as it does not require\nan iterative processes, such as other known methods (Jacobi or Gauss-\nSeidel elimination).\n\n\n\n4.5 Numerical Implementation 119\n\nThe fluid and solid energy equations are solved coupled. This means\nthat at any given time, the fluid equation is solved first, and its solution\nis used to solve the solid energy equation before returning to the fluid\ndomain with a new solution for the solid phase. This procedure is\nrepeated until the convergence criteria are satisfied. Fig. 4.7 presents\nthe coupled solution routine.\n\nAfter the solution of the momentum equation, the cycle starts at t? = 0\nwith the initial condition. A blow is identified as cold or hot, and, for\nevery time step, the internal loop of the energy equations are solved\nuntil the convergence criterion of 10?6 is satisfied for both ?f and ?s. In\nall iterations, the fluid and solid properties are recalculated based on\nthe previous ?f and ?s solution. If the convergence criterion is satisfied,\nthe next time step is solved. After all time steps are solved, the cycle\nconvergence is verified, which consists of comparing the solutions ?f,s(t)\nfrom the current (?) and previous (? ? 1) cycles with the convergence\ncriterion as follows:\n\n?????f,s(z?, t?)|? ??f,s(z?, t?)|??1\n???? &lt;10-6 (4.73)\n\nIf the convergence criterion is not satisfied, the solver returns to the be-\nginning of the cycle, but using the previous temperature fields as initial\nconditions. This procedure is repeated until all convergence criteria are\nrespected.\n\n4.5.3 Void Volume\n\nThe implementation of the energy equation for the fluid in the void\nvolume, Eq. (4.12), is similar to that for the fluid in the porous medium,\nfor which the fully implicit scheme was used.

(4.74) is solved for the cold and hot void volumes. However, the\nboundary conditions are different, depending on the blow direction.\nUsing fictitious volumes to implement the boundary conditions, the\nmatrix coefficients are calculated as explained below.\n\n? If u? > 0 - cold blow: The fluid coming from the cold reservoir\nenters the cold void volume, flows through the regenerator and\nthrough the hot void volume, up to the hot reservoir.\n\nOn the cold side, the fluid coming from the cold reservoir enters the\ncold void volume and the fluid exiting this void volume enters the re-\ngenerator. Thus, at z? = ?L?vv, an inlet boundary condition is applied,\nin which ?\n\nC,vv\nf = ?C = 0. At z\n\n? = 0, an outflow boundary condition is\n\napplied, i.e.,\n??\n\nC,vv\nf\n\n?z?\n= 0. Here, L?vv = Lvv/LReg. The matrix coefficients\n\nare defined as follows:\n\n\n\n122 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nWest boundary volume: East boundary volume:\nAw = 0 Aw = 1\nAe = 0 Ae = 0\n\nBp = ?C = 0 Bp = 0\nAp = 1 Ap = 1\n\nOn the hot side, the fluid leaving the regenerator enters the hot void\nvolume and flows towards the hot reservoir. Thus, at z? = 1, an inlet\nboundary condition is applied, in which ?\n\nH,vv\nf = ?f|z* = 1. At z\n\n? =\n\n1 +L?vv, an outflow boundary condition is applied, i.e.,\n??\n\nH,vv\nf\n\n?z?\n= 0. The\n\nmatrix coefficients are, therefore:\n\nWest boundary volume: East boundary volume:\nAw = 0 Aw = 1\nAe = 0 Ae = 0\n\nBp = ?f|z* = 1 Bp = 0\nAp = 1 Ap = 1\n\n?

At z\n\n? = 1, an outflow boundary condition is\n\napplied, i.e.,\n??\n\nH,vv\nf\n\n?z?\n= 0.

For the hot void volume, the\ninitial condition is the temperature of the hot reservoir, ?Hvvf = ?H = 1.\nThe TDMA was also used in the void volume solver. As explained ear-\nlier, the main impact of the void volume on the regenerator behavior\nis the change of the inlet temperature during the cold and hot blows,\nwhich means that, when the void volumes are taken into account, the\nboundary conditions for Eq. (4.62), originally presented in Section 4.5.2,\nhave to be updated. Hence, when the void volumes are considered, the\nnew boundary conditions for the energy equation of the fluid phase are\ngiven by:\n\n?

The TDMA was used, but with an additional\nconvergence loop for the y direction. Thus, convergence is obtained\nwhen two successive iterations satisfy the following criterion:\n\n?????(wall,air)(t?,y?,z?)|i ??(wall,air)(t?,y?,z?)|i?1\n???? &lt;10-6 (4.76)\n\nwhere i is the current iteration and i?1 is the previous iteration.

The procedure is repeated for each time step\nuntil convergence is achieved. After that, the following parameters are\ncalculated: thermal effectiveness, pressure drop, pumping power and\nentropy generation per unit volume (to be defined in Sections 5.2 and\n7.1).\n\n? Active magnetic regenerator:\n\nThe routine starts with the evaluation of magnetic losses. Later, it is\nalso divided between the cold and hot blows. In the cold blow routine,\nthe cold void volume energy equation is calculated and its solution is\nused as the west boundary condition for the regenerator fluid phase\nmodel. Then, the MCE and q??csg are computed and incorporated in the\nsolid and fluid energy equations, respectively. Next, the fluid exiting\nthe regenerator is used as the west boundary condition for the hot void\nvolume. The hot blow routine is similar. The procedure is repeated for\neach time step until convergence is achieved. After that, the following\nparameters are calculated: cooling capacity, regenerator temperature\nspan, pressure drop, pumping power and entropy generation per unit\nvolume (to be defined in Sections 6.3 and 7.1).\n\n4.6 Numerical Mesh and Convergence\nEvaluation\n\nAn evaluation of the numerical mesh was performed based on differ-\nences between converged results for different mesh sizes and the over-\nall computing time associated with each mesh. Four different meshes\nwere evaluated: the temporal mesh, the porous medium z-direction\nmesh, the void volume z-direction mesh and the casing heat transfer\ny-direction mesh.\n\nThe porous medium heat transfer model was used to evaluate the tem-\nporal and the porous medium z-direction meshes together. In this\nanalysis, four different mesh sizes were investigated, as shown in Table\n4.5.\n\nAs presented in Table 4.5, the mesh sizes double with each mesh num-\nber. For both the passive and AMR regenerators, the mesh evaluation\n\n\n\n4.6 Numerical Mesh and Convergence Evaluation 129\n\nTable 4.5 \u2013 Porous medium heat transfer model meshes.\nMesh Temporal mesh z-direction mesh\n\n1 90 50\n2 180 100\n3 360 200\n4 720 400\n\nwas performed based on the results for several different operating con-\nditions, but only three cases were selected for the present discussion.\nAs shows in Table 4.6, Cases 1, 2 and 3 have different regenerator\nlengths and cycle frequencies to test the sensitivity of these parameters\nwith respect to the temporal and spatial mesh sizes. The remaining\nvariables of the packed bed of spheres regenerator, i.e., mass flow rate,\nparticle diameter, porosity, and cold and hot reservoirs temperatures,\nwere kept constant.\n\nTable 4.6 \u2013 Simulations cases used in the mesh evaluation.\nCase Length [mm] frequency [Hz]\n\n1 50 2\n2 100 2\n3 100 0.5\n\nFor passive regenerators, the mesh evaluation was made based on the\nthermal effectiveness, ?. Table 4.7 shows the results for the mesh evalua-\ntion for passive regenerators for Dh,Reg = 25 mm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36,\nm? = 50 kg/h, TH = 320 K and TC = 280 K. In Table 4.7, the variable\n? = 100 \u00d7 (?n ? ?n-1)/?n is the effectiveness difference between two\nconsecutive meshes, i.e., n and n?1. t is the total computational time\nfor each case.\n\nTable 4.7 \u2013 Mesh evaluation for passive regenerators.\n\nMesh\nCase 1 Case 2 Case 3\n\n? ?[%] t[s] ? ?[%] t[s] ? ?[%] t[s]\n\n1 0.951 - 12 0.970 - 43 0.950 - 18\n2 0.958 0.7 51 0.976 0.7 177 0.961 1.2 61\n3 0.960 0.3 212 0.979 0.3 743 0.967 0.6 234\n4 0.961 0.1 718 0.981 0.1 2790 0.970 0.3 857\n\nThe results for passive regenerator show that there is some improve-\nment in the effectiveness results when the mesh is refined. However,\n\n\n\n130 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nwhen the computational time, t, is evaluated, it can be concluded that\nthe improvement in the effectiveness is minor when compared with\nthe increasing computational cost. This means that Mesh 3 provides\nthe best compromise. The passive regenerator mesh evaluation can\nalso be evaluated in terms of the ideal regenerator solution available\nin Dragutinovic and Baclic (1998). Fig. 4.9 shows plots of the regen-\nerator effectiveness as a function of the NTU for the different meshes.\nThe parameters of the matrix simulated in this analysis are as follows:\nDh,Reg = 25 mm, LReg = 100 mm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36, f = 1 Hz,\nTH = 320 K and TC = 280 K. The mass flow rate was varied from 10\nto 200 kg/h. These results led to the same conclusion i.e., that Mesh 3\nappears to be the best option. The ideal regenerator simplification and\nmodel are presented and discussed in more details in Section 4.7.1.\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\nIdeal Regenerator Solution\nMesh 1 - (90 x 50)\nMesh 2 - (180 x 100)\nMesh 3 - (360 x 200)\nMesh 4 - (720 x 400)\n\nMesh\n\nT\no\n\nta\nl \nS\n\nim\nu\n\nla\nti\n\no\nn\n\n T\nim\n\ne\n [\n\ns\n]\n\n1 2 3 4\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Mesh evaluation for passive regenerators and comparison\nwith the ideal regenerator solution.\n\nFor AMRs, the mesh evaluation was carried out based on the cooling\ncapacity, Q?. Table 4.8 shows the mesh evaluation for the following\n\n\n\n4.6 Numerical Mesh and Convergence Evaluation 131\n\nparameters: Dh,Reg = 25 mm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36, m? = 50 kg/h,\nTH = 300 K and ?THex = 10 K. The instantaneous magnetic flux\ndensity was varied between 0 and 1 T. In Table 4.8 the variable ? =\n100 \u00d7 (Q?n ? Q?n-1)/Q?n is the cooling capacity difference between two\nconsecutive meshes, i.e., n and n? 1.\n\nTable 4.8 \u2013 Mesh evaluation for AMRs.\n\nMesh\nCase 1 Case 2 Case 3\n\nQ?[W] ?[%] t[s] Q?[W] ?[%] t[s] Q?[W] ?[%] t[s]\n\n1 12.2 - 57 15.5 - 190 10.9 - 58\n2 14.2 14.4 217 17.1 9.1 808 14.3 23.8 218\n3 15.2 6.6 987 17.8 3.7 3979 16.5 12.8 791\n4 15.7 3.0 2889 18.0 1.2 11168 17.3 4.9 2441\n\nThe results in Table 4.8 show that the AMR solution is more sensi-\ntive to the mesh size. Nevertheless, they also indicate that Mesh 3 is\nthe most appropriate option because a more refined mesh (Mesh 4) in-\ncreases significantly the total computational time, especially when the\nvoid volume and casing heat transfer models are solved. Moreover, the\nbenefit of using Mesh 4 is only a 4.9% improvement over Mesh 3, for\nthe worst case (Case 3).\n\nAn evaluation of the void volume z-direction and casing heat transfer\ny-direction meshes was also carried out. In order to evaluate the void\nvolume mesh, several simulations were undertaken varying the void\nvolume size and the z-direction mesh size between 10 and 200 volumes.\nThe temporal mesh had 360 time steps and the porous medium spatial\nmesh had 200 volumes. Here, only one void volume mesh analysis\nis presented, whose results were obtained considering the simulation\nconditions from Case 3 in Table 4.8, i.e., Dh,Reg = 25 mm, LReg = 100\nmm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36, f = 0.5 Hz, m? = 50 kg/h. For the\npassive regenerator tests, TH = 320 K and TC = 280 K, while for the\nAMR simulations TH = 300 K and ?THex = 10 K. The instantaneous\nmagnetic flux density was varied between 0 and 1 T. Also, a void volume\nfraction of 15% was used.\n\nThe results shown in Table 4.9 demonstrate that the passive regenerator\nsolution is less sensitive to the void volume mesh size when compared\nto the AMR solution. Additionally, the refining of the mesh size did not\nincrease significantly the computational time. Therefore, a z-direction\nmesh of 100 finite volumes was selected for the void volume.\n\n\n\n132 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nTable 4.9 \u2013 Mesh evaluation of the void volume model.\n\nMesh\nPassive AMR\n\n? ?[%] t[s] Q?[W] ?[%] t[s]\n\n10 0.955 - 216 13.9 - 827\n50 0.948 0.73 240 9.9 29.3 864\n100 0.948 0.09 255 9.2 6.2 931\n200 0.947 0.04 278 9.0 3.0 1051\n\nRegarding the casing heat transfer model, the y-direction wall mesh\nwas also evaluated based on several simulations. Considering the same\nconditions of Case 3, i.e., Dh,Reg = 25 mm, dp = 1 mm, ? = 0.36,\nm? = 50 kg/h, TH = 300 K and ?THex = 10 K, a G10 casing with a\n2-mm wall thickness and an air gap of 1 mm was simulated. These wall\nthickness and air gap dimensions are in agreement with the actual AMR\napparatus discussed in this thesis. The temporal mesh had 360 time\nsteps and the porous medium spatial mesh had 200 volumes. According\nto the results, the air layer did not require a refined mesh, so only\n5 finite volumes were used. On the other hand, the wall in contact\nwith the porous medium, where the temperature and flow velocities\nare changing continuously, requires a more refined mesh due to the\ntransient heat transfer between the porous matrix and the wall. Hence,\nthe y-direction wall mesh was evaluated for 10, 20 and 40 volumes.\n\nTable 4.10 presents the results of the mesh study for the casing heat\ntransfer modeling. Based on these results a y-direction mesh with 20\nfinite volumes was selected. In addition, the results in Table 4.10 shows\nthat the increase in the total simulation time when the casing heat\ntransfer model is included in the model cannot be neglected.\n\nTable 4.10 \u2013 Mesh evaluation to wall heat transfer model.\n\nMesh\n1 wall\n\nQ?[W] ?[%] t[s]\n\n10 14.723 - 1566\n20 14.718 0.03 2063\n40 14.717 0.01 3013\n\nIn summary, the following mesh characteristics were selected as the\nbest compromise between accuracy and computational time for both\npassive and active regenerators:\n\n\n\n4.7 Initial Model Verification 133\n\n? Temporal mesh: 360 time steps;\n\n? Regenerator z-direction mesh: 200 finite volumes;\n\n? Void volume z-direction mesh: 100 finite volumes;\n\n? Casing y-direction mesh: 20 finite volumes;\n\nIn general words, for the AMR simulations a more refined mesh would\nbe the best option. However, when the void volume and casing heat\ntransfer models are considered, the computational time increases sig-\nnificantly. Thus, smaller meshes are more appropriate for comparisons\nwith the experimental data and the generation of results in the opti-\nmization routine. The latter requires a significant number (around 10k)\nof simulated scenarios.\n\n4.7 Initial Model Verification\n\nThe initial model validation is discussed in this section. First, the ideal\npassive regenerator model is presented and compared with Dragutino-\nvic and Baclic (1998). The following parameters were changed: spheres\nsize, operating frequency, plates thickness and porosity of the parallel\nplate regenerator. Next, it is demonstrated that the built-in and dis-\ncrete implementations of the MCE give the same cooling capacity, when\na refined data set of the magnetocaloric properties are available.\n\n4.7.1 Ideal Passive Regenerator Model\n\nTo simulate the ideal regenerator behavior the simplifications discussed\nin Section 2.5 were implemented in the numerical model. This first\nverification is an important step to evaluate the iterative routine solver\nand also the mesh sensitivity analysis presented previously.\n\nThe first comparison between the ideal regenerator model and the nu-\nmerical results considers a packed bed of spheres with different particle\nsizes, i.e., dp = 0.5 mm, dp = 0.8 mm, dp = 1 mm and dp = 2 mm.\nThe operating conditions were: Dh,Reg = 25 mm, LReg = 100 mm,\n? = 0.36, f = 1 Hz, TH = 320 K and TC = 280 K. The mass flow rate\nwas varied between 10 and 200 kg/h. Fig. 4.10 plots the regenerator\neffectiveness as a function of the NTU, which varies from 5 to 750. A\n\n\n\n134 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\ngood agreement between the Dragutinovic and Baclic (1998) solution\nand the numerical model was verified, with a maximum deviation of\nabout 1.5%.\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n100 101 102 103\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\nDragutinovic and Baclic (1998)\nNumerical Solution\n\nSpheres \nf = 1 Hz\n\n dp = 0.8 mm\n dp = 1 mm\n\n dp = 0.5 mm\n\n dp = 2 mm\n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Effectiveness vs. NTU for spheres packed bed matrix\nwith different particle sizes.

The particle diameter\nwas kept fixed at 1 mm. The remaining operating conditions were\nthe same as in the first comparison.

The other operating conditions were as follows: square sectional\narea with WReg = 13 mm, LReg = 91 mm, f = 1 Hz, TH = 320 K and\nTC = 280 K.

The other operating conditions were the same\nas in the third comparison. Fig. 4.13 shows plots of the regenerator\neffectiveness as a function of the NTU, which varies between 1 and\n300.

This means that the\ncoupled solution of the energy equations for the fluid and solid phases\nwas executed correctly, the convergence tolerances were satisfactorily\nselected and the solver iterative routine was successfully implemented.\nTherefore, it is believed that the inclusion in the numerical model of\nnon-idealities such as the time-dependent properties and mass flow rate,\naxial heat conduction and viscous dissipation will result in physically\nconsistent behavior that will not depend on the numerical implemen-\ntation.\n\n\n\n4.7 Initial Model Verification 137\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n100 101 102 103\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nDragutinovic and Baclic (1998)\nNumerical Solution\n\nParallel Plates\neplate = 0.25 mm\n\n ? = 0.2\n\n ? = 0.5\n ? = 0.36\n\nFigure 4.13 \u2013 Effectiveness vs. NTU for parallel plates matrix with\ndifferent porosities.

This section compares the\ntwo different types of MCE implementation, discussed in Section 4.4.1,\nnamely the discrete and the built-in methods subjected to a contin-\nuous sinusoidal magnetic flux density waveform between 0 and 1 T.\nThe regenerator matrix dimensions are: Dh,Reg = 25 mm, LReg = 100\nmm, dp = 1 mm and ? = 0.36. The hot reservoir temperature was\nkept constant at TH = 300 K, while the reservoir temperature span\nwas allowed to vary. Five different operating conditions were evalu-\nated, changing the operating frequency and the mass flow rate. The\nutilization changed as a consequence. Table 4.11 shows the simulation\nconditions of each case.\n\nFig. 4.14 shows the numerical results for the five cases, in which the con-\n\n\n\n138 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nTable 4.11 \u2013 Operating conditions of the simulated cases to compare\nthe different MCE implementations.\n\nCase f [Hz] m?

As expected, when a refined\ndata set of the magnetocaloric properties are available, both approaches\nhave to return about the same converged results for the cooling capac-\nity, even when a continuous magnetic flux density variation is imposed.\nThese results lead to the conclusion that both MCE approaches were\nsuccessfully implemented in the AMR modeling.

The user interface was divided in different palettes to enable\neasy understanding of the type of regenerator being simulated, selection\nof materials and heat transfer fluid, operating parameters and losses\nmodeling. The RegSim interface is shown in Fig. 4.15. The simulator\nenables the following features:\n\n? Selection of the problem to be solved, i.e., momentum equation\nonly, single blow regenerator, passive regenerator or AMR;\n\n? Selection of four different regenerator matrix geometries, namely,\nspheres, pins, parallel plates and micro-channels;\n\n? Selection of three different fluid flow waveforms: instantaneous,\nsinusoidal and trapezoidal, which is characteristic of rotary valves;\n\n? Selection of five different applied magnetic field waveforms: in-\nstantaneous, sinusoidal, rectified sinusoidal (used in the present\nthesis), trapezoidal and rotor-stator.\n\n? Selection of different operating conditions, defined in terms of\nthe reservoir temperatures, operating frequencies and mass flow\nrates;\n\n? Selection of the losses models to simulate: casing heat transfer,\nvoid volume and magnetic losses.\n\nAlso, the interface enables selecting ranges of several parameters to be\nsimulated. For example, if the mass flow rate needs to be varied between\n10 and 100 kg/h, in intervals of 10 kg/h, these can be directly input via\nthe user interface so that the simulations will run sequentially. This\nis very important in the simulations carried out in the optimization\nprocedure.\n\n\n\n140 4 Problem Formulation and Solution Method\n\nM\nai\nn\u00a0\nIn\nte\nrf\nac\ne\n\nM\nag\nne\n\nti\nc\u00a0\nFi\nel\nd\u00a0\nIn\nte\nrf\nac\ne\n\nW\nal\nl\u00a0H\n\nea\nt\u00a0T\nra\nns\nfe\nr\u00a0\nIn\nte\nrf\nac\ne\n\nRe\nge\nne\n\nra\nto\nr\u00a0\nG\neo\n\nm\net\nry\n\u00a0In\nte\nrf\nac\ne\n\nM\nat\ner\nia\nl\u00a0a\nnd\n\n\u00a0M\nCE\n\nIm\npl\nem\n\nen\nta\nti\non\n\nSe\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\nSi\nm\nul\nat\nio\nn\n\nSe\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\nFigure 4.15 \u2013 RegSim - Regenerator Simulator interface.\n\n\n\n141\n\n5 Passive Thermal\nRegenerators\n\nThe study of passive regenerator is the basis to understand the heat\ntransfer, fluid flow and losses in the regenerative matrix. Addition-\nally, the experience acquired with the instrumentation and transient\nmeasurements during the passive experiments was valuable to define\nthe AMR experimental procedure. The present chapter shows the ex-\nperimental and numerical evaluation of passive thermal regenerators,\nstarting with the time dependent measurements of temperature, pres-\nsure drop and mass flow rate. Next, the data regression and the metrics\nused to evaluate the numerical and experimental results are presented.\nThe comparison between the data and numerical results is presented\nat the end of the chapter.\n\n5.1 Time-Dependent Measurements\n\nThe time-dependent measurements performed by different transducers\nare used to calculate the time-average values that characterize the main\nsystem variables. As explained in Chapter 3, in all transient measure-\nments, a total of 5 cycles with 300 data points per cycle were used\nto evaluate the time-average metrics. The transient measurements are\nexplained next.\n\n5.1.1 Temperature Measurements\n\nA passive regenerator test starts with the regenerator at a given ini-\ntial condition and the setting of the temperatures of the two thermal\n\n\n\n142 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nreservoirs. The hot and cold reservoirs were kept at 320 and 280 K,\nrespectively, in all tests. The ambient temperature was at 300 \u00b1 2 K.\nFig. 5.1 shows a typical evolution of the temperature at the cold (TCE)\nand hot (THE) ends, and the internal temperatures at different posi-\ntions (Ti1, Ti2, Ti3, Ti4 and Ti5). Having started at around 300 K, the\ntemperatures reach the periodically developed regime in a few minutes.\nIt is possible to observe the symmetry between the cold and hot sides of\nthe regenerator, which is a consequence of the well balanced operating\nconditions, i.e., equal blow periods and blow-average mass flow rates.\n\ntime [s]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\n305\n\n310\n\n315\n\n320\nTHE\n\nTi1\n\nTi2\n\nTi3\nTamb\n\nTi4\n\nTi5\n\nTCE\n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Time-dependent temperature evolution in the passive ex-\nperimental tests.\n\nIn the periodically developed regime, the last five cycles of the total\nsampling interval are selected to evaluate the time-average metrics.\nFig. 5.2 shows the last five cycles for four different tests, as presented in\nTable 5.1. Additionally, Fig. 5.3 shows the temperature profiles in these\ntests immediately after the hot blow (open symbols) and immediately\nafter the cold blow (solid symbols).\n\n\n\n5.1 Time-Dependent Measurements 143\n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Geometry and operating conditions of the experimental\ntests to evaluate the time-dependent temperature measurements.\n\nTest Casing dp [mm] ? f [Hz] NTU[-] Vpump [cm\n3]\n\nTest#1 #3 0.5 0.23 0.25 ? 650 5.07\nTest#2 #4 1 1.43 0.25 ? 40 13.90\nTest#3 #3 1 0.62 1 ? 28 13.90\nTest#4 #1 1 1.25 1 ? 14 13.90\n\nThe conditions of Test #1, Fig. 5.2(a), result in a high thermal effec-\ntiveness. Ti1 and Ti5 never get close to the reservoirs temperatures, TH\nand TC, which gives rise to almost linear temperature profiles at the\nend of the blows, as seen in Fig. 5.3. Also, the internal temperature\nreadings have sinusoidal shapes with small temperature amplitudes (of\nthe order of 5 K), which are typical of high effectiveness, as a result of\nhigh NTU matrices and low utilization conditions.\n\nConversely, the conditions of Test #2, Fig. 5.2(b), are those of a low\neffectiveness regenerator. Now, only the middle probe, Ti3, has a per-\nfect sinusoidal behavior, but with a large amplitude approaching 40 K.\nIn this case, Ti1 and Ti2 reach TH at the end of the cold blow and, sym-\nmetrically, Ti4 and Ti5 reach TC at the end of the hot blow. As a result,\nthe temperature profiles at the end of the blows are no longer linear,\nand there is a significant penetration of the constant temperature of\nthe reservoirs into the matrix, due to the large displaced fluid volumes\nin the blows associated with a large utilization factor. In this case,\nclose to 30% of the regenerator length, closer to the reservoirs, attain\nthe reservoir temperature after each blow. As a consequence, the out-\nlet blow time-dependent temperature also presents a large amplitude,\nwhich is typical of low effectiveness, resulted from low NTU matrices\nand large utilization conditions.\n\nTests #3 and #4, Figs. 5.2(c) and (d), were carried out to compare\ntwo matrices at the same operating conditions (frequency and superfi-\ncial velocity), but with different values of utilization and NTU, since\nthe Casing #1 has only half the volume of Casing #3. As expected,\nthe results show clearly the effects of utilization and interstitial heat\ntransfer area on the regenerator performance, since the results for Cas-\ning #3 are in much better agreement with the behavior expected for a\nhigh effectiveness matrix than Casing #1.\n\n\n\n144 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nt* = 2?ft\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\n305\n\n310\n\n315\n\n320\n\n2?? 3? 4? 5? 6? 7? 8? 9? 10?\n\nTHE\nTi1\n\nTi2\n\nTi3\n\nTi4\n\nTi5\n\nTCE\n\n(a)\n\nt* = 2?ft\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\n305\n\n310\n\n315\n\n320\n\n2?? 3? 4? 5? 6? 7? 8? 9? 10?\n\nTHE\nTi1\nTi2\nTi3\nTi4\n\nTi5\n\nTCE\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n5.1 Time-Dependent Measurements 145\n\nt* = 2?ft\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\n305\n\n310\n\n315\n\n320\n\n2?? 3? 4? 5? 6? 7? 8? 9? 10?\n\nTHE\nTi1\nTi2\n\nTi3\n\nTi4\n\nTi5\n\nTCE\n\n(c)\n\nt* = 2?ft\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\n305\n\n310\n\n315\n\n320\n\n2?? 3? 4? 5? 6? 7? 8? 9? 10?\n\nTHE\nTi1\nTi3\n\nTi5\n\nTCE\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Time-dependent temperature measurements: (a) Test#1;\n(b) Test#2; (c) Test#3; (d) Test#4.\n\n\n\n146 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nDimensionless Length [-]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\n305\n\n310\n\n315\n\n320\nTest#1\n\nTest#2\n\nTest#3\n\nTest#4\n\nFigure 5.3 \u2013 Axial temperature profiles after the hot blow (open sym-\nbols) and after the cold blow (solid symbols).

However, the average fluid velocity and\nthe mass flow rate increase with frequency because the fluid volume is\ndisplaced faster through the porous medium. The mass flow rate results\nin a lower NTU, which causes the temperature of the fluid exiting the\nregenerator to reach lower and lower values at the end of the cold blow\nas the frequency increases. With a fixed displaced volume, the reservoir\ntemperature penetration is very little affected by the frequency, as seen\nin Fig. 5.5(a), which shows the longitudinal temperature profiles at the\nend of the blows for the fixed utilization condition.\n\n\n\n5.1 Time-Dependent Measurements 147\n\nt* = 2?ft\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n r\ne\n\na\nd\n\nin\ng\n\n i\nn\n\n T\nH\n\nE\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n315\n\n316\n\n317\n\n318\n\n319\n\n320\n\nIncreasing\nfrequency\n\n f = 0.25 Hz\n f = 0.5 Hz\n f = 0.75 Hz\n f = 1 Hz\n f = 1.25 Hz\n f = 1.5 Hz\n f = 1.75 Hz\n f = 2 Hz\n\n? 2? 3? 4?\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n(a)\n\nt* = 2?ft\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n r\ne\n\na\nd\n\nin\ng\n\n i\nn\n\n T\nH\n\nE\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n309\n\n310\n\n311\n\n312\n\n313\n\n314\n\n315\n\n316\n\n317\n\n318\n\n319\n\n320\n\nIncreasing\nutilization\n\n ? ~ 0.11\n ? ~ 0.23\n ? ~ 0.31\n ? ~ 0.46\n ? ~ 0.62\n ? ~ 0.77\n ? ~ 0.93\n\n? 2? 3? 4?\n\nf = 0.5 Hz\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.4 \u2013 Time-dependent temperature behavior at the hot end:\n(a) Constant utilization (? 0.62) and variable frequency; (b) Constant\nfrequency (0.5 Hz) and variable utilization.\n\n\n\n148 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nDimensionless lenght [-]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\n305\n\n310\n\n315\n\n320\n f = 0.25 Hz\n f = 0.5 Hz\n f = 0.75 Hz\n f = 1 Hz\n f = 1.25 Hz\n f = 1.5 Hz\n f = 1.75 Hz\n f = 2 Hz\n\n? ~ 0.31\n\n(a)\n\nDimensionless lenght [-]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\n305\n\n310\n\n315\n\n320\n\n? ~ 0.31\n\n? ~ 0.11\n? ~ 0.23\n\n? ~ 0.47\n? ~ 0.62\n? ~ 0.78\n? ~ 0.93\n\nIncreasing \nutilization\n\nf = 0.5 Hz\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.5 \u2013 Axial temperature profiles after the hot blow (open sym-\nbols) and after the cold blow (solid symbols): (a) Constant utilization\n(? 0.31) and variable frequency; (b) Constant frequency (0.5 Hz) and\nvariable utilization.\n\n\n\n5.1 Time-Dependent Measurements 149\n\nFor the condition of Fig. 5.4(b), increasing the utilization for a constant\nfrequency means displacing a larger fluid volume through the matrix\nin the same period of time. This, at the same time as it enhances the\ninterstitial heat transfer coefficient, it also increases the reservoir tem-\nperature penetration in the matrix as a result of a higher utilization.\nThe latter effect can be perceived quite clearly in Fig. 5.5(b), which\nshows the axial temperature profiles becoming more deviated from the\nlinear behavior as the utilization increases. It is clear from Figs. 5.4(b)\nand 5.5(b) that the increase in utilization reduces significantly the ef-\nfectiveness of the regenerator.\n\n5.1.2 Mass Flow Rate Measurement\n\nThe mass flow rate is varied when the frequency or utilization are\nchanged. Fig. 5.6 shows the transient response of the Coriolis mass\nflow meter. Fig. 5.6(a) is for a constant utilization of approximately\n0.62 and a variable frequency, and Fig. 5.6(b) is for a constant frequency\nof 0.25 Hz and a variable utilization.\n\nAs explained in Chapter 3, the Coriolis mass flow meter is not capable\nof measuring fast transients. Ideally, during the cold blow period, the\nflow rate measured by the cold-side MFM should be the first top half of\nthe sinusoidal flow waveform, while the flow rate given by the hot-side\nMFM should be zero. During the hot blow, the behavior should be\nthe opposite, i.e., the cold-side MFM should read zero flow, while the\nhot-side MFM should give the last bottom half of the flow waveform\n(see Fig. 3.15). This behavior is somewhat followed at low frequencies\n(0.25 and 0.5 Hz), as can be seen in Fig. 5.6(a), but fails at frequencies\nabove 0.75 Hz, since the flow rate measurements no longer go to zero\nduring the opposite blows. It should be mentioned that the mass flow\nrate measurements are not in phase with the other transient measure-\nments, with the dephasing increasing with the frequency. In Fig. 5.6(a),\nhowever, the dephasing has been corrected.\n\nAt higher operating frequencies, the transient measurement do not\nreach the maximum instantaneous (peak) flow rate or the zero flow rate\ndue to second-order (time constant) effects in the flow meters. How-\never, the blow-average mass flow rate is still calculated with reasonable\naccuracy, as can be seen in Fig. 5.7. This figure shows the experimen-\ntal blow-average mass flow rate as a function of the reference average\nmass flow rate calculated by Eq. (3.1).

A good agreement\nis observed between the cold (solid symbols) and hot (open symbols)\nblow-average mass flow rates. The deviations between the experimen-\ntal data and the reference curve are of the order of the experimental\nuncertainty, which were observed to increase with frequency. For this\nreason, the reference value (calculated based on the system frequency\nand the piston displacement) was used to determine parameters such\nas the NTU, Redp, friction factor and pumping power. The data trend\npresented in Fig. 5.7 was observed in all other test conditions.\n\nAt low frequencies the time-dependent mass flow rate measurements are\nin agreement with the expected sinusoidal waveform.

This usually increases the experimental\nuncertainties.\n\nAs expected, the mass flow rate changes when frequency or utilization\nare changed. Thus, when either one is increased keeping the other\nconstant, the peak of the total pressure drop increases. As will be shown\nfurther ahead, these results will be used to determine the cycle-averaged\nporous medium pressure drop by subtracting the average pressure drop\nin the tubing from the blow-average total pressure drop.\n\n5.2 Performance Metrics and Data Regres-\nsion\n\nThe passive regenerator evaluation is carried out in terms of the ?-\nNTU relationship, which represents the thermal performance of the\nmatrix, and of the pressure drop, friction factor and pumping power as\na function of the Reynolds number, which quantify the viscous losses.\nBased on these metrics, the regenerative matrices can be compared.\n\nThe data regression to calculate the effectiveness is based on the time-\ndependent temperature measurements at the hot, THE, and cold, TCE,\nends. All tests were carried out under balanced flow conditions\n(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN, 1997), i.e., m?cp,f|CB =\nm?cp,f|HB. Thus, the effectiveness can be defined only as a function\nof the temperatures:\n\n? Cold blow - measured at the hot end (THE(t)):\n\n?CB =\n1\n\n?\n\n??\ni=1\n\n[(\n1\n?/2\n\n? ?/2\n0\n\nTHE(t)dt\n)\n?TC\n\nTH ?TC\n\n]\n(5.1)\n\n?

To correct for oscillations in the temperature\nreadings, the reservoir temperatures were calculated as the averages\nof the inlet constant temperatures (see Fig. 5.2). In all cases, TH =\n320 \u00b1 0.15 K and TC = 280 \u00b1 0.15 K. The differentiation between\nthe two definitions of effectiveness, i.e., of the cold blow (measured\nat the hot end) and of the hot blow (measured at the cold end), is\nan important one because even when the regenerator operates under\nbalanced flow conditions, the effectivenesses defined by Eqs. (5.1) and\n(5.2) may not be the same, generating an effectiveness imbalance, ??,\ndefined as (SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981):\n\n?? =\n?CB\n?HB\n\n(5.3)\n\nAn effectiveness imbalance greater or smaller than unity can be as-\nsociated with different physical phenomena (axial heat conduction,\ntemperature-dependent properties), which may act independently or\ncombined (TREVIZOLI et al., 2014). Also, the imbalance may be at-\ntributed to a bad regenerator assembly, as will be explained below.\n\nThe blow-averaged (hot and cold) mass flow rate, m?, is calculated by:\n\nm? =\n1\n\n?\n\n??\ni=1\n\n(\n1\n\n?/2\n\n? ?\n0\n\nm?(t)dt\n\n)\n(5.4)\n\nAnalogously, the blow-averaged total pressure drop, ?P tot, is defined\nby:\n\n? Cold blow - ?PCB(t) = PH,out(t) ?PC,in(t):\n\n?P tot,CB =\n1\n\n?\n\n??\ni=1\n\n(\n1\n\n?/2\n\n? ?/2\n0\n\n?PCB(t)dt\n\n)\n(5.5)\n\n? Hot blow - ?PHB(t) = PC,out(t) ?PH,in(t):\n\n?P tot,HB =\n1\n\n?\n\n??\ni=1\n\n(\n1\n\n?/2\n\n? ?\n?/2\n\n?PHB(t)dt\n\n)\n(5.6)\n\n\n\n156 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nThe blow-averaged total pressure drop is composed by the porous me-\ndium and the tubing average pressure drops. The tubing pressure drop,\n?P tub, includes the tubing itself, T- and Y-junctions and the empty\nregenerator housing. The porous medium average pressure drop is the\nactual frictional loss through the porous medium, ?P , and is the quan-\ntity used in the comparison with the modeling results. Thus:\n\n?P = ?P tot ? ?P tub (5.7)\n\n?P tub varies according to the geometry of the regenerator housing.\nFor instance, Casing #1 has the same housing diameter, but a shorter\nhousing length and a longer tubing length compared with Casing #3.\nCasing #4 has a smaller housing diameter, but the same housing and\ntubing lengths as Casing #3. Thus, for a precise determination of the\nporous medium average pressure drop, ?P tub was experimentally eval-\nuated via single (unidirectional) blow tests performed on all regenerator\nhousings under variable mass flow rates between 10 and 180 kg/h.\n\nThe friction factor, fD, is a non-dimensional form of the pressure drop.\nFor porous media, it can be calculated as follows, using the blow-\naveraged pressure drop as follows (KAVIANY, 1995):\n\nfD =\n?3\n\n1 ??\ndp\n?fu2\n\n?P\n\nLReg\n(5.8)\n\nThe blow-averaged pumping power required to overcome the viscous\n\nlosses of the fluid through the porous medium, W? pump, is given by:\n\nW? pump =\nm?\n\n?f\n?P (5.9)\n\nSince the regenerator operates at balanced conditions, it is expected,\n\nas will be seen, that ?P HB ? ?P CB, fD,HB ? fD,CB and W? pump,HB ?\nW? pump,CB.\n\nAll time integrations presented in this section were performed numeri-\ncally using the extended Simpson\u2019s rule (PRESS et al., 2007):\n\n\n\n5.2 Performance Metrics and Data Regression 157\n\n? tN?1\nt0\n\nf(t)dt = ?t\n\n[\n3\n\n8\nf0 +\n\n7\n\n6\nf1 +\n\n23\n\n24\nf2 + f3 + f4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\n\nfN?5 + fN?4 +\n23\n\n24\nfN?3 +\n\n7\n\n6\nfN?2 +\n\n3\n\n8\nfN?1\n\n]\n+ O\n\n(\n1\n\nN4\n\n)\n(5.10)\n\nwhere N is the total number of points used to calculate the numerical\nintegral and ?t is the time increment. N was equal to 300 for cycle-\naveraged variables and 150 points for blow-averaged variables.\n\n5.2.1 Uncertainty Analysis\n\nThe experimental uncertainties were evaluated based on the procedures\npresented in INMETRO (2003) and Holman (2006). The metrics were\ncalculated based on experimental measurements of independent vari-\nables, such as temperature, pressure and mass flow rate. Thus, the\nuncertainty of a dependent variable R (uR) is a combination of the un-\ncertainties of each independent variable (ux1,ux2,ux3, ...,uxn). Thus:\n\nuR =\n\n[(\n?R\n\n?x1\nux1\n\n)2\n+\n\n(\n?R\n\n?x2\nux2\n\n)2\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 +\n\n(\n?R\n\n?xn\nuxn\n\n)2]1/2\n(5.11)\n\nFor instance, the total blow-averaged pressure drop is a function of the\ninstantaneous pressure and time measurements, ?P tot = f(?P(t), t)\nas shown in Eqs. (5.5) and (5.6). Thus, the uncertainty related with\n?P tot is calculated by:\n\nu?Ptot =\n\n[(\n??P tot\n??P(t)\n\nu?P(t)\n\n)2\n+\n\n(\n??P tot\n?t\n\nut\n\n)2\n+\n\n(\n?sd?\n?\n\n)2]1/2\n(5.12)\n\nwhere u?P(t) = f(Pout,Pin) and ?sd is the standard deviation calcu-\n\nlated from the averaged values of ?P tot obtained in each of the five\ncycles:\n\n\n\n158 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\n?sd =\n\n???? ??\ni=1\n\n(\n?Ptot,i ? ?P tot\n\n? ? 1\n\n)2\n(5.13)\n\nAdditionally, the numerical integration is a summation (R =\n?\naixi)\n\nand the uncertainty of such a function is given by (HOLMAN, 2006):\n\nuR =\n\n[?( ?R\n?x1\n\nux1\n\n)2]1/2\n=\n[?\n\n(aiux1)\n2\n]1/2\n\n(5.14)\n\nThus, substituting Eq. (5.14) in Eq. (5.12) gives:\n\nu?Ptot =\n\n[(\n?P tot\n?\n\nu?\n\n)2\n+\n\n(\n?P tot\n?t\n\nu?t\n\n)2\n+\n\n(\n2\n\n??t\nu?u?t(?P tot)\n\n2\n\n)\n+\n\n(2??t)2\n?\n\n(aiu?P(t))\n2 +\n\n(\n?sd?\n?\n\n)2]1/2\n(5.15)\n\nwhere u? and u?t are the uncertainties of the cycle frequency (or period)\nand the time increment, respectively. These time uncertainties were\ncalculated based on the error associated with the frequency calculation\nfrom the linear potentiometer and on the stepper motor resolution.\nThe time increment, ?t, is the same used in the numerical integration\nusing Eq. (5.10). The third term in Eq. (5.15) results from the fact\nthat there is a correlation between ? and ?t, so their uncertainties are\nalso correlated. Finally, ai are the coefficients in the extended Simpson\nrule.\n\nSimilar procedures to evaluate experimental uncertainties were per-\nformed for all variables that required numerical integration. Variables\nthat did not require numerical integration, such as ??, ?P (porous me-\ndia pressure drop) and fD, had their uncertainties directly evaluated\nby Eq. (5.11).\n\nFinally, the expanded uncertainty (UR) is calculated by:\n\nUR = tsuR (5.16)\n\n\n\n5.3 Experimental Results 159\n\nwhere ts is the Student\u2019s t-distribution calculated based on the effective\nnumber of degrees of freedom and on the confidence level.\n\nThe expanded uncertainties of the experimental measurements were\npresented in Table 3.10. These were obtained from either calibration\nor from manufacturer\u2019s catalog in the following manner: (i) if UR was\nevaluated from calibration, a normal distribution is assumed, with a\n95% confidence level and infinite degrees of freedom. Hence, uR =\nUR/2; (ii) if UR was evaluated from catalog information, as suggested\nby INMETRO (2003), a rectangular distribution is assumed with 68%\nconfidence interval and, thus, uR = UR/\n\n?\n3.\n\n5.3 Experimental Results\n\n5.3.1 Reproducibility of the Experimental Results\n\nThe reproducibility of the experiments was verified by means of a pro-\ncedure consisting of the following steps:\n\n1. Disassembling of the passive apparatus and removal of the regen-\nerative matrix from the housing;\n\n2. Rebuilding of the regenerative matrix, following the step-by-step\nprocedure described in Appendix B for the packed bed of spheres;\n\n3. Reassembling of the passive apparatus, including all the instru-\nmentation;\n\n4. Execution of 32 experimental tests varying the utilization and the\noperating frequency;\n\nThe procedure was repeated three times by two different operators\n(PVT and GFP), as presented in Table 5.2. Casing #3 and 1-mm\ndiameter spheres with a porosity of 0.363 \u00b1 0.005 were used as the\nregenerative matrix. Assembly #1 was the first experimental evalua-\ntion of the passive system, for which the operator PVT was involved in\nthe assembling itself and in running tests. In Assembly #2, a second\noperator (GFP) performed the same procedure as in Assembly #1. In\na third test, Assembly #3, conducted by operator PVT, the hot and\n\n\n\n160 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nTable 5.2 \u2013 Reproducibility tests.\n\nAssembly Hot and cold reservoirs Operator\n\nAssembly#1 as designed PVT\nAssembly#2 as designed GFP\nAssembly#3 inverted PVT\n\ncold reservoirs were inverted in order to verify the thermal symmetry\nof the apparatus.\n\nFig. 5.9 shows the reproducibility tests results for the porous medium\npressure drop, ?P , as a function of Redp for the three assemblies pre-\nsented in Table 5.2. Fig. 5.9 also shows the numerical results for ?P .\nA good agreement is observed between the experimental and numerical\nresults, with similar trends for all assemblies. The deviations observed\nfor some individual points are of the order of the experimental uncer-\ntainties, which was about 2.5 kPa for all experimental points.

The imbalance may also be caused by poor assembling of the\npacked bed, such as porosities higher than 36% or an axially variable\nporosity. Trevizoli et al. (2014) presented some results for the effec-\ntiveness imbalance for three different matrices composed by stainless\nsteel, lead and gadolinium spheres. They identified a severe effective-\nness imbalance in the lead and gadolinium passive regenerators. This\nwas attributed to axial heat conduction effects and, in the case of Gd,\nalso to the specific heat capacity variation with temperature.\n\n\n\n162 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nContrary to Gd, the thermophysical properties of stainless steel are not\nstrongly dependent on temperature. As an example of the small impact\non the effectiveness, Fig. 5.11 shows the results for the effectiveness\nimbalance as a function of NTU for Casing #3 for spheres sizes of 0.5\nand 1 mm.\n\nTherefore, since all the passive regenerator experiments are highly re-\nproducible, and have only been performed using stainless steel matrices,\nthe effectiveness imbalance is expected to be around unity for all cases\nin this thesis. Hence, the effectiveness results will be represented either\nby the cold or hot blow effectiveness, since they are always very similar.\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\n? ~ 0.11\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\n? ~ 0.31\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\n? ~ 0.23\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\n? ~ 0.47\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\n? ~ 0.78\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n1.02\n\n? ~ 0.93\n\ndP = 0.5 mm\n\ndP = 1 mm\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n I\nm\n\nb\na\n\nla\nn\n\nc\ne\n\n [\n-]\n\n0 150 300 450 600 750 900 1050 1200 1350\n\nFigure 5.11 \u2013 Effectiveness imbalance as a function of NTU for Casing\n#3 with 0.5 and 1-mm stainless steel spheres.\n\n\n\n5.3 Experimental Results 163\n\n5.3.3 Packed Bed Regenerator\n\n5.3.3.1 Pressure Drop and Pumping Power\n\nThe blow-averaged porous medium pressure drop - calculated according\nto Eq. (5.7) - is shown in Fig. 5.12 as a function of Redp for three\ndifferent spheres sizes (0.5, 0.8 and 1 mm diameter) and Casings #1\nto #4. As expected for packed bed porous media, the pressure drop\nexhibits a linear trend at low Redp, which is typical of the Stokes flow\nregime at which Darcy\u2019s law is valid. At higher velocities, the pressure\ndrop deviates from Darcy\u2019s law and a parabolic behavior is observed\nwith respect to Redp (inertial regime).\n\nFor all casings, ?P is inversely proportional to the particle size. Also,\nRedp extends over longer ranges as the particle diameter increases. The\nfollowing remarks can be made considering a constant sphere diameter:\n\n1. For Casings #1, #2 and #3, both the superficial velocities and\nthe Redp ranges are the same, since the housing diameter is iden-\ntical in these casings. Therefore, the increase observed in ?P\nis due to the increasing housing length, as ?P increases linearly\nwith the regenerator length;\n\n2. Casings #3 and #4 have the same regenerator length, but the\nhousing diameter is different. Thus, the superficial velocity for\nCasing #4 is higher than in Casing #3 and, as a consequence,\nthe Redp range is longer for Casing #4. As a result, for identical\noperating conditions, i.e., displaced volume and frequency, Casing\n#4 exhibits a higher ?P associated with a higher Redp.\n\nThe blow-averaged pumping power as a function of Redp is shown in\n\nFig. 5.13. As expected, for a given Redp, the highest values of W? pump\nare related to the smaller particle diameters. Comparing the differ-\nent regenerator housings for a constant sphere diameter, the following\nconsiderations can be made:\n\n1. For Casings #1, #2 and #3, if the mass flow rate is the same, then\nRedp is also the same, but the utilization is different. This means\n\nthat W? pump only changes with ?P . In this situation, Casing #3\n\npresented the highest W? pump because of its longer regenerator\nlength;\n\n\n\n164 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\ndP = 0.5 mm\ndP = 0.8 mm\n\ndP = 1 mm\n\n(a)\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\ndP = 0.5 mm\ndP = 0.8 mm\n\ndP = 1 mm\n\n(b)\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\ndP = 0.5 mm\ndP = 0.8 mm\n\ndP = 1 mm\n\n(c)\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\ndP = 0.5 mm\ndP = 0.8 mm\n\ndP = 1 mm\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 5.12 \u2013 ?P for packed bed regenerators as a function of Redp for\nsphere sizes of 0.5, 0.8 and 1 mm: (a) Casing #1; (b) Casing #2; (c)\nCasing #3; (d) Casing #4.\n\n2.

For a fixed utilization, considering different sphere sizes, the NTU\nrange is longest for the smallest sphere diameter because of the\nlargest interstitial heat transfer area;\n\n2. For a fixed particle size and a fixed utilization, the NTU decreases\nwith the increasing mass flow rate. The higher values of NTU\nare for the lower operating frequencies, which for a constant uti-\nlization means a lower mass flow rate. In other words, increasing\nthe operating frequency decreases the NTU;\n\n\n\n5.3 Experimental Results 167\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.94\n\n0.89\n0.9\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n\n? ~ 1.04\n\n0.88\n0.89\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n\n? ~ 1.25\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.78\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.47\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n0.95\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.30\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.23\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n0.98\n\n0.99\n\n? ~ 0.15\n\ndP = 0.8 mm\ndP = 0.5 mm\n\ndP = 1 mm\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nFigure 5.15 \u2013 Casing #2: ? as a function of NTU for different values\nof sphere size and utilization.\n\n3.

Thus, 0.5-\nmm sphere matrices presented the highest ?-NTU combinations,\nwith the effectiveness approaching 98% to 99%;\n\n2. For a fixed particle size and different utilizations, the effectiveness\nrange decreases with increasing utilization due to a reduction of\nthe NTU;\n\n\n\n5.3 Experimental Results 169\n\n0.95\n0.955\n\n0.96\n0.965\n\n0.97\n0.975\n\n? ~ 0.39\n\n0.955\n0.96\n\n0.965\n0.97\n\n0.975\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.26\n\n0.94\n\n0.95\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.52\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.65\n\n0.89\n0.9\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n\n? ~ 1.08\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.72\n\n0.87\n0.88\n0.89\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n\n? ~ 1.43\ndP = 0.8 mm\ndP = 0.5 mm\n\ndP = 1 mm\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n\nFigure 5.17 \u2013 Casing #4: ? as a function of NTU for different values\nof sphere size and utilization.\n\n3. For a fixed particle size and a fixed utilization, in general, the\neffectiveness increases with increasing NTU;\n\n4. For small utilizations the effectiveness may not increase with the\nNTU due to the influence of axial heat conduction. In these\ncases, the low mass flow rate - resulting from a small pumped\nvolumes and low frequencies - gives rise to low superficial ve-\nlocities that result in small interstitial heat transfer coefficients.\nThus, the interphase convection and axial conduction heat fluxes\nare comparable in magnitude, reducing the effectiveness associ-\nated with the regenerator and even increasing the NTU. This is\nmore visible for the smallest sphere diameter, 0.5 mm, for which\n\n\n\n170 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nthe effectiveness is approximately constant or decreases as NTU\nincreases. For the 1-mm spheres, the effectiveness first increases\nwith the NTU, but later decreases, as the axial heat conduction\nbecomes more important. In addition, the effect of axial heat con-\nduction is more noticeable as the casing length becomes shorter,\nlike in Casing #1.\n\n5. The differentiation between the effectivenesses related to the three\nsphere sizes becomes more evident at low utilizations and larger\nvalues of NTU. As the NTU decreases, the results for the three\nsphere sizes tend to converge into a single ?-NTU curve, but the\n0.5-mm spheres always have higher ?-NTU values when compared\nwith the other particle diameters.\n\nIn an evaluation specifically for the smallest pumped volume (2.53 cm3),\nwhich corresponded to the smallest utilization for each casing, the fol-\nlowing effectiveness ranges were found:\n\n? Casing#1: ? ? 0.23 ? 94.5% &lt;? &lt;97.5%;\n\n? Casing#2: ? ? 0.15 ? 96.5% &lt;? &lt;98.5%;\n\n? Casing#3: ? ? 0.11 ? 97% &lt;? &lt;98.5%;\n\n? Casing#4: ? ? 0.26 ? 95.5% &lt;? &lt;97.5%;\n\nFor Casings #1, #2 and #3, the superficial velocity and Redp are\nthe same for a given particle diameter. In this case, the differences\nin effectiveness are related to the different utilization values for the\nthree matrices. Also, the shorter matrices are more susceptible to axial\nheat conduction losses. Nevertheless, the effectiveness values are of\nthe same order, but the shorter matrices have lower viscous losses.\nComparing Casings #1 and #4, the ?-NTU and the utilization ranges\nare approximately the same. However, in Casing #4 the axial heat\nconduction is less important, but the viscous losses are higher than in\nCasing #1.\n\n\n\n5.3 Experimental Results 171\n\n5.3.3.3 Effectiveness: Effect of Regenerator Housing Dimen-\nsions\n\nFigs. 5.18 to 5.20 show the effectiveness as a function of NTU for the\ndifferent regenerator housings considering nearly constant utilizations,\nfor the sphere diameters of 0.5, 0.8 and 1 mm, respectively. In this case,\nto fix the utilization, different fluid volumes were pumped considering\nthe different regenerator sizes. For example, for ? ? 0.23, in Casings\n#1 and #4, the displaced volume was 2.53 cm3, while for Casings\n#2 and #3 it was 3.80 cm3 and 5.07 cm3, respectively. Hence, for the\nsmaller regenerators, in terms of the total matrix mass, always a smaller\namount of fluid was displaced to achieve about the same utilization.\n\n0.93\n\n0.94\n\n0.95\n\n0.96\n\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.93\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.94\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.94\n\n0.95\n0.955\n\n0.96\n0.965\n\n0.97\n\nCsg4 -  ?  ~ 0.72\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.78\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.78\n\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\nCsg4 -  ?  ~ 0.65\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.62\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.62\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.62\n\n0.95\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n0.98\n\nCsg4 -  ?  ~ 0.52\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.47\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.47\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.46\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n0.98\n\n0.99\n\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.31\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.30\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.34\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n0.98\n\n0.99\n\nCsg4 -  ?  ~ 0.26\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.23\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.23\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.23\n\n0.9\n\n0.92\n\n0.94\n\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 1.25\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 1.25\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n\nFigure 5.18 \u2013 dp = 0.5 mm: ? as a function of NTU for different\nregenerator casings.\n\n\n\n172 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\n0.89\n0.9\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.93\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.94\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.94\n\n0.93\n\n0.94\n\n0.95\n\n0.96\n\nCsg4 -  ?  ~ 0.72\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.78\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.78\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\nCsg4 -  ?  ~ 0.65\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.62\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.62\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.62\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\nCsg4 -  ?  ~ 0.52\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.47\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.47\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.46\n\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.31\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.30\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.34\n\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n0.99\n\nCsg4 -  ?  ~ 0.26\nCsg3 -  ?  ~ 0.23\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 0.23\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 0.23\n\n0.86\n\n0.88\n\n0.9\n\n0.92\n\nCsg2 -  ?  ~ 1.25\nCsg1 -  ?  ~ 1.25\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n\nFigure 5.19 \u2013 dp = 0.8 mm: ? as a function of NTU for different\nregenerator casings.\n\nIn an ideal regenerator, for a fixed utilization and independently of the\nhousing size, the results would lead to the same ?-NTU curve.

All matrices presented exhibited high values of effectiveness, which\nis a typical feature of oscillating flow packed bed regenerators\n(SCHMIDT; WILLMOTT, 1981; ACKERMANN, 1997). The smallest\nvalues were found for Casing #1 with a sphere diameter of 1 mm\nand ? ? 1.25;\n\n2. Smaller particle diameters are associated with the highest ?-NTU\nvalues, but are more susceptible to axial heat conduction losses\nat small utilizations, and higher viscous losses at high flow rates;\n\n3. The smallest aspect ratio regenerator housing, Casing #1, for a\nfixed utilization, was the least effective matrix, but presented the\nlowest viscous losses;\n\n4. Casing #4, the highest aspect ratio matrix, was directly com-\npared with Casings #2 and #3. However, no significant effec-\ntiveness improvement was verified. Additionally, Casing #4 was\nthe worst casing in terms of viscous losses;\n\n5. Casings #2 and #3 were the most thermally effective matrices,\nshowing a very good agreement with each other at the highest\nvalues of ?-NTU for a fixed utilization. However, Casing #2 pre-\nsented lower viscous losses than Casing #3 because of its shorter\nlength.\n\nIn conclusion, with regard to the thermal effectiveness, axial conduc-\ntion and viscous losses, high aspect ratio regenerators do not seem to\nbe the best configuration. On the other hand, too short regenerators\nmay increase the axial conduction losses and are associated with the\nsmallest NTU ranges. Moreover, there seems to be an optimal rela-\ntionship between dp, Dh,reg and LReg for a given operating condition\ndictated by the mass flow rate and frequency, that guarantees a high\neffectiveness with minimal axial heat conduction and viscous losses, as\nwill be discussed later.\n\n\n\n5.3 Experimental Results 175\n\n5.3.4 Pins, Plates and Spheres: A Regenerative\nMatrix Comparison\n\nFig. 5.21 shows the pressure drop and pumping power associated with\nthe different passive matrix geometries presented in Table 3.8. As dis-\ncussed previously, the different matrices were designed to have approx-\nimately the same particle diameter and porosity so that the porous me-\ndium hydraulic diameter and the heat transfer area are approximately\nthe same for all geometries. The following remarks can be made about\nthe results shown in Fig. 5.21:\n\n1. At low Reynolds number, in the viscous (Darcian) regime, the\ndifferences in pressure drop or pumping power among the three\ngeometries are minimal;\n\n2. As expected, the plates present a linear pressure drop as a func-\ntion of the Reynolds number, characteristic of the Darcian flow\nregime;\n\n3. The packed bed of spheres shows the highest viscous losses, es-\npecially at higher velocities, where the microscopic inertial forces\nbecome more significant;\n\n4. The pressure drop of the pin array also presents a quadratic\ndependence on the Reynolds number, however, it is clear that\nthe microscopic inertial force is weaker when compared with the\npacked bed of spheres;\n\n5. For the pumping power, at the same Redp, the parallel plate\nregenerator has the lowest viscous losses, while the bed of spheres\nshows the worst pumping power performance among the three\ngeometries.\n\nFig. 5.22 shows the behavior of ? as a function of NTU and utilization\nfor the three matrix geometries. Based on these results, the following\nconclusions can be drawn:\n\n1. Since the total heat transfer area is approximately the same for\nall geometries, for a given mass flow rate, the NTU depends only\non the interstitial convective heat transfer coefficient;\n\n\n\n176 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nSpheres \nPins\nPlates\n\n(a)\n\nRedp [-]\n\nP\nu\n\nm\np\n\nin\ng\n\n P\no\n\nw\ne\n\nr \n[W\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nPlates\nPins\nSpheres\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.21 \u2013 Viscous losses of the different matrix geometries: (a) ?P\n\nas a function of Redp; (b) W? pump as a function of Redp.\n\n\n\n5.3 Experimental Results 177\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.39\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.65\n\n0.88\n0.9\n\n0.92\n0.94\n\n? ~ 0.80\n\n0.88\n0.9\n\n0.92\n0.94\n\n? ~ 0.72\n\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.26\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.52\n\n0.8\n0.82\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n\n? ~ 1.43\n\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n0.92\n\n? ~ 1.08\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\nPins\nPlates\n\nSpheres\n\nFigure 5.22 \u2013 ? as a function of NTU and utilization for different re-\ngenerator geometries.\n\n2. At the smallest values of utilization: (i) the parallel plate geome-\ntry encompasses a broader range of NTU because its convective\nheat transfer coefficient is constant (disregarding the entrance ef-\nfects) and, at some operating conditions, is higher than the con-\nvective coefficient of the remaining geometries; (ii) the pin array\nmatrix exhibited a slightly higher effectiveness, which can be asso-\nciated with the smaller axial heat conduction losses characteristic\nof this matrix. It is worth pointing out that there is no point of\ncontact between adjacent pins, which reduces the importance of\n\n\n\n178 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nheat conduction in the matrix;\n\n3. For intermediate values of utilization, the thermal performance\nof all matrices is very similar, especially for NTU > 25, which\ncorresponds to the smallest mass flow rates or superficial veloc-\nities. Considering the same operating conditions, the values of\nNTU for the parallel plate geometry cover wider ranges for each\nutilization, but these ranges decrease faster than in the other\ngeometries, due to the approximately constant convection heat\ntransfer coefficient;\n\n4. At the highest values of utilization, the thermal performance of\nthe packed bed of spheres is better than that of the other ge-\nometries. The parallel plates showed the worst performance at\nthese operating conditions. This may be associated with the high\ninterstitial heat transfer coefficients for pins and spheres, and to\nthe fluid mixing due induced by the tortuosity of the packed bed.\n\nWith regard to the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the different matrix\ngeometries, it can be concluded that, at the smallest flow rates, where\nthe viscous losses are similar for all matrices, the pin array showed the\nbest performance since it is less affected by axial heat conduction. On\nthe other hand, all geometries presented, in general, equivalent thermal\nperformances (?-NTU), with the parallel plates being characterized\nby the smallest viscous losses. For the highest values of utilization,\nthe packed spheres showed the best thermal performance, but at the\nexpense of the highest values of pressure drop and pumping power.\n\n5.4 Numerical Results\n\n5.4.1 Packed Bed Regenerator\n\nFig. 5.23 presents comparisons between experimental data and numer-\nical results for ?P as a function of Redp for different sphere sizes and\nregenerator housings.\n\nThe numerical results predicted the experimental data very well, with\ndeviations of the order of the experimental uncertainties (\u00b1 2.5 kPa).\nThe sensitivity of the experimental results with respect to the particle\n\n\n\n5.4 Numerical Results 179\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nExperimental - dP = 0.5 mm\n\nExperimental - dP = 1 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 0.5 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 1 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 0.8 mm\nExperimental - dP = 0.8 mm\n\n(a)\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nExperimental - dP = 0.5 mm\n\nExperimental - dP = 1 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 0.5 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 1 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 0.8 mm\nExperimental - dP = 0.8 mm\n\n(b)\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nExperimental - dP = 0.5 mm\n\nExperimental - dP = 1 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 0.5 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 1 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 0.8 mm\nExperimental - dP = 0.8 mm\n\n(c)\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nExperimental - dP = 0.5 mm\n\nExperimental - dP = 1 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 0.5 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 1 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 0.8 mm\nExperimental - dP = 0.8 mm\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 5.23 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical results and the exper-\nimental data: ?P as a function of Redp for packed beds with spheres\nof different sizes: (a) Casing #1; (b) Casing #2; (c) Casing #3; (d)\nCasing #4.\n\nsize and regenerator dimensions, i.e., length and diameter, was repro-\nduced satisfactorily by the model, which leads to the conclusion that\nthe closure relationships for the permeability and constant proposed by\n(ERGUN, 1952) are valid for the present experimental conditions.\n\nOther important conclusions can be drawn regarding the friction factor.\nIf the permeability and Ergun constant are valid for the regenerative\nmatrix, the friction factor should depend only on Redp, independently\nof the particle diameter, housing dimensions or operating condition.\n\n\n\n180 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nFig. 5.24 contains all results for ?P shown in Fig. 5.23, in the non-\ndimensional form of the friction factor as a function of Redp.\n\nRedp [-]\n\nf D\n [\n\n-]\n\n100 101 102 103\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\ndP = 0.5 mm\n\ndP = 0.8 mm\n\ndP = 1 mm\nRed - Casing 1\nBlue - Casing 2\nBlack - Casing 3\nGreen - Casing 4\n\n Numerical\n\nFigure 5.24 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical results and the ex-\nperimental data: fD as a function of Redp for packed beds of spheres.\n\nThe fD as a function of Redp experimental data exhibited the expected\ntrend: (i) all the results collapsed into a single curve; (ii) as explained\nbefore, at low Redp, where Darcy\u2019s law is valid, a linear trend is ob-\nserved; (iii) as Redp increases, the fD trend deviates from the linear\nbehavior.

as a function of NTU for Casing #3 and dp = 1\nmm.\n\n\n\n190 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nFirstly, the discussion will be based on the results for Casings #1, #2\nand #3. Casing #4 followed basically the same general trends of the\nother casings. However, its results, particularly for dp = 0.8 mm, will be\ndiscussed later, in the context of a direct comparison with the parallel\nplate and pin array geometries.\n\nThe simulations that did not take the void volume model into account\nalways overestimated the experimental results. On the other hand, the\nsimulations that considered this type of leakage loss were in much bet-\nter agreement with the experimental data. In particular, the following\ncomments can be made: (i) for all cases, the experimental and numer-\nical ?-NTU results presented the same trend; (ii) The model was able\nto reproduce the sensitivity of the experimental data with respect to\nthe sphere size and housing dimensions; (iii) the differences between\nthe simulations with and without the void volumes are greater at small\nvalues of utilization (small pumped volumes). This was somewhat ex-\npected, since a considerable fraction of the pumped volume becomes\ntrapped in the void space. As the displaced volume is increased, this\nfraction is reduced and the penalties associated with the void volume\nbecome less important.\n\nFor a more specific evaluation, Fig. 5.34 shows comparisons between the\nexperimental and numerical time-dependent temperature results with\n(? 6= 0) and without (? = 0) the void volumes evaluated at the cold\nand hot ends. The results are for Casing #3, dp = 0.8 mm, ? ? 0.467\nand different operating frequencies.\n\nWhen no void volume is considered, the model predicts that the re-\nturning fluid stream will be at the reservoir temperature followed by\nan abrupt variation of the temperature signal. In the case of the hot\nend, if t? > ? the inlet stream is at 320 K. This is different from the\nactual experimental temperature measurement shown in Fig. 5.34. On\nthe other hand, when the void volume is considered, the returning fluid\nstream is firstly at the temperature of the fluid trapped in the void\nspace and, only later, at the reservoir temperature. The fluid trapped\nin the hot-side void volume is at a temperature lower than that of the\nhot reservoir because it does not interact thermally with the reservoir.\nThus, the time-dependent temperature signal from the model includ-\ning the void volumes deviates from the zero void volume results, and\na larger amplitude of the temperature signal is observed, which results\nin a lower thermal effectiveness. This behavior of the mathematical\nmodel agrees well with the experimental measurements and confirms\n\n\n\n5.4 Numerical Results 191\n\nt* = 2?ft [-]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n315\n\n315.5\n\n316\n\n316.5\n\n317\n\n317.5\n\n318\n\n318.5\n\n319\n\n319.5\n\n320\n\n320.5\n\n? 2? 3? 4? ? 2? 3? 4? ? 2? 3? 4?\n\nf = 0.5Hz\n\nHot End\n\nf = 0.25Hz\n\n  Experimental\n Numerical -  = 0\n Numerical -   0\n\nf = 1Hz\n\nt* = 2?ft [-]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n279.5\n\n280\n\n280.5\n\n281\n\n281.5\n\n282\n\n282.5\n\n283\n\n283.5\n\n284\n\n284.5\n\n285\n\n? 2? 3? 4? ? 2? 3? 4? ? 2? 3? 4?\nf = 0.25Hz\n\n  Experimental\n Numerical -  = 0\n Numerical -   0\n\nf = 0.5Hz\n\nCold End\n\nf = 1Hz\n\nFigure 5.34 \u2013 Comparison of the experimental and numerical time-\ndependent temperatures with (? 6= 0) and without (? = 0) the void\nvolumes for Casing #3, dp = 0.8 mm, ? ? 0.467 and different operating\nfrequencies; at the hot end (top) and at the cold end (bottom).\n\n\n\n192 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nthe suitability of the numerical modeling of the void volume, for de-\nscribing with good precision the actual behavior of the time-dependent\ntemperature and the thermal effectiveness in real regenerators.\n\nFig. 5.35 presents comparisons between the experimental and numerical\n(with void volume) time-dependent temperatures at the hot end as a\nfunction of the utilization. As can be seen, the model does a good job\nat predicting the experimental data for the high values of utilization.\nHowever, the model under-predicts the temperatures for the lowest\nutilizations (0.11 and 0.23). It is believed that this underestimation of\nthe experimental results can be caused by the no flow period associated\nwith the small pumped volumes. As seen in Fig. 5.6(c), the no flow\nperiod was significant for the flow conditions.\n\nt* = 2?ft [-]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n310\n\n312\n\n314\n\n316\n\n318\n\n320\n\n??/2 3?/2 2?\n\n ? ~ 0.11\n ? ~ 0.23\n ? ~ 0.31\n ? ~ 0.47\n ? ~ 0.62\n ? ~ 0.78\n ? ~ 0.93\n\nFigure 5.35 \u2013 Prediction of the time-dependent experimental temper-\nature by the numerical model (continuous lines) considering the void\nvolume for Casing #3, dp = 0.8 mm, f = 0.5 Hz and different values\nof utilization.\n\nAs seen in this section, the numerical model with the void volume was\ncapable of reproducing the thermal effectiveness for intermediate and\n\n\n\n5.4 Numerical Results 193\n\nhigh values of utilization with deviations of the order of 1%.

Regarding the spheres and pin array matrices, the model\ncaptured the very similar behavior of these two geometries: (i) at low\nRedp, Darcy regime, the ?P and fD for the pins are both sightly higher\nthan those for the bed of spheres, which can be due to the lower perme-\nability of the pins porous medium. (ii) at high Redp, the microscopic\ninertial force of the pin array is weaker compared with that of the bed\nof spheres. This way, the suitability of the closure relationships for the\npermeability and Ergun constant for parallel plates and pin arrays is\nalso verified.\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nExperimental - Spheres\n\nExperimental - Pins\n\nExperimental - Plates\n\nNumerical - Spheres\n\nNumerical - Pins\n\nNumerical - Plates\n\nFigure 5.41 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical results and the exper-\nimental data: ?P as a function of Redp for different matrix geometries.\n\n\n\n5.4 Numerical Results 197\n\nRedp [-]\n\nf D\n [\n\n-]\n\n50 100 150 200\n10-1\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\nfD_HB\n\nfD_CB\n\nfD_HB\n\nExperimental - Spheres\n\nExperimental - Pins\n\nExperimental - Plates\n\nNumerical - Spheres\n\nNumerical - Pins\n\nNumerical - Plates\n\n5\n\nFigure 5.42 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical results and the exper-\nimental data: fD as a function of Redp to different matrix geometries.\n\nFigs. 5.43 to 5.45 show comparisons between the numerical model and\nthe experimental data for ? as a function of NTU and utilization for\nthe three basic geometries (0.8-mm spheres, plates and pins).\n\nAs expected, the numerical results for the packed spheres presented\na good agreement with the experimental data. The model also rep-\nresented fairly well the effectiveness results for the parallel plate and\npin matrices. The following general comments can be made: (i) for\nlow utilizations the numerical results underestimated the experimental\ndata, which can be associated with the no flow period, but the general\ntrend of the ?-NTU relationship is picked up by the model; (ii) as the\nutilization increases, the model describes well the experimental values\nand the ?-NTU curve trend. On the other hand, for the largest values\nof the utilization, the model for plates and pins overestimates the ex-\nperimental data. In summary, the majority of modeling results agreed\nfairly well with the experimental data, with deviations of the order of\n2 to 3% for the lowest and highest utilization values.\n\n\n\n198 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\nThe good agreement between the experimental data and numerical re-\nsults leads to the following conclusions: (i) the parallel plates and pin\narrays were successfully assembled based on the procedure presented\nin Appendix B, and flow maldistribution, common in parallel plate ge-\nometries, was not verified; (ii) the model may have some limitations\nat high mass flow rates and high utilizations; (iii) but the closure re-\nlations used for parallel plates and pin arrays seemed to have been\nsatisfactorily selected.\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.52\n\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n0.99\n\n? ~ 0.26\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n0.99\n\n? ~ 0.39\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.65\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.72\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.80\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n\n? ~ 1.08\n\n0.87\n0.88\n0.89\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n\n? ~ 1.43\n\nExperimental\nNumerical - No Void Volume\nNumerical - Void Volume\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\nFigure 5.43 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical results and the exper-\nimental data: ? as a function of NTU for the packed bed regenerator -\nCasing #4 and dp = 0.8 mm.\n\n\n\n5.4 Numerical Results 199\n\n0.78\n0.8\n\n0.82\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n\n? ~ 1.43\n\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.80\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.52\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.26\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.39\n\n0.88\n0.9\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.65\n\n0.88\n0.9\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.72\n\n0.82\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n\n? ~ 1.08\n\nExperimental\nNumerical - No Void Volume\nNumerical - Void Volume\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\nFigure 5.44 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical results and the exper-\nimental data: ? as a function of NTU for the parallel plate regenerator.\n\n\n\n200 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n\n? ~ 1.43\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.52\n\n0.94\n\n0.96\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\n? ~ 0.26\n\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n1\n\n? ~ 0.39\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.65\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.72\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.80\n\n0.88\n0.9\n\n0.92\n0.94\n\n? ~ 1.08\n\nExperimental\nNumerical - No Void Volume\nNumerical - Void Volume\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\nFigure 5.45 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical results and the ex-\nperimental data: ? as a function of NTU for the pin array regenerator.\n\n\n\n5.5 Void Volume and Inlet Flow Maldistribution 201\n\n5.5 Void Volume and Inlet Flow Maldistri-\nbution\n\nThe presence of a void volume imposes changes on the boundary condi-\ntions for the thermal balance in the regenerator matrix that are respon-\nsible for decreasing the heat transfer effectiveness. Hence, it becomes\nintuitive that the regenerator performance improves as the void volume\nbecomes smaller and, in a limiting situation, a regenerator without void\nvolumes will have the best performance. Fig. 5.46 shows the numerical\nresults for ? as a function of NTU for Casing #1 with 1-mm spheres and\ndifferent void volumes fractions, as presented in Tab. 3.6. The numeri-\ncal results somehow reproduced the expected behavior: (i) by decreas-\ning the void volume size the effectiveness has improved, approaching\nthe results for the zero void volume regenerator; (ii) by increasing the\nutilization, the void volume impact is reduced because the fraction of\nthe total pumped volume trapped in the void space becomes smaller.\n\nIn order to characterize experimentally the results shown in Fig. 5.46,\nexperimental tests were performed using the same porous matrix, but\nchanging the R-T adapter to decrease the void volume size, as presented\nin Fig. 3.18 and Table 3.6. 1-mm spheres were used in the tests carried\nout using Casings #1, #2 and #3. The results for ? as a function of\nNTU for these casings are presented in Figs. 5.47 to 5.49.\n\nConsidering the same regenerator housing used in the numerical model,\nFig. 5.46, the experimental results shown in Fig. 5.47 exhibit an oppo-\nsite behavior, i.e., by decreasing the void volume size, the regenerator\neffectiveness is reduced. The same behavior was observed in Casing\n#2. In Casing #3, the effectiveness reduction was smaller, but defi-\nnitely no improvement of the effectiveness was observed, as predicted\nby the model.\n\nThe reduction of the regenerator effectiveness can be explained by a\nmaldistribution of the inlet flow through the regenerator. When the\nvoid volume is reduced, the diverging angle of the inlet R-T adapter\nbecomes smaller, approaching the shape of a sudden expansion. Thus,\nwith the abrupt variation in cross sectional area, like in R-T Adapter\n#3, an abrupt change in average flow velocity is produced. As a result,\na flow recirculation region is created inside the matrix, near the inlet.\nThe fluid in this recirculation region does not interact effectively with\nthe inlet stream, which acts as an internal void space that reduces the\n\n\n\n202 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.23\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.34\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n0.87\n0.88\n0.89\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n\n? ~ 0.94\n\n No Void Volume\n Adapter #1 - * ~ 14.50%\n Adapter #2 - * ~ 11.20%\n Adapter #3 - * ~ 7.66%\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.46\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n? ~ 0.46\n\n? ~ 0.23\n\n? ~ 0.34\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n? ~ 0.46\n\n? ~ 0.34\n\n? ~ 0.23\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n? ~ 0.34\n\n? ~ 0.23\n\n? ~ 0.94\n\n? ~ 0.46\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\n\nFigure 5.46 \u2013 Numerical results for ? as a function of NTU for Casing\n#1 with 1-mm spheres and different void volume fractions.\n\n0.86\n0.87\n0.88\n0.89\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n\n? ~ 0.94\n\nAdapter #1 - * ~ 14.50%\n\nAdapter #2 - * ~ 11.20%\nAdapter #3 - * ~ 7.66%\n\n0.88\n0.89\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.23\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.46\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.34\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n\nFigure 5.47 \u2013 Casing #1 experimental results for ? as a function of\nNTU for different void volume sizes.\n\n\n\n5.5 Void Volume and Inlet Flow Maldistribution 203\n\n0.85\n0.86\n0.87\n0.88\n0.89\n\n0.9\n0.91\n\n? ~ 1.25\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.23\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.30\n\n0.87\n0.88\n0.89\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n\n? ~ 1.04\n\nAdapter #1 -  * ~ 9.67%\n\nAdapter #2 -  * ~ 7.44%\n\nAdapter #3 -  * ~ 5.10%\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n\nFigure 5.48 \u2013 Casing #2 experimental results for ? as a function of\nNTU for different void volume sizes.\n\n0.9\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n\n? ~ 0.93\n\n0.94\n\n0.95\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.31\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.47\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n\n? = 0.78\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160\n\nAdapter #1 - * ~ 7.25%\n\nAdapter #2 - * ~ 5.58%\n\nAdapter #3 - * ~ 3.82%\n\nFigure 5.49 \u2013 Casing #3 experimental results for ? as a function of\nNTU for different void volume sizes.\n\n\n\n204 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\ntotal heat transfer area and the effective thermal mass of the matrix. As\na result, the heat transfer effectiveness decreases. Also, the void region\ncreates internal gradients in the transverse direction. The 1-D model\napproach is not capable of simulating these losses because they involve\ntwo-dimensional effects related to the fluid flow and heat transfer.\n\nThe inlet flow maldistribution imposes heavier penalties on shorter ma-\ntrices, such as Casing #1, as the length fraction of the recirculation\nregion is larger. In longer matrices, such as Casing #3, the influence of\nthe flow maldistribution is smaller, as can be seen in Fig. 5.49. How-\never, this was not sufficient to improve the performance in comparison\nwith a regenerator with a larger void volume.\n\nThere still remains the question about what the results would be if a\nzero void volume regenerator was evaluated. Lozano (2015) proposed\na regenerator housing with a round rectangular cross sectional area,\nin which the inlet and outlet streams are different, as can be seen in\nFig. 3.19. This geometry guarantees a zero void volume but the inlet\nflow tubing is similar to R-T Adapter #3. Using this casing geometry\n(Casing #7), two different packed bed matrices were characterized ex-\nperimentally, one with 0.5 and another with 1 mm spheres. The results\nfor the two spheres are presented in Figs. 5.50 and 5.51, respectively.\nThe experimental results are compared with the numerical model con-\nsidering a zero void volume. Fig. 5.52 presents the experimental results\nfor ?P as a function of Redp for Casing #7 and a comparison with the\nnumerical model.\n\nAs can be seen in Figs. 5.50 and 5.51, there are considerable differences,\nas high as 7%, between the numerical and experimental effectiveness\nresults. These discrepancies in the thermal effectiveness can also be at-\ntributed to the inlet flow maldistribution. The design of Casing #7 gave\nrise to recirculation regions near the flow inlet, creating a large ther-\nmally inactive region, which reduced the effective heat transfer area,\nalso creating internal temperature gradients transversal to the flow di-\nrection. In addition, due to the two-dimensional nature of the flow,\nthe one-dimensional momentum equation does not adequately repre-\nsent this regenerator configuration. As a result, the variation of ?P\nwith Redp was under-predicted by the model. In summary, the design\ngeometry chosen for Casing #7, albeit having a zero void volume, dete-\nriorated the regenerator thermal performance and increased the viscous\nlosses.\n\n\n\n5.5 Void Volume and Inlet Flow Maldistribution 205\n\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n\n? ~ 1.36\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n1\n\n? ~ 0.20\n\n0.92\n\n0.94\n\n0.96\n\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.30\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.40\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.50\n\n0.88\n0.9\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n\n? ~ 1.09\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.82\n\nExperimental \nNumerical Results\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nFigure 5.50 \u2013 Experimental data and numerical results for ? as a func-\ntion of NTU for the zero void volume regenerator: Casing #7 with\n0.5-mm spheres.\n\n\n\n206 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\n0.8\n0.82\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n0.92\n\n? ~ 1.36\n\n0.88\n0.9\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n1\n\n? ~ 0.20\n\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.40\n\n0.88\n0.9\n\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n1\n\n? ~ 0.30\n\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.50\n\n0.82\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n\n? ~ 1.09\n\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.82\n\nExperimental \nNumerical Results\n\nNTU [-]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225\n\nFigure 5.51 \u2013 Experimental data and numerical results for ? as a func-\ntion of NTU for the zero void volume regenerator: Casing #7 with\n1-mm spheres.\n\n\n\n5.5 Void Volume and Inlet Flow Maldistribution 207\n\nRedp [-]\n\n_\n_\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n?\nP\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nExperimental - dP = 0.5 mm\n\nExperimental - dP = 1 mm\n Numerical - dP = 0.5 mm\n\n Numerical - dP = 1 mm\n\nFigure 5.52 \u2013 Experimental data and numerical results for ?P as a\nfunction of Redp for the zero void volume regenerator.\n\n\n\n208 5 Passive Thermal Regenerators\n\n\n\n209\n\n6 Active Magnetic\nRegenerators\n\nThe present chapter discusses the experimental and numerical evalua-\ntions of active magnetic regenerators, starting with some preliminary\nresults, for which the influence of the ambient and magnet temper-\nature on the regenerator temperature span is quantified. Next, the\ntime-dependent measurements, the performance metrics and the uncer-\ntainty analysis required for the data regression are presented. Later,\nthe results for the AMR performance metrics are discussed based on\nexperimental results for a sphere packed bed matrix. The experimen-\ntal data are compared with the numerical results, where the different\ntypes of losses are identified. Finally, comparisons are made between\nthe parallel plate, pin array and packed bed geometries based on the\nperformance metrics for AMRs.\n\n6.1 Preliminary Tests\n\nBefore starting the description of the main results and the evaluation\nof the AMR performance, a preliminary experimental characterization\nwas carried out. In these tests, the cold side of the AMR apparatus\nwas modified (see Fig. 3.4), in which the entire cold side instrumen-\ntation, including the pressure transducers, mass flow meter, cold heat\nexchanger and heater, was replaced by a single tube in which only tem-\nperature readings were performed. The single tube linked directly the\ncold end of the regenerator to the double effect pump. Thus, the fluid\nthat exits the cold end of the regenerator during the hot blow is trapped\nin the tubing and returns to the regenerator in the cold blow. In other\nwords, the single tubing acts as a void volume.\n\n\n\n210 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nIn the preliminary tests, no thermal load is applied (zero load condi-\ntion), so the maximum regenerator temperature span is achieved at\neach particular operating condition. Fig. 6.1 shows a typical tempera-\nture measurement obtained in a preliminary test.\n\ntime [s]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n282\n\n284\n\n286\n\n288\n\n290\n\n292\n\n294\n\n296\n\n298\n\n300\n\n302\nTHE\n\nTCE\n\nTH\n\nFigure 6.1 \u2013 Typical time-dependent temperature evolution during the\nAMR preliminary tests.\n\nThe no-load tests were performed for different temperatures of the hot\nreservoir, between 290 K and 315 K, in steps of 5 K. The results of\nthe preliminary tests are presented in terms of ?TReg as a function of\nTH for two different frequencies: 0.25 and 0.5 Hz, as shown in Fig. 6.2.\nThe experiments were performed at the ambient temperatures, TAmb,\nof 293 and 300 K. In all tests, after setting the temperature of the\nroom, the measurements started only after 24 hours to ensure thermal\nequilibrium between the magnetic circuit and the ambient.\n\nThe results presented in Fig. 6.2 in general agreed with those by other\nauthors (TURA; ROWE, 2011; ARNOLD et al., 2014). Based on the pre-\nliminary no-load tests, the following remarks can be made:\n\n\n\n6.1 Preliminary Tests 211\n\nTH [K]\n\n?\nT\n\nR\ne\n\ng\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n285 290 295 300 305 310 315 320\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nTAmb = 293 K\nTAmb = 300 K\n\n(a)\n\nTH [K]\n\n?\nT\n\nR\ne\n\ng\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n285 290 295 300 305 310 315 320\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nTAmb = 293 K\nTAmb = 300 K\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.2 \u2013 ?TReg as a function of TH: (a) f = 0.25 Hz; (b) f = 1 Hz.\n\n\n\n212 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\n1. In Fig. 6.1, the outlet temperature at the cold end, TC, has a large\namplitude as a result of the single tubing acting as void volume.\nAs discussed in Sections 5.4 and 5.5 the void volumes impose\nvariable temperature boundary conditions at the regenerator ends\nthat, in the case of the zero load AMR tests, are not strictly\nadiabatic due to the thermal interaction of the void volume with\nthe ambient at the cold end;\n\n2. Due to a less effective thermal insulation of the active regenera-\ntors, the ambient and the magnetic circuit temperatures have a\nsignificant influence on ?TReg. This influence can be understood\nas a parasitic heat gain, or a parasitic heat loss, depending on the\ntemperatures of the hot and cold ends of the regenerator;\n\n3. Considering the axial temperature profile in the regenerator, the\nregion along which the temperature inside the regenerator is be-\nlow the magnetic circuit temperature experiences a heat gain.\nConversely, the region along which the temperature is above the\nmagnetic circuit temperature experiences a heat loss. If the heat\ngain surpasses the heat loss, the magnetic circuit acts toward re-\nducing ?TReg. Otherwise, if the heat loss wins, the magnetic\ncircuit helps to cool down the matrix, increasing ?TReg;\n\n4. For the conditions in Fig. 6.2, as TH is increased, ?TReg becomes\nlarger for two different reasons: (i) the decrease with temperature\nof the (negative) adiabatic temperature change for demagnetiza-\ntion (MCE), which reaches a minimum coming from the ferro-\nmagnetic phase at around 295 K, and increases at a slower rate\nfor higher temperatures, in the paramagnetic phase (TREVIZOLI\net al., 2011); (ii) the change from a net heat gain case (considering\nthe whole length of the regenerator), to a net heat loss case, as\nthe length of the heat gain region is reduced and TC approaches\nTAmb.\n\nTherefore, to perform experiments that truly evaluate the AMR per-\nformance, it is important to avoid conditions in which the heat loss to\nmagnetic circuit \u201cimprove\u201d the regenerator performance. Therefore, in\nall experimental tests, the following temperature equilibrium condition\nwill be considered: TH = TAmb = TMag. This condition is one of heat\ngain, which deteriorates the AMR performance, but is more realistic\nfrom the point of view of a real magnetic cooling application. Finally,\nas in the passive regenerator experiments, the temperature equilibrium\n\n\n\n6.2 Time-Dependent Measurements 213\n\ncondition was such that TH = TAmb = 300 K in all experiments pre-\nsented in this thesis.\n\n6.2 Time-Dependent Measurements\n\nThe time-dependent measurements performed by the different trans-\nducers were used in the calculation of the time-average values needed\nto compute the performance metrics. The same instrumentation and\nDAQ used in the passive experiments were used in the AMR tests. Also,\nthe same strategy to evaluate the time-average variables was applied,\nin which 300 experimental points per cycle and a total of five cycles are\nconsidered in the calculations. The time-dependent measurements are\nexplained next.\n\n6.2.1 Temperature Measurements\n\nAn AMR test starts with a zero thermal load applied on the heater.\nThe temperatures of the hot reservoir and of the ambient were kept\nat 300 K (temperature equilibrium condition). As the test progresses,\nthe temperature at the cold end of the regenerator, TCE, decreases and\nthe compensation temperatures, TCH-out and THeater-in, are adjusted\nso as to match the time-average temperature of the fluid that exits\nthe regenerator at the cold end, T CE. When this condition is reached\n(with a safety margin of +0.1 K), the periodically developed regime is\nassumed and the data are saved considering 300 points per cycle. In the\nfollowing test, the heater is turned on and, again, TCH-out and THeater-in\nare adjusted to match the new T CE temperature, and a new periodically\ndeveloped condition is established. This procedure was repeated until\nthe maximum thermal load condition, at which ?THex = TH ? TC ?\n0. Fig. 6.3 shows the five cycles of the time-dependent temperature\nmeasurements during the periodically developed regime for different\nthermal loads, considering the operating condition of f = 0.5 Hz and\n? ? 0.41.\n\nSome remarks are in order regarding the experimental procedure:\n\n? The objective of the temperature compensation is to find the\ncondition at which TCH-out = THeater-in = T CE. During a test,\ntwo different situations can occur while the bath temperature\n\n\n\n214 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nt* = 2?ft [-]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n270\n\n275\n\n280\n\n285\n\n290\n\n295\n\n300\n\n?THex = 28 K\n .\nQc = 3.61 W\n\n?THex = 24.1 K\n .\nQc = 5.70 W\n\n?THex = 19.1 K\n .\nQc = 8.46 W\n\n?THex = 12.4 K\n .\nQc = 10.87 W\n\n?THex = 4.5 K\n .\nQc = 12.85 W\n\n?THex = 0 K\n .\nQc = 13.9 W\n\n Hot Reservoir Temperature  (TH)\n Cold Reservoir Temperature  (TC)\n Cold End Temperature (TCE)\n\nVoid Volume Impact\n\n? 2? 3? 4? 5? 6? 7? 8? 9? 10?\n\nFigure 6.3 \u2013 Time-dependent temperature measurements at the peri-\nodically developed regime for different thermal loads at the operating\ncondition of f = 0.5 Hz and ? ? 0.41 for Spheres#3 geometry (Casing\n#3 and dp = 0.55 mm).\n\nis adjusted: (i) if THeater-in (and TCH-out) is greater than T CE,\nthe temperature of the thermal bath has to be reduced; (ii) if\nTHeater-in (and TCH-out) is lower than T CE, the temperature of\nthe bath has to be raised. To perform a reliable characterization,\nif situation (i) exists, then the thermal bath is adding some heat\nto the regenerator, which can be interpreted as an additional\nthermal load. On the other hand, if situation (ii) is verified,\nthen the thermal bath is artificially increasing the AMR cooling\ncapacity, what is not physically consistent with the actual AMR\nperformance. To avoid the situation (ii) a safety margin of +0.1\nK was included in the temperature compensation. In this case,\nthe safety margin of +0.1 K represents an additional heat input\n\n\n\n6.2 Time-Dependent Measurements 215\n\nthat has to be included in the experimental procedure to calculate\nthe cooling capacity that will be explained in Section 6.3;\n\n? In the tests where the heater is turned off, because of the tem-\nperature safety margin and mainly due to the heat gain from the\nambient through the cold side tubing, the zero thermal load con-\ndition is never truly satisfied. For example, in Fig. 6.3 for the\ntest in which the heater was switched off, ?THex and the cool-\ning capacity were calculated at 28 K and 3.61 W, respectively,\nwhich can be attributed mainly to the heat gain from the ambi-\nent. In this case, the ambient temperature was 300 K and TC was\napproximately 272 K. Clearly, the higher ?THex, the higher the\nheat gain from the ambient;\n\n? In Fig. 6.3, there is an indication of the void volume impact on the\ntime-dependent temperature measurements. In the AMR tests\nthe void volume plays the same role as in the passive regenerators.\nIts impact on the AMR performance will be discussed in Section\n6.5.2.\n\n6.2.2 Torque Measurements\n\nFig. 6.4 shows the last five cycles of the time-dependent total torque\nmeasurements. Fig. 6.4(a) presents the results for different values of\n?THex, considering f = 0.5 Hz and ? ? 0.41, as in Fig. 6.3. Fig. 6.4(b)\npresents the results for different utilizations, considering f = 0.5 Hz\nand ?THex = 0. The results resemble a sinusoidal waveform, with su-\nperposed high frequency oscillations that are related to the magnetic\ncircuit torque contribution. The magnetic circuit torque characteriza-\ntion is discussed in greater detail in Appendix A.\n\nSince the magnetic circuit and the pumping system are driven by a\nsingle motor, the total torque is a combination of four different contri-\nbutions: (i) the torque of the magnetic circuit without the regenerator\n(see Appendix A), (ii) the pumping system torque, (iii) the magnetic\ninteraction torque and (iv) the torque associated with the mechanical\nlosses. The magnetic interaction torque is the reversible part of the\ntorque, which can be positive or negative depending on the magnetic\nattraction. The positive values are related to the torque necessary to\nremove the magnetic field from the regenerator bed, which corresponds\nto the demagnetization process. On the other hand, the negative part\n\n\n\n216 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nt* = 2?ft [-]\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n [\n\nN\nm\n\n]\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n? 9?3? 4? 5? 6? 7? 8?2? 10?\n\n ?THex = 0 K\n\nIncreasing \n?THex\n\n ?THex = 4.5 K\n ?THex = 12.4 K\n\n ?THex = 19.1 K\n ?THex = 24.1 K\n ?THex = 28 K\n\nMagnet Torque \nContribution\n\n(a)\n\nt* = 2?ft [-]\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n [\n\nN\nm\n\n]\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n? 9?3? 4? 5? 6? 7? 8?2? 10?\n\n ? = 0 .38\n\nIncreasing \n?\n\n ? = 0 .58\n ? = 0 .77\n\n ? = 0 .96\n ? = 1.15\n\nf = 0.5 Hz\n?THex = 0 K\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.4 \u2013 Time-dependent total torque measurements: (a) Variable\n?THex for f = 0.5 Hz and ? ? 0.41; (b) Variable utilization for f =\n0.5 Hz and ?THex = 0.\n\n\n\n6.2 Time-Dependent Measurements 217\n\nis related to the application of the magnetic field on the regenerator\nbed during the magnetization process. The pumping torque is an ir-\nreversible contribution, i.e., always positive. As a result, the positive\npeaks and the negative valleys of the total torque are not symmetric.\n\nIn Fig. 6.4(a), since the utilization and frequency are constant, the\nincrease in the total torque is just related to the increasing ?THex.\nAs ?THex becomes higher, the temperature of the cold reservoir is\nreduced. For a fixed hot reservoir temperature, the fraction of the\nregenerator that is in the ferromagnetic phase increases. This increases\nthe magnetic attraction and the torque necessary to rotate the magnet\nbecomes higher. Also, but to a lower extent, the pumping system\ntorque also increases as the working fluid becomes more viscous due\nto the temperature reduction. Fig. 6.4(b) shows the influence of the\npumping system torque, considering ?THex = 0. In this case, the\nmagnetic interaction torque is the same for all utilizations. As the\nutilization is increased, the total torque becomes higher because of the\nviscous losses.\n\n6.2.3 Influence of the Oscillating Torque on the\nPressure Drop and Mass Flow Rate\n\nThe drivers for the pumping system and magnetic circuit are linked\nby the bevel gear boxes and are driven by the same stepper motor.\nAs a result, the oscillating torque from the magnetic circuit interferes\nwith the flow velocity. Fig. 6.5 shows the influence of the oscillating\ntorque on the instantaneous mass flow rate (for PP#122.5 and sk =\n10 mm), and on the instantaneous total pressure drop (for PP#122.5\nand sk = 10 and 20 mm), respectively. The measurements performed\nin AMRs are compared with those carried out in passive regenerators.\nThe differences in mass flow rate and pressure drop can be attributed\nto the oscillating torque and to the fluid properties, since the water-\nglycol mixture is more dense and more viscous than pure water and,\nhence, the peak of the mass flow rate and pressure drop are higher for\nthe AMRs.\n\nThe instantaneous mass flow rate, Fig. 6.5(a), is less sensitive to the\ntorque oscillations due to the second-order measurement effects (time\nconstant) of the Coriolis mass flow meters, but some influences are\nvisible and indicated by the arrows. The impact on the instantaneous\npressure drop is more visible, indicating some significant variations of\n\n\n\n218 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nt* = 2?ft\n\nM\na\n\ns\ns\n\n F\nlo\n\nw\n R\n\na\nte\n\n [\nk\n\ng\n/h\n\n]\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25 Cold Blow\n\nHot Blow\n\n? 2?\n\n Experimental from passive tests\n Experimental from AMR tests\n\n- - Momentum Equation\n\n(a)\n\nt* = 2?ft\n\nT\no\n\nta\nl \nP\n\nre\ns\n\ns\nu\n\nre\n D\n\nro\np\n\n [\nk\n\nP\na\n\n]\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40 Cold Blow\n\nHot Blow\n\n? 2? 3? 4?\n\n sk = 10 mm - AMR\n--- sk = 10 mm - Passive\n\n sk = 20 mm - AMR\n--- sk = 20 mm - Passive\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.5 \u2013 Oscillating torque influences on the: (a) Instantaneous\nmass flow rate for PP#122.5 and sk = 10 mm; (b) Instantaneous total\npressure drop for PP#122.5 and sk = 10 and 20 mm.\n\n\n\n6.3 Performance Metrics and Data Regression 219\n\nthe instantaneous flow velocity. Also, the variations in flow velocity are\nnot perfectly symmetric.\n\nIt is important to mention that, although the instantaneous velocities in\nthe hot and cold blows are not symmetric, in terms of the cycle-average\nvalues, the AMR still operates under balanced flow conditions, as the\namount of pumped fluid (and the utilization factor) is fixed for both\nblows. The blow period did not present significant variations either\n(lower than 5%). Despite the variation in the instantaneous value, the\ntime-average mass flow rate is still in good agreement with the reference\nvalue, as explained in Section 5.1.2. Thus, the time-average value will\nbe used in the performance metrics analysis explained next.\n\n6.3 Performance Metrics and Data Regres-\nsion\n\nThe AMR performance metrics are related to the cycle-average cooling\ncapacity and the total cycle-average power input to drive the magnetic\ncircuit and pumping system. Fig. 6.6 shows a schematic representation\nof the main variables of a generic magnetic refrigerator.\n\nBased on the schematic diagram in Fig. 6.6 there are finite temperature\ndifferences associated with the hot, ?TH, and cold, ?TC, reservoirs.\nThese temperature differences are necessary due to finite heat transfer\nareas in each heat exchanger, which make their thermal effectiveness\nlower than unity. The temperature differences in the figure are defined\nas follows:\n\n?TC = TC ?T CE (6.1)\n\n?TH = TH ?T HE (6.2)\n\n?THex = TH ?TC (6.3)\n\n?TReg = T HE ?T CE (6.4)\n\n\n\n220 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\n Cold Blow\n\nHot Blow\n\nHot Blow\n\nCold Blow\n\nWork\n\nH\ne\na\nt \n\nO\nu\n\nt\nH\n\ne\na\nt \n\nIn\n\nHot reservoir at TH\n\nCold reservoir at TC\n\n?TH\n\n ?THex\n\n?TC\n\n?TReg\n\nFigure 6.6 \u2013 Schematic representation of the main variables of a generic\nmagnetic refrigerator.\n\nwhere ?TReg is the regenerator temperature span, which is always\ngreater than the thermal reservoir temperature span, ?THex.

The inte-\ngrations were performed numerically using the extended Simpson rule\n(Eq. (5.10)). Fig. 6.7 shows the time-dependent temperature measure-\nments of TH, TC, THE and TCE for two different situations: (i) an in-\ntermediate thermal load test, Fig. 6.7(a), and (ii) a maximum thermal\nload test, Fig. 6.7(b).\n\nThe intermediate thermal load test situation is associated with a spe-\ncific operating condition characterized by positive (non-zero) values of\ncooling capacity and ?THex. The maximum load test, on the other\nhand, is defined by ?THex = 0 and ?TReg > 0. In this case, if\n?TReg = 0 is considered for the condition of maximum cooling capacity,\nthere will be a thermodynamic inconsistency regarding the operation of\nthe refrigeration system, as the temperatures of the thermal reservoirs\nwill be inverted, i.e., TH &lt;TC.\n\nThe instantaneous cooling capacity, Q?C, is calculated by:\n\nQ?C = m?(t)cp,f(TC ?TCE(t)) (6.9)\n\nand the cycle-average cooling capacity, Q?C, is determined by:\n\nQ?C =\n1\n\n?\n\n? ?/2\n0\n\nm?(t)cp,f(TC ?TCE(t))dt (6.10)\n\nEqs.

How-\never, due to the existence of oscillating torque and second-order effects\nin the Coriolis mass flow meter, the experimental determination of m?(t)\nmay be subjected to a few inconsistencies at some conditions. To elimi-\nnate this problem, the experimental cycle-average cooling capacity was\ncalculated by:\n\nQ?C =\n1\n\n2\nm?cp,f(TC ?T CE) (6.11)\n\nwhere m? is the reference mass flow rate, TC is given by Eq. (6.8) and\nT CE by Eq. (6.6). The factor (1/2) accounts for the discontinuity of\nthe cycle, i.e., the hot blow period is half the total period.\n\nThe experimental evaluation of Q?C proposed in this thesis is differ-\nent from those usually encountered in the literature (KITANOVSKI et\nal., 2015). Generally, the electrical heater power is used to emulate a\nthermal load. However, since one of the main objectives of the exper-\nimental analysis is to compare and validate the numerical model, the\nuse of Eq. (6.11) is more appropriate, since the calculation is based on\nthe same parameters (m? and TCE) derived from the numerical results\n(Eq. (6.10)). The main advantage of this procedure is that Eq. (6.11)\nreturns the \u2018actual cooling potential\u2019 of the AMR, which takes into ac-\ncount all the thermal loads imposed on the regenerator, including the\nelectrical heater power input and the heat gain from external sources,\nsuch as the ambient and the safety margin used in the cold heat ex-\nchanger temperature compensation explained previously.\n\nOn the other hand, this kind of experimental evaluation is more suscep-\ntible to experimental uncertainties, as will be explained in more details\nand quantified in the next section. Because of this, an additional eval-\n\nuation of Q?C was performed and used to verify the consistency of the\ncalculation. Thus:\n\nQ?C,ver = m?cp,f(THeater-out ?T Heater-in) (6.12)\n\nwhere Q?C,ver is the heat load applied by the heater, which includes\nthe Joule heating by the electrical heater and the heat gain from the\nambient through the heater control volume.\n\n\n\n224 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nThe cycle-average total power, W? , needed to perform the magnetic flux\ndensity variation and the oscillating fluid flow is calculated by:\n\nW? = 2?fM? (6.13)\n\nwhere ? is the cycle-average total torque and fM is the stepper mo-\ntor frequency, which is half the AMR operating frequency. As ex-\nplained previously, the instantaneous torque measurement, ?(t), al-\nready accounts for four torque contributions, namely the magnetic cir-\ncuit torque, the pumping torque, magnetic interaction torque and me-\nchanical losses. ? is calculated by:\n\n? =\n1\n\n?\n\n??\ni=1\n\n(\n1\n\n?\n\n? ?\n0\n\n?(t)dt\n\n)\n(6.14)\n\nThe coefficient of performance, COP , is defined as:\n\nCOP =\nQ?C\n\nW?\n(6.15)\n\nand the second-law efficiency, ?2nd, as:\n\n?2nd =\nCOP\n\nCOPid\n(6.16)\n\nwhere the ideal, or Carnot, coefficient of performance, COPid, is given\nby:\n\nCOPid =\nTC\n\nTH ?TC\n(6.17)\n\n6.3.1 Uncertainty Analysis\n\nThe experimental uncertainties related to the AMR performance met-\nrics were evaluated according to the methodology presented in Section\n\n\n\n6.3 Performance Metrics and Data Regression 225\n\n5.2.1. Eqs. (5.11), (5.14) and (5.16) were used to compute the combined\nand the expanded uncertainties. The values of the calculated expanded\nuncertainties are described together with the results.\n\nRegarding the uncertainties of the cycle-average cooling capacity and,\n\nconsequently, the COP and the second-law efficiency, Q?C is calculated\nbased on the temperature difference between the time-average temper-\n\natures TC and T CE (?TC = TC ?T CE). Depending on the value of Q?C\nand m?, the absolute value of the temperature difference ?TC can be of\nthe order of the experimental uncertainty of ?TC. The uncertainty as-\nsociated with ?TC is approximately 0.3 K. As a result, the uncertainty\n\nevaluated for Q?C is on same order of the absolute value of Q?C.\n\nHowever, the points mentioned below ensure that the proposed exper-\n\nimental evaluation of Q?C is robust and reliable:\n\n1. All experimental tests were performed using the same calibrated\ntemperature probes. The calibration procedure, described in\nChapter 3, was carefully performed and utilized a recently cal-\nibrated standard thermometer;\n\n2. The assembly and measurements with the temperature probes\nwere performed following the procedure developed for the passive\nregenerators, which was demonstrated to be physically consistent\nthrough comparisons with the numerical model. Based on this\nprevious experience, one can ensure that the temperature mea-\nsurements in the AMR were successfully performed;\n\n3. Although the absolute value of ?TC is of the order of 0.3 K, the\ntime-dependent measurement of TCE presented a continuous be-\nhavior with an amplitude always larger than 0.5 K. In addition, a\nvery good reproducibility was observed considering the five cycles\nused in the calculation of the average temperature values. This\nmeans a small standard deviation for the five cycles;\n\n4. In all experimental results presented in this thesis, the differences\n\nbetween Q?C and Q?C,ver were smaller than the related uncertain-\n\nties, with Q?C always slightly larger than Q?C,ver. This is justified\nby the temperature safety margin used in the cold heat exchanger\ntemperature compensation.\n\n\n\n226 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\n6.4 Reproducibility of the Experimental\nResults\n\nAs in the passive regenerator experimental characterization, the first\nevaluation of the AMR performance focuses on the experimental repro-\nducibility of the results. These experimental tests were repeated three\ntimes by three different operators (PVT, ATN and GFP). The Spheres\n#3 geometry (see Table 3.9) were used as the regenerative matrix. As-\nsembly #1 was evaluated first by operator PVT. Later, Assemblies #2\nand #3 were tested by operators ATN and GFP, respectively, following\nthe same procedure used by PVT.\n\nFig. 6.8 shows the reproducibility of the results for Q?C as a function\nof ?THex considering three different operating conditions: (i) ? ? 0.41\nand f = 0.25 Hz, (ii) ? ? 0.41 and f = 0.5 Hz, (iii) ? ? 1.23 and f =\n0.25 Hz. The results showed a very good reproducibility, with the same\ntrend being observed for all assemblies. The experimental uncertainty\n\nfor ?THex was evaluated at 0.3 K. Regarding the uncertainty of Q?C,\nthe following comments can be made:\n\n? For ? ? 0.41 and f = 0.25 Hz, the uncertainty was estimated at\n1.5 W, with the lowest Q?C being around 2.6 W and the maximum\n\nQ?C being close to 7.5 W;\n\n? For ? ? 0.41 and f = 0.5 Hz, the uncertainty was estimated at\n3.0 W, with the lowest Q?C being around 3.6 W and the maximum\n\nQ?C being close to 14.0 W;\n\n? For ? ? 1.23 and f = 0.25 Hz, the uncertainty was estimated at\n4.5 W, with the lowest Q?C being around 5.3 W and the maximum\n\nQ?C being 20.1 W.\n\nConsidering the three cases above, the uncertainty related to the max-\n\nimum Q?C is around 20%. As Q?C decreases, ?TC also decreases since\nthe mass flow rate is fixed. As a result, the uncertainty related to\n\nQ?C approaches 90% of the calculated Q?C. In both situations, the cal-\nculated uncertainties are considerably large.

In the\npresent analysis, this will be considered the reference AMR geometry.\n\n6.5.1 Experimental Results\n\n6.5.1.1 Characteristic Curves\n\nThe cooling capacity, Q?C, as a function of the temperature span, ?THex,\nis known as the cooling system characteristic (or performance) curve.\nFig. 6.9 shows the characteristic curves for Spheres #3 as a function\nof utilization for frequencies of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz. TH was kept at 300\nK. The curves were generated increasing the thermal load from a mini-\nmum value up to the maximum value, for which ?THex ? 0. As already\ndiscussed, the true zero-load condition cannot be evaluated because of\nthe external heat gain. However, it can be inferred from extrapolations\nof the performance curves.\n\nThe results in Fig. 6.9 show that Q?C varies approximately linearly with\n\n?THex. However, for some utilizations, as ?THex increases (and Q?C\ndecreases), some deviations in the linear trend are seen. This change in\nbehavior of the system curve can be attributed to: (i) the temperature\nand magnetic flux density dependence on the specific heat and MCE;\n(ii) the reversibility of the MCE; (iii) the void volume influence on the\nAMR performance, as will be explained in Section 6.5.2.\n\nRegarding the differences between ?THex and ?TReg, Fig. 6.10 shows\n\nQ?C as a function of the two temperature spans, ?THex and ?TReg, for\n? ? 0.38 and different frequencies. From these results, it is possible\nto verify that the differences between ?THex and ?TReg go from ap-\n\nproximately 1 K, for the smallest values of Q?C, to around 2 K for the\n\nmaximum values of Q?C. This result strengthens the justification for\nchoosing ?THex ? 0 for the experimental definition of the maximum\nQ?C; alternatively if ?TReg ? 0 was set as the maximum cooling ca-\npacity condition, then ?THex would be negative, which is against the\npurpose of a refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 229\n\n?THex [K]\n\nC\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n A\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\no\n\no\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n? ~ 0.14\n? ~ 0.21\n? ~ 0.28\n? ~ 0.38\n? ~ 0.58\n? ~ 0.77\n? ~ 0.96\n? ~ 1.15\n\n(a)\n\n?THex [K]\n\nC\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n A\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\no\n\no\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n? ~ 0.14\n? ~ 0.21\n? ~ 0.28\n? ~ 0.38\n? ~ 0.58\n? ~ 0.77\n? ~ 0.96\n? ~ 1.15\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n230 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\n?THex [K]\n\nC\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n A\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\no\n\no\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n? ~ 0.14\n? ~ 0.21\n? ~ 0.28\n? ~ 0.38\n? ~ 0.58\n? ~ 0.77\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6.9 \u2013 Q?C as a function of ?THex for TH = 300 K and a range of\nutilization factors: (a) f = 0.25 Hz; (b) f = 0.5 Hz; (c) f = 1 Hz.\n\n6.5.1.2 Total Power (Work) Analysis\n\nLike the torque, the total power consumed by the system is composed\nby four contributions: (i) the power to drive the magnetic circuit with-\nout the regenerator; (ii) the pumping power; (iii) the power to overcome\nthe magnetic interaction with the regenerator; (iv) the power to over-\ncome the mechanical losses. Since there is no relationship between the\nmagnetic circuit and mechanical loss contributions and the variable re-\ngenerator temperature span or the utilization factor1, to simplify the\nanalysis, the total power will be divided in only two contributions:\n\nW? = W? Mag + W? pump (6.18)\n\nwhere W?

The thermodynamic magnetic power is comparatively small\n\nand it is already accounted for in W? Mag.\n\nFig. 6.11 shows in detail the magnetic and pumping contributions to\nthe total power as a function of the cold reservoir temperature, TC, for\nthree different utilization factors (0.28, 0.38 and 0.58) and two operat-\ning frequencies (0.5 and 1 Hz).

As TC is reduced with the increasing temperature span for TH =\n300 K, the cycle average total power increases mainly due to the\nincrease of the magnetic interaction, as the magnetic material be-\ncomes more ferromagnetic. Also, a small increase in the pumping\ncontribution is verified, given the increase in fluid viscosity as the\nfluid becomes colder;\n\n2. By increasing the utilization for a fixed frequency, W? pump be-\ncomes higher. For example, for ? ? 0.28, f = 0.5 Hz and TC =\n280 K, the contributions of W? Mag and W? pump are 80.2% and\n19.8%, respectively. On the other hand, for ? ? 0.58, f = 0.5\nHz and TC = 280 K, the contribution of W? pump is increased to\n\n32.9% and that of W? Mag is reduced to 67.1%. Since TC and TH\n\nare fixed and the absolute value of W? Mag is about the same, the\n\nincrease in the total power is due to an increase in W? pump result-\ning from a larger pressure drop and higher mass flow rate. The\nsame conclusions can be extended to all values of TC and to the\nfrequency of 1 Hz;\n\n3. By increasing the frequency, the contribution of W? pump is also\nincreased due to the larger pressure drop and higher mass flow\nrate. For example, for ? ? 0.58, f = 0.5 Hz and TC = 280\nK, the contributions of W? Mag and W? pump are 67.1% and 32.9%.\nHowever, for ? ? 0.58, f = 1 Hz and TC = 280 K, the contribution\nof W? pump is increased to 51.4% and that of W? Mag is reduced to\n48.6%, taking into account the additional increase in the magnetic\ncircuit torque. Thus, the increase in the total power, when the\nfrequencies of 0.5 Hz and 1 Hz are compared, is mainly due to\n\nthe increase in W? pump. The same conclusions can be extended to\nall values of TC and to the other utilizations.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnetic interaction contribution is more significant\nfor the smaller values of TC and ?. On the other hand, as the mass flow\nrate is increased, by changing the utilization or the operating frequency,\nthe pumping power becomes more important and, in some cases, is the\nmain component of the total power.\n\n\n\n234 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\n6.5.1.3 AMR Performance Analysis\n\nThe AMR performance analysis is based on the behavior of Q?C, COP\nand ?2nd as a function of ? for different lines of constant ?THex, as\nshown in Figs. 6.12 to 6.14. Separate figures are used for different\nfrequencies, namely 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz. For the Spheres #3 bed, ?THex\nranges from 5 to 25 K. The main advantage of having ?THex as a\nparameter in the plots is the existence of a single ideal coefficient of\nperformance, COPid, for each line. This facilitates the interpretation\nof the results from a thermodynamic efficiency point of view.\n\nIt is important to mention that the values of Q?C that correspond to\na given target value of ?THex were evaluated using interpolating func-\ntions (R2 > 0.99) of the experimental data shown in the system char-\nacteristic curves of Fig. 6.9. The use of the interpolating functions\nhas a negligible influence on the experimental uncertainty discussed in\nSections 6.3.1 and 6.4.\n\nIn the cooling capacity curves, Fig. 6.12, as the value of ?THex in-\n\ncreases, Q?C decreases and, depending on the target ?THex, it is possi-\n\nble to observe a peak of Q?C for a given utilization. For ?THex = 0 and\n\n5 K, the peak of Q?C is outside the experimental utilization range. For\nsafety reasons, at f = 1 Hz, it was not possible to perform measure-\nments at the highest utilizations due to the high pressure drop in the\nregenerator.\n\nTaking the curve for ?THex = 10 K as an example, the following re-\nmarks can be made:\n\n? For 0.25 Hz, a peak Q?C of approximately 9.5 W (48.6 W/kg) is\nobserved in the range 0.8 &lt;? &lt;1;\n\n? For 0.5 Hz, a peak Q?C of approximately 16.5 W (84.5 W/kg) is\nfound at ? ? 0.77;\n\n? For 1 Hz the highest value of Q?C for ?THex = 10 K is around 29.2\nW (149.5 W/kg), and the peak is outside the utilization range.\n\nIn terms of the specific cooling capacity (in W/kg) for ?THex = 10\nK, the results are on the same order of magnitude as those from other\npublished works, as presented in Table 2.2.\n\n\n\n6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 235\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nC\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n A\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\no\n\no\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n?THex = 0 K\n?THex = 5 K\n?THex = 10 K\n?THex = 15 K\n?THex = 20 K\n\n(a)\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nC\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n A\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\no\n\no\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n?THex = 0 K\n?THex = 5 K\n?THex = 10 K\n?THex = 15 K\n?THex = 20 K\n?THex = 25 K\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n236 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nC\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n A\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\no\n\no\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n?THex = 0 K\n?THex = 5 K\n?THex = 10 K\n?THex = 15 K\n?THex = 20 K\n?THex = 25 K\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6.12 \u2013 Q?C as a function of ? for TH = 300 K and different ?THex:\n(a) f = 0.25 Hz; (b) f = 0.5 Hz; (c) f = 1 Hz.\n\nIn the COP curves, Fig. 6.13, COP increases as the THex decreases,\n\nowing to the reduction of Q?C (Fig. 6.12) and the increase in W?

Moreover, as the frequency in-\n\ncreases, both Q?C and W? increase, since the penalties associated with\nthe viscous losses become more significant as the superficial flow veloc-\nity is raised, requiring a larger total power to drive the AMR. In terms\n\nof the utilization factor, the peaks of the COP and Q?C do not neces-\n\nsarily coincide, as a result of the steeper increase in W? as ? increases.\nIn summary, as ? or f increase, the COP becomes more sensitive to\nthe viscous losses.\n\nThe behavior of the second-law efficiency with respect to utilization and\n?THex is presented in Fig. 6.14. The lines of constant ?THex correspond\nto fixed values of COPid, which decrease as ?THex increases. From a\nthermodynamic efficiency standpoint, the best operating conditions for\neach ?THex are clearly identified for each frequency in Fig. 6.14.

For 0.25 Hz, a peak ?2nd of approximately 13% is observed at ? ?\n0.58 for ?THex = 15 and 20 K. For ?THex = 15 K, Q?C ? 7 W\n(35.8 W/kg) and COP ? 2.5;\n\n?

For ?THex = 15 K, Q?C ? 19 W\n(97.3 W/kg) and COP ? 1.5;\n\nAlthough peaks in second-law efficiency can be identified for each ope-\nrating condition, direct comparisons between curves for the same ?THex\nat different frequencies must be made cautiously, as the cooling capacity\nis not the same. However, it is clear that the tests with the Spheres\n\n\n\n6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 241\n\n#3 AMR assembled in Casing #3 with 0.55-mm spheres resulted in\nmore thermodynamically efficient conditions for ?THex around 15 and\n20 K. For temperature spans smaller than these, although the COP\nis the highest (see Fig. 6.13), COPid is much higher. For the largest\n?THex of 25 K, COPid is lower, but the system COP is already too\nlow due to a combination of a low cooling capacity and a high total\npower, which increases mainly due to a higher magnetic attraction of\nthe ferromagnetic phase, as seen in Fig. 6.11. At intermediate values of\n?THex, the effects are counterbalanced. It should be mentioned that,\nfor a given ?THex, the value of utilization that gives the maximum ?2nd\nalso gives the maximum COP . This is because COPid is constant for\na given ?THex.\n\nThe occurrence of maximum second-law efficiencies for ?THex between\n15 and 20 K reflects one of the main limitations of current AMR sys-\ntems, for which the best performance in terms of ?2nd is not compatible\nwith the high cooling capacity/large temperature span operation typ-\nical of commercially available cooling systems. On the contrary, (i)\nfor the highest attainable cooling capacities, the temperature span was\nsmall and the lowest values of ?2nd were found; (ii) for the highest tem-\nperature span, both the cooling capacity and the COP were low, which\nreduced ?2nd.\n\nAlthough they are out of the scope of this thesis, some reflections and\nguidelines to improve the performance of AMR systems equipped with\nstandard magnetocaloric materials are in order, given the experience\naccumulated in this study:\n\n1. The use of higher operating frequencies increases the cooling ca-\npacity, but does not necessarily increase the temperature span.\nMoreover, it increases the viscous losses. Also, as shown in the\nresults, increasing the motor frequency reduces the system COP .\nA more appropriate approach would be to increase the AMR fre-\nquency keeping a lower motor operating frequency, for example,\nusing a magnetic circuit with 2 or more magnetic poles;\n\n2. The arrangement of regenerators in parallel increases the cooling\ncapacity due to the larger mass of magnetocaloric material and\nguarantees a continuous cycle. However, this configuration does\nnot increase the temperature span and adds to the complexity of\nthe combined design of the AMR and flow distribution system.\nTherefore, if this design is not performed carefully, the cooling\n\n\n\n242 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nsystem may not perform adequately in terms of COP and ?THex;\n\n3. The arrangement of regenerators in series (e.g., cascade) can im-\nprove the system temperature span, but does not increase the\ncooling capacity. In addition, this arrangement usually requires\na larger total power to overcome the viscous losses.\n\nFigs. 6.15 and 6.16 present the maximum values of ?THex and Q?C,\nrespectively, as a function of frequency and utilization. The maximum\n\nQ?C was obtained directly for the condition ?THex = 0. However, the\nmaximum ?THex could not be characterized experimentally because,\neven when the electrical heater was not in operation, the zero thermal\nload condition cannot be truly obtained because of the heat gain from\nthe ambient. This way, the maximum ?THex was determined from\nan extrapolation/interpolation of the system curves (Fig. 6.9). The\nuncertainty of this extrapolation was estimated at 2 K.\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \n\n?\nT\n\nH\ne\n\nx\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\nf = 1 Hz\n\nf = 0.5 Hz\n\nf = 0.25 Hz\n\nFigure 6.15 \u2013 Maximum ?THex as a function of ? for TH = 300 K and\ndifferent operating frequencies.\n\nThe results for the maximum ?THex share some of the characteristic\n\n\n\n6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 243\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \nC\n\ny\nc\n\nle\n A\n\nv\ne\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n C\n\no\no\n\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\nf = 1 Hz\n\nf = 0.5 Hz\n\nf = 0.25 Hz\n\nFigure 6.16 \u2013 Maximum Q?C as a function of ? for TH = 300 K and\ndifferent operating frequencies.\n\ntrends reported by other authors in the literature (NIELSEN et al., 2009;\nTUSEK et al., 2011) where, depending on the frequency, a peak can be\nidentified. The following quantitative features can be obtained from\nFig. 6.15 as follows:\n\n? For 0.25 Hz, a peak close to 30 K was found at ? ? 0.38;\n\n? For 0.5 Hz, a peak close to 35 K seems is likely in the range\n0.21 &lt;? &lt;0.38;\n\n? For 1 Hz, no peak was observed and a maximum ?THex of 37.5\nK was found at ? ? 0.14;\n\nTaking the f = 0.25 Hz curve as an example, for ? > 0.38, the re-\ngenerator effectiveness decreases with the reduction of the NTU due\nto the increasing mass flow rate, and, as a result, ?THex decreases.\nOn the other hand, for ? &lt;0.38, the tendency is for the regenerator\neffectiveness to increase due to the increase in NTU, however, due to\n\n\n\n244 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nthermal losses, ?THex decreases. In this situation, two types of losses\nare the most important: (i) the axial heat conduction that reduces the\nregenerator effectiveness at small values of utilizations, as discussed\nin Chapter 5; (ii) the casing heat gain. As will be shown in Section\n6.5.2, the casing heat gain is the most significant thermal loss at low\nfrequencies, because the AMR cooling capacity is usually small. As the\nfrequency increases, the peak of ?THex is shifted to small values of ?\nbecause, the magnitude of the axial heat conduction is reduced and,\nas the AMR cooling capacity increases, the relative importance of the\ncasing heat gain decreases.\n\nRegarding the behavior of the maximum Q?C, it increases with the uti-\nlization for all frequencies and the peaks, if any, are out of the utilization\nrange. In this case, the axial heat conduction is negligible and the cas-\ning heat gain is very small. However, as will be explained in detail in\nSection 6.5.2, the void volume has an important influence on the max-\nimum cooling load. The maximum cooling capacities were obtained at\nthe highest utilizations tested. For each frequency, namely, 0.25, 0.5\nand 1 Hz, these were equal to 20.1, 38.8 and 53.7 W, respectively. The\ncorresponding specific cooling capacities were equal to 103, 198.7 and\n275 W/kg, respectively.\n\n6.5.2 Numerical Results and Losses Analyses\n\nThis section will present and discuss the numerical results for the\nSpheres #3 AMR. Simulations were performed with and without the\nterms responsible for the different types of losses in the numerical\nmodel, for the same ranges of frequency, utilization and ?THex ex-\nplored in the experiments. It is worth mentioning that the simulations\nlabeled as without losses already take into account the axial heat con-\nduction, viscous dissipation and the demagnetization losses, as these\nare intrinsic to AMR regenerators. To be consistent with the experi-\nments, in the simulations including losses, TAmb = TMag = TH = 300\nK. More specifically, the following loss terms are considered:\n\n1. Casing heat gain (CHG): this loss corresponds to the heat transfer\nfrom the external environment (i.e., the magnetic circuit) to the\nregenerative matrix;\n\n2. Non-uniformity of the magnetic field (MF): this loss corresponds\nto non-uniformities (i.e., density reductions) of the axial profile\n\n\n\n6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 245\n\nof the magnetic flux density due to edge effects in the magnetic\ncircuit. The axial profile of the magnetic flux density was exper-\nimentally characterized and was presented in Fig. 3.12(b);\n\n3. Void volume (VV): these are leakage losses, already discussed in\ndetail in Chapter 5, in the context of passive regenerators. Similar\neffects are expected here.\n\nFig. 6.17 shows a comparison between the numerical results and exper-\n\nimental data for Q?C as a function of ?THex for different values of uti-\nlization (0.38, 0.58 and 0.77) and frequency (0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz). The\nnumerical simulations were performed considering: (i) no losses; (ii)\nwith CHG loss; (iii) with CHG+MF losses; (iv) with CHG+MF+VV\nlosses. This enables the evaluation of the impact of each loss on the\nAMR performance and, clearly, as the losses are included in the simula-\ntion, the numerical results get closer to the experimental data, showing\na very good agreement for all the operating conditions.\n\nThe model without losses over-predict the data for virtually all condi-\ntions, with the deviations increasing with the increase of ?THex, as the\nzero thermal load conditions are approached. These deviations can be\njustified based on the thermal losses in the AMR, especially the casing\nheat gain. A first remark in support of the casing heat gain as the\nmain thermal loss in an AMR system is the behavior near the point of\nmaximum cooling capacity, at which the no-loss model results and the\nexperimental data are very close. At this condition, ?THex ? 0 K (i.e.,\nTAmb ? TH ? TC ), thus, the casing heat gain is small and its influence\non the Q?C is negligible.\n\nWhen the casing heat gain is included in the simulations, the numerical\nresults in Fig. 6.17 show an impressive reduction of the AMR perfor-\nmance curve, especially near the maximum temperature span. For\nexample, for ? ? 0.38 and f = 0.25 Hz, a reduction of approximately\n13 K is observed for ?THex at zero load. In addition, the following ob-\nservations can be made regarding the simulations including the CHG\nthermal loss:\n\n? For a fixed frequency, as the utilization factor is increased, the\n\nimpact of the CHG on the Q?C vs. ?THex curves is reduced. For\nexample, for ? ? 0.77 and f = 0.25 Hz, the no-loss maximum\n?THex is 37 K and, considering the CHG loss, the maximum\n?THex is close to 30 K, i.e., a reduction of 7 K;\n\n\n\n246 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nCycle Avg.

For a fixed utilization (e.g., ? ? 0.38), increasing the frequency\nalso reduces the impact of the CHG on the Q?C vs. ?THex curves.\nFor example, for ? ? 0.38 and f = 1 Hz, the no loss maximum\n?THex is 42 K and, considering the CHG loss, the maximum\n?THex is close to 38 K, representing a reduction of 4 K.\n\nTo substantiate this analysis, Fig. 6.18 shows the cycle average casing\nheat gain for the discrete finite volumes, i.e., volume 1 to volume 200,\nalong the axial direction. Fig. 6.18(a) shows the results for different\nvalues of ?THex for ? ? 0.38 and f = 0.25 Hz. Fig. 6.18(b) shows\nthe effect of the operating frequency for ? ? 0.38 and ?THex = 25 K.\nAt last, Fig. 6.18(c) shows the influence of the utilization factor for\n?THex = 25 K and f = 0.25 Hz.\n\nIn Fig. 6.18, volume 1 is close to the regenerator hot end and volume\n200 is next to the cold end. In the simulations, the magnetic circuit\nwas assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the ambient at 300 K,\nwhich is the temperature of the hot reservoir. As a result, the volumes\ncloser to the hot end present a negative heat gain. In other words, this\nportion of the regenerator is at a higher temperature than the magnetic\ncircuit (remember that THE > TH), and the AMR transfers heat to the\nHalbach magnets. As the regenerator becomes colder, the heat gain\nincreases up to a maximum at the cold end. These results show how\nimportant it was to be strict about the thermal equilibrium condition\nof TAmb = TMag = TH discussed in Section 6.1, so that the CHG always\nreduces the AMR performance, which is a more realistic condition in\nterms of applications of cooling systems.\n\nConsidering a single finite volume, at a given time-step, the CHG is re-\nsponsible for a small amount of heat being added to the energy balance,\nwhose main effects can be summarized as follows:\n\n? During the hot period of the cycle (i.e., magnetization and cold\nblow) the amount of heat entering the colder part of the regener-\nator is combined with the positive MCE and the enthalpy fluxes\n(in and out), resulting in a new thermal condition. Part of the\nCHG modifies the temperature profiles at the end of the hot pe-\nriod, and the remainder is released at the hot reservoir and in the\nhotter part of the regenerator;\n\n? During the cold period of the cycle (i.e., demagnetization and\nhot blow) the MCE is negative. Thus, a fraction of the MCE is\n\n\n\n248 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nconsumed by the CHG. This, together with the enthalpy fluxes,\nyields a new thermal condition in the volume. As a result, the\ncooling capacity decreases, as part of the refrigerating effect is\ncounterbalanced by the heat gained from the external environ-\nment.\n\nIn Fig. 6.18(a), for fixed values of utilization and frequency, by increas-\ning ?THex, the casing heat gain in a given volume increased. In terms\nof the cycle-average cooling capacity, Table 6.1 shows the reduction of\n\nQ?C as ?THex increases. For ?THex = 25 K, the reduction in Q?C was\n1.49 W, which represented 37% of the AMR potential (no loss) cooling\ncapacity.\n\nTable 6.1 \u2013 Impact of the casing heat gain on the cycle average cooling\ncapacity for different values of ?THex, for ? ? 0.38 and f = 0.25 Hz.\n\n?THex [K] No losses [W] CHG [W] Variation [W]\n\n5 7.31 6.93 0.37 (5.1%)\n15 6.41 5.32 1.09 (17.0%)\n25 4.03 2.54 1.49 (37.0%)\n\nIn Fig. 6.18(b), by increasing the operating frequency, for fixed values of\nutilization and ?THex, the casing heat gain in a given volume increases.\nAs discussed in Chapter 5, since the regenerator temperature profiles\ndid not have substantial variations with frequency, in this case, the\nchange in the total casing heat gain is quite small, which is related to\nthe increasing wall heat transfer coefficient with frequency (see Section\n4.3.6). In terms of the cycle average cooling capacity, presented in\nTable 6.2, increasing the frequency causes a reduction of the percentage\n\ndecrease in Q?C compared with the no-loss cooling capacity.\n\nTable 6.2 \u2013 Impact of the casing heat gain on the cycle average cooling\ncapacity for different values of f, for ? ? 0.38 and ?THex of 25 K.\n\nf [Hz] No losses [W] CHG [W] Variation [W]\n\n0.25 4.03 2.54 1.49 (37.0%)\n0.5 7.76 6.02 1.74 (22.4%)\n1 14.02 11.92 2.09 (14.9%)\n\n\n\n6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 249\n\nDimensionless Length [-]\n\nC\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n A\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\na\n\ns\nin\n\ng\n H\n\ne\na\n\nt \nG\n\na\nin\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n?THex = 5 K\n\n?THex = 15 K\n\n?THex = 25 K\n\n(a)\n\nDimensionless Length [-]\n\nC\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n A\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\na\n\ns\nin\n\ng\n H\n\ne\na\n\nt \nG\n\na\nin\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nf = 0.25 Hz \n\nf = 0.5 Hz \n\nf = 1 Hz \n\n(b)\n\n\n\n250 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nDimensionless Length [-]\n\nC\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n A\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\na\n\ns\nin\n\ng\n H\n\ne\na\n\nt \nG\n\na\nin\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n? = 0.38 \n\n? = 0.58 \n\n? = 0.77 \n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6.18 \u2013 Cycle average casing heat gain at different regenerator\npositions (finite volumes) for: (a) Different ?THex for ? ? 0.38 and f =\n0.25 Hz; (b) Different operating frequencies for ? ? 0.38 and ?THex =\n25 K; (c) Different utilization factors for f = 0.25 Hz and ?THex = 25\nK.\n\nIncreasing the utilization factor for a fixed frequency and ?THex,\nFig. 6.18(c), causes a somewhat different effect on the casing heat gain\nin a given volume. In this case, as ? increases and the effectiveness\ndecreases, different temperature profiles are established along the re-\ngenerator. As a result, the local heat gain presents a high dependence\non the local temperature difference (at each finite volume) and on the\nincreasing heat transfer coefficient due to the higher mass flow rate. In\nturn, the cycle average cooling capacity, presented in Table 6.3, showed\nthat increasing ? increases the penalties with respect to the no loss\ncooling capacity.\n\nAll the results and discussions presented above clearly show that the\ncasing heat gain changes the local thermal equilibrium along the re-\ngenerative matrix and reduces the refrigerating effect of the AMR.\n\n\n\n6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 251\n\nTable 6.3 \u2013 Impact of the casing heat gain on the cycle average cooling\ncapacity for different values of ?, for f = 0.25 Hz and ?THex of 25 K.\n\n?

Considering f = 0.25 Hz and ? ? 0.38, while the experiments\ngave the smallest maximum ?THex, Fig. 6.15, the zero-loss model gave\nthe highest maximum ?THex for all conditions, Fig. 6.17. However,\nwhen the casing heat gain is included in the simulations, a reduction of\nthe potential cooling capacity of the order of 3 W is already sufficient to\nreduce the maximum temperature span to 35 K, as shown in Fig. 6.17.\n\nWhen the non-uniformity in the magnetic field (MF) is incorporated in\nthe model (CHG+MF losses), the local magnetic field is reduced, which\ncauses an almost uniform decrease in the characteristic curves. The\nconsideration of an axial magnetic flux density profile is important for\nthe local demagnetization loss, which depends on the applied magnetic\nflux density and the local temperature of the regenerator matrix.\n\nFinally, the inclusion of the void volume (VV) losses modifies even\n\nfurther the trends of the Q?C vs. ?THex curves, improving consid-\nerably the prediction of the experimental results. The following re-\nmarks can be made based on an analysis of the results considering the\nCHG+MF+VV losses in Fig. 6.17:\n\n1. For ?THex > 15 K, the characteristic curves exhibit a fairly linear\ntrend, but with a different inclination in comparison with the\nsimulated cases in which the VV was not included;\n\n2. For ?THex &lt;15 K, all characteristic curves show a clear deviation\nfrom the linear trend;\n\n\n\n252 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\n3. For ?THex = 0, the numerical results with the CHG+MF+VV\n\nlosses gave higher values of the maximum Q?C.\n\nTo facilitate the interpretation of the points explained above, Fig. 6.19\npresents a comparison between the numerical results and the experi-\nmental data for the time-dependent temperatures at the hot and cold\nends for different operating conditions. Fig. 6.19(a) shows results for\ndifferent ?THex and Fig. 6.19(b) for ?THex ? 0. The following remarks\ncan be made:\n\n1. The AMR model showed good predictions of the time-dependent\ntemperatures at the hot and cold ends;\n\n2. Comparing the experimental and numerical results for THE and\nTCE, it is clearly seen that they are not symmetric, i.e., the peak of\nTHE has a smooth round shape, while TCE has a sharp valley. This\nbehavior is caused by the angular (or time) dependence of the\nmagnetic flux density in Nested Halbach cylinders (see Figs 3.10\nand 3.15). During the hot cycle (0 ? t? ? 180o) the magnetic\nflux density varies smoothly and during the cold cycle (180o ?\nangle ? 360o) a sharp change is observed. The MCE resulting\nfrom this magnetic field variation clearly has an impact on the\ntemperature of the fluid leaving the regenerator bed at THE and\nTCE;\n\n3. The discontinuities caused by the void volume on the time-depen-\ndent temperature are clearly visible, such as for TCE at t\n\n? ? 0.\n\nAs in passive regenerators, the existence of void volumes on each side of\nthe AMR alters the temperature boundary conditions of the regenerator\nthermal balance. However, contrary to the passive regenerator case,\nthe void volume influence on the temperature boundary conditions can\nsometimes improve the AMR performance.\n\nTo explain how the void volume influences the AMR performance, it\nis necessary to understand the behavior of the TC data (green open\nsquare symbols) in Fig. 6.19. If the values of TCE corresponding to the\nfluid trapped in the void volume are below TC, then the fluid returns to\nthe regenerator at a temperature lower than that of the cold reservoir.\n\n\n\n6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 253\n\nt* = 2?ft [-]\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n [\nK\n\n]\n\n278\n\n280\n\n282\n\n284\n\n286\n\n288\n\n290\n\n292\n\n294\n\n296\n\n298\n\n300\n\n302\n\n? 2? 3? 4? ? 2? 3? 4? ? 2? 3? 4?\n\n  Exp.

This\n\nwas the case for the maximum Q?C conditions shown in Fig. 6.19(b),\n\nwhich explains the improvement of the maximum Q?C observed when\nthe void volume is included in the simulations.\n\nOn the other hand, if the values of TCE corresponding to the fluid\ntrapped in the void volume are above TC, as in some cases of Fig. 6.19(a),\nthe fluid that returns to the regenerator is warmer than the cold reser-\nvoir, which reduces the cooling capacity of the AMR. This explains the\nreduction of the maximum ?THex when the void volume was included\n\non the simulations. The intermediate points of the Q?C vs. ?THex curves\ncan represent one of these two situations. However, it should be noted\nthat the temperature of the fluid exiting the regenerator is extremely\ndependent on the void volume size, operating parameters, thermophys-\nical and magnetocaloric properties of the regenerative material, and\nregenerator effectiveness.\n\nFig. 6.20 presents a comparison between the numerical results including\n\nthe CHG+MF+VV losses and the experimental data for Q?C as a func-\ntion of ? and ?THex. Each plot corresponds to a different frequency.\nThe following remarks can be made:\n\n1. For f = 0.25 Hz, the numerical results are in very good agree-\nment with the experimental data for all values of utilization. A\nmaximum deviation of 3 W was found for the largest value of\nutilization;\n\n2. For f = 0.5 and 1 Hz, the numerical results reproduced the ex-\nperimental trends quite well. However, for some values of ?THex,\nthe model overestimates the experimental cooling capacity, for\nwhich a maximum deviation of 9 W was observed at high values\nof utilization;\n\n3. For some ?THex at the smallest utilizations, especially for f =\n0.5 and 1 Hz, the numerical results overestimated the cooling\ncapacity by as much as 10 W;\n\n4.

This is exactly the region\nwhere the void volume has a major impact on the AMR performance\n\nand the Q?C vs. ?THex curves deviate from their linear behavior (see\nFig. 6.17). Possibly, if the experimental tests were performed with a\nbetter resolution, i.e., using smaller cooling capacity steps in the region\n5 &lt;?THex &lt;15 K, the agreement could be improved.\n\nRegarding item 3, this corresponds to the same operating condition\nin the passive regenerator tests in which a no flow period was verified\nfor smallest pumped volumes (see Sections 5.1.2 and 5.4). However,\ncontrary to what has been observed for passive regenerators results, in\nthe AMR tests a smaller mass flow rate reduces the cooling capacity,\nwhich explains the over prediction of the numerical results.\n\n\n\n6.5 Spheres Packed Bed Regenerator 257\n\nFig. 6.21 shows comparisons between the experimental data and nu-\nmerical results for the maximum ?THex as a function of ? for the three\nfrequencies. The numerical results are presented for two situations: (i)\nwithout losses and (ii) with the CHG+MF+VV losses. As mentioned\nin Section 6.5.1.3, it is quite common in the literature to attribute the\nreduction of the maximum ?THex at small ? to axial heat conduction\nin the matrix (NIELSEN et al., 2011; TUSEK et al., 2011). However, the\nmodel without losses already takes into account axial heat conduction\nin the fluid and solid phases. As can be seen, the no-loss numerical\nresults severely overestimate the experimental data. Clearly, the de-\npendence of the maximum ?THex on the utilization factor results from\na combination of different losses in the AMR, axial heat conduction be-\ning one of them. The incorporation of the casing heat gain, magnetic\nflux density non-uniformity and void volume losses improves significant\nthe prediction of the experimental data for ?THex as a function of the\nutilization factor. An analysis of the numerical results revealed that\nthe casing heat gain was the main contributing factor to the reduction\nof the AMR performance in the present experiments. Based on the\nanalysis presented in this section, the following recommendations can\nbe made regarding the design of AMR systems:\n\n1. A systematic evaluation/quantification of the thermal-hydraulic\nand magnetic losses is a powerful tool to improve AMR design;\n\n2. The inclusion of the different types of losses in numerical models\nfor AMR systems is of paramount importance. Without them, a\nrobust and reliable analysis of the results is not possible;\n\n3. The thermal insulation of the AMR is an important additional\nparameter to be taken into account in the design and evaluation\nof AMRs. This way, possible design strategies could involve the\noptimization of the AMR cross sectional area together with the\nthermal insulation thickness, so that the reduction of the sectional\narea can be compensated by a better thermal insulation of the\nregenerator assembly.\n\n\n\n258 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \n\n?\nT\n\nH\ne\n\nx\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n    Experimental\n No Losses\n Wall + MF + VV Losses\n\n(a)\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \n\n?\nT\n\nH\ne\n\nx\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n    Experimental\n No Losses\n Wall + MF + VV Losses\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n6.6 Performance Assessment of Different Matrix Geometries 259\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \n\n?\nT\n\nH\ne\n\nx\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n    Experimental\n No Losses\n Wall + MF + VV Losses\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6.21 \u2013 Numerical results (solid lines) and experimental data\n(symbols) for ?THex as a function of ? for TH = 300 K: (a) f = 0.25\nHz; (b) f = 0.5 Hz; (c) f = 1 Hz.\n\n6.6 Performance Assessment of Different\nMatrix Geometries\n\nThis section presents comparisons of the AMR performance for three\nGd matrices: (i) Spheres #4, which consists of a packed bed of 0.78-\nmm Gd spheres assembled in Casing #4, (ii) Plates #5 and (iii) Pins\n#6. The geometric properties and characteristics of these matrices\nare presented in Table 3.9. The performance analysis is based on the\n\nbehavior of Q?C, COP and ?2nd as a function of ? for different values\nof ?THex. In the present analysis, ?THex was varied from 3 to 18 K, in\nsteps of 3 K. As in the experimental analysis for the Spheres #3 matrix,\ninterpolating functions were used to transform the characteristic curves\n\ninto curves of Q?C as a function of ?, having ?THex as a parameter.\n\n\n\n260 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nThe experimental uncertainties associated with the measurements in\nall geometries evaluated in this section are similar to those for the\nSpheres #3 tests.\n\nAs in the passive regenerator experiments, the three matrix geometries\nhave approximately the same equivalent particle diameter and porosity.\nThe results for the cooling capacity as a function of utilization for f =\n0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz, are shown in Figs. 6.22 to Fig. 6.24. Figs. 6.25\nto Fig. 6.27 show the results for the COP as a function of ? for f =\n0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz. Figs. 6.28 to 6.30 present the results for ?2nd as a\nfunction of ? for f = 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz.\n\nBefore starting the performance analysis, it is important to mention\nthat, since the void volume size is about the same for the three re-\ngenerators, its impact on the AMR performance comparison can be\ndisregarded. Also, the gadolinium used to manufacture the spheres\nand the pins and plates came from different suppliers, and there is no\ninformation regarding the purity or the magnetocaloric properties of\nthe samples. Thus, the performance analysis does not take into ac-\ncount any difference regarding the MCE of the samples. Therefore, the\nfollowing comparisons take into consideration the effectiveness of the\nregenerative matrix, the demagnetization factor and the casing heat\ngain.\n\nThe parameters associated with the demagnetization factor, namely\nND,geo, ND,csg and ND (see Eq. (4.49)) are presented in Table 6.4. Al-\nthough a single plate or pin presents a much smaller ND,geo compared\nwith a single sphere, the value of ND,csg counterbalances the overall de-\nmagnetization factor. As a result, the difference between the maximum\nand minimum ND is of the order of 0.11, with the pin array presenting\nthe lowest overall demagnetizing factor.\n\nTable 6.4 \u2013 Demagnetizing factors for the different AMR matrices.\n\nMatrix ND,geo [-] ND,csg [-] ND [-]\n\nSpheres #4 0.330 0.466 0.417\nPins 0.020 0.470 0.302\n\nPlates 0.033 0.470 0.313\n\nThe cooling capacity results in Figs. 6.22 to Fig. 6.24 reveal that, for\nall operating frequencies, the parallel plate AMR presented a poorer\nperformance when compared with the remaining geometries. Only at\n\nthe smallest utilization Q?C for this geometry was comparable to the\n\n\n\n6.6 Performance Assessment of Different Matrix Geometries 261\n\nresults for pins and spheres, which is consistent with the thermal ef-\nfectiveness results for the passive geometries shown in Section 5.3.4.\nSince the demagnetization factor for the plate geometry is smaller than\nfor the packed bed of spheres and very close to that for the pin array,\nthe poorer AMR performance cannot be attributed to magnetic losses,\nso the casing heat gain appears to be the main contributing factor to\nthe comparatively low cycle-average cooling capacity. In the plate ge-\nometry, there is a large fraction of the matrix area in direct contact\nwith the ABS casing, i.e., the two sides and the continuous base. This\ncertainly contributes a lot to increasing the casing heat gain.\n\nThe pin and packed sphere matrices exhibited similar cooling capacity\nperformances. For a fixed ?THex, the packed bed has a slightly higher\ncooling capacity, especially for f = 1 Hz. This is also in agreement\nwith the passive regenerator effectiveness results. On the other hand,\nsince the pin array has a smaller demagnetizing factor than the packed\nbed, it may be that the heat gain is higher in the pin array matrix than\nin the packed bed. As in the plate matrix, the pin array also has a\ncontinuous base in contact with the ABS housing, which can increase\nthe heat gain. Somehow, the demagnetizing field and the casing heat\ngain effects counterbalance each other, and both geometries present\nsimilar performances curves. Only for f = 1 Hz, it seems that the casing\nheat gain for the pins is higher than the effect of the demagnetizing field\nfor the packed bed, which seems to agree with the discussion in Section\n6.5.2.\n\nBefore addressing the results for the COP as a function of the utiliza-\ntion, Figs. 6.25 to Fig. 6.27, it is important to observe that: (i) since the\ntotal mass of Gd in the three regenerators is approximately the same,\nand since the AMR performance is evaluated at a fixed TC, the varia-\n\ntion of W? Mag can be neglected when the three matrices are compared;\n(ii) from the passive regenerator results, the three matrices presented\ndifferent values of pressure drop, with the parallel plate regenerator\npresenting the lowest and the packed bed the highest pumping power.\nThus, for a fixed TC, the total power can be compared among the dif-\nferent geometries only in terms of the pumping power contribution.\n\nThe parallel plate regenerator presents the smallest values of W? due to\nthe smallest viscous losses. However, its performance is the poorest in\ncomparison with the other matrices, resulting in the smallest COP . On\nthe other hand, since the pumping power for the pin array is smaller\nthan in the packed bed, the COP for the pins is a bit higher than for\n\n\n\n262 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nthe spheres, especially at higher values of ?THex and lower frequencies\n(0.25 and 0.5 Hz). For f = 1 Hz the pin and packed sphere geometries\npresent basically the same results for the COP .\n\nAs expected, the second-law efficiency, Figs. 6.28 to Fig. 6.30, follows\nsimilar trends as the COP , with the pin array showing slightly higher\nvalues of ?2nd for 0.25 and 0.5 Hz, while for 1 Hz, the pins and spheres\npresented very similar results. Taking the frequency of 0.5 Hz as an\nexample, the following remarks can be made:\n\n1. For the parallel plates, a peak ?2nd of approximately 3% was\n\nobserved for a ?THex of 9 K and ? ? 0.32, Q?C ? 3.5 W (40\nW/kg) and COP of 0.9;\n\n2. For the packed bed of spheres, a peak ?2nd of approximately 5%\nwas observed for ?THex of 12 K and 15 K and ? ? 0.5. Consid-\nering ?THex = 12 K, Q?C ? 5.5 W (65.6 W/kg) with a COP of\nabout 1.2;\n\n3. For the pin array, a peak ?2nd of approximately 5.5% was observed\nfor ?THex of 12 K and 15 K and ? ? 0.5. Considering ?THex =\n12 K, Q?C ? 5.25 W (58.5 W/kg) with a COP of about 1.4;\n\n\n\n6.6 Performance Assessment of Different Matrix Geometries 263\n\nU\nti\n\nli\nza\n\nti\no\n\nn\n F\n\na\nc\n\nto\nr \n\n[-\n]\n\nCycle Average Cooling Capacity [W]\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n.4\n\n0\n.6\n\n0\n.8\n\n1\n1\n\n.2\n1\n\n.4\n1\n\n.6\n1\n\n.8\n01234567\n\nU\nti\n\nli\nza\n\nti\no\n\nn\n F\n\na\nc\n\nto\nr \n\n[-\n]\n\nCycle Average Cooling Capacity [W]\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n.4\n\n0\n.6\n\n0\n.8\n\n1\n1\n\n.2\n1\n\n.4\n012345\n\nU\nti\n\nli\nza\n\nti\no\n\nn\n F\n\na\nc\n\nto\nr \n\n[-\n]\n\nCycle Average Cooling Capacity [W]\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n.4\n\n0\n.6\n\n0\n.8\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n.51\n\n1\n.52\n\n2\n.53\n\n3\n.54\n\nU\nti\n\nli\nza\n\nti\no\n\nn\n F\n\na\nc\n\nto\nr \n\n[-\n]\n\nCycle Average Cooling Capacity [W]\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n.4\n\n0\n.6\n\n0\n.8\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n.51\n\n1\n.52\n\n2\n.53\n\n3\n.5\n\nU\nti\n\nli\nza\n\nti\no\n\nn\n F\n\na\nc\n\nto\nr \n\n[-\n]\n\nCycle Average Cooling Capacity [W]\n\n0\n.2\n\n0\n.4\n\n0\n.6\n\n0\n.8\n\n0\n\n0\n.51\n\n1\n.52\n\n2\n.53\n\n \n P\n\nla\nte\n\ns\n\n S\np\n\nh\ne\n\nre\ns\n\n P\nin\n\ns\n?\n\nT\nH\n\ne\nx\n =\n\n 3\n K\n\n \n P\n\nla\nte\n\ns\n\n S\np\n\nh\ne\n\nre\ns\n\n P\nin\n\ns\n?\n\nT\nH\n\ne\nx\n =\n\n 6\n K\n\n S\np\n\nh\ne\n\nre\ns\n\n P\nin\n\ns\n?\n\nT\nH\n\ne\nx\n =\n\n 9\n K\n\n S\np\n\nh\ne\n\nre\ns\n\n P\nin\n\ns\n?\n\nT\nH\n\ne\nx\n =\n\n 1\n5\n\n K\n S\n\np\nh\n\ne\nre\n\ns\n P\n\nin\ns\n\n?\nT\n\nH\ne\n\nx\n =\n\n 1\n2\n\n K\n\nFigure 6.22 \u2013 Q?C as a function of ?

for the three matrix geometries:\nf = 1 Hz, TH = 300 K and different ?THex.\n\n\n\n272 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nFig. 6.31 presents a comparison between the AMR regenerator geome-\ntries regarding the maximum ?THex as a function of ? for the different\nfrequencies of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 Hz. As performed for Spheres #3, the\nmaximum ?THex was determined from an extrapolation/interpolation\nof the system curves. The trends are somewhat similar to those for\nSpheres#3, allowing the following remarks to be made:\n\n1. For all the geometries, the points of maximum ?THex are found\nat small utilization factors. This corroborates the assumption\nthat the regenerators assembled in Casings #4, #5 and #6 have\nlower casing heat gains because of their better thermal insulation,\nowing to the additional ABS housing, compared with Casing #3;\n\n2. For all the frequencies, the points of maximum temperature span\nfor the parallel plate geometry were always lower than for the\nremaining geometries. This supports the argument of a larger\ncasing heat gain for the plates geometry.\n\nAll geometries showed their best performance, in terms of the maximum\n?THex, at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. These results are supported by the\nfollowing points: (i) at this frequency, the regenerator effectiveness is\nhigher than at 1 Hz; (ii) as shown in item (1) above, the casing heat\ngain is smaller for Casings #4, #5 and #6 than for Casing #3 (used\nin Spheres #3). In the case of Spheres #3, this matrix also presented\na higher effectiveness at 0.5 Hz, however, since the casing heat gain\npresents a larger impact on the regenerator performance, the frequency\nof 1 Hz showed a higher maximum ?THex.\n\nRegarding the utilization factor, for f = 0.25 and 0.5 Hz, comparing\nthe pins and spheres matrices, it is observed that for small ? the pins\npresented a larger maximum ?THex, while for ? > 1 the packed spheres\nmatrix had a higher maximum ?THex. This result can be attributed\nfirst to the higher effectiveness (smaller axial heat conduction loss) and\nlower demagnetizing loss of the pin array geometry at low utilizations\nand high temperature spans. As the utilization increases and the tem-\nperature span decreases, the spheres packed bed thermal performance\nimproves, given the reduction of the axial heat condition and demag-\nnetizing losses, and due to a better effectiveness of this matrix at high\nutilizations. For f = 1 Hz, both geometries presented the same values\nof maximum ?THex which can be attributed to the higher heat gain\nfor the pin array, as explained previously in this section.\n\n\n\n6.6 Performance Assessment of Different Matrix Geometries 273\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \n\n?\nT\n\nH\ne\n\nx\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n Spheres\n\n Plates\n Pins\n\n(a)\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \n\n?\nT\n\nH\ne\n\nx\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n Spheres\n\n Plates\n Pins\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n274 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \n\n?\nT\n\nH\ne\n\nx\n [\n\nK\n]\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n Spheres\n\n Plates\n Pins\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6.31 \u2013 Comparison of the maximum ?THex as a function of ?\nfor each AMR regenerator geometry and TH = 300 K: (a) f = 0.25 Hz;\n(b) f = 0.5 Hz; (c) f = 1 Hz.\n\nFig. 6.32 makes a comparison of the maximum Q?C as a function of the\nutilization factor for all regenerative matrices, for the three frequen-\ncies.

Moreover, in terms of the maximum Q?C,\nthe spheres regenerator presented a better performance, especially at\nhigher utilizations, where this geometry is the most thermally effective\nin terms of heat transfer. Also, at TH = 300 K and zero span, the axial\nheat conduction and the demagnetizing effects are lower, contributing\nto a better performance of the spheres packed beds.\n\n\n\n6.6 Performance Assessment of Different Matrix Geometries 275\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \nC\n\ny\nc\n\nle\n A\n\nv\ne\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n C\n\no\no\n\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nSpheres\n\nPlates\n\nPins\n\n(a)\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \nC\n\ny\nc\n\nle\n A\n\nv\ne\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n C\n\no\no\n\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nSpheres\n\nPlates\n\nPins\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n276 6 Active Magnetic Regenerators\n\nUtilization Factor [-]\n\nM\na\n\nx\n. \nC\n\ny\nc\n\nle\n A\n\nv\ne\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n C\n\no\no\n\nli\nn\n\ng\n C\n\na\np\n\na\nc\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nW\n\n]\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\nSpheres\n\nPlates\n\nPins\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6.32 \u2013 Comparison of the maximum Q?C as a function of ? for\neach AMR regenerator geometry and TH = 300 K: (a) f = 0.25 Hz; (b)\nf = 0.5 Hz; (c) f = 1 Hz.\n\nIn conclusion, the pin array and the packed bed of spheres are the most\npromising regenerative geometries for magnetic refrigeration. If, on the\none hand, the packed bed presented slightly higher cooling capacities,\non the other hand, the pin array had lower penalties associated with\nthe viscous losses and, as a consequence, a little higher values of COP\nand ?2nd. However, considering the manufacturing of the regenerator,\nthe packed bed of spheres is by far the best option for applications\nin AMRs. The WEDM technique employed to fabricate the pin array\nis still time consuming and expensive to be considered for large scale\nproduction.\n\n\n\n277\n\n7 Optimization of Thermal\nRegenerators\n\nThe thermodynamic efficiencies of regenerative cooling cycles are di-\nrectly linked to the heat transfer effectiveness and viscous losses in the\nregenerator. In a heat exchanger, there must be good thermal con-\ntact between the fluid and solid phases, but the latter should offer a\nsmall resistance to the fluid flow. These conflicting requirements are\noften equalized using thermal optimization. A regenerator can be de-\nsigned for optimal performance according to the Entropy Generation\nMinimization (EGM) method (BEJAN, 1996). In active magnetic re-\ngenerators, the structure and geometry of the solid matrix have to\nbe optimized to reduce the thermal, viscous and magnetic losses and\nachieve the desired operating conditions of temperature span, cooling\ncapacity and cycle efficiency.\n\nThe present chapter advances a performance analysis of thermal pas-\nsive and active magnetic regenerators based on the Entropy Genera-\ntion Minimization (EGM) theory. The cycle-average entropy genera-\ntion contributions are due to: axial heat conduction, fluid friction and\ninterstitial heat transfer. It is important to notice that, in the cases\nwhere the magnetocaloric effect is reversible and does not present irre-\nversibilities like magnetic and thermal hysteresis, there is no additional\n(i.e., magnetic) contribution to the cycle-average entropy generation.\nThe influences of parameters such as the mass flow rate, operating\nfrequency, regenerator cross sectional area, housing aspect ratio, uti-\nlization factor and particle diameter are evaluated according to the fol-\nlowing performance evaluation criteria (PEC): variable geometry (VG)\nand fixed face (cross-section) area (FA).\n\n\n\n278 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\n7.1 Entropy Generation Model\n\nIn a thermal regenerator, entropy is generated due to heat transfer and\nviscous dissipation.

The fourth term is the rate of en-\ntropy generation in the control volume, and S\n\n???\nis local rate of entropy\n\ngeneration per unit volume during a cycle.

(7.2) to (7.4) in Eq. (7.1) and using the heat fluxes\ndefined above (Eqs.

(7.8)\nwhere the first term on the right is the entropy generation rate per\nunit volume due to interphase heat transfer with a finite temperature\ndifference. The second and third terms are the entropy generation rates\ndue to axial conduction in the fluid and solid matrix, and the fourth\nterm is the entropy generation rate per unit volume due to viscous\nfriction.

(7.8) is used to calculate\nthe local rate of entropy generation per unit volume in passive and ac-\ntive magnetic regenerators. In cases where the magnetocaloric effect is\nreversible, such as in materials with a continuous magnetic transition\n(e.g., gadolinium), the local rate of entropy generation due to the MCE\nis directly included in the interphase heat transfer. In this case, the\n?Tad resulting from the external magnetic flux density variation cre-\nates a finite temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases.\nOtherwise, if irreversibilities are present, such as magnetic and thermal\nhysteresis, additional terms have to be included in Eq. (7.8) to com-\npute these irreversibilities. However, these will not be necessary in the\npresent thesis, as Gd is the magnetocaloric material being considered.\n\n\n\n7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-Flow Regenerators 281\n\n7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-\nFlow Regenerators\n\nThis section presents and discusses the results for the optimization of\npassive oscillating-flow regenerators. The analysis considers packed bed\nmatrices composed by stainless steel spheres of different sizes. To the\nfluid phase was considered as pure water.\n\n7.2.1 Performance Evaluation Criteria for Passive\nRegenerators\n\nThe EGM calculations were carried out based on the PEC of Webb and\nKim (WEBB; KIM, 2005). The first criterion is of Variable Geometry\n(VG), for which the regenerator housing cross sectional area, or the\nhousing diameter, Dh,Reg, and the length, LReg, are allowed to vary,\nkeeping a constant housing volume. The second criterion is of Fixed\nFace Area (FA), where the regenerator housing cross sectional area is\nkept constant and the regenerator length can vary, thus changing also\nthe housing volume. For reasons that will be discussed later, the Fixed\nGeometry (FG) criterion was not evaluated for passive regenerators.\nThe baseline (reference) housing geometry has the following geometric\ncharacteristics: Dh,Reg = 25 mm and ? = 2, where ? = Lreg/Dh,Reg is\nthe aspect ratio of the regenerator housing. Thus, the baseline regen-\nerator housing volume is 24.544 cm3, and the ranges of the variables\nexplored in the analysis are presented in Table 7.1. A flow chart of\nthe various scenarios is shown in Fig. 7.2. The operating conditions\n(i.e., frequency and mass flow rates) and ranges of geometric parame-\nters evaluated were chosen so as to be consistent with figures currently\nencountered in active magnetic regenerators (YU et al., 2010; NIELSEN\net al., 2011).\n\nTable 7.1 \u2013 Ranges of the geometric variables for each PEC of the\npassive regenerator optimization.\n\nPEC Dh,Reg [mm] ?

The particle diameter is varied from 0.2 to 2 mm, for each possi-\nble combination. In the FA criterion, Dh,Reg is fixed at 25 mm, while\n? is changed from 1 to 8. The particle diameter is also varied from 0.2\nto 2 mm for each possible combination.\n\nFor each combination of Dh,Reg, ? and dp in each PEC, simulations were\ncarried out considering two different scenarios. In the first scenario, the\nfrequency was kept constant at 1 Hz and the mass flow rate was varied\nfrom 40 to 100 kg/h (steps of 10 kg/h) for the VG PEC and from 100\nto 300 kg/h (steps of 25 kg/h) for the FA PEC, as presented in Table\n7.2. In the second scenario, the frequency was varied from 1 to 4 Hz\n(steps of 0.5 Hz) and the mass flow rate was kept constant at 60 kg/h\nfor the VG PEC and at 250 kg/h for the FA PEC, as presented in\nTable 7.3.\n\nAs defined previously, the regenerator effectiveness is a measure of the\nrate at which heat is transferred between the fluid and solid phases in\n\n\n\n7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-Flow Regenerators 283\n\nTable 7.2 \u2013 Constraints of the regenerator analysis for the VG and FA\nPEC for a fixed frequency and a variable mass flow rate in the passive\nregenerator optimization.\n\nVariable Value or range Units\n? 0.36 -\nTH 283 K\nTC 323 K\n? 0.95 -\nf 1 Hz\n\nVG - m? 40 - 100 (?m? = 10) kg/h\nVG - ? 0.40 - 0.99 -\nFA - m? 100 - 300 (?m? = 25) kg/h\nFA - ?

In the VG and FA PEC,\na fixed regenerator effectiveness is equivalent to a fixed heat transfer\nrate when the temperatures of the reservoirs and the frequency or the\nmass flow rate are fixed (Tables 7.2 and 7.3). In the present analyses,\na target value for ? was set at 95% (performance constraint).\n\nIn the VG cases, for fixed values of frequency, mass flow rate and uti-\nlization, the regenerator effectiveness will change as a result of changes\nin Dh,Reg and ? (which are reciprocal because of the constant housing\n\n\n\n284 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\nvolume constraint) or dp. Changes in cross-section area affect the fluid\nsuperficial velocity, the particle Reynolds number (which is also affected\nby dp) and the magnitude of the axial heat conduction. The surface\narea per unit volume is directly affected by the particle diameter. In\nthe FA cases, the interstitial heat transfer coefficient is only a function\nof dp, since the superficial velocity is constant for a given mass flow\nrate. On the other hand, the interstitial area changes with both dp and\n?. The utilization factor decreases with increasing ?, which contributes\nto achieving higher values of regenerator effectiveness due to the larger\nthermal mass of the solid phase.\n\nIt should be noted that the Fixed Geometry (FG) PEC (WEBB; KIM,\n2005), i.e., that in which both the regenerator length and cross-section\narea are kept fixed, could not be evaluated given the present constraints\nbecause fixing a value of ? in this case does not necessarily correspond\nto a fixed cycle-average heat transfer rate.\n\n7.2.2 PEC Numerical Implementation\n\nEach operating condition is defined by a set of constraints specified\naccording to Table 7.2 (variable mass flow rate) or Table 7.3 (variable\nfrequency). For a specific operating condition, the ranges of the geo-\nmetric variables (e.g., housing and particle diameters and aspect ratio)\nare chosen according to each PEC (VG or FA), as shown in Table 7.1.\nFor each point in the range associated with a given PEC, the momen-\ntum and energy equations are solved numerically and the cycle-average\nentropy generation is calculated.\n\nFor each scenario of the VG PEC (i.e., variable frequency or variable\nmass flow rate), discrete data points were selected in the housing diam-\neter and particle diameter ranges shown in Table 7.1 (incremental steps\nof 5 mm for Dh,Reg and 0.1 mm for dp), resulting in 266 independent\ncases. Similarly, for the FA PEC, the aspect ratio range was divided in\nincremental steps of 0.5 (plus the 0.1 mm steps for dp), resulting in 342\ncases for the variable frequency and variable mass flow rate scenarios.\nIn total, 9196 different simulations were performed for the VG and FA\nPEC. The searches for the points of minimum entropy generation were\nrefined further by means of 4th-order (or less) polynomial interpola-\ntions (R2 > 0.9999), which guaranteed the stability of the numerical\nsolutions and a better resolution (finer than 0.5 mm for Dh,Reg, 0.05\nfor ? and 0.01 mm for dp) for the minimum Sg value at a reasonable\n\n\n\n7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-Flow Regenerators 285\n\ncomputational cost.\n\n7.2.3 Entropy Generation-Effectiveness Contour\nMaps\n\nAs the numerical convergence is obtained for the momentum and en-\nergy equations for a specific case (defined by values of frequency, mass\nflow rate and geometric parameters associated with each PEC), the\nregenerator configurations that yield the desired value of hot-blow ef-\nfectiveness can be identified. To illustrate this, Fig. 7.3 presents the\nresults for the VG PEC with m? = 60 kg/h and frequencies of 1 and 3\nHz. Fig. 7.4, in turn, presents the results for the FA PEC with m? = 250\nkg/h and frequencies of 1 and 3 Hz. Lines of constant Sg (red lines)\nare plotted together with lines of constant effectiveness (blue lines), as\na function of the particle diameter and housing diameter for the VG\nPEC (Fig. 7.3), and particle diameter and housing aspect ratio for the\nFA PEC (Fig. 7.4).\n\nAs can be seen from Figs. 7.3 and 7.4, the target value of ? = 95% (blue\nsolid line) can be achieved with different combinations of dp and Dh,Reg\nor ?, with f and m? being held constant for each PEC. According to\nthe VG PEC with m? = 60 kg/h and f = 1 Hz, Fig. 7.3(a), ? = 95%\ncan be achieved with small values of dp in the 0.2 to 1.3 mm range and\nsmall housing diameters (12.5 to 58 mm), yielding values of ? between\n0.16 and 16. Following the line of constant hot-blow effectiveness of\n95%, different values of Sg can be achieved with a minimum at around\ndp = 1.07 mm and Dh,Reg = 17.23 mm. As the operating frequency is\nincreased, Fig. 7.3(b), the minimum Sg for ? = 95% is shifted to larger\nvalues of dp, yielding other combinations of Dh,Reg and ?.\n\nFor the FA PEC with m? = 250 kg/h and f = 1 Hz, Fig. 7.4(a), the\nminimum Sg for ? = 95% was identified in the vicinity of dp = 0.59 mm,\nwith an aspect ratio of around 5.12. As expected, for other frequencies\nthe minimum Sg range changes and ? = 95% is achieved with other\ncombinations of dp, Dh,Reg and ?, as presented in Fig. 7.4(b).\n\n\n\n286 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\n0.85\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n0.95\n\n0.95\n\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.025\n\n0.025\n\n0.025\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0.075\n\n0.075\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.125\n\n0.125\n\n0.15\n\n0.15\n\n0.175\n0.2\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nH\nou\n\nsi\nng\n\nD\nia\n\nm\net\n\ner\n[m\n\nm\n]\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n(a)\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n0.95\n\n0.95\n\n0.005\n\n0.005\n\n0.0075\n\n0.0075\n\n0.0075\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n0.015\n\n0.015\n\n0.0\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.02\n\n0.025\n\n0.025\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nH\nou\n\nsi\nng\n\nD\nia\n\nm\net\n\ner\n[m\n\nm\n]\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.3 \u2013 Lines of constant effectiveness (blue lines) and Sg (red\nlines) as a function of dp and Dh,Reg for the VG PEC for m? = 60 kg/h\nand frequencies of (a) 1 Hz; (b) 3 Hz.\n\n\n\n7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-Flow Regenerators 287\n\n0.85\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n5\n\n0.\n95\n\n.11\n\n0.\n11\n\n0.\n11\n\n0.\n11\n\n5\n\n0.1\n15\n\n0.\n11\n\n5\n\n0.\n12\n\n5\n\n0.\n12\n\n5\n\n0.\n12\n\n5\n\n0.15\n\n0.\n15\n\n0.1\n5\n\n0.\n15\n\n0.\n15\n\n0.\n17\n\n5\n0.\n\n17\n5\n\n0.1\n75\n\n0.1\n75\n\n0.175\n\n0.\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.\n25\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n5\n\n0.2\n5\n\n0.\n3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nA\nsp\n\nec\ntR\n\nat\nio\n\n[-\n]\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n(a)\n\n0.85\n\n0.85\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.90.9\n5\n\n0.\n95\n\n0.\n95\n\n0.\n03\n\n5\n\n0.\n03\n\n5\n\n0.\n03\n\n5\n\n0.\n03\n\n5\n\n0.\n04\n\n0.\n04\n\n0.0\n4\n\n0.\n04\n\n0.\n04\n\n0.0\n5\n\n0.\n05\n\n0.0\n5\n\n0.\n05\n\n0.\n06\n\n0.0\n6\n\n0.0\n6\n\n0.0\n6\n\n0.\n07\n\n5\n\n0.07\n5\n\n0.0\n75\n\n0.0\n75\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.125\n\n0.15\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nA\nsp\n\nec\ntR\n\nat\nio\n\n[-\n]\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.4 \u2013 Lines of constant effectiveness (blue lines) and Sg (red\nlines) as a function of dp and ? for the FA PEC for m? = 250 kg/h and\nfrequencies of (a) 1 Hz; (b) 3 Hz.\n\n\n\n288 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\n7.2.4 Individual Contributions to the Total Entropy\nGeneration\n\nThis section illustrates the behavior of the three sources of entropy\ngeneration (interstitial heat transfer, axial conduction and viscous dis-\nsipation) for two regenerators with the same housing volume, but very\ndistinct values of housing diameter and aspect ratio, as seen in Table\n7.4. In these two cases, the particle diameter is varied between 0.2 and\n2 mm. The flow rate was 60 kg/h and the frequency was 1 Hz in both\ncases.

Case 1, Fig. 7.6(a), is a thin (small housing diameter) and long\nregenerator. As expected, the axial heat conduction contribution is\nvery small and the total entropy generation is basically a combination\nof viscous dissipation (because of the long matrix length and the high\nsuperficial velocity) and interstitial heat transfer. For small particle\ndiameters, viscous dissipation is the main source of entropy because of\nthe large values of pressure drop. As the particle diameter increases,\nthe pressure drop decreases but the interstitial heat transfer becomes\nless effective. As a result, the entropy generated due to a finite tempera-\nture difference between the solid and the fluid becomes more important.\nA local minimum Sg at a particle diameter of around 0.7 mm can be\nverified. However, at this point of minimum entropy generation, the\neffectiveness is slightly higher than the desired performance constraint\nof 95% effectiveness (see Fig. 7.5).\n\nCase 2, Fig. 7.6(b), illustrates an opposite situation, i.e., a large-diame-\nter short regenerator, for which the contributions of axial heat conduc-\ntion are expected to be more important because of the low superficial\nvelocity and the short regenerator length. The total entropy generation\nin Case 2 is a combination of the entropy production by axial heat con-\nduction and interstitial heat transfer. As shown in Fig. 7.6(b), for small\nparticle diameters, axial heat conduction in the solid is the main source\nof entropy generation. As the particle diameter increases, interstitial\nheat transfer is poorer and the dispersion axial conduction in the fluid\nphase becomes more important. In this case, the target effectiveness of\n95% is not achieved. It can be concluded, therefore, that this is a poor\nregenerator matrix, with low effectiveness and larger Sg values when\ncompared with Case 1.\n\n7.2.5 Variable Geometry (VG) Evaluation Criteria\n\n7.2.5.1 Fixed Frequency\n\nIn this section, the results for the VG PEC at a fixed frequency and\nvariable mass flow rate are presented as a function of changes in the\ngeometric parameters.

The\ndashed lines indicate the optimal values of dp, Dh,Reg and ? - 1.07 mm,\n17.23 mm and 6.11, respectively - that result in an effectiveness of 95%\nwith a minimum entropy production. Repeating the analysis for the\nother mass flow rates (see Table 7.2) gives the optimal combinations\nof dp, Dh,Reg and ? that guarantee a hot-blow effectiveness of 95%.\nThe results for the VG PEC for a fixed frequency and variable mass\nflow rates are further illustrated in Fig. 7.8.

As the interstitial heat\ntransfer is less effective (lower NTU and higher Sg,HT) and the viscous\nlosses are smaller for bigger particle diameters, long regenerative matri-\nces with smaller housing diameters are required in order to achieve the\n95% regenerator effectiveness, giving rise to the lowest contributions of\naxial conduction in the fluid and solid. On the other hand, for m? = 100\nkg/h the optimal region involves small particle diameters, larger hous-\ning diameters and smaller values of aspect ratio. Since at high mass\nflow rates and small particle diameters the viscous losses become more\nimportant (see the Sg,VD column), a big housing diameter is required\nto decrease the superficial velocity, which results in shorter matrices.\n\n\n\n7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-Flow Regenerators 293\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nS\ng\n\n [\nJ\n\n/K\n]\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.025\n\n0.03\n\n0.035\n\n0.04\n\n0.045\n\n0.05\n\n0.055\n\n40 kg/h\n\n50 kg/h\n\n60 kg/h\n\n70 kg/h\n\n80 kg/h\n\n90 kg/h100 kg/h\n\n(a)\n\nHousing Diameter [mm]\n\nS\ng\n\n [\nJ\n\n/K\n]\n\n15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.025\n\n0.03\n\n0.035\n\n0.04\n\n0.045\n\n0.05\n\n0.055\n\n40 kg/h\n\n50 kg/h\n\n60 kg/h\n\n70 kg/h\n\n80 kg/h\n\n90 kg/h\n\n100 kg/h\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n294 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\nAspect Ratio [-]\n\nS\ng\n\n [\nJ\n\n/K\n]\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.025\n\n0.03\n\n0.035\n\n0.04\n\n0.045\n\n0.05\n\n0.055\n\n40 kg/h\n\n50 kg/h\n\n60 kg/h\n\n70 kg/h\n\n80 kg/h\n\n100 kg/h 90 kg/h\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 7.8 \u2013 Minimum entropy analysis for the VG PEC for ? = 95%,\nfrequency of 1 Hz and variable flow rates in the range of 40-100 kg/h:\n(a) Sg as a function of dp; (b) Sg as a function of Dh,Reg; (c) Sg as a\nfunction of ?.\n\nNevertheless, smaller particle diameters are necessary to enhance the\ninterstitial heat transfer and guarantee an optimal performance of the\nregenerator, increasing NTU and decreasing Sg,HT. As a result, the ax-\nial conduction contributions become more important since the spheres\nsize becomes smaller and the superficial velocity decreases (see the\nSg,SAC and Sg,FAC columns).\n\nIn summary, Sg,HT was found to be the main contribution (in %) to the\ntotal entropy generation for the VG PEC at a fixed frequency (although\nits importance decreases with flow rate as the NTU increases). The\nsecond largest contribution is Sg,FAC, which increases with the flow\nrate since the matrices becomes shorter and the velocity decreases with\nincreasing housing diameters. The Sg,SAC and Sg,VD contributions are\nless important to Sg,min, with Sg,VD increasing with flow rate as a result\nof the decrease in particle diameter.\n\n\n\n7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-Flow Regenerators 295\n\n7.2.5.2 Fixed Mass Flow Rate\n\nThe results for the VG PEC at a fixed mass flow rate and variable\nfrequency (see Table 7.3) are presented as a function of changes in\nDh,Reg, ? and dp for a constant effectiveness of 95%.

In turn, larger housing diameters and shorter ma-\ntrices are needed to decrease the superficial velocity and reduce the\nviscous losses, which leads to significant axial conduction contributions\nto Sg,min. On the other hand, for f = 3.5 Hz the optimal region in-\nvolves bigger particle diameters, smaller housing diameters and larger\nvalues of the aspect ratio. Since the utilization factor decreases with\nincreasing frequency, bigger particle diameters, i.e., larger solid ther-\nmal mass, are sufficient to guarantee 95% effectiveness, even at lower\nvalues of the NTU. In general, at the highest frequencies, the effec-\ntiveness is higher than 95% due to the small values of the utilization\nfactor. Thus, longer regenerators are required to produce sufficiently\nlarge heat transfer areas and decrease the axial conduction losses. As\n\n\n\n298 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\na consequence, the housing diameter decreases.\n\nIt should be noted in Table 7.7 that for f = 4.0 Hz, a minimum Sg was\nnot found within the ranges of the simulated parameters. A comparison\nbetween the contributions of each term (in %) for the variable frequency\n(Table 7.8) and variable mass flow rate (Table 7.6) cases shows that\nthese are much more sensitive to variations in flow rate for a fixed\nfrequency.\n\n7.2.6 Fixed Face Area (FA) Evaluation Criteria\n\n7.2.6.1 Fixed Frequency\n\nThis section presents the results for the FA PEC for a fixed frequency\nand variable mass flow rate as a function of ? and dp. As mentioned\nabove, Dh,Reg is constant and kept fixed at 25 mm (see Table 7.2).\nAgain, the results are illustrated for a target effectiveness of 95%. The\nFA PEC is further explored in Fig. 7.10, which shows Sg as a function\nof dp and ? for mass flow rates ranging from 100 to 300 kg/h. Table\n7.9 summarizes the parameters associated with the optimal conditions\nfor each mass flow rate. Table 7.10 shows the individual contributions\nto the total entropy at the minimum, Sg,min.\n\nAs can be seen from the results, for m? = 100 kg/h the minimum Sg is\nassociated with a small particle diameter (dp = 0.21 mm) and a short\nmatrix (? = 1.674), while for m? = 300 kg/h the minimum Sg was ob-\nserved at a bigger particle diameter (dp = 0.80 mm) and a longer matrix\n(? = 7.003). As the mass flow rate is increased (increasing the super-\nficial velocity and Redp), the advection term becomes more important\nin the energy equation and the value of NTU is decreased. Therefore,\na longer regenerator (i.e., a larger interstitial area and a lower utiliza-\ntion factor) is required to keep the effectiveness at 95%. However, as\n? increases, a larger particle diameter is needed to compensate for the\nentropy generated due to the viscous dissipation.\n\nFor the FA PEC at a fixed frequency, Sg,HT and Sg,VD are the main\ncontributions (in %) to the total entropy generation. As the mass flow\nrate increases, NTU decreases and ? increases, making the heat transfer\nless effective (higher Sg,HT) and, even for increasing particle diameters,\nthe viscous dissipation becomes more important. Also, the Sg,FAC and\nSg,SAC contributions were found to be significant at lower mass flow\n\n\n\n7.2 Optimization of Passive Oscillating-Flow Regenerators 299\n\nrates, i.e., lower superficial velocities and shorter matrices.\n\nTable 7.9 \u2013 Minimum Sg parameters for the FA PEC for ? = 95%, at\na fixed frequency of 1 Hz and variable flow rates between 100 and 300\nkg/h.\n\nm? ?

As the frequency in-\ncreases, the utilization factor decreases due to the shorter blow period.\nNevertheless, the matrix length also decreases, reducing the thermal\nmass of the solid phase and the total interstitial area. As a result,\nthe utilization factor and NTU do not present significant variations\nwith frequency, which result in a nearly constant contribution (in %) of\nSg,HT to Sg,min. At small frequencies Sg,VD was higher even for bigger\nparticle diameters due to the large value of the matrix length. On the\nother hand, higher frequencies need shorter matrix lengths and smaller\nparticle diameters, which increases the penalty associated with axial\nheat conduction (Sg,FAC and Sg,SAC).\n\n7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Re-\ngenerators\n\nThe results for the optimization of active magnetic regenerators are\ndiscussed in this section. The simulations were carried out considering\npacked bed matrices composed by gadolinium spheres of different sizes.\nEq. (7.8) was applied to calculate the local rate of entropy generation.\nThe properties of pure water were assumed for the fluid phase. For\nsimplicity, the magnetic flux density variation is described by a step\nfunction, with minimum and maximum flux densities of 0 and 1.5 T.\n\n7.3.1 Performance Evaluation Criteria for AMRs\n\nThe PEC used in the AMR optimization were the same used in the\npassive regenerator optimization: the Variable Geometry (VG) and\nthe Fixed Face Area (FA) (WEBB; KIM, 2005). The ranges of the vari-\nables explored in the analysis are presented in Table 7.13 and the flow\nchart of the various scenarios is in Fig. 7.2. The performance con-\nstraint of an AMR optimization is the cycle-average cooling capacity\nat a fixed temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs.\nThis constraint corresponds to a fixed cycle-average heat transfer rate\nat the cold heat exchanger, independently of the matrix size/mass and\noperating conditions. In the present analysis, a cycle-average cooling\n\ncapacity, Q?c, of 20 W per regenerator is considered, for a tempera-\nture span ?THex = 15 K.\n\n\n\n304 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\nTable 7.13 \u2013 Ranges of the geometric variables for each PEC in the\nAMR optimization.\n\nPEC Dh,Reg [mm] ?

In the first scenario, the\nfrequency was kept fixed at 1 Hz and the mass flow rate was varied from\n40 to 100 kg/h (steps of 10 kg/h) for the VG PEC and from 50 to 200\nkg/h (steps of 25 kg/h) for the FA PEC. In the second scenario, the\nfrequency was varied from 1 to 4 Hz (steps of 0.5 Hz) and the mass\nflow rate was kept constant at 60 kg/h for the VG PEC and at 200\nkg/h for the FA PEC.\n\nFor each scenario of the VG PEC, discrete data points were selected in\nthe housing diameter and particle diameter ranges shown in Table 7.13.\nThe incremental steps were 2.5 mm for the range 12.5 ? Dh,Reg ? 30\nmm, 5 mm for 30 ? Dh,Reg ? 50 mm and 0.1 mm for dp, which resulted\nin 216 independent cases for each designed mass flow rate or frequency.\nSimilarly, for the FA PEC, the aspect ratio range was divided in incre-\nmental steps of 0.5, plus the 0.1-mm steps for dp, resulting in 270 cases\nfor the variable frequency and variable mass flow rate scenarios for each\ndesigned mass flow rate or frequency. In total, 6804 different simula-\ntions were performed for the two PEC. As in the passive regenerator\nsimulations, the searches for the points of minimum entropy generation\nwere refined further using 4th-order (or less) polynomial interpolations\n(R2 > 0.9999) to guarantee the stability of the numerical solutions\nand provide a better resolution (finer than 0.5 mm for Dh,Reg, 0.05\nfor ? and 0.01 mm for dp) for the minimum Sg value at a reasonable\ncomputational cost.\n\n7.3.2 Entropy Generation Cycle-Average Cooling\nCapacity Contour Maps\n\nAs the numerical convergence is obtained for a specific set of simulated\nparameters associated with a PEC, the AMR configurations that yield\n\n\n\n7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Regenerators 305\n\nthe desired value of Q?c can be identified. As illustrated previously in\nthe passive regenerators optimization, Fig. 7.12 presents the contour\nmaps for the VG PEC with m? = 60 kg/h and frequencies of 1 and\n4 Hz. Fig. 7.13 shows the contour maps for the FA PEC with m? =\n200 kg/h and frequencies of 1 and 4 Hz. Lines of constant Sg (red\n\nlines) are plotted together with lines of constant Q?c (blue lines), as\na function of the particle diameter and housing diameter for the VG\nPEC (Fig. 7.12) and particle diameter and housing aspect ratio for the\nFA PEC (Fig. 7.13).\n\nFrom Figs. 7.12 and 7.13, it can be seen that the target value of Q?c =\n20 W per regenerator (blue solid line) can be achieved with different\ncombinations of dp and Dh,Reg or ?, with different frequencies and flow\nrates for each PEC. For the VG PEC with m? = 60 kg/h and f = 1 Hz,\n\nFig. 7.12(a), Q?c = 20 W per regenerator can be achieved with values of\ndp between 0.5 and 1.4 mm and housing diameters between 12.5 and 50\nmm, which correspond to values of ? between 0.25 and 16. In this case,\n\nthe minimum value of Sg that guarantees a value of Q?c = 20 W per\nregenerator was found around dp = 1.2 mm and Dh,Reg = 20 mm. For\nthe 4 Hz operating frequency, Fig. 7.12(b), the minimum Sg is shifted\nto larger values of dp, yielding other combination of Dh,Reg and ?.\n\nFor the FA PEC with m? = 200 kg/h and f = 1 Hz, Fig. 7.13(a),\n\nthe minimum Sg for Q?c = 20 W per regenerator was identified in the\nvicinity of dp = 1.1 mm, with an aspect ratio around 4. As expected,\n\nfor other frequencies the minimum Sg range changes and Q?c = 20 W\nper regenerator is achieved with other combinations of dp and ?, as\npresented in Fig. 7.13(b).\n\n\n\n306 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n2\n0\n\n20\n\n0.005\n\n0.005\n\n0\n.0\n\n0\n6\n\n0.006\n\n0.007\n\n0.007\n\n0.007\n\n0.008\n\n0.008\n\n0.008\n\n0.008\n\n0.009\n0.009\n\n0.009\n\n0.009\n\n0.009\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n0.015\n\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nH\no\n\nu\ns\n\nin\ng\n\n D\nia\n\nm\ne\n\nte\nr \n\n[m\nm\n\n]\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n.0\n\n0\n2\n5\n\n0.0025\n\n0.00275\n\n0.00275\n\n0.00275\n\n0\n.0\n\n0\n2\n7\n5\n\n0.0029\n\n0.0029\n\n0.0029\n\n0.0029\n\n0.003\n\n0.003\n\n0.003\n\n0.003\n\n0.00325\n\n0.00325 0.00325\n\n0.00325\n\n0.00325\n\n0.00325\n\n0.0035\n0.0035\n\n0.0035\n\n0.0035\n\n0.004\n\n0.004\n\n0.004\n\n0.004\n\n0.0045\n\n0.0045\n\n0.0045\n\n0.005\n\n0.005\n\n0.005\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nH\no\n\nu\ns\n\nin\ng\n\n D\nia\n\nm\ne\n\nte\nr \n\n[m\nm\n\n]\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.12 \u2013 Lines of constant Q?c (blue lines) and Sg (red lines) as\na function of dp and Dh,Reg for the VG PEC with m? = 60 kg/h and\nfrequencies of (a) 1 Hz; (b) 4 Hz.\n\n\n\n7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Regenerators 307\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n70\n\n70\n\n70\n\n0.030.0\n32\n\n0.032\n\n0.\n03\n\n2\n\n0.\n03\n\n2\n\n0.033\n\n0.033\n\n0.\n03\n\n3\n\n0.0\n33\n\n0.\n03\n\n3\n\n0.034\n\n0.034\n\n0.\n03\n\n4\n\n0\n.0\n\n3\n4\n\n0.0\n34\n\n0.\n03\n\n4\n\n0.035\n\n0.035\n\n0.\n03\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n3\n5\n\n0.03\n5\n\n0.0\n35\n\n0.\n04\n\n0\n.0\n\n4\n\n0\n.0\n\n4\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.0\n4\n\n0\n.0\n\n4\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n4\n5\n\n0.045\n\n0.04\n5\n\n0.\n05\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0\n.0\n\n5\n\n0.\n05\n\n0\n.0\n\n6\n\n0\n.0\n\n6\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n\n0\n.0\n\n7\n\n0\n.0\n\n8\n0\n.0\n\n9\n0\n\n.1\n\n0\n.1\n\n1\n0\n\n.1\n2\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nA\ns\n\np\ne\n\nc\nt \n\nR\na\n\nti\no\n\n [\n-]\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n70\n\n70\n\n7\n0\n\n0.\n00\n\n8\n\n0.\n00\n\n9\n\n0.00\n9\n\n0.0\n09\n\n0.\n01\n\n0.0\n1 0.01\n\n0.0\n1\n\n0.01\n\n0.\n01\n\n1\n\n0.0\n11\n\n0.011\n\n0.011\n\n0.01\n1\n\n0.\n01\n\n2\n\n0.\n01\n\n2\n\n0.01\n2\n\n0.012\n\n0.012\n\n0\n.0\n\n1\n4\n\n0.\n01\n\n4\n\n0.014\n\n0\n.0\n\n1\n6\n\n0\n.0\n\n1\n6\n\n0.016\n\n0\n.0\n\n1\n8\n\n0\n.0\n\n1\n8\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n2\n\n0\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nA\ns\n\np\ne\n\nc\nt \n\nR\na\n\nti\no\n\n [\n-]\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.13 \u2013 Lines of constant Q?c (blue lines) and Sg (red lines) as a\nfunction of dp and ? for the FA PEC with m? = 200 kg/h and frequencies\nof (a) 1 Hz; (b) 4 Hz.\n\n\n\n308 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\n7.3.3 Variable Geometry (VG) Evaluation Criteria\n\n7.3.3.1 Fixed Frequency\n\nThis section describes the results for the VG PEC at a fixed frequency\nand variable mass flow rate.

To achieve a lower T CE a\nhigher ?-NTU matrix is necessary, which is guaranteed by the small-\nest utilization, smaller particle size (compared with 50-70 kg/h) and\na longer matrix with a smaller Dh,Reg, corresponding to higher super-\nficial velocities. This optimum scenario is confirmed by the smallest\nabsolute value of Sg,HT, meaning a high effectiveness heat transfer.\nHowever, the use of a smaller particle size increased slightly the penal-\nties associated with the viscous dissipation.\n\nAs the mass flow rate is increased up to 70 kg/h, the optimal region\n\n\n\n7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Regenerators 311\n\nMass Flow Rate [kg/h]\n\nS\ng\n\n [\nJ\n\n/K\n]\n\n40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\n0\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0.01\n\n0.012\n\n0.014 sg,HT\nsg,min\n\nsg,VD\nsg,FAC\nsg,SAC\n\nMass Flow Rate [kg/h]\nC\n\no\nn\n\ntr\nib\n\nu\nti\n\no\nn\n\ns\n [\n\n%\n]\n\n40 50 60 70 80 90 1000\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nFigure 7.15 \u2013 Individual contributions to the total entropy at the min-\n\nimum, Sg,min, for the VG PEC for Q?c = 20 W per regenerator and\n?THex = 15 K, at a fixed frequency of 1 Hz and flow rates between 40\nand 100 kg/h.\n\nshifts to bigger particle diameters, larger housing diameters and shorter\naspect ratios (see Table 7.14). Although the NTU is low, the small\nabsolute values of utilization still result in a high effectiveness and a\nlarge ?Tc, which when multiplied by the low flow rate guarantees the\n20-W constraint. This trend persists until a minimum NTU is found\nfor m? = 70 kg/h.\n\nFor mass flow rates higher than 70 kg/h, lower values of ?Tc are suf-\nficient to guarantee the 20-W constraint. However, the increase of the\nutilization needs to be compensated with a larger NTU in order to\nachieve the 15 K of span. Hence, the optimal conditions involve small\nparticle diameters, large housing diameters and small values of aspect\nratio. Since at high mass flow rates and small particle diameters the vis-\ncous losses become more important, a big housing diameter is required\nto decrease the superficial velocity, which results in shorter matrices.\n\n\n\n312 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\nNevertheless, smaller particle diameters are necessary to enhance the\ninterstitial heat transfer, increasing NTU and decreasing Sg,HT (in %).\nHowever, as the regenerator effectiveness decreases with the increas-\ning utilization, the absolute value of Sg,HT increases with m?. With\nshorter matrices, the axial conduction contributions (Sg,FAC) become\nmore important (in %) since the spheres size becomes smaller and the\nsuperficial velocity decreases. Sg,VD, also increases with the mass flow\nrate and the decreasing on the particle size. The contribution of Sg,SAC\nis small, around 1%.\n\nRegarding the demagnetization factor, for a constant temperature dif-\nference between the thermal reservoirs, a bigger ND,total means a smaller\neffective magnetic field, Heff, (Eq. (4.47)) and a smaller ?Tad. To com-\npensate the reduction of the MCE, a higher effectiveness regenerator\nis required. However, for the cases evaluated here, the variations in\nND,total were little and, for the relatively small temperature difference\nof 15 K used as a constraint, these effects were of secondary importance\nto the MCE when the different optimum dimensions were compared.\n\nIt has been shown in this section that the optimal configurations for\nf = 1 Hz and several mass flow rates are related to small housing\ndiameters (between 18 and 25 mm). Thus, the magnetic circuit size\ncan be estimated considering a permanent magnet built in a Halbach\ncylinder array, for which the magnetic flux density, B, inside the bore\nof an infinite cylinder is given by (BJ\u00d8RK et al., 2008):\n\nB = Brem ln\n\n(\nDe\nDi\n\n)\n(7.11)\n\nwhere Brem is the remanence of the magnet grade, De is the external\nand Di the internal diameters of the cylinder. Considering B = 1.5\nT, Brem = 1.4 T for a Nd2Fe14B magnet grade (BAKKER-MAGNETICS,\n2014), Di = Dh,Reg and Lmag = LReg = ?Dh,Reg, the optimum regen-\nerator dimensions for each flow rate lead to the ideal Halbach cylinder\ndimensions presented in Table 7.15.\n\nThe results show that the smaller mass flow rates require smaller di-\nameters and longer magnets, while the higher flow rates are related to\nbigger diameters and shorter magnets. However, the total volume of\npermanent magnet necessary to create a flux density of 1.5 T in the\nbore of the Halbach cylinder is about the same for all cases.

Hence,\nlarger housing diameters and shorter matrices are needed to decrease\nthe superficial velocity and reduce the viscous losses, which leads to a\nmore significant axial conduction contribution to Sg,min.\n\nBy increasing the frequency and reducing the utilization, the heat trans-\nfer is enhanced, which decreases the absolute values of Sg,HT, as seen in\n\n\n\n316 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nS\ng\n\n [\nJ\n\n/K\n]\n\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n\n0\n\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n0.003\n\n0.004\n\n0.005\n\n0.006\n\n0.007\n\n0.008\n\nsg,HT\nsg,min\n\nsg,VD\nsg,FAC\nsg,SAC\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nC\no\n\nn\ntr\n\nib\nu\n\nti\no\n\nn\ns\n\n [\n%\n\n]\n\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 40\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n\nFigure 7.17 \u2013 Individual contributions to the total entropy at the min-\n\nimum, Sg,min, for the VG PEC for Q?c = 20 W per regenerator at\n?THex = 15 K, at a fixed mass flow rate of 60 kg/h and frequencies\nbetween 1 and 4 Hz.\n\nFig. 7.17.

As seen in Fig. 7.17, the contributions of\nSg,SAC are almost negligible, while Sg,HT dominates the total Sg,min. In\nconclusion, the operation of an AMR at a higher frequency reduces the\nlevel of irreversibility in the AMR, as Sg,min decreases with frequency.\nThe optimized points at m? = 60 kg/h and f between 1 and 4 Hz are\nassociated with small housing diameters, around 19 mm, and aspect\nratios of approximately 4.5.

Such\na high ?-NTU matrix is required to achieve the cooling capacity target\nby increasing ?Tc, which results in comparatively small value of Sg,HT\n(see Fig. 7.19). However, a shorter matrix is necessary to cut the viscous\ndissipation contribution, but ends up increasing the penalties associated\nwith the axial heat conduction. In this case, the Sg,HT, Sg,VD and\nSg,FAC have around the same weight (in % and absolute values) to the\ntotal Sg.\n\nIncreasing the mass flow rate, the minimum Sg is shifted to bigger par-\nticle diameters and longer matrices. As the mass flow rate is increased,\n?Tc becomes smaller, and less effective matrices are necessary, which\nraises Sg,HT. Therefore, the use of bigger particle sizes compensates\nthe increasing superficial velocities and the effect of longer matrices\non the viscous dissipation contribution, which increases in terms of its\n\n\n\n320 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\nabsolute value but not in relative terms (%). Longer matrices help to\nreduce the impact of the axial conduction. The increase of ND,total is\nalso small for the optimized dimensions.\n\nAs in the passive regenerator optimization for the FA PEC at a fixed\nfrequency, Sg,HT and Sg,VD are the main contributions (in %) to the to-\ntal entropy generation. As the mass flow rate increases, NTU decreases\nand ? increases, making the heat transfer less effective (higher Sg,HT)\nand, even though the particle diameter that minimizes the entropy\ngeneration increases, the viscous dissipation becomes more important.\nAlso, the Sg,FAC and Sg,SAC contributions were found to be significant\nat lower mass flow rates, i.e., lower superficial velocities and shorter\nmatrices.\n\nRegarding the optimum regenerator and magnet dimensions, an ex-\nternal diameter De = 73 mm was encountered for the ideal Halbach\ncylinder. Obviously, the amount of magnet material required to gener-\nate the 1.5 T flux density change increases linearly with the optimized\nregenerator length. In this case, in terms of the total minimum entropy\ngenerated, using the lowest mass flow rate possible means a more ef-\nficient AMR design, which coincides with the smallest ideal magnetic\ncircuit size (short Halbach cylinders).\n\n7.3.4.2 Fixed Mass Flow Rate\n\nThis section presents the results for the FA PEC for a fixed mass flow\nrate of 200 kg/h and variable frequency between 1 and 4 Hz. Again,\n\nthe results are illustrated for a target Q?c = 20 W per regenerator at\n?THex = 15 K. Fig. 7.20 shows the behavior of Sg as a function of\ndp and ?. Table 7.18 summarizes the optimal parameters for each\nfrequency. Fig. 7.21 presents the individual contributions to the total\nentropy at the minimum, Sg,min.\n\nAs in the VG PEC, for a constant mass flow rate, the ?Tc that satisfies\n\nthe performance constraint of Q?c = 20 W per regenerator is also fixed.\nHence, in the FA PEC for a constant mass flow rate, the effectiveness\nchanges only a little to compensate the small variations of ND,total and,\nthus, minor differences in the utilization factor and NTU are observed\nwhen compared with the FA PEC to a constant frequency.\n\nFor f = 4 Hz, the minimum Sg configuration is out of the range of the\nparticle diameter and aspect ratio. The values in Table 7.18 refer to\n\n\n\n7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Regenerators 321\n\nTable 7.18 \u2013 Minimum Sg parameters for the FA PEC for Q?c = 20 W\nper regenerator at ?THex = 15 K, at a fixed mass flow rate of 200 kg/h\nand variable frequency between 1 and 4 Hz.\n\nf dp Dh,Reg ?

Thus, this case\nwas not included in the analysis.\n\nSince ? is approximately constant, this AMR optimization scenario is\nquite similar to the passive regenerator optimization. For f = 1 Hz,\nthe minimum Sg was found for a big particle diameter and a large as-\npect ratio, while for f = 3.5 Hz, the minimum Sg was characterized\nby a small particle size and a short matrix length. As the frequency\nis increased, the utilization factor decreases due to the shorter blow\nperiod. Nevertheless, the matrix length also decreases, reducing the\nthermal mass of the solid phase and the total interstitial area. Conse-\nquently, the utilization factor and the NTU did not present significant\nvariations with frequency, resulting in a nearly constant contribution\n(in %) of Sg,HT to Sg,min, as can be seen in Fig. 7.21. At low frequen-\ncies Sg,VD was large even for bigger particle diameters due to the large\nvalue of the matrix length. On the other hand, higher frequencies can\nsustain shorter matrix lengths and smaller particle diameters, but this\nincreases (in %) the penalty associated with axial heat conduction in\nthe fluid, Sg,FAC. Sg,SAC presented a minor contribution to Sg,min.\n\nIn the present scenario, the total minimum entropy generation was\nobserved at the higher operating frequencies. As in the FA PEC for\na fixed frequency and variable mass flow rate, the more efficient AMR\ndesign dimensions, found at the higher frequencies, require the smallest\nideal magnetic circuit size due to their shorter aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n322 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\nParticle Diameter [mm]\n\nS\ng\n\n [\nJ\n\n/K\n]\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n1.5 Hz\n\n1.0 Hz\n\n2.0 Hz\n\n2.5 Hz\n3.0 Hz\n3.5 Hz\n4.0 Hz\n\n(a)\n\nAspect Ratio [-]\n\nS\ng\n\n [\nJ\n\n/K\n]\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n1.5 Hz\n\n1.0 Hz\n\n2.0 Hz\n\n2.5 Hz\n3.0 Hz\n3.5 Hz\n4.0 Hz\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.20 \u2013 Minimum entropy analysis for the FA PEC for Q?c = 20\nW per regenerator at ?THex = 15 K, fixed mass flow rate of 200 kg/h\nand variable frequencies in the range of 1-4 Hz: (a) Sg as a function of\ndp; (b) Sg as a function of ?.\n\n\n\n7.3 Optimization of Active Magnetic Regenerators 323\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nS\ng\n\n [\nJ\n\n/K\n]\n\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.025\n\n0.03\n\n0.035\n\nsg,HT\nsg,min\n\nsg,VD\nsg,FAC\nsg,SAC\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nC\no\n\nn\ntr\n\nib\nu\n\nti\no\n\nn\ns\n\n [\n%\n\n]\n\n1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 40\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFigure 7.21 \u2013 Individual contributions to the total entropy at the min-\n\nimum, Sg,min, for the FA PEC for Q?c = 20 W per regenerator at\n?THex = 15 K, at a fixed mass flow rate of 200 kg/h and variable\nfrequency between 1 and 4 Hz.\n\n\n\n324 7 Optimization of Thermal Regenerators\n\n\n\n325\n\n8 Final Considerations\n\nThe work presented in this thesis dealt with the experimental and nu-\nmerical evaluation of the fluid flow, heat transfer and thermo-magnetic\nphenomena in thermal regenerators for magnetic cooling applications\naround room temperature. As proposed initially, an experimental ap-\nparatus was designed and built, as well an 1D transient numerical model\nwas developed to accomplish the objectives of this work. Also, different\nporous media matrices were used as thermal regenerators. Information\nregarding the heat transfer effectiveness, viscous, thermal and magnetic\nlosses, and performance as a cooling system were evaluated by means\nof the experimental and numerical approaches.\n\nThe passive regenerator study was fundamental to understand the heat\ntransfer and viscous losses in regenerative matrices using a liquid as a\nheat transfer agent. Firstly, the experience gained along the experimen-\ntal testing of the passive regenerators related to the instrumentation\nand regression of the experimental data was crucial for the develop-\nment of a robust experimental procedure to evaluate the performance\nof passive and magnetic regenerators.\n\nBy using different sizes of spheres and different regenerator casing di-\nmensions it was possible to verify the sensitivity of the experimental\nand numerical results when operating parameters were changed, e.g.,\noperating frequency and utilization factor. The results for packed beds\nof spheres corroborated the expectation that small particle diameter\nspheres guarantee the highest thermal effectivenesses, at the expense\nof higher viscous losses. In terms of the casing dimensions, matrices\nwith bigger aspect ratios have a high effectiveness as found for Casings\n#3 and #4. However, for Casing #4 (smaller cross sectional area and\nhigher superficial velocities), the penalties associated with the viscous\nlosses were more pronounced. On the other hand, for a fixed cross sec-\ntional area (Casings #1, #2 and #3), higher effectivenesses were found\n\n\n\n326 8 Final Considerations\n\nfor the regenerators with larger thermal mass. Nevertheless, the results\nshowed that the improvement of the effectiveness by increasing the re-\ngenerator aspect ratio was little when compared with the increasing of\nthe viscous losses.\n\nComparing different matrix geometries, the results showed that, in\nterms of the thermal effectiveness, the geometries behaved were very\nsimilarly, with the pin arrays presenting a better performance at low\nutilization and the packed beds performing better at high utilizations.\nThe parallel plate geometry presented a more limited performance be-\ncause of the axial heat conduction and approximately constant inter-\nstitial heat transfer coefficient.\n\nIn addition, the results showed that a good regenerator design also\nhas to take into account an optimum balance between the void volume\nsize and the inlet flow distribution in the regenerative matrix. As a\nrecommendation, the void volume has to be as smaller as possible,\nwithout restricting the fluid flow at the entrance region. This way,\nsquare and round regenerator cross sectional areas are less susceptible\nto maldistribution effects on the fluid flow.\n\nThe numerical model, including the void volume modeling, was success-\nfully implemented and was capable of reproducing the experimental re-\nsults for all the operating conditions. The model was able to reproduce\nwith good precision the variation on the inlet fluid stream temperature\ndue to the void volumes, and captured the axial heat conduction in\nsituations where the diffusion heat transfer is on the same order as the\nadvection heat transfer.\n\nWith respect to the thermodynamic performance of active regenera-\ntors, the results for Spheres #3 exposed one of the main limitations of\nstate of the art in AMR research, namely the inability to achieve high\ncooling capacities together with large temperature spans between the\nreservoirs. For regenerators composed by Gd spheres, the second-law\nefficiency was maximum for 15 and 20-K temperature spans.\n\nComparing different matrix geometries, the results showed a similar\nperformance for the pin arrays and spheres packed beds in terms of\nthe cooling capacity and coefficient of performance. While the spheres\nbed had a higher cooling capacity due to a higher thermal effectiveness,\nespecially at high utilizations, the pins had a higher COP because of\nthe lower viscous losses. Again, the parallel plate geometry presented\nseveral limitations due to the approximately interstitial constant heat\n\n\n\n8.1 Recommendations to Future Works 327\n\ntransfer coefficient and possibly due to a higher heat gain through the\nregenerator casing. In this scenario, if manufacturing limitations are\nconsidered, the spheres packed beds are certainly the most promising\ngeometry for applications in AMR coolers.\n\nThe AMR numerical model, including the different external losses, i.e.,\ncasing heat gain, magnetic field axial profile and void volume, was capa-\nble of reproducing the experimental data with good precision. There-\nfore, the satisfactory performance of the methodology in simulating\npassive and active regenerators, demonstrated that the 1D approach\ncan be used as a tool to design optimum regenerators.\n\nThis way, a robust methodology combining the Entropy Generation\nMinimization and the Performance Evaluation Criteria (PEC) was pro-\nposed. The variable geometry (VG) and fixed face area (FA) PEC were\nimplemented aiming at optimizing passive regenerators for a target ef-\nfectiveness of 95%, and AMRs for a target condition of 20-W cooling\ncapacity at 15-K temperature span. The results presented optimum\ncombinations of casing diameter, aspect ratio and sphere diameter, for\nspecified values of mass flow rate and operating frequency.\n\nThe study indicated possible directions for the AMR performance, such\nas: (i) the optimization of the casing dimensions and matrix geometry\nto reduce the penalties associated with heat transfer and viscous dis-\nsipation; (ii) the optimization of the regenerator cross sectional area\nwith respect to the reduction of the regenerative mass at the expense\nof a better thermal insulation.\n\n8.1 Recommendations to Future Works\n\nBased on the advances presented in this thesis some important recom-\nmendations for future works can be listed as follows:\n\n1. Replace the double effect pump by a rotary valve system and\nperform experimental tests using the same operating conditions\nas presented for the Spheres #3 regenerator. This will allow\ncomparisons between the different pumping systems in terms of\nthe AMR performance;\n\n2. Use different rotary valve gaskets to evaluate experimentally the\nsynchronization of the magnetic and fluid flow profiles in order to\n\n\n\n328 8 Final Considerations\n\nfind the best operating condition of the AMR;\n\n3. Validate the numerical model in terms of the synchronization of\nthe magnetic and fluid flow profiles and perform the optimization\nof the fluid flow periods;\n\n4. Expand the magnetocaloric materials properties library and im-\nplement a multi-layer regenerator routine in the numerical model\nto evaluate the performance improvement reported in the litera-\nture;\n\n5. Perform experimental tests with different magnetocaloric materi-\nals, assembling the new materials in a multi-layer configuration;\n\n6. Validate the numerical model with respect to the multi-layer ex-\nperimental tests;\n\n7. Use the optimization expertise to optimize the multi-layer con-\nfiguration in terms of the Curie Temperature and the length of\neach layer;\n\n8. Include in the EGM model the entropy generated by the heat\ntransfer through the regenerator casing. This modified model,\nassociated with the PECs, will allow the optimization between the\nreduction of the regenerator cross sectional area at the expense\nof improving the thermal insulation;\n\n9. Evaluate the applicability of lumped models to describe the heat\ntransfer in the casing region, given that such models are less com-\nputationally demanding.\n\n\n\n329\n\nReferences\n\nACKERMANN, R.

(2015).\n\nA.1 Modeling\n\nA.1.1 Analytical Modeling\n\nA.1.1.1 Basic Equations\n\nIn the analytical model of the NHC configuration, the magnetic flux\ndensity generated at the core of each cylinder is evaluated indepen-\ndently. The fundamental expression to quantify the magnetic flux den-\nsity at the center of a finite length non-segmented Halbach cylinder,\nBfin, is given by (BJ\u00d8RK et al., 2010d; COEY, 2002):\n\n\n\n348 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design\n\nBfin = Brem\n\n[\nln\n\n(\nDe\nDi\n\n)\n+ (A.1)\n\n(L/2)\n\n2\n\n(\n1?\n\n(L/2)2 + (Di/2)2\n?\n\n1?\n(L/2)2 + (De/2)2\n\n)\n\n? ln\n\n(\n(L/2) +\n\n?\n(L/2)2 + (De/2)2\n\n(L/2) +\n?\n\n(L/2)2 + (Di/2)2\n\n)]\n\nwhere Brem is the magnitude of the remanent flux density of the per-\nmanent magnet, L is the length of the Halbach cylinder, and De and\nDi are the external and internal diameters of the cylinder, respec-\ntively. In Eq. (A.1), it follows that if L ? ?, then Bfin ? Binf =\nBrem ln(De/Di), where Binf is the magnetic flux density at the center\nof an infinite non-segmented Halbach cylinder.\n\nDue to fabrication restrictions, the magnet cylinder has to be divided\ninto n segments with specific remanent flux density orientations (see\nFig. 3.6 for an example of an 8-segment NHC). The magnetic flux\ndensity at the center of a finite length Halbach cylinder with n segments\nis given by (COEY, 2002; BJ\u00d8RK et al., 2008):\n\nBHC = Bfin\n\n[\nsin(2?/n)\n\n(2?/n)\n\n]\n(A.2)\n\nwhere n is the number of segments. Naturally, if n ? ? and the\nremanent flux density changes continuously for each segment, then\nBHC ? Bfin (BJ\u00d8RK et al., 2008). Therefore, in the design procedure,\nthe analytical expression given by Eq. (A.2) is used to calculate the\nmagnetic flux densities at the center of the external (BHC,E) and inter-\nnal (BHC,I) cylinders.\n\nA.1.1.2 Parameters and Constraints\n\nThe magnetic circuit is designed in accordance with the regenerator\ndimensions. Parameters such as the regenerator diameter, length and\nmass have a direct effect on the magnetic field intensities and field\nvolume. The following input parameters are required in the proposed\n\n\n\nA.1 Modeling 349\n\ndesign procedure:\n\n? The inner diameter of the internal magnet, Di,I, which is directly\nrelated to the regenerator housing diameter;\n\n? The air gap between the magnet arrays, `gap. This parameter\ndetermines the inner diameter of the external magnet, Di,E. The\nsmaller the air gap the higher the magnetic field intensity at the\nNHC core. However, as pointed out by Arnold et al. (2014), small\nair gaps intensify the interaction between the fringing fields of\nthe internal and external magnets, increasing the torque needed\nto rotate the system;\n\n? Number of Halbach segments, n. Tura and Rowe (2011) com-\npared a 16-segment NHC with an 8-segment NHC and observed\na reduction of about 7% in the maximum magnetic flux density.\nManufacturing costs have to be considered in the selection of this\nparameter;\n\n? Magnet grade. This determines the remanent flux density, Brem,\nand intrinsic coercivity, Hcj, of each magnet. While Brem is di-\nrectly proportional to the resultant magnetic flux density, Eq.\n(A.2), Hcj controls the operating stability of the NHC. As will be\nseen, the internal Halbach cylinder must be manufactured with a\nhigh coercivity magnet grade (small Brem), to avoid magnetiza-\ntion reversal.\n\nTo determine the outer diameter of the inner magnet, De,I, Bj\u00f8rk (2011)\nderived an ideal ratio between the outer and inner diameters of an\ninfinite non-segmented Halbach cylinder, De,I/Di,I, of 2.219. In the\npresent analysis, the range of values to find De,I was set around this\noptimum as follows:\n\n2.15 ?\nDe,I\nDi,I\n\n? 2.25 (A.3)\n\nThe inner diameter of the external magnet, Di,E, is calculated by simply\nadding the air gap, `gap:\n\nDi,E = De,I + 2`gap (A.4)\n\n\n\n350 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design\n\nTo determine the outer diameter of the external magnet, De,E, Bj\u00f8rk\net al. (2010a) proposed the following design relationship for NHCs:\n\n0.8 ?\nDe,I/Di,I\nDe,E/Di,E\n\n? 1 (A.5)\n\nAt this point, in the present method, the diameters of the internal and\nexternal magnets are known, but the lengths of the magnet cylinders\nare not. In the interest of weight, cost and manufacturability, Tura and\nRowe (2011) suggest that the ratio of the external diameter and the\nlength of the external cylinder, De,E/LE should be close to unity. This\nleads to the following design constraint:\n\n0.8 ?\nDe,E\nLE\n\n? 1.2 (A.6)\n\nIn order to minimize the stray field gradient out of the magnet and, at\nthe same time, maintain a high average magnetic flux density at the\nmaximum position (see Fig. 3.7), the following constraint has been used\nto determine the length of the internal magnet (BJ\u00d8RK et al., 2010a):\n\n0.8 ?\nLI\nLE\n? 1 (A.7)\n\nA.1.1.3 Design Procedure\n\nIn the NHC design procedure, the parameter ranges given by Eqs. (A.3),\n(A.5), (A.6) and (A.7) are divided into 21 increments each, resulting in\n214 = 194,481 possible magnet configurations. For a set of input pa-\nrameters, namely, Di,I, `gap, n and magnet grade, Eq. (A.2) is applied\nto calculate the magnetic flux densities at the centers of the external\nand internal cylinders, BHC,E and BHC,I, for each possible magnet con-\nfiguration. Then, the maximum and minimum magnetic flux densities\nfor the nested configuration, Bmax and Bmin, are simply calculated by:\n\nBmax = BHC,E + BHC,I (A.8)\n\nBmin = |BHC,E ?BHC,I| (A.9)\n\n\n\nA.1 Modeling 351\n\nBj\u00f8rk et al. (2010b) proposed the following figure of merit to charac-\nterize permanent magnet designs for magnetic refrigeration,\n\n?cool =\n(\n?Bhigh?2/3 ??Blow?2/3\n\n) ?Field\n?Magnet\n\n?? (A.10)\n\nwhere ?Bhigh? is the volumetric average high magnetic flux density,\n?Blow? is the volumetric average low magnetic flux density, ?Field is the\ntotal volume where the magnetic field is applied, ?Magnet is the volume\nof permanent magnet raw material, for instance, Nd2Fe14B, and ?\n\n? is\nthe fraction of the cycle period during which the magnet is used. ?cool\nquantifies the potential of a magnetic circuit for magnetic refrigeration\napplications. An ideal magnet for an AMR prototype should guarantee\na high magnetic field variation (higher magnetocaloric effect), a large\nvolume of generated magnetic field (larger density of magnetocaloric\nmaterial), must be used during most of the cycle time (ideally in a con-\ntinuous cycle) and, equally important, use a small amount of permanent\nmagnet (to reduce cost).\n\nThe ?cool figure of merit, Eq. (A.10), is calculated for each NHC config-\nuration and used as the main parameter to determine the optimal NHC\ndimensions, i.e., those which result in the highest magnetic flux density\nvariation for the lowest possible amount of raw magnet material. How-\never, the analytical model gives the magnetic flux density at a single\npoint (the center of the magnets), which is assumed to be close to the\nvolume average. The magnetic field volume, ?Field, is calculated con-\nsidering the internal magnet diameter and the regenerator maximum\nlength, since this is the useful volume of magnetic field. The fraction\nof the cycle period, ??, was assumed equal to 0.5, which is typical of\nNHC arrays (BJ\u00d8RK et al., 2010c).\n\nAdditional constraints were adopted to rule out poor performance con-\nfigurations and select the candidates with more desirable characteris-\ntics. These are as follows:\n\n1. \u00b50Hmin &lt;0.1 T, or as close as possible to 0 T (BJ\u00d8RK et al.,\n2010d);\n\n2. ?cool ? 0.025, since ?cool ? 0.03 was reported by Bj\u00f8rk et al.\n(2010c) for typical NHC configurations.\n\n\n\n352 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design\n\nA.1.2 COMSOL Multiphysics Modeling\n\nThe optimal NHC configuration designed according to the analyti-\ncal procedure was numerically simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics\n(v. 4.2, AC/DC Module, Magnetic Fields, No Currents formulation).\nThe magnetostatic formulation, where the electric currents are neg-\nligible, is modeled using the magnetic scalar potential (Vm) defined\n\nas ~H = ??Vm. Substituting the constitutive relation for permanent\nmagnets ( ~B = \u00b50\u00b5r ~H + ~Brem) into the Gauss\u2019s law for magnetism\n\n(?\u00b7 ~B = 0), and by employing the magnetic scalar potential, the model\nbecomes ??\u00b7 (\u00b50\u00b5r?Vm ? ~Brem) = 0 (COMSOL. . . , 2011).\n\n3-D simulations were performed to compute the magnetic flux density\nprofile along the axial z-direction, including the center of the magnet.\nAs will be discussed later, the analytical model corrects ~B at the center\nof the magnet for finite length effects according to Eq. (A.1), but does\nnot calculate the axial magnetic flux density profile and how this profile\nis influenced by end effects, which are crucial to the determination of\nthe final length of the internal array. The 3-D simulations were carried\nout using a mesh of about 1.63 million tetrahedral elements with an\naverage element quality of 0.835. A conjugated gradient solver was\nemployed with a convergence tolerance of 10?6.\n\n2-D simulations were carried out to evaluate the magnetization rever-\nsal in the external and internal arrays and the energy product, BH, of\nthe permanent magnets. The 2D simulations used a mesh with 87443\nquadrilateral elements with an average element quality of 0.985. The\ninput parameters in the 2-D and 3-D simulations were the magnet re-\nmanent flux density and the magnet relative permeability, \u00b5r, which\nwas set to 1.05.\n\nA.2 Experimental Analysis\n\nThe optimal NHC array was manufactured (Bakker Magnetics B.V.)\nand experimental measurements were performed to validate the design\nprocedure and characterize the main parameters of the magnetic cir-\ncuit. Magnetic flux density measurements were carried out using a\nLakeShore 425 model gaussmeter coupled to a transverse probe (model\nHMMT-6J04-VF). Using a purpose-built 3-D Cartesian probe travers-\ning system, the probe was positioned at the center line of the magnet,\n\n\n\nA.3 Results and Discussions 353\n\nx = y = 0 (see Fig. A.1), and traversed from one end of the mag-\nnet structure to the other along the center line. At each z-position,\nthe NHC was rotated at a frequency of 0.25 Hz and the instantaneous\nmagnetic flux density was acquired at a sampling rate of 60 Hz. The\nexperimental uncertainty of the magnetic flux density was evaluated\nat 1% of the measured value. As illustrated in Fig. A.1, both the x\nand y-components of the magnetic flux density vector were measured,\nwhich enabled the evaluation of both the magnitude and direction of\n~B.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure A.1 \u2013 Illustration of the probe position to measure magnetic\nflux density components: (a) Measurement of the Bx component. (b)\nMeasurement of the By component.\n\nTorque measurements were carried out using a torque transducer (HBM\nmodel T22) with a full-scale reading of 20 N m. Time dependent torque\nmeasurements were performed at variable magnet operating frequen-\ncies, f, between 0.25 Hz and 1.5 Hz. The sampling rate was changed\nfrom 75 Hz (at f = 0.25 Hz) to 450 Hz (at f = 1.5 Hz) so as to measure\n300 experimental data points per cycle. The experimental uncertainty\nof the torque was estimated at 0.6% of the measured value.\n\nA.3 Results and Discussions\n\nA.3.1 Design Procedure Results\n\nA basic prerequisite of the NHC array is that a high magnetic field\nintensity must be generated along the entire regenerator length. In\nthe present AMR test device, the maximum regenerator length was\nset at 100 mm. Therefore, the NHC array must be longer than the\n\n\n\n354 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design\n\nregenerator to minimize the influence of magnet end effects on the\nregenerator performance. The other design input parameters are as\nfollows:\n\n? Di,I = 27.0 mm, which is enough to accommodate a 25.4-mm\nOD G10 fiberglass tube used as the regenerator housing;\n\n? `gap = 3.0 mm, following the recommendations of Arnold et al.\n(2014);\n\n? n = 8 magnet segments to balance cost and performance.\n\nThe Nd2Fe14B sintered magnet grade properties selected for the\ninternal and external magnets are presented in Table A.1\n(BAKKER-MAGNETICS, 2014). The choice of two different magnet grades\nfor the inner and outer magnets was based on experience gained through\nnumerical analysis using COMSOL. Although grades with a higher re-\nmanence (which are associated with lower coercivities) resulted higher\nmagnetic flux densities, they were more prone to magnetization rever-\nsal. After trying a few grade combinations, it was verified that the one\npresented in Table 1 did not reverse the magnetization and imposed a\nsmall penalty on the magnetic flux density at the maximum position.\n\nTable A.1 \u2013 Nd2Fe14B sintered magnet grade properties (BAKKER-\nMAGNETICS, 2014).\n\nCylinder Magnet grade Brem\n1[T] Hcj\n\n2[kA/m]\n\nExternal N50M 1.41 1114\nInternal N42UH 1.30 1989\n\n1\nThe minimum value of the remanent flux density presented\n\nin BAKKER-Magnetics (2014) was used.\n2\n\nThe value of Hcj at 293 K was chosen since the application\n\nis at near room temperature conditions.\n\nApplication of the design procedure with the above parameters and\nconditions resulted in a number of possible dimensions for the NHC\narray that satisfied the minimum magnetic flux density and the ?cool\nconstraints. The selected configuration also satisfied compactness cri-\nteria of maximum dimensions for De,E and LE of 140.0 mm and 130.0\nmm, respectively.

This indicates that the analytical method can be used to\ndesign NHC arrays.\n\nFig. A.2 illustrates the magnetic flux density in the x-y plane at the\ncenter of the magnet array (z = 0). Both the maximum, Fig. A.2(a),\nand the minimum, Fig. A.2(b), magnetic flux densities are homoge-\nneously distributed in the magnet core. This is an important result\nfrom the point of view of the validity of the analytical model, which is\nconcerned only with the flux density at the center point of the magnet\n\n\n\n356 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design\n\narray.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure A.2 \u2013 Magnetic flux density distribution in the x-y plane at the\ncenter of the magnet array (z = 0): (a) Maximum flux density magnet\nposition; (b) Minimum flux density magnet position.\n\n\n\nA.3 Results and Discussions 357\n\nThe analytical design procedure indicates that any value of internal\nmagnet length in the range 100 ? LI ? 130 mm satisfies the constraints\nimposed on ?cool and does not generate significant deviations in the\nmaximum and minimum magnetic flux densities, as shown in Table\nA.5. To demonstrate that LI = 115 mm is a suitable length, 3-D\nCOMSOL simulations were performed and the magnetic flux density\nalong the axial direction was evaluated for three different values of LI.\nThe results are presented in Fig. A.3 and in Table A.5. It should be\nnoted that in Fig. A.3 the magnetic flux density is plotted along the\nlength of the regenerator only, i.e., 100 mm. The following remarks can\nbe made regarding the internal magnet length selection:\n\n1. LI = 100 mm. The internal magnet and the regenerator have\nthe same length. As seen in Fig. A.3, as the edge of the magnet\nis approached, a significant reduction of Bmax is observed. This\nreduces the z-averaged maximum magnetic field applied on the\nregenerator in comparison with the other magnet lengths;\n\n2. LI = 130 mm. This length gives the smallest reduction of Bmax\nclose to the ends of the regenerator and, consequently, the highest\naverage magnetic field. However, it represents an increase of 30%\nin the internal magnet volume, which increases the cost of the\nsystem and slightly reduces ?cool;\n\n3. LI = 115 mm. This length constitutes a good compromise in\nterms of cost and performance. While end effects do not reduce\nsignificantly the local and z-averaged values of Bmax when com-\npared to LI = 130 mm, this length actually represents a better\nuse of Nd2Fe14B because of the smaller amount of material and\nhigher ?cool.\n\nA.3.2 Magnetization Reversal and Energy Product\n(BH ) Analysis\n\nHalbach cylinders can generate in their core fairly high magnetic flux\ndensities, ~B, of the order of 2.0 T. Nevertheless, ~B is mainly limited by\nthe intrinsic coercivity of the magnet grade, Hcj. Physically, once the\n\nreverse component of the magnetic field, ~H, reaches a value higher than\nHcj, a localized reversal of the direction of the magnetization is created,\ngiving rise to an additional opposite internal field in the magnet.

Thus, if the criterion imposed by Eq. (A.11) is\nlocally violated, then a localized reversal of the direction of the mag-\nnetization is possible.

This constitutes\na considerable volume of Nd2Fe14B whose potential energy is not used\neffectively. A more specific evaluation of the behavior of the BH prod-\nuct of the internal magnet can be made based on Fig. A.6, which allows\nthe following remarks:\n\n? For the segments in position S1 in Fig. A.6, the resulting mag-\nnetic field ~H (represented by gray arrows) has the same direction\nof the remanent flux density (represented by the purple arrows).\nThis results in a magnetization of the permanent magnet in seg-\nments S1 due to the high magnetic field generated by the external\nmagnet array in the same direction of the remanent flux density\nof the internal segment;\n\n? For the segments in position S2, the resulting magnetic field\n~H (gray arrows) has an opposite direction in relation to the re-\nmanent flux density (purple arrows). This results in a reversal\nmagnetic field in segments S2 (see Eq. (A.11)) which can lead to\na magnetization reversal if the intrinsic coercivity is not properly\nselected.\n\nIt can be concluded that in the present NHC design, replacement of the\nraw magnet material by soft magnetic material in the low energy region\nof the internal magnet is not an option since the flux density generated\nby the internal array is continuously added to and subtracted from\nthe flux density generated by the external array so as to achieve the\n\n\n\nA.3 Results and Discussions 363\n\nhigh and low magnetic flux densities in the core. Thus, the internal\nmagnet must operate at a low energy to allow the desired magnetic\nfield variation in a fixed volume region. This explains why ?cool is\ncomparatively low in this type of magnet system. Additionally, the\nresults for the magnetization reversal and the energy product (BH)\nreinforce the idea that the magnet grade has to be carefully selected\nfor the NHC configuration.\n\nA.3.3 Nested Halbach Cylinder Final Design\n\nA photograph of the final NHC design built according to the dimensions\npresented in Tab. A.2 is presented in Fig. A.7. As mentioned before,\ndespite the more complex bearing structure and motion system, the\ncounter rotating configuration was preferred. Moreover, this design\nrequires the motor to operate at lower angular velocities and higher\ntorques. Also, since one of the objectives of the AMR test apparatus\nis to evaluate experimentally regenerative geometries, such as parallel\nplates and staggered arrays of pins, a fixed direction of the magnetic\nflux density vector guarantees structural stability of the regenerator\ngeometry. Fig. A.8 presents a y ? z cutaway view of the final magnet\ndesign, showing the bearing structure designed for the counter rotation\nof the magnets.\n\nFig. A.9 shows the NHC motion system. A stepper motor (Kalatec\nNema 34, model KML-HT34-487) coupled to a 15:1 reduction gearbox\nis employed to achieve high torques. The stepper motor is controlled\nby a driver (Applied Motion model ST10), which guarantees a precise\noperating speed and frequency control. The torque transducer (HBM\nmodel T22) is assembled between the reduction and spiral bevel gear-\nboxes. The spiral bevel gearbox (Tandler STD00-EA-III, 1:1) was found\nto be a suitable and compact solution to counter rotate the magnets;\nthe torque imposed by the stepper motor is transmitted by the bevel\ngears to two independent shafts that rotate in opposite directions. Two\nsets of pulleys and belts are used to connect the spiral bevel gearbox\nand the magnets.\n\n\n\n364 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure A.6 \u2013 Energy product analysis of the internal magnet: (a) Max-\nimum magnetic field position; (b) Minimum magnetic field position.\nThe black arrows indicate the remanent flux density of each segment.\n\n\n\nA.3 Results and Discussions 365\n\nFigure A.7 \u2013 Nested Halbach Cylinder magnetic circuit built according\nto the dimensions obtained from the proposed design procedure.\n\n?

Figs. A.10(a) and (b) show\nthe results for the y- and x-components, respectively. The resultant of\nthe magnetic flux density vector and its direction (i.e., the angle ? of\nthe resultant with the vertical y axis) are shown in Figs. A.10(c) and\n(d), respectively. The solid lines represent the measurement stations\ninside the NHC array where the regenerator is located (?50 ? z ? 50\nmm). The dotted lines correspond to stations outside the regenerator\nregion surrounded by the bearing structure (see Fig. A.8). Ideally, the\nx-component should be equal to zero, and the resultant should be equal\nto the y-component (? = 0).\n\n\n\nA.3 Results and Discussions 367\n\nRotating angle

On the other hand, outside the NHC array (z ?\n137.5 mm), the x-component increases and the y-component decreases,\nreducing the absolute magnetic flux density to around zero. This causes\n? to increase, showing a residual magnetic flux density outside the\nmagnets.\n\nFig. A.11 shows the axial profiles of the maximum magnetic flux density\ncomponents (x and y), the resultant and the vector direction (?). The\ndark gray region represents the external and internal cylinder arrays,\nand the light gray region the stainless steel support structure. In the\nregenerator region (?50 ? z ? 50 mm), the magnetic flux density is\nhigher than 1.3 T and ? is approximately 2.5?. As expected, ? does not\nvary with the rotating angle.

When the angular frequency is increased, the\namplitude of the oscillation decreases due to the inertia of the magnets.\nOn the other hand, as seen in Fig. A.13(b), the average cycle torque\nincreases linearly with the operating frequency.\n\n\n\nA.3 Results and Discussions 371\n\nRotating Angle [deg]\n\nM\na\n\ng\nn\n\ne\nti\n\nc\n F\n\nlu\nx\n\n D\ne\n\nn\ns\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nT\n\n]\n\n0 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 360\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\n1.25\n\n1.5\n\n1.75\n\n z=0 mm:    (C)  (E)\nz=10 mm:   (C)  (E)\nz=20 mm:  (C)  (E) \nz=30 mm:   (C)  (E)\nz=40 mm:   (C)  (E)\nz=50 mm:  (C)  (E)\n\n(a)\n\nz-axis [mm]\n\nM\na\n\ng\nn\n\ne\nti\n\nc\n F\n\nlu\nx\n\n D\ne\n\nn\ns\n\nit\ny\n\n [\nT\n\n]\n\n-50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n Experimental\n COMSOL\n\n(b)\n\nFigure A.12 \u2013 Comparison between the 3-D COMSOL simulation re-\nsults and the experimental data for the magnetic flux density: (a) As\na function of the rotating angle for different axial positions; (b) Axial\nvariation of the maximum magnetic flux density.\n\n\n\n372 Appendix A Nested Halbach Cylinder Design\n\nRotating angle [deg]\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n [\n\nN\nm\n\n]\n\n0 45 90 135 180 225 270 315 360\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n0.25 Hz \n0.5 Hz \n1 Hz \n1.5 Hz \n\n(a)\n\nOperating frequency [Hz]\n\nA\nv\n\ne\nra\n\ng\ne\n\n C\ny\n\nc\nle\n\n T\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n [\n\nN\nm\n\n]\n\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n(b)\n\nFigure A.13 \u2013 Torque measurements: (a) Torque as a function of the\nrotating angle at different frequencies; (b) Average cycle torque as a\nfunction of the operating frequency.\n\n\n\n373\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nAssembly of the Regenerative\n\nMatrices\n\nB.1 Assembly of Packed Bed Matrices\n\nThe steps of the assembly of the packed bed matrices, presented in\nFig. B.1, were performed as follows:\n\n1. A specified amount of spheres is weighted and the initial mass is\nrecorded;\n\n2. A R-T adapter is mounted at the bottom of the regenerator\nhousing and the casing is held in place by a benchtop vise;\n\n3. A stainless steel end screen, mesh 80, is inserted in the regen-\nerator, on top of the R-T adapter. The screen holds the spheres\ninside the housing and is carefully assembled so as to remain per-\npendicular to the center line of the casing. Otherwise, a different\nbed length or volume is calculated, resulting in a wrong estimate\nof the porosity;\n\n4. From the initial amount of weighted spheres, small samples are\ncollected and carefully spilled into the regenerator housing;\n\n5. Using a pestle, the spheres are compacted in the housing;\n\n6. Steps (4) and (5) are repeated until the housing is filled up with\nspheres;\n\n\n\n374 Appendix B Assembly of the Regenerative Matrices\n\n1\n\n5\n6\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n7\n8\n\nFigure B.1 \u2013 Steps of the assembly of the packed bed matrix.\n\n\n\nB.2 Assembly of Parallel-Plate and Pin Array Matrices 375\n\n7. When the packed spheres reach a thermocouple feed-through,\na temperature probe is inserted and positioned at the center of\nthe housing. The uncertainty related with the temperature probe\naxial position was evaluated at 2 mm;\n\n8. When the regenerator is completely filled, another stainless steel\nend-screen is placed at the top end. Next, the temperature probes\nTCE and THE are assembled and carefully positioned at the ends\nof the matrix. The top R-T adapter is connected, sealing the\nmatrix.\n\n9. Finally, the excess amount of spheres are weighted and the poros-\nity of the matrix is calculated based on the total mass of material\nused and the volume of the matrix.\n\nB.2 Assembly of Parallel-Plate and Pin Ar-\nray Matrices\n\nThe steps of the assembly of the parallel plate and pin array matrices\nare presented in Fig. B.2. This procedure was used in both the stainless\nsteel and Gd matrices. The steps are described next:\n\n1. The five pieces of parallel plates are aligned and 0.13-mm thick\npolymer plates are inserted into the channels to guarantee their\nalignment without obstruction \u2013 see Fig. B.3(a);\n\n2. A similar procedure is carried out for the pin array. However, the\npolymer plates are positioned at 45? to guarantee the alignment\nof the pieces \u2013 see Fig. B.3(b);\n\n3. After the alignment, the pieces are glued (using an epoxy glue)\non a polymer sheet;\n\n4. And a steel weight is carefully placed on top of the assembly to\nguarantee a good contact with the polymer sheet;\n\n5. This procedure is repeated for all the sides of the matrix, until\nthe five pieces are securely combined into a single matrix;\n\n6. The regenerator matrix is inserted into the ABS housing;\n\n\n\n376 Appendix B Assembly of the Regenerative Matrices\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n\nFigure B.2 \u2013 Steps of the assembly of the parallel plate and pin array\nmatrices.\n\n\n\nB.2 Assembly of Parallel-Plate and Pin Array Matrices 377\n\n7. The regenerator is glued (using an epoxy glue) to the ABS hous-\ning. This is important to avoid flow channeling between the re-\ngenerator geometry and the ABS housing;\n\n8. The ABS housing is cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, and assem-\nbled into the G10 casing. This process was designed with a tight\ntolerance between the external ABS diameter and the internal\nG10 diameter to avoid flow channeling/leakage;\n\n9. Finally, the temperature probes and the R-T adapters are con-\nnected.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure B.3 \u2013 (a) Detail in the alignment of the parallel plates geometry;\n(b) Detail in the alignment of the pins array geometry.\n\n\n\n378 Appendix B Assembly of the Regenerative Matrices\n\n\n\n379\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nNusselt Number Correlation for\n\nPacked Beds of Spheres\n\nThe interstitial convective heat transfer coefficient for a packed bed\nof spheres used in the present thesis was calculated using the Nusselt\nnumber correlation of (PALLARES; GRAU, 2010). This correlation was\npreferred to more traditional ones (WHITAKER, 1972; WAKAO; KAGUEI,\n1982), because it is valid for porosities between 0.2 and 0.9 and for a\nwide range of Prandtl numbers (KUWAHARA et al., 2001). The results\ndiscussed along the thesis are such that the particle Reynolds num-\nbers lie between 1 and 500, which for water (Pr ? 6) correspond to\n(Re0.6dp Pr\n\n1/3)2 between 2 and 6 \u00d7103. However, the majority of the data\nin the present experimental data and simulations are for Redp &lt;150, or\n(Re0.6dp Pr\n\n1/3)2 &lt;1350, which is exactly the range where the Wakao and\nKaguei (1982) correlation exhibits the largest discrepancy with respect\nto experimental data (PALLARES; GRAU, 2010). Finally, comparing\nWakao and Kaguei (1982) and Pallares and Grau (2010) correlations\nagainst the experimental data presented in this thesis, Pallares and\nGrau (2010) exhibited a better reproduction of the experimental data,\nas showed in Fig. C.1 that compares the experimental and numerical\nresults, using those Nusselt correlations, for the effectiveness as a func-\ntion of the frequency to Casing#3 and two particle sizes, Fig. C.1(a)\ndp = 0.5 mm and Fig. C.1(b) dp = 0.8 mm. Wakao and Kaguei (1982)\ncorrelation, in general, underestimated the experimental values. The\nsame conclusion can be addressed to the other casings and particle sizes\npresented in this thesis.\n\n\n\n380Appendix C Nusselt Number Correlation for Packed Beds of Spheres\n\n0.91\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.93\n\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n0.99\n\n? ~ 0.31\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.78\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.47\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2 2.25 2.5\n\n(a)\n\n0.95\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n0.98\n\n? ~ 0.31\n\n0.92\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n\n? ~ 0.93\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.78\n\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n\n? ~ 0.62\n\n0.95\n\n0.96\n\n0.97\n\n? ~ 0.47\n\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nE\nff\n\ne\nc\n\nti\nv\n\ne\nn\n\ne\ns\n\ns\n [\n\n-]\n\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2 2.25 2.5\n\nExperimental\nWakao and Kaguei (1982)\nPallares and Grau (2010)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure C.1 \u2013 Effectiveness as a function of frequency for Casing #3:\n(a) dp = 0.5 mm; (b) dp = 0.8 mm."}]}}}
