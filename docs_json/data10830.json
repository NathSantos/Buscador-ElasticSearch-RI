Estas an\u00e1lises num\u00e9ricas enquadram-se na metodologia \nhabitualmente designada por GMNIA \u2013 geometrically and materially non-linear \nimperfect analysis. Ap\u00f3s a valida\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo num\u00e9rico com ensaios experimentais \nda literatura, foi tamb\u00e9m avaliada a influ\u00eancia das imperfei\u00e7\u00f5es geom\u00e9tricas e das \ntens\u00f5es residuais na capacidade resistente das vigas, tanto \u00e0 temperatura normal \ncomo a temperaturas elevadas. \n \nO Euroc\u00f3digo 3 estabelece que a resist\u00eancia \u00e0 encurvadura por esfor\u00e7o transverso de \nvigas em I resulta da soma de duas componentes, a resist\u00eancia da alma e a \ncontribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos banzos. Come\u00e7ou-se por avaliar a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos banzos e \nverificou-se que os resultados obtidos com as express\u00f5es do Euroc\u00f3digo 3 poderiam \nser melhorados. Assim, foi proposta a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de um fator corretivo de forma a \nmelhorar as previs\u00f5es do Euroc\u00f3digo 3 para a contribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos banzos para a \nresist\u00eancia \u00e0 encurvadura por esfor\u00e7o transverso. \n \nA principal parcela da resist\u00eancia \u00e0 encurvadura por esfor\u00e7o transverso \u00e9 dada pela \nalma.

Esta an\u00e1lise demonstrou que a \nalguns dos resultados n\u00e3o est\u00e3o do lado da seguran\u00e7a e que a precis\u00e3o das \nexpress\u00f5es de dimensionamento do Euroc\u00f3digo 3 poderia ser melhorada. Portanto, \nforam propostas altera\u00e7\u00f5es a estas express\u00f5es usadas para o dimensionamento \u00e0 \ntemperatura normal. Para al\u00e9m disso, foram propostas novas express\u00f5es para o \ndimensionamento deste tipo de elementos em caso de exposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao fogo. \n \nA express\u00e3o do Euroc\u00f3digo 3 usada para a verifica\u00e7\u00e3o da seguran\u00e7a de elementos \nestruturais met\u00e1licos sujeitos \u00e0 intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre esfor\u00e7o transverso e momento fletor foi \ntamb\u00e9m avaliada, verificando-se que a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o das propostas para modifica\u00e7\u00e3o das \nexpress\u00f5es usadas para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o da resist\u00eancia \u00e0 encurvadura por esfor\u00e7o \ntransverso origina melhorias nos resultados desta express\u00e3o, principalmente a \ntemperaturas elevadas. \n \nPor fim, apresenta-se uma an\u00e1lise da influ\u00eancia de diferentes par\u00e2metros na \ncapacidade resistente de vigas compostas de alma cheia sujeitas a encurvadura por \nesfor\u00e7o transverso, tais como a espessura da alma, a altura da alma, a espessura dos \nbanzos e a tens\u00e3o de ced\u00eancia do a\u00e7o. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \nkeywords \n\n \n \n \n \nShear buckling, fire, numerical modelling, Eurocode 3.  \n\n \n\nabstract \n\n \nThis thesis is a research work aiming the increasing of knowledge of the behaviour of \nsteel plate girders subjected to shear buckling in fire situation. \n \nThe main objective of this thesis is to overcome the lack of rules for the design of steel \nstructural elements subjected to shear buckling at high temperatures. \n \nFor this purpose, a numerical model was developed in the finite element software \nSAFIR to simulate the behaviour of steel plate girders under shear loading at elevated \ntemperatures. These numerical analyses fall into the methodology commonly referred \nas GMNIA \u2013 geometrically non-linear materially imperfect analysis. After validation of \nthe numerical model with experimental tests from the literature, the influence of the \ngeometric imperfections and residual stresses on the bearing capacity of the girders, at \nboth normal and elevated temperatures, was evaluated. \n \nEurocode 3 states that the shear buckling resistance of steel I girders is given by the \nsum of two components, the web resistance and the contribution from the flanges. \nFirstly it was assessed the contribution from flanges and it was found that the results \nobtained with the Eurocode 3 expressions could be improved. Thus, it was proposed \nthe application of a corrective factor in order to improve the predictions of Eurocode 3 \nfor the contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance. \n \nThe main part of the shear buckling resistance comes from the web. The expressions of \nEurocode 3 for determining the web resistance to shear buckling were evaluated. This \nanalysis demonstrated that some of the results are not on the safe side and the \naccuracy of these expressions could be improved. So, changes to the expressions \napplied for the design at normal temperature were proposed. Furthermore, new \nexpressions for fire design of such structural elements were also proposed. \n \nThe expression of Eurocode 3 used for the safety calculation of steel structural \nelements under interaction between shear and bending was also evaluated. It was \nverified that the application of the proposals for modification of the expressions used to \ndetermine the shear buckling resistance introduces improvements on the results \nprovided by this expression, mainly at elevated temperatures. \n \nFinally, an analysis of the influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear \nstrength of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling, such as the web thickness, \nthe web depth, the flange thickness and the steel yield strength, is presented. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nContents \n\n  xv \n\nContents \n\nList of figures xix \n\nList of tables xxvii \n\nNotation xxxi \n\nChapter 1 Introduction 3 \n\n1.1 Background of the problem 3 \n\n1.2 Motivation and objectives 7 \n\n1.3 Document outline 8 \n\nChapter 2 Literature review 13 \n\n2.1 Behaviour of plate girders under shear 13 \n\n2.2 Tension field models 16 \n\n2.3 Current state of research 22 \n\nChapter 3 Eurocode design rules 29 \n\n3.1 General considerations 29 \n\n3.2 Shear resistance 29 \n\n3.2.1 Resistance from the web to shear buckling 30 \n\n3.2.2 Contribution from the flanges 34 \n\n3.2.3 Verification 36 \n\n3.3 Interaction between shear and bending 37 \n\n3.4 Stiffeners 38 \n\n3.4.1 Transverse stiffeners 41 \n\n3.4.1.1 Rigid end posts 43 \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\nxvi \n\n3.4.1.2 Non-rigid end posts 44 \n\n3.4.1.3 Intermediate transverse stiffeners 45 \n\n3.4.2 Longitudinal stiffeners 46 \n\n3.5 Design at elevated temperatures 46 \n\nChapter 4 Numerical modelling 51 \n\n4.1 Model description 51 \n\n4.1.1 FEM model 51 \n\n4.1.2 Material model 53 \n\n4.1.3 Initial imperfections 56 \n\n4.1.3.1 Geometric imperfections 56 \n\n4.1.3.2 Residual stresses 57 \n\n4.2 Validation of the numerical model 58 \n\n4.2.1 Review of experimental tests 58 \n\n4.2.1.1 Normal temperature 58 \n\n4.2.1.2 Elevated temperatures 61 \n\n4.2.2 Comparisons between numerical and experimental results 63 \n\n4.2.2.1 Normal temperature 63 \n\n4.2.2.2 Elevated temperatures 66 \n\n4.3 Influence of the initial imperfections 68 \n\n4.3.1 Geometric imperfections 68 \n\n4.3.1.1 Normal temperature 68 \n\n4.3.1.2 Elevated temperatures 69 \n\n4.3.2 Residual stresses 70 \n\n4.3.2.1 Normal temperature 70 \n\n4.3.2.2 Elevated temperatures 71 \n\n4.4 Conclusions 72 \n\nChapter 5 Basis for the parametric study 75 \n\n5.1 Characteristics of the analysed plate girders 75 \n\n\n\nContents \n\n  xvii \n\n5.2 Methodology for analysis of results 80 \n\n5.3 Sequence of analysis of the results 82 \n\nChapter 6 Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance 87 \n\n6.1 General considerations 87 \n\n6.2 Evaluation of the EC3 expression to predict the distance between plastic hinges 88 \n\n6.3 Proposal of a corrective coefficient for the EC3 expression to predict the \n\ndistance between plastic hinges 90 \n\n6.4 Influence of the corrective coefficient on design shear resistance 91 \n\n6.4.1 Normal temperature 91 \n\n6.4.2 Elevated temperatures 95 \n\n6.5 Conclusions 99 \n\nChapter 7 Shear buckling resistance 103 \n\n7.1 Failure mechanism 103 \n\n7.2 Evaluation of the EC3 expressions to predict the web resistance to shear \n\nbuckling 108 \n\n7.3 Proposal of new design expressions 119 \n\n7.4 Statistical analysis 124 \n\n7.5 Conclusions 142 \n\nChapter 8 Shear-bending interaction 145 \n\n8.1 Failure modes 145 \n\n8.2 Evaluation of the EC3 expression to check the interaction between shear and \n\nbending 147 \n\n8.3 Statistical analysis 149 \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\nxviii \n\n8.4 Conclusions 152 \n\nChapter 9 Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of \n\nsteel plate girders 155 \n\n9.1 Shear strength in function of cross-section properties 155 \n\n9.1.1.

Introduction \n\n  3 \n\nChapter 1 Introduction \n\n1.1 Background of the problem \n\nSteel plate girders are widely used as structural members in the construction industry \n\ndue to their capacity to support heavy loads over long spans. A plate girder is basically \n\nan I-beam assembled from steel plates which are welded to each other. The common \n\nuses include bridges, medium and long span floors in buildings and crane girders in \n\nindustrial structures (see Figure 1.1).  \n\nNowadays, finding the best cost-effective solution is a must in engineering. In steel \n\nconstruction, to overcome this challenge requires a compromise between weight-cost \n\nand strength which results in the use of slender cross-sections, as those typical from \n\nsteel plate girders. Generally, they are used to carry loads which cannot be economically \n\nsupported by hot-rolled beams. Standard hot-rolled cross-sections may be adequate for \n\nmany of the usual structures, but in situations where the load is heavier and the span is \n\nalso large, its application is usually uneconomical. \n\nThe slender cross-sections of steel plate girders are usually composed by an assembly of \n\nplates which are commonly stated as web (internal element) and flanges (outstand \n\nelements). The web becomes deep and thin to reduce weight, making it susceptible to \n\nbuckling when submitted to compressive stresses, thus affecting the ultimate bearing \n\ncapacity of the plate girder. Therefore, it is common to design plate girders with \n\ntransverse stiffeners and in some cases with longitudinal stiffeners (see Figure 1.2), in \n\norder to increase the buckling strength of the web plates. A good web design comprises \n\nfinding the best combination of plate thickness and distance between transverse \n\nstiffeners that leads to an economic solution regarding material and fabrication costs. \n\nMoving on to some more technical details, it is important knowing that steel plate \n\ngirders are normally subjected to various loading conditions, as for example bending, \n\nshear or patch loading. Each one of its components are designed to support a specific \n\nload, the flanges must resist compressive/tensile forces resulting from the bending stress \n\ndistribution, while the slender webs should be able to withstand heavy shear loads as \n\nwell as concentrated compressive loads due to patch loads. The web together with \n\nstiffeners must be capable to handle the tension field actions that result from shear \n\nbuckling. \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\na) Illinois bridge (MDT, 2011) \n\n \n\nb) Building (SC, 2012) \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Common uses of steel plate girders \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Key elements of a steel plate girder \n\nWeb\n\nTop flange\n\nBottom\n\nflange\n\nEnd panel\n\nTransverse\n\nstiffener\n\nLongitudinal\n\nstiffener\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n  5 \n\nFire is one of the most serious environmental hazards to which a steel structure can be \n\nsubjected during its lifetime. This accidental action may cause a severe impact on steel \n\nstructures, resulting in significant economic and public losses. Historical events suggest \n\nthat fires are a significant hazard to steel bridges, with some of them causing the bridges \n\nto collapse (see Figure 1.3). A research conducted by the New York Department of \n\nTransportation (NYDOT) found that 53 of the total recorded bridge failures up to 2011 \n\nare caused by fires and only 18 are caused by earthquakes (Garlock et al., 2011).  \n\nPeople safe evacuation during a fire requires structural integrity. Steel plate girders are \n\noften placed in key points of buildings due to their capacity to support heavy loads over \n\nlong spans, which highlights their importance and relevance for life safety. The \n\nexposure to elevated temperatures decreases substantially the stiffness and strength of \n\nsteel structural elements and may even change their behaviour when compared to design \n\nat normal temperature (Kodur et al., 2013). \n\nKodur and Naser (2014) found that shear capacity can decrease faster than bending \n\ncapacity meaning the shear limiting state may be a dominant failure mode in steel plate \n\ngirders subjected to fire. However, the results of this thesis showed an opposite trend. \n\nFurthermore, strong differences in the slenderness of the cross-sections, as it is the case \n\nfor plate girders with thin webs and massive flanges, may increase the effect of the \n\nelevated temperatures developed during a fire (Scandella et al., 2014). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Shear buckling in a steel plate girder after fire (Franssen &amp; Vila Real, 2010) \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n6 \n\nOver the past decades, the European Commission developed a set of harmonized \n\nprocedures for the design of construction works, aiming the elimination of technical \n\nobstacles to trade in the Member States of the European Community. These design \n\nprocedures were established and published by the European Committee for \n\nStandardization (CEN) that led to the development of the Structural Eurocodes. The \n\nEurocodes are divided in ten parts (numbered from 0 to 9) addressing different topics: \n\nbasis of structural design; actions necessary for the design of structures; specific rules \n\nand recommendations for structures made of different materials (concrete, steel, \n\ncomposite, timber, masonry and aluminium); earthquake resistance; geotechnical \n\ndesign. \n\nThe Structural Eurocodes were developed with the objective of providing safe, \n\neconomical and, as much as possible, simple procedures for the design of structures. \n\nRegarding fire design, simplified procedures given by those codes of practice are \n\nextremely important for civil engineers who do not always have access to applications \n\ndealing with advanced calculation methods. \n\nEurocode 3 (EC3) is the one devoted to the design of steel structures (Sim\u00f5es da Silva \n\net al., 2010). It is composed by twelve parts (numbered from 1 to 12). The first provides \n\ngeneral rules for the design of steel structures (CEN, 2010a) and the remaining concern \n\nto particular characteristics of steel structures. There are two parts of EC3 with high \n\nrelevance for this work. Part 1-5 of EC3 \u201cPlated structural elements\u201d, also named as EN \n\n1993-1-5 (CEN, 2006b), gives procedures for the design of plated structural elements at \n\nroom temperature. Design rules for steel plate girders affected by shear buckling at \n\nnormal temperature may be found in this part of EC3.  \n\nConcerning fire resistance, Part 1-2 of EC3 \u201cGeneral rules \u2013 Structural fire design\u201d, also \n\nnamed as EN 1993-1-2 (CEN, 2010b), gives prescriptions for the design of steel \n\nstructural elements subjected to elevated temperatures. However, Part 1-2 of EC3 does \n\nnot establish a procedure for checking the shear buckling resistance at elevated \n\ntemperatures. One way to perform fire design is to use the shear design rules at normal \n\ntemperature provided by Part 1-5 of EC3, adapted to fire design by the direct \n\napplication of the reduction factors for stress-strain relationship of carbon steel at \n\nelevated temperatures from Part 1-2 of EC3. \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n  7 \n\n1.2 Motivation and objectives \n\nLocal buckling phenomena are very important for the design of steel structural elements \n\nwith thin-walled cross-sections, as it is the case of steel plate girders. Therefore, these \n\nhave been a common topic of several investigations over the past decades and the \n\ndesign of steel plate girders is well understood at normal temperature.  \n\nFire is a more common hazard than one would first think. However, local buckling in \n\nstructural elements subjected to fire has not been receiving the same attention and only \n\nlimited research has been conducted to predict the ultimate shear strength at elevated \n\ntemperatures. \n\nUnfortunately, this hazard to steel structures is aggravated by the lack of fire design \n\nguidelines in the European Standards. This problem, together with the fact that elevated \n\ntemperatures can cause a substantial reduction in the ultimate shear strength of steel \n\nplate girders, reinforces the interest of this thesis, which allowed evaluating if the \n\nprocedures adopted in Part 1-5 of EC3 for the verification of shear buckling resistance \n\nat normal temperature are suitable for the same verification in case of fire, using the \n\nreduction factors for the steel stress-strain relationship at elevated temperatures. \n\nDue to the limited size of furnaces and the high cost of the fire resistance experimental \n\ntests, several studies about fire resistance of steel structures have been performed in \n\nrecent years based on numerical simulations. However, it is necessary to duly validate \n\nnumerical models before performing parametric studies and calibrated numerical \n\nmodels are still lacking. \n\nThe main objective of this thesis is to develop more comprehensive, safe and economic \n\nguidance on the design of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling, especially \n\nwhen subjected to fire. The overall objective was achieved through the following \n\nparticular objectives: \n\n? to develop numerical models duly calibrated with experimental tests found in the \n\nliterature; \n\n? to perform a solid parametric numerical study in order to generate results on \n\ncommonly used plate girders in buildings; \n\n? to evaluate the accuracy of the expressions implemented in the European \n\nStandards for the design of steel plate girders at normal temperature; \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n8 \n\n? to evaluate the application of the design expressions for normal temperature to \n\nfire design; \n\n? to propose, if necessary, new expressions for design of steel plate girders \n\nsubjected to shear buckling at elevated temperatures; \n\n? to ensure that the proposed expressions are in a format that is readily \n\ndisseminated and used in the European Union by incorporating them into \n\nEuropean Standards; \n\nThis thesis is directly relevant for the construction industry where the use of steel plate \n\ngirders is usual. The research presented here will allow filling the lack of guidance in \n\nthe European Standards for the fire design of this type of structural elements. The \n\nproposed design rules are crucial to produce safe and cost-effective structures, being \n\nrelevant to the life safety and society. Moreover, this thesis does not only result in shear \n\ndesign rules but also deliver a calibrated numerical model which may be relevant for \n\nfuture works of the research community. \n\n1.3 Document outline \n\nThe achievement of the objectives described above is directly related to the realization \n\nof several studies performed during the development of this research. This section \n\nsummarizes the main tasks carried out throughout this research work and how they are \n\norganized in the contents of the thesis.  \n\nThis thesis is organized in 10 Chapters. In Chapter 1 is done a brief introduction about \n\nthe problem under investigation. The motivation and the main objectives are also \n\npresented here, as well as the structure of the document. \n\nThe state of the art is presented in Chapter 2. The literature presented in this chapter is \n\nthe result of a deep bibliographic search for scientific papers and publications dealing \n\nwith the occurrence of shear buckling in steel plate girders. After a brief description of \n\nthe behaviour of plate girders under shear loading, a summary of the theoretical models \n\nhistorically developed to predict the shear resistance of steel plate girders is presented. \n\nFinally, a compilation of the most relevant research developed over the last years is \n\npresented. \n\n\n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n  9 \n\nIn Chapter 3 the prescribed design rules for both normal temperature and fire design, \n\naccording to Part 1-5 and Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b, 2010b), are presented. First, \n\nthe EC3 design procedure is presented, to predict the shear resistance of steel plate \n\ngirders affected by shear buckling at normal temperature. Then, the procedure to \n\nevaluate the interaction between shear and bending is described. Furthermore, the \n\ndesign rules for stiffeners are also presented in this chapter. Finally, the methodology \n\nused to evaluate the shear resistance of steel plate girders exposed to fire is presented, \n\nsince no guidance is given in Part 1-2 of EC3 for the shear buckling evaluation in fire \n\nsituation. \n\nChapter 4 mainly deals with the numerical modelling with SAFIR (Franssen, 2005, \n\n2011) based on the finite element method. This chapter comprises the presentation of \n\nthe numerical model, including boundary conditions and loading, as well as the material \n\nmodel at both normal and elevated temperatures. The initial imperfections incorporated \n\ninto the numerical model are also described in this chapter. Furthermore, the validation \n\nof the numerical model with experimental tests collected from the literature is \n\npresented. The chapter concludes with the presentation of sensitivity analyses about the \n\ninfluence of the geometric imperfections and residual stresses on the numerical \n\nmodelling of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling. \n\nIn Chapter 5 are described the bases for the parametric study presented in the following \n\nchapters. The geometric and material properties of the plate girders analysed at both \n\nnormal and elevated temperatures are presented, as well as the methodology of analysis \n\nof results based on the shear-bending interaction diagram.  \n\nChapters 6 to 8 are dedicated to the analysis and discussion of the numerical results, \n\nresulting from the parametric study considering the girders presented in Chapter 5. The \n\nanalysis of the contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance is \n\npresented in Chapter 6. The EC3 expression to predict the additional resistance given by \n\nthe flanges is evaluated and the application of a corrective coefficient to the expression \n\nused for calculating the distance where the plastic hinges form in the flanges is \n\nproposed.  \n\nIn Chapter 7 a similar analysis is presented for the resistance from the web to shear \n\nbuckling.

Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis of the results is performed. \n\nIn Chapter 8 the evaluation of the interaction between shear and bending is presented. \n\nThe failure modes of the girders are also presented in this chapter, in function of the \n\ndominant effort which causes the collapse. Furthermore, a statistical analysis from the \n\nresults of the girders which fail due to the interaction between shear and bending is \n\npresented. \n\nChapter 9 is dedicated to the study of the influence of different parameters on the \n\nultimate shear strength of steel plate girders. The increase of strength given by the \n\nincrease of the cross-section properties is presented here, as well as the reduction of \n\nstrength caused by the elevated temperatures. In addition, the influence of the \n\nconfiguration of the end posts on the ultimate bearing capacity of steel plate girders is \n\nalso presented. \n\nFinally, general and specific conclusions reached throughout the thesis are presented in \n\nChapter 10, together with suggestions for future research on the behaviour of steel plate \n\ngirders subjected to shear buckling in fire situation. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\nLiterature review \n \n\n \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 Literature review \n\n2.1 Behaviour of plate girders under shear \n\n2.2 Tension field models \n\n2.3 Current state of research \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Literature review \n\n  13 \n\nChapter 2 Literature review \n\n2.1 Behaviour of plate girders under shear \n\nA literature review of relevant research on shear resistance of steel plate girders is \n\npresented in this Chapter. Plate girders are formed by isolated plates that can be \n\nsupported in their ends and subjected to forces in its plane due to shear and bending. \n\nThe behaviour of the girder is defined by the behaviour of these individual plates. The \n\nstresses caused by shear forces and bending moments in a plate girder are represented in \n\nFigure 2.1. The flanges are subjected to uniform normal stresses and the web is \n\nsubjected to non-uniform normal stresses and tangential or shear stresses (Vila Real, \n\n2010). \n\nThick stocky webs reach their ultimate shear strength by material yielding, while thin \n\nslender webs may be susceptible to the occurrence of out-of-plane shear buckling. \n\nHowever, limiting a web under shear stresses to its elastic buckling capacity ???  may be \n\nexcessively conservative due to the additional post-critical strength reserve \n\ncharacteristic of plated elements (see Figure 2.2). The additional post-critical strength \n\ndepends on the web slenderness, with larger gains obtained by plates where the material \n\nyield stress is significantly higher than the elastic critical buckling stress. Plate girders \n\nmay be provided with transverse or longitudinal stiffeners to limit lateral deflections \n\nand thus increase the local buckling resistance. \n\n \n\na) stresses in flanges \n\ndue to bending \n\nb) stresses in web \n\ndue to shear \n\nc) stresses in web  \n\ndue to bending \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Stresses in a plate girder (Vila Real, 2010) \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Post-critical response of slender webs (Beg et al., 2010) \n\nSo the response of a web plate when subjected to shear can be divided in two different \n\nphases: before and after buckling. Before buckling, it is installed a combination of \n\ntensile and compressive stresses with equal magnitude (see Figure 2.3a). The principal \n\ncompressive stress is the main responsible by the buckling of the web plate. After \n\nbuckling, the buckled area of the web plate has no more compression capacity and a \n\nnew load carrying mechanism develops, whereby the additional force is supported by \n\nthe development of a tensile membrane stress field, the so-called \u201ctension field\u201d (see \n\nFigure 2.3b). But, it is only possible if the plate girder has capacity to anchor the tensile \n\nstresses. Some authors consider that when the capacity of tension field is reached, the \n\nflanges contribute to shear buckling resistance of the plate girder (see Figure 2.3c). \n\nThe tension field in a girder with stiffeners is anchored by the flanges and the stiffeners. \n\nBut, even plate girders without transverse stiffeners are capable to achieve an ultimate \n\nshear strength that is much higher than the shear buckling resistance of the web. It is \n\nalso important to note that the flanges clearly bend inwards under the action of the \n\ntension field and its dimension and inclination is highly affected by the rigidity of the \n\nflanges (Porter et al., 1975). The tensile stress grows with the increasing of the applied \n\nloading until the tensile stress combined with the buckling stress reaches the steel yield \n\nstress. The final collapse occurs when the web has yielded and plastic hinges have \n\nformed in the flanges. \n\nAs represented in Figure 2.3, most of the theories about the ultimate strength of plates \n\nsubjected to shear buckling include three components (Eq.

Significant experimental and analytical research has been performed over \n\nthe past century and several tension field models have been developed. Basically, and as \n\nit was described before, the tension field is a membrane stress field that makes the \n\nultimate shear strength of the girder higher than its shear buckling resistance. \n\nAfter buckling, the behaviour of a plate girder is similar to the behaviour of Pratt truss \n\n(see Figure 2.4). Diagonals support the tensile stresses and the posts resist to \n\ncompressive stresses. In this analogy, each panel of a plate girder, limited by transverse \n\nstiffeners, acts as a module of Pratt truss. The web acts as a tensioned member, while \n\ntransverse stiffeners act as compressed members to support the vertical component of \n\ntensile stresses that were developed on the web. Thus, it is assumed that transverse \n\nstiffeners are not loaded before the buckling occurrence and after buckling they are \n\ncompressed (as the posts of Pratt truss). The horizontal component of tensile stresses is \n\nsupported by the flanges of the adjacent panel. \n\n \n\na) Pratt truss \n\n \n\nb) Plate girder \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Analogy between Pratt truss and a plate girder subjected to shear buckling \n\nTensile strip\nRigid end\npost\n\nRigid end\npost\n\nCompressed\n\ntransverse stiffenerReaction Reaction\n\nTensile strip Tensile stripTensile strip\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Literature review \n\n  17 \n\nHistorically, the tension field contribution to the ultimate shear strength of thin plates \n\nwas recognized for the first time by Wilson (1886). Two decades later, investigations of \n\npost-critical behaviour conducted by Foppl (1907) and von Karman (1910) showed that \n\nweb plates normally possess a huge post-critical reserve, but it was mobilized only at \n\nvery large deflections (Bazant, 2000). The development of aeronautical science \n\nstimulated the study of shear resistance capacity of membrane-type structures, such as \n\naircrafts. The condition to design this type of structures \u2013 minimize the self-weight of \n\nthe structure \u2013 led to the utilization of very slender webs, which resulted on the \n\napplication of the tension field concept (Gerv\u00e1sio, 1998). \n\nAccording to Basler (1961a,1961b), the mathematical formulation of tension field effect \n\nwas firstly presented by Rode (1916). The proposal consisted in evaluating the influence \n\nof tension field considering a tensile diagonal with a width equal to 50 times the web \n\nthickness (see Figure 2.5a). However, this theory was never used for design of plate \n\ngirders because it was never experimentally tested. Later, Wagner (1931) presented the \n\npure tension field theory (see Figure 2.5b) for girders with infinitely rigid flanges and \n\nvery thin webs. Wagner developed his formulation based on the assumption that webs \n\nwork as membranes with a uniform tension field, only supporting tensile forces.  \n\nSince then, a lot of investigations were focused on the ultimate shear strength of plate \n\ngirders considering partial tension fields. Lahde and Wagner (1936) published empirical \n\ndata based on deflection measures of buckled rectangular plates. Levy et al. (1945, \n\n1946) studied the case of webs with transverse stiffeners forming square panels. \n\nAfterwards, several tests were conducted by the National Advisory Committee for \n\nAeronautics (NACA) under coordination of Kuhn (1956). However, these initial studies \n\nwere made with the aircraft design goal and had little applicability in the problems \n\nfounded on design of plate girders in structures of buildings and bridges. \n\n \n\na) Rode\u2019s partial tension field b)Wagner\u2019s pure tension field \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 First tension field theoretical models  \n\nVt\n\n50tw\n\nVt Vt Vt\n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n18 \n\nDuring sixties and seventies, the consideration of the post-buckling behaviour of plates \n\nloaded in shear was extended from aeronautical applications to civil engineering. \n\nInvestigations on the post-buckling behaviour of web panels conducted by Basler and \n\nTh\u00fcrlimann (1959a, 1959b) led the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) to \n\nadopt the formulation suggested by them (AISC, 1963). In contrast to the assumption of \n\ninfinitely rigid flanges made by Wagner, Basler and Th\u00fcrlimann assumed \n\nconservatively that flanges are too flexible and thus not capable to support the lateral \n\nloading from tension field. Thus, the tension field would be anchored only in transverse \n\nstiffeners. However, soon after the appearance of this model, experimental results \n\nshown big differences when compared to the results obtained with the theoretical \n\nmodel. First it was assumed it was because the formulation was excessively simplified, \n\nbut the true motive was the no consideration of the flanges resistance. \n\nSince 1960, a lot of variations of the post buckling tension field have been developed \n\nfollowing the Basler-Th\u00fcrlimann model. Significant contributions were made by \n\nRockey and Skaloud (1968, 1972) through experiments and analytical models. It was \n\nfound that the post-buckling behaviour of a plate girder under shear loading was \n\nstrongly influenced by the flexural rigidity of the flanges and the occurrence of collapse \n\ninvolved the formation of plastic hinges in both flanges. Based on these evidences, they \n\nproposed a method to predict the loads for which the webs of I cross-sections fail under \n\nshear, the so called Tension Field Method (Rockey et al., 1974). The precision of this \n\nmodel was established by comparisons with results of 58 tests obtained by various \n\nsources. These comparisons were summarized by Rockey et al. (1978).  \n\nBetween these two limit theories, many researchers have provided various tension field \n\nmodels to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders, incorporating \n\ndifferent positions of the plastic hinges if they are involved in the solution, boundary \n\nconditions of the web panel assumed for calculation of shear buckling stress and \n\ndistributions of tension field action. Among these, the most relevant are the theories \n\npresented by Takeuchi (1964), Chern and Ostapenko (1969), Fujii (1971), Komatsu \n\n(1971), Sharp and Clark (1971), Steinhardt and Schroter (1971), H\u00f6glund (1971a, \n\n1971b) and (Herzog, 1974). The main characteristics of these models are summarised in \n\nTable 2.1. More detailed information about them may be found in Galambos (1988).  \n\n\n\nChapter 2.

In this first version of Part 1-1 of EC3, it was also implemented the \n\nSimple Method of Post Critical Strength, a more conservative method that could be \n\nused for girders with or without transverse stiffeners. In this method the contribution of \n\nthe flanges is not taken into account. Presently, these methods are no longer in the \n\nEuropean Standards and the Rotated Stress Field Method developed by H\u00f6glund (1972) \n\nis the basis of the expressions adopted in Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) for design of \n\nsteel plate girders subjected to shear buckling. \n\nRotated Stress Field Method is based on the assumption that the web panel is under a \n\npure shear stress state that occurs preceding buckling. If these shear stresses ? were \n\ntransformed in principal stresses, they would correspond to principal tensile stresses ?1 \n\nand principal compressive stresses ?2 with equal magnitude (?1 = ?2) and inclined by \n\n45\u00ba relatively to the longitudinal axis of the girder. Once buckling occurs (? = ?cr), the \n\nweb panel has no more compression capacity and it can be assumed that the principal \n\ncompressive stresses (?2) remain equal to the elastic critical buckling stress (?cr). But, \n\nfor webs in shear, there is a substantial post-critical reserve. After buckling, the web \n\nplate achieves the post-critical stress state, while a shear buckle forms in the direction of \n\nthe principal tensile stresses (?1) and the increase of load is resisted by an increase in \n\nthe principal tensile stresses (?1). As a result, stress values of different magnitude occur \n\n(?1 > ?2) which, to keep the equilibrium, leads to a rotation of the stress field. This \n\nmethod is illustrated in Figure 2.6. Detailed information about it may be found in \n\nH\u00f6glund (1972, 1997). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 State of stress in a plate girder subjected to shear with transverse stiffeners at the ends \n\nonly according to the Rotated Stress Field Method (Johansson et al., 2007) \n\nV\nV\n\n?\ns 1\n\n- s 2\n\nT\n\nT\n\ntw\n\ns h\ns h\n\nT\n\nT\n\nNh\nT+\n\nT\n\n(f) shear\nstresses\n\nonly\n\n(g) shear and\n\nmembrane\nstresses\n\n(h)\n\nprincipal\nstresses\n\ns h\n\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\n\nhw\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Literature review \n\n  21 \n\nIn this model, the horizontal component of the tension field (??) acting across the web \n\ndepth is resisted by the end panels, which act as beams resting on the girders flanges. \n\nThese end panels, also called end posts, may be composed by pairs of transverse \n\nstiffeners placed in each side of the girder. They may be designed as rigid or non-rigid. \n\nUnlike other tension field models which are limited to specific aspect ratios (typically \n\n? ??? ? 3), the Rotated Stress Field Model may be applied for all aspect ratios and can \n\nbe equally applied for stiffened and unstiffened plate girders. A reduction factor for the \n\nweb contribution to shear buckling (??) is introduced to allow for initial imperfections \n\nobserved in experimental tests. The predictions of the Rotated Stress Field Method were \n\ncompared with experimental tests, as shown in Figure 2.7. A complete description of \n\nthis method may be found in H\u00f6glund (1997). \n\nIn the last years, the accuracy of these methods at normal temperature have been \n\nextensively analysed by Lee and his research group. The boundary conditions have been \n\nconservatively assumed as simply supported when calculating the elastic critical \n\nbuckling stress, but Lee et al. (1996) stated that the real boundary conditions of the web \n\npanel should be considered in the formulations. Moreover, they concluded that the \n\nboundary conditions are highly influenced by the presence of the flanges (Lee &amp; Yoo, \n\n1998). Recently, based on numerical investigations, Yoo and Lee (2006) found that \n\ncompressive stresses may not remain constant over the web panel, but may increase \n\nprogressively nearness the edges of the web panel where the out-of-plane deflections are \n\nsmaller. It has also been found that Basler\u2019s equation is not applicable to long web \n\npanels (? ?? ? 3? ) since it underestimates their post-buckling strength (Lee et al., \n\n2008). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 Rotated Stress Field Method vs. experimental tests (H\u00f6glund, 1997) \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n22 \n\n2.3 Current state of research \n\nAs already mentioned, the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders was widely \n\nstudied at normal temperature. For that reason, researchers have been focusing their \n\ninvestigations over the past decade on different topics within the ultimate shear strength \n\nof plate girders, such as: design of stainless steel plate girders; interaction between shear \n\nand bending; and fire design of steel plate girders. \n\nSince the procedures for design of carbon steel structures subjected to shear buckling at \n\nnormal temperature were well stablished, stainless steel has become the focus of the \n\nshear buckling study at normal temperature. Traditionally, the stainless steel design \n\nrules have been based on analogies with those adopted for carbon steel, with some \n\nadjustments made when necessary to fit with test results. Olsson (2001) provided a \n\nmethod based on the Rotated Stress Field Method with some modifications in the \n\nexpressions for the calculation of the reduction factor for the web resistance to shear \n\nbuckling and in the definition of the distance where the plastic hinges appear. This \n\nmethod was included in Part 1-4 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a) for the design of stainless steel \n\nplate girders subjected to shear buckling.  \n\nExperimental campaigns were carried out at Polytechnic University of Catalunya (UPC) \n\nto better understand the response of stainless steel plate girders under shear loading \n\n(Real at al., 2007). The comparative analysis of the experimental results with current \n\ncodes\u2019 prescriptions showed that shear design procedures are overly conservative \n\n(Estrada et al., 2007a). The experimental tests results were used by the same authors for \n\ncalibration of numerical models, which were used in an extended numerical analysis \n\ncarried out concerning the evaluation of the post-buckling strength in stainless steel \n\nplate girders (Estrada et al., 2007b). These experimental tests were also used for \n\ncalibration of a numerical model for stainless steel plate girders subjected to shear \n\nbuckling at elevated temperatures (Reis et al., 2016b). The numerical results also \n\nshowed that the prescriptions present in EC3 for the design of stainless steel plate \n\ngirders are too conservative, which led to the development of a new approach based on \n\nthe Rotated Stress Field Method and adequately adapted to the particular features of \n\nstainless steel (Saliba et al., 2014), which was already accepted for incorporation in Part \n\n1-4 of EC3 (CEN, 2006a). \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Literature review \n\n  23 \n\nRecently, the interaction between shear and bending has also become a common topic \n\non the research activities of several authors. Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) has adopted \n\nan expression for the verification of the shear-bending interaction in plate girders, which \n\nis based on slightly modified Basler\u2019s approach (Basler et al., 1960; Basler, 1961b).  \n\nSinur and Beg (2013b) performed experimental tests to better understanding the \n\nbehaviour of steel plate girders subjected to combination of shear force and bending \n\nmoment and to get data for the validation of the numerical model in order to evaluate \n\nthe reliability of the existing models (Sinur &amp; Beg, 2013a). Longitudinally stiffened and \n\nunstiffened webs were considered. It was observed that the resistance strongly depends \n\non the stress distribution in the sub-panels and on the rigidity of the longitudinal \n\nstiffeners. Graciano and Ayestar\u00e1n (2013) concluded that the interaction between shear \n\nand bending may cause a significant reduction on the ultimate resistance of steel plate \n\ngirders. Other authors as K\u00f6vesdi et al. (2014a, 2014b) also studied this topic \n\nconsidering longitudinally unstiffened and stiffened plate girders, resulting on the \n\nproposal of new design expressions. \n\nDespite the growing interest about the fire performance of steel plate girders affected by \n\nshear buckling, only limited experimental tests have been performed at elevated \n\ntemperatures. Vimonsatit et al. (2007) were the first to perform fire resistance \n\nexperimental tests in steel plate girders loaded in shear. They tested transversally \n\nstiffened plate girders with slender webs in a three-point bending configuration at \n\nnormal temperature and under three different uniform temperatures: 400\u00baC, 550\u00baC and \n\n700\u00baC. Tension field action and formation of plastic hinges were observed. Elevated \n\ntemperatures caused a reduction on the ultimate shear strength of approximately 15-\n\n31% at 400\u00baC, 52-66% at 550\u00baC and 78-86% at 700\u00baC.  \n\nTan and Qian (2008) conducted similar tests but with addition of axial restrains in order \n\nto simulate the thermal restraint effects of adjacent cooler parts of steel-framed structure \n\nin fire. It was observed that the ultimate shear strength decreased significantly under a \n\nthermal restraint effect, mainly for the plate girders with more slender webs. These \n\nexperiments are very important since they allow observing the significant degradation \n\nof the ultimate bearing capacity caused by exposing a steel plate girder to elevated \n\ntemperatures such as those which occur during a fire. They are also important in \n\nconfirming that the failure modes observed at normal temperature are also observed at \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n24 \n\nelevated temperatures. Moreover, fire resistance experimental tests are crucial for the \n\nvalidation of numerical models used to perform extended parametric studies (Reis et al., \n\n2016a, 2016b). Thus, these fire resistance experimental tests were part of all \n\nexperimental tests considered for the validation of the numerical model developed \n\nwithin the scope of the study of the shear buckling occurrence in steel plate girders \n\nexposed to fire (Reis et al., 2016c, 2016d). \n\nVimonsatit et al. (2007a) conducted a numerical investigation using a numerical model \n\nduly validated with their fire resistance experimental tests. From this investigation a \n\nnew model to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders subjected to \n\nelevated temperatures has been proposed. This model is based on Rockey\u2019s model \n\n(Rockey et al., 1974) and considers the material properties in function of the \n\ntemperature according to Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2010b). In order to simplify, uniform \n\ntemperature distribution is assumed within the full web depth. \n\nNumerical investigations conducted by Pay\u00e1-Zaforteza and Garlock (2012) and Garlock \n\nand Glassman (2014) indicated that incorporating strain-hardening in material model \n\nhad little effect on the ultimate shear strength and longitudinally restricted models \n\ndeflected substantially less than those that were free. Furthermore, it was possible to \n\nobserve the development of thermal gradients across the cross-section depth.  \n\nA numerical study about thin steel plates loaded in shear at non-uniform elevated \n\ntemperatures was performed by Scandella et al. (2014) in which it was shown that the \n\nnon-uniform temperatures can impose additional loading and even chance the failure \n\nmode. The large differences between the flanges and web thicknesses can lead to a \n\nfaster heating in the web than flanges, resulting in the development of thermally \n\ninduced compressive stresses in the web, which will accelerate the local failure. Thus, a \n\nsteel plate girder with a bending dominant failure at normal temperature may instead \n\nexhibit a shear dominant failure at elevated temperatures with non-uniform heating. \n\nHowever, it is important do not forget the difficulty of implementing in the European \n\nStandards a simple calculation method that includes non-uniform temperatures. \n\nA new design method for predicting the shear resistance of thin steel plate at non-\n\nuniform elevated temperatures has been proposed by Salminen and Heinisuo (2014). \n\nThe basic idea of the method is to reduce the ultimate shear strength of the plate based \n\non a reference temperature, which is hotter than the average temperature but colder than \n\n\n\nChapter 2. Literature review \n\n  25 \n\nthe maximum temperature. The authors suggested that non-uniform temperature \n\ndistributions should be converted into an equivalent uniform temperature, which \n\nhighlights the importance to use simple design methods giving safe predictions.  \n\nAlthough this Chapter is mainly focused on the behaviour of plate girders under shear \n\nloading, it is important to note that in practice plate girders also require bending \n\nresistance and the shear-bending interaction should also be taken into account. \n\nFurthermore, although it has been tried to refer all the essential studies, others relevant \n\nresearch works may have been unconsciously omitted. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3 \n\nEurocode design rules \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 3 Eurocode design rules \n\n3.1 General considerations \n\n3.2 Shear resistance \n\n3.2.1 Resistance from the web to shear buckling \n\n3.2.2 Contribution from the flanges \n\n3.2.3 Verification \n\n3.3 Interaction between shear and bending \n\n3.4 Stiffeners \n\n3.4.1 Transverse stiffeners \n\n3.4.1.1 Rigid end posts \n\n3.4.1.2 Non-rigid end posts \n\n3.4.1.3 Intermediate transverse stiffeners \n\n3.4.2 Longitudinal stiffeners \n\n3.5 Design at elevated temperatures \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3. Eurocode design rules \n\n  29 \n\nChapter 3 Eurocode design rules \n\n3.1 General considerations \n\nIn order to better understand the design formulation proposed in EC3, in first place it is \n\nimportant to understand what a plated structure is: \u201cA plated structure is a structure \n\nbuilt up from nominally flat plates which are connected together; the plates may be \n\nstiffened or unstiffened\u201d (CEN, 2006b). \n\nThis section dedicated to the design procedures is divided in several parts dealing with \n\ndifferent topics. In the first part it is presented the design rules according to Part 1-5 of \n\nEC3 (CEN, 2006b) to determinate the design shear resistance at normal temperatures. \n\nThe second part is dedicated to the interaction between the shear force and the bending \n\nmoment. On the third part some considerations about stiffeners are made and finally, it \n\nis presented the methodology adopted to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate \n\ngirders under fire, based on Parts 1-2 (CEN, 2010b) and 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b). \n\n3.2 Shear resistance \n\nAs mentioned before, Torsten H\u00f6glund developed the so-called Rotated Stress Field \n\nMethod (H\u00f6glund, 1972) which was implemented in Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) \n\nwith some modifications (H\u00f6glund, 1997). Originally, it was developed for girders with \n\nweb stiffeners at the supports only, because the other existing methods were very \n\nconservative for this case. It has in consideration the resistance from the web to shear \n\nbuckling and the resistance contribution from the flanges to the same instability \n\nphenomenon, which are obtained separately. The web resistance to shear buckling \n\nincludes a reduction factor to account for different features which influence the bearing \n\ncapacity of the girders, as for example the initial imperfections. This reduction factor \n\ndepends on the girder end posts: rigid or non-rigid. Girders with rigid end posts are \n\nsupposed to reach higher ultimate loads. \n\nAccording to Part 1-5 of EC3, the shear buckling resistance has to be checked when the \n\nfollowing conditions are satisfied: \n\n? For unstiffened webs: \n??\n\n??\n> 72 \n\n?\n\n?\n \n\n? For stiffened webs: \n??\n\n??\n> 31 \n\n?\n\n?\n ??? \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n30 \n\nwhere ? = ?\n235\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n\n210000\n  with ?? and ? in [MPa]. \n\nIn case these limits are exceeded, the girder should be provided with transverse \n\nstiffeners at the supports. \n\nThe design shear resistance (??,??) is taken as a sum of the resistance from the web to \n\nshear buckling (???,??) and the flanges contribution (???,??). However, the design shear \n\nresistance cannot be higher than the plastic shear resistance of the web alone, as \n\npresented in in Eq. (3.1). \n\n??,?? = ???,?? + ???,?? ? ??  ??  \n? ???\n\n?3 ??1\n      (3.1) \n\nAccording to Part 1-5 of EC3, the recommended values for ? are as follows \n\n? = 1.2 for ?? ? 460 MPa \n\n ? = 1.0 for ?? > 460 MPa  \n        (3.2) \n\nIt is important to note that the National Annexes of EC3 may give different values for ?, \n\ndepending on the field of application. \n\n3.2.1 Resistance from the web to shear buckling \n\nThe contribution from the web to shear buckling resistance may be obtained as follows \n\n???,?? = ??  ??  ??  \n???\n\n?3 ??1\n        (3.3) \n\nThe reduction factor for the web contribution to shear buckling resistance is valid for \n\nboth unstiffened and stiffened webs and may be obtained from Table 3.1. This reduction \n\nfactor is also plotted in Figure 3.1 in function of the web slenderness parameter, \n\ndepending on the end supports (see Figure 3.2).  \n\nAs shown in Figure 3.1, ?? can take values larger than 1.0 for plate girders with steel \n\nyield strength up to 460 MPa due to strain hardening. Tests on stocky beams showed, \n\nfor this range of steel yield strength, that the ultimate shear strength may reach 70% to \n\n80% of the tensile yield strength, which corresponds approximately to an increase of \n\n20% of the shear yield strength. It may be accepted since it does not lead to excessive \n\ndeformations (Beg et al., 2010). \n\n\n\nChapter 3.

For stiffened panels with \n\ntwo or more longitudinal stiffeners, ???  is calculated as the sum of all individual \n\nstiffeners either if they have an equidistant spacing between them or not. More \n\ninformation about stiffeners is presented later in this Chapter.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Notation used to obtain the web slenderness parameter and the shear buckling \n\ncoefficient of a stiffened plate girder \n\n \n\n  \n\na) trapezoidal shape b) L shape \n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Effective cross-section of stiffeners  \n\na a\n\nLongitudinal Stiffener\nTransverse Stiffener\n\nhw\n\nhw1\n\nhw2\n\ntw\n\n30 e tw\n\n15 e tw\n\ntw\n\n15 e tw\n\n15 e tw\n\n15 e tw\n\ntw\n\n30 e tw\n\n15 e tw\n\ntw\n\n15 e tw\n\n15 e tw\n\n15 e tw\n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n34 \n\nDuring the calculation of the shear buckling coefficient (??), a reduction of the moment \n\nof inertia of the longitudinal stiffener (??? ) to 1/3 of its actual value is required. \n\nEqs. (3.8) and (3.9) already take this reduction into account. However, some \n\ninvestigations (Kuhlmann et al., 2007; Pavlov?i? et al., 2007) have shown that such \n\nreduction is only necessary for stiffeners with a small torsional rigidity (e.g. flat bar \n\nstiffeners). Concerning longitudinal stiffeners with large torsional rigidity (e.g. \n\ntrapezoidal shaped stiffeners), the actual value of the moment of inertia may be \n\nconsidered (Beg et al., 2010). \n\nPart 1-5 of EC3 has verification schemes for the case of utilization of intermediate non-\n\nrigid transverse stiffeners, but no formulas are given to determinate the shear buckling \n\ncoefficients for girders provided with this type of stiffeners, with exception of girders \n\nprovided with non-rigid transverse stiffeners at supports only. One solution to this lack \n\nof guidance is to calculate the shear buckling coefficient using adequate software. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, in modern steel structures, intermediate non-rigid \n\ntransverse stiffeners are rarely applied in practice, since the increase of strength may be \n\nvery low. Even intermediate rigid transverse stiffeners are not widely used, because \n\ntheir utilization normally does not compensate the additional cost of welding. \n\n3.2.2 Contribution from the flanges \n\nThe flanges contribution to shear buckling resistance is given Eq. (3.11), which assumes \n\nthe formation of four plastic hinges in the flanges at the distance ? (see Figure 3.5). \n\n???,?? =\n?? ??\n\n2\n\n?\n \n\n???\n\n??1\n [1 ?

This reduction is considered in the last term \n\nof Eq. (3.11). The resistance moment of the cross-section consisting of the effective area \n\nof the flanges only (??,??) is obtained according to Eq. (3.15), being reduced when ???  \n\nis acting.  \n\n??,?? =\n??,?\n\n??0\n [1 ?\n\n???\n\n(??1+??2) \n???\n\n??0\n\n]        (3.15) \n\nwhere \n\n??,? = min(??,1 ???,1 ?? ;  ??,2 ???,2 ?? ) ; \n\n??,1 = ??,1 ??,1 and ??,2 = ??,2 ??,2 are the cross-sectional areas of flange 1 and 2; \n\n???,1 and ???,2 are the yield strengths of flange 1 and 2; \n\n??  is the distance between mid-plane of flanges (see Figure 3.5). \n\nSo Eqs. (3.11) and (3.15) considers an interaction between shear force, bending moment \n\nand normal force for ??? &lt;??,??.

Therefore, in the case of sections with Class 1 or 2, the interaction curve \n\ngiven by Eq. (3.17) must be truncated by the vertical line that cuts the horizontal axis in \n\n???,?? (see Figure 3.7), the plastic resistance bending moment. Regarding sections with \n\nClass 3 or 4, it should be truncated by the vertical line that cuts the horizontal axis in \n\n??,??

Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b) gives, in section 9, design rules for stiffeners \n\nin plated structures and other detailing rules that are important for the evaluation of the \n\nplate buckling resistance. \n\nFigure 3.9 shows the most common situations where transverse and longitudinal \n\nstiffeners are used to increase the resistance of plated structural elements subjected to \n\ndifferent types of loading, such as: direct stresses, shear stresses, patch loading, etc. In \n\nsome cases, the stiffeners design is integrated into the design of the plated elements and, \n\nin other cases, separate checks need to be made (Beg et al., 2010). Figure 3.10 shows \n\nsome typical shapes of stiffeners cross-sections.

Intermediate transverse \n\nstiffeners are usually single-sided, unless they support large concentrated forces, while \n\nthe stiffeners at supports are always double-sided to avoid eccentricity at the \n\nintroduction of large reaction forces (Beg et al., 2010). By another hand, longitudinal \n\nstiffeners have frequently a closed trapezoidal shape because of it great torsional \n\nrigidity, but they can also be open flat bars, T or L shape profiles (see Figure 3.10). \n\ntw\n15et\n\nb\n\nemin\n\nemaxAs As\n\n15et 15et 15et\n\nb=30et\n\nAs As\n\nemin\n\nemax\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Eurocode design rules \n\n  41 \n\nThe cross-sections of open stiffeners are always designed as Class 3 cross-sections or \n\nlower to ensure adequate stiffness. Generally this rule is also applied to closed \n\nstiffeners. However, some new concepts in the design of stiffened plates led to the \n\nchoice of a smaller number of large trapezoidal stiffeners instead of a large number of \n\nsmaller stiffeners. In this case, it may happen that the stiffener belongs to a Class 4 \n\ncross-section, which must be considered in the design procedure. \n\n3.4.1 Transverse stiffeners \n\nTransverse stiffeners have many functions. The most important is to increase the shear \n\nresistance, but they also ensure lateral supports to longitudinal stiffeners and provide \n\nsupport to concentrated transverse forces, being therefore frequently applied at supports \n\nand load points to prevent web crippling. They are commonly designed as rigid \n\nstiffeners and consequently the panels between two rigid transverse stiffeners can be \n\ndesigned individually without interaction with adjacent panels. In Part 1-5 of EC3 are \n\ngiven prescriptions for the design of rigid transverse stiffeners. However, it does not \n\ngive detailed information for the design of flexible transverse stiffeners. \n\nFurthermore, transverse stiffeners should be able to support the deviation forces \n\noriginated from the longitudinal compressive forces of the adjacent panels (NEd), caused \n\nby the inevitable geometrical imperfections. These deviation forces induce out of plane \n\nbending (see Figure 3.12). Transverse stiffeners should be designed not only for \n\nstrength but also for stiffness in order to provide rigid support for the plate. Based on a \n\nsecond order analysis, the following criteria should be satisfied (Beg et al., 2010; \n\nJohansson et al., 2007; CEN, 2006b): \n\n? maximum stress in the stiffener at the ultimate limit state should not exceed the \n\nyield strength (???? ?\n??\n\n??1\n); \n\n? additional lateral deflection ? at the ultimate limit state should not exceed \n\nb/300. \n\nThe scheme used for the verification of transverse stiffeners subjected to direct stresses \n\nis present in Figure 3.12. The transverse stiffener under checking has a sinusoidal \n\ngeometric imperfection with amplitude w0. Both adjacent stiffeners need to be straight \n\nand rigid. The adjacent compressed panels, including longitudinal stiffeners, are \n\nconsidered to be simply supported along the transverse stiffeners.  \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 \u2013 Scheme for rigid transverse stiffeners (Beg et al., 2010; Johansson et al., 2007) \n\nRegarding shear, transverse stiffeners are influenced in two different ways. At the plate \n\nbuckling, rigid transverse stiffeners should prevent the lateral movements of the plate at \n\nthe stiffener position. Thus, adjacent transverse stiffeners should have appropriate \n\nstiffness. Normally, the verification of stiffeners is made only for intermediate \n\nstiffeners, because by definition the stiffeners placed at supports are much stronger. On \n\npost-buckling state, tension field action subject transverse stiffeners to additional axial \n\nforces and induces additional bending moments at the plate girder end posts due to the \n\nanchorage of the tension field. Separate checks for additional axial forces are necessary \n\nonly at intermediate transverse stiffeners, since at stiffeners above the supports all axial \n\nactions are taken into account in the reaction forces considered relevant for their design. \n\nIn the most general case (see Figure 3.13), a transverse stiffener may be loaded with: \n\n? a transverse deviation force (qdev), originated from the longitudinal compressive \n\nforce of the adjacent panels (NEd); \n\n? an external transverse loading (qEd)  in the horizontal direction; \n\n? a compressive force in transverse stiffener (Nst,ext), coming from the external \n\ntransverse loads; \n\n? a compressive force (Nst,ten) in intermediate transverse stiffener due to the \n\ntension field action. \n\nMore information about design of transverse stiffeners may be found in (Beg et al., \n\n2010; Johansson et al., 2007). \n\nw0\n\nb\n\nNed\n\nNed\n\na1\n\na2\n\nadjacent transverse stiffeners\n\ntransverse stiffener to\n\nbe checked\n\nw0 = min [b/300, a1/300, a2/300]\n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Two \n\ndouble-sided stiffeners can be used for this purpose (Beg et al., 2010). Figure 3.14 \n\nshows some details of a rigid end post. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14 \u2013 Rigid end post details \n\nNst,ext\n\nNst,ten\n\nw0 w\nb\n\nqdevqEd\n\nR\n\nAe Au\n\nhw\n\ne\n\ntw\ndouble-sided\n\nstiffeners\n\ntw\ninserted\n\nsection\n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n44 \n\nThe end post is provided of appropriate stiffness and strength if the following conditions \n\nare satisfied: \n\n? ? ? 0.1 ?? \n\n? ?? ?\n4 ?? ?\n\n2\n\n?\n \n\nwhere ? is the centre to centre distance between the stiffeners (see Figure 3.14). \n\nThe second stiffener of an end post with cross-section Au should be checked also as a \n\nbearing stiffener to carry the reaction force R. \n\nWhen end posts are made with inserted profiles, the section modulus of such profiles \n\nshould not be less than 4?? ?\n2, considering bearing around the horizontal axis \n\nperpendicular to the web.  \n\n3.4.1.2 Non-rigid end posts \n\nWhen design criteria for rigid end posts are not satisfied, the end post should be \n\nconsidered as non-rigid. A non-rigid end post consists on the application of a transverse \n\nstiffener on the reaction point. Generally, a single double-sided stiffener may be used as \n\nnon-rigid end post. Figure 3.15 shows an example of a typical configuration of a non-\n\nrigid end post, where it may act as bearing stiffener for the reaction. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15 \u2013 Non-rigid end post details \n\n \n\nR\n\n\n\nChapter 3. Eurocode design rules \n\n  45 \n\n3.4.1.3 Intermediate transverse stiffeners \n\nAn intermediate transverse stiffener is considered rigid for shear buckling of the plate if \n\nthe following conditions are satisfied: \n\n? ??? ?\n1.5 ??\n\n3  ?3\n\n?2\n          ???   ? =\n\n?\n\n??\n&lt;?2 \n\n? ??? ? 0.75 ??  ?\n3     ???   ? =\n\n?\n\n??\n? ?2 \n\nwhere ???  is the moment of inertia of an intermediate transverse stiffener with a cross-\n\nsection according to Figure 3.11, for the parallel axis to the web plate. Normally, the \n\nresults given by the expressions presented above do not lead to very strong stiffeners. \n\nThe tension field action imposes an axial force Nst,ten in the intermediate transverse \n\nstiffener that may be determined as follows \n\n???,??? = ??? ?\n1\n\n????\n2  ??  ??  \n\n??\n\n?3 ??1\n       (3.18) \n\nAt variable shear forces, ??? is taken at the distance 0.5 ??  from the edge of the panel \n\nwith the largest shear force (see Figure 3.16). Note that the values given by Eq. (3.18) \n\nare very conservative (by a factor 2 or more) and overestimates the level of the axial \n\nforce (Beg et al., 2010). This may be problematic, mainly for single-sided stiffeners \n\nwhere eccentric introduction of the axial force should be taken into account. When \n\nEq. (3.18) gives a negative value, the axial force Nst,ten should be considered equal to 0. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16 \u2013 Development of axial force in the intermediate transverse stiffener \n\nNst,ten\n\nhw\n\naa\n\nVEd,max\n\nVEd\n\n0.5 hw\n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n46 \n\n3.4.2 Longitudinal stiffeners \n\nLongitudinal stiffeners are used to increase the shear resistance, the resistance to direct \n\nstresses or the resistance to patch loading (see Figure 3.9). Typically they are designed \n\nto be most effective. Generally this is achieved when an increase in resistance of the \n\nstiffener\u2019s cross-section does not result in a significant strength enhancement by the \n\nstiffened plate. When stiffened plates are loaded in shear, no special design checks are \n\nneeded for longitudinal stiffeners. Their influence is considered when calculating the \n\nshear buckling coefficient ??of the stiffened panel (Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9)). \n\n3.5 Design at elevated temperatures \n\nAs presented, the ultimate shear strength at normal temperature of steel plate girders is \n\nobtained according to Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b). In the European Standards there is \n\none part that is dedicated to structural fire design of steel structures, Part 1-2 (CEN, \n\n2010b). However, no guidance is given in Part 1-2 of EC3 for the shear buckling \n\nevaluation in fire situation. Thus, the design prescriptions at normal temperature, \n\nadapted to fire situation by the direct application of the reduction factors for the stress-\n\nstrain relationship of steel at elevated temperatures, are used. The reduction factors used \n\nin this procedure are presented in Table 3.2 and plotted in Figure 3.17. The reduction \n\nfactor to reduce the steel yield strength at elevated temperatures of profiles with Class 4 \n\ncross-sections, given in Annex E of Part 1-2 of EC3, is also presented. \n\nWhen checking the ultimate shear strength in fire situation, ??,? is used to consider the \n\nreduction of the steel yield strength caused by the elevated temperatures, whereas ??,? \n\nis applied to reduce the Young\u2019s modulus in Eq. (3.19) (Franssen &amp; Vila Real, 2010), \n\nfor the calculation of the parameter ?? necessary for obtaining the web slenderness \n\nparameter at elevated temperatures ????,?. Finally, ?0.2?,? is used for Class 4 cross-\n\nsections to consider the reduction of the flanges resistance to the bending moment at \n\nelevated temperatures. It is important to note that ??,? is only used to build the \n\nconstitutive law presented in Figure 4.3. \n\n?? = ?\n235\n\n?? ??,?\n ?\n\n? ??,?\n\n210000\n         (3.19) \n\nwith ?? and ? in [MPa]. \n\n\n\nChapter 3.

Numerical modelling \n\n  51 \n\nChapter 4 Numerical modelling \n\n4.1 Model description \n\n4.1.1 FEM model \n\nIn engineering practice, the resistance of steel plate girders can be determined in \n\ndifferent ways, i.e. by means of experimental tests, computer simulations or using \n\navailable formulae in design codes. Herein, the ultimate shear strength of steel plate \n\ngirders is calculated by means of non-linear finite element analysis and then the \n\nnumerical values are compared with the codes predictions in the next Chapters. \n\nThe 3-D models for steel plate girders loaded in a three-point bending were developed \n\nusing the FEM software SAFIR (Franssen, 2005, 2011), a computer software developed \n\nat University of Liege for the simulation of the behaviour of structures subjected to fire. \n\nThe plates of the web, flanges and stiffeners were discretized into several quadrangular \n\nshell elements with 4 integration nodes and 6 degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 \n\nrotations). These shell elements adopt the Kirchhoff's theory formulation and have been \n\npreviously validated by Talamona and Franssen (2005).  \n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed in order to find the necessary mesh refinement to \n\nobtain reliable results (see Figure 4.1). A mesh refinement with 30 elements in the web, \n\n10 elements in the flanges and 100 divisions per meter of beam length, which amounts \n\nto 5000 finite elements per meter of beam length, was considered adequate to accurately \n\nrepresent the beam behaviour, as marked with a circle in Figure 4.1. The integration on \n\nthe shell element follows a Gauss scheme with 4 nodes on the surface and 4 levels \n\nthrough the thickness. \n\nThe boundary conditions are presented in Table 4.1 and illustrated in Figure 4.2. Lateral \n\ntorsional buckling was prevented through the application of lateral bracings in the upper \n\nflange equidistantly at L/10 (see Figure 4.2). The loading were applied to the model as \n\nforces at mid-span, distributed on the entire web depth in order to avoid numerical \n\nproblems (see Figure 4.5). The plate girders were always provided with transverse \n\nstiffeners at the load points, i.e. at the girder ends and at mid-span.  \n\n \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n52 \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Boundary conditions (? \u2013 displacement, ? \u2013 rotation; 0 \u2013 free, 1 \u2013 fixed) \n\nBoundary ?x ?y ?z ?x ?y ?z \n\nLeft support \nWeb 0 1 0 0 0 0 \n\nLower flange 0 0 1 0 0 0 \n\nRight support \nWeb 0 1 0 0 0 0 \n\nLower flange 1 0 1 0 0 0 \n\nLateral bracings Upper flange 0 1 0 0 0 0 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Mesh refinement sensitivity analysis \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Numerical model \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000\n\nU\nlt\n\nim\na\nte\n\n L\no\na\nd\n\n [\nk\n\nN\n]\n\nNumber of elements\n\n\n\nChapter 4. Numerical modelling \n\n  53 \n\n4.1.2 Material model \n\nThe bi-linear material model with a yielding plateau was used in the analyses at 20\u00baC, \n\naccording to Annex C of Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b). For elevated temperatures with \n\nheating rates between 2 and 50\u00baC/min, the steel mechanical properties of resistance and \n\ndeformability may be obtained according to the recommendations presented in Clause \n\n3.2.2 of Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2010b). The parameters given in Table 4.2 are the \n\nparameters involved on the determination of the steel stress-strain relationship at \n\nelevated temperatures presented in Figure 4.3, which was the steel material law \n\nconsidered in the numerical modelling. Strain-hardening was not considered in the steel \n\nmaterial law at both normal and elevated temperatures.  \n\nAt elevated temperatures, the shape of the stress-strain curve is modified compared to \n\nthe shape at room temperature. However, it is important to note that the bi-linear \n\nconstitutive law with a yielding plateau and without strain-hardening used for normal \n\ntemperature is compatible with the constitutive law for elevated temperatures, meaning \n\nthat at 20\u00baC they are the same. At 20\u00baC ?,pf  is equal to yf  resulting in ?? ?? ,, yp ? , \n\nwhich leads to not having the transition phase that follows the equation of an ellipse and \n\nhaving again an elastic-plastic law without strain hardening. \n\nThe stress-strain steel curve at elevated temperatures may be divided into four zones: \n\n? the first is a linear zone until the proportional limit. This relation can be \n\ndescribed by the Hooke law with the modulus of elasticity ??,?; \n\n? the second is a transition phase that follows the equation of an ellipse (Rubert &amp; \n\nSchaumann, 1985) and stops at the yield strength, considered as the stress at 2 % \n\nof total strain. This phase corresponds to the beginning of the yielding; \n\n? the third represents the yield (plastic zone), characterized by values of constant \n\nstresses equal to the yield strength; \n\n? the fourth zone relates to a linear decreasing branch, which was introduced to \n\nrepresent the softening of the steel and to achieve finite numerical ductility. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n54 \n\nTable 4.2 \u2013 Expressions to define the steel stress-strain relationship at elevated temperatures \n\nStrain range Stress ?

As the global buckling was restrained by the \n\napplication of lateral bracings in the upper flange, only local imperfections were \n\nconsidered. The shape for the geometric imperfections was taken as the first eigenmode \n\nof a linear buckling analysis. A procedure written in CAST3M (CEA, 2012) was used to \n\nobtain the eigenmodes, being the interface between SAFIR and CAST3M assured by \n\nRUBY (Couto et al., 2013). Figure 4.5 shows an example of the shape of a first \n\neigenmode resulting from a linear buckling analysis. \n\nRegarding the maximum amplitude considered for the geometric imperfections, two \n\ndifferent situations need to be considered. On the one hand, if one is modelling \n\nexperimental tests, the pattern of the geometric imperfections observed in the \n\nexperiments should be taken into account. When the geometric imperfections were not \n\nmeasured in the experimental test, a maximum amplitude of the geometric \n\nimperfections equal to tw/10 was considered on the simulation of the experimental tests \n\nfor the validation of the numerical model, as used in different studies of plate buckling \n\nat normal temperature (Hancock, 1981; Real et al., 2007) and at elevated temperature \n\n(Quiel &amp; Garlock, 2010). \n\nOn the other hand, if one is evaluating the accuracy of design expressions adopted in the \n\nEuropean Standards, the worst case scenario should be considered. Therefore, the \n\nmaximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections is generally more severe in \n\nnumerical studies concerning the evaluation of design expressions, when compared to \n\nthe one used for modelling of experimental tests. Thus, in the parametric numerical \n\nstudies performed in this thesis, the maximum amplitude was considered equal to 80% \n\nof the essential manufacturing tolerances for welded profiles, obtained from EN 1090-2 \n\n(CEN, 2011), as recommended in Part 1-5 of EC3 (CEN, 2006b). Accordingly, the \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

A shear dominant failure mode characterized by the \n\nweb shear buckling was observed. The girders were simply supported and the loading \n\nwas applied at mid-span. Figure 4.8 shows the geometry of the tested girders. The \n\ngirders dimensions and the material properties are presented in Table 4.3 and Table 4.4, \n\nrespectively. The width of the transverse stiffeners is half of the flanges width and the \n\nhorizontal dimension of the two small end panels is 300 mm. All transverse stiffeners \n\nhave 6 mm thickness (??) with exception of those placed at the supports forming the \n\nnon-rigid end post which have 10 mm thickness.  \n\n \n\na) girders with 400 mm web depth (PG1 and PG4) \n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\ntw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\nts\n\nP\n\n10 mm\n\nbf\n\nhw\ntw\n\ntf\n\nae\n\nL\n\nts10 mm\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

This was the first \n\nreported experimental work under elevated temperatures in the scope of shear buckling \n\nin steel plate girders. A total of 18 plate girders were tested, divided into five series. \n\nBeams with stocky hot-rolled cross-sections were tested in the two first series and for \n\nthis reason they are not studied in this work. Only two series involving 8 plate girders \n\nwith slender web panels that fail by shear are modelled in this thesis, since some \n\ntechnical problems were registered in one of the experimental series and the results \n\nwere not good. The girders are simply supported and the loading is applied at the mid-\n\nspan. They were tested at elevated temperatures in electrical heating furnaces under \n\nsteady-state conditions. The temperature was applied uniformly until the girder reached \n\nthe specified temperature and after that the loading was applied until failure. The \n\ngeometry of the girders is presented in Figure 4.10. The thickness of the flange stiffener \n\nis 12 mm and a same thickness for the transverse stiffeners was assumed. The \n\ndimensions and the material properties of the girders are presented in Table 4.5 and \n\nTable 4.6, respectively. \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\na) PG15-18 \n\n \n\nb) PG19-22 \n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Geometry of the plate girders tested at the Nanyang Technological University \n\n \nTable 4.5 \u2013 Dimensions of the plate girders tested at elevated temperatures \n\nLabel Reference \nT \n\n[\u00baC] \n\nL \n[mm] \n\na \n[mm] \n\ne \n[mm] \n\nhw \n[mm] \n\ntw \n[mm] \n\nbf \n[mm] \n\ntf \n[mm] \n\nts \n[mm] \n\ntls \n[mm] \n\nbls \n[mm] \n\na/hw   \n\n[-] \n\nPG15 \n\nVimonsatit \n\net al. \n\n(2007b) \n\n20 1660 305 120 305 2.0 80 6.0 12.0 - - 1.00 \n\nPG16 400 1660 305 120 305 2.0 80 6.0 12.0 - - 1.00 \n\nPG17 565 1660 305 120 305 2.0 80 6.0 12.0 - - 1.00 \n\nPG18 690 1660 305 120 305 2.0 80 6.0 12.0 - - 1.00 \n\nPG19 20 1660 305 120 305 1.5 80 6.0 12.0 - - 1.00 \n\nPG20 400 1660 305 120 305 1.5 80 6.0 12.0 - - 1.00 \n\nPG21 550 1660 305 120 305 1.5 80 6.0 12.0 - - 1.00 \n\nPG22 700 1660 305 120 305 1.5 80 6.0 12.0 - - 1.00 \n\n \n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\nts tw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\nts tw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\n200 mm\n\n240 mm240 mm 1420 mm\n\n80 mm\n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\nts tw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\nts tw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\nts tw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\n200 mm\n\n240 mm240 mm 1420 mm\n\n80 mm\n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\nts tw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\nts tw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\nts tw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\n200 mm\n\n240 mm240 mm 1420 mm\n\n80 mm\n\nae\n\nL\n\nbf\n\nhw\nts tw\n\ntf\n\nP\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

The \n\naverage deviation between the numerical and the experimental tests was 1.5%. It was \n\ncalculated in absolute. As it can be seen in Table 4.7, the maximum conservative \n\ndeviation was 2.8% and the maximum not conservative deviation was 1.7%. \n\nThe out of plane web buckling observed in PG2 is illustrated in Figure 4.11. Figures \n\n4.12 and 4.13 show the web buckling at the end of the test of plate girders with aspect \n\nratio equal to 1.5 and 2.0, respectively. As shown in these figures, the failure modes \n\nnumerically obtained are quite similar to those observed in the experimental tests, \n\nparticularly the web shear buckling and the formation of plastic hinges in the flanges. \n\nTable 4.7 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical and experimental results of the steel plate girders \n\ntested by Lee and Yoo \n\nLabel \nUltimate load [kN] Deviation [%] \n\nExp. test (1) SAFIR (2) [(2)-(1)]/(1) \n\nPG1 564.9 560.1 -0.8 \n\nPG2 664.9 662.6 -0.3 \n\nPG3 674.7 680.3 0.8 \n\nPG4 537.6 523.0 -2.7 \n\nPG5 572.7 582.7 1.7 \n\nPG6 625.7 609.2 -2.6 \n\nPG7 517.8 517.2 -0.1 \n\nPG8 552.9 537.5 -2.8 \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n64 \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.11 \u2013 Numerical and experimental (Lee &amp; Yoo, 1999) out of plane web buckling in the non-\n\nrigid end post of PG2 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.12 \u2013 Numerical and experimental (Lee &amp; Yoo, 1999) deformed shape after test of PG4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13 \u2013 Numerical and experimental (Lee &amp; Yoo, 1999) deformed shape after test of PG7 \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

The ultimate loads obtained in the experimental tests \n\nare compared with those resulting from the numerical model. The results are presented \n\nin Table 4.8. Through the comparison of results it is possible to observe that the \n\nnumerical model provides a good aproximation to the actual behaviour of the tested \n\ngirders, with an average deviation equal to 4.1%. The average deviation was determined \n\nin absolute. Table 4.8 shows a maximum conservative deviation of 9.7% and a \n\nmaximum not conservative deviation of 4.9%, which is considered acceptable. Figure \n\n4.14 shows the similarity between the failure modes observed after the numerical and \n\nexperimental tests of PG13, a plate girder provided with a longitudinal stiffener. The \n\nshear buckling in the web panel may be observed in both experimental and numerical \n\ntests. Moreover, flange buckling may also be observed. \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.14 \u2013 Numerical and experimental (Gomes et al., 2000) deformed shape after test of PG13 \n\n \n\nTable 4.8 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical and experimental results of the steel plate girders \n\ntested at the University of Minho \n\nLabel \nUltimate load [kN] Deviation [%] \n\nExp. test (1) SAFIR (2) [(2)-(1)]/(1) \n\nPG9 110.0 113.0 2.8 \n\nPG10 110.0 115.4 4.9 \n\nPG11 150.0 143.9 -4.1 \n\nPG12 130.0 132.0 1.5 \n\nPG13 133.0 135.3 1.7 \n\nPG14 172.0 155.4 -9.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n66 \n\nThe graphical comparison between the numerical and experimental results of all the \n\nanalysed plate girders at normal temperature is presented in Figure 4.15.

The ultimate \n\nloads of the overall test results are presented in Table 4.9, as well as a comparison \n\nbetween the numerical and the experimental results. A good agreement between the \n\nresults of the numerical model developed in SAFIR and the experiments was obtained.  \n\nFrom the results at normal temperature (PG15 and PG19), an average deviation between \n\nSAFIR and the experimental tests equal to 4.6% was observed, whereas the results \n\nobtained from the authors using MARC software presented a 13.8% average deviation \n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n\nPSAFIR [kN]\n\nPEXP [kN]\n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Figure 4.16 and Figure 4.17 show the similarity on the web \n\nshear buckling observed in the experimental tests and numerical simulations for two of \n\nthe analysed plate girders. Finally, the experimental and numerical results obtained at \n\nelevated temperatures are plotted in Figure 4.18. \n\nIt was shown that the numerical model developed in SAFIR provides a good \n\napproximation to the actual behaviour of steel plate girders at both normal and elevated \n\ntemperatures. Therefore, the numerical model is considered duly validated. \n\nTable 4.9 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical and experimental results of the steel plate girders \n\ntested at the Nanyang Technological University \n\nLabel T [\u00baC] \nUltimate load [kN] Deviation [%] \n\nExp. test (1) MARC (2) SAFIR (3) [(2)-(1)]/(1) [(3)-(1)]/(1) \n\nPG15 20 159.7 176.0 156.6 10.2 -2.0 \n\nPG16 400 135.3 132.0 128.8 -2.4 -4.8 \n\nPG17 565 68.7 76.8 74.6 11.8 8.6 \n\nPG18 690 34.3 32.8 32.1 -4.4 -6.3 \n\nPG19 20 119.2 140.0 110.6 17.4 -7.2 \n\nPG20 400 92.8 106.8 89.7 15.1 -3.3 \n\nPG21 550 57.2 65.0 56.3 13.6 -1.5 \n\nPG22 700 20.3 23.4 20.2 15.2 -0.6 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.16 \u2013 Numerical and experimental deformed shape after test of PG16 \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n68 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 \u2013 Numerical and experimental deformed shape after test of PG21 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 \u2013 Experimental and numerical ultimate resistance of all the analysed steel plate girders \n\nat elevated temperatures \n\n4.3 Influence of the initial imperfections \n\n4.3.1 Geometric imperfections \n\n4.3.1.1 Normal temperature \n\nBased on the configuration of the steel plate girders tested by Lee and Yoo (1999), \n\nwhose geometry and dimensions were presented in section 4.2.1, a sensitivity analysis \n\nabout the influence of the maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections (m.a.g.i.) \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n\nPSAFIR [kN]\n\nPEXP [kN]\n\n\n\nChapter 4. Numerical modelling \n\n  69 \n\non the ultimate shear strength has been performed. Different maximum amplitudes of \n\nthe geometric imperfections were considered based on the web thickness (tw, tw/2, tw/10 \n\nand tw/100), as well as the maximum amplitude recommended in EC3 (0.8bf/100 in the \n\nflanges and 0.8hw/100 in the web), as stated in section 4.1.3.1.  \n\nThe results are presented in Table 4.10 listed from highest to lowest maximum \n\namplitude. As expected, the higher the maximum amplitude is, the more conservative \n\nthe results are. Comparing numerical and experimental results, the average deviation is \n\n4.6% on safe side when the maximum amplitude recommended in EC3 is used. When \n\nthe maximum amplitude is taken as 10% of the web thickness the average deviation is \n\n0.9% on the safe side. Finally, considering a maximum amplitude equal to 1% of the \n\nweb thickness is too soft, being the average deviation 1.2% on the unsafe side, i.e. the \n\nultimate loads numerically obtained are generally higher than those observed in the \n\nexperimental tests. Furthermore, the consideration of the maximum amplitude \n\nrecommended in EC3 is too severe for the numerical modelling of experimental tests, \n\nbeing tw/10 an appropriate value to use for that purpose. \n\nTable 4.10 \u2013 Geometric imperfections sensitivity analysis at normal temperature \n\n Maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections (m.a.g.i.) \n\nExp. test tw EC3 tw/2 tw/10 tw/100 \n\nLabel a/hw \nP \n\n[kN] \n\nP \n\n[kN] \n\nDev. \n\n[%] \n\nP \n\n[kN] \n\nDev. \n\n[%] \n\nP \n\n[kN] \n\nDev. \n\n[%] \n\nP \n\n[kN] \n\nDev. \n\n[%] \n\nP \n\n[kN] \n\nDev. \n\n[%] \n\nPG1 1.00 564.9 515.7 -8.7 518.0 -8.3 527.3 -6.6 560.1 -0.8 585.5 3.7 \n\nPG2 1.00 664.9 652.9 -1.8 651.8 -2.0 654.7 -1.5 662.6 -0.3 665.2 0.0 \n\nPG3 1.00 674.7 670.0 -0.7 669.2 -0.8 672.1 -0.4 680.3 0.8 682.9 1.2 \n\nPG4 1.50 537.6 468.6 -12.9 475.5 -11.6 489.5 -9.0 523.0 -2.7 558.4 3.9 \n\nPG5 1.50 572.7 564.2 -1.5 561.0 -2.0 574.0 0.2 582.7 1.7 584.7 2.1 \n\nPG6 1.50 625.7 591.1 -5.5 590.9 -5.6 598.8 -4.3 609.2 -2.6 610.7 -2.4 \n\nPG7 2.00 517.8 512.9 -1.0 510.1 -1.5 520.0 0.4 517.2 -0.1 527.4 1.9 \n\nPG8 2.00 552.9 528.9 -4.3 524.8 -5.1 539.1 -2.5 537.5 -2.8 549.2 -0.7 \n\nAverage deviation [%]  -4.6  -4.6  -3.0  -0.9  1.2 \n\n \n\n4.3.1.2 Elevated temperatures \n\nThe influence of the maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections was also \n\nanalysed under fire conditions using the same plate girders analysed at normal \n\ntemperature (see Table 4.11). In this case, the plate girders are subjected to three \n\ndifferent uniform temperatures (350\u00baC, 500\u00baC and 600\u00baC) under steady-state conditions, \n\ni.e. the temperature is considered constant while the load is increased. Two different \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n70 \n\nmaximum amplitudes were considered: the one used in the modelling of experimental \n\ntests and the one recommended in EC3. It was found that considering geometric \n\nimperfections causes a significant reduction on the ultimate shear strength and not \n\nconsidering them conducts to unrealistic shear buckling resistances. However, at \n\nelevated temperatures the maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections has no \n\nsignificant influence on the ultimate capacity of the analysed plate girders. The average \n\ndeviation is equal to 0.6% for all the analysed temperatures.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.11 \u2013 Geometric imperfections sensitivity analysis at elevated temperatures \n\nLabel a/hw \n\n350\u00baC 500\u00baC 600\u00baC \n\ntw/10 \n\nP [kN] \n\nEC3 \n\nP [kN] \n\nDev. \n\n[%] \n\ntw/10 \n\nP [kN] \n\nEC3 \n\nP [kN] \n\nDev. \n\n[%] \n\ntw/10 \n\nP [kN] \n\nEC3 \n\nP [kN] \n\nDev. \n\n[%] \n\nPG1 1.00 450.0 451.8 0.4 349.1 350.4 0.4 207.1 207.9 0.4 \n\nPG2 1.00 529.5 531.0 0.3 409.4 410.7 0.3 241.2 242.1 0.4 \n\nPG3 1.00 568.9 571.0 0.4 441.2 443.0 0.4 260.9 262.0 0.4 \n\nPG4 1.50 375.2 375.9 0.2 290.3 290.5 0.1 170.9 171.2 0.2 \n\nPG5 1.50 438.5 440.8 0.5 337.8 339.6 0.5 197.5 198.5 0.5 \n\nPG6 1.50 503.4 505.9 0.5 390.1 392.1 0.5 229.7 231.1 0.6 \n\nPG7 2.00 364.0 368.3 1.2 278.8 282.0 1.1 161.5 163.3 1.2 \n\nPG8 2.00 382.5 388.9 1.7 294.7 299.5 1.6 172.1 174.7 1.5 \n\n   Average deviation [%]  0.6   0.6   0.6 \n \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Residual stresses \n\n4.3.2.1 Normal temperature \n\nThe authors of the experimental tests did not measure the residual stresses and therefore, \n\nthey were not considered in the validation of the numerical model. However, in this \n\nsection their influence on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders is evaluated. \n\nFor taking the residual stresses into account, SAFIR transform them into residual strains \n\nand add them to the other strains in the first calculation (Franssen, 1993; Lopes et al., \n\n2010). The pattern of residual stresses considered was the one presented in Figure 4.6. \n\nOne may observe that the influence of the residual stresses on the ultimate shear \n\nstrength of steel plate girders is high, with the ultimate loads of the analysed girders on \n\naverage 8.6% lower when a maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections equal \n\nto tw/10 is used. When a higher maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections is \n\nconsidered, like the one recommended in EC3, the reduction on the ultimate loads is not \n\nso high, being on average 5.3%. \n\n\n\nChapter 4.

Table 4.13 shows the influence of the residual stresses on the ultimate shear \n\nstrength of steel plate girders subjected to elevated temperatures. It is shown that there \n\nis no substantial reduction on the ultimate loads of the analysed plate girders and, \n\nconsequently, one can conclude that the residual stresses do not need to be taken into \n\naccount on the numerical analysis of steel plate girders subjected to elevated \n\ntemperatures.  \n\nThe results showed that residual stresses are not so important for the ultimate shear \n\nstrength of steel plate girders exposed to fire. Tide (1998) and Quiel and Garlock (2010) \n\naffirm that a relaxation of initial residual stresses is likely to occur when a steel member \n\nis exposed to fire due to an increase in steel temperature. However, it is important \n\nbearing in mind that the evolution of the residual stresses when a profile is exposed to \n\nfire is not very well known and their influence may not be always considered \n\nappropriately in the numerical calculation (Franssen, 1993). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n72 \n\nTable 4.13 \u2013 Residual stresses sensitivity analysis at elevated temperatures \n\nLabel \n\nWith imperfections only With imperfections plus residual stresses \n\nm.a.g.i.=tw/10 m.a.g.i.=EC3 m.a.g.i.=tw/10 m.a.g.i.=EC3 \n\nP [kN] P [kN] P [kN] Deviation [%] P [kN] Deviation [%] \n\nPG1 349.1 350.4 348.8 -0.1 350.2 -0.1 \n\nPG2 409.4 410.7 409.0 -0.1 409.9 -0.2 \n\nPG3 441.2 443.0 440.0 -0.3 441.7 -0.3 \n\nPG4 290.3 290.5 289.7 -0.2 290.0 -0.2 \n\nPG5 337.8 339.6 337.2 -0.2 338.7 -0.3 \n\nPG6 390.1 392.1 389.3 -0.2 390.8 -0.3 \n\nPG7 278.8 282.0 276.9 -0.7 280.4 -0.6 \n\nPG8 294.7 299.5 292.5 -0.7 297.5 -0.7 \n\nAverage deviation [%]  -0.3  -0.3 \n\n \n\n4.4 Conclusions \n\nBased on the work presented in Chapter 4, the following general conclusions are drawn: \n\n? The numerical model developed in SAFIR is able to accurately reproduce the \n\nbehaviour of steel plate girders under shear loading at both normal and elevated \n\ntemperatures; \n\n? Do not have into account the geometric imperfections conduct to unrealistic \n\nshear buckling resistances; \n\n? The maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections has significant \n\ninfluence on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders analysed at normal \n\ntemperature. However, it is not relevant in fire situation; \n\n? The higher the maximum amplitude is, the more conservative the results are; \n\n? The application of the maximum amplitude recommended in EC3 is too severe for \n\nthe numerical modelling of experimental tests. An appropriate value to use for that \n\npurpose is tw/10; \n\n? Residual stresses cause a considerable reduction of bearing capacity of steel plate \n\ngirders affected by shear buckling at normal temperature. However, they have no \n\nsubstantial influence at elevated temperatures. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5 \n\nBasis for the parametric study \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n74 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5 Basis for the parametric study \n\n5.1 Characteristics of the analysed plate girders \n\n5.2 Methodology for analysis of results \n\n5.3 Sequence of analysis of the results \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Basis for the parametric study \n\n  75 \n\nChapter 5 Basis for the parametric study \n\n5.1 Characteristics of the analysed plate girders \n\nThe main objective of the parametric study is to evaluate the accuracy of the design \n\nexpressions implemented in EC3 to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate \n\ngirders affected by shear buckling, which includes the web resistance to shear buckling, \n\nthe flanges contribution and the interaction between shear and bending. With this \n\npurpose, four groups of simply supported steel plate girders have been analysed. Steel \n\nplate girders with rigid and non-rigid end posts have been considered, while steel plate \n\ngirders with no end posts were not considered because they are affected by web \n\ncrippling, which is out of the scope of this thesis. \n\nThe first group was designed to assess the accuracy of the expressions used to obtain the \n\ncontribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance. Simply supported 2-\n\npanels plate girders were considered (see Figure 5.1). The girders were provided with \n\ndouble-sided transverse stiffeners at load points (supports and mid-span). The web \n\nthickness was fixed (tw=4 mm) and the flanges thickness was ranged between 12 and \n\n20 mm. For the web depth, values between 800 and 1600 mm were considered. The \n\ngirder length was chosen to achieve the desired aspect ratios (a/hw), which varied from \n\n0.5 up to 3.0. Thus, the girder length, which is twice the transverse stiffeners spacing, \n\nranged between 0.8 and 9.6 m. Table 5.1 shows the geometrical dimensions considered \n\nfor the girders analysed in group I, which are illustrated in Figure 5.2a.  \n\nThe properties of the second group of plate girders were quite similar to group I. Figure \n\n5.1a shows de geometry of the plate girders with non-rigid end posts, whereas the \n\ngeometry of the plate girders with rigid end posts is presented in Figure 5.1b. The \n\ndifferences between group I and II are related to the web and flanges thicknesses. With \n\nthis group of girders it was intended to analyse the shear buckling resistance. For that \n\npurpose, the plate girders were provided with strong flanges (tf=20 mm) in order to have \n\na shear dominant failure in almost all of the girders. The web thickness was ranged \n\nbetween 4 and 10 mm, as presented in Table 5.2. For an easier understanding, Figure \n\n5.2b shows the cross-section of the girders belonging to group II. \n\nRegarding material properties, the steel grade S235 was considered for groups I and II \n\nand the Young\u2019s modulus at normal temperature was considered equal to 210 GPa. \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n76 \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Details of the plate girders analysed in group I \n\nhw \n\n[mm] \n\ntw \n\n[mm] \n\nbf \n\n[mm] \n\ntf \n\n[mm] \n\nts \n\n[mm] \n\na/hw \n\n[-] \n\n800, 1000, \n\n1200, 1400 \n\nand 1600 \n\n4.0 300 \n\n12.0, 14.0, \n\n16.0, 18.0 \n\nand 20.0 \n\n20.0 \n\n0.5, 1.0,  \n\n1.5, 2.0  \n\nand 3.0 \n\n \n\nTable 5.2 \u2013 Details of the plate girders analysed in group II \n\nhw \n\n[mm] \n\ntw \n\n[mm] \n\nbf \n\n[mm] \n\ntf \n\n[mm] \n\nts \n\n[mm] \n\na/hw \n\n[-] \n\n800, 1000, \n\n1200, 1400 \n\nand 1600 \n\n4.0, 5.0, 6.0,  \n\n7.0, 8.0, 9.0  \n\nand 10.0 \n\n300 20.0 20.0 \n\n0.5, 1.0,  \n\n1.5, 2.0  \n\nand 3.0 \n\n \n\n \n\na) non-rigid end posts \n\n \n\nb) rigid end posts \n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Geometric configuration of the plate girders analysed in groups I and II \n\na200 mm\n\nhw\n20 mm 4 mm\n\ntf\n\nP\n\n300 mm\n\na 200 mm\n\na200 mm\n\nhw\n20 mm 4 mm\n\ntf\n\nP\n\n300 mm\n\na 200 mm\n\na200 mm\n\nhw\n20 mm 4 mm\n\ntf\n\nP\n\n300 mm\n\na 200 mm\n\na200 mm\n\nhw\n20 mm 4 mm\n\ntf\n\nP\n\n300 mm\n\na 200 mm\n\n\n\nChapter 5. Basis for the parametric study \n\n  77 \n\nIn the third group of this parametric study, it was intended to study 4-panels and 6-\n\npanels plate girders in addition to the 2-panels plate girders analysed in the two first \n\ngroups. Simply supported plate girders with rigid and non-rigid end posts were \n\nconsidered. The rigid end post was formed by two stiffeners placed at the end supports \n\nspaced by 100 mm. The thickness of these end stiffeners is the same as the intermediate \n\ntransverse stiffeners. Figure 5.3 shows the geometric configuration of the girders with \n\nrigid end posts. The geometric configuration of the girders with non-rigid end posts is \n\nthe same presented in Figure 5.3, if removed the two end stiffeners (one in each side of \n\nthe girder). The girder length was 1.8 m and different distances between transverse \n\nstiffeners were considered (300, 450, 600 and 900 mm), as presented in Figure 5.3.  \n\nNine different cross-sections were analysed, as presented in Table 5.3. Three web \n\ndepths (300, 600 and 900 mm), as well as three flange widths (100, 200 and 300 mm) \n\nwere considered, as illustrated in Figure 5.2c. This way, a wide range of plate girders \n\naspect ratios were analysed, ranging from 0.3 up to 3.0. Finally, different steel grades \n\nwere considered (S235, S275, S355 and S460). \n\nThe fourth and last group of plate girders analysed in this parametric study was based \n\non the plate girders tested in group III. Herein, the main objective was the assessment of \n\nthe interaction between shear and bending. With this purpose, the thickness of the \n\nflanges was reduced to allow more girders exhibiting a combined shear plus bending \n\nfailure.

Geometric imperfections and residual stresses were taken into \n\naccount at both normal and elevated temperatures, as detailed in section 4.1.3.  \n\nFor the simulations at elevated temperatures a uniform temperature distribution in the \n\ncross-section was used, so that the comparison between the numerical results and the \n\nEC3 simple design expressions could be possible. The temperatures chosen were 350, \n\n500, 600 \u00baC, in order to cover the majority of practical situations. These temperatures \n\nwere applied under steady-state conditions, i.e. the temperature is considered constant \n\nwhile the load is increased until failure. \n\nThe number of numerical simulations executed in this parametric study for each group \n\nof plate girders is presented in Table 5.6. As one can see, 1176 numerical simulations \n\nwere conducted at normal temperature, while 3528 numerical simulations were \n\nperformed at elevated temperatures, amounting to 4704 numerical simulations.

With this purpose, three different zones were considered in the V-M \n\ninteraction diagram for the analysis and comparison of the numerical results with the \n\nEC3 expressions, as illustrated in Figure 5.4. Hence, plate girders exhibiting a shear \n\ndominant failure belong to zone 1, while plate girders revealing a bending dominant \n\nfailure belong to zone 3. Finally, plate girders with a combined shear plus bending \n\nfailure belong to zone 2. The ratio of shear force to bending moment for each zone of \n\nthe shear-bending interaction diagram is given in Table 5.7. \n\n\n\nChapter 5.

For evaluating the design rules \n\nadopted in EC3, a proportional loading is assumed, i.e. the ratio of shear force to \n\nbending moment remains constant. The numerical results collected from zone 1 are used \n\nto assess the shear buckling resistance predictions from EC3 given by Eq. (3.1), while \n\nthe numerical results collected from zone 2 are used to evaluate the shear-bending \n\ninteraction design expression (Eq. (3.17)).

(in Figure 5.4, ? = ???? ?? ???? ??? ). A value of ? larger than 1.0 \n\nmeans a safe result and the numerical data point is positioned outside the interaction \n\ndiagram. This methodology follows the one established by Saliba et al. (2014). It is \n\nimportant having in mind that the length of the zone 2 curve is smaller in the case of \n\nsections with Class 3 or 4, since the curve should be truncated by the vertical line that \n\ncuts the horizontal axis in ??,??, as explained in section 3.3. \n\nFurthermore, in the EC3 design curve for the reduction of the web resistance when \n\nsubjected to shear buckling, ? = 1.0 was used instead of the EC3 recommended value \n\n? = 1.2, since the applied material model does not take into account the increase of \n\n20% of the shear yield strength due to strain hardening (Beg et al., 2010). \n\n5.3 Sequence of analysis of the results \n\nThe analysis of the results obtained in the parametric study follows a logic sequence. As \n\na starting point, the values of the distance ?, which defines the position of the plastic \n\nhinges, obtained by both numerical results from SAFIR and analytical expression from \n\nEC3 (Eq. (3.12)) were compared in Chapter 6 considering the group I of plate girders. \n\nResults derived from this comparison demonstrated that the accuracy given by the EC3 \n\nanalytical expression to calculate the position of the plastic hinges in steel plate girders \n\nshould be improved. Thus, the application of a ? corrective coefficient to the analytical \n\nexpression to determine the distance ? was proposed.  \n\nHaving improved the ability of this design expression, the consequent analytical \n\nformula to obtain the flange contribution to shear buckling resistance (Eq. (3.11)) has \n\nbeen assessed, considering different values for c: the one obtained using the unchanged \n\nEC3 expression and the one obtained applying the ? coefficient. The accuracy of \n\nEq. (3.12) increases significantly when the ? corrective coefficient is applied. \n\nAfterwards, in Chapter 7 the ultimate shear strength given by the numerical model was \n\ncompared to the one predicted by EC3 through Eq. (3.1). After analysing the ultimate \n\nshear strength as a whole, the web contribution in the full resistance of a plate girder \n\nwas evaluated. For comparison with EC3 analytical expressions, the contribution from \n\nthe web numerically obtained (??,????? ) is calculated by Eq. (5.1) subtracting the \n\n\n\nChapter 5. Basis for the parametric study \n\n  83 \n\nflange contribution (?? ), obtained using Eq. (3.14), from the ultimate shear strength \n\ndirectly predicted by the numerical model.

Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance \n\n  87 \n\nChapter 6 Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance \n\n6.1 General considerations \n\nThe main goal of this Chapter is to evaluate the accuracy of the design expressions to \n\npredict the contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance. However, the \n\nEC3 predictions cannot be directly compared with numerical results, since it is not \n\npossible to numerically obtain the contribution from the flanges alone. The ultimate \n\nresistance given by the numerical model is the full resistance including the web \n\nresistance and the contribution from the flanges.  \n\nHence, the methodology used to assess the flanges contribution to shear buckling \n\nresistance was based on the analysis of sets of five girders, maintaining the web \n\nproperties and ranging the thickness of the flanges from 12 to 20 mm (see Figure 6.1). \n\nThus, the increase of strength numerically obtained, caused by an increase of 2 mm on \n\nthe flanges thickness, could be compared with the increase of strength given by the EC3 \n\npredictions. It allowed evaluating the accuracy of the EC3 predictions for the flanges \n\ncontribution to shear buckling resistance. \n\nIn this Chapter the plate girders from group I were analysed. The characteristics of this \n\ngroup of girders were presented in Chapter 5. For the analysis of the numerical results, \n\nthe procedure presented in Figure 6.2 was followed. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 \u2013 Schematic representation of plate girders (group I) considered in this Chapter \n\nRigid and non-rigid end posts\n\n1200\n\nhw (mm)\n\n1000\n\n161412 2018\n\ntf (mm)\n\n0.5 1.0 3.01.5 2.0\n\na/hw\n\n800 16001400\n\n(\u2026) (\u2026) (\u2026) (\u2026) \n\n(\u2026) (\u2026) (\u2026) (\u2026) \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n88 \n\nNumerical tests with SAFIR \n\nDirect results: \n\n?

(3.11), the contribution from the flanges to the shear buckling \n\nresistance of a steel plate girder depends on the dimensions of the flanges, the steel yield \n\nstrength, the design bending moment considering the effective area of the flanges, the \n\nlargest moment within the panel and the distance ?, which is the distance between \n\nplastic hinges that forms in flanges (see Figure 6.3).  \n\nAccording to Johansson et al. (2007), the values of ? given by the EC3 expression \n\n(Eq. (3.12)) are usually smaller than the values observed in the tests, being justified with \n\nthe fact that in reality there is always an additional support from the web and the plastic \n\n\n\nChapter 6. Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance \n\n  89 \n\nmechanism in the flanges cannot develop freely. Therefore, the web and flanges \n\ncontributions to shear buckling resistance cannot be completely separated. Tests \n\nconducted by Rockey and Skaloud (1969) and Skaloud (1971) showed that the values of \n\n? varies between 0.16 and 0.75 times the length of the panel (?). Figure 6.4 shows the \n\nratio ? ??  for the analysed plate girders. Indeed, the values of ? numerically obtained \n\nvaries between 0.08 and 0.80, limits quite closer to those observed by Rockey and \n\nSkaloud (1969) and Skaloud (1971), which are represented by the dashed lines in Figure \n\n6.4. However, this is not observed for the values of ? predicted by the EC3 expression, \n\nwhere the ratio ? ??  ranges between 0.26 and 0.33. Hence, with the numerical analysis \n\nof the distance ?, it is clear the need to improve the accuracy of the expression adopted \n\nin EC3 for prediction of the distance between plastic hinges. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3 \u2013 Illustration of the distance c \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4 \u2013 Ratio c/a for the analysed plate girders \n\nc\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\n\nc\n/a\n\n[-\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter       [-]\n\n20\u00baC \n\nc EC3 / a\n\nc SAFIR / a\n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n90 \n\n6.3 Proposal of a corrective coefficient for the EC3 expression to \n\npredict the distance between plastic hinges \n\nFigure 6.4 has showed that the value of the distance ? predicted by EC3 through \n\nEq. (3.12) is smaller than the one numerically obtained for plate girders with ???? &lt;3. \n\nThus, it was demonstrated that Eq. (3.11) adopted in EC3 overestimates the contribution \n\nfrom the flanges to shear buckling resistance for ???? &lt;3. Consequently, it is proposed \n\nan improvement on the expression implemented in EC3 to predict the distance ?. The \n\nnew ?, called by ?????????, is obtained applying a ? corrective coefficient to the original \n\nexpression, as presented in Eq. (6.1). This ? coefficient depends on the web slenderness \n\nparameter and it is defined by Eq. (6.2) at normal temperature. For simplification, it is \n\nonly proposed the introduction of a ? coefficient, not developing the respective \n\nexpression to determine ?. \n\nEC3 says nothing about the determination of the distance ? at elevated temperatures and \n\nit was observed that the values of ? obtained in the numerical analyses at elevated \n\ntemperatures were different of those obtained at normal temperature. Therefore, a \n\ndifferent ? coefficient, called by ??, was proposed to improve the results given by \n\nEq. (3.12) at elevated temperatures. ?? is defined by Eq. (6.3). \n\nThe ratio between the values of ? obtained from both numerical model and EC3 \n\nexpression is presented in function of the slenderness parameter of the web in Figure \n\n6.5a for normal temperature and in Figure 6.5b for elevated temperatures. The bold \n\nblack line represents the proposed coefficient. As one can see, the application of this \n\ncoefficient to the distance ? predicted by EC3 fits better the values of the numerically \n\nobtained ?. Moreover, ? was considered equal to 1.0 for the plate girders with a web \n\nslenderness parameter at normal temperature (????) larger than 3.0. At elevated \n\ntemperatures, ?? = 1.0 for ????,? ? 3.5. This was because for those plate girders the \n\ndistance ? predicted by EC3 is generally conservative, i.e. higher than the distance ? \n\nnumerically observed. \n\n????????? = ? ? = ? ?

Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance \n\n  93 \n\nThe resistance from the web to shear buckling predicted by EC3 was also compared \n\nwith the one numerically obtained through the Eq. (5.1), as explained previously. The \n\nweb contribution was calculated subtracting the flange contribution to the ultimate shear \n\ncapacity given by the numerical model, considering both the original expression to \n\ndetermine the distance ? and the modified expression by the application of the ? \n\ncorrective coefficient.  \n\nSo, if the contribution from the flanges given by Eq. (3.11) was correct, all girders of \n\neach group of five would have different values of ??  but similar values of ??,?????. \n\nHowever, big variations on ??,????? were observed when the original EC3 expression to \n\ndetermine the distance ? is applied, showing that the EC3 expression to predict the \n\ncontribution from the flanges to the shear buckling resistance is not giving accurate \n\nresults. The results used in the analysis of the web resistance to shear buckling at \n\nnormal temperature are presented in Table 6.1. The average ??,????? for each group of \n\nfive girders with the same web slenderness parameter is listed in Table 6.1, as well as \n\nthe standard deviation and the maximum and minimum values. In order to facilitate the \n\nanalysis, both average and standard deviation are also plotted in Figure 6.7.  \n\nAs one can see, the standard deviation obtained using the distance ? given by EC3 is too \n\nhigh, mainly for plate girders with web slenderness parameter lower than 2.0. It \n\ndemonstrates that the EC3 expression to predict the flanges contribution was not \n\nproviding consistent results and it needed to be improved. Figure 6.7 shows that the \n\nintroduction of a new ?, called by ?????????, allowed to reduce significantly the \n\nstandard deviation of the results.  \n\nLooking carefully, it is possible to observe that the results from Figure 6.6 are reflected \n\nin Figure 6.7, i.e. the same tendency on safe and unsafe results is observed when \n\nanalysing the full resistance of the girders (Figure 6.6) or the web resistance only \n\n(Figure 6.7). It means that the expression to predict the flanges contribution is providing \n\nmore accurate results when the factor ????????? is used.

Contribution from the flanges to the shear resistance \n\n  97 \n\nUsing the methodology presented in Chapter 5, in the web resistance given by the \n\nnumerical model (??,?????) is compared to the one predicted by the EC3 expressions \n\nadapted to fire situation by the application of the reduction factors of the steel \n\nmechanical properties at elevated temperatures. Similar tables to Table 6.1 have been \n\nbuilt for 350\u00baC, 500\u00baC and 600\u00baC. The results for 500\u00baC are presented in Figure 6.9.  \n\nAs explained before, ??,????? should be the same for all girders with same web \n\nproperties. However, Figure 6.9 shows that the standard deviation of ??,????? is high \n\nwhen the distance ? predicted by EC3 is considered, mainly for plate girders with web \n\nslenderness parameter at elevated temperatures lower than 2.5. It is showed that \n\nexpression should be improved. For that purpose, a corrective coefficient (??) was \n\nproposed and its consideration causes an improvement on the EC3 predictions for the \n\ncontribution from the flanges to shear buckling resistance. As one can see in Figure 6.9, \n\nthe standard deviation when ?? is considered (green points) is lower when compared to \n\nthe values obtained using the original EC3 expression. It demonstrates that Eq. (3.11) \n\ngives more accurate predictions when ?? is considered.  \n\nMoreover, it was observed an increase on ??,????? when the proposed distance ? is \n\nconsidered. It is because the EC3 predictions overestimate the contribution from the \n\nflanges to shear buckling (?? ), which influences the web resistance numerically \n\nobtained using Eq. (5.1). When ?? is applied, the distance ? is higher, so the \n\ncontribution from the flanges predicted by EC3 is lower. Consequently, a lower ??  is \n\nsubtracted in Eq. (5.1) conducting to a higher ??,?????.  \n\nFigure 6.9 also indicates that the EC3 design curve for the web contribution to shear \n\nbuckling is not fitting the numerical results and must be improved. With this in mind, \n\nnew expressions to predict the web resistance to shear buckling at elevated temperatures \n\nare proposed in Chapter 7 taken into account all the steel plate girders analysed in the \n\nparametric numerical study. \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n98 \n\n \n\na) \n\n \n\nb) \n\nFigure 6.9 \u2013 Web resistance to shear buckling of group I plate girders at 500\u00baC \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\n\nM\ne\na\n\nn\n r\n\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\n\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n,?\n\n[-\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter          [-]\n\n500\u00baC - Non-rigid end posts\n\nEC3 curve\n\nusing c EC3\n\nusing c proposed\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\n\nM\ne\na\n\nn\n r\n\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\n\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n,?\n\n[-\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter          [-]\n\n500\u00baC - Rigid end posts\n\nEC3 curve\n\nusing c EC3\n\nusing c proposed\n\n\n\nChapter 6.

Shear buckling resistance \n\n  103 \n\nChapter 7 Shear buckling resistance \n\n7.1 Failure mechanism \n\nThe resistance of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling is currently based on \n\npost-critical design methods. Many different models have been developed to illustrate \n\nthe post buckling behaviour and predict the ultimate shear strength of these structural \n\nelements, as presented in Chapter 2.  \n\nThere has been a constant controversy among researchers in an attempt to adequately \n\nexplain the physical post-buckling behaviour of web panels. In fact, the interaction \n\nbetween the non-linear shear stress and normal stress that develops from the beginning \n\nof the shear buckling state until the ultimate strength state is quite complex. The fact \n\nthat more than ten theories have been developed to explain this phenomenon makes \n\nclear the complexity of the tension field action. This may probably be the largest \n\nnumber of failure theories dedicated to a single topic in structural mechanics. \n\nThe Rotated Stress Field Method was implemented in EC3 (CEN, 2006b) for the design \n\nof plated structural elements subjected to shear buckling and so it has been taken as the \n\nbasis of this thesis. As described before, it assumes a pure shear stress state in the web \n\npanel preceding buckling and the development of a tension field after buckling. The \n\ncollapse mechanism is characterized by the formation of plastic hinges in the flanges.  \n\nDuring the analysis of results of the parametric numerical study, the failure mechanism \n\nassumed by the Rotated Stress Field Method has been frequently observed in the plate \n\ngirders with a shear dominant failure. Consequently, it is described here using, as an \n\nexample, the 2-panel plate girder with the following characteristics: hw=1000 mm; \n\ntw=4 mm; bf=300 mm; tf=20 mm; ts=20 mm; a/hw=2.0; L=4000 mm; S235.  \n\nFigure 7.1 illustrates the principal stresses distribution developed at the moment of \n\ncollapse for both rigid and non-rigid end posts. The tension field development can be \n\nclearly seen. Moreover, it is possible to observe that in the plate girder with non-rigid \n\nend posts this tension field is anchored almost exclusively on the flanges. On the other \n\nhand, in the plate girder with rigid end posts the anchorage of the tension field is shared \n\nbetween the flanges and the end post. Nevertheless, the tension field amplitude is higher \n\nin the girder with rigid end posts when compared to the girder with non-rigid end posts. \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n104 \n\nFigure 7.2 shows the mechanism of collapse involving the formation of plastic hinges in \n\nthe flanges. As one can see, the formation of plastic hinges is visible in both plate \n\ngirders irrespective of the type of end supports. However, it is more pronounced in the \n\ngirder with rigid end posts. \n\n \n\na) non-rigid end posts \n\n \n\nb) rigid end posts \n\nFigure 7.1 \u2013 Tension field development at normal temperature (blue \u2013 compression; red \u2013 tension) \n\n \n\n \n\na) non-rigid end posts \n\n \n\nb) rigid end posts \n\nFigure 7.2 \u2013 Failure mechanism at normal temperature \n\n\n\nChapter 7. Shear buckling resistance \n\n  105 \n\nThe evolution of the distribution of principal stresses after buckling until the moment of \n\ncollapse is presented in Figure 7.3 for the plate girder with rigid end posts above \n\nmentioned. As one can see, after buckling the principal tensile stresses start increasing \n\nsymmetrically since the two panels have the same dimensions. At the moment of \n\ncollapse, plastic hinges forms in the flanges while the out-of-plane web buckling \n\nincreases substantially in the panel where the failure mechanism occurs, as may be seen \n\nin Figure 7.4c.  \n\nThe maximum web out-of-plane displacement registered at the beginning of the \n\nnumerical simulation is 3.8 mm, as shown in Figure 7.4a. The initial web out-of-plane \n\ndisplacements are due the initial geometric imperfections. Afterwards, the maximum \n\nweb out-of-plane displacement increases progressively up to 16.4 mm in the post-\n\nbuckling stage (see Figure 7.4a). Finally, when collapse occurs, the right web panel \n\nbuckle considerably (see Figure 7.4c) with the out-of-plane displacement suddenly \n\nincreases up to 91.5 mm. \n\n \n\n  \n\na) P=105 kN b) P=168 kN \n\n  \n\nc) P=231 kN d) P=315 kN \n\n  \n\ne) P=420 kN f) P=503 kN \n\n  \n\ng) P=540 kN h) P=545 kN \n\nFigure 7.3 \u2013 Evolution of principal stresses distribution until failure in a steel plate girder tested at \n\nnormal temperature (blue \u2013 compression; red \u2013 tension) \n\n \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n106 \n\n \na) pre-buckling stage \n\n \nb) post-buckling stage \n\n \nc) ultimate stage \n\nFigure 7.4 \u2013 Color scale of the out-of-plane web displacements in a steel plate girder tested at \n\nnormal temperature \n\nThe failure mechanism at elevated temperatures of the analysed plate girders affected by \n\nshear buckling is quite similar to the one observed at 20\u00baC, involving the development \n\nof the tension field in the web and the formation of plastic hinges in the flanges. To \n\nexemplify, it is presented here for the girders analysed above subjected to 500\u00baC.  \n\nFigure 7.5 demonstrates the tension field development at the moment of collapse for \n\nboth rigid and non-rigid end posts. As it happened at normal temperature, the tension \n\nfield is anchored almost exclusively on the flanges for the girder with non-rigid end \n\nposts. In the girder with rigid end posts, these rigid end posts contribute to the \n\nanchorage of the tension field. In this plate girder the tension field covers almost the \n\nentire web panel. \n\nFigure 7.6 shows the appearance of plastic hinges in the flanges at the moment of \n\ncollapse in both plate girders. In contrast to what was observed at normal temperature, \n\nthe differences between the girders with non-rigid and rigid end posts on the web buckle \n\nand on the distance between the plastic hinges in the flanges are not so pronounced. \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

The results are divided into \n\nthree different zones in function of the type of failure, as explained in section 5.2.  \n\nConcerning the results obtained at normal temperature, Figure 7.7 demonstrates that \n\nEC3 is providing safe predictions for almost all the girders belonging to zones 2 and 3. \n\nHowever, for the girders exhibiting a shear dominant failure (zone 1), the ultimate shear \n\nstrength predicted by EC3 is not on the safe side for a considerable part of the analysed \n\ngirders, particularly for those with the smaller values of slenderness parameter. On the \n\nother, for the girders with the higher values of slenderness parameter, the EC3 \n\npredictions are frequently too conservative.  \n\nAs regards the girders tested at elevated temperatures, the analytical results are on the \n\nsafe side for almost all of the girders exhibiting a bending dominant failure (zone 3). \n\nHowever, the EC3 expressions, adapted to fire design by the application of the \n\nreduction factors (see section 3.5),  are proving unsafe predictions for a large portion of \n\nthe girders where shear has an important role on the failure (zones 1 and 2).  \n\nIt makes clear the need to improve the EC3 expressions, for both normal and fire \n\ndesign, in order to provide safe predictions for all steel plate girders irrespective of their \n\nweb slenderness parameter. \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

Actually, it was previously observed in Chapter \n\n6 that the expression implemented in EC3 for the flanges contribution to shear buckling \n\nresistance was not giving accurate results, being proposed a corrective coefficient (?), \n\nwhich is detailed in section 6.3 of this document.  \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\n\nU\n [\n\n-]\n\nSlenderness parameter       [-]\n\n20\u00baC\n\nZone 1\n\nZone 2\n\nZone 3\n\nUNSAFE\n\nSAFE\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\n\nU\n [\n\n-]\n\nSlenderness parameter          [-]\n\n350\u00baC, 500\u00baC and 600\u00baC\n\nZone 1\n\nZone 2\n\nZone 3\n\nSAFE\n\nUNSAFE\n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n110 \n\nFigure 7.9 demonstrates the improvements resulting from the application of this \n\ncoefficient at normal temperature, mainly for the plate girders with web slenderness \n\nparameter between 1.0 and 2.5. However, for the plate girders with web slenderness \n\nparameter lower than 1.3, unsafe results are still there. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate \n\ndesign expressions for the resistance from the web to shear buckling.  \n\nFigure 7.10 illustrates the comparison between the numerical results and the EC3 design \n\ncurve for all plate girders exhibiting a shear dominant failure (zone 1). It is also possible \n\nto observe the improvements caused by the application of the corrective coefficient ?. It \n\nis important to having in mind that, for comparison with EC3 design curve, the \n\ncontribution from the web numerically obtained was calculated by Eq. (5.1) subtracting \n\nthe flange contribution (?? ) from the ultimate shear strength directly predicted by the \n\nnumerical model. Additionally, it is important to note that the EC3 design curve is \n\nplotted in Figure 7.10 using the values from Table 3.1, depending on the end posts.  \n\nWhen analysing the effect of the corrective coefficient for the contribution from the \n\nflanges to shear buckling, Figure 7.10 shows that its application causes an improvement \n\non the EC3 predictions, for both rigid and non-rigid end posts. On the one hand, the \n\ndispersion of results is considerably lower. On the other hand, EC3 predictions are safer \n\nwhen this coefficient is applied, since the original EC3 expression overestimates the \n\nflanges contribution to shear buckling, as it was observed in Chapter 6. \n\nRegarding the results of the girders with non-rigid end posts, Figure 7.10a shows that \n\nthe EC3 design curve does not fit the numerical results. For the girders with web \n\nslenderness parameter lower than 1.30, EC3 overestimates the resistance from the web \n\nto shear buckling. Furthermore, for the girders with high values of web slenderness \n\nparameter, EC3 underestimates the web resistance. It evidences the need to adjust the \n\nEC3 design curve and a proposal will be made in the next section of this document.  \n\nConcerning plate girders with rigid end posts, Figure 7.10b demonstrates a better \n\nagreement between the numerical results and the EC3 design curve. However, it still \n\nneeds to be improved for girders with low values of web slenderness parameter. \n\nModifications to the current EC3 design curve will also be proposed. \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

As it has been made for normal \n\ntemperature, a corrective coefficient (??) was proposed to improve the accuracy of the \n\nEC3 expression used to predict the contribution from the flanges to shear buckling. \n\nFigure 7.11 shows the improvements obtained just by the application of ?? to the \n\nexpression to determine the distance ? on the calculation of the contribution from the \n\nflanges to shear buckling resistance. However, it is visible that the application of ?? is \n\nnot enough because there are still a lot of unsafe results. Consequently, it is important to \n\nevaluate the accuracy of the EC3 expressions used to determine the web resistance to \n\nshear buckling. \n\nThe shear buckling resistance of the web predicted by EC3 is compared with the \n\nnumerical resistance in Figure 7.12. Figure 7.12a presents this comparison for the \n\ngirders with non-rigid end posts. As one can see, despite the improvements given by the \n\nintroduction of ??, the EC3 design curve should be improved for fire design, mainly for \n\nthe girders with web slenderness parameter lower than 2.7. The same behaviour may be \n\nobserved for the girders with rigid end posts. Figure 7.12b shows that the lowest the \n\nweb slenderness parameter in fire situation is, the highest the unsafe portion of the \n\nnumerical results is.  \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\n\nR\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\n\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n[-\n\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter       [-]\n\n20\u00baC - Rigid end posts\n\nConsidering Xf according to EC3\n\nConsidering Xf according to EC3 but affected by B\n\n\n\nChapter 7.

As an example, \n\nthe results of the girders with hw=1000 mm are presented in Figure 7.13 and Figure \n\n7.14, for 20\u00baC and 500\u00baC, respectively. In the charts below, \u201cNREP\u201d means non-rigid \n\nend posts, while \u201cREP\u201d means rigid end posts. Trend lines were used for SAFIR results \n\nin order to facilitate the comparison with EC3 results. \n\nWith respect to the nature of the EC3 predictions in terms of the aspect ratio of the \n\ngirders, it was observed that the most unsafe predictions are clearly those for girders \n\nwith a/hw=0.5, at both normal and elevated temperatures.  \n\nFigure 7.15 demonstrates that the safe nature of the EC3 predictions at 20\u00baC varies with \n\nthe ratio tf/tw. The highest the ratio tf/tw is, the highest the safe nature of EC3 predictions \n\nis.

Shear buckling resistance \n\n  119 \n\nThe statistical analysis performed in section 7.4 will allow evaluating the influence of \n\nthese parameters with more detail, but taking into account the modifications to the EC3 \n\ndesign procedure presented over in this thesis, which may lead to conclusions somewhat \n\ndifferent of those presented here. For instance, with the current EC3 design expressions \n\nthe most unsafe predictions correspond to the girders with the lowest aspect ratios. \n\nHowever, if the reduction factor for the web resistance to shear buckling proposed in \n\nnext section is considered, these girders will have the most safe predictions. \n\n7.3 Proposal of new design expressions \n\nOn the basis of the numerical investigation presented and discussed in Chapter 6 and \n\nChapter 7 of this document, a proposal of new expressions to predict the ultimate shear \n\nstrength of steel plated structural elements is presented. This proposal follows the EC3 \n\nprinciples, using all design rules presented in Chapter 3, only modifying two steps on \n\nthe calculation of the shear resistance of a steel plate girder subjected to shear buckling.  \n\nOne concerns to the application of the corrective coefficient, already presented in \n\nsection 6.3, on the determination of the distance c needed for the calculation of the \n\ncontribution from the flanges to shear buckling resistance. The other modification on \n\nthe EC3 procedure consists in using a different reduction factor for the web contribution \n\nto shear buckling resistance. Instead of the reduction factor presented in Table 3.1, the \n\nreduction factor presented in Table 7.1 should be used for the design at 20\u00baC, while the \n\nreduction factor given by Table 7.2 should be used for fire design. It is important to note \n\nthat considering these proposals, the shear buckling resistance must be checked only \n\nwhen the following conditions are satisfied (instead of those presented in section 3.2): \n\n?

The design curve at normal temperature for the girders with non-rigid end posts \n\nis presented in Figure 7.17a, while the design curve for girders with rigid end posts is \n\npresented in Figure 7.17b. It is visible that the proposed curves fit much better the \n\nnumerical results. For the girders with non-rigid end posts, the design curve was \n\nreadjusted for both the girders with ???? &lt;1.32 where the EC3 design curve was \n\noverestimating the web resistance and the girders with ???? ? 1.32 where the EC3 design \n\ncurve was underestimating the web resistance. Regarding the girders with rigid end \n\nposts, the new proposal only modifies the overestimated EC3 predictions (???? &lt;1.32).  \n\nConcerning the proposed design curves for elevated temperatures, they are plotted in \n\nFigure 7.18. The range of unsafe results was quite large and the main goal of these new \n\ncurves was to stop the overestimations given by the EC3, even though that there are \n\nsome cases where the EC3 predictions will be very conservative, since the dispersion of \n\nresults is larger at elevated temperatures when compared to normal temperature. \n\nThe improvements obtained by the proposed design curves for the determination of the \n\nultimate shear strength of steel plate girders are presented in Figure 7.19 and Figure \n\n7.20, for normal and elevated temperatures, respectively. These Figures may be \n\ncompared with Figure 7.7 and Figure 7.8, where the proposals were not considered. As \n\nit can be seen, the EC3 procedure is providing safe predictions for almost all the \n\nanalysed girders when these proposals are considered. The exceptions are the girders \n\nwith very small web slenderness that are not very common in practice. Nevertheless, the \n\nunsafe differences are small and acceptable. \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

A statistical analysis of the utilisation ratio values \n\nis presented here in order to understand the accuracy of the EC3 expressions and the \n\nimprovements introduced by the application of the proposals presented before. \n\nTable 7.3 presents such analysis for the results obtained at normal temperature. Results \n\nfrom different zones of the shear-bending interaction diagram (see Figure 5.4) are \n\nseparately evaluated. Zone 1 comprises the results from the girders with a shear \n\ndominant failure, which are used to assess the expressions to predict the shear buckling \n\nresistance. Zone 2 contains the results from the girders with a combined shear plus \n\nbending failure, which are used to evaluate the expression for the interaction between \n\nshear and bending. Finally, the results from the girders with a bending dominant failure \n\nare included in zone 3. Furthermore, two design approaches were considered in the \n\nstatistical analysis. One, called EC3 in the tables below, where the numerical results are \n\ncompared with the analytical results provided by the unchanged EC3 expressions, and \n\nother (called EC3+P) where the results given by SAFIR are compared with the EC3 \n\nexpressions modified by the proposals presented in this thesis. A similar analysis is \n\npresented in Table 7.4 for the results obtained at elevated temperatures. \n\n \nTable 7.3 \u2013 Statistical analysis at normal temperature \n\nZone D. A.

Shear buckling resistance \n\n  125 \n\nA quick analysis allows concluding that the application of the proposals presented in \n\nthis thesis induces significant improvements on the EC3 predictions at both normal and \n\nelevated temperatures. The application of ? to the expression to determine the distance \n\nbetween plastic hinges that forms in the flanges improves the EC3 predictions for the \n\nflanges contribution to shear buckling (???,??), which are reflected in the zone 1 results. \n\nOn the other hand, the application of the new reduction factors for the web contribution \n\nto shear buckling (??) improves the EC3 predictions for the web resistance (???,??), \n\nwhich affects the results from the zones 1 and 2. Finally, the improvements in zone 3 \n\nresults are due to a different zone classification of the utilisation ratios when the \n\nproposed ???,?? is used, since the boundaries of each zone are obtained using ???,?? \n\n(see Table 5.7). When analysing Table 7.4, a decrease on the number of girders with a \n\nbending dominant failure from 413 to 95 may be observed when the proposals are taken \n\ninto account. It causes an increase on the percentage of safe results since some girders \n\nwere classified as failing by bending and actually they fail before, due to the interaction \n\nbetween shear and bending, not reaching the resistance moment of the cross-section. \n\nHence, considering the zones classification where the proposals are taken into account, \n\nat normal temperature the failure was caused by shear in 78.3% of the analysed plate \n\ngirders (zone 1), while a combined shear plus bending failure was observed in 19.8% \n\n(zone 2) and a bending dominant failure only happened in 1.9 % (zone 3). As regards \n\nthe girders analysed at elevated temperatures, a shear dominant failure (zone 1) was \n\nobserved in 2701 girders (76.6%), a combined shear plus bending failure (zone 2) was \n\nregistered in 732 (20.7%) and, finally, the failure of 95 (2.7%) of the analysed girders \n\nwas caused by bending (zone 3). In comparison with the results obtained at normal \n\ntemperature, a slight decrease on the shear dominant failures was observed, while the \n\nnumber of failures caused by bending or by the interaction between shear and bending \n\nhas grown.  \n\nConcerning the results at normal temperature, Table 7.3 shows that both design \n\napproaches provide, on average, safe results since the average utilisation ratio is higher \n\nthan 1.0. On the other hand, for the design approach considering the unchanged EC3 \n\nexpressions, a larger deviation from the average is evident when compared to the design \n\napproach where the proposals presented in this document are taken into account. The \n\nresults given by the unchanged EC3 procedure do not satisfy two of the three validation \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n126 \n\ncriteria presented by CEN TC 250 (1999). Indeed, for the zone 1 plate girders, the \n\nultimate shear strength predicted by EC3 is not on the safe side for almost 25% of the \n\nanalysed girders, of which about 14% with an utilisation ratio lower than 0.95. This \n\npercentage of 25% of results on the unsafe side is larger than the maximum of 20 % \n\nrecommended by CEN TC 250 (1999). Furthermore, CEN TC 250 (1999) also refers \n\nthat the calculation result shall not be on the unsafe side by more than 15%. This is not \n\nsatisfied by the EC3 procedure, since the maximum unsafe result is 0.79 (21%). When \n\nthe proposals are considered, it is observed a substantial decrease on the standard \n\ndeviation from 0.15 to 0.07, as well as a reduction on the percentage of unsafe results to \n\n3.8%, of which only 0.2% with differences larger than 5%. Moreover, the maximum \n\nunsafe deviation decreased from 21% to 6%, while the maximum safe deviation also \n\ndecreased from 51% to 35%.  \n\nAs it was observed for the plate girders with a shear dominant failure analysed at \n\nnormal temperature, the EC3 design expressions are providing safe predictions for the \n\nplate girders affected by the interaction between shear and bending (zone 2). However, \n\nwhen the proposals are considered, a smaller deviation from the average is observed, no \n\nlonger exist unsafe results and the maximum safe deviation is smaller. \n\nRegarding fire design, despite the average utilisation ratio is on the safe side, the EC3 \n\npredictions are unsafe for almost 46% of the girders with a shear dominant failure and \n\n31.0% of the girders with a combined failure. It is important to note that a large part of \n\nunsafe results are beyond the 5% margin. With the application of the proposals \n\npresented in this thesis, the percentage of unsafe results was reduced to 2.7% for the \n\nzone 1 girders. From those 2.7%, only 0.3% are differences larger than 5%. \n\nFurthermore, the maximum unsafe deviation fell significantly from 31% to 10%. \n\nConcerning the zone 2 plate girders, the percentage of unsafe results was substantially \n\nreduced to 1.1%, with no unsafe differences larger than 5%. \n\nHistograms of relative frequency were made for the results of each zone of the shear-\n\nbending interaction diagram, considering the two design approaches above mentioned at \n\nnormal and elevated temperatures. Moreover, working with data from Table 7.3 and \n\nTable 7.4, it is possible to fit the results onto the normal distributions. The histograms \n\nand the normal distributions are presented in Figure 7.21 to Figure 7.23 for normal \n\ntemperature and in Figure 7.24 to Figure 7.26 for elevated temperatures.  \n\n\n\nChapter 7.

Shear buckling resistance \n\n  133 \n\nThe results from Table 7.3 and Table 7.4 are clearly reflected on the histograms \n\npresented above. The larger standard deviation often observed when the proposals are \n\nnot taken into account is coherent with the histograms presented in Figure 7.21 to \n\nFigure 7.26. \n\nWith respect to the normal distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution, it is the \n\nmost important and most widely used distribution in statistics. Considering an arbitrary \n\nsafety margin of 5%, the probability of safety predicted for the EC3 design procedures \n\nis always smaller when the proposals are not taken into account. As an example, \n\nlooking for the results of the girders collapsing due to shear buckling, which are the \n\nfocus of this thesis, a 85.5% probability of safety is forecast for the EC3 procedures at \n\nnormal temperature against the 98.6% of its counterpart. Regarding fire design, a 69.8% \n\nprobability of safety is predicted for the EC3 procedures adapted to elevated \n\ntemperatures against the 96.2% of its counterpart. Not only is the modified procedure \n\npredicted to be safer overall, but the results are much closer to the average value (lower \n\nstandard deviation), which certifies the proposals as a strong improvement over the EC3 \n\ndesign procedures.  \n\nA more detailed statistical analysis was also performed to understand the accuracy of \n\nthe EC3 design procedure in function of different parameters, such as: normalized web \n\nslenderness parameter, aspect ratio, web slenderness, ratio between flanges and web \n\nthicknesses, steel grade and temperature. This detailed statistical analysis is presented in \n\nTable 7.5 for the zone 1 plate girders analysed at normal temperature. Table 7.6 shows \n\nthe results for the zone 1 plate girders subjected to elevated temperatures. The data \n\npresented in these tables was obtained considering the proposals presented in this thesis. \n\nIt is discussed below, together with some charts for an easier understanding of the \n\nachieved conclusions. \n\nA similar procedure was accomplished for the zone 2 plate girders, i.e. the plate girders \n\nexhibiting a combined shear plus bending failure.

Normalized web slenderness \n\nAs mentioned before, the detailed statistical analysis allows evaluating the accuracy of \n\nthe EC3 procedure, taken into account the proposals presented in this document, in \n\nfunction of different parameters. \n\nRegarding the EC3 normalized web slenderness, it was observed in Table 7.5 that the \n\nhighest the web slenderness parameter is, the more conservative the EC3 predictions \n\nare. The same trend was observed for girders with non-rigid and rigid end posts at both \n\nnormal and elevated temperatures. As an example, Figure 7.27 shows the variation of \n\nthe average utilisation ratio for six slenderness parameter ranges of the girders with non-\n\nrigid end posts analysed at normal temperature. The standard deviation is represented by \n\nthe red bars and the maximum and minimum values are illustrated by the grey lines.  \n\n \n\nFigure 7.27 \u2013 Utilisation ratio in function of the web slenderness parameter for the plate girders \n\nwith non-rigid end posts analysed at normal temperature \n\n? Aspect ratio \n\nThe statistical analysis in terms of the aspect ratio showed that the lowest the aspect \n\nratio is, the more conservative the EC3 procedure is. It may be clearly observed in \n\nFigure 7.28, where are plotted, for the group II of plate girders, the web contribution to \n\nshear buckling in terms of the girders aspect ratio.

Shear buckling resistance \n\n137 \n\nwith non-rigid end posts are presented in the top two charts, while the results of the \n\ngirders with rigid end posts are placed below. The orange and yellow points represent \n\nthe girders with larger aspect ratios, while the green and blue points correspond to the \n\ngirders with lower aspect ratios. As one can see, the orange and yellow points are closer \n\nto the design curve, therefore the average nearest 1.0 and the lower standard deviation. \n\nOn the other hand, the green and blue points are more distant from the design curve and \n\nso the higher value for the average utilisation ratio. \n\nFigure 7.28 also indicates that there is a great dispersion of results on the girders with \n\nrigid end posts, when compared with the girders with non-rigid end posts. Furthermore, \n\nit is observed that such dispersion is larger at elevated temperatures. This observation is \n\nfully supported by the difference on the values of standard deviation presented in Table \n\n7.5 and Table 7.6. As regards the girders with rigid end posts, the standard deviation at \n\nnormal temperature is 0.08 for the girders with a/hw ? 1 and 0.07 for the girders with \n\n1 &lt;a/hw ? 2. However, at elevated temperatures these values are 0.14 and 0.08, \n\nrespectively. It represents a substantial increase on the girders with a/hw ? 1, while only \n\na slight increase as observed for the girders with 1 &lt;a/hw ? 2. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 7.28 \u2013 Web contribution to shear buckling of the group II plate girders in function of the \n\nplate girders aspect ratio \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\n\nR\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n[-\n\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter       [-]\n\n20\u00baC - Non-rigid end posts\n\nNew proposal\n\na/hw=0.50\n\na/hw=1.00\n\na/hw=1.50\n\na/hw=2.00\n\na/hw=3.00\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\n\nR\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n,?\n\n[-\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter         [-]\n\n350\u00baC, 500\u00baC and 600\u00baC - Non-rigid end posts\n\nNew proposal\n\na/hw=0.50\n\na/hw=1.00\n\na/hw=1.50\n\na/hw=2.00\n\na/hw=3.00\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\n\nR\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\n\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n[-\n\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter       [-]\n\n20\u00baC - Rigid end posts\n\nNew proposal\n\na/hw=0.50\n\na/hw=1.00\n\na/hw=1.50\n\na/hw=2.00\n\na/hw=3.00\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\n\nR\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n,?\n\n[-\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter         [-]\n\n350\u00baC, 500\u00baC and 600\u00baC - Rigid end posts\n\nNew proposal\n\na/hw=0.50\n\na/hw=1.00\n\na/hw=1.50\n\na/hw=2.00\n\na/hw=3.00\n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n138 \n\n?

Shear buckling resistance \n\n139 \n\n? Ratio between flanges and web thicknesses \n\nWhen analysing the data from Table 7.5 and Table 7.6, it was concluded that the ratio \n\ntf/tw is not a key factor on the accuracy of the EC3 predictions for the girders with non-\n\nrigid end posts at both normal and elevated temperatures. However, for the girders with \n\nrigid end posts that is not really true. In Figure 7.28 it was detected a bigger dispersion \n\nof results on the girders with rigid end posts, mainly at elevated temperatures. Now, it is \n\npossible to observe that there is a correlation between the ratio tf/tw and such dispersion, \n\nwhich occurs mainly for the girders with tf/tw > 3. Although there, this increase on the \n\nresults dispersion is not so evident at normal temperature. But, at elevated temperatures, \n\nit can be easily seen in Figure 7.30. \n\nIn defence of the EC3 design procedure, it worth mentioning that the ratio tf/tw > 3 is not \n\nso common in practice. The ratio tf/tw > 3 results from the choice of testing girders with \n\nquite strong flanges in order to have in most of the cases a failure mode due to shear \n\nbuckling. However, in practice, the flanges are designed to support the bending \n\nmoments and the ratio tf/tw is not high often. Furthermore, it is important to have in \n\nmind that the EC3 design procedure is on the safe side, being more conservative for this \n\nking of plate girders. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 7.30 \u2013 Web contribution to shear buckling of the group II plate girders in function of the \n\nratio between the flanges and web thicknesses \n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\n\nR\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n[-\n\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter       [-]\n\n20\u00baC - Non-rigid end posts\n\nNew proposal\n\ntf/tw ? 2.0\n\n2.0 &lt;tf/tw ?  3.0\n\n3.0 &lt;tf/tw ? 4.0\n\n4.0 &lt;tf/tw ?  5.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\n\nR\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n,?\n\n[-\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter         [-]\n\n350\u00baC, 500\u00baC and 600\u00baC - Non-rigid end posts\n\nNew proposal\n\ntf/tw ? 2.0\n\n2.0 &lt;tf/tw ? 3.0\n\n3.0 &lt;tf/tw ? 4.0\n\n4.0 &lt;tf/tw ? 5.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\n\nR\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n[-\n\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter       [-]\n\n20\u00baC - Rigid end posts\n\nNew proposal\n\ntf/tw ? 2.0\n\n2.0 &lt;tf/tw ?  3.0\n\n3.0 &lt;tf/tw ?  4.0\n\n4.0 &lt;tf/tw=5.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\n\nR\ne\nd\n\nu\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n f\na\nc\nto\n\nr\n  \n?\n\nw\n,?\n\n[-\n]\n\nSlenderness parameter         [-]\n\n350\u00baC, 500\u00baC and 600\u00baC - Rigid end posts\n\nNew proposal\n\ntf/tw ? 2.0\n\n2.0 &lt;tf/tw ? 3.0\n\n3.0 &lt;tf/tw ? 4.0\n\n4.0 &lt;tf/tw ? 5.0\n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n140 \n\n? Steel grade \n\nThe influence of the steel grade on the accuracy of the EC3 predictions is evaluated \n\nhere. Four steel grades were analysed in this thesis. As it can be seen in Figure 7.31, the \n\nconservative nature of the EC3 predictions at normal temperature slightly increases with \n\nthe increase of the steel grade. Regarding EC3 predictions at elevated temperatures, this \n\nbehaviour is more evident. Furthermore, it is possible to note that the EC3 predictions \n\nare more conservative for the girders with rigid end posts, when compared with the \n\ngirders with non-rigid end posts. \n\n \na) \n\n \nb) \n\nFigure 7.31 \u2013 Average utilisation ratio and standard deviation in function of the steel grade \n\n0.80\n\n0.90\n\n1.00\n\n1.10\n\n1.20\n\n1.30\n\n1.40\n\n1.50\n\n1.60\n\n235 275 355 460\n\nU\nti\n\nli\nsa\n\nti\no\nn\n\n r\na\nti\n\no\n (\n\nU\n)\n\nSteel grade [MPa]\n\n20\u00baC\n\nNon-rigid end posts\n\nRigid end posts\n\n0.80\n\n0.90\n\n1.00\n\n1.10\n\n1.20\n\n1.30\n\n1.40\n\n1.50\n\n1.60\n\n235 275 355 460\n\nU\nti\n\nli\nsa\n\nti\no\nn\n\n r\na\nti\n\no\n (\n\nU\n)\n\nSteel grade [MPa]\n\n350\u00baC, 500\u00baC and 600\u00baC\n\nNon-rigid end posts\n\nRigid end posts\n\n\n\nChapter 7.

The EC3 design procedure to determine the web resistance to shear buckling at \n\nnormal temperature is providing unsafe results for plate girders with normalized \n\nweb slenderness lower than 1.3; \n\n? Small modifications to the reduction factor for the web shear buckling resistance \n\nare proposed in order to improve the safety and precision of the EC3 predictions; \n\n? For the fire design of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling, the \n\napplication of the reduction factors for the stress-strain relationship of steel at \n\nelevated temperatures to the EC3 design procedure is not enough, since there are \n\nstill too many unsafe predictions; \n\n? Consequently, a new reduction factor for the web resistance to shear buckling in \n\nfire situation is proposed, providing safe results when incorporated in the EC3 \n\ndesign procedure. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 8 \n\nShear-bending interaction \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n144 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 8 Shear-bending interaction \n\n8.1 Failure modes \n\n8.2 Evaluation of the EC3 expression to check the interaction between shear and \n\nbending \n\n8.3 Statistical analysis \n\n8.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 8. Shear-bending interaction \n\n   145 \n\nChapter 8 Shear-bending interaction \n\n8.1 Failure modes \n\nThe interaction between shear and bending in steel plate girders subjected to shear \n\nbuckling is analysed in this Chapter. Three different failure modes were observed in the \n\nparametric numerical study: a shear dominant failure characterized by the web shear \n\nbuckling, a bending dominant failure recognized by the local buckling of the \n\ncompression flange and, finally, a combined shear plus bending failure involving and \n\ninteraction of the failure modes mentioned above. \n\nFigure 8.1 shows three different failure modes observed for the same 2-panel plate \n\ngirder in function of its aspect ratio. The plate girder presented in Figure 8.1 has rigid \n\nend posts and it was subjected to 500\u00baC. The designation \u201cPG 1000x10+300x20_S235\u201c \n\nmeans: PG \u2013 plate girder; 1000 \u2013 web depth (mm); 10 \u2013 web thickness (mm); 300 \u2013 \n\nflanges width (mm); 20 \u2013 flanges thickness (mm); S235 \u2013 steel grade.  \n\nThe typical deformed shape of the girders exhibiting a shear dominant failure may be \n\nobserved in Figure 8.1a, where it is visible the web shear buckling and no buckling in \n\nthe flanges. The shear dominant failure changes to a bending dominant failure when the \n\ngirder length is increased from 2 m to 6 m (and consequently the aspect ratio from 1.0 \n\nto 3.0). The failure mechanism is presented in Figure 8.1c. Finally, a combined shear \n\nplus bending failure is obtained for an intermediate span (4 m), as shown in Figure 8.1b. \n\nDifferent failure modes may also be observed for a plate girder with fixed length, as \n\nshown in Figure 8.2. This is obtained increasing the number of transverse stiffeners. \n\nThe reduction of the distance between transverse stiffeners increases the ultimate shear \n\nstrength of plate girders making them less susceptible to the occurrence of shear \n\nbuckling. \n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 5, a single shear-bending interaction diagram must be drawn \n\nfor each plate girder, since it depends on shear resistance (???,?? and ???,??) and \n\nbending resistance (??,??  and ???,??). Figure 8.2 demonstrates that the plate girders \n\nclassification into different zones of the shear-bending interaction diagram, performed \n\nas presented in Chapter 5, can be confirmed by the obtained deformed shape at failure. \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n146 \n\n \na) shear dominant failure (a/hw=1.0) \n\n \nb) combined shear plus bending failure (a/hw=2.0) \n\n \nc) bending dominant failure (a/hw=3.0) \n\nFigure 8.1 \u2013 Example of the failure modes observed for PG 1000x10+300x20_S235 at 500\u00baC \n\n\n\nChapter 8.

For \n\nexample, that is why in Figure 8.3b the \u201cEC3\u201d points with slenderness values higher \n\nthan 4.0 do not have their equivalents in the \u201cEC3 + proposals\u201d points. Those girders \n\nwere classified as zone 2 but with the application of the proposals are now classified as \n\nzone 1.

Shear-bending interaction \n\n   149 \n\nAt normal temperature, Figure 8.3a demonstrates that the obtained improvements are \n\nmainly related to the girders with ???? ? 1.0. The statistical analysis presented in Table \n\n7.3 indicates that EC3 design expression is providing good results, with only 9.2% of \n\nunsafe results. A 97.8% probability of safety is predicted for the EC3 design expression, \n\nif an arbitrary safety margin of 5% is considered, as it can be seen in Figure 7.22. \n\nHowever, the proposals presented in this thesis to improve the EC3 predictions for the \n\nweb resistance to shear buckling (???,??) also improved the results of the shear-bending \n\ninteraction expression, since ???,?? is incorporated in this expression. The dispersion of \n\nresults was reduced (lower standard deviation, lower maximum safe deviation) and the \n\nprobability of safety predicted for the EC3 design procedure is now 100%. \n\nAs concerns elevated temperatures, the improvements given by the proposals were more \n\nsignificant, as shown in Figure 8.3b. The percentage of unsafe results decreased from \n\n30.9% to 1.1% and the standard deviation was also reduced (see Table 7.4). The \n\nprobability of safety predicted for the EC3 interaction expression applied to fire design \n\nrose from 81.5% to 99.6%, as it can be seen in Figure 7.25. \n\nFurthermore, it is perceptible that the highest the web slenderness parameter is, the \n\nlowest is the tendency for the girders have a combined shear plus bending failure \n\nmechanism. At normal temperature, it is visible that the majority of the girders with a \n\ncombined shear plus bending failure has ???? comprised between 0.7 and 2.2. Regarding \n\nthe girders subjected to elevated temperatures, a failure caused by the interaction \n\nbetween shear and bending is registered mainly for girders with 0.8 ? ????,? ? 2.7.  \n\n8.3 Statistical analysis \n\nA detailed statistical analysis, similar to the one performed for the plate girders with a \n\nshear dominant failure (zone 1), was performed for the zone 2 plate girders (combined \n\nshear plus bending failure). Table 8.1 shows the results for the girders tested at normal \n\ntemperature, while the results for the girders subjected to elevated temperatures are \n\nlisted in Table 8.2. The data from both tables is discussed below. As mentioned for the \n\nzone 1 girders, the results for the zone 2 girders were also obtained considering the EC3 \n\ndesign procedures modified by the proposals previously presented. \n\n \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n150 \n\nTable 8.1 \u2013 Detailed statistical analysis of the zone 2 plate girders tested at normal temperature \n\nParameter Range \nNon-rigid end posts Rigid end posts \n\nN Cases Av.

The girders with high \n\nweb slenderness (???? > 3, ?? ??? > 300) are extremely susceptible to the occurrence of \n\nshear buckling, while the girders with high stiffness flanges (?? ??? > 3) have a \n\nconsiderable bending resistance being likely to collapse due to shear.  \n\nConcerning the web slenderness, the higher it is, the more conservative the EC3 \n\npredictions are at both normal and elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the dispersion of \n\nresults increases with the increase of the web slenderness, as can be verified in the \n\nvalues of standard deviation listed in the tables presented above.  \n\nRegarding the aspect ratio, it is observed the opposite. The lowest the aspect ratio is, the \n\nmore conservative the EC3 design procedure is and the highest the dispersion of results \n\nis, for both normal and elevated temperatures. With respect to the influence of the ratio \n\nbetween the flanges and web thicknesses, Table 8.1 and Table 8.2 demonstrate that the \n\nexpression for the interaction between shear and bending suits better the girders with \n\n?? ???  between 2 and 3. \n\nAs regards the steel grade, it is perceptible at both normal and elevated temperatures \n\nthat the increase of the steel yield strength is reflected by an increase on the \n\nconservative degree of the EC3 predictions. Moreover, an higher standard deviation is \n\nalso observed for the girders with higher steel grade. \n\nFinally, when evaluating the influence of the elevated temperature range it was \n\nconcluded that, as it happened for the zone 1 plate girders, there is no correlation \n\nbetween the accuracy of the EC3 design expression and the temperature range.  \n\n8.4 Conclusions \n\nBased on the work presented in Chapter 8, the following general conclusions are drawn: \n\n? The EC3 expression for the V-M interaction provides reasonable results at normal \n\ntemperature. Nevertheless, a small improvement can be observed when the \n\nproposals from previous chapters are taken into account; \n\n? In fire situation the results given by this EC3 expression are not satisfactory, being \n\nrecommended to always have the proposals into account. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 9 \n\nInfluence of different parameters on the \n\nultimate shear strength of steel plate \n\ngirders \n \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n154 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 9 Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of \n\nsteel plate girders \n\n9.1 Shear strength in function of cross-section properties \n\n9.1.1 Normal temperature \n\n9.1.2 Elevated temperatures \n\n9.2 Reduction of strength caused by the elevated temperatures \n\n9.3 End posts \n\n9.3.1 Increase of strength given by the rigid end posts \n\n9.3.2 Influence of the configuration of the rigid end post \n\n9.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 9.

With this thesis it is intended to help engineers \n\non the development of rules which will help designing safe and cost-effective steel plate \n\ngirders subjected to shear buckling. The safety of the expressions adopted in current \n\nEuropean Standards for the design of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling was \n\nevaluated throughout Chapters 6 to 8. \n\nIn this section, the strength enhancement caused by the increase of cross-section \n\nproperties of steel plate girders was evaluated, such as: web thickness, web depth, \n\nflange thickness and steel yield strength, using the numerical results presented before. \n\nThe main goal of this analysis is to help designers providing cost-effective steel plate \n\ngirders. Lately, the influence of the end supports (rigid or non-rigid end posts) on the \n\nultimate shear strength of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling is also evaluated. \n\nThese evaluations are based on the results given by the numerical model. \n\n9.1.1. Normal temperature \n\nThe increase of strength provided by the increase of the web thickness was evaluated \n\nusing the plate girders belonging to group II whose dimensions and geometric \n\nconfiguration are presented in Table 5.2 and Figure 5.1, respectively. The strength \n\nenhancement provided by the increase of the web depth was assessed considering the \n\nsame group of girders. The increase of strength given by the increase of the flange \n\nthickness was evaluated using the group I of plate girders, whose geometric properties \n\nare listed in Table 5.1. Finally, it was calculated the increase of strength provided by the \n\nincrease of the steel yield strength taking into account the plate girders with distance \n\nbetween transverse stiffeners equal to 900 mm belonging to group III, whose \n\ndimensions and geometric configuration are presented in Figure 5.3 and Table 5.3, \n\nrespectively. \n\nThe strength enhancement given by the increase of 1 mm on the web thickness is \n\npresented in Figure 9.1 for plate girders with non-rigid end posts and different aspect \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n156 \n\nratios. Figure 9.2 illustrates the results for the plate girders with rigid end posts. As one \n\ncan see, the highest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement is, for both \n\nplate girders with non-rigid and rigid end posts. For example, the increase of the web \n\nthickness from 4 to 5 mm in a plate girder with non-rigid end posts, hw=1200 mm and \n\na/hw=0.5 provides a strength enhancement of 34%. On the other hand, the same girder \n\nwith a/hw=3.0 provides a strength enhancement of 44%. \n\nIt is important to note that some percentages are lower than expected because the failure \n\nmode of the girders changes. In some cases, increasing 1 mm on the web thickness \n\ncauses the change of the girder failure mode. It happens for the girders with a/hw=1.5 \n\nand tw=10 mm, a/hw=2.0 and tw=9 and 10 mm, and a/hw=3.0 and tw=7, 8, 9 and 10 mm. \n\nFurthermore, the percentage of the increase on the ultimate resistance is generally \n\nhigher than the increased percentage of steel area. The girders where the failure mode \n\nchanges with the increase of the web thickness are the exception. For instance, \n\nincreasing the web thickness from 4 to 5 mm means to increase the area of steel in 25%. \n\nBut this increase of steel area equal to 25% caused an increase on the ultimate bearing \n\ncapacity from 31% (a/hw=0.5) up to 44% (a/hw=3.0). Other example is when the web \n\nthickness is increased from 7 to 8 mm, which means increasing the steel area in \n\napproximately 14%. In this case, the increase on the ultimate resistance ranged between \n\n16% and 22%, always higher than 14%. \n\nIt is also possible to observe that, for the analysed plate girders, the strength \n\nenhancement caused by the increase of the web thickness does not vary much with the \n\ndimension of the web depth, since the increase of steel area is the same irrespective of \n\nthe web depth. In some cases, it slightly increases with the increase of the web depth. \n\nFor example, the increase of the web thickness from 7 to 8 mm, in a plate girder with \n\nnon-rigid end posts and a/hw=1.0, provides a strength enhancement of 20% for the \n\ngirder with hw=800 mm and 21% for the girder with hw=1600 mm. \n\nFinally, comparing Figure 9.1 with Figure 9.2, it is noticeable that the increase on the \n\nweb thickness is more effective on the plate girders with non-rigid end posts, i.e. for the \n\nsame increase on the web thickness, the percentage of the strength enhancement is \n\nlarger on the girders with non-rigid end posts, when compared with the girders with \n\nrigid end posts. Those differences vary from 1% for the girders with high aspect ratios \n\n(a/hw=3.0) to 9% for the girders with low aspect ratios (a/hw=0.5). \n\n\n\nChapter 9.

Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders \n\n   159 \n\nFigure 9.3 shows the strength enhancement caused by the increase of the web depth. \n\nThe plate girders with tw=5 mm are used as an example since the observed behaviour is \n\nthe same irrespective of the web thickness. Unlike what happened with the increase of \n\nthe web thickness, the highest the aspect ratio is, the lowest the strength enhancement is. \n\nAgain in contrast to previously noted when analysing the strength enhancement caused \n\nby the increase of the web thickness, the increase of the web depth is more effective on \n\nthe girders with rigid end posts, when compared with girders with non-rigid end posts. \n\nIn the girders with non-rigid end posts the strength enhancement ranges from 3% up to \n\n11%. On the other hand, the increase of strength varies between 4% and 14% in the \n\ngirders with rigid end posts. \n\nMoreover, the percentage of increased steel is always higher than the percentage of \n\nstrength enhancement. For instance, the increase of steel area caused by the increase of \n\nthe web depth from 800 to 1000 mm is 25% but the maximum strength enhancement \n\nwas 14%. When the web depth is increased from 1400 to 1600 mm (steel area increases \n\n14%), the maximum strength enhancement is only 7%. It makes clear that increasing the \n\nweb depth is not the best solution when it is needed to increase the ultimate shear \n\nstrength of steel plate girders. Assuming the cost as directly proportional to the quantity \n\nof steel, increasing the web depth should be only considered when there is a need to \n\nincrease the resistance bending moment. \n\n \na) \n\n \nb) \n\nFigure 9.3 \u2013 Increase of strength at 20\u00baC given by the increase of the web depth for the girders with \n\ntw=5 mm \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0\n\nS\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n \n\ne\nn\n\nh\na\n\nn\nc\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[%\n\n]\n\na/hw [-]\n\n20\u00baC - Non-rigid end posts (tw=5 mm)\nhw: 800 to 1000 mm\n\nhw: 1000 to 1200 mm\n\nhw: 1200 to 1400 mm\n\nhw: 1400 to 1600 mm\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0\n\nS\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n \n\ne\nn\n\nh\na\n\nn\nc\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[%\n\n]\n\na/hw [-]\n\n20\u00baC - Rigid end posts (tw=5 mm)\nhw: 800 to 1000 mm\n\nhw: 1000 to 1200 mm\n\nhw: 1200 to 1400 mm\n\nhw: 1400 to 1600 mm\n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n160 \n\nThe influence of increasing the flanges thickness on the ultimate resistance of steel plate \n\ngirders subjected to shear buckling was also evaluated.

As an example, Figure 9.4 \n\nshows the increase of strength caused by increments of 2 mm on the flanges thickness \n\nfor the plate girders with hw=1000 mm, since the results are identical irrespective of the \n\nweb depth. As one can see, the increase of the flanges thickness does not cause a \n\nsignificant strength enhancement, ranging from 0.7 up to 3.1 %.

Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders \n\n   161 \n\nIncreasing the steel grade from S235 to S275 corresponds to an increase of 17% on the \n\nsteel yield strength, while increasing the steel grade from S275 to S355 and S355 to \n\nS460 corresponds to an increase of the steel yield strength around 29%. As expected, \n\ndue the buckling phenomena, these values are not reflected on the increase of the \n\nultimate resistance, which is somewhat lower. According to the obtained results, \n\ngenerally the increase on the ultimate resistance is about 71% of the percentage increase \n\nin steel yield strength for girders with non-rigid end posts and 75% for girders with rigid \n\nend posts. For instance, for the girders with non-rigid end posts, the average increase on \n\nthe ultimate resistance is 12% when the steel yield strength increases from S235 to S275 \n\nand 21% for the other consecutive steel grades.

Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders \n\n   163 \n\nThe impact of the web thickness increase is illustrated in Figure 9.7 for the girders with \n\nhw=1200 mm, since as it was at normal temperature the results are not significantly \n\ninfluenced by the size of the web depth. Figure 9.7 demonstrates that the highest the \n\naspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement is, for both plate girders with non-\n\nrigid and rigid end posts. Comparing with 20\u00baC, the strength enhancement is usually 2% \n\nlower at elevated temperatures.  \n\nFurthermore, it is visible that the web thickness increase is more effective on the plate \n\ngirders with non-rigid end posts. It is also important to note that the percentage of \n\nstrength enhancement is higher than the increased percentage of steel area, with \n\nexception of the girders not exhibiting a shear dominant failure. It makes clear that \n\nincreasing the web thickness is the best solution in order to increase the resistance of \n\nsteel plate girders affected by shear buckling. \n\nThe strength enhancement caused by the increase of the web depth is presented in \n\nFigure 9.8. Analysing the girders with non-rigid end posts, it is observed that the lowest \n\nthe aspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement is, in contrast to what occurred \n\nat normal temperature. For the girders with low aspect ratio, the strength enhancement \n\nwas in some cases 5% lower than recorded at 20\u00baC.  \n\nRegarding the girders with rigid end posts, it was observed the same pattern obtained at \n\nnormal temperature: the lowest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement \n\nis. The strength enhancement was generally 1% lower. Moreover, as it happened for \n\nnormal temperature, the percentage of strength enhancement is always lower than the \n\npercentage of increased steel area. \n\nFigure 9.9 shows the strength enhancement provided by the increase of the flanges \n\nthickness. It was observed an increase on the ultimate resistance up to 2%, when \n\ncompared to the results obtained at normal temperature. At elevated temperatures, the \n\nstrength enhancement caused by the increase of the flanges thickness ranges between 1 \n\nand 5%, which is still considered a non-significant strength enhancement. Furthermore, \n\nit is perceptible that the highest the aspect ratio is, the lower the strength enhancement \n\nis. \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n164 \n\n \na) \n\n \nb) \n\nFigure 9.7 \u2013 Increase of strength at 500\u00baC given by the increase of the web thickness for the girders \n\nwith hw=1200 mm \n\n \n\n \na) \n\n \nb) \n\nFigure 9.8 \u2013 Increase of strength at 500\u00baC given by the increase of the web depth for the girders \n\nwith tw=5 mm \n\n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0\n\nS\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n \n\ne\nn\n\nh\na\n\nn\nc\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[%\n\n]\n\na/hw [-]\n\n500\u00baC - Non-rigid end posts (hw=1200 mm) tw: 4 to 5 mm\n\ntw: 5 to 6 mm\n\ntw: 6 to 7 mm\n\ntw: 7 to 8 mm\n\ntw: 8 to 9 mm\n\ntw: 9 to 10 mm\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0\n\nS\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n \n\ne\nn\n\nh\na\n\nn\nc\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[%\n\n]\n\na/hw [-]\n\n500\u00baC - Rigid end posts (hw=1200 mm) tw: 4 to 5 mm\n\ntw: 5 to 6 mm\n\ntw: 6 to 7 mm\n\ntw: 7 to 8 mm\n\ntw: 8 to 9 mm\n\ntw: 9 to 10 mm\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0\n\nS\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n \n\ne\nn\n\nh\na\n\nn\nc\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[%\n\n]\n\na/hw [-]\n\n500\u00baC - Non-rigid end posts (tw=5 mm)\nhw: 800 to 1000 mm\n\nhw: 1000 to 1200 mm\n\nhw: 1200 to 1400 mm\n\nhw: 1400 to 1600 mm\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0\n\nS\ntr\n\ne\nn\n\ng\nth\n\n \n\ne\nn\n\nh\na\n\nn\nc\ne\nm\n\ne\nn\n\nt \n[%\n\n]\n\na/hw [-]\n\n500\u00baC - Rigid end posts (tw=5 mm)\nhw: 800 to 1000 mm\n\nhw: 1000 to 1200 mm\n\nhw: 1200 to 1400 mm\n\nhw: 1400 to 1600 mm\n\n\n\nChapter 9.

The results for the girders with non-rigid end posts \n\nare presented in Figure 9.10, while Figure 9.11 shows the results for the girders with \n\nrigid end posts.  \n\nAs it was observed at normal temperature, the web slenderness (hw/tw) has no significant \n\ninfluence on the strength enhancement. Additionally, it is noticeable that the strength \n\nenhancement decreases about 1% for the girders with aspect ratio equal to 3.0. Finally, \n\nit is perceptible when comparing Figure 9.10 with Figure 9.11 that the strength \n\nenhancement is slightly higher for the girders with rigid end posts. \n\nFurthermore, it was observed that increasing the steel yield strength causes greater \n\nresistance benefits at elevated temperatures. At normal temperature, the increase on the \n\nultimate resistance in the girders with non-rigid end posts was about 71% of the \n\npercentage increase in steel yield strength.

With that purpose, the numerical results of the plate girders belonging to group \n\nII were considered. In order to analyse only girders with a failure caused by shear \n\nbuckling, only the girders with web thickness equal to 4 mm were taken into account. \n\nIt was observed that the reduction of resistance, caused by the elevated temperatures, \n\nincreases with the increase of the web depth dimension, for the girders with a/hw=0.5, \n\nranging between 11% and 20%. For the remaining girders, with higher aspect ratios, the \n\nvariation of the percentage of strength reduction with the increase of the web depth is \n\nquite small. In order to analyse the influence of the aspect ratio on the reduction of \n\nresistance caused by the elevated temperatures, it was decided to present here (see \n\nFigure 9.12) only the girders with hw=1000 mm, since the conclusions are the same \n\nirrespective of the web depth. Figure 9.12 demonstrates that the highest the aspect ratio \n\nis, the highest the strength reduction caused by the elevated temperatures is.  \n\nFurthermore, the strength reduction on the girders with non-rigid end posts is higher \n\nwhen compared with the girders with rigid end posts. The lower the aspect ratio is, the \n\nhigher this difference is. It means that the girders with rigid end post are more capable \n\nto anchor the different stresses distribution imposed by the elevated temperatures that \n\noccur during a fire. For the girders with non-rigid end posts, the average values of the \n\nstrength reduction according to the applied uniform elevated temperatures of 350\u00baC, \n\n500\u00baC and 600\u00baC are 21%, 39% and 64%, respectively.

Girders with rigid end posts \n\ninvolve higher costs resulting from the additional plates, but also from the welding. \n\nHence, when designing, it is very important to know when the rigid end posts are more \n\neffective and the extra costs are reflected in a considerable additional resistance. With \n\nthat purpose, an analysis about their influence was performed. The increase of strength \n\ngiven by the rigid end posts is evaluated, as well as the influence of its configuration, \n\ni.e. the distance between the transverse stiffeners which form the rigid end post and the \n\nthickness of the transverse stiffener which is not supporting the reaction force. \n\n9.3.1 Increase of strength given by the rigid end posts \n\nFirstly, the increase of strength given by the condition of rigid end post is evaluated. \n\nThe numerical results from the group II of plate girders, where five different aspect \n\nratios (a/hw) were considered, are used to perform this analysis. Figure 9.13 illustrates \n\nthe differences on the resistance from the web to shear buckling given by the application \n\nof a rigid end post instead of a non-rigid end post.

It can be clearly observed in the charts from \n\nFigure 9.13, where the increase in the web resistance is significant for low aspect ratios \n\n(0.5 and 1.0), decreasing to girders with intermediate aspect ratios (1.5 and 2.0), to \n\nfinally be almost nill for girders with a/hw = 3.0. It is directly related to the fact that the \n\nlower the aspect ratio is, the more the condition of rigid end post influences the whole \n\nbehaviour of the web panel, since the percentage of the perimeter constrained gets \n\nhigher. Furthermore, it is perceptible that the highest the web slenderness parameter is, \n\nthe highest the increase of strength given by the rigid end post is.  \n\nFigure 9.14 shows the average strength enhancement, between the plate girders with \n\nrigid and non-rigid end posts, in function of the plate girders aspect ratio (a/hw). As one \n\ncan see, it is clear that the lower the aspect ratio is, the more effective the rigid end post \n\nis. At normal temperature, the average strength enhancement of the group II of plate \n\ngirders was 9.2% for the girders with a/hw=0.5, decreasing for girders with intermediate \n\naspect ratios, being almost negligible (0.6%) for girders with a/hw=3.0. \n\nMoreover, Figure 9.14 also reveals that the rigid end post is more effective at elevated \n\ntemperatures than at normal temperature. At elevated temperatures, the strength \n\nenhancement is higher but the tendency observed at normal temperature remains the \n\nsame, with the average values ranging from 1.7% (a/hw=3.0) up to 20.3% (a/hw=0.5).  \n\nThe influence of other geometrical ratios was also analysed, as illustrated in Figure \n\n9.15. The strength enhancement provided by the rigid end post is represented in Figure \n\n9.15a in function of the web slenderness and in Figure 9.15b in terms of the ratio \n\nbetween the flanges and web thicknesses. It is visible that the higher these ratios are, the \n\nhigher the increase of strength is, at both normal and elevated temperatures. On the \n\nother hand, it is also possible to notice that the maximum strength enhancement is \n\n26.5% at normal temperature and 46.5% in fire situation, which is a significant \n\ndifference. \n\nThus, it was concluded that the steel plate girders where the application of rigid end \n\nposts, instead of non-rigid end posts, is more profitable are those with the following \n\ncharacteristics: low a/hw, high hw/tw and high tf/tw. \n\n\n\nChapter 9.

The condition of rigid end post depends on the distance \n\nbetween the transverse stiffeners which forms the end post and on the area of the \n\ntransverse stiffeners. Thus, a rigid end post may have different configurations. In this \n\nsection it is intended to evaluate the influence of the rigid end post configuration on the \n\nultimate shear strength of the plate girder.  \n\nWith that purpose, the numerical model presented in Chapter 4 was used, considering a \n\n2-panel plate girder with hw =1000 mm, bf = 300 mm and tf = 20 mm. Three different \n\nweb thicknesses were considered (4, 5 and 6 mm). The intermediate transverse stiffener \n\n(placed at mid-span on the position of application of forces) has 20 mm thickness, as \n\nwell as the internal transverse stiffeners of the rigid end posts which carry the reaction \n\nforces of the supports (stiffener \u201cAu\u201d in Figure 3.14). \n\nThe influence on the ultimate shear strength of the rigid end post configuration was \n\nevaluated in two ways. Firstly, influence of the distance between the transverse \n\nstiffeners which form the rigid end post (distance \u201ce\u201d in Figure 3.14) was evaluated, \n\nconsidering three different values: 100 mm, 200 mm (the value considered in the \n\nnumerical analyses presented before) and 300 mm, as shown in Figure 9.16. \n\nAfterwards, the thickness of the external transverse stiffeners of the rigid end posts \n\n(stiffener \u201cAe\u201d in Figure 3.14 and the blue stiffener in Figure 9.16) was ranged from 5 \n\nup to 20 mm, by increments of 5 mm, in order to assess its influence on the ultimate \n\nshear capacity of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling.  \n\n   \n\na) e = 100 mm b) e = 200 mm c) e = 300 mm \n\nFigure 9.16 \u2013 Rigid end post configurations analysed in this section (example for a/hw=1.0) \n\n\n\nChapter 9. Influence of different parameters on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders \n\n   173 \n\nThe girders were tested at normal temperature and subjected to a uniform elevated \n\ntemperature of 500\u00baC, which results in a total of 234 additional numerical tests. The \n\ngeometric imperfections and the residual stresses were taken into account. The results \n\nobtained for the girders analysed at normal temperature are listed in Table 9.1, while the \n\nresults of the girders subjected to 500\u00baC are presented in Table 9.2. The ultimate shear \n\ncapacity numerically obtained is called \u201cVnr\u201d and \u201cVr\u201d for the girders with non-rigid and \n\nrigid end posts, respectively. The columns \u201cDif.\u201d correspond to the increase of strength \n\nprovided by the different configurations of the rigid end post when compared to the \n\nresistance of the girders with non-rigid end posts. \n\nRegarding the influence at 20\u00baC of the distance \u201ce\u201d between the transverse stiffeners \n\nwhich form the rigid end post, usually the highest it is, the lowest the increase of \n\nstrength is, as illustrated in Figure 9.17a. However, at 500\u00baC the opposite may be \n\nobserved for the girders with a/hw=1.0 and 2.0 (see Figure 9.17b). Figure 9.17 also \n\nshows that the condition of rigid end post is more effective in fire situation. Moreover, \n\nthe increase of strength at elevated temperature comparatively to normal temperature is \n\nso much higher as the greater the distance \u201ce\u201d is. For example, the increase of strength \n\nof the girder with a/hw=1.0, hw/tw=200 and e=100 mm is 9.4% at 20\u00baC and 17.0% at \n\n500\u00baC (7.6% higher), and for the girder with a/hw=1.0, hw/tw=200 and e=200 mm the \n\ncorrespondent values are 8.2% at 20\u00baC and 24.5% at 500\u00baC (16.3% higher). On the \n\nother hand, it is also perceptible that the higher the web slenderness (hw/tw) is, the more \n\nevident the increase in the ultimate shear strength given by the rigid end post is, at both \n\nnormal and elevated temperatures. It is also observed that, as mentioned before, the \n\nlowest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength enhancement is, due to the increase of \n\nthe percentage of the perimeter constrained. \n\nConcerning the thickness of the external transverse stiffener of the rigid end post, \n\nFigure 9.18 demonstrates its influence on the increase of strength given by the rigid end \n\npost is not quite significant. By another words, providing a girder with non-rigid end \n\nposts with two additional transverse stiffeners changing the end configuration to rigid \n\nend posts may cause a substantial impact on the ultimate shear strength (the maximum \n\nincrease observed was almost 15% and 30% at 20\u00baC and 500\u00baC, respectively).

The most cost-effective solution to improve the ultimate bearing capacity of steel \n\nplate girders under shear loading is to increase the web thickness; \n\n? The reduction of resistance in case of fire is higher in the girders with non-rigid end \n\nposts, when compared to the girders with rigid end posts; \n\n? The highest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength loss caused by the elevated \n\ntemperatures is; \n\n\n\nChapter 9.

The application of rigid end posts is more profitable in girders with the \n\nfollowing characteristics: low a/hw, high hw/tw and high tf/tw; \n\n? The influence of the configuration of the rigid end posts is not significant in plate \n\ngirders with high aspect ratios. However, it may be important for the safety nature \n\nof the EC3 predictions of the girders with low aspect ratios. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 10 \n\nFinal considerations \n \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n182 \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 10 Final considerations \n\n10.1 Conclusions \n\n10.2 Future developments \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 10. Final considerations \n\n183 \n\nChapter 10 Final considerations \n\n10.1 Conclusions \n\nThe lack of guidance for the fire design of steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling \n\nhas been the main motivation for this research work. In this section, the main findings \n\nand conclusions achieved during the research are presented. \n\nThe first stage of this research has been a literature review in order to better understand \n\nthe behaviour of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling. Having finalised this \n\nstage, it has been important to analyse the design recommendations implemented in the \n\nEuropean Standards in order to know where they would be improved. Then, bearing in \n\nmind that the absence of fire design guidelines needed to be corrected, a plan \n\ncomprising different tasks has been stablished. \n\nThe first was to develop a solid numerical model able to accurately reproduce the \n\nbehaviour of steel plate girders affected by shear buckling at both normal and elevated \n\ntemperatures, which would be the basis of the parametric study involving around 5000 \n\nnumerical simulations conducted for evaluating the accuracy of the design procedure \n\nimplemented in EC3 to predict the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders affected \n\nby shear buckling. Then, this numerical model was duly validated against experimental \n\ntests at both normal and elevated temperatures. It was shown that the numerical model \n\ndeveloped in the FEM software SAFIR provides a good approximation to the actual \n\nbehaviour of steel plate girders and it is able to accurately predict the ultimate shear \n\nstrength of steel plate girders under shear, as well as their failure modes. \n\nA numerical study about the influence of the geometric imperfections and residual \n\nstresses on the ultimate resistance of steel plate girders at normal temperature and in \n\ncase of fire was also performed. It was observed that do not have into account the \n\ngeometric imperfections conducts to unrealistic shear buckling resistances. At 20\u00baC, the \n\nhigher the maximum amplitude of the geometric imperfections is, the more conservative \n\nthe results are. However, at elevated temperatures the maximum amplitude of the \n\ngeometric imperfections has no significant influence on the ultimate capacity of the \n\nanalysed plate girders. Furthermore, the consideration of the maximum amplitude \n\nrecommended in EC3 is too severe for the numerical modelling of experimental tests, \n\nbeing tw/10 an appropriate value to use for that purpose. Regarding the residual stresses, \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n184 \n\ntheir influence on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders is high at normal \n\ntemperature. However, they have no significant influence in fire situation. \n\nAfterwards, based on the results of the parametric numerical study, the EC3 design \n\nprocedure at normal temperature and its use for fire design by the application of the \n\nreduction factors from Part 1-2 of EC3 (CEN, 2010b) were evaluated. It has been \n\ndemonstrated that the EC3 expression for the prediction of the flanges contribution to \n\nshear buckling resistance was not providing accurate results at both normal and elevated \n\ntemperatures. A corrective coefficient to improve the accuracy of the expression to \n\ndetermine the position of the plastic hinges in the flanges, and consequently improve the \n\nprecision of the EC3 predictions for the contribution from the flanges to shear buckling \n\nresistance, has been proposed. \n\nThe next task of the plan initially created was to evaluate the EC3 design procedure to \n\ndetermine the resistance from the web to shear buckling. For that purpose, the \n\ncontribution from the flanges previously improved was subtracted from the full \n\nresistance of the girder given by the numerical model, since it could not give the web \n\nresistance alone. Small modifications to the EC3 design procedure at normal \n\ntemperature have been proposed in order to provide safer and more accurate predictions. \n\nFurthermore, new expressions for the calculation of the web resistance to shear buckling \n\nin fire situation have also been proposed. \n\nTo finish the assessment of the accuracy of the EC3 design expressions, the expression \n\nfor the interaction between shear and bending was also evaluated. It has been observed \n\nthat the EC3 expression provides satisfactory results at normal temperature. \n\nNevertheless, a slight improvement may be observed when the proposals are taken into \n\naccount. Regarding fire design, the results given by this EC3 expression are not \n\nsatisfactory (around 1/3 of unsafe results), being recommended to always have the \n\nproposals into account. \n\nIn the last stage, a study about the influence of different parameters on the ultimate \n\nshear strength of steel plate girders has been performed in order to help the designer to \n\nprovide cost-effective plate girders. The strength enhancement caused by the increase of \n\nthe cross-section properties (web thickness, web depth, flange thickness and steel yield \n\nstrength) of a steel girder was evaluated. It was observed that the most cost-effective \n\n\n\nChapter 10. Final considerations \n\n185 \n\nsolution to improve the ultimate resistance of a steel plate girder affected by shear \n\nbuckling is to increase the web thickness.  \n\nThe reduction of strength caused by the elevated temperatures was also evaluated. It has \n\nbeen demonstrated that the highest the aspect ratio is, the highest the strength reduction \n\ncaused by the elevated temperatures is. Furthermore, it has been observed that this \n\nstrength reduction is more significant on the girders with non-rigid end posts, when \n\ncompared to the girders with rigid end posts.  \n\nAfterwards, an analysis about the influence of the end posts has been carried out. \n\nFirstly, the increase of strength given by the condition of rigid end post has been \n\nevaluated, being concluded that the steel plate girders where the application of rigid end \n\nposts is more profitable are those with the following characteristics: low a/hw, high hw/tw \n\nand high tf/tw. \n\nFinally, the influence of the configuration of the rigid end post has been analysed. It was \n\nconcluded that its influence is not substantial for plate girders with high aspect ratios. \n\nHowever, the configuration of the rigid end post may be relevant for the safety nature of \n\nthe EC3 predictions of the girders with low aspect ratios. \n\n10.2 Future developments \n\nDuring the development of this research work, different important issues related to the \n\noccurrence of shear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire are discussed and \n\nsome new design expressions are proposed. The main effort was done in order to fulfill \n\nthe lack of guidance on the European Standards about this topic. However, further \n\ninvestigation is still needed. This final section describes possible future research areas. \n\n? Fire resistance experimental tests \n\nThe results of this thesis were based in numerical simulations, through the use of the \n\nfinite element methods. Although the numerical model was duly validated against some \n\nof the few experimental tests found in the literature, numerical simulations do not \n\nalways reproduce perfectly the real behaviour of the structures.  \n\nDue to the limited size of furnaces and the high cost of the fire resistance experimental \n\ntests, there are in the literature only few experimental tests of steel plate girders under \n\nshear loading at elevated temperatures. It would be important performing more fire \n\n\n\nShear buckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire \n\n \n\n186 \n\nresistance experimental tests, since they could reduce the distance between the real \n\nbehaviour of the structures and test conditions, when compared with numerical \n\nsimulations. \n\n? Fire resistance experimental tests on stainless steel plate girders \n\nThe absence of fire resistance experimental tests is even more serious in stainless steel \n\nplate girders. During the development of this thesis it was possible to develop a \n\nnumerical model for stainless steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling (Reis, et al., \n\n2016b). This numerical model was satisfactorily validated with experimental tests at \n\nnormal temperature. However, no fire resistance experimental tests in stainless steel \n\nplate girders under shear loading were found on the literature. As there is no guidance \n\non the European Standards for the design of stainless steel plate girders affected by \n\nshear buckling, it would be of significant importance performing fire resistance \n\nexperimental tests in order to validate the numerical model, that posteriorly would be \n\nthe basis of a parametric numerical study whose results are necessary for the evaluation \n\nof the application of the design expressions at normal temperature from Part 1-4 of EC3 \n\n(CEN, 2006a) to fire design. \n\n? Stainless steel \n\nAlthough more expensive than the carbon steel, stainless steel plate girders may be \n\ncompetitive due to their smaller need of thermal protection against fire, adding this \n\nadvantage to others such as the durability, low maintenance, aesthetic appearance and \n\ncorrosion resistance. \n\nHowever, as mentioned in previous point, there is no guidance in EC3 for the fire \n\ndesign of stainless steel plate girders subjected to shear buckling at elevated \n\ntemperatures. Thus, a research work similar to the one performed in this thesis should \n\nbe performed for stainless steel plate girders, in order to cover the lack of fire design \n\nrules in EC3.  \n\n? Plate girders with longitudinal stiffeners \n\nThe design expressions proposed in this thesis for the safety evaluation of shear \n\nbuckling in steel plate girders exposed to fire were based on transversally stiffened plate \n\ngirders. Despite the application of longitudinal stiffeners is not so common as the use of \n\n\n\nChapter 10. Final considerations \n\n187 \n\ntransverse stiffeners, further analysis is required in this specific topic in order to extend \n\nthe conclusions achieved for the evaluated cased to a general case of longitudinal \n\nstiffening. \n\n? Different loading types and steel grades \n\nThe numerical model developed in this thesis considers the loading by the application of \n\na concentrated force at mid-span. Other loading types should be considered, as for \n\nexample the application of uniformly distributed loading over all span of the girder. \n\nFurthermore, only steel grades until 460 MPa were taken into account in this thesis. \n\nHigh strength steel grades should also be considered in the future. \n\n? Non-uniform temperatures \n\nNon-uniform temperatures may impose additional forces on the thin webs of steel plate \n\ngirders and even chance the failure mode. Thus, it would be important to study their \n\ninfluence on the ultimate shear strength of steel plate girders. \n\nHowever, it is important do not forget the difficulty of implementing in the European \n\nStandards a simple calculation method that includes non-uniform temperatures. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBibliographic references \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nBibliographic references \n\n \n\n  191 \n\nBibliographic references \n\nAISC.
