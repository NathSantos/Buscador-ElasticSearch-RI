A \n\nEngenharia de Tecidos \u00e9 uma \u00e1rea de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o que est\u00e1 a crescer exponencialmente e que \n\ntem o potencial de desenvolver novos tratamentos, livres de rejei\u00e7\u00e3o imunol\u00f3gica, uma vez que \n\ns\u00e3o utilizadas c\u00e9lulas do pr\u00f3prio paciente. No entanto, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel aumentar esse potencial de \n\ncompatibilidade com o paciente combinando Engenharia Reversa com Prototipagem R\u00e1pida. \n\nCom isto visa-se o desenvolvimento de uma estrutura biodegrad\u00e1vel e compat\u00edvel tanto \n\nimunologicamente com estruturalmente, que vai sendo progressivamente substitu\u00edda por novo \n\ntecido at\u00e9 se alcan\u00e7ar uma regenera\u00e7\u00e3o definitiva do disco intervertebral. \n\nA prova-de-conceito preliminar desta estrat\u00e9gia terap\u00eautica \u00e9 reportada neste estudo atrav\u00e9s da \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o tanto de c\u00e9lulas, como a pr\u00f3pria estrutura e morfologia, do disco intervertebral de \n\ncoelho. A estrutura do anel fibroso foi replicada por Engenharia Reversa e Prototipagem R\u00e1pida \n\nem policaprolactona, enquanto que para servir como substituto do n\u00facleo pulposo foram \n\nencapsuladas c\u00e9lulas num hidrogel de goma gelana metacrilada. A citotoxicidade, \n\ncomportamento mec\u00e2nico, morfologia superficial e porosidade da r\u00e9plica do anel fibroso foram \n\nanalisadas. Verificou-se que a porosidade \u00e9 similar ao disco nativo e que o n\u00edvel de \n\nbiocompatibilidade est\u00e1 acima de 80%. As imagens de miscroscopia mostraram que as v\u00e1rias \n\ncamadas da estrutura apresentam uma boa liga\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s a solidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do pol\u00edmero. A ades\u00e3o, \n\nprolifera\u00e7\u00e3o e viabilidade celular na goma gelana metacrilada foram analisadas at\u00e9 21 dias de \n\ncultura. Observou-se uma maior actividade metab\u00f3lica nas c\u00e9lulas do n\u00facleo pulposo do que na \n\nlinha celular de fibroblastos, ambas encapsuladas em goma gelana metacrilada. Como trabalho \n\nfuturo, pretende-se utilizar esta estrat\u00e9gia para tratar casos de degenera\u00e7\u00e3o do disco de uma \n\nforma efetiva em que o resultado final, ap\u00f3s absor\u00e7\u00e3o da estrutura, \u00e9 um disco intervertebral \n\nnativo biomecanicamente funcional. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Disco Intervertebral; Engenharia de Tecidos; Engenharia Reversa; \n\nPrototipagem R\u00e1pida; Tratamento Personalisado. \n\n  \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nIntervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration disease (IDD) is considered the main cause for \n\nlow back pain (LBP), which has a world socioeconomic burden of 70 billion euros a year. \n\nTissue Engineering (TE) is an exponentially growing area due to its potential of finding patient-\n\nspecific treatments in terms of immunological compatibility by using the patient\u2019s own cells. \n\nThough, it is possible to increase TE patient-specificity by combining other technologies such as \n\nReverse Engineering (RE) and Rapid Prototyping (RP). In this sense, it is possible to prepare a \n\nbiodegradable scaffold that is both immunological and structurally compatible. This strategy has \n\nthe potential to significantly increase implant integration and decrease immunological rejection, \n\nallowing the scaffold to be progressively replaced with newly synthesised tissue to ultimately \n\nregenerate the IVD into a fully functional anatomical motion segment. \n\nHerein is reported a preliminary proof-of-concept for that strategy using rabbit IVD\u2019s \n\ncells as well as morphology and structure. In this sense, the annulus fibrosus (AF) structure was \n\nreplicated by RE and RP into a polycaprolactone scaffold, and the cells were encapsulated in \n\nmethacrylated gellan gum (GG-MA) hydrogel as a nucleus pulposus (NP) substitute. The AF \n\nscaffold\u2019s cytotoxicity, mechanical behaviour, porosity and superficial morphology were also \n\nanalysed. It was observed a significant level of biocompatibility from the AF replica and a \n\nsimilar porosity in relation with the native IVD. Cell adhesion, proliferation and viability were \n\nassessed until 21 days of culture in GG-MA. The metabolic activity was higher in the NP cells \n\nthan in the fibroblast cell line, both cultured in GG-MA. In the future, this novel strategy is \n\nenvisaged to treat IDD, and remove LBP, by fully regenerating the intervertebral disc. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Intervertebral Disc; Tissue Engineering; Reverse Engineering; Rapid Prototyping; \n\nPatient-specific. \n\n  \n\n\n\nviii \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nix \n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\n \n\nI would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to the 3B\u2019s Research Group and \n\nProf. Doutor Rui L. Reis, who not only gave me the possibility of working in this stimulating \n\ngroup with state-of-the-art equipment, but also for allowing me to work under his supervision. It \n\nis truly a golden opportunity to have as supervisor the President of the Tissue Engineering and \n\nRegenerative Medicine International Society, which was recently appointed Commander of the \n\nOrdem Militar de Sant\u2019Iago de Espada by the President of the Portuguese Republic, and won the \n\nClemson\u2019s prize among many other distinctions with no less credit. However, if there is a \n\nperson that really gave me direct supervision during this project was Doutor J. Miguel Oliveira. \n\nHe is my role model on how I want to be as a researcher, with collaborations, projects and \n\nprizes exponentially increasing, which will definitely make him one of the best Tissue \n\nEngineering researchers in the world. I never saw such a dedication and tireless working \n\nefficiency. I am extremely grateful to Doutora Joana Silva-Correia, who although having had a \n\nbaby while I was doing my thesis managed to teach me encapsulation and culturing techniques \n\nneeded for me to accomplish this work as well as proofreading my work with great detailed \n\nattention. I look at her on how to express my data in a transparent and flawless manner, with \n\nextreme ethics. I thank Doutor Vitor Correlo for helping me work with the Istron Mechanical \n\nTesting System and the Twin-screw Extruder. I would like to thank Prof\u00aa. Doutora Cec\u00edlia Le\u00e3o \n\nfor being so nice to help me find a thesis in Universidade do Minho, and in granting me the \n\npossibility to make my first contact with this thesis. \n\nI would like to acknowledge Prof\u00aa. Doutora Cec\u00edlia Calado for all the support during my \n\nstudies in Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade Cat\u00f3lica. And also together with Prof. \n\nDoutor Manuel Barata Marques for having prepared and created this really interesting and \n\ndynamic graduation, which now I am able to see how important were all those courses that at \n\nthe beginning I could not understand their relevance. If I went back to the end of the highschool, \n\nI would chose this exact graduation in this Faculty again. On an entirely different subject, I \n\nappreciate all the patience and time spent while I was continually bothering both with academic \n\nassociation problems in my duty as vice-president of the academic association. To Prof. Pedro \n\nSim\u00f5es I acknowledge my first contact with Tissue Engineering and Immunology. These were \n\nthe only two courses that Prof. Pedro taught me, however I found his classes so interesting that \n\nwhen I was searching for a thesis my main choices were only between these two courses/fields. \n\nI thank all people working in 3B\u2019s Research Group that helped me in my work, and \n\nmost of all for the after/off work time that we spent. I met a lot of foreign people in 3B\u2019s that \n\n\n\nx \n \n\nshared their life stories and views, which come from completely different backgrounds and from \n\nall parts of the world.  \n\nI would like to acknowledge in a special way Daniela Pacheco for sharing with me her \n\nlove for science research. I thank her for helping me to maintain focus in finishing the thesis at \n\ntimes that seemed this thesis would never end, which were several. When I started at 3B\u2019s I was \n\nsupposed to study the state-of-the-art regarding the subject of this thesis, however, sometimes I \n\ndid not want to sit on my desk reading papers, but instead to start working in the lab, she kindly \n\nshowed me around and helped me gain practical experience in the lab. She proofread my work \n\nin situations that I was exhausted and could not read another sentence. Daniela made possible to \n\ncome work afterhours, on weekends and holydays when I needed and she could just go enjoy \n\nher day off instead, always with the attitude \u201cif there is work to be done, (let\u2019s) do it!\u201d. To her I \n\nexpress my full gratitude. \n\nI thank my colleagues Daniel Nunes, Elisete Duarte, Patr\u00edcia Bacelar, Patr\u00edcia Silva, and \n\nPedro J\u00fadice for the teamwork and sense of community. As the only MSc students in our year, \n\nwe were only six, but we had a far greater determination not only to achieve good grades but \n\nmost of all for learning. There were times that we surrounded the Professor, which was giving \n\nthe class, with questions and more questions and we only let go when we got the answer and \n\nmade sure that everyone of us understood. Therefore, I am grateful for this small community \n\nfeeling that made me learn the courses I had with full long-lasting understanding of the given \n\nsubjects, which in the end truly helped me in the thesis. \n\nI would like to thank Materialise NV\u00a9 for allowing me to use a trial version of their \n\nsoftware, without which it would have been impossible to make this work. \n\nLast but definitely not least, I would like to thank my mother and my sister Catarina for \n\nall the tasty homemade food that always felt like I was eating at home. However, if this thesis \n\nwas possible to happen in every sense, from getting to start it until enabling to finish it, was my \n\nfather. He was the one that gave me the chance to go to Vienna, to the World TERMIS, in 2012 \n\nto find Prof. Rui Reis to ask him for this thesis. He gave me the best toy an Engineer can have, a \n\n3D printer, which was the most important equipment I needed for this thesis, without it I could \n\nnot have prepared the scaffolds. I thank my father for contributing indirectly in my decision to \n\nstudy/follow the \u201cBio\u201d world that alongside with my innate attraction towards Engineering \n\nmade me chose to study Biomedical Engineering. However, the last push to study Biomedical \n\nEngineering was given by Prof\u00aa. Doutora Isabel Spencer-Martins that in 2005 opened my eyes \n\nfor the potentialities of this field for the future, and that I would regret not being part of it. If I \n\nnever studied Biomedical Engineering this thesis would not have been made, for that reason I \n\nam truly thankful. \n\n\n\nxi \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxii \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxiii \n \n\nTable of Contents \n\n \n\nI.

General Introduction: Advanced Regenerative Strategies for \n\nTreatment of the Intervertebral Disc degeneration \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Impact of Low Back Pain and the Promise of Advanced Therapies \n\n \n\nLow back pain (LBP) is a major issue in our society these days, mainly in terms of \n\nsocioeconomic impact and quality of life. Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration disease \n\n(IDD) is believed to be the main cause for LBP\n1,2\n\n. Tissue engineering (TE) and regenerative \n\nmedicine (RM; TERM) are an application of multidisciplinary tools by researchers, \n\nengineers, and physicians to construct biological substitutes that can mimic tissues for \n\ndiagnostic and research, with the final purpose to regenerate diseased and injured tissues\n3\n.  \n\nTERM is a field where a therapeutic strategy for IDD can be found, the doubt is not if \n\nit will work, but instead, how and when it will work. Indeed, many therapeutic strategies for \n\nIDD have been proposed within these two fields\n4\u20136\n\n, and although all of these have the same \n\npurpose, they use different ways to get there. Some research groups use cultured cells \n\ndirectly implanted in the native tissue, whether it is with nucleus pulposus (NP) cells \n\n(NPCs)\n7\n, annulus fibrosus (AF) cells (AFCs) and/or with stem cells\n\n8\u201311\n.  \n\nThe aim of the cell therapy strategies is to increase IVD\u2019s cell number levels and, \n\ntherefore, the extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Another treatment option relies on \n\nbiomolecules\u2019 injection\n12\n\n, which is intended to reduce the anabolic processes and increase the \n\ncatabolic processes to restore ECM levels. However, there are also other approaches that can \n\nbe taken for severe cases of IDD, regarding biomechanical dysfunction or lack of proper \n\nECM content in the IVD, using third generation biomaterials that can mimic the native \n\ntissue\u2019s physical and biochemical conditions\n13\n\n. These three strategies are the main ways \n\nwithin TERM fields to stop and revert IVD\u2019s degeneration process. They can be chosen \n\naccording with the IVD\u2019s stage of degeneration and type of malfunction, but probably, as \n\nmany research groups have been suggesting, the most adequate approach, at least for \n\nmoderate and severe cases of IDD, where IVD\u2019s biomechanics is about to or is already \n\ncompromised, would be a combination of two or all of these main regenerative strategies \n\n(e.g., a combination of scaffold with cells and bioactive molecules)\n14,15\n\n. \n\nBearing in mind that the world is in a difficult economic crisis and that getting enough \n\nfunding for science research, as in other areas, is harder; a question must be asked - Is \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nresearching an IVD\u2019s regeneration strategy economically worthwhile? To answer that \n\nquestion, it must be taken into account the size of the disease in terms of prevalence in \n\nsociety and its socioeconomic impact, which is statistically masked as LBP. So the \n\ndependence between LBP and IVD degeneration should be analysed. In fact, the IVD \n\ndegeneration is thought to be the primary cause of LBP, causing compression of the spinal \n\nnerves and adjacent vertebrae\n1,2\n\n. By the age of 50, 97% of the population show signs of IVD \n\ndegeneration\n16\n\n, which is a time bomb for LBP. The incidence of LBP increases with age, \n\ncreating a relationship between age related IVD degeneration and the frequency of LBP\n17\n\n. \n\nHaving in account the increasing lifetime average in first world countries, incidence of LBP \n\nis increasing with it. Considering the fact that modern lifestyle tends to fulfil some LBP\u2019s \n\nrisk factors, such as a large number of hours in a seated position, high levels of psychological \n\ndistress, low levels of physical activity, obesity or job dissatisfaction, and the relation \n\nbetween IDD and LBP shows the problem is far from solved. Other risk factors for LBP are \n\npoor knowledge about self-state of health, previous back pain, pain below the knee, \n\ndepression, fear avoidance behaviours, exposure to intense vibrations and smoking. \n\nThe most favourable way to analyse the economic importance/relevance of exploiting \n\na regenerative strategy for IDD, is to check how much money is spent directly or indirectly \n\n(money not won on labour or which is spent in consequences due to LBP, e.g., impairment \n\nand/or unemployment benefits) every year on treatments for LBP, and consider the \n\npercentage of LBP that is related to disc degeneration cases. Most LBP cases resolve rapidly \n\n(approximately 80-90% until the twelfth week with LBP symptom, acute LBP cases), but the \n\nremaining cases are the ones (from the twelfth week of LBP symptom forward is considered \n\nchronic LBP), which incur most of the treatment challenges and healthcare costs. In the \n\nUnited States, LBP is: the first cause of impairment in people younger than 45 years, the \n\nsecond cause to visit the physician, the third cause for surgical procedures and the fifth cause \n\nof admission in the hospital\n18\n\n. In the United Kingdom, LBP accounts for 13% of the \n\ncertificated sickness leave, with estimated indirect costs to the country of 9 billion euros per \n\nyear (in today\u2019s euro currency, X-Rates), and an annual direct cost to the National Health \n\nService of 900 M\u20ac (in today\u2019s euro currency, X-Rates)\n19\n\n. Resulting in 70 billion euros (in \n\ntoday\u2019s euro currency, X-Rates) in annual costs to alleviate and treat this pain\n1\n and it is \n\nrising. \n\nThis subject takes us to another question \u2013 Are there any good treatments for LBP? \n\nThe current treatments for LBP are therapies addressed for LBP, and not for its cause, which \n\nmeans, that these treatments are focused on treating only the symptoms, and do not solve the \n\nactual problem, e.g., IDD. The current treatments addressed to LBP, which largely include \n\nIDD\u2019s cases too, can be divided into pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies\n16\n\n. \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nThe pharmacological treatment options include anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants, \n\nantidepressants\n20\n\n, analgesics and opioids, and injection therapy (drug\u2019s injection). \n\nUnfortunately, most of these treatment approaches have the danger of promoting addiction. \n\nOn the other hand, the current treatments for chronic LBP are exercise, multidisciplinary \n\ntherapy as in physical and psychological training, massage (classical/Swedish muscle \n\nmassage)\n8\n, acupuncture\n\n21\n, behavioural therapy, back school, spinal manipulation\n\n22\n, \n\nelectromyographic biofeedback, lumbar supports, traction and transcutaneous electrical nerve \n\nstimulation. These are all treatments applied nowadays for patients with IDD, which are \n\ndiagnosed with LBP, and contribute for $90 billion annual costs applied directly in LBP \n\npatients\u2019, money that could be spent in good and efficient treatments, which do not exist still. \n\nNone of these treatments have shown already to be effective, sometimes it works, but it \n\nseems to depend on the cause of LBP, e.g., if a patient suffers from stress a muscle relaxant \n\ncan be enough to solve the condition. \n\nHerein, it is intended to address the basic anatomy and biomechanics of the spine and \n\nIVD, as well as the degeneration process of the IVD. It also overviews the state of the art \n\nregarding the repair strategies, gene therapy and TERM strategies developed to repair and \n\nregenerate the degenerated IVD. Other advanced strategies that have been exploited in new \n\nTE approaches are also discussed, which employs the use of reverse engineering (RE) and \n\nrapid prototyping (RP) technologies in order to prepare a patient-specific TE-total disc \n\nreplacement (TE-TDR) implant for middle to severe cases of IDD, e.g., cases in which the \n\nAF is already compromised. \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\n2. Spine: Anatomy and Function \n\n \n\nThe spine is composed of 33 vertebrae (9 are fused together in the sacrum and coccyx \n\nregions), most of them interspersed with IVDs, these being the biomechanical pivot of upper \n\nbody motion. This allows the spine to be in the upper right position, bend and be submitted \n\nto torsion at the same time as it protects the spinal cord from trauma\n23,24\n\n. The spine provides \n\nstrength and flexibility allowing the body to move in multiple spatial planes. The vertebrae \n\ncomposing the spine are numbered according to their spinal area location: 7 cervical (C1 to \n\nC7), 12 thoracic (T1 to T12), 5 lumbar (L1 to L5), 5 sacral (S1 to S5) and 4 coccygeal (fused \n\nvertebrae)\n25\n\n.  \n\nCervical area\u2019s main function is to support the head weight, which accounts for 8% of \n\ntotal bodyweight\n26\n\n. Thoracic area\u2019s range of motion is very limited and its main function is to \n\nprotect the chest\u2019s internal organs by supporting the thoracic cage. The lumbar area is \n\nresponsible for bearing the upper body\u2019s weight; for that reason, it has the biggest vertebrae \n\nin the entire spine. Vertebrae from both sacral and coccygeal areas are, each one, fused \n\ntogether. \n\nThe spine has a total of 24 IVDs, with approximately 4 cm in diameter and 7 to 10 mm \n\nthick (in the lumbar area), which account for one third of its height, and are the main \n\nresponsible for its flexibility. It also allows a variety of movements, namely in three different \n\nplanes: lateral bending, axial rotation and flexion-extension. When these motions are \n\naccompanied with heavy lifting, forces up to 17 kN can be created in the lumbar area\n27\n\n. In \n\nfact, this tissue is under high pressure when the body is in a vertical position, especially the \n\nlumbar area\u2019s discs, and even more when the body is in a seated position\n28\n\n. This indicates \n\nthat the modern lifestyle, regarding its tendency for higher number of hours in which a \n\nperson is seated, can be one more risk factor for chronic LBP and IVD degeneration. \n\nThe IVD is a complex structure composed of three different, although interdependent, \n\ntypes of tissue: (1) NP, (2) AF and (3) the cartilaginous endplates (CEP) (Figure 2.1)\n1\n located \n\non both top and down IVD extremities which vertically delimit the AF and the NP. The NP \n\nis the gelatinous core of the IVD, and is contained by the strong and elastic AF. \n\n \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Micro-computed tomography three-dimensional reconstruction of a rabbit IVD, \npresenting the different components, namely: NP in the middle, AF around the NP and both top and \n\ndown CEPs (Micro- computed tomography parameters: pixel size \u2013 13.18\u00b5m, source 89kV / 112\u00b5A). \n\n \n\nThe NP\u2019s hydrogel-like consistency is due to its proteoglycan (PG) and water content, \n\nheld loosely by a random network of collagen type II and elastin fibres. This structure has a \n\nhigh water content due to its high PG predominance in\n28\u201331\n\n which is about 80% and 65% (in \n\ndry weight), respectively at childhood, and drastically decreases with age\n3233\n\n. PGs are highly \n\nhydrophilic molecules, allowing them to adsorb large quantities of water, making NP\u2019s ECM \n\nto swell, giving the NP the classic hydrogel-like morphology. This morphology has \n\nviscoelastic properties, which is ideal for the NP function, and also ideal for the IVD\u2019s and \n\nspine\u2019s biomechanics. \n\nThe AF structure is responsible for contain the NP, and avoid its extrusion followed by \n\ncollapse, as NP is under high pressure and its consistency does not allow weight bearing on \n\nits own. The AF surrounds the NP with 10 to 25, extremely organized and highly fibrotic, \n\nannular elastic strips called lamellas\n28,31\n\n. Although collagen type II is also present in the AF \n\nas it is in the NP, the proportion is much smaller, on the other hand the presence of collagen \n\ntype I is highly predominant\n30\n\n. The collagen ratio of type I/type II increases from the NP\u2019s \n\ncentre until the AF\u2019s outer periphery. Actually, the AF varies so much radially that some \n\nresearch groups, including ours\n27\n\n and Cassinelli et al., say the IVD is composed by four \n\nstructures: CEP, NP, inner AF and outer AF\n17\n\n.  \n\nThe outer AF is the peripheral layer of the IVD (in the transverse plane), and it is \n\nhighly dense and organized\n17,27\n\n. The collagen fibres make a 60\u00ba angle with vertical axes, in \n\nthe same lamella they are parallel to each other, but alternated from adjacent fibres. All \n\ntogether, the lamellas make a diamond mesh-like force field to contain the NP. This \n\nconfiguration allows the outer AF to contain large forces coming from the compression of \n\nthe NP by the spine that are not contained by the inner AF\n30,31,34\n\n. \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nThe inner AF is a less organized structure than the outer AF. It is somehow a \n\ncombination between the outer AF and the NP both biochemically and biologically, although \n\nmore similar with the outer AF. On a healthy IVD the inner AF has a clear and smooth \n\nappearance. \n\nCEP divides both NP and AF from the adjacent vertebrae by covering the cortical \n\nbone\u2019s surface. Vertebrae are connected to the CEPs through calcium structures, in addition \n\nthe collagen fibres present in AF cross the border, tying the IVD to the vertebral bodies at its \n\nrim\n29\n\n. The CEP tissue is cartilaginous, and resembles articular cartilage in many properties. \n\nStudies have demonstrated that this tissue is the weakest of the three tissues in terms of \n\nmechanical properties\n30\n\n. \n\nThe IVD\u2019s mechanism works by using the best properties of each of its three main \n\ntypes of tissue: CEP, stiffness; NP, uniaxial into hydrostatic pressure converter; AF, elastic \n\nresilience. This characteristics work on a force transfer cascade which begins with the spine \n\nbeing mechanically requested, resulting in its compression\n35\u201338\n\n. The uniaxial compression \n\ndriven by this force is transferred through the CEPs to the NP, which reacts hydrostatically \n\ndue to its fluid properties. As a result the AF ends up being pushed from within \n\nhomogeneously, which reacts by containing it (Figure 2.2). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2. IVD\u2019s biomechanics general scheme, when the spine is mechanically requested. (Micro-\n\ncomputed tomography of rabbit IVD. Acquisition parameters: pixel size \u2013 13.18\u00b5m, source 89kV / \n\n112\u00b5A). \n\n \n\nThe assembled combination of both AF\u2019s and NP\u2019s mechanical properties make the \n\nIVD as it was composed of only one viscoelastic material ruled by two limit situations of \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nmaterial mechanics: elastic solid and viscous liquid. As so, it is possible to consider, that the \n\nIVD has both elastic solid and viscous liquid properties. \n\n  \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n3. Intervertebral Disc Degeneration (IDD) \n\n \n\nThe IVD suffers a great range of changes along the life of an individual - from the \n\nmolecular phenotype expression, to cell type, to tissues\u2019 (CEPs, AF and NP) morphology. \n\nAlongside with these changes, called aging process of the IVD, can be an underlying \n\nprogressing process of IDD. This disease can be triggered by an acute overloading (e.g., \n\nlifting a heavy object). With aging, the needed threshold loading, to initiate the disease, \n\nprogressively decreases. The degeneration of the disc converts the mild changes of aging \n\nIVD into serious conditions, e.g., water loss, ECM production activity and phenotype, among \n\nseveral other changes at the biomolecular level. Ultimately, these changes lead to severe \n\nmorphological changes, expressed in the form of pathologies. \n\nThe IVD biomechanical functioning relies on a balance between the three tissues that \n\ncompose it.  The same way the pressure goes along the CEPs to the NP, further to the AF, as \n\naforementioned; the water flow follows the same pattern. In young discs, the only existent \n\nvascularisation is located inside the CEPs, which provide hydration for the whole disc\n39\n\n. The \n\nwater is absorbed due to the osmotic pressure created by the biochemical components that \n\ncompose most of the NP. Therefore, during loading cycles where compression forces affect \n\nthe disc, the NP is strongly squeezed and the water molecules \u201cdetach\u201d from the PGs, \n\nflowing away through the AF tissue.  \n\nAs previously mentioned, the PGs are extremely hydrophilic molecules that are \n\nresponsible for the 80% water composition of the NP in young IVDs\n32\n\n. A combination of \n\nspine overloading with aging leads to NP\u2019s ECM remodeling unbalance, loss of hydration, \n\nIVD height decrease, abnormal force distribution, and, ultimately, leads to the appearance of \n\nIDD morphological signs\n40\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1. Pathophysiology  \n\n \n\nThompson et al. proposed a grading scale for the anatomical changes that happen \n\nalong the IDD development\n41\n\n. With the evolution of the IDD, there are a number of \n\npathophysiologic events that can develop with it, such as: annular tears, disc prolapse, end \n\nplate damage and Schmorl\u2019s nodes, internal disc disruption, discogenic pain, disc narrowing, \n\nradial bulging, and vertebral osteophytes\n42\n\n, which are addressed below. \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n3.1.1. Annular Tears \n\nThe annular tears (Figure 3.1) are protrusions of NP tissue into the AF. As the NP\u2019s \n\nmaterial characteristics change and the AF tissue\u2019s elastic properties weakens, with the help \n\nof an acute overloading recurrence on the spine, the NP is extruded through the AF and \n\ntherefore creating an annular tear. There are three types of annular tears: circumferential \n\ntears, peripheral tears, and radial fissures. Circumferential tears may evolve from acute \n\noverloading in older IVDs; the peripheral rim tears can be associated with trauma or with \n\nbony outgrowths, and are more frequent in the AF\u2019s anterior side; radial fissures are related \n\nwith IDD and may appear on both posterior or posterolateral sides\n43\n\n.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1. Annular tear in hernia stage. \n\n \n\nAnnular tears can be classified as contained or herniated, the last being when the NP is \n\nextruding out of the AF. From contained to herniated NP there are five levels of severity for \n\nthe annular tears progression, which is the gold standard for the computed tomography (CT) \n\nclassification of annular tears (Figure 3.2). Grade 0 refers to a normal health IVD; grade 1 is \n\nwhen the NP extrudes until the inner one-third of the AF; in grade 2 the NP leakage \n\nprogressed until two-thirds of the AF; when the NP finally completes the three-thirds of \n\nextrusion through the AF, but no more than that, is on the grade 3 of annular tear \n\nclassification; after the NP extruding beyond the AF outer border line the annular tear is on \n\nthe fourth grade; the last stage of the annular tear progression grading scale (grade 5) is when \n\nthe extrusion of the NP reaches the epidural space, that is when it may press the spinal nerve \n\nor one nerve ending, creating LBP\n44\n\n. \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2. Classification of annular tears first purposed by Sach et al. in 1990, which has been \n\nmodified by Bogduk et al. in 1992 and further modified by Schellhas et al. in 1996.  \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Disc Prolapse \n\nWhen the NP is totally extruded throughout the AF there is a disc prolapse. In fact, the \n\nAF does not have any significant compressive properties, it is an elastic tissue and it acts like \n\na rubber band when compressed, i.e., when it is submitted to traction it responds increasing \n\nthe reaction force the more it is stretched, however when compressed the middle part runs \n\naway towards one of the sides. Therefore, when there is no NP to convert the received force \n\ninto a hydrostatic pressure, the uniaxial compressive force is not contained and comes down \n\non the AF, which bends easily and it prolapses the disc. The difference between a disc \n\nherniation and a stage 5 annular tear is the quantity of NP content outside of place, if it is \n\ntotal then a disc prolapse (Figure 3.3) is about to or already did happen\n45\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3. Scheme of a prolapsed disc, emphasized in red. \n\n \n\n3.1.3. End Plate Damage and Schmorl\u2019s Nodes \n\nAnother typical IVD\u2019s pathology is CEP damage and the appearance of Schmorl\u2019s \n\nnodes. The CEPs are the weakest tissue of the three composing the IVD, in terms of \n\nmechanical properties\n30\n\n. In aged IVDs, when the CEPs already undergone a severe trabecular \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nmicrodamage, the tissue can suffer protrusion from the NP. The NP invades the vertebral \n\nbodies (Figure 3.4) and it ceases to be under pressure, since the force presses the AF instead, \n\nwhich cannot bear it and bends\n42\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4. NP protrusions (Schmorl\u2019s nodes) into the CEPs due to trabecular microdamage driven by \n\nNP biochemical imbalance. \n\n \n\n3.1.4. Internal Disc Disruption \n\nFinally, the loss of water inside the NP makes its volume decrease in almost 1:1 \n\nproportional ratio, since as much as 80% of the NP is water. The decrease of NP\u2019s volume \n\nhas a threshold, when this level is crossed the AF tissue seizes to be pushed by the NP. Since \n\nthe NP\u2019s height is smaller than the AF, the CEPs start to compress the AF instead of the NP. \n\nThe AF is not a hard tissue, thus it cannot hold compression in a functional way and internal \n\ndisc disruption occurs, dividing the AF into two layers that bend to different sides, in and \n\nout\n46\n\n. Due to AF organisational morphology, which is divided in radial lamellas, tends to \n\nbreak apart between 2 of the 15 to 25 lamella stripes that compose the whole AF. This event \n\ncreates a gap inside the AF, which significantly decreases the tissues mechanical \n\nperformance, thus contributing to the progression of degeneration\n47\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Biological and Molecular Changes  \n\n \n\nBiological and molecular changes underlie the morphological signs of IDD. Regarding \n\nbiological changes, the cells present in degenerating IVDs suffer changes in several domains. \n\nZhao et al.\n48\n\n made an extensive review on the cellular changes that happen during IDD. The \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nauthors claim that there are cell changes in: type, density, death, proliferation, senescence, \n\nand phenotype. All these changes have an impact on molecular synthesis, which leads to an \n\nunbalanced ECM remodeling, and ultimately to loss of hydration that should be about 80%\n30\n\n. \n\nThe IVD is composed of different types of cells in its different parts. The CEP as in \n\nresemblance to the hyaline cartilage is composed by chondrocytes; the outer AF is populated \n\nby elongated fibroblastic-like cells; the inner AF as more rounded chondrocyte-like cells. \n\nThe cell population in CEP and AF does not change much with aging, however, it does vary \n\ngreatly in the NP\n48\n\n. The CEP and the whole AF as most of the spinal structures are derived \n\nfrom the mesoderm germ layer, but not the NP\n49\n\n. This tissue on the other hand, has its origin \n\non the endoderm germ layer that is also the notochordal cell\u2019s origin. These cells are largely \n\npresent in young discs, but disappear by the end of the first decade of life. The notochordal \n\ncells (NCs) are gradually replaced by chondrocyte-like cells which are believed to migrate \n\nfrom the inner AF and/or from the CEPs\n29\n\n. \n\nThere is some controversy around cell density changes. Zhao et al.\n48\n\n believe the cell \n\ndensity has its turnovers in parallel with the change of cell type in the NP. As NCs start to \n\ndisappear, the cell density drops creating a positive feedback for chondrocyte-like cells \n\nmigration and proliferation into the NP tissue, coming from the already mentioned tissues. \n\nThese chondrocyte-like cells increase density along IDD. Bae et al. do not agree though, they \n\nclaim that the degenerated disc\u2019s cell density is lower than that found in healthy discs\n50\n\n. But \n\nboth hypotheses have strong arguments, as degeneration process progresses the CEPs start to \n\ncalcify and IVD\u2019s vascular access starts to become scarce affecting the cells\u2019 nutritional \n\nroute and cellular waste removal, causing increased cell death (Figure 3.5). However, with \n\nIDD progression, ingrowth of blood vessels accompanied by nerve growth occurs into the \n\nAF and even into the NP (in advanced IDD)\n51\n\n. These changes increase nutritional \n\naccessibility and waste removal rate, which can increase as well the cell density in the NP. \n\nBut with nutritional availability also oxygen concentration increases inside the IVD, even \n\nmore than in healthy IVDs. NPCs phenotype and activity is stimulated by hypoxia, \n\nultimately the excessive availability to oxygen leads to normoxia, which tends to make NPCs \n\nsenescent\n52,53\n\n. \n\n \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\n \n\n Figure 3.5. Scheme of the cascade of events associated with the morphological signs of IDD. \n\n \n\nThe cellular change, potentially most responsible for the morphological \n\ntransformations observed due to IDD, is the NPC phenotype. Cell expression has direct \n\ninfluence in the anabolic-catabolic ECM pathway balance, as IDD progresses the catabolism \n\nincreases in relation to anabolism, i.e., the matrix is more degraded than it is produced. In a \n\nnormal IVD, the AF is largely composed of collagen type I whereas the NP is composed of \n\ncollagen type II and aggrecan, which is a type of PG. But other molecules are present in the \n\nNP, such as: collagen type I, III, V, VI, IX and XI, biglycans, decorin and fibromodulin \n\n(other types of PGs), and fibronectin\n30\n\n. In healthy IVDs there is also production of catabolic \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nmolecules with increased expression while IDD progresses. These molecules are matrix \n\nmetalloprotainases (MMPs) and aggrecanases, which break down the ECM. There are \n\nseveral types of MMPs expressed in the NP: type 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 and 13. In addition to that, \n\nthere is also an increased cytokine production, such as: interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-1? and tumour \n\nnecrosis factor-?. These molecules also promote the MMPs synthesis, having a devastating \n\neffect on the ECM\n34\n\n. Zhao et al. summarized a table of the biochemical changes caused by \n\nthe IDD, which complements this brief description of ECM remodeling mediation\n48\n\n. \n\nThe biomolecular changes throughout the IVD decrease the concentration of \n\nhydrophilic molecules in the NP. This has a strong effect on the IVD\u2019s permeability that \n\nwhen affected can change the IVD\u2019s biomechanics. NP\u00b4s hydraulic permeability greatly \n\ndepends on the magnitude of the compression force made on the disc. Heneghan et al.\n54\n\n \n\ndefined a mathematical formula explaining this phenomenon, which is given by equation 1. \n\n?(?) = 2.05 \u00d7 10?15(? ? 0.2)1.13? ?0.01(?\n2?1)       (Equation 1) \n\n \n\nWhere, k, is the named permeability and, ?, is the stretch ratio, i.e., the ratio between \n\nthe compressed sample\u2019s height and the original height, on the apparatus used by this \n\nresearch group. In which, an IVD is submitted to a compression strain and the flow inlet and \n\noutlet are measured. This experiment besides giving a relation between permeability and \n\ncompression, also shows that this relation does not follow a linear tendency but, instead \n\nfollows an exponential tendency (? = h / h0, as h0 is the uncompressed height of the IVD and \n\nis always higher than h, which is the compressed height of the NP; therefore, ? is always \n\nbetween 0 and 1). Until a certain level of NP compression magnitude (? ? 0.2), the tissue is \n\nnot permeable, i.e., when k = 0 or is an imaginary value. But this formula can only be applied \n\nwhen the NP is healthy, since when the degeneration starts the PG number decreases inside \n\nthe NP and its permeability increases with it, i.e., the water retention decreases and the whole \n\nIVD decreases its mechanical performance. This process is a cycle, with loss of \n\nbiomechanical properties the typical loading starts to become an overloading, which also is a \n\nfactor to progress the degeneration state that will in the end reduce even more the mechanical \n\ncapacity, and the cycle goes on in a recessive spiral. \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\n4. Treatment Strategies for Intervertebral Disc Repair/Regeneration \n\n \n\nAs previously stated, current treatments for LBP can cause addiction and only treat the \n\nsymptoms. These treatments only work in specific situations, like in acute IVD traumas or in \n\nthe beginning of the IDD\u2019s appearance. They mainly work by taking pressure out of the IVD \n\n(e.g., muscle relaxants soften muscle strain over the IVD) thereby allowing the natural \n\nregeneration mechanism to solve the issue by itself. However, most of these treatments \n\nmerely neutralize or reduce the patient\u2019s pain, while the IDD is still progressing\n40\n\n. \n\nIn more severe cases of IDD, the natural regeneration system cannot cope anymore, \n\neither by itself or with strain releasing help (such as current treatments for LBP, e.g., \n\nmassage). In that case, only three strategies have the potential to remove pain completely, \n\nwhich are repair\n55\n\n, gene therapy\n56\n\n and TERM strategies\n57\n\n. The first intends to solve IDD with \n\nartificial implants, whereas the second and third aim at the total regeneration of a patient\u2019s \n\nIVD, removing all previous signs of degeneration. \n\nEven though gene therapy is still far away from clinical application, it promises great \n\nresults in the future, not only in IVD regeneration, but also in several different kinds of \n\ndiseases e.g., cystic fibrosis\n58\n\n. The question of which one of these strategies is the best, \n\ncannot be answered yet, mainly due to the fact that there is still no clinically-approved IVD \n\nregeneration strategy available, despite promising potential in the currently researched \n\ntreatment options\n59\n\n. Now, patients can only choose repair strategies as an alternative to \n\ncurrent treatments in order to treat IDD. \n\nIn this section, it will be discussed the several repair approaches. Starting with the \n\ndiscectomy procedure, with its objective to remove the LBP generated by extruded NP \n\nmaterial that compresses the peripheral spinal nerve or the spinal cord. This section gives a \n\nresume of some repair device strategies that not only remove LBP, but prevent it from \n\ncoming back due to re-herniation after discectomy. Furthermore, the spinal fusion procedure \n\nis briefly explained, and how it treats IDD by removing the source of pain, preventing any \n\npossibility of it coming back. Well, at least in that intervertebral space, since herein it is also \n\ndiscussed how this procedure can stimulate adjacent IVDs to degenerate due to \n\nbiomechanical imbalance through the spine after spinal fusion.  \n\nMoreover, TERM strategies to treat IDD in the NP are described and what pathways \n\nsome research groups are taking to achieve that goal. This can be made whether by finding \n\npotential ways of differentiating stem cells into NPCs or by culturing isolated NPCs with \n\ngrowth factors (GFs) or serum-free chemically defined medium to make them metabolically \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nactive. Then, which materials have been giving more interesting results to carry NPCs in the \n\ndegenerated NP. Furthermore, it will be discussed which strategies are being followed \n\nnowadays to regenerate the AF, since without a good support, whether native or scaffold, for \n\nthe NP, this will herniate on the first loading cycle. But to find the right material to mimic \n\nthe complex mechanical properties of the AF is not an easy task, since it is a very efficiently \n\norganized tissue. And the synthesis of this ECM organization must, as well, be stimulated \n\nand timed with the scaffold rate of degradation. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1. Repair Strategy  \n\n \n\n4.1.1. Discectomy/Arthrodesis \n\nSurgical methods for degenerative lumbar conditions include discectomy, arthrodesis \n\nor a combination of both. Discectomy is the surgical removal of NP fragments following \n\nherniation that compresses the spinal nerve. This compression distribution on the affected \n\nnerve causes pain, sensory changes, or weakness\n60,61\n\n. Discectomy is successful in relieving \n\nthe radicular pain caused by the herniated disc. However, this procedure alone is unable to \n\nrestore the nucleus to its original load sharing capacity, which controversially affects long-\n\nterm benefits and re-herniation rates. Moreover, discectomy may accelerate the progression \n\nof disc degeneration by damaging the AF, which in turn will lead to a decrease in NP \n\npressure, decreasing the disc height, impairing the disc\u2019s ability to rehydrate, and increasing \n\nthe AF stresses and strains\n61\n\n. Besides the anatomical problems, the removal of the \n\ndegenerated or damaged disc tissue typically provokes negative biomechanical changes\n1,60\n\n. \n\nFurthermore, it is unknown whether the effect of discectomy depends on the degenerative \n\nstate of the disc\n61\n\n. \n\nDue to the disadvantages and limited success of discectomy procedures in general, \n\narthrodesis was developed as an alternative method within clinical treatments. Arthrodesis, \n\nalso known as spinal fusion, has been practiced since the beginning of the 20\nth\n century. \n\nSpinal fusion involves the use of bone tissue, traditionally derived from autografts, allografts, \n\nas well as the application of demineralized bone matrix, ceramics, and more recently bone \n\nmorphogenetic proteins to bridge two or more vertebrae\n62\n\n. This procedure aims at stabilizing \n\nthe moving segment, and slowing the progression of disc degeneration and relative \n\npathological motion between vertebrae. Arthrodesis is based on the hypothesis that the \n\nmechanical and environmental changes will relieve the pain\n63,64\n\n. Even though spinal fusion is \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\na common procedure, its efficacy in treating discogenic LBP has been resulted in conflicting \n\nresults\n65\n\n. Long-term consequences such as adjacent segment disease have increased concerns \n\nfor the use of spinal fusion\n1\n. Furthermore, several changes have been observed such as \n\ndehydration, disc space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and progressive deformity at levels \n\nadjacent to a fused spinal segment\n66\n\n.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Replacement \n\nIn an effort to improve results of fusion and to decrease the incidence of adjacent IVD \n\ndegeneration, TDR techniques have been introduced and studied extensively. \n\nArtificial disc replacement (nucleus and annulus) technology was first considered in \n\nthe early 1950\u2019s to produce an implant that could mimic, to some extent, the function of the \n\nnormal IVD (maintain the mobility of the intervertebral motion segment and restoring \n\nnatural disc function)\n62,67\n\n. Moreover, implants for disc replacement should be biocompatible, \n\ndurable, and easily implantable\n68\n\n. There are generally two types of disc arthroplasty devices, \n\nwhich are nucleus replacement or TDR devices, with the latter being more frequently used\n1\n.  \n\nNucleus substitutes are aimed at restoring disc height and returning annular fibres to \n\ntheir natural length. Adding to the appeal is the minimally invasive nature of this treatment \n\nmethod\n69\n\n. However, despite minimal invasion, a passage through the annulus for the \n\nprosthesis has to be created. Nevertheless, this approach allows the rehabilitation of the \n\nnormal load distribution among the nucleus, the annulus and the facet joints, as well as \n\npromoting the healing of the annulus and thwart degeneration by themselves.  \n\nIn general, the substitute should provide resistance to pressure with position change \n\nrecreating the disc \u201cbellows\u201d effect\n60\n\n. A wide range of materials has been tried in order to \n\nreplace the nucleus of the IVD, including: polymethylmethacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol \n\n(PVA)/polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) copolymer, polycarbonate urethane, albumin, silicon, \n\nand stainless steel\n62\n\n. The most well-known device is the prosthetic disc nucleus, which is \n\ncomprised of two sections: the first is made up of a non-degradable hydrogel pellet \n\n(polyacrylamide) and the second, which surrounds the hydrogel, is a polymer mesh or jacket \n\ncomposed of polyethylene\n70\n\n. However, in advanced stages of degeneration, these devices \n\ncannot be applied and TDR becomes again the most favourable approach.  \n\nTDR aims at restoring the physiological kinematics of the IVD, such as resisting wear \n\nand relieving pain, while avoiding instability and protecting the adjacent discs and facet \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\njoints from undue degeneration\n62\n\n. Three artificial disc options have been proposed for TDR: \n\nmetallic, non-metallic, or a combination of both materials\n27\n\n. SB-Charit\u00e9\n\u00ae\n, a metal-\n\npolyethylene-metal construct was the first total disc arthroplasty, which is still in use today \n\nfollowing only minor changes to the original design. Pro-disc\n\u00ae\n is another prosthesis that has \n\nbeen widely used\n71\n\n. \n\nEach artificial disc is composed of two or three components, which include two \n\nendplates and an articulating mechanism with either a metal-on-metal or metal-on-polymer \n\nsurface. In order to keep the disc in place and provide stability within the host vertebral \n\nbody, devices feature different designs - teeth-like compounds fixed into the vertebral bone; \n\na porous coated surface onto the endplates, which promotes the growth of fibrous tissue \n\naround the device; or implant securing with screws into the recipient vertebral body\n27,72\n\n. \n\nEven though theoretically appealing, there are several challenges with current TDR strategies \n\nand also there is insufficient data to assess the performance of IVD arthroplasty adequately. \n\nDespite being in use for at least the last 20 years, there are some concerns regarding the \n\nsafety and efficacy of these methods\n73\n\n. Consequently, patients may require revision surgery, \n\nwhich may be very dangerous due to the adjacent great vessels and the nerve plexus. Another \n\nsolution, posterior fusion, requires the removal of the disc prosthesis followed by spinal \n\nfusion to immobilize the affected tissue, which again is very risky and dangerous\n1,73\n\n. \n\nRegarding the obvious downfalls of spinal fusion, the development of dynamic, or \n\nsemi rigid-, constructs for lumbar spine instrumentation has emerged as an alternative option. \n\nThis method is based on a load-sharing device, allowing for fusion without excessive \n\nrigidity, which, if disregarded, may lead to adjacent segment complications\n74\n\n. Some dynamic \n\nconstructs have also been used without fusion\n75\n\n. Several authors have reported that posterior \n\ndynamic instrumentation, compared to rigid instrumentation, increases the amount of load \n\ntransmitted through the anterior column and the interbody bone graft, which will avoid \n\nstress-shielding phenomena. Consequently, this may favour osteogenesis and enhance \n\ninterbody fusion in accordance with Wolff\u2019s Law, which states that bone will adapt to the \n\nload it is placed under through piezoelectric phenomena\n74\n\n. \n\nSystems for spinal fusion can be described as pedicle screw\u2013based constructs that are \n\nsemi-rigid, or allow constrained motion in compression or flexion and extension. Pedicle \n\nscrew-based systems are classically divided into semi-rigid rod systems and tension band-\n\nbased posterior systems used in non-fusion technology\n74\n\n. The rigidity of these constructs \n\ndepends on the material and design of the rods, which are connecting the pedicle screws. \n\nAlthough, solid stainless steel and titanium are commonly used in spinal fusion constructs\n76\n\n, \n\nthe semi-rigid constructs often include polyetheretherketone (PEEK) rods\n77\n\n, nitinol rods\n78\n\n, \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nespecially cut rods (e.g., Accuflex), articulated rods, and polyethylene terephthalate cords \n\n(Dynesys)\n75,79\n\n. \n\nUnlike the aforementioned prostheses that are fixed to the vertebrae by the use of \n\npedicle screws, there are \u201cfloating devices\u201d, which are interspinous implants. These implants \n\nhave the advantage of reducing the risk of implant loosening during motion\n80\n\n.  \n\nDuring the last decade, spinal cage implantation has gained a lot of attention. This \n\napproach enhances spinal fusion and stability in cervical spine surgery, ensuring, at the same \n\ntime, an adequate increase in the height and helping to correct cervical kyphosis, i.e., a \n\ncurvature in the cervical area of the spine\n81\n\n. PEEK cages have recently been used in cervical \n\nsurgery, since they provide both strength and stiffness in the intervertebral space. A major \n\nadvantage of these implants is their radio transparency and magnetic resonance imaging \n\n(MRI) compatibility, which are traditionally used in the visualization of the spinal cord and \n\nthe root. Since the polymer is radiolucent, visualization in the aforementioned methods can \n\nbe performed without the generation of implant artefacts in the resulting images\n81\n\n.  \n\nFinally, intradiscal electrothermal therapy is a percutaneous technique reported by Saal \n\net al., and it is another option for the treatment of discogenic LBP\n82\n\n. A navigable \n\nelectrothermal catheter is inserted inside the posterior annulus, which delivers heat. The \n\nproposed mechanism of action of this technique is collagen modulation, cauterization of \n\ngranulation tissue, deactivation of inflammatory agents and possibly annular denervation. \n\nThe heat induces the retraction of the annular collagen (collagen fibrils shrink at \n\ntemperatures greater than 60\u00baC), therefore coagulating inflammatory tissue and nerve \n\nendings in the periphery of the disc\u2019s posterior side\n82\n\n. This heating method has been shown \n\nto produce temperatures sufficient to cause nerve fibre death as well as collagen \n\ndenaturation\n83\n\n. Moreover, there are no biomechanical modifications and destabilizations after \n\napplying this procedure. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. Gene Therapy  \n\n \n\nA potential therapeutic strategy next to the classic LBP management treatments and \n\nrepair strategies is the gene therapy. This possibility was first thought as a way of treating \n\nchronic diseases, targeting the problem on its core by modifying, adding or disabling a gene \n\nor a cocktail of genes. Several problems occurred, when it was first tested; unfortunately the \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nidea gained a bad reputation and gone into a research standby for a decade\n84\n\n. Recently, the \n\nnumber of groups researching gene therapy started rising again, being nowadays a possibility \n\nof stopping and reverting degeneration of the IVD. \n\nThe first question when applying this strategy for IVD regeneration is \u2013 what should \n\nchange on a molecular level, to stop and revert IVD\u2019s degeneration? As it has been explained \n\nabove, the malfunction in the NP\u2019s ECM production and maintenance is one of the main \n\nreasons for the IVD to fail biomechanically. So, the strategy must be focused on balancing \n\nthe catabolic-anabolic equilibrium into the ECM production side. For that, two things can be \n\ndone, alone or together, increase the ECM anabolism and decrease the catabolic pathway. \n\nThis can be done by transfecting the right genes into the NPC population, genes that codify \n\npotential therapeutic GFs and cytokines such as: transforming GF (TGF)-?1, TGF-?3, insulin \n\nlike GF-1, osteogenic protein-1, IL-1, bone morphogenic protein-2, latent membrane protein-\n\n1, SOX9, among others\n85\n\n. Transfecting a combination of these genes would increase ECM \n\nproduction, but the reverse strategy can also show equally positive results, by silencing \n\ntargeted catabolic proteins using RNA interference, such as proteolytic enzymes (e.g., MMPs \n\nand disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs). This RNA suppresses \n\nthe overall production of the targeted gene by using a small interfering RNA, which binds \n\nspecifically to the gene\u2019s mRNA sequence, leading to a suppressed translation or increased \n\nmRNA\u2019s degradation\n86,87\n\n. \n\nAfter choosing the proper cocktail of genes to be delivered, another question may be \n\nposed - how does the gene reach its final destination? With few exceptions naked DNA alone \n\nis not a feasible way to deliver it to target the cells\u2019 nucleus; a vector is needed that can be \n\nviral or non-viral. Non-viral vectors are systems, which do not have viral origin, such as \n\nliposomes\n88\n\n, DNA-ligand complexes\n89\n\n, gene gun\n90\n\n and microbubble enhanced ultrasound\n91\n\n. \n\nHowever, the non-viral vectors give the host a transient gene expression that is not suitable \n\nfor the treatment of chronic diseases. A longer lasting strategy must be applied, for that, viral \n\nvectors are the most favourable since they use viral\u2019s natural way of infecting the host and \n\nintegrating DNA into the target cells\u2019 genome, e.g., metabolism senescent cells like the ones \n\npresent inside the IVD in order to enhance their activity. Viral vectors, on the other hand, \n\nbring the risk of alarming the immune system that is a huge issue in high-vascularised \n\ntissues, which is not the case as the IVD is the most avascular tissue in the body. Viral \n\nvectors utilized for gene therapy applications include adenovirus\n92\n\n, adeno-associated virus\n93\n\n, \n\nherpes simplex virus\n94\n\n, lentivirus and retrovirus\n95\n\n. \n\nIn addition to the selection of the appropriate gene and vector, another important \n\nconsideration with gene therapy applications is the delivery strategy. There are two main \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nstrategies for gene delivery as proposed by Nishida et al\n96\n\n, in vivo and ex vivo (Figure 4.1). \n\nThe first strategy takes fewer steps than the second, it involves the direct transfer of the \n\nvector-gene complex into the target tissue within the living host. The ex vivo strategy \n\ninvolves a more complex approach. First the cells are isolated from the host; after the culture \n\nis transfected with the desired DNA material; the cells, which were successfully genetically \n\nmodified, are then implanted into the desired tissue. This strategy seems to be much safer, \n\nsince while cells remain in vitro they can be assessed before implantation in order to control \n\nwhat goes inside the patient\u2019s organism; so those cells that had a bad reaction to the \n\ntransfection can be removed, and only the desired cells are implanted\n97\n\n. Also, the in vitro \n\nculture required in ex vivo strategies may change cells characteristics in a way that they \n\ncannot survive in the harsh environment observed in a degenerated NP (low oxygen, low pH, \n\npoor nutrition)\n98\n\n. Mimicking the IVD\u2019s conditions is needed in order to reproduce in vitro, as \n\nmuch as possible, the IVD\u2019s cell environment, and probably the only possible strategy is to \n\nproceed with the culture in a bioreactor. On the other hand, the in vivo strategy has its \n\ndisadvantages as well, using this approach the viral vectors are injected with an unknown \n\nconcentration in comparison with the cells present in the target tissue. This relation between \n\nthe number of viral particles and target cells is called multiplicity of infection, which in high \n\nvalues is extremely cytotoxic\n52\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1. Gene delivery strategy available, A. in vivo \u2013 which implants the vector-gene complex \n\nwithin the living host \u2013 and B. ex vivo \u2013 which involves isolation of the host target cells (1\nst\n and 2\n\nnd\n \n\nsteps), transfection (3\nrd\n\n step) and implantation (4\nth\n\n step). \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nThe literature is controversial about which delivery strategy is the most proper \n\nstrategy, further research is needed to unveil this topic, however, it seems relatively easy to \n\nconclude that the in vivo strategy, although more dangerous, seems more efficient. \n\nThe IDD can be a severely debilitating disease, but it can never be fatal. For that \n\nreason only, a treatment, such as gene therapy can be seen as an extremist strategy, since, \n\nalthough the disease will not kill, the cure can, as well as stimulate IDD to an even more \n\ndebilitating condition (e.g., paralysis)\n99\n\n. In fact, gene therapy can achieve great result without \n\nbeing too invasive, but only if everything goes according to plan, otherwise (e.g., high \n\nmultiplicity of infection, injection made in a vascular vessel or in a nerve ending) there is a \n\nreal risk of killing the patient. Anyway, there are no better treatments, only appropriate \n\ntreatments, and with more research, gene therapy can have a place as an IDD therapy. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3. Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Strategies Applied to \n\nthe Regeneration of Intervertebral Disc  \n\n \n\nSince Langer and Vacanti first defined TE as \u201can interdisciplinary field of research \n\nthat applies the principles of engineering and life sciences towards the development of \n\nbiological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function\u201d\n100\n\n the research field \n\nwent into an exponential growth. Its close companion field, RM, is going good as well since \n\nit was recently declared by The Economist as \u201cthe best market in the world right now\u201d\n101\n\n. \n\nTERM are definitely two potential areas to find treatment strategies that can cure diseases \n\nthat until now did not have an effective cure\n3\n. While RM targets diseases in which the main \n\nproblem is in the cellular population, the TE addresses diseases in an advanced state of \n\ndegeneration in which, or for any other reason (e.g., tissue surgically removed for treating \n\ncancer), the tissue\u2019s mechanical stability has been compromised.  \n\nIn the case of the IDD disease, TE (Figure 4.2) aims to restore disc height and \n\nbiomechanical stability by repairing the tissue at first\n102\n\n. Through time the scaffold degrades \n\nand becomes bioactive, sprouting back the body\u2019s natural regeneration process that without a \n\nphysical support provided by the biomaterial would not be possible. This grants a favourable \n\nenvironment for cells to produce not just ECM, but the right type of matrix. Cells need to be \n\nin contact with each other in order to produce the right ECM for it to be the aimed tissue. On \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nthe other hand, for that tissue to be grown the cells must be at the density that its cell type is \n\nused to, not only that, but also the rate of nutrient supply and cellular waste removal should \n\nbe similar to the native tissue. The situation is similar regarding oxygen supply and carbon \n\ndioxide removal\n103\n\n. These parameters are very important, especially for the IVD, since this is \n\nthe most avascular tissue in the human body. The same presence of nerve endings in the IVD \n\nis also extremely limited, which explains the lack of symptoms until a severe state of IDD\n104\n\n. \n\nTherefore, NPCs are not used to be close to a blood vessel that provides higher concentration \n\nnutrients and oxygen. All of this influences the cell\u2019s type and what they express, as \n\nexplained before, having a direct impact in the functional stability of the tissue.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2. Scheme of a Tissue Engineering strategy applied to the intervertebral disc. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Nucleus Pulposus \n\nThe genesis of IDD is related to the loss of ECM in the NP\u2019s (Figure 2.2). The main \n\nreason for the appearing of this disease, besides it may arise due to an acute overloading of \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nthe spine or ageing, is in the loss of water within the NP matrix. Since 80% of its content is \n\nwater, a decrease in its content lead to a decrease in NP height and consequently it loses its \n\nbiomechanical functionality\n32\n\n. When regenerating the NP this high water content must be \n\nmaintained, therefore the hydrogels seem like the ideal candidate to mimic the native tissue \n\ndue to their ability to retain water, some up to 98%\n105\n\n. \n\nCell-based strategies aimed to regenerate the IVD concern strictly on renewing the \n\nsynthesis of NP\u2019s ECM by cell injection in order to increase cell number, but more \n\nimportantly to boost the active cell population. This because the reason why the ECM is lost \n\nis due to the native NPCs\u2019 change in behaviour, they seize to produce PGs at an even rate as \n\nthe ECM remodelling proteins destroy it\n50\n\n. The NPCs living inside IVDs that are in an \n\nadvanced state of degeneration are senescent and need to be replaced with strong and \n\nvigorous ECM cell producers. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.1.1. Matrices: Biomaterials/Scaffolds \n\nRegarding regeneration treatment strategies for IDD, when the subject is cell-based \n\nstrategies it is implied that only the NP tissue is being regenerated. This because in IDD \n\nprocess the AF degenerates after the NP, in fact the AF degenerates mainly because of NP \n\nmalfunction, due to its degenerated state\n106\n\n. So when choosing the right biomaterial to carry \n\ncells to the NP, several properties must be taken in account, as described in Table 4.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nTable 4.1. Hydrogel requirements as NPCs carrier. \n\n Problem Solution References \n\n1 \n\nAF should be left intact as much as \n\npossible during surgical procedure \n\nInjectable material, so that only the area \n\nof the needle\u2019s section is hurt on the \n\nAF\u2019s \n\n107\n \n\n2 \n\nIn order to achieve the first \n\nrequirement, the material must be \n\nable to polymerise only when inside \n\nthe NP. * \n\nThis polymerization can respond either \n\nto pH, ion interaction, temperature, or \n\neven light. \n\n108,109\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nIf the material is going to carry the \n\ncells to the NP it should improve the \n\nNP\u2019s properties, such as disc height \n\nand biomechanical function, in order \n\nfor the cells to remain viable. \n\nThe material\u2019s mechanical properties \n\nshould be as close as possible with the \n\nmechanical properties of the NP \n\ntissue. \n\n110\n \n\n4 \n\nProvide an environment that \n\nstimulates NPC\u2019s phenotype. \n\nThe material must be able to absorb a \n\nlot of water, at least 80%, which is the \n\namount of water inside the NP.  \n\n32\n \n\n5 \nThe material besides biocompatible \n\nshould be biodegradable. \n\nThe degradability rate must match the \n\ntissue\u2019s rate of regeneration. \n\n111\n \n\n*If the polymerised material is able to be injected or if the material does not polymerise in vivo it is very \n\nlikely that the material will come right off through the needle hole, with cells included, on the first IVD \n\nloading. \n\n \n\nWith all those properties in mind, the type of material that stands out is the hydrogel \n\n(Figure 4.3). Hydrogels are polymeric networks with the capacity of absorbing water from 10 up \n\nto 100 times its dry weight. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3. Methacrylated gellan gum discs with a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 5 mm. Scale bar: \n\n10 mm. \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nSeveral kinds of hydrogels have been studied for cartilage regeneration, as well as \n\nspecifically prepared for IVD TE strategies. Hydrogels belong to the group of polymeric \n\nmaterials, thus they can be divided into two types regarding their origin \u2013 natural and \n\nsynthetic\n112\n\n. \n\nThere is a growing interest in natural origin hydrogels, and the economic aspect is the \n\nmain reason for it. As most of the naturally occurring hydrogels are extracted and not \n\nsynthesised, this greatly reduces its manufacturing cost. In that sense, they also require \n\npurification processing, which sometimes involves using severely toxic solvents and reagents. \n\nEven so, in general, they are less expensive to produce than synthetic hydrogels. Other reasons \n\nfor why they are getting more attractive might be their low level of cytotoxicity and their wide \n\nrange of possible TE applications, such as: bioactive degradation, available to cellular \n\nremodelling, cell adherent, and biological signalling\n113\u2013115\n\n. \n\nAlthough natural origin hydrogels offer a wide range of biological advantages, they \n\ngenerally lack the needed physical properties, as solubility and accelerated rate of degradation \n\ndo not allow the tissue to regenerate in such low time. This does not suit cartilage regeneration, \n\nsince they have a long regeneration time\n116\n\n. Therefore, if a natural originated hydrogel as these \n\nproperties suited for cartilage then it\u2019s a very promising material. Some examples are: \n\nalginate\n117\n\n, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), chitosan, collagen, gellan gum (GG), and \n\nhyaluronic acid (HA) (Table 4.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nTable 4.2.

This hydrogels \n\nprovide predictable and reproducible chemical and physical properties that can be tuned for \n\ndifferent TE applications, e.g., degradation rate according to the aimed tissue regeneration rate. \n\nMoreover, they are easy to blend with polymers that broaden even more the properties\u2019 \n\npossibilities of synthetic origin hydrogels\n125\n\n. Since they are made of well-known molecules, \n\nwhen pure, they have a low risk of immunogenicity, infection and toxicity\n115,126\n\n. Though, they \n\nlack bioactivity, and their manufacture is, in general, economically unattractive. Some examples \n\nof synthetic hydrogels for IVD TE strategies are: polyethylene glycol (PEG)\n127\n\n, PVA\n128\n\n and \n\nPVP\n129\n\n (Table 4.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.1.2. Cells \n\nCell therapy approach for IVD regeneration is based on injecting NP phenotype cells that \n\nare believed to produce PGs when in situ. Thus, the first obstacle is - what type of cells is the \n\nright one to be used? Well, if the native NPCs (Figure 4.4) are to be replaced they surely cannot \n\nbe used, i.e., the NPCs from the degenerated IVD cannot be used since they are senescent or \n\nthey are not expressing the right phenotype. \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4. Micrographs of human NPCs after 3 days in culture. Scale bar: 50 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\nFortunately, it is possible for this to be a wrong statement in the near future, since Rosalin \n\nAbbott and her co-workers\n12\n\n have been working on increasing human NPCs\u2019 metabolic activity, \n\nproliferation, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production, and stimulate non-degenerated NPC\u2019s \n\nphenotype. They believe that native NPCs from an IVD in a severe state of degeneration have, \n\nin fact, a hidden regenerative potential. The exposer of these type of cells to a notochordal \n\nconditioned media and/or GFs, namely from the TGF family, constitutes a promising strategy to \n\nenhance GAG production and be an effective treatment. They retrieved the cells from a human \n\nsource and after expanding them under the aforementioned conditions they were implanted in \n\nIDD rabbit models (induced by needle-punctures).The results showed not only that cells stayed \n\nviable for up to 24 weeks but also that this strategy delayed the IDD progression.  \n\nJennifer Maier\n130\n\n studied the effects of Foxa1 and Foxa2 genes n the notochordal sheet \n\nformation during embryogenesis, and found out that in fact they do have an indispensable role \n\nin NP tissue formation. It is believed, that the young NP tissue does not have the chondrocyte-\n\nlike NPCs, but only NC cells, and the chondrocyte migrate from the inner AF tissue or from the \n\nCEPs\n131\n\n. There is the possibility that stem cell transfection with Foxa1 and Foxa2 could guide \n\nthe differentiation line to NC cells, but it is a very premature statement, with the potential to be \n\nresearched, though. \n\nThe prospect of using stem cells in cell-based strategies for IVD regeneration brings with \n\nit the necessary step of differentiating stem cells into fully functional NPCs. Although this is not \n\nan easy task, recent efforts (e.g., induced pluripotent stem cells)\n132\n\n have been helping to reduce \n\none part of the problem, the stem cell source. The amount of stem cells needed in the beginning \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nsignificantly depends on the method that is being followed, since the differentiation into NPCs \n\ncan be done in vitro or in situ, for reasons explained below. \n\nThe in vitro differentiation method has the advantage of assuring that the implanted cells \n\nhave the correct phenotype, although with the disadvantage of more stem cells being needed. \n\nStem cell expansion is not trivial, and many cells are lost while differentiating into NPCs\n133\n\n. The \n\nkey factor, specific for IVD regeneration treatment, is hypoxia (2% O2), since this is the \n\nenvironment where NPCs live in, they can be up to 2-3mm from the closest blood vessel\n52,53\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the best way to ensure that stem cells differentiate into NPCs is by introducing them \n\nin a hypoxic environment, though a lot of cells tend to die due to the lack of oxygen therefore \n\nmore stem cells are needed at start. Zhong Fang and his co-workers\n133\n\n have been working on the \n\nhypothesis of manipulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in order to make them resistant to \n\nhypoxia by adding an anti-apoptotic gene called Bcl-2. By avoiding stem cells to suffer \n\napoptosis on the early stage of differentiation they made these pre-NP phenotype cells to be \n\nresistant to the low concentration of oxygen and thus maintaining cell number even after the \n\nlater stage of differentiation. This way, the initial number of stem cells needed decreased \n\nsignificantly (2.2 times less). But the doubt still remains \u2013 Does this not increase the chance of \n\ncancer cells formation? Decreasing the ability of cells to resort to apoptosis is a step forward for \n\ncells to be unable to commit apoptosis, and losing the ability to die makes them virtually cancer \n\ncells. Nevertheless, this work brings great promise and if proven safe there is no reason why not \n\nto use this method, even in other strategies for IVD regeneration (i.e., cell constructs). \n\nIn situ differentiation method has the advantage of using a standard approach for stem \n\ncell expansion, the process from isolated stem cells until before the injection in the NP is done \n\nthe same way has it was for any other kind of tissue. Steven Leckie and his co-workers\n134\n\n \n\ndeveloped a work following this type of cell-based method. Its purpose was to determine \n\nwhether injecting human umbilical tissue-derived cells into the NP would improve the course of \n\nIDD. The authors injected cells alone (carried by a buffer), carrier alone and carrier + cells. \n\nFollow up was based on MRI, biomechanics and histology findings. The results were not close \n\nenough to the positive control (non-punctured IVDs), and failed to fully restore MRI parameters \n\nfor non-degenerated IVDs. However, they were successful in slowing down the degeneration \n\nprocess and showed better results than the negative control (punctured IVDs). At 12 weeks the \n\nMRI results showed that cells alone and cells + carrier were significantly distinct from \n\npunctured values. Although, regarding the viscoelastic properties, the cell-free carrier and cells \n\n+ carrier were significantly closer to positive control than the cells alone, though not close \n\nenough. If the biological and biochemical conditions within this tissue are not right the use of \n\nthis method can stimulate the growth of blood vessels and nerve endings inside the NP, though. \n\nIn the literature, there has been shown evidences, or at least suspicions, that the appearance of \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nblood vessels and nerve endings inside the NP might be originated by native stem cells\n135\n\n. \n\nTherefore the addition of stem cells could promote this as well as deteriorate the state of the \n\ntissue by further degenerating it, but there is still a need to further research and clarify that.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.1.3. Combined therapy: Cell-laden scaffolds \n\nGwen Crevensten\n8\n used HA as a cell carrier for MSCs. Disc height was evaluated on \n\nseveral time-points, but with no significant results. They evaluated the cells\u2019 viability of the \n\ninjected cellular population by using a cell tracker staining and observed that when using cells + \n\ncarrier, the cells remained viable for up to 28 days by 100%, but no NP phenotype or \n\nbiomechanical behaviour of the hydrogel, after a period of culture, was tested. \n\nAnna Reza and Steven Nicoll\n15\n\n made a very interesting and complete study using \n\nmethacrylated CMC as a carrier for NPCs. Besides analysing the matrix elaboration and \n\nfunctional properties NPC-laden CMC hydrogels, they also compared two different types of \n\nmedium - the standard serum-containing medium formulation versus a serum-free chemically \n\ndefined medium, both of them supplemented with TGF-?3. The results show why using a \n\nchemically defined medium is so important, obviously compensated by its high cost. GAG and \n\ncollagen type II content was significantly greater in serum-free constructs, as well as the \n\nYoung\u2019s modulus, and the equilibrium weight-swelling ratio of the same constructs approached \n\nthat of the native NP tissue (22.19 vs. 19.94, respectively). These results indicate the importance \n\nof medium formulation in NP construct development demonstrated by enhanced functional \n\nmatrix development by NPCs when cultured in CMC hydrogels maintained in serum-free, TGF-\n\n?3 supplement medium. \n\nYung-Hsin Cheng and co-workers\n136\n\n added gelatin to a thermosensitive chitosan and ?-\n\nglycerol-based hydrogel to improve its mechanical strength and gelation properties. Gelatin was \n\nchosen by its low-cost, biocompatibility, biodegradability, but especially due to its gelation \n\nproperties. After evaluating its feasibility to carry cells for NP regeneration, it was observed \n\nfrom the rheological measurements that the gelation temperature was near 33\u00baC, thus liquid at \n\nroom temperature, and that at 37\u00baC its gelation time was 49 seconds. Later on, \n137\n\n the same \n\nscaffold was used in combination with ferulic acid, due to its properties, namely: anti-\n\ninflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-apoptotic, anti-aging, hepatoprotective, \n\nneuroprotective, radioprotective and pulmonary protective. The aim was to perceive if this \n\nbioactive agent had similar protective and/or therapeutic effects on a degenerated IVD. The \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nresults demonstrated that this hydrogel composite has the potential to be used as sustained-\n\nrelease system for hydrophobic compounds (such as ferulic acid). A down-regulation of \n\ncollagen type II synthesis and substantial up-regulation collagen type I. It was observed that \n\nferulic acid can be an interesting molecule to encapsulate in AF scaffolds, such as \n\npolycaprolactone (PCL) being this polymer hydrophobic.  \n\nAnthony Baer\n118\n\n and his colleagues studied the collagen expression and mechanical \n\nproperties of NPC-laden alginate hydrogels. Interestingly the results showed a good cellular \n\nviability, but the mechanical behaviour of the cell-laden hydrogels after 21 days was not near \n\nthe native NP mechanical behaviour. Putting the two different types of results together, it \n\nsuggests that although IVD cells maintain their phenotype characteristics when cultured in \n\nalginate, the synthesised molecules were not able to form a mechanically functional matrix in \n\nvitro. \n\nGG hydrogels (Figure 4.5) have been proposing great results as a material for cartilage \n\nregeneration\n138\n\n, showing interesting features, such as its natural property of being non-\n\nangiogenic\n139\n\n. This is a crucial feature in cell-based approach upon IVD regeneration, since by \n\nkeeping blood vessels away the environment inside the NP can remain hypoxic as it is in \n\nundegenerated IVDs, therefore stimulating NP phenotype even with no GF supplement. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5. Micrograph of methacrylated gellan gum disc with a 1x10\n6 \n\nrabbit NPCs encapsulated, after \n\novernight culturing. Scale bar: 200 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nSilva-Correia and colleagues have been shown indicatives of GG potential for its use in \n\ncartilage regeneration\n140\n\n. A protocol for producing methacrylated-GG (GG-MA) was \n\ndeveloped\n141\n\n. By adjusting the methacrylation reaction to 24 hours, GG-MA mechanical \n\nproperties became the most suitable for NPC-based therapy. Moreover, a photo-polymerizable \n\nclass of GG-MA was also developed allowing its gelification after exposure to ultra-violet (UV) \n\nlight (approximately during 6 minutes). The viability tests showed that UV exposure did not \n\nsignificantly affected the cell number, as the cultures of photo-crosslinked GG-MA with \n\nencapsulated NPCs remained viable up to 21 days\n142,143\n\n. In 2012, the same team ran an \n\nexperiment for evaluating the angiogenic potential of GG, which has shown splendid results for \n\nIVD regeneration treatment applications\n59\n\n. The same team demonstrated the methacrylated \n\nbiocompatibility with both lung fibroblasts cell line (L929) cell line and human IVD cells\n144\n\n. \n\nTherefore, it shows the potential of GG-MA material to be used as an NP substitute. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Annulus Fibrosus \n\nIDD has a starting point in the NP tissue, as already mentioned, but its progression is \n\ntowards the adjacent tissues \u2013 AF (Figure 4.6) and CEPs. The CEPs are a critical tissue for the \n\nwhole IVD\u2019s health maintenance, they are the main source of water and nutrition, and with IDD \n\nprogression they tend to become calcified, therefore loosing supply permeability\n145\n\n. When this \n\npath is blocked, angiogenesis is stimulated inside the IVD that raises oxygen levels, making the \n\nNP normoxic, decreasing the NPCs capacity of PG production by slowly making them \n\nsenescent\n48\n\n. This process only happens in very severe cases of IDD, though being very \n\nimportant for the whole IVD biological balance. When looking into the general picture, the \n\nCEPs are the third last important tissue to focus on regenerating. But maybe it is time for \n\nresearch surrounding IVD TE to start focusing more on the CEP regeneration in order to \n\nprovide the clinics a whole spectrum of available TE therapies for IVD regeneration, from mild \n\nto severe IDD. Although this subject is not addressed here, the authors strongly believe that \n\nthere is a gap in the IVD TE research that urgently needs attention. \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6. \u00b5CT top view of the AF, surrounding a dark area, which is the NP. (\u00b5CT of rabbit AF and \n\nNP. Acquisition parameters: pixel size \u2013 13.18\u00b5m, source 89kV / 112\u00b5A). \n\n \n\nWhen NP loses force-converting abilities, i.e., the ability to convert uniaxial compression \n\ninto hydrostatic pressure, the AF tissue seizes to be pushed aside. When this is combined with \n\nloss of NP volume due to decrease in water content or through herniated annular tears, the \n\ncompression made by the spine structure on the IVD compresses the AF, instead of compressing \n\nthe NP and then pushing the AF from within. When the biomechanics of the IVD are following \n\nthis path of mechanical energy distribution the AF disrupts creating the internal disc disruption \n\npathology, thus contributing to the progression of the degeneration\n47\n\n. When the AF is under this \n\nstate of degeneration it is somehow hopeless to try regenerating the IVD by focusing only on the \n\nNP, since any hydrogel, with seeded cells or not, injected in the IVD, will certainly herniate \n\nthrough the AF after a stronger spine loading\n107\n\n. Therefore, in severe states of IDD it is as \n\nimportant to regenerate the AF as the NP, since any effort on regenerating the NP alone would \n\nbe meaningless unless there is a functional AF to hold the NP tissue in place\n146\u2013148\n\n. In order to \n\ndo that a biphasic (NP + AF) or even a triphasic (NP + inner AF + outer AF) cell construct is \n\nneeded to have the chance to succeed with the treatment. Moreover, future strategies could also \n\naddress the substitution of the CEPs as well, for extreme cases of IDD. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.2.1. Matrices: Biomaterials/Scaffolds \n\nThe AF varies greatly in morphology along its radius, and that is the reason why \n\nresearchers claim that there are two distinct structures within the AF - the inner and the outer \n\nAF\n17,27\n\n. Actually, the biocomposite AF and NP is one whole structure with no evident borders. \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nThe biochemistry of it simply changes gradually from the NP centre to the most peripheral layer \n\nof the outer AF. Since it is not easy to mimic the assembling complexity of the IVD\u2019s ECM \n\nmolecules in order to form the macro structure, the most promising way to produce a whole \n\nIVD cell construct is by defining the borders between the different types of tissue that are to be \n\nmimicked. \n\nThere is one type of ECM component that prevail in each one of the three structures\n32\n\n. \n\nInside the NP there is a major presence of PGs. In opposition to the NP\u2019s biochemical and \n\nmorphological composition is the outer AF. This anisotropic tissue\n149\n\n is mostly made of \n\ncollagen type I, therefore it is an extremely elastic type of tissue. It has a totally different type of \n\nmechanical behaviour from the NP, which is more of an isotropic viscous liquid. The inner AF, \n\nalthough having more collagen type II than the other two types of tissue, is like a mixture of \n\nboth in terms of mechanics and biology, but having a morphological organisation closer to the \n\nouter AF, though\n38\n\n.  \n\nIn this sub-chapter it will be described the types of materials that are being used in \n\nresearch for the AF tissue regeneration strategy. Several materials have been developed and \n\nused as prime-material for preparing AF scaffolds (Figure 4.7). There are an immense amount \n\nof different composites and formulations, though they are based on the same materials, such as: \n\npolylactic acid (PLA)\n150,151\n\n, polyglycolic acid (PGA)\n151,152\n\n, silk\n153,154\n\n, collagen\n155\u2013158\n\n or \n\ndemineralised and decellularised bone matrix (collagen base)\n159\n\n, PCL\n160,161\n\n, alginate, chitosan\n162\n\n \n\nand HA\n150\n\n.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7. Photograph of a three-dimensional printed rabbit IVD replica. Scale bar: 5 mm. \n\n \n\nLike any material to be used in a TE application, it must be biodegradable and \n\nbioresorbable as well as biocompatible while being shape-tailored. However the IVD is an \n\nanatomical structure highly subjected to complex movements and strains\n163\n\n. Therefore, the \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nmaterial chosen to replace the AF, in the short-term, must have similar mechanical properties. It \n\nshould have a similar Young\u2019s modulus that enables the material to sustain high forces while \n\nremaining in the elastic domain, i.e., free of plastic deformation. In the long-term, it must \n\ndegrade at the same timing as the implanted cells are synthesizing the tissue. This ECM \n\nremodelling is manipulated by the cells and depends on the biochemical balance existing inside \n\nthe cell construct, though it is maybe also affected by a piezoelectric effect (i.e., emits electrical \n\nsignals when mechanically requested and vice-versa) created by the collagen, since this \n\nmolecule possesses piezoelectric properties\n164\n\n. The lines of tension change dynamically with \n\nloading cycles of the spine, resulting in degradation of the AF scaffold and synthesis of new \n\nECM. This affects piezoelectricity inside the structure; cells are attracted to where pressure is \n\nfelt, since the collagen upon mechanical stimulation releases electric stimulus that attracts cells \n\nand stimulates them to produce ECM, in order for the whole tissue to be mechanically balanced. \n\nThis effect is similar to what happens in almost every tissue of the human body, a very good \n\nexample is bone since trabeculae and its mineralization are coincident with tension lines felt in \n\nthe tissue\n165\n\n. Briefly, the way that the scaffold degrades, and how its mechanical properties vary \n\nwith it, is very important for the cell construct to be successful upon implantation. \n\nNesti and co-workers\n150\n\n decided to use only one composite material to mimic the whole \n\nIVD structure. They say that if the IVD fails as a unit then it must be regenerated as a material \n\ncomposite unit. They prepared what they have called a HA nanofibrous scaffold that is made \n\nfirst by electrospinning of nanofibrous poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA). The electrospun mat was \n\nthen cut into 1cm\n2\n sections and, after seeding the nanofibrous dense scaffold with MSCs and left \n\novernight, a solution of HA with encapsulated cells was injected inside the PLLA cell construct. \n\nThis, they say, created a pressurized pouch, cuboidal in shape, with the inner core of HA and \n\nnanofibrous elements surrounded by a sheath of dense nanofibrous scaffold. \n\nMunirah Sha\u2019ban and his team\n151\n\n also used polylactic acid as based material, but \n\ncombined with polyglycolic acid, making a composite of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). \n\nThey also used fibrin to allow better cell adhesion to the scaffold after seeding, this way \n\nreducing cell loss in this step. \n\nHowever the AF ECM is mainly made of collagen, being the principal reason why several \n\nresearch groups have been using it for AF scaffold preparation\n155,157,158\n\n. Scaffolds made of \n\ncollagen type I or II have already shown to stimulate IVD cells to produce big PGs and long \n\nGAG chains\n157,166\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n4.3.2.2. Cells \n\nThe literature is consistent on this subject. Most of the research carried out for AF \n\nregeneration has used AFCs\n167\u2013169\n\n, aside from few exceptions that used MSCs\n150\n\n. \n\nThe cell type native to the AF is considered fibroblast-like\n170\n\n. Fibroblast cells constitute \n\nthe easiest type of primary cells to grow in vitro. In fact, usually they are unwanted, since \n\nsometimes they contaminate the isolated cell culture due to its higher rate of proliferation, \n\nrepresenting the worst and most common type of autologous contamination in cell isolation \n\nprocedures\n171\n\n. Therefore, there are several approaches regarding cell types seeded in AF TE \n\nscaffolds, which are still not proven worthless to research as integrated part of therapeutic \n\nstrategies that aim full IVD regeneration, even for severe cases of IDD. \n\nThe most common approach seen in the literature is seeding the AF scaffold with \n\nAFCs\n167\u2013169\n\n. These cells are easy to isolate and have the desired phenotype, since they are native \n\nto the tissue. If the study is being made in vitro, i.e., without an in vivo surrounding source of \n\nnative fibroblast, then the AFCs might be the most advisable option. Since acellular AF scaffold \n\nassessment would only be realistic as a model for short-term implantation, long-term results \n\nwould require in vivo studies to observe fibroblast migration. The \u201ckeep-it-simple\u201d approach is \n\nthe acellular AF scaffold. The idea is that fibroblast cells are easy to taxis (e.g., chemotaxis), \n\nand have proliferative advantage in comparison to other cell types. In this sense, the acellular \n\napproach can provide good results, since native fibroblast will migrate to the AF scaffold and \n\nproliferate, being the scaffold seeded or not. \n\nThere is a short percentage of research in AF regeneration that uses MSCs as a seeding \n\npopulation. The main reason is to use only one cell type in the whole IVD cell construct (since \n\nmost AF regeneration research implies the regeneration of the NP as well, due to IDD line of \n\nprogression), and at the same time have, as a final result, both cell types - AFCs and NPCs. \n\nTherefore, this strategy combines the advantages from both two remaining alternatives - in a \n\nway, it is a \u201ckeep-it-simple\u201d approach but also complete. But it is not a perfect approach, since it \n\nwould require using at least two different GFs, which would significantly increase the estimated \n\ncost of the future optimised approach in the clinics. Also, it compensates one type of cell \u201ckeep-\n\nit-simple\u201d approach (e.g., NPCs in hydrogel with acellular AF scaffold), since it involves two \n\npaths of differentiation would complicate the already difficult task of assessing just one path of \n\ndifferentiation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n4.3.2.3. Combined therapy: Cell-laden scaffolds \n\nThe great advantage of developing acellular strategies is its simplicity, rapid application \n\nand predictability. Though, as soon as the material is implanted the degradation time starts, thus \n\nit is important for cell construct\u2019s maturation, i.e., ECM production to native tissue levels, to be \n\nas fast as possible. And the maturation of cell constructs in vivo is faster if cells are already \n\nseeded in the scaffold. Making taxis of migrating fibroblasts, from outside the cell construct, \n\nsynergic, instead of fundamental for maturation. Therefore, several strategies for AF \n\nregeneration, that have been developed, use seeded cells. \n\nWan and co-workers\n172\n\n develop a biphasic scaffold just as an AF scaffold, i.e., without \n\nfocusing on NP regeneration, this way mimicking the properties of the inner and outer AF \n\ntissues. A demineralised and decellularised bone matrix gelatin (BMG) from the extracted \n\ncortical bone using as a source New Zealand white rabbit femur was prepared as the outer phase \n\nof the scaffold. After the process of demineralisation and decellularisation what remains \n\nessentially, regarding molecule composition, is a natural material with high collagen type I \n\ncontent, like the outer AF. To mimic the inner AF tissue, they produced a scaffold orientated in \n\nconcentric sheets of poly(PCL triol malate) (PPCLM) seeded with chondrocytes in order to \n\nmimic the lamella structured cartilage-like inner AF. This strategy is interesting regarding its \n\nbiomechanics, since PPCLM spiral open when NP pushes the cell-scaffold construct, but on the \n\nother hand the BMG ring does not let it unfold. Therefore, it was created a string-like effect that \n\nmimics the AF native tissue in a different biomechanical strategy. Although, the scaffolds do \n\nnot mimic the lamellar structure of the native AF tissue despite contrary information, therefore \n\nthe mechanical performance of the cell constructs reached not even half of the AF rabbit tissue, \n\nnot being enough to withstand a tensile stress of 4 MPa. In this study, it was shown that by \n\ncontrolling the PPCLM polymerization time it is possible to prepare AF scaffolds with different \n\ndegrading behaviours that can be tuned according with the ECM synthesis along the \n\nregeneration process. By using a PCL-based material, it was avoided the problem of increasing \n\nacidification inside the cell constructs, upon scaffold degradation, since the PCL byproducts do \n\nnot acidify the environment\n172\n\n. \n\nPark and his team\n173\n\n did a study with outstanding results in terms of final silk scaffold \n\nmorphology, resembling very closely with the AF tissue. After solubilizing the silk, a mixture of \n\nsodium alginate solution was added and injected it into cylindrical shaped (12 mm in diameter \n\nand 5 mm thick) silicon moulds. The moulds were subjected to a standard lyophilisation for 2 \n\ndays and then water-annealed to generate the insoluble state of silk by inducing ?-sheet \n\ncrystallinity. The mixed alginate was removed from the scaffold by immersion in water for 24 \n\nhours and the donut-shaped silk scaffolds were achieved by simple punching. The results \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\nshowed highly dense lamellar structure with spaces between lamellas varying from 10 to 400 \n\n\u00b5m. The silk is a material very used in TE research, there is no need to point here its good \n\nbiocompatibility and adhesion properties, what is in fact interesting is that this scaffold in this \n\nmacro form and micro-lamellar structure has an elongation to failure very close to the human \n\nAF tissue at the first week, slightly less after 2 weeks, though. Unfortunately, regarding the \n\nYoung\u2019s modulus, that in our point of view is the mechanical property that really matters, is \n\nquite far from the human AF. Their lamellar silk scaffold had a compressive Young\u2019s modulus \n\nof 0.3-0.4 MPa after 2 weeks of culture, while the human AF is around 1.23 MPa. However the \n\nwork is far from effortless, since the morphological structure of the silk toroidal is a perfect \n\nscaffold, in the literal sense of the word, to guide collagen deposition. Probably, with times of \n\nculture longer than 2 weeks, the cell constructs can gain optimal mechanical properties, since \n\nsilk is strong but not elastic, therefore, with further deposition of collagen the cell construct can \n\nbecome extremely elastic while still strong. \n\nIVD TE research is already extensive and several obstacles are being surpassed, though \n\nthere is an argument still not mentioned, the structural compatibility, not in terms of \n\nmorphology but in terms of optimal fitting within the intervertebral space. Generally, NP \n\nscaffolds are gel-like so they do not enter on this subject, but AF is an elastic solid that is often \n\nmimicked by a circular shaped scaffold, not even the disc-like geometry\n155\n\n. Even if the disc-like \n\nshape is mimicked, the top and down surfaces are not prepared according to the CEPs surface, \n\ntherefore what is being developed are TE-TDR implants with a high potential to suffer \n\ndisplacement upon spine loading when in vivo. A more structural patient-specific type of \n\napproach must be addressed, and that is precisely the subject discussed in the next chapter. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n5. Future Advanced Strategies for Patient-specific Tissue Engineering: Reverse \n\nEngineering and Rapid Prototyping \n\n \n\nTERM comprise different treatment strategies in which it can be applied a patient-\n\nspecific type of approach. The idea is to use the know-how of patient\u2019s own cells in order to \n\nregenerate a specific tissue. This way, it stimulates the natural way of biological tissue building, \n\nin a bottom-up approach, in alternative to top-down strategy, used by repair strategies. Also, by \n\nusing the patient\u2019s own cells, there is a huge decrease in the risk of implant rejection, thus being \n\na patient-specific treatment. \n\nThe point where TERM diverges is on the use of a scaffold as a cell support, RM focus \n\non using only cells while TE uses a scaffold combined with cells, as mentioned. In a way, RM \n\ntreatments in general are patient-specific as far as they can get, but TE can still be more patient-\n\nspecific that it already is, since scaffolds can be structurally produced according with the \n\npatient\u2019s needs. For example, if a bone tumour is surgically removed from a patient, and the gap \n\nthat remains has a cubic geometry of 4 mm in length, then the patient needs exactly a 4 mm \n\nscaffold cube. That scaffold geometry is the most appropriate for that patient\u2019s defect, but for \n\nthe next patient probably will not be. Thus, if a patient needs a TE treatment, he will need not \n\nonly an immunocompatible cell source (patient\u2019s own cells) but also a structurally compatible \n\nscaffold. The authors believe that this is the challenge that TE is facing, the field needs to \n\nprogress in this direction in order to produce treatments with even more patient-specificity, re-\n\nenforcing this that is the biggest advantage in the TE strategy. \n\nIn this sense, RE and rapid prototyping RP technologies can be fused together with TE in \n\norder to prepare the next generation type of cell constructs in order to fulfil the patient-specific \n\nstructural needs. RE concerns the data acquisition and three-dimensional (3D) model \n\npreparation, which is followed by RP for processing the material into the desired physical form. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1. Reverse Engineering  \n\n \n\nRE definition first came as the process of extracting the knowledge or blueprint from \n\nanything man-made. Now with its increasing potential of use into the TE field, its definition can \n\nbe extended to the process of extracting the knowledge or blueprint of any given object\u2019s \n\nstructure, whether man-made or not, e.g., biological. This type of engineering concerns the data \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nuptake of the patient\u2019s anatomical structure, more specifically the part that is in need of \n\nregeneration, this process is called two-dimensional (2D) image acquisition. Which applied to \n\nbiological tissues can be made by any imaging equipment system, but it has shown to work well \n\nwith MRI\n174\n\n or CT\n175,176\n\n. MRI seems more appropriate for soft tissues and the CT for hard \n\ntissues. Although, when applying RE to biological tissues a micro analyser version of these \n\ndevices is advised in order to acquire the smallest details, which usually are crucial for the \n\nmechanical or physiological functioning of the whole tissue. \n\nFor conversion and processing of the acquired 2D images several types of software are \n\nneeded. The acquired raw images, obtained from micro-CT (\u00b5CT), are vertical images that are a \n\nresult of sequential turning either of the analysing object within the imaging device or of both \n\nemitter and receiver around the object. These images must be then converted into stack images. \n\nRaw 2D image processing is followed by segmentation, which returns the raw 3D model \n\nof the native anatomical structure. In this step the user must select the part of interest within the \n\n2D images. This can be done by creating a mask, and by painting with it slice-by-slice (each 2D \n\nstack image at a time) the pixels that belong to the desired anatomical structure. The mask will \n\nafterwards be the 3D model, the 2D images are kind of a guide/map for the user to paint what it \n\nis thought relevant. It is normal in acquisition to obtain over 300 images from one sample, so \n\nthis step can be really time consuming. But there are ways to make it faster, in some software \n\nthere are tools such as \u201cpainting with threshold\u201d that enables masking the pixels within a \n\nspecific grey-scale range. Briefly, the 2D images returned from the \u00b5CT are in a grey-scale, in \n\nwhich each pixel has a type of grey that corresponds to a number that is associated to a specific \n\noriginal density (average density of the tissue\u2019s area, which corresponds to that pixel). \n\nTherefore, if the objective is to select only the bone and not the soft tissues there is the \n\npossibility of painting with a threshold that fits in a range of whiter colours of grey-scale. When \n\nsegmentation is finished a 3D model can be exported, though it usually has a great amount of \n\ninformation, way more than it is needed (i.e., details that cannot be applied in the following \n\nsteps due to technological limitations regarding RP detail resolution).  \n\nTherefore, after the 3D model (e.g., STL format) is done, it needs to be processed in order \n\nto reduce its computational size for easier conversion into a 3D printable file format (it depends \n\non the computer system capabilities). There are some software tools that can be used, such as: \n\nfix, cut, wrap and fillet, but a good tool to work with is the smoothing, which reduces the \n\nsurface roughness/detail. However, this is an indispensable step, even for the best computational \n\nsystems, since the 3D model must mature into a closed surface with every finite element \n\norganised in the proper way, i.e., with a positive normal vector and no finite element \n\noverlapping\n176\n\n. \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2. Finite Element Method  \n\n \n\nThe finite element method (FEM) is a relatively recent methodology, it was developed in \n\nthe middle of the last century and started to gain interest with the evolution of computational \n\nhardware. This method requires a great deal of mathematical calculus, therefore it was only \n\nwhen computers gain the capabilities to handle more complex formulas that it started to be \n\nstandardly used in the engineering industry. In the last two decades, it revolutionised the world \n\nof engineering, and replaced several other methods that did not require a computer, e.g., finite \n\ndifference method, to use almost exclusively FEM. Before that, engineers made continuum \n\nmedium analysis of a specific problem by associating it to an already known and extensively \n\nstudied type of problem, in order to use tables to address the values of unknown parameters. \n\nThis association is very useful, but it also carries the disadvantage of adding a great deal of \n\nuncertainty to the results, i.e., high error factor between real and nominal values. As a \n\nconsequence of that, more (or stronger) material would have to be used in order for the given \n\nstructure to be safe, resulting in higher costs than needed, among other things. \n\nEvery given geometry can be described by a mathematical model. This formula is \n\ngenerally a complex integral impossible to calculate (or it takes an unreasonable amount of \n\ntime). FEM uses the problem solving logic called \u2018divide and conquer\u2019, which divides a big and \n\ncomplex problem into several small and simple problems easy to solve. FEM formulation \n\nprovides the possibility of replacing the integral ruled under the complex domain of the \n\nstructure (volume V) by summation of integrals ruled under sub domains of simple geometries \n\n(volume Vi). This technique is illustrated with the following example, which corresponds to the \n\nvolume integral of the function f: \n\n \n\n? ? ?? =  ? ? ? ??\n??\n\n?\n\n?=1?\n\n                     (2) \n\nIn (2) it is assumed that: \n\n? = ? ??\n\n?\n\n?=1\n\n \n\n \n\n(3) \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nEach sub domain Vi matches a single finite element of simple geometry, such as a \n\ntriangle, rectangle, line segment, cuboid, among others\n177\n\n. \n\nFEM is used to create a mesh after segmentation, it literally divides the surface into an \n\nassembly of triangles or rectangles (depending on the structure) with different orientations and \n\nsizes making up for the whole 3D model. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3. Rapid Prototyping  \n\n \n\nRP was first developed to produce realistic models of given structures, not specifically \n\nuse them as parts of a mechanism but as models for those parts, in order to help easier spatial \n\nvisualization. Furthermore, the field evolved into the production of objects with more complex \n\ngeometries, and made of materials with capabilities of withstanding higher forces or even \n\ndynamic handling. Therefore, RP equipment started to be used for industrial production\n178\n\n. \n\nThere are several types of RP technologies divided into two ways of achieving the final \n\nobject, subtractive or additive manufacturing. While the first removes material until the final \n\nobject is done, the second is responsible for adding layer over layer until the production is \n\nfinished. The three most used technologies in 3D printing (Figure 5.2) to be used in the TE field \n\nare: (i) selective laser sintering (SLS), (ii) stereolithography (SLA), and (iii) fused deposition \n\nmodelling (FDM). Other technologies for rapid prototyping are laminated object manufacturing, \n\nsolid base curing, optical fabrication, photochemical machining, among others, though they will \n\nnot be described here due to its low interest to be used in the AF scaffold development. \n\n \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1. Fused Deposition Modelling, 3D printer from Makerbot\u2122. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3.1. Stereolithography \n\nSLA (Figure 5.3.1) is the additive polymerization, layer-by-layer, of a material on a \n\nmoving platform by UV exposure in selective spatial points. This method requires the use of a \n\nphoto-polymerizable material, which at start is in the liquid state, generally called resin. This \n\nresin is placed inside a container, which is then selectively polymerized, following the \n\ncomputer-aided design (CAD) of the desired final object, i.e., the light beam focuses on voxels \n\nrepresented in the CAD model\n179\n\n. \n\nDue to the limitation for only being able to use photo-polymerizable materials, this \n\nmethod has the tendency to be more expensive. But, on the other hand, the outcomes of it are \n\nextremely accurate and precise, with tolerances below 0.05 mm\n180,181\n\n. \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2. Stereolithography process explained in the form of a scheme. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3.2. Fused Deposition Modelling \n\nFDM (Figure 5.3.2) uses an extruder nozzle composed by heating chamber used to fuse a \n\nmaterial, generally a polymer or a metal. The melted material is extruded through the nozzle in \n\nareas specified by the CAD model, layer-by-layer, until the object is complete\n182\n\n. The STL file \n\ninput is generally converted into a G-code file, which converts the CAD model into a group of \n\nvirtual filaments that altogether make up for the 3D model. These lines are the path taken by the \n\nextruder while extruding the fused material, which after a few seconds of being at room \n\ntemperature it starts to solidify. \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3. Fused Deposition Modelling process: (1) heat extruder of melted material; (2) aggregated \n\ndeposited polymer filaments; (3) printing bed. \n\n \n\nThe most tempting advantage of this method is the extremely low-cost of the equipment \n\nsystem. Recently 3D printing based on FDM became very popular among hobbyists due to its \n\nlow cost 3D printers (1,000-3,000\u20ac), and its popularity is growing with time.  \n\nComparing with SLA this method is more appropriate to construct bigger objects due to \n\nits cheap available filament polymers: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, PLA and PVA. Although \n\nseveral other materials can be used as long as the extruder\u2019s heating head is able to fuse it\n183,184\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Selective Laser Sintering \n\nThe idea behind SLS (Figure 5.3.3) is not far from SLA, though they handle materials in \n\ndifferent phase state. While SLA uses at start a liquid material, the second handles the material \n\nin the form of powder. This technology applies a laser in a selective way to join the granules of \n\nthe powder together, i.e., sintering, in order to create the 3D structure\n185\n\n. \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4. Schematic representation of Selective Laser Sintering process. \n\n \n\nBriefly, the CAD model is first divided into a finite number of thin slices, and the data is \n\nthen uploaded to the manufacturing equipment. The equipment first adds a layer of the powder \n\nmaterial that is then exposed to a laser beam that only focuses on the respective areas of the \n\nCAD\u2019s first slice, resulting on the sintering of this layer whereas the rest of the material remains \n\nin the powder form. After, the platform moves down, and the next layer of powder material is \n\napplied, the process repeats itself by following the next slices of the CAD model until the object \n\nis finished\n186,187\n\n. \n\nIn general, all structures manufactured using any of these technologies, or others, can be \n\nused for a functional purpose. It depends on the technology being applied, but it mainly depends \n\non the material that is used. Furthermore, it is possible to analyse if a material will serve the \n\nfinal purpose, since it is possible to simulate the CAD model under several physical situations \n\nby introducing in the software the known values of the mechanical behaviour parameters related \n\nto the material that is after used. The result will give an estimate on if the structure made with a \n\ncertain material will have the minimal requirements for a given function or not\n188\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\n5.4. Reverse Engineering and Rapid Prototyping Technologies Applied to \n\nTissue Engineering  \n\n \n\nThe first thing that must be kept in mind, when using RE and RP in TE (Figure 5.5), is \n\nthat the accuracy and resolution of the prototype in comparison with the original native tissue is \n\nlimited by the less precise equipment used in the whole process \u2013 from acquisition to 3D \n\nprinting. In general, the computational modelling does not interfere with the outcome resolution \n\nof the final scaffold, all it is needed is a good computer to be able to handle the amount of \n\nprocesses needed for the modelling. In the end, this limitation is placed between properties of \n\nthe \u00b5CT and the 3D printer. Comparing the state of the art between both technologies gives a \n\nbetter outcome for the imaging side, which provides the conclusion that the 3D printer normally \n\nlimits the resolution of the final prototype. A \u00b5CT can have a resolution down to 7\u00b5m (1072 \n\n\u00b5CT; Skyscan, Belgium) isotropic detail detection, while an SLA 3D printer has a resolution in \n\nthe order of 25 \u00b5m (The Form 1 3D Printer; Formlabs, USA). All of this must be analysed \n\nbefore working with 3D modelling since there is no need for extensive computational \n\nprocessing in details smaller than the limited resolution of the whole RE and RP process (i.e., \n\n<25 \u00b5m), which can be extremely time consuming. \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5. Schematic representation of Reverse Engineering and Rapid Prototyping allied to an \n\nintervertebral disc Tissue Engineering strategy (which was followed in this work). \n\n \n\nSeveral strategies can be taken when using RE and RP together with TE, but can be \n\nresumed down to two strategies: solid-based scaffold preparation or solid-free-based scaffold\n189\n\n. \n\nIn order to choose between strategies, one thing must be decided before \u2013 will the cell construct \n\nmature before or after implantation, i.e., will it mature in vitro or in situ? This is especially \n\nimportant if the tissue to be replaced is subjected to mechanical stimulus or not, in other words, \n\nif the tissue has or not a biomechanical function? In a way, if a solid-based cell construct is \n\nmatured in situ then it can be classified as a short-term repair strategy while the cell construct is \n\nmaturing, and with time it has a regenerating effect, i.e., in middle-term and long-term. The \n\nadvantage of this approach is the low amount of time between cell isolation until implantation, \n\nbut with the disadvantage of balancing the mechanical properties of the scaffold (while it \n\ndegrades) versus mechanical properties of the native healthy tissue for mimicking reasons, and \n\nthe degradation time versus regeneration rate (ECM production) to avoid gaps of malfunction \n\nalong the treatment. \n\nSolid-free-based cell construct is a concept developed and used by Gabor Forgacs, \n\nAnthony Atala and their co-workers\n189\u2013193\n\n. The concept has a lifetime of around a decade, but \n\nholds great promise\n189,190\n\n. A two year company, named Organovo\u2122, has been created based on \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nall the work performed by him and his team, which was considered the most innovative \n\ncompany in the world in its first year of life, and in 5 months had an increased share price \n\naround ~600%, though with a similar decrease afterwards but it only means that investors are \n\nwatching its evolution very closely. Its concept was named Bioprinting\n192\n\n, which uses high-\n\nresolution 3D printers that build structures in an additive manner, like other 3D printing \n\ntechnologies. But instead of delivering filaments of fused material or polymerizing specific sites \n\nof the resin material, it deposits spheroid units. Spheroids, following their definition, are units of \n\ncell pellet in a spherical shape, although it can have other shapes (e.g., ellipsoids)\n193\n\n. By adding \n\nspheroids following a CAD model, the spheroids will automatically fuse together, upon cell \n\nconstruct maturation in vitro, allowing a three-dimensional support of its cells and its ECM \n\nproduct. Spheroids can be made of different types of cells, and several different types of \n\nspheroids can be used easily when bioprinting a cell construct. In this manner, the printing \n\npossibilities are massive with no significant degree of difficulty in comparison with its potential. \n\nBriefly, the process of making spheroids starts by releasing the cells from the culture flask and \n\ntypical centrifuging. The pellet is then re-suspended in 4mL of medium and cultured in a small \n\nculture flask for one hour on a gyratory shaker. Then the solution is extracted and centrifuged at \n\nvery high speed, e.g., 3500 rpm. The pellet is transferred to a capillary micropipette that, then, \n\nextrudes a cell pellet filament to be further cut into small equal fragments with a diameter of \n\n300 or 500 \u00b5m. These small pellet pieces are then left on a gyratory shaker to round up, by \n\nbeing cultured in suspension flasks. These spheroids have defined diameter/volume and cell \n\nnumber\n194\n\n. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5. Authors\u2019 Considerations on Tissue Engineering the Intervertebral \n\nDisc Using Bioprinting Technology  \n\n \n\nTake for example the IVD structure as a possible application of this concept. Its \n\nbiological formulation varies radially \u2013 from the centre to the periphery. A range of different \n\ntypes of spheroids could be made with different percentages of two or three types of cells (AFCs \n\n+ NPCs, AFCs + MSCs, MSCs + NPCs or AFCs + MSCs + NPCs). Each type of spheroid \n\nwould be introduced inside one syringe. The system would work with the same concept of \n\nregular FDM printers, with the difference of replacing the heat extruder with a precise micro-\n\nsyringe pump. The ability to change the syringe in the middle of the bioprinting process would \n\nbe provided, at the same time delivering precise amounts of spheroids down to one-by-one. \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nEach voxel, i.e., 3D imaging unit (3D version of a pixel), of the 3D model would belong to one \n\nspheroid, and each layer would be bioprinted one at a time and each radial IVD filament would \n\nbe printed with the same syringe/type of spheroids. This is still a preliminary idea since the cell \n\nconstructs would have several maturation possibilities. However, by encapsulating also \n\nbioactive molecules that stimulate the right phenotype and with external mechanical stimulus in \n\nthe right differentiation line, by using a bioreactor, with progressing pressures, it can be that the \n\nonly maturation possibility would be the correct one, i.e., towards a healthy native IVD. This \n\nway the native morphology of a healthy IVD would slowly appear until full maturation. Then \n\nagain, this will be a rather time consuming process as well as expensive, (even) when optimized, \n\nsince it would require GFs and, probably, serum-free chemically defined medium. \n\nBioprinting technology, despite being still under optimization, for now it seems \n\npromising to be used for regeneration of non-mechanic-subjected tissues. This way cell \n\nconstruct maturation can occur partially already in vivo. However, when the method is applied \n\nto tissues that are subjected to mechanical forces, e.g., cartilage, the cell construct must almost \n\nfully mature in vitro before implantation, in order for it to have the capability to withstand \n\ncompression present in the tissue and be able to function biomechanically (Table 5.1). This is an \n\nobstacle that solid-scaffold based TE strategies do not have, since the scaffold is mechanically \n\nfunctional while the tissue is maturating in vivo, i.e., it employs a short-term repair strategy. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1. Solid-free based TE versus solid-scaffold based TE for regeneration of mechanically subjected \n\ntissues. \n\nStrategy Solid-free based TE Solid-scaffold based TE \n\nMaturation In vitro In vivo \n\nAdvantages \n\nPredictable after implantation - safer; \n\nFast integration with surrounding \n\ntissues. \n\nRapid preparation and application; \n\nSimpler; \n\nCheaper. \n\nDisadvantages \n\nExpensive; \n\nComplex; \n\nSlow preparation. \n\nLess predictable; \n\nCan suffer implant displacement. \n\n \n\nIn addition, the maturation of the cell construct takes a long time if not accelerated, since \n\nthe process requires production and deposition of ECM until its typical amount, on a native \n\nhealthy tissue, is reached. Therefore, for tissues such as the IVD, the authors believe that \n\nbioprinting strategies still need optimization in order to be successfully used in the clinics. \n\nMoreover, solid-based cell construct\u2019s preparation looks more suitable since it enables the \n\nproduction of a cell constructs that can be minimally matured in a bioreactor until implantation, \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nand have the major part of its maturation in vivo. This because the cell construct has a solid part \n\nthat can in the short-term after implantation serve has a repair strategy, by providing mechanical \n\nsupport and function for the whole tissue. At the same time, cells carried inside can produce \n\nECM while the scaffold structure is being degraded. Therefore, a cheaper and easier alternative \n\nto bioprinting is to use SLA or FDM 3D printing in a RE solid-based TE strategy. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n6. Final Remarks and Future Trends \n\n \n\nThe IVD is a complex natural shock absorber system that is arranged in an incredible \n\nfashion, taking advantage of viscous gel liquid with an elastic soft tissue. NP regeneration \n\nsubstitutes, namely hydrogels carrying cells look very promising, and seem ready to be tried in \n\nthe clinics. But IDD settles without warning the patient until it is in a severe state, since LBP is \n\ntriggered only then. Generally that is the case when the patient seeks for medical attention. \n\nAnnular tears are associated with AF tissue degeneration, thus it reveals loss of full capacity to \n\nsupport the NP efficiently (the remaining NP volume after discectomy), as much a hydrogel \n\n(extra volume added to the remaining NP volume). Thus, strategies aiming for regeneration of \n\nboth AF and NP tissues seem to have a better probability of reaching the clinics, but an ideal AF \n\nregeneration substitute is still missing. \n\nA possible strategy, to produce an AF scaffold, is to use technologies that are only now \n\nreaching the TE field, although they have been used in industrial engineering for decades. RE \n\ncombined with RP might have the potential to produce the ideal AF scaffold, though these \n\ntechnologies still need optimization to better analyse and reproduce the micron level, and \n\nfurthermore the nano. Imaging technologies are already able to acquire data at the sub-micron \n\nlevel, it is a question of time until it evolves to an even higher resolution. This would provide \n\nthe AF tissue\u2019s details to prepare an accurate 3D model that could then be employed in a direct \n\nlaser writing RP technology system. This way the lamellar morphology of this tissue could be \n\nmimicked, which would offer a better chance for the AF tissue to regenerate, as well as the NP.  \n\nThe next obstacle will probably be the implant displacement already being seen in the \n\nIVD repair field. The solution to this problem could be a biodegradable stent, surrounding the \n\nTE-TDR implant and both adjacent vertebrae that would remain in position until implant \n\nintegration. \n\nAnother problem will be the lack of data imaging from how the degenerated patient\u2019s \n\nIVD was, when healthy, in order to reverse engineer it. But as long as the top and down CEPs\u2019 \n\nsurface topography is recordable the only parameter lacking is the correct IVD height. And that \n\ncan be calculated by statistically studying the average height of the IVD according with its other \n\ndimensions. \n\nThe future IVD TE strategies will certainly rely on stem cell differentiation. Human \n\nNPCs\u2019 isolation generally is contaminated with other types of cells from the foramen region, \n\nupon discectomy, and NPCs tend to be already senescent due to IDD. The use of these cells is \n\ninteresting in TE research, but when a strategy actually goes to clinics it will need a sustainable \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\ncell source. Therefore, the differentiation pathways towards NPC type still need to be cleared \n\nand optimized. \n\nMoreover, the in vitro culture conditions for TE-TDR implant maturation are needed for \n\nthis type of strategy to be successful. Thus, IVD TE lacks a tunable hypoxia (2% O2) bioreactor \n\nfor both compression and hydrostatic pressure conditions, for culturing TE-TDR implant and \n\nNP cell constructs alone, respectively. \n\nThe emerging and promising next generation of engineered NP will rely on the \n\nproduction of scaffolds with functional cues, aiming at driving proper IVD regeneration. In this \n\nsense, an interesting approach would be the combination of scaffolds with NPCs, or stem cells, \n\nwith GFs to stimulate NPC phenotype, cell migration, differentiation and tissue remodeling, \n\nrespectively. The delivery of relevant biochemical cues by drug delivery systems would allow \n\ntheir sequential release in a manner that mimics the temporal profile of the healing process in \n\nvivo. TGF-?1 has been shown to guide the differentiation of stem cells towards NPCs, whilst \n\nTGF-?3 is an important protein to maintain their phenotype. Moreover, for the regeneration to \n\nbe successful in the long-term, a GF or a drug (e.g., bevacizumab) release system would avoid \n\nangiogenesis on newly formed tissue\n195\n\n. Though GG based hydrogels shown to be non-\n\nangiogenic it degrades while tissue regenerates thus allowing angiogenesis to occur while tissue \n\nregeneration reaches a stable level. Therefore, a particulate system that allows the release of \n\nboth proteins and drugs, in a sustained and independent fashion, would facilitate cell \n\nattachment, proliferation and differentiation of NPCs in a synergistic manner as well as disable \n\nthe possibility for angiogenesis. \n\n  \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nII. Patient-Specific Tissue Engineered Total Disc Replacement \n\n \n\n \n\n1. Hypothesis \n\n \n\nIntervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is the main cause for low back pain (LBP), to \n\nwhich the standard available treatments address the symptoms and not the disease, possibly \n\nfollowed by serious side effects. A small percentage of patients become chronic, but are these \n\ncases that weigh the most in LBP\u2019s worldwide socioeconomic impact estimated at 70 billion \n\neuros per year\n1\n. Therefore, the cost per patient is very high meaning there is a gap in the medical \n\nmarket for more sophisticated treatment strategies. Therefore, effective treatments for IDD \n\nshould minimize the suffering of a great number of patients as well as reduce its socioeconomic \n\nimpact. \n\nBy analysing what was discussed in the General Introduction it can be stated that a \n\nfully regenerated intervertebral disc (IVD), in severe IDD cases, can be successfully achieved \n\nby means of using a tissue engineering (TE) strategy. In fact, TE holds the potential to have in \n\nthe future the advantages of all treatment strategies: short-term repair, long-term regeneration, \n\nand LBP neutralization. Several TE strategies for the NP or total IVD regeneration have been \n\ndescribed elsewhere in the scientific literature\n4,8,15,118,137,172,173\n\n. For nucleus pulposus (NP) \n\nregeneration alone, several hydrogels have been developed for supporting native NP cells \n\n(NPCs) (acellular scaffolds), or for carrying mesenchymal stem cells or NPCs, namely \n\nalginate\n118\n\n, carboxymethylcellulose\n15\n\n, hyaluronan\n8\n, among others\n\n1\n. Gellan gum (GG) hydrogels \n\nhave been suggested as a suitable platform to support NPCs functions as well as to avoid \n\nangiogenesis that helps to maintain hypoxia levels inside the NP, thus stimulating NPC\u2019s \n\nphenotype\n59,105\n\n. The methacrylation of GG allowed tuning of its mechanical properties for \n\nmimicking the NP by controlling the reaction time of the methacrylation\n9,143,15,16\n\n. However, \n\ndespite the considerable progress in engineering the NP of IVD, none has led to translation to \n\nclinical implementation. One of the reasons is lack of effective strategies to regenerate damaged \n\nannulus fibrosus (AF), since the NP regeneration strategies alone cannot effectively prevent re-\n\nherniation in severe cases, and in average patients show signs of AF degeneration. Therefore a \n\nsupport material is needed to help holding the newly restored NP. As a component that plays a \n\ncritical role in the biomechanical properties of the IVD, the structural integrity of AF is essential \n\nto confine the NP and maintain physiological intradiscal pressure upon loading\n147\n\n. The most \n\nused polymers for the production of AF scaffolds are mainly collagen\n155\u2013158\n\n, and aliphatic \n\npolyesters that includes polylactic acid \n151,196\n\n, polyglycolic acid \n151,152\n\n, and its copolymers. The \n\ncurrently available literature describes that the majority of AF scaffolds have been mainly \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nprocessed by electrospinning in the form of nanofibers, which have been showing good \n\nresults\n146\n\n. Polycaprolactone (PCL) in particular, has been proposed for several biomedical \n\napplications, including TE, due to its chemical versatility\n197\n\n, easy processability and tuning \n\npossibility of the mechanical properties to match a desired role\n198\n\n. Though, PCL has a bigger \n\nelastic domain than other candidate materials, i.e., higher resistance to plastic deformation\n147\n\n, \n\ndue to its low melting-point (~60\u00baC).  \n\nIn terms of cellular AF regeneration strategies, they mainly consist in the usage of AF \n\ncells (AFCs), which are characterized as fibroblast-like\n57\n\n. At the same time, TE strategies often \n\nface the problem of fibroblast invasion, for IVD regeneration this becomes a solution, thus \n\nmaking acellular AF constructs seem more appropriate. \n\nDespite the several promising studies to fully regenerate the IVD\n152,158,167,196\n\n, none until \n\nnow as achieved a precise replication of a customized IVD scaffold to prepare a TE-total disc \n\nreplacement (TE-TDR) implant. By observing the state-of-the-art outcomes of IDD repair \n\nstrategies, which are already being applied in the clinics, it is noticeable to presume what can go \n\nwrong in implanting a TE-TDR, i.e., implant displacement\n170\n\n. Therefore, patient specificity is \n\nimportant for achieving better implant integration (whether in a TE or in a repair approach) and \n\nthus reducing the risk of dislocation. That is precisely our main concern with this work. \n\nHerein, it is proposed an innovative customized implant for total disc regeneration, \n\nspecifically for AF substitution, by means of using reverse engineering (RE) and rapid \n\nprototyping (RP) technologies. In this sense, it was established a method using micro-computed \n\ntomography (\u00b5CT) equipment for intervertebral space stack image acquisition to three-\n\ndimensional (3D) model a customized virtual IVD replica (STL. File) for further G-Code \n\nrefinement using a rabbit spine model as proof-of-concept. Injectable GG hydrogels have been \n\nshown to be a suitable platform to support and deliver cells for non-invasive injectable TE \n\napplications\n138\n\n. With this in mind, and aiming at mimicking the NP structure within the TE-\n\nTDR implant, rabbit NPCs have been encapsulated in the GG-MA hydrogels and cultured in \n\nvitro up to 21 days. The viability of both NPCs and lung fibroblasts cell line (L929) was \n\ninvestigated by Live/Dead staining assay and DNA quantification. The NPCs\u2019 proliferation \n\nprofile in the methacrylated gellan gum (GG-MA) was assessed by mitochondrial activity over \n\nthe 21 days of culture and compared with the same assessment for L929 cell line encapsulated \n\nas well in GG-MA. \n\n  \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1. Spine Segments Extraction and Discriminated Intervertebral Disc \n\nCells Isolation  \n\n \n\nIn order to fulfil this work\u2019s objectives, rabbit spine segments were extracted for the \n\npurpose of discriminated isolation of IVD cells (separated isolation of AFCs and NPCs) and \u00b5-\n\nCT imaging analysis (a total of four rabbits were sacrificed; 4 weeks old, ~1.3 Kg; 8 weeks old, \n\n~1.7 Kg; 9 weeks old, ~1.9 Kg; 10 weeks old: ~1.9 Kg). For each rabbit, the dorsal region was \n\nopened by 2 parallel sagittal scalpel cuts, one at each side of the vertebral column. When all the \n\ninternal dorsal tissues were cut the entire spine was lifted, both top and down extremities were \n\ncut, alongside with the ribs, in order to get the vertebral column loose. Furthermore, the internal \n\nventral tissues surrounding the spine were also cut, leaving it detached from the rest of the \n\nrabbit. The spine was separated into two segments with a scalpel incision in one of the middle-\n\nbottom thoracic IVDs (between T7 and T11 vertebrae) and placed in 50 mL conical tubes \n\nalready filled with 25 mL of 10% antimycotic and antibiotic solution (ATB) in phosphate \n\nbuffered saline (PBS) solution and placed at 4\u00baC until used. \n\nOne lower spine segment containing the lumbar IVDs was reserved for the \u00b5-CT \n\nanalysis, while the remaining spine segments were processed for IVD cells\u2019 isolation. Briefly, \n\nall muscle and ligament covering the thoracic and cervical spine segments were removed. A \n\nclean transverse scalpel cut was made in each IVD to allow access to the NP tissue. Bending the \n\ntwo adjacent vertebrae in opposing directions exposes the tissue. Furthermore, with the end of \n\nthe scalpel blade, the NP tissue alone, i.e., without pieces of AF or other adjacent tissues, was \n\nremoved and placed in a Falcon tube with 25 mL of PBS. In each IVD, after the NP tissue had \n\nbeen removed, both parts of the AF tissue were cut off from each corresponding cartilaginous \n\nendplate (CEP) with a scalpel, washed with PBS and placed in a conical tube with 25 mL of \n\nPBS. \n\nBoth types of cells/tissue suspension were centrifuged at 340 g for 3 minutes, at -4\u00baC. \n\nThe supernatant was discarded and the same PBS washing procedure was repeated 2 more \n\ntimes. The tissue fragments were then suspended in a solution containing the same proportions \n\nof Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium and nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM:F12; Invitrogen, \n\nUSA), with the pH adjusted to 7.4, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; \n\nAlfagene, USA), 1% (v/v) of ATB, and 0.25% (w/v) collagenase. The tubes were incubated at \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Enzymatic digestion time-points were collected \n\nevery hour, this procedure was made by filtrating the suspension using a 100 \u00b5m pore size cell \n\nstrainer and further centrifuge the solution at 340 g for 3 minutes, at -4\u00baC. Then, instead of \n\ndiscarding the centrifuge supernatant this was used to wash the remaining tissue trapped in the \n\nfilter in order to continue the enzymatic digestion. The pellet was re-suspended in medium and \n\ncentrifuged again in the same conditions. This washing process was repeated two more times. \n\nFinally, the pellet was re-suspended in medium and seeded in T25 flasks. The AF tissue \n\ndigestion retrieved more cells at the 4 hours\u2019 time-point while the NP tissue had a better \n\noutcome at the 2 hour time-point. By making several time-points while the digestion is \n\noccurring, instead of only doing one at the end of the digestion period (around 24 hours of \n\nenzymatic digestion), it avoids already freed cells to be exposed to the harsh enzymatic \n\nenvironment that greatly reduces the amount of sub-cultures before the cells lose significantly \n\ntheir native phenotype. Both cell types were expanded until the third or fourth passage before \n\neach culture assay, always having the medium replaced every second or third day. \n\nNote: During all isolation process, cells/tissues from different rabbits were always kept separate, \n\nas well as later on through the in vitro assessment. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Replicating the Annulus Fibrosus: Scaffold Preparation  \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Reverse Engineering of Rabbit Intervertebral Disc  \n\nThe imaging analysis and 3D modelling was performed on rabbit spine segments of the \n\nlumbar region, to access the design of the IVDs most commonly affected by IDD. After the \n\nspinal lumbar segments were extracted, the IVDs were separated from the spine segment by \n\nmaking scalpel straight incision alongside the CEPs and vertebrae, leaving the whole AF and \n\nNP tissues completely intact. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.1.1. Micro-Computed Tomography of Rabbit Intervertebral Discs: Acquisition \n\nThe designs of fresh IVDs were acquired by \u00b5-CT (Skyscan 1072; Skyscan, Belgium) \n\nfor two-dimensional (2D) raw (images that live in the YZ plane domain) imaging acquisition. \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\nThe analysis was processed with a final magnification of 13.18 \u00b5m/pixel, and with source \n\nparameters of voltage and intensity adjusted to 89 kV and 112 \u00b5A, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.1.2. Conversion and Processing of Raw 2D Images into 2D Stack Images \n\nThe NRecon software (Skyscan, Belgium) was used for processing the acquired raw 2D \n\nimages. Briefly, the areas that did not contain the IVD were discarded as much as possible \n\nthroughout the whole RE procedure. The grey-scale threshold was adjusted to only take into \n\naccount the pixels with grey between 80 and 255 grey-scale units (every pixel below 80 was \n\nturned into 0, i.e., black) to subtract any signal noise*. The images were processed for \n\nmisalignment (which had a starting value of -1.5), smoothing, ring artefact reduction, beam \n\nhardening correction and finally saved as 2D stack images (images that live in the XY spatial \n\nplane domain). Before segmentation for 3D modelling and to help on that following process, the \n\nimages were aligned using Dataviewer (Skyscan, Belgium). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n* The \u00b5-CT analysis emits a signal on one side (0\u00ba) of the acquisition chamber, which is collected on the \n\nother side (180\u00ba) of the acquisition chamber, after crossing the object being analysed. Depending on the \n\nmaterial\u2019s (being trespassed) density, the sensor detects from none (0 or 0%) to total (1 or 100%) the \n\namount of radiation being emitted. Thus, the amount of radiation reaching each small square that \n\ncomposes the sensor is converted into a number between 0 and 255 corresponding to the material\u2019s \n\ndensity, which is directly involved with the signal deviation. Generally the numbers are inversely \n\nproportional for the sake of intuition, since the lack of signal means that a higher density material is being \n\nanalysed, which in medical imaging generally indicates bone that is white. Therefore, 0% of the signal \n\nrecorded is generally represented as total white that is equal to 255 in the grey-scale while 100% signal \n\nrecording is represented in black and is equal to 0 in the grey-scale. In the end each image is composed of \n\na limited, but generally large (1024x1024 pixels), number of pixels all ranged in the grey-scale both \n\nrepresented by a type of grey and a number that is directly related to its original density. After 180\u00ba \n\nrotation during acquisition and several images acquired, e.g., 412 images if each step takes a rotation of \n\n0.45\u00ba, it is possible to process the images and process them into a 3D view composed of voxels that \n\nfollow the same representation logic of the pixels but have an additional space parameter (cubes instead \n\nof squares). \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n2.2.1.3. Three Dimensional Modelling \n\nThe segmentation process of the 2D stack images was performed using Mimics \n\nsoftware (Trial version; Materialise, Belgium) by creating only one mask, which was chosen to \n\ncover the appropriate pixels that enclosed the areas of interest in each 2D image, i.e., the areas \n\nrepresenting the AF and the NP. Therefore, the \u2018Threshold\u2019 tool was employed to mask the \n\npixels of interest, which are selected according with the specified range of tissue density \n\n(represented by a specified range within the grey-scale). Then, the raw 3D mesh was exported \n\nfrom the mask. \n\nIn this step, the raw 3D model file previously acquired using Mimics was then uploaded \n\nto the 3-Matic software (Trial version; Materialise, Belgium). The 3D model was analysed for \n\n\u2018dirty\u2019 Geometry, i.e., holes in the model\u2019s surface, inverted triangles, overlapping triangles and \n\nangles between elements smaller than 45? angle\n199\n\n. The holes were then closed. Triangles were \n\nreverted to an optimal position, i.e., the normal vectors of each inverted triangle were converted \n\nto a positive value. Overlapping triangles were substituted by one triangle or a set of well-\n\narranged triangles. Sets of triangles composed of angles smaller than 45? were replaced by a \n\nmore smother surface. Each one of the four tools herein described when applied can create \n\ndefects that must be corrected with the other tools, e.g., if holes are closed in a designated \n\nsurface, the process can easily create other defects such as: overlapping triangles, inverted \n\ntriangles, or even small angles. Therefore, this step is a positive spiral between the four \n\ncorrective domains until the whole surface is corrected, according with the four surface\u2019s error \n\ncheckers. Using different software could bring more or less surface\u2019s error checkers, which \n\nwould contribute to a more or less faithful RE process. \n\nAfter the mesh was created and corrected, it was smoothened until a desired resolution \n\ndetail, in order for the afterwards exported STL file to have a reasonable size for the RP \n\nequipment to be able to 3D print it. Too much model resolution stalls the rapid prototyping \n\nprocess without any extra benefit, since the resolution is conditioned by the rapid prototyping \n\nequipment\u2019s resolution (100 \u00b5m). With the 3D model optimized, several different pore \n\ngeometries were made on the top and down lids of the model, in order to make the interior \n\naccessible for medium to enter. These porosities were designed only on the two surfaces that are \n\nin contact with the vertebrae, in the native IVD, and even so they were restricted only to the NP \n\narea (in the middle of the surfaces following the 2D NP transaxial images). Also simplified \n\nversions of the vertebrae contact surfaces with the native IVD were also modelled to prepare the \n\ntop and down moulds of the IVD as adapting pieces that will allow, in future work, for the \n\nscaffold to be pressurized while in culture, in resemblance to the native cyclic pressurized \n\nconditions known to exist in the IVD. \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Rapid Prototyping of the Rabbit Intervertebral Disc\u2019s 3D Model  \n\nThe RP was made using a desktop 3D printer (Replicator 2; Makerbot, USA), which is \n\na fused deposition modelling (FDM) technology equipment. The AF scaffolds were printed in \n\nPCL (Flexible Filament; Makerbot, USA) at a fusion temperature of 100\u00baC. The parameters \n\nchosen in the 3D printing software (MakerWare; Makerbot, USA) were 1 shell, 100% infill, \n\n100\u00b5m layer height and 200% scale of the original rabbit IVD (still half the size of a human \n\nIVD, thus more challenging due to resolution limitations). The printing speed was established \n\nfor 45 mm per second of extrusion and 90 mm per second without extrusion. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3. Patient-Specific Annulus Fibrosus Scaffolds Assessment  \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Micro-Computed Tomography Analysis of the Replicas  \n\nThe PCL scaffolds were analysed by \u00b5-CT, following the same protocol described in \n\nthe x-ray 2D slices\u2019 acquisition of the fresh rabbit IVDs (please see \u201cMicro-Computed \n\nTomography of Rabbit Intervertebral Discs \u2013 Acquisition\u201d), with different parameter values, \n\nthough. The analysis magnification was set to 19.13 \u00b5m/pixel, and the electrical voltage and \n\ncurrent were adjusted to 37 kV and 226 \u00b5A, respectively. The resulting raw 2D images were \n\nprocessed also following the same protocol described above (please see \u201cMicro-Computed \n\nTomography of Rabbit Intervertebral Discs \u2013 Conversion and Processing of Raw 2D Images \n\ninto 2D Stack Images\u201d) with the slight change in the grey scale threshold selected, which was \n\nset between 40 and 255. \n\nMoreover, the CT Analyser software (Skyscan, Belgium) was used to further process \n\nand analyse the scaffolds\u2019 and native IVD\u2019s porosity and structure thickness. The processing \n\nsteps comprised (a) filtering of the Gaussian blur type (3D space) with a radius of 5.0, (b) again \n\ngrey-scale thresholding between 40 or 80 (scaffolds or native IVD, respectively) and 255 and \n\n(c) region-of-interest shrink-wrap mode (3D space) that stretches the model over holes with a \n\ndiameter less than 4 voxels. Furthermore, the 3D analysis was made to both replicas and native \n\nIVD after each processing. \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\nThe surface and porosity morphologies of the scaffold were assessed by scanning \n\nelectron microscopy (SEM), without any post-treatment (e.g., hydration, fixation) after 3D \n\nprinting. Though, they were mounted onto stubs with carbon double-sided tape and further gold \n\ncoated. The specimens were observed using SEM equipment (JSM-6010LV; JEOL, Japan) \n\noperating at 10 kV.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Mechanical Testing \n\nThe AF replica scaffolds were assessed for their mechanical properties using universal \n\nmechanical testing equipment (model 5543; Instron, USA). The surfaces of the test samples in \n\ncontact with the equipment\u2019s compression plates had to be plain for a homogeneous \n\ncompression of the whole scaffold. Therefore, in the segmentation process (see \u201cThree \n\nDimensional Modelling\u201d) the top and down surfaces were filled with mask until they became \n\nplain. \n\nMoreover, in order to calculate correctly the sample\u2019s mechanical properties they had to \n\nbe in a simple geometry, e.g., cylinder, cuboid, and prism. Thus, the scaffolds were punched \n\ninto a cylindrical shape with the largest diameter possible, which for all specimens varied \n\nbetween 9.8 and 10.1 mm in diameter and 6.6 and 7.0 mm in height. These measurements were \n\nmade to each sample before it was loaded into the equipment, to serve as input parameters in the \n\nequipment\u2019s software. \n\nThe samples were tested in dry and hydrated states, in which the second required the \n\nextra step of immersing the samples in PBS for 5 hours before the assessment. On both states, \n\nthe samples were conditioned at room temperature in a dry environment for at least 48 hours \n\nbefore being processed for assessment. The tests were performed under uniaxial compression \n\nand its Young\u2019s modulus was determined in the straightest linear region of the stress-strain \n\ngraph, by means of using the secant method. Each condition was assessed for six replicates. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n2.3.4. Scaffold\u2019s Cytotoxicity Assessment \n\nIn order to verify the possibility of using these AF scaffolds as a TE strategy, they were \n\nassessed for cytotoxicity. Therefore, AFCs and immortalized mouse L929 were independently \n\ncultured in 96-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plates at a cell density of 20 x 10\n3\n \n\ncells/well for 24 hours in chondrogenic medium solution of DMEM:F12 supplemented with \n\n10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) ATB, at 37\u00b0C and in 5% CO2 atmosphere. In the same time frame, \n\nboth PCL scaffolds and latex (negative control) were embedded independently in 20 ml of the \n\nsame type of culture medium in a quantity of 4 g and 120 cm\n2\n (less than 0.5 mm thick; \n\naccounting with the surface area of both sides: 2 x 60 cm\n2\n) clipped in 0.5 x 5 cm\n\n2\n sections, \n\nrespectively. Both extractions were run during 24 hours (in parallel with the cell\u2019s attachment to \n\nthe TCPS), in a water-bath, at 37\u00baC and with a shaking rate of 60 rpm. \n\nAfter the 24 hour period was complete, each extraction was filtered through a 0.45 Fm \n\nmembrane into a sterile conical tube. These mediums alongside with the medium without \n\nextraction (positive control) were added independently to the wells seeded with cells in the day \n\nbefore. All conditions were left in culture for 24 hours and 72 hours, after which the metabolic \n\nactivity profile was assessed. The experiments were performed by using twelve independent \n\nmeasurements per condition. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.4.1. MTS assay \n\nMTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-\n\ntetrazolium) assay was performed to assess the metabolic activity profile previously addressed. \n\nThe cultures were incubated in 350 \u00b5l of phenol red-free DMEM culture medium solution, with \n\nthe already mentioned supplements, together with CellTiter 96\n\u00ae\n Aqueous One Solution Reagent \n\n(Promega, USA), containing MTS reagent, at 5:1 ratio. The samples were incubated in the dark \n\nin a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2 for 3 hours. After the incubation period, 100 \n\n\u00b5L of the solution was transferred from each well in triplicate to a transparent 96-well plate. \n\nFurthermore, the optical density (OD) was determined at 490 nm, by Synergy HT multi-\n\ndetection microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, USA). The resulted OD for this type of assay \n\nis proportional to the cellular activity, being what is believed to be a measurement of the cell \n\nculture\u2019s total mitochondrial activity.  \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n\n2.4. Nucleus Pulposus Cell Construct Preparation  \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Methacrylated Gellan Gum Synthesis \n\nThe methacrylation of gellan gum was performed by reacting Low Acyl Gellan Gum \n\n(LA-GG; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) with Glycidyl Methcrylate 97% (GMA; Sigma-Aldrich, \n\nGermany) at 20-fold molar excess in respect to the repeating unit of LA-GG, as previously \n\ndescribed by Silva-Correia et al. (2010)\n105\n\n, and based on a study performed by Li and co-\n\nworkers (2003)\n200\n\n. Briefly, LA-GG was added to deionized water, at room temperature and \n\nunder vigorous agitation, with required quantities in order to achieve a final concentration of 1% \n\n(w/v). The solution was then heated until 90\u00baC, where it was maintained constant for 30 minutes \n\nto 1 hour, aiming to dissolve the LA-GG completely. The solution was allowed to cool down to \n\nroom temperature overnight. An appropriate amount of GMA was added to the solution, with \n\nthe objective of achieving a 20-fold molar excess in respect to the repeating unit of GG. The pH \n\nwas raised to 8.5 with 1 M sodium hydroxide (VWR, USA), and maintained constant during 24 \n\nhours, by means of using a micro syringe pump (Fusion 200; Chemyx Inc., USA). GG-MA was \n\nprecipitated by adding half the solution\u2019s volume of cold acetone (VWR, USA). Moreover, the \n\nsolution was dialysed against deionised water for 7 days using a cellulose membrane (MW \n\ncutoff 12 kDa; Sigma, USA), in order to remove the acetone and remaining GMA. Finally, the \n\nGG-MA was frozen at -80\u00baC overnight and lyophilised for 7 days to obtain it in the stable off-\n\nthe-shelf state of water-free foam. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.2. Preparation of Ionic Methacrylated Gellan Gum Hydrogel Discs \n\nThe lyophilised GG-MA was sterilized under an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere. The \n\nGG-MA solution was obtained by dissolving the lyophilised GG-MA in distilled water at a final \n\nconcentration of 1.5% (w/v), and left overnight under vigorous agitation at room temperature. In \n\norder to achieve the polymerized disc form (6 mm in diameter and ~3.5 mm in height; 100 \u00b5L \n\nin volume) the GG-MA solution was pipetted into a multidisc polycarbonate mould plate \n\n(moulds with 6 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height), and PBS was added over to plate with \n\nenough volume to cover the mould plate. The apparatus was left this way up to 30 minutes \n\naiming for ionic polymerization of the hydrogel. \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.3. In Vitro Culture Studies of Encapsulated Nucleus Pulposus Cells \n\n \n\n2.4.3.1. In vitro cellular encapsulation \n\nIn order to encapsulate NPCs within GG-MA discs, approximately 1 x 10\n7\n cells/mL \n\nwere re-suspended in 1.5% (w/v) GG-MA solution (prepared as previously described, prior to \n\nits polymerization). After homogeneous dispersion, the GG-MA cell suspension was inserted in \n\na polycarbonate mould being further polymerized as previously described. GG-MA discs in the \n\nabsence of cells were also prepared, to serve as negative control while in culture. \n\nThe GG-MA discs, with or without encapsulated NPCs, were further cultured in a \n\nchondrogenic medium solution of DMEM:F12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) \n\nATB, at 37\u00b0C and in 5% CO2 atmosphere for different periods of culture (depending on the type \n\nof assay performed afterwards), until up to 21 days. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.3.2. Live/Dead Viability and Adhesion Assay  \n\nCell adhesion and viability were investigated by Live/Dead assay, which consists on \n\nusing two types of probes namely calcein-AM (green; Molecular Probes, Life Technologies \n\nCorporation, USA)) and propidium iodide (red; Alfagene, USA) that marks live and dead cells, \n\nrespectively.  \n\nBriefly, the medium was removed and the samples were washed three times with PBS. \n\nThen, 1 mL of PBS solution containing 2 \u00b5g/mL of calcein-AM and 1 \u00b5g/mL of Propidium \n\nIodide was added to each well and left for 1 hour at 37\u00baC in a humidified atmosphere of CO2. \n\nMoreover, the samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axio Imager Z1m; \n\nZeiss, Germany). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n2.4.3.3. DNA quantification \n\nCell proliferation and viability were assessed by DNA quantification. Proliferation of \n\nNPCs cultured in GG-MA was evaluated after DNA quantification at defined culture times, \n\nnamely 0 and 24 hours, 7, 14 and 21 days of culture. The DNA of each culture was quantified \n\nby using the PicoGreen Quantification Kit (Invitrogen, USA). Picogreen has fluorescence \n\nproperties and binds to double-stranded DNA, therefore it allows measurement of the \n\nproportional fluorescence enhancement\n201\n\n. In each time-point each disc was transferred directly \n\nto an Eppendorf containing 1 mL of ultra-pure water (from ultra-pure water system Genpure \n\nUV/UF; TKA, Denmark) solution of 0.5% (w/v) NaOH.  \n\nThe third difference in the protocol already described was the use of the vortex to help \n\ndissolve the GG-MA just before leaving the samples overnight in the -80\u00baC freezer. The \n\nEppendorfs were put in a 37\u00baC water-bath during 1 hour, vortexed and left overnight at -80\u00baC in \n\na freezer. \n\nOn the next day, the 20X Tris-EDTA buffer solution, provided in the quantification kit, \n\nwas diluted upH2O at a 1:20 ratio (therefore resulting in a 1X Tris-EDTA buffer solution). 100 \n\n\u00b5L of this solution was transferred to each well of a 96-well white opaque plate (Corning, \n\nUSA). Moreover, the PicoGreen reagent (also provided in the kit) was diluted with the 1X Tris-\n\nEDTA buffer solution at a 1:200 ratio. Then, 71.3 \u00b5L of this PicoGreen solution was transferred \n\nto each well of the 96-well plate and finally 28.7 \u00b5L of each sample solution was transferred to \n\nthree wells (three pipetting replicates) of the 96-well plate and it was incubated for ten minutes \n\nprotected from direct light. Fluorescence was then read at 480/20 nm of excitation and 520/20 \n\nnm of emission in a Synergy HT microplate reader. A standard curve was made out of the \n\npicogreen kit\u2019s provided DNA vial (concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2% (w/v)) for \n\nextrapolation of the samples DNA concentration, according with read absorbance for each \n\nsample. Furthermore, a solution of 50 x 10\n5\n cells/mL was centrifuged and re-suspended in ultra-\n\npure water at the same concentration, and followed the same PicoGreen Quantification Kit \n\nprocedure. Therefore, allowing a relation between cell number and DNA concentration, in order \n\nto provide the cell number present in each sample.  All the experiments were replicated nine \n\ntimes per sample condition. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n2.4.3.4. MTS Assay \n\nThe metabolic activity of the NPCs encapsulated in the GG-MA discs was evaluated by \n\nMTS assay. The protocol followed for this assessment was the same as described above (see \n\n\u201cScaffold Biocompatibility\u201d), but instead of assessing cells attached to a 96-well plate the \n\nculture comprised the GG-MA disc constructs in 24-well plates for 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of \n\nculture. \n\nAdditionally, the viability of GG-MA discs was also evaluated for L929 cells \n\nencapsulated in GG-MA. Since GG-MA has been shown to have non-angiogenic properties, \n\nherein is assessed the metabolic activity of a fibroblast cell line in GG-MA, i.e., a cell type that \n\nrequires a great level of cell adhesion, in comparison with NPCs encapsulated in the same \n\nmaterial. All the experiments were replicated nine times per sample condition. \n\n  \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\n3. Results \n\n \n\n3.1. Reverse Engineering and Rapid Prototyping the Intervertebral Disc  \n\n \n\n3.1.1. Scaffold Preparation \n\nThe procedure of developing a customized IVD through RE and RP method would be \n\nbased on CT measurements of the patients. In this sense, aiming to observe the feasibility of this \n\nstrategy in the TE field, more precisely in the IVD regeneration, the \u00b5CT was used to acquire \n\nthe images to model the IVD design and afterwards analyse the PCL replica to compare the 2D \n\nimages of both analysis types and understand if the design is maintained after being produced \n\n(Figure 3.1). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1. Representation of the results acquired from the main steps of intervertebral disc reverse \n\nengineering and rapid prototyping techniques: (A) raw 2D images acquired from the rabbit IVD imaging \n\nanalysis (5 from a set of 412 images); (B) 2D stack images after dataset processing; (C) one of the 10 \n\nvirtual representation of the IVD replica model, specifically the \u201csmall pores\u201d model, 200% scale of the \n\noriginal native IVD; (D) photograph of the 3D printed geometrical model, 200% scale of the original \n\nIVD; (F) and (G) scaffold imaging acquisition and processing, respectively, 200% scale of the original \n\nIVD, analogues of (A) and (B); (E) fast rendering of the image dataset represented in (G). Scale bars \n\ncorrespond to 5 mm. \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nThus, the raw 2D images in Figure 3.1.A (412 images in total) show both the IVD and \n\nvertebral tissues from one native rabbit intervertebral motion unit, which when processed \n\ngenerates the 2D stack image dataset represented by the images in Figure 3.1.B (355 images in \n\ntotal). The rendering of this stack image dataset generates the 3D model replica of the native \n\nIVD. \n\nThe RP customized scaffold was prepared by uploading the 3D model onto the 3D \n\nprinter. The printed result is shown in Figure 3.1.D that was further analysed by the original \n\nimaging equipment used to acquire the native IVD raw images, as previously mentioned. The \n\nraw images of the scaffold are represented in Figure 3.1.F that when processed generated the \n\ndataset represented in Figure 3.1.G, which by fast rendering produced the model visualization \n\nshown in Figure 3.1.E. \n\nWhile using this method of RE and RP, several models based on the original AF \n\nscaffold were produced. Several types of porosity patterns were designed (in the segmentation \n\nstep), on the top and down lids of the scaffold over the NP cavity (located on the border of the \n\nIVD with the vertebrae in the original rabbit's IVDs) (Figure 3.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2. Virtual representation of IVD replica models designed with different porosities and \n\ncorrespondent photographs of the respective 3D printed scaffolds. Scale bar on the bottom right \n\ncorresponds to 5 mm for all virtual and 3D printed models, while corresponding to 3 mm for all SEM \n\nimages. \n\n \n\nA total of 9 different models (derivatives of the original replica model, which did not \n\nhave any superficial porosity) were prepared, and in order to analyse them, they were named: \n\n\u201cSmall Pores\u201d, \u201cMedium Pores\u201d, \u201cBig Pores\u201d, \u201cLines\u201d, \u201c4 Stripes\u201d, \u201c3 Stripes\u201d, \u201c4 Vertical \n\nLines\u201d, \u201cGrid\u201d and \u201cSquares\u201d, shown in Figure 3.2 from left to right and from top to bottom, \n\nrespectively. \n\nThe radial surface morphology of the scaffolds was recorded by SEM (Figure 3.3). The \n\nSEM results unveil the filament morphology deposited during the 3D printing process that \n\notherwise is not noticeable by naked eye. It is also possible to observe the high integration \n\nbetween the several deposited layers, as well as the resolution between layers (100 \u00b5m). \n\n \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3. SEM images from the lateral sides of the annulus fibrosus replica: right side of the sagittal \n\nplane (on top; scale bar: 500 \u00b5m), with higher magnification (in the middle; scale bar 100 \u00b5m) and ventral \n\nside of the coronal plane, which comprise the last layers of the 3D printing process (on the bottom; scale \n\nbar 500 \u00b5m). \n\n \n\nAdditionally, in the research perspective regarding this method, thinking in future \n\npressurized cultures, the top and down surface casts of the IVD model were also rendered, \n\nrepresenting the models of the top and down surfaces of the vertebrae in contact with the \n\noriginal IVD. Also, each type of porosity designed in the IVD models was imprinted on the top \n\nand down moulds, for each model. With this apparatus composed of three pieces, shown in \n\nFigure 3.4., it is possible to culture the scaffold under anatomy-like cyclic and uniformly \n\ndistributed compression (the top and down surfaces are naturally far from flat), while allowing \n\nfor the culture medium to access the NP cavity through the porosity. \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4.

With this purpose in mind, the 9 different models were also 3D analysed, which \n\nresults for average pore size and percentage of bulk material within the object\u2019s volume are \n\nexpressed in Figure 3.5. The porosities for each scaffold were 0.027%, 0.018%, 0.042%, \n\n0.010%, 0.030%, 0.017%, 0.016%, 7.132% and 0.021% for the \u201c3 Stripes\u201d, \u201c4 Stripes\u201d, \u201c4 \n\nVertical Lines\u201d, \u201cBig Pores\u201d, \u201cGrid\u201d, \u201cLines\u201d, \u201cMedium Pores\u201d, \u201cSmall Pores\u201d and \u201cSquares\u201d \n\nmodels, respectively.

Average pore size within each three-dimensional printed model and rabbit intervertebral disc. \n\n \n\nThe analysis was set to ignore macroscopic pores over a certain size. Therefore, the \n\ndesigned porosities did not contribute to these results since they can be viewed by naked eye. \n\nBut the pores designed in the \u201csmall pores\u201d design were small enough to be detected in the 3D \n\nanalysis, which measured in average 1289 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n \n\n3.1.3. Mechanical Tests \n\nMechanical tests were performed for each condition, being homogeneously compressed \n\nuntil 1 kN of uniaxial load (~105 MPa tension in the specimens\u2019 surface). The compressive load \n\nrequired to deform each specimen until 15% strain (deformation). Figure 3.6 shows the \n\nspecimens\u2019 mechanical behaviour, of both dry and hydrated states, represented as stress-strain \n\ncurves, with corresponding linear functions of the elastic domain and yield points. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6.

In vitro assessment of nucleus pulpous cells viability, adhesion and \n\nproliferation  \n\n \n\nThe cellular behaviour of NPCs, regarding their properties of adhesion, proliferation \n\nand viability within GG-MA, was assessed after performing Live/Dead staining, cellular activity \n\nprofile and DNA quantification, at specific time-points. For this purpose, both NPCs and L929 \n\ncells were encapsulated (separately) in GG-MA with a final cell concentration of 10 million \n\ncells per mL of hydrogel. In this sense, the viability after 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days in culture was \n\nanalysed by Live/Dead assay (Figure 3.10).  \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10. Live/Dead viability assay of L929 (on the left) cells and rabbit nucleus pulposus cells (on \n\nthe right) in GG-MA discs examined under fluorescence microscopy at: 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. All scale \n\nbars correspond to 200 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\nThe Live/Dead staining, marks viable cells\u2019 population as a strong green fluorescence \n\nwhile the dead cells are marked in red fluorescence. These results seem to show a reduction of \n\ndead cells in the first 3 days of culture (Figure 3.10; both cell types at 1 and 3 days), which is \n\nalmost unnoticeable after 7 days (Figure 3.10; both cell types at 7 days), i.e., the rate of cell \n\ndeath decreases over time. After 14 and 21 days of culture each cell type has different results. \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\nThe L929 cells do not show (Figure 3.10; L929 cells in GG-MA at 14 and 21 days), apparently, \n\nsigns of dead cells, only alive cells. Concerning the NPCs culture on the other hand, it is \n\nnoticeable a decrease in the number of viable cells until the final time-point of 21 days, where it \n\nis visualized an even balance between live and dead cells (Figure 3.10; NPCs in GG-MA at 14 \n\nand 21 days).  \n\nIn order to corroborate the previous results, the cumulative amount of DNA existent in \n\nculture at several time-points of 0, 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of culture, was quantified (Figure 3.11).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11. DNA content of rabbit nucleus pulposus cells seeded within GG-MA and cultured for 0, 1, \n\n7, 14 and 21 days. Results expressed as an average \u00b1 standard deviation; n = 9. By one-way ANOVA, \n\nvariances of each time-point were analysed with all others with the assuming (null hypothesis) unequal \n\nvariances, p-values were: 0d vs all as well as 1d vs 14d and 21d - P<0.001; 7d vs 21d \u2013 P<0.05; 1d vs 7d, \n\n7d vs 14d and 14d vs 21d \u2013 P>0.05. \n\n \n\nResults indicated that NPCs cultured in GG-MA did not proliferate between 0 and 24 \n\nhours of culture. Furthermore, by observing the remaining three time-points, a stabilisation can \n\nbe observed. Although the NPCs concentration within the GG-MA discs is always decreasing \n\nalong with time, the cell number difference between time-points gets smaller and smaller, \n\nvarying between 14 and 21 days by 5.1 x 10\n4\n cells, while between 0 and 24 hours there was a \n\ndecrease of 2.9 x 10\n5\n cells/disc. The 21 days\u2019 time-point retrieved a cell number of 4.2 x 10\n\n5\n \n\ncells/disc. \n\nThe cellular proliferation of both L929 cells and NPCs was assessed via quantification \n\nof their metabolic activity at 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of culture. Figure 3.12 shows the cellular \n\nactivity for both cell types encapsulated in GG-MA, with a concentration of 1 million cells per \n\ndisc, and 1 x 10\n4\n cells growing in TCPS 6-well plates without GG-MA. \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12.

At 21 days\u2019 time-point the metabolic activity was similar, though \n\nslightly higher, than the 7 days result. \n\nRegarding the metabolic activity of NPCs cultured in TCPS well plate, it remained \n\nstatistically the same at time-points of 1 and 7 days of culture. Though, after another 7 days of \n\nculture (14 days\u2019 time-point) the metabolic activity was ~236% higher. Moreover, by day 21 of \n\nculture the optical density decreased to ~43% in relation to the optical density observed at 14 \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\ndays\u2019 time-point. Nevertheless, still the double of the first two time-points (1 and 7 days of \n\nculture). \n\n  \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n4. Discussion \n\n \n\nThe current work aims to provide a new strategy for the setup of a TE-TDR construct. \n\nNot only that, but the final construct must, from macro- to microscopic level, faithfully and \n\nspecifically replicate the native patient\u2019s IVD as it was when not degenerated. With this in \n\nmind, it was hypothesized that the combination of RE with RP together with TE would be a \n\npromising approach to achieve not only an immunocompatible cell construct, but also a \n\nstructurally compatible IVD scaffold that fits precisely within the intervertebral space. Most \n\ncases of LBP caused by IDD already are in a medium to a severe state of degeneration when the \n\npatient arrive to the clinics (LBP is felt when a hernia presses adjacent nerves or when nerve \n\nendings grow inside the IVD)\n202\n\n. This means that the AF tissue is already compromised, \n\ntherefore any hydrogel carrying cells with the objective of regenerating the NP cannot be held \n\nby the native AF, and herniates producing more LBP. Thus, a more complete, though not \n\nnecessarily complex, TE strategy must be followed in order to treat these cases, which includes \n\na scaffold that replaces and regenerates the AF tissue. Due to the AF\u2019s biochemical and \n\nbiomechanical properties, it is expected for the scaffold to have elastic properties similar to the \n\nnative natural structure and must degrade at the same rate as the new AF tissue is synthesised by \n\nthe AFCs. \n\nFor this purpose, two complementary pathways were followed, one that comprises the \n\nregeneration of the AF and the other for the NP. Though, the final purpose is to combine both \n\nstrategies in order to prepare a TE-TDR implant composed by a PCL scaffold, replicating the \n\nouter surface of the AF, filled with NPCs encapsulated in GG-MA hydrogels.  In the future, this \n\nnovel strategy is envisaged to treat IDD, and remove LBP, by fully regenerating the \n\nintervertebral disc. In another side of the same approach, this work aims as well to reinforce the \n\nfeasibility of GG-MA hydrogels as a potential support for NPCs. \n\nSeveral research groups are tuning up new strategies to regenerate the IVD\n146\u2013148,151\u2013\n\n155,157,158,161,162,169,170,172,196,203\u2013208\n, but most of them render to mimic the IVD shape\n\n152\n, however \n\nthey are not focused on patient-specificity. Not withstanding, every patient has different \n\nintervertebral geometric characteristics, and if this geometry is replicated into the implanted \n\nconstruct there is an increased possibility that it is successfully integrated. This geometrical \n\npatient-specificity can be achieved without extra costs (in relation to other TE strategies), just \n\nby using the patient\u2019s data already being acquired during standard diagnostic procedures. In \n\nfact, anatomical modelling can be performed by classical design-parametric features, using \n\nseveral types of computer aided design (CAD) software. Another possibility is the use of RE to \n\nconvert the real system into a 3D virtual solid. In this sense, RE is presented as a process that is \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\nfocused on the creation of a CAD model from a physical model aiming to use the geometric \n\nmodel for its manufacturing. The first step of RE is focused on the data acquisition through non-\n\ninvasive imaging techniques, commonly used in the hospital environment for diagnosis, namely \n\nCT or MRI technology, these models are further generated by 3D-image-based reconstruction \n\nsoftware, such as Mimics. The 3D model is parameterized and used as a reference model for \n\ncreating patient-specific anatomical models based on dimensions extracted from radiographic \n\nimages. \n\nThis study describes a novel method for producing IVD scaffolds using RE and RP \n\ntechniques. The underlying idea behind this method was proposed envisioning the possibility to \n\nprepare customized scaffolds for each patient individually, as previously mentioned. Herein, the \n\nRE process is in association with the RP technology of 3D printing by FDM, which does not \n\nrequire any solvent and offers great ease and flexibility in material handling and processing. The \n\nuse of a filament modelling material also reduces its residence time in the heating compartment \n\nand allows continuous production without the need of replacing feedstock\n209\n\n. Moreover, this \n\ntechnique enables a very fast and low-cost method of producing scaffolds in a precise manner \n\n(resolution = 100 \u00b5m) regarding what the CAD model represents virtually.  \n\nWhen a patient with LBP arrives to the medical doctor\u2019s office to understand and treat \n\nhis source of pain, he is advised, among other things, to be submitted to a CT or a magnetic \n\nresonance imaging (MRI) for diagnostic purposes. For the cases of IVD degeneration these \n\nimages can have another purpose, and this is where the present work picks on. The stack images \n\nobtained by the imaging system are segmented into a 3D model that is the virtual replica of the \n\npatient\u2019s IVD. This 3D model, after some modelling treatment can then be uploaded to a low-\n\ncost RP FDM 3D printer that prepares a faithful replica (from 100 \u00b5m to the macroscopic level) \n\nof the patient\u2019s IVD in the desired biomaterial (any given biomaterial suitable for FDM 3D \n\nprinting). By comparing the Figures 3.1.B and G it is possible to observe the pattern \n\nresemblance that in B is the shadow regions and in G are the bright regions, both representing \n\nthe IVD volume, native and replica respectively. The centre image in Figure 3.1.G reveals the \n\nNP cavity that is not noticeable in the native image dataset, though the respective cavity volume \n\nwas designed according with the grey-scale threshold, which left a lighter \u201cpixel fog\u201d over the \n\nshown cavity region. This voxels were removed to avoid unnecessary heavy processing of the \n\nmodel in the 3D printer software, since voxels are ~14 \u00b5m of side they are not expressed unless \n\nwhen in groups of at least 7 x 7 x 7 cubic voxels (343 voxels altogether) due to the 3D printer \n\nresolution limitation. \n\nSeveral porosities were designed in the resulting IVD replica generating several 3D \n\nmodels that were afterwards 3D printed. There were some porosity patterns that could be \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\ntransposed from the virtual model to the real object, though some could not, it mainly depended \n\nof the resolution required by the pattern and the orientation of the scaffold while being prepared, \n\nsince FDM technology is conditioned by gravity. The IVD replica 3D model does not include \n\nthe NP volume (i.e., the model is hollow), thus, if the scaffold was printed in anatomically IVD-\n\nlike position, the top lid (over the NP cavity) would collapse on the bottom lid (below the NP \n\ncavity) before the PCL could solidify due to lack of support for the fused PCL being extruded. \n\nThis creates the need to add support material inside the scaffold, i.e., material not represented in \n\nthe CAD model that is needed for the object generation, which would compromise the \n\nmechanical behaviour (and probably the biocompatibility of the final construct) of the scaffold \n\nif not removed. Therefore the scaffold was turned 90\u00ba from anterior transverse plane to inferior \n\ncoronal plane, which allowed the preparation of at least 6 of the 9 porosity patterns with high \n\nmatching degree. These porosities, in a future work, will be assessed for permeability to analyse \n\nwhich porosity better matches with the native IVD range of permeability. The non-reproduced \n\nprecision details that were not transposed from the virtual model to real 3D printed object could \n\nbe easily overcome if the RP system was a stereolithography (SLA) system, due to its higher \n\nresolution. However, it addresses the limitation of narrowing the range of source material \n\navailable. The material needs to be photo-polymerizable that for PCL means the need to use \n\nphoto-initiator, which can create a whole new set of challenges, e.g., cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, \n\nit is an interesting idea to explore as well, since it enables a higher degree of resolution and does \n\nnot rely directly on gravity in the solidifying site.   \n\nHerein, PCL was proposed for this procedure due to its mechanical properties, \n\nspecifically its elastic domain at physiological temperature. Since the RP process will only \n\nreplicate the solid part of the native IVD, i.e., the AF, the substitution material should have a \n\ndegree of elasticity AF-like. The PCL has been proposed for AF regeneration by several \n\nresearch groups\n167,172,210\n\n. This polymer possesses a very low melting point (~60\u00baC) that confers \n\nit a greater elastic domain than other polymers at 37\u00baC. This is an ideal property for an AF \n\nscaffold to have, since it must be able to sustain not only one big load, but rather several loading \n\ncycles. Therefore, it cannot sustain a loading force for the sake of plastic deformation, it must be \n\nable to be subjected to the loading and afterwards return to the original morphology, remaining \n\nready to absorb the next loading cycle. Thus, it shall never go into plastic deformation by \n\nsustaining the pressure before reaching the Yield Point, otherwise the material will suffer from \n\nmechanical fatigue that ultimately leads to fracture. \n\nBest et al. measured the compressive elastic modulus of the AF by confined \n\ncompression, the resulting modulus was 0.38 MPa\n211\n\n. Umehara et al. demonstrated that the \n\ncompressive modulus of the AF was 0.11 MPa\n212\n\n. The compressive young\u2019s modulus of the \n\nproduced IVD scaffolds in dry and hydrated state was 72 MPa and 77 MPa, respectively. \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\nComparing to the native AF elastic modulus, it was observed a higher compressive young\u2019s \n\nmodulus, however, considering that the produced scaffold presents a compact structure, it shows \n\nthat in the future it would be possible to create more porous in this structure. In this study, the \n\nRP process was programmed to infill the AF volume 100%, this parameter can be lowered, \n\nwhich will probably decrease the Young\u2019s modulus exponentially. Moreover, as previously \n\nmentioned, the scaffold is made of PCL that presents a melting point of about 60\u00baC, thus if the \n\nmechanical tests were performed at physiological temperature (37\u00baC) instead of room \n\ntemperature (~20\u00baC) the resulting elastic modulus would be lower.  \n\nThese compressive modulus values (72 MPa and 77 MPa), for both states, can be \n\nconsidered very close, which shows how predictable and stable these scaffolds are, being in \n\naccordance with Lebourg et al. results, whom tested mechanically PCL electrospun scaffolds\n213\n\n. \n\nAlthough, this similarity in the mechanical behaviour between both states was already expected \n\ndue to the hydrophobic nature of this material\n214\n\n. Moreover, the porosity results express that the \n\nempty volume inside the scaffolds is an average of 0.023% (not considering the NP cavity). \n\nTherefore, suggesting that the NP cavity is the key feature responsible for the difference \n\nbetween compressive modulus by being filled when the scaffold is hydrated. \n\nAlongside with its good mechanical properties, the PCL degrades into non-acidic \n\nbyproducts\n172\n\n. In this sense, the biocompatibility of the 3D PCL IVD scaffolds was also \n\nassessed. The mitochondrial activity, measured via MTS assay, at 24 and 72 hours produced an \n\noptical density between 81% and 85% in relation to the positive control, thus suggesting a good \n\ndegree of biocompatibility.  In fact, this result is not surprising since this parameter was already \n\nreported. Koepsell et al. prepared electrospun nanofibrous PCL scaffolds for AF TE, although  \n\nit was not performed a cytotoxic assessment, the in vitro studies shown an increased AFCs\u2019 \n\nproliferation and activity along with culture time suggesting biocompatibility\n210\n\n. Wan et al. \n\nprepared an IVD construct in which the inner AF scaffold was composed of poly-\n\n(polycaprolactone triol malate). The biocompatibility evaluation using mice as a model revealed \n\nno obvious immunological reaction after 1 week\n172\n\n. Similar status results were also shown in \n\nother studies for bone\n215\n\n, cartilage\n216\n\n, cardiac\n217\n\n, vascular\n218\n\n and skin TE\n219\n\n. \n\nAs previously mentioned, the AF scaffold is hollow inside since a cavity, which \n\nreplicates the NP design, is left in the 3D printing process envisioning that afterwards an \n\ninjectable hydrogel containing patient\u2019s NPCs could be introduced in this cavity. Therefore, and \n\ncontinuing the parallelism with what happens nowadays in the clinics regarding an IVD \n\ndegeneration condition, when the patient is submitted to a discectomy (procedure for a disc \n\nhernia removal) the tissue instead of being discarded is kept for NPCs isolation. These cells, \n\nafter expansion or not (second surgery vs. NPCs availability), can be encapsulated within the \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\nhydrogel and further injected in the hollow part of the PCL AF scaffold. If no cell expansion is \n\nneeded, the AF scaffold can be prepared between diagnosis and surgery, and the NPCs\u2019 \n\nencapsulation in the hydrogel would be performed in the operating theatre and further injected \n\nin the AF scaffold. Then the TE-TDR construct can be implanted in the same procedure as the \n\ndiscectomy (which would, naturally, seize to be a discectomy). If not, then a second surgery \n\nwould be needed, as it is nowadays for recurrent disc herniations that ultimately lead to a spinal \n\nfusion\n220\n\n. \n\nIonic-polymerized low acyl GG hydrogels have been proposed by 3B\u2019s Research Group \n\nfor TE strategies\n121,140,144,221\n\n. In fact, this GG based material was chosen as a carrier for NPCs for \n\nseveral reasons. What seems to be the one characteristic that distinguishes GG from other \n\nhydrogels is its non-angiogenic property\n59\n\n. The GG is a hydrogel with low cell adhesion \n\ncharacteristics, thus unwanted cell types, which generally require strong attachment to the \n\nsurrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), or biomaterial, do not migrate and proliferate in the \n\nGG. Therefore, angiogenesis is avoided inside the replaced IVD, which is essential for an NP \n\nTE strategy, since avascularity stimulates NPC phenotype expression\n52,53\n\n. Moreover, the GG can \n\nbe submitted to a methacrylation reaction with glycidyl methacrylate, and by controlling the \n\ntime of this reaction it is possible to tailor the desired mechanical properties\n121\n\n. When \n\nmethacrylation is preformed to GG, the final product is a mixture of GG and GG-MA, therefore \n\nthe more time the methacrylation reaction occurs the more amount of GG-MA will be present in \n\nthe final material. In fact, by allowing the GG to react with glycidyl methacrylate for 24 hours, \n\nthe resulting material has a storage modulus of 89.5\u00b17.4 kPa, resulting in more favourable \n\nmechanical properties than regular GG that is 56.2\u00b11.4 kPa\n144\n\n. Briefly, the storage modulus is \n\nthe ability for the material to retain mechanical energy, subjected to it, before reacting to the \n\nmechanical stimulus. In the other hand, the NP is an extremely hydrated tissue, thus the material \n\nchosen to replace must have good hydrophilic properties. GG-MA is able to polymerize with \n\n1.5% (w/v) concentration, thus the remaining 98.5% is water. It is interesting how this material \n\ncan hold more water than the NP and still have similar mechanical properties. Therefore, the \n\nGG-MA seems a promising material to be used not only for IVD regeneration but also for other \n\nTE purposes. \n\nThe in vitro assessment follows the results obtained in previous studies\n105,144\n\n, in which \n\nthe biocompatibility of GG-MA was tested with L929 cell line and human IVD cells by calcein-\n\nAM staining and cytotoxicity assay. Herein, the viability, proliferation, metabolic activity and \n\nqualitative characterization of rabbit NPCs encapsulated in GG-MA were assessed. \n\nFurthermore, L929 cells were also encapsulated within GG-MA hydrogels in order to compare \n\nthe metabolic activity of NPCs with a more adherence requiring cell type. Results of DNA \n\nquantification and Live/Dead assay for the culture of NPCs in GG-MA show great cell loss after \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\nthe first day of culture. This may be due to the encapsulation process that takes some time, and \n\nwhile it is being followed, the cells are out of the incubator at room temperature, being exposed \n\nto harsh conditions (e.g., centrifuge process, lack of medium supply, and absence of adherent \n\nsurface). Therefore, this process consumes a great number of cells not directly, but due to \n\nencapsulation cell stress that can increase cell death in the first 24 hours, which was confirmed \n\nby the Live/Dead results, which after one day of culture showed a high number of dead (red) \n\ncells. These results are corroborated by DNA quantification, since it shows a decrease from 1 x \n\n10\n6\n cells to 6.9 x 10\n\n5\n cells, corresponding to a decrease of cell number in approximately 30%. \n\nOn the other hand, the metabolic activity was higher than any other time-point, suggesting \n\nmetabolic activity triggered by encapsulation stress. However, after this short time, very few \n\ndead cells were noticed, being corroborated by the DNA quantification results. Surprisingly, the \n\nL929 cells in GG-MA culture was metabolically less active than NPCs, what was not expected \n\nsince L929 are generally used as a positive control population thus retrieving higher results. As \n\npreviously reported, GG-MA may be selective to different cell types, since this hydrogel has \n\nbeen shown to be not ideal for high adherent cell types. Thus, it is foreseen as a good platform \n\nfor NP regeneration, since it does not allow the contamination by high adherence cells types, \n\nsuch as the IVD in relation to angiogenesis and fibroblast-like cells migrating from the AF. \n\nTherefore, these results are in accordance with what was reported by Silva-Correia et al. in \n\nwhich the non-angiogenic properties of the GG-MA are demonstrated\n139\n\n. \n\nIn this work, a concentration of 1 x 10\n7\n cells/mL of GG-MA was used, since it is the \n\nadopted cell density described in the literature of NP regeneration strategies\n8\n. In this study, it \n\nwas observed a decrease in cell number along with the time, thus suggesting that the initial cell \n\nseeding number is too high for these culture conditions (i.e., 20% oxygen and unpressurized \n\nenvironment), since like in a degenerated NP the cell number decreases with normoxia \n\nconditions\n48,52,53,222\n\n. Therefore, without pressure environment and hypoxia stimulus, the seeding \n\nnumber of cells cannot be sustained, decreasing successively until a balanced cell concentration \n\nis achieved. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\n5. Concluding Remarks and Future work \n\n \n\nThe aim of this work was to develop a therapeutic TE strategy in a patient specific \n\nperspective. Thus, theoretically it is possible to apply this strategy by using the data acquired for \n\nIDD or hernia diagnosis alongside with a patient\u2019s cell source, whether NPCs harvested in \n\ndiscectomy surgery or stem cells. \n\nThe designed scaffold can be changed according to the native AF morphology, by \n\nreplicating the lamellar structure, which can be prepared by 3D printing with equipment that \n\npossesses higher precision, such as SLA 3D printing. Probably in the next couple of years FDM \n\n3D printers will start to have higher resolution, i.e., below 100 \u00b5m, and if a 50 \u00b5m is possible, \n\nthe lamellar structure can be replicated through RE and the whole scaffold may have a \n\nmechanical behaviour similar to the native AF. Moreover, with lamellar structure or with a \n\nlower infill it brings the opportunity to inject AFCs in this new porosity, allowing co-culture in \n\nvitro studies aiming to compare an acellular with cellular strategy (e.g., AFCs seeded on the 3D \n\nprinted scaffold) alongside with encapsulated NPCs in GG-MA hydrogels in the NP cavity. In \n\nthe future, if technology permits the possibility of 3D printing the design of the lamellas in the \n\nscaffold, after culturing the full TE-TDR under compression stimulus it will be interesting to \n\nassess if there will be aligned growth of collagen type I filaments between the scaffolding \n\nlamellas. \n\nThis work serves as baseline data for future studies focused on culturing this cells + TE-\n\nTDR construct under a pressurised system, using the vertebral surface casts, in a hypoxia \n\nenvironment coupled with transforming growth factor-?3 supplement, aiming to promote and \n\nmaintain the NPCs phenotype. \n\nMoreover, different features can be coupled with the present strategy, namely the \n\nexploitation of the piezoelectric phenomena, which is an intrinsic property of collagen type I \n\nand II, known to be the protein basis of the IVD\u2019s ECM.  A conductive PCL composite can be \n\nalso used to stimulate electrotaxis precisely where it is needed while maintaining good \n\nmechanical properties and biocompatibility. Thus, electrical stimulus can be used to encourage \n\nAFC\u2019s to synthesise ECM in a native like alignment. The subjacent idea would be to induce the \n\nproduction of the first synthesized ECM in a native morphology to increase significantly the \n\ncorrect maturation of the cells + scaffold construct in vivo.  \n\nIn fact, a solid approach to achieve a truly reliable IVD TE strategy would use the \n\nfollowing steps: \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\n? GF\u2019s cocktail optimization for MSCs differentiation into NPCs, and further \n\nencapsulation of both (GF\u2019s cocktail and MSCs) in GG-MA; \n\n? Model and design a patient specific AF scaffold with a precise native-like \n\nlamellar structure with an electroconductive PCL composite; \n\n? Inject a hydrogel, e.g., a blend of GG-MA with silk hydrogel, containing AFCs, \n\nin the interlamellar spaces; \n\n? Inject the GG-MA containing MSCs and GFs in the NP region of the scaffold; \n\n? Culture this construct in a bioreactor, adapted with vertebrae casts (for \n\nhomogeneous mechanical stress distribution), with 2% oxygen and under cyclic \n\npressure until biological stabilization is achieved; \n\n? Implantation of the construct in vivo. \n\nFortunately, there is no lack of ideas for trying to achieve a functional TE strategy to \n\nregenerate the IVD. The authors strongly believe that in the near future there will be a feasible \n\nTE strategy for the IVD in the clinics with the potential to overcome IDD. \n\n  \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n98 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\nIII.
