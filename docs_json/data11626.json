Mathematical Modeling for Drilling Optimization in Pre-salt Sections: \n\na Focus on South Atlantic Ocean Operations. 2016. 135 p. Doctorate Thesis (Doctorate in \n\nMechanical Engineering). Faculdade de Engenharia - Campus de Guaratinguet\u00e1, Universidade \n\nEstadual Paulista, Guaratinguet\u00e1-SP, 2016. \n \n\nABSTRACT \n \n\nPre-salt basins and their exploration have become more and more frequently mentioned over \n\nthe years, not just for their potential reserves, but also for the implicit challenges in terms of \n\noperations to face in order to make these fields commercially viable. Several research efforts \n\naimed at addressing these related barriers, in which drilling optimization and efficiency are \n\npresented as a considerably complex area. The problematic is concentrated in the low \n\ndrillability and in the high cost involved when drilling the pre-salt carbonates. \n \n\nThe outcome of this research is based in studies performed on top of eight pre-salt wells, \n\naddressing drilling operational time savings referenced by benchmarks and drilling mechanics \n\nparameters choosiness. The studies were based on simulations performed with penetration rate \n\n(ROP) modeling combined with specific energy (SE). The Bourgoyne Jr. and Young Jr. (1974) \n\nROP model was used given the high errors presented for the other models, higher than 40% \n\nand, in terms of SE, the formulations from Teale (1965) and Pessier et al. (1992) were used. All \n\nthese classic literature are still present in the industry and the software Oracle Crystal Ball was \n\nused as a supportive tool for the simulations. \n \n\nThis research yielded four important results: 1) the polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) is \n\nthe most suitable drill-bit choice for pre-salt, presenting the lowest teeth-cutters wear rate, 0.28 \n\n[%/ m]; 2) the possible spare in operational time encountered for the pre-salt operations \n\nrepresent a saving of approximately 13,747,550.00 [USD] for the analyzed pre-salt wells; 3) \n\nthe final mathematical model developed, after the adjustments for pre-salt, foresee an \n\nimprovement dropping the relative error from 36.52% to 23.12% in terms of comparing the \n\ncalculated and modeled ROP with the field measured ROP; 4) the final model yielded from the \n\ncombination of the ROP and SE formulations is the most adequate to be used in the industry, \n\nsince it was possible to foresee an improvement by dropping the relative error even more, from \n\n23.12% to 21.2%. \n \n\nKEYWORDS: Drilling.

V\u00e1rias pesquisas v\u00eam sendo desenvolvidas visando contornar estas \n\nbarreiras, das quais a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o e efici\u00eancia de perfura\u00e7\u00e3o se apresentam como uma \u00e1rea \n\nconsideravelmente complexa. A problem\u00e1tica se concentra nas baixas taxas de penetra\u00e7\u00e3o e no \n\nalto custo envolvido ao se perfurar as se\u00e7\u00f5es dos carbonatos do pr\u00e9-sal. \n \n\nOs resultados da pesquisa apresentados nesta tese baseiam-se em an\u00e1lises com oito po\u00e7os do \n\npr\u00e9-sal, abordando economia de tempo operacional com base em an\u00e1lises referenciadas em \n\nbenchmarks e escolhas de par\u00e2metros mec\u00e2nicos de perfura\u00e7\u00e3o. Os estudos foram baseados em \n\nsimula\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas com modelagem de taxa de penetra\u00e7\u00e3o (ROP) combinadas com energia \n\nespec\u00edfica (SE). Utilizou-se o modelo de ROP de Bourgoyne Jr.e Young Jr. (1974) face aos \n\naltos erros apresentados pelos outros modelos, superiores a 40% e, em termos de SE, utilizou-\n\nse o equacionamento de Teale (1965) e Pessier et al. (1992). Todas estas literaturas classicas \n\nainda est\u00e3o presentes na ind\u00fastria e o software Oracle Crystal Ball foi utilizado como uma \n\nferramenta de apoio para as simula\u00e7\u00f5es. \n \n\nOs resultados deste trabalho mostraram quatro conclus\u00f5es importantes: 1) a broca de perfura\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo tipo polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) \u00e9 a mais adequada para o pr\u00e9-sal, apresentando \n\numa taxa de desgaste de dentes-cortadores de 0.28 [%/ m]; 2) a poss\u00edvel diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de tempo \n\nde opera\u00e7\u00e3o encontrada ap\u00f3s an\u00e1lises de performance de opera\u00e7\u00e3o pode resultar em uma \n\neconomia de aproximadamente 13,747,550.00 [USD] para os po\u00e7os do pr\u00e9-sal analisados; 3) o \n\nmodelo matem\u00e1tico final desenvolvido, ap\u00f3s os ajustes para o pr\u00e9-sal, pode garantir uma \n\nmelhoria do erro relativo de 36.52% para 23.12% em termos de compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre o ROP \n\ncalculado e o ROP medido durante a atividade no campo; 4) o modelo final como resultado da \n\njun\u00e7\u00e3o do equacionamento de ROP e SE \u00e9 o mais adequado para a ind\u00fastria, uma vez que foi \n\nposs\u00edvel garantir uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o ainda maior do erro relative, de 23.12% para 21.2%. \n \n\nPALAVRAS-CHAVE: Perfura\u00e7\u00e3o.

Several research efforts aimed at addressing these related barriers, but the known \n\nchallenges of drilling optimization and efficiency resulted from considerably low drillability \n\nthroughout the pre-salt carbonates is still present. The pre-salt market trend has been frequently \n\nexplored over the years in Brazil and in Angola and, considering these countries\u2019 potential in \n\nterms of oil and natural gas, these reserves have a considerable importance in each country\u2019s \n\neconomy and energy outlook. Moreover, since one of the barriers still faced is the high \n\noperational cost and the downside of drilling related events, by boosting directly or indirectly \n\nthe drilling activities, the possibility of having these fields coming through economically is \n\nenhanced. Thus, studies are still under performance in several related research areas in order to \n\nmodel a way to allow reliable forecast and drilling parameters choosiness for efficiency \n\nassurance while performing drilling operations.  \n \n\nIn this sense, this thesis is based in the analysis of the pre-salt carbonates operations focusing \n\nin operations that was carried in the South Atlantic Ocean. Considering the low oil prices and \n\nthe also Petrobras scandal in Brazil, it is fair to say that any improvements that may result in \n\ncost savings can help even more in making these pre-salt fields to come through.  \n\n \n\nThus, the originality of this research can be seen firstly by the pre-salt wells statistical study \n\npresented, from which an identity was drawn to refer numerically to these layers, allowing \n\nanalysis to be developed. Subsequently, the research novelty was presented by a new \n\nmethodology of ROP and SE models combination aiming drilling optimization. From the \n\ndetermination of operational time savings, of the best drill-bit to be used in these regions, of \n\ndrill-bit teeth-cutters wear rate, up to in-situ geothermal and pressure profiles, a ROP model \n\nwas modified accordingly, in order to reflect specifically the pre-salt wells. After the ROP \n\nmodel adjustments, it was combined with the SE formulations, yielding as a final result a path \n\nfor determining the best set of drilling mechanics parameters, aiming to support the industry \n\nfor an efficient and optimized operation, and so, potentializing costs reduction. \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\n5       CONCLUSION \n\nPre-salt basins and its exploration have become more and more frequently mentioned over the \n\nyears. Considered a very important petroleum-related source given the world energetic demand \n\nforecast scenario, seeking ways to support in making these fields effectively commercially \n\nviable has its value.  \n \n\nSupporting filling this gap, the exploration of the pre-salt reserves from related areas of the \n\nSouth Atlantic Ocean (in special the Brazilian and Angolan coast) has a very important role in \n\nthis context, since they can be considered twin pre-salt analog clusters. Seen as a considerably \n\nhigh operational cost to develop these fields, due to several facts disserted, this wells can cost \n\nup to 134,000,000.00 [USD]. Hence, to address performance and possible ways for improving \n\nthe efficiency of the pre-salt operation has been a route aiming support the refereed \n\nproblematics. \n \n\nWith the support of eight pre-salt wells and thirty eight run information, statistical analyses \n\nwere drawn from the gathered and filtered data, allowing the following conclusion in terms of \n\noperational performance: \n \n\n- From the total of thirty eight runs, almost half of them were drilled using a PDC drill-bit. \nFrom the other types, the hybrid showed to be appropriated as well, while the TCI and \n\ndiamond impregnated did not show to have good performance. The most frequent \n\nencountered problem in the drill-bits relates to broken and worn teeth-cutters. \n\n-  For some runs, the allowed drilling mechanics parameters choosiness window were going \n\nbeyond the down-hole tools limitations, what certainly influenced related BHA related \n\nfailure, consequently leading to operational down-time. \n\n- The operational performance showed to still allow improvements considering the non-\n\nproductive time and invisible-lost time analyzed. The following total minimum potential \n\noperational time savings was found: 37.1 [h] for well # A, 19.79 [h] for well # B, 48.8 [h] \n\nfor well # C, 8.15 [h] for well #D, 22.34 [h] for well # F and 105.94 [h] for well # H, \n\ntotalizing approximately 242 [h] (or 10 [days]), equivalent to 13,747,550.00 [USD]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\nConsidering the drillability improvements, much has been understood from the used models, \n\nallowing driving the following conclusions: \n \n\n- The Bourgoyne Jr. and Young Jr. ROP model is suitable for pre-salt formations, but some \n\nparameters adjustments were necessary to make it realistic for these carbonate formations. \n\nWith a starting point of model fitting with 36.52% as a relative error, this model showed to \n\ncorrelate most. The relative error dropped to 23.12% after the pre-salt adjustments. \n\n- The SE modeling shows to be more reliable than the ROP modeling in terms of simulation \n\nfitting. By comparing the field with the modeled data, the SE showed to have a relative \n\nerror lower the one calculated for the ROP, of 21.12%. \n\n- The reverse engineering methodology seems to be a very good way of re-building the drill-\n\nrate test curve for better visualization and drilling parameters boundaries determination. \n\n- Considering the pre-salt well # B used for the simulation as a case study, it was possible to \n\nverify that for sake of better analysis and clarification, filtering and data split may also \n\napply in research with similar purposes. \n \n\nThis thesis details a lot of step-by-step from data analysis up to final drilling mechanics \n\nparameters choosiness, allowing understanding where the room for a better performance in the \n\npre-salt operations are.  \n \n\nFor future work it may be interesting to address self- ROP/ SE models based on the pre-salt \n\ndrilling mechanics information presented, in special on the drilling fluid details and flowing \n\npatterns, considering that the whole data set used for developing the thesis had reliable fluid \n\nmechanics information making a practicable research. Also, given the delicate narrow pressure \n\nwindow available for managing the equivalent circulating density and the equivalent static \n\ndensity, it may be very interesting to implement the usage of the manage pressure drilling \n\nconcept for the pre-salt wells, what could have its applicability and well control assurance \n\nstudied, in a first step, in extensive research, and subsequently, its implementation tested in real \n\npre-salt related job. Another interesting thematic to be studied in a future work is the \n\ncombination of big data concept together with the needs of reliable and in real-time decision \n\nmaking tools in drilling activities. By having a robust data collection of these pre-salt wells \n\nbeing stored as one, from activities developed and under development in the African and \n\nBrazilian coast, a very robust data set for statistical analysis would be present, helping in on-\n\nline decision making. Still in this research line, the improvement of the real-time drill-rate tests \n\nis something very promising as a new well monitoring and analysis methodology, allowing the \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\noperational crew to have in its accustomed way a view of a new tool supporting drilling \n\noptimization and drilling efficiency enhancement. Considering these new ideas and their \n\nnovelty in the industry, attached to these future works, it would be possible to foresee the \n\ndeposit of new petroleum-related patents. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAFIFI, S.
