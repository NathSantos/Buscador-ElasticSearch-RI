Com esse foco, uma nova metodologia foi \nproposta para a cria\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo tecnol\u00f3gico. Este modelo pode ser interpretado \ncomo a consolida\u00e7\u00e3o dos diferentes modelos necess\u00e1rios para uma melhor \ncompreens\u00e3o das informa\u00e7\u00f5es geol\u00f3gicas e t\u00e9cnicas do dep\u00f3sito.

Com base \nna avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes cen\u00e1rios de perfura\u00e7\u00e3o e desmonte de rochas e de \nprodutividade do moinho, usando uma abordagem de mina-usina, foi poss\u00edvel obter \nganhos operacionais de curto prazo, tais como um aumento de 10,7% na taxa de \nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de usina e um aumento de 2,2% na taxa de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o da britagem com \npouco ou nenhum investimento de capital. Uma outra quest\u00e3o relevante para \nempresas de minera\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 o transporte de material. Um custo significativo na maioria \ndas minas surge da compra e manuten\u00e7\u00e3o de caminh\u00f5es de transporte. A britagem \nem cava e correias (IPCC em ingl\u00eas) vem sido avaliada em diversos casos devido ao \nseu potencial para reduzir os custos de transporte. Neste estudo, um modelo de \ntomada de decis\u00e3o foi criado para identificar em etapas iniciais de um projeto os \nbenef\u00edcios de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de IPCC semim\u00f3vel (SMIPCC em ingl\u00eas) em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com \nm\u00e9todo convencional, exclusivamente por caminh\u00f5es. O m\u00e9todo baseia-se na an\u00e1lise \nde custos e na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de impactos ambientais testado em uma mina a c\u00e9u aberto, \nonde os resultados indicaram que o SMIPCC foi a op\u00e7\u00e3o mais econ\u00f4mica para a \nopera\u00e7\u00e3o. Embora o investimento inicial do IPCC foi 60% maior do que a abordagem \nconvencional, o custo operacional do IPCC foi 43% menor, resultando em uma \nredu\u00e7\u00e3o de 28% do custo total a valor presente. \n  \n\nPalavras-Chave: Planejamento estrat\u00e9gico de mina.

The first is the \napplication of a Technological Model in a copper-gold mine and the second is a \ndecision making model to evaluate the benefit of semi-mobile in pit crusher and \nconveyor alternatives during the early stages of mining projects. In order to improve \nthe process and to maximize the production and/or value of a mining project, there \nneeds to be an integration of the geology, the mine plan, the processing and the \ngeometallurgy data. In order to accomplish this, a new methodology is proposed for \nthe creation of a technological model. This model can be interpreted as the \nconsolidation of the different models required for a better understanding of the \ngeological and technical information of the deposit. This concept was developed and \napplied at a copper and gold mine site located in Brazil. Based on the evaluation of \ndifferent blasting and mill productivity scenarios through a pit-to-plant approach, it was \npossible to obtain operational short-term gains such as a 10.7% increase in the plant \nproduction rate and a 2.2% increase in the crusher\u2019s feed rate with little or no capital \ninvestment. Another important issue faced by mining companies is related to material \nhandling. A significant cost in the operating budget of most mining operations arises \nfrom purchasing and maintaining haulage trucks. Recently, in-pit crushing and \nconveying (IPCC) has been subject to research because of its potential to reduce \nhaulage costs. A decision-making model was created to identify early on in a project \nwhether or not the semi-mobile IPCC (SMIPCC) is an appropriate alternative to the \nconventional truck haulage based on the loading and hauling approaches. The method \nis based on cost analysis and the evaluation of environmental impacts, being \nsuccessfully tested at an existing open-pit mine, where the results indicated that the \nIPCC was the most cost-effective option for the operation. Although the IPCC\u2019s initial \nCAPEX was 60% higher than the conventional approach, the IPCC\u2019s OPEX was 43% \nlower, resulting in a 28% reduction of the life-of-mine net present cost (NPC). \n\n  \nKey words: Strategic mine planning.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n  \nThe strategic mine plan is a crucial step for the success of mining companies \n\nand for its development it is necessary to use a number of inter-related variables that \n\nare usually estimated independently. These variables include operational data that is \n\ntraditionally isolated in information islands between the different departments in the \n\nmine or they are consolidated into individual models. This reduces the holistic view of \n\nthe deposit thereby causing a negative impact on the results of the strategic planning \n\nitself. In order to improve the process and to maximize the production and/or value of \n\na mining project, there needs to be an integration of the geology, the mine plan, the \n\nprocessing and the geometallurgy data.   \n\nAnother important issue faced by mining companies is related to material \n\nhandling. A significant cost in the operating budget of most mining operations arises \n\nfrom purchasing and maintaining haulage trucks. Recently, in-pit crushing and \n\nconveying (IPCC) has been subject to research because of its potential to reduce \n\nhaulage costs, however its is normally considered as an alternative during later stages \n\nof the project development, in feasibility studies. A tool to analyse it during early stages \n\nof a mining project can be very helpful as it has the potential to reduce an enormous \n\namount of engineering hours that in many cases is applied to the project that does not \n\nhave the propensity for semi-mobile IPCC application (SMIPCC).    \n\nThis study presents two innovative ways to evaluate mining projects. The first is \n\nthe development of a Technological Model applied to a copper-gold mining project. \n\nThis methodology integrates the geometallurgy and the mine-to-mill concept aimed to \n\noptimize mill productivity. The second is the creation and use of a decision-making \n\nmodel in the early stage of Front End Loading (FEL) studies of a Mining Project.   \n\nThe first innovative way to evaluate mining projects, the technological model \n\ncan be interpreted as the consolidation of the different models required for a better \n\nunderstanding of the geological and technical information of the deposit. This concept \n\nwas developed and applied at a copper and gold mine site located in Brazil together \n\nwith the consultant support of Metso. Based on the evaluation of different blasting and \n\nmill productivity scenarios through a pit-to-plant approach, it was possible to obtain \n\noperational short-term gains as the plant and crusher\u2019s feed rate increased. \n\n\n\n11  \n  \n\nThe second innovative way to evaluate mining projects, the decision-making \n\nmodel to evaluate the SMIPCC benefit is based on cost analysis and the evaluation of \n\nenvironmental impacts.

AN INTEGRATED PIT-TO-PLANT APPROACH USING TECHNOLOGICAL \nMODELS FOR STRATEGIC MINE PLANNING OF COPPER AND GOLD \nDEPOSITS  \n\n  \n\n \n2.1. INTRODUCTION  \n\n  \nThis research topic is part of an article to be published by the author in 20191. \n\nThe strategic planning of a mine is a crucial step for the success of mining companies, \n\nsince it provides the necessary information for the decision-making process concerning \n\nthe development of the deposit (SILVA, 2008). Therefore, in terms of strategic mine \n\nplanning, it is important that the uncertainty related to the orebody is properly \n\nquantified, assessed, and managed (GODOY, 2018). For the preparation of the \n\nstrategic mine plan, it is necessary to use models and data that are often estimated \n\nindependently.  \n\nThe technological model presented in this manuscript aims to solve the \n\ndisconnected and in many times, inaccurate view of the deposit. This new approach \n\nconsolidates the different data used to gain a better understanding of the geological, \n\nmine planning and processing data of the project. Lund and Lamberg (2014) state that \n\nthe construction of technological models can reduce operational risks and could help \n\nto optimize the production, taking into account sustainability and socio-economic \n\nfactors. \n\nThe data that is being referred to in this study includes the resource and \n\nstructural models, the geometallurgical model, the cost model and the operating \n\nSelective Mining Unit (SMU) model, which is the smallest volume of material that the \n\nclassification of ore and waste can be determined (SINCLAIR; BLACKWELL, 2002). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n______________________________ \n\n1 NUNES, R.; DE TOMI, G.; ALLAN, B.; BEZERRA E.; SILVA, R. (2019). An integrated pit-to-plant \napproach using technological models for strategic mine planning of copper and gold deposits.  \nREM \u2013 International Engineering Journal. Published in 2019-(2) April-June \n\n\n\n13  \n  \n\nThe Geometallurgical model, a component of the technological model, allows \n\nfor a better understanding of the ore characteristics. The importance of this increased \n\nknowledge base is that by knowing the strength, structure, and grade, there are \n\nadjustments that can be made to the crushing, grinding, and flotation processes (LA \n\nROSA et al., 2014). \n\nGomes et al. (2016) used a geometallurgical model to support an economic \n\nstudy considering reserve volumes, product quality and operational cost. From the \n\nmodel remarkable gains were obtained in the iron ore reserve and in the reduction of \n\nthe operation cost. Its use is also essential to strategic mining planning for mines that \n\nseek to optimize the use of mining resources over the life of mine (PHILANDER;  \n\nROZENDAAL, 2014). Navarra et al. (2018) incorporated the geometallurgical \n\nmodelling in long-term planning and confirmed its great impact on the life of mine.   \n\nAs noted by Augustin et al. (2017) the models should continually be updated \n\nwhenever possible, by way of additional exploratory drill holes, to ensure that a greater \n\ndetail of accuracy is achieved. Nadolski et al. (2015) complement that these models \n\nrequire constant adjustment, with the insertion of the geotechnical, geological, \n\nmetallurgical and other operational data from the plant, which will also serve to calibrate \n\npredictive models.    \n\nThe development process for the preparation of the technological model in \n\nquestion, used the work undertaken at a large-scale copper and gold open-pit mine of \n\nsulphide ore located in Brazil, as a reference. This work was carried out between the \n\nmine and the consultant expertise of Metso (2014). The process includes crushing, \n\ngrinding, and flotation. The saleable product is a copper-gold concentrate.  \n\nIn the studied mine, the ore comes from different mining faces feeding the plant \n\nat the same time. The technological model created tracked the ore characteristics back \n\nto its original mining face. One of the main objectives of the technological model was \n\nto determine the plant performance by the ore domain on an industrial scale and, to \n\nadjust the blasting parameters aiming to increase the plant throughput but keeping the \n\nmetallurgical recoveries at similar or higher levels. This concept of pit-to-plant \n\noptimization has been used at other mine sites around the world where different \n\nprocesses of integration and optimization were applied (JANKOVIC; VALERY, 2011).   \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n14  \n  \n\n2.2. METHODOLOGY  \n\n  \nAs a starting point for the model, the different unit operations of the mine and \n\nplant were characterized. Blasting designs, mine and plant sampling, and operational \n\ntesting were carried out. The data obtained was used to develop the specific models \n\nfor the prediction processes of blasting, crushing, and grinding. These models were \n\nthe basis of the construction of the technological model. Figure 1 summarizes the \n\ncomponents of the technological model.  \n\n \n                                             Figure 1 - Components of the Technological Model \n\n \n              Source: Prepared by the author \n \n\nThe methodology used for the preparation of the technological model is based \n\non the following steps: \n\n\u2022 Characterization and delineation of areas based on their geological structure, \n\nstrength, and correlation with their lithological and structural domains.   \n\n\u2022 Establishing operating restrictions such as the stability of benches, the presence of \n\nwater, SMU size, ore dilution allowance, the blast pile characteristics, the size of \n\nthe equipment, and the size/power of the crushers/mills, in addition to any other \n\nbottlenecks in the process. \n\n\u2022 Defining the main requirements of the subsequent steps to plan for each geological \n\ndomain in order to meet their specific requirements. \n\n\u2022 Use of software, mathematical models, and process simulation. \n\n\u2022Structural Geology/ Lithology/ Alterations \n\u2022Grades \n\u2022Geotechnical Parameters for mine design\n\nResource and Structural Model\n\n\u2022Metallurgical Recoveries\n\u2022Hardness\n\u2022Plant Productivity for different litho-structural domains\n\nGeometallurgical Model\n\n\u2022Operational cost estimates for the mine, plant, etc by litho-\nstructural domains\n\n\u2022Creation of SMUs based on planned mining and dilution methods\n\nCost Model and SMU\n\n\n\n15  \n  \n\n\u2022 Implementation and monitoring of the defined operational strategy (suitable plans \n\nfor each domain followed by the ideal adjustment for the crushing and grinding \n\ncycle). \n\n\u2022 Analysis and management of data and results. \n\n\u2022 Project implementation and maintaining the benefits obtained. \n\nThe above methodology is simplified in the Figure 2. \n\n \n                                                            Figure 2 - Project Flow Chart \n\n \n         Source: Modified from PIO (Mine to Mill) \u2013 Metso, 2014 \n\n \n\n The first step required an audit to be carried out during the drilling and blasting \n\noperations. This was necessary in order to obtain data, pictures, and other \n\nobservations that are required to provide enough information for the creation of the \n\nfragmentation models. Once the information is obtained, the blasting techniques can \n\nbe tailored to the rock characteristics, which will allow for substantial improvements in \n\nthe downstream operations (KANCHIBOLTA et al., 2015). \n\nSimulations of the blasting plan were executed with both the soft and hard ore. \n\nVarious parameters were changed depending on the simulation. Compared to the base \n\ncase these variations included, a slight increase in bench height, an increase in hole \n\ndiameter, a change in spacing, sub drilling, hole depth, stemming, and an increase in \n\nthe column charge. \n\nIn the second phase of the preparation of the technological model, laboratory \n\ntests, image analyses, data processing, and mathematical models were consolidated. \n\nIn order to optimize the ROM fragmentation from the mine blasting, a fragmentation \n\nmodel was developed. This model is sensitive to the main parameters that affect the \n\nblasting performance. The fragmentation model was then calibrated with the data \n\n\n\n16  \n  \n\nobtained from the observed blasting during the audit process and used to predict \n\nchanges in the particle size distribution of the ROM. \n\n \n2.2.1. Fragmentation Measurement Using Image Analysis \n\n                              \n\nParticle size distribution of the ROM is one of the parameters used in calibrating \n\nthe fragmentation model. Prior studies of operations around the world have indicated \n\nthat image analysis is a good and practical method for this purpose. Photographs of \n\nthe piles formed after the verified blasting and primary crushing were processed using \n\nthe Split-Desktop software (SPLIT ENGINEERING, 2017). Each image contains an \n\nobject for scale. For this project, two Styrofoam balls were used and are pictured in \n\nFigure 3.    \n\n \n                              Figure 3 - Example of a rendered image from the Split-Desktop software. \n\n        \n         Source: PIO (Mine to Mill) \u2013 Metso, 2014 \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Blast Tracking \n \n\nElectronic tags were used to track the blasted material, enabling the verification \n\nof when the material enters the crushing/grinding cycle. Therefore, the complete \n\nsampling of the plant could be performed using the audited blasted material. Samples \n\ncollected from the conveyor belts and the main streams for laboratory tests determined \n\nthe breaking characteristics of the material. Specific models were developed for the \n\nblasting, crushing, grinding, and classification processes by using the audited blast \n\ndata, sampling, and testing. Figure 4 shows the electronic tag with a diameter of 60mm \n\nand a height of 30mm used in the study as well as the typical installation of the \n\nelectronic tag system with an antenna positioned above the conveyor belt. \n\n\n\n17  \n  \n\n \n                     Figure 4 - The Reinforced Electronic Tag and the antenna above the conveyor belt \n\n    \n       Source: PIO (Mine to Mill) \u2013 Metso, 2014 \n\n \n\n  In total 274 electronic tags were used in the survey data. They were put in the \n\nstem, in the piles formed after detonation, and in the feed of each primary crusher. In \n\norder to obtain the data for calibrating the mathematical models for the different \n\nequipment in the circuit, sampling was performed in the crushing and grinding circuit. \n\nOperational data was also collected during the sampling to determine the production \n\nrates and power consumption of each piece of equipment listed in Table 1. The \n\nsampling points are shown in the flowchart in Figure 5. Once the sampling was \n\ncomplete, the data was balanced and modelling was performed in the JKSimMet \n\nsoftware (JKTECH, 2014). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18  \n  \n\n                                            Table 1 - List of the comminution equipment\u2019s circuit \nEquipment Description \n\nPrimary \n\nCrushers \n\n\u2022MMD Sizer S100-20, 400kW \n\n\u2022Metso C160, 220kW \n\nSAG Mill \n1 mill with an internal diameter of 10.01m and 4.95m of EGL, \n\n11000 kW, 10.34rpm \n\nPebble Crusher 2 Metso HP800, 600kW \n\nBall Mill \n1 mill with an internal diameter of 7.09m and 11.94m of EGL, \n\n12500 kW, 12.19rpm \n\nCyclones \n\n\u2022Cluster SAG: 6 Multotec HC900-L20 cyclones, with a \n\n360mm equivalent entry diameter, a 340mm vortex, and a \n\n170mm apex \n\n\u2022Cluster Ball: 8 Krebs GMAX 33 cyclones, with a 390mm  \n\nequivalent entry diameter, a 305mm vortex, and a 180 mm \n\napex \n      Source: Yamana Gold Inc \n \n\n   Figure 5 - Sampling points in the grinding cycle \n\n \n        Source: Yamana Gold Inc \n\n \n\n\n\n19  \n  \n\nAfter the completion of the mass balancing, the mathematical models of all the \n\nprocessing units were calibrated according to the Anderson and Awachie model for the \n\nprimary crushers in the JKSimMet software version 6.0 (JKTECH, 2014) and Whiten \n\n(Whiten and White, 1979).

The cyclones were adjusted using Nageswararao\u2019s \n\nmodel (NAGESWARARAO, 1995). \n\nUsing the balanced flow data, that includes the mass flow rate, the percentage \n\nof dry solids, and the particle size distribution, the models could be adjusted with \n\nrespect to the parameters of each specific operation. Other information taken into \n\naccount were the characteristics of the ore, the dimensions of the equipment, and the \n\ninformation related to the operation during sampling, which includes the load and \n\nspeed levels of the mills, the energy consumption, and the operating pressure of the \n\ncyclones. Historical data was also considered to ensure that the results are consistent \n\nand that they represent the operation of the cycle as accurately as possible. \n\n \n \n\n2.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n\n                             \nIn total there were 24 blasting simulations carried out.

Once the simulations were complete, one of the \n\nthirteen (base case) was selected to be applied to the blasting plan in the field.

There was a 37% reduction in \n\nthe production rate of the SAG (2026 to 1269 t/h) when the circuit supply consisted \n\nonly of hard material. Under this same condition, increasing the powder factor to 2.78 \n\nkg/m3 resulted in an increase in the mill\u2019s productivity by 10.7%. This result directly \n\n\n\n23  \n  \n\nrelates to the finer particle size distribution obtained from the increased energy in the \n\nrocks from the blasting.  \n\nThe SAG cycle improves with an increase in the load (the percent of mill volume \n\noccupied by media plus voids) from 8% mill balls (measured after grinding) to 10-13% \n\nmill balls. These changes allowed the grinding circuit to increase to within 2-4% of the \n\nproductivity achieved with the largest open area. In order to better utilize the installed \n\npower of the pebble crushers, SAG mill grates with larger openings were installed. \n\nWhen comparing the scenario to the finer ROM, the simulation resulted in a 14% \n\nincrease in pebble generation, while the feed rate increased by 2.2%. It is important to \n\nnote that by increasing the opening of the grate, the grate life is shortened. Therefore, \n\nit was suggested to find alternatives in order to minimize the wear on the grate.  \n\n An outcome of this methodology, the technological model, has shown to be \n\nadherent to the plant results and operational data collected after many reconciliation \n\nprocesses. This methodology is still in use at the mine, which constantly updates the \n\nmodel with the new input data.   \n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\n \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n24  \n  \n\n3. A DECISION MAKING-METHOD TO ASSESS THE BENEFITS OF A SEMI-\nMOBILE IN-PIT CRUSHING AND CONVEYING ALTERNATIVE DURING THE \nEARLY STAGES OF A MINING PROJECT  \n\n  \n  \n\n3.1. INTRODUCTION \n\n  \nThis research topic is part of an article to be published by the author in 20192. \n\nOne of the challenges while evaluating the early stages of open pit mining projects is \n\nto determine which of the alternatives for material transportation and which location for \n\nthe primary crusher should be considered for further detailed studies and scenario \n\nselection. A parallel study between the alternative of the conventional truck haulage \n\nwith the primary crusher located outside of the pit and the in-pit crushing and conveying \n\nalternative can be a long, expensive process. Mining companies with portfolios that \n\ncontain many open pit projects usually face issues in evaluating the benefits of an IPCC \n\nimplementation due to the massive workload and time necessary for completion. \n\nProperly evaluating these alternatives is important since the haulage costs in open pit \n\nmines can be 60% or more of the mine\u2019s operating cost (RIBEIRO, 2013). IPCC \n\nsystems are now receiving more attention due to the rising cost of the truck haulage \n\ncycles, which can be attributed to the cost of diesel and spare parts, leading to the \n\nIPCC being the favourable option. In contrast, the IPCC is considered a low-cost \n\nalternative in terms of operating costs due to its continuous operation regime, reduced \n\nlabour, and lower energy consumption, but it requires a high capital cost, and has \n\nreduced flexibility (LONDO\u00d1O et al. 2014).       \n\nThere have been studies carried out in the past proposing the use of SMIPCC \n\nsystems as an alternative to conventional trucking and regular IPCC systems, where \n\nthe crusher is fully mobile and only a conveyor is used for haulage.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n______________________________ \n\n2 NUNES, R.; DELBONI JR, H.; DE TOMI, G.; INFANTE, C. B.; ALLAN, B. (2019). A decision-making \nmethod to assess the benefits of a semi-mobile in-pit crushing and conveying alternative during \nthe early stages of a mining project.  REM \u2013 International Engineering Journal. Published in 2019-(2) \nApril-June.  \n\n\n\n25  \n  \n\nA SMIPCC can exploit the advantages of both systems, conventional trucking \n\nand fully mobile IPCC, but it is important to ensure that the in-pit crusher is at an \n\nappropriate distance from the work front and that its location will be suitable for at least \n\none year of operation before it needs to be moved (RAHMANPOUR et al. 2014). \n\nSMIPCC systems are considered flexible and adaptable because of the continuous \n\nuse of trucks and being able to install a crusher in a suitable location (NEHRING et al. \n\n2018). The majority of studies that compare IPCC with truck based haulage systems \n\nusing conveyors, result in large operational savings due to a more efficient energy and \n\ncapital allocation.  \n\nAlthough the IPCC concept is not new, as it was introduced in the 1950\u2019s in \n\nGermany (RITTER et al. 2014), companies are still concerned with the implementation \n\nof such an alternative due to the high risk involved. Another issue is that it is not as \n\nsimple as choosing a particular haulage system; one also needs to know how to adapt \n\nit to the mine plan to ensure a reduction in the overall mining costs. Therefore, the \n\nuniqueness of a project poses a contractual constraint, as no pre-made off-the-shelf \n\noptions are available (DEAN et al. 2015).     \n\nFurthermore, from environmental licensing process standpoint, the method \n\nused for decision-making can be a relevant tool to be used before going through the \n\npreliminary environmental licensing process, so that the SMIPCC alternative can be \n\nconsidered to demonstrate a reduction in environmental impact.   \n\nTo get a better understanding of the IPCC alternative, a new method is proposed \n\nthat aims to estimate the technical, economic, and environmental benefits of the semi-\n\nmobile IPCC alternative from an early project stage. The proposed approach has been \n\ntested using data from the initial design studies (PMI, 2013) of an open-pit copper-gold \n\nmine located in Brazil.     \n\n \n \n\n3.2. METHODOLOGY  \n\n  \nThe method was designed as a model that uses the data available from the early \n\nstages of the evaluation of mining projects, usually from the scoping studies, as its \n\ninput parameters. The model analyses both the conventional trucking and the SMIPCC \n\nscenarios. In order to properly estimate the truck requirements, production capacities, \n\n\n\n26  \n  \n\nand costs, the following should be calculated: truck payload, engine powering and \n\npropulsion, cycle time estimations, and production rates (HUSTRULID et al. 2013). \n\nThe input can be classified into the following groups:  \n\n\u2022 Material: the material itself, in situ density, and swell factor; \n\n\u2022 Truck Size: to be chosen from a payload of either 100, 150, 200, or 250 short \n\ntonnes; \n\n\u2022 Operating: average haulage distance (flat, uphill, and downhill), rolling resistance, \n\ngrade, speed limit, typical fixed times for spotting, dumping, and waiting, primary \n\ncrushing P80 and design safety factor, working hours, hourly efficiency, conveyor\u2019s \n\naverage speed, length, and elevation; \n\n\u2022 Production: throughput, and life-of-mine; \n\n\u2022 Economic: operating costs, discount rate, and exchange rate (if applicable). \n\nThe input models considered for the evaluation of the conventional trucking and \n\nthe SMIPCC scenarios remain unchanged, with the exception of:    \n\n\u2022 Operating: Haulage distance (flat, uphill, and downhill) considering the location of \n\nthe semi-mobile in-pit crusher, the conveyor average speed, length, and elevation; \n\n\u2022  Economic: capital and operating costs, considering the capital and operating costs \n\nresulting from the implementation of the conveyor, reduction of the haulage fleet, \n\nand relocation of the semi-mobile in-pit crusher. \n\nIt is important to highlight the three assumptions used in this model:   \n\n(1) The mine\u2019s throughput and, consequently, the life of mine for the conventional and \n\nSMIPCC scenarios remain the same, given that only the haulage fleet and the \n\nconveyor\u2019s input must be changed from one scenario to the other; \n\n(2) The truck payload (referred to below as the truck size) is an input parameter instead \n\nof a calculated one and is then used to select the loading equipment. This method \n\nis the reverse of the conventional fleet selection method. The payload relates to \n\nknown off-road truck models that cover most mine operation cases; \n\n(3) Since both alternatives use the same number of excavators, the excavator CAPEX \n\nand OPEX were not included in the economic analysis and calculations because \n\ntheir costs will be equal. \n\n \n\n\n\n27  \n  \n\nThe model continues the analysis as follows: \n\n(1) Truck and auxiliary equipment fleet dimensioning;  \n\n(2) Conveyor dimensioning;  \n\n(3) Economic Analysis; \n\n(4) Environmental Impact Analysis. \n\n \n\nThe method proposed in the article aims to be a tool to help in deciding on the \n\nbest type of transport alternative to be used. It includes important topics such as the \n\ntransportation scenario for the open pit mine, a comparison between the conventional \n\nmodel and the SMIPCC, and the economic feasibility and sustainability of each \n\nscenario. \n\n The truck fleet size is determined by evaluating the model that is based on the \n\nmine\u2019s production capacity and operating parameters, specifically, the average \n\nhaulage distance (AHD). These two factors are very important as they hold great \n\nweight in the decision to use the IPCC system (NEHRING et al. 2018). By selecting \n\nthe truck size (model) from one of the four options, the number of trucks is calculated, \n\nas well as the number of bulldozers and motor graders required (Figure 7). It is worth \n\nmentioning that, because the transportation model considered in this study is a \n\nSMIPCC, it is still necessary to use trucks to move the material from the mining face \n\nto the in-pit crusher, where it will then be crushed and loaded onto the conveyors \n\n(MCCARTHY, 2011; MOHAMMADI et al. 2011).   \n\nTherefore, only the AHD from the mining face to the in-pit crusher is considered \n\nin the SMIPCC sizing, whereas the entire route is considered for the conventional \n\nmodel. In Figure 7, the AHD node indicated by [1] is subject to change based on the \n\nmaterial transport alternative selected. The output nodes, indicated by [2], can be \n\ndetermined by using a rule of thumb based on the required truck units of one bulldozer \n\nfor every 20 trucks and one motor grader for every 15 trucks, with a minimum of one \n\nunit in both cases. \n\n \n\n\n\n28  \n  \n\n                                                         Figure 7 - Fleet Sizing Flowchart \n\n              \n  Source: Prepared by the author \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Conveyor Sizing Flowchart \n\n         \n\n         Source: Prepared by the author \n\n \n\nThe conveyor\u2019s characteristics, such as the width, the power of the required \n\nmotor, and the data to calculate the SMIPCC installation costs, are selected based on \n\nthe material characteristics and operating parameters, such as the P80 for the primary \n\ncrusher, and the mine production data (OSMETTI et al., 2012; BERTINSHAW et al., \n\n2012) (Figure 8). Also in Figure 8, refer to Osmetti et al. (2012), and Bertinshaw et al. \n\n\n\n29  \n  \n\n(2012), for three of the input parameter nodes, [3], in order to determine the conveyor \n\ndimensioning.    \n\nThe economic analysis of the mine for the two alternatives is performed \n\nconsidering these inputs. All the costs are included in this analysis and are separated \n\ninto capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) throughout the \n\nlife of the mine (LOM). The costs are brought to the present value based on the \n\ndiscount rate(s) selected, resulting in the present value of the cost (NPC) (Figure 9). \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - Economic Analysis Flowchart \n\n \n\nSource: Prepared by the author \n\n \n\n   Using the discount rate when evaluating mining projects serves the same \n\npurpose as it does when evaluating projects in other fields: it considers the time value \n\nof money and the project risk (ATAEE-POUR et al., 2009). Since each project involves \n\na different set of risks, the discount rates analysed in each one will be different. Product \n\nstandards for nodes [4] are used for the input parameters. These standards were based \n\non the truck cost, freight cost, and the import tax associated to it. In addition to the \n\ndiscount rate and the LOM, the total OPEX for the conveyor [5] also considers \n\nrelocating the in-pit crusher and the cost of the conveyor\u2019s electricity consumption. \n\n\n\n30  \n  \n\n  The model also proposes comparison of each scenario\u2019s environmental \n\nanalysis on gas emissions. Based on the previously sized fleet, the amount of \n\nequipment and the type of engine is assessed and the tonnage of gases emitted during \n\nthe LOM is calculated based on the EPA`s Tier 4 Standard (US EPA 2004). The gases \n\nbeing analysed are the following: carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane hydrocarbons, \n\n(NMHC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) (Figure 10). \n\n \n\n                                                   Figure 10 - Environmental Analysis Flowchart \n\n            \n\n            Source: Prepared by the author \n\n \n \n\n3.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n\n  \n\nData from a Brazilian copper-gold mine was used for for this analysis. This study \n\nwas implemented for a conceptual study based on the Project Management Body of \n\nKnowledge (PMI 2013). This decision-making process can be applied to any open pit \n\nmining project, as long as the specifications for each project are incorporated.    \n\nThe life of mine was set as 20 years with an annual production of 16 million tons \n\nusing 150-short ton trucks (Table 5). The AHD for the two alternatives was 1.6km. In \n\nthe case of the SMIPCC scenario, the trucks travel 0.5km from the mining face to the \n\nin-pit crusher (IPC), and then for the next 1.1km, the material is transported by the \n\n\n\n31  \n  \n\nconveyor to the transfer chute. In the conventional scenario, the trucks travel the entire \n\n1.6km along the ramp that closely follows the conveyor\u2019s profile, to a crusher that would \n\nbe located near the indicated transfer chute in Figure 11.   \n\n \n                                                        Table 5 - Production Parameters \nTruck size  [short tons] 150 \n\nLOM [years] 20 \n\nEstimated Throughput [Mt] 16 \n\nMaterial  \n \n\nCopper ores, crushed \nSource: Rodrigo Augusto Nunes \n\n \n                                       Figure 11 - Location of the SMIPCC alternative \n\n    \n       Source: Google Earth  \n \n\nThe inputs considered the decision-making model were created using Excel and \n\nVBA Macro and are summarized in the table below (Table 6).

A noticeable \n\ndifference in the initial CAPEX (before year 3) is that the SMIPCC installation is \n\napproximately 60% higher than the conventional scenario. This is due to the high \n\ninstallation cost of the crusher and conveyor belt.   \n\nHowever, the sustaining CAPEX (after year 3) for the conventional alternative is \n\nmore than two times greater than that of the SMIPCC, due to the need for fleet \n\nreplacement. Furthermore, when considering the OPEX, for the conventional case \n\nwithout including the discount rate, it is about 43% greater than that of the SMIPCC \n\nbecause of high maintenance costs, tires, fuel, and labour.   \n\n \n                                                           Table 8 - Economic Results \n\nThousands Conventional SMIPCC \nInitial CAPEX - Before Year 3 [US$] $28,893 $46,966 \nSustaining CAPEX - After Year 3 [US$] $43,244 $18,534 \nOPEX [US$] $190,313 $107,959 \nNPC @ 5% discounted rate [US$] $174,619 $126,230 \n\nSource: Prepared by the author \n\n \n\nThe net present cost (NPC) is an important factor for a project. In this study, five \n\ndifferent discount rates were taken into account, which expanded the possible number \n\nof scenarios. The considered discount rates were 0.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, and 10.0%. \n\nThe values obtained from using a discount rate of 5% are presented above (Table 8). \n\nIt shows that the NPC for the conventional alternative is about 50 million dollars more \n\nexpensive than using the semi-mobile IPCC. When considering the total cost per ton \n\n(CAPEX &amp; OPEX), the SMIPCC has a value almost 34% lower than that of the \n\nconventional alternative (Table 9).    \n \n                                                              Table 9 - Cost per ton Summary \n\n   \nConventional SMIPCC \n\nCAPEX&amp;OPEX [US$/t] $0.82 $0.54 \nCAPEX  [US$/t] $0.23 $0.20 \nOPEX [US$/t] $0.59 $0.34 \n\n  Source: Prepared by the author \n\n \n\n\n\n34  \n  \n\nThe results of the environmental analysis were also very insightful. During the \n\nLOM, when opting for only using trucks, the carbon monoxide emissions are more than \n\ndouble that of the SMIPCC alternative (Table 10). The additional emissions are due to \n\nthe high number of trucks required for the conventional trucking compared to the \n\nSMIPCC. For the examined mine, eight trucks are needed for the strictly trucking \n\nalternative, whereas when using the SMIPCC, only three trucks are needed. Therefore, \n\nthe results also corroborate that the IPCC alternatives are also a means of reducing \n\ncarbon emissions (MCCARTHY, 2011; COOPER; TURNBULL, 2009).     \n\n \n                                                         Table 10 - Environmental Analysis \n\n   \nConventional SMIPCC \n\nCO - Carbon Monoxide  [t] 3,586 1,516 \n\nNMHC \u2013 Non-methane Hydrocarbons  [t] 195 82 \n\nNOx - Nitrogen Oxides [t] 3,344 1,274 \nPM - Particulate Matter [t] 39 16 \n\n    Source: Prepared by the author \n\n \n\n3.3.1. Discussion \n \n\nThe expected result of the decision-making method presented was to conclude \n\non which alternative should be selected while considering the proposed parameters, \n\nthe OPEX, the CAPEX, the NPC, and the environmental analysis. Achieving this result \n\nwas successful. The evaluation method allowed for a broader view of the importance \n\nof such variables in the decision-making process. In the discussed case, the SMIPCC \n\nalternative resulted in a lower sustaining CAPEX and OPEX, as well as a lower cost \n\nper tonne compared to the conventional alternative. There were also environmental \n\nbenefits from using the SMIPCC system: the amount of carbon monoxide, non-\n\nmethane hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and other particulate matter was reduced.  \n\n   The economic, operational, and production data of the initial study were \n\ncompared for both transportation systems (conventional and SMIPCC), which exposed \n\nthe pros and cons of each one and allowed the company to improve data interpretation \n\nso they could make an informed decision on whether or not to continue to the next \n\nproject phase. In the case of the studied mine, the SMIPCC was the more viable \n\n\n\n35  \n  \n\nmethod considering the net present value and the lower costs and gas emissions. Even \n\nthough the production is not extremely high, nor is the AHD very long, there was still a \n\nnoticeable difference in costs.  \n\n \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS   \n  \n\nWith the increased challenge and complexity of mines, it is imperative to evolve the \n\nway that projects are being done. The two methodologies presented have shown the \n\nvalue. \n\nIn relation to the objective 1, the technological model has proved to be a viable \n\noption for the case evaluated and it has the potential to be applied to different projects \n\nwith similar grinding processes. For the studied mine, the technological model was \n\nincorporated into the short and medium term mine-planning schedules. It was \n\nformulated as a block model and was used together with the mine planning software.  \n\n  The different technological variables presented in the model enabled the \n\nengineers to simulate different blasting and plant productivity scenarios, supporting the \n\ndecision making process for the development of the deposit. As a result, it was possible \n\nto improve of the plant with little or no capital investment by optimizing the breaking \n\nand fragmenting mechanisms through blasting, crushing, and grinding. This resulted \n\nin:  \n\n \n\n\u2022 A reduction of the top size of the ROM, which allowed the primary crusher to \n\noperate with a higher feed rate by 2.2%, a reduced opening, and to feed the SAG \n\nwith a smaller top size.  \n\n\u2022 Operating the SAG with more fines (<10mm) by increasing the powder factor to \n\n2.78kg/m3, increased the plant production rate by 10.7% while using the same \n\npower. \n\n \n\nIn relation to the objective 2, the decision-making method presented to evaluate the \n\nSMIPCC alternative is meant to be used for a conceptual study level. By using the \n\nproposed decision-making method, it is possible to identify the projects that have the \n\npotential for SMIPCC implementation without necessarily spending a large amount of \n\ntime, which can be expensive and wasteful. Therefore, it enables mining companies to \n\n\n\n36  \n  \n\nshift their focus to the alternatives that continue to show potential for further in depth \n\nstudies. In general, IPCC installation is an attractive option due to its lower sustaining \n\nCAPEX and OPEX. After evaluating the decision-making model for the specific case \n\ntreated, the sustaining CAPEX is approximately halved, and the OPEX is 34% lower.  \n\n   However, due to the high initial cost of installing the SMIPCC, which in this case \n\nis seen to be 60% higher, installation is only feasible when there is a long mine life. In \n\naddition, if the mine has a small AHD and/or low production, the IPCC is not very \n\nappealing because the initial CAPEX may not be paid back during the LOM. In this \n\nparticular case, the haulage distance and mine life are sufficient to notice a 0.28$/t \n\ndecrease in total expenditure. Savings are not solely restricted to the costs; there are \n\nalso noticeable environment benefits.   \n\n  For the discussed case, carbon monoxide emissions drop 58% when using the \n\nSMIPCC scenario. Later, the mine moved to a feasibility study and detailed design \n\nphases and the SMIPCC is now installed and in operation at the site.     \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n37  \n  \n\nREFERENCES \n  \n \nATAEE-POUR, M., IRANNAJAD, M., TAHERI, M.
