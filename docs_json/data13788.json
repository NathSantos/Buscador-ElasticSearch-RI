INTRODUCTION\n\nPrevious works in central Ribeira Fold Belt (RFB)\nestablished age constraints for the Brasiliano orogeny\nand tectonic evolution of the belt (e.g.: CORDANI et al.,\n1973; MACHADO et al., 1996; SCHMITT et al., 2004;\n2008; HEILBRON &amp; MACHADO, 2003; BENTO DOS\nSANTOS et al., 2007; FONSECA et al., 2008). However,\nthere are few thermochronological studies (BENTO DOS\nSANTOS et al., 2008; FONSECA et al., 2008; SCHMITT et\nal., 2004) that accurately depict the geodynamic evolu-\ntion and quantitatively constrain the cooling rates of\ncentral RFB. \n\nThis work provides new petrological cooling rates,\nwhich can be determined from analysis of diffusional\n\nzoning in metamorphic minerals (SPEAR &amp; PARRISH,\n1996). Here, petrological cooling rates based on Fe-Mg\ndiffusion between garnet and biotite inclusions for the\nstudied granulites and migmatites are presented. The\nobtained results are then compared with geochronologi-\ncal cooling rates previously obtained in the study area\n(BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2008). \n\nSeveral authors tried to use mineral diffusion mecha-\nnisms in order to determine cooling rates (e.g.: DODSON,\n1973; LASAGA et al., 1977; EHLERS et al., 1994; SPEAR\n&amp; PARRISH, 1996). These authors assumed that diffusion\ninduced by compositional variation in the garnet-biotite\ninterface is a function of Kd(Mg/Fe)\n\nGarnet-Biotite in\nresponse to thermal changes, such as cooling during the\nretrograde path. During cooling garnet is enriched in\n\n\n\n84 T. M. BENTO DOS SANTOS; J. M. MUNH\u00c1; C. C. G. TASSINARI &amp; P. E. FONSECA\n\nFe/(Fe+Mg), whereas biotite inclusions become poorer.\nWhen temperature drops below closure temperature,\ndiffusion becomes negligible. The diffusive process is\nlimited by the rate of diffusion in garnet, because\nDFe/Mg\n\nBiotite >> DFe/Mg\nGarnet and mass balance deter-\n\nmines that diffusive flows (rate of cation transfer in the\nmineral interface) between garnet and biotite must be the\nsame. Therefore, Fe/(Fe+Mg) variations will be a func-\ntion of biotite inclusion size or garnet/biotite proportion.\nThis implies that Fe/(Fe+Mg) results in garnet and biotite\ninclusions can be transformed in its respective apparent\nclosure temperature and cooling rates can be obtained\n(Fig. 1). The used methodologies only consider diffusion\nbetween garnet and respective biotite inclusions and\nexclude garnet \u2013 matrix biotite interface diffusive proces-\n\nses, because it is very likely that the latter had open-system\nbehaviour. Besides, most matrix biotite is affected or was\nformed by net-transfer reactions that include consump-\ntion of garnet rims. Therefore, it is unreasonable to use\ngarnet and matrix biotites to model cation diffusion\nbased petrological cooling rates. \n\nThis work explores the referred assumptions that\nallow petrological cooling rates to be applied to natural\nsystems, as well as the potential pitfalls regarding these\nmethodologies, namely the difficulty in assuring that\nopen-system behaviour did not take place in complex\norogenic belts, such as the RFB. Therefore, this article is\na critic work to the applied methodologies and also a first\nattempt to constrain petrological cooling rates in the\nRFB. \n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Schematics showing how composition of biotite inclusions are dependent of respective size and how their Fe/Mg composition can be transformed\nin petrological cooling rates using the SPEAR &amp; PARRISH (1996) methodology. Garnet\u2019s core composition is used with the FERRY &amp; SPEAR (1978)\nthermometer in order to obtain apparent closure temperatures. CHAKRABORTY &amp; GANGULLY (1992) \u2013 C&amp;G (1992) \u2013 diffusion coefficients are used\nto depict the petrological cooling rates. In this example, cooling rates range from 1 \u2013 1000\u00baC/Ma (modified from SPEAR &amp; PARRISH, 1996).\n\n\n\nAssumptions and problems with Fe-Mg garnet \u2013 biotite diffusion based petrological cooling rates 85\n\n2. GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND FIELD\nOBSERVATIONS \n\nThe RFB extends over 1,500 km along the SE\nBrazilian coast from southern Bahia State to Uruguay,\nthrough Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais,\nS\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 States (CORDANI, 1971). The RFB\nis a NE-SW trending (south and central sectors) and\nNNE-SSW trending (northern sector) Neoproterozoic\nmobile belt (CORDANI et al., 1973) formed during the\nBrasiliano Orogeny as outcome of the collision between\nthe S\u00e3o Francisco and West Congo cratons, from which\nresulted Western Gondwana at around 670 \u2013 480 Ma ago\n(TROUW et. al., 2000; SCHMITT et al., 2008) (Fig. 2a). \n\nThe RFB constitutes a very complex orogenic zone\ncomposed of several geological units, commonly sepa-\nrated by deep dextral shears, being the studied S\u00e3o\nFidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua (SFSAP) sector located\ninside the Al\u00e9m Para\u00edba \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua Shear\n(APPS) system (Fig. 2b). This megashear system\ndeformed the area rocks imposing a NE trending trans-\npressive shear deformation (FONSECA et al., 2008) asso-\nciated with long-term HT/LP metamorphism (BENTO\nDOS SANTOS et al., 2008). \n\nAccording to TROUW et al. (2000), the RFB can be\ndivided in four major lithologic associations: a) reworked\nArchean to Paleoproterozoic basement rocks composed\nof metavolcanic-sedimentary sequences, granodioritic\northogneisses and intermediate granulites; b) a deformed\nmeta-sedimentary sequence composed of pelitic schists\nand high grade migmatitic paragneisses with quartzite,\ncalc-silicate and amphibolite intercalations; c) molasic\nsedimentary basins; and d) widespread granitoid intru-\nsive bodies with different tectonic settings, from pre- to\npost-collision stages of the Brasiliano orogenic system\n(CAMPOS NETO &amp; FIGUEIREDO, 1995; TROUW et. al.,\n2000; PEDROSA SOARES &amp; WIEDMANN-LEONARDOS,\n2000). \n\nHEILBRON &amp; MACHADO (2003) and VALLADARES et\nal. (2008) divided the central RFB into four tecto-\nnic/lithologic/geochronological domains as klippen\nthrusted against the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton. According to\nthese authors, the central sector of RFB includes from\nNW to SE: a) the Occidental Domain, a pre-1.8 Ga\npassive margin succession, considered to be the reworked\nmargin of the S\u00e3o Francisco Craton (basement rocks);\nb) the Para\u00edba do Sul klippe, composed of amphibolite\nfacies orthogneisses and meta-sediments; c) the Oriental\n\nFig. 2  \u2013 a) Central Ribeira Fold Belt (square) in the Western Gondwana amalgamation context (modified from TROUW et al., 2000).

BENTO DOS SANTOS; J. M. MUNH\u00c1; C. C. G. TASSINARI &amp; P. E. FONSECA\n\nDomain, comprising the Rio Negro Magmatic arc\n(TUPINAMB\u00c1, 1999) and fore-arc and back-arc meta-\n-sedimentary sequences; and d) the Cabo Frio Terrane\n(SCHMITT et al., 2008), an allochthonous terrane belon-\nging to the West Congo Craton. \n\nRegarding the RFB tectonic evolution, a dominant\nensialic evolution with important crustal reworking has\nbeen favoured (CORDANI et al., 1973), although subordi-\nnated oceanic crust subduction (and obduction) and con-\ntinental accretion have also been considered (PEDROSA\nSOARES &amp; WIEDMANN-LEONARDOS, 2000; PEDROSA\nSOARES et al., 2001). Within the central part of the belt,\nin the Rio de Janeiro state, HEILBRON et al. (1993) and\nMACHADO et al. (1996) proposed that the tectonometa-\nmorphic evolution of the Brasiliano Orogeny should be\ndivided in: a) collision period (590 \u2013 563 Ma) in which\noccurred the main deformation phases and meta-\nmorphism, with reworking and partial melting of older\ncontinental basement rocks and emplacement of several\ngranitoid bodies; b) post-collision period at 535 \u2013 520 Ma,\ncorresponding to major dextral shear zones and retro-\ngrade metamorphism; c) post-tectonic period of orogenic\ncollapse with emplacement of late granitic plutons at 490\nMa ago (BENTO DOS SANTOS et al., 2007). \n\nThe studied area, the SFSAP sector, is located in the\ncentral-north part of the RFB in northern Rio de Janeiro\nState (SE Brazil) and SE to the APPS main shear (near\nSanto Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua) (Fig. 2 and 3). The SFSAP\nsector underwent complex polyphase ductile deforma-\ntion, with thrusting dominantly to ESE, followed by\nNNE-SSW sub-horizontal dextral shearing that produced\nthe elongated mineral fabric observed in the studied\nrocks (BASCOU et al., 2002; FONSECA et al., 2008). In the\nstudied area three main deformation phases can be\nobserved. As outlined by FONSECA et al. (2008), the\nearliest deformation event (D1) corresponds to high\ntemperature (ductile) thrusts (250\u00b0, 55-70\u00b0 NW), that\nwere mostly erased by the main syn- to post-metamor-\nphic peak D2 event. This corresponds to the dextral\nmegashear APPS system (50-65\u00b0, 70-85\u00b0 NW). Finally, a\nD3 fragile/brittle event is simultaneous with reactivation\nof D2 conjugated fault systems (290-320\u00b0, subvertical). \n\nIntense granulite facies metamorphism produced\ngeneralized migmatization and granitoid production by\npartial melting of paragneisses. Outcrops in the area\ncomprise the referred migmatites, granulites and blasto-\nmylonites that resulted from late retrogression of the\nother rock types. Migmatites (Fig. 4a-b) show a clear\n\nFig. 3  \u2013 a) Location of the studied S\u00e3o Fidelis \u2013 Santo Ant\u00f3nio de P\u00e1dua sector in central Ribeira Fold Belt, northern Rio de Janeiro State, SE\nBrazil (Modified from TROUW et al., 2000; HEILBRON &amp; MACHADO, 2003).

These rocks present\ngneissic foliation and banding, as well as clear evidences\nof late deformation and retrogression. These are associa-\nted with large elongated or rounded, undeformed and\nhomogeneous granitic to migmatitic batholiths (diatexi-\ntes), that represent a more advanced stage of anatexis of\nthe migmatites. Marbles are occasionally interlayered in\nthe migmatites as decametric to kilometric thick bands or\nsmall metric pockets. In the study area, granulites range\nfrom charnockites (s. s.) (Fig. 4c) to enderbites (basic\ngranulites) that crop out as elongated NE-SW trending\nmassifs and are overthrusted onto the migmatites during\nD2 and D3 deformation phases (FONSECA et al., 2008). \n\nBlastomylonites resulted from the deformation and\nretrogression of the other rock types in areas closer to the\nAPPS main shears (Fig. 4d). They represent the\ndeformed and retrogressed equivalents of the granulites\n(mainly) and of the migmatites. \n\n3. PETROGRAPHY\n\nPetrographic observations and a mineral chemistry\nsynthesis for the studied rocks are provided in this\nsection with the exception of garnet and biotite mineral\nchemistry that will be provided with more detail below. \n\n3.1. Migmatites\n\nPaleosome commonly comprises a g + bi + q + pl\n(Xan = 0.26 \u2013 0.43; Xor = 0.01 \u2013 0.04) + ksp (Xab &lt;0.1;\nXan &lt;0.01) \u00b1 mt \u00b1 sill \u00b1 ilm (Mineral abbreviations\naccording to POWELL &amp; HOLLAND, 1999) gneissic asso-\nciation, whereas the neosomatic fraction consists of a\ng + bi + pl (Xan = 0.27 \u2013 0.42; Xor = 0.01 \u2013 0.04) + q + ksp\n(Xab &lt;0.1; Xan &lt;0.01) \u00b1 sill \u00b1 ap mineral association\n(Fig. 5a). Migmatites do not show significant composi-\ntional difference between paleosome and neosome,\nincluding for garnets and biotites (see below).

M. BENTO DOS SANTOS; J. M. MUNH\u00c1; C. C. G. TASSINARI &amp; P. E. FONSECA\n\ngranolepidoblastic texture present in both paleosome and\nneosome, largely defined by the biotite + quartz associa-\ntion, is commonly obliterated by coarse grained, some-\ntimes centimetric, subhedral or rounded poikiloblastic\ngarnet, plagioclase and K-feldspar granoblasts. They fre-\nquently have matrix mineral inclusions, such as biotite,\nquartz and magnetite. These megablasts are usually\ndeformed, bent or cracked and show recrystallized rims.\nThe garnet \u2013 plagioclase \u2013 K-feldspar granoblastic\nassemblage represents the metamorphic peak paragenesis\nof the migmatites, possibly with small amounts of quartz\nand residual biotite. \n\nThe presence of biotite and sillimanite at garnet rims\nis a clear evidence of retrogression by garnet consump-\ntion. Symplectitic biotite + quartz + sillimanite growth\nafter garnet is a common feature of these rocks. In some\ncases, these migmatites are intensively sheared, origina-\nting a fine grained mylonitic banding with abundant silli-\nmanite (Fig. 5b). \n\n3.2. Granulites \n\nIsotropic charnockites (s. s.) show a medium to coarse\nsized granoblastic texture with megablastic (sometimes\ncentimetric) subhedral g + pl (Xan = 0.29 \u2013 0.51; Xor =\n= 0 \u2013 0.03) + ksp (Xab &lt;0.1 and Xan &lt;0.01) + opx\n(Xen = 0.39 \u2013 0.48; Xwo &lt;0.03) assemblage. Bi + q + mt\n+ ilm + ap + zrc are only present as diffuse, rarely orien-\ntated, matrix minerals (Fig. 5c). Biotites are frequently\nincluded in garnet and rarely in orthopyroxene mega-\nblasts. Bi + q symplectites are common around garnet\nand pyroxene rims, revealing that the retrometamorphic\npath involved significant deformation with decompres-\nsion. \n\nSome granulites are extensively sheared and retro-\ngressed, showing a fine grained mylonitic or cataclastic\ntexture with g + bi + pl + q + ksp + opx (relic) \u00b1 ap \u00b1 hb\n(XMg = 0.35 \u2013 0.65) mineral assemblage (Fig. 5d).\nMetamorphic peak minerals (pl + ksp + q + opx + g) are\nintensively deformed, fractured, grinded and replaced by\nan amphibolite facies assemblage of bi + hb. \n\nEnderbites are banded, medium to coarse grained\nand have a subhedral g + pl (Xan = 0.29 \u2013 0.51; Xor =\n= 0 \u2013 0.03) + opx (Xen = 0.41 \u2013 0.44; Xwo &lt;0.02) + cpx\n(Xen = 0.30 \u2013 0.35; Xwo = 0.42 \u2013 0.48) metamorphic peak\nparagenesis. This assemblage is often replaced by the hb\n(XMg = 0.35 \u2013 0.65) + pl (Xan = 0.29 \u2013 42; Xor = 0 \u2013 0.03)\n\u00b1 bi amphibolite facies assemblage (Fig. 5e). \n\n3.3. Blastomylonites \n\nMigmatites and granulites are profusely deformed\nand retrogressed in the near region of Santo Ant\u00f3nio de\nP\u00e1dua, centre of the APPS system. There, it is very diffi-\ncult to determine if the observed rocks were granulites or\nmigmatites because of the blastomylonitic transforma-\ntion they experienced. Therefore, the broad term blasto-\nmylonite is employed. \n\nPetrographic features indicate that they are equivalent\nto their undeformed counterparts, with the exception of\nhaving a profuse equigranular mylonitic texture and\nfinely recrystallized mineral grains (Fig. 5f). Mineralo-\ngical replacement of metamorphic peak assemblage\nprogresses in the same way as previously stated for\nmigmatites and granulites, but in blastomylonites there\nare only remnants of the high grade paragenesis. There-\nfore, the typical mineral assemblage of blastomylonites\nis pl (Xan = 0.17 \u2013 0.55; Xor = 0.01 \u2013 0.02) + bi + q + ksp\n(Xab &lt;0.22; Xan &lt;0.01) with some small relics of the\nhigh temperature minerals, such as garnet, orthopyro-\nxene (Xen = 0.41 \u2013 0.44; Xwo &lt;0.02) or clinopyroxene\n(Xen = 0.30 \u2013 0.35; Xwo = 0.42 \u2013 0.48). \n\n4. GARNET AND BIOTITE MINERAL\nCHEMISTRY\n\nSamples were prepared for the different types of\nanalyses at the Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias da Universidade\nde S\u00e3o Paulo (IGc-USP) and at the Departamento de\nGeologia da Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da Universidade de\nLisboa (DG-FCUL). \n\nMineral composition data were determined on carbon\ncoated polished thin sections using a JEOL JXA 733\nwavelength dispersive Electron Microprobe, at the\nCentro de Geologia da Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da\nUniversidade de Lisboa (CeGUL). Minerals were\nanalysed with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and a\ncurrent of 25 nA, using a beam of 5 \u00b5m. Both natural and\nsynthetic silicates were used as standards. Errors are\ntypically below 1.5 wt% for major elements. \n\nAn extensive mineral chemistry study on garnets,\nbiotite inclusions in garnets and matrix biotites was\nperformed in the studied rocks, namely major element\nanalyses of rim \u2013 core \u2013 rim (RCR) profiles in garnets\nand garnet \u2013 biotite interface (GBI) profiles in garnets.\nThese results were obtained in granulites and in the paleo-\nsomes (mainly) of migmatites. However, no significant\n\n \n\n\n\nAssumptions and problems with Fe-Mg garnet \u2013 biotite diffusion based petrological cooling rates 89\n\nFig. 5  \u2013 Petrographic observations of the studied rocks: a) Migmatite paleosome with a garnet megablast surrounded by a granolepidoblastic matrix.\nb) Deformed and sheared migmatite neosome with retrogressed biotite + quartz + sillimanite assemblage. c) Isotropic granulites showing an\northopyroxene megablast surrounded by late biotite. d) Deformed and sheared granulites showing fine grained mylonitic granolepidoblastic\ntexture. e) Coarse grained enderbite with some amphibolitization of the peak garnet + clinopyroxene assemblage. f) Profuse equigranular\nmylonitic texture with abundant finely recrystallized mineral grains in blastomylonites.\n\ncompositional variation was found for paleosomes and\nneosomes of the migmatite samples. \n\nThe following mineral chemistry data on garnets and\nbiotites is summarized due to the extensive number of\nchemical analyses performed in both garnet and biotite\n(over 2500 and over 1800 analyses, respectively).\nExamples of RCR profiles of the studied garnets are\nprovided in Fig. 6 as a synthesis. GBI profiles in garnets\n\nand summarized analyses of biotite inclusions are\nprovided in the petrological cooling rates section. \n\nMineral chemistry results for blastomylonites are\npresented as a synthesis in order to be compared with\ntheir undeformed equivalents. However, due to the\nextensive shearing and metamorphic recrystallization\nthat characterize these rocks, no attempt to obtain petro-\nlogical cooling rates in blastomylonites was performed. \n\n\n\n90 T. M. BENTO DOS SANTOS; J. M. MUNH\u00c1; C. C. G. TASSINARI &amp; P. E. FONSECA\n\n4.1. Garnets \n\nGarnets are almandine-rich in all rock types, with\nXalm always higher than 0.54 and always with Mg-richer\ncores compared to the rims. All rock types show the same\nzoning pattern from core (Mg-richer) to rim (Fe-richer),\nbut display very different range of values, namely Xalm =\n0.61 to 0.75 and Xpy = 0.07 to 0.21 for granulites, Xalm\n= 0.54 to 0.77 and Xpy = 0.07 to 0.37 for migmatites and\nXalm = 0.59 to 0.77 and Xpy = 0.11 to 0.19 for blastomy-\nlonites. Migmatites do not show significant composi-\ntional difference between paleosome and neosome. They\npresent the highest pyrope contents and variable grossu-\nlar contents ranging from Xgr = 0.01 to 0.27. Although\nthe highest value of Xgr is present in a migmatite, granu-\nlites are normally richer in calcium, with Xgr ranging\nfrom 0.02 to 0.22. Spessartine contents are always low\n(normally Xspss &lt;0.1), reaching a maximum of 0.13 in\ngranulites and migmatites. Examples of compositional\nRCR profiles of garnets from both rock types are\nprovided in Fig. 6a-d. \n\n4.2. Biotites \n\nGranulites have matrix biotites with XMg ranging\nfrom 0.39 to 0.55 and high TiO2 contents ranging from\n3.8 to 6.3 wt%. Migmatites show a great range of XMg\ncontents ranging from 0.36 to Fe-poor matrix biotites\nwith XMg = 0.76, whereas TiO2 contents range between\n3.7 to 4.5 wt%. This XMg range is observable in both\npaleosome and neosome. Blastomylonites show XMg\nvalues similar to granulites (0.39 to 0.55) and TiO2\ncontents ranging from 4.9 \u2013 5.8 wt%. Fe/Mg composition\nand size of biotite inclusions in garnet from migmatites\nand granulites are synthesized in Tables 1a-f and will be\nfurther discussed below. \n\n5. PETROLOGICAL COOLING RATES \n\nAs previously referred, diffusion induced by compo-\nsitional variation in the garnet-biotite interface is a func-\ntion of Kd(Mg/Fe)Garnet-Biotite in response to thermal\nchanges, such as cooling during retrograde path.\nFe/(Fe+Mg) results in garnet and biotite inclusions can\nthus be transformed in its respective closure temperature\n(Tc) and converted in terms of thermochronological\nevolution by obtaining cooling rates. \n\nThis work uses two significantly different metho-\ndologies that relies on Fe-Mg exchange between garnet\nand biotite inclusions: a) the method proposed by SPEAR\n&amp; PARRISH (1996), based on Fe-Mg exchange modelling\nbetween a garnet megablast and its corresponding biotite\ninclusions; b) the method proposed by GANGULLY et al.\n(1998) that uses garnet compositional profiles near the\ngarnet/biotite inclusion interface in order to infer meta-\nmorphic cooling rates. These methods are relatively\nrecent but have been applied successfully in other\norogenic belts (e.g.: SPEAR &amp; PARRISH, 1996; MUNH\u00c1 et\nal., 2005; STORM &amp; SPEAR, 2005). \n\n5.1. The SPEAR &amp; PARRISH (1996) method\n\nThis method is based on Fe-Mg exchange modelling\nbetween a garnet megablast and its corresponding biotite\ninclusions. Fe/(Fe+Mg) variations will be a function of\nbiotite inclusions size if diffusion is exclusive between\ngarnet and the several biotites included. This will\nproduce larger compositional variations in smaller biotite\ninclusions. Therefore, Fe/(Fe+Mg) in each inclusion can\nbe transformed in its respective apparent closure temper-\nature using the garnet\u2019s core composition and the FERRY\n&amp; SPEAR (1978) thermometer (Tab. 1a-f). Cooling rates\nare obtained using the diffusion coefficients of\nCHAKRABORTY &amp; GANGULLY (1992), as shown in Fig. 7\nand 8. \n\nFig. 7 shows that some Fe/Mg results are indeed\ncorrelated with biotite inclusions size, providing trends\nfor some migmatites and granulites, whereas others\nprovide significant dispersion and no correlation.\nHowever, samples that provide correlation trends\nbetween Fe/Mg results and biotite inclusions size are\nnot significantly different in Fe/Mg contents, having\nFe/Mg variation &lt;0.2, in most cases (Table 1a-f). This\nis problematic, since small amplitudes in Fe/Mg of\nbiotite inclusions provide a very narrow variation for\napparent closure temperatures, as can be seen in Table 1\nand Fig. 8. \n\nThe several petrological cooling rates plots, summa-\nrized in Fig. 8, allow us to state that samples that show\nhigh Fe/Mg dispersion, also show significant closure\ntemperature dispersion (Fig. 8 a-c) with cooling rates\nspanning from 0.1 to 200\u00b0C/Ma, whereas samples that\nshow very narrow Fe/Mg variation provide flat closure\ntemperature patterns (Fig. 8 d-f) with cooling rates span-\nning from 1 to 200\u00b0C/Ma. \n\n\n\nAssumptions and problems with Fe-Mg garnet \u2013 biotite diffusion based petrological cooling rates 91\n\nFig. 6  \u2013 Examples of compositional RCR profiles in garnets from migmatites (Fig. 6a-b) and granulites (Fig. 6c-d).

Fig. 6a shows a typical zoning pattern for garnet\n(as described in the text), increasing substantially the Fe/(Fe+Mg) values in the core area due to the proximity of a biotite inclusion; Fig. 6b\nshows a rare RCR profile where garnet does not present the expect results, which is probably due to garnet consumption or some other\nheterogeneity; Fig. 6c shows a typical diffusive RCR profile for garnet with a zoning pattern where Fe and Mn decreases and Mg increases\nfrom rim to core; Fig. 6d shows the same zoning pattern, but only in one rim.\n\n\n\n92 T.

It consists in modelling the variation of\ngarnet\u2019s composition in the interface with a biotite inclu-\nsion, from the biotite/garnet interface to an area of the\ngarnet that is far enough from the compositional effect\ncaused by the biotite inclusion, i.e. the plateau composi-\n\n\n\n94 T.

This method is significantly opposed to\nthe previous one because it does not use the compositio-\nnal variation of biotite inclusions, but the compositional\nvariation of garnet around the biotite inclusion. For this\nsecond method we used the software \u201cGARBIDIF\u201d\ndeveloped by MUNH\u00c1 (personal communication) and\nthe garnet Fe-Mg diffusion parameters of GANGULLY et\nal. (1998). \n\nA GBI compositional profile was obtained for granu-\nlite 153c and migmatite 73A (Tab. 2 a-b; Fig. 9-10)\naround the respective biotite inclusions. However, the\ngranulite garnet shows no Fe/(Fe/Mg) zoning in the inter-\nface with the biotite inclusion, even with a minimum\n\ndistance of analyse to the garnet \u2013 biotite interface being\n5 \u00b5m (Fig. 9). Migmatite 73A GBI profile shows 220 \u00b5m\nsize Fe/(Fe/Mg) zoning in the interface with the biotite\ninclusion (Fig. 10). This will be discussed in the following\nsection. \n\n6. DISCUSSION\n\nThe results obtained with the SPEAR &amp; PARRISH\n(1996) method are very difficult to interpret both for\ngranulites and migmatites, because biotite dimension\n(logarithmic) vs. garnet \u2013 biotite apparent closure\n\n\n\nAssumptions and problems with Fe-Mg garnet \u2013 biotite diffusion based petrological cooling rates 95\n\nFig. 9  \u2013 GBI compositional profile of garnet with no zoning pattern from near the biotite inclusion (at the left) to garnet core (at the right) in granulite\n153c.

(1998) method. Also present is the distance of the analysed garnet\nto the garnet-biotite inclusion interface. Fe/(Fe/Mg) variation is\nreduced, spanning from 0.825 to 0.808, suggesting that no Fe/(Fe/Mg)\ndiffusion occurred in the garnet \u2013 biotite interface.\n\nTABLE 2b\n\nGBI profile of migmatite 73A used in the application of the GANGULLY\net al. (1998) method. Also present is the distance of the analysed garnet\nto the garnet-biotite inclusion interface. Fe/(Fe/Mg) variation is signif-\nicant, spanning from 0.676 to 0.623, suggesting that Fe/(Fe/Mg) diffu-\nsion in the garnet \u2013 biotite interface occurred.\n\n\n\n96 T. M. BENTO DOS SANTOS; J. M. MUNH\u00c1; C. C. G. TASSINARI &amp; P. E. FONSECA\n\ntemperatures show very high dispersion of results. It is,\ntherefore, impossible to discriminate a cooling rates\ntrend (Fig. 8). Other samples (Fig. 8 d-f) show a very low\nrange of apparent closure temperatures for biotites that\nare very different in terms of size. This suggests that\ngarnet and its biotite inclusions must have been reequili-\nbrated (re-homogenized) at high temperatures and then\ncooled very fast, inhibiting significant change in the\nFe/Mg of biotite inclusions, and consequently, in the\napparent temperatures. In both cases, important assump-\ntions for the application of this method were not main-\ntained: cationic exchange with mass balance preservation\nbetween garnet and biotite inclusions (i.e. close system\nbehaviour) and/or sufficiently discriminating Fe/Mg\nvariation in biotite inclusions correlated with respective\nsize. Therefore, although this methodology provided\nsome insights regarding the general trends for cooling\npatterns, it did not constrain accurately the cooling rates\nof the studied rocks. \n\nThe obtained compositional profiles using the\nGANGULLY et al. (1998) method also provided unsatis-\nfactory results, since granulite 153c shows no type of\nFe/(Fe/Mg) garnet zoning in the interface with the biotite\ninclusion (Fig. 9). This implies that garnet was equili-\nbrated with a significant amount of biotite at high\ntemperatures, followed by very fast cooling that did not\nallow the formation of any type of zoning pattern (mini-\nmum distance of the analyses to the garnet \u2013 biotite inter-\nface is 5 \u00b5m). This hampers any type of inference regar-\n\nding petrological cooling rates. However, it is possible to\nconclude (qualitatively) that it must have been high\ntemperature maintenance for a substantial amount of\ntime (that allowed for the garnet to be homogenized),\nfollowed by a period of very fast cooling rates, as\nevidenced in samples 36Cb-1, 341a and 222-2 (Fig. 8 d-f).\nThis is in overall agreement with geochronological\ncooling rates provided by BENTO DOS SANTOS et al.\n(2008) (see below). \n\nMigmatite 73A garnet compositional profile (Fig. 10)\nin the interface with the biotite inclusion is significantly\nopposed to the previous one, because it presents a\npronounced zoning pattern from Fe/(Fe+Mg) higher\nvalues close to the biotite to more Mg-rich values far\nfrom the interface with the biotite inclusion. \n\nThe profile is divided in three parts (as evidenced in\nFig. 10): zone 1 (far from the biotite inclusion) shows\nplateau values (Fe/(Fe+Mg) = 0.623 \u2013 0.629; average\nFe/(Fe+Mg) = 0.6261), equivalent with the garnet\u2019s core\ncomposition far from the inclusions (compare with Fig. 11\nthat shows the RCR profile for the referred garnet; ave-\nrage core Fe/(Fe+Mg) = 0.628). This area of the profile\nis absent of Fe-Mg cation exchange between the garnet\nand the inclusion, i.e. there is preservation of garnet\u2019s\ninitial composition; zone 2 shows an apparent arithmetic\nincrease of Fe/(Fe + Mg) values according with proxi-\nmity to the biotite inclusion; and, finally, zone 3 shows\nan exponential Fe/(Fe + Mg) increase with proximity to\nthe biotite inclusion. \n\nFig. 10 \u2013 Zoned GBI compositional profile of the studied garnet in migmatite 73A, as explained in the text.\n\n\n\nAssumptions and problems with Fe-Mg garnet \u2013 biotite diffusion based petrological cooling rates 97\n\nModelling for this compositional profile is based on\nthe assumption that Fe-Mg cationic exchange between\ngarnet and corresponding biotite inclusion is exclusive\nand that mass balance preservation between both mine-\nrals occurred. Therefore, the effective dimensions of\neach mineral were used (garnet radius (RGarnet) is 1 mm\nand the average biotite dimension (RBiotite) is 0.1 mm) at\ndifferent cooling rates. The other diffusive parameters\nused were DFe/Mg\n\nBiotite = 100DFe/Mg\nGarnet; Initial\n\nTemperature (Ti) = 800\u00b0C and Initial Pressure (Pi) = 8 kbar\n(BENTO DOS SANTOS, 2008; MUNH\u00c1 et al., 2008);\nFe/(Fe+Mg)i\n\nGarnet = 0.6261). \nAfter performing several modelling with different\n\ncooling rates from 5 to 200\u00b0C/Ma (Fig. 12), it became\nevident that it was impossible to adequately adjust any\ncooling rate pattern to the obtained compositional\nprofile, especially in zone 2. The mentioned modelling,\nbesides not adjusting adequately to the profile, appa-\nrently would imply the possibility of having cooling rates\nso disparate as 5 and 200\u00b0C/Ma (Fig. 12). \n\nThe fact that none of the obtained modelling is adjus-\ntable to the GBI profile and because zone 2 presents\narithmetic increase, suggests the existence of non-exclu-\nsivity of diffusive processes between garnet and biotite\ninclusion. Hardly, such a small inclusion of biotite (0.1 mm\nradius) could cause such a significant increase in\nFe/(Fe+Mg) in a part of the garnet so far away from the\n\ninterface (220 \u00b5m), even with very low cooling rates.\nTherefore, it is suggested that garnet may have not\nmaintained equilibrium exclusively with the referred\nbiotite inclusion during an early period of its cooling.\nThis must have been caused by retrograde reaction\nprocesses (SPEAR &amp; FLORENCE, 1992; KOHN &amp; SPEAR,\n2000) with a large amount of biotite, such as matrix\nbiotite. Modelling performed with similar amounts of\ngarnet and biotite (RGarnet = 1mm; RBiotite = 1mm;\nDFe/Mg\n\nBiotite = 100DFe/Mg\nGarnet; Ti = 800\u00b0C; Pi = 8 kbar;\n\nFe/(Fe+Mg)i\nGarnet = 0.6261) at different cooling rates\n\n(Fig. 13) show very reasonable adjustment to zones 1 and\n2, suggesting initial very high cooling rates (50 to\n200\u00b0C/Ma), but a pronounced difference to the composi-\ntional profile in zone 3. \n\nThus, migmatite 73A must have had a very complex\ncooling pattern during which remained in equilibrium\nwith a biotite reservoir such as available matrix biotite\n(in an early period when biotite was very abundant or\nwhen garnet had smaller dimensions than presently) at\nhigh cooling rates. This was probably followed by a\nperiod when garnet must have been in exclusive equili-\nbrium with its biotite inclusion at lower temperatures.\nHowever, the aforementioned cooling pattern, inferred\nby combining the two modelling with different gar-\nnet/biotite volume proportions, cannot simply be put\ntogether to infer a coherent cooling pattern, because the\n\nFig. 11 \u2013 RCR compositional profile of the studied garnet in migmatite 73A. Xalm and Xpy are plotted in the main axis (at the left), whereas Xspss and\nXgr are plotted in the secondary axis (at the right). This garnet does not show a typical RCR zoning pattern, because the left rim shows plateau\nvalues, probably due to retrograde consumption of garnet.\n\n\n\n98 T. M. BENTO DOS SANTOS; J. M. MUNH\u00c1; C. C. G. TASSINARI &amp; P. E. FONSECA\n\nkinetics of garnet-biotite diffusion of each step is non-\nreproducible. This was confirmed when several model-\nling were performed by combining a first non-diffusive\n(open-system behaviour) followed by a purely diffusive\n(closed-system behaviour) Fe-Mg exchange between\ngarnet and biotite. No modelling provided reasonable\nresults compatible with the obtained garnet composi-\ntional profile near the biotite inclusion. \n\nIt can be concluded, after the use of two significantly\ndifferent methodologies to obtain petrological cooling\nrates, that there was not exclusivity of mass balanced\ndiffusive processes between the studied garnets and\nrespective biotite inclusions. The system was opened to\nreaction processes with the rock\u2019s matrix, which\nincreases the difficulty of using these methodologies.\nTherefore, the existence of non-diffusive processes in\n\nFig. 12 \u2013 Zoned compositional profile of garnet from migmatite 73A (as in Fig. 10) plotted with the different modelling results at different cooling\nrates, based on the assumption that garnet \u2013 biotite inclusion cationic diffusion is exclusive. As can be seen, the GBI profile is only adequate\nin zone 3, near the biotite inclusion, implying the possibility of having cooling rates as different as 5 and 200\u00baC/Ma.\n\nFig. 13 \u2013 Zoned compositional profile of garnet from migmatite 73A (as in Fig. 10) plotted with the different modelling results at different cooling\nrates, based on the assumption that garnet was in equilibrium with reasonable amounts of matrix biotite. As can be seen, the GBI profile is\nonly adequate to zones 1 and 2 (far from the biotite inclusion) implying very high cooling rates from 50 to 200\u00baC/Ma.\n\n\n\nAssumptions and problems with Fe-Mg garnet \u2013 biotite diffusion based petrological cooling rates 99\n\ngarnet, as well as the possibility of plastic deformation of\ngarnet at high temperatures (STOREY &amp; PRIOR, 2005),\nsuch as those estimated for peak metamorphic conditions\nin central RFB (T = 800 \u2013 900\u00b0C; BENTO DOS SANTOS,\n2008; MUNH\u00c1 et al., 2008), makes it very hard to apply\nthis methodologies, since deformation at high tempera-\ntures reduces the effective dimension of garnet and\nallows the interaction between garnet\u2019s core and matrix\nbiotite. Probably, this is also the cause for the high\ndispersion of results in some samples used for the\nSPEAR &amp; PARRISH (1996) method. \n\nBENTO DOS SANTOS et al. (2008) provided ther-\nmochronological constraints for the SFSAP sector based\non integration of multiple isotopic systems and\nconcluded that migmatites were cooled at relatively\nstable 3 \u2013 5\u00b0C/Ma, whereas granulites were maintained\nat lower crustal levels and very slowly cooled (&lt;2\u00b0C/Ma)\nduring long-term sub-horizontal transpressive shearing\n(FONSECA et al., 2008). This period of slow-cooling\nendured until orogenic collapse occurred, leading to\nabrupt fast cooling of granulites (8 to 30\u00b0C/Ma) in the\nlast stages of Brasiliano Orogeny. The present petrologi-\ncal cooling rates are very difficult to interpret and to\nquantify, but provide qualitative results in agreement\nwith BENTO DOS SANTOS et al. (2008) conclusions, such\nas the idea of having high temperature maintenance that\nreequilibrated the garnets, followed by very fast cooling\nthat did not allow significant Fe/Mg diffusion between\ngarnet and biotite inclusions. \n\nIntense deformation caused by the long-term sub-\n-horizontal transpressive shearing (FONSECA et al., 2008)\ncan be seen in sheared migmatites and granulites (as\ndescribed in the Petrography section of this work), as\nwell as in the fact that some are abundantly blastomy-\nlonitized. This is the probable cause for the open-system\nbehaviour found in some samples. It may have altered\nbiotite diffusion mechanisms and reequilibrated garnet\nwith minerals or fluids outside the garnet \u2013 biotite inclu-\nsion system, adding complexities and increasing the\nuncertainties regarding the use of these methodologies.\n\n7. CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe several obtained petrological cooling rates with\ntwo significantly different methodologies are very dubious\nand provide mainly qualitative results due to the\ncomplex evolution of the belt that allowed open-system\nbehaviour. This altered biotite diffusion mechanisms or\n\nreequilibrated garnet with minerals or fluids outside the\ngarnet \u2013 biotite inclusion system. Nevertheless, the\npresented results, although very difficult to interpret and\nto quantify, provide qualitative results that are in broad\nagreement with previously obtained geochronological\ncooling rates. Thermochronology based on integration of\nmultiple isotopic systems are thus more accurate for\ninferring cooling rates in rocks that endured complex\ncooling patterns, significant deformation and Fe-Mg\nopen-system behaviour. \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nFAPESP, POCA-PETROLOG (CEGUL, UI: 263;\nPOCTI/FEDER), GEODYN (POCTI \u2013 ISFL \u2013 5 \u2013 32) and\na PhD scholarship from FCT (SFRH/BD/17014/2004)\nco-financed by FEDER provided support for field and\nanalytical work.
