The objective of this study was to perform a survey of water quality and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates \nin two sub-basins at the Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge in the Brazilian state of Sergipe. The collection of data in the \nfield, laboratory processing, and the interpretation and discussion of data were conducted in groups by students from two \npostgraduate programmes in Ecology and Conservation (UFMG and UFS), personnel of the state environment agency \n(SEMARH), school teachers from the local town of Capela, and members of the reserve\u2019s voluntary fire brigade. The \nresults of the assessment were organised, analysed, and presented at the reserve headquarters in the form of posters, \nfor the development of environmental education activities with pupils from local schools, as well as contributing to \na SEMARH seminar. Samples were characterised by distinct taxonomic compositions and diversity, as confirmed by \nMDS and additive partitioning of diversity analyses. The gravel substrate presented the lower mean taxonomic richness \nin each sampling unit (a\n\n1\n = 28%), while the average difference among samples (b\n\n1 \ndiversity) was elevated for both \n\nsubstrates (39% for leaf litter, 41% for gravel), reflecting the pronounced variation among samples, even adjacent \nones within the same stream. Diversity between streams was lower in the case of leaf litter in comparison with gravel \n(b\n\n2\n = 21 and 31%, respectively). A total of 57 fish specimens were collected with a predominance of individuals of the \n\norders Characiformes (62%) and Perciformes (21%). This rapid ecological assessment confirmed the importance of \nthe conservation unit and emphasised the need for its continuation, given its importance for the maintenance of water \nquality and its other ecological services, such as the conservation of the region\u2019s aquatic biodiversity and providing \nthe local town of Capela (circa 20,000 inhabitants) with its water supply, the Mata do Junco being its only source.\n\nKeywords: in situ training, postgraduate programme, biodiversity conservation, protected areas.\n\nAvalia\u00e7\u00e3o ecol\u00f3gica r\u00e1pida de indicadores bent\u00f4nicos de qualidade de \u00e1gua:  \numa experi\u00eancia de sucesso na forma\u00e7\u00e3o de p\u00f3s-graduandos em ecologia no Brasil\n\nResumo\n\nProtocolos de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o ecol\u00f3gica r\u00e1pida s\u00e3o ferramentas importantes para treinamento de p\u00f3s-graduandos e levantamento \nde informa\u00e7\u00f5es em \u00e1reas pouco conhecidas.

Introduction\n\nProtected areas are effective at safeguarding forest \ncover, when the principal objective is to conserve habitats \nand diversity, and avoid deforestation. However, reserves \nare not necessarily effective against hunting pressure, and \nare often too small to sustain viable populations of many \nspecies (Adeney et al., 2009). In Brazil, in addition, there is \na scarcity of trained personnel, and most conservation units \nare under-staffed (Brooks et al., 2006; Mittermeir et al., \n2005), especially considering the need for data on species \ndistributions and vulnerability, and the extinction risk of a \nrepresentative subset of species (Hanson et al., 2009). There \nis a clear need for the provision of funding for specific \ntraining programmes at local universities (Scarano, 2007), \nas well as the development of management protocols for \nthe orientation of local political leaderships.\n\nThe decision of the United Nations to promote 2010 \nas the International Year of Biodiversity highlights the \nshortcomings between the urgency of the measures required \nand the current levels of commitment (Stuart et al., 2010). \nYoung conservationists face an immensurable biodiversity \ncrisis, with current species extinction rates as much as \none thousand times higher than background rates. Urgent \ninvestment in capacity-building is obviously needed, and \nthis has been a priority in Brazil in recent years, where it has \ninvolved federal, state and local agencies and institutions, \nas well as NGOs, field technicians and managers of \nprotected areas interested in conservation biology. The \ndevelopment of local leaderships and capacity-building \ninitiatives has the potential to guarantee the success of \nconservation initiatives in terms of the area protected, \nreduction in deforestation rates and population decline, \nas well as influencing policy-making and legislation at \nlocal, regional, and national levels.\n\nLittle is known of the diversity of tropical \u201chotspots\u201d \n(Myers et al., 2000) in comparison with their temperate \ncounterparts (Boyero, 2000; Yule et al., 2010), especially \nwhen it comes to their aquatic systems. Tropical forests \ncontain the majority of terrestrial species diversity, and \nthe Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome is a prominent hotspot, \nespecially given that less than 3% of its original forest \ncover remains (Fonseca et al., 2007). Between one and \ntwo million square kilometres are deforested per decade \n\nworldwide, resulting in the release of considerable quantities \nof carbon into the atmosphere (Joppa et al., 2008). Despite \nits importance, the related loss of the water quality of aquatic \nsystems is still relatively poorly understood (Brooks et al., \n2006). Fortunately, there is a growing assumption that \nBrazilian aquatic ecosystems are increasingly threatened \nby anthropogenic impacts (Pompeu et al., 2005; Moreno \nand Callisto, 2006; Moulton and Wantzen, 2006 and \nreferences therein).\n\nRapid bioassessment protocols are used to assess the \nbiological quality of the water and the ecological integrity \nof aquatic ecosystems (Barbosa and Callisto, 2000). \nWhile these procedures offer the advantages of low cost \nand reduced time in the field and laboratory, they must \nbe evaluated carefully in order to guarantee the quality \nof the data collected (Maltichik and Callisto, 2004). The \ntaxonomic resolution of this type of analysis varies from \ngenus to order. A higher resolution tends to be used in \nmost studies, given its more favourable cost-benefit ratio \nin comparison with the identification of species (Buss \nand Vitorino, 2010).\n\nIn this context, an important recent initiative of the \nBrazilian Higher Education Authority (CAPES) has been \nthe installation of a postgraduate exchange programme, \nwhich permits systematic interchange between postgraduate \ncourses in different regions of the country. A programme \nwas established between the postgraduate programmes \nin Ecology at the federal universities of Minas Gerais \n(UFMG), in southeastern Brazil, and Sergipe (UFS), in \nthe northeast of the country. As part of the exchange, a \nshort-term field course was conducted in March, 2010, \nat the Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge in Sergipe, which \nprotects an important area of Atlantic Forest, and in \nparticular, the local population of the endangered endemic \nmonkey, Callicebus coimbrai Kobayashi &amp; Langguth, 1999. \nThis course promoted collaboration between academic \nresearchers, state and federal environment technicians, and \npostgraduate students. Assessment of aquatic ecosystems \nwas based on the AquaRap approach (Mittermeier and \nForsyth, 1992; Chernoff et al., 1996), which permits the \nreliable evaluation of a large number of sites during a short \nperiod of time (Barbosa and Callisto, 2000). The objective \n\nde recursos h\u00eddricos no estado de Sergipe. As amostras de fundo apresentaram composi\u00e7\u00f5es taxon\u00f4micas e diversidade \ndiferentes, como mostraram as an\u00e1lises de ordena\u00e7\u00e3o MDS e de parti\u00e7\u00e3o aditiva da diversidade. O substrato cascalho \napresentou menor riqueza taxon\u00f4mica m\u00e9dia em cada unidade amostral (a\n\n1\n = 28%) e a diferen\u00e7a m\u00e9dia entre amostragens \n\n(diversidade b\n1\n) foi elevada nos dois casos (39% em folhi\u00e7o, 41% em cascalho), indicando a alta varia\u00e7\u00e3o que h\u00e1 entre \n\namostras espacialmente pr\u00f3ximas em um mesmo riacho. A diversidade entre riachos foi menor em folhi\u00e7o do que em \ncascalho (b\n\n2\n = 21 e 31%, respectivamente).

It is hoped that these same areas will be included \nin long-term ecological monitoring programs, based on \nthe collection of more detailed data, including more ample \ninventories and surveys, and biomonitoring procedures.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n\n2.1. Study area\n\nThe Mata do Junco State Wildlife Refuge was created \nin 2007 with the primary objective of protecting the \nendangered primate C. coimbrai. The reserve is located \nin the 197.7 km2 basin of the Japaratuba river (10\u00b0 14\u2019 00\u201d \nand 10\u00b0 48\u2019 00\u201d S; 37\u00b0 18\u2019 00\u201d and 36\u00b0 48\u2019 00\u201d W), which \nis within planning unit 204, in the municipality of Capela, \nin the Brazilian state of Sergipe (Cunha, 2001). The Mata \ndo Junco sub-basin is formed by 14 springs, only three of \nwhich are preserved. Six others have been altered, while the \nremaining five have been degraded, based on an analysis \nof the vegetation surrounding the spring, and the type of \nland use of the adjacent area (Ferreira et al., 2007).\n\nThe two sub-basins \u2013 Lagartixo and Bica do Estreiro \u2013 \nthat originate within the conservation unit were evaluated \nin the present study. Five points were sampled in the \nLagartixo sub-basin: P01 \u2013 spring in a semi-lentic reach \nwith abundant deposits of leaf detritus; P02 \u2013 downstream \nfrom this spring, with extensive gallery forest; P03 \u2013 spring \nlocated in an area with limited anthropogenic impact; \nP04 \u2013 stream with dark-colored water, deposits of clay, \ndownstream from P03; P05 \u2013 reach downstream from the \ncatchment station of the Autonomous Water and Sewage \nService (SAAE) of the municipality of Capela, formed by \nthe confluence of the two springs. The other four points \nwere located in the Bica do Estreito sub-basin: P06 \u2013 dark-\nwater stream adjacent to a bamboo stand; P07 \u2013 stream \nlocated downstream from the Bica do Estreito spring; \nP08 \u2013 stream within a bamboo stand, downstream of the \nconfluence of points P06 and P07; P09 \u2013 narrow stream, \nafter a dam, flows into the main stream at P08.\n\n2.2. Methods\n\n2.2.1. Physical and chemical characteristics\n\nA rapid assessment protocol for the evaluation of \necological conditions and habitat diversity in hydrographic \nbasins, as proposed by Callisto et al. (2002a), was adopted \nfor the present study. In addition, a qualitative survey of \nthe vegetation in the surrounding area was conducted using \na procedure adapted from Chagas (2009).\n\nAt the nine in situ sample points (P01-09), data on \nthe pH, electrical conductivity, resistivity, temperature, \nand total dissolved solids in the water were collected \nusing a multiparameter Yellow Springs apparatus. The air \ntemperature, and the depth, width, and flow velocity of \nthe stream reaches were also measured. In the laboratory, \n\nturbidity was analysed using a desktop turbidity-meter, total \nalkalinity was determined by the Gran method (Carmouze, \n1994), while dissolved oxygen concentrations were measured \nby the Winkler method. Water samples were collected \nfor laboratory analysis in order to determine total-P and \ntotal-N\n\n \nconcentrations, following Golterman et al. (1978) \n\nand Mackereth et al. (1978), respectively.\nDiversity of freshwater bioindicators\nSamples of the organic (leaf litter deposits) and inorganic \n\n(gravel) substrates were collected from each stream. Both \ntypes of material are common in the two sub-basins. Five \nreplicates of each substrate were randomly collected \nfrom each system (50 meters reach), using a Surber-type \nsampler with an area of 0.09 m2 and a 250 mm mesh. In \nthe laboratory, the samples were washed in 250 mm-mesh \nsieves and all organisms were separated and identified to \nthe family level.\n\nA Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) analysis \nbased on Bray-Curtis distances was used to determine \nwhether the samples from the two types of substrate had \ndistinct taxonomic composition. The difference between \nthe richness and density of invertebrates associated with the \nleaf banks of the stream bottoms was evaluated statistically \nusing a t-test. An additive partitioning analysis of diversity \n(as proposed by Veech et al., 2002) was applied separately to \nthe data from each substrate with the objective of identifying \nthe spatial scales that contribute most, proportionately, to \ntotal richness. The mean richness observed in the Surber \nsamples was defined as the diversity on the lowest scale \nanalysed (a\n\n1\n). The difference among samples was defined \n\nas b\n1\n diversity, while the difference between streams was \n\ndenominated b\n2\n diversity.\n\nThe multimetric benthic index developed by Ferreira et al. \n(2011) was used for the evaluation of water quality. This \nindex evaluates a set of benthic parameters (Richness, % \nOligochaeta, % CHOL \u2013 Chironomidade + Oligochaeta, \n% EPT \u2013 Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera, \n% collector-gatherers and BMWP-CETEC \u2013 Biological \nMonitoring Working Party). Each parameter is attributed a \nscore (1, 3, or 5) according to the response of the organism \nto impact (Table 1). The index is the sum of these scores, \nwhich has a maximum possible value of 30. Scores are \nallocated to four categories of water quality: bad (6-12), \n\nTable 1. Metrics used in benthic biotic index calcula-\ntion (Taxonomic richness, % Oligochaeta, % CHOL \u2013 \n Chironomidae + Oligochaeta, % EPT \u2013 Ephemeroptera, \nPlecoptera, Trichoptera, % Collector-gatherers and BMWP \n\u2013 CETEC \u2013 Biological Monitoring Working Party).\n\nMetrics\nScores\n\n5 3 1\nRichness ?9 8-6 5?\n% Oligochaeta ?5 6-46 ?47?97\n% CHOL ?73 74-86 ?87?100\n% EPT ?6 5-3 ?2\n% Collector-gatherers ?64 65-83 ?84?99\nBMWP-CETEC ?36 35-18 ?17\n\n\n\nBraz.

The \nbenthic macroinvertebrate communities were classified in \nfunctional feeding groups according to the feeding strategies \nof these organisms in the ecosystems under analysis.\n\nSamples of the benthic macroinvertebrates floating in \nthe streams were collected using drift nets (2500 cm2 in \narea, with a 250 mm mesh), which were set for a period \nof 24 hours. Three drift nets were set in each stream, \nand differences between streams were evaluated through \nestimates of taxonomic richness, equitability (Pielou), \ndiversity (Shannon-Wiener) and density (individuals per \nm3). The material collected in the nets was removed, washed \nin a sieve, processed, and identified in the laboratory. The \nwidth (m), depth (m), flow velocity (m/s), and discharge \n(m3/s) of the stream at each were measured. Differences \nbetween streams in the composition and diversity of the \nmacroinvertebrate fauna were tested using Student\u2019s t-test.\n\nQualitative samples of the local icthyofauna were \ncollected at two points in each stream, P01 and P05 in \nthe Lagartixo, and P06 and P08 in the Bica do Estreito. \nThe fish were captured in D-shaped hand-nets (1 mm \nmesh) and 3 m-long trawls (1 m high, 1 mm mesh). The \nspecimens collected were fixed in 10% formalin, weighed \non a 0.01-g precision scale, measured, and identified. The \nanalysis of the stomach contents of a sample of 39 fish \nwas used as a complementary approach to the inventory \nof the local benthic macroinvertebrates. The stomachs \nwere retrieved via ventral incision, and their contents \nwere investigated under a magnifying glass. The benthic \nmacroinvertebrates were separated and identified to the \nlowest taxonomic level (family).\n\n2.2.2. Environmental education\n\nA number of environmental education activities were \nconducted during the study period, involving pupils from \nfour local schools (three municipal and one state-run). \nThe pupils included children, adolescents, and adults \nwith special needs. The activities were: a) presentation \nof a documentary on the Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge; \nb) interactive exhibition using four different strategies: i) \nfree drawing for the assessment of existing knowledge; ii) \npresentation of posters providing information on the principal \nbioindicator organisms and their habitat; iii) mobile collection \nof organisms preserved in alcohol; iv) flannelgraph, used \nfor the assessment of the retention of information (metal \npanel simulating a river, the process of degradation, and \nits consequences for the aquatic community); c) game-\nplaying: \u201cplaying with the bioindicators of water quality\u201d, \nto reinforce the retention of the material presented (game \nin the round, where the participants represent the aquatic \ncommunity and a process of degradation is simulated, \nresulting in consequences for the ecosystem and the benthic \norganisms; d) field visit to the streams, using a simplified \nprotocol for the characterisation of ecological conditions \n\u2013 adapted from Callisto et al. (2002a) \u2013 during which \nbioindicator organisms are collected and the conservation \nstatus of the aquatic ecosystem is discussed.\n\n3. Results and Discussion\n\n3.1. Physical and chemical features\n\nThe riparian vegetation within the study area presented \nthree strata \u2013 arboreal, shrub, and herbaceous \u2013 with a \ncanopy that varies in height between 12 and 23 m. The leaf \nlitter was mostly homogeneous, with occasional deeper \ndeposits. There was relatively little anthropogenic impact \nor erosion, although a number of exotic plant species \n\u2013 Bambusa vulgaris Schrad, Bambusa vulgaris vittata \nMcClure, and Elaeis guineensis Jacq \u2013 were observed \nin both areas. The canopy is continuous on both stream \nsides, with few natural clearings.\n\nThe results of Callisto et al. (2002a) protocol applied in \nthe studied area indicated the presence of few anthropogenic \nimpacts, either adjacent to the streams or within the \nsurrounding area. The aquatic ecosystems were classified \nby the protocol as natural, varying between 71 points \nfor P04 and 95 points for P06. The principal factors \ndetermining the differences among sampling points were \na) the presence of exotic plant species; b) instability of \nthe margin (small areas of erosion); and c) sedimentary \ndeposits on the bottom.\n\nThe waters were relatively acid, with pH values ranging \nfrom 5.01 at P01 to 6.17 at P06. The buffering capacity of \nthe water (medium total alkalinity) was positive only at \nP02, P06, and P09 (9.08, 0.75, and 17.32 mEq/L of CO\n\n2\n, \n\nrespectively), which appears to emphasise the fragility of \nthe ecosystem (sensu Callisto et al., 1998).\n\nTotal dissolved solids and turbidity were relatively low, \nreflecting the well-preserved condition of the ecosystems, \nwith well-developed riparian forest and few areas of \nerosion. High levels of turbidity were recorded only in the \nLagartixo sub-basin (P04), where there is some evidence \nof disturbances prior to the creation of the conservation \nunit, and P09 (Bica do Estreito sub-basin), where a small \ndam had been constructed. Low Total-P and Total-N were \nfound in both sub-basins (<0.005 and&lt;0.063, respectively).\n\nThroughout the study area, with the exception of P04, \nthe sediment acts as a nutrient sink, indicated by the positive \nvalues of the oxi-redox potential. The negative value \nrecorded at P04 (\u2013266 mV) reflects the type of sediment \nat this point, which is made up of very fine particles (clay), \nwhich may result in anoxia at the bottom of the water \ncolumn (Table 2), corroborating Coiado (2004).\n\n3.2. Diversity of freshwater bioindicators\n\nA total of 1333 organisms were collected, representing \n32 families (Table 3). These included 28 families belonging \nto the class Insecta, two Crustacea, one Oligochaeta, and \none Arachnida.

The partition \nanalysis revealed a distinct distribution of diversity by \nsubstrate type (Figure 2).\n\nGravel showed the lowest mean richness per Surber \n(a\n\n1\n = 28%), which indicates that the samples were poorly \n\nrepresentative of the region\u2019s total taxonomic richness. \nThe b\n\n1\n diversity was relatively high for both substrates, \n\nhowever \u2013 39% for leaves and 41% for gravel \u2013 which \nindicates considerable variation among points, despite \ntheir relative proximity.\n\nThe leaf litter in the Bica do Estreito is formed mainly \nby bamboo leaves, which fall into the stream (only 10 leaf \nmorphotypes were found in the litter at the bottom of this \nstream). By contrast, the riparian vegetation of the Lagartixo \nsub-basin is typical of well-preserved Atlantic Forest. \nThis determines the difference in the leaf litter found in \nthis stream, which is characterized by a higher number of \nleaf morphotypes \u2013 25 in all. However, this difference in \nthe composition of the detritus and leaf biomass was not \nreflected in any major difference in the macroinvertebrate \ncommunities of the two sub-basins, as indicated by the \nNMS arrangement and the low diversity between streams \n(b\n\n2\n = 21% for the leaf substrate). In addition, neither the \n\nrichness nor abundance of the leaf banks varied significantly \nbetween streams (Figure 3), which indicates that, until \nnow, the presence of bamboo on the banks of the Bica do \n\nEstreito has not had a significant impact on the benthic \ncommunity. The b\n\n2\n diversity was greater for gravel (31%), \n\nwhich indicates greater heterogeneity between streams for \nthis type of substrate.\n\nBiotic index\nThe biotic benthic index applied in the present study \n\nindicated that both sub-basins had very good water \n\nFigure 1.

This score was based on the \nhigh taxonomic richness of the area, in addition to the \npresence of a number of organisms that are sensitive to \npollution and other anthropogenic impacts, such as larvae \nof the orders Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera, and Trichoptera. \nThe importance of the taxonomic richness as a metric that \nreflects the diversity of benthic organisms and the health \nof freshwaters is well known (Ferreira et al., 2011).\n\n Collector-gatherers and collector-filterers, which feed \non fine particles of organic matter, predominated in both \nareas (Figure 4). The proportion of predators was slightly \nhigher (14%) in the Bica do Estreito in comparison with the \nLagartixo (10%), although the proportions of grazers were \nslightly reversed. According to Tomanova et al. (2006), the \ngathering-collectors are frequently the dominant trophic \ngroup in tropical streams because of the abundance of \nresources produced by the rapid degradation of allochthonous \norganic matter.\n\nDrifting invertebrates\nA total of 137 invertebrate specimens were collected \n\nin the drift nets, representing 18 taxa: Baetidae (29), \nCalopterygidae (2), Ceratopogonidae (4), Chironomidae (12), \nCoenagrionidae (1), Elmidae (6), Gerridae (4), Hidracarina \n(17), Hydropsychidae (1), Hydroptilidae (1), Leptoceridae \n(4), Leptophlebiidae (5), Philopotamidae (5), Scirtidae \n(14), Simuliidae (18), Stenochiromus (5), Tipulidae (1), \nand Veliidae (8). Once again, no significant differences \nwere found in the composition or community structure \nof these organisms between the two sub-basins, although \nsome groups were restricted to one or a few sample points. \nWhile the discharge of the Bica do Estreito was greater, \ndensity was slightly higher in the Lagartixo (Table 4).\n\nIchthyofauna\nA total of 57 fishes were collected during the present \n\nstudy. These specimens represented eight different species \ndistributed in seven genera belonging to seven different \nfamilies, and five orders. Almost two-thirds (62%) of \nthe specimens belonged to the order Characiformes, \nfollowed by Perciformes (21%), Synbranchiformes (11%), \n\nSiluriformes (3%), and Gymnotiformes (3%). While \nNeotropical aquatic ecosystems tend to be dominated \nby siluriforms and characiforms (Castro, 1999), only the \nlatter predominated in the present study. In general, the \nspecies identified in the present study were typical of \nthose found in other hydrographic basins, such as those \nof the Rio S\u00e3o Francisco (Alves and Pompeu, 2010) and \nRio Grande (Castro et al., 2004).\n\nThe scarcity of siluriform fish may be related to the \npreference of these animals for specific types of habitat, \nwhere they normally seek refuge during the course of the day. \nIn addition, fish may often be relatively rare in headwater \nstreams, such as those studied here (Tupinamb\u00e1s et al., \n2007). Obviously, a more comprehensive inventory of \nthe ichthyofauna of the streams surveyed here and the rest \nof the Japaratuba basin would require the collection of a \nmuch more systematic sample, including a much longer \nperiod, covering seasonal variations in climate, and the \n\nFigure 3.

The taxonomic \nrichness of these organisms was relatively low in comparison \nwith the results of other studies based on a similar approach \n(Callisto et al., 2002b; Tupinamb\u00e1s et al., 2007). For more \nreliable and conclusive data on these parameters, a much \nlarger sample of fish would be required, in particular of \nbenthophagous species, which were not collected in the \npresent study and would increase the inventory of aquatic \ninsects (Fagundes et al., 2008).\n\nTraining in environmental education\nA total of 34 pupils were involved in the three visits to \n\nthe study area. These visits were based on the concept that \n\u201csocialisation of successful experiences in the divulgation \nof scientific knowledge on water through the \u2018Bioindicators \nof Water Quality\u2019 programme, which is based on the \nproduction and distribution of informative material on \nmethods and applications of game-playing\u201d. Given the \nassumption that environmental education aims primarily at \nthe development of \u201ccitizenship\u201d, the use of a game-playing \napproach is especially important because it transforms \ninformation on environmental problems into a simple and \nattractive format, capable of increasing the efficiency of \nthe process (Giron, 1992).\n\nAll the pupils classified the area as natural, based on \nscores of between 80 and 96 points. By visiting this well-\npreserved spring, the pupils were able to both develop a \nsense of responsibility, and better understand the conditions \nof the watercourses of this sub-basin as a whole.\n\nThe type of activity developed during the present \nstudy, which involved lecturers and students from different \ninstitutions, environmental protection agencies, and the \nlocal community, represents an efficient strategy for the \npractical application of the knowledge accrued in the \nclassroom, with major benefits for all parties involved.\n\nValidation of multi \u2013 and interdisciplinary experiences\nThe activities developed during the field course by \n\nthe 20 students from the two postgraduate programmes \nin ecology and conservation (UFMG and UFS), members \nof the local community, and personnel of the government \nenvironment agencies resulted in extensive interaction and \nthe exchange of multi \u2013 and inter-disciplinary experiences. \nThe study provided a preliminary evaluation of the \nenvironmental quality of the Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge, \napplying a rapid ecological assessment approach to the \ninvestigation of two sub-basins, and their aquatic habitats. \nThis initiative provided the first ecological parameters for \nthe basin of the Japaratuba river, as well as contributing \ntowards the development of local environmental education \nstrategies. The experience was further the basis of a series \nof recommendations for the development of public policies \nin the state, involving institutions such as UFS, EMBRAPA \n(Federal Agricultural Research Agency) and SEMARH.\n\nAcknowledgements \u2013 We sincerely thank the collaboration of \nthe managers of the Protected Area Mata do Junco, technicians \nof the Secretaria de Meio Ambiente e Recursos H\u00eddricos and to \nour local friends who kindly allowed the use of field facilities \nand provided extensive logistical advice and information on \nthe study area during the Field Course in March, 2010.
