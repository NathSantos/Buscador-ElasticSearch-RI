O interesse por este material n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas devido \u00e0s suas\nposs\u00edveis aplica\u00e7\u00f5es tecnol\u00f3gicas futuras, mas tamb\u00e9m porque oferece a possibilidade de\ninvestigar fen\u00f4menos interessantes previstos pelas teorias qu\u00e2nticas de campo, que v\u00e3o\n\ndesde o tunelamento de Klein e outros efeitos quasi-relativ\u00edsticos \u00e0 exist\u00eancia de novos\ntipos de graus de liberdade do el\u00e9tron, ou seja, o pseudo-spin, e a exist\u00eancia de dois vales\n\neletr\u00f4nicos n\u00e3o-equivalentes na vizinhan\u00e7a dos pontos sem gap do seu espectro de ener-\ngia. V\u00e1rias das propriedades ex\u00f3ticas observadas no grafeno originam-se do facto de que\n\ndentro da aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o de baixas energias para o Hamiltoniano tight-binding do grafeno,\nel\u00e9trons se comportam como f\u00e9rmions de Dirac sem massa, com uma dispers\u00e3o de energia\n\nlinear. Assim como no caso de uma monocamada de grafeno, o espectro eletr\u00f4nico de\nbaixas energias para uma bicamada de grafeno \u00e9 sem gap, mas, neste caso, \u00e9 dominado\n\npela dispers\u00e3o parab\u00f3lica. No entanto, uma caracter\u00edstica interessante \u00e9 compartilhada\npor ambas monocamada e bicamada de grafeno: o grau de liberdade de vale.\n\nNesta tese, n\u00f3s investigamos teoricamente: (i) as propriedades din\u00e2micas em mono e\nbicamadas de grafeno, realizando um estudo sistem\u00e1tico do espalhamento de pacotes de\nonda em diferentes formas de interfaces, bordas e potenciais; e, al\u00e9m disso, (ii) os n\u00edveis\n\nde energia de sistemas confinados no grafeno na presen\u00e7a ou aus\u00eancia de campos mag-\nn\u00e9ticos e el\u00e9tricos externos. Na primeira parte do trabalho, n\u00f3s utilizamos a abordagem\n\ntight-binding para estudar o espalhamento de um pacote de onda Gaussiano nas bordas\nde uma monocamada de grafeno (armchair e zigzag) na presen\u00e7a de campos magn\u00e9ticos\n\nreais e pseudo-magn\u00e9ticos (induzidos por tens\u00e3o) e tamb\u00e9m calculamos as probabilidades\nde transmiss\u00e3o de um pacote de onda Gaussiano atrav\u00e9s de um contato de ponto qu\u00e2ntico\n\ndefinido por potenciais eletrost\u00e1ticos em bicamadas de grafeno. Estes c\u00e1lculos num\u00e9ri-\ncos s\u00e3o baseados na solu\u00e7\u00e3o da equa\u00e7\u00e3o de Schr\u00f6dinger dependente do tempo para o\n\nHamiltoniano do modelo tight-binding, usando a t\u00e9cnica Split-operator. Nossa teoria per-\nmite investigar espalhamento no espa\u00e7o rec\u00edproco, e dependendo do tipo de borda do\ngrafeno, n\u00f3s observamos espalhamento dentro do mesmo vale, ou entre diferentes vales.\n\nNa presen\u00e7a de um campo magn\u00e9tico externo, as bem conhecidas \u00f3rbitas skipping orbits\ns\u00e3o observadas. No entanto, nossos resultados demonstram que, no caso de um campo\n\npseudo-magn\u00e9tico induzido por uma tens\u00e3o n\u00e3o-uniforme, o espalhamento por uma borba\narmchair resulta em um estado de borda n\u00e3o-propagante. N\u00f3s tamb\u00e9m propomos um sis-\n\ntema de filtragem de vales muito eficiente atrav\u00e9s de um sistema de contato de ponto\nqu\u00e2ntico definido por portas eletrost\u00e1ticas em uma bicamada de grafeno. Para o sistema\n\nde bicamadas sugerido, n\u00f3s investigamos a forma de melhorar a efici\u00eancia do sistema como\num filtro de vales por diferentes par\u00e2metros, como comprimento, largura e amplitude do\n\npotencial aplicado.\nNa segunda parte da tese, n\u00f3s apresentamos um estudo sistem\u00e1tico dos espectros de\n\n\n\nx\n\nenergia de an\u00e9is qu\u00e2nticos de grafeno com diferentes geometrias e tipos de borda, na\n\npresen\u00e7a de um campo magn\u00e9tico perpendicular. N\u00f3s discutimos quais caracter\u00edsticas\nobtidas por meio de um modelo simplificado de Dirac podem ser recuperadas quando os\n\nauto-estados de an\u00e9is qu\u00e2nticos de grafeno s\u00e3o comparados com os resultados do modelo\ntight-binding. Al\u00e9m disso, n\u00f3s tamb\u00e9m investigamos os estados confinados em dois sis-\n\ntemas h\u00edbridos diferentes de monocamada - bicamada, identificando estados localizados\ndentro do ponto e estados de borda para as estruturas de confinamento em bicamadas\n\nsugeridas, assim como vamos estudar o comportamento dos n\u00edveis de energia em fun\u00e7\u00e3o\ndo tamanho do ponto e sob um campo magn\u00e9tico externo aplicado. Finalmente, usando\n\no modelo cont\u00ednuo de Dirac de quatro bandas, n\u00f3s tamb\u00e9m derivamos uma express\u00e3o\ngeral para a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de contorno de massa infinita em bicamada de grafeno, a fim de\naplicar essa condi\u00e7\u00e3o de contorno para calcular analiticamente os estados confinados e as\n\ncorrespondentes fun\u00e7\u00f5es de onda em um ponto qu\u00e2ntico em uma bicamada de grafeno na\naus\u00eancia e na presen\u00e7a de um campo magn\u00e9tico perpendicular. Nossos resultados anal\u00edti-\n\ncos apresentam boa concord\u00e2ncia quando comparados com os resultados tight-binding.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nGraphene, a two-dimensional lattice of carbon atoms, has been widely studied during\n\nthe past few years. The interest in this material is not only due to its possible future\ntechnological applications, but also because it provides the possibility to probe interesting\nphenomena predicted by quantum field theories, ranging from Klein tunneling and other\n\nquasi-relativistic effects to the existence of new types of electron degrees of freedom,\nnamely, the pseudo-spin, and the existence of two inequivalent electronic valleys in the\n\nvicinity of the gapless points of its energy spectrum. Several of the exotic properties\nobserved in graphene originate from the fact that within the low energy approximation for\n\nthe tight-binding Hamiltonian of graphene, electrons behave as massless Dirac fermions,\nwith a linear energy dispersion. Just like in single layer graphene, the low-energy eletronic\n\nspectrum in bilayer graphene is gapless, but in this case it is dominated by the parabolic\ndispersion. Nevertheless, one interesting feature is shared by both monolayer and bilayer\n\ngraphene: the valley degree of freedom.\nIn this thesis, we theoretically investigate: (i) the dynamic properties in mono and\n\nbilayer graphene, performing a systematic study of wave packet scattering in different\ninterface shapes, edges and potentials; and furthermore (ii) the energy levels of confined\nsystems in graphene in the presence or absence of external magnetic and electric fields.\n\nIn the first part of the work, we use the tight-binding approach to study the scattering\nof a Gaussian wave packet on monolayer graphene edges (armchair and zigzag) in the\n\npresence of real and pseudo (strain induced) magnetic fields and also calculate the trans-\nmission probabilities of a Gaussian wave packet through a quantum point contact defined\n\nby electrostatic gates in bilayer graphene. These numerical calculations are based on the\nsolution of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the tight-binding model Hamilto-\n\nnian, using the Split-operator technique. Our theory allows us to investigate scattering in\nreciprocal space, and depending on the type of graphene edge we observe scattering within\n\nthe same valley, or between different valleys. In the presence of an external magnetic field,\nthe well known skipping orbits are observed. However, our results demonstrate that in\nthe case of a pseudo-magnetic field, induced by non-uniform strain, the scattering by an\n\narmchair edge results in a non-propagating edge state. We propose also a very efficient\nvalley filtering through a quantum point contact system defined by electrostatic gates in\n\nbilayer graphene. For the suggested bilayer system, we investigate how to improve the\nefficiency of the system as a valley filter by varying parameters, such as length, width and\n\namplitude of the applied potential.\nIn the second part of the thesis, we present a systematic study of the energy spectra\n\nof graphene quantum rings having different geometries and edge types, in the presence\nof a perpendicular magnetic field. We discuss which features obtained through a simpli-\n\nfied Dirac model can be recovered when the eigenstates of graphene quantum rings are\ncompared with the tight-binding results. Furthermore, we also investigate the confined\n\n\n\nxii\n\nstates in two different hybrid monolayer - bilayer systems, identifying dot-localized states\n\nand edge states for the suggested bilayer confinement structures, as well as we will study\nthe behavior of the energy levels as a function of dot size and under an applied external\n\nmagnetic field. Finally, using the four-band continuum Dirac model, we also derive a\ngeneral expression for the infinite-mass boundary condition in bilayer graphene in order\n\nto apply this boundary condition to calculate analytically the confined states and the\ncorresponding wave functions in a bilayer graphene quantum dot in the absence and pres-\n\nence of a perpendicular magnetic field. Our analytic results exhibit good agreement when\ncompared with the tight-binding ones.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nGrafeen, een twee-dimensionaal rooster van koolstof atomen, vormt de laatste jaren\n\neen zeer intens onderzoeksgebied. De interesse in dit materiaal is niet enkel dankzij zijn\nmogelijke technologische toepassingen, maar ook omdat het een mogelijkheid voorziet om\ninteressante nieuwe kwantum fenomenen te observeren. Dit gaande van Klein tunneling\n\nen andere quasirelativistische verschijnselen tot het bestaan ven nieuwe types van elektro-\nnische vrijheidsgraden, namelijk de pseusospin en het bestaan van twee niet equivalente\n\nelektronische valleien in de nabijheid van punten waarin het energiespectrum geen band-\nkloof heeft. Verschillende exotische eigenschappen in grafeen hebben hun oorsprong in\n\nhet feit dat binnen de lage energie benadering voor de \"tight-binding\" Hamiltoniaan van\ngrafeen de elektronen zich gedragen als massaloze Dirac fermionen en dus een lineaire\n\nenergie dispersie hebben. Net als in monolaag grafeen is het energiespectrum in bilaag\ngrafeen kloofloos, maar in dit geval heeft het een parabolische dispersie. Desalniettemin\n\ndelen deze twee materialen de vallei vrijheidsgraad.\nIn deze thesis onderzoeken we theoretische: (i) de dynamische eigenschappen in mono-\n\nen bilaag grafeen door een systematische studie uit te voeren van golfpakket verstrooi-\ning aan verschillende vormen van interface, rand en potentiaal; verder (ii) onderzoeken\nwe de energie niveaus van gebonden systemen in grafeen in de nabijheid of afwezigheid\n\nvan externe magnetische en elektrische velden. In he teerste deel van het werk gebruiken\nwe de thight-binding beschrijving om de verstrooing van een Gaussisch golfpakket aan\n\nmonolaag grafeen randen (zig-zag en \u201carmchair\u201d) te bestuderen in een echt en pseudo\n(vervorming geinduceerd) magneetveld en berekenen ook de transmissie waarschijnlijkhe-\n\nden van een Gaussisch golfpakket door een kwantum punt contact bepaald door elektro-\nstatische poorten in bilaag grafeen. Deze numerieke berekeningen zijn gebaseerd op de\n\noplossingen van de tijdsafhankelijke Schrodinger vergelijking voor de tight-binding model\nHamiltoniaan gebruikmakend van de split-operator techniek.onze theorie laat ons toe om\n\nde verstrooiing te bestuderen in reciproke ruimte. Afhankelijk van het type grafeen rand\nobserveren we verstrooiing binnen dezelfde vallei of tussen verschillende valleien. In de\nnabijheid van een extern magneetveld zien we de welbekende springende cirkelbanen.\n\nOnze resultaten tonen echter dat in het geval dat een pseudomagneet veld geinduceerd\nwordt door niet uniforme vervorming, de verstrooiing bij een armchair rand resulteert\n\nin een niet propagerende randtoestand. We stellen ook een zeer effici\u00ebnte vallei filter\ndoor een kwantum punt contact gevormd door een elektrostatische poort voor in bilaag\n\ngrafeen. Voor dit bilaag systeem onderzoeken we hoe de efficiency van het systeem als\nvalleifilter kan worden geoptimaliseerd door verschillende parameters te varieren zoals de\n\nlengte, breedte of amplitude van de aangelegde potentiaal.\nIn het tweede deel van de thesis stellen we een systematische studie voor van de energie\n\nspectra van grafeen kwantumringen met verschillende geometrien en rand types voor in\nde nabijheid van een loodrecht magneetveld. We bespreken welke eigenschappen verk-\n\n\n\nxiv\n\nlaard kunnen worden door middel van een vereenvoudigd Dirac model kunnen worden\n\nverklaard wanneer de eigentoestanden van de grafeen kwantum ring vergeleken worden et\nde tight-binding resultaten. Verder onderzoeken we ook de gebonden toestanden in twee\n\nverschillende hybride monolaag-bilaag systemen en identificeren we puntgelocaliseerde\ntoestanden en randtoestanden voor de voorgestelde bilaag gebonden structuren. Daaren-\n\nboven bespreken we het gedrag van de energieniveaus als functie van de grootte van\nhet punt en onder een extern magneetveld. Ten slotte leiden we ook een algemene uit-\n\ndrukking af voor de oneindige massa randvoorwaarde in bilaag grafeen om de gebonden\ntoestanden en de overeenstemmende eigentoestanden analytisch te kunnen berekenen in\n\nde vierbandshamiltoniaan van het bilaag grafeen kwantum punt. Dit doen we met en\nzonder een extern magneetveld. Onze analytische resultaten stemmen goed overeen met\nde numerieke resultaten die we verkregen via thight-binding.\n\n\n\nContents\n\nList of Figures xviii\n\nList of Tables xxx\n\nList of

Initially,\nwe will expose a brief history of obtaining isolated graphene, talking about the reasons\n\nfor delay in making this \u201cdiscovery\u201d. We also discuss the different allotropes of carbon\nand the hybridizations that generate them. We will relate the physical properties, such\n\nas dimensionality, with its crystalline forms and its hybridizations. Finally, we present\nthree ways of obtaining few-layer graphene (FLG).\n\n1.1 A brief history: carbon materials\n\nDuring the last twenty years, the scientific community has focused its attention to\n\nresearch involving nanomaterials, especially for the study and exploration of properties of\nthose materials consisting only of carbon atoms, among which is graphene1.\n\nAlthough some of the allotropes of carbon are known for many years, such as diamond\nand graphite2, the invention/isolation of graphene, even being considered the mother of\n\nall these different forms, was somehow very delayed. The reasons are due to the fact\nthat (i) studies of two-dimensional crystal structures have been guided by the idea that\n\nsuch atomic arrangements would be thermodynamically unstable at finite temperatures,\nand that (ii) there could be some graphene among the pencil debris, but there were no\n\nexperimental tools to search for one-atom-thick flakes there[1].\nThe idea that two-dimensional atomic crystals do not exist and are thermodynamically\n\nunstable under ambient conditions is based on the physical theory of Peierls, Landau, Lif-\nshitz and Mermin [3, 4, 5, 6], which states that thermal fluctuations existing at any finite\ntemperature should make the low dimensional crystal lattices undergo atomic displace-\n\nments comparable to interatomic distances such that this lattice would collapse. This\n\n1Graphene is the name given to a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with carbon rings formed\nby six carbon atoms, which extend infinitely in the 2D plane.\n\n2Graphite has been know as a mineral for nearly 500 years and has been used in a pencil for at least\n440 years [1, 2].\n\n\n\n1.1. A BRIEF HISTORY: CARBON MATERIALS 35\n\nstatement is described in Mermin-Wagner theorem [6, 7]. Since the conventional methods\n\nto synthesize crystal growth heretofore developed and used (before the graphene isolation)\nwere all based on temperature variations, and coupled with the Mermin-Wagner theorem,\n\nsuch a synthesis was not feasible. Furthermore, it is known that the melting temperature\nof a thin film decreases with its thickness. Thus, when some graphite layers are subjected\n\nto high temperatures, it results in the formation of islands or in the decomposition of\nthe film, making it unstable. This led to the idea that the two-dimensional crystal lat-\n\ntices could only exist as part of a three-dimensional system or on top of non-crystalline\nsubstrates [8].\n\nHowever, the discovery of new carbon allotropes in the last thirty years made reemerge\nthe interest in carbon materials. First, the fullerenes were discovered in 1985 by a team\nfrom Rice University and University of Sussex, composed by R. F. Curl, H. W. Kroto\n\nand R. E. Smalley [9], who were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1996 \u201cfor their\ndiscovery of fullerenes\u201d [10]. And latter, in 1991 it is attributed to S. Iijima the discovery\n\nof carbon nanotubes, where in his publication S. Iijima reported about multi-wall carbon\nnanotubes (MWNTs) [11]. Two years latter in 1993, a single-wall carbon nanotubes\n\n(SWNTs) was observed simultaneously by S. Iijima and D. S. Bethune and published in\nthe same issue of Nature [12, 13]. These discoveries have opened new perspectives for\n\ninnovations in the electronics industry based on carbon.\nUntil then, graphene was considered only as a \u201cphysics toy\u201d [2] and an \u201cacademic\n\nmaterial\u201d [8]. Its theory was developed by P. R. Wallace in 1947 [14], who explained\nhow the band structure of graphene is and showed the unusual semimetallic behavior in\n\nthis material even before it was found experimentally. This theory is used for describing\nproperties of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes and it is one of the reasons that graphene\nis considered the mother of carbon materials.\n\nAfter many experimental attempts of various research groups in condensed matter to\nobtain graphene, in 2004, a group of physicists from Manchester University (UK) led by\n\nAndre Geim and Kostya Novoselov finally succeeded in isolating films consisting of few\nlayers of graphene. This study by Geim\u2019s group began in 2002/2003. The initial goal was\n\nto obtain around 100-layer graphite and to study it with the hope of finding problems\nsimilar to those in the carbon nanotube world [15]. This search to make graphite films\n\nas thin as possible was part of the experiments performed by Geim and his collaborators\nonly for fun, without any strict commitment with the quality of results. They devoted ten\n\npercent of their time to so-called \u201cFriday evening\u201d experiments and the graphene business\nstarted as one of these Fridays [16]. In the experimental process to obtain thin films of\ngraphite, they employed a widely used procedure for the surface cleaning of graphite for\n\nanalysis in scanning tunneling microscope (STM), which consists only in sticking ordinary\nadhesive tape in the graphite and then pull it, repeating this operation several times. At\n\nthe end, very thin flakes are left attached to the tape. After this stage, the researchers\nneeded to deposit the resulting thin films on a particular substrate previously unknown\n\n\n\n1.1. A BRIEF HISTORY: CARBON MATERIALS 36\n\nto analyze the films on tape. Luckily, they deposited on an oxidized silicon substrate\n\n(Si/SiO2) (the only available substrate in the initial week of testing), and thus one could\nnotice that some films had only one layer [17]. Thus, in 2004, it was announced by\nGeim and Novoselov the formal obtainment/\u201cdiscovery\u201d of graphene in an isolated and\n\nstable form at room temperature3 [18], and in 2010 they were already awarded the Nobel\nPrize in Physics \u201cfor groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material\n\ngraphene\u201d [19].\n\nFigure 1.1: Ingredients to find out graphene: two good researchers, scotch tape and\n\ngraphite. Photographs taken when Geim and Novoselov were attending the 2010 Nobel\nPrize ceremony (December 8, 2010) at Aula Magna, Stockholm University.\n\nThe following years after the discovery of graphene were marked by numerous publi-\ncations that have consolidated this 2D nanomaterial in the scenario of scientific research.\n\nThis hot topic has received a lot of attention from the science community [20] due to its\nimportance in basic science [21, 22] and its unique electronic properties, which make it\nan excellent and promising option for the industry to create new devices such as simple\n\nmolecular gas sensor, ballistic transistors and spintronic devices [8, 23]. The atypical\nproperties of charge carriers in graphene are due to its linear dispersion relation at low\n\nenergies (E &lt;1eV). Displaying a gapless energy spectrum with a conic format [21], the\nlow-energy electrons behave like zero-mass relativistic particles with an effective velocity\n\nof the order of 106 m/s. Thus, the motion of these charge carriers is governed by the\nmassless Dirac fermions equation, which leads to several interesting phenomena such as,\n\nfor example, ambipolar electric field effect, minimum conductivity, anomalous quantum\nHall effect and Klein tunneling [1, 24].\n\nThese results stated the existence of thermodynamically stable two-dimensional crys-\ntals, i. e., the few layers of graphene isolated, and with the improvement in experimental\n\n3In fact, what Geim\u2019s group found was still graphite, about 10-layers thick [15].\n\n\n\n1.2. THE CARBON ATOM AND ITS HYBRIDIZATIONS 37\n\ntechniques in the last years, they opened the doors to study other 2D atomic crystals,\n\nsuch as molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) [25]. Thus,\nit is possible that the research area in 2D crystals remains as a hot topic for many years,\njust like the semiconductor physics is still widely studied until today.\n\n1.2 The carbon atom and its hybridizations\n\nCarbon, an unique chemical element, composes the elementary building block of all\norganic molecules. In this way, it is also responsible for life on Earth, as well as constitutes\nplenty of inorganic materials. This element is the fourth most abundant chemical element\n\nin the universe by mass, losing only to hydrogen, helium, and oxygen, being abundant in\nthe Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmosphere of most planets.\n\nThe carbon atom is a member of group 14 and the sixth element on the periodic\ntable, neighbor to Boron and Nitrogen. Its atom has six electrons distributed in the\n\nground state according the configuration 1s22s22p2. The 1s orbital is occupied by two\nelectrons strongly bound to the nucleus, such that they are irrelevant for chemical bounds.\n\nThese electrons, together with the nucleus, are called the core of the atom. On the other\nhand, the other four electrons, the so-called valence electrons that occupy the 2s and\n\n2p orbitals, are more weakly bound. Therefore, they have an effective participation in\nchemical reactions. Since carbon has two half-filled orbitals, valence electrons open the\n\npossibility to form at least two bonds with other atoms.\nLet us start from the context of the hydrogen-like atom to understand how the wave\n\nfunction is written for multi-electronic atoms. It is known that the eigenfunctions for\n\nthe hydrogen-like atom are called atomic orbitals, where the state corresponding to each\norbital is described as |nlm?, or, in spectroscopic notation, as |nxm?, with x = s, p, d, f,\ng, h... related to l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5..., respectively, and ?l ? m ? l. These eigenfunctions\n|nlm? (or ?nlm) are given in terms of the product of spherical harmonics Y ml (?,?) and a\nfunction F(r) that depends on the radial direction, related to the central potential Vc(r).\nSince only orbitals s and p are considered in the carbon atom interactions, corresponding\n\nto l values equal to 0 and 1, then the Y ml (?,?) functions concerned are\n\nY 00 (?,?) =\n1\n\n2\n?\n?\n, (1.1a)\n\nY \u00b111 (?,?) =\n?1\n2\n\n?\n3\n\n2?\nsin ?e\u00b1i?, (1.1b)\n\nY 01 (?,?) =\n1\n\n2\n\n?\n3\n\n?\ncos?, (1.1c)\n\nshowing that the wave function for the s orbital is always real and has a spherical shape,\nsince Y 00 is constant. For p states that carry complex values in the |nlm? basis, it is\n\n\n\n1.2. THE CARBON ATOM AND ITS HYBRIDIZATIONS 38\n\nconvenient to make a transformation in order to obtain always orbitals that assume real\n\nvalues. Using the linear combination of the states with m = \u00b11 we have\n\n|npx? =\n1?\n2\n\n(\n|np1\n\n?\n? |np?1\n\n?)\n, (1.2a)\n\n|npy? =\n1\n\ni\n?\n2\n\n(\n|np1\n\n?\n+ |np?1\n\n?)\n, (1.2b)\n\n|npz? = |np0\n?\n. (1.2c)\n\nThese p orbitals are plotted in Figs. 1.3, 1.5 and 1.7, and have the shape of two spheres\ntouching each other forming a dumbbell. The colors blue and orange represent, respec-\n\ntively, the positive and negative signs of the wave function4.\nAlthough the inclusion of electron-electron interactions makes it impossible to have\n\nthe exact solution for multi-electron atoms, we can still extend the concept of orbital for\nan approximation of independent electrons to many-electron atoms. Thus, we use the\n\nconcept of orbitals of hydrogen-like atoms to describe the bounds between many-electron\natoms.\n\nDespite the 2s orbital to be approximately 4 eV less energetic than the 2p orbitals,\nthis energy difference is smaller as compared to the binding energies involving the carbon\n\natom. Thus, for the ground state, it is more energetically favorable to keep two electrons\nin the 2s orbital and two in the 2p orbitals, whereas in the presence of other atoms it is\nfavorable to promote one of the two electrons in 2s orbital to the third 2p orbital, that\n\nwas previously empty, as shown in Figs. 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 on excited states. Therefore, one\nhas, after the process of electron promotion, four half-filled orbitals that can easily form\n\ncovalent bonds with the linear combination of states |2s?, |2px?, |2py? and |2pz?. This\nmixing of the state |2s? and n states |2pj?, with j = 1, 2 and 3, that enhances the binding\nenergy between the carbon and its neighboring atoms, is called hybridization, where the\nsuperposition of a single 2s electron with n 2p electrons is named as spn hybridization\n\n[27].\nWe are now going to describe how the three types of hybridization happen on carbon,\n\nshowing which states get into to form the hybrid orbitals sp, sp2 and sp3. 5\n\n1.2.1 sp hybridization\n\nIn the process of sp hybridization, after the promotion of one electron to 2p orbital,\n\nas we can see in Fig. 1.2, the 2s orbital and one of the 2p orbitals, 2px for example, are\n4The orbital figures were made using the Orbital Viewer program, available for free in [26].\n5There are other kind of hybridization involving more energetic orbitals with other atoms, for example\n\nsp3d hybridization, that composes the bounds in PF5, SF4 and BrF3 molecules, exhibiting a triangular\n\nbipyramidal shape, and sp3d2 hybridization, that composes the bounds in SF6, ClF5 and XeF4 molecules,\nexhibit an octahedral shape [28].\n\n\n\n1.2. THE CARBON ATOM AND ITS HYBRIDIZATIONS 39\n\ncombined. This mixing results in two 2sp hybridized orbitals and two 2p non-hybridized\n\norbitals. From this linear combination between |2s? and |2px? orbitals, arise two hybrids\nstates\n\n|spa? = C1 |2s? + C2 |2px? , (1.3a)\n\n|spb? = C3 |2s? + C4 |2px? , (1.3b)\n\nthat obey the orthonormality conditions\n\n?spa|spa? = ?spb|spb? = 1, (1.4a)\n\n?spa|spb? = ?spb|spa? = 0.

The other two p pure orbitals not hybridized\nare perpendicular to the axis that passes through the chain and are responsible to form\n\n? bonds. An example of structure formed by carbon that presents this sp hybridization\nis the acetylene (HC CH). This molecule is linear and has a triple bond between its\ntwo carbon atoms, which corresponds to a stronger ? bond and two additional ? bonds,\n\nwhich are weaker than the former.\n\n1.2.2 sp2 hybridization\n\nNow, the mixing of orbitals involves the 2s orbital and two 2p orbitals, for example 2px\nand 2py orbitals, as schematically represented in Fig. 1.4. This process is responsible for\n\nthe emergence of orbitals propitious to three identical and coplanar connections equally\nspaced, making a 1200 angle with each carbon atom. Mathematically, the origin of the\n\nthree hybrid states can be written as a linear combination of |2s?, |2px? and |2py? orbitals,\nsuch as\n\n|sp2a\n?\n= C1 |2s? + C2 |2px? + C3 |2py? , (1.7a)\n\n|sp2b\n?\n= C4 |2s? + C5 |2px? + C6 |2py? , (1.7b)\n\n|sp2c\n?\n= C7 |2s? + C8 |2px? + C9 |2py? . (1.7c)\n\nGiven the fact that the sp2 hybridization gives rise to three identical bonds in xy-plane,\n\nthat the 2s orbital is also symmetrically spherical and that the probability of being occu-\npied should be 1 in |sp2a?, |sp2b? and |sp2c? hybrid states, one has C21 +C24 +C27 = 1, leading\n\n\n\n1.2. THE CARBON ATOM AND ITS HYBRIDIZATIONS 41\n\nto C1 = C4 = C7 = C. In addition to these facts, in order to find the other Ci\u2019s constant\n\nvalues, we have that only 2p orbitals are relevant to define the preferential direction of\nhybrid states and that these directions of the orbitals are (0, ?1, 0), (\n\n?\n3/2, 1/2, 0) and\n\n(?\n?\n3/2, 1/2, 0), which implies that\n\n|sp2a\n?\n= C |2s? +\n\n?\n1 ? C2 [? |2py?] , (1.8a)\n\n|sp2b\n?\n= C |2s? +\n\n?\n1 ? C2\n\n[?\n3\n\n2\n|2px? +\n\n1\n\n2\n|2py?\n\n]\n, (1.8b)\n\n|sp2c\n?\n= C |2s? +\n\n?\n1 ? C2\n\n[\n?\n?\n3\n\n2\n|2px? +\n\n1\n\n2\n|2py?\n\n]\n. (1.8c)\n\nSimilarly to what was done to the sp hybridization (Eqs. (1.4a) and (1.4b)), we are\ngoing to use the orthonormality conditions to find C: using the fact that\n\n?\nsp2i |sp2j\n\n?\n= ?ij,\n\nwe have C = 1/\n?\n3. Consequently, Eqs. (1.8a)-(1.8c) become\n\n|sp2a\n?\n=\n\n1?\n3\n|2s? ?\n\n?\n2\n\n3\n|2py? , (1.9a)\n\n|sp2b\n?\n=\n\n1?\n3\n|2s? + 1?\n\n2\n|2px? +\n\n1?\n6\n|2py? , (1.9b)\n\n|sp2c\n?\n=\n\n1?\n3\n|2s? ? 1?\n\n2\n|2px? +\n\n1?\n6\n|2py? , (1.9c)\n\nwhere the sum to form the hybrid orbitals is shown in Fig. 1.5. Only the lobes part are\n\npresented in |sp2? state.\nTherefore, the three equivalent sp2 orbitals will arrange themselves in a trigonal planar\n\nconfiguration, oriented in the xy-plane. The remaining non-hybridized 2pz orbital is\nperpendicular to the plane. Such hybridization occurs in graphite, graphene and in chains\n\nof polyacetylene, for example the ethylene (H2C CH2) [27, 28].\n\n1.2.3 sp3 hybridization\n\nWhen one superposes the 2s and all three 2p orbitals, this mixing provides the sp3\n\nhybridization (see Fig. 1.6 to understand how this happens). It forms four identical bonds\nsymmetrically distributed in space and placed with the maximum separation possible, i.\n\ne. making a 109028? angle between each bonding and resulting in a tetrahedral shape for\nthe molecule.\n\n\n\n1.2.

THE CARBON ATOM AND ITS HYBRIDIZATIONS 43\n\nAnalogously to previous cases, we can write the four hybrid states as a linear combi-\n\nnation of |2s?, |2px?, |2py? and |2pz? orbitals\n\n|sp3a\n?\n= C1 |2s? + C2 |2px? + C3 |2py? + C4 |2pz? , (1.10a)\n\n|sp3b\n?\n= C5 |2s? + C6 |2px? + C7 |2py? + C8 |2pz? , (1.10b)\n\n|sp3c\n?\n= C9 |2s? + C10 |2px? + C11 |2py? + C12 |2pz? , (1.10c)\n\n|sp3d\n?\n= C13 |2s? + C14 |2px? + C15 |2py? + C16 |2pz? . (1.10d)\n\nAs each |sp3i ? orbital, with i = a, b, c and d, is aligned to the axes of tetrahedron, then\nwe can build the four orbitals along the (1, 1, 1), (?1, ?1, 1), (?1, 1, ?1) and (1, ?1, 1)\ndirections. From this, we obtain a set of equations similar to Eqs. (1.8a)-(1.8c)\n\n|sp3a\n?\n= C |2s? + (\n\n?\n1 ? C2) 1?\n\n3\n[|2px? + |2py? + |2pz?] , (1.11a)\n\n|sp3b\n?\n= C |2s? + (\n\n?\n1 ?

The different hybridizations give\nrise to a plethora of organic and inorganic compounds, forming an unlimited number\n\nof structures with a wide variety of physical and chemical properties. Most of these\nproperties are crucial to determine the dimensionality of the structures. Table 1.2 shows\n\nsome relatively well-known allotropes of carbon and a couple of their features, for example,\ntheir dimensionality, that varies from 0D to 3D. From Table 1.2, one can see that the\ncarbon material which has a n dimensionality will have a spn hybridization type.\n\nTable 1.2: Allotropes made of carbon [27].\nDimension 0D 1D 2D 3D\n\nAllotrope Fullerene, Nanotube, Graphite, Diamond,\n\nC60 Carbyne Fiber,Graphene Amorphous\nHybridization sp2 sp2 (sp) sp2 sp3\n\nDensity (g/cm3) 1.72 1.2 ? 2.0 2.26 3.52\nBond Length (\u00c5 ) 1.40 (C C) 1.44 (C C) 1.42 (C C) 1.54 (C C)\n\n1.46 (C C)\nElectronic Properties Semiconductor Semiconductor Semimetal Insulating\n\nEg = 1.9 eV or Metal Eg = 5.47 eV\n\nLet us now comment these structures.

The\nidea is taken from Refs. [7] and [29].\n\nThe graphite is formed by carbon sheets that are stacked, bonded through weak van\nder Waals forces (Fig. 1.8 (c)). The adjacent surfaces interact with each other through\n\nthe ? electrons that populate the 2pz orbital perpendicular to sheet planes. These bonds\nare weaker than the covalent ? bonds in plane. The atoms in each sheet are disposed in a\n\nhexagonal network, such as each atom is bonded trigonally to three others, presenting a\nsp2 hybridization. The distance (C C) in each sheet is 1.42 \u00c5, while the displacement\nbetween the layers is of 3.33 \u00c5 . Due to the weak interplanar conections between the\n\nlayers, graphite plans can move easily over each other forming a good solid lubricant and\nmaking such material to behave like a 2D material. Although this topic will be still\n\nexplained further in more details when we discuss about graphene (Fig. 1.8 (d)), which is\nthe allotrope of interest in the following Chapters, we can already mention that graphene\n\nis a single graphite sheet, arranged as a honeycomb lattice of atoms. Each carbon atom\n\n\n\n1.4. FABRICATION TECHNIQUES 47\n\nin this structure has a sp2 hybridization and is very strongly bound through ? bonds with\n\nthree other neighboring atoms. The ? electrons in half-filled 2pz orbital are responsible\nfor the unusual electronic transport properties in graphene [30].\n\nThe diamond (Fig. 1.8 (a)), that is rather wished by many people, together with\n\ngraphite are the two allotropic forms that historically have been the most popular. Under\nhigh pressure, carbon forms diamond, that is the most compact carbon allotrope. Its\n\n3D lattice consists of two interpenetrating face-center-cubic (fcc) lattices, such as each\natom is bonded to four others nearest neighbors, forming a tetrahedron that possess a\n\nsp3 hybridization. The lattice spacing in (C C) links are of 1.54 \u00c5 . Diamond is the\nhardest mineral in nature, because all four bonds are covalent ? bonds. This fact is the\n\nreason for diamond to be an insulator with a large gap of 5.47 eV [31]. Counter intuitively,\nthe diamond is thermodynamically unstable under normal conditions and when exposed\n\nto some perturbations it transforms back into graphite, but at room temperature this\nprocess is extremely slow [27].\n\nAnother allotropic form of carbon is the fullerene (Fig. 1.8 (f)-(i)). In this structure,\n\ncarbon atoms are packed in a spherical or oval surface, forming hexagons and pentagons or\neven heptagons of carbons. These latter are responsible for the curvature of the structure\n\nin spheroid shapes. The fullerenes are large molecules in which carbon atoms are bonded\ntrigonally and possess a sp2 hybridization. The best-known fullerene is the soccerball-\n\nshaped C60 buckminnsterfullerene, that has twelve pentagons and twenty hexagons and\nis also called buckyball. It has the same symmetry of a regular icosahedron and it forms\n\na 0D system in confinement sense [9].\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one dimensional structures that can be understood as\n\na curved graphene sheet forming a hollow cylinder with a diameter of several nanometers,\ndepending on the number of walls (see Fig. 1.8 (e)).\n\n1.4 Fabrication techniques\n\nSince the 1960\u2019s, many researchers have done many attempts to obtain a single isolated\n\nsheet of graphite. Although they have failed, the techniques used in such attempts have\ngained new perspectives with Geim and Novoselov results [18], which boosted the search\n\nfor other new methods of synthesis of graphene and the improvement of existing tech-\nniques, aiming the development of very effective and inexpensive methods of graphene\n\nproduction on a large industrial scale. In this way, even though this is a theoretical\nthesis, it is important to discuss, in general lines, about the most commonly employed\n\ngrowth/deposition methods used to obtain graphene: exfoliation from graphite, epitaxial\ngrowth on silicon carbide (SiC) and catalytic growth on metal by chemical vapor deposi-\n\ntion (CVD).\n\n\n\n1.4. FABRICATION TECHNIQUES 48\n\n1.4.1 Exfoliation from graphite\n\nAlthough there are two kinds of exfoliation techniques, namely, mechanical and chem-\nical6 exfoliation, both are based in the same principle, that consists in breaking down the\n\nVan der Waals forces between the graphite layers.\nMechanical exfoliation was developed first, hence, it is the most popular method for\n\nproducing graphene. Its procedure has two main steps: \u201cpeeling\u201d and \u201crubbing\u201d. In the\nfirst step, one starts with highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), which is sandwiched\n\nbetween adhesive tapes to peel off layers from a graphite flake. This is done successively,\nso that in each time the graphite is sliced into two parts, and each part is thinner than\nthe original one. After several cycles, the second step is performed, when the tape is\n\npressed down against a substrate, formed by silicon oxide (SiO2), to deposit a sample.\nThis process is very similar to what happens when we write with a pencil, except for the\n\nlevel of purity of the used graphite. Due to the use of tapes, this technique is also called\n\u201cscotch-tape\u201d method. As the inter-layer Van der Waals interaction energy is of about 2\n\neV/nm2, then the order of magnitude of the force required to exfoliate graphite is about\n300 nN/\u00b5m2 [33].\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 1.9: (a) Graphite flakes on adhesive tape to isolate graphene through scotch-tap\nmethod. (b) and (c) are optical images of few-layer graphene obtained by micromechanical\n\nexfoliation from graphite. In (b) one has thin graphite and (c) FLG and a single layer\ngraphene shown in lighter purple contrast on a ? 300nm SiO2 layer. The colors are related\nwith local thickness of the sample. Yellowish color indicates thicker samples while bluish\nand lighter contrast indicates thinner samples. Adapted from Refs. [33] and [34].\n\nThe graphene produced by this method has a perfect crystallinity and a high electrical\nquality, once that this process is performed with a single crystalline graphite source and\n\ndoes not undergo any intrusive procedure or equipment. However, the produced flakes\nreach only 100 \u00b5m2 [2] and are obtained in the wafer form isolated or mixed with few-\n\nlayer graphene, which does not allow its application on a large scale. Thus, graphene\n\n6This technique was widely used in the 70\u2019s and consists of reducing the Van der Waals forces between\n\nthe atomic planes of graphite by inserting chemical species between the planes in order to expand the\n\nbonds. For more details, see Refs. [2] and [32].\n\n\n\n1.4. FABRICATION TECHNIQUES 49\n\nsynthesized by mechanical exfoliation is suitable only for basic research and demonstration\n\ndevices.\nAs the resulting flakes are composed by a mixing of FLG, then to visualize single flakes,\n\npeeled HOPG should be placed on 300 nm thick SiO2 to enhance the optical contrast under\n\nwhite light illumination in a optical microscope. Fig. 1.9 shows a sample of thin films\nof graphite, where the different colors are related to the number of graphene layers. The\n\nSiO2 substrate with a thickness of 300 nm has a violet coloration when observed by optical\nmicroscope. With the increasing in thickness due to FLG presence, one can observe a\n\nchange in color to blue in the region where the films are located. The thinner the films\nare, more tenuous is the change in coloration, until films with a thickness smaller than\n\n1.5 nm are no longer visible by this method.\n\n1.4.2 Epitaxial growth on SiC\n\nEven before the isolation of a single layer of graphite, it was known since the 70\u2019s\n\nthat layers of graphene could be grown epitaxially on solid substrates using thermal\ndecomposition of carbides [1, 33]. The most popular epitaxial process uses a silicon\ncarbide substrate. In fact this experimental method is actually a hybrid epitaxial and\n\nthermal decomposition process of a crystal of SiC at high temperature.\nThe thermal treatment consists in the sublimation of the silicon atoms at the top of the\n\ncrystal, that are desorbed, leaving a carbon-enriched surface. As the silicon atoms are sub-\nlimated, the remaining carbon atoms reorganize themselves forming graphitic structures.\n\nThis stage is also called \u201cgraphitization\u201d. This epitaxial growth requires temperatures\naround 13000C and ultra high vacuum [35].\n\nThe number of layers and the physical properties of these graphitic layers are con-\ntrolled parameters in this growth technique. The accuracy in the number of layers can\n\nbe controlled by the growth time or by the temperature used in the heating treatment,\nwhile the quality of the samples depends on the chosen SiC surface used for their growth.\n\nThere are two surface terminations: Si-terminated surface (0001) and C-terminated sur-\nface (0001). In the case of C-terminated surface, the graphitization process is slow, so that\none may control more accurately how many layers are formed, and thus produce fewer\n\nlayers. The resulting electron mobility is rather low in such a way that this kind of surface\norientation is less chosen for samples used in transport measurements. On the other hand,\n\nthe epitaxial-thermal process using Si-terminated surface is very fast, producing a large\nnumber of graphene layers. In this last termination, the electron mobility is rather high\n\n[1, 35]. This formation process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.10, using Si- and\nC-terminated surfaces.\n\nAn important point in this synthesis is that the SiC substrate must be considered as\nan integral part of whole system. This implies that the electronic properties can change\n\nalong the sample, indicating a certain degree of inhomogeneity after graphene growth.\nThe interaction between substrate and the obtained FLG is stronger at the first graphite\n\n\n\n1.4.

It is so tightly bound to the SiC substrate that the distance of the first carbon layer\n\ndirectly on top of the substrate (? 2 \u00c5 ) is smaller than the distance between graphene\nsheets in crystalline graphite (? 3.4 \u00c5 ), whereas the distance between the above layers\nare bigger than the ones in crystalline graphite [37]. Furthermore, the graphene layers\nproduced in this experimental method are heavily doped, due to the charge transfer from\n\nthe substrate to graphene layers, leading the sample to exhibit a metallic character [1].\nThis excess of charges due to electronic doping moves the Fermi level away from the\n\ngraphene Dirac point, therefore changing the graphene properties [38].\n\n1.4.3 Chemical vapor deposition\n\nAnother well-known possibility of synthesizing graphene on a substrate is by means of\nthe method called Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). This technique has many advan-\n\ntages that made it becomes the most promising method for the production of graphene\non a large scale. Some of these advantages can be listed, as for example: the possibility\n\nof synthesizing thin films of graphene with high uniformity, the fact that it can be trans-\nferred easily to other substrates, the relatively low cost and the rapidity and simplicity of\n\nthe process [33, 39, 40].\nThe process of graphene synthesis using CVD involves sputtering of an initial thin\n\nmetal film. It happens by the exposure of the transition metals to a carbon rich atmo-\nsphere at high temperatures. In general, this gaseous flow of hydrocarbons is composed\n\nby methane (CH4) or ethyne (C2H2). The gas molecules are deposited on the substrate,\n\n\n\n1.4. FABRICATION TECHNIQUES 51\n\nusually a Si/SiO2 wafer, on which a thin film of transition metal is deposited. The tran-\n\nsition metal acts as a catalyst, thermally decomposing the molecules and providing the\nnecessary conditions for the formation of graphitic structures on the substrate surface.\nThe solubilization of carbon in the thin film after the thermal decomposition of hydro-\n\ncarbons gases occurs due to the fact that transition metals have specific characteristics\nof melting and boiling points, along with the fact that these transition metals have a\n\ngreat number of half-filled electronic orbitals which facilitate the breaking of the molec-\nular bonds, since in the catalyzation process, a compound interacts with the metal by\n\nelectrons donating such as the anti-bonding orbitals are populated, assisting the breaking\nof the bonds. Thus, after heating and exposing stages, the sample is subjected to cooling\n\nstage. It is during cool-down that the solubility of the carbon in the metal decreases,\nresulting in crystallization of graphene on the surface [32, 41].\n\nLow density\n\nHigh density\n\n(b) (c)\n\n(d)\n\n(a)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nFigure 1.11: (a) Graphene growth process using a Ni film and its different stages (1-3):\n1.

The most investigated ones are those involving\ngrowth with nickel and copper as catalysts. As an example of CVD synthesis employing\none of these most used transition metals, the growth cycle using thin films of nickel is\n\nschematically illustrated in Fig. 1.11.\nAs we can see in Fig 1.11(f), with this technique, one can cover an entire wafer with\n\ngraphene. However, these films (Figs. 1.11(b)-1.11(d)) can not be used directly in elec-\ntronic applications, due to the conducting substrate. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer\n\nthem to a substrate like SiO2/Si (Figs. 1.11(c)-1.11(e)) [41, 42].\nIn summary, all these three presented techniques have each one their specificities.\n\nThus, depending on the desired application, one may choose one or another technique\nwhich may be more attractive.

APPLICATIONS 53\n\nthe previous section [49], as well as an exceptional material to replace all the devices and\n\ntechnology based on silicon [50]. According to Andre Geim, as reported in the BBC news\n[51] on May 21th 2011, he said that \u201cGraphene does not just have one application\u201d and also\nin the same issue of this journal Jari Kinaret, professor of technology at Chalmers Univer-\n\nsity in Sweden, mentioned that \u201cIt can open completely new applications in transparent\nelectronics, in flexible electronics and electronics that are much faster than today\u201d. Thus,\n\ngraphene and its derivatives offer the promise to significantly improve existing products\nand to enable the design of materials and devices with novel functionalities. We will men-\n\ntion here a few examples of graphene materials and devices. Some of these applications\nthey are in a more mature stage, in the sense that are closer to be implemented in the list\n\nof commercial devices, while the other ones in different areas are in a more conceptual\nstage.\n\n1.5.1 Flexible graphene for displays\n\nGraphene has emerged as an ideal candidate for transparent and flexible electrodes.\nThis is one of the most practical applications for graphene in electronics, which is based\non three important properties, two optical and one mechanical: (i) graphene can be\n\nused as a very thin transparent conducting film, (ii) it presents low resistivity [52] and, in\naddition, (iii) it has the smallest bending radius among all flexible transparent conductors\n\ncharacterized so far [53] (see Figs. 1.12(a) and 1.12(b)). It has been also shown that plastic\ncan become conductive by adding only 1% of graphene while it will remain transparent\n\nand that graphene is highly transparent even for the visual spectrum [52, 54] (see Fig.\n1.12(c)). In this way, transparent conducting films based on graphene can be used in\n\nmany applications such as touchscreen, smart windows, mobile phones, TVs, solar cells,\nLight Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs), as illustrated by Fig.\n\n1.12(d).\nNowadays, the transparent electrodes are typically made from indium tin oxide (ITO),\n\nbecause of its relatively good conductivity and optical transparency, as shown in a com-\nparative way with graphene in Figs. 1.12(a) and 1.12(b). But Indium is very expensive\nand toxic, moreover ITO has poor mechanical properties, such that it tends to crack\n\nwhen bent or stretched [55]. Hence, graphene has a realistic chance to be used in the\nmanufacture of flexible components needed in flexible and transparent electrodes, since\n\nit has been already demonstrated that graphene is mechanically robust and its synthesis\nby CVD consumes only tiny amounts of carbon gases and does not need rare mineral\n\nresources such as indium or silver, thus becoming, cheaper than ITO.\nMany companies have been increasingly struggling to achieve reasonable and optimized\n\nresults to be able to apply those experimental techniques on the mass production of\ngraphene. An example of the biggest investors in the development of new technologies\n\nusing graphene is the Samsung company, being one of various results obtained by the team\nsupported by this company illustrated in Fig. 1.12(d), that is a large sample of graphene\n\n\n\n1.5.

APPLICATIONS 55\n\nfilm developed in June 2010 by Samsung company using the roll-to-roll production and\n\nwet-chemical doping of predominantly monolayer 30-inch graphene grown by chemical\nvapour deposition onto flexible copper substrates [54].\n\n1.5.2 Coating with graphene\n\nAnother very interesting graphene application is related to preventing corrosion of\nmetals such as steel. In this purpose, graphene is used to coating the metals against\n\ncorrosion process, which is one of the greatest challenges faced by the metal industry, since\nthis effect occurs in a natural way, triggered by environmental factors, as the presence of\n\nwater, oxygen and electrolytes.\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 1.13: (a) Illustration depicting a graphene sheet as a chemically inert diffusion\nbarrier, preventing the reactive agent from ever reaching the metal underneath. (b)\n\nPhotograph showing graphene coated (upper) and uncoated (lower) penny after H2O2\ntreatment (30%, 2 min). (c) Photographs of Cu and Cu/Ni foil with and without graphene\ncoating taken before and after annealing in air (200 oC, 4 h). Adapted from Ref. [61].\n\nBecause of many adverse effects on human and environment health brought with\n\nthe usage of Chromium and Zinc as anticorrosive materials for metal coatings, different\ncorrosion protections have been sought in order to reduce production costs and the adverse\n\nside effects [57]. In this direction, graphene has attracted attention of the steel industry\nbecause it has a more efficient, innovative and cheaper technology to overcome corrosion\n\n\n\n1.5. APPLICATIONS 56\n\nissues, making a preventive and protective work against corrosion. The two properties\n\nthat provide graphene as a good anticorrosion mechanism are: (i) the impermeability of\npristine graphene, so that graphene coatings can make the path of permeating water more\ntortuous, acting as an excellent barrier to water, oxygen and other corrosive materials,\n\nand the fact that (ii) graphene has a higher electrical conductivity than steel.\nRecent approaches in the production process have proposed graphene-based coatings,\n\nwhich are composed by functionalized graphene incorporated into organic coatings [58].\nIt has been shown that these graphene hybrid nanocomposites demonstrate an excellent\n\ncorrosion inhibition capability when compared with current chromate-free anticorrosion\ntechnology, and comparable performance to chromate-based anticorrosion technology [59].\n\nThus these graphene-based coatings can be used as inhibitors in protective coatings to\nprevent oxidation of underlying metals in oxidizing chemicals, water or air for longer\n\nperiod [60, 61] and for bipolar plates in fuel cells, which are stainless steel components\nthat separate individual cells in a stack and aid in the distribution of fuel and oxidant,\nwater management and current collection [57].\n\nAs an illustrative example that thin layers of graphene in the top of metal surface serve\nas impermeable coatings, we show in Fig. 1.13 photograph images of two metal surfaces,\n\nNickel (Ni) and Copper (Cu), both graphene-coated and uncoated, after air anneals and\nexposure to liquid etchant. In all showed cases, the graphene-coated metal surfaces exhibit\n\nvery little visible change, as opposed to the uncoated metals whose surfaces change ap-\npearance dramatically. Thus, the use of graphene in coating process reduce the oxidation\n\nof the metals and in addition it does not alter their conductivity [61].\n\n1.5.3 Graphene photodetector\n\nThe unique physical properties of graphene make it suitable for detecting light, since\n\nthat: (i) electrons and holes move much faster through graphene than through other\nmaterials and (ii) it is very good at absorbing light over a very wide range of wavelengths,\n\nranging from the visible to the infrared, whereas thin layers of III-V semiconductors do not\nabsorb many infrared frequencies. The knowledge of these benefits opens the possibility\nto exploit graphene for optoelectronics using graphene sheets to make photodetectors.\n\nPhotodetectors are electronic components that measure photon flux or optical power\nby converting the absorbed photon energy (optical signals) into electrical current. They\n\nare widely used in a range of common devices, such as remote controls, televisions, DVD\nplayers and receivers in fiber optic networks where they return the light information\n\nto the form of an electric signal [52]. The modern light detectors are typically made\nusing III-V semiconductors, such as silicon or gallium arsenide. When light strikes these\n\nmaterials, each photon absorbed creates an electron-hole pair, which are then separated\nin an electrical field, which leads to an electrical current. This electrical field usually is\n\ngenerated by an external voltage applied to the component.\nThe photoelectrical response of graphene was first investigated by the IBM researchers\n\n\n\n1.5. APPLICATIONS 57\n\nteam led by Phaedon Avouris (see Fig. 1.14), that made use of the internal electric\n\nfield that exists at the interface of graphene and metal [62]. Through a sophisticated\ncombination of palladium (Pd) and titanium (Ti) electrodes they created a photodetector\nthat does not rely on external current. They did this by placing palladium or titanium\n\nelectrodes on top of a piece of multilayered or single-layered graphene. The metal contacts\nproduce electric fields at the interface between the electrodes and graphene. This electric\n\nfield separates the electrons and holes in a very efficient way, and thus a photocurrent\nis produced when light is shone onto the device. Using this specific arrangement, the\n\nIBM team overcame the problem of quick carrier recombination of the electrons and holes\ngenerated by incoming photons and, moreover, allowed to eliminate unwanted noise at the\n\nsame time, once that it does not need to apply a bias voltage for the device to operate.\nNormally this pair combination in graphene happens within tens of picoseconds, leaving\n\nno free electrons for current [62, 63].\n\nFigure 1.14: Schematic view of the metal-graphene-metal photodetector, where the elec-\ntrodes are composed by palladium (Pd) and titanium (Ti) located on the top of a piece\n\nof multilayered or single-layered graphene. VG is the gate bias. Adapted from Ref. [62].\n\nThereby, graphene-based devices can be also used in optical communications, remote\n\nsensing, environmental monitoring, terahertz detection, and surveillance. This brings a\nsignificant impact on mainstream optical applications into photonics, specially due to the\n\nfact that graphene photodetectors can operate with an internal quantum efficiency of\n15 ? 30%, despite its gapless nature and, in addition, it enables an ultrawide range of\noperational wavelengths [64].\n\n\n\n1.5. APPLICATIONS 58\n\n1.5.4 Challenges in graphene commercialization\n\nDespite the plenty of possible advantages that graphene could bring with its usage\nas a base-compound for electronics, photoelectronics, spintronics and valleytronics, many\n\nconsiderable challenges must be overcome to integrate this material into the commercial\ndevices, even for the graphene researches that are in high progress level. It follows some\n\nhindrances in the attempt to make graphene become useful for realistic applications, which\nincludes the development and the improvement of [55]:\n\n\u2022 a low-cost and large-scale synthesis method for high-quality graphene [55];\n\n\u2022 manufacturing techniques with guaranteed of uniformity and reproducibility [65];\n\n\u2022 defect- and residue-free transfer method that is compatible with conventional device\nmanufacturing processes [66];\n\n\u2022 doping processes that can assure stable, high electrical conductivity over long peri-\nods [67];\n\n\u2022 methods to insure the environmental stability of graphene electrodes against mois-\nture and chemicals in the air [68];\n\n\u2022 methods to decrease the contact resistance between electrodes and active materials\n[69].\n\nLimited material availability and material cost to produce in quality are the two of the\nmost significant factors that could affect the speed of commercial deployment of graphene.\n\nAlthough there are diverse methods to produce different types of graphene material, the\ndevelopment of graphene manufacturing methods still need achieve a experience degree\n\nto outstrip demand for quality, quantity, reliability, consistency and price. The choice of\nproduction process depends on the required graphene properties and the targeted appli-\n\ncation, which it turn will define the volume and price requirements, i. e. the material cost\nrequired to enable commercialization is application-dependent. In the other words, one\ncan see that the large-scale manufacturing method for the industry needs standardization\n\nand industrialization, otherwise it may slow the commercial adoption of graphene in the\nindustry [70].\n\nAnother critical market barrier that could affect the speed of adoption of graphene\nis the resistance produced by incumbent materials and technologies. For example, if the\n\ngraphene turn out to indeed replace silicon in electronics, then all sectors of industrial\nchain must undergo a transformation to suit their methods of graphene production. Thus,\n\ncertainly graphene should feel a resistance by existing suppliers in an attempt to slow down\nor prevent a switch to this new material [70].\n\nTo illustrate the level of some graphene applications and in which stages they are up\nto now, we present in Fig. 1.15 a block diagram showing the applications related to three\n\n\n\n1.5.

Adapted from Ref. [70].\n\nmain types of graphene product: graphene films, graphene oxide (GO) flakes and graphene\n\nnanoplatelets, in which they are classified by technology readiness level from 1 (basic\nprinciples) to 9 (operation). As one can realize, the discussed applications in previous\nsection using graphene as a based to photodetectors, flexible and transparent devices\n\nand coating are placed respectively in the stage of applied research and development and\ndemonstration. It shows that these applications are niche applications that present low\n\nbarriers to adoption and are close to commercialization. According to some experts in\nemerging technologies field, the number of organizations developing graphene applications\n\nand the number of patents filed may suggest an opportunity for a further acceleration of\ngraphene commercialization, such as expressed in the following quote: \u201cJudging from the\n\nprogress to date, the resources mobilized worldwide and the level of industry awareness,\ngraphene might be on track to become a commercial reality in less than 20 years from\n\nthe first attempts at commercialization.\u201d, said by the researchers A. Zurutuza and C.\nMarinelli that work at Graphenea and at Applied Graphene Materials [70].\n\n1.5.5 Granted investments to graphene\n\nSince the graphene isolation in 2004 [18] and the first series of published papers that\n\ntriggered a sharp rise in the level of graphene research efforts worldwide, many companies\nhave been attracted attention to the possible graphene applications. It has been esti-\n\n\n\n1.5. APPLICATIONS 60\n\nmated that more than 44 companies currently active are now involved in research around\n\ngraphene [70]. This wave of investments around the world heading toward a new techno-\nlogical revolution has been fuelled by both public and private investments, composed for\nexample by European Commission, UK and Korean governments and by the private ven-\n\ntures from Samsung, IBM and Nokia. To have an idea of how much substantial is being\ninvested nowadays, we will cite now the amount by three mentioned governments. In 2013,\n\nthe European Commission elected graphene to be one of Europe\u2019s 10-year 1 billion euro\nFuture Emerging Technology flagships. This program is called as Graphene Flagship7 and\n\ncoordinates 76 academic and industrial research groups in 17 European countries. An-\nother examples are South Korea, that has invested US$ 200 million in graphene research\n\nsince 2012, where significant contributions come from private industries like Samsung,\nand the United Kingdom, that has invested a more modest amount of 50 million euro at\n\nthe beginning of 2012 [71]. These investments indicate an important involvement of the\ncompanies worldwide with graphene, proving it to be a very promising market. In 2013,\nthe size of the graphene market was estimated to be around US$12 million [70], and the\n\nmarket projections for the next years indicate significant expansion and revenue increase.\nThe IDTechEx8, that has provided independent market research, business intelligence and\n\nevents on emerging technology to clients in over 80 countries, has been closely tracking the\ngraphene market for over two years and realized that: \u201cGraphene markets will grow from\n\naround $20 million in 2014 to more than $390 million in 2024 at the material level. The\nmarket will be split across many application sectors; each attracting a different type of\n\ngraphene manufactured using different means. The market today remains dominated by\nresearch interest but the composition will change as other sectors such as energy storage\n\nand composites grow.\u201d.\nOther indexes that reflect the progress in the commercialization and research develop-\n\nment in graphene are the number of patents and publications in this field. These data are\n\nshown in Fig. 1.16 for (a) the number of publications and (b) patent applications per year\nfor three carbon allotropes: carbon nanotubes, graphene and fullerenes, and (c) patents\n\nyearly from both corporations and academic institutions. In all graphics in Fig. 1.16, it\nis presented some historical points about the research evolution in the timeline. One can\n\nrealize the expressive amount of publications and patents involving graphene, that seems\nto increase more and more leading a positive effect in the speed of commercial deployment\n\nof graphene. Just in 2010, about 3000 papers were published on graphene, reflecting a\nshift in research away from carbon nanotubes. Associating the representative scientific\n\ndiscoveries and the number of patents in Fig. 1.16(c), one can notice that around 2007\ngraphene became more widely known in the science and industrial research communities\n\nsuch as a spike in numbers of patent applications both from corporations and academic\n\n7For more information visit the official website from Graphene Flagship:\n\n<http://graphene-flagship.eu/>.\n8Read more at:&lt;http://www.idtechex.com/research/reports/graphene-markets-technologies-\n\nand-opportunities-2014-2024-000390.asp?viewopt=showall>\n\n\n\n1.5.

We will also calculate the energy\n\nspectra of both monolayer and bilayer graphene under the influence of an external per-\npendicular magnetic field, showing thus the Landau levels. In addition to the models\n\nto compute the electronic structure of graphene, we will also present the Split-operator\ntechnique for a Tight-binding Hamiltonian and for the Dirac Hamiltonian.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we will present a systematic study of the energy spectra of graphene\nquantum rings having different geometries and edge types, in the presence of a perpen-\n\ndicular magnetic field. Four kinds of geometry will be considered: triangle, rhombus,\nhexagon and circle, with two edge types: armchair and zigzag. The results will be ob-\n\ntained within both the tight-binding and Dirac models, in order to compare and discuss\nwhich features can be recovered by using the approximations imposed by Dirac model.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we will derive a general expression for the infinite-mass boundary con-\n\ndition in bilayer graphene using the four-band continuum model. This new boundary\ncondition can be used for any kind of circular confined structure, as a bilayer quantum\n\ndot or a bilayer quantum ring. In this Chapter we will apply this boundary condition\nto calculate analytically the confined states and the corresponding wave functions in a\n\nbilayer graphene quantum dot in the absence and presence of a perpendicular magnetic\nfield. We will discuss the kinds of symmetry present in the studied system and also show\n\nsome of its properties, such as its cyclotron resonance.\nIn Chapter 5, we will investigate the confined states in two different hybrid monolayer\n\n- bilayer systems. They are defined as: (i) a hexagonal anti-dot in bilayer graphene under\nperpendicularly applied electric field and (ii) a hexagonal bilayer graphene dot surrounded\n\nby a hexagonal region of monolayer graphene. Using the tight-binding model, we will\nstudy the behavior of the energy levels as a function of dot size and under an applied\nexternal magnetic field. We will also identify which states are dot-localized states, or\n\n\n\n1.6. ORGANIZATION OF THE THESIS 63\n\nedge states or even mixed states.\n\nIn Chapter 6, we will numerically study the influence of the graphene edges in the\nscattering of a Gaussian wave packet. Furthermore, we will investigate the skipping\norbits when an external magnetic field is applied and also what happens when the sample\n\nis submitted to a pseudo-magnetic field induced by non-uniform strain.\nIn Chapter 7, we will calculate the transmission probabilities of a Gaussian wave packet\n\nthrough a quantum point contact defined by electrostatic gates in bilayer graphene. Two\nkinds of the potential alignment will be considered, in order to provide a bias between the\n\nlayers. In one of the cases, the gates will be set such that on both sides of the contact will\nproduce the same bias and so an energy gap. It is similar as in an usual quantum point\n\ncontact. In the other case, the bias will be inverted on one of the sides of the quantum\npoint contact, although still forming the same energy gap at both sides. It will be done\n\nto allow only electrons belonging to one of the Dirac valleys to pass. Thus we will provide\nwhich parameters improve the efficiency of proposed bilayer system as a valley filtering,\nsuch as length, width and amplitude of the applied potential.\n\nFinally, the thesis is concluded in Chapter 8, where we summarize the main results\nand we give some suggestions for future works.\n\n\n\n2\nTheoretical framework and methodology\n\nIn the solution to the problems proposed in this thesis for the study of nano-graphene\nstructures, we shall use the tight-binding model and Dirac equation, which we will de-\n\ntail below. Another mathematical tool that was computationally implemented and also\nused in the development of this thesis is the Split-operator technique, which will also be\npresented as follows in this Chapter.\n\n2.1 Graphene\n\nWe start with the microscopic definition of graphene to obtain latter, in the low-energy\napproximation, the continuum model for charge carriers dynamics. But first, let us discuss\nhow this material has been studied in recent years [8].\n\nGraphene is a two-dimensional crystal formed by carbon atoms arranged in a hon-\neycomb lattice. This structure can be viewed as two superposed triangular sublattices\n\nshifted one from each other, A and B, or as a single lattice with two atoms per unit cell,\nas shown in Fig. 2.1.\n\nThe lattice vectors can be written as\n\n~a1 =\n3a\n\n2\nx? +\n\n?\n3a\n\n2\ny? ~a2 =\n\n3a\n\n2\nx? ?\n\n?\n3a\n\n2\ny?, (2.1)\n\nwhere a ? 1.42 \u00c5 is the lattice parameter, i. e., the smallest distance between two carbon\natoms that forms the C C bond. The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by\n\n~b1 =\n2?\n\n3a\nx? +\n\n2\n?\n3?\n\n3a\ny? ~b2 =\n\n2?\n\n3a\nx? ? 2\n\n?\n3?\n\n3a\ny?. (2.2)\n\nIn the second quantization formalism, we have that the tight-binding Hamiltonian for\nelectrons in graphene, considering only the first neighbors terms, is given by\n\nH =\n?\n\ni\n\n(?i + Mi)(a\n\u2020\ni ai + b\n\n\u2020\ni bi) +\n\n?\n\n<i,j>\n\n(?i,ja\n\u2020\ni bj + ?\n\n?\ni,jb\n\n\u2020\njai), (2.3)\n\nwhere a\u2020i and ai are creation and annihilation operators, respectively, for electrons on the\nsite i, with self-energy ?i, for the sublattice A, while b\n\n\u2020\ni and bi are the same operators for\n\n\n\n2.1.

The area in yellow shows\n\nthe unit cell. (b) The first two Brillouin zones and the points of high symmetry of the\nreciprocal lattice (~b1, ~b2) are also shown. The Dirac cones are located at the K and K?\n\npoints.\n\nthe sublattice B, and ?i,j is the hopping parameter. In order to consider the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field in the tight-binding model, one should include a phase on hopping\n\nparameters, taking a Peierls transformation [1, 73] described as ?ij ? ?ij exp\n[\nie\n~\n\n? i\nj\n~A.d~l\n\n]\n,\n\nwhere ~A is the vector potential related to the external magnetic field. A strain field\nwould lead to a variation of the interatomic distances and, consequently, of the hopping\n\nenergy between sites, leading to changes such as ?i,j ? ?i,j(1 + 2?ai,j/a0) with ?ai,j =\nai,j ? a0, where ai,j is the distance between the atoms after the application of strain field\n[74, 75, 76]. The Mi term appears as a mass-related term in the continuum model, as we\nwill demonstrate further on. This term is a staggered site-dependent potential, which is\n\npositive (negative) if the i-site belongs to the lattice A (B). Due to this property, such\npotential is normally used to simulate confining structures in graphene, such as quantum\n\ndots and rings [77], where it leads to a gap.\nWithout loss of generality, we omit for simplicity the first sum of the Hamiltonian (2.3)\n\nwhose only effect is to shift the Fermi energy level of the system. Let us also consider\n\nthat all the hopping energies are equal to t ? 2.8 eV [1]. Thus we have that1\n\nH = ?\n?\n\n<i,j>\n\nt(a\n\u2020\ni bj + b\n\n\u2020\njai). (2.4)\n\nBy considering an infinite lattice, we can make a Fourier transform of the creation and\n\nannihilation operators presented in Hamiltonian (2.4):\n\nai =\n1?\nN\n\n?\n\nk\n\nei\n~k\u00b7~riak a\n\n\u2020\ni =\n\n1?\nN\n\n?\n\nk\n\ne?i\n~k\u00b7~ria\n\n\u2020\nk (2.5)\n\n1The symbol&lt;> below of the summation means that the sum is performed only for the nearest\nneighbors.\n\n\n\n2.1.

(2.5) and (2.6) in Hamiltonian (2.4), and also considering only the\ninteractions with the first three nearest neighbors, we obtain that\n\nH = ?t\n?\n\nk\n\n[g(~k)a\n\u2020\nkbk + g\n\n?(~k)b\n\u2020\nkak], (2.7)\n\nwhere\ng(~k) = eik\n\n?\n\nxa + 2 cos(k?y\n?\n3a/2)e?ik\n\n?\n\nxa/2 (2.8)\n\nis the structure factor of the crystalline lattice.\n\nSince we can write H =\n?\n\nk ??k|Hk|?k?, where |?k? = (ak, bk)T and Hk are, respec-\ntively, the electronic states and the Hamiltonian for a particular ~k, therefore we now write\n\nthe Hamiltonian (2.7) in a matrix form\n\nHk =\n\n(\n0 ?tg(~k)\n\n?tg?(~k) 0\n\n)\n. (2.9)\n\nBy diagonalization on the Hamiltonian (2.9) we obtain that the eigenvalues are\n\nE\u00b1k = \u00b1t|g(~k)| = \u00b1t\n?\n\n3 + f(~k), (2.10)\n\nwhere f(~k) = 4 cos(3kxa/2) cos(\n?\n3kya/2) + 2 cos(\n\n?\n3kya).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nK\n\nK\u00b4\n\nK\n\nK\u00b4\n\nK\n\nK\u00b4\n\nFigure 2.2: (a) Electronic dispersion relation of graphene with a zoom in the energy bands,\nshowing the conical relationship nearby K and K? Dirac points. (b) Contour plot of the\n\nconduction band on the first Brillouin zone.\n\nAs it can be seen from Fig. 2.2, the band structure of graphene is gapless at six points,\nknown as the Dirac points. In the vicinity of these points, one observes that there is a\nconical electronic dispersion, suggesting that the electron in these nearby of the reciprocal\n\nspace should behave as a massless quasiparticle described by the Dirac equation, which\n\n\n\n2.1. GRAPHENE 67\n\nalso has a linear dependence with energy. Only two of the six cones are not equivalent,\n\nwhose positions in reciprocal space are given by the vectors\n\n~K =\n\n(\n2?\n\n3a\n,\n\n2?\n\n3\n?\n3a\n\n)\n~K? =\n\n(\n2?\n\n3a\n, ? 2?\n\n3\n?\n3a\n\n)\n. (2.11)\n\nUntil the present moment, we have described the electronic behavior in a microscopic\napproach given by the Hamiltonian (2.9). Reducing the model to the study of the elec-\n\ntronic behavior only in the vicinity of the Dirac points, we achieve the continuum model.\nTo do this, we will expand the non-zero terms of Hamiltonian (2.9) in a Taylor series\naround these ~K e ~K? points. Thus, retaining just the first-order terms of g(~k), we get:\n\n\u2022 For K:\ng(~k) =\n\n3a\n\n2\n(k?x ? ik?y)e?i\n\n5?\n6 . (2.12)\n\n\u2022 For K?:\ng(~k) =\n\n3a\n\n2\n(?k?x ? ik?y)e?i\n\n?\n6 . (2.13)\n\nThe complex exponentials in Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13) may be included in the wave functions\nwithout any changes to the physical system, once that the quadratic norms of these terms\n\nare 1. Including Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13) in Hamiltonian (2.9) we get\n\nHk = ~vf\n\n(\n0 \u00b1k?x ? ik?y\n\n\u00b1k?x + ik?y 0\n\n)\n, (2.14)\n\nwhere vf = 3at/2~ is the Fermi velocity and the signs + and ? are related to the low-\nenergy electrons around K and K? points, respectively. In a more compact form, we can\nwrite\n\nHk = vf~? \u00b7 ~p. (2.15)\n\nThe Hamiltonian (2.14) is the bidimensional Dirac Hamiltonian that describes rela-\n\ntivistic electrons with a zero mass and with the light velocity c replaced by the Fermi\nvelocity vf . For this reason, it is usual to say that the electrons in graphene behave like\n\nmassless relativistic fermions.\nIn the presence of external magnetic fields ~B and potentials V and M, the Hamiltonian\n\nfrom Eq. (2.15) can be generalized in the form\n\nHD = vf~? \u00b7\n(\n~p + e~A\n\n)\n+ V (x,y)I + ?M(x,y)?z, (2.16)\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix 2 \u00d7 2, ? = 1(?1) for the cone K(K?), M(~r) is a site-\ndependent potential related to the mass term, as previously mentioned in Eq. (2.3) being\nused to create a gap in the energy spectrum and simulate electronic confinements [77, 78],\nand the eigenstates are pseudospinors ? = [?A, ?B]T , where ?A(B) gives the probability\n\nof finding the electron in sublattice A(B).2 In the next sections we shall comment more\n\n2The presented Hamiltonian one refers to the K point. For the K? point one should replace ~? by ~??.\n\n\n\n2.2. BILAYER GRAPHENE 68\n\nabout the influence of magnetic field on the energy spectrum of monolayer and bilayer\n\ngraphene, and we shall discuss the Hamiltonian (2.15) in more details in the Chapter 3\nas well.\n\nWith these two basic tools for the study of electrons in graphene, we can develop\n\ntheories for finite systems, based on tight-binding model, and for low-energy electrons in\ninfinite systems, through the Dirac model.\n\n2.2 Bilayer graphene\n\nAs a natural extension of the model used for monolayer graphene, as given in the pre-\nvious section, we shall introduce in this section the commonly-used tight-binding model\n\nfor bilayer graphene, as well its band and crystal structures. The the tight-binding frame-\nwork for bilayer graphene deals with a higher complexity due to the introduction of various\n\ninter-layer hopping elements that were not considered in monolayer case. Although there\nare these additional contributions, we shall treat here only the simplest generalization of\nbilayer description under some approximations. The external bias potential shall be also\n\ninvestigated.\n\n(a) (b)\n\ng\n1\n\ng\n0g\n\n3\ng\n\n4\na\n\nd\n(c)\n\nB2\n\nB1\n\nA2\n\nA1\n\nFigure 2.3: (a) The crystal structure of bilayer graphene in Bernal stacking with the\nvarious hopping parameters. The bottom (top) layer is represented by dashed (solid)\n\nlines with triangular sublattices formed by A1 (yellow) and B1 (brown) (A2 (black) and\nB2 (green)) sites. ?0 is the inter-layer hopping energy and ?1,3,4 are the intra-layer hopping\n\nenergies. (b) Perspective and (c) top views of crystalline structure of bilayer graphene,\nemphasizing the A1 ?B2 connections and the middle position of the A2 sites with respect\nto the carbon hexagons in bottom layer. a ? 1.42 \u00c5 and d ? 3.35 \u00c5 are the inter-atomic\nand intra-layer distances between the two closer carbon atoms in the same layer and\n\nbetween the two layers, respectively.\n\nThe bilayer graphene (BLG) consists of two coupled graphene layers linked by Van-\n\nder-Waals bounds with a separation distance of d ? 3.35 \u00c5. These two parallel layers are\nformed by carbon atoms and arranged each one with a honeycomb arrangement, as in\n\na monolayer. The most typical arrangement considered for the bilayer structure is the\nBernal stacked bilayer graphene, also called AB-stacked bilayer graphene, although AA\n\n\n\n2.2. BILAYER GRAPHENE 69\n\nstacking3 is also possible but not as stable [7]. In AB stacking, one layer is rotated by 60o\n\nwith respect to the other. It implies that the layers are positioned so that the sublattice\nB of upper layer lies exactly on top of the sublattice A of the lower layer, whereas the\nsublattice A of upper layer (A2) are located on the middle of the carbon hexagons of the\n\nlower layer4. Figure 2.3 shows the crystal structure of bilayer graphene in Bernal stacking\nconfiguration in different views.\n\nThe tight-binding Hamiltonian that describes ? electrons in a AB-stacked bilayer\ngraphene can be written as [1, 79, 80]\n\nHBLG =\n?\n\ni,j\n\n2?\n\nn=1\n\n(\nEAna\n\n\u2020\ni;nai;n + EBnb\n\n\u2020\nj;naj;n\n\n)\n(2.17)\n\n? ?0\n?\n\ni,j\n\n2?\n\nn=1\n\n(\na\n\u2020\ni;nbj;n + b\n\n\u2020\nj;nai;n\n\n)\n\n? ?1\n?\n\ni,j\n\n(\na\n\u2020\ni;1bj;2 + b\n\n\u2020\nj;2ai;1\n\n)\n\n? ?3\n?\n\ni,j\n\n(\na\n\u2020\ni;2bj;1 + b\n\n\u2020\nj;1ai;2\n\n)\n(2.18)\n\n? ?4\n?\n\ni,j\n\n(\na\n\u2020\ni;1aj;2 + a\n\n\u2020\nj;2ai;2 + b\n\n\u2020\ni;1bj;2 + b\n\n\u2020\nj;2bi;1\n\n)\n,\n\nwhere ai;n(a\n\u2020\ni;n) annihilates (creates) an electron on the site i of sublattice A of layer\n\nn, while ai;n(a\n\u2020\ni;n) act likewise on the site j of sublattice B. Thus, we can understand\n\neach contribution of the Hamiltonian through the hopping parameters as in graphite\n\nnomenclature, such as [1]: (i) the first term of the Hamiltonian represents the on-site\nenergy of the sublattices An and Bn for each layer n; (ii) the intra-layer contributions\nbetween the atoms of the same layer n are described by the second part of the Hamiltonian,\n\nonce that ?0 = t ? 2.8 eV is the in-plane hopping energy (A1 ? B1 and A2 ? B2); (iii)\nthe third part of the Hamiltonian that contains the term ?1 = t? ? 0.4 eV describes the\nmost important inter-layer coupling, since there is no projection of the vector connecting\nthe dimer bond between the two lattice sites A1 and B2 on the xy-plane (A1 ? B2); (iv)\nthe inter-layer coupling ?3 ? 0.3 eV corresponds to the hopping between the sites B1 and\nA2; and (v) the last term of the Hamiltonian is linked to the hopping energy due to the\n\nbounds between the sites A1 and A2.\nIn the simplest case, we can approximate the Hamiltonian (2.17) considering only\n\ninter-layer coupling t?, which connects the two atoms stacked right on top of each other,\n3For more details[81] about the Hamiltonian described using the AA stacking to see Appendix A.\n4The unit cell for the bilayer problem has four atoms, being a pair A1, B1 (A2, B2) from the lower\n\n(upper) layer, instead of just two as in monolayer case. The primitive lattice vectors for bilayer lattice\nare the same as for monolayer graphene ~a1 and ~a2, as well as the area in the x ? y plane of the unit cell,\nas shown in Fig. 2.1(a). Thus, since the unit cell of bilayer graphene contains four atoms, and, if the\n\ntight-binding model includes one p\nz\n\norbital per atomic site, there will be four bands near zero energy,\ninstead of the two bands in monolayer graphene, as showed in Fig. 2.4.\n\n\n\n2.2. BILAYER GRAPHENE 70\n\nand the nearest-neighbour in-plane hopping parameter t. Following the same scheme as\n\nfor the monolayer as discussed in section 2.1 and considering only the pz electrons which\nform the ? bands, there are this way four orbital wave functions and consequently the\ntight-binding Hamiltonian is now a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix given by\n\nHk =\n\n?\n????\n\n0 ?tg(~k) t? 0\n?tg?(~k) 0 0 0\nt? 0 0 ?tg?(~k)\n0 0 ?tg(~k) 0\n\n?\n????\n. (2.19)\n\nIt consists of two single-layer Hamiltonian on the diagonal, similar as Eq. (2.9), with g(~k)\nfrom Eq. (2.8). The off-diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks describe the inter-layer coupling. The above\nmatrix can be diagonalized resulting in the corresponding spectrum [7]\n\nE\u00b1\u00b1k = \u00b1\nt?\n2\n\n\u00b1\n?\nt2?\n4\n\n+ t|g(~k)|2, (2.20)\n\nformed by four eigenvalues and consequently four bands. These four energy bands are\n\ncomposed by two conduction bands and two valence bands. The bilayer graphene spec-\ntrum seems like the the band structure of monolayer graphene, except for the fact that\n\neach monolayer band split into two by an energy approximately equal to the inter-layer\ncoupling t?, i. e. the gap separation between the two non-touching bands around the K\n\nand K? points is 2t? being these two upper bands with energies E\n+\n+ ? t? and E?? ? ?t?.\n\nBut in contrast to the band structure of monolayer graphene, bilayer graphene spectrum\nturns out to be a gapless semiconductor with parabolic band. An illustration of the elec-\n\ntronic band of the bilayer graphene in the absence of external bias potential is shown in\nFig. 2.4(a).\n\nRepeating the same procedure performed for the single-layer case to obtain the effective\nHamiltonian in the form as expressed in Eq. (2.14), i. e. using continuum model for the\n\nlow-energy approximation close to the K and K? points, we can construct, in analogy, the\nfollowing effective Hamiltonian for bilayer graphene\n\nHBLG =\n\n?\n????\n\n0 ? t? 0\n\n?\u2020 0 0 0\n\nt? 0 0 ?\n\u2020\n\n0 0 ? 0\n\n?\n????\n, (2.21)\n\nwhere ? = vF (?px + ipy) and ?\u2020 = vF (?px ? ipy), with ? = +1 or ? = ?1 to denote the\nHamiltonian that corresponds to the K or K? valleys, and px,y = ~kx,y.

(2.26)\n\nThis spectrum with an applied bias potential is illustrated in Fig. 2.4(b). As V can\n\nbe externally controlled, this model predicts that biased bilayer graphene should be a\ntunable-gap semiconductor. Notice that the gap does not reach a minimum at the K\n\npoint (it has a maximum at k = 0) due to the \u201cMexican-hat\u201d dispersion at low energies.\nUsing continuum model and expanding the Hamiltonian around to the K and K?

(2.26). The two lowest bands with a\n\u201cMexican hat\u201d format correspond to the signs inside the square being negative (?). Figure\n2.4(c) shows the spectrum for four different potential configurations, being the black\nsolid, dashed red, dotted blue and green short-dotted curves corresponding respectively\n\nbecause it would require a special periodic (staggered) potential, since the sites A and B are identical\nand adjacent on the same layer.\n\n\n\n2.3.

One can realize that as |U| is made larger, the \u201cMexican hat\u201d\nshaped band gap becomes more pronounced.\n\nThese results for the bias bilayer graphene suggest a route to new nanoelectronic de-\n\nvices. By combination of top and bottom gates, one can control the gap in the bilayer\nspectrum and hence define confinement structures, which are even able to localize elec-\n\ntrons.\n\n2.3 Influence of an external perpendicular magnetic field\n\nLet us now investigate the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field ~B on the energy\n\nlevels of monolayer and bilayer graphene. We will obtain discrete energy levels (so called\nLandau levels (LLs)) of two-dimensional electrons in the presence of an external magnetic\n\nfield. But first, we will discuss briefly the classical case.\n\n2.3.1 Classical picture\n\nIn classical electrodynamics, a charged particle q with mass m under the influence of\n\na external magnetic field ~B experiences a magnetic force described by following equation\n\n~F = q\n(\n~v \u00d7 ~B\n\n)\n, (2.30)\n\nwhere ~v is the charge velocity. An illustration is present in Fig. 2.5(a), where it is pointed\n\nthe orientation of each these vectors.\n\nB v\n\nF\n\nr\n\nq\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.5: (a) Scheme of a charged particle with charge q and mass m performing a\ncircular motion due to the influence of an external perpendicular magnetic field. The\n\norientation of the vectors velocity ~v and magnetic force ~F are presented. (b) Classical\nskipping orbits experienced by a charge particle under a perpendicular magnetic field.\n\nConsidering that a particle moves within an uniform magnetic field and there are no\nother external forces in addition to the magnetic field, then if the initial particle velocity\n\n\n\n2.3. INFLUENCE OF AN EXTERNAL PERPENDICULAR MAGNETIC FIELD 74\n\nis perpendicular to the magnetic field with magnitude qvB, one has that in each instant\n\nthe magnitude of the velocity remains constant, once that at each moment the force\nis perpendicular to the velocity. This results in an uniform circular motion, such as\nmv2/r = qvB. The path is consequently a circular orbit, so called cyclotron orbit, with\n\nradius r = mv/qB and angular velocity w = qB/m. An example of the charged particle\nmoving close to the edges of a certain material under the presence of a uniforme and\n\nperpendicular magnetic field is shown in Fig. 2.5(b). Notice that the particle performs\nsemi-circular orbits. This orbits are called as skipping orbits, since that each time that\n\nthe particle reaches the edge, the direction of its momentum is changed.\n\n2.3.2 Landau levels in a monolayer graphene\n\nThe Hamiltonian that describes a free electron in a single-layer graphene with a per-\n\npendicular applied magnetic field can be written as\n\nH = vF~? \u00b7 ~? (2.31)\n\nwhere we performed the transformation ~p ? ~? = ~p+e~A in Eq. (2.15), being ~A the vector\npotential that generates the magnetic field ~B = ? \u00d7 ~A and e the elementary charge. This\ntransformation for electrons on a lattice in the presence of magnetic field is valid for the\ncase that the magnetic length\n\nlB =\n\n?\neB\n\n~\n(2.32)\n\nis much lager than the interatomic distance a. As a is in the order of 1.42 \u00c5 and any\n\nexperimentally available fields produced in the labs are less than B ? 104 T, then the\napproximation involved in this transformation is not violated. Considering the Landau\n\ngauge ~A = (0,B0x, 0) defined by an uniform magnetic field ~B = B0z?, we can write Eq.\n(2.31) explicitly as\n\nH = ?i~vf\n(\n\n0 ?\n?x\n\n? i ?\n?y\n\n+ eB0\n~\nx\n\n?\n?x\n\n+ i ?\n?y\n\n? eB0\n~\nx 0\n\n)\n. (2.33)\n\nThe two-component wave function ?(x,y) can be assumed as the following form\n\n?(x,y) =\n\n(\n?A(x,y)\n\n?B(x,y)\n\n)\n= eikyy\n\n(\n?A(x)\n\n?B(x)\n\n)\n, (2.34)\n\nsince that, for the choosen gauge, the y-coordinate does not appear in the Hamiltonian, the\nHamiltonian commutes with py, i. e. [H,py] = 0, being py this way a constant of motion.\n\nThis implies that the eigenstates of the py should be also eigenstates of the Hamiltonian,\nwith eigenvalue given by ~vF . Solving the eigenvalue problem H?(x,y) = E?(x,y)\n\n\n\n2.3. INFLUENCE OF AN EXTERNAL PERPENDICULAR MAGNETIC FIELD 75\n\nresults in two coupled differential equations\n[\n?\n\n?x\n+ ky +\n\nx\n\nl2B\n\n]\n?B =\n\niE\n\n~vF\n?A, (2.35a)\n\n[\n?\n\n?x\n? ky ?\n\nx\n\nl2B\n\n]\n?A =\n\niE\n\n~vF\n?B. (2.35b)\n\nInserting one equation into another, we can decouple the equations as\n[\n?2\n\n?x2\n? (kylB + x)2 + 1 +\n\n(\nElB\n~vF\n\n)2]\n?B = 0, (2.36)\n\nwhere it was considered the dimensionless unit x = x/lB. The above second-order differ-\nential equation seems like [82]\n\n?\n??\n\nn(x) +\n(\n2n + 1 ? x2\n\n)\n?n(x) = 0, (2.37)\n\nwhich solutions are the well-known Hermite polynomials Hn(x), with ?(x)n = e?x\n2/2Hn(x).\n\nThus comparing Eqs. (2.36) and (2.37), we obtain a discrete spectrum given by\n\nEn = \u00b1\n~vF\nlB\n\n?\n2n, (2.38)\n\nwith n = 0, 1, 2, ..., where En are the Landau levels for a monolayer graphene. The\n\npositive values correspond to electrons (conduction band), while the negative values cor-\nrespond to holes (valence band). Repeating the same procedure but now decoupling for\n\nthe ?A component, one obtains that\n[\n?2\n\n?x2\n? (kylB + x)2 ? 1 +\n\n(\nElB\n~vF\n\n)2]\n?A = 0, (2.39)\n\nsuch that now, comparing Eqs. (2.37) and (2.39), the energy levels are given by\n\nEn = \u00b1\n~vF\nlB\n\n?\n2(n + 1). (2.40)\n\nwhich, comparing to the previous results Eq. (2.38), lacks the level with E = 0. The\n\nexistence of a zeroth Landau level E0 = 0 is a direct consequence of the zero gap in\nthe energy spectrum for Dirac fermions in graphene. This zeroth Landau level has twice\n\nsmaller degeneracy as compared with the other Landau levels. Another important remark\nabout Eqs. (2.38) and (2.40) is that the Landau levels are independent of the valley\n\nindex. Thus, the zeroth Landau level has actually four-fold degeneracy, being two-fold\nassociated with the electron-hole symmetry and the another two-fold because of valley\n\nsymmetry. A consequence of different dependence of the energy levels for sublattices A\n(EA ?\n\n?\n2(n + 1)) and B (EA ?\n\n?\n2n), which must differ in the index n for 1 to yield the\n\nsame energy eigenvalue for both, results in a different occupation of the sublattices A and\nB. This means that the wave function at the Landau level n = 0 should have non-zero\n\n\n\n2.3. INFLUENCE OF AN EXTERNAL PERPENDICULAR MAGNETIC FIELD 76\n\namplitude only on B (A) sublattice for valley K (K?), while at the Landau level n 6= 0\nshould always have non-zero amplitudes on both sublattices A and B.\n\nAccording to Eq. (2.37), the eigenfunctions can be written as\n(\n?A(x)\n\n?B(x)\n\n)\n? e?(kylB+x)\n\n2/2\n\n(\nHnA (kylB + x)\nHnB (kylB + x)\n\n)\n, (2.41)\n\nwith nB =\n1\n2\n\n(\nElB\n~vF\n\n)2\nand nA = nB ? 1, being the wave functions not normalized.\n\nComparing the obtained Landau levels by Eqs. (2.38) and (2.40) with Landau levels\n\nfor a conventional electron gas within the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, one can notice that the\nlatter has equidistant energy levels En = ~eB/m(n + 1/2), which is due to the parabolic\n\ndispersion law of free electron, and a linear dependence on the magnetic field En ?\n(n + 1/2)B, whereas the Landau levels in graphene are not equally spaced and follow a\nsquare root dependence on the magnetic field En ?\n\n?\n2nB. The largest energy separation\n\nis between the zeroth and first Landau levels, as one can see in Fig. 2.6(a). Experimental\nresults about the Landau levels in graphene have been reported in Refs. [83], [84] and\n\n[85].\n\n2.3.3 Landau levels in a bilayer graphene\n\nThe single particle Hamiltonian for bilayer graphene in the continuum approximation,\n\nin the vicinity of the K point and in the presence of applied bias potentials U1 and U2,\nrespectively for the upper and lower layer, is the 4 \u00d7 4 matrix\n\nH =\n\n?\n????\n\nU1 ? t 0\n\n?\u2020 U1 0 0\n\nt 0 U2 ?\n\u2020\n\n0 0 ?

In the presence of an external magnetic field ~B = B0z?\n\nperpendicular to the bilayer graphene sheet, ? and ?\u2020 are given by\n\n? = ?i~vF\n[\n?\n\n?x\n+ i\n\n(\n?\n\n?y\n+ i\n\neB0\n~\nx\n\n)]\n, (2.43a)\n\n?\u2020 = ?i~vF\n[\n?\n\n?x\n? i\n(\n?\n\n?y\n+ i\n\neB0\n~\nx\n\n)]\n, (2.43b)\n\nwhere we used the Landau gauge for the vector potential ~A = (0,B0x, 0). In a similar\nway as for the Dirac Hamiltonian Eq. (2.33), the Hamiltonian for bilayer graphene Eq.\n\n(2.42) commutes with py and therefore is a conserved quantity. As [H,py] = 0, then one\n\n\n\n2.3.

(2.46d)\n\nWe can reduce the above equations Eqs. (2.46)(a) - (2.46)(d) to a single differential\nequation. Decoupling for ?A,\n\n[\n?\n\n?x2\n? x2 + ?2 + ?2\n\n]2\n?A =\n\n[\nt?2(?2 ? ?2) + (1 ? 2??)2\n\n]\n?A. (2.47)\n\nThe solution for the above equation should also satisfy the following ansatz\n[\n? ?\n?x2\n\n+ x2\n]\n?A = ?\u00b1?A, (2.48)\n\nwhere ?\u00b1 = ?2 +?2 \u00b1\n?\nt?2(?2 ? ?2) + (1 ? 2??)2. Assuming ?A(x) = fA(x)e?x\n\n2/2 to solve\n\nEq. (2.48), in order to eliminate the x2, we have that\n\n?2fA\n?x2\n\n? 2x\n?fA\n?x\n\n+ (?\u00b1 ? 1)fA = 0, (2.49)\n\n\n\n2.3.

Comparing the format of Eq. (2.49)\nand Hermite equation, we can see that the eigenvalues obey the relation ?\u00b1 = 2n + 1,\nwhere n is a non-negative integer. After some straightforward algebra, we finally find that\n\nthe discrete spectrum of Landau levels will correspond to the solutions of the following\nfourth-order algebraic equation\n\n[\n(? + ?)2 ? 2(n + 1)\n\n][\n(? ? ?)2 ? 2n\n\n]\n=\n(\n?2 ? ?2\n\n)\nt?2.

For the biased case, we considered the gate\npotentials as being U1 = ?U2 = 100 meV.\n\n2.4 Boundary conditions\n\nAs it has been already demonstrated in the literature [27], the electronic states of\n\nthe carbon systems depend strongly on its size and geometry. For instance, in the case\nof carbon nanotubes, the geometry dependence is strongly influenced by the bipartite\n\ncharacter of the graphene lattice and the wrapping direction imposes different boundary\nconditions on the wave function in the different sublattices, which determine whether the\n\nsystem is semiconducting or metallic [87]. For graphene nanoribbons, Brey &amp; Fertig have\nbeen reported in Refs. [88] and [89] that the electronic energies and states of graphene\n\nnanoribbons with different atomic terminations may be understood in terms of eigenvalues\nand eigenvectors of the Dirac Hamiltonian with correct boundary conditions. They have\nfocused in the two more conventional graphene edges terminations: zigzag and armchair\n\nedges, as illustrated in Fig. 2.7(a). Akhmerov &amp; Beenakker have derived in Ref. [90]\nthe boundary condition for the Dirac equation corresponding to a tight-binding model on\n\ntwo-dimensional honeycomb lattice terminated along an arbitrary direction. They have\nshown that the boundary condition for intermediate case (a mixed boundary condition)\n\nremains orientations of the zigzag form, so that the armchair boundary condition is only\nreached for a discrete set of orientations.\n\nzi\ng\nza\n\ng\n e\n\nd\ng\ne\n\narmchair edge\n\narmchair edge\n\nzi\ng\nza\n\ng\n e\n\nd\ng\ne\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nx\n\ny\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nA\n\nB\n\nB\n\nA-B\n\nB-A\n\nA-B\n\nA-B\n\nB-A\n\nB-A\n30\n\nosublattice A\nsublattice B\n\n150\no\n\n60\no\n\n90\no\n\n120\no\n\n0\no\n\nFigure 2.7: (a) The lattice structure of a graphene sheet denoting the zigzag and armchair\ntype edge terminations.

(b) In the zigzag case, each edge is built from atoms of one sublattice only.\nFollowing the dashed green lines forming a regular zigzag hexagon, one notice that the\nsublattice switches at every side. (c) In the armchair case, both sublattices are present at\n\neach edge forming dimer with A?B or B ? A termination with respect to the tangential\ndirection.\n\n\n\n2.4. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS 80\n\nOther important topic in the understanding of the boundary conditions is related\n\nto electron confinement in nanostructured systems. It is known that in conventional\ntwo-dimensional electron gases, as realized in semiconductor heterostructures, the charge\ncarriers can be confined by the application of side or top gate voltages, such that these\n\nvoltages shift the Fermi energy locally from the conduction or valence band into the gap\nof the spectrum. This can be achieved by defining an effective system boundary where\n\nelectrons are reflected from, and hence are confined. In the same way, the importance in\nthe studying of the boundary conditions in graphene nanostructures lies in the possibility\n\nof confining carriers. Electrostatic potentials do, however, not necessarily confine massless\nDirac electrons in graphene, as their corresponding energy spectrum does not have a\n\ngap. Instead, the Fermi energy can only be shifted from the conduction band into the\nvalence band or vice versa, such that electrons can be transmitted into the gated region.\n\nIt is due to well-known Klein tunneling [1], in which under normal incidence a perfect\ntransmission is allowed. Because of this (partial) transparency of electrostatic barriers for\ncharge carriers in graphene, electrons and holes in graphene nanostructures or flakes are\n\nexpected to scatter only from the edges that eventually terminate the graphene lattice\n[91].\n\nSince the physical properties of a carbon system are affected by its format and edge\nterminations, we investigate in the following three subsections how are the boundary\n\nconditions depending on the crystallographic orientation of the boundary and how to\nimplement it in the continuum model in a appropriate way. We focus our attention only on\n\nthe simplest and the most commonly considered boundary conditions for graphene formed\nby zigzag edges, armchair edges and with infinite-mass term outside of the confinement\n\nstructure, described in the effective Dirac Hamiltonian.\nBefore presenting the appropriated boundary conditions for each edge termination, we\n\nshall briefly derive the effective 4 \u00d7 4 Hamiltonian to describe the quasiparticle dynamics\nin graphene at low energies, i. e. close to the two inequivalent K and K? Dirac points,\nbeing the Hamiltonian for each valley given by Eq. (2.15). Thus, the Hamiltonian for\n\nmassless Dirac fermions can be written as\n\nH =\n\n(\nHK 0\n\n0 HK?\n\n)\n, (2.52)\n\nwhere HK (HK?) is the 2 \u00d7 2 Hamiltonian in the K (K?) valley, which are given by\n\nHK = vf~? \u00b7 ~p and HK? = vf ~?? \u00b7 ~p, (2.53)\n\nwith ~? = (?x,?y) being the Pauli matrices and ~?? = (?x,?y) denotes the complex conju-\n\ngate of the matrix ~?.\nThe wave functions can be expressed via the ~k \u00b7 ~p approximation, in terms of enve-\n\nlope functions [?A(~r),?B(~r)] and [?A?(~r),?B?(~r)] for states near the K and K? points,\nrespectively. These states can be conveniently combined into a four-vector ?(~r) =\n\n\n\n2.4. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS 81\n\n[?A(~r),?B(~r),?A?(~r),?B?(~r)]. Thus, we can write the wave function in the real space\n\nfor the sublattice A as\n?A(~r) = e\n\ni ~K\u00b7~r?A(~r) + e\ni ~K?\u00b7~r?A?(~r), (2.54)\n\nand for sublattice B as\n\n?B(~r) = e\ni ~K\u00b7~r?B(~r) + e\n\ni ~K?\u00b7~r?B?(~r), (2.55)\n\nwith ~K and ~K? given by Eq. (2.11).\n\n2.4.1 Zigzag boundary condition\n\nLet us consider the orientation of the lattice structure of a graphene sheet as presented\n\nin Fig. 2.7(a). We have that the resulting type termination are zigzag edges when the\ngraphene lattice is terminated along a line including the angles given by 30o, 90o and\n\n150o with respect to the x-axis, as demonstrated in Fig. 2.7(b). As one can notice,\nthe outermost row of atoms under the green dashed lines that surrounds the hexagon\ncontains solely atoms of either A? or B?type, such that the orientation of the edge\ndetermines the sublattice. Let us assume that a piece of graphene has a zigzag edge along\nthe boundary curve denoted by s with ~r = ~rB(s). If the last atoms at the boundary\n\nare from sublattice B, then the microscopic boundary condition is that the tight-binding\nwave function vanishes on the (missing) A-type sites of the outermost atoms, which we\n\nunderstand as being the line of lattice sites that would lie just above or below the system\nif the bonds had not been cut to form the edge. Then the boundary condition reads\n\n?A(~rB(s)) = ?A?(~rB(s)) = 0 (2.56)\n\nwith the wave function set to zero on a single sublattice, while ?B and ?B? are not\n\ndetermined and not directly affected by the boundary condition. Actually, since the\neffective Dirac equation couples the sublattice when we solve H? = E?, we have therefore\n\nthat ?B and ?B? are affected indirectly. Similarly, when the zigzag edges are terminated\nby the A atoms, one has in this case that ?B and ?B? have to vanish individually, whereas\n\n?A and ?A? are not determined.\nIn summary, the correct boundary condition for zigzag edges requires the wave function\n\nto vanish on a single sublattice at each edge. In addition, it has been shown in Ref. [88]\nthat there are surface states strongly localized near the edges which are non-vanishing\n\nonly on a single sublattice. These states are called as zigzag edge states. They exist for\nvery low energies and present an exponential decay of the wave function away from the\nedge.\n\n2.4.2 Armchair boundary condition\n\nFor the considered lattice orientation as illustrated in Fig. 2.7(a), we have that the\narmchair edge is achieved when the terminations of the atoms lie along the one of the\n\n\n\n2.4. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS 82\n\ngreen dashed lines that surround the hexagon. This type of termination is obtained for\n\nthe angle positions given by 0o, 60o and 120o with respect to the x-axis, as depicted in Fig.\n2.7(c). This means that every armchair orientation lies exactly between two successive\nzigzag orientations and vice versa. Note that in the case of armchair boundaries the\n\nnumber of carbon atoms in each side is an even number. In contrast to the zigzag case,\nnow both sublattices are present at an armchair edge; more precisely, the edge atoms\n\nconsist of a line of A ? B dimers, with one A? and one B?atom each. Therefore, as\na natural consequence, the boundary condition is that the tight-binding wave function\n\namplitude have to vanish on both sublattices (A? and B? wave function components\nshould be zero). From Eqs. (2.54) and (2.55) for ?A = 0 and ?B = 0, the armchair\n\nboundary conditions become\n\n?A(~rB(s)) = ?ei(\n~K?? ~K)\u00b7~rB?A?(~rB(s)), (2.57a)\n\n?B(~rB(s)) = ?ei(\n~K?? ~K)\u00b7~rB?B?(~rB(s)), (2.57b)\n\nwhere ~r is taken at the position of the edge ~rB.\n\nNotice that this relates the contributions from both K and K? points to each other,\nin other words, the armchair edge does couple the valleys, mixing the wave functions in\n\nK and K? Dirac points.\n\n2.4.3 Infinite-mass boundary condition\n\nAs it was presented in previous subsections, the boundary conditions for zigzag and\n\narmchair type edges are derived from microscopic lattice termination for an abruptly\nterminated boundary due to the cutting atoms from the system. On the other hand, we\n\ncan also think about a new type of boundary in such way that Dirac electrons can be\nconfined by means of a potential. It is well known that semiconductor nanostructures, like\n\nquantum dots, rings and wires, are realized by using scalar potentials that are produced\nby voltage gates. However, for massless Dirac fermions it is in principle not possible to\nconfine them in a restricted region with any configuration of a purely electrostatic (scalar)\n\npotential. As mentioned before, the reason is the lack of a gap in the bulk band structure\nand the resulting Klein tunneling.\n\nA confining structure can be obtained by gap opening. This requires a violation of\nthe equivalence of the sublattices. Therefore, if instead of a scalar potential V (x,y) we\n\nconsider a potential in a form\n\nm(x,y) = ?M(x,y)?z, (2.58)\n\nwhich has a different sign on each of the two sublattices due to the Pauli matirz ?z,\nwhere ? = 1(?1) for the K (K?) Dirac point, the energy spectrum indeed has a gap\nwherever m(x,y) is non-zero. Physically, such a staggered potential can result from\ncertain substrates, like boron nitride (h-BN) and SiC, that couple differently to A and\n\n\n\n2.4. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS 83\n\nB sites [78, 92], i. e. this term represents a difference of potential energy between the\n\nA and B sites7. Considering the most simple case for a constant staggered potential,\nsuch as M(x,y) = ? = constant, then we have that the Hamiltonian (2.16) can be easly\ndiagonalized resulting in the following energy spectrum, given by\n\nE(~k) = \u00b1\n?\n\n~2v2Fk\n2 + ?2. (2.59)\n\nOne can notice that the above spectrum describe massive Dirac particles with a rest mass\n\nof ?. This is the reason why this kind of potential, as described by Eq. (2.58), is called\nmass term or mass potential. Note that the including of this staggered potential leads to\n\na gap of 2|?| in the energy spectrum and, consequently, opens the possibility of its usage\nto effectively confine Dirac particles.\n\nLet us now consider a surface S with outward unit normal vector ~n as shown in Fig.\n2.8 to deal with a more complicated mass term. The infinity-mass boundary condition in\n\na monolayer graphene system is obtained when one considers mass as zero (infinity) inside\n(outside) of the confinement region. This model was developed by Berry &amp; Mondragon\n\neven long before the discovery of graphene in order to describe confined neutrinos using\nthe 2D Dirac equation [93]. Consequently, it is achieved when the local current must be\nsuch that there is no outward current at any point of the surface edge. This condition\n\nreads as\n~n(s) \u00b7 ~u(r) = 0, (2.60)\n\nwhere ~n(s) = (cos?, sin?) and the local current ~u(r) in state ? = [?A,?B]T is defined as\nthe local expectation value of the current operator\n\nu? = ?pH = vF~?. (2.61)\n\nThe above equation can be rewritten after some algebraic manipulations as\n\n~u(r) = vF (?\n?\nA,?\n\n?\nB)~?\n\n(\n?A\n\n?B\n\n)\n= 2vF [?{??A?B}x? + ?{??A?B}y?] . (2.62)\n\nUsing the Eqs. (2.60) and (2.62), and the definition of ~n(s), we have that\n\ncos??{??A?B} + sin??{??A?B} = 0. (2.63)\n\nWe can split the above Eq. (2.63) as\n\ncos ??{??A?B} = ?C sin ? cos?,\nsin ??{??A?B} = C sin? cos ?, (2.64)\n\nleading to ??A?B = iCe\ni?(s). Since that C is an arbitrary constant, we can assume that\n\n??A?B = i?\n?\nA?A?e\n\ni?(s). Therefore, we finally find\n\n?B/?A = i?e\ni?(s), (2.65)\n\n7We have already mentioned briefly at the end of Sec. 2.1 about the staggered mass-related potential\nin Eq. (2.16).\n\n\n\n2.5. SPLIT-OPERATOR METHOD 84\n\nx\ny D = 0\n\nD = 8S\n\na\nn\n\nFigure 2.8: Surface S with an outward unit normal vector ~n used to describe how to\nfind the infinity-mass boundary condition used in order to confine carriers in a monolayer\n\ngraphene. ?(s) is the angle between the outward unit vector at the edges and the x-axis.\n? is the mass-related potential, which it is zero inside the arbitrary graphene quantum\n\ndot and infinity at its edges [93].\n\nthat is the infinity-mass boundary condition for monolayer graphene. Note that this\nboundary condition couples the A and B sublattices and moreover it is not invariant\n\nunder the time-reversal operation [93]. ? is 1(?1) for the K (K?) Dirac point. Due to the\nsimplicity of implementation and possibility of obtaining analytical solutions, this infinite-\n\nmass boundary condition has been used in the study of circular graphene quantum dots\n[77] and rings [94, 95] in the absence and presence of a external perpendicularly magnetic\n\nfield. Other different geometries, as triangular and hexagonal formats, have been already\nreported [96]. It is possible, because when using this infinite-mass boundary condition,\n\nthe Klein tunneling effect at the interface between the internal and external regions of the\nconfinement structure can be avoided and this way charge carriers can be confined.\n\n2.5 Split-operator method\n\nIn the dynamic description of a particle by a Hamiltonian H, ones has the time-\n\ndependence of an initial wave function ?(~r,t0) given by\n\n?(~r,t) = U?(t, t0)?(~r,t0), (2.66)\n\nwhere U?(t, t0) is known as the time evolution operator [97]. For the case in which the\n\nHamiltonian does not depend explicitly of the time [97, 98], we have\n\nU?(t, t0) = exp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n~\nH(t ? t0)\n\n]\n. (2.67)\n\nIn general, the exponential of Hamiltonian operator can not be solved exactly. Besides,\nin order to calculate the exponential of an operator which is given by sum of two or more\n\n\n\n2.5. SPLIT-OPERATOR METHOD 85\n\noperators that do not commute with each other, one can not just rewrite the exponential\n\nas the product of exponentials of these operators, i. e., exp[A? + B?] = exp(A?) exp(B?) if\nand only if [A?,B?] = 0. Therefore, to address this problem, we will use the Split-operator\ntechnique [99, 100, 101, 102], that combines the separation between the Hamiltonian\n\noperators in exponentials that depend only on one of these operators, given by Masuo\nSuzuki [103] as\n\nexp\n\n[\n?\n\nq?\n\nj=1\n\nA?j\n\n]\n= fm(A?1, A?2, A?3, ...., A?q) + O(?m+1), (2.68)\n\nand by the Cayley relation\n\nexp\n[\n?A?\n]\n=\n\n[\n1 ? ?A?\n\n2\n\n]?1 [\n1 +\n\n?A?\n\n2\n\n]\n+ O(?4), (2.69)\n\nwhere O(?m) represents the neglected terms, which have an error of order ?m. The ap-\nproximants functions fm to m = 1 and 2 are:\n\nf1(A?1, A?2) = exp[?A?1] exp[?A?2], (2.70)\n\nf2(A?1, A?2) = exp\n\n[\n?A?1\n2\n\n]\nexp[?A?2] exp\n\n[\n?A?1\n2\n\n]\n, (2.71)\n\nf1(A?1, A?2, A?3) = exp[?A?1] exp[?A?2] exp[?A?3], (2.72)\n\nf2(A?1, A?2, A?3) = exp\n\n[\n?A?1\n2\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n?A?3\n2\n\n]\nexp[?A?2] exp\n\n[\n?A?3\n2\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n?A?1\n2\n\n]\n. (2.73)\n\nApplying this technique to Hamiltonians that do not involve spin, but only the terms\nof kinetic T and potential V energies (H = T +V ), where T and V do not commute with\n\neach other, we find that\n\nexp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n~\nH?t\n\n]\n?= exp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n2~\nV ?t\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n~\nT?t\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n2~\nV ?t\n\n]\n, (2.74)\n\nwhere the terms of O(?t3) order were neglected by considering a small time step ?t. Let\nus now discretize all involved functions in the space in order to implement this compu-\n\ntationally (the potential Vi and the wave function ?i). In this manner, we can multiply\npoint-by-point the terms of the potential energy with the wave function, obtaining\n\n?i(ri, t + ?t) = exp\n\n[\n? i\n2~\nVi?t\n\n]\n?i(ri, t). (2.75)\n\nHaving ?i, the next step is to perform an operation involving kinetic energy term, to then\n\nobtain a new function ?i. To do this, maybe the most accessible way should be to take a\nFourier transform of ?i, bringing this function to reciprocal space. But in fact, the most\n\nconvenient one is to use Cayley form, Eq. (2.69), obtaining\n(\n1 +\n\ni\n\n2~\nT?t\n\n)\n?i =\n\n(\n1 ? i\n\n2~\nT?t\n\n)\n?i, (2.76)\n\n\n\n2.5. SPLIT-OPERATOR METHOD 86\n\nand then to discretize the derivatives of kinetic term by Crank-Nicolson form [104]. The\n\nresulting problem becomes a tridiagonal matrix equation that can be solved numerically\nthrough the TRIDAG subroutine [104]. Now, having in hands the ?i\u2019s, then we can again\nmultiply point-by-point the exponential that has the potential term, by the column matrix\n\nof the ?i\u2019s.\nTherefore, for problems with more than one dimension, one has just products of tridi-\n\nagonal matrices, once that the potential energy terms can be directly multiplied and the\ntotal kinetic energy term can be divided into the product of exponential terms of its com-\n\nponents. Performing this procedure several times in increments of ?t, we obtain the time\nevolution of the wave function for a particular proposed system.\n\nThis technique is computationally easy to apply and has been widely used in studies\nof wave packet propagation in semiconductor [105] and extended to the case of graphene\n\nstructures by A. Chaves et al. [106]. We shall show briefly in the following sections the\nexpansion of this technique for the Tight-binding and Dirac Hamiltonians.\n\n2.5.1 Tight-binding Hamiltonian\n\nA simple mathematical approach that has all the important aspects for the description\n\nof a lattice of atoms is known as Kronig-Penney model [107, 108, 109]. In this model,\none approaches the potential of the crystal by a succession of rectangular potential wells\n\nand barriers with a periodicity that is identical to the lattice. Each well is this way an\napproximate representation of the potential produced by an ion.\n\nFor a one-dimensional lattice, we have that the periodic potential is formed as being\n\nmany one-dimensional potential wells equally spaced. If the wells are infinitely deep, a\nparticle would be completely located in one of the wells. Assuming that the particle is\n\nlocated in the i-th well, denoting the state by |?i?, then |?i? is an eigenstate of the system\nwith eigenvalue E0, such that H|?i? = E0|?i?. As all the potential wells are identical\nand do not interact with each other, they all have the same energy values. Therefore E0\nwould be an infinitely degenerate state. Otherwise, if the wells are finite, then the system\n\neigenstate will be a linear combination of all |?i?\u2019s, because, since the barriers are finite,\nthe particles have a finite tunneling probability. By completely neglecting the elements\n\nof H which are related to distant wells and just considering the influence of the nearest\nneighbors, we obtain the approximation known as tight-binding [97], i. e.\n\n??j|H|?i? 6= 0, only if j = i or j = i \u00b1 1, (2.77)\n\nand\n\n??i\u00b11|H|?i? = ?i,i\u00b11, (2.78)\n\nwhere ?i (the hopping parameter) is the binding energy of the electron between the wells\n\ni and j. In this way, one obtains\n\nH|?i? ?= ?i?1|?i?1? + E0|?i? + ?i+1|?i+1?. (2.79)\n\n\n\n2.5. SPLIT-OPERATOR METHOD 87\n\nLet us now expand the tight-binding model for the description of a two-dimensional\n\ncrystal. To do this, we will consider respectively i and j as the row and column indexes\nto locate a particular site in the lattice. So, one finds that\n\nH|?i,j? ?= (E0 + Vi,j)|?i,j? + ?i?1,j|?i?1,j? + ?i+1,j|?i+1,j? + ?i,j?1|?i,j?1? + ?i,j+1|?i,j+1?.\n(2.80)\n\nOutlining the Hamiltonian obtained from one-dimensional and two-dimensional lattice\nin matrix form, we see that they will be represented by tridiagonal and pentadiagonal ma-\n\ntrices in blocks, respectively. Thus, one can see the importance of using the Split-Operator\ntechnique in the numerical simplification of the problem for the case of graphene, since\n\nthis structure is a two-dimensional crystal, which now can be dealt only with tridiagonal\nmatrices, thus avoiding pentadiagonal matrices.\n\nFinally, let us now develop the Split-operator method for systems described by tight-\nbinding Hamiltonians in two dimensions. According to the procedure developed at the\n\nbeginning of this section, we shall split the Hamiltonian to transform the problem of\na pentadiagonal matrix in blocks to one problem involving only products of tridiagonal\nmatrices, so that we can rewrite the Eq. (2.80) as follows\n\nH|?i,j? = Hi|?i,j? + Hj|?i,j?, (2.81)\n\nwhere the operators Hi and Hj are defined as\n\nHi|?i,j? =\n(\nE0 + Vi,j\n\n2\n\n)\n|?i,j? + ?i,j?1|?i,j?1? + ?i,j+1|?i,j+1? (2.82)\n\nand\n\nHj|?i,j? =\n(\nE0 + Vi,j\n\n2\n\n)\n|?i,j? + ?i?1,j|?i?1,j? + ?i+1,j|?i+1,j?. (2.83)\n\nRewriting the time evolution operator in the same way as done in Eq. (2.74), we have\n\nthat\n\nexp\n\n[\n? i\n~\nH?t\n\n]\n= exp\n\n[\n? i\n2~\nHj?t\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n? i\n~\nHi?t\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n? i\n2~\nHj?t\n\n]\n+ O(?t3). (2.84)\n\nThe wave function at time step t + ?t is then given by\n\n|?i,j?t+?t ?= exp\n[\n?\ni\n\n2~\nHj?t\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n~\nHi?t\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n2~\nHj?t\n\n]\n|?i,j?t, (2.85)\n\nwhich can be developed in three steps\n\n?i,j = exp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n2~\nHj?t\n\n]\n|?i,j?t, (2.86)\n\n?i,j = exp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n~\nHi?t\n\n]\n?i,j, (2.87)\n\n|?i,j?t+?t = exp\n[\n? i\n2~\nHj?t\n\n]\n?i,j, (2.88)\n\n\n\n2.5. SPLIT-OPERATOR METHOD 88\n\nwhere on the intersection of each step we will use the Cayley equation (Eq. (2.69))\n(\n1 +\n\ni\n\n4~\nHj?t\n\n)\n?i, j =\n\n(\n1 ? i\n\n4~\nHj?t\n\n)\n|?i,j?t, (2.89)\n\n(\n1 +\n\ni\n\n4~\nHi?t\n\n)\n?i, j =\n\n(\n1 ? i\n\n4~\nHi?t\n\n)\n?i, j, (2.90)\n\n(\n1 +\n\ni\n\n4~\nHj?t\n\n)\n|?i,j?t+?t =\n\n(\n1 ? i\n\n4~\nHj?t\n\n)\n?i, j. (2.91)\n\nThus, as already mentioned, the problem becomes simpler because now we should deal\nonly with tridiagonal matrices.\n\n2.5.2 Dirac Hamiltonian\n\nAs already presented earlier in section 2.1, the Dirac Hamiltonian, which describes the\n\nlow-energy electronic states near the Dirac points (K and K?) as massless Dirac fermions,\nis described by a Hamiltonian given in terms of Pauli matrices ~?i as given by Eq. (2.15),\n\nand in a more general way by Eq. (2.16).\nThe kinetic part of the Dirac Hamiltonian belongs to a special class of Hamiltonians\n\nthat depend on the Pauli matrices in the form\n\nH = ~S \u00b7 ~?. (2.92)\n\nThe main idea in this case to implement the Split-operator technique is split HD into two\nterms such that, one of them should depend only on the coordinates of the real space,\n\nwhereas the other should contains reciprocal space terms. Thus, for the more general\nHamiltonian (2.16) we shall divide HD in Hk, that has terms that depend only on the\n\nwave vector k, and in Hr, that contains only terms of real space coordinates, respectively\ngiven by:\n\nHk = ~vf~? \u00b7 ~k, (2.93)\n\nand\n\nHr = ?vfe~? \u00b7 ~A + V I + M?z. (2.94)\n\nHowever, rewriting the time evolution operator for the Hamiltonian HD and perform-\ning the same procedure as done in Eqs. (2.74) and (7.7), we obtain\n\nexp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n~\nHD?t\n\n]\n= exp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n2~\nHr?t\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n~\nHk?t\n\n]\nexp\n\n[\n?\ni\n\n2~\nHr?t\n\n]\n+ O(?t3), (2.95)\n\nsince Hk and Hr do not commute. Expanding each term in the exponential form\n\nexp\n[\n?i~S \u00b7 ~?\n\n]\n=\n?\n\nn\n\n(?i~S \u00b7 ~?)n\nn!\n\n=\n?\n\nk\n\n(?1)k(~S \u00b7 ~?)2k\n2k!\n\n? i\n?\n\nk\n\n(?1)k(~S \u00b7 ~?)2k+1\n(2k + 1)!\n\n, (2.96)\n\nand using the following properties of Pauli matrices\n\n?i?j = I [?i,?j] = 0, (2.97)\n\n\n\n2.5. SPLIT-OPERATOR METHOD 89\n\nit readily easy to see that\n\n(~S \u00b7 ~?)2k = S2kI (~S \u00b7 ~?)2k+1 = S2k(~S \u00b7 ~?). (2.98)\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite the expansion of the exponential, Eq. (2.96), in the form\n\nexp\n[\n?i~S \u00b7 ~?\n\n]\n=\n\n(\ncos(S) 0\n\n0 cos(S)\n\n)\n? isin(S)\n\nS\n\n(\nSz Sx ? iSy\n\nSx + iSy ?Sz\n\n)\n. (2.99)\n\nUsing the above expression for each exponential term of Eq. (2.95), it yields\n\nMr = exp\n[\n?\ni\n\n2~\nHr?t\n\n]\n=\n\n(\ncos(?) 0\n\n0 cos(?)\n\n)\n? i\n\nsin(?)\n\n?\n\n(\nM Ax ? iAy\n\nAx + iAy ?M\n\n)\ne?\n\ni\n2~\n\nV ?t\n\n(2.100)\n\nMk = exp\n[\n?\ni\n\n2~\nHk?t\n\n]\n=\n\n(\ncos(?) 0\n\n0 cos(?)\n\n)\n? i\n\nsin(?)\n\n?\n\n(\n0 ?x ? i?y\n\n?x + i?y 0\n\n)\n, (2.101)\n\nwhere ? = |~?| = ?tvf|~k|, ? = |~?| = |(Ax,Ay,M)|, ~A = ?tvfe~A/2~ and M = ?tM/2~ are\ndimensionless units.\n\nFinally, we can obtain the expression for the time evolution of the wave packet\n?D(x,y) = [?A,?B]\n\nT ?(x,y). As you can see, it is computed simply through matrix\n\nmultiplications\n?(~r,t + ?t) = Mr \u00b7 Mk \u00b7 Mr?(~r,t) + O(?t3). (2.102)\n\nIn the matrix multiplication of the term Mk, one must perform a Fourier transform of\nthe functions in order to take the system in the reciprocal space.\n\n\n\n3\nGeometry and edge effects on the energy levels of\n\ngraphene quantum rings a comparison between\n\ntight-binding and simplified Dirac models\n\nWe present a systematic study of the energy spectra of graphene quantum rings having\ndifferent geometries and edge types, in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field.\n\nResults are obtained within the tight-binding (TB) and Dirac models and we discuss\nwhich features of the former can be recovered by using the approximations imposed by\n\nthe latter. Energy levels of graphene quantum rings obtained by diagonalizing the TB\nHamiltonian are demonstrated to be strongly dependent on the rings geometry and the\n\nmicroscopical structure of the edges. This makes it difficult to recover those spectra by the\nexisting theories that are based on the continuum (Dirac) model. Nevertheless, our results\n\nshow that both approaches (i. e. TB and Dirac model) may provide similar results, but\nonly for very specific combinations of ring geometry and edge types. The results obtained\n\nby a simplified model describing an infinitely thin circular Dirac ring show good agreement\nwith those obtained for hexagonal and rhombus armchair graphene rings within the TB\n\nmodel. Moreover, we show that the energy levels of a circular quantum ring with an\ninfinite mass boundary condition obtained within the Dirac model agree with those for a\nring defined by a ring-shaped staggered potential obtained within the TB model.\n\n3.1 Motivation\n\nGraphene, a two-dimensional lattice of carbon atoms [18], has been a subject of great\ninterest during the past few years. This interest is not only due to its possible future\n\ntechnological applications, but also because it provides the possibility to probe interesting\nphenomena predicted by quantum field theories. Several of the exotic properties originate\n\nfrom the fact that low energy electrons in graphene obey the zero mass Dirac equation.\n(for a review, see e. g. Ref. [1])\n\nPrevious works have demonstrated interesting features coming from ring- and dot-\nlike confinement in graphene.[96, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115] Theoretical studies have\n\n\n\n3.1. MOTIVATION 91\n\npredicted Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in both the conductance [116] and the energy\n\nspectrum [117] of graphene quantum rings. In fact, AB conductance oscillations were\nobserved in recent experiments on several circular rings fabricated in few-layer graphene.\n[118] Luo et al. [119] demonstrated theoretically that the energy spectrum of armchair\n\nquantum rings exhibits signatures of an effective time-reversal symmetry breaking, where\na gap around zero energy, which can be removed by applying an external magnetic field,\n\nis observed.\nFrom the point of view of the continuum model, where electrons are described as\n\nmassless Dirac fermions, several models have been suggested for studying the confined\nstates of graphene quantum rings. For instance, Recher et al. [94] have used the Dirac\n\nmodel to show that the combined effects of a ring shaped mass-related potential and an\nexternal magnetic field can be used to break the valley degeneracy in graphene. A similar\n\neffect was also found by Wurm et al. [120], where it was theoretically demonstrated\nthat the splitting of the valley degeneracy by a magnetic field in such a system can\nalso be observed in the transport properties of rings that are weakly coupled to leads.\n\nThe analytical solution for the graphene ring proposed in Ref. [94] was used latter by\nAbergel et al. [95] to study the interplay between valley polarization and electron-electron\n\ninteractions on some measurable quantities in such a structure, where they observe, e. g.,\nextra steps in the persistent current as a function of an external magnetic field. A recent\n\npaper [121] proposed a simplified model for obtaining energy levels in graphene quantum\nrings, based on an idea widely used for semiconductor quantum rings, [122] where the\n\nradial component of the momentum of the confined particle is assumed to be zero, so that\nthe effective Hamiltonian of the system depends only on the angular coordinate. This\n\nmodel has been recently used, e. g. for the study of wave packet revivals in monolayer\nand bilayer graphene rings. [123]\n\nNotice that the continuum model for graphene is developed by considering a peri-\n\nodic honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms of infinite size and by analysing only the low\nenergy sector of the corresponding tight-binding Hamiltonian. However, the experimen-\n\ntally obtained graphene quantum rings reported in the literature are normally fabricated\nby cutting out the graphene flake into a finite size ring shaped structure. In order to\n\ntake the finite size effects into account within the Dirac theory, the above mentioned\nprevious papers have usually considered either infinite mass boundary conditions, or a\n\n\u201cfrozen\u201d radial motion of the particles. But it is questionable that these conditions are\nreally sufficient in order to describe a real graphene ring sample. If so, what are the\n\nlimits of such approximations? Answering these questions is the main purpose of this\npaper, where we use the tight-binding model (TBM) to calculate the energy spectrum of\n\ngraphene quantum rings with different geometries and different type of edges. We then\ndiscuss the main qualitative features of the obtained spectra in terms of the continuum\n(Dirac) approximation, making a comparison between the results obtained by such an ap-\n\nproximation and those obtained by the TBM.

TIGHT-BINDING MODEL 92\n\nshow that the energy spectra of these systems strongly depend on the detailed structure\n\nof the edges, which makes it difficult to find analytical solutions for the energy states in\nthese systems within the continuum model. Circular rings cut out of a graphene sheet\nexhibit mixed armchair and zigzag edges, and the latter leads to strongly confined edge\n\nstates, which significantly affects its energy spectrum. The AB oscillations in the energy\nspectra for other geometries of quantum rings, where one can obtain uniform edge type,\n\nexhibit geometry-specific n-fold energy sub-bands, and in some cases, the qualitative fea-\ntures of the spectrum are shown to depend even on the alignment between inner and\n\nouter edges of the ring. Even so, we demonstrate that under specific conditions, one can\nstill use the proposed simplified model [121] to obtain analytically the main qualitative\n\nfeatures of the energy spectra of armchair rings, or use the analytical solution proposed\nin Ref. [94] to observe some features exhibited by the energy spectrum obtained by the\n\ntight-binding model for a mass-related ring confinement, as we will discuss in further\ndetail in the following sections.\n\nThe present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 3.2 we briefly present an outline\n\nof the TBM and the investigated graphene rings. An approximate analytical solution is\nobtained for a simplified model within the Dirac approach in Sec. 3.3. Our numerical\n\nresults from TBM and the analytical ones from the simplified Dirac model are shown in\nSec. 3.5. A summary and concluding remarks are reported in Sec. 3.5.\n\n3.2 Tight-Binding model\n\nGraphene consists of a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms, which can be described by\nthe Hamiltonian\n\nHTB =\n?\n\ni\n\n(?i + Mi)c\n\u2020\nici +\n\n?\n\n<i,j>\n\n(\n?ijc\n\n\u2020\nicj + ?\n\n?\nijcic\n\n\u2020\nj\n\n)\n, (3.1)\n\nwhere ci(c\n\u2020\ni ) annihilates (creates) an electron in site i, with on-site energy ?i, and the sum\n\nis taken only between the nearest neighbors sites i and j, with hopping energy ?ij. Due\n\nto the Klein tunnelling effect in graphene, it is hard to confine electrons by applying an\nexternal potential. [124, 125] On the other hand, a staggered site-dependent potential Mi,\nwhich is positive (negative) if i belongs to the sublattice A (B), [126] opens a gap in the\n\nenergy spectrum of graphene. Due to this property, such a potential is normally used to\nsimulate confining structures in graphene, such as quantum dots [77] and rings [94], within\n\nthe Dirac model, where it appears as a mass-related term. Recent papers have suggested a\nway to realize such a potential experimentally, namely, by depositing the graphene lattice\n\nover specific substrates. [78, 92, 127] The effect of an external magnetic field can be\nintroduced in the TB model by including a phase in the hopping parameters according\n\nto the Peierls substitution ?ij ? ?ij exp\n[\nie\n~\n\n? i\nj\n~A \u00b7 d~l\n\n]\n, where ~A is the vector potential\n\ndescribing the magnetic field.

CONTINUUM MODEL 94\n\n~B = Bz?, we conveniently choose the Landau gauge ~A = (0,Bx, 0), so that the Peierls\n\nphase becomes zero in the x-direction and exp\n[\ni2?x\n3a\n\n?\n?0\n\n]\nin the y-direction, where a = 1.42\n\n\u00c5 is the lattice parameter of graphene, ?0 = h/e is the magnetic quantum flux and\n? = 3\n\n?\n3a2B/2 is the magnetic flux through a carbon hexagon.\n\nWe write the Hamiltonian (3.1) in matrix form, diagonalize it numerically and obtain\nthe energy spectrum for the different ring geometries schematically shown in Fig. 1:\n\nhexagonal, triangular and rhombus-shaped rings, with (a, c, e) armchair and (b, d, f)\nzigzag edges. We also consider circular rings defined by cutting the graphene lattice (g),\n\nor by considering a circular-shaped staggered potential (h). The edges of such circular\nrings exhibit an admixture of zigzag and armchair regions and are not singly defined. The\nring-shaped staggered potential in Fig. 1(h) is given by\n\nMi(ri) = \u00b1M0[2 + tanh\n(\nr+i\n)\n+ tanh\n\n(\nr?i\n)\n] (3.2)\n\nwhere r+i = (ri ? R ? W/2)/S and r?i = (?ri + R ? W/2)/S, S is the width of the\nsmooth region and ri =\n\n?\nx2i + y\n\n2\nj is the position of the i-th site of the lattice. Such a\n\nstaggered potential goes smoothly to zero (M0) inside (outside) the ring region, avoiding\nedge-related effects.\n\nProbability density currents within the TB model are numerically calculated based on\n\nthe method developed in Ref. [130], where one defines the probability current ~j in terms\nof the continuity equation and, after some calculations, obtain the current components in\n\nx and y directions for each site, which is defined by its line (n) and column (m) position\nin the lattice (see Ref. [131]), as\n\njx(n,m) = \u00b1\na\n\n~\n\n{\n2?\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn,m\u00b11?n,m\u00b11\n\n]\n\n??\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn?1,m?n?1,m\n\n]\n? ?\n\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn+1,m?n+1,m\n\n]}\n(3.3)\n\nand\n\njy(n,m) =\n\n?\n3a\n\n~\n\n{\n?\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn+1,m?n+1,m\n\n]\n\n??\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn?1,m?n?1,m\n\n]}\n(3.4)\n\nwhere the ? sign in jx will be positive (negative) if the (n,m)-site belongs to the sublattice\nA (B), and ?n,m is the hopping parameter which, in the presence of a magnetic field,\n\nincludes an additional phase according to the Peierls substitution.\n\n3.3 Continuum model\n\nThe energy spectrum of an infinite graphene sheet in the absence of external potentials\nand magnetic field, as obtained from the TBM Hamiltonian (3.1), is gapless in six points\n\nof the reciprocal space, from which only two are inequivalent, labelled as K and K?.\n\n\n\n3.3. CONTINUUM MODEL 95\n\n[1, 132] In the vicinity of each of these points, the energy depends linearly on the wave\n\nvector ~k and the electron behaves as a quasi-particle described by the Dirac Hamiltonian\n\nHD =\n[\nvF~? \u00b7 (~p + e~A) + V (~r)I + ?M(~r)?z\n\n]\n, (3.5)\n\nwhere vF = 3?a0/2~ is the Fermi velocity, ~A is the electromagnetic vector potential,\n\nV (x,y) is an external potential, I is the identity matrix and ~?i denotes the components\nof the Pauli matrices. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (3.5) are the two-component\n\nspinors ? = [?A, ?B]T , where ?A(B) are the envelop functions associated with the electron\nprobabilities in A(B) sublattices.\n\nThe site-dependent staggered potential Mi in the TB Hamiltonian (3.1) contributes\nto the Dirac Hamiltonian as a mass-related potential M(~r), which is multiplied by a\nfactor ? = 1 (-1) for the K (K?) Dirac point in Eq. (3.5). Considering the mass as zero\n\n(infinity) inside (outside) of the confinement region yields the infinity-mass boundary\ncondition ?B(~r)/?A(~r) = i?ei?, where ? is the angle between the outward unit vector at\n\nthe boundaries and ~r (i. e. ? = 0 (? = ?) at outer (inner) boundaries of the ring). [93]\nLet us now consider a simplified model of a circular graphene ring in order to find an\n\napproximate analytical solution for the energy spectrum of graphene quantum rings that\nagrees with those obtained within the TBM. In the absence of an external potential and\n\naround the K point (? = 1), [133] the Hamiltonian (3.5) in polar coordinates reads\n\nHD = ~vF\n\n?\n?\n\nM\n~vF\n\n?i\n(\n??r + e\n\n?i? ?rB\n?0\n\n)\n\n?i\n(\n?r ? ei? ?rB?0\n\n)\n? M\n\n~vF\n\n?\n? , (3.6)\n\nwhere ?r = ei?\n(\n\n?\n?r\n\n+ i\nr\n\n?\n??\n\n)\n. We assume that the width of the ring approaches zero and\n\ntherefore the momentum should be frozen in the radial direction. From the definition of\nthe radial momentum operator [134] in cylindrical coordinates\n\npr =\n1\n\n2\n(pr \u00b7 r? + r? \u00b7 pr) =\n\n?\n\n?r\n+\n\n1\n\n2R\n, (3.7)\n\nwhere r? is the unitary vector in the radial direction and R is the ring radius, we obtain\n?/?r ? ?1\n\n/\n2R, as p?r ? 0 and r ? R. Then, the simplified Hamiltonian for the graphene\n\nquantum ring is\n\nHD =\n\n?\n?\n\nM? ?e?i?\n(\n\nd\nd?\n\n+ i?R\n?0\n\n? i\n2\n\n)\n\nei?\n(\n\nd\nd?\n\n+ i?R\n?0\n\n+ i\n2\n\n)\n-M?\n\n?\n? , (3.8)\n\nwhere ?R = ?R2B is the magnetic flux through the quantum ring, the energy is in units\n\nof E0 = ~vF/R and M? = M/E0.\nNotice that the definition of the radial momentum in Eq. (3.7) was first used by Aronov\n\nand Lyanda-Geller [135] in 1993 for the study of Schr\u00f6dinger electrons in a quantum\nring with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. [1] However, they mistakenly defined the radial\n\n\n\n3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 96\n\nmomentum as pr =\n?\n?r\n\n, which leads to ?\n?r\n\n? 0 as the radial momentum approaches\nzero. Due to this wrong assumption, they ended up with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian\nfor this system. The non-Hermiticity of this Hamiltonian was eliminated artificially in\nsub-sequent papers, [136, 137] by assuming an additional term ?1\n\n/\n2R in the off-diagonals\n\nof the Hamiltonian. A physical explanation for such a term was given almost ten years\nlater in a work by Meijer et al. [122], where the authors split the Hamiltonian into two\n\nparts, one for the radial confinement and the other for the Rashba interaction, and used\nthe eigenfunctions of the radial part to show that the average value of the radial first\n\nderivative term in the Rashba Hamiltonian is ??/?r? = ?1\n/\n2R. However, this is not\n\nthe most general way to explain this term and such an explanation does not help for\n\nthe graphene ring Hamiltonian (3.6), since in this case we cannot split the Hamiltonian\nand obtain a separate radial confinement term. Using Eq. (3.7), on the other hand,\n\none obtains the result found by Meijer et al. in a more natural way, showing that the\nidentity ??/?r? = ?1\n\n/\n2R is actually a consequence of the zero radial momentum. Our\n\nderivation of the graphene ring Hamiltonian in Eqs. (3.6-6.6) shows that if one simply\n\ndefines the radial momentum properly, the correct expression for the radial derivatives\nand, consequently, an Hermitian Hamiltonian will appear naturally from the derivation. It\n\nis straightforwardly seen that the same happens in the derivation of the Rashba interaction\nHamiltonian for quantum rings.\n\nThe eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (6.6) are found as ?l = [Aleil?, iBlei(l+1)?]T , with\neigenenergies\n\nE = \u00b1\n?(\n\nl +\n?R\n?0\n\n+ 1\n\n)(\nl +\n\n?R\n?0\n\n)\n+\n\n1\n\n4\n+ M?2, (3.9)\n\nwhere l is the angular momentum index.\n\n3.4 Results and discussion\n\n3.4.1 Comparison between tight-binding and Dirac models\n\nFirstly, let us investigate the energy spectrum of graphene quantum rings, with various\n\nshapes and edge types, obtained by the TBM, focusing on the search for energy spectra\nthat can be satisfactorily described by the continuum model. With this purpose, we first\n\ndemonstrate that for a rhombus-shaped ring with armchair edges, a strong dependence\nof the energy spectrum on the edge alignment is observed in Fig. 3.2 for NE = 17,\nconsidering NI = 12 (a), where the inner and outer edges are anti-aligned, and NI = 11\n\n(b), where the edges are aligned. In the former case, one obtains very regular oscillations\nas the magnetic field increases, for a wide range of energies. High and irregular energy\n\ndifferences between the excited states are found in the latter (aligned) case, as compared\nto the smaller and more regular separations between energies of the eigenstates of the\n\nsystem with anti-aligned edges. In both cases, the spectrum exhibits two-fold bands of\n\n\n\n3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 97\n\noscillating energies, separated by anti-crossings, even in the higher energy region, as shown\n\nin the insets.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.2: Energy levels of armchair rhombus quantum rings, schematically shown in\nFig. 1(e), as a function of the magnetic flux through a single carbon hexagon for two\n\nring widths: (a) NE = 17, NI = 12 and (b) NE = 17, NI = 11. As shown in the insets,\nthe energy spectrum does not have a zero-energy state: states close to E = 0 are rather\n\nsimilar to the first states above and below this energy, which are composed by branches\nof two oscillating energy states.\n\nFigure 3.3 shows that hexagonal armchair quantum rings also share the same kind of\n\nspectrum as the anti-aligned armchair rhombus-shaped ring in Fig. 3.2(a), though in the\nhexagonal case, the spectrum does not depend on the edges alignment, but only on the\nring width. The spectra exhibit crossings and anti-crossings, which separate them into\n\nsix-fold energy bands. A similar spectrum was also obtained in Ref. [138], but the focus\nof this previous work was on the inner and outer edge distribution of the eigenfunctions,\n\nso that details of the spectrum, e.g. its dependence on the ring width and the persistent\ncurrent profile of the energy states at non-zero magnetic field, were not investigated.\n\n\n\n3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 98\n\nNotice that changing the number of carbon hexagons in the inner edge NI and keeping\n\nNE fixed, one effectively changes the width of the ring. Considering a larger ring width,\nwith NE = 15 and NI = 3, as shown in Fig. 3.3(b), the energy spectrum is more strongly\naffected by the magnetic field, so that the regular set of crossings and anti-crossings in Fig.\n\n3.3 (a) is no longer observed in this case. Nevertheless, the qualitative features observed\nin Fig. 3.3(a), including the gap around E = 0 for zero magnetic field, are present for\n\nall ring widths. This is surprising, since in armchair nanoribbons, the character of the\nsystem oscillates between metallic and insulating as the width changes. [88] Although\n\nthe armchair ring in Fig. 3.3(a) is made just by connecting six armchair nanoribbons,\nthe qualitative features of such ribbons are not directly transferable to the quantum ring\n\ncase, which suggests that the ring geometry and the ribbons connections are playing a\nmajor role in these systems. [119]\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(I)\n\n(II)\n\nFigure 3.3: Energy levels of armchair hexagonal quantum rings, schematically shown in\n\nFig. 1(a), as a function of the magnetic flux through a single carbon hexagon for two ring\nwidths: (a) NE = 15, NI = 10 and (b) NE = 15, NI = 3. The spectrum is symmetric\n\nwith respect to E = 0.\n\n\n\n3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 99\n\nNotice that the energy spectra obtained by the TBM either in the case of a rhombus-\n\nshaped armchair ring with anti-aligned edges in Fig. 3.2(a), or for hexagonal armchair\nrings, specially the one with smaller width in Fig. 3.3(a), resembles the AB oscillations\nfor ideal quantum rings reported, e. g. in Fig. 3(a) of Ref. [121]. These structures are\n\nthen good candidates to be well described by the simplified Dirac model for quantum\nrings, developed in Sec. II of the present paper and in Ref. [121].\n\nThus, let us investigate the spectra in Figs. 3.2(a) and 3.3(a) with more details. Notice\nthat both spectra exhibit a gap around E = 0 in the absence of a magnetic field, but the\n\nE = 0 states are found for specific values of the magnetic flux, which are almost equally\nspaced in flux. This is reminiscent of the energy spectrum for Schr\u00f6dinger electrons\n\nconfined in quantum rings under perpendicular magnetic fields, [139, 140, 141] where\nthe energy oscillates periodically with the magnetic flux, due to the Aharonov-Bohm\n\neffect. Similar to the AB effect in semiconductor quantum rings, the energy oscillations\nin Fig. 3.3(a) can also be linked to transitions between states with clockwise and counter-\nclockwise persistent currents, as one can observe in the probability density current plots\n\nin Fig. 3.4. The current for the lowest energy state with decreasing (increasing) energy\nas the magnetic field increases, which are marked by green (brown) ellipses labelled as I\n\n(II) in Fig. 3.3(a), are found to be in (counter-)clockwise direction in Fig. 3.4.\nAs a matter of fact, assuming a Dirac fermion constrained to move in a circle that\n\nis thread by the same magnetic flux as the rhombus or the hexagon, i. e. that encloses\nthe same area as these geometries, as illustrated in Figs. 3.5(a) and 3.6(a), respectively,\n\nand performing the analytical calculations for AB oscillations in the continuum model\nproposed in Sec. III, one obtains almost the same spectra as obtained by the TBM\n\nfor the respective structures. This is demonstrated in Figs. 3.5(b) and 3.6(b) for the\nrhombus-shaped and hexagonal rings, respectively, where the dashed lines are obtained\nby the TBM, whereas the solid lines are for a massless Dirac fermion in a circle of radius R.\n\nBy comparing both models, one observes that: i) the energy gap reaches a maximum value\nE = ~vF/R at ?R = n?0 (n integer) and ii) the system is gapless for ?R = (n + 1/2)?0.\n\nBetter agreement between the models is observed for lower energies and magnetic fields,\nwhere the effects of the curvature of the energy bands and the finite width of the TBM\n\nsample are less important.\nThe main advantage of the simplified analytical model for these systems is to predict\n\neffects and results just by analysing the solutions of the model, without effectively solving\nthe TBM equation, which may require high computational costs. Let us then consider the\n\ncase of a ring deposited over a substrate that provides a constant mass-related potential\nM = 0.5E0. Notice that this is still not the case proposed in Fig. 3.1(h), since in the\n\npresent case we have a constant mass term M, instead of the space-dependent potential\nMi(ri) of Eq. (3.2). The simplified model for a M = 0.5E0 in a circle of radius R predicts\nthat such a mass term is responsible for a minimum gap of E0 in the energy spectrum\n\nat ?R = (n + 1/2)?0, as shown by the solid lines in Figs. 3.5(c) and 3.6(c) for the\n\n\n\n3.4.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 101\n\nrhombus-shaped and hexagonal rings, respectively. Such prediction is indeed confirmed\n\nby the results from the TBM (dashed lines) for the respective site-dependent potentials,\nwhich exhibit very good agreement with the continuum model results.\n\nThe simplified continuum model also predicts that, in the absence of magnetic field,\n\nthe energy levels converge to M? as the ring radius is enlarged, and diverge as E ?\nvF ~|l + 1/2|/R for small radii, which can be inferred from Eq. (3.9). However, for non-\nzero magnetic field, the energies are expected to increase almost linearly with the radius,\nsince Eq. (3.9) can be approximated by E =\n\n?\n(?R)2 + M2, with ? = vFeB/2, as R ? ?\n\nin this case. This is illustrated by the solid lines in Fig. 3.7, which represent the energy\nlevels, obtained by the simplified continuum model, as a function of the ring radius, for a\n\ncircular ring with a substrate induced potential M = 0.1 eV, considering different values\nof magnetic flux. The results obtained by the TBM for an armchair hexagonal ring are\n\ncomputed by varying the number of external carbon rings NE, but keeping the ring width\nconstant (NI = NE ?5), we obtain the dimensions LE = (3NE ?2)a and LI = (3NI ?1)a\n\nand the average radius R =\n(\n\n3\n?\n3\n\n2?\n\n(\n|LE+LI|\n\n2\n\n)2)1/2\n, such that we can relate to the radius of\n\nthe simplified model. The TB results are shown by the dashed lines and exhibit almost\nperfect agreement with the analytical results, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In\n\nboth models, the ground state energy would converge to E = 0 for large radius if it were\nnot for the gap opened by a background mass term considered in this case, which keeps\n\nelectron and hole bands from touching each other even for larger radii.\nIt is however important to point out that the comparison between the models in Figs.\n\n3.4-3.7 is performed for narrow widths of the quantum ring. As previously mentioned, Fig.\n\n3.3(b) demonstrates that larger ring width leads to a stronger dependence of the energy\nspectrum on the magnetic field, which harms the similarities between the energy spectra\n\nobtained by the TBM and the Dirac model. Indeed, the armchair nature of the edges\nhelps the electron to stay in the middle of the rings arms, since this kind of edge type does\n\nnot allow for edge states, while the narrow width of the ring leads to the \u201cfrozen\u201d motion\nin the radial direction, which makes systems with such narrow width more suitable to be\n\ndescribed as an ideal ring in the simplified Dirac model proposed here.\nFinally, let us now discuss how the Dirac model compares to the TBM for a finite\n\nwidth circular graphene ring. The difficulty in this case lies in the fact that one must\nconsider the appropriate boundary conditions in order to properly describe the zigzag and\n\narmchair edges in this structure. [90] For the circular ring cut out from a graphene sheet,\nas shown in Fig. 3.1(g), although the circular symmetry provides an easy way to study\nthe problem by a one-dimensional (radial) equation, the boundary conditions are still too\n\ncomplicated for an analytical treatment of this system, since they are an admixture of\nzigzag and armchair edges. The energy spectrum obtained by the TBM for the circular\n\nring schematically illustrated in Fig. 3.1(g) is presented in Fig. 3.8(a) as a function of\nthe magnetic flux ?R = ?R2B threading the average ring radius R = 80 \u00c5 . Due to the\n\ncircular symmetry, the energy bands are two-folded and exhibit AB oscillations as the\n\n\n\n3.4.

The energy spectrum for a similar system was investigated in\nRef. [138], but there, the two-fold bands are absent, which is due to the fact that the\nsystem considered in this previous work was not perfectly symmetric with respect to the\n\ny?axis, as one can verify by a rigorous analysis of Fig. 7(b) in this reference. In Fig.\n3.8(b), we present results for the mass defined circular quantum ring [94, 95, 117] sketched\n\nin Fig. 3.1(h), considering a potential height M0 = 1 eV and a smooth interface S = 10\n\u00c5 , for a ring with the same average radius and width as in Fig. 3.8(a). The spectrum in\n\nthis case exhibits a ? 170 meV gap, that decreases as the magnetic field increases, and a\ndegenerate ground state. The magnetic field lifts the ground state degeneracy and clear\n\nAB oscillations are observed. Surprisingly, none of the spectra found for the two circular\nstructures investigated here within the TBM resembles the one obtained by the simplified\n\nDirac model of a circular ring. Actually, the results from the simplified model in the\npresence of a background mass (see e. g. Figs. 3.5(b) and 3.6(b)) looks qualitatively\ncloser to the one observed in Fig. 3.8(b) for the mass defined ring, but some evident\n\ndisparities are clearly observed, such as the strong dependence of the gap on the magnetic\nfield, and the existence of two sets of oscillating energies, one that increases and the other\n\nthat decreases as the magnetic field increases, which will be explained further on. In the\ncase of the cut out ring (Fig. 3.1(g)), the different edge types play such an important role\n\nthat the only evidence of the circular character of the system on the energy spectrum lies\nin its weak AB oscillations, and no resemblance with the simplified model spectrum for\n\ncircular rings can be realized in the TBM spectrum for such a system.\nOn the other hand, Recher et al. [94] have shown that when the ring confinement is\n\nprovided by a gap opened in its inner and outer regions due to an infinite mass term, an\nanalytical solution within the Dirac model can be obtained. This solution was repeated\nin subsequent papers, [95, 117] where it was shown that the ground state energy oscillates\n\nperiodically with the magnetic flux and is degenerate in the absence of a magnetic field.\nAs the analytical solution was discussed previously in Refs. [94], [95] and [117], we will\n\nnot repeat them here, and will restrict ourselves to the discussion of the obtained results\nwithin this model. Figure 3.9 shows the energy spectrum, obtained within the Dirac\n\nmodel, for the mass defined ring in Fig. 3.1(h), considering the same parameters as in\nFig. 3.8(b). The results in this case agree very well with those in Fig. 3.8(b), which were\n\nobtained within the TBM. Moreover, a better understanding of the TBM results is now\nprovided by this Dirac model - the two sets of energy states that increase and decrease\n\nwith the magnetic field, which are clearly observed in the TBM results in Fig. 3.8(b), are\nnow demonstrated to come from the contributions of K (red solid) and K? (blue dashed)\n\nbranches of the spectrum, and such a lifting of valley degeneracy may be important for\nfuture valley-tronic devices. Hence, the development of a Dirac model that agrees well\nwith the TBM results in this case now proves its great importance, as there would be\n\nno way to recognize such valley dependence of the energy branches only within the TBM\n\n\n\n3.4.

The spectrum is symmetric with respect to E = 0.\n\n3.4.2 Geometry, edge types, and n-fold energy bands\n\nLet us now discuss the energy spectra of graphene rings having different geometries\n\nand edge types, which were found to be non-compatible with the results from the Dirac\nmodels proposed here, but which display interesting similarities among each other and\n\nwith previous results, besides exhibiting signatures from the symmetry of the ring, as we\nwill demonstrate further on.\n\nFigure 3.10 shows the energy spectra of zigzag hexagonal rings with NE = 15 and\nNI = 10 (a) and NI = 9 (b). Depending on the ring width, the spectrum can either\nexhibit a central six-fold sub-band around E = 0, as in Fig. 3.10(a), or two six-fold\n\nsub-bands separated by a gap around this energy, as shown in Fig. 3.10(b). A structural\ndifference determines the qualitative behavior of the spectrum: the (former) latter is\n\nobtained when the external and internal zigzag edges of the ring are (anti-) aligned, as\nillustrated in the insets. Contrary to the nanoribbon case, for quantum rings it is the\n\nzigzag structure that exhibits an oscillatory behavior as the width changes. This agrees\nwith the fact that the electronic properties of zigzag nanoribbons oriented at 120? with\n\nrespect to one another, exhibit oscillatory behavior as the width changes, whereas such\n\n\n\n3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 108\n\njunctions made with armchair nanoribbons show no qualitative dependence on the width.\n\n[143] This supports the idea that the energy spectra of hexagonal graphene rings are\nstrongly dependent on the electronic properties of their corner junctions.\n\nSuch a strong dependence on the edge type, where even the alignment of the edges play\n\nan important role, is hard to be described by analytical solutions within the continuum\nmodel. Besides, it is clear that both spectra in Fig. 3.10 cannot be obtained from our\n\nsimplified model. Nevertheless, we can still estimate the period of the energy oscillations\nobserved in Fig. 3.10 by ?R = n?0, using a reasonable value of ring radius, which in the\n\ncase of Fig. 3.10 is ? 29 \u00c5 . As the energy spectrum for the aligned case, shown in Fig.\n3.10(b), exhibits a gap around E = 0, one could expect that introducing M 6= 0 in Eq.\n(3.9) would lead to the correct energy spectrum. Although the low-lying states of this\nspectrum resembles qualitatively those in Fig. 3.6(b) for M = 0.5E0, the AB oscillations\n\nfound by the simplified model exhibit a ?-phase shift in comparison to the results in Fig.\n3.10(b), so that the ground state for ?R = 0 in Fig. 3.6(b) (Fig. 3.10(b)) is double (non)\ndegenerate.\n\nNotice that the energy spectrum of hexagonal graphene rings with zigzag edges has\nbeen previously investigated in Ref. [138], but with a different focus. In these previous\n\nresults, the six-fold energy bands of this system were already pointed out. However,\ninformation about the details of the energy spectrum close to the Fermi energy and their\n\ndependence on the edges alignment, as well as the possibility of predicting the period of\nAB oscillations by using the Dirac model, were missing, and are now complemented by\n\nthe results of the present manuscript.\nThe energy spectra of rhombus-shaped quantum rings with zigzag edges are shown\n\nin Fig. 3.11 as a function of the magnetic flux, for the same value of NE as in Fig. 3.2\nand with NI (a) 11 and (b) 9. In this case, due to the geometry of the system, it is not\npossible to construct zigzag rhombus rings having different kinds of edges alignment. In\n\nthis way, the spectra for different ring widths exhibit the same qualitative behavior, with\ntwo-fold energy sub-bands, just like those previously observed for the armchair case in\n\nFig. 3.2. Notice that the states around E = 0, that look like zero-energy states, are rather\ncomposed by three pairs of oscillating states, with very low energy. As a matter of fact,\n\nthe two-fold energy bands of this system have been already pointed out by Bahamon et al.,\n[138] therefore, our results complement the findings of this previous paper by providing\n\ndetails of the energy spectrum around E = 0, as well as the dependence of the energy\nspectrum on the ring width.\n\nFigure 3.12 shows the energy spectra for triangular zigzag quantum rings considering\ntwo ring sizes: (a) NE = 17, NI = 12 and (b) NE = 15, NI = 10. Just like the zigzag\n\nrhombus case, the zigzag triangular rings can only be constructed with aligned edges.\nThe spectra look qualitatively similar to those observed for the zigzag rhombus-shaped\nring in Fig. 3.11, but with three-fold oscillating energy bands for higher energy states,\n\ninstead of the pairs of oscillating states observed in the rhombus-shaped zigzag case.\n\n\n\n3.4.

In the (former) latter the inner\nand outer zigzag edges are (anti-) aligned, as sketched in the insets.\n\nHowever, there are two important differences between these two spectra: (i) the zigzag\ntriangular rings, in fact, exhibit zero-energy (edge) states, no matter the length of its\n\nsides, whereas zigzag rhombus-shaped rings do not, as shown by the insets of Fig. 3.11\nand previously explained in the text; (ii) the first energy state in the zigzag rhombus-\n\nshaped ring is always non-degenerate, whereas this state in the zigzag triangular ring is\ndoubly degenerate. Results in previous papers [138] demonstrate that the anti-crossings\n\nseparating the three-fold energy bands of triangular zigzag quantum rings originate from\nthe coupling between inner and outer edge states.\n\nThe magnetic field dependence of the energy levels of armchair triangular quantum\nrings is shown in Fig. 3.13 for (a) anti-aligned and (b) aligned edges, where the spectra\nare also composed by three-fold oscillating energies, as in the zigzag case. However, the\n\nenergy levels are shown to be much more affected by the magnetic field threading the ring\n\n\n\n3.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 110\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.11: Energy levels of zigzag rhombus quantum rings, schematically shown in Fig.\n\n1(f), as a function of the magnetic flux through a single carbon hexagon for two ring\nwidths: (a) NE = 17, NI = 11 and (b) NE = 17, NI = 9. For both widths, the energy\n\nspectrum does not have a zero-energy state, they are three pairs of oscillating states as\nshown in the insets.\n\nin the armchair case and no significant difference on the edges alignment was observed.\nAnother difference as compared to the zigzag triangular rings is the absence of the zero-\n\nenergy state, which is expected, since the zero energy states are normally related to edge\nstates in zigzag boundaries. [144, 145] The spectra also exhibit a huge gap of ?E > 1 eV\n\naround E = 0, which becomes smaller either as the magnetic field increases or as the ring\nwidth becomes larger (i. e. as NI becomes smaller for a fixed NE).\n\nIt is important to emphasize a clear similarity between the results obtained in the\nprevious sub-section for armchair hexagonal (rhombus-shaped) rings in Fig. 3.3 (Fig.\n\n3.2) and those obtained for the zigzag case in Fig. 3.10 (Fig. 3.11): for any edge type\nor alignment, the energy spectra exhibit six(two)-fold energy bands, with AB oscillations\n\nwith varying magnetic field. A similar effect is also shared by zigzag and armchair tri-\n\n\n\n3.5. CONCLUSION 111\n\nangular rings, as shown in Figs. 3.12 and 3.13, respectively, where the energy spectra\n\nexhibit three-fold bands. These results strongly suggest that the number of energy states\ncomposing these bands is related to the symmetry groups of rotation C6, C2 and C3, for\nhexagon, rhombus and triangle, respectively, which are closely related to the number of\n\nsides of the polygon formed by the ring.[138]\n\n3.5 Conclusion\n\nWe calculated the energy levels of graphene quantum rings with several geometries\n\nunder an applied magnetic field and observed that the energy spectrum and the AB oscil-\nlations for these systems are strongly dependent on their geometry and edge structures.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.12: Energy levels of zigzag triangular quantum rings, schematically shown in\n\nFig. 1(d), as a function of the magnetic flux through a single carbon hexagon for two ring\nwidths: (a) NE = 17, NI = 12 and (b) NE = 15, NI = 10.

CONCLUSION 112\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.13: Energy levels of armchair triangular quantum rings, schematically shown in\n\nFig. 1(c), as a function of the magnetic flux through a single carbon hexagon for two ring\nwidths: (a) NE = 15, NI = 10 and (b) NE = 15, NI = 9. The spectrum is symmetric\nwith respect to E = 0.\n\nFor rings with zigzag edges, the TB spectra for each geometry are qualitatively different,\nshowing six-, three- and two-fold energy sub-bands, separated by large gaps, for hexago-\nnal, triangular and rhombus-like rings, respectively. In the hexagonal case, the alignment\n\nbetween inner and outer zigzag edges is demonstrated to play an important role in the for-\nmation of the sub-bands, whereas the triangular and rhombus rings have only the aligned\n\nedge case due to geometric reasons, presenting similar energy spectra for different sizes.\nSuch a strong dependence of the energy spectrum on the edge structure, specially the ob-\n\nserved oscillatory behavior of the spectra with changing ring width, due to the alignment\nor anti-alignment of the inner and outer edges, is a feature of the quantum ring spectra\n\nthat can hardly be captured by the continuum models.\nThe energy spectrum obtained from the TB model for hexagonal quantum rings with\n\n\n\n3.5. CONCLUSION 113\n\narmchair edges exhibits six-fold sub-bands separated by narrow gaps, which become larger\n\nas the width of the ring increases. The spectrum does not have E = 0 states at zero\nmagnetic field, but exhibits such states for certain values of magnetic flux. Similar features\nare observed for a rhombus-like ring with armchair edges (except for the six-fold sub-\n\nbands which, in this case, are two-fold), but only in the case where the inner and outer\nedges are anti-aligned. The main features of these energy spectra can be obtained by a\n\nsimplified model, which considers electrons obeying the Dirac equation for a circular ring\nwith zero width. Despite the different geometry of the actual rings, with such a simple\n\ncircular model one can (i) estimate the energy levels and the period of AB oscillations or,\nalternatively, estimate the ring radius by analyzing its energy spectrum as a function of\n\nthe magnetic field, even in the presence of a substrate induced staggered potential, which\nappears in the continuum model as a background mass term; (ii) predict the alternating\n\ndirection of the persistent currents through the ring arms as the magnetic field increases,\nobserved in the TBM; and (iii) predict the almost linearly increasing energy states as\na function of the ring radius in the presence of an uniform magnetic field, which is also\n\nconfirmed by the TBM results. The approximation is better suited for rings with smaller\nwidths and for lower energies and magnetic fields. On the other hand, all the results for\n\nthe triangular geometry in the armchair case exhibit three-fold sub-bands separated by\nlarge energy gaps, which cannot be described by such a simplified model.\n\nWe also studied two cases of circular rings within the TB model: in the first one,\nwhere the ring is cut from a graphene layer, we observe an energy spectrum composed\n\nby pairs of energy states which exhibit AB oscillations as the magnetic field increases.\nIn the second, where the electrons are confined in a ring-like structure by an external\n\nstaggered site-dependent potential, the energy spectrum exhibits a gap around E = 0\nand the ground state is doubly degenerate in the absence of a magnetic field. As the\nmagnetic field increases, this degeneracy is lifted, the energy gap is reduced, and AB\n\noscillations are observed in two different branches of energies, one that increases and\nthe other that decreases with magnetic field. Surprisingly, the TBM results for both\n\ncircular cases are very different from those obtained by the simplified continuum model\nfor a circular ring, which, in turn, was demonstrated to perfectly describe hexagonal\n\nand rhombus-like armchair rings. On the other hand, our results demonstrate that the\nspectrum of the staggered potential case can be obtained by the continuum model for a\n\nfinite width circular ring defined by mass barriers, where one identifies the different energy\nbranches observed in the TBM results as coming from different Dirac cones, demonstrating\n\na magnetic field induced lifting of the valley degeneracy in these systems. However, the\nmass boundary conditions used here and in Refs. [94], [95] and [117] are shown to describe\n\nonly the case of a ring defined by a ring-like staggered potential, so that the complicated\nenergy spectrum of the more realistic circular ring cut out of a graphene sheet cannot\nbe described by any of the simplistic boundary conditions or simplified models analyzed\n\nhere.\n\n\n\n3.5. CONCLUSION 114\n\nWe thus summarize our findings with the following general conclusions: 1) rings with\n\na given n-fold symmetry exhibit n-fold energy subbands; 2) edge alignment in zigzag\nhexagonal rings lead to differences in the six-fold sub-bands distribution around the Fermi\nlevel, whereas for armchair rhombus-shaped rings, drastic modifications to the energy\n\nspectrum are observed, specially regarding the separation between the two-fold bands; 3)\nan infinitely thin Dirac ring describes quite well armchair hexagonal and rhombus-shaped\n\n(with anti-aligned edges) structures, specially for thin ring widths; and 4) the Dirac model\nfor a ring defined by infinite mass boundaries does not describe rings cut out of a graphene\n\nflake, but rather those defined by a ring-shaped staggered potential.\n\n\n\n4\nAnalytical study of the energy levels in bilayer\n\ngraphene quantum dots\n\nUsing the four-band continuum model we derive a general expression for the infinite-\nmass boundary condition in bilayer graphene. Applying this new boundary condition\n\nwe analytically calculate the confined states and the corresponding wave functions in a\nbilayer graphene quantum dot in the absence and presence of a perpendicular magnetic\n\nfield. Our results for the energy spectrum show an energy gap between the electron\nand hole states at small magnetic fields. Furthermore the electron (e) and hole (h) energy\n\nlevels corresponding to the K and K? valleys exhibit the Ee(h)K (m) = ?E\nh(e)\nK? (m) symmetry,\n\nwhere m is the angular momentum quantum number.\n\n4.1 Motivation\n\nA considerable number of studies have addressed the electronic properties of quantum\n\ndots (QDs) in semiconductors [146, 147]. Such QDs can be used as single photon sources,\nlasers and are promising candidates for spin qubits and thus for future quantum infor-\n\nmation technology. However the spin-orbit and electron spin-nuclear spin interactions in\nconventional semiconductor QDs, i.e. mainly based on GaAs, limit the spin coherence\n\ntime and thus the functionality of the device.\nVery soon after the discovery of graphene [1, 18], theoretical and experimental studies\n\nappeared on graphene quantum dots (GQDs). GQDs can be exceptional systems for\nspintronics applications due to their long spin coherence time which is a consequence of\n\nthe very weak spin-orbit interaction in graphene. The gapless and linear spectrum of\ngraphene at its Fermi energy in the vicinity of two non-equivalent points in the Brillouin\nzone, namely K and K?, results in the Klein tunneling effect which prevents electrical\n\nconfinement of carriers in graphene structures [124]. Therefore, the direct etching of\na graphene sheet into small flakes seems to be the only realizable way for fabricating\n\nmonolayer graphene QDs. In a series of theoretical studies the energy levels of triangular,\nhexagonal, rectangular and circular QDs have been investigated using both tight-binding\n\n\n\n4.1. MOTIVATION 116\n\nand continuum (i.e. solving the Dirac-Weyl equation) models in the absence and presence\n\nof a perpendicular magnetic field [77, 111, 121, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152]. These studies\ndemonstrate that the energy spectrum of graphene QDs are highly dependent on the\nshapes and edges (which implies different boundary conditions) of the dot.\n\nIt has been recognized that two weakly van der Waals coupled sheets of graphene, i.e.\nknown as bilayer graphene (BLG), has very different electronic properties from graphene\n\n[79]. Pristine BLG is gapless and exhibits an almost parabolic energy spectrum around\nthe K and K? points in its Brillouin zone. The possibility of opening an energy gap in\n\nBLG using a perpendicular electric field, leads to the prediction [125, 153, 154, 155, 156]\nand realization [157, 158] of gate defined QDs in BLG. In such QDs, the edges are no\n\nlonger important.\n\nD = 8\n\nR\n\nD = 0\n\nFigure 4.1: An illustration of a circular quantum dot of radius R made of bilayer graphene.\nThe dot is surrounded by an infinity mass potential ? ? ?.\n\nAlternatively, bilayer graphene flakes are another type of QDs which may exhibit very\n\ndifferent properties but which have been barely studied. Ref. [159] investigated triangular\nBLG dots and Ref. [160] showed the energy levels of circular QDs in BLG surrounded\n\nwith finite flakes within a tight-binding approach.\nUsing the Dirac-Weyl equation a system very similar to circular GQDs was investigated\n\nhalf a century ago, i.e. many years before the excitement about graphene, by Berry and\nMondragon [93] as a theoretical example for the confinement of neutrino\u2019s. The main\nadvantage of this model is that: (i) analytic results can be obtained, and (ii) that the\n\nresults are comparable [111, 121] to the tight-binding results for not too large energies\nand for particular edge termination. It is very surprising that up to now no equivalent\n\ntheoretical study has been made for QDs in BLG. The reason for this can be traced back\nto the non availability of appropriate boundary conditions.\n\nIn this paper, by solving the Dirac-Weyl equation, we obtain for the first time analyti-\ncal results for the energy levels of circular QDs in BLG in the presence of a perpendicular\n\nmagnetic field. A schematic picture of our system is shown in Fig. 4.1. First we derive\nnovel infinite-mass boundary conditions for BLG. Recent experiments in both monolayer\n\n[78, 161, 162] and bilayer [163, 164] graphene report the appearance of an energy gap\nin the energy spectrum due to the interaction with the substrate that is composed by\n\n\n\n4.2. INFINITE-MASS BOUNDARY CONDITION 117\n\na hexagonal atomic lattice, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and SiC. This en-\n\nergy gap is a consequence of an effective mass potential induced by the substrate. The\nvirtues of the infinite-mass boundary conditions has been already discussed for monolayer\ngraphene QDs [77, 90, 126]. The results in Ref. [77] for the energy spectrum of graphene\n\nQDs with infinite-mass boundary conditions have demonstrated reasonable agreement be-\ntween theory and experiment. To complement our study, we compare analytical results\n\nwith the energy levels of a BLG quantum dot surrounded by a mass potential media using\nthe tight-binding approach.\n\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 4.2, we derive the infinite-mass boundary\nconditions for BLG which can be applicable for any dot geometry in BLG. In Sec. 4.3,\n\nwe solve the Dirac-Weyl equation analytically (for both K and K? valleys) and obtain\nthe energy levels of circular QDs in BLG for zero magnetic field and in Sec. 4.4 in the\n\npresence of a perpendicular magnetic field. The cyclotron resonance for the system is\ndiscussed in Sec. 4.5. We summarize our results in Sec. 4.6.\n\n4.2 Infinite-mass boundary condition\n\nHere we will generalise the infinite-mass boundary condition for monolayer graphene\n\nto BLG. Our approach will be based on the formalism discussed in Ref. [165] in which\nthe authors obtain the boundary conditions for the scattering problem of a circular mass\nbarrier in monolayer graphene and extend their work to the case of BLG.

We obtain the following system of\ndifferential equations for region II, i.e. inside the barrier,\n\n?\n\n??\n?B = ?????A ? t??B?,\n\n?\n\n??\n?A = ?????B,\n\n?\n\n??\n?A? = ?????B? ? t??A,\n\n?\n\n??\n?B? = ?????A?, (4.6)\n\nwhich has the solution\n\n?A = Fe\n?+(??1) + Ge??+(??1)\n\n+ He??(??1) + Ie???(??1),\n\n?B = ?\n?\n\n??\n[\n?+Fe\n\n?+(??1) ? ?+Ge??+(??1)\n\n+ ??He\n??(??1) ? ??Ie???(??1)\n\n]\n,\n\n?B? = ?\n[\nFe?+(??1) + Ge??+(??1)\n\n?

(4.9)\n\nConsidering a very thin and very high mass barrier we take the following limits\n\n? ? 0, ?? ? t?, tanh (?\u00b1?) = P = const\n\nwhich allows us to rewrite the set of Eqs.

These general conditions\nallow us to write the boundary condition for a dot-shaped mass barrier, as depicted in\n\nFig. 4.2(b). For this case we take the following limits\n\n?? = ?, P = 1,\n?IIIA (1) = ?\n\nIII\nB (1) = ?\n\nIII\nA? (1) = ?\n\nIII\nB? (1) = 0, (4.11)\n\n\n\n4.3.

(4.12b)\n\nThese are the boundary conditions for a BLG quantum dot surrounded by an infinite-\nmass potential barrier. Notice that Eqs. (4.12a) and (4.12b) connect the value of the\npseudospin components at the boundary of the two sublattices of each layer with each\n\nother. Both equations have the same structure, except for a single sign change. However,\nwe can not simply add the two equations in order to reduce the boundary condition to a\n\nsingle equation. The reason is that the general solution of a four band problem is always\ncomposed of two coefficients to each of the four pseudospin components. The infinite-mass\n\nboundary condition for a monolayer GQD can easily be obtained by removing the second\nlayer, i.e. by putting ?IA?(1) = ?\n\nI\nB?(1) = 0. In the next section we obtain the energy levels\n\nof a circular QD in BLG using the boundary conditions (4.12). In order to find the energy\nspectrum of a BLG quantum dot we need to apply both conditions at the boundaries,\n\nwhich will result in a transcendental equation for the energy levels.\n\n4.3 Energy levels: Zero magnetic field\n\nNow, we consider our main problem and obtain the energy levels of a circular QD\nin BLG in the absence (in current section) and presence (in Sec. 4) of a perpendicular\n\nmagnetic field. We will employ the infinite-mass boundary conditions (i.e. Eqs. (4.12a)\nand (4.12b)).\n\nIn the absence of a magnetic field the Hamiltonian of a BLG and the corresponding\nwave function are respectively given by Eq. (4.1) and Eq. (4.4). Solving H? = E? leads\n\nto the set of coupled equations given by Eq. (4.5). We solved these equation for ?? = 0\n(The infinity mass potential will be applied at the boundary). Decoupling the system of\n\ndifferential equations (4.5) we arrive at the ordinary Bessel differential equation\n\n?2\n?2?A(?)\n\n??2\n+ ?\n\n??A(?)\n\n??\n+\n[\n?2\u00b1?\n\n2 ? m2\n]\n?A(?) = 0, (4.13)\n\nwhere ?\u00b1 =\n?\n?2 \u00b1 t?|?|. We define the solution inside the dot as [166]\n\n?A = C1Jm(?+?) + C2Jm(???),\n\n?B = ?\n1\n\n?\n[C1?+Jm?1(?+?) + C2??Jm?1(???)] ,\n\n?B? = sgn(?) [?C1Jm(?+?) + C2Jm(???)] ,\n\n?A? =\n1\n\n|?|\n[C1?+Jm+1(?+?) ? C2??Jm+1(???)] ,\n\n(4.14)\n\n\n\n4.3. ENERGY LEVELS: ZERO MAGNETIC FIELD 122\n\nwhere Jm(?\u00b1?) is the Bessel function of the first kind and sgn is the sign function. It is\n\nimportant to point out that in the range of |?| ? t?, ?? is pure complex, such that the\nBessel function returns a complex (real) value when m is odd (even), for small values of the\nBessel function argument (k??). Based on this we take into account the real (imaginary)\n\npart of Jm(???) and ??Jm\u00b11(???) when ?? is complex and m is even (odd).\nApplying the boundary conditions (4.12a) and (4.12b) we arrive at a system of two\n\nalgebraic equations. Finding the roots of the determinant of the coefficients, i.e. C1 and\nC2, we obtain a transcendental equation for the energy levels that we solve numerically.\n\n-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n \n\n \n\nE\n (m\n\neV\n)\n\nm\n\n K\n K'\n\nFigure 4.3: Energy levels of a circular BLG quantum dot as a function of angular mo-\n\nmentum label m for R = 70 nm and in the absence of a magnetic field.

The results show that the ground state is\ndegenerate and correspond to m = 0 and m = 1. This can be linked to the geometric\n\nphase which shifts the angular momentum labels in the first and third expressions of Eq.\n(4.5). The electron (e) and hole (h) states in Fig. 4.3 are related by EeK(m) = ?EhK?(m)\nsymmetry, corresponding to a reversal of electrons and hole states when going from valley\nK to K?. Another remarkable symmetry is EeK(m) = E\n\ne\nK(?m) (EhK?(m) = EhK?(?m))\n\nbetween the electron (hole) states of the K (K?) valley while the levels corresponding\nto the K? (K) valley display a shift in energy between negative and positive angular\nmomenta.\n\nResults for the energy levels as a function of the dot radius are shown in Figs. 4.4(a, c,\n\n\n\n4.3.

The energy spectrum shows two sets of levels. The\nupper set of levels approach for large R the inter-layer hopping term in BLG, i.e. t ? 400\nmeV and is related to the upper band of BLG. For B0 = 0, the spectrum shows a 1/R2\n\ndependence for the lowest states and 1/R for the states in the upper set. This can be\nlinked to the fact that in BLG the low energy levels are related to a parabolic dispersion\n\nE ? k2 and the higher energies can be approximated with a linear dispersion E ? k.\n\n4.4 Energy levels: Perpendicular magnetic field\n\nIn the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field B0 the momentum operators ? and\n?\u2020 in Hamiltonian (4.1) are defined as\n\n? = vFe\ni?\n\n[\n?i~\n\n(\n?\n\n?r\n+\ni\n\nr\n\n?\n\n??\n\n)\n+ i\n\neB0r\n\n2\n\n]\n, (4.15a)\n\n?\u2020 = vFe\n?i?\n[\n?i~\n\n(\n?\n\n?r\n? i\nr\n\n?\n\n??\n\n)\n? ieB0r\n\n2\n\n]\n, (4.15b)\n\nwhere we used the symmetric gauge for the vector potential ~A = (0,B0r/2, 0). Acting\nthe Hamiltonian (4.1) on ?, given by Eq.

For\n\nB0 6= 0 as the size of the dot increases the spectrum becomes weakly dependent on the\ndot radius and the energy levels approach the Landau levels (LLs) of BLG. As a result,\n\nthe low-lying states approach E = 0, which corresponds to the zeroth LL of BLG. The\ninterplay between the confinement due to the magnetic field and due to the infinite-mass\n\npotential leads to the appearance of anti-crossings between the levels of one valley and\ncrossings between the levels of two different valleys.\n\nm = 0\n\nm = -1\n\nm = 1\n\nm = -2\n\nm = 1\n\nm = 0m = 2\n\nm = 0, -1, -2, -3, -4\n\nm = 0, -1, -2, -3, -4\n\nFigure 4.5: Energy spectrum of a circular BLG quantum dot as a function of a per-\n\npendicular magnetic field with R = 70 nm and for ?4 ? m ? 4.

The blue dashed and red\nsolid curves respectively show the energy levels for the K and K? valleys. In the inset\nof Fig. 4.5 we present a zoom of the energy levels at low magnetic fields. At B = 0,\n\nthe two lowest degenerate states, i.e. EK(m = 1) and EK?(m = 0), belong to different\nvalleys. Notice that the upper set of degenerate levels are pertinent to the same valleys\n\n(i.e. EK(m = ?1) = EK(m = 1) and EK(m = 0) = EK(m = 2)). This degeneracy\nis lifted for nonzero magnetic field which is a consequence of the discretization of the\n\nenergy spectrum when a magnetic field is applied.

We should emphasize that this symmetry is present in both zero and nonzero\nmagnetic fields. For large magnetic field (i.e. when lB ? R) the carriers become strongly\nlocalized at the center of the dot and the energy levels approach the LLs of a pristine\nBLG sheet, i.e. En = (~vF/lB)\n\n?\n2n + 1 \u00b1 1 with n = 0, 1, 2, .... The energy states that\n\napproach the LLs of BLG satisfy the condition m ? n where n denotes the nth LL of\nBLG. For example those states that approach the zeroth and the first LLs respectively\ncorrespond to the m ? 0 and m ? 1 states. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that\nfound in monolayer QDs with infinite-mass potential [111] and in semiconductor QDs\n[168].\n\nDespite of having the advantage of analytical solutions using the continuum model, it\nis interesting to obtain the energy spectrum within the tight-binding approach in which\n\nwe are able to study a QD in BLG with realistic edges. We employ a first-nearest-neighbor\ntight-binding formalism [111, 149] for circular QDs cut out from BLG and surrounded by\n\na mass potential media where the sublattices A and B in both upper and lower layers are\nrespectively connected to potentials +V and ?V with V = 1 eV. In order to avoid the\ninfluence of outer edges we take a hexagonal structure with armchair edges for the mass\npotential media. The energy levels of a QD with radius R = 10 nm is shown in Figs.\n4.6(a) and 4.6(b) respectively obtained using the continuum and tight-binding models.\n\n\n\n4.5. CYCLOTRON RESONANCE 128\n\nA circularly cut-out region in bilayer graphene has a combination of both zigzag and\n\narmchair edges at the boundaries which mixes the states in the K and K? valleys. This\nmakes the QD more complex system. Therefore, our results presented in Fig. 4.6(b) are\nonly qualitatively comparable with those obtained using the previous continuum model in\n\nFig. 4.6(a). In both cases, the energy levels approach the LLs of bulk BLG as magnetic\nfield increases. The energy levels in both spectra exhibit similar magnetic field depen-\n\ndences. Two interesting features are found within the tight-binding calculations (see Fig.\n4.6(b)): (i) the energy levels approach the zeroth LL of BLG in groups of two. This can\n\nbe linked to the symmetry of the wave functions due to the confinement brought by the\nzigzag edges of the cut out circular QD. In Figs. 4.6(c) and 4.6(d) we show the electron\n\ndensities corresponding to the points indicated by (c) and (d) (chosen from one group of\nenergy levels) in Fig. 4.6(b). (ii) Degeneracies are lifted resulting in many more energy\n\nlevels. This is a consequence of the mixing of the K and K? states due to the presence of\narmchair and zigzag edges at the circular boundary of the QD.\n\nIn Fig. 4.7, we show a contour plot of the probability density, separately for each\n\nlayer, as a function of the normalized magnetic field and the dot radius for the states\ncorresponding to the K valley and for (a, b) m = 0, (c, d) m = 1, and (e, f) m = ?1. Left\nand right panels show respectively the densities |?A|2 + |?B|2 and |?A?|2 + |?B?|2 which\ncorrespond to the charge density in the different layers. As the magnetic field increases\n\nthe electrons become more localized closer to the center of the dot. Our results clearly\nshow different distributions of the electrons in each layer. This can be traced back to the\n\ndefinition of the infinite-mass boundary conditions in Eqs. (4.12a) and (4.12b) in which the\nspinor ?B? has a different sign in the equations. This will influence the density balance in\n\neach layer. Another consequence of the boundary condition used in the continuum model\nis the symmetry between the four wave function components ?K\n\nA(A?)\n(m) = ?K\n\n?\n\nA(A?)\n(m) and\n\n?K\nB(B?)\n\n(m) = ?K\n?\n\nB(B?)\n(m).\n\n4.5 Cyclotron resonance\n\nIn cyclotron resonance experiments, e.g. see Refs. [169, 170, 171, 172, 173], transitions\nare induced between the ground state and excited states. We calculated the transition\n\nbetween the state i and j using the relation |??i|?e\u00b1i?|?j?|2 which dictates the selection\nrule ?m = \u00b11. Another selection rule which is due to the valley index in graphene is\n?? = 0 implying that transitions between inter-valley states is not allowed [174, 175].\nIn Figs. 4.8(a) and 4.8(b) we show the transition energies ?? and the corresponding\n\ntransition rates as function of magnetic field from the two lowest energy states shown in\nthe inset of Fig. 5, i.e. EK?(m = 0), EK(m = 1).

The bound-\nary conditions were obtained from a four-band continuum model. Subsequently, we em-\nployed these boundary conditions for a circular QDs in BLG surrounded by an infinite-\n\nmass potential. Such a mass potential can be realized experimentally using an appropriate\nsubstrate that breaks the sublattice symmetry of BLG resulting in the opening of an en-\n\nergy gap in the band structure of BLG.\nSolving the four-band Dirac-Weyl Hamiltonian, in the vicinity of both K and K?\n\nvalleys, we obtained analytically the energy levels and the corresponding wave functions\nof a BLG quantum dot. The energy spectrum was calculated in the absence and presence\n\nof a perpendicular magnetic field. We demonstrated that the energy spectrum exhibit\ntwo sets of states as function of dot radius R. The upper set of levels is related to the\n\nupper band of BLG and approach the inter-layer hopping term in BLG, i.e. t ? 400 meV.\n\n\n\n4.6.

The results\n\ncorresponding to the K and K? valleys are respectively shown by the solid and dashed\ncurves.\n\nAt zero magnetic field the spectrum shows a 1/R2 dependence for the lowest states and\n1/R for the states in the upper set.\n\nOur results show that the energy levels approach the LLs of a BLG sheet with in-\ncreasing magnetic field. The spectrum shows the symmetry Ee(h)K (m) = ?E\n\nh(e)\nK? (m) corre-\n\nsponding to a reversal of electron and hole states. This symmetry is present in the absence\nand presence of a magnetic field and it is a consequence of the confinement due to the\n\ninfinity mass potential. Within the tight-binding approach, we obtained the energy levels\nof a BLG quantum dot with actual edges and showed that the results are qualitatively\n\nsimilar to those obtained with the continuum model. Further, we obtained the transition\nenergies and evaluated the corresponding transition rates for the lowest energy levels in\n\na BLG quantum dot.\nThe QDs we studied in this paper may be realized experimentally by using appropriate\n\nsubstrates containing a circular hole, e.g. hexagonal boron nitride [176], in order to induce\nan infinity mass potential on BLG.\n\n\n\n5\nMonolayer-bilayer graphene quantum dots\n\nUsing the tight-binding model, we study the confined states in two different hybrid\nmonolayer - bilayer systems: (i) a hexagonal anti-dot in bilayer graphene under perpen-\ndicularly applied electric field and (ii) a hexagonal bilayer graphene dot surrounded by a\nhexagonal region of monolayer graphene. The behavior of the energy levels as a function\nof dot size and under an applied external magnetic field is investigated. In the presence\nof electrostatic bias we find that the energy spectrum for dots formed by zigzag edges\npresents states inside the gap whose features are marked by dot-localized states, edge\nstates and mixed states coexisting together, whereas for dots with armchair edges one has\nonly dot-localized states. We demonstrate that these dot-localized energy levels inside the\ngap formed by the potential bias decrease as the dot size increases as already expected\nfor a quantum dot confined state, while edge and mixed states exhibit an opposite be-\nhavior. In the presence of both magnetic and electric fields for a zigzag dot we observe\ntopologically protected states inside the gap and the convergence of the energy spectra to\nthe Landau levels in all system configurations.\n\n5.1 Motivation\n\nQuantum dots (QDs) in graphene, a monolayer of graphite [1, 18], and in bilayer\ngraphene are the subject of a considerable number of both theoretical and experimen-\ntal studies [148, 177, 178] with the hope of benefiting of the exceptional properties of\ngraphene, such as high carrier mobility and long spin coherence time for electronic and\nparticularly spintronic applications. The absence of an energy gap in both monolayer\n(MLG) and bilayer graphene (BLG) spectrum is the main obstacle preventing straight-\nforward fabrication of graphene QDs. However, BLG is in particular of interest, in which\na perpendicular electric field realized by external gate potentials applied to the different\nlayers of BLG can open an energy gap [79]. Recent theoretical [125, 153, 154, 155] and\nexperimental [157, 158] studies demonstrate electron confinement into gate-defined QDs\nby tailoring the gap in BLG.\n\n\n\n5.1. MOTIVATION 132\n\nQDs in MLG are fabricated by direct etching of a pristine graphene sheet into the small\nflakes in which the shape and edges of the dot become very important. The electronic and\ntransport properties of such QDs with different shapes and different edges are investigated\nextensively [77, 96, 111, 121, 149, 150, 151, 152]. There also exist several theoretical\nstudies pertinent to BLG flakes in which, in contrast to the gate-defined QDs in BLG,\nedge disorder influences the electronic properties of the dot significantly [159, 160].\n\nRealistic few layer graphene samples extracted from graphite often contain patches of\nboth MLG and BLG. Electronic transport measurements demonstrated the importance\nof monolayer-bilayer interface states in transport and electronic properties of quantum\nstructures fabricated based on such samples [179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184]. The monolayer-\nbilayer interface states were theoretically investigated in a system of two semi-infinite\nMLG and BLG sheets with both zigzag- and armchair-terminated junctions in the absence\n[185, 186] and presence [187, 188] of an external magnetic field.\n\nFigure 5.1: (Color online) Sketches of the studied systems in this work composed by\nhexagonal shaped quantum dots of size L in bilayer graphene created by (a) cutting out\natoms in the inner region of the top layer and (b) with the top layer being smaller than\nthe bottom one. In both cases (a) and (b), the outer edges are taken armchair forming\na hexagonal dot with a larger size. A cross-section view of the dots are presented at the\nbottom of each system. The distance between the layers is d, that was taken as ? 100 \u00c5.\n\nThe existence of both monolayer and bilayer islands in exfoliated graphene samples,\nmotivated us to propose different types of graphene QDs consisting of both MLG and\nBLG. In this paper, we study the confined states into two different systems schematically\ndepicted in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b): (i) a hexagonal MLG dot surrounded by a hexagonal\nbiased BLG region, and (ii) a hexagonal BLG dot surrounded by a hexagonal region of\nMLG. The outer boundaries of the considered systems are terminated by armchair edges\nin order to avoid the influence of edge states corresponding to the outer hexagonal dot.\nThe found QD states are therefore not influenced by the finite size of the total system\nand are therefore representative for an infinite system. Using nearest-neighbour tight-\nbinding formalism we obtain the energy levels of these QDs for both zigzag and armchair\n\n\n\n5.2. NUMERICAL METHOD 133\n\nterminated monolayer-bilayer interface. We report our results in the absence and presence\nof a perpendicular magnetic field.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly discuss the tight-binding\napproach used in our numerical calculations. In Sections III(A) and III(B) we present\nthe energy levels of the QDs illustrated in Figs. 5.1(a) and (b), respectively, for zero and\nexternal magnetic field. Finally we present concluding remarks in Sec. IV.\n\n5.2 Numerical Method\n\nIn order to describe electrons in an AB-stacked bilayer graphene, we work within the\ntight-binding approximation, whose nearest-neighbor tight-binding Hamiltonian can be\nwritten as\n\nHTB =\n\n2?\n\nn=1\n\n?\n\ni\n\n(?n;i + Vn;i)c\n\u2020\nn;icn;i (5.1)\n\n+\n\n2?\n\nn=1\n\n?\n\n<i,j>\n\n(\n?ijc\n\n\u2020\nn;icn;j + ?\n\n?\nijcn;ic\n\n\u2020\nn;j\n\n)\n\n+ ??\n?\n\ni,j\n\n(\nc\n\u2020\n1;ic2;j + c1;ic\n\n\u2020\n2;j\n\n)\n,\n\nwhere cn;i(c\n\u2020\nn;i) annihilates (creates) an electron in site i, with on-site energy ?i. n is the\n\nlayer index, the sum\n?\n\n<i,j> is taken only between nearest neighbor sites i and j in each\nlayer and ?ij (??) is the (intra-) inter-layer hopping energy. Let us label the bottom layer\nas layer 1 and the upper layer as layer 2. Thus, the first term of HTB corresponds to the\non-site energy and external potential, the second term is related to the Hamiltonian for\neach layer and the third term describes the interlayer coupling in which we consider only\nthe hopping between the two atoms stacked right on top of each other. The potential\nin each site i and in each layer n is represented by Vn;i and was included only for the\nsystem configuration shown in Fig. 5.1(a) where we considered the symmetric situation\nV1;i = ?V0 and V2;i = V0 for the bottom and top layers, respectively. The way that we\napply the bias potential is similar as has been done in Ref. [160], where it was assumed\nopposite potentials applied to the two layers, thereby allowing the conservation of electron-\nhole symmetry. Note that different works the external gate potential was taken just in one\nof the layers while keeping the other at a constant value [154]. By applying an external\nelectrical potential, a gap in the energy spectrum is opened. Due to this feature, different\nkinds of confining structures in bilayer graphene can be achieved [160]. In this perspective\nquantum dots [154, 155] and rings [121, 156, 166] in bilayer graphene have been already\nstudied analytically by applying appropriate gate potentials. Nowadays, nanostructure\nfabrication allows for an accurate spatial control of the electrostatic modern potential and\nthis independent on the top and bottom layer[189, 190] of suspended BLG [157] and in\naddition in a split and localized way for the bottom[191] and top[192] gates.\n\n\n\n5.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 134\n\nThe actual outer hexagonal structure used in this work has dimension of ? 325, 18\n\u00c5 which corresponds to a length of ? 77 carbon hexagons in each side. The tight-\nbinding approach applied here has been already discussed [79, 80, 193] and used [159, 160]\npreviously, as well as in the theoretical treatment of the interface between MLG and BLG\n[185, 188].\n\n5.3 Results and discussion\n\n5.3.1 Zero magnetic field\n\nLet us now investigate the energy spectrum for the system configurations Figs. 5.1(a)\nand 5.1(b) in the absence of a magnetic field and in the presence of a bias voltage for the\nformer case. In both cases we verify the dependence on the type of edge of the inner dot:\n(i) the inner edge of the top hexagonal anti-dot (for Fig. 5.1(a)) and (ii) the hexagonal\nbilayer dot in the top layer (for Fig. 5.1(b)). Figure 5.2 shows the energy spectrum as\na function of the anti-dot size L for hexagonal BLG quantum dots with zigzag edges as\nsketched in Fig. 5.1(a). In the bottom (top) layer a potential ?V0 (+V0) with V0 = 0.1\neV was applied such that it opens a gap of 2V0 in the spectrum, as can be seen in Fig.\n5.2. Since the dot has zigzag edges, we obtain many energy levels inside the gap. This\ncharacteristic is a signature of the zero energy states observed in MLG quantum dots with\nzigzag edges [149, 194].\n\nAnother important remark about Fig. 5.2 is related to the anti-crossings that appear\nin the spectrum, as shown in the enlarged region (yellow circle) around L ? 110 \u00c5.\nThe anti-crossing behavior can be better understood when we look at the corresponding\nelectron probability densities for the points (1 to 15) indicated in the zoom. These results\nfor |?|2 = |?1|2 +|?2|2, where ?1(2) represents the wave function in the bottom (top) layer,\nare shown in Fig. 5.3 and they indicate that at the anti-crossing (points 6, 7, 9 and 10)\nthe electrons are confined due to the interplay between edges states corresponding to the\nzigzag edges and inside the dot owing to bias voltages, as presented in Fig. 5.3(c). The\nlevels with increasing energy indicated by points 1, 2 and 3 and shown in Fig. 5.3(a),\ncorrespond to states that are confined at the zigzag edges near the MLG and BLG junction.\nIt was realized that, even though the bottom layer does not present explicit edges close to\nthe middle of the system, the electron feels the edges corresponding to interlayer coupling\nnear to the MLG and BLG junction. The same kind of confinement was observed for the\npoints 8, 13, 14 and 15 as shown in Figs. 5.3(d) and 5.3(e), respectively. Each set of\npoints formed by (a) 1, 2 and 3, and (d) 8, 13 and 14 have the same symmetry and all of\nthem are edges states whose only difference is the fact that they are shifted by ?/3 due\nto the C3 symmetry which belongs to the hexagonal geometry. It can be observed that\nthe levels 1, 2 and 3 that are going up are almost degenerated and only one of them (3)\nkeeps increasing and the others two edge states (1 and 2) undergo a transition from a mix\n\n\n\n5.3.

A zoom of the yellow region is shown to\nemphasize the behaviour around the anti-crossing of different states.\n\nof edge states and states inside the dot (6 and 7) to just states localised inside the dot\n(11 and 12). The level corresponding to point 3 remains to be an edge state as indicated\nby points 8 and 13 in the same line, as shown in Fig. 5.3(d). The levels corresponding\nto states 4, 5, 11 and 12 are states purely inside the dot and they are decreasing as the\nanti-dot size increases, as shown in Fig. 5.3(b). Thus, it can be summarized that the\nstates inside the gap, for an anti-dot created at the top layer of bilayer graphene and in\nthe presence of a gate potential, are due to the interplay of zigzag edge states that are\nincreasing in energy with L and states completely inside the anti-dot located only on the\nbottom layer that present decreases in energy with L.\n\nIn the quest to obtain an energy spectrum which has a gap, but on the other hand\nthat is not too polluted by other states as observed in the spectrum for anti-dot formed\nby zigzag edge in bilayer graphene shown in Fig. 5.2, we perform now a study in the case\nthat the cut out bilayer graphene anti-dot is built with armchair edges. The result for\nthe energy levels of armchair anti-dots as a function of the side length L is presented in\nFig. 5.4. Note that if we put the spectrum shown in Fig. 5.4 on the top of the spectrum\ndemonstrated in Fig. 5.2, one verifies that they match to a very good agreement, such\nas all energy levels inside the gap (for energies between E ? [?V0,V0]) decrease in the\nsame way and with the same slope. These decreasing energies correspond to states that\nare confined inside the dot created in the bottom layer. It can be seen in Figs. 5.5(a, b,\nc) for the point 1 (E ? 0.03499 eV and L ? 78.10 \u00c5) in the spectrum of Fig. 5.4 that\n\n\n\n5.3.

It implies that the total probability density is largely localized in\nthe center of the system. Thus, it indicates that most significant difference between the\nenergy spectra for the zigzag (Fig. 5.2) and armchair (Fig. 5.4) edged QDs is the presence\nof states inside the gap that correspond to edge states localised at the inner zigzag edge.\nMoreover, as for the zigzag case (Fig. 5.2) the energy levels above (E > V0) and below\n(E &lt;?V0) the gap region converge to the values V0 and ?V0, respectively. These states\nare spread out over the bilayer graphene, i. e. they are localized on the large hexagonal\n\n\n\n5.3.

Small\n(large) circle with blue (red) color represents low (high) density. The bilayer region is\nshadowed by the gray color.\n\nbilayer dot. However, there is a transition between dot-localized states that are inside the\ngap (|E| &lt;V0) and states that are completely spread along the large hexagonal bilayer\ndot (|E| > V0). These energy levels can be seen immediately below E ? V0 and above\nE ? ?V0. Their dependence on L is almost flat and the counter plot of their density\nprobabilities demonstrate a mix of dot-localized state for the bottom layer and a spread\nstate along the top layer. It is illustrated in Figs. 5.5(d, e, f) for the point 2 indicated in\nthe armchair energy spectrum shown in Fig. 5.4, respectively for (d) bottom layer |?1|2,\n(e) top layer |?2|2 and (f) the total probability |?1|2 + |?2|2.\n\nAs a suggestion of another kind of confinement structure in bilayer graphene, we shall\nstudy the dependence of the energy levels of the system sketched in Fig. 5.1(b) as a\nfunction of the flake size L that is surround by hexagonal monolayer graphene. This\nanalysis is done in the absence of any external potential, as can be identified in the\nschematic cross-section view at the bottom part of the system, i. e. we assumed that\nV1(2) = 0. A general feature noticed in this kind of system is that the energy spectrum\nfor quantum dots formed by both edges, zigzag and armchair shown in Figs. 5.6(a) and\n5.6(b) respectively, does not change for sizes smaller than ? 25 \u00c5 (? 40 \u00c5) for the zigzag\n(armchair) case. This invariance, related to the type of edges, is due to the fact that for\nsmall size of the dot in the bilayer region the electron does not feel and does not recognize\nthe system as a bilayer, but rather as monolayer graphene. Thus, for small sizes L . 25\n\u00c5 (zigzag edge) and L . 40 \u00c5 (armchair edge), the energy spectrum forms plateaus\nconverging to values, that match the same values for both edge configurations, as shown\nby the black dashed lines in Fig. 5.6. These are the monolayer energy levels, since for\nboth edge termination, systems (a) and (b) have the same size. Notice that in general,\n\n\n\n5.3.

The dashed lines are the energy levels of the monolayer system that has the\nsame dimension as the bottom layer for the bilayer system sketched in Fig. 5.1(b).\n\nthe degeneracy of the energy levels is lifted and the plateaus become less pronounced\nas one increases the size L, resulting in many more energy levels. An illustration of an\nexception in the degeneracy breaking is the first state in the spectrum for the armchair dot\nin Fig. 5.6(b), that remains a degenerate state. For both edge terminations, Fig. 5.6(a)\nzigzag and 5.6(b) armchair, the energy levels decrease when L increases, being different\nin two aspects: (i) for the zigzag case, more states are obtained and they decrease with\nL converging to zero-energy and forming plateaus when E matches the monolayer levels;\nand (ii) a large gap in the armchair spectrum stays open even for large dot sizes.\n\nTo confirm our statements about delocalized states for small L and dot-localized states\nfor large L, we show in Fig. 5.7 the modulus squared of the wave functions for the points\n1, 2, 3 and 4 indicated in panels (a) and (b) of spectrum presented in Fig. 5.6. As shown\nin the zoom on the circular panel of Fig. 5.6(a), there are three states that are going\ndown being two of them approximately degenerate (E ? 0.02150 eV and E ? 0.02159\neV), given by the point 1 located at L ? 100.84 \u00c5. It was verified that these two states\ncome from the same initial plateau, hence their wave functions have the same behavior\nand type of symmetry, as shown in Fig. 5.7(a). Both levels are essentially edge states\nand only differ by a rotation of ?. The other energy level, point 2 shown in Fig. 5.7(b)\nwith energy E ? 0.02556 eV, is a combination of edge and center localized state.

The point 3 placed on the plateaus\nenergy range (L ? 22, 72 \u00c5) is an example of a delocalized state that is spread out over\nonly the monolayer graphene. On the other hand, for large dot size, as for example for\nL ? 99.40 \u00c5 given by point 4, one finds dot-localized state with |?|2 located in the middle\nof the bilayer system. Thus, we can verify that the proposed structure sketched in Fig.\n5.1(b) can be used as a confined system for carriers in MLG/BLG junction.\n\n5.3.2 In the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field\n\nIn this section, we include an external magnetic field, with possible addition or not of\na bias voltage for the system sketched in Fig. 5.1(a).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 141\n\nLet us first consider the unbiased case, and investigate the effect of a magnetic field.\nIn Fig. 5.8 we show the results for the energy spectrum of hexagonal bilayer graphene\nquantum dots with (a, b) armchair and (c, d) zigzag edges as a function of the magnetic\nflux (?/?0). In this section, our results for the zigzag and armchair edges are obtained\nfor fixed anti-dot side lengths, respectively L ? 49.19 \u00c5 and L ? 52.54 \u00c5 corresponding\nto N = 20 and N = 13 hexagonal carbon rings in each edge. In general, for both edge\nterminations, as the magnetic flux increases, the energy levels approach the Landau levels\nof an unbiased bilayer graphene[86, 155], represented by the red lines, and more and\nmore excited states converge to the zeroth Landau level, which naturally produces (anti)-\ncrossings between the excited states, as shown in Figs. 5.8(b) and 5.8(d). Furthermore,\nthese figures clearly demonstrate that the energy spectrum possesses an electron-hole\nsymmetry, i. e. Eh = ?Ee, where h(e) denotes hole (electron). Comparing Figs. 5.8(a,\nb) and 5.8(c, d), we can realize that the energy levels are almost similar, except at small\nmagnetic flux values in which: (i) the spectrum for zigzag quantum dots exhibits edge\nstates that are not present in armchair dots for the levels near zero energy and (ii) in\naddition, the spectrum for armchair quantum dots exhibits a gap around E = 0. As\nmagnetic flux increases, the degeneracy of the energy levels is lifted resulting in a closing\nof the energy gap in the spectrum of armchair quantum dots. These two behaviours\ngiven by the presence of many zero energy states for zigzag hexagonal dots and by the\npresence of a gap in the energy spectrum for armchair hexagonal dots for B = 0 are also\nfound in zigzag and armchair quantum dots in monolayer graphene under the influence\nof an external magnetic field, as it has been already studied in Refs. [111], [138] and\n[194]. These results are comparable between monolayer and bilayer quantum dots, since\nthe confinement created by the system sketched in Fig. 5.1(a) is located mainly in one\nlayer, i. e. the bottom one, in this manner the confined states exhibit qualitatively\nsimilar behavior as if the system were only composed of one layer. The interplay between\nconfinement by the magnetic field and quantum dot confinement is responsible for the\nappearance of several crossings and anti-crossings in the energy spectrum for both edge\ntermination cases.\n\nFigure 5.9 depicts the density distribution for the states denoted in the Fig. 5.8(a)\nthat are emphasized in the yellow circular region and shown in the inset by the red\npoints 1 and 2. The points 1 and 2 have respectively energies E ? 0.05638 eV and\nE ? 0.05369 eV and magnetic flux ?/?0 ? 0.00154 and ?/?0 ? 0.00159. As one observes\nin the inset, the pair of states that have nearby energy they switch their behaviour at the\nanti-crossing. This kind of feature can only be captured by the tight-binding approach,\nbecause in the continuum model these increasing states should be formed by a single\nstate. These seemingly degenerate states become even more separated as the magnetic\nflux increases, which is related to the lifting of the degeneracy by the magnetic field.\nThus, to identify the origin of each tendency we plot the contribution of each layer to\nthe electron density in separated way for the points 1 and 2 corresponding to the states\n\n\n\n5.3.

Figures 5.9(a) and 5.9(b) show\nrespectively the bottom and top layer contribution for the wave function corresponding\nto the electron states indicated by the point 1, while Figs. 5.9(d) and 5.9(e) are for the\nwave function of the point 2. The squared total wave function for the points 1 and 2 are\nshown in Figs. 5.9(c) and 5.9(f). Notice that both group of states are edge states, but\nlocated in different regions of the bilayer system. This resembles the inner and outer edge\nstates found in quantum rings made of monolayer graphene [138].\n\nThe dependence of the energy levels of hexagonal BLG quantum dots on the magnetic\nflux for non-zero bias field is shown in Fig. 5.10, respectively for anti-dots with (a, b) arm-\nchair and (c, d) zigzag edges. The applied bias was V0 = 0.1 eV. As can be seen, the energy\nspectrum for both edge terminations approaches the Landau levels, that in this case are\nthe Landau levels for biased bilayer graphene with V0 = 0.1 eV, shown by dashed red lines.\nAs has been already reported[86, 195, 196], the Landau levels for biased bilayer graphene is\ngiven by ? = [??u0]2/2+(?u)2/8\u00b11/2\n\n?\n? ?2[(? ? u0)2 ?

As one can\nnotice, the vast majority of Landau levels increase as the magnetic flux increases, but there\nare two states, for electrons and holes, that intersect each other at E = 0.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 144\n\nanother aspect can be observed in the Landau levels of biased BLG and, consequently, in\nthe energy spectrum calculated here, is the appearance of crossings at very small values\nof ?/?0. As already studied in Ref. [86], the crossings between the Landau levels for a\nbiased bilayer graphene in each branch (positive and negative levels) occur at larger values\nof the magnetic field as the potential difference increases. These two features arise from\nthe potential difference between the layers and can be explained by taking into account\nthe non-parabolicity of the band structure of biased bilayer graphene, which displays a\nmexican hat shape that becomes more pronounced as the potential difference becomes\nlarger.\n\nOne important consequence of the combination of the magnetic field together with\nthe presence of an electrostatic confinement is that it breaks the inversion symmetry of\nthe bilayer, i. e. the spectrum is now electron-hole asymmetric Eh 6= ?Ee. Furthermore,\none can notice from Fig. 5.10 that: (i) for small values of ?/?0 the spectrum for both\nedge termination possesses a large gap around E = 0 that becomes less pronounced as\nthe magnetic flux increases; (ii) two different bands can be recognized, one for the levels\ninside the gap between E ? [?V0,V0] and the other for the highest states that converge\nto the E = \u00b1V0 axes defined by the value of the bias; (iii) similarly as in the unbiased\ncase, i. e. Fig. 5.8, pairs of states with nearby energy values are decreasing together and\nend up converging to the E = \u00b1V0 axis in the present case and to the zeroth Landau\nlevel in the former case, but here for instance they seem to cross each other in the same\nmagnetic field range; (iv) the positive part of the spectrum that forms the band located\ninside the gap has a different characteristic as compared with the negative part of the\nspectrum, in which the negative part presents many crossings that are not present in\npositive one; and (v) states that do not change whit the magnetic field are observed only\nfor zigzag BLG quantum dots, and can be associated with topologically protected (edge)\nstates, since their properties are preserved even when some external parameter varies.\nThese topologically protected states are observed only for the positive part of the zigzag\nquantum dot spectrum inside the gap and, according to the inset shown in Fig. 5.10(c),\nwhich presents a zoom of the yellow rectangle around ?/?0 ? 1.7 \u00d7 10?3, one can realize\nthat these topological states in fact are composed not really by a single state, but rather\nby a band of curves that has a flat behaviour for the same specific magnetic flux values.\n\nLet us now investigate the density distribution for some states inside the gap region, as\ndenoted by points 1?6 and 7?10, respectively for armchair and zigzag edge terminations\nin the presence of both magnetic field and a gate voltage, as shown in Figs. 5.10(b) and\n5.10(d). We first analyze the wave functions for anti-dots formed by inner armchair\nedges, whose plots are shown in Fig. 5.11 for the points 1 ? 6. As already expected,\nand similar to Figs. 5.5(a)-5.5(c) corresponding to the armchair anti-dot case in Sec.\n5.3.1, the decreasing states inside the gap are dot-localized states, as observed for the\nstate shown in Fig. 5.11(a) corresponding to the point 1 in the spectrum given by Fig.\n5.10(b). All the decreasing states inside the gap region and before the crossing between\n\n\n\n5.3.

Small (large) circle\nwith blue (red) color represents low (high) density. The bilayer region is shadowed by the\ngray color.\n\nthe two zeroth biased Landau levels have the same feature as the one for the point 1,\nbut the same behaviour does not occur for the states with higher magnetic flux after the\nLandau levels crossing. As one can notice from Figs. 5.11(b)-5.11(d) these states are\nspread out over the whole bilayer system. The wave functions for the pairs of points 2\nand 5 (Fig. 5.11(b)) and 3 and 4 (Fig. 5.11(c)) have the same kind of symmetry differing\nonly by a phase rotation of ?. It is easily to understand the difference between the wave\nfunction symmetries for these two pairs of points 2 ? 5 and 3 ? 4, since they come from\nthe energy levels that possess the same feature. The energy levels for the points 2 and 5\nhave a decreasing tendency, while the points 3 and 4 are related to states that are split\nin energy. For the states with larger energy, more peaks are observed in the delocalized\nwave function, as already expected and as shown in Fig. 5.11(d) for the point 6 located\nclose to the upper zeroth Landau level and that presents two peaks.\n\nJust like in the armchair anti-dot case, the wave functions for the energy levels of the\nzigzag anti-dot inside the gap that exhibit a decreasing behaviour as the magnetic flux\nincrease are dot-localized states, as demonstrated by Fig. 5.12(a) for the point 7 in the\nenergy spectrum given by Fig. 5.10(d). In fact, the energy levels that appear intercepting\nthe decreasing dot-localized states are edge states, as demonstrated by Fig. 5.12(b) for\npoint 8. The three energy levels marked by point 8 have the same symmetry being just\nrotated by a phase of ?/3 due to the fact that a hexagon presents a C3 symmetry rotation\ngroup. Let us now check the total contribution |?1|2 +|?2|2 for the points 9 and 10 to find\n\n\n\n5.4. CONCLUSION 146\n\n(d)(c)\n\n(b)(a)\n\nFigure 5.12: (Color online) Squared total wave function |?|2 for the states indicated in\nFig. 5.10(d) for a system sketched in Fig. 5.1(a) with zigzag edges, such as the points\n7 ? 10 correspond to the plots (a) 7, (b) 8, (c) 9 and (d) 10. Small (large) circle with\nblue (red) color represents low (high) density. The bilayer region is shadowed by the gray\ncolor.\n\nthe origin of the topological protected states as emphasized in the yellow zoom region in\nFig. 5.10(c). The point 9 corresponds to a state that decreases in energy with B, whereas\nthe point 10 is located on the flat part for the same energy level. Just looking at the\nsquared modules of the wave functions for these two points, we can see that one of them\nis a mixed state of an edge state and a spread state, as given by Fig. 5.12(c) for the point\n9, while the wave function for the flat state denoted by 10 is only an edge state. Moreover,\nalthough it was not shown for the zigzag edge case, one can observe also that the energy\nlevels that approach the zeroth Landau levels that cross each other around energy E = 0\ncorrespond to states that are spread out throughout the whole bilayer system, as shown\nfor the armchair case in Fig. 5.11(d).\n\n5.4 Conclusion\n\nWe proposed two different type of QD systems composed of nanostructured bilayer\ngraphene. We presented a theoretical study of the energy levels within the tight-binding\napproach. The two proposed system are hexagonal bilayer quantum dots created by (i)\ncutting out atoms in the inner region of the top layer forming, in this way, an hexagonal\nbilayer anti-dot and (ii) a hexagonal flake at the top layer surrounded by a hexagonal\nregion of monolayer graphene at the bottom. We have obtained results for the energy\n\n\n\n5.4. CONCLUSION 147\n\nspectra for both quantum dots with armchair and zigzag edges and discussed localization\nof carriers in these MLG/BLG quantum dots, analyzing the energy spectra in the presence\nof a perpendicular magnetic field and a gate potential. Our numerical calculations also\nallow us to find the density probability and thus to check which states are dot-localized\nand which are localized outside the middle of the system.\n\nIn the absence of magnetic field we computed the energy levels as a function of the\nside length of the top hexagonal (anti-)dot for the (first) second proposed system. For\nthe anti-dot case, we considered the application of an external bias potential that opens\na gap in the energy spectrum only for the bilayer region. Two different sets of energy\nlevels are observed in this case, one of them inside the gap E ? [?V0,V0] and the other\nfor high energy values |E| &lt;?V0. The latter decreases with the dot size, converging\nto the energies E = V0 and E = ?V0 for positive and negative region of the spectrum,\nrespectively. The former depends on the edge termination, such that it has a mix of\ndecreasing and increasing levels with increasing size of the anti-dot with zigzag edges\nand only decreasing energy levels for the armchair case. We showed that the energy\nlevels inside the gap that decrease as the dot size increases are dot-localized states for\nthe both edge terminations, so that they are localized essentially on the bottom layer.\nIn addition, in zigzag anti-dot case we obtained many more states inside the gap region\nthat are increasing as the dot size also increases. These states correspond to edge states\nrelated to the anti-dot zigzag edges. Another feature observed in the zigzag system is the\nappearance of anti-crossings in the spectrum, related to the interplay between edges states\nin the zigzag edges near the MLG and BLG junction and states inside the dot confined\nby bias voltage.\n\nThe second proposed structure can be used as a type of hybrid MLG/BLG system\nto confine carriers. Even in the absence of external bias potential, it presents a strong\nlocalization in the middle of the system, as well as for smaller dot sizes the energy levels\nconverge to flat states that correspond to the monolayer energy levels, such that the\nelectron probability density is spread out along only the monolayer graphene flake.\n\nIn the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field we observed that the energy levels\napproach to the Landau levels in the both edge termination and also for both cases\nconsidering or not the effect of an applied bias potential. Similar way to hexagonal\nmonolayer graphene dots, we demonstrated that the energy spectrum as a function of the\nmagnetic flux possesses a gap for smaller values of magnetic flux in the armchair dot case\nand many zero energies in the zigzag case that correspond to edge states. Furthermore,\nthe energy spectrum for the unbiased case presents (i) an electron-hole symmetry and\n(ii) the appearance of several crossing and anti-crossings for both edge terminations that\ncan be linked to the interplay between the magnetic field confinement and the quantum\ndot confinement. For the biased quantum dot case, we found some states that exhibit\nbehaviour similar to topologically protected states, since that the properties of these state\ndo not change as the magnetic flux changes. We showed that these states are edge states\n\n\n\n5.4. CONCLUSION 148\n\nand they preserve this symmetry even when the magnetic flux increases. Other important\nconsequence of the combination of magnetic field and an electrostatic confinement is that\nit breaks the inversion symmetry of the bilayer such as the electron-hole symmetry is not\npreserved in the energy spectrum.\n\n\n\n6\nWave packet scattering on graphene edges in the\n\npresence of a (pseudo) magnetic field\n\nThe scattering of a Gaussian wave packet in armchair and zigzag graphene edges is\ntheoretically investigated by numerically solving the time dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nfor the tight-binding model Hamiltonian. Our theory allows to investigate scattering in\nreciprocal space, and depending on the type of graphene edge we observe scattering within\nthe same valley, or between different valleys. In the presence of an external magnetic field,\nthe well know skipping orbits are observed. However, our results demonstrate that in the\ncase of a pseudo-magnetic field, induced by non-uniform strain, the scattering by an\narmchair edge results in a non-propagating edge state.\n\n6.1 Motivation\n\nDue to its unique electronic properties, graphene has become a topic of intensive study\nin recent years. Within the low energy approximation for the tight-binding Hamiltonian\nof graphene, electrons behave as massless Dirac fermions, with a linear energy dispersion.\n[1] This leads to a plethora of interesting physical phenomena, ranging from Klein tunnel-\ning and other quasi-relativistic effects [124, 197] to the existence of new types of electron\ndegrees of freedom, namely, the pseudo-spin, related to the distribution of the wave func-\ntion over the carbon atoms belonging to the different triangular sublattices composing\nthe graphene hexagonal lattice, and the presence of two inequivalent electronic valleys,\nusually labeled as K and K\u2019, in the vicinity of the gapless points of the energy spectrum\nof graphene.\n\nRecent papers studied the scattering of electrons by edges [198] and defects [199] in\ngraphene, both theoretically [165] and experimentally [200]. Armchair and zigzag are the\ntwo types of edges which are most frequently considered in the study of graphene ribbons,\nalthough other types of terminations exist due to edge reconstruction, which has been\ndemonstrated both theoretically [201] and experimentally [202, 203, 204]. Even so, the\nedge reconstruction effect strongly depends on how the nanoribbon is made: normally, it\n\n\n\n6.1. MOTIVATION 150\n\noccurs when the technique used to fabricate the nanoribbon is based on a mechanism that\ndrives the system to thermodynamic equilibrium. According to the continuum (Dirac)\nmodel, armchair edges in finite graphene samples lead to a boundary condition that\nmixes the wavefunctions of K and K\u2019 valleys, whereas a zigzag edge appears in the Dirac\ntheory of graphene as a separate boundary condition for the wavefunctions of each valley.\n[90, 96] This suggests that electrons reflected by a graphene edge would exhibit inter-\nvalley scattering only in the armchair case, whereas reflection by a zigzag edge would\nproduce scattering inside the same Dirac valley. This prediction was confirmed by recent\nexperiments, [205] where inter-valley scattering by armchair edges was even shown to be\nvery robust in the presence of defects. The inter- and intra-valley scattering possibilities\nare schematically illustrated in Fig. 6.1(a), which shows K and K\u2019 Dirac cones in the\nreciprocal space of graphene.\n\nBesides its singular electronic properties, graphene also exhibits interesting mechan-\nical properties, as it can support strong elastic stretch. This provides us with the\nnew possibility to tune the electron properties in graphene through strain engineering.\n[74, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214] In fact, it has been demonstrated recently\nthat electrons in a strained graphene lattice behave as if they were under an external mag-\nnetic field, which points towards opposite directions in the K and K\u2019 valleys, so that the\ntime reversal symmetry of the system as a whole is preserved. [215, 216] Such fields were\nexperimentally observed recently, when measurements of the energy states in a graphene\nbubble revealed a Landau level-like structure corresponding to an external magnetic field\nof ? 300 T. [217] By designing non-uniform strain fields in a graphene sheet, one is able\nto produce a uniform pseudo-magnetic field for electrons.

EDGE-DEPENDENT SCATTERING 151\n\ninvestigate electron reflection by armchair and zigzag edges in a finite graphene sample,\nassumed to be made by cutting a graphene monolayer, such that no edge reconstruction\nis expected to occur at room temperature, where our results demonstrate the possibilities\nof inter- and intra-valley scattering, depending on the type of edge, and (ii) to study\nthe influence of an external magnetic field and a non-uniform strain distribution on the\nelectron trajectories in these systems. We compare the features observed for electrons\nunder a perpendicular external magnetic field with those seen with a pseudo-magnetic\nfield. Fig. 6.1(b) shows a sketch of the graphene flake considered in our calculations,\nwhere the open (green) circles illustrate the unstrained sample and the closed (black)\ncircles illustrate the strained one. Such a non-uniform strain field was suggested by\nGuinea et al. [218] and was shown to exhibit an almost uniform pseudo-magnetic field.\n\nAll the calculations were done within the tight-binding description of graphene, using\nthe time-evolution method developed in Ref. [131] and in the Chapter 2 of this thesis.\nAs we are not restricting ourselves to a single Dirac cone in our model, the scattering\nbetween Dirac cones by armchair edges will appear naturally. Notice that Fig. 6.1(b)\nis just an illustrative scheme of our system, where the number of atoms was reduced in\norder to help its visualization. Besides, the sample shown in Fig. 6.1(b) is a ribbon, which\nimproves the visualization of the strained case. However, the actual flake considered in\nour calculations has 1801\u00d72000 atoms, which looks more like a rectangle, rather than a\nribbon and corresponds to a flake with dimensions of about 426\u00d7221 nm2. Such a large\nflake is necessary to isolate each reflection of the wave packet on a single edge, as we need\nto consider a large packet in order to avoid dispersion. [131, 219]\n\n6.2 Edge-dependent scattering\n\nLet us first analyze the wave packet reflection by zigzag and armchair edges in a plain\ngraphene sample, i.e. in the absence of magnetic fields and strain. The initial wave packet\n?(x,y) is taken as a circularly symmetric gaussian distribution of width d, multiplied by\na plane wave with wave vector ~k = (kx,ky) and a pseudo-spinor ? = (A,B)\n\nT\n\n?(~r) =\n1\n\nd\n?\n2?\n\n(\nA\n\nB\n\n)\n\n\u00d7 exp\n[\n?\n(x ? x0)2 + (y ? y0)2\n\n2d2\n+ i~k.~r\n\n]\n. (6.1)\n\nThe pseudo-spinor in our model is simulated by defining a multiplication factor in the\nwave function, which assumes different values for sites belonging to the A and B sublat-\ntices. Notice that for low energy electrons in graphene, the tight-binding Hamiltonian can\nbe approximated as H = vF ~~k \u00b7~?, where vF is the Fermi velocity, so that the propagation\nvelocity vector in the Heisenberg picture is given by d~x/dt = ?[~x,H]i/~ = vF~?. Hence,\nthe pseudo-spin polarization of the wave packet plays an important role in defining the\n\n\n\n6.2. EDGE-DEPENDENT SCATTERING 152\n\ndirection of propagation. As the upper and right edges of the flake are of armchair and\nzigzag type, respectively, we consider ? = (1, i)T , i.e. propagation in the y-direction, in\norder to observe wave packet scattering on the upper armchair edge, and ? = (1, 1)T ,\ni.e. propagation in the x-direction, for scattering on the right zigzag edge. The ini-\ntial wave vector ~k is taken in the vicinity of the Dirac point ~K = (0, 4?\n\n/\n3\n?\n3a), where\n\na = 1.42\u00c5 is the inter-atomic distance. At each time step, we calculate the average\nvalues ?x? =\n\n? ?\n?? x|?|\n\n2dxdy and ?y? =\n? ?\n?? y|?|\n\n2dxdy, in order to track the wave packet\ntrajectory in real space. Besides, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the wave packet is\ntaken at each time step, in order to track its scattering in reciprocal space.\n\nThe average positions ?x? (black solid) and ?y? (red dashed) are shown in Fig. 6.2\nas a function of time, for a wave packet propagating in the x (y) direction, towards the\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.2: Average position of a gaussian wave packet of width d = 300 \u00c5 in an\nunstrained graphene flake, in the absence of external magnetic fields, as a function\nof time. (a) Horizontal propagation of a wave packet with ~k = (0.03\u00c5 ?1, 4?\n\n/\n3\n?\n3a),\n\nand its consequent reflection by a zigzag edge. In this case the origin of the system\nis shifted, so that the right zigzag edge is set as the x = 0 axis. The wave packet\nstarts at (x0,y0) = (?600\u00c5 , ?600\u00c5 ), and exhibits also a slow drag towards the upper\nedge, due to Zitterbewegung effects. (b) Vertical propagation of a wave packet with\n~k = (0, 4?\n\n/\n3\n?\n3a + 0.02\u00c5 ?1), starting at (0, ?600\u00c5 ), exhibiting reflection by the upper\n\narmchair border. In this case, the sample is not shifted, i.e. the upper edge is at the\ny = 0 axis, as sketched in Fig. 6.1(b).\n\n\n\n6.2. EDGE-DEPENDENT SCATTERING 153\n\nright zigzag (upper armchair) edge of the sample, and being reflected by this edge back\nto its initial position. Figs. 6.2(a) and (b) correspond to zigzag and armchair reflections,\nrespectively. The wave packet starts at 600 \u00c5 from the sample edge and reaches the edge\nat t ? 70 fs in both cases. Due to the finite width of the packet (d = 300 \u00c5 ), its center of\nmass never reaches the border [131], so that ?x? or ?y? start to exhibit backscattering when\nthey are still ? 150 \u00c5 far from the edge. Notice that the motion in the y?direction shown\nin Fig. 6.2(b) is perfectly vertical, i.e. ?x? = 0 during the whole propagation. However,\nthis is not the case for propagation in the x?direction as apparent in Fig. 6.2(a), which is\nnot perfectly horizontal, i.e. ?y? does not stay the same, as the wave packet slowly drags\ntowards larger y during propagation. This effect is a manifestation of the zitterbewegung,\nas discussed in detail in Ref. [131]. Although we did not manage to construct a wave\npacket that propagates perfectly horizontal, avoiding such a vertical drag, this effect does\nnot interfere in our results and conclusions, as our analysis of scattering on the zigzag\nedge depends only on the horizontal component of motion.\n\nOnce we know the instant when the wave packet is reflected by the graphene edge in\nreal space, at that moment we analyze what happens in reciprocal space. Fig. 6.3(a) shows\nthe lines (red dashed) in reciprocal space along which we will take the wave functions. The\ncontour plots in Fig. 6.3(b) illustrate the wave function along the horizontal line (i)?(ii)\ndepicted in Fig. 6.3(a) in reciprocal space, as time elapses, in the case of x-direction\npropagation and, consequently, zigzag edge reflection. For such a propagation direction,\nwe assumed the initial wave vector as ~k = (0.03\u00c5 ?1, 4?\n\n/\n3\n?\n3a). Therefore, the initial\n\nwave packet (at t = 0) has a peak around ki?iix = 0.03 \u00c5\n?1. This peak is conserved until\n\nthe wave packet starts to be reflected by the right zigzag edge, when interference patterns\nstart to show up. At ? 70 fs, a peak at ki?iix = ?0.03 \u00c5 ?1 starts to appear, while the\nformer peak at ki?iix = 0.03 \u00c5\n\n?1 smoothly decays. This is indeed the instant when the\nwave packet is reflected by the zigzag edge in real space, as shown in Fig. 6.2(a). As time\nelapses, the wave packet ends up only around ki?iix = ?0.03 \u00c5 ?1. This is direct evidence\nof intra-valley scattering as schematically illustrated in Fig. 6.1(a).\n\nFigs. 6.3(c) and (d) show the wave function in reciprocal space taken along the vertical\nline (iii) ? (iv) depicted in Fig. 6.3(a) as time elapses, for vertical propagation and,\nconsequently, armchair edge reflection. For propagation in the y-direction, we consider\n~k = (0, 4?\n\n/\n3\n?\n3a + 0.02\u00c5 ?1), so that the wave packet initially exhibits a peak around\n\n? 1.723 \u00c5 ?1, as shown in Fig. 6.3(c). This peak is preserved up to t ? 70 fs, when the\nwave packet is scattered by the upper armchair edge (see Fig. 6.2(b)) and the amplitude\nof the peak starts to decrease. Meanwhile, another peak appears around kiii?ivy ? ?1.723\n\u00c5 ?1, which is located in the K\u2019 valley, as shown in Fig. 6.1(a). The inter-valley scattering\nsituation is illustrated by the green circles in Fig. 6.1(a) which is clearly observed in\nreciprocal space.\n\n\n\n6.3.

The trajectory drawn by ~r = (?x?, ?y?) for such a packet in\nthe xy-plane after a t = 2000 fs propagation, under a ?5 T field, is shown in Fig. 6.4(a),\nwhere skipping orbits are clearly observed, [220] coming from the successive reflections at\nthe borders of the system, followed by ciclotronic semi-circles, as one would expect from\nsuch a scattering problem. The arrows indicate the direction of propagation, and the\nedges of the figure are set to be exactly at the position of the edges of the graphene flake.\nIn order to help their analysis, the trajectories where divided into four regions, labeled\nfrom (I) to (V). Fig. 6.4(b) shows ?x? and ?y? separately as a function of time, where one\nverifies e.g. the attachment of the packet to the upper edge (?y? close to y = 0 in region\n\n\n\n6.3.

As previously mentioned, due to the finiteness of the\npacket width, the trajectory as described by (?x?, ?y?) does not reach the edges of the\nsystem. Besides, the wave packet disperses as time elapses, which distorts the trajectory\nas compared to the one obtained by classical ballistic motion. [131] Even so, the main\nconclusion one draws from this result is quite clear: as well as in ordinary systems with\nconfined Schr\u00f6dinger particles, [221] electrons in graphene under external magnetic fields\nexhibit a skipping orbit pattern when propagating close to the edges of the sample. We\nperformed calculations for different wave packet widths d = 100 \u00c5 and 300 \u00c5 , and the\nresults lead to the same qualitative conclusion, differing only by the distance the wave\npacket may reach the edge. There is, however, an important difference between these\nskipping orbits and those in ordinary Schr\u00f6dinger systems, namely, the wave packet in\nthis case may scatter not only between momentum states with opposite signs within the\nsame valley, as usual, but they can also scatter from one valley to another, depending on\n\n\n\n6.3. SKIPPING ORBITS 156\n\nthe type of edge, as we demonstrated in Fig. 6.3. Nevertheless, the effect of an external\nmagnetic field on electron states belonging to both valleys is the same, therefore, there is\nno detectable manifestation of inter-valley scattering in this situation. This is not the case\nwhen, instead of an external magnetic field, we consider a strain induced pseudo-magnetic\nfield, as we will demonstrate in what follows.\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 6.5: (a) Trajectories drawn by ?x? and ?y? for a t = 2000 fs time evolution of a\nwave packet, which propagates close to the upper (armchair) border of a bent rectangular\ngraphene sample, for two values of wave packet width d. The radius of the circular\ndistortion is R = 104 \u00c5 , corresponding to an almost uniform ? 5 T pseudo-magnetic\nfield. The horizontal dashed line represents the upper edge of the sample. (b) Average\nvalues of the wave packet position ?x? and ?y? as a function of time for the trajectories\ndrawn in (a).\n\nFor a circularly strained graphene flake, like that sketched in Fig. 6.1(b), electrons in\nthe sample behave as if they were in an almost uniform magnetic field perpendicular to\nthe plane. In order to produce such a strain, our 1801 \u00d7 2000 atoms sample is distorted\ninto a semi-circle of radius R = 104 \u00c5 , leading to a pseudo-magnetic field ? 5 T, i.e.\nclose to the value considered for the external magnetic field in Fig. 6.4. The presence of\nsuch a pseudo-magnetic field when electrons move close to the edge are expected to result\nin skipping orbits, similar to those in Fig. 6.4. Surprisingly, Fig. 6.5(a) shows this is not\nreally the case: after performing a semi-circular trajectory due to the Lorentz force coming\n\n\n\n6.3. SKIPPING ORBITS 157\n\nfrom the pseudo-magnetic field, the packet, which started in the K valley, is reflected by\nthe upper armchair edge and scatters to the K\u2019 valley, where the pseudo-magnetic field\npoints in the opposite direction. The semi-circular trajectory now travels in the opposite\ndirection until the packet reaches the edge again, being scattered back to its former Dirac\ncone at the K valley. This procedure occurs several times until the packet is so strongly\ndispersed that it, eventually, does not reach any of the edges, and performs only circular\ntrajectories in the middle of the graphene flake. The series of reflections by the armchair\nborder obtained in the strained case suggests the existence of a quasi-bound state at this\nedge, which is clearly seen by the time-dependence of the average coordinates ?x? and ?y?,\nshown in Fig. 6.5(b). As time elapses, both ?x? and ?y? simply oscillate around x = 0\nand close to the upper border of the sample, respectively. Notice that differently from\nFig. 6.4(a), the lateral and bottom borders of the panel in Fig. 6.5(a) do not match the\nedges of the sample, in order to help the visualization of the trajectory, which in this\ncase is localized in a small region of the sample. One can also observe that the results for\ndifferent wave packet widths d are qualitatively the same, differing only by the amplitudes\nof the ?x? and ?y? oscillations in time.\n\n(b)(a)\n\nFigure 6.6: Contour plots of the time evolution of the wave packet in reciprocal space\ncorresponding to the propagation shown in Fig. 6.5, i.e. for a strained graphene sample.\nThe Fourier transform of the wave packet is taken in the vicinity of the (a) K and (b)\nK\u2019 points of the reciprocal space illustrated in Fig. 6.3(a), along the kx = ?0.06\u00c5 ?1\n(kx = 0.045\u00c5 ?1) vertical axis for K (K\u2019).\n\nThe sequence of scatterings between K and K\u2019 valleys suggested by the trajectories\nobserved in Fig. 6.5 is confirmed by a direct observation of the wavefunction in reciprocal\nspace. This is illustrated by Fig. 6.6, which shows the Fourier-transformed wavefunction\n(contour plots) as a function of the vertical component of the wave vector ky as function\nof time t, similar to Figs. 6.3 (c) and (d). Since the initial wave packet in this case is at\n~k = (?0.06\u00c5 ?1, 4?\n\n/\n3\n?\n3a), in the vicinity of the K point, the ky in Fig. 6.6(a) is taken\n\nfor a fixed kx = ?0.06 \u00c5 ?1, i.e. in the center of the initial wave packet. One clearly\nsees that the peak of the wave packet in reciprocal space oscillates between the K (a) and\nK\u2019 (b) regions in Fig. 6.6 as time elapses, as a consequence of the successive inter-valley\n\n\n\n6.4. PROBABILITY DENSITY CURRENT CALCULATIONS 158\n\nscatterings by the upper armchair edge of the system, as observed in Fig. 6.5. Indeed,\nthe first peak in the K\u2019 cone (Fig. 6.6(b)), for instance, starts to appear at t ? 200 fs,\nwhich is the same time when ?x? and ?y? start to decrease in Fig. 6.5(b), after the wave\npacket is scattered by the edge for the first time. It is important to point out that we\nhad to take the kx = 0.045 \u00c5 ?1 vertical axis in order to observe the K\u2019 propagation in\nFig. 6.6(b), instead of the kx = 0.06 \u00c5 ?1 that would be expected from the value of the\nwave vector in our initial wave packet. In fact, one cannot expect that the K and K\u2019\npoints in the strained case remain vertically aligned in reciprocal space, as illustrated in\nFig. 6.3(a), due to the distortion of the Dirac cones caused by the strain. [217] Also, we\nobserve that the scattered wave packets are no longer gaussian, as they start to exhibit\ninterference patterns due to the scattering by the edges. Even so, the conclusions drawn\nfrom the results in Fig. 6.6 are not affected by this fact, while Fig. 6.6 gives us a clear\ndemonstration that the successive K to K\u2019 scatterings are indeed strongly related to the\nnon-propagating edge states found for the strained case in Fig. 6.5.\n\n6.4 Probability density current calculations\n\nThe trajectories illustrated in Figs. 6.4 and 6.5 have a direct effect on the probability\ndensity currents, which are numerically calculated based on the method developed in Ref.\n[222]. Since we can define the probability current j in terms of the continuity equation,\nthen the discrete current centered on site n can be written as\n\njn ? jn+1 = a\n?\n\n?t\n?n,n, (6.2)\n\nwhere ?n,n = ?n|??|n? are the matrix elements of the density matrix operator ?? = |????|,\nand the time derivative is determined by the equation of motion for ??\n\n?\n\n?t\n?nn =\n\ni\n\n~\n\n?\n\nm\n\n(?n?\n?\nmHmn ? Hnm?m??n) (6.3)\n\nwhere ?n = ?n|??. We will limit ourselves to the case of nearest-neighbor interaction,\ni.e. Hn,m = 0 when |m ? n| > 1, from which we obtain\n\n?\n\n?t\n?nn =\n\ni\n\n~\n\n[(\n?n?\n\n?\nn+1Hn+1,n ? Hn,n+1?n+1??n\n\n)]\n\n+\ni\n\n~\n\n[\n?n?\n\n?\nn?1Hn?1,n ? Hn,n?1?n?1??n\n\n]\n, (6.4)\n\nwhich is easily rewritten in the form\n\n?\n\n?t\n?nn = ?\n\n2\n\n~\n?\n[\n?n?\n\n?\nn+1Hn+1,n\n\n]\n\n+\n2\n\n~\n? [?n?1??nHn,n?1] . (6.5)\n\nBy comparing Eqs. (6.2) and (6.5), one easily identifies the local current in n as\n\njn =\n2a\n\n~\n? [??n?n?1Hn,n?1] . (6.6)\n\n\n\n6.4. PROBABILITY DENSITY CURRENT CALCULATIONS 159\n\nNotice that Eq. (6.6) was developed without taking into account any specific lattice\nand the presence of magnetic fields. However, a generalization to arbitrary discrete lattice\nis straightforward, and the presence of a magnetic field is included simply by the Peierls\nsubstitution of the hopping parameters. [223] As graphene is a hexagonal lattice, the\ncurrent components in x and y directions have different forms and are site dependent.\nDefining the sites location through their line (n) and column (m) positions in the lattice\n(see Ref. [131]), one obtains\n\njx(n,m) = \u00b1\na\n\n~\n\n{\n2?\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn,m\u00b11?n,m\u00b11\n\n]\n\n??\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn?1,m?n?1,m\n\n]\n? ?\n\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn+1,m?n+1,m\n\n]}\n(6.7)\n\nand\n\njy(n,m) =\n\n?\n3a\n\n~\n\n{\n?\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn+1,m?n+1,m\n\n]\n\n??\n[\n?n,m?\n\n?\nn?1,m?n?1,m\n\n]}\n(6.8)\n\nwhere the ? sign in jx will be positive (negative) if the (n,m)-site belongs to the sub-\nlattice A (B), and ?n,m is the hopping parameter which, in the presence of a mag-\nnetic field, includes an additional phase according to the Peierls substitution ?n,m ?\n?n,m exp\n\n[\nie\n~\n\n? n\nm\n~A \u00b7 d~l\n\n]\n, where ~A is the vector potential describing the magnetic field.\n\nThe probability density currents calculated by Eq. (6.6) are integrated in space and\nplotted as a function of time in Fig. 6.7 for the situations proposed in Figs. 6.4 and\n6.5, i.e. (a) in the presence of an external 5 T magnetic field, and (b) in a strained\ngraphene sample, which produces an almost uniform ? 5 T pseudo-magnetic field. As\nin the other results discussed previously, the results obtained for the two different values\nof wave packet width considered in this case, d = 100 \u00c5 (black solid - circles) and\nd = 300 \u00c5 (red dashed - triangles), exhibit similar qualitative features, differing only in\na quantitative way. In Fig. 6.7(a), for an external field, one observes a total current flow\nin the x-direction oscillating around a positive value in the region I, whereas jy oscillates\naround zero in this region. This is a manifestation of the propagation of the wave packet\nthrough the upper edge of the sample, by means of skipping orbits, as illustrated in Fig.\n6.4(a). What follows can also be understood by analyzing Fig. 6.4(a): In regions II and\nIV (III and V), where the wave packet propagates along the vertical (horizontal) edges,\nthe component of the current in the y(x)-direction oscillates around a non-zero value,\nindicating an electron propagation through the sample by the skipping orbits mechanism.\nThis is not the case when we consider a strain-induced pseudo-magnetic field: Fig. 6.7(b)\nshows that both jx and jy always oscillating around zero, confirming that there is no net\ncurrent in the system and that the skipping orbits near the armchair edge in this case are\nnon-propagating states.\n\nThe results found in our work have observable consequences in experiments. For ex-\nample, the edge propagation of electrons through skipping orbits in an ordinary system\n\n\n\n6.4.

The curves (symbols)\nrepresent the component of the current in the x (y)-direction, i.e. jx (jy). Two different\nvalues of wave packet width are considered: d = 100 \u00c5 (black solid - circles) and 300 \u00c5\n(red dashed - triangles) The regions delimited in (a) are the same as in Fig. 6.4.\n\nunder an external magnetic field plays an important role in electron transport in the\ndirection parallel to the edge. [221] Our results demonstrate that these skipping orbits\nare still present in a graphene ribbon under an external magnetic field, but they are not\nobserved in the case of pseudo-magnetic fields in the direction parallel to an armchair\nborder of graphene. This is a clear example that the pseudo-magnetic field has different\nconsequences as compared to a real magnetic field. Therefore, in a strained armchair\ngraphene ribbon, edge electrons should not propagate along the ribbon, so that the trans-\nport in these systems must be dominated only by electrons propagating far from the edge.\nMoreover, the non-propagating state found at the armchair edge of a strained sample is\na consequence of periodic inter-valley scattering processes, and this type of scattering\nhas an important effect on Raman spectroscopy. [224] Therefore, the successive electron\nreflections at the armchair edge of a strained sample would manifests itself as an intense\npeak in Raman experiments taken close to the border of the graphene sample.\n\n\n\n6.5. CONCLUSION 161\n\n6.5 Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we investigated the reflection of a wave packet on zigzag and armchair\nedges of a graphene ribbon. Our results demonstrate the scattering of the wave packet\nfrom K to K\u2019 Dirac cones in the case of armchair edges, whereas scattering from posi-\ntive to negative average momentum inside the same cone is observed in the zigzag case,\nwhich is in agreement with predictions from mean field (Dirac) theory of graphene and\nwith recent experimental results. [205] In the presence of an external magnetic field,\nskipping orbits are observed. However, for a strain induced pseudo-magnetic field, our\nnumerical results demonstrate that the incoming and scattered wave packets perform or-\nbits in opposite directions in the armchair case. This effect is easy to be understood if\none considers the combination between two events, both already predicted by the Dirac\ntheory of graphene: (i) the K to K\u2019 scattering by armchair edges and (ii) the opposite\nsign of the pseudo-magnetic field in the different cones. This result points directly to the\npossibility of observing non-propagating edge states in an armchair terminated strained\ngraphene sample under pseudo-magnetic fields, which is completely different from the ex-\nternal magnetic fields case, where the skipping orbit states are always propagating. The\neffects predicted by our theoretical work are expected to have important consequences in\nfuture experiments on strained graphene samples.\n\n\n\n7\nValley filtering using electrostatic potentials in\n\nbilayer graphene\n\nPropagation of an electron wave packet through a quantum point contact (QPC)\ndefined by electrostatic gates in bilayer graphene is investigated. The gates are set as to\nprovide a bias between the layers, in order to produce an energy gap. If the gates on both\nsides of the contact produce the same bias, steps in the electron transmission probability\nare observed, as in an usual QPC. However, if the bias is inverted on one of the sides of\nthe QPC, only electrons belonging to one of the Dirac valleys are allowed to pass, which\nprovides a very efficient valley filtering.\n\n7.1 Motivation\n\nThe unique band structure of graphene has brought the possibility of developing de-\nvices based on different degrees of freedom, other than charge (electronics) and spin (spin-\ntronics), namely, using its different pseudo-spin states (pseudo-spintronics) and electronic\nvalleys (valleytronics). Valley filtering in graphene has been pursued by many researchers,\nas a path to use the valley degree of freedom of electrons in this material as the basis\nfor future valley-tronics. Previous theoretical proposals for valley filtering demand a high\ncontrol of the atomic structure of the graphene layer, either by cutting it in specific direc-\ntions as to produce uniform zigzag edges [225], or by applying stress in a specific manner\nin order to obtain an almost uniform pseudo-magnetic field [131, 226, 227], or even by\ntaking advantage of the valley filtering process that occurs when an electron propagates\nthrough a line of heptagon-pentagon defects on the honeycomb lattice.[199, 228, 229]\n\nMonolayer graphene is gapless and therefore its usage in electronic devices is un-\nfavourable. [1] In bilayer graphene on the other hand, a gap may be opened by applying\na bias between the two layers.[79] Therefore, in bilayer graphene, it is possible to produce\nelectrostatic confined structures, such as quantum wires, dots and rings.[121, 154, 155,\n156, 160, 166] A special case of quantum wire confinement occurs when one applies oppo-\nsite bias on the different sides of the quantum wire potential: in this case, one dimensional\n\n\n\n7.2. SPLIT-OPERATOR TECHNIQUE FOR THE BILAYER GRAPHENE HAMILTONIAN 163\n\nuni-directional chiral states are created, whose subband structures along the free direction\nfor K and K? valleys are mirror symmetric. [230, 231, 232] In the present chapter we will\nuse the latter property to propose a novel valley filter, which is solely based on the use of\nelectrostatic potentials and we do not require any complicated tailoring of the graphene\nlattice as needed in previous proposed filters.\n\nIn this chapter, we demonstrate that a quantum point contact (QPC) defined by\nelectrostatic gates in bilayer graphene, as sketched in Fig. 7.1(a), exhibits steps in its\ntransmission probabilities as the energy of the incident electron increases, just like in an\nordinary point contact. On the other hand, valley polarized current is predicted when\nthe sides of the point contact have opposite bias, as sketched in Fig. 7.1(b). The specific\nconditions for such polarization are discussed in detail in Sec. 7.3. In Sec. 7.2 we present\nour technique to solve the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation based on a tight-binding\nmodel. The numerical results are presented in Sec. 7.3 and we summarize our discussion\ngiving the main conclusions in Sec. 7.4.\n\nFigure 7.1: Sketch of the QPC structure, forming a channel with length L and width\nW , with (a) aligned and (b) anti-aligned bias.

In order to do so, we solve the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the\ntight-binding Hamiltonian of bilayer graphene in order to investigate the time evolution\nof a wave packet describing an electron propagating through a quantum point contact.\n\nThe time evolution of a quantum state is described by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation given by\n\n?(~r,t) = U?(t, t0)?(~r,t0), (7.1)\n\nwhere U?(t, t0) is known as the time evolution operator. For the case in which the Hamil-\ntonian does not explicitly depend on time, this operator can be written as U?(t, t0) =\n\n\n\n7.2.

Different techniques to expand this exponential operator are found\n\nin the literature, for example iterative methods based on the Crank-Nicholson scheme\nand the Chebyschev polynomials method. Furthermore for systems with moderate space\ndimensions there is the possibility to solve this problem by brute force, using full diago-\nnalisation [233]. Here, we opted for the split-operator technique [131].\n\nOur approach is based on the tight-binding model for the description of an electron\nin bilayer graphene. We consider respectively n and m as the row and column indexes to\nlocate a particular site in the lattice, and l = {1, 2} index corresponds to bottom and top\nlayers, respectively. The basis vector state is defined as |n,m,l?. So, the tight-binding\nHamiltonian reads\n\nHTB|n,m,l? ?= (En,m,l + Vn,m,l)|n,m,l?\n+ ?n?1,m|n ? 1,m,l? + ?n+1,m|n + 1,m,l?\n+ ?n,m?1|n,m ? 1, l? + ?n,m+1|n,m + 1, l?\n+ ?n,m|n,m,l + 1? + ?n,m|n,m,l ? 1?, (7.2)\n\nwhere ?n,m?1 and ?n,m are the intra- and inter-layer hopping energies between the sites,\nrespectively. The tight-binding Hamiltonian for bilayer graphene in matrix form is now\nrepresented by two pentadiagonal matrices in blocks, connected by two diagonal matrices.\nTo numerically simplify the problem, which is important when dealing with large systems,\nwe first rewrite Eq. (7.2) as follows\n\nHTB|n,m,l? = Hn,l|n,m,l? + Hm,l|n,m,l? + Hn,m|n,m,l?, (7.3)\n\nwhere the operators Hn,l, Hm,l and Hn,m are defined as\n\nHn,l|n,m,l? =\n(\n?n,m,l + Vn,m,l\n\n2\n\n)\n|n,m,l?\n\n+ ?n,m?1|n,m ? 1, l? + ?n,m+1|n,m + 1, l?, (7.4)\n\nHm,l|n,m,l? =\n(\n?n,m,l + Vn,m,l\n\n2\n\n)\n|n,m,l?\n\n+ ?n?1,m|n ? 1,m,l? + ?n+1,m|n + 1,m,l? (7.5)\n\nand\n\nHn,m|n,m,l? = ?n,m|n,m,l + 1? + ?n,m|n,m,l ? 1?. (7.6)\n\nIn doing so, we split the Hamiltonian and thus transform the problem of pentadiagonal\nmatrices in blocks into a series of calculations involving only products of tridiagonal\nmatrices, which are much easier to handle with known computational routines.\n\nSubsequently, the time evolution operator is expanded as follows\n\ne?(i/~)HT B ?t = e?(i/2~)Hn,m?te?(i/2~)Hm,l?te?(i/~)Hn,l?t\n\n\u00d7 e?(i/2~)Hm,l?te?(i/2~)Hn,m?t + O(?t3), (7.7)\n\n\n\n7.2. SPLIT-OPERATOR TECHNIQUE FOR THE BILAYER GRAPHENE HAMILTONIAN 165\n\nand we neglect terms of order O(?t3) which correspond to the non-commutativity between\nthe operators Hn,l, Hm,l and Hn,m. Higher accuracy is realised by considering a smaller\ntime step. Here, we took ?t = 0.1 fs. Using the well-known property of the Pauli matrices\n\nexp\n[\n?i~A \u00b7 ~?\n\n]\n= cos(A)I ? isin(A)\n\nA\n\n(\nAz Ax ? iAy\n\nAx + iAy ?Az\n\n)\n, (7.8)\n\nfor any vector ~A, where A = | ~A| and I is the identity matrix, and realising that the\nHn,m operator for each n and m fixed is just a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix with zero-diagonal elements\ndescribed by ?n,m?x, we have that the exponential of Hn,m is given exactly by\n\ne?(i/2~)?n,m?x?t =\n\n(\ncos(Ax) ?isin(Ax)\n\n?isin(Ax) cos(Ax)\n\n)\n= Ml, (7.9)\n\nwhere Ax = ?n,m?t/2~.\nThe wave function at time step t + ?t is then given by\n\n|?n,m,l?t+?t ?= e?(i/2~)Hn,m?te?(i/2~)Hm,l?te?(i/~)Hn,l?t\n\n\u00d7 e?(i/2~)Hm,l?te?(i/2~)Hn,m?t|?n,m?t, (7.10)\n\nthat can be developed in five steps\n\n?n,m,l = e\n?(i/2~)Hn,m?t|?n,m,l?t, (7.11)\n\n?n,m,l = e\n?(i/2~)Hm,l?t?n,m,l, (7.12)\n\n?n,m,l = e\n?(i/~)Hn,l?t?n,m,l, (7.13)\n\n?n,m,l = e\n?(i/2~)Hm,l?t?n,m,l, (7.14)\n\n|?n,m,l?t+?t = e?(i/2~)Hn,m?t?n,m,l, (7.15)\n\nwhere at each step we use the Cayley equation for the exponentials [234], such that\n\n?n,m,l = Ml|?n,m,l?t,\n(\n1 +\n\ni?t\n\n4~\nHm,l\n\n)\n?n,m,l =\n\n(\n1 ? i?t\n\n4~\nHm,l\n\n)\n?n,m,l,\n\n(\n1 +\n\ni?t\n\n2~\nHn,l\n\n)\n?n,m,l =\n\n(\n1 ?\n\ni?t\n\n2~\nHn,l\n\n)\n?n,m,l,\n\n(\n1 +\n\ni?t\n\n4~\nHm,l\n\n)\n?n,m,l =\n\n(\n1 ? i?t\n\n4~\nHm,l\n\n)\n?n,m,l,\n\n|?n,m,l?t+?t = Ml?n,m,l. (7.16)\n\nThe problem is now strongly simplified because now we have to deal only with tridiagonal\nmatrices. We propagate a Gaussian wave packet following this numerical procedure and\ncalculate the transmission probability by integrating the squared modulus of the wave\n\n\n\n7.2. SPLIT-OPERATOR TECHNIQUE FOR THE BILAYER GRAPHENE HAMILTONIAN 166\n\npacket only in the region of the bilayer which is after the QPC. The initial Gaussian wave\npacket is defined as:\n\n?0(~r) =\n1\n\nd\n?\n2?\n\n?\n????\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA?\n\nB?\n\n?\n????\n\n\u00d7 exp\n[\n?(x ? x0)\n\n2 + (y ? y0)2\n2d2\n\n+ i~k \u00b7 ~r\n]\n. (7.17)\n\nThe coefficients A(A?) and B(B?) in the pseudospinor are related to the probability of\nfinding the electron in each triangular sublattice A(A?) and B(B?) of the graphene lattice\nin a given layer. For the bilayer case, we choose the same pseudospinor for both layers,\nsince the total wave function is composed of two Gaussian wave packets, one in each\nlayer, with the same properties, as initial momentum, initial energy and initial position\nof Gaussian center ~r0 = (x0,y0) in real space. The pseudospinor is characterised by the\npseudospin polarization angle ?, such as\n\n(\n1 , ei?\n\n)T\n. Thus the pseudospin polarization has\n\na conceptual connection with the direction of propagation of the wave packet in the tight-\nbinding model and the choice of the angle ? depends also on which Dirac valley the initial\nwave packet is taken[130, 131]. We take ? = 0(?) for an initial wave packet starting from\nK(K?) valley, since we want it to propagate in the y-direction. The initial wave vector is\n~k = (k0x,k\n\n0\ny)+K, which is shifted with respect to the Dirac points, where K represents the\n\ntwo non-equivalent K and K? points that are located at (0, \u00b14?/3\n?\n3a), with a = 0.142 nm\n\nbeing the in plane inter-atomic distance. For our numerical calculations, the initial wave\npacket energy E is set by k, the modulus of the wave vector, once that the bottom of the\nlow-energy bands may be approximated by[79] E = ?(??/2)\n\n(?\n1 + 4(vF ~k/??)2 ? 1\n\n)\n,\n\nin bilayer graphene, where ?? ? 0.4 eV is the interlayer coupling corresponding to per-\npendicular hopping between the Bernal stacked layers and vF ? 106 m/s is the Fermi\nvelocity. The width of the Gaussian wave packet was taken as d = 20 nm and its initial\nposition as (x0,y0) = (0, ?42) nm.\n\nAn important remark concerning the wave packet dynamics is about the oscillatory\nbehavior of the velocity, i.e. the zitterbewegung manifestation on the wave packet motion\n[131, 197]. We shall show that it can not be avoided for motion of an electron in bilayer\ngraphene that propagates in the y-direction. To understand how this affects the velocity\nin the y-direction, we use the Dirac Hamiltonian for electrons in bilayer graphene in the\nvicinity of the K point[79]\n\nHBID =\n\n?\n????\n\n0 vF? ?? 0\nvF?\n\n\u2020 0 0 0\n?? 0 0 vF?\u2020\n\n0 0 vF? 0\n\n?\n????\n, (7.18)\n\nwhere ? = px + ipy and ?\u2020 = px ? ipy are the momentum operators in Cartesian coor-\ndinates, and calculate the commutator [HBID ,v\n\nBI\ny ]. According to the Heisenberg picture,\n\n\n\n7.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 167\n\nthe velocity in the y-direction is given by\n\nvy =\ndy\n\ndt\n=\n\n1\n\ni~\n[HD,y]. (7.19)\n\nReplacing HBID into Eq. (7.19) and using the well-known commutation relation [xi,pj] =\ni~?ij we find\n\nvBIy =\n\n?\n????\n\n0 ivF 0 0\n\n?ivF 0 0 0\n0 0 0 ?ivF\n0 0 ivF 0\n\n?\n????\n. (7.20)\n\nNow we shall verify whether vBIy is a constant of motion or not, and if there is any\nsituation where the velocity is not affected by the zitterbewegung in the y-direction.\nEvaluating [HBID ,v\n\nBI\ny ] by making use of Eqs. (7.18) and (7.20), one obtains\n\n[HBID ,v\nBI\ny ] =\n\n?\n????\n\n?2iv2Fpx 0 0 ?i??vF\n0 2iv2Fpx i??vF 0\n\n0 i??vF 2iv\n2\nFpx 0\n\n?i??vF 0 0 ?2iv2F px\n\n?\n????\n, (7.21)\n\nsuggesting that even if px = 0, one has [HBID ,v\nBI\ny ] 6= 0, implying that vy is not a constant\n\nof motion, because we are still left with non-zero off-diagonal terms. Conversely, in\nthe monolayer case, we obtain that the velocity in the y-direction is expressed by vMOy =\n?vF?y, where ?y is the y Pauli matrix and with the monolayer Hamiltonian being HMOD =\nvF~? \u00b7 ~p. Following the same procedure as for bilayer graphene, we obtain\n\n[HMOD ,v\nMO\ny ] =\n\n(\n?2iv2Fpx 0\n\n0 2iv2Fpx\n\n)\n, (7.22)\n\nand thus [HMOD ,v\nMO\ny ] = 0 if px = 0. Therefore, there is no way to avoid the trembling\n\nmotion at small times for the wave packet propagation in bilayer graphene - even for\nmotion in the y-direction, i. e. k0x = 0 and k\n\n0\ny 6= 0, the wave packet will also move in the\n\nx-direction. For this reason, all presented results in this chapter are normalized for the\nmaximum transmission obtained for the case in the absence of any potential.\n\n7.3 Results and discussion\n\nIn order to better understand our tight-binding results, let us first investigate the\nenergy dispersions in a BLG quantum wire defined by aligned (Fig. 7.1(a)) and anti-\naligned (Fig. 7.1(b)) potential barriers, as obtained by the Dirac approximation for BLG,\nusing the 4\u00d74 Hamiltonian. [79] These spectra are shown in Figs. 7.2(a) and 7.2(b),\nrespectively, for different values of well width. Only states with energy below the barrier\nheight (V0 = 200 meV) are shown. Notice the qualitative difference between the two\n\n\n\n7.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 168\n\nspectra. The energy dispersion in the former case exhibits symmetry with respect to\npositive and negative values of the wave vector in the propagation direction ky. As\nthe propagation velocity is obtained from vg = ?E/?py, with py = ~ky, this spectrum\nsuggests that wave packets may propagate towards either positive or negative y-direction,\nprovided the average wave vector ky of the wave packet is in a region of positive or\nnegative derivative of the spectrum, respectively. On the other hand, the spectra for the\nanti-aligned case does not exhibit the same symmetry. Besides, low energy electrons in\nthis system can only exhibit positive velocity of propagation, since the derivative of the\nspectrum around E = 0 is positive for any value of ky. In fact, this spectrum is obtained\nfor the BLG Dirac Hamiltonian for electrons around the K point of the first Brillouin\nzone. The spectrum for K? is obtained just by replacing ky by ?ky in Fig. 7.2(b), or,\nequivalently by inverting the polarization of all gates in Fig. 7.1(b).\n\nFigure 7.2: Band structure for the two potential configurations sketched in Fig. 7.1,\nnamely, (a) aligned and (b) anti-aligned potential barriers. Results are presented for\nV0 = 200 meV and three values for the quantum well width W = 5 (black solid), 10 (red\ndashed) and 20 nm, (blue dotted).\n\nDue to the fact that the low energy spectra for the aligned bias case in K and K? points\nhave the EK(K?)(kx,ky) = EK(K?)(?kx,ky) and EK(kx,ky) = EK?(kx, ?ky) symmetries, the\ntransmission probabilities are the same no matter if the wave packet started in K or K?\n\nvalley. This is verified in Fig. 7.3, which shows the transmission probability as a function\nof the wave packet energy, for different configurations of the channel defined by aligned\npotentials, as sketched in Fig. 7.1(a). Results for K and K? valleys in this case are exactly\nthe same. Steps are observed in the transmission probabilities as the wave packet energy\nincreases. This is a well known feature of any QPC, which is related to the existence of\nquantized energy levels inside the channel - whenever the energy crosses one of the energy\nlevels, a step is produced. In fact, although not shown in the Fig. 7.3, we verify that\nincreasing W moves the steps to lower E, just as expected for an usual QPC, once that\n\n\n\n7.3.

The\nvalue for width of the QPC was considered W = 10 nm. The square and circular symbols\ncorrespond to the lengths L = 5 and 20 nm, respectively.\n\nthe energy of the quantized states of the channel decreases as W increases. The figure\nshows that as L varies the position of the step does not change, but for smaller L, the\nsteps are less pronounced.\n\nSimilar features are observed in the anti-aligned case, though with a fundamental\ndifference - results for K and K? in this case are very different, as one can verify by\ncomparing Figs. 7.4(a) and 7.4(b), respectively. This is a clear manifestation of the lack\nof inter-valley symmetry exhibited by the band structure shown in Fig. 7.2(b). Such\na difference between transmission probabilities in different valleys suggests the use of\nthis system as a valley filter. However, in order to do so, we should seek for the best\nconfiguration of the system that enhances valley polarization.\n\nFigure 7.5 shows the transmission probabilities (upper panels) and the valley polar-\nization (lower panels) for the anti-aligned system of Fig. 7.1(b) as a function of the bias\npotential V0, for different values of W and L, considering a wave packet energy E = 30\nmeV. Once the wave packet is initially injected in the lowest subband of the energy spec-\ntrum (Fig. 7.2), then we limit ourselves to the lowest QPC steps. Valley polarization is\ndefined as P = 1?TK?/TK, where TK(K?) is the transmission probability for a wave packet\nstarting at the K(K?) Dirac points, so that P = 1 (0) means a wave packet completely\n(un)polarized in K after the QPC. Transmission probabilities in all cases are reduced as\nV0 increases, which is expected, since the existence of a barrier leads to stronger reflection\nof the tails of the wave packet that are outside the channel region. A very weak oscillation\nis observed in each curve, which is due to an interference related to the path difference\nbetween electrons that go straight through the channel and those that are reflected at\n\n\n\n7.3.

Results in Figs. 7.5 (b, d, f) show a polarization\nthat increases up to 1 for higher values of L and V0, in particular for small W . For larger\nW , however, the electron starts to see a larger unbiased area in the channel, thus reduc-\ning the polarization effect. This polarization reduction for large W becomes even more\nsignificant for wave packets with higher energy. Indeed, extra energy bands with higher\nenergy appear as W increases (see Fig. 7.1(b), blue dotted curves). These bands exhibit\nstates with negative velocities, which, consequently, harness the polarization effect pro-\nposed here, which relies on bands with a single direction of the propagation velocity. The\nresults in Fig. 7.4 demonstrate that as the initial energy of the wave packet E increases,\nhigh transmission probabilities are reached for wave packets starting in both valleys (K\nand K?) and thus a suppression of the polarization effect is expected in this case, which is\ndue to the low screening of the packet by the barriers for a fixed range of bias potential.\nIt is also clear that increasing the channel length improves the valley polarization.\n\nAs already mentioned, even such almost perfect polarization for large L can be de-\nstroyed by increasing W . This is clarified in Fig. 7.6, which shows transmission proba-\nbilities (upper panels) and polarization (lower panels) as a function of the well width W\nin an anti-aligned QPC. In the case of L = 20 nm (dotted blue line), polarization stays\naround ? 100% for smaller W , but starts to decrease for W > 10 nm and 13 nm, in the\ncases of V0 = 100 meV and 200 meV, respectively.\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that an almost perfect valley filtering can be\nrealised, provided (i) the electron energy is sufficiently low, (ii) the channel length is\nsufficiently long, and (iii) the channel width is narrow enough.\n\n\n\n7.3.

CONCLUSION 173\n\n7.4 Conclusion\n\nWe calculated the transmission probabilities of a Gaussian wave packet through a\nquantum point contact defined by electrostatic gates in bilayer graphene. Our results\ndemonstrate that, if one uses the energy gaps introduced by a bias between upper and\nlower layers in order to define the channel in the point contact, transmission plateaus\nare observed as the energy of the packet increases, which reflects the discrete eigenstate\nspectrum in the channel, just like in a conventional QPC. On the other hand, if the bias\nin the left and right sides of the channel are opposite to each other, although still forming\nthe same energy gap at both sides, a special situation of energy dispersion is obtained,\nwhere electrons in each valley have only one possible direction of propagation. In this\ncase, the QPC works as an efficient valley filter, where valley polarization may reach\n? 1 with increasing gate potential. Such a valley filtering device can have an important\nimpact on future graphene valley-tronics, as it can be relatively easily achieved just by\ndepositing electrostatic gates on graphene[235], with no need either to control edge types,\nor to produce strain or non-zero mass regions, in contrast to the valley filters previously\nproposed in the literature.\n\n\n\n8\nConclusions and perspectives\n\nIn this thesis, we studied and developed computationally the Split-operator technique\nfor tight-binding and Dirac Hamiltonians in order to investigate electronic properties of\ncarbon nanostructures formed by one or two graphite layers. Further, we also investigated\nthe electronic properties of confined systems formed by monolayer, bilayer and hybrid\nmono-bilayer graphene using both continuum model and tight-binding approach.\n\nWe made a comparison between the energy levels obtained by tight-binding and Dirac\nmodels in order to identify which graphene ring structures can be described, to a good ac-\ncuracy by the continuum model. Different shapes and edge terminations were considered,\nand a graphene ring defined by a staggered potential was investigated as well. Our results\ndemonstrated that the energy levels of graphene quantum rings show a strong dependence\non the ring geometry and the edge termination. Under an applied magnetic field these\nenergy spectra presented the AB oscillations and in general rings with n-fold symmetry\nexhibited a formation of subbands with n-fold energies. Furthermore, we obtained that\ninfinitely thin Dirac rings describe quite well two ring structures: armchair hexagonal and\nrhombus-shaped rings.\n\nFurther on, we obtained a general expression for the infinite-mass boundary condition\nin bilayer graphene that can be used for any kind of circular geometry. It was derived\nusing the 4 \u00d7 4 Dirac-Weyl Hamiltoninan in the vicinity of both K and K? points. Some\nelectric properties for the bilayer graphene quantum dots defined by this new boundary\ncondition were calculated, such as the energy spectrum as a function of the dot size, of\nthe perpendicular magnetic field intensity and the cyclotron resonance. Our results for\nthe energy spectrum presented an electron(e)-hole(h) symmetry Ee(h)K (m) = ?E\n\nh(e)\nK? (m)\n\nthat is kept for both cases, under the presence or absence of magnetic field. In absence\nof magnetic field, the energy spectrum exhibits two sets of states that correspond to the\nupper and lower bilayer energy bands. The lowest states demonstrated a 1/R2 dependence,\nwhile the upper set that approaches the inter-layer hopping parameter exhibited 1/R\nbehavior. Furthermore, the energy spectrum obtained via continuum model was compared\nwith the results calculated within the tight-binding approach for a circular quantum dot\nwith actual edges and showed a good qualitative similarity.\n\n\n\n175\n\nUsing the tight-binding approach, we numerically investigated the confined states in\ntwo different hybrid monolayer-bilayer systems. In order to understand the energy spec-\ntrum for these two hybrid structures, we calculated the influence of an external perpendic-\nular magnetic field as well of different dot sizes on the spectra. Our results allowed us to\nidentify which states are dot-localized states, edge states and mixed states in the energy\nspectrum. In the presence of the magnetic field, the energy levels approached to the Lan-\ndau levels in the both zigzag and armchair edge terminations of the bilayer anti-dot and\nthey exhibited an electron-hole symmetry. Both suggested monolayer-bilayer graphene\nquantum dot were demonstrated to be reasonable systems to confine carriers in graphene\nnanostructures. The confinement occurs due to the fact that: (i) a gap was opened just in\nbilayer region for the anti-dot case when it was considered an applied bias gate, whereas\n(ii) for the case of a bilayer graphene dot surround by a hexagonal region of monolayer\ngraphene, even in the absence of a bias voltage the bilayer energies are lower than energy\nlevels of the monolayer graphene.\n\nAfterwards, we numerically studied the scattering, in the reciprocal and real spaces,\nof a Gaussian wave packet propagating close to graphene edges. Using the tight-binding\nmodel and the Split-operator technique we demonstrated the inter- and intra-valley scat-\ntering between K to K? Dirac cones for the reflections close respectively to the zigzag and\narmchair edges. Under the presence of an external magnetic field we verified the so called\nskipping orbits due to the scattering of the electron nearby the edge of the sample. On\nthe other hand, for a pseudo-magnetic field induced by non-uniform strain our numerical\nresults demonstrated that scattered wave packet behaved as a non-propagating edge state\nfor the armchair terminated strained graphene.\n\nFinally, we demonstrated that a quantum point contact defined by electrostatic gates in\nbilayer graphene can be used as a valley filtering device, being this way a very simple form\nto build valleytronic devices as compared to the already suggested structures proposed in\nthe literature. Two kinds of the gate alignments were investigated using the tight-binding\nmodel and the Split-operator techniques in order to compute the transport properties\nfor these systems. For the aligned case, plateaus in the transmission probability as a\nfunction of the initial wave packet energy were observed, suggesting a behaviour just like\nin a conventional quantum point contact. But if the bias are opposite in each side of the\ndevice, then the situation is favorable for valley filtering, because in this case the energy\ndispersion is not symmetric anymore. The chiral states are by this way responsible for\nallowing only certain direction of propagation in each valley. Our results provided the\nparameters that improve the efficiency of proposed bilayer system as a valley filter, such\nas length, width and amplitude of the applied potential. By our simulations, we observed\nthat the almost perfect efficiency can be achieved for a long length and a narrow width\nof the channel formed between the bias gates.\n\nRegarding the study of charge carriers dynamics in multi-layer graphene-related sys-\ntems using the wave packet propagation or by a wavefront and for the works concerned\n\n\n\n176\n\nwith electronic states in graphene, we propose some interesting problems to be investi-\ngated and to be developed in the near future. So, as a short-term perspective, we intend\nto address a study about the following problems:\n\n\u2022 the wave packet scattering on bilayer graphene edges in order to check how much\nof the incident wave packet is spread to each one of the valleys K and K? in the\nreciprocal space [130];\n\n\u2022 valley filtering in graphene due to substrate-induced potential: in this system, the\nmass potential is generated by a staggered potential, such that a spacial constric-\ntion for the electron in a certain region of monolayer is performed. Thus, we will\ninvestigate in which situations there will be a greater percentage of the transmission\nprobability coefficient, leading to a valley filtering effect [127];\n\n\u2022 the effect of a periodic potential induced by strain in the graphene eigenenergies: we\nwill investigate which situations present opening of a gap in the energy spectrum.\nThe pseudo-magnetic field induced by strain in our tight-binding model will not\nbe introduced by artificially introducing a vector potential to the Peierls phase\n[216, 218], but rather by changing the interatomic distances of the carbon atoms of\nthe lattice;\n\n\u2022 the scattering of a Gaussian wave packet by an interface between monolayer and\nbilayer graphene formed by a single and a double boundary with zigzag or arm-\nchair edges. In this work, we shall demonstrate the dependence of the transmission\nprobability related to the incident angle and also we shall present different features\ndepending on the edge type of interface between monolayer and bilayer graphene,\nthe K and K? Dirac cones considered and also on the alignment of the atomic bounds\nat monolayer / bilayer interface [186, 236, 237, 238, 239].\n\n\n\nAppendix A\n\nMultilayer graphene in AA stacking\n\nAn effective two-component Hamiltonian may be derived under some approximations\nfor a n-layer graphene, in a similiar way as for graphite. This 2 \u00d7 2 Hamiltonian is\ndescribed in the low energy limit, i. e. in the limit such that the energy is much smaller\nthan the hopping energy t? between the parallel layers E ? t?, where the upper bands\nof the energy spectrum of the n-layer graphene are neglected. Thus, in a two-band\napproximation, one can write the 2\u00d72 Hamiltonian for n coupled layers in rhombohedral\nstacking as [81]\n\nHn(k) =\n(~vFk)\n\nn\n\ntn?1?\n\n(\n0 e?in?k\n\ne+in?k 0\n\n)\n, (8.1)\n\nwhere k =\n?\nk2x + k\n\n2\ny and ?k = tan\n\n?1 (ky/kx). The corresponding eigenenergy and wave-\nfunction of the lowest (highest) conduction (valence) band are\n\nEk,s,n =\ns (~vFk)\n\nn\n\ntn?1?\n, ?k,s,n =\n\n1?\n2\n\n(\n1\n\n?sein?k\n\n)\n, with s = \u00b11, (8.2)\n\nwhere the sign of s refers to the conduction (+) or valence (?) bands, respectively.\nNote that for n-layer graphene E ? kn. This approximation is valid for small ener-\n\ngies and the quantitative deviation of this approximation gets more significant as the n\nincreases.\n\n\n\nAppendix B\n\nPublications related to this thesis\n\n\u2022 D.
