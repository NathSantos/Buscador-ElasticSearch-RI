Temporal dynamics of the chaetophoracean green algae Chaetophora elegans (Roth) C.A. Agardh and\nStigeoclonium amoenum K\u00fctzing populations was investigated biweekly during late autumn trhough early spring (April to\nOctober) in two tropical streams from northwestern S\u00e3o Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. Abundances of one population of\neach species was evaluated by the quadrat technique in terms of percent cover and frequency. The fluctuations were related\nto the following stream variables: temperature, turbidity, specific conductance, pH, oxygen saturation, depth, substratum type,\ncurrent velocity, irradiance and nutrients. Percent cover and frequency of C. elegans had lower values throughout the study\nperiod and was positively correlated to rainfall. Other correlations (i.e. positive of percent cover with depth and current\nvelocity and negative with irradiance) were consistently found, reinforcing the strong influence of rainfall. On the other hand,\npercent cover and frequency of S. amoenum had higher values, with maximum growth from June to September. Percent cover\nwas negatively correlated to rainfall. Results suggest the precipitation regime as the most important driving force to temporal\nchanges in both populations, but playing different roles in each one. The gelatinous thallus of C. elegans seem to be favored\nby the increment of current velocity, since higher flows can improve the nutrient uptake by means of reduction in diffusion\nshell without promoting excessive drag force. In contrast, tufts of S. amoenum are, presumably, more exposed to drag force,\nand, consequently, more susceptible to mechanical damage effects due to higher current velocities.\n\nKey words - Chaetophora, macroalgae, Stigeoclonium, stream, temporal dynamics\n\nRESUMO \u2013 (Din\u00e2mica temporal de duas esp\u00e9cies de Chaetophoraceae (Chlorophyta) em riachos tropicais do Estado de S\u00e3o\nPaulo, sudeste do Brasil). A din\u00e2mica temporal das algas verdes Chaetophora elegans (Roth) C.A. Agardh e Stigeoclonium\namoenum K\u00fctzing foi investigada bimensalmente de final do outono a in\u00edcio da primavera (abril a outubro) em dois riachos da\nregi\u00e3o noroeste do estado de S\u00e3o Paulo. A abund\u00e2ncia (cobertura percentual e freq\u00fc\u00eancia) de uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o de cada esp\u00e9cie\nfoi avaliada pela t\u00e9cnica de quadrado. A flutua\u00e7\u00e3o foi relacionada com as seguintes vari\u00e1veis ambientais: temperatura, turbidez,\ncondutividade espec\u00edfica, pH, oxig\u00eanio dissolvido, profundidade, tipo de substrato, velocidade da correnteza, irradi\u00e2ncia e\nnutrientes. Cobertura percentual e freq\u00fc\u00eancia de C. elegans foram baixas durante todo o per\u00edodo e correlacionaram-se positivamente\ncom precipita\u00e7\u00e3o pluviom\u00e9trica. Outras correla\u00e7\u00f5es (positiva de cobertura percentual com profundidade e velocidade da correnteza\ne negativa com irradi\u00e2ncia) foram consistentemente encontradas, refor\u00e7ando a forte influ\u00eancia da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o. Cobertura\npercentual e freq\u00fc\u00eancia de S. amoenum foram altas, com valores m\u00e1ximos entre junho e setembro.

Several studies have\nshowed that most of these parameters vary seasonally\na n d  a r e  r e l a t e d  t o  t h e  f l u c t u a t i o n s  i n  s t r e a m\nmacroalgal communities (e.g. Pringle 1990, Sheath\n&amp; Hambrook 1990, Everitt &amp; Burkholder 1991,\nPfister 1993, Rosemond 1994, Borchardt 1996,\nDeNicola 1996, Hill 1996).\n\n\n\nC.C.Z. Branco &amp; O. Necchi Junior: Temporal dynamics of Chaetophoraceae152\n\nThe green algal family Chaetophoraceae is a well\nrepresented taxonomic group in stream macroalgal\ncommunities worldwide, mainly by species of\nChaetophora and Stigeoclonium (Holmes &amp; Whitton\n1981, Entwisle 1989, Biggs 1990, Sheath &amp; Cole\n1992, Branco &amp; Necchi Junior 1996a, 1997, Necchi\nJunior et al. 2000). However, available information\nconcerning temporal distribution of these green algae\nis still scarce, particularly for tropical regions.\nDespite the high frequency of occurrence in stream\nhabitat communities, temporal analysis of individual\nspecies of Chaetophoraceae are virtually absent in\nliterature.\n\nSeasonal data on populations of Chaetophoraceae\nare mostly reported in broader studies focusing on the\nentire macroalgal communities. Some recent\ninvestigations are relevant in this context, including few\ncarried out in Brazilian lotic ecosystems, such as Necchi\nJunior et al. (1991), Necchi Junior &amp; Pascoaloto (1993)\nand Branco &amp; Necchi Junior (1997). Similarly, specific\nseasonal studies with members of Chaetophoraceae in\nrunning waters are few. Entwisle (1989) described the\nseasonal variation in abundance of the Cladophora-\nStigeoclonium communities in two urban creeks from\nAustralia, showing that the growth pattern of these algae\nare distinct year round. Rosemond &amp; Brawley (1996)\nfound that the species-specific characteristics explain\nthe persistence of Stigeoclonium tenue (C.A. Agardh)\nK\u00fctzing in a woodland stream from Tennessee, USA.\n\nConsidering the scarcity of information on temporal\ndynamics of Chaetophoracean species in stream\nenvironments, this study was taken aiming to describe\nthe temporal variation patterns of Chaetophora\nelegans and Stigeoclonium amoenum populations, in\ntwo streams from the northwest region of S\u00e3o Paulo\nState, southeastern Brazil.\n\nMaterial and methods\n\nThe study was carried out in two tropical streams from\nthe northwest region of S\u00e3o Paulo State, southeastern Brazil.\nThe population of Chaetophora elegans (Roth) C.A. Agardh\nwas sampled in Talhadinho Stream, a third-order stream\nsegment, with continuous rocky substratum, located in S\u00e3o\nJos\u00e9 do Rio Preto (20\u00ba43\u2019 S and 49\u00ba13\u2019 W). The population\nof Stigeoclonium amoenum K\u00fctzing was analyzed in Bor\u00e1\nStream, also a third-order stream segment with predominantly\nrocky substratum, located in the municipality of Cedral\n(20\u00ba58\u2019 S and 49\u00ba25\u2019 W). The sampling sites were visited\nbiweekly during the typical growth period of the macroalgal\ncommunities in this region (Necchi Junior &amp; Pascoaloto 1993,\nBranco &amp; Necchi Junior 1997), extending from late autumn\n\n(28 May - Talhadinho Stream and 26 April - Bor\u00e1 Stream) to\nearly spring (15 October - Talhadinho and 31 October - Bor\u00e1\nStream) in 1996. This sampling period was mandatory due\nto low abundance, or even lack of plants, during the remaining\nof the year not allowing observations and collections for the\npurposes of this study.\n\nThe sampling sites consisted of a 10 m length stream\nsegment (Sheath &amp; Burkholder 1985). The abundance of the\npopulations were estimated by means of the quadrat technique\n(Necchi Junior et al. 1995a). Sampling units were circles of\n25 cm in diameter (area = 0.05 m2); this shape was adopted\nto reduce the edge effect (Krebs 1989). The size of sampling\nunits was chosen on the basis of preliminary tests and a\nprevious investigation (Necchi Junior et al. 1995b). Twenty\nsampling units were distributed in pairs at 10 equally spaced\nintervals along the stream segment, resulting in a total\nsampling area of 1 m2 in each collecting date. Within the\nsampling units, algal percent cover on the substratum was\nestimated visually (Necchi Junior 1993, Branco &amp; Necchi\nJunior 1998) with a Plexiglas viewbox (bottom surface ca\n175 cm2). We tested the accuracy of percent cover of\nStigeoclonium amoenum against ash-free dry-weight in 15\nsampling units consisting of circles 10 cm in diameter (area\nca. 79 cm2) and they proved to be positively correlated\n(r = 0.69, p &lt;0.01). Necchi Junior &amp; Branco (1998) also\ndescribed, to the red alga Batrachospermum delicatulum\n(Skuja) Necchi &amp; Entwisle, positive correlation (r = 0.37-0.54,\np &lt; 0.01) among visual estimation and two usual destructive\ntechniques (ash-free dry-weight and chlorophyll a).\nTherefore, this parameter proved to be reliable for the purpose\nof this study. Frequency of occurrence was also calculated,\nconsidering the number of sampling units with algal thallus\nto the total units sampled.\n\nTen plants were randomly collected along the stream\nsegment for morphometric analysis on each sampling date.\nSamples were preserved in 4% formaldehyde (Branco &amp;\nNecchi Junior 1996a) for microscopic observation. The\nrandomization of sites for algal collection was based on the\nposition indicated by the collector \u2019s watch hand at\npredetermined time intervals (Necchi Junior et al. 1997).\n\nSpecimens collected within quadrats were measured for\nthe following morphometric characters: Chaetophora\nelegans, colony diameter, cell length and diameter (main axis)\nand apical branch number; Stigeoclonium amoenum, plant\nlength, cell length and diameter of the main axis and lateral\nbranches cell length and diameter. These characters were\nchosen according to a previous study (Branco &amp; Necchi\nJunior 1998). Measurements were made in replicates of 12 for\nall morphometric characters.\n\nThe following environmental variables were measured:\nwater temperature, specific conductance, turbidity, pH and\ndissolved oxygen, with Horiba U-10 water checker, equipped\nwith a multiple probe from a water sample collected in\nmidstream segments at 12:00 \u00b1 1 h. Current velocity was\nmeasured  by using a General Oceanics 2030R mechanical\n\n\n\nRevista Brasil. Bot., V.26, n.2, p.151-161, jun. 2003 153\n\nflowmeter immediately below the water surface, whereas\nirradiance was determined with a Li-Cor LI-189 quantameter\nand a Li-Cor LI-193SA spherical quantum sensor at the stream\nbottom. Nutrients (except total nitrogen and phosphorous)\nwere analyzed with a Horiba F-24 ion meter and Orion ion\nselective electrodes (ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, calcium and\npotassium) from a water sample collected at the midpoint of\nsampling sites. Total N an P were determined according to\nthe technique described by Valderrama (1981). Current\nvelocity, irradiance and depth (with a rule) were measured at\nthe center of each sampling unit. Substratum type (according\nto particle size classes given by Gordon et al. 1992) was also\nannotated. Rainfall data for the closest locality of the sampling\nsite were provided by the Regional Division of the Secretary\nof Agriculture, S\u00e3o Paulo State (figure 1). Numerical data\nwere submitted to the following statistical analyses (Sokal &amp;\nRohlf 1981): Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, one way),\nPearson\u2019s product-moment correlation coefficient and\nmultiple regression. Tests were performed by using the\nMinitab statistical package (Ryan et al. 1985).\n\nResults\n\nChaetophora elegans (Roth) C.A. Agardh -\nEnvironmental data (figures 2-3) are described only for\nthe variables that revealed some relationship with\nbiological parameters of the population studied.\nTemperature varied considerably throughout the study\nperiod (17.1-25.5 \u00baC, 20.7 \u00b1 2.7, mean \u00b1 one standard-\ndeviation), with the lowest values in early winter and\nthe highest during early spring. It was positively\ncorrelated with irradiance (r = 0.73, p &lt; 0.01). Specific\nconductance varied from 38.6 to 89.2 \u00b5S.cm-1 (68.3 \u00b1\n15.8) and revealed a similar pattern with temperature\n(r = 0.86, p &lt;0.001). Dissolved oxygen had values in\nthe range of 3.9-6.3 mg.L-1 and was negatively\ncorrelated with temperature (r = -0.73, p &lt;0.01).\nIrradiance was high throughout the period, ranging from\n1,150 to 2,435 \u00b5mol.m-2.s-1 (1,765 \u00b1 705), except for\nextremely low values on 28 June (53 \u00b5mol.m-2.s-1), due\nto rainy conditions. It was negatively correlated with\ncurrent velocity (r = -0.84, p  &lt; 0.001). Depth was low\nvarying from 5.4 to 7.7 cm (6.0 \u00b1 0.9), with lower values\nin the peak of winter. Current velocity tended to\ndecrease along the period (39-74 cm.s-1, 48 \u00b1 11), except\nfor a peak on 28 June. The potassium concentration\nshowed a relatively narrow variation, ranging from 15.5\nto 20.0 mg.L-1 (16.6 \u00b1 1.3), except for a peak on 28\nJune, with a slight increase towards the end of the period.\nThe nitrate concentration, showed a similar pattern with\npotassium, with narrow variation (9.6-10.7 \u00b5g.L-1, 10.3\n\u00b1 0.2).\n\nThe population of Chaetophora elegans varied\nsignificantly throughout the study period in terms of\npercent cover (F = 3.5, p  &lt;0.001) (figure 4), with very\nlow values, ranging from 0 to 0.9% (0.4 \u00b1 0.3). It was\npositively correlated with frequency (r = 0.85, p &lt;0.001)\nand precipitation (r = 0.58, p &lt;0.05) and negatively\ncorrelated with nitrate (r = -0.74, p &lt;0.01) and potassium\n(r = -0.58, p &lt;0.05). Multiple regression analysis\nrevealed that precipitation, depth, current velocity and\nirradiance, were conjointly responsible for 68% in\npercent cover variation of C. elegans population.\nCorrelations tests of C. elegans abundance with\nenvironmental variables performed to each sampling date\nindividually showed consistent results. Percent cover\nwas positively correlated with depth and current velocity\nin 33% and 22% of the sampling dates, respectively,\nand negatively with irradiance in 33% of samplings.\n\nFrequency showed the same seasonal pattern of\nabundance, with low values during the entire period,\nfrom 0 to 60% (29 \u00b1 22) (figure 4).

Despite the\nlow values of percent cover of C. elegans, results\nindicated a possible influence of precipitation regime,\nand its effects, on the population studied, suggesting that\nthis variable was the driving force most closely related\nwith temporal variations of species abundance. In\nsupport to this view, some correlations were consistently\nobserved throughout the sampling period (e.g., positive\nwith depth and current velocity; negative with\nirradiance), corroborating the influence of precipitation\non abundance of C. elegans population.\n\nPrecipitation regime has been often described as\nan important factor of seasonal changes of macroalgal\ncommunities in lotic ecosystems from tropical regions\nin Brazil (Necchi Junior et al. 1991, Necchi Junior &amp;\nPascoaloto 1993, Branco &amp; Necchi Junior 1997). Branco\n&amp; Necchi Junior (1997) ascribed the capacity to provoke\nchange in local environmental conditions and,\nconsequently, the algal communities to the rainfall in three\ntropical drainage systems. Variations in the precipitation\nregime could cause indirect effects, mainly related to\nthe current velocity pattern. Higher values of current\nvelocity promote two opposite major forces acting on\nalgal communities (Stevenson 1996): a) a positive force\nof stimulation related with increase in the nutrients\nuptake; b) a negative drag force tending to brush the\nplants downstream. The gelatinous thallus of\nChaetophora elegans seems to be stimulated by a\nmoderate increase in current velocity that would promote\na reduction of diffusion shell and, consequently, increase\nnutrient uptake. On the other hand, the drag force would\nbe minimized because the filaments are protected from\ndirect mechanical effects of water flow for being\nimmersed in a mucilaginous matrix.\n\nBranco &amp; Necchi Junior (1998) investigated\nmicrohabitat distribution and niche width of two\npopulations of Chaetophora elegans from S\u00e3o Paulo\nState. Narrow microhabitat conditions and smaller niche\nwidth of both populations were related to the low\nabundance in streams from S\u00e3o Paulo State.

Bot., V.26, n.2, p.151-161, jun. 2003 159\n\nsuggested as one of the most favorable microhabitat\nconditions for development of this species. Therefore,\nthe typical pattern of low abundance of C. elegans found\nin several streams from S\u00e3o Paulo State (Necchi Junior\net al. 1995a, Branco &amp; Necchi Junior 1996b, 1997, 1998),\nalso found in this study, can be associated to a combination\nof microhabitat conditions and seasonal fluctuations\ndetermined by the rainfall regime.\n\nThe peak of percent cover and frequency of\nStigeoclonium amoenum population occurred during\ndriest season (June to September) in studied area. The\npercent cover of S. amoenum was negatively correlated\nto precipitation, indicating a different influence on the\npopulation than that observed in Chaetophora elegans.\nThe increase in current velocity induces a higher\nmechanical pressure on S. amoenum plants and,\nconsequently, damage effects. This negative influence\nis specially important to this species, which has no\nspecific morphological adaptation to avoid drag force.\n\nCorrelations observed within sampling dates\nrevealed that substratum type can influence the percent\ncover of Stigeoclonium amoenum. Macrophytes and\n\nboulders had consistent positive correlations with\nabundance in several sampling dates, revealing the\nassociation to more stable substrata with the population\nestablishment and maintenance. Coherently, negative\ncorrelations were found of percent cover with an\nunstable substratum (sand-clay). Thus, the effects\npromoted by precipitation on substratum composition\naltering population\u2019s abundance are best viewed as\nmechanical interactions related to plants attachment\nthan as ecophysiological features.\n\nEntwisle (1989) described the extensive growth of\nStigeoclonium during winter and spring, covering most\nsubmerged substrata, but no development into long\nmassive tufts as in Cladophora during summer. Our\ndata indicated a similar seasonal pattern of growth, with\nthe most expressive biomass during winter, but the\npossible causes were sharply different. The most\nimportant driving factors pointed out by Entwisle (1989)\nwere nutrient concentration (such as nitrogen and\nphosphorous), substrata availability and a higher diffusion\ngradient promoted by rising water levels, and\nconsequently, faster flowing, helping Stigeoclonium to\nout compete Cladophora in early and late season growth.\n\nRosemond &amp; Brawley (1996) reported that\nStigeoclonium tenue (C.A. Agardh) K\u00fctzing had lower\nphotosynthetic capacity than other algae at high\nenvironmental irradiance and low nutrient levels,\nindicating low competitive capacity under these specific\nconditions. In addition, the authors suggested that\nStigeoclonium may also become relatively more\nsusceptible to herbivore when irradiance is increased.\nNo direct correlation was observed among abundance\nof Stigeoclonium amoenum and irradiance or nutrients\nin this study, whereas grazing effects have not been\nexamined. However, there was no evidence of\nexpressive growth of insect larvae (or other\nmacroinvertebrates) in the streams analyzed in this study\nand, thus, no major influence on Chaetophoracean\nspecies abundance is expected.\n\nA microhabitat investigation (Branco &amp; Necchi\nJunior 1998) indicated Stigeoclonium amoenum (as\nS. helveticum Vischer) as a generalist species, being\nable to support a wide range of microhabitat conditions.\nIn addition, results of this study suggest that S. amoenum\nhas also high tolerance to temporal variations.\n\nMorphometric variation in Chaetophora elegans\nand Stigeoclonium amoenum plants examined\nthroughout this study also showed differences between\nthese Chaetophoracean species. Plants of C. elegans\nexhibited weak correlations to morphometric\ncharacteristics and environmental parameters.

Therefore, plants of S. amoenum are\npresumably well adapted to the fluctuations in the\nsurrounding environment by branch reconfiguration\n(Sheath &amp; Hambrook 1988). Thus, it takes advantage\nin using more efficiently the environmental resources\nfor their ecological success in lotic ecosystems.\n\nAcknowledgements \u2013 This study was supported by a Fapesp\ngrant-in-aid (95/2758-8) to ONJ and CNPq research grants to\nCCZB (520257/01-4) and ONJ (520551/96-6).
