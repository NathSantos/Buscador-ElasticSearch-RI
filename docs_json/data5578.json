Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, julho de 2017. \nUltrafiltrac\u00e3o e electrocoagula\u00e7\u00e3o de filtrados do branqueamento de uma f\u00e1brica \nde polpa celul\u00f3sica kraft para fins de re\u00faso. Orientador: Claudio Mudadu Silva. \n \n\nDevido ao cont\u00ednuo aumento das restri\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais em f\u00e1bricas produtoras \n\nde polpa celul\u00f3sica, a ind\u00fastria tem procurado encontrar op\u00e7\u00f5es para minimizar \n\no consumo de \u00e1gua, aumentar o re\u00faso da \u00e1gua e melhorar a qualidade do \n\nefluente final. O tratamento de correntes l\u00edquidas setoriais da f\u00e1brica pode ser \n\numa alternativa t\u00e9cnica e economicamente atrativa por possu\u00edrem baixos \n\nvolumes e altas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es quando comparados ao efluente final que \n\nconsiste na mistura de todos os efluentes da f\u00e1brica. Em estudos anteriores, foi \n\ndeterminada a viabilidade de utilizar ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o para o tratamento do efluente \n\nalcalino do setor de branqueamento da f\u00e1brica. O primeiro objetivo desse estudo \n\nfoi avaliar o re\u00faso do permeado gerado e a disposi\u00e7\u00e3o do concentrado no ciclo \n\nde recupera\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica. Os resultados indicaram que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel substituir 100% \n\nda \u00e1gua quente na prensa (EPO) sem gerar incrusta\u00e7\u00f5es de carbonato de c\u00e1lcio \n\ne hidr\u00f3xido de magn\u00e9sio. De acordo com a carateriza\u00e7\u00e3o do concentrado, \n\nestima-se que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel a disposi\u00e7\u00e3o do concentrado na \u00e1rea de evaporadores \n\nsem aumentar o risco de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de incrusta\u00e7\u00f5es ou afetar o funcionamento \n\nda caldeira de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o. O segundo objetivo foi determinar a viabilidade \n\nt\u00e9cnica de tratar o efluente \u00e1cido do setor de branqueamento com membranas \n\nde ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o e avaliar mediante simula\u00e7\u00f5es por software a viabilidade de \n\nreusar o permeado, a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de incrusta\u00e7\u00f5es de sulfato de b\u00e1rio e os efeitos \n\nna esta\u00e7\u00e3o de tratamento de efluentes da f\u00e1brica. Os resultados indicaram que \n\n\u00e9 poss\u00edvel tratar o filtrado \u00e1cido com membranas de ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o, a remo\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmat\u00e9ria organica e cor foi de 65% e 82% respetivamente. A simula\u00e7\u00e3o por \n\nsoftware indicou que a de substitui\u00e7\u00e3o de 25% da \u00e1gua branca na prensa do \n\nprimeiro estagio D pelo permeado, aumenta em 10% o risco de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nincrusta\u00e7\u00f5es de sulfato de b\u00e1rio. Neste caso o efluente final da f\u00e1brica possuiria \n\numa carga de DQO 38% menor e a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de lodo biol\u00f3gico diminuiria em 40%. \n\nO terceiro objetivo foi avaliar o tratamento de eletrocoagula\u00e7\u00e3o com eletrodos de \n\nferro e alum\u00ednio, dos efluentes \u00e1cido e alcalino, determinar a viabilidade t\u00e9cnica \n\nde reusar os efluentes tratados e determinar os efeitos na esta\u00e7\u00e3o de tratamento \n\nde efluentes (ETE). Os resultados indicaram que tanto para o efluente \u00e1cido \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\ncomo para o efluente alcalino, a maior remo\u00e7\u00e3o de DQO foi obtida com o \n\ntratamento de eletrocoagula\u00e7\u00e3o com eletrodos de alum\u00ednio, 51% e 48% \n\nrespectivamente. Pelas caracter\u00edsticas finais dos efluentes tratados, conclui-se \n\nque os mesmos podem substituir a \u00e1gua quente na prensa (EPO) sem aumentar \n\no risco de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de incrusta\u00e7\u00f5es de carbonato de c\u00e1lcio. A substitui\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\n\u00e1gua quente pelo efluente tratado diminui o consumo de \u00e1gua em 7,5 m3 por \n\ntonelada de polpa seca. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\nABSTRACT \n \n\nREYES, Rafael Ignacio Quezada, D.Sc., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, July, 2017. \nUltrafiltration and electrocoagulation of bleaching filtrates from a kraft pulp mill \nfor reuse porpuses. Adviser: Claudio Mudadu Silva. \n \n\nDue to the continuous rise of environmental concern of the pulp industry, it is \n\nnecessary to find options that minimize the water consumption, and enhance \n\neffluent quality. The treatment of specific in-plant stream seems to be an \n\nattractive technical and economical approach because of the smaller amount of \n\neffluent to be treated compared with the total final effluent volume. Previous \n\nstudies have shown that it is possible to treat alkaline extraction (EPO) effluent \n\nwith ultrafiltration membranes. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the \n\nreuse of the ultrafiltration (UF) permeate and the transfer of the retentate to the \n\nchemical recovery cycle. The results showed that it was possible to replace 100% \n\nof the hot water in the (EPO)-press without generating scaling of calcium \n\ncarbonate or magnesium hydroxide. According to the characteristics of the \n\nretentate, it is assumed that it is possible to transfer the UF-retentate to the \n\nevaporator area without increasing the risk of fouling or negatively affecting the \n\noperation of the recovery boiler. The second objective was to evaluate the \n\nfeasibility of the bleaching plant acidic effluent ultrafiltration membrane treatment \n\nand study, using software simulations, the feasibility of reusing the permeate \n\ndetermining  the risk of barium sulfate scaling and the effects on the final effluent \n\ntreatment plant. The results indicated that it was possible to treat the acidic \n\neffluent with UF membranes, the removal of COD and color was 65% and 82%, \n\nrespectively. Software simulation indicated that the 25% replacement of white \n\nwater in the first D-stage press would increase by 10% the risk of barium sulfate \n\nformation. The final total effluent of the mill decreased by 38% of the COD load \n\nand the biological sludge generation decreased by 40%. The third objective was  \n\nevaluating the electrocoagulation treatment with iron and aluminum electrodes of \n\nacidic and alkaline bleaching plant effluents, to determine the technical feasibility \n\nof reusing the treated effluents and to determine the effects on the effluent \n\ntreatment plant. The results indicated that for both, acidic and alkaline effluent, \n\nthe highest COD removal was achieved with the electrocoagulation treatment \n\nwith aluminium electrodes, 51% and 48%, respectively. Due to the pH and \n\n\n\nviii \n \n\ncomposition of the treated effluents, both treated effluents could replace hot water \n\nin the (EPO) press without increasing the risk of calcium carbonate scale \n\nformation. The substitution of hot water by treated effluent reduced water \n\nconsumption by 7.5 m3 / ADt. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n1 \n \n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O GERAL \n \n\nO setor produtivo de polpa celul\u00f3sica e papel consome um alto volume de \n\n\u00e1gua e devido ao constante aumento de sua demanda est\u00e1 perto de se \n\ntransformar em um bem limitado em alguns pa\u00edses. A diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\ndisponibilidade da \u00e1gua gerou necessidade de redu\u00e7\u00e3o do seu consumo  atrav\u00e9s \n\nde pr\u00e1ticas de controle preventivo da polui\u00e7\u00e3o pela modifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos processos \n\nfabris. \n\nO elevado consumo de \u00e1gua em processos industriais representa um \n\ngrande problema para a ind\u00fastria de polpa celul\u00f3sica e papel, principalmente \n\npelo elevado custo do tratamento dos efluentes gerados e tamanho dos \n\nequipamentos a serem utilizados (THOMPSON et al., 2001). Existem duas \n\nmaneiras de resolver este problema: o tratamento geral destes efluentes, \n\nchamado de \u201ctratamento de fim de tubo\u201d ou, reduzir ou eliminar a gera\u00e7\u00e3o na \n\nfonte, pelo procedimento de minimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do consumo de \u00e1gua atrav\u00e9s do re\u00faso \n\nde correntes internas. \n\nEm circuitos fechados, onde \u00e9 realizado intenso re\u00faso da agua, diversos \n\nelementos qu\u00edmicos, denominados de elementos n\u00e3o-process\u00e1veis (ENP), s\u00e3o \n\nacumulados at\u00e9 atingir n\u00edveis de satura\u00e7\u00e3o no meio, podendo originar s\u00e9rios \n\nproblemas no processo e prejudicar a qualidade do produto final. As \n\nconsequ\u00eancias mais comuns s\u00e3o a perda da qualidade da polpa branqueada, \n\ndevido \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de dep\u00f3sitos e entupimento de equipamentos e tubula\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\ncom a consequente perda de efici\u00eancia do processo produtivo (SAIF et al., 2013; \n\nHUBER et al., 2014). \n\nTend\u00eancias no tratamento de efluentes industriais, indicam que \u00e9 mais \n\nadequado e conveniente, a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de medidas de tratamento em \n\ncorrentes l\u00edquidas internas da f\u00e1brica antes que elas sejam reutilizadas. As \n\nprincipais vantagens desta estrat\u00e9gia \u00e9 a redu\u00e7\u00e3o do volume do efluente a ser \n\ntratado e o menor tamanho dos equipamentos a serem utilizados, por \n\nconseguinte, menores custos de tratamento (BERUBE &amp; HALL, 2000; KOSSAR, \n\n2013; QUEZADA et al., 2014). \n\nO branqueamento da polpa celul\u00f3sica \u00e9 a etapa, dentro do processo de \n\nfabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de polpa Kraft, que gera o maior volume de efluentes. Uma sequ\u00eancia \n\nde branqueamento de polpa Kraft de eucalipto comumente utilizada tem sido \n\nD(EPO)DD, ou seja, um est\u00e1gio com di\u00f3xido de cloro (D) seguido por extra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nalcalina refor\u00e7ada com per\u00f3xido de hidrog\u00eanio e oxig\u00eanio (EPO), seguido por \n\noutros dois est\u00e1gios com di\u00f3xido de cloro. \n\nExistem v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas testadas para tratar o efluente gerado no \n\nbranqueamento da polpa kraft (SEMPERE et al., 2002; MOUNTEER et al., 2007; \n\nQUEZADA et al., 2014). Nos \u00faltimos anos as tecnologias eletroqu\u00edmicas, tais \n\ncomo eletrocoagula\u00e7\u00e3o, eletroflota\u00e7\u00e3o e eletrooxida\u00e7\u00e3o, tem sido utilizadas para \n\no tratamento de efluentes (CHEN, 2004; VALENTE et al., 2012; PULKKA et al., \n\n2014). Entre esses m\u00e9todos, se destaca a eletrocoagula\u00e7\u00e3o como uma t\u00e9cnica \n\npromissora devido \u00e0s suas caracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas: elevada degrada\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npoluentes, menor gera\u00e7\u00e3o de lodo e facilidade na opera\u00e7\u00e3o (ZAIED &amp; \n\nBELLAKHAL, 2009; SRIDHAR et al., 2011). \n\nPor outro lado, h\u00e1 alguns anos, tem-se empregado a tecnologia de \n\nfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o com membranas para o tratamento da \u00e1gua e/ou aguas residuais. \n\nAtualmente, essa tecnologia \u00e9 aplicada e se mostra vi\u00e1vel para o tratamento de \n\ndiferentes tipos de efluentes. A filtra\u00e7\u00e3o por membranas pode ser classificada \n\ndependendo do di\u00e2metro m\u00e9dio dos poros como: microfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o (MF) ( 10 \u2013 100 \n\n\u00b5m), ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o (UF) (2 - 100 nm), nanofiltra\u00e7\u00e3o (NF) (500 - 2.000 g/mol) e \n\nosmose inversa (OI) (&lt;500 g/mol) (M\u00c4NTT\u00c4RI et al.,; KASHER, 2009; MURO, \n\n2012; QUEZADA et al., 2014). \n\nExistem programas de simula\u00e7\u00e3o de processos industriais que realizam \n\nbalan\u00e7os de massa bastante pr\u00f3ximos dos processos industriais. Dentre esses \n\nprogramas, destaca-se o WinGEMS, largamente utilizado para simula\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nunidades do processo de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de polpa celul\u00f3sica e papel (DION\u00cdSIO et al., \n\n2010). O software WinGEMS n\u00e3o tem capacidade de realizar c\u00e1lculos de \n\nforma\u00e7\u00e3o de incrusta\u00e7\u00f5es, dado importante para definir estrat\u00e9gias de re\u00faso de \n\nefluentes. Para determinar o potencial de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de incrusta\u00e7\u00f5es diversos \n\npesquisadores incorporam os modelos cin\u00e9ticos de forma\u00e7\u00e3o de sais ao software \n\n(LITVAY et al., 2003; WADSBORN, 2011; WADSBORN &amp; R\u00c5DESTR\u00d6M, 2011). \n\nO objetivo geral deste estudo foi avaliar o uso de membranas de ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda eletrocoagula\u00e7\u00e3o no tratamento de efluentes gerados no branqueamento da \n\npolpa celul\u00f3sica Kraft. \n\nO primeiro cap\u00edtulo trata do re\u00faso do permeado do tratamento de ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo efluente alcalino do setor de branqueamento e o envio do concentrado no \n\nciclo de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica. \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nO segundo cap\u00edtulo trata do tratamento do filtrado \u00e1cido com membranas de \n\nultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o, o re\u00faso do permeado dentro do setor de branqueamento e os \n\nefeitos na esta\u00e7\u00e3o de tratamento de efluentes (ETE). \n\nO terceiro cap\u00edtulo aborda o tratamento de electrocoagula\u00e7\u00e3o com eletrodos \n\nde ferro e alum\u00ednio dos efluentes \u00e1cido e alcalino, o re\u00faso do efluente tratado e \n\nos efeitos na ETE. \n\n \n\n \n\nREFERENCIAS \n \n\nCHEN, G.

According to the WinGEMS steady-state software simulation, 100% \n\nreplacement of hot water with permeate was possible without critical \n\naccumulation of non-process elements (NPE) or CaCO3 and Mg(OH)2 scaling \n\nformation during the softwood and hardwood campaigns. The feasibility of \n\nmembrane retentate reuse in the black-liquor recovery cycle (prior to evaporation) \n\nwas also evaluated. The results showed a negligible increase in the load of critical \n\nelements in the weak black liquor. Therefore, no scaling formation or negative \n\neffect on the performance of the recovery boiler is expected. \n\n \n\nKeywords: (EPO) effluent, membrane treatment, pulp mill effluent, simulation, \n\nultrafiltration, water reuse. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \n\nThe pulp and paper industry is the largest consumer of water among the \n\nindustrial activities of the countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation \n\nand Development (OECD). Since 1980, water pollution from the pulp and paper \n\nsector has been significantly reduced in most OECD paper-producing countries. \n\nPulp mills all over the world have been required to develop ways to minimize \n\nwater consumption and effluent discharges.  The reuse of in-plant liquid streams \n\nis a logical alternative to be considered (DION\u00cdSIO et al., 2010) and the bleach \n\nplant is the major source of liquid effluent in modern mills (DENCE &amp; REEVE, \n\n1996). Bleach plant filtrate requiring external treatment is in the range of 15-30 \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nm3/ADt (air dried tone of pulp). It is rich in organic matter and has a high color \n\ncontent and normally consists of two separate streams: an acidic stream and an \n\nalkaline stream. The alkaline filtrate has a high content of dissolved organic \n\nsubstances, measured by the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and color, and \n\nthis contributes significantly to the effluent quality of the entire mill (POKHREL; \n\nVIRARAGHAVAN, 2004). \n\nMembrane filtration technology has been used in several industries, e.g., \n\nfood, pharmaceutical, and water treatment (ROSENBERG et al., 2009; CHHAYA \n\net al., 2013) and its use is increasing because new materials, better \n\nconfigurations, and cost reductions are rapidly developing. For example, until \n\nrecently there was no polymeric membrane separation system that could resist \n\nhigh pH and temperature KASHER, 2009). While membrane technology remains \n\nrarely used in Kraft pulp mills, there is an increased interest from the pulp industry \n\nto find technically and economically attractive options to reduce water \n\nconsumption and minimize effluent generation. One notable example is a \n\nmembrane filtration plant that has been in operation since 1995 to clean bleach \n\nplant effluent at a Swedish sulfite pulp mill (NORDIN &amp; J\u00d6NSSON, 2006). In that \n\ncase, a suitable membrane type and configuration were selected for membrane \n\ntreatment of alkaline (EPO) filtrates (pH 11 and temperature 70 \u00b0C) from a \n\nsoftwood and hardwood kraft pulp mill.  Technically and economically optimal \n\noperation conditions for the system (transmembrane pressure, cross flow \n\nvelocity, volume concentration factor and cleaning regime) to remove organic \n\ncontaminants were selected. The results of this study showed that an \n\nultrafiltration (UF) membrane with the pore size of 4000 g/mol achieved a COD \n\nand color removal of 65% and 93%, respectively (QUEZADA et al., 2014). \n\nDuring membrane filtration, two streams are generated: a permeate \n\nstream and a retentate. To develop a water conservation program in a mill, the \n\nchallenge is to reuse these streams without compromising the mill processes and \n\nthe product quality. The accumulation of elements and compounds (non-process \n\nelements) in the water cycle can cause severe problems in the mill (ULMGREN, \n\n1997; DOLD\u00c1N et al., 2011), the most common in the bleach plant being \n\nassociated with formation of barium sulfate, calcium carbonate and calcium \n\noxalate. The amount of filtrate that can be reused depends on specific mill \n\nprocesses and configurations. \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nTo predict the accumulation of non-process elements and the relative \n\nsolubility of some compounds, it is possible to simulate these phenomena using \n\ncomputer simulation software (ULMGREN, 2001). The objectives of this study \n\nwere to use pilot scale filtration and software simulation to evaluate the feasibility \n\nof recycling the UF permeate in the bleach plant and the reuse of the UF retentate \n\nin the black-liquor evaporation plant. \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nUF Membrane treatment \nA filtrate from the wash press after the oxygen- and peroxide-reinforced \n\nextraction stage (EPO) was obtained from a kraft pulp mill, where the wood type \n\nchanged every 6 months from hardwood to softwood. In both campaigns, the \n\nbleaching sequence was D(EPO)DD. \n\nA pilot membrane treatment of 19 L/min of (EPO) filtrate was performed \n\nduring two months for each campaign (Figure 1). A continuous-feed two-stage \n\nmembrane pilot plant was used. Each stage had three parallel tubular membrane \n\nmodules, each of which was 3.6 m long and 1.3 cm in diameter, with a molecular \n\nweight cut-off of 4000 g/mol, and contained 18 perforated stainless-steel tubes in \n\nthe form of a shell and a tube. Each tube was fitted with a membrane element. \n\nThe operation conditions were a cross-flow velocity (CFV) of 3 m/s and a \n\ntransmembrane pressure (TMP) of 7 bar, which provided a concentration volume \n\nfactor (CVF) of 98. The membrane permeates and retentates obtained in both \n\ncampaigns were collected, stored at 4\u00b0C, and characterized according to the \n\nStandard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, 2005). \n\nThe parameters measured in the permeate and retentate were COD, pH, color, \n\nsodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, barium, aluminum, \n\nsulfate, phosphorus and chloride. There were 15 repetitions of COD, pH, and \n\ncolor and 2 repetitions of the other parameters. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\n \nFigure 1 - Flowchart of the bleaching area with membrane treatment \n\nMembrane permeate reuse \nA full mill model was developed in WinGEMS software, which specially \n\nfocused on pulp and paper production. A steady-state model was created for the \n\nfull pulp mill, including balances for water, energy, sodium/sulfur and non-process \n\nelements (NPE). Precipitation and accumulation models regarding handling of \n\nNPE\u2019s and scaling was integrated into the software (ULMGREN, 1997, 2001). \n\nThe model takes into account temperature, ionic strength, pH, concentrations, \n\nover-saturation etc. to predict the solubility for each compound and the extent to \n\nwhich precipitations may occur. \n\nUsing the simulation model, the hot fresh water added to the (EOP) press \n\nwas stepwise replaced with permeate from the membrane filtration unit until \n\n100% of the washing liquor on the press was the UF permeate. The simulations \n\nwere run in each case to the steady-state condition after various recycle rates of \n\nthe permeate, and the risk of the effects in the pulp mill was evaluated.  \n\nMembrane retentate recycling \nThe small concentrated stream obtained from the UF treatment of the \n\n(EPO) filtrate was rich in organic matter with high molecular weight compounds. \n\nOne possible alternative to reuse this stream was to send it to the black liquor \n\ncycle.  \n\nClO2\n\nNaOH\n\nD\n\nD\n(EPO)\n\nD\n\nPre\u2013O2 \nPulp\n\nAcid effluent\n\nPermeate\n\nRetentate\n\nEffluent \ntreatment \n\nplantChemical \nrecovery \nprocess\n\nAlkaline effluent\n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nThe effect of reusing the UF retentate fraction on the black-liquor \n\nevaporation plant was evaluated by comparing the concentration of specific \n\nelements in the weak black liquor (WBL) with the mixture of UF retentate (WBL) \n\nfor each campaign. The elements and compounds that were assessed according \n\nto the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, \n\n2005) in the retentate and the weak black liquor were: sodium, calcium, \n\npotassium, magnesium, manganese, barium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, \n\nchloride and sulfate. Two repetitions were performed for each parameter. \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nUF Membrane treatment \nThe separation with ultrafiltration membrane achieved a 79% removal of \n\nthe COD and 86% removal of the color. The results indicate that the permeate \n\nflow and the removal of COD and color did not change significantly by changing \n\nthe raw material for the production of bleached pulp. The characterization of the \n\n(EPO) filtrate, UF permeate and UF retentate from the pilot filtration is shown in \n\nTable 1.  \n \n\nTable 1 - Characterization of the (EPO) filtrate, UF permeate and UF retentate  \n\nParameter \nHardwood campaign Softwood campaign \n\nHot \nwater \n\n(EPO) \nfiltrate \n\nPermeate Retentate \n(EPO) \nfiltrate \n\nPermeate Retentate \n\nFlow [L/s] 200 198 2 200 198 2  \nSodium [mg/L] 707 694 1630 679 666 1428 1.5 \nCalcium [mg/L] 8.5 1.36 51.0 2.6 0.95 59.9 1.6 \nPotassium [mg/L] 51.3 50.6 41.0 13.1 12.7 39.2 0.02 \nMagnesium [mg/L] 2.2 0.07 132 0.6 0.09 47.0 1.3 \nManganese [mg/L] 0.10 n.d* 7.0 0.15 n.d* 21.7 0.02 \nBarium [mg/L] 0.07 0.005 0.12 0.02 0.01 0.39 0 \nAluminum [mg/L] 0.20 0.14 32.0 0.26 0.2 30.5 0.05 \nSulfate [mg/L] 250.0 163.7 248 n.d* 163.7 492 30 \nCOD [mg/L] 1890 \u00b1 150 380 n.d* 1600 \u00b1 200 320 n.d* 0 \npH 10 10 n.d* 10 10 n.d* n.d* \nColor [CU] 850 \u00b1 120 120 n.d* 640 \u00b1 110 90 n.d* 0 \nTemperature [\u00b0C] 70 n.d* n.d* 70 n.d* n.d* n.d* \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nMembrane permeate reuse \nThe calcium carbonate formation in the (EPO) filtrate can be a critical \n\nparameter causing operational problems in the bleach plant because of scaling, \n\nparticularly on the pulp washers. In the softwood campaign, the calcium \n\nconcentration was lower in the UF permeate (0.95 mg/L) than in the hot water \n\n(1.60 mg/L) and therefore it decreased when the UF permeate reuse increased. \n\nHowever, a much higher concentration of carbonate ions in the permeate (350 \n\nmg/L) compared to hot water (where it could not be detected) increased the \n\nformation of calcium carbonate in the (EPO) stage pulp and in the (EPO) filtrate \n\n(Figure 2).  \n\nIn the (EPO) stage, the calcium carbonate formation increased with the \n\naddition of carbonate ions as calcium carbonate was precipitated and was \n\ntrapped by the fibers.  \n\nFigure 2 shows that calcium carbonate formed in the (EPO) filtrate when \n\nUF permeate replacement of hot water reached 50%. However, the amount of \n\ncalcium carbonate formed, even at 100% replacement of hot water was still below \n\nthe supersaturation point (the concentration of calcium and carbonate necessary \n\nto start precipitation (WOJTOWICZ, 1998; DUGGIRALA, 2005). Even if extra \n\npermeate were to be added, to the extent that the supersaturation concentration \n\nwas exceeded, the calcium carbonate retains calcium and carbonate ions in the \n\nsolution, i.e., an initially even higher concentration than equilibrium is required to \n\nbegin the precipitation of calcium carbonate. However, when the precipitation \n\nbegins, all precipitates immediately form at that point (WOJTOWICZ, 1998). \n\nThe reuse of UF permeate increases the risk of precipitation compared to \n\nthe base case, but according to these simulations, the risk is small. \n\nThe hardwood campaign had higher calcium carbonate levels in the fiber \n\nline than the softwood campaign, but no formation of calcium carbonate in the \n\n(EPO) filtrate was observed in the simulations. (Figure 3). According to analysis, \n\nthere would be a slightly different split of calcium carbonate in the wash press \n\nwith less calcium carbonate to filtrate and more calcium carbonate to the following \n\nbleaching stage. Note that the solubility data differ between hardwood and \n\nsoftwood. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \nFigure 2 - Calcium carbonate formation in the (EPO) stage and filtrate during \n\nthe softwood campaign with hot-water replacement. \n \n\n \nFigure 3 - Calcium carbonate formation in the (EPO) stage and filtrate during \n\nthe hardwood campaign with hot-water replacement. \n \n\nThe magnesium hydroxide formation decreased in both campaigns in the \n\n(EPO) stage when the UF permeate use was increased because there was less \n\nmagnesium in the UF permeate than in the hot water (Table 1). In the softwood \n\ncampaign, the magnesium hydroxide formation was 185 g/ADt without using UF \n\npermeate and 160 g/ADt with 100% of UF permeate use. In the hardwood \n\ncampaign, these values were 61 g/ADt and 50 g/ADt, respectively. \n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nC\naC\n\nO\n3(\n\ns)\n g\n\n/A\ndt\n\nHot water on EOP-press replaced with permeate (%)\n\n(EPO) Stage\n\n(EPO) Filtrate\n\nSupersaturation limit\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nC\naC\n\nO\n3(\n\ns)\n g\n\n/A\ndt\n\nHot water on EOP-press replaced with permeate (%)\n\n(EPO) Stage\n\n(EPO) Filtrate\n\nSupersaturation limit\n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nThe recycling of 100% UF permeate reduced the water consumption of the \n\nbleaching area by 5.4 m3/ADt and 5.8 m3/ADt in the hardwood and softwood \n\ncampaigns, respectively.  \n\nMembrane retentate recycling \nAccording to the flow and elemental composition of the membrane \n\nretentate, the addition of this stream into the weak black liquor prior to \n\nevaporation would result in a negligible increase in the concentration of the \n\nassessed elements in the weak black liquor (Table 2). During the hardwood \n\ncampaign, the aluminum and manganese concentrations had the largest \n\nincrease in the weak black liquor (1.72% and 1.96%, respectively). In the \n\nsoftwood campaign, aluminum and magnesium had the largest increase in \n\nconcentration (2.63% and 2.59%, respectively). \n\nWinGEMS simulation was performed for the softwood campaign. In the \n\nsimulations, the retentate was added to the weak black liquor. This was done to \n\nfully study the build-up of non-process elements. The steady state results showed \n\nthat the chloride levels in the black and white liquor would increase by 5%, \n\nassuming that the ESP-dust extraction rate is held constant. The need for make-\n\nup chemicals would decrease slightly due to the addition of sodium and sulfate. \n\nIf a slightly higher ESP-dust extraction rate was to be applied to limit the increase \n\nin chloride levels, a slightly higher consumption of make-up chemicals should be \n\nexpected. \n\nBlack liquor is composed of the organic material dissolved from the wood \n\nin the digester and from the oxygen delignification plant and also of cooking and \n\noxygen-bleaching chemicals. In the recirculation of bleach plant effluent, the \n\ndissolved material from bleaching and chemicals used in bleaching are also found \n\nin the black liquor. In addition, non-process elements that circulate in the chemical \n\nrecovery cycle are also found (CARDOSO et al., 2009). \n\nScaling on heat transfer surfaces occurs at high dry-solid concentration. \n\nThe scaling tendency of the black liquor depends on the calcium content and the \n\namount of inert components, such as sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate \n\n(CHEN &amp; GAO, 2004). Calcium carbonate scaling in the evaporators is the most \n\nfrequently identified inorganic-deposit in the kraft cycle. This phenomenon occurs \n\nin the presence of optimal substrate (non-uniform surface), optimal conditions \n\n(temperature shocks and alkaline pH) and increases in the concentrations of \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\ndissolved cations and anions, such as calcium and carbonate (MACADAM &amp; \n\nPARSONS, 2004). With the levels of chemicals in the membrane retentate and \n\nthe black liquor, the simulation shows that the calcium concentration in the weak \n\nblack-liquor stream should increase by 0.66% and 1.13% in softwood and \n\nhardwood campaigns, respectively. It is expected that this increase of the calcium \n\nconcentration will not induce calcium carbonate scaling. \n \n\nTable 2.

There is a critical relationship governing the chemistry of sulfur and \n\nsodium in the recovery boiler and it varies significantly among different processes \n\nand even in the same process depending on the operation strategy of the boiler \n\n(EMPIE, 2009). \n\nComparing the sodium and sulfate contents of the membrane retentate \n\nand the black liquor, sodium increased by 0.04% and 0.03%, whereas sulfur in \n\nthe form of sulfate increased by 0.05% and 0.04% for softwood and hardwood, \n\nrespectively. It is therefore expected that the ratio of sulfur/sodium will remain \n\nessentially unchanged after the retentate addition to the black liquor stream, and \n\nhence the recovery boiler chemical performance will not be affected. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n \n\nThe membrane treatment obtained a COD removal of 79% and 86% of \n\ncolor. \n\nIn both hardwood and softwood cases, simulation predicts that 100% \n\nreplacement of hot water in the (EPO) press should be technically possible \n\n(saving 5.4 m3/ADt and 5.8 m3/ADt, respectively). All precipitation levels slightly \n\ndecreased because of the lower NPE content in the permeate, and the \n\nsupersaturation calculations indicate that the precipitation of calcium carbonate \n\nwill not start even with 100% of the hot water being replaced by UF permeate. \n\nAccording to the characterization of the (EPO) retentate, it should be \n\nfeasible to recycle the retentate to the evaporation area without scaling formation \n\nor affecting the performance of the recovery boiler. \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n\nWe would like to thank the Universdade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde Amparo \u00e1 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) for the financial \n\nsupport and the Estudantes-Conv\u00eanio de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o program \u2013 PEC-PG, of \n\nCAPES/CNPq - Brazil \n\nREFERENCES \n \n\nCARDOSO, M.; DE OLIVEIRA, \u00c9.

A \n\npilot plant using ultrafiltration (UF) membranes with an average pore size of 4.000 \n\ng/mol was used to determine the feasibility of the treatment. The reuse of the \n\npermeate and the effects on the effluent treatment plant (ETP) were evaluated \n\nusing the simulation softwares, WinGEMSTM and BioWinTM. The acidic effluent \n\nultrafiltration achieved a COD and color removal of 65% and 82%, respectively. \n\nIf the permeate is reused within the bleaching process, it is expected to increase \n\nthe risk of scaling of barium sulfate in the first chlorine dioxide stage in 10% when \n\n25% of the drier whitewater is replaced with permeate. In this scenario, software \n\nsimulation results indicated a decrease in the COD of the final effluent and in the \n\nbiological sludge generation in 42% and 37%, respectively. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Ultrafiltration, acidic effluent, bleaching, simulation process, water \n\nreuse. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \n\nDue to the continuous increase in the environmental restrictions and public \n\nawareness, the pulp and paper industry is looking for options to reduce water \n\nconsumption (BAJPAI, 2012). In a kraft pulp process, the removal of the residual \n\nlignin from the pulp suspension by means of chemical reactions is carried out in \n\na bleaching plant. The bleaching process consists of several stages, in which the \n\npulp is chemically treated and then washed to remove spent bleaching chemicals \n\nand dissolved pulp components (HUBER et al., 2014). After the first ClO2 stage \n\n(D), an extraction stage is employed to dissolve soluble in alkali. In a modern \n\nbleaching sequence, the extraction stage is reinforced with oxygen and hydrogen \n\nperoxide (EPO), increasing the lignin removal and brightness (BRIAN N. &amp; \n\nBROGDON, 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nIn general, each bleaching stage is composed of a mixer reactor followed \n\nby a pulp washer. The bleaching plant filtrates from the washers constitute the \n\nmajor source of effluent that is sent to the effluent treatment plant (ETP). \n\nThe chemical composition of the bleaching filtrates depends greatly on the \n\nincoming wood raw material, the bleaching sequence and the precise condition \n\nunder which the bleaching stages are performed.  \n\nA difference in the molecular weight distribution has been detected \n\nbetween the alkaline and acid effluent from an ECF (elemental chlorine free) plant \n\n(VAN TRAN, 2006). The alkaline filtrate contains a significantly higher proportion \n\nof high molecular weight substances (65-75%) than the acidic filtrate (20%). The \n\nlignin  in the acidic filtrate has a much lower molecular weight than that in the \n\nalkaline effluent (DENCE &amp; REEVE, 1996). \n\nThe treatment of specific in-plant streams seems to be an attractive \n\ntechnical and economical approach because it allows the use of advanced \n\ntechnologies such as membrane filtration (KASHER, 2009). \n\nSeveral studies have reported the use of a membrane filtration to treat \n\nalkaline bleaching plant effluent (NORDIN &amp; J\u00d6NSSON, 2006; QUEZADA et al., \n\n2014) ADICIONAR MAIS, but only few studies have evaluated the feasibility of \n\nthe membrane treatment of the acidic effluent.  \n\nThe characteristics of the effluent to be treated directly affect the selection \n\nof membrane. The factors that most affect polymeric membrane structure are the \n\ntemperature and pH (NILSSON et al., 2008). Extremes pH can produce a \n\ndissociation of the functional groups of the membrane and may cause the pores \n\nto swell (LUO &amp; WAN, 2013). The develop of new polymeric membrane material \n\nwith better resistance to extreme conditions and with higher fluxes is useful for \n\nindustrial applications (SHARMA, 2005) \n\nBy increasing water circuit closure of the bleach plant, some dissolved \n\nspecies can accumulate in process loops, which may lead to scale deposits. The \n\nmost frequent types of scale in bleaching lines are composed of calcium \n\ncarbonate (in the alkaline stages), calcium oxalate and barium sulfate (in the \n\nacidic stages). Barium sulfate (Barite) deposits form in supersaturated solutions \n\ncontaining both barium and sulfate. The main barium source is the wood (higher \n\nin the bark than  in the stem) and the main sulfate source is the sulfuric acid used \n\nfor pH regulation (HUBER et al., 2014). Barite (BaSO4) is a very insoluble mineral \n\nand it is less soluble at cold temperatures, so that it is important to avoid \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\ntemperature drops anywhere in the bleaching line, especially on the washers. \n\nThe precipitation tendency of barite is pH-dependent; this is because the \n\navailability of sulfate anions is governed by the second dissociation of sulfuric \n\nacid. Barite does not require high supersaturation to start precipitating. Therefore, \n\nthere is a risk of precipitation as soon as Saturation Index is higher than zero (SI \n\n> 0). Although there is a limited amount of barium in wood (corresponding to a \n\nfew mM concentration in the conditions of the bleaching line), any increase in the \n\nbarium source may enhance barite deposits (RUDIE &amp; HART, 2006).  \n\nProcess simulation have proved to be very useful in designing and \n\noptimizing pulp and paper production processes. Various applications have been \n\ndeveloped using some simulation packages: ASPEN Plus (OLSSON, 2009), \n\nCADSIM (DION\u00cdSIO et al., 2010), WinGEMS (CULBERTSON et al., 2016), and \n\nothers.  \n\nWinGEMS (Metso Automation) is a process simulator developed for \n\napplication in the pulp and paper industry. Steady-state and dynamic behavior \n\ncan be modelled using this simulator, it is useful when calculating long-term \n\ntrends, debottlenecking and performing economic analysis. Dynamic modelling \n\ncan be used for storage analysis, developing control strategies or tracking \n\ncomponent flow through the system and investigating build up times. The \n\nsoftware uses a sequential modular approach in an interactive way for calculation \n\nof mass and energy balances. It has advantages for being relatively easy to learn \n\nand user-friendly. However, the basic version is rather limited, especially when it \n\ncomes to more detailed process chemistry. The software, however, has the \n\nadvantage of allowing the user to expand the capabilities by implementation of \n\nnew calculation routines. WinGEMS only resolve mass and heat balances, but \n\ndo not account for chemical equilibria. On the other hand, chemical speciation \n\nmethods can help to determine local scaling risk in a given process, but do not \n\nhelp to predict the consequences of a process modification as such. To solve this \n\nproblem, it is possible to create a bridge between process simulation and \n\nchemical speciation engines in order to take into account electrolyte chemistry \n\nproblems. \n\nThe objectives of the present work were to evaluate i) the feasibility of the \n\nultrafiltration membrane treatment of the bleach plant acidic effluent from a kraft \n\npulp mill, ii) software simulation tool to simulate the feasibility to recycle the clean \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nfiltrate and determine the risk of barium sulfate precipitation, and iii) evaluate the \n\neffects on the effluent treatment plant with software simulation. \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nEffluent \nThe acidic bleach plant effluent (Table 1) was obtained from a softwood \n\nkraft pulp mill with a bleaching sequence D0(EPO)D1D2. Three samples were \n\nobtained from the washpress after the first D-stage during normal operation. The \n\nCOD, color and metals were determined according to Standard Methods for the \n\nExamination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, 2005). \n\nIn the mill, after each chlorine dioxide bleaching stage (D) the pulp was \n\nwashed, the D0 stage pulp was washed with filtrate from the D1 press and the D1 \n\npulp was washed with the D2 filtrate. The D2 pulp was washed with whitewater \n\nfrom the drainage of the pulp drying process. A characterization of the whitewater \n\nis also presented in Table 1. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Bleach plant acidic effluent characterization \n\nParameter (mg/L) Acidic effluent Whitewater \n\nCOD 1650 ? 31 n.d* \nColor 755.4 ? 16 n.d* \nNa 170.16 ? 13 162 ? 7 \nCa 14.12 ? 1.3 3.22 ? 0.5 \nK 15.32 ? 1.8 0.6 ? 0.1 \n\nMg 1.68 ? 0.12 0.5 ? 0.1 \nMn 0.31 ? 0.03 0.03 ? 0.01 \nBa 0.06 ? 0.01 0.01 ? 0. 01 \nAl 0.49 ? 0.03 0.22 ? 0.05 \nCu 0.03 ? 0.01 n.d* \nSi 0.54 ? 0.01 4.3 ? 0.2 \nP 1.16 ? 0.03 n.d* \nFe 0.36 ? 0.01 n.d* \n\nSO4 910 ? 50 605 ? 11 \n        *n.d: not determined \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nUF membrane treatment \nThe membrane treatment was carried out using a batch feed one-stage \n\npilot plant (Figure 1). The pilot plant was equipped with 4 PCI B1 series flow \n\nmodule (tubular), with a single flow through the membrane (Figure 2). The \n\nmembrane was 1.2 m long and 1.3 cm in diameter, the total membrane area per \n\nmodule was 1.3 x 10-5 m2.  \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Ultrafiltration Pilot Plant \n\n \n\nThe feed pump has operated at a pressure of 6 bar. The pilot plant was \n\nfed with the acidic effluent previously collected, characterized and stored at 5?C. \nThe tubular membrane type used in this study (ESP04) was  manufactured \n\nby PCI, made by modified polyether sulfone with a molecular weight cut-off \n\n(MWCO) of 4.000 g/mol. Three tests were carried out with 10 L of effluent each, \n\nuntil the maximum volumetric concentration factor (VCF) was achieved. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2 - Batch feed pilot plant scheme \n\nFeed \nTank Pump\n\nPermeate\n\nRetentate\n\nRetentate\n\n#4#3#1 #2\n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nMembrane permeate reuse \nThe feasibility of the reuse of the UF-permeate in the bleaching area was \n\nstudied by process simulation, in order to determine the risk of scaling formation \n\nof barium sulfate (barite).  \n\nThe strategy of create a bridge between process simulation and chemical \n\nspeciation engines in order to take into account electrolyte chemistry problems \n\nwas adopted in this study: the basic WinGEMS version was expanded with the \n\nPitzer electrolytic solutions model for calculation of chemical equilibrium. The \n\nPitzer model takes as input the composition a given solution (in terms of molality, \n\nor moles of component per kg of solvent), as well as several thermodynamic \n\nparameters. As out-put, it calculates the activity coefficient of each component in \n\nsolution. These activity coefficients are necessary for solubility calculations, as \n\nthey are related to the solubility products Ksp of the precipitating electrolytes. \n\nThe new WinGEMS block was developed through the Block Development \n\nKit (BDK) application-programming interface (API), specifically designed to allow \n\nusers to create their own specialized blocks. BDK consists of a collection of static \n\nlibraries, header and source C++ files that, when compiled into a dynamic-link \n\nlibrary (DLL), provides the subroutines to be called by the custom block. \n\nUsing the simulation model, the whitewater added to the D2 press was \n\nreplaced with UF permeate. The simulations were run, in each case, to the \n\nsteady-state condition at permeate reuse rates of 0%, 25%, 50% and 100%. \n\nEffects on the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) \nThe effects of the ultrafiltration of the acidic effluent on the effluent \n\ntreatment plant was evaluated by process simulation in BioWin (EnviroSim) \n\nsoftware. The final treated effluent characteristics and sludge production were \n\ndetermined. \n\nThe mill\u2019s effluent biological treatment plant consists of an activated sludge \n\nplant (Table 2).  Each line is constituted by 4 biological selector reactors in series \n\nwith 2.1, 1.7, 0.9 and 0.9 h of retention time) followed by one bioreactor (8.9 h of \n\nretention time) and a clarifier.  \n\nThe readily biodegradable COD, non-colloidal slowly biodegradable COD, \n\nunbiodegradable soluble COD and unbiodegradable particulate COD were \n\ndetermined by respirometric and/or chemical methods. Five samples were \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\ncollected at the neutralization stage (before the biological treatment) and five to \n\nthe treated effluent \n\nThe readily biodegradable COD was determined by respirometric and \n\nchemical methods. The respirometric method consist in adjust a sample from \n\nneutralization chamber to the relation food/microorganism (F/M) 0.3. The sample \n\nwas saturated with oxygen to a concentration of 7 mg O2/L. When the aeration \n\nstopped, the amount of oxygen was measured every 2 minutes for 30 minutes. \n\nThe specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) was obtained (slope of the graph \n\ndissolved oxygen vs time). The first fraction of the graph SOUR vs time presented \n\nthe readily biodegradable COD.  \n\nThe chemical method consists in a coagulation with Al2(SO4)3 (100 mg/L) \n\nfallowed by a filtration (0,45 \u00b5m) of the samples from the neutralization stage and \n\nfrom the treated effluent. The COD from the coagulated and filtrated sample was \n\nthe readily biodegradable and the non-biodegradable COD, the readily \n\nbiodegradable was obtained subtracting the coagulated and filtrated treated \n\neffluent COD. \n\nThe COD measurement of all the fractions allows also determinate the \n\nnon-colloidal slowly biodegradable COD (gCOD/f of slowly degradable COD), \n\nunbiodegradable soluble COD (gCOD/g of total COD), unbiodegradable \n\nparticulate COD (gCOD/g of total COD), etc. \n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Biological treatment plant specifications \n\nParameter Value \nLines 2 \n\nHydraulic retention time (h) 14.5 \n\nSolids retention time (d) 15 \n\nNitrogen source Urea \n\nPhosphorus source Phosphoric acid \n\nTotal kjeldahl nitrogen dosage per line (kg/d) 311 \n\nTotal Phosphorus dosage per line (kg/d) 90 \n\nReturned biosludge/Inffluent ratio 1 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Inffluent characteristics \n\nParameter Value \nTotal Flow (m3/d) 60000 \n\nTotal COD (kg/d) 42600 \n\nTotal COD (mg/L) 712 \n\npH 7.3 \n\nKjeldahl nitrogen (kg/d) 52 \n\nPhosphorus (kg/d) 58 \n\nTotal suspended solids (kg/d) 8260 \n\n \n\nIn order to determine sludge production and treated effluent \n\ncharacteristics, four scenarios were evaluated. Scenario 1: simulate the biological \n\ntreatment of the current industrial effluent as a reference; Scenario 2: simulate \n\nthe biological effluent treatment without the acidic filtrate but with the added UF \n\npermeate; Scenario 3: simulate the biological effluent treatment without the acidic \n\nfiltrate and without the UF permeate (the permeate from the UF was recycled \n\nwithin the mill) and Scenario 4: Simulate the biological treatment without the \n\nacidic filtrate; and with 25% of replacement of white water on the bleaching plant. \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nUF membrane treatment \nAccording to commercial specification, the ESP04 ultrafiltration membrane \n\nhave resistance to extremes pH and high temperature, this was confirmed by the \n\nresults obtained. No irreversible fouling produced by the swelling of the pores \n\nwas observed and COD and color reduction were achieved.  \n\nThe characterization of the ultrafiltration permeate and retentate obtained \n\nin the pilot plant (Figure 2) is shown in Table 4. The treatment with ultrafiltration \n\nachieved a COD and color removal of 65% and 82%, respectively. It was possible \n\nto concentrate the effluent to a concentration factor (VCF) of 0.92, this means \n\nthat for every 100 L/s treated, the stream of retentate should have a flow rate of \n\n8 L/s. \n\nThe separation and concentration of heavy metals from wastewaters is a \n\nproven application of membrane technology (reverse osmosis) (COX, 2006; \n\nSTOVER, 2012; SAIF; ALMANSOORI; ELKAMEL, 2013). Metal solubility varies \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nwith pH, in a UF-based wastewater treatment system usually the pH is first raised \n\nto precipitate metals out of the solution and then the UF-treatment is carried. \n\n \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Characterization of acidic filtrate and ultrafiltration resulting streams \n\nParameter Acidic effluent UF-Permeate Reduction (%) UF-Retentate \n\nCOD (mg/L) 1650 ? 45 581? 27 64.8 8121 \nColor (CU) 755 ? 31 139 ? 17 81.6 4511 \nNa (mg/L) 170.16 ? 7 143 ? 5 15.8 298 \nCa (mg/L) 14.12 ? 0.5 11.45 ? 0.4 18.9 27.60 \nK (mg/L) 15.32 ? 0.3 12.24 ? 0.5 20.1 27.92 \nMg (mg/L) 1.68 ? 0.1 1.44 ? 0.09 14.2 2.92 \nMn (mg/L) 0.31 ?0.01 0.25 ? 0.01 20.7 0.70 \nBa (mg/L) 0.06 ? 0.01 0.057 ? 0.01 5.1 0.03 \nAl (mg/L) 0.49 ? 0.005 0.45 ? 0.007 8.5 0.75 \nSi (mg/L) 0.54 ? 0.02 0.20 ? 0.03 63.6 2.62 \nP (mg/L) 1.16 ? 0.02 1.00 ? 0.03 14.3 1.19 \nFe (mg/L) 0.36 ? 0.01 0.39 ? 0.01 2.1 0.15 \nCl (mg/L) 8.00 ? 0.6 7.01 ? 0.05 8.1 0.65 \n\n\u00b1 Standard derivation \n\n \n\nIn this case, the pH of the acid filtrate was 3.4, so presumably the metals \n\nare in solution. According to the molecular weight cut-off of the ultrafiltration \n\nmembrane the heavy metals should pass through the membrane and stay on the \n\npermeate fraction. The reduction of metals and inorganics by ultrafiltration was \n\nobserved (Table 2). Silica had the highest removal (63%). Ca, K, Mn and P had \n\na removal of 19, 20, 21, and 14%, respectively. It is reported that metals can be \n\nremoved by the interaction with suspended solids, colloids or fiber (BERNAT et \n\nal., 2007; BERNATA et al., 2008; QIU &amp; MAO, 2013). \n\nIn order to avoid scaling formation of Barite, is necessary to remove barium \n\nfrom the effluent, the UF treatment only removed 5%. \n\nMembrane permeate reuse \nThe barite (BaSO4) deposits formation in the D-stages can be a critical \n\nparameter causing operational problems in the bleach plant. The main source of \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nbarium is the wood and the presence of sulfate is due to the use of sulfuric acid \n\nfor pH regulation or as carry-over from brownstock washing (HUBER et al., 2014). \n\nFigure 3 shows the barite formation in acidic bleaching stages when the \n\nwhitewater was replaced by UF permeate. \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 \u2013 Barite formation in acidic bleaching stages with white water \n\nreplacement. \n\n \n\nThe barium concentration in the UF permeate was 5.7 times greater than \n\nin the whitewater and led to formation of scale deposits after 25% of whitewater \n\nwhere replaced (Figure 3). At this rate, the amount of barium in solid state (as \n\nbarite) is 10%. All the calculations were carried out without considering the \n\ninteraction of the barium and sulfate with the fiber. In some conditions, the barium \n\ncan be adsorbed by the fibers (LITVAY et al., 2003). It is expected that with 25% \n\nof replacement the amount of barite formation will not be a critical problem. With \n\n25% of replacement of whitewater it is possible to reduce the water consumption \n\nin 3.560 m3/d. The non-used whitewater can replace hot water in the (EPO) \n\nwasher, and hot water reused within the mill replacing the clean water intake. \n\nFurther studies must be carried out to determinate the feasibility of this water \n\ncircuit. \n\nIn order to increase the replacement of the whitewater and reduce the \n\nwater consumption it is necessary to reduce the amount of barium and sulfate in \n\nthe fiberline. This can be achieved by improving the de-barking of the wood since \n\nthe barium content of the bark it is much higher than in the stem wood (PERSSON \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nD D1 D2\n\nPr\nec\n\nip\nat\n\ned\n b\n\nar\niu\n\nm\n (%\n\n)\n0% 25% 50% 100%\n\nBlaching stage \n\nWhite water replacement \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\net al., 2002), and by changing the sulfuric acid as a pH regulator and control the \n\ncarry\u2013over from brownstock (RUDIE &amp; HART, 2006). \n\nWith 50% of replacement of whitewater by the UF permeate, 50% of the \n\nbarium formed barite and the risk of scaling increased considerably, considering \n\nthat without permeate reuse the amount of barite is 0% (according to software \n\nsimulation). \n\nEffects on the ETP \nThe characteristics of the treated effluent of the industrial ETP (average of \n\n90 samples) and the results of the model simulation are presented in Table 6. \n\nThe model was developed to obtain a steady-state condition and the results of \n\nScenario 1 were used for validation of the model. The COD fractions obtained \n\nare presented in Table 5. \n\n \n\nTable 5 \u2013 Biological model specifications \n\nParameter Value \nReadily biodegradable COD (gCOD/g of total COD) 0.45 \n\nNon-colloidal slowly biodegradable COD  \n\n(gCOD/f of slowly degradable COD) \n0.17 \n\nUnbiodegradable soluble COD (gCOD/g of total COD) 0.33 \n\nUnbiodegradable particulate COD (gCOD/g of total COD) 0.04 \n\n \n\nThe simulated biological treatment had the same hydraulic retention time \n\n(14.5 h) and solid retention time (15 d). The VSS of the industrial biological reactor \n\nis 2.888 mg/L (mean of 90 samples) and the value obtained at Scenario 1 \n\n(reference) was 2.892 mg/L. The COD removal, NTK, and phosphorus for this \n\nscenario was statistically equal to the real values. There was a difference \n\nbetween the sludge production of 5.4% (larger), because this parameter depends \n\nof kinetic variables (GERNAEY et al., 2004), which some were assumed by the \n\nsoftware (endogenous fraction, aerobic decay rate, maximum specific growth \n\nrate, etc.). \n\nThe results showed that in Scenario 2 (the ETP treats the UF-permeate) \n\nthere was a reduction in the COD load of the final effluent by 38% and the waste \n\nbiosludge production by 36% because of the decrease of the COD load of the \n\naffluent.  \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nIt is expected that in the actual biological treatment, the COD removal \n\nincrease because the large organic molecules are retained by the membrane and \n\nthe permeate had small size molecules that are biodegradable, i.e., there is an \n\nincrease in the biodegradable organic matter ratio of the effluent.

The best \n\nCOD removal was achieved in both cases (acidic and alkaline effluent) with \n\naluminum electrodes. The COD and color removal of the acidic effluent was 51 \n\nand 90% respectively, and the COD and color removal of the alkaline effluent \n\nwas 48 and 73%, respectively. The feasibility of the treated effluent reuse was \n\nevaluated by computer simulation using WinGEMS software and chemical \n\nspeciation methods. According to the steady-state simulation, 100% of the hot \n\nwater can be replaced with treated acidic or alkaline effluent without scaling of \n\ncalcium carbonate. The effect of the EC treatment on the mill effluent treatment \n\nplant was evaluated using BioWin software simulation. Compared with the actual \n\nmill, the reuse of the treated acid effluent decreased the COD load in the final \n\neffluent by 57 %, the waste biosludge generation by 30% and water consumption \n\nby 21%. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Electrocoagulation, bleaching effluent, simulation process, water \n\nreuse. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n \n\nThe pulp and paper mills consume large amounts of fresh water and \n\ntherefore discharge proportionally large volume of effluents. Pulp mills worldwide \n\nhave been required to develop ways to minimize water consumption and effluent \n\ndischarges. \n\nThe treatment of specific in-plant streams seems to be an attractive \n\ntechnical and economical approach because it allows the use of advance \n\ntechnologies such as membrane filtration (QUEZADA et al., 2014) and \n\nelectrocoagulation (ZAIED &amp; BELLAKHAL, 2009).  \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nTraditional methods for dealing with the wastewater consist of biological, \n\nphysical, and chemical processes and their different combinations. The typical \n\ntreatment processes for pulp and paper effluents are chemical precipitation, \n\naerated lagoons and activated sludge. \n\nPhysical chemical technologies such as coagulation/flocculation by \n\nchemical precipitation include three stages of solid/liquid removal. First, the \n\nchemical agent is added to the water to destabilization of the pollutants; second, \n\nthe formation of larger particles via slow mixing, which promotes the collision of \n\nthe particles and the consequent aggregation; and third step is the solid-liquid \n\nseparation by sedimentation or flotation of the formed flocs. In the conventional \n\ntreatment chemicals such as polymers, iron and aluminum salts are used (HOLT \n\net al., 2005). \n\nDespite the availability of the above mentioned methods, effluent \n\ntreatment alternatives with comparative advantages, such as automation of \n\nprocesses and cost, have been studied, highlighting the electrocoagulation (EC) \n\nas a promising technology (CHEN, 2004). \n\nIn electrocoagulation process, an electrochemical reactor carries out the \n\nsteps of convectional coagulation providing the coagulant \u201cin situ\u201d. It is based on \n\ndissolution of the electrode material used as an anode. This so-called \u201csacrificial \n\nanode\u201d produces metal ions which act as coagulant agents in the aqueous \n\nsolution. The electrodes are usually made of aluminum, iron, or stainless steel \n\n(EMAMJOMEH &amp; SIVAKUMAR, 2009).  \n\nDuring EC, the following main reactions with the metal (M) take place at \n\nthe electrodes: \n\nAnode: \n\n( ) ? ( ) +              (1)   2 ? 4 + + 4   \n \n\nCathode: \n\n( ) + ? ( )               (2) 2 + 2 ? ( ) + 2  \n \n\nElectrochemically generated metal cations will react spontaneously, \n\nforming various monomeric species, in the case of aluminum anode, such as \n\nAl(OH)2+, Al2(OH)24+, and Al(OH)4- and polymeric species such as Al6(OH)153+, \n\nAl7(OH)174+, Al8(OH)204+, Al13O4(OH)244+ and Al13(OH)345+. \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nAdvantages of EC over conventional coagulation process include \n\neconomic aspects (relatively low investment cost, maintenance, energy, and \n\ntreatment costs), significantly lower volume of sludge produced, better sludge \n\nquality (lower water content, larger and more stable flocs with better settlability), \n\nsimilar or slightly better efficiency, avoidance of chemical addition, ease of \n\nautomation, simple and compact size of EC system, broad functional pH range \n\nand pH neutralization effect, and the presence of electroflotation (MOLLAH et al., \n\n2001). However, limited researches have been reported the treatment of pulp \n\nbleaching effluent using EC method (SRIDHAR et al., 2011). \n\nAfter EC treatment, a clean water is generated. To develop a water \n\nconservation program in a mill, it is necessary to reuse this stream without risking \n\nthe mill process. The accumulation of elements and compounds in the water cycle \n\ncan cause severe problems in the mill (PARTHASARATHY &amp; \n\nKRISHNAGOPALAN, 2001; DOLD\u00c1N et al., 2011); the most common in the \n\nbleach plant is the formation of barium sulfate, calcium carbonate and calcium \n\noxalate (DUGGIRALA, 2005; HUBER et al., 2014). \n\nScaling occurs when part of the dissolved solids in a solution precipitates, \n\nwhich leads to the formation of layer of solids over contacting surfaces. Scaling \n\nis, therefore, intimately related to the solubility of the compounds present in \n\nsolution (ANTONY et al., 2011). In order to predict the relative solubility of some \n\ncompounds, it is possible to simulate these phenomena using computer \n\nsimulation software (AMIRI &amp; MOGHADASI, 2010). \n\nThe objectives of this study were to i) evaluate the influence of current \n\ndensity, initial pH, electrode material and process time on the electrocoagulation \n\ntreatment of bleaching plant effluents, ii) develop a software simulation tool to \n\nevaluate the feasibility of recycling the clean treated effluents in the bleach plant \n\nand iii) determinate the effects on the effluent treatment plant. \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nEffluent \nThe characteristics of the acidic and the alkaline effluents from the \n\nbleaching plant (Figure 1) of a softwood kraft pulp mill were mesured. The COD, \n\ncolor, conductivity and metals (3 samples) were determined according to \n\nStandard Methods for the Examination of Water (APHA, 2005). The acidic \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\neffluent was obtained from the wash press of the D0 stage and the alkaline \n\neffluent from the wash press from the EOP stage, during normal operation of the \n\nmill. All samples were stored at 5\u00b0C. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Bleaching process and the generated effluents \n\nElectrocoagulation \nThe electrocoagulation (EC) test was carried in a 2L batch electrochemical \n\nreactor (Figure 2) with 8 plates (electrodes) of 13 x 15 cm each and a distance \n\nbetween the electrodes of 1.4 cm approximately. The connection with the power \n\nsource was in parallel, this way the electrodes are monopolar. The EC treatment \n\nwas carried out under constant stirring of 150 rpm. The design of the \n\nelectrochemical reactor was based from previews studies (VALENTE et al., \n\n2012). The initial temperature of the effluent was approximately 25 ?C. \n \n\n \nFigure 2 \u2013 Electrochemical reactor. \n\nD0 D1\n(EPO)\n\nD2Pre\u2013O2\nPulp\n\nHot water White water\n\nAcidic \neffluent\n\nAlkaline \neffluent\n\nBleached \nPulp\n\nWasher Washer Washer Washer\n\nETP\n\nMill effluent\n\nElectrode\n\nEffluentEffluent\n\nStirrer\n\nStirrer\n\nElectrodes\n\nPower\nsource\n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n\nTwo different types of materials for the construction of the electrodes were \n\ntested, aluminum (99% pure) and iron (99.45% pure). For each type of electrode, \n\nit was evaluated the influence of the initial pH, current density (amount of electric \n\nflowing per unit cross-sectional area of material) and the time of reaction. \n\nFor each effluent (acidic and alkaline) was evaluated the \n\nelectrocoagulation with both electrodes composition (aluminum and iron) (Table \n\n1). The experimental design was a Box-Behnken type. It was made 12 \n\ncombinations among the levels of the three factors (pH, current density and time) \n\nand five replicates related to the combination center point for estimation of the \n\nresidual error, totaling 17 experiments per electrode/effluent (68 tests considering \n\nboth electrodes material and both effluents).  The conditions were selected \n\naccording to previous research (CHANWORRAWOOT &amp; HUNSOM, 2012). \n\nThe pH of the sample was adjusted to the condition of the experimental \n\ndesign using NaOH or H2SO4. After the treatment, separation of liquid and solid \n\nwas carried out by sedimentation for a period of 30 minutes. The COD, color and \n\nmetals were determined by according to Standard Methods for the Examination \n\nof Water (APHA, 2005). \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Experimental variables \n\nVariable \nAcidic Effluent Alkaline Effluent \n\nMin Max Min Max \n\npH 3 7 7 12.6 \n\nCurrent intensity (A) 3.12 9.36 3.12 9.36 \n\nReaction time (min) 10 60 10 60 \n\nProcess simulation \nThe feasibility of the reuse of the effluent treated with EC was studied by \n\nprocess simulation, to determined the potential of scaling formation of barium \n\nsulfate (in the acidic stage), calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide (in the \n\nalkaline stage).  \n\nFor mill simulations it was used about 30 data sets, containing about 5 \n\nvariables per set collected at the mill and a full characterization of metals, salts, \n\norganic matter was made. \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nData and the information entry to the WinGEMS models involve solving \n\nmass and energy process balances through interactive calculations. Given the \n\ncomplexity of the bleach plant and the non-process elements (NPE) distribution, \n\nit was necessary to develop a new block with the Pitzer electrolytic solutions \n\nmodel for calculation of chemical equilibrium. The Pitzer model uses as input data \n\nthe composition of a given solution (in terms of molality, or moles of component \n\nper kg of solvent), as well as the several thermodynamic parameters. \n\nUsing the simulation model, the hot water added to the (EPO) press-\n\nwasher was replaced by the acidic or alkaline treated effluent. The simulations \n\nwere run, in each case, to the steady-state condition at water replacement rates \n\nof 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%. \n\nEffects on the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) \nThe effects of the treatment with electrocoagulation of the acidic effluent \n\nand/or the alkaline effluent, on the effluent treatment plant (ETP) were evaluated \n\nby process simulation in BioWinTM (EnviroSim) software. It was determined the \n\nfinal effluent characteristics and sludge production. The mill\u2019s effluent biological \n\ntreatment plant consists of an activated sludge (extended aeration) plant.  Each \n\nline is constituted by 4 biological aerated selectors (2.1, 1.7, 0.9 and 0.9 h of \n\nretention time), a bioreactor (8.9 h of retention time) and a secondary clarifier. \n\nFive scenarios were evaluated for hot water replacement. Scenario 1: \n\nsimulate the biological treatment of the existing industrial effluent plant as \n\nreference; Scenario 2: simulate the biological effluent treatment without the acidic \n\neffluent but with the added acidic treated effluent (EC with aluminum electrode \n\ntreatment); Scenario 3: simulate the biological effluent treatment without the \n\nacidic effluent and without treated acid effluent  (the treated effluent from the EC \n\nwas recycled within the mill); Scenario 4: simulate the biological effluent treatment \n\nwithout the alkaline effluent but with the added treated alkaline effluent (EC with \n\naluminum electrode treatment), and Scenario 5: simulate the biological effluent \n\ntreatment without the alkaline effluent and without treated alkaline effluent  (the \n\ntreated effluent from the EC was recycled within the mill). \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nEffluent characterization \nThe characterization of the acidic and alkaline effluent samples is presented in \n\nTable 2. \n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Acidic and alkaline effluent characterization \nParameter (mg/L) Acidic effluent Alkaline effluent \n\nCOD 1650 ? 31 1035 ? 20 \nColor 755 ? 16 810 ? 7 \nNa 170 ? 13 184 ? 8 \nCa 14.1 ? 1.3 4.7 ? 0.7 \nK 15.3 ? 1.8 6.9 ? 0.6 \n\nMg 1.68 ? 0.12 0.29 ? 0.03 \nMn 0.31 ? 0.03 0.03 ? 0.01 \nBa 0.06 ? 0.01 0.04 ? 0.01 \nAl 0.49 ? 0.03 0.16 ? 0.01 \nCu 0.03 ? 0.01 0.04 ? 0.01 \nSi 0.54 ? 0.01 0.57 ? 0.01 \nP 1.16 ? 0.03 0.39 ? 0.01 \nFe 0.36 ? 0.01 0.17 ? 0.01 \n\nSO4 910 ? 50 250 ? 12 \n                      *Average of three samples \n\nElectrocoagulation of acidic effluent \nThe results of the electrocoagulation treatment of the acidic effluent with \n\naluminum electrodes is presented in the Figure 3. According to the statistical \n\nanalysis, the optimum point for the COD removal was obtained for the initial pH \n\n3.4, the current density 120 A/m2 and the reaction time of 50 minutes. At this \n\ncondition, the final pH was 8 and the COD and color removal was 51% and 90%, \n\nrespectively, considering the reactor volume and the electrode area, the removal \n\nof COD and color was 8 g/Lm2 and 12.000 CU/Lm2, respectively. \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \nFigure 3 \u2013 Contour profiler of the COD removal with electrocoagulation using \n\naluminum electrode. \n\n \n\nThe obtained flocs were well formed, stable and compacted, they floated \n\nwith the H2 generated in the reaction. This flotation phenomenon was described \n\nby other authors as advantages of the electrocoagulation process (MOLLAH et \n\nal., 2001; BUTLER et al., 2011; KHANDEGAR &amp; SAROHA, 2013; SAHU et al., \n\n2014). At the optimum COD removal conditions, the sludge production was 0.21 \n\ng per liter of effluent treated, i.e., the treatment of all the acidic effluent will \n\ngenerate 2.7 t/d of sludge.  Further studies must be carried out to determined the \n\nbest sludge treatment/disposal strategy. \n\nOther advantage of this process is the metals removal, which was \n\nobserved in this study and reported by other authors (EMAMJOMEH &amp; \n\nSIVAKUMAR, 2009; KABDA?LI et al., 2009; CHATURVEDI, 2013; PULKKA et \n\nal., 2014). The reduction of the heavy metals is presented in  Table 3. The treated \n\neffluent had an increase of 1700% in the aluminum concentration after the \n\ntreatment.  \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Elements removal of the acidic effluent using electrocoagulation with \n\naluminum electrode \n\nElement Na Ca K Mg Mn Ba Al Cu Si P Fe \n\nRemoval (%) 0 60 3 65 86 31 -1700 0 100 72 31 \n\n \n\nThe results of the electrocoagulation treatment of the acidic effluent with \n\niron electrode is presented in the Figure 4. \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \nFigure 4 - Contour profiler of the COD removal with electrocoagulation using iron \n\nelectrode. \n\n \n\nThe obtained flocs were well formed and most of them floated with the H2 \n\ngenerated in the reaction. According to the statistical analysis the optimum point \n\nfor the COD removal was obtained when the initial pH was 7, the current density \n\n144 A/m2 and the reaction time 50 minutes. At this condition, the final pH was 11 \n\nand the COD and color removal was 47% and 66%, respectively. Considering the \n\nreactor volume and the electrode area, the removal of COD and color was 7,8 \n\ng/Lm2 and 11.700 CU/Lm2. The color removal was lower than the treatment with \n\naluminum electrode because of the orange coloring of the effluent due to the \n\npresence of Fe(OH) (MOLLAH et al., 2001; MORENO et al., 2007; \n\nCHATURVEDI, 2013). In order to have COD and color removal larger than 20% \n\nthe pH of the effluent, it must be increased to at least 5. This pH adjustment \n\naffects directly on the treatment cost. The reduction of the elements is presented \n\nin the Table 4.  \n\n \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Elements removal of the acid effluent using electrocoagulation with iron \n\nelectrode \n\nElement Na Ca K Mg Mn Ba Al Cu Si P Fe \n\nRemoval (%) 0 77 0 80 100 67 80 0 100 88 -297 \n\n \n\nFor the treatment of the acidic effluent, the EC with aluminum electrode \n\nachieved the higher COD and color reduction without pH adjustment, i.e, more \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nsuitable treatment to generate an effluent capable to be reused within the \n\nprocess. \n\n If the treated effluent is reused within the acidic or alkaline stage, pH, \n\nCOD, calcium, hydroxide and barium amount are critical parameters, because of \n\nthe risk of scaling formation (HUBER et al, 2014) and the increase of chemical \n\ndosage for bleaching (COLODETTE et al., 2006; JANNE et al., 2013; KOSSAR, \n\n2013). Because of pH and elemental composition, the treated acidic effluent was \n\nevaluated to be reused within the process, replacing hot water in the EPO-\n\nwasher. \n\nElectrocoagulation of alkaline effluent \nThe results of the analysis of the electrocoagulation treatment of the \n\nalkaline effluent with aluminum electrode is presented in the Figure 5. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5 - Contour profiler of the COD removal with electrocoagulation using \n\naluminum electrode \n\n \n\nAccording to the statistical analysis the optimum point for the COD removal \n\nwas obtained when the initial pH is 11, the current density 120 A/m2 and the \n\nreaction time 50 minutes. At this condition, the COD and color removal was 48% \n\nand 73%, respectively. Considering the reactor volume and the electrode area, \n\nthe removal of COD and color was 7.2 g/Lm2 and 8.800 CU/Lm2. The obtained \n\nflocs were well formed, stables compacted and uncolored, they floated with the \n\nH2 generated in the reaction. The sludge production was 2.1 t/d of sludge. \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\nThe reduction of the elements is presented in the Table 5. The amount of \n\naluminum increased in the effluent as described by other authors (BOROSKI et al., \n\n2008; TERRAZAS et al., 2010; BUTLER et al., 2011; SAHU et al., 2014) because of \n\nthe dissolution of the electrode. \n\n \n\nTable 5 \u2013 Elements removal of the alkaline effluent using electrocoagulation with \n\naluminum electrode \n\nElement Na Ca K Mg Mn Ba Al Cu Si P Fe \n\nRemoval (%) 0 82 49 90 100 67 -1951 0 100 90 0 \n\n \n\nThe results of the analysis of the electrocoagulation treatment of the \n\nalkaline effluent with iron electrode is presented in the Figure 6. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6 - Contour profiler of the COD removal with electrocoagulation using iron \n\nelectrode \n\n \n\nAccording to the statistical analysis, the optimum point for the COD \n\nremoval was obtained when the initial pH was 10, the current density 85 A/m2 \n\nand the reaction time 50 minutes. At this condition, the COD and color removal \n\nwas 43% and 51%, respectively. Considering the reactor volume and the \n\nelectrode area, the removal of COD and color was 7.5 g/Lm2 and 6.800 CU/Lm2.  \n\nThe reduction of the heavy metals is presented in Table 6. The color \n\nremoval was lower than the treatment with aluminum electrode because of the \n\norange coloring of the effluent due to the presence of Fe(OH). \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nTable 6 \u2013 Elements removal of the alkaline effluent using electrocoagulation with \n\niron electrode \n\nElement Na Ca K Mg Mn Ba Al Cu Si P Fe \n\nRemoval (%) 0 57 33 60 100 55 87 0 100 79 -111 \n\n \n\nFor the treatment of the alkaline effluent the electrocoagulation with \n\naluminum electrode achieved a higher COD and color reduction. Because of \n\nelemental composition, the treated alkaline effluent was evaluated to be reused \n\nwithin the process replacing hot water in the EPO-washer. \n\nProcess simulation and clean water reuse \nThe calcium carbonate formation in the (EPO) filtrate can be a critical \n\nparameter causing operational problems in the bleach plant because of scaling, \n\nparticularly on the pulp washers. In the treated acidic effluent (with EC using \n\naluminum electrode), the calcium concentration was higher (5.6 mg/L) than in the \n\nhot water (1.6 mg/L) and, therefore, it increased when the treated effluent reuse \n\nincreased. Also, a higher concentration of carbonate ions in the treated effluent \n\n(410 mg/L) compared to hot water (were it could not be detected) increased the \n\nformation of calcium carbonate in the (EPO) filtrate (Figure 7). \n\n \nFigure 7 - Calcium carbonate formation in the (EPO) filtrate with hot water \n\nreplacement with treated acidic effluent  \n \n\nIn the treated alkaline effluent (EC with aluminum electrode), the calcium \n\nconcentration was lower (0.8 mg/L) than in the treated acidic effluent (5.6 mg/L) \n\nand in the hot water (1.6 mg/L), therefore, the Ca concentration decreased when \n\nthe treated effluent reuse increased. Also, the concentration of carbonate ions in \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nC\naC\n\nO\n3(\n\ns)\n g\n\n/A\ndt\n\nHot water on EOP-press replaced treated effluent (%)\n\n(EPO) Filtrate\n\nSupersaturation limit\n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nthe treated effluent (75 mg/L) was lower compared to the treated acidic effluent. \n\nWith 100% of replacement, software simulation indicated that there is not calcium \n\ncarbonate in the (EPO) filtrate. \n\nIn both cases (acidic treated effluent or alkaline treated effluent reuse), \n\nsimulation predicts that 100% replacement of hot water in the EOP press should \n\nbe technically possible (saving 7.5 m3/ADt). Supersaturation calculations indicate \n\nthat the precipitation of calcium carbonate will not start even with 100% of the hot \n\nwater being replaced. \n\nEffects on the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) \nThe characteristics of the treated effluent of the industrial ETP and the \n\nresults of the model simulation with treatment of the acidic effluent (EC with \n\naluminum electrode) are presented in Table 8, and the results with treatment of \n\nthe alkaline effluent (EC with aluminum electrode) are presented in Table 9.  \n \n\nTable 8 - Effects of the EC treatment of the acidic effluent on the treatment plant  \n\nParameter \nIndustrial \n\nETP \nScenarios \n\n1 2 3 \n\nCOD (mg/L) 241 ? 17 242 165 103 \nCOD removal (%) 66 ? 2 67 67 67 \nWaste Sludge production (kg/d) 9211 ? 151 9713 6912 6192 \nNTK (mg/L) 0.77 ? 0.2 1.20 1.17 1.13 \nPhosphorus (mg/L) 0.10 ? 0.01 0.2 0.15 0.17 \nTSS (mg/L) 6.01 ? 1.2 5.87 5.7 5.41 \n\n         ?

Standard derivation  \n \n\nIn Scenario 3 (EC treatment of the acidic effluent and reuse replacing hot \n\nwater), the COD of the final effluent and the waste sludge production decreased \n\nin 57% and 36%, respectively, when compared to the reference. In the Scenario \n\n5 (EC treatment of the alkaline effluent and reuse replacing hot water) the COD \n\nof the final effluent and the waste sludge production decreased in 50% and 33%, \n\nrespectively, when compared to the reference. In both cases (Scenario 3 and 5) \n\nthe water economy was 7.4 m3/ADt. \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n \n\nThe main conclusions of this work are: \n\ni) The best removal of COD and color of the acid effluent was achieved with \nelectrocoagulation treatment with aluminum electrode, with a removal of \nCOD and color was 8 g/Lm2 and 12.000 CU/Lm2. \n\nii) The best removal of COD and color of the alkaline effluent was achieved \nwith electrocoagulation treatment with aluminum electrode, with a removal \nof COD and color was 8 g/Lm2 and 8.800 CU/Lm2. \n\niii) If treated acidic effluent is reused to replace 100% hot water in the (EPO)-\npress the amount of CaCO3 will increase 20 g/ADt but will not achieve the \nsupersaturating limit (no precipitation). \n\niv) If treated alkaline effluent is reused to replace 100% of hot water in the \nEPO-press it is not expected to have scaling formation by CaCO3 \nprecipitation. \n\nv) The reuse of the treated acidic or alkaline effluent within the bleaching \nplant will improve the final effluent characteristics, the biowaste sludge \ngeneration and the water consumption.  \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\nvi) Further studies must be carried to determine the best treatment/disposal \nstrategy of the electrocoagulation sludge and the effects of the water reuse \non the final product. \n\nvii) Further studies must be carried to determine the impact of the aluminimun \nin the process and the product during treated effluent reuse.  \n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n\nWe would like to thank the Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde Amparo \u00e1 Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) for the financial \n\nsupport and the Estudantes-Conv\u00eanio de P\u00f3s-Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o program \u2013 PEC-PG, of \n\nCAPES/CNPq - Brazil \n\nREFERENCES \n \n\nAMIRI, M.; MOGHADASI, J.

As output, it calculates the activity \n\ncoefficient of each component in solution. \n\n \n\nActivities \nElectrolytic solutions are known to deviate considerably from what is \n\nknown as an ideal solution. Under this idealization, the electrostatic interactions \n\nbetween the particles of solvent and those of solute - solvent-solute interactions \n\n- would be identical to solvent-solvent and solute-solute interactions. In order to \n\naccount for such deviations, thermodynamics has introduced the concept of \n\nactivity. Activity is sometimes thought as the effective concentrations that a \n\ncompound in a solution. If the concentration (in molal) of a certain component C \n\nin solution is , then its activity  is defined as: \n\n \n\n =                                                         EQ 1 \n \n\nwhere  is known as the activity coefficient of . This coefficient would equal \n\nunity if the solution were ideal, which is notusually the case. \n\n \n\nModel parameters \nThe Pitzer model requires that several parameters be provided so that it \n\nmay accurately describe the solutions under study. We may divide them into the \n\nfollowing ategories:? \n\na) Electrolyte-specific parameters: Parameters related to each specific \nelectrolyte present in the system (e.g. Na2SO4, NaOH, etc.). There are \n\nsix such parameters, namely 1, 2, 0, 1, 2 and .   \n\nb) Ion interaction parameters: These parameters measure the effect of \nelectrical interactions that occur between pairs and triplets of ions \n\n(binary and ternary interactions, respectively). The number of these \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nparameters grows with the number of types of ions in the system, as \n\nmore combina- tions will be possible. The binary interaction parameters \n\nare often written as ,  ? , whereas the ternary parameters are written \n\nas ? .  \n\n \n\nEquilibrium data \nIn order to determine the solubility of a given electrolyte it is necessary to \n\nknow the value of its solubility product, , under the conditions to which it is \n\nexposed. These data were obtained from the following sources: (Zemaitis, Clark, \n\nRafal, &amp; Scrivner, 1986), (Tester &amp; M., 1997).  \n\n \n\nValidation results  \nTo check whether the model implementation was correct, the mean activity \n\ncoefficient, \u00b1, of solutions of NaCl and Na2SO4 was calculated and compared \n\nwith values found in Zemaitis et al. (1986). These solutions were of varying \n\nmolalities, ranging from 0.01 to 4 mol/kg. The results obtained are displayed in \n\nFigures 1 and 2. As would be expected, the model yields mean activity \n\ncoefficients that are quite close to the expected values for relatively low \n\nconcentrations. However, as the concentration increases, the model displays \n\nslight deviations from the expected values.  \n\n \nFigure 1 - Mean activity coefficient of Na2SO4 solutions of varying molalities.

(1986).  \n\n \nTemperature dependence of Ksp \n\n \n\nIn order to account for the effect of temperature on the solubility of burkeite \n\nthe values of Ksp for both sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate were calculated \n\nfrom experimental solubility data (Linke &amp; Seidell, 1965), (Shi &amp; Ronald, 2001). \n\nOnce these values were obtained, they were normalized with respect to the value \n\ncorresponding to 115 \u00b0C, yielding relative values of Ksp. Mathematically:  \n\n \n\nps ( ) = ( ) / k  (115 \u00b0 )                      EQ 2 \n \n\nThe values of relative Ksp of both sodium sulfate and are very close, \n\nespecially for temperatures greater than 110 \u00b0C. These results are in accordance \n\nwith what has been found by Wadsborn (2005). The graph displays decreasing \n\nvalues of relative Ksp (and, therefore, decreasing solubilities) for both salts, which \n\nis also to be expected from solubility data data (Linke &amp; Seidell, 1965), (Shi &amp; \n\nRonald, 2001).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n\nApplication-programming interface.  \nThe WinGEMS block was developed through the Block Development Kit \n\n(BDK) application-programming interface (API), specifically designed to allow \n\nusers to create their own specialized blocks. BKD consists of a collection of static \n\nlibraries, header and source C++ files that, when compiled into a dynamic-link \n\nlibrary (DLL), provide the subroutines to be called by the custom block.  \n\n \n\nFor a WinGEMS block to be implemented, two files are necessary: \n\na) Block DLL: the DLL generated by WinGEMS BDK upon compilation, \nencapsulating all subroutines involved in the calculations performed by \n\nthe block. Most of the work involved in designing a block comes from \n\ngenerating this file.  \n\nb) WGB file: a text file that specifies the target DLL to be sought by \nWinGEMS, the input labels made available to the user through the \n\ngraphical user interface (GUI), as well as the input type and units, such \n\nas \u00b0C, cal/s, etc.  \n\n \n\nUpon initialization, WinGEMS reads the WGB file, which provides it with \n\ninfor- mation on how to manipulate the DLL corresponding to the block (Figure \n\n3). When a simu- lation is performed, WinGEMS calls the target DLL and reads \n\nits result as many times as required by the user. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 \u2013 WinGEMS reads the WGB file upon initialization. Once a simulation \n\nbegins, it then calls the target DLL as many times as necessary. \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nEquilibrium calculations \nThe solubilities of the following electrolytes are considered when \n\nperforming calculations:  \n\n? Burkeite - 2(Na2SO4)(Na2CO3) ? \n\n? CaCO3 ? \n\n? CaC2O4 ? \n\n? Na2C2O4 ? \n\n? Mg(OH)2? \n\n \n\n The equilibrium equations corresponding to the dissolution (or precipitation) of \n\nthese compounds are the following. ? \n\n \n \n\nThe values  measure the advancements of each reaction. These \n\nreactions are associated to the following mass balances.  \n\n \n\n \nSince experimental data is available for burkeite precipitation, the burkeite \n\ncalculations were conducted first and taken as the basis from which all other \n\nconcentrations were found. These calculations allowed for the calculation of \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\nCO32?,SO42? and Na+ concentrations. \nThe concentrations of the remaining electrolytes were calculated using \n\nthese values as inputs: from the concentration of CO32?, the concentrations of \n\nCa2+ was determined. The Mg2+ ions were treated separately and its solubility \n\nproduct was assumed constant due to lack of experimental data. No Pitzer \n\nparameters were found for calcium and sodium oxalate. For that reason, they \n\nwere assumed not to precipitate. The ion pairs and trios whose binary and ternary \n\nin- teractions were considered are shown in Table 1.  \n\n \n\n \nTable 1 \u2013 Binary and ternary interactions considered in equilibrium calculations.  \n\n \n\nThe following Ksp expressions were used: \n\n \n \n\nThese Ksp data were calculated from (Green &amp; Frattali, 1946) and directly \n\nextracted from (Plummer &amp; Busenberg, 1981).  \n\n \nUsing the WinGEMS block \n\nThe model described above was implemented as a WinGEMS block that \n\ntakes one stream as input and one stream. It does not modify the input stream in \n\nany way and displays its calculation results in the Current Values tab that can be \n\nfound in the Edit block menu. The block reads the composition of the input stream \n\nand takes it as input for its calculations. The block is currently able to read the \n\nconcentrations all components, except for that of Mg2+, due to limitations of \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\nWinGEMS BDK and that of CO2?, which is not considered in WinGEMS. These \n\nhave to be input manually in the Initial Values tab.?It is crucial that the stream \n\nvariables are set with the correct units. These are shown in Table 2. \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Correct units in which the stream variables are to be set.  \n\n \nOnce the block is connected and calcium and oxalate concentrations are defined \n\n(if necessary), WinGEMS run normally.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nANEXO B \nMILL CHARACTERIZATION \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Mill sampling points and results \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSamples extracted Na Ca K Mg Mn Ba Al Si P Cl SO4\nTotal \n\nsulphur\nCO3 \n\n(TOC/TIC)\nValues in black mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l g/l\n\nValues in Blue mg/kg mg/kg mg/kg mg/kg mg/kg mg/kg mg/kg mg/kg mg/kg mg/kg mg/kg\n\nWood chips mg/kg DS 150 511 646 179 36,0 5,0 14 63,8 46 200\nWeak black liquor mg/kg DS 49134 118 5360 30,4 7,2 1,96 152 6,62 30,5 620 6200\nSecondary condensates A mg/l liquid 0,26 0,17 ND ND ND 0,005 0,09 2,65&lt;0,09&lt;2\nSecondary condensates B mg/l liquid ND 0,10 ND ND ND 0,01 0,06 0,58&lt;0,09&lt;2\nESP-dust mg/kg DS 248000 130 89000 34 17,2&lt;1&lt;10 64 20&lt;1 223600\nWeek liquor (Green liquor filtrate return) mg/kg DS 5829 375 573 23,7 4,7 0,79 10,0 8,52 13,8 64\nGreen liquor dregs 110,4 3000 700\nGreen liquor (filtered) mg/l 98000 6 9800 ND ND 1,8 11,4 129,4 68,7 920 9500\nLime mg/kg DS 10598 672879 101 5551 128 146 220 429,6 10000&lt;100\nWhite liquor (unfiltered) mg/l 113750 12375 12500 82 ND 3,2 15,6 140,0 69,6 950\nWhite liquor (filtered) mg/l 115000 10 12000 ND ND 13,4 12,0 255,1 16,9 870 16000 5610\nMill Water mg/l 6,7 2,9 0,57 1,3 0,01 0,01 0,13 0,00157\nLime mud (Filtered)\nEffluent from effluent treatment mg/l 230 10 24 2,4 0,26 0,04 0,17 16,9&lt;0,09 200 238\nDigested pulp mg/kg DS liq+pulp 235634 237 29834 736 45,0 6,0 111 102 120 1100\n\nb Digested pulp carryover mg/kg DS 104637 169 12779 622 33 2 65\n1st press brownstock mg/kg DS liq+pulp 57552 552 7036 104 20,0 2,0 170 138 58 500\n2nd press brownstock mg/kg DS liq+pulp 39156 448 4555 73 18,0 4,0 203 98 35 200\n3rd press brownstock mg/kg DS liq+pulp 26923 412 3103 63 19,0 3,0 176 97 44 200\n1st pre bleach press mg/kg DS liq+pulp 19379 382 2067 24 15,0 2,0 162 127 20 100\n2nd pre bleach press mg/kg DS liq+pulp 4798 162 767 9 10,0 2,0 78 - 29&lt;100 6,0\nD0-press (out from) mg/kg DS liq+pulp 1510 122 108 20 4,0 2,0 10\nEOP-press (out from) mg/kg DS liq+pulp 3981 130 76 184 2,0 6,0 40\nD1-press (out from) mg/kg DS liq+pulp 2165 71 45 177 1,0 4,0 29\nD2-stage filter (out from) mg/kg DS liq+pulp 1219 36 22 164 0,6 3,0 20\nFinal pulp mg/kg DS 612 48 13 135 0,6 1,0 7\nBlack liquor to digester mg/kg DS(metals) 23599 128 2596 11 3,2 1,13 11,5 11,3 21,2 360 44,2\nFiltrate from 1st press brownstock mg/kg DS(metals) 18309 59 1793 7,6 1,91 1,14 9,35 4,9 13,2 200 29,3\nFiltrate from 2nd press brownstock mg/kg DS(metals) 12214 39 1221 3,9 0,58 1,16 8,53 5,1 7,5 100 18,3\nFiltrate from 3rd press brownstock mg/kg DS(metals) 7504 2 671 ND ND ND 4,74 3,5 3,4 51 9,2\nFiltrate from 1st pre-bleach press mg/kg DS(metals) 4056 4,0 376 ND 0,59 0,79 7,12 2,1 2,0 47 2,8\nFiltrate from 2nd pre-bleach press mg/kg DS(metals) 659 ND 54 ND ND ND 2,99 3,5 1,0&lt;2 0,64\nFiltrate from D0-press mg/l 170 14 15 1,7 0,3 0,06 0,49 0,5 1,16 910 0,42\nFiltrate from EOP-press mg/l 184 4,7 6,9 0,3 0,03 0,04 0,16 0,6 0,39 250 73,3 0,53\nWhite water mg/l 162 3,22 0,6 0,5 0,03 0,01 0,22 4,3 605 0,11\n\nUnits\n\n\n\n61\n \n\n \n\n      \n\nFigure 1 -  WinGEMS Mill Model \n\n\n\n62\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2 -  Bleach plant water balance"}]}}}
