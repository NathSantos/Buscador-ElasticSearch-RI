My achievements would not have been possible without\nhis scientific guidance and energetic encouragement throughout the years. I feel\ntruly fortunate and thankful for having been trained under his phenomenological\napproach to physical oceanography and to have been able to make that the core\nof my own passionate view of science. Thank you so much for everything you\nmade possible and for being there for me at all times.\n\nI am deeply thankful to Professor Kenneth Brink, who generously received\nme as a guest student at WHOI, and effectively co\u2013advised this research. His\nencouraging and inspiring mentoring have helped shape the science student I\nam today. I am truly indebted to him for his kindness in receiving me in his\noffice nearly every day of my time at WHOI, for his great ideas, and illuminating\ncomments. I also thank him for letting me sit on his Fall course on data analysis\nand for encouraging me to present part of this work on a WHOI COFDL talk. My\nsincere thanks for making this rewarding experience possible.\n\nI am indebted to many other people at WHOI. In particular, I thank Deepak\nCherian for a great deal of numerical modeling\u2013related help and for great sci-\nentific comments and suggestions, as well as other students of the MIT/WHOI\nJoint Program. Thanks are also due to Ke Chen for helpful suggestions with the\nmodel implementation and diagnosis. Technical support from the CIS helpdesk\nwith the WHOI cluster was fundamental in running the numerical experiments.\nI also gratefully acknowledge helpful advice and suggestions from Professors\nGlen Gawarkiewicz, Anthony Kirincich, Magdalena Andres, Joseph Pedlosky\nand Steven Lentz. I am especially grateful to Professor Lentz for the dense and\nmind\u2013bending conversations.\n\nA special thanks to the entire WHOI community for nurturing such a wel-\ncoming and open environment. It makes so much difference. Living next door\n(literally) to Walsh Cottage for six months and being able to sit in Summer GFD\nlectures freely was not a privilege I could ever have dreamed of when I first vis-\nited Woods Hole in Winter/2012.\n\nI gratefully acknowledge help regarding ROMS momentum balance diagno-\nsis from Professor Jianping Gan (HKUST/China), during his visit to WHOI in\nSummer/2014 and later.\n\nI Thank Professor Wilton Arruda (UFRJ/Brazil) for providing the outputs\nfrom the HYCOM numerical experiment and for much helpful input on its anal-\nysis. I also acknowledge his comments and suggestions on the simplified ROMS\nexperiments and on the ATW analytical model.\n\nThanks to Professor Alberto Piola (SHN/Argentina), for helpful suggestions\nregarding the analyses of the observations and for the exciting lectures during\nthe XIII Austral Summer Institute course \u00b4\u00b4Circulation and Water Masses in the\nSouthwest Atlantic\u201d, held in January/2013 at UdeC/Chile.\n\nI am really fortunate to have had excellent instructors, and it is a pleasure to\nacknowledge their dedicated work. In particular, I thank Professors Belmiro Cas-\ntro, Marcelo Dottori, Paulo Polito, Olga Sato, Alberto Piola, Kenneth Brink and\nIlson Silveira for teaching me so much.

The approach consists of analyses of a set of simplified, process\u2013\noriented, primitive\u2013equation numerical models supported by the analyses of an\nindependent, more realistic numerical model and available observations. The\ncross\u2013isobath circulation is found to be strongly dominated by wind\u2013driving,\nconsistent with previous findings. In the model experiments, SACW enters the\nESB shelf through two preferential pathways along the Tubara?o Bight area (TB,\n19.5?S\u201322?S). These pathways are found to be locations where an equatorward\nalong\u2013isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) of ? 2 \u00d7 10?6 m s?2 develops\nin response to steady wind forcing. This equatorward PGFy? is essentially in\ngeostrophic balance, and therefore induces onshore flow across the shelf edge\nand most of the shelf proper. The Brazil Current (BC) imparts an additional equa-\ntorward PGFy? on the shelf. The momentum budget reveals that the ageostrophic\nresidue of the PGFy? is compensated mostly by momentum advection and bottom\nfriction. Buoyancy arrest might be important under more intense SACW intru-\nsion events, as suggested by the maximum observed values of the slope Burger\nnumber (0.32\u20130.92). Among the deep\u2013ocean forcing mechanisms considered, the\nintrinsic pycnocline uplifting effect of the BC seems to be responsible for ?1.4?C\ncolder upwelled water under steady, upwelling\u2013favorable wind forcing, relative\nto a flat stratification scenario. The BC also seems to induce local intrusions by in-\nertially overshooting the shelf edge, consistent with Rossby numbers of ?0.3\u20130.5,\nas estimated for the area along the TB shelf edge. Finally, the planetary ?\u2013effect\nis also related to a background equatorward PGFy?.\n\nIn addition, the steady response of the continental shelf to a periodic (in the\nalong\u2013shelf direction) pressure forcing at the shelf edge is compared with the BC\u2013\nforced primitive\u2013equation numerical solutions. A simple Arrested Topographic\nWave (ATW) analytical model is found to be successful in representing the gen-\neral features of the numerical solutions. The cross\u2013shelf e\u2013folding scales of the\ncross\u2013shelf velocity estimated from the numerical solutions agree in order of\nmagnitude with the cross\u2013shelf penetration scale q?1 =\n\n?\n?2r/(lfs) = 10 km\n\npredicted by the ATW, where r is a linear bottom resistance parameter, l is the\nalong\u2013shelf wavenumber of the forcing at the shelf edge, f is the Coriolis param-\neter and s is the bottom slope. Furthermore, the use of quadratic bottom stress\naccounts for some of the relative increase in the numerical onshore penetration\nscales, which are predicted to be q?1quadratic =\n\n?\n?2CD/(lfs) \u00d7\n\n?\nUbot, where CD is a\n\nquadratic bottom friction parameter and Ubot is the near\u2013bottom velocity magni-\ntude. The kind of steady response to periodic deep\u2013ocean forcing examined here\nmay provide insight into other continental shelves under the influence of western\nboundary currents.\n\nKeywords: Ocean\u2013shelf exchange, coastal dynamics, deep\u2013ocean forcing, cross\u2013shelf\ntransport, Arrested Topographic Wave, Brazil Current, South Atlantic Central Water.\n\n\n\nxiv\n\nResumo\n\nOs caminhos e os mecanismos f??sicos associados ao feno?meno de intrusa?o da\nA?gua Central do Atla?ntico Sul (ACAS) na plataforma continental da Bacia do\nEsp??rito Santo (BES) ao largo da costa sudeste (18?S\u201322?S) sa?o investigados nesta\ndissertac?a?o. A abordagem consiste da ana?lise de experimentos nume?ricos de\nequac?o?es primitivas simplificados, combinados com a ana?lise de um modelo nu-\nme?rico mais completo, e com ana?lise de observac?o?es dispon??veis.

O balanc?o de momen-\ntum revela que o res??duo ageostro?fico da PGFy? e? balanceado principalmente pela\nadvecc?a?o de momentum e pelo atrito de fundo. O mecanismo de desligamento da\ncamada de Ekman de fundo por empuxo1 pode ser importante em eventos mais\nintensos de intrusa?o de ACAS, em raza?o das estimativas do nu?mero de Burger de\ninclinac?a?o2 observado (0.32\u20130.92).

In the present\n\nChapter, a brief regional overview of the western boundary of the South Atlantic\n\nSubtropical gyre is given in Section 1.2, followed by a statement of the dynamical\n\nconstraints involved in cross\u2013isobath flow in Section 1.3. The thesis hypotheses\n\nand objectives are posed in Section 1.4. Chapter 4 Summarizes the main find-\n\nings of Chapters 2 and 3 and presents some of the open questions that could be\n\naddressed by future work.\n\n1.2 Regional overview\n\nThe region of interest of this thesis is located in the western South Atlantic, in\n\nthe western boundary of the anticyclonic large\u2013scale feature known as the South\n\nAtlantic Subtropical Gyre (SASG, Figure 1.1). The SASG extends from the surface\n\ndown to the base of the pycnocline, in the upper ?1000 m of the water column. Its\n\neastern and western boundary currents are the Benguela Current and the Brazil\n\nCurrent (BC), respectively. The quasi\u2013zonal flows of the South Atlantic Current\n\n\n\n2\n\nand the South Equatorial Current (SEC) connect the eastern and western bound-\n\naries of the SASG (e.g., Talley et al., 2011). The SASG encompasses the latitude band\n\nbetween ?10?S and ?40?S, decreasing in meridional extent with increasing depth\n\ndue to the southward shift of the SEC transport (Schmid, 2014).\n\nAs the western boundary current of the SASG, the BC flows poleward in the\n\nform of a Sverdrup return transport, analogous to e.g., the Gulf Stream in the\n\nNorth Atlantic or the East Australian Current (EAC) in the South Pacific. The BC\n\nforms where the southern branch of the SEC impinges on the continental margin\n\nof South America. The bifurcation of the SEC has, however, a complicated depth\n\ndependence. At surface levels, in the domain of the Tropical Water (TW), the SEC\n\nbifurcates in the latitude range 13?S\u201317?S. At pycnocline levels, in the domain\n\nof the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), the bifurcation is located climato-\n\nlogically at ?18.6?S (Figure 1.2, Stramma &amp; England, 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2007;\n\nSchmid, 2014). As a result of this southward shift of the bifurcation with depth,\n\nthe BC thickens downstream, increasing its vertical extension from 350 m at 22.7?S\n\nto 850 m at 27.9?S (Rocha et al., 2014).\n\nThe Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB) is located in the northernmost part of the South-\n\neast Sector (20?S\u201328?S) of the Brazil Current System, close to the pycnoclinic bi-\n\nfurcation latitude of the SEC. In this region, the BC has a conspicuous mesoscale\n\nactivity, with semi\u2013permanent eddies steered by the complex regional topogra-\n\nphy (Soutelino et al., 2011, 2013; Arruda et al., 2013). The ESB continental shelf is\n\nlocated in the coastal domain known as the Abrolhos\u2013Campos Region (ACR, Cas-\n\ntro &amp; Miranda, 1998). In the archetypal coastal regime classification of Loder et al.\n\n(1998), the ESB shelf is as narrow, wind\u2013driven shelf, with a Western Boundary\n\nCurrent at its edge. This type of shelf is usually expected to be oligotrophic,\n\nin contrast to the eutrophic eastern boundary coastal upwelling systems (Walsh,\n\n1988). However, local areas of high biological productivity are known to exist\n\n(e.g., Gaeta et al., 1999), and seasonal coastal upwelling of nutrient\u2013rich SACW has\n\nlong been observed in this region, mostly from satellite data (e.g., Schmid et al.,\n\n1995; Rodrigues &amp; Lorenzzetti, 2001; Castela?o &amp; Barth, 2006; Castela?o, 2012; Mazzini\n\n\n\n3\n\n&amp; Barth, 2013).\n\nHistorically, the neighboring coastal upwelling system of Cape Frio (23?S) has\n\nreceived far more scientific attention (e.g., Allard, 1955; Em??lsson, 1961; Ikeda et al.,\n\n1976; Carbonel, 2003; Franchito et al., 2008). Although there has been some recent\n\ndevelopment on the understanding of the coastal kinematics and dynamics of\n\nthe ESB on the basis of observations and analytical models (Mazzini &amp; Barth, 2013)\n\nand primitive\u2013equation numerical models (Aguiar et al., 2014), numerous basic\n\nquestions remain. For instance, (i) Through which pathways does SACW enter the\n\nshelf in the ESB? and (ii) What are the driving physical mechanisms of these intrusions,\n\nand more specifically what are the effects of bottom topography, wind\u2013driving and the\n\nBC? This thesis addresses these questions. An answer to (i) can contribute to the\n\nbasic description of the regional hydrography, whereas as answer to (ii) is key\n\nin the understanding of the coastal dynamics and of the coupling of the coastal\n\nocean and the deep\u2013ocean.\n\n1.3 The Taylor\u2013Proudman constraint\n\nThe dynamical basis for understanding the mechanisms involved in exchange\n\nbetween the deep\u2013ocean and the continental shelf are embodied in the Taylor\u2013\n\nProudman constraint. In this section, we follow the reasoning in Brink (1998) to\n\narrive at this well\u2013known result.\n\nAssuming that the flow is steady, linear and inviscid, and that the meridional\n\nscale of the flow is not too large, the equations of motion under the hydrostatic\n\nand Boussinesq approximations are\n\n\n\n4\n\nFigure 1.1: Schematic representation of the upper ocean circulation in the South Atlantic.

Plugging Equa-\n\ntions 1.1a and 1.1b into 1.1d yields\n\nwz = 0 (1.2)\n\nrecognizing that flow must not pass through the bottom and assuming that the\n\ndisplacement of the free\u2013surface is negligible (i.e., the rigid\u2013lid approximation)\n\ntranslates into\n\nw = 0 at z = 0 (1.3a)\n\nw = ?u \u00b7?h at z = ?h, (1.3b)\n\nwhere ?? x??x + y??y is the horizontal gradient operator and u ? x?u + y?v is the\n\nhorizontal velocity vector. Combining the surface boundary condition (Equa-\n\ntion 1.3a) with Equation 1.2 implies that w = 0 everywhere, such that Equa-\n\ntion 1.3b becomes\n\nu \u00b7?h = 0 at z = ?h. (1.4)\n\nEquation 1.4 says that there must be no flow against the topography at the bot-\n\ntom, or, equivalently, that bottom flow is constrained to always following iso-\n\nbaths.

Equation 1.8 demonstrates that\n\nvertical shear in steady, linear, inviscid flow on an f\u2013plane is always parallel to\n\nthe flow1, and flow is constrained to following isobaths, as stated by Equation 1.4.\n\nTherefore, relaxing any of the four assumptions made here leads to deviations\n\nfrom geostrophy and in turn to cross\u2013isobath transport. This result holds both in\n\nthe homogeneous and stratified cases, meaning that the existence of stratification\n\nalone is not related to cross\u2013isobath flow.\n\n1.4 Thesis hypotheses and objectives\n\nIn Chapter 2, we test the hypothesis that The Esp??rito Santo Basin continental shelf is\n\nwind\u2013driven at lowest order and modulated by multiple deep\u2013ocean forcing mechanisms\n\nlinked to the Brazil Current at next order. Specifically, the objectives of Chapter 2\n\nare:\n\n\u2022 To characterize the hydrography of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW)\n\nintrusion phenomenon in the Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB);\n\n1An exception is when u = 0 at some level, in which case the flow can decouple, allowing\ngeostrophic flow above the depth of no motion to cross isobaths.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\u2022 To model the effects of bottom topography, wind forcing and the Brazil Cur-\n\nrent on the SACW intrusions in the ESB;\n\n\u2022 To develop a physical understanding of the SACW intrusions in the ESB\n\nfrom kinematic and dynamical standpoints;\n\n\u2022 To examine the momentum budget of the system in the along\u2013isobath direc-\n\ntion and to evaluate leading\u2013order balances and hence cross\u2013isobath trans-\n\nport mechanisms;\n\n\u2022 To rationalize the core physics contained in the observations and numerical\n\nmodels in terms of simpler conceptual and analytical models.\n\nTo pursue these objectives, process\u2013oriented, simplified, primitive\u2013equation\n\nnumerical models are used in concert with a more complete numerical model,\n\navailable observations and simple theoretical ideas.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we further examine the response of the ESB shelf to deep\u2013ocean\n\nforcing. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the time\u2013mean response of the ESB\n\nshelf circulation to the Brazil Current forcing at the shelf edge can be rationalized in terms\n\nof a modified form of the classic Arrested Topographic Wave model (Csanady, 1978). The\n\nobjectives of Chapter 3 are:\n\n\u2022 To derive a simple modified form of the original Arrested Topographic Wave\n\n(ATW) model that includes periodic forcing at the shelf edge and\n\n\u2022 To compare the theoretical predictions from the modified ATW model with\n\nsimplified numerical solutions for the ESB, in particular with respect to the\n\nonshore extent of the Brazil Current influence.\n\nThe analytical ATW model and a subset of the simplified numerical solutions\n\ndiscussed in Chapter 2 are combined to fulfill these objectives.\n\n\n\n9\n\nChapter 2\n\nPathways and mechanisms of\n\noffshore water intrusions on the\n\nEsp??rito Santo Basin (18?S\u201322?S,\n\nBrazil)\n\nAbstract\n\nThe intrusion pathways and physical mechanisms associated with intrusions of\ncold, nutrient\u2013rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) onto the continental\nshelf of the Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB), off southeast Brazil (18?S\u201322?S), are in-\nvestigated. The approach consists of analyses of a set of simplified, process\u2013\noriented, primitive\u2013equation numerical models supported by the analyses of an\nindependent, more realistic numerical model and available observations. The\ncross\u2013isobath circulation is found to be strongly dominated by wind\u2013driving,\nconsistent with previous findings. In the model experiments, SACW enters the\nESB shelf through two preferential pathways along the Tubara?o Bight area (TB,\n19.5?S\u201322?S). These pathways are found to be locations where an equatorward\nalong\u2013isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) of ? 2 \u00d7 10?6 m s?2 develops\nin response to steady wind forcing. This equatorward PGFy? is essentially in\ngeostrophic balance, and therefore induces onshore flow across the shelf edge\nand most of the shelf proper. The BC imparts an additional PGFy? on the shelf,\nwhich is about half as intense as the wind\u2013driven PGFy? and alternates sign. The\nmomentum budget reveals that the ageostrophic residue of the PGFy? is com-\npensated mostly by momentum advection and bottom friction. Onshore bottom\nEkman transport does not seem to have important leading\u2013order effects, possi-\nbly due to buoyancy arrest under more intense SACW intrusion events, as sug-\ngested by the maximum observed values of the slope Burger number (0.32\u20130.92).\nAmong the deep\u2013ocean forcing mechanisms considered, the intrinsic pycnocline\n\n\n\n10\n\nuplifting effect of the BC seems to be responsible for ?1.4?C colder upwelled wa-\nter under steady, upwelling\u2013favorable wind forcing, relative to a flat stratification\nscenario. The BC also seems to induce local intrusions by inertially overshooting\nthe shelf edge, consistent with Rossby numbers of ?0.3\u20130.5, as estimated for the\narea along the TB shelf edge. Finally, the planetary ?\u2013effect is also related to a\nbackground equatorward PGFy?.\n\nKeywords: Ocean\u2013shelf exchange, coastal dynamics, cross\u2013shelf transport, Brazil\nCurrent, South Atlantic Central Water.\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nThe Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB) is located in the western boundary of the South\n\nAtlantic, within the Abrolhos\u2013Campos Region (ACR, Castro &amp; Miranda, 1998),\n\nslightly to the south of the latitude at which the southern branch of the South\n\nEquatorial Current bifurcates, originating the Brazil Current (BC). At surface lev-\n\nels (0\u2013200 m), within the domain of the warm and oligotrophic Tropical Water\n\n(TW), the bifurcation site migrates seasonally in the 13\u201317?S range. At 200 m,\n\nwithin the domain of the cold and eutrophic South Atlantic Central Water (SACW),\n\nthe bifurcation takes place climatologically at 18.6?S, slightly to the north of the\n\nVito?ria\u2013Trindade Ridge (Figure 2.1, Stramma &amp; England, 1999; Rodrigues et al.,\n\n2007).\n\nAt mesoscales, offshore of the shelfbreak, the ESB is dominated by a rich eddy\n\nfield. According to Soutelino et al. (2011), three semi-permanent anticyclones oc-\n\ncupy the surroundings of the Abrolhos Bank (AB, Figure 2.2). Furthermore, to\n\nthe south of the VTR there is a transient cyclonic perturbation of the BC, known as\n\nthe Vito?ria Eddy (VE, Schmid et al., 1995; Arruda et al., 2013). This scenario reveals\n\na complex oceanic circulation in the ESB, which can be expected to be a possi-\n\nble forcing to the SACW intrusions onto the continental shelf. As pointed out by\n\nSoutelino et al. (2013), the presence of cyclones or anticyclones could lead to dif-\n\nferent patterns of ocean\u2013shelf exchange. Hereafter, SACW will be taken to mean\n\nrelatively colder and fresher water on the shelf (compared to the warmer and\n\nsaltier TW).\n\nOn the continental shelf, the main forcing in the banks area is the wind, which\n\n\n\n11\n\nis southwestward year\u2013round, producing southwestward currents (Figure 2.2).\n\nAlong\u2013shelf current variability in the middle shelf is mostly driven by the wind\n\nin the subinertial band, and cross\u2013shelf current variability in the middle shelf is\n\nmostly tidally\u2013induced (Castro et al., 2013). In the inner shelf, the along\u2013shelf\n\ncirculation is mostly driven by the subinertial along\u2013shelf winds (Teixeira et al.,\n\n2013). Shelfbreak upwelling induced by internal tides seems to be important\n\nalong the southern flank of the AB (Pereira et al., 2005), possibly contributing to\n\nthe observed local nutrient enrichment (Gaeta et al., 1999). North of the VTR, the\n\nnewly\u2013formed BC flows offshore, and has little effect on the shelf circulation. In\n\ncontrast, to the south of 19?S, this current is well\u2013defined and follows the shelf\n\nedge closely (Castro &amp; Miranda, 1998). For example, Miranda &amp; Castro (1982) have\n\nobserved a BC transport of ?1 Sv (Sv?106m3s?1) inshore of the shelfbreak at 19?S.\n\nCoastal waters between the AB and Cape Sa?o Tome? are dominated by the in-\n\nfluence of the warm and salty TW year\u2013round. In the AB, the TW occupies most\n\nof the volume of the continental shelf. To the south of the AB (21?S), the influ-\n\nence of the relatively colder and fresher SACW close to the bottom is intermittent.\n\nSuch influence is most intense in summer, when a strong seasonal thermocline\n\nis established in response to the penetration of this oceanic water mass onto the\n\ncontinental shelf (Castro &amp; Miranda, 1998).\n\nThe first study to consider the dynamics of the coastal circulation under steady\n\nwind forcing in the ESB was carried out by Rodrigues &amp; Lorenzzetti (2001). The au-\n\nthors addressed the effects of coastline geometry and bottom topography on the\n\ncoastal circulation, using a set of three process\u2013oriented experiments with a two\u2013\n\nlayer numerical model. They suggest that bottom topography is more important\n\nthan coastline geometry in controlling the time\u2013averaged coastal upwelling re-\n\nsponse in the Tubara?o Bight (TB) area (19.5?S\u201322?S). The more simplified analyti-\n\ncal approach employed by Mazzini &amp; Barth (2013) further clarified the upwelling\n\nmechanisms related to wind forcing and coastal geometry, by breaking down the\n\nvertical transport into two wind\u2013forced components (coastal Ekman transport\n\ndivergence and Ekman pumping) and two topographically\u2013forced components\n\n\n\n12\n\n(shear vorticity and curvature vorticity). Specifically, they show that the TB re-\n\ngion to the north of Vito?ria (?19.5?S\u201320.5?S, see Figure 2.1) is where the Ekman\n\ntransport\u2013forced upwelling is a maximum (?0.75 m2 s?1). In addition, they esti-\n\nmate that wind\u2013driven (topographically\u2013driven) upwelling in the TB area is more\n\nthan 75 % (less than 25 %) of the total upwelling, with the Ekman transport diver-\n\ngence accounting for nearly the entire wind\u2013driven signal (80\u2013100 %). This also\n\nsubstantiates earlier results from Castela?o &amp; Barth (2006), confirming that the con-\n\ntribution of Ekman transport divergence is far more important to vertical trans-\n\nport in the TB than Ekman pumping.\n\nAlthough deep\u2013ocean forcing mechanisms related to the BC seem to be rel-\n\nevant to coastal upwelling south of the ESB (Calado et al., 2010; Palo?czy et al.,\n\n2014), their effects within the ESB have only recently been examined in the study\n\nby Aguiar et al. (2014). The authors performed diagnostic analyses of a realis-\n\ntic primitive\u2013equation numerical model to quantify the upwelling contributions\n\nfrom Ekman transport, Ekman pumping, encroaching of the BC1 onto the shelf\n\nand cyclonic BC meandering2. They found that BC encroaching is generally more\n\neffective than cyclonic meanders in driving SACW intrusions within the TB area.\n\nAguiar et al. (2014) also point out that coastal Ekman transport divergence is the\n\nmost effective forcing mechanism around 21?S, consistent with the previous find-\n\nings of Castela?o &amp; Barth (2006) and Mazzini &amp; Barth (2013).\n\nThe above review shows that much remains to be learned on the SACW intru-\n\nsion processes within the ESB. The aim of this study is to answer the following\n\nquestions:\n\n1. Through which preferential pathways (if any) does SACW penetrate onto the\n\ncontinental shelf within the ESB?\n\n2. What are the driving physical mechanisms of the cross\u2013isobath circulation\n\non the continental shelf? Specifically, what are the individual and combined\n\n1\u00b4\u00b4Encroaching\u201d is taken to mean the inertial overshooting of the BC jet onto the shelf as it\nencounters a sharp change in isobath orientation.\n\n2Cyclonic meanders produce vertical transport either by uplifting the pycnocline and propa-\ngating along the shelf edge of by drawing water from the shelf, thereby producing an additional\nreturn flow.\n\n\n\n13\n\neffects of bottom topography, wind\u2013driving, and the Brazil Current?\n\nThe approach chosen consists of analyses of a set of process\u2013oriented experi-\n\nments with a simplified primitive\u2013equation numerical model, supported by anal-\n\nyses of an independent, more realistic numerical model and available observa-\n\ntions. We first describe the datasets in Section 2.2 and the numerical models in\n\nSection 2.3. Next, in Section 2.4, we analyze the pathways through which SACW\n\nmay enter the ESB shelf. We then address the dynamics linked to the intrusion\n\nprocesses in Section 2.5, and attempt to isolate and rationalize some of the phys-\n\nical mechanisms involved in Section 2.6. We conclude by summarizing the pri-\n\nmary results and presenting conclusions in Section 2.7.\n\n2.2 Datasets\n\n2.2.1 In situ quasi\u2013synoptic hydrographic and velocity data\n\nThe in situ data used in this study come from five quasi\u2013synoptic oceanographic\n\ncruises: Abrolhos 1 (September/2004), Abrolhos 2 (March/2005), PRO\u2013ABRO-\n\nLHOS (September/2007), AMBES 09 (October/2012) and AMBES 10 (May/2013).\n\nHereafter we will refer to these surveys as SEP04, MAR05, SEP07, OCT12 and\n\nMAY13, respectively.

ROMS is a free\u2013surface, terrain\u2013following coordinate model that\n\n\n\n17\n\nsolves the primitive equations of motion under the Boussinesq and hydrostatic\n\napproximations.\n\nThe west boundary is closed and the east, south and north boundaries are\n\nopen. Different forms of radiation/nudging boundary conditions are used for\n\nthe tracers and barotropic/baroclinic velocity components. Harmonic (i.e., Lapla-\n\ncian) lateral mixing is used for momentum and tracers. Momentum (tracer) mix-\n\ning is computed along S\u2013surfaces (geopotential surfaces). A sponge layer with\n\n?15 grid points was used at the open boundaries, where the horizontal viscosity\n\ncoefficient AH was linearly ramped from its interior value of 10 m2 s?1 to 100 m2\n\ns?1 at the open boundaries. The vertical viscosity coefficient AV is found at each\n\ntime step with the Mellor\u2013Yamada level\u20132.5 turbulent closure scheme (e.g., Wi-\n\njesekera et al., 2003). Bottom stress was parameterized using a quadratic bottom\n\ndrag law, with a canonical value of CD = 3 \u00d7 10?3.\n\nThe horizontal grid is rectangular (spanning the 41.6?W\u201336.1?W, 23.3?S\u201318.2?S\n\nlongitude\u2013latitude box) and has an average resolution of ?930 m. The form of\n\nthe vertical stretching curve was chosen such that the spacing of the 50 verti-\n\ncal S\u2013levels was no coarser than 45 m. Bottom topography from an updated\n\nversion of the Smith &amp; Sandwell (1997) dataset (SRTM30\u2013plus dataset, available\n\nat http://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html) is used. The\n\n30\u2013arcsecond raw topography data was linearly interpolated to the model grid,\n\nand capped at 1200 m. The topography was then smoothed with a Hanning win-\n\ndow.\n\nThe stretching curve, the number of vertical levels, the amount of smooth-\n\ning applied and the maximum model depth were chosen to bring the spuri-\n\nous velocities produced by the Horizontal Pressure Gradient Errors (HPGEs) to\n\na tolerable level, while maintaining a reasonable computational cost and retain-\n\ning desired morphological features. The optimal combination of grid parame-\n\nters was that which minimized the quantities ?h/h (Beckmann &amp; Haidvogel, 1993)\n\nand ?z/z (Haney, 1991). These ratios quantify the hydrostatic consistency of the\n\ngrid, by means of the maximum steepness of the bottom topography and inte-\n\nhttp://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html\n\n\n18\n\nrior S\u2013surfaces, respectively. ?h/h ? (hi ? hi?1)/(hi + hi?1), where h is the\n\ndepth of a grid cell and i is an index in either horizontal direction. ?z/z ?\n\n(zi,k ? zi?1,k + zi,k?1 ? zi?1,k?1)/(zi,k + zi?1,k ? zi,k?1 ? zi?1,k?1) is like a three\u2013\n\ndimensional version of ?h/h. The final value of each of these parameters is the\n\nabsolute maximum found after iterating over all grid cells in both horizontal di-\n\nrections.\n\nThe effects of the seamount chain (the VTR) and the smaller\u2013scale topographic\n\nfeatures on the continental shelf were examined using two separate grids, differ-\n\nent only with respect to bottom topography. On the first grid, the topography\n\nunderwent the least possible smoothing, with the single purpose of decreasing\n\nthe HPGEs. On the second grid, the seamount chain was totally removed, and\n\nthe topography was further smoothed to filter out the smaller\u2013scale topographic\n\nfeatures of the continental margin. A comparison of the rough and smooth to-\n\npographies is shown in Figure 2.4.\n\nFigure 2.4: Bottom topographies used in the simplified model experiments. (a): Rough (real-\nistic) topography grid. (b): Smooth (idealized) topography grid. Model grid details are shown\non the right panel, and are identical for both grids, except for the hydrostatic consistency ratios\n?h/h and ?z/z.\n\nFlat stratification scenario\n\nThe flat\u2013stratification initial conditions were derived from the WOA13 tempera-\n\nture and salinity fields. First, the summer climatological profiles shallower than\n\n200 m were averaged together over the ESB (22?S\u201318?S), to produce a rough rep-\n\n\n\n19\n\nresentation of the mean summer stratification on the continental shelf. Then, a\n\nrectangular area to the south of the VTR and away from the shelf edge was chosen\n\nto produce a second pair of spatially\u2013averaged T\u2013S profiles, meant to represent\n\nthe deep\u2013ocean stratification. The distance to the shelf edge was chosen to be\n\n10 first\u2013mode baroclinic radii of deformation (Ld), with Ld ?40 km (Houry et al.,\n\n1987). This choice was motivated by the desire to represent an ocean approxi-\n\nmately at rest, where the stratification is not perturbed by the signal of a western\n\nboundary current in thermal wind balance. The shallow and deep profiles were\n\nthen merged smoothly and interpolated to the vertical model grid at all horizon-\n\ntal grid points.\n\nBrazil Current parameterization\n\nThe BC was parameterized using the methodology known in the literature as\n\nFeature\u2013Oriented Regional Modeling System (FORMS, Gangopadhyay &amp; Robinson,\n\n2002). Briefly, FORMS consists of empirically\u2013analytically parameterizing the wa-\n\nter mass and velocity structures of regional synoptic features (e.g., fronts or ed-\n\ndies) using parameters chosen on the basis of previous observational knowledge.\n\nWithin the FORMS framework, we chose the velocity\u2013based backward approach\n\n(Lozano et al., 1996; Gangopadhyay &amp; Robinson, 2002). This approach consists of pa-\n\nrameterizing the velocity field of the chosen synoptic feature, and then deriving\n\nthe tracer fields from it. The BC jet structure was parameterized as a surface\u2013\n\nintensified, isobath\u2013following Gaussian jet, using the formulation of Soutelino\n\net al. (2013). The mass structure (i.e., the temperature and salinity fields) was\n\ncalculated from the velocity field assuming that the jet is in thermal wind balance\n\nwith the density field. Details of this methodology are found in Soutelino et al.\n\n(2013).\n\nThe parameters chosen for the model BC jet are intended to represent the ap-\n\nproximate core velocity, volume transport and geometry (width and vertical ex-\n\ntent) of the real BC as observed within the ESB (e.g., Miranda &amp; Castro, 1982; Evans\n\net al., 1983; Stramma et al., 1990; Rodrigues et al., 2007; Silveira et al., 2008; Arruda\n\n\n\n20\n\net al., 2013). The transport (core velocity) was -3.2 Sv (-50 cm s?1). The Gaussian\n\nwidth (depth) of the jet was 80 km (150 m).\n\nMass conservation was prescribed along the north (incoming flow) and south\n\n(outgoing flow) boundaries, with a variable Coriolis parameter in the thermal\n\nwind relation. No flow through the east boundary was prescribed. The Inter-\n\nmediate Western Boundary Current jet, whose core lies typically at ?800 m (e.g.,\n\nBoebel et al., 1999; Legeais et al., 2013) was not parameterized, under the assump-\n\ntion that it is not a relevant direct forcing of the intrusions of SACW onto the con-\n\ntinental shelf.\n\nModel wind forcing\n\nThe steady wind forcing employed in the numerical experiments is spatially\u2013\n\nuniform and upwelling\u2013favorable (southwestward). The wind stress was linearly\n\nramped to its full magnitude (0.072 N m?2) over a local inertial period (?34 h).\n\nThe magnitude of the model wind forcing was chosen based on the time\u2013mean of\n\nthe along\u2013shelf component of the wind stress (?sy, parallel to the ?-40.5?coastline\n\ntilt) taken over the summer months (January\u2013March), and averaged over the TB\n\nshelf area. The ?sy series was derived from the time\u2013average of the 1988\u20132013\n\ndaily scatterometer dataset, considering only upwelling\u2013favorable (i.e., ?sy &lt;0)\n\nsnapshots. The wind stress vector ~?s = (?sx)x? + (?sy)y? was derived from the\n\nwind velocity vector ~U = (Ux)x? + (Uy)y? 10 m above the sea surface using the\n\nstandard bulk formula ~? = ?aCDa||~U||~U, where x?, y? are the unit vectors in the\n\ncross\u2013shelf and along\u2013shelf directions, respectively, ?a is the air density (assumed\n\nto be 1.226 kg m?3) and CDa is the drag coefficient. CDa was parameterized using\n\nthe traditional formula from Large &amp; Pond (1981), modified for low wind speeds\n\naccording to Trenberth et al. (1990).\n\n2.3.2 Process\u2013oriented simplified experiments\n\nIn this study, we chose a process\u2013oriented approach, in which the responses of\n\nthe system to different forcing scenarios are diagnosed and compared. A set of\n\n\n\n21\n\nsemi\u2013idealized numerical experiments was designed to investigate the individ-\n\nual and combined effects of bottom topography, wind forcing and deep\u2013ocean\n\nforcing. Here, deep\u2013ocean forcing is taken to mean the effects of the time\u2013mean\n\nBC jet, without mesoscale eddies. Specifically, we performed each experiment\n\nwith different combinations of the following features: 1) Either flat stratification\n\n(horizontal isopycnals) or BC stratification (tilted isopycnals); 2) Either smooth\n\n(idealized) or rough (realistic) topography and 3) Either no wind forcing or steady\n\nwind forcing.\n\nIn this process\u2013oriented framework, we first sought a BC\u2013free scenario with\n\nflat stratification, and then compared it with a stratification scenario typical of an\n\nidealized, mean BC jet. The comparison of the model results in both scenarios\n\nprovided insight on the role of the mean baroclinic signal of the BC, i.e., the in-\n\ntrinsic uplifting of isopycnals linked to the geostrophic shear of the current, and\n\nother effects related to the interaction of the BC flow with the continental shelf.\n\nTable 2.1 summarizes the set of process\u2013oriented experiments performed.\n\nEach experiment was run for 21 local inertial periods (one local inertial period\n\n?34 h), or ?30 days. Instantaneous outputs were averaged over half an inertial\n\nperiod. In the following sections, the model fields described are time\u2013averages\n\nof the entire 30\u2013day simulation, unless otherwise noted. The rationale for this\n\nchoice is that experiments with the BC develop energetic instabilities along the\n\ncontinental slope, therefore introducing unwanted time\u2013dependent biases on the\n\ninstantaneous fields. This effect was minimized by averaging over the first 30\n\ndays of the simulation. The choice of averaging over this amount of time was\n\nmotivated by the fact that, in runs where the idealized BC is present, the shelf\u2013\n\naveraged horizontal kinetic energy completes approximately two periods in 30\n\ndays (not shown).\n\n2.3.3 Realistic experiment\n\nAs an independent verification of our interpretations of the simplified, process\u2013\n\noriented ROMS experiments, we used outputs from a more complete regional\n\n\n\n22\n\nTable 2.1: Outline of the process\u2013oriented numerical experiments performed with ROMS.\n\nExperiment Initial/boundary conditions Topography Wind forcing\n\nEXP\u2013smoo\u20131 Flat stratification Smooth Steady\nEXP\u2013smoo\u20132 Mean BC jet Smooth None\nEXP\u2013smoo\u20133 Mean BC jet Smooth Steady\nEXP\u2013real\u20131 Flat stratification Rough Steady\nEXP\u2013real\u20132 Mean BC jet Rough None\nEXP\u2013real\u20133 Mean BC jet Rough Steady\n\nnested implementation of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), orig-\n\ninally analyzed by Arruda et al. (2013). First, the coarser (1?/4 horizontal reso-\n\nlution) parent simulation was run for the entire Atlantic Basin (65?S\u201360?N) from\n\n1948 through 2009, initialized with climatological fields and forced with monthly\n\nmeans of atmospheric reanalysis fields. Next, a finer (1?/24 horizontal resolution)\n\nchild grid for the western South Atlantic region (54?W\u201332?W and 34?S\u201312?S) was\n\nrun from 2004 through 2009, forced with the same atmospheric products as the\n\nparent simulation and with lateral boundary conditions derived from the parent\n\nsimulation fields.

(2013).\n\n2.4 South Atlantic Central Water intrusion pathways\n\nIn this section, we examine the pathways through which SACW may enter the\n\nshelf. We begin with simple analyses of the hydrographic observations, and then\n\nseek more detailed evidence in the simplified and realistic numerical solutions.\n\n2.4.1 Observational setting\n\nOne of the striking features of the ESB is seasonal coastal upwelling. This process\n\nis relevant to the present study because it is well\u2013known that the cold water that\n\noutcrops during coastal upwelling events has a high SACW content. Therefore, in-\n\nvestigating the surfacing of the thermocline in the ESB is likely to provide insight\n\non the intrusion processes we are ultimately concerned with.\n\nSatellite\u2013derived SST images found in previous studies reveal a SST minimum\n\non the shelf centered at ?21?S, which is most intense during summer (e.g., Mazz-\n\n\n\n23\n\nini &amp; Barth, 2013, their Figure 5). The summer climatological SST field shown in\n\nFigure 2.5a supports these observations, depicting a signal that is likely the re-\n\nsult of the averaging of transient coastal upwelling plumes. This climatological\n\nplume has a minimum temperature of ?24.5?C, originates at ?19.5?S and widens\n\ndownstream, reaching the shelf edge at ?21?S.\n\nThe wind regime is, on average, strongly upwelling\u2013favorable. Considering\n\nthe time series derived from the daily scatterometer dataset, the along\u2013shelf com-\n\nponent of the wind stress vector ?sy was upwelling\u2013favorable 80 % of the time\n\nin the period 01/01/2002\u201309/02/2013. This result highlights the likely leading\u2013\n\norder effect of the wind forcing in coastal upwelling in the ESB. A similar conclu-\n\nsion was reached for the Cape Sa?o Tome? area (22?S), where ?sy was upwelling\u2013\n\nfavorable 78 % of the time between 2000 and 2011 (Palo?czy et al., 2014).\n\nThe question of how the SACW gets to the coast before outcropping then arises.\n\nDoes it penetrate on the shelf locally or upstream (north) of the SST minimum? As\n\na first attempt to answer this question, a simple analysis of the near\u2013bottom tem-\n\nperature observations was done, as the cold SACW signal is observed roughly in\n\nthe lower half of the water column, and is bottom intensified. Figure 2.5b shows a\n\nmap of near\u2013bottom temperature, indicating stations where SACW was observed.\n\nThe 21?C isotherm was chosen as a tracer for SACW. This choice was based on the\n\nknowledge that the average SST observed during upwelling events within the ESB\n\nis ?21?C (Castro et al., 2006). During four of the five synoptic scenarios analyzed,\n\nSACW was observed at least once at every alongshore location sampled between\n\n19.5?S and 21.5?S. The only exception was the MAY13 survey, when no water\n\ncolder than 22.3?C was observed inshore of the 100 m isobath. SACW was not\n\nobserved to the north of 19.5?S (Figure 2.5c). The lowest temperature observed\n\non the shelf was 16.4?C, around the 50 m isobath at the southernmost transect\n\nof the OCT12 survey. Evidently, this result does not mean that SACW never en-\n\nters the shelf north of 19.5?S. Rather, it suggests that intrusion events tend to be\n\nmore common to the south of the seamount chain (the Vito?ria\u2013Trindade Ridge,\n\nVTR), all along the Tubara?o Bight (TB) and the southern flank of the wide Abrolhos\n\n\n\n24\n\nBank (AB).\n\nThe scattered Temperature\u2013Salinity (T \u2013S) diagram in Figure 2.5b highlights\n\nthe typical water mass structure on the ESB shelf. Warm and salty TW in the mixed\n\nlayer interfaces with cold and fresh SACW advected onshore from the oceanic py-\n\ncnocline, with little evidence of a modified (fresher) coastal water mass. This\n\nstresses the point made in the previous paragraph, as the water with highest\n\nSACW content (coldest and freshest) is observed to the south of the seamount\n\nchain (VTR) rather than to the north of it.\n\nThe cross\u2013shelf structure of the temperature field in the ESB (Figure 2.5d) re-\n\nveals the well\u2013known presence of the BC jet. The thermocline (and the pycn-\n\nocline) is uplifted near the shelf edge, and a layer of relatively cold, fresh and\n\ndense water occupies the shelf. There is a variety of possible physical mecha-\n\nnisms related to the BC that may play a role in the intrusions of SACW. Perhaps\n\nthe simplest of those is the fact that colder branches of SACW are available at the\n\nshelf edge simply due to the presence of the BC there. It will be argued that this\n\nuplifting of the main thermocline is one of the leading\u2013order deep\u2013ocean mech-\n\nanisms involved in the problem, as previously pointed out for other nearby up-\n\nwelling systems such as the Cape Sa?o Tome? (22?S, Palo?czy et al., 2014) and Cape\n\nFrio (23?S, Cerda &amp; Castro, 2014) areas.\n\nBuoyancy arrest and frictional spindown predictions\n\nIf along\u2013shelf scales are assumed to be much larger than cross\u2013shelf scales, the na-\n\nture of the response of the shelf circulation to wind forcing in the low\u2013frequency\n\nband (i.e., days to weeks3) is expected to be dominated by the barotropic mode\n\nwhen the quantity S2 = ?2N2/f2 is small (where ?, N and f are representative\n\nvalues for the bottom slope, buoyancy frequency and Coriolis parameter, respec-\n\ntively). Furthermore, the wind\u2013driven flow fluctuations at the shelf edge are ex-\n\npected to be negligible compared to fluctuations near the coast when S = ?N/f is\n\nsmall (Clarke &amp; Brink, 1985), meaning that the entire wind\u2013driven flow is trapped\n\nwithin the shelf and has little effect on the circulation in the shelf edge area. It is\n3Synoptic\u2013scale atmospheric systems, in the so\u2013called \u00b4\u00b4weather band\u201d.\n\n\n\n25\n\ntherefore insightful to estimate S from the CTD data.\n\nTable 2.2 shows shelf\u2013averaged (stations shallower than 100 m) values for\n\neach of the five surveys within the TB area. The average bottom slope in the TB\n\narea is ? = 2.3 \u00d7 10?3, and a reference absolute value for the Coriolis parameter\n\nis f = 5.1 \u00d7 10?5 s?1. S2 varied between 0.10 and 0.85, and S between 0.32 and\n\n0.92. This implies that a significant baroclinic response is predicted throughout\n\nthe shelf, and that the low\u2013frequency wind\u2013driven circulation at the shelf edge is\n\nexpected to have a non\u2013negligible amplitude. This picture stands in contrast with\n\nregions where S2 is much smaller and the shelf response is quasi\u2013barotropic, such\n\nas the wintertime South Brazil Bight (S2 = 1.6\u00d710?4\u20131.9\u00d710?2, Stech &amp; Lorenzzetti,\n\n1992), the Sa?o Paulo Continental Shelf (S2 = 2.2 \u00d7 10?4\u20133.0 \u00d7 10?4, Dottori &amp; Cas-\n\ntro, 2009)4 or the wintertime West Florida Shelf (S2 = 5.0 \u00d7 10?5, Clarke &amp; Brink,\n\n1985). The baroclinic response to low\u2013frequency wind forcing in the TB shelf is\n\nnot expected, however, to be as energetic as in other regions, such as the Peruvian\n\nshelf (S2 = 1.10\u20132.25, Clarke &amp; Brink, 1985; Lentz &amp; Chapman, 2004).\n\nAnother implication of the size of S is how effective buoyancy arrest is ex-\n\npected to be. In a stratified, sloping bottom Ekman layer, cross\u2013shelf buoyancy\n\nadvection produces a horizontal density gradient, which brings the near\u2013bottom\n\nalong\u2013shelf velocity (hence along\u2013shelf bottom stress) to rest through thermal\n\nwind shear. The absence of bottom stress implies no bottom Ekman transport.\n\nThis mechanism is known as buoyancy arrest (e.g., Garrett et al., 1993; Brink &amp;\n\nLentz, 2010). A rough estimate of the timescale Tbuoyancy over which this phe-\n\nnomenon is expected to occur is given by the quantity (S2f)?1 (Garrett et al., 1993).\n\nFor the five datasets considered here, Tbuoyancy varies from 55 h to 7 h, with a\n\nmean value of 15 h. This suggests that buoyancy arrest may happen fast enough\n\nin the strongest SACW intrusion events, where the shelf\u2013averaged N2 is largest,\n\nand Tbuoyancy is shortest. However, a more thorough examination of the potential\n\nimportance of buoyancy arrest would have to account for its along\u2013shelf scale\n\n(Brink, 2012).\n4The Sa?o Paulo Continental Shelf (?23?S\u201326?S) is located in the central part of the South Brazil\n\nBight (?22?S\u201328.5?S). In fact, Dottori &amp; Castro (2009) applied Clarke &amp; Brink (1985)\u2019s numerical\nmodel to this region, showing that it effectively predicts moored velocity observations.\n\n\n\n26\n\nAlternatively, the wind\u2013driven flow may simply undergo frictional adjust-\n\nment before buoyancy arrest takes place. A first estimate of the frictional adjust-\n\nment timescale Tfriction is given by the quantity H/r (e.g., Brink, 1998), where H is\n\nthe local depth and r is a linear bottom resistance coefficient. Assuming a canon-\n\nical value of 3\u00d710?4 m s?1 for r, Tfriction is 65 h at the 70 m isobath, and 19 h at the\n\n20 m isobath. Compared to the 7 h\u201355 h estimated range for Tbuoyancy, it seems that\n\na combination of buoyancy\u2013 and friction\u2013induced adjustment of the flow should\n\nbe expected, with the buoyancy effects possibly being more important during\n\nstronger SACW intrusion events.\n\nTable 2.2: Shelf\u2013averaged stratification frequency squared (N2), slope Burger number (S ?\n?N/f) and its square for the Tubara?o Bight (TB) area (19.5?S\u201322?S).\n\nSurvey N2 [10?4s?2] ?2N2/f2 ?N/f\n\nSEP04 1.03 0.22 0.46\nMAR05 4.10 0.85 0.92\nSEP07 0.49 0.10 0.32\nOCT12 2.10 0.44 0.66\nMAY13 1.16 0.24 0.49\nAverage 1.78 0.37 0.57\n\n2.4.2 Model kinematics of SACW intrusions\n\nWhile the synoptic observations discussed in the previous section yield some\n\nqualitative conclusions on the SACW intrusions, a more detailed examination of\n\nthe pathways and physical mechanisms involved require a numerical approach.\n\nWe start by looking at the passive tracer (dye) fields from the process\u2013oriented\n\nnumerical experiments.\n\nPassive tracer distributions\n\nThe dye fields were initialized by setting the dye concentration (in kg m?3) to\n\nbe numerically equal to the local depth (in meters) at each grid point. Figure 2.6\n\npresents snapshots of horizontal distributions of the fractional thickness of the\n\nlayer occupied by water initially offshore of the 70 m isobath (approximately the\n\nshelfbreak depth). In other words, it shows the thickness of the layer occupied by\n\n\n\n27\n\nFigure 2.5: Hydrographic observations in the ESB shelf. (a): Sea Surface Temperature (SST)\nsummer climatology. (b): Scattered T \u2013S diagram for two contrasting hydrographic snapshots:\nCyan (magenta) dots correspond to a scenario with (without) SACW on the shelf. (c): Near\u2013bottom\ntemperature map derived from all CTD casts of the five synoptic cruises. The black dots mark\nthe locations of all CTD casts. The blue dots mark the casts shallower than 100 m where the\nnear\u2013bottom temperature was lower than 21?C (a qualitative evidence of water with high SACW\ncontent). (d): Cross\u2013shelf temperature section from the SEP04 survey (September/2004) along a\ntransect at the narrowest part of the shelf. The black triangles along the top of the figure mark\nthe along\u2013transect positions of the CTD casts. The green dots on the map insert mark the position\nof the CTD casts within the ESB. The blue dashed line marks the approximate depth of the 21?C\nisotherm in a hypothetical scenario without the BC.\n\n\n\n28\n\nwater with dye concentration equal to or greater than 70 kg m?3, divided by the\n\nlocal depth.\n\nFigure 2.6 shows that slope water tends to penetrate the shelf mostly within\n\nthe TB area, in agreement with the qualitative picture suggested by the observa-\n\ntions. This intrusion area is active under all forcing scenarios (wind\u2013only, BC\u2013only\n\nand wind+BC), although clearly only wind forcing is capable of driving slope wa-\n\nter all the way to the inner shelf. The rough topography scenarios show more\n\nirregular distributions, although the overall spatial patterns are similar to those\n\nin their smooth topography counterparts. We therefore discuss only the smooth\n\ntopography experiments in the following sections. However, there seems to be an\n\nadditional intrusion spot on the southern flank of the AB, which is more evident\n\nin the wind\u2013driven rough topography scenarios (Figure 2.6b,d). This suggests\n\nthat some kind of local mean flow\u2013topography interaction process could be rele-\n\nvant there, in addition to the tide\u2013topography interaction mechanisms suggested\n\nby Pereira et al. (2005).\n\nUnlike the wind\u2013driven intrusions, the BC\u2013driven intrusions occupy the en-\n\ntire water column, and are therefore likely to cause TW to penetrate the outer\n\nshelf along with the SACW in certain parts of the TB area. This point is demon-\n\nstrated by the slope water layer thickness distributions in the BC\u2013only scenarios,\n\nwhich are equal to the local depth near the shelfbreak (Figure 2.6e,f). In contrast,\n\nthe wind\u2013driven experiments show bottom\u2013intensified SACW intrusions farther\n\nonshore on the TB shelf, followed by a top\u2013bottom slope water layer within the\n\ncoastal upwelling plume (Figure 2.6a,b,c,d).\n\nVelocity and temperature distributions\n\nThe surface and near\u2013bottom temperature and velocity distributions from both\n\nEXP\u2013smoo\u20131 (wind\u2013only) and EXP\u2013smoo\u20133 (wind+BC) show minor differences\n\n(Figure 2.7, upper and middle rows). Both realistically reproduce the shape of\n\nthe coastal upwelling plume, as noted by their similarity with the observed cli-\n\nmatological SST pattern (Figure 2.5a). The primary difference is that EXP\u2013smoo\u20133\n\n\n\n29\n\nFigure 2.6: Instantaneous maps of the thickness of the layer occupied by intruded water on\nthe shelf. In red areas, the entire water column is occupied by water that was located offshore of\nthe 70 m isobath (approximately the shelfbreak depth) in the initial conditions. In blue areas, no\nwater originally offshore of the shelfbreak is present. (a,c,e): Smooth topography experiments.\n(b,d,f): Rough topography experiments. (a,b): Wind\u2013only experiments. (c,d): Wind + Brazil\nCurrent experiments. (e,f): Brazil Current\u2013only experiments. In the wind\u2013forced experiments\n(a,b,c,d) the instantaneous fields are shown for model day 8.2, near the end of the spinup of the\nshelf circulation. In the BC\u2013only experiments (e,f), the instantaneous fields are shown for the last\nmodel day (29.6), because the features in the dye fields take longer to develop. The thick gray\nlines represent the 70 m and 1000 m isobaths.\n\n\n\n30\n\nproduces colder SACW intrusions.\n\nThe near\u2013bottom temperature and velocity distributions from the simplified\n\nexperiments reveal two major pathways of SACW intrusion within the TB and one\n\nin the southern flank of the AB (Figure 2.7b,d). The realistic Hybrid Coordinate\n\nOcean Model (HYCOM) simulation has a coarser horizontal resolution (?4.5 km)\n\nthan the simplified ROMS experiments, and therefore is not expected to represent\n\nthe coastal circulation as well as the deep\u2013ocean circulation5. Despite this limita-\n\ntion, some snapshots from the realistic simulation do represent similar intrusion\n\npathways (e.g., Figure 2.7f).\n\nThe model temperature and cross\u2013isobath velocity vertical structures along\n\nthe TB shelfbreak are consistent with the dye distributions, in that the onshore\n\nflow occupies the lower half of the water column in the wind\u2013driven scenar-\n\nios, but spreads throughout the water column and is surface\u2013intensified in EXP\u2013\n\nsmoo\u20132 (BC\u2013only, Figures 2.8 and 2.9). This again suggests that standard cross\u2013\n\nshelf surface Ekman transport divergence may be the lowest order mechanism\n\nresponsible for the SACW intrusions in the TB. The maximum onshore velocity\n\nis ?9 cm s?1 and ?7 cm s?1 in EXP\u2013smoo\u20133 and EXP\u2013smoo\u20131, respectively, but\n\nonly ?2 cm s?1 in the EXP\u2013smoo\u20132. In both wind\u2013driven scenarios, the max-\n\nimum onshore velocity is not found near the bottom, as classic, homogeneous\n\nEkman Theory suggests. Rather, it is found at mid\u2013depth (?30\u201340 m), consis-\n\ntent with the theoretical predictions of Lentz &amp; Chapman (2004) for the parameter\n\nrange S ? ?N/f ? 1 (S ? 1 in the estimates for the most strongly stratified cases\n\nobserved in the TB, see Table 2.2). In the theory of Lentz &amp; Chapman (2004), this\n\nmid\u2013depth intensification of onshore flow is linked to the divergence of nonlinear\n\ncross\u2013isobath momentum advection. Besides this mechanism, local acceleration\n\nor an along\u2013isobath pressure gradient force can also produce an additional on-\n\nshore return flow.\n\nThe maximum onshore velocity is located at the narrowest part of the shelf\n\n(?20?S). It is there that the thermocline is shallowest in both wind\u2013driven scenar-\n\nios, where water as cold as 22?C and 19.5?C is found in EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 (wind\u2013only)\n\n5details on the model verification are found in Arruda et al. (2013).\n\n\n\n31\n\nand EXP\u2013smoo\u20133 (wind+BC), respectively. This difference also suggests that the\n\neffect of thermocline uplifting by the BC is important in modifying the source\n\nwater temperature, causing colder branches of SACW to enter the shelf.\n\nAnother point worth stressing is the qualitative similarity between the cross\u2013\n\nisobath velocity sections in both wind\u2013driven scenarios. The local maxima and\n\nminima in the EXP\u2013smoo\u20133 scenario (wind+BC) seems to be very similar to the\n\nsum of the EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 (wind\u2013only) and EXP\u2013smoo\u20132 (BC\u2013only) scenarios (Fig-\n\nure 2.8). In fact, the normalized root mean square difference between EXP\u2013smoo\u2013\n\n3 and the sum of EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 and EXP\u2013smoo\u20132 is only 7.8 %. This indicates that,\n\nin the shelfbreak area, the total model cross\u2013isobath circulation is almost a linear\n\ncombination of the individual effects of the wind and BC forcings.\n\nThe cross\u2013shelf temperature distributions further stress the depth\u2013dependent\n\ncharacter of the SACW intrusions within the TB. For both wind\u2013driven scenarios,\n\nthe three cross\u2013shelf lines in Figure 2.9 show different regimes. The southernmost\n\nline reflects the well\u2013mixed character of the shelf and the offshore displacement\n\nof the coastal upwelling plume all the way to the shelf edge (Figure 2.9a,d). The\n\nmiddle line is located at the narrowest part of the shelf, where the maximum on-\n\nshore velocity is found, and where the thermocline is shallowest (Figure 2.8a,b).\n\nIn this area, a mature coastal upwelling plume is found at ?8 km from the coast\n\n(Figure 2.9b,e). The northernmost line reveals a clear bottom\u2013trapped temper-\n\nature front, but no coastal upwelling plume. The intrusions in EXP\u2013smoo\u20132\n\n(BC\u2013only) are also consistent with the interpretation suggested by the dye dis-\n\ntributions. No upwelling plume develops, and the uplift of the isotherms in the\n\nbottom\u2013trapped temperature front is much gentler than in the wind-driven sce-\n\nnarios (Figure 2.9g,h,i).\n\n2.5 Along\u2013isobath momentum balance\n\nAt this point we have presented evidence that SACW tends to enter the ESB shelf\n\nat preferential along\u2013shelf locations. But what are the physical mechanisms in-\n\nvolved? We begin to address this question by examining the momentum budget\n\n\n\n32\n\nFigure 2.7: Instantaneous temperature (color shading) and velocity (vectors) at the surface and\nnear the bottom.

(2009). In this\n\nnew coordinate system, y?? (x??) is the along\u2013isobath (cross\u2013isobath) direction. y??\n\n(x??) is positive equatorward (offshore). The rationale for using this transformed\n\nframework of reference is that it is a more exact approach to the study of flows\n\nthat deviate from geostrophy and transport mass across isobaths, breaking the\n\nTaylor\u2013Proudman constraint. The along\u2013isobath component of the momentum\n\nbudget, with pressure in kinematic units (i.e., divided by the Boussinesq reference\n\n\n\n34\n\nFigure 2.9: Run\u2013averaged potential temperature along three cross\u2013shelf lines for the smooth\ntopography experiments.

The along\u2013isobath momen-\n\ntum balance relates directly to the cross\u2013isobath circulation, and geostrophy was\n\nfound to dominate the cross\u2013isobath momentum balance in all experiments, as\n\nconsistently supported by observational evidence for the subtidal mean flow on\n\n\n\n35\n\nmost continental shelves (e.g., Lentz &amp; Chapman, 2004, and references therein).\n\nFor these reasons, only the along\u2013isobath momentum balance is discussed here.\n\nIn addition, due to the similarity between the wind+BC experiment (EXP\u2013smoo\u2013\n\n3) and the wind\u2013only experiment (EXP\u2013smoo\u20131), we restrict ourselves to com-\n\nparing results from the wind\u2013only (EXP\u2013smoo\u20131) and BC\u2013only (EXP\u2013smoo\u20132)\n\nexperiments.\n\nAlong the 70 m isobath (approximately the shelfbreak depth), there are areas\n\nwhere PGFy? is positive (i.e., equatorward, Figure 2.10). Part of this equatorward\n\nPGFy? gives rise to a geostrophically\u2013balanced onshore flow, which has been\n\nfound to be an important source of onshore transport in many continental shelves\n\n(e.g., Scott &amp; Csanady, 1976; Palma &amp; Matano, 2009; Pringle &amp; Dever, 2009; Gan et al.,\n\n2009, 2013; Xu et al., 2015; McCabe et al., 2015). The PGFy? is surface\u2013intensified\n\nin both EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 (wind\u2013only) and EXP\u2013smoo\u20132 (BC\u2013only), and tends to not\n\nchange sign vertically. The EXP\u2013smoo\u20132 scenario features a more clearly periodic\n\npattern, with alternating areas of equatorward PGFy? (onshore geostrophic flow)\n\nand poleward PGFy? (offshore geostrophic flow). Finally, the amplitude of the\n\nPGFy? in EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 is greater than the amplitude of the PGFy? in EXP\u2013smoo\u20132\n\nby a factor of ?3. This proportion is similar to the proportion between onshore\n\nvelocities across the shelfbreak (Figure 2.8a,b).\n\nThe spatial patterns of the individual momentum advection terms\n(\nu ?v\n?x?, v\n\n?v\n?y?\n\nand w?v\n?z\n\n)\nare qualitatively similar and nearly balance each other (not shown),\n\nleaving a net momentum advection NLy? that is O(10?6) m s?2 or smaller. In\n\nall experiments, the local acceleration (ACCELy?) and horizontal viscosity terms\n\n(HVISy?) are everywhere O(10?7) m s?2 or smaller, which is at least one order of\n\nmagnitude smaller than the next\u2013largest terms.\n\nTo close the momentum budget, it is helpful to examine the part of the PGFy?\n\nthat is left unbalanced by the Coriolis acceleration, i.e., AGEOy? ? ? ?p?y? ? fu.\n\nWithin the geostrophic interior, this ageostrophic pressure gradient force is ap-\n\nproximately balanced by net nonlinear momentum advection NLy? (Figure 2.11).\n\n\n\n36\n\nTherefore, away from the Ekman layers, the simplified momentum balance is\n\nfu ??\n?p\n\n?y?\n? NLy?, (2.2)\n\nor geostrophic balance modified by net momentum advection. Considering the\n\nwind\u2013driven case, the combination of this result with the mid\u2013depth position of\n\nthe maximum onshore return flow (Figure 2.8a) alludes to the dynamical regime\n\npredicted by Lentz &amp; Chapman (2004) under strong stratification. Within the bot-\n\ntom Ekman layer, AGEOy? is approximately balanced by the vertical viscosity\n\nVVISy? (Figure 2.12). The simplified momentum balance within the bottom Ek-\n\nman layer is then\n\nfu ??\n?p\n\n?y?\n+\n\n?\n\n?z\n\n(\nAV\n\n?v\n\n?z\n\n)\n, (2.3)\n\nor an Ekman\u2013like balance modified by the PGFy?. This leading\u2013order balance in\n\nthe bottom Ekman layer has been found in other studies (e.g., Palma et al., 2008;\n\nPalma &amp; Matano, 2009). The surface Ekman layer (in the wind\u2013driven scenarios)\n\nappears to have a more complicated balance, requiring both NLy? and PGFy? to\n\ncompensate the residue of the Ekman balance (not shown).\n\nThe picture that emerges from this model analysis is that of an energetic,\n\ngeostrophic leading\u2013order cross\u2013isobath circulation at the shelf edge. The non\u2013\n\nnegligible PGFy? at the shelf edge is consistent with the predictions from Clarke\n\n&amp; Brink (1985) for the observed values of the slope Burger number (Table 2.2). At\n\nnext order, nonlinear effects and bottom stress seem to be important.\n\n2.5.2 Depth\u2013averaged momentum balance\n\nA question now worth examining is what are the leading\u2013order momentum and\n\nmass balances in a depth\u2013averaged sense. Neglecting the highest\u2013order terms\n\n(local acceleration and horizontal viscosity), the depth\u2013averaged, along\u2013isobath\n\nmomentum balance with stresses in kinematic units (i.e., divided by the Boussi-\n\n\n\n37\n\nFigure 2.10: Run\u2013averaged along\u2013isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) along the 70 m iso-\nbath for the smooth topography scenarios.

Fig-\n\nure 2.13 shows that in areas of onshore flow the water column is approximately in\n\n\n\n38\n\nFigure 2.11: Run\u2013averaged along\u2013isobath residue between the along\u2013isobath ageostrophic\npressure gradient force (AGEOy?) and the net momentum advection term (NLy?).

Momentum advection is the\n\nnext\u2013largest term, and is particularly important in the north of the TB (?20.5?S\u2013\n\n19.5?S) in EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 (wind\u2013only), as the depth\u2013dependent momentum bal-\n\nance suggests (Figure 2.11a). In both EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 and EXP\u2013smoo\u20132 (BC\u2013only)\n\nscenarios, bottom stress is the smallest of the terms considered. Part of the rela-\n\ntive ineffectiveness of the bottom Ekman transport along the shelfbreak may be\n\ndue to buoyancy arrest (see Section 2.4.1). The ratio ?by?/?sy? in the wind\u2013only\n\nexperiment is 0.12 or smaller, indicating that, along the shelf edge, the offshore\n\ntransport in the surface Ekman layer is at least 9\u201310 times larger than the on-\n\nshore transport in the bottom Ekman layer. Inshore of the shelfbreak, the median\n\n(maximum) of this ratio at the location of maximum onshore flow is 0.37 (0.67),\n\nshowing that the contribution of the bottom Ekman transport to the mass balance\n\nincreases toward the coast. This range of ?by?/?sy? values agrees with estimates\n\nderived from observations in different coastal upwelling systems (Lentz &amp; Chap-\n\n\n\n39\n\nFigure 2.12: Run\u2013averaged along\u2013isobath residue between the along\u2013isobath ageostrophic\npressure gradient force (AGEOy?) and the vertical viscosity term (VVISy?).

In\n\nthe wind\u2013driven scenarios (EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 and EXP\u2013smoo\u20133) the wind stress is\n\nalso important at leading order. Simplifying Equation 2.4 using this result, and\n\nmultiplying it through by H/f yields\n\nUH =\n?sy?\n\nf\n?\nH\n\nf\nPy? ?\n\nH\n\nf\nNLy?. (2.5)\n\nThis can be seen as a form of the parallel transport model (Csanady, 1982). The\n\nphysical content of Equation 2.5 is that the net cross\u2013isobath volume transport per\n\nunit length (in the along\u2013isobath direction) is a balance between offshore surface\n\nEkman transport and onshore geostrophic transport induced by the equatorward\n\nPGFy? throughout the water column (with a smaller contribution from momen-\n\n\n\n40\n\ntum advection), as shown in the previous section. This depth\u2013averaged analysis\n\nconfirms that the leading\u2013order balance is geostrophic\u2013like under the three forc-\n\ning scenarios, especially in the BC\u2013only case (EXP\u2013smoo\u20132, Figure 2.13b). More-\n\nover, the previous conjectures on the importance of the model nonlinear cross\u2013\n\nisobath momentum advection (Lentz &amp; Chapman, 2004) are also confirmed.\n\nThe realistic HYCOM solution reveals encouraging similarities with the sim-\n\nplified ROMS solutions. Specifically, the time\u2013mean, depth\u2013averaged flow across\n\nthe shelfbreak is partly in geostrophic balance, and is onshore at the same pref-\n\nerential intrusion locations suggested by the results presented previously (blue\n\nshaded areas in Figure 2.14). In the areas where the PGFy? is equatorward (i.e.,\n\npreferential intrusion sites), its magnitude is ? 2\u20133\u00d710?6 m s?2. This magnitude\n\nis comparable to the values obtained in the simplified experiments (Figure 2.13).\n\nThe onshore velocities in the realistic experiment (simplified experiments) are\n\ntypically 3\u20135 cm s?1 (1\u20134 cm s?1).\n\nThe net transport across the TB shelf in the realistic experiment (EXP\u2013smoo\u20133\n\nexperiment) is -0.13 Sv (-0.05 Sv). The difference is certainly in part due to the\n\ncontribution of more energetic BC frontal eddies in the realistic experiment (see\n\nArruda et al., 2013 for details), since the BC sought in the simplified experiments is\n\nmeant to represent a hypothetical state of the current with minimal eddy kinetic\n\nenergy, i.e., least mesoscale activity.\n\nHorizontal patterns\n\nAfter having examined the momentum budget along the shelf edge, a relevant\n\nquestion is: Is the equatorward PGFy? also the primary forcing of the model in-\n\ntrusions inshore of the shelfbreak? To answer this, we examine the spatial distri-\n\nbution of the PGFy? and the along\u2013isobath Coriolis acceleration in the simplified\n\nexperiments.\n\nThe onshore depth\u2013averaged flow extends over large areas of the shelf in both\n\nEXP\u2013smoo\u20131 (wind\u2013only) and EXP\u2013smoo\u20132 (BC\u2013only) cases (Figure 2.15). These\n\nareas are consistent with the preferential intrusion sites discussed previously. The\n\n\n\n41\n\nFigure 2.13: Run\u2013averaged and depth\u2013averaged momentum balance terms in the along\u2013\nisobath direction along the 70 m isobath.

The blue shading marks areas of onshore flow (U &lt;0), which are indicated by the blue\narrows on the map insert. The vertical lines labelled 1\u20135 indicate along\u2013isobath locations, which\ncorrespond to the numbered dots on the map insert.\n\nequatorward PGFy? is partly balanced by the Coriolis acceleration, producing an\n\nonshore geostrophic flow. We also point out that the areas of onshore flow are\n\nroughly the same in both scenarios, once again suggesting that the effects of both\n\nforcings favor the SACW intrusions (Figure 2.15b,d), underneath the surface Ek-\n\nman layer. The normalized root mean square difference between EXP\u2013smoo\u20133\n\n(wind+BC) and the sum of EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 and EXP\u2013smoo\u20132 is 2.7 % and 4.8 % for\n\nthe ?Py? and ?fU fields, respectively.\n\nOther studies have shown that preferential locations for offshore water in-\n\ntrusions and coastal upwelling may be associated with the combined effects of a\n\nwestern boundary current, upwelling\u2013favorable winds and shelf geometry. Specif-\n\nically, Palma &amp; Matano (2009) show that a large area of geostrophically\u2013balanced\n\nequatorward PGFy? forms in their numerical experiments in the South Brazil\n\nBight area (22?S\u201328.5?S), producing onshore flow. At the south end of this re-\n\ngion, Campos et al. (2013) show that the combination of intermittent upwelling\u2013\n\n\n\n42\n\nFigure 2.14: Time\u2013averaged (2004\u20132009) and depth\u2013averaged distributions of along\u2013isobath\npressure gradient force per unit mass (?Py?), Coriolis acceleration (?fU) and cross\u2013isobath ve-\nlocity (U) along the 70 m isobath for the realistic experiment. The blue shading marks areas of\nonshore flow (U &lt;0), which are indicated by the blue arrows in the map insert. The vertical lines\nlabelled 1\u20135 indicate along\u2013isobath locations, which correspond to the numbered dots on the map\ninsert.\n\nfavorable winds and the BC\u2013related PGFy? is a plausible explanation for the ob-\n\nserved prevalence of coastal upwelling off a particular location around Cape\n\nSanta Marta (28.5?S). In addition, the cape geometry also has an important local\n\neffect in producing vertical transport through flow\u2013topography interaction mech-\n\nanisms (Mazzini &amp; Barth, 2013). The ESB area also features dramatic along\u2013shelf\n\nchanges in shelf geometry and coastline orientation, which have been shown to\n\nbe important on a smaller scale by Mazzini &amp; Barth (2013). The present study sug-\n\ngests conclusions consistent with this perspective, as both the wind and the BC\n\nforcings add up to produce onshore motion at the preferential locations indicated\n\nby the blue arrows in Figure 2.15.\n\nOne of the effects related to along\u2013shelf geometric changes is that onshore\n\ntransport is expected to be enhanced in regions where the shelf narrows in the\n\ndirection that long Coastal Trapped Waves (CTWs) propagate (Pringle, 2002). The\n\ndownwave direction in the present case is equatorward, and therefore it could be\n\n\n\n43\n\nasked whether the sharp change in shelf width at ?22?S has any effect on the pres-\n\nsure (and flow) field at the north end of the ESB (?19.5?S). As shown by Pringle\n\n(2002), the scale of influence Lfric of a geometric perturbation in the downwave\n\ndirection (in the barotropic and linear limits) is predicted to be Lfric = (fH2)/(?r),\n\nwhere H is the local depth and f, ? and r are typical absolute values for the Cori-\n\nolis parameter, bottom slope and a linear bottom friction coefficient. Plugging in\n\nrepresentative values6 for the TB yields Lfric = 360 km at the 70 m isobath. This is\n\nlonger than the along\u2013shelf extension of the TB (Figure 2.1). Therefore, we argue\n\nthat this effect could remotely set up part of the PGFy? found in the the wind\u2013\n\ndriven experiments, and therefore enhance SACW intrusions within the TB.\n\n2.6 Deep\u2013ocean forcing mechanisms\n\nIn this section, we attempt to isolate some of the deep\u2013ocean physical processes\n\ninvolved in the SACW intrusions. We begin by quantifying the change in the up-\n\nwelling source water caused by the thermal wind signal of the BC. Next, we\n\ninvestigate the shelf encroaching of the BC by inertial overshooting. Finally, we\n\nexamine the along\u2013shelf pressure gradient associated with the planetary ?\u2013effect\n\nwith a simple analytical model.\n\n2.6.1 Pycnocline uplifting linked to the Brazil Current mean jet\n\nPerhaps the simplest mechanism through which a boundary current can influ-\n\nence coastal and shelfbreak upwelling is by changing the properties of the water\n\navailable at the shelf edge. This is just a consequence of the fact that the current\n\nis in thermal wind balance, and therefore the pycnocline has to be either deeper\n\nor shallower (as in the present case) relative to its depth in the Sverdrup interior.\n\nWe quantified the change in the upwelling source water induced by the BC\n\nuplifting by comparing the minimum SST histories on the TB shelf in the sim-\n\nplified model experiments. Figure 2.16a shows that both wind\u2013driven scenarios\n\n6f = 5.1 \u00d7 10?5 s?1, ? = 2.3 \u00d7 10?3 and r = 3.0 \u00d7 10?4 m s?1.\n\n\n\n44\n\nFigure 2.15: Horizontal distribution of run\u2013averaged and depth\u2013averaged along\u2013isobath pres-\nsure gradient force per unit mass (?Py?, a,c) and Coriolis acceleration (?fU, b,d) for the smooth\ntopography scenarios.

The blue arrows on the right column indicate preferential\npathways of onshore flow.\n\nundergo a spinup phase and attain a quasi\u2013steady minimum shelf SST. In EXP\u2013\n\nsmoo\u20133 (wind+BC), however, the minimum SST is ?1.4 ?C colder than in EXP\u2013\n\nsmoo\u20131 (wind\u2013only). As wind forcing has been shown to dominate the flow on\n\nthe entire model shelf, we argue that the change in SST is mostly a consequence\n\nof the uplifting of colder isotherms due to the presence of the BC along the shelf\n\nedge.\n\nFigure 2.16b shows the evolution of the intruded water volume on the TB shelf\n\nfor the simplified experiments. This was measured by calculating the total vol-\n\nume instantaneously occupied by offshore water within a control volume of 1245\n\n\n\n45\n\nkm3 in the TB shelf7. Surprisingly, the mean onshore transport in EXP\u2013smoo\u20133 is\n\n0.10 Sv, 30 % smaller than in EXP\u2013smoo\u20131. Consequently, the mean flushing time\n\n? is also shorter in EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 (97 days). In the wind\u2013driven experiments with\n\nrealistic topography ? is ?50\u201360 days (not shown).\n\nIt can be seen that intruded water (mostly SACW) eventually occupies ?25 %\n\nof the TB shelf volume, considering a typical volume of 300 km3 of intruded water\n\non the shelf (Figure 2.16b). South of the ESB, in the northern South Brazil Bight,\n\nSACW has been estimated to occupy a larger fraction of the total shelf volume\n\n(37\u201356 %, Cerda &amp; Castro, 2014).\n\nWe conclude from the present analyses that the amount of intruded water in\n\nEXP\u2013smoo\u20133 (wind+BC) is slightly smaller than in EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 (wind\u2013only), but\n\nthe minimum SST on the shelf is colder. In other words, total mass exchange is\n\nslightly smaller when the BC is present, but the additional uplift of the thermo-\n\ncline causes the upwelling source water to be colder.\n\n2.6.2 Shelf encroaching of the Brazil Current by inertial over-\n\nshooting\n\nWhen flow in exact geostrophic balance encounters a change in bottom topogra-\n\nphy, its ability to continue to follow isobaths depends on its amount of inertia.\n\nAs it flows along the ESB shelfbreak, the BC is expected to locally overshoot it in\n\nsome areas, thereby advecting SACW and TW onto the outer part of the continental\n\nshelf.\n\nThis effect is expected to be more important where the curvature R?1 of the\n\nisobaths is large enough to cause the centrifugal acceleration V 2/R experienced\n\nby a water parcel moving with an along\u2013isobath velocity V to become compara-\n\nble to the Coriolis acceleration fV . The ratio\n\nRocurv =\nV\n\nfR\n(2.6)\n\n7See Section 2.4.2 for an explanation on the initialization and interpretation of the passive\ntracer (dye) fields in the simplified experiments.\n\n\n\n46\n\nFigure 2.16: Model histories showing the effect of pycnocline uplifting by the BC. (a): Com-\nparison of the model minimum shelf SST histories (on the TB area) for EXP\u2013smoo\u20131 (wind\u2013only),\nEXP\u2013smoo\u20132 (BC\u2013only) and EXP\u2013smoo\u20133 (wind+BC) experiments. The black dashed line indi-\ncates the observed climatological minimum SST (see Figure 2.5a). (b): Comparison of the model\nshelf\u2013averaged intruded dye volume histories (on the TB area) for the same experiments. The\ndashed lines are linear least\u2013squares fits, and their slopes represent the mean onshore transport\nof slope water onto the shelf under each forcing scenario. ? indicates the mean flushing time of\nthe shelf control volume, based on the slope of the linear fits. The negligible signal of the un-\nforced scenario (solid black line) is a model sensitivity test, whose flow field is exclusively due to\nnumerical horizontal pressure gradient errors.\n\n\n\n47\n\ncan therefore be defined to measure the importance of the contribution of curva-\n\nture effects. Figure 2.17 shows Rocurv along the 100 m isobath in EXP\u2013smoo\u20132 as\n\na function of latitude. The mean (maximum) value of Rocurv is 0.02 (0.18), and the\n\nlocal maxima coincide with the areas of maximum isobath curvature. Away from\n\nthe maxima, Rocurv is everywhere smaller than 0.05. The smallness of Rocurv re-\n\nflects the relatively weak mean along\u2013isobath flow represented by EXP\u2013smoo\u20132,\n\nwhich is everywhere slower than 26 cm s?1. If a typical synoptic along\u2013isobath\n\nvelocity of 0.6 m s?1 is considered instead (as observed during the OCT12 survey,\n\nFigure 2.18a,c), the mean (maximum) Rocurv increases to 0.11 (0.51). Curvature ef-\n\nfects are therefore more relevant in the south and north ends of the TB, especially\n\nwhen the incoming BC jet is most energetic.\n\nAreas of high relative vorticity ? clearly exist along the TB shelf edge, and a\n\nconvenient measure of the relative importance of the total (curvature + shear)\n\nnonlinear effects is given by the quantity Ro = |?/f| (Figure 2.18). It is seen\n\nthat both the time\u2013mean realistic model fields and direct velocity observations\n\nindicate typical (maximum) values of Ro of ?0.3 (?0.5), spreading over large\n\nareas of the TB slope and shelf edge. Therefore it seems that it is horizontal shear\n\n(rather than the more localized and episodic curvature effects) that account for\n\nthe bulk of the nonlinearities at the shelf edge in a time\u2013mean sense.\n\nThe Kuroshio is perhaps one of the best documented examples of the iner-\n\ntial overshooting process (e.g., Hsueh et al., 1996; Ve?lez-Belch?? et al., 2013), with\n\nRo ? 0.5 (Brink, 1998). The size of Ro estimated in the present analyses therefore\n\npredicts shelf encroaching to be locally important along the shelf edge of the TB.\n\nOff southeast Australia, encroaching of the East Australian Current (EAC) has\n\nbeen shown to occasionally precondition the water mass field on the shelf with\n\ncolder offshore water, which may in turn reach the coast under the influence of\n\npersistent upwelling\u2013favorable winds. This interaction has been shown to cause\n\nmore intense coastal upwelling events than the ones observed without encroach-\n\ning or other favorable EAC\u2013related processes (e.g., Gibbs et al., 1998; Roughan &amp;\n\nMiddleton, 2002; Schaeffer et al., 2013). Events when the BC is more energetic are\n\n\n\n48\n\nthus probably associated with stronger shelf encroaching, and therefore more sig-\n\nnificant preconditioning of the shelf water mass structure to wind\u2013driven up-\n\nwelling.\n\nFigure 2.17: Distributions of model velocity (run\u2013averaged and depth\u2013averaged in the upper\n100 m) and centrifugal acceleration normalized by the Coriolis acceleration, Rocurv = V/(fR).

The red arrows indicate areas of large curva-\nture effects, which are found mostly where the along\u2013isobath flow encounters sharp changes in\nisobath orientation.\n\n2.6.3 Meridional pressure gradient induced by the ? effect\n\nAlthough safely neglected in models of coastal circulation where the f\u2013plane ap-\n\nproximation is valid, the planetary ?\u2013effect is perhaps an overlooked mechanism\n\nin the context of shelfbreak upwelling. In the following we examine the merid-\n\nional (i.e., along\u2013shelf) pressure gradient force PGF?y induced by the planetary\n\n?\u2013effect. We employ a single\u2013layer reduced gravity model8 as in Charney (1955).\n\nThe dynamically active (upper) layer (Figure 2.19) is assumed to be in geostrophic\n\nbalance, i.e.,\n\n?fv = ?g?hx, (2.7)\n8Also referred to in the literature as a 1.5\u2013layer equivalent\u2013barotropic model.\n\n\n\n49\n\nFigure 2.18: Distributions of model velocity and relative vorticity normalized by the local in-\nertial frequency, Ro= |?/f|, demonstrating the proneness of shelf edge locations to the effect of\nshelf encroaching of the BC. (a,b,c,d): Examples of observation\u2013derived cross\u2013transect velocity\n(a,c) and Ro (b,d) along two transects occupied in the OCT12 survey. The red lines on the map\ninserts indicate the location of the transects. (e): 2004\u20132009 average of depth\u2013averaged (within\nthe upper 300 m) velocity (white streamlines) and Ro (color shading) from the realistic HYCOM\nsimulation. the gray lines are the 30 m and 200 m isobaths. The arrows indicate areas of large\nrelative vorticity, located mostly around the shelf edge, following the inshore lobe of the BC jet.\n\n\n\n50\n\nwhere f is the Coriolis parameter, v is the along\u2013shelf velocity, h is the upper layer\n\nthickness and g? ? g(?2 ??1)/?2 is a reduced gravity based on the total accelera-\n\ntion due to gravity g and the densities of the upper (?1) and lower (?2) layers. The\n\nsubscript x indicates partial differentiation in the cross\u2013shelf direction. Multiply-\n\ning Equation 2.7 by h and integrating from the shelf edge (x = xc) to the offshore\n\nlimit of the western boundary layer (x = xo) gives\n\n? xo\nxc\n\nhv dx =\ng?\n\nf\n\n? xo\nxc\n\nhxhdx. (2.8)\n\nThe left\u2013hand side of Equation 2.8 is the total along\u2013shelf volume transport Q in\n\nthe upper layer. Manipulating the right\u2013hand side using the product rule yields\n\nQ =\ng?\n\nf\n\n? xo\nxc\n\n(h2/2)x dx, (2.9)\n\nor, in terms of the thermocline depths at the outer limit of the BC (ho) and at the\n\nshelf edge (hc),\n\nQ =\ng?\n\n2f\n(h2o ?h\n\n2\nc). (2.10)\n\nEquation 2.10 establishes a relationship between the along\u2013shelf transport of the\n\nBC and how much it uplifts the thermocline in the cross\u2013shelf direction. Solving\n\nEquation 2.10 for hc gives\n\nh2c = h\n2\no ?\n\n2fQ\n\ng?\n. (2.11)\n\nLet us now seek a crude estimate of the along\u2013shelf pressure gradient force\n\nat the shelf edge (PGF?y ) caused in response to this effect. We assume that the\n\nBC jet conserves mass (Q = constant) between two along\u2013shelf locations ynorth =\n\n19?S and ysouth = 22?S, and that the offshore thermocline depth ho does not vary\n\nbetween those locations. Plugging approximate values for Q, g?, ho, fnorth and\n\nfsouth in Equation 2.11 yields\n\n(hc)north ? (hc)south ??8 m, (2.12)\n\n\n\n51\n\nthat is, the thermocline is predicted to be ?8 m shallower in the north end of\n\nthe TB shelf, which is consistent with the existence of a northward PGF?y and an\n\nonshore geostrophic flow across the shelf edge. We may use Equation 2.12 to\n\nestimate the magnitude of this force:\n\nPGF?y = ?g\n?\n[\n\n(hc)north ? (hc)south\nynorth ?ysouth\n\n]\n= 5.6 \u00d7 10?7m s?2. (2.13)\n\nThis acceleration is comparable to the total pressure gradient force per unit mass\n\nmodeled in the BC\u2013only scenario (Figure 2.13b). It drives an onshore depth\u2013\n\naveraged geostrophic velocity PGF?y/f of ??1 cm s?1.\n\nAn evaluation of the accuracy of the estimate in Equation 2.12 and the as-\n\nsumption that ho does not vary in the along\u2013shelf direction is desirable. To achieve\n\nthis, we examined the thermocline depth distribution derived from the annual\n\nWOA13 objectively\u2013analyzed (OA) Temperature (T) and Salinity (S) fields. The re-\n\nsult does show an ?10 m shallower thermocline at 19.5?S relatively to 21?S (Fig-\n\nure 2.20a). We point out, however, that an accuracy estimate for this dataset is\n\nnot straightforward in this case. This is because the objective analysis technique\n\nused to produce the WOA13 fields does not provide information on the spatial dis-\n\ntribution of the variance of the interpolation error, unlike other objective analysis\n\ntechniques commonly employed in the spatial mapping of oceanographic vari-\n\nables (e.g., Bretherton et al., 1976). In the WOA13 case, the standard error about\n\nthe statistical mean and the difference between the OA fields and the statistical\n\nmean fields (OA?X) are the natural measures of uncertainty. However, the anal-\n\nysis of the thermocline depth distribution derived from the statistical mean fields\n\nof T and S gives rise to another problem. The number of T and S observations\n\nper 0.25?square is so small in the ESB (Figure 2.20b) that the thermocline depth\n\ndistribution derived from the statistical mean (and hence the OA?X map) is ex-\n\ncessively patchy (not shown). Due to its statistical limitations, we consider the\n\nOA WOA13 fields only as a suggestive experimental verification of the PGF?y .\n\n\n\n52\n\nFigure 2.19: Schematic representation of a single\u2013layer reduced gravity model for the BC.

We employ a combination of realistic and simpli-\n\nfied numerical experiments and an analysis of available observations to examine\n\nthe effects of bottom topography, wind\u2013driving and the Brazil Current (BC). A\n\nschematic overview of our findings is presented in Figure 2.21.\n\nSACW appears to enter the model shelf through preferential pathways which\n\ncoincide with along\u2013shelf locations where a geostrophically\u2013balanced equator-\n\nward (i.e., intrusion\u2013favorable) along\u2013isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) ex-\n\nists, as consistently suggested by the simplified and realistic numerical experi-\n\nments. The geostrophic balance in the along\u2013isobath direction is modified by\n\nmomentum advection at mid\u2013depth and by friction in the bottom Ekman layer.\n\nBoth wind\u2013 and BC\u2013forced scenarios are found to produce an equatorward PGFy?.\n\nHowever, the BC\u2013induced PGFy? is about half as intense as its wind\u2013induced\n\ncounterpart (which is ? 2 \u00d7 10?6 m s?2), and has a periodic along\u2013shelf pat-\n\ntern, alternating areas of onshore and offshore geostrophic flow. The net effect\n\nis an equatorward PGFy? throughout most of the TB, with local maxima at the\n\npreferential intrusion sites.\n\nTypical magnitudes of the model time\u2013mean, depth\u2013averaged onshore veloc-\n\nities are 1\u20135 cm s?1. The dominance of the model onshore geostrophic flow ex-\n\ntends beyond the shelf edge area, apparently contributing to the SACW transport\n\nalso on the shelf proper. Estimates of the slope Burger number from the five avail-\n\nable hydrographic datasets yield values between 0.32 and 0.92. The associated\n\nbuoyancy arrest time scales suggest that the system might be more likely to expe-\n\nrience buoyancy arrest during vigorous SACW intrusions. The vertical structure of\n\nthe onshore velocity at the shelf edge is consistent with theoretical predictions for\n\nS = O(1), suggesting the interpretation that the cross\u2013isobath velocity structure\n\nin the TB is modulated by the intensity of the SACW intrusions.\n\n\n\n55\n\nWind forcing alone is both required and sufficient to reproduce the main fea-\n\ntures of coastal upwelling in the TB. Among the next\u2013order effects, the uplifting of\n\nthe thermocline by the BC results in the outcropping of water ?1.4?C colder under\n\nsteady, upwelling\u2013favorable wind forcing (compared to a flat stratification, BC\u2013\n\nfree scenario). The BC also affects the SACW intrusions by inertially overshooting\n\nthe shelf edge, consistent with what is expected for the estimated Rossby num-\n\nbers of ?0.3\u20130.5 along the shelf edge. Finally, the planetary ?\u2013effect is also found\n\nto account for a background equatorward PGFy?.\n\nIt was not our intention to accurately represent the coastal and deep\u2013ocean\n\ncirculation of the ESB, nor to develop a detailed understanding of all the physical\n\nprocesses involved in the problem. Therefore, many open questions remain. Fu-\n\nture work should be aimed at the effects on SACW intrusions of coastal trapped\n\nwaves, internal waves, and the energetic mesoscale eddy field associated with\n\nthe BC, among other processes. From an observational viewpoint, additional and\n\nbetter\u2013resolved quasi\u2013synoptic and moored observations on the middle shelf and\n\nshelf edge areas would allow for experimental testing of the model predictions\n\ndiscussed in the present study.\n\n\n\n56\n\nFigure 2.21: Schematic representation of the proposed South Atlantic Central Water (SACW)\nintrusion pathways and physical mechanisms in the Esp??rito Santo Basin (ESB).

The Brazil Current (BC) flows along the TB shelf edge, trans-\nporting cold South Atlantic Central Water and imparting a pressure gradient that\nwas found to extend throughout the shelf in the numerical solutions discussed in\nChapter 2. In this study, a simple Arrested Topographic Wave (ATW) analytical\nmodel is found to be successful in representing the general qualitative and quan-\ntitative features of these numerical solutions. The cross\u2013shelf e\u2013folding scales\nof the cross\u2013shelf velocity estimated from the numerical solutions agree in or-\nder of magnitude with the cross\u2013shelf penetration scale q?1 =\n\n?\n?2r/(lfs) = 10\n\nkm predicted by the ATW, where r is a linear bottom resistance parameter, l is\nthe along\u2013shelf wavenumber of the forcing at the shelf edge, f is the Coriolis\nparameter and s is the bottom slope. The numerical e\u2013folding scales decrease\nwith increasing forcing amplitude, and are found to be partially within the pre-\ndicted range for q?1, especially for stronger (> 60 cm s?1) BC core velocities. Fur-\nthermore, the use of quadratic bottom stress accounts for some of the relative\n\n\n\n58\n\nincrease in the numerical onshore penetration scales, which are predicted to be\nq?1quadratic =\n\n?\n?2CD/(lfs)\u00d7\n\n?\nUbot, where CD is a quadratic bottom friction param-\n\neter and Ubot is the near\u2013bottom velocity magnitude. The kind of steady response\nto periodic deep\u2013ocean forcing examined here may provide insight into other\ncontinental shelves under the influence of western boundary currents or other\ndeep\u2013ocean pressure gradients.\n\nKeywords: Arrested Topographic Wave, deep\u2013ocean forcing, coastal dynamics,\ncross\u2013shelf transport, Brazil Current.\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nMuch understanding on the time\u2013mean circulation of the coastal ocean has been\n\ngained with the classic Arrested Topographic Wave (ATW) model (Csanady, 1978).\n\nThe simplest forms of this model describe the steady\u2013state response of the coastal\n\nocean to pressure perturbations imparted by wind, river runoff or deep\u2013ocean\n\npressure gradients. The effects of the coastal boundary, friction and rotation\n\ncombine to diffuse the pressure perturbations throughout the shelf and produce\n\nalong\u2013shelf pressure gradients that are in partial geostrophic balance, giving rise\n\nto cross\u2013shelf transport.\n\nDifferent versions of the ATW model have been used to rationalize observa-\n\ntions and primitive\u2013equation model results. Schlichtholz (2002) showed that a\n\nmodified version of the ATW is consistent with hydrographic observations and in-\n\nverse solutions of the near\u2013bottom flow in Fram Strait. Miller et al. (2011) derived\n\na matched shelf\u2013slope ATW model to rationalize primitive\u2013equation numerical\n\nresults obtained by Matano &amp; Palma (2008) in the context of shelfbreak upwelling\n\nin the Patagonian shelf. Miller et al. (2011) showed that quantitative agreement\n\nwas found between the nonlinear, stratified primitive\u2013equation solutions and the\n\nmuch simpler linear, homogeneous ATW solution in their case.\n\nIn Chapter 2, process\u2013oriented numerical experiments were analyzed to in-\n\nvestigate the effects of forcing mechanisms related to the Brazil Current (BC) on\n\nintrusions of cold, nutrient\u2013rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) on the con-\n\ntinental shelf of the Tubara?o Bight (TB) area (19.5?S\u201322?S), off southeast Brazil.\n\nWith the neglect of wind forcing, the bulk of the onshore transport of SACW was\n\n\n\n59\n\nrelated to a geostrophically\u2013balanced pressure gradient force in the along\u2013isobath\n\ndirection, but the actual mechanisms behind the generation of this force were un-\n\nclear. In the present study, an ATW model forced by a sinusoidal pressure field\n\nat the shelf edge is used to rationalize some features of the numerical solutions\n\ndiscussed in Chapter 2. The modified ATW solution is derived in Section 3.2 and\n\ncompared to the numerical solutions in Section 3.3. Conclusions are presented in\n\nSection 3.4.\n\n3.2 The analytical model\n\nWe consider the idealized domain of a continental shelf in the southern hemi-\n\nsphere that is infinite in the meridional direction, with a solid coastal boundary\n\nat x = 0. A steady western boundary current flows poleward along the shelf\n\nedge, which is placed at x = L. The current has a periodic structure with wave-\n\nlength 2?/l in the along\u2013shelf direction. No wind forcing is prescribed.\n\nUnder the long\u2013wave (e.g., Gill &amp; Schumann, 1974) and f\u2013plane approxima-\n\ntions, the depth\u2013averaged equations of motion in the steady, linear and barotropic\n\nlimits are (e.g., Csanady, 1978):\n\n?fv = ?\n1\n\n?\npx (3.1a)\n\nfu = ?\n1\n\n?\npy ?\n\nrv\n\nh\n(3.1b)\n\n(uh)x + (vh)y = 0, (3.1c)\n\nwhere p is the depth\u2013averaged pressure, u and v are the cross\u2013 and along\u2013shelf\n\ndepth\u2013averaged velocities, f is the Coriolis parameter, ? = 1025 kg m?3 is density,\n\nr is a linear bottom resistance coefficient and h is depth. A linear cross\u2013shelf depth\n\nprofile of the form h = h0 + sx is chosen, with h0 = 0 m and s > 0. Subscripts\n\nwith respect to the independent variables (x,y) indicate partial differentiation.\n\nEquations 3.1a\u2013c may be combined into a single parabolic partial differential\n\n\n\n60\n\nequation for pressure, i.e.,\n\npxx +\nfs\n\nr\npy = 0. (3.2)\n\nAs pointed out by Csanady (1978), Equation 3.2 is analogous to the one\u2013dimen-\n\nsional heat equation. In this analogy, p is like temperature, the y direction is like\n\ntime, and the quantity r/(fs) is like thermal conductivity but has units of length.\n\nAs wind forcing is not included here, the boundary condition of no cross\u2013shelf\n\nflow at the coast (uh = 0 at x = 0) that follows from Equations 3.1a and 3.1b is\n\npx = 0. (3.3)\n\nThe boundary condition at the shelf edge (x = L) is chosen to approximate\n\nthe sinusoidal shape of the pressure field obtained in the numerical solutions\n\n(Figure 3.1):\n\np = a sin (ly), (3.4)\n\nwhere a and l are the amplitude and along\u2013shelf wavenumber of the pressure\n\nfield, respectively.\n\nThe boundary condition in the y direction is more elaborate. It is analogous\n\nto the initial condition of the heat equation, which represents the initial temper-\n\nature distribution along a one\u2013dimensional iron slab. In the present problem, it\n\nrepresents the cross\u2013shelf shape of the pressure field at a known along\u2013shelf po-\n\nsition. The rationale for neglecting this boundary condition is that we do not aim\n\nto study the along\u2013shelf spreading of an arbitrary cross\u2013shelf pressure perturba-\n\ntion like p(x, 0) = ?(x). Rather, we are concerned with the onshore penetration\n\nof a prescribed sinusoidal pressure field at the shelf edge. Defining k ??r/(fs),\n\nthe problem becomes\n\n\n\n61\n\npy = kpxx (3.5a)\n\npx(0,y) = 0 (3.5b)\n\np(L,y) = a sin (ly) (3.5c)\n\nin the domain 0 &lt;x &lt;L,?? &lt;y &lt;+?. Assume a periodic solution of the form\n\np\u00b1(x,y) = ?\u00b1(x)e\u00b1ily, (3.6)\n\nSuch that the full solution is p(x,y) = p+(x,y) + p?(x,y). Then plug Equation 3.6\n\ninto Equations 3.5a\u2013c. Using the fact that a sin (ly) = ia\n2\n\n(e?ily?e+ily), the following\n\npair of boundary value problems is obtained:\n\n?\u00b1xx ?\nil\n\nk\n?\u00b1 = 0 (3.7a)\n\n?\u00b1x (0) = 0 (3.7b)\n\n?\u00b1(L) = ?\nia\n\n2\n(3.7c)\n\nWe solve the problems for the unknowns ?+ and ?? separately. The general\n\nsolution for the ?+ problem has the form\n\n?+(x) = C1e\n?\n\nil\nk\nx + C2e\n\n?\n?\n\nil\nk\nx. (3.8)\n\nUsing boundary condition 3.7b, it follows that C1 = C2. For a non\u2013trivial solution,\n\nwe must have C1 = C2 6= 0. Next, using boundary condition 3.7c yields\n\nC1 = C2 = ?\nia\n\n2\n(e\n?\n\nil\nk\nL + e?\n\n?\nil\nk\nL)?1. (3.9)\n\nPlugging Equation 3.9 into Equation 3.8 gives the solution for ?+:\n\n?+(x) = ?\nia\n\n2\n\n(\ne\n?\n\nil\nk\nx + e?\n\n?\nil\nk\nx\n\ne\n?\n\nil\nk\nL + e?\n\n?\nil\nk\nL\n\n)\n.

(1 ? i) and q ?\n?\nl/(2k) =\n\n?\n?lfs/(2r), recalling that\n\nk ? ?r/(fs). We note that the e\u2013folding scale of p in the cross\u2013shelf direction\n\n(the real quantity q) depends not only on the conductivity parameter (k), but\n\nalso on the wavenumber of the forcing (l). q does not depend on the amplitude\n\nof the forcing (a). It is seen that the distance q?1 scales the onshore extent of\n\nthe deep\u2013ocean influence in the case of periodic forcing at the shelf edge. This\n\nresult is analogous to that of the periodic along\u2013shelf wind stress ATW problem,\n\n\n\n63\n\nwhere l represents the along\u2013shelf wavenumber of the along\u2013shelf wind stress\n\nfield (Csanady, 1978; Winant, 1979).\n\nThe choice of parameters a,l,f,s,r and L (Table 3.1) was guided by the nu-\n\nmerical solutions from experiment EXP\u2013smoo\u201321 (Chapter 2) and the approxi-\n\nmate geometry of the TB shelf. Although the solution is meridionally infinite, the\n\nfinite shelf length Ly considered here is intended to roughly match that of the\n\nTB shelf. The choice of pressure amplitude a corresponds to a reference ampli-\n\ntude of the numerical pressure gradient force (6.9 \u00d7 10?7 m s?2). The along\u2013shelf\n\nwavenumber l = 3?/Ly m?1 is set so as to simulate the numerical shelf edge\n\npressure field (Figure 3.1). The linear drag coefficient r is picked from a range\n\nthat has been found to agree well with observations (e.g., Pringle, 2002). The pre-\n\ndicted cross\u2013shore scale of deep\u2013ocean influence associated with these parame-\n\nters is q?1 =\n?\n?2r/(lfs) = 10 km. For reference, the internal Rossby radius of\n\ndeformation at the 70 m isobath is Ld = NH/f = 18 km, using the mean N value\n\nfor the TB shelf obtained in Chapter 2 (see Table 2.2).\n\nThe ATW solutions for the pressure and flow fields are shown in Figure 3.2.\n\nThe form of the solution is a mirror image of the solution to the periodic along\u2013\n\nshelf wind stress ATW problem. The alternating high and low pressure centers are\n\nassociated with bands of onshore and offshore flow, which cause onshore trans-\n\nport of oceanic water through preferential pathways on the shelf. The flow field\n\nis slanted in the direction of propagation of long coastal trapped waves (hereafter\n\nthe downwave direction).\n\nTable 3.1: Parameters used in the ATW model.\n\nParameter Value\n\na -16 N m?2\n\nl 4.42\u00d710?5 m?1\nf -5.10\u00d710?5 s?1\ns 2.68\u00d710?3\nr 3\u00d710?4 m s?1\nL 25 km\nLy 214 km\n\n1See Figure 2.15 for an example of the shelf\u2013wide spreading of the periodic along\u2013isobath\npressure gradient force.\n\n\n\n64\n\nFigure 3.1: Numerical time\u2013averaged (30 days) depth\u2013averaged along\u2013isobath Pressure Gradi-\nent Force (PGF) at the shelf edge (70 m isobath) as a function of along\u2013isobath distance.

The red arrows indicate areas of onshore\ntransport of water supplied at the shelf edge.\n\n\n\n66\n\n3.3 Comparison with primitive\u2013equation numerical\n\nsolutions\n\nWe begin with a qualitative comparison between the ATW solution and the nu-\n\nmerical solutions from Chapter 2. Figure 3.3 shows the time\u2013averaged depth\u2013\n\naveraged flow field from an experiment with a simplified (smoothed) topogra-\n\nphy, no wind forcing and a BC jet flowing along the shelf edge. The flow pattern\n\non the shelf bears qualitative similarities with the ATW solution (Figure 3.2), in\n\nthat there are closed streamlines and the isotachs are slanted in the downwave\n\ndirection.\n\nAs a consequence of the periodic nature of the forcing, any quantitative com-\n\nparison of shelf\u2013averaged quantities is highly sensitive to the choice of along\u2013\n\nshelf averaging length (assuming the wavenumber l of the forcing is held fixed).\n\nWe therefore compare the analytical and numerical solutions in terms of the cross\u2013\n\nshelf penetration scales. Figure 3.4 shows two examples of cross\u2013shelf profiles of\n\ndepth\u2013averaged cross\u2013isobath velocity (u), and the associated exponential fits.\n\nThe length scale q?1 =\n?\n\n2k/l =\n?\n?2r/(lfs) predicted by the ATW for values\n\nof the linear bottom friction parameter r in the canonical range 2\u20135 \u00d7 10?4 m s?1\n\n(e.g., Pringle, 2002) is consistent with the numerical results in terms of order of\n\nmagnitude.\n\nFor a bulk comparison, we averaged all of the fit e\u2013folding scales for each of\n\nthe ten cross\u2013shelf lines in Figure 3.3b to obtain a mean value and a standard de-\n\nviation for each BC flow amplitude. Figure 3.5 shows that q has a poorly defined\n\ndecreasing dependence on the forcing amplitude, meaning that a stronger incom-\n\ning BC flow tends to penetrate farther onshore. Predictions for q underestimate\n\nthe numerical exponential fits by ?0\u201340%, with better agreement obtained un-\n\nder stronger forcing. Evidently, the non\u2013constancy of the numerical penetration\n\nscales is partly attributable to the complexity of the primitive\u2013equation model.\n\nAnother important source of disagreement, however, is that the numerical so-\n\nlutions use a quadratic bottom stress parameterization, meaning that the equiva-\n\n\n\n67\n\nlent of the linear bottom friction parameter r is the quantity CDUbot, where CD is\n\na unitless quadratic bottom friction parameter (set to 3.0 \u00d7 10?3 in the numerical\n\nsolutions) and Ubot is the near\u2013bottom velocity magnitude. Physically, this means\n\nthat the predicted onshore penetration scale becomes a function of the forcing\n\namplitude (i.e., the BC core velocity). This new penetration scale is thus\n\nq?1quadratic =\n\n?\n?2CD\nlfs\n\n\u00d7\n?\nUbot, (3.17)\n\nmeaning that the onshore extent of deep\u2013ocean influence over the shelf increases\n\nwith the square root of Ubot. Assuming for simplicity that Ubot is proportional to\n\nthe BC core velocity, we used Equation 3.17 to estimate the predicted increments\n\nin qquadratic (relative to the first numerical solution, with a BC core velocity of 20\n\ncm s?1) and compared the result to the numerical e\u2013folding scales (Figure 3.5).\n\nFigure 3.3: Time\u2013averaged (30 days) flow fields from the numerical solution with a 60 cm s?1\nBC.

The numerical e\u2013folding scales estimated with a nonlinear least\u2013squares technique are\nshown.

The blue\nshading marks the analytical predicted range of linear onshore penetration scales q =\n\n?\nl/(2k) =?\n\n?lfs/(2r), considering a canonical range for the linear bottom friction parameter r = 2\u2013\n5 \u00d7 10?4 m s?1. The red dots mark the analytical curve of quadratic onshore penetration scales\nqquadratic =\n\n?\n?lfs/(2CD) \u00d7\n\n?\n1/Ubot, where CD = 3.0 \u00d7 10?3 is the quadratic bottom friction\n\nparameter used in the numerical solutions and Ubot is the magnitude of the near\u2013bottom velocity\n(assumed to be equal to the model BC core velocity for simplicity). qquadratic represents incre-\nments relative to the first numerical e\u2013folding scale (Ubot = 20 cm s?1) rather than absolute val-\nues. Representative values for the TB are used: Bottom slope s = 2.68 \u00d7 10?3, inertial frequency\nf = ?5.10\u00d710?5 s?1, and an along\u2013shelf wavenumber l = 4.42\u00d710?5 m?1 for the forcing at the\nshelf edge.\n\n\n\n70\n\n3.4 Conclusions\n\nProcess\u2013oriented numerical experiments discussed in Chapter 2 revealed a time\u2013\n\nmean periodic pressure field along the shelf edge in the TB area. Here, we pre-\n\nsented evidence suggesting that the steady response of the coastal circulation to\n\nthis deep\u2013ocean forcing imparted by the BC can be rationalized as a manifestation\n\nof the physics contained in a simple ATW model. The use of quadratic bottom\n\nstress in the ATW onshore penetration scale expression accounts for some of the\n\ndecrease of the numerical e\u2013folding scales, improving the agreement between the\n\nanalytical predictions and the numerical solutions. The weak, shelf\u2013wide ?0.2\u2013\n\n1.0 cm s?1 cross\u2013isobath ATW circulation could account for part of the onshore\n\ntransport of cold, nutrient\u2013rich SACW all the way to the inner shelf, provided that\n\nother physical processes have already transported it across the shelfbreak (e.g.,\n\ninertial overshooting of the BC). This process could therefore be an additional\n\nsupporting mechanism to the more energetic wind\u2013driven cross\u2013shelf circulation\n\nof SACW in the TB.\n\n\n\n71\n\nChapter 4\n\nFinal remarks\n\n4.1 Thesis summary\n\nThis thesis investigates the pathways of and the physical mechanisms associ-\n\nated with the intrusions of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) onto the Esp??rito\n\nSanto Basin (ESB) shelf (18?S\u201322?S, Brazil) by employing a combination of ob-\n\nservational, numerical and analytical approaches to distill the physical basis of\n\nthe phenomenon. In Chapter 2, a set of simplified, process\u2013oriented, primitive\u2013\n\nequation numerical experiments is used in conjunction with a more complete\n\nnumerical model and available observations to disentangle the kinematics and\n\ndynamics underlying the SACW intrusions. It is found that wind drives the shelf\n\ncirculation at leading order, in accord with previous findings. Preferential path-\n\nways of SACW intrusion are recognized in the model experiments off Aracruz\n\n(?20?S, where the shelf is narrowest) and in the area between Marata??zes and\n\nCape Sa?o Tome? (21?S\u201322?S). These locations are collocated with areas where an\n\nequatorward along\u2013isobath pressure gradient force (PGFy?) consistently forms at\n\nthe shelf edge in both the simplified and realistic model experiments. The PGFy?\n\nis found to be nearly in geostrophic balance and to spread over most of shelf,\n\nthereby accelerating a geostrophic onshore flow. The along\u2013isobath geostrophic\n\nbalance is modified by nonlinear momentum advection at mid\u2013depth and by fric-\n\ntion within the bottom Ekman layer. Typical magnitudes for the model time\u2013\n\nmean, depth\u2013averaged PGFy? are 5 \u00d7 10?7 m s?2\u20135 \u00d7 10?6 m s?2, associated with\n\n\n\n72\n\nonshore velocities of ?1\u20135 cm s?1. Buoyancy arrest might be important during\n\nvigorous SACW intrusions, owing to the observed range of values for the slope\n\nBurger number1 (0.32\u20130.92). Three higher\u2013order deep\u2013ocean physical processes\n\nare identified and quantified. Specifically, the intrinsic thermocline uplifting ef-\n\nfect of the model Brazil Current (BC) is found to bring ?1.4?C colder water to the\n\nsurface under steady, upwelling\u2013favorable wind forcing (relative to a flat, BC\u2013free\n\nscenario). Moreover, the ?0.3\u20130.5 values estimated for the Rossby number along\n\nthe shelf edge suggest that the BC is prone to inertial overshooting, giving rise\n\nto local intrusions of SACW at the shelf edge. Finally, the planetary ?\u2013effect is\n\nestimated to account for an additional background O(10?7 m s?2) equatorward\n\nPGFy? along the shelf edge.\n\nIn Chapter 3, the question of the onshore transmission of the time\u2013mean pres-\n\nsure perturbations imparted by the BC at the shelf edge is further examined under\n\nthe framework of an analytical Arrested Topographic Wave (ATW) model. Com-\n\nparison with the primitive\u2013equation numerical solutions discussed in Chapter 2\n\nsuggests that the physics contained in the ATW model is indeed a plausible ratio-\n\nnalization for most of the features obtained in the numerical solutions. Specifi-\n\ncally, the cross\u2013shelf e\u2013folding scales estimated from the numerical solutions are\n\nfound to agree in order of magnitude with the cross\u2013shelf onshore penetration\n\nscale\n?\n?2r/(lfs) = 10 km predicted by the ATW, where r is a linear bottom re-\n\nsistance parameter, l is the along\u2013shelf wavenumber of the shelf edge forcing, f\n\nis the Coriolis parameter and s is the bottom slope. The numerical penetration\n\nlength scales are found to generally increase with BC amplitudes. Best agreement\n\nbetween numerical and theoretical penetration scales are found for stronger (>60\n\ncm s?1) BC core velocities. Furthermore, agreement improves when quadratic bot-\n\ntom stress is introduced. In the quadratic case, the relative increase in the numer-\n\nical onshore penetration scales is roughly predicted. The quadratic cross\u2013shelf\n\nlength scale becomes q?1quadratic =\n?\n?2CD/(lfs) \u00d7\n\n?\nUbot, where CD is a quadratic\n\nbottom friction parameter and Ubot is a near\u2013bottom velocity magnitude.\n\n1The slope Burger number can be defined as S ? ?N/f, where ? is the bottom slope, N is the\nstratification frequency and f is the Coriolis parameter.\n\n\n\n73\n\n4.2 Future work\n\nThe regional picture that emerges from this study is that of a scale\u2013dependent\n\ncross\u2013isobath coastal circulation, which is wind\u2013driven at leading order, but mod-\n\nulated by deep\u2013ocean processes at next order. Further investigation of a number\n\nof open questions is key to better understanding, modeling and predicting the re-\n\ngional coastal ocean in the Esp??rito Santo Basin. Some of the questions that future\n\nwork on this subject should address are:\n\n1. How important to the South Atlantic Central Water intrusions is the Brazil Cur-\n\nrent mesoscale eddy field in the Esp??rito Santo Basin? What are the physical mech-\n\nanisms involved?\n\n2. What is the role of coastal\u2013trapped waves in the cross\u2013shelf circulation in the\n\nEsp??rito Santo Basin? Are there important resonant effects with the deep\u2013ocean\n\nforcings?\n\n3. What is the effect of internal waves in the intrusions of South Atlantic Central\n\nWater in the Tubara?o Bight?\n\n4. Does buoyancy arrest inflict strong constraints on intrusions of South Atlantic\n\nCentral Water in the Esp??rito Santo Basin?\n\n5. What are the physical mechanisms involved in the intrusions of Tropical Water in\n\nthe Esp??rito Santo Basin?\n\n6. Are cross\u2013shelf intrusions and extrusions in the Esp??rito Santo Basin associated\n\nwith submesoscale processes (e.g., mixed layer instabilities and filaments) compa-\n\nrable in magnitude with their mesoscale counterparts?\n\nFinding answers to these questions will probably entail a variety of methods.\n\nPersonally, I feel that the thoughtful combination of process\u2013oriented primitive\u2013\n\nequation numerical modeling and observations (both in situ and remote) is a\n\npowerful approach for developing a mechanistic view of the core physics of a\n\nsystem, which may in turn be rationalized in terms of much simpler models.\n\n\n\n74\n\nBibliography\n\nAguiar, A., M.
