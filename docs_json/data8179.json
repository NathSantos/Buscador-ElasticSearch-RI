It is generally recognized that the type of diet is \n\nan important risk factor for CRC and tumor behavior. Interest in the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) \n\nproduction by propionibacteria from dairy diet, on the human organism has increased rapidly in \n\nthe last ten years due to the fact that gastrointestinal functions and beneficial effects are \n\nassociated with these acids. SCFAs, namely butyrate, propionate and acetate are the major \n\nproducts of the propionibacteria fermentation and metabolism of undigested dietary fibers in the \n\nhuman large intestine. These SCFA have been reported as anti-proliferative and anti-neoplastic \n\nagents that induce differentiation, growth arrest and apoptosis in CRC cells lines. It is known that \n\nSCFAs protect against development of CRC and therefore, in this monographic review we focus \n\non new aspects of cellular functions of SCFAs as a nutraceuticals in the prevention and/or \n\ntreatment of CRC. In this context we also aimed at developing a simple, feasible and easily \n\nimplemented protocols for undergraduate students in secondary school labs using protocols with  \n\nbaker\u00b4s yeast cells to illustrate the effect of acetic acid on two key cellular biological processes, \n\nnamely on cell cycle and cell death. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\niv \n \n\nResumo \n\nO carcinoma colorretal (CCR) \u00e9 um tumor maligno comum no mundo ocidental, mas \u00e9 \n\ntamb\u00e9m considerado um dos cancros mais evit\u00e1veis. \u00c9 geralmente reconhecido que o tipo de \n\ndieta \u00e9 um importante fator de risco para o desenvolvimento e o comportamento deste tipo de \n\ncancro. O interesse nos \u00e1cidos gordos de cadeia curta (AGCC), produzidos no organismo \n\nhumano pelas propionibacterias presentes nos lactic\u00ednios, cresceu rapidamente nos \u00faltimos dez \n\nanos, uma vez que v\u00e1rias fun\u00e7\u00f5es gastrointestinais e efeitos ben\u00e9ficos est\u00e3o associados a estes \n\n\u00e1cidos.

Hallmarks of cancer: the role of apoptosis \n \n\nCancer is a very heterogeneous disease, developing in different tissue types and \n\ndisplaying great genetic diversity. Every day our body produces potentially malignant cells. These, \n\nhowever, should not be considered cancerous, we only should name it cancer when there is \n\nclinical manifestation or evidence of increased cell proliferation and capability of metastasize in \n\nthe organism (Sim\u00f5es, 2010). \n\nThere are several evidences which indicate that tumourigenesis in humans is a multistep \n\nprocess and that these steps reflect genetic alterations that drive the progressive transformation \n\nof normal human cells into highly malignant derivatives (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 2000). However, \n\nrecent insights suggest that the underlying etiology and progression of the disease can be \n\nreduced to two events, mutations that give rise to excessive proliferation and a compensatory \n\ndisruption of survival signaling pathways that ensures the persistence of these hyperproliferative \n\ncells (Green &amp; Evan, 2002).  \n\nHanahan and Weinberg (2000) proposed that six capabilities acquired during tumor \n\ndevelopment are shared in common by most and perhaps all types of human tumors. These six \n\nessential alterations in cell physiology that collectively dictate malignant growth are: self-\n\nsufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to growth-inhibitory (antigrowth) signals, evasion of \n\nproto growth-inhibitory (antigrowth) signals, evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis), \n\nlimitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion and metastasis \n\n(Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 2000). Two enabling characteristics crucial to the acquisition of the six \n\nhallmark capabilities are the two new emerging hallmark capabilities, the metabolic alterations \n\nand signaling interactions of the tumor microenvironment crucial to cancer phenotypes (Figure 1) \n\n(Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n3 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Emerging Hallmarks and Enabling Characteristics (Adapted from Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 2011). \n\n \n\nNormal tissues carefully control the production and release of growth-promoting signals \n\nthat instruct entry into and progression through the cell growth-and-division cycle, thereby \n\nensuring a homeostasis of cell number and thus maintenance of normal tissue architecture and \n\nfunction. Cancer cells, by deregulating these signals, become \u201cmasters of their own destinies\u201d \n\n(Claesson et al., 2012). The ability of tumor cell populations to expand is determined not only by \n\nthe rate of cell proliferation but also by the rate of cell death, being programmed cell death \u2013 \n\napoptosis \u2013 the major source of this death. The evidence come mainly from studies in mouse \n\nmodels and cultured cells, as well as from analyses of human cancer tissue, that showed that \n\ncancer cells acquired resistance toward apoptosis which is a hallmark of most and perhaps all \n\ntypes of cancer (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 2000).  \n\nApoptosis is a genetically predetermined mechanism that may be elicited by several \n\nmolecular pathways and organisms can trigger this process to remove unwanted and potentially \n\nAvoiding imune destruction \n\nGenome instability and mutation Tumor-promoting inflammation \n\nDeregulating celular energetics \n\nEmerging Hallmarks \n\nEnabling Characteristics \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n4 \n \n\ndangerous cells. The activation of apoptotic genes culminate in morphological and biochemical \n\nchanges leading to chromatin condensation followed by nuclear condensation, DNA \n\nfragmentation and packing of nuclear fragments into multiple membrane-enclosed apoptotic \n\nbodies (Ramos, Rabelo, Duarte, Gazzinelli, &amp; Alvarez-Leite, 2002). Apoptosis can be also \n\nregulated via the action of several oncogenes and subsequently oncoproteins (Salakou et al., \n\n2007). \n\nThere are two different apoptosis pathways, called the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In \n\nthe extrinsic pathway (also known as \u201cdeath receptor pathway\u201d), apoptosis is activated by the \n\ncell-surface death receptors CD95 (Apo-1 or Fas)/TRAIL/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 \n\nfamily proteins which are located on the plasma membrane, and directly activates the caspase \n\ncascade via the recruitment of the \u201cinitiator\u201d caspase-8 within a death-inducing signaling complex \n\n(DISC). The intrinsic pathway (also called \u201cmitochondrial pathway\u201d), leads to the release of \n\ncytochrome c from the damaged mitochondrion, which then binds to the adaptor molecule APAF-\n\n1 and an inactive \u201cinitiator\u201d caspase, procaspase 9, within a multiprotein complex called the \n\napoptosome. This leads to the activation of caspase 9, which then triggers a cascade of caspases \n\nactivation (caspases 3 and 7) resulting in the morphological and biochemical changes associated \n\nwith apoptosis (Tzifi et al., 2012). Caspase activated cell death is regulated by genes of the Bcl-2 \n\nfamily, for instance by the pro- and anti-apoptotic genes, Bax and Bcl-2, respectively (Fauser, \n\nPrisciandaro, Cummins, &amp; Howarth, 2011; Jin &amp; El-Deiry, 2005). Currently, the intrinsic \n\napoptotic pathway is more widely implicated as a barrier to cancer pathogenesis. Both apoptotic \n\npathways are targets for cancer treatment (Shao, Gao, Marks, &amp; Jiang, 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n5 \n \n\n    Figure 2 - Schematic representation of apoptotic pathways.  \n\n \n\n2. Colorectal carcinoma  \n \n\nColorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and \n\nthe second in females, with over 1.2 million cancer cases in the world, accounting for 9.8% of \n\ntotal cancer cases, according to data from GLOBOCAN project (2008). In Europe, the incidence \n\nof CRC is 229.229 cases, accounting for 13.5% of total cancer cases. In Portugal, the CRC is the \n\nsecond most prevalent cancer (after prostate cancer) with an incidence number of 3951 cases \n\nand an incidence rate of 16.5% of total cancer cases (Globocan project, 2008, \n\nhttp://globocan.iarc.fr/). Cancer prevention is an essential component of cancer control \n\nstrategies because about 40% of all cancer deaths can be prevented (World Health Organization, \n\n2008, http://www.who.int/en/). \n\nStudies reported that dietary patterns, lifestyle, physical inactivity and obesity increased \n\nCRC risks, especially in genetically predisposed populations (Doll &amp; Peto, 1981; Potter, 1999; \n\nQin et al., 2010). CRC is thus causally related to both genes and environment. Environment is a \n\nrisk factor that may cause mutations and initiate cancer or enhance growth by genetic and \n\nepigenetic mechanisms (Ferguson, 1999; Sim\u00f5es, 2010) .  \n\nhttp://globocan.iarc.fr/\nhttp://www.who.int/en/\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n6 \n \n\n2.1. Types of colorectal carcinoma \n \n\nAbout 75% of patients with CRC have sporadic disease with no apparent evidence of \n\nhaving inherited the disorder. The remaining 25% of patients have a family history of CRC that \n\nsuggests a hereditary contribution, common exposures among family members, or a combination \n\nof both. Genetic mutations have been identified as the cause of inherited cancer risk in some \n\ncolon cancer-prone families; these mutations are estimated to account for only 5% to 6% of CRC \n\ncases overall. It is likely that other undiscovered genes and genetic factors contribute to the \n\ndevelopment of familial CRC in conjunction with nongenetic risk factors (National Cancer \n\nInstitute, 2013, http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/genetics/colorectal). Among the non-\n\nsporadic CRC cases, 5 to 15% can be attributed to the following hereditary CRC syndromes: \n\nLynch syndrome (also hereditary nonpolyposis CRC or HNPCC), familial adenomatous polyposis \n\n(FAP), and MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) (Castells, Castellvi-Bel, &amp; Balaguer, 2009).  \n\nTwo-thirds of CRCs are located in the rectum, rectosigmoid, or sigmoid colon with the \n\nother third distributed in the remainder of the colon. Adenocarcinomas are the most common \n\ntype of CRC and have its origin in intestinal epithelial cells. The progression from adenoma to \n\ncarcinoma occurs by the sequential accumulation of genetic changes, which is the more \n\naccepted model for understanding carcinogenesis process (presented in Figure 3) (Bruckner et \n\nal. 2000) Available from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20861/; Cancer Research \n\nUK).   \n\nAdenocarcinomas start in the intestinal gland cells in the lining of the colon wall. There \n\nare one or two rare types of adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum, called mucinous tumors \n\nand signet ring tumors and these terms refer to how the cells look under the microscope. Only \n\nabout 1 to 2% of colorectal cancers are the signet ring type. Squamous cells cancers are the skin \n\nlike cells that make up the bowel lining together with the gland cells. Carcinoid is an unusual type \n\nof slow growing tumor called a neuroendocrine tumor. Between 4 to 17% of every carcinoid \n\ntumors diagnosed start in the rectum and between 2 to 7% out of every carcinoid tumors \n\ndiagnosed begin in the large bowel. Sarcomas are cancers of the supporting cells of the body, \n\nsuch as bone or muscle. Most sarcomas found in the colon or rectum are leiomyosarcomas, \n\nwhich account for less than 2% of colorectal carcinomas and have a high chance of \n\nmetastasizing. Lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system. Only about 1 in 100 cancers \n\nhttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/genetics/colorectal\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n7 \n \n\ndiagnosed in the colon or rectum (1%) are lymphomas (Cancer Research UK, 2013, \n\nhttp://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/bowel-cancer/about/types-of-bowel-cancer). \n\n \n\n2.2. Colorectal carcinoma: associated genetic alterations  \n \n\nThe model of cell transformation and progression from adenoma to colorectal carcinoma \n\nis based on the concept that progression is accompanied by the accumulation of molecular \n\nalterations in which adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), K-RAS, and p53 genes play a central role \n\n(presented in Figure 3) (Fearon &amp; Vogelstein, 1990). A number of data indicate that the \n\nsimultaneous presence of alterations of these genes is not a frequent event. In particular, K-RAS \n\nand p53 mutations rarely co-exist in the same tumor, indicating that these alterations do not \n\nrepresent a synergistic evolutionary pathway (Smith et al., 2002). \n\nIt was found that somatic mutations in APC gene are also found in the great majority of \n\nsporadic colorectal tumors (Miyoshi et al., 1992). APC has been proposed to function as a \n\n\u2018\u2018gatekeeper\u2019\u2019 gene, regulating the entry of epithelial cells into adenoma-carcinoma progression \n\n(Kinzler &amp; Vogelstein, 1996), maintaining low levels of ?-catenin in the absence of a Wnt signal, \n\nthus preventing excessive cell proliferation. Axis duplication and cell transformation are based on \n\nthe activation of the canonical Wnt pathway that involves the multifunctional protein ?-catenin \n\n(Rao &amp; Kuhl, 2010). A mutation of the gatekeeper leads to a permanent imbalance of cell division \n\nover cell death (Kinzler &amp; Vogelstein, 1996).  \n\nThe RAS oncogene promotes tumor formation through stimulation of cell proliferation, \n\nmotility and regulation of apoptosis. Activating mutations in the RAS oncogenes (H-, N-, and K-\n\nRAS) are found in approximately 20% of all human tumors (Shaw et al., 2011) and mediates \n\nseveral key aspects of oncogenesis, including deregulated cell growth, evasion of apoptosis and \n\nmalignant transformation, a consequence of the loss of GTPase activity (Shaw et al., 2011; Smith \n\net al., 2002). The TP53 gene product, p53, functions as a transcription factor, exerting cell cycle \n\ncontrol by binding to specific recognition sequences in a variety of genes including p21, Bax, and \n\nBcl-2 in response to DNA damage or other cellular stress (A. J. Levine, 1997). About 70% of \n\nCRCs contain p53 mutations (Baker et al., 1990), rendering them susceptible to failure of \n\napoptosis and increased accumulation of DNA damage, allowing unregulated growth (el-Deiry et \n\nal., 1993; Williams, Coxhead, &amp; Mathers, 2003). These mutations in p53 are proposed to be \n\nrelatively late events in the development of colorectal tumors, with the loss of p53-mediated \n\nhttp://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/bowel-cancer/about/types-of-bowel-cancer\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n8 \n \n\npathways of apoptosis considered to be an important determinant of progression from adenoma \n\nto malignant tumor (Smith et al., 2002).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Genetic changes associated with colorectal tumorigenesis (Adapted from Kinzler &amp; Vogelstein, 1996; \n\nSmith et al., 2002). \n\n \n\nBRAF is one of the RAF genes involved in the important RAS/RAF/MEK/MAP kinase \n\nintracellular signaling pathway, which regulates different physiological processes including cell \n\ngrowth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Calistri et al., 2005; Fang &amp; Richardson, 2005). BRAF-\n\nactivating gene mutations have been detected in many tumor types (Davies et al., 2002). \n\nHowever, Calistri et al. (2005) observed a very low frequency of mutations in their series of \n\nsporadic colorectal carcinoma, and no evident association with other specific gene mutations, \n\nsuggesting that BRAF could represent an alternative pathway to both p53 and K-RAS genes, \n\nmainly in hereditary CRC characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI) (Calistri et al., 2005). \n\nIt is thought that at least 50% of colorectal cancers have a deregulation of the MAPK \n\npathway (Fang &amp; Richardson, 2005). Two major oncogenes are implicated in sporadic colorectal \n\ncarcinogenesis, KRAS and BRAF mutations, which are alternative (Oliveira et al., 2007). \n\nMutations on KRAS and BRAF genes are frequently found in malignant and pre-malignant \n\ncolorectal lesions (Rajagopalan et al., 2002). Mutations of the KRAS proto-oncogene are an early \n\nevent in development of CRCs (Bos et al., 1987). KRAS oncogene is mutated  in 21% of all \n\nhuman sporadic cancers, including in about 30% of CRCs cases (Fang &amp; Richardson, 2005; \n\nOliveira et al., 2007), and BRAF mutations are found in 20% of all human cancers, including in \n\nabout 10% CRCs cases (Ahlquist et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2007; Velho, Corso, Oliveira, &amp; \n\nSeruca, 2010). \n\nNormal epithelia Dysplatic epithelia Adenoma Carcinoma Metastic \n\ncancer \n\nAPC \nK-RAS p53 \n\nBenign                                            Malignant \n\nOther \n\nchanges? \n\nDNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes deficiency \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n9 \n \n\n2.3. Classical chemotherapy for colorectal carcinoma \n \n\nAccording to Sobrinho Sim\u00f5es (2010), there will never be possible for medicine to cure \n\nadvanced cancers. However, there will have a percentage of cancers that are always curable, \n\nthose who are localized \u201cin situ\u201d when diagnosed early that can be removed by surgical \n\ntechniques that have evolved in the past years. Currently, over 50% of cancers can be cured by \n\nsurgery and the other 50% have no cure; medicine only can keep them in a state of equilibrium \n\nwith the immune defenses. In these cases cancer may be regarded as a chronic disease: the \n\ncancer exists, but the disease does not manifest or at least it is mitigated. Oddly enough, cancer \n\nis a disease extremely inefficient, hence the hope of turning it into a chronic disease (Sim\u00f5es, \n\n2010). \n\nThe development of CRC often follows a defined pattern. The entire process frequently \n\ntakes a long period, like decades, before a malignant tumor is finally formed, and is thought to \n\ndevelop in a multistep process, known as the \u201cadenoma-carcinoma sequence\u201d (Vogelstein et al., \n\n1988). Because colon epithelia are directly exposed to dietary compounds, elimination of \n\nprecancerous or cancerous cells by nutritional or chemopreventive interventions, or both, \n\nrepresents an approach to the lowering of the incidence of colon cancer (Cai et al., 2006; Dove-\n\nEdwin &amp; Thomas, 2001) . \n\nThe current therapies are those in which a protein modification is identified in cancer. All \n\nmodern drugs fall into one of two groups: either are small molecules which inhibit proteins \n\naction, which enter into the cell, or antibodies which are fixed on the cell surface, blocking, for \n\nexample, receptors that are greatly increased in some cancer cells. These receptors stop working \n\nand the cell ceases to have the incentive to proliferate (Sim\u00f5es, 2010). In the last two decades \n\nseveral advances were achieved in the treatment of CRC. With more effective drugs, improved \n\nsurgery, better radiotherapy and a strong randomized clinical trials evidence base, patients now \n\nhave a higher chance of cure and, when cure is not achievable, they survive longer with their \n\ndisease (Braun &amp; Seymour, 2011). The optimum treatment strategy for patients with CRC \n\ndepends on a large number of factors, such as age, performance status,  the presence of other \n\ndisorders or diseases and the treatment setting (adjuvant versus palliative versus neoadjuvant) \n\n(Braun &amp; Seymour, 2011). The main types of treatment that can be used for colon and rectal \n\ncarcinoma are surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Surgery is the \n\nonly curative treatment for CRC. Depending on the stage of the cancer, two or more of these \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n10 \n \n\ntypes of treatment may be combined at the same time or used after one another (American \n\nCancer Society, 2013, \n\nhttp://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/detailedguide/colorectal-cancer-treating-\n\nchemotherapy). \n\nIn recent years new different approaches to nutritional treatment have been used to \n\ncorrect the deficits observed in patients with colorectal cancer (de Oliveira &amp; Aarestrup, 2012), \n\nsuch as the use of nutraceuticals. \n\n \n\n3. Nutraceuticals in colorectal carcinoma prevention or therapy \n \n\nIn the last years several products have been commercialized in the form of \n\npharmaceutical products, such as pills, tablets, solutions, etc., incorporating food extracts or \n\nphytochemical?enriched extracts to which a beneficial physiological function has been directly or \n\nindirectly attributed (Palthur, 2010). This variety of products cannot be truly classified as \u201cfood\u201d \n\nor \u201cpharmaceutical\u201d, so a combined term between nutrients and pharmaceuticals, \n\n\u201cnutraceuticals\u201d, has been coined to designate them (Espin, Garcia-Conesa, &amp; Tomas-Barberan, \n\n2007).  \n\nAccording to Stephen Defelice (1995) \u201ca nutraceutical is any substance that is a food or \n\npart of a food and provides medical or health benefits, including the prevention and treatment of \n\ndisease. Such products may range from isolated nutrients, dietary supplements and specific diets \n\nto genetically engineered designer foods, herbal products, and processed foods such as cereals, \n\nsoups and beverages\u201d (DeFelice, 1995). However, there is often confusion in the use of this \n\nterminology as there is a slight difference between the functional foods and nutraceuticals. When \n\nfood is being cooked or prepared using \"scientific intelligence\" with or without knowledge of how \n\nor why it is being used, the food is called \"functional food\". Functional food provides the body \n\nwith the required amount of vitamins, fats, proteins, carbohydrates, etc. needed for its healthy \n\nsurvival. When functional food helps in the prevention and/or treatment of disease(s) and/or \n\ndisorder(s) it is called a nutraceutical (Pandey, 2010). \n\nThe nutraceuticals revolution began in the early 1980s, sparked off when the actual or \n\npotential clinical benefits of calcium, fiber and fish oil were supported by clinical studies \n\npublished in distinguished medical journals, and when physicians began to educate their \n\ncolleagues and consumers about these substances via the media (DeFelice, 1995). Within \n\nhttp://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/detailedguide/colorectal-cancer-treating-chemotherapy\nhttp://www.cancer.org/cancer/colonandrectumcancer/detailedguide/colorectal-cancer-treating-chemotherapy\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n11 \n \n\nEuropean Medicines law, a nutraceutical can be defined as a medicine for two reasons: it can be \n\nused for the prevention, treatment or cure of a condition or disease or it can be administered \n\nwith a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions in human beings \n\n(Richardson, 1996). However, no specific regulation exists in Europe to control nutraceuticals \n\n(Espin et al., 2007). The majority of the definitions indicate the health benefits of nutraceuticals \n\nand among these health benefits are prevention and treatment of diseases.  \n\nThe major impact of eating habits on the prevalence of CRC has triggered efforts to \n\ndesign an optimal diet and/or to create food supplements specifically reducing the risk of cancer. \n\nAlready in 1989 Fuller checked the growing interest in the use of live microbial agents for health \n\nmaintenance and disease prevention or treatment (Fuller, 1989). \n\n \n\n3.1. Prebiotics \n \n\nA prebiotic was first defined by Gibson and Roberfroid as \u2018\u2018a nondigestible food ingredient \n\nthat beneficially affects the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a \n\nlimited number of bacteria in the colon, and thus improves host health\u2019\u2019 (G. R. Gibson &amp; \n\nRoberfroid, 1995). However many food components, especially many food oligosaccharides and \n\npolysaccharides (including dietary fiber), have been claimed to have prebiotic activity without due \n\nconsideration to the criteria required.  \n\nIn practical terms, prebiotics are short-chain carbohydrates (SCCs) that are nondigestible \n\nby human enzymes and that have been called resistant SCCs. They are sometimes referred to as \n\nnondigestible oligosaccharides (NDOs). Nonetheless, NDOs are not strictly oligosaccharides and \n\ntheir nondigestibility is largely assumed but not always proved (Cummings, Macfarlane, &amp; \n\nEnglyst, 2001). An oligosaccharide, according to the International Union of Pure and Applied \n\nChemistry Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (IUPAC-IUB JCBN) definition, is a \n\nmolecule containing a small number (2 to about 10) of monosaccharide residues connected by \n\nglycosidic linkages (\"IUPAC-IUB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (JCBN). \n\nAbbreviated terminology of oligosaccharide chains. Recommendations 1980,\" 1982). Some of \n\nthe carbohydrates that are named prebiotics often fall outside this definition because several of \n\nthem have a degree of polymerization (DP) higher than 10 (Cummings et al., 2001). Not all \n\ndietary carbohydrates are prebiotics, and clear criteria need to be established for classifying a \n\nfood ingredient as a prebiotic. These criteria are, by Gibson and Roberfroid, (1) to resist gastric \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n12 \n \n\nacidity, hydrolysis by mammalian enzymes and gastrointestinal absorption; (2) to be fermented \n\nby the intestinal microflora; (3) to stimulate selectively the growth and/or activity of intestinal \n\nbacteria associated with health and wellbeing (G. R. Gibson, Probert, Loo, Rastall, &amp; Roberfroid, \n\n2004).  \n\nIn 2004 the definition was updated when prebiotics were defined as \u201cselectively \n\nfermented ingredients that allow specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the \n\ngastrointestinal microflora that confer benefits upon host wellbeing and health\u201d (G. R. Gibson et \n\nal., 2004). The definition considers microflora changes in the whole gastrointestinal tract and \n\nextrapolates the definition into other areas that may benefit from a selective targeting of \n\nbifidobacteria and lactobacilli (Bellei G., 2012). Any dietary material that is non-digestible and \n\nenters the large intestine is a candidate prebiotic. This includes polysaccharide-type \n\ncarbohydrates such as resistant starch and dietary fiber, as well as proteins and lipids. However, \n\ncurrent prebiotics are confined to non-digestible oligosaccharides, many of which seem to confer \n\nthe degree of fermentation selectivity that is required (regarding bifidobacteria)(G. G. Gibson et \n\nal., 2010)  \n\nThis prebiotics compounds have been shown to be a source of SCFA both in vitro and in \n\nvivo. Pan et al (2009) demonstrated, using a rat model, that the intake of selected prebiotic \n\noligosaccharides improved concentrations of feacal SCFA, including butyrate (Pan et al., 2009). \n\nBy producing a greater concentration of butyrate, the preferred energy source for colonocytes \n\n(Scheppach, 1994), a trophic effect may result within the gastrointestinal tract (Pan et al., 2009). \n\nHence, prebiotics can have an impact on gut health in general, and are believed to play an \n\nimportant role in the prevention of CRC, as it has been highlighted by a Fotiadis and co-workers \n\nreview (Fotiadis, Stoidis, Spyropoulos, &amp; Zografos, 2008). For example, Bindels et al. (2012) \n\nproposed that propionate production by propionibacteria could be one of the gut microbial \n\nfunctions responsible for the anti-tumor effect of prebiotic nutrients (Bindels et al., 2012) . \n\nAmong the established prebiotics, inulin-type fructans, present in foods, have been \n\nstudied widely in the setting of CRC (Pool-Zobel, 2005) and have been demonstrated to elevate \n\nthe levels of bifidobacteria and to increase SCFA concentrations in the colon (Bouhnik et al., \n\n1999). Various studies have shown that these prebiotics prevent chemically induced \n\npreneoplastic lesions, aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and tumors in the colon of rats and mice (Reddy, \n\nHamid, &amp; Rao, 1997; Verghese, Rao, Chawan, &amp; Shackelford, 2002). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n13 \n \n\n3.2. Probiotics \n \n\nThe term probiotic was first used in 1965 in contrast to the word antibiotic and defined \n\nas \u201csubstances secreted by one microorganism, which stimulates the growth of another\u201d \n\n(Schrezenmeir &amp; de Vrese, 2001). These probiotics are nonpathogenic micro-organisms that, \n\nwhen ingested, exert a positive influence on the health or physiology of the host (Fuller, 1989). \n\nThey can influence intestinal physiology either directly or indirectly through regulation of the \n\nendogenous microflora. This complex multicellular entity plays an important role in maintaining \n\nhomeostasis in the body (Macfarlane &amp; Macfarlane, 2012).  \n\nThe mammalian intestinal tract contains a complex, dynamic, and diverse microbial \n\ncommunity dominated by nonpathologic bacteria or \u201cgood bacteria\u201d (Teitelbaum &amp; Walker, \n\n2002). The vast majority of bacteria in the human body reside in the large intestine, where the \n\nslow transit time, availability of nutrients, anaerobic conditions and pH are favorable for microbial \n\ngrowth (G. G. Gibson et al., 2010). Colonic microorganisms have ample opportunity to degrade \n\navailable substrates, which may be derived from either the diet or by endogenous secretions \n\n(Bergman, 1990; Cummings &amp; Macfarlane, 1991; Miller &amp; Wolin, 1979). Bacterial fermentation \n\ninvolves a variety of reactions and metabolic processes in the anaerobic microbial breakdown of \n\norganic matter, yielding metabolizable energy for microbial growth and maintenance and other \n\nmetabolic end products for use by the host (Cummings &amp; Macfarlane, 1991; Wong, de Souza, \n\nKendall, Emam, &amp; Jenkins, 2006). In terms of end products, a variety of different metabolites \n\narise, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as acetate, propionate and butyrate, (G. R. \n\nGibson, Willems, Reading, &amp; Collins, 1996). Thus, carbohydrate fermentation generally leads to \n\nhealth promoting SCFA production (Figure 4). \n\nEach person has a distinct and highly variable microbiota, but a conserved set of gut \n\ncolonizers (the core gut microbiota) and genes (the core microbiome) are shared among \n\nindividuals (Qin et al., 2010; Turnbaugh et al., 2009) and may be required for the correct \n\nfunctioning of the gut (Tremaroli &amp; Backhed, 2012). The human gut microflora differs in \n\ncomposition between infants and adults at various stages of life. Initial bacterial colonization of \n\nthe human intestine begins at birth and on weaning Bifidobacteria decrease and a more \u201cadult\u201d \n\nprofile of bacteria are present. In healthy elderly people, a decrease in the number of Bacteroides \n\nand Bifidobacteria has been reported (Roy, Kien, Bouthillier, &amp; Levy, 2006). It is important that \n\nolder people ingest sufficient amounts of dietary fiber to obtain the required amount of SCFA in \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n14 \n \n\nthe gut lumen. Dietary supplements with defined food ingredients that promote particular \n\ncomponents of the microbiota may also prove useful for maintaining health in older people \n\n(Claesson et al., 2012; Macfarlane &amp; Macfarlane, 2012) . \n\nWhen probiotics are ingested, they are able to resist the physicochemical conditions \n\nprevailing in the digestive tract. The strains most frequently used as probiotics consist mostly of \n\nstrains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus, bacterial types which have been \n\nused for centuries in the production of fermented dairy products (Fooks &amp; Gibson, 2002; \n\nHeyman &amp; Menard, 2002). Because of all their benefits, probiotics represent an emerging \n\ntherapeutic option. There is accumulating evidence describing the capacity for probiotic strains to \n\nprevent CRC, and in some cases, treat established tumor (Geier, Butler, &amp; Howarth, 2006).  \n\nThe predominant species used as probiotic agents belong to the group of lactic acid \n\nbacteria (LAB). Due to their long history of safe use in foods, most species of LAB are considered \n\nas commensal microorganisms with no pathogenic potential (Chukeatirote, 2003). Within the \n\nLAB group, the genus Lactobacillus is the most widely encountered for probiotics (Chukeatirote, \n\n2003). L. acidophilus NCFM strain exhibits ability to reduce levels of free amines in the intestine, \n\nleading to a low risk of colon carcinoma (Goldin &amp; Gorbach, 1984). However, also here the \n\ncontroverse is present, for example, Shahani et al. (1980) observed that consumption of large \n\nquantities of fermented milk products containing Lactobacillus or Bifidobacteria were associated \n\nwith a lower incidence of CRC (Shahani &amp; Ayebo, 1980) although, other studies suggested that \n\nconsumption of fermented dairy products had little influence or no protection (Kampman, \n\nGoldbohm, van den Brandt, &amp; van 't Veer, 1994).  \n\nThe mechanisms by which probiotics may inhibit CRC are not yet fully characterized. The \n\nproduction of SCFAs is one key mechanism by which probiotics and prebiotics may impart \n\nbeneficial effects (Figure 4). Mattar et al. (2002) demonstrated that the addition of the probiotic \n\nLactobacillus casei GG (LGG) to the Caco-2 cells induced MUC-2 expression (responsible for the \n\nproduction of mucins of the intestine mucus layer) that correlated with LGG dosage. They \n\nsurmise that LGG may bind to specific receptor sites on the enterocyte and stimulate the up-\n\nregulation of MUC-2, resulting in increased inhibition of bacterial translocation (Mattar et al., \n\n2002). Ohkawara et al. (2005) investigated the bacterial strain Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens MDT-1 in \n\nthe context of CRC treatment as it produces high amounts of butyrate, a SCFA with well-known \n\napoptotic ability in cancer cells. In the 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced mouse model of colon \n\ncarcinoma, administration of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens MDT-1 led to a significant decrease in ACF, \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n15 \n \n\nand the number of mice with an increased proportion of aberrant crypts per foci was also \n\nreduced, indicating an inhibited progression of tumor development. This suggests that MDT-1 \n\nmay be a potential new probiotic with the ability to reduce the incidence of CRC (Ohkawara et al., \n\n2005).  \n\nThe genetic manipulation of probiotics is another area of research in the treatment of \n\nCRC, which can be a method to deliver important anti-neoplastic factors to the colon. Steidler et \n\nal. (2000) demonstrated that Lactococcus lactis genetically-engineered to produce the anti-\n\ninflammatory cytokine IL-10, reduced colonic inflammation in the dextran sulphate sodium model \n\nof colitis (Steidler et al., 2000). This study highlighted the potential for probiotics to be used as a \n\ndelivery system for anti-inflammatory or anti-tumorigenic substances which could help in the \n\nprevention or treatment of CRC (Geier et al., 2006). This is an important advance in the field of \n\ntreatment of CRC, as a probiotic strain could potentially be engineered to produce other \n\ncytokines. Castagliuolo et al. (2005) used a nonpathogenic strain of E. coli designed to deliver \n\nTGF-? genes to the colonic mucosa that successfully demonstrated to reduce the severity of \n\nexperimental colitis in mice (Castagliuolo et al., 2005). This strategy could also be beneficial in \n\nthe prevention of CRC, since TGF-? could be administered as an anti-proliferative factor, thus \n\nsuppressing tumor development (Geier et al., 2006). The use of this technology provides a mean \n\nby which probiotic strains can be tailored to deliver a wide array of therapeutic genes or factors \n\nincluding other anti-proliferative factors, or pro-apoptotic factors including anti-inflammatory \n\ncytokines (Geier et al., 2006). \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Propionibacteria \n\n \n\nAmong different dietary bacteria, the Propionibacterium form a genus, which is found in \n\nspecific dairy products (Mantere-Alhonen, 1995). Several experiments have shown that \n\npropionibacteria also possess probiotic characteristics when used alone or together with lactic \n\nacid and/or bifidobacteria (Mantere-Alhonen, 1995). Propionibacteria possess a peculiar \n\nfermentative metabolism which leads to the production of carbon dioxide and SCFA, such as \n\npropionate and acetate (Lan, Lagadic-Gossmann, Lemaire, Brenner, &amp; Jan, 2007). In the last \n\ndecades, several studies showed that the SCFA, namely acetate, propionate and butyrate, \n\ninduces apoptosis in CRC cells but not in normal cells (Tang, Chen, Jiang, &amp; Nie; Sakata 1987; \n\nSauer, Richter, &amp; Pool-Zobel, 2007). These results will be discussed later in this work. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n16 \n \n\nThe first time that the probiotic and growth promoting effect of pure propionibacteria was \n\nobserved was in a study made with piglets by Mantere-Alhonen, in 1982 (Mantere-Alhonen, \n\n1982). It was a rather large test material, thus the positive results of the feeding experiments \n\nshould be considered as statistically significant, and they prove the ability of propionibacteria to \n\nact as probiotics (Mantere-Alhonen, 1995). In 2002 Jan and Balzacq proposed that \n\npropionibacteria could constitute probiotics efficient in digestive cancer prophylaxis via their \n\nability to produce SCFA which induced apoptosis (Jan et al., 2002). Propionibacteria can survive \n\nin the human intestine and was found to induce apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells but not in \n\nnormal cells, at least in part, due to their specific property to produce propionate and acetate \n\n(Jan et al., 2002). \n\nImmerseel et al. (2010) suggested, that an ideal probiotic would be a colonizing \n\nbacterium that combines systemic anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects with delivery \n\nof high butyrate levels at the site of action and that can be ingested in a stable form, such as \n\nspores (Van Immerseel et al., 2010). These studies indicate that SCFA delivery via probiotic \n\ningestion may be an exciting new prevention/treatment option for CRC (Geier et al., 2006). \n\nThe possibility of using live propionibacteria in diet as preventive anti-cancer agents \n\nremains to be determined first by in vivo relevance of SCFA-based therapeutic strategy, and \n\nsecond by efficiently deliver SCFA to cancer cells (Lan et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n3.3. Symbiotics \n\n \n\nWhen prebiotics and probiotics are administered simultaneously, the combination is \n\ntermed symbiotics. Symbiotics have been proposed as a new preventive and therapeutic option.  \n\nThe mechanisms by which pro-, pre- and symbiotics may inhibit colon carcinoma are \n\nbeginning to be understood (Fotiadis et al., 2008).  The prebiotic in the symbiotic mixture \n\nimproves the survival of the probiotic bacteria and stimulates the activity of the host\u2019s \n\nendogenous bacteria (Mugambi, Musekiwa, Lombard, Young, &amp; Blaauw, 2012). Consumption of \n\nprobiotics and prebiotics together can increase the beneficial effects of each, since the stimulus \n\nof probiotic strains leads to selection of ideal symbiotic pairs (de Oliveira &amp; Aarestrup, 2012).  \n\nA human study has investigated the effect of an oligofrutose and inulin mixture together, \n\na product called \u2018Synergy\u2019 that combines short-chain oligofrutose and long-chain inulin with \n\nLactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 on biomarkers of cancer (Rafter et \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n17 \n \n\nal., 2007). The study involved a twelve week double blind placebo-controlled trial in patients with \n\ncancer and polypectomised individuals. The symbiotic intervention resulted in significant \n\nalterations in the composition of the colonic bacterial ecosystem, which presumably have \n\nconsequences for the metabolic activity of this organ. Colorectal cell proliferation and genotoxicity \n\nwere significantly reduced, and the intestinal barrier function increased (Rafter et al., 2007).  \n\nThe most important conclusion from Brady et al. (2000) is that in animals it appears to \n\nbe a synergistic effect of consumption of probiotic bacteria and prebiotics such as \n\nfructoligosaccharides on the attenuation of the development of CRC. The effect is often not large, \n\nbut it could be beneficial, in combination with other ways to reduce risk (Brady et al., 2000). For \n\nexample, in vitro studies only comprising prebiotics, the increase in acetic acid was reported to \n\nbe between two and six times higher as compared to controls and for butyric acid the highest \n\nconcentrations observed were four times higher as compared to control (van Zanten et al., \n\n2012). These increases in concentrations of acetic and butyric acids were however lower than \n\nthe increases observed for all symbiotic combinations investigated in van Zanten et al.

The association between diet, SCFA and colorectal carcinoma risk \n \n\nAlthough there is a strong genetic component in the development of colorectal adenomas \n\nor carcinomas, it is generally accepted that environmental factors including diet and lifestyle have \n\na major impact on risk (Azcarate-Peril, Sikes, &amp; Bruno-Barcena, 2011). Diet and nutrition are \n\nestimated to explain as much as 30-50% of the worldwide incidence of CRC and a high intake of \n\ncalories, fats, red meat and low consumption of fruits and vegetables are associated with the risk \n\nof CRC development (Cervi, 2005; Chan &amp; Giovannucci, 2010). It is believed that a proper diet \n\ncan prevent three to four million new cases per year (Gar\u00f3folo, 2004).  \n\nDietary fiber has been consumed for centuries and has been recognized as having health \n\nbenefits. The consumption of foods rich in this dietary component such as fresh vegetables and \n\nfruits, whole grains and nuts is associated with gastrointestinal benefits, such as increasing stool \n\nbulk and improving laxation (Schneeman, 1999). Despite all the benefits, Scharlau et al. (2009) \n\nreferred that human studies are not showing that fruit and vegetable intakes are associated with \n\na reduced cancer incidence in general and in particular with reduced CRC risk (Fuchs et al., \n\n1999; Scharlau et al., 2009). For example, Terry et al. (2001) results do not support the \n\nhypothesis that high consumption of cereal fiber decreases the risk of colon or rectal carcinoma, \n\neven based on a much broader range of cereal fiber intake than had been examined in previous \n\ncohort studies (Terry et al., 2001). However, it is also likely that the frequency of fruit and \n\nvegetables consumption that is adequate to decrease cancer risk, taking into account other \n\nhealth consequences, probably varies with individual factors and, perhaps, with other cofactors in \n\nthe population, such as multivitamin use and whether foods are fortified with other \n\nmicronutrients. In contrast, the role of diet in cancer development is strongly supported by \n\nepidemiological studies, in particular in the case of cancers of the digestive tract (Vano, \n\nRodrigues, &amp; Schneider, 2009). Topping and Clifton (2001) observed that some studies showed \n\nthat native East Africans, consuming a diet high in unrefined cereals, were at lower risk of CRC, \n\ndiverticular disease, and constipation than Europeans who ate a diet low in such foods (Topping \n\n&amp; Clifton, 2001). Another study by Bamia et al. (2013) allowed to conclude that adherence to \n\nMediterranean diet may be associated with lower CRC risk (Bamia et al., 2013) . The traditional \n\nMediterranean diet is characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruit/nuts, fish, cereals and \n\nlegumes, moderate alcohol consumption (particularly wine during meals), low to-moderate \n\nconsumption of dairy products (mainly cheese and yogurt) and low consumption of meat/meat \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n19 \n \n\nproducts (Trichopoulou &amp; Lagiou, 1997) . The main source of lipids is olive oil consumed in large \n\nquantities, and it is the main source of monounsaturated fatty acids in Mediterranean populations \n\n(Bamia et al., 2013). It has been suggested that up to 25% of colorectal carcinomas could be \n\nprevented by shifting to a Mediterranean diet (Trichopoulou, Lagiou, Kuper, &amp; Trichopoulos, \n\n2000). \n\nRegarding diet, resistant starch, a type of dietary fiber, has been hypothesized to have \n\nspecific anti-cancer properties since this form of fiber is preferentially fermented by microflora \n\ninto potentially beneficial SCFA in the colon (Chan &amp; Giovannucci, 2010). These SCFA produced \n\nfrom undigested dietary fibers in the human large intestine, have been extensively reported as \n\nantitumor agents that induce differentiation, growth arrest and apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells \n\n(Tang, Chen, Jiang, &amp; Nie, 2011a).  The most important role of SCFA in colonic physiology is \n\ntheir trophic effect on the intestinal epithelium. Sakata reported that the presence of SCFA in rat \n\ncolon stimulates mucosal proliferation (Sakata, 1987). In human, SCFAs production from inulin-\n\ntype fructan can increase the metabolic activity, pointing to trophic effects for normal colonocytes \n\n(Sauer, Richter, &amp; Pool-Zobel, 2007).  \n\nSCFA are organic fatty acids with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, increasing from acetic (C2:0), \n\npropionic (C3:0), butyric (C4:0), valeric (C5:0) and caproic (C6:0) acids (Fauser et al., 2011). \n\nThese intermediate carboxylic acids at the physiological pH predominate in their dissociated form \n\nacetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate and caproate are the principal anions which arise from \n\nbacterial fermentation of polysaccharide, oligosaccharide, protein, peptide, and glycoprotein \n\nprecursors in the colon (Bergman, 1990; Cummings &amp; Macfarlane, 1991; Miller &amp; Wolin, 1979). \n\nAmong these, however, butyrate, acetate, and propionate have been mainly emphasized. In \n\nparticular, butyrate was addressed to be more beneficial for promoting colonic health and more \n\neffective for stimulating the proliferation of intestinal mucosal cells than acetate and propionate \n\n(Sakata, 1987). These SCFA, especially butyrate, are recognized for their potential to act on \n\nsecondary chemoprevention by slowing growth and activating apoptosis in CRC cells. \n\nAdditionally, SCFA can also act on primary prevention by activation of different drug metabolizing \n\nenzymes. This can reduce the burden of carcinogens and, therefore, decrease the number of \n\nmutations, reducing cancer risk (Scharlau et al., 2009). \n\nResults from Takashi Sakata (1987) indicated that the stimulatory effect of SCFA on \n\nintestinal epithelial cell proliferation in vivo is substantial and highly reproducible, and that the \n\neffect of SCFA persists sufficiently long to be of nutritional significance (Sakata, 1987). When the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n20 \n \n\nconcentrations of SCFA used were compared with the lumen concentrations measured by Yang \n\net al. (1970), it was clear that physiological doses of acetate had a trophic effect on colonic \n\nepithelium, and butyrate had a trophic effect on both jejunal and colonic epithelium. In contrast, \n\npropionate was effective only at superphysiological doses (Sakata, 1987; Yang et al., 1970).  \n\nSeveral benefits can be obtained when the ingestion of dietary fibers are higher: \n\nincreases in SCFA result in decreased pH, which indirectly influences the composition of the \n\ncolonic microflora (eg, reduces potentially pathogenic clostridia when pH is more acidic), \n\ndecreases solubility of bile acids, increases absorption of minerals (indirectly), and reduces the \n\nammonia absorption by the protonic dissociation of ammonia and other amines (Wong et al., \n\n2006). \n\nBecause different types of dietary fiber produce varying amounts of the specific SCFA \n\n(Cummings, 1981), it is likely that the exact composition of fiber within the colonic lumen may \n\ndetermine its cellular effects, including its possible beneficial role in the prevention and/or \n\ntreatment of colon cancer (McIntyre, Gibson, &amp; Young, 1993). \n\n \n\n5. Colonic SCFA concentrations and carcinogenesis \n\n \n\nSCFA constitute approximately two-thirds of the colonic anion concentration (70-130 \n\nmmol/l), however, the rate and amount of SCFA produced depends on the species and amounts \n\nof microbiota present in the colon, the substrate source and gut transit time (Macfarlane &amp; \n\nMacfarlane, 2012; Mortensen &amp; Clausen, 1996). Total SCFA and local differences in SCFA \n\nconcentration along the intestinal track are implicated in diseases of the colon, especially in \n\ncancer and gastrointestinal disorders, where disease often occurs distally. Therefore, increased \n\nSCFA production and a greater delivery of SCFA distally may have a role in preventing these \n\ndiseases (Wong et al., 2006). \n\nIn vivo, the study of SCFA is more difficult and relies mostly on determination of the \n\nconcentrations in feces. The three main SCFA, butyrate, propionate and acetate, can be found in \n\nthe gut in considerably high concentrations. These concentrations range from 40\u201380mM, 10\u2013\n\n25mM and 10\u201320mM for acetate, propionate and butyrate, respectively (Alles et al., 1999; \n\nJenkins et al., 1999; Topping &amp; Clifton, 2001). The relative molar proportions range from 50\u2013\n\n65% for acetate, from 10\u201325% for propionate and from 10\u201325% for butyrate, depending on the \n\nfiber consumed (Alles et al., 1999; Jenkins et al., 1999; Topping &amp; Clifton, 2001). Nonetheless, \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n21 \n \n\nthe in vitro production of total colonic SCFA is difficult to determine because more than 95% of \n\nthe SCFAs are rapidly absorbed (Roy et al., 2006) and metabolized by the host (Cook &amp; Sellin, \n\n1998; Topping &amp; Clifton, 2001).  \n\nSCFA absorption rates are the same in all the regions of the colon, but as the \n\nconcentrations of fermentation substrates are highest in the cecum and ascending colon, the \n\nconcentration of SCFA decreases from the proximal to the distal colon (Roy et al., 2006). In the \n\ngut, butyrate is the major energy source for colonocytes (Ahmad et al., 2000), propionate is \n\nlargely taken up by the liver and acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by \n\nperipheral tissues (Wong et al., 2006).   \n\n \n\n6. Effects of SCFA in CRC cells \n \n\nA variety of biological effects of SCFA have been reported, and there is a vast number of \n\nexperimental works showing new aspects of these molecules.   \n\nAlthough most studies focus on SCFA-induced apoptosis, Tang and co-workers demonstrated for \n\nthe first time that butyrate and propionate are able to induce autophagy in human colon cancer \n\ncells (Tang et al., 2011a). Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process in which \n\nthe cytoplasmic contents and organelles are transferred into double membrane vesicles, called \n\nautophagosomes (Glick, Barth, &amp; Macleod, 2010). Autophagosome ultimately fuses with a \n\nlysosome, where its contents are broken down by degradative enzymes and subsequently \n\nrecycled (Glick et al., 2010). This mechanism of type II Programed Cell Death (Tang et al., \n\n2011a), is responsible for the turnover of intracellular long-lived proteins and damaged organelles \n\nduring cellular homeostasis. Autophagy plays also important roles in tissue development, \n\ndifferentiation and remodeling (B. Levine &amp; Klionsky, 2004) and has been implicated in tumor \n\ndevelopment. In Tang et al. (2011a) in vitro study, human colon carcinoma cells were treated \n\nwith propionate and butyrate at concentrations (1\u20133 mM) below their IC50 (half maximal inhibitory \n\nconcentration) value toward the cancer cells and instead of inducing apoptosis, these SCFA \n\ninduced extensive morphological alterations characteristics of autophagy. Consequently, the \n\ninduced autophagy may provide tumor cells with an alternative energy supply to allow for \n\nadaptive protein synthesis and help overcome mitochondria defects causing a cellular energy \n\ncrisis. Autophagic degradation of defective mitochondria could retard the occurrence of apoptosis \n\nby circumventing the release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c from the mitochondria \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n22 \n \n\nand the activation of the apoptotic caspase cascade. The results presented in their study suggest \n\nthat induced autophagy by SCFAs would increase the resistance and flexibility of colon carcinoma \n\ntoward an adverse microenvironment and compromise the efficacy of SCFAs themselves in colon \n\ncarcinoma prevention (Tang et al., 2011a).  \n\nTherefore, SCFA may have opposing effects either inducing autophagy and hence \n\nincreasing cell resistance, or inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells through induction of \n\napoptosis. In line of this latter effect we have recently demonstrated that lysosomal membrane \n\npermebilization (LMP) and the release of Cat-D is important in regulation of apoptosis by acetate \n\n(Marques et al., 2013) (Figure 5). An extensive revision was performed concerning the precise \n\nrole of SCFA: butyrate, propionate and acetate in colorectal carcinoma and all data was compiled \n\nin Table I, and will be described in brief.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n23 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - Schematic representation of the proposed role of SCFAs in orchestrating two opposing cellular events: \n\ninduction of autophagy which increases tumor resistance and contributes to its development or induction of \n\napoptosis which increases tumor sensitivity and promotes elimination of colon cancer cells.

Butyrate \n \n\nOf all SCFA butyrate is the most extensively studied because of its role in the prevention \n\nof CRC, inducing a variety of changes within the nucleus as a consequence of inhibition of cell \n\ndifferentiation, promotion of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of transformed colonocytes (Heerdt, \n\nHouston, &amp; Augenlicht, 1997). Hinnebusch et al. (2002) demonstrated that apoptosis levels in \n\nhuman colon carcinoma cells were higher for treatment with butyrate than with other SCFA \n\n(Hinnebusch et al., 2002). On the other hand, Marques et al. (2013) showed that acetate \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n24 \n \n\ninduces high levels of apoptosis in CRC cells (Marques et al., 2013).  Butyrate presents the same \n\neffects in other types of malignant cells both in vitro and in vivo (Table 1).  \n\nButyrate is a major energy source for colonic epithelial cells in vivo, accounting for about \n\n70-90% of total energy consumption (Cook &amp; Sellin, 1998; G. R. Gibson &amp; Roberfroid, 1995; \n\nScheppach, 1994), while most other cell types use glucose (Donohoe et al., 2011), and is \n\nthought to stimulate cell proliferation (Scheppach et al., 1992). Cells that metabolize butyrate at \n\na higher rate are likely to be less susceptible to its apoptosis-inducing effects, which may explain \n\nwhy normal colonocytes are unaffected by the very high levels of this SCFA in the distal colon \n\n(Medina et al., 1997). However, an important conclusion from Singh et al. (1997) study was that \n\nthe response of colonic epithelial cells to butyrate may depend in part on the other energy \n\nsources available to the epithelium: in conditions of low energy availability, butyrate could \n\nstimulate growth, but in the presence of high levels of alternative high energy sources such as \n\nglucose, butyrate could switch from a growth stimulator to a growth inhibitor and/or an inducer \n\nof apoptosis, depending upon factors such as the level of exposure and the intracellular milieu \n\n(Sengupta, Muir, &amp; Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 1997). Nevertheless, differentiation of \n\ncolonocytes, either induced by butyrate or by other conditions, is reversible at early times of \n\nexposure. It has been hypothesized that less differentiated transformed cells are more sensitive \n\nto the apoptotic effects of butyrate than differentiated colonocytes (Matthews, Howarth, &amp; Butler, \n\n2006; Scharlau et al., 2009). Thus, if a continuous in vivo exposure to high concentrations of \n\nbutyrate is not attained, the irreversible commitment to differentiation might not occur and cells \n\ncould return to their normal malignant phenotype and regain the capacity to proliferate (Cai et al., \n\n2006).  \n\nBoren and et al. (2003) observed that differences exist in the metabolism of butyrate \n\nbetween a butyrate-sensitive (HT29) and a butyrate-resistant (MIA) cell types. Incubation of MIA \n\ncells with butyrate had no effect on glucose utilization and was not associated with cellular \n\ndifferentiation (Boren et al., 2003). It was, therefore, proposed that a cell will undergo apoptosis \n\nor differentiation depending on the ability of that cell to metabolize butyrate. However, cancer \n\ncells that are capable of metabolize butyrate have been identified (Lopez de Silanes et al., 2004) \n\nand they are protected against its role as an apoptotic inducer. This finding suggests that the \n\ncolonic butyrate-rich microenvironment may play a role in the selection of more aggressive colon \n\ncarcinoma cells that maintain the ability to use butyrate as a carbon and energy source (Serpa et \n\nal., 2010). Additionally, several studies showed that butyrate-resistant cancer cells may be \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n25 \n \n\nselected and give rise to more aggressive cancers (Chai, Evdokiou, Young, &amp; Zalewski, 2000; \n\nLopez de Silanes et al., 2004; Mariadason, Corner, &amp; Augenlicht, 2000).  \n\nOther studies propose a down regulation of butyrate transporters, such as MCT1, in \n\nhuman colon carcinoma tissue (Lambert, Wood, Ellis, &amp; Shirazi-Beechey, 2002; H. Li et al., \n\n2003) which results in a reduced uptake and metabolism of butyrate in the colonocytes (Hamer \n\net al., 2008). A decline in the abundance of MCT1 in the membrane of colonic epithelial cells, \n\nand hence in butyrate uptake, would in turn reduce the availability of intracellular butyrate as a \n\nsource of energy and as an important regulator of cellular homeostasis. In 2009 Thangaraju et \n\nal. showed that butyrate also elicits effects in colon cells extracellularly by serving as a ligand for \n\nGPR109A (Thangaraju et al., 2009), a receptor in the lumen facing apical membrane of colonic \n\nepithelial cells that binds butyrate with low affinity (Clarke et al., 2012). The expression of \n\nGPR109A is silenced in colon carcinoma by DNA methylation whereas its re-expression by \n\nbutyrate exposure in cancer cells results in apoptosis without the involvement of histone \n\ndeacetylases (HDAC) (Thangaraju et al., 2009). Butyrate was also able to activate the receptor \n\nwith an EC50 (concentration necessary for half-maximal activation of the receptor) of ?1.6 \n\nmmol/L. Although the levels of butyrate in circulation are too low (?5 ?mol/L) to activate the \n\nreceptor, butyrate is present at high levels (?20 mmol/L) in colonic lumen (Hamer et al., 2008). \n\nIf GPR109A is expressed in the lumen-facing apical membrane of colonocytes, it might suggest \n\nthat the ability of butyrate to prevent cancer and inflammation in the colon may also be mediated \n\nextracellularly via the receptor without entering into cells (Thangaraju et al., 2009). Still regarding \n\nto transporters, the gene of the SMCT1 transporter is highly methylated in colon adenomas of \n\nAfrican Americans, who are more likely to die from colon carcinoma than others, which points to \n\nits potential use as a marker for early detection (Brim et al., 2011). Re-expression of SMCT1 in \n\nthe presence of butyrate results in colon carcinoma cellular apoptosis (Brim et al., 2011). \n\nThangaraju (2008) observed that the induction of apoptosis in SW480 colon cancer cells by \n\nSMCT1/butyrate was associated with upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes (p53, Bax, Bad, Bak, \n\nFAS ligand, FAS receptor, TRAIL, and TRAIL receptors) and downregulation of anti-apoptotic \n\ngenes (Bcl-2, Bcl-W, BclxL, Bfl-1, and survivin) (Thangaraju et al., 2008). Butyrate causes cell \n\ndeath in colon carcinoma cells by two independent but complementary mechanisms: one \n\nthrough GPR109A independent of HDACs and other through SMCT1-mediated entry of butyrate \n\ninto cells with subsequent inhibition of HDACs (Thangaraju et al., 2009). By acting as an HDAC \n\ninhibitor, butyrate leads to histone hyperacetylation (Cousens, Gallwitz, &amp; Alberts, 1979) and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n26 \n \n\nenhances the accessibility of transcription factors to the DNA, causing biological effects in colon \n\ncarcinoma cells (Wong et al., 2006), including cell death (Shao et al., 2004). \n\nFor Donohoe and co-workers (2012) butyrate inhibits the growth of cancerous \n\ncolonocytes because it is metabolized inefficiently due to the Warburg effect, described as a high \n\ndegree of aerobic glycolysis. Consequently, butyrate accumulates in the nucleus, acts as an \n\nHDAC inhibitor and causes cell death (Shao et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2006). Robert Li and Cong \n\nJun Li (2006) confirmed the accumulation of acetylated histone 3 (H3) due to butyrate treatment \n\n(R. W. Li &amp; Li, 2006). In addition to this function, butyrate increases histone acetylation through \n\nconversion to acetyl-CoA and stimulating histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (Barshishat, Polak-\n\nCharcon, &amp; Schwartz) activity (R. W. Li &amp; Li, 2006). However, the metabolic state of the cell \n\ninfluences intranuclear butyrate and acetyl-CoA levels and determines whether butyrate functions \n\nto inhibit HDACs or stimulate HATs to epigenetically regulate the expression of different target \n\ngenes (Donohoe et al., 2012). Deregulation in the expression or activity of HATs and HDACs may \n\nlead to alterations in gene expression profiles, associated with the reactivation or silencing of \n\ngenes critical for cancer progression, differentiation and apoptosis (Iacomino, Tecce, Grimaldi, \n\nTosto, &amp; Russo, 2001; Marchion &amp; Munster, 2007; Sambucetti et al., 1999). For example, \n\nhyperacetylation of histones can support chromatin opening and induction of p21 (WAF1/CIP1) \n\ngene expression (Davie, 2003), and increased histone acetylation in the promoter of p21WAF1 gene \n\nhas been reported after butyrate treatment. Activation of tumor-suppressor genes, like p21WAF1, is \n\nclaimed to be the major cause of growth arrest and/or apoptosis. On the other hand, down \n\nregulation of p21WAF1 expression in colorectal carcinomas is associated with histone \n\nhypoacetylation of total chromatin (Lu et al., 2008). It is possible, that nucleosome conformations \n\nare altered due to histone H3 hypoacetylation, and that the access to chromatin of transcriptional \n\nregulatory proteins may be reduced in colorectal carcinomas (Lu et al., 2008). It has also been \n\nreported that butyrate can induce a hypermethylation of DNA (de Haan, Gevers, &amp; Parker, 1986), \n\ncontributing to repression of the transcription of a specific region of DNA. Still regarding to DNA \n\nmolecules, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a hydrolase isoenzyme responsible for removing \n\nphosphate groups nucleotides, and their levels are frequently elevated in patients with metastatic \n\nCRC (Saif, Alexander, &amp; Wicox, 2005). ALP activity and the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV have been \n\nused as markers of colonocyte differentiation in many studies with Caco-2 and HT29 colon \n\ncarcinoma cells and were increased during culture of malignant cells in the presence of butyrate \n\n(Whitehead, Young, &amp; Bhathal, 1986). Regarding transcription, it has been demonstrated that \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n27 \n \n\ntranscriptional attenuation triggered by butyrate plays an important role in the down regulation of \n\ntwo key genes that regulate colonic cell maturation and transformation \u2013 c-myc and cyclin D1, \n\nand therefore eliminate their increased steady state levels, which might be expected from the \n\nelevation in Wnt signaling (Cai et al., 2006; Maier et al., 2009). Scharlau et al. (2009) also \n\nobserved that butyrate treatment enhanced mRNA gene expression, protein expression and \n\nenzyme activity of GSTs, and other stress response genes in human primary colon cells, LT97 \n\ncells and HT29 cells (Scharlau et al., 2009). In response to DNA damage, p53 is activated and \n\nturns on the transcription of one of its downstream genes, p21WAF1 (Archer, Meng, Shei, &amp; Hodin, \n\n1998; el-Deiry et al., 1993). For Harper et al. (1993) the p21WAF1 product binds to cyclin \n\ncomplexes and inhibits the function of cyclin-dependent kinases (Harper et al., 1993). Nakano et \n\nal (1997) found that butyrate markedly induces p21WAF1protein and causes G1-phase arrest. They \n\nalso observed that butyrate can strongly activate the WAF1/CIP1 promoter, and that the two p53-\n\nbinding sites are not required for the transcriptional activation by butyrate (Nakano et al., 1997). \n\nBy inhibiting the HDAC activity recruited to the p21WAF1 promoter by Sp1 or Sp3, butyrate induces \n\nthe expression of p21WAF1 and thereby stops cell proliferation (Davie, 2003). Nakano et al (1997) \n\nsuggested that butyrate-induced growth arrest in human colon carcinoma cells is due to the p53-\n\nindependent activation of p21 promoter mediated through specific Sp1 sites in the promoter \n\nregion (Nakano et al., 1997). Siavoshian et al. (2000) showed that exposure to butyrate resulted \n\nin arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and that was associated with p21WAF1 induction at the \n\nprotein and mRNA level and overexpression of cyclin D3 (Siavoshian et al., 2000). Regarding cell \n\ncycle progression, Robert Li and Cong Jun Li (2006) observed that MDBK cells (Madin-Darby \n\nbovine kidney epithelial cells) were arrested at the G1/S boundary and DNA replication was \n\nblocked after butyrate treatment (R. W. Li &amp; Li, 2006). A different study showed that after 6 hours \n\nfollowing treatment of CRC cells with 5 mM of butyrate, the percentage of cells in G1 phase of \n\nthe cell cycle increased by 40% (Maier et al., 2009). Another gene that is regulated by p53 and \n\nthat could influence the decision to commit to an apoptotic pathway is Bax, which belongs to Bcl-\n\n2 family. It is known that members of the Bcl-2 family play important roles in regulating apoptosis \n\nby functioning as promoters (e.g. Bax, Bak, and Bok) or inhibitors (e.g. Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, A1, and \n\nMcl-1) of cell death of transformed cells (Carpinelli et al., 2012; Gewies, 2003; Tzifi et al., 2012). \n\nIt is also known that overexpression of Bcl-2 can block p53-mediated apoptosis (A. J. Levine, \n\n1997). Bax binds to Bcl-2 and antagonizes its ability to block apoptosis so a p53-dependent Bax \n\nsynthesis could tip the scales toward apoptosis (A. J. Levine, 1997). Hague et al. (1996) \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n28 \n \n\nsuggested that Bcl-2 and Bak play a pivotal role in sodium-butyrate-induced apoptosis in colonic \n\nepithelial cell and that overexpression of Bcl-2 does not protect against Bak-mediated apoptosis \n\n(Hague et al., 1996). Zhang et al. (2010) observed that there is a decrease of Bcl-2 (anti-\n\napoptotic protein) expression in a dose-dependent manner following butyrate treatment in human \n\ncolon carcinoma cells, and also a dose-dependent increase of Bax with increase of butyrate \n\nconcentration (Zhang et al., 2010). The ratio between Bax and Bcl-2 determines the cells\u2019 \n\nsurvival or death. A decrease in the levels of Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax leads to the loss of \n\nmitochondrial transmembrane potential, a key event in the induction of apoptosis. Their results \n\nindicate that the treatment of butyrate leads to a shift from an anti-apoptotic to a pro-apoptotic \n\nstate (Zhang et al., 2010). Chirakall et al. (2006) showed that butyrate induces apoptosis through \n\nupregulation of Bak. Their data strongly suggest that Bak upregulation is mediated through \n\nincreased Sp3 binding at the promoter region rather than Sp1 binding, which decreased after \n\ntreatment with butyrate. They also observed increased Bak and reduced Bcl-xL in response to \n\nsub-apoptotic concentrations of butyrate (Chirakkal et al., 2006).  \n\nConcerning grow and spread of CRC, Neuropilin (NRP)-1 is a member of the VEGF \n\nreceptor family in colon carcinoma, and high levels of NRP-1 staining in human colorectal \n\ncarcinoma tissues is associated in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis and in decreased \n\napoptosis (Ochiumi et al., 2006). Yu et al. (2010) data show that different CRC cells exposed to \n\nbutyrate down-regulate NRP-1 expression through decreased mRNA production leading to \n\nreduction in protein levels. Modification of Sp family activity by butyrate, and the potential of NRP-\n\n1 as a Sp1 target led Yu et al. to investigate the ability of butyrate to modulate NP-1 expression, \n\nwith a view to providing an alternative therapy or chemopreventive strategy for colon carcinoma, \n\nas NRP-1 is involved in both angiogenesis and the prevention of apoptosis in CRC. Their data \n\nsuggest two potential mechanisms for chemoprevention - through the apoptotic regulatory \n\nfunction of NRP-1 and through its pro-angiogenic role (Yu et al., 2010) . \n\nColon carcinoma cells can also acquire mechanisms to escape CD95-mediated \n\napoptosis (Fan et al., 1999). Fan et al. (1999) demonstrated that butyrate exposure selectively \n\ninduces expression of CD95-L and CD95, which means that butyrate stimulation of colonic \n\napoptosis is mediated by this death receptor (Fan et al., 1999). Because caspases are the \n\nexecutioners of apoptosis, they are considered the key players in apoptotic cell death (Park et al., \n\n2007). Butyrate treatment induced apoptosis by activation of caspase-9 (Zhang et al., 2010) and \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n29 \n \n\ncaspase-3 (Ramos et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2010) through the mitochondria cytochrome c-\n\nmediated apoptotic pathway (Shao et al., 2004).  \n\nA common characteristic of the majority of CRCs is the constitutive activation of the \n\ncanonical Wnt signaling pathway. Bordonaro et al. (1999) reported that butyrate hyper-induces \n\ncanonical Wnt transcriptional activity in CRC cells (Bordonaro et al., 1999) and that there is a \n\nrelationship between enhanced Wnt activity and higher levels of apoptosis (Bordonaro, Lazarova, \n\n&amp; Sartorelli, 2008). Later (2007), Bordonaro et al. observed that colon carcinoma cells with \n\nmutations in components of the canonical Wnt signaling hyper-induce this pathway in the \n\npresence of butyrate (Bordonaro et al., 2007). They had previously identified, on ten human CRC \n\ncell lines with different Wnt signaling mutations, two classes of CRC cell lines: those which \n\nrespond to butyrate treatment with a high fold induction of canonical Wnt activity and apoptosis, \n\nand those which exhibit a relatively lower fold induction of canonical Wnt activity and apoptosis. \n\nThis could happen also in vivo: there may be CRC subtypes that respond to butyrate with hyper-\n\ninduction of canonical Wnt signaling and high levels of apoptosis, as well as CRC subtypes that \n\nrespond with a lower fold induction of canonical Wnt activity and apoptosis (Bordonaro et al., \n\n2008; Lazarova, Bordonaro, Carbone, &amp; Sartorelli, 2004). The fact that only a subtype of colonic \n\ncarcinomas cells responds to butyrate with hyper-activation of Wnt signaling and enhanced \n\napoptosis is probably the reason why some epidemiological studies are inconsistent about the \n\nassociation between fiber intake and colon carcinoma. Lazarova et al. (2004) suggested that \n\nexposure to butyrate may be most beneficial for those malignancies in which butyrate is able to \n\ninduce relatively high levels of Wnt activity that lead to apoptosis (Lazarova et al., 2004). Even \n\nthough several studies of butyrate in animal models have demonstrated a protective effect of \n\nbutyrate on colorectal carcinogenesis, the same role of butyrate on carcinogenesis in humans is \n\nstill difficult to understand. Again, Bordonaro et al. (2008) believe that the inconsistent findings in \n\nthe literature on the protective role of dietary fiber and its degradation product butyrate against \n\ncolon carcinoma can be at least partially explained by: (a) the existence of different subtypes of \n\ncolonic neoplasms that differ in the induction of canonical Wnt signaling and apoptosis in \n\nresponse to butyrate; (b) variations in colonic microflora that generate different levels of butyrate \n\nby fermentation of dietary fiber; and (c) the timing of exposure of colonic cells to fiber/butyrate in \n\nrelation to the specific stage of colonic tumorigenesis (Bordonaro et al., 2008). \n\n Another pathway that has been shown to contribute to cancer proliferation and survival \n\nis the PI3K signaling pathway (Wang, Li, Wang, Kim, &amp; Evers, 2002). Activation of PI3K, a down-\n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n30 \n \n\nregulator of the RAS signaling pathway, is necessary for actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, which \n\nis associated with the transformed phenotype, and is increased in 86% of human CRCs (Phillips, \n\nSt Clair, Munday, Thomas, &amp; Mitchell, 1998). Wang et al. (2002) showed that PI3K inhibition \n\nenhances apoptosis induced by butyrate in the aggressive human colon carcinoma cell line, \n\nKM20, and in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (Wang et al., 2002). \n\n Butyrate has also anti-inflammatory activity in colon adenocarcinoma cells mediated by \n\ninhibition of the NF-?B pathway (Tedelind, Westberg, Kjerrulf, &amp; Vidal, 2007). NF-?B regulates \n\ngenes involved in controlling cell proliferation, cell death, immune response, and inflammatory \n\nresponses (Luhrs et al., 2001; Segain et al., 2000; Yin, Laevsky, &amp; Giardina, 2001)  and it has \n\nbeen suggested that blocking NF-?B can cause tumor cells to stop proliferating, die, or become \n\nmore sensitive to the action of anti-tumor agents (Garg &amp; Aggarwal, 2002). Kaler et al. (2008) \n\nshowed that in intestinal epithelial cells, butyrate activity modulates signaling by a major pro \n\ninflammatory cytokine, the tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF?). Epithelial cells with k-RAS sensitizes \n\ncells to HDACi induced apoptosis. Kaler et al. (2008) demonstrated that butyrate interfered with \n\nTNF?-induced NF-?B activity in colon carcinoma cell lines (HCT116 and Hke3 cells), and that \n\nthis activity of butyrate was unaffected by the presence of a mutant K-RAS (Kaler, 2008) \n\nZhang et al. (2010) analyzed the roles of MAPKs - ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPKs, as \n\nthey play central roles in the signaling pathways of cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. \n\nButyrate induced apoptosis in the RKO human colorectal carcinoma cell line via activation of the \n\nJNK MAPK pathway. In addition, inactivation of ERK MAPK was involved in butyrate-induced \n\ngrowth inhibition of RKO cells (Zhang et al., 2010). \n\nAlthough the aforementioned studies demonstrate that butyrate has apoptotic properties, \n\ncontradictory results exist. One important reason for the opposite effects of butyrate when tested \n\nin vitro vs in vivo may be the different conditions that exist in these two systems, such as: (a) \n\ndifferences between in vitro and in vivo experimental environments, (b) timing of butyrate \n\nadministration with respect to tumor development, (c) amount of butyrate utilized in the \n\nexperiments, (d) effects of fiber that are independent of butyrate production (e.g., fecal transit \n\ntime, fecal bulk, and other bioactive agents present in the fiber), and (e) interaction of fiber with \n\ndietary fats (e.g., the complementary action of fish oil and pectin in suppressing intestinal \n\ntumorigenesis) (Bordonaro et al., 2008; Lupton, 2004). \n\nThe global conclusion is that colonocyte-exposure to butyrate in the gut lumen of humans \n\ncould be protective by reducing survival of transformed colon cells, while at the same time \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n31 \n \n\npromoting survival of non-transformed colonocytes (Scharlau et al., 2009). It must be \n\nremembered that butyrate is not available as a sole compound but probably acts in unison with \n\nother metabolites of dietary fiber and of the faecal gut flora. In this context the new approaches to \n\ninvestigate complete gut fermentation samples are of importance, since they self-evidently better \n\nreflect in vivo exposure conditions than butyrate alone (Scharlau et al., 2009).  \n\nDespite all findings of the benefic effects of butyrate, there is an unresolved paradox \n\nconcerning the putative protective role of this SCFA in colon carcinoma: CRCs still develop and \n\ngrow despite the high concentrations of butyrate in the colon (Serpa et al., 2010).  \n\n \n\n6.2. Propionate \n \n\nThe number of published studies regarding propionate is by far lower than butyrate. \n\nAlthough propionate is less frequently studied it has the same health-promoting properties. \n\nPropionate like butyrate exerts an antiproliferative effect towards colon carcinoma cells (Hosseini, \n\nGrootaert, Verstraete, &amp; Van de Wiele, 2011). Propionate not only adds to butyrate\u2019s effect of \n\nsuppressing cell growth, but also to butyrate\u2019s effect of modulating histone acetylation in human \n\ncolon cells (Hosseini et al., 2011) . Based on these observations it can be speculated that the \n\nproducts of complex in vitro fiber fermentation, like propionate, may contribute to in vivo tumour \n\nsuppressor agent activities resulting in the inhibition of tumor progression (Kiefer, Beyer-\n\nSehlmeyer, &amp; Pool-Zobel, 2006).  \n\nJan et al. (2002) showed that propionate induces typical signs of apoptosis in human \n\ncolorectal carcinoma cell lines, with loss of mitochondrial trans-membrane potential, generation \n\nof reactive oxygen species, caspase-3-processing and nuclear chromatin condensation (Jan et al., \n\n2002). \n\nBindels et al. (2012) demonstrated that, the anti-proliferative effect of propionate was \n\npartially cAMP level-dependent and associated with the activation of free fatty acid receptor 2 \n\n(FFA2, a G-protein-coupled receptor, also known as GPR43) (Bindels et al., 2012). The authors \n\nargue that the pharmacological activation of FFA2 may be of therapeutic interest to control \n\ncancer cell proliferation and sustain the idea of a role for gut microbiota in the control of systemic \n\ncancer. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) negatively regulates autophagy and Tang et \n\nal (2011) demonstrated that propionate-induced autophagy was associated with decreased \n\nmTOR activity and enhanced AMP kinase activity  (Tang et al., 2011a).   \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n32 \n \n\n6.3. Acetate \n \n\nA study by Barcenilla et al. (2000) revealed that 95% of intestinal isolated bacterial \n\nstrains utilizing acetate were butyrate producers. This suggests that butyrate production by \n\nbacteria is heavily dependent on the availability of acetate (Barcenilla et al., 2000). Hence the \n\nactivities of acetate producing bacteria which influence the availability of acetate can play a \n\nsignificant role in colonic health as rate-limiting steps in butyrate formation (Abell, Conlon, &amp; \n\nMcorist, 2006). Acetate induces cell proliferation arrest of intestinal epithelial cells in a \n\nconcentration and pH dependent manner (Matsuki et al.). Jan et al. (2002) showed that acetate, \n\nat levels of 9\u201316 mmol/L, induced typical signs of apoptosis in human colorectal carcinoma cell \n\nlines. Like with propionate, this effect included a loss of mitochondrial trans-membrane potential, \n\nthe generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspase-3-processing and nuclear chromatin \n\ncondensation. Accordingly Marques et al. (2013) observed that acetate per se induces apoptosis \n\nin CRC-derived cell lines HCT-15 and RKO, by inducing DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, \n\nphosphatidylserine exposure to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and the appearance of \n\na sub-G1 population (Marques et al., 2013) .    \n\nAlthough cancer cells may block classical apoptotic pathways, cell death can still occur \n\nthrough the release of lysosomal enzymes (Kirkegaard &amp; Jaattela, 2009). Recently, Marques et \n\nal. (2013) showed that Cat D was release to the cytosol in two CRC lines undergoing acetate-\n\ninduced apoptosis. These results indicate that acetate induces a lysosomal apoptotic pathway \n\n(Marques et al., 2013). Currently, lysosomal pathway of apoptosis is a widely accepted concept \n\nas partial lysosomal permeabilization with subsequent release of proteolytic enzymes into the \n\ncytosol, contributing to the death pathways, has been described in several models of apoptosis. \n\nThe magnitude of lysosomal permeabilization determines the type of cell death mediated by \n\nlysosomal enzymes: a complete breakdown of the organelle with release of lysosomal enzymes \n\nattaining high cytosolic concentration results in unregulated necrosis, while partial, selective \n\npermeabilization triggers apoptosis (Guicciardi, Leist, &amp; Gores, 2004). Among the released \n\nenzymes, cathepsins are of particular interest, since these molecules are often overexpressed in \n\nhuman cancers, and high expression levels have been associated with increased risk of relapse \n\nand poor prognosis. In contrast to their tumor promoting effects, there is also evidence that they \n\nfunction as tumor suppressors (Marques et al., 2013). There are several human cathepsins \n\nidentified, but the most relevant are the cysteine cathepsins B and L (Cat B and Cat L) and the \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n33 \n \n\nonly lysosomal aspartic protease, cathepsin D (Cat D). Cat D has been implicated in apoptosis \n\ninduced by staurosporine (Bidere et al., 2003) (Johansson, Steen, Ollinger, &amp; Roberg, 2003), \n\ninterferon-g, Fas/CD95/APO-1 and TNF-a (Deiss, Galinka, Berissi, Cohen, &amp; Kimchi, 1996) \n\n(Demoz et al., 1999), oxidative stress (Roberg, Johansson, &amp; Ollinger, 1999) sphingosine \n\n(Kagedal, Zhao, Svensson, &amp; Brunk, 2001), and p53 (Wu, Saftig, Peters, &amp; El-Deiry, 1998) and \n\nrecently, as referred, by acetate (Marques et al., 2013). In our model Cat D seems to have a \n\nprotective role in acetate-induced apoptosis which can have important prevention/therapeutic \n\nimplications. The protective role of Cat D demonstrated by our data might partly explain why Cat \n\nD is overexpressed in some CRC clinical cases in comparison to normal colon mucosa.

Combined effects of SCFA \n \n\nThere are very few studies with the combination of SCFA. In Matthews et al. (2012) \n\nstudy, butyrate alone, and the combination of butyrate and propionate treatment, reduced Caco-2 \n\ncell viability and induced significantly greater apoptosis than propionate alone. This suggests that \n\ndistinct SCFA exert significantly different effects on cell viability that may be due to differences in \n\ntheir absorption, metabolism and/or ability to induce histone acetylation. Their study also showed \n\nthat further separation of apoptosis into early and late apoptosis indicated that SCFA increase \n\nboth phases of apoptosis, although butyrate alone and the combination of SCFA led to a greater \n\nextent compared to propionate alone (Matthews, Howarth, &amp; Butler, 2012). Jan and co-workers \n\nobserved that propionate and acetate-induced apoptosis in HT-29 cell occurred via the \n\nstereotyped biochemical events, including mitochondrial alterations, caspase activation and \n\nnuclear degradation (Jan et al., 2002). Lan et al. (2007) observed that propionate and acetate \n\nproduced by propionibacteria triggered apoptosis induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase prior to \n\napoptosis at pH 7.5 in HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Lan et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n7. Colorectal Carcinoma \u2013 SCFA prevention and/or therapy?  \n \n\nThe mainstay of CRC prevention is screening and detection of adenomatous polyps. CRC \n\nis an active area of scientific research, and studies range from cancer prevention and early \n\ndetection to treatment. Cancer chemoprevention is characterized by the use of natural, synthetic, \n\nor biological (from a living source) substances to reverse, suppress, or prevent the development \n\nof cancer (Wattenberg, 1985). Epigenetic mechanisms by their potential reversibility represent \n\ninteresting targets in CRC for chemopreventive approaches using dietary agents. Accumulating \n\nevidence suggests that natural molecules/nutrients present in our diet might modulate epigenetic \n\nevents in humans (Schnekenburger &amp; Diederich, 2012). \n\n Jan et al. (2002) proposed that propionibacteria could constitute probiotics efficient in \n\nthe prophylaxis of digestive cancer via their ability to produce apoptosis-inducing SCFA. They \n\nreport that different strains and species of propionibacteria kill cancer cells via the metabolic \n\nproduction of two SCFA, propionate and acetate (Jan et al., 2002). All three major components of \n\nshort-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate and acetate) induce apoptosis and inhibit cell \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n39 \n \n \n\nproliferation. However, several studies show that butyrate is the most potent in inducing \n\napoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation in CRC (C. J. Li &amp; Elsasser, 2005). \n\nDetermining which chemopreventive agents arise in the diet is fundamental to identify \n\nmore effective strategies for cancer prevention and therapy (Tang et al., 2011b). Schnekenburger \n\nand Diederich (2012) suggested that improved early cancer detection and dietary intervention are \n\npreventive approaches of choice to decrease CRC incidence (Schnekenburger &amp; Diederich, \n\n2012).  \n\n \n\n8. Conclusions \n \n\nIt is known that chemotherapy and radiotherapy operate based on, for example, a \n\nmechanism of induction of apoptosis in cancer cells by altering their metabolism. It is also known \n\nthat if a cancer has an inoperative P53, which regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis, due to an \n\ninactivating mutation, it makes no sense to administer a drug to the patient whose mechanism of \n\naction is dependent on that molecule. Cancer should be analyzed for their molecular profile, \n\nidentifying the main oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes mutated as the majority of patients \n\nare treated only based in the evaluation of cancer development, and following protocols \n\nestablished in the hospitals depending on the stage. Patients should be treated more based on \n\nthe molecular profile of their cancers, and although in some cases this is already a current \n\npractise in others it would be very expensive and time consuming to be performed (Sim\u00f5es, \n\n2010). \n\nIt is also well recognized that our lifestyle and dietary habits can prevent several \n\ndiseases, including cancer. Among the several types of cancer, diet directly affects the \n\ngastrointestinal tract and thus can contribute to prevent or develop/accelerate tumors of \n\ngastrointestinal organs. It is known for decades that dietary fibers can contribute to health \n\npromoting, as they are indigestible in human tract and are fermented by colonic bacteria. The \n\nfiber types that are most amenable to fermentation are the soluble ones, found in foods such as \n\nberries, beans, flax seeds, plums, apples, and oats, and in some fiber supplements, such as \n\nthose using psyllium and guar gum (Dharmarajan, Ravunniarath, &amp; Pitchumoni, 2003a). \n\nInsoluble fibers (found in such foods as vegetables, the bran of grains e.g. wheat bran, nuts, and \n\nseeds) are not available for efficient fermentation, but it is still important in the colon. It provides \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Bibliographic review \n\n______________________________________________________________________ \n\n40 \n \n \n\nvolume to the feces and its tendency to \"speed things along\" means that the fermentation will \n\ntake place all along the length of the colon, including near the end, where the majority of colon \n\ncarcinoma occurs (Dharmarajan, Ravunniarath, &amp; Pitchumoni, 2003b).  \n\nWithout insoluble fibers, most of the fermentation would take place in the top part of the \n\ncolon and the top colon cells would get most of the benefit. As a result of this fermentation, SCFA \n\nare released and contribute to eliminate potential dangerous cells. It is difficult to get these in our \n\nfood, so the body relies on the process going on in the colon to make these essential \n\nbiomolecules. Among these SCFA, butyrate, propionate and acetate are gaining most attention in \n\nthe last decades. Several studies proved that these compounds can induce cell death of various \n\nmalignant cell types namely CRC cells through apoptosis, a mechanism used by organisms to \n\nmaintain homeostasis and protection. \n\nIn the gastrointestinal tract, apoptosis is an important protective process eliminating cells \n\nwith DNA damage that may otherwise progress to malignancy (Clarke et al., 2012) . Some study \n\nconfirms the pro-apoptotic actions of SCFA, further supporting their potential as important \n\nadjunctive therapies for the treatment of colonic neoplasms (Matthews et al., 2012). Among the \n\nSCFA, butyrate seems to have the major effects in preventing malignant cells proliferation \n\nthrough apoptosis. Although many advances that have been made on the mode of action of these \n\nbiomolecules, studies on these compounds are still needed, because despite of existing at high \n\nconcentrations in the human intestine, transformed cells continue to arise in the colon and lead \n\nto the development of colorectal carcinomas.  \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Design of protocols for undergraduated \n\nstudents to illustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid on \n\nyeast cell cycle and cell death \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Design of protocols for undergraduated students to illustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid in yeast \ncell cycle and cell death \n_____________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n42 \n \n \n\n1. Insights from Sacharomyces cerevisiae on the role of acetate in CRC cells - a \n\npractical application \n \n\nOne aim of this work was to develop a protocol for secondary school students, to \n\nillustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid on two key cellular biological processes, namely on, \n\ncell cycle and cell death. Most of the experimental protocols described in the literature to monitor \n\nthese cellular processes involve expensive reagents, complex protocols and sophisticated \n\nequipment. In Portuguese secondary schools it is very difficult to implement the experimental \n\nprotocols described in the literature. Indeed these protocols include the monitoring of different \n\nfunctional, structural and morphological alterations associated with quite intricate cellular events \n\nwhich required for its characterization, different fluorescent techniques and transmission electron \n\nmicroscopy. Since these experiments are not feasible in the labs of secondary schools, we aimed \n\nat exploiting very simple techniques and biological materials such as bright field microscopy \n\nassociated with differential coloration of yeast cells to demonstrate the effect of a short chain fatty \n\nacid, like acetic acid on cell cycle progression and cell death.  \n\nCulturing yeast is simple, economical, and fast. Indeed yeast cells are characterized by a \n\ndoubling time of approximately 90 min on a rich medium and are well adapted to both aerobic \n\nand anaerobic growth conditions. With few exceptions the yeast cell divides mitotically by forming \n\na bud, which pinches off to form a daughter cell. The progression through the cell cycle can be \n\nmonitored by the microscopic observation as described below. \n\nAnother advantage to work with yeast cells and in particular with the species \n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the common baker\u00b4s yeast, is that it is a genetically well-\n\ncharacterized organism which provides useful and numerous genetic and molecular biology tools \n\nfor researchers. S. cerevisiae has been therefore the most extensively studied one, and become \n\nprogressively a preferred research cellular model system in several areas of cell biology. Though \n\nthe easy handling and genetic tractability of S. cerevisiae resemble those of bacteria, yeast is \n\nadditionally coupled to the functional advantage of being an eukaryotic cell. Moreover, the \n\nrecognition that most basic cellular processes are conserved in S. cerevisiae led to its extensive \n\nuse a preferred cellular model system in several areas of cell biology. It has become apparent \n\nthat, among other cellular processes, the cell cycle and apoptotic core machinery are conserved \n\nin yeast to a degree that makes it a suitable model organism to approach pending questions on \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Design of protocols for undergraduated students to illustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid in yeast \ncell cycle and cell death \n_____________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n43 \n \n \n\ncell cycle and apoptosis in human cells, and on its deregulation in the context of cancer, \n\nneurodegenerative diseases and aging (Carmona-Gutierrez et al., 2010). \n\nHowever, an intriguing question came rapidly to our mind: why does a unicellular \n\norganism commits suicide? Apoptotic cell death seemed to be a process that was absent in \n\nyeast. Not only did a cellular suicide program make no sense for an organism consisting of just \n\none cell, plain homology searches indicated the absence of crucial regulators of apoptosis \n\n(Madeo et al., 2004). However, discovery of an apoptotic phenotype in a yeast strain carrying a \n\nCDC48 mutation this idea (Madeo, Frohlich, &amp; Frohlich, 1997). Yeast populations should not be \n\ninterpreted just as a group of partitioned unicellular organisms that do not communicate among \n\neach other, but rather as a multicellular community of interacting individuals. Under certain \n\ncircumstances, death of a single cell might be beneficial for the whole population, thus promoting \n\nthe survival of the clone. When dying, aged yeast cells actively stimulate the survival of the clone \n\nby releasing defined substances into their surroundings. The death of older cells is advantageous \n\nfor two reasons: first, because it spares nutrients for younger cells; and second, because the \n\nolder cells release nutrients that can be metabolized by active proliferative younger cells. Several \n\nyeast physiological scenarios, in which altruistic death of single cells promotes survival of the \n\npopulation, strongly support this idea (Buttner et al., 2006).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Design of protocols for undergraduated students to illustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid in yeast \ncell cycle and cell death \n_____________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n44 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - Physiological scenarios of yeast apoptosis (Adapted from Buttner et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nSince 1997 numerous studies have shown that different stimuli can trigger a death \n\nprocess in yeast, which share with mammalian cells common apoptotic features. These stimuli \n\ncan be provided externally in the form of chemical or physical stress, via heterologous expression \n\nof human proapoptotic proteins (exogenous triggers) or by the yeast cells themselves, as part of \n\nlethal signal transduction pathways (endogenous triggers) (Carmona-Gutierrez et al., 2010). \n\nAcetic acid acts as an exogenous trigger and has been extensively exploited by us and \n\nother groups as a compound commonly used to induce yeast apoptosis. Indeed we first showed \n\nin our laboratory that treatment with acetic acid at low concentrations could induce apoptotic cell \n\ndeath, while higher concentrations appeared to induce necrosis, a form of passive cell death \n\n(Ludovico et al., 2002); (Ludovico, Sousa, Silva, Leao, &amp; Corte-Real, 2001).

Treatment of yeast cells with acetic acid leads to mitochondrial \n\ncytochrome-c release (Ludovico et al., 2002) and depends on the presence of the yeast orthologs \n\nof adenine nucleotide translocator. (Pereira, Camougrand, Manon, Sousa, &amp; Corte-Real, 2007). \n\nDisruption of cytochrome-c partially prevents acetic acid-induced cell death, which is linked to \n\nenhanced mitochondrial membrane potential and loss of cytochrome-c oxidase activity. \n\nConsistently, ?o cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA, and hence respiration-deficient cells, display \n\nresistance against acetic acid-induced cell death (Ludovico et al., 2002). Valenti et al. (2008) \n\ndemonstrated that acetic acid-induced apoptosis requires temporary activation of the proteasome \n\n(Valenti et al., 2008), which suggests the existence of a cross-talk between the antioxidant \n\ndefense and the proteolytic systems. We also found that the vacuolar protease Pep4p is \n\ntranslocated from the vacuole into the cytosol and has a role in mitochondria degradation in cells \n\nundergoing acetic acid induced apoptosis (Pereira et al., 2010). Interestingly, as discussed above \n\n(see 6.3), our results on acetate induced apoptosis in CRC cells (see in 6.3) are in accordance \n\nwith the results obtained in yeast. This reinforces the yeast cell as a good model to study basic \n\nmechanisms involved in cancer cells.   \n\nTaking into account all the aforementioned advantages on the use of yeast as a cell \n\nmodel system and the need to addresses the topics on cell cycle and cell death in the scope of \n\nthe program of eleventh year, we considered interesting and adequate to develop a protocol \n\nbased on very simple experimental approaches to demonstrate the effect of acetic acid on yeast \n\ncell cycle progression and cell death induction. \n\n \n\n2.

Protocol for the analysis of cell cycle  \n \n\nCell proliferation is the process by which a cell of one type gives rise to two cells that are \n\nessentially identical. Given sufficient nutrients, yeasts cells double in number every 90 min \n\napproximately. The analysis of cell cycle in S. cerevisiae is a very simple experiment. Yeast grows \n\nby budding, which means that the original \"mother\" cell gives rise to an ellipsoidal daughter cell \n\nmade of entirely new cell surface material (Herskowitz, 1988). The identification of the cell cycle \n\nphase of a budding yeast cell can be recognized by the cell morphology (bud size) and nuclear \n\ndivision. The size of the bud indicates approximately the position of the yeast cell in the cell cycle. \n\nFor example, unbudded cells are in G1 (Herskowitz, 1988). To observe cell proliferation in the \n\nbudding yeast we suggest the following experimental procedure, the same that was used by us in \n\nthe laboratory. \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Experimental Procedure \n\n \n\nProcedure  \n\n \n\nStep 1: Distribute 5 ml of culture medium in each falcon tube and inoculate with a concentrated \n\ncell suspension to obtain an initial optical density at 640 nm (OD640) of about 0.1. \n\n \n\n Step 2: Add acetic acid from a stock solution (17.5 M) to obtain the following final \n\nconcentrations: \n\n \n\n?0 mM ? 5ml of the medium + yeast + 0 \u00b5l of acetic acid (negative control) \n\n?10 mM ? 5ml of the medium + yeast + 2.8 \u00b5l of acetic acid \n\n?20 mM ? 5ml of the medium + yeast + 5.6 \u00b5l of acetic acid \n\n?30 mM ? 5ml of the medium + yeast + 8.57 \u00b5l of acetic acid \n\n \n\nStep 3: Harvest a sample every 2 h to measure the OD640, and observe under the microscope to \n\ncount approximately 200 cells, and determine the % of cells in the different phase of the cell \n\ncycle. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Design of protocols for undergraduated students to illustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid in yeast \ncell cycle and cell death \n_____________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n48 \n \n \n\n2. 5. Protocol for the analysis of cell death \n \n\nThe observation of cell death in S. cerevisiae is also a very simple experiment. To \n\nobserve cell death cells were exposed to acetic acid at different concentrations (60, 80 and 120 \n\nmM), pH 3\u00b10, and methylene blue, a dye that stains blue metabolic inactive cells (\u201cdeath cells\u201d). \n\nCells metabolic active can also take the dye, but is processed by active enzymes and reduced. \n\nThe reduced form of the dye is colorless and hence metabolic active cells (\u201cviable cells\u201d) do not \n\nstain blue. \n\n \n\n2.5.1.

Results and discussion \n\n3.1. Effect of acetic acid on cell cycle progression  \n \n\nOur first attempt was to growth the yeast cells in an inexpensive culture medium and of \n\neasy preparation. Therefore, we first tested a medium containing white flour and sacarose as \n\ncarbon source. Though we observed cell growth and a negative effect of acetic acid in this \n\nmedium the cell density achieved was quite low (figure 7.1 a) which could limit the observations \n\nunder the microscope. Therefore in the following assays we used a rich medium with peptone, \n\nyeast extract and sacarose which allowed to achieve a higher cellular density figure 4.1 a) after \n\n24 h (OD640 of about 3.5 in comparison with 0.6). The increase in acetic acid concentration led to \n\nan increase of the inhibition of yeast growth (Fig. 7b). \n\nCell samples from cultures in this medium in the absence and presence of different \n\nconcentrations of acetic acid acetic were observed under the microscope to determine the % of \n\ncells in the different phases of the cell cycle (fig. 5c and 5d).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Design of protocols for undergraduated students to illustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid in yeast \ncell cycle and cell death \n_____________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n50 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\na \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nb \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n\n0,4\n\n0,5\n\n0,6\n\n0,7\n\n0 2 4 6 8 24\n\nD\nO\n\n6\n4\n0\nn\n\nM\n \n\nHours \n\n0mM\n\n10 mM\n\n20mM\n\n30mM\n\n0\n\n0,5\n\n1\n\n1,5\n\n2\n\n2,5\n\n3\n\n3,5\n\n4\n\n0 2 4 6 8\n\nD\nO\n\n6\n4\n0\nn\n\nM\n \n\nHours \n\n0 mM\n\n10mM\n\n20mM\n\n30mM\n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Design of protocols for undergraduated students to illustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid in yeast \ncell cycle and cell death \n_____________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n51 \n \n \n\n \n\nc \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nd \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nG1 phase \n\nS phase \n\nG2/M phase \n\n0,0\n\n20,0\n\n40,0\n\n60,0\n\n80,0\n\n100,0\n\n120,0\n\n0 2 4 6 8\n\n%\n c\n\nel\nls\n\n \n\nTime (h) \n\n0 mM  \n\nG2/M\n\nS\n\nG1\n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Design of protocols for undergraduated students to illustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid in yeast \ncell cycle and cell death \n_____________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n52 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0,0\n\n20,0\n\n40,0\n\n60,0\n\n80,0\n\n100,0\n\n120,0\n\n0 2 4 6 8\n\n%\n c\n\nel\nls\n\n \n\nTime (h) \n\n10 mM  \n\nG2/M\n\nS\n\nG1\n\n0,0\n\n20,0\n\n40,0\n\n60,0\n\n80,0\n\n100,0\n\n120,0\n\n0 2 4 6 8\n\n%\n c\n\nel\nls\n\n \n\nTime (h) \n\n20 mM  \n\nG2/M\n\nS\n\nG1\n\n\n\nChapter 2 \u2013 Design of protocols for undergraduated students to illustrate the effect of the SCFA acetic acid in yeast \ncell cycle and cell death \n_____________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n53 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - Effect of acetic acid on yeast growth and cell cycle progression.

Final conclusions \n\n \n\nIn the second part of this thesis we intended to develop protocols to illustrate key \n\nbiological processes that are discussed in biology classes for undergraduate students. The \n\ndifficulty to accomplish this objective was essentially due to the need to adapt the protocols and \n\ntechniques used in research laboratories, to the scarce facilities available in secondary school \n\nlabs. Laboratories in secondary schools are not equipped with the appropriate instrumentation \n\nthat allow the use of more advanced experimental approaches required to study complex cellular \n\nprocesses.  \n\nWe demonstrate that very simple protocols associated with the use of yeast cells and of a \n\nbasic optical microscope may be applied to illustrate two basic cellular processes, namely the \n\ncell cycle and cell death, in experimental biology at the secondary school level. \n\n0,0\n\n10,0\n\n20,0\n\n30,0\n\n40,0\n\n50,0\n\n60,0\n\n70,0\n\n80,0\n\n90,0\n\n100,0\n\n60 mM 80 mM 120 mM\n\n%\n u\n\n.f\n.c\n\n \n\n[Acetic Acid] \n\nCell Survival \n\nCell Survival\n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n \n \n\nReferences \n \n\nAbell, G.
