Internally, this subject has generated important debates among \n\n\u2013 but not exclusive to \u2013 political parties in the sense of greater regulation of the \n\nsector. This led to the formation of a coalition of key actors in Mozambican civil society (CS) \n\nleading to the advent of a CS platform for natural resources and extractive industries. However, in \n\n2012, the Mozambican government took an important step in preparing the sector for the upcoming \n\ntransformations. It is in this sequence of events that, in the same year, the revision of mining and \n\npetroleum laws appeared, which led CS to appeal for the need for transparency in the sector. This \n\nwas accompanied by advocacy campaigns by CS, particularly of the platform referred to above. \n\nThus, this study intends to answer the following question: what is the typology (or nature) of the \n\nexisting relationship between CS and the Government of Mozambique? The study favours a \n\nqualitative methodology based on a case study and self-completion interviews directed at actors in \n\nCS that were selected due to their relevant roles in the advocacy campaigns for the approval of the \n\nMining and Petroleum Laws in 2014. The results demonstrated that the relations established mainly \n\nhave components of complementarity, since this process was driven by different strategies of CS \n\nactors as well as the Government of Mozambique. This case study contributes to the literature on \n\nthe relations between the state and civil society in hybrid regimes. Future studies will be important \n\nto verify the extent to which those results are found in other areas of Mozambican politics and what \n\ndevelopments have occurred over time. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Civil Society, Platforms/Forums, Government, Complementarity, Mining Law, \n\nPetroleum Law \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nW \n\n\n\n iv \n\nSUMMARY \n\n \n\nom o boom dos recursos minerais a partir de meados do s\u00e9culo XXI Mo\u00e7ambique ficou \n\nna mira dos pa\u00edses que procuram investimentos no sector da Ind\u00fastria Extrativa. \n\nInternamente esta quest\u00e3o gerou importantes debates entre os partidos pol\u00edticos no \n\nsentido de uma maior regula\u00e7\u00e3o do setor mas n\u00e3o s\u00f3. Tal facto induziu a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\numa coliga\u00e7\u00e3o de atores-chave da Sociedade Civil (SC) mo\u00e7ambicana levando ao surgimento de \n\numa Plataforma da SC sobre Recursos Naturais e Ind\u00fastria Extrativa. Todavia, em 2012, o Governo \n\nMo\u00e7ambicano deu um passo importante ao preparar o setor para as transforma\u00e7\u00f5es que se \n\navizinhavam. \u00c9 nesta sequ\u00eancia que, no mesmo ano, surgiu a Revis\u00e3o das legisla\u00e7\u00f5es de Minas e \n\nPetr\u00f3leos, o que levou a SC a apelar para a necessidade de transpar\u00eancia do setor, que foram \n\nacompanhados por campanhas de advocacy por parte da SC, em especial, da Plataforma acima \n\nreferida. Assim, o presente estudo pretende responder \u00e0 seguinte quest\u00e3o: qual a tipologia (ou \n\nnatureza) das rela\u00e7\u00f5es existentes entre a SC e Governo de Mo\u00e7ambique? O estudo privilegia uma \n\nmetodologia qualitativa, baseada num estudo de caso e em entrevistas por autopreenchimento \n\ndirigidas aos atores da SC que foram selecionados em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do papel relevante nas campanhas de \n\nadvocacy para a aprova\u00e7\u00e3o da Lei de Minas e Lei dos Petr\u00f3leos em 2014. Os resultados alcan\u00e7ados \n\ndemonstram que as rela\u00e7\u00f5es estabelecidas t\u00eam sobretudo componentes de complementaridade, uma \n\nvez que este processo foi conduzido por estrat\u00e9gias diferentes por parte da SC bem como do \n\nGoverno de Mo\u00e7ambique. Este estudo de caso contribui para a literatura sobre as rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre \n\nestado e sociedade civil em regimes h\u00edbridos. Estudos futuros ser\u00e3o importantes para verificar em \n\nque medida estes resultados se verificam noutras \u00e1reas da pol\u00edtica mo\u00e7ambicana e que evolu\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nt\u00eam ocorrido ao longo do tempo.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Sociedade Civil, Plataformas/F\u00f3runs, Governo, complementaridade Lei das \n\nMinas, Lei dos Petr\u00f3leos   \n\n \n\n \n\nC \n\n\n\n v \n\nCONTENT \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ..........................................................................................................................................I \n\nABSTRACT ...............................................................................................................................................................

The objective of this research is to understand the relationship \n\nbetween CS and the government in Mozambique. This is a relevant research topic more than a \n\nquarter of century since the signing of the General Peace Agreement, which hallmarked the two-\n\nfold transition from war and one-partysm to peace and democracy. While recent events (namely \n\nthe resurgence of armed conflict in 2012) suggest that the path towards peace and democracy is far \n\nfrom linear, there have been landmark political changes followed by a considerable growth of the \n\nnumber of organisations in Mozambican CS. This introductory chapter seeks to provide a general \n\nframework for the topic, which includes the initial questions, the research objectives and the \n\nstructure outlined for the study.  \n\n \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nThe study of CS in Africa has acquired new emphasis on the processes of political liberation \n\ninitiated in the beginning of the 1990s, the last objective of which was the implementation of a \n\nformal democracy1. Among many others, the Ghanaian researcher Gyimah-Boadi (1996:118-119) \n\nwas one of the authors who emphasised the most central role of CS in this conjuncture, contributing \n\nto the successful preparation of elections and the installation of governments and opening space \n\nfor CS proliferation in this context. The studies by Bratton &amp; Van de Walle (1997) and Kraus \n\n(2007) also corroborate this view, since they point to the importance of trade unions, professional \n\nassociations, student groups, etc. in triggering the popular protests that led to political openness. \n\n                                                      \n1 Gyimah-Boadi (1996) highlights the 1990s as the beginning of \"formal democracy\" and the period in which CS \n\nemerges in Africa under external influences, such as the fall of communism and pressure from the international \n\ncommunity. Citizen\u2019s dedication supports a process of transition by opening up new political directions, such as the \n\npreparation of elections and the installation of new governments, opening the door to new contours of democracy.  \n\n \n\nC \n\n\n\n \n\n 2 \n\nA minimalist definition of CS \u2013 proposed by CIVICUS \u2013 suggests that it is an \"arena \n\nbeyond family, state and the market where people associate to advance common interests\" \n\n(Heinrich &amp; Fioramonti 2008). However, there are several authors who point out that it is difficult \n\nto apply this conceptualisation in Africa. According to Dias (2011: 136-139), the existing \n\nunderstanding of who represents CS in Africa departs from this paradigm. The CS concept is \n\nvariable according to specific contexts, and it may include unions, non-governmental organisations \n\n(NGOs), urban and modern associative movements, and civic organisations derived from religious \n\ninstitutions. In Chapter 2, we will return to this conceptual debate, as it is relevant to this study. \n\nIn Mozambique, CS \u2013 namely through the Christian Council of Mozambique (CCM) and \n\nthe Catholic Church (Van Den Bergh, 2009) \u2013 played a central role in the process of transition to \n\npeace and democracy. Furthermore, both the 1990 Constitutional Revision and the General Peace \n\nAgreement of 1992 contained provisions aimed at liberalising the performance of the parties and \n\norganisations of CS. \n\nAccording to article 78 of the CRM of 1990, \"the participation of social organisations is \n\nseen as a fundamental element for the promotion of democracy\", which is understood as a basis of \n\nguarantee for increasing the sense of collective ownership in government actions. Over the years, \n\nthe official discourse has been favourable to the performance of CS, seeing its participation in the \n\ngovernance process as positive. For example, the government's five-year plan (2010-2014) points \n\nout that, for the consolidation of democracy, \"the program governance should involve all interests \n\nand social forces, which guarantees them more opportunity to be accepted as legitimate, allowing \n\nthem to be heard\". \n\nDespite the transformations that have occurred since 1990 aiming at political liberalisation \n\nin Mozambique, the country is still considered a hybrid democracy where democratic institutions \n\nand authoritarian practices prevail (Morlino 2008, Sanches 2014, Sanches 2018). Although regular \n\nelections have existed since 1994, the results have translated into the systematic domination of \n\nFRELIMO, leading the opposition parties, notably RENAMO, to question the quality and integrity \n\nof the elections. Over time, no significant advances in the process of democratic consolidation have \n\nbeen made (Forquilha 2007: 76), and the resurgence of armed conflict in 2012 is also an expression \n\nof the fragility of democratisation processes in post-conflict contexts. \n\n\n\n \n\n 3 \n\nIt is within this setting of political hybridity that we try to understand the ways in which CS \n\nacts in the Mozambican context and, more specifically, what the nature of the relations between \n\nCS and government is. \n\nIn the case of Mozambique, the notion of who represents CS is comprehensive and may \n\ninclude formal and informal urban, rural, academic, professional, and voluntary organisations. \n\nOrganisations from different areas collaborate with each other by performing functions based on \n\nbelief, investigation, knowledge, provision of services to community-based organisations, \n\nplatforms, thematic networks, and movements and forums (Tops\u00f8e-Jensen et al., 2015). \n\nNevertheless, recent studies have enriched the debate surrounding the performance of CS in \n\nMozambique. Authors such as Homerin (2005), Francisco (2010), Brito (2012), Adalima &amp; \n\nNuvunga (2014), and Nipassa (2017) focused on the participation of CS and the new challenges of \n\nthe Government of Mozambique in discussing issues related to the legitimacy, autonomy, and \n\ndependence of CS on governance. In his study, Nipassa (2017) somewhat raised the issues of \n\npressure, lobbying, and advocacy on the part of different CS organisations, organisational \n\nplatforms, and/or forums such as advocacy campaigns for government publication of policies on \n\nextractive industries. \n\nIn 2007, networks of CS organisations focused on extractive industries emerged and started \n\na campaign of lobbying in which they appealed for clarity in the approval of contracts for the \n\nexploitation of natural resources, leading the government to publish such mining exploration \n\ncontracts in 2013. Consequently, the lobbying campaign contributed to the approval of the Mining \n\nLaw of 2014 (Nipassa, 2017:7), revoking the Mining Law of 2002. \n\nBoth the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law were approved as the last acts of the \n\nMozambican President Armando Em\u00edlio Guebuza in an economic context in which, according to \n\nTops\u00f8e-Jensen et al. (2015), Mozambique was opening up to foreign capital after discoveries of \n\ncoal reserves in Tete in 2009 and natural gas in the Rovuma Basin (Cabo Delgado) in 2012, as well \n\nas the discovery of natural gas in the Basin of Rovuma (Cabo Delgado) in 2012 that attracted \n\ninternational investors. \n\nOn one hand, there were persistent hotspots of instability in the country resulting from \n\npolitical tensions among the belligerent parties, so the laws were passed without consensus. The \n\nvotes were counted with a total absence of RENAMO on the parliamentary bench (Not\u00edcias \n\nnewspaper, 08/08/2014). On the other hand, according to Macuane, Buur &amp; Monjane (2017), citing \n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\nMabanza (2013), the discovery of mineral resources may have intensified political instability in \n\nthe country resulting from autocratic tendencies and state bureaucracy. \n\nIn an article published in Export.gov on 17 June, 2017, the International Trade \n\nAdministration (ITA) emphasised that extractive industries would be the sector that would \n\ncontribute better to the prospects for Mozambique. \n\nThese laws were intended to adjust the legal framework of the sector once the country \n\nopened to foreign capital after the discovery of one of the largest unexplored coal deposits in the \n\nworld, Tete thermal coal in 2009, as well as discoveries of minerals such as gold and graphite, \n\nwhich would put the country at a great competitive advantage over mining prices in the regional \n\ncontext when compared to its neighbour, South Africa. \n\nIn this context, the problem or the starting point that led to this decision making process \n\nand the definition of the proposed theme has to do with the lack of knowledge, or at least \n\ninsufficient knowledge, of the implications of CS participation in governance in Mozambique in \n\nthe recent past, as well as the impact of the various political decisions presented in the period \n\nbetween 2010 and 2014 on the Mining Law of 20/2014 and the Petroleum Law of 21/2014. \n\nTherefore, before the complexity of interpreting CS fields of action on the political \n\ndecisions of the Government of Mozambique, it is relevant to develop an analysis of the influence \n\nof CS, trying to identify the political agenda of the government and to what extent it was or was \n\nnot influenced, conditioned, diminished, or manipulated by CS. In this period of time, we will look \n\nparticularly at the emergence and role of civic associations in Mozambique in the period between \n\n1975 and 2016, when the number of organisations evolved from 709 to 4079 (see Appendix A). \n\nWe will also discuss the role played by the so-called (and new-born) CS from the analysis of the \n\nset of political decisions translated into legislation and which, framed in another production of a \n\ncomplementary nature, will constitute the corpus to be investigated. \n\nIn short, we want to answer the question: what is the typology (or nature) of the relationship \n\nbetween CS and the Government of Mozambique? This general issue is examined in the context \n\nof two laws: the Mining Act and the Petroleum Law approved in 2014. In observing those laws, \n\nwe were interested in understanding which mechanisms of action were/are used and if there is room \n\nfor manoeuvre for key actors in CS to influence political decisions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\n1.2 Objectives of the Study  \n\nGeneral: \n\n(I) To characterise the relationship between CS and the government in political decisions \n\nin Mozambique. \n\n(II) To understand the level of involvement of CS in political decisions in Mozambique. \n\nSpecific: \n\n(I) To contextualise and to describe the birth of CS in Mozambique. \n\n(II) To identify and map the main actors of CS (referring to the case study). \n\n(III) To relate CS's actions regarding the political decisions implemented in Mozambique in \n\nthe approval of the Mining and Petroleum Laws of 2014. \n\n \n\n1.3 Structure \n\nThe dissertation is divided into five chapters: general introduction, theoretical framework, work \n\nmethodology, contextualisation, and analysis and interpretation of the results. \n\n? Chapter 1 \u2013 Introduces the content of this research and enunciates the concept of CS adopted \n\nfrom the definition of CIVICUS. Here, the questions of research, objectives, and the structure \n\nof the research are presented.  \n\n? Chapter 2 \u2013 Within the theoretical framework, we frame CS in four theoretical dimensions: in \n\npolitical theory, in the context of international relations, in social movements as a form of \n\nparticipation, and in governance, which is the theoretical area that has shown to be the most \n\nrelevant for the research. \n\n? Chapter 3 \u2013 After selecting the field of analysis for the research, the methodology is then \n\nselected based on a case study using a qualitative method that involved documentary analysis \n\nand paper interviews in order to conduct the research. \n\n? Chapter 4 \u2013 We contextualise the research based on the literature review about the participation \n\nof CS in Mozambique in (4.1), participation of NGOs in Mozambique (4.2), involvement of \n\nMozambican CS in the 2010\u20132014 mandate (4.3), extractive industries in Mozambique versus \n\nplatforms and forums from 2010 to 2014 (4.4), and platforms of CS on natural resources and \n\nextractive industries versus the proposed Mining Law and Petroleum Law approved in 2014 \n\n(4.5). \n\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\n? Chapter 5 \u2013 The analysis follows and the results are presented in two sub-chapters: the \n\ncharacterisation of CSOs and CS involvement in governance. \n\n?

In \n\nthis sense, in order to construct a conceptual framework that supports the model of the \n\nstudy, we start from the framework of CS in political theory, its approach in international \n\nrelations theory, its approach to social movements as a form of participation, and finally, \n\nthe concept of CS in governance. We will place more emphasis on this last approach, as it contains \n\nthe main contributions that help us frame the CS role in governance processes in Mozambique. \n\n \n\n2.1 Civil Society in the Political Arena \n\n \n\nIn the theories of Gramsci (1974) and Hirschman (1984), CS involves a set of individual or \n\ncollective initiatives for the public good and is formed by a group of freely associated people, who \n\ncan fit into the fabric of society, performing diverse actions in a participatory manner. It is from \n\nthis notion that Bratton (1994) distinguishes that for the associated life to become institutionalised, \n\nit must be expressed in the form of an organisation where the organisational structure constitutes a \n\ngathering of citizens who come together because of identity or interest to pursue a common goal. \n\nFor the author, this concept is to be considered when those people construct a different sphere of \n\ninfluence and even work \"against the State\". \n\nIn the same vein, authors such as Azarya (1994) and Harbeson, Rothchild, &amp; Chazan (1994) \n\nseek attention for a model of organisation in association form that can be connoted with an active \n\nCS, where the benefits of \"public participation\" help balance the power of the state over citizens. \n\nHowever, the authors acknowledge that not all associations can be considered to be part of CS, \n\nbecause of the precondition that these should not be formed or controlled by the state; otherwise, \n\nthey would simply be agents of state hegemony and would weaken CS. \n\nIn this context, Cohen &amp; Arato (1994) associate \"participation\" with the model of \n\ndemocracy where, in order to classify or define a particular political class as democratic, the \n\n\"periodicity of conduct of elections and respect for civil rights, regardless of type of public or \n\nprivate institutions existing in the State\" should occur. Although the models of democracy are very \n\nvariable, this model should be evaluated. \n\nI \n\n\n\n \n\n 8 \n\nIn a different way, the CS concept was shaped to serve the purpose of \"Good Governance\"2 \n\nrather than a deeper understanding of social formations and the associations that represent both \n\nthem and the state (Kasfir, 1998). In the same vein, many academics reflect on a \"participatory \n\ndemocracy\"3, which proposes ways for the government to be more dependent on the people, \n\ninterconnecting the relationship between civil society vis-\u00e0-vis democracy. \n\nThis thought was progressively refined by theoreticians like Tocqueville (2008), who \n\nconsidered the art of association as a fundamental principle of democracy. In the author\u2019s view, the \n\nscience of \"associativism\"4 is regarded as the mother of progress; in order for people to remain or \n\nto become civilised, they must develop or perfect the art of association in the same proportion as \n\nthe equality of conditions. \n\nTherefore, looking at the nature of the debate and contemporary theories, democracy is seen \n\nas the only way for the government to respond to the needs of the majority by accepting the freedom \n\nof \"public opinion\", thwarting vicious cycles, promoting peace, and warranting citizens' rights, \n\nfreedoms, and aspirations, thus contributing to the efficiency of governments (Ibrahim, 2015 apud \n\nRubin, 2001). In this context, it is particularly relevant to discuss the perspective that embraces the \n\nnotion of public opinion in the concept of democracy. According to Habermas (1996), \"public \n\nopinion is converted into communicative strength and power within society\". In the view of the \n\nauthor, the rise of CS translates opinions that reflect a modern logic and propels a levelling of \n\nformal public rights within a society. \n\nTherefore, we can verify a diversity of approaches described in political thought by \n\nGramsci, Hirschman, Habermas, Bratton, Cohen &amp; Arato, Kasfir, and Tocqueville. This is contrary \n\nto the various debates related to globalisation, where CS is thought to integrate the transnational \n\nperspective of relationships that are established between non-state actors in the field of \n\n                                                      \n2 (Bovaird &amp; Loffler, 2003) consider that \"Good Governance\" derives from the concept of public governance, which \n\ninvolves several ways in which stakeholders interact with one another when it comes to public policy. Thus, good \n\ngovernance would be the negotiation of all of the parties involved in a single problem, with the objective of improving \n\nthe results of public policies. \n\n3 The participatory democracy is addressed in the sense of the possibility of including citizens in order to contribute to \n\nthe various decision-making processes in a state. \n\n4 For theoreticians like Tocqueville (2008), the theory of \"associativism\" is a fundamental characteristic of democracy, \n\nsince it includes the participation of people in a group that aims to achieve several common objectives, and associations \n\nare regarded as the cause of union and progress.   \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 9 \n\ninternational relations (2.2), include new tendencies of social demands that are defended by lobby \n\ngroups in order to promote social movements (2.3), and, finally, play a role in governance (2.4). \n\n \n\n2.2 Civil Society in the Area of International Relations \n\n \n\nAs actors of international relations, Santos &amp; Ferreira (2012) identify civil societies as \"pressure \n\nforces\"5 that make their effects felt by reinforcing the multilateral tendency derived from the \n\narticulation established between state and non-state actors. The authors identify a tendentially \n\nglobalised CS, which is evidenced by the capacity of active participation of actors and transnational \n\nlobby forces from the individual to the most altered forms of collective organisation. \n\nThe existence of a \"global or transnational\" CS6 addressed by Herz &amp; Hoffman (2004) \n\nbecame the main contribution of the 21st century, contrary to the usual discourse that CS was an \n\nessential element of the process of democratisation or even the main source of solidarity and social \n\nintegration (Cohen &amp; Arato, 1994). Truyol &amp; Serra (1993) characterised forces and lobby groups \n\nof \"social, cultural, intellectual, economic, political, religious and ideological union\", which \n\nidentify CS as a set of spontaneous exchanges, personal contacts, and generators of phenomena \n\nbetween co-ordinated transnational relations. \n\nRosenau (1997), Boulding (1991), Truyol &amp; Serra (1993) also analyse transnational \n\nrelations and CS. The authors argue that there is influence exercised by the \"transnational \n\ninteractions\" that produce effects of alteration in the international behaviours of states. They admit \n\nthat there is a phenomenon of progressive awareness of individuals and societies about certain \n\nsubjects that transcend the geocultural context of their territorial expression and that affect \n\neveryday life. \n\nIt is in this context that Santos &amp; Ferreira (2012) point to the \"State, sovereignty, \n\nterritoriality and borders\" as factors that must be put into question in the elaboration of consequent \n\nsolutions to global problems. According to the authors, demographic issues such as migration, \n\n                                                      \n5 Pressure forces were identified by Habermas (2006) in his studies as voluntary groupings that operated outside the \n\nsphere of the state that exerted a force capable of influencing the decisions of state power. \n\n6 Global or transnational civil society in the view of Herz &amp; Hoffman (2004) constitutes the existence of groups, \n\nindividuals, or even social classes whose characteristics and actions are supra-territorial and at a global level that \n\ninteract and develop beyond the state. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 10 \n\nrefugees, hunger, education, basic sanitation, climate change, unequal distribution of wealth, \n\nenvironmental degradation, and transnational organised crime can deepen interdependencies. The \n\nauthors look at the participation of CS in the governance process and affirm that the fundamental \n\nquestion is due to representativeness and legitimacy. Having a look at non-governmental \n\norganisations (NGOs) as CS actors, it is clear that they gain more power and goodwill to work \n\ntogether and influence government decisions  \n\nIt is in this way that it becomes relevant to address the actions of non-state actors such as \n\nCSOs and NGOs, which not only channel significant contributions in terms of the direct effects \n\ninherent to the functions performed, but also integrate themselves into decision-making areas such \n\nas governance. \n\n \n\n2.3 Social Movements (as a Form of Participation of CS) \n\n \n\nThe theories of the classical model often consider groups that provoke political tensions and the \n\ndiscourses of leaders and followers who are positioned to change institutions in a radical way. \n\nThese social movements were identified and modelled after the revolutionary movements that were \n\nonce conceived as mass mobilisation disputes from an antagonistic state, where the aim of the \n\n\"revolutionaries\" was to replace an oppressive form of state power with one that was oriented to \n\ndifferent goals (Alexander, 2006). These movements were associated with an idea of revolution \n\nthat produced a distinct tactical orientation to the violence of power and, in turn, this collective \n\naction can be understood as a struggle for position. Della Porta (2005) considers social movements \n\nas organising networks and individuals with common values who mainly use unconventional forms \n\nof political \"participation\" to achieve their political goals. However, the author points to a current \n\ncontradiction of these movements in relation to the balance of participation and representation, \n\nhighlighting the \"traditional social movement\" as an example. Without resources, it places \n\nconfidence in the voluntary work of its members, where participatory models of democracy play \n\nan important role in market governance and liberalisation, and thus taking social justice and \n\nparticipatory democracy into consideration. \n\nDella Porta (2005), citing Bohman (1997), further points out that deliberative democracy, \n\nin theory, is a purpose that occurs among individuals able to develop capacities that give them \n\n\n\n \n\n 11 \n\naccess to the \"public sphere\"7. Once in public, they should be given enough respect and knowledge \n\nin order to be able to influence decisions. Here, the participation of individuals is also considered \n\npositive in terms of specific contribution to knowledge construction. The public sphere embraces \n\nseveral diversities. For Castells (2008), it constitutes an inseparable field of two fundamental \n\ndimensions in modern societies, among which is \"Civil Society and State\". It not only includes \n\n\"media\" and spaces of public interaction, but also can be seen as a cultural repository of ideas and \n\nprojects that fuel public debate. It is through the public sphere that CS conflicts with this public \n\ndebate and, ultimately, influences the decisions of the state, thus establishing an interaction \n\nbetween the CS and the state. \n\n \n\n2.4 Civil Society and Governance \n\n \n\nThe increase of non-state actors in the provision of public services leads us to think about the \n\ndichotomy of governance and civil society or even about the relationship between the \n\npredominance of one and concept of the other. It is for this reason that we find it pertinent within \n\nthe theoretical framework, which fits within the field of analysis of the present study, to finally \n\nbring the role of CS in governance into the discussion, which may help lead to a better conceptual \n\nperception and better choice of the ideal model for the present case study. \n\nRegarding the CS and governance subject, authors such as Tandon &amp; Mohanty (2000) point \n\nto factors that led to greater disenchantment of people vis-\u00e0-vis government institutions, such as \n\nthe rapid decrease in the capacity of certain institutions to respond to diverse interests and \n\nexpectations of the population, the growing gap in government policies and their practical \n\nelaboration, the growing distance and alienation of the poor and marginalised from elite-dominated \n\ngovernment institutions, and the persistence of problems of poverty, exclusion, and marginalisation \n\nin many countries of the world. \n\nIt is in this context that Bevir (2010) maintains that the notion of governance is considered \n\nas government process being carried out as an organisation in formal or informal territory through \n\n                                                      \n7 For Kaene (1998), public sphere is a concept that is intended as a spatial relationship between two or more people \n\nconnected by a communication link. The author mentions the relationship between power, which operates with a \n\nparticular kind of interaction, and debates in public circles. The author identifies societies as being composed of public \n\nspheres of different levels according to the problems and circumstances of the moment. \n\n\n\n \n\n 12 \n\nlaws, norms, power, or language. In this author\u2019s view, this notion differs from the government \n\nitself, which focuses on actions and not on the state and its institutions. Thus, social organisations \n\nbecome much more involved in the practice of social activities and state supervision. \n\nThe World Bank was the institution that most popularised the notion of governance \n\n(Tandon &amp; Mohanty, 2000). Authors such as Williams &amp; Young (1994) point to the involvement \n\nof CS as voluntary organisations and NGOs as institutions that participate as intermediaries \n\nbetween the government and the people in the governance processes in order to build a pluralistic \n\nstructure. In the authors\u2019 view, CS's role in governance is linked to the promotion of responsibility, \n\nlegitimacy, transparency, and participation. \n\nFor Bevir (2010), responsibility is addressed in a context of hierarchical relations, service \n\ndelivery based on transparency, facilities, and incentive structures for \"Good Governance\", which \n\nis incorporated into the discourse on development, according to Ghaus-Pasha (2004). The author \n\nargues that without an appropriate governance structure, developing countries will not be able to \n\nsustain economic growth. In other words, they will not be able to have a rapid reduction of poverty. \n\nThe existence of a responsible CS could contribute to promoting democracy and \n\nencouraging good governance. Thus, not only governments but also civil societies are required to \n\npractice transparency through the publication of reports, comments, clear procedures, and conduct \n\nof actions by decision-makers, because it will only be accessible to citizens in this way (Rondinelli \n\n&amp; Cheema, 2003). According to Weiss (2000), in governance processes, governments continue to \n\nbe the main agents in the provision of public goods, despite the growing involvement of non-state \n\nactors such as CS, voluntary agencies, NGOs, and corporate agencies in solving social problems. \n\nThis growing involvement of non-state actors leads us to question the approach of authors \n\nsuch as Coston (1998), who classified the relationship between CS, in this case \"NGOs\", and \n\ngovernment based on different dimensions such as resistance to the government or the acceptance \n\nof institutional pluralism, the relative balance of power in the relationship, and the degree of \n\nformality and, by extension, the level of nongovernmental linkage. According to Coston (1998), in \n\nthe governance process, the relationship between CS and government depends on the \n\ncircumstances, although, for the author, it seems inevitable that governments will increasingly \n\naccept institutional pluralism. Thus, the type of relationship will depend on the government and \n\nthe willingness of NGOs to engage in formal relations. \n\n\n\n \n\n 13 \n\nIn his study, Najam (2000) also adopted the definition of NGOs as being a vast network of \n\n\"non-profit, voluntary, charitable organizations, associates who are wholly or largely independent \n\nof the Government\". According to the author, it is on the basis of this concept that NGOs are \n\nconsidered to have an \"interest in public policies\". Najam (2000) proposes a 4Cs analysis of the \n\nrelationship between the government and the tertiary sector8 (in this case, NGOs) based on the \n\nobjectives (or purposes) of \"NGO-Government\" institutions and their strategies for (or means of) \n\nachieving a particular goal. It is this model of analysis that we will use to frame our research, given \n\nits similarity in the selection of the chosen institutions (NGOs and government). \n\nAccording to Najam (2000), the 4Cs model presupposes that in the governance process, as \n\nCS organisations participate in the elaboration of certain government policies, there may be \n\n\"Cooperation, Confrontation, Complementarity or Co-optation\". These occur in certain \n\ncombinations, such as: (i) co-operation \u2013 when the government and the organisation seek objectives \n\nand use similar strategies, (ii) confrontation \u2013 when they seek different goals and use different \n\nstrategies, (iii) complementarity \u2013 when they pursue similar goals, but the strategies are different, \n\nand (iv) co-optation \u2013 when they opt for similar strategies but for different purposes. Thus, the 4Cs \n\nmodel proposed by the author is summarised in Fig 2.4.1 below. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4.1: The 4Cs of NGO-Government Relations (Najam, 2000: 384) \n\n \n\nUsing this perspective, we will consider fundamental elements of the relationship between CS and \n\nthe government in terms of regimes of hybrid character for the case study. In regimes where \n\n                                                      \n8 The tertiary sector incorporates civil society as an integral part of the system, which operates for the good of the \n\npublic and the provision of social services at local and international level (Evers &amp; Laville, 2004). \n\n \n\n          Goals (Ends)  \n\n \n\n \n\n  Similar Dissimilar \n\nPreferred  \n\nStrategies \n\n(Means) \n\nSimilar Co-operation  \n\n \n\nCo-optation  \n\n \n\n Dissimilar Complementarity  \n\n \n\nConfrontation  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 14 \n\nauthoritarian practices prevail, there are greater obstacles for CS's performance, since governments \n\ncan block CS's participation, weaken its autonomy with highly restrictive legislation, and even co-\n\nopt organisations through vertical relationships and patronage (Kew &amp; Oshikoya, 2014). As \n\nMazepus (2012: 8) emphasises, CS can play a fundamental role in regime change or in the \n\nsupport/maintenance of it. Citing Migdal (2001), Mazepus (2012: 8) also considers that relations \n\nbetween CS and the state are \"dynamic\" and can often vary through new alliances and new laws. \n\nThus, these relationships are always shaped by changes in the social, political, and economic needs \n\nof citizens. \n\nIf we focus on the 4Cs model applied by Najam (2000) and look at the nature of the regime \n\nin Mozambique, we find fewer elements of a co-operation relationship between CS and \n\ngovernment. In this sense, we consider that the relationship between CS and government is \n\nmediated by the characteristics of the regime. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 15 \n\nCHAPTER 3  \n\n RESEARCH METHODOLOGY \n\n \n\nased on the theoretical model that analyses the role of CS in governance, we present \n\nthe methodology of the study in this chapter. As a starting point, it uses the \n\nunderstanding of the various forms of participation of CS within a collective that were \n\nenunciated in the previous chapter and that are summarised in the figure below. The \n\nfield of analysis that is observed in figure 3.1 represents the fundamental object of the research. To \n\nanalyse the existent or non-existent influence of CS in governance, we have selected CS actors \u2013 \n\nin this case NGOs, CSOs and social movements \u2013 that acted individually in the campaigns for the \n\nMining and Petroleum Laws that were approved in 2014 and that have joined the Platform on \n\nMineral Resources and Extractive Industries. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.1: Civil society organisations (CSOs), social movements (MS), non-governmental \n\norganisations (NGOs), and government Source: Author\u2019s own elaboration.  \n\n \n\n3.1 Methods and data  \n\n \n\nThis research is based on a case study. According to Thomas (2011: 513-514), a case study \n\nconcerns the analysis of people, decisions, political projects, institutions, or other systemic forms \n\nthat are holistically studied through one or more methods. In a more precise definition, case studies \n\nconcern \"intensive research using the qualitative or quantitative method in one or multiple cases, \n\nwhere the researcher's goal is to understand a larger dimension of similar cases\" (Seawright and \n\nGerring, 2008: 296). When selecting the case, the objective is to explore a phenomenon intensively, \n\ntrying to verify to what extent certain theoretical and empirical postulates are fulfilled or not \n\nfulfilled. Hence, many case studies allow us to generate interesting hypotheses for future research. \n\nB \n\n\n\n \n\n 16 \n\nIn the course of this investigation, we try to cross-reference various types of data, including \n\ncollecting concrete experiences through testimonies given by CS organisations. The \n\nbibliographical research sought to contextualise the areas of discussion of the CS concept and its \n\napplication to the African and Mozambican context, particularly highlighting its involvement in \n\nthe third wave of democratisation9. In addition to being a qualitative work, we used other strategies \n\nto collect and analyse data, namely document analysis and self-completion interviews. \n\n \n\n3.2 Documentary Analysis \n\n \n\nThis process consisted of the perusal of various documents, namely newspapers, decrees, laws, and \n\npapers produced by governmental and non-governmental institutions inside and outside of \n\nMozambique. This phase of the research involved the queries of some web pages as sources : \n\nhttp://www.dw.com/pt-002/ongs-querem-participar-da-gest\u00e3o-de-recursos-naturais-em-\n\nmo\u00e7ambique/a-6556470, accessed on 18 November 2017. \n\nSince we intended to study CS's scope in Mozambique, this site made it possible to access \n\nnews stories that explained of the creation of a platform of CS that emerged with the objective of \n\npromoting transparency and improvement in the government management of the natural resources \n\nand extractive industries. In the next phase, we accessed the papers published by the Public \n\nIntegrity Centre (CIP) through the site: https://cipmoz.org/index.php/pt/industria-extractiva/507-\n\nrevisao-da-lei-do-petroleo-nao-ha-consulta-publica-nao-ha-transparencia.  \n\nIn this study, the emphasis was on documentary analysis. The published information \n\nrevealed the lack of public consultation and transparency on the part of the Mozambican authorities \n\nafter the publication of the revision of the Petroleum Law in the government portal in 2013. In the \n\nnext phase, we accessed the consultation of the legislation published in the government portal: \n\nhttp://www.mireme.gov.mz/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;view=category&amp;id=5:lei&amp;\n\nItemid=150. On this website, it was possible to access the legislation on the Mining Law and the \n\nPetroleum Law, which were approved by the Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique in 2014 \n\nand which will be duly dealt with in the chapter on analysis and interpretation of the results of this \n\nresearch.  \n\n                                                      \n9 In addressing the party systems in the African context, Sanches (2010), citing Bogaards (2004), states that the third \nwave of democratisation is characterised by the introduction of competitive multiparty elections that result from the \n\npredominance of historical parties. \n\nhttp://www.dw.com/pt-002/ongs-querem-participar-da-gest\u00e3o-de-recursos-naturais-em-mo\u00e7ambique/a-6556470\nhttp://www.dw.com/pt-002/ongs-querem-participar-da-gest\u00e3o-de-recursos-naturais-em-mo\u00e7ambique/a-6556470\nhttps://cipmoz.org/index.php/pt/industria-extractiva/507-revisao-da-lei-do-petroleo-nao-ha-consulta-publica-nao-ha-transparencia\nhttps://cipmoz.org/index.php/pt/industria-extractiva/507-revisao-da-lei-do-petroleo-nao-ha-consulta-publica-nao-ha-transparencia\nhttp://www.mireme.gov.mz/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;view=category&amp;id=5:lei&amp;Itemid=150\nhttp://www.mireme.gov.mz/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&amp;view=category&amp;id=5:lei&amp;Itemid=150\n\n\n \n\n 17 \n\nThe procedure for this method of gathering information seemed to be the most appropriate, \n\nsince it allowed the selection of contents about extractive industries in Mozambique, the Mining \n\nLaw and Petroleum Law, and CS organisations that participated in advocacy campaigns and lobby \n\ncampaigns directed at the legislation under a study approved in 2014. The use of this technique \n\nproved to be relevant, since it allowed the selection of the case study. \n\n \n\n3.3 (Self-completion) Interviews \n\n \n\nIn order to respond to the proposed research objectives, it was essential to gather the views and \n\nperceptions of CS's key actors. These were selected based on the relevant roles they played in the \n\nadvocacy campaigns of the Mining and Petroleum Laws approved in 2014. \n\nThese actors participated in civic actions as organised groups of CS in a platform network \n\non mineral resources and extractive industries. The following organisations are included in the list \n\nof actors: Public Integrity Center (CIP), Terra Viva Center (CTV), World Wildlife Fund for Nature \n\n(WWF), National Association of Rural Extension (AENA), Cabo Delgado Environmental \n\nAssociation (AMA), and Association for Legal Assistance and Assistance to Communities \n\n(AAAJC). The Action Program for Inclusive and Responsible Governance (AGIR) and the Women \n\nand Law Organization in Southern Africa-Mozambique (WLSA) are not part of the Platform on \n\nMineral Resources and Extractive Industries but participated as independent organisations in the \n\napproval of the Mining Law and Petroleum Law in 2014. \n\nInitially, the request for interviews was made to all organisations, and the goal was to \n\nconduct interviews via Skype. However, because of technical difficulties, none of the organisations \n\nwere willing to respond and instead chose to fill out a questionnaire. The interview script (see \n\nAppendix C) in Table I and Table II contained questions regarding the analytical dimensions to be \n\nexplored and analysed, namely the characterisation of selected CSOs for the case study, main areas \n\nof intervention of the same organisations, participation in governance processes (in the case of the \n\nMining and Petroleum Laws), the mechanisms used by these CSOs in governance processes in \n\nMozambique, and the level of government receptivity in CS interventions in governance processes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 18 \n\n3.4 Research Limitations \n\n \n\nThe first obvious limitation was the difficulty of accessing information published by the Assembly \n\nof the Republic of Mozambique, the legislative body that approved these Laws in 2014. In this \n\nlegislative body, it was only possible to access the reports on the Parliamentary Committee on \n\nConstitutional Affairs, Human Rights and Legality from 2014, as well as the report on the \n\nParliamentary Committee on Agriculture, Economy and Environment from the year that the laws \n\nwere approved. Hence, there was a need to analyse the relationship between CS and government. \n\nTherefore, we turned to the platforms and forums of CS on natural resources and extractive \n\nindustries involved in the advocacy campaign in the draft of the Mining and Petroleum Laws in \n\norder to be able to hear their views on the subject. \n\nAnother limitation on the evident information collection was the shortage of primary \n\nsources, namely documents that portrayed the involvement and participation of CS in the design \n\nof the Mining and Petroleum Laws. \n\nThe third limitation was a lack of direct contact with former or current cabinet members, in \n\norder to provide statements about the approval process of the laws approved in 2014. Having \n\ncabinet members\u2019 perspective would have been ideal to level the analysis, but unfortunately our \n\ncontacts did not produce a successful outcome. In an effort to bridge this gap we consulted several \n\nonline newspapers to try and find statements regarding the aforementioned laws10.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                      \n10 Mozambican news sites: http://www.verdade.co.mz/; http://www.jornalnoticias.co.mz/index ; \nhttp://opais.sapo.mz/; but also Portuguese ones: https://www.publico.pt/.   \n\nhttp://www.verdade.co.mz/\nhttp://opais.sapo.mz/\nhttps://www.publico.pt/\n\n\n \n\n 19 \n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n CIVIL SOCIETY IN MOZAMBIQUE: A CONTEXTUALISATION \n\n \n\nhis chapter, provides a general overview of the Mozambican civil society. It focuses \n\non the evolution of CS looking at NGOs participation, social movements and at the \n\nnetworks of platforms and forums of CS involved in proposing the Mining and \n\nPetroleum Laws approved in 2014. \n\n \n\n4.1 CS in the Mozambican Context \n\nThe chains of thought of Bayart (1986) and Chabal (1986) amplify the need to understand CS in \n\nAfrica. \n\n\u201c\u2026 Although we may discuss that the concept of CS does not apply outside of European history, I \n\nwill provisionally define it as the society in relation with the State, to the degree in which it is \n\nconfronting the state or, more accurately, as the process through which society attempts to \u2018violate\u2019 \n\nor neutralize the simultaneous \u2018totalisation\u2019 unleased by the State. The notion of CS is, therefore, an \n\nambivalent (and not only conflicting) concept\u2026\u201d (Bayart, 1986:111). \n\n \n\n \u201c\u2026 Without doubt, the ideal liberal democracy, if it were possible, would be a great improvement \n\nover that which exists in the majority of African countries in their governments. But it is not exactly \n\npossible, because liberal democracy was the historic result of particular circumstances in which \n\ncapitalism moulded the relation between State and Civil Society in Western Europe. The ideal \n\nGovernment in Africa today would be something different and whatever that would be, could only \n\nbe conceived in terms of a historic analysis relevant to the relation between State and CS. Although \n\nthere may be disagreement between the meaning of Civil Society in Africa\u2026\u201d (Chabal, 1986:14). \n\n \n\nThe authors cited above made the need to understand the notion of CS in southern societies clear,11 \n\nalthough in some arguments they have made it clear that there are areas of uncertainty about the \n\n                                                      \n11 Southern societies rise in the context of international relationships to designate the current social and economic \n\nconnections in place of the previous divisions of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd world countries.  In the opinion of Sorj (2005), the \n\nworld should accept the fact that there are contradictions as much in the perception as in the interests of CS (NGOs) \n\nfrom the south and the north in each national society. \n\nT \n\n\n\n \n\n 20 \n\nunderstanding of CS in Africa in the context of understanding democracy in relation to the state. It \n\nis therefore relevant to review the history of this concept on the African continent. \n\nIn the case of Mozambique, the focus of our study, the magnitude of literature about CS is \n\nassociated with the ideals of pan-Africanists and the struggle against the regimes in force during \n\nthe colonial period, which inspired the preparation of some Mozambican leaders in the formation \n\nof the new state (Francisco, 2010:51). \n\nThis situation allowed for the implementation of a single party system that put FRELIMO \n\n(the fruit of the merger between three nationalist regional movements, UDENAMO, MANU, and \n\nUNAMI) as the \u201conly and legitimate representative of the Mozambican People\u201d (Brito, 2009: 6). \n\nThe limitation of participation by CS in this phase of Mozambican history was considered by \n\nFrancisco et al., (2007:22), Brito (2009), and Francisco (2010:52) as being weak, given the political \n\nhegemony of the state as a party. Since then, associative life continued to observe different \n\ndynamics. In the 1980s, humanitarian organisation appeared, according Francisco (2010), as a \n\nconsequence of the occurrence of natural causes like drought, hunger, and worsening economic \n\nconditions. \n\nAfter the end of the civil war, the participation of CS in the country was highlighted as an \n\nurban phenomenon in the space nearest to the implementation of the republic. In this period, not \n\nonly did the regime change to a multiparty system, but also the armed conflict was resolved and \n\nthe pacification of the country in the short and long terms occurred (Sanches, 2014:63). \n\nIn the heat of a new situation inaugurated by the arrival of peace, Mozambique, a belligerent \n\nstate in conflict (1976-1992), opened its doors to a new political reality marked by the participation \n\nof people associated in a different manner (Van den Bergh, 2011)12. The author highlighted the \n\ninvolvement of the CCM and Catholic Church that marked a new scenario in the peace and \n\nreconciliation process of the country. Neves (2009) affirms that this period witnessed the organised \n\ncapacity of men and women, which extended itself to a new state. This movement was highlighted \n\n                                                      \n12 Lucia Van Den Bergh, a previous representative of the Association of European Parliaments for Africa (AWEPA), \n\non the new dynamics of some social organisations in the country. In her book, the author sets out frank and honest \n\nconversations with more than 50 people who took part in the peace, democracy, and political stability processes in \n\nMozambique, namely politicians, deputies, people that conducted the elections, and finally community and CS \n\norganisations. \n\n\n\n \n\n 21 \n\nfor allowing a recognition of men and women as social actors that showed their motivations for \n\nand defence of common causes. \n\nIt is within this conjecture that Gyimah-Boadi (1996), discussing CSOs including Christian \n\nassociations, considered that these were and/or are a strong contribution for the democratisation of \n\nAfrican countries. For the author, the renovation of and the interest for democracy gave impulse to \n\nCS as actors and forces to pressure political reforms on the continent after 1994, as was the case of \n\nNGOs. In the context of Mozambican politics, since the first multiparty elections of 1994 \u2013 as well \n\nas subsequent elections held in 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014 \u2013 the results always translated into a \n\nvictory for the FRELIMO party and RENAMO as the principal force of opposition. In 2009, a third \n\nparty appeared in the political context that interfered with the bipolar scenario dominated by \n\nFRELIMO and RENAMO: the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which managed \n\nto elect deputies (Sanches, 2014:48-53). \n\nIn 2012, 20 years after the signing of the General Peace Agreement and with the rising \n\nopposition of RENAMO, several incidences of violence linked to the discovery of mineral \n\nresources and the imminent signing of the contract for liquid petroleum gas (LPG) were recorded. \n\nIn this sequence of events, a ceasefire allowed for a dialogue between these party forces \u2013 \n\nFRELIMO and RENAMO \u2013 which was mediated by an international team, and RENAMO \n\ndemanded the nomination of provincial governors in the provinces rich in resources, where it \n\nclaimed to have won a majority in the national elections of 2009 (Macuane, Buur &amp; Monjane, \n\n2017). \n\nAccording to Sanches (2014), the 2014 elections were held in the country in a particularly \n\ndifficult context that revealed the weaknesses of the peace process and the democratisation of \n\nMozambique. \n\n \n\n4.2 Participation of NGO\u2019s in the Governance of Mozambique \n\n \n\nThe network of NGOs in Mozambique came about in the context of humanitarian assistance in the \n\n1980s. After that, the statute of national NGOs was approved in 1991 in the ambit of the multiparty \n\nConstitution of 1990 (Homerin, 2005). \n\nIn many African countries soon after the political transition in the beginning of the 1990s, \n\nthe relationships between the state and civil society changed to a more collaborative focus aimed \n\n\n\n \n\n 22 \n\nat development. According to Homerin (2005), in Mozambique, CS organisations such as NGOs \n\nand economic associations performed an important role in the state by creating partnerships, \n\nespecially in the areas of developing infrastructures and poverty reduction policies. NGOs are \n\nconsidered important actors of CS in Mozambique because they contribute to the consolidation and \n\ncapacitation of government actors with a view of strengthening joint actions and strengthening \n\npartnerships for development (Macuane et al., 2012). The nature of these organisations combines \n\nactivities that provide basic services with the promotion of citizenship. Taking into consideration \n\nthe fiscal challenges that NGOs face, Macuane et al., (2012) show that partnership with the \n\n\u201cgovernment\u201d is of extreme importance for the provision of services. \n\nIn this sense, in the Government of Mozambique\u2019s (PQG) 2010\u20132014 five-year plan, the \n\nMozambican government affirms that democracy imposes a respect for \u201cpolitical plurality\u201d and for \n\ndiverse \u201cforms of participation\u201d of the people in making decisions about matters of national \n\ninterest. \n\n \n\n4.3 Involvement of Mozambican CS from 2010 to 2014 \n\n \n\nIf we look at CS organisations as fundamental actors within a society, they become more active in \n\ninfluencing government decisions and acting in concert (Francisco, 2010). The author considers \n\nthat the basic question to be considered in the process of governing should be the representability \n\nand legitimacy of CSOs. \n\nIn the PQG (2010\u20132014) objectives defined by the government were set out with strict \n\ncollaboration with CS about political formations, religious confessions, the academic community, \n\nand all of the social actors, working to build a just and democratic society that is united and has the \n\nutmost tolerance for the following priority actions: \n\n(i) To reinforce the participation of CS in local development with special attention to \n\nconsolidation of local consultative councils. \n\n(ii) To promote partnerships with the organisations of CS to teach citizenship. \n\n(iii)  To reinforce the functioning of consultative local counsels to ensure popular participation, \n\nthe development of communities, and CS\u2019s activity in government. \n\n(iv)  To develop programmes that would assure the connection between literacy and informal \n\neducational programmes, in partnership with CS. \n\n\n\n \n\n 23 \n\n(v) To establish the mechanisms for permanent dialogue and the institutional co-ordination \n\nwith CS within the ambit of women and social action. \n\n(vi) To strengthen the participation of CS to monitor government action in order to combat \n\ncorruption by means of the capacitation of development observatories and district consulting \n\ncouncils. \n\n(vii) To ensure respect for human rights by means of sensitisation and divulgation actions, \n\ninvolving other actors/authors of CS in addition to state institutions. \n\n(viii) To make cross interventions from base structures, to consolidate public-private \n\npartnerships, and to work with CSOs, empowering these organisations for challenges that they \n\nmay face as they rise and permanently monitoring the evolution of efficiency of responses. \n\nFor Francisco (2007), CS could be considered an influencing factor for policies that are \n\nconducive to achieving good governance. On the side of the government, CS contributes to the \n\ndevelopment of a democratic state by means of concrete actions and the mobilisation of resources. \n\nIf we look at the emergence of the CS concept in the Mozambican context, we can confirm the \n\nexistence of various concessions for classification. Notions such as associative movements, non-\n\ngovernmental organisations, and religious associations apply to this concept. \n\nThese recent transformations in Mozambican society resulted in the citizens developing a \n\nconscience about their roles in the governing process, according to Brito (2014). The author states \n\nthat it is in this way that the uprisings of 2010 and the \u201cprotests\u201d of 2013 contributed to participation \n\nof CS in the monitoring of the government and pressuring the responsible government parties to \n\nbe accountable to society for the decisions made and the way in which they managed public funds \n\n(see Appendix B \u2013 the table highlights the cases in which the actions of CS resulted in legislative \n\nchanges in Mozambique). \n\nDuring the period of 2008 to 2014, Mozambique witnessed (i) social protests resulting from \n\nincreased living costs, namely for transport, basic products such as bread, electricity, and water, \n\nwhich marked the first sign of social and urban discontent about the government at the time (Revolt \n\nagainst Hunger) (Brito et al., 2015), and (ii) campaigns objecting to the ProSavana programme that \n\ninvolved CSOs from Mozambique, Brazil, and Japan (\u201cNo to ProSavana\u201d campaign; DW, 2014). \n\nRevolt against Hunger (2008/2013) \u2013 with the biggest concentration of protests in the cities \n\nof Maputo and Matola \u2013 were protests organised by popular groups on a micro scale and replicated \n\nafterwards in other cities in the country. According to Brito et al. (2015), the mobilisations of these \n\n\n\n \n\n 24 \n\nprotests took place by means of messages that circulated virally on mobile telephone networks and \n\nother means of communication, which resulted in the government finding it difficult to control the \n\nnature of the protests. The message of the protesters was about the increased cost of living and the \n\nrelationship between citizens and the state. \n\nThe absence of concrete means of communication made it very difficult to investigate who \n\nwas really behind these protests. Reflecting on the protagonists of the protests, Bussoti (2010) \n\nraises the first hypothesis that it dealt with a truly spontaneous protest. In fact, this hypothesis \n\npresents itself as a result of a vacuum in civil society, because the youth involved would not have \n\nhad the capacity to organise popular movements on such a significant and violent scale within the \n\ncountry. In the second hypothesis, the author raises the possibility of an \u201cinvisible hand\u201d, or even \n\nplanning through organising entities such as unions and opposition parties. \n\nThe campaign, No to ProSavana (2012-2015), was a reaction to the ProSavana programme, \n\nwhich is a tripartite co-operation programme for agricultural development of the tropical savannah \n\nin Mozambique. It started in 2011 with resources from the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (BCA), \n\nJapanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Institutes of Agrarian Investigation of \n\nMozambique (IAIM) (Fingermann, 2013). \n\nThe project includes the principles of \u201cSouth-South Cooperation\u201d13 held by the Brazilian \n\ngovernment at the time, which was led by former Brazilian president Lula da Silva. In his empirical \n\nstudy, Fingermann (2013) refers to the campaign, No to ProSavana, and included organisations \n\nseen in the provinces of Niassa, Nampula, and Zambezia (in the centre and north of the country) \n\nthat protested against the implementation of the programme. It is in this way that, based on excerpts \n\nof a conversation with members of the National Union of Peasants in Niassa, DW (2014) confirms \n\nthat \u201csecrecy, omission, manipulation, criminalisation, deliberate disturbance of peace of \n\ncontradicting documents as well as the manipulation of leaders of peasant organisations\u201d were the \n\nsource of the protests on behalf of CS. \n\nThe CS groups developed from a role of merely holding the government accountable to one \n\nof being active participants in research and advocacy (Francisco et al., 2007), contributing to \n\ngreater pressure over the state and international institutions, which in turn contributed to improving \n\npolitics within Mozambican society. It is within this guiding spirit of research that we endeavour \n\n                                                      \n13 South-South Cooperation is based on the horizontal relationship between developing countries looking to find new \n\nways to cooperate on values and premises that would draw them away from the new paradigm of globalisation and \n\ndevelopment (Bueno, Faria &amp; Bermudez., 2013). \n\n\n\n \n\n 25 \n\nto explore this evolution of CS organisations, specifically those that are associated in a joint fashion \n\nand represented through platforms and forums, and even more specifically those that were involved \n\nin drafting the Mining Law 20/2014 and the Petroleum Law 21/2014. \n\n \n\n4.4 Extractive Industries in Mozambique versus Platforms and Forums (2010-2014) \n\n \n\nIn the literature on extractive industries in Mozambique, there are at least two perspectives to keep \n\nin mind: on the one hand, that of Mussagy (2015), which puts forward the fact that the capacity for \n\nforeign investment and the exploitation of natural resources must be determining factors for \n\nelevating the economic growth potential of Mozambique, and on the other hand, that of Castel-\n\nBranco (2009), who, in his study of the development and challenges of mineral resources in relation \n\nto extractive industries in Mozambique, highlights \u201ccreating environmental awareness\u201d in relation \n\nto natural resources by virtue of these only being renewable when there is a balance between the \n\nrate of production and the rate of extraction or exploitation. \n\nThese two topics related to extractive industries in Mozambique lead to the ideas of \n\nAaronson (2011: 50-53), according to whom there is the need for citizens to be the principal \n\nbeneficiaries of the extraction and sale of resources while they still exist. For the author, who cites \n\nexamples of countries like Nigeria, Mali, and Peru, the need for transparency in the area of \n\nextractive industries places organisation of CS and NGOs (local and non-local) as key players in \n\nthe preservation of mineral resources. \n\nOther authors, such as Frei, Chaveiro &amp; Macaringue (2016), point out the danger of \n\nappropriation and expropriation of mineral territories in Mozambique, because these practices \n\nbenefit the holders of the capital that \u201c(re)organise the local territories with the purpose of slowing \n\ndown the demands of capitalist development\u201d, prejudicing the local communities that are taken \n\naway from their zones and thus giving rise to land and natural resource conflicts in their survival \n\nbase. \n\nAccording to the newspaper Not\u00edcias (07/26/2014), citing the previous Minister of Mineral \n\nResources (who is the regulating authority of this sector) speaking at the presentation of the \n\nproposed revision of the Mining Law, the discovery of large reserves of minerals put the country \n\non a national and international trajectory that would impose the need for adjusting the legislation \n\nin force prior to 2014. At this time in the country and on the continent, the debate about the need \n\n\n\n \n\n 26 \n\nfor all public and private actors intensified, and the communities each performed roles to guarantee \n\nthat the discovery and the exploitation of natural resources would in fact be a blessing and not a \n\ncurse (AR-VII/Parecer/379/16.07.2014). \n\nThis scenario of new discoveries of mineral resources dictated the expansion and growth \n\nof investments that were supported by a legal regime that directed mining activity, namely law \n\n14/2002 of 26 June, the Mining law, and its regulations approved by Decree n\u00ba 26/2004 of 20 \n\nAugust, Decree n\u00ba 62/2006 of 26 December, and Decree n\u00ba 20/2011 of 1 June. \n\nThe prospects of the extractive industries sector were very much contested by RENAMO. \n\nThe biggest opposition party considered that the discovery of resources would benefit only the \n\npolitical elite close to the ruling party; therefore, it demanded much more transparency in the \n\nmanagement of the resources. In their studies, Macuane, Buur &amp; Monjane (2017), citing Gordon \n\n(2015), allege that the discovery of these resources was the direct consequence of the return to \n\nconflict. In addition, other authors such as Green &amp; Otto (2014) highlight the fact that certain types \n\nof natural resources were being discovered in zones of RENAMO\u2019s influence, which were situated \n\ntowards the north of the country where the opposition had gathered more votes. \n\nAccording to the IMF (2014), it is within this international juncture that the growth of the \n\nextractive industries made it necessary for the country to join the Initiative for Transparency in the \n\nExtractive Industries (EITI),14 taking into account that clear principles that assured greater \n\ntransparency, equity, and sustainability in the exploitation of mineral resources were necessary. In \n\naddition, in 2012, Mozambique was considered to be in full compliance with the EITI, complying \n\nwith the 2010 report (IMF, 2014). \n\nSince this natural resource boom in Mozambique in the mid-2000s, authors such as \n\nSelemane (2009) showed the need for public access to information on the transactions related to \n\nnatural resources and, fundamentally, for fiscal transparency. For this reason, organisations like \n\nthe CIP, a \u201cpioneering organism highlighting the Extractive Industry since 2007 and launching \n\npublications about the sector in the country\u201d, Institute of Social and Economic Studies (IESE), \n\nObservatory of Rural Means (OMR), Terra Viva Center (CTV), and platforms and forums \n\n                                                      \n14 EITI is a global initiative of a voluntary character launched in 2002 by the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair \n\naimed at improving governance in countries rich in mineral resources by means of the verification and publication of \npayments from companies and income collected by governments in the oil, gas, and mineral sectors (source: \n\nhttp://www.itie.org.mz/index.php/iniciativa/que-e-itie).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 27 \n\nconnected to the extractive industry have shown the need for good governance in the sector by \n\nmeans of debates, lobbying work, and practical advocacy for transparency (Selemane, S/D). \n\nAccording to Nipassa (2017), the years from 2003 to 2005 were marked by the rise of some \n\nof these organisations congregating in networks of platforms and forums in Mozambique. For the \n\nauthor, platforms and forums often represented spaces created to establish communication between \n\nCS, the government, and donors capable of influencing the development of public policies. \n\nSince then, from 2007 onwards, platforms and forums aimed at the natural resources and \n\nextractive industries sectors appeared in the country, including Consultations about Forestry, \n\nForum of Community Maintenance of Natural Resources, Friends of Forests, G20, JOINT, Forest \n\nDialogue, National Forum of Biofuels, Platform of Climate Change, and Forum of Conservation, \n\nwhich work in specific sectors or on specific topics. \n\nEach one of these mechanisms that unites a \u2013 generally small \u2013 group of NGOs and that \n\nbelongs to a network of platforms or forums has shown the need for the government to open up \n\nand show transparency in the management of resources. In this respect, Table 4.4.1 mentions the \n\nplatforms, forums, and NGOs linked to the natural resources and extractive industries in \n\nMozambique. \n\n \n\nTable 4.4.1: Platforms, forums, and NGOs linked to the natural resources and extractive \n\nindustries (source: http://www.wwf.org.mz/oportunidades/consultoria/index.cfm) \n\n \n\nActive platforms Civil Society Platform on Natural Resources and Extractive \n\nIndustries, Consultation Forum on Land, Consultation Forum on \n\nForests, Community Forum on Resource Management, ROSA, \n\nJOINT, Forest Dialogue, Platform on Climate Change and \n\nConservation Forum. \n\nExisting and not very active \n\nPlatforms \n\nFriends of Forests, G20, National Biofuels Forum, LINK \n\nProvincial platforms Sofala, Manica, Zamb\u00e9zia, Nampula, Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Tete.  \n\nNGOs CTV, UNAC, ORAM, IUCN, CIP, KUHUKA, RUTH, \n\nSEKELEKANI, IESE, LIVANINGO, WWF, CARE, OXFAM, \n\nSAVE THE CHILDREN, SNV, RADEZA, KWAEDZA, SIMUKAI, \n\nWE EFFECT, LUPA. \n\n \n\nhttp://www.wwf.org.mz/oportunidades/consultoria/index.cfm\n\n\n \n\n 28 \n\n4.5 Platforms of CS on the Natural Resources and Extractive Industries versus the \n\nProposed Mining Law and Petroleum Law \n\n \n\nThe revision of the Petroleum Law published in 2012 highlighted the need for enriching the \n\nPetroleum Law, 3/2001 to better attend to the needs of the global petroleum industry (RL, 2012). \n\nFor Nuvunga (2013), the proposal would constitute an important step in the preparation for \n\nthe extractive industries sector to face the challenges that were approaching, in response to the \n\nneeds of the government and the interests of petroleum companies, since the revision allowed for \n\nthe incorporation of important aspects linked to the questions of infrastructure, the sharing of \n\nincome, control and the protection of the environment (Abrahamson et al., 2013). \n\nAccording to Nuvunga (2013), this revision came about as a consequence of the discovery \n\nof natural gas in the Rovuma basin and the resulting prospects for the production of liquid natural \n\ngas (LNG), which would present a challenge for Mozambique in the process of reformulating its \n\nlegal framework \u201cin order to guarantee that new challenges for the sector were achieved in a secure, \n\njust and efficient way so as to attend to the needs of the country\u201d (Abrahamson et al., 2013). \n\nAt the time, the proposal made available by the Ministry of Mineral Resources (MMR) \n\nstarted a \u201cdebate\u201d linked to the proposed Petroleum Law. In this logic, appeals from CS were made \n\nregarding the need for transparent governance and open public debates due to the strategic \n\nimportance of extractive industries in the socioeconomic development of Mozambique (Nuvunga, \n\n2013). \n\nStill in 2012, the government presented a proposal to revise the Mining Law, preceded by \n\na process of collecting contributions whose debates were about mining activity for the income of \n\nstates, the inclusion of participation of Mozambicans in mining exploration, and the activities of \n\nrendering services to companies in the sector. Following the publication of the proposed revision \n\nof the Mining Law in 2012, the CIP (2012) made a general evaluation of the draft of the Mining \n\nLaw that expressed the need for well crafted questions and the systematisation of the content and \n\ndrafting. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 29 \n\nCHAPTER 5 \n\n THE MAKING OF THE MINING AND PETROLEUM LAWS: VIEWS FROM \n\nKEY ACTORS IN CIVIL SOCIETY  \n\n \n\nhis chapter presents evidence on the interviews (see Appendix C for a script of the \n\ninterviews) carried out, seeking to depict the nature of relations between key actors in \n\ncivil society, and the relevant government actors. Thus, we will make a characterisation \n\nof the CS organisations that participated in the advocacy and lobbying campaigns aimed \n\nat approving the Mining Law and Petroleum Law (some of which were part of the Platform on \n\nMineral Resources and Extractive Industries) and debate the question of the relationship between \n\nCS and the government, especially in the case of the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law. \n\n \n\n5.1 Characterisation of the Organisations that Were Interviewed \n\n \n\nSix organisation that form part of the Platform on Natural Resources and the Extractive Industries, \n\nwhich carried some weight in the approval of the Mining Law and the Petroleum law approved in \n\n2014, and one organisation (WLSA) that participated in the advocacy campaign were selected \n\n(CIP, CTV, AENA, WWF, AMA, and AAAJC). \n\nThe organisations that were interviewed had different levels of involvement in the \n\ncampaigns. \n\nAccording to F\u00e1tima Mimbiri,15 in the area of the extractive industries, CIP, while a private \n\nlaw collective and legal entity endowed with legal personality, \u201cseeks to promote Good \n\nGovernance of resources, it presupposes that the Government will sign contracts that are fair and \n\nbeneficial for the country. To achieve these objectives, the CIP uses a system of naming and \n\nshaming to highlight bad practices, whether of public servants, or of companies, and above all \n\nexposes the appetites of the political elite that end up influencing government decisions\u201d. \n\nRegarding characterisations of these organisations, it is possible to confirm that the CIP \n\nuses engagement with institutions \u2013 above all \u2013 in a platform of dialogue about the political \n\nproposals and reforms that the entity possesses (Mimbiri, 2017). \n\n                                                      \n15 F\u00e1tima Mimbiri is responsible for the extractive industries division of the CIP and answered the questionnaire about \n\nthe involvement of CS in the approval of the Mining Law and Petroleum Law. \n\nT \n\n\n\n \n\n 30 \n\nThe CTV acts throughout Mozambique. Its objectives are \u201cto contribute to a better \n\ntechnical-scientific foundation for environmental decisions so that the appeals for public \n\nparticipation in environmental management included in policies, strategies, and in national \n\nenvironmental legislation are positively received by a CS with capacity to make informed and \n\nrelevant contributions in that area\u201d.16 \n\nAENA is an organisation that promotes the sustainable management and governance of \n\nnatural resources in a way that facilitates the socioeconomic development of rural communities by \n\nmeans of strengthening capacity, as well as creating and sharing knowledge. \n\nThe objective of WWF, which is an organisation with almost five million associates spread \n\nover five continents and with a presence in Mozambique, is to stop the degradation of the planet \n\nand to promote the conservation of biodiversity, the reduction of pollution and of waste, and to \n\nassure the sustainability of natural resources. \n\nAMA is an environmental association created in 1990 by a group of youths in the city of \n\nPemba, Cabo Delgado in the north of Mozambique, which has one of the biggest natural gas \n\nreserves in the world. With the objective of safeguarding natural resources, the Association Friends \n\nof the Environment is a reference for the sensitisation and strengthening of communities in the \n\nmanagement of natural resources and the environment, and it is made up of more than seventy \n\nmembers of different origins. In addition to participating in big strategical decisions related to the \n\nmanagement of natural resources and the environment, the interventions of the organisation are \n\ncentred on the strengthening mechanisms of community participation and consulting in \n\ndecentralised planning. \n\nAAAJC is an organisation that transmits its interests by means of initiatives in processes \n\nthat are generally conducted in networks of platforms with other CSO partners. WLSA is an \n\norganisation that views the empowerment of women in the sense of bringing about changes in the \n\nlaw, public policies, access to the administration of justice, and social practices so that women may \n\nhave the means and opportunities to combat discrimination. \n\n \n\n                                                      \n16 Manuela Wing is responsible for the Education and Environment Information programme and answered the \n\nquestionnaire about the involvement of CS in the approval of the Mining Law and Petroleum Law. \n\n\n\n \n\n 31 \n\n5.2 The Relationship Between CS and the Government: the Case of the Mining Law and \n\nPetroleum Law \n\n \n\nThis subchapter describes the themes considered pertinent to the relationship between CS and the \n\ngovernment in the case of the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law. For this analysis, we take into \n\naccount a set of questions that will help us tackle the general objectives of the research, namely (i) \n\nto understand the acting mechanisms between CS and the government in political decisions in \n\nMozambique and (ii) to classify the types of existing relationships between CS and the government \n\nin political decisions in Mozambique.  \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Mechanisms Through Which Civil Society and Government Act: the Case of the \n\nMining Law and Petroleum Law Approved in 2014 \n\n \n\nIn the first year of the 2010\u20132014 legislature, as in prior mandates, the Government of Mozambique \n\nwas the entity that made the most submissions for the approval of laws by the Parliament. For \n\nexample, in 2010 in its first session of the VII legislature of the Assembly of the Republic, it made \n\n29 legal initiatives, of which 16 came from the government and only 13 from the parties with seats \n\nin the Assembly of the Republic (Banze, 2011). \n\nIn the first year of the VII legislature, the RENAMO parliamentary caucus led the legal \n\ninitiatives by presenting 11 legal projects, which is a productivity rate of 68.75%. Notwithstanding \n\nthe fact that it was the majoritarian party, FRELIMO presented 25% of the proposed laws, while \n\nthe MDM presented 6.25% (Banze, 2011). \n\nAccording to the newspaper Not\u00edcias on 07/26/2014, during the same mandate, revisions \n\nto the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law were proposed as an initiative of the government. In \n\nfact, this was an important topic in the political agenda, and the official discourse was one of \n\ntransparency and commitment with international standards and also of the need of protecting \n\nnational interests. The following statements of the Former Minister of Mineral Resources \n\nEsperan\u00e7a Bias, are illustrative of this:  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 32 \n\nThe Government is legislating so there are no marginal negotiations, so that everything is done in \n\ncompliance with the legislation. The contracts are public today, everyone has access to them, and it \n\nis all on the Ministry's website17. \n\n \n\nThe assignment of rights for the initiation of extraction activities will respect national interests in \n\nrelation to the defence, navigation, research and conservation of marine resources, existing \n\neconomic activities and the environment in general18 \n\n \n\nThe proposed revision of the Mining Law that contained 68 articles and occurred 12 years after the \n\napproval of the first Mining Law. For the government, this proposal attempted to introduce other \n\nterms and conditions for the transfer of mining rights as a way of allowing the state to collect fair \n\nincome by virtue of these rights and harmonising it with international best practices. In accordance \n\nwith the aforementioned newspaper, this law was generally approved by the FRELIMO \n\nparliamentary caucus with 152 votes, and with 4 votes from the MDM bench and 43 abstentions \n\nfrom RENAMO.  \n\n \n\nIn this first phase of the process, CS did not participate; in fact, even in the critical/final phases \n\nof the process, there was a \u201cclosure\u201d of the government, forcing some CS organisations such as \n\nthe CIP to look for other forms to be involved in the process (Mimbiri, CIP). \n\n \n\nThus, a process started that consisted of a public battle to achieve greater transparency in contracts \n\nfor the exploitation of natural resources. We will discuss these strategies that CSOs used in the \n\nprocess that culminated in the approval of the Mining Law and the Petroleum Law in 2014 in detail \n\nand support them with testimonies of the organisations involved in this study. \n\n \n\nIn the case of WWF Mozambique, \u201cthe organisation attempted to guarantee the biggest reach in \n\npublic participation and active participation by means of critical reading and observations or \n\ncontributions to enrich the legislation\u201d (Pequenino, WWF). \n\n \n\n                                                      \n17 https://www.publico.pt/2014/09/21/mundo/entrevista/esperanca-bias-a-bacia-do-rovuma-ainda-tem-muito-\npara-dar-1670042 (accessed on 12/12/2017)  \n18 http://www.jornalnoticias.co.mz/index.php/politica/20980-producao-de-gas-e-petroleo-ar-estabelece-quota-\npara-consumo-interno.html (accessed on 12/12/2017). \n\nhttps://www.publico.pt/2014/09/21/mundo/entrevista/esperanca-bias-a-bacia-do-rovuma-ainda-tem-muito-para-dar-1670042\nhttps://www.publico.pt/2014/09/21/mundo/entrevista/esperanca-bias-a-bacia-do-rovuma-ainda-tem-muito-para-dar-1670042\nhttp://www.jornalnoticias.co.mz/index.php/politica/20980-producao-de-gas-e-petroleo-ar-estabelece-quota-para-consumo-interno.html\nhttp://www.jornalnoticias.co.mz/index.php/politica/20980-producao-de-gas-e-petroleo-ar-estabelece-quota-para-consumo-interno.html\n\n\n \n\n 33 \n\nAt this level, WWF assumed its role based on the definition and preference of its strategies within \n\nthis political context. Thus, for the participants, both in the government and in CS, the change of \n\nthe legislature would be an important gain for the Mozambican State given the new challenges that \n\nwere dawning. \n\n \n\nThe National Association of Rural Extension (AENA) was one of the CS organisations that \u201cmade \n\nconcrete proposals to the government to appeal for the use of means of rural communication in \n\nthe process of sharing information that could contribute to the participation of communities\u201d \n\n(AENA). \n\nAENA also proposed \u201clegislation on the benefits for Mozambicans in contracts for the \n\nexploitation of natural resources, the relevant compensation of improvements, decent \n\nresettlements, corporate social responsibility, environmental questions, and forms of checking on \n\nthe government\u201d (AENA).  \n\n \n\nIn the meantime, this process was characterised as being regressive on the part of the government. \n\n \n\nThus, civil society (in the case of CIP) had to go after the Parliament (Mimbiri, CIP). \n\n \n\nBy means of the platform of organisations of civil society on the natural resources and extractive \n\nindustries, the organisations united and contacted the government. Therefore, from the formal point \n\nof view, the platform became an institutional actor in the process. \n\n \n\nThe actors made \u201cuse of newspapers to share the information about public consultations and sent \n\nletters to request contributions from institutions that have, as their mission, supporting the \n\ngovernment to improve the legislative process  (Wing, CTV). \n\n \n\nIn the meantime, the CSOs continued to put pressure, and to voice discontent with the way the \n\nprocess way being carried out. For example, during the revision of the Petroleum Law: \n\n \n\nThere was no public consultation, as happened during the Mining Law and fiscal laws. And the \n\nCIP exposed the government critically and publicly (Mimbiri, CIP). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 34 \n\nThrough the testimonies of the members of the organisations interviewed, we could confirm that \n\nthere were no restrictions from a legal point of view on these organisations taking part in the \n\nprocess. The organisations used strategies and mechanisms for action, namely expressing their \n\nviews vividly and openly through newspapers and reaching out to their networks in the platform. \n\nDespite the number of engaged CSOs being relatively small, compared to the number of existing \n\norganisations in the country, we could observe sings proactivity and horizontal cooperation in the \n\nbehaviour of the entities taking part in this process. \n\nTo analyse the nature of the typology of the relationship between CS and the government, \n\nit is important to have this background in mind; that CSOs were active and particularly interested \n\nin the political, economic, and environmental implications (among others) of the Mining and \n\nPetroleum Laws. In the following section the positioning of the government in this process is \n\npresented. \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Levels of Receptivity of the Government in Relation to CS \n\n \n\nIn response to the proactivity of CSOs, the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MIREME), \n\nat the time headed by Esperan\u00e7a Bias, and the tax authority became the direct interlocutors of the \n\nplatform. \n\n \n\nNaturally, because it is a proponent of mining and petroleum legislation (AENA).  \n\n \n\nThis way, it started a connection in the formal communication during the process. As a result of the \n\npressure from civil society and the publication of articles, promotion of debates, organisation \n\nof seminars, lobby, and an intense campaign of advocacy afterwards, on 3 December 2013, the \n\ngovernment announced the publication of contracts for the exploration of natural resources. \n\nEven so, the National Association of Rural Extension (AENA), an organisation taking part in \n\nthe platform: \n\n \n\n(..) highlighted the need for transparency relating to the documents that give an account of the \n\nparticipation of Mozambicans in the exploration contracts (those that had 5% of the shares). \n\n(AENA). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 35 \n\nAENA was interested in knowing who these Mozambicans that held such a percentage were: \n\n  \n\n\u201cthe value of the income that would be channelled into the communities, the question of fair \n\ncompensation (what was meant by fair how did it apply, that is, the regulation), as well as the \n\nrole of the High Authority of the Extractive Industries,19 which could not be subordinated to the \n\nMinistry of Natural Resources, but indeed to the Assembly of the Republic\u201d (AENA). \n\n \n\nThis preoccupation was also highlighted by the Association for the Legal Support and Assistance \n\nto Communities (AAAJC). \n\n \n\nFor AAAJC, there was a conflict between CS and the government in relation to the entity under \n\nwhich the High Authority should be held accountable, because the government wanted the High \n\nAuthority of the Extractive Industries to be subordinated to the Council of Ministers, while the \n\nCS wanted it to be subordinated to Parliament, considering that this was the organ representing \n\nthe people. The existence of this conflict made it clear that the influence of the government is \n\nvery strong. The Parliament never pronounced its stance on this topic referring to the creation of \n\nthe High Authority of the Extractive Industries (Chucate, AAAJC \n\n \n\nAlthough WLSA did not contribute with any exact proposal regarding the drafting of the laws, \n\nthe organisation was involved in the dissemination activities and participated in the advocacy \n\ncampaign, performing:  \n\n \n\n(\u2026) interviews with provincial directors for the environment, energy, finance, education, health, \n\nand permanent secretaries on provincial and district levels (AENA). \n\n \n\nAfter a cycle of negotiations between the government and the platform, on 18 August 2014 the \n\nMining Law was approved. In light of this it becomes pertinent to look at the attitude of the parties \n\ninvolved in this process. Some of the testimonies collected suggest that the government eventually \n\nrecognized the role of CSOs: \n\n                                                      \n19 At the time of the approval of the Mining Law, the Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique created a High \n\nAuthority for the Extractive Industry, an entity that should have been established by the government by the end of \n\n2015. The role of the AAIE is summarised as the oversight of the mineral resources coming from extractive industries \n\n(source: http://www.verdade.co.mz/destaques/democracia/54863-alta-autoridade-da-industria-extractiva-deve-ser-\n\nindependente) \n\n\n\n \n\n 36 \n\n \n\nYes, the government has come to recognise civil society contribution to the contributions that \n\nhave been made in this process (WWF). \n\n \n\nYes, strategically it was necessary that this be done (AMA).  \n\n \n\nTthe government recognised that the proposed laws were drafted by means of a broad \n\nconsultation of civil society, the private sector, and other intervening parties without, however, \n\nhighlighting only one sector (AENA). \n\n \n\nCounter to this Mimbiri (CIP) stated that the government did not recognise the role of CS, while \n\nthe Parliament acknowledged their importance, so much so that the Committee on Constitutional \n\nAffairs, Human Rights and the Committee on Agriculture, Economy and Environment issued \n\nstatements about the involvement of CS. By way of example, the latter Committee:  \n\n \n\nReceived the CIP about the reformulation of article 7 of the Mining Law that was taken into \n\nconsideration20 (Mimbiri, CIP). \n\n \n\nAs mentioned in the methodological section, it was not possible to rely on testimonies from \n\nthe key governing actors engaged in this process to countervail some of these views. Still the \n\nevidence collected on the side of CSOs allows us to draw some tentative conclusions on the nature \n\nof interactions between CSOs and the government. In fact, CSOs were quite proactive and engaged \n\nin series of actions to try and influence the law making process. The role of CSOs seemed to have \n\nbeen recognised at some point by the government and also by the parliamentary committees.  \n\nEpisodes of direct confrontation or of co-optation were not conveyed in the interviews: both sides \n\nseemed to have followed non-overlapping strategies but aimed at a similar outcome \u2013 to create \n\nmore effective and transparent laws to regulate the extractive sector. This means that the nature of \n\nCSOs and government relations were closer to the complementarity ideal type. We develop this \n\npoint further in the concluding section.   \n\n                                                      \n20 Article 7 of the Mining Law relates to mining contracts and mentions state participation in mining activities, local \n\nminimum content, a plan for technical professional training, a memorandum of understanding between companies, \n\nlocal government, and communities, and dispute resolution mechanisms (AR-VII/Parecer/379/16.07.2014) \n\n\n\n \n\n 37 \n\nCHAPTER 6  \n\n CONCLUSION AND FUTURE INVESTIGATION \n\n \n\nhe last chapter of this dissertation presents the conclusion, where we reflect on the \n\nrelationship between CS and the government, which, in context of our analysis, is \n\nclassified as predominantly of \u201ccomplementarity\u201d. Firstly, we present the main results \n\nof the study depicting the interactions between the CS and the government and the \n\nformal arrangements made by CS to help its proposals get the attention of the government. \n\nSecondly, we reflect on the implications of this study for further research.  \n\n \n\n6.1 Conclusion \n\n \n\nThe analysis conducted in the preceding pages sought to examine the nature of CS and government \n\nrelations in the context of a hybrid regime.  \n\nFocusing on the Mozambique, we highlighted the signing of the General Peace Agreement \n\nas an important mark, because it created the political, social and legal conditions for the emergence \n\nand development of a new CS. Over time there has been a considerable increase in the number of \n\nCSOs, but we still know little about the nature of their interaction with the state. \n\nSeeking to help fill in this lacuna, this study was oriented towards a deeper research of the \n\nparticipation of the Mozambican CS in governance. The CS has played a pivotal role in the recent \n\npolitical history of Mozambique, namely promoting peace and political change, monitoring the \n\nquality of elections, advocating for human rights and for good governance.  \n\nNevertheless, this participation of CS was always reinforced to the degree that new \n\nchallenges were imposed on the Mozambican state. It is within this context of new challenges that \n\nthe Government of Mozambique and CS came across the discovery of natural resources in 2000, \n\nwhich resulted in the Council of Ministers of Mozambique proposing a revision of the Mining and \n\nPetroleum Laws. \n\nTherefore, our focus of investigation was about the participation of CS in the government, \n\nspecifically when the Mining Law and Petroleum Law were approved in 2014. We wanted to know \n\nwhat the nature of the relationship between civil society and the government was during the process \n\nT \n\n\n\n \n\n 38 \n\nof formulation and approval of these laws. For this purpose, we collected testimonies from seven \n\nkey organisations. \n\nThe organisations interviewed considered that the process was not easy: they had to be \n\nproactive and coordinate action, this resulted in a series of advocacy and lobbying campaigns \n\ncarried out both individually or organised through the platform concerning the natural resources \n\nand extractive industries. \n\nDuring the investigation, two aspects come across as relevant. On one hand, the principle \n\nof good governance that is patent in the government\u2019s 2010\u20132014 five-year plan, which reaffirms \n\nthis strict collaboration with CS organisations. On the other hand, during the mandate led by \n\nArmando Em\u00edlio Guebuza soon after the publication of the revisions of the laws mentioned, CS \n\nand government institutions sought to affirm a continued role of responsibility before the \n\ngovernment. In society in general, this situation aroused an interest in questions regarding \n\nparticipation in decision making and even about the necessity for transparency in the management \n\nof resources, which was a very important factor that marked the participation of CS. \n\nIn the process of the approval of the Mining and Petroleum Laws, a factor of extreme \n\nimportance that highlighted the participation of CS was the communication between the \n\ngovernment and CS (a pertinent point considered in this investigation). \n\nThe big objective of the investigation was to understand the nature of relationship between \n\nthe CS and government. We came to the conclusion that the typology that best illustrates the \n\ninteractions in the case study herein is \u201ccomplementarity\u201d. This is so, because CS and the \n\nMozambican government both relied in different strategies but wanted effective laws to be \n\napproved. This is not to say that there were not of \u201ctension\u201d; in fact, according to AAAJC, the \n\nprocess was marked by some episodes of divergence between CS and the government in relation \n\nto the entity to which the High Authority of the Extractive Industry should be accountable. \n\nHowever the process was more characterised by complementary elements than confrontational \n\nones. The associations mentioned, in the case of CIP and AAAJC, pointed to the way in which the \n\ngovernment positioned itself for not recognising the role of CS in the process, while the \n\nparliamentary committees proved more hospitable. Other CSOs however, stated that there was \n\nrecognition from the government.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 39 \n\n6.2 Perspectives for Future Investigation \n\n \n\nFrom these collected experiences in the case study, this research can contribute to the improvement \n\nof governance in Mozambique. We believe that future studies about these themes should better \n\nexplore the means of communication of CS and the strategies that CS utilises to reach its objectives. \n\nAs far as advocacy and lobbying strategies are concerned, one can question whether CS deals with \n\na viable strategy or whether it largely reaches its objectives as far as the approval of laws are \n\nconcerned.  \n\nThe present study sheds light about the relationships between CS and the government in a \n\nkey sector of the Mozambican economy. However, up to what point does this apply to other areas? \n\nFuture studies employing a comparative approach and utilizing more data, are necessary to provide \n\na more satisfactory answer to these questions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 40 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n 41 \n\n BIBLIOGRAPHY  \n\n \n\nAaronson, S.

If so, \n\nwhich ones? \n\n5- Have you sought \n\nto coordinate your \n\npositions in a \n\nbroader dialogue \n\nwith other CSOs? \n\nIf so, which ones? \n\nCIP  In the area of extractive industry is to \n\npromote good governance of resources, \n\nwhich presuppose that the government signs \n\nfair and beneficial contracts for the country, \n\nthe country taxes properly and fairly, and \n\ncommunities are treated in a way that is \n\nconducive to the rights it has according to \n\nthe law and with dignity. In order to achieve \n\nthese objectives, CIP produces analysis texts \n\non the decisions taken by the government, as \n\nwell as on the processes, as well as \n\nproposals for reforms that are necessary to \n\nimprove the management of the country's \n\nmineral resources. Likewise, the CIP uses a \n\n\"name and shame\" approach, but practices \n\nboth public servants and companies and \n\nabove all denounces the appetites of the \n\npolitical elite that end up influencing \n\ngovernment decisions. \n\nI can only speak on \n\nbehalf of the CIP, \n\nalthough we know that \n\nother organizations have \n\nalso participated / been \n\ninvolved. \n\nThe CIP actively \n\nparticipated in the \n\nprocess of revising the \n\nlaws, whether \n\nparticipating in public \n\nconsultations or in \n\ndialogue with relevant \n\ngovernment entities and \n\nparliamentary \n\ncommittees in the \n\nprocess of reviewing \n\nlegislation.

The member organizations \n\nare organized in Platforms - in this case \n\nthere is a Platform of Civil Society \n\nOrganizations for the Extractive Industry \n\nand Natural Resources, recognized as a valid \n\ninterlocutor with the Mozambican \n\ngovernment and extractive industry \n\ncompanies \n\nThe level of \n\ninvolvement of \n\norganizations such as \n\nWWF Mozambique was \n\nto ensure that there was \n\nas wide a scope as \n\npossible in the process \n\nof public hearings and \n\nactive participation \n\nthrough reading and \n\ncritical remarks or \n\ncontributions to enrich \n\nlegislation. WWF \n\nMozambique, in \n\ncoordination with other \n\ncivil society \n\norganizations, secured \n\nthrough work meetings \n\nthe collection of \n\nsubsidies and \n\ncontributions during the \n\nprocess in which the \n\nmining and oil and gas \n\nlaws were being drafted \n\nuntil their submission to \n\nthe Mozambican \n\nParliament. \n\nThe \n\ncommunication \n\nchannels used \n\nduring the \n\ndrafting of these \n\nlaws were \n\nworkshops, \n\nround tables, \n\nseminars, e-\n\nmails, informal \n\nmeetings among \n\nthe key actors in \n\nthe process \n\nThe means used \n\nwere Workshops \n\nor working \n\nmeetings with \n\nrepresentatives of \n\nthe stakeholders \n\nwhere each side \n\npresented their \n\npoints of view and \n\ngave the \n\nopportunity for \n\nothers to \n\ncomment.

The \n\nprocesses in a \n\nfund are only to \n\nformalize a \n\nprocess that has \n\nalready been \n\ndecided by the \n\ntechnicians \n\nhired by the \n\nGovernment, \n\nwho in most \n\ncases carry out \n\nextrapolations \n\nwith the \n\nappropriate \n\nadaptations of \n\nlaws of our \n\nlegal neighbors, \n\nsuch as \n\nPortugal, RSA \n\nand very \n\nrecently Brazil . \n\nThe Government does \n\nnot see any use in the \n\nactivities of the CS, so \n\nvery recently it had \n\nproduced a proposal to \n\nrevise the Law of \n\nAssociations without \n\naccepting any of CS \n\ncontributions, the main \n\ninterested party. \n\nFortunately, the \n\nConstitutional Court \n\nconsidered this \n\nproposal \n\nunconstitutional. \n\nThe only known role \n\nrepresented by \n\nParliament was the \n\nadoption of the Laws \n\nin question. To give an \n\nexample that the \n\nparliament was not \n\nvery committed to the \n\nprocess, look for the \n\nart. 25 of the Mining \n\nLaw, which provides \n\nfor the creation of the \n\nHigh Authority of the \n\nExtractive Industry. \n\nThere is a conflict \n\nbetween CS and the \n\nGovernment regarding \n\nthe entity under which \n\nthe High Authority is \n\naccountable. The \n\nGovernment wants it \n\nto be the Council of \n\nMinisters; while the \n\nCS wants it to be \n\nunder Parliament, \n\nsince this body is the \n\nrepresentative of the \n\npeople. Parliament has \n\nnot spoken on the \n\nsubject, which \n\nsuggests that the \n\ninfluence of the \n\nGovernment is quite \n\nstrong. \n\nWWF The level of reception \n\nwas generally positive \n\nbut not all the \n\nMIREME Not applicable Civil Society \n\nwas proactive \n\nbut the \n\nIt was a relatively \n\npeaceful process. \n\nThere have been some \n\nYes, the government \n\nhas come to recognize \n\ncivil society \n\n\n\n \n\n 59 \n\nrecommendations \n\nmade were accepted \n\nand integrated into the \n\nfinal version of the \n\nLegislation \n\nMinistry, as a \n\nresult of the \n\ncollaboration \n\nthat was already \n\ntaking place, \n\nwas open \n\nenough to \n\naccept with \n\ninterest the \n\nparticipation of \n\nCivil Society. \n\nGiven the \n\nexplosion of \n\ninterest in the \n\nexploitation of \n\nnatural \n\nresources in \n\nMozambique, \n\nthe government \n\nfelt the need to \n\nstrengthen its \n\nlegal framework \n\nin the extractive \n\nsector \n\nmoments of tension as \n\nCivil Society has been \n\npushing the \n\nGovernment for \n\ngreater transparency \n\nwith regard to the \n\ncontent of the \n\ncontracts, namely the \n\nprovision of \n\ninformation on who is \n\nthe partner of the \n\nexploring companies \n\nand what are the fees \n\ncharged either for \n\ncontracts / licenses and \n\non corporate revenues \n\nand the Government's \n\nreaction is not always \n\npositive with regard to \n\nthe publication of this \n\ntype of information. \n\nBut it was not a very \n\ntense process \n\ncontribution to the \n\ncontributions that have \n\nbeen made in this \n\nprocess."}]}}}
