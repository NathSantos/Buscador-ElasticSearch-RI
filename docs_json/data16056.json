(needlebush or silky hakea) is an Australian Proteaceae \n\nthat can be found naturalized in South Africa, New Zealand and southern \n\nEurope. It presents xeromorphic adaptations in leaves, produces high amounts \n\nof long-lived, fire resistant seeds that are easily dispersed by both air and water, \n\nand relys on proteoid roots for enhanced nutrient uptake. Such unique abilities \n\nallowed H. sericea to proliferate and spread throughout its new habitats, being \n\ncurrently considered by regulatory agencies as one of the most agressive \n\ninvaders established in Portuguese territory. Although mechanical and \n\nbiological control have already been extensively tested in South Africa to \n\nconstrain the expansion of H. sericea, in Portugal no large scale attempts have \n\nbeen made to control its spreading.  \n\nHere we report the identification of a naturally occuring pathogenic fungus able \n\nto infect H. sericea that could, in a nearby future, be used as part of an \n\nintegrated control strategy for this invader. The pathogenic agent was isolated \n\nfrom leaf spots of infected wild-growing H. sericea found in \u201cSerra de Arga\u201d, in \n\nnorth-western Portugal. Microscopical observation revealed typical \n\nPestalotiopsis sp. 5-celled spores, whose members have been described as \n\npathogenic for Proteaceae species. Thermocyclic amplification of the internal \n\ntranscribed spacer region of the fungal rDNA, using ITS4 and ITS5 universal \n\nprimers, identified the pathogenic agent as Pestalotiopsis funerea. \n\nPathogenicity of P. funerea on H. sericea was confirmed with the infection of \n\nleaf-wounded and non-wounded 6-week-old in vitro-grown plants. Only the leaf-\n\nwounded plants sprayed with P. funerea developed lesions identical to those \n\nobserved in wild-grown specimens.  \n\nA major feature of H. sericea is the ability to produce proteoid roots in response \n\nto mineral scarcity, mainly N and P. Although the enhanced capacity of proteoid \n\nroots to absorb inorganic phosphate (Pi) has been mainly attributed to an \n\nincreased root surface area and higher exudation of organic acids and \n\nphosphatases, here we focused on the Pi uptake system of proteoid roots by \n\nitself. Uptake experiments with 32Pi suggested the involvement of H+/Pi co-\n\n\n\n~ x ~ \n\ntransport systems with Km values of 0.225 and 40.8 \u00b5M Pi, both prone to \n\ncompetitive inhibition with the analogs phosphite and arsenate, but not \n\nvanadate. This biphasic Pi uptake system with the highest affinity at \n\nsubmicromolar range is likely to confer H. sericea the ability to invade and \n\nproliferate throughout vast areas of nutrient-poor soils, where survival for most \n\nplant species seems harder. \n\nIn plants, Pi uptake, translocation through tissues and interorganellar allocation \n\nis carried out by members of the phosphate transporter (PhT) family. Here we \n\nreport the identification of four PhT genes (PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7) from H. \n\nsericea genome. Through phylogenetic analysis and transmembrane domain \n\n(TMD) prediction, all identified genes were placed in the PhT1 family, meaning \n\nPiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 are probably high- or low-affinity H+/Pi symporters \n\ninvolved in Pi transport into the cell. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the \n\nhomology between PhT1 members from different plant species, while PhT2 \n\nmembers (chloroplastidial H+/Pi symporters) were placed in a cluster of their \n\nown. Based on phylogeny, we also report the possible existence of new Na+/Pi \n\nsymporter family in plants. The correlation between the expression site of each \n\nPhT1 with its deduced amino acid sequence has also been studied. \n\nPhylogenetic studies suggest that the amino acid structure of each PhT1 is \n\ninsufficient to predict the tissue where the protein is likely to be expressed. \n\nExpression studies of PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 in plants grown in high- and \n\nlow-Pi availabity shall provide insights on the Pi transport regulation mechanism \n\nof H. sericea. \n\n\n\n~ xi ~ \n\nResumo \n\nHakea sericea Schrad. (h\u00e1quea-espinheiro ou h\u00e1quea-picante) \u00e9 uma \n\nProteaceae nativa da Austr\u00e1lia que se encontra actualmente naturalizada na \n\n\u00c1frica do Sul, Nova Zel\u00e2ndia e partes do sul da Europa. Apresenta folhas com \n\nmodifica\u00e7\u00f5es xerof\u00edticas e produz anualmente uma grande quantidade de \n\nfol\u00edculos contendo sementes aladas. Estas sementes s\u00e3o libertadas apenas \n\nap\u00f3s a passagem de fogo ou morte da planta, sendo dispersas quer pelo ar, \n\nquer por cursos de \u00e1gua. Associada ao crescimento da H. sericea em solos \n\npobres em minerais est\u00e1 a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de ra\u00edzes prote\u00f3ides especializadas na \n\ncapta\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfato. Estas caracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas permitiram a fixa\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nprolifera\u00e7\u00e3o de H. sericea em novos habitats, sendo actualmente considerada \n\npelo Minist\u00e9rio do Ambiente como uma das invasoras mais agressivas em \n\nPortugal. Embora na \u00c1frica do Sul tivessem sido testadas formas de controlo \n\nmec\u00e2nico e biol\u00f3gico desta esp\u00e9cie, em Portugal n\u00e3o se efectuou ainda \n\nqualquer tentativa em grande escala de controlar a invas\u00e3o. \n\nAqui reportamos a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de um fungo patog\u00e9nico capaz de infectar H. \n\nsericea que poder\u00e1, num futuro pr\u00f3ximo, ser usado como parte integrante de \n\num programa de controlo desta esp\u00e9cie. O agente patog\u00e9nico foi isolado a \n\npartir de les\u00f5es nas folhas de esp\u00e9cimes infectados a crescer nas encostas da \n\nSerra de Arga, no noroeste portugu\u00eas. Por observa\u00e7\u00e3o microsc\u00f3pica foram \n\nidentificados esporos com cinco c\u00e9lulas t\u00edpicos do g\u00e9nero Pestalotiopsis sp. A \n\namplifica\u00e7\u00e3o termoc\u00edclica das regi\u00f5es ITS do rDNA do fungo, usando os \n\niniciadores oligonucleot\u00eddicos universais ITS4 e ITS5 permitiu a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nagente patog\u00e9nico como sendo Pestalotiopsis funerea. A patogenicidade de P. \n\nfunerea em H. sericea foi confirmada atrav\u00e9s da infec\u00e7\u00e3o de pl\u00e2ntulas \n\ncrescidas in vitro com ou sem pequenas incis\u00f5es nas folhas. Apenas plantas \n\nlesadas e infectadas com P. funerea desenvolveram sintomas id\u00eanticos aos \n\nobservados em plantas contaminadas presentes na Serra de Arga. \n\nUm dos principais atributos de H. sericea \u00e9 a capacidade de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nra\u00edzes prote\u00f3ides em resposta \u00e0 escassez de minerais, nomeadamente azoto e \n\nf\u00f3sforo. Apesar da alta efic\u00e1cia que estas ra\u00edzes t\u00eam em captar fosfato ter sido \n\n\n\n~ xii ~ \n\nassociada sobretudo ao aumento da \u00e1rea de superf\u00edcie da raiz e da grande \n\ncapacidade de exsuda\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cidos org\u00e2nicos e fosfatases, neste trabalho \n\nfocamo-nos no pr\u00f3prio mecanismo de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfato. Experi\u00eancias de \n\ncapta\u00e7\u00e3o de 32Pi sugeriram o envolvimento de um sistema de co-transporte de \n\nfosfato com prot\u00f5es com valores de Km de 0.225 e 40.8 \u00b5M Pi, ambos \n\nsuscept\u00edveis a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o competitiva pelos an\u00e1logos fosfito e arsenato, mas n\u00e3o \n\npor vanadato. Este sistema bif\u00e1sico de capta\u00e7\u00e3o de Pi com um sistema com \n\numa afinidade invulgarmente alta em plantas deve provavelmente permitir que \n\nH. sericea seja capaz de invadir e proliferar em \u00e1reas pobres em nutrientes, \n\nonde a sobreviv\u00eancia de outras esp\u00e9cies aparenta ser dificultada. \n\nNas plantas, a capta\u00e7\u00e3o e transloca\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfato atrav\u00e9s de tecidos e \n\norganelos est\u00e1 dependente de membros da fam\u00edlia dos transportadores de \n\nfosfato (PhT). Neste trabalho reportamos a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de quatro genes PhT \n\n(PiT2, PiT6, PH5 e PH7) no genoma de H. sericea. Atrav\u00e9s de an\u00e1lise \n\nfilogen\u00e9tica e predi\u00e7\u00e3o de dom\u00ednios transmembranares (TMD), todos os genes \n\nidentificados foram caracterizados como membros da sub-fam\u00edlia PhT1. Assim, \n\nPiT2, PiT6, PH5 e PH7 s\u00e3o provavelmente simportadores de Pi com prot\u00f5es de \n\nalta ou baixa afinidade envolvidos na capta\u00e7\u00e3o de fosfato ao n\u00edvel da \n\nmembrana celular. A an\u00e1lise filogen\u00e9tica tamb\u00e9m confirmou a homologia entre \n\ntodos os membros PhT1 analisados. Da mesma forma, todos os membros \n\nPhT2, simportadores cloroplastidiais de Pi com prot\u00f5es, formaram o seu pr\u00f3prio \n\nagrupamento filogen\u00e9tico. Reportamos tamb\u00e9m com base na filogenia, a \n\nposs\u00edvel exist\u00eancia de uma nova fam\u00edlia de simportadores de fosfato com s\u00f3dio \n\nem plantas. O estudo da rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre o local de express\u00e3o de cada PhT1  com \n\na sua estrutura aminoac\u00eddica deduzida sugere que esta \u00e9 insuficiente para \n\ndeterminar o tecido onde a prote\u00edna dever\u00e1 ser expressa. Assim, para que \n\npossamos conhecer mais profundamente os mecanismos de regula\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ntransporte de Pi em H. sericea ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1rio realizar estudos de express\u00e3o \n\nde PiT2, PiT6, PH5 e PH7 em plantas crescidas em altas ou baixas \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de fosfato. \n\n\n\n~ xiii ~ \n\nContents \n \n\nChapter 1 -

The 80 genera and 1769 species recognized in the family are \n\ndistributed mainly in the Southern hemisphere and are almost completely \n\nrestricted to Gondwanic continental blocks and fragments (Weston, 2006). The \n\nfamily is most diverse in Australia, followed by southern Africa, South America, \n\nNew Caledonia, New Guinea, Malesia, south and east Asia, tropical Africa, \n\nCentral America, Madagascar, New Zealand, Fiji, southern India, Sri Lanka, \n\nVanuatu and Micronesia (Johnson and Briggs, 1975; Weston and Crisp, 1996; \n\nGeorge, 1998) (Fig 1.2). Proteaceae species inhabit a wide variety of habitats, \n\nranging from wet tropical, warm subtropical temperate and cool temperate \n\nrainforests, to semi-arid, arid and saline coastal areas of sandstone soils, to \n\nMediterranean climates and alpine areas (Specht et al., 1974; Cowling and \n\nLamont, 1998). Furthermore, many Proteaceae are suited with morphological \n\nand physiological adaptations that enable them to survive in harsh conditions, \n\nsuch as nutrient deprivation, fire exposure or excess/shortage of light. \n\nProteaceae family presents diverse leaf morphology and anatomy (Johnson and \n\nBriggs, 1975; Carpenter, 1994; Catling and Gates, 1998). With the exception of \n\nthe mesophytic rainforest species, most Proteaceae are sclerophyllous (from \n\nGreek skleros - hard and phullon - leaf), presenting mature leaves with high \n\namounts of lignin in the sclerenchyma, cutin in thick cuticles, and/or epidermal \n\ncell walls rich in silica (Beadle, 1966; Dillon, 2002; Jordan et al., 2005). The \n\nevolution of scleromorphy still remains controversial and it has been considered \n\nto be an adaptation to seasonal water deficits, especially common in temperate, \n\ndry summer climates (Edwards at al., 2000). \n\n\n\n1.1 INTRODUCING HAKEA SERICEA AND THE PROTEACEAE FAMILY \n\n~ 4 ~ \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 Proteaceae diversity.  \n\n(A) Alloxylon flammeum is one of the most spectacular Australian native plants.

(B) Grevillea banksii is widely cultivated in its \nshrubby form, although it can be found in the \u201ctree form\u201d in the wild. (C) Leucospermum erubescens is \nnative to Zimbabwe and South Africa, occupying a variety of habitats, including scrub, forest, and \nmountain slopes. (D) Hakea laurina is found mostly in sandplains or sandy-clay of south-western Australia \nand is frost tolerant. (E) Protea cynaroides, also known as King Protea, is the National Flower of South \nAfrica, and it grows in the southern part of the country. Their unusual flowers are becoming very popular \nfor flower arrangements due to their long vase life, making also excellent dried flowers. (F) Stenocarpus \nsinuatus occurs in rainforests of north-eastern Australia and Papua New Guinea. It prefers fairly rich, \nloamy soils but is tolerant of most well drained soils. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 5 ~ \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 Native distribution of Proteaceae (adapted from Weston, 2006). \n\n \nAlthough scleromorphy was suggested to increase drought tolerance by \n\nincreasing the ability of leaves to tolerate low water potentials, this is poorly \n\nsupported by experimental evidence (Salleo and Nardini, 2000). In fact, cuticle \n\nthickness is poorly related to resistance to diffusion of water vapour (Kerstiens, \n\n1996; Riederer and Schreiber, 2001). Alternatively, low nutrient availability \n\nappears to have been more important than aridity in the evolution of \n\nscleromorphy in many Southern hemisphere groups (Hill, 1998). Indeed, \n\ndiverse scleromorphic proteaceous fossil leaves occurred in the Paleogene, \n\nlong before the drying of Australia (Carpenter et al., 1994; Carpenter and \n\nJordan, 1997; Jordan et al., 1998). The evolution of scleromorphy in response \n\nto low nutrient environments can be explained by two different models. Loveless \n\n(1962) proposed that phosphate limitation may originate photosynthates that \n\ncannot be used metabolically, and thus, would be accumulated as nonfunctional \n\nsclerenchyma or cuticle. This model would predict nonspecific distribution of \n\nsclerenchyma in leaves, perhaps concentrated near the site of production, the \n\nmesophyll. A more recent model proposes that scleromorphy may protect long-\n\nlived leaves in low productivity environments from different types of damage \n\nand stress (Turner, 1994). This model could explain scleromorphy not only in \n\nlow nutrient environments, but also in dry and cold ones. \n\n\n\n1.1 INTRODUCING HAKEA SERICEA AND THE PROTEACEAE FAMILY \n\n~ 6 ~ \n\nThe range of specialized scleromorphic leaf anatomical structures in \n\nProteaceae is remarkably wide and includes structures associated with the \n\nvascular bundles, leaf margins, and mesophyll (Dillon, 2002). Some are also \n\nassociated with the leaf surface exposed to radiation and include cuticles up to \n\n35 mm thick and five anatomically distinct kinds of lignified layers between the \n\nepidermis and the mesophyll. Thereby, the solar radiation that reaches the \n\nmesophyll is attenuated as the amount of tissue and number of surfaces that \n\nradiation must pass through is largely increased (Jordan et al., 2005). Other \n\nscleromorphic structures such as osteosclereids, thick mesophyll cell walls and \n\nbundle sheath extensions prevent leaf collapse (Dillon, 2002) and should also \n\nincrease resistance to piercing and shearing, such as those caused by many \n\nherbivores (Read et al., 2000). In addition, scleromorphic structures increase \n\nleaf carbon to nitrogen ratios, which may reduce herbivory (Coley et al., 1985; \n\nColey, 1988). Besides scleromorphy as an adaptation to poor-nutrient soils, all \n\nProteaceae, except the Persoonioideae and Symphionematoideae, rely on the \n\nformation of proteoid roots for the uptake of inorganic nutrients (Purnell, 1960; \n\nJeffrey, 1967; Lamont, 1972; Malajczuk and Bowen, 1974; Pate, 1994; Jeschke \n\nand Pate, 1995 and Pate et al., 1998).  \n\nSeeds of most Proteaceae species do not store starch. Instead, they tend to be \n\nprovisioned with resources that establishing seedlings will find scarce in their \n\nhabitat. Usually, seeds from species endemic to rainforests tend to be larger \n\nand have a very high ratio of lipid/protein (Grundon, 1972; Kuo et al., 1982). \n\nThese energy reserves seem to have high survival value to seedlings under \n\nrainforest canopies, where light may be in short supply (Pate et al., 1986). \n\nConversely, Proteaceae occurring in infertile soils typically have smaller seeds \n\nwith very high amounts of phosphorus, mostly in the form of phytate, which \n\nfunctions as foci for the accumulation of a range of cationic reserves, including \n\ncalcium, magnesium, potassium and a number of micronutrients (Pate  \n\net al., 1986; Stock et al., 1989; Lamont and Groom, 1998). \n\nSurvival of seedlings can be enhanced if germination occurs during the periods \n\nwhen the resources for establishment and growth are high and the abundance \n\nof potential predators and pathogenic organisms are low (Myerscough  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 7 ~ \n\net al., 2001). Many Proteaceae species endemic to fire-prone and infertile \n\nhabitats may control the timing of germination in three different ways. Mature, \n\nnon-dormant seeds may be retained on parental plants in fairly tough and \n\nwoody fruits that open and disperse the seeds usually following a fire or plant \n\nexposure to extremely hot weather, such as in Hakea sericea and Banksia \n\nserrata (Whelan et al., 1998; Brown and Whelan, 1999). Seeds in a dormant \n\nstate may be shed onto the soil, with their dormancy being subsequently broken \n\nby the passage of a fire (dormant soil seed bank), as in Grevillea rivularis \n\n(Pickup et al., 2003). Finally, after surviving a fire, Proteaceae species such as \n\nLomatia silaifolia and Telopea speciosissima are stimulated to flower and \n\nproduce non-dormant seeds that are shed on maturity (Pyke, 1983; Bradstock, \n\n1995; Denham and Auld, 1999; Denham and Whelan, 2000). Although this \n\nmode of germination seems to be the rarest, it is widespread along many \n\nspecies of monocotyledons (Keith, 1996). \n\nDormancy of seeds is common among many Proteaceae growing in fire-prone \n\nhabitats. For example, the released mature fruits of Persoonia maintain seeds \n\nin a dormant state, which is hard to break artificially (Wrigley and  \n\nFagg, 1989; Ketelhohn et al., 1996). Also, the dormancy of seeds from \n\nConospermum can be broken with the exposure to smoke (Dixon et al., 1995; \n\nRoche et al., 1997). Proteaceae species endemic to regions where wildfires are \n\ncommon are often serotinous, with mature seeds stored in robust fruits, ranging \n\nfrom leathery to massive woody structures (Lamont et al., 1991; Read and \n\nStokes, 2006). Although protection of seeds from heat is related to wall \n\nthickness and fruit size (Bradstock et al., 1994), woody fruits also confer \n\nprotection against insect larvae and seed-eating birds (Groom and Lamont, \n\n1997). Another adaptation developed by some Proteaceae to cope with extreme \n\ntemperatures is the ability to resprout from a lignotuber and/or epicormic shoots \n\nfollowing a fire (Zammit, 2006). \n\nTaking into account these abilities, many Proteaceae members tend to fall into \n\nthe category of stress-tolerators as described by Grime (1974), in which plants \n\nare able to inhabit environments where at least one resource for growth is in low \n\nsupply. \n\n\n\n1.1 INTRODUCING HAKEA SERICEA AND THE PROTEACEAE FAMILY \n\n~ 8 ~ \n\n1.1.2 Hakea sericea Schrad. \n\nHakea Schrader &amp; J.C.Wendl is one of the 80 genera found in the Proteaceae, \n\nnamed after Baron Christian Ludwig von Hake (1745\u20131818), a German patron \n\nof botany. The genus includes 149 species, most native of Western Australia, \n\nwith around 40 species found in the eastern states (Barker et al, 1999). It is \n\naccepted that the genus Grevillea is paraphyletic with respect to Hakea, being \n\nexpected that Hakea will soon be transferred into Grevillea (Briggs, 1998). \n\nHakea sericea (needlebush or silky hakea), formerly known as H. acicularis or \n\nH. tenuifolia, is native of the dry sclerophyll forests and heaths on sandstone \n\nsoils and shales of the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria and \n\nTasmania. It can also be found naturalized elsewhere in Australia, southern \n\nEurope, South Africa and New Zealand (Weber, 2003). \n\nH. sericea grows into erect, branched, evergreen woody shrubs that can reach \n\nup to 5 m high and 3 m across (Fig 1.3.A). It presents xeromorphic adaptations \n\nin the morphology and anatomy of mature leaves (Fig 1.3.B). The acicular rigid \n\nleaves (terete), 2-7 cm long with diameter of 1 mm, are protected by a thick \n\ncuticle, ranging between 12-18 ?m in young leaves and 20-30 ?m in older \n\nleaves (Teixeira et al., 2008). Leaves are amphistomatous and present sunken \n\nstomata below the epidermal surface. Mesophyll is characterized by a dual \n\nlayer palisade with increased thickness (Groom et al., 1997). Osteosclereids, \n\nbone shaped sclereids with columnar middles and small enlargements at both \n\nends are inserted between the mesophyll cells. Their presence is required for \n\nsupport, since turgor pressure cannot be maintained at high levels within the \n\ntissues. The leaf core contains vascular bundles randomly scattered and a  \n\nwell-developed sclenchymatous bundle sheath surrounding each vein. \n\nHermaphrodite white or pink flowers occur in axillary clusters (Fig 1.3.C) from \n\nwinter to early spring \u2013 June to September in the Southern hemisphere - and \n\nfruit development usually begins in October. As in all Hakea species, fruits \n\nconsist of persistent non-fleshy (woody) follicles comprising two dehiscent \n\nvalves, each valve containing one black, compressed, winged seed (Fig 1.3.D). \n\nH. sericea seeds contain considerable amounts of phosphorus, most in the form  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 9 ~ \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 Morphological aspects of Hakea sericea.  \n\n(A) Adult bushes, which can reach up to 5 m high and 3 m across. (B) Transversal cross-section of \nacicular leaves (1 mm diameter) after being coloured to highlight the xeromorphic adaptations: epidermis \nwith thick cuticle (in blue), sunken stomata below the epidermal surface (in red), osteosclereids (in yellow) \nand two layers of palisade mesophyll cells (in green). (C) White flowers occurring in axillary clusters. (D) \nFruits consist of persistent woody follicles exhibiting two dehiscent valves that open when the plant dies. \n(E) Cluster of rootlets of a young proteoid root. \n\n \n\n\n\n1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION \n\n~ 10 ~ \n\nof potassium, sodium, calcium salts and ferric phytate (Mitchell and Allsopp, \n\n1984). Ranging from 2-3 cm in length (from the point of the seed to the end of \n\nthe wing), seeds are produced annually, stored in the canopy and only released \n\nafter fire or when the plant dies (Bradstock, 1991). While most seeds fall near \n\nthe parent forming dense stands, some are dispersed primarily by wind and \n\nalso by surface water flow (Whelan, 1986). They germinate rapidly following \n\nrelease and new viable seeds are produced after 2 years (Dyer and \n\nRichardson, 1992). Besides seeds, H. sericea may also regenerate from \n\nrootstocks after fire exposure. \n\nH. sericea, as most Proteaceae, is able to develop proteoid roots in response to \n\nmineral scarcity (Fig 1.3.E). This adaptive advantage grants H. sericea the \n\nability to propagate in poor-nutrient soils, where survival for most plant species \n\nseems difficult. Due to its great importance in the establishment of H. sericea \n\nstands outside its natural range, this feature will be dealt in more detail in \n\nsubsequent sections. \n\n1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION \n\n1.2.1 Phosphorus importance and availability \n\nPhosphorus (P) is one of the 17 essential elements required for plant growth \n\n(Bieleski, 1973; reviewed by Raghothama, 1999), making up 0.05 to 0.50% of \n\nthe plant dry weight (Schachtman et al, 1998; Vance et al., 2003). This element \n\nis a component of many key molecules such as nucleic acids, phospholipids, \n\nand ATP. It also plays an important role in an array of major biochemical \n\nprocesses that includes energy generation, photosynthesis, glycolysis, \n\nrespiration, membrane synthesis, enzyme activation/inactivation, redox \n\nreactions and nitrogen or sulphur assimilation (Theodorou and Plaxton, 1993; \n\nreviewed by Vance et al., 2003). Moreover, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation \n\nof proteins is crucial for signal-transduction pathways in plants, and phosphate \n\nhomeostasis in chloroplasts regulates the transport of phosphorylated sugars \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 11 ~ \n\nacross the membrane and the synthesis of starch (Raghothama and \n\nKarthikeyan, 2005). \n\nAlthough phosphorus is abundant in the lithosphere, its physicochemical \n\nproperties and soil chemistry make it, after N, the most frequent limiting \n\nmacronutrient for plant growth (Schachtman et al, 1998; Ticconi and Abel, \n\n2004). In fact, soil concentrations of soluble P are often up to a 1000-fold lower \n\nthan those of other required ions (Vance et al., 2003). The level of available P in \n\nsoil solution is mainly regulated by its interaction with organic or inorganic \n\nsurfaces in the soil. Organic P (Po) represents 20 to 80% of total P in the soil, of \n\nwhich phytic acid is usually a major component (Richardson, 1994). The \n\nremainder P in soil is found in the inorganic fraction, which contains about 170 \n\nmineral forms of P (Holford, 1997). A large portion of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is \n\nhowever unavailable to plants. Insoluble complexes with cations, such as \n\naluminum and iron predominate in acidic soils, while calcium complexes are \n\nusually found in alkaline soil types. Regarding Po, it has to be mineralized to the \n\ninorganic form before it becomes available to plants. Many soil microorganisms \n\nrelease these immobile forms of P to the soil solution, but at the same time they \n\ncompete with plants to obtain the newly available P (Raghothama, 1999). \n\nThe form of P most readily accessed by plants is phosphate. If in fertile soils \n\nphosphate availability can reach up to 10 \u00b5M, in many soils Pi seldom exceeds \n\n1 \u00b5M (Bieleski, 1973; Schachtman et al., 1998). Phosphorus is mainly moved by \n\ndiffusion contrarily to other soluble minerals such as K, which also moves \n\nthrough the soil via bulk flow into the sites where uptake by root cells occurs. \n\nThe relative slow rate of Pi diffusion (10-12 to 10-15 m2 s-1) turns the rhizosphere \n\ndepleted of Pi. In order to survive, plants developed strategies for improving \n\nphosphate uptake (1) aiming the reduction of Pi depletion zone, while at the \n\nsame time (2) increasing the concentration of soluble phosphate at the sites of \n\nphosphate uptake in roots (Smith, 2002). \n\n1.2.2 Proteoid root geometry and morphology \n\nThe low availability of Pi in many soils forced plants to evolve mechanisms to \n\nscavenge for this nutrient. Plant root geometry and morphology directly affect \n\n\n\n1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION \n\n~ 12 ~ \n\nthe efficiency of Pi uptake, since root systems with higher ratios of surface area \n\ncan explore a larger volume of soil (Lynch, 1995). Following this principle, some \n\nspecies have developed proteoid roots, a type of root system specialized in \n\nnutrient acquisition, particularly phosphorus.  \n\nProteoid roots were first observed on Banksia spp. growing in the botanical \n\ngardens in Leipzig, Germany, and were described as roots very much branched \n\n(Engler, 1894). Nowadays, it is known that proteoid roots are almost ubiquitous \n\namongst Proteaceae [from which the term proteoid comes from (Purnell, 1960)], \n\nand can also be found in some members of Betulaceae (Hurd and Schwintzer, \n\n1996), Casuarinaceae (Za\u00efd et al., 2003), Curcurbitaceae (Waters and Blevins, \n\n2000), Eleagnaceae (Skene, 1998), Fabaceae (Gardner et al., 1982), Moraceae \n\n(Rosenfield et al., 1991) and Myricaceae (Hurd and Schwintzer, 1997). Proteoid \n\nroots, also known as cluster roots, can be defined as roots that develop one or \n\nmore discrete clusters of closely spaced rootlets along its length (Watt and \n\nEvans, 1999). The rootlets are covered with root hairs and arise in contiguous \n\nrows, opposite to every protoxylem pole. Consequently, species with more \n\nprotoxylem poles present a greater rootlet density (Lambers et al., 2003). In \n\nLupinus albus (Fabaceae) cluster roots usually display 1 to 4 rootlets mm-1 root \n\naxis (Johnson et al., 1994), while in Hakea prostrate they are composed by 100 \n\nrootlets mm-1 root axis (Lamont, 1972). Proteoid roots can be divided in two \n\ntypes: simple, as in Hakea and Lupinus and compound as in Banksia and \n\nDryandra species (Shane and Lambers, 2005). While simple cluster roots \n\ndisplay bottlebrush-like morphology, compound cluster roots are an assemblage \n\nof many simple cluster roots, exhibiting a Christmas-tree-like morphology. \n\nThe proliferation of root clusters greatly increases the root surface area in \n\ncontact with the soil, thus enhancing nutrient uptake. In Hakea obliqua, the \n\nsurface area of a mature proteoid root cluster is increased 25-fold taking into \n\naccount the equivalent mass of axial root (Dell et al., 1980). In Leucadendron \n\nlaureolum the soil volume explored within the boundaries of these rootlets is \n\n288-fold higher than the equivalent length of non-proteoid root (Lamont, 1983). \n\nDuring growing season, root clusters constantly explore new soil regions \n\n(Lamont, 2003), thus minimising the path length for Pi and NH4, nutrients whose \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 13 ~ \n\nuptake is only dependent on diffusion (Voorster and Jooste, 1986). It also \n\nmaximises the soil-root water potential gradient pathways for nutrients such as \n\nCa, Mg, S and NO3, whose uptake is largely controlled by bulk flow (Gould, \n\n1998). \n\n1.2.3 Proteoid root exudates \n\nCoupled with increased ratios of surface area to volume, proteoid roots are also \n\nable to chemically modify the surrounding soil (Neumann and Martinoia, 2002). \n\nAccording to Grierson and Attiwill (1989), the proteoid root mat of Banksia \n\nintegrifolia enhances the uptake of nutrients by promoting the chemical \n\nmodification of soil environment. By exuding carboxylate organic anions, acid \n\nphosphatases, phenolics, mucilages and water, many soil nutrients that were \n\npreviously inaccessible to the plant become available for uptake (Fig 1.4) \n\n(Lambers et al., 2006). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 Model for root-induced inorganic phosphate (Pi) and organic phosphate (Po) \nmobilization in the rhizosphere by exudation of carboxylates, protons and acid \nphosphatases.  \n\nCarboxylates may be released via anion channel, but the mechanism used for phosphatases release is \nunknown. Carboxylates mobilize both Pi and Po, while phosphatases hydrolyze Po compounds into Pi. \nProtons are released in the rhizosphere through H+-ATPase pumps, at the expense of ATP. Available Pi is \ntransported from the rhizosphere to the cytoplasm through Pi transporters in symport with protons \n(adapted from Lambers et al., 2006). \n\n\n\n1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION \n\n~ 14 ~ \n\nMany plant species export organic anions into the soil in response to P \n\nprivation, since organic anions can mobilize P by chelating soil minerals that are \n\nbound to this nutrient (Shane and Lambers, 2005). The carboxylates export \n\nrates from roots of proteoid species are usually several times higher than those \n\ndescribed for non-proteoid species (Jones, 1998). In fact, proteoid species are \n\nable to export amounts of carbon that range from 11% (Gardner et al., 1983) to \n\ngreater than 23% (Dinkelaker et al., 1989) of the total plant dry weight. The \n\norganic anions pattern in root exudates varies among species. The release of \n\ncitrate, as well as small amounts of malate and succinate, by proteoid roots of \n\nLupinus albus mobilizes precipitates of Pi, both in acidic (Gardner et al., 1982) \n\nand calcareous soils (Dinkelaker et al., 1989). Conversely, exudates of Hakea \n\nundulata are mostly composed of malate and fumarate, while citrate is poorly \n\nrepresented (Dinkelaker et al., 1997). Interestingly, plants seem to perceive the \n\nchemistry of the soil where they grow. For example, the production of proteoid \n\nroots in seedlings of both Telopea speciosissima and Banksia ericifolia was \n\nfound to be directly dependent on the level of phosphate supplied (Grose, 1989; \n\nHandreck, 1991). Also, the pattern of carboxylate exudation in Banksia grandis \n\nis affected by the form of phosphate added to the soil (Lambers et al., 2002). \n\nTri- and dicarboxylates (citrate, 60%; malate, 25%; trans-aconitate, 14%) are \n\nthe major organic anions in root exudates when P is supplied as Al-phosphate. \n\nIn contrast, when P is supplied as Fe-phosphate, besides the same tri- and \n\ndicarboxylates (31, 14 and 12%, respectively), plants also release \n\nmonocarboxylates (lactate, 30%; acetate, 12%).  \n\nBefore becoming available to plants, soil Po must be first hydrolyzed to Pi \n\n(George et al., 2002). Acid phosphatases can hydrolyse a wide range of Po \n\ncompounds (Tarafdar and Claassen, 2001), including phosphate mono- and  \n\ndi-esters, both common Po forms in soils (Sumann et al., 1998). The release of \n\nacid phosphatases to the rhizosphere in response to P low availability is a \n\nuniversal response by plants (Duff et al., 1994). In accordance, proteoid-forming \n\nspecies such as Lupinus albus (Gilbert et al., 1999; Wasaki et al., 2003) and \n\nHakea undulata (Dinkelaker et al., 1997) can exude large amounts of acid \n\nphosphatases to the rhizosphere in response to P scarcity, during several hours \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 15 ~ \n\nor even days (Miller et al., 2001). In Lupinus albus, a novel acid phosphatase is \n\nspecifically induced as a response to low internal P concentration (Gilbert  \n\net al., 1999; Miller et al., 2001). \n\nThe efflux of large amounts of carboxylates is linked to a modified organic anion \n\nmetabolism, in which both enhancement and reduction of the specific activity of \n\nseveral key enzymes occur (Neumann and Martinoia, 2002). The carbon \n\nrequired for exudation is derived from both photosynthetic (65%) and dark CO2 \n\n(35%) fixation (Johnson et al., 1994). Dark CO2 fixation occurring in roots is \n\nmediated by several enzymes including carbamoyl phosphate synthase  \n\n(EC 6.3.4.16) (McClure et al., 1983) and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole  \n\n(EC 4.1.1.21) (Boland and Schubert, 1982). The anaplerotic pathway seems to \n\ncontribute mostly to this phenomenon, in which phosphoenolpyruvate \n\ncarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31; PEPC) catalyzes the carboxylation of \n\nphosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form oxaloacetate (Vance et al., 1983; Johnson \n\net al., 1994). Studies in Lupinus albus (Uhde-Stone et al., 2003), Brassica \n\nnapus (Moraes and Plaxton, 2000) and Sesbania rostrata (Aono et al., 2001) \n\nhave shown that enhanced CO2 fixation in roots is coupled with an increased \n\nspecific activity of PEPC, as well as malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37; \n\nMDH), and citrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.1; CS), which are responsible for the \n\nsynthesis of carboxylate intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)  \n\n(Fig 1.5). Moreover, reduced degradation or utilization of citrate is also involved \n\nin carboxylates exudation. In cluster roots of Lupinus albus the activity of \n\naconitase (EC 4.2.1.3; Aco), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of citrate \n\nto isocitrate, is reduced (Neumann et al., 1999; Kihara et al., 2003), thus \n\nresulting in more citrate available for exudation (Fig 1.5). The reduced activity of \n\nAco also leads to lower respiration rates, which are an indirect measure of flux \n\nthrough the TCA cycle (Johnson et al., 1994; Neumann et al., 1999). Despite \n\nthe large quantities of organic acids produced and exuded by proteoid roots, the \n\nmechanism by which exudation actually occurs is not yet fully understood. \n\nEfflux of carboxylates may be mediated by anion channels such as chloride \n\nchannels and MATE (Multidrug And Toxin Extrusion) (Johnson et al., 1996; \n\n\n\n1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION \n\n~ 16 ~ \n\nVance et al., 2003). Alternatively, carboxylates could be packaged in vesicles \n\nand released into the rhizosphere by exocytosis (Watt and Evans, 1999). \n\nThe export of organic acid anions coincides with a marked acidification of the \n\nrhizosphere due to the release of protons via plasma membrane ATPase  \n\n(Fig 1.4) (Dinkelaker et al., 1995; Neumann and Martinoia, 2002). This \n\nphenomenon is mainly attributed to the fact that Pi can only be acquired by \n\nroots through an energy-mediated co-transport process driven by protons \n\n(Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1984; Sakano et al., 1992). However, the extrusion of \n\nprotons along with carboxylates into the rhizosphere may also be triggered to \n\nprevent the inhibiting effect of cytosolic acidification (Sakano, 2001). Plant \n\nglycolysis only occurs when the cytoplasm is sufficiently alkaline to stimulate \n\nPEPC activity. Since the synthesis of organic anions generates an excess of \n\nprotons, their extrusion would prevent glycolysis inhibition, ultimately resulting in \n\nthe production of more organic anions. The resulting acidification of the \n\nrhizosphere may also enhance the hydrolysis of organic phosphate by acid \n\nphosphatases (Braum and Helmke, 1995). \n\nOther soil chemical modifications promoted by proteoid roots include the \n\nproduction of anionic mucopolysaccharides and phenolics by root cap cells that \n\nact in the same way as carboxylates, although to a much lesser extent (Dell  \n\net al., 1980; Neumann and R\u00f6mheld, 2001; Guppy et al., 2005). Exudation of \n\nthese compounds is also enhanced under P deficiency (Grimal et al., 2001; \n\nNeumann and R\u00f6mheld, 2001; Juszczuk et al., 2004), contributing for the \n\nenhanced Pi availability in soil. Furthermore, the distance that nutrients must \n\ndiffuse to reach the root surface is reduced by mucilage, since it contributes to \n\nthe binding of soil particles, thus improving the soil root contact area (Watt  \n\net al., 1994). Although phenolics can also contribute to P mobilization, their \n\necophysiological role seems to be the prevention of microbial breakdown of \n\nexuded carboxylates, since phenolics slow down fungal metabolism by \n\nstimulating sporulation (Neumann and R\u00f6mheld, 2001; Weisskopf et al., 2006). \n\nExamples of phenolics that are exuded into the rhizosphere are piscidic acid \n\nfrom roots of Cajanus cajan (Ae et al., 1990), alfafuran from Medicago sativa \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 17 ~ \n\nroots (Masaoka et al., 1993), and isoflavonoids from cluster roots of white lupin \n\n(Neumann et al., 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 Model for modified anion metabolism leading to the carboxylates efflux in \ncluster roots of Lupinus albus.  \n\nThe stimulated metabolic reactions and sequences are depicted in green and those inhibited are depicted \nin red. Organic acid extrusion requires additional carbon. CO2 fixation is achieved by the increase of PEPC \nactivity. The enhancement of MDH and CS activities coupled with a decrease on Aco and ACL activities \nlead to an accumulation of citrate. Citrate is exported along with protons to the rhizosphere, enhancing Pi \navailability. Abbreviations: ACL, ATP-citrate lyase; Aco, aconitase; CS, citrate synthase; HK, hexokinase; \nMDH, malate dehydrogenase; PEP, phosphoenol pyruvate; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; \nPGM, phosphoglucomutase; SuSy, sucrose synthase (adapted from Neumann and Martinoia, 2002). \n\nMany plant species release a wide range of compounds as a response to \n\nnutrient scarcity, but only proteoid-forming species seem to achieve it through \n\nexudate bursts (Lambers et al., 2006). Young cluster roots only release small \n\namounts or even no material into the rhizosphere. However, when rootlets \n\nreach maturity they export large quantities of carboxylates for a short period of \n\n2-3 days, followed by an almost absence of exudation. After uptaking the newly \n\navailable Pi, proteoid rootlets become unnecessary and become senescent \n\n(Dinkelaker et al., 1995). This process is continuously repeated and can be \n\n\n\n1.2 THE ROLE OF PROTEOID ROOTS IN PHOSPHORUS NUTRITION \n\n~ 18 ~ \n\nexplained by two main reasons: (1) since P has a low diffusion coefficient, a \n\nrapid and concentrated burst in newly explored soil areas would benefit more \n\nthe plant than a long-term, continuous but lower level of exudation, and (2) it \n\nmay prevent soil bacteria from completely metabolizing the exudates before \n\nthey enhanced P uptake (Skene, 1998). \n\nWhen a plant has some roots in contact with moist soils and others with dry soil, \n\nwater may flow from moist to dry patches (Lambers et al., 2006). Plants can \n\ndeliberately release water into superficial dry soil horizons to enhance the \n\nmobility of Pi mobilized by other exudates, in a process named hydraulic \n\nredistribution (Burgess et al., 1998, 2000). Furthermore, the hydration of the \n\nproteoid rhizosphere also seems to increase the longevity of rootlets in a dry \n\nenvironment (Pate and Dawson, 1999). \n\n1.2.4 Association between proteoid roots and microorganisms \n\nMore than 90% of land plants form symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal \n\nfungi. While plants provide organic C compounds to the fungi, the mycelium is \n\nresponsible for increasing the soil volume explored by the roots, playing an \n\nimportant role in plant mineral nutrition (Bolan, 1991; Smith and Read, 1997). \n\nWithin the same plant species, uptake of P in roots colonized by mycorrhizal \n\nfungi can be several times higher than in nonmycorrhizal roots (Smith and \n\nRead, 1997). Both mycorrhizas and cluster roots seem to have similar \n\nfunctions, increasing the area for absorption of water and inorganic nutrients \n\nfrom the soil (Malajczuk and Bowen, 1974; Lamont, 1982, 1984). Although fungi \n\nmay be found in association with roots from Proteaceae species, no symbiotic \n\nmycorrhizas appear to be formed (Reddell et al., 1997). \n\nBacteria may also be found associated with roots from Proteaceae. The \n\npossible enhancement of nutrient uptake resulting from this interaction has \n\nbeen studied by Wenzel et al., (1994). Bacteria isolated from proteoid and  \n\nnon-proteoid roots of Telopea speciosissima enhanced the solubilisation of \n\ncalcium phosphates in culture. However, the ecophysiological importance of this \n\nphenomenon is still unknown, since it was not shown that bacteria render \n\ninsoluble soil phosphates available to plant uptake. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 19 ~ \n\nThe role of microorganisms in cluster root initiation has also been studied. \n\nLamont and McComb (1974) showed that formation of cluster roots in Hakea \n\nprostrata growing in autoclaved sand was only achieved after the addition of \n\nnon-autoclaved soil extract. Malajczuk and Bowen (1974) also demonstrated \n\nthat Banksia grandis grown in two ?-irradiated soil types only produced proteoid \n\nroots after inoculation with a proteoid root extract. At present, proteoid root \n\nformation is suggested to be triggered by auxins released by free-living \n\nrhizosphere bacteria (Glick et al., 1994). The application of exogenous synthetic \n\nauxins to Lupinus albus induced proteoid root formation, even when plants were \n\ngrown with high P supply (Gilbert et al., 2000; Skene and James, 2000). In \n\ncontrast, inhibitors of auxin transport suppressed cluster root growth in  \n\nP-deficient Lupinus albus. The soil layers rich in decomposing organic matter \n\nand presenting an active nutrient release usually have higher bacteria content. \n\nBeing induced by bacteria, proteoid roots would be preferentially developed in \n\nsoil portions where nutrient concentration is potentially higher. Thus, the \n\nexploration of soil regions completely depleted from Pi will be limited even for \n\nproteoid-forming species. \n\n1.3 HAKEA SERICEA AS AN INVADER OF NATURAL HABITATS \n\n1.3.1 Biotic invasions \n\nAccording to Elton (1958), a biotic invader can be defined as an organism that, \n\nafter arriving to a new habitat, proliferates, spreads and persists over time. \n\nBiotic invasions can occur naturally, but in the last 500 years their frequency \n\nand number of species involved have dramatically increased, as a result of \n\nhuman activity, such as migrations and commerce (Wells et al., 1986; di Castri, \n\n1989). As a consequence, at the present it is difficult to find habitats on earth \n\nfree of species introduced by humans (Mack et al., 2000). Fortunately, not every \n\nspecies introduced in a new habitat become invaders. Most are quickly \n\neliminated by physical and biotic agents present at the arriving site (Kruger  \n\net al., 1986; Mack, 1995). Some survive and reproduce, but their descendants \n\nproliferate only for a few generations before becoming extinct. Consequently, \n\n\n\n1.3 HAKEA SERICEA AS AN INVADER OF NATURAL HABITATS \n\n~ 20 ~ \n\nonly a very small number of species eventually persist and adapt to the new \n\nhabitat, becoming naturalized. Finally, from this group of survivalists, only a few \n\nwill become invaders and even those may take decades before becoming \n\nabundant and widespread. One example is the Brazilian pepper (Schinus \n\nterebinthifolius), a bush that grows in dense stands excluding the growth of any \n\nother vegetation. Although introduced to Florida in the 19th century, only in the \n\nearly 1960s it became invasive (Schmitz et al., 1997). Different theories have \n\nbeen proposed to explain this lag phase: (1) some populations are so small and \n\nisolated that even in exponential growth phase they may not be detected - this \n\ncould be wrongly perceived as a lag phase (Crooks and Soule, 1996);  \n\n(2) genetic variation along generations may favour new genotypes allowing \n\nspecies to better cope with environmental factors in the new habitat \u2013 the lag \n\nphase would reflect the period needed for emergence of these new genotypes \n\n(Baker, 1974; Crooks and Soule, 1996) and finally, (3) environmental conditions \n\nmay alter during time, triggering the spreading of naturalized species \n\n(Simberloff, 1988). \n\nConcerning the threat to global biodiversity, the alteration of the earth biota \n\ncaused by invasive species is the second most important factor following the \n\ndirect destruction of habitat (Walker and Steffen, 1997). The ecological \n\nalterations include changing the role of autochthon species in communities, \n\ndisrupting evolutionary processes, and causing changes in relative abundances, \n\nultimately leading to extinctions (Cronk and Fuller, 1995; Rhymer and \n\nSimberloff, 1996). In many cases, the consequence of a biotic invasion is the \n\ncomplete replacement of native species by the invader. Examples are found in \n\nnorthern Australia, where 80.000 ha of heterogeneous tropical wetland habitat \n\nwere transformed into a uniform Mimosa pigra shrubland (Braithwaite  \n\net al., 1989). Also, in Florida, USA, the Australian paperbark tree (Melaleuca \n\nquinquenervia) has claimed 160.000 ha, replacing cypress and sawgrass \n\namongst other native species. In Cape Province, South Africa, eucalypts, pines, \n\nAcacia, and Hakea spp. have threatened the survival of many endemic species \n\nby removing enormous amounts of water from soil (van Wilgen et al., 1996). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 21 ~ \n\nInvasive plants have developed diverse features that confer them adaptive \n\nadvantages over natives. Many limit the light, water or minerals available to the \n\nnative plants; some release phytotoxic agents into the soil; while others are just \n\nable to grow faster or stronger following a natural disaster. For example, \n\nCarpobrotus edulis, a succulent mat-former introduced to California, usurps the \n\nwater in the soil, making it unavailable for native species (D\u2019Antonio and Mahall, \n\n1991). \n\nWhen plant invasions are detected early, it is possible to eradicate them \n\n(Simberloff, 1997). In many cases, however, early eradication is not followed \n\nbecause regulatory agencies feel that control is neither worth the trouble nor the \n\nexpense. Often, agencies tend to act only when the alien species becomes \n\ncompletely widespread and invasive. Unfortunately, in most cases, once the \n\ninvasion is fully established, it is extremely difficult to control (Simberloff, 1997). \n\n1.3.2 Hakea sericea as a biotic invader \n\nNative from south-eastern Australia, Hakea sericea was introduced to South \n\nAfrica during the 1930s as a hedge plant (Neser and Fugler, 1978). However, \n\nits copious seed production and serotiny, associated with high seed longevity in \n\nthe canopy and efficient seed dispersal, allowed H. sericea to rapidly proliferate \n\nand disperse throughout the new habitat, invading thousands of hectares of \n\nfynbos in South Africa (Richardson et al., 1989). Moreover, the woody follicles \n\nproduced by H. sericea only release the trapped winged seeds after fires or \n\nupon the death of plants (Richardson and van Wilgen, 1986; Bradstock, 1991). \n\nSince the fynbos ecosystem is fire-prone, meaning that the fynbos vegetation \n\nrelies on periodic fires for its own regeneration, the invasion by H. sericea has \n\nbeen strongly intensified (van Wilgen, 1981; van Wilgen and Richardson, 1985). \n\nThe presence of H. sericea by itself promotes fires, since it increases fuel loads, \n\nwhile at the same time decreases herbaceous fuel moisture (Versfeld and van \n\nWilgen, 1986). By forming dense and impenetrable stands of shrubs that put in \n\njeopardy the autochthon fynbos vegetation, H. sericea shortly became a major \n\nproblem in most costal mountain ranges and catchments of the Western Cape \n\nProvince (Richardson et al., 1989; Gordon, 1999). \n\n\n\n1.3 HAKEA SERICEA AS AN INVADER OF NATURAL HABITATS \n\n~ 22 ~ \n\nIn 1970, a biological control programme against H. sericea focusing the use of \n\ninsects was initiated (Neser and Annecke, 1973; Gordon, 1999). The \n\nprogramme consisted in the introduction of non-autochthon species such as \n\nCarposina autologa, a moth whose larvae feed on H. sericea seeds, and \n\nErytenna consputa, a weevil that destroys the developing fruits of H. sericea. \n\nMechanical methods (felling and fire) were also tested and cleared large \n\ninvaded areas. However, problems occurred with high intensity burning due to \n\nexcessive fuel loads, which led to damage of the soil, seedbanks and soil \n\nmicrobial populations (Cilliers et al., 2004). At present, control of H. sericea in \n\nSouth Africa is still dependant on seed-feeding insects, although their impact is \n\nseverely constrained by numerous factors, notably fires. \n\nH. sericea was also introduced to Portugal as a hedge plant to form fence lines \n\nor windbreaks, due to its dense and impenetrable cover. It is currently \n\nconsidered by regulatory agencies one of the most invasive plant species \n\nestablished in Portuguese territory (Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica, Decreto-Lei n\u00ba 565/99, \n\n21 de Dezembro). The same morphological and physiological traits that made it \n\ninvasive in South Africa allowed H. sericea to spread in Portugal, mostly \n\nthroughout the north-west region (Fig 1.6).  \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 Proliferation and spreading of H. sericea standings throughout \u201cSerra de \nArga\u201d in northern Portugal. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 - GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n~ 23 ~ \n\nUntil now, no large scale attempts have been made to control H. sericea \n\nspreading, although mechanical control methods have been tested with relative \n\nsuccess in the military field of St\u00aa Margarida (south of Tagus river, Santar\u00e9m \n\ndistrict) (Esp\u00edrito-Santo and Ars\u00e9nio, 1999).  \n\nThe aim of the present study is (1) to identify a pathogenic agent able to infect \n\nH. sericea, which could be used as a biological control agent of the invader, as \n\nwell as (2) to better understand the ecophysiological features underlying the \n\nability of H. sericea to invade new territories, specifically, its capability to survive \n\nin poor nutrient soils. \n\n \n\n\n\n1.4 REFERENCES \n\n~ 24 ~ \n\n1.4 REFERENCES \n\nAe N, Arihara J, Okada K, Yoshihara T and Johansen C, 1990.

In northern Portugal, dense stands \n\nare rapidly spreading after forest fire. Unusual leaf spots were observed on \n\nnaturally growing plants. Infected plants exhibited reddish leaves bearing black, \n\n1-3 mm circular lesions. Leaf sections containing necrotic lesions were plated \n\nonto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and eight fungal isolates were obtained. Pure \n\ncultures exhibited pinkish mycelium, bearing compact acervuli that contained \n\nblack slimy spore masses. Microscopic observation revealed typical \n\nPestalotiopsis sp. 5-celled spores (3 coloured median and 2 hyaline end cells) \n\nwith 3-4 apical and 1 basal appendages. Genomic DNA from fungi isolates was \n\npurified and used in thermocyclic amplifications with ITS5 and ITS4 internal \n\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) universal primers. The amplified sequences from all \n\nfungal isolates were identical to each other and only four base pair different \n\n(99.3% similarity) from Pestalotiopsis funerea. To confirm the pathogenicity of \n\nP. funerea on H. sericea, leaf-wounded and non-wounded 6 week-old in vitro \n\nplants were sprayed with a suspension containing 105 spores per mL or with \n\nsterile water. After 6 days, only leaf-wounded plants infected by P. funerea \n\nexhibited lesions identical to those observed in field plants, bearing fungus \n\nspores identical to those from original isolates. Members of Pestalotiopsis \n\ngenus have been described as pathogenic for Proteaceae species. In South \n\nAfrica where H. sericea invasion has become a problem, its biological control \n\nhas been successfully achieved using Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The \n\nidentification of naturally occurring pathogenic fungi in portuguese H. sericea \n\ncould allow the design of an integrated control strategy for this invader. \n\nPublished in Plant Pathology (2004) 53, 535 in modified form. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL \n\n~ 39 ~ \n\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nBiotic invaders can be defined as species that outside their natural range are \n\nstill able to proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment \n\n(Mack et al., 2000). Invasive exotic species threaten native biodiversity (Wilcove \n\net al., 1998) and alter fundamental ecological properties. They can change the \n\nabundance and distribution of species in a community and modify ecosystem \n\nphysical features, such as nutrient cycling and plant productivity (Bertness, \n\n1984; Vitousek, 1990). Moreover, invasive species have been identified as the \n\nsecond greatest threat to biodiversity after habitat loss (Mack et al., 2000) and \n\nannually cost up to $120 billion in the United States alone (Pimentel et al., \n\n2005). \n\nControl of invasive exotic species is usually achieved through three main \n\napproaches applied singly or in combination: chemical, mechanical, and \n\nbiological control. Introduced about 1895 (Hansen, 1921), chemical control \n\nprobably remains the chief tool in combating invasive species (Mack et al., \n\n2000). Herbicides usually inhibit the growth and establishment of plants by \n\ninterfering with various physiological and biochemical pathways (Inderjit, 2004). \n\nChemical control, however, has been too often related with health issues for \n\nhumans and non-target species (Acquavella et al., 1999). Moreover, if the goal \n\nis to control an invasive species in a vast natural area, the cost of chemical \n\nmethods alone can be prohibitive. Finally, the frequent evolution of plant \n\nresistance and the necessity of repeated applications often make continued \n\nchemical control impossible (Mack et al., 2000). Mechanical methods for \n\ncontrolling invasive species have shown to be quite effective (Roberts et al., \n\n1996; Alem\u00e1n, 2001) and encompass an array of tools ranging from harrows to \n\nbrushes and hoes to disrupt weed growth (Tillett, 1999). However, equipment \n\nexpenses, rough landscapes, and the geographic scale of some weed \n\ninfestations frequently render mechanical control impossible (Mack et al., 2000). \n\nThe perception of high economic, health and environmental costs of both \n\nchemical and mechanical weed control has stimulated interest in biological \n\n\n\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \n\n~ 40 ~ \n\ncontrol (Louda et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2005). This type of control is seen as an \n\nespecially attractive option for large natural areas, such as parks, reserves, \n\nnational forests, and open rangelands (Center et al., 1995). Biological control \n\nmethods include crop competition, allelopathy, and more frequently, the \n\nintroduction of specific insect predators, herbivores and plant pathogens \n\n(Inderjit, 2004). Some biological control projects have succeeded in restraining \n\nvery widespread, damaging infestations at acceptable levels with minimal costs \n\n(Westbrooks, 1998; Britton et al., 2002). \n\nHakea sericea Schrad. (Proteaceae) is native of south-eastern Australia and \n\nhas been considered as an invader of natural habitats. It grows into large woody \n\nand dense shrubs, with 6 cm-long rigid leaves. These dense stands of  \n\nH. sericea transform the natural landscape, thus modifying many ecosystem \n\nprocesses and reducing the diversity of indigenous species (Richardson et al., \n\n1989). In Portugal, it was first introduced as a hedge plant to form fence lines or \n\nwindbreaks, because of its dense and impenetrable cover, but became an \n\necological problem due to its high adaptability to climatic conditions and \n\ncapacity to survive to frequent forest fires. Actually, aspects of H. sericea \n\nreproduction and regeneration turn this species as one of the most dangerous \n\nand aggressive invader in Portugal. Plants are able to regenerate not only from \n\nseeds but also from rootstocks. Winged seeds are produced in large number \n\nand held in woody follicles until the parent plant dies. When parent shrubs are \n\nkilled by fire, the release of the large accumulated seed store is strongly \n\npromoted. Most seeds fall near the parent forming dense stands, but some are \n\ndispersed by wind. Seeds germinate rapidly and viable seeds are produced \n\nafter 2 years upon germination (Dyer and Richardson, 1992). Mechanical \n\ncontrol methods have been tested with some success in the military field of \n\nSt\u00aa Margarida (south of Tagus river, Santar\u00e9m district), being, to our knowledge, \n\nthe only form of control practiced in Portugal (Esp\u00edrito-Santo and Ars\u00e9nio, \n\n1999). Despite the promising results, this control method cannot be applied in \n\nthe northern region of Portugal, where the landscape is much rougher. The aim \n\nof our work is to identify a pathogenic agent able to infect H. sericea, which \n\ncould, in a nearby future, be used for the biological control of the invader. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL \n\n~ 41 ~ \n\n2.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n2.2.1 Plant material \n\nMature follicles (>2 years old) from Hakea sericea adult plants were collected in \n\n\u201cSerra de Arga\u201d mountains (430-450 m elevation), northern Portugal, centered \n\nat 8\u00ba 45' 06'' W, and 41\u00ba 51' 20'' N. After opening the follicles at 125\u00baC for 1 h, \n\nthe recovered seeds were water-embedded overnight. Seed surface was \n\ndisinfected by 35% (v/v) H2O2 immersion for 15 min, followed by thorough \n\nrinsing using sterile water. To break dormancy, seeds were placed for one week \n\nat 4\u00baC in the dark. Sterile H. sericea seedlings were obtained by germinating \n\nseeds in MS medium (0.185 g.L-1 MgSO4.7H2O, 0.22 g.L-1 CaCl2.2H2O, \n\n0.95 g.L-1 KNO3, 0.825 g.L-1 NH4NO3, 0.085 g.L-1 KH2PO4, 16.9 mg.L-1 \n\nMnSO4.H2O, 0.83 mg.L-1 KI, 0.025 mg.L-1 CoCl2.6H2O, 8.6 mg.L-1 ZnSO4.7H2O, \n\n0.025 mg.L-1 CuSO4.5H2O, 6.2 mg.L-1 H3BO3, 0.25 mg.L-1 Na2MoO4.2H2O, \n\n27.8 mg.L-1 FeSO4.7H2O, 41.3 mg.L-1 Na2EDTA.2H2O, 20 g.L-1 sucrose and \n\n7 g.L-1 agar, pH 6.0), using a 16/8 h photoperiod under cool white fluorescent \n\nlight (150 ?W.cm-2), at 25\u00baC in a growth chamber. To prevent dehydration of the \n\nmedium, cotton corks were partially flamed and double capped with aluminum \n\nfoil. Seedlings were allowed to develop for 6 weeks. \n\n2.2.2 Fungal material \n\nFungal isolates were obtained from circular lesions on the mature leaves of \n\ndiseased plants of H. sericea grown in \u201cSerra de Arga\u201d. Leaf sections containing \n\nnecrotic lesions were plated onto PDA and mycelium was allowed to grow in the \n\ndark at 25\u00baC, for 20 days. Following acervuli formation, spores were harvested \n\nwith a sterile needle and plated onto new sterile plates of PDA. The process \n\nwas systematically repeated (up to 6 times) until pure cultures were obtained. \n\nSpores were observed under a light microscope for genus identification. \n\n\n\n2.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n~ 42 ~ \n\n2.2.3 Inoculation \n\nSpore suspensions were obtained from 7-day-old Petri dish pure cultures by \n\nwashing the mycelium with sterile deionised water. Spore concentrations were \n\nadjusted by dilution after counting with a haemocytometer. Leaves of in vitro \n\ngrown 6-weeks-old plants, either intact or induced-wounded by a bisturi, were \n\nsprayed with 1 mL of inoculum containing 105 spores. Incubation proceeded as \n\nused for growing (16/8 h photoperiod, at 25\u00baC) for 6 days. Control plants (intact \n\nor induced-wounded) were treated with sterile deionised water. \n\n2.2.4 Extraction of fungal DNA \n\nFungal mycelium was obtained from 200 mL cultures (0.4 g.L-1 sucrose, \n\n0.04 g.L-1 yeast extract, 0.04 g.L-1 peptone, 0.1 g.L-1 MgSO4, 0.108 g.L-1 \n\nKH2PO4) (Mathur et al., 1950), incubated three days at 28\u00baC, with shaking \n\n(140 rpm). After collecting on Scott paper, the mycelium was ground to a fine \n\npowder in liquid N2 and stored at -20\u00baC. Fungal gDNA was extracted using the \n\nDNeasy\u00ae Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the supplier\u2019s instructions. Briefly, \n\nafter cell lysis and protein and polysaccharide precipitation, the lysate \n\ncontaining DNA was applied to a QIAshredder\u2122 Mini Spin Column (Qiagen). \n\nDNA was washed using a kit provided washing buffer and 100 \u00b5L of Buffer AE \n\n(10 mM Tris-Cl, 0.5 mM EDTA pH 9.0) were used for eluting the DNA. After \n\nincubating the DNeasy\u00ae membrane for 5 min at 25\u00baC, DNA was recovered by \n\ncentrifugation for 1 min at 6000 g. \n\n2.2.5 Spectrophotometric quantification of DNA \n\nQuantification of DNA was performed spectrophotometrically by measuring the \n\nA260 of sample solution on a Cary 1E UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Varian). For \n\nestimation of DNA concentration, it was considered that 1 A260 = 50 ng.?L-1 \n\nDNA. Purity was evaluated after determining the values of A230 and A280 \n\n(Sambrook et al., 1989). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL \n\n~ 43 ~ \n\n2.2.6 rDNA amplification and sequencing \n\nThermocyclic amplification of the ITS and 5.8S rRNA subunit regions of the \n\nfungal rDNA was carried out using ITS4 and ITS5 universal primers (White  \n\net al., 1990). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the \n\nPureTaq\u2122 Ready-to-Go\u2122 PCR Beads (GE Healthcare), according to the \n\nsupplier\u2019s instructions. For each PCR, 25 pmol of ITS4, 25 pmol of ITS5 and  \n\n50 ng of fungal gDNA were used. Sterile high-quality water was added to each \n\nbead to a final volume of 25 \u00b5L. The final concentration of each dNTP was \n\n200 \u00b5M in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at room temperature),  \n\n50 mM KCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2. After gently flicking the tube with a finger, and \n\nbringing the components back to the bottom of the tube with a few seconds \n\ncentrifugation, the beads were placed on a Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf). \n\nPCR steps were as follows: (1) denaturation for 5 min at 95\u00b0C; (2) 25 cycles of \n\nannealing for 30 s at 50.4\u00baC, 55.1\u00baC or 60.1\u00baC, polymerization for 1 min at \n\n72\u00baC, denaturation for 30 s at 95\u00baC; (3) extension for 10 min at 72\u00b0C. \n\nDNA fragments were resolved by electrophoretic separation using horizontal \n\nslab gel apparatus. According to the expected length of the amplified fragments, \n\nan agarose concentration of 1.2% (w/v) was used. Gel was made by melting \n\nagarose in 0.5\u00d7 TBE (45 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA), also used \nas running buffer. DNA samples, including molecular weight marker (1 kb DNA \n\nLadder, Invitrogen), were mixed with 0.25 vol. of loading buffer [glycerol 30% \n\n(w/v), 0.1 M EDTA and bromophenol blue 0.25% (w/v)] and 1 ?L of 1 mg.mL-1 \n\nEtBr. Electrophoresis was carried out at 80 V, until the bromophenol blue dye \n\nhad reached two thirds the length of the gel. The agarose gel was visualized \n\nunder long wave UV light (Transilluminator 2020E, Stratagene) and analyzed \n\nusing the Eagle Eye\u00ae II Still Video System (Stratagene) through corresponding \n\nsoftware (EagleSight\u2122 3.2, Stratagene). \n\nDNA fragments used for sequencing were directly purified from the PureTaq\u2122 \n\nReady-to-Go\u2122 PCR Beads solution, after running a PCR using 60\u00baC as \n\nannealing temperature. For DNA purification, GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band \n\nPurification Kit (Amersham) was used. Briefly, the DNA solution was transferred \n\n\n\n2.4 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n~ 44 ~ \n\nto a GFX Column, from which salt contaminants, primers and free nucleotides \n\nwere washed away using a kit provided washing buffer. After applying 50 \u00b5L of \n\nsterile ultrapure water and incubating for 1 min, DNA was recovered by \n\ncentrifugation for 1 min at 8000 g. \n\nDNA fragments were sequenced in both directions using ITS4 and ITS5 primers \n\nby BigDye\u2122 Terminator Chemistry (ABI Prism\u00ae; Stabvida sequencing services).  \n\n2.2.7 Sequence analysis \n\nNucleotide editing and analysis was performed using the sequence analysis \n\nsoftware from DNASTAR (Lasergene). Within the software package, EditSeq \n\nwas used to edit sequences and multiple sequence alignments were generated \n\nwith MegAlign, using the ClustalW algorithm (Jeanmougin et al., 1998).  \n\nThe unrooted phylogenetic tree, based on the alignment of fungal ITS \n\nsequences, was constructed using the DrawTree, PHYLIP software suit \n\n(Felsenstein, 1989). The maximum likelihood method (Doyle and Gaut, 2000) \n\nwas used to resolve the phylogenetic relationship between the isolated fungus \n\nand the remaining selected species. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL \n\n~ 45 ~ \n\n2.3 RESULTS \n\nAs referred to in the Introduction (section 2.1), the Proteaceae Hakea sericea \n\nhas proven to be invasive in some regions outside its natural range. In Portugal, \n\nit was first introduced as a hedge plant because of its dense and impenetrable \n\ncover, but became an ecological problem due to its high adaptability to climatic \n\nconditions and capacity to survive to frequent forest fires. Hard and woody \n\nfollicles accumulate for years and massively open upon plant dehydration, \n\neither when the plant dies or is burnt. Two large winged seeds are then \n\nreleased per follicle. As a consequence, vast areas of pine and oak forests have \n\nbeen replaced by H. sericea, like those occurring in \u201cSerra de Arga\u201d mountain, \n\nnorthern Portugal (Fig 2.1). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 Hakea sericea harvesting region located in \u201cSerra de Arga\u201d mountain, \nnorthern Portugal, centred at 8\u00ba 45' 06'' W, and 41\u00ba 51' 20'' N. \n\nThe region is shown both as a digital orthophoto (A) and as a topographic map (B). Elevation is in meters. \nThe distribution of H. sericea throughout continental Portugal is also displayed in the minimap (C). \n\n\n\n2.3 RESULTS \n\n~ 46 ~ \n\nWhen scouting the \u201cSerra de Arga\u201d area, it was noticed that some H. sericea \n\nspecimens presented a slight reddish colour with chlorotic leaf spots. The \n\napparently diseased specimens were harvested and observed under stereo \n\nmicroscopy in the lab (Fig 2.2). Unusual black 1-3 mm circular lesions were \n\nobserved, suggesting leaf infection by some sort of pathogenic fungus. After \n\nplating leaf sections containing necrotic lesions onto PDA for 20 days, eight \n\nfungal isolates were obtained. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 Chlorotic leaf spots on H. sericea infected leaves \n\n (stereo microscope, bars = 2 mm). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL \n\n~ 47 ~ \n\nPure fungal cultures exhibited a pinkish mycelium upon 1 week of culture  \n\n(Fig 2.3.A). Compact acervuli containing black slimy spore masses were visible \n\nafter 4 weeks of culture (Fig 2.3.B). Microscopic observation revealed typical \n\nPestalotiopsis sp. five-celled spores (three coloured median and two hyaline \n\nend cells) with three apical and one basal appendages (Fig 2.3.C). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 Pestalotiopsis isolate collected from infected Hakea sericea leaves. \n\nMycelium growth on PDA, 1 (A) and 4 (B) weeks after inoculation and corresponding conidia [(C), light \nmicroscopy, bar = 20 \u00b5m]. \n\nThe genus Pestalotiopsis is a heterogeneous group of coelomycetous fungi \n\nwhere species are defined primarily based on conidial characteristics or \n\nconidiogenesis (Jeewon et al., 2003). In order to further identify the \n\nPestalotiopsis sp. isolated from infected H. sericea, the ITS region of the fungal \n\nrDNA was amplified, using ITS4 and ITS5 universal primers (White et al., 1990). \n\nThe electrophoretic analysis of the obtained PCR products showed the \n\n\n\n2.3 RESULTS \n\n~ 48 ~ \n\namplification of a 599 bp fragment, regardless the annealing temperature used \n\n(50.4\u00baC, 55.1\u00baC or 60.1\u00baC) (Fig 2.4). The fragment obtained with the highest \n\nstringent condition (60\u00baC) was selected for sequencing, since the probability of \n\nunspecific contaminant amplifications would be much lower. This newly \n\nobtained ITS sequence was then compared with orthologs from the \n\nAmphisphaeriaceae family, where the Pestalotiopsis genus is included. The \n\nmultiple alignment was performed using the ClustalW method and the unrooted \n\ntree was plotted using the maximum-likelihood algorithm (Figs 2.5 and 2.6). \n\nThis analysis indicated that the isolated fungus is very similar to Pestalotiopsis \n\nfunerea (99.3% similarity). To our knowledge, this was the first report of a \n\nnaturally occurring pathogenic fungus in portuguese H. sericea stands. \n\n \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 2.4 Amplification of ITS regions from Pestalotiopsis genome. \n\nPosition of the universal primers ITS4 and ITS5 in fungal nuclear rDNA, with arrowheads representing the \n3\u2019 end of each primer (A).

H. sericea spreading compromises natural regeneration of \n\nthe main forest species, and has a profound negative impact on animal \n\nbiodiversity. Introduced to South Africa from Australia during the 1930s as a \n\nhedge plant, H. sericea has become a major problem in nearly all of the coastal \n\nmountain ranges and catchments of the Western Cape Province (Neser and \n\nFugler 1978; Richardson and van Wilgen, 1986). At the time, control of \n\nH. sericea involved felling the shrubs and leaving them in situ for releasing \n\ncanopy-stored seeds. The area was then burnt once the seeds had germinated \n\nto kill the seedlings (Fenn, 1980; Richardson and van Wilgen, 1986). There are, \n\nhowever, several issues associated with mechanical control combined with \n\ncontrolled burning. In very dense stands fires may not spread through the \n\ncrowns of Hakea shrubs. In opposition, the additional fuel load of dead \n\nH. sericea plants can result in exceptionally intense fires which may \n\ncompromise the recovery of autochthon elements (Richardson and Manders, \n\n1985). Also, the follow-up time-consuming operations required to eradicate \n\nresultant seedlings can be hampered by the standing dead shrubs, making such \n\noperations prohibitively expensive. \n\nBiological control of H. sericea in South Africa was initiated in 1970 and \n\nfocussed on the release of insects that reduce seed production and seedling \n\ndevelopment (Neser and Annecke, 1973; Gordon, 1999). The larvae of a fruit \n\nweevil, Erytenna consputa, from Australia, destroy the young seeds and stunt \n\nthe development of the fruit capsule. Also from Australia, the larvae of a seed \n\nmoth, Carposina autologa, destroy any mature seeds that have been produced. \n\nThe shoot-boring weevil Cydmaea binotata Lea was released in 1979 to \n\nsuppress seedling regeneration. However, in opposition to E. consputa and \n\nC. autologa, this insect has been mostly ineffective at the few sites where it \n\nbecame established (Kluge and Neser, 1991). Nevertheless, the interaction \n\n\n\n2.4 DISCUSSION \n\n~ 54 ~ \n\nbetween these agents and Portuguese autochthon H. sericea has never been \n\nstudied, making them unsuitable for biological control, at least for the moment.  \n\nActive human dispersal of spores of the virulent fungal pathogen Colletotrichum \n\ngloeosporioides was also tested in South Africa (Richardson and Manders, \n\n1985; Morris, 1991). The analysis of the symptoms progression of the disease \n\nover 21 months, allowed the prediction of about 82% mortality after  \n\n10 years. Despite these promising results, the use of C. gloeosporioides as a \n\nbiological control agent in Portugal seems unlikely, since several autochthon \n\nspecies of economic interest can also be infected by this pathogen. For \n\nexample, in olives (Olea europaea), C. gloeosporioides can cause major yield \n\nlosses and poor oil quality (Talhinhas et al., 2005). Several subtropical and \n\ntemperate fruits, such as grapevine, nectarine, apple and peach can also be \n\naffected by C. gloeosporioides (Freeman and Shabi, 1996; Ramos et al., 2006). \n\nIn Portugal, to our knowledge, no large scale control measures have been taken \n\nso far. Since mechanical or chemical control seem unfit to apply in the rough \n\nnorthern Portugal landscape, it seems imperative to find alternative biological \n\nagents that can be used in H. sericea control. \n\nBased on this assumption, apparently diseased specimens bearing necrotic \n\nlesions were harvested from their natural environment in \u201cSerra de Arga\u201d from \n\nwhich several fungal isolates were obtained. Microscopic observation revealed \n\ntypical Pestalotiopsis spp. five-celled spores with three apical and one basal \n\nappendages. This result was in agreement with the detection of black 1-3 mm \n\ncircular lesions observed on infected leaves, corresponding to the typical leaf \n\nspots caused by this agent (Keith et al., 2006). \n\nPestalotiopsis Steyaert consists of approximately 205 described species \n\nbroadly distributed in the world (Wang et al., 2005). Most species are plant \n\npathogens, causing disease in plants such as Camellia sinensis (Wei et al., \n\n2007), Phoenix roebelenii (Ushida, 2004), and Proteaceae Protea and Telopea \n\n(Crous et al., 2000), while others are saprobes in soil and in plant debris \n\n(reviewed by Hu et al., 2007). Espinosa-Garcia and Langenheim (1990) first \n\nreported Pestalotiopsis funerea as an ecologically important endophyte from \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL \n\n~ 55 ~ \n\nSequoia sempervirens. Several Pestalotiopsis species have since been isolated \n\nas endophytes (reviewed by Hu et al., 2007), some of which have the ability to \n\nproduce taxol, which had been reported to be effective against cancer (Qiu  \n\net al., 1994; Strobel et al., 1996).  \n\nThe identification of Pestalotiopsis is primarily based on morphologic unique \n\ncharacters, mainly by the presence of a fusiform conidia formed within compact \n\nacervuli. The conidia are usually five-celled, with three pigmented median cells \n\nand hyaline end cells (Griffiths and Swart, 1974; Jeewon et al., 2003; Keith  \n\net al., 2006). The pigmentation of the median cells ranging from light brown and \n\ndark brown to varying shades of olive green, results from the deposition of \n\nmelanin granules within the cell matrix (Keith et al., 2006). The presence of two \n\nto four apical appendages arising from the apical cell and a centric basal \n\nappendage is also typical for Pestalotiopsis conidia. \n\nAlthough Pestalotiopsis genus is easily distinguishable with cultural and \n\nmorphological characterization of conidia, the proper identification at the \n\nspecies level is problematic because there are few valid morphological \n\ncharacters available and they frequently overlap. For example, the \n\nmorphological difference among P. disseminata, P. neglecta and P. uvicola is \n\nobscure and species designation appears to be based on personal opinions (Hu \n\net al., 2007). The identification based on cultural and morphologic characters is \n\neven more problematic due the variation occurring between subcultures of the \n\nsame isolate (Hu et al., 2007). When strains were cultured in the same media \n\nand under the same environmental conditions, conidial length, conidial width \n\nand length of the three median pigmented cells remained similar even after \n\nseveral subcultures. However, the length of apical and basal appendages can \n\nbe variable, possibly being affected due to growth in the artificial media. When a \n\nP. funerea strain was first isolated, the average length of apical appendages \n\nwas 12.5-22.5 ?m, being reduced to 5-15 ?m long after being subcultured twice \n\n(Hu et al., 2007). Since most species in this genus have few morphologic \n\ncharacters that overlap in many aspects and vary upon subculturing, the \n\ntaxonomy of Pestalotiopsis has been equivocal and resolved differently by \n\nvarious authors (Steyeart, 1949; Guba, 1961; Sutton, 1980; Nag Rag, 1993).  \n\n\n\n2.4 DISCUSSION \n\n~ 56 ~ \n\nComparative studies of the nucleotide sequences of rRNA and/or ?-tubulin \n\ngenes have been conducted as a means for analysing phylogenetic \n\nrelationships between Pestalotiopsis and other closely related genera species \n\n(Jeewon et al., 2003; Keith et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2007). The molecular data \n\nobtained do not tend always to reveal a close relationship among species with \n\nsimilar conidia, revealing once more the complex nature of Pestalotiopsis genus \n\nand the difficulty in classifying it at species level (Jeewon et al., 2003; Keith et \n\nal., 2006). Therefore, the use of the recent molecular approaches provides a \n\nmeans to overcome the difficulties of more traditional methods. In this work, \n\nsequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of rRNA genes was used for \n\nidentifying fungal isolates obtained from H. sericea deseased plants. The ITS \n\nregion and intergenic spacer of the nuclear rRNA repeat units have evolved so \n\nfast that may vary among species within a genus or even among populations \n\n(White et al., 1990). The amplification and analysis of the ITS region of the \n\nisolated fungi indicated 99.3% similarity to the same sequence of Pestalotiopsis \n\nfunerea. In the unrooted tree representing the phylogenetic relation between \n\nPestalotiopsis species, P. maculans and P. karstenii are placed in the same \n\nbranch as P. funerea. Accordingly, these three species share many \n\nmorphological aspects such as the presence of three to four pigmented median \n\ncells, two to four apical appendages arising as tubular extensions and only one \n\nunbranched and central basal appendage (Jeewon et al., 2003). \n\nThe fungal pathogenic P. funerea occurs worldwide and it has been described \n\nhas a primary pathogen or as an opportunistic invader of conifers such as \n\nCupressus arizonica (Bajo et al., 2008), Pinus radiata (Gadgil, 2005) and Taxus \n\nbaccata (Thomas and Polwart, 2003), causing necrosis on infected tissues, and \n\nsometimes death of plants. To our knowledge, in this work was reported for the \n\nfirst time the infection of a Proteacea species by P. funerea.  \n\nWhen the Koch\u2019s postulates were tested by subjecting H. sericea sterile \n\nseedlings to the isolated P. funerea spores, it was observed that wounding prior \n\nto inoculation was necessary for disease development. Similar results were \n\nobtained with other species of Pestalotiopsis when infecting plants such as \n\nguava, rambutan, tea, or Miltonia orchids (Hopkins and McQuilken, 2000; \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL \n\n~ 57 ~ \n\nRivera and Wright, 2000; Keith et al., 2006). Also, plant wounding enhanced \n\nsymptom development, as was seen for ginger and lychee. Humidity and \n\ntemperature also seem to influence symptom development. While hot and dry \n\nconditions normally prevent dissemination of Pestalotiopsis (Tuset et al., 1999), \n\na humid atmosphere (Kaushik et al., 1972) or unusual climatic conditions \n\nincluding heavy rainfall are favourable for disease development (Tuset et al., \n\n1999). Altogether, these results suggest that Pestalotiopsis behaves as an \n\nopportunistic pathogen that affects stressed plants. Being native from southern \n\nAustralia, and thus more adapted to hot and dry conditions, infected specimens \n\nof H. sericea found in \u201cSerra de Arga\u201d may suffer from cold injury during winter, \n\nbecoming more susceptible to P. funerea attack. The requirement for stress \n\nimposition could make P. funerea a useful biological control agent, in \n\nassociation with mechanical or chemical methods. Although a control strategy \n\nbased on this assumption could leave non-wounded autochthon species safe \n\nfrom infection, more knowledge should be gained about P. funerea \n\npathogenicity potential against other hosts. Therefore, many questions arise \n\nwhen considering its use for biological control. Firstly, would the costs of \n\nproduction and dissemination of the fungal agent be affordable? And more \n\nimportant, how would P. funerea interact with the Portuguese autochthon \n\nspecies? Taking these into account, this paper should be understood as a basis \n\nfor further studies aiming the biological control of H. sericea using P. funerea as \n\npathogenic agent. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 - FIRST REPORT OF HAKEA SERICEA LEAF INFECTION CAUSED BY PESTALOTIOPSIS FUNEREA IN PORTUGAL \n\n~ 59 ~ \n\n2.5 REFERENCES \n\nAcquavella JF, Weber JA, Cullen MR, Cruz OA, Martens MA, Holden LR, Riordan S, Thompson \nM and Farmer D, 1999.

Here we report a \n\ncharacterization of the Pi uptake kinetics of the proteoid root-forming species \n\nHakea sericea Schrad. This Proteaceae is an Australian native, which is \n\ndisseminating very fast through forests of the European south. Dense mats of \n\nproteoid roots were observed in the upper soil layers of the invaded area in \n\nPortugal where availability of P and N was shown to be very low. Plants grown \n\nhydroponically under low-Pi also developed proteoid roots, and the proteoid \n\nclusters presented a major role in Pi absorption in comparison to the  \n\nnon-proteoid portions of the root system as revealed by their higher 32Pi \n\nlabeling. The 32Pi uptake by proteoid roots was dependent on H+ gradient and \n\nyielded a biphasic kinetics, suggesting the involvement of H+/Pi co-transport \n\nsystems with Km values of 0.225 and 40.8 \u00b5M Pi. The analogs phosphite (Phi) \n\nand arsenate, but not vanadate, inhibited competitively the Pi absorption. Such \n\nbiphasic Pi uptake pattern with the highest affinity at submicromolar range is \n\nlikely to be of critical importance for the capacity of this plant species to invade \n\nand proliferate throughout vast areas of nutrient-deprived soils. \n\nPublished in Plant Science (2007) 173, 550\u2013558. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA \n\n~ 69 ~ \n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nPhosphorus (P) is an important plant macronutrient, making up about 0.2% of \n\nplant dry weight. P deficiency limits plant growth more frequently than any other \n\nnutrients except nitrogen (Schachtman et al., 1998; Vance et al., 2003; \n\nRaghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). Although total soil P content typically \n\nvaries from 500 to 2000 mg.kg-1, total bioavailable P may be only a few mg.kg-1 \n\n(Vance et al., 2003). The form of P most readily accessed by plants is Pi, the \n\nconcentration of which rarely exceeds 10 mM in soil solutions (Bieleski, 1973). \n\nThe Pi level in soil solution is regulated mainly by its interaction with organic or \n\ninorganic surfaces in the soil. Aluminium and iron ions in acid soils, and calcium \n\nions in alkaline soils, interact strongly with Pi and render it unavailable to plants. \n\nConsequently, plants have developed numerous morphological, physiological, \n\nbiochemical and molecular adaptations to acquire Pi (Vance et al., 2003; \n\nRaghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). \n\nProteoid roots (or cluster roots) are considered, along with mycorrhizas and \n\nnitrogen-fixing nodules, to be one of the major adaptations to enhance nutrient \n\nacquisition (Skene, 2000). Along a proteoid root, discrete clusters of closely \n\nspaced rootlets develop. The rootlets emerge in continuous rows from the \n\ncortex and are covered with root hairs, increasing the absorption surface area \n\n(Watt and Evans, 1999). Species with proteoid roots can grow in soils with \n\npoorly available nutrients, and their induction has been reported mainly in \n\nresponse to low availability of P and Fe (Shane and Lambers, 2005). Until now \n\nthe ability of proteoid roots in improving Pi mobilization from soil has been \n\nrelated mainly to the increase of root surface area and exudation of carboxylic \n\nacids, acid phosphatases, phenolics, mucilages, and water (Watt and Evans, \n\n1999; Neumann and Martinoia, 2002; Lambers et al., 2006). \n\nHakea sericea Schrad. is a Proteaceae native in south-eastern Australia and its \n\nability to produce proteoid roots, together with the production of large number of \n\nseeds protected by woody follicles, efficient dispersal of seeds and rapid \n\ngermination, have enabled the species to become well-adapted to cope with \n\n\n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION \n\n~ 70 ~ \n\nfires and Pi-poor soils. These advantages have contributed to make H. sericea \n\nan aggressive invader of natural vegetation in the Mediterranean basin, similarly \n\nto what has been reported in New Zealand and South Africa (Dyer and \n\nRichardson, 1992). It has been postulated that Proteaceae species could \n\npresent enhanced Pi absorption capacity. This feature, in association with a \n\ndeficiency for down-regulating their Pi transport, may result in Pi toxicity \n\nsymptoms (Shane et al., 2003; Shane et al., 2004). Nevertheless, up to now, \n\ndetailed data on kinetics and energetics of Pi uptake by proteoid roots of Hakea \n\nspp. are still lacking, the only approach published so far showing transport \n\ndepending linearly on the external Pi concentration (Roelofs et al., 2001). The \n\npresent work reports a kinetic characterization of the Pi uptake system of the H. \n\nsericea proteoid roots and its relationship with the adaptive aspects of this \n\ninvasive species in nutrient-poor soils. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA \n\n~ 71 ~ \n\n3.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n3.2.1 Sampling area \n\nProteoid roots and follicles from wild H. sericea plants, as well as soil samples, \n\nwere collected in \u201cSerra de Arga\u201d mountains (430\u2013450 m elevation), northern \n\nPortugal, centred at 8\u00ba45\u201906\u201d W, and 41\u00ba51\u201920\u201dN. \n\n3.2.2 Soil analysis \n\nSamples were collected in 10\u201340 cm of depth in the soil, airdried and passed \n\nthrough a 2 mm sieve prior to analysis. Extractable P content was determined in \n\nthe modified Egner\u2013Riehm extract (Egner et al., 1960); Pi was measured \n\ncolorimetrically by the ascorbic acid method (Murphy and Riley, 1962). Total P \n\nwas extracted with aqua regia (HCl:HNO3, 3:1) and measured colorimetrically. \n\nMineral N content was determined in an aqueous extract of the soil (1:5) after \n\nreduction with FeSO4 and Ag+ followed by alkalinization. NH3 was separated by \n\ndistillation and titrated. Total N was determined by the Kjeldhal method \n\n(Bremner and Mulvaney, 1982). \n\n3.2.3 Hydroponic culture of H. sericea \n\nTo obtain hydroponically-grown  plants, follicles were opened at 120\u00baC for 1 h \n\nand seed dormancy was broken in the dark, at 4\u00baC for 1 week. Seeds were \n\nembedded for 24 h, and germination occurred in quartz sand. One-month \n\nseedlings were transferred to vessels containing 8 L mineral medium with 200 \n\n\u00b5M Ca(NO3)2, 100 \u00b5M MgSO4, 330 \u00b5M KNO3, 50 \u00b5M NH4NO3, 18\u00b5M H3BO3,  \n\n8 \u00b5M MnSO4, 0.16 \u00b5M CuSO4, 0.32 \u00b5M ZnSO4, 0.4 \u00b5M Na2MoO4, 20 \u00b5M \n\nFeEDTA, and 1, 100 or 1000 \u00b5M NaH2PO4 (depending on the experiment), at \n\npH 5.8. This nutrient solution was aerated and changed biweekly. The \n\nhydroponic system was kept in a green-house with a photoperiod of 16 h and a \n\nquantum irradiance of 200 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1, at 25\u00baC. After 6 weeks, cotyledons were \n\nremoved. To evaluate the effect of Pi availability on the induction of proteoid \n\nroots, two sets of seedlings were grown in different nutrient solutions containing \n\n\n\n3.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n~ 72 ~ \n\n1 \u00b5M or 100 \u00b5M of NaH2PO4. To study the correlation between plant P status \n\nand Pi uptake, plants grown in the 1 \u00b5M Pi nutrient solution were transferred to \n\na 1 mM Pi nutrient solution for 2 days prior to uptake experiments. \n\n3.2.4 Measurement of 32Pi uptake by proteoid roots \n\nRadioactive phosphate (32Pi) uptake experiments were carried out according to \n\na modified protocol of Sentenac and Grignon (1985). The assays were \n\nperformed in fresh proteoid root segments (excised proteoid roots) collected \n\nfrom hydroponically-grown  H. sericea plants. After sampling, proteoid roots \n\nwere carefully washed with deionised water and immediately used in 32Pi \n\nuptake experiments. In order to correlate the results obtained using roots from \n\nhydroponically-grown  plants with the Pi uptake phenomena occurring in plants \n\ngrowing in their natural environment, proteoid roots excised from wild-grown \n\nplants were also used in 32Pi uptake experiments. However, technical issues \n\nrelated with detachment of soil particles from the roots and extensive washing, \n\ntogether with the heterogeneity exhibited by the plant material, impaired \n\ndetailed analysis of 32Pi uptake. \n\nIn order to estimate initial 32Pi uptake rates, 50\u201370 mg FW of root segments \n\nwere incubated in 20 mL of transport solution (10 mM CaCl2, 20 mM MES and \n\n0.1\u2013100 \u00b5M H3PO4 labeled with 32Pi), adjusted to pH 4.5, 5.5, 6.0, or 6.5 to \n\nimpose transmembrane proton gradients, at 25\u00baC. 32Pi uptake was also \n\nmeasured in root segments pre-incubated with 100 \u00b5M of the protonophore \n\nCCCP and 100 \u00b5M TPP+ for 10 min to evaluate the dependence on proton \n\nelectrochemical gradient. After shaking for 2 min, a period that ensures linearity \n\nof uptake, the reaction was stopped by washing the root segments with ice-cold \n\n2 mM CaCl2 under vacuum. Root segments were transferred to 50 mL Falcon \n\ntubes containing 5 mL of 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and incubated for 12 h. Aliquots \n\nof extracts (0.5\u20132 mL) were transferred to vials containing scintillation fluid \n\n(OptiPhase HiSafe II; LKB Scintillation Products). The radioactivity was \n\nmeasured in a Packard Tri-Carb 2200 CA liquid scintillation counter (Packard \n\nInstruments Co. Inc., Rockville, MD). Non-specific binding of labeled Pi to the \n\nfilters and/or root cells was determined after root segments had been incubated \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA \n\n~ 73 ~ \n\nwith 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 12 h prior to uptake experiments and these \n\nresults were used to correct Pi uptake data. \n\n3.2.5 Effect of Pi analogs and mercurial reagents on 32Pi uptake \n\nInhibition of Pi transport by Phi, arsenate, or vanadate was assayed by adding \n\nsimultaneously 2 \u00b5M 32Pi and 1 mM of these compounds. The transport reaction \n\nwas stopped as described previously after 2 min of incubation. Competition \n\nbetween Pi and the analogs Phi and arsenate was tested by running \n\ncompetitive uptake kinetics. The transport reaction was started after the addition \n\nof the unlabeled substrates (250 \u00b5M). 32Pi transport was also measured in the \n\npresence of 100 \u00b5M HgCl2 or 250 \u00b5M mersalyl (mersalic acid), after proteoid \n\nroots had been pre-incubated during 10 min with the mercurial reagents. \n\n3.2.6 Calculation of kinetic parameters \n\nThe data of initial Pi uptake rates were analysed by a nonlinear regression \n\nanalysis (Graph-Pad Prism, version 4.0, Graph-Pad software, San Diego, CA, \n\nUSA). By this method, the transport kinetics best fitting the experimental initial \n\nuptake rates were determined, and estimates for the kinetic parameters were \n\nobtained. Substrate uptake is presented as mean \u00b1 SE, and n denotes the \n\nnumber of independent experiments. \n\n3.2.7 Autoradiography of 32Pi labeled roots \n\nRoot segments were incubated in 20 mL of 1 \u00b5M 32Pi transport solution and, at \n\nselected times, the reaction was stopped by washing the root segments with \n\nice-cold 2 mM CaCl2 under vacuum, as described previously for 32Pi uptake \n\nexperiments. Root segments were dried with paper and protected with a \n\ncellophane sheet. The labeling was visualized using a Bio-Rad Phosphorimager \n\nsystem (Molecular Imager\u00ae FX). \n\n3.2.8 Rhizosphere acidification by proteoid roots \n\nThe exudating activity of proteoid roots was determined according to Yan et al. \n\n(2002). Intact roots of 10-weeks-old plants were carefully washed with \n\n\n\n3.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n~ 74 ~ \n\ndeionised water, spread on an agar sheet containing 0.75% (w/v) agar, 0.006% \n\n(w/v) bromocresol purple, 2.5 mM K2SO4, and 1 mM CaSO4, at pH 6.0, and \n\nwere slightly pressed into the agar avoiding any damage to the roots. \n\nRhizosphere acidification was conducted under light for 5 h. Vanadate \n\nsensitivity of rhizosphere acidification by proteoid roots was determined by \n\nperforming the same experiment in an agar sheet with the same composition as \n\nthe one mentioned above, supplemented by 1 mM Na3VO4. \n\n3.2.9 Phosphate content determination \n\nPhosphate content was determined by sampling roots, stems and leaves of  \n\nH. sericea plants grown (a) in the wild, (b) in a 1 \u00b5M Pi nutrient solution, and (c) \n\nin a 1 \u00b5M Pi nutrient solution followed by 2-days-incubation in a 1 mM Pi \n\nnutrient solution. The excised tissues were rinsed in distilled water, oven-dried \n\nat 70\u00baC, for 36 h, and ashed in a muffle furnace, at 550\u00baC, for 3 h. Ashed plant \n\nsamples were digested with 10 mL of 1.4% (v/v) HNO3 solution. The digested \n\nsamples were filtered and analysed by inductively coupled plasma atomic \n\nemission spectrometry (ICP). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA \n\n~ 75 ~ \n\n3.3 RESULTS \n\n3.3.1 Kinetics of Pi uptake by H. sericea proteoid roots \n\nProteoid roots from wild H. sericea plants are similar to those of other Hakea \n\nspecies, showing dense clusters of rootlets covered with root hairs (Fig 3.1.A) at \n\nintervals along lateral secondary roots. Dense mats of proteoid roots were \n\nobserved in upper soil layers of the sampling area, where P and N availability \n\nwas very low, as follows: total P, 232 mg kg-1; Pi, 3.1 mg kg-1; total N, 0.07% \n\n(w/w); mineral N, 14 mg kg-1. When grown in hydroponics in a 1 \u00b5M Pi nutrient \n\nsolution, plants developed an average of 20 rootlet clusters throughout the root \n\nsystem within 8\u201310 weeks (Fig 3.1.B). Rootlet clusters ranged from juvenile  \n\n(8\u201312 days; white-coloured) to mature (14\u201318 days; light-brown-coloured). On \n\nthe other hand, plants grown in a 100 \u00b5M Pi nutrient solution failed to develop \n\nproteoid roots. \n\nThe contribution to the Pi uptake performed by root clusters in proteoid  \n\nroot-forming species is still a matter of controversy. The large differences in the \n\nmorphology and density of proteoid and non-proteoid root portions of the root \n\nsystem impair an accurate comparison of transport capacities when initial \n\nvelocities are expressed per unit of root dry or fresh weight. To circumvent this \n\nproblem, the comparison of Pi uptake in both root types was performed directly \n\nby autoradiography using the root system of H. sericea plants grown \n\nhydroponically in a 1 \u00b5M Pi nutrient solution. As can be seen in Fig 3.2.A the \n\nproteoid portions of the root system displayed a high labelling intensity \n\nsuggesting a major role on Pi uptake. As shown in Fig 3.2.B, intense \n\nacidification of rhizosphere was observed in the vicinity of the proteoid portions \n\nof H. sericea root system, most likely due to H+ pumping activity mediated by \n\nplasma membrane ATPase, since it was prevented by vanadate. Taking these \n\nresults into account, all the subsequent transport experiments were performed \n\nin proteoid portions of the H. sericea root system. \n\n\n\n3.3 RESULTS \n\n~ 76 ~ \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 External structure of proteoid roots in H. sericea.  \n\nExcised proteoid root collected from wild-grown H. sericea with densely spaced rootlets and root hairs \nobserved under light microscope (A).

A time period of incubation of 2 min \n\nwas subsequently used to estimate the initial uptake rates of 0.1\u2013150 \u00b5M 32Pi \n\n(initial concentrations) (Fig 3.3.B). The dependence of the initial velocities of Pi \n\nuptake on the concentration of external Pi was analysed by GraphPad Prism, \n\nversion 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using the following kinetic \n\nmodels: \n\nmax\n\nm\n   (1 saturating component)     (1) \n\n \n\n1\nmax\n\n1\nm\n\n2\nmax\n\n2\nm\n\n  (2 saturating component)   (2) \n\nwhere S is the substrate concentration (Pi), v the initial uptake rate, vmax the \n\nmaximal velocity and Km is the Michaelis\u2013Menten constant. The transport \n\nkinetics best fit was determined, and estimates for the parameters vmax and Km \n\nwere obtained. The application of the computer-assisted non-linear regression \n\nanalysis showed that experimental data displayed a better fit to the Eq. (2), \n\nindicating the involvement of a biphasic Pi uptake model, as suggested from the \n\ngraphical analysis of the Eadie\u2013Hofstee plot. Besides the low-affinity  \n\n(Km, 40.8 \u00b5M Pi; vmax, 3.5 \u00b5mol Pi h-1 g-1 FW) Pi transport component commonly \n\nfound in plants, another Pi transport system operating in the submicromolar \n\nrange (Km, 225 nM Pi; vmax, 0.22 \u00b5mol Pi h-1 g-1 FW) also became apparent. \n\nSimilar results were obtained in mature proteoid roots (not shown) suggesting \n\nthat Pi uptake characteristics do not change significantly with the root \n\ndevelopment. When H. sericea plants grown hydroponically in a 1 \u00b5M Pi \n\nnutrient solution were transferred to a 1 mM Pi nutrient solution for 2 days, a \n\nbiphasic kinetics was also revealed but the vmax of Pi transport in the low-affinity \n\nrange decreased by 50% (Fig 3.3.C). Pi transport experiments were also \n\nperformed in proteoid roots from wild-grown H. sericea. The initial velocities of \n\n0.2, 4 and 20 \u00b5MPi were 0.10, 1.04 and 1.97 \u00b5mol Pi h-1 g-1 FW, respectively, \n\n\n\n3.3 RESULTS \n\n~ 78 ~ \n\nsuggesting that Pi uptake characteristics did not differ too much from those of \n\nhydroponically-grown  plants. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 Transport of 32Pi, at pH 6.0, by proteoid roots of hydroponically-grown  \nH. sericea. \n\n(A) Time course of 1 \u00b5M 32Pi uptake and (B and C) initial uptake rates of 0.1\u2013150 \u00b5M 32Pi.

Results showed that the protonophore CCCP strongly inhibited the initial \n\nuptake rates of 0.1\u2013150 \u00b5M 32Pi, as shown in Table 3.1 for 2 \u00b5M 32Pi, \n\nsuggesting the involvement of energy mediated co-transport systems driven by \n\na proton gradient. Fig 3.4.A shows the effect of external pH on the initial uptake \n\nrates of 2 \u00b5M 32Pi by excised proteoid roots. Similar results were obtained with \n\n0.3 and 20 \u00b5M 32Pi (not shown). To achieve the same concentration of the \n\ntransported form throughout the pH range 4.5\u20136.5, total Pi concentrations were \n\nadjusted according to Henderson\u2013Hasselbach equation. Results showed that \n\nfrom pH 5.5 to 6.5 there was a reduction of about 50% on Pi transport capacity \n\ncorroborating the involvement of H+-dependent transport. To determine which Pi \n\nform is preferentially transported by proteoid roots of H. sericea, uptake \n\nexperiments depicted in Fig 3.3.B at pH 6.0 were also performed at pH 4.5, 5.5, \n\nand 6.5 and the new kinetic parameters evaluated. Because Km variation was \n\nlower when Pi concentration was expressed as [H2PO4-] through this pH range, \n\nthe results suggest that this anionic form is the substrate for Pi transport \n\nsystems of H. sericea, as it has been described for other plant species (Vance \n\net al., 2003; Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). To evaluate the effect of \n\nmembrane potential on Pi transport, the lipophilic and highly permeant cation \n\nTPP+ was used to dissipate electrical current across biological membrane. TPP+ \n\ninhibited Pi transport by 40% (Table 3.1), suggesting a net influx of positive \n\ncharges into the cells, implying that more than one proton is co-transported per \n\nH2PO4- molecule, at 2 \u00b5M Pi and pH 6.0. In fact, the stoichiometry of Pi uptake \n\nis not yet resolved, but calculations and experimental data suggest that two to \n\nfour protons are co-transported with each H2PO4- (Rausch and Bucher, 2002).  \n\n\n\n3.3 RESULTS \n\n~ 80 ~ \n\nTable 3.1 Effect of uncouplers, mercurial reagents and phosphate analogs on 2 \u00b5M Pi \nuptake, at pH 6.0, by proteoid roots of hydroponically-grown  H. sericea. \n\nInhibitor Inhibition (%) \n\nCCCP (0.1mM) 96 \n\nTPP+ (0.1 mM) 40 \n\nHgCl2 (0.1 mM) 67 \n\nMersalyl (0.25 mM) 30 \n\nPhosphite (0.1 mM) 85 \n\nArsenate (0.1 mM) 89 \n\nVanadate (0.1 mM) 1 \n\nPi transport of H. sericea was also sensitive to the inorganic mercuric \n\ncompound HgCl2 and to mersalyl, an organomercurial that modifies cysteine \n\nresidues (Table 3.1). Fig 3.4.B shows the dose-response effect of mersalyl on \n\nPi uptake. Maximal inhibition capacity was obtained with 250 \u00b5M mersalyl, a \n\nreduction by 30% on initial uptake rates of 2 \u00b5M Pi being achieved. \n\n3.3.3 Effect of the Pi analogs phosphite, arsenic and vanadate on Pi \nuptake \n\nPhosphite (Phi) has been described as an analog of Pi. However, there is no \n\nevidence suggesting that plants can utilize Phi as a sole source of P \n\n(Varadarajan et al., 2002). Arsenic is a non-essential element for plants whose \n\ninorganic species, such as arsenate and arsenite, are generally highly \n\nphytotoxic (Wang et al., 2002). As shown in Table 3.1, Phi and arsenate \n\ninhibited 32Pi uptake in H. sericea. In addition, competition experiments showed \n\nthat both compounds can be absorbed via Pi transporters in H. sericea proteoid \n\nroots. Fig 3.4.C shows the effect of 250 \u00b5M arsenate and Phi on 1\u201320 \u00b5M 32Pi \n\nuptake. Arsenate has been described as a strong competitive physiological \n\nanalog of phosphate in higher plants (Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1989).

Therefore, an alternative \n\nmechanism for vanadate uptake must exist in the plasma membrane for \n\nexplaining the inhibition of proton pumping in H. sericea. Since Pi uptake \n\nexperiments were performed under an artificially imposed transmembrane pH \n\ngradient, inhibition of proton pumping activity mediated by vanadate did not \n\nimpair 32Pi transport. In other plant species it was also shown that phosphate \n\ntransport is insensitive to vanadate and that other transporters are involved on \n\nits uptake (Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1989; Poder and Penot, 1992). In Lemna gibba \n\nvanadate uptake is mediated by a H+ co-transport mechanism and does not \n\ninterfere with phosphate uptake (Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1989). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.5 Concentration of P in tissues of H. sericea \n\nPhosphorus concentration in roots, stems and leaves of H. sericea plants grown in the wild, in a 1 \u00b5M Pi \nnutrient solution during 10 weeks (P-) and 1 \u00b5M Pi nutrient solution for a period of 10 weeks followed by \nincubation in a 1 \u00b5M Pi nutrient-poor solution for 2 days (P+).

In both \n\ncases, roots behaved as the preferential site for P storage. In contrast, 48 h \n\nafter the transfer of hydroponically-grown plants to a 1 mM Pi nutrient solution, \n\nplant P status increased dramatically. Roots capacity for P storage appears to \n\nhave been exceeded since the concentration of P in leaves increased \n\ndramatically to values where toxicity symptoms started to appear (not shown). \n\nThis increase in the leaf P status may also be due to a limitation of the \n\nrecirculation of shoot P via phloem. \n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA \n\n~ 85 ~ \n\n3.4 DISCUSSION \n\nIt has been described that low-Pi status in the soil is a major cause of proteoid \n\nroot formation (Neumann and Martinoia, 2002) that can be enhanced by N \n\ndeficiency (Dinkelaker et al., 1995; Sas et al., 2002). Accordingly, \n\nhydroponically-grown H. sericea developed proteoid roots with low-P, but not in \n\nP-rich media. Also, P and N availability was shown to be very low in the upper \n\nsoil layers of the sampling area where proteoid roots from wild-plants were \n\ncollected. \n\nIt has been difficult to demonstrate that the proteoid portion of the roots system \n\nis able to uptake Pi in a much higher extent than the non-proteoid portion in \n\nproteoid root-forming species. Roelofs et al., (2001) compared the uptake of Pi \n\nby proteoid and non-proteoid roots of H. prostrata by measuring the depletion of \n\n63, 124 and 151 \u00b5M KH2PO4 (initial concentrations) over 45 min by a \n\ncolorimetric method. Pi transport depended linearly on the external Pi \n\nconcentration, and uptake rates were of the same order of magnitude for both \n\ncluster and non-cluster roots, the latter being twice as high. Authors concluded \n\nthat results must be interpreted with caution due, for instance, to differences in \n\nthe morphology of both root types. Furthermore, Keerthisinghe et al., (1998) \n\nshowed for Lupinus albus that not only the rate of Pi uptake was similar for both \n\ncluster and non-cluster roots but also that the results may depend on the \n\nmethod and the manner of expression of the uptake rate. Nevertheless, \n\nNeumann et al., (1999, 2000) reported that 33Pi uptake per unit root fresh weight \n\nor per root surface area in P-deficient white lupin was approximately 2-fold \n\nhigher in root clusters compared to the apices of non-proteoid roots. In the \n\npresent work, autoradiographs with 32Pi of root system portions demonstrated \n\nthat the proteoid portions of the root system are the sites of a more effective Pi \n\nuptake in H. sericea. Although qualitative, this approach allowed the direct \n\ncomparison of Pi uptake by both root types. In addition, the intense acidification \n\nobserved in the vicinity of proteoid roots mediated by the plasma membrane  \n\nH+-ATPase suggests an increased capacity to mobilize Pi from the rhizosphere \n\n\n\n3.4 DISCUSSION \n\n~ 86 ~ \n\nby decreasing its interaction with inorganic surfaces in the soil and to energize \n\nPi transport systems. Both the increased Pi uptake and rhizosphere acidification \n\naround proteoid roots can result from the activity of a higher number of \n\ntransporter proteins due to the higher surface to volume ratio of proteoid roots \n\nwhen compared to non-proteoid portions of the root system. Therefore, the \n\nsystems responsible for Pi uptake by cluster roots may be similar to those used \n\nin non-cluster roots, as already described for other species (Lambers at al., \n\n2003), being the observed differences simply due to root morphology. \n\nPi uptake capacity did not change considerably along with proteoid root \n\ndevelopment of hydroponically-grown H. sericea. Juvenile and mature proteoid \n\nroots exhibit similar Pi uptake characteristics. In contrast, it has been described \n\nthat the exudation of compounds, such as organic acids and ectoenzymes, that \n\nchemically modify the surrounding soil in order to facilitate the mobilization of Pi, \n\nis a transient phenomenon (Watt and Evans, 1999; Neumann and Martinoia, \n\n2002; Lambers et al., 2003). Maintaining Pi uptake in older proteoid roots after \n\nthe pulse of root exudation could be a pre-requisite for uptake of mobilized Pi \n\nand thus for the function of cluster roots and has been similarly reported for  \n\nL. albus (Neumann et al., 1999). \n\nPi uptake by proteoid roots from hydroponically-grown H. sericea was shown to \n\nbe dependent on H+ gradient and yielded a biphasic kinetics suggesting the \n\ninvolvement of H+/Pi co-transport systems with distinct substrate affinities  \n\n(Km 225 nM and 40.8 \u00b5M). The establishment of the transmembrane proton \n\nelectrochemical potential is mediated by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase \n\n(Raghothama, 1999) whose activity can be modulated by P starvation  \n\n(Shen et al., 2006). In several different tissues and plant species estimates of \n\nthe Km for high-affinity uptake range from 3 to 7 \u00b5M, whereas for low-affinity \n\ntransporters the Km estimates are more variable, from 50 to 330 \u00b5M (Clarkson, \n\n1984; Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1984; McPharlin and Bieleski, 1987; Furihata et al., \n\n1992). The existence of biphasic high- and low-affinity Pi transport systems has \n\nbeen shown by molecular and/or biochemical methods not only for plant cells, \n\nbut also for bacteria (Rao and Torriani, 1990), mammals (Olah et al., 1994), \n\nyeast (Borst-Pauwels, 1981) and other fungi, including germ tubes of the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA \n\n~ 87 ~ \n\nendomycorrhizas (Thomson et al., 1990) and intact ectomycorrhizas (Beever \n\nand Burns, 1980; Colpaert et al., 1999). However, for mycorrhizas, Pi affinity \n\nappears to span a range of Km values often quite small compared to that of  \n\nnon-mycorrhizal roots, varying from Km of 1.6 (Cress et al., 1979) to 0.01 \u00b5M \n\n(Straker and Mitchell, 1987). Therefore, the very high affinity Pi transport \n\ncomponent found in H. sericea (Km 0.225 \u00b5M) suggests that proteoid roots can \n\nexpress a specific Pi transport system with the highest affinity characterized to \n\ndate in non-mycorrhizal roots. This Pi transport system operating in the \n\nsubmicromolar range is likely a key element for plant survival in soils with low-Pi \n\nlevels. \n\nIn terms of transport capacity (vmax), Pi uptake rates in H. sericea proteoid roots \n\nare similar to those measured in other plant species, including the proteoid \n\nroots of H. prostrata (Roelofs et al., 2001) and L. albus (Keerthisinghe et al., \n\n1998; Neumann et al., 1999), the dauciform roots of Schoenus unispiculatus \n\n(Shane et al., 2005), the non-specialized roots of Zea mays (Sentenac and \n\nGrignon, 1985; Fa\u00e7anha and Okorokova-Fa\u00e7anha, 2002) and L. gibba  \n\n(Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1981). However, it is difficult to compare results obtained \n\nfrom different plant species under different culture conditions using various \n\nexperimental approaches. \n\nIn spite of all published data, the mechanisms regulating and coordinating the \n\nexpression and activity of plant solute transporters are far from being well \n\nunderstood. The same protein can mediate dual-affinity uptake regulated post \n\ntranscriptionally by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, such as the case of the \n\nnitrate transporter CHL1, with a Km of 50 \u00b5M for the high affinity phase of uptake \n\nand 4 mM for the low-affinity phase (Liu et al., 1999; Liu and Tsay, 2003), or \n\nexhibit dual functions with spatially distinct domains for each function, such as \n\nthe case of TRP family of ion channels that uses an N-terminal domain for its \n\nchannel activity and a C-terminal domain for enzyme activity (Cahalan, 2001; \n\nPerraud et al., 2001). Also, the potassium channel gene AKT1 isolated in \n\nArabidopsis was found to be responsible for high affinity potassium uptake \n\n(Hirsch et al., 1998) and the potassium transporter AtKUP1 also functions as a \n\ndual-affinity transporter (Fu and Luan, 1999). The question of the existence of \n\n\n\n3.4 DISCUSSION \n\n~ 88 ~ \n\nseveral Pi transporters with different functional characteristics in plant cell \n\nmembranes or only one transporter with characteristics that vary with internal P \n\nstatus or external concentration has been addressed using kinetic analysis of \n\nuptake (Schachtman et al., 1998). However, recent advances in the molecular \n\nbiology of putative plasma membrane and tonoplast Pi transporters confirm that \n\nplants have multiple transporters for Pi. In Arabidopsis thaliana, nine  \n\nhigh-affinity Pi transporter genes have been identified and characterized \n\n(Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). At least three of these genes are \n\nexpressed in roots and are up-regulated by Pi starvation. Similarly, in potato \n\none gene was specifically induced in roots and stolons by starving the plants of \n\nPi, whereas a second gene was expressed throughout the plant under \n\nconditions of high or low phosphate (Schachtman et al., 1998; Raghothama, \n\n1999). \n\nTo study regulation of P-uptake in H. prostrate, Shane et al., (2003) cultivated \n\nplants with distinct P regimes and obtained an estimate of P uptake (by dividing \n\ntotal plant P by the mass of the root) as dependent on external P concentration \n\n(P uptake / [P]). In view of the fact that this value was about 3.5-fold higher \n\nwhen roots received 1 \u00b5M Pi than in plants with one root half immersed in a \n\nmedium with 1 \u00b5M Pi, and the other half immersed in 75 \u00b5M Pi, the authors \n\nconcluded that in H. prostrata Pi is able to down-regulate the P-uptake system. \n\nIn the present work, we studied 32Pi uptake by proteoid roots of in vitro \n\nH. sericea plants grown under Pi deficiency and in plants subject to high Pi \n\nconcentration for 48 h, the former exhibiting low-P status and the latter \n\ndisplaying high P concentration in roots, stems and leaves. As described for  \n\nH. prostrata, it appears that P concentration affects Pi transport negatively. \n\nHowever, Pi uptake in the high affinity range was apparently not sensitive to \n\nfluctuations on both external Pi availability and P status. This is in contrast to \n\nthe most common interpretation of the kinetic and molecular data available in \n\nplants suggesting that the activity of the high affinity Pi transport system is \n\neither increased or de-repressed by Pi starvation and the activity of the lower \n\naffinity transport system is constitutive (Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). In \n\nspite of the low-affinity Pi transport component had been reduced by 50% in  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA \n\n~ 89 ~ \n\nH. sericea plants subject to high Pi, the concentration of P in plant tissues \n\nincreased dramatically and plants started to exhibit foliar symptoms of P toxicity. \n\nHowever, since P in soil is more often in short supply than in excess, the \n\ninvasiveness capacity of H. sericea may be enhanced by the production of \n\nproteoid roots displaying high efficient Pi transport, although poorly  \n\ndown-regulated by P availability. \n\nBoth P status and Pi intake characteristics of wild-grown H. sericea plants did \n\nnot differ too much from the values found in hydroponically-grown plants \n\ncultivated in a medium with low-Pi, which correlates with the residual amounts \n\nof P found in the sampling area. Besides the substantial mobilization of Pi within \n\nthe activity period of typical mature proteoid roots (e.g. 10\u201350 \u00b5mol g-1 soil as \n\nreported by Dinkelaker et al., (1989), associated with the transient release of \n\ncarboxylates, pH changes and acid phosphatases, here we have shown that  \n\nH. sericea proteoid roots are also specialized sites for Pi uptake, a feature that \n\nmust confer adaptive advantages to the plant to invade Pi-impoverished soils. \n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 - PHOSPHATE TRANSPORT BY PROTEOID ROOTS OF HAKEA SERICEA \n\n~ 91 ~ \n\n3.5 REFERENCES \n\nBeever RE and Burns DJW, 1980.

Here we report the identification of four PhT genes \n\n(PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7) from Hakea sericea Schrad., an Australian \n\nProteaceae invader of natural habitats with enhanced ability to uptake Pi. The \n\nphylogenetic analysis and transmembrane domain (TMD) prediction of the \n\npartial sequences of all identified genes place them as members of PhT1 family. \n\nThese high- and low-affinity H+/Pi symporters, containing 12 TMDs in plasma \n\nmembranes, are involved in Pi uptake into the cell. Phylogenetic analysis of 55 \n\nPhTs from 13 dicot and monocot species confirms the high identity between all \n\nPhT1 proteins, placing PhT2 members - H+/Pi symporters expressed in the \n\nchloroplast - in a different cluster. Although Na+/Pi symport mechanisms have \n\nbeen almost exclusively described in bacteria, fungi and animals, we also report \n\nthe possible existence of a 10 TMD chloroplastidial Na+/Pi symporter family in \n\nplants. Through phylogenetic analysis it was also demonstrated that the \n\nexpression site of each PhT1 cannot be correlated with its deduced amino acid \n\nsequence and therefore be inferred based on its structural basis only. \n\nTo better understand the Pi transport regulation mechanism of H. sericea it \n\nwould be necessary not only to complete the sequencing of PiT2, PiT6, PH5 \n\nand PH7, but also to study the expression patterns of these genes in plants \n\nunder high- or low-Pi availability. \n\nManuscript in preparation. \n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 101 ~ \n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nThe phosphate transporters (PhT) belong to the major facilitator superfamily \n\n(MFS) that is present in all biological cells. This large and diverse family of \n\nproteins is involved in the transport of sugars, antibiotics, ions and amino acids \n\n(Pao et al., 1998; Law et al., 2008). PhT comprise different subfamilies that are \n\nresponsible not only for the uptake of phosphate (Pi) from soil to root, but also \n\nfor its translocation to other parts of the plant or its interorganellar allocation \n\n(Rausch and Bucher, 2002). The PhT1 proteins are mainly found in plasma \n\nmembranes, suggesting an important role in Pi uptake into the cell. However, \n\nbesides being uptaken into the cytoplasm, Pi must also be transported between \n\norganelles (Mimura, 1999). For example, Pi involvement in \n\nphotophosphorylation as well as in the partitioning of triose phosphates renders \n\nessential its presence in the chloroplast (Versaw and Harrison, 2002). Pi import \n\ninto the chloroplast may occur via triose-phosphate/phosphate translocator \n\n(TPT), in a counter-exchange of stromal triose phosphates generated from CO2 \n\nfixation with cytosolic Pi (Walters et al., 2004). However, due to the \n\nstoichiometric ratio of this process, plants must rely on alternative mechanisms \n\nfor concentrating Pi in the chloroplast. This role is played by PhT2 protein \n\ntransporters. Although several works performed with green algae reported that \n\nNa+ could have a stimulatory effect on Pi uptake (Ullrich and Glaser, 1982; \n\nRaven, 1984), until the beginning of this decade it was widely accepted that \n\nNa+/Pi symporters were exclusively found in bacteria, fungi and animals (Mann \n\net al., 1989; Bun-Ya et al., 1991; Martinez and Persson, 1998; Werner and \n\nKinne, 2001). Reid et al. (2000) elegantly showed that the green algae Chara \n\ncorallina also relies on a high-affinity Na+/Pi symporter for Pi uptake. In addition, \n\nRubio et al. (2005) proposed the presence of a Na+/Pi symporter in Zostera \n\nmarina, a submerged aquatic angiosperm able to uptake Pi both by leaves and \n\nroots (P\u00e9rez-Llor\u00e9ns and Niell, 1995). According to the authors a high-affinity \n\nNa+/Pi coupled transport system operating in the epidermal root cells of  \n\nZ. marina is induced upon 8 days following Pi starvation. More recently, Gao  \n\n\n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION \n\n~ 102 ~ \n\net al. (2006) have identified a Na+/Pi transporter gene from Thellungiella \n\nhalophila, whose protein seems to have a long N-terminal extension that \n\nfunctions as a chloroplastidial transit peptide. \n\nPhT1 proteins contains between 518 and 587 amino acid residues, which are \n\narranged in two groups of six transmembranar domains that are connected by a \n\nlarge hydrophilic charged region containing 60 amino acids (Fig 4.1) \n\n(Schachtman et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2000; Vance et al., 2003; Raghothama \n\nand Karthikeyan, 2005). The similarity between the first and the second half of \n\nthe protein suggests that Pi transporters have evolved by a tandem intragenic \n\nduplication of the original structural unit of a six membrane-spanning protein \n\n(Pao et al., 1998; Raghothama and Karthikeyan, 2005). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Diagram of the typical structure \nof a PhT1 protein.  \n\nTwelve membrane spanning regions are separated \ninto two groups of six by a large hydrophilic \ncharged region. \n\n \nThe importance of Pi in so many cellular processes requires a highly regulated \n\nPi uptake into the cell and interorganellar transport (Ticconi and Abel, 2004). Pi \n\nflux between chloroplasts, mitochondria, vacuoles and cytoplasm is primarily \n\nmediated by continuously expressed low-affinity PhTs (Mimura, 1999; Rausch \n\nand Bucher, 2002). However, the mobilization of this nutrient within plants under \n\nPi deficiency mainly relies on induced high-affinity PhTs (Karthikeyan et al., \n\n2002; Mudge et al., 2002). Physiological studies regarding Pi uptake from soil to \n\nroots have suggested a dual uptake model involving both the high- and  \n\nlow-affinity systems (Ullrich-Eberius et al., 1984; Sentenac and Grignon, 1985; \n\nAmijee et al., 1991). These results were corroborated by the presence of \n\ntranscripts and proteins of both systems in root epidermal and root hair cells \n\n(Daram et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998; Chiou et al., 2001). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 103 ~ \n\nThe identification and characterization of 9 high-affinity PhTs in Arabidopsis \n\nthaliana and 13 high- and low-affinity PhTs in Oryza sativa suggests the \n\npresence of a small family of high-affinity PhTs in plants (Karthikeyan et al., \n\n2002; Mudge et al., 2002). Many of the corresponding genes are mainly \n\nexpressed in roots, only under low internal Pi status, reflecting the attempt of \n\nplants to counteract Pi deficiency. In contrast, when internal Pi status is high, \n\nthe expression of these genes is low as well as the amount of the resultant PhT \n\nprotein (Muchhal et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1997; Dong et al., 1999). When \n\ngrowing under Pi-deficiency, cluster roots forming species display a reduction \n\non the apparent Km for Pi uptake. For example, in Lupinus albus the Km \n\ndecreases from 30.7 ?M to 8.6 ?M, whereas uptake of Pi on a gram fresh \n\nweight basis is greatly increased (Keerthisinghe et al., 1998; Neumann et al., \n\n1999). This enhancement of Pi uptake was suggested to be related with the \n\nexpression of a novel high-affinity Pi uptake system, LaPT1 (Liu et al., 2001). \n\nHakea sericea Schrad., an Australian Proteaceae, also relies on proteoid roots \n\nfor enhanced Pi uptake. Under low Pi availability, the Km for the high-affinity Pi \n\nuptake system can reach the sub-micromolar range (225 nM Pi) (Sousa et al., \n\n2007). However, in contrast to what has been described for A. thaliana,  \n\nH. sericea seems unable to consistently down-regulate its high-affinity Pi uptake \n\nsystem under Pi excess. Consequently, Pi levels within stems and leaves of \n\nplants growing in these conditions increased more than 10-fold and phosphate \n\ntoxicity symptoms were observed in leaves (Sousa et al., 2007; refer to  \n\nChapter 3). \n\nAt present, studies regarding the characterization of PhT coding genes, not only \n\nfor H. sericea but also for all Hakea genus, are inexistent. The aim of our work \n\nis to find and characterize PhT coding genes in H. sericea and correlate them \n\nwith PhT proteins from other plant species. The expression analysis of the \n\nidentified genes would allow to understand in detail the Pi transport regulation in \n\nthis plant species. The expression analysis of the identified genes would allow \n\nthe understanding the Pi transport regulation in this plant species, which is able \n\nto cope with nutrient-poor soils. \n\n\n\n4.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n~ 104 ~ \n\n4.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n4.2.1 Plant material \n\nHakea sericea plants were grown hydroponically in vessels containing 8 L of \n\nmineral medium with 200 \u00b5M Ca(NO3)2, 100 \u00b5M MgSO4, 330 \u00b5M KNO3, 50 \u00b5M \n\nNH4NO3, 18 \u00b5M H3BO3, 8 \u00b5M MnSO4, 0.16 \u00b5M CuSO4, 0.32 \u00b5M ZnSO4, 0.4 \u00b5M \n\nNa2MoO4, 20 \u00b5M FeEDTA, 100 \u00b5M NaH2PO4, at pH 5.8. Up to 8 plants shared \n\nthe same 8-L container and nutrient solution was biweekly replaced. The \n\nhydroponic system was kept under a photoperiod of 16 h, at 25\u00baC, with a \n\nquantum irradiance of 200 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1. \n\n4.2.2 Genomic DNA extraction \n\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) purification was performed using a modification of the \n\nmethod described by Mason and Schmidt (2002). \n\nH. sericea leaves from 6-weeks-old plants were collected, frozen in liquid \n\nnitrogen and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. Approximately \n\n2 g of fresh weigh was added to 10 mL of preheated (60\u00baC) extraction buffer \n\n[2% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 (PVP-40), 0.2 M Tris  \n\n, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 2% (v/v) ?-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0]. The mixture \n\nwas incubated at 60\u00baC for 30 min, with occasional swirling. One volume of \n\nchloroform-isoamyl alcohol [24:1 (v/v)] was added to the solution, mixed for \n\n5 min and centrifuged at 7500 g for 10 min, at 10\u00b0C. For carbohydrates \n\nremoval, 0.25 volumes of pure ethanol were added to the aqueous layer, and \n\nthe solution was extracted twice in one volume of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol \n\n[24:1 (v/v)]. Total nucleic acids were precipitated with two volumes of ethanol \n\nand collected without centrifugation by carefully pouring off the supernatant. \n\nAfter transferring to a 1.5 mL microtube, nucleic acids were pelleted at 14000 g \n\nfor 10 min, at 4\u00b0C, and resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of water. Total RNA was \n\ndigested by incubation with 50 \u00b5g RNase A, at 37\u00b0C, for 1.5 h. RNase A and \n\nother contaminating proteins were removed by addition of one volume of \n\nchloroform-isoamyl alcohol [24:1 (v/v)], mixing for 5 min, and centrifugation at \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 105 ~ \n\n14000 g for 5 min. The aqueous phase was retained, and genomic DNA was \n\nprecipitated by adding two volumes of ethanol and 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium \n\nacetate (pH 5.2) followed by overnight incubation at 4\u00baC. The sample was \n\ncentrifuged for 10 min at 14000 g and 4\u00baC. The pellet was briefly washed with \n\n70% (v/v) ethanol and air-dried for 5 min. After resuspension in 50 \u00b5L TE buffer \n\n[10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA], gDNA was stored at 4\u00baC. Quantification \n\nand purity evaluation of gDNA solution was determined as described in Annex I. \n\n4.2.3 Amplification of phosphate transporter genes by PCR \n\nThermocyclic amplification of phosphate transporter genes present of H. sericea \n\ngenome was carried out using degenerated primers (PiF1 and PiR1). PiF1 and \n\nPiR1 were designed based on conserved regions of plant phosphate transporter \n\ngenes, as determined by the multiple sequence alignment of homologous \n\ngenes. PiF1 and PiR1 design followed several parameters as suggested by \n\nGriffin and Griffin (1994). Both primers were 20 bases long, the G/C content \n\nwas maintained between 45%-55%, the melting temperatures (Tm) were as \n\nsimilar as possible, and the corresponding annealing sites were separated by \n\n437 bp. The redundancy of the degenerated primers, referred to as the possible \n\ncombinations of synthesized oligonucleotides sequences, was kept low (128\u00d7) \n\nand synthesis was performed by MWG. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was \n\nperformed using the PureTaq\u2122 Ready-to-Go\u2122 PCR Beads (GE Healthcare), \n\naccording to the supplier\u2019s instructions. For each PCR, 25 pmol of each primer \n\n(PiF1 and PiR1) and 50 ng of gDNA were used. The final concentration of each \n\ndNTP was 200 \u00b5M in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at room temperature), 50 mM KCl \n\nand 1.5 mM MgCl2. Sterile ultrapure water was added up to a final volume of \n\n25 \u00b5L. Tubes were gently flicked with a finger, and components were brought \n\nback to the bottom of the tube with a few seconds centrifugation. PCR \n\namplification was carried out on a Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf) with an \n\nannealing temperature gradient. PCR steps were as follows: (1) denaturation for \n\n5 min at 94\u00b0C; (2) 35 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94\u00b0C, annealing for \n\n1 min at 40.0\u00baC, 45.2\u00baC, 50.5\u00baC or 55.8\u00baC, polymerization for 1 min at 72\u00b0C;  \n\n\n\n4.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n~ 106 ~ \n\n(3) extension for 10 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR products were resolved by agarose \n\nelectrophoresis as described in Annex I.  \n\n4.2.4 Cloning of PCR fragments into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector \n\nDNA fragments used for cloning were recovered from agarose gels using the \n\nGFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (Amersham). A maximum of \n\n300 mg of agarose gel, containing the DNA fragment of interest, were sliced in \n\nsmall pieces and placed in a microcentrifuge tube. An equal volume \n\n(1 mg = 1 ?L) of capture buffer was added. After vortexing vigorously, the \n\nmixture was incubated at 60\u00baC until the agarose gel was completely dissolved \n\n(~10 min). The sample was loaded onto a GFX column previously placed in a \n\ncollection tube and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Following a \n\ncentrifugation at 8000 g for 30 s, the flow-through was discarded. The GFX \n\ncolumn was washed by loading 500 ?L of washing buffer, followed by a \n\ncentrifugation at 8000 g for 30 s. DNA elution was promoted by applying 50 ?L \n\nof sterile ultra pure water, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 min \n\nand centrifugation at 8000 g for 1 min. \n\nDNA fragments were cloned onto the pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) cloning vector \n\n(Stratagene), an expression vector suited to efficiently clone blunt-ended PCR \n\nproducts. As Taq DNA polymerase amplifies fragments leaving A (adenine) \n\noverhangs, a polishing reaction was set up using 10 ?L of the purified PCR \n\nproduct, 1 ?L of 10 mM dNTP mix (2.5 mM each), 1.3 ?L of 10\u00d7 polishing buffer \n\nand 1 ?L of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (0.5 U) (Stratagene). The polishing \n\nreaction was mixed gently and incubated at 72\u00baC for 30 min. The ligation \n\nreaction was set up using 1 ?L of the pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) cloning vector \n\n(10 ng/?L), 4 ?L of the blunt-ended PCR product, 1 ?L of PCR-Script 10\u00d7 \n\nreaction buffer, 0.5 ?L of 10 mM ATP, 1 ?L of Srf I restriction enzyme (5 U/?L) \n\n(Roche), 1 ?L of T4 DNA ligase (4 U/?L) and sterile ultrapure water up to a final \n\nvolume of 10 ?L. The ligation reaction was mixed gently and allowed to proceed \n\nat room temperature for 1 h before heat treating at 65\u00b0C for 10 min. An aliquot \n\nof the ligation reaction (2 ?L) was used to transform E. coli JM109 cells followed \n\nby cell plating onto selective LB-Amp plates [1% (w/v) bacto-tryptone, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 107 ~ \n\n0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) NaCl, 100 ?g.mL-1 ampicillin, pH 7.0] \n\ncontaining X-gal (40 ?g.mL-1) and IPTG (40 ?g.mL-1) for recombinant selection. \n\n4.2.5 gDNA library preparation \n\nH. sericea gDNA library preparation was performed according to standard \n\nprocedures (Ausubel et al., 1996), following the instructions provided with the \n\nLambda DASH\u00ae II/BamH I Vector Kit (Stratagene).  \n\nPreparation of genomic fragments to be cloned  \n\nPreparation of the gDNA library requires 20 kb DNA fragments. Pilot digestions \n\n(15 \u00b5L each) of gDNA were performed with 9 different concentrations of  \n\nSau3A I (Roche), ranging from 0.025 to 1x10-5 U.?g-1 of gDNA, for 1 h at 37\u00baC \n\n(refer to Annex 1). DNA fragments resulting from each reaction were analyzed \n\nby electrophoretic separation [0.5% (w/v) agarose, refer to Annex 1]. After \n\ndetermining the Sau3A I concentration at which 20 kb DNA fragments were \n\npredominantly obtained, 5 large scale digestions (500 \u00b5L each) were carried out \n\nusing the optimized conditions and 100 ?g of gDNA each. Digested DNA \n\nfragments were extracted twice in one volume of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol \n\n[24:1 (v/v)] and precipitated with two volumes of ethanol at -20\u00baC during \n\novernight. After centrifugation at 14000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, DNA was \n\nresuspended in 200 \u00b5L of water. DNA fragments were subsequently fractioned \n\nby centrifugation in continuous sucrose gradient. Sucrose gradient was \n\nproduced in 30 mL tubes with a gradient generator, using 10% (w/v) and \n\n40% (w/v) sucrose solutions prepared in gradient buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl \n\n(pH 8.0), 1 M NaCl and 5 mM EDTA]. After being incubated at 65\u00baC for 5 min, \n\nDNA samples were applied to the top of the gradient and centrifuged at 12000 g \n\nfor 20 h at 4\u00baC. The gradient was fractionated in 1 mL samples, collected from \n\nthe bottom. After electrophoretic analysis [0.5% (w/v) agarose, refer to \n\nAnnex 1], fractions containing 20 kb DNA fragments were precipitated with two \n\nvolumes of ethanol at -20\u00baC, during overnight. DNA was recovered by \n\ncentrifugation at 14000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of \n\n\n\n4.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n~ 108 ~ \n\nultrapure water. Quantification and purity evaluation of DNA solution was \n\ndetermined as described in Annex I. \n\nCloning of genomic fragments and library packaging  \n\nThe ligation of inserts to Lambda DASH\u00ae II vector (Stratagene) was performed \n\nusing 0.4 ?g of H. sericea gDNA fragments, 1 ?g of lambda vector, 0.5 ?L of \n\n10\u00d7 ligase buffer [500 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 70 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT], \n\n0.5 ?L of 10 mM ATP and 2 U of T4 DNA ligase (Roche) up to a final volume of \n\n5 ?L. The mixture was incubated at 4\u00baC, during overnight. \n\nThe lambda packaging extracts (Gigapack\u00ae III Packaging Extract, Stratagene) \n\nwere removed from -80\u00baC and quickly thawed. The volume of ligation reaction \n\nmixture, corresponding to 1.0 ?g of DNA, was immediately added to the \n\npackaging extract and gently mixed. The packaging mixture was then incubated \n\nat 22\u00baC for 2 h, followed by addition of 500 ?L of SM buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl \n\n(pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) gelatine] and 20 ?L \n\nof chloroform. The suspension was mixed and briefly centrifuged to sediment \n\ndebris. \n\nTitering the genomic library \n\nA single colony of E. coli XL1-Blue MRF\u2019 strain (Jerpseth et al., 1992) was used \n\nto inoculate 500 mL of LB [1% (w/v) bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, \n\n1% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.0], supplemented with 10 mM MgSO4 and 0.2% (w/v) \n\nmaltose. Growth was promoted by incubation at 30\u00baC with shaking (200 rpm), \n\nduring overnight. The bacteria were sedimented by centrifugation at 500 g for \n\n10 min, and resuspended in half the original volume with sterile 10 mM MgSO4. \n\nCells were further diluted to an A600 = 0.5 with sterile 10 mM MgSO4. \n\nFor titering the phage solution, 10-fold dilutions (10-1 to 10-3) of the packaged \n\nreaction were prepared in SM buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, \n\n10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) gelatine], and 1 ?L of each dilution was \n\nadded to 200 ?L of XL1-Blue MRF\u2019 host cells. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for \n\n15 min, 3 mL of melted Top Agarose NZY medium [0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, \n\n1% (w/v) NZ amine (casein hydrolysate), 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 109 ~ \n\nMgSO4.7H2O, 0.7% (w/v) agarose, pH 7.5] were added to the phage-cell \n\nsuspension. After mixing, the suspension was quickly poured onto the NZY agar \n\nplates [0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) NZ amine (casein hydrolysate), \n\n0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) MgSO4.7H2O, 1.5% (w/v) agar, pH 7.5] and \n\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The titer was determined by counting the number of \n\nphage plaques. \n\nAmplification of the genomic library \n\nThe gDNA library was amplified by separately combine 20 aliquots of the \n\npackaged library suspension, each containing 5x104 pfu, with 600 ?L of   \n\nXL1-Blue MRF\u2019 cells prepared as previously described. After incubation at 37\u00baC \n\nfor 15 min, 6.5 mL of melted Top Agarose NZY medium [0.5% (w/v) yeast \n\nextract, 1% (w/v) NZ amine (casein hydrolysate), 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) \n\nMgSO4.7H2O, 0.7% (w/v) agarose, pH 7.5] were added. The mixture was \n\nquickly poured onto the NZY agar medium [0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) \n\nNZ amine (casein hydrolysate), 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) MgSO4.7H2O, \n\n1.5% (w/v) agar, pH 7.5] (150-mm plates) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. Plates \n\nwere overlaid with 8 mL of SM buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, \n\n10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) gelatine]. For promoting the diffusion of \n\nphage into the SM buffer, an overnight incubation with gentle agitation was \n\nperformed at 4\u00baC. The bacteriophage suspension recovered from all the plates \n\nwas pooled together and chloroform to a 5% (v/v) final concentration was \n\nadded. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 500 g. After \n\nrecovering the supernatant, chloroform was added to a 0.3% (v/v) final \n\nconcentration and the suspension was stored at 4\u00baC. Long term storage was \n\nmade at -80\u00baC using aliquots of the amplified library in 7% (v/v) DMSO. Before \n\nusing the genomic library, the titer was determined using 10-fold serial dilutions \n\nand XL1-Blue MRF\u2019 host cells, as previously described. \n\n\n\n4.2 MATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n~ 110 ~ \n\n4.2.6 gDNA library screening \n\nAmplified H. sericea DNA fragments coding for phosphate transporters (section \n\n4.2.3) were used as homologous probes for the screening of H. sericea gDNA \n\nlibrary.  \n\nThe gDNA library was plated onto 150-mm NZY agar plates, as described in \n\nsection 4.2.5 (Amplification of genomic library), but using a density of 25000 \n\nplaques per plate. Inoculated plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12 h, followed \n\nby further incubation at 4\u00baC for 2 h. Phage particles were transferred from \n\nplaques to duplicate nylon filter discs (Hybond-N+; Amersham). The first disc \n\nwas placed onto each NZY agar plate for 2 min, while the replica disc was \n\nplaced for 4 min, to allow the transfer of phage particles to the membrane. \n\nRelease of DNA from the phage particle was promoted by incubating the \n\nmembrane in denaturation solution (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH) for 2 min. Plaque \n\nlifts were then transferred to the neutralization solution [0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), \n\n1.5 M NaCl] for 5 min, rinsed in washing solution [0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); \n\n30 mM Na citrate (pH 7.0); 0.3 M NaCl] for 30 seconds and air dried on \n\nWhatman\u00ae 3MM paper. DNA was crosslinked to the membranes by UV light in \n\na Stratalinker\u00ae UV crosslinker (Model 1800, Stratagene) using the autocrosslink \n\nsetting (1200 mJ). The hybridization proceeded as described in Annex 1. \n\nThe phage plaques responsible for coincident positive signals in both lifts were \n\nremoved from the NZY agar plate and resuspended in 500 ?L of SM buffer \n\n[50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) \n\ngelatine] containing 20 ?L of chloroform. After vortexing, lambda phages were \n\nre-plated at low density in NZY agar medium, using the same conditions as \n\npreviously referred (section 4.2.5, Titering the genomic library), but incubating \n\nthe plates at 37\u00b0C for 12 h, followed by further incubation at 4\u00baC for 2 h. For the \n\nsecond screening, Hybond-N (Amersham) nylon filter discs were used, but no \n\nduplicates were performed. Positive individualized clones were recovered from \n\nthe agar plates, resuspended in 500 ?L of SM buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), \n\n100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4.7H2O; 0.01% (w/v) gelatine] containing 20 ?L of \n\nchloroform and vortexed. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 111 ~ \n\n4.2.7 DNA recovery from lambda phages \n\nDNA recovery from lambda phages was performed using the Lambda Kit \n\n(Qiagen). Briefly, 250 ?L of the isolated single-clone lambda phage suspension \n\n(section 4.2.6) were combined with 200 ?L of XL1-Blue MRF\u2019 cells, prepared as \n\nreferred in section 4.2.5 (Titering the genomic library), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for \n\n15 min. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, 3 mL of NZY medium [0.5% (w/v) \n\nyeast extract, 1% (w/v) NZ amine (casein hydrolysate), 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% \n\n(w/v) MgSO4.7H2O, pH 7.5] were added and the suspension was incubated at \n\n37\u00baC, during overnight, with agitation. Following the addition of 2% (v/v) \n\nchloroform, the incubation at 37\u00b0C was allowed to proceed for further 15 min to \n\nenhance lysis efficiency. The phage suspension was centrifuged at 12000 g for \n\n10 min to remove bacterial debris. After adding 10 \u00b5L of Buffer L1 [300 mM \n\nNaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 0.2 mg.mL-1 BSA, 20 mg.mL-1 \n\nRNase A, 6 mg.mL-1 DNase I] to 3 mL of the supernatant, an incubation at 37\u00baC \n\nfor 30 min was performed for bacterial DNA and RNA removal. Following the \n\naddition of 700 \u00b5L of ice-cold buffer L2 [30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol \n\n(PEG 6000), 3 M NaCl], the solution was incubated on ice for 60 min to promote \n\nphage precipitation. After centrifugation at 12000 g for 10 min, the pellet was \n\nresuspended in 1 mL of buffer L3 [100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), \n\n25 mM EDTA]. \n\nTo allow denaturation of phage proteins and release of DNA, phage suspension \n\nwas gently mixed with 1 mL of buffer L4 [4% (w/v) SDS] and incubated at 70\u00baC \n\nfor 10 min.

Database search for nucleotide and \n\nprotein sequences was performed at the NCBI website using Entrez \n\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/index.html). The database search for highly \n\nsimilar sequences was carried out using the BLAST algorithm (Altschul et al., \n\n1997; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Nucleotide editing and analysis was \n\nperformed using the sequence analysis software from DNASTAR (Lasergene). \n\nWithin the software package, EditSeq was used to edit sequences and multiple \n\nsequence alignments were generated with MegAlign, using the ClustalW \n\nalgorithm (Jeanmougin et al., 1998). The unrooted phylogenetic tree, based on \n\nthe alignment of plant Pi transporter genes, was constructed using FigTree \n\n1.2.2 (freeware). The maximum likelihood method (Doyle and Gaut, 2000) was \n\nused to resolve the phylogenetic relationship between the newly identified  \n\nH. sericea Pi transporter genes and those from other plant species. \n\nThe analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana Pi transporter genes expression was \n\nperformed using eFP Browser (Winter et al., 2007; http://bar.utoronto.ca/efp/cgi-\n\nbin/efpWeb.cgi). \n\nPrediction of transmembrane domains was carried out using the TMHMM \n\nserver version 2.0 (Sonnhammer et al., 1998; http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ \n\nTMHMM). All predictions were performed using standard settings. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 113 ~ \n\n4.3 RESULTS \n\n4.3.1 Search for genes encoding PhTs in Hakea sericea genome \n\nIn order to identify genes encoding PhTs in H. sericea, two different approaches \n\nwere attempted. Using H. sericea genomic DNA as template, DNA fragments \n\nfrom H. sericea PhT genes were amplified using degenerated primers. The \n\namplified fragments were subsequently used as probes for screening other PhT \n\ngenes in a gDNA library of H. sericea. \n\nThe amplification of PhT gene fragments in H. sericea genome was carried out \n\nusing degenerated primers (PiF1 and PiR1). For their design, the conserved \n\nregions of higher plant H+/Pi symporters encoding genes were used, as \n\ndetermined by the multiple sequence alignment of homologous genes (Fig 4.2) \n\nThe electrophoretic analysis of the reaction products showed the amplification \n\nof fragments with the expected molecular weight of 437 bp in all tested \n\nannealing temperatures (Fig 4.3.A). When performing the amplification using \n\nthe annealing temperature of 40\u00baC, besides the 437 bp fragments, other \n\nunspecific amplified products with different molecular weights were observed. \n\nHowever, subsequent Southern blot analysis using as [?-32P]dCTP labeled \n\nprobe a LaPT1 gene fragment from Lupinus albus showed that only the 437 bp \n\nfragments hybridized with LaPT1 (Fig 4.3.B). Therefore, these fragments will be \n\nfurther referred to as PiT fragments. \n\nAfter being purified from the gel, the PiT fragments from the PCR amplification \n\nusing 55\u00b0C as annealing temperature were cloned into the pPCR-Script Amp \n\nSK(+) vector. Since fragments from different PhT genes could have been \n\nsimultaneously amplified, six recombinant plasmids were isolated, purified and \n\ndigested with EcoRI/SacI. The restriction fragments were analyzed by \n\nelectrophoresis and Southern blot analysis (Fig 4.4). Two different restriction \n\npatterns were detected, indicating the amplification of fragments from at least \n\ntwo different PhT genes during PCR [(PiT2, PiT4 and PiT5) and (PiT1, PiT3 and \n\nPiT6)]. PiT2 and PiT6 fragments were then completely sequenced (Fig 4.5). \n\n\n\n4.3 RESULTS \n\n~ 114 ~ \n\n.  \n\nFigure 4.2 Amino acid sequence alignment of higher plant H+/Pi symporters.  \n\nThe residues conserved among the majority of the sequences are shadowed in gray, and those conserved \nin all sequences are shadowed in black.

The multiple alignment of aminoacidic sequences was performed \n\nusing the ClustalW method and an unrooted tree was plotted using the \n\nmaximum-likelihood algorithm (Fig 4.10). Analysed proteins belong to three \n\ndistinct subfamilies of Pi transporters: PhT1, which includes high- and low-\n\naffinity H+/Pi symporters presumed to be targeted to the plasma membrane; \n\nPhT2, a family of low-affinity H+/Pi symporters expressed in chloroplasts; and a \n\nhypothetical Na+/Pi symporters family. Moreover, the PhT1 family was further \n\nsubdivided in two major clusters, comprising monocot or dicot proteins. The \n\norgan in which PhT proteins are mainly expressed is also represented in the \n\nphylogenetic tree (Fig 4.10). \n\nThe phylogenetic relations between PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 were also \n\nanalysed (Fig 4.11). As their incomplete deduced aminoacid sequences \n\nimpaired direct comparison with PhTs from other species, the 55 PhT \n\nsequences were trimmed before alignment to include only the same region as \n\nH. sericea sequences. As in Fig 4.10, results primarily showed an out-group \n\ncomposed by PhT2 members. The hypothetical Na+/Pi symporters also \n\nclustered together, but shared their branch with some PhT1 members. \n\nRegarding H. sericea PhTs, PiT2 clustered with a Pi transporter expressed \n\nmainly in flowers and pollen of Arabidopsis thaliana (At5G43340). PiT6 was \n\nincluded in the cluster in which the Na+/Pi symporters were included, together \n\nwith other dicot PhT1 members: two A. thaliana proteins (At1G20860 and \n\nAt1G76430) and a PhT1 member expressed in the roots of Medicago truncatula \n\n(MtPT1;4). Finally, PH5 and PH7 clustered together with PhT1 members from \n\nthe dicots A. thaliana, M. truncatula and L. albus, which are mostly expressed in \n\nroots (At5G43350, At5G43360, At5G43370 and LaPT1;2), senescent leaves \n\n(At2G32830) or in a location yet to study (MtPT1;6).

For the hypothetical Na+/Pi symporters, \n\nTMHMM v2 algorithm predicted 10 membrane spanning domains and a long \n\nhydrophilic N terminus (Fig 4.12.B). PhT1 members, regardless of their main \n\nexpression site, typically present 12 membrane spanning domains as PhT2 \n\nproteins, but being divided into two groups of 6 each (Fig 4.12.C). Both groups \n\nare connected by a large hydrophilic charged region, between TMD6 and \n\nTMD7, containing 60 amino acids.

It is generally acquired by epidermal cells at the root-soil interface \n\nand distributed to the aerial parts of the plant through its secretion into the \n\nxylem sap. During Pi shortage or senescence, this nutrient can eventually be \n\ncycled through the plant via the phloem (Daram, 1999; Mimura, 1999; \n\nRaghothama, 1999). It is commonly accepted that both processes occur at the \n\nplasma membrane through the activity of high- and low-affinity H+/Pi symporters \n\nfrom the PhT1 subfamily (Lefebvre and Clarkson, 1984; Ullrich-Eberius et al., \n\n1984; Mimura, 1999; Rausch and Bucher, 2002). The computational modelling \n\nof PhT1 proteins secondary structure predicted a six-loop-six structure, \n\ncontaining 12 TMDs with a large hydrophilic loop between TMD6 and TMD7.  \n\nAlso PhT2 transporters contain 12 TMDs, but in opposition to PhT1 members, \n\nthese Pi transporters present a large hydrophilic loop between TMD8 and TMD9 \n\nand a long N-terminal extension that functions as a transit peptide, directing the \n\nprotein to the chloroplast (Walters et al., 2004). The hypothetical Na+/Pi \n\ntransporters have 10 TMDs and a long N-terminal chloroplastidial transit peptide \n\n(Gao et al., 2006). \n\nThe phylogenetic analysis of 55 PhTs distributed across 13 plant species \n\nshowed that all analyzed PhT1 members are included in the same cluster, \n\nforming two subgroups composed by either dicot or monocot proteins. The high \n\nsimilarity of PhT1 proteins with each other as well as with the yeast PHO84 \n\nphosphate transporter (Saccharomyces cereviseae) and the fungi GvPT \n\nphosphate transporter (Glomus versiforme) (Bun-Ya et al., 1991; Harrison and \n\nvan Buuren, 1995; Leggewie et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1997) suggests that H+/Pi \n\nsymport is a highly conserved and widespread mechanism in plants and fungi. \n\nTaking into account that PhT1 and other individual MFS families diverged from \n\neach other long before eukarya and archaea diverged from bacteria, it is \n\nexpected that members of this subfamily should be present in other taxa \n\nbesides those from plants or fungi (Pao et al., 1998). In what concerns the PhT2 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 125 ~ \n\nmembers, all have clustered together and do not share homology with the PhT1 \n\nfamily. In fact, plant PhT2 members share more identity with Pi transporters \n\nfrom bacteria, Caenorhabditis elegans and the Na+/Pi symporters from both \n\nmammals and fungi than with plant PhT1 members (Mann et al., 1989; Martinez \n\nand Persson, 1998; Rausch and Bucher, 2002). Still, functional analysis \n\nindicates that PhT2 are low-affinity H+/Pi symporters (Daram et al., 1999; \n\nRausch and Bucher, 2002). The phylogenetic analysis also suggests the \n\nexistence of a new chloroplastidial Na+/Pi transporter family with orthologs in \n\nboth dicot (A. thaliana) and monocot (Oryza sativa). The identification of this \n\nnew putative PhT family suggests that plants also rely on Na+/Pi transporters. \n\nThis transport mechanism could be particularly useful in halophytes or in plants \n\nliving in alkaline media, where high Na+ concentrations could be used for \n\nenergization of anion transport (Rausch and Bucher, 2002). \n\nIn this work, four Hakea sericea PhT genes (PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7) were \n\nidentified and partially sequenced. The genomic amplification of H. sericea \n\ngDNA, using degenerated primers based on the conserved regions of PhT1 \n\nsequences from other plant species, resulted in the identification of PiT2 and \n\nPiT6 gene sequences. The subsequent screening of the H. sericea gDNA \n\nlibrary, using PiT2 and PiT6 gene fragments as probes, resulted in the \n\nadditional identification of PH5 and PH7 genes. According to the protein \n\nsequence alignment of higher plant H+/Pi symporters, the partial deduced \n\naminoacid sequences of PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 correspond only to the \n\ntransmembranar domains TMD2, TMD3 and TMD4 of PhT1 proteins.  \n\nThe sequences of 55 higher plant H+/Pi symporters were used for performing \n\nthe phylogenetic analysis of the newly identified H. sericea genes. For \n\nperforming this, all PhT proteins were trimmed before alignment to include only \n\nthe coding region of TMD2, TMD3 and TMD4 (TMD2-4). In this analysis, PhT1 \n\nfrom either dicot or monocot do not cluster in separate groups, contrasting with \n\nthe results previously obtained when considering all the PhT amino acid \n\nsequences. Moreover, PhT1s (TMD2-4) by themselves do not cluster together \n\nalone, as PhT1 complete proteins do, since the hypothetical Na+/Pi symporter \n\nfamily is included in their cluster. These results suggest that TMD2-4 region is \n\n\n\n4.4 DISCUSSION \n\n~ 126 ~ \n\nhighly conserved amongst PhTs from different subfamilies and plant species \n\nand alone do not represent the evolutionary pathway of H+/Pi symporters. To \n\nperform a complete phylogenetic study, other regions of PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and \n\nPH7 proteins must be sequenced and analysed. \n\nThe first expression studies of PhT genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (Muchhal  \n\net al., 1996), Solanum tuberosum (Leggewie et al., 1997) and Lycopersicon \n\nesculentum (Daram et al., 1998) showed high-affinity PhT1 members being \n\nexpressed mainly in root organs of Pi deficient plants. In contrast, low-affinity \n\nPhT members were ubiquitously expressed throughout the whole plant. These \n\nfindings led to the assumption that high-affinity PhT members should be \n\ninvolved in Pi uptake from soil, whereas the translocation of Pi throughout the \n\nplant was carried by low-affinity transporters (Daram et al., 1999). Subsequent \n\nstudies have shown that under Pi deficiency, high-affinity PhT1 members are \n\nalso expressed in other plant parts besides roots (Karthikeyan et al., 2002; \n\nMudge et al., 2002). We have attempted to find a possible relation between the \n\namino acid sequence of PhT1 members and their main expression site. \n\nHowever, the preferential expression site of any given PhT1 is not directly \n\nrelated to its deduced amino acid sequence and cannot be inferred only based \n\non its structure. For example, both LaPT1;1 and LaPT1;2 are expressed in roots \n\nof L. albus (Liu et al., 2001) but seem fairly unrelated. In contrast, At1G20860 \n\nand At5G43340 are structurally alike but are expressed in different A. thaliana \n\nplant organs.  \n\nThe expression studies on similar PhTs that group together into small clusters \n\n(e.g. At5G43350, At5G43350 and At5G43350 or MtPT1;1, MtPT1;2 and \n\nMtPT1;3) show that even structurally similar proteins may have different \n\nphysiological roles. In Medicago truncatula, MtPT1;1 and MtPT1;2 are almost \n\nidentical, sharing 91.6% and 98% sequence identity at the nucleotide and \n\namino acid levels, respectively. However, the expression of MtPT1;1 and \n\nMtPT1;2 genes, evaluated by Northern blot analysis, revealed differences in \n\ntheir expression patterns (Liu et al., 1998b). Although both genes are only \n\nexpressed in roots, MtPT1;1 is much less responsive to Pi fluctuations than \n\nMtPT1;2, which is only induced in Pi deficiency and repressed in Pi sufficiency. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 127 ~ \n\nIn S. tuberosum, StPT1;1 and StPT1;3 share 83,9% amino acid sequence \n\nidentity. Although StPT1;1 seems to encode a low-affinity PhT involved in Pi \n\ntranslocation within the plant and is expressed in different plant parts, StPT1;3 \n\nencodes a high-affinity PhT whose expression is strongly induced in roots due \n\nto arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonisation (Leggewie et al., 1997; Rausch et \n\nal., 2001). Both studies, on M. truncatula and S. tuberosum, suggest that small \n\ndifferences in the protein amino acid sequence are sufficient to completely alter \n\nthe kinetic parameters of the PhT proteins. \n\nIn order to understand the regulation mechanisms of Pi transport in H. sericea, \n\nthe expression patterns and tissue specifity of the four PhT genes in plants \n\ngrown under either high- or low-Pi availability should be analized. \n\n\n\n4.5 REFERENCES \n\n~ 128 ~ \n\n4.6 REFERENCES \n\nAltschul SF, Madden TL, Sch\u00e4ffer AA, Zhang J, Zhang Z, Miller W and Lipman DJ, 1997. \nGapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs. \nNucleic Acid Research Journal 25, 3389\u20133402. \n\nAmijee F, Barroclough PB and Tinker PB, 1991.

GENERAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROTOCOLS \n\n~ 132 ~ \n\nANNEX I. GENERAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROTOCOLS \n\nSpectrophotometric quantification of DNA \n\nQuantification of DNA was performed by spectrophotometry on a Cary 1E UV-\n\nVis Spectrophotometer (Varian). The A260 of diluted sample solution was \n\ndetermined and DNA concentration was estimated taking into account that \n\n1 A260 = 50 ng/?L DNA. Purity was evaluated after determining the values of \n\nA230 and A280 (Sambrook et al., 1989). \n\nNucleic acid electrophoretic separation \n\nDNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis using a horizontal slab gel \n\napparatus. Gel was made by melting agarose in 0.5\u00d7 TBE (45 mM Tris; 45 mM \n\nboric acid; 1 mM EDTA), also used as running buffer. DNA samples, including \nmolecular weight marker (1 kb DNA Ladder, Invitrogen), were mixed with \n\n0.25 vol of loading buffer [glycerol 30% (w/v); 0.1 M EDTA and bromophenol \n\nblue 0.25% (w/v)] and 1 ?L of 1 mg.mL-1 EtBr. Electrophoresis was carried out \n\nat 80 V, until the bromophenol blue dye had reached two thirds of the gel \n\nlength. The agarose gel was visualized under long wave UV light \n\n(Transilluminator 2020E, Stratagene) and analyzed using the Eagle Eye\u00ae II Still \n\nVideo System (Stratagene) through corresponding software (EagleSight\u2122 3.2, \n\nStratagene). \n\nSouthern blotting \n\nTransfer of DNA from agarose gels to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, \n\nAmersham) was performed by the capillary transfer method (Ausubel et al. \n\n1996). After electrophoresis, DNA denaturation was promoted by rinsing the \n\nagarose gel in 0.4 M NaOH for 20 min. A transfer apparatus was set up by \n\nplacing a platform inside a reservoir that contained transfer solution (0.4 M \n\nNaOH). Three sheets of Whatman\u00ae 3MM paper soaked in transfer solution were \n\nlaid on the platform and their ends were immersed into the transfer solution. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 133 ~ \n\nThe agarose gel was placed above the soaked paper. On top of the agarose gel \n\nand cut to gel size were successively layered: (1) the nylon membrane; (2) \n\nthree sheets of soaked Whatman\u00ae 3MM paper; (3) a 7 cm stack of paper \n\ntowels. Finally, a glass plate and a small weight (0.6-1 kg) were placed on top to \n\npromote capillary transfer of reservoir liquid to the absorbing paper towels. \n\nCapillary transfer was allowed to proceed overnight. Nucleic acids were \n\ncrosslinked to the membranes with UV light (120 mJ) on the Stratalinker\u00ae UV \n\ncrosslinker (Model 1800, Stratagene). \n\nHybridization with 32P-labelled DNA probes \n\nDNA fragments were 32P-labeled by random oligonucleotide priming using the \n\nRediprime II DNA labelling system (Amersham) and [?-32P] dCTP (Redivue, \n\nAmersham). Briefly, each DNA probe (100-200 ng) was diluted to a final volume \n\nof 45 ?L in TE buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6); 1 mM EDTA], denaturated at \n\n95\u00b0C for 5 min, and cooled on ice for 5 min. The solution was used to \n\nreconstitute the Rediprime II labelling mix, after which 5 ?L of [?-32P] dCTP \n\n(50 ?Ci) were added. Radioactive nucleotide incorporation was promoted by \n\nincubating the reaction mixture at 37\u00b0C for 1 h.  \n\nRadiolabelled probes were purified from unincorporated nucleotides by gel \n\nfiltration through a Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia) (Sambrook et al., 1989). A \n\nsterile Pasteur pipette was partially blocked with a glass pearl and filled with \n\nSephadex G-50 resin equilibrated in TE buffer. The column was washed with \n\n3 mL of TE and the radiolabelled probe loaded. Size separation by gravity flow \n\nwas promoted by loading into the column one 450 ?L TEN fraction [100 mM \n\nNaCl in TE buffer] followed by twelve 150 ?L TEN fractions. All fractions were \n\nseparately collected in microtubes and evaluated for radioactivity with a mini-\n\nmonitor (Series 900, Morgan). The first 4-5 fractions to present radioactivity \n\nwere pooled. \n\nMembrane filters were pre-hybridized in hybridization buffer [50 mM sodium \n\nphosphate (pH 7.0); 0.9 M NaCl; 5 mM EDTA; 10\u00d7 Denhardt reagent [5% (w/v) \n\nFicoll 400; 5% (w/v) PVP 360; 5% (w/v) BSA (fraction V)]; 0.1% SDS, \n\n250 ?g.mL-1 denatured salmon sperm DNA and 30% (v/v) formamide] at 42\u00b0C, \n\n\n\nANNEX I. GENERAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROTOCOLS \n\n~ 134 ~ \n\nfor 3 h, in a hybridization oven (Amersham). The radiolabelled probe was heat \n\ndenatured for 5 min, cooled on ice and added to the hybridization buffer. \n\nHybridization was allowed to proceed overnight at 42\u00baC, with shaking. After \n\nhybridization, filters were successively washed for 20 min in the following \n\nsolutions: (1) 2\u00d7 SSC [30 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0); 0.3 M NaCl], 0.1% SDS, \n\nat 45\u00b0C; (2) 2\u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 50\u00b0C; (3) 1\u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 50\u00b0C. The \n\nfinal washing step was 1\u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 55\u00b0C. \n\nAutoradiography \n\nRadioactive membrane filters were wrapped in plastic film and placed into \n\nhybridization cassetes (Hypercassete, Amersham) containing two intensifying \n\nscreens (Hyperscreen, Amersham). An autoradiographic film (BioMax MS, \n\nKodak) was put in contact with the membrane and exposure was performed at  \n\n\u201380\u00b0C for the appropriated period (overnight to 1 week). The autoradiographic \n\nfilm was developed in a darkroom by its submersion in X-ray Developer D-19 \n\n(Kodak) for up to 5 min. Development was stopped by rinsing the film in 3% \n\n(v/v) acetic acid stop solution and fixation was performed by submerging the \n\nfilm in Rapid Fixer (Ilford) for 5 min. After rinsing with running water for 5 min, \n\nthe film was dried at room temperature. \n\nTransformation of E. coli cells \n\nPreparation and transformation of E. coli competent cells was performed using \n\nthe method described by Inoue et al. (1990). \n\nCompetent cells were prepared by inoculating 250 mL of SOB medium \n\n[2% (w/v) bacto-tryptone; 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract; 2.5 mM KCl; 10 mM NaCl; \n\n10 mM MgSO4; 10 mM MgCl2] with a single colony of E. coli JM109 (Yanish-\n\nPerron et al., 1985). Cells were grown at 18\u00b0C with vigorous shaking (200-\n\n250 rpm) until A600 = 0.6. The culture was placed on ice for 10 min and cells \n\nwere collected by centrifugation at 2500 g for 10 min at 4\u00baC. The pellet was \n\nresuspended in 80 mL of ice-cold TB buffer (10 mM PIPES; 15 mM CaCl2; \n\n250 mM KCl; 55 mM MnCl2), and left on ice for 10 min. Cells were centrifuged \n\nat 2500 g for 10 min at 4\u00baC, and gently resuspended in 20 mL of ice-cold TB \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 135 ~ \n\nbuffer.

The cell \n\nsuspension was left on ice for 10 minutes and distributed in 200 ?L aliquots, \n\nwhich were immediately placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C.  \n\nTransformation of E. coli cells was initiated by thawing competent cells on ice. \n\nThe DNA sample (1-20 ?L) was added to 200 ?L of competent cells by gentle \n\nmixing, and the mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Cells were heat-\n\nshocked by incubation at 42\u00b0C for 30 s with agitation, followed by 10 min on ice. \n\nAfter addition of 0.8 mL of SOC medium [2% (w/v) bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) \n\nyeast extract, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM \n\nglucose], an incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with vigorous shaking (200-250 rpm) \n\nwas performed. Cells were spun down for a 30 s at 10000 g and the pellet \n\nresuspended in 50 ?L of the supernatant. Finally, cells were transferred to LB \n\nselective plates [1% (w/v) bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) \n\nNaCl, pH 7.0], containing X-gal (40 ?g.mL-1) and IPTG (40 ?g.mL-1), and \n\nincubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. \n\nPlasmid isolation \n\nThe purification of small amounts of DNA to be used in restriction fragment \n\nanalysis was performed by the boiling method (Holmes and Quigley, 1981). \n\nBacteria were grown overnight in the appropriate liquid culture media. An \n\naliquot of 1.5 mL of the culture was collected and centrifuged at 8000 g for \n\n5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 400 ?L of STET [10 mM Tris-HCl \n\n(pH 8.0); 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 5% (v/v) Triton X-100], supplemented \n\nwith 25 ?L of freshly prepared lysozyme solution [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); \n\n10 mg.mL-1 lysozyme]. Lysis was promoted by incubation at room temperature \n\nfor 10 min, followed by incubation at 95\u00baC for 1 min. Denaturated proteins and \n\nchromosomal DNA were removed by centrifugation at 14000 g for 15 min. The \n\nsupernatant was recovered and mixed with 300 ?L of isopropanol to precipitate \n\nplasmid DNA. After centrifugation under the same conditions, the supernatant \n\nwas discarded and the plasmid was resuspended in 20-100 ?L of TE [10 mM \n\nTris-HCl (pH 8.0); 1 mM EDTA]. \n\n\n\nANNEX I. GENERAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY PROTOCOLS \n\n~ 136 ~ \n\nMedium scale isolation of high purity plasmid DNA to be used for sequencing \n\nand probe isolation was performed using the Wizard\u2122 Plus Midipreps DNA \n\nPurification System (Promega), according to the supplier\u2019s instructions. Briefly, \n\nbacteria were grown overnight in the appropriate liquid culture media (100 mL). \n\nThe culture was centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in \n\n3 mL of resuspension buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); 10 mM EDTA; \n\n100 ?g.mL-1 of RNase A] and an equal volume of lysis buffer [200 mM NaOH, \n\n1% (w/v) SDS] was added. The mixture was gentle mixed by swirling until \n\nclearing. The lysate was neutralized by the addition of 3 mL of neutralization \n\nbuffer [1.32 M KOAc (pH 4.8)], followed by gentle mixing. Cell debris was \n\nremoved by centrifugation at 14000 g for 15 min at 4\u00baC. The supernatant was \n\ncombined with 10 mL of the Wizard\u00ae Midiprep DNA Purification Resin \n\n(Promega) and loaded onto the midicolumn. Vacuum was applied to the column \n\nto promote packaging of the resin and 2x15 mL of washing buffer [8.3 mM Tris-\n\nHCl (pH 7.5); 80 mM KOAc; 40 ?M EDTA; 55% (v/v) ethanol] were added. The \n\nmidicolumn was placed inside a microtube and centrifuged at 8000 g for 2 min \n\nto remove any residual washing buffer. The plasmid DNA was eluted by loading \n\n300 ?L of sterile water at 70\u00baC. After incubating for 1 min, the column was \n\ncentrifuged at 8000 g for 20 s to collect the eluted plasmid. The plasmid DNA \n\nsolution was further centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min to precipitate column debris \n\nand the supernatant was stored at -20\u00baC. \n\nDigestion with endonucleases \n\nThe digestion of DNA with restriction endonucleases was performed according \n\nto standard procedures (Sambrook et al. 1989; Ausubel et al. 1996), following \n\nthe supplier\u2019s instructions. Acetylated BSA was used to stabilize endonuclease \n\nactivity. Each reaction contained 1-15.5 ?L of DNA, 2 ?L enzyme buffer (10\u00d7, \n\nRoche), 2 ?L BSA (5 mg/mL, Stratagene), 0.5 ?L restriction enzyme and \n\nultrapure water up to a final volume of 20 ?L. Reactions were performed at \n\n37\u00b0C, for 1.5 h to overnight. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HAKEA SERICEA PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER ENCODING GENES \n\n~ 137 ~ \n\nReferences \n\nAusubel FM, Brent R, Kingston RE, Moore DD Seidman JG, Smith JA and Struhl K, 1996. \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Still, only a few species are able to establish and spread in the new \n\nterritory. Human activity, however, is driving a dramatic increase on the \n\nfrequency and number of invasions, unbalancing and endangering many \n\necosystems (Wells et al., 1986; di Castri, 1989; Cronk and Fuller, 1995). \n\nThe migration of Hakea sericea from south-eastern Australia to countries such \n\nas South Africa, New Zealand or Portugal (Neser and Fugler, 1978; Weber, \n\n2003) is a perfect example of this reckless human activity. Initially introduced as \n\na hedge plant to form fence lines or windbreaks, this Proteaceae species soon \n\nrelied on its xeromorphic adaptations (Groom et al., 1997), high production, \n\nlongevity and dispersion of seeds (Richardson et al. 1989), fire resistance from \n\nboth seeds and rootstocks (Bradstock, 1991), and enhancement of nutrient \n\nuptake by proteoid roots (Shane and Lambers, 2005) to spread and overcome \n\nautochthon populations. Currently, H. sericeae has been reported as an \n\naggressive invader in all of these new habitats. \n\nThe north-western part of Portugal has been severely affected by the invasion \n\nof H. sericea, mainly triggered by the disruption of natural ecosystems by \n\nfrequent forest fires. Taking this into account, one of the aims of the present \n\nwork was to study possible approaches for controlling this invader. As necrotic \n\nlesions of unknown origin were detected in the leaves of wild shrubs of  \n\nH. sericea growing in northern Portugal (\u201cSerra de Arga\u201d), the identification of a \n\npathogenic agent able to infect H. sericea was carried out. Injured tissues were \n\nincubated on PDA, from which a fungal species was isolated. Based on \n\nmorphological characters such as conidia form, cell number, pigmentation and \n\nnumber of appendages, the pathogenic agent was identified as belonging to the \n\nPestalotiopsis genus. Since most species in this genus share the same \n\nmorphological characters (Hu et al., 2007), classification at the species level \n\nwas accomplished through the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of rRNA genes \n\nmolecular marker. The amplification and sequencing of ITS allowed the \n\nidentification of the pathogen as Pestalotiopsis funerea. This ubiquitous species \n\n\n\n5.1 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS \n\n~ 143 ~ \n\nhas been described has pathogenic for many plants, causing necrosis on \n\ninfected tissues, that can ultimately lead to plant death. However, several \n\nstudies regarding the influence of plant health (Keith et al., 2006) and \n\nenvironmental conditions (Tuset et al., 1999) on the success of P. funerea \n\ninvasiveness have shown that this fungal agent behaves as an opportunistic \n\npathogen mostly affecting stressed plants. This feature could make P. funerea a \n\nuseful biological control tool in association with mechanical or chemical \n\nmethods, since non-wounded authocton species would be safe from infection. \n\nAnother main advantage of using P. funerea as a biological agent in northern \n\nPortugal relies on the fact that the pathogen was isolated from the invaded area \n\nby itself.  Consequently, it would not be introduced into the ecosystem for the \n\nfirst time, thus reducing the probability of collateral damage in autochthon \n\nspecies. \n\nSoils from the mountain areas of northern Portugal, likewise many found in \n\nAustralia and in Cape region in South Africa (Lambers et al., 2006), tend to \n\nhave a bellow average concentration of important mineral nutrients, particularly \n\nN and P. This would have a negative impact on the growth and development of \n\nmost plant species. Conversely, H. sericea seems to be perfectly fit to cope with \n\nsuch harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, another aim of this work was \n\nto further understand the ecophysiological mechanisms underlying the ability of \n\nH. sericea to successfully establish in such Pi-poor soils. For studying Pi uptake \n\nby roots of H. sericea, an efficient hydroponic system was firstly developed. The \n\ngrowth of plants in different media showed that proteoid roots are only induced \n\nin solutions with low Pi concentrations \u2013 similarly to those found in the soils of \n\n\u201cSerra de Arga\u201d, in north-western Portugal. Through autoradiography of root \n\nfragments incubated in 32Pi, it was shown that proteoid roots present a higher \n\neffectiveness in uptaking Pi than non-proteoid roots. Pi uptake by itself seems \n\nto be dependent on proton gradient and yielded a biphasic kinetics, suggesting \n\nthe involvement of H+/Pi co-transport systems with distinct substrate affinities \n\n(Km 225 nM and 40.8 \u00b5M Pi). Moreover, the high-affinity Pi transport component \n\ndescribed in this work has the highest Pi affinity characterized to date in plant \n\nroots, matching the values described for Pi transport even in mycorrhiza. We \n\nsuggest that the presence of a Pi uptake system with such high-affinity to Pi \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 - CONCLUSION \n\n~ 144 ~ \n\nmay confer an adaptive advantage for H. sericea over most plants in Pi-poor \n\nsoils. \n\nPhosphate transport from soil to plant and across plant tissues and organelles \n\noccurs through the activity of phosphate transporters (PhT family). Members of \n\nPhT1 subfamily are involved in the uptake of Pi into the cell, thus being located \n\nin the plasma membrane. Transmembrane domain (TMD) prediction showed \n\nthat all PhT1 members must have 12 TMD separated in two groups of six by a \n\nlarge hydrophilic charged loop. Phylogenetic analysis of 55 PhTs distributed \n\nacross 13 plant species clustered PhT1 members altogether, forming two \n\nsubgroups composed by either dicot or monocot proteins. Prediction of \n\ntransmembrane domains in PhT2, a family of chloroplastidial H+/Pi symporters, \n\nsuggests all members must also have 12 TMD. However, in opposition to PhT1 \n\nmembers, the large hydrophilic loop is located between TMD8 and TMD9 and \n\nthe N-terminal contains an extension that functions as a transit peptide, \n\ndirecting the protein to the chloroplast. The phylogenetic analysis shows that all \n\nanalyzed PhT2 members cluster together and do not share homology with \n\nPhT1. Finally, the phylogenetic analysis suggests the existence of a new \n\nchloroplastidial Na+/Pi transporter family, with 10 predicted TMD and a long  \n\nN-terminal chloroplastidial transit peptide. The existence of such family may be \n\nparticularly relevant in halophytes or in plants living in alkaline media. In this \n\nwork, four PhT members were found in H. sericea (PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7). \n\nTransmembrane domain prediction of the deduced amino acid sequence \n\nsuggests all four members belong to the PhT1 subfamily. However, since the \n\ncomplete nucleotide sequences of these H. sericea genes were not achieved, \n\nan accurate phylogenetic analysis including PiT2, PiT6, PH5 and PH7 was \n\nimpaired. \n\nThe possible relation between the amino acid sequence of PhT1 members and \n\ntheir main expression site was studied. Apparently the preferential expression \n\nsite of any given PhT1 may not be inferred based only on its deduced amino \n\nacid sequenced. While some fairly unrelated proteins may be expressed in the \n\nsame tissue (e.g. LaPT1 and LaPT2 in roots), structurally alike PhTs may be \n\nexpressed in different plant organs (e.g. At1G20860 and At5G43340). \n\n\n\n5.2 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES \n\n~ 145 ~ \n\nIn Arabidopsis thaliana, genes enconding high-affinity PhTs are repressed in \n\nthe presence of high concentrations of Pi (Dong et al., 1999). Conversely, when \n\ngrown under high Pi concentration, H. sericea accumulates abnormal amounts \n\nof Pi in the root, stem and leaves that ultimately lead to foliar Pi toxicity \n\nsymptoms. These results suggest that H. sericea may be unable to  \n\ndown-regulate the expression of high-affinity PhT genes in such experimental \n\nconditions. Since H. sericea inhabits Pi impoverished soils in its native habitat, \n\nan efficient mechanism for preventing excessive Pi uptake may have never \n\nbeen developed, or alternatively, could have been lost during evolution. \n\n5.2 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES \n\nFollowing the work described in this thesis, several research lines can be \n\nsuggested:  \n\na) Regarding the control of H. sericea with P. funerea, further studies are \n\nrequired before its environmental application. Since infection was only \n\ntested in six-weeks-old plants, an infection of adult specimens should be \n\nattempted. It would also be interesting to infect plants exposed to \n\ndifferent stresses, such as drought, cold, mechanical injuries or excess \n\nPi to predict in which conditions infection by P. funerea would be \n\nfavoured. Collateral damage on autochthon populations should also be \n\nanticipated, by testing at lab scale the effect of P. funerea on these \n\nspecies. \n\nb) In what concerns Pi homeostasis, it would be imperative to complete the \n\nsequencing of the four genes identified in H. sericea genome. The \n\nexpression analysis of these genes and their tissue specifity in plants \n\nunder high- or low-Pi availability would allow the understanding of Pi \n\ntransport regulation in this plant species. \n\nc)  The functional characterization of the identified Pi transporters genes \n\nthrough heterologous expression (in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) would \n\nallow a more detailed study on their role, kinetic properties, energetics \n\nand specificity. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 - CONCLUSION \n\n~ 146 ~ \n\nd)  Finally, since P is frequently a limiting nutrient for plant growth, it would \n\nbe interesting to assess if the over-expression of these high-affinity Pi \n\ntransporters in other plant species would improve their ability to cope \n\nwith Pi-poor soils. \n\nThe work presented in this dissertation contributed to better understand the \n\necophysiological mechanisms underlying the ability of H. sericea to invade new \n\nhabitats. A new pathogenic agent, P. funerea, was also described as harmful for \n\nthis Australian Proteaceae. It is hoped that these studies can be a starting point \n\nfor the development of integrated control strategies against this aggressive \n\ninvader in Portuguese territory. \n\n\n\n5.3 REFERENCES \n\n~ 147 ~ \n\n5.2 REFERENCES \n\nBradstock RA, 1991.
